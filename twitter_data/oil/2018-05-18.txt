41 2018-05-19 23:56:20 Gillian was satisfied. She had managed in one fell swoop to end the oil smuggling ring, avert an impending ecological disaster if that pirate tanker had run aground on the coral reef, AND procured a steady source of lubricant for her mechanical parts. Oil's well that ends well.
42 2018-05-19 23:56:18 oil companies yes, everything is connected to that.  sadly

51 2018-05-19 23:55:01 @JustinTrudeau We can't even get a handle on our farmed Atlantic salmon issues (it is utterly disgraceful). How can we be relied upon to get the Oil pipeline issues handled competently. We should make sure we have it right before proceeding, as we all drive cars to our protests.
52 2018-05-19 23:54:57 If you have a VERY glossy finish you probably will not want to dull it at all, so you might want to avoid anything, but I often use the tung oil polish over very nice pieces and apply it with 0000 steel wool.

66 2018-05-19 23:52:42 President Uhuru has said production of oil from the Turkana oilfields will start without any  hindrance after an agreement was reached on the sharing of revenue. The  revenue from oil will be shared on the basis of 75% for Kenyans, 20%  -county government & 5%- local community.

70 2018-05-19 23:52:03 Lmao just witnessed people steal oil from a gas station. They were so slick with that 
71 2018-05-19 23:51:46 Under Obama we were gas exporters. Russia is broke & oil is their biggest asset. One reason they are desperate for sanctions to be lifted. Trump to the Russian’s rescue. So what if America has another recession? Trump will make money through secret shares of Russian oil co.

102 2018-05-19 23:45:27 I don't understand this mud slinging between "libs" & "repubs." America's character and moral direction has been declining despite parties. When corporations, elitists, big banks, oil companies, etc. started buying politicians, things worsened.

109 2018-05-19 23:43:51 The reason it started was because the west have taken out the leaders in the third world over disputes over oil etc etc and consequently when the people have nowhere to turn to they turn on each other.

129 2018-05-19 23:39:59 You’re funny. Obtuse, but funny. The point is vanishing spending money for the middle class. Lower gas prices drive other spending. Only Vlad, and his reliance on oil for 83% of his country’s cash, and oil companies happy with the price per barrel

138 2018-05-19 23:37:50 1) tailings isn’t just an oil sands problem - it’s all mining. Including the dozens in BC.
2) no industry comes close to amount oil sands companies spend researching ways to clean them. 
3) no other industry reclaims the land to the extent of oil sands.

149 2018-05-19 23:36:11 @jjhorgan is a two face hypocrite and liar by supporting the USA for oil and gas will only reinforce my spending habits and promote #boycottbc
150 2018-05-19 23:35:58 And marathon petroleum is buying Andeavor for $23 Billion to become the largest oil refiner in the US. Why wasn’t I involved in that deal...to the oil industry I go.

154 2018-05-19 23:35:24 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
155 2018-05-19 23:35:19 Use lemon, baking soda and coconut oil!!

161 2018-05-19 23:34:22 Is someone sick among you? Call the elders of the church, and pray for him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the Prayer of Faith will save the sick and the Lord will raise him up. James 5: 14-15

163 2018-05-19 23:34:09 Now you're being ridiculous. Next, you'll be needing a shovel, to dig yourself a hole.
164 2018-05-19 23:34:04 Not much of a secret x) We give them a good coating of an oil and paprika mix before we cook em for 20-30 mins. When they look done (usually just starting to burn when we do it pff) we leave them in the oven with the door open for 10 mins to crisp up 
165 2018-05-19 23:34:01 Mine was at Con oil, and another at one poorly named filling station like that. I asked to get the number of the owner. After showing them I'm a proper Lagos boy, make dressing no deceive them, they sold my fuel sharply. Rogue people

169 2018-05-19 23:32:50 Had a trans cooler fail on a EF 18 sp and the trany oil and antifreeze mixed so similar except it wasn’t leaking out anywhere.
170 2018-05-19 23:32:30 It depends what type of oil your car takes! Synthetic oil costs way more!
171 2018-05-19 23:31:58 Same age! My whole life I've worked in the sun. No wrinkles but just dry. Yes I bought a huge jar of coconut oil. Yes I know Mane n Tail. When I was in my 30's  I changed my ways. With diabetes, the winter weather must be hard on you, my hands would just be cracking bad.
172 2018-05-19 23:31:57 Good luck with that one, bud. I'll give LoRo motor oil if it'll quite him down at certain points in the day...

175 2018-05-19 23:31:47 I figured it was for oil or money.
176 2018-05-19 23:30:58 They are on their way. They are just very slow. And your tea does not have enough oil in it.
177 2018-05-19 23:30:49 I’ve done benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, I’ve done the oil and water based cleansers, toner and lotion, wash my face twice a day. Face masks of all kinds. Stopped wearing make up. Nothing is working.
178 2018-05-19 23:30:21 Coconut Oil Treatment: (if the oil is solid, melt it by placing the container in a large bowl of heated water). Brush generous amount through hair, especially ends. Leave it on as long as is convenient—anywhere from 30 minutes to overnight. Then wash your hair as normal.
179 2018-05-19 23:30:18 Diet reminders: eat oily fish twice a week and take a fish oil supplement on every other day.
180 2018-05-19 23:30:16 Quick warning; Never shove your hand in a deep fat frier to test if the oil is hot
181 2018-05-19 23:29:54 War machine needs oil
182 2018-05-19 23:29:49 do you use that as a moisturiser? or just a facial oil?
183 2018-05-19 23:29:23 Same, feels like at 31 I’m either going to start fishing and gutting my catch myself or like, living on seeds and using coconut oil as my only beauty product. 32 we just turn into a tree.
184 2018-05-19 23:29:15 Not sure which is worse for the US ... having to swallow the snake oil he's shoveling at us, or watching him pretending he's not buying the same crap from Putin & Un.

188 2018-05-19 23:28:32 My grandpa drove all the way to highlander point and put oil in my car while I was working
189 2018-05-19 23:28:14 If I had been around then, I would have paid to be able to watch filming that day if that were possible. One of my favorite episodes and scenes. But that picture is from the Morning After. The Oil Barons Ball ended with Cliff telling Jr how he was going to tell the whole world

192 2018-05-19 23:27:26 Tax cuts were for the 1% who don't need it. NDP is only arguing for tax hikes on the highly wealthy, not middle or lower class Canadians. Gas prices are increasing because oil tycoons won't take a cut to their bonuses.Bread price hikes were illegal. Average Ontarions ARE insulted
193 2018-05-19 23:27:25 @PepsiCo @pepsi Please buy responsible palm oil so you don’t have to explain your grandchildren who killed the Sumatran tigers and why they can’t see them anymore.

196 2018-05-19 23:26:56 I'll have to try that, what kind of oil? It won't affect them being used later? I saw netting and was going to try that. 

Idk, my other one bounced back fine but one is just said and dying 
197 2018-05-19 23:26:47 When IG Horiwitz's report comes out am gonna bust out the plastic sheeting, cover myself in baby oil and.... Uh, am grossing myself out now. Still gonna do it. Muh swamp!

201 2018-05-19 23:25:16 Try mixing Dawn soap and some oil into a spray bottle and spray it on the herbs. Should stop the bugs. What's going on with the lavender?
202 2018-05-19 23:23:57 It is a good thing that Big Oil isn't ready! If they really understood what they are up against, they probably would be trying harder to stop EVs. If everything goes well, EVs will be impossible to stop before too long and Big Oil will have far less influence over our society.

206 2018-05-19 23:23:15 An independent #Scotland would make money from oil, tourism and fishing.

They have a small population, so their tax revenues could be reinvested in education, healthcare and infrastructure. 

Norway is similar but Scotland would probably opt for full EU membership,
with a say
207 2018-05-19 23:23:04 Honestly,. I wouldn't want to be anywhere *near* the middle east when the oil runs out/is replaced. That will  not be a pretty day.

211 2018-05-19 23:21:57 Have any residents of #Banbury noticed how run down and tired the tow looks in the last 6-12 months? It’s never been an oil painting, but it’s dropped off a cliff recently
212 2018-05-19 23:21:49 I use my oil pen like it’s a regular vape & I always end up just super high
213 2018-05-19 23:21:42 Essential oils like lavender, tea tree etc are too potent just for skin so you need to mix a few drops with a carrier oil like almond, coconut, jojoba etc

215 2018-05-19 23:21:30 TSP is very 'basic'. It saponifys the oils in grease. Same process as lye and animal fat making soap. When painting, it is a good idea to rinse with vinegar to neutralize the  TSP so it doesn't turn the oil in your paint into a soap film. -former paint contractor : )
216 2018-05-19 23:21:30 Vaseline mixed with Olive oil, the best treatment. Spread well in both nostrils and sleep. Try it. You’ll thank me for this nuskha.

228 2018-05-19 23:18:46 I had a scar from a burn once. What helped was exfoliating (put sunlight brick on your vaaslaap and directly scrub it) it each time you wash, and applying tissue oil and at night . 
It didn’t vanish though but it is barely visible 
229 2018-05-19 23:18:22 You know those Febreze car clip jobbies for the A/C fan? Would those work on the household A/C fan by my bed? It's a VERY small space (efficiency apartment, a wall w/o doors separates the bedroom and front room), and the oil warmer thingy doesn't really reach there.

235 2018-05-19 23:17:38 Clean coal is what trump says for votes. He has no intention of doing anything. Oil and gas fill his pockets with money, not coal. Trump is not invested in solar or wind so those go overlooked too.

262 2018-05-19 23:13:53 A large percentage of corn, soy etc that is fed to stock is what’s left over after the oil & proteins etc have been extracted 
Eg, every kg of cotton there’s 1.3 kg of cottonseed, oil is extracted leaving 1kg of cottonseed meal which is stockfeed 
 ‘Meal’ means waste byproduct
263 2018-05-19 23:13:51 Are we to point of applying coconut oil?
264 2018-05-19 23:13:50 After sandbags are done and waters recede, how about BC suing the petro corporations that cause this?  NYC, SF and nine jurisdictions in the USA have sued oil companies for costs incurred because of global warming that they knowingly are causing.
265 2018-05-19 23:13:48 It is not hidden is most likely the NRA, oil companies, coal companies, or AT&T trying to undermine net neutrality or Norvartis trying to keep us paying thousand of dollars for medicines that cost pennies to make.

278 2018-05-19 23:11:56 Thank you! Had a good friend tell me the same. I think is confusing in Ky. They're growing alot of hemp here for Cbd oil but I really don't know if I can buy it or where. I had seizures with Neurontin & OcyCodon, just tried Norco after back surgery, but problems with it too. 
279 2018-05-19 23:11:51 I despise Trump.

The high prices are due to a confluence of events. The oil glut is over & OPEC have start to rig prices again. They're the main contributory factors. Trump's pull-out of the Iran deal has added a few cents to the price. Let's not spread fake news - please!

289 2018-05-19 23:10:10 I'd oil up his joints, if ya know what I mean.
290 2018-05-19 23:09:47 I'm sorry I came across that way.
I don't know how long I've had #CRPS?  Still no Dr. who knows anything! 
#Fibro #osteoarthritis other things I won't mention, all painful, no answers but toxic pharmaceuticals I won't take, & can't take.
CBD Oil is working, less pain meds!

292 2018-05-19 23:09:25 I really need to do this hot oil treatment but I’m super tired.
293 2018-05-19 23:09:14 This one w| long natural nails was saying that she soaks her nails in ACV for 15mins then washes it off & soaks another 15mins in olive oil.. I haven’t tried it tho.
294 2018-05-19 23:09:13 おはよう
295 2018-05-19 23:09:12 I also like the taste of coconut oil (insert joke about coconut cream pie).
296 2018-05-19 23:09:05 You have to call in to Talk of Gasoline Alley and ask about the seawater powered car from 1955. I'm sure Donald knows everything about it, including the part about the oil companies.
297 2018-05-19 23:09:01 YOU DUMPED THE OIL TYCOON FROM DUBAI?! I liked him tho

Qatar Rosneft oil comes out
Even cult may have knees bend
302 2018-05-19 23:07:50 "keeping folks in welfare programs"  .   hmmm interesting.  Shall we talk about corporate welfare?  Just how much longer will oil/gas comps be taking subsidies?  Or how 'bout the Noem family?  still taking that corporate welfare?
303 2018-05-19 23:07:47 Or oil money or...
304 2018-05-19 23:07:29 Suateed pancetta and garlic in some (good) olive oil, tossed in spaghetti, then mixed in 3 eggs/1 yolk/cup of grated parmesan/black pepper
305 2018-05-19 23:07:25 Oh my giddy aunt.
306 2018-05-19 23:07:23 put some castor oil on your brows every night before bed , worked for me
307 2018-05-19 23:07:22 I put olive oil on my hair goingprepoo
308 2018-05-19 23:07:21 peppermint oil is the cure to all sunburns.
309 2018-05-19 23:07:12 It's more of an oil slick than a deep rooted thing. We should be able to scrape it off and move forward.
310 2018-05-19 23:06:53 My Grandaddy really making me pay him for a oil change and to get my breaks fixed  taking about all ima do is buy shoes
311 2018-05-19 23:06:41 Beard oil = Major 
312 2018-05-19 23:06:39 In Canada we are paying $6 CAD a gallon and we have the second largest oil reserves in the world.
313 2018-05-19 23:06:33 Coal is not clean. Even if we ignore global effects. The pollution given off kills people if near them. Can cause cancer and destroy the environment. Even digging it up is horrible. Get off the coal and oil train, they won’t last the century. The sun will, water will, wind will.
314 2018-05-19 23:06:27 Exodus 27:20-21a, ESV

"You shall command the
people of Israel that they
bring to you pure beaten
olive oil for the light, that
a lamp may regularly be
set up to burn.
In the tent of meeting,
outside the veil that is
before the testimony,
Aaron and his sons
shall tend it. . ."

318 2018-05-19 23:06:06 Dear Feld Motorsports the Lucas Oil Pro Motocross series just showed highlights of Zach Osbourne winning his SX titles hence showing the 2nd aspect to this awesome sport. Now that’s how you help grow the sport not just the (night) show.

322 2018-05-19 23:05:41 Shower cap!!! When I’m doing a hot oil treatment, I slap on one of them plastic bags.

325 2018-05-19 23:05:15 Psalm 23:5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
326 2018-05-19 23:05:07 #DidYouKnow  J. M. W. Turner depicted the fishermen of #Shoeburyness in his oil painting Shoeburyness Fishermen Hailing a Whitstable Hoy.

329 2018-05-19 23:04:47 Oh hey. I heard add vegetable oil to dishsoap...
330 2018-05-19 23:04:27 Put yourself in her position, you'd be advocating for change too. The same thing happened to the slaves more than a century ago. Your country needs to get past its ancient thinking if it wants to be respected for more reasons than just your oil and guns. Women are not 2nd class.
331 2018-05-19 23:04:23 Wow! They all got up and went for their bikes, mad. Oil spill?
332 2018-05-19 23:04:22 I bought a lowkey expensive ass massage oil and ain’t even get rubbed on, pity.
333 2018-05-19 23:04:19 The Axis of Oil: Russia, Saudi Arabia & Texas.
334 2018-05-19 23:03:49 Can't think of any reasons besides Oil $$$.
335 2018-05-19 23:03:39 “You got a blowout?” Noooooo small straightening sections & weightless oil will work wonders
336 2018-05-19 23:03:30 I made pesto and added spinach in addition of basil, and substituted avocado instead of olive oil. let me tell u. this pesto is amazing
337 2018-05-19 23:03:28 Did my invite get lost in the mail?
338 2018-05-19 23:02:46 If you're going to sell snake oil to a bunch of rubes, you gotta look the part
339 2018-05-19 23:02:46 that was rough
340 2018-05-19 23:02:43 Luckily your red states do dig holes in the mud very well and pump our oil so I can't say you don't bring so many incredible innovations to the table lol. We'll cover enriching lives you handle the shovel. We'll each do what we do breast and leave it at that. Enjoy a blue Nov.
341 2018-05-19 23:02:38 You've been misguided.  Venezuela's problems have nothing to do with socialism, capitalism, or any other xyz-ism.  The country became too dependant on high-priced oil and their leader made some really bad moves to counter the effect.  ..that's it.
342 2018-05-19 23:02:28 Did a full weeks shopping today and managed to avoid any product containing palm oil - took a bit of effort and had to put a few favourites back but it will get easier #saynotopalmoil #redape
343 2018-05-19 23:02:26 It might not be as simple as turning to Washington state. Alaskan production their main source, is declining, which may mean California oil. Not sure how much they have to spare either. Either way they would be paying WTI price as well.
344 2018-05-19 23:02:19 Thanks Vivian for all your work. 
I imagine people behind the US initiative to landlock Canadian oil are also trying to destabilize Venezuela. If Venezuela were able to produce oil from the La Luna source rock as is done in the Midland basin, it would displace all US oil exports
345 2018-05-19 23:02:15 The MSM and Beckett's fictions are like oil and water.

360 2018-05-19 22:58:36 Most of my friends are at EDC, PRIDE, or graduating... I got an oil change and car wash. And it looks like it’s going to rain soo... there’s that.
361 2018-05-19 22:58:26 Did you know in 1955 a car entered and completed all 500 laps of the #Indy500 powered by seawater? bought by an oil company and never seen again!

365 2018-05-19 22:57:00 B.I.T.U.M.E.N., not oil. D.I.L.B.I.T.,  not oil. I urge you to learn the difference and the untenable risks to land & water, with which no people can live without.
366 2018-05-19 22:57:00 Coconut oil/ olive oil before showering
367 2018-05-19 22:56:59 Well, I am not sure increased production and opening up US oil for trade has worked out so great. In January Gov. Brown increased CA gas tax by $.44 cents. Regular unleaded is now $3.59, up from $2.59 after the CA tax hike. If this is progress, I want regress, this is to stupid.
368 2018-05-19 22:56:55 Vehicle maintenance sucks! Oil changes, tire rotations, new tires..

374 2018-05-19 22:56:15 I’m eating the thc oil out of my vape in a minuet it’s ran out of battery.
375 2018-05-19 22:55:54 Gas hasn't been this high since the Republicans were in office. My guess is that it's going to $4.00 per gallon like it did under Bush. Studies show that more than this does permanent damage to the economy. So the oil companies will stop there to keep their GOP protectors.
376 2018-05-19 22:55:42 You should know when Christians talk na. Unrealistic prayers and unthinking amen
377 2018-05-19 22:55:41 I recently discovered that they absorb all the oil then look like they're gonna burn for a couple minutes, then when you start to get concerned they spit all the oil back out again. They just like 2 play games

391 2018-05-19 22:53:32 But of course if gas prices rise, Russia benefits even more from its oil reserves. They never were fans of the Iran deal for that reason = lower pump prices = less income for Russia

416 2018-05-19 22:47:30 I just watched a sermon on the woman that washed Jesus’ feet with oil and her hair. It was by pastor David Uth at first baptist church of Orlando. Convicting and touching.

428 2018-05-19 22:45:40 This is true. I read an article where a native interviewee said that they couldnt pick medicines in a logging area because the energy of the system had changed. I think if we’re going to plant it has to be our communities doing so, not logging companies or oil companies.
429 2018-05-19 22:45:35 We put a hydraulic oil heat transfer kit on made by Smallaire in Horsham. Easy to bolt on but had to adjust our hydraulic plumbing back to tractor and also have to run the fan a bit quicker (400-500rpm)as it does restrict the air inflow a bit. Works well though.

432 2018-05-19 22:45:14 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
433 2018-05-19 22:45:11 It was to benefit American citizens from a snake oil salesmen. Who has sold off every bit of this country to the highest enemy bidder. You ARE the swamp.
434 2018-05-19 22:45:06 It is like the precious oil upon the head,
Coming down upon the beard;

That cometh down upon the collar of his garments.. #thecreated #newcreation #repentandwalk #exampleSonofman

437 2018-05-19 22:44:36 The clear over bare metal does funny things in my pants.

It's also cool to see all the metal splicing for the chopped top. The chrome oil pan for a center console is an interesting touch. Wish I got more pictures, but the owner came to leave and we chatted. Cool piece of art!
438 2018-05-19 22:44:36 LOL, clearly you do not have any understanding of politics and regional conflicts. The only reason the US went into #Iraq, the #Mideast, and is allies with #SaudiArabia is OIL. Despite the fact that Saudis have committed #WarCrimes and created #Wahabbism. #ICC4SaudiArabia
439 2018-05-19 22:44:31 it can only happen if oil is traded in crypto - "governments" aren't ran on currency (even if the USA has temporarily been exempted by the "petro-dollar"), but, on the hydrocarbons that underlies everything. beginning with food
440 2018-05-19 22:44:31 aren't the burgers fried in the same oil as the meat? or microwaved so all flaccid and limp ?
441 2018-05-19 22:44:27 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
442 2018-05-19 22:44:21 おはよー！！！
443 2018-05-19 22:44:11 But if OIL keep it's grounds big Frakckers will survive. That's a Big If.i think comes The Fall .not only tree leaves will be falling.

450 2018-05-19 22:43:05 I’ve literally never hated anything more then being an adult right now, Just bought $130 tires, need $120 for my sticker, $300 for my car, $170 for car insurance plus another $100 to renew it plus a $60 oil change FUCK MY LIFE
451 2018-05-19 22:42:57 Wow...yet another day in the engine room of Nigeria. Groundnut oil used in place of fuel lol. This man should stop granting interviews..

454 2018-05-19 22:41:59 Washed my car and got my oil changed , now all that's left is to get a haircut and watch the boston l, Cleveland game.

456 2018-05-19 22:41:26 Wow!  A senior reporter for Huff Post!  Hey, Sir Lie-a-lot!  Go sell your snake oil somewhere else.  We're not buying.
457 2018-05-19 22:41:26 And yes I've been waiting a really long time to use the word "apropos" in a facetious tweet. Just in case anyone was wondering.
458 2018-05-19 22:41:26 “Doing something strange for an oil change” LMAOOOO
459 2018-05-19 22:41:22 I can’t remember which oil I used 28 years ago to speed up contractions but my son nearly ejected himself off the table in the delivery room! Husband said thank G for the umbilical ford, or he would have bungee-jumped right off it!
460 2018-05-19 22:41:19 There better be tension. B.C. has no right to dictate the flow of oil. More pipes, less trains is safer. Horgan is a radicalized eco-nut. Notley better crush this fool, or Kenney will. #TransMountain
461 2018-05-19 22:41:08 Wow...yet another day in the engine room of Nigeria. Groundnut oil used in place of fuel lol. This man should stop granting interviews.
462 2018-05-19 22:41:05 Use heart healthy cooking oils such as olive oil, canola oil or mustard oil. Avoid sunflower oil, safflower oil, ghee, butter, margaraine.
463 2018-05-19 22:40:43 Stop these oil terrorism
464 2018-05-19 22:40:31 Hey Shell Oil just to let you know (based on your commercial) not only dads are truck drivers. My mom could out drive probably any dad out there so hey don't say annoying stuff like that.

466 2018-05-19 22:39:59 When it all comes right down to it this is going to end up being about energy - short term the price of oil.

Long term it will be about who controls the alternatives.

Now which countries have a vested in energy markets and keeping the US stuck in the 50s?

468 2018-05-19 22:39:31 Stiff bristle brush, hot water and detergent. Then dry and coat of oil.
469 2018-05-19 22:38:49 This is like drawing an association between NFL players and an oil business that the team owner made all his money at. Are the players “de facto” oil business employees? 
470 2018-05-19 22:38:35 I think one of the biggest annoyances that come with living in Austin (which I guess also applies with living in any any large-ish city) is getting my oil changed.

As to why #WTI has so many opposite trends coexisting at the same time, the closest analogy is the design of analog watches. the adjacent gears must turn in opposite directions to make the watch work. Similarly, opposite trends move #US #Oil forward in alternating waves.

475 2018-05-19 22:37:52 He has to push up the price to help his friends.

I'd also guess that pushing up the price on oil is helpful for the coal mine owners, because coal is getting more expensive than renewables.
476 2018-05-19 22:37:24 How do you think the clintons amassed their millions? Starting a business and not paying taxes through abusive tax shelters? Try Gross corruption on an industrial scale - much worse than  Saudi princes who at least control oil through a blatant autocracy.
477 2018-05-19 22:36:56 DO U THINK MASSIVE MIGRATION,MASSIVE DEBT,NO JOBS,EXCESSIVE TAXES ,CARBON TAX, M-1O3, RUIN THE OIL EXPORTS,KILL PIPELINES,IS A PERFECT POSITION ?????
478 2018-05-19 22:36:48 Iran ditched the Dollar for the Euro since ‘16... TOTAL/CEPSA/LUCOIL are buying & securing an oil supply despite the US withdrawal... u can apply the old saying “follow the money”. The deal violations ir a ruse.

483 2018-05-19 22:35:26 They are usually natural gas generators and all you need to do is get oil that you have to refill in it every 6 or so hours. Definitely worth it
484 2018-05-19 22:35:19 Oil is now $80 per barrel.
485 2018-05-19 22:35:14 Because the alternative is relying on oil from Iran and gas from Russia.

492 2018-05-19 22:35:00 Hello everyone I'd like to announce I officially am using rose oil as fragrance this summer. That's it.

494 2018-05-19 22:35:00 What are you using oil color or acrylic in your work!
495 2018-05-19 22:34:55 Its a pretty obvious conspiracy of right wing oil and gas dependent authoritarian regimes to hang onto and assert their power.
496 2018-05-19 22:34:50  thats because g+ has it. And twitter is not supposed to copy.

Pata nai logun ko biryani mai kya dikhta hai.. basmati + any masala u can think of + chicken/meat/beef (veg indian rails ka alawa kahin nai milte) + water /oil.

497 2018-05-19 22:34:44 True. They’ve somehow decided Albertans are different / terrible because we see the oil sands as essential, not evil. They’ve swallowed the eco-extremist lie hook, line and sinker. It’s a strange and pretty simple-minded assumption to make about one’s fellow countrymen and women.
498 2018-05-19 22:34:37 The Alberta reaction feels visceral: "you're cutting off our livelihood!" The trouble is, oil sands developments will peter out, sooner rather than later. Who will be blamed next when Albertans are told they can't develop new leases? Ottawa isn't talking about this, but needs to.
499 2018-05-19 22:34:36 She just didn't return from a holiday to Texas, with one line from Jeff about her meeting an oil millionaire! But I too loved the set up with Jeff, Nikki and Lee in the council house. Later joined by Tash upon her return.
500 2018-05-19 22:34:06 Wasn't he a Mayor of San Francisco before, says it all right there.
Actually, IF they were talking about developing 'Magrav Technology' as renewable energy instead of Wind or Solar, it would make sense to drop oil, gas n coal.
But they're not.
501 2018-05-19 22:33:48 It's a common pratice in many products nowadays 
I was going to buy olive oil and then look closely to the bottle and it said it was 45% olive oil and 55% soy oil

512 2018-05-19 22:32:18 There is more to this than just environmental concerns. Oil tankers cruise in and out of the Juan Dr Fuca everyday. Also, trains have never stopped moving oil by rail. Someone likes their AB oil at a discount

515 2018-05-19 22:31:40 There is no way in this great country America anyone should have to pay more than $2 for a gallon of gas. I don’t want to hear about a healthy economy when people will have to cut back their buying to pay for gas to get to work. Let’s stop being bullied by the oil companies.

529 2018-05-19 22:29:07 Yes, it really doesn't help that some people still bang on about the 'Israeli lobby', when that's not the issue.  The American oil lobby is where the power & wealth really sits.

546 2018-05-19 22:26:33 Please stop using that word.  It makes you look like an idiot. Oil prices are not “proof” though they can be an indication.  They are a decision made by the international community for output.  Stop being a damn foot.
547 2018-05-19 22:26:24 I guess you are wrong. In fact, it's Englands who not respect kelpers before war in 1982. Even oil, food & a lot of another things which kelpers use in those days becames from Argentina. England never concerns about kelpers in that vein.England just do it nowadays.That's the fact

563 2018-05-19 22:22:53 I rarely use heat. Thats the main thing. I always keep my hair moisturized with products that have natural coconut oil, shea butter, castor oil, argon oil, jojoba oil, and use products WITH NO SULFATE.
564 2018-05-19 22:22:45 Oh no, say it ain't so, Podesta, Clinton and Obama were colluding together on behalf of the pro Russia Ukrainian political group, is this the same group that Manafort is being investigated for. Why haven't we heard about Podesta ownership in a Russian oil company.

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
570 2018-05-19 22:21:10 Everyone knows including you that our country has no responsibility about 911   even if there were Saudis involved in that shit! It's simple to know who runs to manipulate the world!! We have the oil & money, and others targeting these things by using stupid people to condemn us.
571 2018-05-19 22:20:50 alpha lipoic acid with a drop of moroccan argan oil and the lactic acid and the 30% AHA BHA peel !! I love u you’re so sweet to me 
572 2018-05-19 22:20:47 Are you there trying to figure out how to steal their oil? #GreenWashing
573 2018-05-19 22:20:36 After Independence, the tax on petrol and diesel might be used to counter oil price fluctuations. Probably not with the current environmental stance, but the economic benefit might win out and the environmental concerns swayed by being able to hold pricing as the oil price falls.

575 2018-05-19 22:20:33 mom: pull up your GPS so we can get home. 
me: I know how to get home from here. 
mom: how do you know this area so well?
me: ... because I didn't fuck a guy a few blocks from here a few times until I realized he had an oil painting of a clown on his wall?
576 2018-05-19 22:20:30 Lamp oil, rope, DONGS. You want it?
577 2018-05-19 22:20:27 Who wants to make a Muslim registry, but I was also courteous enough to use coconut oil, something I can't stomach.
578 2018-05-19 22:20:17 bruh ive been at a mechanics garage all day now my hair smells like motor oil 
579 2018-05-19 22:20:11 I love a good oil....
580 2018-05-19 22:19:54 looks like bakths are burning mid night oil and desperately cooking up  silly jokes!
581 2018-05-19 22:19:44 IMNSHO the other item Putin wants from Trump in return for the Presidency of the United States is American (Exxon Mobil) equipment and expertise to drill for oil in the Russian arctic. I believe that’s what Tillerson was supposed to be up to.
582 2018-05-19 22:19:35 Does that change the fact that city is a team of oil money?
583 2018-05-19 22:19:22 Ya se que no estás acá, pero no deja de ser verdad que una experiencia a tu lado, es algo épico
584 2018-05-19 22:19:09 Wouldn't it be terrific if the NRA could organize a special counsel of wealthy celebrities or maybe even sell sponsorships to banks and oil companies to pick up the funeral expenses of all future victims of mass shootings?
585 2018-05-19 22:19:00 <油botとは永遠のライバルであり、良い友達です
586 2018-05-19 22:19:00 Russia produces an average 11 million barrels a day. If we take today's Brent oil prices (79) it translates to 317 billion dollars per year worth oil. They have a population of 140 million so per head they produce  2265$ per year . I suppose being big in oil means nothing then
587 2018-05-19 22:18:58 Someone’s getting a pizza a la mode with my shittles. Talk about the finest of truffle oil

591 2018-05-19 22:18:13 When you a witch and nothing gets past you including an oil change done wrong I just saved me from driving with no oil
592 2018-05-19 22:18:04 Gasoline prices are already rising fast. I read over $3.00 this summer. Plus, this gives Trump another excuse to push drilling off the Atlantic coast & in Nat’l parks. We had a surplus of oil under Obama, but, then, Obama was not lining his own pockets.
593 2018-05-19 22:17:39 I never had it happen, just threatened, but I'm sure knowing my Mother she would have had a big giant dose of Castor Oil just for good measure.
594 2018-05-19 22:17:30 Women have repurposed astrology as a closed system for talking about personality types and their interactions. Newspaper horoscope columns don't give you investment advice or tell you when to change your oil.
595 2018-05-19 22:17:24 Shame Canada only has 1 customer for our oil,  the only resource our neighbors to the south really want.  (nice of us to sell it to them at a price below market value too)
596 2018-05-19 22:17:11 Wouldn't it be terrific if the NRA could organize a special counsel of wealthy celebrities or maybe even sell sponsorships to banks and oil companies to pick up the funeral expenses of all future victims of mass shootings?
597 2018-05-19 22:17:07 Galveston, where oil and sands meet.  The world beautiful doesn't come to mind.
598 2018-05-19 22:17:07 You have to tell the story of virunga national park. The british soco oil company  and the relation with the armed groups ans government on corruption. Tell how the rangers are killed to defend gorilas,  wild life and biodervisity from human greed.
599 2018-05-19 22:16:53 Fat, oil, or alcohol isn't the problem.  The problem is the "flavor" - the synthetic chemicals used to make "flavor" - the chemicals nobody wants to talk about so they focus on fat and oil and alcohol or compare it to food instead of listing what's in it.
600 2018-05-19 22:16:52 My reputation with my friends was always being an almost comically careful driver. But for some reason I booked it, probably close to 90 MPH to find the nearest rest stop. I needed to call home. For some reason I didn't think to just call from the car. Panic makes you act weird.
601 2018-05-19 22:16:46 Chef Louis cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with grass.
602 2018-05-19 22:16:43 So US warns Russia and Germany of sanctions, if they don't sanction their own economy, to make way for US oil, by stopping Nord-stream project. Makes complete sense, under Trump. #MAGA

607 2018-05-19 22:16:10 #MedicalMarijuana fun. First time using, spilled some of oil on hand. First thought, wipe it off. Second thought, this spill is expensive. I wiped my oily hand across my neck, in hope cannabis oil would absorb into my skin. Eau de Marijuana. As long as it stops the pain.

609 2018-05-19 22:15:36 Your next step, sir, should be you allow the oil industry to build at least 3 new state of the art refineries. Increasing the supply of USA refined oil into gasoline will cause gas pump prices to PLUNGE!  Once gasoline prices hit $1.25 per gallon, 2020 is guaranteed!

611 2018-05-19 22:15:09 If any of you uses CBD oil, be cautious of fake imitations.

What many companies do is putting in a lot of filler, and only having enough CBD so they can LEGALLY call it as such. 

In reality, it's trash, does nothing, and you'll waste your $.

the tortoise emblem triggers if you have an hour accumulated time inside boxes and oil drums across a single playthrough

the idea is to recognize your specific playstyle

my playstyle just doesn't really include boxes and oil drums so here we are
614 2018-05-19 22:14:58 My mentions are an actual mess. American Twitter have invaded me like I have hidden oil in my account.
615 2018-05-19 22:14:51 Bohrman isnt anything close to resembling a rational voice when it comes to either then environment or the economy. She is an extremist and her being included in anything to do with oil sands development shows glaring lack of judgement by our gov. Ineptitude if you will.
616 2018-05-19 22:14:50 It was April 15th, 2013. An hour later I was back on the road to North Carolina when I just happened to be listening to NPR and they just happened to announce that a bomb had gone off at the Boston Marathon. My dad's office was in Copley Square nearby.
617 2018-05-19 22:14:49 I worked mostly on the projects , all named different sea birds at the time cos it was 70s when they were bringing oil and Gas back from the rigs in the North Sea
618 2018-05-19 22:14:37 Could it have possibly been to create enough instability to influence global oil prices? Take a gander at who benefits most from higher  crude prices.
619 2018-05-19 22:14:35 @ATTSportsNetRM #ToyotaTalk The Swiss Army knife needs oil big time.  And Buddy needs a new hook.
620 2018-05-19 22:14:30 Ditched the booze and now using CBD oil to ease my anxiety. Doesn’t get ya high one bit, but is still illegal in most states. Ain’t that some shit.
621 2018-05-19 22:13:51 I really despise this type of journalism when the writer omits the part that the person in question is an investor in the company. It could be snake oil for all we know or it could actually help people with concussions?

624 2018-05-19 22:13:41 There's really no evidence that hydrocarbons are exclusively from fossils, as opposed to being a naturally occurring part of Earth's crust. Particularly as they exist in other planets. Read chapter 8 of my book for a discussion of why oil is not limited in any meaningful way
625 2018-05-19 22:13:35 Hulot justifie: "on ne peut tout avoir du jour au lendemain". Mais la vitesse de la transition est bien trop lente. Pour un minimum de cohérence, une telle bio-raffinerie devrait être un projet mort-né.

706 2018-05-19 22:00:37 Except in the case of Scotland it actually is, a democratic deficit, brexit against its wishes, stolen oil and 6000 miles of the north sea, the broken VOW, Trident it rejects,  devolution reversed, eyes on privatising the NHS, and reserved powers.

Nationalism , its emancipation.

714 2018-05-19 21:58:19 Just as all the big car mfg’s start reducing small cars and focusing on trucks and suv’s, oil starts jumping pushing people away from suv’s and back to small cars. Agree this was a mistake. They should have done that 3-4 years ago, and be going the other way now, or soon.
715 2018-05-19 21:58:18 It's all about controlling the oil
716 2018-05-19 21:57:52 FYI. E-juice canNOT contain any fat, oil or (single) alcohols. The flavours are only carried by PG or VG. Having fats oils or alcohols in the vape liquid will give lung problems. Except for countries with bans on vaping you find illigal made juice that might contain it.
717 2018-05-19 21:57:49 The meeting of Don Jr and the Saudis was a summit between the world's largest oil producers.

720 2018-05-19 21:56:31 Last one. Cut up some potatoes into 4,season,drizzle some oil, pop into the oven. Chop up some tomatoes, onions, garlic, Chili, green pepper. Get any fresh fish of your choice. Sear for a minute on either side. Remove small oil from the pan, toss in your garlic,onions,chili. Stir
721 2018-05-19 21:56:09 BC is looking to get oil from the State of Washington.  So....they're not against oil....just Canadian oil.

725 2018-05-19 21:55:25 What the Buhari government calls beating recession is only a slight bump in our fortunes and its more down to rising oil prices than the expertise of any person among the clueless lot that gather to hold meetings every wednesday.

733 2018-05-19 21:53:48 Meanwhile, back at the wallet of average Americans, the price of oil is zooming upward. Can hardly wait to see what it takes to heat my house next winter, as I watch the profits go to Trump's criminal cronies worldwide!

738 2018-05-19 21:53:09 There's still plenty of oil in the Austin Chaulk. A driller friend told me they didn't just cap good producing wells in central Texas, they plugged them with concrete. He said the reason was they could buy foreign oil at a cheaper price. Idk... it doesn't make any sense.

740 2018-05-19 21:52:43 Not only that. When Modi took over luckily for him the crude oil prices were lowest yet he didn't' controlled it. Now the crude oil prices are going sky high and fuel prices will automatically go high. Modi's unluck and downfall started with Karnataka defeat.

Many studies done.  Pot oil also said to cure.  Don't know about studies.

756 2018-05-19 21:48:31 It's already been happening here & around Aus for decades, but now China is moving ever closer & more bold, because they know there's SFA our government can do about it. Once they bomb the place and kill us all, using our steel we sold them, then they'll drill the reef for oil !
757 2018-05-19 21:48:19 If only I were a Russian oil oligarch with bribe money he might listen to reason.  And that's a legitimate suggestion that is hyperbole free and everyone knows it whether or not they admit it out loud.
758 2018-05-19 21:48:07 Indee it was the discovery of scottish oil that showed the union for what it really is.

760 2018-05-19 21:47:47 I think that looking at H Clinton would produce similar conspiracies. the USNA needs a party that is not bought by the international corporations. I was reading online that the only petro state that can be called a democracy is perhaps Norway and their country owns its own oil co
761 2018-05-19 21:47:16 Can the Candice and Tomi match be a baby oil match ?
762 2018-05-19 21:47:13 It would have been coal, but I wouldn't be surprised if they convert it to oil. Easier to get oil delivered trackside these days.

765 2018-05-19 21:46:56 Yup energy independence that’s what I want! Less reliance on the Middle East for oil since most of them want to kill us! Funding countries to kill Americans is not my idea of making America great but having our own fuels is!
766 2018-05-19 21:46:26 if u really need do it now cos later oil will have increased costs.  Dont forget ccl tax not yet in either!
767 2018-05-19 21:45:49 I bet Tae's nudes are all oil on canvas
768 2018-05-19 21:45:43 Is it really on its way out ?? There isn’t any other energy source that’s capable of producing what oil does. I support alt. & complimentary energy sources but we’re a long ways off from not needing oil. BTW how are you heating your home & cooking your food ? Drive a car ? Fly?
769 2018-05-19 21:45:28 "Drain the Swamp" you seriously still think ANYONE believes that is your intention when you have Scott Pruitt still in your cabinet. You sanction Iran to open up oil for buddy, putin,  qutar  and on and on.  We all know:  YOU ARE THE SWAMP!!
770 2018-05-19 21:45:25 Across the Conservative movement in Canada we’re seeing record levels of lying. The price of oil has been climbing steadily for 6 months. That’s why gas prices are up. Find a new fake narrative, buddy.

777 2018-05-19 21:43:41 Great & positive dream, but we can only have all these good things when we have a strong economy. And we cannot have a strong economy if we don’t have healthy reserves especially when oil revenue can slump at anytime. Nobody will invest in a country where there’s forex crisis....

The fears of supply disruption due to looming #sanctions on #Iran #oil exports are overcooked. Here is why: 
1.#China & #India will buy up Iranian oil.
2. #OPEC's deal of production cuts is not ironclad. It may be gone before Iran sanctions are in place in November.

804 2018-05-19 21:38:39 At the same time, the fact is that flights will become (much) more expensive as oil dwindles. It depends wether what constitutes then a "neccessary" flight and whether we condone unlimited air travel for the wealthy.

2. oil at $100 would cripple emerging markets ..thus demand
829 2018-05-19 21:35:20 Sniff test and heat to steaming just to be sure. Expiration dates are a guideline for legal purposes.

834 2018-05-19 21:35:01 #satmat So Yongary is a metaphor for foreign Oil Dependence. Good to know

836 2018-05-19 21:34:54 The oil money buying the world
837 2018-05-19 21:34:53 $103 for an oil change 
838 2018-05-19 21:34:50 Sure they knew Trump with double prices for a barrel of oil screw the American people to line his own pockets
839 2018-05-19 21:34:48 So if we're making analogies, imagine if the reason coal jobs were going away was that someone 2500 miles away was dumping equally-dirty oil on the market, at far below cost, in order to drive competition from coal out of business. The energy/jobs debate would be very different
840 2018-05-19 21:34:44 Good night tweeps, I've an appointment at 9am on the bowling green, how times change, it used to be sunday morning football, hangover, some fukker farting (kebab chilli sauce)near your face while doing boots up, horse oil rub and ralgex filled the room, oh to be 17again!
841 2018-05-19 21:34:33 Super tasty: Korean rice.  Ingredients: worcestershire sauce, olive oil, olive oil, and raisin.
842 2018-05-19 21:34:31 Kept putting off getting an oil change and woke up too late today to drive solo and get to NJ from VA on time
843 2018-05-19 21:34:29 そんな感じ、お昼ご飯までは秩父にいようと思います。
844 2018-05-19 21:34:23 Hm gini. Aku malah yakin merk2 ini beli oil di luar trus tinggal packaging dan kasih merk hahaha ya soalnya sama semua variannya.

Aku pake purivera grapeseed+almond bagus buat mencegah jerawat.
845 2018-05-19 21:34:21 Not true but it’s okay to deflect your anger out on the world it’s part of maturing and growing up so one day you can learn not to be an ass
846 2018-05-19 21:34:16 I dream of a scene involving @Abella_Danger and @bratnasty91 will oil and a strap on with a single bag of Doritos in a corner and it would be in black n white filter to make it raunchy and fancy
847 2018-05-19 21:34:07 Might be better to just get oil and apply it to the tongue. :-) my 13 year old pug takes it that way
848 2018-05-19 21:34:05 Nah, you're just incapable of defending your points on their merits and need elitest distractions about how your magical metropolis has different rules and ethics. I'm callous to it at this point. Sell your snake oil elsewhere.
849 2018-05-19 21:34:03 Wise investors know that oil is on the way out and the future lies in renewables and green tech.
850 2018-05-19 21:33:54 Man he needs some castor oil
851 2018-05-19 21:33:54 I like oil of olay - has a nongreasy spf30 for daily wear - the yellow box one.
852 2018-05-19 21:33:51 Because I don't think that giving oil companies exactly what they want, exactly the way they want it, is in the country's best interest. Relatedly, I think that exporting dilbit is poor stewardship of our resource economy.
853 2018-05-19 21:33:51 Feeling stuck? Try making some art using oil pastels - consider the concept of enchantments in a magnified style.
854 2018-05-19 21:33:27 今日は秩父観光ですか？
855 2018-05-19 21:33:19 oil is not going to $100 ..
1. it is the futures market only..most grades are selling at a severe discount to futures prices 
2. oil at $100 would cripple emerging markets ..thus demand
856 2018-05-19 21:32:15 Hi Vaugn. How does oil get to Vancouver Island??
857 2018-05-19 21:32:13 4 new tires w/ an oil change & g a full tank feeling accomplished.

861 2018-05-19 21:31:35 True! Also, he never used cooking oil on his face
862 2018-05-19 21:31:19 why does a monster drink oil? where do you think the fire breath comes from? #satmat
863 2018-05-19 21:31:18 All the oil spilled out my vape pen 
864 2018-05-19 21:30:58 The government of Gambia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Mo'Nique in a cretonne wig.
865 2018-05-19 21:30:48 I think the natural next step for Di Maio to address monetary sovereignty and public debt is to launch a ICO Venezuela-style. They pegged Petro to their oil, can't DiMaioCoin be worth one slice of real pizza with yummy fungibile fresh mozzarella di bufala campana?
866 2018-05-19 21:30:21 おーはーよ！

869 2018-05-19 21:30:03 Definitely for BP's Deepwater Horizon spill, not only for the crude oil, but our formula would effectively metabolize the Corexit residuals (highly toxic) as well. Colorado incident I'd have to research/recall. Briefly, organic chemicals yes; heavy metals, PCBs, radionuclides no.
870 2018-05-19 21:29:43 Not when you can get a box of cookies or 3 bananas for the same price

873 2018-05-19 21:29:01 on td5's? there are 2 different heads for then coded 10p and 15p, i think the older 10p had issues with the heads going porous, i think they are interchangeable with some slight replumbing. Td5's also have an issue with the injector loom contaminating with oil and breaking up.
874 2018-05-19 21:29:00 Just keep those oil prices climbing Yellowman!
875 2018-05-19 21:28:55 Cool. If the Oilers get into the playoffs a couple years in a row, maybe I’ll give a shit again. I remember watching Oil Change 7 years ago and the Oilers still suck.
876 2018-05-19 21:28:35 Made an appointment at 9:30 for an oil change at @Midas.... still wasn’t done at 4:40. What’s the point of making an appointment?!
877 2018-05-19 21:28:25 I’m out of passion fruit scented oil so I put in vanilla but vanilla smells too sweet
878 2018-05-19 21:28:11 My dealer gave me a muffin this morning with CBD oil in it... I ain’t been the same

883 2018-05-19 21:27:17 What insanity and snake oil? I read his book and have no idea what you are on about
884 2018-05-19 21:27:12 Oil companys have missed future market. They should have moved slowly to sell miles / km instead of fuel. Now they are too late

891 2018-05-19 21:25:27 i thought my manic episode was ending but i just spent $40 on amazon for sunflower and coconut oil
892 2018-05-19 21:25:20 Brent Crude Steams Higher: Oil Sees 6th Weekly Gain, Tops $80
893 2018-05-19 21:25:17 Here we go again with that stupidity.  Are we running out of oil again??? Forgot that a few month ago we had way too much???
894 2018-05-19 21:25:08 Canadians are extremely gullible. We kept Harper in power for nine years despite his inability to get a single pipeline built to the west coast freeing Alberta oil. We foolishly thought Harper would overcome his lack of leadership and political savvy to get the job done
895 2018-05-19 21:25:05 Holla when ya ready muyi aure mu haifa twins
896 2018-05-19 21:25:05 Today walking to Brixton Hill we saw the local barber shop/braiding salon having an informal street party - bunting across the road - Soca blaring, oil drum bbq, iced carrot juice. I guess it really hit home how meaningful it is to have someone black in the royal family.
897 2018-05-19 21:24:54 It’s barely cooking with couscous! Veg: chop peppers, courgettes & red onion; drizzle with olive oil and mixed herbs; and stick in oven for 45-60 min. Couscous: tip into bowl; pour on boiling water; cover for 5 min then fluff with fork and add a little olive oil.
898 2018-05-19 21:24:41 I wanna be on the Mediterranean diet where you just eat olive oil and wine - @jordannn237
899 2018-05-19 21:24:08 Wonder how it feels to be a middle aged man and have a girl change your oil for you

908 2018-05-19 21:22:58 Absolutely - conspiracy to defraud our election in return for who knows how much $$$$ worth of sanction relief, financing for Kushner and Trump businesses since American banks will not loan them money - now trump paying Putin back by escalating tension in the gulf higher oil $$
909 2018-05-19 21:22:54 As solar and electric cars come on it will go away in five to ten years my guess... if oil prices,stay up will speed it up.... High oil prices is a good thing for solar and electric cars ..

911 2018-05-19 21:22:40 Been a long time since I fought him but the way I usually dealt with him was to parry his rolling/heavy attacks and throw oil urns+Molotov to burn through his hp.

Then music box for the free backstab and hit-&-run tactics when he commits to long combo strings.
912 2018-05-19 21:22:29 I literally have the worst skin, it's technically dry/combination but I struggle with makeup clinging to dry patches but also makeup just slides around my oil slick face 
913 2018-05-19 21:22:27 He's lied over 3000 times in his first year. He is selling you snake oil, and you like rubbing it all over yourself

The trading strategies of #US #Oil mentioned below may be confusing to some. It depends on each #WTI trader's trading style and goal. One size does not fit all.
916 2018-05-19 21:21:55 Mr. President immediately do away with the restrictions of using Natural Gas in Automobiles, Trucks it will lower our gas prices at the pump. While oil shale does put more oil in the pipeline it is not the kind of oil that is used for jet-fuel, gasoline, and other products

930 2018-05-19 21:19:46 Russian oil.
931 2018-05-19 21:19:44 Thank you. That is exactly the point that many people did not understand, in addition to higher revenue from natural gas exports, which is tied to oil prices.
932 2018-05-19 21:19:41 Especially when you rub oil on them.
933 2018-05-19 21:19:41 That vitamin e oil they sale at the beauty supply the same as the $20 vitamin e at department stores. Except is $8
934 2018-05-19 21:19:39 More like state protection of oil and gas barons. Not even a pretense at free speech any more.
935 2018-05-19 21:19:26 Good
My bro is also in oilfield working hard these days. Oil & gas needs much more attention and hard work
936 2018-05-19 21:19:23 Today on The Trumprano’s, The Don tweets a love note to Carmela, but mistakenly calls her Melanie; while Don Jr. is caught up in a new web of deceit with oil sheiks; as Rudy “Ralphie Cifaretto” Giuliani continues to spiral out of control yeling at @ChrisCuomo during an interview.
937 2018-05-19 21:19:18 When you are in horrendous pain and have no painkillers in the house but remember you have CBD oil and wonder if you could just drink the lot

941 2018-05-19 21:18:41 omg i've been getting so annoyed w my ears lately i started using bobby pins and my ear canals were deadass bruised and also DONT PUT TEA TREE OIL FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT PUT TEA TREE OIL
942 2018-05-19 21:18:19 The global oil prices have gone up over the first quarter of 2019, 

I hope this brings an end to the readymade, almost reflexive excuse political leaders give for their underperformance.
943 2018-05-19 21:18:11 But if love has any barriers just get a press injunction to stop the olive oil threesome wrestling rumours.
944 2018-05-19 21:18:08 Woke niggas getting exposed for stealing ppls crystals, sage, and coconut oil now. I done heard it all now 
945 2018-05-19 21:18:01 My Tio needs to get up & do this damn oil change
946 2018-05-19 21:17:56 Rising oil prices is essential for supporting the Russian economy so I suppose Putin may not tear up the deal with opec in June
947 2018-05-19 21:17:53 But GTO stands for? Gas Tires and Oil!!!
948 2018-05-19 21:17:42 IMO oil demand will start its decline in a few years and accelerate rapidly from this point. Any oil that is above the lowest quartile cost of production will be stranded. Tar sands and offshore oil will be among the first stranded assets.
949 2018-05-19 21:17:31 Big oil firms are changing their names to sound more politically correct and showing their commitment to diversity and renewable fuels.
950 2018-05-19 21:17:28 Look at proven oil reserves over time as we consume more. They increase because we find more.
The limit on how much we consume is never how much there is on earth, which is beyond our ability to even measure. It's how much time we dedicate to producing them vs other goods
951 2018-05-19 21:17:04 The problem of Nigeria is not really the price of oil.  Neither is it the exchange rate. The problems facing the country are “poverty” and an “exploding population”.
952 2018-05-19 21:17:03 put a tablespoon of olive oil on the pan med-high heat, flip them after a couple minutes, and then once the other side is done cooking pour in the sauce and mix em up! super crispy

982 2018-05-19 21:13:15 He is under pressure of worldwide oil companies.!!

985 2018-05-19 21:12:39 The Brent oil barrel near $80. Obviously it could be higher but it’s not an inventory problem. Meanwhile, The number of oil drilling rigs is rising. Some of the producers need urgently to increase foreign exchange reserves. Break even price of shale technology is lower...
986 2018-05-19 21:12:30 "Their offer wasn't even close!"
987 2018-05-19 21:12:15 Im basing my statement in the experience, not in some article. I'm vegan and I don't take any supplements ( expect b12)  the only thing you won't find on veggies is Omega 3. To assure that, you just need to consume a tea spoon of linseed oil everyday
988 2018-05-19 21:11:57 Well all I know is that I loved her as Olive Oil de Havilland in the movie. #MelanieTrump
989 2018-05-19 21:11:53 I took some CB//D oil in hopes of feeling better. I feel so incredibly sick but I need to press on and can’t crawl into my bed like I want to. I made an eye appointment to replace my 5yr old glasses script to hopefully ease the migraines
990 2018-05-19 21:11:46 The so-called low oil
991 2018-05-19 21:11:38 The primary goal of US Policy is as it always was and must be: the support of our Allies and promotion of US interests in a Region where 1/2 the world's oil is located.

Don't be fooled by Kremlin Propaganda. Only 14% of Russian bombs in Syria were dropped on ISIS.
992 2018-05-19 21:11:05 #Alton @PizzaExpress - Buffalo Mozzarella very disappointing. One basil leaf, one piece of mozzarella no larger than a ping-pong ball, and tiny un-ripe  tomatoes cut in half, with a little drizzle of olive oil & pesto 
993 2018-05-19 21:10:52 Why? Because U.S. foreign policy kept U.S. oil and gas production high, keeping oil prices low. Putin and the Saudis and UAE need oil prices high.
994 2018-05-19 21:10:48 Projecting it's end is surely not mere agitprop? If we aren't envisioning it, how do we accomplish it? Also, it seems intuitively logical that the more disruption we see to oil supply, the greater acceleration we'll see in alternative energy tech.
995 2018-05-19 21:10:46 Microbrewery tasting room! Put some rosemary essential oil in there, first, though.
996 2018-05-19 21:10:41 And you'd still have dealers under cutting and flogging to under aged. I'll go by the every day evidence of adults and teens I see completely ruined thanks, who can't give it up. Funny enough they all now have mental health issues. It's cannabis OIL that is medicinal.
997 2018-05-19 21:10:23 At some point you will realize that it's been innovation and market forces driving out coal. We also no longer use whale oil.

1008 2018-05-19 21:09:25 Io non ho mai usato grandi cose, ho 37 anni e una bella pelle mi pare. Struccarsi o con un sapone alla Bardana (erbolario) o con un detergente bifasico. Trucco poco, se puoi evitare primer e fondotinta meglio! Per idratare Bio Oil un paio di gocce, anche x le labbra
1009 2018-05-19 21:09:20 They don’t consider conservative women to be actual women. They never did. They didn’t celebrate my state getting its first female governor and senator in the past few years because they ran as Republicans.
1010 2018-05-19 21:09:01 @WhiteHouse Make all regulations have to prove they prevent life threatening issues, are doing what they were passed to do, have common sense risk/reward solutions for clean up if proven to be needed! Example Penn Grade Oil is non toxic and so is the brine Assoc with it.

1013 2018-05-19 21:08:28 She  thought it it was unjust that Exxon, Chevron and BP  controlled all the mining rights for oil drilling in Alaska and she took steps to stop it. I think that she was very good and very fair. Compared to Dick Cheney, she is a saint.

1063 2018-05-19 20:59:10 & you do know that in 2015 when the oil price collapsed Scottish GDP only fell by 1.1%. Oil is not the only thing inScotland.

1065 2018-05-19 20:58:57 Best oil news source I have watched so far.  In regards of technical analysis. I be live the oil dived after reaching the 73$ Mark and will continue to climb.
We have seen the sanctions on Iran imposed which will  cripple its production plus newly imposed sanctions on Venezuela
1066 2018-05-19 20:58:53 And if oil soars to over $100 per barrel will the prediction hold true - or will it be suddenly all good. Jobs created, house prices in ABZ spiralling - until the next crash.

Ive been heavily involved in the power generation industryfor 10 years. What do you know about?

How much will be required from renewables to displace oil? How soon can we do that?

1112 2018-05-19 20:51:31 Erik, I’m not a futures trader, but My data analyst take: oil to consolidate thru July with reduced volatility.  May 14, sudden shift implying this fall to be very volatile relative to current situation and also relative to 2019 and beyond.

I hope this will brings an end to the readymade, almost reflexive excuse political leaders give for their underperformance.
1117 2018-05-19 20:50:27 If you could return to a customer service desk in one of our Metro, Extra or Superstores but preferably the store attached to the petrol station you purchased the oil from, there they can correctly deal with the issue for you.

1118 2018-05-19 20:50:21 By 2040, there will be 200m EVs and 1.8 Billion internal combustion engine automobiles. Demand for oil now 100m bpd and will grow but not at the same pace. Petrochemical refineries is simply diversification but oil will be needed for many decades.
1119 2018-05-19 20:50:01 Whereas our decline into out of wedlock births and mass divorce started just as the Great Society took off and the US dollar was totally de-coupled from gold in 1971...causing the oil shock and a half century of stagnant wages and hidden inflation for the bottom 90%...


1120 2018-05-19 20:50:00 Me on a regular night: cleanse, tone, moisturize
Me when my girlfriend is coming over the next day: cleanse, exfoliate, mask, tone, serum, essence, moisturize, oil, rose water mist, blood of my enemies, saliva of jesus, angel tears
1121 2018-05-19 20:49:48 Russia has an enormous gini coefficient (ultra rich and very poor within the same country... ), next oil leg up will help...
1122 2018-05-19 20:49:42 They have been trying to add more land in AZ, NM, UT, NV & CO to oil/fracting leases since Feb 2017
1123 2018-05-19 20:49:35 I was so pissed last night that I came home and ate an entire load of bread and threw new potatoes and olive oil off of the balcony into the pool. Successful holiday... #sorryportugal
1124 2018-05-19 20:49:34 Oil is over $80 a barrel.
1125 2018-05-19 20:49:28 Judge how you will: my go-to snack today is to make rainbow popcorn with truffle oil and pink salt.  #lowkeyweekend
1126 2018-05-19 20:49:26 Funny also how oil prices have been steadily rising, helping them and Putin.

1128 2018-05-19 20:49:03 @YourHotWater911 I'm on east coast;local oil/gas co but closed S/S. Have new G6S4040PV w/Honeywell. Pilot light came on but went out shortly after. Hwh fit perfect easy install. Lit tho pilot won't relite tho will spark. Will reset controller work if it's circuit brain?
1129 2018-05-19 20:48:46 Also, I've noticed some people bashing him and @POTUS for not joining the #ArmedForces while simultaneously branding them as murderers, killers for oil, etc.
1130 2018-05-19 20:48:29 Asked if Polis is a threat to jobs in the energy industry, Polis says, "I'm willing to work with any industry to create jobs but not at the expense of public health and safety." Says "oil and gas industry is a cyclical industry." Not a way to build a reliable economy over time.
1131 2018-05-19 20:48:25 The global oil prices have gone up over the last quarter, I hope this will brings an end to the readymade, almost reflexive excuse political leaders give for their underperformance.
1132 2018-05-19 20:48:17 OIL FUCKING CLUB! SHENZHEN 
1133 2018-05-19 20:48:07 IT'S AWFUL, but, here we are.
1134 2018-05-19 20:48:07 Pretty sure one of my flat mates burned the HeCK out of his dinner because
1. The inexplicable fog
2. It smells like the time I almost burned down my house from over cooking beans and reducing a whole pot* of oil to just mere drops....

*it was a hefty, stew-sized pot.
1135 2018-05-19 20:48:05 My ex looked like olive oil
1136 2018-05-19 20:48:04 it's part of a litany and of course not the central point of the article - but i found it interesting and important and fundamentally correct that Ta-Nehisi Coates' definition of "white freedom" includes "freedom of oil"
1137 2018-05-19 20:47:46 Dude...keep digging that hole. 
First you want to ban rifles that a good majority of gun owners in your state own. 
Then you want oppose drilling for oil off our coast that will be a huge boost to our state's economy.  
Great decisions there buddy!
1138 2018-05-19 20:47:35 never gonna go n get my oil changed by myself again .

1140 2018-05-19 20:47:28 19 May 1970: #Syria closes its airspace to Saudi Airlines as dispute escalates over Syria's refusal to allow repair of the Trans-Arabian oil pipeline segment passing through Syrian territory.
1141 2018-05-19 20:47:20 You don’t need butter actually. Yeah use garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, parsley, and if you have any pasta water. And throw it all together and season. And add cheese 
1142 2018-05-19 20:47:20 “Huckstering snake oil pulpit talk ...it’s a mode of discourse and rhetorical style  I find endlessly refreshing...”

What a great line!
1143 2018-05-19 20:47:14 they say ya green not fire! ya white not oil! ya niggas ain’t loyal when you shining like foil
1144 2018-05-19 20:47:10 I'm not much of a recipes person - I do everything by eye (which is why I can't bake) - but spray oil... it just seems kind of gross. Although not for any obvious reason I can define.
1145 2018-05-19 20:46:55 教えるって難しいなー！
1146 2018-05-19 20:45:57 drinking mango juice + rubbing a coconut sugar scrub all over my body sound like a really good combination, & then soaking in a neroli essential oil bath w/chamomile flowers
1147 2018-05-19 20:45:57 育成ならそれで十分だと思います＾＾

1149 2018-05-19 20:45:35 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
1150 2018-05-19 20:45:35 I just can't get behind it. I'd like to see how much oil I've actually put in the pan, it's vital for some recipes.
1151 2018-05-19 20:45:25 Testors. I like the balsa ones with the paper wings you  put 'banana oil' dope on, a large rubber band for power. Good times, those.
1152 2018-05-19 20:45:12 Went to the gym, did laundry, cooked myself a good breakfast, did a hair mask, did a coffee & coconut oil body scrub... & took a glorious nap on freshly washed sheets after said body scrub. Productive self care Saturday if I do say so myself. 
1153 2018-05-19 20:44:54 Me: I’m not spending anymore money except on this oil change & my credit card bill.

Also me: “You are the highest bidder. You won! Pay now.” 
1154 2018-05-19 20:44:51 the most disgusting combination of words is baby oil
1155 2018-05-19 20:44:50 Because @chuckschumer warned/threatened @realDonaldTrump @POTUS  about the corrupt U.S. Intelligence Community - “...six ways from Sunday at getting back at you....” [Jan 3, 2017 *The Rachel Maddox Show*] He knew and knows as member of *The Gang of Eight.*

1157 2018-05-19 20:44:35 You can make a sauce with olive oil, pasta water, and herbs and lemon
1158 2018-05-19 20:44:29 Even if Canada moves along with the rest of the world, you're still implying that without fossil fuels to sell Canada will be seriously impoverished. Perhaps it's true that Canada wouldn't be much of place to live and work were it not for oil.
1159 2018-05-19 20:44:21 Warning from #Pakistan state #Oil !!!Due to increase in temperature in the coming days, please don't fill petrol to the maximum limit. It may cause explosion in the fuel tank. Please fill the tank about half and allow space for air.  Don't just read the message and stop plz share
1160 2018-05-19 20:44:17 I talk slick my words got baby oil on em
1161 2018-05-19 20:44:08 It is, if the oil hasn't been washed off completely, I caught it from a neighbor's cat once.
1162 2018-05-19 20:44:02 All with a need to raise the price of oil.
1163 2018-05-19 20:43:56 :c do you have butter? Garlic? Olive oil? Any herbs or cheese?
1164 2018-05-19 20:43:48 It's only May 19th and already ran out of #medicalcannabis #cannabis oil yesterday & i don't have anymore money to get more.

1166 2018-05-19 20:43:41 Oil at the highest price in years and going higher. Bum boy be a leader. Oh wait has never been.
1167 2018-05-19 20:43:13 Also, Joe, remember what the US/ British Empire did to the country of Iran in the 50’s. We sent in our CIA goons to overthrow the country in order seize the rights of its oil production plants. Again, foreign policy driven by oil profits.
1168 2018-05-19 20:43:13 The simplicity of God amazes me. By just a bath, leprosy disappeared. No drama, no anointing oil, just a Word!

1172 2018-05-19 20:42:55 I might not have my car back by 4.. I dropped it off to get my brakes done & an oil change
1173 2018-05-19 20:42:38 sounds about right - Olive Oil lube?
1174 2018-05-19 20:42:38 20% to the county govt!!! Means the 47 counties ama the county from which oil is extracted?
1175 2018-05-19 20:42:31 I don’t even remember getting an oil change in my explorer (don’t know how I didn’t total it that way) totaled my escape from not getting one(didn’t know you had too) sooooo where do I get one at on a Saturday so I don’t break this car
1176 2018-05-19 20:42:19 getting burned by an oil splash while frying something.
1177 2018-05-19 20:41:57 Supposedly the runnier the oil the better. I used to live with a doctor who had freakin' SPRAY oil (which is apparently the best kind) but fuck that.
1178 2018-05-19 20:41:55 Since oil/gas prices are skyrocketing due to renewed chaos in the Middle East you should push for coal burning cars and trucks.  It worked for trains in the 1800s, why try anything new or different?
1179 2018-05-19 20:41:52 Anyone notice how in military operations involving the Middle East, missiles will be sent over actual troops unless the targetted area is an oil reserve?
1180 2018-05-19 20:41:45 I can remember flying between 2 oil rigs off Pointe Noire at zero feet on an L382 many years ago #fatalbertrocks
1181 2018-05-19 20:41:35 I hear you. I prefer the rapeseed oil, but that might be because when I was at home my mother used that weird spray oil stuff and it put me right off.
1182 2018-05-19 20:40:46 Ask Molson to fill them with crude oil before delivery please.
1183 2018-05-19 20:40:32 I dont disagree with the saving face comment, but it helps the base being tougher on trade, will help farmers, and oil exports.  Bottom line is it’s over with and the markets can get past this now.  We have a surplus on investments so the deficit arguement was skewed anyway

1189 2018-05-19 20:40:02 I would like to believe that that the oil market is a structural bear, this counter market bull end soon... Since 2000 all the highs have been lower each cycle
1190 2018-05-19 20:40:00 How about some good fats in your daily diet? Cold pressed olive oil, seeds and nuts, avocado, and fish. How are you adding healthy fats?
1191 2018-05-19 20:40:00 Yeah, rape seed oil is cheaper, but it isn't as good for you. I used to get the cheapest oil because, hello, poor, whatever works. But even so, I made the switch a while ago to olive oil because it genuinely is a lot better for you (and tastes nicer IMO).
1192 2018-05-19 20:39:56 let me know when you find oil and then move to beverly hills. 
1193 2018-05-19 20:39:44 Now that the County Govt of Turkana will benefit from 25% resource allocation from oil proceeds, am I expecting a Kenyan dubai out there? @Josphatnanok1 @TurkanaCountyKE

1195 2018-05-19 20:39:12 Well at least they'll be able to boil a little oil to throw onto the oiks from the ramparts.
1196 2018-05-19 20:39:07 Every time I come to get an oil change, they always say I need something else
1197 2018-05-19 20:39:05 Mr President, America gas prices needs careful scrutiny since the prices have soar. Don't you think its time to start tackling such a prob? In Cali along we're paying close to 3.80 a gal in some places. Gas prices should be at least $1.70 a gal. Oil companies are killing us Sir.
1198 2018-05-19 20:39:05 Dont be stupid. The more you pay for a gallon of gas, the more taxes are collected. Why would the govt encourage the oil companies to drop prices. You're still gonna buy just as many gallons at higher prices. Cha-ching.
1199 2018-05-19 20:39:02 4 hours for a damn oil change, REALLY?!
1200 2018-05-19 20:38:39 I wonder how much oil it takes just to move it.  Move it! Move it!

1202 2018-05-19 20:38:17 I thought when I first remembered, it was bushes thrown overboard bc they did this to my family n I heard Barbara name mentioned. He was w mossad n they said they wanted to kill them n steal their titles n oil compnay
1203 2018-05-19 20:38:01 Palm oil avoidance is an absolute nightmare  it seems to be in everything!
1204 2018-05-19 20:37:48 Fuck oil field trash
1205 2018-05-19 20:37:37 Will be interesting to see the effect of a falling dollar on oil, and the narrative of opec changing. Only a matter of time before the president gets involved me 
1206 2018-05-19 20:37:32 because of the Agreed Framework.  At the time, I knew nothing about the AF, but the author was downright giddy about the economic benefits:  aid, food supply, heating oil, economic opportunities, and a new airport that would rival Incheon. I thought "what planet is he living on?"
1207 2018-05-19 20:37:29 if u have some oil n some spices n an oven u can roast it!! while it cooks you can go on your dumpster adventure

1209 2018-05-19 20:37:21 To imagine these guys almost bankrupted America when they demanded their gold reserves just before Chavez took over.  With so much oil production and oil on a rebound. What one will expect from a bus driver turned president.
1210 2018-05-19 20:37:03 huh, neat. Just round here there's a lot of rapeseed oil, because the crop grows all over the place, yet some people still swear by olive oil. I may have to look into it more. thank you though!

You need to research the country's raw materials. There's more than gold. There's Copper, coal, platinum, uranium, diamonds, oil, silver and LAB's sugarcane

1239 2018-05-19 20:31:47 Yup. Now imagine oil, antifreeze, f24, silicon, graphite and lithium assembly line and dextron.
1240 2018-05-19 20:31:43 With  all  due respect, I doubt they needed baby oil...a shine like that comes from the inside out.  #happy #healthy
1241 2018-05-19 20:31:31 That "common sense" thing should have been "nipped in the bud" but wasn't so now is trademarked by the left to mean what it isn't.  Snake oil and other "tonics" used to marketed that way.
1242 2018-05-19 20:31:07 I bought this Alize Luxury Oil for 4500  Now it better work on my scalp and healthy hair 
1243 2018-05-19 20:31:06 Genuine question: why is olive oil seen as the best of the best? Is it a marketing thing, or is there actually some merit to it?
1244 2018-05-19 20:31:00 right around the corner 10 years in the oil industry

1250 2018-05-19 20:29:28 Labour and the Greens are going to take your cars away!

Actually, climate change and oil depletion will do that. This government will awaken us to that reality, and start preparing us for it. But they should not expect gratitude, unfortunately.
1251 2018-05-19 20:29:13 UN = Owned by political Islam present day. Political Islam owns UN just as much if not more than the globalists atm. NWO & Globalists becoming controlled by political Islam (OIL $$$). Only politicians who can beat it are those not backed by globalists/Political Islam.

1255 2018-05-19 20:28:10 talking to a indy person the other day, and isnt SNP, never knew what the fuck it was.

Never knew about oil on clyde neither.

1256 2018-05-19 20:28:08 Cracker barrel, salt the water and add olive oil to the water, season your noodles add cheese, then a lil milk
1257 2018-05-19 20:28:01 I stir the mix in the glass and add some oil into it.

"Those are all things you don't need to know, little one."

I stand up and kiss the top of your head*

"Only thing that matters to me, is that you are here and you continue my legacy. You need to trust yourself, little one."
1258 2018-05-19 20:27:28 for all you guys that think EV's won't be a disruptive to the oil industry..I ask you..why are all the major oil players are hanging their future hats on petrochemicals refineries rather than gasoline refineries
1259 2018-05-19 20:27:27 U would say the same thing with oil money being thrown at you
1260 2018-05-19 20:27:27 You mean the ones with oil derricks or uranium strip mining?
1261 2018-05-19 20:27:18 1 tablespoon organic coconut oil, 1 tablespoon honey, 2 tablespoons brown sugar. Then you rub it on in circular motions and let sit for 10 minutes and wipe off with a warm wash cloth  literally my lips have never felt so smooth
1262 2018-05-19 20:27:15 Tea tree oil and whipped shea really helped with inflammation
1263 2018-05-19 20:27:13 Can someone give some castor oil to jaebeom 
1264 2018-05-19 20:27:00 Can you do something about #baleen oil too? The lamps on my street only burn that #whale #blubber
1265 2018-05-19 20:26:56 I don't know. But we need to figure out why whenever curruption is mention its always linked to oil and gas sector.
1266 2018-05-19 20:26:42 AND THEN ASK MANDINGO IF HE CAN OFFER UP HIS SERVICES THERE AFTER WITH SOME OLIVE OIL AND WONDER BREAD BAG TREATMENT ON THIS PIECE OF SHIT.
1267 2018-05-19 20:26:40 Use tea tree oil
1268 2018-05-19 20:26:26 I am now paying for all the oil and tanning when younger... My skin is so dry... I am also going to start wearing a sun hat your head you really don't think about until hair is so dry and damaged..
1269 2018-05-19 20:26:25 I need an oil change. I've been slacking
1270 2018-05-19 20:26:17 Adding fresh garlic? Minced holds up better in high heat than pressed. Use at least a TBS/15 ml olive oil. Red pepper flakes and/or rosemary are fun.
1271 2018-05-19 20:26:15 What’s even worse than the sycophantic royal adoration is some of the racism and xenophobia attached to the bride. Man can marry who he wants, regardless. And she’s beautiful so why wouldn’t he, especially as he’s no oil painting (nor am I before anyone comments!) Some people man
1272 2018-05-19 20:25:57 I play this game online with a very well off kind, funny man who works in oil. I kicked someone out of my alliance (don’t ask, it just makes me look like a dork) because he went on an anti-woman rant. Followed up with “you got your rights, same as the negroes.”
1273 2018-05-19 20:25:54 When I read the ‘snake oil salesman’ interview with this guys before EU Ref, I wondered if he was psychotic. Not my area but sounded weird.
1274 2018-05-19 20:25:27 Oh wow....how fab...so what was it used for as an essential oil????
1275 2018-05-19 20:25:12 Not homeopathic natural bullshit snake oil. Let me ask them. Also learning OBS scripting would give me S Q U A R E S.
1276 2018-05-19 20:25:10 80% is a raw deal given the fact that the oil was discovered by locals stolen by officials in energy ministry then sold to tallow oil.
1277 2018-05-19 20:24:59 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1278 2018-05-19 20:24:55 Oil lobby United; Koch brothers, Putin and Saudi-Arabia. Oil prices conveniently up 80% Y-on-Y to save the Russian economy and to support Saudi Aramco IPO. #Aramco
1279 2018-05-19 20:24:40 Getting my oil changed then #Deadpool and maybe squeeze in a haircut. #goodday

1282 2018-05-19 20:24:27 Shout out to cbd oil  actually helps my dog
1283 2018-05-19 20:24:26 Teaching one of my girls how to change oil on a lawnmower. I said “You should know how but hopefully your husband will never let you do this.”
Her reply, “One thing I’ve learned from men In my life is to never count on a man.”
#menhangyourheadsinshame #sosad #menriseup
1284 2018-05-19 20:24:18 @Tesco hi wondered if you can help me I purchased a bottle of oil from your garage and I haven’t opened it and it’s leaked all over the boot of my car it’s all over my coat what can I do I’m really not happy thanks Dani
1285 2018-05-19 20:24:18 The bottom line is it's more trade than we had going in and the markets will react positively.  Our oil exports are booming anyway so the deficit will be coming down on it's own.
1286 2018-05-19 20:24:13 @RBI you wanna know real reason for downfall in forex market. Due to crude oil and Venezuela offers India 30% discount on crude but with cryptocurrency rider. And what you did is stopping cryptocurrency. dont you use this opportunity rather being stubborn. #isupportcrypto
1287 2018-05-19 20:24:13 yoooo why did my grandma just put holy oil on my beat face
1288 2018-05-19 20:24:10 Is there any win that is not deserved?
1289 2018-05-19 20:23:54 @cheapyxo snake oil?
1290 2018-05-19 20:23:51 If One Finger Brought Oil - Things Fall Apart part Biafra24
1291 2018-05-19 20:23:49 It is universal obviously Good and Evil Lucifer is prevalent today what God will / Prevail Jesus Will Come and set things right thousand years of peace that would be nice no more Wars over possession such as oil who needs it electric cars will do we don't need to rely on foreign
1292 2018-05-19 20:23:39 Wonder how much Russians, Saudi's and other oil producing countries stand to make from killing of Iranian deal and run up in oil prices. While US consumers are paying close to a dollar more per gallon for gas. Sure makes that $1.76 per week tax cut come in handy
1293 2018-05-19 20:23:29 Got a much needed oil change!
1294 2018-05-19 20:23:22 Trita go and f your self u guys r finished, I am happy that Trump did this,, stopping this stupid unpopular government stealing the oil from good Iranians and giving it to the fanatic Muslims to ruin the life of other people.
1295 2018-05-19 20:23:22 Can @CNN be any dumber??  No wonder their ratings are dropping like lead raindrops.
1296 2018-05-19 20:23:06 Today turned out to be a long rest break & I'm not doing anything physical. My back is really hurting, so I took some #CBD oil & I'm waiting for it to take effect. So happy to have you in my life Mika. How is today? Are you feeling less #guilty?
1297 2018-05-19 20:22:58 Gonna use @MW_Breen's discount code "MarkBreenTheDiscountFeen" to get me some beard oil in Lush
1298 2018-05-19 20:22:49 "U.S.-backed efforts to strengthen and stabilize the local society" = occupying Syria's oil reserves
1299 2018-05-19 20:22:47 This is creation of shortsighted media which is looking at short term profits as corporates profits are still low but they only look at revaluation of asset prices like oil and interest rates which is creating volatility and data is misinterpreted as growth
1300 2018-05-19 20:22:42 Don't talk such crap. Coal, oil and all fossil fuels need to be phased out quickly. US will be fine as you can afford to fix mass flooding, hurricane damage etc. but many countries are already being impacted by climate change. And they are stuffed.
1301 2018-05-19 20:22:41 Don't mind the oil drilling....
1302 2018-05-19 20:22:29 @nubianbar should I use the oil of Morocco shampoo as well? (To wash the unit?)
1303 2018-05-19 20:22:21 Fact - that's complete bollocks. 

Once again for the oil addicts: not. Everyone. Is. Motivated. By. Money.
1304 2018-05-19 20:22:06 I did see they claim it's going to a special facility, but I say prove it. These oil companies are notorious for failing to clean up spills properly and I CERTAINLY don't trust them not to dump some of the sludge elsewhere, rather than pay to process it.
1305 2018-05-19 20:21:57 bio oil
1306 2018-05-19 20:21:48 It's a central question. Why would Putin want a POTUS that would make his country poorer? Hillary and the rest of you would shut down all domestic oil production, giving power back to OPEC, Putin and the rest of world's. You make common cause with Putin, not Trump
1307 2018-05-19 20:21:46 Our favourite oil
1308 2018-05-19 20:21:38 Ok but why when colouring do ppl draw bodies so shinny like are they just drenched in fucking oil or sweat like?????????? ?  ???? ???????? ?? ?????????????????? ? ? ? ?????? ?
1309 2018-05-19 20:21:35 And am happy I said it clearly enough for #sharpbrains and no members of PDP have moral justification to blame this government. With average  $100 per barrel of crude oil there's no excuses for corruption as allowed by the PDP government.
1310 2018-05-19 20:21:15 I used to distil tons of it for the essential oil and the smell sticks to your clothes like no other herb. I am not its greatest fan. I know some people hate it.
1311 2018-05-19 20:21:12 Talking about natural resources, Venezuela has the largest oil reserve in the world. However, we produce less oil than 20 years ago. Only 40% of the production is actually sold (to the US btw), the rest is given at discount to China and other socialist countries in the region.
1312 2018-05-19 20:21:03 So your pleased with Pruitt? With Zinke? With no decent healthcare despite the president telling us how easy it would be to fix, rising oil and gas prices, the growing isolationism? That all makes you happy? Well great, I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.
1313 2018-05-19 20:21:02 Big believer in essential oils - eucalyptus, peppermint, rosemary, lemon, oregano.  Diffused or applied topically (diluted with coconut oil) to chest and throat.  Mucinex DM Max is also good.  Good luck!

His resorts are in crime ridden third world countries too
Wonder why? #MoneyLaundering #HumanTrafficking
1322 2018-05-19 20:18:19 Simple answer to your question, exchange rate and current market price of crude oil. How hard is that? Can we just be reasonable sometimes.
1323 2018-05-19 20:18:18 Yes, steroid has motor oil transmission fluid. But I am lord Henry king wizard, dragon saliva is better and dragons breathe is more less
1324 2018-05-19 20:18:14 My sister advised me to steam my face with drops of tea tree oil now my face is burnt and all I’ll be getting from her is sorry 
1325 2018-05-19 20:17:58 Since last 2013? I guess we’ve amassed few. But yeah we don’t have the Russian collusion oil money sponsoring the club or a Qatari fund.
1326 2018-05-19 20:17:31 And big oil and big business, who can then buy off Fox News or oil Ryan. Who can then force an agenda on anyone who wants to be accepted within the party 
-value signaling. Like being against abortion to signal u r not into extra-marital sex
1327 2018-05-19 20:17:28 Are we going to find out they were all in on it?

I wish I could catch the bus to work
1333 2018-05-19 20:16:40 something, oil, gas?
1334 2018-05-19 20:16:20 They’re doing what Hillary did when she tried to hide Bill’s rapes
1335 2018-05-19 20:16:14 This Matt bitch always cryies like a baby whenever utd loses. Like now he sending the owners to hell for not investing, but I remember him downplaying the importance of Man City investment saying its oil money blah blah..but now, I bet he wishes Man u was run by that same oil.
1336 2018-05-19 20:16:10 let’s unpack this: the gov doesn’t decide what oil is extracted. oil companies do when it’s profitable. the tar sands oil is expensive to extract. don’t blame the gov on that.

your blame game is misdirected. 

1/2
1337 2018-05-19 20:16:00 And where are they taking it or dumping it next? That's my question. Someone needs to follow those trucks to find out where the sludge goes! The Blackfeet tribe has been terrorized enough by the oil industry, on top of everything else. Enough is enough! 
1338 2018-05-19 20:15:48 The idea that there is no tech in oil industry is laughable.
So is the notion that it is mature.
1339 2018-05-19 20:15:35 Can someone tell me why no one seems to care that gas prices are up? Paying more than $3/gallon. Thanks, Trump. Your oil country pals must be happy.
1340 2018-05-19 20:15:32 DID YOU KNOW??
If the Government discovers oil in your backyard they claim it's for the Government...buh when they find weed they say it's for you and you are going to jail for that..
Life is not fair at all
1341 2018-05-19 20:15:30 “Oil?”

I smile, chuckling before swatting your ass.

“Little ones don’t talk like that.”
1342 2018-05-19 20:15:28 Shots of olive oil (really gross but helps) no milk, tea and honey, and steam 
1343 2018-05-19 20:15:18 Ya they are a super reliable old unit. How's your oil temp hang in when your using the power brake? I overhauled one a couple years ago and we ended up sticking a secondary oil cooler in it and it really helped. The standard Jake's for those a blocks were kinda like a liberal.
1344 2018-05-19 20:14:45 Hurry up before we drill for OIL
1345 2018-05-19 20:14:34 Furthermore if we limit our oil use and encourage our global partners to act in unison to create a glut for 90-120 days we will be able to get Iran's economy almost on its knees. If they can't sell their oil they can't afford military, infrastructure agriculture.  A real solution
1346 2018-05-19 20:14:28 girlies some good skin care products:

- witch hazel
- tea tree oil 
- vitamin e oil
- rose water

these clear my skin, hydrate it and make her glowy 10/10 would recommend
1347 2018-05-19 20:14:01 Oil changed, might as well wash that bitch
1348 2018-05-19 20:13:58 It must be the hot sun or the pollution from all the fertilizer factories and oil refineries in the Texas that cause such officials to blame a school shooting on having "too many doors".  A new definition of idiot.
1349 2018-05-19 20:13:56 5 houses damaged badly, think it was a BBQ that set an oil tank up.

1353 2018-05-19 20:13:17 When electricity was invented people became discontent with oil lamps. And so our missionaries employ this sound business principle: Show the people something better and they’ll want it.

1356 2018-05-19 20:12:48 Y’know, if it were up to me, I’d never wear anything but coconut oil and long socks. And, like... comfortable shoes, cuz those are priceless.
1357 2018-05-19 20:12:47 Why are the @bcliberals so determine to destroy our fisheries & tourism economy to benefit their big donors. With "world leading standards" for ocean oil spill clean up at 10% of the spill - in perfect conditions, this is about #corruption & #negligence. #bcpoli.
1358 2018-05-19 20:12:21 So nobody want to talk about this #WhiteHouse is driving up oil prices? #cnn #hln #ABCNews #CBSNews #foxnewssunday #HuffPost #NYPost #WallStreet
1359 2018-05-19 20:12:05 So don’t build it! Hand all your oil related items in to recycling. Oh ya how do you tweet, or get to work orrrrr? Why do certain folks want and use oil as long as it’s not Canadian oil?
1360 2018-05-19 20:11:52 Now that the oil is in production, there is "support."

1363 2018-05-19 20:11:39 @KatyTurNBC 
Katy, would the 20 yr old Katy be proud of this Katy? you are taking so much money to help spread death, war and to literally hide climate change for oil companies. you are helping to kill the world. each of you in media has a responsibility and you are not living it
1364 2018-05-19 20:11:38 It’s never been about the evironment, it’s about blockading Canadian oil. Environmental activists are only useful idiots.
1365 2018-05-19 20:11:36 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
1366 2018-05-19 20:11:27 This Portland coffee is like...I can taste the bean oil like. Idk....if I'm into it...I gotta get paper filters...
1367 2018-05-19 20:11:07 So, what else is new? The whole "Arabian spring" "circle of chaos" was pretty well planned operation of disrupting peace in Near East. Somewhere is was caught and diverted like Egypt and Turkey, somewhere it went further like Lybia and Syria. And oil is at the bottom of it
1368 2018-05-19 20:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: soggy crust with fresh coconut oil and apple wood smoked bacon.
1369 2018-05-19 20:11:00 I just hot home from dialysis. I'm watching a playback of the wedding coverage. I've got half a cup of coffee, some small flour tortillas and a jar of olive oil with diced feta cheese and a mixture of ground spices. SO good!

1378 2018-05-19 20:09:26 I Dey wait make like 2 oil billionaires buy Like another two English clubs. E don end for dem be that. Lol
1379 2018-05-19 20:09:20 To undo the artificially high oil prices caused by Iran's political instability and threats of terroristic activities against Western interests, please activate ANWAR exporting more oil to create a temporary global glut. Best sanction against Regime and best benefit for economies
1380 2018-05-19 20:09:15 Well, that puts the over-the-top Saudi state visit, and moving the US Embassy in Israel, and coordinating fake strikes against Assad with Russia, and increasing oil prices, and decapitating the Iran nuclear agreement in persective, doesn’t it?
1381 2018-05-19 20:09:05 That one, Camille Rose’s Sweet Ginger Rinse, Curl’s Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, Palmer’s Olive Oil + Jamaican Black Castor oil shampoo, and African black soap for clarifying (and sometimes v05’s clarifying shampoo)

1388 2018-05-19 20:08:02 another 32 years in prison for one and a lifetime of guilty and hurt to family and friends. Mampintsha should be grateful that people are trying to help him get help and be a good lover than end up going down for a longtime. Victims of cooking oil burns have often gone to bail
1389 2018-05-19 20:07:59 its fucking 4AM & im frying (daing) cause im hungry & the oil has the audacity to pop & singe me and i said "fuck me" & thank baby jesus everyone's asleep
1390 2018-05-19 20:07:24 Yes. Keep em ignorant and love guns. It's easier to get them to join the armed forces. And then go invade other countries for their oil in the name of freedom.

1392 2018-05-19 20:06:52 Which #bigoil is quietly repositioning to attack #renewables hard - more than the feints by #BP #Shell #Repsol or #Total? Also, state owned oil majors enmesh #geopolitics of #oil  beyond #market dynamics, recall #Russian antipathy to beyond #fossilfuels. #ESG
1393 2018-05-19 20:06:42 So i watch a lot of vegan recipes on YouTube. This lady said some people are also oil free along with being vegan. Like howww what’s life if you can even have French fries
1394 2018-05-19 20:06:40 Not even close, for so many reasons. 1) battery tech far behind claims 2) have you checked EV sales data lately? Still only 1% of global auto sales 3) constraints still far outweigh accelerators. Death of the Oil Weapon is fatuous agitprop.
1395 2018-05-19 20:06:26 Every new day reveals what a disaster oil has been for nature, for humanity and for all life on the planet.
1396 2018-05-19 20:06:23 Look: fresh spinach, black olives, olive oil, mozzarella, ricotta, Parmesan on a yeasty pizza dough, cook it. Enjoy.
1397 2018-05-19 20:06:22 2 hours for an oil change well I guess I’m staying at wal mart for a while 
1398 2018-05-19 20:06:17 @LidlUK We were customers long before most (25 yrs), but sad to see the Continental delicacies disappear 1 by 1 to be replaced by generic stuff everyone sells. Gone are feta cheese in oil, big blocks of Emmental cheese and now Freshona Morello cherries in a jar to name a few. :-)

1400 2018-05-19 20:06:04 I'm not an oil guy, but I tend to think we could get a little blowoff which would be good to add to short side

1404 2018-05-19 20:05:29 During the @HofstraU Debate in 2016, Candidate Trump said that #NATO does NOT help with Terrorism, even though NATO has sent hundreds of thousands of troops to Afghanistan.

1410 2018-05-19 20:04:54 Use coconut oil, works a treat
1411 2018-05-19 20:04:50 Oh right, we can use your definition here.  BC will at one point in the near future, ban all shipment of heavy oil from its shores, based on, for one thing, grossly inadequate indemnification.

You guys don’t talk about that event though. But it’s definitely the Elephant in the room. In other words, a safe oil pipeline seems trivial to worry about.

1425 2018-05-19 20:03:17 @NatalieCadman26 somehow essential oil smells, ear plugs to block noise. Or project scenes on to calling, wall e.g fish, cars etc. Sorry I'm not that imaginative lol

Fabulous memories for you and your family.
1427 2018-05-19 20:03:11 @MichaelAvenatti Evidence indicates that @realDonaldTrump and his campaign associates brokered a massive oil privatization deal, where his Organization facilitated a global financial transaction to sell Russian Oil stock to its Syrian War adversary, the Emirate of Qatar.
1428 2018-05-19 20:03:05 I ran the front end for a major grocery. Invariably, 2 out of 3 food stamp users would have buggies full of junk. And they invariably were overweight. What that program doles out for a month of 1 adult and 2 children is about what I fed a family of 6 adults on.

1432 2018-05-19 20:02:07 Haha CAN'T trust them. Harsh, but time to get SERIOUS - cut off shipment. BC is very dependent on AB oil&fuel! They will "cross the floor" real quick & wake up. The pressure @jjhorgan will receive from the "majority" people will be #insurmountable. Just like Lougheed did in 80's.

1440 2018-05-19 20:00:44 He taught me how to change tires, check oil, how to kut grass, he basically taught me every fukkin thing 
1441 2018-05-19 20:00:38 Well to start off, Saudi Arabia has one of the highest standards on earth -- followed by #Malaysia and Turkey.  Funny, you wouldn't know that since you are so indoctrinated by #Islamophobic propaganda to believe "brutality and discord" are mainstream in Islam.
1442 2018-05-19 20:00:21 And no leg muscle apparently
1443 2018-05-19 20:00:17 Change your own oil
1444 2018-05-19 20:00:16 Guy har ka idar DA tarawee ko ka ware ne
1445 2018-05-19 20:00:10 The best course of action then is to avoid long grass, wash your tootsies after you’ve been outside, and your snoot/chops, ask mum to give you some apple cider vinegar in your water, turmeric in your noms and coconut oil moosages. That’s what my mum does.
1446 2018-05-19 19:59:59 She’ll oil up if her mom raised her right
1447 2018-05-19 19:59:47 @e_youshia hey, I’m a US veteran of the Iraq War and was looking to contact someone about the olive oil or date industry in Iraq. I hope you are well and thanks
1448 2018-05-19 19:59:25 See man that’s the ‘conservative /small govt’ issue. The programs needed/you suggest cost money but they don’t want to invest in USA ppl they want to privatize. Imagine if US GOVT owned it’s oil like Norway. Norway’s got a trillion$ oil profit fund. USA got trillions in debt.
1449 2018-05-19 19:59:18 United States: topples British hegemony and establishes its own through control of oil as the new standard energy source
Also United States: elects a president that thinks there is a war on coal that must be stopped
1450 2018-05-19 19:58:47  nice
1451 2018-05-19 19:58:18 Yes because I totally want to wait two fucking hours for an oil change when I can barely sit
1452 2018-05-19 19:58:17 Ffs.
1453 2018-05-19 19:57:48 Being an adult is reading avengers slash fic while waiting for your car's oil change and tire rotation to be done
1454 2018-05-19 19:57:42 So they can afford to do it??? Of course the baril of oil has gone up since Trump decided to help with his so bad deal with Iran...
1455 2018-05-19 19:56:41 Oil lga lu yaaa nahi

1457 2018-05-19 19:56:26 And they have a lot of oil
1458 2018-05-19 19:56:17 I would never make it an oil rig. Can you imagine the temperature?
1459 2018-05-19 19:56:02 No, that oil belongs to the whole country, this asinine politics.
1460 2018-05-19 19:55:53 This tea tree oil I added to this mask stings...I pray I don’t react to it .

China's EVs are simply coal powered cars.

1465 2018-05-19 19:55:13 Already weakening growth in Europe/LatAm, rising rates/oil will temper demand along ($3 gas will matter). US gasoline growth was already flat in 2017.

Growth peaked in 2017 as fiscal stimulus from China ($1T) & CB QE rolled out. My guess is demand fades with PMIs in 2018.
1466 2018-05-19 19:55:05 He’s reminds me a lot of Titus. Turning circle of an oil tanker. 
1467 2018-05-19 19:55:03 Yes 200 low paying unskilled jobs and you want to stop 150,000 highly paid highly educated jobs in the oil industry funny something seems wrong
1468 2018-05-19 19:54:57 Fear of blades is the only threat the oil responds to.
1469 2018-05-19 19:54:24 China has been getting oil as payment on loans , but haven't read of cash repayment of loans.
1470 2018-05-19 19:54:15 Coconut oil works miracles all over. Not bad for lips and it softens them. If you use it, you’ll just be applying it a few timed.
1471 2018-05-19 19:54:06 My sister’s dog takes CBD oil for his anxiety. It’s actually helped him a lot!
1472 2018-05-19 19:54:00 Really thought my aunt was border line a cult member for this oil stuff she sells.... then she put it on my ear and now I think I may join.
1473 2018-05-19 19:54:00 Heh Heh 
1474 2018-05-19 19:53:59 I am really flattered that i am your favorite, and i love chatting with people that watch my videos. And i actually ate too many noodles and also added some very old oil (i had no idea), and then boom had a horrific experience, one of the most painful.
1475 2018-05-19 19:53:35 I did, it was lovely, mixed with some chilli oil
1476 2018-05-19 19:53:35 No way have I just lathered myself in baby oil to take off old tan and IT DIDNT BLOODY WORK. I am the worst excuse for a lassie in the world :))
1477 2018-05-19 19:53:34 As I’m getting my oil changed, a middle-aged woman came storming into the Honda dealership yelling the “peanut butter jelly time” song. Respect.
1478 2018-05-19 19:53:34 Just cover it in some oil and you’re good to go 
1479 2018-05-19 19:53:29 What kind of CBD oil do you use? I tried some for pain and anxiety and it didn’t work. I would love to find some that works.
1480 2018-05-19 19:53:20 Good point on China vs US. Small batteries, PHEV, state-mandates, and lower range expectations.

Acceleration sure. Immaterial on demand through 2020. And ironically, might exacerbate future supply gap more as large offshore oil projects delayed due to EV fear
1481 2018-05-19 19:53:14 But before the oil fracking boom Saskatchewan received annual payments for decades. It helps to look at the big picture...  history is a bitch of a teacher.
1482 2018-05-19 19:53:13 I think some people who do keto use a lot of weird stuff in their diet to try to mimic their former ways of eating (nut oil and flour, etc). Not really sure how that modifies the diet
1483 2018-05-19 19:53:13 I cooked them in the oven with oil, though.
1484 2018-05-19 19:53:12 Everytime I get an oil change I end up waiting 3+ hours 
1485 2018-05-19 19:53:11 Luckily for their brilliant idea of pulling children out of school to protest guns, their brilliant idea of banning homeschool hasn't happened.
1486 2018-05-19 19:53:06 Yes renewables cleaner but sadly can only be 1/4 of any system as are unreliable, hydro too regional, solar doesn’t work at night, batteries too expensive. We still need 3/4 baseload, nuclear is clean but unfashionable, so must be thermal (gas/coal/oil)
1487 2018-05-19 19:52:46 On the overall, YouTube is harmful. 

CBD oil? Not so much.
1488 2018-05-19 19:52:40 LOL @ people freaking out because oil's at $80 a barrel. Oh, my sweet summer children.

1500 2018-05-19 19:50:46 my lungs started collapsing a lot in my thirties, but in my case its a dice roll of whether it was inhaling cs gas every day for two weeks or painting the interiior of closets with oil paint and demolishing lead/asbestos laden buldings.
1501 2018-05-19 19:50:32 kakdkaa I getcha!! colourpop doesnt play but oil usually works + makeup wipes but idk if you have those! also this might be common sense but just in case it's not you might want to wash your face in that area after the oil so it doesnt clog your pores!!
1502 2018-05-19 19:50:16 Hey, Mr. Monopoly, solar could use an extra kick with a federal rebate and incentives... we're kinda past paying the oil dudes big $$$
1503 2018-05-19 19:50:09 Like many people, I put the sermon on mute.  Not a fan of snake oil type 'preachers'.  And some decorum in a place where there are people buried would have been appropriate.
1504 2018-05-19 19:49:55 How is the state of development in oil producing areas of Nigeria?
1505 2018-05-19 19:49:45 Yes Otedola is a Billionaire in NGN terms, not so sure about USD, currently

I honestly don't find him as astute and inspiring

His wealth stemmed off our commonwealth & this barely impresses me

Zenon, diesel monopoly.... »»» forte oil...bleh

So tell me, what else?

1507 2018-05-19 19:49:41 GEJ Govt realised $540 billion dollars from sales of oil within 5 years with no capital projects. Buhari realised $56 Billion USD within 3 years and he is doing capital projects. No be money wey dey you go steal? You too check am now..

1513 2018-05-19 19:48:46 So @bcndp may buy #oilandgas from #America, oil & gas which may very well originate from #Alberta or perhaps Texas. One way or the other BC will be funding the USA instead of Canada by importing from #USA. So much for #supportlocal. Build the damn #pipeline! #bcpoli #abpoli #KMI
1514 2018-05-19 19:48:31 fine. But I’m still getting adjusted soon and rubbing lavendar oil on my feet when I’m sick (along with applying 50spf to my face when I’m in the sun and taking Tylenol PM if I get a fever).
1515 2018-05-19 19:48:17 Overestimated in US, under-appreciated in China. Equally meaningful for global demand. Also technology has advanced rapaidly over last 3y with low oil prices. Will accelerate in 2018.
1516 2018-05-19 19:48:11 It works better for me personally. Whenever I used oil after I never liked the look or feel of my foundation, even when I don’t wear makeup I feel better using oil first
1517 2018-05-19 19:48:08 @dpradhanbjp  sir, pls don't stop or reduce our crude oil imports from Iran even if US imposes sanctions on their crude oil,India has to stand up with Iran,our ally and long time trading partner.
1518 2018-05-19 19:48:05 These guys rigged the election to protect oil prices.
1519 2018-05-19 19:47:39 Also accept Whatever currency the remaining UK is necessitated to use  in buying our oil, water , electricity and    Foodstuffs.
1520 2018-05-19 19:47:15 You right. Pepe is fantasizing. He probably would have taken a bottle of baby oil, ripped off his shirt slathered himself, ran into the school, ALONE....taking down the shooter as he's firing his gun doing a baseball slide.

1525 2018-05-19 19:46:11 Canada’s trade surplus from crude oil exports is the basis of national prosperity. Anyone who wants to increase our oil imports, from the US or elsewhere, is not someone who cares about Canada, or about the environment.

1528 2018-05-19 19:45:48 There is no need for fracking,it drives oil prices down then becomes unprofitable as the opec countrys put more oil on the market. It has been proven to poison the ground water even a schoolchild knows if you poison the water you poison the ground you poison the world eventually
1529 2018-05-19 19:45:46 Oil change 
Hair cut 
1530 2018-05-19 19:45:46 So sad.  The Kock brothers et al flunkies hired to keep Alberta safe for Texas oil.
1531 2018-05-19 19:45:34 Give this man a bottle of....anointing oil.
1532 2018-05-19 19:45:23 Yup... we do too.  Please note the view had no mineral extraction, dying coal mining, oil wells or infrastructure, or a “emergency vehicle road” supplying trucks to a foreign fishing cannery.  Pretty hypocritical of you to post this. 
1533 2018-05-19 19:45:20 Change of plans for today.  After a slight rain delay, we are at Pearson Family Dentistry on Oil Well Rd.  New Flavors for today:  Pina Colada, Princess Cupcake, Cookie Dough, Strawberry Shortcake.
1534 2018-05-19 19:45:17 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1535 2018-05-19 19:44:53 It's not that simplistic. There are many factors that influence an economy, including many external factors, and there are many different ways to reduce a deficit. The deficit is already falling despite the dramatic fall in oil revenues. Oil revenues are now increasing - a bonus.
1536 2018-05-19 19:44:48 (Our oil for underappreciated faxes of copies's fiction unit will not die.)
1537 2018-05-19 19:44:46 Waiting to go back to work, So I can get my oil changed for free
1538 2018-05-19 19:44:45 you can use some kind of oil to remove it!! coconut is a good one!! + one time a colourpop lipstick stained my SINK for months tho I feel so muc h
1539 2018-05-19 19:44:41 case in point... Venezuela everything was all good at 100 dollar oil
1540 2018-05-19 19:44:38 Omg use your beach sandals. Then, buy a mosquito canopy for your bed.

When I live on Guam, we would fill coffee tins with oil or kerosene and put them under the bed posts. The bugs would climb the outside of the can, and get stuck in the fluid before they can climb the posts.
1541 2018-05-19 19:44:35 First moto of the Lucas Oil @ProMotocross AMA Champions drops in the next half hour. Hit me with your predictions.
1542 2018-05-19 19:44:32 Do you like Asian flavors? Mami los sazona en soy sauce, Brown sugar, ginger, crushed garlic, oyster sauce y un poco de sesame oil. Los cocinas a tu gusto.
1543 2018-05-19 19:44:26 Are you serious? Of course they are asking for money. Nothing else is relevant. Do you think they care about all the jobs your glorious oil companies are automating?
1544 2018-05-19 19:44:21 He is a climate change warrior who needs Putin’s oil money from Len for his campaign. There’s a copy of the wire transfer on Forbes with the source of funds.
1545 2018-05-19 19:44:20 Hey Marsha Trump is going to be your president fot the next 7years.
He told you liberals bend over and grab your ankles. 
Enjoy the ride honey.
Hahaha
1546 2018-05-19 19:44:14 I know you are a car guy, but beer that tastes like motor oil is a bridge too far for me
1547 2018-05-19 19:44:12 Where’s he buy his oil?
1548 2018-05-19 19:44:08 Exactly my point.. can’t just blame the oil
1549 2018-05-19 19:44:07 Stupid ass place that did my oil change didn't put down that I asked for an inspection.
1550 2018-05-19 19:44:03 then good news for all those canadians who rely on oil revenue because the price per barrel has been climbing. that should make those who profit, very happy. refinery profits are way up. 

can’t have your cake & eat it too. high oil prices = extra $ at the pump.

1555 2018-05-19 19:43:33 Russian oil companies costs are in RUB and revenues in dollar they must be killing it...
1556 2018-05-19 19:43:33 BBC Radio News the other day reported that Fracking in the USA was likely to drastically be reduced due to the rise in Oil Price, and their would be redundancies?

1558 2018-05-19 19:43:12 Jealous. That is the one thing I wanna make a stop in Vienna at some point. There’s this place where they fry a Wiener Schnitzel in three pans with different temperature oil, in 17 seconds total. I’ve seen it on TV! Seventeen seconds!
1559 2018-05-19 19:43:04 Pasty white!!! Dayummmmm!
1560 2018-05-19 19:42:45 It's only fair. Since they have hammered out a formula on oil from Turkana oilfields (Ha Ha Ha), we simply replicate it with other counties. Taita Taveta, it al should benefit from their minerals.
1561 2018-05-19 19:42:41 Bernie endorsed her.  

There was no lesser of two evils. That's just what you're told to think so that you justify the election of a pro-fracking pro-big oil pro-Wall Street pro-military industrial complex pro-intelligence agency pro-private prison anti-humanity puppet YET AGAIN
1562 2018-05-19 19:42:41 It was all tossed in a little chilli oil and it was bloody lovely
1563 2018-05-19 19:42:24 Many oil pipe line vsnderlizers and government treasury thieves lost their jobs and that is commendable
1564 2018-05-19 19:42:19 Why Oil prices dropped to £50? Deliberate deed by Saudis & USA in order to make cheaper 2 buy USA fracking Oil=& to damage Venezuela-Russia!
1565 2018-05-19 19:42:11 Shave with coconut oil 
1566 2018-05-19 19:42:09 Pretty Strand oil is something sick. It works magic!
1567 2018-05-19 19:42:08 Imagínense que “buena” estuvo mi noche que a las 2 fui al boliche, a las 3 estaba en la oil con mis amigas y a las 4:15 ya estaba acostada 
1568 2018-05-19 19:41:57 Oil change and tires rotated we ready
1569 2018-05-19 19:41:36 Yes many oil pipe line vanderlizers and government treasury thieves lost their jobs. That's commendable

1575 2018-05-19 19:40:19 I just got my tires rotated and oil changed and it feels like I have a new car again 
1576 2018-05-19 19:40:19 I used my credit card for the first time on an oil change and I feel like such an adult

Latest News Updates
1580 2018-05-19 19:40:00 We need to ask if there is some desperate panic on the realization that the entire oil sands industry will collapse, and Alberta and Canada for seven generations and more might be left with the massive cysts and polluted tailings ponds we caused Mother Earth.
1581 2018-05-19 19:39:58 Notice which years are above the curve and below the curve. Material increases in price of oil slows OECD demand growth. I’d suggest that roughly cuts OECD demand growth in half, leaving EM to grow as usual. I’ve penciled in 1.5 which is very doable at these prices if OPEC pumps
1582 2018-05-19 19:39:41 What is happening with fuel prices in Calgary? The highest prices ever while oil is only about 60% of high. Consumers being gouged!

1598 2018-05-19 19:36:21 I hear that crude oil prices are around $80/pb... Is it true? Is the reason for non performance...and borrowing like there's no tomorrow...still that they met empty treasury?
 I'm asking for a friend...
1599 2018-05-19 19:36:20 Yes! I personally use cbd oil for my anxiety and I’ll never choose anything else. It really does wonders. I say try it at least once and see

1603 2018-05-19 19:34:59 I gave my dad a drop of cbd oil. I told him it would help him with his shoulder pain. Sure enough, it worked and helped minimize his pain.
1604 2018-05-19 19:34:50 The bottom disk can rupture and oil splash will be contained in the duct.  A large fault will rupture both disks and oil may eject through the duct.  

The angle is probably to get the oil spraying away from the transformer so it can’t burn and heat it further.

1614 2018-05-19 19:32:59 That’s right: patients are not looking to get ”high” - in fact most patients only use a couple inhalations or a couple drops of cannabis oil and feel better, able to go about their daily activities with more focus, concentration and less distracted by pain & other symptoms

1628 2018-05-19 19:30:25 Vegetable oil. Cheese. Idk.
1629 2018-05-19 19:30:19 Shorty in Jiffy Lube had the short cut . Said she just shaved it last night. Must’ve known I was coming. Also, that oil change was high as sh*t.
1630 2018-05-19 19:29:51 How bout all the money you shared during the first  stage of oil boom, you wasted money meant for development of Nigeria in d name of helping a neighbor
1631 2018-05-19 19:29:11 I agree unfortunately. I keep thinking back to when gas would shoot up because oil was expensive for one reason or another. Then we'd hear reports that oil was back to normal but gas never went back down. Or at least not as low as it was before the increase.
1632 2018-05-19 19:29:02 Mix a bit of organic vitamin E oil as well 
1633 2018-05-19 19:28:56 I always put mine before and let it absorb then put my moisturizer. I’ve always hated the feeling of that oil after 
1634 2018-05-19 19:28:55 Me favorite line that old people use when they stop me to talk about my Jeep: “they just don’t make them like they used to”. Yeah, Bill, now those silly machines are reliable, can go over 60 mph, don’t leak oil all over the garage and aren’t bone jarring when you hit a speed bump
1635 2018-05-19 19:28:51 You can't even spell 'complementary' correctly. Wasting tax dollars on US oil billionaires. Shame on you and your traitorous NDP Cabinet!
1636 2018-05-19 19:28:50 Uhuru Kenyatta: "All clear for oil production, the revenue from oil will be shared on the basis of 75 percent for all Kenyans through the National Government, 20 percent to the county government and five percent will go to the local community." Kenya has now found a curse!

1640 2018-05-19 19:28:30 Is that the oil that was priced at $130 a barrel in the fantasy paper in 2014 when in reality iol in 2016 when indipendace wouldv'e happened was about $30?
1641 2018-05-19 19:28:29 you realize the prize of oil has leapt, and everyone on the planet is paying much more.

you’d best start blaming trump whose policies against iran have created this latest oil price surge.
1642 2018-05-19 19:28:09 There's plenty of oil and gas in Nigeria pet. The country is a hell-hole. Ring-fence it and let the locals sort themselves out.
1643 2018-05-19 19:27:57 I congratulate president Uhuru & Turkana leadership for negotiating a good deal on the Oil Revenue sharing.
1644 2018-05-19 19:27:44 You would rather have dirty oil from foreign despots. With tankers running up and down the st. Lawrence killing whales. What a joke.
1645 2018-05-19 19:27:40 This one is based on oil paintings I created in plein air at the Oakland Coliseum:)
1646 2018-05-19 19:27:39 Oil doesn't have the textural qualities of butter. I'm thinking an actual butter-based icing on a meatloaf?
1647 2018-05-19 19:27:34 To anyone who ever changes their own oil, make sure you don't mistake the transmission fluid drain plug for the oil pan plug.
1648 2018-05-19 19:27:25 Why should they reduce government revenue? And do you think the wonderful oil companies are going to lower the price 10 cents?  If you do you’re stunningly naive.
1649 2018-05-19 19:27:01 I’ve been mixing castor oil, coconut oil and argan oil and putting it on my brows at night... I think it’s working

1652 2018-05-19 19:26:20 No different than the 153 Billion spent subsidizing Walmart or McDonald's workers because those billionaire owners wont pay a living wage?? What about subsidizing Wall Street banks, or oil companies? #TheFixIsIn #BribesToPoliticians #TaxpayersGettingScrewed

1656 2018-05-19 19:25:00 This was a terrible bill. So glad it was voted down. We need a good farm bill that supports farmers but doesn’t put arbitrary requirements on families that need help. We don’t ask CEO’s of the oil industry to jump through hoops for their subsidies
1657 2018-05-19 19:24:47 Does this mean you will nationalize oil resources so that Canadians can more directly benefit from our own resources or will you continue to allow oil corps to reap all the benefits?
1658 2018-05-19 19:24:39 So slay queens what cooking oil was used to fry food at the Royal wedding?
1659 2018-05-19 19:24:33 What's being lost in this euphoria is the impact of oil prices which can throw us in a recession if allowed to continue. Prez can fix this easily by removing regulations on natural gas so it can replace oil as energy source.  Bush ignored high oil prices & the economy tanked.
1660 2018-05-19 19:24:22 I'll send you a set of 6 postcards of my favorite Oakland Oil Paintings:)

1662 2018-05-19 19:24:00 Day 50 : Once again night was okay. I think the CBD oil that I started to take really helps!

1668 2018-05-19 19:23:04 It could have been locked to the lifecycle of the technology’s dominance (treating oil as energy technology here) but eventually it would have been displaced as well. It would just have taken a lot longer in real terms.

1672 2018-05-19 19:22:14 あーや可愛くて美しくて基本夢寄りで見てるけど腐でも行けるというか可愛い。BLの概念を理解して自分は受けとか言っちゃうあーやが馬鹿で愛しい……でもあーやに嫁いるから最終的にどっちにも傾かない感じで単推ししてる
1673 2018-05-19 19:22:04 It's the low part of the engine where all the crap sits, and there's a plug (bolt) to drain off the oil.  

And that's oil I know about it!

1674 2018-05-19 19:21:51 Inflammatory arthritis of the spine here - CBD Oil has neat anti-inflammatory properties. I can only get hemp based (non THC) in TX, but it has helped amazing amounts.
1675 2018-05-19 19:21:50 As the world progresses to cleaner fuels like wind and solar-Trump drives the country progress back to appease donors/Coal workers could be trained in jobs that advance our country into the future/Jobs that won't jeopardize their health.  
What's next Pay to Play Don? whale oil?
1676 2018-05-19 19:21:48 Nigeria big for nothing . Small Kenya doing magic with tech . We need to copy copy like China to survive the next decade with future oil revenue drop . Tech and Agro be the way
1677 2018-05-19 19:21:40 Give baking a try! Could yield a similar (ie, not oil-fried) result. Baking tray, spray oil, 45 mins at 180.
1678 2018-05-19 19:21:38 Lol this is even funnier. 

The entire PMB campaign was built on building a Nigeria that is not oil dependent- yet you blame oil for non-performance? 

Clowns
1679 2018-05-19 19:21:32 The Iron Cross is not a 'Nazi' symbol guy. And you conveniently forgot to mention the obvious hammer and sickle, which is actually the antithesis of the swastika. Commies and the actual NSDP are like oil and water. Clearly shows yet again no one knows jack squat about the NSDP.

1684 2018-05-19 19:20:57 Sage advice from the oil change lady, "Saturday's are always busy. Not like a cup of tea but like an espresso. I could use one right now TBH."
1685 2018-05-19 19:20:55 With Trump, like Obama, turning a blind eye to China's island-building strategy, Beijing seeks to consolidate control in the South China Sea by warning that no one, without its permission, can explore for oil and gas there.
1686 2018-05-19 19:20:52 Yeah it’s pretty thick! I use the coconut oil more as a mask the night before I wash my hair-I just tie my hair up and let it soak in as I sleep. In summer though, if it’s particularly humid out, I’ll put some just on my ends to keep them tame
1687 2018-05-19 19:20:30 Since doing a tasting with @SabordeEspana in September in Montilla we only use extra virgin olive oil now.

1691 2018-05-19 19:20:19 Would change my oil but oh fuck no it’s too hot
1692 2018-05-19 19:20:01 Dear Mrs P was laughed out of Halfords when she went in to buy a longer dipstick as hers didn’t reach the oil 
1693 2018-05-19 19:19:58 @RepMoBrooks I just heard your remarks in committee from yesterday. Frankly, I am appalled that an elected member of Congress is so uninformed and incredibly stupid. The question is are you so stupid or just a pawn of the oil industry?
1694 2018-05-19 19:19:43 The Iran deal blow up was EXACTLY to make sure oil prices went up .....no one benefits more than Putin and Saudis.  He couldn't care less about nukes. Trump has a stake in Rosneft also.

Dovetails beautifully with the complete attack on the environment and ignoring clean energy.
1695 2018-05-19 19:19:40 I wish I could buy cookies from the store that weren't full of palm oil.
Nice crunchy ones.

I love soft ones too but I can make those. I don't have a crunchy choc chip recipe.

1698 2018-05-19 19:19:15 i followed the oil story close, at times our tankers have been discovered and the legal battle has likely end up costing more than what the tankers full of oil was worh.
1699 2018-05-19 19:19:15 because they are college professors doesn’t mean they are right. I think the 35,000 plus AIRMEN who lost their lives before D-Day bombing oil refineriesball bearing plantsGerman troops, would disagree with you. Suggest you do your own research and forget the college professors
1700 2018-05-19 19:19:10 Bet they think you’re a person of great standing here. Bet they think you’re a person of influence. A force to be reckoned with in the UK. How easily these Americans are fooled by charlatans and snake oil salesmen. I guess that’s how they ended up with that orange buffoon.
1701 2018-05-19 19:19:03 Ah, that’s probably the fryer then, I’d guess. Presumably the chicken is sticking to it due to the lack of oil? I’ve never used one, mind.

1708 2018-05-19 19:17:35 We even struggled to sell oil we had to on black market.  everything we do is on black market bc we are not a country yet and others wont deal w us. So we have been forced to sell low at a time when oil is all time low, n limited  in types of weapons we could buy at high price.
1709 2018-05-19 19:17:10 Ha! It’s only tinned mackerel in olive oil, then use the olive oil and add lemon for the dressing xx
1710 2018-05-19 19:16:42 I think it’s rather you are feeling better since you’ve checked the oil.
1711 2018-05-19 19:16:23 Insurance companies & home owners; send all the damage claims to the oil companies. Why should we pay for climate change carnage?
1712 2018-05-19 19:16:08 you got the oil?
1713 2018-05-19 19:16:01 You left abortions off that list I see.The last time I checked NOT 1 that I know and I have a family full of women go to Planned Parenthood 4 Mammograms! Thats like taking your car in for an oil change and they change the tires! That's not what women use PP for and you know it!
1714 2018-05-19 19:16:00 I mean........ so does America. We go to other countries a d attack them for not having a world bank, I mean for oil, I mean freedom, we are giving  them freedom.
1715 2018-05-19 19:16:00 @realDonaldTrump 

Go to alternative fuels, natural gas, ethanol, methanol...reduce foreign oil.

We need to lift all regulations that will put more jobs in the country.  
Obama n EPA restrictions n lobbyists are holding this alternative fuels widely available for automobiles
1716 2018-05-19 19:15:58 Just watched a commercial that said people thought a fake container of their companies lavender scented oil smelled more like lavender. Then they show you a tiny piece of lavender they have in the real container. 
Nice way to walk that line of truth and a lie.

1720 2018-05-19 19:15:12 ALERT ! Crude oil prices  produced by a corrupt Futures market & 5% margin on contracts. Only about 1% of 20+ million barrels/day US consumption from OPEC. ^ demand phony excuse & interest rising, US heading for Depression if this continues. present price costs 500 bil/yr BP

1722 2018-05-19 19:15:07 I can’t use any type of oil except on the very ends.  It winds up in my scalp even if it’s already dry. I can only use it in the shower between the shampoo and conditioner.

1725 2018-05-19 19:14:47 anyone who saw any online discussion of the leviathan oil field knows that halper commissioning papadopolous to write a paper about it could only mean halper wanted pap to write "the cia started the arab spring to stop gazprom from running a pipeline through syria"
1726 2018-05-19 19:14:44 Went to get my oil changed and they found a bird's nest. Also for some reason the lady next to me didn't have any oil in her car...
1727 2018-05-19 19:14:37 Exactly. There's no point trying to figure out the logic behind these kinds of right wing arguments; there is none. They're snake oil salesmen, performing for the marks.
1728 2018-05-19 19:14:33 I live by the beach. Come on out

1737 2018-05-19 19:12:47 I need therapy. I think this is the 3rd time in 7 years trading a car in on its 1st oil change. I stopped counting at 9 different cars the past 10 years.
1738 2018-05-19 19:12:46 they  were  so pissed  w/Obama  as it  lifted  Iran's  sanctions  &  Saudi  oil   prices   dropped  to like  $50  a  barrel..  1970's prices..  that's  main one. hmm  I  read   avbout this    way bedfore  trumpo came  along  to  run

Except it's not the same device we're talking about here.
1744 2018-05-19 19:12:12 It's the bit at the bottom of the cylinder block, where the oil should be
1745 2018-05-19 19:12:12 So @avis gave us a nice car that apparently was short on washer fluid and needed an oil change. Now we have to wait an hour for this lady to get off lunch to get a replacement car

1749 2018-05-19 19:11:44 Prez Trump seems oblivious to the pain at the pump & how it could sweep the economy into a recession to the very detriment of his agenda. He can quickly fix it by removing regulations on natural gas abundantly available that can replace  oil dependency.

1752 2018-05-19 19:11:23 Gun violence in America is like a car that is leaking oil. Rather than address the leak, we want to add more horsepower, slap a supercharger on it, weld everything but the driver door shut, close our eyes and head down the road. #santafe #enough #parkland

1762 2018-05-19 19:09:47 Wow! My normal approach is just a simple one: soak in buttermilk for 30 mins to a couple of hours, shake off excess, toss in a mix of plain flour and jerk seasoning, then pop straight into a pan of hot oil. Or sometimes I just spray with oil and then bake it.

1776 2018-05-19 19:08:10 Chief, N87 to N145 is 67% not 40%. Secondly oil marketers are buying USD at CBN rate of N305 so that is N197 to N305 - 52%. That completely kills your argument. Finally Oil price was $100 then, now it just rose to $80, can you please find a better defense for this subsidy fraud

1790 2018-05-19 19:05:41 There are oil spills on a daily basis, killing animals. There are yrs of conflicts, wars in the Middle East rooted in oil. I read the article. 60% of cobalt from Congo, 20% done by hands & probably w children. 4.5 kgx0.6x0.2=0.5 kg vs 1000s of gallons & yrs of oil consumption.

1795 2018-05-19 19:04:39 They did give me 3 free tire rotations and 3 free oil changes. Thank you but come on pull your head out of your ass. I was there for the most basic things and that can’t be accomplished without my asking. I’d probably still be sitting there. Thank for for vodka

1797 2018-05-19 19:04:18 Aphids are easy to remove, just tend to keep coming back. They seem to love beans and corn. I've never seen them on herbs. I squirt some of my "crops" daily with water to remove them,  also mix neem oil and water and spray. Ants "farm" aphids, sometimes getting rid of ants helps.
1798 2018-05-19 19:04:05 We're out of the Iran deal so *45 can start a war and grab their oil.

1803 2018-05-19 19:03:44 Trouble is we need to replace them with politicians who will actually work to fix those problems. Dems owned Congress and the White House and did nothing about gun control. And they acknowledge climate change but push fracking and opened the Arctic to oil drilling.

1820 2018-05-19 19:00:48 I believe it! Yesterday I had a 3:00 oil change tire rotation appointment. After an hour I went to check on the status. Some dumb fuck parked it in the lot and there it sat until I asked what’s the status. Last time it was worse than that

1841 2018-05-19 18:58:40 Did you read the report? The report hints that the number of unemployed youths is greater than the one record 3 years earlier. There are many factors responsible. 1.

1869 2018-05-19 18:53:41 Wat’s your point? See that line between Canadian and US territory? If an oil spill on the US side, that line will stop spilled oil from crossing to Canadian side. U haven’t been paying attention to quality human beings like John Horgan and Tzeporah Berman? They know all. #cdnpoli

1873 2018-05-19 18:53:08 Shingles are a painful thing. Tea Tree Oil is very effective for healing and helps in relief and treatment if applied and covered or ingested. Also Oatmeal either applied as paste, in baths or by ingestion. I have personal seen these to work.

1953 2018-05-19 18:42:49 Tee tree oil
1954 2018-05-19 18:42:46 Try it without palm oil. 
If you have dried okporo, blend the head and add to the mix. Substitute efirin for Uziza sometimes.

1957 2018-05-19 18:41:39 I didn't model oil at $80 tho -- will make the (mismeasured, b/ c of tourism) headline current account balance a closer call
1958 2018-05-19 18:41:26 I’m used to paying $30 or less for an oil change.. this damn car takes synthetic & whatever quarts & they talkin bout $85. Is that normal? lol wtf
1959 2018-05-19 18:41:21 The Irish have solved the problem with their economy. They have imported 50 million tonnes of sand from the Arabs and they're now going to drill for their own oil.

1963 2018-05-19 18:41:00 This 75% for all Kenyans is a big lie. We know the bigwigs will even siphon the oil from the wells, let alone cash
1964 2018-05-19 18:40:52 @pulpmx @PaulPerebijnos I need some technical help; is there anything wrong with using gas mixed with oil A one day, then using gas mixed with oil B the next?

1966 2018-05-19 18:40:44 I don’t use ranch. Mainly olive oil or vinegar. It’s the healthiest choice
1967 2018-05-19 18:40:38 One important point you miss is, there is NO requirement that legally binds LE to protect the individual or his property. SCOTUS has ruled.

1971 2018-05-19 18:39:59 I went to get a pedicure and they massaged my feet with oil after the nail polish application. I agreed to this while forgetting id have to run across the street to my car that was getting cleaned...

1973 2018-05-19 18:39:39 You have the right to air your views, what you don't have right to is to air IGNORANT views. NOI's mum was kidnapped BECAUSE NOI was dealing with oil marketers' scam. Read her book. If you think her book is one sided, find out from the Police who investigated the matter.

1975 2018-05-19 18:39:24 One of Trump's first moves was to reverse the #ParisAgreement. Brent #oil has 6 weeks of gains. There's the #Venezuela sanctions, Iran and #OPEC trimming output. So, Trump's presidency clearly is, in-part, a backlash by #energy oligarchs and states to progress on climate policy.
1976 2018-05-19 18:39:14 Took my car to get a front end alignment & oil change I’ve spent atleast $160 on just that

1981 2018-05-19 18:38:27 How about taking climate change seriously and banning palm oil. Good start.
1982 2018-05-19 18:38:26 BREAKING NI NEWS : ( 1 of 2 ) NIFRS are dealing with a major Fire in #Ballyduff #Glengormley.  Up to five houses and three oil tanks are alight with risk of the fire spreading to other properties.
1983 2018-05-19 18:38:18 So which sect of Islam is superior? How long oil money will continue? Who have more internal structural problems, we or they? Europe will not remain  Christian but India will become one. Where these super intelligent people come from?

1998 2018-05-19 18:36:19 We get plenty of petroleum from Mexico, Canada, and Venezuela. Rising gas prices with the excuse of the Middle East(Iran, Saudi Arabia) is just another money grab by Big Oil.

2009 2018-05-19 18:35:12 @GovernorNanok you're a sellout to your community. How do you agree to take larger share of oil exploration and least to your people? You're an embarrassment!
2010 2018-05-19 18:35:12 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
2011 2018-05-19 18:35:02 I heard Thatcher gave a way ceretain oil fields to the Americans. And now you are grabbing our powers....we probably will have to take American chlorinated chicken and Gmail crops to. But I suppose to you that doesn't matter. Because in a historical context we are all blameless
2012 2018-05-19 18:34:49 Oil change 
2013 2018-05-19 18:34:46 Anyway, you can just leave it at the bottom of the ocean, doesn't do much damage. Oil gets all up in bird feathers and wrecks the beach and whatnot. What is your point exactly?
2014 2018-05-19 18:34:31 Maybe it’s time to just give up and put extra cheese and mayo on his Big Macs and deep fry his FF with extra trans fat oil and hope that nature takes its course, soon.

2020 2018-05-19 18:34:05 This is the more reason why we need to part ways bcos our value system, culture, food, mode of dressing, religion and many others are not the same.

2021 2018-05-19 18:34:01 Why would you oil your feet and flip flops?
2022 2018-05-19 18:33:37 This is a synchronized, annual event, held globally to advocate for increased protection for the ocean and to protest offshore drilling. People are very passionate for this cause, in light of the after effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

2026 2018-05-19 18:33:02 20% of the Turkana oil revenue will go to the county govt of Turkana. Hope the deal struck between the national government and the county govt of Turkana will be honoured this time round. Failure to, Turkana oil might be a time bomb waiting to explode.

2030 2018-05-19 18:31:51 I mean if it's blazing and you're putting on baby oil as opposed to sun screen than we might have a chat.
2031 2018-05-19 18:31:47 Putin likes the high oil prices. MAGAvoters played right into his longterm goals to divide US culture & drain its export economy.
2032 2018-05-19 18:31:33 That Israel was created as a way to protect British and American oil interests in the middle east is indisputable. But go ahead pretend it was legal
2033 2018-05-19 18:31:14 It’s usually “yellow” and may even have the word “oil” imprinted on the top. When you pull it out wipe it downward with a clean paper towel. Then reinsert, pull out again and read. Always check when the car’s ignition is off.
2034 2018-05-19 18:30:57 you’re giving others too much power as you even acknowledge how they make you feel. What you’ve got to decide is how I’m going to feel. We would go to a Virtual Reality and we would practice feeling good. Manifestations come on the heels of what you’ve conjured in thought.
2035 2018-05-19 18:30:43 I think it is false to assume that this is about nukes. It was a favor to Kushner, whose family has been tight with Netanyahu for a long time. And this is a slam dunk for Russia, w/ the barrel of oil above 80 again the rubles spill and many issues Putin has are easier to manage.
2036 2018-05-19 18:30:39 Why’s everybody drinking palm oil in bamenda though  what are my village people up to this time? #cameroon #cameroun #bamenda
2037 2018-05-19 18:30:36 Looks good, mate. I like raw tomato with fresh mozzarella, oil, oregano and sea salt on mine
2038 2018-05-19 18:30:34 I feel similar in regards to Conte. Had he had control over transfers I'm sure we wouldn't be signing the likes of Drinkwater when he wanted Vidal. Or Emerson when he wanted Sandro. Just a shame him and the board are like oil and water.
2039 2018-05-19 18:30:18 Several million of these rifles. Only a few dozen used. In this case, VA Tech not used and no proposed law would have prevented most.

2041 2018-05-19 18:30:14 You sold the oil fields....giving it to anyone but us. You took the BP headquarters from Glasgow to London. The atrocities go on
2042 2018-05-19 18:30:12 Would you take medical advice from the person that changes your oil?  That's what it is like listening to people who know nothing about guns telling us what common sense is.

2044 2018-05-19 18:30:01 Some mayo or salad cream. Leave it on it for a bit. The vinegar helps dissolve the glue and the oil soaks in and loosens the residue. Works with stickers on windows so worth a try
2045 2018-05-19 18:29:53 Ahead the mists parted to reveal a path of wooden, here we traded our cod-liver oil for maps.

2049 2018-05-19 18:29:18 Also I'd like to take a moment to also say Jamie Oliver is a fat piece of healthy shit. Man promotes healthy eating but is growing into a whale with his olive oil factory
2050 2018-05-19 18:29:09 And given petrol and utilities prices come down less than the actual price of oil or gas in "normal" circumstances when it fluctuates, then the supermarket or oil companies are not likely to pass that saving on anyhow...
2051 2018-05-19 18:28:54 Please take nesesary actions to reduce oil prices

2063 2018-05-19 18:27:16 The British took Jerusalem because they got to decide the terms after ww1 and they needed some modicum of gains for millions dead. And then did nothing with it because middle east was backwaters at the time. Oil wasn't important until WW2 and after. When they went in with guns.
2064 2018-05-19 18:27:10 If African countries weren’t so corrupt and plagued by rogue militias they’d be one of the biggest economies in the world. Multiple African countries sit on mass oil reserves and precious metals that are exploited by 1st world countries.

2071 2018-05-19 18:25:41 USA has been moving towards energy independence since 1979. It reached its peak in 2016 with 92% self sufficiency. Increased energy supply through fracking is the  dominant factor but US still imports oil from Middle East. None of this has anything to do with Trump.
2072 2018-05-19 18:25:32 This is correct. No reason for oil to be over $50 to $60 a barrel
2073 2018-05-19 18:25:23 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

2084 2018-05-19 18:23:44 Not exactly light snow. If our oil doesn't make it to market then other oil will fill the demand without Canada's world class environmental regulations.

2094 2018-05-19 18:21:58 Why bother scheduling an appointment when they still take 3 hours to do an oil change??

2096 2018-05-19 18:21:46 จิง ได้ถ้วยนี้เพื่อเป้งกำลังใจให้นักแตะและแฟนบอล แต่ปีนี้เพลียมาก จบฤดูกาลนี้น่าจะต้องยกเครื่องใหม่หมด คนเชียร์นี้เหนื่อยพอๆกับนักเตะเลยอ่ะ
2097 2018-05-19 18:21:44 Ouch that does look very sore, poor boy . Bio oil is good at preventing scaring but not till it’s healed over . He is v young so scarring should be minimal. Best medicine is extra mum cuddles x
2098 2018-05-19 18:21:35 And where's the price of crude oil today compared to its price two years ago?
2099 2018-05-19 18:21:32 Skip the messy and dangerous oil and get a baffle. They're cheap or easy to make. But this is funny.
2100 2018-05-19 18:21:28 How about the decimated oil industry and severe unemployment that ensued because of the war on oil. Yeah that really sucked.
2101 2018-05-19 18:21:14 Is there no oil in middle east where Britain and America would like an arm for their interests and military ?
Are you purposefully dense and ignorant or just accidentally?
2102 2018-05-19 18:20:49 In return trump gave Jerusalem to Israel by placing the US embassy (no wonder he refused to take the un advice) and Russia they get no sanctions and economic stability and growth for meddling (china tariffs tripled Russian soybean sales iran deal ending more oil sales in russia)
2103 2018-05-19 18:20:44 Gun Oil Force Recon 100 ml Silikon Gleitmittel Gleitgel Gel |11...
2104 2018-05-19 18:20:43 There’s a drunk man trying to fight the workers changing my oil tell me bout it sis 
2105 2018-05-19 18:20:39 Yeah, oil and water, slick and crisp.
2106 2018-05-19 18:20:27 Remember reading how low dose tea tree oil  in health and beauty products was adding to this....
2107 2018-05-19 18:20:25 My nigga . You gotta mix the Doo Gro in a spray bottle with some water and hit yo hair up throughout the day. But use the Island oil like once a day, so do that one first
2108 2018-05-19 18:20:22 I think taxpayers support of a profitable public oil company #KinderMorgan suggests the end of modern economic thinking in Canada and cements the country in an emerging market status.
2109 2018-05-19 18:20:21 Hes a snake oil salesman, his opinion really shouldn't mean much
2110 2018-05-19 18:19:45 Gremolata....herbs. oil, stuff
2111 2018-05-19 18:19:39 I'm trying to cut out products containing palm oil. Top result is a Sanex product from @BootsUK - trouble is Sanex contains palm oil...

If anyone can recommend any products that don't contain palm oil I'd be very grateful.
2112 2018-05-19 18:19:36 Trump bombed a airstrip that was cleared of military planes. He pulled out of the Iran deal and its caused Russian oil to increase in value and gas goes up in US as well. Why do you think he won’t implement the sanctions and lied about his business dealings? 
2113 2018-05-19 18:19:26 The "partisan" party is the one backed by the Koch brothers and Big business. It is the party that wishes to ignore an attack against our country and its democracy. Remember the Republican"War for Oil"and financial depression? Far right conservatism is TOTALITARIAN rule.
2114 2018-05-19 18:19:10 Oil G I love ya
2115 2018-05-19 18:19:05 Oh I'd be out there everyday with only factor 2 oil on. I used to live in California and Texas. Why I live here is a question that often visits me. At 3 in the morning
2116 2018-05-19 18:18:59 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
2117 2018-05-19 18:18:57 Oil field niggas act like they illuminati 
2118 2018-05-19 18:18:53 That’s what Oil money does for you
2119 2018-05-19 18:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
2120 2018-05-19 18:18:39 #MeeKoahcheh Axe Oil
2121 2018-05-19 18:18:26 Oh my GOD this woman on my train is preaching about how antibiotics & medicine are myths and makeup gives us cancer, and her toddler just whacked her miracle cure francinsense oil IN HER OWN EYE and started screaming I’m dead hahahahahaha
2122 2018-05-19 18:18:24 I can stitch a laceration but I can’t find the oil thingy....
2123 2018-05-19 18:18:23 Getting an oil change and forgot my headphones. And there’s two crying kids in here. 
2124 2018-05-19 18:18:21 That's geopolitical bullshit-Saddam because of oil and Gaddafi because they thought they would get a western-friendly govt. Remember that the Vatican opposed the Iraq war
2125 2018-05-19 18:18:08 I’ve tried that and it still doesn’t work. I’ve tried coconut oil too 
2126 2018-05-19 18:17:55 *Since oil money
2127 2018-05-19 18:17:40 Weak leaders like Yeddy trying to cash in on non-issues such as Lingayat religion without offering progress or leadership to people & supporting undemocratic forces from outside financed by black&oil money got a strong e response from people
2128 2018-05-19 18:17:31 Trailers on semi trucks on tne world highways travel vast distances across continents should  be hauled aboard trains to destinations where local hook up could deliver.Would save wages,polution,highways wear,gasoline,oil,time and envigorate railways. Many pluses!!!
2129 2018-05-19 18:17:23 FWIW, I am a functional medicine provider who is THRILLED we at least have medical legal access in my state finally.  But for pain like that, you might try a concentrated CBD oil versus the whole plant.
2130 2018-05-19 18:17:18 And this appears in the first minutes to be advocating Keynesian economics.

I am curious to see how they explain Latin American economic history and 1970s American history. Especially as we will likely run out of fracked oil before sustainable energy is widely available.
2131 2018-05-19 18:17:17 กูว่างที่นี่เพิ่ง11โมงน่านะคิดดูอีกที
2132 2018-05-19 18:17:15 Oil change places always make me feel so comfortable with being straight up dumb about some features on my car. Thank you 
2133 2018-05-19 18:16:59 That was an incredibly long day of playing. I’m at about lvl 18 for all characters and in the second sandsea desert after the oil rigs on my way to a tomb… #ffxii
2134 2018-05-19 18:16:47 Bought some vaping oil today. Asked for some tobacco tasting ones and the bloke in the shop suggested I try one that tasted of 'Lambert & Butler'.

I couldnt imagine it personally but yes, I can confirm, top scientists have successfully chemically re-created Lambert & Butler fags
2135 2018-05-19 18:16:44 I don't trust our oil companies either. They are scamming us. There is no reason for gas prices to be this high.
2136 2018-05-19 18:16:36 If @fordnation wins the election the longest part of the Energy East pipeline can be built. From Alberta to the Quebec border. Once all these Provinces reap the benefits of cheaper Canadian oil Quebec and the East will be begging to join the project. Then we negotiate @fordnation
2137 2018-05-19 18:16:34 Europa League in last season, isn't it?
2138 2018-05-19 18:16:22 you should promote olive oil and bulgur together but now maras pepper.
2139 2018-05-19 18:15:50 เป็นซีซั่นที่ไม่ค่อยดีแต่อย่างน้อยก็ยังไม่มือเปล่า พอใจแล้วค่า
2140 2018-05-19 18:15:45 nobody looks stupid RN than a utd fan who barked oil money
2141 2018-05-19 18:15:30 @VinnieTortorich according to @JillianMichaels the PR I set on the #crankthekanc2018 tt hillclimb course didn’t happen because it did it without carbs. It was all #NSNG fueled - h2o, mct oil, macadamia nuts, gf summer sausage, eggs, avocado, bacon & hwc. Should be on knees right?
2142 2018-05-19 18:15:28 Tillerson stuck on an Arctic icebreaker with Putin & a frozen oil contract.

2146 2018-05-19 18:15:07 The cleansing, healing oil of the Holy Spirit is applied to our hearts when we are hurt or wounded.
2147 2018-05-19 18:14:59 Lol good coconut oil it's not totka in USA it is used to cure Alzheimer
2148 2018-05-19 18:14:49 Sources say that Republicans allowed oil drilling in millions of young Obama appointees while you were distracted by Trump's tweets.
2149 2018-05-19 18:14:46 thanks @conocophillips without fuell no electricity" Forgot to thank MADURO !! He's in the process of sending you free oil, gas, gasoline and electricity (internet is being considered...), just like he does with CUBA... Such a nice guy...
2150 2018-05-19 18:14:42 Mourinho is the Architect of @ManUtd misfortune
2151 2018-05-19 18:14:41 You do realize, we can't use coal to fuel our cars and fossil fuels like oil won't last forever? Not to mention, there is no such thing as "clean coal". That's like a cigarette company saying we stopped selling cigarettes and now we sell clean cigarettes. Both still give Cancer
2152 2018-05-19 18:14:35 Hot oil treatment for the hair, oh yes 
2153 2018-05-19 18:14:33 I swear by coconut oil for just about everything, and it’s one of the few things I’ll actually use religiously on my hair. I love the Garnier Whole Blends Olive Oil shampoo & conditioner bc they’re not too harsh but also actually moisturise my hair.
2154 2018-05-19 18:14:32 is one of many good indicators, when you try to measure PPP correctly you end on many different variations of price most of them related to oil, electricity, coal, gas and taxes, It takes like 12MWh to recycle a ton of steel from scrap sorting to make ingots,2Kwh for a liter milk

2156 2018-05-19 18:14:21 Who was backing Iran then It is not secret On whose behalf Saddam acted and whose agent he was (CIA) and why was war there to prevent Islamic revolution which happened Iran which could have effect on petro Dollar and Oil religion was nothing to do with it
2157 2018-05-19 18:14:16 Chelsea are still Chelsea. A shit club with a billionaire oil man who can still buy trophies. Plastics are so dumb they're cheering a scumbag who dove to win the game and will leave them to rot now that they couldn't even make the Champions League.
2158 2018-05-19 18:14:14 Well that was JUST what I needed to hear!  I am lucky if I wash my hair twice a week, so the oil thing for sure makes it a no go option for me.  Thank you!!!

#fairtaxchanges
2163 2018-05-19 18:12:35 So is now long oil and short treasuries 
2164 2018-05-19 18:12:30 Instead of sending troops over seas to fight wars over oil, when we have plenty to drill for in Texas, how about we use them to guard schools, and build the desperately needed infrastructure?? Winner for most non-partisan, sensible and thoughtful post  of the day??
2165 2018-05-19 18:12:19 Went to O’Reillys to price oil and left with two brand new, installed windshield wipers and $26 in my pocket 
2166 2018-05-19 18:12:00 Hey US government, not only do you start dumb wars for oil and power,  but last night my friends came out to see us play and because of your  STUPID ID LAWS, they couldn't get in. I bet if my friends had OIL you would let them in, HUH WOULDN'T YA?!
2167 2018-05-19 18:12:00 ที่เช้าไม่นอนจนกว่ามึงจะไป!!!!!!!!!!!!
2168 2018-05-19 18:12:00 Be ready blues. Human Rights, Oil Money, Empty Seats are incoming. It's genuinely all they have to talk about these days. Small Club Mentality 
2169 2018-05-19 18:11:52 Decent view inside a shit oil! 
2170 2018-05-19 18:11:45 It's kind of like pancakes stuffed either with walnut, sweet cheese, or thick cream, then fried in oil or toasted in the oven and served with sugar syrup on top

2174 2018-05-19 18:11:03 Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in The Name of The LORD:
I Praise The LORD CHRIST
2175 2018-05-19 18:10:44 Most soya and palm oil is fed to farmed animals.

2194 2018-05-19 18:09:33 Even if you can stand the heat, don't come in the kitchen. We got knives, cleavers, hot oil and some of the most pissed off chefs in here.
2195 2018-05-19 18:09:31 The magic of the Money , I mean the oil , no the cup

2200 2018-05-19 18:09:12 idk why I scheduled an oil change before having work, it’s taken forever 
2201 2018-05-19 18:09:05 Oil we were so poor going forward massive changes needed, ok at the back (pen apart) but need to score more
2202 2018-05-19 18:08:57 blunt is also bought by coal, oil, and tobacco
2203 2018-05-19 18:08:52 Shocking from United, this is the worst Chelsea team since oil money

2205 2018-05-19 18:08:12 For lunch, I ate a salad made of buffalo mozzarella, grape tomatoes, basil, salt, pepper, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar, and now I could die happy.
2206 2018-05-19 18:08:00 @trevster69 how many trophies mate? Hahaha. Fucking garbage. 

Let me guess your response:
Plastic, 08er, Arab FC, Animal, Oil Money! 

Hahaha. Easy.
2207 2018-05-19 18:07:52 I work midnights 11pm-7am and haven't missed a episode yet and the same goes for Crossfire.I look forward to Fri nights. Throw in the headphones and burn that midnight oil at work listening to what's going on in gaming. Keep up the good job you and the rest of the panel!
2208 2018-05-19 18:07:44 Ace shop. Follow the smell of patchouli oil up the stairs. Wasn’t it in the same building as the Egg Cafe?
2209 2018-05-19 18:07:28 I told you before, she will come on a firey dragon. She stepped into the Boulde Rose as if she owned the place. We stood breathless as she strode to the bar, the portrait of Rose. Oil the medium. We breathed shallow
2210 2018-05-19 18:07:01 Please consider cannabis oil.

2213 2018-05-19 18:06:47 Got a free oil change today because the guy working there called me sir 
2214 2018-05-19 18:06:47 Attacking other countries for oil is what you mean
2215 2018-05-19 18:06:46 #MeeKoahcheh Its Axe oil bottle
2216 2018-05-19 18:06:35 Was referring to the short term excitedness Solomon referenced mike referencing. How do you mean dividends are procyclical?   Oil majors are distinctly trying not to be pro cyclical at this moment - small part, but noted adjustment from earnings calls
2217 2018-05-19 18:06:04 But how much will the tallow oil get 80% that means the national govt will get 75% of 20% county govt 20% of 20% and community 5% of 20%. In essence the biggest beneficiary will be foreigners with 80% of 100%.
2218 2018-05-19 18:05:54 Used a whole tube of oil paint on one tree . One tree 
2219 2018-05-19 18:05:23 Oil pens and Scooby snacks 
2220 2018-05-19 18:05:10 Oil steadies boosted by Iran fears, capped by China data
2221 2018-05-19 18:05:08 It’s the same as Indyref when they all came flying up here to convince us to stay, promising all sorts. None of which has been delivered. I wasn’t sure at the time, but I really wish we’d gone now. They’re back treating Scotland as the poor relation, as they did before the oil
2222 2018-05-19 18:04:57 Actually they just put a for sale sign out by hiring Manafort.  They were bought by outside forces from Russia/Saudi’s/UAE.  Then Bannon brought in Mercer/Koch’s money to follow through. They have kleptocratic common interests in Oil.
2223 2018-05-19 18:04:39 I asked my 4 year old about whether she wanted to watch the royal wedding or change the oil on my car and she said that both were silly and we needed to go march against Trump. Kids are so wise.

2225 2018-05-19 18:04:22 Notice this #islamophobe doesnt post rape stories when done by guys named John or perverts like Moshe?
2226 2018-05-19 18:04:21 Of course he did and he’s handing over our national treasures to big oil at the same time. #KeepItintheGround
2227 2018-05-19 18:03:57 I know where there's some oil you can kill for if you want.
2228 2018-05-19 18:03:21 @alisoneroman for the tomato anchovy bucatini do I add the olive oil with the tomatoes (roasted tomatoes recipe) or scoop the tomatoes out with a slotted spoon or similar?
2229 2018-05-19 18:03:12 dr. bronner’s peppermint products + tea tree oil got me feeling like an ice queen.

2232 2018-05-19 18:02:59 Oil and equities were positively correlated for years leading up to the last recession except for the first 6 months of 08. Inflation numbers are cooked. Hope you’re right though.
2233 2018-05-19 18:02:57 Is their any oil or gas there, the West will be interested then. At the moment they are trying to start a war with Russia,Syria and Iran. No morals exist here. It’s all about securing our energy needs and more missile bases.
2234 2018-05-19 18:02:55 Yes, it is a storehouse... but one full of gas and oil...

2237 2018-05-19 18:02:06 So much winning - for Russia. Soyabean sales and oil price (reneging on the Iran deal effect) up
2238 2018-05-19 18:01:39 GOPers claim to loathe big government meddling in our lives & businesses. They oppose regulations to protect our air & water. They legislate an intrusive form of governance seeking control over women via her uterus. They'd never seek such control upon their donor's oil well.

2253 2018-05-19 18:00:18 You’ve given big oil and the coal industry everything they could want, pipelines, drilling in the northern refuge, drilling off our coasts (except Florida), rolling back clean water regulations, etc... So why has gas gone up 25% since you’ve taken office?
2254 2018-05-19 18:00:14 that Jirani (neighbor) Kenya which "discovered" Oil after us (UG) is soon starting to export oil and will share oil revenue thus; 75% at the centre, 20% at regional and 5% at local community. Over to you ladies and gentlemen
2255 2018-05-19 17:59:09 Peterson deserves to be taken seriously and reckoned with at least. He's a clinical psych. Who's practice focused on helping addicts turn their lives around. He's not, from what I can tell, selling snake oil.

2261 2018-05-19 17:58:25 Turns out highly concentrated orange oil will dissolve some plastics. Good to know... Definitely good to know... Kinda wish I'd looked that up beforehand though. 
2262 2018-05-19 17:58:08 GM is a huge dumpster fire waiting to happen.  The Obama mpg regulations are going to ruin the company.  The fact that Trump hasn’t already killed this regulation like everything else just shows that the oil situation is going to get worse and fast.
2263 2018-05-19 17:57:56 The will be burning the midnight oil over at the INDO on how to reverse this
2264 2018-05-19 17:57:51 So Trump benefitted from an alliance against Qatar? Now Qatar is bailing out the Kushner Co.'s with a loan no one else would touch. No collusion what so ever.

How many oil exporting countries have been linked to possible collusion with the Trump campaign.  Oil prices post elect?
2265 2018-05-19 17:57:44 Don’t bomb countries creating a refugee crisis in order to prop up oil prices and then deny refugees safe harbour.

2268 2018-05-19 17:57:31 Blair & Bush who waged war with Iraq knew full well the terrible consequences for the millions of innocent Iraqi people, which as you say then led to the catastrophic wars in Syria. Their wish was to go on killing spree, trade in arms & oil & steal unique & precious antiques...

2295 2018-05-19 17:53:08 I wanted to put a snack in the deep fryer basket and as I dropped it in the basket, it fell down into the oil creating some splashes

2367 2018-05-19 17:43:29 No one is paying me. And didn't we just pay to fly a bunch of pertro-terrorists to Alberta to virtue signal about oil?

2370 2018-05-19 17:43:02 In short, it is unnecessary but highly expensive intermediation. Almost everything is financialised (a barrel of oil, a house, whatever), and that's the result of creating the need for individual financial assets (societal over-insurance).
2371 2018-05-19 17:43:00 Russia Iran will trade oil in CC
2372 2018-05-19 17:42:58 It is so yum .  Pea and lentil soup  

It's potatoes, stir fried them in coconut oil and seasoned with garlic, thyme, rosemary and Himalayan salt.  Sprinkled some lemon  to add some acid to the dish.  lemon helps with weight loss also.
2373 2018-05-19 17:42:57 I've kind of got it in my mind that one of the great benefits of cannabis at the upcoming lift event in Toronto will be in getting folks from BC and Alberta together over some great product to settle this wine versus oil b******t
2374 2018-05-19 17:42:53 Getting my oil changed and there is an infomercial on for a product called “Crepe Erase.” Ewww #whereistheremote

2376 2018-05-19 17:42:31 My cup need a oil change
2377 2018-05-19 17:42:27 I’m a doer.  Changing oil to yard work, I am hands on. Until now. Knee surgery has me completely out of the game.  And it kills me watching my wife do everything!  I very much need to call in some help - for both of us!
2378 2018-05-19 17:42:17 learned I should have just used my common cents and waited for my oil stock to come back its been a ride 100% down to 15% ,just the cherry sucks
2379 2018-05-19 17:42:14 We need you Roseanne, and I'm Canadian!
2380 2018-05-19 17:41:26 My new favourite thing? 

Gelatinous olive oil that you can spread on to bread. 
2381 2018-05-19 17:41:05 I don’t even buy cooking oil because I don’t fry AT ALL! I bake and that’s why I bought a George foreman so I can grill 
2382 2018-05-19 17:40:52 Lemme get this oil change out the way 
2383 2018-05-19 17:40:45 Actually, two school shooting were stopped by armed schools just this week, UK has stabbings instead, and yes, you can fight fire with fire.  Firefighters literally do exactly that to fight wild fires and oil rig fires.

Tired of being wrong yet?
2384 2018-05-19 17:40:30 え…エルザとは…別に…な…(ﾀﾞｯ
2385 2018-05-19 17:40:23 Mr President - we need to open up oil sands plays in Utah, WY, etc to produce the heavy crude needed to compliment the light oil produced by shale.  Only then will USA truly have energy independence.  Got your back - Making America Great Again!
2386 2018-05-19 17:40:14 Wrong. You cant keep Dollars. That is a lie. Panama has a Money Dollar making machine called The Panama Canal. Ecuador sell Oil and exports all kinds of agricultural produce to buy Dollars.

2388 2018-05-19 17:39:54 Anyone see Popeye the Sailor Man, Olive Oil, Elmer Fudd or Roadrunner around lately? Just wondering....
2389 2018-05-19 17:39:50 Lemmings and the Internet. Oil and Oil. Alex Smith is, without doubt, the most underrated, unfairly maligned QB in the league ... perhaps all time.
2390 2018-05-19 17:39:33 Russia and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The two countries are referred to as the two petroleum superpowers and account for about a quarter of the world's crude oil production between them.
2391 2018-05-19 17:39:17 I like Rhianna's response to the reporter about being invited to Harry's and Meghan's wedding. "Why would you think I'm invited?" I got an invite, but I have to clean my room & my private jet's at the Chevy dealer being serviced. You know, rotate the tires, change the oil, etc.
2392 2018-05-19 17:39:14 I went to get an oil change/tire rotation this morning, and was told by the mechanics "that's why you need a man to take care of you" - fuck this everyday #sexism. I'm still fuming a few hours later.
2393 2018-05-19 17:39:01 With oil, comes a new breed of leaders, new types of guns and a whole lot of problems, as experienced in other oil rich countries of Africa like Somalia, Sudan and Nigeria.
Kenya can't take that perceived route. Let's all pray that the Turkana Oil Protocol doesn't become a curse.
2394 2018-05-19 17:38:44 So much ignorance. This coming from the guys that raid oil from middle eastern countries, as well from the country built on the backs of slaves. Have some shame why dont you?
2395 2018-05-19 17:38:44 Looks like I can't move better pass the gas or the oil / fuck your plans it's been foiled @Chubnacio 
2396 2018-05-19 17:38:39 Eat your veggies and run some coconut oil on it.  But seriously I hope you’re making good money.
2397 2018-05-19 17:38:28 Keep it. When you start seeing 42 in the crowd at Lucas Oil there wont be any mistaking whose jersey they're wearing.
2398 2018-05-19 17:38:22 @realDonaldTrump please remove the gas regulations that prevent us from being able to alter our vehicles to run on other forms of gas. Israel did this and they don't have to rely on oil to fuel their vehicles.
2399 2018-05-19 17:38:08 Ok so I just had oil down for the first time ... it have vibes

Putin’s oligarchs Middle Eastern Oil Barrons. Price tag for aid-Relieve sanctions on Russia back Saudi UAE anti Iran desires in Middle East.
2404 2018-05-19 17:37:25 1. Never forget a percentage to Cartels
2. Is the percentage allocation based on crude or refined oil?
3. @GovernorNanok should have done thorough bargaining to work with figures not percentages, this is where he allowed a through pass #GoKThisWeek

2406 2018-05-19 17:37:14 Meh.
2407 2018-05-19 17:37:07 oh please. Venezuela has to import chemicals and equip and IT to process tar sands oil. Vn must sell at min $55/bbl to stay afloat. Oil has been well below $55. Results expected.
Vn owes foreign debts in FOREIGN currency. Neither Right nor Left diversified out of 1 industry.

2410 2018-05-19 17:36:09 I just googled and there’s a film called Megalodon from 2003 that I haven’t seen omg. SET ON AN OIL RIG
2411 2018-05-19 17:36:06 @YashwantSinha in discussion with #KaranThapar about the governments economic policies, crude oil bonanza, fare price to farmers, #demonitization. He goes on say during his term as the Finance Minister he had no time for other thing. How can @arunjaitley manage 4 ministries?
2412 2018-05-19 17:35:43 And if they were set up by informant more proof of a set up. For those of you falling for the normality of inserting a spy into an opposition party's campaign let me sell you some snake oil. Stop making excuses for the criminality of the past admin and spying. #sheep

2416 2018-05-19 17:34:58 Must understand than 90+ % of GDP in Venezuela comes from Oil. The Oil is controlled by the Gov. The gov doesn't use localbitcoins because they can mine them for free. 

95%+ of population earn less than $150 US / year. 

You are looking at the wrong metrics in Venezuela.

Be a grown man and understand that your handouts come from taxation of resources.

2445 2018-05-19 17:29:58 Thanks. Chicken tenders and fries are popular here. And I think some place use the same oil. Some have a dedicated fryer for the French fries
2446 2018-05-19 17:29:44 But I don't need see it... He has been riding the trend from Obama on jobs.. his tax system does not benefit anywhere near the claims he makes.. pulling out the Iran deal has sent oil up so we are paying more here.. and he seems to be more corrupt than Nixon ever was.
2447 2018-05-19 17:29:36 พอได้ระบายแล้วก็ยาวเลยนะ

2449 2018-05-19 17:29:34 I just started taking some fish oil but it has that slow dissolve coating/casing so it gets absorbed way down the track and also so you don’t have fish breath!

2457 2018-05-19 17:28:30 Is that why gas prices and heating oil prices have sky rocketed. Oh, that’s right corporations need to raise prices to make up for their tax $$ Welfare.

Without Kurdish resources, Turkey will be like Bulgaria, Romania or Moldova
2460 2018-05-19 17:27:55 I need to go get an oil change. But I haven't left my bed.
2461 2018-05-19 17:27:54 Made my own Magnesium oil spray for ABOUT $3. Easy peasy. 1/2 cup magnesium chloride flakes mixed with 1/2 cup freshly boiled DISTILLED water and cooled and placed in a GLASS spray bottle.

2464 2018-05-19 17:27:13 why does it always take so long to get an oil change I’ve been waiting 2 hours and I’m falling asleep
2465 2018-05-19 17:26:46 @realDonaldTrump Hey you really are a STUPID BASTARD ask anyone with Black Lung how clean and wonderful coal is and what it did to pollute the air we breathe----we all know you don't care about clean water or clean air-----just the $$$$$$ you can make by pushing coal and oil.
2466 2018-05-19 17:26:28 Come to think of it, Turkana's have oil and a vast waterbed.

They aren't throwing tantrums.

2472 2018-05-19 17:25:57 God bless you, sir.  Finally we have a leader who is freeing us from dependence on foreign oil!  Also, a strong leader who has beaten ISIS- the "JV Team", & has our enemies & friends alike respecting America again.  MAGA 
2473 2018-05-19 17:25:52 Also amazing how these nations dependent on oil revenues were so willing to throw their support behind the "global warming is a hoax" candidate.
2474 2018-05-19 17:25:48 And I haven't even mentioned the difference in product quality of our oil. The product mix that is possible to produce from bitumen is much less valuable than the product mix you get out of a light sweet crude. 
Then there is the ability to even refine our bitumen.
2475 2018-05-19 17:25:43 I've just been reacting to the still images but holy tourist in space wave, that just exponentially increased my dislike for this show.

It's like oil mixing with water. It blends together briefly, but all the elements just separate into their respective parts.
2476 2018-05-19 17:25:35 Quick question. When you buy fish and chips, do they cooked them in the same oil?
2477 2018-05-19 17:25:33 What say you about avacado oil? And coconut oil?
2478 2018-05-19 17:25:28 Ok, if you’re always right, what will be the price of oil on the 5th June of 2020? I mean if you’re ALWAYS right that shouldn’t be a problem, or?
2479 2018-05-19 17:25:16 Coconut oil is the best for dry skin.

2485 2018-05-19 17:24:54 To understand the depths of DT's depravity & sadism, you have to understand he knows & believes the climate change science: if you dig up the coal, drill the oil, release the carbon, you will destroy the earth completely. 

Despite these consequences, he'll lie to promote himself
2486 2018-05-19 17:24:53 The peppermint & lavender help with prevention too.  Mossies (mosquitos) hate lavender and peppermint is another strong smell.  

On another note, ants hate strong citrus smells (lemon, orange, ect) & it is hilarious watching 1 freak out when I draw a circle of oil around 1.

2492 2018-05-19 17:24:19 But we do have a chance to win the green race and continue to be a leader in energy when the oil game is over.

There is maybe a decade left to make real money and we need a decade of building to be ready for it. We missed the boat.

Lady was like, you just never know the reaction you may have. Everyone else acted like that was normal and nothing to be concerned over.
2500 2018-05-19 17:23:44 Had 2 this week both seized up and when asked both said they had never check oil since last service. One had not been serviced in 18 months the other in 2 years. Both offenders said. “ they never need any oil!!!”

2509 2018-05-19 17:22:57 This is all about Iran's oil, isn"t it?  "Take the oil" he said.
2510 2018-05-19 17:22:46 It's too late to do that. Every time the global glut let's up the US pumps more oil. And they have the infrastructure to ship it anywhere. Including using oil tankers with 4.5 times the oil of the largest tanker we can accommodate. 
Face it we lost the race.

2524 2018-05-19 17:21:01 Venezuela in order to protect itself against US oil & financial pressures are forced to accept entreaties by Russia & China for bases, island territories and of course oil & refineries. The U.S. media is ignoring Russian and Chinese incursion in the Caribbean.
2525 2018-05-19 17:20:54 Good source. A study done by environmental organizations. There are tax credits for exploration, which is very high risk capital. The government makes a lot of revenue of oil and gas royalties.

Is that good for the US economy when the rest of the west and even far east are advancing away from oil and coal?
2659 2018-05-19 17:04:16 Its literally a fryer that uses air more than oil lol
2660 2018-05-19 17:04:14 So why did the unionists lie about the true wealth of Scotland when oil was first discovered. Why did Thatcher systematically start on our steel industry, manufacturing, education. Remember the famous slogan Thatcher the milk snatcher

2664 2018-05-19 17:03:36 Shame on you for spending my tax dollars to subsidize oil & gas with billions, and destroy air and water quality for future generations. Humans are better than this & have technology. Tesla is not going bankrupt. They & Ford are the only 2 that never went bankrupt.

2675 2018-05-19 17:02:56 Petroleum imports cost nearly 45 percent of SL export earnings. With the expansion of private transport and increasing price of oil, situation can get worse. Obvious solutions appear to be: a) shift towards more public transport, b) greater reliance on renewable energy sources.

2730 2018-05-19 16:57:18 Again, we have no control in who burns what.  You agreed that the oil & coal demand is increasing.  Canada could live in tents with zero emissions & we won’t change a thing being such a small contribution in emissions.  If folks can’t understand that, what do you want me to say?
2731 2018-05-19 16:57:13 You do know the difference between the oil from the Bakken )oil was not as indicated on manifest) and bitumen right? We are looking at 2 years before the pipeline can be completed.  Rails about the same. Pellets can be perfected in that time.
2732 2018-05-19 16:56:55 Please don't put oil when the situation is stable again. Army just accepted it as cute nickname and take it positive. We don't wanna a war.

2800 2018-05-19 16:47:34 Shout out to the guy at jiffy lube who was the nicest guy in the world even though my oil couldn’t get changed.
2801 2018-05-19 16:47:16 You need to think twice about trusting a girl that ain’t got no coconut oil in her house
2802 2018-05-19 16:47:09 my oil burner has my room smelling bomb 
2803 2018-05-19 16:47:02 Sure Meghan Markle gets to marry the man of her dreams while looking luminous as hell today but I get to *squints at schedule* clean out my closet and then watch the latest episode of Killing Eve while trying CBD oil for the first time so... let's call it a draw
2804 2018-05-19 16:46:54 It really is not about the oil or the money it is about the coast line the preservation of it and how it we cont to keep it that way for the next hundred years. Not about humans in any way. I grew ip in Calgary Alberta and have lived on the west coast for 30 years. Cow and oil eh
2805 2018-05-19 16:46:52 Jesus spelled backwards is Susej! Like Sausage! COINCIDENCE? Abraham Lincoln hid a bunch of knives in his hat! ILLUMINATI! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
2806 2018-05-19 16:46:41 No, not usually. Only if you make hasselbackspotatis, then there's butter and oil, but otherwise...not really no.
2807 2018-05-19 16:46:37 Okay y'all I'm doing it. I'm getting dressed and going to get my oil changed.
2808 2018-05-19 16:46:35 I have reached a point in my life where I think tea tree oil will fix everything
2809 2018-05-19 16:46:30 Word mad baby oil on your booty then sit on the couch. Genius
2810 2018-05-19 16:46:24 Tamarine juice
2811 2018-05-19 16:45:58 i usually drain the oil after
yet to drain this
2812 2018-05-19 16:45:52 Ok,glad you're informed,Allah baki haquri
2813 2018-05-19 16:45:52 Anybody who doesn’t want to put harsh chemicals on your body In order to keep yourself from getting bit by mosquitos here’s a little help: peppermint oil and coconut oil mixed together! Apply to skin like a lotion and you’re good! Also keeps bees away they hate the smell
2814 2018-05-19 16:45:39 Ah, so some fuels are ok?  And the waste from nuclear plants is then good for us?  Do you have any idea the cost, danger & space needed to handle such material.  It costs more than oil in a pipeline.
2815 2018-05-19 16:45:35 Have you tried green banana flour? You could probs make no-bake energy bars from it. Load it with coconut oil, PB, dried fruit, and choc chips.
2816 2018-05-19 16:45:30 Oil change maybe?
2817 2018-05-19 16:45:03 After various doctor's visits, the consensus is that I'm holding too much tension in my body. I already meditate consistently, so I'm going to start going back to community acupuncture and I'm trying cbd oil. Any other suggestions for a cash-strapped student? How do you chill?
2818 2018-05-19 16:45:01 Hybrid කාරයෙක් වාහනේ service කරද්දි engine oil brand එක වෙනස් කරාලු. දැන් උගේ fuel efficiency අඩු වෙලාලු  ඇයි බන් මෙහෙම ගොබ්බයො වාහන ගන්නෙ??
2819 2018-05-19 16:44:50 Toh unkuu thank you for the information cos I've never even heard that. You had my full attention. Carry on
2820 2018-05-19 16:44:46 - and the water. We should sell it as other countries sell oil
2821 2018-05-19 16:44:46 Dropped tea tree oil all over my desk
2822 2018-05-19 16:44:30 I guess I’ve got to go get an oil change 
2823 2018-05-19 16:44:26 Majority of soy crushed for oil is human consumption. U say only 12% of corn is used for human consumption and half is for ethanol? Where do u find those numbers?
2824 2018-05-19 16:44:12 Idea for you all who have anxiety/PTSD/triggers like me: get a cotton ball or cotton wipe & put your favorite esssntial oil on there, put it in a little bag & take it with you everywhere. If you start getting anxiety or have a trigger, take that out & smell it.
2825 2018-05-19 16:43:52 So far this is text book oil dynamic playing out.  As things tighten, producers & speculators become less willing to sell at any discount further out, which even exacerbate the tightness.  Thanks @PlattsOil #OOTT

2827 2018-05-19 16:43:31 ahh yes the classic logic of conservatives. im an asshole for thinking the government did 9/11 so they could send troops to the middle east to hunt OIL (not terrorists). but “the government is behind the school shootings bc they wanna take my guns!!!” whatever you say bud
2828 2018-05-19 16:43:21 oil solvent can dissolve oil paints so you can “erase” your mistakes. you can also paint right over them with white or whatever base color ur using :)

2833 2018-05-19 16:42:40 When used in its raw state, garlic is antibacterial, antiviral, & antifungal. It also works as a decongestant. You can process raw garlic with coconut oil (also antibacterial) to make a salve that can be applied to bottoms of the feet for quick absorption into the bloodstream.

2839 2018-05-19 16:40:49 NO IT ISN’T. It is a day for action, successive US governments have been soul searching for years. Ditch your bought and paid for congress and senate. Educate your people and vote in some independents  - and end the hegemony of big Oil/Pharma/Guns/Money
2840 2018-05-19 16:40:44 Can we not add oil onto the extremely small fire that's been set rn... ARMYs are handling it so well by turning "sushi stan" into a cute and positive thing let's not make matters worse
2841 2018-05-19 16:40:32 The Royal wedding smelling like Coco butter , coconut oil , chicken grease & melanin  & I KNOW her mom made sure that reception food is RIGHT !!!
2842 2018-05-19 16:40:31 Asia is so much more than Japan Korea and China. But whites only know them and they think the rest is just terrorism and where they get their oil from. Its such a shame tbh

2844 2018-05-19 16:40:26 Despite the price of $OIL $WTI $BRENT and all the mess in the Middle East I’m super bearish oil. I strongly believe the LT fair price for $WTI should be around $30-$40 per barrel. The correction should happen in a year or so, and then $PBR valuation will change! #EmergingMarkets
2845 2018-05-19 16:40:23 You have to wait for the pan to heat up before you put the oil you fucking idiot

Never again....
Those Cabals crying for their oil block licence to be renewed, Never again
2851 2018-05-19 16:39:50 Our money is fiat backed by oil/force.
Programs like Obamacare raise healthcare costs- corps know the gov will pick up any bill.
Repubs never cut spending or entitlements but widen the deficit.
Other regs benefit the biggest companies and hurt small businesses.

2853 2018-05-19 16:39:42 Why does getting your oil changed have to always be the most annoying thing ever like sometimes I wish my car would just explode
2854 2018-05-19 16:39:37 Geranium essential oil smells like Fruit by the Foot.

2869 2018-05-19 16:37:46 I hate waiting on my oil changes
2870 2018-05-19 16:36:55 In fact the equity market investors may use the weakness in markets due to Oil price rise as a buying opportunity.
2871 2018-05-19 16:36:40 Gerald, 

- Several OPEC nations donated free oil to poorer nations over the decades ( yes, sone were political)  
- check OPEC Fund web site for the amounts of money and projects in poorest nations
- when oil producers suffered, no consuming nation cared
2872 2018-05-19 16:36:32 2 sessions down came in before red flag. Oil on track
2873 2018-05-19 16:36:26 MA esattamente cos'è l'OIL?

2875 2018-05-19 16:36:07 Yes. Neolibs are now onboard cause the crossing line for war was Iran’s change from $U.S. to €Euro to buy their oil. Others who tried Libya & Iraq we invaded. Syria we are trying to overthrow.

2889 2018-05-19 16:33:58 Y’all know how to change oil?
2890 2018-05-19 16:33:49 Sounds like the same people who brought us "Ethical Oil"  Lol
2891 2018-05-19 16:33:37 Lol, it's a type of maiduguri people's drink. Has nothing to do with wealth 
2892 2018-05-19 16:33:34 She wanna kiss the coconut oil off me 
2893 2018-05-19 16:33:30 I've spent enough time in VNZLA to know the populace has always expected the government to care for them via their oil wealth. The people that were poor pre-chavez are poorer today but not only that those that had businesses are equally as poor.
2894 2018-05-19 16:33:26 I know with children dieing, this is on the back burner, but hell they crucified Obama when the gas prices hit $ 3.00 a gallon. trumps oil men getting theirs now. And we suffer again. WHAT TAX BREAK?
2895 2018-05-19 16:33:25 Don’t try selling me a 2018 GT... I’m only here for an oil change.
2896 2018-05-19 16:33:22 I want to inject my nose with eucalyptus oil coz I’m over it being blocked
2897 2018-05-19 16:33:13 The snooze button got me until I realized adulting was something I had to do...like oil change,  MS walk and laundry.  Which = nap snooze later today
2898 2018-05-19 16:33:13 Demand is peaking. And in per capita terms oil use is already declining globally. This is year 1/40 in year 20/40 the market will be significantly smaller. By 30/40 it will be even more reduced. By yr 40 oil as fuel will be less than a rounding error on GDP.
2899 2018-05-19 16:33:03 Harry lookin real thin up top. Meghan needs to start the nightly coconut oil application NOW!!
2900 2018-05-19 16:32:43 If you do not like coconut, oil pulling is definitely not for you ... 
2901 2018-05-19 16:32:34 Emang segala per-oil-an nih ampuh bah ye.
2902 2018-05-19 16:32:25 I’m adulting today and getting the oil changed in my car. The entire drive over to the service center, rain threatened. I pull my car into the service center and as I’m talking to the lady at the desk, the sky opened up. Good timing.
2903 2018-05-19 16:32:20 Lol. Ok.  Google.....how many coal plants are set to be built.  Then google....global oil demand.  And I don’t need to insult you because I disagree with you. Again, have a great weekend. Love you.

2905 2018-05-19 16:31:35 I'd like to assure you we're committed to giving you great value on fuel in all filling stations. We closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic increases. Alisha 2/2

2907 2018-05-19 16:31:20 Said that a few years back about Man U, Liverpool, Arsenal & Chelsea but since then Man City have bought their way in and Spurs have done a good job of putting themselves in contention. We just need a rich oil Sheik!

2909 2018-05-19 16:31:15 I went to get an oil change in Delaware and they said it was gonna be $96 lol I was like well nevermind then bc I get it done in New York for $60 and then these mfers wanted to start taking money off the price. Like what. lol
2910 2018-05-19 16:31:09 I just wish he'd put moisturizer in his hair. Meghan needs to have him do hot oil treatments
2911 2018-05-19 16:31:00 1. Why is govt at all levels unwilling or unable to work together to #stopthesoot the same way they fought Ebola?

3. What is the concrete response from RVSG to the issue?

2916 2018-05-19 16:30:29 I'm not really a fan of Amazon's rather predatory, monopolistic nature. Amazon has become the new standard oil because of how it loves to gobble up other companies and brands. But Trump targeting them because they own the @washingtonpost is both corrupt and chilling.
2917 2018-05-19 16:30:25 I meant pure, liquid fish oil! In my childhood it was of the most effective medicines improving the immune system I believed, ate it and did not disgust!
2918 2018-05-19 16:30:20 setau aku sih kenapa pake lube instead of oil, karna kond*om tuh kalo kena oil bisa robek(?)

2919 2018-05-19 16:30:16 I saw Cruz speak. He is a sleazeball and not one thing he said was correct or had any empathy or true emotion. Hoping he is voted OUT and we never see that NRA arse kisser and sociopath again. All the oil in TX in his greasy hair could not make him look good.

2921 2018-05-19 16:29:55 When one oil well closes, the U.S just invade another country with wealthy oil reserves under false pretences and downright lies. When Israel massacres innocent Palestinian women and children, the U.S blame the democratically elected Palestine government and call them terrorists.
2922 2018-05-19 16:29:53 No, sir. According to USDA, I was pretty close to right.  For corn, 48% is used for ethanol, and 40% for feed. For soy, over half is exported, and the majority of the rest is crushed for soybean oil and meal.
2923 2018-05-19 16:29:29 If corn oil comes from corn, where does baby oil . . .
2924 2018-05-19 16:29:14 The machines is less than human the main function of oil the cars need we do as well 
2925 2018-05-19 16:29:11 I’m ready to put coconut oil all over this pasty white body and go cook myself outside for a hot few hours tbh
2926 2018-05-19 16:28:57 NIL action ON PETROL DEISEL PRICES

2939 2018-05-19 16:26:42 @JustinTrudeau has no clue about what he actually says most of the time.  In reality, a restructured NAFTA agreement may benefit Alberta. The original sacrifices oil and gas pricing in favour of industrial commodity sales which are primarily generated in Ontario and Quebec.
2940 2018-05-19 16:26:33 Mix coconut oil, shea butter & cocoa butter together.....skin be feeling bomb...
2941 2018-05-19 16:26:17 ยันจับก้นอิพี่หนงก็ทำมาแล้ว
2942 2018-05-19 16:26:03 I will wear a tank top and shorts. And use tanning oil if If makes you feel better.
2943 2018-05-19 16:26:01 Driving over the bridge into Seaside for an oil change I had an epiphany. Learning other languages gives a deeper understanding of language as a concept and the deeper associations beyond words.
2944 2018-05-19 16:26:01 Biasa pake paling terakhir sblm oil sih
2945 2018-05-19 16:25:52 右手が痛くなってきた…
2946 2018-05-19 16:25:51 HAHAHAHAH BUSTED YA i thought so too but... vegetable oil............. bro......
2947 2018-05-19 16:25:18 Of course Matt, the cooks are ordained, so they bless the chicken as it is being cooked in the holy oil.

2949 2018-05-19 16:25:16 That’s...interesting since he said marijuana bud wasn’t available legally in the medicinal dispensary, only vape oil or digestible oral capsules. Whatever he’s smoking doesn’t appear to be either? 
2950 2018-05-19 16:25:08 If sacred native land is less important than a pipeline, why would this stop them? So sad that oil is more important than life. 
2951 2018-05-19 16:25:05 What? None of this makes any sense. There’s no such thing is clean coal. There is no war on coal. Other energy sources are cheaper and that’s why it’s falling out of favor. And recent oil techniques like fracking have reinstated the US as the energy leader! We’re already there.
2952 2018-05-19 16:25:03 That's the dream and the aim.
2953 2018-05-19 16:24:44 ~ wilderness and then north toward the Beauclair Ports. He knew a butcher there who could properly prepare the lamb, next to whom resided an apothecary where he could restock on leather oil and herbs that doubled as spices.

In a matter of an hour or so Dettlaff returned, ~
2954 2018-05-19 16:24:37 Took a shower and oiled my body w coconut  oil now im sleepy asf
2955 2018-05-19 16:24:14 It’s not declining.  Global oil demand is increasing, as is coal.  Currently 1600 coal power plants are booked for construction,  700 with China alone.  Any progress we make can be wiped out by 1 business deal in China.  The developing world is building coal plants.
2956 2018-05-19 16:24:11 Sheriffs and cops that TURN FROM CRIME and don't do their jobs!,
Gang Stalking using taxayers money (time, gas, oil, vehicles). Strealing! What is taking a bribe from an illegal entity? STEALING.
Thou shalt not Steal!   I probably can't help these people BUT I PRAY FOR THEM.

2959 2018-05-19 16:23:44 The deficit is falling despite the oil revenue collapsing. 

Can you explain why you use economics to oppose Scotland's independence when you support a country (UK) that always considers independence as priceless and thus the overarching answer to all of its economic problems?
2960 2018-05-19 16:23:11 If you're looking for a good bread for sopping up oil & vinegar, you could do worse than Seattle International's Classic Sourdough. It is a light sourdough with the consistency of sandwich bread. Not exactly SF consistency (softer) or flavor (much milder), but absorbs every drop.
2961 2018-05-19 16:23:06 Come to think of it: if we went to Iraq for the oil. Why gas prices still so high?
2962 2018-05-19 16:23:02 holy shit is vegetable oil even safe to be used as a lubricant for anal sex????? im getting nauseous djjdjd

2964 2018-05-19 16:22:36 Why is PMB not refurbishing the refineries so that our crude oil can be refined at home? Most of our Northern youths are now codeine junkies and what is he doing about this?  PMB does not deserve a second term.  God shall give us justice against the political class. ENOUGH.
2965 2018-05-19 16:22:34 Why tf is my glade plug in not doing what it does best like I even changed the oil and like I’m odee confused
2966 2018-05-19 16:22:30 Been using virgin coconut oil on my face for 3 days and I’m already seeing the difference.

2968 2018-05-19 16:22:23 People keep suggesting variations of this same thing. Hard to remember when the fanbase held a lower opinion of their GM than Oil Country does of Peter Chiarelli just now.
2969 2018-05-19 16:22:12 When ROTW pledges to support oil prices, by paying above the s/d balance price, in order to shield oil prod nations from down cycle price variation, then I'll consider there is some sympathy from oil prod nations towards consumer nation economies. Ex that...talk is cheap.
2970 2018-05-19 16:21:51 I respect every Muslim brother but I don't like treachery with #ISLAM and Muslim brothers...they have to suspend their diplomatic relationship with america stop supply their oil to america instead they are going more close to them
2971 2018-05-19 16:21:43 Italian Bread is cheap. So is vinegar. Olive oil isn’t but it goes a long way
2972 2018-05-19 16:21:42 How many muslims killed by illegal wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and now Syria?  Millions - just so UK and USA could get their hands on oil, gold reserves, etc.  Shame on you - learn the truth and not from our media owned by just 6 companies.
2973 2018-05-19 16:21:26 Racing stopped after a blow up has spilt oil on a section of track. Clean up is on going and racing will resume as soon as possible
2974 2018-05-19 16:21:24 i hope meghan massages some castor oil onto harry’s scalp cause that nigga already balding
2975 2018-05-19 16:21:15 I was responding to your buddies comment  he said “mostly gone in 50 years” lol. So what if it is 40 years then?  Still lots of time to make revenues.  If you would rather pay for infrastructure versus have oil revenues pay for them for free to you....ok.  But that’s odd.
2976 2018-05-19 16:21:11 Maybe....it seems plausible...i think it will remains at 80-85 till end of summer.  OPEC wants to stabilize oil prices.

2979 2018-05-19 16:21:01 I believe that was truer under President Obama. However, we may not be as reliant on Middle East oil as we use to be, the Trump crime family relies on them to bail out personal debit, etc..666 Park Ave.
2980 2018-05-19 16:21:00 You know who got a huge boost in their oil prices after 45 dismantled the Iran deal? Russia. You know who’s paying more for gas now? Us
2981 2018-05-19 16:20:53 I haven’t put heat in my hair in sooooooo long and now it’s going like crazy  and I take mane choice vitamins everyday and use wild hair growth oil  I need 30 inches quit playing w me

2983 2018-05-19 16:20:29 me: i want to eat only whole foods, and raw as much as i can
also me: *bakes cupcakes with a ton of oil, flour and sugar*
2984 2018-05-19 16:20:28 The voters should decide.  But we are seeing a number of very revealing candidates. Anti Israel. Pro BDS,truthers and anti vet-anti oil. That is would be some caucus.
2985 2018-05-19 16:20:21 Well said!! There is a lot to be done!! We need to burn our night oil. No easy solutions to complex problems. But solutions do exist!
2986 2018-05-19 16:20:18 Michael is very right in that the US Gov. wants war with your country. And if you think for a moment you can have a regime change without bloodshed, you are sorely mistaken. Trump wants your oil, and money. Have you seen the bases, not there for peace and freedom #Israel #WW #NH8
2987 2018-05-19 16:20:15 The simplest really good thing I make is Greek chicken (I’m sure it’s not actually “Greek”). It’ll sound odd but seriously trust me, it’s good and super easy. 

In a big pot, heat up some oil (I like grapeseed, but olive or canola are fine). Then add a package of chicken thighs.
2988 2018-05-19 16:20:07 Please if you know the guy who started the red oil scandal,tell me...I need to employ him/her...good marketing
2989 2018-05-19 16:20:06 That's great to hear. Haven't felt better since the time I swapped my ex-GF's Mountain Dew for THICK COOKING OIL
2990 2018-05-19 16:19:57 I just bought jasmine tea scented deodorant & also have jasmine perfume, body oil and hair perfume. My quest to always smell like Jasmine milk tea is COMPLETE!
2991 2018-05-19 16:19:36 I've made up my mind to be great InshaAllah...
2992 2018-05-19 16:19:23 Hard roll with butter is better. Better yet is Italian Bread dipped in olive oil and vinegar with some grated Provolone cheese mixed in
2993 2018-05-19 16:19:10 내가 꼭 모든 독재 정치의 그늘을 밝혀내는 사람이 되리라.
2994 2018-05-19 16:19:07 That's 50 years of declining demand. Do you think you make a lot of money in a battle for marketshare in a declining market? 

The smart money is investing in the replacements for oil. Because that market will be growing and expanding as the oil market shrinks.
2995 2018-05-19 16:19:06 私も料理空水中だめです。
2996 2018-05-19 16:19:00 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
2997 2018-05-19 16:18:58 I suspect this will also happen in the Middle East once the oil runs out
2998 2018-05-19 16:18:55 それだけではないけども、ゲームしたり動画見たりがとっつきやすいねー。
2999 2018-05-19 16:18:49 @justinmayet @WolverineXOX  No one knows exactly. But there is an Oil momentum for the sector + it’s low debt and pioneer in this industry.

3004 2018-05-19 16:18:05 Tesco: diesel/litre £1.27. Also Tesco: 5 litres vegetable oil for £3.50, which is £0.70 per litre.
Diesel drivers might be tempted to save quite a bit on fuel there!

3009 2018-05-19 16:17:13 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for activated charcoal enemas, and put some dirty rose essential oil in my diffuser.
3010 2018-05-19 16:17:09 Probably? Toss some asparagus in light olive oil/salt/pepper/garlic, wrap it in thin sliced ham and bake em. The ham gets crisp and almost bacon-y

3014 2018-05-19 16:16:43 In NC it's still illegal. Hemp oil is, but doesn't seem to help with chronic pain. My pain doc said he would drop me if I use hemp oil because it will show up in urinalysis - all patients have to test every 30 days. I do have many friends w chronic pain & H oil doesn't work.
3015 2018-05-19 16:16:22 IT'S OLIVE OIL...
3016 2018-05-19 16:16:03 Why is porn is so goddamned annoying? like why so much oil? why these cheap ass press on acrylics? why these dumb ass plots? why y'all so loud and ridiculous? why so nasty and not in a good way? why so fucking extra period?
Calm tf down its sex
3017 2018-05-19 16:16:00 Energy is same - corruption 
Petrol not only according to price for of oil, but levies added by government. 
That why everything keeps going up, nothing comes down.

3019 2018-05-19 16:15:43 Exactly what Russia wants....US pulls out, Russia increases presence, and cements a foothold in the middle east placing just that much more control on oil producing nations...control the oil, control the world economy

3028 2018-05-19 16:14:37 Not so familiar with Shapiro, but Peterson is opposing ultra-left dogma with snake oil. The religious right with a pseudo-intellectual face, and at worst a charlatan who is milking disaffected young men for money.

3031 2018-05-19 16:14:30 Yeah. It lost oil pressure. We got a ride and called a tow truck

3034 2018-05-19 16:14:05 Beat me to it. The oil producers want more money for their oil.
3035 2018-05-19 16:13:39 "batteries not included"
Faux-green organizations are commemorating: coal/oil/gas, "greenwashed" by intermittent renewables, is beating carbon-free nuclear energy.
3036 2018-05-19 16:13:37 Yes, he's from there. So was Janis Joplin and football coach Jimmy Johnson. Tough area since the oil wells shut down.

3038 2018-05-19 16:13:35 Yes they are but in a sense it's government's fault. The petrol price keeps yo-yo'ing. Previously we used our oil reserves to keep price stable, only putting up when oil prices really spiked. That why we had very cheap food then.
ANC sold our oil reserves for a loss. 
Look into
3039 2018-05-19 16:13:34 Mark your calendar for OIL DAY!! On July 10th, 7-10, we will be celebrating one of our favorite days of the year! Gunna be otta this world..

3042 2018-05-19 16:13:07 European Union will be sending her battalion over in the middle East and take away Iran oil
3043 2018-05-19 16:13:03 Who did you offend in your former life. 
3044 2018-05-19 16:13:02 
3045 2018-05-19 16:12:59 Oh, come on. Oil money Bush #41 goes to war to defend oil producer Kuwait? Somehow not indicted son Neil Bush? You might have trouble finding something on Carter and Eisenhower, but Johnson and Kennedy?Putting it all on Hillary is too much.

Trump is qualitatively different.
3046 2018-05-19 16:12:47 I’m waiting on an oil change at the dealership and Fox News is on in the lounge and they’re talking about how the best solution to stop school shootings is to have more guns in schools. WHAT THE FUCK.
3047 2018-05-19 16:12:23 That moment when you getting an oil change and there’s coffee yet no creamer!
3048 2018-05-19 16:12:19 Olbas oil. One or two drops on a handkerchief. Inhale.

3051 2018-05-19 16:12:00 #Vision2030...no one is tweeting about this. It could be a way to improve relations with the Middle East by diversifying the economy to more than oil. I feel that with #Brexit we as Brits are on the forefront of leading trade talks with Saudi Arabia. (1/2)
3052 2018-05-19 16:11:48 えぇ、大丈夫ですか…
3053 2018-05-19 16:11:46 We can have our cake  and eat it too. Taking care of the Earth  doesn’t mean abandoning what God had created. We MUST NOT call what God has made unclean. In Genesis, The Lord called all he made good. Coal is good and so is oil.
3054 2018-05-19 16:11:43 But they will take oil from Washington if AB turns off the taps. It is all about landlocking AB oil.

3082 2018-05-19 16:09:14 I wonder if it will ever be disclosed that oil isn't a fossil fuel and it's abundance is second only to ocean water? Therefore shouldn't be so freaking costly. Thank you for freeing the coal industry. Evil wants to control all our resources.

3087 2018-05-19 16:08:02 And that is why people are sick of our political morality. Personally glad that he BJP threw in the towel. Now letthose who burnt the midnight oil in the SC do the same to bring the State back to normalcy and show progress. That is the only test.
3088 2018-05-19 16:07:48 Be thankful you are heating with gas an not oil. It costs me $700 per month to heat my home in the winter.

3091 2018-05-19 16:07:34 I am a bad ass, I shave with a samurai sword and discarded oil from a ‘77 GTO. 
3092 2018-05-19 16:07:22 Yeah... by buying oil from Russia, Europe has more leverage in Russia ... and the US wants that Europe is doing more for its defense and securing borders with trade is our approach ... maybe the US wants to define what we should do and what not ...

3101 2018-05-19 16:06:07 You were probably up north, where they use more butter for cooking. Also, most Italian restaurants here follow southern Italian traditions (tomatoes, olive oil)

Fresh, wholesome, nourishing food is freakin’ expensive.
3108 2018-05-19 16:05:14 2nd Law of Thermodynamics also applies to denominations. "Everything has a natural tendency to move from order to disorder". SBC needs an oil change & tuneup & maybe a new engine!

3113 2018-05-19 16:04:21 I think that the Canadian federal parliament ought to establish a law saying that any proponent wanting to export oil from Canada must also establish an equal amount of refining capacity in Canada.

3120 2018-05-19 16:03:27 By accident? Like saying "One would have to be truly delusional to think" effective med treatments can be made from anything but oil.  Yet, surprisingly, that's where we are in medicine thanks to John D. Rockefeller. Do some research.
3121 2018-05-19 16:03:20 I think you forgot to add:
-driving up oil prices
3122 2018-05-19 16:03:18 Are you paid by the oil and gas industry in any way to say or promote these things? If yes you should make it clear.
3123 2018-05-19 16:03:15 i need an oil pen asap
3124 2018-05-19 16:03:05 I been looking for my coconut oil since yesterday still no luck 
3125 2018-05-19 16:03:04 honestly im terrified to go to school. im scared of walking in the halls by myself. a few years back my school was in a lock down. we were told it was an oil spill, but later I found out there was a shooter near the grounds. ive been terrified since kindergarten im in 6th grade.

3131 2018-05-19 16:02:22 Today I had to buy new tires and get an oil change and adulthood SUCKS
3132 2018-05-19 16:02:15 Walking on oxford street and what should catch my eyes. A store selling space cakes, weed oil and a whole set of marijuana parphernalia. Gobsmacked.
3133 2018-05-19 16:02:12 All my previous tweets were brought to you by me waiting for an oil change
3134 2018-05-19 16:01:59 Sure they were but your car takes more oil and coal etc before you've put any fuel in the tank.

The point is to reduce oil usage today. So that eventually it won't be such a requirement in our lives. Oil as fuel will be mostly gone in the next 50yrs oil for other uses likely not

3137 2018-05-19 16:01:41 I hate going to get oil changes more than anything bc 1. The men always try to scam me bc they think I'm dumb and 2. It usually works bc I'm dumb
3138 2018-05-19 16:01:34 I've just got Saffi a honey and something shampoo to try for her flaky skin, now I've just gotta get her outside for an alfresco bath  I'll certainly I to coconut oil, is it just ordinary stuff or special pooch stuff?

3142 2018-05-19 16:00:51 However, there is a direct and strong impact on oil demand in the short in Europe and Asia when oil prices and the US dollar rise together significantly.  We have seen riots in Europe in 2000 because of this combination
3143 2018-05-19 16:00:50 @realDonaldTrump  national directive to convert commercial vehicles to compressed natural gas. Cause a huge opportunity for infrastructure and reduce oil demand, start with all government vehicles. #justathoughtfromohio

3145 2018-05-19 16:00:16 This is the one which bugs me the most. 
“... but I saw a single welfare Mom w/ an iPhone...” that’s the worst!
Or protest anything and you get called out “... don’t they have a job...”
Or speak out against unwanted oil pipelines “... did they all walk to the protest...”
3146 2018-05-19 16:00:15 You have to careful in comparing reserves 1-1.  Not the same oil, thus different extraction requirements.  PdVSA requires more technical and challenging extraction, and likely has a much lower EUR, regardless of total volumes. I hope they can recover, truly, but unlikely.
3147 2018-05-19 16:00:09 Remember if you're changing your own headlights, don't touch the glass. Oil from your fingers can cause cracks sooner.

3160 2018-05-19 15:58:12 Democrats & Republicans are NOT 2 sides of the same coin.  They're not the same coin or same national currency at this point.  

Ask yourself, who truly benefits from America's isolation, the dissolution of NATO, Oil shortages, & the degradation of America's Democratic Process?
3161 2018-05-19 15:58:05 Texassitan is a country on to itself. Guns,God,& OIL and exactly in that order. Outside of all the major cities in the "state" these are its "citizens".

3168 2018-05-19 15:57:01 Uhh, they kill the same amount or more people. How is that a false equivalence? Do you NEED those things in your life? So why should those people die? If your kitchen oil spill had the SAME effect as the BP oil spill, your damn right it would be comparable.

3170 2018-05-19 15:56:36 Yes it can, oil will still be used for generations.  And we can build our own green infrastructure from the revenue, without taxation.  Ships, planes, trains & trucks keep you alive.  They don’t run on hippie farts.  And won’t for a long time to come.
3171 2018-05-19 15:56:26 Ok, I get you. I partly agree w you. My main issue w Obama was his use of drones and his failure to do squat about the Deepwater oil spill that ruined half our coastline. That's what I'd like to hold him more accountable for....
3172 2018-05-19 15:56:20 Does this body oil kinda dry into your skin ?? Or it it like baby oil.
3173 2018-05-19 15:56:14 I have a new favorite essential oil! I had never diffused Bergamot by itself until today.. It smells aaaamazing!
3174 2018-05-19 15:56:07 You are mixing Political fight and fight for the supremacy of oil to religion.Islam on the whole had faces PERSECUTION right from Ibrahim Alaisalam till now. Show me any religion which had faces such PERSECUTION.
3175 2018-05-19 15:56:05 Like you, I am not scared or worried about co2, and I laugh in the faces of those who claim that coal, gas, oil and co2 are cooking the planet. 
3176 2018-05-19 15:56:03 My heart goes out to all of the families that have lost loved ones in the land of sand and oil. I would- as a veteran- like to thank the war for profit republicans. Thanks for the spinal injuries and the bed that I am restricted to for life.
3177 2018-05-19 15:55:30 This is a nice graphic but where exactly is this being done.  Nowhere I suspect.  The oil industry will not spend the money.
3178 2018-05-19 15:55:28 just put some coconut oil on them to tame them down after you do your hair or a little bit of hairspray
3179 2018-05-19 15:55:10 Nice "Decorative Facade" for coal/oil/gas that will prevent parliament members from freezing to death at night or on cloudy/snowy/not-windy days.
solar&wind = "greenwashing" for fossil fuels in order displace carbon-free nuclear energy
3180 2018-05-19 15:54:48 Cool, and your bicycle & shoes are made partly by & brought to you by.......oil.  Listen,  when you folks sleep outside, make your own clothes & hunt your own food (which you would cook over a fire) please let me know.  I will wait for that tweet. Have a great weekend. 
3181 2018-05-19 15:54:39 Fish oil lip gloss. That was a fav in Primary school.
3182 2018-05-19 15:54:30 Am a chemical engineering student with passion to work in the oil sector, however, its very unclear on how to access this industry without a "connection " I besiege you Mr President to create an absorption platform for us in the university. This is what I grew up wanting to do
3183 2018-05-19 15:54:23 I'm also inclined to think kids 40 years ago didn't get so many colds because their parents came through the culture of feeding them vitamins. Cod Liver Oil capsules and Haliborange tablets were very common. Doesn't seem thats the case any more.
3184 2018-05-19 15:54:19 Yeah that’s an Indian spice, used for making curry... I’d read up on it, there’s tons of info on how it’s used for medical treatments. It’s pretty much like a wonder herb... you could try coconut oil rubbed on her coat,@BuddyRalphio uses it all the time

3189 2018-05-19 15:53:52 oil is the hardest to replace, although estimates of electrification of transport are ramping up. coal is first to go, then nat gas, then oil. there are gradations to climate response beyond the ubiquitous demand for oil ...
3190 2018-05-19 15:53:47 I'll have to try this out! I already use those dryer balls with some lavender oil but this also sounds like a great idea! #EssentialOils #LaundryDay #Corked
3191 2018-05-19 15:53:43 I got spoiled up here bro lol cut, shampoo and condition then line up and a hot oil towel.
3192 2018-05-19 15:53:38 Ok, time to fix that. Send it back, use our own oil.
3193 2018-05-19 15:53:35 Oil leak?
3194 2018-05-19 15:53:28 Big oil figured 30 years ago left elitist would launch ‘green’ revolution cleverly orchestrated with some idiot celeb to fight completely stupid battle that would be very difficult to counter. Not because greenies are right but because they’re able to win public opinion.
3195 2018-05-19 15:53:28 Oxygen therapy vitamin C infusions mistletoe and hemp oil have all proven to be effective.
3196 2018-05-19 15:53:18 Malibu Dry Oil in my eye, I’m going to end up with Glaucoma and die 
3197 2018-05-19 15:53:02 Tofu in curry is ok, and you can also "pan fry" it with a little oil and some oyster sauce. (I grew up in a Chinese household.)
3198 2018-05-19 15:52:48 I remember Stinson Beach... rose oil, and wild dolphins in the surf
3199 2018-05-19 15:52:31 Getting Pearl a oil change. 

They are so dramatic here 


3200 2018-05-19 15:52:25 I have never said to not move to green infrastructure.  You can look at many of my tweets regarding this issue, I have said many times we need to capitalize on the growing global oil & coal demand & simultaneously build green infrastructure.  It can be both.
3201 2018-05-19 15:52:23 I'm try to make this oil last me at least a week and half 
3202 2018-05-19 15:52:16 Unfortunately, the gas prices were low partly because we lifted restrictions on Iran. They have huge oil reserves.
3203 2018-05-19 15:51:42 Does HEB have mustard oil?
3204 2018-05-19 15:51:37 I can change my own tire.
I can change my own oil.
I can cut/weed eat my own grass. 
Dad taught me allat.
And all my trashcans small so I can take out my own trash.
I have my own funds.

So what you offering to bring to my table??
3205 2018-05-19 15:51:29 It can be key to oil price. Or, it can be background noise. Anyone who thinks it is either or, always, is wrong. I concur that the mantra of oil will follow DXY is voluntary ignorance, for the benefit of simplicity, but it can be right, at times, too. The trick is to be critical.
3206 2018-05-19 15:51:23 Can someone remind me, just why am I at work on a Saturday, off that Oil

3208 2018-05-19 15:51:20 So basically the cost of a litre now being in the range it was when oil was half as much per barrel is taxes and weak CAN $?
We really are hostage to oil and gas

3213 2018-05-19 15:50:36 Please don't preach on fiscal deficit.We all know if the crude oil prices remained at $120/ barrel the country would have be running behind IMF/World Bank for loans.Please express truth & not lies.

3219 2018-05-19 15:49:09 The real problem is hand waving away the real problem while real people suffer.  But I’m glad you’re looking out for Nazis selling snake oil on college campuses and dragging the kids who are having none of it.  NYT should offer you an OP-ED spot soon

3223 2018-05-19 15:48:27 I always just rub a little bit of coconut oil between my hands (A LITTLE) and then run it through the dryest bits, personally. So like, around my part/temple and the ends esp.

3225 2018-05-19 15:48:03 I’m getting an oil change rn and the guy was explaining the costs to me. He goes “alright! So I’m going to make this quick and easy like prom night...”

3228 2018-05-19 15:47:25 @newsnz Don't understand how New Zealand can afford to give $5.5 mil to Hillary Clinton's snake oil Foundation?  Do the people know their leadership did this?  Whoever agreed to it, what does Hillary have on them.  Her Foundation is just a money laundering org.
3229 2018-05-19 15:47:17 Dawson wouldn’t stop crying so I got my young living essential oil “gentle baby” and rubbed it on my chest and put a tiny bit on his nose so he could inhale it and he was out within a minute  I love essential oils!!!

3235 2018-05-19 15:46:49 If you dont know propaganda comes from the rich to buy influence.  So you are telling me the apricit and castor oil lobby are powerful?  Coffee enemas were in the Merck manual until the 70's a doctors refernce manual.

3242 2018-05-19 15:46:17 Like I said....I feel like this should have occurred in a kiddie pool filled with dirty  deep fryer oil, during lunchtime at a strip club, with an all you can eat buffet being served.

3254 2018-05-19 15:44:49 Yeah. Kinda like you calling people twats. Great debating language. When oil went from $100 to $50, was there more US production and investment or less. Spoiler: less. And many drillers went out of business.

3260 2018-05-19 15:43:56 Unfortunately the pollution of our atmosphere does not yield itself to a border.  Your fracked water and runoff from oil exploration will eventually pollute the US.

3274 2018-05-19 15:41:52 I am not advocating that we ignore TWD. Just saying it's time to give up simplistic and wrong idea that it is key to oil price.
3275 2018-05-19 15:41:40 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
3276 2018-05-19 15:41:40 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3277 2018-05-19 15:41:35 That’s true. Oil changes for a Benz alone are ridiculously priced unless you do it yourself. Personally would goose a 2018 Honda for the reliability

3281 2018-05-19 15:40:59 But U r giving Petrol Rs80 when crude oil per barrel was $26 also.

In 2014 ,Crude oil was $110,petrol was 75, that time it was high & BJP was protesting.

Both Center & states r taking tax Rs35 per liter. 
Per Day 1 liter, one common people giving tax 365*35=RS 12775 per year.

3334 2018-05-19 15:32:32 The cheapest energy will and already does come from renewables. Why do you think we need $70 or $100/ barrel to mine oil sands! Because the extraction process is too expensive! This is NOT cheap! Stop oil & gas exploration subsidies & shift our tax $ to renewables

3347 2018-05-20 23:59:14 What about restoration after oil extraction is done?  I get we need the oil.  Why can’t they pay to restore when done?  Shameful.
3348 2018-05-20 23:59:09 India will be cheering as they grab the resulting cheaper Venezuelan crude... Real question is who will trump bully to go along with sanctions that most of America’s allies will not likely support without a case. Trump’s friends like Russia, Saudi Arabia aren’t oil buyers, iae...
3349 2018-05-20 23:59:03 #Dateline thank you for the episode about CBD oil helping people.
3350 2018-05-20 23:58:42 That’s why they save some money. They make good money. Enough money to save and spend money on stuff they want. So they can get their own place when they choose to leave the oil field. Duh
3351 2018-05-20 23:58:38 What can be done w/these pharma companies that their hands&money in the pockets of politicians...They need to let CBD oil heal these people...

3353 2018-05-20 23:58:14 I understand pride of place, but the Rhodesia reference is so loaded for so many. Have always had fascinated talks w old Rhodesians, and even the sister of a Selous Scout who I met once at shop buying olive oil.
3354 2018-05-20 23:58:01 Eucalyptus oil isn’t good for you if you use it too much, be careful.
I usually make green tea, and while it’s brewing hold my face over the cup to inhale the steam with a towel over my head to trap steam in. It was amazing last spring when I was ill
3355 2018-05-20 23:58:00 After a quick none dish soap cleaning with a stainless steel pad, I apply a small amount of olive oil after slightly warming cast iron pan. Seasoned now and ready for next use. I love my cast iron pan....
3356 2018-05-20 23:57:56 After I get oil changed tomorrow I'm going to work on that fandom thing seriously

I feel so lost. I'm not used to not having to think about 6 classes all at once.

3360 2018-05-20 23:57:43 You can't drink oil -- but apparently you can make plastic kayaks out of it.

3364 2018-05-20 23:59:46 @SenGillibrand watching you on dateline regarding to Cannabis. I have RSD crps I am full body of the painful disease. I am treated with opioids. If cannabis oil could change that, then please HELP!
3365 2018-05-20 23:59:23 I love having that baby oil/lotion smell on me
3366 2018-05-20 23:59:14 What about restoration after oil extraction is done?  I get we need the oil.  Why can’t they pay to restore when done?  Shameful.
3367 2018-05-20 23:59:09 India will be cheering as they grab the resulting cheaper Venezuelan crude... Real question is who will trump bully to go along with sanctions that most of America’s allies will not likely support without a case. Trump’s friends like Russia, Saudi Arabia aren’t oil buyers, iae...
3368 2018-05-20 23:59:03 #Dateline thank you for the episode about CBD oil helping people.
3369 2018-05-20 23:58:42 That’s why they save some money. They make good money. Enough money to save and spend money on stuff they want. So they can get their own place when they choose to leave the oil field. Duh
3370 2018-05-20 23:58:38 What can be done w/these pharma companies that their hands&money in the pockets of politicians...They need to let CBD oil heal these people...

3384 2018-05-20 23:57:08 Please watch Dateline tonight.  The report is regarding CBD oil effects on kiddos with terrible seizure disorders.  It can be life changing for them and their families.  Also, an answer to the Opioid epidemic and for those who suffer from PTSD.   #LiveABetterLife #RescheduleIt
3385 2018-05-20 23:56:44 #SC here - I was awoken from a nap by my husband telling me I needed to watch. Didn't tell me why. I was pleasantly surprised by the storyline! I am in the CBD Oil business. #OpioidsKill
3386 2018-05-20 23:56:35 Anyone here ever used Helichrysum oil?? Would u recommend it
3387 2018-05-20 23:56:32 Watching #Dateline about CBD oil and its positive impact on treating epilepsy and cannabis for pain
3388 2018-05-20 23:56:29 You know in Roman times, upper class men wore togas so that they could easily pull them up to have quick and easy access to their dicks an ass. It made it easy to have anal sex with another man. Most togas even had hidden flaps where they kept bottles of olive oil to use as lube.
3389 2018-05-20 23:56:20 Q olor a gas oil me quedo la puta madre 
3390 2018-05-20 23:56:18 Y el gas ? Las nuevas estufas a leña, las tradicionales a leña ?, el fuel oil ?? Que pobre nota
3391 2018-05-20 23:56:06 Are you going to be in the oil field for the rest of your life?? You’re just NEVER going to have a house?
3392 2018-05-20 23:56:03 I like my grits with olive oil and garlic.
3393 2018-05-20 23:55:52 I like the foundation so far. It covered the redness I have on my cheeks really well. No oil shining through on hour 8.
3394 2018-05-20 23:55:43 Making herb oils in new Vitamix blender is a cinch, & quite different to the result the new food processor gives. I love the Vitamix. Disappointed in some functions of new "Pro" food processor (diff brand). Will show you difference in herb oil in photo later. (ping @VitamixAUNZ )
3395 2018-05-20 23:55:38 Spent most of the day canvassing for a progressive congressional candidate, now going to buy CBD oil for my dog. I REALLY live in LA.

3401 2018-05-20 23:54:07 You mean the global perception that the United States is a free meal ticket?
3402 2018-05-20 23:54:05 There is very little need in an urban environment for fossil fuels. No one said oil will not be a useful resource in the future. But at a fraction of current usage worldwide.
3403 2018-05-20 23:54:00 Who chills oil?
3404 2018-05-20 23:53:54 I talking rubbing her down.. Head to toe in coconut oil every night after her shower.. 
Never had to ask..didnt even ask the first time...

Mfs don't appreciate shit.
3405 2018-05-20 23:53:40 They are the big oil companies that are now set up in Iraq. Bush said we would get repaid in oil, the “we” being Cheney, the Bush Family and The Big Oil companies that are there.

3409 2018-05-20 23:53:33 Thank you @DatelineNBC for showing the very real benefits of CBD oil!
3410 2018-05-20 23:53:24 In the face of evidence they still deny he lied when he's caught on camera. No consequences, no shame, no embarrassment or remorse. Amazing
3411 2018-05-20 23:53:23 I make it. Cauliflower, onion garlic, celery, sweet pepper in my food processor. 30 secs. Dass it. Stir fry in coconut oil, little salt, 2 min and it's done.
3412 2018-05-20 23:53:08 Has gone higher, this deficit will only widen in the absence of any other major income through exports that can offset the rise of oil imports. Given that FII’s are sellers ( rising rates, falling rupee and absurd Equity Valuations),(2/n)
3413 2018-05-20 23:52:59 Quick update: oil based hair pomade feels gross when it runs down your face after walking to the car in the rain
3414 2018-05-20 23:52:47 To do would the NDP have to mandate the price. In order to mandate price they would need to nationalize oil and refinery companys Venusalua

3417 2018-05-20 23:52:24 Theres a whole segment on TV about CBD oil ooo
3418 2018-05-20 23:52:23 I can’t believe they will be drilling for oil in Yellowstone.
That so pissed me off. I even called Lindsey Graham’s office to bitch.
3419 2018-05-20 23:52:02 We will surely have a consolidation zone at this level but the oil companies should continue their progression. Until now they have underperformed ...The Xeg just broke is big resistance
3420 2018-05-20 23:51:43 The problem with your thesis is that somehow you expect agriculture to take up the slack in protein production. I'm sorry to tell you this, but oil based agriculture is just as unsustainable and once you eliminate other sources, won't be sufficient to feed the world.
3421 2018-05-20 23:51:36 simple solution. Stop shipping all oil, gasoline, and natural gas into any state/ county that is suing. That will make them practice what they preach.
3422 2018-05-20 23:51:34 Been embraced it. CDB oil helped my uncle a lot with his cancer treatments.
3423 2018-05-20 23:51:31 Where can we find a transcript of tonight's show? I'm in the CBD Oil business and would love to pull some quotes from some of the doctors. Thanks!!
3424 2018-05-20 23:51:24 So you expected instant gratification? He's one year into his presidency, the wall will get built. I suspect he will stop foreign aid to Mexico increase taxes and add a dollar a barrel tariff to Mexican oil. Might take 20 years but he has options to make them pay for it.
3425 2018-05-20 23:51:07 Sliced and roasted with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
3426 2018-05-20 23:51:02 In this time of abundant oil in the United States, diluting real 100% gasoline with a less efficient ethanol makes no real sense, unless you are a corporate farm eager to sell more corn to the ethanol makers. End the ethanol mandate and let’s have better car mileage.
3427 2018-05-20 23:51:02 Jaitley’s biggest disaster has been gross mismanagement of the economy despite enjoying a windfall of low oil prices in the first 3 years of the term. Rather than deploy it fornincome generating assets, they splurged on stuff so much that they widened deficits. Now that oil (1/n)
3428 2018-05-20 23:50:42 Im sure trump profits from oil prices
3429 2018-05-20 23:50:36 Date line NBC is doing a special on CBD oil
3430 2018-05-20 23:50:17 Since the ban on US crude oil exports has been lifted.Gas has increased,we should reinstate the ban,kep US OIL in the US!
3431 2018-05-20 23:50:11 Great-grandfather won an oil well in a poker game...then bet that and won some land in SoCal. And then found out to access it he had to cross the land of very unfriendly neighbors. THAT's still in the family... But every gen gets a little something in my fam on both sides.
3432 2018-05-20 23:50:02 I will pass on the oil but I’m still eager for a slice of pizza flavored women! lol
3433 2018-05-20 23:49:56 Stir frys are so easy to do, and are always tasty and nutritious (cos tons of veggies), and healthier than some other options (very little oil used) and you can put p much whatever you want in them. You'd just need a big frying pan or a wok, and you're sorted
3434 2018-05-20 23:49:53 Oh yeah.... Survived pancreatitis w/multiple organ involvement, too... cannabis helps ME with blood sugar maintenance,  too. I also protect against the flu w/Thieves Oil. Havent had the flu in 10 years. #CannabisIsMedicine

3440 2018-05-20 23:48:35 That’s true, they should bridle the oil price. Most of the people think it’s all because of centre taxes and not aware about state taxes. Everyone condemn bjp government for the hikes.

3444 2018-05-20 23:47:30 I think small changes can really help a lot of things, even some major things. I’m mostly talking about people who tell you to try fish oil when you have a brain tumor because FISH IS GOOD FOR YOUR BRAIN!

3446 2018-05-20 23:47:00 @audreyassad did you start using cbd oil? If so, what are your thoughts?

3449 2018-05-20 23:46:32 There is no intention to stop the use of CBD oil. Its readily available everywhere. It doesn't need a prescription.
3450 2018-05-20 23:46:32 More importantly, how the hell do you rinse off soap made from oil?
3451 2018-05-20 23:46:25 Fanbase too. Vegas doesn't have to put up with fans/media crying about a 3rd line winger not scoring 30 Gs. 

Oil Country is too focused on player output, rather than if they're playing hard or fast.

In the last month Looch was winning every battle & fans still wanted him out.
3452 2018-05-20 23:46:24 Hi Vine, I hope I find you well,  I was hoping you might have any news about clean energy technology?  It sadness me to think that oil tycoons (deceivers) know about clean energy.  As they have to much to loose$$$, things will never change, therefore, Pollution will kill us all.

3455 2018-05-20 23:45:24 CBD oil is NOT  a Drug!!!

3456 2018-05-20 23:45:14 My mom's van oil cooler hose cracked while on the high way and was able to make it to a hotel before engine started knocking. This old man let me used his tools and everything and was able to patch it up to get home. He didn't let me give him money. Good people still exist

3465 2018-05-20 23:43:36 I order my CBD oil from a vendor online. Thanks.
3466 2018-05-20 23:43:35 Dateline NBC currently has a special on about CBD oil in a lady that almost died taking prescribed medication.
3467 2018-05-20 23:42:45 "peer nations"  One of the problems in convincing the gun nuts, of course, is that they believe  US has no peers. 
It is a totally exceptional perfect creation, not comparable to any other country.
Stats, frequency, rates etc don't mean anything to those blined by the snake oil.
3468 2018-05-20 23:42:27 EID is an evil, antienvironmental group dedicated to exploited the most dirty, energy inefficient oil resources on the planet.
3469 2018-05-20 23:42:24 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
3470 2018-05-20 23:42:24 According to MANMOHANOMICS subsidising petrol & diesel to please the people did not work for CONGTARDS in elections but the oil companies were nearly bankrupt. U LIARS reveal the price of crude when misrepresenting facts. Canada has it’s own oil yet it’s CAD1.40 per liter of gas.
3471 2018-05-20 23:42:01 Is anyone interested in a free cbd oil business? 
3472 2018-05-20 23:41:58 "The waste comes from oil drilling, which requires an average of 12 gallons of water for every gallon of oil that is produced "  This is false.
3473 2018-05-20 23:41:52 I hear if you get the oil instead of broth, it’s a game changer though.
3474 2018-05-20 23:41:42 start with the shea moisture Jamaican black castor oil line + wild grow.
3475 2018-05-20 23:41:38 I tend to use olive oil rather than margarine/ butter
3476 2018-05-20 23:41:36 @dpradhanbjp Sir, fuel price in India was deliberately kept high in India even when the price of crude oil in international market was low.The benefit was never passed on to Aam Aadmi.Pls recheck the facts.Thanx @narendramodi
3477 2018-05-20 23:41:23 Brilliant. You used kayaks made from petroleum, that were transported there by petroleum guzzling vehicles. So you increased the demand for oil to protest the use of oil? Do you know how stupid you look? #TMX #ableg #bcpoli #cndpoli

3481 2018-05-20 23:39:51 I do use cbd oil it helps me tremendously forget taking toxic drugs
3482 2018-05-20 23:39:48 If you're watching Dateline, you now know the miracle of CBD oil from cannabis. That's just starters. THC stops
cancer. Warning CBD does not
3483 2018-05-20 23:39:16 Do you know how many regulations (taxes and fees) have been added over Barry's 8 years? Thousands.

Ever consider that a regulation on latex would force your health care costs up? How about 500 new regulations on the oil industry? Does this make you healthcare expensive?

3485 2018-05-20 23:39:04 In Honduras you support electoral fraud. Venezuela only cares about oil
3486 2018-05-20 23:38:32 *Seems Oil Industry not “RELIANT” on ANY “Pipeline”... OTHER USEFUL USES For Fossil Fuels... #MELODRAMA
3487 2018-05-20 23:38:31 When you clarify the oil change you just got was actually for your car and not your vagina.

That.
3488 2018-05-20 23:38:31 This @DatelineNBC about medical marijuana is absolutely fascinating! We need the US Government to not only allow more research, but endorse research! If CBD oil is the only thing that works for some people, with little to know side effects, why would we deny them?!
3489 2018-05-20 23:37:58 Positive outcome between US and China Trade, could be very bullish stock market.
However, still bullish crude oil and Brent crude oil prices. 
Expect Brent will climb back above $80 again..
Good news regarding $GE stock, bullish for Dow Jones.
3490 2018-05-20 23:37:54 Omg. My glow oil is finished 
3491 2018-05-20 23:37:46 I’m sorry, Dateline! It’s about CBD oil and a big segment is about CPP sufferers
3492 2018-05-20 23:37:45 If you are planning on being at the Women’s make and take oil class at 9:30 this Saturday Morning, please let Emilee Norman or Lisa Shurtleff know (or comment under this post) so we can get a head count for supplies!  You won’t want to miss this!! 

Thanks everyone !
3493 2018-05-20 23:37:44 I've actually followed the case quite closely.  No new information here.  This snake oil salesman has zero remorse and refused to listen to the last judges conditions.  I really think this "new evidence " will end up burying him deeper.  Good luck,  he's going to need it.  Bad.

3495 2018-05-20 23:37:25 I swallowed a bug, had to empty the mower bag 70,000 times and I ran out of the gas/oil pre-mix for my string trimmer. But, other than that, everything went great!

It looks so much better now.
3496 2018-05-20 23:37:17 Gas prices soar
US oil prices top $70 a barrel for the first time since 2014
3497 2018-05-20 23:37:03 Tried to help my mom with iftar and the oil spat and burned my arm. 
This is why my mom doesn't let me help smh
3498 2018-05-20 23:36:42 In Honduras you support electoral fraud. Venezuela only cares about oil
3499 2018-05-20 23:36:34 Either you're traveling the jungles needing to keep it moving even if you don't really want to, or oil is fucked. This is how I interpret this :)
3500 2018-05-20 23:36:31 @MrEugeneMonroe thank you again for your relentless effort and platform to advocate for medical marijuana and cbd oil. Have crohns disease here and really appreciate what you do.
3501 2018-05-20 23:36:31 OMG, Twitter is not ready for this! Consider the consequences of your actions! 
3502 2018-05-20 23:36:19 Less oil
3503 2018-05-20 23:36:08 Asparagus, good olive oil, lemon, garlic, salt...... my favorite way to make my pee smell weird
3504 2018-05-20 23:35:54 bullish crude oil 71.78 1/4 assets
3505 2018-05-20 23:35:38 Wow.. ain’t shit wrong with Jasper.. he just needed oil 
3506 2018-05-20 23:35:17 You're a rube, you've bought the snake oil and are defending your purchase to someone who knows that the snake oil is a con, it doesn't work.
But, as Mark Twain said "it's easier to fool a man than convince him that he's been fooled"
Wake up!
3507 2018-05-20 23:35:03 When you buy cheap hair oil and your hair ends up looking wet when it’s dry.. so you have to rewash it in the space of an hour 
3508 2018-05-20 23:34:58 I found that if I rub cbd oil on my tummy that helps a lot. I hope you find some relief. 
3509 2018-05-20 23:34:57 @DatelineNBC  hi I am looking at harry on TV about the oil from wedd I am sorry I write like this but some times my brain is slow I have systemic lupus an I had surgery for my knees and I got sick my daughter came home and found me. On the floor please contact. me
3510 2018-05-20 23:33:59 I need oil for my oil pen asaaaaapppp, who got in Queens 
3511 2018-05-20 23:33:30 I feel like they will be burning the midnight oil to do plan something terrible to counteract this.
3512 2018-05-20 23:33:21 The deep state is actually a liberal theory that Alex Jones and FOX stole. It refers to the military industrial complex, the wealthiest bankers and oil companies. People like the Koch Bros and the Mercer’s. You people have turned the tables on your own viewers.Your the deep state
3513 2018-05-20 23:33:19 Hence why these oil prices will never last
3514 2018-05-20 23:32:53 お布施は無給労働です
3515 2018-05-20 23:32:48 I seriously don’t care. I have terrible arthritis and have tried numerous anti-pain meds and all they do is screw up my head and stomach. I am now trying CBD external cream and oil drops.
3516 2018-05-20 23:32:29 I take anti-seizure medications to help my symptoms. And it is good to know that CBD oil may do it much much much better 
3517 2018-05-20 23:32:25 I refuse to smoke so finding out I can take a pill or rub oil on my skin I was all Sign Me Up! I delayed registering because I was caring for my granddaughter & wasn’t taking any chances with a baby in my care. She’s in daycare now so...hello cannabis 
3518 2018-05-20 23:32:08 You got that right. This is no election. It is a narco dictatorship in bed with the cartels. There will be no legality in Venezuela unless the USA intervenes and stops buying their crude oil.
3519 2018-05-20 23:31:57 The real play is to force Iran to dump reserve oil into the market dropping prices short term and bankrupt the regime long term. Bring them to the table and stabilize the market's and China with  oil
3520 2018-05-20 23:31:50 Tried olive oil? That's my go-to when I get itchy ears :3
3521 2018-05-20 23:31:22 Nice, thanks for highlighting those. I’ve had good luck with $PAA/$PAGP in the past, but been out for awhile. Could be a good pickup if oil prices stay high as they made a big investment in the Permian. Really nice yield on it too.
3522 2018-05-20 23:31:22 Alaskans own 2,720,000 shares of YANCHANG PETROLEUM INTERNATION, worth $65,099. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in HONG KONG.
3523 2018-05-20 23:31:21 @jiffylube First time customer and last time customer. Not only did the service member strip my oil pan/plug but he caused my vehicle to leak so much oil that I had to purchase new oil all within the same day to save my engine. #Oil #NeverAgain
3524 2018-05-20 23:30:50 People don't know it cost twice pump price for the Merchant Marine gaurded by the Navy to deliver us our gas.  It's subsidized by the gas industry, we exports more oil than we import. But ours is of a grade bad for high performance engines.

3528 2018-05-20 23:29:54 I’m watching DateLine on NBC show, Growing Promises. It’s about CBD oil and medicinal benefits of medical marijuana. As for myself, I’m not looking to get high, but I’m 100% committed to getting healthy. The Hempworx #CBD has significantly improved my wellness. #DateLine #Hemp
3529 2018-05-20 23:29:52 You didn’t butt in to the original conversation? Ha! You must be new to Twitter.
“Narcissist” & “liar” aren’t personal attacks? Ok, boss.
To answer your question: A friend. I’ve got my Twitter peeps’ back when their character is besmirched undeservedly.
Have a good afternoon.
3530 2018-05-20 23:29:23 Arthur accepted the glass Thomas offered him and quietly looked down at it. He had always gotten himself drunk before jobs like this. Hell, he had always been drunk for anything. Seeing as he had temper issues, the alcohol had always been oil to the already flaming fire. —
3531 2018-05-20 23:29:16 Sustained a hot-oil-spatter injury frying chicken 4 family couple weeks ago; similar herpoid burn under my lip. I took it as an excuse to grow a beard. Now it's healed up. That doesn't really help you, huh? Must be some lesson. Got it: We both defying gender expectations! Booyah!
3532 2018-05-20 23:29:12 Also watching a report on cannabis oil and therapy in MS patient care. Seems to work on a lot of people. Hope you're having a better day!!!
3533 2018-05-20 23:29:06 Ya know that feel when you press your face against a window and it leaves an oil mark?
3534 2018-05-20 23:29:00 Yesterday I switched off the engine while I waited in line for an oil change. Car wouldn't turn over when I went to start it so I ended up changing the battery.
3535 2018-05-20 23:28:53 Date Line right now about CBD Oil
3536 2018-05-20 23:28:49 2) The Burr Conspiracy is similarly well-documented, but largely forgotten. I would further argue that the Kennedy assassination was a coup, intended to put an "oil man" in the WH, and have written a fictionalized account of a conspiracy against Reagan.
3537 2018-05-20 23:28:37 Be sure to take your oil.
3538 2018-05-20 23:28:13 Who is watching Dateline right now?  If you wondered about this oil I talk about, turn it on..there are so many good stories!!
3539 2018-05-20 23:28:07 Agreeing with you is a very odd feeling.

3542 2018-05-20 23:27:47 Hey they are talking about CBD oil on Dateline
3543 2018-05-20 23:27:40 @EvanLSolomon  as long as we have politicians who think Cda is defined by how well oil is doing, we will continue to be divided.
3544 2018-05-20 23:27:38 @beautyandplanet  I love the murumuru butter and rose hair products and body wash&scrub!Will you make dry shampoo with these ingredients?Or a light oil to put on hair before drying to help with frizzy hair&to help combing tangles out?Maybe a spray to make hair smell in between
3545 2018-05-20 23:27:29 .@RepCarbajal supported, voted for and lobbied for expanded offshore oil drilling along the #CentralCoast in 2008. Since 2015, he has taken thousands upon thousands of dollars in oil & gas money. Yet he wants you to believe that he's against more drilling. #CA24 #decision2018
3546 2018-05-20 23:27:26 Is there anything better than the smell of garlic frying in olive oil on a Sunday?
3547 2018-05-20 23:27:23 what products do you use to keep your hair soft? straight up coconut oil? Please help my hair has come so dry!! DOVE PLEASE 
3548 2018-05-20 23:27:15 Peanut oil will remove it.
3549 2018-05-20 23:27:13 so my head isn’t producing enough oil which is making my hair dry butttt my face has the opposite problem :-)) nice
3550 2018-05-20 23:26:55 21st century snake oil intended to seperate fools from their money.  It’s a very old scam.
3551 2018-05-20 23:26:46 These rubes in Angrywhitemanistan indoctrinated on faux newspeak fraudcasting spewing doublethink at them 24/7 would rather not know how criminal #TubbyTrump is.
It'd mean they have to admit that they have been taken by the snake oil con man & that's just too painful a betrayal.
3552 2018-05-20 23:26:40 #Dateline I can’t wait to get my cbd oil. #MedicalMarijuana is acceptable for #fibromyalgia plus #arthritis I live with daily/hourly pain & want to give up Percocet if cbd oil will work just as well without addiction risks.
3553 2018-05-20 23:26:27 for some reason with crepes, it sticks when you put oil/butter
3554 2018-05-20 23:26:23 I hardly think so... I am in the energy area -trying to integrate renewables and candidly, that pipeline is needed. We don’t get off oil in a week.. without it, our costs will go up a long way... I drive an EV so I don’t care but Abbotsford commuters will.

3556 2018-05-20 23:26:11 Can you explain oil changes when you are emotionally prepared? Thanks in advance.
3557 2018-05-20 23:26:02 I was under the impression that CBD oil is legal in all 50 states. I’ve been able to buy easily online. #Dateline

3560 2018-05-20 23:25:32 OK. Google is BIG. But I have numerous alternatives which I sometimes use. This is NOT Standard Oil, that owned all the refineries. You have alternatives. Duh!
3561 2018-05-20 23:25:30 いぇい
3562 2018-05-20 23:25:23 #dateline is just proving to us why we need CBD oil to be legal throw your opiates in the garbage and educate yourself, friends.

3564 2018-05-20 23:25:04 how are olives so gross but olive oil so good

Despite Venezuela being richtest country in oil in the world, people are starving. Regime is not able to provide food, medicine and not even make toilet paper.
That is great achievement when you nationalize all.
3577 2018-05-20 23:23:14 Write to your Governors,  Senators ,Congressman's ,President,  And tell him to release some crude oil,  To bring the gas prices back down to a reasonable price ! That's why we elected them in there,  For them to help us ! Not to bring a hardship on us ! my opinion
3578 2018-05-20 23:23:10 Tips on stretching ears and healing ear piercings:
Coconut oil is your best friend

Once a week I clean my freshly pierced holes on my ears with it and my stretched lobes! Soreness is gone, redness is minimal, and healing process is way faster

3583 2018-05-20 23:22:23 The Altona Refinery is a blight on the West of Melbourne.

Fossil fuels are a dying industry and the sooner the refinery closes the better.
3584 2018-05-20 23:22:17 I know that’s right.  I heard her oil good. I gotta get some.
3585 2018-05-20 23:22:13 Lmk how that goes, been trying using coconut oil. Need something new
3586 2018-05-20 23:22:01 (incidentally: even adjusting the point of comparison to the snake oil salesman from UofT y'all use as defense for your ideological garbage fire, Bailey's still about a thousand times more qualified)
3587 2018-05-20 23:21:44 Bath & Body Works has an oil similar to the Fenty Body Lava.
3588 2018-05-20 23:21:27 So you can buy otc allergy pills to make methamphetamine in your garage,  you can raid someone’s bathroom cabinet for their oxycontin and dilaudid, but cannabis oil is a no no? #Dateline
3589 2018-05-20 23:21:21 I bought an oil that makes my hair smell like a beautiful garden and I am here for it
3590 2018-05-20 23:21:17 Either way, when you take out the expenses for gas and for oil changes, and consider how inexpensive it was overall (car is a 2014, has 50K miles, I paid $6K for it), I'm a happy camper.
3591 2018-05-20 23:21:16 Olive oil at least has science behind it. A number of studies have been published on the benefits of olive oil. I haven't read any reputable studies on coconut oil. Personally, I stay away from it.

3594 2018-05-20 23:21:05 because then we couldn’t kill brown people and steal all their oil!
3595 2018-05-20 23:21:04 Combination and kinda sensitive. Im allergic to mineral oil
3596 2018-05-20 23:20:59 i feel this on a level try some ginger ale and both peppermint oil and lavender oil are very good also cucumber water is a blessing for food reactions girl 
3597 2018-05-20 23:20:51 Important Tip

Because of the Roza, if your lips are dry, hand and feet are burning then apply a drop of mustard oil into your belly button.
3598 2018-05-20 23:20:30 Exactly. And making us more dependent on the Middle Eastern, Russian & other foreign oil again, and so many things that all Americans can be pissed at, not just liberals & progressives. I'm trying to make liberal/progressive issues a big part, but not all, of my focus vs. Trump
3599 2018-05-20 23:20:19 Or the Russians, AT&T, all Internet giants, big pharma, oil.......list can go on and on. Oh well. I guess it’s thoughts and prayers!

3607 2018-05-20 23:18:32 #EWopinion Sounds like a  Snake oil economy. Let's not do that.
3608 2018-05-20 23:18:24 I put oil on it and everything even washed it
3609 2018-05-20 23:18:17 I know! So I just made it in a tbsp of olive oil because it had lower calories.

3612 2018-05-20 23:17:23 There's so much conflicting information on coconut oil...
3613 2018-05-20 23:17:22 Obama pursued (to the dismay of his environmental critics) an “all of the above” policy…with emphasis on promoting recyclables and leading the Paris accord to limit impact of fossil fuels. Trump is heavily under the influence of a world oil producer (Russia).  So there is that.

3615 2018-05-20 23:17:01 oh pleazzze!  Epodilox?  So big pharma has already turned cbd oil into a big money making prescription?   and whats worst is that the DEA is ok if its prescription but not okay if you grown it in your back yard. #dateline

The antisemitism of the Arab world today is essentially anti-Americanism (which includes  Israel)”

3618 2018-05-20 23:16:55 Quit trying to limit THC levels. 3% is ridiculous. CBD oil doesn't work for me at all. It's way to weak so I have to buy weed to get relief. Why do stupid people feel they have the authority to make so many suffer?
3619 2018-05-20 23:16:55 Chef Louis cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with toast.
3620 2018-05-20 23:16:47 Is Venezuela’s collapse temporary? What about the need for mid-distillates? The high API shale oil clearly isn’t cutting it as Singapore mid-disty stocks have blown through 2008 lows, in the face of massive demand growth. Shallow analysis like this reflects poorly on The Globe.
3621 2018-05-20 23:16:47 They have not seen anything yet the oil sector,evrytin is as far as am concern dis buhari administration is full of corruption,pdp power to the people
3622 2018-05-20 23:16:38 so locals in Turukana will get back 5% from oil drills  while other stake holders take the rest yet the locals are the ones affected 100%?????

3627 2018-05-20 23:16:02 Well, I suppose that is true in today's environment, if it is in moderation. It seems to be the trend. But with this study out, the narrative of smoking (or ingesting) pot for "medicinal" purposes is debunked. If the oil w/o THC is just as effective, they seek the high. 
3628 2018-05-20 23:16:00 Interesting how quick politicians are to get your vote but when you reach out to them with legitimate concerns they’re more evasive than a snake oil salesman even if a constituent -walk the walk as well as you talk and be accountable to those who got you there #springst #auspol
3629 2018-05-20 23:15:46 Have used cbd oil less than a week...no headaches today, better digestion, had zero! cramps during my cycle, better mood, back pain isn't gone but def lessened. I can't wait to feel the diff in another week or 2. :)
3630 2018-05-20 23:15:42 The government needs to release crude oil,  So the gas prices will drop down to a reasonable price.The Working Poor cannot afford these kind of prices !Most poor work at for a minimum wage,And with a family to support,these prices are just ridiculous ! my opinion
3631 2018-05-20 23:15:38 my curls are marinating in banana, honey, coconut oil, olive oil, and one egg.

I thought that's what he was supposed to do regulate this kind of stuff,   When he was elected into office ! The rich gets richer,  And the poor gets poorer,  My Opinion
3637 2018-05-20 23:14:24 Yeah your right it’s not equal it’s complex. Canadian oil extraction is the cleanest most technically advanced systems in the world and getting better every year. Saudi, USA, Russia can’t compete. That’s why they fund anti Canada activists. They’ve been at it for years 
3638 2018-05-20 23:14:14 Are you saying that a country with an positive balance of trade would struggle to manage its own currency, the only issue that arises is when the currency is so strong and based on a single asset such as oil, which happened to Holland. Thankfully Scottish oil is worthless.

3641 2018-05-20 23:13:47 I think of that money as dirty because of all the family fighting over it plus yuck oil. I moved to the west coast and never took a dime. I still ended up having good life.
3642 2018-05-20 23:13:47 Nothing has happened.. is right. With Brent at 80, something needs to happen to ensure that it keeps going up. Doesn't mean that it oil is going to crash either but known events such as Venezuela election are priced in. #OOTT

3653 2018-05-20 23:11:38 Where is the evidence that oil sands are very high cost? Just saying something doesn’t make it so. Have you really done a comparison of the full cycle development costs between avg shale plays and high quality SAGD projects?
3654 2018-05-20 23:11:28 Hemp is the answer. It can be used to produce oil, therefore create  "plastic" that could be biodegradable.
3655 2018-05-20 23:11:26 Don’t heat flaxseed oil! It’s seriously toxic. To season cast iron, use olive oil or butter.

3697 2018-05-20 23:06:52 it’s a step that the gov’t &settlers have typically skipped altogether & haven’t respected. The last straw for Mi’kmaq ppl arguably occurred when they were not properly consulted by the gov’t or Texas oil SWN for the use of unceded land which led to the anti-fracking movement.4/8

Oil prices or central bank?
3699 2018-05-20 23:06:31 Oil supporters against clean air? Guess you guys can't use that. Try arguing facts, instead of making pointless statements. You want to lead one of the most successful provinces in Canada, not a playground. #Stupidarguments

3703 2018-05-20 23:06:01 Unfortunately, i think big pharma will fight to claim a patent on cbd oil so they can take it away from people and make it into a drug for sale.   #dateline

3749 2018-05-20 22:59:35 1.40/litre here in ontario, 1.60/litre in bc 4 litres in a gallon, thats 5.60 a gallon or 6.40 a gallon in an oil PRODUCING country!!
3750 2018-05-20 22:59:35 FBI is always investigation the mob, you know that. Get ready to see your family in jail first, then if you live long enough, you. Assets seized (if you truly have any). How are those oil prices...
3751 2018-05-20 22:59:27 なんなん？
3752 2018-05-20 22:58:56 I need some CBD topical oil or ointment for joint pain when the weather sucks ! I’m in pain !!!!
3753 2018-05-20 22:58:43 Any high smoke point cooking oil. Flaxseed is recommended, but peanut or canola will do just fine! I use Crisco, but I don't recommend the health-conscious follow my example.

3756 2018-05-20 22:58:35 Ha bhai tab ke crud oil ki price aur aaj ki price main bahot farq hai..
3757 2018-05-20 22:58:33 最高最高
3758 2018-05-20 22:58:30 I always enjoy starting my day with splattering oil and burns all over my hand. #ouch #clumsy #painful

3760 2018-05-20 22:58:17 Got me some avocado oil. Feeling so #keto now
3761 2018-05-20 22:58:15 Still seeing a lot of early-stage oil stocks out there -- obviously the group is herky jerky but worth taking note of after their huge base-building efforts during the past year
3762 2018-05-20 22:57:59 I’ve been driving the VW a lot & I noticed weird smoke coming out. I think the turbo housing cracked & some oil has leaked into the exhau...okay the girls have stopped reading by now. My gf is gone & I need something to do. How’s Farcry? Or should I wait for the new Black Ops?

3764 2018-05-20 22:57:51 Driving behind a car towing oil barrels.

Friend 1: What do you think is in those barrels?

F 2,3,4 (in unison): Waste.

Me (in unison but not): Mutilated body parts and headless dolls.

F 1-4: 

* I think it’s clear which one of us is the writer.
3765 2018-05-20 22:57:47 I've said this for years...it was just like Dwayne Roloson for the Oil in the '06 cup run. If he didn't get injured, Edmonton would've had a sixth championship.
3766 2018-05-20 22:57:42 Its high time we create our own snapchat filter lets do this!
3767 2018-05-20 22:57:42 Long smocks and thigh boots were standard before the introduction  of oil skin trousers and a short smock. Thigh boots & an apron were great whilst gutting in the summer time or if it was dry.

3769 2018-05-20 22:57:16 Yep, just that easy. Drizzle asparagus with a little bit of olive oil. Salt and pepper. Wrap in bacon. Grill on medium high 20-30 minutes.
3770 2018-05-20 22:57:07 My brother got my oil changed  I Love being the baby.
3771 2018-05-20 22:57:01 The oil pipeline will be coming soon.
3772 2018-05-20 22:56:49 We use good ole lard here in WV. Crisco is good too. It’s important to wipe it down with the oil every time you use it too. And if the ovens been on just pop it in there while it cools down to help cure it on there.

3775 2018-05-20 22:56:31 We have more oil than Saudi Arabia. New pipelines opened by @POTUS should mean more supply .. NO? #Rigged
3776 2018-05-20 22:56:29 Okay man , Thanks bro 
3777 2018-05-20 22:56:17 電車で久々に不安定な場所に陣取ってしまった
3778 2018-05-20 22:56:17 The only way that’s going to happen is create more supply. And that means more oil companies, more competition and at least 3 new oil refineries right here in Ontario. The big 3 are always sharing product now because alone, none can keep up with demand.
3779 2018-05-20 22:56:01 We need non political security enhancement that doesn't involve constitutional questions or lengthy court battles.
3780 2018-05-20 22:55:58 yes there is the word λαδι in Greek which means oil and is used metaphorically to describe a totally calm sea.Then we say η θαλασσα ειναι λαδι which means the sea is oil
3781 2018-05-20 22:55:51 Stefan, you're a complete fraud. You're a snake oil salesman.
3782 2018-05-20 22:55:34 U mean an oil filter lol

3784 2018-05-20 22:55:26 @simonefiasco just ordered some beard oil finally!

3786 2018-05-20 22:54:54 You know you're in a black church when you smell oil sheen.
3787 2018-05-20 22:54:47 Your WCW fries plantain with palm oil..
3788 2018-05-20 22:54:43 Just ordered a Clarisonic bc they were finally having a sale so I could afford one. Just purchased a new moisturizer & added a new oil into my skin care routine. Catch me next month with a glowing complexion. 
3789 2018-05-20 22:54:24 #CONs blamed @RachelNotley for the plunge in World Oil prices that happened B4 she won the Elxn. Still do, refuse to accept any Facts or Logic. #cdnpoli
3790 2018-05-20 22:54:21 I wonder why countries with crud oil especially ( African) experience a lot of terrorism attacks.
3791 2018-05-20 22:54:16 Getting an oil change seemingly monthly, but the traveling is very much worth the time spent with you 
3792 2018-05-20 22:54:15 The deal was with the UAE to end the Iran deal, so the UAE can get top dollar on their oil.
3793 2018-05-20 22:54:03 可愛いですよねwww
3794 2018-05-20 22:54:00 Ok then drink oil since it's so goddamn safe and clean.
3795 2018-05-20 22:53:58 Patty Favila Shinozaki do you know where I can buy 90/10 blend oil?
3796 2018-05-20 22:53:46 $uso #cl_f under 71.60 be greedy shorting oil.. scalping to swing stop limits
3797 2018-05-20 22:53:45 Just another example of gluttonous American corporate greed. Turn a military vehicle into a prestige vehicle that gets 8 miles per gallon, instead of developing existing technology that would make passenger cars get 75 miles per gallon.

Hmm, bed buddies with big oil, maybe? 
3798 2018-05-20 22:53:18 Bout to get on this oil

3802 2018-05-20 22:52:10 Could the world please stop being obsessed with coconut oil? I can’t even find a bar of soap I’m not allergic to. Can we get back to our La Croix obsession instead? But pronounce it correctly?
3803 2018-05-20 22:52:08 SS.  Your copy is stellar, essential reading for oil patch. Your takes on Opec and Saudi are spot on.  Stay strong&focused. 42 years in the oil biz.

3805 2018-05-20 22:51:37 Wait when oil prices go up, thanks to the deal Trump made with the UAE to end the deal with Iran.
3806 2018-05-20 22:51:10 Nothing to say in defense of bigot Douglas Murray? Silence? You are attempting to sell snake oil here. Do some research. 
3807 2018-05-20 22:51:04 How about raising gas and oil prices so Putin, Russia and Saudi Arabia make more money? How about screwing over American farmers and causing China to buy billions of dollars in soybeans and sorghum from Russia? How about bring a company that spied on us back in business (ZTE)?

3820 2018-05-20 22:49:46 Is air popped popcorn in coconut oil healthy? I cannot find a straight answer. #ilovepopcorn
3821 2018-05-20 22:49:34 ProTip: lemon and pressed garlic and a touch of mediocre olive oil.  Use part of it to marinate chicken, then add tahini to the rest as a sauce after grilling (kebabs make it grill super fast).  This has become a regular meal here =)
3822 2018-05-20 22:49:16 Getting coconut oil in your eyes is not painful, however, I’m pretty sure you can go blind from it since it took me 13 minutes to correctly type this tweet. I think.
3823 2018-05-20 22:49:09 Omg omg I still need to mess around with avocado oil!
3824 2018-05-20 22:48:44 you missed the point, american owners are in it primarily to make money, oil money is in soccer to win, make money vs spend money, sadly mistaken i really wish a sheikh had bought man utd and not the corporate raiders from america
3825 2018-05-20 22:48:39 Ha, fell sick because I averaged 12 hours of sleep for four days last week. If you have some essential oil, that helps. Just massage your forehead with it.
3826 2018-05-20 22:48:25 I think for traitorous acts by congressmen we should bring back "boiling-in-oil" as their punishment. A major deterrent if nothing else.
3827 2018-05-20 22:48:21 Deforestation should be reversed globally and palm oil industry discourage destroying forests
3828 2018-05-20 22:48:05 i’m going to new orleans next weekend and i can’t even eat a beignet bc my mom is forcing me to be dairy free, sugar free, oil free, & avoid red meat for the next two weeks !

Fucking olives, think you're so great cause you're the periscope of the sandwich. Just be oil you little bitch.

3832 2018-05-20 22:47:33 The true tragedy. An OPEC country rich in oil & gas has citizens robbing delivery trucks waiting in line for scraps or hunting local pets for food. They R christians so who cares right but western countries keep bringing in FAKE Syrian refugees completely brilliantly FUBAR!!
3833 2018-05-20 22:47:32 Lmfao when you sold them engine oil instead of transmission oil

3835 2018-05-20 22:47:03 I’ll change your oil. Just not your car’s oil.
3836 2018-05-20 22:46:57 My brother can change a tire, fix my brakes and change my oil but since he married n working I can’t always depend on him 
3837 2018-05-20 22:46:56 for my body I use a lot of dove and coconut oil products, suave coconut butter and shea lotion works real good ! facial wise... I use pure hand cultivated aloe ( been falling off lately) lol

3841 2018-05-20 22:46:25 I still think swedish massage oil is better than rubbing alcohol.

What do we expect when millionaires & billionaires of shady character, along with their cronies, who hold fabulous amounts of oil stocks (to name one thing) in their portfolios, get in high office?
3856 2018-05-20 22:44:01 Yeah, it's called karma. But I wonder why France still controls the currencies and oil in Francophone Africa? Why did Chirac say in 2008 “Without Africa, France will slide down into the rank of a third [world] power"?

3894 2018-05-20 22:38:06 Ignorant MAGAts swallow & parrot @FOXNews BS, but FACTS from @POTUS's own mouth: Papadopolous "is an energy & oil consultant, excellent" & "Foreign Policy Advisor". Traitor was indicted, pled guilty & cooperates w/Mueller. Regardless of @KellyannePolls' "Alt-Facts" BS, it's FACT.
3895 2018-05-20 22:37:59 My bad. Let me also list some other “achievements”
- oil prices rising due to Iran deal withdrawal, thanks to @potus Obama hatred. 
- Farmers suffering as China buys food from other countries.  
- Huge budget deficit when no wars or economic adversity.
3896 2018-05-20 22:37:48 Venezuela need to change socialism failed them. They should atleast do what China did mixing communism with capitalism it worked, for sure it can work for Venezuela since they are rich in oil

3902 2018-05-20 22:37:22 Yeah. Ya know, I didn't support the Iraq war and all the money spent on it and continues to be spent but... there was this thing called "oil for aid" and even when we created the need for aid... the exchange never happened anyway.

How much has AU spent on trying to secure oil?
3903 2018-05-20 22:37:16 Wow.. do you even pay attention to people that call this #russiagate and do you know that it's being used to silence progressive voices that speak out against the military industrial complex, big oil and wall street? OH THATS RIGHT, u do know that. #dncpuppet

3908 2018-05-20 22:36:56 It's one of the ones that called itself socialist but never really was. It has the largest oil reserves in the world but no means to refine it so it depends on foreign corporations, which goes against Socialism. And there's a lot of corruption/ outside interference.
3909 2018-05-20 22:36:44 This oil pen is so clutch
3910 2018-05-20 22:36:39 My grandfather helped build atomic bombs & wmds (mustard gas in case we needed it) Eventually he got a job w) Big oil. So, yeah. No negative impact from that in comparison to M-13, right?

3912 2018-05-20 22:36:32 Where can I get this frying oil from
3913 2018-05-20 22:36:29 G.E. bailing out of GREEN and investing in MINING and OIL. Their stocks lost half of the value under @BarackObama. NOW THAT'S FUNNY! Go Trump! #MAGA

3915 2018-05-20 22:36:21 I've been saying that about the Oil since there 1st, 1st overall pick. Picking 1st is easy picking outside of the top 3 requires skilled management, an area the Oilers have failed in for nearly 30 years.

3928 2018-05-20 22:34:07 Thx for the links but the snaps don't support your thesis. Re the coup, Mossadeq alignment with the USSR was exaggerated, ie. used as an excuse for the coup to reverse the oil nationalisation.  Not sure why CIA would be working with Khomeini having installed the puppet Shah.
3929 2018-05-20 22:33:50 Al’arrabiata! Sauté olive oil with equal parts freshly chopped chili, basil, and garlic. After two minutes (and before the garlic browns too much) throw in two cans of tomatoes, cook it down with a little water thrown in, smash it, and some salt and pepper. Presto!

3948 2018-05-20 22:30:02 Got my oil changed, gymmed, did laundry, did groceries. I did not do anything fun, I still feel like garbage, and now I have to make dinner for mom. (I'd be happy eating cereal, myself.)

3950 2018-05-20 22:29:46 To anyone who doesn’t know anything about cars, “0% oil life remaining” does not mean your car is out of oil. Please do not start pouring oil into your engine. It means you need to take your car somewhere to get your oil CHANGED. RT to save an engine
3951 2018-05-20 22:29:41 buying a moisturizer for oily skin is so difficult. you have to consider pores, shine, oil, sebum, pimples, existing pimples, shine, oh and OIL.
3952 2018-05-20 22:29:33 If you like potting soil that's thicker than oil, this stout will make ya shout! Especially the next morning when it comes back out.
3953 2018-05-20 22:29:31 Interesting. It isn’t like breaking up a company w/ physical assets like oil firms (just splitting up assets, doesn’t change profitability on a per-unit basis much).

But sharing data between units makes up much of the value here. They’re worth more together than total of parts.

Life for the bottom 3rd is extremely tough and men at the bottom get to also be labelled failures IF they can find crap jobs.
So the issue is, life is tough for men and women, but it's taboo to address the issues

3963 2018-05-20 22:28:38 Is Fleury headed for the Hall of Fame? If he wins the Cup this year I don’t think there’s a doubt. #nhl
3964 2018-05-20 22:28:22 Should I ignore increased spending, rising oil prices, rising prices for all goods, impending war, impending recession? How conservative would that be?

3983 2018-05-20 22:25:28 I guess I could see why you'd want to defend him though, considering starting Iraq War 2.0 exclusively for the profit of oil companies by preventing Iran from selling 3 million barrels of sweet crude a day like they were planning before we decided to start breaking treaties...
3984 2018-05-20 22:25:21 From what I have read.  Sauds need oil to be at $100.00/barrel in order to stay afloat.  The market is being manipulated. So much for the tax cuts.
3985 2018-05-20 22:25:15 You are on a tear of your own making son. I haven't told YOU to do anything; you are assuming. I couldn't care less how much pot you smoke or eat. AND you completely ignore that the study findings were that the oil (minus THC) is just as effective. My tweet was for EVERYBODY.

3988 2018-05-20 22:24:34 Canada only has pipelines to US, thus US is the only importer of Canadian oil. Canada sells its oil to US at discount because it's sell at discount or not sell at all. Canada is landlocked in terms of pipelines, not geographically,it has no access to tidewater to export oil.

4027 2018-05-20 22:19:06 Oh....Never eat Greek again. :( I think they use to much oil or something.... feeling so bad after it and cannot sleep because my mouth is sooooo dry. :(
4028 2018-05-20 22:19:02 I want crinkle cut fries without the oil 
4029 2018-05-20 22:18:58 If the mantra is get our oil to foreign markets, the EU makes more sense since it alleviates some of their dependence upon Russia and Gazprom. But the Maritimes would be advised to hold Feds and Industry to strenuous account on spill clean up and liability.
4030 2018-05-20 22:18:34 Their adamantine pillar dabbed in mineral oil rubbed against their hairy spunk dungeon
4031 2018-05-20 22:18:29 I straight just got back from the store & i got Bump Stopper. It's amazing! Mens razors, 5 blade, exfoliating, & baby oil are also helpful in preventing.
4032 2018-05-20 22:18:28 I need my oil changed, can you swing by ??
4033 2018-05-20 22:18:23 Is Melanie Olive Oil?

4036 2018-05-20 22:18:03 Your bio says it all.......better to keep quite & thought a fool, than open YOUR MOUTH & remove all doubt!
4037 2018-05-20 22:18:03 egg and yougart is healthy but PRATHA full with fat, high chlastrole,  unhealthy oil
4038 2018-05-20 22:17:57 I just know the basics like replacing brake pads, rotors, and changing oil. How long did that job take to complete?
4039 2018-05-20 22:17:53 I'm certainly no fan of lemmings like OWS or pussy hat wearing hipster-leftist-liberals with their 1000 gender snake oil. These are agent provocateurs to distract people from real issues and serve to discredit the left and there's equivalent 'flat earthers, nazis  on the right.
4040 2018-05-20 22:17:18 exit oil
4041 2018-05-20 22:17:16 I always love this time of the season, the chairman's interview, such a well spoken, passionate man! Who only wants the best for the club and fans! Any rival club should watch, so they understand he's not just an oil money Arab, who knows nothing about football!! #mcfc #chairman
4042 2018-05-20 22:17:12 It’s all pollution. You can’t cherry pick. Your saying plastic is ok. What about the 4 Texas size plastic island in the worlds oceans? Our Canadian oil industry puts a large amount of money into clean tech. So much so that we are world leaders. That changes when profit decrease.
4043 2018-05-20 22:17:01 Mandalay oil fields look remarkably improvised and rustic, often single families operating individual derricks ('Burma With Simon Reeve', BBC2).
4044 2018-05-20 22:16:59 Definitely getting an oil change tomorrow
4045 2018-05-20 22:16:40 Oh, stop. Pastors don’t sell snake oil. You are a FAKE & exactly the kind of person Jesus warned us about. Men who abuse their wives need HELP, not the patronizing they crave. Don’t walk — RUN from this sick man.
4046 2018-05-20 22:16:26 Yeah! There are a few dolls that've done that with with oil inside to replicate a lava lamp effect, and my favorite is Monster High's River Styxx, whose transluclscent limbs show the skeleton inside
It seems like a cheesy way to do invisibility but I love it???
4047 2018-05-20 22:16:09 As much as I LOVE the Stock Market $ES_F... I still prefer #Commodities > #Stocks. Specifically #Metals like #Gold $GC_F #Silver $SI_F & #Copper $HG_F. I also don't think #Oil $CL_F or RBOB #Gasoline $RB_F are done... Lastly, the #Grains: Soybeans $ZS_F Corn $ZC_F Wheat $ZW_F.

4054 2018-05-20 22:14:29 よう
4055 2018-05-20 22:14:27 Any vegetable/unsaturated fat oil (canola, olive, etc). Animal fats aren't as good
4056 2018-05-20 22:14:17 Vit E oil. I will almost swear by this.
4057 2018-05-20 22:14:02 We've joined the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to promote the use of sustainable palm oil, and are committed to only use certified sustainable palm oil in our own brand products. Thanks! 2/2
4058 2018-05-20 22:13:53 Hey there, environmental groups including WWF, The Forest Trust, & Greenpeace have advised us that banning palm oil is not the solution. For sustainability reasons, it is better to switch to sustainable palm oil than to other vegetable oils. 1/2
4059 2018-05-20 22:13:44 Lagi pengen banget bio oil buat ngilangin bekas luka. Pick me juseyoo ^^
4060 2018-05-20 22:13:39 Oga ooo..... you mean what happened thru oil would have happened to agric too,that means you don't understand the difference between them. I think you have forgotten that Agric is hard earned money by individuals not by large scale trade.
4061 2018-05-20 22:13:37 Try tea tree oil 
4062 2018-05-20 22:13:31 Mammy Maher: What the hell are you doing? *Pointing at both my active essential oil misters*

Me: I'm misting eucalyptus oil to help ease my sinus pain. Obvz, Mother!

MM: why do you have the other one running then?

Me: Coz I don't like the smell of eucalyptus 
4063 2018-05-20 22:13:28 The cost of a barrel of oil has gone from around US$60 a few months ago to around US$79 currently.  That accounts for most of the increase but the soon to be applied taxes will make it worse for the consumer as basically everything in the shops will go up in price.
4064 2018-05-20 22:13:19 おやありでしたー
4065 2018-05-20 22:13:02 Oil changed, transmission fluid flushed, new wipers, new tires, house cleaned, garden planted now I'm all ready for vacation Friday.

4073 2018-05-20 22:12:06 Olive oil is great for cooking, just not at a high heat. Many things require it.

Rapeseed is great too.
4074 2018-05-20 22:11:54 Well pro gap open for #ES_F 41 and then 50 zone are targets above.  OPEX behind us so on with trade wars, interest rates and OIL.
4075 2018-05-20 22:11:48 Where? If by “professionals” you mean nutcases and snake oil salespeople, then yes I am sure there is disagreement. We have to go with the preponderance of the evidence.
4076 2018-05-20 22:11:41 I wish I had somebody here to rub coconut  oil on my booty 
4077 2018-05-20 22:11:37 The whore was the ugliest thing I've ever seen.... God all mighty, I'm no oil painting but Jesus she was awful.
4078 2018-05-20 22:11:34 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
4079 2018-05-20 22:11:18 This lady asks me if we have time to do an oil change and I said I’m not sure because it’s not my decision and she asks me “what do you do then?” I’ll be the one doing your oil change idiot.
4080 2018-05-20 22:11:13 How many layers of paint do you apply for oil? Is it like base-Tonals- then details ? Or is it a whole process ?
4081 2018-05-20 22:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: sad crust with greasy coconut oil and arugula.

4086 2018-05-20 22:10:05 RT @LivingSafely: Cheeze-It this May? Its top three ingredients are flour, soybean and palm oil with tert-Butylhydroquinone.

4102 2018-05-20 22:06:57 How do all u munchkins think you got any of the things you use or own? Fossil fuels to make them.. fossil fuels to get them to the store. 100 million barrels of oil a day is what the world consumes. Saudi Arabia would execute u on the street.

4104 2018-05-20 22:06:46 Bollocks, is this money that makes you think like Trump or is this a natural progression of stupidity crossing the Pond like an oil slick?
4105 2018-05-20 22:06:24 Overdue for an oil change because same.
4106 2018-05-20 22:06:22 Somewhere in an attic there is a horrifying oil painting of @elijahwood that just continues to age.
4107 2018-05-20 22:06:11 Grapeseed oil is really pretty great. I use it a lot instead of olive oil.
4108 2018-05-20 22:06:09 Actually, in my area, Marcellus shale is fracked for natural gas. But underneath there is another layer called the Utica which will be fracked for oil.  So fracking is used for both.  And it is destroying the planet.
4109 2018-05-20 22:05:58 Ugh and here I’ve been injecting coconut oil into my veins
4110 2018-05-20 22:05:51 Last night @sadgrooves asked me if I had any oil and I said “like essential oils” and I’m just now realizing I am that guy

4121 2018-05-20 22:04:47 Pipelines are *way* cheaper than rail is to move this product. Opponents of the project fail to mention how happy oil producers will be to have access to transportation that’s a lot cheaper than the train cars they’re currently paying to use.
4122 2018-05-20 22:04:44 The problem i have is those against KM are directly impactING me and my family and every hard hour I have spent providing for them.  The oil industry will find supply elsewhere if not Canada.  So all the hippies are doing there best to stop the cleanest producers in the world

4127 2018-05-20 22:03:39 @BeautyChickee I have to do a 20 minute presentation on toxic waste and I found a picture of an otter in an oil spill and now I’m crying
4128 2018-05-20 22:03:35 ok guys serious question..how important is it for me to get an oil change? like my car won’t explode or anything right? or is this something I should put near the top of my list of things I need to do and shouldn’t procrastinate? 
4129 2018-05-20 22:03:31 oil...no fucks given
4130 2018-05-20 22:03:28 OMG ikr! The Note 8 without a case is like a fish dipped in oil

4132 2018-05-20 22:03:15 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
4133 2018-05-20 22:03:03 LOLOL. I KNOW that cutting taxes while increasing spending won't work. I know rising oil prices will make the price of everything increase. I know a trade war with China won't work. I know the Republican strategy never works. I know it ALWAYS causes a recession.
4134 2018-05-20 22:02:58 Stop the war!
Weekly oil price hike has to be managed. Focus on things that will help the consumers. #justsaying

4139 2018-05-20 22:02:06 Yes, nothing beats the Marcella sauce. I use both butter and olive oil, freshest tomatoes possible (TJ's campari are really good, or farmers market ones), garlic, a bit of onion if you want it. Julienned basil at the end.

4156 2018-05-20 21:57:56 Spiders HATE peppermint oil.
4157 2018-05-20 21:57:38 I flipped the pancake and it landed right into the oil, that's why x3
4158 2018-05-20 21:57:35 I sauteed a little bit of garlic in olive oil, then i threw the dandelions in there just for a little to wilt, and for like the sauce i did just some soy sauce and some squeezed lemon. 

Usually i do salt pepper, red onions, tomato and some like light olive oil tho when its quic
4159 2018-05-20 21:57:34 But but but??? You don’t see how decreasing traditional vegetables and increasing SSB, with a total net decrease in carbohydrates, while increasing seed-oil-fried meats ... exonerates sugar consumption? Bullshit graphology 101
4160 2018-05-20 21:57:32 My family had acres of land for a couple of generations and have since sold a lot (not all) of it to oil companies. We are euro ancestry; this is Oklahoma. I haven't researched how they got it because I kind of don't need to to connect the dots eh

4163 2018-05-20 21:57:05 Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, who married Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, worked during 11 years in the oil industry (Elf Aquitaine and Enterprise Oil). He took a stand on energy poverty.
4164 2018-05-20 21:56:56 Sounds like the heat might have been too high if oil was splashing out at ya maybe?
4165 2018-05-20 21:56:35 Have you tried magnesium oil or lotion? It is wonderful for muscle pain, and most of us are deficient. I hope you feel better

Dip her slowly into boiling oil.  Once your flesh burns off you stop feeling pain.  If you do it slowly they’ll feel every second of it.
4168 2018-05-20 21:56:17 Use our raw liquid black soap as a cleanser. It removes dead skin, oil, dirt and is great for acne prone skin, rough skin, dry, oily, & combination skin, sensitive skin, eczema, psoriasis and rosacea.
4169 2018-05-20 21:56:17 I’m old. I need to maintenance my hand. Where did I put that oil can?

4171 2018-05-20 21:56:05 I have that same problem at @SUBWAY . There’s a tip jar but I have to wait until the person is finished putting oil and vinegar on the sub. Then a Bell! Do I ring the bell? Or just tell them they made it perfectly and watch as I put the tip in the jar? #Screams
4172 2018-05-20 21:55:58 Oh and apparently I inherited mineral/ oil land in Texas. I only found out when there was a company that wanted to buy it from me @Freeyourmindkid
4173 2018-05-20 21:55:49 Monistat 7 takes 7 days to cure....Tea Tree oil takes one application.....we should spray Trumpster and Miller The Fuck Wad with a squirt.
4174 2018-05-20 21:55:37 The stupid always lash out at the intelligent. Usually on a phone they wouldn’t have if not for people much, much smarter then them. Screw them, they’ll be changing your oil one day. Congratulations, and good luck.

4181 2018-05-20 21:54:20 very much so! the noodles are boiled, the broccoli is steamed, the mushrooms and onions are sauteed in a regular pan which is then cleaned out for the egg. The sauce is soy sauce, sesame oil, sushi vinegar, and chili garlic sauce and all i do is mix and pour over. Easy!

4188 2018-05-20 21:53:18 Instead of banning wine I would have gone for the juggler right away  we are known as rednecks shutting the tap off and bring BC to an agreement then would have done many things an agreement on oil exports and shown don’t F with Alberta ban wine big f in deal

4190 2018-05-20 21:52:50 Started painting the cabin. As the previous owner never painted it during is 16 years as owner, we decided to use a tar infused timber oil. Seems to be the right choice, but my whole being now smells of tar...
4191 2018-05-20 21:52:14 Put 4 table spoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.

4193 2018-05-20 21:51:51 I get a raw chicken, add coconut oil, pulses, veg and water. Boil it up for a few hours then mix it with CPXtra mixer feed from CSJ. Maisy’s been fab on it for 4 years now x
4194 2018-05-20 21:51:45 The question is what percentage of Nigeria's GDP is from oil revenue? Oil revenue is way less than 20% of Nigeria 's GDP. Consider that in your analysis. 80% still came from Agriculture, Industries, Services, and others combined.
4195 2018-05-20 21:51:43 The company offices are no longer in Oil City, LA.  We have temporarily setup a PO box in Rockwall, TX.  We are actively seeking to find acceptable office space which works for incoming Officers and Directors.
4196 2018-05-20 21:51:42 I wonder who will get the credit when national debt increases because of decreased government revenue from tax cuts, increases in government spending, oil prices skyrocketing, the price of goods inflating, disposable income shrinking, and war starting.. Republican Economy.
4197 2018-05-20 21:51:35 Baby oil Is meant to be the best, leave it on for 30 mins and comes straight off

4201 2018-05-20 21:51:05 The Tyhee has some good numbers that in a recent article about gov revenues from oil. Hardly a pro business pub. BCLibs did a study under Christy Clark that showed movie industry was taxpayersubsidized. Study wasburied. Have friends inthe movieunions. Not asrosy as its told
4202 2018-05-20 21:50:43 Hugh Grant oozes charm, snake oil and is as smooth as Vaseline as Jeremy Thorpe #AVeryEnglishScandal a rum, almost an Ealing tale of ambition, calamity, farce and tragedy that young people might view as fictitious black comedy. It's real enough, very dark and grotesquely funny.
4203 2018-05-20 21:50:37 The drift away massage oil as it perfect to relax with leaving the skin so smooth
4204 2018-05-20 21:50:36 I actually know of several children that have been cured of cancer using Rick Simpson Oil which is a derivative of the THC in marijuana big Pharmaceuticals don't like people using this because they can't make money off it they'd rather have you take chemo and die slowly
4205 2018-05-20 21:50:08 Gotta luv coconut oil 
4206 2018-05-20 21:50:07 I agree that hysteria doesn't get us anywhere, but if Camille had any idea how embarrassingly off-base this idea is that man hasn't cooked the earth over the last hundred years burning coal and oil, she woud bury her head in a pillow for a month.

4208 2018-05-20 21:50:03 Brennan better ready himeself, they are going to throw him so far under the bus he will be able to tell us what oil is used to grease the axles!! Chum is in the water sparky and the sharks are circling!!
4209 2018-05-20 21:49:59 Love getting hot oil splashed in my retina at 5 in the morning !!
4210 2018-05-20 21:49:58 Coconut oil
4211 2018-05-20 21:49:35 I ended up getting the grape seed oil cuz it was on sale
4212 2018-05-20 21:49:14 @timandsid get over yourselves and call a spade a spade.  Jets weren't as good as you try to convince everyone they were!  Last year Tablot took the Oil far, this year he sucked.  Wait and see on Helly.  Could be another 1 and done.  Lots of whiff's this round.
4213 2018-05-20 21:48:59 He couldnt do that the past 5 years and now he can?  with what he is going to end the economic war? Even the oil production colapsed.
4214 2018-05-20 21:48:58 Oil and water
4215 2018-05-20 21:48:47 Have you used beard oil?

4218 2018-05-20 21:48:35 I guess I buy the one that is made with olive oil and a hint of lime and it's good lol
4219 2018-05-20 21:48:35 Should've had your doc use warm olive oil and massage...no tearing
4220 2018-05-20 21:48:27 Lmao you are fine I’d rather the info be out there. I take a CBD/THC mix for pain. The THC is much more effective for that. The CBD only is great for anxiety, insomnia, upset stomach. I have had zero issues with either of them. I use them in an oil because smoking or vaping are..
4221 2018-05-20 21:48:21 Gotta take both of my cars for oil changes this week.
4222 2018-05-20 21:48:12 This conditioner & oil mist I bought smells so mf good, gotta wash my hair with it tn 
4223 2018-05-20 21:47:38 Try use cetaphil skin cleanser instead of normal face wash for a while, makes THE biggest difference. Other than that avocado oil is v good, it’s heavier so it doesn’t disappear after being absorbed into your skin like almond oil or olive oil
4224 2018-05-20 21:47:38 #StopExportOfCrudeOil The Kenyan people must reject the idea of exporting crude oil, it's export will cost Kenya>jobs, development and deny Kenya cheap fuel @EAukot @ukhozi @fokango @MadiniKenya @GovernorNanok
4225 2018-05-20 21:47:36 Teddy Roosevelt is turning over in his grave. We MUST get Trump's bozo selloffs of oil mining parts of the Arctic Wildlife Refuge reversed.
I guess they don't have moving animals in his bubble world or in his gold lame' condo
4226 2018-05-20 21:47:36 Btw, Messi wins 5th Golden Boot, more than any other player

Recently analysed Messi/CR7 rivalry using the oil industry w/ a CR7 fan who thinks football is all about goals:

CR7 is like downstream (filling station)
Messi is like upstream, mid-stream & downstream all rolled into 1
4227 2018-05-20 21:47:33 i think i accidentally ate some of my oil paints??? that or i made a super shitty cake.
4228 2018-05-20 21:47:12 @EpsilonTheory Marc, when oil was in the low 30’s he had a theory that “we are in a period of permanently lower oil prices”.
4229 2018-05-20 21:47:01 About the same consultation if not more than the greens n labour did around no more gas/oil exploration
4230 2018-05-20 21:46:52 @MichaelAvenatti   i support you so far - but people are dying for trump$$ as you tease - many of us feel you can put an end to this - our kids abroad are in peril - oil prices rising to hurt the economy - jobs destroyed - allies lost - nation divided - war eminent - SPEAK OUT

4233 2018-05-20 21:46:32 Sadder still? Barebacking with a porn star, among many others, when you are married. No wonder he is so worried about the difference between HPV and HIV. That dipstick has gone in a few too many oil tanks.
4234 2018-05-20 21:46:29 No one wants to buy that shit. Too damn overpriced. Plus if you wanna be healthy workout, change your diet, and use coconut oil lmao.

4237 2018-05-20 21:45:46 Put diluted aloe on it. 1:1 water to aloe. Or try any oil you have and massage that into your scalp. Don’t go dripping onto my face overboard just enough to soothe your scalp. Also think about your diet and what you are taking in. Your body is possibly telling you something
4238 2018-05-20 21:45:45 By the way Zealot - it isn't nonsense, and it isn't mine either. It is the conclusion of a 16 yr study by PhD & MD plus staff & published in medical journals. I note you completely AVOID the central issue. The oil (minus THC) has the same MEDICAL benefit, but of course no high.
4239 2018-05-20 21:45:44 I’m more than convinced that Apple is in cahoots with the oil companies because Siri’s eminent lack of direction causes me to use more gas listening to her directions than it should. 
4240 2018-05-20 21:45:22 We've had 311 yrs of Union. We've had devolution since 1999. We've had our Oil squandered by WM. We're the only country to discover oil to become poorer the Union doesn't work for Scotland. It properly never did. #DissolveTheUnion
4241 2018-05-20 21:45:18 a fun game to play with Venezuelan “refugees” is to ask what their dad does for a living. Try it it rules, last time i asked I got “major oil company lawyer”
4242 2018-05-20 21:45:03 I was holding my three year old son at a parents for choice stall on Henry Street. Oil fella walked past me and hissed "you didn't abort him".

But, Y'know, both sides apparently.

And blah blah tone.
4243 2018-05-20 21:44:46 Use coconut oil to shave and then pat your pussy with a cold rag after, then put some white deodorant. You’ll be good 
4244 2018-05-20 21:44:40 it puts the swedish massage oil on, or, it gets the hose.
4245 2018-05-20 21:44:33 #StopExportOfCrudeOil Any attempt to justify import of crude oil ,based on narrow argument that imports will be cheaper than our local oil is ill advised. Processing our oil will create jobs here @EAukot @fokango @ukhozi @MadiniKenya @GovernorNanok

4249 2018-05-20 21:43:54 Jason Kenney seems like a boot kicker to oil corporations though so I see where you were going, just don’t give that POS credit when he’s just a cog in the wheel running over the working class of the world.
4250 2018-05-20 21:43:44 Ironically Alaska North Slope is also a bit more CO2 intensive than AB oil sands in the production side. Add in having to burn fuel to ship it and it's not making much sense but hey, who knows what goes on inside the head of an eco loon?
4251 2018-05-20 21:43:41 Bruschetta is literally only tomato’s oil and garlic on toast but by god it’s bloody tasty
4252 2018-05-20 21:43:40 Oil stains aren’t so bad. It’s getting everything put somewhere else for a while that gets you. Happy garaging!
4253 2018-05-20 21:43:37 If there was a functioning government could legislation sort out this ridiculous situation. Temporarily as an EU citizen can the oil be sought and prescribed in Donegal
4254 2018-05-20 21:43:37 QUESTION: Those of you who have oil diffusers...what are some of your favorite oil combos?
4255 2018-05-20 21:43:36 I’ve been mixing my body shimmer with vitamin E oil to keep it from getting streaky and as a result, a bitch is baby soft 
4256 2018-05-20 21:43:20 Laughable that Cons blame Wynne for world oil prices.
4257 2018-05-20 21:43:16 Hey Tacoma Fools why not protest ur Alaska Wildernesv Ocean Drilling or Alaska Oil Tankers sailing down Canada US coast daily. You know what you’re insane Pres Trump would do. You’re cowards protesting twinning pipeline when USA has 90,000 kms of NEW Pipeline in past 8 years.
4258 2018-05-20 21:43:11 If you dig deep enough you'll always strike oil, I guess
4259 2018-05-20 21:42:43 You bought the olive oil....didn't you? But the soft serve was so worth it
4260 2018-05-20 21:42:38 You can vape a cartridge right next to a disproving family and no one can tell. Distillates are just a bit more smokey and odorific, but none the less discrete. Flower when I can, oil the rest of the time.
4261 2018-05-20 21:42:05 Nigeria generally has the same save for a few industries. Oil & Gas and most recently power (which is by regulation and not even statute).
4262 2018-05-20 21:42:01 Just got home from a workout in the gym.
For dinner: fesh peas and diced carrots w/ wild rice and red beans in a sauce of olive oil, butter, vinegar, hot sauce . Served over a lovely broiled cod fillet. Life is sweet. Now no mention of tRUmp till after dinner! And dishes cleaned!
4263 2018-05-20 21:42:00 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
4264 2018-05-20 21:42:00 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4265 2018-05-20 21:41:52 You’re not allowed to even use a tablespoon of coconut or olive oil? Oh naw... that’s all you. Lol
4266 2018-05-20 21:41:50 Castor oil???
Conditioner??? 
Any link for me to read more about that???
4267 2018-05-20 21:41:49 Tea tree oil will be a part of my skincare regimen for the rest of my life. No lie.
4268 2018-05-20 21:41:18 So announcement of sanctions put back on Iran along with further sanctions on exports like oil so their government feels not only isolated but struggles financially. Just that or should we expect further & more extreme action?
4269 2018-05-20 21:41:16 yeah right, lets not get involved and give them the means to keep shooting their missiles, Lets make peace and help each other, i am all for talks. beats sending Dennis Rodman over there . U see Obama's mess he made. Clinton oil deal did well. NOT

4273 2018-05-20 21:40:58 so much for opening up the oil fields to increase production and lower costs.

2. Lower fuel/ cost of energy
3. Develop Turkana county

4276 2018-05-20 21:40:36 Well what to do then? Let’s keep fighting. This battle has been lost, but I hope , war will be won at the end. Biggest enemy is high oil prices. That is where we have to concentrate the most to win the war.
4277 2018-05-20 21:40:14 The idea put forth by POTUS and others in control of the wealth and power that all we need is more coal and oil, more of our slaving at the bottom for not even a living wage, more of business and gov't as usual,  is strictly a big lie and hoax meant to keep the rich ...
4278 2018-05-20 21:40:11 Needless to say that Imo state is an oil producing state. 

Palm can fund fund without needing the federal allocation. Wealth can be created, industries will thrive where we are.

4282 2018-05-20 21:39:51 Libya has the world's 9th largest crude oil reserves. Libya has more crude oil than Nigeria.
4283 2018-05-20 21:39:49 I've read with cats you can rub the oil from a tuna fish can on them and they'll clean each other and become friends. I don't know about trying that with such a large dog and a tiny kitten but it might work.
4284 2018-05-20 21:39:35 well, after 2 more SP3s, I'm going to spend the rest of my oil on trying to get Columbia cool girl.
4285 2018-05-20 21:39:32 bio oil dah try?
4286 2018-05-20 21:39:28 I’m ready to return to cooking with oil.
4287 2018-05-20 21:39:24 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
4288 2018-05-20 21:39:24 Washington state gets their oil from Alaska by tankers off the BC coast. Horgans argument against KM gets wierder eveyday

4293 2018-05-20 21:39:03 America doesn't even have legit "capitalism". We have an oligarchy run by bankers and oil barons who have locked up the most significant channels of commerce for their own benefit.

4295 2018-05-20 21:38:54 Wrong Sarah, The world needs more energy than ever, and it’s not feasible that oil is not any where more in Australia than where it is now, such as Bass Strait. No major spills reported, there, nor will it be so in the Bight. So drill, drill, drill, NOW.
4296 2018-05-20 21:38:49  Raise oil prices? Where were you last 8 years? Or under Bush? You need to stop following the drivel that cnn tries to push onto you. There's some of us that isnt so blinded & remember last presidents. #Clueless
4297 2018-05-20 21:38:19 Soho is where a half dozen eggs is $6 and olive oil is $38.
4298 2018-05-20 21:38:18 Carter is an idiot. He said we would be out of oil by the year 2000. Famous speech about it.
4299 2018-05-20 21:38:12 The irony is fantastic. A bunch of whinny liberals sitting in plastic (petroleum) kayaks protesting oil. Get a life.
4300 2018-05-20 21:37:57 Nice!
4301 2018-05-20 21:37:57 It's no longer business as usual. No more blood money, no free more oil, no more arms money, etc. Shame on you!
4302 2018-05-20 21:37:55 whoever starts the arguments , lets stop pouring oil into the fire
4303 2018-05-20 21:37:51 Soon come my brutha #Believe
4304 2018-05-20 21:37:43 I usually use olive oil for frying.
4305 2018-05-20 21:37:37 I got rid of my acne because of the face oil I used, it's local one (I'm from Indonesia anyway)!! yes maybe! I hope you get rid of it soon
4306 2018-05-20 21:37:35 Did you brush it and oil it beforehand?
4307 2018-05-20 21:37:35 To also use peppermint oil on those leaves after you pulverize them. I actually got this tip from a mother who is not vegan but who doesn't like to use chemicals because of her child. Go figure!
4308 2018-05-20 21:37:20 Trouble with Cameroon there's no top 10 oil reserves otherwise you would have world war three happening lead by the Americans, bitter sweet
4309 2018-05-20 21:37:17 Which one are you trying? We’ve enjoyed blue apron. They never expect us to have anything besides olive oil salt and pepper
4310 2018-05-20 21:36:58 Imagine socialists controlling the pipe that ships AB oil. Throttling volumes. Setting artificial prices. Staffing with socialist partisans. Wheat Board all over again.
4311 2018-05-20 21:36:52 In the future historians will also show that Ryan was a snake oil salesman who sold economic policy for the 1%. He was an empty vassal for the Koch bros and the NRA
4312 2018-05-20 21:36:42 But they are ok with US bound tankers plying the same waters a couple dozen miles away? How come US charities funding anti oil protest in Canada aren't doing the same in the US?
4313 2018-05-20 21:36:20 #StopExportOfCrudeOil Why is Jubilee government hell bent in exporting Crude oil then import refined oil? Does this make economic sense?
@EAukot @fokango @JAKADAWA
4314 2018-05-20 21:36:02 How about we don’t give a shit about how @brianklaas thinks?
4315 2018-05-20 21:35:56 Not when the oil and gas powering electricity, yes still knocks 4 tonnes a year off the 13 tonne (worst in EU) footprint per person; but what's your solutions to moving from current worst in EU to leading position?
4316 2018-05-20 21:35:04 I prefer sunflower oil!
4317 2018-05-20 21:35:03 RT @LivingSafely: Cheeze-It this May? Its top three ingredients are flour, soybean and palm oil with tert-Butylhydroquinone.
4318 2018-05-20 21:35:03 None of that is "politically correct" topics but policy differences for a common goal.  I've seen what both coal and oil industries can do for communities economically and environmentally.  I've also seen what the introduction of alt. energy brings. Many many more jobs for starts
4319 2018-05-20 21:34:54 Oil we need one for bo3 8s
4320 2018-05-20 21:34:53 So I'm going to tell you that when you look for ant remedies on the internet you will find many but the only things that really deter them without killing them or peppermint leaves and peppermint oil, everything else is garbage and I tried everything else so I know
4321 2018-05-20 21:34:45 Zorvazar is a grotesque bee-titan with traces of turtle. She is wary of oil refineries.
4322 2018-05-20 21:34:44 Next time, just to be safe, you can use cooking oil as a temporary fix until you get food grade lubricant.
4323 2018-05-20 21:34:28 might be time to talk #oil again
4324 2018-05-20 21:34:27 So Ngoma  @iAmNgoma says he's sipping Red oil #AllLesDay while Calculating .

4326 2018-05-20 21:34:21 Open mind even on Dossier 
That majority of it quite possibly true
Including the Rosneft oil part
Where there so much evidence
Just short of a smoking gun
4327 2018-05-20 21:33:59 Kenya should build an oil refinery in Lokichar and abandon the thought of exporting crude. Export of crude oil amounts to export of jobs overseas. #StopExportOfCrudeOil
@EAukot @fokango @JAKADAWA @GovernorNanok @MadiniKenya
4328 2018-05-20 21:33:50 I just used a joint paper to blot the oil off my face... 

What has my life become?
4329 2018-05-20 21:33:33 Be alert with int'l. envoys... I doubt Uzbekistan is the causation... more like Anglo-Persian or BP Oil and really Roman descent and cohorts most criminal causing Cuban Embassy Style U.S. Diplomat more than sound, body and mind issues with the brain only.  Secret Service DEW's.

4338 2018-05-20 21:32:52 So continue to send that oil through those pipelines. Or any other pipeline for that matter. They aren’t protesting plastics, or pipelines in general. They’re protesting this specific pipeline they don’t want. That you can’t seem to grasp that is shocking
4339 2018-05-20 21:32:44 I think it was not paid to Iran because of sanctions.india payed all other countries , right ?.BJP had protested against oil prices b4 2014
4340 2018-05-20 21:32:43 i cant tan no matter how much i try, im honestly considering  spraying cooking oil or something on me 
4341 2018-05-20 21:32:33 Shave with the grain, add lotion and argan oil, let it sit for a bit, run area under warm water to open the pours back up, apply shaving cream, go against the grain. Apply lotion and argan oil again and enjoy your smooth skin.
4342 2018-05-20 21:32:28 One of my favorite summer salads has olive oil, chick peas and feta and a bunch of other stuff; I call it “Greek Salad.” I’ll get you the recipe if you want it! 
4343 2018-05-20 21:32:18 Oil changed, lawn mowed, and workout all complete before 5 today. Sunday’s are my favorite
4344 2018-05-20 21:32:16 Commodore Perry’s intervention in Japan was actually the original war for oil (in this case it was the whale variety)
4345 2018-05-20 21:32:12 - Where do you want me to give you the oil? We are near the coast...
- Head for Jupiter and unloaded it there, that part is not monitored Rex.
4346 2018-05-20 21:32:11 The oil and gas industry is scared as fuck of Tesla right now. I believe they are paying news outlets to publicize one Tesla crashing out of 30 million.
4347 2018-05-20 21:32:02 People who sniff lavender oil spend more time kids spend using digital devices, the less likely they are to call out a fraud.
4348 2018-05-20 21:31:49 Someone come oil my scalp
4349 2018-05-20 21:31:49 You think the country with more oil than anywhere else slipped under the radar?
4350 2018-05-20 21:31:26 The same way that "WATER" and "OIL" dont mix.

"LOVE" and "COMMON SENSE"dont boil in the same pot.
4351 2018-05-20 21:31:19 Maybe he'll fuck with oil next
4352 2018-05-20 21:31:17 Coconut oil is like the devil for me lol. I use masks almost every time I wash my hair  
4353 2018-05-20 21:31:17 Getting ur hair dried after applying pear with olive oil is an extreme sport 
4354 2018-05-20 21:31:13 People that fry dodo with palm oil are right up there with people that break egg in their indomie. They are cold blooded psychos
4355 2018-05-20 21:31:05 Well I don’t know where you live but we never had it less than $2.50. I’m telling you it has nothing to do with any sitting President. They don’t control that. If they did, my chemo would be a heck of a lot cheaper. It’s the oil companies. We need to not buy from other countries.
4356 2018-05-20 21:31:04 @StephenNolan Medicinal Cannabis oil is available in The Netherlands. Your guest should bring her child there...
4357 2018-05-20 21:30:57 i’ve recently started replacing olive oil w vinegar bc it makes cucumbers taste nicer

4362 2018-05-20 21:30:00 I wasn’t talking about electricity, just a general comment on oil use increasing with increasing economic activity
4363 2018-05-20 21:29:58 The man with the @Oil_well_money 
4364 2018-05-20 21:29:56 All Indigenous Groups along the pipeline twinning route have signed on. The others are simply $ jealous. No money for them. Odd how these people get all that time off work to protest. Alberta’s only oil export is to USA & BC drives to USA & buys gas made from Oil. BC Logic 
4365 2018-05-20 21:29:39 So completely ignorant.  We’re already destroying the Earth through coal, fracking, and oil. For money. Make millions now while destroying the world for your grandchildren. Greed meets ignorance.
4366 2018-05-20 21:29:32 I make my own cbd oil for my dogs when they get the nervous bellies and it works like a charm. I'm sure everyone has given you remedies but I couldn't resist.
4367 2018-05-20 21:29:25 You weren't alive when @McDonalds used a different oil formula. Ask them about that sometime. The modern fries are 50% as awesome of what they used to be.
4368 2018-05-20 21:29:04 You're ignoring the fact they havent broken with capitalism and the devastating effect of the crash in the oil market and US aren't exactly making things better Inflation was/is massive,and element of a planned economy has been last lifeline. But go ahead with simple sound bites

4371 2018-05-20 21:28:43 He's a demented old fool, and remember he and many of other 'journalists' make a nice buck off working for the oil and gas industry. And that's fine, but don't pretend to be unbiased.
4372 2018-05-20 21:28:12 Definitely, I always use that instead of oil to cool my chicken.
4373 2018-05-20 21:27:56 Baby oil. From dead babies.
4374 2018-05-20 21:27:48 The pains of cooking! I like to use my wrought iron skillet, issue being that it needs a lot of heat for that CRUST... makes for way worse oil splash if the meat's very moist or got any water on it. :D
4375 2018-05-20 21:27:40 Hugo Chavez was taken out by CIA & one of the richest oil states in the world has food crisis?
4376 2018-05-20 21:27:21 And import their oil and support them all while being told to mind our business
4377 2018-05-20 21:27:12 So sell them any of the countless things made from oil instead of insisting on building a pipeline and forcing them to accept the potential environmental damage from a spill.
4378 2018-05-20 21:26:56 Government and smart r like oil and water
4379 2018-05-20 21:26:53 i have scarring from my eczema. coconut oil not gon help.
4380 2018-05-20 21:26:30 Of course I can't make pancakes without having oil splash onto my hand and give me a burn.

Of course.
4381 2018-05-20 21:26:27 Ugh but it's sooo good though! It's those fries fried in peanut oil

4393 2018-05-20 21:23:53 Inaction by govt on solar & wind & hydro means energy costs rise, our c02 impact rises and more than 1 in 4 goes into fuel poverty. Globally 50% of investment is going into solar. Just Ireland failing in policy implementation despite rising oil /energy costs & worst-in-EU results

Palm oil, palm oil.
4410 2018-05-20 21:20:42 Makes sense Americans are funding the activism to shut in Alberta Oil, Elizabeth May is an American who is anti-Canadian Oil but pro US Oil.  Meanwhile the BC NDP will do anything to cling to power, including the destruction of the CDN federation, if that’s what it takes.

4413 2018-05-20 21:19:40 Transport is majority of our C02 footprint, right? Oil is heading to $100 by Q1'19 which will see homes consumer costs rise €1k a year (2bn cost impact to homes which put 20,000 jobs at risk in retail & tourism), and govt won't push EV's as it's 2bn of duty to dept of finance.

4416 2018-05-20 21:19:30 In all fairness to the Orange Bloviator; gas prices are rising because the oil producing countries throttled production to end the glut that had brought the prices so low previously. I don’t recall any action on his part that made the difference. Am I wrong about that?
4417 2018-05-20 21:19:18 Instability in the Middle East, Is the main reason for rising oil prices.
Who is creating instability in the Middle East?
#US
4418 2018-05-20 21:19:03 Delete what? A tweet calling you a 15 year old? Mentally you seem even younger. Start thinking about which team you'll shift to when oil runs out in Dubai.

4421 2018-05-20 21:18:24 Understand price of crude oil in intl market affect price. But why patrol prices didn't go down when crude oil was less costly?
4422 2018-05-20 21:18:20 I trace the problem to the Reagan era, when a 3-fold drop in oil prices duped a generation into believing GOP policies were effective.  2007 put the lie to that, but decades of Fox/Limbaugh propaganda blocked an immediate pivot Left, leaving nowhere to turn but Trump fantasy.
4423 2018-05-20 21:17:56 Simple minds look at simple answers,  oil prices rose after 2008 because of the economic recovery taking place in the US. They collapsed in 2014 (Obama yrs) because of increase global production and China cutting back. They are now rising only because of DJT incompetence.
4424 2018-05-20 21:17:50 Today mark a yr I ff ya,  you didn't ff back...... Hmmm.... Ff Engn.
4425 2018-05-20 21:17:50 I don’t believe that, libs always say that whenever a republican president is in office. But either way, I don’t care what Europeans think about us!
4426 2018-05-20 21:17:29 The Increase in oil prices is because OPEC has cut output three times. And Russia agained to limit its increases. This was done to increase the price. Which it did. The US however has steadily increased its production
4427 2018-05-20 21:17:27 I can’t wait to, one day, have enough money to pay someone to put coconut oil on my back bc I can’t fucking reach
4428 2018-05-20 21:17:18 Allah Ya yarda
4429 2018-05-20 21:17:15 Just plain vegetable oil (Canola is good). You need a flavorless oil with a high smoke point.
4430 2018-05-20 21:17:03 I gotchu. I'll bring the coconut oil
4431 2018-05-20 21:16:53 So crude prices plummet with OPEC production stable, US and Venezuela increasing exports to keep per barrel price down. Demand did not suddenly increase. What increases was the possibility of a significant disruption in crude oil from ME that is driving futures prices up.
4432 2018-05-20 21:16:51 We have a Government who only solution to deal with the financial deficit due to falling oil prices is to TAX the population and get rid of social services.... this shows that they have no vision..... #TrinidadandTobago

4434 2018-05-20 21:15:36 You may be a Republican but if you front see all the conservative policies being enacted and agree with them I don't know what to say. USA doesn't control the price of oil supply and demand do, basic economics
4435 2018-05-20 21:15:32 The reality @jmoore541|, which I think you know, is that US has no intention of leaving Syria and will keep generating excuses to stay forever. We have only been ‘protecting’ the majority of Syria’s oil and arable land from ISIS.
4436 2018-05-20 21:15:27 I’ve changed my pill too which has helped immensely. Drinking lots of water definitely helps (I struggle to remember sometimes tho). For the scarring I recommend Rosehip Oil or just good old Lavender Oil. I’ve read about Bravura Dermaflannel too, going to try that. xx

4442 2018-05-20 21:14:34 Which had nothing to do with a 70% increase in oil prices, the "oil shock" of the 70's, or deregulation. You misunderstand anyway. PRIVATE banks create new money when they make loans, the big 5. Digital 'credit' doesn't need to be printed, BofE still prints and mints money.
4443 2018-05-20 21:14:26 2nd option. Now when Germany receive Russian oil safely, its price for Poland and Ukraine surges. Russia can blackmail these countries with no consequences. "Obey or we cut off our oil". This pipe is a catastrophy. Almost everyone can see it. 2/2

4479 2018-05-20 21:10:05 Actually most of it has been proven true. So far Trump has raised gas and oil prices making Putin, Russia, Saudi Arabia, etc. much richer. He has fewer farmers and China is buying billion he of dollars in soybeans and sorghum from Russia. He has done nothing to help America.
4480 2018-05-20 21:10:04 in the very moment Russia doesn't need to transfer oil through Ukraine they can invade their country with no remorse. Their biggest sheild was Russian oil flowing to west. That won't be a case when Nord Stream 2 is fully operational. Many more dramatic scenarios are available 1/2

4576 2018-05-20 20:59:51 Dems here hate us too. We’re good with it.
4577 2018-05-20 20:59:47 Coal is not clean.  Solar and wind power are clean.  You are a moron and you are tied to the coal lobby and the oil lobby, and all the idiots who only listen to you repeated mantras don’t bother to take the time to learn the truth.  The only thing you are draining is decency.
4578 2018-05-20 20:59:42 Oil drilling and fracking don't effect where wild animals roam. Have you ever seen a modern oil well pad, it's just a few acres per pad and when removed properly you can't tell it was ever there.
4579 2018-05-20 20:59:38 - exercise ya lips LMAOAO to exercise your lips all you have to do is smile, kiss or whistle  do these everyday 
- massage your lips! take any oil like coconut oil or olive oil and just massage your lips w it for 5mins. don’t wash it off tho just let it absorb into your lip so
4580 2018-05-20 20:59:22 i support you so far - but people are dying for trump$$ while you continue teasing - many of us feel you can put an end to this - our kids abroad are in peril - oil prices rising to hurt the economy - jobs are destroyed - allies lost - nation divided - war emminent - SPEAK OUT
4581 2018-05-20 20:59:16 What you need to support solar energy. This country need to promote and support the solar energy. Secondly how to minimize the terrorism and ISIS? We need to concentrate using gas and electric vehicles at least will decreased buying oil and fuel in middle East.
4582 2018-05-20 20:58:57 Yup same thing we use , all Cantu & alittle extra virgin olive oil 
4583 2018-05-20 20:58:42 @EileenHubler Thanks for sharing re: canola oil! :)
4584 2018-05-20 20:58:39 There's an instance, I seem to remember, of the expression "una mar d'oli" (a sea of oil / an oily sea), meaning extremely calm and flat, in a very famous text by Santiago Rusiñol.
4585 2018-05-20 20:58:26 As long as nations accept payment in dollars the new oil exchange standard works in favour of Wall Street.
But as soon as they switch receipts to other currencies the system not working to the American elites advantage as Iraq Libya #Syria have discovered. Less so Iran & Russia.
4586 2018-05-20 20:58:15 I think only to oil king
4587 2018-05-20 20:58:13 Just from face-shaving experience, some cream and a lot of patience with the blade. Another commenter said "baby oil", which sounds pretty effective 
4588 2018-05-20 20:58:12 Lol, I called a friend last week to see if she would know where lavender oil would be in a store, because she works there.
She (or her boyfriend, tbh...Idk), inboxed me at 4 am to tell me to respect their relationship. 
All I wanted to know was where the fucking lavender oil was.

4591 2018-05-20 20:57:45 Hope you don’t get run over by the 2 oil tankers a day leaving the US Coastal waters while you protest another countries products.
4592 2018-05-20 20:57:35 Coconut Oil isn’t an oil, it’s a wax. Stop putting that shit on your face.
4593 2018-05-20 20:57:34 i ordered a kilogram of coconut oil n it’s coming tomorrow n i feel like it’s Christmas Eve
4594 2018-05-20 20:57:29 - lip scrub to exfoliate your lips: ingredients you’ll need is white or brown sugar, honey and olive or coconut oil  mix these ingredients in a brown and then add the mixture into a small container and boom you have your lip scrub! (ig:selfcaremoods)
4595 2018-05-20 20:57:16 You saturate the oil in cotton (small sponge, piece of cotton cloth) and insert into the vagina (using like the IUD).
4596 2018-05-20 20:57:13 He’s trying to pin it on maduro and get Chavez off the hook. But Chavez had run it into the ground and was borrowing money from China. A country rich in oil had to borrow and inflation was sky high. Unbelievable. McDonnell is lying to claim it wasn’t socialism.
4597 2018-05-20 20:57:01 That palm oil fried akara with one large crayfish inside it is nasty and Benin people need to quit it.
4598 2018-05-20 20:56:51 Great idea.I'll try it too. I also bake my samosa's. Instead of samosa pastry I use tortilla wraps. Cut them in half, shape them like a samosa, fill them, brush them with oil and bake. Divine...
4599 2018-05-20 20:56:48 Member asks

Hi.  I was hoping someone would know a store I could get some Cbd oil that works. I am purchasing for a friend with severe pain that wants off the opioids and such. Thanks
4600 2018-05-20 20:56:45 When I got my licence it was 65 to 75 cents a litre and that was expensive. Last time we saw these prices, oil was up to 100 dollars a barrel. It's not even close to that. We are just be fleeced
4601 2018-05-20 20:56:44 21 feels like the dent some asshole put in my front end this morning. With an essence of the sound of the hot sizzle of motor oil pouring on hot pavement.
4602 2018-05-20 20:56:40 Self-preservation and security for one's own family over country.
A few million goes a long way.
$1TR in dirty RUS oil $$=$100M x *10,000*
(not even counting China, Qatar, etc.)
More than enough for broad-scale treason.
Time for @GOP to double down!
#followthemoney #Corruption
4603 2018-05-20 20:56:15 Some traders believe Oil prices will go up to $300 a barrel in a few years! Well, last time it was $147 a barrel to crash the global economy ... and we have no EV ...
4604 2018-05-20 20:56:14 Equal parts of white wine vinegar and olive oil gets water marks off wooden tables etc
4605 2018-05-20 20:56:13 You mean every single time you fry plantain, you fry with palm oil? 
4606 2018-05-20 20:56:10 i just know that ka 5% of oil in Turkana is alot.
4607 2018-05-20 20:56:07 To the oil industry
4608 2018-05-20 20:55:51 A person found intoxicated must be given a large dose of castor oil by a local doctor and failure to gulp it down will result in a fine (TX)
4609 2018-05-20 20:55:41 - exfoliate your lips! just like cinnamon and peppermint oil it helps improve blood circulation so that your lips can be plump and bigger, exfoliate your lips 2x a week 
(ig:selfcaremoods) 
4610 2018-05-20 20:55:20 死んでなければ
4611 2018-05-20 20:55:19 Plan to teach her to change oil too.
4612 2018-05-20 20:55:18 If my voice would matter, then many would hear, it's not merely follow the $$, it's about follow the oil, which leads to $$. Putin, Trump, Exxon, Qatar, + more have a deal going on that is about oil & Trumps $ laundering via properties & post presidency.
4613 2018-05-20 20:55:13 Part of the big picture plan was also dt and all buying 19% of Russian oil..when our country runs out of oil we will be forced to buy it at top price. Makes sense why they don’t back other forms of energy.

4616 2018-05-20 20:54:56 30% participation from the report I saw. But does the Venezuelan government care? And with the young having left the country and the old people left behind, does it even matter who wins? Save for fate of the oil reserves, of course.

4618 2018-05-20 20:54:34 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.
Proverbs 21:20 KJV
Father, keep me from a heart of greed. Make me to know the proper balance between saving and spending.
4619 2018-05-20 20:54:34 Please keep doing what you're doing. I work in a cancer registry, and have a coworker who believes ALL cancers can be CURED with CBD oil and homeopathy. There are loons all around; don't let them bring you down. Keep fighting the good fight! 
4620 2018-05-20 20:54:34 Sure do. It’s going into the shop tomorrow. I’ve had to wait for the part to come in so I’ve had to continuously add oil every week and not drive too far. It’s been greaaat
4621 2018-05-20 20:54:27 If corn oil is made from corn, and vegetable oil is made from vegetables, what is baby oil made from?

4623 2018-05-20 20:54:17 As for comparing Celtic to city?
Never would I do that as I know city have superior players.
No wonder with the billions spent by that club.
Yet they couldn't beat Celtic over 2 games.
Not bad for a club playing in a so called pub league.
Without oil money city would be nothing.
4624 2018-05-20 20:54:13 if you don’t have cinnamon oil you can use cinnamon powder , all you gotta do is mix it with coconut or olive oil and apply to your lips for 5-10 mins and then wash it off (:
4625 2018-05-20 20:54:06 Great to see Portia :) And I would love to submit some of my art to her. I am an oil painter and I love her business concept! 
4626 2018-05-20 20:54:02 You must’ve been hit w/ some anointing oil today
4627 2018-05-20 20:53:50 Morgan Stanley: "our economics team estimates that close to one-third of the tax cut benefit to the US consumer may have already been removed by the rise in oil and gasoline prices."
4628 2018-05-20 20:53:46 Exfoliate before, never use a blunt razor and always change the head, sudocreme/coconut oil after to prevent/treat razorbumbs and avoid wearing rough underwear/jeans xx
4629 2018-05-20 20:53:43 Tea tree oil. It kinda stinks, but it will deter mosquitoes.
4630 2018-05-20 20:53:31 Where are your financial statements? What are you hiding behind? The NRA?? Big oil? Big pharma? All is collusion!!
4631 2018-05-20 20:53:24 @Stevie_Miller I finally bought some CBD oil and used your code, can’t wait to try it out
4632 2018-05-20 20:53:21 You see, those kayaks are made from oil that once travelled through a pipeline. Using them to protest a pipeline (while completely natural, renewable indigenous-made kayaks could be used) is hypocrisy at its finest.
4633 2018-05-20 20:53:08 Looked too much like our pp for the oil. Pass, pass, more pass and fail!
4634 2018-05-20 20:53:08 Lets get honest, Canada will be a good Boy Scout while fossil fuel demand increases for the next 30 years. Canada will sacrifice $100 million per day of revenue that could fund our schools, our hospitals and our economy in order to import Venezuelan and Arab oil. Stupid or what?
4635 2018-05-20 20:53:08 Omg!!! I believe gas prices were at over 4.00 during O's Admin! Was that his fault? WH doesn't set gas prices. Oil companies do so if this is DTs fault, those ridiculous 4.00 gal prices was O's fault!!
4636 2018-05-20 20:53:06 cinnamon oil: as peppermint oil does, it helps improve blood circulation so your lips can be more bigger and more plump just mix 1-2 drops of this oil to vaseline or lip balm and apply to ya lips 
4637 2018-05-20 20:52:54 A friend who broke her neck serving in the armed forces has been on 3 slow-release tramadaol for many years now. She finally plucked up courage and tried CBD oil, and now reports she's down to 2 tramadol per day.
4638 2018-05-20 20:52:53 Griddling is another option, prefer mine steamed, but love a griddled avocado with a splash of chilli oil.
4639 2018-05-20 20:52:51 สนใจครับ
4640 2018-05-20 20:52:24 I found pine sol in the cupboards next to the olive oil. WE ARE ONE CALL AWAY FROM THE POSION CONTROL CENTER, JANET!
4641 2018-05-20 20:52:23 Wrong... Midnight Oil. Hahaha
4642 2018-05-20 20:52:18 I saw this play while waiting on an oil change @FirestoneTires the only good experience I had  while waiting.1.5 hours to get an oil change
4643 2018-05-20 20:52:16 Does anyone know where I can buy CBD oil in town?
4644 2018-05-20 20:52:03 Not the most! Only those who want to keep their privileges and surrender to US interests. The Americans want the Oil of Venezuela just like they got the one from Brazil. With a Coup! USA are the biggest and most powerful villains in the world!
4645 2018-05-20 20:51:44 oils to plump ya lips:
peppermint oil: it helps as a lip plumper as it improves blood circulation, it might irritate your lips a bit but iz good! you can put it on directly or mix it in with your fav lip balm or vasline (ig:selfcaremoods) 
4646 2018-05-20 20:51:41 #DreamJobBzz, #BiteSizedBzz
My dream job before life happened was to be a chemical engineer. I could see myself in a lab coat in an oil refinery testing samples.  I ended up with a lot of college chemistry under my belt and a home bakery!
4647 2018-05-20 20:51:41 Oh okay, don’t worry Anna I will definitely not drink the olive oil salad dressing. I think for me when it comes to salad I’m more a ranch, Cesar, or balsamic dressing or blue cheese kind of guy when it comes to salads.
4648 2018-05-20 20:51:20 So I had less than a teaspoon of oil in Betsy  I’ve failed as a car owner
4649 2018-05-20 20:51:18 Oooor Groundnut oil saves the day.
4650 2018-05-20 20:51:13 Did some reading and realized there really is no such thing as a "healthy" fat. :T oh well. I guess the old saying is true..everything in moderation. Its just a shame I put olive oil on everything so I guess I have to cut back a lot.
4651 2018-05-20 20:51:12 Remember that David didn’t have to go out looking for the anointing; the oil found him. Destiny found Gideon hiding behind a box. Ruth didn’t desperately pursue a man; Boaz found her. Destiny found Joseph in prison. When you remain faithful God's Divine Destiny will locate you!
4652 2018-05-20 20:50:41 You should try Neroli & Avocado oil :) it has a lot of natural vitamin E in it and it’s VERY stimulating to ur cells:):)

4656 2018-05-20 20:50:02 walking into the shower with ur moss green fake tan guide colour on and hair saturated w/ coconut oil, only to emerge as a golden brown silky-haired butterfly 
4657 2018-05-20 20:49:52 it should't, but if you're anxious about that then you can get some tea tree oil which is what i use to treat my acne
4658 2018-05-20 20:49:40 How quickly does water evaporate in different conditions? Outside, by a window, in a cupboard, in a fridge etc Do other liquids evaporate? Vegetable oil? Vinegar? Ethanol? etc Which evaporate quickly and which slowly - Why?
4659 2018-05-20 20:49:38 I dry my hair only with old T-shirts. i put coconut oil on my scalp, the tresemme curl gel on, & then this Garnier curl mask on it. Scrunching it after & then diffusing it. It’s a long process  & then I do hair masks every now & then!
4660 2018-05-20 20:49:37 They hate and despise everyone they can't patronise - Corbyn & his middle class coterie of pseudo-intellectuals  are-- every single one - traitors to both their country & the working class they  claim to represent. Snake oil salesmen - proper scum
4661 2018-05-20 20:49:17 American Coup on Amazon is a great lesson Scotland post #ScotRef should learn from Iran’s history. British controlled Iran’s oil and hid the true wealth. When Iran’s democratically elected Gov nationalised oil, Brits planned invasion that US blocked! But Embargo & Media used!
4662 2018-05-20 20:49:12 Sorry to break it to you, but unless there's 65oz of oil dripping from it, it isn't a pakoda.

4665 2018-05-20 20:47:43 The fact that his website’s store looks like a snake oil salesman’s stockpile makes me find it crazy that anyone could support Alex Jones.

4669 2018-05-20 20:47:10 Given the inability or unwillingness of Libyan authority to deal with the inequity created by the control of hard currency supply, I suggest the sale of an equal share annual oil hard currency income to every Libyan at the official exchange with zero commission & control
4670 2018-05-20 20:46:57 I tried that one semester, level 3,I didnt study throughout Ramadan, n I fell sick immediately d exam week,it was disaster fr me
4671 2018-05-20 20:46:46 Chef Skinner cut up some tinsel, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with toothpaste.
4672 2018-05-20 20:46:44 Frustrating indeed. If the NDP are going to be against pipelines and oil supply in general then the best way to fight them is by lowering the demand for oil, if there’s no demand then there’s no reason to supply it. They should be going hard on EVs to reach their intended goals.
4673 2018-05-20 20:46:37 Can't cream with palm oil when your Vaseline finishes in the middle of harmattan though.
4674 2018-05-20 20:46:37 Are you this reductionist?? I use Petro products because the structure of my society literally forces me to, I can't get on a glass bus that runs on corn. This argument is absurd. I can disagree with Over usage of oil and want alternatives. Theses are not synonymous.

4679 2018-05-20 20:46:18 Actually Rosneft. Russia needed oil above $70/bbl to stop their economic freefall. Trump bails on Iran Deal and presto!  Exxon just got lucky.

4682 2018-05-20 20:45:52 it never ceases to amaze me at the level of sheer bigotry that liberal feminists freely exhibit.  Its as if their female parts do all their thinking for them...
4683 2018-05-20 20:45:51 use coconut oil!!!!! also use hair masks in the shower
4684 2018-05-20 20:45:30 I’ve been using avacado oil to grow my hair & Alx I’ve been seeing good results. & on a side note it has no odor.
4685 2018-05-20 20:45:29 Oil pen coming in dumby clutch
4686 2018-05-20 20:45:28 I'd have boiled the plantain & then made pepper sauce with the red oil. Not fry it in the oil. Jeez! 
4687 2018-05-20 20:45:26 Sorry to hear that about your mom. I am 83 today and gave a long talk to a friend on the benefits of LCHF for health and coconut oil for the brain. She remarked on my ability to recall facts. Keep trying, I can vouch for 
remarkable results.
4688 2018-05-20 20:45:18 don't works well on me. Already try both, acne and oil control. Both 
4689 2018-05-20 20:45:11 Can't decide if I want to put tanning oil or bug spray on
4690 2018-05-20 20:45:01 #IHerebyDemand that you don't get to call it peanut butter if you put anything but peanuts and salt in it - really! Palm oil?! Sugar?! Hydrogenation?! Fuck off imposters!
4691 2018-05-20 20:44:42 Yea right, just trust the oil companies won't use it? Alberta has proven it will take almost no royalties to move their dirty dilbit. Why wouldn't they further reduce royalties to make the movement of their dilbit more cost effective? This would put us at the mercy of Alberta.
4692 2018-05-20 20:44:41 What's the Crude Oil Prices in international markets
4693 2018-05-20 20:44:29 God. I suspect it's because eggs don't have character. Palm oil forces them to try to have a personality and it never ends well.
4694 2018-05-20 20:44:28 Venezuela largest proven oil reserves.
Since 1973 oil has become the new gold exchange standard
Americans shit scared to revalue gold in the past.
Big producers then were SA and Russia.
Oil production spread among nations.
Some friendly like Saudi Arabia others not so like V.
4695 2018-05-20 20:44:11 Fabulous Niamh! Still loving the Anti Aging Oil!! Its lasting me so long too
4696 2018-05-20 20:44:10 Thank you, I like it too 

Loool you should, I think it makes people look so adorable!

I find that gel is drying and leaves my hair brittle, so I use an oil glaze instead, it's not as lasting but it's better for my edges
4697 2018-05-20 20:43:59 You don’t protect us, you only protect assets. Such as oil!  We don’t thank aggressive narcissistic countries like the USA. You were late to world war 2 because there was nothing in it for you. But you must have ‘your guns’ lol
Let’s be honest. America sucks.

4704 2018-05-20 20:42:46 The US wants Venezuela's oil this is why the US has sanctions on Venezuela , the US is trying to bring down the country and then they will get the oil .. no we will never let that happen , long live Venezuela and the socialist dream..!
4705 2018-05-20 20:42:46 Champions League isn't even that big a deal money wise now because the TV deal is through the roof. Fact is though TV money is same for all, it's the oil money that's the big problem when keeping am even playing field. We were set to be top dogs for years til Abramavich appeared
4706 2018-05-20 20:42:39 Piece of shit article leaving out inconvenient facts, US cheated and reneg on agreements and deals... Clinton never delivered nuclear reactors and oil/fuel always missed the deadline for when it was suppose to arrive.
4707 2018-05-20 20:42:35 @CNNPolitics @KellyanneOnReliableSources Kellyanne reminds me of the snake oil salesman....full of sauce and won't shut up.
4708 2018-05-20 20:42:35 He knows what to do if he truly means peace,he's the architect of the rift,you bend an iron while its still hot.
4709 2018-05-20 20:42:22 When SNP where kids they where spoilt brats , No means no and you cant always get what you want 
what do we have oil , oh that's only like at £80 a barrel , was more then double that 5yrs ago
4710 2018-05-20 20:42:08 It looks delicious. My son and I are making homemade kimchi and used red pepper flakes like that(no oil.) We're improvising a bit. Hope it comes out ok.
4711 2018-05-20 20:42:06 Organic argan oil, freshly pressed from the finest Argonauts.
4712 2018-05-20 20:41:59 An oil painting
4713 2018-05-20 20:41:49 Enviros: We are addicted to oil and shouldn't be increasing dilbit exports 300%
Cory:  But you use oil
Enviros: Sure, but we are talking about increasing dilbit exports 300%, not current usage
Cory: Hurr durr hypocrites!

Try harder Cory.
4714 2018-05-20 20:41:42 That popular, scary looking dodo ikire is plantain fried with palm oil, eh? People have told me how it's so tasty and this and that but thank you very much, it is not me that will willingly accept talisman from you.
4715 2018-05-20 20:41:22 I probably will! Oh, and their last race of the year is pavement at IRP...er Lucas Oil. Will need a pavement guy for that. Hint hint
4716 2018-05-20 20:41:06 Burning gear oil, unless its my own.
4717 2018-05-20 20:41:02 Life isn't a scientific study. 

Big fan of canned sardines. Canned wild salmon not so much, but that's just preference. 

I try to buy them packed in water with the guts still included (deheaded & finned). Olive oil second. 

No idea if labels are accurate. I assume not.
4718 2018-05-20 20:40:52 While some mmight choose Burzynski for their child's brain tumor, others might choose CBD oil with high THC concentration--not the synthic versions.
4719 2018-05-20 20:40:52 Aw this is cute af oil but you must have got the dates mixed up with something else cause we didn’t meet until like September, we can still celebrating it tho cutie

4721 2018-05-20 20:39:43 Driving this week through Richmond, CA (home of Standard Oil), I saw regular for $4.05 a gallon.
4722 2018-05-20 20:39:16 Do you support ISIS and other radicals? I don't hence why I would prefer Energy East to displace oil from some of the worlds most corrupt nations. Let's make money from oil to pay for cleanup.
4723 2018-05-20 20:38:34 if u don’t send me a pic of yo damn coconut oil
4724 2018-05-20 20:38:32 Gas/oil pipelines have proven to be dangerous in many ways, especially to wildlife

 The Mountain Valley Pipeline (#MVPL), planned to cut through a national forest, is being built as of this tweet! #NoMVPL #NoDAPL #NoACPL
4725 2018-05-20 20:38:30 Millionaire yet greedy! Enjoy your oil money
4726 2018-05-20 20:38:16 We must not let capitalist america get there hands on there oil we must fight US sanctions..long live the socialist dream ....!

4728 2018-05-20 20:37:46 How high will oil prices go if Trump slaps economy-wide sanctions on #Iran and #Venezuela? It depends on whether their export markets (China and the Asia-Pacific) comply.
4729 2018-05-20 20:37:20 lumibalm is launching its first facial skin care products 

B.A.E face balm - is an acne fighting face balm that will leave your face feeling dewy and moisturizing, with the healing properties of Shea, Tea Tree and Rose Hip Oil just to name a few, be prepared to glow
4730 2018-05-20 20:36:57 I don’t recommend trying to walk up a metal staircase with water and oil all over your shoes because there is a high chance of death
4731 2018-05-20 20:36:44 #Modi Govt has 4m 2014, have had exorbitantly high oil prices despite very low price in the int. market. Even if the prices have increased now, which of course isn’t true, the govt has earned a lot in the past. 

Shouldn’t you share this benefit with the people of India now?
4732 2018-05-20 20:36:43 looking into personal essential oil diffusers?????????
4733 2018-05-20 20:36:34 I just read that Alberta is on the hook for 45bil over the next while to deal with orphan wells. Doesnt speak too highly of how big oil treats others. Truth be told, its fucking dismal.
4734 2018-05-20 20:36:24 
4735 2018-05-20 20:36:08 ABSOTRUMPINGLUTELY
4736 2018-05-20 20:36:00 I feel like I’ve just been punched in the stomach. Wow... So disappointed. What’s the point of even voting when the parties that run on the environment are actually worse than the pro oil parties?
4737 2018-05-20 20:35:58 As a man, you use engine oil.
4738 2018-05-20 20:35:48 Right here Trump gives industry whichever regulations they want abolished.  Acts like Pulin and his oligarchs. Oil, gas, coal, chemicals -all will give money & support him.

4742 2018-05-20 20:35:17 Just got offered to buy a Cadillac CTS 06 for like $5,000 with massive engine issues and oil leaks.
4743 2018-05-20 20:35:15 Yea a bit i guess
4744 2018-05-20 20:35:06 Why should we (people of BC) accept all the risk for this dirty pipe and end up trying for decades to clean up after Albertans and Texans? If dilbit can be cleaned up out of seawater still has to be determined. And big oil doesnt have a very goid record of cleaning up
4745 2018-05-20 20:34:57 Mr moon you walk upon the water,
You shine like oil on machinery,
You’re sharper than a knife,
And I’ll love you all my life,
Don’t leave me here alone,
Please take me with you.

4747 2018-05-20 20:34:51 breakdowns of 'Matilda', this is the good journalism stuff

I would humbly request next topic - unsafe policy of NASA in Armageddon

sending oil drillers into space?  was there no oversight here?
4748 2018-05-20 20:34:50 Every thing you say is spot on, though i doubt we can compete with City’s money without the Glazers, their money is Middle East oil money and there is a never ending supply, key is buy for a system and you can’t do that changing managers every two years
4749 2018-05-20 20:34:45 I love fired chicken..but it's horrible for you..that breading sucks in all that oil and the chicken if good is soaked in Brine before coated and fried...Sodium and Fat and the bad fats are all over that food...Still love it but limit myself to once a month or so.
4750 2018-05-20 20:34:42 aye, gave me the bloody nasal spray i bought from boots. i am onto an albas oil spray at the moment.

They’re often simply a personal choice, one in which I’ve chosen not to indulge.

4755 2018-05-20 20:33:54 “You waited this long to get an oil change?” “Why ya boyfriend didn’t take ya car to get the oil changed for you” 

STFU and change my sticker please
4756 2018-05-20 20:33:52 Changed the oil in my John Deere then I freaked it
4757 2018-05-20 20:33:28 @NEWS1130 report with @RogerMcKnight “so-called market forces” aka the big vague area so-called gas analysts use to excuse companies for price gouging. Big oil loves self-fulfilling prophecy thanks to shills like @GasBuddyDan where on earth is investigative reporting?
4758 2018-05-20 20:33:27 Science is scary! Let’s ignore it so oil companies can get a few more. Ents per share this quarter. Your proud ignorance is astounding.

4760 2018-05-20 20:33:14 Tried a new hair mask and !!!! I hate it !!!! Gave it two chances and each time it dried out my hair. 0/10 Back to banana and coconut oil masks
4761 2018-05-20 20:33:10 Pro tip: Prepare your tofu with olive oil. It's that much easier to scrape it into the trash as you get a steak out
4762 2018-05-20 20:32:39 I put spearmint oil in the mop water when I mopped the kitchen and now the whole apartment smells so nice! Like gum!
4763 2018-05-20 20:32:37 Samson has just smashed my new bottle of castor oiln that stuff is long to clean. I want to cry.
4764 2018-05-20 20:32:30 #italian #viagra does not work. what is italian viagra you say? hot pepper oil. do i have to eat the whole jar?
4765 2018-05-20 20:32:28 Even when you use really good skin care and actually keep up w it more you break out alittle bc your face is adjusting to the new chemical balance of your skin and dirt and oil that’s deep in your pores starts to come out which form new pimples but they go away it’s a process
4766 2018-05-20 20:32:21 Whilst mooching about in Manchester’s achingly hip Northern Quarter this afternoon I was delighted to get a waft of Patchouli oil from a small group of girls tripping past in their massive DM’s. #LongLivetheHippy
4767 2018-05-20 20:32:16 Isn’t it ironic how the military is deployed always at the “end” of a disaster after the local folks did all the heavy lifting? And we sure hope our Feds have enough brain capacity to give our military bill to the big oil corps. Or is this what carbon tax is used for?
4768 2018-05-20 20:32:14 It doesn't need a drop of oil ?
4769 2018-05-20 20:32:11 Imagine falling in love with someone, only to find out they fry plantain with palm oil.
4770 2018-05-20 20:32:03 I shall enjoy this with a can of Beavertown Neck Oil IPA (not discounted, but I’m not so price sensitive in this aisle).
4771 2018-05-20 20:32:01 Just as turkana demanded ashare of the oil what happens to other counties like mombasa should demand a share from the port applying the same principle
4772 2018-05-20 20:32:01 And their corporate welfare received is in excess of $3BIL. Now why would an industry making the kind of profits that big oil does, get any kind of subsidy whatsoever? Why should we (can taxpayers) give another $4Bil to a project for a dying industry?
4773 2018-05-20 20:31:56 Thank u bro
4774 2018-05-20 20:31:28 Mmm, asparagus. @deb_horm makes it all the time with garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper. Soooo good!!!
4775 2018-05-20 20:31:20 We are in transition from #fossilfuels, #Alberta is shuttering #coal plants, put in a #carbontax, & is making #oilsands more efficient. #Oil revenue is fianancing that transition. 
UK not ready to go off oil yet, & much of your's comes from North Sea.

4777 2018-05-20 20:30:58 This is a good one, it goes p fast for how many ingredients it has. In a large frying pan heat:
2 Tablespoons oil
1 tablespoon cumin seeds
--Heat until fragrant 
1.5 tablespoon garlic
1.5 tablespoon ginger
2 cup onion, finely chopped
--Sautee until onion is browned.

4778 2018-05-20 20:30:51 Oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil and more oil.
They have us over a barrel (of oil!!).

4787 2018-05-20 20:30:03 To select a healthy cooking oil, look for expeller- pressed or cold-pressed oils to ensure you are buying high-quality, undamaged oil. Oi...
4788 2018-05-20 20:29:46 I’m already a fan of Liz Earle Cleanse & Polish, but not heard of Naobay before - I’ll check it out. I agree that organic & natural skincare is the way to go. I love Trilogy Rosehip Oil too. xx
4789 2018-05-20 20:29:33 Entire India economy rest on oil prices

Its not just about oil. Its about overall foreign control on our economy, employment, media and big sections of Indian (Muslims).
4790 2018-05-20 20:29:31 htc oil 
4791 2018-05-20 20:29:23 Just working backwards. 40% of oil is for vehicles. Roughly half of that is personal vehicles. Roughly half of vehicles are trucks/SUV’s. (10% of oil consumption) Now remove those and replace with vehicles twice as efficient = 5% reduction.
4792 2018-05-20 20:29:22 They seem to have forgotten what they are protesting.  
-Anti-oil? Not today, we’re using the stuff
-Property rights?  Not today, we are squatting in cardboard boxes devaluing Burnaby property 
-1st Nations’ rights? Wrong again, my DNA test isn’t back and that Crey guy WANTS TMX

4796 2018-05-20 20:29:01 You see the problem now..
You praised the Govt  that depleted Nigeria Foreign Reserve in the years of oil boom that Qatar used to increase their fortune..
You are deriding the Govt that is trying to achieve so much with so little we didn't do in the days of boom..
Define abobaku?

4799 2018-05-20 20:28:20 They're doing olive oil tastings at the Giants game... I'm all for culture, but what happened to this game...
4800 2018-05-20 20:28:15 Believe me I am not pro Oil I prefer renewable sustainable energy like wind or solar but mining or oil extraction to me the same thing
4801 2018-05-20 20:28:11 Oil king rashid is crazy and fast 
4802 2018-05-20 20:28:05 Moroccan oil is the best product that’s out there. You heard it here (probably not) first.
4803 2018-05-20 20:28:03 No. You're speaking broadly, I'm speaking specifically about the oil Seun was referring to. That isn't groundnut oil.
4804 2018-05-20 20:27:29 Why are you like this 
4805 2018-05-20 20:26:51 @jjhorgan so you want to keep buying foreign oil ok I get it you do not want to support your own country because it’s not about tankers like u claimed or oil spills as so many tankers use the straits so give me one reason to support BC cause I can’t find one
4806 2018-05-20 20:26:47 E si strucca con il Baby Oil... 
4807 2018-05-20 20:26:47 Oh of course. I wanna burn all the oil, but, you know, it’s just not feasible. Smoke ‘em if you got ‘em.
4808 2018-05-20 20:26:47 True that it is an alternative for crude oil. But hydrogen leakage is not detectable and inhalation will cause death in no time. I think we should look for safer alternatives.
4809 2018-05-20 20:26:41 all americans need to research and read (BLACKSTONE /BAYROCK IND.) and trumps debt to russia and why they helped get #TraitorTrump elected, it shows everything that is going on right now, with rising oil prices and his debt being relieved and sanctions not being imposed #Traitors
4810 2018-05-20 20:26:39 The use of palm oil is a crime against nature.
4811 2018-05-20 20:26:29 Your hair looks lush, how long have you been natural ? I may give it go I use castor oil with t444z
4812 2018-05-20 20:26:18 Visited Patenegra 57 for dinner earlier (fine dining restaurant) .  There were some Irish people in.  They wanted sea bass  "with chips and none of that garlic sauce stuff"... is your oil Spanish, is the wine Spanish".  I almost cried, the waiter was so gracious and polite 
4813 2018-05-20 20:26:00 Beef tenderloin with foil wrapped potatoes and asparagus drizzled with sesame oil! #DockerDays
4814 2018-05-20 20:25:40 Tbh I wasn't going to do this but as far as frying plantain is concerned palm oil > vegetable oil.
4815 2018-05-20 20:25:39 Watch the film “Virunga” on Netflix. It lays out the problem as well as some great solutions to stop the oil companies.
4816 2018-05-20 20:25:32 Good news for the Oil and Gas Authority - yon company registered in England and Wales.
4817 2018-05-20 20:25:29 @ReedTimmerAccu do you change the oil on the dominators every 2,000 miles?
4818 2018-05-20 20:25:27 But really I go through all these chefs cooking and all I see is protein , vegetables and a lot of ororo. Y so much oil.
4819 2018-05-20 20:25:18 Olive oil always makes it better.
4820 2018-05-20 20:25:14 Not just that

Vatican Bank too

And Nehru Gandhi ecosystem

But worse are Hindus who demand Hindu cause and cheap oil on odd-even days

Do you know why Pakistan and Bangladesh are Islamic nations? Because entire Muslim population stand behind that cause.
4821 2018-05-20 20:25:07 Wanted so bad to do my new garage but within the first month I had oil stains and boxes stacked to the ceiling lol.  
4822 2018-05-20 20:25:07 For the face? Been using the Nivea soft face cream for years, I supplement it with Argan/Jojoba oil and sunscreen
4823 2018-05-20 20:25:02 Fujimura only lost games against Oil King in the entirety of Top 8 at #Stunfest2018, he swept everyone else clean

Incredible
4824 2018-05-20 20:24:57 Dude commercials drive me nuts. 

Hey boomers, you don’t need Nugenix. Stop eating carbs you fat bastard. Eat some raw garlic. Take some fish oil and Arginine. Throw around some heavy weights. Run some intervals. Drink some scotch, and listen to Frank Sinatra. 

You’re welcome.
4825 2018-05-20 20:24:55 It is, by the way, the best time for them to stick it in, whilst the #EU is on the back foot & flirting with #mullahs in #Iran to keep them in power for few more days for little bit cheaper #oil & frozen #billions oil monies. #Brexit
4826 2018-05-20 20:24:55 When Qatar was saving and increasing their Reserve for 5 years of oil boom, somebody was depleting Nigeria Reserve in that same 5 years without adding a dime to it....
Shouldn't such demon be in Jail before we compare Nigeria and Qatar?

4840 2018-05-20 20:22:44 @narendramodi all of western cost of India is full of oil and as the slope is towards middle east it flows away.
4841 2018-05-20 20:22:37 Nothing short of war is gonna fix it, either civil war or one by a third party. I wouldn't be surprised if that dipshit @AmbJohnBolton would call for regime change to get at their oil. For now they are stuck with their poopootov cocktails
4842 2018-05-20 20:22:34 I use essential lavender oil for many things, one of which is to mix water with a bit of lavender oil and use as an air/fabric freshener. I would not spray on silk fabrics. You may also use this mix in a small bottle as a facial refresher to keep in your handbag.Look up lavender!
4843 2018-05-20 20:22:34 That could have been a few bucks right there. Oil is cheap, engines are not. You’d surprised what other dumb stuff people do to their cars.
4844 2018-05-20 20:22:28 Vegetable oil is not groundnut oil. Nice classification thing there tho.
4845 2018-05-20 20:22:27 Damn. You can still come over tho. I got the baby oil and the bubble bath is running...
4846 2018-05-20 20:22:20 Deep conditioned my hair, did a hot oil treatment, and twisted her up! That only took 3 hrs 
4847 2018-05-20 20:22:18 ... forget the deal already.... you right next to the two biggest oil markets in 21st century... India and China.... let the EU and US drill for their own oil.... just make sure you have a nuclear deterent otherwise you will go the route of Libya, Iraq,  Afghanistan and Syria...
4848 2018-05-20 20:22:16 Not to be confused with Dennis "Oil Can" Boyd...
4849 2018-05-20 20:22:13 Infil is doing infinitely worse at blocking Ibuki than Oil King: surprising!
4850 2018-05-20 20:22:12 Trump has so much real estate in their heads lol
4851 2018-05-20 20:22:03 When u wanna treat your hair right but all the oil keeps running down your face and neck 
4852 2018-05-20 20:22:03 This week I have scheduled my eye exam, an oil change, and a tattoo. Go me. Now to actually go to a fucking doctor....
4853 2018-05-20 20:22:00 Watching today and holy Larsson covers up for all his mistakes.. Bad pinch by oeL, 3 on 1, Larsson saved it.
4854 2018-05-20 20:21:58 U know I also eat pakoras with or without oil and don't feel guilty at all...it's worth a breaking dieting rule
4855 2018-05-20 20:21:56 I really should get an oil change but I don’t wanna get up from bed, and I wouldn’t have this issue had my stepdad taught me all this shit when I asked him to 3 years ago.

4860 2018-05-20 20:21:25 Refine the resources in Canada.  Much more jobs, more returns to Canada and less environmental risk.  Not what the foreign oil cpy’s want to do as they already have refineries elsewhere.  They’re best interest is not ours.
4861 2018-05-20 20:21:24 Do you realise how much influence Wahhabi lobby carries? Will Hindu gives up oil imports for the hindu cause? Do you how many Indian works in middle east? There are many issues. Modi understands what we believe but acting upon is easier said that done.

4864 2018-05-20 20:21:12 Gasoline, fire, water, and oil move a car
4865 2018-05-20 20:21:09 Pretty sure you are going to see 2005 again. Gas price will continue to rise because OPEC are raising oil prices.
4866 2018-05-20 20:21:09 Don't forget the boiling oil.
4867 2018-05-20 20:21:09 No, they managed to tow it and had new oil put in, but it was very close to completely running dry.
4868 2018-05-20 20:21:08 Soon the “journalists” @CNN and @MSNBC will be going from town to town in a wagon, selling snake oil.

4871 2018-05-20 20:20:55 I guess we're lucky to have had the cuts, seems like oil is almost always over priced.
4872 2018-05-20 20:20:55 Same old same old

今朝気づいたんですけど、うちのユニオン軽巡極まりすぎてサンルイ用の低燃費編成できそうなのがいないんですけど_:(´ཀ`」 ∠):

あと、ローン用の100exp/oil編成できましたけど、そんなに奇抜じゃないのでみなさん興味無いですよね( ＾∀＾)
4876 2018-05-20 20:20:37 Vic: “it would be a shame if the olve oil and vinegar got cold before the bread came out..”
4877 2018-05-20 20:20:31 So shameful. We could have great health care for EVERYONE if we had a govt who cared. Instead we have CROOKS getting their pockets deeply lined by ins companies & big pharma. Along w/ the others like the NRA & oil companies etc. Just appalling
4878 2018-05-20 20:20:17 A huge thankyou to the guy who came to help today when my wheelchair wheel fittings collapsed, and effected a repair which got me home, and I hope the oil came off his hands OK.
4879 2018-05-20 20:20:15 Flaxseed oil in pill or liquid form, Tumeric, and apricot seeds.  The seeds need to be refrigerated.  They are bitter unless chased with water while chewing.  NO SUGAR diet!!  Sugar is like drugs to cancer cells.  I've had cancer in the family.  LOT'S OF RESEARCHING!
4880 2018-05-20 20:20:10 @susanma, lovely to meet you - your @TropicSkincare hair smooth radiance oil smells heavenly 
4881 2018-05-20 20:19:47 Follow the money seems good advice. Trump's actions only make sense when we learn how much he will personally make. With Iran is he cutting their oil exports to raise the price of oil for his backers Russia, Saudi Arabia. Wonder what U.S. oil companies have also paid in bribes.
4882 2018-05-20 20:19:43 Neither. I've had very nice cars - people think yourcstuck up. Plus - the insurance and upkeep is disgusting. My 350 SLK AMG cost $600 for an oil change! Plus - high carbon gasoline. It was a mortgage payment on wheels no one could live in. Buh bye.
4883 2018-05-20 20:19:31 Most European countries haven't really ever liked us all that much. 
But they also have a pungent superiority complex so...
4884 2018-05-20 20:19:24 I've run out of my Argan oil .
4885 2018-05-20 20:19:24 Hot dogs can be fancy! I make bulgogi dogs!  Gochuchang, sesame Oil, soy sauce, brown sugar glaze, on a bun with shredded cucumbers lettuce and mayo!  Then I add a bit of sambol oleke!  delicious!
4886 2018-05-20 20:19:20 Ice cream with essential oil’s, that’s why it’s six bucks a scoop
4887 2018-05-20 20:19:19 Vegetable oil is even made from red oil, groundnut oil is gotten from groundnut and its meh.
4888 2018-05-20 20:19:07 Have you eaten puffpuff fried in palm oil before? You will leave your family and wander into the streets because nothing will make sense anymore.
4889 2018-05-20 20:18:57 Thank you!
4890 2018-05-20 20:18:51 Also, 1000cr rs Congress didn’t pay to Iran againt oil n gas purchase which was paid by Modi govt. another point, please check the subsidy given by UPA. It was huge. Modi govt reduced that to minimal.
4891 2018-05-20 20:18:39 With the publication of the growth commission report coming up the moon howlers are in full swing. 

We are having a crypto multi currency oil backed sterling  pegged fixed floating convertible scottish euro dollar block chain.

Apparently. ....
4892 2018-05-20 20:18:34 2 river cleanups, the one Chavez boasted about in 2006 that didn't materialize and the later one - the Inter American Bank lent vzla $300,000,000 in 2012 for a cleanup but it's still a river of sewage and toxic chemicals. Now Vzla is supposed to be repaying China loans in oil 2
4893 2018-05-20 20:18:30 As an American who does travel abroad I am not seeing the responses this weak bladder fucker does.  I deal with either businessmen or the military.  They are much happier than with a communist.
4894 2018-05-20 20:18:23 I was in an all-night diner downing cup after cup of coffee that tasted like engine oil when a new message from BB got me back on the track.
4895 2018-05-20 20:18:19 The game of "Tel (Oil)" is going on in India. 
The current moves in the game are: +1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1
The moves near election will be: -1-1-1

4896 2018-05-20 20:18:18 we are extracting more oil then Saudi Arabia but oil is priced as a global resource and the fear irans oil supply will be cut off because of withdrawal from iran deal as well as recent refinery explosions are increasing price

4899 2018-05-20 20:18:02 #wiredbackpage  Budget slashed. No oil. Aching joints.
4900 2018-05-20 20:17:58 anyone want a free oil change i gotchu 
4901 2018-05-20 20:17:56 You can add that one to the emolument clause violations piling up. Trump is in for personal gain and to help his rich oil buddies. Might rate a hotel or golf course thrown in for good measure as well.
4902 2018-05-20 20:17:47 Me telling my father about my cbd oil discovery. Him: idc if you smoke weed just not at my house
4903 2018-05-20 20:17:45 Well, I was surprised that Drones will be assigned for oil facilities instead of to fish out these these criminal elements that are unleashing sorrows, tears and blood against helpless Nigerians.
What is our scale of preference again?
4904 2018-05-20 20:17:39 Z Tobą? Niemals. Ale jak jaka Francuzka tak by mnie w  langues d’oïl zaświergotała...
4905 2018-05-20 20:17:34 has it helped with any scarring?! that’s my main problem although rosehip oil and spf have been helping tremendously!! i still like exfoliating but don’t like physical ones lol
4906 2018-05-20 20:17:20 My Abu site keep repping
4907 2018-05-20 20:17:19 If Alberta can cut off oil to BC, can't we like cut off access to our shipping ports? LOL
4908 2018-05-20 20:17:15 Also, don't forget the US exports more oil than we import.
4909 2018-05-20 20:17:13 I'm getting an oil change
4910 2018-05-20 20:17:07 Farrukh you said it. The setup cost for solar and wind power may be high, but input cost is zero. Our governments are run by oil, coal and importers lobby

4912 2018-05-20 20:17:06 Why is palm oil an option? Ew.
4913 2018-05-20 20:16:51 Oil and gas?
4914 2018-05-20 20:16:38 Naw B. Have you tasted groundnut oil? Did you like it? The problem is you. You have to believe me.
4915 2018-05-20 20:16:31 weed oil in my thirteenth house
4916 2018-05-20 20:16:31 Oil change
4917 2018-05-20 20:16:27 True story when my son was like 3, we noticed he was being really quiet.  We went looking for him, found him in bathroom.

He had found the bottle of fish oil gummies and ran off with them. Ate the whole bottle.  In hindsight, probably should have taken him to the hospital.
4918 2018-05-20 20:16:26 The subject was coal. Coal miners. You can move the goal posts it you want, but...   Besides, oil will soon be losing in the automotive industry as we're moving to electric. The world is moving on.
4919 2018-05-20 20:16:26 please stop buying Venezuelan oil and then send a few marines to get rid of the colectivos
4920 2018-05-20 20:16:23 this looks fab - my mum has had skin cancer 3 times (due im sure  to the lax views on skin care and being safe in the sun they had in the 60s - they used to pour oil on themselves!) #SunAwarenessWeek2018
4921 2018-05-20 20:16:09 Idk. But vegetable oil (the one you call groundnut oil) is definitely not groundnut oil.
4922 2018-05-20 20:16:06 Do u have crude oil in your village if u call 198 naira to the dollar destruction and 360 to a dollar repair u must be a devilishly primitive scoundrel
4923 2018-05-20 20:16:02 I feel like are missing the opportunity for an important exposé: how did vegetable oil come to be referred to as groundout oil? Someone please take the floor.
4924 2018-05-20 20:16:00 #TRUDEAU policies have the depth of a 'fingerbowl'.  On one hand he promotes Canada as a can do place of technology, character and #resourcefulness.  Then demands  we make #restitution for using #clean coal, & #producing oil.  Should we be proud or ashamed, pick one.
4925 2018-05-20 20:15:56 I will have what he is having :) I'm so tired of giving money to the BIG OIL, would love this type of car for sure, keep up the great work @elonmusk and the whole @Tesla  team
4926 2018-05-20 20:15:32 Man, Oil and Water don't mix.
4927 2018-05-20 20:15:20 If you feel like that is the larger source of hatred and malice, you’re either a liar, or you aren’t paying attention.
4928 2018-05-20 20:15:13 Which should make it a type of vegetable oil, no?

4932 2018-05-20 20:14:59 First time I tasted groundnut oil I was angry with myself.
4933 2018-05-20 20:14:55 I still use makeup wipes & micellar water to remove make up (my concealer tebal babi) n then I use oil cleanser and normal cleanser hahaha idk to rly get the dirt out
4934 2018-05-20 20:14:40 Whoever has seen many of social crisis, yet didn't dive in to help, are either mentally retards or mentally ill.  If they won't pour oil into all of the gulf, then quit letting the samething in an indirect form happen.
4935 2018-05-20 20:14:26 I never buy anything that contains #palmoil, or if the label says vegetable oil, as it often is palm. It's a pain checking every label, and it's in so many things edible and non-edible, but only until you know your products.
4936 2018-05-20 20:14:21 @jkenne
So pipelines are like "slavery" but you see that we "need" oil?So better to get oil from "oppressive"regimes,right?
4937 2018-05-20 20:14:12 Bio oil to reduce redness? Yes please.
4938 2018-05-20 20:14:11 Gab, do you really think doors should be included?  So we sedate all gun owners with *weed*  Hash oil?
4939 2018-05-20 20:14:11 Our oil companies act like they're part of the cartel now. We haven't seen that since January.
4940 2018-05-20 20:14:09 
4941 2018-05-20 20:14:01 Wanna acct
4942 2018-05-20 20:13:54 Lmao. Groundnut oil is literally oil made from groundnuts 
4943 2018-05-20 20:13:54 Sure.. oil sheiks are the hardest working men alive right ? 
Heritage is soo important. Rich ppl are often born into much better life conditions. If you are born into poverty you more likely to experience violence and depression. 
Also success is not defined by money.
4944 2018-05-20 20:13:44 YOU can since you just said you have 3B hair. people with coarser hair textures need more than just oil though. this is the problem with whites, we here trying to educate you and you won't listen!!
4945 2018-05-20 20:13:41 You sir are a snake oil salesman. Socialism has never and will never work. East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Russia and most recently Venezuela. You people never learn, do you?
4946 2018-05-20 20:13:40 I think Afro puffs are cute!
Castor oil, argan oil, Shea butter, no gel and a good hairdresser
Shomi is derived from Oluwashomi which means God watches over me
4947 2018-05-20 20:13:16 We were supposed to all get together for a game night. Still trying to find a day where everyone is free.
4948 2018-05-20 20:12:59 My face produces so much oil in the summer time.
4949 2018-05-20 20:12:42 Liscio come l'olio smooth like oil in Italian
4950 2018-05-20 20:12:40 Perhaps by allowing us to enjoy the vast resources this ENTIRE COUNTRY has to offer, and by allowing us to use these vast resources - all of them, from oil to electricity - with fewer restrictions, fewer taxes and the opening up of ALL OPPORTUNITIES to discover, refine and use (1
4951 2018-05-20 20:12:38 I'm convince green tea is just good for everything An Coconut oil .
4952 2018-05-20 20:12:37 Well, pawpaw oil/extract. Not unlike pritt-stick in consistency. Get it from family in Oz but I think I’ve seen it over here. Would think you could get it in that London. 
Smells nice and really takes the edge off.
4953 2018-05-20 20:12:31 All 3 investigations are justifiable, especially Benghazi,   since Americans died there, and Hillary Clinton's 'secret spy network' pushed her to help a Lybian official who would 'honor' their oil contract.
4954 2018-05-20 20:12:31 I was frying samosas and the oil started to pop and go mad and it went into my EYE 

And this is why fried foods are the devil
4955 2018-05-20 20:12:21 Congealed groundnut oil is bae
4956 2018-05-20 20:12:17 This bigoted thug racist's only talent is being a conman extraordinaire who actually loves selling his snake oil.
4957 2018-05-20 20:12:14 with muqtada sadr winning elections in iraq,iran would lose it's influence over there too,if sadr chooses to sides with Turkey, turks would help them if they ensure the safety of oil pipeline,so yes iran is finished but again i say, we should just oversee,our primary focus is afg
4958 2018-05-20 20:12:05 Lmao. Dodo is the only thing that should be fried with palm oil.
4959 2018-05-20 20:12:02 I found peppermint oil capsules helpful, as long as I took them with food. Without food and my colon was an icy fire pit.
4960 2018-05-20 20:12:01 His father nationalized oil companies, that didn’t work too well neither.
4961 2018-05-20 20:11:56 Apparently tea tree essential oil in hot water can clear your blocked nose. 

All it did was make me dizzy and puke up dinner. 

I'm obviously falling apart very slowly.
4962 2018-05-20 20:11:22 Thanks, Kaye. I hadn't heard of neem oil before, but it sounds like a good staple for the garden shed
4963 2018-05-20 20:11:16 I agree,  but manage fairly.  No running them off their ranges in favor of ranchers,  oil drilling,  fracking.  No inflating their numbers to justify removals.  Never slaughter
4964 2018-05-20 20:11:12 Sick. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a legend. I am so caned.
4965 2018-05-20 20:11:08 Haha! Trump just gave them the green light to resume building nuclear weapons. And we got higher oil prices.

4971 2018-05-20 20:10:08 A house guest left some supermarket hummus in the fridge. Initially I was sceptical, but by the time I’d added some microplaned garlic, paprika, cumin, salt, lemon juice, olive oil, tahini & about six times the original volume in puréed chickpeas it wasn’t bad at all.
4972 2018-05-20 20:10:06 EMU oil. Australian one. Toughens everything. It's like super glue 4 human body
4973 2018-05-20 20:10:05 He’s made them chase their own tails ever since the election! It’s brilliant.

4976 2018-05-20 20:09:32 He stated the keystone pipeline was for non US use of oil. Said they fired whole bunch of people that worked at the Veterans affair. It was only one person they fired. How that for just off the top of my head
4977 2018-05-20 20:09:02 I've only had groundnut oil once or twice in my life. Do not recommend.
4978 2018-05-20 20:09:00 They'll try to hold on to us only until the oil runs out

Then will tell us to fuck off as they will have milked the cow dry 
4979 2018-05-20 20:09:00 Oil is not coal
4980 2018-05-20 20:08:58 Why's palm oil in the options ?
4981 2018-05-20 20:08:42 What is rosemary essential oil good for?
4982 2018-05-20 20:08:30 Russians sanctioned is holding up the development artic mega oil fields. US rigs and technology is needed to move forward $100 of trillions waiting on Trump to drop sanctions.
4983 2018-05-20 20:08:17 @HotelChocolat it with regret that I have today cancelled my very long running subscription of 20yrs. You state that you're ethical but use palm oil.  Chocolate should never be enjoyed at the detriment to other animals .. in this case the ornangutans and eco system in Borneo. 
4984 2018-05-20 20:08:04 not sure i follow.  doesn't the absolute price matter for consumers (at least those that don't work in the oil sector) rather than the net oil import number?
4985 2018-05-20 20:07:57 You'd think you've found the LOYL only to find out they fry plantain with   palm oil.

4990 2018-05-20 20:07:07 Oh enlightened one, the point is
the plastic is made from oil, as are countless things the tree-huggers count on.
4991 2018-05-20 20:07:00 :::whispers::: Idk what that mess was about but LOC/LCO method *I’m* familiar with stands for Liquid, Oil, and Cream. Referring to the order you should layer your products to seal in moisture.

4993 2018-05-20 20:06:56 Someone wise should do an analysis of where the income went from Fort Mac and Bakken oil jobs. Start with Sask - high debt from unrealistic borrowing and now broke broke broke to Alberta, once owner of the Heritage Fund before Jim Prentice. Not long term but rather  the opposite.
4994 2018-05-20 20:06:56 Russia’s main source of money is oil. Do you think the jump in oil prices to $70 a barrel is an accident? Saudi’s etc are helped also.Donald will use the high prices 2 continue pushing 4 oil drilling off the Atlantic coast & Nat’l parks &  for more pipelines. He will get a cut.
4995 2018-05-20 20:06:56 I wouldn't doubt it. I wonder if Hemp oil is legal in PA? I've used a trial bottle in Oklahoma and it worked for my migraines as well as other joint pains and the only side effect is it tasting like raw unsalted peanuts.
4996 2018-05-20 20:06:55 Lmaoooooo I swear, but groundnut oil is lit though. Less cholesterol I hear.
4997 2018-05-20 20:06:53 How do people live with taking Fish Oil! I’m not about this fishy burp life. #askingforafriend
4998 2018-05-20 20:06:50 Is it by population? What are we exporting aparts from oil that we need 55 ports. One more functional commercial port in the East and we are good to go.
4999 2018-05-20 20:06:44 And that's about the only argument you have.
5000 2018-05-20 20:06:22 Oil wise...I think a lot of the risk has been priced in; possible move up in knee jerk to ~73 before a decent pullback...also note MM's are starting to jump ship..albeit small...some profit taking at these levels for big funds is smart...futures have gotten ahead of real price
5001 2018-05-20 20:05:58 That's one essential oil I don't have.
5002 2018-05-20 20:05:58 Americans act like they give a fuk about the people in #Venezuela . The only thing our government cares about is the fact that they dont have a hand in Venezuelan OIL! Dont be gullible. Trump doesnt care about hungry Latinos
5003 2018-05-20 20:05:24 Agree with @TariqSDesai .. I don't know much about pricing policy of fuel..but I think govt should check how this fuel price being fixed by this oil company.. there must be profit components in the fuel price. That can be checked... #FuelPriceHike

5014 2018-05-20 20:04:53 Thank you!! Some people don’t realize that we are talking about diluted bitumen - even worse for the ocean than conventional oil. The KinderMorgan/ Transmountain pipeline will mean a 7 fold increase in tanker traffic. @JustinTrudeau needs to rethink this.
5015 2018-05-20 20:04:46 I answer all phones. Still waiting.
5016 2018-05-20 20:04:43 Obaseki said that the state was developing robust forestry management structures to ensure that the state’s biodiversity is conserved even as oil palm plantations expand their operations.
5017 2018-05-20 20:04:33 I spread the miles over a number of cars, currently 3. The highest has 110,000 including over 25,000 miles towing a trailer. Maintenance included oil changes ($20 every 12,000 miles), other repairs - $20 for bushings but that wasn't in the CEL discussion.
5018 2018-05-20 20:04:26 Funny thing is, for at least three minutes I've been wondering why you'd fry plantain in groundnut oil, then it hit me that you're probably referring to vegetable oil.
5019 2018-05-20 20:04:24 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

5021 2018-05-20 20:04:17 Iranian sanctions and the fact that Saudi Arabia wants to hold onto it's market share of the oil industry. That's what's driving process so high.
5022 2018-05-20 20:04:16 At the second day of the retrogaming event at Bescot Stadium.

5035 2018-05-20 20:02:21 @theresa_may @DefraGovUK Fracking is wrong & must be banned you the government should represent the population of this country NOT cosy up with big business, we don’t need new oil we need more renewable energy less plastic not more oil more saving the environment not killing it
5036 2018-05-20 20:02:19 We should start rationing petrol, nice joke but how about rationing petrol 

If everybody across the world does it OPEC cartel will have to get their oil prices down 

Iran is retaliating because USA had imposed sanctions, sweet revenge

5038 2018-05-20 20:01:47 No it's not.
5039 2018-05-20 20:01:41 If China does agree to bring $200 billion in our goods in it helps strengthen Trump's hand against the EU in regards to Iran. Just need some of those energy purchases in  oil.
5040 2018-05-20 20:01:34 Or was your seriously comment about the oil part in which case I have no clue..lol
5041 2018-05-20 20:01:16 I'm sure any explanation will be snake oil.

Hockey really needs to make the nets wider. The sport is at it's best when it's a rush game but the only time you get goals off shots on the rush are screwups.

So instead we get endless cycling along the boards at 5on5.

5056 2018-05-20 19:59:14 I knew a girl who had an issue with her engine, so her brother checked the oil, put the dipstick in, and nothing came out. Car was literally out of oil. It only takes like an hour to get oil changed, but I’m amazed at how many people ignore simple maintenance.

5059 2018-05-20 19:59:04 I believe that BC has every right and all people involved in this pipeline corruption  is correct in doing what they are doing but you have no right to turn off anything to make people suffer just because you have been bought and paid for and brainwashed by the oil cartels
5060 2018-05-20 19:59:02 You ain’t do no work you just put some baby oil on  keep grinding
5061 2018-05-20 19:59:00 Getting screwed over again ! Bring on the chip oil !
5062 2018-05-20 19:58:56 I use frankincense oil on my hands for arthritis and it does work! That’s when I got into Living Young Essential oils they are 100% oils! Got Headaches? Use stress away & lavender! Gone!!
5063 2018-05-20 19:58:50 Always start with anchovies, sauté in their own oil until they dissolve. That lends an exquisite umami base to everything that comes after. You might think they’d make your sauce fishy, but they don’t.
5064 2018-05-20 19:58:45 Ndugu @mkainerugaba I highly doubt if your projection can really work in a country where corruption is an order of the day! Certainly we r on course of destiny however we seriously need to fight corruption if we to gain from oil money
5065 2018-05-20 19:58:38 Morgan Stanley: "our economics team estimates that close to one-third of the tax cut benefit to the US consumer may have already been removed by the rise in oil and gasoline prices."
5066 2018-05-20 19:58:28 What abt the 2 lakh crore subsidy which Manmohan singh gave to oil cos.. why did my tax money go to Audi owners? Modi shud in fact increase more oil price so that ppl understand the value of public transport.. and make world less polluted...
5067 2018-05-20 19:58:27 Just seeing this, 
Fear catch me when i saw it o, i read up on it and i know where i stand.  I go start to dey drink Anointing oil.
5068 2018-05-20 19:58:03 Your understanding of hypocrisy is critically flawed.All those trail-mix crunching fresh-air enthusiasts depend on oil & so do you
5069 2018-05-20 19:57:53 It's a small reflection of the changes in our society. For a long time the oil cos. had "oil privilege" but now that other kinds of energy are growing and getting attention, oil gets outraged and says dumb things, trying to protect the status quo.
5070 2018-05-20 19:57:47 Oil backwardation has ended though so could mean a fall in price too
5071 2018-05-20 19:57:44 Oh, the goalposts moved.  The subject: "hurting Russia,"  The reply:  "Russia expects oil revenue to jump five-fold," which is not very painful.  

The US couldn't frack enough to quintuple revenue even by turning the whole country into earthquake-prone Oklahoma.  Good day, folks

5080 2018-05-20 19:56:20 That could work a lot better, lol. Def be careful. Use powder. Ya know. Have some warm cloths on standby some oil
5081 2018-05-20 19:56:14 That is quite literally the definition of being a leader. You know...representing the United States.
5082 2018-05-20 19:55:55 Seriously, the vague generalized statements or marketing tag lines used to try and sell open borders and ignoring sound immigration policy efforts runs rampant.  This usually means these same people find it necessary to suggest others are anti-immigration if they don’t agree.
5083 2018-05-20 19:55:23 Every $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil knocks 0.2% to 0.3% off India's growth rate - $PIN $INDA $INRUSD $INR

5093 2018-05-20 19:53:33 I started a bin twitter account for a laugh. A mad woman has latched on to me like a parasite. She's made a film about bins for me. She has my name on her bin. She puts baby oil on her bin to make it shiny

5095 2018-05-20 19:53:24 And the 1% stole their oil fields. I remember.
5096 2018-05-20 19:53:16 India has a huge foreign reserve, we need not pledge gold 

Plus we also have huge oil reserves in the reservoirs of Madurai and other locations

5097 2018-05-20 19:53:01 Says Downer who was behind the East Timor Sea spying case to steal a poor countries rightful oil and gas. Who then ended up employed by Woodside , the very company extracting the oil and gas. Your a real piece or work Downer, who should be in jail.
5098 2018-05-20 19:52:41 That's not how you lead.
5099 2018-05-20 19:52:34 If Maduro wins the squeeze on Venezuela oil production continues as sanctions will mount 

Which also means oil has more upside potential. Refineries maintenance and supply build up is a story for later
5100 2018-05-20 19:52:31 When there is no argument, there are always invectives.
5101 2018-05-20 19:52:30 Mad I'm out of oil but thankful for this fresh can of Crisco
5102 2018-05-20 19:52:28 I got an oil change and it was a stay in car service it was pretty awkward but my car is better now
5103 2018-05-20 19:52:25 Oh just saw the good bye. Too bad was wanting to explore the oil powered solar concept.
5104 2018-05-20 19:52:19 Wow. If only you were this sensible in 2012 when price of crude oil was "above $100/bbl"

Abeg go and sit down, chairman

5106 2018-05-20 19:52:13 Banks, NRA, health insurance co, Telecommunication, energy & Oil, Internet Co, pharma,  They can buy your government buy funding campaigns to influence your vote.  Then they pass legislation and laws under a false pretense to support their contributors agenda and interest.
5107 2018-05-20 19:52:06 I have to agree. I am waiting for someone like @kasie to get up enough nerve to ask @pryan if Republicans received in campaign funds directly or indirectly from Saudi Arabia or the UAE. I have to wonder if they were also on the Trump oil $ grave train.
5108 2018-05-20 19:52:04 Oil King is pretty wild

Maximum Rashid indeed
5109 2018-05-20 19:52:01 Why don't they use that money to develop Turkana & other marginalized areas! After all, Kenya has been managing without the oil revenue. Hizi wataiba tu
5110 2018-05-20 19:51:53 Great! Then Phase 7 of the #TMX , the extension to Westridge for the purpose of exporting oil to Asia can be unhitched from rest of the proposal!

5112 2018-05-20 19:51:39 My aesthetic is....sitting in the sun..ocean breezes...and olive oil
5113 2018-05-20 19:51:37 Stupidity reigns instead of Facts~
World almost out of Oil, should cost $10 a gallon!
US pays less for oil than rest of world yet you TALK BS!
Oil will run out soon so leaders you mention can't depend on oil!
Too bad you don't really know the facts!
FACTS DO MATTER BUT NOT YOURS!
5114 2018-05-20 19:51:34 fish fish fish, fish, and a bit more fish oil, plus some more fish.  

And sugar.

Also, I hope you like Tirimisu with fish.

5116 2018-05-20 19:51:22 yo Oil King @LeevyLin is fucking good! Great performance at #Stunfest2018
5117 2018-05-20 19:51:20 I love watching Oil King play Rashid
5118 2018-05-20 19:51:16 So solar energy is powered by gas, oil or maybe coal?  Wind energy too?  Geothermal? And tidal too I imagine?  Exactly how does that all work? Diagrams would probably help.
5119 2018-05-20 19:51:15 el oil pulling será buenísimo pero una guarrada también es
5120 2018-05-20 19:51:05 Oil King is MVP. That was some entertaining Rashid. I haven't said that in a long time. #SFV #Stunfest2018
5121 2018-05-20 19:51:04 Gas or oil?
5122 2018-05-20 19:50:47 The idea that frying something adds to its calories is so weird. They coat everything in olive oil, but if anything I'd say that makes it more likely to make it through without being digested.
5123 2018-05-20 19:50:45 Let's gooooo fujimura!!!!

Good games oil king. That set was amazing!
5124 2018-05-20 19:50:41 These sorts of comments usually come from people who don't know how to change their oil or start a lawnmower. #2ADefenders
5125 2018-05-20 19:50:39 Sir, what are ur views on destruction of konkan region for setting up Saudi oil refinery?. Wouldn't it hurt the sensitive ecodiversity? and traditional occupations of people as fishing and mango, jackfruit cultivations, which is multi crore business?
5126 2018-05-20 19:50:14 Globalists want foreigners telling us what to do.
5127 2018-05-20 19:49:56 Perfect day to drive around and listen to Black Hell Oil! Oh yeah!
5128 2018-05-20 19:49:51 Good point.
I remember during the oil crisis when vinyl got thinner I went to Chalmers and Joy for Argents In Deep, it was £2.49 about 30p increase from what I was expecting. It was a big hit on my pocket money I tell thee
5129 2018-05-20 19:49:50 Pesto should be : basil, garlic, pine nuts & olive oil . The cheese is optional.  But vegan pecorino must be available by now?
5130 2018-05-20 19:49:45 A Boss buttjob. Or more shenanigans with cooking oil.
5131 2018-05-20 19:49:45 Next time I'm using cooking oil.

5136 2018-05-20 19:49:25 Ain't nothing wrong with melamine bowls and plates unless you microwave them or pour hot oil on them.
5137 2018-05-20 19:49:17 Worshippers kwa?  You people tell lies for retweets... Of a truth subsidy was removed when the price of crude oil was low. Now that is has almost doubled, you think the price of imported petrol will remain the same? If he increased it as piece of crude increased, imagine d outcry
5138 2018-05-20 19:49:14 Thinking I’m funna fry some chicken to keep me from having to go out just to realize iaint got no oil 
5139 2018-05-20 19:49:12 Point being, the family SUV is a popular target. But even a complete outright ban of them might reduce our oil usage by maybe 5%, tops.
5140 2018-05-20 19:49:05 There were mixed performances among asset classes, with US bond yields falling but the US dollar rising, although AUD and NZD were resilient. Equities and oil are slightly lower.
5141 2018-05-20 19:48:57 #OOTT
There are too many variables on the #sanctions of #Iran #oil exports. They have not been taken into consideration by those $100 oil pundits and #Reuters when they hyped Iran fears. The former have their untold agenda and the latter lacks the fair and balanced #journalism.
5142 2018-05-20 19:48:57 Perhaps the thousands laid off when oil price sunk will have a chance to find employment now. #Aberdeen
5143 2018-05-20 19:48:53 Is it a carrier oil or essential oil?
5144 2018-05-20 19:48:51 It's literally the only way to do it. Can't believe people use groundnut oil.
5145 2018-05-20 19:48:46 US arms deals to Saudi and Israeli interests leads to 80$ pb oil spike, making fracking and coal competitive.  nice...mission accomplished.
5146 2018-05-20 19:48:46 I like it, don’t know much about Morand or Wallmark tho. Shaw is a hard sell to the oil who would have 10 mil invested in the same player lmao.

5152 2018-05-20 19:48:19 So forget dollar we do business on bitcoin.. new crypto currency...I think Venezuela is planing sell crude oil in crypto currency with 30% leaser than market rate..

5155 2018-05-20 19:48:08 I hate when Jake leaves because then I have no one to spray coconut oil in the back parts of my hair where I can’t reach :-(

5158 2018-05-20 19:47:59 If previous governments has done well to put Nigeria in a good part with patriotics which are not there, we can't say oil discovery is a course. The founding fathers in the SW developed the region thru agriculture and the projects are still visible till date

Let's gooooo
5161 2018-05-20 19:47:52 Tsk, tsk you hurt the snake oil doctors feelings. Shame on you.
5162 2018-05-20 19:47:49 There likely isn’t one of you that has any technical knowledge whatsoever regarding the oil industry. Which btw Canada absolutely leads the way in... and the hypocrisy of your petroleum product usage doesn’t go unnoticed
5163 2018-05-20 19:47:48 Look. Alaskan oil supplies are dwindling. WA State refineries & coastal California refineries require input replacement. That's where likely majority of increased KM throughput will eventually land.
5164 2018-05-20 19:47:33 What is your solution for Oil dilution?  Oil is totally smell like gas! Will it still protect the engine?
5165 2018-05-20 19:47:29 Or maybe because the price of crude oil...

5170 2018-05-20 19:46:49 Time for an oil change
5171 2018-05-20 19:46:47 I agree the debased dollar is a bad thing. What I hear from people in oil, which I hope is true, is that fracking & drilling technology improvements have accelerated, making many fields profitable at $40/barrel. Lack of pipelines is now the bottleneck.
5172 2018-05-20 19:46:40 @dpradhanbjp Kindly give us SOLUTIONS which we can put in our vehicles instead of PETROL. We know how much India is affected with International Crude Oil prices as we have seen it all in last 4 years, no explanation required please. #ParallelPricing #RelianceOil #EssarOil

5175 2018-05-20 19:46:26 CET and VAT is not applied in current years. It is part of Cruide oil price. Central govt is pushing GST council to include Petrol and odr
5176 2018-05-20 19:46:25 They should drag him from the Presidential palace to a jail cell.  The number of starving people in an oil rich nation is a disgrace beyond measure.

5178 2018-05-20 19:46:08 Tonight’s trick was to replace a sump plug washer without losing too much oil. Managed it and only sacrificed about 100ml. Hopefully there’ll be no more weeping from the bottom now.

How does and engine light going to fix my car oil change? Wait you didn't answer my question. Again guns are not the problem. Did I mention guns are not the p
5180 2018-05-20 19:46:01 Changing the oil on my father's truck today. This is gonna be fun...
5181 2018-05-20 19:45:53 It’s the worst!!! I put peppermint oil in a spray bottle with some water and sprayed it on the walls and carpet and ceiling and it keeps them all out!!
5182 2018-05-20 19:45:49 if you have lavender and frankencense oil mix 5 drops of each of those together with around a teaspoon of castor oil and apply to the scars twice a day, also after you add the oil, gently massage them for a few minutes

5189 2018-05-20 19:45:23 @amritabhinder @IndiaToday RG can't even understand d complexities in crude oil price hike..he may ask PC or Sam or Sashi..
5190 2018-05-20 19:45:13 Sure. But remember that only about 40% of that oil is refined into gasoline, and less than 50% of that is used for non-commercial vehicles. If you reduced personal vehicle consumption by half, that’s only about 350k barrels, less than 10% of total usage.
5191 2018-05-20 19:45:11 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
5192 2018-05-20 19:44:50 I've lived on the shore of Clayoquot Sound for 34 years. Still waiting here for the FIRST oil spill.

5194 2018-05-20 19:44:20 That's a really dangerous way to think about world affairs
5195 2018-05-20 19:44:16 lmao. Seun just went to expose himself with that dodo and palm oil something. huhuhu
5196 2018-05-20 19:44:12 Fair enough. Nobody that isn’t supported by oil money.

5203 2018-05-20 19:43:21 Of course no good came out of it - there wsa no sound rationale behind the move. Even Raghuram Rajan had recommended against it. It disrupted the economy which was poised to take advantage of the fall in the international oil prices, and caused great hardship to poor people!

5206 2018-05-20 19:42:53 Other than Russia being willing to sell oil and Trump's puppet master, this is just nonsense.
Please keep with facts and not undermine any efforts with adding to the conspiracy theories.

5213 2018-05-20 19:42:26 You are an educated person so don't be blind and negative!!
See the international oil prices and don't compare 2013 with 2018!
That time situation was different and today is different!
So it's a matter of time!
Central govt. Can't put patrol in GST without states agreement!!
5214 2018-05-20 19:42:17 @UCSUSA I work in marine transportation. There's been pushback against investments in oil based energy, most of which I wholeheartedly agree with. Our economy is oil based and won't change overnight. How about an article about what that transition might look like? Thanks!
5215 2018-05-20 19:42:09 Oil prices help propel FTSE to record high. Oh wonderful news. But what about the poor motorists?  I had to pay almost £100 to fill my diesel car tank today!
5216 2018-05-20 19:41:58 My dad’s a blessing. He went with me to get my oil changed, new windshield wipers, new tires, and a full front end alignment and insisted on going to make sure I got the best deal and then insisted on paying for it all. ALL OF IT. Anime isn’t the only thing that makes me cry.
5217 2018-05-20 19:41:58 I’ve never been big on any such drugs but now wanting weed or CBD oil or anything to deal with these busted joints and burning brain. But live in a state with strict liquor laws so it’s all deep underground and I definitely don’t have connections. But first time interested.

5220 2018-05-20 19:41:44 Um, they ARE protesting tankers. The #KinderMorgan pipeline means a seven fold increase in tankers. Their cargo - not conventional oil. It’s diluted bitumen from the Alberta #tarsands. Toxic dilbit sinks when it hits water. It cannot be cleaned up. #Oceans

5223 2018-05-20 19:41:00 Craig Oliver likes to put a price on the losses Canada will have without the Kinder Morgan pipeline. Never seems to mention the cost of a potential BC oil spill, or more severe weather caused by climate change. @ctvqp

5225 2018-05-20 19:40:30 ... she is obviously someone who has never actually been in danger and was sweat-inducing glad she had something to give her a chance while waiting for the 911 operator to answer.  Bully for her, but I'll never give up mine.
5226 2018-05-20 19:40:28 With a little olive oil, 250 million year old sea salt (before it expires), and maybe a touch of garlic powder

5230 2018-05-20 19:40:11 80+ years labour were in power and it lead to the highest mortality rate among men in Europe, the highest child poverty in Europe, the rise of foodbanks, the squandering of over tri££ions in oil wealth, 9.4% of £2t debt and depopulation of our biggest city. Labour care not at all
5231 2018-05-20 19:40:08 Paper wasps often build nests in residential yards. Before trimming shrubs or hedges, or picking fruit, check the plant for paper wasp nests. Treat wood fences and deck railings with a repellent oil to deter paper wasps from gathering cellulose from the wood. #pests

5234 2018-05-20 19:40:01 I think Stewart, Taft & Greenpeace would be very happy with a Deep State. Only that their Deep State would have a different agenda. This Tyee article describes what they say is the Deep State of oil & govt but pretty obvious they want their own Deep State. 
Flip the argument.
5235 2018-05-20 19:40:00 How about we get rid of both DOEs? Education has failed: unless they were working to dumb down the population. Energy was to lessen our dependence on foreign oil which at the time, in 1978, was 30%. 5 years ago it was 70%. I'll wager it's still high because cost keeps going up.
5236 2018-05-20 19:39:33 The Shepherds would pour oil on the sheeps head so that anything that tried to get to them would slip off and to guard their ears.

5237 2018-05-20 19:39:23 Do you believe everything you are told? What was the narrative when oil was at 26?
5238 2018-05-20 19:39:17 Unfortunately for The Sun, Express etc that sensible, truth doesn’t sell newspapers. It’s a disgrace how those kind of outlets, and many snake oil selling MPs, are misleading swathes of the public by telling them the exact opposite.

5241 2018-05-20 19:38:52 Is that polish on your bin or baby oil!?
5242 2018-05-20 19:38:40 I think Infil wins against Oil King in GF, I dunno if Infil beats Fujimura.
5243 2018-05-20 19:38:38 Even (or especially) Midnight Oil?

 How can we sleep. 
When our eardrum's burning? 
5244 2018-05-20 19:38:37 I saw Hellen Keller at McDonald's and I told her I was a big fan and she said gays can burn in hell then pushed my grandma into hot oil then asked the employees if they had Braille menus so she could order a big mac and shove it down my throat I'm so ashamed
5245 2018-05-20 19:38:35 Mustard oil dumbass lol. Smh
5246 2018-05-20 19:38:30 I thought fujimura has to play oil king first
5247 2018-05-20 19:38:25 We are as guilty as hell my friend. We have raped and pillaged our way around the earth for centuries. Nothing was ever done for god and glory. It was done for OIL, DIAMONDS, RUBBER, SLAVERY etc etc. Shameful. Don’t get caught up in the flag waving jingoism. Step back and look..
5248 2018-05-20 19:38:24 Hey, have you been watching 'Trust' on FX?  The story of JP Getty 3's kidnapping in Italy. Dir. by Danny Boyle, w/ Hilary Swank, Brendan Fraser and Donald Sutherland playing Getty 1. 1 episode in particular is very oil biz heavy
5249 2018-05-20 19:38:22 Ha ha! Mayank ji forgets that the Excise duty charged on oil is the Central Govt's domain. When the international prices plummeted from end of 2014, rather than decrease prices, they kept on increasing the excise. And, as you pointed out - having Sambit Patra as ONGC director!!

5253 2018-05-20 19:38:03 It is inspiring to see an orphan find his roots, become emotionally healthy after being bullied, saving a bus full of children, saving men left for dead on an oil rig, humbly saving a woman from being harassed, saving his town & the world from genocide & tyranny. MoS is inspiring
5254 2018-05-20 19:37:57 Do I stain/oil now or wait a wee bit? Now as in not tonight as I am fucked and achey 
5255 2018-05-20 19:37:55 we need balance, we are neither responsible for the miseries of iran nor are puppets of saudi Arabia, as far as oil is concerned, we can purchase from nigeria, to hell with these two evils

5264 2018-05-20 19:36:26 Oil should not be a commodity or be on any trading list.
5265 2018-05-20 19:36:10 my grandma was a painter and my dad said that he didn’t wanna deal with taking care of all her oil paintings and i’m literally heartbroken they’re so beautiful i hate how weird and distant my dad is from his family

5274 2018-05-20 19:35:07 A significant blocker is undoing the misinformation from the anti-virus industry -- consumers now believe snake oil is real security when if anything, it puts them at risk.
5275 2018-05-20 19:34:56 Get some oregano oil pronto
5276 2018-05-20 19:34:39 It is expensive. Remember it is not just cost it is about also the prediction of EVs and peak oil demand, why will refiners really invest in their refineries on a crude oil that has no clear idea of its life span or how much it can produce
5277 2018-05-20 19:34:27 Yes, Oil from A, B or anyone else in the world is a perfect substitute (i.e. a single world price). 

Supply curves are upward sloping -- willing to sell more at a higher price, less at a lower price.
5278 2018-05-20 19:34:13 It’s both. We import. But if we didn’t produce as much as we do, we’d have to import more, and would cost more. Important note that we import crude oil. Not gas. I believe all gas/diesel is refined domestically.
5279 2018-05-20 19:34:02 I've stopped buying products that have palm oil in them.  That includes chocolate! We all need more education, starting with children, on the way our food is produced. And what is destroyed in it;s wake.

5281 2018-05-20 19:33:50 Vitamin E oil is wonderful for dry, chapped lips. Try using in place of a chap stick or lip balm.
5282 2018-05-20 19:33:50 I know that, but you don't have near as much oil as the US. The amount of oil you drill from AUS is no where near the amount needed to supply your entire country. Think a little.
5283 2018-05-20 19:33:45 If he can be persuaded to donate to MoveOn, yes. Bottom line, the issue is $. We are being outspent by a cabal of billionaires & corporations. Money buys visibility & drives messaging in this country, unfortunately. We are scrambling up a slick slope painted in oil...

5290 2018-05-20 19:32:34 One more reason he doesn't give a damn about rising oil prices.
5291 2018-05-20 19:31:52 Crude oil prices fell steadily in'15 & '16 but are up 33% since Jan. '17. Given the increasing instabilty in the middle east don't expect them to come down any time soon. We may look back on $3,69 as the good old days.
5292 2018-05-20 19:31:45 I tried making a bone broth like drink combining beef bouillon + collagen + MCT oil + creatine.

Awful.

Don't do it.
5293 2018-05-20 19:31:43 yeah. oil is actually from marine animals, and it's mainly microscopic ones like plankton. But it's a common mistake to refer to oil as being "dead dinosaurs" so I felt it was close enough to use.
5294 2018-05-20 19:31:21 That’s just you saying this and while you may know an incredible amount about the pipeline, shipping oil by oil tanker to Asia is not your specialty and is only your opinion in support of what I know you support already.

5296 2018-05-20 19:31:07 I would say drop in oil prices has hurt N. Dakota for sure. Also, massive growth when oil was over $100/barrell led to a correction.
5297 2018-05-20 19:31:04 do i drink a second can of monster now and burn the midnight oil or do i accept defeat in an hour or so?
5298 2018-05-20 19:30:58 Yay for oil showers, NOT 
5299 2018-05-20 19:30:52 need a reminder of the facts regarding oil extraction and its related economic and political crises? without forgetting the ecological consequences of its extraction, transport and refinement!  
5300 2018-05-20 19:30:44 Oh ok.  Well, there was one time when Infil forward jumped out, then Oil King canceled to v-skill > air spike and hit him.
5301 2018-05-20 19:30:40 The numbers just don’t add up. Most analysis is oil supply and product demand. It then treats refineries as magical black boxes that run whatever you send it and produce what you want.

Sure. Just wait for the next person to help you sir .

5321 2018-05-20 19:26:58 I have news for you. Gas prices have to do with the oil companies. It never has had anything to do with any President. We have plenty of oil in this country. We just need to access it and drill. Make sure you check facts. I’m not trying to be mean I’m just speaking truth.
5322 2018-05-20 19:26:58 That's the misery .. Central govt has no role or control in #FuelPriceHike . yet we have some independent director of oil company -i.e ONGC  constantly backing govt action with a lovey smile in his face in TV debate.. #FuelPriceHike they must have some excuse #FuelPriceHike
5323 2018-05-20 19:26:56 Comparing oil prices during Maunmohan is irrelevant duties were less but inflation was sky high that why economy was in doldrums high duties atleast being used in infrastructure development not like CONgress timed when it was going in few ppl's pockets, those can afford shld bear

5333 2018-05-20 19:25:43 Big facts! Especially fresh out the oil

5339 2018-05-20 19:25:28 Taste.... Simmer....perhaps add a little more salt...simmer. taste. It should have just a hit if the salt & it will. It's crazy but it works. Serve over spaghetti tossed with olive oil. Sprinkle w) shaved parmesan. I personally add pepper at the table. Perfect. Simple. No butter.
5340 2018-05-20 19:25:24 I actually have and its not all about that hype, there's barely water in Hargeisa and many other issues and as of rgiht now oil crisis.

5346 2018-05-20 19:24:50 to much oil, not enough air in the mix. Our (USS) boiler fed ships did the same. Now most are gas turbines. Same concept still applies.
5347 2018-05-20 19:24:46 My only wish is that oil king wouldve represented throw more on infil's wake up, what a mf set tho!!! Mf stunfest is stacked this year
5348 2018-05-20 19:24:41 So the ONE time Oil King tried to throw Infiltration

He teched

LOL!

5351 2018-05-20 19:24:32 that oil king v infiltration match was crazy

If they start sneezing at all, or they seem itchy, or are taking dust baths more often than normal switch the oil or stop using the diffuser
5368 2018-05-20 19:22:46 Simple tomato sauce that isn't a Bolognese. 1 large can good quality chopped tomatoes, 1 large onion, good quality sea salt, olive oil. Saute chopped onions in oil til soft, add tomatoes and at least a teaspoon of salt. Simmer for fifteen minutes, check and add more salt...
5369 2018-05-20 19:22:42 I was getting really tired of my ipad screen looking like an oil slick and a friend of mine recommended I get one of these little half gloves (I guess they’re actually for fine art, pencils, oils, etc?) and so far it’s really cut down on tablet screen wiping!
5370 2018-05-20 19:22:30 let's go oil king!
5371 2018-05-20 19:22:19 Its Diesel.  Fun fact - Churchill converted to Royal Navy to oil from coal and immediately made the Middle East strategic.
5372 2018-05-20 19:22:12 Potato spices, uses of mayo compared to oil, inclusion of hard boiled egg and of course the potatoes must be pure, and white. Always white potatos, never red or purple.
5373 2018-05-20 19:22:02 Please recheck ur facts. Use ur brains. Fuel prices are deregulated and Depends entirely on intl market prices for crude oil. The private operators are also bearing loss to certain extent. A small portion is passed on to consumers..
5374 2018-05-20 19:21:59 I tell you
5375 2018-05-20 19:21:56 Ya I’m not a fan of cuts to hc or education. But I believe small biz helps drive the ab economy and with oil projecting to go up there are other solutions. Can’t have it all maybe
5376 2018-05-20 19:21:48 Is like when people outside of Texas called me "cowboy" and asked if i rode a horse to school and owned an oil field. Except it's worse because its fellow Texans saying it.

5378 2018-05-20 19:21:29 How much more would you like me to understand? I am a gun owner. I do not use my weapon to intimidate others or get attention. I don’t unsafely shove it down my pants to “trigger the libs”. And I do not pervert a constitutional amendment to mean citizens can have any and all guns

5384 2018-05-20 19:20:38 Hope BJP look to solve this by either decreasing taxes which were increased while global oil price were low or put it under GST.
People have given BJP votes wholeheartedly from every place of india.Its time to payback people for the trust which they have shown to BJP.
5385 2018-05-20 19:20:35 Okay so I used Argan Oil for two days and I woke up with bright, clearer, more hydrated skin BLESS

5390 2018-05-20 19:19:48 About the $100million. Buhari was tryna say that: those oil prospecting and development companies who came to prospect for oil and invest in our economy were responsible for the corruption as it were. Pls I will inbox my alc details. Thanks

5397 2018-05-20 19:19:16 So our new gas stove is a fucking beast.
The old electric stove took 3-4 mins to get the cooking oil ready for the garlic for my chili.
THIS FUCKER?
*THIRTY SECONDS*.
I actually very slightly burned the garlic!

That is soooooo terrifying, geeZ X_X.
Gotta get used to new timings!

5402 2018-05-20 19:19:05 Yea I’ve been using that w no luck :( I use the witch hazel toner and tea trea oil but no luck it’s a lil better but keeps coming back 
5403 2018-05-20 19:18:59 This Oil King v Infiltration Winnter's Final Match is INSANE. Seeing things I've never seen before and godlike reactions :O Stunfest is crazy
5404 2018-05-20 19:18:51 Swear Oil King cheated there. Absolutely scandalous use of invincibility frames.
5405 2018-05-20 19:18:40 That was the most godlike thing I've ever seen from oil king
5406 2018-05-20 19:18:35 Bot go for an oil change or something. We already know how you play both sides against each other. That fearmongering shit only works on low IQ people.We know almost all your tactics now. You people are powerless to decieve us now. Revelation is light. And light dispels darkness.

5411 2018-05-20 19:18:07 Parachute oil 
5412 2018-05-20 19:17:56 No Gary, these all are your false assumptions. If we were talking about modular housing for the poor you could use NIMBY, but we’re talking about selling oil to Asia for a quick buck, for AB Oil tax revenues and that’s hardly a noble cause for NIMBYism!
5413 2018-05-20 19:17:50 Being owner of oil wells it duty of modi to supply diesel petrol on cheap rates 
5414 2018-05-20 19:17:40 Whoops! Ha ha ! Browned in SAME.. ie the olive oil

5418 2018-05-20 19:17:19 Go to grocery store, purchase jar of Bertolli - olive oil, basil & garlic.
5419 2018-05-20 19:17:17 I just want to eat arugula salad with lemon and olive oil for the rest of my entire life holy god in heaven.

5423 2018-05-20 19:17:01 Grate some tomatoes. Saute in pan with olive oil and garlic Bit of butter and fresh basil at the end. Toss with some cooked pasta. Fast easy and delicious.
5424 2018-05-20 19:16:42 Quem foi que obrigou o Oil King participar do #Stunfest como se fosse distribuir currículo no shopping? 
5425 2018-05-20 19:16:40 Ya Italy and penalties are oil and water
5426 2018-05-20 19:16:33 Saute diced onions & garlic in olive oil with a piece of pork loin or chops, add good red wine and reduce, then add whole peeled plum tomatoes, cook and whisk until tomatoes break up. Finish by adding some basil but remove the basil when you are done so it doesn't get bitter
5427 2018-05-20 19:16:25 Olive oil, 2 cloves thin wide sliced garlic, half diced yellow onion sautéed til just clear, San marzano WHOLE peeled tomatoes, tomato paste, salt salt salt, rough torn basil, stir stir stir, boil, simmer, pepper, THAT’S MY SAUCE JOURNEY.

5429 2018-05-20 19:16:12 Good night @DistilleryB16 Friday, so much tasty lamb and tequila. Also sparked a @Pipshotsauce appreciation fest: La boca del diablo, chickpeas, olive oil, salt, blender, dippy things, happy face.
5430 2018-05-20 19:16:07 The entire world wins.  Everyone but greedy oil companies.
5431 2018-05-20 19:16:05 Well oil you have to now, I bet hardly any oil guys are measuring nox!!!
5432 2018-05-20 19:15:50 Tbf I’ve heard of several trainers who have complained about Oil Seed Rape in surrounding fields before, think Jeremy Glover was one badly affected by it years ago!
5433 2018-05-20 19:15:42 @PMOIndia  There must be proper reasoning given by govt for petrol and Diesel price calculations as per variations of global crude oil prices.
5434 2018-05-20 19:15:37 Did a nice we unexpected pasta dish last night. There was a chilli in the fridge, so I added a bit garlic, olive oil, tin of toms and some penne, few dried herbs. Chucked a wee bit of ale, soy sauce and Bisto into the mix...... feckin lush!
5435 2018-05-20 19:15:33 The agenda is real change. And I will stop calling them toys when people stop treating them that way. Case in point: as a prop for a photo shoot.
5436 2018-05-20 19:15:23 Fer chrise sakes man. Give it up. Alaskan oil tankers (VLCCs), since ~1977, roll past east coast of Van Isle, past Victoria, thru Haro Strait, past Gulf Islands into Straight of Georgia. Hell, I can see distillation towers of BP's Cherry Point refinery from my backyard!
5437 2018-05-20 19:15:14 try putting peppermint oil in your scalp
5438 2018-05-20 19:14:59 “Prince? What kind of name is that?”

He asks, placing the pan on the stove then adding a bit of olive oil, cracking all three eggs and tossing them in. Sunny side up meant they wouldn’t be moving anyway and with his flames they would be done in an instant to perfection.
5439 2018-05-20 19:14:56 How much is cooking oil Vusi?
5440 2018-05-20 19:14:31 @stephenfry I am watching the #munkdebate. I was going to tweet about the 'snake oil salesman' and then you actually use the phrase 
5441 2018-05-20 19:14:27 @BigGsaysYes if it hadn't been blown by WM, think what Scotland could be doing with its oil fund too
5442 2018-05-20 19:14:25 It’s the restart that has me miffed most. They could’ve easily declared force majeure after this oil gaff and cancelled. Now the championship results feel unfair.
5443 2018-05-20 19:14:24 Kinda like Obama ordering oil companies ( twice) to stop drilling after the Supreme Court said Obama had no authority or facebook (Obama supporters) blocking content.  Is that the king and book burners you were talking about?
5444 2018-05-20 19:14:24 Oil... But a smoker is a smoker...
5445 2018-05-20 19:14:16 I could’ve changed my oil on my own.
5446 2018-05-20 19:14:09 In your narrative did the price drop for oil have anything to do with the slowdown??
5447 2018-05-20 19:14:08 I hope you all aware dt Oil price is now run by open index nd no role of central Govt.

We have the oil crash and China/EM drama.

FX would have been better traded in daily chart without that kind of strong trend, otherwise humans will surely lose to HFTs.
5450 2018-05-20 19:13:35 Oh you're from Germany. The west, more specifically US with "israel" has funded those organisations. First it was Al qaida, then Taliban now Isis. It was a way of going into the middle east & steal their oil & resources
5451 2018-05-20 19:13:28 You must be certified. To be certified you must take 2 3-day Olive Oil Sommelier Certification Courses through Culinary School which costs $2,800. The 1st course introduces you to olive oil history and chemistry. The 2nd course teaches you how to evaluate and taste the olive oil.
5452 2018-05-20 19:13:25 The very simple one from the Frankie’s cookbook. It’s just like 1/2 cup olive oil, lots of whole peeled garlic cloves browned in sand and a few cans of whole tomatoes, crushed by hand simmered forever
5453 2018-05-20 19:13:22 I wonder about how the oil effects the surface too. But I thought it was a good idea!
5454 2018-05-20 19:13:15 Fry's closing comments are an even more epic put down of Dyson's "huckstering snake oil pulpit talk"...

5456 2018-05-20 19:12:47 Lolol I like my olive oil extra virgin 
5457 2018-05-20 19:12:46 That’s rubbish. Liberals more than acknowledge climate change, and know that oil will be phased out in its importance to the world. It has to. Plastic is going to have to be reduced for example.
5458 2018-05-20 19:12:42 Lead us to salvation, pour that oil please. That’s how we become Kings and Queens. #Frequency
5459 2018-05-20 19:12:41 Spending the afternoon slow living at the pool today with Rachel & Jared. Enjoying the sun, cool oil water, & heat while relaxing and talking about theory, politics, life, & much more!
5460 2018-05-20 19:12:38 Glo is mad anyhow
5461 2018-05-20 19:12:16 the other day someone tried to make a joke about oil spills and black people and i shut him down saying "yeah it wasn't really funny. it wasn't offensive, just not funny" and he learned his lesson i think
5462 2018-05-20 19:12:05 Trump is a Snake oil salesman.
5463 2018-05-20 19:11:54 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
5464 2018-05-20 19:11:46 oil king勝って欲しい
5465 2018-05-20 19:11:43 You're a moron. The Russia story was invented by neocons because Trump wants to end the Syrian conflict, which was started by Hillary and Obama to attack Russian/Iranian oil interests. You're the definition of a rube.
5466 2018-05-20 19:11:38 Ok, and what's the difference? Oil has skyrocketed.  Major fracking locales only make sense insofar as the dollar is so debased that oil is artificially high.  In short, Americans have to have their income eviscerated so that fracking can flower. I prefer when oil is cheap.
5467 2018-05-20 19:11:33 Да что ж такое. Вот заходишь на #ютуб посмотреть туторы по *вставьте любое хобби* и обнаруживаешь, что уже третий час смотришь видосы с милыми совушками. #челодлань
5468 2018-05-20 19:11:31 Quite true. Then again the Saudis have oil. It tends to moderate any condemnation
5469 2018-05-20 19:11:29 Swing oil
5470 2018-05-20 19:11:25 Getting in the shower after being covered in tanning oil >>>
5471 2018-05-20 19:11:24 What reference? For the 800th time, you said “Trump is throwing cash at KSA” while your “evidence” was an article about a trade deal with KSA buying weapons from us! That is oil and water, so again, are you adult enough to admit you were wrong or no? It’s really simple...
5472 2018-05-20 19:11:24 lacava cual maquinaria? salio a comprar esta descansando aunque algunos dice que al terminar de c..... iran a votar.

5475 2018-05-20 19:11:04 Not to be stupid, but how is that possible?
5476 2018-05-20 19:10:56 Lovely baptism today, baby #2 now a Christian. Now snuggling with him and smelling the Chrism oil on his head - my favourite thing :-)
5477 2018-05-20 19:10:30 Shit is so expensive in the oil fields man that's why I try not to break shit fuck around and end up broke 
5478 2018-05-20 19:10:29 Trying to get a head start on fixing all the things my family can fry me for e.g. Iv slathered my hands in vitamin e oil to avoid being called out for bloody cuticles by my grandpa
5479 2018-05-20 19:10:28 still importing 5-6m a day on net.  in the grand scheme of things the wide premium (permian discount) should lead to more investment in refining capacity for light.  

but take the point that with investment in pipelines to get tight oil to the coast, might raise overall output
5480 2018-05-20 19:10:21 It's going to be great if eventually the snake oil salesmen are the remainders.
5481 2018-05-20 19:10:19 I’m actually paying some one to change my oil..
5482 2018-05-20 19:10:19 Coconut Oil in your coffee is the best
5483 2018-05-20 19:10:18 Gave him a nearly full bottle of castor oil for hair growth,(I use it for my brows, hes "supposed" to use it for his beard) not a word from him since.
Heads up was given on thickness and smell. 
Asenglale..
5484 2018-05-20 19:10:16 Of course, he won’t bring a condom though

He wants to filled up and he’ll even bring baby oil too.. for fun
5485 2018-05-20 19:10:15 Demand is up. Every kind of oil has a market - just has to get there.
5486 2018-05-20 19:10:07 Food is natural, not fried and cooked in Olive Oil. There is no secret to health
5487 2018-05-20 19:09:57 Should have stopped your govts from bombing their countries for the Oil and Drug cartels that Fund their election campaigns.
5488 2018-05-20 19:09:54 I just spent 2hrs stripping silly putty out of Keiras hair. FYI coconut oil works and if you do it sitting in a bath you come out feeling like your feet got a pedicure 
5489 2018-05-20 19:09:46 Every time I wait for my oil change to get done my mind makes great plans for how I’ll get my shit on track again.  At least the oil change will get done 
5490 2018-05-20 19:09:44 This is simply idiotic. Revenue from coal and shale gas fracking will go direct to Westminster, just like offshore oil and gas, and renewable energy earnings. Are you on a windup to seek attention? Or is something wrong?
5491 2018-05-20 19:09:43 Incel Olive Oil

5494 2018-05-20 19:09:05 Lesson learned the hard way- don't put orange essential oil into your bath even if it says to dilute it with water before putting on your skin. Can't get any more diluted than a huge bathtub. It stung the back of my legs and gave me a rash. OW!!
5495 2018-05-20 19:09:02 @americanpickers 
Feeling good because I just did my first "pick", I bought an oil can for $1.10 instead of $4.
5496 2018-05-20 19:08:58 That's a pretty amateurish statement to make. Oil prices are market driven. You want the govt to keep protecting you and your car.
5497 2018-05-20 19:08:56 Lamb drizzled in Olive oil, Lemon juice and Oregano
5498 2018-05-20 19:08:46 This snake oil guy says some very non-snake oil kinds of things, this among them.
5499 2018-05-20 19:08:41 Oil sanctions against the DPRK were never enforced. The ability to analyze this was clouded by the fact that the US/Japan/SK all put out fake stories to secure political praise for pressure. I.e, Japan upped their coverage of "ghost ships" and blamed it on fuel shortages
5500 2018-05-20 19:08:35 Got dayum 

Infiltration and oil king are slugging it out
5501 2018-05-20 19:08:28 US estimates are that there’s very little oil and gas, barely commercially viable to extract it. Thank God. The Good Lord protects his Catholic people by giving ‘em nothing the Chinese will covet.

5505 2018-05-20 19:07:57 I was just in Indonesia for three weeks and I attempted to discuss palm oil industry related deforestation with numerous locals. Literally none of them even understood this was going on or that it was even an issue.

There needs to be targeted education in Indonesia on this.
5506 2018-05-20 19:07:49 True. Democrats have created more chaos post election than Russians could ever have done. 
True Putin Puppets are the Dems.

5514 2018-05-20 19:06:28 5 times more oil is exported than imported to Canada and the decision to buy Saudi oil comes from the morally bankrupt oil industry not politicians.
5515 2018-05-20 19:06:24 Abe ghochu, global crude oil prices went upto $120 per barrel in 2010s, that’s why you see a bump in retail prices. When the global oil prices came back down in 2014-15, Modi govt kept the profit for government rather than passing on the benefits to the public.
5516 2018-05-20 19:06:10 Rafa and our fan base is like water and oil. Won't work.
5517 2018-05-20 19:05:58 fish oil pills are a fantastic way to stay healthy and get your omega 3 if you do not plan on talking to anyone ever for any reason and also like to taste fish the in perpetuity
5518 2018-05-20 19:05:42 All of that & more could be achieved if Alberta didn't give their oil away. 1.9% royalty? Seriously?
5519 2018-05-20 19:05:34 do y’all think bald men put lotion or oil on their head so it won’t be ashy?
5520 2018-05-20 19:05:27 Everyone needs a nail oil pen. It brought my cuticles back from death within 24 hours.
5521 2018-05-20 19:05:10 You have to compare the cost of production vs the alternative which is purchasing oil on the open market at 50-70/barrel.
A barrel is 160litres
5522 2018-05-20 19:04:55 tea tree oil will help dries it out. but if it doesnt dries out in 2 days, you should find green concealers to cancel out the redness, put your skin color concealer on top of it and then powder it so that it’s matte and looks flat.
5523 2018-05-20 19:04:52 After 8 years of falling gas prices (you know cuz Obama had not ties to the oil and gas industry like Bush did). Now shit going back up. They should make Trump supporters pay $5 a gallon, and people with sense, $1.50
5524 2018-05-20 19:04:37 this coconut oil is working wonders for my hair
5525 2018-05-20 19:04:34 You never know what's fake and what isn't.  This is supposed to be a film showing the dead but what if this is a film set up by Israel to discredit Palestine?  Leave Israel & all ME countries to their own devices.  America just wants the oil & why do we give $BILLION$ to Israel?
5526 2018-05-20 19:04:33 Why you are always wrong? Improve your iq  if u can. Ask congress for oil for cash scam but this questions might stop your payments from Congress assholes. Try to generate other income sources as licking someone’s @&% is bad for health and wealth.
5527 2018-05-20 19:04:31 Nagka giyera ba noong pumalag ang mga Vietnamese sa paglagay ng China ng oil rig sa dagat ng Vietnam?

Nagka giyera noong nagpahayag ng statement ang Vietnam na nag oobligang tanggalin ng China ang misille sa Spratley?

Nagka giyera ba nang kumotra ang Pres ng Indonesia sa China
5528 2018-05-20 19:04:25 Trudeau putting so much political capital, and now taxpayer dollars into the Kinder Morgan pipeline sends a strong message .. a message the the Liberals want to pump more oil .. a message the climate change is no longer important @ctvqp
5529 2018-05-20 19:04:21 What I remember is that you had to chop every vegetable very finely, and then fry every vegetable separately, changing the oil... Them mix all together... And do some more... Very tasty yes!
5530 2018-05-20 19:04:13 Selling stuff we don't use. Fondue set that hasn't been used in 11yrs of marriage should go. (Tried to use, couldn't find oil for burner. Now we can't eat foods that go in it.) Silly, but it's something I always wanted. Best friend used to throw fondue parties, such fun memories.
5531 2018-05-20 19:04:06 Take #Ragnarok, #Infinity, greese it up with coconut oil, slap it, whip it out, than shoot it. Oh and paint black twice, you get #Deadpool2
5532 2018-05-20 19:03:53 Hello, Mr Corvo. May I interest you in my magical beard oil? I keep it in my vagina
5533 2018-05-20 19:03:50 Candles, warm room, hot oil... yup 
5534 2018-05-20 19:03:21 The Americans creating outsized fears about Canadian oil transport so they can acquire our crude cheaply are the real problem. If they win this one, our huggable welfare state is permanently hooped.
5535 2018-05-20 19:03:13 I'm perpetually anxious, but when I take CBD oil, it physically feels like my brain is untangling itself. It's not perfect, I'm still fairly anxious, but it's nice to get a break occasionally.
5536 2018-05-20 19:03:09 Halper planted info with minor players in Trump orbit, who then told an Australian, who then told FBI the same info they planted. Nutshell
5537 2018-05-20 19:02:54 @SaudiNT You will have oil but remain a people of beasts, of animals . You are almost worse than the Jews .
5538 2018-05-20 19:02:35 Sir, I am talking about internal crude oil price. This is at 80 doller because of our PM Narendra Modi. Other wise it would have been 100-110.
5539 2018-05-20 19:02:33 you WANT to do petro commerce w MORE state sponsors of terrorism? don't we want to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil?  the requirements are that iaea 'call ahead' n aren't allowed on military bases … is that thorough?
5540 2018-05-20 19:02:19 Wow another alt left goes for the throat and starts calling name. Their tolerant hypocrisy is outstandingly is their lack of knowledge when it comes to what oil provides them. How many smart phones have you had ungrateful Canadian? Petro based get a clue. 95% of ur home 2
5541 2018-05-20 19:02:18 Olive oil
5542 2018-05-20 19:01:56 If I already had my oil changed I would drive down to carowinds by myself.
5543 2018-05-20 19:01:50 Use the oil to fry me small egg and hotdog.
5544 2018-05-20 19:01:24 Minus coconut oil. High in saturated fats but there's a lot of conflicting information on saturated fats. In any case I'd still recommend more plant-based fats on this high fat low carb diet. In any case check it out if you want. I can help you with info if you want. 2/2

5550 2018-05-20 19:01:11 Do you need a pool boy for drinks and oil downs?
5551 2018-05-20 19:01:09 ah but when you split open that dull grey skin and this vibrant acid green delightful bean pops out you just know it's going to be good, crunchy sea salt crystals sticking to it, fruity spicy extra virgin olive oil, a tang of lemon juice...
5552 2018-05-20 19:01:06 Or maybe we can talk about being the leading country of export of oil. That's us

5562 2018-05-20 18:59:18 Look into CBD oil as a cure to lose no more children. Chemo, has a 50% success rate, which means it kills 1/2 of everyone treated. Also Baking Soda, vitamin B-17 work. I'm living proof, prostate cancer cured 17 yrs. ago, cancer free today at 72.
5563 2018-05-20 18:59:16 Rosehip oil. Organic
5564 2018-05-20 18:59:03 now im all for long haired tae but his ends are starting to look a lil dry they need to dip it in some macaron oil or give us a bun
5565 2018-05-20 18:58:58 Yeah, he was a pothead too, and thank God because Jimmy Carter cured his brain cancer with cannabis oil!
5566 2018-05-20 18:58:56 It *should* be what it's about.
I'm so tired of oil & gas folks telling us what we should be doing. 
I've been trying to figure out for decades why people think foreign investment is the key to Canadian Success when what it really is, is selling pieces of Canada

5572 2018-05-20 18:58:17 VP Pence is a sanctimonious hypocrite making a mockery of Christ. His meaningless pseudo-ideological platitudes barely conceal his slavish dedication to Republican donor class, the war/oil industry, anti-science religious zealots, and the Washington lobbyist swamp. Disgusting!
5573 2018-05-20 18:58:16 No Gary. These Alaskan oil tankers may pass through the Anacortes but they most certainly do not pass through the Burrard Inlet and Metro Vancouver. There’s a huge difference in the route and the risk from the Westridge Marine Terminal to the Anacortes shipping lanes.
5574 2018-05-20 18:58:12 Can't oil b extracted from it & the remains fed to livestock?

5581 2018-05-20 18:57:31 The reasons for the economic crisis are  manifold, but its heart can be found in the confluence of: a fixed  exchange rate, a concerted business sector effort to undermine the  economy, declining oil prices, and – beginning in 2017 – US financial  sanctions,

5583 2018-05-20 18:57:25 jfc, this is infuriating and not surprising and more infuriating BECAUSE it’s not surprising. 

Because we all know the answer is, truly, kids not having enough nutraceuticals. Cod liver oil, Magnesium, B12 megadoses, a sprinkle of essential oils would save everything. Folks,
5584 2018-05-20 18:57:22 la ultima vagabunderia del alto mando militar poner a inocentes soldados hambreados a votar por la narcocomunista dictadura cubana como buenos traidores de la memoria del libertador Simon Bolivar cagandose asi en el mas preciado legado de america. su libertad.

5586 2018-05-20 18:57:00 If even some of those “viewpoints” are snake oil salesmen like JRM, Boris etc promising a unicornian Brexit “cake and eat it” type deal that the EU would never agree to. That’s really helpful to the viewers, right Iain?
5587 2018-05-20 18:56:51 Sir only because of present govt, oil price is at 80 doller/barrel otherwise it would have reached more than 100 doller.

5602 2018-05-20 18:55:38 Westminster has stole all oor oil fur the last time, show us the oil receipts Theresa... where's the oil money gone Boris...

5605 2018-05-20 18:54:43 In addition to our poor economic policies, the lawsuits against Oil & Gas has killed a major part of our economy.  The effects are seen in so many areas. Governor shakedowns of oil & gas sectors also a detriment.  Many have moved their business to Texas.
5606 2018-05-20 18:54:35 That's cool, but he ain't no Oil Can Boyd.

5633 2018-05-20 18:50:23 Yes. Of course. Potatoism. Drives me to my knees all the time. Especially when turned into big wedges with olive oil and salt and a handful of fresh oregano leaves waved through right at the end
5634 2018-05-20 18:50:22 withdraw the beard oil, they are finished. (ps, my dad used to shoot nazis and put them on a pile then take photos- god bless ya dad- but was happier if they happened to kill a boar so people could eat )

5642 2018-05-20 18:49:55 So you pulled us out of the Iran agreement to increase oil prices for russia and OPEC. And thats where you got your campaign financing and personal loans from. It sounds pretty fishy to me.

5644 2018-05-20 18:49:39 It is ridiculous that 3 years after the Texas legislature legalized CBD oil, patients seeking proven medical treatment still face government barriers. Meanwhile, opioids from Big Pharma are given out like candy. Wonder if that has anything to with pharmaceutical lobbying efforts?
5645 2018-05-20 18:49:24 This woman sent me anointing oil 
5646 2018-05-20 18:49:20 The NDP has done a good job in a difficult situation. Despite inheriting the mess created by the PCs and a collapse in oil prices, Alberta has the strongest economy in Canada.
5647 2018-05-20 18:49:10 Oil billions. PSG and City could do the same and still collect domestic pots galore.
5648 2018-05-20 18:49:00 Then... if this is your belief, why not just come out and say that when you’re trying to justify #KM with #fakescience and #fakenews ? That you support #KM because youre a cheerleader for burning fossil fuels? Not that you have any actual science behind your Pro Oil beliefs!
5649 2018-05-20 18:48:57 Lies. You’re a crook, a liar, a cheat. You are disgusting and I pity those who can’t see through you. And why am I paying $3+ for a gallon of gas? Making your oil country friends happy??

5654 2018-05-20 18:48:36 Tbh, I think I was merely sleeping off all the carbs I’ve consumed with @cranberrylove this week, thanks to whom my blood now comprises 70% olive oil, 20% vinegar and 10% cheese.

5656 2018-05-20 18:48:24 Use pH balanced shampoo. Please go easy when rubbing your head after shower. Never use" Pantene" and head &shoulders. Mix some caster oil in coconut oil and massage gently before shower for hair loss.
5657 2018-05-20 18:48:21 ... The goal is to get off oil and onto other, more sustainable, cleaner, and cheaper energy sources. It has been getting cheaper and more available, that tech has been around for a fraction of the time petroleum has been being used...

5665 2018-05-20 18:47:42 This is straight up BS propaganda. I personally know people who have fled #Venezuela and the elections and starvation is NOT what the people WANT! US sanctions would have no effect on a Country with the worlds largest oil reserves = wealth. #FakeNews @NovusVero
5666 2018-05-20 18:47:28 Pressure on Iran is the desired goal. War increases oil profits.

5670 2018-05-20 18:47:04 Donald owes Putin.  The easiest way to do to pay off his debt to Russia was by ratcheting up tension in the ME, sending oil prices back up into the stratosphere.  #NothingButCollusion!  @realDonaldTrump #Resign
5671 2018-05-20 18:46:39 Used coconut oil for the first time today and I’m not impressed with the smell 
5672 2018-05-20 18:46:31 @iam_Davido sold out a place we never heard of before? Baba your head get serious oil. You motivate all us and give us hope that we can impact the world positively as Nigerian youths.

5676 2018-05-20 18:45:52 I know what it means! They were and are. Due to corruption the oil money didn’t trickle down to the general population. But to suggest for one minute that Venezuela wasn’t socialist, is ridiculous
5677 2018-05-20 18:45:48 They get me all the time Cuzzin  but the way we run that slab.... sir oil us up

5680 2018-05-20 18:45:22 AB economy and housing market has been solid the last 20 years because of oil and tax adv for small businesses imo. The socon stuff is seperate. I’m an ab party guy that’s in the middle but I don’t get the argument of why focusing on less tax is terrible for AB
5681 2018-05-20 18:45:20 We love our 1st and 2nd ladies! Now go tell hubbies that we are WOKE to truth in Middle East!! God will not bless a war based on oil or Israeli power. 
5682 2018-05-20 18:45:14 also Greek - also never saw it done like this - but I still had to take a sedative when my kids were baptized- should we tell these people that before the dunking they are doused in oil to make it all the more risky?
5683 2018-05-20 18:45:01 And whatever is recylced is made into plastic garden furniture & garbage bags, 'cause plastics can't be recycled only repurposed. Plastic recylcing would require them to be reliquified into Oil. At least burning them gives back the energy put in used to make them.
5684 2018-05-20 18:44:53 What a great feeling to not be named “Tanker Trackers”! Someone actually paid attention!  
5685 2018-05-20 18:44:50 That explains their pleasant dispositions.

5687 2018-05-20 18:44:26 I guess that Scottish oil paid for the Thames barrier & the M25 - as well as 4 million unemployed & the destruction  of the uk's industrial base
5688 2018-05-20 18:44:17 #gasprices are high b/c of under investment in increased capacity and the economic growth, which is caused by @realDonaldTrump! #oil
5689 2018-05-20 18:44:17 yes  you are correct you can't drink oil..... but as you say this wearing and using oil by products..... we can't take you seriously !!!!
5690 2018-05-20 18:43:58 NSCDC arrests 30 pipeline vandals, oil thieves in Bayelsa
5691 2018-05-20 18:43:52 Because I underestimated the value of trading oil with Iran. I also did not believe Iran would allow the IAEA observe the Iran activities. Remember, oil price dropped and the IAEA was all over Iran. It worked out fine.
5692 2018-05-20 18:43:49 Socialism is equality of opportunity and common ownership and I can't find anything about that in Venezuela. Chavez used oil money for social programs. Then the prices crashes. Along with corruption which was likely there long before Chávez, they were up against it
5693 2018-05-20 18:43:39 Fell asleep in the sun with oil on me while out on the boat and absolutely sizzled my chest! Feel like sobbing

5711 2018-05-20 18:41:06 Why don’t you tell the people that the oil to be transported by pipeline to the coast is to be sent overseas and not to refineries in Canada or the US?
5712 2018-05-20 18:41:05 I’m not your follower! I’m here because you are lobbying for #KM in the name of burning more fossil fuels and speeding up the impacts from man made climate change! I’m here because #KM is about selling oil to Asia and putting my City and my Province’s coast at risk!

5720 2018-05-20 18:40:17 Obama erred on side of caution, during the election.  Which resulted in a tacky snake oil salesman and his classless family in the WH.  Your pathetic son met with at least 2 foreign governments to swing the election.  Your campaign coordinated with Julian Assange and WHAT?????

5726 2018-05-20 18:39:32 What's in the olive oil?
5727 2018-05-20 18:39:31 Your ignorance is showing. NOTHING stated was about 'enriching'. Just your self-righteous HATEFUL rant.

5733 2018-05-20 18:38:28 Yup, mineral oil is good, that's what I use for cutting boards.
5734 2018-05-20 18:38:14 “Is that so? And what is that ‘ royals ’ name?”

He’s got everything from the fridge and is moving it all over to the stove to look for a pan and some olive oil.

5736 2018-05-20 18:38:04 Tea tree oil is good for mosquitos, but dunno about midges.
5737 2018-05-20 18:37:53 @ScienceChannel #howitsmade how are Framo pumps made? These are the pumps used on merchant oil tankers to discharge oil.
5738 2018-05-20 18:37:45 While a barrel of crude becomes more expensive, renewables become cheaper. Market conditions no longer conducive to high oil prices.  There's no peak oil, just competition.
5739 2018-05-20 18:37:26 @arunjaitley Sir oil price increase day by day, when you starting to curbe the prices hike. Need to do some necessary & serious steps & majorments.
5740 2018-05-20 18:37:07 @ASJAhq 10 years ago the United States President has attempted to personal profit from underground oil proceeds which his energy price fixed has Destroyed the World Stocks Markets and Economies. Counter-Intelligence Action of Superior King God Energy has Rescued World Economies?
5741 2018-05-20 18:36:56 Unless you own the oil companies and are willing to cut your profit it must be in the way of taxing the rich to subsidize gas
5742 2018-05-20 18:36:54 Crazy old ladies.  I don’t know what they think that accomplishes. Fake olive oil won’t freeze in there though. So I guess if she wants to keep it in there she needs some fake shit.
5743 2018-05-20 18:36:51 What about excise duty hiked while oil prices was declining.just to control fiscal deficit. @FinMinIndia has hiked about Rs.20/- which can be passed on to customers. Now it's time to pay back those benefits eaten by Government in the name of fiscal Prudence.
Now it's payback time
5744 2018-05-20 18:36:42 Sir we need to big regional giants in recycling in every avenue we can,we as citizens a nasty wasteful even fig leaves can be made to paper, lets do this now,we are no longer amounts the oil/gas heads

5751 2018-05-20 18:35:45 @KyleKulinski Nordic countries stewardship of public property- like oil- is much more capitalist than in the US. The nation's oil is managed like a private hedge fund, creating maximum wealth possible for its owners in the sovereign wealth fund.
5752 2018-05-20 18:35:43 I love OG last time I was there I asked for noodles w olive oil and it was chill plus their breadsticks are vegan which is amazing
5753 2018-05-20 18:35:42 MacGyver would fix this with eight barrels of crude oil, a suitcase full of tennis balls and a heroic quantity of duct tape.
5754 2018-05-20 18:35:40 BITCH the improvement from my first oil painting to my second one is actually insane
5755 2018-05-20 18:35:37 @FoxNewsSunday CUT OFF NORTH KOREA'S OIL AND GAS AND WE'LL SEE. LET'S SEE HOW THEY DO WHEN THAT HAPPENS. TRUMP HAS THE CUTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS. A TRUE PATRIOT.
5756 2018-05-20 18:35:35 It's the CB oil that's available in ROI and in Northern Ireland however it's not the medical cannabis little Ava Twomey is forced to travel to the Netherlands for it the HSE have agreed to reimburse expenses but refuse to prescribe it in ireland. It's cruel .
5757 2018-05-20 18:35:34 No. I meant economically. If Total extracts oil they get profits. Same airbus. What happens here?
5758 2018-05-20 18:35:29 Exactly. But there are. I major “Asian” oil producers. This would be primarily OPEC oil via Asian refineries.
5759 2018-05-20 18:35:29 In 1938, Diplomatic relations between the UK and Mexico are broken off after the UK demands final payment for oil expropriations and damage during the earlier revolution.  Mexico paid the week earlier, then shut down its mission.
5760 2018-05-20 18:35:24 am i right in thinking her ring was to do with #alba ?
5761 2018-05-20 18:35:17 When oil prices were low, the excise duty was increased. Now oil prices have reached peak levels and hence excise duty should be reduced #reducefuelprice @narendramodi @FinMinIndia
5762 2018-05-20 18:35:14 Try tea tree oil. Literally the only thing you’ll ever need
5763 2018-05-20 18:35:12 Yes. And Italians cook with olive oil all the time - some things actively require it - so to rule it out completely isn’t correct
5764 2018-05-20 18:35:07 putting conditioner and oil in my spray bottle was the best decision i ever made. 
5765 2018-05-20 18:34:49 I don’t think I can trust an oil company doing anything good without getting something in return
5766 2018-05-20 18:34:44 It not like the west ever hold them accountable for anything because of oil

5773 2018-05-20 18:34:18 These Congis and their captive channels have lost all sense of proportion.Oil sector reform is one of the most daring reforms ushered into by this govt.
Or else fiscal deficit like during UPA rule would have gone through the roof with inflation raging at high double digits.

5775 2018-05-20 18:34:09 It’s not about who I stand with, it’s about why those who do not consume mustard oil, do not grow it , live continents away feel they can insert themselves into the discussion and impose their views

5780 2018-05-20 18:33:11 Countries giving us oil are being ruled by dictatorships and there is lots of craziness in the Middle East. Nothing to do with the US and our government can’t do anything about it
5781 2018-05-20 18:33:10 So technically if oil prices keep going up, there should be correction in the market.
5782 2018-05-20 18:32:58 Not good news for Chelsea fans like me ... No one seems to think it a problem that oil sheikhs roam the world and buy football clubs.
5783 2018-05-20 18:32:58 “Major Maintenance Issues”? What are you driving? I’m driving a 2012, and outside of oil changes, wiper blades,and 1 new set of tires, I have put $0 into repairs. There’s no way you are putting $600/month of maintenance into a car......unless you drive a SAAB.
5784 2018-05-20 18:32:53 IDEA... FRENCH FRIES FRIED IN CANNABIS INFUSED COOKING OIL.

THE BEST OF BOTH WORLD'S.
5785 2018-05-20 18:32:47 First time in the last 4.5 years an AAPian is not blaming Modi for something!! Thankfully it's the intl crude oil prices. Has the sun has risen from the WEST 
5786 2018-05-20 18:32:45 Infused stewed rhubarb. 
At 375mg, you can really taste the oil. 
My dad would probably recommend adding raisins; but I hate hose little buggers.

5788 2018-05-20 18:31:54 Spills are rare until they happen, why take the risk when we need to ditch fossil fuels anyway. The oil industry is full of talented people who could work in renewables #KinderMorgan #oiljobs #YYC #greenjobs
5789 2018-05-20 18:31:54 Not exactly-Israel supplies Gaza all its initial need to survive [water. electricity, food, oil, gas, internet]. Egypt almost null. Even though Hamas attacked and ruined the main border gate of Kerem Shalom and bombed the need gas pipe that brings it into Gaza. Its rediculous
5790 2018-05-20 18:31:36 Can BC turn off water support to #alberta if @RachelNotley turns off Oil ?

5791 2018-05-20 18:31:29 first to address your list. No one wants to live in the #Tarsands no matter how nice the house is.
You had your chance. BC doesn't want to contribute to your pollution. We will be getting our gas and oil from the USA for less $
5792 2018-05-20 18:31:26 I got an oil change and car wash this weekend and my gas tank is full.. one could say I’m a pretty responsible adult
5793 2018-05-20 18:31:18 The special today starts with  Saganaki as the appetizer and then as the main dish tangy Beer soup with  Olive oil to drink.
5794 2018-05-20 18:31:18 Sir oil price increase day by day, when you starting to curbe the prices hike. Need to do some necessary & serious steps & majorments.
5795 2018-05-20 18:31:10 Yes, oil purchase done by oil ministry... eg. ordered 100 barrel on paper received only 70-80 barrel,
Considering the facts 1 barrel crude oil can produce 40 to 70 lts of petrol + other products, depending on quality of crude oil. manipulation are easy. 
heard of swiss bank a/c..
5796 2018-05-20 18:30:58 Bush & Blair went to war because of Oil
5797 2018-05-20 18:30:57 They left the oil companies in a mess. Just look at the BS of the companies post deregulation till 2014 .

5803 2018-05-20 18:30:09 They turned out great. A little work to prep and put on the grill but totally worth it. I used olive oil, sault and pepper. I also put them on first and took off last. #yummy

5814 2018-05-20 18:28:10 There was no oil boom before the civil war which escalated for 30months and threatened our corporate existence as a nation. The argument should be anchored on regional govt that made Nigeria to prosper as a result of competition hence the advent of military rule into unitary govt

5827 2018-05-20 18:26:29 @jiffylube  Needed an oil change yesterday in Mabelton, Ga. Dude told me that the price of an oil change would start at $74.99.  That's insane for a job you guys can do in 10 minutes.
5828 2018-05-20 18:26:28 what you would have done when curde oil prises increasimg?
5829 2018-05-20 18:26:06 How do you think the huge losses of oil companies mostly in the PSU were managed. When gov was regulating and fiddling with prices and forcing oil industries to bear the losses. Once it's left to make forces someone has to restore that gap, right?
5830 2018-05-20 18:25:55 @ukenyatta @williamsruto kudos your excellencies on the petroleum bill which will impact the transport and construction industries immensly, perhaps we should consider an 'ethanol oil mix' targeting sugar subsector of agriculture as well as environment due to renewable energy.
5831 2018-05-20 18:25:54 #EiSamay Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan today said the increase in fuel prices was due to reduced production of oil in Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

5836 2018-05-20 18:24:37 Btw, crude oil price is almost 50% of what it used to be a few years ago. More than 100-105 to 50-60!

5850 2018-05-20 18:22:29 I first moved to Casper when I was in high school in the 80s it was crazy! 
Huge town out in the middle of no where with tons of Oil money. It was really surreal. In a few short years they closed down oil jobs and killed the town. Casper today looks nothing like it did then.
5851 2018-05-20 18:22:16 Good for you, that you're getting closer to being self sufficient. But 3.7 million barrels every day is still a HUGE amount of oil 
5852 2018-05-20 18:22:08 You need US Embassy running that country, don't be so modest.
The proven oil reserves in Venezuela are recognized as the largest in the world, totaling 297 billion barrels.
 Plain and simple why You are trying to implement US vision of "democracy" in other countries.

5867 2018-05-20 18:21:01 Blackrose mask is A+. Can't use it daily because skin has the propensity to breakout w/ too much oil. Having said this, which moisturizer shld I use? Dry n winter months while summer months require less oil. I use Buff N Wash almost daily. Best cleanser/exfoliator ever!
5868 2018-05-20 18:20:32 Bingo. Even just an upgrade to synthetic crude oil would be reasonable. They'd ship it with the dirt in it if they could.
5869 2018-05-20 18:19:50 Not sure this is quite why their social programmes are not working. Could be more to do with social overspend due to economic mismanagement driven by over reliance on revenues of one sector (in their case oil). Not sure this economic failure has2anything to do w/socialism per se.
5870 2018-05-20 18:19:45 We should have an oil reserve monetry fund too, our water is just a lucrative......
5871 2018-05-20 18:19:44 Girl yes, it’s amazing! I even used the lemon oil infused shower before I left lmao we gotta have a spa date here one day
5872 2018-05-20 18:19:43 It's lighter than 14 levels. I'd just as soon keep it like that until Project Connect delivers or peak oil strikes or robot cars finally turn the corner ~*OR*~ they at least build the plinth to be convertible.
5873 2018-05-20 18:19:31 Monopolies are a real thing though and an issue. If people on the left keep acting liek Twitter, Facebook and Google aren't problematic it might drive people to the right more or at least towards the libertarians who promise more freedom and fairness (even though snake oil)
5874 2018-05-20 18:19:29 That is kinda the point yes.  If you are worried about the environment and do not like the oil industry and their so called crimes then yes stop using the products would be a logical first step.
5875 2018-05-20 18:19:27 PS In case you wondered, I used a 50/50 mix of Argan oil and Kukui oil after watching it for a week and seeing that it was not getting any bigger. 14 days won't make a huge difference one way or the other health wise, but can save you a ton of money--your choice, as I said.

5880 2018-05-20 18:19:03 Yes Corbyn used the Venezuelan model as an example to follow and it was a flawed argument even at the time (when they weren't yet in the mist of crisis caused by faltering oil prices) - though the idea of controlling the nations resources nationally to benefit the nation is fair.

5887 2018-05-20 18:18:08 even you did sir , its due to international dynamics that we see price rise in oil sector ...we need not blame govt for this its beyond any govts capacity ..all they can do is to reduce excise but that will widen fd of govt so lets see when its plummeting !!
5888 2018-05-20 18:17:54 asked my mom what the difference was between extra virgin olive oil and regular olive oil and she has the NERVE to go “it’s olive oil that hasn’t had sex yet” 
5889 2018-05-20 18:17:47 Of course not!  Coal Companies are lobbying and maybe bribing this president. Strange fact- Koch brother's dad made his money off of creating a cracking method-crude into gas/oil. They have big money invested with this president.  YIKES Vote please in Nov 2018

5894 2018-05-20 18:17:12 It's a choice and I like driving.  By the way, stop heating your house in winter and stop using oil by-products while your at it.  Your bullshit can only go so far.
5895 2018-05-20 18:16:52 Incidentally I've nothing against using oil but it isn't required. Butter is a sin though unless you're trying to disguise poor quality beef.

5908 2018-05-20 18:14:46 According to the NBR, three elements could slow down the U.S. economy. 1) higher interest rates coming, 2) higher oil prices and 3) a stronger dollar. Be advised and good time for savings accounts, but slows consumer spending.

5913 2018-05-20 18:14:12 Fuck Back To The Oil Field Monday  !
5914 2018-05-20 18:13:58 TAX the rich who DO NOT PAY THEIR FARE SHARE, TAX the oil companies, TAX the corporations who avoid paying taxes (yes, as an Apple fan-boy—Apple better pay more of their share). And close the fucking loopholes!
5915 2018-05-20 18:13:57 Another gift to Putin from Trump Admin. Sanctions on Venezuelan oil just hands Russia more market share as well as driving up global price.
5916 2018-05-20 18:13:45 You can't make a Spanish omelette without olive oil.

5920 2018-05-20 18:13:09 and what would make oil prices go through the roof?  war with Iran that's what.
5921 2018-05-20 18:12:55 Had an all around grey Saturday, went on a late night excursion to & came back feeling a bit better. The kicker was waking up this morning, turning on my oil diffuser, declaring it #SelfLoveSunday , running a green tea bath & listening to @blackgirlinom to get my life back

5923 2018-05-20 18:12:49 One winter, I left an almost-full bottle of canola oil at the cottage. Returned in spring to find the lid chewed off and a dozen adult mice drowned inside. Still not sure how that worked out, displacement-wise, nor how they squeezed through the narrow neck.

5926 2018-05-20 18:12:26 Russia wanted the oil prices to rise too.

5931 2018-05-20 18:11:51 There have always been snake oil pedlars and likely always will. I feel very deeply that we bear significant responsibility and need to get better at communicating with the public - on vaccines, AMR, GM crops, etc.
5932 2018-05-20 18:11:47 I didn't say that at all. I said: "You can't prove the economic future of any country."

Anyone can make a prediction,but they're unreliable hence economists failed to predict banking crisis, Osborne failed to predict £72bn deficit and Salmond failed to predict falling oil prices

5934 2018-05-20 18:11:39 we import crude oil to refine, we also exporting crude oil. it doesn't make sense to me. why not just sell the excess?
5935 2018-05-20 18:11:36 My point is more nuanced and I lack nothing on the minutiae. If a crude oil spill in Vancouver is inevitable and catastrophic (it’s not), the silence of BC politicians on the Alaskan trade carrying more harmful cargo in equally risky ships raises awkward questions.
5936 2018-05-20 18:11:08 @afrisoDE but you have to go through @AfrisoEurogauge in England. It’s combined deaerator and oil filter. Can be mounted left or right. I particularly like the vacuum gauge showing when the filter needs to be replaced
5937 2018-05-20 18:10:56 Bent crude oil yesterday price is $48 it's totally lie....Don't cover-up the elections money by cheat with innocent people or democracy
5938 2018-05-20 18:10:49 Sir, actually with that income, the present govt reduced the debt burden which the country had to pay for importing oil. Now the govt is trying to reduce the duties.

and liquid of choice, like (plant) milk or water to make a batter
Fry with a little oil
Bonus: Add chocolate chips

5953 2018-05-20 18:08:37 Mr.VonTopfer Zapatero is one of the men in favour of 155 against Catalunya. These people try to fix things in Venezuela ( remember, country with oil) when they have a mess in their own country Spain. Can you imagine how do catalans feel right now?
5954 2018-05-20 18:08:29 Yes I am surprised it was that high. We have a PV array on our house and over a 12 month period it pays our annual electric bill (excluding AS heat pump) plus we use an iBoost to also give us free hot water from May - Sep. No gas or oil used at all - ever. Kinda good feeling

5957 2018-05-20 18:07:48 We bribed other countries to follow our lead against Soviet-lead communism.  We guaranteed Middle East peace when we relied upon oil imports.  The Soviet threat disintegrated and America produces more oil than Saudi Arabia.  No matter who’s Pres., expect further US disengagement
5958 2018-05-20 18:07:47 Olive oil is fine for steak. You’ll do far more damage to the (potential) flavour using a not-particularly-hot pan than rubbing it in a not-quite-ideal oil.

It has way more to do with the price of oil and the oil companies finding more efficiencies.

5963 2018-05-20 18:07:06 @SenateGOP We need lower gas prices to get to jobs. Rural Michigan depends on farming and tourist. More jobs are coming but hw do we get there? Gas, oil changes etc. We and other states do not have good public transportation. Small town businesses are owned and operated by family

5967 2018-05-20 18:06:13 Oh get this. No oil. Garage has no smell. No brake pads — an engineering trick slows it down. When I go down hill, wheels charge the battery. It’s weird science. No tune ups. My future maintenance is only tires, battery, electronics. Like a golf cart. A charge equals a lamp.
5968 2018-05-20 18:06:04 Hillary is not running for office in 2018 or 2020 or ever again. I see no point in condemning or defending her today.  TODAY the super rich, domestic & from around the world are effectively in control of our government. It's big oil from Saudia's, UAL, Russia, etc.
5969 2018-05-20 18:06:02 Rub a little olive oil to the skins before you add them to the oven (I find gas  oven spuds smell and taste better than electric oven) they smell a little nicer and have a nice crisp shell

5982 2018-05-20 18:04:22 I know that's been touted a lot, but I learned recently that it takes billions & yrs to build a refinery & oil co.s are not committed to that. Seems like a bit of a WTH lack of commitment, considering these long-term benefits they're advertising. Strange they wont invest in this.

5987 2018-05-20 18:03:28 better way to do this is actually to grill the onions and then sautee the uncooked rice, garlic, clove and onion mixture in olive oil for about a minute before cooking the rice normally - my suggestion would actually be using a Dutch oven and baking for 15 minutes on 350

6000 2018-05-20 18:02:23 The rebuttal is the sudden inclusion of both upstream as well as downstream emissions on the environmental assessment, something that had never been done, and something that foreign oil is not subjected to. Energy East was cancelled within days of that decision. Coincidence? Sure

6016 2018-05-20 18:00:59 Compare the petrol and diesel prices in India with the neighbouring countries. O.K.  now the prices of petrol and diesel are hiked because of less production by OPEC and hike in crude oil price. Have you decreased the price of oils when the crude oil price was down to earth.

6043 2018-05-20 17:58:02 Why are prices of petrol raising day by day ,when the prices of crude oil is at the minimum?? Very upset with  the government and governance. I voted for BJP in 2014 and now I think my vote is wasted @PMOIndia
6044 2018-05-20 17:58:02 15 years ago: I meant to post this a couple days ago. Once the vehicles and the Marines were loaded, the ships departed Kuwaiti waters and started the journey towards home. At night you could see the oil derricks that were numerous in the area.
6045 2018-05-20 17:57:50 Great move!! I think that as the price of a barrel of oil reaches $80 perhaps you should let Saudi Arabia know that it is time to open the flood gates of supply. Just saying.
6046 2018-05-20 17:57:49 Like everyone swear they know everything... ok smart ass, what’s in Que oil since you got the answers and crack codes to life 
6047 2018-05-20 17:57:48 Literally been fixing my car since 10am and I’ve oil all over me broke a nail and pretty sure I have sun stroke. Lesson learnt make sure you slow down for speed bump 
6048 2018-05-20 17:57:40 lol. Cafe Javas should definately consider listing to fund its expansion (even to locations outside Uganda). Is Cafe Javas expanding through City Oil money? hmm. A tax deductible loan maybe?
6049 2018-05-20 17:57:38 .2019 oil exploration for private companies abolished. It must be nations wealth. Allow processing rights to private companies

6055 2018-05-20 17:56:57 Oh man, that was me all last week. Worst fucking pain in existence!! Gargoyle mouth wash & clove oil.. that really kept the pain away, temporarily. And take antibiotics. It should help. Recover soon.

6059 2018-05-20 17:56:34 Oooh, seems the oil/seasoning method is the way forwards. I normally just prick ‘em and leave them. 

2hrs though? I give mine 60mins, any longer and I start getting far too hungry and begin to cry! 
6060 2018-05-20 17:56:14 You want them to offer the oil for u!!
6061 2018-05-20 17:56:01 Nothing to show or prove here. Just my resistance to the hatred and violence by the left.

6065 2018-05-20 17:55:00 Why is crude oil not mentioned? China has been ramping up their imports from the US quick, and US exports are structurally growing. Currently US  exports of crude are around 2million bpd. By 2020 that should double. 2million bpd of exports to China would be $58 billion of value
6066 2018-05-20 17:54:59 I needa go get a oil change
6067 2018-05-20 17:54:58 The right answer is no oil or butter at all.

6073 2018-05-20 17:54:37 Plausible denial merely pointing out the facts is another rebel media talking point before sliding into their free speech right to attack immigrants. Another "comparison" to use would be billions in oil subsidies credits & incentives. Don't  have to use immigrants.
6074 2018-05-20 17:54:36 its funny how a norwegian cares where we get our oil
6075 2018-05-20 17:54:34 He was referring to oil seed rape which many believe causes respiratory issues.  @sevenbarrows pays a considerable sum each year for farmer to not plant it next to gallops. I agree it's a bit 'boy who cried wolf' but worth remembering previous excuses came from owner not trainer.
6076 2018-05-20 17:54:32 @fordnation .10 a litre tax cut shows lack of imagination. It's insignificant to we paying near $100 to fill up. Oil co's will just absorb it and continue to raise prices. Taxpayers will have to foot the $1B bill while pollution is unabated. Think!
6077 2018-05-20 17:54:23 yer cos the rich fuckers in Venezuela haven't been doing their best to shaft the country so they can show how much of a fail it was, problem is, they were not successful and now oil price is going up again Venezuela will prob be ok again.
6078 2018-05-20 17:54:23 Coconut oil only!
6079 2018-05-20 17:54:07 Fuel prices were deregulated from May 2017. Oil firms had to recover previous losses due to subsidy. Also central govt increased excise.
6080 2018-05-20 17:53:51 Asked about what is understood about the corruption but answers about our investment, oil and gas in relation with the environment which means there was no understanding about the concept of the corruption and the status of our country.

6086 2018-05-20 17:53:02 I thought you consumed a lot more oil than you produced, and had to import a lot because of it.
Has that changed in the last couple of years?
6087 2018-05-20 17:53:01 Gettn my oil change now.. 
6088 2018-05-20 17:52:42 You started it lol. Am now trying to work out what I can get from the petrol station to go with the custard, also from the petrol station.

Corbyns dress sense has ironically led directly to an oil company with questionable tax procedures making more money.

Realistic Socialism.
6089 2018-05-20 17:52:32 not talking bout lean but we got that mud im selling oil
6090 2018-05-20 17:52:31 Yeah, Russia has trump supporters too. Look how he's helping their economy with the cost of oil. Have you earned enough for a bottle of vodka yet? I'm willing to respond a few more times, to get you there. You just have to let me know.
6091 2018-05-20 17:52:25 The state of Canada™ 2018 amid suicide and opioid crises on reserve they are pushing oil sands pipelines through unceded territories.

6094 2018-05-20 17:51:44 Thiem and Zverev will challenge him in @rolandgarros, but if you say within 2 months... I think he will save his energy after Paris like Federer.
6095 2018-05-20 17:51:40 We do leave foot prints and that's exactly what we were trying to reduce with the Paris agreement, but it was not beneficial for oil and coal companies witch lined trips pockets 1+1=2 renewable energy cost hos donors money!
6096 2018-05-20 17:51:33 well i’m glad you’ve realised now i would recommend putting coconut oil on them

6100 2018-05-20 17:51:13 When petrol price was down... Hon Leader took all credits and claimed people sd elect the person under whose regime international crude oil price is reducing.... Wonder what he would say now!!!
6101 2018-05-20 17:51:01 Facts: (according to that article) oil demand is rising; Ireland uses almost no oil to generate electricity; oil is used in heating & for fuels; to have wind help reduce oil consumption, we need electric heating & EVs. If u actually want to find the problem, that's where to look
6102 2018-05-20 17:50:54 Oh please. It’s not unsustainable. Let a few million ppl have their own state. It’s well deserved AND should be a beacon to the rest of the surrounding countries how a modern economy & democracy could thrive in a region of theocracies, dictatorships & oil dependent backwaters

6106 2018-05-20 17:50:19 I think he has the ability to find out the answer to his "questions" outside of twitter.  He's not asking questions though,  he's putting oil in the water so when it all comes crumbling down people will still have doubt.

6120 2018-05-20 17:48:39 This after ruling for the oil sand pipeline immediately upon taking office, which produces a much higher rate of pollutants into OUR air when refined. Those who could care less about our environment care even less about us our money woes.
6121 2018-05-20 17:48:38 Only the dumb ones! There’s still plenty of people who haven’t bought the snake oil 
6122 2018-05-20 17:48:37 Quite mind boggling.  When you think about it, it surely goes well beyond oil as well.  Thinking nuclear, banking, technology, etc.  Every commercial facet of modern life likely an unGodly gnarl of multi-national elitists swilling at the trough. Throw in some black market too.
6123 2018-05-20 17:48:36 I make my own lava using smashed highlight and coconut oil . I mix it together than I apply to my skin .
6124 2018-05-20 17:48:33 Daddy Trump should have considered some of the cons of becoming a con man, grifter, snake oil salesman, crook and rapist before he embarked on this nonsense.
6125 2018-05-20 17:48:24 I believe Trump would have helped you, except for your Phoenix car. He is pro oil company. Instead of repair CDs, let's make virtual CDs that run operating systems on them and only use the hard drive for memory. Then we can put the anti virus companies out of business.

6127 2018-05-20 17:48:18 I actually agree with some of the points, and I have said we need to diversify our economy. That doesn't mean we need to abandon oil&gas. It means we need to spend or money during those boom times to diversity. I agree PCs spent like drunk sailors. It was insane.
6128 2018-05-20 17:48:18 Oil is the reason US wants allies in ME.

6134 2018-05-20 17:47:45 I’m afraid I don’t agree with you, Christina. First of all, extra virgin shouldn’t go anywhere near a frying pan except in marinades. For pot-cooking a light olive oil can be used and for “ladera” extra virgin should be added at the end of cooking or drizzled on the served plate.
6135 2018-05-20 17:47:43 Wondering if you think it possible Carter Page,who already worked for FBI taking bugged binders to Russia oil ministry) or Pappadopolous could actually been imbedded to assure Obama spy access to all of campaign,FISAs on FBI’s own people? Can’t help thinking something is missing

6139 2018-05-20 17:46:47 Plus a lot has changed in ND since 2012 when she first won there was the oil boom that brought in a lot of white men that likely lean conservative and the Dakota Access pipeline hurt her relationship with Indian Country a bit. So she has to be really careful.
6140 2018-05-20 17:46:45 "PHONY" LOL...bess your heart....

- Verified: Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page met with representatives of Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft.

Verified: The Kremlin targeted educated youth and swing state voters during its cyber attacks in the 2016 campaign.

6143 2018-05-20 17:46:11 Don't think it was the oil, but the military centralization of the oi revenue mainly through Obasanjo's land use decree. If the oil producing regions had contributed a portion of the revenue other regions would have had to develop their own internal revenue streams.

6146 2018-05-20 17:46:03 Traitor Trump Has Handed Control Of The East To China & The West To Putin. Oil Rich Nations Are Surging Back Into Power And Crushing Any Hopes Of Democracy In Those Nations.

6147 2018-05-20 17:46:03 And what happened to all the talk about "not relying on foreign oil"? I know there's plenty enough in reserves and with advent of electric cars (though not everyone is using them) surely the govt could help, but that would hurt Dumps friends-can't have that
6148 2018-05-20 17:45:57  mate oxo cube mashed in oil smothered over it and throw it in the grill, easy
6149 2018-05-20 17:45:50 Coconut oil on hair and skin. It's  Safe to call it a day.
6150 2018-05-20 17:45:45 Lets hope oil picks up pretty soon then your back in business
6151 2018-05-20 17:45:44 Yes, I'm sure Iran is extremely happy that they will no longer be able to export oil or do business with so many countries in Europe. I'm sure their economy will thrive selling oil to China as the US continues to expand its export capacity along with Libya, Iraq, & Saudi Arabia.
6152 2018-05-20 17:45:40 there is no greater feeling than getting out of the shower and slapping vitamin e oil and body butter all over yaself

6155 2018-05-20 17:45:08 Can't believe I've just poured olive oil into my ear to unblock it and it worked. Sundays are the best days
6156 2018-05-20 17:45:02 ME countries accounted for the highest dollar value worth of crude oil exports during 2017 with shipments valued at $356.3 billion or 42.4% of globally exported crude oil. At the continent level, almost half comes from countries in Asia (49.4%).
6157 2018-05-20 17:44:59 Union Minister #DharmendraPradhan has said the hike in the fuel prices is due to the less production of oil in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (#OPEC) and hike in crude oil price in the international market
6158 2018-05-20 17:44:58 I genuinely don’t know what I’d do if I didn’t have coconut oil in my life

6160 2018-05-20 17:44:39 It is, by the way, the best time for them to stick it in, whilst the EU is on the back foot & flirting with mullahs in Iran to keep them in power for few more days for little bit cheaper oil & frozen billions oil monies.
6161 2018-05-20 17:44:33 That’s a lot of petroleum products kinda makes this seem like it’s not about oil at all. #hypocrites
6162 2018-05-20 17:44:19 Oil King gonna come for that Juri ass
6163 2018-05-20 17:44:18 It seems that it relied on high oil prices so when they fell it went to shit. In addition to corruption the country went off a cliff.

6165 2018-05-20 17:44:12 U saved me the effort, thanks 
Don't blame the oil, was a gift from God, even with the agric Nd our mentality, we'll still spoil it
6166 2018-05-20 17:44:12 ....And off his friends bottom line. That’s another example of graft and corruption in his administration. President Obama didn’t have any stocks in coal mines or oil companies. He did the right thing and divested when he took office. Donny continues to prosper off us.

6184 2018-05-20 17:42:12 Yes, in the country of excess which will collapse when oil prices rise again. In normal sized countries smaller cars will still continue to exist.

2. Where did all the money come from? there isn't an unlimited supply...did stlin steal a lot of it and them pass it down to successors? or is it more recent oil money?

6194 2018-05-20 17:41:21 There is an oil inside you that if protected flows from your brain down your spine and then rests for 2.5 days. If you don't have a sexual release during this time and are peaceful it rises back to the brain and you meet GOD. Jacob calls this the land of pineal in the bible. #eye
6195 2018-05-20 17:41:20 My 36-year-old son told me this during the summer of 2016 - Mom, let me explain this to you simply, Petro-dollars. This is about oil and they don't want Hillary to win. He reads a lot and he was right about that.
6196 2018-05-20 17:41:15 WMDs we sold him in the 80s. Why go take it back 20 years later? Oh, he decided not to trade his oil on the US dollar.
6197 2018-05-20 17:41:13 I got off work early Friday and just knew I was going to get my oil changed... went straight to sleep. Got off work early yesterday... chose to sleep . This is what happens when they say I can just walk-in and no appt necessary.
6198 2018-05-20 17:41:13 In 2018 why should the US Gov subsidize Planned Parent Hood, Farmers, Tobacco Farmers, PBS, the ARTS, private institutions of Education, anyone or anything on Wall Street, coal, the auto industry, banking,oil, solar or wind power...FREE MARKET should set prices.

6203 2018-05-20 17:40:07 Venezuela is sitting on the world’s largest supply of oil reserves, yet her people are starving. How many generations are going to need to prove communism does not work. Boggles the mind.

Oil prices rising and burning the pockets of the common man please reduce the duties before people feels betrayed supporting BJP in 2014. Bring fuel under GST and better the lives of the common man.

6214 2018-05-20 17:38:10 There's so much oil in the ground we'd burn all the oxygen before the oil ran out
6215 2018-05-20 17:38:06 @realDonaldTrump Why are gas prices so high?  The pipelines were opened, we have fracking everywhere, and off oil drilling at its peak.  So why are we paying $3.00 a gallon??????Get out of global market.
6216 2018-05-20 17:37:48 He drove a Rover, there was probably more oil dripping out of the fucking thing than there was in it
6217 2018-05-20 17:37:47 Actually I can see it looks really heathy and shinny. You use any oil/mask??
6218 2018-05-20 17:37:27 Answer is defensive & not explored other possibilities. His task to reduce oil price at consumer end, reduce oil import with time target.
6219 2018-05-20 17:37:18 I think our PM already announce about tganu oil royalti before this kan?
6220 2018-05-20 17:37:18 I can only hope @INCIndia hits the ground against oil price rise. Has to be a pan India bandh and protest

6224 2018-05-20 17:36:57 Obama stuck a deal with Saudis to keep oil $ down and $$ out of the hands of the Russians.

Trump has struck a deal with the new Saudi Prince and Putin to jack up oil $, and give the Russians and Saudis more capital.  American working class screwed.

6229 2018-05-20 17:36:27 in Kerala the indigenous  coconut oil prices have touched Rs.257/ltr from 145, nobody has any problem. but when the imported petrol prices have gone up everybody is crying as if they are drinking petrol/diesel only

6231 2018-05-20 17:35:58 But they always put out charts and graphs to show why instead of just calling it what it is, PRICE FIXING COLLUSION.  Remember not so many years ago we were at "peak oil" and the prices were predicted to be $5 a gallon by now (based on charts and graphs!)?

6236 2018-05-20 17:35:08 Government must give incentives to manufacturers to produce EVs at mass scale & drive its sales by giving incentives even to buyers by waiving off road tax & GST.
Benefits:
1. Production will boost employment & economy
2. Save country's money by low purchase of oil from gulf.
6237 2018-05-20 17:34:59 Fact of the Day: John D. Rockefeller bought out his partner, Maurice Clark, for $72,500 in 1865 for complete control of Standard Oil. Rockefeller also took out a $100,000 in 1863 to acquire smaller refineries.
6238 2018-05-20 17:34:54 Now that oil prices are picking up, when do we start vying for commercial purposes?

6242 2018-05-20 17:34:30 Oh Jeremy Corbyn. But John McDonnell says it's not socialism, somehow it was all good when Chavez was running the show (and oil was $150 per dollar)
6243 2018-05-20 17:34:27 Scrap Iran deal, which destabilizes the oil market so Russia can make more $$

6248 2018-05-20 17:33:59 Does the US produce more oil than they use, at this point? That's what I mean by either oil-producing or oil-consuming.

6253 2018-05-20 17:33:27 @INCIndia Of course you have zero knowledge of how global petrol pricing works, well just google it. You just want to stuff people with subsidised food and oil and milk the poor taxpayers, right?
6254 2018-05-20 17:33:25 VZans underclasses can just look at Brazil or Mexico to see how oil crisis will be handled if opposition takes hold and who will pay the price. Or they can watch the results of "fair" elections in Honduras or Argentina to see what is in store.
6255 2018-05-20 17:33:17 Tom, may I ask who the artist is? I was just visiting NYC and saw similar oil paintings for sale in the Central Park mall and can’t seem to find the vendor / artist.
6256 2018-05-20 17:33:15 Will u explain people why Congress during UPA2 didn't paid IRAN for oil import and the 1000s of Cr pending payment was landed on Modi in 2014?
6257 2018-05-20 17:33:11 Oil rich gulf states are actually worse than Jews.. Arabs know it .. an Iraqi colleague told me 
Kuwaiti Gulf Arabs are the Jews of Arab world while Egypt is the prostitute .. I am repeating what I was told many years ago when Iraq was attacked .. I forget what he called Saudis

6260 2018-05-20 17:32:25 Trudeau was quick to lie to Canadian Natives about the oil pipe line.  Meanwhile hes apologizing for every crime Canada committed.  I want to see more then an apology from this pervert.
6261 2018-05-20 17:32:16 I am sure if you are Zverev, you will not think so.
6262 2018-05-20 17:32:14 GS/Saudi/Western engineered oil price collapse would have hit any VZen government hard. What would the opposition policies have been? "Washington Consensus" for sure. Then there is the US sabotage of VZ economy  Not that Chavez/Maduro polices don't have a share of the blame.
6263 2018-05-20 17:32:11 With the continuous inconsiderate action of people, oil spills, pouring paint down drains, extreme use of chemicals, etc... not to mention car accidents/fuel and oil washed away by rain, to only name a minimal amount of contaminants, NO! I highly highly doubt any water is clean

6266 2018-05-20 17:31:12 The Internet us an essential commodity like air, electricity and oil. The fact that telcos make deals with politicians to keep their prices high for everything is criminal. The tech age is here and now. You're either leading, creating or buying. These ppl can't see past greed.
6267 2018-05-20 17:30:58 In limelight of Karnataka no one is talking about macro economical factors. Indian economy is facing challenges.
1. Crude oil price at $ 80/barrel.
2. Rupee is at 68 against dollar.
3. Bond yield at 7.80.
4. Average corporate earning of Q4 of FY 17-18.

6270 2018-05-20 17:30:54 OK.    Iran is such a large country with many trading partners and oil.  You really need a lot of international consensus to squeeze it to a breaking point.  Or so I think.

6273 2018-05-20 17:30:24 That will be Marxist economic policies combined with spending oil wealth like a drunken sailor on shore leave. The only reason Venezuela was solvent was their oil reserves, without those they have sunk and fast

6280 2018-05-20 17:30:05 Why petrol & diesel price didn’t increased during Karnataka election even though the crude oil price increased.  That itself shows the prices can be controlled
6281 2018-05-20 17:30:00 Me, I tried the oil and it worked within 3 days.   If you don't want to try the oil first and possibly save money, it's up to you.

Illegal border crossings at 17yr low. Domestic oil prod @ record highs. No more ACA mandate penalty. & no collusion. Life’s good.
6285 2018-05-20 17:29:47 then why are you changing the oil ?   LOL
6286 2018-05-20 17:29:45 Why petrol & diesel price didn’t increased during Karnataka election even though the crude oil price increased.  That itself shows the prices can be controlled
6287 2018-05-20 17:29:43 I massaged coconut oil into my face last night instead of moisturizer and when I tell you she feels more supple and moisturized than she’s been in a while...
6288 2018-05-20 17:29:40 No. That doesn't show how good it is. That's what it IS. All they did is put it in photoshop/gimp and cartoonify it, use the oil painting filter and added some more filters. This is a replay screen.
(I edit photos)
6289 2018-05-20 17:29:40 No problem. Also, the primary reason we have low fuel prices is because we produce a lot of oil domestically and local gas refineries keep transportation costs low. Our Govt doesn’t subsidize oil or gas production directly.

How are the oil rich gulf states even agreeing to the bullshit peddled by Trump and Netanyahu?
6294 2018-05-20 17:29:02 Infra push is fine but voters need this
1. Bring Oil under GST
2. Free Hindu temples from govt   control
3. Raise IT slab to 5 lac
4. Build Ram Mandir 
5. Amend 370 & 35 A
Public sentiment should be respected & opposition needs to be stumped with such strong positive steps !!

6296 2018-05-20 17:28:55 Sex prevents shootings? What an amazing theory. Does it also prevent the spread of STDs and AIDS? In case Trump is reading this, or someone is, more likely, reading it to him, an STD is not the same as GTX, which is a motor oil.

6299 2018-05-20 17:28:36 Like looking at countries with oil? I just paid $3 for a gallon of gas. I'll wait for a full and fair investigation, but, jeez, three bucks seems high and maybe not coincidental.
6300 2018-05-20 17:28:32 I can't believe she's 15 years younger than me! I'mm no oil painting but I sure as hell look younger than her!

6306 2018-05-20 17:27:24 Yes in general you fast overnight, take a bunch of epsom salts, wait take some more, this loosens the bile ducts, (some people take grapefruit)then you drink olive oil which stimulates the gall bladder to contract. And you pass stones.  Read others experiences first.

6308 2018-05-20 17:26:59 Forty five years of Conservative rule, and one little oil recession came close to creaming us. And now they want to "take Alberta back from those nasty NDP communists."

Good grief, I hope Albertans aren't that dumb.
6309 2018-05-20 17:26:58 I am curious how these oil prospects will be utilized.. Both for the people of Turkana and as a nation
6310 2018-05-20 17:26:53 Local leaders =bloodsuckers in this case of Turkana oil
6311 2018-05-20 17:26:44 Put my attraction spray & fast money oil on my work shirt. Store been open less than 2 hrs & I already hit my sales goal without even trying.
6312 2018-05-20 17:26:39 I will oil you up. 
6313 2018-05-20 17:26:39 This is a great example of how the left operates: attack, insult, and slander. Because they can never win on actually debating the issues.
6314 2018-05-20 17:26:35 So where should I pack the oil?
6315 2018-05-20 17:26:16 What's going on What'sapp :

* ATM will be closed due to ransomware attack  
* Pakistan State Oil is giving warning Kay aapa petrol tang phat jaye ga.
* Weather update, that temperature will rise to 50°c

What's going on Facebook : 
* Royal wedding
* Yanny vs. Laurel debate
6316 2018-05-20 17:26:10 I put coconut oil in my hair and now the delicious smell is following me everywhere. Nom 
6317 2018-05-20 17:26:06 #Agriculture Would Have Made More Sense, Glad There Is A Gradual Reversal In Dependence On Oil With More Emphasis On Farming.
6318 2018-05-20 17:25:56 dont make the server where if you donate you're like crazily op with op jobs because that wont be fun and wont be fair to others. i'd like to see meth dealing, weed, oil, and printers those 4 would be a nice selection of making money and for jobs be creative not just basic jobs
6319 2018-05-20 17:25:56 Yup makes sense to import oil from Saudi Arabia
Let’s not bring pipelines to the Maritime Provinces to make Canada self-sufficient from Foreign oil
Where Human Rights are not recognized, like : Women Rights, Slavery, Freedom of Press etc
Trudeau hypocrite feminism & environment
6320 2018-05-20 17:25:55 Do you know when and who derugulated oil pricing?
6321 2018-05-20 17:25:48 ICE transportation & single use plastics wastes oil you are preciously defending. It’s hard on our environment & we are already spending billions more on its effects on climate change. We will need oil well into future but must dovetail renewables immediately & conserve oil use
6322 2018-05-20 17:25:41 Shea butter and bio oil x
6323 2018-05-20 17:25:29 Might as well be snake oil right? :)
6324 2018-05-20 17:25:24 For youthful skin, mix 1 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup oatmeal, 1/4 cup mashed figs, 1 oz vanilla. Leave on 20 mins.
6325 2018-05-20 17:24:58 So nice to just pour olive oil on to a spoon and drink it.
6326 2018-05-20 17:24:49 Do you pay attention to gas prices ? Every long weekend since christ was in diapers means gas prices go up. This is not done by govt but by big oil. Shell made abt $40 BILLION in profits last year. Shell loves long weekends great for gouging drivers
6327 2018-05-20 17:24:49 Is there any relation between karnataka election and crude oil price.
6328 2018-05-20 17:24:45 Don't try to be cute Andrew it doesn't suit you.

Venezuela is in trouble financially for one reason only, because the price of oil is low.

6331 2018-05-20 17:24:14 Tea tree oil is amazing for that!!
6332 2018-05-20 17:23:52 That‘s definitely so, and I feel sorry for my fellow Americans living at home, since the price of oil has risen due to ‚human‘ (i.e. trumpian) dumbness. - Or should I say it‘s his way of saying ‚Thank you‘ to his closest (oil exporting) allies who in turn help him out with $$$?
6333 2018-05-20 17:23:47 Installing long rage grappling hooks? Unless he’s actually advocating the murder of gun owners
6334 2018-05-20 17:23:46 Yes, but whose money given to oil companies , boss its  public money

6337 2018-05-20 17:23:12 I'm certain even you don't believe what you're saying.  Fracking existed but was non-existent during booming 80s & 90s when oil was as low as $12/bbl.  U.S. energy industry was almost non-existent, yet oil was less than 1/5th of what it is today. OPEC nations struggled too. #USD
6338 2018-05-20 17:23:04 Oil is another way to make money.. we know and we can see empty seats  on tv
6339 2018-05-20 17:23:04 No such thing as clean coal. Miners are are among the most at risk workers in the country. We need coal about as much as we need whale oil for energy.
6340 2018-05-20 17:23:02 Oils that help your eyebrows get thick:
- Castor oil 

- Jojoba oil

- Vitamin e oil

- Coconut oil

6344 2018-05-20 17:22:34 Wall Street on Oil, 2014-2018

$120: it's going to $200
$90: back up the truck
$60: real value at the margin
$30: don't catch a falling knife
6345 2018-05-20 17:22:24 They'd already poured oil on d tyre and told the driver one story like that. My sister was fasting then and her spirit just wasn't right with it. That was how they told us that to repair the car we'd pay #800 and we agreed. Infront of this hurt along the road.
6346 2018-05-20 17:22:24 Agree to disagree brother. I would if I could. Semper Fi.
6347 2018-05-20 17:22:21 If you would just push to legalize medical marijuana at the federal level and allow the use of CBD oil as a treatment for children in hospitals across the country, then you would become a hero to countless families that currently despise you for allowing Sessions to block it.
6348 2018-05-20 17:22:21 i’ve needed an oil change for a good month and a half and have yet to get one

6353 2018-05-20 17:21:30 I take 3-5 Fish Oil Caps from @Team_Optimum. Those are (imho) the best on the market.
6354 2018-05-20 17:21:18 Blame Venezuela, the country with the largest reserves in the world can't figure out how to pump oil. Yay full tilt socialism. Speaking of, they have an election today that is so rigged, even Chicago is embarrassed.
6355 2018-05-20 17:21:15 Bloody EVERYONE uses palm oil. It makes me so angry
6356 2018-05-20 17:21:15 Oil is the most traded commodity in the world so it is not likely that wholesale prices will diverge much. 

On the other hand, maybe gasoline in Ontario would be cheaper if Energy East was built so Ontario could be supplied from Canadian sources.  :-)

Stealing resources of other countries 
Israel is killing palestinians,  Why US is blind on that,  
Are u all hypocrite?
6359 2018-05-20 17:21:12 It’s okay sister. I have some ideas of the 1000 yr reign, but our job isn’t to be troubled about this, but to keep the oil of the Holy Ghost filled up in our lives and be ready now for the returning our Lord.

6373 2018-05-20 17:19:37 Actually the US exports oil now.
6374 2018-05-20 17:19:35 If that's all he's achieving on juice, he's eating dirty AF, not pushing himself, & he's got ½ peanut oil going on his ass.
6375 2018-05-20 17:19:29 Heat - front and back if necessary. Some kind of painkiller if you've got some - anything to take the edge off. I used to find smelling ylang ylang oil helped - just on a tissue / diffuser.
6376 2018-05-20 17:19:24 Scandinavian socialism is not all it’s cracked up to be. I have family in Oslo that live happy lives but the reasons they are able to run a government based on socialist practices would not work here. They are a small country with giant oil reserves so their brand of socialism...
6377 2018-05-20 17:19:02 He sounds #ignorant and also like he owns stock in oil companies.
6378 2018-05-20 17:18:54 LIAR.  You didn't listen to local voices.  You sold out to big oil that pollute Utah land.  Utahans deserve better than you.  Your nothing more than a Trump lackey.
6379 2018-05-20 17:18:47 Crude oil at 80 dollar/ barrel may be 100 dollar govt. Is not responsible for this..

6381 2018-05-20 17:18:43 Interesting presentation by Dr. Christine Williams at the #aapg2018 Prowress networking reception looking at women in the oil and gas industry noting a leaky pipeline for women geoscientists in the field and a reduction in diversity following recent cutbacks. We must do better!

6390 2018-05-20 17:17:59 Use your wealth & power to improve people's lives. Don't advocate 20th century solutions to 21st century problems & promote corruption & bribing politicians; something the @bcndp & @BCGreens have worked so hard to get $ out of politics. Reveals M.O. of oil industry #sadface

6392 2018-05-20 17:17:40 I stand corrected the suits are water access and aquifer control to stop or slow draws for oil extraction. Water quality claims are filed in BC by Alberta tar sands adjacent bands
6393 2018-05-20 17:17:39 Every time a republican is in office oil is high meaning gas is high. I work in the oil field at a refinery and right now our 1 site is making $4,000,000 in profit per day! I dont think its a coincidence

6399 2018-05-20 17:17:06 Well, they have to push the narrative that the US is filled with toxic masculinity. 
6400 2018-05-20 17:16:58 What price would be justified? Rs 8.40 per litre despite global crude oil hitting 80 dollars?  Instead of reducing consumption, we are cribbing!

He propped the country up on oil money while silencing his opposition through force and once he died, it all fell flat on its face.
6415 2018-05-20 17:15:52 If you have an oil fired central heating system, it is a bad thing to let the tank runs dry. This will result in no heating and no hot water 
 You then spend hours reading manuals and watching videos on bleeding the oil pump so you can fix it 
6416 2018-05-20 17:15:39 Oil King doesn't give a fuck about Rashid nerfs.
6417 2018-05-20 17:15:30 You buy the oil and then they just change it? Or they use their own oil?

6422 2018-05-20 17:15:03 I use a whole head of garlic, peeled, a lemon and a half, about 1/8 tsp salt, say a cup of oil. Net of sweet potatoes. Cook your tubers roastvor microwave with a bit of water), put all other ingredients into food processor plus enough tuber to get it blending.
6423 2018-05-20 17:15:02 i use coconut oil religiously
6424 2018-05-20 17:15:02 They can say what they want. They pulled the same shit with Tambo when Lowe was clearly still calling the shots (remember Oil Change lol ) the OEG are masters at deflecting criticism for their decisions.
6425 2018-05-20 17:14:57 I dont really see the resemblance, but I've been confused for Oil King both on stream and in real life. Just realized how flattering that is, the man is mad stylish
6426 2018-05-20 17:14:56 Sources say that evangelical extremists began drilling for oil in several uninsured Americans, but you were too distracted by Trump's tweets to notice.
6427 2018-05-20 17:14:55 It was low bcos at that time UPA govt subsidised oil price creating a dent in coffers of Govt and we had to pay for it indirectly. This Govt rationalised it and not giving subsidy..so please compare objectively. Do u want subisdised fuel or pay the rationalised price linked
6428 2018-05-20 17:14:54 Open borders with a welfare system,it's pretty simple tonwork out £39 out of every £60 we put in our tank is tax (greedy oil barons get £1.73) not to mention having to work extra years to retirement,imagine on a building site at 67,this is disgusting!

6432 2018-05-20 17:14:36 A Canadian school bus driver (Transporting Young Human Souls) making $17,000 (Below Poverty Level) after being taxed at that same 30% tax bracket as an Oil & Gas worker (Destroying The Environment) making "Good Money" $250,000. How (In your in your mind) is that fair or balanced.
6433 2018-05-20 17:14:35 The United States of America has been itching to get it hands on the oil in Venezuela for the longest of time. The commodity is the cause of many instabilities in the Middle East due to the imperialists insatiable lust for natural resources that belong to the indigenous people.
6434 2018-05-20 17:14:29 Chris Stewart didn't protect Utah land.  He sold out to Trump/Zinke to take away land protections so oil leases could be sold to big oil.  He screwed Utahans that voted for him who wanted our Natl Parks protected.
6435 2018-05-20 17:14:26 Absolutely and we must not let the Old Snake Oil Salesman do it again. Bernie is as jealous of President Obama as The Shitholer is. He was never comfortable with a Black Man sitting behind the Big Desk in the Oval Office.

6444 2018-05-20 17:13:43 I mean, it’s science. Speaking of, should I assume you don’t believe in climate change as well? I mean, I’m holding out hope for some semblance of a redeeming quality in you. Douglass. Please, tell me you don’t support the oil and gas industry over your grandkids. Please? Doug?

6447 2018-05-20 17:13:01 And how much you pay for an oil change?
6448 2018-05-20 17:13:00 Katy should try bulletproof coffee: 1Tbl MCT oil, 1Tbl butter stevia to taste, blend it w/an egg frother til thoroughly mixed. Just like a latte!
6449 2018-05-20 17:12:53 JKL Dolphins vs City Oil now
6450 2018-05-20 17:12:47 I only learned that when I dated an Italian in my younger days. He was so horrified that I "wasted good oil" by cooking with it.
6451 2018-05-20 17:12:43 @fayedsouza The truth is , price of oil has gone up all over the world! I can give you quotes/proof ,
6452 2018-05-20 17:12:31 @realFemiOtedola been a tiny part of forte oil has always been the dream of most of us here.but the problem is that, DREAMS in Nigeria take too much time.....India movies.#UNEMPLOYEDNIGERIANyouth

6460 2018-05-20 17:11:55 Congress ने कर कमी केले होते तेव्हा.
2014 ला crude oil 140+ $ p/b(int market) झाले होते तेव्हा पेट्रोल 80 रू लिटर ने मिळत होते.

आणि अत्ता crude oil 80 $ p/b(int market) च्या आसपास आहे तरी पेट्रोल 84 रू लिटर झालंय.

6462 2018-05-20 17:11:39 Is everyone stupid when it comes to @realDonaldTrump ? Soybean producers were screwed, farm equipment profits. Big oil and weapon manufactures are reaping and raping big profits right now.
6463 2018-05-20 17:11:35 Cooking with olive oil is fine as long as you're using it in the right way.
6464 2018-05-20 17:11:30 Most of our oil is imported. If we had opened this up ten years ago, our deficits might look different now.
6465 2018-05-20 17:11:27 Chief motive for coup against Mossadeq was nationalisation of British oil interests.  A very good book on that period is "Patriot of Persia" by Christopher de Bellaigue.  I don't believe CIA was controlling Khomeini.  That is bitterness from the Shah's supporters.
6466 2018-05-20 17:11:15 @thruxtonracing you guys don't by any chance have some 5w30 oil? My friends oil all seems to have escaped his engine in the camp site! Happy to pay!
6467 2018-05-20 17:11:13 @RealOmoSexy does your hair smell like hot oil
6468 2018-05-20 17:11:12 Looks like oil contaminated water
6469 2018-05-20 17:10:48 True story: Canadian Tires are a hodgepodge of useful, but frequently low-quality stuff. A few years ago they figured they should have an online store, but it failed terribly because who wants to buy motor oil and a cheap patio set online?
6470 2018-05-20 17:10:36 Higher oil prices also help, ..., wait for it,...,  RUSSIA!  Coincidence?
6471 2018-05-20 17:10:35 And guess who the rising price of oil benefits?

6473 2018-05-20 17:10:22 There is just something a bit more appealing seeing an oil burner.

6477 2018-05-20 17:09:49 Why can't AMSOIL just sell their shit at Advance or Auto Zone? Nooooooooo they gotta sell it like a fucking pyramid scheme. I get that 40 years ago they needed to educate people why synthetic oil was better, but now basically every car REQUIRES it. Fuck your MLM bullshit.
6478 2018-05-20 17:09:48 How? How is it worse than using their deaths to further an agenda rather than making real change and addressing the real issue? And not every victim or family agrees with the idea that weapons are a problem. Plus you calling it a "toy" shows how little you understand.
6479 2018-05-20 17:09:40 Respected @narendramodi Indian fuel prices are highest in the world. If other oil importing countries can sell cheaper fuel, why India can’t? This can’t be #AchheDin model, except for oil companies.

6482 2018-05-20 17:09:13 Don’t cook with olive oil, ever. It’s not for that.

6484 2018-05-20 17:09:11 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
6485 2018-05-20 17:09:08 Retweeted Ed Krassenstein (@EdKrassen):

Look the other way.... Saudi Arabia just help Trump win the election in exchange for him doubling the price of of their main export (oil), by bailing out of a U.N. deal with Iran, but no, that's not TREASON.

6487 2018-05-20 17:08:51 What about when crude oil prices were low. Did you reduce the prices? Don't fool people. Production by OPEC is low because that is how they control the prices.
6488 2018-05-20 17:08:36 I washed my face last night with a cleanser for oily skin and I woke up dripping oil wth!
6489 2018-05-20 17:08:29 Yes. I recommend cloves of garlic. Holy Anointing Oil flasks (burns twice as much as holy water) and ditch the high heels, you can't run in them. Remember kids the 10 foot pole can be used to vault out of the grave yard. Now, don't you wish you had take that pole? Fuck yah you do
6490 2018-05-20 17:08:25 If @lngcanada can donate a schoolbus and many other community things why can those companies who need kinder Morgan donate oil clean up ships and tugs ? Show some good faith ?

6496 2018-05-20 17:07:46 The country America was built on help then demonized for the profits of oil.. the war on drugs ushered in. By Nixon
6497 2018-05-20 17:07:44 What has irritated me recently is a bunch of celeb chefs saying to use olive oil for cooking a steak, but I *know* that’s wrong ugh
6498 2018-05-20 17:07:44 IT IS EASY AND CHEAP: sunflower oil or butter will serve for almost every cooking need.

Olive oil is for dressing and dipping, unless you’re a monster.
6499 2018-05-20 17:07:38 I’ve heard this said previously, and indeed have even been chided for owning no “cooking oil,” but was skeptical of the rationale.   cc:   @nataliesurely
6500 2018-05-20 17:07:36 Within that murky oil lurks the devil himself Reverend. You have now allowed him access to your nasal catacombs. May I suggest you blow your nose immediately?
6501 2018-05-20 17:07:29 Crude oil prices are rising. I'm not sure this is a good thing for Nigeria. What it means is that Government will pay more on subsidy or "under recovery". We could have fuel scarcity in future, due to a mismatch in claims.

Note I said "could", not "will".
6502 2018-05-20 17:07:28 Let me take a shower, slather myself in coconut oil, get into a onesie, pour a dlazof of red and watch Paris Is Burning 
6503 2018-05-20 17:07:24 truth. Also, I only like my own wedges, sliced from russet potatoes, lightly tossed with grapeseed oil baked in the oven. Protip: add some freshly squeezed lemon juice drops while baking.

6507 2018-05-20 17:07:02 Yea that’s is true. Dirt and oil does in fact help the hair grow. It’s just different cases that I’m so against when women CHOOSE not to take care of their hair

6510 2018-05-20 17:06:49 That sounds like more nonsense, respectfully Gary. It’s the same with the forest  fires that are hot on the tail of this year’s flood season. But it’s great to know that the beliefs of Pro Oil supporters like you is based on the nonsense spread by the @FriendsOScience !
6511 2018-05-20 17:06:46 I wish more people knew this. I use ghee, coconut oil, sunflower oil, or vegetable oil (depending on need). Olive oil is for eating raw.
6512 2018-05-20 17:06:43 Interesting isn't it that one of trump's first moves was reducing strategic oil reserves?
6513 2018-05-20 17:06:42 See the change in crude oil price.  Naseebwale ka naseeb kharab ho gaya.
6514 2018-05-20 17:06:26 Washes are really easy to do. Great way to make something look oily, or dirty, is with a Games Workshop Nuln Oil, or Agrax Earthshade wash. Lots of others like those in other paint lines too.

6545 2018-05-20 17:02:24 Fortunately @realDonaldTrump @POTUS knows how dire the situation in #Venezuela is. Trump has taken very strong action against the @NicolasMaduro regime and will take even stronger once this sham election is over. Perhaps cut off oil, or perhaps military intervention...

6578 2018-05-20 16:59:16 @PhaedrusAnimus  Have you seen this incredible thread?  Intensely complex spider web here - on just one oil field.  Merely one head of a hydra, most likely.  Trump is up against quite a Leviathan himself.  Much credit to @CarrollQuigley1 for putting this thread together.
6579 2018-05-20 16:59:13 Aquaria is my favourite too....she’s done some really stunning looks. The oil slick mermaid was beautiful 
6580 2018-05-20 16:59:04 Ohhhh, I thought it was like oil or something  my bad
6581 2018-05-20 16:58:55 I gotta put on oil on these braids
6582 2018-05-20 16:58:43 Remember when Turkey was caught providing ISIS with oil? They are terrorist sympathizers.
6583 2018-05-20 16:58:41 Nope Stew; EV was a single hull VLCC. Today those ships don’t exist anymore. There have been Zero tanker spills since the 90’s. The crew requirements have changed too. You’re not informed enough on the minutiae of oil/chemical transport. You’re just looking foolish
6584 2018-05-20 16:58:39 Looking forward to attending the MIT CIO Symposium @mitcio ... Technology innovation is a cornerstone in the oil & gas industry #innovation #oilandgas
6585 2018-05-20 16:58:31 What abt 122% hike in excise duty on crude oil? Why you are looting common people?

Rest of the world are doing their job for #CleanEnergy #Innovation4Climate
6588 2018-05-20 16:58:05 I've heard a lot of good things about that oil. I'ma look into it 
6589 2018-05-20 16:57:57 Up 70 cents in my area. 15 gal = $38.85 and I live in a state known for its oil production.
6590 2018-05-20 16:57:49 I love my chips like this I use sunflower oil for deep frying, chips with ketchup & barbecue sauce from the table top bottle is my weaknessaggggh I wanna make some now

6592 2018-05-20 16:57:33 Too much.  Minimal and elegant is the thing. Plus oil for arms and décolleté
6593 2018-05-20 16:57:32 The guidelines that nobody followed. Seems like a stretch. Cattle evolved to eat grass 100kcal/lb not grain. Humans evolved to eat tubers and meat just as calorie dense as grains. Added oil and sugar  calorie density/palatability last 100years
6594 2018-05-20 16:57:28 How much are trumpinoff, putin and the arabs profiting from higher oil prices due to withdrawal from the iran deal.
6595 2018-05-20 16:57:26 From Business Insider, May 14, 2018:  RUSSIA'S OIL REVENUE IS ABOUT TO SOAR
6596 2018-05-20 16:57:26 If that oil came from any other province, not named Alberta - there would be celebrations in the street.

6598 2018-05-20 16:57:20 Thank you everyone who continues to donate to our collection for @GCMcare foodbank.  City Mission have advised that they would particularly appreciate sugar, tea, coffee, cordial, cereals, tinned tomatoes and pulses, tinned goods, pasta, cooking oil and gift cards.
6599 2018-05-20 16:57:07 South Indian foods use very less oil..
6600 2018-05-20 16:56:37 Get essential oils- Lavender, Lemon, and peppermint. You could diffuse them or mix them with a carrier oil and rub it on your temples, behind your ears, and the back of your neck.
6601 2018-05-20 16:56:21 mane out here doing normal oil changes every 3k. i’m finna hitup craigslist or t.i.t.s now cause your shit nostalgic.

6609 2018-05-20 16:55:56 @waitrose we buy your essential Waitrose French fries. Ingredients include palm oil. Can you tell me if it is from a sustainable source? As production of this typically involves destroying rainforests. Thank you in advance. 
6610 2018-05-20 16:55:55 I didn't say Canada imports US oil, Canada imports oil from middle east mostly. I was suggesting that US has CANADA were they want it, land locked and unable to export its oil at full market price practically forcing Canada to sell to US at discount
6611 2018-05-20 16:55:29 Reading right off the sous vide machine today: Salmon setting 46.1C for 45 min :) we then drained of of its cooking juices and crisped skin side down with a bit of butter and olive oil in hot pan
6612 2018-05-20 16:55:17 I take it the 'true state' is whatever you believe? Oil is not the unique driver and contributor to national wealth, there are many drivers of national wealth, including a strong public sector. Oil will be used but the boom is over. Hope you didn't plan your life around it.
6613 2018-05-20 16:54:49 I certainly wouldn't say no  maybe use some oil aswell 
6614 2018-05-20 16:54:42 Trump and his DEAL with ISRAEL DESTABILIZED the MIDDLE EAST and it AFFECTED OIL DISTRIBUTION to the USA.
6615 2018-05-20 16:54:34 Oil. This is the last money grab for dying industry.

6618 2018-05-20 16:54:11 It wasn't oil that made them selfish, its their (our) mentality. If we were still into agriculture,  same thing would have happened. You don't change a man by changing his business, you change a man by changing his mindset. There is a we think and reason that keeps us in bondage
6619 2018-05-20 16:54:05 Measure four pinches of olive oil and set timer for 3 minutes.

6621 2018-05-20 16:53:54 its rotary right? people been hyping the oil consumption theory for the longest.
6622 2018-05-20 16:53:53 need my oil changed
6623 2018-05-20 16:53:44 To put it another way, Oil still have an excellent set of 4C (97, LD, Strome, JJ) AND as good a wing you can possibly imagine for 97, without any new moves.  Impossible if Ebs here v. Strome.
6624 2018-05-20 16:53:44   Have the #TeamSaladCream trio had their cod liver oil today I wonder? #TeamMayo
6625 2018-05-20 16:53:39 そうする。
6626 2018-05-20 16:53:27 Not true. A rumoured deal was presented as LD and Nurse for OEL.  His answer was “Yes” if OEL was signed for 8 years.  There’s no other way to interpret this. I’m a big fan of acquiring OEL but that’s a steep price to pay. Either he’s overvaluing OEL or undervaluing LD / Nurse.

6630 2018-05-20 16:53:07 Azerbaijan could be a really cool place if they weren’t paralyzed by corruption. Baku is beautiful, there’s beaches! And there’s this  crude oil bath they do that heals psoriasis... I really want to go for that alone.
6631 2018-05-20 16:52:53 A little bit highlighter on your cheekbone can change your makeup game. And for that, you have to invest in high-end makeup products. Here is a quick tip, Just sweep a small amount of coconut oil on top of your makeup and leave it. #coconutoil #Tips #trick #makeup #blogger
6632 2018-05-20 16:52:28 Genie oil.....whose on the board? 
6633 2018-05-20 16:51:52 As a dad & granddad I hope you'll come to learn the importance of reducing reliance on fossil fuels to preserve planet for your heirs. As a biz columnist, a COMBINED group of industries CAN replace oil, incl. tech, which is actually multiple industries under one banner.
6634 2018-05-20 16:51:27 No til oil and ghee.. when we make north indian food use mustard oil..
6635 2018-05-20 16:51:24 I knew SO MANY people who just gave themselves over to “movement” (cult) after movement. Just willing to believe the latest snake oil salesmen selling enlightenment
6636 2018-05-20 16:51:21 Special thanks to Kendric at Lafayette’s @Take5_OilChange. Was honest in pointing out that our oil wasn’t ready to be changed.  #CustomerService

6639 2018-05-20 16:50:47 #PROTIP a lot of people with oily skin think they don’t need to moisturize, but your skin is actually over-producing oil to compensate for your skins dryness and lack of moisture. everyone needs to moisturize bitches!!! (and don’t forget sunscreen)
6640 2018-05-20 16:50:40 maaaan i hate when people ask this question. they don't suck down oil like it's gas lol. i change it every 3k miles and i never have to top it off inbetween. it only has 95k miles. had 76k when i got it.
6641 2018-05-20 16:50:35 Now I remember why I put oils into freshly detangled hair. I was covered in conditioner and confused...

I drip dry my hair with the aid of a fan. Castor oil acts as a light gel, so your hair stops dripping earlier. Just don't put it on shampooed hair before other oils. Trust me.
6642 2018-05-20 16:50:29 Bull from oil companies! Only person you are trying to convince is you
6643 2018-05-20 16:50:26 oil through the AC yeah yeah
6644 2018-05-20 16:50:26 That doesn't make sense. From what I read, we are planning to double our oil imports from Iran in 2018-19 fiscal. We may buy from US too. But no way we are going to stop importing from ME.
6645 2018-05-20 16:50:26 Tbh if I sweat, I sweat. But imma smell like coconut oil and vanilla regardless
6646 2018-05-20 16:50:23 I need coconut oil
6647 2018-05-20 16:50:21 The Oil Company employees are paid much more compared to other PSU's. Cost cutting can be reviewed...

6649 2018-05-20 16:49:45 Yes, I really like the look of the oil stuff Glen uses. I spoke to two guys and one lady. I was actually praising the company as a whole for being a bit reticent regarding social media  and being more like engineers who make the heart of a complex system.
6650 2018-05-20 16:49:42 These 2 products are working wonders on troubled skin!  Who would’ve thought an “oil” cleanser and “balancing bacteria” would have these results!
6651 2018-05-20 16:49:42 I think if you read that carefully you'll see it says it's not about oil.
6652 2018-05-20 16:49:39 Cost efficiency please. Oil Company people are over salaried at our cost.
6653 2018-05-20 16:49:37 Perhaps the Saudis want to see $80.00 + oil?
6654 2018-05-20 16:49:04 May Jesus help B.C. resist+defeat Texas oil and the rape of our province.

6669 2018-05-20 16:46:49 Guys wait for MP Raj and Cgarh election suddenly Mr PM will remember aam admi and cut excise duty, freeze oil rate. Then 2019 elections will he will use the same money to waive of farmer loans and get elected back Next 4.5 yrs same status. Save this tweet if you want to remember.
6670 2018-05-20 16:46:27 I agree wholeheartedly. Never understood claims that the incentives support big climatology, not big oil; it's motivated reasoning. But of course oil is going to be a massive part of our future, and renewables will be small until the economics line up. Hope they get cheap enough
6671 2018-05-20 16:46:27 5% of Turkana's oil revenue to the locals is simply an insult to a people marginalized for the whole history of this state called Kenya, its an invitation to chaos. Why should the national govt get 75% of the revenues! If don't get it right, it shall be a curse, this oil!

6675 2018-05-20 16:45:58 I believe if Nigeria hadn't discovered crude oil in the late fifties & had continued on the pedestal of agriculture & Agro-allied industrialization, we would've been better off than we presently are. Crude oil in Nigeria encouraged mentally/physically lazy leadership & elite.
6676 2018-05-20 16:45:51 the oil industry isn't down the swanny, yes there have been a lot of cut backs but price is rising every week, now sitting over $80 a barrel if it continues this way investment will rise more exploration jobs will follow white paper is not just about oil we have more than oil
6677 2018-05-20 16:45:40 Where's my oil?

6681 2018-05-20 16:45:27 Brent $84 per barrel. That is 198 liters
We are paying Rs.84/- per liter. Whatever the transport, process charges, in transit loss, taxes, and profits that is still pretty high. Actually double. Wonder how MMS maintained it at under 70 when Brent oil was $120?
6682 2018-05-20 16:45:19 Darcy never suggested the deal but rather if it was fair from a value standpoint and he's not wrong. 8 yrs of a No. 1 D is going to cost you in a deal. No question Leon has a high ceiling but it depends on what you think Nurse's ceiling is? For me it's a 2nd pairing guy.

6714 2018-05-18 23:56:39 Basically he is talking shot to pander to InCels who are desperate and stupid enough to buy his snake oil books
6715 2018-05-18 23:56:17 I am not offended by your support for Rothschilds Zionist state of Israel,but very disappointed,your taking the trump train over the cliff,especially if it means war to defend Israel+it's oil interests in Golan Heights(Genie Energy)maybe you heard?
6716 2018-05-18 23:56:07 When gas prices hit $3.00 a gallon, you know there's a republican in the Whitehouse. I'd rather pay taxes to feed and educate children and care for the elderly than give my money to a pig run oil company.
6717 2018-05-18 23:56:02 Frank Holmes (1874 – January 1947), known affectionately by Arabs as "Abu Naft" (the Father of Oil), was a British-New Zealander mining engineer, geologist and oil concession hunter.
6718 2018-05-18 23:55:34 Tourists don’t come to the beach to look at oil platforms while dead fish wash up on the shore. If tourism is our industry, we have to remain aesthetically pleasing so people will come here. This isn’t a dem or repub issue. At all.
6719 2018-05-18 23:55:27 @ajajanea Yeesh! Have you taken care of the oil change?
6720 2018-05-18 23:55:05 The emissions from coal, "natural" gas, & oil are not clean. There needs to be a balance between profit & Clean Air & Clean Drinking Water. With the increase in air pollution &  contamination of drinking water in America we are on a fast track to problems of a third world country
6721 2018-05-18 23:54:53 Please @potus produce & export more oil. Gas prices are SKYROCKETING again in our country.
6722 2018-05-18 23:54:41 Took my car in for an oil change and tire rotation and I walked out paying $0 
6723 2018-05-18 23:54:32 His beautiful clean coal is the difference between survival and destruction for billions. The war to stop consumption of crude oil is fairly hopeless, but the line has to be drawn at coal, or we're done.
6724 2018-05-18 23:54:23 This happened when the city seemed about to fall”.[4] In addition to this, Germany’s shortage of oil supplies hindered their ability to produce aircraft, automobiles, and engines. The allies took advantage of this by producing thousands of vehicles to aid their war effort.
6725 2018-05-18 23:54:22 おめでとう！
6726 2018-05-18 23:54:17 The demand for oil during World War I. It became obvious that oil was going to be a crucial resource in warfare for the foreseeable future.[2] Examples that proved this were “General Gallieni’s commandeering of the Paris taxi fleet to ferry soldiers to the front.
6727 2018-05-18 23:54:02 How low can Labour go in this budget? Less in Health than National? Ardern cares so much for kids but failed to bother to meet with Charter Schools -parents-teachers or Farmers and families or Oil and Gas families or Taranaki ? Just another photo shoot in another school #tokenPM
6728 2018-05-18 23:53:20 I agree, my parents were old school, my dad was born during WW1, depression, WW2, things that shaped great character for survival. Their biggest concern was food and shelter at times.
6729 2018-05-18 23:53:17 Adik aku dah beli baju raya, warna navy blue. Dia cakap,

6732 2018-05-18 23:52:50 Leaving the lousy Iran deal has no impact on oil prices. Saudis are short sided. High oil prices will encourage USA production.
6733 2018-05-18 23:52:41 Idiot references from he who is most qualified to speak them. Swamp master con artist trump .. into oil money much .. simply garbage Still!
6734 2018-05-18 23:52:41 I like how my boys smoking his cigarettes next to the rig. Nah bro it's cool, I mean it's not like we're hauling 7,500 gallons of flammable oil. Go for it light another one ⛟
6735 2018-05-18 23:52:40 after washing your hair when it’s wet split it into sections and try using sheamoisture curl enhancing smoothie with the argan oil ecostyler gel with a little bit of coconut oil on the ends
6736 2018-05-18 23:52:24 Oil energy walla bta3 de!
6737 2018-05-18 23:52:22 My FIL had a lot of pain and difficulty sleeping, and the CBD oil seemed to help him quite a bit. There are studies I've read that indicate it legitimately helps.
6738 2018-05-18 23:52:20 But the candidate the democrat party is pushing for governor this year does not support universal Healthcare or halting the oil pipeline underneath our great lakes which most would consider protecting the planet... Maybe everyone didn't get the memo?
6739 2018-05-18 23:52:07 Mr Trump why not release some of America’s Strategic Oil Supplies and increase available oil supplies and bring down these crippling gas prices. If something doesn’t happen soon everyone’s tax cuts will be going to buy gas. How will America grow economically without pocket money?
6740 2018-05-18 23:52:02 You're a total Moron, clean green energy is the future & future jobs  , you're backwards thinking & holding up Progress ! Burning oil , coal , gas is ruining the environment .
6741 2018-05-18 23:52:00 I'm 99% of the way to perfecting the chocolate recipe.
Right now it's:
1/4 cup coconut oil (melted)
1/4 cup cocoa powder
2 tablespoons agave oil

I don't have enough cocoa left to try again but I THINK the perfect chocolate bar is gonna be:
1Tblsp agave oil + 1Tblsp honey
6742 2018-05-18 23:51:52 Believe me, it doesn’t. The only thing to make it cleaner is if the businesses that burn it buy some type of contraption. It’s really expensive so they never have. Now oil and gas are cleaner and cheaper. Coal will be gone soon. WV needs to let something else come in now, soon.

6744 2018-05-18 23:51:34 thats generally the rule i follow except for oil because i heard the cream would become ineffective :<
6745 2018-05-18 23:51:31 that is a completely false statement. the vast majority of our oil is still imported from the middle east.
6746 2018-05-18 23:51:28 The full sentence: "The country east of Poland is a kleptocracy that would be as poor as Ukraine if it weren't for its 10 million barrels per day of oil production." Belarus produces 10 mil barrels per day? U'r the 1 "marginally" bordering... illiteracy.
6747 2018-05-18 23:51:17 You are promoting natural gas and oil from Russia. Admit it.
6748 2018-05-18 23:51:11 Because of they have no oil, gas.. Because of western media work for big corperations and their aim.
6749 2018-05-18 23:51:09 because there are no gas or oil reserves for western nations to take advantage from
6750 2018-05-18 23:50:57 Oh yea we’re the bad ones, the community, not the big oil or banking industries literally DESTROYING the planet
6751 2018-05-18 23:50:29 When are Americans going to benefit from all this clean coal? Used to be Electric companies had coal back up systems,, then oil, now it's gas. With all this shale America has, when will Americans see their gas prices go down?
I predict never because it's all about making money.
6752 2018-05-18 23:49:54 Nuclear energy is cleaner and more environmental and ecologically friendly than coal, natural gas, oil, etc.
6753 2018-05-18 23:49:26 High school athletes forget about loyalty, honor and integrity under the new open transfer rules in Florida.  What happened to being the leader to build a team around? What is wrong with parents that take their kid away from a quality education for the snake oil?

6761 2018-05-18 23:48:54 Coconut oil!! It’s honestly a life saver x
6762 2018-05-18 23:48:50 The US is like a lion that sees an injured antelope. Venezuela doesn't have a diversified economy and that dependence on oil left it vulnerable. The US is currently exploiting that vulnerability through sanctions and covert actions. The US should be providing aid!
6763 2018-05-18 23:48:50 i thought moisturizers were before oils in skincare? oil seeps through them but not vice versa, but moisturizing creams lock in everything... so what is the truth?
6764 2018-05-18 23:48:47 @columbiatribune Perhaps you should start exercising some journalistic integrity over your publication, including John Darkow. US hasn't bought oil from Iran in a quarter century. Journalism today doesn't deserve constitutional protection. #FakeNews
6765 2018-05-18 23:48:40 Announcement...... The refinary in Vancouver is low on oil , they will be bringing EXTRA oil tankers in to the harbour so they have enough.

6769 2018-05-18 23:48:10 Preheat an oven to about 400 degrees. While that heats up slide up a potato as seen above. In a bowl make your seasoning mix with a few tablespoons of vegetable oil, garlic salt, paprika, pepper, and some chili pepper for a bit of extra kick...
6770 2018-05-18 23:48:09 Wow just dropped my new bottle of baby oil and it all spilled out 
6771 2018-05-18 23:48:07 Thanks for standing up and forcing these two to look at this.they have other agendas.oil.amongst other things.they want to ban BDS. silence their voices.who is spewing the hate here.Shumer & Gillibrand are.both sides have to peacefully find a,solution
6772 2018-05-18 23:48:00 How to sell out the big oil? She is in bettering our economy. Oil and gas is part of Alberta. The Alberta Government has invested in multiple new programs, to help diversify our economy. That's not selling out that's in investing.
6773 2018-05-18 23:47:57 Godfather: Part II? No, that was Olive Oil.
6774 2018-05-18 23:47:56 / I used coconut shampoo and all that for a little while. I just didn’t know if people legitimately used it for oil consistently.
6775 2018-05-18 23:47:56 Yeah, the doctor said it was an infected oil gland, so antibiotics should help. She said my pee will stink, though. XD

6780 2018-05-18 23:46:25 Why don't the international election monitors report this tampering? The Colombian government has completely sold out to the US. Any Colombia involvement is orchestrated by the CIA. The biggest problem was the fall in world oil prices due to fracking and the recession.

6784 2018-05-18 23:46:01 This was the one of the biggest fears of the neocons during the GW Bush administration, b/c KSA has the largest supply of, & highest quality, oil in the world. Given how unstable the region is now, a coup, here, could be catastrophic.

6786 2018-05-18 23:45:44 True....Germany et al are, as we know, at mercy of oil/gas suppliers. We finally started exporting oil again since the legal prohibition from 1970s. We’ve learned to liquify and transport natural gas LNG..but there aren’t enough tankers manufactured. And it’ll never be enough.

6807 2018-05-18 23:43:33 Tighter budgets, big jump in gas prices from oil embargo, ready availability of cheaper imports.
6808 2018-05-18 23:43:29 The real threat to the United States is the United States for following Israel and Saudi Arabia and everything that they tell us we unilaterally follow their orders one backs are petrodollar with oil and the other  controll  are Christian  viewership

6816 2018-05-18 23:42:11 Fed hiking rates. Bond yields popping. Oil prices soaring. Increasing wage gap. Inverting Yield Curve.  #Recession or #Stagflation is near.
6817 2018-05-18 23:42:08 1 They get paid for services
2 The oil companies get billions every year in taxpayer handouts, the most profitable companies in the world, have you ever asked that question about them? 
6818 2018-05-18 23:42:08 ‘Shoot, if it keeps going like this they’re going to be buying from us!’

No, seen as they have shit loads of oil and can gauge the prices for it, no, they won’t be.
6819 2018-05-18 23:42:03 @kelseyybaileyyy you're a bad (good) influence cuz I just splurged and got Sunday Riley's clay cleanser. I was about to get the Good Genes and Luna Oil combo but out of my budget right now.

6822 2018-05-18 23:41:48 I often have similar sensations on various parts of body e.g. feeling as if hot oil running over skin; cold 'wet' patches; etc. My most common (constant!) one is 'burning' - started in feet but gradually expanded area so everything from chest down feels as if being barbecued.

6829 2018-05-18 23:40:25 I also learned the only justification for deep frying. It's faster than baking. I learned to hate the taste of frying oil that sticks with anything that has been deep fried. Working with deep fryers makes you learn to hate deep fried foods.

6833 2018-05-18 23:40:05 It at least in part has to do with Europe and U.S.’s addiction to the “black blood”(oil). Look at the maps where the special interests have been pushing pipelines. It’s all areas that have opposed pipelines to go through to Europe (Turkey, Syria, etc.)

Don't @ me
6840 2018-05-18 23:38:58 Okay I admit it- I’m obsessed with coconut oil.

6844 2018-05-18 23:38:33 1) The US Oil boom started under Obama, not Trump.
2) USA has been exporting oil for over a century.

6845 2018-05-18 23:38:25 Because there's a lot of money tied up in oil.
6846 2018-05-18 23:38:17 Arabs can make the world stop if they wanted. Just stop selling oil & see how everyone falls into line. But no, the $$$$$$ is sooo addictive!
6847 2018-05-18 23:38:09 マジシングルアプリ落ちうざいねんけど
6848 2018-05-18 23:37:46 Er...what like the CIA investing in social media through it's investment arm In-Q-Tel?

The media arm of the capitalist industrial complex enables the corrupt & damaging arms/banking/oil industries to continue (eg by creating desire for products or propaganda).
6849 2018-05-18 23:37:38 It's an oil lamp. :)
6850 2018-05-18 23:37:35 BTW @cenkuygur peak oil is defined as oil production reaching maximum production and going into terminal decline.  The amount of oil is not really a factor for peak oil. #TYTLive
6851 2018-05-18 23:37:20 We still get 33% of our oil from OPEC. Google's your friend.
6852 2018-05-18 23:37:16 #tytlive Genius Foods Book looks interesting but why would you go on that snake oil sale man's show Dr. Oz or allow him to appear anywhere on your book? Sorry but it reduces it credibility. Apologies for my as @AnaKasparian would say "salty" mood today.
6853 2018-05-18 23:37:13 What's wrong with selling snake oil if people are willing to buy it?
6854 2018-05-18 23:37:12 Yer I make a lot of my own meals from scratch. I once made a curry with too much mustard seed oil & garlic. In spite of maintaining impeccable hygiene. I reeked of garlic for 2 days. My friends bombarded me with vampire related jokes. (That's how & why I know the reason). 
6855 2018-05-18 23:37:06 Devolveme la campera Motor Oil !!!!
6856 2018-05-18 23:36:58 So you think presidents control the stock market but has no impact on the price of oil?
6857 2018-05-18 23:36:56 Gas Rapidly Approaching $3.00 A Gallon. Your Tax Cuts & Bonuses Will All Rapidly Be Frittered Away To Make The Oil & Gas Companies Trillions. What Happened To The Keystone XL Pipeline ?  Gas Should Be Less Than $2.00. Get With It Trump. People Are Suffering.
6858 2018-05-18 23:36:55 You didn't mention how to check the oil! The gas gauge doubles as a oil level gauge.  There's an orange "minimum oil" line in the gauge.
6859 2018-05-18 23:36:52 But what about Unicorn oil? What do you have against clean burning street lamps?
6860 2018-05-18 23:36:36 That Chinese oil company he did trade was a masterpiece. Legend
6861 2018-05-18 23:36:06 this happened under obama.  fracking boom lowered oil price and killed coal
6862 2018-05-18 23:36:06 Darkskin woman have more to offer than just oil covered photoshoots 
6863 2018-05-18 23:36:06 He's not correct mathematically however. Oil still exhibits the best carry characteristics in the liquid commodity complex. There are billions in risk premia strategies buying f3 selling f0 here, or just lifting flat px
6864 2018-05-18 23:36:02 Change your damn oil
6865 2018-05-18 23:35:59 Maybe, in addition to moats, schools need cauldrons of boiling oil on the robes to stop active shooters. #GoingMedievalAgainst SchoolShootings
6866 2018-05-18 23:35:44 I've been looking into buying some cannabis oil for my daughter. And I want to help her but I have no idea where to start. I've never been around any thing like but I was recommended by a friend Stephani to contact Doctor Carine (carinew45@gmail.com) or text (773) 672-4720 
6867 2018-05-18 23:35:44 Yes, I see it around me. My kids are very adult and they have worked very hard for what they have. They got what we could, and what we thought was best, no issues. Never, ever any feet stomping. What will be for the next 20-30 years?
6868 2018-05-18 23:35:38 keep playing to your poorly educated base. by calling it 'clean' coal your drooling idiots think that you actually discovered a safe energy source.
speaking of safe clean energy source, wind and solar.
but I guess they dont stuff your pockets like oil and coal.
6869 2018-05-18 23:35:37 He could you know cut the military budget and use that for the missing healthcare and safety regulations. But no he needs these warships to bomb brown people who sell Oil to the Russians.
6870 2018-05-18 23:35:22 Somebody come oil my scalp, please?  #SoTired
6871 2018-05-18 23:35:17 Now time to coat myself in coconut oil. Soothe my skin.
6872 2018-05-18 23:35:05 Pete. We’ll get bored before the oil runs out.
6873 2018-05-18 23:35:05 No time for helping anyone. Arabs are busy counting their oil money & wondering what color diamond they'll be dressing up their next Lambo
6874 2018-05-18 23:35:03 Oil prices are up 40% in the last 12 months, a direct result of #DotardDonnie's failed diplomacy.
6875 2018-05-18 23:35:00 Oil and water don't mix 
لاتخلط الزيت بالماء 
ياااااسلااااام أسهل واحدة فيهم أقسم بالله 
6876 2018-05-18 23:34:38 I have a whole new attitude towards coconut oil
6877 2018-05-18 23:34:36 Thank you for ending the Clinton/obama cabal stranglehold on U.S. Coal and oil.
6878 2018-05-18 23:34:34 Coal is not clean nor is the process used to get it. Why can't we focus on wind and solar energy? There's an endless supply and harnessing wind and solar energy is much less harmful to our environment than getting coal or oil. It's smart...oh, that's why you won't do it.
6879 2018-05-18 23:34:29 Oil prices are up 40% in the last 12 months, a direct result of your failed diplomacy.
6880 2018-05-18 23:34:17 Coal is not beautiful or clean, oil is not beautiful or clean, nuclear energy is not beautiful or clean, war is not beautiful or clean. You, Donald, are not beautiful or clean.
6881 2018-05-18 23:34:13 How do you think he extracts his oil??
6882 2018-05-18 23:34:07 @nbc are you going to be burning the midnight oil? Or having us wait your idea of payback for so many #renewtimeless tweets? We want #timeless back!
6883 2018-05-18 23:34:04 Oh, Bill, are you still claiming Hilary is going to get locked up? You're quite the 'Snake oil salesman' Got to hand it to you, you really know how to play to the gallery!
6884 2018-05-18 23:34:02 When do oil lamp lit streets make a comeback?
6885 2018-05-18 23:33:54 Whale oil should be making a huge comeback next.......what a baffoon.
6886 2018-05-18 23:33:43 “Under Trump”? If you really believe that our oil situation has anything at all to do with trump, you continue to live in denial
6887 2018-05-18 23:33:35 Whats your take on this gasoline and oil business ? Are we being ripped off ?
6888 2018-05-18 23:33:34 Mine used to do that because the more often you wash it, the more oil your scalp produces. I broke the cycle and only wash it 2-3 times a week now thanks to dry shampoo for in-between days.
6889 2018-05-18 23:33:01 Stop our dependence on foreign oil....They are still controlling oil prices which effects gas prices...Bad time for high gas prices during an election year...Jerk Rhinos care more about.... ILLEGAL Immigrants
6890 2018-05-18 23:32:52 Senile, old, tired, snake oil salesmen, liar, stuttering, slurring, etc politician. But, Californians can't get enough of his type in local and state government.
6891 2018-05-18 23:32:31 Oil prices keep going up. Is that your definition of US dominance?
6892 2018-05-18 23:32:28 It should be: 1 hour labour $140-$165/hour depending on shop. An escape would need approximately 4-5 litres of oil, and you should not pay more than $12-$13 per litre. You would need a need oil filter, which is in the area of $20. $262.50.
6893 2018-05-18 23:32:26 30% of the country's energy is produced by coal, and growing. It's better than being reliant on foreign oil
6894 2018-05-18 23:32:18 Oil companies making record profits.
Taxes,  price per barrel, exports .
Cost to Americans . The heating costs this winter are projected by my fuel company +25-30%.
6895 2018-05-18 23:32:09 I only didn't put enough oil in the pasta, now I'm sad
6896 2018-05-18 23:32:04 making matching scent beard oil and lotion this weekend.

6898 2018-05-18 23:31:52 pour it in the tub like bath oil or like foam bath. then bath.
6899 2018-05-18 23:31:51 .....Also, it will kill Laziness and lack of initiative that reign supreme among virtually all our states, whereby without federal handout that is gotten from Niger Delta oil,from Abuja every month end, 97% of our states can't survive....#TrueFederalism

6901 2018-05-18 23:31:48 Because the oil companies got those great tax cuts and gave out tremendous bonuses to there workers. So they have to make up some of those bonus dollars. 
Yeah
6902 2018-05-18 23:31:35 What are you most excited for during early access, is there a planned MMR/Ranking system for early access that is displayed, and what is your favorite oil to cook with? (Specifically for chicken)
6903 2018-05-18 23:31:28 Dear Sarah - take some paracetamol and evening primrose oil, change your tampax, but some chocolate and STFU.

6905 2018-05-18 23:31:11 Ew I hate waiting on oil changes :-)
6906 2018-05-18 23:31:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, yet revisit them.
6907 2018-05-18 23:30:56 The Bush family, the Saudis investing in Texan oil fields and vice versa, box cutters and edited "live" corporate channel footage. The truth is out there.
6908 2018-05-18 23:30:54 Obama made America independent of foreign oil by utilizing other renewable resources.
6909 2018-05-18 23:30:42 Working that 5:30 Friday oil.

6914 2018-05-18 23:29:54 You are misinformed. Price depends FIRST on the price the Arabs and Iranians and other Middle East countries determine what the price should be per barrel. In addition to what we pay at the pump, our tax dollars award millions to oil and gas companies here in the US.
6915 2018-05-18 23:29:44 Like clean air energy and clean solar energy. Do you know that we don’t need oil or coal right?
6916 2018-05-18 23:29:42 How come oil keeps going higher making Putin lots of money!
6917 2018-05-18 23:29:36 Castor oil cured my baldness
6918 2018-05-18 23:29:20 Of course, my prize possession in grammar school was a transistor radio. The shitty batteries back then didn't last long, so my parents rationed the batteries!
6919 2018-05-18 23:29:20 Told the gas lady find me some cannabis oil because I’m not going back to the er no more
6920 2018-05-18 23:28:51 Then why are we getting raped at the retail pump while big oil continues to make billions in profits?
6921 2018-05-18 23:28:46 Keep the mosquitos away with a few drops of Eucalyptus Oil on your ankles &amp; wrists.
6922 2018-05-18 23:28:17 I think I’m going to make a drawing with lavender oil pastels, while I’m stoned out of my head to forget my disastrous home decorating skills and any offensive words I might have uttered in a moment of not thinking.
6923 2018-05-18 23:28:11 @ChickfilA must have seen that video of people giving feedback after trying it for the first time.

My meal in on some next level stuff tonight!! The breading is nice and crisp. The fats taste like the oil was changed, just for me. The fries have more crisp (better imo) God bless

But the Rothcshild Oil Barons own him (as they do everyone else). Did you know Ivanka dated Nat Rothschild before having to settle for Kushie?
6925 2018-05-18 23:28:00 As the Alberta Government takes their oil royalties in kind my guess is that they will want to preferentially ship their royalty barrels on TMX to the export market and fetch a higher price.
6926 2018-05-18 23:27:55 My dude.  Peak oil, depleted ozone, Trump...the future is telepathic cockroaches who know how to mix a mean negroni.
6927 2018-05-18 23:27:52 reminder that obama administration lifted the oil ban export, promoted fracking and made it a thing across the globe and approved the equivalent of 10 keystone XL pipelines. he's wasn't "good" on climate. #tytlive
6928 2018-05-18 23:27:52 This wonka oil cartridge is bomb
6929 2018-05-18 23:27:46 I think the market is ripe for actual snake oil to return to the shelves.

6935 2018-05-18 23:25:55 cool it down with ice or cold water somehow.
after at least 20mins of getting the temperature down you could try putting aloe vera gel and/or lavender essential oil on it. both should be ok to put near the mouth but try not to swallow too much of it.
6936 2018-05-18 23:25:51 Quids pros and quos. That oil is flowing. Shame @PRyan
6937 2018-05-18 23:25:44 pine nuts/walnuts - fresh basil - garlic (quantity depends on taste, I use a lot because I am insane) - olive oil. 
Replace basil with sun-dried tomatoes for a killer pesto rosso.
6938 2018-05-18 23:25:40 "We should never forget that the most powerful people in the world exploited the greatest tragedy in American history to go to war in a country that had a lot of oil."

@BenMank77, every time I hear you say that in the #TYTlive promo, I get chills. Without fail. Heartbreaking.

Damn supernaturals ruined me
Thanks dean and sam
6942 2018-05-18 23:25:10 An industry entrenched in outdated, expensive maintenance repairs and technology is not gonna last in a capitalist country.  What you're doing is crony-capitalism, it's Anti-American.  As coal and oil, surprassed horses and buggies, clean energy is now surpassing coal, and oil.
6943 2018-05-18 23:25:10 I dub this, 'Oil Communism'. In B4 the next invasion!
6944 2018-05-18 23:25:04 My car needs an oil change, the low tire pressure light is on, and my miles to E is at 0...this all should work out fine, right??
6945 2018-05-18 23:24:54 Anyone who is bothered by paying 20%+ more at the pumps doesn't like it. Big oil is making record setting profits with tax, price , export . 
Middle class pays .
6946 2018-05-18 23:24:46 What these clowns can't seem to grasp is that if the owners ever did get bored or run out of "oil money" any potential buyer of the club would also need to be a billionaire in order to be able to afford the club based on its current value...  
End of argument..
6947 2018-05-18 23:24:36 So if things are so great, tax breaks, economic growth, and we have all this gas and oil - why are gasoline prices jumping up #greed

6955 2018-05-18 23:23:36 Guess the oil takes must of the boom making it tiny.
6956 2018-05-18 23:23:35 Now GO TO WORK on the OIL CARTEL that is INFLATING the PRICE of GASOLINE! The FIVE Major Refiners are COLLUDING to FIX PRICES that are ARTIFICIALLY HIGH!
6957 2018-05-18 23:23:32 There is no such thing as clean coal. There is no market for coal anymore. It is going the way of whale oil.
6958 2018-05-18 23:23:09 The Democrats starting with Jimmy Carter said we were going to run out of energy any day now and we had to rely on the sun and wind! It turns out the Democrats are liars, we also have enough oil and natural gas to last hundreds of years!

6962 2018-05-18 23:23:04 There was never a war on coal.  There is cheaper and cleaner energy available and it doesn’t involve oil.  But then there wouldn’t be all of that cash for you and your fellow thieves.
6963 2018-05-18 23:23:02 He needs to be lowered one inch per hour into a vat of hot boiling oil.

6965 2018-05-18 23:22:32 Yep, so great our gas prices just keep going up. Nothing like lining the pockets of big oil at the expense of regular people. But by all means, keep cheering that we are sending it away.
6966 2018-05-18 23:22:26 my car gave up on me today bc i needed an oil change .. $50 fkn$$
6967 2018-05-18 23:22:09 By increasing our dependence on foreign oil? Coal is dead. We need clean, renewable energy, not fossil fuels.

6979 2018-05-18 23:20:27 The EU is betraying the US by introducing the Block Statute laws to protect EU firms doing business with Iran. And they want to buy Iran oil with Euros. America should take a very strong stand against EU and introduce punitive sanctions to bring the EU to toe American line..
6980 2018-05-18 23:20:13 You just gotta love the hypocrisy. B C Attorney General David Eby going to Alberta’s Queens Bench to overturn Bill 12 restricting the flow of oil to BC declaring it as unconstitutional on the grounds that one province cannot punish another. WTF!! Seriously?
6981 2018-05-18 23:20:06 Trump is insisting on developing something the majority of the world does not use. #Putin pushes oil. What most of the world actually uses. Do I have to spell it out for your how this policy benefits #Russia followers? I know you know how Joey. #Russian #troll
6982 2018-05-18 23:20:03 Obama Admin and interest groups tried hard to steer us away from our own energy, set us to the mercy of foreign oil moguls.
6983 2018-05-18 23:19:58 No manches, lleve mi carro to get an oil change y cuando me lo trajieron de lavarlo el guy había dejado su número en my car boy byeee
6984 2018-05-18 23:19:57 So, I was at the beach today... Well.. sitting on the edge of the prom bit, anyway, I saw a the left over layer of the "palm oil fat berg" splashing up the rocks, it was truly heartbreaking. Humans, we suck. 
6985 2018-05-18 23:19:57 CBD oil is legal everywhere. Does not actually contain THC.
6986 2018-05-18 23:19:44 Bruh, these pics can be easily 30 years apart  photo on the left, you got a track with Kieth Sweat called "Brush my hair slowly" and the right just told me "Get ya beard oil game up old sport" 
6987 2018-05-18 23:19:17 oh!イル
6988 2018-05-18 23:19:14 God’s prophesy says He will dry up &BURN up OPEC’s OIL SOURCES so His favored USA &ISREALso only 2 Nations will b EXPORTERS OF PETROLEUM & NATURAL GAS toWORLD! We will completely pay off $23Trillion DEBT! God’s judgement will be on SYSTEMS & Leaders not on or
6989 2018-05-18 23:19:10 You don’t think so idiot?  Start war talk in the countries that have oil, we don’t get it from there and we pump from the USA. Smaller supply, higher price. Any more questions? It’s called supply and demand.  Look it up.
6990 2018-05-18 23:19:10 good dick, $4 peach scrub from target (their brand) and Nivea almond oil lotion!!! (Best lotion everrrr! Gets rid of scars)
6991 2018-05-18 23:19:08 Coconut oil and an exfoliating mit works wonders for meeee
6992 2018-05-18 23:19:07 I need a side gig like this. just put body oil on dudes lol
6993 2018-05-18 23:19:02 Just remember... Popcorn is prepared in the same pot, in the same heat, in the same oil, but they don't pop at the same time. Don't compare yourself to others, your time to pop is coming! 
6994 2018-05-18 23:19:00 Need some oil and a massage for your pussy i think?? 
6995 2018-05-18 23:18:49 There is NO such thing as clean coal! The so called 'war on coal' is actually called progress! Let me put it so U'll understand; As a professional conman, U don't sell snake oil anymore right, because there's no market! Now U sell State secrets & influence! See! Progress! #Idiot
6996 2018-05-18 23:18:48 I don't think we should be shipping American oil overseas until we supply our own domestic need.  #energy #maga #trump2020 #gop #oil #kag
6997 2018-05-18 23:18:38 わああああ！！！！めちゃくちゃかわいい…！
6998 2018-05-18 23:18:23 Cramer pushes (pun intented) pot stocks and you all stand by while oil equities lift off. I don't understand
6999 2018-05-18 23:18:22 The biggest fake news, which gets everyone, always.
The UK doesn't sell oil or gas..gives it away for free...isn't affected by oil price. Then explain how the UK makes its money and link that to the GERS "geographical share" figure.
It literally boggles minds...the deception.
7000 2018-05-18 23:18:07 Conversion of coal into oil would give another avenue of energy independence & increase jobs & increase revenue reserves. We should also look at possible exportation of coal to countries that need or can use this source of energy. We are the "middle east" of rich coal reserves !!
7001 2018-05-18 23:18:06 I have Oriental rugs in my kitchen.  They add interest as well as color.  This room is so bland.  Something on the walls?  I have a huge oil painting of colorful flowers in a blue vase, picked up at a thrift shop for $50, as a back splash behind my stove.  Adds warmth.
7002 2018-05-18 23:18:00 @mjdart @siandart thank you for your patience. Learned so much about using oil paint. My teacher & classmates at @Footscrayarts are all excited about my painting. I don't know yet what is next. I focus on the moment and enjoy the process 
7003 2018-05-18 23:17:58 There is no war on coal. It's called progress. Coal is finite, dirty and working the mines gives you black lung (are miners even covered by insurance for that). Oil is also finite. Once it's gone, it's gone forever. What then? It needs replacing with other energy.
7004 2018-05-18 23:17:41 I forgot to take a picture, but I sauteed Vidalia onion, a sweet potato, and spinach in olive oil and fried the sausages in the pan with it. Used a Cajun seasoning mix.
7005 2018-05-18 23:17:38 Tea tree oil....  new favorite skin..
7006 2018-05-18 23:17:35 This is the new Sticks n stones saying for millenials
7007 2018-05-18 23:17:31 how about 2 new refineries? Then we could truly be oil, at least, independent.
7008 2018-05-18 23:17:29 AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO RESEARCH AND READ ( BLACKSTONE BAYROCK INDUSTRIES) and trumps debt to russia and why they helped trump get elected, russia has to have oil above a certain price in order to make a profit, read up on this and it is happening now #TrumpRussiaCollusion
7009 2018-05-18 23:17:22 BELLY FRIDAY AND I HAVEN'T A DROP OF OLIVE OIL
7010 2018-05-18 23:17:18 Its тяцмр's way of convincing his base the Trumpettes that destroying the planet and stuffing more money in his pockets from his Shell company investments in coal and oil is a "good thing". 
And sadly they are stupid enough to believe it!
7011 2018-05-18 23:17:16 If you want to loose weight you should not eat any butter .. but almonds is inflammatory because of the type of oil that is in them :)
7012 2018-05-18 23:17:13 Any good suggestions to get rid of acne 
I drink water like a fountain 
I’ve put less make up on and not so many days of doing it 
Coconut oil 
Face masks 

Help 
7013 2018-05-18 23:16:46 Trumps buddies own oil companies, Trump has control over prices, that’s why they are going up.
7014 2018-05-18 23:16:44 What oil/mix do you use?
7015 2018-05-18 23:16:44 هو علبة الcoconut oil الكبيرة من امتنان بقيت بكام؟ اصدموني
7016 2018-05-18 23:16:37 Is this a good thing? Who am I to listen to? The CEO's of the oil industry tell me that it's a hoax, while the Climate Change scientists who's checks depend on it being real tells me that it's true. When you lack the adequate knowledge you should refrain from forming an opinion.
7017 2018-05-18 23:16:33 Backing out of the Iran deal is contributing to the rise in oil prices and trump had control over that.
7018 2018-05-18 23:16:32 Dip your feet & hands in warm water, use peppermint oil or any minty bath products you have. You can fill the first couple inches of the tub &sit on the edge. Lean over & put something frozen on the back of your neck, bag of peas or whatnot. It’s supposed to redirect blood flow.
7019 2018-05-18 23:16:16 Wind and solar will be around billions of years after coal and oil are gone.
7020 2018-05-18 23:16:16 How about clean whale oil?  One step down from coal, but you can do it for New England!!
7021 2018-05-18 23:16:12 Gorgeous beautiful photo. Need a lot of oil and a massage that i would be happy to help you with.
7022 2018-05-18 23:16:03 Well back to Colorado Monday. My oil is out. Only had 15 days worth. Yay another adventure.

7026 2018-05-18 23:15:38 Me ayuda mucho el cbd oil. Ya no tomo 2 pastillas diarias para el dolor que me estaban dañando los riñones.
7027 2018-05-18 23:15:35 Solar made coal and oil to begin with.

Solar is cheaper now though
7028 2018-05-18 23:15:30 Quebec recently announced that with a three-billion-dollar investment, it will cut gasoline use by 40% by 2030. 

That’s 12 years from now. I think lots of oil reserves will be left on the ground. Looking at you #abpoli
7029 2018-05-18 23:15:24 Thank that BOZO in the WH for the high oil and gas prices. He’s causing all the turmoil in the Middle East
7030 2018-05-18 23:15:20 It’s cleaner than coal and oil. It just doesn’t put money in Trumps pocket b
7031 2018-05-18 23:15:16 If anyone is curious to what happens when you throw a lighter into 350 degree oil.... hmu
7032 2018-05-18 23:15:10 Praise to @realDonaldTrump . I just came from the gas station. The oil industry is GREAT AGAIN!
7033 2018-05-18 23:15:09 RT @LivingSafely: Cheez Whiz Cheese Dip this May? Its top four ingredients are whey, milk, canola oil and maltodextrin.

-Get regular trims

7035 2018-05-18 23:15:06 Beautiful clean coal is about as real as that ridiculous orange oompa loompa nutsack skin you walk around with. Snake oil salesman and low rent used car hustler who has to overstate his wealth and dick size to make himself feel better. Insecure LOSER!!
7036 2018-05-18 23:15:05 But gas prices? The president can’t do much to control the global oil market, with one exception - Middle East tensions. On that count, Trump’s policies there are directly related to some of the recent run up in prices.
7037 2018-05-18 23:15:04 Once read that that UK oil paid for all social benefits in the UK. That was in the 1990's..Stayed with me. Norway lived frugally for years, invested the profits. Now laughing, though unskilled. All skilled labour there by other EU citizens. Their 4 trillions should save them thg.
7038 2018-05-18 23:14:59 Those two a nuts! Glad I blocked and reported them.
7039 2018-05-18 23:14:46 Who is the number one supplier of oil to America? Canada ....dumb ass!
7040 2018-05-18 23:14:44 Create jobs, help the economy , save the planet n focus on renewable energy! Use technology n make us a world leader that can’t be held hostage by oil producers, etc.
7041 2018-05-18 23:14:40 Rosnef Oil for Vlad
7042 2018-05-18 23:14:29 If we have so much oil, why the high gas prices, why are they trying to limit wind and solar
7043 2018-05-18 23:14:29  cuz that shit is like gorilla glue. And I put a oil gel on top. I won't brush my hair  for like 3 days if u wrap it
7044 2018-05-18 23:14:29 What will you be peddling next? Whale oil?
7045 2018-05-18 23:14:27 He'll get bored before the oil runs out I reckon.

My god please like Isis, Iraq,  Syria or Afghanistan  top target is Scotland lol all for money and power over oil there just playing games with people's lifes.

7051 2018-05-18 23:13:46 I just read this and it is apparently oil based cleansing followed water based?? you learn every day
7052 2018-05-18 23:13:35 Yeah, and if he rolls back milage standards for cars we'll be importing oil again soon #idiot
7053 2018-05-18 23:13:28 He's always been self-serving. This is nothing more than his latest attempt to ride a popular wave to profit. He banked big on Never Trump and it blew up on him. Guy is a snake oil salesman.
7054 2018-05-18 23:13:24 Oh the CERTAINLY DO when they enact policies that directly affect the supply or  demand of oil.

By breaking the Iran deal, Trump DECREASED THE OIL SUPPLY. 

Go learn what that means.
7055 2018-05-18 23:13:20 I've been looking into buying some cannabis oil for my daughter. And I want to help her but I have no idea where to start. I've never been around any thing like but I was recommended by a friend Stephani to contact Doctor Carine (carinew45@gmail.com) or text (773) 672-4720
7056 2018-05-18 23:13:19 Do you know how many things can not be made if you do not burn coal? Many of them are in you home and your car. So even if you don't burn coal for energy, still need to burn it anyway, kinda like oil. Everything we wear and eat still needs oil even if we don't burn it.
7057 2018-05-18 23:13:15 That was before we had clean energy. Coal and oil are not clean energy.
7058 2018-05-18 23:13:05 Aww. Getting an oil well put in right behind my house, not on my property. Just hope the noise & all doesn't make me nuts. :(

7061 2018-05-18 23:12:52 John 17:11-19- Ecce quam bonum- How good and how pleasant it is when brothers and sisters live together in unity. It is like precious oil on the head, running down upon the beard, on the beard of Aaron, running down over the collar of his robes.
#Amen
7062 2018-05-18 23:12:48 at the end of the day you have realize that price is a ponzi scheme...as long as they get a greater fool to take it off their hands they will readily give it to him at high price., don't know how many fools believe it will get to 80:) the crash begins when they run out of fools.
7063 2018-05-18 23:12:42 Theyvdo when they shun the Iran Treaty and cause oil prices to rise you $&”!@
7064 2018-05-18 23:12:36 If I can be bothered to open the cupboard with my oils in or if the eggs are small I'll sometimes put a tbsp of olive oil in.

 Scottish Brent Crude Oil is trading today at $72 barrel. Production cost per barrel $44. Gross UK Tax paid 0% per barrel.
7071 2018-05-18 23:11:47 The United States will be exporting more oil than importing yet we have no new oil refineries.
7072 2018-05-18 23:11:33 motor oil cum..........
7073 2018-05-18 23:11:23 You realize that he's pushing coal not oil. Right? An energy source that dumps tons of carbon into the air and makes our children cough. I'm happy that it's too expensive to produce for anyone to buy.
7074 2018-05-18 23:11:21 Olive oil and rainboots, huh? Going to waterproof those seams and try that soon.
7075 2018-05-18 23:11:19 I have some essential oil pushers on my FB and they go "Don't take pills, take oil!"
7076 2018-05-18 23:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: day-old crust with greasy motor oil and pineapple.
7077 2018-05-18 23:10:55 Haha you guys were had KM doesn’t care. This oil will be trucked to Vancouver where it can replace the Alberta oil. You all just did the oil companies a favour, you increased their per unit profit compared to keeping it domestic. Way to hit them where it hurts.
7078 2018-05-18 23:10:54 Getting an oil change & I feel like I’m at a day care center.
7079 2018-05-18 23:10:48 How long is an oil change supposed to take? I’ve been waiting over an hour and getting super hangry
7080 2018-05-18 23:10:34 The potus stole 1.5 trill from us & gave it 2 millionaires & profited. Stole millions in oil from The Crimea & profited  w Putin. His businesses profiting greatly from his visits by him. Etc. & people are gullible enough 2 think 1/4 of his salary being donated is admirable.
7081 2018-05-18 23:10:24 The US is producing more oil than ever, yet we still have $3.00 gas. 

Blame it on OPEC!

7087 2018-05-18 23:10:08 Sigh. Well humans have difficulties understanding scarcity until it's too late. Did you know we are running out of optic quartz for electronics? And of sand for glass and cement? I know it sounds crazy, but to many an oil, food or coal shortage seems as crazy.
7088 2018-05-18 23:10:06 待つんだ・・・

7094 2018-05-18 23:09:24 What effect would that have on China’s currency reserves? Until the Yuan is completely backed by commodities such as gold, silver, or oil, widespread dumping of treasuries is unlikely, but as soon as enough of the Yuan is commodity backed, the Dollar’s death will be very certain.
7095 2018-05-18 23:09:05 Yes, they both smell like snake oil
7096 2018-05-18 23:08:59 That goes without saying. I couldn't wait to get a part time job, loved working and taught me to appreciate the value of my labor. Now 12 year olds get iPhone 10s from their parents.
7097 2018-05-18 23:08:54 Where was that beard oil comment?
Geez, I grow a beard to avoid extra hygiene steps, not to add more.

7117 2018-05-18 23:06:55 Listening to @jjhorgan on @cknw repeating the term "diluted bitumen". It reminds me of the @MapleLeafFoods add campaign where because something sounds technical it must be bad. The science says dilbit acts just like other crude oil #bcpoli @MikeSmythNews @keithbaldrey 1/
7118 2018-05-18 23:06:50 Oil dictators = KSA, arms industry = Israel, then their enablers and financiers in the West and East
7119 2018-05-18 23:06:37 Please lower gas at pump! It is way too high! We have plenty of oil!! God Bless you!
7120 2018-05-18 23:06:17 I got laid off from my oil and gas job, I’m struggling.
7121 2018-05-18 23:06:11 Mr. President, I don't think we shouldn't be shipping American oil overseas until we supplied our own domestic need.  #energy #maga #trump2020 #gop #oil #kag
7122 2018-05-18 23:05:38 Then, the PHL will be competing vs tsayna in gobbling all the oil n gas from that country. In return, the PHL can export all its agri and manufactured prods to that country instead of selling them to tsayna which buys so cheap.
7123 2018-05-18 23:05:32 You'd love our oil for your beautiful dreads!

7128 2018-05-18 23:04:44 There is no such thing as fecking  clean coal. 250,years is not sustainable energy and coal is expensive. Stop selling your snake oil
7129 2018-05-18 23:04:35 I want to say I’m shocked buuuuut  I’m not. It’s the classic snake oil salesmen scam. Pull the “volunteer” from the crowd. In reality it hilarious that they made it that obvious.

7134 2018-05-18 23:04:25 I'm just mad that my face burns these days  used to only need the basic Oil of Olay. I use the one with SPF 15, but got a light burn anyway.
7135 2018-05-18 23:04:15 Clubs running on purely OIL MONEY without any identity of their own.
7136 2018-05-18 23:04:05 Really is sad. Scotland lost the chance to cash in on its oil, even if free tomorrow. . We are seeing a temporary bubble of trumppolitics only here.  Everything will soon be green. Oil will only be used in plastics and some other products then. Until not at all. Very soon now.

7141 2018-05-18 23:03:54 Trump didn’t elect himself.  There were millions who bought his snake oil.  We can thank them for this mess- and Putin.

7156 2018-05-18 23:02:37 Perhaps u should read about withdraw from Iran deal and price of oil. Benefitting esp the Russians. Don't take my word for it. Google. read a little
7157 2018-05-18 23:02:36 well some methods replace buttering the bread with a layer of mayo. I've tried it and it's not bad, just use a thin layer. I mean basically mayo is just oil and eggs so it makes a good coating for browning bread
7158 2018-05-18 23:02:34 I wish @TheDemocrats were EQUALLY obstructionist to Bush's oil war, high drug prices, Palestinian genocide, college tuition, fracking, off-shore drilling, selling uranium to Russia, funding ISIS, Wall Street bailouts, things ALL Americans want....

7167 2018-05-18 23:01:43 Gartman talks so much nonsense it’s hilarious. The forward curve never accurately predicts. The term structure just moves with the front month over time. Buy oil beta names is the trade now we’re solidly in deficit

7180 2018-05-18 23:00:04 I remember clearly being taught in the early 70’s in MS that the world would be out of gas and oil in 30 years and we needed to find alt energy. They knew then that they had to control us by using their clean mate scheme.

7203 2018-05-18 22:56:05 Very true, however I did do my research as I got older so I could have a better understanding as an adult but honey listen! You ain’t LIED! My momma definitely got the OILI don’t think you’ve seen her before though she goes to a different church! Lol.

7233 2018-05-18 22:48:49 I know some who haven't left. Oil workers who once made well into the 6 figures serving at a restaurant for a fraction of what they once made. But seeing as how Calgary has had one of the highest unemployment rates in Canada since 2015, can't stay if there's no work.
7234 2018-05-18 22:48:42 Damian took my car for an oil change today and I got my favorite food. I’m a lucky girl 
7235 2018-05-18 22:48:37 Me: Hello, I would like an oil change.
 
Oil guy: Yea so we took a look at your car and every single piece of it is broken. You’re in luck cause we can fix it in 15 minutes for 3 million dollars.
7236 2018-05-18 22:48:30 So.. it's only our job to go in and *ahem* "fix" countries that have oil and minerals, like the middle East? Where exactly does our jurisdiction of world police end?
7237 2018-05-18 22:48:27 “Ada duit tak” Well, financing it is just a question of moving money around. Kind of, take a bit from Peter & allocating it to Paul. With high oil prices & a strong economy, it’s affordable for now.
7238 2018-05-18 22:48:01 It could be the tea tree oil i have now that i think about it
7239 2018-05-18 22:47:53 That's why so many in the 3rd world & indeed the developed world want to live here is it. You really have no idea, when you see the abject poverty in oil rich Venezuela.

7245 2018-05-18 22:47:12 Think of it like oil drops from transport. A similar amount of essential fluid is leaked from the combustion engines of every car, bus and lorry that you see on the road. Less well driven tarmac, but more secretly hidden socks. 
7246 2018-05-18 22:46:49 I think displacing Saudi oil is better for the world than boycotting your own country's oil. Until you shut down foreign oil, you have no argument against Alberta oil.

7249 2018-05-18 22:46:45 We repaired an oil rig and it gave us some money and told us to come visit it again
7250 2018-05-18 22:46:40 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
7251 2018-05-18 22:46:21 Did not know that. I’m also not fond of anyone trying to push an oil pipeline through the cascade mountains to the Salish sea, we share that.
7252 2018-05-18 22:46:16 Our own version of a “EU” would be one of the most, if not the, powerful entities in the world. Cooperation regarding to oil and gas, exchange of technology and ideas.. Peace and stability in the Middle East.. Iran is the main key. Once the IRI is gone, the possibilities are many
7253 2018-05-18 22:46:05 Every now many miles does a car need an oil change?!?                  Asking for a friend.

7255 2018-05-18 22:45:45 vietnam choice of selecting Russian oil exploration experts is a good choice to shoo away China’s interference in it’s territory,
7256 2018-05-18 22:45:37 Green capitalism is arguable worse than Oil capitalism as there is a finite amount of damage the latter can do before collapsing.
7257 2018-05-18 22:45:19 The whip shines like its baby oil on it
7258 2018-05-18 22:45:19 Turns out changing your oil while wearing a lime green shirt is a bad idea. My reflection on the oil made me think I had coolant in it. Almost gave myself a heart attack.
7259 2018-05-18 22:45:16 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
7260 2018-05-18 22:45:15 And if you have such a red hot Asian market how come you are selling to Washington INSTEAD of Asia. Port of Vancouver record show less than 3% of Alberta oil went to Asia last year. I think likely if Asia is interested, they want it FOB to destination.
7261 2018-05-18 22:45:07 “how much oil will i need for a 40:1 mix if i have 5 gallons of a gas” bitch idk ur asking the wrong person

7266 2018-05-18 22:43:52 When our governor stop depending on oil. Then illegal oil subsidy will be uncovered and punished. Until then government come, government go, the ineffectual leaders will still be crying over oil subsidy

7269 2018-05-18 22:43:24 Depends. Leaders can range. Oil ETF  for last quarter is about 11% return. WildHorse ($WRD) is a leader in oil returned 56% in the same period. Of course ETF strategy is doable if you dont have the time and okay with a smaller return
7270 2018-05-18 22:43:12 I just don't think Acosta merits Trump's time.

7272 2018-05-18 22:43:09 I think you get full value whether delivered to Oklahoma or Washington. The truth is Alberta bitumen is not 100% oil but is diluted & AB is paid a pricereflecting this. Would you pay full price for whiskey that was 25% water, well bitumen is 25% chemicals which must be removed.
7273 2018-05-18 22:42:59 My boy came threw with the weed vape HMU doe 50 for the oil
7274 2018-05-18 22:42:58 Of course I never joined! Am not fighting stupid wars over oil and killing innocent people. And aye what a excuse. There already in danger there in the middle East it's no a holiday ha

7281 2018-05-18 22:42:03 Liz Earle hair products are amazing! Shampoo and oil! It's all natural too
7282 2018-05-18 22:42:01 Someone commented recently how america should be grateful iran is not bombing them for flint and that conflict over oil pipes in native lands. The hypocrisy has always been strong.
7283 2018-05-18 22:41:57 Maria! It’s a shame whenever innocent lives are lost! We got rid of the red coats years ago why wake up for them? Raising olive trees in Crete & selling best olive oil in the world to the world, ice cream sundae! Γεια σου κούκλα!
7284 2018-05-18 22:41:57 If I were to give you a full body massage, which would you prefer, hot oil or maple syrup.
7285 2018-05-18 22:41:56 I cook with olive oil but like even granola bars have canola in them
7286 2018-05-18 22:41:35 BTW.. Steve dreams about running against Jess and Katie like a dog dreaming about a sirloin... at least Carpet Bagger Caforio has all his DCCC connections to run a good race... but he will LOSE AGAIN. Anyone know if Caforio ever moved TO THE DISTRICT? Does he still defend OIL CO?

7288 2018-05-18 22:41:01 no, coconut oil is our lube..... it lasts longer
7289 2018-05-18 22:40:48 Why we are at war in the ME: middle east political games are all about oil and stragetic geography for the major powers and has not to do with religion, except as a control tool...ie manipulation. major powers = major oil consumers us, russia, china.
7290 2018-05-18 22:40:30 The U.S. is drilling for oil everywhere but my backyard, yet gas prices are skyrocketing. I was informed that could not happen.
7291 2018-05-18 22:40:29 ベスーベスー！はははやめろってくすぐったい～
7292 2018-05-18 22:40:24 So the Green Party intends to purchase oil that avoids the carbon tax. Smart money saving move. Totally avoids the green cause and proves that the market finds a way. @BCGreens this is a good resume move!
7293 2018-05-18 22:40:24 @Coach_USA_ She made us stop in Suffern so she can add oil to the bus & now we’re going to die because she keeps braking extremely short everyone flies forward & shit falls on the floor. #JesusTakeTheWheel
7294 2018-05-18 22:40:13 Okay but he stepped on it. The oil popped so hard it hit my foot. It’s tragic.

Guess who's back, back again
Elon's back, tell a friend
7299 2018-05-18 22:39:13 We only get 18% of our oil from the middle east, and Saudi Arabia, supporting terrorism or not, sells most of it to us.  The U.S provides 40% of our own oil, and the rest we get buy from Canada and Venezuela.  Calling me an idiot doesn't change reality.
7300 2018-05-18 22:39:09 We dont get anything from iran oil included. Havent since the late 70's
7301 2018-05-18 22:39:09 Responsible procurement includes good healthcare for both land and people. It can be done safely & sanely. If we really want it. But its going to be we the people that must hold the oil companies to the full standard of quality & safety no matter what.

7315 2018-05-18 22:35:56 That Serve and Protect Act that just passed the House adds 10 years to assault on a cop charge.  With cops lying all the time and more in schools...that school to prison pipeline is about to make the biggest oil companies green with envy.
7316 2018-05-18 22:35:40 Oil on canvas .
7317 2018-05-18 22:35:26 That and incivility towards others. Just look at social media.
7318 2018-05-18 22:35:13 Literally where the fuck would I be without olive oil?
7319 2018-05-18 22:35:11 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
7320 2018-05-18 22:34:34 Mother Scratcher’s Li’l Blasters (hemp oil, seeds, dates and oat rolls). I’ve thought too much about this obviously.
7321 2018-05-18 22:34:31 I haven't followed every twist and turn with Trump/Russia, just most. It seems like part of the quid pro quo is going to involve QPI/Qatar being the middleman in the mysterious sale of shares of Rosneft oil which happened in Dec 2016
7322 2018-05-18 22:34:23 Could have said it any better.  He just looks like a snake oil salesman.
7323 2018-05-18 22:34:20 w o w why did my phone autocorrect three to "oil" when I sent this last night

7328 2018-05-18 22:33:52 oil prices are also skyrocketing under his authority as well. Why is he in cahoots with Putin? He doesn't need him, so what is getting out of the deal? More $$$$$$$, he's a greedy SOB too!

7333 2018-05-18 22:33:09 The stir fry mix, a personal favourite, has a mix of oriental greens, kale, rapini, mustard and chard. 

Just chop, fry lightly in oil, season and serve.
7334 2018-05-18 22:32:52 Oil lobbyists do not sell oil.
7335 2018-05-18 22:32:30 Fried anything = toxic oil consumption
7336 2018-05-18 22:32:08 You feel me, I was just joking until Olive Oil’s sister got mad 
7337 2018-05-18 22:31:56 This sounds awful but I can now tell 97% of the time looking at a politician speaking that they are GOP without even hearing what they say.  They look like a shyster snake oil salesman

7339 2018-05-18 22:31:51 I actually took the time to bring my car to get detailed since my mans always takes care of the rest like changing my oil, breaks, etc

7342 2018-05-18 22:31:33 Bless oil it is
7343 2018-05-18 22:31:33 And how do I invest other than buying the shares? Should I buy them a drill bit for an oil rig?
7344 2018-05-18 22:31:21 Harold, you don't seem to understand that we get full value for energy delivered to the west coast. It's oil delivered to Oklahoma etc. that has the discount. If the Americans want our oil and are the highest bidder, they can have our product and we'll take their money.

7354 2018-05-18 22:30:03 Much further in thrall to the oil industry
7355 2018-05-18 22:30:02 Trump just gave China another economic boost. French oil giant Texaco is leaving Iran’s oil fields to avoid US sanctions. Guess who’s replacing them? Chinese oil giants.
7356 2018-05-18 22:30:00 every oil change involves my being convinced my car trouble as i am.

7365 2018-05-18 22:29:08 #Kinder Morgan. a Texas company to buy pipe from Evraz, owned by Russian Oligarch Roman Abramovich, run by "guys from Chicago" to ship oil owned by Koch Brothers.  Cnd.  Canadian taxpayers to pay for the pipeline. Canada gets screwed, foreigners gain.
7366 2018-05-18 22:29:06 Ugh, I hate it when people co-opt feminist terminology to sell snake oil to (cis)women under the guise of “empowerment”
7367 2018-05-18 22:28:58 His hair oil must have seeped into his brain.
7368 2018-05-18 22:28:48 Perhaps I used too many big words the first time. I’ll try again. The big pipe we have now is too small to send oil & gas to both BC & Asia. We can just keep the one big pipe and send oil & gas to just Asia or we can put in one more big pipe and send oil & gas to both BC & Asia.
7369 2018-05-18 22:28:45 It's all about the money...Big Oil pays for these toads to say anything that stupid people who don't care about making an effort to seek facts or even have capacity to listen to the science. When Dems speak, it's intelligent, when GOPers speak it's void of intellect.
7370 2018-05-18 22:28:43 I need puff puff. Correct one. The one that is dripping oil and full of sugar

7400 2018-05-18 22:24:43 Nobody serious is advocating that oil and gas be abolished.  That is lunacy.  But oil and gas need to be extracted and moved safely and wisely.  This pipeline does not meet those standards.  The assessment was rigged, First Nations were ignored, and coastlines remain unprotected.

7414 2018-05-18 22:22:04 What qualifies as real? I'd say a 1 billion secret budget to recruit, train, arm and drug terrorists to fight a bogus jihad against a country that doesn't want to play along with your oil interests qualifies as real terror, doesn't it?

7420 2018-05-18 22:20:57 That’s why refried beans are so good. It takes no time. Just a can of cooked beans, black or kidney, or you can cook your own, some onion, garlic, cumin, cayenne, oil, sea salt, and just mash them in a pot with a potato masher. Done in 10-15 minutes.

7423 2018-05-18 22:20:47 Time for those of us who appreciate Canada’s world leading oil and gas industry to get much more active. We need to contest the radical fringe making life hard for Canadians!

7425 2018-05-18 22:20:26 I’ve been told this is where (if regulation requires it) an oil reservoir would be connected.
The skinny tube on top is for “overflow”.
In this case the reservoir is on top of the radiators.

7429 2018-05-18 22:19:49 Argh, Palm oil is indeed not good for my health.
7430 2018-05-18 22:19:21 Please don't do this. The oil companies will just raise their prices an equal amount. We'll save nothing and province will lose revenue. Reduce the fees we pay for our sticker and licence.  That's $$ we can actually keep.
7431 2018-05-18 22:19:18 May 1942: I am glad that the Japanese have taken the Philippines from the United States of America. With that they should be able to access the oil reserves there and make up for their reliance of oil from the US.

7448 2018-05-18 22:16:35 Gemma read on Facebook that a tiny bit of aromatic oil placed on the furnace filter will gently perfume the house. I am sitting outside wearing a respirator as I type this.
7449 2018-05-18 22:16:31 Yet, you say nothing about all the oil tankers shuttling oil from Alaska right by your doorstep everyday, would you prefer more oil via tank cars, ships or pipeline ?
7450 2018-05-18 22:15:58 Sounds like you a looking for an excuse to send our young men & women there under false pretenses! So that our treasonous government and their cronies elite can benefit from their oil supplies! Maybe a food for oil policy like Bush did ! FU!
7451 2018-05-18 22:15:34 Then you’d know that CA aerospace and agriculture only makes up 23% of the states revenue....feel feee to research how much Hollywood and silicon’s tech companies are responsible for....more than texas’ oil/fuel
7452 2018-05-18 22:15:31 You are right. We should use that money to subsidize the oil and coal industry instead.
7453 2018-05-18 22:15:19 I'm polished and painted. In the morning I just need fire and oil and I'm good to go.

7465 2018-05-18 22:13:09 As an American, they will never take guns away.
There is too much money sitting on the table.
Guns are as big as the oil industry.
In America, anything that makes money, the govt controls.
Same reason why pot is still illegal, too much money left on the table if we made it legal.
7466 2018-05-18 22:13:08 My main point is that most of our ‘delicious’ Nigerian soups and dishes use palm oil and our unhealthy diet is killing us. I’m a Pharmacist. I can tell you how many patients I wouldn’t have if they just eat right.
7467 2018-05-18 22:13:06 Both things are fuelled by the top 1% families (Rothschild, Rockefeller, Soros,etc), they own media, pharma, defence/weapons, banks, oil,etc).

7472 2018-05-18 22:11:32 ""Our native soups are based on high levels of palm oil and groundnut oil that put us at risk for high cholesterol levels, stroke and heart attacks."

7484 2018-05-18 22:09:44 Bitumen discount between U.S. light oil and Western Canadian Select (WCS) has to do far more with low quality and refining costs than transportation issues.  The $15 billion number is pure fiction.  Plus Asia pays less for similar heavy crude than USA does. No riches coming.

7491 2018-05-18 22:08:51 @jimcramer . Hey... Oil/gas prices and retail stocks strong this month.  Aren't they competing for same pocket?  Retail can't stay strong with rising oil prices, yes? Seems consumer absorbing and inflationary inputs well, for now.

7494 2018-05-18 22:08:16 In this case, almost any liquid will do which will thin the oil. A small amount or sulphuric acid, varnish, water-glass, or linseed oil will be especially effective.

7515 2018-05-18 22:04:48 Just like your mom I too saved the bacon grease and use to put in a jar and refrigerate it and then use it instead of oil for soups, burgers or whatever you might want a bacon flavored dish without actually frying bacon

7525 2018-05-18 22:02:52 Also the fakery of environmentalists is every super tanker has a trail of oil that can be followed for miles. No foreign oil company can come close to the regulation and ethics of Canada’s oil industry. Global oil companies are run by wealthy elites who love war&hate 1st nations

7531 2018-05-18 22:02:14 Supply and demand. US pulling out of Iran deal is having a effect on the price of oil.  Thus retailers expect to face higher prices thus they need to charge more. We all pay it because we have very low elasticity of demand = price increase, demand stays the same

7533 2018-05-18 22:02:01 The real enemies of Nigeria's economy 

1. Politicians
2. Oil marketers
3. Security agencies
7534 2018-05-18 22:01:55 What reasoning do you have to ask such a stupid question? Are you trying to illicit a response to spin it your way? We GAVE billions in credits to Oil. Time they paid us back.
7535 2018-05-18 22:01:30 Truffle oil is shit

7539 2018-05-18 22:00:43 I'm glad to share, I love it! My bf usually adds olive oil on top, but I didn't add it since the tomatoes were already soaked in. 
7540 2018-05-18 22:00:42 chickadees are so cute
7541 2018-05-18 22:00:34 what I learned from exams is that sir Robert Clive was an olive oil tester who’s height was less than 90% of the population of high class Indians with a systolic blood pressure of >122 mmHg in the midst of mass violence during the twentieth century #apstats #APworldhistory
7542 2018-05-18 22:00:32 Man all bias aside, the shit the dawn brigade did was Super Fucked Up sometimes
Remember when micaiah tries to pour oil on the Pegasus knights and set them on fire after trapping them ???
What the FUCK kind of shit was that, that sounded like the tellius equivalent of a war crime
7543 2018-05-18 22:00:26 I’ve only had Jason & the Argan Oil but I’m sure the others are fantastic too.
7544 2018-05-18 22:00:25 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
7545 2018-05-18 22:00:00 And the US uses fracking to destroy our planet's water as well as building pipelines to transport and spill that dirty oil, but instead of us getting healthcare, only a few corporations get rich.

(PS, Canadians' income taxes pay for their healthcare)
7546 2018-05-18 21:59:57 Yes, but all this is happening BECAUSE the Fed is hiking rates.  

So it's really "Fed raises" -> Recession.  Just like the last N times.  

/Well, except the oil prices.
7547 2018-05-18 21:59:54 Stonehenge is my favourite spiritual place..full of Swampies ..but always stop for coffee there .Fek em!

7549 2018-05-18 21:59:30 waterrrrrr & coconut oil are the keys to life
7550 2018-05-18 21:59:01 This is the type of society that environmentalists prefer us to import our oil from.
7551 2018-05-18 21:58:44 The cbd oil isn't placebo, I had my mom take it for help w pain mgmnt. From my experience cbd takes the pain down a level? But I haven't tried your full power stuff so ymmv. The lavender shit is aesthetic tho. (not a bad thing)
7552 2018-05-18 21:58:28 Night ..I'm going back to my music ..and flitting to ukog lse bb to read Swampys bs. And Angs BB to read Allan Wolfe's and ibug bullshit .x
7553 2018-05-18 21:58:27 I can imagine the TSX jumping 10% in a short order - Good bank results, idiots selling the dividend payers stop selling, investors remember that we are all addicted to our phones and oil stocks really price in $70 oil. I can only dream
7554 2018-05-18 21:58:15 Pipeline debacles are too artificial. The top level Canadian elites worked in secret with Saudi & Israeli war crooks. Keeping Canadian oil out of world markets allows the Saudi- Zionist axis to have higher oil prices. Then they have funds to  kill off their Mid East enemies.
7555 2018-05-18 21:57:57 I believe you also get paid to keep them, even though you’re buying oil from Isis and treating their terrorists in your hospitals - such allrounders how many Syrian kids are working in your factories and their women turning to prostitution - you really like to help

7560 2018-05-18 21:57:04 we need to star praying for our president, if God hear all of us praying & working together saying forget the negativity & ask for that man’s mind to be healed with love, care, understanding, equality & justice Lord if I could Trump head with some Holy oil I would!!
7561 2018-05-18 21:56:51 Only terrorist in Syria is US looting Syrian oil. Pres Putin step in. Syria desperate need protect resources against US army extract & loot oil Middle East. Extremist Groups iSIS called terrorist by trying protect resources against white elite from USA
7562 2018-05-18 21:56:47 No matter where they stand on a $3.8Bn pipeline that would funnel oil through their state, North Dakota legislators have grown weary of a year of protests that have brought international scrutiny and a mounting police bill.

So they’ve drafted legislation in direct response to...

Tonight I decided to toss them in olive oil, lemon juice, rosemary, salt, & pepper and baked them for a while from frozen 

They’re AMAZING
7576 2018-05-18 21:55:37 Climate change = no more oil in #Canada = depending on Saudi Arabia for gas = following their rules = Sharia Law = spreading #islam

7578 2018-05-18 21:55:20 Literally the best. Fits more than you think. Got nearly a 100k on mine and take it from new haven to Chicago once a year just about. Normal care; synthetic oil, rotate tires, etc. and gas mileage is pretty great.
7579 2018-05-18 21:55:17 So worried about carbon emissions for the average joe but this bafoon fills his jet on Saudi oil and galavants all over the world making a fool out of himself

7581 2018-05-18 21:55:09 The existence of such an Anti-nation  and oppressive regime in the middle East has always been beneficial for big oil and weapon companies in U.S and Europe..So don't show off please!

7590 2018-05-18 21:53:32 The saturated fatty acid in palm oil is palmitic acid which raises LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) levels and puts you at risk of heart disease (If there is regular, consistent ingestion). Palm oil has good benefits too, but if you eat it every day, only you go know!
7591 2018-05-18 21:53:19 Sooooo today I have cleaned my room, did an oil treatment on my hair, conditioned & detangled it, shaved & exfoliated my skin, did a sugar scrub on my feet & now I’m sitting back with my hair wrapped.

7670 2018-05-18 21:43:52 Russia is at a 30 year record high of oil production. In addition, due to US sanctions they are quite limited in developing new oil fields, which IMO makes their capability of producing more very doubtful.
7671 2018-05-18 21:43:49 I been knew how to change oil  that’s easy

7680 2018-05-18 21:43:10 Aku juga lg nyobain yg sunflower oil ini
7681 2018-05-18 21:43:08 A recommendation to consume olive oil should come with a caveat. A recent 60 Minutes report found that distribution of olive oil is controlled by the Italian mob and most of it is adulterated. You should shop carefully, open your wallet, and get the real thing.
7682 2018-05-18 21:43:03 Went to get my oil changed in my truck and now they can’t even get it to crank back up..

7686 2018-05-18 21:42:40 Failed snake oil salesman @DanielJHannan now promoting 'no deal' #Newsnight
7687 2018-05-18 21:42:36 Just tried the baby oil trick for getting off fake tan.... still orange but now I’m water proof
7688 2018-05-18 21:42:36 What’s curious is REAL conspiracies are seldom targeted by conspiracy theorists. Examples: a big car manufacturer systematically manipulating pollution tests. Utility companies secretly fixing prices. Oil companies siphoning money to discredit climate scientists.
7689 2018-05-18 21:42:36 so if you can just put oil into "Energon" cubes and convert it into "energy" would that basically be a means of basically pollution free petroleum?
7690 2018-05-18 21:42:24 Trump tweets whatever gibberish is going on in his head and the price of heating oil skyrockets. 
7691 2018-05-18 21:42:22 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

7693 2018-05-18 21:42:13 I know which company E works for. Hope they come back soon lol. About 1.2p?

7695 2018-05-18 21:41:53 I just watched a news story on @WatchCTVNews about @Greenpeace and how they don’t want #Canada to build #Pipelines. The #oil industry is a large part of our GDP, and we can’t just turn off the taps. Oil powers our society.
7696 2018-05-18 21:41:13 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
7697 2018-05-18 21:41:12 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7698 2018-05-18 21:41:06 Do u need an oil change?
7699 2018-05-18 21:40:58 My moms friend just gave me an edible & let me hit her vape with the oil stuff. What a time to be alive.

7706 2018-05-18 21:40:01 My housemate just put calming lavender oil on my wrists and temples because I'm so stressed, moral of the story- my housemate is better than yours
7707 2018-05-18 21:39:53 castor oil really works on regrowing your brows if like me i plucked them to death in the 90s lol

7709 2018-05-18 21:39:32 You have to hustle with like minded individuals, The hustle is dark and lonely. 
You have to burn that mid night oil, so if you’re not all by yourself with that note book executing your ideas and following up. 
FOCUS. Keep that hustle up!! 
7710 2018-05-18 21:39:32 Witch hazel, then hit the baldy with an essential oil. Find one that works for you. This week I'm using aloe vera castor oil. (This ain't a joke btw, take care of your scalp)
7711 2018-05-18 21:39:21 And palm oil
7712 2018-05-18 21:39:16 No I haven't but I asked my dad who travelled round the world as he was dying where's you're fav place..he said Marisious. Good enough. Ps to Eddie My Dad built Nuclear Power Stations in 70s.Project manager and Great Guy.
7713 2018-05-18 21:39:06 Left the baby oil at home remember? Haven’t been able to find a big enough bottle here yet.

7716 2018-05-18 21:38:50 I’ve never made wings at home before because I refuse to deal with the oil. These were easy.
7717 2018-05-18 21:38:39 Great idea except if #Congress turns a blind eye to the rampant speculations and manipulation of #Oil price and the price gouging of gasoline and diesel is to ignore the hyperinflation causing consumer's great financial difficulty.
#PuntWW
7718 2018-05-18 21:38:37 haha! true. I'm an unconscious comedian. Trump did say at a meeting, "Why can't we just go in and take their oil?" you know he allegedly wanted to nuke France in the past. I think Iraq and Afghanistan were silent take overs. Israel will pay for what they do now too after trump
7719 2018-05-18 21:38:27 that's great, all we had back then was our imagination. Hope you were able to sell your stories!
7720 2018-05-18 21:38:15 ...that is inbetween invading Syria killings the Kurds, going on a day trip to Iraq and buying oil from ISIS. How you defend him is beyond me I would be embarrassed
7721 2018-05-18 21:38:10 Many British Columbians are with ya Alberta. Do what’s needed to get that oil to market!
7722 2018-05-18 21:37:43 OPEC is already cooperating with non-opec members. I think they’re worried that oil prices might go too high that it might slow down the world’s economic growth, which affect oil states in one way or another, including oil demand. Also makes shale oil more attractive.
7723 2018-05-18 21:37:18 Greasemonkey just changed my oil in 25 minutes which is 2 hours faster than Midas and now I’m so upset I’ve been going to Midas all this time
7724 2018-05-18 21:37:18 More companies need to be forced to make more enviro friendly packaging and products. Our candles are made with soy wax which is renewable unlike paraffin wax candles which are a byproduct of oil/coal production.  This is a great start!
7725 2018-05-18 21:37:05 No such thing as Scotland by your own "logic" then. West Coast Gealic speakers will need passports to entire the oil Capital of Europe in Pictland.

7729 2018-05-18 21:36:17 Only way to get oil companies attention is going green - electric cars. 
Never mind this sham called carbon pricing, its another fucking tax. And the #pcpo and #ndp wll also roll out something similar, just under  different name - but its still a tax, a revenue stream. #onpoli

7740 2018-05-18 21:34:44 WIsh I were on commission for this stuff!
Stain Devils (ballpoint and felt pen) by Dr Beckman(n?) - it's available at Woolies. Just in case you've had an unsuccessful go at it with something else already, loosen it up again by massaging eucalyptus oil into it, wash, then treat.

7754 2018-05-18 21:33:17 Let me answer your first, badly phrased question. Why do only “shithole” countries want to join? Because all the non-shtohole countries are already members. Norway doesn’t need to. They’ve been very lucky with oil. Have you been switerzland? I have, many times. Fucking expensive

7761 2018-05-18 21:32:19 What kind of trucks, Toyotos or Big trucks, semis? What were the trucks carrying, produce, oil, what? Was there no armed escort? between Sabha and Jufra quite a distance, no way to be more precise?
7762 2018-05-18 21:32:18 The oil they put on after usually does that so I guess that was free too
7763 2018-05-18 21:32:17 I was worried that might be the case, and totally understandable.  You might try the oil and see if it helps.  There are some reports that it can.
7764 2018-05-18 21:32:14 Outrageous gas prices also caused by consumers - who will always pay posted price - Always. Gas companies know it, and so do the politicians, who also happen to have travel budgets to offset their direct costs. Never mind that big oil owns many politicians & all of the parties.
7765 2018-05-18 21:32:13 Spent $700 on my damn car this week and I still need to fix my windshield and change the oil.
7766 2018-05-18 21:32:12 Getting out from under the contaminated environment they left! Typical move of big gas and oil...

7779 2018-05-18 21:30:16 Using the question in its purist form, I had to say America.The logistical supplies in fuel, oil, arms and so many troops, although as a Brit it gives me pride that Britain held on against the odds, without American aid we eventually were stuffed.
7780 2018-05-18 21:30:10 Agree, but maybe trump isn't real smart. Animals, by and large, do not kill other animals for reasons other than survival. People are humans.  Only humans kill humans for: territory, revenge, oil, power, money, terror, fun. He must stop denigrating animals.
7781 2018-05-18 21:29:42 ‘Populist governments’ are like ‘unconventional oil’.
After around 10 years, they simply become the “new normal”.
7782 2018-05-18 21:29:34 Do you know what a lobbying organization does? Do you think oil lobbyists sell oil?
7783 2018-05-18 21:29:31 I would agree, except I think his “snake oil philosophy” is pretty related to the things he’s an expert in. That said, I don’t read or watch any of his stuff so what do I know
7784 2018-05-18 21:29:09 If I ask my doctor a medical question, I expect honest answers. If I ask about cancer treatments, he or she better not just offer me only turmeric and coconut oil because politicians don't like chemotherapy. Forcing doctors to lie to patients is unacceptable.
7785 2018-05-18 21:29:08 @SophieASlut going to get the oil out and watch you getting fucked like the dirty slut that you are sexy 
7786 2018-05-18 21:28:56 It is for the 48, I don't know where the oil came from but it is all over the curb, gutter and street where ppl get onto the bus. Thank you!

7788 2018-05-18 21:28:51 The Province of Alberta takes oil royalties in kind and sells directly  to the market. So selling oil at the higher world price means immediate revenue for Alberta and Canada by way of transfer payments. Then increased corporate, personal and property taxes.
7789 2018-05-18 21:28:47 Yes I do. I don't just use my binoculars for oil tankers.
7790 2018-05-18 21:28:35 I love burping up 'black cumin seed oil' lol

7794 2018-05-18 21:28:24 My bf got his oil changed and it only took 10 min but Fox News was on the tv and holy cow did I feel dumber listening to that drivel. Roundtable discussions are some of the worst thing to happen to news coverage sometimes, I swear.

7798 2018-05-18 21:27:57 I work as a tech doing oil and tires. But my room mate and I do like 90% of our own mechanic work
7799 2018-05-18 21:27:37 No I tend to try and leave them until the FLO have seen them but a few items went into the oil before realising they where something that could be recorded so they smelt like a chip shop for the FLO lol. I normally boil off the oil before leaving to dry and then wax
7800 2018-05-18 21:27:36 Maybe a change of oil....
7801 2018-05-18 21:27:26 Cydm fr scshots
7802 2018-05-18 21:27:25 Exactly - whole debate about Bitcoin energy use is very similar to that around “Peak Oil” in my opinion. If we use more energy, incentive to invest in new energy sources will increase, leading to increased effficiency & tech. Explains why “peak oil” predictions have been wrong.
7803 2018-05-18 21:27:07 There is no way you met at college.Eddie looks much younger than you!
7804 2018-05-18 21:27:00 I dunno I imagined things pretty graphically as a kid. I also used to write short stories though so maybe that's why lol
7805 2018-05-18 21:26:50 Nigerians talk alot about diversification from Oil and gas. But all Majority of the population keep talking about is Agriculture and Tech. Tech gan is not talked about like dat compared to Agric. I really feel people need to think deep beyond all these. So much ideas in me.
7806 2018-05-18 21:26:47 Me: ask 3 mechanics what oil to run in my trans before changing it               Also me: drinks Coors Light like it's going outta style

7811 2018-05-18 21:25:36 @wentworthsubaru @subaru_usa service sucks! They won't schedule appts for oil changes. You have to go to express. "Express" always has 1-2 hour wait! And no detailing appts till July? Disappointed!
7812 2018-05-18 21:25:30 I used too much bath oil and now I feel like a condom.

7816 2018-05-18 21:25:03 Have I shared my John Otway videos, lol
7817 2018-05-18 21:24:44 Those that wear white robes should not go to where palm oil is sold.

Do not partake in inrrelivance for thereto lies flimsy things that will not benefit you.
7818 2018-05-18 21:24:38 You buy oil and gas from the better and trustworthy supplier and that is ALWAYS RUSSIA for Europe.

So tell the US to fuck off and build their pipeline & see who wins also get out of occupied nations too!

7829 2018-05-18 21:23:32 You promised to stop American Corporations from "ripping off" the American public. Why are gas prices rising? Every year it's the same damn thing. Gas up in summer, diesel and fuel oil in winter. Look at their profits. Record breaking. The American people lose again Thanks idiot.
7830 2018-05-18 21:23:29 Serving halal meat on offshore oil platforms in the North sea now too. They claim it goes through the same slaughter procedure.
7831 2018-05-18 21:23:28 yeah, remember when Iraq and Libya tried to sell oil in Euros.... ;)
7832 2018-05-18 21:23:20 No ones listening, lol
7833 2018-05-18 21:23:14 $XOP.V $COPL.L $VELXF Another small cap oil play. More speculative, and not nearly as exciting as $EGL.TO. Currently raising funds to finance the takeover of a Nigerian oil asset. If/ when this happens, it'll be exposed to Brent pricing. Tiny position. #pennystocks.
7834 2018-05-18 21:23:12 Sorry Joe I don't see it. Dollar shortage is real, Euro longs have  barely sold. You should want a dollar rally to help your oil short.  Oil cannot ignore the USD for much longer. PAYtience.

7836 2018-05-18 21:22:55 Gonna start doing my own oil changes
7837 2018-05-18 21:22:53 :)
7838 2018-05-18 21:22:53 Came to get an oil change not for you to tell me my car needs 6 million things.
7839 2018-05-18 21:22:51 Then he'll turn around and sell chunks of Bears Ears to big oil and mining anyway.
7840 2018-05-18 21:22:46 There's dumb, and then there's Texas politician dumb. 

Too stupid to be in the oil business? Can't get a CDL to drive a beer truck? Texas has a place for you in elective politics!
7841 2018-05-18 21:22:45 Please stop this and go back to what you're good at, like bombing any country with oil.
7842 2018-05-18 21:22:44 My first oil art tiles,..instructed in Mexico,..did one all on my own today,..I can't show the fourth one because it is my sisters Birthday Present,..these are one for me,..one for mom and one I did for my AMAZING Brother Timmy Hanks — feeling fantastic
7843 2018-05-18 21:22:38 Nonsense. No such thing as sustainable palm oil, unless grown in the country of its origin. Ask the orangutans
7844 2018-05-18 21:22:37 Come on..you can tell me Heid..I won't say a word :(
7845 2018-05-18 21:22:27 Sounds crazy but coconut oil swish and chew until it’s foamy then rinse ( don’t swallow it it pulls the ick out 
7846 2018-05-18 21:22:10 Like the idea of oil slick, as long as the material isn’t too shiny!
7847 2018-05-18 21:22:09 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
7848 2018-05-18 21:22:01 Haha my husband calls him a snake oil salesman too.
7849 2018-05-18 21:21:58 Getting my oil changed
7850 2018-05-18 21:21:56 Certainly good for Shell and BP and other oil companies. Good for British exchequer. Probably good for oil jobs. 
Not good for transport companies. Not good for cost of goods in shops. 
Not good for me.
Good for Scotland?

7863 2018-05-18 21:20:41 Nothing good. Box is a waste of money and time.

Cashew butter sweetened with stevia...some 10 yr old might think it's good but it's disgusting.

3 meat sticks 

Vanilla MCT Oil (see cashew butter review)

And some ketone piss strips. <--- amateur hour.
7864 2018-05-18 21:20:39 It’s because you’re threatening the status quo.
Stop trying to change the auto/oil industry and you won’t have problems like this.
7865 2018-05-18 21:20:36 holo holo holo !!!!! or what about sorta like an oil slick style you know what I mean like all duochromatic (I can only describe in eyeshadow finish apparently)
7866 2018-05-18 21:20:36 no...you wouldnt believe where I met Stuart. not dog walking. Dont often confess where but it is rather funny.
7867 2018-05-18 21:20:33 Instead of everyone being angry at the Alberta Government ask why the BC government is standing in the way of economic growth. Alberta and is people have the right to bring their oil to the international market. I dont like the taps being turned off but I get it. @jjhorgan
7868 2018-05-18 21:20:31 Have u ever had  a serious conversation with your oil drainer we like waste oil prefer clean oil (never get any though) but there are 2 things we don’t like 1 coolant wtf it’s basically water why would I want that 2 brake fluid just plain lazy I don’t like it and I don’t want it

7873 2018-05-18 21:19:49 I have not. Due to the fact that it’s federally illegal and I’m in a drug tested position, I really can’t. But I am considering trying cbd oil.
7874 2018-05-18 21:19:34 let’s talk about the aftermath of microblading! day 7: my brows are flaking and scabbing and sooooo itchy! i was keeping them moisturized with  oil but then someone told me to let them dry heal! they look like hell right now but i’m assured they will look amazing soon
7875 2018-05-18 21:19:08 No wonder you weren't up for changing people's oil that day.
7876 2018-05-18 21:19:05 That's enough now. Time to rub salt in Swampys wounds and make some money!

Such a disappointment.

7952 2018-05-18 21:08:49 Ok then if you aware of all these than the price of commodities should go up & not down from the monetary point of view, but taking into consideration oil stocks, rising production, Iran’s discounted price sale of oil to China it can go down. Therefore all depends on EIA reports
7953 2018-05-18 21:08:38 'And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah.' - Bible #ALDUBUwiNaTayo
7954 2018-05-18 21:08:38 I just started it! And I am using a few other products (I'm desperate) so it'll be hard to say how effective just the emu oil will be. Someone else just responded that they have found it really effective for certain #pain.

7956 2018-05-18 21:07:57 Just misread a Glade ad as “Glands Plug-ins Scented Oil”
7957 2018-05-18 21:07:56 Exactly. There should be a nationwide movement for this, but because the car and oil companies pay politicians and the media not to report on this no one talks about it, but they do report on gun control so its a bigger issue.
7958 2018-05-18 21:07:56 what a woman...wonder who she is like. ??!!

7960 2018-05-18 21:07:36 I think it's because he's a very carefully measured act, and by identifying then talking stoically (and crying) about male issues in a way few (left or right wing) manage it suckers men into overlooking the batshit insanity or snake oil he peddles around it.
7961 2018-05-18 21:07:30 I wanted to be an aircraft engineer with the RAF until I had a comment from the guy in the recruitment office "But your a girl, have you even changed the oil in a car before".
7962 2018-05-18 21:07:10 You can use them to infuse any herb into butter or any other oil. Rosemary garlic butter? Fuckin forget about it man.

7970 2018-05-18 21:06:32 Ok, my kids are watching a Minecraft video.  If you mix oil and fat, you make soap. And if you smash soap and graphite, you get graphene. And if you put graphene sheets together, you get a graphene block, which destroys everything. @Dichtel
7971 2018-05-18 21:06:22 Oooh we had a bottle of that a few months ago, it was that one or another one that tasted like it came straight out of a smoky peat bog. Hahaha, I prefer the honey-toffee-caramel flavours. We keep all the empty bottles and use them for olive oil containers haha.
7972 2018-05-18 21:06:21 Don't forget thoughts and prayers and if that doesn't work coconut oil.  Let's face it Trump is as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike.

7980 2018-05-18 21:05:13 Peak Oil
May be realized in the next 5-10 years or...has already been reached.
What may be more important:  whether the idea is relevant to market forces.
With a growing awakening to the value of #renewableenergy sources
demand for oil may be hitting its "peak" & in decline.
7981 2018-05-18 21:05:07 As the FT explains, it's a false barometer

"...over a sixth of its members are investment companies ...which have little to connect them with the UK...A tenth of FTSE 250 members are natural resources companies, whose earnings are dependent on the price of oil and metals."

7985 2018-05-18 21:04:46 I love watching ladies who never got an oil change or inspection sticker before it’s funny to me
7986 2018-05-18 21:04:36 I'm not gonna disagree with you completely, but we are still going to war with middle eastern countries over oil. Might not be land or food but tbh probably worse because oil isn't essential
7987 2018-05-18 21:04:27 It’s like you’ve forgotten the country you’re from. Rallying oil prices should be doing good things for us. But alas...
7988 2018-05-18 21:04:24 Fun fact: putting jeans on legs that have tanning oil on them is very difficult and not fun

7990 2018-05-18 21:04:17 drove past this last night while they were doing some kind of snake oil southern revival sermon and was 100000% confused at what in the living fuck I was witnessing
7991 2018-05-18 21:04:07 Him announcing the embassy in Jerusalem a couple months ago was his first effort to increase oil prices but it didn’t work, so he had to go through with it and try to bait Iran into a conflict.
7992 2018-05-18 21:04:06 Garlic cloved marinated in herbs in olive oil - honestly superb, u eat them like pickled onions they aren’t nippy like fresh cloves

8003 2018-05-18 21:03:04 @vanillaqueen Hi There.  Is vanilla a tracked commodity like Cocoa, Oil, etc?  I can't seem to find it anywhere and am trying to understand how a manufacturer that depends on the product would get a grasp on pricing and price trends. TIA!
8004 2018-05-18 21:03:03 Oil, by its nature a volatile commodity. When presented with the opportunity to secure purchase at its lows, it is only wise to make that investment. 

That was a colossal case of mismanagement and poor decision making by AudleyShaw.
8005 2018-05-18 21:02:58 Getting my oil changed. Wow, I'm such an adult.
8006 2018-05-18 21:02:55 Trump wants to start a war with Iran so he can increase oil prices because he is getting. $700 million dollar Russian oil company which is under sanctions and increased oil prices will keep the deal alive. It’s not hidden that he is getting a commission, as well Israel

8016 2018-05-18 21:01:06 Peak Oil
A confusing term not driven purely by supply and demand.
#PeakOil:  the amount of crude oil in situ and available for extraction.
Peak Demand:  global demand for #crudeoil, #shale (tight oil), & #naturalgas.
Peak Supply:  amt. avail. after extraction and refinement.

8080 2018-05-18 20:52:31 It seems to me whomever leaked the $200B number wanted disruption/conflict or to stall. The Yuan/Gold settled oil contract launched in Shanghai has to feed into these discussions and impact strategy. Not just about balance of trade.

8233 2018-05-18 20:31:07 We use the most saturated oil there is (palm oil) to cook our soups. How won’t it be unhealthy?
8234 2018-05-18 20:31:05 We all insist that RT's are not an endorsement, but it's brought down that anyone who RT's one tweet is regarded as if he RT'd the whole TL.

Good yomtov!
8235 2018-05-18 20:30:53 I'm getting an oil change at a new place. The manager just recognized my purse brand and complimented me on it. I am well on my way to becoming a loyal customer
8236 2018-05-18 20:30:27 $EGL.TO $EGRGF My other favorite upside play. Broke out yesterday on high volume, and held the breakout today. This is a $16m market cap oil stock, heavily exposed to WTI pricing, trades at 0.38x sales (0.2x book). INCREDIBLY cheap, even after breakout. No idea why it's so cheap.

8238 2018-05-18 20:30:18 5 years ago oil was 120 bucks a barrel and gas was 1.30 now its 70 bucks a barrel and its 1.40    Not much makes sense but lots people getting rich.
8239 2018-05-18 20:30:17 I noticed that.

8241 2018-05-18 20:30:11 Oil, like stocks, tends to go up over time, then it corrects violently. 2000, 2008, 2014... the appear to have a symbiotic relationship. 2018 next? #WTI
8242 2018-05-18 20:30:09 I wonder if they can exit without crashing oil prices, they have something like a billion barrels worth in a long position ?

8251 2018-05-18 20:28:36 Yield differentials collapse in recession, oil remains stable-ish. Not dominant for long bond

8253 2018-05-18 20:28:22 I’m still really uptight about my boss saying he didn’t like my lemongrass essential oil .... it’s been over a month and I’m still straight up pissed
8254 2018-05-18 20:28:12 And where would city be without the oil money??!!! Still getting spanked 8-1 by the likes of boro!!!
8255 2018-05-18 20:28:11 I really dont know why gas is so high. America’s oil supply is mainly domestic.
8256 2018-05-18 20:27:53 Thinking bigger picture than that personally. A stock market #crash in the Fall of up to 30% will take down oil with it imho, just like in 2008 and 2000. Then it will skyrocket like #Gold when the Fed and global CBs print their currencies into oblivion... imho. #WTI

8265 2018-05-18 20:26:44 Venezuela did what Saudi Arabia did with its oil wealth ie propped up despotic rulers and bought of population with cheap fuel & food & failed to invest in national prosperity. U.K. oil wealth misused by Thatcher to pay for mass unemployment in 80s. Tories shambolic with economy

8270 2018-05-18 20:25:09 I will do. Don't get me wrong I use THC infused coconut oil that I incapsulate but have to schedule for UAs and can't stay ripped for hours on end go to much to do.
8271 2018-05-18 20:25:06 Yeah...that sound just "drain the swamp". Shane @realDonaldTrump Cult followers lack the cranial capacity to see these issues and just admit they bought the snake oil.  Come back to reality. We'll be here waiting.
8272 2018-05-18 20:24:58 No,it's got alot to do with oil and guns hasn't it?Leastways,your fortuitous oil discovery in the 30s and it's now depletion.Shouldn'ta got greedy.

8275 2018-05-18 20:24:41 Love your words of wisdom.  Too often people “assume” they can just “live” (or own & not live) in a house.  Would they buy a car and never change the oil?  Oh wait, some people DO just that!
8276 2018-05-18 20:24:36 Duh...Nigeria is one of the biggest oil exporters n among the richest countries in Africa...I second trump, this is a shit hole country
8277 2018-05-18 20:24:30 Folks, isn't it time to fess up & say the #GOP experiment is a failure?

Remember this come November.

They bought stolen oil from ISIS, (the same trucks Obama refused to bomb)aided ISIS w medical supplies,ammo,etc. He killed/imprisoned other journalists. They R holding Christian Pastor on Fake Charges! They’ve murdered hundreds of Kurdish People.
8280 2018-05-18 20:24:06 Reasons are simply....they waited not because of election but because of recession due to lack of enough money from oil, perpetual budget delays, insecurity diverting government attention, debts owed FG, tax evaders especially companies, etc. 
Even if it was, they have done well.
8281 2018-05-18 20:24:05 #wjecchemistry all the tweets are so amazing.
But seriously, why would people be convinced to switch brands of cooking oil?
8282 2018-05-18 20:24:04 I understand how you would get a scant tablespoon of oil. But this recipe is calling for a heaping tablespoon of oil.

This is a dangerous ideology which should be banned. Responsible for trashing the planet everywhere - Ivory, palm oil, Reef bleaching

8287 2018-05-18 20:23:12 Relatively low volatility this week despite rising rates and oil.
For the week:
Dow -.5%
S&P 500 - .5%
NASDAQ -.7%
Russell 1.2% (all-time high)
Oil +.8% (4 year high)
Gold -2.2% (5 mo low)
8288 2018-05-18 20:23:08 Boy. The US loves our guns. Our children feel this domestically as do children in the Middle East where we regularly drone bomb and kill innocent civilians over oil but under guise of protecting them from themselves.   God Bless the US.
8289 2018-05-18 20:23:02 im at the point now where everytime i walk past the fryer i just wanna stick my hand into the hot oil????

8296 2018-05-18 20:21:03 think better explanation for fixed income fall tho is swing in ECB policy and the impact that had on flows.  

Euro area imports of oil fell, but oil exporters cut back brutally & that hit exports so no big impact on corporate income I think.

general equilibrium hard,
8297 2018-05-18 20:20:37 Always a great reporter, even before oil and gas. And a great person, too. Best, Claudia.
8298 2018-05-18 20:20:30 Oil change and full tank of gas....Today been a good day
8299 2018-05-18 20:20:09 “Wait until the oil runs out” is a popular comment on FT.

I wonder if those that say it realise that if global oil reserves run out the whole world economy which is propped up by oil sales, would be in compete tatters, meaning this would effect each an every football club.

8303 2018-05-18 20:19:33 Well, it's all about progressive overload--hung over or otherwise. For anyone in that mid-thirties and beyond club, I'd recommend supplementing fish oil, glucosamine, and magnesium before you start curling a buck 35 for reps--if not, you'll end up having to wrap your elbows.

8312 2018-05-18 20:18:55 i dont disagree, but im just a huge hoe for some soft tortillas fried up in some oil, like some real street taco kind of beat
8313 2018-05-18 20:18:49 I didn’t get a free oil change, but I did get a discount

8329 2018-05-18 20:16:48 @POTUS: "New Iran sanctions will be massive." German DZ Bank to suspend biz w/ Iran. Poland's PGNiG suspends gas project w/ Iran. Macron rules out U.S. trade war. Allianz & Siemens to halt business w/ Iran. Maersk stops shipping to Iran. French oil giant Total stops Iran project.
8330 2018-05-18 20:16:45 It should.

they are doing a world of harm with their snake oil facts.
Even is they are entitled to speech its hurting our overall intelligence.
8331 2018-05-18 20:16:44 It should be the Feds saying they will turn off the money taps.......not Premier Notley turning off the oil. Why make her/ us the bad guy for a Federal issue. #stepupottawa
8332 2018-05-18 20:16:43 Yes but the issue is your bond trade becomes inferior in this scenario as oil adjustment is muted

8344 2018-05-18 20:15:38 Okay, Nigeria is supposed to a "nation", but we haven't the slightest idea what we are supposed doing 10, 20, 40 years down the line.

As long as there's oil money to share we'll have "politics" & "politicians", but when that ends, nobody knows what the point of "Nigeria" will be

8347 2018-05-18 20:15:11 Use baby oil to remove any stubborn old tan... put it on then get a hot bath, use a flannel to rub at the tan, rinse and repeat. Shaving/waxing helps remove it from your legs too. Also, when you get out of the bath a good scrub with your towel. xx
8348 2018-05-18 20:14:58 What about all the dead birds on the Alberta #tarsands tailing ponds? As for job creation, renewables create 5x more than oil and gas. And no, coal is not necessary as as a fuel for renewable energy. #StopKM #Renewables #ParisAgreement #solarpanels #Canada

8415 2018-05-18 20:06:49 Hm, oily skin is tricky. You could try a heavy moisturizer at night or hydrating masks. If you can’t find anything that helps blotting papers will at least get rid of some of the oil throughout the day, and obviously mattifying primers and foundation will help.
8416 2018-05-18 20:06:47 There is a cliché about "smart" people (city dwelling, college degrees etc.) lacking "common sense" or "street smarts" (cannot change the oil in their car). But today's intellectuals (media, academy) don't even participate in the real economy or have children.

8501 2018-05-18 19:54:02 Hot oil ko to frizzy hair 
8502 2018-05-18 19:53:59 That's funny cuz the one Yoruba wedding I went to, there was zeroooo spice in the food. Hella oil tho
8503 2018-05-18 19:53:36 Wow, a bunch of tyrannical, dictatorial, Communist, post-Communist, and Arab-oil-customer countries fearlessly attacked a small country by seeking to shame a democracy that showed support. Are you really on the side of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea?
8504 2018-05-18 19:53:32 Yes. Crude oil price is increasing but still Indian govt. Take too much tax on it. And when the price of cruise oil decreases they don't decrease the price of petrol
8505 2018-05-18 19:53:28 Agreed. Things have to change. I'd like to see @RealErinCruz get elected to start. As well as other conservatives running in CA.
8506 2018-05-18 19:53:25 What do you expect? Your government is bombing seven countries, killing millions a year, all for cheap oil. America's only values come from the end of a loaded weapon!
8507 2018-05-18 19:53:23 Not without some anointing oil and serious spiritual warfare first.
8508 2018-05-18 19:53:22 Depends on the type of deals. Oriental Hotel attracts more Asian businessmen and they generally do more deals here than Europeans and Americans. 

Eko Hotel also attracts a lot of business people, especially those in oil and gas, in my experience.
8509 2018-05-18 19:52:51 Lol that statement is stupid in itself “How do you honor fallen heroes by enriching yourself?”
8510 2018-05-18 19:52:43 #IfImBeingHonestWithMyself My truck really does need an oil change
8511 2018-05-18 19:52:41 “I put keratin oil in my pubes”
8512 2018-05-18 19:52:33 Crude oil prices have shot up from $40 to $70 per barrel due to possible US sanctions against Iran.
8513 2018-05-18 19:52:31 We would like to congratulate Clarence Foster for winning a Roadside Assistance Kit and Stan Gordon for winning a free oil change #Drive4URCommunity #Ford #JacksonFordTV

8515 2018-05-18 19:52:29 Will The United States Offer Total SA Company A Waiver So It Can Continue It's Billion Dollar Contract in #Iran 's Karanj Oil Field ?
8516 2018-05-18 19:52:26 anyway I cant wait to wake up and immediately shove an entire spoon of coconut oil into my mouth and keep it there for 20 minutes
and then continue doing it every single morning
8517 2018-05-18 19:51:57 I saw CBD oil at my vape shop ...I’m curious if I should try it .
8518 2018-05-18 19:51:56  you never put a little oil in a pan and put popcorn seeds in there? What year were you born my love?
8519 2018-05-18 19:51:32 I'll also get the seeds nxt to the oil
8520 2018-05-18 19:51:28 They can't rebuild Syria with the Bully called USA on Syria soil,  if they want that the USA must leave Syria &  Kurds must stop supporting US by allowing them to steal oil from Syria
8521 2018-05-18 19:51:18 And if Wilson follows the same pattern as every other leader on the Cultural Marxist bandwagon, we won't listen to or interact meaningfully with his critics. I suspect that he only sought to throw oil on the flames of the tribal war going on, sadly.
8522 2018-05-18 19:51:13 That and the demonstration on oil of Olay 
8523 2018-05-18 19:51:04 Snake oil sales department.

8525 2018-05-18 19:50:56 the london oil traders are all busy picking out outfits for the wedding tomorrow...lol
8526 2018-05-18 19:50:54 You’d heard about Kirsten right Darcy and wanted to get the hell outta there before the baby oil was busted out 
8527 2018-05-18 19:50:46 Only when America gets a leader who believes in results over profit and will put as much time and effort in renewable energy as it does for coal and oil, will we truly progress responsibly.
8528 2018-05-18 19:50:34 Maybe you should get out of Ontario once in awhile... Nothing wrong with BC or Alberta there's more to both than oil/gas.... What u gotta watch out for no clear winner that's bc/greens holding hostage... Apparently its okay for pipeline to carry fuel to airport from harbour
8529 2018-05-18 19:50:25 Shale has increased production way over 1 mill bpd  in just one year and the price of oil and transportation fuels  soared over 50% despite a worldwide moderate demand growth. Anyone must concede that something big is going on here.
8530 2018-05-18 19:50:23 Bush & Obama's average prices during their two terms was pennies apart. Remember that crisis under Bush where prices went over $4? He put together a group to make sure they weren't gouging us. Came back & said they weren't. Yet oil companies posted highest profits that year. 
8531 2018-05-18 19:50:04 Oh. The one where I was arguing with Ruslan? 

Wawu. You're losing your edge. Come and kneel down, let me anoint your head with oil.
8532 2018-05-18 19:49:51 "No guns, borders, genders, oil or jobs!" 

Isn't a message that will win Texas. 

But have fun with all that.
8533 2018-05-18 19:49:50 Lol so this man comes into the salon trying to cell caster oil. I doh pay him no mind helping my hair dresser prep for my braids and thing
8534 2018-05-18 19:49:46 Z8/z9 crude oil spread has lost -$1.50 while fp only .70 cents from high someone’s selling the z8
8535 2018-05-18 19:49:24 Oh yeah!!! A few years of oil money doesn’t make you a big club. I understand. I always have.
8536 2018-05-18 19:49:20 So Edwin I see that you're looking for the leaders all the time but were you able to figure out ahead of time that it was going to be oil then retail then small caps running?  I guess oil I can see but what about the other two?
8537 2018-05-18 19:49:15 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
8538 2018-05-18 19:49:14 Castor oil. U can put it on your lashes too
8539 2018-05-18 19:49:13 my scalp screaming for some oil , i hate when people do my hair right

On time
8541 2018-05-18 19:48:59 Large Air Force bases and oil pipelines up there. Lots of “us” go up there to work.
8542 2018-05-18 19:48:57 Wish the same thing is done in oil and gas.
8543 2018-05-18 19:48:55 Alh AA Rano* D exceptional oil marketer that owns every terrain of business without banks loans, he owns oil-Money, Oil-tanker, Oil-Farm tanks, More than 2k oil-tanker-Trucks & oil filling stations, Can u present som1 in ur household or village 2 match D young billionaire?
8544 2018-05-18 19:48:42 Why would i ever schedule my oil change so early knowing the DMV closes at 12 on saturdays.  welp 
8545 2018-05-18 19:48:28 Been on pof for a week, and haven’t had a single message I’ve wanted to reply to. The most recent one just said ‘wanna meet up?’ Err, what makes you think we’re a good match buddy? Ffs. I’m no oil painting or anything, but seriously?!
8546 2018-05-18 19:48:24 Aahhhhh! I have coconut oil and completely forgot about it! I’m gonna try sleeping w it in overnight lol
8547 2018-05-18 19:48:13 They were busy teaching us that we were conceived in sin while the other kids were being taught they were created to change the world
Checkout the results yourself

8548 2018-05-18 19:47:52 Try baby oil or lotion
8549 2018-05-18 19:47:38 I thought the duty of vandalism and crude oil theft is for CIVIL DEFENSE CORPS?
8550 2018-05-18 19:47:37 yeah. he swears pure cooking oil and bleeds out grease but i love him
8551 2018-05-18 19:47:36 So my electric is being delivered to @guitarcenter on June 6th. I was anticipating it on the 23rd of this month and then most recently this week. @JacksonGuitars can you please get yourselves together, I want my JS22 Dinky Natural Oil 
8552 2018-05-18 19:47:33 This is so true. The elites always think kids need further indoctrination but when was the last time they changed their own oil or fixed their plumbing or wired their house? Our education system is a mess and is doing our kids a huge disservice.
8553 2018-05-18 19:47:30 Detailed my car & have it smell in bomb, showered w/my new shampoo & conditioner, shaved & lathered myself in coconut oil... best... feeling.. everrr
8554 2018-05-18 19:47:23 Ok good the media must sharpen its pens for another procurement scandal. Oil Refinery Tender Scandal will be the headlines. Unless due diligence is prioritized and blacks are given opportunities not the usual suspects.
8555 2018-05-18 19:47:19 In vita mia...avrò schiacciato solo un punto nero...e mi fece infezione...da quel momento non tocco più  nulla...al max uso tea tree oil puro per accelerare l'assorbimento
8556 2018-05-18 19:47:18 #VoteThemOut2018  Boycotts work. Congress would act if several million students and parents boycotted specific national merchants whose CEO or Board Members support the NRA? We need to get their lobbyists to work for us. NRA lobbyists vs. Oil, Phone industries, etc. lobbyists.
8557 2018-05-18 19:47:13 Very true. Like I said, it will be interesting to see what comes to light as they investigate further.
8558 2018-05-18 19:47:09 Iraq of course,dont you remember the US army guarding the oil fields Saddam failed to burn,,(he knew what we were after),,while the people grabbed what they could from museums etc,

8560 2018-05-18 19:46:49 Yeah.  I’m sure some people like them.  My friend had a 7 series.  There is a gian pan that covers the entire bottom of the engine that needs to be removed for oil changes.  She didn’t know her car was leaking oil (all stuck in the pan) and blew up her engine. :/  sucks
8561 2018-05-18 19:46:49 I knew if I asked the twitterverse someone would know . . . although I remember a time when team accounts would provide the history/story with the picture! :P

8563 2018-05-18 19:46:34 There will always be oil and gas in the energy market share pie. The size of the pieces will change over time.
8564 2018-05-18 19:46:27 Aye y’all I need you to call 209-975-7010 and tell Eyob you hate him. Or tell Hex her thighs are appreciated. Or ask Charles how to create a mimosa. Or ask Jalal for some free beard oil
8565 2018-05-18 19:46:21 Also you can try cooking/olive oil.
8566 2018-05-18 19:46:19 too much lead in your water while growing up, Chuck?  Run out of snake oil to sell and attacking teens instead?
8567 2018-05-18 19:46:19 I purchase a highlighter and I hate it so much its too glittery. Maybe I’ll put it in some baby oil.
8568 2018-05-18 19:46:07 i really miss olive oil ice cream from scoops
8569 2018-05-18 19:46:04 I mean, I use lavender oil, not lotion but lmao
8570 2018-05-18 19:45:44 I use oils as a cleanser. That’s it. Oils most closely mirror human sebum and skin ph. Oils dissolve oil and dirt. I can’t recommend any traditional cleanser since I don’t use them. They’re mostly surfactant based shit anyway.
8571 2018-05-18 19:45:30 well... duh...

this is @realDonaldTrump a door to door snake oil selling charlatan, with a cheap suit and spinning bowtie
8572 2018-05-18 19:45:23 At the #MedicalCannabis clinic #NatureMédic today they asked me the same questions again, to evaluate the differences from before i started using the #cannabis oil & flower. 3 months ago my pain was 7/10 today is 2/10, avg. well-being went from 27% to 80% #MMJ #CannabisMedicinal
8573 2018-05-18 19:45:14 I need an oil change
8574 2018-05-18 19:45:04 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8575 2018-05-18 19:45:04 Hey Jen, great news but 33 years away. How about California mandating solar panels on all new houses starting 2020. Love oil at $80/bbl. With solar panel prices plummeting, economics will prevail unless derailed by ignorant climate change deniers.
Their children will be angry.
8576 2018-05-18 19:45:01 And that's just it. At the time, I was thinking it would make a good story. And it did up until I forgot it.
8577 2018-05-18 19:45:00 Hot oil treatment w the fresh cut have me feel too good!
8578 2018-05-18 19:44:50 We took the babies w/ is to get the oil changed and they got so much love from the employees :)
8579 2018-05-18 19:44:39 First oil this week, then retail, now small caps running...you have to pivot with the market instead of going against it
8580 2018-05-18 19:44:38 Is God's will really murder flooding the streets?
Can we measure her love by the oil underneath?
All I ever wanted was what I was told I was owed
At what cost? I'll never know
8581 2018-05-18 19:44:32 Instagram really knows what I want from my friends. That's right - Essential Oil MLMs!! I can't get enough!!! /s

8584 2018-05-18 19:44:15 Drift away massage oil, they can both enjoy
8585 2018-05-18 19:44:12 After a half-decade of plummeting prices, the oil & gas industry can breathe easy once again as prices begin to rise. While the pressure to drastically reduce costs has eased, the need for cost discipline should not be cast aside.
8586 2018-05-18 19:44:06 LOLOLOOL then bring back the #opec oil embargo... I call your bluff losers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #atheism
8587 2018-05-18 19:43:56 I think I might have stayed there for 10 minutes before getting bored and leaving. But it didn't matter because I know I went there. Even if I didn't remember much, I can still stay I did it. That's worth something.

8589 2018-05-18 19:43:44 Ohk then, have you seen the dollar to rupee rate, when the crude oil price were $ 40 per barrel, our hon. PM said it was because of his luck that the fuel price plunged, wonder what he'll say now, and yes if at that time the prices would have been at around rs. 50 (1/2)
8590 2018-05-18 19:43:40 $SDRL if oil goes up 2% on Monday we will spark another 30% $$$$$
8591 2018-05-18 19:43:36 getting the oil changed in my car never fails to make me feel like the dumbest person on earth because to every question they ask me all i can answer is “uhh i’m not sure” or “uh i think...”

8595 2018-05-18 19:42:57 Subsidy was removed due lower international oil prices but loot is started because people didn't got that low price benefits as Govt increased taxes in fuel and that's the loot
8596 2018-05-18 19:42:51 Obaseki said that the state was developing robust forestry management structures to ensure that the state’s biodiversity is conserved even as oil palm plantations expand their operations.
8597 2018-05-18 19:42:49 Oil dealing should dump the dollar and use yuan as a currency of choice after all the dollar is not backed with anything apart from the massive Chinese debt? In that way the dollar will sink Trump to the shithole he possesses
8598 2018-05-18 19:42:45 First of all, it's not my country for me to do something about it. Second of all, it's what the president should do. It says a lot about the president when his priorities is talking about oil when another one those school shootings has been committed.
8599 2018-05-18 19:42:40 Lol ok for about 8 cups of rice I first blended one tomato, some chopped onion and a red bell pepper. Heat up a good amount of oil and fry some onion before putting your blend in. Letting that cook down for about 10 minutes and then add in two cans of tomato paste
8600 2018-05-18 19:42:39 Oil markets benefiting from Venezuela meltdown and its oil supply destruction, oilfield supply shortages, and decline in oil inventories. As rare it is, OPEC & Russian discipline is helping too.
8601 2018-05-18 19:42:36 According to him, “We have provided the enabling environment for the expansion of oil palm plantations in the state. This was done in line with extant international regulations on plantation agriculture. This is for the benefit of the people of Edo State.”

.
8602 2018-05-18 19:42:35 I think removal of guns will promptly start an armed riot, and then "all the lunatics kills eachother". After that, peace and acceptance will prevail. 2nd amandment should have been removed the day USA found oil.
8603 2018-05-18 19:42:22 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
8604 2018-05-18 19:42:21 We also have: No oil changes, no fluid replacements (besides washer fluid), no belts, chains, or hoses to wear out & replace… 

Not sure on this one, I think EVs have the edge. Especially the more affordable Model 3.
8605 2018-05-18 19:42:11 I'd love to help you with that coconut oil!
8606 2018-05-18 19:42:05 this humidity got my face on OIL SLICK, okay? it needs to go away.
8607 2018-05-18 19:41:56 I think the Oil are going to have a bounce-back year, but... “final four” is perhaps a little too optimistic.
8608 2018-05-18 19:41:45 I'm reminded of that scene from Steve Martin's "The Jerk" when someone is trying to shoot him but missed and hits oil cans instead.
8609 2018-05-18 19:41:38 Do these women know your boss wants to build a climate-destroying pipeline? And that he's offered to indemnify a Texas oil company with public money if there are political delays?
8610 2018-05-18 19:41:21 : . . . two stubborn/spoiled ppl don't mix  like oil and water
8611 2018-05-18 19:41:21 Just slathered masel in baby oil feel lit Kim K standing waiting on ma bath who wants pumped x
8612 2018-05-18 19:41:09 It's not our fault the president isn't doing the right thing. You know what he's doing? he's planning to talk about how oil should be improved or whatever, that says a lot about him as a president. We stood up for our rights as young people, we spoke up, Trump just didn't listen.
8613 2018-05-18 19:41:01 @NRA @PsychToday @YalePsych @HarvardHealth Terrible news from TX 1 day away from FE. Secret Police caused? Auto gun ctrl demands? @infowars @RealAlexJones @POTUS @BarackObama @FBI @UNPOL Influence of the Mind, retaliation ideation, Oil and EVs, #ClimateChange, any clues? #2ndA
8614 2018-05-18 19:40:56 Exactly. Not only gun laws but there are so many laws on the books I can guarantee you from the time you wake up in the morning until the time you go to bed at night you broke at least one law. So therefore  none of us are truly law-abiding.

8617 2018-05-18 19:40:26 Every classroom must maintain a vat of boiling oil at all times.
8618 2018-05-18 19:40:17 I ain’t talkin bout lean but I’m sellin that oil! 


8619 2018-05-18 19:40:15 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
8620 2018-05-18 19:40:10 Family Nutrition: Cheez Whiz Cheese Dip this May? Its top four ingredients are whey, milk, canola oil and maltodextrin.
8621 2018-05-18 19:39:57 Hairy folks that don't shave: What body lotion are you using? Looking for something oil based that doesn't turn all the hair white, slick and sticky, that also doesn't cost $$$$$$$
8622 2018-05-18 19:39:53 I know its a stretch......a long stretch but its what needs to be done. We are eventually going to have to move from oil anyways, sooner than we think.
8623 2018-05-18 19:39:48 That @nytimes brillant takedown of misogynist snake oil salesman Jordan Peterson is spot on. Show it to your buddies who keep saying he's a genius.
8624 2018-05-18 19:39:46 The fact the average voter thinks our State oil company should be privatized is a good indicator of how far the Overton window shifted. But it's still a long term trend. We won't have ancapistan in the next 5 years. But I'm optimistic (I'm young anyway)
8625 2018-05-18 19:39:35 It's just a thin fillet. I seared it in olive oil & lemon juice. Then sprinkled smoked paprika,  cracked pepper and pink Himalayan salt.
8626 2018-05-18 19:39:24 Instead of having to cover the royal wedding, I just proofed a column from our Ask a Stoner about masturbating with CBD oil. #localjournalismmatters #savelocaljournalism
8627 2018-05-18 19:39:09 Good grief, those comments. The only worry I have here is she might get some oil on that nice white dress.
8628 2018-05-18 19:39:07 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
8629 2018-05-18 19:38:59 Exactly... Puppets of BIG OIL.
8630 2018-05-18 19:38:49 And I'm pretty sure I stalked the hell out of her facebook at the time. But that's how ideas are sometimes. The idea of a person is more attractive, more memorable than the person themselves. Experiences can be the same way. In college, I was stoked to see the Grand Canyon.
8631 2018-05-18 19:38:45 SPF 50 or canola oil ? Asking for a friend
8632 2018-05-18 19:38:39 It is not me sir. When I saw it, I immediately thought about those ewa agunyin you and aunty @BukkyShonibare showed on tweeter. And knowing Dr was a Malabite, Mama Put soup is always palm oil, water, nfi and paper, I thought I should alert you all to the new health risk ni sir.
8633 2018-05-18 19:38:33 STATOIL. Sounds like state oil and its giving Scotland ideas.

8635 2018-05-18 19:38:22 Status update : currently star fished on my bed absolutely covered in baby oil cause apparently it takes fake tan off ???? Wild Friday !
8636 2018-05-18 19:38:20 Yea, I just mean the temporary dye doesn't get stripped out using this method and these products. I think being free of sulfates and the coconut oil bases really helps.
8637 2018-05-18 19:38:19 Wait, CoD isn't the same?
8638 2018-05-18 19:38:12 no poster paint is babby paint so it comes off
oil paint just dries and reminds you of the mistakes youve done
8639 2018-05-18 19:37:51 Our global economy has been based on Oil & Perpetual War since 1880. 
But sure, go ahead and tackle the psychology of the Military Industrial Complex. JFK addressed it and that didn't work out so well. Hey look. Oil skyrocketing on a total glut. crazy, neh?
8640 2018-05-18 19:37:47 I went to get an oil change, but instead, they backed my car into an SUV. 
8641 2018-05-18 19:37:45 おやすみ！！！
8642 2018-05-18 19:37:45 Someone said it'll burn my skin. Plus do they actually sell the oil?
8643 2018-05-18 19:37:39 @JohnnyNoblebody I'm intrigued by your discussions with @Mangan150 about skin care, for men specifically. What do you recommend for a cleanser for men, beyond your face oil (I assume)? Any guidance is appreciated.
8644 2018-05-18 19:37:39 Avocado oil is the best for high heat cooking.  I'd stick with the avocado oil. : )
8645 2018-05-18 19:37:22 in need of: a pool, margaritas, tanning oil, good vibes, & my man 
8646 2018-05-18 19:37:19 Low oil prices have a direct impact on the energy industry. High extraction costs and low prices are the issue.
8647 2018-05-18 19:36:56 Have fun!  Buuuuttttttttt........before you leave, can I ask a question?  Is coconut oil as safe and stable to use for stir fry as avocado oil?
8648 2018-05-18 19:36:56 I mean alcohol is a culture.
Same way food is a culture.
Like if I bring up olive oil
Spaghetti, and wine. Do you not know exactly what group of people I'm talking about
8649 2018-05-18 19:36:50 In fact the feeling that it was important is something that I remember more than any actual aspect of our relationship. Conceptually, meeting someone on the road is romantic. It sure felt like it. And yet without the help of Facebook, I can't even remember what she looked like.

Small bundle of fresh parsley or 2 table spoons dry
Ground pepper

Add olive oil last and mix well
8653 2018-05-18 19:36:05 Real threat. It’s like walking at the edge of a vulcano right now but #oil portfolio is 20% plus.
8654 2018-05-18 19:35:57 I’m trying to wrap my mind around this & it just wants to !  This guy @EricGreitens is looking worse than a  Oil Salesman after fooling the people & now messing with the people who should be protecting the laws & it’s people!!!  Am I getting this right?
8655 2018-05-18 19:35:51 Tick tock Putin's closing in on complete occupation of Syria, Assad will be Putins stooge, Putin wants a Russian solid base and Assad's capitulated for Putin to rule Syria, he wants the Oil, he wants M E launching pad for missiles to fire on democratic countries opposed to him
8656 2018-05-18 19:35:41 I drove out to the canyon, baby
And hit the motherfucking road
I paid my fine and all the lights
Look exactly like a picture show
The desert skies before my eyes
They turned into a sea
A flaming mass of oil and gas
Screams with ecstasy
8657 2018-05-18 19:35:27 My "harsh" shampoo that I use once a week has coconut oil in it too, and I do a coconut oil mask the night before I'm going to shampoo to help protect the shaft even more, and then do my expensive hair mask as conditioner on that day.

8660 2018-05-18 19:35:07 $oil No one can absolutely control the price of oil, silver, gold, and other commodities used & produced all over the world. To some extent yes absolutely no. Supply & Demand has a big influence finally. 
8661 2018-05-18 19:35:03 Kid with a bad home-life, that's bullied at school, sees all the attention others get. It's a way to reach out to get attention.

8663 2018-05-18 19:34:50 Leased airframes get table scraps for maintenance. Don’t know if true, but I read awhile ago various US carriers fly theirs to China for “change the oil” maintenance. Maybe all of it 
8664 2018-05-18 19:34:44 The thing I hate the most about taking fish oil is that it always feels like I just finished deep throating Nemo whenever I burp

8670 2018-05-18 19:33:32 Damn...@TheGrazingShed have destroyed the #argiebargie. No chimichurri sauce, just oil.
8671 2018-05-18 19:33:23  .....too much oil in the egusi soup. That's gonna clog  the arterial walls leading  to atherosclerosis reducing blood flow to d heart and can cause cardiac wahala. Lol
8672 2018-05-18 19:33:19 Ese si es macro de a devis.  Su ratio contra el $OIL anda besando apenas x encima la mediana de ciclo largo (7 años).  Ya andamos viendo IMO otra guerra de comodities energeticos (industrialización) vs la maquinaria de derivados contractuales de los globalistas.
8673 2018-05-18 19:33:19 I think we hung out a total of 4 times after that party. One time we went to a coffee shop. We hung out in her dorm roon a couple other times, and then that sleep over. It felt important but again, 5 years later my only recollections are like fractured photographs.
8674 2018-05-18 19:33:03 2/2 They're only paying for a small tax increase. So Venezuela isn't really relevant when it comes to seeing and how it works, because they relied on the capital of their oil. They had socialist ideals, but relied on a capitalist market.
8675 2018-05-18 19:33:00 Just read the news now, that’s so messed up, there are too many idiots and too many guns in the world
8676 2018-05-18 19:32:38 having a car is convenient, but gas, oil changes, car washes, payments & insurance ain’t convenient for my budget

8679 2018-05-18 19:32:28 Stupid people have been around forever, but what's astounding is that they are proud of their ignorance and happy to be led by the oil lobby. They don't want to see the conflict of interest.
The Republicans go one better, they take money for being stupid and band together. 
Vote.
8680 2018-05-18 19:32:26 Well,oil isn't illegal and is often a natural resource which the constitution places under the exclusive reserve of the fed govt,weed on d oda hand is illegal nd often grown,that's mostly y if found in Ur backyard u'd hav committed a crime!

8684 2018-05-18 19:31:51 5/ And while NK is potentially terrifying, the Iran situation is an *actual*, ongoing regional clusterfuck.  We just gave the hardliners and the RG a gift wrapped present, right as we moved our embassy to Jerusalem, Jesus Christ.  An oil spike hurts us and *helps Putin.*  Fuck.
8685 2018-05-18 19:31:41 Ameen Ya Rabb
8686 2018-05-18 19:31:39 They relied on oil where most countries that favor socialism don't. Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland. Places like that don't rely on their oil for cash. And actually having universal healthcare would let people keep more money since they're not paying premiums and 1/2
8687 2018-05-18 19:31:19 Thing is if he’s one of the bad apples who’s going want him also he’s about as mobile as a fuckin oil tanker

8690 2018-05-18 19:30:41 And yet thos time limit makes them seem all the more important, all the more intense. After they are over, they feel important even though in the moment you were perfectly aware that everything that happened existed under the notion that this is never going to happen again.
8691 2018-05-18 19:30:37 Very misleading if you look at global stratagy of  putting pressure on the Russian natural gas industry. Working to replace Russian oil company customers with crude shipment of non Russian ownership. Arming anti Russian Ukraine arming Baltic republics arming Poland Romania etc

8715 2018-05-18 19:28:21 Palm oil...That was actually the first and last
8716 2018-05-18 19:28:19 Relationships with time limits are strange things. You know they're short term and you know they're more or less disposable. You do not belong here. Sooner or later it'll be time to go again so getting attached makes no sense. All parties involved know this.

8724 2018-05-18 19:27:12 Who wants to smoke while my car gets her oil change?
8725 2018-05-18 19:27:09 She wants to try homeopathy and trusts the local herbal pharmacists. She has found a bunch of roots and spices and super foods, and we have been experimenting with #CBD oil. She won't even take anything for pain. Very stubborn but totally respectable.

8741 2018-05-18 19:25:01 Neumarket $NEU is one of those companies that crushes, but about which nobody talks.  They make additives for lubricants like transmission fluid and engine oil.  Last 10 years through April, it has compounded >22% year, or more than 4.5x the S&P 500 (long $NEU).

The oil companies, operators and such should definitely be held accountable for not monitoring/ catching leaks soon enough. Ive cleaned a spill before, certainly not what I want.
8767 2018-05-18 19:22:15 "I was trading an asymmetrical spread in oil."

Can anyone with a CFA please tell me what that is?
8768 2018-05-18 19:22:02 WHY is it that every time I get my oil changed they want to find SOMETHING wrong with my car ?!?!
8769 2018-05-18 19:21:58 I was just here last weekend. I feel you girl. If there’s anything I can do to help let me know. I fully depend on hearing pads baths and cbd oil haha.
8770 2018-05-18 19:21:51 Bets on if David Hogg shows up?
8771 2018-05-18 19:21:50 Many of the laws are designed as revenue streams, rather than actually reducing or preventing crime.
8772 2018-05-18 19:21:48 Hair cut, oil change, highway.. in that order early in the a.m.
8773 2018-05-18 19:21:33 Put that silver tongued fork back in our mouth now Donnie.....You've dribbled enough 'snake oil' for one day don't ya think??
8774 2018-05-18 19:21:30 “What about the working class”?

“That’s basically who socialism is for”

“Hard pass. Let’s bend over backwards to make sure the shareholders of a large Texas oil company get to be billionaires”
8775 2018-05-18 19:21:25 I brought my car to get an oil change and the  mechanic tryna holla. Um sir, go back to work and fix my car
8776 2018-05-18 19:21:24 Yeah I have an argan oil mask I'm gonna do twice a week and I have olaplex too, nunca puedo ser feliz siempre me pasa una mamada 
8777 2018-05-18 19:21:21 And unfortunately the only thing that is giving the dollar any value is the fact that oil is still traded in US dollars. Regardless, if any civil war or any other catastrophic event would take place, I would still not leave the US.
8778 2018-05-18 19:21:19 Good grief. Russians were monitoring Hillary's server for years.
8779 2018-05-18 19:21:09 If they remade #Fantasticvoyage now and #Trump was the patient, the entire movie would consist of the crew having to swim through tons of horseshit and fucking crude oil.
8780 2018-05-18 19:21:06 Some ginger syrup, advocado oil, chillie flakes, this lil hot sauce shaped like a skull. I want to put my menses blood in it when I finish it. There were hot sauce kits I wanted so bad. But I could only walk with so much.
8781 2018-05-18 19:20:39 Get off my screen, Ted! You sound like a snake oil salesman plying your shitty "thoughts and prayers"
8782 2018-05-18 19:20:17 I got oil thrown in my face today
8783 2018-05-18 19:20:16 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
8784 2018-05-18 19:20:10 More than 5,000 Yemeni children have been killed or injured with OUR BOMBS since a Saudi-led coalition entered the conflict in March 2015 - and you want to school us on human rights? Your CIA director is a poster child for what American really values: cheap oil!
8785 2018-05-18 19:19:57 Not an AR. A shotgun and pistol. So there goes the theory of "assault rifle" ban being effective. 
He also was not a very good bomb builder
8786 2018-05-18 19:19:57 if i used oil paint the white stains wouldnt fuck off
but fortunately im using poster paints
8787 2018-05-18 19:19:52 One other thing, it is foreseeable that oil prices will rise because there just is no other real alternative to fossil fuels
8788 2018-05-18 19:19:41 Nancy, please stop stating that the NRA “owns” Congress. You sound like a simpleton. What about big drug companies, oil companies, media companies, manufacturing companies, food companies, etc. The NRA isn’t the problem. Mental health and the government not following up is broken
8789 2018-05-18 19:19:37 It doesn't look like a Green parking lot, parking lot made from gravel soaked with heavy oil, real thick dirty stuff
8790 2018-05-18 19:19:27 The shawarma I just bought and tried to eat.... 

It's like they used mayonnaise, added sardine, and groundnut oil. Terrible! 

Tuah! Mistake! mistake!!

#ThrowAway.
8791 2018-05-18 19:19:19 The frozen assets are what the other countries are paying for, aka forced oil deals. The US sent $400 million to Iran at the time of the last released captive.
8792 2018-05-18 19:19:12 Give up already. You wouldn't be relevant if it were not for Arab oil money sugar daddies
8793 2018-05-18 19:19:10 Classy Restaurant menu: *hand battered ricotta cheese farmed from locally sourced award winning dairy farms and slow fried in fresh oil and new born tears*
... it's a fucking fried cheese stick JUST CALL IT A FRIED CHEESE STICK
8794 2018-05-18 19:19:10 all my friends left dallas already and i’m stuck waiting at firestone for 2 hours to get an oil change 
8795 2018-05-18 19:18:59 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
8796 2018-05-18 19:18:49 We would fish a creek with m80s.
8797 2018-05-18 19:18:48 I'm not one for conspiracy theories. I'd have to see evidence of that.
8798 2018-05-18 19:18:39 Merci pour l invitation @TPMasenko
8799 2018-05-18 19:18:34 Same prices as in 2014.  Oil prices and refinery maintenance same reasons.  BTW why does Sask have highest prices if they have no carbon tax?
8800 2018-05-18 19:18:29 He is being bought off by lobbying of oil computer and the Koch Brothers...
8801 2018-05-18 19:18:21 We had BB gun wars in the riverbed!

8804 2018-05-18 19:18:07 Olive oil, Jojoba oil, i wear wigs and I condition a lot
8805 2018-05-18 19:17:43 Yup. Another kid with a low quality home life, that snapped after being bullied at school.
8806 2018-05-18 19:17:40 Nymex wti crude oil sell call pft till now $71.37 to $71.20 pft $00.17  point mean 1 lot pft 170 U.S  Dollars
8807 2018-05-18 19:17:36 But, he’s correct. Under Harper, 2 new pipelines were approved & built: non-XL version of Keystone completed in 2010; & Alberta Clipper, active in 2010. The changeover in Line 9 taking oil west/east was also approved. In total, an additional 1.25-million barrels a day were added.
8808 2018-05-18 19:17:34 Market Close: Oil Futures Settle with Selling Spree in Diesel, RBOB, Brent #OOTT
8809 2018-05-18 19:17:26 What do you mean, Tom? The House investigation just wrapped up their report saying she sold all our uranium PLUS our strategic oil reserves. HC is obviously a traitor as they’ve been saying for 30 yrs. Thanks Nunes! The idiots are finally vindicated.
8810 2018-05-18 19:17:20 Don't let the pastor spray that anointing oil on your wall . It's very hard to get it out of the wall #TheQueenMzansi
8811 2018-05-18 19:17:19 Just seems counterintuitive. While I get the outlet theory, it normalizes extreme and odd behavior. We didn't have that outlet and managed a bit better than the kids today.
8812 2018-05-18 19:17:11 @SOPHIEMSMSMSM release oil of every pearl’s un-insides
8813 2018-05-18 19:16:56 Black oil/ink attack is invention of BJP only. Now getting taste of their own medicine.
8814 2018-05-18 19:16:48 You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.

PSALM 45:7
8815 2018-05-18 19:16:42 si! Y existía una marca que se llamaba Éfesis. Y los Motor Oil estaban también.
8816 2018-05-18 19:16:37 How many have died in car crashes or drug overdoses? A gal jumped off a building with her child. Ban tall buildings?
8817 2018-05-18 19:16:32 I add to the oil any time I fry.

And, the question was about foil.
Any thoughts?
8818 2018-05-18 19:16:20 Witaj :) słucham 2 części II RP !!!
8819 2018-05-18 19:16:20 Nymex Settles 5/18/18 - CL Jun18: 71.28 (-0.21) (+0.8% vs Last Week) #nymex #wti #oil
8820 2018-05-18 19:16:14 try black castor oil. I went natural in 2 years without chopping and did a snip at the very end of the process
8821 2018-05-18 19:16:07 Together, we can save American lives, American jobs, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
8822 2018-05-18 19:15:50 I'm attempting to make Dave a caprese burger for dinner.  Do I make a basil/olive oil "pesto" for it or just go fresh basil w/ balsamic reduction?
8823 2018-05-18 19:15:41 I mean... I work in a company that provides services to oil companies and the idea of leaks is always treated as a "when" rather than an "if". But also, see every oil spill ever for examples of when leaks have happened despite the engineering that goes into preventing them.
8824 2018-05-18 19:15:22 Getting my oil changed and the tv is just news about the fucking school shooting this morning and I am so sick. How many times does this have to happen before you wrinkly old fucks stop insisting you have a right to own guns? This kid took his dad's guns and killed 10 people. Wtf
8825 2018-05-18 19:15:09 This is the WWI version of the PPCLI cap badge so yes.
8826 2018-05-18 19:15:07 Saw a stripper in there get a lad on stage, stripped him to boxers, wrapped him in clingfilm, put baby oil on him, then made it look like she was going to wank him off, put her hands in, cut his pubes off & stuck them to his top lip like a moustache
8827 2018-05-18 19:14:30 Due to transportation issues, Penn Farm/ Norma's Produce will not be at  Arlington Mill Farmers Market tomorrow. But Spartan Oil starts tomorrow!
8828 2018-05-18 19:14:30 like canola oil?
8829 2018-05-18 19:14:25 My truck will be getting a driver monday meaning I've got to let it go that I already know a company can't leave it sit that long we have had many a good mile and hope it finds its way back to shop to be fixed it needs oil leaks fixed bad I've been trying to get it ready asap
8830 2018-05-18 19:14:10 Subsidy junkies who’ll support any snake oil salesman promising the sun and stars
8831 2018-05-18 19:14:08 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
8832 2018-05-18 19:14:00 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
8833 2018-05-18 19:13:57 Rising oil prices are a feast for me.
8834 2018-05-18 19:13:52 In my early 20s I was a beach lifeguard for six years and we worshiped the sun, even using baby oil and iodine to get a better tan. Today, I visit the dermatologist every six months as a result of my exposure. If we only knew!
8835 2018-05-18 19:13:41 Why does getting an oil change always turn into a $100+ dollar thing???? This is why I put it off for months
8836 2018-05-18 19:13:35 Exterminate
8837 2018-05-18 19:13:07 Like what Alberta is thinking of doing to BC with oil.
8838 2018-05-18 19:12:50 I've always believed that a felony should have to be a pre mediated, violent or blue collar crime. You should never be able to accidentally commit a felony.
8839 2018-05-18 19:12:16 I definitely need an oil change now.
8840 2018-05-18 19:11:59 Oil com wanachakachua mzee nshaweka buku 30 mshale haukucheza wala hakikupanda kitu tuliwawakia kinoma

8843 2018-05-18 19:11:47 Excited cause this local artist with a great beard purchased some of my beard oil and loves it!
8844 2018-05-18 19:11:44 Motor oil doesn’t hurt my stomach as much as keystone does
8845 2018-05-18 19:11:41 Nuts! and shmancy pumpkin seed oil! And cheese and lamb hearts and the good sardines for me, and avocados and berries and gallons of nut milk for him. I'm still often startled at how cheap we're eating.
8846 2018-05-18 19:11:40 yeah but chris coconut oil i mean come on
8847 2018-05-18 19:11:40 America's #1 export is war - killing for cheap oil. Is there any wonder that there's no value for human lives?

8849 2018-05-18 19:11:21 Bout to go to the car wash & get an oil change
8850 2018-05-18 19:11:04 So @VinnieTortorich traveling in Italy I realized that the bottle of olive oil they put on my table IS NOT for filling my water glass. Who knew? #NSNG
8851 2018-05-18 19:11:02 Try garlic or coconut oil!
8852 2018-05-18 19:10:57 FLASH: Following an injunction granted by Justice M.S. Hassan of the Federal High Court, AMCON has taken over Sea Petroleum Oil & Gas Ltd. and other assets belonging to Senator Stella Oduah-Ogiemwonyi over an unpaid debt of about N20 billion.

8855 2018-05-18 19:10:35 Pepboys u can get deal with coupon for synthetic for like $60 , synthetic way more expensive than conventional, usually runs $80-$100 on oil change alone

8857 2018-05-18 19:10:20 Abortion is not medical care Chuck. You know damn well what fungible means. 
PP can change. Get out of abortion business.
8858 2018-05-18 19:10:18 It was when @TheDemocrats held the Presidency and both chambers too. Maybe if our Government didn't sanction killing for cheap oil, our value for human life might change.

8864 2018-05-18 19:08:51 Sitting at Honda waiting for oil change and some older woman is watching a video with "all the single ladies" playing. I'm ok with her not using headphones

8866 2018-05-18 19:08:46 Always, old oil tends to alter the flavour profile of what you cook with it due to the way it chemically alters
8867 2018-05-18 19:08:19 WTF has fossil fuels got to do with Israel during the last 70 years? We only discovered gas here about 5 years ago. No oil.  You just don't see that the reason the West supports Israel ( although not in UN votes) is because they don't agree with your narrative. You are wrong.
8868 2018-05-18 19:08:19 We need to ask if there is some desperate panic on the realization that the entire oil sands industry will collapse, and Alberta and Canada for seven generations and more might be left with the massive cysts and polluted tailings ponds we caused Mother Earth.
8869 2018-05-18 19:08:01 Helena just accused an oil rig of being a nuclear power plant
8870 2018-05-18 19:07:53 Well my first thought was that you should fuck off forever, but after giving it some consideration, what I'm hearing is we shouldn't threaten the environmental wellbeing of an entire province for the sake of enriching the shareholders in a large oil company to which I agree.
8871 2018-05-18 19:07:53 And gas prices going up are taking it out of our pockets. Is there anything you can do to bring them back down?  Do we not have enough oil here to off set what is shipped in or is it just plane o.o greed.
8872 2018-05-18 19:07:51 The eco style black castor and flaxseed oil gel works extremely well with my hair. I love it!
8873 2018-05-18 19:07:36 I still have it in the fridge! In a few days I'm going out to buy transparent jars so that I have a better gauge of when the oil has spread, but I haven't opened it or anything yet.

8882 2018-05-18 19:05:38 This one was USPS... The infamous OIL SOAKED PACKAGE from earlier in the week was UPS.  I think they all hate me!
8883 2018-05-18 19:05:35 That these are plants. For a 17yo to have all those items...seems there had to be help, someone trying to further an agenda...making sure all types of guns are present...in a TX school, it's all very convenient for those who want to see the abolishment of the 2A.

8885 2018-05-18 19:05:25 If Gulf Economies go down in future, due to shift to renewables or exhaustion of oil resource, Kerala will come down to the level of West Bengal. 
They have chased away all the Industrialist from that state.
8886 2018-05-18 19:05:13 I think they need to diversify their economy instead of making the whole country depend on the oil they have to make money, very resource rich place but not economically efficient
8887 2018-05-18 19:05:05 Greed, price fixing. Greed by foreign owned big oil that have no feelings for Canadians. Market collusion!

8891 2018-05-18 19:04:56 Jamie Oliver just drizzles olive oil all over his food , that’s just about it .
8892 2018-05-18 19:04:52 Hello fellow stretched ears fam, jojoba oil is a gift from God herself
8893 2018-05-18 19:04:46 India seems to be the interesting exception to this pressure though oil trend is definitely concerning for them on external side and perhaps on fiscal if they cut the tax. Of course India looks much better on St Fx liabilities and inflation side than it did in 2013 or past crises
8894 2018-05-18 19:04:34 vape oil. Please I must see
8895 2018-05-18 19:04:27 Who sells Transmission oil here I need one for my car.. I also need transport for a mission to transmit the transmission sorry I mean apprehension no concotion
8896 2018-05-18 19:04:19 It’s a little hard to explain. I’ll probably get jumped on for this , but simply the middle has the most money ( oil , farm land, economic,dairy ) the outside has the most beauty. And everyone resends everyone else for what they have.  Lol any response?
8897 2018-05-18 19:04:19 7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
8898 2018-05-18 19:04:19 I agree. Rig at Lidsey is there to improve flow rates imo. Then on to Balcombe .Bet Angus have oga approval already. And if SCC ever want to have a say in oil again ..Will approve Brockham post haste! Then rig to Brockham. Timings are right!
8899 2018-05-18 19:04:10 It's just called rapeseed oil in the uk surprisingly.
8900 2018-05-18 19:03:58 Not through Culver City please!!! So 16 people get to wait/ride a skate that only stops at LAX & DT? Or Valley & LAX?  On how many EQ faults & oil fracking sites?  Build 1st then study? We are not fools. Stick to the skies & Tesla 3.
8901 2018-05-18 19:03:52 The left ain't doing so well in any of these areas either. It's not a right or left thing. It's a human thing.
8902 2018-05-18 19:03:47 The gun plus yet another white thug, who yesterday was "A law abiding citizen". DUUUUUH. Time serious vet white thugs who play with their gun oil lube.
8903 2018-05-18 19:03:43 I am guessing that is a historic version of the PPCLI insignia? I just ask as it is different from the current insignia which the Pats pay homage to by wearing on the shoulders of their regular jerseys.

8905 2018-05-18 19:03:33 Why ain’t nobody tell me tea tree oil smelled like dirty basement before I put this shit on my face
8906 2018-05-18 19:03:31 Just because you keep saying something doesn't mean it true. Refineries have been built to accomodate heavier grades of oil as light oil discoveries have been diminished over time. Heavy oil is in demand, regardless of your sad attempts to make things up.
8907 2018-05-18 19:03:23 Yes you DO know. Unless you have the intellectual capacity of a cesspit, you really do know. Children have been murdered. @RealAlexJones shyster couldn’t give a flying one so long as he shifts more snake oil to paranoid, sick twats like you

8909 2018-05-18 19:03:00 Great review! Glad to hear that Edd is enjoying our Barberclub Long beard & Skin Oil.
8910 2018-05-18 19:02:58 Really? This is what drives it? You do realize that humans are the ones making decisions and pulling triggers right? So if all the oil and gas dried up, we would all kiss and make up? Because a lack of oil didn’t stop us from killing each other for you know, thousands of years..
8911 2018-05-18 19:02:50 My visit to Iran in 2017 made me hopeful, and I still hope for changes giving young people more freedom and choices. It is a great country and US has since 1954 made many mistakes. Its not about oil or religion, its about the new generation.
8912 2018-05-18 19:02:48 who wants to kick it with me instead of edc? i’ve got a dank soundcloud playlist and cannabis oil.... who’s down?
8913 2018-05-18 19:02:46 This castor oil has been working wonders for my face
8914 2018-05-18 19:02:42 another thing is that i always assumed "grapeseed oil" was just us trying to avoid saying "rapeseed" but they are in fact very different things and grapeseed oil is actually just made from grape seeds 
8915 2018-05-18 19:02:18 North & West TX: If needed, spray roses with an organic fungicide such as neem oil to control black spot and powdery mildew.
8916 2018-05-18 19:02:15 Interesting.  It will be very interesting to see what is found out...seems that once the actual truth starts coming out...the story dies down. I just hope we don't get another Hogg from this.
8917 2018-05-18 19:02:15 Campbell soup says Trump tariffs hurting profits but no problem Trump gave middle class families huge tax cuts with their GOPTAXSCAM so they will be raising prices like Big Oil because Trump promised them and Big Oil huge profits for campaign contributions
8918 2018-05-18 19:02:13 my phone won’t read my fingerprint bc I have so much tanning oil on....it’s fine.
8919 2018-05-18 19:02:13 Today was one of the worst days at school. People throwing water balloons the whole lunch period. But along with water was oil, hair removal cream, milk, and eggs. People are crazy these days.
8920 2018-05-18 19:02:05 @carlquintanilla burning the mid-afternoon oil
8921 2018-05-18 19:01:56 I have a feeling a lot of Libyan oil sales are discrete, given security issues with the civil war etc.
8922 2018-05-18 19:01:56 Reserves are necessary to build am independent currency: oil, gas, Gold, assets, stock, Land, etc. A comodity money.  In Time, the scots pound Will become a Fiat money...
8923 2018-05-18 19:01:40 Almond oil 
8924 2018-05-18 19:01:25 but that;s assuming oil sales via EU Member State central banks would suffice to appease Iran. That is unlikely. They want a real economy

8928 2018-05-18 19:01:14 Interesting, rote answer. Interesting in that snake oil Ted, omitted, “Thoughts.”  Sometimes, the most telling language is what was omitted, eh?
8929 2018-05-18 19:01:10 Cooking oil on tomorrrow for some serious sunbathing 
8930 2018-05-18 19:01:05 That old oil pipeline in the Straits of Mackinac that must be removed, and the Nestle Corp. don't help to keep Michigan Pure. You're right that our Great Lakes are important to Michigan.
8931 2018-05-18 19:01:04 You think prayer with anointing oil is free?
8932 2018-05-18 19:01:02 Yet we have 0% in our foreign reserve under Jonathan watch, which was oil price in global markets was $140 per barrel...
8933 2018-05-18 19:00:53 Indeed, the truth shall prevail.
8934 2018-05-18 19:00:52 Here by way of a rogue @SLAhq mention - I'm a Librarian and currently work at an oil and gas company.  We're everywhere! #IAmALibrarian
8935 2018-05-18 19:00:49 IEA Warns Global Oil Demand May Suffer As Crude Nears $80
8936 2018-05-18 19:00:34 I got a free oil change today

Tomato, basil, olive oil and garlic, grilled ciabatta
8940 2018-05-18 18:59:58 India is freaking out about rising oil prices
8941 2018-05-18 18:59:56 I wondered what the person that discovered yam was looking for. I can imagine the conversation in his head went like...

"Oh! See this stalk. I'll just dig to find out what it is"

"Oh! See this big tuber. I'll just cook"

"Oh! I wonder what it tastes like"

"Oh! Red Oil"
8942 2018-05-18 18:59:56 @kimkomando You might want to think about pushing Tribo_Tex for cars.  The science behind it doesn't match. If so good why are they advertising themselves? NASA involved? Really where is the big company that backs this.  Many experts say PURE SNAKE OIL.  Rip off.  Beware suckers
8943 2018-05-18 18:59:51 Very boring…Basically indices, rates, gold, oil…all basically FLAT..zzzzz
8944 2018-05-18 18:59:50 Which tends to pour over into school, sadly.
8945 2018-05-18 18:59:42 They can say all they want but Allah is the protector of his Dean.
8946 2018-05-18 18:59:40 What are you suggesting?
8947 2018-05-18 18:59:38 The fact that you would trust me around boiling hot oil proves that we don't know each other well enough in the Real World™
8948 2018-05-18 18:59:29 Dammit I thought that was my take....quit saying things first
8949 2018-05-18 18:59:25 Unlike leftie socialists I have no master and don't want one. I'm not begging for someone to run my life for me. Gov will dissapoint quicker

8952 2018-05-18 18:59:14 @elonmusk you should sell snake oil next. One that actually works
8953 2018-05-18 18:59:13 The oil companies were making money before the oil crisis and would have continued to even with federal price ceilings in place during the crisis.  The GoA restricting production and export killed the oil development.

8955 2018-05-18 18:59:02 There's a reason that 90% of Manhattanites didn't vote for him. He's a con man. Snake Oil Salesman. Want to be his lawyer and get stiffed? Personal responsibility, indeed.
8956 2018-05-18 18:58:57 The consensus is that the US economy is robust and won't be in recession until 2019 even 2020. The combined effect of sharp rising oil, dollar and interest rates may trigger a recession before end of year.
8957 2018-05-18 18:58:55 From the description of the kid, I'd say he had a bad home life.
8958 2018-05-18 18:58:50 oil paint is so frustrating i wanna cry
8959 2018-05-18 18:58:49 Good lord they are taking forever to change my oil
8960 2018-05-18 18:58:43 I seriously don't know what their problem is. You "hardly" see a good Muslim attacking other religion but every Tom, Dick and Harry wants to have a say in Islam while they don't know shit!

8965 2018-05-18 18:58:01 He announces 200 jobs and no doubt CBC will be giving him a medal for that. If he were to only support our oil industry, there would be tens of  thousands of jobs.

8967 2018-05-18 18:57:56 The same oil and gas Tory said was finished in 2014, and a burden on Scotland,  yet here it is at $80 A barrel and rising,  Tory are finished, nothing liars ,racists, and only here to stitch Scotland up
8968 2018-05-18 18:57:47 Oil production in Venezuela has dropped way off.  It's at pathetic levels, when they should be ramping it up.  
They always subsidize oil for Cuba, Nicaragua, etc., but not enough now for that. They buy outside oil to give to Cuba!

The era of thinking the readers are all fools has long gone. Any news outlets still live in last century will be dumped sooner or later.
8973 2018-05-18 18:57:03 Because outside of our own echo chamber, no one calls then on it. 
If you see 5,000 tweets condemning false CNN bs, it represents 4,999 conservatives. 
There is no downside to them
8974 2018-05-18 18:57:03 I did drop the plug in the oil pan but that's it.

Yes I hate people who ride bullet on footpath.
There's a special place in boiling oil for those people who ride bullet on footpath
8980 2018-05-18 18:56:46 They be trying to find a way to make a nigga spend some money cause that oil change free 
8981 2018-05-18 18:56:41 There's great Australian mainstream music: Paul Kelly, Eskimo Joe, Midnight Oil, John Butler Trio, etc, etc.

8983 2018-05-18 18:56:26 Nishikori hasn't exactly had a healthy campaign himself but it's nice to actually see Novak Djokovic compete against a quality opponent and come out on top. Let's hope this is the first step in getting back to where he was prior to the injury bug hitting.
8984 2018-05-18 18:56:25 Mine will lick countertops for bacon splatters, lap up olive oil, coconut oil, bacon fat in ANY pan, get into the trash (we have a dog lock on it now) and now the garbage disposal. AND he's the thin one.

8986 2018-05-18 18:56:09 I feel sorry for the mechanic that has to change that car's menstrual oil.

Mike Pence and I would give you whatever you want on climate ch, oil wars & death penalty, if you would save God's babies.
I'll become far left fascists country as much as I hate it if y'all never kill one of these babies in the womb ever again
8990 2018-05-18 18:55:43 That coconut oil be something serious 
8991 2018-05-18 18:55:38 Well if the oil is $150 at least, for $350 you aren't getting completely ripped off, considering shop supply will have a markup and labour is around $140/hr.
8992 2018-05-18 18:55:31 Not coconut/shea butters. Oil for the body that are scented. I'm gonna check them both. Thanks ma.
8993 2018-05-18 18:55:06 Car insurance insurance phone bill gas food brakes oil change more food car wash help with rent bitch where is me
8994 2018-05-18 18:54:58 So if you have two family members each making $40,000, that is a total of $80,000 which is pretty good. North Dakota is a boom state with recent shale oil discovered up in the northern portion. People need to get off public assistance, train and work. There is work if U want it.

8997 2018-05-18 18:54:37 So are his parents.
8998 2018-05-18 18:54:37 I know already. This kid was known. Ppl had an idea he was off. His outward obsessions on FB ECT are indicators, more ppl will confirm
8999 2018-05-18 18:54:33 Ok Trump it is not fake news that the Big oil companies are ripping us off at the pumps it's time you do something about it.
9000 2018-05-18 18:54:26 Just a reminder for myself to avoid con men and snake oil salesmen.
9001 2018-05-18 18:54:25 it stops the oil splitting...for a country famed for understatement his "madness" reaction was a bit OTT.

Also, out of all the helpful stuff I put on Instagram, that's the one time the guy engages? 
9002 2018-05-18 18:54:07 Lmfao I told you there was lil kids at the oil change place
9003 2018-05-18 18:54:03 Son they gotta get this oil shit under control. $40 to fill up is noooootttttt what I’m tryna be doin tbh

9006 2018-05-18 18:53:23 Yup. I spent many happy hours helping Dad work on the car...changing oil, tires, & wash & wax. He taught me how to drive a stick too.
9007 2018-05-18 18:53:17 @realDonaldTrump there's this country that is falling apart. The citizens are killing each other all the time. Kids are being killed. You really should show the might of the good ol' US of A by bombing them and taking their oil to teach them a lesson. The country is America btw
9008 2018-05-18 18:53:01 As if we the proud muslims of India waiting for your greetings. Oil your own machine. Your sahab has greeted in Urdu. 4 saal baad ab votw ki bari he na. Shame on people like you. Sudhar jao warna...
9009 2018-05-18 18:52:57 But easy as f to make
9010 2018-05-18 18:52:42 Perhaps u r havng the syndrome of mal observation & non observation as yr views on current  state of Indian economy is far off d reality. GST collection of more than one lakh crore is just tip of d iceberg.   Crude oil output gets fixed by  OPEC to maximise profit.
9011 2018-05-18 18:52:37 If you get an oil change or anything done they call like three times text you email you etc lol
9012 2018-05-18 18:52:35 @business @markets @HaidiLun : Tell #CarlosTrevino that some inexplicable event is happening with oil demand. These prices aren't justified!
9013 2018-05-18 18:52:29 I be thinking coconut oil & vitamin E oil is the answer to everything lmao
9014 2018-05-18 18:52:28 Because 80% of the public won't question them on it.
9015 2018-05-18 18:52:26 We have been full time since Dec 2016.  Just like your home, it is always something!  But we have the best backyard anyone could possibly ask for, and when we get the itch for a new view, we are off!!!  My husband is a farmer/oil worker, retired, he takes good care of us!

9018 2018-05-18 18:52:19 Ooooo Liz never do what they tell you at a place like tireplus or jiffey lube. Find what’s wrong when they tell you and you take it too a mechanic smaller one. I had them trying to charge me 740+ for oil leak on top gasket took it to a small mechanic and paid 240 with extra work

9022 2018-05-18 18:51:45 I just did my oil change 3 weeks ago, already put 3000 more miles on it.
9023 2018-05-18 18:51:36 This is a true. Everyone wants to buy, very few legit sellers that can show POC. Funds are diversifying their portfolio into Bitcoin, just like gold, oil, or real estate.

9025 2018-05-18 18:51:33 Dammit. Cast is going to be an hour late. I know, I know. It was late yesterday, too. I have to go get my oil changed for my upcoming trip to Denver, and I forgot.

9026 2018-05-18 18:51:27 That PennGrade commercial that plays on the #indy500 live stream is really weird. Is it about spending time with your dog? Tractor pulls? Living in a van? Being from California? Motor oil?
9027 2018-05-18 18:51:24 I put my bowl away for my oil change and the kid gets in to move my car and just gives me a smirk 
9028 2018-05-18 18:51:18 Today, a Christian woman dropped a cartoon in front of the house, it contained food stuff, dried fish, oil and so many other things that i cannot mention. She said it was for Ramadan, i tried to pay her and she returned my money to me.

9030 2018-05-18 18:51:15 Thats when the CNY oil future contract's first front month is reached: so from then on oil will start to really physically move and be paid for in yuan.
9031 2018-05-18 18:51:04 Well, this time should be fun for the gun control folks. they have a semi-auto, a shotgun, and a handgun to target. How in the world this kid got three guns and explosives in a school unnoticed is beyond me. The officials there are idiots.

9040 2018-05-18 18:50:09 When you go get an oil change and tell them to let me know if there is anything else that needs to be fixed and they say your car is running like it’s brand new >>>>

9044 2018-05-18 18:49:58 Have you ever wondered what might have happened had Koch not helped Stalin and Hitler build oil refineries for their war effort?  The Koch philosophy  would have you believe that greed is good, money equals morality and selfishness is a virtue (per Ayn Rand's Objectivism)

9053 2018-05-18 18:49:08 It probably was in her head. And everywhere else. Yes that's what I meant.
9054 2018-05-18 18:49:02 just the oil will be $150 or so, plus the escape has a felt under belly which makes the ice stick like Velcro

I'm going to do my own when the ice build up is gone :)
9055 2018-05-18 18:48:56 This is very likely.
9056 2018-05-18 18:48:56 Today I did a full lube-job on Dogmobile2: Engine, gearbox, transfer-box, front- and read-differentials.

The 25-litres of used oil I now have will be mixed with Creosote (yes I still have access to the proper stuff) and used to treat gateposts and fences against fungi/woodworm.
9057 2018-05-18 18:48:48 Yeah, this is brutal. Oil especially sucks.
9058 2018-05-18 18:48:41 MOISTURE. Deep conditioner, beard oil, drinking water. Also, sulfate-free shampoo. I also hear that combing helps bc it redistributes the oil produced by your skin to protect the hair (but combs are incompatible with curly hair so I don't do that myself)
9059 2018-05-18 18:48:38 Higher Commodities price is because USD is Dropping even Fed is increasing Rate. S&P500 and Commodities will fly. Shipping Rate will fly. Oil demand is Stable. In order to increase Deman they need to give to each China Man and East Indian Man high quality living standards.
9060 2018-05-18 18:48:36 How about the social justice cause in SA that promotes killing White Farmers in the name of equality? I say that warps minds

9062 2018-05-18 18:47:26 If not another crystal shop I got to is Namaste on 14&5th. There's another one in the area but I would go to namaste first. SPECIFICALLY OILS though, gotta go to Harlem. 125 & Fredrick Douglas. In front a the Popeyes there's a guy Idiamin .. he has every oil you can think of
9063 2018-05-18 18:47:18 Damn, came out good! Is it oil?

9065 2018-05-18 18:47:10 That's one of the reasons to torpedo the Iran deal, no Iran oil in market, prices go up, Koch Bros win, plus Boeing deal scrapped & Russia sells them jets instead....follow the $

9075 2018-05-18 18:45:46 อืม โอเคร...
9076 2018-05-18 18:45:44 ...NPA, FIRS and other Agencies were even mentioned in the report. So why narrow it down to "the Nation's apex oil industry" alone?
9077 2018-05-18 18:45:40 China Has Decided Russia Is Too Risky an Investment

The economics of a major oil deal seemed to make sense. But when energy companies are arms of the state, economics aren't the only factor.

Wake up and smell coffee China, Russia is no one friend!

9096 2018-05-18 18:43:27 Verily, a worse tragedy than the Hindenburg.  Didn’t we just fight 3 or 4 oil wars (I lost count) so that SUVs would never ever have to wait for anything?

9105 2018-05-18 18:42:51 Sitting eating dinner with my parents and my mum blurts out she thinks weed should be legalised. My dad agrees. Naturally I do too. They then show me a cupboard in the kitchen full of hemp powder, tea, oil, etc. Was full on expecting a baggie to drop out but it didn’t.

9109 2018-05-18 18:42:30 Maybe how it trades, but there’s also a story of markets looking at a history of strong $, weak global demand, low commodity price correlations and extrapolating that into a US-origin positive supply shock, strong $, weak oil story & getting overbearish in early 2016.
9110 2018-05-18 18:42:18 Mayo is easy. Just add tiny amounts of oil at a time and whisk really well.

The acid attacks or the 600 beat to death with hammers yearly? You won't hear of them
9127 2018-05-18 18:40:44 Because North Korea doesn't have oil, trashing it won't assist Putin in raising oil prices.

9129 2018-05-18 18:40:16 The oil company name is SPG.

SPG is a dead company for over 5yrs now. Guess AMCON is taking over remnants/shafts of SPG. 

This won't affect Stella Odua basically.

9132 2018-05-18 18:39:49 @JustinTrudeau so we need to practice more acceptance and respect to make this world a better place, except when it's regarding the environmental impact of further oil exploration and #kindermorgan #TransMountain pipeline and @bcndp. Listen to your own words
9133 2018-05-18 18:39:48 @DaveyHamilton Thank you, for spending a great time with me and our customers during the race at Indy. Royal Oil had a great time and they are very welcome to you and your team.

9140 2018-05-18 18:39:13 Not at all. It doesn’t contain THC so there are no psychoactive effects. I take oil straight from a tincture, and it’s mixed with coconut oil so it barely has a taste. My favorite is from @thoughtcloudcbd. Give it a try!!
9141 2018-05-18 18:39:08 But for how long did people think they were going to get forty dollar oil? It was a freak created by the banking system lending copious amounts to fracking which then overproduced followed by a global slowdown...not happen again..doubt it.

9148 2018-05-18 18:38:07 But yeah professional oil and frizz treatments are heavenly, I've been doing it for a couple years now, I've actually saved money on hair products doing it.

9156 2018-05-18 18:36:58 Great perspective on the "bully" rationale of big oil.
9157 2018-05-18 18:36:57 If the Government finds oil in your backyard It's government property, but if they find Weed, It's yours and you're going to jail..

Life is not fair at all 
9158 2018-05-18 18:36:50 No argument with me on this, go ahead and share. If we can get better sewage as well as prevent a catastrophic oil spill, all the better. I bet you’re about to post about coal coming out of Vancouver. Great to see we’re making an environmentalist out of you!

9176 2018-05-18 18:35:02 The problem with McDonald’s fries is that they are only good when they are straight up fresh from the cooking oil. With every passing second out of the oil, they get exponentially worse. Wait too long and they are hands down the worst fries in the industry.

9189 2018-05-18 18:33:58 I took the case off my iPhone and sure it feels like it’s about to slip out of my hand faster than a bar of wet soap that’s been dipped in oil but I also feel more glamorous??? Like a +35% boost in mood.
9190 2018-05-18 18:33:57 Everyone's very judgy about Russ, but how do you know he's aware of the "affair", it could be all in her head, but then that doesn't explain the jacket ... #thearchers

9192 2018-05-18 18:33:52 The oil that you pray over is just as anointed as the guy on TV or the internet that wants to send you his anointing oil after you send him an offering! #stop
9193 2018-05-18 18:33:48 He owns like a oil mining company and has some good investments , shocking I know
9194 2018-05-18 18:33:44 We have become immune to the fact that taxpayers protect oil so Tycoons get richer, so now we get to protect real estate moguls too. Don't worry if we can't afford it we will cut social programs and taxes for the rich so the peons lives will be too desperate to complain.
9195 2018-05-18 18:33:42 And Kenya will have its own oil barons, dollar billionaire sheikhs!!
9196 2018-05-18 18:33:25 yea I’ve been washing my hair bc I want to do something different. Deep conditioner & coconut oil are great and help keep my hair soft!!
9197 2018-05-18 18:33:25 #Goldman Sachs warns that investors are getting complacent about commodities and could miss out on rare gains fueled by rising #oil prices.
9198 2018-05-18 18:33:06 I think the return for one barrel of oil invested is around 20 barrels of oil extracted. So 20:1. So you do the math, probably a huge number that will keep on increasing as the oil gets harder to find.

9219 2018-05-18 18:30:39 People ask me often, "If you're lactose intolerant why do you keep eating dairy?" Well because my lunch was a plain grilled chicken breast atop plain olive oil drizzled gluten free noodles. Without the side of white cheddar, there is no love in life.
9220 2018-05-18 18:30:37 We do it here in California for all sorts of electronics, motor oil, tires, hell even soda cans. It's normal, no reason not to for solar panels.

While some companies like #airlines may trade 09/18 or 10/18 #WTI contracts to hedge the potential oil prices hike, the bulk of #US #Oil trading is of the front month. #Reuters has mixed up the trading activities and continued its hyping of #Iran fears.
9235 2018-05-18 18:28:13 I can't wait to get home to put a hot oil treatment in my hair and a deep condition it's gone feel so bomb .
9236 2018-05-18 18:28:11 Modern day Middle East -- and ensuing problems -- was created by Britain in early 20th century (Israel mid-century). BP and Arab oil ring a bell? Your gal Theresa supports bombing Syria. Talk to China and former colony India about pollution, aka "climate change."
9237 2018-05-18 18:28:03 unpopular opinion but I’m tired of seeing people blend liquid highlight all over their face before foundation... I mean go off but some of y’all be looking like oil wells

9240 2018-05-18 18:27:39 Stop your country from killing thousands of children in third world countries with impunity every year for the sake of cheap oil. The USA doesn't value human life - simple cause and effect! What do you except to happen?

9244 2018-05-18 18:26:29 Porque você torce no lugar de investir. Te vejo há tempo falando da Cessão. Inflação americana subindo, Oil subindo, yields subindo, USD disparando. Candidatos com chance: Bolsonaro, Marina e Ciro. Quem acha que é bolsa pra cima não deveria nem ter cheque de banco
9245 2018-05-18 18:26:18 Without oil there’d be no tweeting either
9246 2018-05-18 18:26:17 I miss NY! I really miss pizza that folds in the middle that drips all that orange oil... I think I just depressed myself... I love Cali now, but they still can’t make pizza like NYC
9247 2018-05-18 18:26:14 So here’s what you got me thinking about. Still need to think of a name for the class, but they come with vials of some sort of oil that is very receptive to holding Aetherea.

- They cast spells of “linear” AoE by splashing it out. 
- Aetherea Gasbombs, builds up Contamination.
9248 2018-05-18 18:26:08 guess i’ll get my oil changed this weekend. i dislike being an adult SOMETIMES.

Make peace with each other

9257 2018-05-18 18:24:56 At least they won’t be getting anything from govt as they’ll extract oil from coal, like Sasol of South Africa is doing, at their own cost, I sincerely hope
9258 2018-05-18 18:24:54 So according to u can we expect decrease in oil prices?

9265 2018-05-18 18:23:47 Both are interest groups pushing CON Party propaganda thru a compliant media. Simple as that. Oddly Connies scream 'socialist liberals and their special interests!' while Connies themselves are beholden to the largest special interest of all; Big Oil- which funds Fraser #cdnpoli

9272 2018-05-18 18:23:00 While our Prime Moron is busy playing devious games, to snatch power in yet another state by hook or crook, the rupee is on a free fall, banks are on a meltdown, price of crude oil is rocketing, jobs are being lost, companies are closing down, poor are starving & India is crying.
9273 2018-05-18 18:22:57 Not interested in cause. My theory is all this social justice crap pervasive in society, schools in particular is warping minds.
9274 2018-05-18 18:22:55 Or peppermint oil.

9310 2018-05-18 18:18:37 Huge environmental risks? 50million barrels of oil are transported by tanker every day. Where are all these environmental disasters?  It's funny how the people shouting the loudest are often the least informed.
9311 2018-05-18 18:18:29 Oil prices dropped under Obama because our production increased domestically.

9316 2018-05-18 18:17:59 I bealive you know that high Oil prices are creating huge expenses for Marine transportation. Some Ships have around 60 tonnes Heavy Oil consumption per day.

9324 2018-05-18 18:17:03 It is a cause for anguish that his message seems to resonate with so many people. But that doesn’t change the fact that what he’s selling is snake oil in a Jungian-McCarthyite bottle.

9328 2018-05-18 18:16:38 the world if it means getting richer himself. So, what happens in Israel, Iran, and the rest of the middle east does affect our oil prices somewhat, we could take protective measures to lower prices for consumers, but won't because of profits.
9329 2018-05-18 18:16:35 Solid lies there. A less than 2% increase in tanker traffic will threaten the orcas? How about theassive increases in coal shipments out of Vancouver? Phantom markets? Where does all that Alaska heavy crude go? Look at an IEA projection of world oil demand.
9330 2018-05-18 18:16:32 Thank god you're here!!
9331 2018-05-18 18:16:28 It isn’t. It is oil rich.
9332 2018-05-18 18:16:19 It seems the NRA is thinking like the arsonist: saying that fire needs more oil and gasoline
9333 2018-05-18 18:16:10 Almost took the wrong car to go get an oil change bc smart af.

Oil on Water.
9341 2018-05-18 18:15:28 No, it's going to higher gas and oil prices. Just wish once someone in this administration could tell the truth.
9342 2018-05-18 18:15:12 oil x
9343 2018-05-18 18:15:10 worldwide, which is what Russia wants, because 60% of their economy is related to oil prices.  Long story short, we are being affected because Russia needs a stronger economy and higher oil prices help that, and we have a Russian stooge as our leader who will destabilize...
9344 2018-05-18 18:15:02 Jobs never lacked under obama in the oil industry.    I’ve worked in it for 15 years.   Was a strong last 8 years
9345 2018-05-18 18:15:00 Like, you want to try and climb that oil waterfall? It’s unambiguously there. The game doesn’t draw that inference, but the alternate you draw is immediately contradicted by the text above.
9346 2018-05-18 18:14:44 That, and every single TV program is violent, glorifying the misuse of firearms. Every criminal has a mac10 and all the police are discharging full autos in response on crowded streets.

9348 2018-05-18 18:14:38 20million ,Range Rover, G-wagon,oil and gas.Sorry oo,but this were all I saw in that story. Aunty your man was sincere and clean,forgive,forget and am sure he won't hide stuff from you again . Meanwhile that 20million divide it by 20 and gimme if you don't want bikonu.
9349 2018-05-18 18:14:14 Get this oil cum bucket off my feed.
9350 2018-05-18 18:14:04 Lmaooo my friend gone say during his wreck it was like baby oil was on his tires.  idk why but that shit has me dead 
9351 2018-05-18 18:13:54 Cars are also expensive. Got my battery replaced yesterday, need an oil change and tire rotation. Oh BOY. I AM BROKE. I GET IT.
9352 2018-05-18 18:13:47 Gas prices rise because of overall control of supply. If oil and gas execs wanted to lower price, they would increase supply. The middle east hasn't affected American oil prices majorly since the 1980's. There is, of course the global supply, that will be affected, raising prices
9353 2018-05-18 18:13:45 I can’t wait to get married, so my husband can take my car to get oil changes, and new tires and all that car stuff 
9354 2018-05-18 18:13:44 thats it? There dangerous? Ha Ha oh you are one of the pro oil guys.
I'll be sure to run away if I see one.
9355 2018-05-18 18:13:35 Yeah, too much oil in that egusi

9362 2018-05-18 18:12:34 For every 300 barrels of oil that is produced in a day, 1 of those barrels is used on a @united jet.  - Scott Kirby, United President #GlobalHouston
9363 2018-05-18 18:12:31 so untrue. Europe has an obscene level of obesity. Where did that come from, palm oil?. The list of illness troubling the west despite the advancement in medicine, will shock you. 90% of Western foods are clued from elsewhere, so No!!! food is not why they are developed pls
9364 2018-05-18 18:12:30 Oil isn't going away soon, but we shouldn't increase the capacity, move to decrease.  Increased use of solar and wind can generate power to replace home heating fuels, the question would then be do you want clean air and water or oil?
9365 2018-05-18 18:12:29 Didn’t the US “liberate” Libya because Ghadaffi was going to move away from the $USD for trading his oil? Regime change to keep the US economy propped up?

9373 2018-05-18 18:11:09 My point is that US policy under Trump has taken a sharp turn towards policies that benefit Russia. Another example is pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal which is driving up the price of oil which benefits Russia again.
9374 2018-05-18 18:11:07 You’re probably right. Anyway, this is #thearchers & between Jazzer & Soozan, Lizzard will find out. #thearchers
9375 2018-05-18 18:11:04 Bombers from the 60’s with the radar cross section of an oil tanker. A couple fisherman in a raft with a MANPAD should be a sufficient defense against them.
9376 2018-05-18 18:10:56 Kanchanada, is this guy the scholar whose books we mugged up all these years??!!!! Like seriously all these years we were gorging on rubbish burning midnight oil???!!

9397 2018-05-18 18:08:48 Sounds like a commercial. My view is be very careful what you put in your body and don't trust snake oil salesmen.
9398 2018-05-18 18:08:40 Go to @Walmart for an oil change, there’s ONE car in the garage, none waiting and the associate tells me it’s going to be an hour wait! Yup, it’s time for me to get my own tools to do this in 1/4 the time.
9399 2018-05-18 18:08:36 What the fuck does that have to do with Turkey? We get most of our oil from domestic sources or Mexico and Venezuela.

9413 2018-05-18 18:07:18 I agree. I said that because he and his crooks have dismantled so much. Much more than we know about, I'm sure.  It will take a long time to reconstruct what they have destroyed. If he doesn't get out of there soon, we may have oil rigs in what used to be a national park.
9414 2018-05-18 18:07:14 I don’t think I follow why $1 a ride is impossible, but even just taking rich people off the road would mean less traffic for everyone, especially since we’re talking West LA
9415 2018-05-18 18:07:13 US, what controlls oil trade has set up sanctions and crisis destructed Venezuella's economy. It's a very simple. Any country what tried to be independent from US feels colossal pressure, faces coup and wars.
9416 2018-05-18 18:06:59 Of course, I've been angry in my life, never thought once about pulling out the 12ga and going after anyone. But you and I are obviously mentally stable. It's just bizarre.
9417 2018-05-18 18:06:42 Given what we know exploiting the tar sands is a crime pure and simple.
At best, it's an unbelievably bad gamble.

9425 2018-05-18 18:05:49 I hope tons of blunts are involved tonight, luckily for now I have an oil pen. 
9426 2018-05-18 18:05:47 We definitely have to secure our borders. But with OPEC raising oil prices, and Iran exporting heroin, they’ll always have funds. Pre nuclear deal they were only able to sell 1 million barrels a day. Under the agreement 2.5 million. We pulled out but the deal still stands.
9427 2018-05-18 18:05:28 Olive oil smells ridiculously good
9428 2018-05-18 18:05:21 I don’t see this as a problem or scandal at all. You’re a sleazy snake oil salesman.
9429 2018-05-18 18:05:12 Hell no to offshore drilling. Have these morons learnt nothing from the B.P. oil spill? They must dream about drilling every night. For those who care about the planet the very idea is a nightmare.

9432 2018-05-18 18:05:05 *IF* only we had continued on the smart path of purchasing the hedge at low price ($30-$50) we wouldn’t be concerned.  We would be making money now.  We continue to shoot ourselves in the foot.  It was inevitable oil price would rise.

9458 2018-05-18 18:02:18 Nothing wrong with oil and gas or supporting the industry that Canada has both the resources and expertise to market. As well as the laws that protect both the people who work here and the environment we all live in.
What's wrong is their fixation on controlling others' rights.
9459 2018-05-18 18:02:15 That $1/ride is where this breaks down. What he’s really selling is public transit for the wealthy. My guess is $1/ride will be accompanied by a high annual subscription fee to avoid bottlenecks and funding problems.
But hey there’s also the “drill faster AND cheaper lol!”
9460 2018-05-18 18:02:03 Yes ma’am! I use African black soap paste (Amazon) like 2-3 times a week. Bioré cleansing scrub 2-3 times a week. Neutrogena deep cleansing face wash every day. Tea tree oil face wash 1-2 times a week. MOISTURIZE DAILY and drink hella water.
9461 2018-05-18 18:01:56 Hi Sonia, is it motor oil from a SEPTA vehicle? Also is it the stop for the 48 on Arch or for the 32 on 18? ^NV
9462 2018-05-18 18:01:52 I have no desire to reveal any info like that,  the press will eventually make that moot however.

9468 2018-05-18 18:01:17 My point is, oil isn't going anyway. In time it won't be used so much for fuel. But the mfg process will be around for decades or longer.
9469 2018-05-18 18:01:17 The safest, most efficient way to get oil to the coast is by pipeline, not rail or truck

9499 2018-05-18 17:58:32 putting coconut oil in your hair before you braid it is a must
9500 2018-05-18 17:58:28 Yep - they are most impressive with oil on that - sad thing the market is so forgetful and devoid of opinion they forget - works a treat for them

Oil is what we've got, and there is nothing else like it!
9512 2018-05-18 17:57:37 It's because of #reliance .... #jio loss s compensated with oil price....
9513 2018-05-18 17:57:34 Before Trump, Russia was on the verge of economic collapse.  Now, oil prices are back up and Russia is making major inroads on soy beans and other commodities.  #MAGA 
9514 2018-05-18 17:57:28 Alexa thinks mayo is a vegetable..... her debate is that the first ingredient  is soy bean oil. Please help me out....

9516 2018-05-18 17:57:21 today is the day. It starts right now. I stopped with traders way for a few reasons.  One is 10-45 second delays on orders. One is they close at 4 pm on a friday rather than 5 pm and I HATE that !  also hate Gold and oil only accept trades at .10 so good bye to them!

Alive! When our mother earth is dying, people have nothing  good to believe in. Donald your thoughts and prayers are  corrupt w/ greed.
9520 2018-05-18 17:56:45 Exactly why we need all the tools we can get in treated chronic pain. Pain meds (opioids) are one of the few things that help me, even if only a small degree. I have no access to MJ but it helps but illegal. CBD oil does nothing. We are all unique in what works and what doesn't.

9526 2018-05-18 17:56:20 Sir, oil and starch in Africa is pure. Anything imported is not pure. Forget the grammar on the label.
African food is good for the body. Ask Anthony Joshua.
They should not enslave us in food again. Please
9527 2018-05-18 17:56:08 I still use my beard oil that I used to sell... I put on the second one called Hollywood and damn does it same delicious
9528 2018-05-18 17:56:03 Fun Fact: In 1992, Mueller oversaw the conviction of John Gotti, the crime boss of the Gambino family. Twenty years later in 2012, Gotti's daughter, Victoria, was a contestant on The Apprentice. Small world (neat). And those racist  Trumpsters love their gun oil lube.
9529 2018-05-18 17:56:01 What utter rubbish. We also saw oil price drop dismissed as scaremongering. Remember that? Now snp shouting about leaving EU as bad for Scot - scaremongering. Rank snp hypocrisy. Again. Anyway the loss of 500000 votes shows what Scots think of them.
9530 2018-05-18 17:55:55 Social engineering gone bad. Obsession with teaching social justice causes overloads some. They don't know what to believe in. Lost souls.

9533 2018-05-18 17:55:28 @CourtneyYounggg Yeesh! Did you get the oil changed yet?
9534 2018-05-18 17:55:24 True, but it was during the Oil Crisis in the Seventies, if I’m not wrong. Now (I hate this sentence but...) the time is different.
9535 2018-05-18 17:55:17 Fresh mozzarella, sun-ripened tomatoes, basil and olive oil is a foundation of Italian cooking. #radkecf
9536 2018-05-18 17:55:17 I like this tactic and I think it will be effective but how does the provincial government stop the flow of oil? Do they have authority over midstreamers to redirect oil? Will there be enough capacity for redirected oil in other constrained networks?
9537 2018-05-18 17:55:12 @CarMax I brought my less than 6 month old bought from y’all truck to get oil change, add Freon.Instead I got oil change and ac diagnosis. I will not get service from y’all again,nor will I purchase a $17,000 truck with no ac from y’all again.
9538 2018-05-18 17:55:05 US drillers added 1 rig to the number of oil and gas rigs this week, according to Baker Hughes, with oil rigs holding steady and gas rigs adding one. The oil and gas rig count now stands at 1,046—up 145 from this time last year.
9539 2018-05-18 17:54:54 How about we stop spending BILLIONS of dollars on foreign aid to nations like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.. and use that money for universal healthcare that includes MENTAL HEALTH Care. How about we stop subsidizing the OIL industry with billions of dollars in tax breaks and heal.
9540 2018-05-18 17:54:51 bay area peeps, PLEASE spread the word about OIL. it seems like the community there hasn't been tuned into the previous discussions about how terrible it is. i really really don't want anyone to get hurt or arrested.

9547 2018-05-18 17:53:45 Way back when I was first learning to cook I would use spray oil in the pans & one time I decided to re-coat the pan w/ the fire underneath it & I did that flame shooting shit. My momma beat my ass sooo bad. 

I don’t know how this is relevant but I wanted to share the memory
9548 2018-05-18 17:53:34 Dangit! All my lotions at home have some sort of scent. I'll def keep this in mind for when we have more time to run out to the store. In the meantime, I think coconut oil will have to make due. I think that's ok. >_>
9549 2018-05-18 17:53:34 Assos after shave GT45 snot / sweat and warm up oil.
9550 2018-05-18 17:53:27 I just scrubbed my toilets with baking soda, vinegar and lemon essential oil and I put lavender essential oil in my toilet tanks so now I really feel like I’m going places.
9551 2018-05-18 17:53:25 You likely have a stronger concentration sweat glands on your right armpit than your left. That's normal. Some of the curry flavour gets absorbed into the oil you cook it with. Some of that oil gets absorbed by your body and is then sweated out and clings on your skin like a balm
9552 2018-05-18 17:53:24 風が強すぎる
9553 2018-05-18 17:53:23 well maybe slash the subsidies that the government gives to oil companies and give the residents the subsidies. Just a thought because any other plan makes more money for oil companies.
9554 2018-05-18 17:53:21 great point.
9555 2018-05-18 17:53:17 Tea tree oil! But make sure to dilute it
9556 2018-05-18 17:53:07 Why don’t you start dealing with the issues here instead of poking around in other nations?  Oh I’m sorry three letters describe it - OIL
9557 2018-05-18 17:52:55 I have seen people make it with turkey and even vegan bacon. I personally used olive oil mayo and unsweetened peanut butter but I don’t think minor changes would ruin it at all.
9558 2018-05-18 17:52:54 I just put coconut oil on my sunburn (for the first time) and I’m so sticky and I’m gonna vomit. Why’d I do this to myself when I know I have SPD

9560 2018-05-18 17:52:31 I think the body needs every food but we just have to eat everything in moderation. 

No carbs. No carbs. Did you know there is a problem if there’s too much protein in your body? 

No oil. No oil. Do you want your skin to dry out? Lol woah 

I’ll eat. Just in moderation.

9591 2018-05-18 17:49:22 So, do we conclude that the wars in the Middle East beefed up by Trump and UK Gov among others, are raising the price of oil and gas and making US and UK shale gas industry look profitable and necessary?????,

We don't trust the ones making a mockery of constitutional posts to do the same.
Coffee is on us.

9605 2018-05-18 17:47:59 yup!! its gentle on the bum, and areas around  as its all natural. coconut oil is amazing for skin, heals very nice.
9606 2018-05-18 17:47:30 OIL has not directly addressed any of these concerns, only vague tweeted about haters. there is a reason they're moving to SF - everyone in vegas and LA already knows its bad news.
9607 2018-05-18 17:47:19 But what does Nkosikhona actually mean?

Maybe we are banging our heads when the answer is right there before us.

But, eish, this 'mega deal' smells so suspiciously like those tales you associate more with snake oil salesmen and not with a whole govt.

9612 2018-05-18 17:46:35 The N62 engine has a known issue with a gasket located behind the alternator bracket. This seals a hole in the block, placed there God knows why, past which high-pressure oil flows. It's like a $5 flimsy rubber part that requires 10 hours of labor to replace.

9622 2018-05-18 17:45:23 Completely agree. You only have to look at the Cowleys at Lincoln to understand there is some real untapped talent out there. McLaren is nothing but a snake oil salesman
9623 2018-05-18 17:45:22 for sauces you want to use olive if possible, has a much better flavour profile w pasta and is good for frying at low heats. sunflower oil is much more suited to high temps and in larger quantities
9624 2018-05-18 17:45:22 Some where i read that oil contributes only 6% in Dubai's GDP rest they generate from business and tourism. And people over there have 100 times better life than India
9625 2018-05-18 17:45:06 I got a car oil diffuser,  but I only put lemon oil in it so my car smells like a lemon drop at all times
9626 2018-05-18 17:45:03 Use coconut oil for a mouthwash before brushing your teeth in the morning everyday, swish it around for like 15-20 mins, it pulls all the "toxins" or whatever out and all the stuff floss and brushing misses.
9627 2018-05-18 17:45:00 Garlic, ginger, 5-spice with oil, add one pkg tofu and soy sauce (or oyster sauce), add whole pkg of bacon (chopped). Mix. When bacon nearly done, add bagged veggies (corn/peas/carrots). Mix. When veggies hot, add cooked rice and more sauce. Add beaten eggs when nearly done. Mix.

9629 2018-05-18 17:44:53 The real reason the West doesn't want Iran to get nuclear weapons is that if it does, no one would then be able to invade Iran. Given Peak Oil, the West needs that option to secure Iran's oil reserves for itself in the event of an economic collapse here.

9662 2018-05-18 17:40:47 Maybe because wypipo aren’t under threat from geopolitical disaster/environment pillaging by unscrupulous oil/water/logging companies to the extent that indigenous peoples are? Hence the UN Declaration.This “I want a lollipop,too!” mentality is seriously getting on my tit ends.
9663 2018-05-18 17:40:45 it'll be fine, it just floats on the surface and really doesn't do much of anything, and even if it did stick to the pasta it's a pretty neutral oil

9678 2018-05-18 17:39:28 That is for gas associated with crude oil. Condensate is liquid associated from gas. Temperature and pressure is the key factor in what liquid is dissolved in the gas. The higher the temperature and the lower the pressure the more condensate produced

9696 2018-05-18 17:36:11 With engines allowing 40 mpg who would buy vehicles powered by less efficient engines that were more expensive to run? There should be freedom of choice for the customer, not for manufacturers and oil companies to control the market.
9697 2018-05-18 17:36:01 The price of oil, hence, the price of Gasoline is floating on thin air! It is defying gravity and the free Market principles of supply and demand. It will tumble. And it will tumble shortly. Supplies are only restrained by OPEC, yet US Production is crashing through every ceiling
9698 2018-05-18 17:35:57 Well it depends on the mix. Gold is supposed to be firmingband anti aging but the amount in the oils is very less so not as effective. The oil blends themselves should be effective enough.check @whimsybeauty on Instagram

9700 2018-05-18 17:35:51 You are part of it, selling snake oil,  producing videos trashing the modern world, claiming degeneracy has won, and pointing the finger at the perpetrators.

You literally make a living creating paranoia, lies, nihilism and groundless conspiracy.
9701 2018-05-18 17:35:51 No one ever said that oil spills were going to destroy the world. What everyone is saying is that acidification of the ocean is going to destroy the world have you seen what's happening to the coral reefs the dead zones in the oceans?

9712 2018-05-18 17:35:06 Eat less fried food - foods that have been deep-fried in oil or ghee, such as samosas, are high in fat. This can lead to weight gain and increase the risk of diabetes and other health problems. Try steaming, baking, boiling or grilling food instead.
9713 2018-05-18 17:34:51 Exports have done very well for us, they are driving growth; we exported oil, industrial equipment, chemicals, plastics, cotton, computers and electronic equipment @PNJankowski at #GlobalHouston

9723 2018-05-18 17:33:48 I.e. if the proletariat has All Of The Money, you could force capitalists to surrender the means of production like you could if you had All Of The Oil or All Of The Metal. If you assume that, it’s a very short trip to abolishing wage labor entirely.

9734 2018-05-18 17:32:34 Not surprising. deteriorating macroeconomic indicators high oil prices, lack of credit supply fr bank is weighing on mind of investors
9735 2018-05-18 17:32:32 But not every president has shady dealings in Russian energy companies financed by shady Qatari investment funds (the group that met in the Trump Towers). If oil spikes, the Trumps win

9737 2018-05-18 17:32:23 The land mass of Canada and the emissions we use would be almost at Zero. Look at China, people wearing masks everyday. Even if Canada dropped every oil and gas project the rest of the world would continue on. The Paris accord is nothing really to other countries but ours I guess
9738 2018-05-18 17:32:10 Just once I'd like to just get an oil change without being pressured to flush this or replace my dirty air filter. It's taken me 3 months to even come here and it's a mile away from my house. I know my faults. Please stop judging me sir.
9739 2018-05-18 17:32:05 Hard to swallow pill: fish oil
9740 2018-05-18 17:32:04 If that's the case, stop buying / consuming it.. 80%+ of GHG's occur at the usage phase (not extractions, transport, refining).  Only people who don't consume oil are cave dwelling hermits and even they cut trees and burn trees. PS, wind and solar do not exist without oil.

9742 2018-05-18 17:31:52 Iranian oil production has soared since the JCPOA.  It had dropped  before that.  Did Iranian production go down because they couldn’t sell the oil, because they couldn’t get paid for the oil or because they couldn’t buy the expertise they needed to produce the oil?
9743 2018-05-18 17:31:50 Niggas didn't care about that it was cheap and got you drunk quick. Thats all you needed. Didn't care if it tasted like flavored motor oil
9744 2018-05-18 17:31:48 Thank you
9745 2018-05-18 17:31:46 It is all dependent on the pressure and temperature of the gas field and the oil associated with it. Higher the pressure the greater the velocity of the gas and the heavier the materials it can entrain.
9746 2018-05-18 17:31:30 Coconut oil and cocoa butter. Best duo ever 
9747 2018-05-18 17:31:27 My skin is dry & scaly but I ran out of coconut oil shoukd I rub smart balance all over my body?

9751 2018-05-18 17:30:50 .@AndreShakti this event goes against everything you stand for as an educator, please dont go or promote it. there are dozens of people who have spoken out against OIL.
9752 2018-05-18 17:30:11 Thingspeak says your oil is low
9753 2018-05-18 17:29:52 Very true, but even after the islamic revolution during the reign of Khomeini Iranian oil was being bought by Israel thanks to Marc Rich.
9754 2018-05-18 17:29:52 Toss dem brocculs in oil, salt and peppa, put a container in the oven that's lined with foil, then preheat to 500. When it beeps, load you up some brocs and spread them out. Fuss them around after ten if you want, but that's optional. Then eat.
9755 2018-05-18 17:29:52 Get on the coconut oil, it's part saturated fat but is used as an energy source...especially when walking over striding edge in the Lakes. I gather you do that regularly since recording "Home from Home" !

9762 2018-05-18 17:29:00 Car is in for an oil change so I am doing my 4 mile walk in the soul-destroying confines of the mall.
9763 2018-05-18 17:28:54 The local police announced that in a live update about an hour ago on TV. He said in the building and areas adjacent to the school buildings.
9764 2018-05-18 17:28:50 Psalm 23: 4. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. 5. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
9765 2018-05-18 17:28:46 Just so you know, 

Before @APCNigeria and @MBuhari go blaming @GEJonathan ; Oil is now $80 per barrel, as at $64 per barrel during @GEJonathan 's Regime which fuel was selling at N87 per litre.

Thank You!

9767 2018-05-18 17:28:36 It depends. If there's oil or coal, sure.
9768 2018-05-18 17:28:35 Double that would be thanks to your pals at WM squandering it, and don't forget the huge tax cuts to oil companies from WM.

9771 2018-05-18 17:27:30 Wow. You’ve bought in. Check how much $ this snake oil salesman is raking in. You’d be better off reading How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. The modern “original”.

9773 2018-05-18 17:27:22 Ok so I put manuka essential oil on my hair like 3 days ago and I still can’t wash out the smell .... I’ve washed my hair too many times I don’t want to strip out the natural oils of my hair ... arghhh
9774 2018-05-18 17:27:16 Was talking about the non existent oil revenues.
9775 2018-05-18 17:27:10 It's a freaking pyramid scheme. That was the plan concocted in 2013 reaffirmed in 2015 into 2016. Putin wanted Trump to win = no sanctions, business, oil and guns. Trump gets hotels and loans to save his bankrupt business. Why is so freaking hard 2 understand!?!
9776 2018-05-18 17:27:09 @scaredmoneydontmake I’m sure my BA trade , RTN and NOC will pay for gas but thx for your concern...I hedge with oil also
9777 2018-05-18 17:27:06 Scotland gets zero from oil revenues, all revenue goes to the chancellor in Westminster.
9778 2018-05-18 17:26:59 Let’s run for pm and because our social media presence is fire we will win as the Green Party and actually invest in renewable clean energy sources and then big oil dies and we save the climate all because the world followed our ways because of shit posting
9779 2018-05-18 17:26:46 If u think globally and locally we can continue with the same energy use (aka oil, fracking, coal, etc...) then there is no use for discussion since u obviously don't understand science
9780 2018-05-18 17:26:17 We been knew. It's oil money
9781 2018-05-18 17:26:17 I agree but there are natural warming and cooling periods which run in correlation, and when the black stuff runs the global economy and the US dollar is the reserve currency -pegged to oil, we have a problem ....kicking the can towards the next generation rings a big bell indeed
9782 2018-05-18 17:26:01 needa go do my oil change

9785 2018-05-18 17:25:48 Never go to @FirestoneAuto off Highland/Poplar. Had an appointment for oil change and been here 3 hours.. ridiculous.
9786 2018-05-18 17:25:25 Hele, teď jsem začala používat Tea tree oil a zatím to pomáhá:)
9787 2018-05-18 17:25:19 I love you both and am apparently hallucinating the smell of vegetable oil now
9788 2018-05-18 17:25:13 Can't speak for Albertians but as a Canadian we need to get real on climate change and the tar sands are disastrous.  Keystone XL alone will tip us all over the edge.  In BC especially In Vancouver/Victoria we are dead set against the KM pipeline and oil tankers.

9797 2018-05-18 17:24:23 Scotland consistently make a loss regarding oil revenues
9798 2018-05-18 17:24:18 That's fair, so in my estimation u should b fighting for our politicians to stop giving away those resources. For ex: The % that Norway gets for oil (yes I know it's different type) is far greater. We r receiving very little profit. We do need to reduce our use of dirty energy
9799 2018-05-18 17:24:01 NIGGA NEVER GOT MY CAR WASHED , CLEANED , FIXED , OIL CHANGE NO NUFFIN ... BUT I USED HIM YALL

9809 2018-05-18 17:23:02 They should just tell us that excessive oil is bad for the body instead of lebelining our beautiful dish as unhealthy
9810 2018-05-18 17:22:54 I love the way u WANNABE Romans thriw around the Rothschild name like you know what you are talking about. Enjoy the freedom you have and let the Middle East settle there own conflicts. If they didn't have oil nobody would actually give a darn
9811 2018-05-18 17:22:50 I use hair mayonnaise too! But I only use that every couple months because it has quite a bit of protein & sometimes it causes my hair to get breakage if I use too much protein, & yes my hair loves coconut oil too, I prepoo with it before I wash every week

I just had to buy some, and the tech said "RAM prices are very high right now" like it was oil or gold.
9816 2018-05-18 17:22:27 Why are you complaining about your sorry ass while our children are getting shot, the UN is rebuking us, we have record high temperatures, oil prices are shooting up, infrastructure is deteriorating, the Middle East is blowing up, and racist assholes are screaming in our streets?

9818 2018-05-18 17:22:05 I hate that you call gas extraction (shale or otherwise) CLEAN - I'm sure you're not stupid enough to believe that. It DOES pollute & contributes to climate change.
Yes, CLEANER than filthy oil & coal, but in no way clean.
Try upgrading support for renewables #climatechange

9820 2018-05-18 17:21:58 Basically they are a cult.  A cult that thinks its okay to do all kinds of horrible things. Just look at Moore in Alabama. That is kind of typical.

A select few will "sit on the throne", those being certain special white men of course. Snake oil salesmen the lot!

9825 2018-05-18 17:21:45 Even more tragic is that Nigerians protested in support of the corruption perpetuated by the same oil marketers. The Ojota crew will forever be remembered as willing participants in the conspiracy to maintain corruption.
9826 2018-05-18 17:21:40 @elonmusk It's obvious you're the most hated by oil companies just by making life better. You'll be loved if you polluted earth.

9828 2018-05-18 17:21:27 This is something I need to get better at myself. I also identified oil names last year and bought $apc low 40s, $mro teens, cvx $80...but in ever case didn’t hold long enough to make good money. Took about 2 years for things to really flush out in oil and sentiment to shift
9829 2018-05-18 17:21:26 Why are gas prices per litre more now than they were when oil was over $100/barrel? #dyingidustryrippingusoff
9830 2018-05-18 17:21:10 You could do a lot worse than follow the money into #MYN mate.  Company is simply transformed from its old days.   @TexasEddieG is a CEO who delivers and doesn’t take the piss.  My AIM oil share of 2018 and lots now are taking an interest.
9831 2018-05-18 17:21:06 its beyond me that ANYONE with an inkling of awareness can listen to this man and not realize he is selling snake oil.
9832 2018-05-18 17:21:00 Cause rn I’m using hair mayonnaise as my deep conditioner & as I am for my co wash. I use proclaim products for my shampoo. I just know for a fact that my hair loves coconut oil. That’s the only thing I’m certain it likes

9850 2018-05-18 17:18:25 Not really. There are lots of moving parts to $CAD apart from $OIL. The economy is more diversified than pure oil dependent currency. There are  risks to NAFTA now. I would play for the technicals.

9864 2018-05-18 17:16:20 TIL there's an oil and gas field called Who Dat field.

9866 2018-05-18 17:16:14 I know my strengths and weaknesses as well as theirs. It would be mixing oil and water. Nothing would get done. I'm a great mom, just wouldn't be the best teacher. I know a lot of home schooled kids and they're all very intelligent. Like I said, to each their own.
9867 2018-05-18 17:16:00 I read somewhere that she took accutane before and now she consumes coconut oil to maintain the skin.
9868 2018-05-18 17:15:53 Another export ban will probably happen if oil jumps to $150-$200

9875 2018-05-18 17:14:47 Have you heard of liquid oil asphalt? Probably not, because liquid oil asphalt is only used for about 5% of asphalt pavement projects, while the 95% use aggregate asphalt.

9891 2018-05-18 17:13:35 Just so you know, 

Before @APCNigeria and @MBuhari go blaming @GEJonathan ; Oil is now $80 per barrel, as at $64 per barrel during @GEJonathan 's Regime which fuel was selling at N87 per litre.

Thank You!
9892 2018-05-18 17:13:33 Socializing the means of consumption without doing anything about the nature of what’s consumed is perverted, to say the least. Shades of T@|\|den’s “why didn’t we use the Libya opportunity to take their oil”?
9893 2018-05-18 17:13:32 Words are amazing, like one restaurant charging £6.50 for 'pasta with Parmesan and olive oil' and another £12.95 for 'fresh tagliatelle drizzled with extra virgin olive oil from the Tuscan hills and sprinkled with Grana Padano'

9955 2018-05-18 17:05:25 Qatar has a ruler. I forget if prince or emir. He was dealing both sides of the chasm. In other words, he was friendly w Iran. It made the Saudi prince mad.
