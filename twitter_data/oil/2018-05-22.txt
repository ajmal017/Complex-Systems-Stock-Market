“Big Tech is an extractive industry. Just like oil and gas, it needs to be regulated".

123 2018-05-22 23:47:26 That's because the oil companies are once again, jacking up fuel costs for NO REASON what so ever..  Nearly $3.00 a gallon again in a few short weeks and there is NO legit reason.  Summer fuel should jack up the price by .50 or more.. theft is what this is.

They just said on ESPN Joe Maddon drinks that crazy butter-coconut-oil-coffee that our clubbie in Bako was making for the team every day back in 2013. It sounds like the grossest crap on earth.

Did Juan make that for your guys @jasondschwartz ?

132 2018-05-22 23:46:40 Thanks for the insight. Similar to the 'curse of oil' elsewhere.

What about food? All the sources I've seen says food production has only declined in recent years as a result of bad business climate for farmers, importers & sellers.
133 2018-05-22 23:46:37 With EM slowing sequentially, will oil therefore slow?

152 2018-05-22 23:44:04 Sorry what can't we have both ways?  We already have oil from Alberta flowing to BC and it's still unconstitutional to sanction provinces, so yes, yes we can have it both ways.

190 2018-05-22 23:39:02 It would probably be a lot of unnecessary work but I suppose one could sauté/caramelize onions in the deep frying oil, and then remove the onions from it could give the batter onion flavor? Or perhaps more easily just add onion powder to your batter mix?

219 2018-05-22 23:35:20 I support oil

, it’s necessary for everything we do. I don’t suggest that because there may be alternatives, that those alternatives aren’t developed. But it’s important to keep things stable while we do so. Activists pretend they don’t use oil, but we all do.
220 2018-05-22 23:35:03 May we assume you're lobbying the federal govt to stop all shipment of hazardous materials by rail and ship anywhere in BC and off the West Coast? Including all the oil tankers that are currently plying Canadian and American waters? Or is it just Alberta you hate?

224 2018-05-22 23:34:35 OPEC has cut production the past several months to raise prices.  US is producing the most oil it ever has.   Russia and others not in OPEC have cut back some but not as much as they agreed to with the OPEC and other cartels.  That is a good thing Russia didn't cut back as much.

227 2018-05-22 23:33:56 So you're argument that the Republican Party hasn't changed is to invoke the name of the man that created the Progressive Tax, and Natural Resource Conservation. Aren't you the party of Flat Tax and drilling for oil in ANWR?
228 2018-05-22 23:33:44 I blame greedy oil companies who look for any opportunity to jack up prices to screw consumers. But, Trump gave them an excuse they could use even though it's totally bogus.

247 2018-05-22 23:31:28 The cruellest twist of fate was oil being so plentiful beneath the feet of one of the most barbaric, xenophobic, misogynistic regimes on earth. But for oil with which to buy western politicians, press, and bombs, the house of Saud would not have been so prodigious in its crimes.

258 2018-05-22 23:30:24 OPEC is reportedly considering easing oil supply cuts in June. Reuters first reported the cartel could ramp up production as Iran and Venezuela face potential supply disruptions. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, shed session gains following the news.
259 2018-05-22 23:30:19 US is producing the most oil that it has since the early 70's.  The ME being unstable and people speculating about it is the only reason prices are going up.  The US could build more refineries to convert even more to gas if it was a supply problem but it is not.

261 2018-05-22 23:30:06 That's the trendy view for gold lately. But I disagree. Gold went up 2300% before. Which was a lot higher than oil or USD devalued. It's an asset like any other. High stock/flow doesn't help when nobody wants to sell. The powers that be are printing like never in history.

272 2018-05-22 23:29:02 I tried adding butter to my coffee on a whim, since it seems to be going around. I didn't have coconut oil, so I just used a tiny bit of olive oil. It's actually not that bad. Makes it taste a bit more earthy. Still had to add my regular cream and sugar though.

287 2018-05-22 23:27:22 @jimmyfallon @FallonTonight #worstadviceever We told one of the boys on a school skiing trip that coconut oil was sunblock. One day on the slopes later, and he had a head like a blistered tomato

All this new energy can make you feel exhausted and sore. Slow down, go to sleep early and take a lavender essential oil bath.

292 2018-05-22 23:26:42 I’ve got some snake oil to sell you too. #Priceless 
293 2018-05-22 23:26:36 Is that what Trump is doing in Iran? Trying to take their oil. He has said we should take their oil.

316 2018-05-22 23:24:14 Tell me, simple one...how do you think people will feel in November when they see that the average increase in healthcare is 16.4% directly because of Trump, talk about tax increases, and 85/bbl oil are three of the biggest stories of the financial news?
317 2018-05-22 23:24:14 Not sure if you mean latex paint or oil-based.  Two entirely different tweets.  Let's to with oil. I have two concerns: My health and the Environment's well-being.  The first thing I do is charge the brush before use by soaking and then drying mineral spirits. After use....1/2
318 2018-05-22 23:24:11 History suggests otherwise as does positioning, sentiment, technicals, and EWT... may be just about time frames. Crashes are deflationary, hence why Oil falls, but will soar thereafter:
Jul 2008 (147.27) – Feb 2009 (33.55) = -77%
Oct 2000 (36.90) – Nov 2001 (17.12) = -54%

326 2018-05-22 23:22:51 Dont blabber. Central excise tax is fixed/litre.Its VAT that adds to the price along with oil price

362 2018-05-22 23:18:04 No. More regulations and it’s the summer blend not the winter blend. But nice try. Oil and gas never makes a penny on the gallon
363 2018-05-22 23:17:50 Oil prices going to go up only becas of very serious restrictions imposed by Trump on Iran. America has kept the oil prices high first by attacking Iraq, then Libya and now Iran. Venezuela had already been decimated. Russia could fill up the gap but it wont be in their interest.

389 2018-05-22 23:15:29 So oil price stood at $100 per barrel for 16yrs PDP was in power.

426 2018-05-22 23:11:36 So my uncle has been battling Liver/Lung Cancer - He has been going to treatment and eventually had to fight off pnemonia. Not much helped...however a friend was able to provide cannabis oil as a form of last resort...after a scan today...the cancer has reduced by...

431 2018-05-22 23:11:06 I 100% agree but as we know changing our lovely American friends to try this  will be hard as the American and Brits think Oil is King. maybe one small step from Scotland could be enough to make other countries take the big leap.

434 2018-05-22 23:10:44 I will let coconut oil soak in my hair any time I’m in the sun & over night as a hair mask. I apply it while it’s wet and then just tie it up in a bun. I will also use rosemary essential oil mixed with grape seed oil and castor oil! I apply while wet & let sit over night as well!

440 2018-05-22 23:10:30 Whatever. All I know is something ain’t right down there. Maybe it’s oil spills or the Atlantic Ocean has different taste than the Pacific Ocean. Something ain’t right though 
441 2018-05-22 23:10:30 They took the oil for what, four years. Obamacare, “you’re going to take care of me and I will not tell you to compete.
442 2018-05-22 23:10:25 Thanks for the rising gas prices we, your constituents, are paying!  Exporting American crude raises gas prices!  You are more interested in oil company profits than your constituents!  Enjoy your last days in the Senate!

446 2018-05-22 23:10:11 Kulit nampak sekata jelah, yang lain tu belum lagi. Untuk oil dengan dry boleh pakai
447 2018-05-22 23:10:03 This is faulty logic given that OPEC has cut production. Presidents have very little to do with oil prices.
448 2018-05-22 23:09:31 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

453 2018-05-22 23:09:01 Most of that increase was the discovery of oil and the ability to transfer goods and services and create plastics.  Which also directly correlates with the population increase.  Both with crash when oil runs out.
454 2018-05-22 23:08:52 Coconut oil, don’t use heat on it and trim it  
455 2018-05-22 23:08:48 Ya. That’s why he armed Ukraine, attacked Syria, and opened up Domestic Oil Drilling w cutting of regs- all of which are crippling to Russia- bc Russia takeover. Lol
456 2018-05-22 23:08:33 drink more fruit-infused water (especially while working ) and eat more raw fruits.

460 2018-05-22 23:08:16 Yes,  they are.  Palestinians are being murdered by the Israelis.  Our people are being executed here by white supremacists.  There still isn't a shortage of oil.

464 2018-05-22 23:07:55 Oh yeah, The Tyee. That publication knows so much about Alberta's OIL sands and pipelines that it doesn't have space to report on BC's mines and logging messes. Actually the Tyee does not report news. It trys to make news. Not the role of a real news media.

469 2018-05-22 23:07:13 Besides that, we are in the ME for one reason. Oil

Who is going to pump oil out of radioactive soil.
470 2018-05-22 23:07:10 We are increasing our oil consumption on a daily basis. The planet has passed tipping points and is releasing methane into the Arctic in catastrophic amounts. There is no going back, and to pretend that we can do something about it is not my cup of tea. There is no more time.
471 2018-05-22 23:07:10 Zuniga Aero days it’s first hybrid electric plane will be delivered in 2022. Just imagining the day when we have all EP’s. Great replacement for oil. Big demand for lithium.
472 2018-05-22 23:07:09 I am neither Against nor For Kinder Morgan Pipeline.  The pipeline to me is not the real issue.  Why are we not refining our own oil is my concern.  Are we a third world country now?
473 2018-05-22 23:06:57 Fire the engineer and his boss and the city manager and recall the city council and repeal the state design standards and indict the oil lobbyists and replace the legislature

480 2018-05-22 23:06:06 What do you do if you get coconut oil in your eye?! I feel betrayed, i thought coconut oil was the cure 
481 2018-05-22 23:06:01 Oil production is at the highest level in our history. 

If we can't afford things now, we never will. 

You failed on royalties.  We are getting hosed.
482 2018-05-22 23:05:30 In the 70s when the #govt wasn't so #corrupted & gas prices were getting out of hand, the governing Liberals ordered Oil companies to sell their stations. The companies became the wholesaler. It worked then & it would work again with political will @AndreaHorwath @theJagmeetSingh

484 2018-05-22 23:05:19 Those low prices were due to Obamacare lifting the ban on exporting oil after 40 years.  You left that part out of your attempt at misdirection. #ThanksObama
485 2018-05-22 23:05:16 Oil
486 2018-05-22 23:04:48 That's odd. 'Lies'
The UK generates £200bn per annum in total tax revenue from direct oil and gas activities.
But the UK has never sold a single drop....
How do they generate the money, and who has been lying?
Feel free to explain 'geographical share' while you're at it.

496 2018-05-22 23:03:55 #SolarFacts - You can use solar power to run air conditioners, hot water heaters, and everything natural gas, electricity, or oil currently fuels. It’s the cheaper, safer, and more eco-friendly solution. #GridCityEnergy #GoSolar #SaveMoney #SaveThePlanet #ThisIStheFuture 
497 2018-05-22 23:03:54 I agree. A single-state example is Colorado: An urban corridor up the front range along I-25 that is growing too fast, surrounded by rural ranching and farming and oil/gas that is shrinking - with the oil/gas now encroaching on suburbia.
498 2018-05-22 23:03:50 How much oil went in the ocean off Florida when that 10000psi well popped? Not perfect but probably will recover. Plus there are probably a few natural leakers into the ocean as well
499 2018-05-22 23:03:44 Now let's have oil bottom out.

501 2018-05-22 23:03:37 If you could give me one good reason for Obama and Hillary selling 20% of our URANIUM  to RUSSIA (A GAS STATION). And why their plan is to get another president elected.
Opens oil production 
Sold oil to their cus
Armed Ukrain
NOT A VERY GOOD PLAN
502 2018-05-22 23:03:22 As with a lot of news articles, The title is misleading.

The article is talking about BARRELS of oil, NOT gallons! Currently in the U.S. barrels go for about $44 to $49 which roughly translates to about $1.17 before taxes. At $149 you'd be looking at $3.54 before taxes.
503 2018-05-22 23:02:54 Oddly enough laying down helps backs and fish oil. If you can take fish oil after an appendectomy. Obviously you should check with your doctor.
504 2018-05-22 23:02:50 Wow my mom can cook. If you disagree I’ll ask her to cook you a steaming pile of dicks and then you’ll know, Damn this women can make dicks cooked over some asparagus’s drizzled in olive oil and its tasty! Eww you like dicks
505 2018-05-22 23:02:44 The sun is in fact a giant ice cube that was coated in oil and lit on fire by space gods and when the fire consumes the ice cube the resulting realisation that this statement makes no sense will make the sun explode in rage.
506 2018-05-22 23:02:30 people in the oil fields don’t give a fuck. I’ll be going 85 in an 80 and they’ll still be on my ass with their big MAGA stickers on their truck

An oil crisis during the closure and Gladys will bitterly regret she introduced incompatible single deckers
511 2018-05-22 23:01:59 Olive oil will work, but because it has a low smoke point it will get very smoky at a high temp needed to sear a steak!  That’s why we recommend canola, peanut, or vegetable oil w/ a high smoke point.
512 2018-05-22 23:01:56 Too bad he mixed up 3 and S, but nice to see him correctly call out the folks who want to see Tesla loose because the oil business model is threatened.
513 2018-05-22 23:01:52 the way I see oil is as the cashflow for energy 2.0 , investing into hyrdogen and eco generation.

Did the maths , its a goer.
514 2018-05-22 23:01:51 Of course he would say that because he’s implicated in the plot, as are Brennan, Comey, and all the other swamp dwellers. A little oil spill in the swamp and a flame thrower would go a long way to clearing that swamp.

517 2018-05-22 23:01:07 This is meaningless, what's your point. Graduates on both side get about same basic pay. The allowances differ. A Dr in an oil company doesn't get as much as an engineer there. Have you asked yourself why. How many nasu staff have become VCs. You can strike forever

524 2018-05-22 23:00:36 @WhiteHouse @PressSec 3) IMO China cutting Tariff's/Import Duties to 10-15% is a great step forward to avoid stupid useless Trade Wars. #OPEC S.Arabia/Gulf cutting Supplies to push Oil barrel to $ 90-100 is the opposite: Is a stab in the back after all US has done for them,shame
525 2018-05-22 23:00:28 That was due to a combination of OPEC not cutting oil production and the oil shale boom from fracking. Neither of which had anything to do with the President

529 2018-05-22 23:00:13 Apparently one of the main causes of oily skin is actually not hydrating enough. So moisturize your skin more often but don't go overboard. Your skin produces oil to make up for it not being properly moisturized

554 2018-05-22 22:57:13 It’s a bonus but I think with technology changing exponentially, Scotland will be in a great position with green energy, etc. Oil won’t be a priority for us in the near future but others will want it for quite a while.
555 2018-05-22 22:57:10 Measured data: every month for the last 400 months has been anomalously WARM!

So going by MEASURED DATA the #GrandSolarMinimum is the invention of snake oil sellers to fleece $$$ from the foolish, damaged or gullible.

AGW is CLEARLY what is happening—by MEASURED DATA!
556 2018-05-22 22:57:10 I did (4) things today and I showered so yes I am going indica oil
557 2018-05-22 22:57:06 Not one oil tanker catastrophic spill has happened in BC waters in  the 65 years Kinder Morgan has been shipping. 
Stringent mitigations will be in place when they start shipping more oil to the world market.
558 2018-05-22 22:56:58 I think that is the "unscrupulous people selling snake oil" part.
559 2018-05-22 22:56:58 Obama didn’t bring gas prices down. Why lie for likes? The drop in gas prices was the result of OPEC not cutting production and US drop in oil imports due to the shale oil boom from fracking which Obama was against.
560 2018-05-22 22:56:39 If you read the fine print, there’s a bonus if they marry within the family
561 2018-05-22 22:56:38 Curious to see when they decide to remove his mandatory days off following his starts.
562 2018-05-22 22:56:20 Yes, indeed, and Saudi Arabia. Imagine the reimposition of oil export sanctions on Iran. Let’s hope Europe refuses that.
563 2018-05-22 22:56:16 Trump keeping his promise to Big Oil letting them make windfall huge profits on top of tax cuts just for a couple million in campaign donations

565 2018-05-22 22:55:49 I had to spend $65.00 for my dexos oil change, $69.99 for a diff service, $160.00 for transmission service, $280.00 on new tires and $120.00 to install them because I bought the tires on Amazon.
566 2018-05-22 22:55:32 Como hoy, 1936, juró a la presidencia el Hno. David Toro, que nacionalizó el petróleo y revirtió las concesiones a favor de la Standard Oil, que saboteó a Bolivia en la guerra del Chaco. Fundó YPFB y creó los ministerios de Trabajo y de Minas y Petróleo. Bolivia honra su memoria.
567 2018-05-22 22:55:15 I'm envisioning really thin pizza-like things on tortillas, with sauce and cheese, but with sushi as the toppings, and then the whole thing is folded mini-quesadilla style and then fried in oil.
568 2018-05-22 22:55:04 Mmm oil  
9 9ensarla 9ensarla!
569 2018-05-22 22:54:59 今日の電車。
隣の男子高校生2人組のひとりが
「それは流石に粉末転倒よな」
...？？
本末転倒やん！！！！
粉w末w転w倒w
なに粉を転ばしてんねん！
ってつっこみたくなりました。
今日1日笑ってられるわw

さぁ今日も張り切って参りましょう
果たしてボケだったのか。
570 2018-05-22 22:54:56 So ur ok with #PollutingPruitt hiding his corruption, lining his pockets, lining the pockets of polluters, poisoning our air & water & allowing oil & mining companies to not have to restore the land after a spill or leak?
571 2018-05-22 22:54:54 @RachelNotley  Re: BC's lawsuit she says: First they don't want our oil but then they are suing us to get our oil. #bcpoli #ableg
572 2018-05-22 22:54:54 Grrr I forgot to put coconut oil in my hair and now it’s dry asf 
573 2018-05-22 22:54:51 #ScottPruitt strikes again! OK now has more seismic activity than CA bc of his dirty dealings with Big Oil, thank you very fracking much.
574 2018-05-22 22:54:50 putting the minced garlic in the heating up oil or butter before the eggs goes in is nice, penzeys spices has many good peppers and spice blends that taste good on omelettes, also eggs are good vehicle for hot sauce
575 2018-05-22 22:54:40 Even on a small screen, DUNKIRK's oil scene still just absolutely transported + transfixed me
576 2018-05-22 22:54:37 Natural gas and oil is like lubricant to the earth. You can't just keep drinking the milkshake. It runs dry. Fault lines crumble. Why are we choosing to ignore reality? The eruption I predicted months ago continues in Hawaii. More pipelines are in construction. #hubris
577 2018-05-22 22:54:26 Coco oil price is ₹130 nobody cry! Rice is over 60. But cry of petrol, it's related to world trading , just don't drive for fun, take other methods
578 2018-05-22 22:54:26 What about “Unknown Region” Oil?
Tens of £Billions not counted as it doesn’t come ashore in Scotland, refined and pumped straight into England and Europe, doesn’t count as Scottish?
Also Whisky sales, FIVES times as much as Irish Whiskey but our is ONLY worth same £4-5Billion?
579 2018-05-22 22:54:16 @JustinTrudeau I’m politely asking you to take action and be involved in this ridiculous dispute between BC and Alberta and start construction on the pipeline. As a British Columbian I don’t feel like paying for overpriced gas and oil because everyone keeps acting like children.
580 2018-05-22 22:54:10 I've heard amazing things about oil based cleansers!!! I have well oily skin but I've got so much unused coconut oil in the cupboard I might as well give it a go thank u!!
581 2018-05-22 22:54:00 Got my oil change & tire rotated. My car is ready to hit the road. 
582 2018-05-22 22:53:32 .@liamdann @nzherald ‘We have started to pay at the pump for Donald Trumps tough call on Iran’. Well of course higher oil prices are great for the USA and its frackers too. Hmmmm....makes you wonder!
583 2018-05-22 22:53:27 El de la pescadería me pidió que te dijera que el post net se le cayó al freezer y que tararira viva no vende. Beso en el opi carita de Oil
584 2018-05-22 22:53:25 Gotta go to Honda an get my oil changed 
585 2018-05-22 22:53:25 Quieren el oil ...q importa con tal q salga maduro.
586 2018-05-22 22:53:12 And Canada continues to import Saudi oil.
587 2018-05-22 22:53:12 Maybe you should focus your energies on oil.
588 2018-05-22 22:53:04 All this Because I said I've known for a while. It is so freakin funny how it is so oil and water. Lol Just curious, seriously, why are you a never Trumper?
589 2018-05-22 22:52:57 Once I get this job at the oil rig I will
590 2018-05-22 22:52:55 All they have to do is not say crazy stuff. They. Just. Can't. Do. It.
591 2018-05-22 22:52:46 But you didn't answer the question was nationalizing the oil industry positive or negative for Venezuela?
592 2018-05-22 22:52:45 #API Inventories:
Crude:     -1.3Mb
Gasoline: +980K
Distillate: -1.3Mb
Cushing:  -822K

*Overall, $CL_F #Oil inventories continue to DRAW, that is all that matters. I don't care about the estimates, the analysts have been mostly wrong since the lows.
593 2018-05-22 22:52:16 On a side note I'm praying the Democrats loose spectacularly. 
594 2018-05-22 22:52:15 One country? Then please explain why all the risk is to BC and all the profit is to AB and a Texas oil company. That's like putting your foot at risk for the benefit of your elbow -- it's all one body, right?

Not going to happen.
595 2018-05-22 22:51:52 She is a “snake oil seller”.  Insane!
596 2018-05-22 22:51:52 Swear old motor oil be the hardest to get off your clothes
597 2018-05-22 22:51:46 Oh whew! Way less oil pressure 
598 2018-05-22 22:51:31 The white woman calmly turned to me and said well Trish, the squeaky wheel gets the oil. I said heardddddd you, and she started cracking up. She also help me set up emails with some next level business acumen I’ve never even read...so all week I mirrored those exact actions
599 2018-05-22 22:51:25 Yes.
600 2018-05-22 22:51:23 なかなか無い経験だとは思う。
土で汚れて、肥料撒いて、鶏捌いたくせに、OILかぶって、油脂に汚れて、金属加工しつつも、機械相手にするってのは。
601 2018-05-22 22:51:19 Yeah. I am sure that Alaskans are thrilled to have Anwr opened to Oil Drilling. The last Natural refuge in America. And Big Oil might be turned away? Oh my. Scott Pruit will have nightmares.
602 2018-05-22 22:51:14 Lower gas prices is a very short-sighted & transitory solution. Better solution = get off oil.
603 2018-05-22 22:51:13 Aww I didn’t know you already had our face oil!! Thanks for your support  Customers with oily skin love our Mandarin Cleansing Oil because it dissolves grease while tricking your skin into producing less oil! It’s a great choice too 
604 2018-05-22 22:51:10 Pernah baca dmna gt katanya kl muka yg oily pake face oil malah jd bagus, cmiiw
605 2018-05-22 22:51:06 7 billion dollars could be spent much more intelligently by building a refinery beside the oil sands. This creates many high paying ALBERTA jobs... Too smart for you?
606 2018-05-22 22:51:04 Yes, global warming will meet a key GOP objective: enabling Putin to more easily navigate the Arctic and tap oil reserves - oh yeah, it incidentally may do the same for Alaska #ExxonValdez
607 2018-05-22 22:51:01 (1)  Listening to Aaj ki baat 22/8 and all participants asking to lower Oil Prices. All have  super knowledge of crude price but no clue of expenses involved to purify and sell oil. No one pays their due taxes but want all facilities so where do Govt get funds? (1)
608 2018-05-22 22:50:52 What about words like extra virgin or oil. Probably won't come up.
609 2018-05-22 22:50:45 ไม่คิดจะลงทุนกับชุดหน่อยเลยหรอ ในป่าแมลงก็เยอะออะไรก็เยอะ
610 2018-05-22 22:50:45 I'm down to 2k calories a day, doing nutrisystem stuff. I generally eat salads with balsalmic and olive oil after work. Even giving up beer. I may have a gastro issue but nothing yet conclusive
611 2018-05-22 22:50:45 U ain’t said nothing slick to a can of oil. I’m ready to do that and one w my other homie
612 2018-05-22 22:50:37 Just cooked chicken in a rosemary infused coconut oil and it was ..
BANGING!!!!
613 2018-05-22 22:50:20 Ramcharger has Kendall GT-1 50 weight in it. I’ve still got half a case of that oil around somewhere.  Frontier has 10-30 Mobil 1 in it iirc. I only have changed the oil in it twice
614 2018-05-22 22:50:15 O nthekele coconut oil
615 2018-05-22 22:50:12 I'd like to imagine this as a George W. Bush oil painting.
616 2018-05-22 22:50:05 I went to Valvoline instant oil change and they told me to pop my hood and I didn’t know how and then I most definitely paid too much money for my oil change
617 2018-05-22 22:49:57 Glad to have #fastorange to clean off gear oil after changing out a gearbox this afternoon
618 2018-05-22 22:49:54 Tá. Zerou CIDE. 
Oil bate 100 e dólar volta nos 3,70. Governo faz o que? Corta os pulsos?
619 2018-05-22 22:49:54 I believe it lies at the doorstep of big energy.coal and oil our the earths cooling system.......keep taking the earths coolant and the temperature will rise
620 2018-05-22 22:49:52 It was oil companies and investors that continued to finance exploration and production when oil prices crashed a few years ago.
621 2018-05-22 22:49:17 Why the fuck would you use oil with a high viscosity?
622 2018-05-22 22:49:12 Wow. You , without even checking, insinuate the scientist reported was an oil coy stooge. Amazing.
623 2018-05-22 22:49:06 i've never tried using any kind of oil but i might have to try one of those at some point! thanks 
624 2018-05-22 22:49:00 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
625 2018-05-22 22:48:49 Tim Kaine is bought by D.C. Lawyers yet Betsy Devos bought her cabinet seat, Old Wilbur Ross was chairman of money laundering Cyprus bank, Tillerson CEO of Exxon, Pruitt thinks he's royalty and bought by big oil, Miller is a Neo Nazi, Trump is a crook and that's #MAGA4whom?
626 2018-05-22 22:48:49 please don’t tell the government how much oil my nose can produce
627 2018-05-22 22:48:48 i deserve to be drenched in coconut oil and reviving a body massage by oomf
628 2018-05-22 22:48:47 
629 2018-05-22 22:48:38 Then, we got all these Obama regulations put on these rigs in the Gulf. Then foreign companies bought all these American rigs. My husband rode his rig to the Persian gulf...sold out to Saudi oil company, then they got rid of American workers.
630 2018-05-22 22:48:31 @FirstAm has been a great warranty company until now! Our washing machine transmission was repaired by a tech they sent out but has been LEAKING OIL onto our clothing ever since and @FIRSTAM refuses to fix this problem! This has been going on for several weeks now!
631 2018-05-22 22:48:31 "No trade oil painting for photograph!" Hahahahaha #Brilliant
632 2018-05-22 22:48:15 Remove the photo, but oil countries hike the cost which the govt has to pay.
633 2018-05-22 22:48:03 Its not wearable at all to have blocky chunky eyebrows and nobody drips oil onto their face daily. And I'd rather see my skin, not... the makeup.
634 2018-05-22 22:47:59 Agree. I read his slider is the most unhittable pitch in MLB.  Feels like they are taking the training wheels off.  Next start v Yankees.
635 2018-05-22 22:47:50 Olive Oil - Popeye the movie was attractive to me as a young man
636 2018-05-22 22:47:41 Here I go! Starting on CBD oil! Zilis
637 2018-05-22 22:47:41 GENIE is not getting the oil that Bibi sold them that belongs to Syria. What balls he has.
638 2018-05-22 22:47:35 I can't wait until my man gets home from work so I can rub jojoba oil all ove his bod once he gets outta the shower, Mmm mm! 
639 2018-05-22 22:47:23 This Jillian Epperly with her “Jilly Juice” is dangerous.  She is stating facts that have not one bit of truth behind it.  She is like an “1850’s snake oil” seller. Jillian needs to be in jail cuz she’s giving medical info without a license. A true CON-WOMAN!
640 2018-05-22 22:47:02 The State Dept Issued 12 Demands for Ants. They Ratchet Up Oil Market Risk and Trade Tension
641 2018-05-22 22:46:56 Lmao all you need is some coconut oil a lot of pussy juice and a hot comb
642 2018-05-22 22:46:40 Girl I use pure soap and sometimes gentle magic soap n lots of Vaseline especially at night. I also mix the Vaseline with magnolia oil when I sleep sometimes. I wake up looking I caught a lick 
643 2018-05-22 22:46:31 When Gadafi took over in Libya oil prod. fell to < 1 MMbbls/d. Many said "Libya can't survive with only 1 MMbbls/d". Only ONE economist (from UK, can't recall his name) correctly said "Libya can't but Gadafi can, not the same thing. He can and will..". Similar to Vzla.??
644 2018-05-22 22:46:27 Oh please. Like Venezuela, you celebrate when oil prices are high. Then inefficiency sets  Then prices plummet. In 2016 the State was spending £12k for every £10k of tax collected. Had you won indyref you’d have been going to the IMF
645 2018-05-22 22:46:17 Just think how much gas would cost if it wasn't for investors believing in the technology to produce oil and gas. 

Do you want to buy oil from Iran!
646 2018-05-22 22:46:12 Burning the “midnight” oil all thanks to procrastination. 

Effective time management has been a myth lately 
647 2018-05-22 22:45:54 I’ve found argon oil really good for my hair, coconut oil is also good depending on hair type 
648 2018-05-22 22:45:52 15 Billion in the next decade....3.75 for each company, that doesn't seem too much for oil companies, Also they are not "raking in" that $$, maybe they will use that to upgrade their facilities, expand employment ect.
649 2018-05-22 22:45:47 Oil change breaks my hair nails
650 2018-05-22 22:45:47 Man that gif is gold even without the caption... but with it—perfection.
651 2018-05-22 22:45:47 Oil Can Boyd.  Pre cocaine days.
652 2018-05-22 22:45:46 Blend 9 tsps coffee with 1 cup chowder. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Roast. Serve for brunch
653 2018-05-22 22:45:41 Mullahs couldn't save the Iranian economy with $100s of billions from $100/barrel oil hay-days, no amount of Russian money can save them now. Plus Russia never sounds that kind of money on a collapsing regime, Assad was an exception and was funded by mostly iranian $$ not Russia
654 2018-05-22 22:45:40 It is probably because :
(1) Check ingredients, ada SLS tak ? SLS is a potebtial irritant bcs it fries out the skin
(2) High pH. Cleanser yang pH tinggi mmg akan dry out our skin like crazy & could damage your skin barrier.
(3) Ada ingredients lain yg drying (eg tea tree oil)
655 2018-05-22 22:45:26 Not really as (don't have the figures at hand but) the real money in oil is the petrochemical side of the business. what you're typing with the light switch you use all plastic and all have oil in them, could be changed in the future but as it stands Nope, to much profit in oil.
656 2018-05-22 22:45:18 On a completely separate note, getting ready for another night of Trout & Ohtani. Didn't get to watch his start on Sunday until last night & he just keeps getting better. 2nd half of the season should be interesting.
657 2018-05-22 22:45:08 The natural gas and oil industry is and will continue to be a major source of STEM jobs and we are committed to encouraging diversity. Check out @InnoTechToday's Spring 2018 article about our work!
658 2018-05-22 22:44:39 Just noticed the multiple oil stains on my window at work caused by pressing my forehead up against the glass to look at the outside world daily

660 2018-05-22 22:44:31 I remember the 1980s in OK when the oil business crashed and took the small banks with it.  Not having access to your money because your bank closed is not an experience I want to repeat.   Rules were put into place for a reason people.

667 2018-05-22 22:43:40 Mmm a few tips if you don't already do them: 
- Clean your face both before and after makeup with a good micellar water 
- Moisturize your face daily, I do right before makeup but just whenever tbh, should stop excessive oil 
- If it doesn't work just get blotting sheets/powder?
668 2018-05-22 22:43:37 Wouldn’t even use quali for ur oil
669 2018-05-22 22:43:31 Thanks chase! Feel free to stop by oil city for some beer deals with @JackCiombor

672 2018-05-22 22:42:58 If Texas & North Dakota cut off the oil to Cali the economy would dry up to be the size of North Korea.
673 2018-05-22 22:42:51 BP oil spill - Gulf of Mexico. Anyone think that was a setup explosion??
674 2018-05-22 22:42:50 Many Caribbean Islands are being bribed to work with China on them getting Venezuela oil. Growth of Canada’s& western poverty end foreign aid inc refugees as the non west has enough rich to tax heavily and cut military spending.2 Go to rich families for $$favoured by war bailouts
675 2018-05-22 22:42:39 They really aren’t bad at all.  Trick is getting out the water from the noodles, supposed to dry them out then skillet w oil.  I didn’t dry them but they were still good
676 2018-05-22 22:42:35 You gon end up putting mgp in my shit instead of oil
677 2018-05-22 22:42:27 Venezuela is not socialist, it's a liberal democracy. It just has a socialist government and a lot of oil. Arguably it's a proof that their mild social policies worked, otherwise the US and EU wouldn't have tried to destroy it for 20 years. They've succeeded on many fronts
678 2018-05-22 22:42:25 Here's the deal. Shipping dilbit off to wherever makes some money.  For a huge Texas oil co, gov'ts, and  some jobs. No amount of money can replace a destroyed ecosystem.  Make money another way. There are no more ecosystems. #StopKM #ActOnClimate
679 2018-05-22 22:42:01 As do I.
680 2018-05-22 22:41:48 lolol you might be low on oil & just need to add more
681 2018-05-22 22:41:28 There is a reason some have left Alberta oil game and it has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with profit
682 2018-05-22 22:41:25 1. The same way other countries do. And it’ll be easier for us as our oil revenues will be entirely ours. 2. The same £ we use now until we move to the £ Scots, which will rapidly be worth more than £ Sterling. 3. By remaining in the EU. Ask me another!
683 2018-05-22 22:40:51 Tops occur on bullish news ie. Iran sanctions or inventory depletion. Just like we bottomed when Iran came back online and oil was so plentiful there was no place left to store it
684 2018-05-22 22:40:50 I’ve bought the balancing oil, I’m leaning towards mandarin cleansing oil more than the aloe Vera one x

689 2018-05-22 22:40:19 Ive noticed that i hate almost everything deep fried. I SMELL THE OIL. I HATE IT.
690 2018-05-22 22:40:16 Sounds drastic but in reality it isn't very relevant for Maduro. Their true funding comes from Gold (e.g., arco minero) and COKE trade (much higher $$ volume than oil) with various other sources. Do not mistaken "Vzla.'s income" with "Maduro regime's income", very different.
691 2018-05-22 22:40:15 That all-important pipeline if built will one day be used to pipe in desalinated water created by green energy from BC to Alberta to water the desert that will be Alberta once we burn all that oil and melt the rest of the glaciers that support our rivers and lakes.

699 2018-05-22 22:39:39 • brakes getting done on Friday before work. oil change on thursday. LA on saturday.
700 2018-05-22 22:39:28 Just because something is claimed doesn’t make it correct.  I suspect the oil industry would love electrics to fail
701 2018-05-22 22:39:13 It’s all about Poppies. It’s all about Oil. It’s all about Power and keeping the Deep State and Globalists in control.
702 2018-05-22 22:38:57 Depending on the car you have and the oil it takes
703 2018-05-22 22:38:54 G20 where they all get along just fine while discussing how they intend to spend all the fruits of our labours or the iranian oil show where every country attends or the iranian university teamed with US group on nuclear fusion
704 2018-05-22 22:38:47 it takes a long time to get the oil out, though
705 2018-05-22 22:38:47 Get you some CBD oil old man! You’ll feel better 
706 2018-05-22 22:38:46 I think the surprise is that they chose the young inexperienced guy over the seasoned guys.  I like the move

710 2018-05-22 22:37:14 Something with some fat or oil: mayo or plain yogurt.
711 2018-05-22 22:37:08 Oil price rises because evil Saudi Arabia have decreased the amount of crude being sold They need the money for the war which they want to start with Iran. Trump also to blame putting sanctions on Iran. Trump must go as he out of control. There is only one way out for him SOB
712 2018-05-22 22:36:52 Just bought a huge bottle of jojoba oil because I developed an allergy to coconut a while ago. I can finally start doing my nails again 
713 2018-05-22 22:36:37 Guess the comparison of safety improvements flew right over your heard there...
714 2018-05-22 22:36:31 That is another service to Putin. He owns most of Venezuela's oil now. So this leaves him free to do whatever he wants there.
715 2018-05-22 22:36:10 Slimy snake oil salesmen do not scare anyone.

Neither do fat orange asses with cartoon hair.
716 2018-05-22 22:36:05 OMG, how I love mushrooms; fried, stuffed, raw in salads but for dinner today, seasoned, sautéd in olive oil and red wine with grilled salmon and shrimp. 

Bon appetit
717 2018-05-22 22:36:02 Dealerships make money on the maintenance they do for the car they sell you. Electric Cars need next to no maintenance. No oil changes.
718 2018-05-22 22:35:56 Hi, Cefyn. CBD oil is not allowed to be sold on our site at all as it’s considered a scheduled drug. We have teams that consistently monitor our site for such listings. With millions of new listings added daily, this is an ongoing process. ~Lindsey

720 2018-05-22 22:35:35 Hi, if you're a beginner oil painter and never used "distilled turpentine" yet, don't leave it in a plastic disposable cup for a long amount of time. That shit ate through the cup and the liquid became jelly. But my desk isn't ruined
721 2018-05-22 22:35:29 You are the one who voted Tepublican knowing that their taxcut scams always end up as massive tax increases on you. What part of the deficit doubling in 6 months did you miss?
722 2018-05-22 22:35:29 Grow a brain  and maybe you can learn something. Or stay poor and live in cities that need the oil.
723 2018-05-22 22:35:28 No ! Allowing Canadian oil to be sold at 1/3 discount to our American neighbors is the biggest mistake due to lack of pipeline infrastructure. Koch brothers just keep getting richer off of Canadians.
724 2018-05-22 22:35:28 It is Palm oil I will pour in my own neighbor's gen... Palm oil and salt

734 2018-05-22 22:33:44 Trashing Dodd Frank within a decade of the biggest banking crash since the Depression is your idea of prudent legislation?  Shame on you for peddling your snake oil.
735 2018-05-22 22:33:39 Flat out lie and spin. We have hotels in that area.  Oil oil oil and infrastructure to support it.  I have seen no efforts to contain damage and especially no efforts to reclaim the land when done.  Kinder Morgan making bilkiosnfor Canada for pennies on the acre.  Why do you lie?
736 2018-05-22 22:33:23 Bahahahhahahah!!! You mean you keep falling for their taxcut scams that cost you tax increases to pay for revenue losses? So tell me, genius...when do you think the benefits are going to kick in?

744 2018-05-22 22:32:30 And there i was with olive oil all over my titties

- the white version
745 2018-05-22 22:32:26 Can someone tell me why, with all the oil we have, new pipe line, new exploration and  gas is now 3.03/gallon in New York, I guess no one told the oil companies this time to make America great . Not in the wallets
746 2018-05-22 22:32:17 あぁ〜〜^^
747 2018-05-22 22:32:14 I wonder if I should roast them. I'm a novice cook, so it has to be something easy like tossing veggies with oil and spices.
748 2018-05-22 22:32:13 Vaseline on lips and mustard oil in belly button
749 2018-05-22 22:32:09 Russia benefits from boosted oil prices and is very interested in that, along with much of the MidEast. They are a big part of the story there and with Trump. The big shock recently is around the Iran supply. There is much uncertainty as well as direct disruption
750 2018-05-22 22:32:06 Compare that to the BHP and RIO price - and then you look at FMG and see similarieties. Something aside from Oil is a bit slippery
751 2018-05-22 22:32:02 Can I use olive oil ?

753 2018-05-22 22:31:40 'Planes will get off #fossilfuels as there are much cheaper alternatives coming.
754 2018-05-22 22:31:36 Makes more sense to refine it ourselves to set the stage of world class refined oil without damage to the environment. Our gas prices would significantly drop and our neighbours to the south would drive here for inexpensive Canadian gas. Seems like a win win.
755 2018-05-22 22:31:19 Beard oil is so nice though.
756 2018-05-22 22:30:48 It's tough because of the side effects, and one my mom tried could cause liver damage. She was on Haldol for years and she was literally a vegetable. I finally got my real mom for the first time in my life and I'm almost 30. She uses Charlotte's Web oil.
757 2018-05-22 22:30:43 Presidents have little to no control over short term oil/gas prices so either way the point was moot.
758 2018-05-22 22:30:15 @BullPeedi Hey Pete just wanted to let you know I've got Saffi some extra virgin coconut oil and rubbed a little bit into her dry ears and paws and I can see a difference already of course there ain't much left on her paws now hugs to Bergs 
759 2018-05-22 22:29:58 The American way RT @CurtisScoon: Paid $3.40/Gallon for premium today.  Oil is +70/barrel. Gas prices are same as when it was +100/barrel. This is just good old fashioned greed.
760 2018-05-22 22:29:55 Straight baby oil.
761 2018-05-22 22:29:42 Or a strategic use of marbles or ordinary cooking oil.
762 2018-05-22 22:29:40 If Grenada installed solar panels  and made solar farm it would be self funding  and they would reduce their oil imports by 60%..

Make sure you keep at least 3 cans that are 5% full in your shed at all times

772 2018-05-22 22:28:29 As their premier said it: “they can do whatever they want within their jurisdiction” AB will get it’s oil products out one way or another! They can go ask QC for money going forward!
773 2018-05-22 22:28:12 Which of the youths? The lazy ones or the 60% illitrate who depand on oil money when their regions don't even produce oil? #justasking.
774 2018-05-22 22:27:56 I woke up, put the prewash mask on my hair, washed it, detangled it, added moisturizer and oil, trimmed my ends, cleaned up all the hair that got on the floor, and still gotta go deal with these people at work...fuck a sick day...I need a job with wash days
775 2018-05-22 22:27:52 Aw! Feel better. Along with hot toddy- I make a mixture of fresh lemon juice, honey ( local) and olive oil. It help ease the tickle- The oil soothes your throat! Get better.
776 2018-05-22 22:27:51 you definitely need one, your hands are so gross from working with all that oil and shit
777 2018-05-22 22:27:47 Not if you apply a similar % fine to Banks & Oil companies for fraud and Pollution respectfully. 
All is fair in Fire, Fraud and Oil Spills.
778 2018-05-22 22:27:43 So let us understand this clearly.  The Horgan government doesn't want Alberta oil flowing through a second pipeline...along side the other one that has almost never leaked over 60 years.  But now they are suing to keep the current oil from being cutback?  Alrighty then!
779 2018-05-22 22:27:33 Interesting Steve. Can I ask what type of pain you have and how much it helps? Also is it in a pill form or oil??

784 2018-05-22 22:27:05 Unless you’re living naked in nature relying on nothing but your wits and common sense you are dependent on oil. Rubber and plastics are made from it and everything you own at one time or another has been transported. #hypocrisy
785 2018-05-22 22:27:02 Actually.... I don't mind that view. Well, apart from the oil leaks.

787 2018-05-22 22:26:55 In hindsight, the lyrics are terrible. At the time, "she was a fast machine / she kept her oil clean / ... / knocking me out, with those American thighs" had so much meaning
788 2018-05-22 22:26:49 Get some rest. Take a long warm shower and let the steam open up your airways. Drink some hot tea. Make some soup if you can. And GO TO BED EARLY! lol if you have some lavender or peppermint oil use some. No need to make it worse for yourself. We'll survive 
789 2018-05-22 22:26:48 I'm with your belief Russia is behind ISIS and its about the oil and defense industry, we are just fools to them.
790 2018-05-22 22:26:44 -From one tanker a day to seven means higher risk for our Inlet.
-I largely do but it's very hard not to because of plastic is used for EVERYTHING and also pressure by oil and gas industry on politicians to keep us dependent on oil and oil products. #PayToPlay
791 2018-05-22 22:26:38 I accidentally exploded a fish oil on myself yesterday and my hair smells like fish oil even though I've washed it since. I'm always smelling fish oil :(
792 2018-05-22 22:26:33 So they don’t want oil but willing to go to court to fight to get oil. Makes sense 100%
793 2018-05-22 22:26:31 I have swamp land with mucho oil in West Texas.... I’ll sell it to you for 10 cents on the dollar !
794 2018-05-22 22:26:29 
795 2018-05-22 22:26:29 Really can't blame him, we had an election during the oil crash and it wasn't the number one topic. Instead, we had tribal bickering and a one issue candidate won. "Anti Kwarraptan"
796 2018-05-22 22:26:25 Of course not. I am saying the Useless Nations have prostitutes themselves for the Arab oil $$$. Seen who heads the Ins HRC?  I rest my case. It's obvious to intelligent people.
797 2018-05-22 22:26:17 I agree with the oil comment!  It has  been a major contributor to dissension and conflict! I disagree with your second comment regarding 9/11 .  It did not come from within the USA!
798 2018-05-22 22:26:00 かわいい
799 2018-05-22 22:25:47 Ah heck... doesn’t all the oil spills from the new drilling on OUR BLM land and coal dust do the trick to repel them?  That’s why your gouging our land for pennies in the acre... you’re just trying to protect us.I’ve been so dumb complaining about pollution, noise etc... silly me

802 2018-05-22 22:25:27 President TRUMP has lowered taxes, cut regulations, so why is gas getting so high !!!! Price gouging by oil companies!!!
803 2018-05-22 22:25:12 Oil price was low during campaigns. Buhari knew this and yet, he decided to run for office only to complain about this later. So irresponsible

805 2018-05-22 22:25:08 Sent hubby to the grocery store... I tried to be as specific as I could.... I asked for “Olive Oil spray” and he just says eff that and gets me canola oil spray!

807 2018-05-22 22:24:52 Does anybody find quantitive methods of diastology helpful at the bedside? Is this a thing I need to get into or can I tuck it into the category of "when I'm older"? Like donating to charity, and changing my own oil?
808 2018-05-22 22:24:50 How much for a full synthetic oil change on an M37? I bought my car there.
809 2018-05-22 22:24:49 costs now are $12/$15 per barrel at $30 dollars you are looking at 100% profit.

But the oil clock is running out, long before oil will, 2035 EU says no more diesel and petrol cars, so real peak oil 10 year decline, 20 year drops off cliff.

Norway has $1.1t in same time frame.

813 2018-05-22 22:24:13 Welcome to the trump economy 

It is just the beginning of the road down the rabbit hole

Hope you saved the huge tax cut you got to pay for the gas you need 

I am sure the oil companies will get richer
814 2018-05-22 22:24:09 I’m getting an oil change trying not to fall asleep. Wow
815 2018-05-22 22:24:06 Most of the people here missed that part.
816 2018-05-22 22:24:05 Is Investment in #cryptocurrencies are based out of sentiments?? if that is true $BTC may not see 52week high again for a long time, $oil could be the alternative for next few trend cycles
817 2018-05-22 22:24:04 Still need to work but it was getting late.  Skipped the pan sear on the pork tenderloin and just threw it in the oven with a coating of oil, salt, pepper, thyme, and parmesan.
818 2018-05-22 22:23:49 Don’t see, then, Russian adventures in Syria as an attempted restart of the resource-based prosperity and support Putin enjoyed last with high oil prices? Did we come up with a more reliable way to spike oil prices? Any escalation helps I’d imagine.
819 2018-05-22 22:23:49 BC's Lower Mainland doesn't want oil tankers or barges in their waters in case there's a spill. 

How has Vancouver Island got all their oil, gasoline and aviation fuel safely for decades then?

823 2018-05-22 22:23:35 Bernie used to bring up Venezuela all the time as a shining example of how great socialism was. There u had a country that had more oil than Saudi Arabia. Now their people are starving. He’s moved on now to Scandinavia.

825 2018-05-22 22:23:17 Lol. I’ll start charging money for my selfies. #Capitalism
826 2018-05-22 22:23:10 I’m not even mad at it honestly. I’m about to slather my hair in coconut oil & put a face mask on while I wait 
827 2018-05-22 22:23:08 You are writing as if you do not know that oil prices are going high all over the world. In USA the petrol rate has gone up by 15% in last one month. Are they going up in India only?
828 2018-05-22 22:23:00 Thank you Toni, there is a Mo shift on oil too daily/4hr
829 2018-05-22 22:22:59 Do you really think that if B.C. stops a pipeline that the world is just going to stop using oil? Get real.
830 2018-05-22 22:22:47 Dear @mishacollins Sir, I happen to know your snake oil is good for pretty much everything. You should maybe, as an act of random kindness, hand it out to sooth some of the severe burns you're delivering today. 

Ps. I fucking love you
831 2018-05-22 22:22:46 Another venture subsidized by Arab oil.
832 2018-05-22 22:22:45 First thing I’m dong when I get home is drowning myself in coconut oil
833 2018-05-22 22:22:34 O Lord thou Anoint my Head with the Oil of Gladness, and maketh me to receive Double in Favor and Success with all thy Glory shining upon me.
834 2018-05-22 22:22:31 Since when do gas prices go up based on the "risk" of oil prices going up. Why don't they wait till the oil prices go up. I don't put my prices up until the wholesale price goes up.
835 2018-05-22 22:22:23 I’ve tried coconut oil and Vaseline and windex lolll 
836 2018-05-22 22:22:21 Been there and through the Republic of Texas many times Rich!
837 2018-05-22 22:22:21 So if you actually cared about climate change; you should be pushing for more use of Alberta oil, not less.
838 2018-05-22 22:22:11 200% tax on cars wouldn’t pay for the short fall. Fuel is regular consumption. Cars are bought once in 5 years life cycle. 

Thing is - if international oil prices go up - some one has to pay for what one consumes. 

India still believes in govt control and entitlement
839 2018-05-22 22:22:06 I don't fuck around with stir fry sauce:

Soy sauce
Sesame oil
Oyster sauce
Brown sugar
Red pepper flakes
Garlic powder
Onion powder 
Ginger (powder)
Salt

840 2018-05-22 22:22:02 Changed mi oil now to rotate my tires :)
841 2018-05-22 22:21:50 qell one back in the 40s it was a hard process and 2nd after words do you think those with interest in oil.......
842 2018-05-22 22:21:16 Firstly, AB is the only heavy oil jurisdiction thats reducing the carbon-intensity of its oil. Global oil demand is set to increase for at-least the next 20 years. Refineries will have no choice but to take heavy oil with higher C-intensity if AB oil doesn’t have market access.
843 2018-05-22 22:21:14 It's past midnight and I got home to my mom watching YouTube recipe videos: 
"She does not know how to cook"

"Oh skip that bit we don't care about how you cut vegetables !"

"That's too much oil ! I know understand why these women are so fat..." 

THIS IS TOI GOOD
844 2018-05-22 22:21:06 You know some of your single male followers are praying for it right? But seriously, jump right on consolidating them and save on your monthly hit.
845 2018-05-22 22:21:00 Brace yourselves for an oil correction in June, which should be a buying opportunity imo. Also US$ should have a holiday for a month or so, good for short term risk assets and EM.
846 2018-05-22 22:20:55 This Shit Be Hard Bro I’m Tryna Remember To Oil My Scalp Every 3 Days
847 2018-05-22 22:20:46 The 72 resident killer whales face an existential threat if 7x the oil tanker traffic were to happen.  #onespill
848 2018-05-22 22:20:41 Just keeping divesting city money from oil and other biggies the enviro nazis hate like a good comrade.
849 2018-05-22 22:20:33 Came home and my brakes, oil and filters were changed with a full tank of gas 
850 2018-05-22 22:20:30 Selling our enviroment to the oil boys we see once again.
851 2018-05-22 22:20:25 Al-Qeada is Sunni
ISIS is Sunni
Boko Haram is Sunni
Al-Nusra is Sunni
All of the 9/11 Hijackers were Sunni

So why are we so obsessed with Shia Iran? I guess because the Sunnis have more oil & 1979 embassy hostage taking.
852 2018-05-22 22:20:11 Sour cream, coconut cream,  macadamia nuts and MCT oil added to low carb meals
853 2018-05-22 22:19:54 They go to a private school in the sierra nevadas.  They snowboard and ski.  Sugar bowl is a ski resort in the lake tahoe area.  Global warming is already effecting the sierras snowpack.  Yes only scientist paid by the oil industry dont believe in human inducted global warming.
854 2018-05-22 22:19:48 I feel so badass because I just opened the hood of my car to check what kind of oil I need and I got some black stuff on my hands
855 2018-05-22 22:19:37 I do not oppose this entirely, I believe the intention is wonderful, but I do wish to have clarification—what does this Bill do to keep terminally ill patients from falling victim to snake oil salesmen when the FDA is removed from the process? Can you kindly explain this? Thanks!
856 2018-05-22 22:19:28 You have mastered selfies obviously
857 2018-05-22 22:19:13 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
858 2018-05-22 22:18:28 I have a 44 year old son who worked most of the oil rigs in the gulf. Sham Rock I believe is the name of the place in Louisiana.
859 2018-05-22 22:18:25 whatever the objective was, Brock would be in danger.

So, for now, he let himself have this blissful moment. He let himself feel safe here in the warmth of his lover's skin.

"Can I..?"

He paused, pulling back and reaching for the bottle of rose-scented oil +
860 2018-05-22 22:18:23 I am a here and now person. The past is over so why dwell on it. The future hasn't been written yet so why worry about what may or not be? Just my perspective on things.

863 2018-05-22 22:17:57 Even if I did skip class I am still more intelligent than you. I know lower tax rates are good for everyone including you @MatthewKoontz4 . Unfortunately you are too stupid to know what is good for you.

865 2018-05-22 22:17:47 These amazing guitar capacitors are hot vacuum impregnated with pure castor oil then soldered and hand cast in oven-proof thermoplastic and finally hand painted for the perfect Bumble Bee look.
866 2018-05-22 22:17:40 My guy has oil and flax added to his feed and I curry him a lottttt.
867 2018-05-22 22:17:39 Weve been waiting long enough its the oil companies that have sent out propaganda for decades. Those companies knew for decades and did nothing! Now Rachel Notley is doing the same stalling. Theres no time left.
868 2018-05-22 22:17:35 Royalties... there I corrected it for you.
869 2018-05-22 22:17:33 Oil prices are hitting those top shelves again since 2014 and you Dismantling Bank Regulations on corrupt practices my gaawwdd when does this end America...
870 2018-05-22 22:17:32 The ThroBak Les Paul guitar wiring harness uses only the highest quality .022uf capacitors to connect the volume and tone pots.

872 2018-05-22 22:17:24 olive oil: 
Olive oil is a natural resource of vitamins and nutrients, all of which are needed for healthy hair growth. With regular application of olive oil, your eyelashes will get proper nourishment.
873 2018-05-22 22:17:23 Someone will just wake up and eat oil and spirogyra/algae with running stomach garnishing.... *spits*
874 2018-05-22 22:17:20 100/10 don’t recommend getting tea tree oil in your eye 
875 2018-05-22 22:17:12 Would I be right in thinking if production costs have halved & oil price is $80, in reality we’re talking about the equivalent price of about $100 a barrel or more?
876 2018-05-22 22:17:03 これが風邪を悪化させているとなぜ気づかない
877 2018-05-22 22:16:56 I worked for an oil company, we got fired if we didn't back into a parking spot. It's for safely when leaving, better vis. People queuing to get on planes really annoy me. Sit TF down and wait until there's only 5 there
878 2018-05-22 22:16:41 I guess the US bound tankers and the oil they carry magically respect international borders / lines on map right? And you would rather not see better spill response / safety measures for what’s existing?
879 2018-05-22 22:16:39 I have the Fig one in the bedroom and it seems strong enough to me and I’ve only turned the reeds once in the oil so far. I’ll ask the other half to confirm tho as I may just have preggo nose 
880 2018-05-22 22:16:32 Welcome to the inflation game. Who is going to benefit? Lenders, bankruptcy processors, and oil and gas alternatives like solar + electric cars.
881 2018-05-22 22:16:28 I read somewhere it was about €140m or so. Gambia can be a hub for entry into West Africa. It's well situated and has the advantage of being anglophone...
Don't discount oil and gas prospects within the country and even gold. It's not as poor as we think. #Gambia
882 2018-05-22 22:16:17 But you’re an oil bear, so nothing to worry about.
883 2018-05-22 22:16:13 "Ethical Oil" is a sign that someone has been watching too much Ezra and not thinking deeply enough...
884 2018-05-22 22:16:11 gotta get my oil changed, tires rotated & nails & toes done dis weekend lord have mercy on my wallet
885 2018-05-22 22:16:08 How many billions in subsidies?
886 2018-05-22 22:16:00 Also note that when extracts come in, there's a formula to equate concentrates to grams, so you'll only be allowed to have a few grams of hash or oil at a time.
887 2018-05-22 22:15:51 The two phases of wearing body oil:

Phase 1: “wow I am a toned, tanned, slippery goddess”

Phase 2 which occurs after sitting on the couch: thighs are covered in cat hair and crumbs from a granola bar eaten last week
888 2018-05-22 22:15:45 なんでこんなにヒジドラスが好き……っていうか泣きたくなるのかわからないんだけど、これはもしかしてドラスからのヒッジへの祝福(呪い)が母親から子供への願いに似ているからかもしれない……
889 2018-05-22 22:15:41 Does this include cannabis oil?
890 2018-05-22 22:15:39 I suspected as much. Our dear snake oil salesman truly is something else isn't he?
891 2018-05-22 22:15:34 Hate coming for oil changes 
892 2018-05-22 22:15:29 260 is a piss take tho for an oil change on a simple car like that. Ista d doesn't even communicate with it so that part of the service couldn't even be carried out by them. Unless they have some really old bit of dusty kit in a cupboard somewhere.
893 2018-05-22 22:15:22 *Scumbag* for sure.  One thing I return to is that nobody is owed a platform to peddle their snake oil.  He’s desperate for a platform and it’s only his followers screaming to give him one.

900 2018-05-22 22:15:01 I take it you haven’t read the news for a couple months? Otherwise this accusation makes no sense.

903 2018-05-22 22:14:40 what has become of the oil rich Venezuelan state should be a lesson ordinarily but Nigerian politicians will look the other way and pretend everything is going to be fine.
904 2018-05-22 22:14:28 @mmmhotbreakfast  I've had a beard for the best part of 8 years. I have beard oil that I use daily & a beard shampoo/conditioner I used 2/3 times a week. Currentyl, shortest it has been in about 12 months.

906 2018-05-22 22:14:15 The Onne seaport is mostly for oil servicing ships, govt need to do more to get the seaport in it full operational capacity. Do you need container ships to come, then may be you need to dredge the place to carry the likes of Maersk line ships, and that should be done.
907 2018-05-22 22:14:05 So what brand of cooking oil did you not have lol
908 2018-05-22 22:14:05 Probably because he has yet to follow through on any of his lofty promises. A visionary that doesn't get shit done is no better than a snake oil salesman.
909 2018-05-22 22:13:59 Tell us about your base....all 81 of them
910 2018-05-22 22:13:57 It’s different this time because of USA fracking. And once the dictators of Iran and Venezuela are overthrown and replaced with more democratic leaders, their oil will return to the market, thus bringing price down
911 2018-05-22 22:13:51 自転車だから傘させなくてびしょ濡れのんですけど！ww
912 2018-05-22 22:13:44 Trump knew he could fool some low income Americans with tax-scam crumbs that would be net negative once Iran oil left the marketplace and Russia stepped up oil supply for increased demand. Making Russia Great Again!
913 2018-05-22 22:13:32 Chelsea. Stop the oil money spread
914 2018-05-22 22:13:25 So much else wrong with that tweet too, subsidy mostly went to oil and gas (trillions per year actually as we all know from IMF reports) and bailing out GM when it went bankrupt the first (and probably not last) time. Solar and electric cars can stand on their own feet 0 subsidy
915 2018-05-22 22:13:16 He’s reverse engineering this.
916 2018-05-22 22:13:12 Yeah that'd help with your backpain !  I used to get the oil. Couple of drops under the tongue and the pain turns to

921 2018-05-22 22:12:55 When BP adopted it’s now scrapped “beyond petroleum” slogan it attracted a whole load of “horribly idealistic, green graduates who caused chaos with their ideas”, an old BP veteran once told me with obvious disgust...so yes beware oil cos what you wish for..
922 2018-05-22 22:12:50 These sex trafficking scares at walmarts around us got me fright. Im not even wanting to go pick up my oil  alone because of it, disgusting I have to be afraid of that.
923 2018-05-22 22:12:40 Castor oil: 
Castor oil is great for growing out eyelashes, as well and your hair too. 
The antioxidants in castor oil also support the keratin in hair and help make hair stronger, smoother, and help it grow.
924 2018-05-22 22:12:34 Then get a oil change
925 2018-05-22 22:12:31 I’m very happy with Trump!!!
926 2018-05-22 22:12:18 But there’s something even deeper here it seems. Beyond Pruitt’s antics. Something more dire I sense. Like he’s the gatekeeper to something far more terrible. Beyond pollution, pesticides, fracking, oil, waste, etc.

Who are his counterparts in Russia & China?
927 2018-05-22 22:12:14 Of all the colours in the world that I have loved over the years, the pink of a sunny-side up egg bathed in hot oil is the most beautiful. Fear not though blue, you are still my childhood favourite.

934 2018-05-22 22:11:40 Just washing my bedding& then oil be online 
935 2018-05-22 22:11:37 Is there also an argument that most pre-996 are really more oil-cooled than air-cooled, given the large amount of oil in the system, and the oil coolers.
936 2018-05-22 22:11:26 Everyone knows that the people voted overwhelmingly 
for reunification! Putin's wishes were irrelevant!
if you are ignoring that fact you aren't paying attention.
The US doesn't care what people want, it's all about 
The oil companies & war profiteers!
937 2018-05-22 22:11:21 I would love for unity to flip the trending a bit to get our message out!!!
938 2018-05-22 22:11:21 how do y’all have so much time to love yourselves? like I’m trying to eat healthy, exercise, read more, oil pull, wash my face at night, moisturize, meditate, call my old heads regularly (grandparents), grow a garden and be more positive. shit is tiring lol.

943 2018-05-22 22:10:48 [puzzles for a second for anti-white condiment stance, shrugs] then I definitely have no idea what your problem is. Consult Kevin's list. If you are making stuff at home, don't forget to infuse the spices in hot oil, with a bit of caution when it comes to chillies.
944 2018-05-22 22:10:42 Oooh the office store in town has a bunch more art stuff now, including canvas, brushes and oil paints 
945 2018-05-22 22:10:35 Oh and put a few drops of eucalyptus oil (or olbas) in the bottom of the shower before you take one. Really helps!
946 2018-05-22 22:10:26 Why are we having high fuel prices if we are producing our own oil please explain tjat to the american people,especially seniors on fixed income.

948 2018-05-22 22:10:12 Just misread "tin of oil" on the shopping list as "tin of evil". Must get to the Cthulu supermarket more often.
949 2018-05-22 22:10:10 RT @LivingSafely: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this May? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
950 2018-05-22 22:10:10 Dumb Fact. Anybody who knows about International oil prices would know that. Better is to not waste money on stupid socialist programs & reduce prices

957 2018-05-22 22:09:26 She commented that BC is suing Alberta because they want their oil. But they also don't want their oil. And the zinger "So that happened" was just spot on. 

I'll try to find a clip.
958 2018-05-22 22:09:24 A friend n I like to talk about climate change in a resturant or cafe so ppl will hear. Reactions vary but one got an oil worker angry things got a bit heated.
959 2018-05-22 22:09:18 I was watching on my tablet while my car was getting an oil change. Great minds think alike
960 2018-05-22 22:08:59 I chuckle at how so many are going on at great length about the exodus in Toronto. Shanahan's plan was to give Dubas the keys to the car. With that being the case, why would anyone have expected the other two to remain with the Maple Leafs once the shift was made? Silly.
961 2018-05-22 22:08:56 Everything from cleaning house to my face! Love  @beachwoodessent an oil for everything!
962 2018-05-22 22:08:43 Listen. I've worked in the film business in several ways and many of the "jokes" in his videos are legitimate complaints. Especially when he talks about continuity errors, very obvious costume problems, and plot holes so big you could fit an oil tanker through them.

964 2018-05-22 22:08:38 strange folks at the helm in B.C. they want to restict amount of oil coming in through the pipelines themselves  but when Alberta says they will restict it,  then they sue. too much smoke from the green stuff must have hit Victoria.
965 2018-05-22 22:08:34 5 things Colonizers respect are MONEY, INTELLIGENCE, NATURAL RESOURCES, ECONOMY, POWERFUL MILITARY. 
Their true GOD = Gold Oil Drugs. 
GREED IS EMBEDDED in their Blood. And they think with their REPTILIAN BRAIN.
They don't stop, until you've got those 5 things above THEY RESPECT
966 2018-05-22 22:08:20 I’m devastated,, I’m so stupid. I didn’t check my pockets before doing my laundry and my brand new @ultabeauty juice infused lip oil got washed and rUINED. Don’t be a booboo the fool like me, check your pockets

978 2018-05-22 22:05:57 While I appreciate your approach to lawmaking I worry that this law will leave room for unscrupulous people hawking snake oil to prey on desperate patients.
979 2018-05-22 22:05:56 Ummm...The PC's ran this province into the ground once Oil crashed and didn't know how to govern.  The NDP has brought us back in a lot quicker time than expected.  All the while not cutting any public sector jobs.  Now leading the country in growth.
980 2018-05-22 22:05:46 Is this how I’m supposed to pay off my debt? I was thinking of just not eating for the next 60 years...

982 2018-05-22 22:05:26 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
983 2018-05-22 22:05:24 When oil went south a LOT of upper-earners in AB got a very rude awakening. People living off credit, with big $$$ monthly payments. Industry busted for a while and many were unable to fend off creditors, losing homes, cars, etc. That's not a party's fault - that's industry/econ.
984 2018-05-22 22:05:20 Good thing the oil change guy didnt call in sick
985 2018-05-22 22:05:05 With limited consumer protections, on our way to another financial crash.  Trump giving big corporations, incl. banks, all the benefits, consumers nothing.  Yes, economy strong but inflation, health care, oil will cancel middle/lower income gains.
986 2018-05-22 22:05:03 I though BC got gas & oil from Washington
987 2018-05-22 22:05:02 The world is too dependant on the cheaper carbon fuel. If other cheaper  alternatives were feasable it will happen  but not until the world runs out of oil.

991 2018-05-22 22:04:11 We all have that one jar of coconut oil used solely for sex purposes, right??!
992 2018-05-22 22:04:06 That's my point, no need to go down that road again. Also, part of the reason Nelson left was b/c he wanted to be a head coach, not exactly sure how coming back to Edmonton to be an AC makes sense for him.
993 2018-05-22 22:04:04 Please be informed that Services 157, 174 and 506 are being diverted with 3 bus stops skipped along Bukit Batok West Ave 3 due to an oil spillage.

999 2018-05-22 22:03:14 I hate to say but unless something comes out of the Muller investigation we are royally screwed. Banking gone. Oil gas gone, the funny thing is they did it with the help of willfully ignorant that were fed,Fear and coded racism. They are gluttons at the buffet.
1000 2018-05-22 22:03:02 Yes, they should shut off the taps. And, by "Washington" they actually mean Alaska oil, being tankered down the BC coast...  thought That was Horgan s worst nighmare?!
1001 2018-05-22 22:02:56 You are an ignorant asshole. Crude oil prices fluxuate constantly for many, many different reasons.

1006 2018-05-22 22:02:20 I don't disagree at all but like i said, until something actually happens, i am going to leave it at that. 
I do not listen or believe any of the media rumors either.
1007 2018-05-22 22:02:16 When you vote, don’t vote, don’t debate, you don’t stand up for women/LGTBQ+/education/AHS/environment; you only stand with your Albertans.

That's why you won't get real love...  Using oil and your hands it's useless
1012 2018-05-22 22:01:21 Because the team has done soOoOo many other things that “weren’t a good look”  

They re-hired MacT, Howson etc. Nelson was competent in his role, was an oversight to let him go in favour of Eakins. As an AC might be a good add.
1013 2018-05-22 22:00:59 I can’t wait to get an tan like I put oil on everyday lol I love the golden dark skin.

1025 2018-05-22 21:59:48 I agree, some seriously ill people will clasp at straws and try the stuff just because they heard about it on Dr Phil. Jillian Denies should have a class action suit or whatever to stop her from selling her Snake Oil before someone get seriously hurt by this.

1029 2018-05-22 21:59:33 Trump’s doing it indirectly through secret deals he made with the Saudis & in turn, OPEC. 

Besides the huge weapons & business deals that he made whilst on his first foreign trip I’m sure he sneaked in some oil & gas deals without telling anyone.
1030 2018-05-22 21:59:32 A little olive oil and soap does the trick nicely 
1031 2018-05-22 21:59:30 Have you found oil?
1032 2018-05-22 21:59:29 I hope one day all my vowels and consonants can be colours in a retro oil slide machine light show
1033 2018-05-22 21:59:26 There's no future in ANY country's oil industry.
But there's money to be made until at least 2050.
But oil had only ever been a bonus, Scotland is perfectly capable of existing without it.
1034 2018-05-22 21:59:25 Harry, he’ll do it anyway because that’s what his ExxonMobil execs want; so oil prices increase and their Artic drillling becomes cost effective. It’s the Economy stupid; doesn’t work @ <$120 per barrel
1035 2018-05-22 21:59:22 You thought you were 'engineer smart'. Turns out you're only 'change my oil smart'.

1036 2018-05-22 21:59:10 Why would anyone trust this man with one of your most vital natural resources needed to survive. You don’t need oil or coal to live.

1047 2018-05-22 21:57:42 Took my hubby 6 months to find a job after being laid off in the oil/gas sector, not in oil and gas right now thanks to the dithering of Notley and their anti-Alberta rhetoric.
1048 2018-05-22 21:57:40 Wow, I will do it for 255 

Really just for an oil change with some old 10w40s.
Got to pay for all that marble flooring and coffee machines somehow tho.

1050 2018-05-22 21:57:36 How can Buhari claim that oil price stood still at $100 per barrel fo 16yrs PDP was in power. In 1999 when Obasanjo took over, oil price was around  $9- $12per barrel.
Buhari indeed is an olodo.

1062 2018-05-22 21:55:58 Now how is that possible especially we are "self-sufficient" now when it comes to oil and gas. We even "export" it now, remember? But then - you did get a huge tax cut so you can afford higher gas prices. Naivete - look it up.
1063 2018-05-22 21:55:44 EVERYTHING dictated by economics. This very argument is now, more $.   You can have values and demand value/accountability at same time.

1079 2018-05-22 21:53:33 I don't think many people are concerned about the plant being "destroyed;" they are concerned about their safety, health and environment.  PGV operates with the same disregard for life as most oil & gas corporations.....
1080 2018-05-22 21:53:30 Just had the best, relaxing bath. Practically bathed in tea tree oil. Opened up my pores and sinuses and it was so hot that steam is still appearing off my skin. 
1081 2018-05-22 21:53:27 With Starbucks being a far left leaning liberal,.their should have no problem with open restrooms for all, maybe they'll add some gender fluid restroom,.even trannies need to check their oil.

1084 2018-05-22 21:53:12 Believe me, I don't worry about anything the club does, as it has zero to do with my day-to-day existence. However, from the players & fans standpoint, it would suck to see another asset go for less than full value and make the team's club back to the top all the more difficult.

1090 2018-05-22 21:52:37 There must be some form of alternate energy that can immediately replace what BC cannot get from Alberta. Getting oil from Washington State does not count, right?

1093 2018-05-22 21:52:14 Since some of these are things most hunters just don't do, we have some suspicions in terms of better 'preparing' what's legally a nature preserve to be more accommodating for oil company use. Harder to work on pipelines, etc. with bears about.
1094 2018-05-22 21:52:09 I thought you were gonna say because of the oil incident 
1095 2018-05-22 21:51:56 Some of this "high performance sport supplement" shit sounds like major snake oil to me.
1096 2018-05-22 21:51:53 For the #history:
@realDonaldTrump is blowing up #Opec and you are regulating this madness. 
Q1: 2T$ Valuation of #Aramco is based on what?
Q2: 2T$ is the amount for investments which boosting that growth. Why all numbers are go just fine?
Q3: Production of #shale_oil in 2023?
1097 2018-05-22 21:51:48 If you had more oil where you're at we would have already saved you 

Sorry I don't run this bitch I would have fixed this problem for you in the middle of the night and been gone before sunrise
1098 2018-05-22 21:51:38 —oranges!
           -peel an orange and use the peel, rub the peel on your teeth for about 5 mins
           -don’t do it all the time, the acid on the peel can ruin your enamel
—clove oil!
           -every morning when brushing your teeth out 2-3 drops of oil on your brush
1099 2018-05-22 21:51:33 We just published a post on our website about the use of CBD oil in treating IBS, as it reduces anxiety and acts as an anti-spasmodic - it might be of use to you if you give it a read
1100 2018-05-22 21:51:32 Alfie Evans didn’t even have experimental snake oil to try, there was literally no treatment anywhere.
1101 2018-05-22 21:51:28 PS I doubt if Mr Trump needs pro bono Attorney's. However I do welcome the new Special Investigator to look into his claims of campaign rigging  privacy issues.  This will hopefully satisfy his claims of such. Since he won the election. This would be a first.
1102 2018-05-22 21:51:24 The day we know that oil will practically run out within 25 years will be a great day and drive huge innovation in renewable energy , esp from the sun. Batteries will need improving too as they are eating up lithium
1103 2018-05-22 21:51:17 If it can help annihilate the oil industry, I will.
1104 2018-05-22 21:51:12 Point one allegation. Petroleum minister without oil well. Vote @MBuhari
1105 2018-05-22 21:51:11 Hi Daveyboy, government proposals in cuts for oil exploration has absolutely nothing to do with Z, and it has nothing to do differences in price between regions either. Rental cost differences play a relatively small part in overall price; when was the 'last time' you asked? ^MZ
1106 2018-05-22 21:51:05 5 things Colonizers respect are MONEY, INTELLIGENCE, NATURAL RESOURCES, ECONOMY, POWERFUL MILITARY. 
Their true GOD = Gold Oil Drugs. 
GREED IS EMBEDDED in their Blood. And they think with their REPTILIAN BRAIN.
They don't stop, until you've got those 5 things above THEY RESPECT
1107 2018-05-22 21:50:55 Ask yourself... Why would Russia want Trump? He’s rebuilding our military, putting harsh sanctions on Russia, making us a natural gas and oil exporter, and smashing Putin’s allies in the Middle East. Meanwhile, Hillary was Pay-For-Play.

1113 2018-05-22 21:49:47 Trump chose to help Putin get $5B in the oil sale after Obama had sanctioned Russia bigly. Pretty much treason right there. But hey Donnie made $500 mil himself so it was worth it. Putin helped sway the election. Fair deal.
1114 2018-05-22 21:49:40 .. if only Canada had their own oil supply somewhere .. lol

1117 2018-05-22 21:49:23 For example, if the market crashes and all your money is in a gold precious metal ETF like $GLD, you're safe and probably profited from the crash, as gold is a good hedge vs the dollar(non commodity stocks ie anything not metal, oil, etc). $SLV is silver fund.

1119 2018-05-22 21:48:45 @CBC Vassy thinks it's funny that BC is suing AB to keep their oil flowing but trying at the same time to stop their oil flowing. Vassy, it is not 'oil' BC is concerned about, It's 'diluted bitumen'. Please learn the difference before you chuckle again.

1121 2018-05-22 21:48:36 Before it didn't matter that KSA had stupid leadership, but now  faces existential crisis because of it as oil revenues will fade faster than expected.
1122 2018-05-22 21:48:16 Well I use the carrot oil soap because I have issues with hyper-pigmentation. So we all might have some issue. 
1123 2018-05-22 21:48:09 I hope he will cover why Amazon is suggesting Emu oil to me .Arnicare gel
1124 2018-05-22 21:48:01 I think Alberta is asserting that B.C. isn’t following the Charter by stopping the pipeline. If they’re going to shut off the oil without following the law it makes their own case shaky
1125 2018-05-22 21:47:45 الحمد لله
1126 2018-05-22 21:47:41 2) The transition is on. It's a shame we are still burning oil. That's its lowest possible use. Auto sector focused on selling trucks and SUV's just as oil prices rise again. Transportation is key sector for EVs trucks (fleets)  busses. The transition is slow. 3)..
1127 2018-05-22 21:47:38 @VinTinWelding Hi. I love a towel ring you make, but am unsure about what finishes "patina" and "Oil rubbed" are. Could you please explain to me? TYVM
1128 2018-05-22 21:47:32 I wonder: how would you describe the current surge in oil prices and its underlying cause? Would you assess this surge as one of physical supply and demand too?
1129 2018-05-22 21:47:30 Unfortunately oil never runs out it’s all a big lie !!! The big book will tell you how this plays out !!!

1132 2018-05-22 21:47:23 Just paid 93 dollars for an oil change, fml I’m really tired of this adult stuff already.
1133 2018-05-22 21:47:23 I agree, I didn't say they would persist indefinitely nor did I say you should trade based off them - they vary. Its helpful though to know how assets are moving in relation to one another over the short-term though. I had it at the back of my mind when trading SPX and oil today
1134 2018-05-22 21:47:18 If they’re nice and thin, fry them up with a generous portion of olive oil. Get yourself some shiitake mushrooms in there with some rosemary, sea salt and pepper. Side with a baguette and cheese for all your protein needs.

1141 2018-05-22 21:46:14 @Enterprise Help! We rented a car for our honeymoon and we’re still in the begining of our cross country trip and a light came on telling us we need to change the oil. What do we do?
1142 2018-05-22 21:46:14 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
1143 2018-05-22 21:46:11 I haven't read any of your tweets or articles in months Rob so i cannot respond to that. What i will say is i personally am not going to worry about any of that other stuff you are concerned about. Unless something actually happens, i see no point in worrying
1144 2018-05-22 21:46:11 Well I have kinda rough skin! And being so far north now, I had to stay inside all winter and my skin didn’t like the lack of sunlight, being Mediterranean. All that oil that I naturally produce just sits in the pores. It really helps with those little stubborn bacne

1147 2018-05-22 21:45:55 I totally with Rachel Notley decision not to go to the Premiers conference and defending Alberta’s rights to a fair market place for our oil.
@RachelNotley @PnPCBC.... where our glorious leader. JT?

1152 2018-05-22 21:45:34 Do... do we think that's what the oil was for?

1165 2018-05-22 21:44:05 I grew up on Canvey Island, and this (combined with the huge oil refinery) made for a reassuringly consistent sense of impending doom.
1166 2018-05-22 21:43:58 Not saying the tweet is inaccurate. My take there's a nuance to it. That the transition is happening in lock step with the sustaining of oil/gas. The difference between you and Peter, is he puts a lot of other people's money, behind his research. That's not disparaging 2)...
1167 2018-05-22 21:43:55 #drphil  That lady is a dangerous sociopath and shows no concern that people were injured by her snake oil claims.   I hope someone sues her and forces her to stop before this gets worse.
1168 2018-05-22 21:43:52 It has come to the point in our country's thought process, where our  Constitution, and the defence of it,  is now being looked upon as partisan. The ACLU a leftist leaning group?Minority's rights are generally the group's being infringed upon. Check your privilege?

1172 2018-05-22 21:43:12 Maybe in the last century but Islamic countries have always been like this since the dawn of Islam, to suggest the people haven’t progressed because nations rivaling over the oil is absurd. That should have no impact as to why they treat women like slaves
1173 2018-05-22 21:42:53 Well for one if the use canola oil replace it with olive/coconut oil ... salt well I got on my parents about that ... switch their salt to pink sea salt

1180 2018-05-22 21:41:45 So the snake oil salesmen will actually be able to sell snake oil?
1181 2018-05-22 21:41:44 Orwellian doublespeak. America bought the worst kind of snake oil from the worst kind of snake oil salesman and yet somehow he's got you all as repeat customers. I thank the lucky stars every day I do not live in America
1182 2018-05-22 21:41:37 Hopefully oil sanctions, but we rely alot on heating oil from Venezuela to keep prices down in the northeast, so don't see it happening.

1190 2018-05-22 21:41:18 Let's get this straight!. BC does not want Alberta oil. Then BC sues Alberta for not sending it oil. Then you ask me why I insist Canada is smaller than its sum parts.
1191 2018-05-22 21:41:14 But what if it is not a huge issue?!!! The chemicals in the vape cartridges give me anxiety so now I have to double me CBD oil. Big $$$$$ for someone off the back of poor Epileptics.

1196 2018-05-22 21:40:37 @DefraGovUK gas, oil, solar panels? The latter are still too expensive. Also why no mention on air travel? Seems like the report is yet again another knee jerk reaction that hits the poorest in society 2/

1198 2018-05-22 21:40:24 theyll make sure to properly oil that up too~
1199 2018-05-22 21:40:24 So much for staying out of politics  But you know what? I don’t care. I want to see more green energy options in BC because it’s better for our environment. We won’t be “Beautiful British Columbia” after an oil spill. Guess we’ll have to change our license plates.
1200 2018-05-22 21:40:23 @PnPCBC  why cant you differentiate between oil and diluted bitumen?
1201 2018-05-22 21:40:19 I didn't understand the economics of #bjp clowns; when crude oil prices go up, patrol prices go up but when crude oil price go down, why patrol prices still go up? Can any bjp clown explain?

1203 2018-05-22 21:40:12 Doesnt' this absence of laws and lines put you in a defensive position despite the good earnings and rosy numbers? Just one of these Trump Jenga blocks disintegrates (Deutsche, UAE, Qatar, Oil, Money laundering) and the whole tower falls down... again.
1204 2018-05-22 21:40:07 I'd say the biggest reason for the stick is because a large vocal portion of Alberta doesn't want to change things. Realistically though? It has to happen at some point when the oil eventually runs out years down the road. Better to be somewhat prepared or working there (1)
1205 2018-05-22 21:40:01 Baby oil, rub them in at the glue
1206 2018-05-22 21:40:00 I used the face oil and I love it!! Doesn’t help much with brightening scars and breakout, but it does make my skin glow and makeup application better
1207 2018-05-22 21:40:00 This is irresponsible journalism. You know very well oil is purchased on international markets. Governments are simply there to operate the books meaning No Tax equates to No Spending. Book need to be balanced. I am sure you know this, too.

Again Premier Notley...you don't get it.  Canadians want your oil and gas.  We don't want your bitumen.  It is toxic for the environment and will ruin any chance of Canada making its climate commitments.

1215 2018-05-22 21:39:17 Correlations don't add a lot of value in one's analytical tool kit because they disappear when you depend on them most. And this correlation between $USD and $OIL is bound to disappear in short order because it isn't logical
1216 2018-05-22 21:39:12 If I purchased everything that Jiffy Lube says I needed changed, my oil change would go from $49.99 to $450
1217 2018-05-22 21:39:11 Yeah, I know people want him in the 3’s, but if you look at the comparable, that’s just not realistic.

1221 2018-05-22 21:38:53 Ya know what really hurts? The price of Olive Oil.
1222 2018-05-22 21:38:49 Failing to take on the economic system means sanctioning the continued unsustainable plunder of forests for palm oil plantations, intensive farming, habitat destruction, pollution, mining, poaching etc. All of that is simply resource competition, human nature, how life works.3/3

1231 2018-05-22 21:37:21 How can Buhari claim that oil price stood still at $100 per barrel fo 16yrs PDP was in power. In 1999 when Obasanjo took over, oil price was around  $18-$20 per barrel.
Buhari indeed is an olodo, a classical itiboribo of no equal!
1232 2018-05-22 21:37:15 I keep seeing this stuff on fb that makes you gain weight but idk if I want to try that shit it’s like drinking oil and I’m not fucking with it.

1235 2018-05-22 21:37:08 As I said, the middle eastern countries have been historically owned by western powers like Britain who used them for oil and didn’t allow them to develop. And women in Islam don’t see what they wear as oppression, they see it as protecting their modesty and it is their choice

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
1238 2018-05-22 21:37:02 Let's recall what the PCs did to Alberta! Deficits with $100 oil, and no savings after 40 years. They were so bad their own members voted the party out of exiatence! Ontario can't afford the PCs! #Change4Better @AndreaHorwath @OntarioNDP
1239 2018-05-22 21:36:41 They were very shiny and warm.  Doggo likes her eyes.

Does she smell like oil or gas?  That may put the dog off a bit.

1242 2018-05-22 21:35:57 hehe i just drink water and use coconut oil 
1243 2018-05-22 21:35:42 Sometimes the reed diffuser in my lounge randomly sends out a mega waft of whatever oil is currently in situ (it's Mediterranean orange at present). No rhyme or reason to it, simply a burst of aroma without warning #MYSTERY

1245 2018-05-22 21:35:37 I was in Kolkata and I think i can surpass US demand for oil for a year
1246 2018-05-22 21:35:30 With LLS $6 higher than WTI. Pipeline tariffs are $1.5-$3.0. The WTI longs give refiners $3 for no reason? Why? Because if WTI moves up the L/S trade that's gone horribly wrong will get worse. Knowing the game is key to trading oil and why it sells off after midday #OOTT

1248 2018-05-22 21:35:21 My mom asked me if I wanted kale and I told her she could make it for me with some lemon and olive oil and she freaked out  “we cook the black people way with seasoning up in here”
1249 2018-05-22 21:35:18 I don’t want mayo flavored ice cream but I think adding it to ice cream base might be a cool idea. It would make the ice cream extremely creamy and rich. It’s basically eggs and oil. Eggs and fat are what helps make ice cream so creamy. Food science.
1250 2018-05-22 21:35:13 “Ey, I’m in the taxi business!  Like sanitation and the olive oil business!”
1251 2018-05-22 21:35:12 I’m always attracted totakes which buck and/or attack the conventional wisdom. And yet I’m conversant with the conventional wisdom in essentially no field. Which makes me especially susceptible to intellectual equivalents of snake oil.
1252 2018-05-22 21:35:11 RT @LivingSafely: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this May? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
1253 2018-05-22 21:35:04 But seriously, if dry skin mo, your pores will work double time to produce more oil. More oil = pimples. If you dont use sunblock = hyperpigmentation, sun spots, etc. the UV rays breaks your skin barrier. 
1254 2018-05-22 21:34:57 "You do have a point... Guess it is pretty to convince humans otherwise." He strolls back into the aisle for a couple of oatmeal containers. "Couple pounds of meat and a few different spices. We have any oil at the house?"
1255 2018-05-22 21:34:53 Drunk elephant’s whipped cream and the ordinary’s marula oil to set everything in afterwards
1256 2018-05-22 21:34:48 we both know that "tar sands" is the attempt to be derogatory - oil sands is what they are known as.  BUT - be juvenile/pedantic/nasty - and tar sands away - cause it makes you feel good - and allows you to be part of the hate Canada gang.
1257 2018-05-22 21:34:38 I recall that every penny increase in the gasoline price is about $1B per year (someone with later data can confirm this). In any case, the effect of rising oil prices on household budgets and the economy is large.

1259 2018-05-22 21:34:30 Can u check the financial statements of Oil companies in lasg few years, we can get the losses carried forward.
1260 2018-05-22 21:34:29 Can't bring worse than the Alberta PCs! They ran deficits with $100 oil, and saved NOTHING after 40 yrs. They were so bad their own membership voted the party out of existence. LOL.
1261 2018-05-22 21:34:21 Nick, a cmdty q interessa ao Parente não é o petroleo. Agora a cmdty dele é o milho (um pouquinho de soja, sorgo). Ele tem q olhar p isto pq o pessoal da BRFS entende bulhufas do game. Unica coisa de OIL que interessa a Parente agora é diesel devido a frete lasanha, frango, pizza

1263 2018-05-22 21:34:11 #Trumps is all about smoke and mirrors. In the old days, @realDonaldTrump would be described an a snake oil salesman. Don't believe his hype.
1264 2018-05-22 21:34:10 When asked what currency that an independent Scotland will use, just tell them ...

"The same currency that you will use to buy our oil"

#YouYesYet #ScotRef #IndyRef2
1265 2018-05-22 21:34:09 Again, I'm neutral on this issue. I just don't take the oil company at its word. My Gawd, who would. They lie like a Trump, lol
1266 2018-05-22 21:34:08 venezeula's pretty screwed economically unless they can really quickly develop some refinery capacity to take advantage of 80$ oil. how patient is china really going to be with them?
1267 2018-05-22 21:34:07 I can also recommend the Avon Skin So Soft dry oil. Smells great, midges HATE the ingredients and the oil base stops them from being able to penetrate the skin... oh and it is also mega cheap 
1268 2018-05-22 21:34:00 Have had SUCH a productive day telling people about the huge benefits seen with our oil! From Wholesale to Really Great Friends Needing Help.  Really loving this.... and feel very blessed to be a part of it and part of something so wonderful that is literally helping millions!
1269 2018-05-22 21:33:42 A bhakt told me, that reason for higher taxes is - during UPA losses by Oil companies were carried forward. N Modi is trying to repay those debts
As far as I remember annual losses during 2009 were around 2k crores. N recently Chidambaram pointed out govt earned 3L crore in 2 qtr
1270 2018-05-22 21:33:26 Should I change my oil rn or should I go tomorrow

1273 2018-05-22 21:33:12 It’ll still be Obama’s fault because he sanctioned Russia’s $500.00billions of oil development by exon mobile corporation! Remember!

1293 2018-05-22 21:31:53 A libertarian group funded by the Koch Brothers stumping for the oil industry and limited environmental oversight=counterpoint to liberal bias.
This is going to get worse before it gets better.
1294 2018-05-22 21:31:48 Restricting bitumen imports has to do with protecting the BC coast's environment and industries. Restricting oil flow to BC has to do with punishing another province by trying to force them to support a dying industry at their expense. Not the same.

1298 2018-05-22 21:31:21 The economic collapse began in 2013. Sanctions didn't begin until 2017. And the US is still the #1 buyer of Venezuelan oil.
1299 2018-05-22 21:31:07 I find it funny when people protest pipelines, yet don’t protest oil on a daily basis. If you wanna change the environment you don’t start by ruining the economy and detouring investors.
1300 2018-05-22 21:31:07 It's ironic , UK coming out the EU , USA pulling up with Trade sanctions on us and the EU . The Iran people now will be left starving Like the Yemen , all for control and Oil rights .

We pay higher petrol and diesel prices due to tax, not profit.

1312 2018-05-22 21:30:01 Thanks for taking the time to reach out! As stated in the "engine oil consumption" section of your owner's manual, using 1 quart per 1,200 miles would be considered normal. New vehicles may consume more oil over the first 3,000 miles, however. - JN
1313 2018-05-22 21:29:55 Domanda: all'inizio del secolo scorso Standard Oil divenne così potente e tentacolare da essere smembrata per legge. Potrebbe succedere per una società digitale (qualcuno ha detto Facebook?)?
1314 2018-05-22 21:29:48 LoL The day BC cuts of the Alberta  Oil/Gas the pipeline that supplies 90’/, to the lower mainland & drives up gas prices to $5.oo pr Ltr...,Albertans would be ecstatic. Horgan is just insane enough to do it. Here’s hoping he saves Alberta the trouble.
1315 2018-05-22 21:29:39 I like to think it's contracting "anus oil" rather than "anus 'ole", the latter option is far far too silly.

Premiers Notley and Moe ..you don't get it.  Canadians want your oil and gas.  We don't want your bitumen.  It is toxic for the environment and will ruin any chance of Canada making its climate commitments.

1319 2018-05-22 21:28:59 Every time I go and get my oil changed they tell me something new is wrong and I’m just like how sway!

1327 2018-05-22 21:28:01 Now when we impose sanctions on Iran and Venezuela which pushes up oil prices. Enough to show up in the CPI, data leading the Fed to raise rates too quickly. Brace for landing folks.

No amount of aloe, coconut oil or cocoa butter could ease that pain. My skin’s crawling just thinking about it.

1359 2018-05-22 21:23:38 Listen to what you are saying, lol. You want us to ship our oil and buy foreign oil! Build a dang refinery!
1360 2018-05-22 21:23:23 Can we just start buying our oil from Russia and get back to cheap gas prices?

1362 2018-05-22 21:23:21 Try taking evening primrose oil pills for 5-10 days before it comes next month. It doesn’t take them away but they’re way more manageable.
1363 2018-05-22 21:23:19 This is history repeating. The equine equivalent of The Trail of Tears. Choctaw. 
Nationwide wild horses that should be protected are being redefined as trespass, hunted & fed into the horse slaughter pipeline. Our “representatives” are representing cattle and oil.
1364 2018-05-22 21:23:18 Except when compared to the snake oil salesman who heads Alberta's opposition.
1365 2018-05-22 21:23:17 In desperation with my gas turning off I cooked noodles in a vegetable steamer (no water, little oil in the bottom) and it worked and I'm ashamed
1366 2018-05-22 21:23:07 BC Govt: Do you want Alberta oil or do you not want Alberta oil? If you want it, then stop threatening to block it. It's that simple. You started this whole, confusing mess.
1367 2018-05-22 21:23:01 I just heard President@Buhari saying crude oil price  was $100 and above during 16yrs of Pdp rule, baba that is a lie from the pit of hell
1368 2018-05-22 21:22:59 Elon Musk isn't a snake oil salesman. Is a musk oil salesman (that way, he can claim to have invented it).
1369 2018-05-22 21:22:53 - i need him to do my oil changes

1372 2018-05-22 21:22:40 Average Teacher pay based on 12 months work is $73,000 a yr. Only reason average is 50 grand +benefits, 9 month school yr. Yrs pay in 9 mo?
1373 2018-05-22 21:22:29 Why are we even putting sanctions on Venezuela in the first place? 

Can't we just be honest, & admit, globalist imperialism will never let a sovereign nation, with that much oil, govern themselves.

#americafirst ?
1374 2018-05-22 21:22:29  what is even happening in this tweet..
1375 2018-05-22 21:22:12 Again, you don't understand the treaty process.
You never responded to the refinery question. Why not keep our oil at home? No need to buy oil or export it when we need it. Ship it so a texas Co. makes billions. Doesn't make sense
1376 2018-05-22 21:22:08 You are truly blessed. He’s a TV doctor currently under investigation for selling snake oil
1377 2018-05-22 21:22:07 Is a barrel of oil at $145us yet? That's what was at when we were paying $1.65p/l 10yrs ago. @kochie_online @sunriseon7
1378 2018-05-22 21:21:53 How about a fetish for kicking slightly burnt oil spills under cars, not bad, right?
1379 2018-05-22 21:21:51 but our small corner of rural PA it's helping keep our oil refinery afloat, and all the myriad jobs and local economies related, right down to our struggling hospital and schools. Tiny bit of goodness.

1394 2018-05-22 21:19:40 If you want strong teeth for kids & adults put raw cacao powder into mouth (or chew cacao nibs) & leave it there. 
Theobromine in it forms a protective bond on enamel surface 6+ times stronger than dentists fluoride application. Then coconut oil to aid dental flora. Not for dogs!
1395 2018-05-22 21:19:37 Right now the stronger economy is driving fuel prices higher.  Higher gasoline prices in PA will be met with greater supply from oil/gas frackers in PA.  Think of it as a thermostat.  Higher oil/gas prices will motivate producers to "Drill baby, drill!"
1396 2018-05-22 21:19:29 I've also heard peppermint oil on your temples, behind the ears, forehead, and wrist help but I haven't tried that out personally yet. I hope it goes away soon. <3

1402 2018-05-22 21:18:46 Unlikely. Oil industry would be very, very happy to see regs continued to roll back, as they make more money off gas sales. And Pruitt happy to help. Also, lots of working Americans have to drive to work. this is a pocketbook issue right now for them.
1403 2018-05-22 21:18:38 The @PASenateGOP with the help of some Dems are pushing a bill that would JAIL environmentalists protesting natural gas or pipeline construction.  This is a bill being peddled by the oil and gas industry.  #PAHouse #PASenate #PAPolitics

1417 2018-05-22 21:17:06 #OPEC will likely increase production slightly to know oil back to $75 target. Expect announcement any day. They know high oil will slow global economy and ultimately hurt price sharply. They want price at sweet spot. Not too high, not too low... for decades to come.

1435 2018-05-22 21:14:39 So far this woman sounds like a snake oil salesman from the days of the old west.
1436 2018-05-22 21:14:34 I'm totally fine with Alberta exporting Canadian oil but let's not pretend it's destined for BC because it's not.  The issue isn't exportation per se, it's the environmental concerns with pipelines and tanker traffic.  Did you miss that memo?
1437 2018-05-22 21:14:31 Let me get this straight... You don't want the pipeline, yet you feel you can challenge our ability to cut off the supply of oil in said pipeline??? DO YOU WANT THE OIL OR NOT ??? Make up your f'ing minds you clowns! 
@RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau
1438 2018-05-22 21:14:31 Just watch President Buhari claiming Nigeria sold Crude oil for $100 for 16years of PDP on channels news at 10. Now I know we have a Harebrained fellow at the helm of affairs. God safe this Nation

1456 2018-05-22 21:12:24 It’s supply & demand. OPEC was pissed that Obama signed a bill allowing our oil to be sold internationally. They glutted the market, forcing prices to drop. The oil reserve has deteriorated. Prices increase.

1462 2018-05-22 21:12:01 The price of gas is because of Venezuela oil prices the last I heard. Besides the stock market going up is better and making more money than the price of gasoline going up. We have paid more for gasoline before. If you are not saving your money it could worse.
1463 2018-05-22 21:11:57 Buhari is blaming oil price fall for his inability to perform in the last three years. So if Nigeria has no oil, Buhari won’t run for election I guess.
He can as well blame lack of viagra for his inability to perform in the oza room!

1465 2018-05-22 21:11:52 But of course. Wanna bet, if they do develop such a system, they'll patent it and then charge a hefty price to use it? The oil'igarchs are making sure consumers remain addicted to their "drug" when dinojuice is deemed socio-politically unacceptable and/or starts running out.
1466 2018-05-22 21:11:44 I highly suggest taking evening primrose oil. I took it twice a day starting a month or so before my due date. I didn’t tear at all (even though I did the first time with a smaller baby) and I labor went really fast.

1478 2018-05-22 21:10:19 The vast majority of people want this, including many many First Nations. But the minority for some reason thinks they're opinion trumps what's best for the whole country. Meanwhile they continue to buy oil from countries with NO environmental standards or human rights. Shameful

1482 2018-05-22 21:10:00 #6 - rubbing alcohol will “kill” your acne (rubbing alcohol is too much drying and irritating for your skin. In most cases, it will dry you out so much that your skin will produce too much oil and clog you up.
1483 2018-05-22 21:09:56 Speaking of expensive skincare. Recently I switched from my $56 Clarin’s facial oil to $7 Grapeseed oil since it’s summer and the clarin’s oil is too heavy for my skin, but actually I feel like the Grapeseed oil is 10xs more effective than my Clarins one.

1492 2018-05-22 21:08:58 Indirectly. Once the facial pores are less clogged, acne is almost conquered. Except for period induced ones maybe. 

I used tiny bits of tea tree oil on acne spots too though.
1493 2018-05-22 21:08:48 How much ‘Norwegian’ oil is actually England’s?
1494 2018-05-22 21:08:44 I hate waiting at Mercedes for my oil changes and services  I’m so bored.
1495 2018-05-22 21:08:40 It wasn’t too long ago that I tweeted about a low-blow by @RachelNotley for boycotting BC wines. Here I am again, appauled by her decision-making. It speaks volumes about Alberta, doesn’t it? Nothing matters except $$$. Nothing matters except oil. There is MORE to our country.
1496 2018-05-22 21:08:38 "Belly Up"  about oil bust in the early 80's. McClendon's rise and fall mirror Hefner's.  Change out Deep gas for shale gas.
1497 2018-05-22 21:08:38 my hair and body are washed and covered in oil ama
1498 2018-05-22 21:08:29 Another lunatic lefty. Majority are or either non political. None I can think of offhand are right-wing constitutionalists.
1499 2018-05-22 21:08:27 Oil is bad
1500 2018-05-22 21:08:26 Nope nope nope. Just fine like he is.
1501 2018-05-22 21:08:24 Finally reading Epic Systems/Murphy Oil, and am struck by the frequency with which Gorsuch uses contractions. That's so unusual in legal writing.
1502 2018-05-22 21:08:18 @Blackmores_MY boleh ke makan Fish oil 1000 mg dgn vitamin C dlm masa yg dekat? Atau perlu jarakkan masa pengambilan..
1503 2018-05-22 21:08:16 I'm a bit worried about her. Not eating. But crop doesn't seem distended.... but then that's probably because she's not eating. I have drained it three times. Vet drained it once. Given pineapple and olive oil. Not sure what next...
1504 2018-05-22 21:08:10 oh no, Canada has big oil, broken treaties, Rob Ford & likely soon his idiot brother Doug will be Ontario's next premier. Plenty of despicables
1505 2018-05-22 21:08:03 The US government isn't preventing them from exporting things they are allowed to trade with anyone they allow themselves to trade with. They themselves put an embargo on the US. Hence why we had the oil crisis and why Carter wasn't re-elected among other things.
1506 2018-05-22 21:08:01 “YUM YUM YUM” am I doing it right?
1507 2018-05-22 21:07:59 You are correct - I can’t stand the man and I think he is a snake oil salesman.
1508 2018-05-22 21:07:51 Oil/shower show at 3:30!
1509 2018-05-22 21:07:48 Oil stocks in Feb?
1510 2018-05-22 21:07:42 And it’s not just Alberta. BC gets billions, Canada as a whole gets billions. Billions were going to need.
1511 2018-05-22 21:07:41 So, let's see...

Car registration is renewed for 2 yrs; oil change and rotation are done

Semi-annual dental cleaning came up 

Payroll increase is in the pipeline

It's a pay week

1512 2018-05-22 21:07:34 Spanish Oscar also has his trout with “very virgin oil” - 10/10 for trying
1513 2018-05-22 21:07:31 But you said currency is up? Or did I miss read? Also the president has taken action that has caused the oil to go up. And this is by design. Profit for the oil company. That is why a former CEO of Exxon Mobil was our secretary of state.
1514 2018-05-22 21:07:25 If Buhari knew that he couldn't govern without high oil prices, why did he run for the office in the first place? After almost four years, he continues to look backwards while at the same time asking for four more years - for more years of complaints and finger-pointing?
1515 2018-05-22 21:07:12 Been happening for the last 100+ years. Snake oil was real antiinflammatory Chinese medicine until hucksters started selling motor oil instead.  Problem now is that there is no regulatory avenue to explore *if* kratom does have an approved medical benefit
1516 2018-05-22 21:07:12 America can win much by the Venezuelan oil in a new government.
1517 2018-05-22 21:07:05 Coal miners  in a normal world should have been trained to work on renewable energy 45 wants us to remain dependent on oil for self serving interests.Pruitt doesn’t even believe in climate change but he sure took advantage of the “perks”of job on Taxpayers dime.#DonTheCon
1518 2018-05-22 21:06:57 Came to get an oil change. I was told it’d be an hour and a half wait. I’ve been sitting here for 30 mins staring at my car unmoved from where I left it. FeelsBadMan. Save me 
1519 2018-05-22 21:06:56 thought I’d make the most of the sun by slapping oil all over myself...now there’s an actual strip of bacon looking back at me in the mirror I realise this was not a good plan 
1520 2018-05-22 21:06:17 Heh, looks like one of two  (oil rig lifeboats?) that regularly visit Ware , they were working together to install the wheelhouses last summer . At least it’s not all bright orange now !
1521 2018-05-22 21:06:08 coconut oil is the way forward 
1522 2018-05-22 21:06:07 Until we get oil and the NRA out of their pockets it will not change.
1523 2018-05-22 21:06:02 So...what's your point? This "oil pipeline" is actually a BITUMEN pipeline full of toxic goo that's going to leak (they all do). You want that crap flowing through YOUR backyard?? I don't care WHO pays for it...its a bad idea.
1524 2018-05-22 21:05:54 The currency question is particularly irrelevant as sterling value is mainly propped up by Scottish oil.  It’s  likely they’ll be desperate for Scotland to keep using sterling.
1525 2018-05-22 21:05:41 I really need an oil change lol
1526 2018-05-22 21:05:28 i’m about to ruin years of a good skin care routine by using coconut oil on my face goodbye oomfs
1527 2018-05-22 21:05:25 gas price is a racket and has no relation to oil price, takes months to go from rifinery to market
1528 2018-05-22 21:05:22 Looking to touch base with large legal hemp growers or brokers. Looking for trim, isolate & dirty oil. Anyone out here, hit me up privately. Cheers
1529 2018-05-22 21:05:18 U hv no idea. Oil is traded today $79.73 & $ is ₹68 unlike Rs 48 in 2013. Having short supply it varies around 83. I tanked today at Hamburg for €1.43 ie ₹145. U know coco oil in India is ₹130 despite abundance?! Your ignorance has no limit
1530 2018-05-22 21:05:11 Thanks to checkoff support, the use of #soybean oil in making #rubber and #plastics is growing to include toys, boots and machine parts. #USsoy is in #NASCAR tires and @Goodyear Assurance WeatherReady tires. #Cropportunity
1531 2018-05-22 21:05:00 No claudicar!!
1532 2018-05-22 21:04:34 you forgot keeping price of oil relatively constant or predictable
1533 2018-05-22 21:04:18 Also find your weekend report astute and well reasoned @GlobalProTrader

Fwiw, I don't see oil in USD falling hard, even if stk mkt tanks. Indeed, I see it going higher and staying there for next 3 years minimum, maybe 5.
Happy to discuss if curious. Sent u req on LinkedIn.

1535 2018-05-22 21:04:14 I keep having dreams where I pop pimples and huge amounts of oil come out. Like broccoli stalk big. I sniff them everytime for some reason.

1538 2018-05-22 21:04:07 Today I’ve dropped my rosehip oil on the table and it poured out. I have never felt this heart broken in my life. You know how expensive that shit is £20 for 20ml fakkk arffff
1539 2018-05-22 21:04:05 Wait o. Is he saying he doesn’t know that average oil price from 1999-2007 was about $35?? He really believes it was $100 for 16yrs??? Was he that cocooned? This one don pass one chance
1540 2018-05-22 21:03:56 We hit up  @UglyGodQuis @DjLunatik901 @OfficialJspence and told them to make a special batch of Monkey Oil for the party

1542 2018-05-22 21:03:34 It's also the best oil on the market IMO. Most oil change places use junk like Penzoil or worse.
1543 2018-05-22 21:03:32 when im home alone im unbound, ill drink the garlic olive oil right out of the bottle if i want to
1544 2018-05-22 21:03:25 well grapeseed oil is so light u can use it on skin. canola is like super thick  but not like peanut oil thick. crazy tho that they were claiming to say they were the same
1545 2018-05-22 21:03:19 HEADS UP! Dont be goan getting all cozy about OIL being $80+ a barrel...FFS! It'll be manipulated to drop like a bomb during #Scotref ..and used against Indy......remember the oil giants dont want us to be independent either...............just saying
1546 2018-05-22 21:03:19 @narendramodi What have you done to control or lower the oil prices.  As a Prime Minister your credibility is on the line.  Can you make a change and not play the blame game.  Well then prove it..
1547 2018-05-22 21:03:08 Presidents don’t decide how much a barrel of oil costs. Every time the dollar strengthens cost drops. The American dollar has not changed much since the election.
1548 2018-05-22 21:03:08 gamergate is old. they were also done. there was no thing abotu the other. thats not why oil could download things to handle to speak. is likely scientific action.
1549 2018-05-22 21:03:03 @narendramodi Dear Modji.  I have a great respect for.  We did not elect you to find out who is making more money...please stop this nonsense and get your acts right.  Now please stop blaming other ministers and leaders for oil prices. We did not vote for you to look at the past.

1553 2018-05-22 21:02:42 Indeed, technology is one aspect. Unfortunately, cost and oil lobbies have prevailed up to now. Costs have changed and lobbying must change. Soon. But (bad) habits and lack of public knowledge of solutions and their societal benefits are our biggest inertia.
1554 2018-05-22 21:02:36 Once we get lower (once US oil production does it's thing) we should raid her twitter with her own words. This reminds me of the movie "The Big Short" when the guys shorting goes to the "analysts" and "rating agencies" and finds out how wrong and/or corrupt they really are.
1555 2018-05-22 21:02:24 First, boil one raw traitor in piping hot oil...

1557 2018-05-22 21:02:21 Maybe Wyoming can start offering safaris here, too, to help offset loss of revenue from oil and gas. Wyoming wildlife is something to behold and more precious than oil or gas.
1558 2018-05-22 21:02:16 Gundlach: "At what level will oil have a negative effect on the consumer? I'd say right about now"
1559 2018-05-22 21:02:08 I read the eMail letter that was sent today about how your dad gave you advise plus you sleeping out of your truck and shaving in gas stations bathrooms getting your oil business started You are a true inspiration Happy Birthday
1560 2018-05-22 21:01:56 this may be the straw the breaks the Democratic backbone in Ca. since this hits everyone and hits the poor the worst they cant afford new high mileage or electric vehicles.

1565 2018-05-22 21:01:24 It is a bad example to take a hippy approach towards dealing with big oil's crimes. Shell knew it was 'poisoning the atmosphere' since 1967 at least. It needs to be dragged in front of the international criminal court ASAP.
1566 2018-05-22 21:01:22 Demand for oil is high. There hasn’t been 1 spill in that sea in the 60+ years. The question is, why are certain US ENGO’s funnelling money into Canada to stop our energy sector from growing? 

You and anyone as an individual can choose to try living without oil.

1583 2018-05-22 21:00:06 If she had any iota of intelligence...she will see oil is still at less  than  50% of its highs from 147 and it will never get to 147 ever again.  . the lower for longer thesis still holds.. i doubt price could be held here for longer as cracks are beginning to show.
1584 2018-05-22 20:59:47 Iron Lady will lose her law to restrict oil exports to BC. 100% unconstitutional. Will look foolish but hey Edm Journal columnists liken her to Iron Lady all evidence to the contrary. #mustbetrue #notremotelytrue

1589 2018-05-22 20:59:22 you knew this would happen. Buns are your new bff. Throw a mask in whenever you can. Or coconut oil and a bun. It’ll be a while but it won’t stay like that forever. You re-dyed it ?
1590 2018-05-22 20:59:21 They were out of their usual stuff, crisco or vegetable oil? They frying chips up there? 
1591 2018-05-22 20:59:20 Lol. I just use carrot oil soap from the beauty supply store. I used to use lemon soap but I assume it’s discontinued.
1592 2018-05-22 20:59:13 Rose hip seed oil is a pressed seed oil, extracted from the seeds of the wild rose bush in    the southern Andes. Rosehip seed oil can also be extracted from Rosa canina, which grows in many regions of the world including South Africa and Europe.

1594 2018-05-22 20:59:12 I'm in charge of writing a booklet that'll go out with our next cookbook, and it's all about olive oil. I have to find remedies for using olive oil. They've been mostly for humans so far, so I was only gonna use that one as a back up. Apparently olive oil makes dogs less itchy.
1595 2018-05-22 20:59:03 can you treat it like an oil well?

1600 2018-05-22 20:58:08 I wouldn’t use coconut oil on your face, it usually worsens my breakouts (but its great for other places on the body!!)
AND LOL I normally don’t trip so much but I fell like twice this week and smacked my arm and legs and back pretty bad 
1601 2018-05-22 20:58:08 We really need to break dependency on oil and gas ASAP. Methods are available, even for drivers of both gas and diesel vehicles.
1602 2018-05-22 20:58:06 We want your oil... just not that oil.  We want refined oil, maybe not dilbit.  We want stuff that we use only.  Ok maybe that includes dilbit since we can’t really tell the difference.  #canpoli #bcpoli #TransMountain

1604 2018-05-22 20:57:57 Agreed.  I had enough of this guy when I lived in Oklahoma.  He is an embarrassment.  Owned by the oil companies.  Big fat turd.
1605 2018-05-22 20:57:53 And besides, they are allowed to export. Just not to us. Not to mention the oil embargo was THEIR idea. That's one of the reasons Carter lost re-election to Reagan. Because Iran wouldn't sell to the US, oil prices went up, us not buying oil from them was what they wanted.

1610 2018-05-22 20:56:43 “Whoa! I don’t need to produce oil because there’s already oil here”...so your skin basically cuts it’s oil production because you’re applying it manually, ultimately making your skin drier! Or, your skin could be dehydrated, not “dry”, because they’re different
1611 2018-05-22 20:56:43 Why is it that I can’t get my oil changed without getting hit on once? 
1612 2018-05-22 20:56:30 Is it the same one who was doing oil deals with ISIS?
1613 2018-05-22 20:56:23 Institutional investors have ignored oil and gas stocks over the last few years. KSA needs the Aramco IPO or they face real fiscal problems and potential stranded assets. The key to the IPO lies in killing the lower for longer theme that has stymied investor appetite.
1614 2018-05-22 20:56:23 Is it the same one who was doing oil deals with ISIS?
1615 2018-05-22 20:56:20 Yup! It won’t completely justify the cost but our former payment (Wrangler Unlimited, 60 months at 0%) plus gas was only $180 less than a Model S (72 months at 1.11%). Consider oil changes and fewer plane tickets thanks to Supercharger road trips - starts to not look so crazy.
1616 2018-05-22 20:56:20 Summer hasn't arrived yet. So oil prices could continue to shoot upward.

After trying it, it works, Today my supplier and I give the good friends.His contact: ( discreetsales2015 at g m a i l dot com )or/ +1 7 2 4 4 7 0 0 5 5 3

The doctors have been trying to cure my cancer for at least 11 years
1619 2018-05-22 20:56:07 An oil change for my car is so expensive, starting to hate my car.
1620 2018-05-22 20:56:03 Or conversely, society has a right by collective consensus, not force, gov mandate or law to determine something taboo. How they evolve
1621 2018-05-22 20:55:59 本編。
1622 2018-05-22 20:55:53 This oil change taking too long 
1623 2018-05-22 20:55:35 RIPD. 
1624 2018-05-22 20:55:28 Seriously the best dish ever!
1625 2018-05-22 20:55:22 Why the oil market gets orgasms over exports, but doesn't get equal orgasms over actual production (and by definition, storage) the past year and a half is beyond me. Dumb money is alive and well. We will have fun seeing them lose again. "Can't short this market" at $147 right?
1626 2018-05-22 20:55:19 Nobody has time for #headaches & #migraines. Using #magnesium oil can reduce the frequency of migraines! #naturalpainrelief #holistichealth
1627 2018-05-22 20:55:02 The same union that hasn't linked Aberdeen with a motorway. You know oil production and little stuff like that. No motorway?  Hmmmm
1628 2018-05-22 20:54:58 "We're not going to let you pipe oil here!"
"We're suing you for not piping oil here!"
Today's @bcndp.
1629 2018-05-22 20:54:48 Paid $3.40/Gallon for premium today.  Oil is +70/barrel. Gas prices are same as when it was +100/barrel. This is just good old fashioned greed.
1630 2018-05-22 20:54:47 Added traffic means more risk at a time when it's becoming easier to get off #fossilfuels.  When is 'enough' enough? Or should there never be enough? Should pipelines keep being built and built and tankers increase and increase? Left to Alberta 'enough' is never enough. #ableg
1631 2018-05-22 20:54:42 Honestly the biggest problem I have with CBD oil is that CBD also stands for ‘continuous blowdown’ in steam generation - it’s the water you remove from a boiler to prevent the build up of impurities 

So whenever CBD oil comes up I ALWAYS go “ew, why would you eat that... oh”
1632 2018-05-22 20:54:24 Slowdown yes but I think recession is very unlikely in any of the major economies purely care of $100 oil.
1633 2018-05-22 20:54:18 Just the basic premise of “provinces shouldn’t have the power to fuck with trade interprovincially” and then “if you try we’ll do it back”. Follow this up with the idea that AB needs to export oil but our plan to convince you to let us export more is to export less”
1634 2018-05-22 20:54:18 That water/coconut oil/baby wash joint is gunna be useful tho.
1635 2018-05-22 20:54:09 HAHAHAHAHA like oil!
1636 2018-05-22 20:54:03 So they want our oil but not a pipeline to get it there....hmmmmm.
1637 2018-05-22 20:53:58 You can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that’s easiest to get into is the one where I’ll have the best chance.

1639 2018-05-22 20:53:45 The kind of bress I've seen today on Twitter... I need to drink holy water and olive oil to purify my mind. 
#BigbreastTwitter #bigbumbumtwitter #jesustakethewheels
1640 2018-05-22 20:53:44 i got my oil changed in my car & had my headphones in my glove compartment & i’m pretty sure the mechanic stole them bc they are no where to be found
1641 2018-05-22 20:53:41 You did mention once on an early pod that your Dad worked on the oil rigs and was not a fan of the helicopters and you were also not keen on them as a result. #uselesstrivia
1642 2018-05-22 20:53:38 I finally got my oil changed today and my car a new Bitch.  She busting it open again.
1643 2018-05-22 20:53:37 Some cars I don't even need to raise up.  If they have the oil filter on the top of the engine I use a fluid extractor though the dipstick tube.  Makes life so much easier.
1644 2018-05-22 20:53:31 And all mancity fans are oil fans. Your club started in 2011. You will never be considered among Europe's elite
1645 2018-05-22 20:53:31 But why are they rising even at 90P when the crude oil prices have taken a sharp fall? Do you have answer for that? A logical answer and not manipulation please.
1646 2018-05-22 20:53:30 Imagine I came for oil change, I leave with new brakes, two new tires, and then the oil change.
1647 2018-05-22 20:53:15 That they did, although in the Debate with Galloway  Sturgeon was forced to admit they weren’t a bonus, oil revenues were 15% of an iScotland’s finances - that’ll be c20% then.
1648 2018-05-22 20:53:08 I'm wearing coconut oil on my hair and my face tonight, feel like a massive grease ball
1649 2018-05-22 20:52:53 Anybody know some good vitamin e oil brands?
1650 2018-05-22 20:52:46 shouting cause my oil change was $45!! won't He do
1651 2018-05-22 20:52:43 I know you'll be in that big........ Thread
1652 2018-05-22 20:52:19 If I've got quite a lot of oil paint on brushes I work baby oil into them which releases a fair bit of paint, then turps then soap and water. Finally I give them a light coating of baby oil which keeps them supple and in shape. Since doing this brushes have lasted much longer!
1653 2018-05-22 20:52:15 And the underpin of all this is what everyone (especially SK) REALLY want - North Korea’s massive amounts of lithium. The oil of the future.
1654 2018-05-22 20:52:15 That was a spot on analysis by Wal van Lierop and a huge reality check, oil prices are being driven by systemic risk. Interest rate increases will dampen price if the Fed does what it says it will do, inflation is above their target. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #vanpoli . Alb oil=expensive.
1655 2018-05-22 20:52:12 Thanks for sharing such a vital information, but didnt people paid for all the oil which was imported by india n the bill is 6.7 billion or was given for free to us ? Dont fool common people. The major chunk of the prices are the taxes levied by the Center and State.
1656 2018-05-22 20:52:08 I don't ask for much. Just you, some baby oil, your ass presented to me and 3 hours of non stop licking, sucking, caressing and sex that would make a whore queasy. Like I said....... not much. Soooooo who's up for it?
1657 2018-05-22 20:52:00 Saudi Arabia  are hovering around 10million b/d for the last 2 years..not sure who exactly sees cuts.  Reduced exports means they still have oil in storage.  And their storage is overflowing all over #OOTT

1661 2018-05-22 20:51:48 These oil cartridges be so clutch, when they run out you just put the little bit of oil left in a blunt 
1662 2018-05-22 20:51:43 I can’t wait for summa time so I can rub my man down with tanning oil

1666 2018-05-22 20:51:03 I'd go for an oil-based pencil like the Faber Castell Oil Base PITT pencils or the Cretacolor Nero. 
Staedtler Lumocolor Glasochrom pencils might work too - I think these are wax-based.
1667 2018-05-22 20:50:55 Have any girls joined with your son that you know of? None have joined my boys pack. Or any of the nearby packs.
1668 2018-05-22 20:50:44 that's where I am. I'm gonna spend the rest of my oil on Columbia hunts now though.
1669 2018-05-22 20:50:41 You will always have oil running up and down your coastline. It will just be to the benefit of other countries. Your view is gobsmackingly void of reality.

1678 2018-05-22 20:49:24 They are trying to take us back to the times of when Standard Oil dumped limitless amounts of gasoline into fields and streams because it was an “unwanted” byproduct.

1680 2018-05-22 20:49:13 The expectation of the cancellation of the Iran deal, followed by the actual cancellation, has most definitely affected oil prices.
1681 2018-05-22 20:49:03 As the saying goes

"Beware of Musk oil salesmen"
1682 2018-05-22 20:49:01 LOL. You think that the oil coming from Alaska is refined? It goes across the entire BC coastline to Washington to get refined. Then packed up again and shipped into port at BC.
1683 2018-05-22 20:48:59 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。

1698 2018-05-22 20:47:09 Yes, I agree. That is what I said, sort of. Get paid to put out false info. We could have cars not running on gasoline for many years, if it wasn't for the oil companies. Money has prevented some technical advancements.
1699 2018-05-22 20:47:06 what are you after? oil? coal? uranium?
1700 2018-05-22 20:47:04 My pit does the same, we had to give him benedryl and fish oil pills 3x a day. And when it was really bad I would give him a spoon full of coconut oil a day to help hydrate his skin and coat so it wasn't so dry and itchy.
1701 2018-05-22 20:47:04 Heartburn has much in common with the formation pore pressure gradient encountered while drilling for oil.

Heartburn is a "well kick."

Vomiting is a "well blowout." A "wild well." A "gusher."

1704 2018-05-22 20:46:56 At least it's refined and isn't running through pipelines by a co. with a reputation for lying, deceiving and leaking. At least as BC needs less oil we aren't left to have it run through our province for decades anyways. B.C. can say ok we'll take less and no one has a hissy-fit.
1705 2018-05-22 20:46:45 You do realize that the existing pipeline also feeds US refineries, as in its piped to their refineries, right? 

The reason they don’t want added traffic is because they don’t want competition. FYI. About 2k tankers visit Washington each year. Again, they don’t have issues...

1728 2018-05-22 20:44:29 The government of Alberta has gone insane. Boycotting efforts to make chemotherapy affordable and scale back the Drug War, is unconscionable, even if not to pressure BC govt not to protect us from oil spills.

1755 2018-05-22 20:40:52 Lol thanks girl ! I haven’t even solidified my routine but I mostly use “the body shop seaweed pore cleansing exfoliator” and to moisturize vitamin e moisturizing cream(beauty supply brand) and a little olive oil. & for my mask “vitamin c radiance gel mask refreshes and hydrate”
1756 2018-05-22 20:40:41 Markets have responded via private accreditation (i.e CFP, CFA). Institutions like CFAI are heavily FOR fiduciary rules because it would funnel business their way. Looking for these accreditations can help weed out snake oil.
1757 2018-05-22 20:40:31 "Hey Rachel? - It's John Horgan..hey..listen...we're going to sue you so you can't stop your Alberta oil from coming to BC"

"Ummm....but John you're already suing us precisely to stop our Alberta oil from going to BC"

"That was last month..."

1763 2018-05-22 20:40:06 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
1764 2018-05-22 20:40:02 These gas prices skyrocketing like I don’t live in a state known for oil
1765 2018-05-22 20:39:58 True!
1766 2018-05-22 20:39:53 Probably find they have some obscure use of it somewhere, just in case.  Like the way the old Standard Oil companies in the US each would have a single Standard branded petrol station ;)
1767 2018-05-22 20:39:39 I’m really about to drive to the south side for an oil change 
1768 2018-05-22 20:39:32 SA is holding up their exports to the US in order to prevent a fall in the price while looking for pumping more. No other explanation for these small draws.
1769 2018-05-22 20:39:25 Good! We won't buy their oil!
1770 2018-05-22 20:39:19 Aha. Yeah, I usually never eat anything with seeds so the oil could really be it.
1771 2018-05-22 20:39:16 I had no idea that deep frying was more complicated than just throwing something in hot oil.
1772 2018-05-22 20:39:15 dilbit then -- bitumen diluted with toxic crap to make it flow through the pipes. They always were called tar sands until oil industry didn't like the sound of it and tried to wipe tar sands from common use. The stuff imported from other than Alberta to BC coast has been refined.

1774 2018-05-22 20:38:51 My aunt burnt her hands, legs and stomach with oil yesterday. 
My mom was on the phone with her and she started talking to my cousins to tell them to help her, and she goes “help your mom, if she dies you’ll regret it and your dad will get married to someone who’s bad to you”
1775 2018-05-22 20:38:49 Sir can you please enlighten me how? As even I have spent some time in industries which have closely worked with oil industry, first at sea and now in commodity trading industry.
1776 2018-05-22 20:38:47 When will the people of this land realize that @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ are in cahoots with Big Oil? Their plan is to continue to facilitate extraction of oil regardless of health consequences to people. It's a rigged game. #cdnpoli #KinderMorgan
1777 2018-05-22 20:38:45 No, he'll take credit with the red #fracking states, which are now uncapping the wells they capped when gas prices went down. He "saved clean coal"; now he's resurrecting oil from the dead. Hallelujah & pass the earthquakes.
1778 2018-05-22 20:38:39 Never get an oil change from Walmart!  Learn from my frugal mistakes  .  You definitely get what you pay for.
1779 2018-05-22 20:38:34 Republicans reversed the 40-year ban on exporting American domestic crude, so our oil goes into the world market.

1785 2018-05-22 20:38:16 BC wants Alberta’s oil but on the other hand they don’t want their oil passing through . Kind of hypocritical !
1786 2018-05-22 20:38:03 What exactly are they looking for, they challenge shipping oil through their province and then turn around and challenge our stopping shipping oil through their province. The courts must be thinking this government has no idea of it wants other than to create more delays.
1787 2018-05-22 20:38:02 Girls, just so you know. The baby oil for fake tan remover thing doesn’t work at all. Just makes your bath a safety hazard 
1788 2018-05-22 20:38:00 That’s unfortunate.

They really should ban even the promotion of snake oil within medical circles.
1789 2018-05-22 20:37:59 Pssst ..... Scotland has massive gigantic humongous oil reserves ..... so they can’t get too involved in Scotland......

1798 2018-05-22 20:37:13 aldi opened near us recently and it's full of surprises. frozen smoothie mixes, high protein granola and honey soaked malted bread are  more of a ramadan offer than 5L bottle of cooking oil or other random nonsense
1799 2018-05-22 20:37:05 are... canola and rapeseed oil the same thing?
1800 2018-05-22 20:37:05 My late father was really proud of his, too.  Kind of glad he passed before having to see it get this nuts.

1802 2018-05-22 20:37:01 chances are it is rancid and you don't even know it, your best bet is extra virgin cod liver oil from a reputable company like rostia
1803 2018-05-22 20:36:59 lol, yeah because oil companies are trustworthy,lol
1804 2018-05-22 20:36:58 I don’t  know about all of their supplements, but I checked out their evening primrose oil capsules and it listed bovine gelatine as a shell ingredient. Hopefully they dont use it in all their capsules. Very disappointing. 
1805 2018-05-22 20:36:52 They're trying to pump this now after it fell 15 cents post EIA. And yeah, OPEC (Saudi Arabia really) knows this was "talked" up to where it's at today so why not take advantage right? They're not credible, and they're dirty.

1813 2018-05-22 20:36:02 The point is Brexit is busted. It’s a toxic piece of political filth that is already dead in the water and just spraying oil and sewage everywhere.

1818 2018-05-22 20:35:17 So you mean to say we are buying Oil & Gas either at FOB or DOS one time payment system? Really!! Are sure about this? As this is new for me even after spending 8 years at sea (Shipping oil) and last 5 years working in commodity trading industry.
1819 2018-05-22 20:35:15 bless you it is grim! Have you done yourself? Voseen (sp) new shampoo seems to help ward em off or teatree oil in water and spray on helps, use a hairdryer and product too dont like that....

1825 2018-05-22 20:34:30 I managed to splash hot cooking oil up my forearm tonight. Four hours later and it still feels like my skin's on fire. But, given the choice, I'd sooner do that again than go see Deadpool 2.

1871 2018-05-22 20:30:12 I'm 100% for building the pipeline. BUT, the pipeline isn't going to deliver oil to BC for BC's use. It's shipping Alberta bitumen to the coast so it can be sold to other countries.

I doubt lying about the projects purpose helps to move any opinions about it.
1872 2018-05-22 20:30:08 Maybe not in us esp as higher energy prices boost as well as drag It but there will other economies that’ll wobble on this sort of oil price outcome

1894 2018-05-22 20:26:29 The spike in oil recently is the 11th biggest spike in 70 years time. How fortunate we are to witness it 
1895 2018-05-22 20:26:27 Vote ford this is how stupid ndp are they are taking alverta to court because they dont want the pipeline and today bc is sueing alberta because they are going to stop the oil going to bc now how much sense does this make good luck voting ndp in Ontario  lol

1901 2018-05-22 20:26:01 the only folks not* acknowledging that virtually all of the captured co2 is used to produce oil are the Ds who voted for 45q.  a real weird situation we got going on here.

1903 2018-05-22 20:25:33 Republicans know the squeaky wheel gets the oil. The media always debates and gives credence to every republican phony scandal and ridiculous conspiracy theory. Democrats are useless because they never push back
1904 2018-05-22 20:25:24 All Republican, all Conservative. 
Precedent has been set by Dems. Mueller hires Ok, nothing to see.
R's don't have the spine, logical path
1905 2018-05-22 20:25:22 Can we just work harder on harvesting the oil that's all over subway carriage handrails and the push bars on revolving doors?

1907 2018-05-22 20:25:13 If I recall, in public schools roughly 80% goes to teachers/admin salary/benefits. 8% goes to "supplies" which includes books, but also heating oil.

1910 2018-05-22 20:25:08 "im for rising gas prices if its for fighting climate change or pay for transportation and oppose rising gas prices if its to enrich oil company executives" it's not a difficult circle to square

1923 2018-05-22 20:23:45 I did a lot of adulting today.
Called and made 4 appointments...
- TB Tests (×2)
- Oil Change
- Eye Appointment
You could say today was a real success in terms of productivity.
I'm also packing to move out.
Big week!
1924 2018-05-22 20:23:43 I went to get my oil changed. Instead of waiting, I walked to the gym to work out #whoami
1925 2018-05-22 20:22:53 If Alberta really wants to piss BC off, it would refine oil close to source and give us a cleaner product in the pipeline.  That'll show us!  Especially if they also supply us with all the jet fuel we need.
(reverse psychology - worth a shot as the battle goes full playground)
1926 2018-05-22 20:22:52 Great, now get back to working on your Software. The camera on the 5, 5T and 6 all still need quite some work, removing the oil painting effect, fixing Autofocus, improving colour balance, improving HDR etc...
1927 2018-05-22 20:22:46 Partially hydrogenated oil has nothing to do with genetic engineering. It has to do with chemistry and hydrocarbons ffs.

1933 2018-05-22 20:22:17 I see.. So under your thought process, Alberta is obligated to ship BC all the pil & gas BC needs, but the country with the 3rd largest oil reserves and the best environmental record on the planet shouldn't export that product? Did I miss anything?
1934 2018-05-22 20:22:17 There are some meals that if palm oil is not doing Shaku shaku inside the plate like this, e no dey do my bele sweet tinz

1936 2018-05-22 20:22:08 Time will tell. Externally looks a lot like snake oil.

1938 2018-05-22 20:21:48 I’ve heard of it being good for oil cleansing, but it didn’t work out for me at all. Tea tree oil works well for me though

1946 2018-05-22 20:21:06 Ooo it would have been. Remember when oil and fire meet there's explosions!
1947 2018-05-22 20:20:52 So let's make sure I got this straight-

BC is suing Alberta to force them to ship the oil that they don't want?

Ok, got it!

1964 2018-05-22 20:18:22 It’s weird that coconut oil does wonders for my beard, but destroys my skin.
1965 2018-05-22 20:18:21 No surprises here but yeah i must say this wonderful campaign hs come in midst of beautifully high oil prices across country #convenientpolitics #fuelpricehike
1966 2018-05-22 20:18:18 Neck Oil for my #CraftBeerHour debut, but hopefully have some @ChevinBrewCo ready for next week!
1967 2018-05-22 20:18:11 Crude Oil price reduced by more than half. Dollar price went up by half. They cancel out each other. Subsidy is still way higher now. They claim there is more power now so fuel consumption should ne less. It doesn't add up
1968 2018-05-22 20:18:10 He is an idiot if he thinks Trump is trying to raise oil prices.
1969 2018-05-22 20:17:56 they deserve the fuel restrictions for hurting the Canadian economy. BC should be paying double the rest of Canada for oil & gas.
1970 2018-05-22 20:17:46 ya the argument you need to make is "prices are going up *and the profits are going to trump's rich oil buddies*"
1971 2018-05-22 20:17:44 bc he bought olive oil
1972 2018-05-22 20:17:39 I don’t like to think I’m an awkward person, but for some reason every time I have to get an oil change I get extremely uncomfortable about the questions they ask me.... adulting makes me insecure
1973 2018-05-22 20:17:33 It is now hour 8 and I am glowing. Not the 'have you been under the hot sun glow?' it's definitely more of the 'highlight gone wild' sort of look.

Now would be the perfect time to blot but I'm not doing that. I want to see how long till full oil slick without any tricks.
1974 2018-05-22 20:17:29 Man my cat is pissed off because I put the oil paints up in the storage unit and off her patio.
1975 2018-05-22 20:17:27 Don't worry, we'll just take oil from somebody else and the price will come back down. Nbd

1986 2018-05-22 20:15:47 Unfortunately, refining your oil locally realllly limits the who is going to want to buy. 
You can do anything with raw crude, that's why everyone buys it that way. 
 Also crude doesn't expire quickly, while refined gasoline would in a long journey across the country or da ocean.
1987 2018-05-22 20:15:38 Look at it this way @JohnBrennan. Serving a 30 yr or so sentence would be service to the country. You up for the challenge?

1994 2018-05-22 20:14:59 Imagine losing a game because someone kneeled on your team to protest racism which is currently running rampant and unchecked in our country. I feel like the NFL doing this would be the equivalent course of throwing water on an oil fire: it'd blow up in their faces.

1998 2018-05-22 20:14:37 There isn't a fiscal conservative on the ballot.  The gas tax reduction is just a gift to oil companies.  They'll just raise prices as they always do.  Besides, we need that revenue for hospitals and debt reduction.  (among other things.)

2018 2018-05-22 20:13:06 And when they did we say to them WTF Iran? How are we going to invade you now? So we end deal so we can invade. High oil price is good for USA and Russia. Everyone win. $$$ #maga #mrga $$$

2021 2018-05-22 20:12:57 I support the KM pipeline, if for no other reason than the fact it represents a higher price for Cdn. oil which is the one true way to cut consumption & trigger alternatives asap at home.
2022 2018-05-22 20:12:52 NEWS>>>OPEC MAY DECIDE TO RAISE OIL OUTPUT IN JUNE DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT VENEZUELA PRODUCTION DECLINE AND POSSIBLE IRAN OIL SUPPLY SHORTAGE - OPEC AND OIL INDUSTRY SOURCES

What  a F*C*ing lie. China is buying all Irans oils

2024 2018-05-22 20:12:42 Vote irregularities? The slaughter of 70+ demonstrators & injury of 1,300 in an act of inhuman excessive force by Israel goes without punishment.
This of course is not related to Venezuela's oil reserves being equal to that of Syria's. #Worlddomagenda
2025 2018-05-22 20:12:39 Dave. Let’s end this. You are utterly clueless and a major hazard to the environment. Block Cdn oil, call it a win (only idiots would buy that), demand keeps growing and oil is supplied elsewhere at 2-3x the emissions. Canada and Mother Nature lose. Well done.
2026 2018-05-22 20:12:36 BC doesn’t want Alberta’s Oil, but now they are suing us for said Oil. #makeupyourmind #oil #Alberta

2029 2018-05-22 20:12:17 Peppermint oil works best for me! You rub it on your temples, but not a lot because it’s strong.
2030 2018-05-22 20:12:09 Season everything! Have you tried on a salad? Mix with some slice green apple, tomatoes, dried oregano, olive oil, lemon juice, s&p delicious!
2031 2018-05-22 20:12:06 Every president has seen raising gas/oil prices for the past half-century, this is nothing new. Also, gas prices spike every summer so this is to be expected.
2032 2018-05-22 20:12:06 *checks oil in a public place to impress a nonexistent crowd*
2033 2018-05-22 20:12:02 We could have paid for our services and banked oil royalties.  Like, with tax dollars.  Then, when the bust cycles hit and tax revenue decreased, we could have used investment income from the Heritage Fund to continue to provide stable funding.
2034 2018-05-22 20:11:46 Seriously! get your facts right sir, making an illogical defence won't going to work. Why you are not mentioning how much global oil prices increased or decreased between 2004-2014 and 2014-2018, also about $ vs Rupees increase or decreased between the same period.+

2039 2018-05-22 20:10:54 Damn I’m ready to get the hell on, i hate coming out this bit for oil changes. Take too damn long
2040 2018-05-22 20:10:51 Victor, the nation you're referring to doesn't count b/c it's the global reserve currency & everyone needs their currency to pay for critical commodities...of course rapidly-rising CNY oil contract volumes post-Iran sanctions could change that rapidly (per Obama), but let's watch
2041 2018-05-22 20:10:50 I need that oil
2042 2018-05-22 20:10:38 @realDonaldTrump invade Venezuela .  Maduro Dictator more oil than Middle East big plus..people are starving
2043 2018-05-22 20:10:31 Many oil rigs still do a minute's silence for the Piper. The kids learn quickly.
Even arch-atheist me kept my gob firmly shut and thought about the victims as the rig shut down to sing hymns and lay a wreath overboard on the 30th anniversary of the Ocean Ranger.
2044 2018-05-22 20:10:29 I’m getting my oil changed it’s freakin hot in the car
2045 2018-05-22 20:10:28 @NAZCORP I agree, gold and miners seem to be affected by similar forces as oil
2046 2018-05-22 20:10:26 10 companies accounted for 2/3 of the Q1 increase; Tech, e.g. Alphabet building 19 data centres worldwide due to competition, Energy due to a rising oil price. Median S&P 500 increased modest 13 %.  Broader surveys suggested many businesses remained more hesitant. - FP
2047 2018-05-22 20:10:23 Thanks for cleaning ur fucking rig in the sink and leaving oil reclaim all over it :) I LOVE HOW OBSERVANT MEN ARE!!!!!! #SARCASM
2048 2018-05-22 20:10:07 You ain't ugly mate. No oil painting, but far away from ugly. We are both middle aged and I don't mind admitting I'm a bit worse for wear - the years take their toll, innit?! Anyway, enough, you ain't ugly :)
2049 2018-05-22 20:10:06 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
2050 2018-05-22 20:09:54 When their existential threat argument is dismissed then it becomes a question of relative risk at which point we have to consider the alternatives (like oil-by-rail and Saudi tankers in US waters). That argument does not go the Premier or Ms. May's way.
2051 2018-05-22 20:09:50 It's hilarious...it's like going back to my first year of trading physical oil...exact same commentary...
2052 2018-05-22 20:09:42 I mean... America is also about oil. Let's not kid ourselves
2053 2018-05-22 20:09:35 You laugh now, but I bet you've never emptied out your coffee filter on a plate and drizzled olive oil and feta on it.
2054 2018-05-22 20:09:34 It's very interesting. On one hand they don't want our oil, on the other hand they're suing because they want our oil. #bcpoli #abpoli

2063 2018-05-22 20:08:36 Wait. Its near 5 a gallon in NYC.  Iran 4th largest oil producer and we do not use all our oil domestically. If we. Did, our prices would fall.

2065 2018-05-22 20:08:25 Ms May and Premiere Horgan claim dilbit is impossible to clean up and worse than a heavy oil spill. That it represents and existential threat. This is the basis of their argument. This document demonstrates that their argument is not correct. It disproves their argument.

2069 2018-05-22 20:07:56 Too much oil that man... lol
2070 2018-05-22 20:07:55 Sad but this is the system we're maintaining. This will keep happening if we keep working to keep it moving. Killing today is profitable, the war economy has become a very real necessity of the establishment to maintain itself. This is the War for Oil.

2082 2018-05-22 20:05:06 Trivia Tuesday: Canola oil was originally called rapeseed oil, but renamed by the Canadian oil industry in 1978 to avoid negative connotations. "Canola" is short for "Canadian oil."
2083 2018-05-22 20:05:02 The oil trading chatroom is filling with Forex people now #OOTT   That is semi-regular (hat tip to Dan Jenkins) for this sort of day but the questions are, "What happened today?" ..."Why is is down?"  "When is API..hurry" and that sort of thing.

Nationalize our oil,

2093 2018-05-22 20:04:32 How come: you don't mention democracy and common values? You forgot to mention pipelines and bullish oil market discouraging warmongers.  You wrongly assess failed full-scale attack of Azeri forces in April 2016 as skirmish.
2094 2018-05-22 20:04:31 Oh no, what oil do you use ?
I never considered it to make me break out, but maybe it's why I had some spots  
Konjac Sponges have changed my life, the best scrub with no redness. And you can "adjust" the scrub by watering the konjac less.

2096 2018-05-22 20:04:23 seeds in general are often problematic, and sunflower oil comes from sunflower seeds

2098 2018-05-22 20:04:17 Retweeted Mhairi Hunter (@MhairiHunter):

"Oil has staged a remarkable rally in the last few weeks - prices are going above $80 a barrel.That is a three and a half year high."

2101 2018-05-22 20:04:04 BP are working hard on this stuff - they’ve decided they’re an energy company, not an oil one. Besides, they own a whole load of locations that drivers are used to going to in order to get energy in their cars.

2106 2018-05-22 20:03:03 $2,400 , three radiators, one timing belt, water pump, ac compressor and condenser, air filters, coolant flush, spark plugs, and one oil change later and it turns out my engine block is cracked 
2107 2018-05-22 20:02:55 And raise oil prices for his pal putin
2108 2018-05-22 20:02:54 When it comes to climate, if the test for leadership is, 'Who is further behind?,' the whole world will lose. Question must be: 'What is the level of ambition needed to achieve the Paris goals?' Leading a transition off oil production is where CA must step up (w/ ,,)
2109 2018-05-22 20:02:54 Trump rattled the oil markets with his never ending parade of foreign policy blunders and exploratory extortion. We should have 2 dollar gas instead of what we're stuck with. We should have an actual president instead of a mendacious buffoon.  Change is coming.
2110 2018-05-22 20:02:44 On that we agree. Thanks.
2111 2018-05-22 20:02:42 More hiring for what types of jobs and where? Nobody is seeing any significant life changes according to these replies. Why? What about our gas prices? If we are largely oil independent, why are our gas prices rising daily? Is it price gouging? #economy #GasPrices #jobs
2112 2018-05-22 20:02:39 if you don't like oil and you don't like water and wood and coal are bad I guess sunshine and compost will power your world tomorrow @CanadianGreens @ElizabethMay
2113 2018-05-22 20:02:38 I just want somebody to come grease/oil my scalp for me because I’m too lazy 
2114 2018-05-22 20:02:24 It was wrong to do so. We're saying we don't care about a peace deal being made.
2115 2018-05-22 20:02:19 It is truly strange to be on a conference call where the BC attorney general is talking about suing Alberta for a law, Bill 12, that would restrict exports of Alberta oil to B.C., which was a direct response to B.C.'s attempts to restrict oil imports from Alberta.
2116 2018-05-22 20:02:18 We have over 30 different sectors contributing to our GDP. That's diversified

However we have Oil as dominant source of govt revenue and forex

2127 2018-05-22 20:01:08 I agree. It is a very slow change, tho. In the meantime, commodities such as wheat and potash sit to make way for trains to carry oil and coal. Oil could easily go by pipe. Coal should be shut down.  And on, and...
2128 2018-05-22 20:01:07 They don’t belong. In drinks or food. Olive oil might be the only exception.

2130 2018-05-22 20:00:48 Maduro’s goose was nearly cooked because the country was broke. It’s been a failed state for a while, but rising oil prices (thanks to Trump) have given them a lifeline. The sanctions are meaningless because they can’t afford to buy anything anyway. And China will buy their oil.

Olive Oil's Healing Powers The people of early civilizations in the Arab World believed that olive oil would cure every illness known to man.
2140 2018-05-22 19:59:43 The move is more than symbolic. It is an outward expression of support beyond the symbolism of "saying" we support Israel and then doing nothing. That is why this was such as good move for the US and Israel.
2141 2018-05-22 19:59:42 @RachelNotley I didn’t vote for Horgan,but I support keeping horrific oil incidents out of our province&ecosystem.

2150 2018-05-22 19:58:37 1. Listening to @SecPompeo in the @StateDept presser you'd get the impression that he's been tough on #Iran. So far I've seen him complicit in genocide in #Afrin to help #Iran move problem al-Qaeda neighbors; help Iran steal Kurdish oil in Kirkuk & let Iran produce Plutonium.
2151 2018-05-22 19:58:37 That wiki page talks about SCOTLANDS Oil and Gas.. Scotlands exports.. UK NOT OK.

2153 2018-05-22 19:58:34 I had a DaimlerXJ, great inferior, smooth ride, but drank oil, sad to say, new engine after 6 months, my last new Brit car, the two tanks were fun, at filling station! Then it was LS400 which was engineering perfection.

2156 2018-05-22 19:58:17 Miss when my oil change was $35 fr tho 
2157 2018-05-22 19:58:11 Yes, I get oil treatments frequently and I use vitamin E oil in my hair.
2158 2018-05-22 19:58:04 Twitter has many tricks they use to stop truth! If you see big picture the idea is to setup overthrow of US ! Deplete oil,destroy water tables,use infiltrated troops to control civilians,shootings used to disarm civilians,media used to silence truth.Death camps soon!

2160 2018-05-22 19:57:43 México would be great if the governors wouldn't be so freaking corrupt, they never had an honest president for the people, they are elected and get filthy rich, México is rich in oil, gold, silver and Natural places, beaches and agricultural land but people work in vain.
2161 2018-05-22 19:57:42 Coconut oil  is da bomb 
2162 2018-05-22 19:57:31 The WH has nothing to do with it.
He's half the deal no matter what else he is.
It's a coin, not a worldwide declaration of absolution.

2165 2018-05-22 19:56:56 To gain support to go to war with a region whose main export is oil, which for economic reasons, is still our energy standard. So, few thousand nameless casualties and the green light to go to war? —> motive.
2166 2018-05-22 19:56:56 Protesters know nothing about oil and gas and how safe it is. @BlanchardSL #yyc
2167 2018-05-22 19:56:44 Finally got my oil change 
2168 2018-05-22 19:56:36 Because there was no progress with road construction or it was pathetic and most subsidy amount was eaten up by ministers or oil cos or retailers with no benefit to common man at all.
2169 2018-05-22 19:56:34 This is where u got it wrong.Nyantakyi met these investors in Dubai. They(investors) were seeking to invest in our oil & gas industry and not football. That's when the conversation ensued, and apparently Nyantakyi posed as a very close friend to the president who can assist them
2170 2018-05-22 19:56:28 I used to  wash my hair  twice a week and deep conditions once.. 

I used olive oil and coconut oil and braid it every night or sometimes I use wool to straighten It.. don't  make it too tight as it will affect your hairline..  that's all
2171 2018-05-22 19:56:25 Ohhh those are drizzled with truffle oil after they've been fried

2176 2018-05-22 19:56:06 We have provided abundant support--real support, not mere symbolism. There was no need to move the embassy.
2177 2018-05-22 19:56:02 Could do actually, but for best results use both oil and tin foil
2178 2018-05-22 19:55:59 Summer in effect this week. First grilled chicken with a fresh peach salsa, cilantro and cous cous. Next a watermelon and goat cheese appetizer with fresh basil and olive oil. Finally a blackened shrimp po boy with lettuce, tomato and remoulade. Served with fries.
2179 2018-05-22 19:55:58 The most important thing to solve in politics, beside the total corruption in government, is the problem of oil.  My engine solves this problem.  It also helps to solve the transportation problems, sanitation problems, water problems and many more.  Key to future.
2180 2018-05-22 19:55:51 I was getting an oil change and my dumbass didn’t even know how to pop the hood and the workers had to do it for me why do i even have a car LOL
2181 2018-05-22 19:55:48 Psst. Almond oil will help you grow thicker sleeker hair and it won’t clog the crap out of your pores. Achieve your dreams bro.
2182 2018-05-22 19:55:34 So you had to go and throw in the pickle!!! 
2183 2018-05-22 19:55:26 Yet they have no issue with Alaskan oil... seems a bit hypocritical...
2184 2018-05-22 19:55:23 what is hair oil ahahah
2185 2018-05-22 19:55:15 Was going to buy some Cheddars as a treat - then realised they contain palm oil, so changed my mind. @JacobsSnacks @pladis_Global if you change your recipe to something more sustainable, let me know. #palmoilalarmcall
2186 2018-05-22 19:54:57 We are like oil and water. I settle lazily on the bottom and she floats on top... occasionally catches fire... burns the house down.
2187 2018-05-22 19:54:53 That's a bigger problem for B2C (#Dabur #Pidilite #VIPIndustries #TataGlobal #BajajElectricals are few in my folio - am braced!)

For B2B like #Nocil Oil rise usually is a pass-on to the customer and so is Oil price softening (subject to contract clause)
2188 2018-05-22 19:54:39 exactlyyyyy, fuckin car oil in a bottle
2189 2018-05-22 19:54:29 @jjhorgan Respected Sir, I  understand your viewpoint but you are putting BC ahead of Canada.  If you are not ready to accept the pipeline and related risks then Alberta has every right not to supply the oil. Can't just be fair weather bird
2190 2018-05-22 19:54:27 National review is an oil funded source with weighted conservative views. So, you have your source and I have mine. It makes sense being that your based on oil country!
2191 2018-05-22 19:54:23 The BC gov't is making a court challenge that undermines their own position on Kinder Morgan that seeks to regulate the flow of oil. Guess that's one way to cut through the dead wood.
2192 2018-05-22 19:54:07 Just chew it up like you did with the oil can
2193 2018-05-22 19:53:56 No. they are giving stupid reason that the increase per year in Manmohan government is larger than increase per year in Modi government and they are not showing the fact of Crude oil.

2198 2018-05-22 19:53:28 I don’t remember what happened the last 2 times I drank that damn Nupe Juice  or Que Oil. Lmao STAY AWAY FROM IT!
2199 2018-05-22 19:53:27 No, the Alberta advantage was built on insane natural gas revenues (and a bunch of oil) #abpoli
2200 2018-05-22 19:53:15 For the longest time, I thought he called his flagship snake oil “BrainFarce”. But that would’ve been too honest.
2201 2018-05-22 19:53:11 Our report lays out a plan for ramping down the massive oil and gas production in California in a managed way. California -- and Gov. Brown -- can set a global precedent of leadership for others to follow. Afterall, that's what #GCAS2018 is about -- leadership.
2202 2018-05-22 19:53:09 Actually Get me on my holibobs I can’t wait to sizzle my life away drowned head 2 toe in a bottle of oil
2203 2018-05-22 19:53:04 I've been jerking off with coconut oil and now my balls smell like a pina colada.
2204 2018-05-22 19:53:00 Naaaaaaaah....mayonnaise is literally made from egg yellow, A WHOLE LOT OF OIL and vinegar.
...that stuff is hella fatty and unhealthy.

2205 2018-05-22 19:52:57 I truly didn’t know how good coconut oil was for hair! 

I’ve slept with it in my hair 2 times & I can already tell how much it’s helped my hair  

10/10 recommend
2206 2018-05-22 19:52:55 I suppose counterclaim is the wrong word. BC says we can't stop their oil as it is not constitutional when BC is doing the same thing and claiming it is.
2207 2018-05-22 19:52:50 I disagree. As long as Israel's allies did not support her, she remained weakened, surrounded by a sea of enemies. Doing this strengthens Israel's claim, a claim that should never have been in dispute in the first place.
2208 2018-05-22 19:52:45 Bring your cars to South América please, in Uruguay we have great electricity production and we need new cars, oil is too expensive down Here.

2209 2018-05-22 19:52:27 I use an oil based cleanser then a water based cleanser cleanser, moisturizer, eye cream and I try to do a sheet mask every now and then and I do a face mask once a week
2210 2018-05-22 19:52:19 I DO! I haven’t used lotion in years, coconut oil and she’s butter.. 
but after my shower I didn’t re-moisturize
2211 2018-05-22 19:52:15 Interesting washinglon post 
The oil prices are even high by a dollar par gallon that’s abt Rs 17 par Litter in US itself & there comes the revolutionary Mohammed Ali from Madison Sqare talking abt impact of Petrol prices in India 
2212 2018-05-22 19:52:01 Wonder who sets the price of oil. And They can’t print money to pay debt like US can. While petro $ thing.
2213 2018-05-22 19:51:59 Dr. Feisty, would you ever recommend to your patients CBD oil from a reputable company? It can do wonders for chronic pain, anxiety, PTSD, seizures, etc.
2214 2018-05-22 19:51:35 The plunge in output productivity along with falling oil prices globally led to the collapse of the backbone of Venezuelan economy. Now we are here. And some people actually think Maduro can make it all better. That the dumb oaf can end the corruption he exacerbated.
2215 2018-05-22 19:51:27 Oil curve has been behaving bearishly all day..
2216 2018-05-22 19:51:11 Won’t be surprised if WTI is above $80 by the next #OPEC meting on June 22 in #Austria— definitely something to watch for between now and then as #oil bears will run rampant with any speculation that OPEC waters down the so-called cuts. Short-lived plunge..
2217 2018-05-22 19:51:07 I find konjac sponges and coconut oil (I saw you use pure oil too) help to remove eyeliner that stain the eye area !
I hope it will help you and your eyes 
2218 2018-05-22 19:50:46 I've always respected Musk for saying he's going to do something that everyone says can't be done, then puts his $$$ where his mouth is and does it. Complete disregard for the big oil companies, gas and electric companies, etc. Dude is a constant forward thinker and we need more.
2219 2018-05-22 19:50:45 the only things women can't do that men can are start wars over oil and riot about sports
2220 2018-05-22 19:50:35 A lot of weird & wonderful price action going on in front and back of the #crude #oil curve - despite the physical diffs and in-spite of #OPEC headlines. #OOTT
2221 2018-05-22 19:50:30 Proposal:

1) read the tweets.  This engine solves the oil problem.  Decide if you want to help.

2) Help me find the right people to work with to get this engine done faster. 

3) Make me offer I can't refuse for contact(s).  Negotiable.

4) We meet up.  Sign.  

5) Meet contact
2222 2018-05-22 19:50:25 Black patches on my cracked phone screen, looks like crude oil deposits. Get to me before America does
2223 2018-05-22 19:49:59 And again, many parties in Israel take the same attitude.

In any case, I return to my original point. While the conflict is unsettled, moving our embassy was ill-advised and certainly not needed.
2224 2018-05-22 19:49:51 Conversely, the province that wants federal law to govern oil exports enacts provincial law governing said oil exports. It cuts both ways when you frame it like that.

2235 2018-05-22 19:48:04 Mostly, yes. Idea to cancel cemented when Alberta passed the bill to restrict oil & gas shipments to BC. I will spend my tourist dollars elsewhere.
2236 2018-05-22 19:48:03 Well I'm upset, as if you couldn't tell. No investigation and news is focused on Trump. Congress is the governing body. Republicans are too busy lining their pockets with Rubles and oil money.
2237 2018-05-22 19:48:02 Iran signs treaty.  Embargo their oil lifted.  Russia losses trillion the kind people in Saudi arabia looses trillion. Gas prices go down.  Now walking away from treaty. Oil is going up an Putin, israel, saudis, happy American people screwed.  #fbr #bluewave2018

2244 2018-05-22 19:46:24 Given the summit is being hosted in California, it's reasonable to look at what's going on here. Of course, as outlined in the report, California has taken important steps on climate. But ignoring the massive oil and gas production in the state undermines its own actions.

2246 2018-05-22 19:45:56 At the time of UPA oil prices were shooting up externally and thus the increase. Since 2014 oil prices collapsed internationally but hardly any benefits in India. Now petrol prices are on upward curve, so increasing prices. Should have moved down to INR  40 before coming to 76.
2247 2018-05-22 19:45:52 Oil
2248 2018-05-22 19:45:50 You realise the oil in the proposed pipeline is for foreign markets right?  We clearly already have a way to get oil to BC from Alberta.  The current challenge is correct in that it isn't constitutional to pull this crap.  @RachelNotley needs to smarten up.
2249 2018-05-22 19:45:40 Where should I take my car for an oil change? I’m finding out the place I went to for $10 oil changes is sketchy so yeah 
2250 2018-05-22 19:45:27 fair enough, but you better oil up! or you'll start rusting :P
2251 2018-05-22 19:45:26 Don't upgrade sir, already oil prices are dancing on our head.

Where the problem could possibly not be resolved! told to have an oil change when last had one in January with a service!
2254 2018-05-22 19:45:20 You had it until the CIA and British oil companies overthrew it so go somewhere else for help

2271 2018-05-22 19:42:45 Butter or drizzle of oil?

2278 2018-05-22 19:42:13 We have more oil in the US to keep us going for a very long time. Instead we sell the majority of it overseas and then import what we use. Makes no damn sense. Why fracking, dril, offshore if we aren't going to use it. SMDH.

2282 2018-05-22 19:41:50 Again, the Palestinian Authority no longer endorses that goal. And there are parties in Israel that refuse to acknowledge any Palestinian claims on any of the territory.
2283 2018-05-22 19:41:31 Tengok video pasal skincare ni baru terasa nak pakai oil kat muka 
2284 2018-05-22 19:41:18 Both great, especially with grilled hallumi, bread & olive oil 
2285 2018-05-22 19:41:12 I think I'm dying someone bring me food I'm stuck while my car's oil is being changed
2286 2018-05-22 19:41:10 Iran trades its oil for euro, not for $, so they shoul be punished, that's the message.

Where do you think longs hv their stops set 
2288 2018-05-22 19:41:02 Lol it’s taking waaay longer than I thought. I think im going to start using oil on them
2289 2018-05-22 19:41:02 #MishnaYomi #Ktuvot 13:4 Admon: Claim owed jars of oil, defendant admits to empty jars; defendant takes oath, as admitting part of claim.
2290 2018-05-22 19:40:56 यह पत्रकार है कि हजाम इंटरनेशनल मार्केट में crude oil का प्राइस क्या चल रहा है तेरे अब्बा को बोल तेरे को समझाए..
2291 2018-05-22 19:40:50 I’ve got an essential oil for you, @SirJustinS
2292 2018-05-22 19:40:38 people can call it fake all they want but i’m pro essential oil medicine. truthfully you all should try it #youngliving
2293 2018-05-22 19:40:36 Mr. Huber is burning the midnight oil.

2295 2018-05-22 19:40:11 Yeah all the OIH oil services stocks getting decimated. Wonder what happened.
2296 2018-05-22 19:40:09 If your tan is patchy, use micellar oil infused cleansing water to get rid of the tan, you’re welcome x
2297 2018-05-22 19:40:08 Family Nutrition: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this May? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
2298 2018-05-22 19:40:04 If you love your country, then you need my engine.  Serious.  Sending money to terrorists is like paying for your execution.  Why do it when you don't have to?  The better choice is to help me find people who want to solve this oil problem and do R&D to make it happen.
2299 2018-05-22 19:40:03 We have plenty of our own oil here in the US but they keep selling it overseas and buying high priced oil. SMDH. What is the use of fracking, offshore drilling if we are not going to use it ourselves.
2300 2018-05-22 19:40:01 Don't forget that it's perfect for Russia as their economy is heavily dependent on the price of oil.
2301 2018-05-22 19:39:44 @thechew Just an FYI for Clinton Kelley.  If you use essential oils at home and have pets, be very careful.  Eucalyptus oil is toxic to pets. 

Make sure your oils are safe for pets before using them.
2302 2018-05-22 19:39:37 yall my birthday has been wild so far, things i've done today include:

2303 2018-05-22 19:39:28 May God Anoint us with true Anointing. The Gospel of selling Handkerchiefs and Oil and sweeping Broom.and Honey is not From God is purely pervasion Repent and turn To God
2304 2018-05-22 19:39:27 There's a difference between chemistry and simply naming something.  I was told by an oil industry proponent that 'tar sands' is a term from industry.  I'm open to reading any sources on this.  In the end, it's a branding exercise.  I'm sticking with tar sands.
2305 2018-05-22 19:39:25 do you use toner before you put the oil on??
2306 2018-05-22 19:39:23 Original listerine, pink Oil of Olay, and damp wool. Tomato leaves, the remnants of yesterday’s curried horses, and morning dew. Sawdust, hops, and honeysuckle. New ink in art books.

2308 2018-05-22 19:39:16 Getting my oil changed and I can hear them laughing at my skid plate being held on with zip ties like.. I drive a FIAT.. in MANITOBA.. have you experienced our winters and our roads? It’s pretty self explanatory lol
2309 2018-05-22 19:39:12 I kinda want to make it with a bit of jojoba and apricot kernel oil
2310 2018-05-22 19:39:12 Milk Makeup $10 off code MMU-W6LT-NPLC-6X42-WVVS for that Kush Mascara with cannabis oil in it. it’s great. go get it.
2311 2018-05-22 19:39:09 CBD oil no longer DEA controlled so surprised California can do that, but it’s a long drive to Nevada from LA to get it cheaper. 
2312 2018-05-22 19:39:03 I’m getting my oil changed rn and the dude was trying to get someone to pull up but he was on his phone not paying attention, so the mechanic walked over to the dudes whip and he was watching porn  yoooo I’m so dead rn 
2313 2018-05-22 19:39:02 @realDonaldTrump How come all the winning doesn't extend to the gas pumps? Or maybe it does......for Big Oil. How come those HUGE tax cuts weren't enough for them? I guess for every winner there has to be a loser.
2314 2018-05-22 19:38:55 T eats eba very very well but will always cry and reject mashed potatoes & egg yolk. 
How will a child use his hand to reject being an ajebutter?

I have to keep trying the mashed potatoes. With prayer&anointing oil so I can bind out this kpako spirit from his father’s village
2315 2018-05-22 19:38:50 my bf told me i had to choose between gettin my nails done or gettin an oil change  cause he ain payin for both. tf

2317 2018-05-22 19:38:48 @realDonaldTrump Another Trump scam...have u seen rising gas, oil, and healthcare
2318 2018-05-22 19:38:34 No. We didn't build our welfare state on oil. And the "smoke" in the image is water vapour.
2319 2018-05-22 19:38:28 I’m the same with California and I’m almost 59 years old and have been to multiple countries
2320 2018-05-22 19:38:22 your car is german. your vodka is russian. your democracy is greek. your oil is saudi arabian. your coffee is brazilian. your tea is tamil. your numbers are arabic, your letters latin.  and you’re complaining about your neighbor being an immigrant?
2321 2018-05-22 19:38:19 Oil following
2322 2018-05-22 19:38:15 Have you ever tried the LCO method? Adding the oil at the end may give you the definition you are looking for.
2323 2018-05-22 19:38:07 Fatalities aren’t part of the economic equation - they’re not considered important enough. They’re simply a byproduct of achieving access to resources (oil, coal, minerals) which can be justified if the profit to be made is reasonable enough.
2324 2018-05-22 19:37:56 Typical topic change for an oil supporter
2325 2018-05-22 19:37:51 But tea tree oil.
2326 2018-05-22 19:37:49 Do you like Oil and Gas?
2327 2018-05-22 19:37:48 Would you please shut up and go be an oil lobbyist or something?
2328 2018-05-22 19:37:47 The Niffler is in love with Rose Boheme oil from @zoetbathlatier and was so sad to finish up our bottle, worried we wouldn't be able to find it again. So excited to see that there'll be a shop opening in Malvern!
2329 2018-05-22 19:37:39 as if my day couldn’t get any worse, just realised I’ve slathered my face in out-of-date coconut oil and I’m not talking a couple of weeks out of date, I’m talking november 2016 out of date

2335 2018-05-22 19:37:15 Beyond Amazing..  kinda of tragic too.. oil burn? Chemicals in our Oceans
2336 2018-05-22 19:36:57 I’m so excited!!

I made my first batch of soap with avocado oil instead of olive oil.

It looks so rich and creamy and it smells amazing!!

I can’t wait til it’s ready!!!
2337 2018-05-22 19:36:50 We know your plan.. It's all about a war for oil. Sadly the US will have few allies in this nonsense.
2338 2018-05-22 19:36:49 The USA is the biggest terrorist in the middle East. Nobody has killed more, overturned more govts and stolen more oil.
2339 2018-05-22 19:36:48 Getting my oil changed makes me feel like such an adult until they ask me what kind I want and I just stare them blankly

2345 2018-05-22 19:36:04 elon musk as a “hero” gets lost in translation to me when i see oil&gas employees benefit from rising gas prices while driving around Teslas and then i see  other cars stopped on the side of 45 bc they can’t afford to fill up their tanks ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2346 2018-05-22 19:35:50 Microwave is better, Hot frying pan with hot groundnut oil lo worst.
2347 2018-05-22 19:35:39 $ENSV oil play initial alert 1.06  now 1.41 - great conviction by @JeffWiz_BG on this play.  I exited too soon!
2348 2018-05-22 19:35:32 could maybe use that oil.......
2349 2018-05-22 19:35:28 It might have to do with American foreign policies dictated by Israel and Saudi Arabia. Canada has little power regarding oil prices. Do you suggest we should cut taxes and have a bigger deficit?
2350 2018-05-22 19:35:24 “Oil absorbing sheets and trash” I’d give them a listen.
2351 2018-05-22 19:35:22 turmeric + avocado + coconut oil
2352 2018-05-22 19:35:18 My brother in law took my truck for an oil change the other day and I asked him how much it costs and he goes “it’s a gift to that poor truck...”
2353 2018-05-22 19:34:59 Seen it on TV news at Alabama election. A guy showed his drivers license showing he was from another state and voted in Alabama.
2354 2018-05-22 19:34:53 The best CBD salve and vape oil I have ever used!!! It works so fast on my knees when the arthritis is acting up. Also, it is so relaxing to vape in the evenings. This is not cannabis but hemp derived so no need to worry about drug testing.
2355 2018-05-22 19:34:51 you're telling me... lol researching drains the money and hunting for Columbia drains the oil ;;
2356 2018-05-22 19:34:49 Nevertheless I thought the silent generation was GenX !!! Well maybe the invisible generation. But yes I get it... This generation thing might be same as fish oil for the heart = bonkers

2359 2018-05-22 19:34:07 So the province that wants to ban shipments of Alberta oil now wants yo launch a court case against Alberta for NOT sending the oil in a pipeline? #SillyNDP

2361 2018-05-22 19:34:03 So let’s get this straight!! We will sell Alberta oil to the US because BC blocks pipelines, then BC buys oil from the US. Ergo they buy Alberta oil at an inflated price!! Karma is a beatch!!
2362 2018-05-22 19:34:02 Oil field baby
2363 2018-05-22 19:33:46 I ain't ate nothing ALL DAY! Look like a trip to Potbelly's is in order. Big Italian, with extra capocola lettuce, tomato mayo, oil, and Italian seasoning please. And make the chips regular with a Nantucket Nectar. Yep. That's what I'm on.

2365 2018-05-22 19:33:36 I just put on rosehip oil, jojoba oil, tea tree oil & vitamin c serum .. Hoping this combo helps to improve my skin 
2366 2018-05-22 19:33:32 Palestine still wants to eradicate Israel. That hasn’t changed.
2367 2018-05-22 19:33:30 Makes sense, Not. Don't send your oil through BC in a pipeline, but Don't cut us off send more gasoline for us to burn in our fancy cars in downtown Vancouver. Hipocrisy at its best! #bcpoli #KinderMorgan
2368 2018-05-22 19:33:28 Just start tanning naked .. and use oil lol
2369 2018-05-22 19:33:24 I’m convinced my hair just eats up oil ... I oil my hair everyday now.
2370 2018-05-22 19:33:23 Venezuela is a major producer of oil. Hates the US. Is a major supplier of
oil to America's enemies. We take over the country, we can stop the supply 
of oil to those who wish us harm.
2371 2018-05-22 19:33:22 But the curde oil prices during UPA was crazily high when compared to $25-30 per barrel now
2372 2018-05-22 19:33:18 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.
2373 2018-05-22 19:33:08 Hey Trump, Venezuela got oil. Why is not the American military there already and killing people like you still are in Iran/Iraq? Is it not Americas job to "rescue" these natural resources... I mean people from dictatorship? #FreeVenezuela @realDonaldTrump @POTUS

2376 2018-05-22 19:33:05 try creating a spray with a little water, conditioner and oil. A little more moisture may make your curls spring back to life after a night of beauty sleep.
2377 2018-05-22 19:33:03 OPEC functions on a limited resource, oil. Knowledge, books & many products can be manufactured & mass produced. With the internet, cyber products like computer files can be mass produced by only consuming a little electricity.
AGAIN you change the context!
2378 2018-05-22 19:33:01 The oil barons will not like this.
2379 2018-05-22 19:32:55 Oh yeah! And how about the miles fields of oil rig equipment?
2380 2018-05-22 19:32:46 Wearing a crop top sweater and cooking is a no no. My pansa just got burned from the oil popping.  
2381 2018-05-22 19:32:44 Is adulthood just telling yourself everyday, “I’ll get an oil change and new brake pads after work today,” realizing you’re on a ramen-for-lunch-and-dinner budget, and then never getting it done?

Hang in there, squeaky PT Cruiser. We don’t have the budget for you to break down.
2382 2018-05-22 19:32:10 Good thing it's not up to you.
You demonstrate a total lack of knowledge.  You just don't like guns and "feel" nobody should have one.
2383 2018-05-22 19:32:00 Goal: Grab #Iran Oil & Gas? ,
2384 2018-05-22 19:31:59 The NDP threatened legal action ultimately to attempt to restrict oil flowing into BC from Alberta but also threaten legal action in the event Alberta attempts to restricts the flow of oil into BC.  No wonder this BC NDP lacks positive relations with other governments.
2385 2018-05-22 19:31:55 I love majority of all veggies, been a veggie kid all my life..

2397 2018-05-22 19:30:18 We'll never see oil in the 60s ever again. (Channeling my inner Gartman)
2398 2018-05-22 19:30:14 Actually, Han gets his dice after buying an oil change at a service station on Dantooine.
2399 2018-05-22 19:30:11 Stimulus to minimize #tax on #gasoline has been growing lately in an effort to contain the increase mainly derived by #oil prices, is this really the best way to expend public money? What will happen if #IEPS goes negative?
2400 2018-05-22 19:30:10 In terms of childhood and hair @CanterBame , my mum used to use brylcreem / Johnson’s baby oil and it wouldn’t get washed for a couple of days but I used to have the most beautiful thick hair (it was my mum’s pride and glory, I didn’t actually care lol)
2401 2018-05-22 19:30:07 Olive oil is good stuff tho.
2402 2018-05-22 19:30:00 America is great because you can get an oil drum of Diet Coke for 79¢ at any gas station
2403 2018-05-22 19:29:49 Nagka giyera ba noong pumalag ang mga Vietnamese sa paglagay ng China ng oil rig sa dagat ng Vietnam?

Nagka giyera ba noong nagpahayag ng statement ang Vietnam na nag oobligang tanggalin ng China ang misile sa Spratly

Nagka gyera ba nang pinasabog ng Indonesia mga vesels ng CH
2404 2018-05-22 19:29:46 but with all the geopolitical concerns revolving around North Korea and Iran, oil had a small pullback, and has charged higher since. (continued)
2405 2018-05-22 19:29:38 The Six-day War was well before the peace process of the 90s. Things have changed since 1967.
2406 2018-05-22 19:29:36 I put way too much oil on my hair now my whole face is oily.... 
2407 2018-05-22 19:29:30 Since making its low in January of 2016 oil has risen over 80%. I set a $75.00 target on crude oil over 2 1/2 months ago, and two weeks ago when it traded above $71.00, I said I thought it was ‘topping out’, (continued)
2408 2018-05-22 19:29:30 Yeah that's trade/ barter. Not much good in today's economy. My point is, you really don't understsnd how money in the economy works. It's like oil in a car, someone has to put it in. The analogy of a bath with plug out is good, depending on how much the taps are turned on.
2409 2018-05-22 19:29:30  and you think Nigeria has a say on the price of oil.  I now understand how people believed the vague promises of APC

1: get a better pan
2: use butter
3: SET THE OIL ON FIRE

2417 2018-05-22 19:28:53 If OPEC cuts oil production in June will this drive oil prices and @BP_plc even higher?

2419 2018-05-22 19:28:28 EM's nearly all growth since 2009, China nearly half of this.  And yet consensus is CNY oil contract will never amount to much on any investable time horizon.  Fascinating that so many self-professed capitalists would think capitalism will fail in this case (big buyer sets terms)

2422 2018-05-22 19:28:04 Palestine will never come to a deal. All or nothing.  In 1967, they gave the 3 no's:
No peace with Israel 
No recognition of Israel
No negotiations with Israel 

And their final communication was that they would destroy the state of Israel. And then there was the 6 day war.

2426 2018-05-22 19:27:32 The olive oil one
2427 2018-05-22 19:27:27 Hard to figure this out. Horgan wants to control what's in oil pipeline but says Notley cannot.
2428 2018-05-22 19:27:23 They don’t want our oil in tankers so how can they want our oil in gas tanks and furnaces (and thousands of other petroleum based daily use articles)? That’s kinda hypocritical!

2431 2018-05-22 19:26:54 Perhaps you should first explain what you think a standard oil spill response would look like with the Alaskan tankers you have ignored and then how that response would change if it were dilbit. What do you think the recovery rate for an American tanker spilling near you?

2437 2018-05-22 19:26:12 Helpful tips for oil & gas schedulers, #OOTT   If you are a scheduler & want to build your relationship w/ traders on the oil & natgas desks, simply go over to one and ask, "What day & year did (oil/natural gas) start trading on the Nymex (now the CME)? You should know, right?""

2442 2018-05-22 19:25:35 I believe he was chosen specifically for his ties to the oil industry. Hand picked to destroy the EPA. No other reason makes sense. This is a planned deconstruction of our institutions that protect us by the greedy GOP and Koch.

2448 2018-05-22 19:24:51 The suspension is shot and the ball things are loose and I need an oil change.
2449 2018-05-22 19:24:48 it is not about nuclear weapons! it is about Israel and its territorial expansion! that's all! maybe oil is inside the objectives besides this there is nothing hidden under the sun!

2451 2018-05-22 19:24:46 Just finished watching a 9-11 documentary.  First, I was touched by the selfless bravery of the NYPD and FDNY. Then I got pissed all over again about how conspiracy shitheads exploit their sacrifice to try to peddle their intellectual snake oil. #BlowMe

2460 2018-05-22 19:23:02 Might as well get this oil change out the way first
2461 2018-05-22 19:23:02 Today was futures expiration hence the both sides on oil / that down sell brought the stocks with it that we up on the short squeeze
2462 2018-05-22 19:22:58 And Secrets  stolen
2463 2018-05-22 19:22:57 Yes, Russia will no longer be an a*hole country if they can get the price of oil up to $100/barrel again.
USA saw what happened when price of oil rose in July 2008.  USA truckers had to pay more. So USA goods hauled cost more. And USA people didn't go out to restaurants, malls.
2464 2018-05-22 19:22:53 Im not saying some aren't slightly better than others, but with my understanding it seems a little odd to be like 'olive oil is good for you and any others are awful for you and make you fat'
2465 2018-05-22 19:22:50 You’ll often hear it said that we have auto manufacturing for that. Which overlooks that we have to import a massive amount of parts into the country to make the cars out of.  Not so crude oil. It’s all made right here.

2470 2018-05-22 19:22:12 A lot of oil majors used that view to cut major capex projects and even sell off some assets and so a lot may have missed the boat
2471 2018-05-22 19:22:11 Someone gave me like natural sunscreen and it has coconut oil and I don’t like putting normal sunscreen on my face :/
2472 2018-05-22 19:22:02 Plus as far as I'm aware the reason different oils are used in cooking is because different oils have different smoke points. Olive oil's is very low whereas other oils have much higher ones, so they're used in cooking that needs higher temperatures.
2473 2018-05-22 19:21:43 I use coconut oil and activated charcoal and it whitens teeth so well. Nontoxic and very mild. It isn't gross at all. Love when natural products work better than the chemical counterparts.
2474 2018-05-22 19:21:29 Hi Sanjay! You have a very good memory! Yes, I am the same person, I am afraid lol!Oil, jeez!! Not disturbing me at all. How are you? :)

2477 2018-05-22 19:21:20 Nutrition Tip: Enjoy the Health Benefits of Coconut Oil

Coconut oil has benefits ranging from helping with fat loss, to boosting the immune system and improving bone density.  Not to mention it's the healthiest oil to cook with.  If you haven't switched to coconut oil, DO IT!
2478 2018-05-22 19:21:18 Im allergic to flowers but it took 5 months of super bad breakups & acne to FINALLY realize that rose oil & rose water actually had roses in it 
2479 2018-05-22 19:21:09 Thanks! I have all these ingredients. I use coconut oil in my hair
2480 2018-05-22 19:21:08 The only thing that can stop a bad guy with an oil is a good guy with an oil
2481 2018-05-22 19:21:02 As far as I'm aware that isn't exactly true. While those may be benefits of olive oil, other oils all have supposed benefits too, like sunflower oil for neuro function from omegas 3+6. They all have around the same amount of calories too, so the obesity thing I don't get?
2482 2018-05-22 19:21:00 I know that the Palestinians have been difficult to work with, but Israel is also not helping by continuing to build settlements on disputed land. And with no deal in place, moving our embassy should have come later.
2483 2018-05-22 19:20:57 Honda tryna play me. All I came for was an oil change. Dude gone tell me my breaks messed up, my tires need to be rotated, my windshield wipers need to be replaced, and I need new air filters....

2496 2018-05-22 19:19:58 Canada is not even on this list!! But Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Uruguay are on this list!! This is a disappointment! Canadians must rally and demand our government support renewable energy sources! Alberta wants our province (our country) to just rely on oil!!
2497 2018-05-22 19:19:56 ## But Share Market Ludak gaya,due to OPEC's Monopoly Brent Crude Oil Price is rising up everyday. Moreover Rupee is weakening and Dollar is becoming Stronger everyday.
2498 2018-05-22 19:19:52 Perhaps you should first explain what you think a standard oil spill response would look like and then how that response would change if it were dilbit. What do you think the recovery rate for an American tanker spilling at Anacortes would look like? Then that same in a storm?
2499 2018-05-22 19:19:46 When they finally realize their oil monopolies will soon be worthless.
2500 2018-05-22 19:19:39 They’re suing us because they want oil but they don’t want oil which is why this whole things started.

2504 2018-05-22 19:19:21 Hamas is in charge of Gaza. The Palestinian Authority is more interested in a deal. Perhaps a three-state solution is what's needed.
2505 2018-05-22 19:19:18 People in my generation hardly even know how to use salt and pepper  you don't need some crazy fb recipe, skillet oil/butter, salt and pepper, veggies meat. Cooking is science but not rocket science
2506 2018-05-22 19:19:17 However, most important is 
no palm oil because when we use palm oil, it destroys animals' homes. Thank you for listening to all of us.
2507 2018-05-22 19:19:16 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
2508 2018-05-22 19:19:11 But Israel is not the one denying a 2 state solution. 5 times Palestine has denied the offer to become a state. For them, it is all or nothing. And every time an offer has been thrown out, they have said no and started either a war or terrorosm.
2509 2018-05-22 19:19:03 Did she say it with a straight face? Were only doomed because 90% of all revenue from oil goes to Westmonster!

2542 2018-05-22 19:15:38 Once you realize sanctions really just means “We are using US political and economic power to penalize you because you you’re not using the Pedro-Dollar to sell oil so you can do your own thing as a country without America up your ass”, things get a little more interesting.

2544 2018-05-22 19:15:16 Hi Pooja,

I am sorry that, by forcing oil to be traded/mined only by public sectors, and not opening it to private sector, I may have missed 70 yrs of FINDING hydrocarbon deposits under India. Who knows ? India could have become Saudi Arabia.

Yours truly

2546 2018-05-22 19:15:09 @PMOIndia Sir, where is Acche Din???? Petrol and diseal Prices are Rocket high. Oil company cheated Indian people. Petrol should be Rs

2547 2018-05-22 19:14:57 Much respect for Ghassan Ben-Jeddo & the folks @AlMayadeenNews, they were the only one of the leading Arabic media outlets with enough professionalism, integrity & self-respect to not cover the filthy, racist family's #RoyalWedding. The Oil & Gas media were all over it.

2549 2018-05-22 19:14:43 .@Dave_Eby denies #BC government has stalled permit approvals for #TransMountain pipeline expansion. He says key issue remains protection of our coast from a "catastrophic oil spill" and still hopes this will go to #Canada's highest court. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #KinderMorgan

Ew, how about having three Hershey's minis instead - same calories but real food...
2551 2018-05-22 19:14:35 I just mixed rose water, a little ACV, and jojoba oil and sprayed my scalp. My scalp feels so much better.
2552 2018-05-22 19:14:32 Don't miss Inside Shale every Tues at 8AM!  This morning's show featured Greg Kozera w/ Shale Crescent speaking about his presentation today to the Oil & Gas Com. on the IHS Markit Study. "This study shows we're the most profitable place in the world for a petrochemical plant."

2561 2018-05-22 19:13:56 OW! NO BITING! Oil is pretty nonthreatening.
2562 2018-05-22 19:13:55 OPEC has minimal spare capacity. The fact traders are allowing them to jawbone oil markets is unbelievable.

2568 2018-05-22 19:13:24 Since my face has decided to break out every day for a week now, I've started my emergency tea tree oil regiment (which often helps with the worst of it) and lawwwwd every time I forget how diabolically this shit stinks. All my clothes smell of it. My pillow. Everything.

2575 2018-05-22 19:12:57 Strange how Eck bangs on about ‘oooor oil’ yet keeps his trap shut (difficult I know) and never utters a word about ‘oooor debt’.
2576 2018-05-22 19:12:57 It could be enormously helpful. So few people even understand that soap is made from fat....let alone the devastation caused by palm oil. Understanding where things come from is the first step to informed choices.

2583 2018-05-22 19:11:54 It can actually lower your blood pressure and prevent heart diseases, whilst e.g sunflower oil has a lot of calories in just one tablespoon, and is super unhealthy (there is a reason dieticians and doctors recommend olive oil!!)
2584 2018-05-22 19:11:53 No one told you what to do after you put baby oil on to remove fake tan did they? How long do you wait? Where can I sit? I ended up sliding round my bathroom like I was on the celeb cyclone on I'm a celeb
2585 2018-05-22 19:11:51 something about dipping bread into olive oil

2590 2018-05-22 19:11:10 This is Israel’s ancient and modern homeland. You cannot have a two-state solution when the other state wants to eradicate you.  This isn’t on Israel, but on Palestine.

2596 2018-05-22 19:10:48 Give me a Break Oil!
2597 2018-05-22 19:10:44 It is a particularly gruesome betrayal to yourself, whenever you sacrifice your psychological and emotional health to keep friends who are no more excited by your presence in their lives, as a moth is by a dead oil lamp.
2598 2018-05-22 19:10:30 Why didn’t I know that valvoline is the most expensive place to get your oil changed?  
2599 2018-05-22 19:10:30 Did you just assume someone's sexuality from a picture?  It was a slur on a person's masculinity not their sexuality.
2600 2018-05-22 19:10:28 Glad to see that snake oil is still in style. This is beyond ridiculous.  Drinking cabbage regrows limbs and reverses homosexuality.  Hilarious. #drphil
2601 2018-05-22 19:10:25 U.S. oil benchmark futures prices end with modest loss
2602 2018-05-22 19:10:24 Y'all see the reason we keep telling you to get a match venue every matchday of the @LMCNPFL? So many talents in this country, but our selfish government won't still understand that SPORT is a big revenue than oil or agriculture.
2603 2018-05-22 19:10:24 Stagnant? Might wan’t to check the actual numbers buddy and stop reciting what you hear on tv. The economy was getting better with what he put into motion but like all things it takes time. There is no one key fix all even if thats the snake oil the republicans sell you.
2604 2018-05-22 19:10:23 LOLL castor oil and shea butter but you on the right track
2605 2018-05-22 19:10:20 おにーさんにまかせとけー！

2607 2018-05-22 19:10:05 I don't see that as aid, since it encourages Israel to continue refusing to move toward a two-state solution.
2608 2018-05-22 19:10:01 So I took something from my skin care regimen & added 2 new steps . Vitamin E oil & coconut oil , I knew it worked but I wish I added these 2 wayyyyyy earlier . I’m in love 
2609 2018-05-22 19:10:00 1. Save - when 'oil' is high, when 'oil' is low.
2. Try not to overspend on recurrent expenditure.
3. Do not take debts for your kids to pay back (especially when you've already defaulted on 2.) @Gidimeister
2610 2018-05-22 19:09:57 I paid $90 for my truck in the oil and gas capital of HOUSTON! Just last year I could fill it up for less than $50.
2611 2018-05-22 19:09:42 Just In: The B.C. government has filed a statement of claim against Alberta's Court of Queen's Bench. The action comes after Alberta passed legislation that makes it possible to limit how much oil comes to B.C. More to come. #bcpoli
2612 2018-05-22 19:09:26 Yes must have right to try. My snake oil business will booming once we #maga  #$$$
2613 2018-05-22 19:09:19 And Bush you are going to stand trial and you Saudi Arabians we don't want your oil keep it it's useless
2614 2018-05-22 19:09:05 #SlashFuelPrice @narenndramodi @rajinikanth The cost of litre of oil being app Rs 36.00, the profit margin of oil companies both PUB & PRI is close to 100% including GST , the Centre must take immediate steps to control fuel prices ??
2615 2018-05-22 19:09:04 And can eat butter, cheese, cream, nuts, olive oil, full-fat everything.  So satisfying, after struggling to maintain high-carb, low-fat for decades!
2616 2018-05-22 19:08:53 You couldn't form Govt. After having 104 seats, what is this solution to fuel prices are you talking about?? Is Iran again willing to trade oil in INR?
2617 2018-05-22 19:08:43 all you need to short the hell outta #oil!!!
2618 2018-05-22 19:08:29 don't need pipelines don't use the oil in them @CanadianGreens @ElizabethMay #UseOil2 sell it at 80+$or #35$ do the math the oil is going to sold build schools and shelters or not your choice
2619 2018-05-22 19:08:22 I'm here for the tips too . I know castor oil helps too.
2620 2018-05-22 19:08:12 Till you have to put 3 litres of oil in it a week 
2621 2018-05-22 19:08:06 Do you think all this mess would have been avoided with a concerted plan to save all the oil money when there was a boom rather than sharing it up and down?
2622 2018-05-22 19:08:03 It’s mad ain’t it Dave? Had a hard time finishing top 4 at Man City with all that oil man, bought poorly, is old as hell yet some want him because he’s a “name”. This is why we don’t deserve nice things by thinking this way. I want a plan, not a name.
2623 2018-05-22 19:08:01 Of course oil revenues are rising so they can keep working on the weapon.
2624 2018-05-22 19:08:00 If it's less than $15 a barrel to extract, yet we're allegedly paying Oil Co's to do it, where are all the profits going exactly?

(Look to the BVI, I suspect...)
2625 2018-05-22 19:07:58 in the waiting room for my oil change and some guy legit picking his nose and he literally put his boogers ON THE WALL OF THE WAITING ROOM. Y’all, there’s ppl like this out there FR. How disgusting, GROWN man too! His wife got her shoes off too! Like it’s THEIR HOME!
2626 2018-05-22 19:07:51 What by bombing and killing them again. That worked out well for Libya the 1st time didn’t it......
Give them the money to rebuild what they had and the stolen revenues from their oil then I’m sure they will be part way there.
2627 2018-05-22 19:07:35 try bio oil! it really helped me
2628 2018-05-22 19:07:33 .@Dave_Eby detailing reasons for action after warning #Alberta this would happen. He says #Ottawa also rejected request to have Supreme Court of Canada resolve dispute over jurisdiction involving transport of oil through #BC. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #TransMountain #KinderMorgan
2629 2018-05-22 19:07:25 My job has a concierge service and they’re picking my car up tomorrow and taking it for an oil change. Should ask them to take it to the car wash too
2630 2018-05-22 19:07:23 Wait so now it's Canada's oil? I thought BC didn't want Alberta's dirty oil. If you want the benefits you have to accept the risks too BC. Let's stop dicking around accept it's going to flow and work together to ensure there are no spills. Hell pitch in for a local refinery.
2631 2018-05-22 19:06:52 So let's get this straight...Horgan and the NDP are suing to keep oil from coming in to BC from Kinder Morgan and they are suing to stop the Alberta NDP government from blocking oil from coming into BC. These guys are incredible.
2632 2018-05-22 19:06:45 For decades, New Mexico has safely produced oil and natural gas in the San Juan Basin while protecting cultural and historic treasures.

2639 2018-05-22 19:05:44 The baby oil trick does not work when it comes to removing stage tan
2640 2018-05-22 19:05:40 It aids Israel as it acknowledges, as our Congress did 20 year ago, Israel's right to their own land. It recognizes Jerusalem as their ancient and modern capital. It encourages others to stand against the anti-Israel forces and strengthens our alliance. And it has succeeded
2641 2018-05-22 19:05:38  I make my own lotions n potions. Mainly shea butter coconut oil, rosehip oil and then a ton of essential oils :)
2642 2018-05-22 19:05:27 You can try peppermint oil. Add it and some water to a spray bottle and spray away.
2643 2018-05-22 19:05:25 Daily Price Estimate - as at 22 May 2018:   Petrol UP 82 cents per litre, Diesel UP 85 cents at the pump in June (R/$ 12.78, Oil $79.22)
2644 2018-05-22 19:05:07 That should be 3 tablespoons of oil (rogue shift, there)
2645 2018-05-22 19:05:07 If you liked that then I’d recommend Deepwater Horizon if you haven’t seen it. Same director/Marky Mark combo retelling story of BP oil spill (not a spoiler)

2650 2018-05-22 19:04:34 Ah the infamous oil change worker coming in to talk to you with a clipboard of extra stuff they want to replace
2651 2018-05-22 19:04:06 The point is that some oil has to be moved and the choice of how it is moved matters. Pipelines are safer than the alternative and this project also comes with major marine safety improvements that make tanker traffic safer as well
2652 2018-05-22 19:03:38 Like oil rig oil?
2653 2018-05-22 19:03:32 note for self: airbrush is good for shading clothes, but not for skin.
base colors > oil brush to apply colors on new layer (taste the waters) > additional light and shades > rendering on merged layer
+ always duplicate layers before merging layers
2654 2018-05-22 19:03:31 Obviously you would prefer to get oil and gas from Eastern countries where women are mistreated even killed for the tiniest infraction. Constantly warring and untrustworthy.
2655 2018-05-22 19:03:19 Define "scarce." I don't know how old you are, but I was an adult in the 1970s.  Inflation in the UK hit 25%. It affected everything due to knock-on effect. Several reasons, eg oil price hikes, but also excessive wage demands from militant unions for the same output a key reason.
2656 2018-05-22 19:03:15 BJP spokesperson Narendra Taneja says duty raised when oil prices were low was to prevent pollution arising from irresponsible consumption of cheap petrol. BRILLIANT
2657 2018-05-22 19:03:15 @msnbc if you want to believe Trump’s writers have created a new form of art with the tweet misspellings, then I have an oil well to sell you. Trump is an uneducated buffoon posing as a human being. He is now and has always been an idiot!
2658 2018-05-22 19:02:50 I’m certain you’re not. 
I once found what I thought was a can of petrol in my boot.
Discovered it was engine oil after I’d poured it in.
2659 2018-05-22 19:02:31 I think a few reasons. A new refinery is 10-15 billion and no business would invest that in a less than welcoming environment like ours. Activists and oil sands haters would hijack it too. You still need a pipeline, same group, same reasons. 1/2
2660 2018-05-22 19:02:29 Okayyyyy still doesn't change the fact that crude oil is surging at a 3.5 year high
2661 2018-05-22 19:02:26 Why did it need doing now? We had an embassy in Tel Aviv where most other embassies are. We've aided Israel since that nation's founding. Moving our embassy to Jerusalem doesn't increase stability or move the parties closer to an agreement.
2662 2018-05-22 19:02:24 B.C. has filed a constitutional challenge of Alberta legislation Preserving Canada’s Economic Prosperity Act, Bill 12, that @RachelNotley has referenced to when she says she'll consider "turning off the oil taps" for B.C. Attorney General David Eby to speak soon @BlackPressMedia
2663 2018-05-22 19:02:13 If you ll compare the price of crude oil during upa 1 and 2 and modi govt then you will understand the loot
2664 2018-05-22 19:02:10 Did You Know? Each ton of recycled paper can save 380 gallons of oil.
2665 2018-05-22 19:02:09 This braai topic is also part of why making friends with cishets is like continuously spraying oil in your eyes. You leave your home to enjoy a braai, batho ba fihla ba go foka ka dijo and hlompho.
2666 2018-05-22 19:02:05 It's called foreign investment. Bet you shop at Lowes, Home Depot, Walmart, McDonalds, etc. Koch bros don't own everything in the oil sands.
2667 2018-05-22 19:02:04 It's Cuba 2.0 - Shitty government with oil
2668 2018-05-22 19:01:52 No doubt, Venezuela has many US spooks in residence intent on a coup.  No country is allowed by the US to nationalize its oil for the common good.

2672 2018-05-22 19:01:33 You do know global crude oil prices decreased like crazy during the last 4 years and are still below the 2013 level..

2679 2018-05-22 19:01:10 Get to know "Why Ugandan  oil and gas industry has failed to kick off and why it may not kick off in 2019 as speculated.! in the next of oil and gas journal.#MonitorUpdates #VisionUpdates #MEMD #PAU #UNOC #Total E&P
2680 2018-05-22 19:01:07 When will this be investigated? 
This too can't be swept under the rug. 
I'm getting so sick of this double standard 
Crap. "IMPEACH Trump, he told the Russians to release Hillary's emails on TV" "We got him now, it's the smoking gun" 

FBI spied on Trump "Nothing to see here"
2681 2018-05-22 19:01:06 Stop the blocade of venezuela US. It is about oil only. Disgraceful. Oil just hit new high. Only purpose and reasoning here, besides ending just socialist economies. Shame on you USA .

2683 2018-05-22 19:01:01 BUSINESS IS ABOUT TO BE GOOD FOR AMERICA AND ISRAEL IN THE TRILLIONS-EXPORT THAT OIL
2684 2018-05-22 19:00:50 Hedge Funds Keep Cutting Bets on Oil Rally as Oil Keeps Rallying
2685 2018-05-22 19:00:49 Only reason is oil, nothing else. I don't see the U.S involved in Zimbabwe, South Africa where white farmers are being killed, is that not terror?
2686 2018-05-22 19:00:41 Who owns the Oil, might be wrong question, isn’t what you get from it that matters? 

Look back The Great Contract aka Great Britain, People keep miss the point because your friend & theirs lawyers are a turn over & Barristers talk Gibberish, nice little earner @BarristerSecret
2687 2018-05-22 19:00:37 How is olive oil any better than other oils?

2691 2018-05-22 19:00:28 I agree, it all goes back to Jarrett 2008 via Milder 2010, and a shitty lard and corn oil lab diet and scientists who don't check their variables or understand what they're measuring. 

Deep dive done.

2697 2018-05-22 19:00:18 I agree but we will need oil and gas for a long time until we can all live from renewable energy.

2700 2018-05-22 19:00:06 Even a slight film of dirt can mar your car’s finish. Comprised of dirt, salt, oil, and pollutants, that film is abrasive, traps moisture, and causes microscopic scratches and pitting. Having the car professionally detailed minimizes scratches and protects against further damage.

2703 2018-05-22 18:59:49 I bet they would! An Indy Scotland would have an oil-based currency, the pound would free-fall in the markets without the oil reserves behind it.  Our own currency is the best option, have nothing to do with Westminster!
2704 2018-05-22 18:59:30 What kind of olive oil is that?
2705 2018-05-22 18:59:10 I Need Your Oil  @edeweysmith
2706 2018-05-22 18:59:07 Let fums send me my glow oil and my skin is my skin. Woh you people will beg me to stop posting pictures 
2707 2018-05-22 18:59:00 Thought we were heading for ME Oil FREE and doing our own drilling?
2708 2018-05-22 18:58:48 Have you ever noticed how thick some Middle Easterners hair is? They put a little Extra Virgin Olive oil into their palm, rub their hands together, and massage their scalp. Triple Milled soap for washing before.
2709 2018-05-22 18:58:48 How do you tell if the gear box oil is finished?
2710 2018-05-22 18:58:32 India imports Approx. 82%  crude oil thus steep fluctuation in its price is obvious so sincere effort to develope good public transport network is the most viable solution to reduce the consumption of petro fuel but instead govt. is minting money out of it.
2711 2018-05-22 18:58:31 Come on the Oil companies would never try to deliberately keep people on fossil fuels when better alternatives are available.... Oh wait, never mind.
2712 2018-05-22 18:58:18 When the internet tells you olive oil will help your rash, so you cover your legs in olive oil... strangest thing I’ve ever done tbh
2713 2018-05-22 18:58:17 We’re also pleased to have Dr. Ken Lee, National Senior Scientific Advisor for Oil Spill Research, Preparedness and Response @FishOceansCAN, join us for today's engagement session to share information on oil spill dispersants.
2714 2018-05-22 18:58:15 Do we now have enough detail and granularity in our data to change the fundamental atomic business unit for analytics in an oil and gas company from a well to a hydrocarbon molecule?
2715 2018-05-22 18:58:05 Short version: MCFC and PSG are backed by states guarantees (Oil), Milan are backed by a high interest loan of a shady billionaire
2716 2018-05-22 18:58:05 It's a little drying so olive oil saves it. Both are superb.
2717 2018-05-22 18:58:03 I predicted that our local gas would be $4.00 or more by 2020 if Trump was elected. Was $1.89 before election, now 2.99 9/10ths and less than two years in. When you have people invested in oil in office it takes a big jump up.
2718 2018-05-22 18:57:57 Plz mention international market crude oil price too and then generate stats.
2719 2018-05-22 18:57:55 Let's say Trump makes friends with North Korea, but what about Iran which had ground troops in Iraq and Syria to fight Isis. Seems like a slap and dumb to remake them into an enemy after a deal. Oil prices will rise

2723 2018-05-22 18:57:30 Attorney General @Dave_Eby about to detail response to #Alberta legislation giving that province power to limit oil transfers to #BC.  He's already threatened legal action against Bill 12 which hasn't been tested in court. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #TransMountain #KinderMorgan
2724 2018-05-22 18:57:21 War is a racket! And oil at us$8 too!!!

2726 2018-05-22 18:57:14 All because of ? Hmmmm Brexit. Ok mate. Nothing to do with austerity, world oil prices, inflation home and abroad etc etc np it hey if you want to believe that economic failure then feel free.

2740 2018-05-22 18:55:06 Pls send free olive oil for free advertising!!!!!!!
2741 2018-05-22 18:55:02 The USA has been moving tanker oil from Alaska down the Canadian coast for decades. Their Refineries then produce the gasoline for ignorant BC residents. It’s a perfect example of stupidity.
2742 2018-05-22 18:54:57 Someone pointed out the dood in question is not that old school and apparently involved in snake oil projects.
2743 2018-05-22 18:54:44 Perhaps you should first explain what you think a standard oil spill response woukd look like and then how that response would change if it were dilbit. What do you think the recovery rate for an American tanker spilling at Anacortes would look like? Then that same in a storm
2744 2018-05-22 18:54:41 Oh in case you were wondering, we managed to get the finger out of the kaleidoscope intact with only minor emotional trauma to the child. The kaleidoscope, sadly, did not come out of this well after being attacked by sharp objects and cooking oil #motherknowsbest #firstaidninja
2745 2018-05-22 18:54:31 You pulled out of the Iran deal so that the Presidents cronies in the oil industry (ie. Rex Tillerson, Vladimir Putin) could continue to drive up oil prices and enrich themselves. It’s always about the money.
2746 2018-05-22 18:54:31 It is time to remove @EPAScottPruitt. He is destructive of democracy & the environment. “Look! Somebody’s car leaked oil.”
“No, that just where Scott Pruitt was standing.”

2749 2018-05-22 18:54:04 @Angelin_Astrova you should open your own oil refinery
2750 2018-05-22 18:54:01 Pulling with coconut oil is the nastiest  ever. Ugh 
2751 2018-05-22 18:54:00 Dude sadak  manmohan Singh was importing crude oil from Iran for almost free he didn't pay any single penny to pay the import bills from iran. Why was he selling petrol/desel 70rs/ltr.
2752 2018-05-22 18:53:58 WHY IS MY LITTLE BROTHER TRYNA PUT OIL IN AN AIR FRYER DF???!!!!!!!!!!!??!!!???!?????!?!???!

2755 2018-05-22 18:53:49 Any treatment made with keratin, moroccan oil or argan oil. Hair masks would be a good recommendation as well. My school carried Redken, so maybe if you have an ulta near you or any other kind of beauty supply store you can find Redken supplies or anything you need there (:
2756 2018-05-22 18:53:37 Bhai saab Kab tak logon ko bewakoof banayenge app log. The promise was decrease oil prices under #BJP govt but unfortunately ur graph showed us increasing prices.

The Texas oil and natural gas industry provides $____ per day in revenue for state and local communities.
2759 2018-05-22 18:53:23 Simple. They’re both anti-environment, pro-big oil.
2760 2018-05-22 18:53:17 @Angelin_Astrova checking your oil nice
2761 2018-05-22 18:52:59 Get your oil changed

2763 2018-05-22 18:52:57 I love garlic, but this garlic oil is so strong.
2764 2018-05-22 18:52:56 So much for high oil price creating more projects/jobs
2765 2018-05-22 18:52:22 Alain, Alain... "things are really as bad as they seem" :) Ansioux with avoidant is oil with water :) Only a secure type can, with luck, give some trust to the ansioux type and some space to the avoidant type.
2766 2018-05-22 18:52:21 It's a commodity export economy under massive sanctions his policies brought upon his own people. Low oil prices don't help.  But all I see is an "us against the world" dug in spirit from the majority of Russians. /1
2767 2018-05-22 18:52:18 But it’s ok for Canada to buy their oil!!???
2768 2018-05-22 18:52:15 That’s a stretch.

Given we are not claiming your opinion is lacking virtue - in this latest subject.

I’ll agree we all do it to some level but it goes to extremes in some cases where it’s blatantly obvious virtue signaling.
2769 2018-05-22 18:52:05 I understand the need for overlap but to speed the growth of renewable energy more focus and investment is needed. Falling back to oil only benefits short term players. Think global not local. Be a shining example not a flickering candle
2770 2018-05-22 18:52:04 When $cl_f is red and oil stocks just goes blah....
2771 2018-05-22 18:51:54 I've got lemon water, gluten free lemon drizzle cake & my feet are soaking in lemon & lavender essential oil. Can I join in? #greenwichhour
2772 2018-05-22 18:51:48 for the ants
You can use essential oils such as peppermint, citrus oil & tea tree oil to make an ant-repellent spray. Purchase a clean spray bottle & fill it with 1/4 cup of water, 15 drops of tea tree oil, 15 drops of peppermint oil & seven drops of the citrus oil of your choice
2773 2018-05-22 18:51:44 #ableg #bcpoli There is already an existing pipeline on the right of way. Alberta is now being forced to sell oil at a discount to the US, loosing compared to world market. Even @RachelNotley a woman! Says expanding the existing right of way makes sense. At least listen to her!

2783 2018-05-22 18:51:00 @realDonaldTrump - Dear Mr. President: gas prices at the pump have gone crazy. Maybe you can help me understand. We are exporting energy, oil, yet we’re importing foreign oil. I thought if we had our own we took care of the home folks first, yet prices go up 20, 30 cents

2792 2018-05-22 18:49:46 India is not an oil producing nation and high oil price impact Indians

Govt charges exorbitant fuel tax that is used to pay inflated salaries of few govt employees and babus

Let private companies sell oil based on cost and reasonable profit margins as in European nations
2793 2018-05-22 18:49:40 Iceland are good - they are cutting products with Palm oil too - leading the way - good on them!
2794 2018-05-22 18:49:31 Wake up. Trump is telling these morons what to say. If they deviate ,  he fires them. Putin needs sanctions lifted to keep power due to the low price of oil. Hillary would ask for Crimea and democracy.   Trump just wants a tower in Russia with his name on it. Simple, get it?

2813 2018-05-22 18:46:58 2/ OPEC oil shocks of 1970s began fundamental reorganization of global manufacturing. US mgmt was too slow to adapt, lost market share to imports.  Management failed to set aside reserves for obligations to pensions. Management cut costs by cutting quality.
2814 2018-05-22 18:46:57 Oil isn't a fiscal problem. Very few subsidies. It basically feeds straight into inflation which means it is a problem for CBRT
2815 2018-05-22 18:46:34 A simplistic argument that ignores the fact that oil not transported by pipeline will have to move by less safe means like rail. Current demand being met with Alaskan crude will have to come from somewhere else.

2 for $69 usd or 1 for $39 usd :D
2942 2018-05-22 18:34:05 So you think Obama would have ignored him if he came to the table? Do you think Iran deserved the same recognition? Or the exception in their case was oil and their hate for Israel. The hate Obama shared.
2943 2018-05-22 18:33:56 at that point forego the crunchy veggie-dressing-cake and go for some slices of tomato and mozarella and dress it with oil and balsamic.

2945 2018-05-22 18:33:46 I used sugar, coconut oil, and peppermint extract for scent. Look on Pinterest tho and it’ll tell you exactly what to do.
2946 2018-05-22 18:33:37 Red currant jelly is amazing on meat! But Chili oil is great on curry... Hmm which one is the best..?
2947 2018-05-22 18:33:19 Maybe you should read about China’s recession or about their dependency on foreign oil and current oil prices. China is not in a position of leverage now and thank God Trump is savvy enough to know. Unfortunately, people like you get to benefit while they complain.
2948 2018-05-22 18:33:19 Oil prices should be....

2952 2018-05-22 18:32:57 I really like this for oil control. But I believe their everyday moisturizer + spf gets good marks, too, though I haven't tried it.
2953 2018-05-22 18:32:49 Gas prices up again today.  Trump is the great negotiator. Working for Big Oil and NRA donations. Do Trumpers still believe they won anything with GOPTAXSCAM. Republicans are owned by wealthy Big Oil donors. Gas up 1.50 since GOPTAXSCAM was rammed through by Republicans
2954 2018-05-22 18:32:48 Back to stone age? Well U just said it, it is just a dream. Everyone know it is impossible if we are not going to start manhunting worldwide. Maybe U have some ideas to make things happen cleaner? Like using wood instead of oil or something like that.
2955 2018-05-22 18:32:37 I think that’s true of a lot of industries. I have my doubts on this one, but clearly things like oil try to fend off agw as well. Oil and agw continue to co-exist in conflict, and that’s motivated by placing economics over public interest one way or the other.
2956 2018-05-22 18:32:28 Oh. That already took effect, and was then summarily routed to the Russians via higher oil prices, caused by the US violating the JCAOP, in order to pay off Trump’s debts. But hey! MAGA baby!!
2957 2018-05-22 18:32:09 nah yall think im playing.. when i get home Im gonna show u this other shit i ordered and compare it for you... i use that shit as a scalp oil as to not waste my money
2958 2018-05-22 18:32:07 Well it not a surprise, after all the government allow the oil companies to walk over us paying a minimum amount in taxes. Sweden does it right.

2970 2018-05-22 18:31:15 Buhari should stop claiming that crude oil prices averaged $100 per bbl from 99- 2015. It’s something that anybody can google and find out. Prices rose from $25 in 1999 and reached $100 in 2007 then dipped to $50 in 2008. Probably averaged $100 btwn 2009 and 2014.
2971 2018-05-22 18:31:14 Great minds think alike 
2972 2018-05-22 18:31:12 I must admit, I identify with Vogler’s feelings here.  Having served there, I dismissed the notions of an oil agenda and believed the effort to be a noble cause.  I was in my mid twenties and perhaps a bit naive.  Throw-stuff-angry.  Excellent description... cc:@LFredenhall
2973 2018-05-22 18:31:08 @Chasing @jimmienoman Buy, accumulate and hold. The new company with be worth a lot more.. OIL on the way to $100
2974 2018-05-22 18:31:00 Pretty interesting. It is only a matter of time until we see this type of oil become mroe widely avilable to the public!

3013 2018-05-22 18:27:30 The Real Deal > Iran's plan is to sell oil to Europe priced in Euros, not petro-dollars. Obama & Kerry knew it - it's why EU doesn't support DJT decision to back out of Fictitious Iran Nuke Deal. @POTUS is America First.
3014 2018-05-22 18:27:28 Take 3 tsp of coconut oil and half squeezed lemon juice. Apply this mixture all over the body and massage gently especially on elbows, neck and dark area. It removes darkness, sun tan and enhance your #skin tone by moisturizing too. Leave the oil for 10 mints before taking shower
3015 2018-05-22 18:27:11 Don't forget when he pulled out of the Iran deal raising oil prices and directly benefiting Russia and Saudi Arabia.

To keep your prostate healthy, eat 1 -2 tablespoons of uncooked olive oil daily.

3039 2018-05-22 18:25:44 Dropped some in the last few weeks here. So now $3.79 today at the station near me. CA gas prices don't always follow the nation as we produce our own, being #3 in the nation on oil production, but the refiners have clever ways to limit supply and cause havoc in prices.

3044 2018-05-22 18:25:23 You fill it up with water to the line and then put 4 drops plus of minus of an essential oil or 2. Turn it on and it will mist into the air. The nice part is being able to pick and mix the oils giving more natural options for smells. Not limited to the smells in the store.

3072 2018-05-22 18:22:43 It's more like CRIMINAL...but you do you. Hope all the accusations stick to #ScottPruitt like an oil spill on a sea otter.
3073 2018-05-22 18:21:58 Your favorite essential oil? Go...
3074 2018-05-22 18:21:50 WHY IS GAS SO MUCH HIGHER UNDER TRUMP THAN OBAMA?
Because Obama won his election himself & didn't owe Putin or anyone a thing. Not so with Putin's delivery boy, Trump: Putin wants high oil? Trump will deliver. He has to, otherwise Putin will leak treason evidence. Just ask Don Jr
3075 2018-05-22 18:21:33 Not if you eat beso afterwards. It's suck all the butter or oil lol
3076 2018-05-22 18:21:26 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
3077 2018-05-22 18:21:24 Which is better looking?
3078 2018-05-22 18:21:21 Did you know that inhaling an essential oil has a definite and dramatic effect on your aura?

3082 2018-05-22 18:20:55 The US being a minion of Israel and does not want good to the citizens of Iran, they do not care about them, the main thing to take over oil and gas of Iran.
3083 2018-05-22 18:20:54 I need Castro oil but I don’t know where to buy it
3084 2018-05-22 18:20:51 This will happen again if oil rises back to those level.  No political party will risk letting the price go beyond a certain point.  Since there was a higher price point in past, it has been easier to manage the population.
3085 2018-05-22 18:20:46 I have been reworking another piece this last week; slapping on the vibrant colours and adding some impasto texture to the flower. I am loving this style. What do you think?

3086 2018-05-22 18:20:43 The chart on the left doesn’t even include oil!
3087 2018-05-22 18:20:39 Ha! GMTA.....
3088 2018-05-22 18:20:26 I love La Croix, but I’ve gotta be honest... the coconut flavor tastes like someone spilled tanning oil in a water cup.
3089 2018-05-22 18:20:24 So, basically the typical blubbering this snake oil salesman has always used to con people even more ignorant than himself. God, what a fake
3090 2018-05-22 18:20:20 all pure rose water mists are excellent for throughout the day and any other cleansers that use rose water as an ingredient are usually nice too. just don’t use any harsh scrubs and make sure the products you’re using are oil free (combo skin needs moisture but not oil induced)
3091 2018-05-22 18:20:17 I'm certain I'd have less junk mail if you sold my data to Russian hackers, Nigerian oil ministers and a Thai dating agency than I'm currently experiencing because of everyone updating permissions to comply with GDPR. I wonder how much it is costing everyone in lost time. #GDPR
3092 2018-05-22 18:20:17 At a strip club, Reince Preibus carefully explains to Betsy DeVos that Satanists are drilling for oil. A local TV anchor warms up the audience.
3093 2018-05-22 18:20:12 Not everything made on foreign soil is good as far as oil absorbent pads and rolls go. It’s best and safest to choose US made, high quality #spill control products. Hurry and reserve yours now! (860) 350-2200
3094 2018-05-22 18:20:08 Cough "oil" cough
3095 2018-05-22 18:20:06 All that oil
3096 2018-05-22 18:19:52 If Cory wasn’t there to remind me that my oil needs changed and that I have less than half a tank of gas with about $0.28 to my name, I’d be on my way lolol
3097 2018-05-22 18:19:47 ICE deportations and separating families, selling our national parks for oil drilling, deregulation of water and air protection, bailing on the Paris Accord, breaking our agreement in Iran, I really could go on. Yes, these all affected me. This is my country, my people so I care
3098 2018-05-22 18:19:47 I've seen brief, 4-5 minute clips on the internet that start out like this
3099 2018-05-22 18:19:47 If it’s domestic oil, get the price back down!!!!!
3100 2018-05-22 18:19:42 Seriously? This is heights! What is the base of your inflation calculation? Do even understand anything about global oil prices,$ vs rupee rate, taxation on fuel or for that matter how economy works?
3101 2018-05-22 18:19:29 I’ve been using coconut oil on my eyebrows before bed for maybe 2 months now and wow. THE GROWTH IS SERIOUS.
3102 2018-05-22 18:19:27 Murphy Oil – SCOTUS has spoken.

T-ball will meet next week on Tuesday, May 29.
3108 2018-05-22 18:18:49 @PetroleumMin The Excise Duty on Petroleum should be reduced from 52% to 28% to bring relief to the people. After all, the Govt has collected enough of taxes when International Crude Oil prices were low. It will be a game changer.
3109 2018-05-22 18:18:41 Checked my dipstick last week and my oil was low so I spent £20 on new oil today, go to put it in the car but decided to check again first to see how low it was ( &to judge the amount to put in) and miraculously my oil level has risen. (Same flat surface used) wasted £20. 
3110 2018-05-22 18:18:31 should be "Oil" in that board
3111 2018-05-22 18:18:28 The US being a minion of Israel and does not want good to the citizens of Iran, they do not care about them, the main thing to take over oil and gas of Iran. You a traitor?
3112 2018-05-22 18:18:24 Strong, qualified leadership is absolutely vital to fulfilling the EPA’s mission. It’s troubling that the Trump administration chose a former oil industry spokesman who has defended oil spills and questioned climate change to lead the work here as the Region 9 administrator.
3113 2018-05-22 18:18:18 Thanks! Yes, I'ave actually tried all of these. Caffeine is a big trigger for me. Melatonin and meditation often help, but not always. Finally, a combo of melatonin, CBD oil, meditation and ASMR did the trick last night!
3114 2018-05-22 18:18:09 WHATS UP!!!!!!! i just got back from my oil painting class and it was so fun!!!
3115 2018-05-22 18:18:08 Calling humus chickpea butter is inaccurate it’s much more like mashed chickpeas where seasame butter is one of the ingredients, along with lemon, olive oil, maybe sumac, etc. I can’t believe I’m using this analogy

3117 2018-05-22 18:17:51 Nae luck buddy. Fingers crossed you get sorted.
3118 2018-05-22 18:17:48 Hey but trump benefits from that Rosneft oil deal that russia sold to the Qataris.  Just as it closed, he left the Iran deal to inflate gas prices.  Is Tillerson back at ExxonMobil  to reap the rewards of his time in office?
3119 2018-05-22 18:17:47 It's just reflective of the flavour of the chocolate - peppermint oil for the mint, orange oil for the orange etc. Trace allergens would have to be declared. (eg sesame oil would have to be 'natural oil (sesame)' or some such.
3120 2018-05-22 18:17:45 Just like Libya, Iraq where UN & US forces went to discover WMD and found nothing but end it up by invading  the whole region.

3126 2018-05-22 18:17:29 As opposed to Wall Street/Investment bankers who DO know everything. Same with oil/energy tycoons They both know everything, but, unfortunately, their personal goals cloud their public stances. Should they forfeit their citizenship, as you propose show business personnel do?
3127 2018-05-22 18:17:26 I recently started watchig it and am now at part 10/11.
No one told me that their coach would cut the fucking brake oil though.
3128 2018-05-22 18:17:23 Do that too. Don't try to create18 new states just because oil is $100.
3129 2018-05-22 18:17:22 If everyone took 5 gm. of vitamin C, 2 gm. of fish oil, 3000 I.U. of Vitamin D and a high quality multi-vitamin every day you would have a healthier population and a smaller deficit. This would not excuse Trump but a healthy electorate wouldn't have elected him. I am only 91.

3133 2018-05-22 18:16:58 To quote our Premier, there’s not a school, hospital, or highway in  that Alberta oil revenues and taxes didn’t contribute to. (AB pays $5500 per person per year into transfer payments alone, mostly generated by oil & gas.)
3134 2018-05-22 18:16:45 Wow I fully endorse the use of coconut oil for eyebrow thickening and growth.
3135 2018-05-22 18:16:43 So it's a use at your own risk kind of thing. Just like I wouldn't use a heavy moisturizer, I wouldn't expect someone with dry skin to use anything with baking soda on their skin. And to those that do use it, make sure to use a good face oil and moisturizer for your skin after 
3136 2018-05-22 18:16:39 My boobs don’t sweat but my face does and I look like an oil slick 24/7
3137 2018-05-22 18:16:33 The conclusion from your own citation: 
“Attention is now switching to extracting the remaining accessible reserves cost effectively and looking at opportunities to diversify into new technologies and sectors.” As I said, theres no future in Scotland’s oil industry.
3138 2018-05-22 18:16:14 he walks around in his yard and strikes oil. Oil Baron Hulk.
3139 2018-05-22 18:16:07 Typical of a man to attempt to put words into a womens mouth...gross. Point out where I said I support oil from terror states. Newsflash you fear mongerer, ethical Alberta gas is already getting to market. When did  United States get elevated to a terror state? Facts matter goof
3140 2018-05-22 18:15:59 Hey awesome man.

Hopefully the Taxes will he more than the price of an entire petrol pump by 2020.

Absolute ache din, where everyone will buy a petrol pump and buy crude oil directly and refine it. 

Bharat Mata Ki Jai! @narendramodi
3141 2018-05-22 18:15:58 It is despicable to behave as you do and yet have accepted the position as the caretaker of our environmental watchdog agency. If you are pro pollution (coal, oil etc) you should be honest about it rather than what you are doing.

3148 2018-05-22 18:15:15 I agree with you about eletrification, OIL, and I know TESLA doesn't produce hybrids. I just don't see it and its valuation as market does. It's prettty clear TESLA is just another carmaker and not "THE CARMAKER" as if it had made a revolution in the industry, an IPHONE. Bubble!!
3149 2018-05-22 18:15:13 The Chinese are starting up a new coal fired plant every 3 days. World oil consumption is now 100,000,000 bbl/d. Any one who studied physics and thermodynamics understands that only nuclear and fossil fuels can support 7 billion humans. Renewable is a myth.

3155 2018-05-22 18:14:47 I think you haven't heard of crude oil prices in international market of 2013 and 2018.

That is the problem with Andhbhakts they don't use brain just copy and paste 
3156 2018-05-22 18:14:39 Compare exchange rate btw 2013 and 2016 u will understand the differentials. And don't say PMB made the exchange rate to spike, it was drop in oil price, recession and a depleted foreign reserve.
3157 2018-05-22 18:14:33 I’d like to see how you get by without using oil.  Seriously
3158 2018-05-22 18:14:24 tergantung dalem atau ngga, coba pake bio oil? aku udah lumayan ilang
3159 2018-05-22 18:14:03 Hola @mariannaparraga por favor si me puedes compartir al privado tu e-mail para enviarte una información de interés del sector oil and gas
3160 2018-05-22 18:14:03 Actually, this probably more likely to happen in countries that don't want to sell their oil for $, petroyuan anyone? Libya wanted to sell in Africa dinar.  Whatever happened there?
3161 2018-05-22 18:13:55 America has wanted their oil for decades.
3162 2018-05-22 18:13:54 The oil companies and governments are fleecing the middle class people in the country by increasing the oil prices day in and day out.
3163 2018-05-22 18:13:47 All I've ever done with the 4x4 system on ours is to change the transfer case oil & differential oils. They're a ridiculously overbuilt mechanical system with some electric solenoids to switch transfer case modes. Hard to kill.
3164 2018-05-22 18:13:44 Those Fw190A pilots had to have a very sharp eye to spot the difference between the easy (relatively) pickings and the 'oh shit' ..3 or 4 blade prop and under wing oil cooler or radiator bath?

3166 2018-05-22 18:13:28 'a bonus for the Kremlin. The U.S. president’s Iran action means that Vladimir Putin could make up with the soaring price of oil – the real backbone of the Russian economy and his hold on power – for what he lost from the sanctions' @ReutersInsider

3172 2018-05-22 18:13:03 Question is not how much oil is there, as there is a lot. Question is how much accessible oil is there left in terms of technical & economic viability. Answer is nothing much.

3175 2018-05-22 18:12:34 Venezuela sits on top of great mineral wealth ( oil ). US presidents go ballistic when they cannot control that asset. The U.S. tried to take down the last president of Venezuela and failed. Iran & Venezuela have similar problems: Donald J Trump. 
3176 2018-05-22 18:12:30 Personally I dont know about that number, but while the pipeline wont create direct jobs once up and running cause mostly automated, the revenues it will generate by giving Alberta oil access to markets abroad are huge.
3177 2018-05-22 18:12:29 no oil drums? really?
3178 2018-05-22 18:12:19 It's a sector rotation trade. Higher oil, higher gas, lower consumer discret spend. So this would correct
3179 2018-05-22 18:12:18 Ok, I see. It's not a huge deal, IMO, but I definitely get the frustration. Good luck

3184 2018-05-22 18:11:09 The Globalist control the CIA and Brennan and Obama are caught and hopefully Trump takes them down as the Syrian War was only about an oil pipeline.

3187 2018-05-22 18:10:57 Have you had a proper look at the new Arsenal manager and thought that on a Loki, he looks like Low-key? Similar build and also a beardless man with lots of groundnut oil in his hair. How long until he goes for Morata
3188 2018-05-22 18:10:53 The need for Scottish diversity in the economy was/is and will continue to be ignored by the SNP. Salmonds 'it's ooor oil' has become a standing joke after ignoring everything else
3189 2018-05-22 18:10:45 Another time. Again, it’s not solely tankers that carry Iranian oil. It’s tankers whose owner is officially registered in Iran. Iran has a bunch of Shell companies offshore as well; many flags of convenience.

3191 2018-05-22 18:10:41 The EPA reportedly blocked CNN and Associated Press from attending Scott Pruitt's speech today. They also barred anyone who arrived in a Prius, anyone who could prove the earth was not flat, and anyone who forgot to bring their admission fee of 3lbs of coal or crude oil.
3192 2018-05-22 18:10:32 Another issue of populism is that it generally requires a demagogue & cult if personaliyy, not a good, long-term solution. Look at Venezuela. Everyone was happy until the oil ran out.
3193 2018-05-22 18:10:28 I know, I know RSS is responsible for the Global oil price hike

3195 2018-05-22 18:10:13 That’s the thing. @RachelNotley has done more for environmental policy and climate change measures in #Alberta than anyone before. She gets huge stick for it. But she is also realistic. She is diversifying alberta’s economy. But we still need that pipeline to get oil to the sea.

3199 2018-05-22 18:09:47 The message IS clear.  The U.S. will enforce Petro-Dollar use.  Iran was changing from trading oil using dollars to trading oil in Euros.
3200 2018-05-22 18:09:42 Ya-ya, know Govt will have to reduce prices as it will be elections soon and at present rate they will suffer in elections. I guess then bhakts will not worry about fiscal deficit and loss to oil companies.

3205 2018-05-22 18:09:30 BC Attorney General @Dave_Eby  to discuss province's next legal steps, following Alberta's passing of Bill 12 (Preserving Canada's Economic Prosperity Act) that gives AB power to turn off oil taps to BC. Last week Eby said BC would take AB to court #abpoli #bcpoli #cdnpoli
3206 2018-05-22 18:09:17 Modi govt supporting OIL MAFIYA  that's reason petrol desile prices are hiking and modi ji responsible for this
3207 2018-05-22 18:09:08 The truth is there was NEVER control over oil companies. It's all been propaganda to appease the masses.
3208 2018-05-22 18:09:06 Also ‘02. Pretty glad I didn’t join the army to pay for college. Yay student loans?

3218 2018-05-22 18:08:19 I think a guy who made his billion in the oil industry would know a few things about pipelines and the economy in general. Being rich doesn’t make you smart as you can win, or inherit money but you don’t make a billion being dumb.
3219 2018-05-22 18:08:19 Except Trump is trying to kill emissions standards and renewable incentives (e.g. energy star) that will increase demand for oil, therefore raise the price. Rs take a lot of $ from oil companies to do EXACTLY THIS. So it's pretty not stupid to do it Trump and Republicans.
3220 2018-05-22 18:08:17 So now dirty oil is Canadas'  life blood?   What a disgrace @RachelNotley
3221 2018-05-22 18:08:07 I love too Douse my fingers and toes w Cuticle Oil after a Shower 
3222 2018-05-22 18:08:04 Wish I'd thought of that! My Grandmother believed Cod Liver Oil cured everything from a cold to sunburn (and any other random childhood illness). That's how Mark  Zuckerberg feels about AI #AIistheanswer

3224 2018-05-22 18:07:53 They are protesting to protect the Pacific Coast from increasing oil pollution, so that they can continue to enjoy and paddle in a pristine coastal environment. What vehicle they use is irrelevant.
3225 2018-05-22 18:07:48 Yes, I think lots of people agree the future isnt in fossil fuel. Except energetic transition doesnt happen overnight, and as long as there’s oil being extracted here, we need to be able to sell it.
3226 2018-05-22 18:07:42 This amazing!! I am from Sudan-Africa where Sesame oil is been used for decades by our grandmothers to make a home made body and hair cream, and yes they have younger looking skin.
3227 2018-05-22 18:07:41 Irony... The biggest subsidy junkie in history was the UK, as it drained the wealth of the empire (mostly India). we've only kept our broken institutions running with North Sea oil for the last 50 years.  Brexit will solve all problems, I'm sure... ;-)
3228 2018-05-22 18:07:36 The oil industry is not about to take all my money 
3229 2018-05-22 18:07:32 Sir i m a hindu but can,t close my eyes... If ceude oil in International market is high then i ll not complaint...but  if govt.  Use our money for their advertisment and cant do anything for increased petrol prices then its our duty to question govt.
3230 2018-05-22 18:07:21 In practical terms, this is an oil embargo
3231 2018-05-22 18:07:18 @Gladwell did a piece on this not too long ago but it was McD's ... they changed from fat to oil, if I recall.
3232 2018-05-22 18:07:16 Looks like BJP is sure of defeat in 2019 and making as much money for oil companies as possible
3233 2018-05-22 18:07:12 As soon as oil comes under GST,

Farmers can start demanding INPUT credit.

farmer paid tax on, but didn't get input credit.. when he sold his product.

But if a bussiness man make a machine and paid taxes on raw material,

He will get same tax in return when his machinery sold
3234 2018-05-22 18:07:10 I like Evan McMullen. He’s definitely middle of the road even tho I think he’s Mormon. 

That assertion comes from him being from Utah, and is much like my assertion that babies in TX are issued guns at birth. Neithereither says they ride horses and all own oil fields too.

3235 2018-05-22 18:07:10 Ok but some slip through the cracks, my daughter is a Sheriff’s Deputy and on 302 in Tx so many truckers are either doing something stupid or are impaired. Tragic accidents happen. She has to deal with one she says at least a day but that area is extremely busy with oil industry.
3236 2018-05-22 18:07:06 For sure, but you don't look like you need to lose 20 in that picture.
3237 2018-05-22 18:07:05 Coconut oil also rly works well
3238 2018-05-22 18:06:55 Gotta make sure you dilute it with almond oil or something
3239 2018-05-22 18:06:51 My natural lashes has grown so long  just from putting coconut oil every night

3246 2018-05-22 18:06:28 For a fresh glowing face, mix Vit E oil and potato juice, use it on your face at night and wash it off the next day. thank me later 
3247 2018-05-22 18:06:24 RT @Best_LPT: When buying a used car, start it and rev the engine while you have a friend watch the exhaust. if the exhaust has a blue tint to it, it means the engine is burning oil and you should immediately walk away. #LifeProTips
3248 2018-05-22 18:06:16 Would you build a multi-billion dollar coal power plant right before coal gets phased out? Would you put all other issues aside to focus on building that coal plant that'll work for a couple years before shutting down.. Sustainable energy is the future. Not oil.
3249 2018-05-22 18:06:04 .Yeah, oil back in the news. Elite parasites' military, US military, is managing the "protection" of Syria's oil fields FOR THE THIEVES, ROTHSCHILD'S GENIE OIL & GAS. US mil has had the Kurds "protect" bt they r sick of it, so now ISIS will "protect" the theft of SYRIAN PPL'S OIL
3250 2018-05-22 18:06:04 Getting an oil change and watching “General Hospital.” What does it have anything to do with a hospital? I saw people pointing guns at each other. That has to violate at least some standardized medical practices.
3251 2018-05-22 18:06:04 Why cant the centre take the lead and call a meeting of the states to arrive at some consensus? Oil prices affect the prices of all the commodities throughout the country and the states can not make major changes individually, in isolation. And, this is vox-populi.
3252 2018-05-22 18:05:57 Yea the carnival one is oil actually... this one is mud

3255 2018-05-22 18:05:23 The issue is bigger than energy independence.  The US must control the energy resources of the world and force the world to buy gas and oil using dollars (fiat paper money).  It's about defending the Petro-dollar.  Explains our crazy alliance with SA.  Money-masters are in charge

3263 2018-05-22 18:04:32 The cuts are coming from the GOP, and the Wealthy are going to benefit just as right now. The tax cuts are benefitting the wealthy.  Just look at Gas, the extra in your paycheck is now going to oil companies. How is that a tax break?
3264 2018-05-22 18:04:31 Lest we forget, cooking oil is still unavailable and its byproducts (like margarine) are even scarcer.
3265 2018-05-22 18:04:28 I firmly believe that @Oil_Guns_Merica and I should procreate....strictly for the betterment of the human race, mind you....#Selfless
3266 2018-05-22 18:04:16 Put the corrupt in jail and then fix our Energy needs.   Imagine America running on the Sun, Wind and Waves.    Electric vehicles and a safe environment that can handle the manufacturing as opposed to Oil!
3267 2018-05-22 18:04:16 $500? Yikes. Yeah, all sounded a little off to me: totally incongruous with TLF’s tone. Did you hear him on Wade Keller last Thursday? Snake oil schtick to the nth degree. I find Keller remote and robotic at the best of times, but the pandering from him was simply nauseating.
3268 2018-05-22 18:04:03 My coworker said she doesn’t eat anything with oil and I was like oh swag you got a lot of self control and she turns around and tells me her life’s shit so she likes to be in control of one thing and now I’m crying because same.
3269 2018-05-22 18:03:57 Drumpf is once again showing his incompetence, another bottle of snake oil is emptied, commemorated by a challenge coin. How long will GOP return to its vomit?

3271 2018-05-22 18:03:26 Did anyone invest in Oil when it hit low $20s/barrel a few years ago?
3272 2018-05-22 18:03:18 #PEI has started toput taxation for electric heating on equal footing with furnace oil. But it's not there yet. Oil fully exempt from provincial portion of #HST.

3274 2018-05-22 18:03:01 Agreed, sous vide/ reverse sear being optimal. Searing with butter as opposed to a higher smoke point oil creates  good browning.

3276 2018-05-22 18:02:55 Biore charcoal cleansers, Mario Badescu enzyme cleansing gel. Tea tree oil is great you can try The Body Shop’s tea tree line or get a toner with it in it

3282 2018-05-22 18:02:25 but surely you can draw a direct link between Trump's actions and rising oil prices: threatening Iran sanctions and stoking wider Middle East instability?
3283 2018-05-22 18:02:00 Why did you left country without paying bills of 6.7bn dollar to Iran,kept all oil companies are in bankruptcy state

3285 2018-05-22 18:01:53 @narendramodi ji @dpradhanbjp i just have 1 suggestion. Kindly pitch Indian Rupee & sign a deal wherein payment for oil can be made in Indian currency instead of USD or Euro. This will be a small start towards strengthening Indian rupee in d international market.

3288 2018-05-22 18:01:49 If getting oil to market is this critical ( and I believe it is ) why was there not more protest from @RatchelNotley when #EnergyEast was scuttled by Trudeau ?  We desperately need both pipelines . If we are one Canada why is Eastern Canada treated so differently ?
3289 2018-05-22 18:01:48 walked in this guys bathroom that I just met, saw a big tub of coconut oil on the counter and knew I had found a safe place
3290 2018-05-22 18:01:45 No! From reading your comments I think you know exactly what you’re talking about. I was just trying to get the nuance. Oil is my favourite market and it does seem elevated up here

3296 2018-05-22 18:01:34 I'm sure Russia is quite appreciative in Trump's plan to sanction Iranian oil sales - prices are already jumping up. Saudis appreciate it too, and American consumers will again pay the price
3297 2018-05-22 18:01:23 I need to get my nails & toes done before the weekend , & i need to get an oil change
3298 2018-05-22 18:01:22 “Yes ma’am I was calling to see if I could schedule an oil change for some oil.” 

Oh really, I thought we exchanged Freon for oil changes. Whew!!
3299 2018-05-22 18:01:17 Reviewing the oil prices on a daily basis is itself a foolish decision. I think no where in the world this formula is followed. Oil companies keep stocks for more than a months of oil consumption in India. Then where is the necessity to review prices on a daily basis.
3300 2018-05-22 18:01:08 North Sea oil and gas for a start, Bank of England reserves, anything that belongs the UK government, to put it simply. You seem to be implying we won’t get anything. Why is that?

3313 2018-05-22 18:00:23 Price of oil goes up and our oil companies can afford to produce again. Which means many, many jobs - cash staying in the US - and stopping mass supporting of terrorists through the major oil producing countries.

3324 2018-05-22 17:59:43 @PMOIndia why gov not taking any action on fuel prices. Please bring oil under GST or remove all taxes including central and state. We have full trust on BJP. Please do something urgently
3325 2018-05-22 17:59:42 That’s funny.  Thought the dems wanted less oil usage and flaring for renewables.
3326 2018-05-22 17:59:40 for me, and i assume with many others, the hardest part was dairy. now i blend avocados with some oil, water, cilantro/coriander, jalapeño and a tiny bit of sugar to make a creamy sauce that i have used when i want something creamy in my meal. also works well as a pasta sauce
3327 2018-05-22 17:59:37 It's a sad indictment of UK Govs over the years that Norway's revenue per barrel of oil extracted since 1975 is three times as much as the UK's.

Hemp is the strongest, olive is a good medium ozone strength, olive/castor has lower ozone than olive but
3334 2018-05-22 17:59:02 Just to be clear, the US didn't sanction the oil, only the debt.  Not to say both weren't in a death spiral regardless
3335 2018-05-22 17:58:39 @PMOIndia sir plz think about drastically increasing the price of petrol and desil i hampers middle class and lower middle-class familly .I know the price of cloud oil is high this time .......... plz think about it ......cause some people r compair with u the previous paritis
3336 2018-05-22 17:58:36 Then fuck 'em. They have oil, and they need freedom.
3337 2018-05-22 17:58:31 Big Oil’s way of reducing the number of Black Bear that may interfere with extracting oil in North Alaska. 
3338 2018-05-22 17:58:16 They have 4th largest oil reserves and there starving. Maybe US should let them refine there oil and sell it. Think there’s gold to. 
3339 2018-05-22 17:58:08 Yeah it feels like there has been a lot of hyped goalies that have not lived up to expectations even amongst NHL goalies, let alone juniors. Still, there is something magical about 50+ save performances in big games that feels next-level.

3344 2018-05-22 17:57:29 @narendramodi sir oil prices per dhyan do aur sare tax hatao central plus state, otherwise agli baar koi nyi sarkar aa jayegi.
3345 2018-05-22 17:57:23 The Factors driving Oil prices higher:
1. OPEC seriously controlling supply
2. Iran Sanctions
3. Dramatic drop in Oil Production in Venezuela
4. Rampant speculation is back in Oil
3346 2018-05-22 17:57:23 seems a bit daft for @elonmusk to met with that autocrate, since tesla/@elonmusk want to rid our dependence on oil/fossil fuel , the only thing #MBS would have for elon is a bullet
3347 2018-05-22 17:57:16 On #WorldGothDay I’d like to ask whether all goths wear patchouli oil?
3348 2018-05-22 17:57:07 Global crude oil price is increasing due to Nehru :PM MODI
3349 2018-05-22 17:57:07 Three factors making equity investors nervous in Emerging Markets:
1. Crude Oil @ $80
2. Rising Interest rates in US
3. Bounce in Dollar index

3351 2018-05-22 17:56:58 @milkadonagi NAGI! Cover the pot, do not douse the oil fire with water.
3352 2018-05-22 17:56:56 Fishing too?
3353 2018-05-22 17:56:52 I JUST PUT THIS NUMBING OIL ON MY WISDOM TOOTH CAUSE ITS KILLING ME AND I GOT IT ON MY LIP N TONGUE AND CAN’T FEEL MY GODDAMN MOUTH I’M
3354 2018-05-22 17:56:41 #BoldandBeautiful Damn these emotional scenes always have me reaching for Kleenex. I think it’s so sad what’s happening  to Liam and Steffy. They don’t deserve being manipulated like this by snake oil salesman Bill.
3355 2018-05-22 17:56:34 Oil? We’ve discovered an oil pipeline!!! 
3356 2018-05-22 17:56:30 I think it was the oil my momma put in my hair 
3357 2018-05-22 17:56:24 I always feel like anytime you bring your car in for an oil change it's opening up yourself to a rip-off. @jiffylube offered to replace my air & cabin filters for $80. I just ordered both for $15 total on @amazon. 5 min installation. No tools required.
3358 2018-05-22 17:56:20 I have no idea why I have the window open and my oil heater on at the same time but the word IDIOT springs to mind 
3359 2018-05-22 17:56:18 By 35 foot pounds of torque your oil pan drain plug ought should be firmly in place until your next scheduled oil change
3360 2018-05-22 17:56:10 What kind of tree is that? I’ve noticed them on my plum, pear and Hawthorne. I think I had them last year too and we’re causing the leaves to curl. I sprayed them with a water-mineral oil-Canola oil mix. Hope it works.
3361 2018-05-22 17:55:52 @NDrules43 This was fantastic.  Skip onion flakes and add a bit more allspice.  You can also roast and grind up 1 to 3 habaneros (remove vein/seeds) depending on your preferred level of spice.  Oil up chicken and cover both sides with mix and throw on grill.
3362 2018-05-22 17:55:46 I hate taking selfies but I’m cool with sitting down for an oil painting. So I guess I’m gonna have to commission something for my LinkedIn profile  #Extra #SupportArtists
3363 2018-05-22 17:55:45 Would have made more sense if they’d already lost the farm and only they knew there was oil. Makes no sense to rob banks when they’re literally sitting on millions in assets.
3364 2018-05-22 17:55:40 It’s another dem ploy. Why would they advocate their own demise?
3365 2018-05-22 17:55:31 Nonsense. There is a temporary revenue bump from oil price, natural gas which is a larger part of the revenue stream is in the tank, the only jobs are a few minimum wage, government AHS hiring or self employed. When you're at rock bottom a slight bump is a big %
It's NDP baloney!

3372 2018-05-22 17:54:58 Trump will have to order a big release from the SPR very soon to save face, that's if he cares about his base and the consumer more than the oil industry.
3373 2018-05-22 17:54:51 Bitches will put a lot of baby oil on in a pic now all of a sudden she modeling lol
3374 2018-05-22 17:54:49 US vs. Standard Oil
3375 2018-05-22 17:54:48 It also occurs to me that when indy happens, all contracts would be renegotiated on more favourable terms, and a new Scottish State Oil company could drill in the Clyde basin when the nukes are expelled.
3376 2018-05-22 17:54:42 Aziza moans cutely as the fox applies the oil to her skin she was getting so turned on from every touch of the oil on her skin so sooner or later the fox would have to touch Aziza's lewd places and maybe she could even "play" with Aziza in bed
3377 2018-05-22 17:54:39 Is there oil there? Start there.
3378 2018-05-22 17:54:35 Ya I wouldn’t fret. Do your regular maintenance with full synthetic oil changes and you can’t go wrong. You’ll wear out before the truck does.
3379 2018-05-22 17:54:35 Psalms  23:5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
3380 2018-05-22 17:54:30 now i cutcking oil
3381 2018-05-22 17:54:29 And DJT is the Purveyor of the vitriolic Snake Oil!
3382 2018-05-22 17:54:20 Yep, those pesky Swedes are already distributing leaflets about an upcoming war. It's only you Danes, us Finns and those Norwegians with their oil wealth who are at risk. You better join the winning side now, us Finns have good form when it comes to war.
3383 2018-05-22 17:54:19 I posted a bigger picture chart last week I think, Oil's in a large bearish wedge so when that breaks down  (support is 70.30ish) now it should open up that deeper move lower. Not sure when it'll happen, but oil does usually see a seasonal peak in June
3384 2018-05-22 17:54:12 A week ago, picked up my car after having to replace the broken tire rods. Friday, took my car for an oil change, replaced two tires with better used tires and patched a third. Today, one of the used tires went flat. Am replacing it and the fourth one that hasn't been fixed.
3385 2018-05-22 17:54:03 Just spray oil
3386 2018-05-22 17:53:54 Like oil and water
3387 2018-05-22 17:53:54 Haah i oil lapho?
3388 2018-05-22 17:53:51 Yeah, but inflated gas prices are taking it back plus. Stop the oil companies. They got their big $$$ tax breaks.
3389 2018-05-22 17:53:50  public health
 housing density
 jobs
 pavement wear
 traffic congestion
 personal debt, cars, oil
3390 2018-05-22 17:53:46 Ignoring climate change is like being willing to drive your family across country in a car that has 250k miles, is overheating, has the check engine light on, never had an oil change, 2 year old expired inspection, no seatbelts and a weird tire at 95mph.  What could go wrong?
3391 2018-05-22 17:53:46 Well the baby oil fake tan thing definitely does NOT work 
3392 2018-05-22 17:53:43 I knew it. By-products from biofuels.Remember when BP blew up&the oil spilled out into the Gulf&they sprayed by planes that crap,they said would disburse the oil=#BP figured we already destroyed the Gulf,let's get rid of the other poisons we have=win win for BP=Toxic waste dump
3393 2018-05-22 17:53:39 I don’t know if it was her email, or benghazi or any of the other smokescreens the Republicans threw out. It turned over a country with a large portion of its populace being so disenfranchised, afraid and angry (racist), that they would fall for the snake oil act.
3394 2018-05-22 17:53:34 i think a lot of theme have patchouly oil in it so i would keep it out of her reach tbh
3395 2018-05-22 17:53:23 This is getting worse as each days passes by !! Too much to ask for , if at all the crude oil rate is getting higher why govt is not reducing the tax on it , I'm against this in toto ... @narendramodi #AbKiBaar100Paar
3396 2018-05-22 17:53:10 Proud to be free of the Opioid Devil. Living the CBD Oil. Full Spectrum! No Opioids for me unless I have surgery or an amputation. 
3397 2018-05-22 17:53:01 I changed mine right away.. just make sure you get the right hoop size so you don’t take it off and on. And quick tip, add tea tree oil on it.
3398 2018-05-22 17:52:59 أعوذ بالله
3399 2018-05-22 17:52:51 There are lot of countries that do not extract oil from areas within their boundaries. Also it would be expensive to set up infrastructure for oil explorations. But having said that, they could have implemented it. Not sure how the Economics would be on that.
3400 2018-05-22 17:52:51 we blew up libya to steal hundreds of billions of gold bullion to stop the afican central bank taking place and to control the oil
3401 2018-05-22 17:52:47 Indian oil are bloodsuckers
3402 2018-05-22 17:52:41 It must have been really hard to fight for oil resources in foreign countries and propel decades of civil wars and conflict
3403 2018-05-22 17:52:32 Oil the cogs x
3404 2018-05-22 17:52:26 My car told me that I need an oil change, but I don't wanna spend another $80. Volkswagen's too expensive  might take it to walmart but I fear they'll mess it up
3405 2018-05-22 17:52:16 What'll be interesting is once all the US refineries can't handle Venezuelan oil anymore.  

That's when they're really screwed.
3406 2018-05-22 17:52:11 It really gets me when people use the expression “blood is thicker than water” at me like as a rebuttal

Like canola oil is thicker than water too... so?
3407 2018-05-22 17:52:09 The oil pipeline is not going to a reservation or on our land ever again or Taking Back to Black Hills we're taking back our lands and South of the Border is now part of us so come over drop your guns drop all your knives walk over here peacefully it's okay there are new country

3412 2018-05-22 17:51:47 I have recently research CBD oil,have been reading many good things about it.Just don't know how well it works for someone who has been opioids,for several years? Not to much info on that .My Mom suffers everyday of her life w/a hereditary disease,they keep taking her meds away
3413 2018-05-22 17:51:47 @SarahDunsworth Miss. Dunsworth, I am sorry to hear about your mother in law & her struggle. Cancer sucks. Just a thought Im throwing your way, but has your mother in law tried: Rick Simpson CBD Oil ? If I'm correct, it cured @tommychong 's #cancer after 1 week or so of use...
3414 2018-05-22 17:51:37 Nice! I'll try it with coconut oil next time — I add coconut oil to all the things idk why it hasn't dawned on me to add it to my coffee.

3421 2018-05-22 17:51:10 Question: Medonc & gastro doc both recommended medium chain triglyceride oil (from coconuts) to slow chylous ascites, with dietary control of long chain triglyceride intake.  I am not an herb & supplement believer, but the limited documentation supported it.  Thoughts?
3422 2018-05-22 17:51:07 This status isn’t for you, then. (Because you’re one of the only ones left to fall for the snake oil salesman. )
3423 2018-05-22 17:51:00 Dry shampoo and leave ins the night before are my friends!! Heat will definitely damage your hair and make it brittle. Also an oil treatment helps reduce breakage and split ends.

3427 2018-05-22 17:50:51 I didn't suggest in the slightest that we stop developing or producing. The province is reliant upon oil revenues to pay for services we require as a society.  During bust times it becomes obvious that wasn't a smart choice.
3428 2018-05-22 17:50:47 You also supply olives to shops? 
3429 2018-05-22 17:50:42 For the past 100 years oil companies have dictated policy in Washington. This will never change.

3432 2018-05-22 17:50:19 And the imorallity of buying conflict oil from terror states when ethical Canadian oil is available is appearant to the vast majority of Canadians. Trust @AndrewScheer to bring Canadian Energy to all Canadians.
3433 2018-05-22 17:50:16 Maybe your driveway leaked gravel over his oil...
3434 2018-05-22 17:50:14 They’ll be telling us there’s oil in the North Sea next
3435 2018-05-22 17:50:09 It's actually helping! I kind of always thought Chiros were snake oil salesmen...but it turns out not so much.

3449 2018-05-22 17:48:34 Only oil will make so!!!! I think  u shud understand the meaning of incompetence
3450 2018-05-22 17:48:11 For the plastics, yes, possibly if the raw material supply chain is steady or in good volume. Being byproducts of crude oil we should be having a huge supply chain of various poly products but Nigeria.
3451 2018-05-22 17:48:06 Unless you’ve got an oil well in your pocket we’re not going to be able to spend like City and buy the league. We have to bring in a manager who has proven he can work with less. Moyes took over a team which had just won the league, hardly the position we’re in now.

3459 2018-05-22 17:47:37 They know it is not in government's hand and being driven by global crude prices. They have faith in Modi government and hopeful of things getting under control once crude oil prices fluctuation comes under control. UPA was concentrating on filling their accounts. Chidambaram ?
3460 2018-05-22 17:47:34 ? Pan fairy oil ?

3465 2018-05-22 17:47:29 Recession was inevitable considering years of poor economic management. Sanusi lamido predicted it, Okonjo Iweala foresaw it. Oil revenue went down by less than half, dollars were thrown around during elections, what did u expect. But we r out of it now, & indices are looking up.
3466 2018-05-22 17:47:24 MY CAT LEAKING OIL. IMMA STILL DRIVE IT THO.
3467 2018-05-22 17:47:21 The one thing I would recommend tho which is basic but important is just always do full synthetic oil changes. Nothing less. The motors respond to it very well long term and will give you less problems down the road. More expensive up front but often cheaper in the end.
3468 2018-05-22 17:47:13 So apply sanctions against a major source of oil that will satisfy Russia.
3469 2018-05-22 17:47:07 Every time I get an oil change, they say I need a new filter. Like wtf how long do them mfs last cause ain’t no way I should need a new one every other month
3470 2018-05-22 17:47:06 I hate oil pulling the texture is just ugh 
3471 2018-05-22 17:47:04 It was 1979. I remember 17% int rates and 3.5 million unemployed, and Thatcher selling off everything that was worth selling, and also had billions from oil revenue.

3474 2018-05-22 17:46:34 All this rubbish that Palm oil is a healthy oil. Although it is a high yield oil, It is very high in saturated fats. Only the kernel oil is considered healthy, but then that is not high yield, so best to avoid completely
3475 2018-05-22 17:46:33 I’m over here begging my dad to make my appointment to get my oil changed and he just keeps laughing at me telling me “hell no”

3479 2018-05-22 17:46:07   After Presidential Press Conference with Moon Stock Market Falls. Gold rises a bit. Oil Prices high $72.14 a barrell. which has added .10 to the price of gas in the last 2 weeks.
3480 2018-05-22 17:46:01 it was really hard to hear over the sound of large Diesel engines at the oil sands where you were now working
3481 2018-05-22 17:45:34 Still Delhi has the lowest price of oil among the others metropolitan cities...
3482 2018-05-22 17:45:24 Sir bring oil under GST immediately with out wasting time...people loosing patience. .

3485 2018-05-22 17:45:05 The safest ships in the area would be these oil tankers. Super Tugs attached and escorted until open water. If your concern is genuine, you best get to protesting BC Ferries, whom have a much much worse record.

3487 2018-05-22 17:44:50 Nahi sir it was due to bad policies of UPA. Infact they made Right to food for 67% of population on which this year subsidy is 1,59,000 Cr. Yes it is 1.59 Lakh cr 
Similarly they never invested in Oil exploration & Shale at the time when Oil was 130+
3488 2018-05-22 17:44:39 Cobain aja nder tapi jangan jenis oil yg sama. Kali aja ga cocok tuh sama jenis oilnya bukan sama merk-nya

3490 2018-05-22 17:44:35 They have been “on the rise” for 6 months. This isn’t new, specially for diesel, which used to be significantly cheaper than gas. Since it was a waste product of refining gas, it was much cheaper. Now it’s much more expensive. Oil companies on the take again.

3496 2018-05-22 17:43:52 "Then there emerged a Nigerian and two Italians who had tried to get rich in the acquisition of an offshore oil field in Nigeria. Now it's the turn of a Swiss, Giovanni Mahler (no one calls him Carlo). "

3498 2018-05-22 17:43:43 Not off the top of my head, but I think we can cook something up. Sounds like you need more than just a Lavender essential oil.
3499 2018-05-22 17:43:36 You might be surprised at how much oil is left in a syringe after a fully depressed plunger. If you're paying for it yourself, you want all the T you supposed to get.
3500 2018-05-22 17:43:35 what were you trying? Counting calories worked for me idk, I think the rest is overselling it/snake oil

3504 2018-05-22 17:43:21 Ok, I tend to use EVOO, coconut oil, Mac oil, but have never used avocado oil, so it’s good to use as well?
3505 2018-05-22 17:43:09 Yes everything has changed ,earlier price of fuel was much lesser despite high crude oil price and now it is too high despite low crude oil price.
3506 2018-05-22 17:42:51 Like to say opec. Even though our national oil is growing, just not fast enough. 
We have oil reserves, refineries and our cost is low compared to Cali yet politicians hint on taxing more
3507 2018-05-22 17:42:41 The problem with Venezuela is that it is a puppet Government placed by USA Shadow Government and its deep state.

All for the sake of running oil tanks

3515 2018-05-22 17:41:55 Yea I've seen the history, like when the US/UK removed the democratically elected PM of Iran and inserted a dictator because they had the gall to want to control their own oil, the UN can go in whenever they want and inspect their facilities, what kind of deal would be better?

3528 2018-05-22 17:40:39 But, Howard Dean...
3529 2018-05-22 17:40:36 Oh yes that’s why it’s never went down when intl crude oil price was at lowest but increases when it increases still its far lower than earlier times but fuel prices are highest ever. Do u know that excise duty on fuel was raised 200 % by Modi. If not then pls read
3530 2018-05-22 17:40:34 So perhaps the move in the price of #oil is not dependent solely upon supply/demand fundamentals. Currency issues, geopolitics, etc.

#PetroYuan #PetroGold #OOTT
3531 2018-05-22 17:40:30 Scary that oil is the one thing preventing a massive trade deficit
3532 2018-05-22 17:40:28 Name some things that would create as much revenue as oil. I ask again. Why are we shooting ourselves in the foot?  Other  countries would love  to have our resources and you can bet they would be promoting them.
3533 2018-05-22 17:40:28 "pastels are mores uited to a young womens hands. oil paintings are for MEN because they take skill to use and are intellectual"??? thats so funny

3535 2018-05-22 17:40:25 I know you have divergent tactics to shed Modi Govt from Oil Price hikes. How long you are going to protect/hide such move of reckless Modi govt who don’t care for common man.

3542 2018-05-22 17:39:50 I kinda need you to get on the phone and tell those Oil Companies to “Get those prices down.” I do not know if you can or can’t do this but you said one time Mr. President that you didn’t know why other presidents in the past didn’t. If it’s not possible I understand.
3543 2018-05-22 17:39:49 hey remember when mark was making eggs but forgot to oil the pan and then he chaotically poured oil on the already cooked eggs

Putin's Pruitt is proud that he's not addressing contaminated water while the price of oil is artificially increased
3547 2018-05-22 17:39:33 What about macadamia nut oil
3548 2018-05-22 17:39:24 Its the same thing with oil, amazon and tesla they all use govt. Subsidies. Govt just giving away money to the wealthy. Same with "Trumps" corporate tax cuts
3549 2018-05-22 17:39:19 During UPA, fuel prices were lowest, when compared to the International crude oil price, thanks to the people-friendly policies of Manmohan Singh govt. #AbkiBaar100Paar

3555 2018-05-22 17:38:42 @sureshpprabhu Sir request you to take the issue of Cotton Ginning and Oil Mill at priority basis otherwise all the small players will exhaust as there will be no capital to keep the industry going as entire margin is eaten up in Rule 42 Reversal of GST. RCM& Rule 42 hurting.
3556 2018-05-22 17:38:24 So cute. He will always have fond memories of these times. Of course, I grew up in the marshlands of south Louisiana and spent my childhood fishing w/ my daddy off the first oil structures in the Gulf of Mexico. But for us, it was (and still is) "catch and FILET!" Yum!

3563 2018-05-22 17:37:34 Yeah, just wish I was wrong about some of this stuff :(. Gets so tiring seeing the country in turmoil like this.

3574 2018-05-22 17:36:23 no the only people dependent on oil is the oil corporation's since we can manufacture synthetic oil .
3575 2018-05-22 17:36:14 And if we wait for that, it will never happen. Trump did what no others were willing to do, comply with what our Congress voted on two decades ago.

3587 2018-05-22 17:35:11 Olive oil and coconut oil seem stable during cooking, as are possibly most lower PUFA oils. Even w/o cooking, some oils may come w/  less desirable components due to processing methods during their production (grapeseed oil, for example, seems to be an example).
3588 2018-05-22 17:35:07 I don’t know you but I’m literally drinking butter coffee as I read this. I put half butter half coconut oil and it’s very nice.

3603 2018-05-22 17:34:01 Heard when visited Thiruvarur Thyagarajar temple. There was no oil for lighting the sanctorum diyas. Outer Mandapas were paddy bags stacked with a munshi.told the belonged to temple.
almost all Nayanmars wrote poems over the deity but no oil for deepams.
3604 2018-05-22 17:33:48 Pls tell us what they say they want to do? For more than 6 decades, about 6 states, out of the 36 states of Nigeria, continue to provide the oil that sustains Nigeria. Six southern states. Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Delta, Bayelsa state and the others.
3605 2018-05-22 17:33:46 @sureshpprabhu 1/1 Sir, Cotton Ginning and Oil Mills are facing lot of issues from GST. Firstly Cotton is brought under compulsory RCM payment which does not get fully utilised because one of the output products (20%) is exempt. Blockage of funds and then Rule 42 of GST.
3606 2018-05-22 17:33:42 Hey!!!! I’m literally at the “fast service” oil change spot as we speak. Been getting that fast service for about an hour now....
3607 2018-05-22 17:33:37 So I’m in deep do do. Mum spent £45 on 5ltrs of special oil for the car. She put it on a high shelf in the shed. I barged into the shed, destroyed the shelving & caused said container of oil to fall to the floor. Quick as a flash I nabbed it, chewed it and caused an oil spill

3609 2018-05-22 17:33:33 Today an old woman walking on  the sidewalk ahead of me legitimately dumped two bags of popcorn and breadcrumbs between us like an oil slick in Mario Kart, and pigeons descended on me from blocks away. She didn’t break stride, and I think she’s my hero
3610 2018-05-22 17:33:31 I woke up this morning and my dad tells me “I was looking at your car this morning and thought it might need a wash so I took it for an oil change, full car wash and filled up your tank”  I literally have the best Dad in the world.
3611 2018-05-22 17:33:23 oh wait, it is described as a “serum oil” so maybe that counts?!
3612 2018-05-22 17:33:16 Exactly.
3613 2018-05-22 17:33:12 Wow thats great! Thanks for the update! Its about time as many cultures have known about the medicinal uses of hemp & cannabis oil for forever.. 
3614 2018-05-22 17:32:50 The grandson of the most evil Queen on earth queen elizabeth, Prince Harry and his wife should go and join the fulani terrorist tribe already on grand, so that they can kill all the over 70million Biafrans, so that blood oil will keep following to the evil british royal family.

3625 2018-05-22 17:31:24 One question: I know you support regime change, but can you explain the mechanism? Is there any safe way. 

I mean what if Iran becomes another Syria? I think what Pompeo said on new US policies would end in oil-for-food program (right?). 

Please write an article on this. PLEASE
3626 2018-05-22 17:31:23 This is a distraction from what we need to focus on: ending subsidies  for oil & gas companies that are literally putting all of our lives at stake.  Wrong message to promote more driving!

3647 2018-05-22 17:29:44 Last night Michelle gave me a thumbnail sized glob of CBD oil because my leg really hurt and I got ludicrously high and then she drove us to Dairy Queen and we got twix blizzards and it was the best thing that's ever happened to me.
3648 2018-05-22 17:29:40 See...which goes back to my original  thought.

3650 2018-05-22 17:29:27 The hype is fair but a pointless activity. At the very least, until we see him in the AHL it means nothing. We have seen far too many star goaltender's in junior crash and burn in the pros. Skinner certainly has a shot at being the answer but...

Bt now it is under 60$

Then he the prize increase.. U didn't understand means.  Better that u may go and joint pre schools.
3664 2018-05-22 17:27:58 Laughable. We live in a smokeless zone yet within 3 miles is an oil refinery, a chemical complex and a fertiliser plant, all spewing out pollution. Yet you want to ban my bloody stove.
3665 2018-05-22 17:27:55 Valid perspective. I don't think energy use has to be a bad thing for the environment. I think PoW has merit, directly incentivizes making energy more efficiently. I think green energy sources like geothermal, can potentially provide unlimited energy, replacing dependence on oil.

3678 2018-05-22 17:27:01 Alright
Whether or not it's done out of necessity, which I fully do not believe after they struck oil with TTG, it still looks bad and lazily done
3679 2018-05-22 17:26:55 Russia will benefit through a rise in oil prices. They have been pumping more than the OPEC restriction agreement allows so they can cash in on the price spike when the US moves to implement these sanctions.

Russia makes a ton of money & gain credibility.

3703 2018-05-22 17:24:21 so high that it results in trade surplus. Surplus caused by oil exports and $80/barrel oil should counsel against tariffs. If oil is that large a part of our economy a large recession would follow a decline in price of oil. History teaches that energy markets are volatile.

3724 2018-05-22 17:22:42 You want to be Saudi Arabia and every other country that produces oil until the oil sector collapse then what do you think will happen when there's no more oil. All the oil producing countries will crumble.
3725 2018-05-22 17:22:37 The keyword in there is "intent"...sh*t happens ;)

3727 2018-05-22 17:22:28 Because oil burning wasn't confined back then. Now that new rules has been administered, there is some scope to exploit loopholes - which generally raises some enqueries. Therefore, they have the privilege to raise those concerns.

3729 2018-05-22 17:22:16 Check whole tweet. I strongly believe that govt should roll frame e-vehicles policy. I am just expressing my views that when crude oil was $107 at that time petrol was not even 75 now it's just 86 and still we are shelling 78.? Might not be relevant for you but certainly for many

3755 2018-05-22 17:20:00 @adhia03 2/2 There should be no applicability of Rule 42/43 for inwards RCM payments. In Industry like Cotton Ginning and Oil Mill, where 100% purchases are based on RCM, reversing 20% (exempt sales) of RCM payment under Rule 42/43 is total loss to the industry.

Brian Jean is full of BS!
Alberta wanted to have their oil sold on world market, not just to Canada. So if AB oil is being discounted by 22% that’s Albertans own doing NOT the rest of Canada.
3799 2018-05-22 17:16:07 2/2. Apart from the dying industry that is AB oil, competition from the new LOOP port, AB keeps pushing its bitumen like its BCs responsibility. Easiest step by BC?? Shut down the ports to ALL exports from and imports to AB. We can turn off the LNG taps too if she'd like.

3814 2018-05-22 17:15:00 In Econ 1 trade deficits are irrelevant (Ricardo). Nations with high GDP tend to run trade deficits because they have the purchasing power. China has huge economy, but low GDP, therefore China should have a trade surplus. The only caveat to this is if our exports of oil are 1/2

3818 2018-05-22 17:14:40 Chief among the issues Mr Nyantakyi according to sources would reportedly be required to answer would be if he took monies under the pretence of giving the president kick back for an oil deal the Dubai guys 'were coming along with'

3845 2018-05-22 17:11:53 No actually oil has been rising due to the well reported production cuts by Russia and OPEC since last year. The inventory glut is just about gone. In addition production from Venezuela has dropped. Geo-political tensions have had a minor effect.

3984 2018-05-22 16:58:31 What do you want Our Revolution to do for you Audrey? Maybe push Fracking or GMO or maybe more wars or Big Pharma, Bg Oil, Big Banks or maybe more tax cuts for the rich?

3989 2018-05-22 16:57:34 I went to a doctor today who didn’t immediately prescribe a drug for my symptoms, but gave me 2 books to read for knowledge & a deeper understanding of whats going on, vitamins to take, & some essential oil suggestions.
3990 2018-05-22 16:57:28 Right, it was the Saudi’s arming Assad, Hezbollah, the Iranians and let’s not forget ISIS. Did you see what happen to the oricof oil when Donnie walked out of the Iranian deal?
3991 2018-05-22 16:57:19 Try getting some peppermint oil!! Just like two drops under your nostrils and then steam. I promise it’ll all break up and you’ll breathe better

3998 2018-05-22 16:56:38 Mmmm and you think relying on the oil industry is the solution? Can we not learn from other countries using alternative energy sources other than oil? What will happen to a country reliant on the oil industry when oil runs dry?

4002 2018-05-22 16:56:12 Makes sense.  I just think if the Rockets wanted to learn about oil and gas investing or the Knicks about hedge fund investing that they would have access to similar communities.   It would be great to see the returns that the warriors are actually achieving.
4003 2018-05-22 16:56:06 Lol at the amount of oil being used on my toes. Damn are they that ashy and whatever else lol let me stop playing all I do is clean my feet and exfoliate from time to time.

4016 2018-05-22 16:55:21 If oil work on the market basis, why do we have the petroleum ministry. Please abolish it and let the minister to sit at home. We don't want a post office type ministry.
4017 2018-05-22 16:55:19 I use avocado oil for its high smoke point, the hotter the pan and oil, the better. Then, you can glaze with teriyaki, balsamic, etc. #sweepstakes #AllNaturalPork

4019 2018-05-22 16:55:02 It really pissed these guys off that it was during Obama’s 8 years that oil prices fell and inventories rose, and at the same time progress began to be made on domestic policy for alternative energy. All reversed in just one year.

4032 2018-05-22 16:53:43 That said, we have to allow offshore oil drilling, and fracking, everywhere there is oil to be found. Drill, baby, drill! This will mean ignoring the greeniewhackos, who would, if they could, make energy ruinously expensive. Look at CA!

4034 2018-05-22 16:53:35 And what was the price of crude oil..
4035 2018-05-22 16:53:34 100% yes if it doesn't have a lot of butter or oil in it. I'd be vary of icing.
4036 2018-05-22 16:53:31 Now that's  a complete  lie Dear Anand.Amit Shah clearly  said  Petroleum minister will  discuss  the  matter with oil companies. Expect  some reduction  in the  price in 3 to 4 days
4037 2018-05-22 16:53:26 And this type of news grow exponentially with oil price going up...
4038 2018-05-22 16:53:23 I’ve seen it, and I want more. Perhaps a show where you and @christinagausas play Beat Cops, but you get a Souped up Batmobile/Green Hornet chair that can outrun perps and also throw down oil slicks and smoke screens and stuff and also you sing karaoke with @ARizzo44 every week.
4039 2018-05-22 16:53:19 fuck the Edmonton Oil Kings
4040 2018-05-22 16:53:19 Except we are out of recession and experiencing fantastic economic growth despite oil still being ~50% less than in 2014. So you're a little bit right, but also a good amount wrong.
4041 2018-05-22 16:53:16 You know your getting old when you get happy about getting new tires and an oil change.
4042 2018-05-22 16:53:10 Why was that insignificant ministerPradhan having a meeting with oil companies when none of them are empowered to fiddle with these prices? It is the Finance Ministry that needs to put its house in order.
4043 2018-05-22 16:53:01 also, the biggest mistake is the salad dressing-google youtube-Dr. berg/keto/salad dressing...almost all salad dressings at stores contain canola oil/soy which is a cheap ingredient that prevents us from losing weight...I get mine on line with organic avocado oil/olive oil etc

4057 2018-05-22 16:51:56 Essentially what Alberta is asking is that they run an oil hose through the living room of BC. And if there’s a spill from that hose they promised to, over time, do the best they can to clean the oil out of BCs living room carpet. BC absorbs the risk and receives no direct reward

4070 2018-05-22 16:50:32 The biggest consumer scams is high oil prices. In 1979 the government created an oil shortage keeping oil tankers in the Gulf of Mexico not allowing them to unload. SInce Trump met in Saudia Arabia, oil prices has contined 2 rise. A tax break is worthless with gas prices rising.

"I don't want to be thumbing our nose at the oil and gas industry," says @JonDziadyk, advocating a focus on simply reducing energy use in buildings and lights. #yegcc

4114 2018-05-22 16:45:33 @PiyushGoyal bring Oil in GST
4115 2018-05-22 16:45:15 Bloody we don't do anything for the country having so much population and consumer of 82% Oil today...for love of India and air pollution..will you do Car pooling 2 days a week and people who ride bike will you go by Bus for 1 day a week...do something for this planet Earth..

4117 2018-05-22 16:45:09 The big oil companies raped the land of it's commodity and left. Disgusting way to treat many of these countries who are rich in commodities...the government's politicians who are corrupt make the money...it the same with mining 
4118 2018-05-22 16:45:01 The oil business:  The most corrupt industry in the world!
4119 2018-05-22 16:44:53 RIGHT?!  I'm so bad about lotion but I've been good lately putting just a bit of baby oil on after.

4121 2018-05-22 16:44:42 You don’t even use coconut oil 
4122 2018-05-22 16:44:39 #MobsterTrump licenses things. He's a brand, nothing but a multiple-bankrupt, fraudulent, snake oil salesman, con man facade. He sells junk from China, why should he upset them. 

Plus Indonesia and other emerging markets as noted in The Dossier.
4123 2018-05-22 16:44:35 Couldn't agree more tbh. Opportunities can be made in any job and all jobs have dead ends.

If you want to build resilience to deal with the unexpected, regularly and under pressure then HD can be good.

In my case it was for a major oil company, the rig is down was always fun!

4140 2018-05-22 16:43:15 During last four years, Modi has disturbed the budget of the working class, by unconditionally increasing the fuel prices, despite of low price of International crude oil. #AbkiBaar100Paar
4141 2018-05-22 16:43:14 Gas was got down to at least $1.60 at one point that year in some states. No way were u paying that at that time that’s b.s. The price of oil was dropping during that time. Ppl in the oilfield were getting laid off cuz the prices were so low.
4142 2018-05-22 16:43:07 Keep this going!
4143 2018-05-22 16:43:05 Cool, in this case digital painting is the classic painting like oil, with brushes only, with not shapes?

4148 2018-05-22 16:42:42 No, not "in general". Many true radicals and progressives do NOT think like Killary. She's just another multimillionaire in the pocket of oil companies and is part of the war machine.

4150 2018-05-22 16:42:34 In 1990 India imported 37% of oil it consumed while in 2012 it imported a staggering 82% of consumed oil, pushing the import bill to $120 billionand making it the energy source with the highest import dependency.
Why India is spending $330 million a day on imported oil and gas
4151 2018-05-22 16:42:32 Euro signing & Skinner development put Oil miles ahead in the position from weeks ago when it amounted to crossing fingers Cam that recovers form & plays 70 gms per yr for next half decade.
4152 2018-05-22 16:42:18 Tory / social media guile = Oil / water.
4153 2018-05-22 16:42:15 Also oil is not a scarce “fossil fuel” this was made up by the Rockefellers to inflate prices. Oil is the blood of the living earth and we have become parasitic vampires upon our host organism.
4154 2018-05-22 16:42:09 Changing breaks, oil change, bunch of shit...I hate cars
4155 2018-05-22 16:41:55 Um I've never heard of this service, by it could be because oil and gas prices have jumped up and continue to rise around the country due to certain events in the Middle East
4156 2018-05-22 16:41:45 I went to get my oil change before we left  them niggas opened at I7 the manager refused to open the garage for the mechanics til like 745 it was like 10 people waiting I had to go somewhere else

4158 2018-05-22 16:41:42 As per my knowledge if this time oil brought to GST it will be available at higher prices than it is now because of tax structure

4160 2018-05-22 16:41:37 Sir the taxes are already way beyond your expectation...you want to reach at tax slab of 100%  or more to compensate on reducing few Rupees on oil prices...are you insane. There are city buses, metros, local trains and many other alternate transport mechanisms please use them!!
4161 2018-05-22 16:41:36 In 9 days , Petrol is increased by 2.24. , Diesel is increased by 2.15 . Centre and 20 states are ruled by BJP.

I think states & center needs to go to rehab, to cure themselves of addiction to oil revenues! 

Find some other source. 

Example - They can tax bidis heavily.

It is simple.
4168 2018-05-22 16:41:11 same fulani Secretary General of OPEC made this leaping oil price possible since a decade ago
4169 2018-05-22 16:41:09 Canada is strong when the environment is healthy. Unfortunately, Alberta is horribly diseased with oil/gas pollution. You have billions of dollars of toxic cleanup to do in your province; maybe talk to the rest of us when you've responsibly dealt with that. #StopKM
4170 2018-05-22 16:41:09 Annoyingly, the CBD oil caps were more expensive than the kind that get you high. And taxed 25% here in the People's Republic of Idiotofornia.

4192 2018-05-22 16:39:38 Canada not producing more oil just means other countries will produce more oil to meet increasing demand  ...... where should the oil come from, ethical Canada or dictators with abysmal human rights standards
4193 2018-05-22 16:39:38 As I read that, he was looking at the dilutive properties of shale oil  in producing lower sulfur fuel oil to meet demand under the new IMO rule, not what IMO means for changes in the market for non-crude oil feedstocks to downstream processing units, e.g. coking.

4212 2018-05-22 16:38:10 Shouldnt paint decking. It cracks in the sun and need stripped and done again. Oil it with a natural oil. It nourishes the wood, stops it from fading and it retains its natural colour which looks better anyway.

Those who are crying for petrol prices they first should rethink do they pay actuall taxes that are incurred on our income do thwy pay gst whenever they buy anything??? We are the main reason behind all these surplus charges on oil... Stop playing victim card

However if you compare it quarter on quarter, its a dip from the 2.11% in 2017 Q4. This growth is driven by oil production nd prices increase @seunonigbinde @BudgITng @SaharaReporters

A true people's govt would have used that revenue for bettering the lives of Indians.

Can BJP answer where has all the profit gone?

4302 2018-05-22 16:29:54 while you offer up a plausible explanation why then did ISIS conveniently show up @ same time as Leviathan oil pipeline & Israels need to grasp the real estate in the area? foreign policy especially in Israels case is never coincidental...ever

4304 2018-05-22 16:29:45 Why is smoking perceived as "cool" if Im wearing a leather jacket and complaining about capitalism, but not when I'm wearing steel toed boots and covered in oil?
4305 2018-05-22 16:29:38 GP It's simply dealing with the underlying problem by taking away something important to most nations: access to USD denominated transactions. Oil is sold in dollars, so ...
4306 2018-05-22 16:29:30 Have you seen the price of a gallon of gas lately? What crumb drizzled down to the average American has gone directly back to the oil companies who already reaped huge tax cuts and deregulation. Can't wait to vote you traitor supporters out of office
4307 2018-05-22 16:29:29 The truly scary thing, however, is that there are still so many people that are buying his snake oil. Even after the day by day scandals and drama and outright lies, these idiots still think he's doing good. All he has to do is repeat a silly catch phrase at a rally
4308 2018-05-22 16:29:20 So clearly there is enough oil in the supply chain and another pipeline is unnecessary.
4309 2018-05-22 16:29:18 Overheard in Aldi a while ago. Chap to young son who are obviously trying the place out. Ludo, run and get daddy an extra virgin olive oil will you." Now they have a selection of nice oils but I wonder how many shoppers named Ludo?
4310 2018-05-22 16:29:12 I think you can do stuff with oil that is simply impossible with anything else. But, when I get to paint, I use acrylic these days, mostly because it's more practical in my small work room.
4311 2018-05-22 16:29:08 What’s the prize for $200? Asking for a friend, of course.

4313 2018-05-22 16:29:01 CBD oil has shown to be effective in treating pretty much anything it’s been tried on yet the government won’t prescribe it as there “may be some risks”. I’m prescribed pills to take daily that come with two pages of side effects, no one’s worried about the risks there are they?
4314 2018-05-22 16:28:59 If you factor in that production costs have halved since 2014 oil is almost back to its highest profitability ever.
4315 2018-05-22 16:28:58 You can dilute with a thinner carrier oil like coconut or almond oil. But honestly I can't use it anymore cus it's to thick. A little goes a long way for a scalp massage
4316 2018-05-22 16:28:49 is it coincidence the moment Nawaz Sharif was ousted, oil prices started to climb at are higher than what they were at the start of 2014( above $80 dollars a barrel)? This reason is enough to 're-elect' the guy :P
4317 2018-05-22 16:28:47 @KQEDForum Can we really call the fossil fuel industry as competitive when the Oil Industry gets subsided by government directed taxpayer money unlike any other.
4318 2018-05-22 16:28:42 Brent crude oil has retaken $80/bbl as WTI tries for $73/bbl. In addition, wholesale #gasprices are up again with Chicago RBOB tying for the most expensive gallon in the country.
4319 2018-05-22 16:28:35 We do not agree with the oil sharing formula @UKenyatta is using, it should be 70% to the national government, 20% to the county government and 10% to the local government. But we will agree because we have no choice, after all Kenya isn't for Kenyans
4320 2018-05-22 16:28:31 So, you're saying we already have plenty of oil WITHOUT the pipeline?
4321 2018-05-22 16:28:28 @PatUnleashed diesel $3.89 in Alaska... and, the oil pipeline passes right through my town... on its way to China...

I believe the only way to do this is to shrink federal government, handle more at state level.
While I’m no fan of Trump being Trump, I believe we needed to stop the rest of the world from thinking we’re pushovers.
4324 2018-05-22 16:28:19 Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday said the government was looking at ways to keep the rising fuel prices in check. They are still finding out ways while the prices are at record-high. #AbkiBaar100Paar

4343 2018-05-22 16:27:14 I’m not sure what that has to do with the discussion at hand but probably not. Oil use set to peak around 2030, just in time for our grandkids and kids to pay the climate debt for us not attending to necessary targets.
4344 2018-05-22 16:27:11 Rahul ji, aapko pata hai ki 2014 mein international crude oil 148 dollar tha, 2015-16-17 mein 30 dollars tha aur ab 78 dollar hai. Fir bhi petrol ka rate all time high hai. Aapka ye screenshot galat hai
4345 2018-05-22 16:27:09 Why? That was never going to happen. Palestine will never accept anything less than the full destruction of Israel and the takeover of every bit of land. If we waited for that, it would never happen. He did was our Congress approved two decades ago. It was more than time for it.
4346 2018-05-22 16:27:04 Rockefeller tried his whole career to corner the market through cutthroat competition, and all that happened was that the price of kerosene went down and down, and Standard Oil gradually lost market share.
4347 2018-05-22 16:27:03 It’s an apples and oranges argument. If I own Demp Oil Inc and it’s gonna cost me 750 million dollars to develop a location, and the market will only return me 500 Million. Why in God’s name would I lose 250 million?

4350 2018-05-22 16:26:47 I am worried what will happen if oil price goes beyond $90 and rupee at ₹70. Our forex reserves will dry up. Somehow I feel ex PM MMS economic reforms was much better except last 2 years. 2/2

4353 2018-05-22 16:26:22 What @incindia UPA 2 govt left for @narendramodi in 2014

1 A balance payment of $6.7 billion to Iran for Crude Import

2 An average of 100000 Cr debt on all indian oil Mkt companies

3 No strategic reserve of Fuel for our armed forces

4 No strategic reserve of Fuel for nation

4365 2018-05-22 16:24:49 Indeed, Denmark are the ones to look at. Many countries need to detach themselves from corporate links to big oil, and stop subsidising fossil fuels first, then we can progress

4370 2018-05-22 16:24:36 COMO MEDIR EL ACEITE DE MOTOR:
1- APAGA EL VEHÍCULO: Se necesita el vehículo nivelado y frió para hacer una medida correcta del aceite
2- BUSCAR LA VARILLA DE ACEITE: Levantar el capot y buscar la varilla para medir el aceite. Se encuentra identificada con la palabra aceite u oil

4376 2018-05-22 16:24:07 During last four years, Modi has disturbed the budget of the working class, by unconditionally increasing the fuel prices, despite of low price of International crude oil. #AbkiBaar100Paar

4379 2018-05-22 16:23:30 Funny you should ask. I started it in acrylic in 2013, then abandoned it until a couple of months ago when I decided to finish it in oil. #MyNewLove
4380 2018-05-22 16:23:20 i love going to the beach and watching people drown themselves in sunscreen while i’m currently baking myself with tanning oil 
4381 2018-05-22 16:23:18 Feeling sorry for the Turkana people. We all know they are right and we all know that they getting nothing from that oil.

4383 2018-05-22 16:23:17 ...I accidentally gave @Creepy_Priest18 a lecture on the processes of orange oil and alcohol separation
4384 2018-05-22 16:22:54 It should surprise no one that #Russia acts one way when oil is $48 a barrel (July ‘15) & another when it’s pushing $80 (now).  When you’re broke, you’ll try anything.
4385 2018-05-22 16:22:50 I look like an egg dipped in oil. Ya girl is warm SON!
4386 2018-05-22 16:22:48 The 2nd largest oil reserve in the world is in Texas. Don’t have to deal with tree huggers or arctic cold. The more extreme or distant the location is, the higher market price it takes to make it worth it to explore.

4388 2018-05-22 16:22:45 However,every union needs vetting too,ESPECIALLY the UAE, who looks to be pushing a Big Oil agenda.
4389 2018-05-22 16:22:41 There are several Tunisian products that should be introduced in the American open market such as Tunisia's high-quality biological olive oil and Tunisia are the world's top producers and we have to create new markets outside the European space.
4390 2018-05-22 16:22:41 Okay for the main ingredient, If you don't get chicken, you can use @BTS_twt haters. First we r gonna put some oil on it, kerosene oil will be the best! Then some salt and pepper and chilli, some rotten socks instead of garlic, some shit instead of ginger paste. Then you just
4391 2018-05-22 16:22:29 Oil or acrylic?... 
4392 2018-05-22 16:22:19 Please ask the person who provided you the data to give you the corresponding data w.r.t. crude oil prices and tax charged by govt. Then only your data will be true or else it is just a manipulation to cheat people.
4393 2018-05-22 16:22:09 Well I guess festival season really is in full swing. I just ordered 381 oil bottles, 100 cologne bottles and 400 tops.

4399 2018-05-22 16:21:47 I have to admit this & hope you understand; I laughed when I read TENS unit! May as well hand your Dad a toy egg beater & tell him it’s a TENS unit. Modern day snake oil/patent cure. It chaps my fanny that our vets are treated so poorly.
4400 2018-05-22 16:21:44 Didn’t expect to work from home today but it’s allowing me to do laundry and get my oil changed so I’m not upset
4401 2018-05-22 16:21:38 Name that firm.
$100 that there are obvious and direct ties to the Lieberals.
I also catch a whiff that the pace will slow if this route is seen as one to move #alberta oil.
Just watch.
@MikeHudema, any plans you are on the move to #manitoba?
#canada is asking.

4402 2018-05-22 16:21:37 That hot oil treatment got my hair soft asf 
4403 2018-05-22 16:21:18 I knew I didn’t need an oil change

4405 2018-05-22 16:21:09 Lo que nunca oirás es mencionar el peak oil, al menos hasta que haya quedado atrás y la cosa se ponga (aún) más fea.
4406 2018-05-22 16:21:05 If you drive the cost of oil down, to sub 50.00 again. Then dominoes start to tumble. 
1. We shut stuff in because the margin isn’t there to produce it
2. We stop drilling because why spend that money for no demand. 
3. We start laying a shit ton of people off. 
4. It keeps going
4407 2018-05-22 16:20:42 Better for the environment if he kept his mouth shut because every time he opens it he exhales noxious, poisonous  bile...and snake oil.
4408 2018-05-22 16:20:33 Of course. Making such a promise before a final status agreement was a bad idea.
4409 2018-05-22 16:20:24 Forget about reducing our dependence on oil, we have to reduce @PMOIndia's dependence on oil taxes.
4410 2018-05-22 16:20:21 As the oil prize rises upto 80$ per barrel ,there is need for everyone to hold this govt accountable before foreign fulani herdsmen destroys what's left of this nation
4411 2018-05-22 16:20:11 Data is the new oil. Anyone/anything with data weilds enormous potential. Huge economy. AI is the new electricity running on oil. @gerdleonhard #ipsummit2018
4412 2018-05-22 16:20:03 Ok Jasmine is like a big fave of witches everywhere, including me. I love the oil and using the dried flowers. but my god, having a living jasmine plant in my house is the most amazing thing. There are maybe 3 tiny flowers open and yet the fragrance is genuinely intoxicating
4413 2018-05-22 16:19:54 They clearly think that Scotland is going independent and know that the pound will plummet without Scottish Oil propping it up.
The question is do we want to prop up the pound of a failed state of Britain?

4416 2018-05-22 16:19:33 Just waited for 2 hours for an oil change that never even happened. When I was told @Walmart cheap, they didn't mention the service too... the tech literally worked on all the wrong cars & I literally heard that be said to them...
4417 2018-05-22 16:19:30 I wonder if there isn't a technique or two for making the #smoke from #wood-burning less #toxic? Perhaps already some earlier culture had the Providence to find, miraculously, that some oil for example when put in the fire would make smoke less health-damaging?
4418 2018-05-22 16:19:22 coming from the 49 year old fatass sitting on twitter greasing his dick up with oil from some bacon strips he scarfed down earlier to beat his dick to a twitter video

Especially for the cheapest form of renewable energy. Efficiency.

4432 2018-05-22 16:18:29 It's not that. Our current federal government has a bit of an issue with building oil pipelines. Trudeau don't want anymore oil being developed.
4433 2018-05-22 16:18:10 What if it is a steam powered UFO?  The aliens might have a thing for coal and oil.

4440 2018-05-22 16:17:22 Hmmm, The Contaminants Summit... Lemme guess, this is the one where @EPAScottPruitt says HIS @EPA is doing everything it can to remove Contaminants and are saving American's lives...

Whilst simultaneously calling his Big Oil/Industry Overlords, from his soundproof booth, no regs
4441 2018-05-22 16:17:20 Why meetings with oil cos, only taxes hiked by centre needs to be reduced to the level when they came in power
4442 2018-05-22 16:17:18 You do realize that every president over the last several decades has said they were going to move the embassy to Jerusalem and recognize it as the capitol, don’t you?
4443 2018-05-22 16:17:15 Let's talk about oil price first. You are such a hypocrite...
4444 2018-05-22 16:16:49 It swungs American public opinion in Israels favor. It provides the pretext for the illegal oil wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
4445 2018-05-22 16:16:47 Do ya get it...or are you going to remain in the #ConnedByTrump category? He's nothing but a cruel clown  of the 'snake oil salesman' variety
4446 2018-05-22 16:16:46 Fuel prices are directly linked to crude oil. OPEC countries have reduced supplies. Demand has gone up n the supply is less. We r d largest oil importer @$80.  only way to reduce price is to reduce VAT of state taxes by state govt. Check all data's  in Google for reference.

4448 2018-05-22 16:16:34 Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday said the government was looking at ways to keep the rising fuel prices in check. They are still finding out ways while the prices are at record-high. #AbKiBaar100Paar

4452 2018-05-22 16:16:21 Just made my own salad dressing at work. 

If you're shocked i keep olive oil, balsamic, salt, pepper, oregano and Parmesan cheese at my desk, you must be new here.
4453 2018-05-22 16:16:12 D Trump you cannot bludgeon everybody into agreeing with you. Try giving a little to oil the wheels of talks, more will be achieved and your deal making skills enhanced Without the might of the US military you wouldn't have a chance of any deal. A deal under duress is a bad deal.
4454 2018-05-22 16:16:11 Stop paying fuel subsidy and let petrol price float freely with oil price and invest the money in health care and education.

4458 2018-05-22 16:15:57 the oil and gas industry lobbies for permission to drill offshore, the noise from oil drilling could cause noise pollution killing hundreds of whales and dolphins at a time.

4463 2018-05-22 16:15:15 FWIW, I do think the effect of low oil prices on deflationary forces is higher than generally thought.
4464 2018-05-22 16:15:00 How NICE 
Now how about Trump & his admin do some GOOD for the rest of the US citizens like 
REpeal the Tax SCAM 
Provide universal healthcare 
Stop selling our federal lands to the oil boys
Stop being a total liar & be transparent in ALL deals
4465 2018-05-22 16:14:57 Just googled it. Apparently they don't like citrus scents or lavender. Will get some orange or lever oil tomorrow, mix with water and spray that around. See if it works.
4466 2018-05-22 16:14:51 Russia would like to thank Putin's puppet for causing further unrest in the middle east. Very good for Russian oil. #DumpTrump #Treason #Russia #BlueWave
4467 2018-05-22 16:14:50 @dpradhanbjp Oil price breaks all records, Expecting major cut in Excise Duty and States VAT, not in decimal points... otherwise your and your party future in dark @BJP4India @AmitShah @narendramodi @ZeeNews @sudhirchaudhary @republic @TimesNow
4468 2018-05-22 16:14:48 We get 40% oil from Iran. The price of gasoline went up the minute Trump rejected the Iran nuke agreement. Gasoline stations started immediately hiking up the gas prices to make a profit for their own greed. 
4469 2018-05-22 16:14:47 
That's the best argument I've ever seen... you know they way like, its weird how, all fried foods are greasy?! ...its probably the oil?
4470 2018-05-22 16:14:39 He got traq by a rich oil tycoon and now does circus acts all over the world.
4471 2018-05-22 16:14:38 Well, that’s because have the wealthiest oil companies tight here in the good ol’ USA. Go figure.
4472 2018-05-22 16:14:30 Hmmm. Two thoughts, first, what’s the play, other than shorting oil, for eventual collapse of oil prices. Second, how high can prices go given the deflationary forces on other sectors of the economy?
4473 2018-05-22 16:14:28 Funny how the people who are anti trump and comment on our post have very few followers. So yes your right! Fake accounts trolling MAGA accounts.
4474 2018-05-22 16:14:26 Maybe? Probably higher penalties for oil spills & maybe more blocked pipeline plans, but I suspect geopolitics are a bigger part of the picture. My understanding is that the mess in Syria is encouragjng the Saudi govt to keep oil prices low to hurt Iran & Russia, who back Assad.
4475 2018-05-22 16:14:19 After I eat Ima go get my oil changed and wash my car maybe lol my lazy ass just might go back to the hotel and take a nap
4476 2018-05-22 16:14:16 My dad was a Captain in the Merchant Marines. He hauled oil on tankers and goods on Freighters. We saw him for 6 weeks a year. Tough life for my dad and our family. But we were so very proud of him. He also did not get recognized for his part in WW2. He was in danger almost daily
4477 2018-05-22 16:14:16 Alberta already gets its export oil to market.   If local refinery demand is added to the financial picture (which it should be) then Trans Mountain isn't needed for a decade.  By then, there will be no moral excuse to be doubling down on carbon.

4482 2018-05-22 16:13:58 your reply is like saying if we had NO trucks/cars/planes/ships that use oil based fuel and then oil prices would be higher?? clear to anyone this is incorrect as we can all see more cars/trucks/planes/ships use oil more demand and thus price goes up because it has REAL USE CASE

4492 2018-05-22 16:13:18 Turmoil in Venezuela -along with ths other two factors- can cause a temporary hike for dollar vs all currencies since USA is now a swing producer of oil and a Venezuelan supply shock is expected.

4502 2018-05-22 16:12:11 Way safer than a pipeline, and as an added bonus the rail line always follows rivers through the mountains. You know just in case there’s a derailment you’ll still get oil to the coast.

4508 2018-05-22 16:11:54 I don’t get this argument that govt is paying off debts by charging high duties on oil. That’s like giving medicine to patient which will save him from one disease but give another equally bad disease. 
India has enough pulses stock this year, govt has allowed zero duty import.

4510 2018-05-22 16:11:46 Dear Madhavan Sir, I have a question. The crude price was low in NDA regime & Govt imposed much high Excise. at UPA Oil price was so high & it was subsidise. Now it's deregulated. 
Then why we can't able to content CAD 1%-1.5% of GDP? where the extra tax collection going?

4515 2018-05-22 16:11:31 During last four years, Modi has disturbed the budget of the working class, by unconditionally increasing the fuel prices, despite of low price of International crude oil. #AbkiBaar100Paar
4516 2018-05-22 16:11:27 I hope you're successful in #TMX efforts, but it all might have been more feasible if you and Shannon Phillips hadn't spent time in years past demonizing AB's oil industry. In this way you're like the PM, talking out of both sides of mouth
4517 2018-05-22 16:11:27 There are several factors, both economic and political, that can cause fluctuations in oil prices.....but mostly OPEC.......I KNOW you are not that naive so there must be another reason for such a middle school blurtation....

4532 2018-05-22 16:10:07 Easy: the whole planet benefits from being less dependent on oil. Period. The only ones not benefiting are oil Tycoons, Koch brothers et. al. You can question @algore motivations all you want. I still think you are a bit addicted to strange conspiracy theories.

4544 2018-05-22 16:09:12 And yet when government, from federal to local, add more and more regulation to satisfy personal political ideologies regarding the market, businesses and individuals suffer. I've seen that first hand. They destroy entrepreneurialism and the economy.
4545 2018-05-22 16:09:05 “The oil agenda I discovered and experienced was to supply Iraq oil to Israel. The players were the neoconservatives in the Bush Administration, their favorite Iraqi – Dr Ahmed Chalabi and the Israeli government.”
4546 2018-05-22 16:08:56 Situation is not as bad as you propagate..What you do if they
1.Reduce tax by 20% on petroleum  10%margin of oil companies 
2. Allow VDS on 40 % no questions asked. Standard deduction Rs 5 lakh.
3 Reduce GST by 2%...
You  will never be able to remove Dirty Devils Modi  Amit

4553 2018-05-22 16:08:33 People dismiss oil as though it were caviar or gold leaf toilet paper, mere indulgences that we can do without. They neglect to think about the dire consequences of a serious squeeze on oil supply. Supermarket shelves empty, industrial collapse, power cuts. Living in cuckoo land.

4580 2018-05-22 16:06:12 Just the right time for Malaysia. Oil rose to around US$80 a barrel on Tuesday, supported by concern that falling Venezuelan crude output and a potential drop in Iranian exports could further tighten global supply.

4588 2018-05-22 16:05:04 Immature Modi govt thought that they can use low international oil prices to keep making handsome profit from the Indian public.

A true people's govt would have used that revenue for bettering the lives of Indians.

Can BJP answer where has all the profit gone?

"Your car is awesome. Super good. Really impressed with how you're driving it."

But he never does.
4590 2018-05-22 16:04:51 Govt must have to bring petroleum product under GST and control Petroleum Product pricing instead of asking Oil companies to do.

You lie...a lot.
4603 2018-05-22 16:03:55 Suffocating regulations? Regulations maintain fairness in economic exchanges, prevent exploitation of workers, and protect resources, for examples. Are there some bad regulations? Yes. But as a whole, they make the create the environment for a working market.

4694 2018-05-22 15:56:55 The state apparently has no authority to limit either new wells or buffer distance. The recently enacted Kern County Oil Ordinance permitted 3,500+ new well permits annually and reduced buffer distance from 310 down to about 100(?) feet.

4768 2018-05-22 15:50:20 Usually global forces beyond POTUS control drive gas prices, but not this time. Tensions in the Middle East, greatly exacerbated by Trump’s policies, drive oil prices up. Meanwhile, Putin is smiling on the way to the bank, and China rubs its hands in glee.

4845 2018-05-22 15:43:11 Tried the olive oil thing? a tiny amount in the affected ear. then just let it soak in. Might be that you've got compacted wax from the pressure, and that'll break it up. Most temporary ear shit is pretty easily fixed by doctors though.

4886 2018-05-22 15:40:09 With the BJP govt showing no intent of slashing the excise duty on fuel, oil prices are reaching a new peak every day. Govt has no intention of easing the lives of the people, which reflects in its attitude. Lagta hai #AbKiBaar100Paar kar ke rahega Petrol Price

4891 2018-05-22 15:39:53 And yet his policies are improving employment, cutting regulations, and building the morale of this country for millions who were harmed in the previous administrations. I see no evidence that his personality has done that, rather his policies have.

5003 2018-05-22 15:31:34 You don't know that. You are only repeating those people who hate him, including those that used him for money previously (from both parties).

There is a reason they want bullet proof vehicles & desks- it's about OIL- Putin, KSA, UAE- its never been protecting us/environment.

5010 2018-05-22 15:31:21 I’m a 3rd generation Lonshoreman. We see first hand the cyclical nature of commodities. I believe oil is another that will slowly diminish as new and improved renewable energy comes about. We should be focused on being leaders in that.
5011 2018-05-22 15:31:12 Petrol and diesel prices are on the rise owing to the rise in global crude oil prices. But I blame Modi and the threat to the "secular fabric" of the country. #ChurchTargetsModi

2 An average of 100000 Cr debt on all indian oil Mkt companies

5077 2018-05-22 15:27:56 Given the run up in leveraged oil and gas companies, when do they start to raise capital to fix their balance sheets? Higher prices alone will not make these companies sustainably solvent. Most priced for higher prices right now, with no risk of dilutive equity deals.
5078 2018-05-22 15:27:54 How do you pronounce oil?? With or without the I?

5122 2018-05-22 15:23:06 Dave, you never addressed the question. Oil is supplied by other areas of the world at a higher cost to Mother Nature. Your green ideology is dangerous -environmentally and economically. Failure to acknowledge facts just means you are exploiting your constituency.
5123 2018-05-22 15:23:04 @PPTenel13 @radiomitre @diegoleuco  muy buen interrogatorio y la decisión de escarbar a fondo con Quintana.. ahora pueden hacerlo con Cristobal López o alguien de oil combustible?

5125 2018-05-22 15:23:00 In the low-carb echo chamber, pressed oil is whole food but pressed fruit juice isn't. Double standard. #LCHFraud
5126 2018-05-22 15:23:00 They should not even be able to do this. It is shameful, but par for the course of @ScottPruittOK, who is clearly nothing more than a thug shill for big oil and other special interests. #LockHimUp

5129 2018-05-22 15:22:39 Sanctions tend to drive up prices because the sanctioned government's production is not in the market. 
We have increased our own production and the Saudis have agreed to make up the lost production. We are not the only consumers of oil.
5130 2018-05-22 15:22:36 The 'price' of #gold the world follows daily is London/NY paper gold fiction.

#PetroGold will destroy that fiction as 1) it's a physical metal payment system & 2) daily oil production has 20x the value of daily gold prod'n. 'Just give us the metal' destroys paper trade.
5131 2018-05-22 15:22:35 Common man won’t understand all this. In the past governments have fallen due to rising inflation. Global crude oil prices are going to rise in the run up to general elections, so need alternative thinking and drastic measures to ease the pain of common man.

Yes, you were gloating. You really should go back to the Republican Party & take the rest of your center right friends with you. You can support WS, Big Oil, Big Ins & the MIC from there.
5137 2018-05-22 15:21:57 An honest broker is someone able to deal with both sides without bias.

Now clearly we're Israel's ally, but it's time for us to point out to them that our support for them is hurting us and there has to be progress toward a deal.
5138 2018-05-22 15:21:55 Now and again you have to let a little "oil" out.
5139 2018-05-22 15:21:45 It’s only going to get worse with oil reaching higher costs per barrel and Venezuela’s oil industry collapsing

5142 2018-05-22 15:21:42 Why force? It’s like fire and water. They are not meant to be tgt, once tgt, the ending will not be good. Or oil and water, they are immiscible, no matter how wil you mixed it, it will not form a homogeneous soln.

5144 2018-05-22 15:21:24 It’s a clever way to lower obesity rates in this country. Trump doesn’t control the prices of crude oil. He also doesn’t control the distribution and marketing of the gas you are purchasing. Your complaint is pointless and dumb. #chevrolegs #gowalk
5145 2018-05-22 15:21:23 I need to understand this...

1. Will Kenya be exporting her Oil? Refined or Crude?
2. Do we have enough Oil for day to day use?
3. Will the price of fuel go down? By how much?
4. Is the refinery at the coast working?

5147 2018-05-22 15:21:14 @askGST_GoI There should be no applicability of Rule 42/43 for inwards RCM payments. In Industry like Cotton Ginning and Oil Mill, where 100% purchases are based on RCM, reversing 20% (exempt sales) of RCM payment under Rule 42/43 is total loss to the industry. Pecular industry.

5159 2018-05-22 15:20:29 Rising oil prices and the consequential problems is a matter of national concern, on which every one must take a firm stand putting the party politics on the back burner.And, the govt. respecting the vox-populi must maintain the prices at a reasonable level in w/o  excuses.

5179 2018-05-22 15:18:24 Going to Walmart and buy that salt & oil so I can soak . My body hurts
5180 2018-05-22 15:18:24 The full alt is not here yet. But in CO (eg) we regularly hit 20%+ in wind and solar. Let's redirect gov't incentives from fossil to wind /solar/other alts. Tech advances rapidly but market incentives help transition faster. It's counterproductve to tout increased oil production.
5181 2018-05-22 15:18:23 Trump is just following the law that was passed in 1995.
5182 2018-05-22 15:18:22 Honest broker? Every president has recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Only one kept his word as to the move. That's about as honest a broker as it goes, when dealing with Israel and every nation that stands against her. She is, after all, one of our staunchest allies.

5193 2018-05-22 15:17:16 If my skin feels dry and flaky, I use (hear me out) St.Ives Coconut Oil Face scrub, or if I’m in the shower, I add a tinnnny and I mean tiny amount of sugar scrub to my usual dove soap bar.  I’m not looking to scrub my face off, but stimulate my skin and face to regenerate.
5194 2018-05-22 15:17:15 I wish that were true, but considering Saudi is far worse and they seem to be buds, it's doubtful. Follow the $ & oil.
5195 2018-05-22 15:17:10 今度誘ってと伝えておきますw
5196 2018-05-22 15:17:10 Recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital is not a big risk. All other president's paid lip service to the same thing, but never made the physical move. This is a logical fallacy, friend.
5197 2018-05-22 15:17:09 I am just impressed you take fish oil, I have tried, that taste though that lingers all day....
5198 2018-05-22 15:16:52 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for locally produced juice, and put some smoke essential oil in my diffuser.
5199 2018-05-22 15:16:51 Because oil exporters were waiting for elections in India.

5209 2018-05-22 15:16:05 The Pouting Pundits of Pessimism are rarely right, but always certain of themselves.  Remember “Peak Oil”?  In 2014, proven U.S. oil reserves were 36.4 billion barrels - a 90% increase from 2008. EIA estimates an additional 198 billion are undiscovered - another 933% increase.

5217 2018-05-22 15:15:29 Your Tyee conspiracy theory confirms oil, like mining, forestry and agriculture are successful industries in a capitalist system, providing jobs and taxes. Exports also confirm global demand, which is increasing. You and your friends are part of that demand.

5274 2018-05-22 15:11:23 I’m watching Netflix on my phone while I get an oil change, and all of a sudden the sound stops playing because my phone had connected to my car’s Bluetooth 
5275 2018-05-22 15:11:15 kalau oil kenapa? saja tanya
5276 2018-05-22 15:11:12 Ahh yes... I forgot that getting Canada's oil to market doesn't benefit the entire country? The pipeline would have minimal environmental impact yet be a true boon for our national economy.
5277 2018-05-22 15:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: undercooked crust with damp motor oil and shrimp.
5278 2018-05-22 15:11:02 No, no, no. The correct term is bitumen. Tar sands was named by the opponents to create negative branding. Bitumen is a type of oil and tar is a derivative of coal. Get your facts straight. Once again I’m happy to walk you through the facts and chemistry.
5279 2018-05-22 15:11:02 The members pay for the gun manufacturers lobby? Do you drive a car? I’m sure the Gas and Oil Lobby would like you to fund them as well.

5282 2018-05-22 15:10:52 You'd think these eventualities could be engineered into systems where they know there's risk.  In 1990 we nearly had big oil spill with Redoubt Volcano (Alaska) eruption, pyroclastics / lahars flooding Drift River oil tank storage facility.  Were lucky but could have been bad.
5283 2018-05-22 15:10:48 How much of that is Oil Charlie?
5284 2018-05-22 15:10:47 @PepsiCo continues to buy unsustainable palm oil, destroying precious tiger habitats! #boycottpepsi #pepsi #tigers #rainforest
5285 2018-05-22 15:10:43 today oil has improved in the international market, even with the subsidy, which is above GEJ's own, we still buy fuel at #145. ,is that not scam enough?
5286 2018-05-22 15:10:36 Yay!  We hope you love this oil! Thank you for sharing!
5287 2018-05-22 15:10:32 I tried it with a rosehip oil under but as you said, its then sheer, BUT I've just put the tiniest bit of vaseline on the side of my jaw and blended the foundation over and it's sitting really nice? (I think bc of the oil/stickyness) I'm gonna try that full face tomorrow
5288 2018-05-22 15:10:31 I  waiting till oil stops propping everything up.
5289 2018-05-22 15:10:27 Why don't we stop subsidizing the oil industry. They show record profits year after year. There's your money, honey
5290 2018-05-22 15:10:27 While rising oil prices raised concern all over the world including oil producing countries, Lebanon hired the two Turkish power generating ships for 3 additional years showing no worry whatsoever abt the cost of fuel the 2 ships will be consuming at the  expense of deficient EDL
5291 2018-05-22 15:10:25 the same thing that turns on not allowing snake oil salesmen to call themselves doctors.

5300 2018-05-22 15:09:36 @Nordea: A multitude of factors has helped push the oil price higher. The rise is set to continue in the coming months, but prices will probably fall  again towards the end of the year. The macroeconomic effects of the  higher prices should not be overplayed. #brentoil #fx #oil
5301 2018-05-22 15:09:31 Definitely nuclear war over mideast oil. The Middle East, India and China will get all the fallout. Their populations are too large anyway.

5324 2018-05-22 15:07:12 Congress is only opposing BJP policy but not assuring public that they will reduce oil prices,will raise income tax ceiling if come to power

5341 2018-05-22 15:05:16 Of course oil is an international commodity. Doesn't mean that the same amount of taxes get levied in every country. The point of the tweet was - we are already poor. On top of that, these taxes mean our cost of fuel is actually much higher than other countries.
5342 2018-05-22 15:04:51 ప్రతి వాడు petrole rate తగ్గించండి అనే వాడే కాని petrol వాడకం తగ్గించండి అనే వాడు లేడు......

5345 2018-05-22 15:04:40 Ya, profoundly honoured to spy on the people your swore to protect and advanced vital mission to kill people in third world countires that are trying to feel themselves from dictatorships so you can continue to get oil at a low price.
5346 2018-05-22 15:04:38 Price control of petrol and diesel resting with the oil companies has made it difficult for the common people to affort.Why not look at it in the larger interest of  consumers and economy concerns, therefore the Petroleum Ministry should take its hold again.

5358 2018-05-22 15:03:44 4tbs coconut oil + 1/4 cup baking soda + 1/4 cup cornstarch + essential oil of your choice makes a month’s supply or more and lasts all day. I’ve been using it year-round for ten years and swear by it.
5359 2018-05-22 15:03:34 sach kah raha hai? international crude prices r increasing as per oil cos! some thing is seriously wrong somewhere

May 2018 - Crude oil price $72.44

5363 2018-05-22 15:03:18 My everything hates coconut oil. My scalp so friggin choosy. And I gave the Haitian black castor oil a go and I haven't seen a flake in so long. It has a really earthy scent but it usually goes away. Everything else made my scalp flare right up.
5364 2018-05-22 15:03:07 Tax cuts well into a growing economy + Isolationist policy + Stirring global instability = Inflation compounded by spiking fuel prices

Net/net, your tax breaks are absorbed by all the players that are too rich already (oil industry, banks, Russia)

5383 2018-05-22 15:01:21 crude oil is 80$ .. in 2012 it was 100$ .. how it is 40% less .. also do you know subsidies was 100% more as now it is 0% ... but still i feel bad about free thinking hair free person , no subsidy can bring his hair back ..

5397 2018-05-22 15:00:20 Grapeseed oil is life for my face while BHA is a life saver 
5398 2018-05-22 15:00:16 hrmmm. my scalp and skin hate product in general. the most i can do is coconut oil and then wash it out, or else i get the itchy flakes and then sideburn acne from my locs touching my face. i wanna try castor oil tho..im allergic to almond oil >_<
5399 2018-05-22 15:00:08 Fool. They promised to buy our oil, but they won’t.
5400 2018-05-22 15:00:06 My point exactly!! It's about the oil! It's about pipelines!!

5410 2018-05-22 14:59:53 Right, but last time gas was that high oil was at like 120$/barrel in 08-10...
5411 2018-05-22 14:59:50 Agree. UK not quite as bad yet as US but we’re going that way. Eg some US “environmental” think tanks are straight up climate change denying lobby ops for oil companies. Once this happens idea of expertise totally debauched. Hence things like #brexit

5414 2018-05-22 14:59:30 Why is it taking those oil barons so long to trickle down that huge tax break you gave them to us consumers?
5415 2018-05-22 14:59:25 It reminds me of the early-2014 ‘truth’ that “oil can never be less than $100 ever again”
5416 2018-05-22 14:59:21 As on date the prices of Petrol & diesel compairing with the crude oil prices in international market Government look like a group of jokers #Pakodanomics #TheLieLama #APDharmaPoratam

5422 2018-05-22 14:58:49 BP told staff meeting today that it will cut 540 of 18,000 oil and gas production jobs. 

It won't say where cuts happening, but has around 1,500 staff working in North Sea, so stands to reason some of those will be in UK

5437 2018-05-22 14:57:40 3.  Funny thing happened about a year ago.  An article appeared on the internet about this same guy, he is living in Florida and he still has that car and it is still going strong.  This is how ideas are suppressed.  Big oil companies did not want his invention to get out.

5451 2018-05-22 14:56:45 Cannabis was made illegal so that DuPont would make more money off their oil and paper patents and it was done by stoking racial hatred towards minorities. It shows that conservatives have been using the same game plan for hundreds of years.

5509 2018-05-22 14:52:36 2003 Crude Oil Price $28.1 per Barrel Petrol Rs.29/- per ltre
May 2014 - Crude Oil Price $108  per Barrel. Petrol Price Rs.71.41 per litre
Today Crude oil price$72.50 Petrol price in Mumbai today Rs.84.70 per litre
Any justification???
5510 2018-05-22 14:52:34 Russia's thanking Trump for this, I'm sure. Trump's push against renewable & into old energy has lifted prices! Also, prices can be lifted by gaming the surplus. Also prices of oil can go up if there's inflation in the USD since oil's traded in $$. So Trump has been a big help!
5511 2018-05-22 14:52:32 hey but it's a lot better than oil. Imagine when ICE was first invented & we thought to ourselves everyone will have ICE car & we are going to dig oil out of the ground to burn it in the ICE. That thought would be totally insane yet that's what we did. LIB r fine for next 15 yrs.
5512 2018-05-22 14:52:18 The oil industry coined the term tar sands.  Oil sands is an attempt at rebranding.  I'm happy to go on a tour of the tar sands--any time.
5513 2018-05-22 14:52:14 Partly because of the type of product extracted from fracking can't be used by some energy users and also because the other producers are deathly afraid of allowing the USA to dominate the oil markets.
5514 2018-05-22 14:52:12 Brent crude's long term resistance is at $86 a barrel. And, Saudi Aramco IPO is estimated to come in Q4 2018. The link between them is quite visible but technical factors will hit oil prices very soon. So, looks like all good news are factored rather quickly at around $86.

5519 2018-05-22 14:51:42 It is absolutely amazing to listen to Govt logic that international Oil cost going up so our prices , some minister even brought out  Iran , US bla bla . They quietly suppress the fact that almost three times more tax revenue squeezed out from public compared to pre 2014

5534 2018-05-22 14:51:03 Funny I thought it was the Clintons and had major ties to the Russians? Bill got a half $1 million for giving his speech. Hillary negotiated away 20% of our oil reserves
5535 2018-05-22 14:51:01 These oil giants are loving these gas prices.   The Saudis, Putin and UAE have received one hell of a return of their investment.

5539 2018-05-22 14:50:42 I'm expecting a stern editorial from @theJaggi in @SwarajyaMag  decrying the political populism of reducing taxes on petrol: "High tax reduces demand for expensive imported oil; it impacts only the rich; and it's good for the nation's finances even if some people pay more"

5556 2018-05-22 14:49:03 cant imagine who has the funds to buy up so many oil contracts week after week after week, while ignoring risk averse behavior - very curious how June trading will play out now because previous 8 of 10 May>>June have seen trend reversal
5557 2018-05-22 14:48:59 First Total,  French oil giant, now BP.
5558 2018-05-22 14:48:59 The 3rd World has slowly placed a foot in Europe and it will become an unrecoverable scourge in a very short period of time.  Oil and water do not mix and one will eventually replace the other.
5559 2018-05-22 14:48:51 Wow, that is impressive! I pale in comparison, oil painter, recently taught myself to crochet and I do Krav Maga twice a week. I make a shit ton of gold no matter which RPG game I play and my moral compass is mostly north too. I don't think anyone is true north, but there's hope.
5560 2018-05-22 14:48:32 Good stuff!  But where will church leaders find artisan beard oil and tenderly crafted cold brew coffee?  
5561 2018-05-22 14:48:29 You need asains. Look at nurses doctors. Only Britain was Great when it   had India imperialism  or asains. The jewel in the crown is what u robbed from asia. You got no oil. No gem stones. A million no 3 4 million benefit scroungers benefiting from Muslim taxes.

5573 2018-05-22 14:46:50 Has anyone written a piece noting the parallel between:
1) The PATH Act being paired with the repeal of the oil export ban

5574 2018-05-22 14:46:48 And if they drop 1 speck of oil the rest of the world will sue America 4 all it's worth.
5575 2018-05-22 14:46:32 How is NK leading him around?

3 hostages released and the only thing we promised in return was heavier sanctions!! 

Trump led the UN in voting 15-0 for harsh sanctions, including 90% of oil imports.  

Kim can deal or not with Trump, but we have the upper hand.

5588 2018-05-22 14:45:14 Jokes on oil pricing going down.
5589 2018-05-22 14:45:03 Why is the oil companies regulated the hard working people can't afford to live it's either food on the table or gas to get to work on and the answer no food have to work to pay the high cost of living . I'm your number 1 supporter but this dam country is skrewed up.

5594 2018-05-22 14:44:30 에!!!!!!!!
5595 2018-05-22 14:44:28 Its mainly bcz of low crude prices in the last 4yrs and govt collected massive revenue thro high domestic oil prices..nothing great to be proud of
5596 2018-05-22 14:44:27 Is that why they're desperate to frack, even under National Parks? Reason is England needs oil but doesn't have enough w/o Scotland's input. #indyref2

5602 2018-05-22 14:44:05 ออกมาตี้
5603 2018-05-22 14:44:05 I agree...bt I remember when these companies used to be under tremendous loss n govt used to say we cannot lower the price as oil companies are losing.nw they are already in profit,I agree due to other ventures as well,y not act as now they aren’t bearing losses. That is my point

5612 2018-05-22 14:43:34 The hike in petrol & diesel prices is due to global increase in crude oil prices. Gov. is not responsible for it. Opposition is misleading the people. However gov. should consider reducing taxes & thus burden on people will be eased.

5613 2018-05-22 14:43:32 No no no..
Price of crude is absolutely irrelevant...

As per modinomics bhaktology everything that happens post 2014 is justified and right. 

Everything before was corrupted, mismanaged and anti national.

BTW. Oil companies import oil and are responsible for paying Iran.

5666 2018-05-22 14:38:50 They won’t need out oil and gas as England will be awash with the stuff once fracking gets going.
5667 2018-05-22 14:38:36 of course! the good genes is like a serum so you definitely have to put moisturiser afterwards. and the other one is an oil. you dont need to use a lot of drops, i use about 3. it will hydrate but you defs should use a moisturiser. you should always moisturise!!
5668 2018-05-22 14:38:36 A lovely racer
5669 2018-05-22 14:38:35 @TheRickHoweShow pick some dandilions on land that was not pesticided.  add oil and vinegar, what a great salad.  .
5670 2018-05-22 14:38:32 My bosses are doing low-carb diets and rave about putting coconut oil in their coffee. I tried it today and now I’m looking up other uses 
5671 2018-05-22 14:38:28 What does socialism do to a country? If you look at Norway (praised by Trump, BTW) they have the highest standard of living, in health, education, infrastructure very low crime Lot of innovation in oil industry. Sweden also has very successful companies: Spotify, H&M, AstraZeneca

5674 2018-05-22 14:38:25 Interesting. But the article goes without mention of the USA as an oil exporting powerhouse. A reality opposite the one Nixon faced.
5675 2018-05-22 14:38:18 One Democrat complains about Gas Prices.
Another Democrat complains about Drilling for Oil offshore.

USA can be Energy Independent and Drive Prices Down.

What kind of M O R O N S did we elect to run our Government anyway?

5676 2018-05-22 14:38:16 Opec, Russia + friends cut oil supply by more than 2.5m b/d in April, as compliance with their agreed targets approached 150%.

That's a bigger cut than was agreed in the depths of the financial crisis (-2.2m b/d), when demand was collapsing.

5680 2018-05-22 14:37:57 And the oil price is going up; more political bias Mr Neil?????????????????
5681 2018-05-22 14:37:56 This is a lackluster piece filled with errors. CAFE standards may impact future demand. And it was under Obama that crude oil exports became fair game, and mentioning Iran without mentioning OPEC or Venezuela as the largest factors? Piece lacks merit.
5682 2018-05-22 14:37:54 Just move to Houston! Start working in Oil and Gas downtown.

5684 2018-05-22 14:37:45 Oil is internationally traded commodity. Labor cost is not a % of price. There is no reason why oil should be cheaper in India.
5685 2018-05-22 14:37:40 Who called zanu pf and ED dinosaurs? The rest of the world is moving towards clean energy and we proudly announcing an inefficient, environmentally unfriendly, last century conversion of coal to oil deal that will take as back instead of forwards

5695 2018-05-22 14:37:08 Give these all up because the treats posed to the racist apartheid state of Isreal. Oh! I forgot... Your oil is mine.
5696 2018-05-22 14:37:04 @BJP4India Govt should think of getting Oil companies under Govt control for price change (like it was before) otherwise they keep changing price crazily
5697 2018-05-22 14:36:54 The only non-mechanical part is a portion of its face. Only eats raw meat soaked in machine oil.
5698 2018-05-22 14:36:51 We are now in a position that any action or inaction will lead to somebody taking a hit - the consumer (price rise), the oil companies (if put in the old position) and/or the government (if subsidy offered). The eventual loser is again the consumer, in any case. 3/n
5699 2018-05-22 14:36:50 Had a customer bring his V6 Camaro in, throwing a bunch of misfire codes (low on oil and super overdue for a service), and I said “well here’s your problem pal, you’re missing two cylinders”

5703 2018-05-22 14:36:22 Why do you continue with the term tar sands? And have you ever thought to visit the oil sands? Or take the time to learn anything g original - rather that just spout the rhetoric you are fed by Tides and such. It’s in Canada’s interest that we learn the facts...

5722 2018-05-22 14:34:25 India imports crude oil from these countries.
Saudi Arabia: 19.9%
Iraq: 16.2%
Iran: 11%
Nigeria: 10.9%
United Arab Emirates: 9.3
Venezuela: 8.3%

Why not trade in INR with them, as they need from pepper to jackfruit, rice,sugar,wheat and more from us.
5723 2018-05-22 14:34:22 Oil price was kept deliberately low to bleed Russia. But Russia adjusted its economy by heavily depreciating its currency. India should be ready for high Oil price in coming years. In comparison to prices around world Current Petrol price in India is at average level.
5724 2018-05-22 14:34:19 Opening up and reducing the amount of national parks so that oil and mining  companies can ruin the land for profits when better cheaper energy alternatives are available only benefits the oil companies and lines trump’s and the GOPs pockets

5727 2018-05-22 14:34:13 In my opinion Canada is not doing #enough to combat climate change.  A big step forward we can make is to end the development of oil sands in Alberta which are extremely unsustainable.  Tar sands produce 8x pollution than conventional oil production.

5741 2018-05-22 14:33:33 You miss the point completely. The point is petrol price linked to crude oil and has risen much more in UPA times than NDA time so why are some Congi ignoramuses complaining about NDA?? Any iota of sense and logic left in them?

5743 2018-05-22 14:33:12 Oh man. We urgently need stability in ME.

This is why trump pulled out of Iran deal. Iran pumping in crude oil is what brought the prices down. And reversing it raises prices helping Gulf friends.

5752 2018-05-22 14:32:29 That's not true, your obsession with Trump forces you to attack anyone who criticizes him and anyone who tells the truth as opposed to spreading conservative lies. They don't want you to believe in climate change so they can sell more oil, they're greedy.

5772 2018-05-22 14:30:56 Gas prices have almost nothing to do with the president. I think we all know this. Oil by its nature is cyclical and moves from cheap to expensive to cheap.

5776 2018-05-22 14:30:51 Iranian vessels turned the transponders off and swapped oil with UAE vessels when there was an embargo. If there is an oil supply crunch, Iranian oil will be bought one way or the other.

5801 2018-05-22 14:29:37 My take today:

China militarization can only be stop by US and ASEAN united assertion in the region.

Oil price hike/spike is only a beginning of development. Read Economics 101. Dont ever believe in the (tatalino the hell) interviewee.

5805 2018-05-22 14:29:13 Oil price does not depend on minimum wage. Anything that is largely automated does not depend on minimum wage. Some things will get affected - services for example - but oil and automated stuff will not. Sounds reasonable?
5806 2018-05-22 14:28:49 Brought my car in for an oil change and the mechanic is really trying to tell me my car smells like weed when I don't smoke weed

5813 2018-05-22 14:28:07 @JoeNBC Not surprised that so many in the GOP don't care about the Russians; They have already sold out their values to ALEX, our planet to Big Oil, and our children to the NRA -- why would they care if a few Russian oligarchs pay their bills?

5817 2018-05-22 14:27:55 Like the Oil & Gas Authority ( and so many oil companies operating in the Scottish North Sea ) - the IRANIAN OIL COMPANY (U.K.) LIMITED, is registered and taxed in England & Wales.
5818 2018-05-22 14:27:53 As long as there’s no white grains or salty spices, I think it’s ok. Like if you wanted to use mrs dash on them and cook it in a skillet with a bit of olive oil, it’d be fine. That’s how I’m gonna do mine
5819 2018-05-22 14:27:49 BS...why isn’t GP calling for rebuilding salmon stocks for SRKWs to eat..? GP doesn’t give a toss about orcas they are just another excuse to use against oil
5820 2018-05-22 14:27:45 This isn't about saving $. This is about conditioning you to work more and more and accept less for your labor. Ask yourself this, Why do oil companies tell you how horrible business is and at the end of a quarter post profits in the billions? Are they accepting less?
5821 2018-05-22 14:27:37 Ugh! #Artistproblems: When you accidentally mix acrylic paint into your oil paint and don't notice it until you apply it to your canvas. Now I have a huge flaky image that i need to strip & re-do. And big waste of paint.
5822 2018-05-22 14:27:31 No surprise, but @BP_plc announced it is suspending work at its North Sea #Rhum gas field where #NIOC has a 50% stake via its subsidiary Iranian Oil Company. The field reportedly produces about 5% of UK's #gas.
5823 2018-05-22 14:27:25 The EU would be interested IF the oil revenues make it worthwhile. But SNP haven't said what would happen if EU were to take over. The SNP hoped that becoming Independent whilst still in the EU would mean an easy transition to full membership. Brexit means starting from scratch.

5826 2018-05-22 14:27:16 43% of the American people cannot afford their monthly expenses.  The oil companies will now grab their last dime. trump will destroy the economy while lining his pockets.
5827 2018-05-22 14:27:15 So how would we be better without the extra FT that covers our large deficit?  Won't we have to raise taxes or cut services?  Or is the SNP going to reveal where those secret oil fields are?

5830 2018-05-22 14:26:47 I hold a similar opinion, bro. The oil companies had been bearing the brunt of the Govt. subsidies for long. There was a rant that NDA hasn’t reduced the prices in spite of the global prices going down. One should have anticipated that they were surely going to be up again 1/n
5831 2018-05-22 14:26:45 Stop using Citgo gas when you fill up. That's an easy solution any of us can do. I know it's always a few cents cheaper but don't support Venezuelan oil in this simple way.

5853 2018-05-22 14:24:19 The DG of DMO, according to @SaharaReporters, says that without borrowing, the Fed. govt cannot deliver the 2018 budget. 

Difficult to believe in the face to d current price of crude oil (as at today) of $80 per barrel? Without mad borrowing, d 1999 budget was financing with $9.

5871 2018-05-22 14:22:57 cool so, bought the fenty foundation, colour is perfect but this foundation WILL NOT sit on my skin. I applied once with a light primer- it seperates and looks dry, tried again after exfoliating lighting and using a moisturiser and rose hip oil, looked natural until blending out.
5872 2018-05-22 14:22:55 Ok, but here's what I don't get... Mayo is just egg whites and oil, right? Ice cream is a flavoring, milk, eggs and sugar... Depending on the oil you use, how would you even know it wasn't just vanilla ice cream?

5937 2018-05-22 14:16:29 Have you ever been there? For Mac has gorgeous scenery too. All oilsands mines are completely recovered to boreal forest after completion. The difference being the land is better since the oil is no longer there. Take a trip & see for yourself.

5942 2018-05-22 14:15:58 There are 3 gas/oil power plants about to go operational in the Hudson Valley in the next year that have a shelf life of between 20-30 years. These plants are not replacing any high GHG power plants they will strictly be adding GHG, carcinogens, methane, ammonia(x3)to C- air.
5943 2018-05-22 14:15:44 Odd How you go on about oil rich countries but yet when the words oil and Scotland appear in the same sentence then it becomes a bad thing to have according to the yoons.
5944 2018-05-22 14:15:40 And refiners are profiting off the WTI to Brent spread,  selling gasoline at global prices while buying domestic oil a discounts to WTI, I've heard there could be as much as $20 bbl discount for Permian oil to WTI

5969 2018-05-22 14:13:49 Who are you trying to fool?

Alberta charges 1% royalty on oil revenue, meaning the Texas oil corporations get 99% of the revenue (the important part).

5980 2018-05-22 14:12:33 ISIS took land from Assad, does that mean they're allowed to keep it? He obviously requires the oil fields in Deir Ezzor to start rebuilding the country but the US doesn't care for Syrian, they rushed for those fields compromising Raqqa liberation for leverage against Assad.

5983 2018-05-22 14:12:23 I wouldn't say it's a fake poll per se. There are only about 3000 votes, so it could easily go either way. It's just a matter of which side gets it out to the most people.

6031 2018-05-22 14:07:37 FYI, fuel prices are going to spike. This is a result of a lack of investing in the drilling of new oil wells from 2014-mid 2017.  Now there's production shortfalls that will raise the price of oil, subsequently raising the price of gas.
6032 2018-05-22 14:07:27 Mr. @dpradhanbjp sir ... What's the outcome of your meeting with oil companies?? Any benefit to the people of India .... Or just some media coverage for you?? 9 hikes in 9 days .... What's happening in the country sir ??

6034 2018-05-22 14:07:19 Consider: The high price of gas (and oil) is due to a manipulated foreign affairs crisis. Oil producers have been suffering thanks to low prices. A return to high prices mean they go back to drill-baby-drill. In this one case, high gas price leads to more production.
6035 2018-05-22 14:07:17 I don't know about the tank sealants,  but the biodiesel ingredients are the frying oil. Which can be used to make biofuel all by itself.  That's not really the health problem in the food,  it's all the sugar/carbs/processed that is in there

6069 2018-05-22 14:04:19 Trade wars are easy: China won. The $US basis for oil has been permanently ratcheted up vs. other currencies & will continue to exacerbate as more countries move their purchase basis for oil away from $US reference as well.

Quietly, China gutted Trump like a fish 12 weeks ago.
6070 2018-05-22 14:03:57 the awareness of the disastrous situation if the gulf countries remain dependent on oil have made the new trend

6072 2018-05-22 14:03:44 If South Africa needs proof that nationalizing its natural resources will not redistribute wealth, look to Venezuela. With more oil than sense, 5000 desperate people are leaving the country daily looking for work, food, medicine. Nobody cares that fuel is R0,10 per liter, Maduro
6073 2018-05-22 14:03:39 Atkinson: in @IEA forecast, China net crude #oil imports double the US in 2023. Indian imports, too, surpass the US in 2023 as shale growth reduces US import dependence.
6074 2018-05-22 14:03:30 I’m seeing all over Facebook now dealing with oil and gas prices going up and people complaining thst because it’s summer they are price gouging... knowing it’s because we are all going to be driving.. don’t these people know what Supply and Demand is?

6090 2018-05-22 14:02:29 @SenatorCarper Saudi Arabia paid Trump $1B. Hence Trump withdrew from Iran nuclear program agreement it will increase crude oil price. We have to pay more. Saudi Arabia which attacked World Trade Center will benefit also
6091 2018-05-22 14:02:24 Singapore per capita income is what 7/8 times India's? So oil is 1/4th as cheap to them. The tweet is saying that our taxes are too high or else oil would have been cheaper to us as well. Of course higher income would help, but hard to see how we can deny that as well!
6092 2018-05-22 14:02:24 We are importing the finished product  too here in Nigeria like non oil producing country that's why, and the price is not determine by us the price is determine by international marketing standard,as long as we wil not refined for our local consumption the price wil cont 2 hike

6104 2018-05-22 14:01:44 Yes, if you haven't notice there is political corruption everywhere, especially here. The main current problem is $50-70 oil & a US government sanctioning the economy, while trying to capsize Maduro to bring in the Right wing & impose the Washington Consensus.

6115 2018-05-22 14:00:16 And when Obama convinced the Saudis to pump more oil, it went down to 40.  And poor little Putin had a big sad, because Russia's budget was calculated at 100 a barrel.....

A source of crude oil, according to the internet.
6122 2018-05-22 13:59:56 It's been talked about for the last couple of years. Private oil sector was going to do it in 2015, I think.

6125 2018-05-22 13:59:32 Don’t be surprised, if Trump puts an end to the artificially high oil prices.
We will increase oil production, and possibly even a strategic oil reserve release..
6126 2018-05-22 13:59:29 Ironically, 75 a barrel is also the breakeven price for that Keystone pipeline.... Imagine that.  And now Iran is pumping oil at 4 MBPD.  Hmmmmm.... we can't allow that to continue now, can we?

6129 2018-05-22 13:59:21 Just because he’s acting on his campaign doesn’t make him a good person. Especially if doing so is only to line his & his friends pockets. Oil prices up help Russia, negative policy to Qatar helps UAE. Threatening sanctions on allies... Trump is the swamp...

6132 2018-05-22 13:59:13 Fuel prices depend on crude oil prices, the rupee $ exchange rate and local taxes. Both crude oil prices and $ are higher and govt has limited control on that. Hence the govt should lower the very high existing taxes on petrol and diesel....

6135 2018-05-22 13:59:05 Ground campaign was peripheral, but air campaign and sea blockade were not; affected food, oil, weapons production. Also, Nazis had to take aircraft from Eastern Theater to defend German airspace. Hitler kept 400,000 troops stranded in Norway thinking allies would invade (again).

6149 2018-05-22 13:58:01 would have appreciated if 2012 govt would have paid all fuel debts during their time, which is affecting more than the rise crude oil price rise of their time.
6150 2018-05-22 13:58:01 The global increase in oil prices is the main factor, on the top of the abuse by the local providers. Cutting the margin by 1 DH will make a significant impact on the whole economy.

6153 2018-05-22 13:57:41 Oil trades within a range for the foreseeable future. Price goes up, shale, tar and sand oils become economically profitable and production ramps up. Increased supply pushes prices back down. Just short term spike while production lags.
6154 2018-05-22 13:57:39 Atkinson: Higher oil prices unleash second wave of US supply. Total US output reaches 17 mb/d by 2023 – and could be even higher if prices rise/bottlenecks ease.
6155 2018-05-22 13:57:36 So from where the govt would get the extra money if the lose income from oil??? It can't be done at one shot ....
6156 2018-05-22 13:57:32 But Cheny/Halliburton needed the price of oil to go up over 75 a barrel in order to economically justify fracking...... why didn't we just buy the oil at 20 a barrel?

6176 2018-05-22 13:55:31 It's clear to see a lot of global changes came from this time, and from the energy issues of that time.

6186 2018-05-22 13:55:11 They don’t have to stop using oil, they just have to stop selling it for US Dollars. China is letting their US bonds mature, not continuing to buy. When the treasury can’t sell its debt to float this new massive budget deficit, the fed will print USD.

6196 2018-05-22 13:54:11 Right now, we're in the 11th largest oil spike in the last 70 years, according to UBS.

You might not be noticing it because world oil energy intensity in developed world has dropped by 51% since 1965.

Mody should show his 56 inches to OPEC and in collusion with Japan, China and Brazil force them to reduce prices to the level of 45 dollars a barrel! 
This will leave these countries with less cash and smother their funding to terrorism too!

6363 2018-05-22 13:39:01 There is no win-win in China trade deal with America. China is agreeing to get stuff that they know will trigger inflation in America and deplete a strategic resource such as oil and natural gas. If anything, energy exports to China should be prohibited on Nat Sec grounds.

6403 2018-05-22 13:35:00 OPEC production cuts, US exit from its nuclear deal with Iran, declining domestic oil inventories and strong demand are some factors that have driven up oil prices, 
Oil prices up=higher gas costs, #GasPrices #oilandgas
6404 2018-05-22 13:34:57 I ordered some Winco since it seemed that’s what Amazon had (tho the product I got says Winware on the cardboard). They didn’t come with caps. I’m assuming if I put cooking oil in these, the hole should be covered, maybe even airtight sealed.
6405 2018-05-22 13:34:54 Surprising how quick forecourt prices go up when oil increases yet when oil goes down ... Apparently oil companies make a loss at the pump. Oh dear, let's make a charity record.

I expect Modiji to seriously to take stand, I doubt he is not ruling us, someelse.
6414 2018-05-22 13:33:15 He always said the U.S. should of gotten Iran's oil so he's purposely sending oil prices up to start a war.  All about corruption and money.

6449 2018-05-22 13:30:25 Are you seriously using a two year news article to try and make a point?
You ARE aware that oil is heading for $100 a barrel again and recoverable oil is between 11 and 20 billion barrels with production lasting until at least 2050.

But Scotland doesn't need oil to independent.

6468 2018-05-22 13:29:26 Si fuera x eso el shale oil americano no podría competir (tiene un costo de cerca de 50 dólares/barril) y el petróleo no está en 100 hace más de cinco años. Recién logro subir a 70 en los últimos meses. Van 4 años de menos de 40 dólares promedio. Obvio eso golpea aún más a maduro

6518 2018-05-22 13:24:24 For that to happen the FIA needs to issue a new TD or the clarification is enough to stop Ferrari from abusing a grey area ?

6526 2018-05-22 13:23:38 Irrelevant to #AAOG ‘s past they have one of the best MCAP to net barrels target. Only #CHAR has a larger disparity IMO

However murky a companies past there’s a potential trade here. Highly likely R1/R2 strikes oil & is expected to produce oil.
6527 2018-05-22 13:23:34 And nobody cares that crude oil back in 2014 was $107 per barrel and now it is $71..

You benefit from the oil war and you were ok with bush concealing the truth then? @RexTillersom @realDonaldTrump stop trump hating.
6609 2018-05-22 13:14:48 and pumped money into oil industry while neglecting these other industries that Venezuela had. Drought caused problems generating electricity in 2015, meanwhile while low oil prices killed capital intensive oil production in Orinoco Belt. Combine that with kleptocracy...

6614 2018-05-22 13:14:37 During manmohan's tenure as pm, the crude oil prices were 150 per barrel in doler. Now during modi's tenure the crude oil prices are at 65 ?
6615 2018-05-22 13:14:36 yeah? Takes me a lot less time. Took me a few minutes to decide on placement for the oil paintings in my room. And similar time for the notice boards.

6620 2018-05-22 13:14:17 PR folks - lobbyists - have open agendas - on all sides of debate. When Tides & Suzuki foundations work in secret ways - only discovered by #VivianKrause’s diligence - the treason is exposed. 

Now back to facts - US oil production has gone from 3 to 10 MBPD in a decade. All Ok?
6621 2018-05-22 13:14:12 @EricTrump Hi  Mueller is coming to investigate how your Dad Idiot selfish withdrew from IRAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM to increase CRUDE OIL PRICE to help SAUDI ARABIA since they paid $1B to You.

6628 2018-05-22 13:13:48 It is just you because that's completely false. You can't go below the price of production you can only adjust your profit margins. And that only goes so far. If you introduce extra cost for production such as more expensive oil prices go up for everything.

6639 2018-05-22 13:13:07 So I've been hearing a lot about CBD oils recently. Can anyone rate them and maybe point me to some cheap ones? I suffer from serious leg pain and back pain and I'm actually kinda scared of all that walking around at CFz, but the oil so expensive ;w;
6640 2018-05-22 13:13:04 Price of.petrol was around sixty rupees when the international price of.crude oil was.$140/or so.per barrel. Present price around$77. Public are unable to.understand the paradox. Centre shd take serious view.and take suitable.action to bring down the price

6651 2018-05-22 13:12:05 This oil prices are manipulative increase by the opec countries and Russia bcz Saudi Aramco ipo gets more valuations of his share. 
And I know many country's are only dependent on oil that's y last year  vanajualla crisis occurs. 
My problem is y Modi increases excise duty

6655 2018-05-22 13:11:57 Let's address the problem of rising sea levels by all agreeing to stop dropping rocks into the ocean. They are difficult to retrieve and often come out covered with oil and sticky tar that makes the plastic garbage hard to remove. So no more rocks and everything will be fine!

6695 2018-05-22 13:08:32 Using premium plant oils to remove makeup is cost effective & nourishing for the skin. Most commercial makeup removers have too much alcohol or other drying ingredients messing with skin's natural oil. Use coconut oil, sweet almond oil, avocado oil etc. to wipe off makeup.

6700 2018-05-22 13:08:17 Uneducated fake degree leaders are responsible for this price hike. Even though the crude  oil price has decreased to 68 dollars these uneducated incompetent fools increased the oil be prices.

6706 2018-05-22 13:07:56 I’m really fond of “lepips” about 24”, with a slight knob at the end (e.g. my shovel end).  Linseed oil makes them both a bit heavier, and more resonant/resilient.

It’s also much better in court to use a stick than a gun.

6726 2018-05-22 13:05:55 Oil is what grants the UK such generous interest rates, because they currently have a desirable resource that can act as collateral. Once we leave and take it with us, the interest rates for the pound are going to spike.
6727 2018-05-22 13:05:51 Brent is always higher since the oil in North Sea is costly process. Nymex is the correct measure.Europe is generally on Brent.Trump and his new fond freind in Saudi are making $$$$??

6754 2018-05-22 13:03:17 @latha_venkatesh
I will never bring down Oil Prices in the time being.
It is my decision.
6755 2018-05-22 13:03:12 A million things to do before I can leave tomorrow....oil changed , photo edits, shoot this afternoon , and the list goes on.....oh yeah pack !!! Breath Joann.  Yes I am talking to myself :-)
6756 2018-05-22 13:03:08 It's like changing your oil in your car.  It's recommended, you can push it a little, but too much and you'll have regrets.  Verified facts from a friend.
6757 2018-05-22 13:03:02 Oil going down in price at $72.50 is like Bitcoin going down in price at $16k, perspective #OOTT

6762 2018-05-22 13:02:37 Yeah, but crude oil prices have been going up because of geopolitical risk caused directly by Trump pulling out of Iran deal
6763 2018-05-22 13:02:27 Ache Din #India Fumes .Oil prices during UPA were over $120 a barrel but Ex PM MMS spared common man#BJP Govt raises prices indiscriminately no respite for consumer #Govt sud pass the excise duty to Petroleum companies When BJP was in oppo boot was on other foot @narendramodi
6764 2018-05-22 13:02:26 That's not right, what are the USA's interest in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? Or say in the Middle East?Syria, Libya, what were they in Iraq? I quote Trump "Jobs Jobs Jobs for everyone" now convince me that he is only interested in peace, not in oil and resources of others?
6765 2018-05-22 13:01:57 Scotland's geographic share of tax revenue from oil is already included in the financial data Scot govt website. Still £13bn deficit.
6766 2018-05-22 13:01:51 I heard from some spittle-flecked, frothing unionist on LBC yesterday that Scottish oil is so expensive to extract that it’s almost worthless to anyone. That’ll be their next line of attack on this terrible burden of ours.

6772 2018-05-22 13:00:54 Lots of great replies! The price is another big one! Since perfume has more oil concentrate, it often reflects in the price tag.

I suspect  collusion with the Oil companies to keep the price high

6787 2018-05-22 12:59:39 So, yet again, you’re breaking that pledge that you won’t get involved overseas. You should have said at the time that it was qualified by ‘unless there’s oil involved. The other signatories to the treaty with Iran are standing by it. Your standing in the world decreases daily

6791 2018-05-22 12:59:19 Inflation PLUS increased US dependency on foreign oil. It's what Russia & Saudis desperately need to stop the collapse of their economies due to low oil prices. Trump is selling us out, gallon by gallon, dollar by dollar, to other countries' interests.

6854 2018-05-22 12:53:40 They're literally twice the price this summer. It's insane. Surging oil prices are to blame, according to the internet.
6855 2018-05-22 12:53:07 India fuel price at an all time high price while intl crude oil price is almost half of all time high. ($80 now, $145 in 2008). Reports say this is to keep fiscal deficit low, so Moody's doesn't downgrade us. FYI, in 2008 Moody's called its ratings as "just Opinions" #Irony
6856 2018-05-22 12:53:00 So the results are in. I’ve been on the CBD oil twice a day for a week. The last 3 nights I’ve slept 7+ hours a night. I haven’t done that in years.

6859 2018-05-22 12:52:55 Incomplete view. OCED inventories are lower in EU. Oil on water is down the most. SA and other opec inventories are down. Just warch what happens to inventories when the late June demand jump happens. The last 70 MMbl gets drained.

So David, and all calling him runt, KNEW that the throne was his & at an appointed time, after graduating humility of shepherding, he would be King.

6889 2018-05-22 12:49:34 Let me teach you oil economics
1)Petrol price fluctuates with Int. Crude oil price. During 2014 sharp increase in crude oil bcz of US and syria situation it was 105 USD/ barrel. Later situations stabilized

2018: oil is at 75 USD/ barrel still prices are high.

6890 2018-05-22 12:49:30 @noidatraffic I drive from sector 71 to sector 1 daily. I feel stupid to follow rules of driving as non follows it. Wrong side driving, breaking red light, no helmet, unauthorized parking, overloaded autos and special mention to auto stand on Indian oil building red light.
6891 2018-05-22 12:49:21 Let's be clear. We never said TRAIN caused the global price hikes of petroleum products. Tumataas nga naman presyo sa world market. What we said was that TRAIN was an added burden to consumers because of the P2.50 to P7.00 excise tax on oil.
6892 2018-05-22 12:49:16 UK equities have had a spectacular rally since late March. Obvious factors are weaker GBP, stronger oil price, M&A + idiosyncratic moves. Our view is that these drivers are getting exhausted and we believe UK equities could soon decline both in absolute and relative terms #stocks
6893 2018-05-22 12:49:07 Real gas prices are even higher re tax breaks for big oil. When ru going to repeal those? At least CA gas tax goes to something useful.

6900 2018-05-22 12:48:15 You also get a closer shave using oil. And your skin looks great afterward. No razor bumps or none of that. But you been shaving for 15 years so... keep using soap and keep those razor bumps.
6901 2018-05-22 12:47:58 When we raise this price rise concern now the Govt repliied  this is due to increase in the international  crude oil prices but during last year when the crude oil prices were low why they have not reduced the petrol/Diesel price at that time

6907 2018-05-22 12:47:22 If you put this graph on a Y-axis log scale, it should show that the 70s and 80s swings were actually just as wild. Actually, like any other commodities, oil is looking for temporary equilibria at cash cost or demand destruction levels.

6930 2018-05-22 12:44:39 This has increased in last 2 years more when the crude oil price was less. You've to open your eyes to see the blunder being done. This is all-time high which affects every other trade. Why there is no control over this?? Where are the poll promises??
6931 2018-05-22 12:44:37 Kuch bhi. Oil payments, whether to Saudi Arabia, Iran or Russia are staggered. It is not about @DrGPradhan or @OfficeOfRGRG but Petroleum Ministry, Commerce Ministry & BoP. Always paid when ₹ is stronger. It has to do with trading economics.

Can potentially slow down the recovery.

6989 2018-05-22 12:38:38 Collectively democracies have lots of people, resources, tech so don't "need" trade with autocracies (even for oil). Market access is nice to have but even that's pretty marginal with all the hassles.

6992 2018-05-22 12:38:20 Ok ... checked in to the dealership for my $100 () oil change at 0832. Let’s see how long it takes.

6994 2018-05-22 12:37:56 @BBCNews doesn’t understand the nature of the law; in this case the cannabis oil is not made ‘illegal’ under the MDA, rather access to ‘controlled drugs’ is regulated.
6995 2018-05-22 12:37:54 @WhiteHouse @PressSec 2) China cutting tariffs/import duties to 10-15% & taking out all Spyware from ZTE & Huawei phones & hardware are a fair solution.

6997 2018-05-22 12:37:33 What?  I sorta feel that you got your reply’s crossed.  We were talking about cannabis oil. 

But you had cat piss on your weed?  Or was it poor quality?  But you oct more.

 My problem with weed the plant is it makes me lazy (and fat). I don’t need any help in either area.

7019 2018-05-22 12:35:08 Nope. Burning oil is burning oil. And second-hand cooking oil is positively packed with lovely carcinogens and toxic particulates.
7020 2018-05-22 12:35:08 @JoeSquawk @SquawkCNBC @FoxBusiness @realDonaldTrump Joe, commodities/oil traders ALL WANT price of oil to rise which generates trading, etc so they mention every fear imaginable...BUT SHALE IS RAMPING UP, #NDakota pumping 1.5mil BARRELS A DAY NOW! More US production everywhere

7023 2018-05-22 12:35:00 The amount of times I’ve found the ones in oil have gone off within a couple of weeks. Maybe it’s the basil. @thomeagle you need to be a whole lot more specific than that mate. Canning can be dangerous #botulism
7024 2018-05-22 12:34:55 South America and Africa, leading to thousands of deaths, illegal oil wars and the destruction of entire nations like Libya, Syria, and soon Iran. after legit Governments been overthrown by us, private companies move In to ensure that resources are exploited. You know that.

7026 2018-05-22 12:34:43 Kung naging $80/barrel ang oil, temporary aalisin ang Train excise tax sa crudo but what if tumagal ng ilang buwan nasa $80 pa rin? 
Then saan kukuha revenue para sa buildbuildbuild prog? E di lagot  lugi tayo

7029 2018-05-22 12:34:06 Under UPA government, petrol prices were directly related to crude oil. 

Under BJP government, petrol prices are a function of crude oil, India's GDP and subsidies, combined oil used in diyas across temples in India, the planetary alignment, and Nehru's oily skin.
7030 2018-05-22 12:34:02 The neoliberalsphere of unregulated capital would be more accurate as the EU will continue to use English. Laffan is right but Ireland will remain open for US business w EU rules. We are certainly not buying snake oil from Paterson & chums.
7031 2018-05-22 12:34:01 take all these reports with a grain of salt, when Italy and Spain banks are having major problems and the Euro is tanking this Oil rally could get shot in the foot this year on "sudden" Europe banking/economy problems #OOTT

7036 2018-05-22 12:33:11 You can measure those items, coal and oil can be scrubbed to make it clean, the regs protecting water are in place, EPA biggest violator but they're above the law,  question is the new regs you want to install achievable and is the consumer willing to pay?, answer those 1st

7039 2018-05-22 12:32:11 This calculations are fake i wasted hours solving...there is no dealers commission no transport cost no refinery cost no tax ...few figures are true like inflation, ex rate, crude oil price...calculation makes no sense

7041 2018-05-22 12:32:08 All these Oil Marketing companies OMCs were getting divested by transferring shares to LIC under UPA regime. Bad investment back then.

7061 2018-05-22 12:30:16 No. Canada should be using it’s own natural resources instead of selling them (along w billions in subsidies) to big oil from the US & China!

7064 2018-05-22 12:30:10 Your answer is simple

In Britain, Germany and Saudi Arabia and...

Nobody steals oil platform.

The head of the bank does not steal $ 3000 million (3 billion dollars) and does not escape to Canada.

7068 2018-05-22 12:29:41 The government is taking the matter of oil prices seriously. The petroleum minister will have a meeting with the officials of the oil companies tomorrow. We are working out a formula to reduce the prices," Amit Shah said.
7069 2018-05-22 12:29:34 It's 2 hikes a year for 3 years, not including this year and oil going up is inflationary but Brexit might be a spanner in the works.
7070 2018-05-22 12:29:16 If you're out of shaving cream, use olive oil. It works just as good, if not better.
7071 2018-05-22 12:29:13 I bet $1 the oil flows unfettered.   These 56 crude oil and refined product tankers are all owned by #Iran. Combined, they can carry up to nearly 90 million barrels of crude oil alone; currently holding 39 million. #OOTT

7095 2018-05-22 12:26:21 Or it may save it, in that England knows they need the North Sea oil and the Irish tax rate for offshore corporate entities. Hence, Ireland and Scotland’s unwillingness to leave the EU could be the straw that breaks the back of Brexit.

7103 2018-05-22 12:25:40 Heritage Foundation is notoriously skewed. That is a fact. Secondly, “war on coal” didn’t exist. Just as the age changes, so does the demand of energy type. Coal was overthrown by oil. Coal ALSO, is a terrible energy that kills people with its byproduct.

7148 2018-05-22 12:19:44 Are families really worse off due to Brexit? Families are worse off generally, as prices are rising - the increase in crude oil prices and therefore petrol prices is not down to Brexit! #brexit
7149 2018-05-22 12:19:41 Who is Amit Shah to declare that Petroleum prices will come into control shortly?
Is he an elected member of Union govt, representative of Oil & Petroleum ministry , official of any ranks ..who is he to day that?
7150 2018-05-22 12:19:37 @NATO Saudi Arabia paid Trump $1B.  Trump withdrew from IRAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM to increase crude oil price.  SELFISH.

7167 2018-05-22 12:17:10 Umm... it wasn't a case of WM allowing or disallowing SG anything; it was SG and SNP using GERS as the authoritative figures in an attempt to bolster their case for independence. Of course, they had to add in a hideously optimistic figure of oil and gas taxation revenue to do so.

7183 2018-05-22 12:15:44 @realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia paid you $1B so you withdrew from Iran nuclear deal to increase the oil price. We know US control OIL PRICE.
7184 2018-05-22 12:15:44 Lol you're so naughty though! Oil so far!
7185 2018-05-22 12:15:43 No, the tax/fuel duty doesn't go to the oil company, it goes to tax revenue. That pays for the NHS, which offsets the insane costs the USA pays for "medical insurance".
7186 2018-05-22 12:15:33 Not surprising since this administration was paid for by money from Big Oil. We will be begging for $4 gas by 2020. Don’t worry though, those big raises we got from the tax bill should cover the gas increase.

If only #OPEC S.Arabia/Gulf would stop stabbing US in the back by cutting Oil supplies +push $90-100 Oil barrel?
7190 2018-05-22 12:14:44 I think mediocrity is overstating. He under achieved at PSG, a place where massive wages and egos have buried literally every manager they’ve had in the oil money era. Before that he exceeded expectations on a limited budget in a league with Barca & Real & in Europe
7191 2018-05-22 12:14:42 I suppose only education would help. Guides like the one we've done and also some simple comparisons such as they wouldn't put bad oil into their cars and expect them to work well.

7198 2018-05-22 12:13:53 Amid high prices due to TRAIN law & oil price hikes, there’s more -

- LRT 1 fares could increase by Php5-7 by August

- Water rates in NCR could go up by Php8.42 to Php12.69 per cu. m soon

- 170 private schools in NCR will hike tuition by 5-15% this year

Kaya pa mga ka-DDS? 
7199 2018-05-22 12:13:51 The main problem that I see is that Scotland just can't afford it, it is just not financially possible unless they can keep all the oil & gas revenue and that will never happen, not in our lifetimes at least.
7200 2018-05-22 12:13:47 once nga magtaas ang gasolina, the economy will be greatly affected, goods and businesses rely on oil bc most of the goods and produces are transported

7224 2018-05-22 12:11:06 Analysts are already warning of an eventual return to $100 oil. That's a remarkable swing considering that crude crashed to just $26 a barrel barely two years ago.

2) An average of 100000 Cr debt on all indian oil Mkt companies
3) No strategic reserve of Fuel for our armed forces
4) No strategic reserve of Fuel for nation
7228 2018-05-22 12:10:35 And those worries about having enough energy. We have one of the highest solar adoption rates in the world.

7290 2018-05-22 12:04:05 Interesting balancing act. Putin benefits from Trump leaving Iran agreement because it further destabilizes the region, raising price of oil.

7416 2018-05-22 11:50:51 Oil prices in international market r decided by OPEC,not Saudi Arab wch is only one member of this body like many other as Iran,Iraq,Kuwait etc who do regular meetings n decide da price n reduce da oil production if prices r low,so our oil minister is either a fool r fooling arnd

7427 2018-05-22 11:49:35 Crude oil price = $88/ Barrel (1 barrel = 2 kilometers × 88 = $176)

Refinery + Dealer Margin= {$34}×8%×12×8 

Ramadan cess of Gulf = $786×72 

Taxes = 75% Less than Nehru & Manmohan

7429 2018-05-22 11:49:24 price hike of fuel directly influnce all other commodities. If it is a short term event, we are ready to bear the cost, but as it seems that the crude oil price will increase more, then clearly this is not a good arrangement to get the funding. Need to be more innovative.
7430 2018-05-22 11:49:12 diesel is cheaper cuz its just oil.. u can make it in a lab in huge quantities.. unlike gas which you have to find from fossils and its a finite resource

7523 2018-05-22 11:37:16 I think you have forgot to mention the crude oil price.
 Since November 2014, there has been a 54 percent increase in excise duty on petrol and  addition to the this, RS 8 per liter as Road Cess. Theese are the main reasons for historic hike of petrol prices.

7538 2018-05-22 11:35:44 Trump has already started to damage the economy. His Iran stance already is affecting the price of oil.
7539 2018-05-22 11:35:43 Lot of cooperation from all opposition parties including will power of BJP both are required to control oil price including implementing GST in oil. GST will give marginal benefit. Still it will be a benefit only. And in fact oil must come under GST.

7546 2018-05-22 11:35:01 The county is so divided because of Trump and people attack each other rather than truly talk about what's happening.
All the regulations that protect nature being nullified so Trump's buddies can drill for oil thus endangering not only the land but drinking waters for millions.

7556 2018-05-22 11:33:40 Poor you. They don't give antibiotics here if they can avoid it. Sinus pain is horrid... can you take the decongestant type tablets like 'sudafed' (I can't, make me worse) I guess you take paracetamol & ibuprofen...steam..'Olbas' oil to inhale. 
7557 2018-05-22 11:33:33 I had indomie made with kush oil and had to drive home. You know those broken white lines on the road? I drove 1cm to the right of it at 20KMPH from Ikeja to Surulere. Dozed off for a split second between Fadeyi and Jibowu.

That was my last day
7558 2018-05-22 11:33:31 The path that India was going in UPA we would have been in a deeper mess, NDA is basically cleaning up their mess. High oil prices helped the government to do it in a benign way...but agree now tax has to reduce

7560 2018-05-22 11:33:29 If the petrol and diesel price can be fixed by Oil company itself then y v need an minister for this dept...?
7561 2018-05-22 11:33:16 It's interesting. You bash the credibility of people in the oil & gas industry which benefit from lax CO2 regulations, yet don't realize your own pitfall when you defend scientists who bank on public funding. If AGW isn't an issue, it would never be funded. Time to exaggerate!

Your rod and Your staff,
    they comfort me.

You anoint my head with oil;

7565 2018-05-22 11:32:34 Every company that sells bottled water will lobby against this if or when they feel it necessary. Nestle CEO already said he believes water should become a privatised commodity like natural gas and oil. #GangsterCapitalism

7568 2018-05-22 11:32:25 @gmc @gm @mtbarra @BarackObama @realSonaldTrump @ConsumerReports @EPA @CaliforniaEPA  gmc should strive to use less oil, not avoid warranty work by setting the consumption rate out of the roof! Do the right thing
7569 2018-05-22 11:32:24 Sharmine is right. Netanyahu is actually a willful liar. The governments of the USA, Israel and Saudi Arabia are the real axis of EVIL . You can count the UK & French Vassals to that select group too. Their aim is to steal the OIL in the Middle East and save the PETRO DOLLAR !!!
7570 2018-05-22 11:32:22 Govt kitty is swelling with GST and if fiscal deficit rose,does not matter for reducing oil prices but relief to public is more important

7617 2018-05-22 11:26:27 It's true. Illegality - floor, mirrors, oil burnt, turbo, battery, smoking rear, rear wing (DRS), exhaust gasses (Vettel's 3rd paddle). But well, they'll say it's stretching the rules and innovate.
7618 2018-05-22 11:26:27 Really more like a country that must pay tribute, in the form of oil, water, electricity, and taxes.

It’s not an occupation, which is far worse and we can’t forget the real occupations in the world today.

7642 2018-05-22 11:22:09 When SCROTUS goes around threatening a big oil producer like Iran and destabilizing the Middle East, higher oil prices are a natural result. Vlad Putin, sharply pinched by low oil prices, is smiling as Americans are forced to pay more.

7656 2018-05-22 11:20:13 You can't deny that this US policy has worked a treat in Venezuela. It's scuppered Chavez's plan to build a successful communist state in the US's backyard with an oil rich economy. I think you should take a course in geo politics rather than worry about the weather
7657 2018-05-22 11:19:54 Crude oil price = $88/ Barrel (1 barrel = 2 kilometers × 88 = $176)

7677 2018-05-22 11:17:50 I disagree. Trumps latest foreign policy moves I believe have affected oil prices which in turn affects gas prices. Examples like backing out of Iran deal, tariffs and middle east policies.

7688 2018-05-22 11:16:50 Lol yes you would be up the Clyde without a paddle without our oil.. don't worry tho Blair and co shifted the marine borders a bit further north.. so as to have English gas and oil fields.. so you won't be totally skint 
7689 2018-05-22 11:16:36 Only problem is that they are trying to recruit those they laid off. From those I have spoken to, they have set up their own businesses, or no longer want to be in the oil & gas industry. A lot of these firms will need to hire inexperienced staff and invest in training as well.
7690 2018-05-22 11:16:34 Oil companies are not purchasing crude oil daily morning like we are buying fish. So what is the logic of changing it every day?
The price of the petrol should be  fixed only on the purchase price company paid

7694 2018-05-22 11:16:23 @theJeremyVine the problem with woodburners is people not using them correctly. Because the fuel is not "pure" like gas or oil, wood contains moisture and is also sometimes treated, coupled with owners not using the air controls correctly - starving the fire of combustion air.

7704 2018-05-22 11:14:50 There is rampant unemployment in the country. & then these ever increasing oil prices.

How will an unemployed Indian sustain his family?

7783 2018-05-22 11:04:36 Fantastic volume on #I3E, expecting the buying pressure to continue well into close. License awards will be closely followed by funding. Funding was on the table at $50/bbl, oil now at $80/bbl. Perfect storm for a massive re-rate. Holding into the £’s...
7784 2018-05-22 11:04:35 this is sad it all about there bottom line creed is all it is we have enough Oil in the USA for decades ,have a great day
7785 2018-05-22 11:04:32 @scotgov is looking to ensure the people in #Scotland the fixation on separation is the #tory MPs and puppet #ScotTories They have done nothing for Scotland and want to continue control maybe the oil price increase and being out of #EUwill will be a non fear this time #indyref2

Tuesday calls for Burgers & @BeavertownBeer Neck Oil 
That is all.
7789 2018-05-22 11:03:42 The first BOLD step @dpradhanbjp took on fuel was to link price directly with Market as per global standard

Next should be to bring it under GST

and the third SHOULD be, oil companies privatized and open market for international players

Make road tax ANNUAL & not lifetime

7797 2018-05-22 11:03:00 I don’t think you should have it, because you don’t need it. & it makes the country less safe when there are 300 mil guns in circulation.
7798 2018-05-22 11:02:54 This math is quite illogical. You must compare the fuel price with International Crude oil price and USD conversion rate. Speaks a lot about how you would spin things to suit your narrative. However this parameter alone cannot be used to compare two govts.
7799 2018-05-22 11:02:54 So the Vice Provost makes $400k and the administrative assistant makes $40k? I thought Liberals were against such inequalities?
7800 2018-05-22 11:02:39 Stretchmark maybe ya, ada bio oil bisa []
7801 2018-05-22 11:02:30 Mr. @realDonaldTrump Buy Venezuelan oil is to do business with the drug traffickers Maduro and Diosdado Cabello, no longer support commercial double standards and suspend business with this country today governed by criminals. Colombia and Mexico are ready to meet that demand.

7804 2018-05-22 11:01:46 Since Trump got $1B from Saudi Arabia he withdrew from Iran deal and increased the CRUDE OIL PRICE.  Shame on him

7820 2018-05-22 11:00:08 I hope the upcoming oil Cartels have agreed on how to loot Turkana Oil. We just don't want a bloody civil war in our beautiful country.
7821 2018-05-22 11:00:07 Don’t you hate when you make a joke about gun oil and someone tells you there’s a lube called that?

7825 2018-05-22 10:59:45 What about procurement charges paid by oil companies during import of Crude Oil? Is that also going to state Govt? More than @ArvindKejriwal and @MamataOfficial only MNC like Reliance Petroleum benefited Don't tell me now that most of companies owned by state Govt. #justasking
7826 2018-05-22 10:59:40 He has gone to find the oil wells so that the prices becomes cheaper.
7827 2018-05-22 10:59:39 We do need pipeline. When a solar house is made they do use hydro for backup. And think about your car, cellphones, etc. Now start thinking about layoffs. No other country will do business in Canada. Think long & hard how oil is used in your life.

7852 2018-05-22 10:54:59 Please send your data on numbers of Venezuelan workers who "starved to death in the streets" in the last 5 yrs. The economic crisis in Venezuela is largely the result of the decline in oil prices which was engineered by the US and Saudis to cripple Russian & Venezuelan economies.
7853 2018-05-22 10:54:57 Wah oil price increase sa palawan 
7854 2018-05-22 10:54:55 Oye ! Balle-Balle, breaking news Indian Oil earn a hefty profit of 21,346 crores. Common people should stop crying even though if you are paying high.
7855 2018-05-22 10:54:47 Increase in oil prices improved our chances of getting out.

7859 2018-05-22 10:54:21 Ur comparing with crude oil price of UPA era of $150 and based on that ur saying it should be reduced now. In reality UPA subsidized heavily leading to loss to oil marketing companies as well increase in fiscal deficiency. One should not go into that debt trap path
7860 2018-05-22 10:54:07 As a Virginian, it's scarily accurate.  But then again, we have idiot pizzarias that don't know how to lightly oil a pan.  But, for food...well, northern VA is a suburb of DC...hub of many embassies and foreign dignitaries...so we have way too many different restaurants.
7861 2018-05-22 10:54:03 Godwin from FoE Nigeria asking Shell about oil spills and gas flaring in Nigeria. When will you stop gas flaring in Nigeria? Why are you in a governing council overseeing Ogoni clean-up process? You have escused yourself from similar role at NAM. #StopShell #PeoplevsShell

7864 2018-05-22 10:53:54 Speaker from @amnesty at #ShellAGM: Shell's slow response time to oil spills is in breach of Nigerian law.
7865 2018-05-22 10:53:53 Amnesty notes that Shell takes 7 days to clean up its oil spill (as opposed to Eni's average 2 day reaction time) - why is that so? Nigerian law asks for much shorter reaction times #ShellAGM

7869 2018-05-22 10:53:13 I don’t drive one of those monsters, I drive a more fuel efficient car. I would like to have a REAL-option but oil companies control their market.I also want solar panels. 
but their prices are too high. We CAN do better than fossil based fuels.
7870 2018-05-22 10:53:11 ちーくんと話したい！！きっと私も恥ずかしくなっちゃうな
7871 2018-05-22 10:53:06 You might be right. However, the fact also lies there that UPA had emptied all tijoris of Oil companies, they needed enough time to fill back and be ready for world competition.
Are we looking at short term gains rather than long term?
7872 2018-05-22 10:53:01 Venezuela's got oil. That's all this administration is concerned about. #FollowTheMoney
7873 2018-05-22 10:53:00 they are fighting over an oil well i believe
7874 2018-05-22 10:52:02 There was a place not too far from me when I lived in Paris

But they changed the oil a bit too regularly for it to be authentic

And I think French food laws prohibit mushy peas
7875 2018-05-22 10:51:56 Can you compare the Excise Duty on Crude Oil ..!! UPA 2 vrs NDA 2

7878 2018-05-22 10:51:35 You mean... that's not how you put oil in your engine? Goddammit!
7879 2018-05-22 10:51:35 Certainly a bit easier to be socialist when a) you have a lot of oil and b) oil price is high
7880 2018-05-22 10:51:34 So if you use an essential oil burner in the darker corners, it won't want to stick around. Then you can catch it and put it outside. You can also use a long brush to catch it, light pressure won't harm it and it won't be able to escape the bristles!

7891 2018-05-22 10:50:06 R u serious? What is the current account and fiscal deficiency in 2014? How do you thing it got reduced? Government borrowed more than what it can earn and it was due to oil subsidies under UPA?  It has to reduce to acceptable levels.
7892 2018-05-22 10:49:59 May 2004 - Crude oil price $52.87
May 2014 - Crude oil price $108.8

7894 2018-05-22 10:49:47 Following weathering and prior to applying oils, it is recommended to de – grease the surface using Methylated Spirit and a lint free cloth. 2 x thinly applied coats of an Osmo Oil are recommended, allowing drying between coats

7897 2018-05-22 10:49:41 It is. I'm in Indiana. You wouldn't believe the fight we had just to get CBD oil approved here. Yet, *every* day there are dozens of opioid ODs. We've had a sharp increase in HIV & hep C cases. Our legislature can't pull its collective head out its ass & do something about it.
7898 2018-05-22 10:49:40 They also help to mask the discoloration in the timber. With Red Grandis, we would recommend fixing the timber up then allowing it to weather for at least 6 weeks prior to applying an Osmo Oil.

7900 2018-05-22 10:49:22 Guys!!! Try tea trea oil in treating your pimples. Super effective.
7901 2018-05-22 10:49:13 The first signs of greying would indicate that a thin coat of oil is required to top up the UV filters. Choosing transparent , horizontal specific products with colour such as Osmo Decking oil or Natural Oil wood stain would be more effective at blocking UV light.
7902 2018-05-22 10:49:07 Ok wait of time next time definitely congress government change your business address change the Indian Oli to Indian bucket company
All possible lot of country same to same use GST policy just wait and watch 2019 definitely change your company oil to bucket company

7906 2018-05-22 10:48:31 Hi @GarryMartin With Clear Osmo UV protection oil, some of the small ledges on this project could collect water and lead to an acceleration in the natural greying from UV light. This could occur after 6 – 12 months in exposed locations.
7907 2018-05-22 10:48:31 It was a high school English teacher who, very cleverly, kicked me into gear as well..... she started a friendly conversation with a 15-yr-old me asking this question: "So, Kevin, I guess from your school work you're planning to work at the oil refinery after graduation, right?"

7911 2018-05-22 10:48:15 #fuellootbysuitboot If only people understand that India imports 80% of oil consumption from overseas as domestic exploration is minimum and reserves in existence are not sufficient.

7937 2018-05-22 10:45:02 The point u need to learn from an economist is that regardless of who won 2015 election Nigeria’s economy was on this road we are in today. Not because of who won 2015 but because leaders of the past failed to save money when oil was booming. The crash of oil prices revealed this

This has been d typical mindset of #ModiGovt .We didn't get d benefits of low crude oil prices from 2014- 2017 as d Govt consistently increased d excise duty& VAT. Now that d prices have gone up globally, we R still forced to pay through our nose.
7942 2018-05-22 10:44:33 Infact after deregulation it's the Oil Companies that decide Price even on a DAY to DAY basis now .. Deamad is peak , market is down in mid east .. that's the reason .. this situation

8055 2018-05-22 10:28:12 Thank *you* for having the courage to take on the auto and oil industries and moving us to sustainable energy.  Were it not for you, we would likely have continued to senselessly burn fossil fuel for the foreseeable future.
8056 2018-05-22 10:27:58 UK temperatures are just above seasonal norm today. Expected to remain above for the next couple of weeks.

2 An average of 100000 Cr debt on all indian oil Mkt companies

3 No strategic reserve of Fuel for our armed forces

8060 2018-05-22 10:27:35 to come back and for `leaders` to care about the earth`s warming climate and to act accordingly:( instead of doing the opposite of that for short term profit but long term ruin). I owe KM 0. I pray the deal dies or that Alta refines own oil.
8061 2018-05-22 10:27:30 In the upa time you have to check the international price of the oil, & in NDA time you have to check the international price of the oil. After that we can compare the comparison dada.
8062 2018-05-22 10:27:22 Your answer to that is in Murdoch and his MSM monopoly! Keith Murdoch was one of the founding members of IPA. Murdoch has his sticky fingers in lots of pies including oil in Gaza.
8063 2018-05-22 10:27:18 Comparing with UPA era rates means asking for subsidies. UPA heavily subsidized fossil fuels by putting a big hole in oil supplying companies. Now it's completely market driven.If anyone want reduction then state governments has to reduce their share of taxes as bulk goes to them
8064 2018-05-22 10:27:14 Now what kind of green tea oil do you use?
8065 2018-05-22 10:27:11 India will be hit from sanctions on Iran and Venezuela both. It would be appropriate for India to form formidable alliances and don’t bother about US sanctions and continue with purchasing oil from Iran and Venezuela
8066 2018-05-22 10:27:09 I have a budget plan for my oil deliveries. I don't pay as they fill the tank. I used to pay 300 a month. I just got the budget plan for the next year in the mail. Thank you, DT. It will now be $378 a month. So much for helping the middle class.
8067 2018-05-22 10:27:08 I've been guilty of this. Now my bigger concern is that olive oil actually IS olive oil! Turns out many are cut with cheap, high-n6 soybean oil!  So, I just usually avoid "olive oil." I'm happy enough eating animal fats (mostly tallow, butter and ghee).

8073 2018-05-22 10:25:56 They was/ are one of the leading oil exporters and sitting on the biggest oil reserve and because of corrupt politicians been given the easy route through socialism, this country who should be near poverty free/ inflation resonable, are in the shit.
8074 2018-05-22 10:25:39 He should have sent coconut oil
8075 2018-05-22 10:25:20 While chatting to mechanics at a local garage, they told me about someone who complained about how much it cost to fill their engine with oil they Literally filled the engine up to the rocker cover cap, they did drain it for them.
8076 2018-05-22 10:25:09 Protest the oil price hike, there's no reason for price hike. It's merely speculation and price fixing. #loweroilprice. Don't just be meek.
8077 2018-05-22 10:25:09 I think you should write screenplays for Hollywood. Oil is plentiful in the USA and there is plenty of “clean beautiful coal” according to the orange clown in the White House. Sorry, but if the USA benefited from the “invention” of climate change, why blame the Chinese for it?

8079 2018-05-22 10:24:41 “Coconut oil is about 90% saturated fat, which is a higher percentage than butter (about 64% saturated fat), beef fat (40%), or even lard (also 40%). Too much saturated fat in the diet is unhealthy because it raises "bad" LDL cholesteroL”
8080 2018-05-22 10:24:30 el pueblo de venezuela los mando al carajo. hablo 95% de la poblacion electoral que pide que se vayan. ni que CNE ponga los numeros que ponga proceso electoral fue ilegalmente convocado y violatorio de la constitucion. nada que argumenten cambia la situacion
8081 2018-05-22 10:24:16 Some months back, oil prices had touched bottom $30. Rupaya was stable then. Why Modi govt didn’t reduce oil prices? Can you give taxes break up  during UPA rule and now?

8084 2018-05-22 10:23:56 all I'm saying is that Mogg has a history of lobbying for things beneficial to his investment portfolio (like I said, oil, gas and tobacco are easy examples, brexit appears to be too) without declaring his personal interests as is required of MPs - suspicion seems justified

8095 2018-05-22 10:21:43 I still swear by hot water with honey and lemon! I hate honey but it does help. Good to drink a couple of times during the day if you can and also hot baths with lavender oil can be good before bed

8097 2018-05-22 10:21:38 The dangers are very real.  A big storm could take out oil/gas pipelines, electrical power grids, and satellites in orbit.  A solar storm called the Carrington event occurred in 1859.  If it happened today it is estimated it would cause more than $1 trillion damage!
8098 2018-05-22 10:21:28 The same countries that would start a war in Iraq over oil are more than capable or putting awful people in power to secure the resources of the land. Yes corruption is a major setback but it’s only only added ontop of the mess what was left to us in the first place

8101 2018-05-22 10:20:16 Didn't have anything like coconut cream so I just used coconut oil to fry up the onion then added in more when I put the spices in.
8102 2018-05-22 10:20:08 No his and hers coconut oil?
8103 2018-05-22 10:19:47 Bombs away Bolton will convince Trump to attack Iran, then we'll have plenty of oil. <--- I predict you'll hear this argument soon. Just like when we went to Iraq.

8108 2018-05-22 10:18:39 Sorry, but the west has plenty of oil and less reliance on the Saudis cannot explain the move away from fossils. Fracking, Canadian tar sand: oil abounds. We need to end the oil era not because there is a shortage, but because it will bite us when the climate is really screwed.

8115 2018-05-22 10:17:34 Hi Scott. 1) I would expect an Indy Scotland, of whatever hue, to introduce similar oil taxation policies to those of Norway. 2) Businesses with outlets in Scotland would contribute VAT in Scotland, not in a UK head office. 3) Exports originating in Scotland would pay tax in

8123 2018-05-22 10:16:06 Brother transportation cost depends on distance from where u r getting oil...if prices will be same then their will difference in the revenues of each petrol pump will generate....which may lead to few suppliers for long distance...i think this will clear ur question...

8129 2018-05-22 10:15:17 I think Robert was adviser to Zimbabwe in the days when they had their own currency (plus massive gold, diamond & coal reserves backing it up)- unlimited Govt borrowing didnt seem to work there, so he went to Venezuela (massive oil & mineral reserves) - it didnt work there either
8130 2018-05-22 10:15:14 Tar Sands bitumen had its day when the US was a net importer of oil. Now, they are net exporters, and have a domestic supply of better, cheaper oil from shale.
8131 2018-05-22 10:15:11 Mogg has a history of backing his business interests undisclosed in Parliament (tobacco, oil, gas etc - evidence is readily available, Google it), and obvs gets an MP salary on top of his investments, so being an MP as well is plausibly relatively lucrative - the guy is shady imo

8164 2018-05-22 10:08:41 Those oil producers don't know how to extract the oil and whers to sell. It ends up in the hands of US, UK & allies. In return these clever dicks sell weapons to oil producers. Then the war mongers beat the drum of war. Oil producers go to war slaughtering each other.

Crude oil prices in 2017-18 = 51$-66$ per barrel. Petrol prices = 75-85 rs.

8170 2018-05-22 10:08:00 Congress left a huge debt which Modi government had to pay post 2014. Clear your facts first. What is the reason that inspire of UAE having its own oil, percentage rise in price of oil in last three years is more than in India
8171 2018-05-22 10:07:28 my calculation is based on te extra money we paid since 2014, after crude prices fell drastically. Oil started companies are Rs 35 per ltr when we were paying 70. that's extirely taxes. Now if you calculate number of ltrs sold per day and multiple that with tax, find the figures.

8174 2018-05-22 10:07:01 If there is such a huge demand for oil, why is it having a hard time reaching $65/bbl instead of the $100+ a few years ago? Guess what? If the p[rice goes up, OPEC will just open the taps a bit more.

8179 2018-05-22 10:06:26 Leaving the Iran deal has caused the gas prices to rise dramatically in the U.S.  Gas is over $3.00 per gallon now and will most likely rise another 50 cents Still don't understand why since the US produces enough oil and gas to be self sufficient.

8197 2018-05-22 10:03:37 Ur calculation is based on price but that the money never paid. Took oil on credit and money spent somewhere else which was supposed to be paid. Now next govt paid that money from the same tax collection. U do ur maths right.
8198 2018-05-22 10:03:35 @dpradhanbjp @narendramodi Seems difficult that you will form Govt because of oil prices

8249 2018-05-22 09:55:13 Agree with you on the idiot FM. But prices are not rockbottom right now. Also please re-read thread where I explained why prices were sustained when oil prices were actually rockbottom
8250 2018-05-22 09:55:02 The ruling party's spoky says oil price is also because of the 'legacy issues'! In other words, all the people starting with UPA 1 and 2 to #Nehru are responsible for oil price hike. The gentleman can't talk on the alternate fuel lobby and how it has played havoc with this govt.
8251 2018-05-22 09:54:42 Scottish oil means nothing to us as our government are trying to push fossil fuels out of the country gradually, for example scrapping fossil fuel-run cars by 2040. Plastics are also becoming less popular amongst people. So who is going to buy your oil?

8306 2018-05-22 09:45:54 That's nothing - they are equating the price of a barrel of oil to a ltr of diesel and petrol
Sub bhakt tali Baja rahen hain
8307 2018-05-22 09:45:51 But the hard fact is that the governments, both UPA (petrol) and NDA (diesel) were behind the deregulation. It was not done by the oil companies. Hence the onus of reducing three price is on the govt., currently it is BJP.

8311 2018-05-22 09:44:31 But oil prices will spike and that will help Russia, so it's all good!
8312 2018-05-22 09:44:15 Might do but I doubt they will raise rates - the economy is finely balanced and with storm clouds gathering it would foolish - they should also look at oil prices as transitory and therefore look through an change in inflation
8313 2018-05-22 09:44:10 No, crude oil prices were already below $100pb during election campaign, and part of the campaign idea was to look away from crude oil. So according to the promises, low crude prices shouldn't be an excuse. They knew crude prices were heading south, yet they made promises.
8314 2018-05-22 09:44:02 Wohi to tumhare jhooth ka end hai! Crude oil (hahaha) rates internationally are wayyyy down! Why aren't petrol prices???
8315 2018-05-22 09:44:00 It does Matter what doesn’t matter is when they pay because they have already recovered money from consumers . They could not pay because of banking embargo by USA.

8323 2018-05-22 09:43:33 It doesn't make sense that back when petrol was over $2.20 a litre last time, a barrel of oil was over $100 US. But today we get NZ's highest ever price at the pump at $2.30 a litre, yet the price of a barrel of oil is currently around $85 US. How is that happening? #extortion
8324 2018-05-22 09:43:00 LOL...yes, the GOP, which created the Iran we have today by over-throwing a democratically elected, secular, anti-muslim extremism, pro-western president in '53, who dared to want to keep Iran oil profits for the "Iranian People". Then installed the Shah, who murdered millions.
8325 2018-05-22 09:43:00 Also mention that crulde oil prices per barrel during UPA 1,2 increased from less than $30 to $111.63 still price was never this high. Current price per barrel is for that matter $79. Do u want to say something about that? #FuelOnFire

8404 2018-05-22 09:29:14 CoT Update: Speculators Selling as Crude Oil Rallies
Large speculators have been reducing their overall net-long exposure to oil as the commodity continues to rise to multi-year high...
8405 2018-05-22 09:29:02 "Oil" is the favorite word of people building online dating profiles in the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.
8406 2018-05-22 09:28:58 This is good for consumer... as #DrillBabyDrill and #FrackBabyFrack animal spirit returns to #crude oil producers
8407 2018-05-22 09:28:54 OIL CHANGE!
Up to 2 litre,  £59.95 inc vat
Over 2 litre, £89 inc vat
.....Offer excludes sports performance vehicles.
8408 2018-05-22 09:28:53 as per "climate change" #ParisAgreement India has To reduce carbon emission intensity of the GDP by (32 - 35%) from 2005 levels.
so, Despite fall of international prices for crude oil, India has kept high excise duty and thus reduced the possible increase in carbon emissions

8416 2018-05-22 09:28:08 If INC comes to power, will there be a transparent fuel pricing policy? 
Maybe the oil pool account should come back. And the surpluses pooled during low international prices should fund controlling prices when intl prices r high
8417 2018-05-22 09:28:07 The refiners had been holding back 55 per cent of the oil payments to Iran after the route to make payments through Halkbank was stopped in 2013, although payment of some of those funds was allowed after an initial temporary deal to lift the sanctions.
8418 2018-05-22 09:27:56 What @incindia UPA 2 govt left for @narendramodi in 2014

1 A balance payment of $6.7 billion to Iran for Crude Import

2 An average of 100000 Cr debt on all indian oil Mkt companies

3 No strategic reserve of Fuel for our armed forces

4 No strategic reserve of Fuel for nation
8419 2018-05-22 09:27:53 Make one more column and add price of crude oil per barrel

8424 2018-05-22 09:26:59 It’s paid by oil company directly not by govt. just talk about excise duty hikes after 2014

8430 2018-05-22 09:26:25 Not sure how our President has control over the price of oil since it's a publicly traded commodity.  If you want to blame someone for the hikes in fuel, how about you blame the originator of this tweet. Why aren't you blaming #OPEC who does control the price of fuel?
8431 2018-05-22 09:26:23 Dear @Swamy39, 
I fail to understand why @BJP4India or @narendramodi ji is not claiming that they have cleared dues to tone of Rs. 50,000 Crores to IRAN in 2016, that was to be paid by UPA?
Congis never pay for CrudeOil inventory and they claim that they provided low oil prices.

8448 2018-05-22 09:22:34 Crude oil price was 109 dollars per barrel in May 2014 and it's 80 dollars now. Also, when it was 50 dollars or low, this Government didn't passed it to customers, instead they raised excise duty to get more revenues.

8490 2018-05-22 09:14:42 In 2008, International crude oil price was at USD 145 and UPA set the petrol price at INR 55.07 (Mumbai).
In 2018, International crude oil price was at USD 80 and BJP set the petrol price at INR 84.40 (Mumbai).
Do you see the difference now?

8492 2018-05-22 09:14:39 @dpradhanbjp @PetroleumMin @narendramodi, excise on oil needs to be cut now as the fuel prices have become unbearable. Please do something as soon as possible. It is becoming tough to live with such high prices. The basic commodities have become expensive because of it.
8493 2018-05-22 09:14:14 Some one spilled baby oil on the stair case and there was only one wet floor sign even though the baby oil was on like 6 flights of stairs ...... if I fell could I sue for that?

The UPA govt paid just 55% of the oil bill to Iran. The money was not just 43000cr rupees as Iran wanted payment in the current value of Euros.India paid Rs 5000 cr back to Iran.

8664 2018-05-22 08:47:02 I thought we owed a huge debt to the cpny that explored the region for oil, and the payment was for them to lease the oil and its proceeds for 10 yrs....someone please shed light on this one because I'm either terribly wrong or someone is lying to Kenyans
8665 2018-05-22 08:47:02 When I bought my car, 3 years ago, petrol was 137.9pence a litre, for the 99% stuff, at my local @tesco. It's now 131.9pence but oil was $150 a barrel back then, it's only $75 a barrel now so why is petrol so expensive? Robber barons spring to mind.

8669 2018-05-22 08:46:02 Nig govt is led by a man who is sectional & tribal in all his dealings.

8682 2018-05-22 08:44:01 Reasons why petrol price is high :

Government is smartly keeping the fuel price up even the global crude oil price is low.
India's fiscal deficit is still targeted to 3.3% in 2018. We our under debt of 2 lac crore. India's fiscal deficit was 4.89% in 2013.

Soon after Nixon abandoned gold in 1971 reports in MS media how oil will run out in 50 years time.
8721 2018-05-22 08:34:09 It means nothing will come out from today's meeting. At the most oil minister ask oil company's cmd not to increase price for some time. There is no hope to  reduce price.

'Middle Eastern' countries have some of  highest per capita incomes in the world but they are not industrialized. They don't produce anything but oil and gas!
8792 2018-05-22 08:21:29 Just to control oil and boost prices... possibly
8793 2018-05-22 08:20:39 the usage of apricot oil the last few days has been eye opening

8809 2018-05-22 08:17:25 Now we have seen it all. There is enough oil but only after refining csn the oil be used. And reliance happens to be the biggest profit makers from this.  Politicians are slaves to these companies
8810 2018-05-22 08:16:44 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
8811 2018-05-22 08:16:21 Most guns used in crime are not bought at gun shows. Very few.  They are stolen. Fact.
So because someone might steal it, I can't have It?

8816 2018-05-22 08:15:43 Guns. Guns are the problem. How can you not see this??? It’s ridiculous. You realize it’s getting to the point where the gov of Texas blamed doors on the shooting. TOO MANY DOORS. Give me a break. TOO MANY GUNS.
8817 2018-05-22 08:15:39 I second the local honey suggestion - also try steam baths with Olbas oil. Chest percussion might also help (It's a cystic fibrosis thing, but I've found it helps a lot for chest infections and the like too)

8820 2018-05-22 08:14:56 For the welfare of the nation. Our nation wants to know the exact reasons for hike in oil prices. What sort of taxes are being levied and wher e are these funds being used. Y do the common people have to pay for the luxuries of these big conglomerates

8824 2018-05-22 08:14:16 Let's face it, PMB has nothing to offer order than just wanting to be a president. He lacks the capacity to lead. Nigeria has no direction, as we speak nothing seems to be working. To crown it all up, we might go into recession even as oil price increases. He is unfit to lead.
8825 2018-05-22 08:14:13 anyone who argues about oil money, let them prove a single government, a single bank, a single investment without oil money involved in it.
On the other side for some people its easy to use oil money as taunt, ask the countries where wars are imposed cause of oil money.
8826 2018-05-22 08:14:13 Look at oil prices... trump said there’s so much oil being produced right now that the prices are being jacked up by opec! OPEC is I charge of our oil prices... free market with competition would let supply and demand lower those. However these greedy politicians need to f off
8827 2018-05-22 08:14:05 if oil ministry make tinkering in excise duty or prices will not be sufficient,it  reduce present as well as check future prices
8828 2018-05-22 08:14:05 Yes - I would. And it seems your making the case that a large percentage of people are mentally ill anyways.

You can clean the sliding potentiometer with a Q-tip soaked in isopropanol or ethanol, that has always alleviated the problem entirely for me.
8839 2018-05-22 08:12:49 Hi Michi, had a talk with our tech team, Iceland are only removing palm oil from own brand products. We are always reviewing recipes and ingredients and are aware of the issues with palm oil. This will be taken on board when next reviewing the recipe!
8840 2018-05-22 08:12:43 So, The Gov is tackling high air pollution in cities by targeting wood burners instead of diesel fuelled vehicles. The oil companies will be pleased. #unbelievable #really? #youvegottobekiddingme #airpollution #pollution #capitalismsucks #capitalism

8846 2018-05-22 08:11:41 We have bad people too. They sell drugs & rob people. Just don’t have access to guns as easily as strolling into a gun show
8847 2018-05-22 08:11:12 Fuel prices are directly linked to crude oil. OPEC countries have reduced supplies. We don't have any say to bring down price., We can only reduce VAT of state taxes & central taxes, that is only way to reduce the price: Ajay Bansal, President, Petrol Pump Dealers' Association.

8863 2018-05-22 08:08:27 The £ has fallen against the $ because the pomised rate rise has not happen.

8868 2018-05-22 08:07:24 Israel built its economy without oil.  Besides  Qatar whose economy is based on oil and natural gas, Israel has the highest per capita GDP in the region.

8870 2018-05-22 08:07:17 I think other wise.. they must be pudinga state govt to add oil in their gst , instead of state tax .. which will bring down the price drastically.. its a gamble.

8879 2018-05-22 08:05:46 Sino-US negotiations aren't just about soybeans and oil. Chinese total annual imports of those goods amount to around $200B. If they want to make more joint statements on the trade deficit, manufactured goods have to come into play.

8881 2018-05-22 08:04:59 They will be more willing to give up the oil and gas when they're dying for food, fresh water, medicine, resources to sanitize their water...

8885 2018-05-22 08:04:07 Oh really?  I must have forgotten about Israel’s large oil industry since it doesn’t have one.  It is a net importer of energy.  It did discover natural gas off its coast in 2010 but this is a new development.
8886 2018-05-22 08:03:55 True, and every bank and financial institution has huge investments in oil. In that respect all money is oil money.
8887 2018-05-22 08:03:54 Just a reminder that all manmade devices are "technology". At one point in history no doubt biros were hated by the quill set, and candle aficionados cursed the oil lamp brigade. Don't blame tech for your failure to take advantage of the possibilities it presents.

8899 2018-05-22 08:02:10 While we focus on oil, the bigger concern is Rupee @ 68.86 and expected to head lower. God of oil is giving both Govt and Rupee a hard time.

8913 2018-05-22 08:00:44 Any oil spill will release toxic compounds into the environment regardless of whether it floats. And this so-called "peer-reviewed" research suggests most of the product *might* float. Some will inevitably sink because marine water is not 100% saltwater.

Crude oil is bought by Reliance Industries the only manufacturer of Orthoxylene in India.

It has a strong tech economy,  invests heavy in R&D and has high education levels.  It ranks high in health and happiness.

9009 2018-05-22 07:44:13 If the highest slab of GST - which is 28 per cent - is imposed, the price of petrol will come down to just Rs. 56 in Delhi. But cutting across political lines, no government has been interested in reducing excise on oil because of the revenue it brings.

only 20 % produced in India
9058 2018-05-22 07:37:16 Can the rising oil and plunging Rupee be turned into an advantage? Just wondering. What are the positives, if any?
9059 2018-05-22 07:37:07 Taken over by Russia on behalf of EU/West, no less. (spoiler: Norway had decided to stop selling oil; never got why Russia, another oil producer, would bother with less competition, for the lulz presumably.)

9069 2018-05-22 07:36:04 Am seeing a lot more internationals venturing out which is amazing. Tourism if allowed to flourish would be enormous, oil production would be secondary
9070 2018-05-22 07:36:01 Govt official to my colleague Sapna Das: Rising oil price a “crisis” situation, consumers expect govt to give relief. “Measures will have to be taken together” on impact of falling Rs,rising crude. A desicion may be likely this week #FuelOnFire @CNBCTV18Live @CNBCTV18Live
9071 2018-05-22 07:35:49 The fact is that Pharma industry, NRA, Oil industry, and countless other are buying out U.S policies

9079 2018-05-22 07:34:59 Crude Oil closes above $72 for the first time since Nov 2014, up 165% from its low in 2016.
9080 2018-05-22 07:34:29 The BJP-led government had raised excise duty nine times - totalling Rs 11.77 per litre on petrol and Rs 13.47 on diesel - between November 2014 and January 2016 to shore up finances as global oil prices fell, but then cut the tax just once in October last year by Rs 2 a litre.

9084 2018-05-22 07:33:45 #Doublecleansing is #Korean #skincare ritual. They use an oil to remove makeup and then use water based cleanser to clean sweat and dirt. You can use coconut oil as an oil cleanser. Take few drops of it, Message all over face and neck then wash it off with your favorite cleanser.

9095 2018-05-22 07:30:40 The SkyRocketing Prices of Crude Oil reminds me of the UPA's 2nd tenure and also the hype which the media made abt it. Now, the circumstances are same and no media is carrying coverage abt it. Can someone from the ruling party address the nation abt it.

9110 2018-05-22 07:28:20 We buy petrol by paying USD. as our imports are increasing YOY compared to exports....means we r paying more n more foreign currency to other countries {in other words rupee is depreciating}... So as to buy oil as India is second largest importer of oil...
9111 2018-05-22 07:28:19 Then we are going to expect electric flights  and  jets, nice . Wait Wait I have a doubt , what about Heavy oil generators??
9112 2018-05-22 07:28:08 Article 6-1, par#2. The US occupation troops are in Syria and Iraq. The fact that it's illegal, isn't important for Trump. He wants to get all the oil from the Middle East.

9147 2018-05-22 07:22:48 The town isn’t pre 2015 when it was booming. The tier 1 oil service companies combined (as planned)to drip feed the work keeping the money at the top. It is decimated for the workers absolutely and I know. So your other industries rely on foreign workers? That’s problem in itself
9148 2018-05-22 07:22:47 それはヤってるな笑

9150 2018-05-22 07:22:32 When crude oil was $130/barrel the price of petrol was 70,At that time Modi used to say that as the price of petrol is increasing,the credibility of gov is declining
Now crude oil is $68 n petrol prices are 81 n more,
but now glory of country on its highest.

9157 2018-05-22 07:20:55 When UPA was in power, Modi criticized them for higher taxes on petroleum. Now he is shying away from it. He even increased the taxes when crude oil prices were too low. Either Modi was wrong at that time or now..

9306 2018-05-22 07:01:12 Crude oil price = $88/ Barrel (1 barrel = 2 kilometers × 88 = $176)
Refinery + Dealer Margin= {$34}×8%×12×8 
Ramadan cess of Gulf = $786×72 
Taxes = 75% Less than Nehru & Manmohan
Hence proved, international factors are responsible,Govt is doing the best. #FuelOnFire

9308 2018-05-22 07:00:54 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
9309 2018-05-22 07:00:52 Haha he doesn't have any contribution to make. oga went there to embezzled money to pay his debt, unfortunately for him no oil boom and stealing as usual. So you shouldn't expect any different from the man who went there for his own intention. He is not coming back for 2nd term
9310 2018-05-22 07:00:46 Stir together 4 cups hash browns with 4 cups dandelion greens. Mix in Olive Oil. Cut with butter. Serve over kale.
9311 2018-05-22 07:00:42 Have you seen the figures released by NBS? 
It grew at about 1.9% below all reasonable expectation...  Primarily as a result of the price of oil... Nothing to do with government policy. 

As a matter of fact It was further dragged down by poor non oil revenues

9314 2018-05-22 07:00:34 We do not have any voice when the petrol prices are increasing daily. We pay max tax, be it center/state or any department! What will happen when the oil touches $105/110 per barrel and the Rupee falls to Rs. 70/-? Lets wait & watch!
9315 2018-05-22 07:00:33 @vincecable Thank you for showing you support for tens of thousands of nurses, teachers, cleaners, doctors, oil&gas workers and IT support staff who are being threatened with a deeply unfair 20-year retrospective tax to cover up HMRCs own failings.

9316 2018-05-22 07:00:18 In 2012, crude oil price was more then 110$/barrel
Now its ard 80$/barrel
U dumbo bhakt.....
9317 2018-05-22 07:00:11 But oil and gas fired power plants won’t operate at a loss. They’re already under pricing pressure from renewables. Increasing fuel costs makes their situation worse.

9320 2018-05-22 06:59:42 RT if you want taxes on petrol to be cut down to zero until crude oil prices drop to normal. Government must take the responsibility. Citizens can't be paying for both price hikes and tax hikes. #petrolpricehike @narendramodi

9326 2018-05-22 06:58:24 2) Now Trump has agreed to reduce oil production, and rain oil $$, to combat Saudi deficit and pocket petri-dollars. Obama and Saudis flooded the market to reduce Russian oil revenues.

9330 2018-05-22 06:58:10 @arunjaitley had said that fuel prices weren't decreased when the international oil prices went down so that when the oil prices increase the govt will not pass on the burden to the public. What's happening now ? Finance ministry is just increasing middle class hatred towards bjp
9331 2018-05-22 06:58:04 When crude oil was $130/barrel the price of petrol was 70,At that time Modi used to say that as the price of petrol is increasing,the credibility of gov is declining
Now crude oil is $68 n petrol prices are 81 n more,
but now glory of country on its highest.

OMCs were left holding some dud certificates with which no banker was willing to lend! Imagine a Bond certified by Union not taken for funding!
9336 2018-05-22 06:57:16 I know and miss my patrons in the oil city too. The bottom line is money but we are working hard to enable us come. Do keep hope alive for us.

9343 2018-05-22 06:55:46 Here’s how: Any marine birds near an oil spill risk oiling and probable death. A major spill could result in one of the top bird mortality events ever caused by oil because of the exceptional abundance and diversity of birds in Burrard Inlet and in the Fraser Delta.

Creatures defends this oil price
9352 2018-05-22 06:54:53 He forgot another point. Centre govt has stake in oil companies. So profit, tax by these companies go to central govt only. It is indirect(?) benefit to central govt.
9353 2018-05-22 06:54:51 Most Asian stocks dipped in a holiday-hit trading session Tuesday, with the dollar and U.S. Treasuries little changed as crude oil held around its highest New York level since 2014.
9354 2018-05-22 06:54:40 2. and Govt. is watching the situation carefully.  When BJP was in election mode in Karnataka for 25 days petrol and diesel prices were stable and no increase.  Was the International price of crude oil at its low level so the prices here remained stable for this period?
9355 2018-05-22 06:54:36 #Mentha oil prices softened by 1.51 per cent to Rs 1,295 per kg in futures trade today as speculators trimmed positions, driven by tepid demand from consuming industries at the spot market

9369 2018-05-22 06:52:36 It's also not true the economy had already collapsed before he died.  With billions of oil money spent believing the gold rush would never end.  So when it did there was no money left, but continued to spend
9370 2018-05-22 06:52:27 Could you please also mention the price of crude oil in international market at that time??
9371 2018-05-22 06:52:00 Until quite recently, Canada was the biggest supplier of oil to the U.S. Canada increased supply to other markets overseas when the U.S. "adapted" environmental regulations to increase domestic production

9389 2018-05-22 06:48:36 Based on the Kinder Morgan’s past record, an oil spill is likely to happen at least once in four year, and the proposed pipeline will make oil spills more likely.
9390 2018-05-22 06:48:33 An independent Scotland would be viable with or without oil. The mis-portrayal of 2014 was that it was essential, when in fact it was billed as the cream on top.

9394 2018-05-22 06:48:18 Sir, problem is not increase in oil petrol price. problem is that when bjp was in opposition, they were crying, protesting, writing derogatory words about then prime minister. And now in same situation, they want to justify the price rise.
9395 2018-05-22 06:48:12 just a reminder on #crude #oil
The previous historical range (4 years 2010 to 2015) prior to the collapse was $85 to $115, so whilst $72 looks like a local high, the market is far from it's previous "norm".

9396 2018-05-22 06:47:56 Mr. @narendramodi sir .... Should we use vehicles or not?? You increase Petrol prices when there's an increase in Crude Oil price but then why don't you decrease petrol prices when there's decrease in Crude Oil prices?? @BJP4India

9398 2018-05-22 06:47:43 Last four years crude oil prices hit the rock bottom. Sadly we as citizens couldn't enjoy any benefit out of it. Now that the price is going up and up, we will have to bear the brunt of it. Highly paradoxical!
9399 2018-05-22 06:47:39 ...... but, but, but BBC Scotland reported Alistair Darling as saying the oil had all run out in 2014.

BBC Scotland reporting positively on Scotland's natural reserves runs counter to their unionist mindset. It simply does not happen.

9406 2018-05-22 06:46:47 It's immaterial. The objective during last 4 years was not merely collect a fair share based on prevailing prices but also 1) Compensate for Oil bond losses incurred by OMCs 2)Keep the consumption under check due to increased usage/buyers 3) Manage the FD on a/c of imports

9550 2018-05-22 06:23:07 Ok can you also tell us what was the status of balance sheets of oil PSU's during UPA? UPA never paid them the subsidies on time and they were on the brink of a collapse.
9551 2018-05-22 06:22:48 Great tweet! I like using the analogy of drilling for oil, because that makes it clear that sometimes the execution is easier (if the "oil is close to the ground") and the idea ("finding the oil") is hard, sometimes it's vice versa, and sometimes they're both hard.
9552 2018-05-22 06:22:33 Why times now so much about oil prices. Please note India needs huge improvement in infrastructure, rural economy improvement. Need more money, petroleum taxes is one form of sharing capital requirements. Don't create a negative perception please
9553 2018-05-22 06:22:33 @RichieFirth do me a big favour my friend John is stuck offshore due to bad fog on the rigs do a shout out for big John on the Mariner oil rig doing permits and tell to stop been such a miserable git 
9554 2018-05-22 06:22:27 Capturing Moscow would not have won the war in the East as the Soviets were prepared to evacuate the city and carry on if necessary. Germany lost against Russia because it failed to capture the oil it needed to carry out a mobile war on such a large area.

9557 2018-05-22 06:21:45 Big Secret: cook tofu in olive oil until a crust forms on two sides of the cube.  you can see it sneak down the side, just like when you cook chicken.  It should be about 10% of the way through on two sides.  This will give you Ultimate Tofu Texture and Taste.

9566 2018-05-22 06:20:33 Shampoo drys your hair. Do hot oil treatments once a month. Or deep condition. If you wear weave get a wig. Less tension on hair. And get a closure wig. Best protective style in the game rn

9585 2018-05-22 06:17:13 Well blame big oil for having our politicians in their back pocket. We could have done away with polluting oil burning vehicles 30yrs ago. We need to start charging people at patents office, and oil Co's for murder of inventors.

9636 2018-05-22 06:09:13 2014-2017 - Govt DID the right thing to cushion falling Oil prices with more taxes.
2018 - Now it can use that cushion to smoothen prices when oil is slowly rising.
#FuelOnFire
9637 2018-05-22 06:09:09 There is definitely a chance this could happen. One theory is this happens after a 12-24months period of strength where oil keeps rising, GDP goes ok in the world and central banks keep slowly hiking. This bursts the global bubble - than we go to downturn
9638 2018-05-22 06:08:52 Alam niyo ba kaninong administration nag simula ang oil exploration deal natin sa China noon 1986? kay Cory Aquino.. pero binaliwala ni Pnoy. Kaya galit ang China dahil hinde tumupad ang gov ng Pilipinas sa matagal ng kasunduan.

9644 2018-05-22 06:08:17 no here the oil minster is not responsible its the finance ministry which has to step in. My fundamental point is still this when you said its market regulated then why the hell did you do back door regulation by levying cess/excise etc

Else we pay taxes as well as fees
9653 2018-05-22 06:06:56 Sirji burden of tax is not on oil companies but on consumers. On the other hand subsidy affects companies since govt force them to sell oil cheaper than they have purchased.

9678 2018-05-22 06:03:20 I get the manufacturing oil off, give it a good once over. Take it down, add fresh oil. Run it empty a few times and then load up.
Also new magazines I load them then leave it for a day or so, so the spring tension isn't to tight to reload with out a speed loader.

9734 2018-05-22 05:56:16 shaved my legs and put neutrogena sesame oil on them and I am literally unsure that they’re still attached to my body bc theyre so smooth they don’t have friction with anythint
9735 2018-05-22 05:56:13 Only difference is that crude oil can still be refined......But.....Ashutosh....... Alas.....!!!!
9736 2018-05-22 05:56:13 We cut it into thinner strips and then press it between paper towels to get some of the moisture out, then marinate it for as long as possible to infuse flavor and then just put it in a skillet with some olive oil and viola!
9737 2018-05-22 05:56:07 So I was just wondering what happens when the coal runs out and the oil runs out and the earth is left with empty holes all over the place? And those wind farms are pretty ugly aren't they? No where near as picturesque as an empty coal mine!
9738 2018-05-22 05:56:03 Brazil did that and was a huge mistake. Oil demand will surge and pollution will become a huge problem
9739 2018-05-22 05:56:01 It’s already centrally planned but seriously Soviet Union is also centrally planned and the best output they can reach via friendship pipeline is 1/4 MBPD.
Which means they have to export more 3/5 of their oil via sea route.
9740 2018-05-22 05:55:51 Compare it with Crude oil prices..Then u will understand...

9784 2018-05-22 05:49:42 Not necessarily. Refiners in the US have good nargins because of cheap oil not because they run their refinery to maximise the product margin like the rest of the world has to. This is because they cannot produce middle distillates due to the dumbbell Crudes they run.
9785 2018-05-22 05:49:32 Nah 9.1 MBPD net imports And Russia oil production is ~5MBPD and ~25% of that already go to China.

9790 2018-05-22 05:48:51 Santions are 4th generation warfare, they've killed more people than nuclear bombs, ergo, the US has always been active in fighting to control Venezuela's resources, they control the scarcity, their trade, oil prices... and they won't stop until the colonization is completed.
9791 2018-05-22 05:48:48 Not denying that renewables don't have side benefits, but 1 you haven't listed is less dependence on Saudi oil. In fact I think this is one of the main objectives for the west, but they knew they'd have to use scare tactics to wean us off fossil fuel, and that's what they've done
9792 2018-05-22 05:48:46 #FuelOnFire I remember @SushmaSwaraj and all BJP leaders used to attack Congress for fuel prices when crude oil was at very high price. This govt has gone too far with it, increasing prices every month. @dpradhanbjp hasn't been able to keep prices under control.
9793 2018-05-22 05:48:34 So Iran produces 5% of the worlds oil and NZ is predicting we will pay $3 a litre at the pump ($2 litre currently).
A 50% increase.
Given how much of an impact global warming is already having, what is the breaking point?

I'm trying to focus on facts, fit this new info into what I know, and build an opinion based on facts.
9810 2018-05-22 05:46:30 Only oil company have control to fix the price for fuel based on international crude oil market then why till Karanataka elections price not increased on daily basis? Now we understood who is real controller. Increase price is not meaning of country growth!!

9827 2018-05-22 05:44:47 The strategy is simple. Good flow from China though Alberta all the way to NY city, and from the east all the way to the far east. No Alberta Oil? Guess what. Bring the entire supply chain of North America to a grinding halt. Stop all shipments going through Alberta.
9828 2018-05-22 05:44:43 Crude oil price = $88/ Barrel (1 barrel = 2 kilometers × 88 = $176)

Refinery + Dealer Margin= {$34}×8%×12×8 

Ramadan cess of Gulf = $786×72 

Taxes = 75% Less than Nehru & Manmohan

9834 2018-05-22 05:43:44 Yeah, it's a thing.

It's got less oil than hard soap, and has a texture a bit like sand with a little more wax feel.

It is INCREDIBLE.

The boats had it when I was in school and I wish I could get it for the house.

9850 2018-05-22 05:38:46 I doubt "flat-earth-ism" is really very prevalent.
And climate-change denialism is a phenomenon mostly confined to the english-speaking world (even then mostly the usa, with spill-over into britain canada australia) reflecting the interests of (funding by) transnational oil corps
9851 2018-05-22 05:38:26 It comes down to leverage and I suspect BC needs AB’s oil and fuel more (considering 60%+ of our petroleum based needs are from AB). $2-$3 gas plus fuels shortages would get Horgan’s attention. Remember polls say more BCers support TMX than not.

It also happens in winter due to the rise in demand for heating oil. Keep up.

9893 2018-05-22 05:31:26 #FuelOnFire is because Saudis are artificially increasing oil price through artificial production cuts through OPEC cartel. And like fools we outrage on our Central Govt and State Govts asking them to cut taxes.

9925 2018-05-22 05:26:39 I wanna do some home made masks like Coconut oil or avocado mask or something..
9926 2018-05-22 05:26:37 Please share the debts to be paid to the oil companies by the govt before 2014 and after 2014 to till date.
9927 2018-05-22 05:26:31 What can I say ...

They have brand spankin’ new colour-co-ordinated kayaks. 

Those of us who want a strong economy, STILL dont yet have in place a good enuf strategy to get our nation’s most important export (READ: OIL) to overseas markets.

HARD. WORK. AHEAD. 
9928 2018-05-22 05:26:26 Make a strategy to reduce oil prices that will make the difference......
9929 2018-05-22 05:26:10 The interesting thing about religious leaders is that their followers are so sold on the effectiveness of the snake oil that any attempt to persuade them otherwise is seen as the work of the Devil to undermine the “prophet”
9930 2018-05-22 05:25:47 I had to change cafes because the place I used to go now sells vape oil. Their entire shop reeks, and the cups reek, and I reek if I go there. I can't be alone in ditching them -- I wonder if they're earning more or less.

9934 2018-05-22 05:24:56 There is no such thing as sustainable palm oil, not unless the area is returned to it's original state and we know that doesn't happen. #deforestation #palmoil #WestPapua
9935 2018-05-22 05:24:53 Pompeo is not a diplomat. People don't change overnight just by giving them new jobs. Scott Pruitt is still and Oil Company lobbyist. Rex Tillerson never stopped being an insular, private executive. What did you expect?

9941 2018-05-22 05:24:21 Who can I call to make gas cheaper because I’m ready to drill the fucking oil myself damn
9942 2018-05-22 05:24:08 this is so tragic. charlatans not only exploiting someone's health and wellbeing for profit, but then paying the ultimate price. the government needs to do more to protect people against these health providers who use pseudoscience to sell snake oil.
9943 2018-05-22 05:23:57 do u put castor oil on them?
9944 2018-05-22 05:23:42 The statistics would have been much better if you had posted the rates with their respective crude oil prices. Otherwise those statistics can only be considered as a piece of crap to fool the common man.
9945 2018-05-22 05:23:37 強そう…
9946 2018-05-22 05:23:25 do you have rubbing alcohol, baby oil or vegetable oil? You can flush it out and oil or alcohol should kill it before it can get agitated

9953 2018-05-22 05:21:22 you have barely an nytimes understanding of Venezuelan economics.  what is the second most important component of it aside from oil? who controls oil prices?
9954 2018-05-22 05:21:17 Russia will have to double their oil output & direct it all to the China and multiply Sino-Russians pipeline capacity it by a factor of 15 for that.
That’s going to take a looooong time.

9956 2018-05-22 05:21:09 I think they understand just fine. They simply don't care because of the viral #greed which the #oil industry infects their employees with to ensure loyalty. As long as it's someone else's financial devastation, #FossilFuel industry employees are ok with destruction of nature.
9957 2018-05-22 05:20:52 Oh that's the worst!! The CBD oil really helped me with that. Are you still taking it?
9958 2018-05-22 05:20:48 i think it just means you need an oil change soon
9959 2018-05-22 05:20:37 Either they have to open a oil window where RBI would temporarily make USD available to OMCs   and or float oil bonds. There seems to be ostrich like attitude leaving everything with heavens . CEA is supposed to suggest.Not to be seen ..
9960 2018-05-22 05:20:28 have u had an oil change any time soon i know some cars do that after reaching a certain amount of miles
9961 2018-05-22 05:20:19 Obviously after poaching they need to be dry before contact with the oil or fat.

9969 2018-05-22 05:18:51 Try reading world economics papers. Oil demand is at an all time high and is increasing. Renewables are a long ways from being viable and useful
9970 2018-05-22 05:18:43 Shoutout to Mr. Lavelle for puttin niggas on to bread with olive oil
9971 2018-05-22 05:18:21 His fingers furiously danced along the vial of blackberry-scented oil.
9972 2018-05-22 05:18:06 Because Our Government Taxes us and Represents the Oil Companies. Only we do not have Representation.  Once again we have Taxation Without Representation. We have in 200 years gone Full Circle YES Taxation Without Representation.
9973 2018-05-22 05:17:59 Well if you’re saying about Sino-Russians pipeline the capacity is only 600.000 BPD that’s minuscule compared to people Republic 9.1 MBPD net oil imports.
And that assumes Russia can fill that net imports.
Their oil export is ~5MBPD
9974 2018-05-22 05:17:42 Even emerging economies like Brazil, SA, Indonesia, Thailand, show less than 5% of per capita income per day spent on one litre of petrol/diesel. Simply because their  per capita is 3 times ours and oil price half ours.
9975 2018-05-22 05:17:40 England wants to hugely limit immigration- its how it sold brexit to its voters. Many of our industries wouldn't cope with the loss of EU workers. Aberdeen is not decimated. Oil i$80 a barrel + rising. There have been vast areas of oil found since 2014. We are viable without oil.

9985 2018-05-22 05:16:20 You have to be shitting me, right? I’m saying that the Chavez/maduro regime chose not to diversify their economy when the price was high and they were benefiting —something that is inherently logical when running a country (or even maintain&update their oil related technology)

10005 2018-05-22 05:12:57 I think as a journalist you should do the analysis of % price rise in each of the 4 years earlier vs now. Large part of it would be due to global oil price but still that would be worthy of an analysis rather than being subjective as usual
