50 2018-06-11 20:49:02 Commodities are for everyone.
51 2018-06-11 20:40:24 I would be really interested in seeing some modeling of a BCA which only affected a small number of industrial commodities, as you suggest.
52 2018-06-11 20:31:15 That seems like it would become a strong driver of leakage. If high-GHG commodities are subject to a border adjustment, but the products made with such commodities are not, seems like big advantage to make products outside the state.
53 2018-06-11 20:28:13 no, they protect EU industries at Africa's expense - especially true for value-add in agriculture - they want to keep Africa stuck doing the cheaper commodities while Europe does the stuff that makes more money
54 2018-06-11 20:24:13 Because we're all so much better off producing low value commodities!
55 2018-06-11 20:21:58 Trump does not know about the commodities market.  That is a market for the Heartland. Not for an East Coast Stock Market guy.
56 2018-06-11 20:18:01 of fiat hyperinflation. If this happens, there will eventually come a point of equilibrium where the upside of investing in Bitcoin is no longer there and the main reason to buy it is simply to store value against other commodities or fiat currencies that have a ranging supply.

65 2018-06-11 19:46:28 The US has run persistent deficits for decades yet their bonds have experienced a bull market of a lifetime, even relative to commodities.  So much for the math guarantee.
66 2018-06-11 19:45:05 This statement is so loaded with assumptions and fallacies, none of them supported with data.   Creditors don’t stockpile treasuries for future commodity needs.   They trade real goods and services for those commodities. They stockpile USTs bc they run CA balances.

69 2018-06-11 19:31:03 You keep hyping our farmers but they will be the ones that pay the price for your tariffs on steel and aluminum from countries that trade these commodities fairly with us (European Union, Canada, Mexico).  China is laughing at you.
70 2018-06-11 19:30:41 Yet Canada boasts of a 20+- surplus; I know that Canada cheats on softwood lumber and agricultural commodities are mostly supply managed. Maybe do more research before you hurl accusations
71 2018-06-11 19:25:32 @RealRickRule What does it mean for #Commodities, #mining, #metals & #Exploration companies if #USA and it's allies are happy to trade economic sanctions on metals?

73 2018-06-11 19:12:09 if Canada can't export commodities, US won't be able to obtain $26B surplus from Canada in interest and dividends to US and $13B surplus from Canada for services. It is a very large cross-border trade with complicated ecosystem, which is essentially in balance.
74 2018-06-11 19:08:37 US does NOT have current account deficit with Canada. "Trade deal" includes operation of subsidiaries. US corporations and services operate more freely in Canada than anywhere and generate huge US surplus in services, interest & dividends. Canada pays by exporting commodities.
75 2018-06-11 19:06:16 O/N Wrap:
Equities skewed mildly to the positive, as are commodities, after market took the G6+1 debacle in stride; focus now turns to Singapore summit, though if G6+1 is anything to go by, potential for market-movement is likely limited.
76 2018-06-11 18:55:45 In March-2018, gas prices in St. Louis were definitely lower than Wisconsin. In Sep-2017, mangoes were more affordable (and flavourful) in Myrtle Beach. Closer to source or higher tax/duties? #Commodities #marketing #taxes
77 2018-06-11 18:53:27 While I was in the Navy on Whidbey Island I had a girlfriend in Vancouver. Every weekend we would go to Point Bob for Gas, liquor and assorted cheaper commodities.  It was a regular event for many Canadians.
78 2018-06-11 18:49:43 Then after Mr. Hotmail starts to think: "Airbnb does not any have commodities, Uber does not have any cars and they worth billions.. Hmm I think I'm missing something"
79 2018-06-11 18:35:33 Highly valuable? Like a car or a house? So how much for the men or are they worthless? Women are not commodity, the concept of bride price is a bad practice that has taught men like you that women are commodities to be paid for. Like other bad practices before it, it should stop.

85 2018-06-11 18:02:11 If you look at it in regards to the tariffs in relation to our low dollar our steel becomes the same cost as "American" steel and aluminum is still cheaper than made in US aluminum I believe like oil price of these commodities is in US dollar
86 2018-06-11 18:01:53 Haha, that's all we get with most commodities. Do you trust ratings agencies? Any understanding of Q-ratio and why it's a thing?

88 2018-06-11 17:56:50 Cryptoassets like ETH are not commodities, gas  is commodity, ETH is a security-like stake in the Ethereum mainnet.

Commodities’ prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, not based on the execution or traction/adoption.
89 2018-06-11 17:56:29 They have gone over from CFD’s to actually owning the tokens december 2017. I believe you own CFD when utilizing 2:1 leverage, although they do not longer offer leverage on cryptos. They are also regulated by the CySEC as a real exchange offering commodities and some stocks. 1/2
90 2018-06-11 17:56:22 Eso se dejó de hacer desde la suba del precio de los commodities en 2008.
Y no eran simples pagos directos en efectivo, en eso incluyen promoción de exportación, q básicamente son swaps a los países q les compran granos a ellos.

91 2018-06-11 17:51:45 So what you're saying is that holdings actually have to be, y'know, staked. The diminished liquidity is the costly commitment to the network's security. You're also mistaken to compare these to shares/dividends - these are commodities, remember? They're CDs, not shares!

Lastly Africa as a whole has a void in manufacturing & processing. We export raw commodities & import finished goods. It's not sustainable. FDI can assist with capital & tech

98 2018-06-11 17:31:35 The introduction of ssp 500 note will hike up commodities again and then ssp1000 will come into circulation. My projection is that-without change in leadership our economy is going Zimbabwe way.

100 2018-06-11 17:22:58 I agree with the not a short term venture part. However, reserves do deplete...and it is one of the hardest commodities to replace reserves regularly. That is the tough part with the long term. Not impossible...just tough.
101 2018-06-11 17:20:09 Raising the animals and caring for them but NOT killing them or treating them like commodities!!

102 2018-06-11 17:18:33 I don't know. Is volume simply the number of shipping containers. How relevant is volume if what we export is increasingly miniaturised high value components - but we what we import is increasingly bulky low value commodities?
103 2018-06-11 17:15:52 One of those is a commodity, the other is a service. Commodities are subject to cost deflation orders of magnitude more than services. Shitty causal claim to push a preferred narrative.
104 2018-06-11 17:09:00 More manufacturing with same S-I would probably mean more imports of industrial commodities, for example
105 2018-06-11 17:02:26 Scalability as a technical issue is simply  memory, servers and bandwidth, commodities.  Scalability within units is already from <3,000 patient practices to >30,000, not a problem.  The limit on speed of dissemination is all in the mind.
106 2018-06-11 17:00:33 #tariffs   Because the parties are eeejitz, the tariff thing will get ugly before it is resolved. There will be some temporarily higher prices in a limited number of commodities.

109 2018-06-11 16:51:24 You realize this is going to make commodities more expensive for people already not making enough to pay for them, right? But you don't care.
110 2018-06-11 16:50:48 33%increase on us steel prices 25%tarrifs on imported steel.... just 2018 alone and only halfway through the year... do you see the problem? #usasteel #steel #Commodities
111 2018-06-11 16:43:17 The market for iron ore, like all commodities, goes up and down. Right now, it is low. This is the wrong time to sell our shared inheritance of minerals. Logically, we should wait for higher prices before mining!
112 2018-06-11 16:40:13 Are MOCs as responsive to regional economic actors in the logrolling past, or has this been replaced by national level donors that are ideologically nonprotectionist, in part because their fortunes tied to finance, where returns driven by a national basket of commodities?

114 2018-06-11 16:36:47 If North Korea is going to become westernized by importing our cheapest and lowest quality commodities, it might as well give Dennis an hour on the DPRK channel, KCTV.

116 2018-06-11 16:21:56 For example, I don't think LCA can, in the foreseeable future, develop GHG scores for the entire slate of commodities and consumer products which enter CA (or any other jurisdiction) for the purposes of border adjustments. Too many necessary assumptions.

121 2018-06-11 16:04:59 I love, love commodities right is.  Cheap, positive carry, positive skewness, uncorrelated, etc etc etc.   What more can you want from an asset class?
122 2018-06-11 16:01:32 There are indexes based on market sectors, such as tech, healthcare, financial; foreign markets; market cap (micro-, small-, mid-, large-, and mega-cap); asset type (small-growth, large-growth, etc.); and commodities.
123 2018-06-11 15:55:44 That was their import from USA but for export their profit replaces their loss in buying US commodities, Trump says they are robbing the USA in that manner and it is going to stop. I agree Canada must stop using America, no nation is getting better from Canada if came from USA.
124 2018-06-11 15:55:01 You are aware that food is made from raw commodities, correct? This includes man specialty crops such as fruits and vegetables which are, in your words, food. 
125 2018-06-11 15:51:17 @RepKinzinger because the trade Commodities probably have changed quite a bit since it was established but to outright lie about oscal judging the u.s. is very unfair especially for a president whose word obviously is taken verbatim by his group
126 2018-06-11 15:50:34 @RepKinzinger Free Trade Agreement was set up to benefit both parties not goudge one or the other set up based on Commodities that were being traded at the time to take advantage of savings on these items tweaking is probably required...

131 2018-06-11 15:31:24 Drama. Don't mis lead people. In the wake of reasonable prices of commodities, petrol, diesel cost must be ignored. In Congress regime, commodities were too high.
So it is political propaganda of Congress, which must be ignored.
132 2018-06-11 15:27:33 Those subsidies allow US commodities to be dumped on foreign markets at lower prices.
133 2018-06-11 15:21:52 Many inexperienced people can easily be misled into unwise expensive trading strategies that benefit their promoters? To be fair this is almost as true for stocks as it is for commodities.

137 2018-06-11 15:15:26 It's what they did in retaliation...the USA put a steel tariff out....it wasn't politically strategic. China, Canada, EU looked at electoral map, identified commodities that could hurt tRump base voters & where they are produced. Boom

143 2018-06-11 15:08:55 Absolutely true.
They would rather see us burn to a crisp in preference to watching us forge ahead as a viable independent nation.
They have a fraction of our resources & a huge population, hungry for commodities.
They've been accustomed to pillaging our reserves for little cost.
144 2018-06-11 14:52:35 Peanuts was an example out of the air. Over the average both Canada and the EU charge us higher tariffs on all the high volume big money commodities. That is the facts. If you want to focus on one example where they don’t, be my guest. She is on the site. She can see them.
145 2018-06-11 14:49:33 Look it up on the WTO website for the big commodities. It takes a bit of time to navigate the site. Use the downloads section. I am not making these numbers up.
146 2018-06-11 14:48:08 Those stats are like BLM manipulated stats. Yes overall between all of the EU and Canada’s trading partners they have lower overall Tarrifs, Canada being the lowest. That number is an average. When it comes to the US we pay both higher tariffs on all the big commodities.
147 2018-06-11 14:48:07 Paul, honest question, how long can Russia  sustain all the dollars they are spending worldwide? I wonder if the contracts for Russian Commodities were analyzed for ROI if the world could see cash flows? There must be some work on this?

150 2018-06-11 14:40:56 My perspective is more pragmatic; men must be enfranchised. Families, careers and social standing used to do this. But these are becoming scarce commodities. Disenfranchised men would burn the world. We are getting close to enough of them to get this done.
151 2018-06-11 14:40:26 To my ladies bragging about how many men want them remember that the cheapest commodities attract most customers..
152 2018-06-11 14:39:58 Tell me where modi is successful. He hiked petrol prices common man's gas cylinder is 800. Where is ram Mandir. Where is the black money from Swiss. How much of Ganges is cleaned. Why Essential commodities prices are rising do u call this is ache din.
153 2018-06-11 14:39:38 I realize we trade commodities back and forth, my point is that she says she supports ALL Alberta jobs, yet this is not supported by the phase out of coal power here while supporting shipping thermal coal overseas, this is in fact the opposite of supporting Alberta jobs

155 2018-06-11 14:31:14 But surely increasing the amount of base money would shift the supply curve for endogenous money, thereby raising the inflation rate (in the short-to-medium run), whatever the specifics of the non-monetary market for monetary commodities.

164 2018-06-11 13:50:38 Those commodities are mispriced bc of the US inability to control its spending (UST issuance) which results in a mathematical guarantee that UST's must lose significant value on real basis v. commodities going forward just for the US to avoid nominal default on those UST's.
165 2018-06-11 13:49:38 The USD system is maintained in no small part via ctrl of commodities thru a USD-derivative system; creditors are supposed to stkpile UST's as savings for future commodity needs.

174 2018-06-11 13:33:13 Tax cuts and buybacks. It will come crashing down within a year. This is all sugar rush, there is hidden inflation on commodities, and we are overdue a recession.
175 2018-06-11 13:30:34 cause they sell high margin "commodities"
176 2018-06-11 13:27:23 As if you like to pay more for food, gas, commodities? That is what is coming down the pike my dear! Living over 60's years has taught many of us many things. TARIFF WARS ONLY HURT AMERICANS! 

It will not hurt him in the least since he doesn't have to pay for anything! 

Thanx
177 2018-06-11 13:24:52 Yah! That is why I am stocking my freezers to the hilt because change is coming where people will not be able to buy gas, food, pay rent, pay utilities and all the other commodities we need to live. Thanx for starting the Trade War. Guess what? We have to buy steel from others.

180 2018-06-11 13:16:58 Sadly, the government has promulgated countermeasures for the poor families w/c was not effectively implemented & dghan paman factors i.consider esp. that train would impose only an immaterial price increase on the basic commodities as compared to other factors of inflation.
181 2018-06-11 13:16:21 So Tax ( Amendment) Bill 2018 is imposing taxes in essential commodities and @UKenyatta is preaching about the Big4Agenda? You are making life unbearable for ordinary citizens. Who is advising this administration?

183 2018-06-11 13:14:35 Do you even know what a subsidy is? That’s where they pay the farmers the money they lose by NOT planting so the government can regulate the cost of the commodities. Wheat sugar soy  ect ect.

206 2018-06-11 11:39:46 Cyril increased VAT to 14%, which has increased the prices of commodities. This 14% increment has led to other industries increasing their prices in order to maximise profits. It's simple economics. Ke o thuma mina wa lena.

216 2018-06-11 11:05:33 Look, dude, sorry but you need to just read up on economics in general. We really can't get along on our own - no country can. Lots of commodities or products are either cheaper to mine, grow, process or make abroad. We wouldn't be able to afford a lot of what we now buy cheaply.
217 2018-06-11 11:04:38 Here's the deal though. What is going to happen the the goods produced here including farm commodities that there isn't any longer an outside market for? It will glut our market driving prices so low it will force farmers out of business.

246 2018-06-11 07:34:35 I agree. The concept of sharing & capitalism with a heart might be too much dissonance for US in our current selfish profit driven mindset ideology, where WE the people are commodities. 2018 years ago there was this radical socialist that believed WE needed to care & share

248 2018-06-11 07:29:34 We welcome any increase in the daily wage of our ordinary workers but this amount certainly doesnt commensurate with increasing prices of basic commodities. smh
249 2018-06-11 07:25:06 I think the problem in society, shown literally by you 2, is that commodities are seen only as cool when they are expensive
250 2018-06-11 07:20:15 Why is @realDonaldTrump fighting the trade war backwards?  He should be pressuring China to open their markets up to innovative American companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook instead of punishing Canadians for offering to sell inexpensive commodities to our manufacturers!
251 2018-06-11 07:19:11 Historically, even in the US, women have been commodities. Her “value” absolutely was tied to her virginity & yes, her hymen was inspected. If she was raped, her value was nothing, in spite of being the victim.

264 2018-06-11 05:54:16 6. Our foreign policy is not subject to principles but is driven by differences that divide our colonies. I find it strange that buyers of commodities can form a cartel but producers actively compete against each other. Wouldn't we be served better as a unified entity?
265 2018-06-11 05:51:34 our trade policies are as if we are Dubai. India has trade embargo on 100s of commodities. Our markets are flooded with cheap Chinese shit instead of carefully controlling it like India in favour of local industry.

285 2018-06-11 03:45:38 Yes we need to focus on Russia but we also need to realize that everyone needs to drop surplus talk.  The true issue is the tariffs.  Tariffs are set because countries set them to protect industries or commodities. Why wouldn’t G7 take DT offer of no tariffs across the board?
