Stocks are held by less than 50% of the American public, and 80% of that stock value is held by 20% of that 50%.

More people working is not the issue if their health care and cost of living expenses outpace income.

9 2018-03-20 23:56:40 Nobody ever said that any one thing would end all mass shootings. Raising the age may stop a few. Better background checks would stop some. Ending the gun show loophole would stop a few. Banning assault weapons, bump stocks and big magazines would eliminate more. Stop lying.

54 2018-03-20 23:41:21 Is the Ruger capable of being modified with bump stocks?  If yes, then get rid of it too!  How many shots does it take for a fearsome hunter to kill an unarmed herbivore?
55 2018-03-20 23:40:54 Huh,I went over to FB & my timeline is back to normal. All my news sources had been removed from my feed for a few months. Back again yesterday. Too bad they waited until their stocks went South. Too bad that Marky played w/elections. #Zuckerberg is going down a few notches!

58 2018-03-20 23:40:00 You have just inspired me to invest in stocks and to pursue my deep passion for art that i’ve supressed for years because I didn’t think it was for me. Thank you lord sparda, senpai-san.
59 2018-03-20 23:39:56 The value of the Facebook stocks already dropped 60 billion, which is more than the entire value of Uber.
60 2018-03-20 23:37:53 Feeling conflicted about the referendum on banning bump stocks today b/c it included language to “strengthen penalties” on illegal traffickers and I feel like that’s code for locking up more POC. Thoughts, twitter? #twill #vote #IllinoisPrimary
61 2018-03-20 23:37:37 I remember him promoting scam penny stocks on stocktwist  what a loser.

Stocks are the return on investment from the output of a company.
As for gold and silver I'm with you on that they only have their industrial value actually.
Extreme intrinsic value they've achieved is simply because fools like shiny
72 2018-03-20 23:27:46 He dumped his own stocks for God sakes
73 2018-03-20 23:27:22 What about #guns? Tom Paine calling for AR ban and limiting clips. @ralphbaxterwv wants background checks stronger. @KendraHFershee talking of freedom from fear and banning bump stocks and no weapons of war. Also fund research on guns!
74 2018-03-20 23:26:56 @owenjhill Last time I checked, fully auto weapons were hard to get because... they're not legal. 

But you claimed bump stocks should be legal b/c there was no hope of controlling them.

With people like you in charge, you're correct. 

There will likely be blood on your hands.
75 2018-03-20 23:26:15 Feels bad so many great companies being damaged by the hacks. Stocks plummeting glad to see some rebounding.

76 2018-03-20 23:26:10 Is that still illegal with this admin? After Icahn’s pre-tarriff dumping of steel stocks, he probably thought it was no problem.
77 2018-03-20 23:25:54 Fourth quarter earnings season has been outstanding, with domestic large-cap stocks up 17 % (same quarter) and sales growth up 7%. Earnings drive stock values. This is a good sign. Pay attention to earnings.

79 2018-03-20 23:25:24 Sell your Facebook stocks. Follow Zuckerberg lead.
80 2018-03-20 23:24:59 selling more stocks
81 2018-03-20 23:24:26 So nobody wants to ban semi auto rifles? We might trade bump stocks for that in perpetuity..
82 2018-03-20 23:24:12 And the stock market is made up of my retirement funds, I have stocks and bonds. I’m losing money and it’s trump’s fault  He says and does stupid shit, the market is going to crash if he doesn’t Get Out!
83 2018-03-20 23:24:11 So Vivendi are handing all stocks back to Ubisoft. Okay, how is that really a good thing? The reason that they were doing that in the first place was to keep the company afloat.
84 2018-03-20 23:24:05 So Zuckerberg started selling off FB stocks on 2/14.
The day of the Parkland tragedy.
Hmmmm!
85 2018-03-20 23:23:04 It's a Ponzi scheme.
You buy it but it's only value is that you've bought it.
Unlike other stocks companies produce something sell something have an income, kryptos only income is other people putting in their money.
Who pays the coin miners.?

86 2018-03-20 23:22:53 I think the stocks were from mixo's exclusive pack
87 2018-03-20 23:22:22 You don’t have to be wealthy to invest or receive advice about it. If you don’t have a plan for retirement then you’re doing something wrong. And on another note, i saved to invest only $500 in stocks when i was 18 years old. Much reward as i wait it out.
88 2018-03-20 23:22:00 Trump claimed the stocks PROVE the economy is doing better so NO the stocks DO NOT prove this.
89 2018-03-20 23:21:47 PM Mkt Wrap: Hard on rates, the benchmark bond closed lower 22bps to end the day @ $102.09. Stocks ended higher after yesterday’s plunge. The DowJ gained 116.36 to close at 24,737.27.

93 2018-03-20 23:19:59 Choppy trade continues this week with the #ASX 200 +0.4% or +25pts on the open to 5962. Mining & energy stocks lifting most (after falling most on Tue). $MYR up 4% post 1H results #ausbiz
94 2018-03-20 23:19:49 Then you benefited from income on its Endowment Funds. Such funds typically invest in top grade stocks and shares (like Banks) and use part or all of its income therefrom in funding the University's programs. You have been a beneficiary of such funds.

97 2018-03-20 23:19:31 Is pumping always a negative connotation?
98 2018-03-20 23:19:05 Why is it that if you live below the poverty line and have a junky old house, you pay taxes on it, but if you have a billion in stocks, you pay nothing?  Why does Yale not pay any property taxes?  Cambridge is a poor city where people struggle to keep up their taxes, but not Yale
99 2018-03-20 23:18:55 Why do you think that? Who do you think are users? Better question - what are the most held stocks...

if you don’t have the stomach for a 10% dip, maybe you should be buying bonds.
103 2018-03-20 23:15:48 Wow just saw @OurBigLoveStory tonight & it was incredible! So powerful, funny & moving. Filled with themes such as LGBT, class, religion, race &more.

105 2018-03-20 23:13:18 Best way ever to let fish stocks boom is let Brits fish as much as they like and ban all others for a period of time...
106 2018-03-20 23:12:44 Toys R Us is officially closing all of its stores, Dropbox is going public, & marijuana stocks are growing astronomically. 

What does this mean to you?
107 2018-03-20 23:12:14 @Tony_Burke and @JoshFrydenberg our reef still reels from bleaching & fish stocks affected by shipping. The Gvt plan must be scrapped to protect this fragile living organism. Australians will hold you accountable at the next election.
108 2018-03-20 23:12:03 OK, maybe you'll just have a big net that that goes round UK and stops fishies swimming to find food, spawn etc. Fish stocks are mobile and precarious and can't be treated as purely national resources.
109 2018-03-20 23:10:16 actin like you got fb stocks...
110 2018-03-20 23:08:39 Folding stocks and other modifications for concealability don't help, either. Neither does the pistol grip on the AR and other MSRs. But yeah, limit loads to 5+1 and you'd see far fewer mass shootings.
111 2018-03-20 23:08:22 Why going bananas about one stock FB? Stupidity investing in individual stocks. Only an idiot will do that! Invest in large portfolios! SPY! ACWI! EEM, EFA! So on! Concentration sucks even if it doesn't suck for Cramer who makes a living on individual stocks!

123 2018-03-20 23:03:27 I didn’t think understanding stocks would be so simple. if you have enough start up cash, making money on stocks is one of the easiest ways to generate income.
124 2018-03-20 23:01:58 Sell ALL of your Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and Google stocks. LET your voice be heard by hitting their pocketbooks.
125 2018-03-20 23:01:46 You legally can not buy a military grade weapon. Our military does not use an AR15. We use m16's. They look alike that's the only reason you don't like them. And you can thank Obama for bump stocks. He approved the sale of them. While the NRA condemned the sale of them
126 2018-03-20 23:01:04 @TheBeatWithAri THERE IS MONEY ON THE LINE W/ZUCKERBERG & FACEBOOK!!! LOSS OF $9 BILLION IN STOCKS, CONGRESS COULD PLACE HUGE RESTRICTIONS & PERHAPS OTHER PENALTIES!

139 2018-03-20 22:53:18 Your ignorance is defined in your own statement. Bump stocks do not turn rifles into automatic weapons!! It still requires 1 trigger pull per shot fired!!! It’s better to be ingnorant in silence than prove your ignorance by opening your mouth!!!

145 2018-03-20 22:52:20 Im amazed how stupid and greedy GOP  are  They choose NRA money over others lives Thats what drives these votes NOT 2nd amendment. It does not include semi automatic, automatic weapons bump stocks. VOTE THEM ALL OUT 2018
146 2018-03-20 22:52:19 Oh no, fish don't recognise territorial waters. 3 years ago, the UK mackerel stocks moved north to Norway to feed as UK suffered warmer seas. If we stick to rigid UK only quotas in UK waters, we'll lose our export market

148 2018-03-20 22:50:26 You didn't answer my question, isn't that what bump stocks are for?  Seriously I'm not against guns, my mom once got a sawed off shotgun as a Xmas present from my dad
149 2018-03-20 22:50:14 Ask them how many tradesmen have been made redundant since the council house stocks reduced. Often the answer is none. Some back office functions have 3+ times the staff a similar dept in the private sector would have. Then there's the ongoing provision of final salary pensions.

This is not a pump, that is for sure!  This is a long term play and now is a very good time to buy if you want your investment to do well.

173 2018-03-20 22:31:17 Stocks have been falling in February, but consumers keep getting more confident. That seems like it should be a sell signal from a contrarian point of view, but it has not been. Stocks have rallied almost every time after seeing a price decline with high and rising confidence.

In a time correction, sacred cows, no brainers, popular stocks get unpleasant surprises..normal and healthy..
179 2018-03-20 22:28:50 Your answer is in the question idiot. “Long gun” for use at longer ranges. Front grips and shoulder stocks to increase precision, not so they can “mow down” anyone. Less recoil.

182 2018-03-20 22:26:27 As much as the idea of only allowing scottish ships to fish scottish waters sounds nice economically,  I'm not sure I trust scottish fishermen to regulate themselves and protect fish stocks. Something the EU has been a godsend at.  #BrexitShambles #Brexit #fishing

184 2018-03-20 22:25:28 @MarkAmodeiNV2 I believe bump stocks should be banned, the minimum age should be raised, and Congress not already asking should get off their f—ing asses and do something about gun control.

190 2018-03-20 22:21:59 Contraband doesn't stop existing once it is Illegal, you can bump fire weapons without bump stocks, there are no online purchases from FFL's without back ground checks. Virginia tech was worse than Parkland, and was solely handguns. Bad people do bad things with or without laws.
191 2018-03-20 22:21:36 Yes, I hear stocks are now recovering in some areas, but some others are still in trouble. At one time there were pretty much no fish in the Bay of Biscay, mostly due to overfishing by the Spanish. They would plunder our waters too given half a chance.

202 2018-03-20 22:12:05 Every one of the deadliest mass shooters in history was a law-abiding gun owner until they weren't. Ban the means by which they became the deadliest mass shooters: AR15 type weapons, extended magazines, bump stocks, online purchases without background checks.

221 2018-03-20 22:00:28 Being able to buy an AR-15 isn’t rational. Or bump stocks.
222 2018-03-20 22:00:18 Stocks, in my opinion, are the best assets around. That said, they are not “digital assets” like crypto. Stocks mark fractional ownership in physical operating businesses. One’s shares can be held digitally, but the actual asset is the company represented by the shares.
223 2018-03-20 21:59:45 We want a list of every single Republican that voted against banning bump stocks!  Can you guess why?

241 2018-03-20 21:50:14 You two chuckleheads are obtuse:  mass shooters don't usually plan to live long enough to worry about long term damage to their weapons; whatever immediate damage Paddock anticipated was mitigated by bringing extras.

Banning bump stocks is a small, but useful step.

261 2018-03-20 21:36:45 Bitcoin offers an alternative to what HAD only been the “stocks, bonds, real estate” investment options. Millenials are choosing to take the bitcoin alternative because they are priced out of real estate and don’t trust stocks and bonds.
262 2018-03-20 21:36:13 Efforts are paying off where #Facebook will be #INVESTIGATED and pay heavily for turning on the people. #Stocks dropped drastically #yesterday...What a way to hit their pockets. It was a good roll in the hay for moment but it was a season and time to move on. It's poetic.
263 2018-03-20 21:36:05 They can't used Stocks against disabled people. This is abusive.
264 2018-03-20 21:35:59 @realDonaldTrump Publicly Ask how many reporters sold their Facebook stocks before they broke the story on Monday. Should they be looked at for insider trading?
265 2018-03-20 21:34:39 I was making the same mistakes.... Got way to excited on the idea of making money. I wasn't allowing the stocks to move and small moves to support were causing me to get out way early!

282 2018-03-20 21:28:26 Can’t decide what strategy to have for this stock. Partly had same issue with $EMH when it was its volatile best. 

Now have to contend with two of the mustang stocks.....
283 2018-03-20 21:28:00 No it won't solve the situation, but it could serve as a pretty good deterrent. Along with that we should ban bump stocks and get a gun restraining order system up and running.

290 2018-03-20 21:22:42 Isn't that what bump stocks are for? To convert
291 2018-03-20 21:22:40 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
292 2018-03-20 21:22:11 You mean Dumbocrats are lying and it isn't "common sense?" Couldnt they have stopped this by banning bump stocks? And raising the age to legally buy a rifle from 18 to 21???

296 2018-03-20 21:20:31 What does she want them to do? Ban bump stocks? Raise the age to buy a rifle from 18 to 21? That would've stopped this shooting HOW exactly?

323 2018-03-20 21:04:09 Let them take it all the way up. When Federal Courts & Supreme Courts tell them bump stocks are not within their (perceived) “right” maybe they will finally STFU about these “accessories”.

339 2018-03-20 21:01:11 It's possible that this bull market will match the 80s-90s bull market and continue for another decade. But it's a lot more likely that it will be over within 2-3 years. 2018 is the year to move out of growth stocks and into value stocks to protect your assets in a bear market.

355 2018-03-20 20:52:21 totally agree!  But in my opinion NRA pushes back against any common ground.  They don't want bump stocks illegal; they don't want private sale loophole closed; they don't want CDC to research gun violence.   Their interest is not "gun rights" its "gun makers".

367 2018-03-20 20:46:31 I think raising the limit on assault riffles & making it more difficult to buy the guns MIGHt have made an impact.  Also the Vegas shooter used bump stocks & if he hadn't used them more people might have been saved.

385 2018-03-20 20:38:12 The rising rates will be even worse for gold.
Not sure if anyone can follow your logic.

On one hand u r saying that they will not be able to up the rates and all should buy gold and silver

In a separate message you are saying that the rate will go up and it is bad for stocks
386 2018-03-20 20:38:01 I don’t own a gun. I am fine with banning bump stocks and making guns harder to get. I think the world would be better without guns. But I’m not such a dumbass as to say the good guy couldn’t have killed the bad guy because of having a different gun
387 2018-03-20 20:37:39 Bro it didn’t drop much just 1.75% whereas some stocks lost 10%. It’s not sinking as yet!!!!! I am wishing and hoping it will go up to the Mars!!!!!!!! I’ll just wait for that day!!!!!!
388 2018-03-20 20:34:49 The vicious circle: Investor preferences determine prices and in turn prices determine investor preferences. Looking for absolutes in either one of those two is naive. It's all relative and circular. #stocks #investing

395 2018-03-20 20:31:15 But by late 1980s, the giant Japanese monetary bubble burst. Everything crashed. Stocks. Property. The economy itself. Three decades later it has yet to recover. Japan is a classic example that the good times NEVER last forever. Now, it is USA's turn. And it is going to get ugly.
396 2018-03-20 20:31:04 ... usually the gun of choice. Also I think that a ban on bump stocks or fully automatic type modifications would be good. As well as better background checks and mental health evaluations. But you are definitely right about raising kids to have a respect and understanding of...

406 2018-03-20 20:27:29 "How big will be Russia's wheat carryover stocks"?  

2/ The rate of wheat disappearance from March through June is likely  to be higher than last season due to strong exports: 12.5-13.0 vs 11.6mmt.
Given that Russia's ending stocks at 01/07/18 might be estimated at 13.5-14.5 mmt

427 2018-03-20 20:18:25 "How big will be Russia's wheat carryover stocks"?  
Additional remarks.
1/ There are some unaccounted wheat stocks at small farms. To my mind they will account for some 10% of grand total wheat stocks. So you may add about 1.5 mmt.
428 2018-03-20 20:18:18 When I trade I’m wrong often but I take trades that have the right reward to risk ratio. I don’t put to much weight on any one trade rather look at it over 100 trades or 1000 trades of that same set up. When stocks break the 200d ma I don’t care for them $fb. @option_snipper

447 2018-03-20 20:11:03 Bump stocks are junk. Any marksman will tell you that the moment you begin automatic fire is the moment your accuracy goes to shit. The recoil of the round forces the barrel up and you have to fight to hold it down and be somewhat accurate towards a target.

515 2018-03-20 19:47:32 Have a look at the Scottish fishing industry in the late 60s/early 70s, then ask yourself why fish stocks still haven't recovered to anything like these levels. The last people on God's earth who should decide fishing quotas are Scottish fishermen. Their greed killed Mallaig.

518 2018-03-20 19:45:47 @SpeakerRyan How many deaths will it take before you stand up to the NRA and quit being greedy for their money.  No assault weapons, no bumps stocks, waiting periods, cannot purchase a gun until 21, and checks for mental stability.

526 2018-03-20 19:42:19 Valuation is likely the killer. Attempts to try to raise prices and make better profit margins, may reveal to the public that the "moat" is not there in the business. During dotcom bubble, high rev growth stocks, once they started trying to show profits, collapsed quickly.
527 2018-03-20 19:42:07 The biggest achievement of the Common Fisheries Policy is controlling over fishing and allowing stocks to recover. Thus keeping fishing going. Many of the problems with the policy arise from how the UK allocates its quota - forcing small operators to the wall
528 2018-03-20 19:42:01 Why don’t you tell people how Corps. are using over 60% of their tax cuts to buy back stocks. & under 15% going to wagers.

627 2018-03-20 18:59:02 are Facebook & Twitter stocks a bit like crypto currencies - highly vulnerable to tough regulatory intervention?
628 2018-03-20 18:58:04 I wasn’t, although I will point out bumper stocks can turn a semi automatic into a fully automatic so they should be banned, also handguns were banned in the uk 22 years ago and we haven’t had a school shooting since, also I asked because you disclosed you had a semi automatic
629 2018-03-20 18:57:20 I just heard Rush Limbaugh state that the agenda of all Liberals is to ban every gun.  I know a lot of Liberals and can’t say even one of them wants all guns banned.  They want tighter regulations and only a ban on semi automatics and bump stocks.

It lures us by offering upto 50% discount on some of stocks which doesnt deserved rise in last rally. Those type of stocks may take longer time to get back to original levels. 

Look for those which are still not falling.
646 2018-03-20 18:50:37 Germany stocks higher at close of trade; #DAX up 0.74%.  U.K. stocks higher at close of trade; $FTSE100 up 0.31%
647 2018-03-20 18:50:23 Yep, guard who was trained encountered untrained individual with a pistol, not an AR 15 with bump stocks. Big difference. It's like journalism compared to what you do.
648 2018-03-20 18:49:52 France stocks higher at close of trade; #CAC 40 up 0.57%. Spain stocks higher at close of trade; #IBEX 35 up 0.18%
649 2018-03-20 18:49:19 Buying support levels off technicals in the best stocks is not the same as catching falling knives.
650 2018-03-20 18:48:22 A bubble happens when investors pile in to buy something and push its price far higher than it should be, often on the assumption that someone else will buy it for even more. Past bubbles include Japanese stocks during the 1980s and tech stocks around 2000. #APStyleChat

652 2018-03-20 18:47:23 If I look at the indices I can't believe that there are so many strong #stocks out there! This is definitely a market of stocks :)
653 2018-03-20 18:47:10 Now if they just start to buy the oil stocks!
654 2018-03-20 18:46:10 why? in an enclosed space a handgun is preferable that's why with long guns in those conditions some people will put on folding or retractable stocks. Stick around you just might learn something. Sounds like that RO acted on his training and engaged the shooter per protocol
655 2018-03-20 18:45:54 A bull market happens when stocks climb at least 20 percent from a low. The current bull market began in March 2009, when the S&P 500 hit bottom following the financial crisis. This is the second-longest bull market since World War II. #APStyleChat
656 2018-03-20 18:45:18 A bear market for stocks is one where prices drop at least 20 percent. They can happen quickly, in the span of months, or they can take years. Many professional investors use the S&P 500 as their barometer for when the market has turned from bull to bear. #APStyleChat
657 2018-03-20 18:44:41 Terrific breakout $SHOP  #46 overall. Best Stocks Now App. No current position.
658 2018-03-20 18:44:18 are there any good stocks you recommend now?
659 2018-03-20 18:43:58 Oil up almost 2%. The trading day is basically over and oil stocks just stuck in the mud like usual. So much fun. $XOP $OIH
660 2018-03-20 18:43:49 Keep it low. What will happen to the Twitter stocks??
661 2018-03-20 18:43:46 Like industrial stocks more than tech test of week. $XLI $DE $HD for example
662 2018-03-20 18:42:49 What's your take on the infamous $SX and $IDK stocks?
663 2018-03-20 18:42:19 If we are payiing down debts then the stock market is climbing . this makes good sense.. it is not happening ..  This is not a good time to buy stocks .. if we cannot pay down debt, then higher interest rates is the only way to encourage you to do so..  You cannot keep thinking
664 2018-03-20 18:41:46 why did they wait so long to release a gnomeo and Juliet sequel. the kids who saw it are teenagers now. they waited too long and now the net value is stale. the market is dead. stocks are plummeting and the streets are on fire
665 2018-03-20 18:41:32 One thing that happened is I sold all my FB stocks & closed my FB account. Also sold all my Google stock! Surely I’m not only one that sees these stocks tumbling. Sold last week before sell off!
666 2018-03-20 18:41:23 #blockchain #crypto stocks are looking pretty good..... This is a warning, better be buying or adding :)
667 2018-03-20 18:41:04 Well that’s just absurd, you’d think that is the only plausible conclusion. If a type of gun was banned, it would leave hundreds of other types/styles. Bump stocks is an accessory. Stricter laws to get a gun. All hassles but NON repeal the 2nd Amendment. It’s an Amendment “amend”

672 2018-03-20 18:40:29 Well I've had shares for a while so I'm just waiting... out of all the penny stocks I've had for some reason I won't sell this one and I believe in this stock I don't know why but I do know one thing It has very little debt
673 2018-03-20 18:40:01 It would be an utter dereliction of duty for May to even consider bargaining over our territorial waters with regard to fishing.  The EU has plundered our stocks while she and the rest have stood by and watched them do it. An absolute DISGRACE.
674 2018-03-20 18:39:52 Buy and hold style works on a very few stocks which is very hard to pick .Time is against you. the stock market always time you!!
675 2018-03-20 18:39:44 Contrary to overt risk in bio, there always no/little risk stocks trading under cash or near cash value. Some still have hope either for r-merger or pipeline turnaround. For example, $VSAR is under net cash value; $DERM is a couple of dollars above cash w/ likely FDA approval.
676 2018-03-20 18:39:11 It’s all about money for them. That’s it. Expose them, target the money, start boycotting, make their stocks fall. The weapons made in the US are sent to every corner of the world, and add to other nations gun violence and wars. Vote out the ones who serve the money over people.
677 2018-03-20 18:38:14 The marijuana industry will be over a 21 billion dollar growth by 2021 the farmers gave up on you and the way you have treated them since your so called presidency I'm glad I invested in marijuana stocks
678 2018-03-20 18:37:59 agreed. So much easier to be contrarian in stocks ... if EUR were SPX it would have collapsed by now
679 2018-03-20 18:37:58 i know stocks like TAL can keep going higher and higher so I can even buy right now but what you think? Same apply to BZUN.
680 2018-03-20 18:37:46 Yes, and, fun fact: we actually DO have gun control laws in the USA. It has worked. It does work. And it will work better w/ a ban on assault rifles, bump-stocks, large mags, etc.

Arming more people isn't the solution to gun violence. Its the @NRA's solution to selling more guns
681 2018-03-20 18:37:07 Do they have easy public access to AK-15s, bump stocks & high capacity magazines?
682 2018-03-20 18:37:01 Stocks... always- Cash is king right now
683 2018-03-20 18:36:28 I am in the investment biz & I would never, under any circumstances, purchase FB stock! Not when I've got over 10,000 other stocks to choose from.

684 2018-03-20 18:36:14 The standard model for fisheries economics shows that free entry reduces stocks to an unsustainable level. Fishing needs controls.

686 2018-03-20 18:35:09 Look at the list of jobs lost. After getting all the billions in tax breaks, the big corps shareholders are happy as pigs in muck. Corps are buying stocks back. Demand not there so no expansion. Turn off fox.

688 2018-03-20 18:34:24 Indexes measure groups of stocks or other investments to give a sense of how the broader market is doing. The S&P 500 covers Apple and 499 other behemoth companies, for example. Other indexes cover small U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, the bond market and other niches. #APStyleChat
689 2018-03-20 18:34:14 NOOOOOO, my Google and Facebook stocks! Please DOOOOON'T!!!!
690 2018-03-20 18:33:53 Transparent companies keep proper stocks so that users can buy their products. It has been more than a month for the notes but still can't purchase. Who knows how many units you keep for flash sales.
691 2018-03-20 18:33:18 Depends on a final deal. I suspect a City deal will trump fish and outside the CFP the SSF will be able to butcher stocks without restraint.
692 2018-03-20 18:33:14 I’m ready!  I’ve purchased stocks in Tissues, YouTube Red and Twitter.  And I’m ready to cry and laugh and be amazed by how hard you work. We love  you!

694 2018-03-20 18:32:18 There are 7 bills dealing with guns on today’s Judiciary calendar. Bills to allow guns in airports, bills that lower the penalty to carry without a permit, bills to expand concealed carry. Unfortunately, my bill to ban bump stocks remains off the list. #HearTheBill #banbumpstocks

696 2018-03-20 18:31:34 Stocks are priced in dollars and cents, but indexes are not. 
For example, the S&P 500 moves by 1.50 or 15 points, rather than by $1.50 or $15. #APStyleChat

703 2018-03-20 18:28:14 It holds up just fine? Possible 5million members get fancy magazine and some classes. Look at NRA and what they lobby for and against. How they sue states like Florida for changing laws. Say against bump stocks then not. The membership part is a farce.
704 2018-03-20 18:28:04 I mean I've watched hbox pop off on someone he's SUPPOSED to beat, WHILE he's up 2 stocks, closing the game with up throw rest, that's all I need to see tbh lmaoooo

707 2018-03-20 18:27:16 I just saw an article talking about how here in Mass where I'm from some small amount (maybe even as low as 4 if i remember correctly) turned in their bump stocks after the ban....and id venture to imagine as u could too there's wayyyyyy more out there. So hows that ban working?
708 2018-03-20 18:26:40 Stocks is what it is or money of course. I'm glad I don't watch Fox news because they are Russian republicans.
709 2018-03-20 18:26:30 Yeah it makes sense. I'm seeing #BOO as much bigger in 5 years time and I'm OK with riding it out - frustrating but other Stocks are doing well for me and taking up the running.

713 2018-03-20 18:24:12 Ha! And then the proletarian woke up one morning in 2008 and discovered that his 401k was gone and he was laid off because his employer was going out of business and now his stocks were worthless because the whole unstable house of cards had collapsed.

724 2018-03-20 18:18:24 Im being patient. We will see how they will cover the 35M plus stocks that are short. Again, this wont end well for the “jonny come lately” short (retail). Institutional shorts know they have no reason to cover until material news hits

743 2018-03-20 18:08:50 Republicans Are being very pig-headed here! Bump stocks are not for hunting deer or the like, they are for killing humans. The British are NOT coming. We don't need a militia. I own a rifle and it's for hunting. #banbumpstocks @SenCoryGardner @BennetForCO

757 2018-03-20 18:01:44 As long as you think all the hikes happen 18-19 then they’re correct price. If you feel economy may not be so perfect or stocks crash well then they’re a bit too cheap. Up to you to decide
758 2018-03-20 18:01:27 Does he mean stocks like Telephone which is down nearly 10% on the year but hey i get that 5% div?

776 2018-03-20 17:56:24 I've been trading forex futures stocks and options for years and they have been stealing from me this whole time!! Please help me file.
777 2018-03-20 17:56:15 Interesting idea.

“We can manage our fish stocks better and more sustainably than anybody else. And to prove it we’re going to kill some fish and throw them back in the water”.
778 2018-03-20 17:56:06 My uncomfortable truth is that picking stocks seems preposterously easy (you should not try to pick stocks)
779 2018-03-20 17:55:56 Name one mass shooting that involved the modification of an AR-15 to be fully automatic (tip: bump stocks don’t do this. They only help you hit the trigger really fast by “bumping” the gun into your finger).
780 2018-03-20 17:55:44 Traders watching stocks which at present are calm but most waiting for the FOMC meeting tomorrow evening now. Having said that, the dollar remains bid...
781 2018-03-20 17:55:44 IIRC their crypto solution charges a spread, which is basically a hidden commission. For stocks, I believe they share their order book with larger funds for a fee. Either way, the consumer pays a price.
782 2018-03-20 17:55:37 Traders watching stocks which at present are calm but most waiting for the FOMC meeting tomorrow evening now. Having said that, the dollar remains bid.
783 2018-03-20 17:55:05 US stocks stray the session on a positive note but may be restricted by the fact the FOMC meeting kicks off today and concludes tomorrow..
784 2018-03-20 17:55:04 I hear ya. It’s like saving in your 401k. If you keep buying stocks that go to zero doesn’t mean you can stop investing. It’s just a lot less fun.
785 2018-03-20 17:54:57 US stocks stray the session on a positive note but may be restricted by the fact the FOMC meeting kicks off today and concludes tomorrow

787 2018-03-20 17:54:19 Hmmm very interesting.  I never factored that thought in.  I guess that would be considered a full sponsorship for that company since it affects your stocks.
788 2018-03-20 17:54:18 At the bank the investment guys always got the stocks channel on but I wanna tiptoe over there & sneaky switch it to rock of love

791 2018-03-20 17:53:23 I was always excited by stocks but you are correct. Crypto is going to become more widely accepted.

794 2018-03-20 17:52:24 Icahn gives the best reasons for buying stocks, "I believe Newell itself is undervalued and that's why I bought it." He's merely playing poker and not showing his hand.

797 2018-03-20 17:51:28 Shooter in Vegas was not a criminal. Guns were legal. Including the frigging Bump Stocks.

604 Americans KILLED or WOUNDED or INJURED by 1 frigging noncriminal with frigging legal guns in 8 frigging minutes.

Time to change that, wouldn't you agree?
798 2018-03-20 17:50:56 There's a scene in The Hurricane Heist where the badass meteorologist character reveals he stocks his government issued Batman tumbler with a week's worth of unrefrigerated peanut butter sandwiches
799 2018-03-20 17:50:45 Today we have witnessed one of the worst day in Stocks, USD clipping up to 115PKR. A significant raise of 5 Rs in a day. This will further increases our debt return burden, and further now down ordinary people. U r not leaving Heavens even.@geonews_urdu @HamidMirPAK

802 2018-03-20 17:49:03 Having availability of assault weapons & bump stocks makes it far easier to a) kill and b) get away. You just love your guns too much don't you? I think you may be a nut

805 2018-03-20 17:46:59 It was recognised in 2013 that fish stocks were recovering and cfp was not harming them but aiding recovery. It was a while ago but the recovery has not reversed. BBC news has articles on it
806 2018-03-20 17:46:35 The EU take 80% of the UK’s fishing stocks, then sell it back to us
807 2018-03-20 17:45:44 However, the anti-gunners want to statistically tie any one shooting with the narrative of the day:
AR-15, Bump-Stocks, Large Magazines, Assault Weapons, Machine Guns, NRA...ad infinitum
808 2018-03-20 17:45:43 SO I guess we just remove the F from FANG stocks and make it angst now
809 2018-03-20 17:45:39 Illinois referenda today: legalizing weed, addressing opioids, ACA funding, banning bump stocks. Go vote!
810 2018-03-20 17:45:24 I wanna visit Limaland (¼ dirt) & Waynesfield (⅓ dirt) a few times. They always run stocks, modifieds, and the big winged sprints are my favorites.
811 2018-03-20 17:45:16 I also think I saw a story that #LyinRyan recently sold some stock before a problem became public too, but dont hold me to that. I need to check #InsiderTrading is it me? Why are ppl in #congress who make legislation decisions abt economic concerns allowed to own stocks?

3 - Patiently waiting for this phase to end. #CashIsKing #PitchIntheDirt
814 2018-03-20 17:44:14 You can ban the stocks, but you can’t stop people from being able to bumpfire.
815 2018-03-20 17:44:08 Honestly agree so much. I can never buy clothes in store because no where stocks size 4 without it being in the petite section and bc I’m 5ft7 that doesn’t work for me so I always have to order skirts/trousers/dresses online or risk spending more money getting things taken in

818 2018-03-20 17:43:03 Yesterday in Colorado: State senators @owenjhill, @VickiMarble and @JerrySonnenberg voted AGAINST legislation to ban bump stocks. Colorado voters, hold them accountable at the polls and VOTE THEM OUT. #NeverAgain #GunReformNow

822 2018-03-20 17:40:46 School shooting in Maryland. 17 year old boy shot by Sao. 16 year old girl in critical condition. 14 year old boy shot.  Smh.
In Mississippi  a 9 year old boy shot his sister in black of the head over game. What are bump stocks and age limits are going to do about that.
823 2018-03-20 17:39:57 LOL, I only took funny stocks as clips my guy. Your Diddy gave me hands
824 2018-03-20 17:39:19 I swear being lied to is the most annoying thing on earth. Next time you should probably have a better cover story & watch your steps so I might actually believe it

827 2018-03-20 17:38:15 I get really mad when ppl with a lot of money just waste it... like dude invest, stocks, start a business. Why you tryna be working under someone your whole life & someone you don’t like at that.
828 2018-03-20 17:37:57 There has to be something to fight against, you cannot fight against 90% societal conformism. You can argue against it, you can shout against the darkness, which we do. But you can’t fight it Until the standard of living stocks dropping precipitously
829 2018-03-20 17:37:34 Gov. Larry Hogan asked if he's happy with president and Congress on gun control and he says NO, that's why he moved forward with his own program. (Money for school security, ban on bump stocks, red flag legislation)
830 2018-03-20 17:37:34 Like, what are returns on stocks? A buck a share after waiting days?
831 2018-03-20 17:36:57 I read Zuckerberg unloaded a large number of stocks prior to the tragic fall.  Is it possible he had inside knowledge?
832 2018-03-20 17:36:53 “Assault weapon” is a subjective term that means different things to different people. The difference between an AR-15 and a “traditional” hunting rifle is that the AR is easier to clean and maintain and you can get custom stocks/grips to make it more comfortable to different...
833 2018-03-20 17:36:15 Surely using that logic if you listen and still like the stock you can just wait for the inevitable placing. I usually appreciate his reasons for buying stocks but his circumstances are different to everyone elses
834 2018-03-20 17:36:14 @DDS_DocHoliday @GaryNTrader - Can anyone confirm that #Pwc are actively selling stocks from #Beaufort clients accounts and returning cash instead of shares? This is to get the clients to pay for the services as Beaufort are broke. Sounds odd/off. Funds should be segregated?
835 2018-03-20 17:36:07 I am a gun owner, but I would like to see the following:                       
Ban on bump stocks.              Tighten background checks for the sale of all guns.      Limited number of rounds.    Required gun handling & safety course. National 21 age requirement for all guns.
836 2018-03-20 17:36:06 Well you are obviously a financial wiz who has invested all this “tax dodge money” in fantastic stocks which will have rocketed in value. That’s why HMRC didn’t bother to investigate for all these years and just rode their investment...

841 2018-03-20 17:33:34 I think there are things that can be done better.  I think we're working on passing legislation to ban bump stocks. But you have to pass a background check to get ARs. But if we can't even enforce the laws we have now, how can passing more help?
842 2018-03-20 17:33:30 Remember, the DOW is only 30 stocks. Easy to "move" that index.

844 2018-03-20 17:32:16 How about universal background checks? Ban high capacity magazines? Ban bump stocks? Gun registration? Ban semi-auto rifles? I’m not saying this will bring gun deaths to zero (or even close) but they are common sense measures that will save countless lives.
845 2018-03-20 17:30:49 Gamification is exactly how @RobinhoodApp was able to grow so quickly, long before #crypto came into their picture. No-fee trades on penny stocks created a habit; their main responsibility is providing a return for their shareholders, not consumers’ well-being.

862 2018-03-20 17:24:51 Let's face it the Canadians thought their fishermen could manage their fish stocks & fucked up big time with devastation of cod stocks because they ignored the scientists
863 2018-03-20 17:24:17 And one trigger pull and one shot never happened when that assault rifle the AR-15 was involved in any of the recent shootings by any stretch of the imagination. The AR-15 assault rifle also uses bump stocks in the commission of bloodshed just like the past few years.
864 2018-03-20 17:23:42 They better figure something out! Meanwhile stocks are dropping too
865 2018-03-20 17:22:05 Ban bump stocks and any clips holding more than three rounds. Develop less lethal ammo. 

Ok. Plus annual registration, coordination with law enforcement to spot problems, and require liability insurance for each weapon.

871 2018-03-20 17:18:31 Option 1 would be ideal but it hasn't worked, has it? But that's a separate issue to UK controlling its own waters. Fish don't recognise borders so of course UK must engage with other countries to ensure stocks are maintained. But we don't have to be in the EU to do this.

903 2018-03-20 17:04:15 I aim for one trip a month. More dirt than asphalt. Late models and/or sprint cars get me through the turnstiles, but it's usually the hobby stocks or modifieds that end up stealing the show.
904 2018-03-20 17:04:14 At midday, Mortgage Bond prices lower. Stocks holding gains. 10-yr yield 2.87%.

906 2018-03-20 17:03:27 It finally feels like a moment of ‘no turning back’ on gun violence in America. But in order to make real change happen – not just a ban on bump stocks, but outlawing the sale of AR-15s and assault weapons altogether – it’s going to take all of our voices speaking as one.
907 2018-03-20 17:02:39 As a general rule, equity is risky because stocks rise and fall, sometimes precipitously. Debt is safer because in order to lose your principal, the government or company that owes you would have to actually default on the loan.

909 2018-03-20 17:01:08 Does blue British blood go for a higher price? Presumably Brexiteers won't accept transplants of foreign blood, so diminishing stocks might pose a problem for them.

They are here not to offend us but are rather huge laughing stocks.
915 2018-03-20 16:58:35 Is it perhaps time to watch the stocks tank and just as they are about to start Rising buy as many as you can afford? Or is this the end of Facebook? I mean one can hope but I also would like to make money off them.

921 2018-03-20 16:56:38 I'll leave it to others to ascribe meaning...I just think of it more in the context of stocks more broadly, they seemed to be concerned about a possible breakout from the ~5Y range and may grow concerned again if this keeps rising.

960 2018-03-20 16:44:56 @SpeakerRyan STRICTER GUN CONTROL NECESSARY. Ban bump stocks, Ban military style weapons, Install universal background checks that includes reliable DO NOT SELL databases for previous violent offenders. Raise age to 21 to buy weapons. STAND UP. DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY.
961 2018-03-20 16:44:43 I'm sorry, positional in the sense I meant swing itself. I use to hold stocks not more than 10 to 15 days  the problem with swing is it correlates with the overall trend of the market and it is quite not possible to find stocks that move on their own, and I can't even short them

963 2018-03-20 16:44:08 Make a Dom. abuse conviction keep you from buying a gun.  Make high capacity mags illegal (to produce/own/sell).  Make any aftermarket attachment that increases weapons to near automatic fire illegal (i.e. bump stocks).  It's wont' end gun crime, but it will lessen it.

985 2018-03-20 16:35:43 I've been saying repeatedly, that the GOP won't be allowed by the NRA to do anything 'meaningful', after the Parkland shooting.  But eliminating bump-stocks, a meaningless gesture, I thought would be tolerated by their NRA masters...?  

Sorry, my bad !!!
986 2018-03-20 16:34:50 Ha Ha Ha, spoken like someone who gets their gun facts from cnn... Bumps stocks work as well as any other infomercial product... Hell, flexseal can fix your boat... GTFOH
987 2018-03-20 16:34:47 No protection officer uses high capacity mags (and if they did law enforcement has access/can have access to more restricted weapons).  School officers aren't using bump stocks.  Banning those 2 things wouldn't make schools less safe.
988 2018-03-20 16:34:36 No. Just go away from Facebook. It's game over. Stocks are collapsing and staying there is the most dangerous thing right now.
989 2018-03-20 16:34:14 There should be divergence as PSU stocks are for the people.  It's more of a service sector, profit is secondary.

994 2018-03-20 16:32:23 Exactly. It’s been almost 7 months since Vegas & they still haven’t even banned bump stocks.
995 2018-03-20 16:32:20 J'ai plus qu'à faire des stocks de mouchoirs alors !
996 2018-03-20 16:31:56 But bump stocks are still used so if their so inaccurate why not just ban it?
997 2018-03-20 16:31:29 DIFFERENCE: responsible gun owners recognize gravity of owning killing machine & danger of weapons in wrong hands. They lock up their guns, keep them from children, don't buy military style rifles, bump stocks.. NRA wants to sell as many possible without regard for human life.
998 2018-03-20 16:30:22 You can’t just tell everyone to be threatened and helpless at home...rifles without detachable stocks can’t be easily used, are we this crazy to think this is good to ban firearms....when crazy people happen to have them and others want to ban them for themselves?! This country h
999 2018-03-20 16:30:20 I agree. Nothing can be done. The US is so unique in the type of humans that live here we simply have to accept mass murders are part of the American Dream. If you get rid of bump stocks somebody will just kill 50 people and wound 500 with a knife.

What can you do?

1004 2018-03-20 16:29:43 omg good bye ily so much!!!
1005 2018-03-20 16:29:24 Totally agree. A lot of retail traders buy and trade what they use in their life and those are the FANG stocks mostly.
1006 2018-03-20 16:28:30 Don’t be afraid of the bounce/ or FOMC drift... its sell for stocks! Even mainstream commentary is getting skeptical. After that sell-off there will be plenty of opportunities to buy in April
1007 2018-03-20 16:28:29 dont think stocks have the dip in them today i guess, let'em rally and sell'em higher
1008 2018-03-20 16:28:17 La tengo hace un mes pero me daría pena salir de ella por una opa . Intentarán comprarla con una prima del 25-50% y de dejarla navegando sola eso lo podría subir en 3-6 meses
1009 2018-03-20 16:26:45 I agree there is no one weapon that shooters use, so a prohibition of certain weapons is not logical. Everything I do want to ban though makes it harder for a shooter to kill as quickly or easily. w/o bump stocks..Vegas shooter would not have been able to fire so many shots.
1010 2018-03-20 16:26:36 Time to sell all the Stocks of Facebook they lied to all of us just like CNN
1011 2018-03-20 16:26:24 Oil stocks definitely not confirming this move. If anything the stocks look close to breaking down from a head and shoulders pattern.

Yes tech stocks need to be more accountable & protect our data. No this not the end of Facebook. They’ll re-adjust, lick their wounds and reclaim their top position in tech. FB is too vital for businesses. A good buy opportunity here.

1033 2018-03-20 16:20:21 Tip of the day:  Stocks moving up or down on light volume relative to their float size is a good indication that someone may be trying to dump on chasers or clean up sellers.  Keep close tabs on volume in your stocks.  The key line here is "relative to their float size"
1034 2018-03-20 16:20:20 I’ve wondered how long this corporate Kabuki dance could continue. 

Both FarkBook & Twittipater Stocks are WAY overvalued, as they both seem to be tinkering with fringe tech to distract from their core businesses being one bad revelation away from being MySpaced.

1041 2018-03-20 16:17:53 Who told you you couldn’t arm yourself “lawfully” if we had sensible gun control? Not being able to illegally obtain guns or assault rifles with bump stocks too punishing for you to help reduce “senseless” gun deaths?

Now I need to understand what makes you add or remove stocks from the list! Also what are you scanning for your short ideas? Seems conter intuitive to look for shorts in the PEG list IMO.

But also have better background checks, add a waiting period so those background checks can but more Thurrell. BAN BUMP STOCKS AND HIGH Capacity magazines

1078 2018-03-20 16:04:34 I don't think any of them advocate wars like this in good faith, for the sake of democracy or whatever they claim. It's all about stealing resources, privatizing infrastructure,  opening markets to US/Western businesses, boosting defense stocks, and otherwise gaining power
1079 2018-03-20 16:04:10 And before it was bump stocks, it was high capacity magazines. Before that it was armor piercing bullets or hollow points. Before that it was Tec 9s & easily concealable handguns. Before that... (this is depressing.)

1096 2018-03-20 15:57:21 How do gun control advocates benefit when they've passed little to no meaningful regulation even in the wake of Sandy Hook? We couldn't even regulate bump stocks after Vegas. NRA lobby is the one sinking $$$ into politicians.
1097 2018-03-20 15:56:35 When stocks "crash" don't run. The actual goal is to buy them when the price is low to maximize returns.
1098 2018-03-20 15:56:17 Because they shoot faster and have more ammo? It's easy to make them fully automatic with bump stocks?

1110 2018-03-20 15:52:38 Just a heads up that if you pre-ordered the new Outdoor Photographer of the Year - Portfolio III book, the stocks have been held up in UK customs. They will be sent out as soon as they get to our warehouse. This is also why Amazon and other booksellers have not had stock yet.

1112 2018-03-20 15:52:15 $NDX 50-day = $6820

$SPX 100-day = $2689

TA suggests stocks are 'better' above those levels and 'broken' under those levels, which is why it should provide risk context vs. serving as an absolute catalyst.  In my experience, anyway.
1113 2018-03-20 15:51:55 $MULE What are similar stocks to $MULE that could be next to be acquired?
1114 2018-03-20 15:51:52 You forgot a few things, like EU countries with 50% youth unemployment, the destruction of UK fishing stocks & industry, quashing of democratic rights and the erosion of national legislative freedom and autonomy.
1115 2018-03-20 15:51:50 Sure, point taken. May I give you an example? Apple is asking its shareholders to donate Apple stocks and shares back to Apple for Apple to innovate a product that you bought from them in the first place. As a business man this seems to me not a solid business case

1117 2018-03-20 15:51:11 You're confusing me with someone else. Fisheries are very important, which is why fish stocks need careful management & fishermen need access to markets for their catch.
1118 2018-03-20 15:50:22 If ones intent was to lessen school shootings, & not just to sell more guns, theres lots of options. Renew assault weapon ban, universal background checks, magazine/clip capacity limits, ban bump stocks, limit age to 21 & up. Etc.

All popular w Americans. All opposed by the NRA.
1119 2018-03-20 15:49:36 I 100% agree with you on bump stocks. There already is uniform, or “universal“ background checks on new guns. On used guns, in theory, I agree, but implementation would be near impossible. I’m still looking for answers on how to implement that successfully.

Y ¿Cómo se cuantifica ese beneficio? Los manteros llevarán libros de ingresos y gastos, compras de mercaderías, stocks y demás, claro..
Por otro lado, además de a las marcas, esa venta perjudica a todo el que tenga una actividad legal y pague sus gastos y sus impuestos.
1159 2018-03-20 15:39:39 Not sure who your referring to but I seem to have the problem of selling winners to early. But I'm working on it. Trying to buy "Can Slim" type stocks as I seem to lose money on the lesser quality ones..
1160 2018-03-20 15:39:36 So, if I understand aright, GB fishing was regulated because stocks were getting low; GB CHOSE to go in with EU's agreement because it was cheaper. Right?
1161 2018-03-20 15:39:29 Hey mr. president, can you tweet something +ve to improve stocks market condition 
1162 2018-03-20 15:39:26 You missed my point, they have banned high-capacity magazines but people are still getting them just like they'll still get bump stocks, so you're fooling yourself.

1168 2018-03-20 15:37:06 @owenjhill Hey asshole, how about you stop putting CO citizens at risk to prop up the NRA? It's corrupt morons like you that are getting kids killed every day. There is absolutely no need for bump stocks or larger magazine sizes, you disgusting monster.
1169 2018-03-20 15:36:24 21 of 30 $DJIA stocks trending positive.
1170 2018-03-20 15:36:02 Such stocks will not make money on the short term But in the long term will give very good returns 
I suggest buying this stock after listing on any weakness
1171 2018-03-20 15:35:51 With the Cambridge Analytica stocks plummeting, I wonder what they’ll charge to promote my Etsy now? I mean, it wouldn’t hurt to ask right...?
1172 2018-03-20 15:34:29 A lot of chatter about $LG thought I’d give my 2 cents. When the marijuana sector heats up and mj stocks start running $LG will also inevitably run, but long term I don’t see much there because of some questionable deals I think they’ve made.
1173 2018-03-20 15:33:46 1000% convinced we will be MUCH higher soon enough. 
Holding onto one hidden gem is best for my personal investment strategy, as I don't have it in me to swing trade a bunch of dif stocks anymore. Buy & hold $VFFIF will prove worth the patience IMO.

1181 2018-03-20 15:30:50 Wow. We banned bump stocks here in Mass. They should be banned everywhere. There is absolutely NO reason anyone needs one. They are for killing not hunting.

1187 2018-03-20 15:28:18 Im saying stop making laws to shit that isn't the problem. Why ban ARs and bump stocks when the government clearly isn't capable of taking care of us.
1188 2018-03-20 15:27:54 @marcorubio@MiamiHerald the red flags are with u and ur office for not banning bump stocks and assault rifles.Why give the police more to do

They just want to create fake demands and want to pump their numbers that's it. Within a month they will settle down

1202 2018-03-20 15:22:20 Colorado State Legislators just defeated (on a party line vote) a ban on "bump stocks." 

This has nothing to do with hunting or sport shooting since bump stocks destroy the accuracy of aiming a weapon in favor of assault-style spraying of ammunition...!!

1225 2018-03-20 15:15:36 I have stocks. I also have basic search engines. The Dow has not recovered from the January plummet, and it's been long enough to assume that the trend has vanished. Meanwhile, job creation has been lagging and companies are going under left and right.

By wanting to ban bump stocks? By wanting to ban the type of gun most commonly used in mass shootings? How?

1260 2018-03-20 15:06:18 The thing to watch here IMHO is how long the dip lasts. Historically, stocks recover from breaches quickly. If, however, investors are pricing in the risk of US and other governments enacting regulations that hurt FB’s long term bottom line, the dip could be long lived.

1291 2018-03-20 14:57:01 It’s the first day of Spring, @NYSComptroller. Good day to divest NYS pensions from fossil fuel stocks. Not an easy process but one that should be started today!

1293 2018-03-20 14:55:52 the number of people using bump stocks is minimal...... legislators just wasting time on frivolous matters
1294 2018-03-20 14:55:30 Hi Kate, the closest store to you that stocks this is Wath-upon-dearne Extra, which is showing this is about 5 miles from the Rotherham Extra store.  Thanks - Ross
1295 2018-03-20 14:54:33 Obama scandal, on L Ingraham, new book " secret empire" Schweitzer.

Obama regulators crush companies, PHX  University. No DOD student loans.

Stock drops to peanuts. 100 to 4 bucks.

Obama buddy Nesbit buys stock for nothing.

Regulators change mind and stocks shoot up. Big$$$
1296 2018-03-20 14:54:26 Yes, it happens all the time. Stocks under SEC investigation can go up and many times do go up until action is taken. It can take years for the SEC to determine fraud.
1297 2018-03-20 14:53:39 Guests on @CNBC are talking about something called the "Fed Drift" today. The idea? Stocks tend to drift higher heading into policy meetings on the hope the Fed might say something touchy feely to make people happy and buy stocks.

1305 2018-03-20 14:48:04 Thanks to management of fish stocks by EU Britain we still have fish Orcan fish. This ‘raiding’ of fish is propaganda.
1306 2018-03-20 14:47:45 So if I get what you are trying to say guns fire one bullet per trigger pull and bump stocks changes this & allows the shooter to hold the trigger and rapidly shoot many bullets with one trigger pull. Is this correct
1307 2018-03-20 14:47:23 Stop limit is like when you have to stop your loss or stop your profit when you have purchased a crypto or stocks as the market also has this feature, it helps cutting losses and helps having profit while trading.
1308 2018-03-20 14:46:46 I need to get back into stocks
1309 2018-03-20 14:46:22 Oh god yeah. Plus everyone getting high on their own overvalued stocks. There are no rules! It will never crash! Our paradigm is not subject to 3 laws of thermodynamics!
1310 2018-03-20 14:46:19 But you will never do anything positive. Work to legislate - No silencers, no bump stocks, no cop killer rounds, no super shooter magazines, comprehensive background checks, and NO countrywide concealed carry reciprocity. Work for those, and don't take $ from NRA.

1312 2018-03-20 14:46:00 I voted for #brexit for the following reasons:-
1/ Make our own rules & return sovereignty to the UK
2/ Control our borders and our money
3/ Control the fish stocks and fishing rights
4/ Ensure the law makers are accountable
This interim deal is just plain wrong @Jacob_Rees_Mogg

1315 2018-03-20 14:45:19 I just heard that Facebook is loosing accounts and stocks are falling, but I see my friends are all here. Maybe it's a stock I can now afford to purchase. 
1316 2018-03-20 14:45:01 Bump stocks are gimmicky things that I don't support the use of. If you truly want to understand firearms, the simplest way is to understand that semi-auto means one trigger pull = one bullet. This is true for rifles, sidearms, shotguns, etc. ANY weapon can be used in an assault
1317 2018-03-20 14:44:55 Remember when Trump said he was banning bump stocks? How's that coming along?
1318 2018-03-20 14:44:43 Fair enough, but I can slightly disagree by saying that we have no need for fully automatic weapons and bump stocks (I can further on bump stocks if you would like), but semi-automatic weapons for self-defense and hunting are alright.
1319 2018-03-20 14:44:30 1. Ban bump stocks
2. Owning multi-shot weapons require training/license
3. Owning military-style weapons w/ high capacity mags = additional license/training
4. Close gunshow loophole
5. Convictions of violent crimes = revoked gun rights 

(1 of 2)
1320 2018-03-20 14:43:36 It was a 2014 reform which introduced a greater role for the EP. CFP still much criticised as a methodology for controlling stocks as very centralised and non compliant with the principle of subsidiarity.
1321 2018-03-20 14:43:15 When are JShah & MShah going to blame their parents for giving birth to them? From Anjani to Defaulters to FMC to Aggrieved to one Chidambaram now, fraud accused mastermind, perpetrator of economic genocide, JShah has tried blaming everyone. In whose control was money & stocks?
1322 2018-03-20 14:42:46 Yup... over the last year which matches the timeline for this disaster. Claims he's selling to fund his charity work... could be a coincidence but moving $$ from stocks into a non-profit might be good way to protect funds, IMHO.
1323 2018-03-20 14:42:31 Stocks move from low volatility periods to high volatility periods. Scan for stocks forming low volatility cluster. They offer good risk reward setups.
1324 2018-03-20 14:42:24 My solution:  1)extremely more strict background checks 2)bump stocks gone 3) anyone threatening or exhibiting signs of violent behaviour loses their guns immediately, but temporarily, with due process to determine if they can get them back. 4)Armed guards and some teachers armed

1336 2018-03-20 14:39:14 Then I can't imagine you would think there's a necessity for this at all. All it takes is for one disgruntled person to employ much needless devastation.
Common sense says to ban bump stocks. Bump stocks were found on ALL 12 of Vegas shooter's guns. 59 innocent lives lost!
1337 2018-03-20 14:38:40 As thought, raised the reserve shares by 7M...explains the weakness. Not something that I like to see. Market cap is still in the 4M range, so way undervalued compared to its peers but management uncertainty is the cause. All pot stocks getting "smoked" of late.  $SIGO

1345 2018-03-20 14:34:48 Common sense discussion about gun control. Mental heath checks for people who purchase a gun, no one under 21 owning a gun (unless you are in the military). Banning bump stocks, WHY is it the rest of the world does not seem to have this issue and WE DO??
1346 2018-03-20 14:34:43 Bwahahahaha! Naku ha. Ang hirap daw maka tiyempo ng stocks ng aztec na yan. Laging ubos. Hehehe
1347 2018-03-20 14:34:02 Educate me I admit to my lack of gun knowledge like many Americans. However in general Americans support banning what lawmakers refer to as Assault Weapons.  Let’s start with bump stocks . How do they help an active shooter like in the Vegas shooting.
1348 2018-03-20 14:33:47 I think all full auto, silencers, bump stocks, trigger cranks, and auto conversion kits should be illegal and have strict penalties. All new "assault style" rifles should have 10 round fixed clips, and existing ones should be legally limited to 10 round clips with fines for 1/
1349 2018-03-20 14:32:57 Concurrently, CO GOP are voting down making bump stocks illegal, voting for concealed carry for everyone, yada.     Fine people.

1366 2018-03-20 14:24:55 Again, no proof! The NRA is fine with background checks and outlawing bump stocks. Where some proof to back up your claims?
1367 2018-03-20 14:23:00 how many AK-47s are used in shootings in America? if they're so easy to get, as you say, why aren't they used? why did Stephen Paddock use AR-15s modified with bump stocks if AKs are readily available?
1368 2018-03-20 14:22:57 We already are worse off - exchange rates, massive negotiation bills, which we should pay all of. Just cancel the whole thing stocks will soar and you won't notice any difference tomorrow.

1380 2018-03-20 14:17:29 One of the most reliable and early signal to catch reversal/bottom is to study market breadth. How many stocks closing above 5% vs down 5%. Historically, 3-4 days out of 6-7 days with 10:1 ratio or better marked reversal.

1423 2018-03-20 13:59:39 @CharlesSchwab 1/2: Rate hikes don't have a uniform effect across financial markets. For example, rates tend to rise when the economy is improving, and a strong economy is also good for stocks. As a result, the S&P 500® Index historically has risen during rate-tightening cycles.

1430 2018-03-20 13:57:30 yeah, technically theft by deception, but the government condones it like bump stocks as they rise and fall on wall street.
1431 2018-03-20 13:56:57 Because banning them will do nothing. The bill proposed was far to vague and banned much more than just bump stocks. Also a bump stock isn’t required to bump fire. The same can be accomplished with a belt loop or a rubber band.

1439 2018-03-20 13:54:18 I agree. I played on E-Trade in the early 2000s & did fairly well. After I made a pretty good profit I took my $ and ran. I haven't traded stocks since then.
1440 2018-03-20 13:54:16 Surprisingly, it seems, Scottish fishermen have still not realised fishing stocks are finite and stand in need of sound scientific research to remain in existence. Such a pity fish don't have votes... #CFP #fisheries
1441 2018-03-20 13:53:51 Please. You have plenty of guns without bump stocks and semi automatic rifles to protect self and property. As far as foreign threats or domestic. I don’t think guns will help when ICBM’s are flying or weapons of modern warfare are used against this country.

1456 2018-03-20 13:49:26 You know why many do not profit in the stocks? They tend to argue and hate when you share a simple execution because they just cannot believe how simple it can be. Instead of trying it out and being disciplined in its execution, they argue about how it CANNOT be so simple.

1462 2018-03-20 13:48:54 This may be true, but if you notice, states are passing LAWS to ban texting and driving that will deter the practice.  No new laws banning semis or bump stocks because of - what else? - the NRA lobby.

1538 2018-03-20 13:21:33 London stocks were holding on to gains by midday on Tuesday, helped along by more deal news and with analysts divided over whether the softer-than-expected UK inflation print will ease pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates in May.

1632 2018-03-20 12:45:36 I foresee the “risk parity” trade having flat to negative returns for the next couple years. There will be no place to hide. Higher rates will bring yields up and multiples down. We brought forward alot of our return for the next decade into this one #stocks #investing
1633 2018-03-20 12:45:04 Well, the other stocks show public with the exchange. I think the private is reflecting it's investor base and nonexchange/public.  If current, it would show the exchange.  Besides, NEA also participated in their recent public offering

1653 2018-03-20 12:31:21 The 2012 ICES data on bass stocks was presented to the EU by the UK and rejected by France amongst others. Small scale UK fishermen supported some controls before stocks crashed. Now I’ve lost 60% of my spring income.

3) Take out trading profits time to time to your bank or to reinvest for long term

1781 2018-03-20 11:10:23 Resign of Harold Goddijn, Corinne Vigreux, Peter Wakkie and Taco Titulaer. THAT MAKES ME HAPPY! Because then the tomtom stocks will go up! Goddijn only likes down for own benefits.

1782 2018-03-20 11:10:15 @CityofCapeCoral you ate a bunch of idiots.  The council extends bat hours and now you want to being back “bump sticks” for automatic rifles.  Alcohol and guns don’t mix.   #GunHaters unite. Cape Coral WILL NOT have bump stocks.  GunHaters will sue the city.
1783 2018-03-20 11:10:13 I'm figure this for the people of the future the crypto is the new stocks an if a ton of you sticks to it they have a hard time taking something down that gain value value is hot an that what people want equal the cash flow more more so what we figure out this be equal for all

1787 2018-03-20 11:09:03 As Bass stocks are so low, it's correct to restrict over-fishing, besides, there's plenty more fish in the sea!
1788 2018-03-20 11:07:18 Without agreed EU quota system in place there would be no fish. Overfishing by all nations including UK decimated stocks.

1799 2018-03-20 10:57:28 Look at it this way: Scotland's waters have most of UK fish + 20% of the entire EU stocks.
The SFF spokespeople have previously sold this as an iScot would be weaker in negs.
They are wrong.
iScot would be in a *stronger* position in EU negs, due to its massive surpluses.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

2322 2018-03-20 04:43:15 It's interesting to note that a lot of midcap names have just stopped falling and have simply turned sideways almost hoping that the mkt stabilises somewhere here. These "relative strength" stocks need to be on the radar.

2324 2018-03-20 04:42:16 For investing, i agree on the uncertainty aspect. Indians are under-invested in stocks precisely for this reason. 
Trading is a completely different ball game. After taking a view it requires tremendous emotional control over one self. Similar to the one required in poker.

2366 2018-03-20 04:19:12 Another thing Inventure jumped from 14 to 23 in 2 months. That's 80% gains in 2 months. These are phenomenal returns and you must quickly cash on these even in stocks that you hold for the long term.

2372 2018-03-20 04:15:10 This is part of Zuckerberg's plan luring Chinese to scoop up his cheap stocks eventually gaining big enough for China to ok its market entry .
2373 2018-03-20 04:14:45 They talk about all kinds of guns and fear monger to go buy them before they get banned. They are also well known for saying one thing in public (bump stocks ban) then once behind closed doors take it back (like bump stocks). They ask for money all the time from their membership.

2387 2018-03-20 04:03:13 I shouldn't have to explain this to you. Assault weapons are semi-automatic. That's why there are bump stocks, to make them fire even faster than the 750-900 .223 rounds/min.@ 3X speed of sound. If they were fully automatic, they'd be machine guns (illegal).
2388 2018-03-20 04:03:13 Personally, I'm convinced that the rumors
about Stormy Daniels having a Trump dick pic
are just part of pump-and-dump

Don't be fooled.

2440 2018-03-20 03:28:05 Its unconstitutional to raise the age for firearm purchase ..bump stocks are not a factor in crimes or firearm homicides or crimes ..they are a novelty . ..so im not against Trump not destroying the bill of rights or passing useless laws .

2462 2018-03-20 03:16:48 You do realize they aren’t stupid enough to come & just take our guns...that would spark civil revolt. They will start gradually w bump stocks, then large clips, then certain ammo, silencers, then AR-15’s, then certain pistols, revolvers, rifles, etc over a period of time.

2497 2018-03-20 02:55:54 Fiduciary rule is now eliminated. Now actually, anyone buying stocks will not have protection. It becomes Buyer Beware! It is your responsibility to look out for yourself. How many of us are experts? Pension plans are now at risk.

2499 2018-03-20 02:54:09 The Republican Colorado state senators are probably cynically thinking, "Bump stocks are going to be banned nationally soon anyway, so why go on the record as voting for a gun-control measure at the state level?"
2500 2018-03-20 02:53:55 I’m sorry. I’m a record skipping on your “on the fence with bump stocks”!because they are “fun to use”...  hold on I gotta do my own threat assessment
2501 2018-03-20 02:53:31 Hmmmm. ... that is not what surveys show... 60% are using our 1 trillion dollar deficit to buy back stock to raise the price on remaining stocks.  Old trick.. but not "trickle" down!
2502 2018-03-20 02:53:18 your stocks are high
2503 2018-03-20 02:53:02 A good many Americans support the 2nd ammendment. In my case, I am against bump stocks, Assault Rifles and high capacity clips. I am very much against lobbiest organizations, such as the NRA, that but politicians
2504 2018-03-20 02:52:50 Maybe they just felt they needed some time to accurately count the number of bump stocks the Denver City Council collected...  I believe the current estimate is ZERO!!!

2508 2018-03-20 02:49:05 I don't disagree with this.   The times spent hunting with my father produced some of my best memories of him.  However, we didn't hunt with AR-15's nor did we use bump stocks or clips larger than 5 rounds.

2510 2018-03-20 02:48:47 Very true. We love crypto more then stocks. I'm working in stock markets but dreaming of crypto all the time.
2511 2018-03-20 02:48:46 @timothysykes My name is Deva I am starting to learn about Penny Stocks & I want to Thank You for being such a great teacher. This quote describes you perfectly: "Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn"
2512 2018-03-20 02:47:50 @Robot_Wealth Hello, I'm curious can your course be applied to trading crypto? My sister is learning machine learning, and has been wondering about practical applications, would like to trade crypto and not forex or stocks via API.
2513 2018-03-20 02:46:44 I support Sen. Merrifeld. This threat is exactly why bump 
stocks should be banned. Why is this person not being investigated? Protect our children, protect all with common sense gun laws. We support our legislators who love people instead of guns.
2514 2018-03-20 02:45:38 なんか今回も落ちた気がするが
2515 2018-03-20 02:45:08 What stocks were to the previous generation, cryptos are the same to the new generation. I’ve never seen 20 year olds being excited about stocks. But they’re crazy and protective about the cryptos they believe in. 

The future is crypto and there’s no stopping it #blockchain

2517 2018-03-20 02:42:50 Yes, it is complex due to that feedback.
The risk is disrupting the carbonate dependant species in the first place. Maybe that will trigger more algal blooms due to decreased consumers, krill stocks may decrease affecting whole food chains.

2519 2018-03-20 02:40:11 Shame on you Sen Hill. Bump stocks create weapons whose sole purpose is to kill as many people as fast as possible. How could you not ban these? #Enough #MarchForOurLives
2520 2018-03-20 02:39:26 16 days and counting since you said you'd be signing an EO banning bump stocks "soon". Tell us again how the NRA doesn't scare you. Chicken 
2521 2018-03-20 02:38:58 My 1st day on Twitter....I am starting to learn about Penny Stocks & watching alot of Youtube video's. Some of the best ones are by Timothy Sykes & his students, they are completely open & honest about everything which helps out a ton.  I like to be challenged, so wish me luck!!!
2522 2018-03-20 02:38:48 Yup I'm sure I check it weekly and my 401k runs plenty of stocks. You need a financial advisor my dear

2526 2018-03-20 02:36:45 It does not give me happiness to see stock prices fall 50% even if i made money on these stocks before. Seeing people lose their hard earned money here in the market makes me sad.
DO ME A FAVOR AND CUT THEM LOSERS NOW.
2527 2018-03-20 02:36:11 I agree with threat assessments. We must have that visual. It will be vastly different in rural areas than bigger cities. Bump stocks I'm on the fence about. They hinder accurate shooting but they are fun to use. Agreed on checks & registrations. 
What loopholes?
2528 2018-03-20 02:36:00 Yeah I wish I Owned stocks in something!  look at the athletes, Celebrities entertainers, they are out there making multi millions of dollars for playing sports, people  entertaining us but our teachers make nothing

2538 2018-03-20 02:31:45 Who else prefers crypto over stocks?
2539 2018-03-20 02:31:17 Imagine what USA would look like if stocks were -50% from 2016 election. In a perverse way it would be fun to witness. All of the animosity would be at shriek level 10 as impeachment hearings raged. Impeachment about? If down -50% it would not matter the reason. #mob #rules
2540 2018-03-20 02:30:03 Scroll down & click ' important links' > ' stock watch list'.  Scroll down as per current date to find the intraday stocks
2541 2018-03-20 02:29:31 Thats happened because we infused corporations with liquidity for free. After that, more assets they have, more loans with low interest they can take, or more moeny their stocks are attracting. Then is easy to buy your rivals and keep wages low.
2542 2018-03-20 02:29:21 Main thing? Research! Let’s get a visual and answers will come easier. Outside that? Bump stocks, National checks and registries, loopholes, and  most unpopular; any gun that enables a mass shooting with cataclysmic injuries within minutes. There’s more but that’s a start
2543 2018-03-20 02:29:13 Jacob Rees-Mogg recently said that food banks are ‘uplifting’; now he plans to throw fish stocks into the Thames in protest of Theresa May’s Brexit deal 

The man is a first-rate imbecile
2544 2018-03-20 02:29:00 @realDonaldTrump has tweeted thoughts and prayers in response to the deaths of scores of Americans from mass shootings and has yet to make good on his promise on banning bump stocks or raising the age to buy a gun. Is God his master or the NRA?
2545 2018-03-20 02:28:14 There are plenty of conservatives that agree that Universal background checks are reasonable, banning bump stocks and closing loopholes in current laws is reasonable. No one wants to take your guns away unless of course you’re crazy
2546 2018-03-20 02:27:27 Any suggestions on which stocks?
2547 2018-03-20 02:26:32 .
More than half of Americans don't even own stocks.

The current stock market is now just a new variety of ponzi scheme, manipulated at will, corrupt af.
2548 2018-03-20 02:25:53 I’ve been trading stocks and watching CNBC/Bloomberg for years. Much to my chagrin I never took his candidacy seriously cause I knew he was a criminal and narcissist. I kept waiting for the press to expose him. Hope it’s not too late now
2549 2018-03-20 02:25:19 @_anujsinghal How can you even allow analyst like Vijay Chopra to recommend stocks daily when the risk reward of their trading ideas is not even 1:1
2550 2018-03-20 02:25:17 We have more than 300 per year in the city of Baltimore. Yet waiting periods, age restrictions and mental health screenings are still in limbo. Bump stocks for semi automatic weapons can still be purchased by citizens under 21 years of age. Terrifying.
2551 2018-03-20 02:25:16 We’ll vote you out. I’m registering voters on #marchforourlives in Denver — and we’l register all spring & summer. SHAME ON YOU. Bump stocks are for mass murder & nothing more. #ownedbynr
2552 2018-03-20 02:25:05 Wish I had kept BroLo or at least picked him up again in time, he's killing it right now  Losing KD after a bye week also hurts really bad. Looking to boost fg% and stocks: do you think 4 games each of Harrell & Poeltl will be more valuable than 2 each of WCS & Labissiere?
2553 2018-03-20 02:25:02 People need to accept that E&P stocks are simply trading vehicles to play the commodity cycle. And once they start buying back stock, sell.

2560 2018-03-20 02:19:19 Good advice. Of course if I was better at taking advice I'd own original stocks in both Starbucks and Microsoft. But no, I said I don't play the stock market....

2561 2018-03-20 02:18:28 @MalcolmNance unfortunately Facebook is too greedy to do anything substantial at this point. People will delete their accounts and stocks will continue to fall is when action will take place. Could possibly be too little too late.

2567 2018-03-20 02:15:45 The fact that gun shows operate in the way that they do is obscene. The fact that if someone else buys a gun for you and you kill people, you don't face serious consequences. Bumpfire stocks. That you don't need a mental health eval to own a gun

2590 2018-03-20 02:00:12 School shootings? Perhaps it would be far better to borrow a page from the Congressional playbook. Ask yourself how wackos, large capacity magazines and bump stocks are not a factor in the halls of Congress. They have armed protection. It works!

Thank you for your experts who have examined Canada’s dividend paying stocks. And your special new report which reveals:   this and  that
And the “Gold”Money-Back Guarantee
2605 2018-03-20 01:53:22 Bump stocks which is PURELY to subvert a law already in place? Gone
2606 2018-03-20 01:52:07 Yes, thats what I'm alao trying to find. Yung mga stocks that refuse to go down, w/ longer term trend intact. In fact, some still posing a breakout. Downside is, this market looks like madaming ma biktima sa whipsaw..I'll opt for smaller positions or 100%  cash muna.
2607 2018-03-20 01:49:56 Zuckerberg’s karma for selling our personal information to CA. I hope his stocks plummet. Effing traitor.
2608 2018-03-20 01:49:22 Most of us lefty’s want to ban semi-auto assault style weapons, huge cartridges & bump stocks.Close loopholes on background checks, and while we’re at it-let’s not forget to simply enforce the laws on the books.Some bans could have time limits based on research results. Thoughts?
2609 2018-03-20 01:47:50 See there, you got your little checklist of things to attack gun owner's with. Sick of it. 

Bump stocks have been used in ONE RECORDABLE CRIME. One! Why do you desire to ban them? Someone told you they're bad?

Background checks already exist. Yes, your desire is to infringe.
2610 2018-03-20 01:47:50 Civilian versions of these rifle are not combat arms rifles. They are simi- automatic rifles with tactical stocks and hand guards. This is as stupid as the “fully simi-automatic” comment reporters use to make stupid people more scared.

2613 2018-03-20 01:45:12 I hope their stocks plummet again tomorrow. I want them to pay for allowing that bullshit to happen. Hit them in the pocketbooks. Couldn't happen to a better bunch of crooks.

2625 2018-03-20 01:38:49 See, I had the benefit of seeing who on my Facebook posted the story beforehand. So I wasn't as surprised considering the guy who graduated high school with a C in geometry and tells me he works in "stocks", also posts Farrakhan conspiracy theories about fluoridated tap water.

2627 2018-03-20 01:38:34 MD Senate just voted to ban bump stocks, device found on Las Vegas shooter’s guns that allows a rifle to fire more like a machine gun. There was bipartisan support to ban them in Senate. Bill now goes to House #mdga18 @fox5dc
2628 2018-03-20 01:36:15 So, the odious EU will let us negotiate trade deals during the implementation period but not let us implement them. Meanwhile they can continue plundering our fishing stocks. 
Disgraceful sell out.
2629 2018-03-20 01:35:34 Uber and Facebook takes a hit today. No wonder stocks tank today.
2630 2018-03-20 01:35:26 The same thing happened to Seaworld stock when Blackfish came out. No one wanted to own stocks in a company that abuses marine life. Moral Divestment.
2631 2018-03-20 01:33:41 The point it that there will now be headwinds in $FB and #social stocks going foward also will be increase government scurintiy as to data being collected. Data = profits = sell FB or be cautious if you are in it
2632 2018-03-20 01:33:34 That was me back in 2009 when I thought I made a sweet move shorting stocks and the government decided to change the rules.

2636 2018-03-20 01:31:15 Guns are already regulated. We should maybe try strictly enforcing those regulations first and see where that gets us before we start throwing away our rights.

There are a few things like bump stocks that should go away but beyond that..? See what I wrote above.

Objectively.
2637 2018-03-20 01:31:11 Pay off my student debt, donate to some charities, invest in some stocks, build a Blu-ray collection, and build a comfy collection of Blu-rays and collectable figures.

2641 2018-03-20 01:27:55 Still allowing bump stocks, though.
2642 2018-03-20 01:26:26 The EU has a very strong incentive to ensure fish stocks are preserved in UK waters because those fish swim back and forth between different territorial waters. Depleting fish in UK waters means other EU countries get less fish too.
2643 2018-03-20 01:26:15 Obama didn't do anything about bump stocks, why are you trying to erase his legacy?
2644 2018-03-20 01:24:19 Please remember, people, Liarwatha doesn't own stocks; she has mutual funds.
2645 2018-03-20 01:24:05 And also he will ban bump stocks.

Unfunded tax cuts to corporations making record profits w/record cash on hand in name of creating jobs went straight to buying back their own stocks. Our children's children will pay. Just when you thought no help for stupid along came Trump made dumber.
2650 2018-03-20 01:23:31 So banning bump stocks, requiring background checks, supporting ERPOs is infringing on your 2A?

Get rid of bump stocks or anyt that turns reg guns into WMD. What is it exactly, that you're against? Why do you slam yr classmates for wanting this? 
2659 2018-03-20 01:18:51 You're not answering the question, no one is going to make a bookstore that exclusively only stocks racist nazi books, thats such an unlikely and extreme example that I'm just dismissing it. C'mon man lets not play this game.

2676 2018-03-20 01:12:16 Right, just like you were going to sign an executive order banning bump stocks, where is it?
2677 2018-03-20 01:10:13 I get it, potstocks have opened well today and look to continue this momentum. Just saying $cann is one of many stocks to have the price action about to turn. Hardly the best one to have your chips in.
2678 2018-03-20 01:09:19 You were the one who rescinded their protections. Also, children are DEAD. You have not followed up on your promise to BAN BUMP STOCKS. Did your NRA handlers not like the idea?
2679 2018-03-20 01:06:54 We told you: Stocks at mid-day near the engineering ans 20 lashes.
2680 2018-03-20 01:05:42 U said it girl !! They got theyre tax breaks so I don’t understand why theyr upset if our GREAT president has obvious love for Putin and people in his campaign may have worked with a foreign enemy to sway one tiny election. Who cares about stupid treason when stocks are up!!
2681 2018-03-20 01:04:04 Yes. It’s her.
2682 2018-03-20 01:03:45 Por qué el Brawl usa 3 stocks y nosotros no es una mejor pregunta
2683 2018-03-20 01:03:39 Kaz, I could be unserious and say stop holding back but sadly what you're saying is too true and needs said. Trump and republicans are holding DACA hostage as they did CHIPS before the shutdown and bump stocks which they tried to trade for more guns instead of banning outright.
2684 2018-03-20 01:02:18 Good news: you’re in the new super smash bros... Bad news: you’re stuck as yoshi and everytime you lose a stock you respawn looking just a bit chubbier... Worst news: it’s a ten-minute game, you got infinite stocks and 7 other players ganging up on you...
2685 2018-03-20 01:02:14 The problem is fish do not know when they cross international borders the only way to protect fish stocks is a cfp with all other states if not fish stocks could be wiped out for generations
2686 2018-03-20 01:02:12 Stocks plunged today, yet @FoxNews has no mention of Cambridge Analytica on homepage. Again... non-partisan stocks plunged, and...
2687 2018-03-20 01:01:41 LOL I'm not sure what that means? But basically I don't really wanna sling stocks again. It's hard enough doing for my little PA.

2690 2018-03-20 01:00:06 Yeah, I notice that liberal boycotts are far more effective than other parties “boycotts” where they complain yet don’t actually do anything.. note stocks and events they “boycott.”
2691 2018-03-20 00:58:08 Starting right before the election in November.  My stocks have really shot up.  Amazon, Costco, Visa, Apple to name a few that have really increased.

2702 2018-03-20 00:49:58 The only thing Trumps plan will do is make drugs more expensive, cause more crime, fill up the jails, cost tax payers more money and fill his pockets with cash since he has stocks in Geo(private prison stock). There's always  behind all he does.
2703 2018-03-20 00:49:33 Fuck it.  The likes of @iamkarendavila is the reason why my stocks are plunging!  @ABSCBNChannel2 worth is almost nothing with journalists like her!
2704 2018-03-20 00:48:26 Gun reform: sensible gun control. Ban assault weapons like the AR-15 and AK-47. Make it so everyone has to be 21 to own a gun. Universal background checks. No loopholes for gun shows. Ban bump stocks
2705 2018-03-20 00:44:58 You are dumb. All last sales or down turn in stocks.

2715 2018-03-20 00:37:23 Today, in Corporations class, I told my first joke while presenting a case.

It was an old Ringling Brothers case from the 1940s, about an agreement on the voting of stocks

I could not resist, and began my recitation of the facts by saying that it was a bit of a circus of a case
2716 2018-03-20 00:37:19 What have you been taking...? SNP staying in Europe would lead to a negotiated agreement, maybe good maybe not, but negotiated all the same. What has been agreed is EU can set quotas, regardless of impact on stocks and UK has gave up any semblance of a veto if we don’t agree.

2719 2018-03-20 00:33:10 The NRA is a civil rights advocacy group. The NRA doesn’t market weapons, they don’t manufacture weapons, and they don’t take money from the  government (taxpayers). The NRA has actually proposed bans on bump stocks, and gun safety measures.

2734 2018-03-20 00:23:22 I liked it better when it was called the G-League. Once the NBA has a G-League affiliate for all 30 teams, they need to expand the draft to make it more like how baseball stocks the minors.

2736 2018-03-20 00:23:01 Yes I agree, where as real estate may seem an obious pick it requires marketing as does online selling.

As for day trading one can shrink as fast as grow, in any case stocks are influenced by marketing.

2752 2018-03-20 00:13:07 More people are upset by home invasion than bank robbery. Should we only outlaw home invasions? The idea that we should pick one is a false choice. Huge majority of Americans support universal background checks, bans on high cap mags, bump stocks, etc.
