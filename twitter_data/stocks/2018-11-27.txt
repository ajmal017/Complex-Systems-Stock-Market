3 2018-11-27 23:58:57 Over 180,000 Keyforge decks discovered. I get a feeling this will jump quite a bit when new stocks arrive at game stores.

Hopefully it won't be long before those that couldn't get a starter set or single decks manage to join in the fun.

8 2018-11-27 23:54:27 Stocks, bonds, notes, etc don't need international liquidity and low TX/compliance cost in the same way money does. 

You only need your stock/bond to trade in one or two countries to get enough liquidity/investment.

15 2018-11-27 23:51:20 Most ppl don't own stocks and labor markets are getting very tight. More and more boomers will be retiring, so wages are pretty much a given to rise. If wages are rising, but asset markets crash, I don't think 80% of Americans will care.
16 2018-11-27 23:50:37 GM stocks went up after the announcement. Since the investors are happy,  leadership and management will remain intact. Welcome to the world of 401K retirement. As long as investments grow, ppl don't care if their neighbors are out of work.

40 2018-11-27 23:48:12 Even the slander of the business by the president of the United States harms the business stocks and sales. 

GM is one of Michigan's largest employer. The harm will negatively impact and lead to a mass migration of the state's finest engineers, students, and workers.

42 2018-11-27 23:46:41 Papa John's stocks wouldn't be sinking and the former CEO in question wouldn't be despised by his own former company if he had just shut his mouth during that conference. Now Papa John's may go under and it could have been easily avoided if you kept your opinions to yourself.
43 2018-11-27 23:46:32 Apple stocks, Microsoft stocks, GM plants, rapes, robberies, and the weather man thinks he’s funny, but the sportscaster thinks he’s the coolest dude. News wtf is it good for when it can’t teach “how to pick up chicks”? What’s a man to do?
44 2018-11-27 23:46:15 Bring back the stocks!!
45 2018-11-27 23:45:59 Yea. Most Americans don't hold stocks. 84% of stocks are owned by ~5-10% of ppl (something like that).
46 2018-11-27 23:43:14 I really need to start shorting stocks based on his tweets.  I'd probably be able to retire at this point.
47 2018-11-27 23:42:22 That’s what I’m saying lol it’s not reliable if you gotta get me to 160+ for it to work, your stocks will be way gone by then  100-120 is solid though, but again I doubt it lol
48 2018-11-27 23:42:09 Maybe. Labor markets still seem very tight and only seem to be getting tighter.

Asset markets might crash, but few Americans own stocks so most ppl won't care. If labor is tight and wages continue to rise, nothing else will matter.
49 2018-11-27 23:41:36 I struggle with the idea of a Santa rally. It's like "Yay! It's Christmas! Stocks go up! Wait why?"

56 2018-11-27 23:31:14 I have no stocks except those in my pension plan.  I lost half the value in 2008 despite being in "steady" options for those close to retirement.  Now the rest is basically gone, 5 years into retirement.  The economy isn't great for me!

62 2018-11-27 23:27:40 The best time to buy stocks is at the end of each year

Investors sell off in December +take losses for tax benefits

This adversely affects supply + demand causing prices to Drop (Discounts)

In January, there’s a dramatic increase in prices as investors flood+ re-buys!
63 2018-11-27 23:26:37 Is a market that’s dependent on feel good news about less than 10 stocks a real market?

65 2018-11-27 23:26:03 Thanks for posting this ! I totally agree. I think we get a seasonal bounce, and then a very bad 2019 for stocks. And yes Bitcoin good long term, esp at these prices.

67 2018-11-27 23:25:13 Do it Greta.  I look at the stocks that I have invested in, and you see the executive compensation vs. shareholder return frightening sometimes.  How much should one person make for a $.50 dividend... Or their penchant to build elaborate buildings/shrines rather than pay divs
68 2018-11-27 23:23:14 Instead of having just a savings account you should also have a percentage going towards investments like stocks, crypto currencies, small businesses etc. let your money make profit for you while you sleep
69 2018-11-27 23:23:12 If you were given the chance to buy a $10,000 dollar asset , for $3500 but you are uncertain how many months it would take to fully realize the $10,000  

 Would u take the deal ?

74 2018-11-27 23:20:31 First off, they wouldn't make any money out of their billions by making sure their employees from the closed sites get employed at other sites. Then, their stocks go up 5% after this news is known? Stock manipulation,  anyone?
75 2018-11-27 23:18:58 People that think they gonna short it to death, remember there is less than 21M btc available. It's a deflationary asset. It's available for the entire world unlike stocks which require a brokerage account. Anyone can open a btc wallet. 
They can only short it to zero then PUMP!!
76 2018-11-27 23:18:41 Well it got slaughtered for absolutely no reason. It was more to do with the fact it didn’t sell off when the rest of the stocks got wrecked. Earning report wasn’t as bad as it was made out. Still a cash rich company.

79 2018-11-27 23:15:33 It depends if we have a trend change I guess. In January still bull market and tech stocks led the charge. What’s the new leadership here? I don’t see any. If this is a bear MCM is correct.
80 2018-11-27 23:15:27 Oh and by the way, Jimmy Carter appointed Volcker, costing him the election as Volckers policies caused a severe credit crunch and recession. Whether Powell will let stock market go and stop targeting financial conditions still to be determined. Stocks continue to hold support!
81 2018-11-27 23:13:51  I don’t think that’s fair at all

The stance worth pushing back against is “items is better / stocks no items is boring and no fun”, that stance has been crushed and rightly so

It’s not my stance - I’m “stocks no items and stocks yes items are both differently competitive”

87 2018-11-27 23:09:33 Be interesting to know if anyone in Trump's family or friends sold GM stocks this week before he went after GM and if any will buy low just before he makes up with GM.
88 2018-11-27 23:08:45 economic market. The bubble economy, for example the overwhelmingly developed entertaining industry, have been created by Stocks I guess. This is ridiculous too. Why not we use currency exchange rate to limit the ability of Wall Street finance, in nationwide

92 2018-11-27 23:06:48 That's the biggest thing that gets overlooked when a company makes moves people don't like.

98 2018-11-27 23:03:02 GM spent $63 Billion of Trumps TAX Returns on Buyng BACK GM STocks! Thaqt is what happen to all those Tax Returns. We've been here an done this in Reagan's yrears! It's how we lost our Steel Mills&Merged with Canada From Reagan"s Big Tax Cuts! They did Mergers&Stock By BAck's!
99 2018-11-27 23:03:01 So they had all of us throw out ALL of our Romain lettuce and recently found the origin to be in a single farm in California.  I may be wrong but I feel like lettuce stocks would've been a prime buy... If there is such a thing.  This is a stupid tweet but I'm owning it.

102 2018-11-27 23:00:34 Obama saved GM, they paid it back right away! Ford is also going to lay off. Remember this tax cuts to the rich, well they did not invest in their workers they put it in their stocks. And the steel tariffs are killing them. Thanks for the recession to come!

108 2018-11-27 22:58:08 You're right, it's so simple, just short the stocks that have bonds trading under par. There is no excuse for any portfolio to lose money with that strategy.
109 2018-11-27 22:57:06 Now don't be so cynical. The billionaires who got tax breaks invested in the stock market, shares went up they made a fortune then sold so stocks went down but at least someone did well out of it you have to admit.
110 2018-11-27 22:56:42 Strong day for couple solar stocks today $VSLR and $RUN. Other notables: $HEAR and $REGI. Don't miss Part 2 of my screening criteria for finding winners later tonight.
111 2018-11-27 22:56:23 Don't get the volume differences on $AZY.ax and $ADT.ax. I'm broke and afraid of getting locked out of stocks because of day trading rules, so I'm sticking with $ADT.ax. Maybe the new hole will boost this thing.
112 2018-11-27 22:56:15 I understand you well. You can find plenty stocks as 10,000 stocks to play, ha!! I buy and hold til reach top, I sell then buy another stock to play. Cool
113 2018-11-27 22:56:01 Bonds steadied and stocks were mixed as investors focussed on domestic exposures. Sagging industrial commodities point to ongoing growth concerns, and cryptocurrencies languished at twelve month lows @MicMcCarthy_CMC
114 2018-11-27 22:55:51 $SPY Today. It's certainly not what bears were expecting. A big plus for bulls with many stocks at very attractive levels. Setting up well.

116 2018-11-27 22:55:00 I wondered if he owned stocks. It did go up.
117 2018-11-27 22:54:28 I went through in the steel industry sad to say several times. Executives got very rich with bonus and stocks. Workers got pay cuts and lost benefits.
118 2018-11-27 22:53:14 Ladies, if he:

* Emails you too often
* Treats you like a number
* Makes you pay to send money to friends
* Takes a commission when you buy stocks
* Nails you with high MERs

He’s not the one. He’s a big bank.
119 2018-11-27 22:52:42 I don't think like that. I just choose and hold, and i think it's good stocks. And i don't really understand about stocks trading or investing, just understand fx
120 2018-11-27 22:52:19 What about 21 stocks 
121 2018-11-27 22:52:05 I'm pretty sure the stocks fell because of what GM did, not Trump's tweets. LMAO
122 2018-11-27 22:52:00 Wish I could get my hands on $1,000,000 of capital to invest!

130 2018-11-27 22:46:57 But no reason to buy US stocks with huge debt.
131 2018-11-27 22:46:04 That's a good thing if you are currently buying stocks. Bad if you plan on cashing out your 401k soon.
132 2018-11-27 22:46:01 I hear you. It’s going to start getting REALLY hairy. There’s a lot of money at stake and these stocks WILL take massive hits. If ppl can’t see it, it’s their problem. I’m done arguing with idiots over it, that’s for sure 
133 2018-11-27 22:46:00 As usual, Trump proves himself even dumber! What does he think will happen if he cuts "all @GM subsidies, including electric"? One predictable result already: GM stocks have dropped 3.5% today on the news. More? Yes: GM will move even more plants/jobs to China, Mexico, Canada...
134 2018-11-27 22:45:45 Buy Microsoft Apple stocks
135 2018-11-27 22:45:37 Before, liked when stocks up in AH. 

Liked when futures up. 

Liked when up PM. 

Not anymore. 

LIKE only when I finish green.
136 2018-11-27 22:45:33 This goes for Pot and Bulk shipping stocks also. But if you don't get in the game you can't complain when they go parabolic!

137 2018-11-27 22:43:37 apple stocks rise by 30%.
138 2018-11-27 22:43:32 you do realize that the majority of the people that don't really want to help the climate or actually the Democrats seeing on how most of them have share stocks in petroleum and other forms of fossil fuels. Look to AlGore, what plane does he travel in again.
139 2018-11-27 22:42:20 There’s going to be shit loads of this now making the round! Can’t wait
140 2018-11-27 22:42:09 Now? He's been doing the put option plays on pot stocks for months.
141 2018-11-27 22:41:17 GM is no different. Same logic and rules apply. Furthermore i dont recall anyone barking about Soros driving down FB stocks after selling all his FB stock, after Zuckerberg just recently refused to sell FB to Soros.Hmmm.
142 2018-11-27 22:40:19 ...and abuse of public trade by screwing over secured bond holders and giving preference to the unions (which through buying the stocks put them in a position of becoming owners...which is exactly who the unions were supposed to 'protect' their workers from).
143 2018-11-27 22:40:18 This upcoming recession and GM closing plants is all on GOP and Trump. GM took their part of the $1 trillion tax scam, bought back stocks and running away. More companies to follow.
144 2018-11-27 22:40:17 No ma'am u goin down like stocks
145 2018-11-27 22:39:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
146 2018-11-27 22:37:49 Shouldn't they buy Gold stocks and sell covered calls for income in their tax deferred accounts. Coins that don't appreciate or generate income in retirement account is wasteful and costly.

148 2018-11-27 22:37:29 One is money, keep the money that you have control over, away from Яepublicans. Stores, stocks, shows. Let them support themselves. They would consume themselves because they do not give to the least among them. They squeeze them dry and blame others for their problems.
149 2018-11-27 22:35:22 “Stocks finished higher this afternoon listening to NPR News.” Public radio is wild.
150 2018-11-27 22:34:57 Probs not I’m afraid 
151 2018-11-27 22:34:41 Jellyfish in large numbers are a sign that the fish stocks are badly depleted ....... as they are in the Black Sea :)
152 2018-11-27 22:34:31 Point is not that this is 2007... big picture is that evidence does not point to stocks going higher
153 2018-11-27 22:33:55 The only way that money can be replaced is if you, or somebody else puts MORE money into the stocks you're holding.

Equities are a black hole for created wealth.
154 2018-11-27 22:33:54 Big money managers are moving cash to emerging markets & out of the US.  The stock market is more than the 30 Dow stocks. The Russell 2000 and  NASDAQ are both in correction territory.  Inflation is above 2.5% and stocks are down, so we could care less about the tiny dividend.
155 2018-11-27 22:33:17 December.
Get ready.
Watch your stocks.
Be careful what you believe.
Be careful who you believe.
Deception is everywhere, in everything.

156 2018-11-27 22:33:06 Ha ha fuckin brillaint. So casual. That’s probably why hand balled it later on!!
157 2018-11-27 22:32:14 And buy back all of their stocks instead of the promised time tested - not workable - trickle down crap.
158 2018-11-27 22:31:56 Omg! I hate bullies! Name and shame ! Poor lad, my grandson had this for 4 years at school and all the school did was to tell him to hide in classroom!  Stocks perhaps!
159 2018-11-27 22:31:51 My Vegetable Soup  is #Delicious. Hope you all used your hambones, Turkey bones, and collard green stems to make your respective cooking stocks. Don't let all that Thanksgiving go to waste.
160 2018-11-27 22:31:42 US stocks may be the first to hit the 1 trillion dollar valuation again but I think your very foolish to think that we will be the first to 2 trillion dollar evaluation assuming the Chinese economy doesn’t crumble after the end of the worldwide credit cycle/US trade war
161 2018-11-27 22:30:32 Actually, the path towards ECONOMIC RECESSION began with your tax Scam, your Tariffs & your Trade War. The recession is already hitting as rates are rising, stocks are down, factories are closing, stores are going bankrupt, farmers can't sell to China, etc. #TheTrumpRecession
162 2018-11-27 22:30:16 Tim how you find stocks today?
163 2018-11-27 22:30:02 The market does not know if you are long or short and could not care less. forex stocks
164 2018-11-27 22:29:52 How’s the gasoil crack so high when there’s a shortage of heavy crude? Is it mainly scarcity of diesel stocks and strong demand? I figure it is, just for the life of me haven’t had chance to follow more closely
165 2018-11-27 22:29:32 GM put out a statement in June they were hit hard by tariffs. 5 billion dollar losers, I believe.
Why did nobody jump to fix this problem or raise the roof over the corporate buy backs.
They received a big tax cut and it went to stocks and CEO's. Nobody said a word. Nobody.
166 2018-11-27 22:29:24 Very interested, that's exactly what the space needs now. I returned to crypto this year and I'm sad to see that greed has taken over this space. CT is 90% traders and IMO they should just go back to stocks. Crypto space doesn't need price speculation, but greed is insatiable.
167 2018-11-27 22:28:47 The stock market is a team sport. When more stocks participate we can all head in the same direction
168 2018-11-27 22:28:20 The market will finish up in November. Especially Value stocks
169 2018-11-27 22:26:54 Kudlow is full of s....! Saying that chinese trade and tarifs is only a miniscule effect on US economy... why in the world is trump pursuing this no win crussade in the 1st place. The entire financial market is on the brink of bear market! Stocks have fallen by 25 -35 pct!
170 2018-11-27 22:26:33 Gotta love stocks with gaps above and no gaps below. Draws in the fundamental and technical traders.
171 2018-11-27 22:25:26 Translation:  You’re losing 1,000s of jobs. Now I’ll make sure you lose MORE jobs by cutting subsidies. I gave GM a huge tax cut. With that they bought back over $10BILLION in stocks. Workers, middle class loses.
172 2018-11-27 22:25:26 How about when we predicted sterling would fall dramatically if leave won. I also predicted gold stocks would soar.
173 2018-11-27 22:24:14 This company (I owned stocks in - lost all) was bailed out by the American tax payers (in 2008) at a tune of 13.4 billion dollars as well as 4 billion to be received at a later date. It should of never been bailed out.

178 2018-11-27 22:23:18 Tax cut for the wealthy in action. Buy back stocks and lay off workers. Never buy GM.
179 2018-11-27 22:23:13 WTI likely $70 by year end with a big rally in stocks. Trump is going to get a truce over the weekend. OPEC will definitely cut.
180 2018-11-27 22:23:04 If the country is insolvent 40 years after you started saving, a well diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds isn't going to help much. The only advantage is you get to tell yourself an ant-and-grasshopper fable about individuals choosing to allocate investments correctly.
181 2018-11-27 22:22:42 Maybe we should being back the stocks
182 2018-11-27 22:22:39 Walmart, Amazon, Apple etc all did stock buyback and didn’t fire anyone. So I’m saying you stated companies bought back stocks then fired employees. Name one of those companies!

185 2018-11-27 22:21:23 I thought obama saved GM? People like me lost a bunch when he devalued the stocks and bonds that were market driven and priced and replaced it with phoney stock that no smart person would buy and he gave half to the union to support pensions for people that would vote for him.

187 2018-11-27 22:20:27 @realDonaldTrump now thinks he has the right to tell businesses what they can & can not do. Now he wants to take away tax breaks to GM when he cant' unless he takes them away from all the rich. GM stocks went up though LOL @POTUS is a phony #MAGA #MuellerTime
188 2018-11-27 22:20:02 WAY more fun than stocks.  I don't do much on the options.  I do Forex and Futures though and, when I can get away with it, Arbitrage on treasuries.  Harder to do now that the markets are so efficient and I don't have 25-50 million to play with like when I worked for Cambridge.

191 2018-11-27 22:18:03 I remember the first time I became aware of this phenomenon was 20 odd years ago when AT&T laid off 20K workers and were duly rewarded by their shareholders. It's sickening. Like how, in the aftermath of the US tax cuts, stocks soared bc of buy backs by cash rich companies.
192 2018-11-27 22:17:52 Do you have any suggestions for stocks moving forward? $TSLA? $SQ?
193 2018-11-27 22:17:19 Bill gets us thinking about that will be likely actual news soon enough.  Buy your stocks, travel, & let certain politicians into your home by adding his potential insights.  I predict the future for a living. I save lives. I set the bar high, so sure, I'm a little conservative.

197 2018-11-27 22:13:31 The rapid decline in sentiment the last few weeks is very positive for rest of year in markets. Only happened 4 times before, all at intermediate term lows. Stocks up the next week 3 of 4 times, with average gain of 3.5%.

Up 5 weeks later all 4 times, with average gain over 5%
198 2018-11-27 22:13:15 ... and GM’s stocks tumble. How many American companies has he done this to in two years?
199 2018-11-27 22:13:14 Canada is also losing a 100 year old factory losing 2.5k jobs.
We’ve bailed GM out and lost tones of money when reselling the stocks.

Only a matter of time before the market realises the increase in spot prices has only just begun and has a long way to run.

255 2018-11-27 21:50:37 Yes, there is a major downturn coming. Those who want you to buy stocks now just want to prop up the markets artificially.

269 2018-11-27 21:41:39 Thanks for sharing and letting me know about the other stores. I’m sorry to hear it was a bad experience. I guess I was lost in the #wargames supply, because no shop in San Luis Obispo county stocks them.  Next time I’m down there I’ll check the others out. Cheers
270 2018-11-27 21:41:35 Always invest 10% of your capital in #stocks . Stocks are highly volatile securities so it should not affect your lifestyle in any way. Only put what you can afford to loose, But to fight inflation you have to join this game either today or tomorrow
271 2018-11-27 21:40:29 So obviously you guys are knowledgeable. What do you suggest we do as a country to reduce shootings at our alarming rate. Other mordernized countries have almost none comparatively. Is it assault rifle and bump stocks?

275 2018-11-27 21:39:51 And the foremost use of TA remains...using TA methods to catch upside breakouts... Mostly but not always through stocks making new highs after long consolidation. These are the only two most important methods that investors may apply ...the rest all is the preserve of traders
276 2018-11-27 21:38:11 Stocks.
277 2018-11-27 21:38:10 Do not follow this advice! A 1-2% return is less than inflation, which is about 2.9% now so you'd actually be losing money. Stocks on the other hand average an over 7% return over time. Yes you will lose a lot--but you'll gain more, much more.

281 2018-11-27 21:36:53 Who else agrees that our glorious leader @realDonaldTrump should cover these losses with his own money?  Our jobs president loves killing jobs and tanking stocks.  How many billions has he lost for those he tweeted at?  Must be over 100 billion by now.
282 2018-11-27 21:34:34 I’m sure @realDonaldTrump and his cronies with GM stocks made lots of money But the workers the middle men they are the one losing. @realDonaldTrump tax’s breaks to the top1%  and terrifs is creating a downturn. As we all said it would. It never trickles down
283 2018-11-27 21:34:14 The president is using his Twitter account to target private companies and drive down their stocks but you probably can't hear me over the sound of your tongue slurping his boots.

302 2018-11-27 21:22:57 World stocks ex Europe edge higher: Us +.3%; Europe -.3%. Investors need to separate the signal from the noise. The noise is Trump's daily tweeting about more China tariffs; the signal is current China tariffs and whether there will be more. No way to tell so focus on eps-growth.

389 2018-11-27 20:37:36 #Stocks,#Indexes ..bull market psychodynamics. Doubtless the top will be signaled, but that is many days away.
390 2018-11-27 20:37:36 Agreed. Will when u got most of the canadain money in mmj stocks and they all crashed market will follow . Now oil is poo. Trade wars going on . It's a perfect storm for what we are seeing .
391 2018-11-27 20:36:45 One of my stocks is one more bad week away from getting sold tbh.
392 2018-11-27 20:36:45 Most companies have multiple steps with losses between each step. TC has become the new catch phrase to pump stocks. It’s not for every application and if you have multiple steps you can’t be profitable. For moms it’s great.

404 2018-11-27 20:33:45 Exactly. As Warren Buffett says, why wouldn’t you buy when stocks are on sale?  Yes they could go down more, but no one knows and if you are a LT investor, you will be fine.
405 2018-11-27 20:33:26 I have owned some of the stocks in my portfolio over 25 years. I go through spells of letting it sit or trading around it. Now I mostly let it sit. On 10/03 I went to 42% cash. After this week I will be trimmed down and will be at 60% cash. Economic indicators are pointing down.

409 2018-11-27 20:33:09 but i thought with your new NAFTA that we would come out on top on imports from canada and mexico?  maybe not a good idea to attack US companies via twitter and tank their stocks if you want them to afford to stay in the US??
410 2018-11-27 20:32:23 Considering that >80% of Americans don't own stocks, this is probably one of the few things Trump does that keeps his approval >40%.

A lot of healthcare names in this group but there are also a few untouched names left in Nasdaq. $MSFT is one of them. Remember what they did to mighty AAPL after my call. No one immuned
414 2018-11-27 20:30:06 There's 2 BIG ones I can think of. In the Scar v Leffen doubles incident, he pressed start to take his teammates stock, which is a mechanic in doubles melee. He hadnt run out of stocks yet, so he ended up pausing. Obvious accident, so people thought it was kinda grimy to enforce

420 2018-11-27 20:26:35 People keep comparing crypto to tech stocks and the dot com bubble. They fail to realize this is a monetary revolution before being a technological revolution. BTC is the clear leader in this front and should outperform massively in the long term.

441 2018-11-27 20:17:44 meh…

This isn't rocket science.

They spent 13.7B _on the stocks_. 

They recouped 10.2B on the sale.

Basic subtraction shows they sold at a loss.

Faith in the party won't change the numbers.
442 2018-11-27 20:17:41 Day traders are making a killing off trump dissing Apple.

Too bad it’s all negative news, sided with his usual bullshit

454 2018-11-27 20:13:23 In fairness to Phil, he wouldn't tweet negatively about Ford or GM stocks because that would be bad for him.

It makes sense that he boosts those stocks by framing massive layoffs and factory closures in a positive light.
455 2018-11-27 20:11:54 Sorry but you know what was more reckless? GM literally cutting jobs and then having their stock rise. To be honest, I understand why they did it- but it still sucks that corporate stocks rise at the workers expense.
456 2018-11-27 20:11:35 They were given loans and the GOVT received stocks as well. Look it up GM repaid all loans and the GOVT sold the stock at a profit. It was the right thing to do and saved a lot of jobs.
457 2018-11-27 20:11:02 Good to hear. I managed to locate a good specialist magazine store here in Nova Scotia that stocks it. I will put together my findings on buying UK mags over here and post it in the next day or so. Will be of interest to ex-pats, I think.

464 2018-11-27 20:08:01 GM stocks are down because the value of their products is not there.
They should have gone out of business back in 2008. That's where they were headed anyway.
To recover, what did they do - build factories in China.
That kind of thing should have been prohibited.
465 2018-11-27 20:05:09 MUST BE EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING--when you gave them millions of tax dollars and they bought stocks--gave themselves a raise and YET---still screwed the WORKERS.

467 2018-11-27 20:03:33 GM under the Obama bail out wiped all shareholders (retirees) stocks out & never made those shareholders whole. So those taxpayers got stuck 2x by GMs poor business management. I’m not buying they’ll ever make taxpayers whole; we shouldn’t be subsidizing poor business practices

474 2018-11-27 19:59:58 ... market share price depends on the mood of the crowd, are they willing to take risk in stocks or seek security in bonds? After the rally from 2009 its time for a break regardless of crude, tariffs or biz tax. Its just the mood of the crowd

476 2018-11-27 19:59:31 So in today's economy the way to make stocks rise for a company is to get rid of the workforce that means a lot of people are going to be going on welfare and Medicare can Trump really afford to take care of the people he fucked so bad

480 2018-11-27 19:58:26 yes he did.  trump cld do the same, he's foolish if he doesn't.  Stocks will plunge, he'll cause a recession pretty soon w/his HIGH deficits.  72 million for military on the border is ridiculous. Send them home, give some of that $ to GM.
481 2018-11-27 19:58:09 Prepare yourself for a market crash next year, the tariff trade war is economic suicide. In 2019, the blind optimism that allowed stocks to rise while the real economy suffered or stagnated will come to a sudden end. #itsgoingtogetugly

on the springboard for strong moves going forward. I would like to talk with U about them. My request would be that % profits go to child's Hosp.
487 2018-11-27 19:56:37 THATS WHAT I SAID!!! 3 people will be fired.. The person who stocks the ATM, the cash vault person, and for that amount, their supervisor I used to stock atms, there was at least 6 figures lost.. guaranteed.
488 2018-11-27 19:54:35 Lots of stocks are down 30%. That isn't because of tariffs. As you said, the fed raising rates with reckless abandon is a huge problem. Im not the one making simple claims, you are. You want this to be about tariffs and there NO ONE, not even GM is claiming that.

509 2018-11-27 19:45:02 Funny thing I've noticed #bitcoin #cryptocurrency jump to the upside whenever #stocks are very bullish. #Bitcoin is more similar to gold as it is a rare coin. It costs too much hardware and electricity to mine for an individual. The rarity will save it.

@business @SatoshiLite
510 2018-11-27 19:44:55 Mia .....Trumps goons in the finance world will be betting heavily on a drop in stock value at GM. He is forcing stocks down and is making money for his golfing chums.
511 2018-11-27 19:44:55 And we are all CERTAIN his stocks reflect those interests.

523 2018-11-27 19:41:35 GM stocks tank, they have to lay off more people. You see where this is going.
524 2018-11-27 19:41:13 Keep telling yourself that..your own party couldn’t agree on a compromise for comprehensive immigration reform .bump stocks still legal..couldn’t close the gap re:universal background checks..RX drugs still too high.. trying to get rid of pre-existing Hc protections.
525 2018-11-27 19:40:36 GM announced they are closing 5 plants in the US, cutting workers, Trump now tweeted about cutting their subsidies, their stocks plunged.
526 2018-11-27 19:40:34 Isn’t this like insiders trading?
Say you are going to stop subsidizing, and the stocks go down?
Who is stopping Trump and his friends from buying stocks and than continue subsidizing?

643 2018-11-27 18:57:20 In fact, I think one of the stressful things to study as an African student is financial economics. Having to understand stocks and share prices, bubbles and fads, booms and bursts, rationing and collaterals, primes and reserve rates, idiosyncratic and systematic risks. Aaaah

655 2018-11-27 18:49:59 Stocks are antithetical to mainstreet's need to preserve jobs for the middle class. It's all about stock price and "we could care less about average workers."

689 2018-11-27 18:37:31 Stocks in US are at a critical juncture. The unofficial sidelines meeting between Pres Xi and Pres Trump this Friday will give concrete direction to this market. From a long-term perspective we are still in a bullish phase with some slowdown and sideways consolidation.

Some stocks raised their dividends by over 10% this year, I doubt they are adding jobs. A moral capitalism sounds wonderful.

764 2018-11-27 17:56:26 Scientists say that stocks worldwide are collapsing because people are catching more than they report and must fish larger areas to get the same catch they used to get from a smaller area even 20 years ago, using more boats than ever. You’re fishing “Denial”.

769 2018-11-27 17:52:27 Q2: For a portfolio of say $100, you suggest to go for say 4-6 stocks.. Say we go with 5 stocks - so $20 per stock ( or 20%). When you tweet about a "small" buy in these choppy market (like you did with QLD or AMZN), how small is small? Would that be 2% or 1% of the portfolio?
770 2018-11-27 17:52:07 The idea is if the market and companies are doing well they will make better jobs and increase wages. 

What happens is they just buyback stocks, increase dividend and the workers get no benefits.

773 2018-11-27 17:49:52 last week could have been the low for U.S. Stocks. It's entirely possible. I'm not betting that it is.

779 2018-11-27 17:47:04 Great reminder from @BobPisani discussion on @HalftimeReport that manager behind $VTI is buying more stocks amid market volatility because more shareholders are putting money into the fund. While the #ETF is passively managed investors are not.
780 2018-11-27 17:46:42 But most corporations do invest to create more wealth. That’s how more wealth & opportunity is created. I don’t feel like a significant amount of them are not caring about that. The buying of stocks for a greater return is expected too. The object is to make more money.

790 2018-11-27 17:43:24 It looks like you have started enjoying under-performance of a few stocks more than the out-performance of your portfolio. 
791 2018-11-27 17:42:35 Got these gentleman on camera, see how they are in stocks in the 15th century and see how they get on.
792 2018-11-27 17:42:06 Couldn’t agree more. Thinking more towards the 3 than the 1. Either way, these analysts just expound on a stocks current trends and try to disguise it as a חידוש. While Apple is declining they say “Apple will decline”. And when it rises they’ll say ”Apple will rise”.
793 2018-11-27 17:41:38 No - it's just a ponzi scheme.  The valuation of these stocks is fictitious which puts pension funds (for working folks) at risk.  I could care less about investors losing their money. When 80% of ppl live paycheck to paycheck, the "free market" cannot be considered a success.

802 2018-11-27 17:35:57 Since 2008, bonds have outperformed stocks in all 14 S&P 500 corrections by an average of 14.4%. A hypothetical portfolio with 60% in S&P 500 stocks and 40% in a diversified portfolio of bonds would have outperformed an all-equity portfolio by 5.8% in those corrections.

If you were to have bought at that time and sold last month, you would have made 333x your investment. 
Even if you bought at $113 and held, you would have made 17x.

887 2018-11-27 16:58:04 Central bank liquidity drives stocks, not economic growth. The best environment to buy stocks is a dull, weak economy that the Fed wants to stimulate (1982, late 1998, 2009-13)

972 2018-11-27 16:20:20 yet spot price still rises significantly with no s232 outlook priced in.  I agree utilities are taking a wait & see approach, it also seems investors in U stocks also nervous due to previous false dawns.  It is a pressure cooker and IMO will explode on positive s232 or $30+ spot
973 2018-11-27 16:20:18 You guys noticed the theme last 24hrs ? Stocks discounting negative headlines . When sellers get absorbed on uncertainty headlines that drove the tape lower , it’s bullish .  For now at least

978 2018-11-27 16:18:43 $AAPL ... At oversold levels, bad news is already priced into stock. Hence, a move north of 175 would immediately target 178 and 181.

1106 2018-11-27 15:27:47 It was supposed to work that way. The rich and corporations would invest their tax breaks and create more jobs and invest to expand. It didn't work that way. Instead they bought back their stocks on the market and increased their returns to their investors.

1125 2018-11-27 15:18:28 The volumes in the stocks have dried up considerably...it's counter intuitive, however there's not a mad rush anymore to buy the stocks when the prices are much lower; while there will be one post the run up
1126 2018-11-27 15:18:18 $LMT One of the best stocks in my portfolio. Others trim and sell, I’m a buyer.  I started accumulating a decade ago, all the while nay sayers and doom and gloom advised against.  Mark my word, three months from now $LMT will crest $330 a share.
1127 2018-11-27 15:16:45 It stopped being sold by Apple worldwide and it stopped being produced. This doesn't mean they were going to trash already produced stocks. If they come back to produce it it means it sells more than the XR for sure. News may be deceptive, but the truth underneath must be read.

Also this is the idiot who proudly tweeted that Twitter stocks fell due to their "anti-brahminical" stance

No surprise if they keep tanking between the mess in DC and the GM announcement
1146 2018-11-27 15:06:40 Hi Ross, The difference in price is due to spread applied on US stocks. Being quoted a higher offer price and lower bid price acts as a deterrent to trading the stock outside of market hours. The share price will return to normal when the US markets reopen at 14:30 GMT.

Such a stupid take. I'm truly disappointed.

1201 2018-11-27 14:48:06 Meaning other than technical trading and speculation what are the drivers? Gold for example has been used as a hedge for inflation, so when inflation goes up people invest in gold to protect purchasing power, stocks are driven by earnings, oil and commodities have real use...

1203 2018-11-27 14:47:34 Maybe some do, but i don't.  I want objective investigative journalism.  There are countless stories of the retail public being swindled by investing in hyped up stocks.  Shouldn't the financial press be the ones revealing the truth behind the hype?
1204 2018-11-27 14:46:41 Not true. FB shares are traded every market day in very high volume relative to other stocks. Then there is a timeframe on the short sell, set at the transaction. Soros is an expert at stock trading/banking. How do you think he got his wealth to begin with?

1247 2018-11-27 14:34:20 They can't prosecute you for simply knowing something before it is released into public domain unless you use it to buy or sell stocks.
1248 2018-11-27 14:34:06 Yes, there is a move to yield and and stocks like BATS. $MRK, $MCD etc ...
1249 2018-11-27 14:33:54 Of course the stocks are increasing, shareholders are happy that GM stops producing cars no one is buying. The factories are all producing large sedans, and americans rather buy the traverse and enclave SUV’s instead of the soon killed off lacrosse and impala sedans.

1253 2018-11-27 14:31:59 Commodities have tanked...  housing and autos went from dead in the water to contraction... Speculative stocks have been decapitated... Big tech has been clipped...  and productivity has turned higher.

The thing that is inflating are wages...  so, what is the Fed fighting?
1254 2018-11-27 14:31:28 Stocks are dropping, iPhones are on heavy sale here in Europe and iPhone X is back in production. I think that you should review your analysis and consider that no one is "invincible". History speaks a lot...when you start selling less hardware the company focuses on services.

1258 2018-11-27 14:30:01 @JustinTrudeau banks are getting away with murder . They are pumping and dumping stocks at will. They exploit the knowledge they have on customer positions the  rig the trades to trigger stop losses. They are crooks.

1260 2018-11-27 14:28:42 Hi Pirate. I don't trade individual stocks  (only indexes and commodities) but that's some interesting information, thank you. I also don't daytrade (tried that long ago and too painful) but do enjoy seeing your trades. Hope it works well in these trying (whipsaw) times.
1261 2018-11-27 14:28:22 car check cleared. time to buy some stocks. 

and finally merrill deposited the dividends on the right day.
1262 2018-11-27 14:28:15 This way comes.
No more equity businesses have to buy back outstanding stocks.
Interesting considering upon doing so they are now defunct of liquitable cash.
Might last 6 months but without cash to pay payroll.
Layoffs shortly after.
Literally will be on brink of collapse.

1264 2018-11-27 14:26:26 Actually, although there are not currently Bitcoin ETF's that currently trade through us, there are stocks that have representation of Bitcoin. You can do a general search for these types of companies online.  ^ZJ
1265 2018-11-27 14:25:30 I agree, but exit strategies don't work very well when stocks that have held up during a rough market & have great earnings just suddenly drop 20% in a few hours. Often has you selling where you should consider buying.

1274 2018-11-27 14:19:21 Those buying stocks today must believe Fed cycle of hiking rates is over post December 19th. If not, they either playing a dangerous game of chicken with Fed or they are confident in trading a bull market that’s been in place since 3/9/09.

1282 2018-11-27 14:14:38 It depends what you mean by “safer”.  Short term stock trading is like a 50/50 bet. But your probability of gain increases significantly the longer you own a diversified portfolio of stocks.

1300 2018-11-27 14:02:37 Dude. Research Non Profit Organizational and Non Government Organization. They’re tax exempt, 501-c3 who only have to spend 10% on their cause. 90% they pay themselves, invest in stocks-make a profit and pay no taxes. Donors use them for a tax shelter, while earning 3-5% interest

1310 2018-11-27 13:59:57 Stocks don't get safer the longer you own them. But the risk grows slower than a random walk suggests. Mean reversion matters over the long term, but it's not strong enough for market timing.

A bigger concern is that bond risk seems to grow faster than a random walk suggests.

1335 2018-11-27 13:48:57 Are fundamental stock analysts "functionally extinct"? Are they so rare that they no longer affect their environment? (see prior tweet) The rise of indexing has reduced the impact of security analysis on most individual stocks, so the stock price is not set by fundamentals.

1364 2018-11-27 13:35:38 I STRONGLY caution buying biotech right now, however, there are a fair amount of individual stocks w/potential breakouts: $ACOR $ARRY $ARGX $BLUE $DVAX $EDIT $ESPR $INCY $NVAX
1365 2018-11-27 13:35:16 Well, Ford motor company stocks should also rise. They are the next to layoff and close factories. Good job trump.

1367 2018-11-27 13:34:40 Pictet om europeiska aktier nästa år:

“[We] see limited upside for euro zone stocks next year ... not least because the Italian debt crisis has potential to escalate in the coming year at a time when the region’s economy is already slowing down.”

1370 2018-11-27 13:33:13 I have grown to respect the bulls & bull view more and get (or hope so) where many of you are coming from. I have also become more convinced that EVs are coming and sold (most of) my oil stocks. I am also bearish on the auto sector in general, but no position except Tesla.

1372 2018-11-27 13:32:45 Fundraising as a strategy to provide healthcare for all...I’d rather go with Medicare for All.  Get for-profit insurance companies out of healthcare. Healthcare is a Human Right and should never be a used for companies to be able to sell stocks.
1373 2018-11-27 13:31:54 Russia, Ruptly, RT, all laughing stocks of the world. All fabrication, all the time.
1374 2018-11-27 13:31:45 Cheap $ pumped out by Fed mostly to corporations. Recession of 08 probably never ended. Printing press made seem like that. Stocks overpriced,small guys with pensions,401Ks will take a hit. If u survived 2008 get ready bc an attack is imminent
1375 2018-11-27 13:31:27 I’ll take a little more weakness $QQQ $SPY followed by a shrug off of $AAPL tariff talk and then nice continued rebound for tech stocks $SQ $ROKU $NVDA $NFLX
1376 2018-11-27 13:30:49 FFS, get real.  The big owners who decimated the stocks took advantage of EU loans to acquire bigger boats.  And other owners sold their quota's. Pure self interest and greed in both cases and now want everybody to feel sorry for them.
1377 2018-11-27 13:30:18 I think buying stocks like these will almost certainly workouts well minus an economic crash.  But you are right in that sentiment, macro fears could drive them down even further first.  I'm averaging in, saving some cash in case we do get more downside
1378 2018-11-27 13:29:05 Perhaps you overlook that owning health care stocks is good for their health.

1382 2018-11-27 13:26:43 Tesla came into the NUMMI plant in 2010 after UAW left and then GM bailed, hired workers back, paid them more than a living wage, gave them stocks, healthcare, the whole 9 yards. Unions do good for workers generally but there is more to this story than simply pro vs anti union.
1383 2018-11-27 13:26:38 Stocks are taking a hit because of stupidity and an expanse of the windbag idiocy of this administration. They don't know WTF they are doing at all, and they have made things worse for everyone. It's just now that the idiotic policies are beginning to hit.

1403 2018-11-27 13:18:40 Large part of semi slowdown is over-ordering in Q1-Q2’18 as customers globally frontran tariffs implementation. Created blow off bubble in stocks as investors mistook for real demand growth. Now inventories are stocked full and below normal demand = stock collapse.

1408 2018-11-27 13:16:15 Future for $aapl murky but I would argue the price accounts for the added uncertainty. Same could be said for a lot of stocks that have much higher valuations and weaker balance sheets than Apple. Long and accumulating AAPL.

1) Reduce crazy overvaluation of Stocks
2) Slow down Chinese Global Threat
3) Keeping USA Safe

MSM will blame him for crashing the Market..

1479 2018-11-27 12:40:27 The only exception I can think of, and it's really unlikely, is if this financial app was doing some sort of proprietary financial modeling on device – the way they calculated stocks to buy, or something. That would be a really bad idea, but it's a reason for obfuscation.
1480 2018-11-27 12:39:35 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
1481 2018-11-27 12:39:12 There is definitely something wrong when GMs stocks go up after they announced closing plants and people losing jobs.
1482 2018-11-27 12:38:21 Stocks making the biggest move premarket: UTX, AAPL, HIBB, NVS, TSLA & more -- CNBC
1483 2018-11-27 12:37:38 Trump’s policies that are now backfiring causing lost jobs & stocks to tumble. Trump’s policies suck!

1485 2018-11-27 12:37:02 $ASNS crazy I was thinking strong about this last night as I do my nightly updates on all my stocks weird
1486 2018-11-27 12:36:53 Because you can't sell facial features.  Hats, goggles, coats, boots, stocks.  All can be sold as micro DLC.  You can add a custom face feature, but there's no revenue stream coming from that development after launch.
1487 2018-11-27 12:35:08 @realDonaldTrump Owe it to the American people to explain your little tariff war and what you are trying to accomplish. Results, slide in steel and aluminum stocks (tariffs were supposed to help) and now we are seeing serious layoffs due to increased costs. Farmers pissed, too!
1488 2018-11-27 12:34:56 GM benefited the most during the Auto bail out. Infact during the Obama adm,Government overseen GM. Now that their sales are up, Stocks are soaring they are take their profits and leaving. Rather than giving back to the Nation that saved them from embarrassing management skills.
1489 2018-11-27 12:32:53 My plan is to cut the overnights I have across the board to start at 25 % at a minimum. Stocks that were more pure overnights with no profits in them, have already cut in 1/2  NVDA  FB AAPL AMD.  I want to manage risk early so I can take advantage of a down open/price/RS/action
1490 2018-11-27 12:32:33 It'll be a matter of time #Technology #stocks bounce back (#FAANGs ). To me, so many targets on sale, including my holdings $TRXC, $CRBP, & $TPNL. These are normal fluctuations considering the long term #market #trajectory. In other words, don't be afraid to buy!

1491 2018-11-27 12:32:05 Stocks closed sharply higher on Monday.

After a strong Black Friday (and weekend), Cyber Monday looks poised to set a new record.

It was a great way to put the worst Thanksgiving trading week in 7 years behind us.
1492 2018-11-27 12:30:13 Is there any stocks left shame this lowlife
1493 2018-11-27 12:30:12 Stocks are shares of a particular company that that company sells to the public.

1495 2018-11-27 12:29:41 1000s detained at taxpayer expense near S border at prisons benefitting devos family (not to mention the cruelty of that), stocks gains erased, economists warning of recession, white nationalists empowered. If not seeing how this is good is tds, then I def have it.

1498 2018-11-27 12:27:42 Not a thing has changed - a reason to add to a position at such a discount! - Uranium market is stagnant - with general market weakness the riskier stocks get sold for liquidity - that's the only thing I can assume happened here
1499 2018-11-27 12:27:38 Agreed! There’s no way to justify supporting the horrors of this presidency. I had a friend give me the “but the stock market” argument (before it dropped) and I had to cut him off with “don’t talk to me about f**king stocks when kids are being separated from their parents”.
1500 2018-11-27 12:26:58 Stocks tumble because Trump can’t shut his mouth! Tariff war with China hurts US too! What an imbecile!

1502 2018-11-27 12:25:21 I suggest the stocks outside the pub in a Sunday lunchtime
1503 2018-11-27 12:23:31 "why can't we play with 3 stocks, instead of 2?"

1505 2018-11-27 12:23:12 I'm not sure I see the equivalence. 

Government builds the housing, & needs show no profit for it.

Private developers need a return on their investments, if they're going to add to housing stocks. 

Their absence suggests that return is not adequate, at this time/price point.
1506 2018-11-27 12:22:52 LOL, It sure doesn't seem like sworn oaths or anything else we've tried lately has persuaded most of them to honour the offices they occupy with a standard of ethical behaviour that even comes close to acceptable maybe stocks is the answer...touring ones that bring them to us!
1507 2018-11-27 12:22:33 I've been in stocks like $RDM many times Strauss.

Rob Rutherford is an excellent and proven explorer, it's simply a matter of time before something clicks in and a stock that has never been flavor of the month is everybody's darling.

It's getting closer
1508 2018-11-27 12:20:19 Ironically they’re probably litter droppers too. Public flogging then stick them in the stocks I say
1509 2018-11-27 12:19:55 If this is real, and I hope it isn't, then her husband needs to give her the ultimatum: drop this or I'll have you locked into the stocks on the public square as a warning to other ungrateful and narcissistic mothers-in-law.
1510 2018-11-27 12:19:44 How about TEACHING half the country about how to invest in stocks and their futures?
1511 2018-11-27 12:18:41 Announces lay offs and stocks go up 5%. 
1512 2018-11-27 12:16:47 No true. Most people are invested either with their 401K, or pension account. They just don’t buy stocks directly .
1513 2018-11-27 12:16:34 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your fibromyalgia
1514 2018-11-27 12:16:19 GM got a huge tax cut with your plan, bought back their own stocks, and now is laying off 15% of their workforce. Then you implement tariffs, that are just taxes on the American people, and GM lost $1bn.
@realDonaldTrump when will all this #MAGA #Winning going to stop?
1515 2018-11-27 12:15:53 If you invested 1 lakh rupees on NMB bank today and (if) it continued to grow 20% every year. Your 1 lakh rupees would be worth 40 lakhs after 20 years, even if you sold your stocks @ meager 15 PE as of today. That is wealth creation, that is power of stock investment.

1521 2018-11-27 12:10:19 @realdonaldtrump SEC needs to examine the volatile mkt trading, algorithms triggered on mkt rallies to sell mkt off. Soros tactics, he shorts countries currencies, co.s stocks and suspect he is behind trying to upset /ruin US economy.

1732 2018-11-27 08:25:26 So if NY says they can’t pay dividends as part of their deal to allow merger, how is the stock going to be that valuable for people looking for dividend payout stocks?
1733 2018-11-27 08:24:52 Wasn't designed for that. I think 2019 looks very diff for vol. for the 1st time we should see what it does elevated. It is still very tame compared to the few big spikes YTD on single events agansit months of heavy selling of stocks and blown up housing.

1738 2018-11-27 08:20:50 Even if I was immortal, I wouldn't invest in stocks with these valuations. Before 1920, even buying "high" wasn't such a blunder, because "high" only meant a couple of years until new highs in real terms. After 1920, buying "high" meant decades of 0 performance in real terms.

1843 2018-11-27 06:53:08 Stocks crashing! Yay, I guess?
1844 2018-11-27 06:50:48 Only 33 stocks in the JSE All-Share Index have generated a positive return this year!
1845 2018-11-27 06:50:44 My uncle had 300K+ in his super. After the GFC he had close to 30K. They told him they invested his super into stocks & they crashed in the GFC. Majority of his super was his own contributions from working hard for 40+ years. They continued to charge him fees after he died.
1846 2018-11-27 06:50:33 did you ever wonder what those hedgefunds will do now the nasdaq keep crashing down ? Yeah they pull money from tech stocks including crypto.
1847 2018-11-27 06:49:29 Dont worry, I have plenty compliments in stocks but I dont think I will give you easily . It's hard for me too! 
1848 2018-11-27 06:48:56 GM is taking their tax cuts and firering employees.

1851 2018-11-27 06:48:29 Interesting, I wonder why they halted the trading of stocks. The stocks went up.

1853 2018-11-27 06:48:01 Oui, l'Ursaff collecte mais les calculs sont toujours aussi mystérieux

1854 2018-11-27 06:47:42 Wish this surprised me but it sadly doesn’t. REST took out life insurance on me through my super when I was 17, they also invested my super into stocks without my knowledge. I only found out when I saw my balance go up to 20K then plummet to $800 after the GFC

1857 2018-11-27 06:43:27 Don’t forget about Harper selling off GM stocks for a song. Canada lost money because the stock went up after he sold them
1858 2018-11-27 06:41:53 The TV Broadcasters won't show the Large Crowds there though! That's too much to ask for! WLOX TV showed a handful (6 or 7) of Pres. Trump Protesters earlier today. WLOX tried to make them look like a lot more were there! They are Laughing Stocks! We love our great President!
1859 2018-11-27 06:41:50 You know when someone is Lying about stocks?

They always claim to have sold at the peak, while screaming 500k per #Bitcoin.

1862 2018-11-27 06:37:48 You realize that is “a” problem but NOT “the” problem.  I agree with you on their restriction, but bump stocks weren’t used in more than one major event.  The bigger problem is the proliferation of AR-15s and similar guns that can kill dozens in a short period of time.
1863 2018-11-27 06:37:13 “Think of it this way: The early participants in this pyramid have made a lot of money, but other people have lost”

1889 2018-11-27 06:14:27 Assuming you have 20+ years to retirement, keep a good risk adjusted asset mix. Timing the market almost never works. Think of it as a chance to buy stocks on sale 
1890 2018-11-27 06:14:21 particularly with their stocks in the toilet. might as well spend a good chunk (all) of the 2019 capex budgets on  NCIBs and debt reduction.  less work = yet another call for the federal government to wake up and get a pipeline (or three) built.

1912 2018-11-27 05:48:58 This is also due to the #ThotAudit, stocks like Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram are all falling because of whores being policed.
1913 2018-11-27 05:48:24 That’s a suspect statement. I expect well over half of Americans have some form of retirement plan like 401(k). Thus they are invested in stocks. 

What you should say is the stock market just took a big dump losing all the gains for the year and that’s Lying Donald‘s fault.

1919 2018-11-27 05:42:11 Being a “legitimate” asset has no bearing on it being in a bear market. Legitimate assets (stocks, commodities, bonds, etc) have undergone many bear markets throughout history. For example, crude oil is a legitimate market, but it doesn’t negate the current bear market.

1922 2018-11-27 05:40:11 Emerging-market currencies and stocks rose as higher U.S. equity-index futures and a rebound in oil prices bolstered demand for riskier assets. The ruble bucked the advance after Russia fired on Ukrainian warships Sunday, sparking tensions between the ex-Soviet neighbors.

1951 2018-11-27 05:16:33 Are satoshies coins circulating? No. They are still counted. Coins held by the creators of a project or company are essentially treasure shares (if we were talking stocks). Treasury shares are not included in market cap.
1952 2018-11-27 05:15:17 But if there are no buyers then stocks will drop until there are buyers and that might be awhile.

1995 2018-11-27 04:42:21 General Motors received a $514 million tax break as a result of Trump’s tax giveaway to the wealthy.But instead of using that money to raise wages, increase benefits or add more jobs it is doing the exact opposite. GM stocks went up as a result of the announcement- think about it
1996 2018-11-27 04:39:42 Yes. The nearology plays have always worked very well until it's over . Generally overshoot way too far to the upside , Gawler Craton was the best I've seen , stocks 20 and 30 bagged then back to zilch.

So $AZY stretched but as you say who cares.
1997 2018-11-27 04:38:12 I’m not leading anything. I just think it’s fascinating that your government is so good at the bait and switch. Look over here while we take advantage of you over there. Tax cuts will increase jobs and wages, but really, it’s about buying back stocks, making the rich richer.

2016 2018-11-27 04:23:01 Of course trying to intuitanything from asset prices in the short term is a fools game. Stocks might rally before the new years and all these years to date trends we obsess on will seem silly

2019 2018-11-27 04:20:24 Is this a trick question? Lol! Well... You have a bond there, but is a corporate one, which is risky...

I would then say that small cap value stocks would be the least risky after the AT&T bond that I haven't researched.

Man...
2020 2018-11-27 04:20:14 Agreed. Wall St cheerleaders who just want stocks to go higher don’t appreciate the problems w society that bad trade policies w China have caused.
2021 2018-11-27 04:19:44 Corporate greed is at fault... Stocks jumped almost 5% on the announcements today. I feel for these and all workers across Canada that have had been impacted by global multinationals and their cost cutting measures. They should have to pay back the loans.

2082 2018-11-27 03:38:34 I'm not a tariff expert but for Canadian production why not buy American steel to get around the tariff? I remember we bail those greedy assholes out way before Trump was around. End of year closures stocks spike shareholders happy and big bonuses.
2083 2018-11-27 03:38:34 That’s good to know. Follow-up: in my stock trading account I see a “TFSA account”. I imagine I just buy stocks in that account and I’m done? Or is there some additional steps involved in making the stock purchase part of the TFSA?
2084 2018-11-27 03:37:36 Oh! I've  lost big time on real est.
Started 2007 convinced by friends, prices on the high side. Went all in. Then 2008 come crashing down & down, 2009 down again, 2010 working for the "MAN," took 2 more yrs to pay off the remaining debt

Little gun shy now, soft into stocks now
2085 2018-11-27 03:36:51 I'm genuinely curious what was your previous role at JP Morgan like, given your penchant to discuss stocks. Were you in IB or PE research?
2086 2018-11-27 03:36:39 2001 (dotcom bubble) - “Man I wish I would have invest in tech stocks”

2009 (housing bubble) - “Ah I should have invested in the housing market”

2019 (crypto/blockchain bubble) - “Oh man I wish I would have invested in crypto”

ITS NOT TOO LATEBUY
2087 2018-11-27 03:36:22 This is why the stock exchange keeps talking massive dips. The billionaires / millionaires that love democrats keep selling their stocks short and they buy back when the stock surges. It is a smart move to make money and it happens all the time.

Thanks for the story.
2088 2018-11-27 03:35:02 Nope, I drink responsibly most of my investing is into my 401k then keep a good amount of cash in high interest saving account. Like you said investing is luck so when I buy stocks/crypto is on the hopes I get lucky.
2089 2018-11-27 03:34:33 Nasa has stocks on Nasdaq?
2090 2018-11-27 03:34:26 That’s Thailand, though, so they’re more than welcome to abominate their pizza in any way they please. We don’t have an overabundance of durian trees here, so people don’t need to get creative in finding ways to use up the remaining stocks. 
2091 2018-11-27 03:34:24 It has nothing to do with us very true.

But the facts that media cant report accurate information is funny.

As for news it will be nice to know if new group will be under BH or CJ/BH.

BH may go public so news are important for potential investors who will want to buy stocks.

2096 2018-11-27 03:32:57 The truth is people are not buying Cars. People are buying vans and trucks the reason for GM stocks being higher. Democrats never tell the truth. The plants closing are where their cars are produced. All about demand

2100 2018-11-27 03:30:58 Definitely check on the old 401k. Usually younger folks are encouraged to be heavy in stocks. Not good if the market drops (which it’s on track to do).
2101 2018-11-27 03:29:08 What happen to the law that prohibited  a mentally ill person from owning a gun?

What happened to the ban on bump stocks?

Most Dems don't want to take guns away... shit I need mine in this fucked up  country, but I don't want crazy people like you having one!!!!
2102 2018-11-27 03:28:34 Which sector Sir or specific stocks?
2103 2018-11-27 03:28:05 So Vvix takes inputs from options on Vix and Vix uses Sox options. So if vvix is dropping at a greater degree than Vix the that implies traders are  expecting less vol (swings) in Vix than in equities. Signs of bullishness to stocks, rightly so or not is left to be determined....
2104 2018-11-27 03:28:01 Matt Rafalko taught me how to buy stocks in weed.
2105 2018-11-27 03:27:53 Totally agree! I'm not sure how far I would have gotten in life if it weren't for my teachers - especially grade school!

2125 2018-11-27 03:12:04 It’s pretty hard to overstate the impact Robert Covington has had defensively over his first 7 games as a Wolf. 28 total stocks! Completely different tone and energy on that end. RoCo is creating tons of extra opportunities.
2126 2018-11-27 03:11:38 One fairly dependable sign of the approaching end of a bull swing is the fact that new common stocks of small and nondescript companies are offered at prices somewhat higher than the current level for many medium-sized companies with a long market history. very true by benjamin
2127 2018-11-27 03:11:38 Bank Nifty Setup 
Positive setup but time to go opposite at higher levels. Traders have smartly accumulated lot of long put positions. Brace for strong resistance at 26450-600 area. 

26050-26500 range for bank nifty

2133 2018-11-27 03:09:00 Then you start a trade war with China? Impose steel tariffs on a number of countries? Now we will start to see the REAL Donald #Trump economy. One based on HIS decisions. He won't be able to cut corporate taxes again. Stocks are headed down and the fall will be painful.
2134 2018-11-27 03:07:11 The macro factors that could save stocks, would be a fresh trade deal between the U.S. & China, which some anticipate could come this week when President Donald Trump & Chinese President Xi Jinping cross paths at the G-20 summit, or a pause in Fed interest rate hike schedule

2143 2018-11-27 03:04:38 Chart observations:
technical damage in many sectors & ind names remain
the next trend could be "sideways" for a bit (rather than up / down)

Strategy:
Owning stocks vs options - no theta decay & maturity in stocks, imo stocks more suitable for trendless / sideways mkt
2144 2018-11-27 03:04:22 Not fair. This poll prolly asked some GM workers. It should've asked the shareholders as stocks soared and they were laughing all the way to the bank.

2147 2018-11-27 03:01:54 At least we are trying. Better than nothing. But the people at the shelter should get $5 each a day. Free the slaves. But there is no one world currency. Stocks is unfair and this is a majority of our debt.
2148 2018-11-27 02:59:41 Agree that a real company can screw up and have a drunk captain and poor oversight. But then there are consequences...stocks plummet, CEOs are fired and costly lawsuits are paid out.  Who holds a socialist “company” accountable when the government “owns” policing, judge and jury?
2149 2018-11-27 02:59:26 Stocks are going to fly in this game. 3 stocks seems like the push.
2150 2018-11-27 02:59:10 all these kill set ups happenin at 40% , makin me think we boutta hit 4-5 stocks meta real quick
2151 2018-11-27 02:57:33 Yes. You’ve bean bearish. But you seem to hedge and get short term bullish usually after a short-term move like today. Now you’re saying we may see another 4% upside and you’re also recommending some retail stocks that popped pretty nicely today. But yet, you’re bearish.
2152 2018-11-27 02:56:27 The bitcoin network is used hundreds of thousands of times daily. Must be valuable. But it's not fancy like stocks. Its job isn't to make you money! It's just the world's cheapest/fastest/most secure transaction method plus a better gold.

2155 2018-11-27 02:53:19 it's funny how stocks with a messianic narcissist CEO turn people sour at one another.
2156 2018-11-27 02:52:48 Stocks are not doing well. There actually is little (except perhaps unemployment rate) that Trump can actually brag about on the subject of the economy. This is where Dems are failing: by not pointing out that all this good economy talk from Trump is all just hoopla.

2158 2018-11-27 02:52:10 Let's refer to what's known as "value stocks" over "growth stocks" globally. 

Value stocks refer to listed companies that are trading at a price below where some think it should be, while growth stocks are firms that are seen to have a lot of potential to grow.
2159 2018-11-27 02:51:33 I know. I'm from Ohio. Hey, but GM stocks went up today. 14,700 unemployed but investors are happy.
2160 2018-11-27 02:51:29 Repeating : why would stocks go UP ? Seems like massive layoffs translate into company instability or a need for greater capital? I don’t get it -
2161 2018-11-27 02:51:01 Thanks for the refresher. I forgot that Mulroney introduced the GST to help offset Canada’s ballooning deficit. It was one factor that led to his dramatic drop in popularity.
At the time, BOC attempted high interest rates to create 0% inflation; almost crippled the CAN economy.
2162 2018-11-27 02:50:07 Crypto, housing, stocks, bonds...the "everything bubble" is coming to an end.
2163 2018-11-27 02:49:02 Does that seem odd to anyone besides me ??? I would have thought that closing up shop and  major lay offs would translate to  business instability : so why would stocks go up ?
2164 2018-11-27 02:47:44 If I was the CEO, which I am not, because I am not a selfish evil greedy bastard, I will tell my shareholders to keep reminding themselves that they are purchasing shares of common stocks,  which is supposed to be speculative, with no guarantees. don’t like it?sell the shares.

2174 2018-11-27 02:44:05 Yes. And we live in such a values upside down world, that when this was announced, their share price rose. smh I am old enough to remember a time when layoff announcements made stocks tank, plus the best applicants would not work for your company. RTing.

2178 2018-11-27 02:42:42 Im refering to any stocks with high debt and low earnings. Stage one and two of the turning take time. With high debt level, it dont take long for the horrible fin report to kill the stock. Without debt, the dillution still make the stock alive until the stage three of the boom.

2180 2018-11-27 02:40:10 Recent strategy was full size index shorts, sprinkling in small longs.

Now it's small quick trades w/ no direction bias--->until next big signal.

Ideally big signal is bearish again, but at the end of the day direction doesn't matter as long as signal is strong.

2192 2018-11-27 02:32:24 Yeah it has to do with stocks that pay dividends. Some portion is withheld. Though Google doesn’t pay dividends so it might be a good buy at the moment for my TFSA (tax free savings account)
2193 2018-11-27 02:30:12 Dude next to me checking stocks. I need to be on his level 
2194 2018-11-27 02:30:11 I have been trying to tell that to anyone who will listen for years now, telling me the DOW is up is only saying rich people is making money, I am middle class homeowner and I own no stocks, I have a mortgage and lots of debts, buying stocks is not an option 
2195 2018-11-27 02:29:09 You do know AR stocks can be swapped out. Shit they even make solid wood ones.
2196 2018-11-27 02:28:45 Thinking about consolidating the portfolio a bit and see possible run up as great opportunity. Only 4 stocks I want to own.
2197 2018-11-27 02:27:42 Buying stocks like Japan
2198 2018-11-27 02:26:46 I wouldn't be net short here. There are groups like semis that could be up 50-100% in the melt-up.  Right now everyone is assuming the cycle is over. If the Fed realizes they've already gone to far, you will see semis & housing stocks really jump.
2199 2018-11-27 02:25:40 What they don't like is "Call out culture" when it puts their way of life (pedophilia, incest, and corporate welfare) on the line. Everything else they will "call out" and mark to eventually put people in the stocks or burn them at the stake.

2207 2018-11-27 02:20:33 Question for Canadian tax experts, clear up a few things for me...

1) Can I self-direct a TFSA with stocks?

2) US stocks are subject to a withholding fee if they pay dividends. Can I drop some money in GOOG (which doesn't pay divs) and keep all the gainz?

3) Can I put GBTC in?
2208 2018-11-27 02:19:59 The stock market is rising. So the economy is doing great?
No, its because companies are buying back their own stocks back.
Our economy is so effed. This is why we have Trump.
2209 2018-11-27 02:19:20 Investing in high market value stocks not the best strategy!

2212 2018-11-27 02:17:34 Your other triggers on stocks were >a prior day's high, why not use the same type of entry for indexes? Nothing is gonna go anywhere till the "M" bottoms out & we get a valid follow thru day IMHO! :) So, just wondering how come the different strategy for an index versus a stock?
2213 2018-11-27 02:16:24 Depends upon the asset class. Deflation in bonds (higher rates). Deflation is stocks, actually a collapse. Reflation in stuff. Commodities. Gold. Bust will lead to realization that Central Banks are fucked. Weimar is the only way out. Asset holders will awaken to this fact.

2218 2018-11-27 02:13:57 It’s coming. New housing construction starts are being delayed in my area and we’ve been booming for years. Also, the most recent rebalancing my fund advisor made in my retirement accounts moved out of stocks and into bonds.
2219 2018-11-27 02:13:36 this is true. we may see a finish bull run in stocks, but it will tank well below current levels either way. (-) inflation. 
BTC <3k is blood imo.  (+) deflation.
2220 2018-11-27 02:12:46 like + follow! ;-). CBs quit printig cheap debt so is anybody supprised here? Fiat is a fraud that is why #Bitcoin rises 3 of 4 years. Anyway, great analysis been telling my colleges to sell their stocks since january. The question that remains is, how will it affect BTC price?
2221 2018-11-27 02:12:09 Looks like markets have anticipated that there won't be any deal between US and China in tradewar

2223 2018-11-27 02:09:09 Sounds like a bad business strategy. Nazis have money to spend as well. How many people can you ban before it hurts you more than it's worth? Don't these companies have share holders? Don't "the agreeable people" also have stocks & retirement accounts that depend on commerce?

2240 2018-11-27 01:58:32 Mike, I'm finding quite a few stocks that have gotten so cheap that I am buying regardless of the broad market.  Value buyers usually stop a market downturn by stepping in regardless of technicals, so think this may be starting.  Will do well unless recession

2296 2018-11-27 01:12:02 Pay attention to what Trump hits at. When those stocks fall, BUY!!! They always recovers, balance out, and sometimes even do better than before. I call that the Trump Effect (ie, Nike a few months back! LOVED that!!)
2297 2018-11-27 01:11:39 I believe what you are referring to is investment growth. It's like saying, I spent $1000 on stocks this year that I think will be profitable in 5 years. It's an upfront tax spending loss on a future bet. Question is do you spend that $1000 on your bff @gop cronies or #Americans?
2298 2018-11-27 01:10:57 GM employees can be and likely are also shareholders. If not of GM, of other stocks. Also, GM stock is down 16% from July of this year. This is classic political rhetoric. That is to say, short-sighted and not totally honest.
2299 2018-11-27 01:10:31 People act on emotions too easily and I LOVE it! It makes me more money in the market. When “good stocks” start to drop, people freak and sell, causing it to fall further...and I come in  don’t buy when it’s raising. Statistically, nothing raises forever.

2312 2018-11-27 01:00:10 No different then the filthy rich Republicans gave Big tax breaks so they could buy stocks instead of increasing their workers wages,no different then the GOP BS they've been laying out since Trump started running their sorry as***, so plug it.
2313 2018-11-27 00:59:54 GM closing plants. Here it comes... sell
your stocks... buy all the canned food that’s left on the shelves...  the real winter is nigh...
2314 2018-11-27 00:58:06 Or the days we had three million plus, unemployed.
And double figure mortgage interest.
Mass privatisation.
Deregulation of banking.
Selling off council housing stocks.
The poll tax.
2315 2018-11-27 00:58:00 Is the capital markets department allowed to notify the research department about upcoming offerings on stocks that are covered by the bank's research analysts?
2316 2018-11-27 00:56:43 How did you select these stocks? What are the filters applied?
2317 2018-11-27 00:56:30 Lol pleasantly surprised Stephen sounds like a great teacher. Thanks for the info, def learned some new stuff!
2318 2018-11-27 00:56:19 Please stick to stocks and trades 
2319 2018-11-27 00:55:55 Zerodha offers from 5 to 20 times depending on stocks and order types on intra-day trading.
2320 2018-11-27 00:55:34 I'm all into US stocks. Can't even begin to guess on Canopy. Just depends too much on dilution, cost to enter US, etc...I'm gonna say somewhere between 60 and 600. Not helpful I know.
2321 2018-11-27 00:55:11 @Tzrstar7 Im always bullish on them (I do not short stocks), but they do not always work out exactly as planned
2322 2018-11-27 00:54:58 In other news, aluminum foil stocks are rising as more conspiracies are thrown out there.
2323 2018-11-27 00:53:08 The majority of Americans don't have nor care about stocks. Every day Americans care about their paychecks and 14K GM employees will lose their jobs in short time. So much for his tax law creating and retaining American jobs.
2324 2018-11-27 00:52:58 What about all the retired senior's who had GM's stocks. And wer left high and dry nothing for their stock's when Obama bailed GM out.
2325 2018-11-27 00:51:38 Stocks, jobs, taxes, GDP & now securring the border -- anything else is totally irrelevant
2326 2018-11-27 00:51:37 Well said. 99% of the average retail investors are out. Leaving room for the bigger fish to come in. This is so similar to the dotcom boom where retail investors essentially sold blue chip stocks at a fraction of what they are worth today. Patience wins.
2327 2018-11-27 00:51:07 I'm not buying anything right now (except #litecoin) but if I were buying stocks I would buy #overstock $OSTK and Marathon Patent Group - and most especially today $CRSP #crispr since they just immunized babies from HIV for life with it #crisprbabies
2328 2018-11-27 00:51:05 Stocks go up and down. Nothing new.
2329 2018-11-27 00:50:48 Ils sont jamais vides tes stocks de bisous, c'est génial 
2330 2018-11-27 00:50:43 One can hope. @Vic_Neufeld has done a terrible job running @aphriainc. 

@nuuvera was a terrible purchase by Aphria, and its looking like American stocks will leave this dud in the dust.
2331 2018-11-27 00:49:23 Time to buy stocks in apple. ;)
2332 2018-11-27 00:49:12 Their stocks soar because they took financial incentives from tRUMP and are buying back their own stocks! They can't do that and handle tariffs, and American employees all at the same time! China here comes GM!
2333 2018-11-27 00:48:52 Easy day for us since we spent time already last week positioning into what I considered to be select stocks like $SQ $LABU $ROKU $JDST etc.
2334 2018-11-27 00:48:25 My stocks are up 40% since the election and our borders are safe. He understands it very well
2335 2018-11-27 00:47:47 My friends & family that are or were military dislike automatic weapons in the hands of civilians. Bump stocks are still legal btw.
2336 2018-11-27 00:45:26 Don't buy individual stocks!
2337 2018-11-27 00:44:44 When the price falls enough, Trump buys in. Then announces he's pulling out of the proposed tariffs and stocks rebound. He's playing with it.
2338 2018-11-27 00:44:40 Someone talk to me about stocks.
2339 2018-11-27 00:44:33 $ACB as crazy HIGH #cannabis stocks were October, they are CRAZY LOW now in November
2340 2018-11-27 00:44:17 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
2341 2018-11-27 00:43:57 $AAPL $BTC.X $CGC If your focus is too much on stocks like these, you're likely missing other good trades i.e. $SQ $LABU $SHOP $JDST  etc.
2342 2018-11-27 00:43:40 $2,000,000 invested in dividend paying stocks and bonds should yield $60,000 - $80,000 per year.  You keep the principal and live on the yield and I think you could have your dinner every night.
2343 2018-11-27 00:43:00 DRIFE stocks up fresh baits to its structure users contributing towards the platform's betterment through community interaction and system structure @Drife_official
2344 2018-11-27 00:42:13 My husband got a pay cut from the Fed Reserve Bank in NYC, as everyone knows, things are happening there. We are lucky he has a job, but his pay cut barely gets us by in NYC. We do have stocks, but we’ve been selling them off to get by. It’s so fn scary for all of us!!
2345 2018-11-27 00:41:54 Been saying it for a year now. Get your money out of stocks, put it in the bank, and wait for this sucker to spiral downward. Then go buy something nice at a discount.
2346 2018-11-27 00:41:33 Each player will start with a traditional 50 stocks, or 'lives',
2347 2018-11-27 00:40:56 Workers are not allowed to own stocks in the company they work for?
I had no idea...doesn't seem fair.
#LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
2348 2018-11-27 00:40:39 Hard to time but very close! I feel the same way with stocks. I can’t wait to own many more great companies!
2349 2018-11-27 00:40:21 I heard today that the plants GM is going to discontinue was because those plants produce sadans and smaller cars which are not selling like they use to. Of course I am sure the tariffs play a part in this but when they announced this move their stocks increased, so who knows
2350 2018-11-27 00:40:00 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2351 2018-11-27 00:37:52 #oil stocks starting to break lows/opening prices, market almost flat.....  bit of negativity creeping in here! $STO $OSH $BPT
2352 2018-11-27 00:37:50 President Donald Trump's last week I told you General Motors would be making this announcement,& I also told you China will be making an announcement. I told you about the stock market,& the worst day for stocks are yet to come,& if you do not believe it look through my tweets..
2353 2018-11-27 00:37:43 Yes agree. 

As someone who has been around a fraction of the time you have though I can say it's not easy to learn conviction in stocks that are slow moving and noone cares about. 

Reading your tweets are always great reminders of what being a value investor is about, so thanks
2354 2018-11-27 00:37:05 He’s a blow hard.
     And I wouldn’t be surprised if Trump and a LOT of 1%ers knew about what was going to happen and are making money from stocks.
      Trump might be pretending to be tough on them to throw off suspicion.
2355 2018-11-27 00:35:38 European stocks rose on Monday, buoyed by a rebound in oil prices and an easing of budget tensions between the EU and Italy's populist government.
2356 2018-11-27 00:35:30 Capitalism: Laying-off 15,000 workers = soaring stocks. 

At least the people who clean the toilets and build the yachts for the rich will be "trickled-down" on.

2360 2018-11-27 00:32:56 Your friend Jim Cramer is calling this a bear. Many stocks are in bear market territory.
2361 2018-11-27 00:32:27 WOW...Trump is smart... threaten Apple, stocks crashes, trump buys cheap stocks..rescinds threat...stocks skyrockets...makes big money
2362 2018-11-27 00:30:49 More like $150 for a 32" HD TV. Just saying.
Where I grew up, no one had cable. No one. We got it when I was about 14 years old and I was a neighborhood celeb for awhile. I would guess none of my friends from childhood have stocks . . . most can't even buy a home.
2363 2018-11-27 00:30:18 As we told them they wouldn't. They insisted that companies were going to pass those tax benefits on to workers. We told them the bulk of companies wouldn't do this, but would buy-back stocks and pay shareholder dividends.

2367 2018-11-27 00:26:42 Jobs are going away bigtime, stocks have lost a whole years worth of profit, the deficit is going to bankrupt us as a country! Good job crooked GOP!!!!
2368 2018-11-27 00:25:27 Sweet news. This also means any asset connected to XRP through the Interledger can now be used for retail payments. Imagine filling up on gasoline with your AAPL stocks or buying a steak with silver bullion.

Now we need the Interledger wallet. (@EdgeWallet ?)
2369 2018-11-27 00:23:48 Market is off to a good start this week and here are the stocks that have spiked my interest: $ETSY, $I, $TTD, $TWLO.
2370 2018-11-27 00:23:20 Financial planner I know was telling me recently that despite his advice only 20% of his rrsp clients go for ethical investments. The rest are sticking with oil stocks. That’s going to be interesting when it backfires on them.
2371 2018-11-27 00:23:04 Please stop that. I am 100% democrat but this type of talk is why people don't vote for Dems. It's a free market. People get hired. People get fired. Stocks go up. Stocks go down.
2372 2018-11-27 00:23:03 Market low last year was 19,000. It has topped 26,000 this year.  You are getting bad info. 2 yrs ago Apple was at 92, its double that now. Do some research. Stocks are skyrocketing....

2374 2018-11-27 00:22:14 Cyber Monday stocks rise, led by shares of retailers as shoppers spent billions of dollars online and Thanksgiving weekend
2375 2018-11-27 00:21:32 "If you don't think that cryptocurrencies are like stocks, it's not me who hasn't understood the market as you said, but you who hasn't understood the economy" 
What a guy on telegram just told me. 
2376 2018-11-27 00:19:58 Pensions are broke nation wide.  Only CA has a surplus.  the stock market is going to crash, soon.  and all the 401K's are in stocks.   American is swimming in debt.  American's are living on plastic and won't be able to pay that either soon.  pity the upcoming generations.
2377 2018-11-27 00:19:49 FANG stocks $FB, $AMZN, $NFLX, $GOOGL moves today on below average to average volume
2378 2018-11-27 00:19:05 But...stocks went up today, so the fat cats made tons more money while the workers got Pink slips!!

2380 2018-11-27 00:17:58 I'm saving my $$$ to meet you, so stocks are out of the question. 
2381 2018-11-27 00:17:38 Obama saved Bankruptcy bound GM(stocks became worthless)GM says it lost $1B&OH plant workers soon laid offbc of Trump tariffs War!No surprise,our Bankruptcy Genius,a racist filled with hatred for Obama is driven to undo everything”O”did,AUTO,IRAN,EPA,ACA,now-covers for Vlad,BSM
2382 2018-11-27 00:17:14 I'm trying to get through a huge set of banking books. So. Boring. This I hope will help me with my job, I need to understand the stocks as I am a bondsman!! Wall Street banking can be very competitive #watchout #studyhard #grindSZN
2383 2018-11-27 00:16:38 #GM cut more than 14k jobs today & #Trump is throwing a fit. Did he really think handing them a $150M tax cut would help? The top executives just made a whole lot of $ with their stocks increasing by 6%, but everyone else got canned. Trickle down.  @realDonaldTrump
2384 2018-11-27 00:14:56 Bro you should have yelled CAILIN!!!! That's my girl princess of stocks
2385 2018-11-27 00:14:22 So I went ahead and started buying some stocks. Figured why not start trying to invest.

God fucking damnit I'm old.

I USED TO SKATEBOARD!
2386 2018-11-27 00:13:30 My stocks boomin 
2387 2018-11-27 00:12:52 Lol he stocks shelves?
2388 2018-11-27 00:11:54 Rs#3 will consist of 1.5 stocks
2389 2018-11-27 00:11:42 Worst mechanic fo sure, won’t be as bad w 3 stocks tho
2390 2018-11-27 00:10:44 And considering that the Government of Canada (no matter which party forms the govt at any time) has the luxury of having ALL the time in the world to wait before it sells, this was really stupid

The GoC could've held the stocks for an unlimited number of years had it wanted to
2391 2018-11-27 00:08:02 That or illegal again. Idk it just seems dangerous to artificially inflate stocks when you could invest those profits into actual expansion to increase real value. But I would be happy with this I guess.
2392 2018-11-27 00:06:45 I thought the goal was to make money in the stocks market, not loose your ass! People can’t even secure enough for their retirement with these stupid negative swings. #NotaCorrection #Meltdown #ThePoorPersonsInvestment
2393 2018-11-27 00:06:09 No, institutional investors don't want volatility. Of course not 
A guy with $10M can put $100k to BTC and don't give a shit about volatility, and can make more money with the next BR than with $1M in FANG stocks.
2394 2018-11-27 00:05:42 Santorum owns energy stocks. He stands to benefit from Trump's policies. Santorum is a Faux Catholic.
2395 2018-11-27 00:04:06 Girl it’s the best thing ever! If your company has stocks I suggest buying someone. I did that with my old company and I made money for 8years and didn’t realize it until last year because I completely forgot.
2396 2018-11-27 00:01:39 The stocks are not doing well. They are down quite a bit
2397 2018-11-27 00:00:07 Except they are a privately owned company with publically traded stocks. The only way to get a flea in their ear is to stop buying their stocks. Thry could care less about the actual users.
