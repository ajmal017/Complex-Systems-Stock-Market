3 2018-11-18 23:28:15 Yes. Trump is creating new competition for US farmers. Not just soybeans - pork, beef, seafood, poultry, certain produce, and corn in a big way. Trump’s tariffs are the best thing that ever happened to S American and S Asian producers

And then there’s oil/commodities, mfg goods-
4 2018-11-18 23:12:01 What Fallout 4 and 76 have taught me is that after the apocalypse, glue and screws will be the most valuable commodities in existence, and I should really start stockpiling thousands of them now.
5 2018-11-18 23:06:19 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
6 2018-11-18 23:00:23 I don’t have beef with polyamory as a concept but I have beef with so many of y’all treating people and your relationships to them like commodities
7 2018-11-18 22:36:47 He instituted tariffs, which cause commodities to be more expensive.  He’s insulted our military allies in Europe.
8 2018-11-18 22:34:34 Most men are at least subtly sexist due to years of modeling which has taught them that women are commodities here only to serve them. Any woman who defies that teaching is therefore a challenge to their entire worldview and just makes their head hurt which makes them lash out.
9 2018-11-18 22:28:26 I was told from the pulpit basically the whole time I was in church if “my husband doesn’t get food at home he’ll go for takeout. Because women are reduced to commodities. It’s harmful.
10 2018-11-18 22:26:56 This guy is one of those types who doesn’t actually see women as people, just commodities who fall somewhere on an attractiveness scale. I always assume men like this don’t actually know what it’s like to have a real partnership with someone. It’s pathetic.
11 2018-11-18 22:21:07 2 trades. 2TRADES! Messed up the whole year. Ah well. Think I could have stuck it out and really contended, but I got some commodities back for the future which wouldn't have been guaranteed post season... Worked for both of us. And @rkjenkins07
12 2018-11-18 22:16:58 This tweet is bad. The global commodities market doesn't really care where the beans are from. This just means that we get a lower price until trump is gone

14 2018-11-18 21:57:41 Not true. I’m obviously not a fan of Trump’s trade tactics, but commodities markets are malleable. Soybean demand can return as quickly as it left if the price and other conditions are right.
15 2018-11-18 21:53:50 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.
16 2018-11-18 21:52:12 Power burn on NG already dropping last few days so demand destruction has started.  Last three days are off 20 percent off the 30 day average.  And yes storage is a bit lower but production growing in 8-9 percent range. Like most commodities the cure for high prices is hi prices
17 2018-11-18 21:51:20 I asked you last week if you are bullish in something. I read you too much bearish on equities and commodities.

36 2018-11-18 21:50:28 short international long us; short speculative long boring; short debt long divi's; short currency long us dollar; short commodities etc. etc.
37 2018-11-18 21:48:32 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
38 2018-11-18 21:32:16 money buys the commodities that you think give you happiness. As you get older those things you use money for become more expensive, keeping you in a cycle of “i wish i made more money” without true knowledge on what to do with that money
39 2018-11-18 21:30:43 Te cuento:para Macri no hay dinero para hacerlo, sin embargo la Argentina resignó fondos en su momento bajando impuestos a las exportaciones de la soja y eliminando la de otros commodities. La respuesta se cae sola, desperdiciaron recursos provenientes de sectores pudientes.

41 2018-11-18 21:25:22 Sunday night calls, corn steady up 1 , soybeans steady down 1 , wheat mixed up 1. Positive seasonals around  #Thanksgiving, China/ US talks 8 trading days  away. Funds short wheat/soybeans #long corn
42 2018-11-18 21:24:15 From DAY ONE - .@FLGovScott =TRUMPIST= .@POTUS supporter. Is this REALLY kind of America we want? Leaders NON-CREDIBLE w LYING (WAPO), HATEFUL DIVIDING (NYT), CRUEL (sep'd families, #DACA, PR), USE PEOPLE as COMMODITIES -use & discard W/O COMPASSION, SEEKING WEALTH @ ANY COST ..
43 2018-11-18 21:13:51 My bud suggested that. At some point the effort becomes too demanding or fruitless. So many ways and places we're being turned into commodities and covertly funneled. So little real regulation, oversight or resistance, the end may come as complacent dystopia or chaotic revolution
44 2018-11-18 21:07:27 You can only talk of next level if you have built well an initial level, hopefully not next level in poverty, loss of jobs, Fulani herdsmen/BH mayhem, corruption with impunity, hike in price of PMS and other commodities etc
45 2018-11-18 20:22:26 Oh I would venture 80% of the derivative market is fueled by two molecules: THC and CBD. Inherently commodities. It’s the other 20% I’m interested in 
46 2018-11-18 20:13:58 If I may add though, could you elaborate more on which type of commodities you think will perform better next year?
Thanks again for all the tips
47 2018-11-18 20:10:47 @jlppfeffer Curious about this bit: "things can have financial value for one of three reasons: it's a claim on a cash flow, it's money or it's a collectible."
How do commodities fit into this framework? And would gold then qualify as a collectible under this framework?
48 2018-11-18 20:05:40 ma, remember that under GEJ, a bag was sold for 6k. @atiku has been in govt & is currently running one of the biggest businesses in Africa, with that kind of experience, he could fix the economy. So rice & other essential commodities 'll be affordable.
49 2018-11-18 20:00:47 @ClayCollins killer piece and thread! Thank you for putting it together.

Maybe I'm missing something, but if we all agree that these projects are non-productive bearer assets, why wouldn't we borrow & apply best practice valuation frameworks from currencies & commodities?
50 2018-11-18 19:56:59 What simple questions? Like, what is your dispute?

it's never not hilarious when people whose ideology is "number go up" or "buy my coin" can't think of a worse thing to say about me than "but you make money!"

sure I do, but only by giving value - not selling crypto commodities
51 2018-11-18 19:52:44 On Sunday, Forex markets in West open at 5PM ET, the $USD opens with commodities at STI Singapore at 6PM ET

#gold and #silver are usually overstated in the EAST, London takes over later with firmer prices.  $USD opens about 7 PM

I use USD/CAD as filter for $USD, now + 0.0013
52 2018-11-18 19:46:18 You can't be just by not comparing the prices of the aforementioned commodities when the PDP took over in 99 and when they left in 2015. Coz the indomie generation will not understand the damages PDP done to this once a great country.
53 2018-11-18 19:35:31 Keep campaigning Modi g but how people gonna vote for you with such high rising prices of commodities , e.g Gas cylinder reaches to 950 RS.
It's as simple as you emotional tricks on people's.
54 2018-11-18 19:33:14 So we Africans need to get off our 3rd world butts and manufacture the commodities currently manufactured overseas using raw materials supplied by Africa. Let Africa join the 1st World instead of bitching about it.  Until then we're consumers, dependant upon 1st world capital.
55 2018-11-18 19:17:00 In a lot of places and industries, yeah it is. It's ALL about the companies today. Workers are pretty much disposable commodities.
56 2018-11-18 19:16:28 A diferença está na prioridade de investimentos. O Brasil sempre teve tradição em pouco investimento com a saúde, ciência e tecnologia. Já Cuba investe massivamente e exporta o serviço. O Brasil prefere investir em commodities na balança do PIB
57 2018-11-18 19:11:14 Climate change - it feels the focus gets lost on this raking crap and the debate over forest management. I'd like to bring the focus to the root of the cause - the Oil Companies and oil commodities, which I do not understand but I am trying. 
 Yes? @ellyn_gesell
58 2018-11-18 19:08:08 Acho que todos desconhecem como funciona o mercado de tecnologia e consultoria no mundo. A lógica é capitalista. As firmas de consultoria contratam os especialistas e pagam apenas de 1% a 10% do recebido pelo cliente. Enquanto uns exportam commodities outros exportam serviços
59 2018-11-18 18:41:56 Why would China be against floating the currency once they have the ability to import commodities using CNY? USD losing reserve status means losing ability to price commodities using their own dime.
60 2018-11-18 18:34:59 So Zimbabwe's troubles are now spilling over to football , first it was the the abnormal price increase of basic commodities , bus accidents and now the Warriors get beaten , something is going on in Zimbabwe , vhanaMagaya this is where your help is needed #AFCON2019Q
61 2018-11-18 18:24:27 No disagreements there. Cryptos are a really unique commodity money. Most commodities increase in supply as value rises which decreases volatility. Bitcoin has no such mechanism. I therefore question whether it can ever truly be a money in the traditional sense.
62 2018-11-18 18:21:59 Most likely he didnt.  He preached diversifying into 8 different commodities.  The root cause is complex but key factors causing the demise is a complex combination of selling naked, big losses on crude oil sell puts, too early sell NG calls, big vega explosions. He’s a veteran.
63 2018-11-18 18:20:26 You absolutely do the same for us, Jan.
Sanity and reason seem to be rare commodities at time. Then there's folks like you.
*sigh*
64 2018-11-18 18:10:54 Are you for real? Charge more for basic commodities when there are millions out there at present who can’t afford to feed their families.
65 2018-11-18 17:57:36 4/ The remnant trickle down to the  people. Also, politicians swindle govt by getting import waivers and they sell cheap to recover their loot and you say things are cheap. Reality set in now because they can't do that sh*t anymore and commodities become expenses and you cry foul
66 2018-11-18 17:53:38 Nowadays Span+Exposure blocked for option writing, which has huge investment with profit is limited but carries huge risk of unlimited loss which can blow ur account.
Instead commodities segment (only) base metals is more safe with CONSISTENT profit, less risk & less investment.
67 2018-11-18 17:52:44 Who is this some bloke from the. UN he said yes he has listened to 300 submissions From individuals groups Local authorities on the impacts of. Austerity increasing poverty food bank use living side-by-side with gross inequality homes as commodities whilst homelessness escalates
68 2018-11-18 17:51:30 However, investments is based on 100% forecast of commodities in agricultural sector, but sometimes forecast can be given wrong estsmate due to constraints such as flood, drought any other calamities, now the question is how farmers are protected by financial policies?
69 2018-11-18 17:39:22 Sure.  Send me ur mail id.

Also send ur whatsapp number.  Will explain the techniques in  commodities segment for FREE.

I will bet,  after that u will never ever trade in options in equities. 

Looking forward for ur reply.
70 2018-11-18 17:29:16 My points exactly.  Made several comments that regulators are allowing a wait-and-see approach.  They don't want to hinder technology and progress.  Utility driven commodities are real weather Doc Craig believes them or not.  If utilities hadn't come along it might've been BAD.
71 2018-11-18 17:24:53 O país com maior IDH da América Latina é justamente o mais liberal, Peru e o Paraguai que vem caminhando nesse mesmo sentido também, não se deixe enganar por um governo que surfou nas ondas das commodities, a China não vai entrar na OMC de novo.
72 2018-11-18 17:09:56 If any president, in fact any body in Nigeria can tackle the issue of food (high prices of commodities) in Nigerian markets then such a person is already won the war against poverty.
73 2018-11-18 16:58:57 Early on xrp did have a lot of similarities to a security.  the SEC took a wait and see approach because they do not want to hinder technology and put regulatory compliance in place putting America behind in the blockchain boom.  Securities do not have utilities, commodities do
74 2018-11-18 16:57:17 Thank you! So for your gdp forecast here you are using future estimates for ISM/PMI, housing, commodities, am I right? Is it a linear model (do you use linear regression to fit variables peharps?)
75 2018-11-18 16:32:41 They are based on surveys (such as ISM/PMIs), housing market developments and certain other developments in markets such as prices changes of commodities
76 2018-11-18 16:30:36 Venezuela still produces commodities for Surplus-Value, like their Oil. If it was Socialist their Economy would have to be Use-Value driven, but it isn't.
77 2018-11-18 16:19:35 Exatamente. Na realidade os " médicos" são commodities que a ilha exporta. Mas com uma espécie de tornozeleira eletrônica; a família serve como garantia. O trabalhador vai, mas é permanentemente chantageado a não desertar e assim garantir os valores repassados ao regime.
78 2018-11-18 16:16:43 Para preservar el capital, las carteras deben migrar a treasuries, utilities, consumer staples. Salir de Commodities, high yield, tecnologicas, alto crecimiento.....
79 2018-11-18 16:14:20 É. Quando não se tem argumentos e conhecimento, as pessoas não capacitadas xigam. Não vou te responder mais. Você não sabe manter conversa civilizada. Commodities essas que precisamos importar para suprir o nosso próprio mercado interno.
80 2018-11-18 16:12:45 Would you like to win now or hope they all pan out and win in 2-8 years? I think we've kept enough in Sanchez, Judge, Sevy, Andujar, and Gleyber. I would like to hold on to Flores and Clint, maybe ever Sheff. Can afford to part with a few for proven commodities. @JoezMcfLy
81 2018-11-18 16:09:04 Funcionário publico paga imposto, você sabia? Acho que não. Desculpa mas não acredito no seu conhecimento. Tem muitas lacunas.  E tivemos muitas importações de commodities. Por que nosso mercado interno não supre nossas necessidades.
82 2018-11-18 16:08:12 não fofo isso já passou
a partir de 2002 a economia mundial foi impulsionada pela demanda de commodities da china o que foi bom pro brasil e crescemos no governo lula só que ele não modernizou e desindustrializou a economia e com a redução dessa demanda a gente tomou no cu
83 2018-11-18 16:02:31 Eu é que acho estranho vc não compreender o mercado de exportação. Enquanto uns exportam commodities, outros exportam serviços. Vc é apoiador de um partido que conhece muito bem essa lógica. Se vc não é adepto dela, está apoiando o partido errado!
84 2018-11-18 16:01:18 Vai digitar nos seus commodities. Ok?!
85 2018-11-18 15:50:10 So you watched it? I did too. Seems to me these types of moves happen kinda regularly with commodities. Short natgas in nov? Sheesh. @TheDailyHammer just made 180 some % with Ugaz in like a week, cuz he’s the man
86 2018-11-18 15:48:02 Sunshine-Fetishism:  perception of the climate relationships involved in weather, not as relationships among people and nature, but as economic relationships among the money and commodities exchanged in apparel trade?
87 2018-11-18 15:47:00 Don't forget to make a reflection of how prices of basic commodities including fuel have increased in SA. We have our fair share of problems in Zim but it's incorrect to potray Zim as if it is facing something that has never happened elsewhere in the world.
88 2018-11-18 15:42:29 Realmente nossas commodities conseguem bater de frente com toda tecnologia vendida pelo mercado. Palmas para a sua inteligência. Que só quer viver em um País que só tem commodities para vender. E nunca fui contra as reformas.
89 2018-11-18 15:41:38 Many common people of India didn't here about sitaram kesri, they are not intersted also to know about kesri or Nehru. People want to know why the promises made in 2014 is not fulfilled. Why the prices of essential commodities is rising, why no jobs, no security for women.
90 2018-11-18 15:36:57 Reversión a la media? No me convence. Una cosa es el típico negocio que pasa por un bache y luego recupera beneficios y expansión de múltiplos.

Con las mineras apuestan a alzas en Commodities, nuevos proyectos...
91 2018-11-18 15:35:57 Hearing scary stories of #GajaCyclone devastation from my friends and family. They need our help! #SaveDelta. It's sad that TRP hungry media's don't even report news properly. And the idiots, who sell basic commodities in higher price at this situation, you guys will rot in hell.
92 2018-11-18 15:28:03 Já falei. O que tem acabar são os privilégios do alto escalão do funcionalismo público. E volto a falar de novo, Brasil não gera riqueza, gera trabalho. Nós temos empresas como uma Apple, uma Microsoft? Não. Vendemos commodities. Ultrapassados.
93 2018-11-18 15:24:16 El trading no es solo una habilidad que te permite aplicar al mercado de forex sino tambien al de las acciones, indices, commodities
94 2018-11-18 15:17:42 Sometimes when the financial news comes on Johnny says “Huh cat? You like West Texas Intermediate?” Johnny is being silly because furry murderers don’t give you enough of a future to think about the commodities market.
95 2018-11-18 15:16:31 I learned that agro commodities imports and exports from one East African country to the other is tax free! If this is real, it's really commendable! 

#Africa #EastAfrica
96 2018-11-18 15:06:26 Buena columna de @brucemacmaster en el Tiempo de hoy sobre la Ley de Financiamiento. Hay que trabajar por un objetivo común. Urge pensar en cómo construir una economía sostenible e independiente de los commodities si pretendemos ser considerados como un país con potencial.
97 2018-11-18 14:54:59 I agree with everybody. Also laid off in 2016 after 20 years. Wages are minimum salaries, no benefits. We employees are treated like commodities. Not the way I thought I would be working just before retirement. SS will be going down  after so many years. @TeamPelosi @TomPerez
98 2018-11-18 14:53:37 Ooooh boy. A. It’s our hair and it’s important that we like it.  2) It matters not how we appear to many men, for they will treat us like commodities, even chattel if it makes the man feel more powerful. d. This isn’t about the hair, genius.
99 2018-11-18 14:45:38 Everyone wants a nation that works.
Everyone wants 2 invest & make gains not when u invest, u won’t see any profit, ur capital won’t even be complete.
Commodities re going higher everyday.
Buy a painter of carry today, go 2 d market 2 days later & u will that prices have gone up.
100 2018-11-18 14:42:19 Lithium. Commodities over time converge with their marginal costs.
101 2018-11-18 14:41:45 This is the real issue imho.  We treat grains and oilseeds like commodities yet increasingly, this is not the case.
102 2018-11-18 14:34:20 Technology continous improvement is important but have not these become too expensive? US has policies for ocean freight as per commodities price high cost, higher freights, lower costs low freight but not same approach for Apple as per countries buying capacities? #GalaxyA9.
103 2018-11-18 14:23:26 It's all simple and easily done .

104 2018-11-18 14:23:24 Plumbers, day labourers, painters, and childcare employees all sell themselves to capitalists. As such many do not establish their wages nor do they have much decision in how wages are distributed. Workers often do not set the prices of the commodities they manufacture and sell.
105 2018-11-18 14:21:10 Religon is a type of market 
Competition for members leads churches marketing their religion to consumers.
Religious groups produce "commodities" (symbols, rituals)  to meet the "demands" of consumers.

106 2018-11-18 14:07:25 The finest commodities get haggled over the most in the Mart. The most beautiful car on the lot get priced and test driven.  So bear with the people stressing u
107 2018-11-18 13:55:05 The PeeTee and the Gang tem autoridade para falar de aparelhamento da máquina pública, corrupção e populismo.
O resto foi surfar na onda dos preços altos das Commodities.
Só isso.
#PeeTeeNeverAgain
108 2018-11-18 13:43:38 And that does a good job of explining why @BilisOnyxia doesn't like the bourse format and why you only want it for commodities.
Hmm, we don't really have an Auction House do we...it's not personal enough or haggleable enough to be a bazaar though.
109 2018-11-18 13:43:24 Afaik, there is no single EU framework for that. In general, cryptos are viewed and taxed as commodities. I think it will stay like that until crypto becomes a significant market power.
110 2018-11-18 13:42:14 I don't think the fact they're digital commodities makes any difference,  You can always sell the cards in exactly the same way as physical cards.  You would be spending hundreds to achieve the same thing with a physical deck, and hundreds more attending tournaments.
111 2018-11-18 13:27:54 By that I meant the companies who withdraw perfectly good commodities just in case some idiot doesn't do the right thing and they may get sued!!
112 2018-11-18 13:27:37 Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth.
113 2018-11-18 13:22:40 I've little experience regarding this so I'll suggest you one best possible thing is to get charity from the dealers of commodities you need. Covers the hassle and is easy to generate in comparison to money.
114 2018-11-18 13:18:11 Technology continous improvement is important but have not these become too expensive? US has policies for ocean freight as per commodities price i.e. high cost, higher freights, lower costs low freight but not same approach for Apple as per countries buying capacities? #GalaxyA9
115 2018-11-18 13:07:14 The commodities and minerals that we value add will be levied at a rate to the SWF. The irony is that the multilateral funders get our raw products, process them, create a lending portfolio back to Africa at a cost.
116 2018-11-18 12:54:41 Celebrities = disposable commodities. Don't consume.
117 2018-11-18 12:47:45 Wise then if you're diversifying it into property, assets, cash (all home & abroad), physical commodities (both brokered and actually held). Even then though, only a certain amount necessary :)

119 2018-11-18 12:42:49 As if we're able to save cows from having Garbage, control there population as per the animal welfare programs. They're used like commodities by Hindus mostly. If I'm allowed to contest for Kerala & as a CM, shall allow use of there dead bodies for carnivores.
120 2018-11-18 12:41:51 China desrespeita os direitos humanos tanto quanto Cuba! Inclusive para a geração da riqueza que ela tem hoje. Vamos parar de consumir produtos chineses por isso? Se for para ser a ferro e fogo, eu topo. Mas aí a China não vai comprar minhas commodities. Melhor esquecer então...
121 2018-11-18 12:38:34 I am an "American People" and I care. Time to abandon blood oil and seriously develop alternative energy that does not rape and destroy our planet. And also develop alternative trade commodities to weapons of war and slaughter. Economies based on oil and war machines = Hell.
122 2018-11-18 12:25:33 What has improved since than maybe price of basic commodities, maybe exchange rates maybe health delivery system tell me what is there that we can possibly regret
123 2018-11-18 12:18:21 i wish that were true. this is commodities trading, nothing more
124 2018-11-18 12:14:03 China. Cyanide spray of a campus on a portion of mineral bubbles of commodities, things we understood it blossomd (prematurely)
125 2018-11-18 12:06:54 The incumbent govt has pledged to escalate the prices of the while commodities. Also they have manifesto to wipe out the destitute from the society by adopting silly tactics. But this hike in price is wholly unacceptable, as the same is clamoring the poor to regret their poverty.
126 2018-11-18 11:36:33 Para salir de esa crisis gobierno Caamaño, Duhalde y hasta los primeros años de Nestor aplicaron un Keynesianismo que tuvo la suerte de venir acompañado con la época de la suba de commodities que nos trajo a la mal llamada década ganada, pero fue la década en que la argentina 5/5
127 2018-11-18 11:29:30 People, don't be surprised that most of these scandals about cereals and commodities that leak in the press aren't unintentional..... Traders are trying to create shortages and make money. Mercury? Ncpb? Aflatoxin?
128 2018-11-18 11:25:50 Naturally and expectedly. No surprise about that back then.
Pre 71 oil prices and commodities prices had very little fluctuation, oil producers had 4% reserve always available to throw to market would there be disruptions, investment/profits/planning were predictable.. Post Nixon
129 2018-11-18 11:16:33 Theirs also no government entity yet in America to stop you running your own company for commodities.
130 2018-11-18 10:56:48 Govt to stop all financial help, thanthri salary (if any) and all administrative help to this temple. Let ayyappa starve without nevediyam. Rice, other commodities should be stopped. Gas connection, electricity, water to Pandalam family to be disconnected

132 2018-11-18 10:48:04 @MiningirMedia The public, and often political perception,of the mining industry. The underlying policies (especially in the EU) don't promote the sector. The technological demand for key commodities keeps increasing and changing and nowadays the supply relies on a few countries
133 2018-11-18 10:37:26 Are they commodities to be afforded and bought? Nah guys, this ain't it
134 2018-11-18 10:35:23 In EU, cryptos are viewed as commodities, afaik. And it is not a tru e or false kind of thing. Different trades might have different statuses.
135 2018-11-18 10:35:23 This is either agency or zero hour contracts. Privatisation of the workforce, people treated as commodities, left to dangle. Disgrace, affects people’s well being and worth not to mention rent, bills etc and this is pre Brexit Britain.
136 2018-11-18 10:31:29 If BTC is a security for example, it is a security of what? Utility of XRP comes from xRapid, where it is used as an intermediary. The rest is mostly speculation. What is the difference from commodities? Silver/Gold has some partial utility as well.
137 2018-11-18 10:30:08 What are the commodities in human markets these days?
betrayal
cheating
Fraud
Lack of ethics
Lack of mercy
Ignorance
Moral escape
138 2018-11-18 10:22:14 Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth
139 2018-11-18 10:04:15 Next level of hunger, high cost of commodities, Never again!
140 2018-11-18 09:57:23 question is WHAT DOES SA have to offer the world in the 21st century besides commodities
141 2018-11-18 09:56:49 Empower yourself by being stronger than the capitalist urge to consume addictive commodities.
142 2018-11-18 09:50:35 true that but civil society by people like you me and Mr schussler needs to lobby for shift from commodities to manufacturing  and support of local entreupreneurs like Sowetogold beer, SASOL OIL, Morefire drink, slim socks sbu to name a few
143 2018-11-18 09:45:53 malls are a sighns of a consumer driven economy , nowonder theres domestic debt in many emerging economies, SA needs to shift to manufacturing and increasing exports to the world commodities are depressed one cannot rely on them to resolve unemployment,
144 2018-11-18 09:12:05 I've written on this before - as far as I can make out Bitcoin futures would exist in a contango market, as gold usually does. Most commodities natural state are thought one of backwardation - but I could be wrong on this, as they're an arcane area.
145 2018-11-18 08:22:20 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
146 2018-11-18 08:21:09 How many more dogs are languishing in shitholes like this. A damn outrage that this is happening in the UK in the 21c.These dogs are nothing but commodities to these sick people.Thank god these ones are out before another winter sets in. No second chances GBGB. BAN HIM! FOR LIFE!

$USD outlook:
2019 Global #GDP growth down; #Ger & #Jap maybe 2018 H2 Recession despite negative #2Yr Bonds. If #US isn't raising in 2019, what will others be doing? My guess - messing their pants!
149 2018-11-18 08:00:21 To be honest,  they have lived up to expectations Mr peller. We have high unemployment rate, high insecurity, increasing rise of food commodities,  use of State security against Nigerians. Rising debt profile, poor standard of our Education and above all Corruption.
150 2018-11-18 07:49:25 I’d have said the market is operating perfectly, 2$/meg flood year 16/17 $400+ drought year 18/19, the pattern of consumptive use is what is having the biggest impact at present. Those who grow higher value commodities can pay more for it
151 2018-11-18 07:40:58 @combust I had to look it up. "EX-CISE noun; a tax levied on certain goods and commodities produced or sold within a country and on licenses granted for certain activities."
152 2018-11-18 07:29:31 So why were all those bailouts given to states??? Or is the 'traderMoni' not an injection into the economy??? It is meant to stimulate the micro scale enterprise & balance the deficit the trader incurs by the high cost of commodities.
153 2018-11-18 07:27:53 it wouldnt be cost  effective to do a gas refill outside zim if the value matches the currency now would it? 
All these imported commodities are quoted 3-4 times their value , because retailers are not alowed to tag their price at their actual RTGS transfer value .
154 2018-11-18 07:22:52 It's not even game night at our place if there isn't wine/whiskey and snacks.

Games are ultimately replaceable commodities - the most valuable thing is having a good time.
155 2018-11-18 07:07:41 yeah like ... i def understand how people feel, i understand it completely, but truly ... companies turning our identities into commodities is perhaps *not* the wokest™ thing and we should perhaps get our priorities in order and gain a better sense of perspective
156 2018-11-18 06:57:48 True. It's great that he blamed the losses on a "rogue wave" and not on his stupid strategy of selling naked calls on commodities.
157 2018-11-18 06:45:01 Move on, understand what happened in the past but do not have an emotional attachment to it.

Basic commodities are beyond the reach of many households .  
GoZ is not doing enough to protect
160 2018-11-18 06:26:22 Sorry to hear about that.Worldwide growth slowdown,will happen to other commodities as well,be very careful !
161 2018-11-18 06:20:21 Now it’s the hospital am sure it will lead to some gas story, these are safety critical commodities you can’t just use carelessly, thus why you get issued with a certificate of compliance when using gas, but we think all these wer not thought carefully thus we y we HSE & not used
162 2018-11-18 06:13:37 I think we are addressing the wrong symptom here, firstly no one is allowed to transport gas without a permit, we gonna learn th hard way, these commodities hv special treatment of carrying and th car must b marked, but all this we taking it light. The science behind we will talk
163 2018-11-18 06:11:30 The way to make a small fortune in the commodities market is to start
with a large fortune.
164 2018-11-18 05:43:26 Another Wall Street pump and dump. And they want to let these a-holes take over public education through #charterschools? Our kids aren’t commodities for Wall Street to consume. They don’t even see the “little people“ as humans, now. They treat their own workers like livestock.
165 2018-11-18 04:56:49 Abolish drugs from your life and you will feel less dependent on capitalist commodities.
166 2018-11-18 04:18:29 He is a businessman. He has dealt with the dynasty in the past. He was into commodities exports to USSR where he made his fortune. His orders were routed through the family. His father has been close to RSS. He has also got contracts from Gadkari under Nirmal Ganga project.
167 2018-11-18 04:14:03 Silver is only ONE of many valuable commodities. At some point, people will prefer something else.
168 2018-11-18 04:08:52 "Maize meal, flour, rice and salt are basic food commodities. Any price increase on the account of packaging costs will be unfortunate and makes these products unaffordable to millions of consumers,” - GMAZ     @grain_millers spokesperson, @ChaunzaGarikai
169 2018-11-18 04:07:52 El gobierno K tuvo el precio de los commodities por las nubes, es obvio que va a poder pagar el estado que tuvo porque la guita estaba, en vez de ahorrar hicieron despilfarro y los pelotudos de ahora no hacen el ajuste que hay que hacer en el sector público
170 2018-11-18 04:06:14 BTW, I would be happy to separate you from gold or silver, they are both valuable commodities you can trade for stuff. But they are not money.
171 2018-11-18 04:03:38 All we get tht buy stealin our money (two cents), lyin bout mega deals , inflation fuel shortages price hikes shortage of basic commodities
172 2018-11-18 04:03:02 No reason to do anything other than negative QE.  30 yr tbond has fallen to 3.19% in the last 4 years, if there was any inflation in the immediste future the 30 yr would be at 4% +.  Industrial commodities   and oil are telling us that inflation is not the problem.   #Markets

177 2018-11-18 02:51:33 Working in oil could mean you're a oil commodities trader and/or an engineer. Which takes learning not much labor. And you're a Trumpanzee besides that, which means you have no empathy for others because they're not like you or Trump. Plus how do we know you're not lying?!

183 2018-11-18 02:32:08 Index Futures price movement is based on Open Interest and not supply and demand . Commodities futures prices - based on Supply and demand . Natural gas price movement screwed lot of hedge funds in the last 7 days .

186 2018-11-18 01:52:22 No really, that's what Alan Greenspan once told the Commodities regulator, that "the market" would take care of fraud.
So hey cheer up moron, we've got just the libertarian idiots in charge now to test that theory.
187 2018-11-18 01:51:22 Given women’s sexual strategy, & their innate hypergamy, it is necessary for men to view interactions with women as a potential exchange of commodities.

By doing so, you naturally default to the preferred setting of making yourself “your mental point of origin”.

189 2018-11-18 01:45:28 Things that keep me up at night: That the next big Asian rep movie out of Hollywood will just be Ready Player One but instead of 80s pop culture references, all the cameo characters are just food items, commodities, brands, and the worst 9gag memes imaginable.
190 2018-11-18 01:42:28 Having said that, their histories, they’re known commodities, they’ve earned that

192 2018-11-18 01:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
193 2018-11-18 00:46:26 Not really. You’ve had a run in football but, we’ve had you covered in the Show Down Series 3 years in a row. While your grads continue to over produce commodities we’re bringing biomedical research jobs to the state. Be grateful you can do a couple things well.
194 2018-11-18 00:28:04 People like Boris Johnson and his ilk, only see Mother Earth and all that live   on it as  commodities to be bought, sold, and used for their benefit, now people are not only questioning that assumption but protesting about it, the days of exploitation are coming to an end..
195 2018-11-18 00:25:56 We did, bc we could print USD for imports and Russia couldn’t.  This is why CNY oil/commodities is a potential gamechanger.  Quorum of US industrial base never resided in USSR but does in China, & Russia could never print RUB for global commodities.

197 2018-11-18 00:15:09 No. Resources ARE commodities.
198 2018-11-17 23:57:07 I don’t think it is, I think it will remain a behind the scenes coin and some kind of digital fiat will be introduced that will be manipulated and XRP will help with the liquidity crisis by being the vehicle to transport all new digital finance, commodities, currencies, etc.
199 2018-11-17 23:47:00 3. CBI and RBI are part one team. Difference happens any big team and that shows both have some opinions. No one is acting like Robot PM which we had earlier. 4. Check inflation and prices of all the commodities in 2013 and 2018. Then, ask yourself which was acche din..
200 2018-11-17 23:42:10 Possibly. Can’t speak in terms of the economic implications. But price behavior in both stocks and commodities is pointing to much lower rates imo. Which is why we’ve been long bonds in November
201 2018-11-17 23:27:10 Like I said when you’re on a stacked team with a lot of commodities, it’s easy to move starts and get stars. But what about the people trying to improve their rosters, we have to trade out only stars away to get anyone.

Solo exportación de commodities nos dejan vulnerables.Cúal es la apuesta en tecnología? O en turismo que nos dan mayor rentabilidad? No hay #innovación y #diversificación de la economía
235 2018-11-17 21:27:16 Prices on these commodities should go down for domestic consumers. Those agricultural Trump supporters get no sympathy from me. They reap the famine they sow.
236 2018-11-17 21:23:34 Yes, because we're not talking about equities, commodities typically trade within ranges. So although NG was trending up, traders like to sell  OTM Calls at the upper range for a move to reversion to mean. Obviously that was not the case here, and VOL + Price exploded.
237 2018-11-17 21:20:41 Astrology is ITSELF a commodity—a service—it is sold as part of mass media, it is used in marketing, and people pay for readings, books, lessons, etc. Are news, entertainment, books, lessons, advertisements & readings not commodities? (3/-)
238 2018-11-17 21:17:37 If commodity fetishism and/or false consciousness consists in the reification of actually existing social relationships by investing in commodities or atavistic spiritual beliefs, so as to see them as having a life of their own, and their own causal force, then (1/-)
239 2018-11-17 21:01:45 need somebody that's good with stocks and commodities to finesse this project for me. it's actually fairly easy
240 2018-11-17 20:50:48 I command this otherwise unruly cabal, using a combination of intimidation and violence, on an indefinite campaign to steal valuable commodities - killing anyone who gets in their way. So, in a sense I am Democratic.
241 2018-11-17 20:39:00 Oyster Alerts automatically checks your Oyster account for incomplete journeys and maximum fares so you don't have to. We save you time and money, which are both precious commodities in #London
242 2018-11-17 20:37:51 Just finished up my interview with Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities magazine.  They always do a great job!
243 2018-11-17 20:36:07 Not my area of expertise but off the top of my head from some brief accounting cost years ago, i think for certain commodities you get to book revenue at time of production bc you know what it's going to sell for. Seems like similar treatment here and prob makes sense
244 2018-11-17 20:18:43 Boycott the high street Boxing Day sales this year, they only rip service staff away from their families to serve the perverse fetishism of commodities and fill the pockets of the retailers.
245 2018-11-17 20:15:29 For row crops, some is that they are commodities, but most is bc I think better way to think is not $/unit of output but $/acre.
246 2018-11-17 20:12:50 On the real costs of inputs declining just as fast, would that loss of their value be due to the fact that they themselves as commodities are subject to the same efficiency swap, of which itself too will eventually run out room for improvement... like the rate flatlining
247 2018-11-17 20:07:02 Cordier's strategy was to sell only commodities. Claim was that these were uncorrelated with stock market.
248 2018-11-17 20:04:32 And i completely agree commodities are to cheap but both cattle and grain have been at nearly double current prices and it let to huge overproduction.
249 2018-11-17 20:02:39 Claro que só tem a perder. País é dependente da exportação de commodities. E a maior parte quem compra é a China. Aí um animal imbecil que venceu as eleições desfaz da China. Só sendo muito burro. Este racista vai estraçalhar o país, visto os inúteis que estarão ao seu lado.
250 2018-11-17 19:56:03 It's replaced by a farm bill.  Last time the farm bill lapsed it made the news a little.  Government would support commodities up to early 1900s inflation values.
251 2018-11-17 19:53:53 Economic Socialism bankrupted that country. The govt was subsidizing every item from fuel to drugs and essential commodities refused to understand the changes in the economic climate occasioned by drop in oil prices. So they sunk.
252 2018-11-17 19:52:02 tied to capitalism & commodities yeah
253 2018-11-17 19:42:34 This is not all that relevant if a statistic. Oil is traded on an international commodities exchange. The oil produced here does not necessarily stay here. Even refined components can and are shipped overseas.
254 2018-11-17 19:35:20 on a different not what commodities are you into??
255 2018-11-17 19:13:28 Till now not a singly penny benefit rendered to Poor/downtrodden and Vulnerable Peoples of Pakistan by PTI govt. in their practical life.On the Contrary their lives becomes more miserable due to price hike of every essential commodities, increase cost of Gas, Electricity and Fuel
256 2018-11-17 19:08:20 We're conditioned by capitalism to consume commodities and not experience anything. It's all about the signifier and the signified. The raw material is lost in a sea of commerce.  #capitalism

257 2018-11-17 18:40:00 But this happens already, sow stalls, neonics, GM products. I can guarantee 100% that no UK farmer has cut down any rainforest to produce commodities that end up as food or biofuel.
258 2018-11-17 18:33:53 J.Cordier specialized in selling  OTM options on commodities futures which tends to have juicy premiums but tougher to risk manage. Similar to insurance companies, his investors are more than likely to have collect steady returns for awhile to offset some of this devasting loss.
259 2018-11-17 18:32:12 Bringing commodities to a relationship is always better than 50/50 , what you bring to the table, etc 
#InnerBeautyMovement
260 2018-11-17 18:28:48 Only in Nigeria could a President achieve the highest ever recorded unemployment rate, have poverty skyrocket over 100%, see wages go down with essential commodities going up.
And ungodly looting taking place without persecution and impunity.
And STILL be allowed to contest again
261 2018-11-17 18:24:00 That was horrifying to watch. I pray the guy doesn't kill himself. Many characteristics of a charlatan though. Naked options with leverage on commodities will eventually lead to ruin. The steering boat thing would have also been a warning.
262 2018-11-17 18:06:57 Eis o problema: abrir mercados para exportações é dificil para caramba, em especial de commodities agricolas, com subsídios e barreiras comerciais/sanitárias. Por isso que ter um governo de amadores que só falam asneiras não é um bom negócio.
263 2018-11-17 18:05:38 They wouldn't have if western  imperialists hadn't used them as commodities and cannon fodder  like US and Europe still do to the poorest in society today for post modern imperialism.
264 2018-11-17 17:57:37 We may be living with just the basic commodities of life, we cannot travel, we cannot treat ourselves in a fine restaurant, we cannot own a house, we cannot buy a nicer car, but i have everythinh i need that money can't buy. How about you?
265 2018-11-17 17:53:40 Good government ensures that citezen has access to basic commodities (period), ( command agric to ensure availability of staple sadza)
266 2018-11-17 17:53:26 @murraygold hi Murray. I just watch tv show #TheMusketeers from #BBC. I like your music for Season 1 but cannot buy it anywhere. Is there a way how to buy OST for Season 1? Or just only song for S01E03 Commodities - Captain Bonnaire enter scene? :) Thanks a lot :)
267 2018-11-17 17:47:07 Puro mimimi. Vão comprar commodities agrícolas de qualidade de quem então? Vão pagar mais caro, duvido!
268 2018-11-17 17:38:39 ... and contact US, Australia and Canada to ask if they will in the short term assist with drugs and other goods and commodities that no longer will be imported from EU sources.
269 2018-11-17 17:32:24 I’m not expecting the rules to apply to the UK. I do expect the EU to allow vital commodities like food and medicine to be traded to UK. We aren’t looking for the stuff for free. And if the EU are going to make it difficult for us to get those items then they we’re better off out
270 2018-11-17 17:26:36 It  is also alot more fun. If like me, you are a big NHL fan,the  idea of  making money from the sport you love is remarkably appealing.

There   is also the instantaneous nature of profit creation. Unlike investing   in shares, commodities or property, a majority of the time...

272 2018-11-17 17:21:18 women’s view on men: commodities
273 2018-11-17 16:55:11 O problema é que no Brasil os militares são nacionalistas às avessas. Eles permitem a farra dos gringos nas commodities e baixam o cacete no povo. É um braço da guarda nacional americana sendo sustentada pelos brasileiros.
274 2018-11-17 16:54:09 BOLTON is a company, rare entity, with a proven track record in older, more established markets such as real estate and commodities that is using this expertise as a launchpad for entry into the vast potentialities of the digital currency arena.  #cryptocurrency #ICO #coin #token
275 2018-11-17 16:49:18 Final point. The rail v. pipeline comparison needs to consider that the major rail interests are the way they are because of downsizing and the lust for shareholder returns. The industry has been gutted as a result. How rail manages oil and other commodities needs to change.
276 2018-11-17 16:49:13 Yep. I am your son/daughter/whathaveyou not a mortgage holder. That goes for non black children too! We are not commodities.
277 2018-11-17 16:30:23 Jonathan's administration for not saving is that not demonic. If we want to accept the narrative Buhari's agents have made you believe all these while,  what are the prices of basic commodities under allegedly corrupt ridden PDP and how much is under Saint Buhari's administration
278 2018-11-17 16:26:10 Drugs are commodities and demand is responsive to price.  As the price of cannabis plummets, there is more use, just as has been the case with tobacco, alcohol etc.
279 2018-11-17 16:22:36 Writing is the transmission of knowledge and culture. Mathematics came into existence as a means of keeping track of commodities. Combined they advance humanity. Facebook was meant to be a transmitter. Putin used it as tool promoting a falsehood. Education is the antidote.
280 2018-11-17 15:52:14 Sir Janta ka vikas ya statues banaane ke kaam.. We common people feel the heat of the financial jhumla that goes around. I appreciate many things you do but many seem senseless. Fuel prices, rising prices of basic commodities to mention a few.. can we spend the money on better
281 2018-11-17 15:43:51 Trust is still one of the best commodities in Business.
282 2018-11-17 15:36:17 Through a network of interoperable liquidity pools, both exchanges provide cross-chain and cross-asset exchange and multi-asset trading.

287 2018-11-17 15:12:13 XJP: Live a better life by buying PRC excess capacity while we steal your commodities and raw material.  Yeah, mercantilism with Chinese characteristics.
288 2018-11-17 15:09:08 Love, time, and hope are precious commodities
289 2018-11-17 15:04:08 And therein lies the problem, she says: “They [Arabs] almost conquered the whole world on their own and arab countries are some of the richest amongst the world.” She sees non Arabs as dispensable commodities to be profited from.
290 2018-11-17 14:55:09 and if he's trading commodities and/or options on commodities, he should be monitoring his position 24hrs a day, not just during daylight hours, also, his web page is not totally bank, except for business address and phone number
291 2018-11-17 14:43:53 I'm damn sure they would. By the way if Labour get back in power could you please ban shorting on anything, £, commodities etc. because it's of no value to society only of value to irresponsible greedy people who care nothing about their country.
292 2018-11-17 14:36:58 California produces over 350 commodities; 1/3 of the nation's vegetables & nearly 2/3 of the nation's fruits and nuts. produces 90% of the strawberries Between 1/3 & 1/2 of all farmworkers in America reside in California, roughly 500,000 - 800,000 farmworkers
293 2018-11-17 14:35:33 Recently diversified some more. Mostly into precious metal funds alternative energy and water (drinking water) ETF’s. The way the world is burning through resources owning limited commodities could be great. Must think outside the box and proceed with caution 
294 2018-11-17 14:34:37 If i enjoy my salary in this time of #inflation (when the commodities is high & the money become under value currency) think of #those who are not #civil_servant .
295 2018-11-17 14:31:42 Que seja verdade, esse não é o ponto. Primeiro que não é o Brasil que os está expulsando, é Cuba que quer retirá-los. Segundo que independente da habilidade deles, a questão é se é justo aceitar as condições de Cuba, que trata seus cidadãos como commodities, para tê-los aqui.
296 2018-11-17 14:18:31 Yes it’s technically 1 asset, but sold at 2 different exchanges, Old Mutual London and Old Mutual Harare. Any difference in those exchange rates implies a positive or negative arbitrage between the two commodities which Ceteris Paribus should be more or less in the same ballpark
297 2018-11-17 14:16:16 If answering the most basic questions on matter and the universe wasn't satisfying enough, those billions of dollars make new technologies commodities. Some famous examples: the world wide web, high performance computing, MRIs, etc.
298 2018-11-17 14:09:10 Rolling new consensus algos is hard and there can be cryptocurrencies, in a legal sense of being commodities, that are nonetheless shitcoins due to weak fundamentals around mining security. A coin like Verge touted aggressively and cntrlzed enough may become a (legal) security.
299 2018-11-17 14:06:36 I think you guys are giving too much credence to the tweet of a celebrity. They're not worth very much. Celebrities are commodities that can be bought and sold at the drop of a dollar
300 2018-11-17 14:05:37 a tweet from a celebrity is not worth very much. Celebrities are commodities that can be bought and sold at the drop of a dollar.
301 2018-11-17 13:39:39 One way of eliminating poverty is ensuring there are no schools fees and  essential commodities are readily available and affordable. Invest in the health care system that way billions also spent overseas will remain here . Invest 1sh and you get 2sh back .
302 2018-11-17 13:38:26 I just came to know that during coming season, there wont be any water for our agriculture lands based in Sindh. Pl do something, its going to be hard, Commodities are going to be costly
303 2018-11-17 13:34:23 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
304 2018-11-17 13:34:00 Finance Minister @arunjaitley
Each one of the steps we took resulted in formalisation.... We could bring down taxes in over 300 commodities.

#ETAwards @EconomicTimes @ETAwards
305 2018-11-17 13:27:30 France stopped quotas being sold on and their coastal communities flourish. Tories let our quotas to be sold as commodities. 

Now 50% of English quotas are held by foreign business, 25% by 1 Dutch vessel. Spanish firms own 88% of Welsh quotas.

'Sovereignty' eh Ross?

306 2018-11-17 13:21:15 Perhaps the greatest loss in our casual sex culture is how that mindset makes people into commodities to be used rather than people to know deeply.
307 2018-11-17 13:18:56 Children shouldn’t be commodities
308 2018-11-17 13:13:41 In the name of fighting corruption and promises of building heaven on earth, APC removed subsidy on petrol which consequentially caused general price increase of commodities, goods & services. Life is now difficult for Nigerians that rice has to subsidized so that people can eat.
309 2018-11-17 13:12:07 The international commodities market is very precarious, thats the stark reality. There's need for novel strategies to be pursued by producers towards obtaining the best prices for 'their' commodities via all manner of ingenuity like sub-branding (think Ethiopian coffee) etc....
310 2018-11-17 13:00:11 If you are exclusively #crypto you are missing out. If you are exclusively #equities your are missing out.  If you are exclusively #commodities you are missing out.  There is money to be made everywhere!
311 2018-11-17 12:54:16 I think gold and silver will be used in the next crisis. Then bitcoin and Litecoin will be pegged to those commodities.
312 2018-11-17 12:42:16 Come to Lagos island and see some of the relics of the commodities shop built during the regime of Buhari. How i wish a lot of my mate know the history behind those building.
313 2018-11-17 12:28:16 Companies pay for capacity by selling commodities - no business model in current gas market for holding capacity open. Cheaper to insulate houses & increase renewables than build pipelines to meet transition demands in 2020s. Modelling of this in EU countries can be found @e3g
314 2018-11-17 12:21:09 What about commodities bubbles such oil? Heavily manipulated?? 120 $ 5 years ago after 20$ barrel ? Isn’t it also a bubble?
315 2018-11-17 11:31:18 Scary. I thought the book was good and so were the videos. Don't know what did them in. One moral is: Never, never sell options with unlimited risk, especially in single commodities & single commodities.
316 2018-11-17 11:24:32 Well, this is debatable. Outside food means more littering + smelly theaters. Instead, multiplexes need to regulate prices for commodities sold inside the premises.
317 2018-11-17 11:18:38 Melhor do Bull Market é que mesmo quando nada positivo acontece, nenhuma reforma foi acertada, mercados externos não melhoraram, commodities não subiram mas o Ibovespa está 88.5, coladinho nas máximas.
318 2018-11-17 11:07:55 Indeed, politics treats the vulnerable as commodities
319 2018-11-17 11:04:08 Igor con todo respeto. la soja es un commodities tiene un valor en el mercado. un impuesto sólo afecta en la estructura de costos. igual se va a vender. sólo que va a ganar menos el productor
320 2018-11-17 10:44:18 It's a horrible sign of the times that people's creative endeavours are seen as commodities now. It's utterly awful. I can't count how many times l've explained Creative Commons in work despite the fact I'm a designer. "It's just a picture. Don't fuss about it." Rage.
321 2018-11-17 10:32:41 lots of live small animals are considered landscaping/agricultural commodities bc they eat the small animals you dont want

326 2018-11-17 09:53:14 Environmentally, socially & economically it's unsustainable. Ideally we wouldn't have borders, but that wouldn't work right now, if we had a FOM deal with Nigeria, 1000,000's would pour into the UK, great for yummy mummy's in Chelsea cheap au pairs, but people arn't commodities.
327 2018-11-17 09:34:45 Pure water, one of the most basic and essential commodities have been increased by 50%...meanwhile,they are telling u inflation is going down. Voodoo economics. #TheBigIssue
328 2018-11-17 09:24:17 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
329 2018-11-17 09:21:28 The impact of cheap Russian origin wheat (and other commodities) has been building for quite a time now. We have seen them put low grade wheat into our premium markets and show us up. We need to get a lot smarter about it, especially without the SD.
330 2018-11-17 09:16:59 Help delta people as much as you can by giving essential commodities and volunteers to come up against this disastrous event we need to help each other #centralgovt #TNGovernment #SaveDelta
331 2018-11-17 09:04:37 It's really nice when Dubai Govt Depts work with rather than just seeing you as a source of increasing revenue. And so it was with the DMCC last week. Courtesy, Logic & Service Excellence prevailed. So THANK YOU VERY MUCH to the service Team @ the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre
332 2018-11-17 09:03:28 Independent hotels are brands.  Logo Hotel Companies are commodities. I think this sums it up??
333 2018-11-17 09:02:49 No tales from the crypt! I want more jobs for my country, i want more houses for my country, I want cheaper commodities for my country! Eu citizens disappear from the U.K. and we get no deal, and we eat pink unicorns cooked in U.K. Wein!
334 2018-11-17 08:38:37 To the orphanage! And I'm trying to raise commodities for charity such as clothes and anything less valuable to you that'll go a long way for the kids without parents.
335 2018-11-17 08:27:15 May be to get the market on the track..
Since last week if we observe the prices have been falling for all the commodities, it was at peak before festivals but now correction of upto 40-50$ per mt in almost each commodities....

So it may be a false rumor from commodity market.
336 2018-11-17 08:23:44 There is a distressing amount of footage out there showing this kind of behaviour. Some people are just sick and viewing animals as commodities allows this side of them out.
337 2018-11-17 08:17:33 Hahahaha, the report of the lamp and of course the pains and poverty on the streets, the prices of rice and other commodities, those are the reports I believe.
338 2018-11-17 08:17:06 Grab em by the pussy Americans grab Slomo by the agates and whoopee another USA base in our midst of the Pacific , another great reason why China will keep sourcing our commodities. Dont know who stole our sovereignty but it wasn’t Asia. #auspol # fedIcac
339 2018-11-17 08:14:29 By the time Zimbabwe delivers quality services to it's people, then people will stop carrying gas canisters on transit. The reason that canister was on board is the shortage of gas where it was destined for.  Those commodities must be available within walkable distances.
340 2018-11-17 08:10:17 Should commuters boycott public transport?? People are travelling to Messina to buy basic commodities, a husband regretted having sent his wife to get provisions after learning that she perished in the fire leaving 4 children motherless.
341 2018-11-17 08:03:59 Hahaha! Bakit nga naman tumaas na ang lahat ng prices ng commodities pero ang prize ng Cheerdance competition 50k lang?! Good call out @neilpatrick_f
342 2018-11-17 07:28:13 I don't miss Mugabe, he was a doddering, old charlatan, but the reality is that basic commodities have become far more expensive under Mnangagwa so I understand why many people may feel Bob was better. Under the "new dispensation" people can't afford basics they used to afford
343 2018-11-17 07:22:33 This tweet alone demonstrate you know nothing about crypto. You should really talk just about commodities.
344 2018-11-17 07:16:55 I hear you, but if men partner with feminists for their own gain, are we not still commodities for them to exploit?
345 2018-11-17 07:15:11 Mi hata sijui naweza fanya nini? But if I’m to beba anything for you without you, lazima I inspect the commodities with you
346 2018-11-17 06:59:22 Midwestern states need to realize the commodities they have and charge the coasts accordingly.

For example, other states should be charging a high premium to provide California with water. Same with foods, wheat etc. This would prop up more rural states and increase equality.
347 2018-11-17 06:52:44 Once again, his whole demeanor changed ;the deafening sound of miscellaneous commodities slumping abruptly, ruthlessly onto the stone floor.

❛ Can't you see I'm busy!     The next time you decide to intrude on my / Happy Place / I'll show you just how mean I can be. . ❜
348 2018-11-17 06:50:13 Yes bcz price is related to commodities
349 2018-11-17 06:48:57 Money lost honorably.

In Rs 12000 crore #NSEL fraud, 13000 families were looted, where contract notes were issued against 0 commodities in #Nsel warehouse.

Acche din for fraudster in India!
350 2018-11-17 05:41:11 Cool story. Curious, though, if votes are consider to be fungible like certain commodities; in order all votes are identical, so it's impossible to tell which voter cast the deciding vote?
351 2018-11-17 05:26:09 See, you run and hide from the question because you know state run enterprises rarely produce any commodities at all.  It can only work where everyone OBEYS and works like a good slave, why it's called the YOKE of socialism = no Liberty.

353 2018-11-17 04:44:05 one needs to see why sugar and other commodities behave in 1960s and 1970s to get a glimpse of this the hints are all there .
354 2018-11-17 04:41:03 What you are describing is a free market. Oil is bought and sold like many other commodities (like gold etc.) on global prices. If you are right then it should be easy for you to find the section in the old NAFTA agreement that details this.
355 2018-11-17 04:40:44 Mi inquietud con los commodities es si pueden bajar los precios por debajo de los costos de producción?
356 2018-11-17 04:40:00 First ask yourself: What is the worst that can happen? Then prepare to accept it. Then proceed to improve on the worst.

357 2018-11-17 04:35:19 Much of global trade is conducted in dollars but this masks the underlying players. The producers of global commodities (excluding oil) and products priced in USD don’t care about oil. Oil is not an asset that generates returns on assets except though storage and speculation 2/

359 2018-11-17 04:25:06 Because pro-life advocates believe that sex exists in nature to not only forge intimacy but to also procreate. Sex does not inherently brings couples closers, today’s culture of sex and pornography as commodities has devalued the way people so others and themselves.
360 2018-11-17 04:22:24 Why you assume that I think women are baby making machines is beyond me? Why not comment on the toxic sex positive culture that dehumanized and objectifies men + women as commodities for pleasure causing unintended pregnancies?
361 2018-11-17 04:09:35 I found bags of WFP flour being sold in a shop in Ras Imran on the outskirts of Aden recently, an area where a lot of IDPs have settled. While IDPs sometimes sell aid commodities for more important things (ie medicine) a lot of aid gets ‘lost’ on its way to those most in need :(

364 2018-11-17 03:44:02 The only draw I can relate to is profit, the xrp crowd are driven by unrealistic greed. I think xrp will be around for a long time because it is bank based and therefore a sure bet in the long run. It takes intelligence and balls to go against herd mind, rare commodities indeed.
365 2018-11-17 03:39:01 true. dumping and manipulation happens in all markets. Crypto manipulation is noobish. If you look at commodities, thats real professional manipulation. Learn to take advantage of it

379 2018-11-17 01:24:19 False equivalency first: there is nothing to gain by helping NK, the US has a huge wealth of natural resources. By funding insurgency, like the French did when we founded this country, allies could secure futures and commodities.

I See no reason why a meager amount of #30, 000 should be an issue. It should be agreed upon. The government should also make sure that prices of commodities don't go up, otherwise the increment will be rendered useless.
384 2018-11-17 00:27:29 It’s actually not. That’s a misconception. It’s a bad way to try and determine a commodity’s potential growth, but it’s an extremely logical way to value it in comparison to other commodities.
385 2018-11-17 00:26:34 Market capitalization doesn’t apply to commodities. It’s a bad metric to use for #XRP.

432 2018-11-16 21:11:27 That’s not inflation. Inflation is a specific monetary phenomenon. The discovery of oil increased the supply of commodities in the world but it has nothing to do with inflation. I’m beginning to think you haven’t read any Austrian economic books.

470 2018-11-16 18:35:10 A globalização mundial não deu certo. O euro não emplacou e o dólar continua no comando. Dava mais certo quando, sobretudo os alimentos não eram commodities, tudo funcionava na base da troca: Te mando 500 sacas de café e você me manda 800 sacas de trigo. Simples assim.

473 2018-11-16 18:06:54 “Why do the products of labor take the form of commodities with prices?” and “What sort of social relations between producers are necessary in order for this to happen?”

479 2018-11-16 17:43:43 @ChrisCuomo the reason drugs and “illegals” inundate our borders, is the insatiable demand that we have in US for both of these commodities.   We numb ourselves, and fear having to bend over and pick strawberries all day.

489 2018-11-16 16:55:13 That's the thing, isn't it.  Women and children were still mainly seen as commodities back then, so things like respect and common decency didn't apply.
490 2018-11-16 16:53:58 It’s weird that the victims of ponzi schemes are exploited by abstract concepts of future moneys, but precious metal mongers typically are trying to invest in very concrete, safe commodities. It’s like scamming an anti-vaxxer into using captain America enhancements.
491 2018-11-16 16:52:59 Eggs are supply managed so it doesn't matter. Other commodities like beef, pork, produce could be affected, or not. I just think the USDA  presents an interesting hypothesis, something we should look into in Canada.

532 2018-11-16 14:41:07 Yes; this also shows why CNY oil could be big.  CNY bear case = China's current acct near a deficit & rising commodities will cause CNY BoP crisis; falling oil alleviates pressure, & China's non-comm goods surplus = $700B.  If China can print CNY for comms, CNY bear case is wrong

570 2018-11-16 11:57:18 O Brasil é grande exportador de commodities, mas é só na pauta ambiental que o país exerce papel de liderança na diplomacia internacional. Agora, com a nova ideologia que orientará o Itamaraty, a tendência é perder esse lugar e ser apenas mais um no cenário global.

573 2018-11-16 11:27:53 I am predicting that bitcoin will fall below 3000 before going up and we might be an year away from bitcoin to start rising.I don't trust these charts. Logic is as currencies move away from dollar...dollar will rise and so commodities will fall, till black market takes over.
574 2018-11-16 11:23:20 sorry to ask but what do they do to support the farms and farmers who are into production of these agro commodities, why should they control, regulate or even fix the prices of any agro produce or commodities ?
575 2018-11-16 11:22:05 Seems the whistle blowers are slowly being shut ..like now,no one is on wanjiku's side now .prices of commodities will hike anytime now so we are left alone to bear the burden of being born kenyans

578 2018-11-16 11:12:10 Did any government under PDP slid our economy into recession 
Which of her government recorded 150% increase in the prices of commodities 
It's only recession that can cause such a hike
579 2018-11-16 11:06:35 What brought about the hike in price was recession.  Which of the government recorded an increase of 150% increase in the prices of commodities.. Is only recession that can cause that

592 2018-11-16 09:23:15 Shilling loses value, leading to higher cost of basic commodities. So whatever extra gain in income is cancelled out by inflation.

602 2018-11-16 08:29:37 In my opinion, we should not discuss "storage" or "computers" on IT. These are indeed commodities that you can get cheaply on a cloud provider for example. Instead, we should discuss how IT can truly become an org enabler that helps the entire business to better deliver.
603 2018-11-16 08:25:00 The way you folks are talking about food, I'm just wondering to myself that government probably should have established the Commodity Exchange outside #Accra like somewhere in central #Ghana. Commodities trading actually happens in places outside Accra. @benkoku #CitiCBS

648 2018-11-16 03:39:26 Crypto assets are currencies, commodities and/or tokens. 

BTC is a commodity currency according to the CFTC but more importantly it's the evolution of accounting; triple entry accounting or encrypted double entry accounting on a decentralized ledger.

BTC is not yet money.

671 2018-11-16 01:22:26 How long has RBOB gasoline or "light sweet crude" been static? It's been roughly the same for a long time. Same for "gold" and much more. Commodities are fungible AND stable in their features. People need to understand this key difference whether pro or not for EV's.
