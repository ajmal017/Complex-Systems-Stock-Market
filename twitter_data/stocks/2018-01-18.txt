8 2018-01-18 23:52:09 I agree with you, but those comments towards Sosa were a little bit harsh, anyways I still think MLB knew and took advantage of this players during the steroids era to improve numbers, stocks share, etc, it wasn't until this past season where two guys hit 50+ hr.

46 2018-01-18 23:41:15 Interesting  Let me look into some stocks then .
47 2018-01-18 23:41:14 To be honest you could put about a dozen blockchain/crypto stocks on there and they will all match up.  Sx and idk have been the worst but it’s not just them. My portfolio will confirm this
48 2018-01-18 23:40:07 Aussie shares off to a slightly better start. #ASX 200 +0.1% or +4pts to 6018. Mining stocks, industrials, telcos, banks under pressure. Healthcare firmer #ausbiz
49 2018-01-18 23:38:42 #Cramer #CNBC is talking about #CognitiveDissonance as a reason to be bullish on stocks. #LeonFestinger must be rolling over in his grave. IMO the issue is not to be #bullish or #bearish - Rather it is to be a smart buyer not caught up in the mania. #DontChaseParabolicStocks

51 2018-01-18 23:36:05 Is it to soon to talk about Sandy Hook massacre or the Las Vegas shooting yet @GOP @NRA ? How do bump stocks help hunters unless they are home grown terrorists hunting for human beings?

55 2018-01-18 23:31:59 That’s how stocks work. Your best bet is to just take your money out while you have it. It’s a gamble.
56 2018-01-18 23:30:57 Jack + @MarcRijnbeek, ETFs are funds that are traded on stock exchanges, so it's just like buying a stock (use a broker like Ameritrade or Merrill)

These funds are managed, so they hold/trade like 100 different companies. Tends to lower the variance vs. individual stocks
57 2018-01-18 23:30:53 Love that I made a nice dinner for my mom and she takes this chance to show me how great the stocks are because of Trump. 
58 2018-01-18 23:30:48 I agree but the rally is US stocks actually makes bitcoin look childish lol can't pick a top, got to wait for a key decision price for a trade.
59 2018-01-18 23:29:14 Trump admit that his stocks made his 42% in 2017. He still an active investor. That is illegal! Trump and the GOP are corrupt to the core.
60 2018-01-18 23:27:47 $80b on buybacks during the tech revolution.... ugh.

65 2018-01-18 23:26:04 Pitchfork and Torch stocks sound like a good investment.

69 2018-01-18 23:24:16 Barely 1/3 of families in the bottom 50% of earners own stocks. Nearly 94% of the top income group owned stocks in 2016. In all, just 54% of Americans invest in the market, either through stocks, mutual funds, pensions or retirement plans like a 401(k). Just thought I’d help...
70 2018-01-18 23:24:07 But I will admit this I'm making money in the market on undervalued stocks with the increases. Don't buy GE though lol

75 2018-01-18 23:21:29 @jimcramer Hey do you think it's a good idea for a teen to start investing  in stocks and if so any where could i turn to learn more about investing. Because when ever I go online trying to learn more I end up getting more confused then I was before I started.
76 2018-01-18 23:20:22 Just waiting on the bitconnect reco next . It’s the same thing with stocks. The time they say it, it’s already too late.
77 2018-01-18 23:19:11 I buy stocks go up, sell stocks that go down.
78 2018-01-18 23:17:57 @tedlieu don't waste your time,  he knows. He set this up @ a  shutdown dems are blamed, GOP is confused & he sweeps in to fix what he broke they look stupid & he looks like a great fixer. Then the stocks will go up again he will get credit & bragging rights!

87 2018-01-18 23:10:53 #bbcqt I bought some stocks in infrastructure and concrete probably a bad investment.

89 2018-01-18 23:09:40 Where has Chris Grayling got stocks & shares?
90 2018-01-18 23:08:47 I'm saying Volatility because U stocks went down on Tuesday, were up on Wednesday, then down today... which provides swing traders with the volatility they need in order to successfully complete a very short term trade.  No volatility = no success.  Cheers!
91 2018-01-18 23:07:08 Slightly(!) less than investment grade. Share price heading south since 2013. And they've been one of the most shorted stocks since 2015. It's not as if the signs weren't there.
92 2018-01-18 23:06:47 Could the bull run in stocks continue through 2019?
93 2018-01-18 23:06:35 Fuck, I bought some weak ass stocks 
94 2018-01-18 23:06:18 What is happening now is what happened right before the bottom fell out stocks grossly overpriced Wall Street deregulation again the housing market slowing for what 3 quarters now? Will you blame the con or obama for republican policy changes? /2
95 2018-01-18 23:05:53 Don't you have stocks in all of those wouldn't this post be considered like a pump n dump kinda thing which is illegal
96 2018-01-18 23:05:34 Yes i have been so upset about companies not buying enough of their stocks back to artificially inflate their share prices.  I feel so much better now.
97 2018-01-18 23:03:49 US Indices: nothing day Thurs, NDX tried to rally SPX was weak, going neutral to start the session tonight. Dalla weakness is threatening a collapse of the ccy and whilst that has positive connotations for stocks, I think at these lofty lvls the first move would be sharply lower

106 2018-01-18 22:58:15 Increased $GE to 4% of single stocks. Market's been in a bargain drought for months now, so I'm ok with a long turnaround for GE. I don't get some analysts' balance sheet concerns over the $6B charge + $15B reserve; GE had $78B in Q3 cash and just cut $4B/year of dividends.

121 2018-01-18 22:44:49 Criminals do not want bump stocks either, or they would be using them. These are a novelty item no one takes seriously.
122 2018-01-18 22:43:55 Celebrities against Trump are not worried about their stocks. Their concerns are people related. Immigration policy, health care, foreign policy, opportunities for the middle class, diversity, and discrimination are non-stock market concerns.
123 2018-01-18 22:43:43 Some stocks from the list were mentioned in premarket. For example I tweeted $GNC at +20% it ended day at +51% that's good to know right? And the rest: If world ends tomorrow I'll delete list, if not it's good to have a list of top stocks from previous day to help u as well!
124 2018-01-18 22:43:38 Sold most of index funds today, its been a fun long ride. markets are parabolic and I don't want to go against backtested statistics. $dia $qqq $spy $spx saving cash for buying stocks with blockchain exposure after mkt correction $ibm $nvda $amd $ostk $blok

126 2018-01-18 22:42:26 Even though our stocks are up, our dollar is weak. Does any of Trump's companies benefit from us having a weak dollar? If so, how many.  And how in the He** can Trump properties sell a flat in India w/the promise to meet Don Jr & it not be a conflict of interest?
127 2018-01-18 22:41:24 Look at the stocks he is involved in. Look what happened today
128 2018-01-18 22:40:51 Let's face it: You screwed it. I mean, by May 1896, the first Dow Jones Industrial Average was calculated using the top 12 stocks in the market. It took 121 years to reach 18k. And then, within 1 year it reached 26k. This is like the biggest economic upturn in world history. Eew!
129 2018-01-18 22:40:30 Determine whether the overall trend of those stocks go up or down?*
130 2018-01-18 22:40:27 LMAO someone is talking about how easy it is to play stocks. Stfu and stop frontin.
131 2018-01-18 22:40:18 It stocks a good range of malt whisky too!
132 2018-01-18 22:39:47 Do you apply a linear regression on the stocks of various crypto currencies, and then use that equation to determine whether the overall trend of those stocks?
133 2018-01-18 22:39:38 At the rate I’m at rn I could hit 12-14k just off stocks but my goal 20-23k
134 2018-01-18 22:39:15 You pretend to have stocks for sale? You sell properties that aren't yours? You create a brand and con MILLIONS into buying fake products?

138 2018-01-18 22:37:42 Pittsburgh was doing fine before you showed up. Believe me! Stocks closed down today...maybe because you're about to get that shutdown you pined for months ago, and left DC to stump, rather than work on it. Can't do art of the deal, when you know no part of the deal.
139 2018-01-18 22:36:00 @petenajarian on it. Can't randomly pick a stock so obviously can't randomly pick an analyst to follow. Much like stocks it comes down to winners & losers. Do your #Research @CNBCFastMoney
140 2018-01-18 22:34:04 Lows were made in Mar/Apr17, revision came in Jan18. Order flow indicators gave buyers the chance to see that stocks were not available & price rallied through to harvest. Hence no massive reaction in Jan18. The grower got screwed selling in early '17 when market was deluded.

155 2018-01-18 22:27:03 Yes, stocks suffer the same. Usually it’s penny stocks because they have low volume.

157 2018-01-18 22:26:10 @MastaRedSnappa @damanr We’ve come to the point where the Lakers can’t get blue chips so they are dealing in penny stocks.

159 2018-01-18 22:25:24 Stocks close lower with S&P at upper resistance and looming potential gov shutdown.
160 2018-01-18 22:25:17 BTW are you a hedge fund manager or do you own stocks? How is the stock market helping you directly? News flash: It's not. Also, who's gonna pay for the Wall? Mexico? Nope: Trump's Chumps (aka American taxpayers). Coal coming back? Nope. The market for coal is dying. #ObamaMAGA
161 2018-01-18 22:23:57 Also, try following the longer term charts like the monthly or weekly so you're not obsessing over every possible price dips. That's what stocks do. Straight up is not typical ,normal or even healthy. GL

163 2018-01-18 22:23:08 Nancy Pelosi got rich through insider trading. Congress voted themselves exempt from insider trading laws even though they sit on committees that can make decisions that will send stocks up or down. Any other person  would go to prison.
164 2018-01-18 22:21:40  something like that. Got a spare 35.7 million?
165 2018-01-18 22:21:37 We can actually blame both. He could have kept what was in place until Congress stopped can-kicking.

I wonder how many people shorted a bunch of marijuana-related stocks just before Sessions repealed the Cole memo.

168 2018-01-18 22:20:18 Yep.. $ba is outright ridiculous.  Even tech stocks didn't get to move like this
169 2018-01-18 22:20:16 I bet you regret that now seeing all the lies, propaganda and scaremongering was just that. Economic growth up, manufacturing up, unemployment down, tourism up, exports up, sterling climbing, investment up, stocks and bonds at all time high. Who needs the EU.?
170 2018-01-18 22:20:16 Les stocks sont revenus et ils ont repassé le jeu à 40€ ! :(
171 2018-01-18 22:19:45 Indeed they did.

It's why they're caving on bump stocks.
172 2018-01-18 22:19:37 Bump stocks?
Bets?
173 2018-01-18 22:19:02 Best part is you can cut in anywhere and add something. Really easy to work with.  Bought our kits on Amazon and our local Runnings stocks all the fittings if needed. 
174 2018-01-18 22:18:54 This will definitely effect our stocks. It did last time it shut down.

180 2018-01-18 22:15:40 After the new Nintendo Labo announcement I predict cardboard stocks will fly through the roof. There will be more demand for cardboard than ever seen in history. Everybody becomes rich. It's a gold rush. #TrashEconomy

185 2018-01-18 22:10:32 These stocks have a ways to play out yet.
186 2018-01-18 22:09:50 Invest in crypto. Milk it before it crash. And then invest in stocks and silver and gold. And establish some businesses on the side. Lastly, establish my own charity for the poor.
187 2018-01-18 22:07:36 Can't speak for all, but as a state, we're pretty savvy & understand that arctic air is cold. So, polite pass on any more helpings of arctic air. We will be glad to share muggy humidity with you once we replenish our stocks though. Oh! And mosquitoes, we've got plenty!
188 2018-01-18 22:07:35 imo you were crazy to touch it when it ran hard for 3 days ... now that it has pulled and pulled hard the entry price is much more attractive. That is of course if you still like the story. Buy stocks when no one wants them and sell when they do!
189 2018-01-18 22:07:22 lots of fear mongering, uncertainty and maybe a little propaganda.  This is the world of spec stocks.  Dont just take some guy on twitter word for a company do your own research. while $sx is a spec stock, its also not worth the bashing it receives.. a lot of it has to come 1/@

206 2018-01-18 21:56:26 While not sexy stocks / ETF's, with rates coming in to focus and bond yields up, watch TLT, VNQ, SPG and other interest rate sensitive underlyings.  VNQ below 200M on weekly after range for year+.
207 2018-01-18 21:56:20 I learned so much that could’ve been essential to adult life when I was younger and completely took advantage. ie. I knew exactly how to dissect a stock market. Now I wanna buy stocks and can’t even remember where to begin.

210 2018-01-18 21:55:52 Of course, No doubt! I’m noticing many people getting into this have never tried their hand in the stock market. This is like stocks on speed. Quick learning curve!
211 2018-01-18 21:55:05 Thats from 2010. But if you read their website today, they clearly try to pump stocks. I guess that's the price you pay for hiring an IR firm that likes to go on twitter and call out "bashers"

218 2018-01-18 21:52:09 @FIRECracker_Rev 
I like your stuff, I do. But I still don’t agree with your claim on only sticking to index funds. There’s money and success to be made in individual stocks, if you do your homework.
219 2018-01-18 21:51:24 @TeamCavuto You didn't mention during Obama's administration the only reason stocks did well was constant Fed money padding market. No one said a peep about that on your panel. #YourWorldWithNeilCavuto #quantativeEasing

It’s interesting to watch.
222 2018-01-18 21:51:18 I don't know about expert but buying high and selling low doesn't work...I've tried it!  No blog or YouTube though I do read/watch a lot. Would love to blog but not sure about stocks/crypto. Probably about learning from mistakes, it's the key to life!
223 2018-01-18 21:51:12 I think the whole fire sale of the Pirates would be pissing off a lot less Pittsburgh sports fans if it was more than just days separated from the Steelers losing to a team that has up till this year been one of the laughing stocks of the league.  We’re still hurting ya know.

228 2018-01-18 21:48:24 OK. Let's assume that's true. Who is going to fish those waters? I think we all agree the UK fishing fleet isn't big these days. CFP means fish stocks are at sustainable levels. Over stock is as bad as under. We'll be having to sell quotas to EU. Also fish don't recognise borders
229 2018-01-18 21:48:06 Dammit stop flirting with me and invest in penny stocks. They are AWESOME
230 2018-01-18 21:47:56 I gained $12.000 , I'm not a millionaires... I was just smart enough to put $500.00 into stocks as soon as I heard the libtards warning everyone to take their money out....ha
231 2018-01-18 21:46:47 But, why buy stock yourself? Maybe you signed up when people in suits showed up at work & passed out glossy fliers & setup payroll deductions. Yay! Same thing right? What stocks are in the fund you selected? How often do those funds change stocks? How often are you charged fees?

268 2018-01-18 21:32:09 The economy is going to begin to slow on jobs numbers a bit this year. More in 2019. 2020 is going to fall off a cliff with stocks bursting and everything. It will be ugly.

270 2018-01-18 21:32:02 I don’t shit on people, I shit on those who shit on others for having guts to short stocks and be open about it. That takes courage
271 2018-01-18 21:32:01 Maybe $IBM will bounce but the sell the "good news" reaction does not auger well for #stocks If this turns into an earnings season trend look out below.  $SPY $DIA

275 2018-01-18 21:30:52 I've seen penny stocks running trials through MD Anderson
276 2018-01-18 21:29:57 Long term stocks starting to finally pay off 
277 2018-01-18 21:29:05 I can see @McDonalds stocks going up!!! @mcuban @KellyannePolls @rushlimbaugh @DavidLimbaugh @IngrahamAngle @larryelder @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @VP @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump 
278 2018-01-18 21:28:35 I think millions and millions would disagree with you. You know, the whole tax cut, unemployment, black unemployment, stocks, child credit, the UN, stuff. You sound a little delusional
279 2018-01-18 21:28:24 tax savings, broader bull market, Medicare... if I knew for sure, I'd be trading stocks instead of writing articles
280 2018-01-18 21:27:29 Please put a stop to the upcoming ATF decision on bump fire stocks. Nowhere does federal law give ATF the general authority to regulate the safety of firearms, accessories, or parts. .” @realDonaldTrump
281 2018-01-18 21:26:24 You are very welcome. You will find I will stay in stocks i believe in and live thru the dips!  Not all plays are solid enough to do that, but i find I do better to hold for real runs, Doesnt mean you should not take profits on peaks here and there!
282 2018-01-18 21:25:59 DJP was a good buy in 06 2017. #stocks
283 2018-01-18 21:25:22 4:10PM Stocks have ended the day lower. The Dow closed -97.84 at 26,017.81 and the S&P 500 closed -4.53 at 2,798.03. Mortgage Bonds are -14bp at 101.56.

286 2018-01-18 21:24:45 If you're not aware, stocks tend to plummet when hiring is announced.
287 2018-01-18 21:24:17 Hang on, you think US tax cuts and deregulation make French stocks go up? Why would that happen?
288 2018-01-18 21:23:26 that’s why their stocks are dropping and they are losing money as a company lmao
289 2018-01-18 21:23:14 At least there will be ample food stocks for the start of the nuclear winter.
290 2018-01-18 21:23:05 Finally found a Tesco’s that stocks halo top ice cream .... I got three pots 
291 2018-01-18 21:22:55 if thats the case should stay and up draft stocks
292 2018-01-18 21:22:45 Ebro: “You’re making investments, doing stocks all that...?”

Offset: “Yeah not bitcoin though”


293 2018-01-18 21:22:17 I think all the coins that are directly competing with Bitcoin longterm, their value will fade over time but not vanish. There's a lot of coins that don't compete with bitcoin, can't see why they'd fail. The crypto market will swallow stock markets eventually IMO tokens > stocks
294 2018-01-18 21:22:07 I agree this scan is great for stocks. But I cannot wait until all of the crypto alt coins get added to the Trade Ideas platform soon.  Day trading cryptos with real time scans & charts. YESSSSSSSSSS!!!!
295 2018-01-18 21:22:07 I got investing in stocks on my mind

300 2018-01-18 21:19:35 It's just like real stocks. And if u had a few Lebrons and knew everyone wanted it you'd prolly do the same. But! I feel your pain. And I don't have all the answers 
301 2018-01-18 21:19:08 $CND Its actually a cool coin, Hybrid Intelligence: Imagine "Ask the Audience" in Who Wants to be a Millionaire, but for all things like: 

Polls on what the BTC hodler population thinks the coin will be next friday... 

Using Population Poll Analytics in stocks and coin trading
302 2018-01-18 21:18:34 Foreign stocks tick higher while US stocks tick lower: US -.2%; Europe +.2%. Rising interest rates and continuing government dysfunction weighed on US stocks. Potential for short-term pullback if both trends continue, especially for REITs & utilities. Better medium-term potential
303 2018-01-18 21:17:59 @realDonaldTrump 
I'm disabled, don't have a job, don't have a 401K. I'm a senior. You're bragging about stocks, jobs & wages  - what does this do for me? Higher wages & bonuses just mean everything I need to live my life just costs me more. I'm independent, but I'm going Blue!
304 2018-01-18 21:17:54 $IBM and $AXP falling after reporting earnings. Both stocks were up sharply in recent weeks/months. I noted in my article earlier how the $IBM chart said sell on earnings because it filled a major gap. Chart told the future once again! #Future #Charts #Winner #StockMarket #Stocks
305 2018-01-18 21:17:26 Wrong. Bump stocks can’t be regulated under ATF because they have no jurisdiction over the kits as THEY ARE NOT FIREARMS. I can achieve the same result with my belt loop.
306 2018-01-18 21:17:13 Ehh ya we could square away for days. America has made a YUGE (sorry I had too) recovery. Lowest unemployment for blacks and Latinos. Stocks, Dow, Wall. For those of us that want American children protected, we are happy 
307 2018-01-18 21:17:09 Nah people fortunate enough to have investments cleaned up last year. Record highs for the market. You could have accidentally made that much in returns. Some stocks are up 60%.
308 2018-01-18 21:15:57 You N Shummer must be doing a happy Dance  Stocks are going down.   N you say you work for the AMERICAN PEOPLE  NO Wonder they want to get rid of you  N that is your own party  lol   Shame on you for not putting American first
309 2018-01-18 21:15:49 Also $LTC is crypto currency... not crypto stocks.
310 2018-01-18 21:15:29 This thing was a mess but its not the CEO that manipulate stocks or w/e its people greed imo
311 2018-01-18 21:14:35 Just stocked the wall with new mods and stocks..
312 2018-01-18 21:14:30 Cause you buy stocks when the markets low so you get them cheap, then sell them when the markets high. Retirements always good to get started on tho.
313 2018-01-18 21:14:12 @EverGreenTrader I don’t mess with penny stocks.  I learned my lesson!
314 2018-01-18 21:13:41 Thanks for letting me know about these stocks.I think it is great start of the year.
315 2018-01-18 21:13:37 People whining about $SX or any other should STFU nobody forced you to buy or sell any stocks neither CEO neither Twittosphere so man up and accept that the only one responsible is you and your greed 
316 2018-01-18 21:13:27 No players bought, one sold.........so your minus 1 on your player stocks, there ya go.........done it for ya 
317 2018-01-18 21:13:16 Average of 2+ billion of volume last 30 days is low volume? I bet a lot of stocks would disagree...let alone cryptos...
318 2018-01-18 21:13:12 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
319 2018-01-18 21:13:09 Spending my day off setting up my 401K and buying into some QT stocks #adulting
320 2018-01-18 21:12:57 how much of a factor is tax planning in this allocation? is cash the best hedge for increased volatility in stocks?
321 2018-01-18 21:12:52 I think someone is dumping all Inwentash related stocks $IDK $FTEC $SX $APP all tanked recently and pretty much in unison though some more than others. This is absolutely brutal. Inwentash is trying to reclaim his lost rep from Pinetree debacle and this will not help that cause.
322 2018-01-18 21:12:47 Stocks end lower as investors fret over potential shutdown
323 2018-01-18 21:12:41 I don't disagree there. But you can swap it to something else in a few seconds. It's about as safe as high frequency trading in penny stocks!
324 2018-01-18 21:12:40 I was at CITI when the stock hit $1. I dumped my entire 401K in to it and increased contribution. Made so much!! And I’m middle class. Stocks matter to most of us, even if we don’t directly invest.
325 2018-01-18 21:12:32 Need to get the Resistance Democrats out of the way! Not one vote for Tax Reform / Cuts and now rather than fund the military, they want DACA not up until March. Stocks dropping. They hate the working American middle-class!
326 2018-01-18 21:11:35 Obama leaving office and Hillary losing is what has sent stocks up, esp when mr hope & change begged Steve jobs to bring Apple back here & he said nah fam. Dementia Donnie as you called him got Apple come back. It’s called check mate
327 2018-01-18 21:11:23 Yet another grand slam for our President.  Record high stocks, record low jobs, record high jobs created for blacks.  The list goes on and on, and this was just his first year.  Imagine what it would be like if Dems would help him instead of fighting him!
328 2018-01-18 21:11:15 Out-of-control driver stocks up on the meaning of life
329 2018-01-18 21:11:10 US stocks ended trading session of today lower and the $VIX up 0.76% to 12
330 2018-01-18 21:10:59 What about people with 401K’s? Also, what’s stopping anyone from investing. Stocks come in all prices, even penny stocks. Instead of bitching why not use your platform to teach and encourage your followers on investing and saving?
331 2018-01-18 21:10:40 Woke up to my stocks doing well. Today’s off to a good start
332 2018-01-18 21:10:14 Stocks have been relentless. I like cheap prices or a little discount at least so I d like to see some kind of sell off this qtr. Even 1 week or 2. I'll take anything.
333 2018-01-18 21:10:03 @CNBCFastMoney Good to see somebody shut that Dan Nathan up! He doesn't like Trump so he yells at anyone who is bullish stocks. #Crushed #Clown #BigNose 
334 2018-01-18 21:09:12 $ES_F $SPY $NQ_F $QQQ As long as nothing big hits the headlines during the overnight- tomorrow will be bullish - stocks head higher with the indexes
335 2018-01-18 21:08:12 Tai, you corrected me in life in the summer before i entered the 10th grade which was 2 & a half years ago. I now currently invest in stocks & cryptocurrency at the fresh age of 18 which I know no one of my age is doing. Thank you for putting light in my future of success :)
336 2018-01-18 21:08:08 invest in companies that sell tunneling equipment. Their stocks are going up post wall...
337 2018-01-18 21:07:46 Also probably one of the most underrated stocks in my opinion! A It of people over look Monster Energy

349 2018-01-18 21:01:49 Unfortunately, you have NO IDEA who the "everyday working American" is. We don't own stocks, for one thing. We don't appreciate being exploited by our govt. We don't like being deceived. Maybe that's why you're disappointed in how much praise you're not getting.
350 2018-01-18 21:01:44 All stocks go to zero with high volatility.
351 2018-01-18 21:01:19 Bought some G+V stocks today. Let's see how it does.
352 2018-01-18 21:00:58 Stocks close red. @zerohedge vindicated.
353 2018-01-18 21:00:51 a few years from now we sit in front of the potential that the low risk, conservative type stocks of today are going to be high risk
354 2018-01-18 21:00:45 DNB: total impression of this week’s US oil data was bullish. Total petroleum stocks drew a large 13.8 mboe and crude and the 4 main product stocks drew 6.4 mboe. Demand was reported at 20.8 mboe/day which is far stronger than the weak demand numbers we saw in January last year.
355 2018-01-18 21:00:04 mostly the latter. But can also be true for public stocks if you want to scout for the most mispriced assets & invest in short notice.
356 2018-01-18 20:59:34 Looking for Op to buy back. Market's been crazy so I've been day trading more than usual. Started following you recently and looks like you've made some good calls. Don't usually trade stocks below .10 but since market was so kind the past year figured would expand my horizons.
357 2018-01-18 20:59:07 yes the US stocks will have a bad day today, as well as the EU
358 2018-01-18 20:58:59 Holy shit. All the blood money from $sx shorts is being pressed on so many stocks making this market crap. This is unbelievable

367 2018-01-18 20:53:50 A guess: machines which run markets are recalibrating & will push stocks above trend into a new paradigm.
368 2018-01-18 20:52:41 Anybody with a 401K or other investments that did NOT follow his advance should thank him for convincing all of his followers to dump their stocks. They went bust while the rest of us made small fortunes.

371 2018-01-18 20:51:29 Sadly, no one can see that he hasn’t, all of this is from what Barry put into play before he left office. Stocks are up only because of the cuts dickhead has made for corporations
372 2018-01-18 20:51:05 I never bash, just saying facts! best luck!
373 2018-01-18 20:50:54 i think in the short term lithium stocks will definitely go down. whether the market then reassesses the severity of the supply side increasing materially is another question. Hopefully the market is not irrational here with the selloff.
374 2018-01-18 20:49:26 Invest your money into stocks or crypto RT @DAMNWHODAT: When Dave and busters open up at willow brook mall I’ll be there everyday gambling
375 2018-01-18 20:49:11 Schiff's shtick is to just rant and rave about the debt and Fed, etc. and tell people to hoard gold and buy some foreign stocks, etc.   Same broken clock shtick as it always was.   It can be entertaining to listen to, but has no value as financial advice.
376 2018-01-18 20:48:17 @etrade  Lack of clear consistent communication for margin calls is infuriating.  Calls are issued after -$1,000 (great!) how much REALLY needs to be covered & when is not. Sometimes you'll let that last -$200 slide, other times you'll sell stocks to cover without a phone call.
377 2018-01-18 20:48:08 And when CNBC interviews fund managers on stocks?
378 2018-01-18 20:47:55 How many ships currently fit the strike length A-70 SYLVER silos again?

How many fit strike length Mk.41? 

Which system is the better export opportunity if we build weapons to go in it? 

Which system offers large off the shelf ammo stocks with reasonably secure production?

392 2018-01-18 20:39:41 While US stocks are certainly expensive on a historical basis, all of the metrics that get thrown around the media (S&P 500 CAPE, P/E,...) do not account for new tax rate for US businesses. The metrics need a temporary discount for comparison.
393 2018-01-18 20:39:34 He used around a dozen weapons many if not with bump stocks and 100 round drums. That allows more rounds per minute. With a crowd that size he did significant damage by spraying indiscriminately
394 2018-01-18 20:39:18 Buying the league @adam_stocks_ .
395 2018-01-18 20:39:10 absolutely. 2018 should be the year vanadium stocks get some more attention and by 2019 it should be v. similar to cobalt/lithium story in my opinion.
396 2018-01-18 20:39:03 Two components of valuation: One is P/E & the other is the equity risk premium—essentially the yield that #stocks provide. Once you subtract the earnings yield from the level of interest rates for the 10-year Treasury, you get the risk premium, which is like a credit spread.

530 2018-01-18 19:34:44 I personally invest in both, and have for the past 2 years.  I think pot stocks are the safer bet and I hedge my profits in crypto with pot stocks.  I think having a diversified portfolio of crypto, pot stocks, stocks etc is wise for anyone looking for sustianbility

545 2018-01-18 19:28:06 According to a 2016 Gallup Poll, only 52% of Americans own stocks. And no, all the tax breaks should not rest with shareholders because the bill was sold under the banner that workers would benefit from trickle down. So....

573 2018-01-18 19:17:01 You should look into some money markets and blue chip stocks (maybe throw in some new tech startups?). I always say diversification is key. But first, you should make sure you have fully invested in yourself :)

595 2018-01-18 19:04:00 No. The reason is that the smart phone industry stole almost all the stocks from graphics card makers. So until next year it still will be harder to manufacture new cards. Analysts say, that 2019 is when the prices will go somewhat normalized. We'll see.

615 2018-01-18 18:55:24 If you can't pay attention to your crypto assets, the best thing you can do is STFU, leave the screen and just HODL. This advice worked for stocks also. Stocks are just more boring, principles are the same.

617 2018-01-18 18:54:10 People always freak out every time Crypto or Stocks goes down  then they think they are losing money and start selling. You are not losing money believe me. Historically it always comes back up  It’s a better way to buy when it’s low. Just stay in the game.

637 2018-01-18 18:43:23 Because of the tween below look for money to rest in BTC, ETH, LTC as these are easy to covert back to cash and quickly back into the stock market.  If market keeps swinging up and down look for these stocks to be more volatile.  Up and down but overall up!
638 2018-01-18 18:42:39 I believe the Bump Stocks is the latest buzz word to think that makes us safer. As you mention 3% of the ppl own the majority of the guns, why is this such a hard topic to deal with?

658 2018-01-18 18:32:13 3% of us own 50% of the guns, in this country.  So, the idea of assembling your own personal arsenal is not a goal of the vast majority of gun owners.  There has been some progress.  NJ just banned bump stocks and hopefully that will happen nationally.
659 2018-01-18 18:32:12 Decent day for a handful of AIM stocks;

#MKA #LION #HMI #MRS #FRR #GLR #CHAL #RRR #PYC #WSG
660 2018-01-18 18:32:03 Also, bump stocks dont work with bi pods if the weapon is used on a surface.  The bi pod prevents the bump stock from freely moving moving back and forth as the bi pod rests on the firing platform such as a table, window ledge etc.
661 2018-01-18 18:31:54 People do like groupon because they just use the service once and never return. Groupies what follow the sales only.  That is what clients have been saying. How are their stocks??
662 2018-01-18 18:31:44 BTW, the stock market is a pretty awful indicator of the actual economy. 

Indeed, nearly all of the stock ownership in the U.S. is concentrated among the richest. According to Wolff's data, the top 20 percent of Americans owned 92 percent of the stocks in 2013.
663 2018-01-18 18:30:51 Well as long as we're out of it by retirement it's all good anyway. Could (theoretically) protect against that by moving from stocks to bonds or something of the like too.  .... I should look at doing that speaking of which =)
664 2018-01-18 18:30:36 I must disagree because our people want to invest themselves here and now. Men want increases in growing markets like Ecology Engineering Investments and our government has backing to finance and claim STOCKS interest to reinvent better world solution SALES
665 2018-01-18 18:30:28 Wouldn't it be a good idea if you make out there might be a gov shut down, cause loads of hype and then when there isn't stocks rally :) @no_pullbacks
666 2018-01-18 18:29:53 Fake news. The DOW is a systematic source of Trumpism. These people aren’t making money by having their stocks reach record numbers during his short tenure as President(Fuhrer). Open your eyes America

671 2018-01-18 18:26:49 So far he's done none of that... 
Less than a third of all households have more than 10k in stocks, compared to 93% in the top 1% that do.
Also major businesses are shutting down with Trump as President, even mining jobs.

So your winning looks a lot like losing.

737 2018-01-18 17:51:38 Most Americans don't own stocks or have a 401k. So all this hype about "BOOMING STOCK MARKETS!" really doesn't affect the majority of us. It mostly affects the wealthy, because they are the ones who hold the majority of stocks & 401ks. Who cares about the "little people", right?

Yes, those stocks were in a bubble and got demolished. But what about the best stocks in the bust? Amazon, eBay, Apple, MSFT.

832 2018-01-18 17:05:24 Remember the big picture for crypto -  

There is $200 trillion tied up in cash, stocks, bonds and gold globally right now and all are overvalued. 

If 2% of that $200 trillion ends up in cryptocurrency you end up with a $4 trillion valuation which would be 9x where we are today.

848 2018-01-18 16:57:59 Microcap investors were wringing their hands in despair for months as they could not buy anything. Stocks kept climbing the rope of greed. Finally, the rope seems to be slowly giving away.

894 2018-01-18 16:40:56 I can see that. But I think that’s why you need to do a mix of investing in index funds such as the S&P and if you’re willing to put in the time and effort, stocks as well. I think the common advice is just stick to index funds, but there is success in stocks, we know there is.

907 2018-01-18 16:37:11 Hi Moses. The reason I can’t recommend picking individual stocks is all of the evidence shows that investors who do that are not likely to make more than the S&P 500 and they will be taking more risk.  I hope you will listen to my podcast for next week.

911 2018-01-18 16:36:31 Oh c'mon Philip, worth 5.1B doesn't mean he has that much money in cash in the bank. It means the stocks he owns or his share in Chick-Fil-A and his home, etc. add up to that. I'm sure he's generous with what he has, but he can't just divest himself of ownership of his company
912 2018-01-18 16:35:44 I believe that we shall eventually see a crisis in GOV as interest rates rise leading to global sovereign debt crisis, driving money into blue chip stocks and USD for "safety". This could possibly drive the DOW up to 40k. It will be interesting to see how BTC and PMs react.
913 2018-01-18 16:35:44 North Carolina, Roy Moore, Wisconsin just the week. The writing is on the wall.

People are tired of the orange one!
914 2018-01-18 16:35:23 2-cuando los comentarios de Trump bajan el valor stocks crea oportunidad de comprar barato y al subir el mismo día o en corto tiempo se vende y de esta forma crea oportunidad de ganancias a los que se dedican al cambio diario de stock.O sea ganar dinero en la baja y alta d stocks
915 2018-01-18 16:34:55 Thanks very much. I'm glad others are able to benefit from getting in at the same bottom prices I spot and not get duped by iHub bashers claiming stocks are "dead". All "real" companies with products, catalysts due, or proven revenue move up at some point if you are patient
916 2018-01-18 16:34:47 Sure. But crypto tends to be far more unstable, both good and bad. Plus it isnt as diversity proof as stocks/commodities as an aggregate are.

921 2018-01-18 16:33:32 How to get the most out of a play money #Trading contest 1. Create fake acc 2.

922 2018-01-18 16:33:24 they've certainly shut off the 'down' button in stocks.
923 2018-01-18 16:33:11 So? How about being right on your own stocks and stop worrying about others. Self-proclaimed big shot trader with nothing better to do all day then follow other people around on the net. I am doing very well this year with my blog posts to prove it.

929 2018-01-18 16:32:24 Clearly Trump didn't say the facts about Apple. They aren't giving cash bonuses, they are giving their employees $2500 worth of restricted stocks. Which can't be transferred or cashed out. It's like adopting a star you can't touch it, benefit from it but it makes you feel good.

939 2018-01-18 16:29:46 trees there arent final btw, they're for testing. those stocks n grass are too good to skip out on tho.
940 2018-01-18 16:29:30 Regarding market cap, it's the same in stocks.  I don't disagree that tethers are suspect, but market cap changes don't literally mean that much money floods into any market, crypto or otherwise.

This isn't an indicator of fake money.

943 2018-01-18 16:28:30 So i must ask ... how come the left say President Trump has not been office long enough  for the stocks to be because of him .. but yet its his fault we are so divided ...waiting
944 2018-01-18 16:28:25 Stocks may rise in nominal USD terms but will greatly fall in real terms i.e. in terms of Gold. This has to happen because of the massive misallocations of capital that have occurred over the past century.
945 2018-01-18 16:28:21 You idiots, Apple dont need tax cut to invest money as they are tax deductible, only thing Apple will do is to buy Apple stocks
946 2018-01-18 16:28:05 Many people think a 401(k) is an investment vehicle in and of itself, don't realize its just a platform for your investments for tax purposes. I used to help businesses set up 401(k) programs and it blew my mind how many times people asked "So what stocks come with a 401k?"

956 2018-01-18 16:24:11 Yes it true its part n parcel of game but the stock picking is right if u see 2008 the good stocks r quickly back on track but manipulated once never ever picked up again
957 2018-01-18 16:24:09 Yeah but Greenblatt and RenTech buy a lot of stocks - probably algorithmically - so one position/stock doesn’t mean very much. 

In that regard, $FCAU was/is the most interesting AQ Multiple stock due to huge Pabrai/Spier position.

959 2018-01-18 16:23:37 Never was any bump stocks. It is a coverup to a very secret operation. I read a theory or conjecture that the Crown Prince Of SA was there and his Uncle was trying to have him assassinated. A few days later all of the people involved, including his uncle were arrested.
960 2018-01-18 16:23:31 I mean really that's sound advice for really any stock imo - unless you have cash in your hands or in that bank you shouldn't be spending it. Stocks / Crypto currency are assets but still...

976 2018-01-18 16:16:34 I see a 10 year chart and very established trend in place. I see a “sideways consolidation period” on the chart (very common and bullish).

982 2018-01-18 16:12:22 So legit question... With the supposed tax breaks or in general terms the increase in our returns or paychecks, why doesn't the gvmt offer insentive to invest in stocks or investment matching back into the government sector? Wouldnt that pay for more shit? Help ppl save 4 future?
983 2018-01-18 16:12:03 @GOP has had no follow through and has not acted in good faith in quite some time.  Where is the bill banning Bump Stocks?  They have the votes to do anything they want.  Yet still are finding ways to blame Dems.  What a joke of a party

1046 2018-01-18 15:58:08 dan is one of the few people principled enough resist this disturbing regime instead of jumping on the train just cause stocks are going up.  that said, rich ross was right, calls the market right, and was only saying its futile to try to trade crypto off the charts

"Hold or sell?"

"This stock is falling!"

Folks who are in for the short term, traders or those who are leveraged should apply SL and exit.

Long termers and those who are convinced of their stocks should hold on.

1066 2018-01-18 15:52:16 Ya saw this this morning. Doubt the stock will rise though. Too much shit with legalization going down right now and the US everyone scared of weed stocks... I think I’m a few months this company will be laughing though and the SP will be 7-10$
1067 2018-01-18 15:51:49 Whens the last time all your stocks were up 40-100% in a day? I wonder if when the dow crashes again all money will flee to #crypto just sayin
1068 2018-01-18 15:51:40 It's all in how each person sees it.... we see more jobs, bonuses, increase in pay, 401K, raises, etc etc... some of this is temporary, but by then another admin will be in place and then it's up to them to take hold of it. Right now, checks are better, stocks, etc. come on now!
1069 2018-01-18 15:51:31 So far the turn around seems legit. #TRX and #XVG are biggest upswings on my list at 54% and 43% up respectively. Crypto stocks also doing well across the board. Will hold positions for another 24 hours probably before looking at trade and growth opportunities.

1082 2018-01-18 15:45:12 Thank you for the in-depth analysis of stocks..  people like me are benefiting with such study. There are many parameters which I am trying to understand.
1083 2018-01-18 15:44:51 Hawkish Fed-speak, weaker US treasuries weigh on EGBs
• European stocks rally, EGBs trade with modest risk on bias
• France taps €7.5bn in total of 3-yr, 5-yr & 6-yr: mediocre results
• Spain taps €4.1bn in total of 5-yr, 15 ½ -yr & 29-yr: reasonably solid results
1084 2018-01-18 15:44:50 On Thursday, the domestic bourse closed in the negative as investors took
profit on large-cap stocks. As a result, the All Share index eased
marginally to 0.1% at 44,848.74 points. Consequently, the market breadth
index declined at 0.90x with 28 gainers and 31 losers. @nsenigeria
1085 2018-01-18 15:43:52 Word never should have had power to begin with.  Not to move stocks like it did. but as we know stock trading is about 85% nonsense 15% logic
1086 2018-01-18 15:43:31 • Brent Crude holds above $69 as Nigeria unrest threatens supply
• Shanghai Composite gains 0.91% as banking and consumer stocks rise on global growth optimism
• UK December RICS Housing Survey 8 (exp 0, prev 0)

1091 2018-01-18 15:42:01 All good stocks to measure flows. There is also one subtle stock almost so ephemeral as to be a flow itself:

In the absence of continual external reinforcement, we must be our own monitor, and QUALITY OF PRESENCE is often the best gauge.

1094 2018-01-18 15:40:33 Stocks start lower for a change as rates move higher to 2.6% on the 10 yr. this is the risk from tax reform. But with real estate already in decline. It will offset some of the growth created by tax reform. Is this Goldilocks economy?

Same with trading stocks, got to focus on safe trades only instead of forcing trades just to trade. You're actually making money when you're not losing it.

1147 2018-01-18 15:26:11 We are so much extended that 0.5% pullbacks  just look like a flat market for the day. Declines are always proportional to the prior advance hence this could down a lot more and still be just a minor pullback. Dangerous territory for speculative names! #stocks

1165 2018-01-18 15:20:20 Do you even understand what stocks are? Your comments reflect fundamental ignorance. Where do you expect people to tie their liquidity - in their mattress? It's like saying "nutrition is tied up inside people". What is your better solution again?

1168 2018-01-18 15:20:00 Ugly reversal day for $LUV. I'm always surprised that stocks are able to have 52 week high when algos constantly shut it down at resistance.
1169 2018-01-18 15:19:52 This kind of stocks have a different behavior. After the open, usually they're more short seller oriented. Of course it's not so simple like that, but might help you get an insight.
1170 2018-01-18 15:19:47 Bump Stocks John! Remember Vegas and the guy that killed 50+ and injured 500+? He used Bump Stocks. We want them outlawed because they effectively turn a Semi-Automatic weapon to a FULL-AUTOMATIC weapon. Introduce the Legislation JOHN!!!
1171 2018-01-18 15:18:55 $SPY As recently mentioned, expecting more volatility. Be selective on which stocks. Some will go up but not all will continue higher.

1180 2018-01-18 15:16:03 Not surprisingly junk stocks like $MOMO rarely has a FTD after a big day. That's why they're junk for a reason.
1181 2018-01-18 15:15:40 Huh. Again, seems like you don’t understand. I’d be happy to help. How do you buy stocks? If you don’t go directly to the company, you use a broker. You don’t call Apple to buy apple stock, you go to a brokerage, probably an online one. That’s what I do...
1182 2018-01-18 15:15:12 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.

1189 2018-01-18 15:13:21 Agreed.  Those slow moving metrics will turn up. First, stocks "look forward" & "price in" what is expected in future. So, higher consumer & business confidence, etc. means higher earnings, jobs, spending... growth.

1207 2018-01-18 15:04:02 P.S. You need to rebalance your portfolio. The DOW was up 25%, and my portfolio increased by 28%.

You left tons of money on the table.

Less than 20% of Americans own stocks directly, and only 50% are in the market through 401K, etc.

This leads to more wealth inequality.
1208 2018-01-18 15:03:59 I think I spoke to you about it a few years ago & I think if the portfolio achieves what you want given your constraints (time, interest etc) & you stick to it, I will be happy for you.

1247 2018-01-18 14:52:28 In my opinion, this is the key time frame to look at. This is when investors started to talk about "there is no alternative" to buying stocks & riskier assets for income, since government bonds were yielding less and less. This dynamic is starting to shift.

1291 2018-01-18 14:36:28 Stocks up, jobs up, Apple paying 35 billion in taxes on over seas money, isis beat down and more. You can report that to if you'd like, Media. Ha but you won't. #cnn #MorningJoe
1292 2018-01-18 14:36:20 Trump will allow offshore drilling in a billion acres of protected Arctic, Pacific and Atlantic waters, fouling our oceans, damaging our fish stocks and coating our beaches. Remember Deepwater Horizon. Deformed trout, blotchy dolphins and vanished oysters. Fishermen unite!
1293 2018-01-18 14:35:47 I think you're more than likely right. Walls must be built and immigrants must be kept out for safety and security.
But the biggest mass shooting in US history was a single home-grown madman with bump stocks. Nothing has been done about bump stocks.

1396 2018-01-18 13:59:05 Completely disagree with that statement. It’s possibly the biggest transfer of wealth that gives financial opportunities to the lower/middle class. You don’t have to be a millionaire to be making investments; whether that’s in crypto or stocks/shares.
1397 2018-01-18 13:58:52 Good stuff, Mike. I think we’re both detached from the reality of the average investor. You should see the emails I’m getting from people who are tired of picking stocks and just want something easy. They don’t have the patience or discipline that you have.

1459 2018-01-18 13:27:23 Wife, your tweets contrast difference between left & right.

They seek to remove spec in our eyes while unaware of plank in theirs.

1522 2018-01-18 13:04:30 As a 30 year veteran securities trader, stocks that are bankrupt and going to zero still trade and have a price right up until the moment they stop the listing at the exchange, and then it often trades off-exchange unless forced to shut down.  Why? Short sellers buying back.
1523 2018-01-18 13:04:15 Are stock markets bull putting everyone in danger by reckless buying over valued stocks as Dow Nasdaq reach new highs?

1642 2018-01-18 11:47:41 I’ve always wanted to trade stocks and I would have been happy with 1-2% a week profit. With crypto it’s pretty much 100x that or can be.
1643 2018-01-18 11:47:18 Great question, but it’s not how invest - the greatest book I ever read on the topic of investing is How to Make Money in Stocks by William O’Neil — it’s who I worked for straight out of the Marine Corps — the book changed my  life - hope it helps !!

1665 2018-01-18 11:30:53 In the dotcom days you could make a lot of money buying shit headed to zero after it took that first big plunge. Had to make sure you didn't linger. 

Different in stocks, traders that were heavily short that crap wanted to close positions, holding short to zero was a nightmare.
1666 2018-01-18 11:30:48 @zerodhaonline Do you provide facility to automatically buy stocks as per defined schedule, like daily, weekly, etc? If yes where is that option?
1667 2018-01-18 11:30:21 Because it’s good to buy quality when it’s cheap! Cycles do turn. Patience is however required. Retail sales numbers out yesterday were amazing. Despite WHL average numbers. Eventually WHL will have its day in the sun. Buy while stocks last ?!

1675 2018-01-18 11:26:34 Another interesting feature would be buying fractional shares like crypto.  Opens the market to buyers that can’t “afford” $100/share stocks so they buy penny stocks. New crypto buyers buy “cheap” crypto for same reason also (and they want huge returns like btc)
1676 2018-01-18 11:25:43 I didn't check but think while stocks last 
1677 2018-01-18 11:25:11 The same way all the others do it. Bribery, 'special' deals in stocks and insider trading
1678 2018-01-18 11:25:04 You could buy the best possible stocks and wait on them for a really long time. But if you don’t bet enough, you won’t make enough.
1679 2018-01-18 11:24:55 I'll open a store in maybe feb or when my supplier will have stocks of the merch that I'm supposed to sell. It's official and unnoficial and I'm going to try my best to keep it at low price. Will yah buy?
1680 2018-01-18 11:24:33 Let the future decide that. There have been stocks in the same postion and condition and theese have chocked people. Im out +1000% so no interest up or down at the moment
1681 2018-01-18 11:23:55 #LION We know news imminent on a number of fronts but imagine if we get NEWS on a MasterCard tie that would be phenomenal success.

I've been stating the 2 stocks that represent the best value and huge scope in my opinion is #LION& #THR

1683 2018-01-18 11:21:45 Exactly. People want $AAPL to buy companies whose stocks have p/e’s of 200?!!! The time to buy $NFLX (ok) or $TSLA (stupid) was 3 years ago!
1684 2018-01-18 11:21:01 @freewyolife this is probably a stupid question but how'd you get into stocks and trades and stuff like?

1686 2018-01-18 11:20:00 @BMTheEquityDesk  Sir, stocks have high eps , high roe , small equity and huge potential in consumer with consistent growth. What could be risk here ? Management ?
1687 2018-01-18 11:19:01 Stocks, investments.
1688 2018-01-18 11:18:39 Stocks are the “ New Bitcoin “ in terms of trading
1689 2018-01-18 11:18:31 The value of debt will not change but there is a risk that assets can (housing and bank & stocks). And, according to your no.s, debt has more than doubled while gross wealth has not. 267% v 190%
1690 2018-01-18 11:17:39 So your charts says that stocks that bore the brunt today, are highly likely to recover back and continue for new highs?.
1691 2018-01-18 11:15:40 When the stock runs out,masternim only got 20 stocks. So I think it’s very soon.
1692 2018-01-18 11:15:39 Cant find this on Bloomberg website to create link but on Bloomberg radio a major domo of Vanguard funds said that stocks are pricey and if I heard right a 60 40 stocks portfolio would outperform all equity portfolio over next decade. please provide link if you ve seen it. thanks
1693 2018-01-18 11:15:11 Smart ppl may be keeping indices high so that they can unload non-indices stocks at better price..once they r done, indices will crash
1694 2018-01-18 11:15:07 Split? Like stocks? That does not change the market cap.... this is fooling people.
1695 2018-01-18 11:14:50 The demand is low, and the prices will fall further. Sugar stocks may go down tomorrow.
1696 2018-01-18 11:14:35 Presume that effects estimates of progamme are net not gross. So, suspect miscalculation is due to flows & stocks problem. Programme effects measure how many people get positive outcomes quicker not whether you turn a failure into a success permnently.

1713 2018-01-18 11:03:59 Businesses get tax breaks here.   A lot.  It's always sold to the public as a means to "stimulate the economy."  It doesn't.  They use the money to buy back stocks, move it off-shore, etc.  Not much of the money gets circulated.
1714 2018-01-18 11:03:02 Yes @Am_Shai created bot to pick up 3IB move from stocks by EOD..I don't track stocks for this due to spike nature of them..but track it closely with Indices for last one year and mostly winners..

1724 2018-01-18 10:55:21 #Stocks,#Indexes So, is this recovery to SPX 2800 "spurious"? It was signaled, BUT such poor bottom-signaled rallies usually sell off back to where they started. Situation is ambiguous, no surprise. Upshot: holding SPX long; awaiting next signal of either type.
1725 2018-01-18 10:54:47 That i often do,
gets tedious,
was trying to make it Auto & Simpler,
as in putting all your Portfolio Stocks in a sheet & getting all Updates for them

1730 2018-01-18 10:51:28 Regarding repeals of Regulations:

1746 2018-01-18 10:40:18 It's so scary though! So many fail or run off with the money. Maybe just stocks? At least then it's a real product...?
1747 2018-01-18 10:38:55 No, they don't - do the research. Bass stocks are dangerously low and EU making it worse for starters, cod only recovering because stocks were so bad the fleets looked elsewhere
1748 2018-01-18 10:38:11 Apparently, hundreds of crores of FDs and being prematurely withdrawn to invest in stocks. Is this wrong?
Similarly, several crores of FD's are being converted to equity by PSU Banks...Is this correct? Recommend to cash out the FD's and put in a balanced portfolio fund.
1749 2018-01-18 10:37:35 What exactly you are looking for? - Results for all stocks?. Dividends? or Something else

1847 2018-01-18 09:19:44 View on Market Breadth - 

Last few months participants shifted their index trades 2 stock specific trades. So a trader instead of index was trading in stocks. 

Now with breakout in index he shifts back to it. Adv/Dec ratio will not be +ve but dont take this as -ve indicator.
1848 2018-01-18 09:18:38 I really don't see how a stock market record rise helps the lower and middle income earners. This, like the recent tax reforms, puts money into already overflowing bank accounts. The majority of workers can't afford stocks and shares

1856 2018-01-18 09:16:24 As an aside how many stocks do you hold in your portfolio? I'm trying to get the balance between more cash in high conviction plays versus holding lots of stakes in lots of companies I think can all multi bag (but don't know which ones will). Eg #STAR or #RGM or #DKE all could.
1857 2018-01-18 09:16:00 I've been trimming quite a bit. Some of these stocks have shot way past my targets. Still looking to get some intc though.
1858 2018-01-18 09:14:12 So glad I put almost nothing into Bitcoin and Litecoin when I finally decided to start playing in those waters. Lost a third of my investment already. Meanwhile the stocks I’ve been buying since are slowly improving.
1859 2018-01-18 09:11:15 Markets will always test patience. Moreover do not buy stocks because i or anyone else highlighted it. Buy a stock only when u yourself are convinced with the valuations.

2144 2018-01-18 05:36:55 It’s not a real cash bonus. Restricted stocks are basically a certificate for a certain number of stocks (right now it’s about 14 shares) that can be cashed in once the vesting period is reached. If you leave before then, you don’t get the full value.

2158 2018-01-18 05:24:02 And that's trumps fault? Really? How biased van you guys get? The economy is doing  great.  Job are being created.  Wages going up.  Stocks up so if people invested in a 401k or IRA they'd be benefiting too.
2159 2018-01-18 05:24:01 Stocks go up and down and get manipulated too as we've all seen. Doesn't change a single thing about the company. Long term man...give it time to execute on the biz cycle = huge winner imo.

2176 2018-01-18 05:17:01 Yes. International law (UN regulations regarding the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks) will still apply and as most our waters fall into this category you won't actually see much change.

2196 2018-01-18 04:56:50 The “turn $40 to $400” is a pyramid scheme & it’s not teaching you how to invest your money for the future just fucking people over. How about do an Equity Mutual Fund to begin with than educate yourself more about stocks, bonds & other securities.

2213 2018-01-18 04:49:22 Maybe when they talk about diversifying they are talking about different markets, like Crypto, stocks, real estate, commodities.
Markets usually move unanimously, I don't see much benefit in diversifying too much in one particular market and ignoring all the others.

2243 2018-01-18 04:29:04 How it has changed the global economy. Until very recently, speculation on most commodities, currencies, stocks etc were limited to brokers, or rich people going through brokers. Now everyone and their dog can do it. How has that affected the ratio of value to cost?
2244 2018-01-18 04:28:42 Yes, sell puts on stocks you want to own at a 10% to 15% discount in 3 or 4 months. If a stock is $100, sell a $90 to $85 put, if you can. In catastrophes, take your loss rather than an assigned stock.

2278 2018-01-18 04:01:02 If I find stocks expensive or risky i will sell. Doesn't matter what the popular opinion is. It is better to sit on cash for a few months in wait of a correction rather than sit on losses waiting for recovery.

2295 2018-01-18 03:51:40 alternatively ppl can just buy a cross section of quality businesses like 10-15 stocks  that have minimal leverage. however the dividends on these would be 3-4 % even after imputation credits. Buying big four banks for their dividends is just dumb

2300 2018-01-18 03:49:30 That's easy to claim, much harder to prove. It's foolish to believe that Trump truly wasn't responsible for any of the stock market. With  tax beaks and lifting regulations, it's only logical buisnesses will boom and stocks will rise.

2304 2018-01-18 03:48:55 @paulkrugman Hey, you win an award for being the best in Fake News. You said the stock market would crash if Trump was elected. I hope you sold all your stocks when you said that, because you have lost a lot of money. Market up to 26,000 from 18,000. And you are an Economist? Huh
2305 2018-01-18 03:47:47 Choice of plenty .. what will you buy. Infra, banks or oil related stocks? What about HUL & L&T? Too many choices! This is what happens when the markets fire on all four cylinders. Do not forget valuations please and buying only for long term. Got me steve?

2313 2018-01-18 03:46:03 Not falling for the soaring #StockMarket. There is no way stocks should be climbing this fast given all the escalating political and environment risk. Something is fishy. Only question, for those who don't want to be caught holding the bag, is where to hide until the crash.
2314 2018-01-18 03:45:47 Corrections under very bullish circumstances end as a higher bottom and also, during corrections, higher tops made as in "running corrections(current one)/ irregular flat".

2319 2018-01-18 03:41:41 Jobs are jobs & stocks are worth money. With booming economy & market that $2500 could quickly grow.
Also those 20,000 jobs will create $20+mil in tax revenue.
Win win all around. Cook gave credit to tax reform and predicts strong economy from it.

2321 2018-01-18 03:40:15 I think he could (prob should) go higher than that even. His D has really surprised me, improved a lot since last year. Stocks are meh but he moves his feet well, gets around picks, takes away air space, doesn't make too many mistakes. Needs to add strength ofc.
2322 2018-01-18 03:38:32 @SavvyInvestorPM 
I agree that day trading is a loser’s game, but what’s wrong with pick individual stocks, investing in companies, and holding for the long-term?
2323 2018-01-18 03:38:00 Just because the stocks decreased doesn't mean YG is dead. We don't need to be so alarmed. Everything will be stable again with new releases. :)
2324 2018-01-18 03:36:54 Lol I'm hipp think we treat it like stocks now
2325 2018-01-18 03:36:37 For the elitists Democrats who have seen their stocks rise, are you going to resist by liquidating your portfolio?   Crickets 
2326 2018-01-18 03:36:28 Close enough. Whether you invest in the market, real estate or baseball cards investment values fluctuate. You can diversifyvis s 401k or get really good at choosing jndividual stocks. The point is that thd market is an indicator of consumer confidence.
2327 2018-01-18 03:36:21 Repatriation of funds from overseas is starting as anticipated. They are over $2.5 Trillion top compnaies. 
The Dow jumped 322 points to a record-high 26,115, 
Tech stocks got a boost from Apple, which erased losses after announcing plans to repatriate billions in overseas cash.

2329 2018-01-18 03:35:56 So what how's your stocks  doing
2330 2018-01-18 03:34:58 People who are up against linking their bank accounts, insurance policies, investment in stocks and bonds are those who hide their source of income from govt. There can't be any other reason for such halla bol.
2331 2018-01-18 03:33:49 I’ll respond for the guy on CNBC:  Stocks went up 170% in anticipation of earnings growth and have continued to rise because the earnings growth has been confirmed.
2332 2018-01-18 03:33:48 World class? Are you Dreaming! The World sees President Trump as a total complete idiot! People around the World are selling their stocks as the don’t trust America and its President! They see a World wide market correction coming and they lay the blame on Trump! America wake up!
2333 2018-01-18 03:33:09 #DonaldTrump tweets...empty threats by calling out companies #Amazon #Boeing #NYTimes have being ignored by investors as BS!....in fact their stocks have sky rocketed!

2340 2018-01-18 03:29:49 Heard of a lot of scams .. it’s real but you got to buy into stocks.. anything else any middleman shit is gonna be trying to go for your pockets .
2341 2018-01-18 03:29:42 Pretty impressive that you won first place from the president for the worst fake news of the year.  Keep up the great work and maybe you can win it again in 2019!  Hopefully you sold all of your stocks when Trump got to be president so you didn't go broke!
2342 2018-01-18 03:29:23 @wsbarkercfa overlooked a winner.
May I humbly suggest @TMFChrisHill’s catch phrase, which would consequently look great on a @themotleyfool mug: 
“As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about...”
2343 2018-01-18 03:29:07 Stocks, shares in companies, had 3 bitcoin that I sold , im not spending 90-100 I'm gonna put like 40k down and he I'll make the monthly payments after
2344 2018-01-18 03:28:16 This might be your best tweet ever.  You have restored my faith in you.
2345 2018-01-18 03:27:05 Shoutout to @MrGoodBeard__  for the stocks and brokerage account advice I didn’t understand until now 
2346 2018-01-18 03:26:07 HODLing is effective in stocks and real estate, too. Timing is difficult and you eventually get burned bad no matter how good you may be. Trading puts you at odds with Time. HODLing aligns with time. Time always wins.
2347 2018-01-18 03:25:43 when we get good stock which runs if it has strong fundas and future prospects with strong results what else you wnat ride the winners Moving out of winners & uumping no so quality stocks looking for immediate gains can erode the capital
2348 2018-01-18 03:25:34 Juan is showing his ignorance. Pension and 401k plans own a significant holding in corporate stocks, which benefits many of the common people.
2349 2018-01-18 03:24:40 Glenn called me up to tell me how his stocks are doing. He's telling me each one individually.
2350 2018-01-18 03:23:49 I was doing a Finviz scanner. How the heck are there 1372 stocks over 10 dollars, under their 200 SMA ?
2351 2018-01-18 03:22:46 A LOT OF LONG TERM MONEY WILL GET PULLED OUT FROM BIG NIFTY STOCKS TODAY AND TOMORROW.

2353 2018-01-18 03:21:55 $POT $WEED How much time, effort, energy does it take to make a $1000 profit on pot?  Vs mining 1 $ETH ?  (I'm talking start to finish into cash money).  If Pot stocks can get ridiculous 5-10Billion valuations then #crypto stocks are WELL behind.

Stocks can be dilluted and there is no finite amount.
Bitcoin has a limit on how many there are. 
It gets really weird with options and etf's, which are side bets.
2355 2018-01-18 03:21:24 Its stocks. Not cash. I don't know if I'd call it a "bonus"  - but nonetheless, good overall.
2356 2018-01-18 03:21:22 So i guess you took the advice to bail out of stocks when Trump won? Because with a crazy unstable mad man in the white house, the economy and stock market would tank.  Good call.
2357 2018-01-18 03:21:09 Money printing has lifted stocks and bonds!!!

2379 2018-01-18 03:05:57 SNSD having only 1 comeback, was promoted only for 3 days because they were sabotaged by SM and who had no stocks on their albums that's why they'd have only 100K plus. Proud sone

2383 2018-01-18 03:01:59 An noob investor asked for advice regarding investing in MFs. This is 1 of the responses that he got:
"This is all well & good but you know what's truly awesome? Buying stocks yourself. It's the most challenging, gut-wrenching and satisfying thing to do with your free time" 
2384 2018-01-18 03:00:35 I love the crypto market..it makes stocks and bonds so archaic. The incoming regulation is going to be such a buzzkill. Yes some of us don't need our hands held to invest our money.
2385 2018-01-18 02:59:10 On Nov 26 2017 DJIA was at 23500. That's still pretty close to an all-time high. Cashing out your stocks now is a perfectly reasonable investing strategy. There will be a correction eventually, unless of course This Time is Different(tm)
2386 2018-01-18 02:59:01 you mean all of them idiots who have convinced my parents that the reason why their stocks are doing so well & the economy is doing so great is bc of Trump? it took every ounce of restraint to bite my tongue & not tell them he has nothing to do with it!!

2390 2018-01-18 02:57:17 I agree with the live another day part. only in India a large cap stocks swings like that. Breaks every textbook definition of a large cap behaviour.
2391 2018-01-18 02:56:07 Stocks/shares mean you own tiny pieces of a company, when a company makes a profit they share out that profit among stockholders as dividends. That's basically it.

2439 2018-01-18 02:33:52 Depression followed a decade of people buying new consumer goods with credit and buying stocks on margin. The 50s boom was based off tech innovations and military spending in the post WWII. The 90s boom came from technological innovation. Tax cuts don’t play that big a factor.

2450 2018-01-18 02:29:52 the Dow isn't growth. Of course the nominal value of stocks is higher than ever. (The nominal value of everything is higher than ever. That's how nominal fiat values work.)

2452 2018-01-18 02:29:26 Like investing stocks or crypto you shouldn’t go into YouTube thinking it’s a get rich quick scheme. Shouldn’t even start if you don’t have something to fall back on or in this instance time > potential money to make.

2458 2018-01-18 02:25:21 $FIT Reminds me of many stocks in 2007 that were artificially sold off to generational lows even though there was zero chance of insolvency.
2459 2018-01-18 02:24:44 Most important here is  trump, has a problem with the 1st a amendment. but will support the 2nd, even at the cost life . But has no problem Bump Stocks . At this time  remember October 1, 2017,· At least 59 killed, 527 injured in Las Vegas shooting.

2464 2018-01-18 02:21:49 I'd need to know your risk tolerance, liquidity needs in terms of tax deferment, amount of capital available, etc.. It'd be irresponsible of me to just throw a few stocks at you. Strategy matters.

2471 2018-01-18 02:17:50 I've been self-employed more than half of my working life. I own no stocks. I support independent businesses. Damned if I'll humor bitter extreme leftists calling me a "corporate Dem."
2472 2018-01-18 02:17:10 You can't be serious? Let's look at the trends then?  Obama...down &moderate up (in some measures).  Trump - multiple spikes up in jobs, stocks, economy in general. This clearly shows he is doing it.  ...also, how long ru gonna hang on to "Obama's Legacy"? He hurt America badly.
2473 2018-01-18 02:16:56 Fitting that pseudo economist @paulkrugman is the #FakeNewsAward grand prize winner. Bet the moron sold his stocks the day after Trump's election. #dow26000

2486 2018-01-18 02:05:57 US stocks rose on Wednesday as the Dow solidified its hold on the 26,000 milestone. The Fed’s Beige Book portrays an economy that is growing steadily, although opinion on tax reform was mixed.

2577 2018-01-18 01:19:34 Is the current rally in US stocks "pulling forward" future returns and making expected returns going forward poorer? (Please retweet.)
2578 2018-01-18 01:19:04 If one of the loser mainstream networks broadcast this, their stocks wouldve risen higher than todays DOW.

2581 2018-01-18 01:14:42 No...they companies don't NEED the income. Its the same thing as the mythical welfare mom. If you can make more money on stocks why have storefronts? If the government pays you to offshore why hire Americans wanting a living wage?

2585 2018-01-18 01:12:08 @MelissaLeeCNBC please thank Dan Nathan for keeping us grounded, I like hearing his opinions the most on your show. Can you stop inviting Pete Najarian to the show, he is shameless self promoting bastard. I know what he is going to say before he does, based on the stocks he owns
2586 2018-01-18 01:10:07 Nice facts... so you are saying that the company, if stocks where traded would have more value. But the coin?
The partnerships are with the company. The coin is only a potential means. I think lots of people missjudge the coins for company stocks.

2591 2018-01-18 01:06:41 Geoff—employees can invest in stocks, 401Ks, etc. most large companies offer this or even a matching formula.  If they choose not to do it, that’s on them.
Your cool with them taking pensions right?
2592 2018-01-18 01:05:58 Feel a bit awful that I didn't think to invest in stocks and bonds years ago. But I'm in now and it's going pretty good as a start. Years to go. #letsgo

2600 2018-01-18 01:01:31 In my 20s when J Hayes was in the stocks. My parents, then in their 50s, likened it to Salem. Why are Gardai now delivering this “revelation”? We all knew J Hayes was not the mother of Baby John, and a murder enquiry re Baby John was botched.
2601 2018-01-18 01:00:35 There are characteristics that have been proven over long periods to be associated with above-average rates of return: low P/Es, discounts to book value, low debt/equity ratios, stocks with recent significant price declines, companies with [insider buying] -- Will Browne
2602 2018-01-18 00:59:25 Ah feel you’re pain. (Care for a cigar?) But we’ve been there and done that with these names. The value in these stocks has always won out in the past. I expect no different this time around. My income knowledge comes vicariously through your career but this too shall pass.
2603 2018-01-18 00:58:41 Often I've realized on penny stocks is when we have a downtrend followed by a steady line, there's often a reversal. My opinion

2615 2018-01-18 00:54:25 The reason there is not "fake news" in financial news, @slategabfest, is because the only incentive to lie is to pump stocks. And then the SEC put you in jail. Which is what the law should do if you lie about regular news. There are such laws many places outside the US.
2616 2018-01-18 00:53:57 Wait until the regular market crashes and then buy amazon, Walmart and some of the medical field stocks. We should have done that during Great Recession.
2617 2018-01-18 00:53:54 Brandon, Thanks for the great info regarding this portfolio. Just curious on how you determined what stocks to put into this portfolio? Many of the stocks I own but wanted to get your feedback.
2618 2018-01-18 00:52:58 #Stocks,#Indexes " . . . anything is possible", including a BOTTOM signal, first thing tomorrow. What actually transpired today was a series of 3 SPX bottom signals, each very poor (good bottom signals take >=1 days to emerge). This could go on into the morning, maybe longer.

2621 2018-01-18 00:52:18 I get where it’s coming from but it’s wrong in my opinion. I wouldn’t take advice on stocks for someone who does it every once in a while vs someone who does it for 8hrs a day. Same goes for here

2628 2018-01-18 00:47:46 Your money will grow at least 5% a week if you invest in the right stocks 
2629 2018-01-18 00:47:43 This by far was the best year in a very long time for IRA’s. Using Asset Allocation in a diversified Portfolio you made more money than in many years. And lower Corporate taxes should boost stocks much higher in many coming years as well.

So please exercise caution &  stay liquid &  keep your stocks list ready

2638 2018-01-18 00:42:57 Is that really any different from getting into stocks? It's just another kind of investing right? I dunno, all the hype makes it look like easy money but obviously some people are losing big. Seems like blind luck unless you're already a smart investing person.
2639 2018-01-18 00:42:33 And unless you own stocks or have a pension that is invested this means nothing

2650 2018-01-18 00:36:58 I invest in stocks. Mostly companies I think are having an impact like Tesla for instance. I am not trying to get rich but investing in world changing innovation.  Over the long term there tangible businesses will pay well.

2653 2018-01-18 00:36:01 Odd. Can't see them diluting in a stock with such low volume. The most they could pulling in per day is about 5k.
2654 2018-01-18 00:35:26 Someone wants it at $1.00 for something.  My thoughts are that they have a deal and it was based on $1.00/share.  I've seen this before on other stocks.  This way someone gets more shares.   Not saying that that is happening here but this was the most bizzar couple of days.

2658 2018-01-18 00:33:21 we a assuming u started ur portfolio with $1million and brought all 30 stocks as of 31/12/2017. ur portfolio would be up 3.57% as of today's date!!!!

2664 2018-01-18 00:28:11 Dividends give you nothing , often wiped out by capital losses.  I’ll stick to stocks and earning 30-35% per year versus a 3-4% dividend yield
2665 2018-01-18 00:28:07 @caseyresearch famously pointed out that he didn't understand gold or sound money, either. Doug Casey called him an idiot savant of investing in stocks. It's all he's good at.

2668 2018-01-18 00:26:56 I see economics is not your strong suit. Corporations are people owned.... i.e. stocks, & have to answer to the share holders. NOT the CEO. If your not investing in those companies I can’t help you.

2674 2018-01-18 00:23:32 Yes companies have given bonuses.  Very little cost to them with billions saved by them.  It would be like giving a person $10.00, and I get $10,000 as a company .  Major companies stated the money will go to shareholders and to buy back stocks.
2675 2018-01-18 00:23:15 This will help those who own stocks and bonds. Nothing for the average Americans except more taxes after 2018, jobs are giving bonuses and laying off large numbers, insurance is going up, and no relief in sight. Enjoy 2018.
2676 2018-01-18 00:23:10 I would imagine cardboard maker stocks are skyrocketing right now

2678 2018-01-18 00:22:25 Is everyone else waiting for their fill on $SRK offscreen also ... Whenever stocks becomes available it gets nicked. Just a few hundred K more please 
2679 2018-01-18 00:22:21 Absolutely nothing because the majority of Americans don’t own stocks and companies will take those stock dividends and give them to shareholders not hire or increase wages. The @gop is running a ponzi scheme
2680 2018-01-18 00:20:15 A nearly certain sign the top in stocks will occur within days: margin   requirements for futures, such as /ES, were just raised, despite a lack  of volatility. This is to margin-call/short-squeeze out the few remaining bears.
2681 2018-01-18 00:20:05 I never said the majority. I said the little guy. My version of the little guy fits into the 48 percent of Americans who have no stocks. You must think little guys are much bigger than I do.
2682 2018-01-18 00:19:04 No he’s not willing to save Free Open Internet He must have stocks in Internet Service Providers b/c it’s not Votes he’s resigning.

2683 2018-01-18 00:18:26 The only thing Trump has brought to the US is positives. The economy is growing, stocks at an all time high, jobs are coming back. All you Libs need to chill out and let the man do his job. Oh and Politics season is usually around November, Not the middle of January.
2684 2018-01-18 00:17:45 I think even if I couldn’t wait, i would as I’m not willing to pay amazon over 100% higher in price to get it a few days early. If I traded stocks that way, I’d have to file for Chap 13!
2685 2018-01-18 00:17:44 I'm glad you'll attend Zanger's seminar in April after he took a 2-years hiatus. My suggest is: before attending his show, you should get familiar w/ chart patterns & also read the book "How to Make Money in Stocks" by William O'Neil. It'll help u understand his teaching greatly.
2686 2018-01-18 00:16:34 So, the lawful citizens do the lawful thing and turn in the bump stocks. The bad guys still have them, and a black sales market blooms run by additional criminals. A lot like Las Vegas.
2687 2018-01-18 00:15:47 In my experience many people are exited about decentralization (no doubt speculation lately became excessive). Besides how many people invest in stocks or any other asset with objective other than higher prices?
2688 2018-01-18 00:15:28 Just note that the crypto channel scans are not for ALTCoins yet. They are being added by the programmers shortly at TI. The scans that exist now for crypto are stocks that are blockchain/crypto related.
2689 2018-01-18 00:15:24 short all of the blockchain based stocks and you could make some money to go towards that beauty of a watch.
2690 2018-01-18 00:14:53 Trump has done a lot to help America, he has a New York attitude of my way or piss off but what he’s done for the vets, jobs, stocks. I’m watching, I’m waiting...
2691 2018-01-18 00:14:33 According to Gallup, just 52 percent of Americans own stocks, including those who own stocks as part of a retirement program.
2692 2018-01-18 00:14:15 these are some of my most favorite set ups for sure.
2693 2018-01-18 00:13:46 $WEED Massive news after the bell, 175M$ bought deal at 34.60$. They are gearing up for buyouts IMO and I believe $CANN.c $CANN could be first on their list since they already have a deal with them #acmpr #stocks #cannabis #investing
2694 2018-01-18 00:13:18 As congressional comity collapses & political paralysis worsens, I don't expect agreement on the continuing resolution until we've had at least a few days of government shutdown. So the parabolic move in stocks will likely peak Friday to be followed by a brief but sharp sell-off.
2695 2018-01-18 00:12:51 Australian #cannabis stocks more digesting than lethargic thru my lens; gonna be a massive build-out with a super-friendly government.  They're where Canada was a few years ago and they'll service #Japan / nicely.
