A mass knife attack is less deadly than a mass shooting. If Stephen Paddock was armed with a knife rather than multiple semiautomatics and bump stocks, there's no way he'd have murdered 58 people and injured more than 800 within 10 minutes.

38 2018-10-28 23:43:19 It’s gotta be the stocks app
39 2018-10-28 23:42:24 I used to get excited about stocks, stock picking, finding winners, etc. Fundamentals were a key driver of my theses.
IMO Now: Technicals
40 2018-10-28 23:41:26 @jimcramer Jim. I’m recently retired and 95 pct in stocks, index funds and TRP and Janus mutual USA stock funds. Go USA. Should I sell somethings and buy bonds? Which bond funds and how much. All bond funds look crappy to me versus stocks. Need 3.5 to 4 pct return for 30 yrs.
41 2018-10-28 23:39:18 And my stocks are kicking a$$, oh, no wait, they're not.  Reckoning day for your BS tax cuts is rapidly approaching.  Bending America Over Again.
42 2018-10-28 23:37:40 damn, i miss having a bloomberg terminal.  U stocks definitely due for a bounce here so fits nicely with historical seasonality as you point out.  Also looks like broader market poised for a bounce....could be a nice set up into year end.
43 2018-10-28 23:37:36 'In FACT...the NYSE closed after the attacks and did not reopen until Sept 17 because many of the workers were lost or injured in the attack on the World Trade Center...and much of the communications and utilities needed to trade stocks were damaged or destroyed.'
44 2018-10-28 23:37:28 It also increased the deficit. People's wages did not increse. More people are buying on credit. Wages are not in step with the rising cost of living. Btw. The final drop in stocks wiped out all gains for this entire year. What can possibly go wrong?
45 2018-10-28 23:35:52 Anyone use ThinkOrSwim to monitor stocks?
46 2018-10-28 23:35:36 Now that stocks, property markets are falling, I wonder how many people will suffer a deeper depression because their over inflated assets have fallen in price.
47 2018-10-28 23:33:22 Talked to my dad about the market and mentioned that I was going to buy more stocks. He goes...
48 2018-10-28 23:33:19 Lopetegui's stocks have certainly fallen through the floor in a few short months.
49 2018-10-28 23:32:23 Nobody uses bump stocks to hunt and in most legal hunts, you have a capacity limit in your MAGAZINE. Do fucking research before speaking. It’s unreal how stupid so many people on your side of the argument are and yet STILL speak.
50 2018-10-28 23:32:03 AUD May Fall with Nikkei, Euro at Risk. Markets Eye Brazil Election: Emerging markets and USD/BRL eye the Brazilian election results as Euro prices are vulnerable after the S&P Italian outlook downgrade. AUD may fall as Asia stocks follow S&P 500 lower.
51 2018-10-28 23:31:35 IBM was one first stocks I ever bought, used to perform, haven't looked at it for long in decade, too much other stuff to trade. $BRZU has my attention, been hitting it hard on trades, about to bust a leg higher imo
52 2018-10-28 23:29:40 Transferred the farm from stocks to silver and gold. Open your eyes people.
53 2018-10-28 23:29:06 Focus on cash flow instead of earnings would have lead investors to safety in stocks like Enron long before they blew up.
54 2018-10-28 23:28:07 Where are you located Conny? We’re working on Loblaws/RCSS stores right now but we would love to direct you to another retailer that stocks SUPERTONICs! 
55 2018-10-28 23:26:09 Hey that's great but stick to stocks.
56 2018-10-28 23:26:05 Stocks
57 2018-10-28 23:24:49 When kahlil blu said, “I blow like stocks.” I felt that...
58 2018-10-28 23:22:17 Red Hat value to IBM was 63% more than it was to investors on Friday. That’s an instructive lesson to investors who keep selling tech stocks based on unrealistic fears.
59 2018-10-28 23:21:42 A house isn’t a home until people are in it, just as a Portfolio isn’t a Portfolio without Stocks, Bonds, and Funds in it.
60 2018-10-28 23:19:22 Dow Jones 30 Futures
24,821.0 +75.0  +0.30% 

The Dow is in the “plateau” and I am watching Hedge Funds continuing to purchase shares of select stocks. This isn’t because they see a Bear trend. My call is a higher Dow above 26k before year end based on earnings.
61 2018-10-28 23:19:19 depends how big a fall you have, timing, and whether you buy high yielding stocks. Long Term Buy and Hold does well and prob has greater divi exposure. A lot plan to be LTBH but easier said than done on falls of 10% in a month imo with all best intentions
62 2018-10-28 23:19:18 @RobinhoodApp Do you support transferring stocks from @Computershare to Robinhood currently ? Last I checked only ACAT transfers were supported ? Is their a plan to support ComputerShare transfers also in the near future ?

i love him i love us askdjhakjsh
64 2018-10-28 23:17:02 And I never said the stock market is evil or amazing. 80% of stocks are owned by the very wealthy. It was all artificially inflated by the stock buy backs. The growth in the GDP right now is being driven by consumers or sparrows, not the “job creators” or horses.
65 2018-10-28 23:15:22 Huge deal to help the tech stocks as $ibm is buying $rht for $190 in cash. Wouldn’t be surprised if ibm goes up also. $adsk $wday $orcl $adbe
66 2018-10-28 23:15:01 Great job on the book you guys! Love it!!!
67 2018-10-28 23:14:10 The Aussie market has opened higher to start the new trading week as the #ASX 200 lifts 40pts or 0.7% to 5705. Banks, miners & health stocks driving the market gains most #ausbiz
68 2018-10-28 23:13:04 Bump stocks are a blip on the radar, even dedicated gun nuts hadn’t heard of them until Vegas. Don’t let them claim “change” by banning an obscure gun accessory. Ban AK & ARs! No reason any citizen needs one.
69 2018-10-28 23:11:27 Haha i love this!!! Stocks are now $420!!!
70 2018-10-28 23:10:55 Googles ‘Bobby Davro stocks accident’ #InsideNo9
71 2018-10-28 23:10:48 i’m crying. why is this amount in HUF??? that’s like $7 USD
72 2018-10-28 23:08:27 Stocks are a rich man game has nothing to do with people in general
73 2018-10-28 23:05:55 No, but that is a particular feature of methadone in the US. Certainly in Canada it's hard to find a pharmacy rurally that stocks it, but I could find you one in any suburban neighborhood that does. No need to go downtown.
74 2018-10-28 23:04:40 Who wants to know the top earning publicly traded marijuana stocks
75 2018-10-28 23:04:08 You should teach your son to respect women.
76 2018-10-28 23:03:25 It's honestly so rude when my stocks go down. They should be ashamed of themselves.
77 2018-10-28 23:03:16 "Unlike real estate or company stocks, virtual currencies have no real value and only attract 'charlatans.'"
78 2018-10-28 23:02:29 Just by seeing both Embraer and Petrobras stocks' response to the first round... It's kind of a done deal.
79 2018-10-28 23:00:03 just coinz then, not stocks?
80 2018-10-28 22:59:48 My asset allocation of 65% in stocks and 35% in bonds is only down (3.65%) ytd. I guess not keeping my whole life savings invested in risky assets was a prudent idea. I will sleep well tonight. I have 10 years until FIRE, so I will keep buying and rebalancing until then.
81 2018-10-28 22:59:24 Man this reminds me of 2015 FinTwit when we’d all just pump our stocks Skele style
82 2018-10-28 22:58:40 So?  THE SHOOTER WAS A FANATIC TRUMP SUPPORTER INSPIRED BY TRUMP'S HATE MONGERING RHETORIC .... AND ABLE TO HAVE BUMP STOCKS BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S EO ALLOWING IT
83 2018-10-28 22:57:10 Are growth stocks no longer favorable at this time?  Or can we still play BTFD on some excellent names with some base development...
84 2018-10-28 22:56:56 Look at you go with all that huf! Which is about $67 American
85 2018-10-28 22:56:08 As a holder of $TSU and $VIV, I hope that Brazil stocks get a bounce tomorrow, but a Bolsonaro victory was widely expected in round 2 of the election...it's not really surprising news.
86 2018-10-28 22:53:57 The first thing I did was Google "Bobby Davro stocks"
87 2018-10-28 22:52:49 Pretty sure this will help shorting the highest valued Cloud stocks.  This deal won't be viewed positively for more than Hr's.  Most worth their salt will mock the deal as they should.  As well as saying it's a further sign of what occurs at the tail end of cycles/Bulls etc.
88 2018-10-28 22:50:54 Well, you know his mouth-breathing “super elites” don’t trade stocks and believe Obama was president on 9/11, so he gets away with it.
89 2018-10-28 22:50:54 hi tech stocks are falling cuz those lleft wing propagandists are in big trouble

96 2018-10-28 22:44:56 Starting to sell some US curve (10s30s) after this horrific steepening move. This trade will also act as a long $ES_F proxy. There seems to be some consensus between the traders I follow closely that we see a face ripping rally in stocks soon.

103 2018-10-28 22:36:36 C’est le seul moyen de liquider les stocks de 1080TI qu’ils ont trouvé pour forcer les gens à passer aux 2080TI ? 
104 2018-10-28 22:36:35 I think you’re right, that they’d blame it on someone else. I mentioned to my mom that my 401k has decreased quite a bit the last few days, and she was like “that was that one day bc of the pipe bombs that the stocks went down, they’re going up again so it’s fine.”
105 2018-10-28 22:36:09 This is where I actually drink some of the Austrian school kool-aid, when your money supply is inflationary it hurts the little guy, people who are only saving, and don’t have appreciable assets like real estate and stocks. Only around 15% of Americans own any stocks.
106 2018-10-28 22:36:02 Shorts increased 500 percent on October 10 according to otc short report and this yielded little results for shorts.Stocks obv and accumulation index is up with pattern emerging and without shorts we cannot get gravity to make a 10 bagger thankyou
107 2018-10-28 22:35:17 An investor can go for weeks, months or years without making a trade. In the 9 year bull market in stocks I traded a little every 2-3 years. I haven’t traded Bitcoin in almost 10 months. Our Webinar on Nov. 3 will explain why and how. @lucidfunds.com
108 2018-10-28 22:34:46 And still bump stocks are legal. Nothing will get better as long as republicans are in charge.

114 2018-10-28 22:31:27 Remember when I used to chop it up with Kyle Singleton about nerd shit like investing in stocks, owning atm's, finessing iPhone prices, and buying billboards. Yea....we just brag different 
115 2018-10-28 22:30:33 Stocks and bonds keep the "old money folks" rich as hell

But yeah keep "playing the stocks"
116 2018-10-28 22:30:29 As if we weren’t the laughing stocks of the World, already, with Brexit!
117 2018-10-28 22:28:07 I really like mine. I use it mostly for steal cut oats and rice. I'm beginning to make stocks & broths more. I've had it for a year and haven't used the slow cook function yet.
118 2018-10-28 22:27:38 $IBM is the Sears of Technology stocks. 

$RHT purchase is too expensive. This will not be a good marriage.

119 2018-10-28 22:24:49 Seen somewhere earlier they were saying couldn't say who was in it cause of the businesses he's involved in n shares or stocks would go mental so had prepare for that first. Not sure how true that is

Put all their savings into mustard stocks. Can't retire.
124 2018-10-28 22:16:12 How about legislation that prevents massive waste of taxpayers dollars flying the nationalist potus to his hate Rallies?  Or even baby step - ban bump stocks. GOP has controlled both houses of Congress since 2014.  Do something instead of hand wringing. No more #scamInvestigation
125 2018-10-28 22:16:06 He will tell them that he is going to ban bump stocks in two weeks.
126 2018-10-28 22:15:49 And you just missed that clip of Bobby Davro in the stocks

129 2018-10-28 22:10:08 No-the point of that site is the EASY ACCESS in buying a gun! And while we are speaking of this-YES there are bump stocks to make rifles more automatic. No one has used hand guns as their main weapon of choice in mass killings as far as I know. I’m PROUD to NOT be a gun owner.
130 2018-10-28 22:07:10 Live below your means. Have cash available so that when it's not different this time you can shop: real estate, stocks, debt. Be patient.
131 2018-10-28 22:06:27  What does that even mean? Because of BTC, companies that sell goods and services or make products won’t make money anymore? STOs are just stocks in tokenized form. What does BTC have to do with equity ownership in companies, also known as stocks?

134 2018-10-28 22:03:32 Most of the companies are trading 20+% lower than the beginning of the year.

I would guess they would take advantage of the low interest rate (cheap money still) to buy their stocks back with a steep discount, creating shareholding value

Plus, there were no real crises in sight

138 2018-10-28 21:58:54 You see, dog, your presidents tax cuts were great for the stock market because owners and shareholders got huge kickbacks in the billions, whereas workers received maybe a 4% increase or nothing at all. Stocks go up and to balance it Social security and healthcare have to he cut.
139 2018-10-28 21:58:48 Just some of the bio tech stocks to look at today $GTG $PAA , all cancer researchers hopefuly bringing some good technology to the world
140 2018-10-28 21:55:57 I fool around with semiconductor stocks.  I should pay heed to your expertise(you know me as the relentless troll on John Muller’s FB Wall.) Currently long $Intc and $AMAT.

As favourable diplomata to the daybreak,

Listening as the confidential permission
Of departed reputations where the tracing has battled--

A poem should be succeeding
As the stocks of lightings.
142 2018-10-28 21:51:29 -With the US economy growing strongly, they may soon decide they’ve been freaking out too much. A sustained upturn in bank stocks may show that their optimism is returning. But if they remain in the doldrums, real trouble may lie ahead (NewYorkTimes).

145 2018-10-28 21:50:03 Bump stocks are a gimmick and a red herring for the Left to yell about, they do nothing. You basically can't buy an "assault rifle" at any age. We have background checks.

So come back when you have some facts.
146 2018-10-28 21:49:53 @lovestocktwist1 @Pr0fit_Designer just wanted to take up all the characters, was just naming stocks for the fun of it
147 2018-10-28 21:48:58 Ok. Semantics.  It’s semi automatics right?  And then people use the bum stocks to rig them? My ignorance of guns themselves is not a liberal effect.  It’s bc I don’t own one
148 2018-10-28 21:48:31 Has nobody here attended a business class or at least knows minimal knowledge about how the stock market works . “ bts oppars impact” bitch no big hit stocks are also dropping .
149 2018-10-28 21:48:28 If you really cared, you'd do something. You promised a ban on bump stocks. You lied. You promised raising the age to buy an assault rifle. You lied. You promised background checks. You lied. Worst president ever.
150 2018-10-28 21:46:28 All I do is think about stocks
151 2018-10-28 21:46:00 What are stocks?
152 2018-10-28 21:44:38 If stocks continue to fall, and the economy slows, then the love and adoration for Trump will begin to waver.

The Trumpers who have chosen to follow him are only concerned with their 401Ks and stock portfolios.

If those fail then he will no longer be their savior.
153 2018-10-28 21:44:03 Are you sure the word Vampire was not in there somewhere?
154 2018-10-28 21:42:34 After much pressure from AT&T we finally agreed to switch to DirecTV. They FAILED to show up for two different agreed upon nstallation dates. I assume they no longer desire our business
155 2018-10-28 21:42:02 Don't Forget when u vote. Dems failed policy. Now we have thousands off food stamps, record low unemployment, Americans bringing home more home, record high Stocks, Business back in USA. EVERYTHING I wrote is provable. Vote GOP keep America safe. N. Korea is no longer testing
156 2018-10-28 21:41:39 Normally skip over Chris Dillow in the IC but saw this week he said stocks to rise after Halloween. Always knew he was a top bloke. Ramps away!
157 2018-10-28 21:40:02 Haha. The warriors also sometimes come out slow at home. I’m more of a bonds than stocks philosophy. Day trading ain’t my thing

160 2018-10-28 21:34:45 No, its NRA is good, NRA-ILA derailed the purpose of the NRA. Gun rights is not about ensuring that everything that can be dreamed up is available: large capacity magazines, bump stocks like in LV are moronic yet they contributed to 58 killed 489 wounded in LV.
161 2018-10-28 21:34:14 (the kid's right)
162 2018-10-28 21:33:45 Hmm - it seems like investors should *want* some long vol exposure in order to get higher Sharpe ratios. 

Calendar spreads, for example, have almost the same theta decay as short straddles but less delta exposure. 

Stocks + 1-year puts have higher Sharpes than stocks alone.

165 2018-10-28 21:32:31 Was a great r/r play for long term. They’re still in infancy stages of expanding, but they’re gonna grow, and the stocks going to grow with it. HABT is still very cheap when you compare it to SHAK
166 2018-10-28 21:31:22 Do you have bits of wood you keep, just in case you might need them?
We had lots that we cleared from our old cellar.  Took them to a bonfire & many men were eyeing them up, even proposing they could use that.
Now rebuilding my stocks in the new house. Would prefer bikes instead.
167 2018-10-28 21:31:19 Also I think your suggestions are good. Don't see a reason for bump stocks. Also think weapons such as AR-15s should be harder to obtain versus your basic handgun. But I don't see how any of that keeps crazies from getting them, ultimately.

171 2018-10-28 21:28:20 Yes, mainly by pattern, relative strength and group. Watch list stocks pivoting on volume would elevate them, IMHO, to Focus list status.
172 2018-10-28 21:26:04 A mixed day for the USD on Friday as stocks remained under pressure. The US GDP data came in at 3.5% from 3.3% expected but there were some investment concerns in the breakdown which pushed the USD onto the back foot.
173 2018-10-28 21:26:03 It sure would be nice if just once dump& the NRA would be held accountable for all this ! Am sick of it. No one, with the exception of the cops & military, have any business owning a machine gun& certainly no bump stocks! Dump promised to ban the damn things, but lied again!

175 2018-10-28 21:24:46 FX Summary: A mixed day for the USD on Friday as stocks remained under pressure. The US GDP data came in at 3.5% from 3.3% expected but there were some investment concerns in the breakdown which pushed the USD onto the back foot.
176 2018-10-28 21:24:06 While I was marveling at the young damsels on our campus, my son said, "Yeah. Halloween is basically the girls' excuse for dressing up as various forms of hookers."
177 2018-10-28 21:22:38 It’ll continue to decrease a bit. But then the value of stocks such as nestlé, daimler, sap, carrefour will goes up... anyway i purchase gold and silver too 
178 2018-10-28 21:21:37 BAN ASSAULT RIFLES, BUMP STOCKS, ETC., P E R I O D  IMO!!!!!
179 2018-10-28 21:21:34 James why doesn't that surprise me we could never ever trust ABC NBC or CBS that would recommend everybody drop their stocks because I have. Let's see what happens if all of us in this stock drops to the floor
180 2018-10-28 21:19:43 And corporate tax revenue is down. Turns out stock buy backs really only help the shareholders. And 80% of all stocks value in the exchange is owned by 3-5% of the population.
181 2018-10-28 21:19:30 Descuajeringaron todas las variables económicas. Reventaron los stocks. Inocularon valores muy negativos en el patrón de conducta y se mueven en la mentira. Encima, la recuperación es c/viento de frente, un Papa incapaz y peroncho y Bolivia y Venezuela infiltrándonos. Dios!
182 2018-10-28 21:18:54 You better get off of Twitter. You clearly do not know who is holding stocks in it. You know, just to be consistent.
183 2018-10-28 21:18:18 Real Wages: Down
Inflation: Up
Interest Rates: Up
Stocks: Flat
184 2018-10-28 21:17:41 Sp500 still showing lots of weakness. Lots of negative chatter about. Again stay out. If you do get involved, buy stocks at support that show relative strength and sell into strength. Here are the current best, again only buy those that hold: $kss $cree $gddy $ttwo $tsla
185 2018-10-28 21:17:08 So 18-20 year olds should be allowed to buy semi-auto rifles and accesories like bump stocks?

I don't see any issue with longer waiting periods. It's a gun, not a meal from the drive-thru.
186 2018-10-28 21:15:35 Literally any form of gun control? Idk, maybe ban bump stocks, the one thing the NRA was ok with? Restrict purchasing of assault rifles? Make licenses require the kind of testing we have for cars?
187 2018-10-28 21:15:09 
188 2018-10-28 21:14:03 SPIKER COMBINE stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
189 2018-10-28 21:13:50 During the previous administration, so-called "bump stocks" were approved by the ATF because these devices helped people with physical disabilities. They did not anticipate that some psychopath would use them to turn a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic weapon.
190 2018-10-28 21:13:43 It's bringing out cryptocurrency on a small door throughout projected recession in two and half cycles from now via instability of other currencies.
Stocks go down.
Bonds go down
Forex goes down.
US dollar weaker over euro (1.15-1.35).

191 2018-10-28 21:13:39 apple stocks rise by 69%.
192 2018-10-28 21:11:58 What does this mean for the broader FAANG stocks? Is this a catalyst to move up after an ugly October? Not that October is over yet!
193 2018-10-28 21:10:37 After the Las Vegas massacre, the President and Congress initiated the steps to ban so-called "bump stocks". There is a long evaluation process by the ATF for handling potential unconstitutional legislation; that process is nearing completion. President Trump will sign the ban.
194 2018-10-28 21:09:09 My moms shit bf is talking about how trump made his stocks go up
Fuck off :)
195 2018-10-28 21:08:38 Hi Barry. Legal immigration is one thing, I'm all for it. I am NOT for unchecked, open borders. Also not for unbalanced trade policies. These two items are carefully interrelated.

I don't like the practice of large corporations going long and short nations like they do stocks.
196 2018-10-28 21:08:12 España ha salido a la calle a las 10 de la noche un domingo para ir a agotar todos los stocks de las tiendas de @MediaMarkt_es
197 2018-10-28 21:06:45 Thanks mine is Amerifunds and only buys American stocks. America is not doing as great as they pretend. But I stay, because I don't have a choice and it's kind of the right thing to do
198 2018-10-28 21:05:34 This is great for cloud stocks unless your still short.
199 2018-10-28 21:04:41 Agreed. I’ve lost about 3 grand in stocks this week and every single one of them has gone done it’s the whole market. Nike has honestly dropped the least out of all of my other stocks
200 2018-10-28 21:04:25 you forgot their new one.  We are banning bump stocks very soon
201 2018-10-28 21:04:22 The nine recessions since 1956 began a median of eight months after a primary S&P top. This corroborates the recent post that one cannot predict mkt direction by simply looking at economic health #stocks #economy
202 2018-10-28 21:03:58 I am also a little more conservative than just 100% VTSAX - Moved my portfolio to a lower return / lower volatility mix over the past couple years.  Some specific lower risk/return stocks, some REITs, some cash.  It still hurts to fall, I'm off ~ 7.5% instead of 11% in this drop
203 2018-10-28 21:02:45 Hi, dear. I'll check muna if may available stocks pa.
204 2018-10-28 21:02:13 I dont know about that.  Everytime I sell my stocks it usually takes minimum 4 days to get to my bank account.
205 2018-10-28 21:00:36 i’m looking for an alternative source of income, so i got into stocks
206 2018-10-28 21:00:30 Wow you pick stocks these guys think you have mystical powers over them
207 2018-10-28 20:59:40 It's not odd at all. Think about how the company's stocks would go down, investors would pull out! His company would go to zero in minutes!
They take all aspects into consideration before they release any reports.
208 2018-10-28 20:58:57 i agree but these tech stocks aren't just going to drop to zero
209 2018-10-28 20:57:56 Breaking down consumer spending, unemployment rate, labor market, nominal growth, wages, inflation, the relationship between stocks and bonds, and other factors like the election, @LizAnnSonders shares her full market perspective. #SchwabIMPACT
210 2018-10-28 20:56:55 My health care is great, my job is great, my stocks are soaring! People who have real jobs appreciate all of those things!
211 2018-10-28 20:56:05 My simple estimates are based on:

US stocks =  long-term corporate earnings real growth + dividends + buyback dividend + inflation (Fed est) - valuation regression (back to 16 x earnings).

Bonds = 10-year Treasury yield reinvested

Less 0.25 for fees.
212 2018-10-28 20:55:44 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
213 2018-10-28 20:53:58 I corresponded with you over  supporting the banning of AR15 and other semi automatic weapons as a common sense and compassionate policy.  You gave me some boiler plate "I'm a supporter of the 2nd Amendment" line and said you would do something about bump stocks. NOT GOOD ENOUGH!
214 2018-10-28 20:53:36 Wala Sa Probinsiya .. naglakbay pa sa SM North EDSA ... last na daw.. trying to call the nearest @foldedandhungph kung pwede sila kumuha ng stocks and sizes .. sabi nung isang sales lady baka daw hindi sila magpahiram ..aruuy
215 2018-10-28 20:53:22 @ovi8 must give away thousands of dollars worth of stocks every season. He is a true class act. I’m no Caps fan but I have nothing but the utmost respect for this man  his kindness is endless
216 2018-10-28 20:52:43 Actually an AR-15 is not an assault weapon. It is a semi automatic hunting rifle made to look like a fully automatic machine gun, which it's not, which is why it's legal. Bump stocks that make them imitate a fully auto, should be illegal.
217 2018-10-28 20:51:42 @realDonaldTrump I lost everything on stocks that I have made on the last year! How come you aren't talking about the stock market!? Another 2008 coming? Need a Democrat to straighten it out!
218 2018-10-28 20:50:44 Bonjour dsl mais nous ne communiquons pas sur nos stocks via les réseaux sociaux
219 2018-10-28 20:50:40 And when the truth is spoken with facts & receipts, they consider us 2 be all laughing stocks. These Nazi's  refuse to help mitigate racism, where we could all work together as a single unit, in order to yield functional results.
220 2018-10-28 20:46:51 This T-shirt business is as bad a reach as people thinking the Big 3's stocks dropping had anything to do with other groups and not because of the global shit storm that every fucking country is going through both politically and economically.
221 2018-10-28 20:44:48 You can be a responsible gun owner and not agree with the NRA on all issues! Bump stocks and military style weapons have no place in a society where just about anyone who wants a gun can obtain one! Who’s opposed to being sensible? We just need a champion!
222 2018-10-28 20:44:14 Indeed, I also felt that way when Skype redesigned their app and when AIM shut down.  I’m not sure how long Twitter has left though either based on their stocks.
223 2018-10-28 20:43:13 Why be proud of this economic activity? Doesn't make me wealthy. I'm in the 99%. It doesn't improve my standard of living. I don't own stocks and I'm not a CEO with a golden parachute.
224 2018-10-28 20:41:38 @twatoski  Hurry while stocks last.

226 2018-10-28 20:40:11 In summation, in the near term investors can expect relief for EM stocks, but watch the immediate environment. And for the long term? @JeffreyKleintop says now is the time when rebalancing is more critical than ever. #SchwabIMPACT

229 2018-10-28 20:39:03 I don’t want to ban guns, but automatic ARs, bump stocks, & extended clips are weapons of war. That’s why we have militia in form of State National Guards. Normal citizens shouldn’t have access to something capable of killing 10-50 people in mins. Demo mobs aren’t a real thing.
230 2018-10-28 20:37:55 I still think that man could learn something about community from this majestic species. Their compassion, empathy, memory & innate intelligence would be enough to thrive were not man's greed & need to possess & conquer the reality that stocks their fate.

233 2018-10-28 20:35:20 At times of great pessimism, such as the early 1950s, stocks sold at less than 15 times dividends.
In early July of 1998, the price-dividend multiple soared above 70
234 2018-10-28 20:34:49 I have told several coworkers about XRP, some have bought, many think crypto is a big scam. The sad thing is that they will have to live with the regret of not taking advantage of this life changing opportunity. They say buy stocks, I tell them to get out of stocks asap, oh well!
235 2018-10-28 20:33:56 Is this why stocks and financial markets are DOWN for the year?

237 2018-10-28 20:31:47 Something that usually helps me is finding someone willing to set a handicap to like 100 each and then set it to a ton of stocks, then continuously resetting neutral to begin each new stock.
238 2018-10-28 20:31:39 Stocks to Bonds were very high too.
239 2018-10-28 20:31:05 There's the debatable bit though. Does he destroy the economies or does he see an economy about to fail and sell his stocks in it. You know like all who play the markets do. Problem is him doing it causes others to

241 2018-10-28 20:28:58 Market summary – The sheer number of waterfall like breakdowns in stocks and groups is alarming. This seems to be forecasting the economy hitting a brick wall...at 100 MPH. A mean reversion rally is a high probability, but real trend change for the better will take time 
242 2018-10-28 20:25:15 As a corollary, @kitcoNewNOW needs to do a better job of holding the feet of mining executives to the fire.  This was another dreadful quarter of earnings & the excuses never end.  Gold is up 200% since 2003 & gold stocks have gone nowhere!  No more softball interviews!

257 2018-10-28 20:10:16 27 days ago “Don’t Boo” Heller (R-Adelson) celebrated one year of doing absolutely nothing about assault weapons, bump stocks, background checks for domestic abusers, the mentally ill, even terrorists. America’s most mediocre senator couldn’t even react to a Nevadan tragedy.
258 2018-10-28 20:09:04 I believe the S&P indices have a nice niche in the market. They have a long track-record, which is why their AUM is stable and strong - however the larger indices are starting to look more similar (Vanguard put out an index which has similar stocks as S&P)

273 2018-10-28 19:55:01 He probably was still relying on that money. Never do such things. Also in case the value of stocks rises many people think they are rich already but you don't have any of the money yet. I want to make an in depth article about risks etc and ways of thinking around it.

325 2018-10-28 19:08:50 It lets them compare their current returns (presumably picking individual stocks) to investing in an Index fund.

E.g., in scenario I gave, if you spent 50h/year picking stocks over the last 10 yrs &  you got 7% gain per year and saw that the Index got 9%/year, what would u do?
326 2018-10-28 19:07:01 Portfolio balance channel.. crush the return on bonds to force investors out the risk curves to earn any yield. Also, SNB buying ~90b US stocks, BOJ ETFs, ECB corp bonds, Fed mtgs directly to influence risk premia
327 2018-10-28 19:06:46 The Trump economy is still terrible for so many average Americans, while the rich keep getting richer.

329 2018-10-28 19:03:11 Timing the market with options is as impossible as timing the market with stocks. The difference is that you also put a timer on your bet and you are leveraged. The other side of the trade is big banks that make money with a decent 20% overhead of what is the fair price. LOL

353 2018-10-28 18:43:50 Very true. Just to give you an idea how outdated & slow the TSXV is, I recall the time in 2013 when CSE stocks where not tradable via regular bank platforms. The TSXV had all the headstart needed to fix their affairs & more, but they never where bothered.
354 2018-10-28 18:43:24 I’ve done this before.  They hype it up to get you to buy.  Then THEIR stock goes up because you buy, then it caves.  You also get bombarded with their emails AND charged for their newsletter that you forgot to cancel in time.  Having said that, pot stocks are going up.

357 2018-10-28 18:42:17 Another scam was a stocks buyback. As a top-manager I had the power to affect the process of selling and buying shares, so I made a deal: the state-owned company sold a block of share for 20 billion dollars and then bought them back for a 15x increased price – 300 million dollars
358 2018-10-28 18:41:37 Wt is the reason for stocks declining

382 2018-10-28 18:27:06 The fact is bump stocks were used in many of these attacks specifically to get around the limits of manufacturers to produce weapons that are legal. There are plenty of non-sensical things we do like taking off shoes at airports, but a logical step on guns is unfathomable to many

387 2018-10-28 18:21:07 Bump stocks are highly inaccurate and inefficient. It’s illegal to make any gun automatic as well. How will reform stop something that’s already illegal?
388 2018-10-28 18:20:24 I need to figure out how stocks work..
389 2018-10-28 18:20:02 No one can predict for sure where stocks and bonds will go next, let alone dictate it.
390 2018-10-28 18:19:38 I’m excited about next week and not just stocks 
391 2018-10-28 18:18:20 Bump stocks are a pointless thing to ban. If I want a bump stock, I'll use my belt to get the exact same result.
392 2018-10-28 18:16:51 And just how are bump stocks a gimmick if they are an effective way to increase the weight of fire by using the kinetic recoil to push the weapon forward. There are many videos describing how they work. Less effective then other means? Sure, but it’s also easily acquired.
393 2018-10-28 18:16:20 banning anything that is semiautomatic seems like a logical start and I am not sure why any citizen would be against that! But then again the killing of school children hasn’t even banned bump stocks - pretty sure we need to vote new people in office!

396 2018-10-28 18:13:35 What’s the most u made off investing in stocks
397 2018-10-28 18:13:14 It depends on the beta of the stocks , if small caps then beta will be high so 1.2 to 1.5 times delta is recommended, if stocks beta is equal to market, then you can sel 1 delta, suppose if you have portfolio of 7.5 lacs , you can sell  2 atm call where delta of atm call is .5
398 2018-10-28 18:10:29 Just up from a nap to eat, and noticed they haven't turned the machines back on ....

2. The ASC shield lock is escapable but still leaves you in a bad spot

3. Aura caps at 190 when stocks are even

4. Jump is the safest option when caught in ASC by ledge or at kill %

5. Lucario is hot

408 2018-10-28 18:02:52 It's the opposite for me, trading stocks/forex has been a good training ground to accumulate more bitcoins by trading alts. With the low volatility there's not much trading on bitmex, so alts currently are the only option for me.

412 2018-10-28 17:57:07 If you think that you don't need to manage risk because you only buy "quality" stocks, then I'm afraid you're in for an unpleasant surprise.
413 2018-10-28 17:56:30 Sadly, he again met the expectations of the majority of Americans w his inability to have empathy. BTW, Americans are being slaughtered & threatened; stocks dropped so much in the last week that all the gains for 2018 have been erased; tariffs are causing layoffs. NOT WINNING.
414 2018-10-28 17:53:50 No.  My assumption is that it will get funded out of “stock”, but w/cap gains + taxable IRA distributions = ~200% of PCE growth, funding US deficits out of “stock” will require selling stocks & therefore negatively impact PCE (& that ~200% doesn’t include corp stock options.)

416 2018-10-28 17:52:02 You're a UX student, so imagine this User Story, then look at my prototype:

You are a stock investor. You have been picking stocks yourself for 10 years but you read A Random Walk Down Wallstreet that shows that it's tough to beat the expert investors and...
417 2018-10-28 17:51:50 @Beasley2019 just like a Buisness. With gains and loss. Incomes of gains is taxed around 30%. stocks held over 2 years is a tax write off.
418 2018-10-28 17:51:18 "Spray" Lol clearly know nothing about guns. It's the same rate of fire in pistols & can modify in the same way. Bump stocks are a gimmick
419 2018-10-28 17:51:10 As for me...I am all for banning bump stocks, and whatever else makes a gun “close” to an assault rifle. There’s no need for it. However, just because some asshat walks into a place of worship and does this, doesn’t mean the right to defend my home should be stripped.
420 2018-10-28 17:50:16 agree with momentum, strong finish on friday and can see that continuing this week coming, as mentioned before choosing quality stocks with revenue is all important.
421 2018-10-28 17:49:09 Stocks go down because of many selling to collect their profits, had nothing to do with anything else than how trading works.

I do not disagree with you that, if the black market still have better offers, then it will still rule. Only way to compete is to offer something better.
422 2018-10-28 17:48:46 I actually have a higher target for #Algw in 12 months but yes it is a crowded trade the same as many stocks on twitter. I suppose it depends if you see it as a trade or an investment.

Taking seriously, despite the increasing adoption (and awareness) of crypto, I believe speculators didn't leave the ecosystem at all. Speculators coexist even on mature markets like stocks...
425 2018-10-28 17:45:54 It is more important to know fundamental than technical analysis. Most stocks may worth technical but not fundamental always....

426 2018-10-28 17:44:50 If i am evaluating how good an investor I am I look at my performance picking stocks and compare it to the end X. If I can't beat the index I might as well just invest in that it's cheaper and easier and automatically diversified.
427 2018-10-28 17:44:30 Index finds passively invest in a bunch of stocks, like s&p 500, which is the top 500 stocks in the usa.
They are low cost (about 1/10th the cost of actively managed funds) and immediately give you diversification.
428 2018-10-28 17:44:18 Well that's honestly a error on people who are pulling out their stocks. When a company is doing really well people won't pull out their stocks but if they think they're gonna lose money they'll pull out. 

I'm not an expert but this should be simple knowledge.
429 2018-10-28 17:43:02 3/So, in my opinion, bump stocks in Vegas saved lives. An AR-15 was used point-blank and within ranges of 30 feet or less in the Parkland shooting. 34 shot, 17 died, 50.00% lethality rate.

So, why do rifles kill less people?

446 2018-10-28 17:26:04 The four French reactors shut down because they didn't have cooling towers built into their design, so they were putting out water multiple degrees celsius' difference back into the river systems, which threatened fish stocks. Cooling towers eliminate that problem.
447 2018-10-28 17:24:48 AR-15s are less effective at close range(mass shootings) They are semi-auto, just like pistols. Bump stocks can be replicated using a belt
448 2018-10-28 17:24:25 Less job growth than under Obama. Trump hasn't lowered the unemployment rate even 1% since he took office. If the economy is so great, why does 10% of the country own 80% of all stocks? Homes are selling. Gas and food prices are up. Along with school (& mass)shootings. Trumpcare?
449 2018-10-28 17:24:04 I’m only 25% through your book Deep Value, but so far the thesis seems to be that cheap stocks outperform, regardless of which measure. How do you reconcile that with this?

455 2018-10-28 17:17:39 Defense stocks would still probably go up more in a war than crypto. That said, I don’t think financial infrastructure would stay down long, going off of historical precedent including attacks on that infra.

I tracked a stock for 4 years before buying. I thought i got in very late but it jumped 6X post entry.

502 2018-10-28 16:39:01 I'm not against gun control laws but like any good law they need to be clear, specific, and effective. "Style" is vague and while banning bump stocks seems like a good idea, they are not that complicated- in the era of 3d printing, it's like trying to scoop water with a net.
503 2018-10-28 16:38:30 The only thing they WILL NOT blame on Trump is the strong economy, stocks, lowest unemployment since 1969for all races, lowest taxes in history, securing the border. # vote Dems out in November both the house and Senate, hell locals to
504 2018-10-28 16:36:38 The thing is politicians on the left aren’t proposing we ban all guns or the 2nd amendment. The rage on this is bc it’s a complicated issue, but we’re forever stuck in the simple part, the just do something part, wherein we can’t even improve background checks or ban bump stocks.
505 2018-10-28 16:35:58 I agree. Criminalize ownership of AR-15's, outlaw bump stocks. Limit the number of operable weapons and ammo a private citizen can purchase at one time & only a certain # that can be acquired per year.

510 2018-10-28 16:33:31 If I hear one more "expert" use "the strong economy" as a reason to buy stocks, I am going to scream. Under the theory that the stock market is a barometer, not a thermometer, ALL bear markets arrive during periods of strong economic growth.

513 2018-10-28 16:31:45 I’m not so sure about the narrative of stocks crashing and people fleeing into crypto. Would be to obvious imho, won’t happen. A stockmarket crash would be overall bearish I think.
514 2018-10-28 16:31:22 Bitches choosing cause my stocks improving
515 2018-10-28 16:29:22 I'm not super bearish, if we look back at market crash in 2008 and 2009 it was a great buying opportunity.  Made a lot of money buying my first stocks like BAC, F, WFC, then lost it do to promises of easy money in penny stocks. One right move and one wrong move.
516 2018-10-28 16:29:12 Central banks are printing debt to buy stocks and pump the markets. The next recession could be worst because it may also impact fiat currencies.

519 2018-10-28 16:27:25 Yes when they were buying stocks the USDINR ranged from 40-50 and when they started selling it well above 60 and not 74. They lost over 50% of their investments just due to currency. Gains in stocks was not even equal to bond yield in US. It’s big loss for them.

If you are worried about stocks, talk to you  401K advisor.  Making a small return is better than a loss.

528 2018-10-28 16:21:05 No, of course it doesn't sound pandantic it's just that all those people are actually dead even though the assult "style" rifle wasn't fully automatic. Sorry for missing the KEY point. Did Congress ever pass law banning bump stocks making semi to fully automatic as promised. No?

530 2018-10-28 16:20:31 Today many Wall Street Advisors are telling "long-term investors" to buy  OR hold stocks because they say in long run you are may make money (or  recover your losses).   It's like telling you to jump off the roof  because in the long-run your injuries will heal.

542 2018-10-28 16:10:04 The Obama administration failed us with not banning bump stocks. 

But don’t you think it’s suspicious that trump was calling for a bump stock ban, but then he met with the NRA and then he dropped the call for a ban?
543 2018-10-28 16:09:45 Govt didn't build these houses and add to supply. These were already in progress so came out of existing volume, and haven't increased housing stocks at all
544 2018-10-28 16:09:39 Magabomber. 2 racially killed in Kroger. 11 killed while at a synagogue.  Country divided. And the stocks have plummeted and are reset to the start of 2018. Yup-so much winning
545 2018-10-28 16:09:31 Some believe everything goes because they think It's a slippery slope.  And they want to protect themselves against criminals that do not obey gun laws.  And those things aren't legal everywhere.  Bump stocks will be banned soon.  NRA still not to blame.

572 2018-10-28 15:49:50 They are owned by the NRA....The President and Congress were ready to ban bump stocks after Vegas.  NRA comes for lunch at the WH.  Are bump stocks banned?  No. That fact is all I need to know to NEVER vote for anyone that takes NRA money, again.
573 2018-10-28 15:47:31 This is only index positions. Generally Big player has cash positions in stocks so they sell stock calls and hedge with selling index puts.
574 2018-10-28 15:46:32 It has been over a year since the Las Vegas shooting, killing 58 and injuring 851 Americans. Republicans control the House, Senate and Presidency and NOTHING has been done to outlaw Bumb stocks, which have no valid purpose. NOTHING DONE BY REPUBLICANS!

587 2018-10-28 15:39:19 They are why sensible gun laws aren’t able to be passed. Why 100 magazine clips are still legal, or bump stocks. I’m not opposed to the 2nd amendment, like most democrats. We are opposed to the 2nd amendment meaning everything goes, and that is what the NRA supports.
588 2018-10-28 15:38:08 Funny how the Stock Market has been on a 10 YEAR BULL while $btc has gone through roughly 5 market cycles (bear/bull) in the same period. Most retail investors in stocks are oblivious. Invest in the future $btc !!

609 2018-10-28 15:20:53 Another doubt: usually I have observed that many stocks have a majority of their movement in the first 15-30 mins of the market and in the last hour of the market. However, you seem to enter your trades usually after the first 30 mins. How often does the 'momentum' stop/reverse?
610 2018-10-28 15:19:45 For kind of your information in last 3 months all stocks are touching bottom especially mid and small on historical low e.g. dhfl,hdil all indax on 52 weeks low,actually u don't know nothing about economy & finance, not u all doctors.

615 2018-10-28 15:14:43 2A is very clear.  The FACT is most gun violence is caused by hand guns (.22 calibur to be precise)Bump stocks can be made with a belt. And we already have background checks. Only 33 states report. If existing gun laws were enforced, that might help.  We don't need more laws.

618 2018-10-28 15:13:21 Quite a predicament. Inflation up, housing and manufacturing down. Q3 gdp down almost a percentage point. Consumer prices up due to tariffs. Wages stagnant. Stocks predictably on a roller coaster.
619 2018-10-28 15:13:09 Can we buy or sell stocks using #cryptocurrency yet? 

Would be interesting use, plus open up another avenue for transfer of value direct from market to market 
620 2018-10-28 15:12:43 Because it is NOT correlated to stocks. 
621 2018-10-28 15:11:48 Jerry Falwell etc. They began to indoctrinate their fans. Robertson built a channel & sold "his news". All of which sold news that pushed his agenda & usually helped out his various stocks & investments. The cult formed & it is a white nationalist, radicalized membership. 3/3
622 2018-10-28 15:11:45 I want to blame the employer but then it's corporation-bashing and you sound like Che Guevara.  The buyback of stocks and the transfer of the funds directly to the wealthiest stockholders precedes a great fall.  Socialism was most popular in the US during the Great Depression.

636 2018-10-28 15:01:25 What Anne said di ko rin gamay stocks rn but im trading paunti unti tho under my dad's guidance. I wish there was a proper lesson for this that won't cost thousands lmao.

640 2018-10-28 14:59:39 I mean, that's just the nature of stocks? They go up and down daily.
641 2018-10-28 14:59:05 Especially under the circumstances. Ang aggressive ng expansion ng local companies even if down yung stocks it's more likely it'll bounce right back up. Ang bilis din tumaas ng prices ng real estate, you can make a killing in buy and sell if you can afford the initial cost.

643 2018-10-28 14:57:37 I've noticed the same. It's been a really tough year but my Portfolio has definitely been helped by the flow of Dividends. I've also noticed that many decent Divvy Stocks have tended to hold up better - could be because FTSE100 and 250 though.

648 2018-10-28 14:55:01 Yes, here we must register our "assault rifles", but we can own them.
I'm not for banning those. But who needs high-capacity magazines and bump stocks for home defense? Ten round mags are more than enough.

650 2018-10-28 14:54:06 Universal background checks. Banning bump-stocks & high capacity magazines. Closing the gun show loophole. Regulating & taxing high velocity ammunition. No civilian *needs* military style assault rifles intended only to kill mass numbers of humans.
*Common sense gun reform now.*
651 2018-10-28 14:52:56 Warren Buffett's one of quotes regarding active fund management is "we don't get paid for activity, we get paid for being right." 

As long term investor, one should focus on being right by adopting the principle of margin of safety, & knowing the intrinsic value of those stocks.
652 2018-10-28 14:52:26 The fact is, there are tons of holes in the system we have now. It’s very fragmented from state to state. Assault rifles are ridiculous in a civilian context. Period. No one needs bump stocks.

655 2018-10-28 14:50:50 I can't believe Obama took credit for the recent rise in the economy and all of the dems and libs were supportive of him.

When the stocks dropped this past week, it suddenly became President Trump's fault.

No one has provided documentation showing Obama's economic plan.

660 2018-10-28 14:46:00 I agree that weapons like the AR-15 and things like bump stocks should be banned. But something that might save more lives is free access to mental health services. If you feel supported and loved in your life, you are less likely to use violence.
661 2018-10-28 14:45:59 You two has made complete asses of yourself from the 1st check you both got from the #SHITSHOWPOTUS sit down somewhere we all know that neither one of you speak for anyone but yourselves both are laughing stocks to people of color & ya'll don't speak for anyone but tRUMP 2 fools
662 2018-10-28 14:44:36 I already said: As individual investor, my performance doesn't have to be great every year. Only solution i have to weather the storm is buy good quality stocks
663 2018-10-28 14:43:48 I would also like to see a ban on bump stocks and assault style rifles like the AR-15
664 2018-10-28 14:43:05 Existing federal gun laws dont address bump stocks since they have no moving parts. We could probably get it done but it would require Democrats to concentrate on bump stocks instead of trying to gut the 2nd amendment in bump stock legislation.

672 2018-10-28 14:37:32 More like people worried about stocks and share prices
673 2018-10-28 14:37:11 Dumb question, but how does one invest in foreign stocks not listed in the US stock exchanges or OTC market?
674 2018-10-28 14:37:01 I stand corrected about "fact". 

It's highly likely that all stocks, even superior quality ones, will go down during a "major correction" / recession. We are witnessing one right now.

677 2018-10-28 14:35:05 Employment gains are less than under Obama’s.

The Peak GDP #’s less than Obama’s. Tariffs =layoffs
678 2018-10-28 14:33:33 We need some new non biased social media platforms to replace Facebook and Twitter. A place where we wont be banned or sensored. It would be fantastic to watch their stocks tank.

682 2018-10-28 14:31:32 Yes, but that non automatic can easily be made automatic. Trump called for the banning of bump stocks and did that even occur? No. They are doing nothing to curtail the rampant gun violence in this country. No additional background checks, no trainings, or anything to stop this.
683 2018-10-28 14:31:04 “the 9/11 terror attacks shut down the U.S. stock market for four days and sparked a mini-crash of 12% in the first week that stocks resumed trading in September 2001”

690 2018-10-28 14:28:33 I think Investors do though and I've got a sense that 'Remain' Voters are much more likely to sell their Stocks because they have a predisposition to expect a Disaster. That means near 50% of Market Players will be likely to Cash out.
691 2018-10-28 14:27:24 @SenatorCollins you are partly to blame for this!!  Why can’t you/any of your GOP brethren do something about Trump’s rhetoric of hatred?

704 2018-10-28 14:17:07 FMCG stocks were relatively cheap in 2003-08 period. Maybe because it was when investors chased industrials and cyclicals.

714 2018-10-28 14:13:13 All of the foregoing presumes that we're going for a centralised effort run almost entirely by government.

726 2018-10-28 14:03:16 It says something about that bump stocks are still legal as the regulatory process rolls ever so slowly.

The president said they should be illegal. 
They are still legal.

736 2018-10-28 13:52:27 This isn’t a stock correction at all.  Everything right now is in direct response to the interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve.  They intentionally announced the rate increase prior to the election which impacted stocks. 6 rate changes under Trump, way too fast.
737 2018-10-28 13:52:10 Yes because they would totally say please take all of your money out of our stocks and invest elsewhere.  Plenty of possible investments, not a real worry that they will turn me away over one demonstrably irrational and poorly educated dirt farmer feeling insulted.

743 2018-10-28 13:46:41 Wow, “about” to outlaw bump stocks, what a radical move. How about we put armed guards in our temples? That was his response after a mass shooting. I’ll stick with my resistance to cruelty, violence and fear mongering and you stick with conspiracy theorists.
744 2018-10-28 13:42:36 You said having knowledge of the fact? I don't think anyone has idea. The problem is market may go down, but it's not certain stocks we understand will go down too. how long will they go down? It's better to buy with upside expectation, my case 15% to 20% and start deploying.
745 2018-10-28 13:41:33 I've always believed Trump's base is composed of about 35% Greedy and 65% Gullible.  We can't fix the Gullibles, but the Greedy can be easily turned.  Sell your stocks and save your country patriots.

759 2018-10-28 13:30:28 Trump and the GOP can't even do something SIMPLE like banning Bump Stocks and high-capacity magazines.
The blood of American citizens is on their hands.
760 2018-10-28 13:30:24 Letting everyone know #politics and #stocks don’t always go hand in hand. #Investors seek opportunity in the market and #breakingnews doesn’t always apply
761 2018-10-28 13:30:18 DSGE models do not ignore stocks beyond what I have already said. They certainly do not ignore time.
762 2018-10-28 13:30:15 Need to explain programmatic ads to your Mom? It's like the stock market, except ad impressions are traded instead of stocks.
763 2018-10-28 13:28:34 MFs
No one can time the market, but we bring NFOs at Peak
No one can time the market, but we launch dynamic allocation to time the Market.
No one can time the market, but we have high churn ratio to time the stocks
No one can time the market, but fund managers resign near peak
764 2018-10-28 13:27:48 That's pretty much it for a watch list. At some point market will rebound fiercely and with a good timing in a good stocks I believe some early entry points are possible. Buy keep in mind that historically after such crashes volatility remained high for weeks to go.
765 2018-10-28 13:26:54 I'm going to guess it comes down to money. Gab is being highlighted on an international stage and it's a competitor of Facebook. If people starting jumping ship a decline in FB could see reduced profits for those that own stocks in it.
766 2018-10-28 13:26:24 Fed raising rates. Stocks tanking. Trump crime family will not be tolerated after Mueller’s indictment.
767 2018-10-28 13:26:19 With growth clearly slowing, the market seems to be coming around to the view that all sugar highs end. This is one reason that U.S. stocks are on pace for their worst October since 2008.
768 2018-10-28 13:24:57 STOCKS & MIDTERMS:  Smart money and corporate executives have been  selling stocks because of the huge risk in the Midterm elections.  They  are worries how trump and his racist supporters will react.  @thomaskaine5 @DNC
769 2018-10-28 13:24:27 Currently above water but sinking fast. Luckily I have  3 sizeable winners in my concentrated PF of 11 stocks and manged to jettison a couple of losers before they became too large. Still 93% invested and continue to hold shares which I believe are good value for the long term.

772 2018-10-28 13:20:54 Depends what you are trading. Certainly not for stocks!
773 2018-10-28 13:20:51 Trading stocks on-line is so easy and cheap that 5 million investors were routinely doing it as of the end of 1998
Now?
774 2018-10-28 13:19:13 Reuters: Foreigners sold a net 2.34 billion riyals ($624 million) in the Saudi stock market in the week ending Oct. 25, but the bourse was supported by local institutions which bought 8.06 billion riyals worth of stocks, stock exchange data showed
775 2018-10-28 13:18:18 that’s a truth but it’s more general than case by case not to mention if your parents were black which I assume they were they were probably put on (via their hard work) how they could save/invest/protect their money but they market is the same. Stocks, housing, etc (cont)
776 2018-10-28 13:17:25 Absolutely. In fact i am liking the current market scenario and want it to stay like this for next 2-3 years so that i can accumulate my favourite stocks as much as i can. 
777 2018-10-28 13:16:51 The kind of bearishness i am seeing all around, seems like out of box 700-800 point rally coming soon!
And reason is i myself - i waited for stocks to correct - corrected - available 8% below my marked price and still waiting for more correction!
@Toshnilwalsunil
778 2018-10-28 13:16:45 No value investor is investing in stocks just because they have a low price to book (P/B). The only people that think value is such appear to be quants and the media. You can’t determine value on a P/E, let alone a P/B, or really any ratio, aside from price versus fair value.
779 2018-10-28 13:16:21 What I said still stands, the guy is a moron. Those bump stocks saved lives.
780 2018-10-28 13:14:58 @realDonaldTrump If you really mourn the deaths of Americans you should be working to prevent guns from getting into the hands of those who commit murders, prevent the sale of semi-automatic weapons, and make bump stocks illegal. You don't care because the NRA owns you.
781 2018-10-28 13:14:13 I asked since all I hear is people our age just buying cannabis stocks
It kind of became a "fad"
782 2018-10-28 13:13:32 I have two Colt AR-15s.
But I believe NO PRIVATE CITIZEN needs bump stocks or high-capacity magazines.
TRUMP IS A COWARD for not banning these items.
He's owned by the NRA.

786 2018-10-28 13:11:35 Just dropped my daughter at Sunday school. Kids visibly upset. Armed security (as always) plus police (special) on site. My daughter kept her phone in case of emergency.

787 2018-10-28 13:10:38 Can we sneak in a serious discussion on assault weapons and bump-stocks, remember those, between the serious discussions of Trump fueling right-wing paranoia, the attempted assassinations of half the Democratic leadership and the 2 black people murdered by a white supremacist?
788 2018-10-28 13:09:17 Did you say the same with Obama???  Who approved bump stocks? Lol wake up!
789 2018-10-28 13:09:11 A loan is debt, thus you owe money. Straight cash is straight cash do whatever you want. You dumb as fuck with your money if you can’t flip 75000. That’s a number of stocks and investments you can make on your own terms.

801 2018-10-28 12:52:00 Yeah looks like it. This gave me an idea.  I'll open a new portfolio with $500K dry powder . If we drop 25% more, I'll start buying about 50 stocks (mix of large cap value and growth) until $500 is all employed. Then wait it out.  Currently reviewing historical corrections.

812 2018-10-28 12:39:25 Shootings have been under everyone’s watch. It’s time to toughen gun laws. As of early October, it was announced that we were days away from the Ban on bump stocks. That was expected to pass this month. We need an update!!!
813 2018-10-28 12:39:23 When stocks hit new record highs consistently there eventually comes a plateau. Doesn’t mean things are not still in a better place than it was. It just means that at any given time there is a ceiling. There are only so many buyers. Do ppl suddenly by double everything?
814 2018-10-28 12:38:59 Techie are talking about 9200-9800 levels & fundus expecting market to have time correction till next general election. Fact is, nobody knows the future or bottom of market.

839 2018-10-28 12:13:13 Likely because my address lacks; "lot", "pad" or "trailer", I don't see how banning AR-15s or bump stocks and background checks are an attack on the #2a.

To Me they're efforts to regulate the militia.

But you enjoy a Sunday in the mobile estates. . .

Nobody really knows what the stocks are in China  but they’ll be importing much more within a decade as they reduce the huge support prices to farmers ( Saudi did similar with wheat - why produce in desert ?)
886 2018-10-28 11:25:22 Those are standard capacity magazines for the semiauto rifle.  I will admit bump stocks are a stupid novelty, actually reducing a firearms accuracy.  Anti-gun democrats didnt let a bill here in IL get paased that banned them though because it was written by a R.  ...

894 2018-10-28 11:11:12 Sorry, just to clarify. Only Canadian stocks seem to be reacting to the rising #Vanadium price currently. I am not recommending Canadian stocks over others. In fact, I am only invested in @BushveldMin_Ltd for Vanadium exposure. Any stock with a realistic project will do well.

896 2018-10-28 11:08:43 Yeah I have a job.  Oh, I just got shot.  Yeah my stocks went up, oh my Senator just died in a bombing.    Yea, I got a tax cut, oh the river in town is polluted.  Yea, I don’t have socialism, oh, I’m broke from getting sick.  This is America.   You call this winning?
897 2018-10-28 11:08:13 This is pretty incredible considering the epic capacity for alcohol the Icelanders’ I was at college with had. So I would image their stocks are large.
898 2018-10-28 11:05:55 I don’t like painting ALL investors with the same brush. Some r conservative, looking for safe havens. Some r highly aggressive looking for their next target and some r will to diversify in an asset with a low correlation to stocks.

1011 2018-10-28 08:47:30 If up to me very few would have guns and nobody at all would have bump stocks or high capacity magazines. But, I am fortunate to live in a democracy where the police are unarmed and gun crime is rare, because only a handful of criminals have guns (they mainly kill each other).

If u want to track big investors like WB, RJ, RK damani, etc. watch their CORE portfolio. 

Most people track their "experiments" & burn their fingers. 

Most of these investors hold their core stocks over DECADES.

1048 2018-10-28 08:09:18 Mate the stocks are almost back where they were. If you're a long then you aren't selling so you don't lose out at all..

1131 2018-10-28 06:28:46 Hi Steven, i narrow down my list of potential plays by taking out stocks that don’t fit my trading stategy, such prices above $10 and float above 100 million shares. Then i check out previous earnings and how that stock reacted prior to earning and after earnings. @DekmarTrades

1137 2018-10-28 06:25:15 Just want to take a moment to extend my deep sadness at—and thoughts and prayers for— #Pittsburgh. But that isn’t enough. I also want (1) a ban on AR15s, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks; (2) universal federal background checks;  (3) repeal of the PLCAA—and more.
1138 2018-10-28 06:24:36 That’s the best joke yet. Either no customs as @ present & Nissan with 4 hours stocks  get their steady stream of supplies or they close & 100k jobs with it.
Get real. The only people the French hate less than the Yanks for feeing them from Hitler are us for just the same reason.

Gotta do this or expect to be voted out or your stock to tank. Because we Wall Street ultra powerful actually don’t want Democracy, capitalism & free speech.
1141 2018-10-28 06:22:16 Opposite is also true. Lot of new investors had become over confident and used to mock holders of JP Associates and RCOM from 2008. Now we can see few stocks retailers hold at 800,900,1000 going towards single digit.

1148 2018-10-28 06:17:05 So am I. I cried so much yesterday morning. I saw a tweet posted by @realDonaldTrump that he wants the legal age to purchase a firearm to 21, background checks that include Mental, & ban bump stocks. If any of these pass, I'm going to get off Twitter & stop watching the news.
1149 2018-10-28 06:16:28 Omg. But Sir now stock is ex bonus from March-April. Then also yield is very good. Will look for this and such other stocks. Tks.

1151 2018-10-28 06:15:49 No need to believe you or Trump that the best is yet to come. Stocks rise. That’s what they do. Main Street gets hurt because companies do better when they keep expenses down. Salaries are expenses.
1152 2018-10-28 06:15:37 You weren't hearing me. So I said it louder.
The emolument clause does not apply to personal wealth. We don't make our pres's to take a vow of poverty.

1162 2018-10-28 06:06:53 Democrats in congress have been trying to do something about gun violence for more than a decade. Bump Stocks should have been taken care of before those poor souls were buried. You are a joke.
1163 2018-10-28 06:05:24 It's pretty pathetic that any American can legally invest in cannabis stocks, yet the production and distribution of cannabis is completely illegal in more than a dozen states. Pretty pathetic that less than 90 percent of the population believe cannabis is a fundamental right.

But 70% of the money that companies brought back into the US went (and is continuing to go) into buy backs of company stocks which is helping the companies executives and investors . . .

We must end the easy access to firearms in America.
What happened to your promises several months ago to increase the required age to buy guns, to institute universal background checks, and ban bump stocks?
What happened?
You caved to the NRA.

1174 2018-10-28 05:46:50 Under the Brady bill “assault” weapon himicide dropped but the drop in homocidws was offset my “large capacity magazines in other guns. So now we know that we should ban certain rifles, large capacity magazines and lets throw in bump stocks.

1177 2018-10-28 05:44:49 We all hate 2000 rs notes. Ask anyone! no middle class guy stocks it. It's only hawala dealers, babus ,politicians & business who does so.
1178 2018-10-28 05:43:41 That’s a fun example I guess, you will not find many money managers who keep their clients nearing retirement 100% invested in stocks. I feel 6-7% is a closer approximation accounting for diversification into bonds, precious metals, money market funds, real estate, etc.
1179 2018-10-28 05:43:34 Not a new modus operandi .
Many penny  stocks  have been manipulated in same way
1180 2018-10-28 05:42:30 Actually as with any stocks unless you’re a day trader then over the long haul those stocks are increasing. My company benefitted from the regulation cuts and the tax breaks.

Could I ask one more??
When did you see these stocks??
1212 2018-10-28 05:02:52 That’s the problem the gun ban cult has there isn’t any difference. That’s why they have names like assault weapons and ban guns w adjustable stocks or hand thingies that go up. And if jackwagon claims to have carried M16 it’s ether older that dirt or lying
1213 2018-10-28 05:00:34 His decision of imposing "Long Term Capital Gains Tax" has turned out be sentiment Spoiler for Long Term Equity Investors...

1214 2018-10-28 04:58:59 And btw....last I checked, the bump stocks are in a phase of being banned. I’m okay with it.
1215 2018-10-28 04:57:47 Bump stocks don’t make it a true automatic! I agree! Ban the bumpstock! I never said otherwise.

1229 2018-10-28 04:40:38 That's great to hear! Wouldnt it be nice if we could pass some common sense gun reform, like banning bump stocks, regulating magazine size,taking some military grade weapons off the street,so that sane gun owners like yourself wouldnt have to worry every time you're not strapped?

1234 2018-10-28 04:36:41 Never. Another very urgent reason to purge them. No one needs an AR15. Why did the @GOP work so hard to ensure mentally unstable persons can obtain guns?Why did the GOP refuse to regulate Bump Stocks, close gun show loopholes? There's no such thing as too many deaths for the GOP.

1236 2018-10-28 04:33:09 They are an investment strategy page and a very good one they do not buy or sell stocks. They are in fact large enough though they can shift the market on massive stocks.

But I certainly DO respect your opinion. And I appreciate the respectful dialogue. You guys are truly heroes.

1260 2018-10-28 04:02:01 True. Liberals stocks went up when they got rid of Toxic @TonyAbbottMHR for @TurnbullMalcolm  however they have fallen hugely since @ScottMorrisonMP took over from Turnbull. At least the ALP was trying to save skin, the Libs the second time just wanted payback ordered by Murdoch
1261 2018-10-28 04:01:01 Having all those assets on Stellar is a big deal. Being able to buy digital stable coins, stocks, bonds, etc., on Stellar's network means those with $XLM will have a wider option to buy, sell, and trade. The DEX grows 
1262 2018-10-28 04:00:47 Background checks are already mandatory unless selling as a individual to another individual. Assault weapons is so loosely used that it appears you don’t get the machine guns are illegal for private citizens unless the proper license is owned. Also No argument about bump stocks
1263 2018-10-28 03:58:53 Propaganda of the idea that anyone can pick stocks?
1264 2018-10-28 03:58:27 First, allow research to be done. Ban bump stocks, raise gun owning age to 21, national background check database, close gun show loophole,& ultimately get the AR15 out of main stream circulation. No, it won’t stop ALL the shootings but it’s a start & we gotta do more than pray.
1265 2018-10-28 03:56:00 Try mo sa FarmOn, it’s less complicated compared to stocks.

1267 2018-10-28 03:54:03 Yup. It’s a guess. Q: If stocks fall, why would people put their money into crypto?
1268 2018-10-28 03:53:37 Watch their stocks drop. Never bet against your country.
1269 2018-10-28 03:53:30 NUT UP Senator. Ban AR 15 and bump stocks, raise the age, background checks including for mental illness. #ActionNotWords

1273 2018-10-28 03:45:32 Why haven’t you banned bump stocks or raised the age to purchase a firearm to 21 like you said you would? Are you afraid of the NRA?
1274 2018-10-28 03:44:13 Did you sell cannabis stocks before they dropped?
1275 2018-10-28 03:43:54 @competitionplus I would like to see NHRA replace Pro Stocks with Pro Mods. Much more exiting racing.

You're not allowed to engage in inciting, libelous, slanderous, or secret-revealing speech. Meanwhile,we can't even agree to ban bump stocks, used to shoot 500 in 1 event.

1284 2018-10-28 03:35:33 Big week ahead for the ASX. I have picked up a lot of stocks that are backtesting key support / resistance (e.g. $OML $SFR $IAG $JBH $BKL). It needs to hold or there will be more downside risk.

1286 2018-10-28 03:34:03 .@realDonaldTrump said ATF would use its regulatory authority to ban bump stocks after hundreds were killed or wounded in Las Vegas more than a year ago (just for the record). Hasn't happened.

1293 2018-10-28 03:27:03 Thanks! I’ll check it out! But honestly, I’m not much of a shopper or consumer. I spend little money & have no real interest in acquiring material things. I plow almost everything I have in2 investments (stocks & real estate) 2 achieve financial independence/freedom.
1294 2018-10-28 03:25:13 *the Nazis disarmed Jews, and non party members, not themselves. They greatly increased ownership of guns for party members. This is a scare tactic, make people think banning bump stocks = raiding citizen homes to remove all weaponry. It’s not & practically noone wants the latter
1295 2018-10-28 03:23:56 Ready to talk bump stocks.
1296 2018-10-28 03:23:56 I'm not bootlicking. They built something. Why do they not deserve it. I work hard to grow my savings through stocks and other means to get to where I am. Have I not earned it? The entitled mentality of those pushing socialism is a real problem.
1297 2018-10-28 03:22:47 I would also like to make a point more to the stock pumpers and syndicates oporaring on social media. With the sole purpose of pumping their dog shit stocks, in coordinated campaigns with social media, and conventional marketing Chanel’s! That to me is far worse Michael!

1301 2018-10-28 03:16:56 Disappointed to say that the emergency power did *NOT* function appropriately. Luckily it was only for a short time, and we have UPSs, but the response was not stellar. Emphasizes further need for backups and LN2 stocks that do not rely on university power.
1302 2018-10-28 03:16:27 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to improve your chronic fatigue
1303 2018-10-28 03:15:22 Bump stocks are still legal?????????

1305 2018-10-28 03:11:02 "Buy stocks that are going up and sell stocks that are going down." It usually works.
1306 2018-10-28 03:10:15 I should add, that background checks do appear to be a good thing. But that is already law. But again, the assault weapon ban was useless according to the DoJ & FBI which studied this. And bump stocks? Be serious. Besides that, they will be banned soon I predict.

1318 2018-10-28 02:53:52 Funny, tech stocks plunged last week. The dirty tricks have consequences. They pissed of the people with money to invest. They can go to hell!
1319 2018-10-28 02:50:22 Stocks are highly overvalued.  All their price are much higher than their book value . Hype is gone .time to get real and see gain their balance sheet. Market is not economy.
1320 2018-10-28 02:49:58 The economy is doing way better than people think it is. Stocks are grossly oversold at the moment.
1321 2018-10-28 02:49:42 The 10 year assault rifle ban was lifted. The Dept. of Justice studied it thoroughly. It had no effect, brother. Bump stocks? Worried about bump stocks? One terrible tragedy does not a national strategy make. The background checks are already in place. What more do you ask for?
1322 2018-10-28 02:45:39 Great! Housing prices are inflated. Homes are not stocks on the stock exhange, but shelter for children, grandparents and parents.
1323 2018-10-28 02:44:05 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
1324 2018-10-28 02:42:10 Yes I do stop... I invested very little in last 15 months based on PE ratio... SIP in ppfas only bcoz only little invested by them in Indian stocks mostly cash and overseas..

1326 2018-10-28 02:41:12 I guess he truly knows a lot about stocks.
1327 2018-10-28 02:40:56 We are at crisis level and Congress is cowering. Call em back! Legislate meaningful laws to end this cycle of terrorism and death. Universal background checks, bump stocks, fix this. NRA not helping.  Even LE are getting hit by military grade weapons.
1328 2018-10-28 02:40:24 You do have to be careful because if Marth players follow how you actually fight mk, it can be extremely annoying to put Marth in the situations needed to win, and/or without putting your stocks at risk for taking a chance in neutral vs Lucina.  (Cross up roll options < fsmash)
1329 2018-10-28 02:39:28 Broader market has corrected more than the index stocks...so isn't it good time to buy the stocks...?
1330 2018-10-28 02:39:10 How about offering sensible gun safety legislation. You know, like closing loopholes for background checks, required training with testing and licensing (like drivers licenses), no bump stocks, no large capacity weapons, and no NRA campaign $
1331 2018-10-28 02:38:02 We have the fastest growing GDP, more job, growing stocks and 401k and envy of the world on economy Why cant you people be happy for American and your own self this means great news for all of us
1332 2018-10-28 02:36:08 The Amendment makes no mention of automatic weapons, weapons of war, army assault rifles, magazine clip capacity or bump stocks. Where does it end? Gun nuts will remain gun nuts until limits are put in place. Have a gun if you must, not a weapon of war!

1338 2018-10-28 02:30:19 Bhai... sharp pull back is anticipated but may b short lived. Koi sarkar nahi chalegi.. It is a mega distribution pattern in stocks born years ago out of machine driven strategies.. may end only with 2008 like crash before process of recreation begins & global debt/GDP readjust
1339 2018-10-28 02:30:16 Soros has a way in dealing with stocks, especially in US market. To some extent, he still retains some covert power. The Chief could have listened to what he said before sitting in Oval Office. Never mind, now he is very old, not that sharp or witty anymore. So...

1342 2018-10-28 02:27:30 I sincerely hope your first order of business is to speak with Gov Evers and get rid of bump stocks as well as reinstating a cooling off period for gun ownership.
1343 2018-10-28 02:27:26 Stocks just had the biggest drop in 8 years, companies aren’t rcv’g financing which drops the GDP, inflation rising which puts wages into the negative, tariffs have made others countries put tariffs right back at us, we lost the 12B soy market and have to pay the farmers—hello?
1344 2018-10-28 02:27:15 Since icici bank gave gold results i thought bank nifty may go up which in turn might impact this stock. Till now i have been connecting stocks like this. Will correct myself. Thank you sir.

1347 2018-10-28 02:24:06 Obama had the stocks up also. In fact Trumps job rates are down in a lot of months. He's done nothing but made the rich richer. He's the stupiest idiot of his brainwashed cult. The killings today were bc of his rhetoric. The shooter believed what DT said about them coming here.
1348 2018-10-28 02:23:34 Have you shit-stains banned bump stocks yet? I didn’t think so.

1370 2018-10-28 02:03:12 clearly the only solution, be sure to buy gun stocks and tip your lobbyists
1371 2018-10-28 02:02:47 How is it you guys are always right, never make a mistake, never harm a soul, yet the stocks of oil and gas companies are in the tank and stockholders are suing?
1372 2018-10-28 02:02:19 Years of “thoughts and prayers” and inaction on your part. Common sense gun laws are of no concern to you.

5:13 AM - 22 Feb 2018
1382 2018-10-28 01:51:38 You could always do that. You are just willing to sell out your fellow Americans freedoms to save a few bucks. How bad will the tech companies and stocks suffer. Will it be worth it? Only time will tell. Good talk.
1383 2018-10-28 01:51:29 @Nodrog1 true, a lot of hype is what makes these jump! That’s why there penny stocks! People buy in from the hype and it’s a history Run.
1384 2018-10-28 01:48:36 Universal background checks, loop holes, bump stocks, no need for high powered weapons like AR-15 being sold easily to anyone. Mass shootings are typically done by people with no criminal histories and probably no easy for them to find them on the street. They aren’t in gangs

next week a lobster shop is opening in lower Manhattan.

1386 2018-10-28 01:46:40 I believe he banned bump stocks. Raising the age to 21 is being challenged in the courts now. Do you know anything about mental health and how you can check into it with a background check? It's impossible, but you people don't seem to know that. I wish it was easy.
1387 2018-10-28 01:45:55 I did read your complaints which is why I replied. I am not saying you don't have valid points. As you said the company is "clueless" but yet their stocks have gone up the last 3 quarters and S.A. is offering them over 100 million to put on one show.

1390 2018-10-28 01:43:11 Article Below: In fact, with Manhattan in lockdown after the collapse of the WTC twin towers, the NYSE and the Nasdaq exchanges were closed until Monday, Sept 17, the longest shutdown since 1933. When markets reopened, U.S. stocks suffered several days of steep losses.

1392 2018-10-28 01:37:47 and you think banning bump stocks but not AK-47's will end the carnage. You really are working overtime to protect that #NRA "A" Rating. Crocodile Tears, Susan. Crocodile Tears. #FipThe5th
1393 2018-10-28 01:36:16 We don't buy auto company stocks to make money,  we invest in them for brute force, since they impact so many other industries and suppliers. 

Interestingly, airlines are the ones flying the friendly skies and making profits.

1400 2018-10-28 01:24:50 It's deliberately set up to put people in debt. That's how stocks/shares make money. The more debt there is the more money the Gov't makes from the system. That's why they mention crisis loans so much. The more loans there are the more money they make on those too.

1404 2018-10-28 01:19:53 NOthing is perfect at first. It takes time. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Enforce vaulting of guns. Registering and background checks. Make it harder for criminals.

1412 2018-10-28 01:06:23 No Democrat is suggesting banning guns but there's literally no need for bump stocks or extended clips. You don't need 20 rounds for ANY reason.
1413 2018-10-28 01:05:32 No. A Democratic society should feel free to go about their business without fear. Martial law contradicts that.  Stricter him laws refers to universal background checks and banning of weapons of war like extended clips and bump stocks.
1414 2018-10-28 01:04:40 After seeing the same stories over and over, where stocks under Trump keep reaching record highs and every time he does something horrendously evil, stocks either go up or are unaffected, I’ve come to the conclusion that the stock market is fucking shit.
1415 2018-10-28 01:03:24 I'd say a global recession is much more harmful than a possible bubble in specific asset classes, esp stocks, where volatility/risk part of the deal.
1416 2018-10-28 01:03:16 Bump stocks are only for fun, if the Vegas shooter used one it likely SAVED lives, that is how inaccurate they make the gun.  For real.  Bump stocks aren't illegal, they meet the requirements and banning them would be absurd because you can get the same effect using a damn belt.
1417 2018-10-28 01:02:29 I'm a veteran. I don't hate guns. I don't want to take away the second amendment right, I just think we need more common sense laws. 

Why do we need high capacity magazines and bump stocks for hunting and protection? When was the last time you fired fifteen rounds into a buck?
1418 2018-10-28 01:00:45 Can they use DDGs . that they are producing with there rotten corn government stocks?

1420 2018-10-28 00:54:01 Thoughts n prayers. How about some sensible gun reform. How about ban bump stocks how about universal background checks. How about no NRA money. The usual GOP response thoughts n prayers.
1421 2018-10-28 00:53:26 Not the case.  We have gun regulations on the books today. I am a Republican and I support background checks.I'm not sure what ur talking about. Trump wants to get rid of ?bump stocks?  I don't know much about the auto, semi auto, hi velocity rounds issues to discuss it today.
1422 2018-10-28 00:52:54 so SWS tagged yo dumb ass in a question he asked me. And dude you and all those other sambos are laughing stocks right now.
1423 2018-10-28 00:52:47 Fkn trade this market. You need screen time. You need paper cuts. You need frustration. You need little wins and never ending grinding.

1424 2018-10-28 00:52:40 No it’s not. Very few people could replicate full auto rate of fire with a semi auto. Bump fire stocks may get you close, but they’re also complete pieces of shit that will ruin your accuracy.
1425 2018-10-28 00:49:10 Allow federal funding to study gun violence and safety. Outlaw bump stocks. Close gun show and on-line loop holes. Ban military type assault weapons. I grew up in s home with hunting rifles and shotguns so I know how to respect the right/responsibility of a firearm.

1429 2018-10-28 00:42:03 Stop with all the Nazi talk.
The problem is Trump's unwillingness to take simple steps like banning bump stocks and high capacity magazines.
Simple!!!!
1430 2018-10-28 00:40:23 It's  all fun! I always have my money working for me! Stocks,Cryptocurrencies  and sports bets! If the money is all in the bank they are making the money on you

1435 2018-10-28 00:39:16 Stock buy backs are expected to exceed $1 trillion dollars for 2018.

Allowing big companies to artifally make their stocks look in demand. When really investors are drying up.

Just look back in time and you’ll see what I’m talking about.

1436 2018-10-28 00:38:16 Yeah increased jobs, fair trade, growing stocks, and people with more $ is a real mess! Open your eyes!
1437 2018-10-28 00:36:31 WE can do the praying Sean, YOU are actually in a position to DO something about the senseless violence in America - Las Vegas was over a YEAR ago, have you even moved on a no-brainer like outlawing bump stocks?  every cop EVER killed in the line of duty has been TRAINED & ARMED!
1438 2018-10-28 00:36:20 Another HORRENDOUS shooting & killing. All I ask
from NRA,PRESIDENT & (HUNTERS, kill for meat to feed families), reasonable gun control,ban bump stocks,
ban assault rifles except for Military & law officers.
Safety classes who teach knowing ur gun, gun laws & practice w/shooting!
1439 2018-10-28 00:36:14 I agree on no bump stocks, a shotgun is just as lethal as an AR so the risk factor thing is ridiculous. What mental health factors should be added? So if somebody takes meds to stay asleep they should be banned?
1440 2018-10-28 00:34:01 @MatthewStadlen I think the government should double down on austerity and bring back the stocks.. only joking 
1441 2018-10-28 00:31:51 Where did you come from, Victor with no picture? You can’t even put a picture up? Your stocks should still be up a little, going by the overall market. And yeah, I like that Iran and NKorea don’t threaten us anymore, and that SOMEONE tries to balance our trade def.
1442 2018-10-28 00:31:37 Very few people.  I'd prefer to use an advisor who would make general recommendations and not specific funds/stocks.
1443 2018-10-28 00:30:07 The pullback in the last few weeks was due to fear of Dems gaining the House. If Repubs keep both chambers, stocks will soar.
1444 2018-10-28 00:26:09 I've wondered if it was a profitable strategy to buy straddles (sell the losing leg when it moves) when stocks have higher implied moves for earnings.

1452 2018-10-28 00:22:21 Anyone with access to YouTube can find vids of AR owners showing off their rates of fire. They do this to show that outlawing bump stocks is foolish.
1453 2018-10-28 00:20:26 If the GOP can't even ban simple things like bump stocks and high capacity magazines, they MUST be removed from office.
1454 2018-10-28 00:19:31 running false negative ads isn’t a good campaign strategy! What are you doing for healthcare? Why are you against pre-existing conditions? What about sensible gun legislation and bump stocks and universal background checks and Your A rating from NRA?

1456 2018-10-28 00:16:56 (An AR-15 should, for instance, require more scrutiny than does a manual-breech-load 12-gauge shotgun.)

I don't think that modifications and accessories allowing high semi-auto rates of fire - e.g. high-capacity magazines, bump-stocks, etc. - should be available.
1457 2018-10-28 00:16:15 hey Mitch!   it's been over A YEAR since one man killed and wounded over 600 human beings in under 9 minutes from over 1,200 feet away and 32 stories up!    have YOU and the GOP even moved on a no-brainer like banning BUMP STOCKS???  of COURSE you haven't!  hypocrite!

3. Many stocks are available at cheap valuations and are at major support levels.
4. Huge short period are pending in the System.

1504 2018-10-27 23:41:45 I love that Winco stocks baby food, insect killer and motor oil on the same aisle
1505 2018-10-27 23:41:40 We will have to after Trump. He took a great country and dragged it into the gutter. We would be the laughing stocks of the world if it weren’t for our military might, especially in the hands of a megalomaniac. Now he is selling us out to Putin. Yes Great.
1506 2018-10-27 23:41:20 @Morrisons Given the differences between the two, does the website relate to your local store, whilst the app relates to your distribution centre?  The app relates to previous orders, whereas the website ignores what your local store actually stocks.
1507 2018-10-27 23:40:42 OPTION for those with 401K:  About half of 401K plans offer "stable  value funds" (similar to a money market) yielding between 1.5% and 2.4%,  roughly, net of fees.   If you are worried about stocks, talk to you  401K advisor.  Making a small return is better than a loss.

1509 2018-10-27 23:39:32 I really appreciate it.

I'd run it, but I don't have all 506 stocks in a single spreadsheet with daily data.

Bummer.
1510 2018-10-27 23:38:40  Better sell your stocks in Campbell now ...
1511 2018-10-27 23:38:37 Eventually, they will rescue stocks, and every other asset class, but only after they foolishly cause the next crisis.   The ratio of base money to commercial bank debt money needs to be completely reset.  The fed will print money, and retirees will get their benefits cut.
1512 2018-10-27 23:37:57 Have you considered modifications to any of the gun laws? How are you coming on the law that bans bump-stocks?  Can you move the gun violence issue higher on your priority list?
1513 2018-10-27 23:37:29 No the stock market is at an all time high. Do you own stocks? The stock market is not the economy which is what the trump regime would like you to think. Corporate tax cuts will not help you unless you are in the top 1%.
1514 2018-10-27 23:36:34 No can do!  I’m sure you just need some poor fool to go in the stocks all day!  the folklore stuff sounds cool, hope it’s gone well and good luck tomorrow!
1515 2018-10-27 23:36:11 Ha ,It will go through. There is quite rigorous support for it in BC. Harper and Clark, sidestepped to many regulations with the NEB.There is a lot of solid research done but we have always been concerned about how it will affect the Oceans,fish stocks Whales,and our 1st Nations.
1516 2018-10-27 23:33:41 I rarely tweet about stocks. But $DIGAF is prepped for a big run. $BTC still bullish as ever, $XRP long heavy.  DIGAF is involved in crypto so its safe to say once #bitcoin gets moving so will DIGAF
1517 2018-10-27 23:32:37 Not Trump’s fault. This was set in motion with eight years of near zero interest rates. Now we have trillion dollar debt bubble, student loan bubble, corporate debt bubble and a renewed housing bubble. Be smart, buy gold. And silver. The next year in stocks will be wild!
1518 2018-10-27 23:31:32 #synagogueshooting " but we need more than thoughts and prayers. As a country, we need to stand up to the gun lobby and to bigotry. Congress and the Trump administration still haven’t banned bump stocks, or made background checks universal before buying firearms." @NickKristof

1520 2018-10-27 23:30:26 This was YOU on 2-22-18: I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks!  Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue.  YOU DID NOTHING!!!!
1521 2018-10-27 23:29:27 These are the things that send me to the cupboards checking to make sure my pre CW2 stocks are not diminished.
1522 2018-10-27 23:28:52 Doubling the economy???? Global tech stocks just lost over a billion dollars yesterday over concerns with the trade war he started. 401K interest rates also don’t double or everyone would have one. Try reading a book or two.
1523 2018-10-27 23:28:49 Well betting short on the market, then 1% simply makes it happen by simply selling all their stocks into bonds, hold on the cash they will need to buy up your house, now reduced in value, buy up public infrastructure, cause states will be needing cash, then get a tax break too
1524 2018-10-27 23:27:35 If you are in a position where you can't liquidate investments, agree, but stocks can be sold in an instant 
1525 2018-10-27 23:25:59 WHEN DID YOU START INVESTING IN STOCKS (personally OR professionally; whichever was first)?

1530 2018-10-27 23:21:02 If you guys don’t know what’s happening it’s that investors probably decided to take their profits while they could because they didn’t want the China-US trade war to effect it. BTS has nothing to do with the stocks failing

1532 2018-10-27 23:18:45 GOP go to thoughts n prayers. How about some some common sense gun laws. What happen to banning bump stocks
1533 2018-10-27 23:18:44 Ban AR and bump stocks now!!
1534 2018-10-27 23:15:50 Let's start with outlawing auto and semi automatic weapons. Plastic guns, bump stocks and silencers. Dont give me the NRA line. These items can all, and have led to mass murder. Its NOT a violation of the 2nd amendment. They can keep the rest of their guns
1535 2018-10-27 23:15:33 Your link is broken. 

Don’t you think it’s odd the trump was very anti-bump stocks, then he had a private sit down meeting with the NRA, then all talk of banning bump stocks disappeared???
1536 2018-10-27 23:14:46 Anyone on here use Robinhood for trading and stocks?
1537 2018-10-27 23:14:21 He used an AR15 with a 
bump stock.
Didn't Trump promise to ban bump stocks. 
Promises NOT kept

1539 2018-10-27 23:14:16 No hypothesis! First hand experience matters. With corp. fam. farms like mine, stocks (think shares) can be held by family members. These "studies" don't analyze individual stocks holdings to deceipher which own farmland, buildings, equipment; from any other wall street stock.
1540 2018-10-27 23:13:56 Today many Wall Street Advisors are telling "long-term investors" to buy OR hold stocks because they say in long run you are may make money (or recover your losses).   It's like telling you to jump off the roof because in the long-run your injuries will heal.  @thomaskaine5
1541 2018-10-27 23:13:15 If I only focus on stocks and trading it is great.  I find myself getting sucked into dumb encounters which is my fault.
1542 2018-10-27 23:13:06 Suddenly the stocks are rising
1543 2018-10-27 23:11:23 Nice spin
Stocks are unstable and the rest of the world is clearly seeing how dangerous Trump is .
The Oval Office is no place for a reality TV personality with dementia .
1544 2018-10-27 23:09:50 Fixing the hate in America will be a never ending battle. Fixing the access to high powered assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines could be a battle that is won as soon as our politicians wake up.
1545 2018-10-27 23:07:05 not sure why I'm seeing more talk about BTC and cyrpto but we may see a new beginning in this pace again just like pot stocks got life again...i'm dipping my toes in

1549 2018-10-27 23:05:55 Yes.  His admin approved bump stocks for retail sale without any background check or permit.
1550 2018-10-27 23:05:30 AR15’s are the same cal as a small game hunting rifle. The only difference is that the ones you see in sporting goods stores have stocks of wood, AR’s have those scary looking cosmetics that make ppl like you think it’s something Rambo would use.

1557 2018-10-27 22:59:00 Your also wrong - The terror attacks shut down the U.S. stock market for four days and sparked a mini-crash of 12% in the first week that stocks resumed trading in September 2001. Other markets were still trading.
1558 2018-10-27 22:58:47 Yep. Impossible to LEAVE the stocks
1559 2018-10-27 22:55:57 Both job growth and stocks have been on upward trends for years now. Just curious, if “governments dont create jobs” how did trump as he said in his first six months “create” a million jobs again?
1560 2018-10-27 22:54:54 Is prefer the stocks for few days or weeks.
1561 2018-10-27 22:51:21 You’re very dense and I’m done. 

The point is stocks don’t earn daily interest. Cash goes into an interest bearing account and then it will earn interest. Whenever the depositor wants his cash back he can withdraw it, wire it, spend it, whatever. You’re making stupid arguments.
1562 2018-10-27 22:50:57 @AppleMusic where is the “New from my artist” category?!?!...if you’re wondering why stocks are down? Here’s the answer!
1563 2018-10-27 22:49:42 Hoping things work out, frankly people buying any firearms should be given LE training and basic test by LE. Pistols should be very restricted and not carried, rifles, no detachable stocks, mags over 20rds, and a port cover. However, right now...maybe civilians  #GunControlNow
1564 2018-10-27 22:49:20 No “expert” is forecasting a gain of any kind from Brexit except laughing stocks like Patrick Minford and Andrew Lillico whose ideology outweighs their intellect.
1565 2018-10-27 22:48:42 But we should try and stop people from having AR15 with bump stocks no one should have the capacity to kill hundreds of people in a few seconds
1566 2018-10-27 22:48:12 Uh lip service is one thing,  actually making it happen is another.  How many lobby dollars you think they've spent on banning bump stocks?  Apparently ACTUALLY SEEING what is going on isn't a big goal for you,  comrade.
1567 2018-10-27 22:44:00 Mark Meadows opposes any common sense reforms to curb gun violence.  Stronger background checks?  End the gun show loophole? Limit bump stocks or magazine size?  Nope.  So Mark, quit your fake empathy, given that you’re unwilling to do anything to address the problem.
1568 2018-10-27 22:43:49 1000% true we loose this tons of ppl will flee. Abandon property + cash out stocks. The market will crash. So you know we will be political prisoners then. No pressure here.

1572 2018-10-27 22:40:58 I love this old Mark Twain quote: 

"October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February."
1573 2018-10-27 22:40:41 If we make Colt get off of its ass and control the AR-15 line, shooters will look for any other 5.56 assault rifle to replace it.

They're all just as customizable, can fit extended clips, have bump stocks, bipods, suppressors, etc.

We need to ban public carry of any rifle.
1574 2018-10-27 22:39:38 In the last bullmarket, $BTC has seen a growth of ~12.800%, $ETH of 22.500%.

People called it ridiculous and a tulip bubble.

In the past years, growth:
Apple: 23.500%
Amazon: 36.500%
Nvidia: 5.000%
Adobe: 3.500%

However, that's just normal obviously.

1577 2018-10-27 22:35:51 Yep. That’s essentially what we’ll be doing. 

Depending on our assessment of the housing market and interest rate movements, I may nibble a bit on stocks as they sell off.  But I might just play it very safe and not jeopardize any of our down payment funds.
1578 2018-10-27 22:35:46 Only reason I can see the age limit to 21 is because military is trained like crazy to handle firearms. But with that you should be able to buy at 18 with military ID. Getting rid of bump stocks i am fine with.
1579 2018-10-27 22:35:37 Full semi-automatic AR-15s with bump stocks and bullet buttons and unlimited ammunition magazines.
1580 2018-10-27 22:35:20 I’m not looking for guns to be banned. I realize some need them for protection. I know hunting is a way of life for many. But what’s wrong with 21 being the minimum age? Or banning military grade weapons? Outlawing bump stocks? Why does the NRA oppose even small restrictions?
1581 2018-10-27 22:35:04 Wow--that is just low by Trump. NYSE didn't open till 9/17, and a market crash occurred afterwards, with stocks dropping 7% in one day.
1582 2018-10-27 22:32:11 Jesus christ I know my weapons. I am a gun owner. I don't believe anything with that capacity should be legal. No bump stocks, extended magazines, or any weapon that is only meant for human carnage. My point was you can't get illegal weapons without someone "legal" first. Asshat
1583 2018-10-27 22:30:53 Ban the ARs, ban large magazines, ban bump stocks, do deeper checks, have yearly check ins, have gun ownership license where you have to take a course just like a driver’s license. And probably others that are implemented around the world that I can’t think of right now.
1584 2018-10-27 22:30:40 ...... you do realize that there are many reasonable restrictions that don't involve banning all guns? right? gun registry. bullet taxes. regulations of guns used for mass shootings. ban on bump stocks. there are many things you can do that aren't banning all guns
1585 2018-10-27 22:30:29 Angela Stocks you can get up in the early hours to turn the clocks back
1586 2018-10-27 22:30:19 I couldn’t have said it better. With stocks & bonds in the US priced to deliver around 4%, the risk is low future returns (with higher VOL).

Mind you every asset class (RE, PE, private credit) carries risk: volatility, permanent loss of capital, risk of low returns, etc.
1587 2018-10-27 22:28:43 All the stocks I want to buy are expensive
1588 2018-10-27 22:27:25 I feel for Pittsb too but @GOP fails at natsec, controlling guns/assault weapons/giant magazines/bump stocks & universal background checks. @Democrats @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats calls for commonsense gun laws for yrs but NRA rules GOP. Any of US can be a victim anywhere anytime
1589 2018-10-27 22:26:03 "When you see the dollar going up along with gold... at the same time and even on days when the stock market was crashing the gold stocks were rising. They were very strong and that argues for a more of a long-term approach to the gold buying." @Brien_Lundin
1590 2018-10-27 22:21:24 You have now jumped from AR 15s to bump stocks? Bump stocks go on semi auto rifles, which there are many of. So why start with AR 15?
1591 2018-10-27 22:21:23 so he is taking on the drop in stocks because he says he owns the recovery?  After all he didn't build that.
1592 2018-10-27 22:21:02 2 years ago I have a choice between $25 fila or  a $250 Jordan's. I purchase the $25 fila, donate $30 to my favorite charity and purchase purchase $195 worth of Nike stocks. Best decision ever..
1593 2018-10-27 22:19:50 Apartheid began to crumble when UC Berkeley stopped investing in South Africa! I don’t have a portfolio but does my bank invest in NRA ? My school? We CAN divest NRA INTO PENNY STOCKS.
1594 2018-10-27 22:19:31 Great stuff. Here’s my take: Individuals hate to see their portfolio stay stagnant if stocks are increasing. Therefore, Marks strategy doesn’t work for most people. BUT, doesn’t make him wrong. If patient his strategy may outperform buy/hold passive investing...
1595 2018-10-27 22:19:05 We don’t need to ban a rifle, we need to ban magazines larger than ten rounds, bump stocks, and all the other additional devices that turn them from a day at the range to murdering a roomful of people without reloading.
1596 2018-10-27 22:18:56 Not “completely legal”. The trump admin is effectively working on banning bump stocks altogether, and many states already have bans on them. Not exactly making them Fully Auto either, still only as fast as one can pull the trigger.
1597 2018-10-27 22:18:35 Yet, imagine if kids, teachers, nuns, clubbers and dancers and concert goers, and toddlers and pacifists and you and I all had guns: it would make worth it buying gun companies’ stocks.
And it would reduce the National Debt. Bigly.
I am disheartened, don’t mind me.
1598 2018-10-27 22:18:32 Don't get me wrong I love Pro Stocks, but there are so many more Pro mods out there it would be good racing.
1599 2018-10-27 22:16:39 I thought you might say that.

By "effects of trade war tariffs" do you mean Chinese dumping stocks  prior to the midterms to try and harm President Trump because he is such  a tough negotiator?
1600 2018-10-27 22:16:10 Buy penny stocks, but don't put all your pennies in one jar!  Invest a dime bag, lady!!!
1601 2018-10-27 22:16:06 I respectfully disagree. It is to pressure public and private retirement plans to divest from gun stocks. Also to them excercise their shareholder rights to pressure them to stop making assault style rifles and high capacity magazines. (1/2)
1602 2018-10-27 22:16:05 Promod needs to take the place of Pro Stocks.
1603 2018-10-27 22:16:03 I think that is a great point. It's probably more dangerous long-term for students to have invested when everything was rising. "Trading stocks is easy" is an idea destined for trouble.
1604 2018-10-27 22:15:42 @DiMartinoBooth Since I have started researching stocks for investment I keep coming across a few who say it is time to buy gold and silver. Printed money across the world will devalue, soon. What is your opinions.
1605 2018-10-27 22:14:29 What other stocks do you like? 

Do you only buy if the CEO owns a rocket company? 

What other crimes beyond securities fraud are OK if you own a rocker company?
1606 2018-10-27 22:13:39 apple stocks rise by 35%.
1607 2018-10-27 22:10:49 Evidently all the best stocks to buy circa 1907 were railroad stocks.

1617 2018-10-27 22:00:33 What is your position on making assault weapons illegal, banning bump stocks ,creating comprehensive background checks, taking weapons from anyone with mental illness or anyone on the do not fly list?

1622 2018-10-27 21:52:57 Ok no more MAGATS tweeting at me! AR15 is a military weapon! Go fkn Google it! When Colt sold it to US Army it was used in VIETNAM! Now its semi automatic but oh no there are BUMP STOCKS that guess what... MAKE IT FULLY AUTOMATIC!
OF COURSE PUSSY HUNTERS

1624 2018-10-27 21:52:31 The employment to population ratio of prime age workers has been steadily increasing since 2010.  Stocks have been rising steadily since March 2009. Poverty was at it peak in 2010 and been declining since. 
Trump is benefiting off a great economy Obama provided him.

1625 2018-10-27 21:52:02 Good point re improving pf quality & dividend return John, great opportunity to pick up some more modestly rated progressive divi stocks with growth potential
1626 2018-10-27 21:51:18 The Fed is responsible for preventing inflation from taking hold and trying to get the economy to full employment. It is not charged with having to bail out people who speculate in the stock market. Unfortunately when stocks crash, it hurts people with 401K's who know little
1627 2018-10-27 21:50:34 Everything my husband and I were able to save all our lives is tied up in stocks and bonds.
1628 2018-10-27 21:50:25 Sounds good. When are you going to ban bump stocks like you promised right after the Vegas shooting?
1629 2018-10-27 21:50:20 Does anyone get the feeling that some of the $15 Trillion that have exited global stocks since Jan 2018 will be put into cryptos? #Bitcoin #StockMarket @iamjosephyoung @APompliano @rallyqt @bensemchee
1630 2018-10-27 21:47:28 I sure have not. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Come up with some way to keep persons with emotional problems from purchasing those weapons. Strengthen background checks!  Enogj is aenough!!!
1631 2018-10-27 21:46:44 The opposition to the Maga agenda.
People that will be stripped of their wealth under executive order from December 21st 2017..
Most of the MSM.
Tech Industries, entertainment..
The ones who's stocks are crashing...
1632 2018-10-27 21:46:25 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to treat your ADHD
1633 2018-10-27 21:45:32 Was obama reason for stocks  sell@off last week?
1634 2018-10-27 21:44:56 I predict that as long as CRAZY people have almost unlimited access to assault weapons like the AR-15; then crazy mass shootings will continue!  Time for some background checks and gun control, including an outright ban on assault weapons and bump stocks!
1635 2018-10-27 21:44:50 Reminder ProTip: Now that we're in cold weather season, don't throw away your cheese rinds. Toss them in soups and stocks for added greatness.
1636 2018-10-27 21:44:23 How are your stocks doing genius? A lot better than when the greatest President ever was in office! How is the unemployment rate?
1637 2018-10-27 21:44:05 If your investing money into a scam like 401k

Instead of Blockchain Technology.

I honestly dont even know what to say.

Clearly you dont even realize how much more money youll make in blockchain than traditional stocks.
1638 2018-10-27 21:43:50 You are loser, yes.  But speak for yourself.  Meanwhile, my stocks are doing great, conservatives in the courts, ISIS getting throttled, regulations cut back, military actually cared for, and the FBI exposed. Never would have been if she won!

1641 2018-10-27 21:39:22 Hi Jon. What did your hero Obama do after the 2014 Jewish center shooting ???? Have you read the president's statement on October 2nd regarding bump stocks ??? No. Thought not. Tweet your trump bashing if it makes you feel better
1642 2018-10-27 21:38:24 Thank you for your help.
I have some stocks in my hand
this picture is all .
I don't have all,but some are available!
1643 2018-10-27 21:36:15 There were no bump stocks in Parkland.
1644 2018-10-27 21:36:11 @SEC_News Investigate robinhood exchange. They manipulate trade contracts and limit orders will sit for days and never sell. Also their buying prices are always far higher than the actual stock price and the sell price is far lower than stocks current price.
1645 2018-10-27 21:35:50 Must be affecting his pharmaceutical stocks
1646 2018-10-27 21:35:29 He's talking about bump stocks.
1647 2018-10-27 21:34:58 If you're talking bump stocks let's discuss Vegas and parkland
1648 2018-10-27 21:33:03 Too young to read between the lines?? You need me to draw you a picture? Stocks up 40% since Jan.2017!  Recent sell off is natural.
1649 2018-10-27 21:32:47 Buddy us libtards hug trees not gun stocks . Ha
1650 2018-10-27 21:32:45 You know Obama did nothing to stop any shootings.  He actually allowed bump stocks to become legal.  More shootings were done under his watch.  

Obama divided this country with his disdain for law enforcement and jumping to conclusion nearly every time.  Never waited for facts.
1651 2018-10-27 21:30:57 Yes might be a rough ol' week out there next week. All I'm thinking tomorrow is possibly catching some bounce trades from initial oversold stocks. Not big money trades though. It is amazing how a kiss on the sore works for kids though!
1652 2018-10-27 21:30:57 By "effects of trade war tariffs" do you mean Chinese dumping stocks prior to the midterms to try and harm President Trump because he is such a tough negotiator?  Also, there are some great stock buying opportunities Monday, buy low, sell high.
1653 2018-10-27 21:30:44 I have been using mods for that but not that mod is not supported. The Sims 4 needs a full banking system with interest warning accounts, IRAs,  investments in bonds and stocks. And maybe a loan too!! I have been wanting all this since Sims 1
1654 2018-10-27 21:30:03 you asked for an explanation, the one I gave fit. I remember being told how it couldn't be bump stocks after the Vegas shooting and how that wasn't possible either.
1655 2018-10-27 21:28:46 Out of 35 global equity country indices, just 1 is up ytd (Norway).
-27 are down over 10%
-7 are down over 20%
-1 (S. Africa) is down over 30%

We're already in a global bear market, folks. Ok, the U.S. is only down 1.1% (so far). But 84% of U.S. stocks are in downtrends.
1656 2018-10-27 21:27:17 I didn’t know what bump stocks were until your vid (we don’t have access to firearms really in the uk, not a free country here) and I was shocked by how easy they are to fit, how cheap they are to buy and how effective they are in converting a semi auto to an auto. Good work
1657 2018-10-27 21:27:14 Eh. With that thinking the best investments are the most volatile. Bonds are an essential part of a portfolio to manage risk. If you are 22? Yolo small cap stocks all the way. Of you are 32? Throw some bonds on the fire homie. At 62- mucho bonds.

1660 2018-10-27 21:22:44 Now I know why my stocks have lost $30,000...lol
1661 2018-10-27 21:22:30 "Overall, global stocks have now fallen for five weeks in a row, & during that time more than 8t dollars in global wealth has been wiped out.  That is the fastest plunge in global stock market wealth since the collapse of Lehman Brothers."
1662 2018-10-27 21:22:00 My mom just asked me how I know what stocks are?????
1663 2018-10-27 21:21:50 Trump tweet from this year: I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
1664 2018-10-27 21:21:37 I wonder if there’s a better middle ground than defaulting to all notifications on. The notification customization is powerful but the overwhelm (along with lots of stocks being on watch list by default), pushes me to turn off all notifications when some might be very useful.
1665 2018-10-27 21:20:35 For longer term divi plays, I’m trying to avoid domestic stocks such as LLOY and diversify with some overseas earnings. Post Brexit, I would be looking to add some of these. Think GCP still look good at these levels, yielding c6% still I think?
1666 2018-10-27 21:20:30 Noah is an arae who trades stocks as a day job.
1667 2018-10-27 21:19:04 WHY DID TRUMP never ban bump-stocks or high-capacity magazines as he promised.
BLOOD IS ON HIS HANDS.
1668 2018-10-27 21:18:55 We could ban bump stocks, to start. But like, actually ban them. Just not say we’re going to and then do nothing to follow through with it.
1669 2018-10-27 21:17:18 As usual R’s give their fake ‘thoughts & prayers’. If they really thought abt it they’d outlaw AR-15’s. These are weapons of war & have no place in society. They’d also ban mags over 12 rounds, bump stocks, close gun show loopholes & make universal background checks standard
1670 2018-10-27 21:17:17 How do you know when to sell stocks like this that are climbing?
1671 2018-10-27 21:16:36 Ok but we don't know that people would still make them and use them in mass shootings. All the ones used in mass shootings this year have been bought. Ban AR-15s and bump stocks and let's see what happens. If nothing changes petition to reverse the law. There's 0 harm in trying.
1672 2018-10-27 21:15:25 Everyone has mental health issues lmao wtf is this gonna do. But do end sale of bump stocks.

1674 2018-10-27 21:12:41 Ok still don't hear an argument for why we shouldn't ban AR-15s. Cause I can put up poles to prevent against a van. And a bomb is harder to make then buying a gun with a bump stocks. And we have fire alarms in Temple.
1675 2018-10-27 21:12:26 Great segment! Purchased my first stocks with the advice from a financial advisor in 2010 and doubled my money. Rotated in and out of a few sectors about once every 12 to 15 months. #HumbleBrag

1678 2018-10-27 21:06:22 I hate to agree, now, I believe in gun regulations. I do, particularly pistols which are responsible for 94% of all gun deaths. Prohibition of detachable stocks and possession of more than 4, magazines over 25+1 rds with a port flip.  Rifles and shotguns actually are least deadly
1679 2018-10-27 21:06:03 8 man smash where a max of 8 fighters are on stage at a time, as usual, but each player slot (1p- 8p) has 4 stocks that are each a different character, in which each of the 32 stocks (8 slots x 4 stocks) is controlled by one of 32 players individually (?)
1680 2018-10-27 21:05:32 Ok so it's the most popular but what's the negative in banning them? Why not use another rifle. Whats the harm in banning bump stocks? You don't need that much power.
1681 2018-10-27 21:04:56 How about this partner? No High cap mags(10 rnds. max), no bump stocks, mandatory insurance for hand guns, proof of proficiency in firearms; no more gun shoe loopholes, national registry of AR's and 21 years old for ownership. Did I friggin miss anything?
1682 2018-10-27 21:04:46 The Simon Reeve programme is outstanding & depressing in equal measure. The devastation of fish stocks in the Med, the cruelty of mankind & I can’t get that imagine of that poor ill treated camel out of my mind.  I hope it’s suffering soon ends. #Mediterranean
1683 2018-10-27 21:03:30 Thanks  I usually get a faster feel than IBD if I judge how the leading stocks are doing.  They will usually start to act poorly before we start to see a cluster of distribution days .  Averages tend to follow the leaders in both up markets and down markets
1684 2018-10-27 21:02:30 Ok but the vast majority aren't AR-15s. So why not ban those and bump stocks? I don't get why these guns are so needed in society when there are several others that you could still use to bear arms.
1685 2018-10-27 20:56:18 So a class of firearms can be outlawed. And they should. Just as bump stocks should. There is no reason we need AR-15s in common society, even though they are "common".
1686 2018-10-27 20:54:54 the only problem being it wouldn't matter......2 days after the shooter in Las Vegas managed to kill and injure over 600 people, they going to ban bump stocks.  NOTHING WHATSOEVER DONE.
1687 2018-10-27 20:54:24 Automatic weapons have always been illegal, and FYI I have fired weapons with bump stocks and no they do not make them automatic, and they are extremely difficult to be accurate with
1688 2018-10-27 20:52:22 And yet you can't even support simple legislation like banning bump stocks. The gun used today was fully automatic. The hate/rhetoric coming from your supreme leader is fueling these magabombers and magashooters but thoughts and prayers and such
1689 2018-10-27 20:51:47 BIIIIIIIITCH! YES! *stocks up* my favorite highlighter of ALL TIME!!!
1690 2018-10-27 20:51:16 If they just restricted detachable stocks, capacity to a maximum of 75 rounds chambered for any semi automatic rifle with a 30rd maximum, people wouldn’t use rifles for shootings, statistically pistols kill 94% of people who die from firearms but that’s not really talked about
1691 2018-10-27 20:49:00 That way, federal government is not allowed to control local stocks of guns. Free society and all.
1692 2018-10-27 20:48:20 There is no reason that AR-15 or bump stocks should be allowed in America. These are weapons of war. We need laws to save people’s lives. This is one of the most serious issues of our time. It is a state of emergency. We need action TODAY. It’s far too late already for too many!
1693 2018-10-27 20:47:31 Defecation in a public restroom has its perks. I now know what stocks not to invest in.Just wish the guy would stop crying, its really messing up my Facebookism

I see world Great Depression 2.0
If you believe no collapse occurred, you are doing what everyone else is doing and ignoring the debts & believe there no consequence

1697 2018-10-27 20:46:13 I don’t want your f...ing guns but I want better background checks.  Also there is no use for bump stocks and we need to stop sell8ng weapons of war.  These are my opinions given with respect for yours.
1698 2018-10-27 20:45:53 Hey @netflix I put $25,000 of fake stocks into your company. If you could stop coming out with originals that would be great
1699 2018-10-27 20:44:31 Have the idiot talking heads started throwing out the dog whistles of: "bump stocks" or "bullet buttons" or "fully semi-automatic" yet?

Don't watch the news. But God bless you for being able to for me.
1700 2018-10-27 20:44:10 Really because the woman should on stage and said she supported healthcare and straight up voted against it.

1702 2018-10-27 20:43:49 How about taking a look at high capacity clips! Bump stocks, putting in universal background checks and close the gun show loopholes!
1703 2018-10-27 20:41:31 Any pro gun advocate who rails against commonsense gun control including banning assault rifles, bump stocks, and limitless magazines should google gun shot wound victims/images especially the ones involving kids-photos will do what words can’t which is why I won’t post them here

1708 2018-10-27 20:38:21 It's high time the top 30% richest Americans employed the bottom 30% as armed bodyguards (with bump stocks) . That would give "very different results" and make Americans gunmen again.
1709 2018-10-27 20:37:18 Our thoughts and prayers to all the gun manufacturers whose stocks may drop slightly on Monday after this latest terrorist shooting today.

1715 2018-10-27 20:34:36 The law Trump reversed when he got into office springs to mind; reinstating restrictions on mentally ill citizens. Another would be making bump stocks illegal. Trump verbalized that he would consider that until the NRA put a stop to it.  Restrictions on high capacity magazines.
1716 2018-10-27 20:33:59 Because it wouldn’t stop all crime doesn’t mean it isn’t worth doing.. What a dumb thing to say. Many many many mass shootings are committed with that gun. Why not make it harder for people to commit these kind of crimes? Ban bump stocks too while you’re at it
1717 2018-10-27 20:31:42 Stocks go up and down, but the groups that are popular now won’t be out of favor overnight unless there is a “scandal”. KPOP companies do have to build up their industry more but it is not going to completely flop all of a sudden either. This article simply oversimplifies!
1718 2018-10-27 20:31:14 Standard shoots 223 NATO shoots 5.56. I have an SKS, my father in law the AR 223.

1723 2018-10-27 20:26:10 Remember after the Parkland shooting Trump said he thought banning bump stocks was a good idea?

Remember all the Republicans calling for stricter gun laws?

None of it ever happened because the @NRA didn’t agree!

It’s time to stop the NRA by voting out the Republicans they buy!
1724 2018-10-27 20:25:45 not worried about global demand. Tech stocks have been going up in the last 2 years. They have not lost 1 trillion in market value. Fox business in the morning says your wrong and it has nothing to so with China.Stop the hate and lies

1732 2018-10-27 20:20:46 @POTUS is more concerned with his rally tonight than he is with changing gun legislation that will ban assault weapons to protect American citizens who decide not to carry arms. Why are gun stocks still legal? @JimAcosta @AprilDRyan @soledadobrien

1737 2018-10-27 20:16:40 It could be, but it’s patterns that I see in stocks tbh. Ik people in the billions can move it, but not like someone with millions can to a penny stock
1738 2018-10-27 20:15:38 Assault weapons & bump stocks are weapons of war & have no place in civilian society.  Keep 2nd amendment reasonable & responsible.  BAN weapons of war.  Limit artillery, Limit ammunition.  SOMETHING!  We MUST DO SOMETHING
1739 2018-10-27 20:14:12 ICYMI Chris Williamson-heavy fund managers are looking beyond FANG stocks for their future investments. @onehitgit explains…
1740 2018-10-27 20:13:30 All the stocks keeps going down, all over the world, and gold continues to boom, with challenges, big players may choose gold n BTC over traditional stocks, and it’s happening now! Choose wisely!!
1741 2018-10-27 20:13:14 This day and age? Of legal assault rifles and bump stocks? Why don’t YOU do something about it? It’s obvious you don’t care, you love the NRA. It’s not the least bit surprising. It’s expected. Cause you republican fools won’t enact gun control legislation!!
1742 2018-10-27 20:12:29 Dean heller got $108,515.00 from gun lobbyists while a congressman for NV District 2. What he's gotten the past 6 yrs 4 keeping guns in the hands of mass murders?  Assault weapons & bump stocks are weapons of war & have no place in civilian society.  Keep 2nd amendment reasonable
1743 2018-10-27 20:11:32 The stocks I own are so sad right now... :'(
1744 2018-10-27 20:11:05 Thought that he had told you recently that he would ban bump stocks.  Once again he lied to YOU, a supposed friend.
1745 2018-10-27 20:10:16 This no alternative to Modi is a funny thing. Except screwing the economy he has not done anything.  See the share market. Most of the stocks are at five year low.

Assault weapons & bump stocks are weapons of war & have no place in civilian society.  Keep 2nd amendment reasonable
1747 2018-10-27 20:09:20 Actually it’s not that simple to to make a weapon fully automatic and bump stocks don’t make weapons fully automatic either
1748 2018-10-27 20:08:20 We still haven’t  banned bump stocks or made background checks universal before buying firearms. “All countries have extremists, but there’s no reason we should give them access to assault weapons and large-capacity magazines!” - Nicholas Kristof #onemorepainfulreasontovote
1749 2018-10-27 20:07:12 If you're going to invest in stocks - and you should - don't be afraid of economic downturns if you have at least 5 to 10 years before you retire or need the money. Downturns are opportunity!
1750 2018-10-27 20:07:02 I’m utilizing a 50/50 ratio. Stocks/Crypto.
1751 2018-10-27 20:06:32 How come you can buy stocks when you cannot pay the judgment Arizona has against you for ripping off elderly people?
1752 2018-10-27 20:06:13 Oui, je crois qu'on a laissé assez d'avance aux Parisiens, là. Ils vont en prendre deux au Vélodrome, et trois à la Mosson (tarif syndical, non négociable, ni repris ni échangé, dans la limite des stocks disponibles), puis on ira gagner là-bas, puis à Lyon, puis...
1753 2018-10-27 20:05:56 I'm particularly not speaking about a stock increase here, a stock decrease I'm talking about and no correlation between $BTC and stocks whatsoever more in this tweet.
1754 2018-10-27 20:04:39 Trade #stocks will never be the same, millennials will trade #crypto. This is the real #flippening 
1755 2018-10-27 20:04:25 Maybe. . But all u need is to find a dozen good bets & deploy it when its in ur zone. . 80% stocks peaked in dec-jan but markets peaked in aug , + Stocks will bottom-out well before market does! As he said , just add as it goes down & Pray it goes up as fast as it fell ;-)
1756 2018-10-27 20:04:11 Mr. Pence, when you say "this evil must end" just how do you plan to do this when every day more guns are sold, and no gun is taken away.  Even bump stocks cannot be stopped!
1757 2018-10-27 20:04:10 Yep. Check the rest of the worldwide markets - all stocks dropping. But we aren't likely to hit a duster and see 70% disappear. Jog on porkchop.
1758 2018-10-27 20:03:21 I think it sucks too, but I think they also do the same with currency trading and obvs stocks. So I guess they are discounting those industries too? It's hardly 50%. I roughly use 30%. To ease calc I think they should let us do cash-in cash-out. Nope tho
1759 2018-10-27 20:02:41 Universal Background checks are impossible. 

Bump stocks are just one way to use the technique. It can be done with a belt loop. Should we ban belt loops too?

1761 2018-10-27 20:02:06 *sees stocks are down nearly $2G for the month*

... Burn baby burn... I want them to plummet so I can buy more and profit around 2030-ish or so.
1762 2018-10-27 20:02:04 How about the American carnage stops right here and stops right now?
The Wall
Repealing the ACA.
Tax cuts for poor and middle class.
Release his tax returns 
Ban bump stocks 
Give up golfing
Stop tweeting, etc.
Look up these, he said them all.
1763 2018-10-27 20:01:06 90% of high PE tech stocks with these kind of vectors is down 20% + over the last month. Big whoop.
1764 2018-10-27 20:01:01 You #Millennials have jobs now and most of you have #healthcare through your work. Many of you own homes, stocks, and other taxable property now. Think about that before voting #Democrats into Federal, State and Local offices. #Vote2018

1767 2018-10-27 19:59:18 @msexcel @microsoft @MicrosoftHelps @Office365MS @Office Are the new stocks and geography data types available on the 2019 desktop version? Thanks.
1768 2018-10-27 19:58:14 You know zero of what you’re talking about. I’ve called mags clips twice now. Bump stocks have nothing to do with this. They’re available 4 several different guns. Recoil? Recoil on a semi auto is negligible for target acquisition and accuracy. They’re not shooting that fast.
1769 2018-10-27 19:56:01 @ftweekend yet again, another fine piece of clear and sharp writing from @MerrynSW "bright lights of market illusion are dimming", accessible, yet authoritative - in a couple of columns sets out reasons for stocks diving in last month or so. Quite a show.
1770 2018-10-27 19:55:35 Odd you have psychic abilities to know what others hear and think...what stocks are going up, up, and up?  What are winning Power Ball numbers?
1771 2018-10-27 19:55:06 I don't trade stocks but that looks mighty fine.
1772 2018-10-27 19:54:33 That’s what you do with good stocks. Thanks.
1773 2018-10-27 19:54:15 OK, sorry. Slightly, purposely degraded weapons of war, by law, that are easily converted back into weapons of war by accessories (bump stocks), kits, ingenuity and the internet. BTW, read about how a bullet fired from an AR-15 was designed to kill. Ricochet, pulverize bone.
1774 2018-10-27 19:53:36 Something else seems to be brewing . Its worth noting Euro zone stocks are down 10% this year , deutschebank share price is falling , emerging markets are suffering due to a stronger dollar , increasing global debt ,then the trade war etc . The world economy isn't great .
1775 2018-10-27 19:53:29 You haven’t even managed to ban bump stocks or propose common sense gun regulations. Basically you’ve done a bigly fat nothing to curb violence. Indeed you seem to revel in your hateful cult followers
1776 2018-10-27 19:53:26 Every stock is like a human being: it has a distinctive personality; aggressive, reversed, hyper, high strung, volatile, boring, direct, logical, predictable, unpredictable. I study stocks like I’d study people. After a while their reactions become predictable

1785 2018-10-27 19:48:55 You would have to know the value of stocks for example and also, I’m yet to see a version of time travel where actions don’t have a ripple effect distorting present/future events.
1786 2018-10-27 19:48:15 Fed is bad. But @realDonaldTrump can mitigate the problematic tech bubble caused by dishonest valuation. Need "valuation cop".

1787 2018-10-27 19:48:11 I shoot trap & belong to 3 Sportsman’s Clubs. None of the shooters I know had heard of a bump stock before Vegas. 

Banning bump stocks is a meaningless token gesture.
1788 2018-10-27 19:46:37 Ed,  I submit to you & all:  Ban the Manuf,  Sale, & possession of all AR-15 AMMO. .223  & 5.56 Nato.   No more discussion about clip size or bump stocks.  Illegal to possess the AMMO...  I don't care about the guns as they are no good without ammo

1792 2018-10-27 19:45:23 We do know the pain! When will you ACT to end this? Ban AR type weapons and bump stocks for good? Universal background checks. At least TRY instead of offering thoughts & prayers every few months! #SensibleGunControlNow
1793 2018-10-27 19:44:38 Bonjour @Solary,
Quand est-ce que il y aura le rapprovisionnement des stocks pour les maillot Solary/Lunary ?
1794 2018-10-27 19:43:41 stocks rise by 1%.
1795 2018-10-27 19:42:58 Stricter gun laws. Ban assault weapons. Ban bump stocks.
1796 2018-10-27 19:42:02 There are such things as bump stocks that allow you to mimic automatic firing on a semi automatic legally. So visually a semi w/a stock & an automatic have barley any difference.
1797 2018-10-27 19:40:56 Don't just rely on this list. Explore the universe of 6000+ stocks. Research sectors, headwinds, tailwinds, upcoming global events. Where India and its corporate stands on global front. Track growth. Track politics and anything that may influence stocks. And you are done..
1798 2018-10-27 19:40:31 So how is it ok for them to do that and it not ok for Elon to say he was thinking about it and he gets in trouble but they get to use stuff like this knowing that it would hurt the stocks ...hmmm where is the justice's in that .    Damn sounds way to unfair I would say .hmm
1799 2018-10-27 19:40:26 Haha!!! Would expect nothing less x
1800 2018-10-27 19:39:41 That name alone is the reason why we pity everyone of you. Signed, the rich with stocks and mutual funds. Lord knows you made trump way richer.
1801 2018-10-27 19:39:33 I know one thing that they are pushing for is a ban on bump stocks, which I agree with. Civilians do not need to turn their rifles into machine guns. We may disagree there. The rest is just a deeper vetting on background checks and enforcing said background checks.
1802 2018-10-27 19:39:30 Not at all, I'd hedge the Bitcoin position w/ physical coined gold, stocks, real estate in relatively stable countries. And I'd keep some little emergency fiat buffer (USD for liquidity, CHF for relatively positive geopolitical outlook). Bitcoin could still fail. Just NO alts.
1803 2018-10-27 19:37:08 Ban the Manuf--Sale, and Possession of all AR-15 style ammo.  .223  &  5.56 Nato
Ban all of it.  then no arguing over clip size, and bump stocks & the Goofy NRA. That style gun was made to digest humans. Yank all ammo. do something Positive. Talk is Cheap & Whiskey Costs Money.
1804 2018-10-27 19:36:01 $SPY  probably a good time to replace FANGs in nasdung 100 with pot stocks - bullish - oh yeah! get this junk just up.  LOL.
1805 2018-10-27 19:35:29 I thought bump stocks was now banned!? So they're still talking about what they're going to do. And still haven't done it!?..
1806 2018-10-27 19:35:00 7. Chance for speculators to move over to something more useful. Like trade weed stocks for example.
1807 2018-10-27 19:33:20 There are plenty of concrete proposals, from limiting the size of magazines, to limiting the types of weapons, to banning bump stocks, to limiting access to those who have been convicted of certain crimes, to trigger locks, to fingerprint tech, to required gun safety & gun locks.

1811 2018-10-27 19:28:50 October was a bloody month for stocks had one of my best months this year. Quite a few put options paid handsomely glad I can trade in both directions
1812 2018-10-27 19:27:25 All in means 100% position, I have many stocks within my PF. Fully loaded means great avg and taken advantage of all the lows. Happy with #AAOG when this moves as expected I’ll be laughing. If not I’ll make it back on the others in my PF.

1815 2018-10-27 19:23:42 My restaurant stocks it and sells its for more, so I just asked if I could buy a box for myself lmao
1816 2018-10-27 19:22:27 Some investors never touch stocks that are losing money and I get that.  But looking backwards and not forwards is a painful lesson you learn over the next few weeks when the your "puts" fall or you are forced to cover.
1817 2018-10-27 19:17:21 Maybe you saw a couple but you phrased your tweet as if it was most. MOST liberals have no problems with hand guns... we just want stricter background checks, assault weapons ban, no armor piercing bullets and no bump stocks.
1818 2018-10-27 19:16:58 It's basically a basket of stocks that track the general market so that one is not exposed to short term market ups and downs but the longer term uptrend of the general market.
1819 2018-10-27 19:15:47 Raising rates are meant to address price increases in real goods and services.  The distinction with asset price inflation is that only involves switching from one asset to another, say from cash to stocks.  The asset of housing is obviously more of a gray area.
1820 2018-10-27 19:15:32 Exactly. People buying ICO tokens should look to buy stocks in companies, instead of tokens that are redundant or useless.
1821 2018-10-27 19:15:11 Crypto traders are going to have to turn to trading binary options on pot stocks. Crypto just not volatile enough any more! Bitcoin volatility below that of traditional us equity benchmarks now

1827 2018-10-27 19:07:22 Educate yourself , not about manufacturing automatic weapons

Semis can easily converted to auto by using bump stocks etc 

So u think it’s ok for folks with an IQ under 70 or  so to own guns ?
It’s their right too to own guns?

get real
1828 2018-10-27 19:07:05 Harper blew the surplus, cut taxes unnecessarily and finally left office with a razor thin "surplus" boosted by withholding funds to veterans services and one time sale of GM stocks at a loss.

1857 2018-10-27 18:44:46 While you are praying with metaphysical indolence and praising our system of reactive safety, I will be voting for: universal background checks, raise the gun ownership age, gun safety training, close gun show loophole, ban bump stocks, and possibly ban assault style weapons.
1858 2018-10-27 18:44:23 My local @sainsburys is rightfully known as Gay Sainsbury’s and stocks Patisserie Valarie so it has its merits.
1859 2018-10-27 18:44:07 I’d like to have them in the stocks for a few weeks. We can throw all the stockpiled spam at them.
1860 2018-10-27 18:43:19 I would hazard to say that anyone that has stocks related to healthcare has done well.  And in the meantime, those investments have allowed the medical community to expand facilities and produce thousands of jobs.
1861 2018-10-27 18:42:56 they haven't even managed to address bump stocks......and that shooter managed to kill and injure over 600 people
1862 2018-10-27 18:42:30 If I open a PATREON account for VIP signals. Where I will post my buy signals, speculative watch list, retirement income portfolio stocks, Tax tips. I may even put up my MA blueprint.  Please Vote & share.  Thank you. VIP$=25USD/Mnth
1863 2018-10-27 18:42:29 I know. But there’s truth to it. And people who got into investing because crypto may not know. The markets are very similar. Altcoins are penny stocks. They can make you very rich and very poor
1864 2018-10-27 18:41:20 so you make money as stocks go down?  *mind explodes*
1865 2018-10-27 18:41:17 Could there be a compromise, like an essay on what your kids are doing while a white nationalist confab occurs far way? Maybe even see if the market ups and downs match Pippa's quest for the tennis ball. "Following a failed attempt at retrieval of a stick, stocks closed lower..."
1866 2018-10-27 18:40:58 They as "cashing in" and the economy will tank.  After the tank, they will use the money to buy foreclosed homes and buy up stocks.
1867 2018-10-27 18:38:58 No, the people are not for UBCs since they are unenforceable and unconstitutional.
Get the inner city gang members to register their firearms and go through an FFL. Won't happen.  
Bump stocks are a gimmicky piece of plastic and have no bearing on crime. Only used once in Vegas.
1868 2018-10-27 18:38:44 Why not enact gun control.

Nobody needs semi automatic guns, bump stocks....oh yah didnt he commit to bump stocks?
1869 2018-10-27 18:38:40 - que tu répares ma tête et mes sentiments qui ne fonctionnent plus bien que tu refasses mes stocks de sérotonine que tu me dises que c’est rien
1870 2018-10-27 18:37:35 @MarkCubanCEO Have researched stocks for 60 yrs but more recently in depth with Net research capability. I will tell U my best. If you decide to

1871 2018-10-27 18:36:46 Unlike investing (stocks) into production a savings account doesn’t contribute anything to the economy. No wonder #BTC is on its way to 3k with 0 use cases
1872 2018-10-27 18:36:45 I know how you feel my mate 20 pro is also delayed as the stocks are low
1873 2018-10-27 18:34:37 Yep, you are sucked into that cult. No reasoning with you lot. I never said ban all guns, just ones made for war, bump stocks & harsher restrictions & background checks & waiting periods for purchasing a firearm. Also firearms training & raising the age limit to 21.
1874 2018-10-27 18:33:42 You’ve had ample opportunity to pass universal background checks, red flag laws & legislation banning bump stocks & assault weapons. This common sense reform saves lives & protects 2A rights. You’ve done nothing but accept blood $ from the NRA, a gun proliferation death org
1875 2018-10-27 18:33:41 Even though GOP policy on guns is horrible, Trump would rather have people talking about guns than about the economy that is still so terrible for so many average Americans, while the rich keep getting richer.

Oh, and stocks have been tanking for two solid weeks.

1878 2018-10-27 18:27:10 Stocks are diving - except for example @patriot1tech delivering "a New Standard in Weapons Detection" with its small radars. Perhaps this tells us something about why the market is shaky? People are getting killed, #maga is turning terrorist...

1884 2018-10-27 18:21:37 hmmm. So I guess schools, Universities, Movie Theaters, Malls, Night Clubs, Gay Night Clubs, Concerts, Amusement Parks arent as worthy. Here's an idea @VP aka dipshit, how about reducing access to AR-15s, weapons of war, bump stocks and Universal background checks.

1887 2018-10-27 18:18:49 RSI Positive divergence in many stocks may be indicating a possible market turn around, lets wait and watch
1888 2018-10-27 18:18:03 It is Not unconstitutional to ban bump stocks or specific weapons and accessories from being manufactured or purchased. Also they do have e more gun regulation. And they don't have their people in power spewing hate. Or an NRA funding politicians.
1889 2018-10-27 18:17:20 Heck no they need access to them. Some of the stuff that I find out is legal makes me question everything. Like bump stocks? There was no reason for things things to even be made at all
1890 2018-10-27 18:17:20 Taking this and thinking about the Canadian Housing market which has been inflated, the rally in speculative investments in Canada (i.e. Cannabis stocks) and people stretching out car loans to ease the monthly payment means Canada is hitting a tipping point.
1891 2018-10-27 18:17:09 Sell the stocks, take your losses, put losses into crypto, make gains.
1892 2018-10-27 18:16:02 I delete twetes sometimes but nothing related to stocks or finance. If you’re not willing to be owned you’re a coward
1893 2018-10-27 18:15:09 Hmm a growing Asian community in Stuttgart probably for those studying in Uni. Wondering if that would mean also more stocks of Korean/Asian groceries and restaurants...
1894 2018-10-27 18:14:19 This is for our after-tax accounts, mind you. I’m not touching our retirement accounts, which are probably 85% stocks, 15% bonds or LendingClub notes.
1895 2018-10-27 18:13:49 Why is there not better access for Large Print books? @RNIB stocks precisely zero Large Print that are not their own info leaflets. Everything is geared to audio books. F all use to me, I am also deaf. Find it such a struggle when I see books I want to read, but no Large Print!
1896 2018-10-27 18:13:47 I look forward to when some more other NASDAQ business's can become further decoupled from the overall index performance which Facebook has grown to become such a big part of (along with the other "FANG" stocks).

That decoupling may take some serious time, which will be choppy
1897 2018-10-27 18:13:42 Rsi divergence should just be used to add stock on watchlist , or at max tracking position (based on whatever signals/indicators one uses.  Price follow-up should be awaited in taking proper position. Ur right that this divergence is there on plenty of stocks
1898 2018-10-27 18:13:27 Trading stocks is the play y’all great way to grow your money if you do it right
1899 2018-10-27 18:13:20 Many states and cities DO ban AR's. And as far as Bump stocks, they're pretty much gone already. No, a ban hasn't been enacted, yet. It is supposed to be 'coming soon'. But it's still not much more than a novelty.
1900 2018-10-27 18:13:11 We’re transitioning to a portfolio heavy in short-dated bonds and minimal stock exposure (70/30 bonds/stocks to start with and a transition to 90/10 over the coming year and eventually 100% bonds). Certainly a heavy exposure to cash/short-term T-bills as well.
1901 2018-10-27 18:13:03 YOU ARE NOT THE PRESIDENT! BEING PUTIN OUR WH BY RUSSIA DOES NOT MAKE YOU LEGIT! YOU ARE THE WORST PERSON, SO FULL OF EGO & BS! GTFO OUR WH! WILL YOU NEED TO BE DRAGGED OUT?

1902 2018-10-27 18:12:57 Bring back the stocks. The only thing for these people is public humiliation.

1906 2018-10-27 18:10:13 When @MikePenceVP says “do everything in our power” to stop mass shootings, does that include outlawing bump stocks, large mags, assault weapons, or anything else counter to #NRA ? #StonemanDouglas

1910 2018-10-27 18:08:34 There is no best recipe. You have to find what suits you. 

My recipe is a diversified mix of
- stocks 5%
- btc 20%
- alts 20%
- real estate 25%
- commodities 5%
- fiat 30%

%’s vary in time, depending on personal (financial) situation, marketcycles and human emotions.
1911 2018-10-27 18:06:02 When the taxes fluctuate, meaning it goes from democrat to republican, democrat to republican, they're going to take their profits and clear debts, buy back stocks, not just pass it out to everyone, because it's a matter of time before the taxes go back up.

1916 2018-10-27 18:01:54 Not stocks I’d personally hold, I prefer progressive dividend companies myself as the chances of the share price also going higher is good.

1918 2018-10-27 17:59:17 Given the amount of freedom here - choice of comparison, scale, timing - as well as the chance of equivalent matches with other stocks - I'm very surprised that the Lehman line has significant predictive power.
1919 2018-10-27 17:57:29 1) They are pretty liquid: that's what stock markets are for. 
2) Cash assets are not interest-bearing. 
3) Stocks provide dividends to their holders, although admittedly, Amazon doesn't.
1920 2018-10-27 17:55:56 I saw after the market crashed in 2008. under Obama, housing, stocks and jobs steadily improved. There was Also the much needed bail out of GM and Chrysler. Trump inherited a good economy.

Down river thinking at its worst.  Instead of pouring more guns into the country, stop inciting your followers to violence.  Funeral home stocks looking bullish
1923 2018-10-27 17:54:20 2 things for u-
Don't connect 2 different stocks. Icici bank gave good results...so this should go up?? If Kotak bank gives bad results, will this go down ?? Secondly, morning star is a 3 candle pattern...do not predict if it will form the pattern or not until completion
1924 2018-10-27 17:52:47 No, no it isn’t. Not at all. 

The NRA is against universal background checks, even though most gun owners are for it. 

The NRA was against a law that would’ve banned bump stocks, even though the president himself called for a ban. 

The NRA ONLY represents the gun manufacturers

1934 2018-10-27 17:44:59 Sensible gun laws: Reduce easy access to dangerous weapons by banning high capacity magazines and bump stocks, requiring universal background checks without loopholes, instituting waiting periods, and reinstituting the assault weapons ban immediately.
1935 2018-10-27 17:43:37 Waiting for that bounce to reshort... the play, in almost all tech stocks IMO, is short the bounces. If they start selling $APPL next week, it will be easy money on the short side. Just short and wait a couple of days to get paid kind of day  Jmho - HAGW

We want:
1. Universal background checks
2. Prohibit mentally ill from (legally) purchasing guns
3. Prohibit convicted domestic violence criminals from purchasing...
4. Ban Assault weapons!
5. Ban bump-stocks!

That’s a start!

1939 2018-10-27 17:41:53 gs (mass shootings) are statistically tragic but highly unlikely, roughly 250 die a year from all rifles, and 200 from all shotguns, however near 9,500 from handguns!! Which is shocking. Ban detachable stocks and magazines get 30 rds and really pistol laws could save thousands an
1940 2018-10-27 17:41:50 How about he was going to make bump stocks illegal, how about he would show his tax returns once they were not being audited.
1941 2018-10-27 17:40:17 So if criminals are going to commit crimes no matter what, shouldn't we limit the access to eating that make them really effective at killing lots of people?  How many people would have been killed at LV concert without ARs with large capacity magazines & bump stocks?

1950 2018-10-27 17:35:09 Yes. This country has a gun problem. We cannot keep brushing it off with “it’s the mentally ill.”  We need to address how easy it is to obtain a gun, and what parts are up for sale (I.e. bump stocks, etc).
1951 2018-10-27 17:34:39 PA will maybe reconsider bump stocks and magazine size depending on specifics. 
NRA (the old-school version) is specifically mentioned as a setter of standards in at least one #ncga law.

1954 2018-10-27 17:34:09 Legalized bump stocks.
1955 2018-10-27 17:34:06 It’s horrible our stocks took a nose dive.
1956 2018-10-27 17:33:52 Why should the US have to have armed guards everywhere when the real solution is to not let everyone have guns? Other countries do it so we could.  There’s no use having such free access to automatic weapons, bump stocks, etc. Let’s use common sense and not let the NRA guide us.
1957 2018-10-27 17:33:35 In the coming years

1963 2018-10-27 17:28:20 Can’t argue with that sir, murder after murder, mass shooting after mass shooting and all that’s happened is bump stocks have been banned, the whole U.S. administration should be hanging their heads in shame... yet again another tragic waste of life.
1964 2018-10-27 17:27:52 As a reminder.  Bump stocks are still legal.
1965 2018-10-27 17:27:15 Glad you for identified yourself as a Nazi with your handle. The NRA blocks common sense gun laws that would make it difficult for white supremacists who are mentally disturbed to obtain guns. The NRA fights to keep automatic weapons of war and bump stocks readily available.
1966 2018-10-27 17:27:12 Bullish for stocks naa sir
1967 2018-10-27 17:26:57 This is 45’s 2nd amendment at work. Still nothing done about bump stocks and banning AR-15
1968 2018-10-27 17:26:22 Well, of course, there is a risk in buying stocks, but there are companies that pay dividend yields in at least the 2-3% range. In Canada, we have REITs that pay higher dividend yields.
1969 2018-10-27 17:26:17 The world's stocks represent #Ponzi schemes. 

What do you think happens with all Ponzi schemes?
1970 2018-10-27 17:26:03 Even though GOP policy on guns is horrible, Trump would rather have people talking about guns than about the economy that is still so terrible for so many average Americans, while the rich keep getting richer.

Oh, and stocks have been tanking for two solid weeks.
1971 2018-10-27 17:24:29 If you are one of those people who only votes based upon the performance of your stock portfolio or business cash receipts, understand this. Wall Street is NOT happy, is nervous and unsettled about @POTUS and stocks struggle if his policies continue.
1972 2018-10-27 17:23:32 Stocks have zero gamma, and people use them to express one-sided directional bets all the time.

The key insight of the paper is that delta-hedged returns are more negative when embedded leverage is higher. OTM front-month options have lots of gamma but negative expected returns.
1973 2018-10-27 17:23:20 Stocks should be % of over all portfolio which should not affect daily routine/like extra money which you dont need. This has helped me to be detached from overall market movements.
1974 2018-10-27 17:20:52 Don’t be a Libertard! If you’re not all in for GDP, you’re no MAGA man! Much less #MAGAII. What’s next, more bloody envirnimintal regs for saving ernimals and “trees”?

Now pipe down and buy stocks!  Or in your case, some beer down to the Walmart.

Still love Enterprise's business, but long-term renewables threat kept me from adding shares, and the point of my single stocks now is concentrated exposure to high-confidence names.

1980 2018-10-27 17:18:56 My dad wants me to learn how to do stocks and trade and all that shit
1981 2018-10-27 17:18:53 Yes seconds one expanding. Just from experience ive seen more running flats than expanding in traditional markets. Unlike what the books say. 
I have my reasons to believe that this the end of correction. Diveregences and stocks like appl have completed their flat.
1982 2018-10-27 17:18:51 And also something super messy in stocks (2400ish SP)

1985 2018-10-27 17:17:41 ates, not in democratic ones, allowing bump stocks and looser gun and ballistic vest, explosive material etc. access in most GOP states, 3)speaking at rallies and condemning media etc in geographically interesting areas 4) Threatening BEFORE the election “if I don’t win there wil
1986 2018-10-27 17:17:33 I've not looked into the stocks of the Swiss banks recently. I may do that soon as well.

1988 2018-10-27 17:16:27 There are guns w/Wooden Stocks that don’t have a military look 2 them that have the same capabilities. But because one “looks” scary we have 2 ban it ? Anyone properly trained w/a pistol can do the same harm. Guns are a tool. It’s the hands there in that make them benign or evil.
1989 2018-10-27 17:15:43 Well, I'm in Canada, and I invest in Canadian stocks and Canadian stocks don't seem to be in a bubble like in the U.S, but we have had large increases in housing asset prices in most major cities.  Governments here have attempted to address this situation.
1990 2018-10-27 17:15:38 Isn't this also an equally apt time to enter/pick right stocks. 
P.S: A novice Investor:-)
1991 2018-10-27 17:15:22 I think it’s been tricky w bonds because traditional asset allocation has been selling stocks and buying bonds, while risk parity selling both (not to mention Uncle Sam). I’m looking to get short long-term again, but I could see stocks falling until we get a sustained reaponse...
1992 2018-10-27 17:15:21 Trump is president now and it is his duty to pass common sense gun reform laws that will allow honest people to have guns but will crackdown on those that shouldn't have them, will ban bump stocks and assault weapons. Republicans have the majority in Congress but they won't try.
1993 2018-10-27 17:14:56 I let my kid choose a stock for his college portfolio. He bought Snapchat at $14 because his friends use it. Four months later it's at 6 dollars. He never wants to choose stocks again.
1994 2018-10-27 17:14:53 Yes time for investment in good quality stocks has come. But shud we go lump sum or do it a staggered manner..
1995 2018-10-27 17:13:24 You seem like a smart and good looking human. Now dump all of U.S. Silica $SLCA #Stocks

1997 2018-10-27 17:13:22 Well with the economy growing I moved up a pay grade,, tax break helps too. I finally can take my family on vacation again. Tech stocks IDK.
1998 2018-10-27 17:13:21 Well, for starters: people could consider paying taxes. Your fiscal morality is next to criminal and now you expect the rest of Europe to bail you out by buying rubbish stocks or low interest ECB-loans. And why should we be working till 67 while the lot of you wanna stop at 62?

2000 2018-10-27 17:12:56 I like the more expensive U.S. stocks (in terms of P/E ratios). If you want to own something good, you won't get it free. Amazon stock costs more than Sears. There is a reason for that.
2001 2018-10-27 17:12:34 If I got trapped twenty-five years in the past, I wouldn't know what stocks to buy, I don't even know how to invest in a company pre-Kickstarter, my fortunes are going to be entirely based on betting on Who Shot Mr. Burns.
2002 2018-10-27 17:12:11 Honey JYP became the leading company this year! Their stocks went down because stocks constantly fluctuate! Just wait until twice has a comeback.

2007 2018-10-27 17:09:56 Y’all remember that Ke$ha song:

tik tok on the clock,
ban assault rifles and bump stocks 
2008 2018-10-27 17:09:52 Who have taken this money to invest in assets, mostly either stocks or houses.  If you are concerned about asset bubbles, deal with this situation and don't penalize everybody by raising interest rates when there has not been a problem with increases in real prices.
2009 2018-10-27 17:08:38 @realDonaldTrump This is not rocket science. We need stronger gun controls and background checks and we need it now. Did you prevent bump stocks from being sold in the United States. I don't think so. You keep saying you will do something but you do nothing after each shooting.
2010 2018-10-27 17:08:31 When the economy is ginned up rigged for the top to buy back own stocks to trigger stock option bonuses & pay off only investors the market will eventually crash.
2011 2018-10-27 17:08:18 Their solution is to arm the whole God damn country to the hilt!! Schools Churches Synagogues City and Town Halls Stores Restaurants Gas stations and every single home condo apartment while they rake in the $$ from gun manufacturers stocks
2012 2018-10-27 17:08:16 Will you vote to increase background checks and limit the sale of firearms to prevent domestic abusers and other violent criminals from obtaining deadly weapons? Will you vote to ban bump stocks, high capacity magazines, assault-style rifles, and other unneeded weapons and parts?
2013 2018-10-27 17:07:13 Lmao, Obama already did that with Obamacare.  I tried to sign up for a plan under that system and would've ended up paying a shitload.  Insurance companies stocks have went up HUGE since then!!!
2014 2018-10-27 17:07:12 I swear i wanna work and god damn it im so gonna pampered myself & my daughter!!! Time for new stocks !! Jehehehe
2015 2018-10-27 17:07:00 I mean I know it's unrealistic but I'm also tired of people bending over backwards to assuage the fears of a paranoid few by making it about bump stocks or the like.
2016 2018-10-27 17:06:06 Haha, well I'll give you that. My page looks fake. I only joined twitter to follow the cryptocurrency projects that I day-trade. Stocks too. I wasn't here to socialize. Then I say Alyssa at the trial and got curious about her rhetoric. Eeeek, she's a mean one!

SIP must start now. Don't check NAV/price daily. Just add as it goes down. (There are stocks which are still overpriced, check PE/ROE before investing)
I'm going in hibernation to study good picks. All the best to you.
No sarcasm
2021 2018-10-27 17:05:41 Depends how you look at it. When fundamentals are great and stocks are cheap , that looks good to me. When fundamentals are weakening and stocks are expensive that's the danger
2022 2018-10-27 17:05:06 You are missing the point isn’t about stocks, 401ks it is about the economy and playing it like in the housing crash. These people are not us. People have lost their houses and 401ks because of economic games but the top players that I am referring to cashed in by the billions.
2023 2018-10-27 17:04:35 Well.. I mean we ALWAYS call people WITH guns to stop a gunman, no? I hate Trump but...yeah, HOWEVER PISTOLS are (DOJ, FBI) responsible for 94% of gun deaths in this country. Banning detachable stocks would save many but banning unregulated or “offensive handguns” #GunControlNow
2024 2018-10-27 17:04:31 The sell off started with the fear of higher rates (TNX above 3.2 per your chart) , then stop losses activated from quants below 50d and test of 200d fast forward. Rates are lagging stocks this time ( risk off) hence lower TNX. Reasonably, the market is questioning further hikes
2025 2018-10-27 17:04:02 These are tools I suggest using to address rising asset prices
1.Increase capital gains taxes
2.increase the top marginal income tax rates
3.Decrease the amount of margin buying for stocks
4.Increase 'stress tests' on housing buyers.
2026 2018-10-27 17:01:56 And push for and support meaningful gun control in the US. Ban the AR-15. Ban bump stocks. Regulate ammunition purchases. Standardize weapons regulation across states. Require training and licensing. Make the US as rational as Canada. Thank Zeus you and I live in Canada.
2027 2018-10-27 17:01:49 But what are you complaining about? Your regime is in power. You should  feel safe (ah, nope), well paid (ah nope), your stocks rising (ah nope),  and most of all since it's soooo good you should have no reason to  #WalkAwayMarch #TrumpCrimeFamily #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
2028 2018-10-27 17:01:19 When select stocks in an industry trade at 5-8 PE and 4-7x EBITDA at a time when they are going to generate some huge FCF that’s when you hit the bid. Tech multiples at all time high vs Energy multiples at all time low, I know it sounds simple but I’m buying
2029 2018-10-27 17:00:12 We follow #cannabis #stocks which trade on the #TSX, #TSXv and the #CSE - $GTEC, $TGIF, $GABY, $MMJ, $PYX, $OGI, $WEED, $PUF, $NGW, $HUGE
2030 2018-10-27 17:00:10 yep.....Just keep buying good stocks imo … markets will turn when they want … the money is made in the downturns/corrections and realised in the bull markets

2032 2018-10-27 16:59:12 Voilà leur but c'est de constituer un stock en Belgique pour la France.  J'avais déjà remarqué sur certains article que le stock était en Espagne je crois. Tout comme tu as des stocks aux usa
2033 2018-10-27 16:58:49 Don’t expect this President to do anything about gun control. If you remember last year he was going to ban bump stocks. He still hasn’t banned. bump stocks. He’s such a loser!!!!!
2034 2018-10-27 16:58:32 OMG WAKE UP ! HE WORKED FOR 8 YRS TO GET SENSIBLE GUN REFORM AND BETTER BACKGROUND CHECKS AND WAS BLOCKED BY THE REPUBS AND GUN LOBBY - DONT YOU DARE TRY TO PIN THIS ON HIM!
AND THE REPUBS AND TRUMP HAVE DONE NOTHING AFTER EVERY MASS SHOOTING THE PAST 2 Yrs
Remember Bump Stocks?
2035 2018-10-27 16:57:06 ....they NEEd to equalize gun laws. I would NOT BAN, any specific guns BUT a ban on detachable stocks, long foregrips, flash suppressors, silencers, threaded barrels and detachable magazines over 20+1 rounds, and any (fixed) over 30+1 rounds. However PISTOLS present statistically
2036 2018-10-27 16:54:39 How could he arrive at a “fair value” for stocks without factoring in interest rates? Surely equities deserve to trade at far richer multiples now than they did in, say, 1982?
2037 2018-10-27 16:54:37 If I don't wake up don't sell any of my stocks
2038 2018-10-27 16:54:28 Used last week declines to add few great stocks at mouth watering prices. Bajaj finance, Tata motors, edelweiss at mouth watering prices. Also added JK paper and radico Khaitan at Lowe’s of the week. #investing #BullsNation #stockstowatch #equities #stocks #longterminvestor
2039 2018-10-27 16:51:40 Yeah like PM said with the NFLX and FB getting revised down I think the market leaders are just changing after years of  growth stocks leading the charge. Otherwise, this massive correction has a lot of the same mind -sets of other sell-offs.
2040 2018-10-27 16:51:06 Shame on AMY? The president should do something about guns, or shut up. He hasn't even eliminated bump stocks, which he said several times he'd do. I won't say shame on you, but shouldn't you consider whether what your hero says can be believed?
2041 2018-10-27 16:48:49 Chris, great stuff indeed! Congrats! Solid stuff! Suggestion...? What about including current situation on leading stocks? I do think could further enhance your brilliant stuff!
2042 2018-10-27 16:47:51 Learning stocks.
2043 2018-10-27 16:47:22 Minimum brokerage fees tend to range between $6.99-$9.95, which means trading small parcels of shares quickly becomes uneconomical. #OnlineTrading #Investing #Stocks #SelfManaged
2044 2018-10-27 16:47:14 American tech stocks made a top with obscenely skewed risk reward ratio. Time to move to emerging market stocks. #NASDAQ. Reasons will come AFTER the stocks have fallen. #StockMarket
2045 2018-10-27 16:46:34 I agree. This is probably a rotational shift from growth to value stocks. I think there's a lot of perma- beras out there expecting much more damage. Fundamentally, just like February, it's not really reasonable.
2046 2018-10-27 16:46:23 And 20 % of stocks can destroy 80 % of the wealth if you have junk in the portfolio. Choosing wisely is the key!
2047 2018-10-27 16:46:06 Way more illiquid and not available for all stocks. I’d use puts if I wanted to maintain a short position for longer than a day but I am usually in and out of short positions the same day
2048 2018-10-27 16:45:31 Been a tough period for Value, but these things run in cycles. I own 3 of the stocks on your list
2049 2018-10-27 16:44:31 Yes Barbara being no longer in demand must be very bad for you. How’s your stocks doing? I’ll bet great!
2050 2018-10-27 16:43:48 Looking at long term nasdaq chart it seems we might be in a timeframe similar to October 1998 so we possibly got another 2+ years’ run left at least 
The leader of next leg up by tech stocks likely to be $tsla
2051 2018-10-27 16:43:35 So based on my little project #ARTU is up 3.41% on the week based on closing prices @ cob Fri 26/10/2018. Certainly alot better than the FTSE 100 which was down for the week. #ARTU stands for stocks in the Airline, Retail, Tobacco and Utility secotrs.
2052 2018-10-27 16:40:49 A madman a wacko, again not a terrorist. And the onus lies with synagogue to have an armed guard on duty & not with OUR government to BAN assault style weapons & bump stocks! #VoteLikeOurLivesDependUponIt #VoteBlue2018
2053 2018-10-27 16:40:46 Wow I almost cried looking at my stocks
2054 2018-10-27 16:40:02 Sit at work and look at stocks all day
2055 2018-10-27 16:39:42 Do you want to spend your time profitably? So you should find something very interesting and profitable. Look at it! #bitcoin #ethereum #ICO #cryptocurrency #blockchain #smartcontracts #finance #stocks #altcoin
2056 2018-10-27 16:39:39 And even bump stocks are still legal after all this time. At one point the president said he'd fix that. Really. If he's not gonna do anything, he shouldn't say anything.
2057 2018-10-27 16:39:38 U sud share ur view on ur suggested stocks like shreyans.
2058 2018-10-27 16:39:37 My thing I agreed on what he said, however his support of Trump is kinda confusing. Trumps policies have had the opposite effect that he wants on Black people. We should be investing in real estate, we should be investing in stocks, we should be investing in education.
2059 2018-10-27 16:37:53 Name the few stocks ...?
2060 2018-10-27 16:36:25 Hg invest in stocks gak ka?
2061 2018-10-27 16:36:18 You know how much time out the day I would loose if I had to wait that long for every page I open to load. especially with stocks.
2062 2018-10-27 16:35:49 Remind me again. Why didn’t Obama and the Dems ban high capacity magazines, bump stocks, “Assault rifles” when they had total control? This was just as big of an issue for them then? Next we can talk about their work on immigration reform.
2063 2018-10-27 16:35:44 Just a reminder that our elected officials have done nothing about bump stocks since Vegas despite widespread public support to ban them.
2064 2018-10-27 16:34:22 Rather than one line crap misinformation tweets how about you point out how anything I said is incorrect? I dare you. Stocks are down SMP is about to end its Bull Run. Farmers are taking bailouts from the government and transgender rights are being rolled back. All true.
2065 2018-10-27 16:33:51 I don't know what decisions you made personally, but certainly there were assets you could have invested in that are relatively safe and would have provided greater returns to you such as investing in a basket of dividend yielding stocks.
2066 2018-10-27 16:33:49 But if you look closely, you can see the Mac has no stocks

It was a ruse all along, he's already lost
2067 2018-10-27 16:33:36 @Bayer @Bayer4Crops  Your stocks are crashing for a good reason. You deserve to crash and burn as a company. Dismantle what's left of Monsanto, liquidate all of your assets and get out with your morals only slightly fucked.
2068 2018-10-27 16:33:18 Best time to buy some stocks
2069 2018-10-27 16:29:55 Ist eigentlich schon mal jemand von dem Hin und Her eines #Blinden-Stocks hypnotisiert worden?^^
2070 2018-10-27 16:28:58 I'm getting 3.2% with TD for 3 months under their current promotion. A lot of the online banks are offering short term bonus rates you can cycle through until you buy stocks/property at the tail end of the next recession(hopefully 2019/2020).
2071 2018-10-27 16:28:34 Ward is just class. I know our centre stocks are deep for Boks BUT that boy is a leader and a superb 13. Good thinker, good hands, great tackler.
2072 2018-10-27 16:25:47 Focus on the midterms and do not argue gun control with Russian trolls - this is a tactic they will use to get enthusiasm from their gun loving psychotic minions.  Background checks, a ban on bump stocks and other common sense measures will come - don't argue with anyone about it
2073 2018-10-27 16:24:36 We basically had your scenario for years and stocks were great and economy wasn’t in recession, so now if we go back there we go to recession? - Inflation low, rates low, GDP in recession, stocks 
2074 2018-10-27 16:23:19 Mark Twain quote: 

"October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February."
2075 2018-10-27 16:23:17 I will but, the Gin stocks are running low here need to stock up!!!
2076 2018-10-27 16:23:07 Interesting as I own Centurylink stocks. I would imagine company would take depreciation into account when comparing overall savings. AWS and MSFT are the 2 leaders as of Q1 2018. Surpised how fast MSFT taken piece of pie and beat on earnings too.
2077 2018-10-27 16:22:54 Sir, Question.

Last time HDFC bank, Hdfc, infy,kotak, TCS, Asian Paints,some pharma, reliance took part in journey of 9900 to 11800.

This time which stocks/sector help to pull up the market?

Thank you.
2078 2018-10-27 16:22:15 congrats!!! Namaste 
2079 2018-10-27 16:22:02 Obviously it would be nice to pay off and not have it in the system. But we didn’t repay it... it’s now baked in. 

The US appear to have paid for the 2007 financial collapse, by quantitative easing. Except Fed then used a lot of that printed money to buy US stocks...
2080 2018-10-27 16:21:57 Yes- only taking away their failed products and looking like heroes to the ANTZ at the same time. In the meantime their deadly cigarette stocks soar upwards
2081 2018-10-27 16:20:49 Thx. I was thinking of the fished stocks being in a 'healthy' state but indeed, many more ways to define better... particularly in an ecosystem context... Would be great to see your work repeated in Europe and globally. Nice paper!
2082 2018-10-27 16:20:18 Oh REEEEEEALLY? I haven't seen that ridiculous WALL, and I haven't heard of MEXICO paying for it.  I also haven't seen tRump's awesome NEW AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. Haven't seen him cure GUN VIOLENCE...and on and on. You idiots think that $$ in rich pockets helps YOU! Stocks DOWN
2083 2018-10-27 16:19:58 Imo its possible the dollar and gold has lost correlation and keeps a bid to protect wealth. Oil copper stocks etc down in deflationary environment, dollar gold bonds up.
2084 2018-10-27 16:19:36 LOL This isn't about manipulation. It is about riding a high. Take the safeties off and the market does really well for a while.  This isn't about owning a "few stocks".  The top 1% owns about 84% of all stocks AND they own lobbyists and politicians.  This isn't about joe average
2085 2018-10-27 16:19:18 Don't play the penny stocks.
2086 2018-10-27 16:18:35 The AR-15 and M1 Garand are not too different beyond looks and capacity.

I only agree on bump stocks, that they should be heavier regulated, not banned.
2087 2018-10-27 16:18:02 To be honest, I cannot see how that combination holds. Either inflation rises (and stocks move with it) or it does not.
Scenarios:
- Inflation up, rates low, GDP up: stocks 
- Inflation low, rates low, GDP in recession, stocks 
- Inflation up, rates low, GDP down, stocks 
2088 2018-10-27 16:17:51 Sir if u allow me give u a advice multibaggers will be only there if there is undervaluation coupled with under ownership. Look for those stocks sir
2089 2018-10-27 16:17:48 I bet this election has made the stocks for Ativan, Valium, Librium, Xanax, and Klonopin soar!  #Election2018 #Midterms2018
2090 2018-10-27 16:17:23 Your vision paid off. You're sitting on pure profit with higher yields than apple stocks 
2091 2018-10-27 16:17:21 Stock market is having the worst October since 2008, global stocks down, #GOP Trump trade wars sending us into global recession. #VoteBlue2018
2092 2018-10-27 16:16:38 It's beyond ridiculous that YouTube channels with several hundred thousands subs post each and every day videos of comparing AR 15s with AK47s or show off how bullpups or bump stocks work..stop that shit...
2093 2018-10-27 16:16:31 @RealTechStocks tech stocks are done. Look at the level they are now. NO STOCK RECOVERS from these drops. FB TWTR AMZN
2094 2018-10-27 16:14:39 So if someone said inflation and rates will stay contained and US GDP will stay in a 2.5%ish range for the next 5 years stocks can’t go up?
2095 2018-10-27 16:14:05 NEW DAWN FACTION stocks slump
2096 2018-10-27 16:13:40 Sir soon u will see there dividend evaporate. And these stocks are defensives they won’t up as well when markets recover sir. They are hiding spots
2097 2018-10-27 16:13:24 yep largely agree -- doubt we hit cycle/generational highs yet.  In fact, in my latest Series of posts to Sub's I think this year in many way's Echoes 2012.  When we lost $AAPL $NFLX etc... type leadership.  While market had been torturing "cheap stocks" for 2 Yr's running.
2098 2018-10-27 16:13:08 Like people are going to go to your Twitter account to seek advice on an active shooting?  LAUGHABLE!  Where’s the gun control?  Ban on bump stocks?  You’re just a con man. #DonTheCon #VoteBlue #UnfitToBePresident #taxfraud
2099 2018-10-27 16:12:33 That’s the 1st positive takeaway from this sell off that I’ve seen from anyone on FinTwit This wk.Big fan of your analysis & looking fwd to your thought into next wk.What concerns me most is behavior of financials and transports. Stocks and Bonds telling diff stories-1 is right..
2100 2018-10-27 16:12:06 The differences in the guns are not that big. Bump stocks are awful. But pistols can shoot just about as fast as rifles. There are no legal automatic rifles. So it would be odd to ban the AR-15 but not other hunting rifles. The AR-15 is too weak for deer hunting.
2101 2018-10-27 16:11:38 #ShoutoutSaturday to the #JLewisTrading community!!! I'm going to be sending out the new Trade Alert List shortly! I want you guys to be ready with a solid opportunity list for next week!

2102 2018-10-27 16:09:24 Youre full of crap.  Save the thoughts and prayers, how about enacting some common sense  gun  control laws in this country and making bump stocks illegal!!
2103 2018-10-27 16:09:00 tbh I really just dont wanna buy stocks at these P/E ratios
theres alot of wonky indicators pointing towards a crisis, however theres no true "go BOOM" - catalyst yet thats clear
2104 2018-10-27 16:08:40 Once upon a time we used to be happy about our stocks going up.
Now we are happy about our stocks not falling much. 


2105 2018-10-27 16:08:24 Love it when gas bottle goes, coldest day in past few months, to top it off Angela Stocks looks out of caravan window at me 
2106 2018-10-27 16:08:20 #Blockchain is a technology that, above all, lets us create new economies.

Transactions specifies a secure way to transfer a digital asset between participants in such an economy, w/out intermediaries.

Assets can be money, or anything else (movie tickets, stocks...)
2107 2018-10-27 16:07:26 Honestly we don't hide! Rain or Shine we'll have 5-20 stocks since 1983 & always a few junk bonds or muni's just anything but Treasuries since 1977.
2108 2018-10-27 16:07:18 Coal india and PFC are other good dividend yeild stocks
2109 2018-10-27 16:07:17 too many stocks 
2110 2018-10-27 16:06:15 The current financial system is unsustainable as I'm sure you know. I think people are just anticipating the inevitable. Stocks are overvalued too so I think people are expecting a sell off and subsequent crash. 2008 was just the beginning no doubt.

2112 2018-10-27 16:05:29 I made a mistake of not booking profits of 30% when Nifty made high in 2017. Then I will do the same  mistake again by selling stocks at 30% loss.
2113 2018-10-27 16:04:18 Hello as long as stocks are available, we'll be accepting orders.
2114 2018-10-27 16:03:59 Cannabis nationalization in Quebec:

- Government literally seizes means of production in agriculture, distribution, retail commerce
- Monopoly supply, no private property, Cannabis leaf symbol illegal
- endless lines, empty shelves, no stocks, closed shops

"NOT REAL SOCIALISM"
2115 2018-10-27 16:03:25 @felicitegrace will it be limited stocks only? Will it be like one selling online too? Will it be available in asia? Philippines to be exact?
2116 2018-10-27 16:03:10 Probably cause you bought the risky stocks. Mine is up 20% cause it is based in consumer spending on basic necessities and low cost consumer goods. People have more disposable income.
2117 2018-10-27 16:02:45 Didn't look too far left lol...nice gain..coulda smashed the long too though haha

2119 2018-10-27 16:01:02 A well balanced portfolio should include:

2124 2018-10-27 15:58:51 Let me try my hand. Socialists understand that capital is not just a factor of production but, as it is owned, also a factor of distribution. Think: somebody inheriting a lot of stocks. But also: slaves used to be 'capital', too.

2128 2018-10-27 15:56:16 And as I'm such a nice guy I will share with you how I knew it was long...RSI divergence was clear as day!
2129 2018-10-27 15:54:42 The Federal Reserve doesn't buy company stocks on the balance sheet - they get interest on the debt the create.

US Federal income tax goes towards paying down the debt.

The US is under debt enslavement to a private corp.
2130 2018-10-27 15:54:32 Remember the Gabbar Singh dialogue from Sholay ?
" Joh Darr Gaya, Woh Mar Gaya"
Buy quality stocks at reasonable valuations & don't be scared of bear markets.
You will be winners like Thakur and Viru of Sholay if you keep your nerve in a bear market.
2131 2018-10-27 15:54:21 The short looks as if it was entered at 1.75...I just commented based on the image...
2132 2018-10-27 15:53:22 Investing for 30 years, buying on dips.  Biggest mistake was selling anything.  I now have numerous 20+ baggers and dividend stocks paying 20% + based on initial cost.  Buy and hold  also means I am diversified in sectors, size, geography, growth and dividend. Stay the course!
2133 2018-10-27 15:52:38 Trumpy didn't pass ANY gun legislation, nothing on Bump  Stocks or anything... liar  in - Chief 
2134 2018-10-27 15:52:28 Asked this guy if he wants a free stock he said he dont like stocks  man what? U dont want free money? Click the link in my bio dont be an idiot. Lololol
2135 2018-10-27 15:52:21 Willand nearly snatch the win but Stocks was there to save it from going in
2136 2018-10-27 15:52:11 We need common sense  gun control laws in this country and to make bump stocks illegal!!  Republicans refuse to help the American people, THROW THEM OUT!
2137 2018-10-27 15:52:08 I see possibility of stock move down to 307 then rally to 359.    I made good money. Long and bullish on this investment.   Short many other stocks.
2138 2018-10-27 15:52:01 The Federal Reserve is a private corporation that prints trillions of dollars. The US has done trillions in quantitative easing which literally goes to pump stocks. The US Treasury issues bonds (debt) to the federal reserve banks which then give fresh USD to companies.
2139 2018-10-27 15:51:23 Crypto actually doing great bro. Little less volatility the past  couple weeks but still bagging minimum 2% a day...  thanks  for asking
2140 2018-10-27 15:48:38 But wait- I bought some stocks and they ALL are losing money!  This was NOT the right to invest 
2141 2018-10-27 15:48:18 It's more like God Help Us All! You support an amendment that was written for guns in 1789. Guns today are much different New gun laws should be up to date with automatic  weapons bump stocks ect....
You warn and the you bless people it's not good enough!
2142 2018-10-27 15:46:40 Remember when he promised to ban bump stocks and tightening background checks for mental illnesses when buying assault style rifles after the Florida school shooting??? It was his line for 3 days then back to usual pro-2A and NRA love fest. Disgraceful.
2143 2018-10-27 15:46:32 Trump said Hillary should lose secret service protection and see what happens. Said the 2a people should find her. Said there's good people on both sides when that racist drove his car into the antifa protest. Said he'll ban bump stocks never did. Etc. Etc. Etc.

#finance #blog #writing #topics #money #business
2147 2018-10-27 15:43:53 They have not even banned Bump stocks !!! If you wanna change Gun Laws then you must vote democratic !!! #Pittsburgh #MSNBC @NBCNews @MSNBC @maddow
2148 2018-10-27 15:43:07 @VP @realDonaldTrump @RepJohnFaso   Save the thoughts and prayers, how about enacting some common sense  gun control laws in this country and making bump stocks illegal!!
2149 2018-10-27 15:42:40 People not satistics are being causious withdrawing their stocks and waiting till after mid-terms. Been doing it since late June
2150 2018-10-27 15:42:33 @VP @realDonaldTrump @RepJohnFaso  Save the thoughts and prayers, how about enacting some common sense gun control laws in this country and making bump stocks illegal!!
2151 2018-10-27 15:42:25 Whether new economy or traditional economy, not to buy any stocks in China, I am losing many money in this investment.
2152 2018-10-27 15:42:15 Prolly 0 because i kinda want to seach this masterpiece, however i dont expect it to be the next big thing because the meme market is harder to understand than stocks..
2153 2018-10-27 15:41:54 Well done
2154 2018-10-27 15:40:10 I bet you most of those people who are in stocks know how to read a chart so buying cryptocurrency when alt coins are on their floor is a pretty smart move there guy
2155 2018-10-27 15:39:35 Also banning bump stocks and passing red flag laws
2156 2018-10-27 15:39:24 No more miners throwing stocks of dynamite at the Foreign Legion and the Moroccans then.
2157 2018-10-27 15:38:45 What’s that mean?  You mean if you don’t know if they are moving get rid of the stock ? I wouldn’t own any stocks then LOL
2158 2018-10-27 15:38:37 in melee when mango plays fox he recovers high like every time, takes some damage but makes it back and then does his thing onstage 

smash 4 fox is kinda like that imo his only goal offstage is to put his feet on the ground, and if he does and stocks are even the game is even
2159 2018-10-27 15:38:29 Preserving financial stability is one of the roles and wild movement in stock markets is never preferable. On a lighter note, the way things are, govt might need to announce MSP for NBFC stocks
2160 2018-10-27 15:38:19 Another day in America !!! and you have even banned bump stocks #SAD
2161 2018-10-27 15:38:15 I also thought the stocks icon line should point up and green or down and red based on current market conditions. However that was a bad idea since you need to figure out what index or even what exchange the user cared about.
2162 2018-10-27 15:38:07 Most Republicans agree that bump stocks should be outlawed but they can’t seem to do it ...
2163 2018-10-27 15:38:03 We literally just pulled back 10% since Sept. 2008/2009 we had the worst financial crisis of our lifetime and we still recovered and are MUCH higher now. We are nowhere near that environment. Earnings are strong, economy is humming. Stocks grind higher from here after midterms.
2164 2018-10-27 15:37:51 No bump stocks! No silencers! Comprehensive background checks! No cop killer rounds, No super shooter magazines, No cross country concealed carry permits.
2165 2018-10-27 15:37:49 How did bitcoin do for u buddy?
2166 2018-10-27 15:37:21 The short was at 2.03 and obviously you can see my covers, nail n bail
2167 2018-10-27 15:36:37 No .. not in a particular instance ... but the failure to deal with gun violence in America contributes to the overall murder rate .. he promised he would deal with bump stocks a year ago but then met with the NRA and forgot about that ..
2168 2018-10-27 15:36:13 Enough damage done, govt should now announce MSP (Min support prices) for NBFC stocks just as they do for agri products!!
2169 2018-10-27 15:35:25 My stocks are doing great so I'm doing great
2170 2018-10-27 15:35:06 No i didnt record, but yes its harder to do than smash 4, im not 100% sure about that but anyway if you have like 1 2 stocks ahead u can fair drag down and he cant do anything. My friend said he tried to jump i think he is not sure.
2171 2018-10-27 15:33:56 Ha ha get them whilst stocks last 
2172 2018-10-27 15:33:06 Now I don’t hold any fossil fuel based stocks .
2173 2018-10-27 15:31:44 I think there is political turbulence and markets are pondering whether this is the end of the cycle, hence stocks with high P/E tend to suffer. The question is: stay put or sell hoping to rebuy at better prices?
2174 2018-10-27 15:31:17 You keep calling for more fear but it is not going to happen. Things are not that bad, inflation is coming down, Fed would stop raising after December, midterms will lead to gridlock, and stocks will go up, they always do in the 3rd year of presidential term. Stop spreading fear
2175 2018-10-27 15:31:15 Then why tf are all my stocks in free fall?
2176 2018-10-27 15:31:08 How is this a story gold always goes up when stocks drop
2177 2018-10-27 15:30:10 He was one of the few that invested in Nike once they were boycotted and their stocks plummeted knowing they'd go back up. He made a bunch right there recently but honestly you should research where his money came from and his involvement with the dem party with his agenda.
2178 2018-10-27 15:29:27 Stupid. Buy stocks now! Great opp. Best investment over the LT. Not too many of these in a lifetime. Buy & hold! Forget gold. Will tank when WS analysts get off their drug highs. Look at corp fundamentals. Never better. This is where val comes from.
2179 2018-10-27 15:29:25 Stocks are overvalued. Last time they were this overvalued, they had a negative return from 2000 - 2010
2180 2018-10-27 15:29:21 Looking to finally put some cash to work.. 
No one can pick bottoms all you can do is invest when the risk reward odds are in your favor and I think that is now.
We are headed into seasonally the strongest 3 month period for stocks which should be a nice tailwind.
2181 2018-10-27 15:29:21 Thank you for answering my questions. I wish I could learn from you guys in person I have so many questions. I’ll keep following your tweets and learning  what program do you use to watch stocks?
2182 2018-10-27 15:28:59 it spiked to 2.11 yesterday! hahahahahahahahahahahna Better get back to the books brother...
2183 2018-10-27 15:28:40 Ended up taking 7 stocks right off the bat in the first crew battle ^_^ Go MTL clean up the rest of them for me  12-8 rn
2184 2018-10-27 15:27:01 Did you all forget you can make money shorting on stocks too? So no, he's great for the market.
2185 2018-10-27 15:26:58 Linux arm32 doesn't support ACPI. long story short, it could be doable, but it will be pain to do. not only that but we need to fix some memory map problems with stocks UEFIs.
2186 2018-10-27 15:26:53 Not looking over any stocks to review or study today. Just because you study extra more than others, That doesn't put you front of others who aren't studying. Sometimes you just got to get away from things and reset your mind. Cleaning my place today and enjoying the day off. 
2187 2018-10-27 15:26:45 @Deishma what command wud we use to scan stocks for upward  movement for future trades and in what TF
2188 2018-10-27 15:26:37 Good for y’all.  Worth noting this allays fears (caused by depreciation of construction stocks since June) of stagnating consumption.
2189 2018-10-27 15:25:52 blue wave stocks plummet red wave stocks rise, WATCH
2190 2018-10-27 15:24:20 The stocks are crashing only the top 10% are gaining, healthcare is costing triptsince this administration took over. This isn’t a great economy it is going to lead to a crash
2191 2018-10-27 15:22:21 I am yet to receive my free soundbar promised with the TV. It is over a month now. Why promise gifts when you have no stocks, and no intention to deliver it? The store still say they are yet to receive it from Samsung.
2192 2018-10-27 15:22:06 Walt Disney gave his housekeeper stocks every year for the holidays, and she died a multi-millionaire.
2193 2018-10-27 15:21:51 Easy, 
If democrats win stocks go down 
If republicans win stocks go up big
Choose wisely!
2194 2018-10-27 15:21:46 Autumn/year-end seasonality doesn't work in early-stage bear markets. See 2000-01 (stocks topped early Sept declined rest of year) and 2007-08 (stocks topped early Oct declined rest of year).
2195 2018-10-27 15:21:24 Can someone please point to what specifically is better in the economic environment?  Real question.  I’m trying to level up too.  The only thing I know is if you are in investing in stocks as an individual you are doing better.
2196 2018-10-27 15:19:21 So paul I guess you like:
Higher taxes
Open borders
Free food, shelter,healthcare & education for illegals
Chain migration & lottery
Sanctuary cities
Higher unemployment
Higher healthcare costs
Lower GDP
Lower stocks
Politicos that do nothing but obstruct
2197 2018-10-27 15:17:57 Unfortunately most of the retail guys end up with stocks from the 80% pack, therefore 0% returns in their executed timeframes :)
2198 2018-10-27 15:17:23 A new lexicographer is needed to come up with new terms when Virat Kohli scores tons because adjectives are out of stocks.
2199 2018-10-27 15:16:34 The stock market is saying a great deal. Basicly to be careful and skeptical of the "experts" and their opinions. The "goldilocks" economy may persist a little longer through increased government spending and lower taxes. But the downturn is peeking its head. #stocks #wsj #FT
2200 2018-10-27 15:16:28 I did say this on Feb 22, 2018
"I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!"
2201 2018-10-27 15:15:29 Eiiii yet still he is winning everything he's doing. Economy booms, stocks had high, lower unemployment hahahahaha what did the super failure Obama did. Hahahahhahah you seee he is working while the others are just manipulating you hahhahaahah pity
2202 2018-10-27 15:15:15 Your prayers are empty. Almost 25 months later after Las Vegas. Still... bump stocks are available. What is it you do? Promote hatred where ever you go.
2203 2018-10-27 15:15:09 Welcome new friends, any money talk is welcome. I have a basic approach for average middle class retail investors. Forex to raise cash...Allowing you to play stocks and options properly. PDT rules make me itch. ;) welcome
2204 2018-10-27 15:14:45 "Listening to 23 year old dudes in Yoshi onesies talk about their Tesla stocks in between sets"
2205 2018-10-27 15:14:24 50% correction is possible indexes is just a few highflying stocks. FAANG and few more. Top 20 stocks are what like 70% of S&P 500 now valuation? Lot of grossly undervalued stocks out there. Trick is to find them and determine if they are sustainable growth plays @MarkYusko
2206 2018-10-27 15:13:25 If only renewable energy companies could ‘donate’ millions to the tories along with stocks and shares, ‘seats’ on boards, revolving doors...
2207 2018-10-27 15:13:11 There’s been 2 ways to increase expected returns (indexes, 1994-2018):

1) Hold > stocks than bonds
Barclays Int’d Bond = +4.7%
Russell 3000 = +9.8%
MSCI All Country ex-US = +5.9%

2) Hold > value/small/profitable stocks
DFA US Adj Mkt 2 = +11.2%
DFA World ex-US Adj Mkt = +7.6%
2208 2018-10-27 15:12:59 a retest would have more money in more stocks than in February, not less... some bears are looking for a bounce right now and are scared they may not get it...
2209 2018-10-27 15:07:11 Good. Maybe young people will be able to afford stuff again when stocks and real estate come down 75%.
2210 2018-10-27 15:05:21 National debt, stocks tanking, allies are laughing at us. Going great!
2211 2018-10-27 15:02:07 Halloween candy is like stocks... you win some, you lose some
2212 2018-10-27 15:02:00 Agree here.  Dip in bonds, rise in rates. High rates will kill he DCB rally in stocks...bonds to explode!
2213 2018-10-27 15:01:39 New Stocks Arrived 
Fabric: Cotton Spandex 
Fit Small - Medium 
150 php only!
2214 2018-10-27 15:01:23 But you can have a fund manager doing all the right things (buying the right stocks / outperforming), an investor doing the right things (buying fund that outperforms), asset doing right thing (stocks > bonds) but if the asset class now returns < than last 5 years, investor gap.
2215 2018-10-27 15:01:21 And “my point” was answering your question, “how are your stocks doing?” A. Most don’t have any and B. Not well.

2217 2018-10-27 15:01:08 The monthly close on Wednesday being something to watch but so far, this price action in stocks looks like correction, not crash mode. No rebound just quite yet though
2218 2018-10-27 15:00:24 If it's almost all B&H passive long stocks they should be afraid. Probably not enough afraid.

2222 2018-10-27 14:58:19 Analysts' statements like this tend to trigger a huge sell-off of stocks. It happens in America too - when people put too much faith in the opinions of analysts. What he said was a bit fierce and he apologized for the headline - but the facts remain the same.

2225 2018-10-27 14:57:18 Why wouldn't stocks collapse before bonds?
2226 2018-10-27 14:56:38 I dont doubt that what you did was entirely legal. Whenever there is an artificial or real shortage created (in this case of currency notes) there is a rational tendency to hoard the available stocks. Each person who hoards >> than he needs makes d shortage worse. Some suffer.

Whose head will he stand on to seem bigger?

2248 2018-10-27 14:39:40 I don’t think it has anything to do with imbalances though. It has to do with a math equation. In this example, if US stocks are rising then young Indian / Chinese are the best investors ever by the investor gap metric. My point is... are they really?

2274 2018-10-27 14:19:05 If you want to eliminate most volatility between looks, tell you're clients it's your policy to do a complete portfolio review every 5 years. That's long enough to let the markets work assuming they have a diversified portfolio in stocks and bonds. In the mean time, don't look.
2275 2018-10-27 14:18:45 So? Overall, stocks have improved enormously. There is always leveling off esp this time of year.
2276 2018-10-27 14:18:39 Statistically, people who manage their own stocks tend to do this. Why the idea of privatizing Social Security should scare all of us. (Besides the obvious moneygrab by money managers and trading platforms.)

2282 2018-10-27 14:16:40 I forgot to mention, you apparently diversified your portfolio as an investor. Being long index funds and shorting stocks sounds like your hedging. Are you shorting certain stocks within your index funds?

2306 2018-10-27 14:00:58 That’s why you get in these stocks early if you can see it pre-spike. It is possible. I never chase this crap
2307 2018-10-27 14:00:53 Def. Would be a better investment. Moreover, I'm sure one can find one for free by digging in some old library archive or old stocks somewhere...
2308 2018-10-27 14:00:45 No idea about that number, but half of all Americans own stocks for example, so im sure its a significant number.
2309 2018-10-27 14:00:31 But what’s the difference - “he’s clearly guilty - take him out and subject him to public humiliation or put him in the stocks - there’s no need for a trial”. The principle remains the same.

2315 2018-10-27 13:55:29 I totally agree with you. I just prefer having my money at work all the time than having 20% of my money doing nothing. If I need to rebalance, I just have to sell some shares of my best performing stocks.
2316 2018-10-27 13:55:26 Not necessary that this is bottom. But when markets are in huge trouble, high dividend stocks are safe as downside will be much limited.
When Nifty was at 11500, REC was Rs 90. Now Nifty at 10000, REC is above Rs 100.
So high dividend stocks are safe havens now.
2317 2018-10-27 13:54:11 That is the question I’m trying to figure out for myself. Leaning towards synthetic because I tend not to be so worried about wear and tear. Wood stocks make me a little too cautious when handling it because they’re so nice.
2318 2018-10-27 13:53:05 Blackjack and poker are skill. Slots, roulette, and lottery are gambling.

2323 2018-10-27 13:51:32 But look at share prices, many good stocks trading at very high prices.

2325 2018-10-27 13:49:34 And tax cuts to all? Read the fine print. Please. 80% to the top 1%. Cut entitlements to make up the difference. Tariffs? Gas prices, wood up. Steel up. Soybean farmers can’t sell their products but your tax dollars go to their bank accounts like welfare. Corporate/ stocks

2338 2018-10-27 13:37:01 2 month correction in stocks in early 2016 had companies cutting expectations rapidly. I would expect retail sales to hit wall here and now. Housing, autos, semis already turned down.
2339 2018-10-27 13:35:44 The market is down though to be fair. Lots of blue chip stocks are down that much. BAC, T, RDS-A etc
2340 2018-10-27 13:35:15 I’m thinking you should move then if it’s so awful. By the way, how are your stocks doing?
2341 2018-10-27 13:33:40 it’s just a different approach,some people put protection of their capital as a higher priority than others

2342 2018-10-27 13:32:19 IOC trading at a dividend yield of 16%. Many Nifty 50 stocks trading at a dividend yield of more than bank FD yields.
Even in 2008 crash, I do not remember any Nifty 50 stock trading at such valuations.

2344 2018-10-27 13:30:48 Imo when not where. Not a chance before election after trumps attacks. Powell was clearly seeking neutral. Fed now targets financial conditions. Stocks and housing both down on year, continuing QT now nuts. But after election, IMHO.

2350 2018-10-27 13:25:52 Volatility. Our own stock market is the biggest bubble in history. Tech stocks are grossly overvalued and now far more volatile than bitcoin.

2354 2018-10-27 13:22:40 The stock market is taking a beating. Remember this - human emotion ruins investing returns. If you're young, stocks just went on sale. Cheaper to buy. #stocks #Investing #money
2355 2018-10-27 13:20:48 Yes. I really do hope that BigHit doesn't go public any time soon. There's no reason for them to; the company doesn't need the influx of cash from selling stocks. Going public also means giving up the creative and administrative freedoms that made #BTS the supergroup it is now.
2356 2018-10-27 13:19:21 Bertie A's legal point is ok, but he forgets distinction between local stocks and shared stocks.Iceland  has the first, UK mostly the last. The legal situation is that UK decide access to UK waters but is obliged (UNCLOS) to negotiate sharing. Zonal or historic is not prescribed
2357 2018-10-27 13:18:23 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
2358 2018-10-27 13:17:23 Can anyone educate me on stocks and investing?  
2359 2018-10-27 13:15:30 been already infected  couldn‘t sleep last night because of that and checked where and how to trade on penny stocks.. it‘s AMAZING potential in there!!
2360 2018-10-27 13:15:29 @latha_venkatesh China is down 60 percent from peak, Japan hasn’t revisited its 40 year old highs. European markets hovering around old levels. These are indices leave aside stocks god only knows what happened with them
2361 2018-10-27 13:12:53 With stocks in near free fall, and currencies volatile, major geopolitical instabilities in the Middle and Far East is it wise for the UK to be breaking away from a major market, irritating the nearest neighbours and adding instability to an already precarious economy? #brexit.
2362 2018-10-27 13:11:44 Your trading real stocks?? Haha

2365 2018-10-27 13:11:10 Je crois que c’est juste en attendant que les stocks reviennent
2366 2018-10-27 13:05:40 They moved more into stocks since Q2, so they lost a ton of money. Geniuses.
2367 2018-10-27 13:05:37 The fact is that remains in whether we are in particular 10 stocks or in remaining 1500 stocks.
2368 2018-10-27 13:05:03 To save pennies people watch TV everyday in the morning just to avoid doing analysis themselves and ended up losing tons of money in stupid stocks. Bravo that’s indian retail investors for u.

2372 2018-10-27 13:03:35 @monikahalan hello ma'am, am I right, if I chose to invest in 2 product stocks which are the only products in the market, say Colgate n pepsodent. Bought both the shares in equal amount thinking if one would dip the other must rise considering they are necessary product.thanks.
2373 2018-10-27 13:02:37 Things changed on a dime then for crude same will happen with equity. Look at NBFC’s they were darling and now everybody throwing them away in a month as everything changed for them. Clearly it seems either people knew a lot before they didn’t speak because stocks were going up

2389 2018-10-27 12:48:34 Some of the stuff I couldn’t figure out what was on there. I think one had stocks & shares flashing up 
2390 2018-10-27 12:48:25 PROOF PLEASE! Don’t say Taxes because that’s not true(ONLY FOR THE RICH) , don’t say regulations because it was (ONLY FOR THE RICH) don’t say stock market because it’s more like unpredictable than ever and (POOR PEOPLE DONT HAVE STOCKS) I could go on for days and he’s a (RACIST!)
2391 2018-10-27 12:47:30 My corn stocks came down last night. Oh the humanity.
2392 2018-10-27 12:47:20 I would add jspl at 160, yes bank -180, future consumer 41, Voda idea -35, spicejet - 70,v2 retail -290, Prakash and -102..I am betting on these stocks.
2393 2018-10-27 12:46:17 I may need help w/this. 1)Trickle down economics is a Republican policy, tried over and over. It’s proven not to work. Wages stay stagnant while stocks are inflated. 2)Republicans are out to destroy Social Security and Medicare;programs some of us have paid into for 40-50 yrs.
2394 2018-10-27 12:44:02 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
2395 2018-10-27 12:42:17 Invest in Stocks and crypto
2396 2018-10-27 12:39:10 Are they trying to sell all existing stocks before all people realise it’s a scam?
2397 2018-10-27 12:39:02 Can we short stocks?  
2398 2018-10-27 12:38:36 Hmmm...my stocks are looking good.
2399 2018-10-27 12:37:52 Central banks are printing debt to buy stocks and pump the markets. The next recession could be worst because it may also impact fiat currencies.
2400 2018-10-27 12:37:18 Trump should buy a few stocks. Tariffs are terrorizing the stock market.
2401 2018-10-27 12:36:21 Would be funny if it weren’t so sad AND dangerous. Stocks tanking, two miles of new boarder fence, MAGA lunatics sending bombs, skyrocketing deficit fueled by government spending.....enough.
VOTE BLUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2402 2018-10-27 12:35:10 I guess that's what Trump and his cult means by "winning". 
His plutocrats are already richer than any human should be, stocks dropping is for them just an opportunity to buy the one's losing out so they can further bolster their fortune.
Sounds like victory to a plutocrat to me.
2403 2018-10-27 12:33:02 In this respect, therefore, the species became adapted to their aboriginal stocks.
2404 2018-10-27 12:33:00 Yes of course they are, champions arnt they. If Benbatl could win with some consistency at even G2 or G3 your argument would hold water but even then he struggles. One thing Benbatl & Blair House have shown us is that outside of our champion mare our WFA stocks are pretty average
2405 2018-10-27 12:31:46 How does one based here buy stocks there?
2406 2018-10-27 12:31:31 Time to sell these Amazon stocks after this bounce back up.
2407 2018-10-27 12:30:25 My mentor put me on to making private investments in stocks and financially the turnaround of the outcome has been rewarding.  Best financial move yet. Invest, trust me.
2408 2018-10-27 12:30:18 In short all of these are people’s success ? i’ll check it out also, if you interested can check out ‘day trading 101’ if you interested in stocks and investments.
2409 2018-10-27 12:30:16 Weed stocks are the future my dudes get in now while they’re in the dip.
2410 2018-10-27 12:29:35 We got overbought mid January. Sentiment was bullish from thanksgiving. and mid january was when the majority of stocks stopped going up.
2411 2018-10-27 12:28:24 What are you buying? Garbage doesn’t produce returns. The job market is flourishing. Even in this market, you can buy more stocks. There are many great balance sheets and opportunities thanks to the Trump policy. The data centre of my company relocated to the USA
2412 2018-10-27 12:28:21 Favorite ice cream. We have a shoppe here that only stocks Giffords, always busy.
2413 2018-10-27 12:27:34 Video games are actually a pretty stable investment. A lot of people buy games as an investment or to flip on in the short/medium term. So much like stocks, if more are released, it reduces your holding of the total available, thus reducing their value.

2415 2018-10-27 12:22:43 @ShutUp the NYHILO index suggests stocks making new lows are decreasing
2416 2018-10-27 12:17:58 What's the stocks look like????
2417 2018-10-27 12:13:29 Hey everyone.
The Newly released game, Red dead redemption on ps4 for only $79.99 
So come in while stocks last only at gametrades Salisbury.
2418 2018-10-27 12:12:08 Why??? Because they report what he says and does?
The only reason it is negative is because he does it and says it!!! Name one positive thing he has done and don't say the economy. Mass deficit to line pockets of rich and now stocks are tanking and inflation rising.
2419 2018-10-27 12:12:07 Funny how the only homie  with the same money making interests (stocks/investing)  as me lives in  a big city. I need that atmosphere.
2420 2018-10-27 12:11:51 En premier je ferais des stocks de bouffe, nan j'dec. Plus sérieusement, déjà dans mon état j'achèterai un new PC et un clavier, là c'est la desh à l'ancienne... Et si y'a du reste, ça part sur hypixel, des dons à des associations, (à Bosnie), du mattos en tout genre, habits...
2421 2018-10-27 12:11:47 Madam. Am no expert on these (not that I claim expertise in stocks!). 
There are acknowledged experts like @deepakshenoy and @Prashanth_Krish here.
They may help you out
2422 2018-10-27 12:10:09 Hi, can you please help with how can I buy American stocks from Nigeria? Ang ideas on platforms that do that?
2423 2018-10-27 12:09:15 then stocks should be pricing that in too. i think narrative is what we should have heard in aug/sept but spx was high so no one used it. remember how slow was okay?
2424 2018-10-27 12:07:05 @George_Osborne @DavidCameron_MP both of these pricks should be hounded out and put in stocks
2425 2018-10-27 12:05:32 dia kata limited stocks. aku agak mesti dah nak habis. sempat ke esok 
2426 2018-10-27 12:05:19 Very nice input. This is time to buy and add on few stocks. Once clear govt is at centre then see returns.
2427 2018-10-27 12:03:50 Stocks, investment. Real estate, investment. Video games? for fun, to collect. If you buy @LimitedRunGames just to make a profit, there are other vehicles that are much more effective. Easy access to games is in every gamers best interest.
2428 2018-10-27 11:54:23 Hey, saw your video on TOS. I’d suggest rather than focusing on Penny Stocks you learn Options trading. There is a lot of minipulation in Penny Stocks (pump ‘n dumps everywhere). Options on large cap stocks have even MORE volatility, and can behave more consistently.
2429 2018-10-27 11:54:01 I really think that if the market goes any lower that money will start flowing out of bio. The talking heads are already telling people to start looking at “Quality Stocks”. We all know that bios for the most part are like buying lottery tickets. I am a spectator for a while.
2430 2018-10-27 11:53:31 A pretty good rule of thumb is that by the time people realize we are in a recession most of the damage to stocks will have already been done.
2431 2018-10-27 11:53:09 The manipulators of the markets,especially the central banks,will start unwinding their short positions against miners soon,this will cause a spring shock up in commodity prices and miners.I expect a 200 to 400% rise in mining stocks and in uranium,gold,silver over a 6 to 18 mnth
2432 2018-10-27 11:49:50 Just some of our marine stocks.....all at fantastic prices!

$INTC maybe? outside week up

really not seeing much...many more look like shorts

2455 2018-10-27 11:25:33 Lo de que un vendedor no trate bien a un cliente no me entra en la cabeza. Por eso ese maltrato del que hablas creo que viene justificado en muchas ocasiones por el almacén que controla la rotación de los stocks y Customer Service que procesa pedidos. Tal cual.
2456 2018-10-27 11:25:22 Sir they haven’t been investing in markets for last ten years only. Since 2013-14 they have made tons rupee was 69 and 64 till September. Don’t forget that as well. They have tons of stocks and that too blue chip ones not the Lala cos. There stocks have outperformed like anything

#sensex & #nifty are actually badly managed portfolios. The MAIN thing working in their favour is recent momentum & stocks of industry leaders only. 

Strange to see MOST fund managers struggle to beat 2 badly managed portfolios! 


2471 2018-10-27 11:08:46 How’s that stock market helping the majority of Americans, the tax scam enriching corps who are buying stocks back rather than reinsvesting, tariffs bankrupting farmers and job layoffs.

2473 2018-10-27 11:02:47 You have to stop reading the NYT and watching CNN. Try the WSJ every once in a while Stocks sense 2016 have gone up ~50%. This is called profit taking. Prices are going up mainly do to economic growth and interest rate hikes. Debt grew ~16x faster under Obama.

2484 2018-10-27 10:58:07 most inv today do not believe stocks go down. 2017 was a lie CB created by saving every day of the year for equity inv. The trolls you mentioned who got into the markets after 2016 will learn a hard lesson. Stay stubborn, stay in, burn hard.

2504 2018-10-27 10:41:23 You are smart enough to know the answer. I think that people are starting to think about more realistic values. Whatever those are. In a panic, more and more stocks will have NO VALUE. The talking heads are starting to tell people to put their money into “Quality stocks”.

We either have a large recession if rate hikes continue or stocks fall so much they cancel a rate hike then we have stagflation.

Both are correct for either assumption but now ask what's the length of a Fed board member? 14 years.

2601 2018-10-27 09:03:35 "If you're right about the business, you'll make a lot of money, so don't bother about attempting to buy stocks based on how their stock charts have looked over the past 200 days."

2603 2018-10-27 09:00:05 Simple you cant follow a person's or Stocks Broker's advice and invest in a company.

If you know the reason behind your investment,then you know when to exit from the same.

Both are important.

Its not a place for easy mny

2607 2018-10-27 08:58:22 At the core of Warren Buffett's investment philosophy is value investing. 
This actually means to identify high quality companies whose stocks are trading at a lower price than should be.
2608 2018-10-27 08:58:02 And when we view investments in stocks as tangible businesses we have an ownership stake in, one headline or some tough few months shouldn't change our opinion on the business itself." says Warren Buffett.
2609 2018-10-27 08:55:23 Agreed. There are no certainties in life just odds. There is no guarantee that your money in the bank will be worth as much in 5 years or that it will be there at all. Same for real estate, stocks, precious metals etc. Wherever you park your money it's a bet.
2610 2018-10-27 08:55:23 Investment thesis should be the simple one.The more simple it is, the more better it will be.

2671 2018-10-27 07:44:22 Thanks for your message .This is exactly the purpose of Zambala Stocks for the retail investors to know the performance track record of market experts. So far this was hidden from the eyes of investors and they had blindly invested/traded  money on bad advisory.

2673 2018-10-27 07:43:12 The more I think about it, the more I disagree with your position. If MMJ stocks are overvalued against their profits, it’s because smart investors are betting on upside, getting ground floor. MJ is hyperprofitable, real value. It’s shaking out.

2712 2018-10-27 06:46:16 Swiss Alps Energy began as a concept for rewarding and celebrating knowledge. Everyone possesses knowledge, but opportunities to share, showcase, and receive the benefit of one’s own knowledge can be scarce for most people. #SAMTokens #Swissalpsmining #finance #stocks #altcoin

2716 2018-10-27 06:43:12 The gains in the gold stocks will dwarf the FAANG stocks. Volume is low  in this sector. Wait until the market realizes bonds are what they are  and it will become normal again for asset/fund/pension managers to allocate  more than a fraction of a percent to gold stocks.

Ok when they get calls right over 1 year, but when they don’t, it’s underperformance = fundamental problem with active management. This article doesn’t actually explain how they’re any different

2731 2018-10-27 06:24:57 Gm, my immature question is if an Index is a composite of stocks with different weightage. Stocks movement reflects on index. Then how is it done that dumping stock and pumping index at the same time ? Or you are talking index future price ! Thanks :)

2735 2018-10-27 06:22:41 When bonds yield 2%, it takes somewhere between 36 and 49 years to double your money depending on if / how you compound it. When bonds yield 5%, it's between 14 and 19. At 10%, between 7 and 9 years. 

Compare this to a stock's PE, and you'll see a real problem brewing for stocks
2736 2018-10-27 06:19:27 It happenend due to rebalancing of portfolios made mandatory by Sebi. Money moved from midcap to large cap, insulating large caps in general. Even in large caps money into very small pockets. When we buy 6lkcr mcap stocks lot of money gets absorbed.

2757 2018-10-27 06:00:44 Depends on the model. If you allow every dev to own a % of the game (akin to issuing stocks for it) or in the studio, they will be a lot more inclined to stay and continue investing their time and energy. The difference is it'll actually be fair.

2767 2018-10-27 05:42:36 Should have been clearer. $GOOGL is a best of all time business. I grouped BKNG (a great business) with GOOGL as the other stocks on the list have significant uncertainties that make $BKNG a better risk return in my opinion.
2768 2018-10-27 05:41:41 Well said. Public servants, an Antiquated name for politicians, should not be leaving office wealthier than when they went in, unless their stocks are making them money.

2776 2018-10-27 05:30:33 I’m thinking that maybe Trump was chosen as the fall guy for what is to come. Trump the candidate said that stocks were in a bubble. Trump the president has taken credit for the stock rise during his term. Trump’s not stupid so this seems like intentional stupidity and acting.
2777 2018-10-27 05:30:22 Yeah the difference is huge. It's like playing poker with the softest table possible, while trading stocks has mostly sharks on every table.

2791 2018-10-27 05:12:43 Most people are afraid of stocks but it's almost the most profitable as it is the riskiest. 
I would/should have invested in crypto like 4years back, doing it now takes a lot of studying and assessment but still good and then financial instruments...
2792 2018-10-27 05:12:06 Why no buying bse listed stocks?
2793 2018-10-27 05:11:46 I think slavery was a bad example and too sensitive to touch on but the basis is niggas got choices to learn about stocks instead of packs knowing the prison system is slavery but still do dumb shit.
2794 2018-10-27 05:09:54 Interesting view, this would be a contra play?
Stocks which are going up get sold, 
stocks declining would be bought

DSP Equal Nifty 50 Fund  is an option but short history (~1 yr) makes comparisons difficult

2800 2018-10-27 04:55:13 Fund managers recommended stocks even when they were highly overvalued, to keep their AUM intact and receive fund management fees. Warning signals were ringing but they ignored the same for their selfish ends and are now searching for scapegoats.
2801 2018-10-27 04:51:51 Think of it this way: _everything_ the gov't does today is funded by deficit spending. Taxes can be analogous to a stock buy back, made to offset the diluted shares. In this analogy, the $ are the stocks, and the taxes offset the inflation. Incredibly, taxes do not fund our gov't
2802 2018-10-27 04:51:36 We are litterally just sitting here playing melee. Then, you changed the stocks after "winning" a game.
2803 2018-10-27 04:51:28 We have a Bad Tendency to Look portfolio daily.When a person Buys stock it is for either short term or long.Those who bought for long should not watch on daily basis as he/she will screw themselves.  Old people use to buy stocks and forgot for years , They got good appreciation
2804 2018-10-27 04:50:58 Trump was always saying there will be so much winning under him, people would get tired of winning.
Well the stocks going up was short lived so this guys sister lost everything she gained and than some. So no more winning for her.

2813 2018-10-27 04:43:39 Very well overall since President Trump took office. The Dow was 19,800 when he was sworn in..and it’s sitting at 24,600 today, right? I invest almost exclusively in stocks in my retirement accounts (to catch up), so yeah, doing pretty well.

2816 2018-10-27 04:41:09 Taxes on Capital Gain from Stocks should be increased to flat 25% (fillers and Non-fillers). This will encourage long-term investment and less speculative short-term investments. @econofpak @Asad_Umar @Hammad_Azhar #psx #kse #kse100 #kse30

2834 2018-10-27 04:23:44 What's your opinion of $JNUG and junior mining stocks in general?
2835 2018-10-27 04:21:15 Good graphics to show people's normal reactions to retirement planning. However, if you invest small amounts in carefully thought out stocks every year from younger years, it would take care of retirement.

Having said that would it be a good idea to track or Buy stocks where FIIs have increased their stake in the September quarter? Thanks.
2845 2018-10-27 04:13:04 Dear @FBI 
The wall street action didn't believe one iota of your story about the bomb maker once you presented your evidence, Wall street made up their minds and said this is not believable. Positive briefly then when the evidence presented stocks went lower.
2846 2018-10-27 04:11:52 Hmm.,

Globally, Asian shares dived on Thursday as hundreds of billions of dollars bled from the global markets after a rout in tech stocks inflicted the largest daily decline on Wall Street since 2011, wiping out all its gains for the year.

2847 2018-10-27 04:11:22 Fear - there is no source of alpha in large caps 

Can Nifty stocks do better than Nifty itself 

May be yes - history shows Equal Weight Nifty (2 % in each company)  over long period does better than market cap weighted Nifty 

Why-blend of size effect & rebalancing back to 2 %
2848 2018-10-27 04:10:37 lot of out of stocks on some of the bigger moms
2849 2018-10-27 04:09:49 If you study stocks from all 75 u will really find few of them will be huge multibagger in next few years. Need to have vision and art to find them, it’s in front of you only, just need to hold them with conviction and confidence.
2850 2018-10-27 04:09:24 DOW is net negative for the year. It's not lost on anyone who is invested in the market. All year, the number of stocks that one could credibly make gains in has dwindled. A bad week next week will kill the GOP in suburban districts.
2851 2018-10-27 04:08:13 
2852 2018-10-27 04:07:25 Market is going down everyday..and stocks as well...portfolio could be 30-40% down, if I have conviction and can take risk..will hold long term portfolio and will not dilute.
1/3
2853 2018-10-27 04:07:16 That perhaps this was just some way to get stocks at bargain basement prices. Who knows? Only time and patience has the answer to this!

2857 2018-10-27 03:58:13 I just read a stat the other day that said something like 58% of Americans have money in the stock market. 

There are people dying of need every day, yet half of you have extra money to gamble on stocks...
2858 2018-10-27 03:57:26 Sheeples.   Why are these stocks hot again?
2859 2018-10-27 03:55:56 12 BILLION dollars paid out of OUR pockets to fix his ego driven bad deals. 
And he's "makes the best deals"??? 
Stock market just lost every gain he claimed was becuase of him. So stocks = $0 tariffs = - $12 BILLION.
As usual he's bankrupting whatever he touches.
2860 2018-10-27 03:54:49 What’s the current odds he sticks to this call once stocks are up 20%
2861 2018-10-27 03:54:02 A well balanced portfolio should include:

1. Diversified Blue Chip Stocks. 

2. Real Estate. 

3. PRO Forex Traders with proven track records!
2862 2018-10-27 03:52:53 Thank you. I'm getting by. My point is that there are 10's of thousands of us in the same situation here and all the Republicans want to talk about is how well the stock market is doing. I don't care. I don't own stocks.
2863 2018-10-27 03:52:49 Looks like I sold 50% of stocks just in time. 2,3 weeks later, everything starts tanking.

2868 2018-10-27 03:49:02 Don’t lie!!! You don’t have the money to buy stocks. Your agent fired you 
2869 2018-10-27 03:48:17 If you think crypto will rally in 2019, the black swan event is a recession where stocks drop >10% and crypto drops sharply.

A leveraged put option (or short) on the S&P500 could hedge against a long crypto position.

It would give fresh capital to buy crypto after a deep cut.
2870 2018-10-27 03:45:56 And no I wasn’t, I need corrections  so I can make money. There are particular stocks that I buy low sell high repeatedly

2872 2018-10-27 03:43:44 I need to see some settlement with tariffs between China, an actual bottom in tech stocks, high probability setups chartwise etc. These things need to align... when these things occur that's when a higher level trader makes the majority of their profits

2874 2018-10-27 03:41:58 Prayers up! What if the only way to make $$ is day trading pot stocks? Thought makes me laugh 
2875 2018-10-27 03:40:29 today I learned a lesson, dream & black magic are the factors to earn profits from purchasing stocks 
2876 2018-10-27 03:40:05 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2877 2018-10-27 03:40:05 Joe Sakic and Don Sweeney were the laughing stocks of the league when GMs like MB, Pierre Dorion and Stan Bowman were seen as some of the best in the league. It’s a shitshow, with very few signs of consistency.
2878 2018-10-27 03:38:33 Boi all I do with extra money is play with stocks these days...  I'm gonna be retired when I'm 37-40. Mark my words.
2879 2018-10-27 03:36:17 Aside from still being jet-lagged (waking early every morn...), one week on, so far so good. Pleased to see good stocks of Cava here.

2890 2018-10-27 03:30:12 Yeh, I’m a pro gun liberal and your stance on guns is too extreeme. No one needs bump stocks, and your no vote on that was just to keep the fringe happy. Raising the Minimum wage in Oregon resulted in a spending boom, the data supports raising it.

2908 2018-10-27 03:05:26 Obama created more jobs in his last 18 months than Trump in his  first 18. Stocks are now in correction territory. 5 straight weeks of losses. Trump got  <10% of vote in Manhattan, his home for 40+ years. Because they know what a phony he is.

2921 2018-10-27 02:54:24 There is no evidence of this hypothetical situation being peddled by twitter “experts.” Why on Earth would risk averse investors take their money out of stocks and shares and place them in a market that has an intraday velocity equal to the annual velocity of traditional markets?

2925 2018-10-27 02:53:13 I was so upset in July of 17 when I had to liquidate all my stocks, including Facebook at $155 or so, in order to buy my first home. I’m not so upset anymore. Lol
2926 2018-10-27 02:50:04 I read an article somewhere  about an actual bull picking stocks. Now I can’t find it but I seen it
2927 2018-10-27 02:50:04 I’m so sick of you and your bump stocks. Why don’t you bump off.
2928 2018-10-27 02:49:58 hunting?  your dad @realDonaldTrump (who is disappointed in you) lied about @GOP putting in a tax cut for middle income families. tariffs are hitting corporations’ bottom lines. stocks way down. sides with khashoggi’s killers. and still attacks the media
2929 2018-10-27 02:49:56 25 days ago “Don’t Boo” Heller (R-Adelson) celebrated one year of doing absolutely nothing about assault weapons, bump stocks, background checks for domestic abusers, the mentally ill,even terrorists. America’s most mediocre senator couldn’t even react to a Nevadan tragedy.

2935 2018-10-27 02:39:29 It is making it very difficult to find stocks to invest. I think I will seat and wait it out. Too much chop.

2940 2018-10-27 02:34:54 Sounds more to me like he's not hunting for this strategy but instead he has charts with the stocks in play open, and if one of the strategies on his playbook manifests on any of the charts, he will take the market's gift

People shouldn't buy lottery tickets or trade stocks.
I read a blackjack book where the intro says this book will make the casinos more money because you will start playing before you are good enough. You can win but it is HARD WORK.

2987 2018-10-27 01:48:33 As of today... Stocks (401Ks) hit all time record highs over 20 times since Jan. 2017. Will be much higher as spending season starts and retailers stocks boost averages that 401ks based on
2988 2018-10-27 01:47:23 I'm not even going to go down that path!  just going to focus on organizing my own stocks.
2989 2018-10-27 01:46:15 Past returns averaged a perfect zero. Good accuracy there in picking stocks to balance the returns.
2990 2018-10-27 01:42:31 Gauruntee as soon as I move out my mums stocks up the fridge big time and that does not sit well with me
2991 2018-10-27 01:41:39 If this drops to 50 I'm buying four stocks lol. If I lose the money whatever. But I just think WWE is gunna be around longer then me. Good investment.
2992 2018-10-27 01:40:07 That was the top actually,  problem is retail investors won't know when many of folks who recommended stocks sold out and turned bearish.
2993 2018-10-27 01:39:55 Hi Chonis whats your gut feeling. I personally feel with strong dollar and increase in interest rates as well as overpriced tech stocks we could be heading further down. this will scare people with world economies slowing
2994 2018-10-27 01:36:32 Most people shouldn't watch financial media, shouldn't follow anyone on FinTwit, shouldn't read RM, shouldn't pick stocks, shouldn't follow the stock market and don't have the ability to intelligently "decide for themselves". The empirical evidence is very clear on this.
2995 2018-10-27 01:35:49 Look at INDUSTRY PERFORMANCE as a % S&P500 Stocks as an additional potential Correlation and if it can be traced to Debt 1, 2, 3 years prior...
2996 2018-10-27 01:35:06 So apparently the new move is investing in Chinese stocks and I’m totally for it... even tho you don’t have too, does any one speak mandarin that wants to make some big mooola?
2997 2018-10-27 01:33:20 Why should he. They all have called for violence against him and Republican MAGA SUPPORTERS! Heck a Lefty Shot Scalise and tried killing all Republicans and the DEMS AND MEDIA SAID THEY DESERVED IT! MEDIA PARENT STOCKS OWNED BY CHINA. TREASON???
2998 2018-10-27 01:31:48 if i come up on some dinero, I’m shooting my shot with someone famous. im trynna invest in you and some stocks 
2999 2018-10-27 01:30:46 These positive readings Wall Street has shown are false readings.
Stocks are being manipulated to make it look good.
But to one with open eyes.
They can see the truth..
We are headed right for another economic desaster ..
Another result of Republican economics..Trickle down Joke.
3000 2018-10-27 01:30:31 Lmao couldn't agree more. I also trade. Mostly options but also stocks

3002 2018-10-27 01:30:03 I don't think about financial success as the measurement of my success. #tradeforex #stocks

3006 2018-10-27 01:26:29 Your targets achieved in both the stocks mentioned. Infact Bandhan has gone beyond far lower. It seems market is listening to you. Can please ask her to change the course????
3007 2018-10-27 01:24:00 Alexa order me 100 stocks in pornhub
3008 2018-10-27 01:23:39 $ACB 
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd of sold those calls that hurt your bottom line...
And you'd stay
I don't know why I didnt sell them
I don't know why I kept the calls I kept. Stocks are like a knife it can cut deep inside
Dips are like weapons, they wound
3009 2018-10-27 01:22:56 I still think the next 6 months will be chaotic, with lots of volatility. But as the market stabilizes and producers can start to predict trends and address problems, the companies will start to become as reliable as most mainstream stocks.
3010 2018-10-27 01:18:52 Raised taxes CAN'T result in employee investment and lowered prices.  So it looks like there's only one choice.  Big Pharma is a monopoly created by government intervention/subsidies/regulations.  People don't need "disposable income" to invest.  There are penny stocks
3011 2018-10-27 01:18:06 Most people buy when they see green! 

We all should do constant SIPs of weekly, monthly in our good fundamental stocks! 
But be aware of latest news in the company and corporate governance!
3012 2018-10-27 01:18:03 We love  Trish ! Don’t worry Everybody voting Republican !!You’ve  earned that glass of wine tonight. I’d go either Caymas 2014 or if the stocks got you alittle pissed off then “ FOLIE a Deux “ it’s a real mood changer !
3013 2018-10-27 01:17:52 All these libs eating up the details on this package bomber dude being a Trump humper. Yet the Vegas shooter a year ago was a Hillary supporter, and no one uttered a peep about that. It was all about bump stocks and gun control.

Psychopathy is on both sides of the aisle, fokls
3014 2018-10-27 01:17:44 Those stocks are too ghetto
3015 2018-10-27 01:17:24 Again, you assert things that aren't true or are only true to a degree.
Most Americans don't have the disposable income to buy stocks.
Buybacks CAN result in employee investment & lowered prices - or not.
Big Pharma is a perfect example of profits accruing only to shareholders.
3016 2018-10-27 01:16:56 Is the saying stocks go sideways at the top and commodities go sideways on the bottom true?
3017 2018-10-27 01:16:11 Manufacturing isn’t back, coal isn’t back, economy is sustained for the short term, even if were already seeing the effects of his plan starting to crumble the stocks...give it two - 4 more years and will be back in the “second Great Depression” Bush left us in.
3018 2018-10-27 01:16:07 And basically anyone who has entered even legally from Mexico/ Latino to get the hell out of America. Say goodbye to your healthcare coverage too. But hey all the stocks you own your making $$ on the great stockmarket

3027 2018-10-27 01:10:12 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
3028 2018-10-27 01:09:42 Why tf our stocks look good on EVERYTHING but our car 
3029 2018-10-27 01:09:15 That is one of the more ridiculous comparisons between two stocks Ive seen of late. $IHL is a distributor of existing cannabidiol products. $BOT is a Phase 2 biotech developing novel dermal applications to treat a wide variety of skin conditions using cannabidiol.
3030 2018-10-27 01:08:38 @Rossi4life I heard that you invest in penny stocks Uncle Shaun. I got a good company that's gonna be on the rise in the next couple of months if you want the details! (I have a stock activity in my finance class so I've been researching into this stuff and this is gonna boom!)
3031 2018-10-27 01:08:22 The only one of my stocks that didn't nosedive was McDonalds... proving it's basically a cockroach.  #ImNotLovinIt

3041 2018-10-27 00:59:55 The fuck is that? Never heard of it! Is it for traditional stocks
3042 2018-10-27 00:59:42 A few days ago on @FoxBusiness they were discussing MJ stocks. A guest said they were looking at bars in Las Vegas where patrons could buy a drink & smoke weed. They should invest in Uber to drive those drunk/high folks home.

But cigs are a no-no!
3043 2018-10-27 00:58:28 @P1nky well, they allowed me to make unlimited day trades, so i rode stocks like $AQB and $MNGA for like 10-15cents, sold off..and then

3046 2018-10-27 00:51:42 Friends, how many people here understand how the stock market elites work? They love to cause the market to go up and down alot. Just like a yo-yo. They prey on people with not much money. They cause the prices of key stocks to fall to cause a panic.

3048 2018-10-27 00:50:14 alan: kids these days, they all learn communism too young

alina: i started to call myself a socialist when i was young

alan: but do you know how stocks work

all of us: no!! hahahahaha
3049 2018-10-27 00:50:00 What is going on is no accident. Cause the market to go down enough to get people to panic and sell. then swoop in and buy their stocks at a much lower price. Then watch the stocks go back up. This is how the rich get richer. Too many people panic and lose big.
3050 2018-10-27 00:48:28 @staceyabrams Do you know what assault weapons are? They are classified as fully automatic weapons and they are already federally banned, bump stocks have been banned by executive order already so it’s virtually impossible to make a semi auto an assault weapon now
3051 2018-10-27 00:48:16 I myself don’t favor burning heretics at the stake but a few days in the stocks never hurt anyone
3052 2018-10-27 00:47:45 but there was no correlation for years on end, the entire chart assumes there is now when all this chart does is divide btc price by spx points. naturally if stocks slide this goes up, if stocks gain this goes down. thats a huge fucking assumption charting this, no?
3053 2018-10-27 00:46:59 Cost plays a critical component in total return, whether it's from actively or passively managed investments. Many investors have started to realize this and recognize that keeping investment costs low gives them the opportunity to hold on to more returns.#OnlineTrading #Stocks
3054 2018-10-27 00:46:52 Well, I was close. Next couple of weeks will be fun as we puke out all the crap stocks posing as companies.
3055 2018-10-27 00:46:08 myflo: if you were president what would the stock market be like
me: let me think out loud. i would get everyone working at least a little bit even if just from home so salaries would decrease due to shared responsibilities and companies would earn more so stocks would go up
3056 2018-10-27 00:45:53 Ouch, tough day for Amazon. Lost $68 billion in market cap in a single day. Jeff Bezos probably also not too happy with an $11 billion hit to his net worth. #investments #stocks #Amazon
3057 2018-10-27 00:45:52 Radicalized by Trump's hate speech. Domestic terrorist. Trump's creepiness is now affecting everything. Big businesses are now reporting losses due to the tariffs. Bank stocks sinking bec of rising interest rates. And now BOMBS.

3073 2018-10-27 00:37:50 Anyone who has zero or minimal experience in trading or investing in whatever financial instruments such as stocks and foreign currencies cannot be expected to clearly explain what derivatives and hedging instruments are.
3074 2018-10-27 00:37:42 The bull market hasn’t helped everyone. Just over half of people (54%) actually own stocks, which includes individual stocks, as well as employer-sponsored 401(k) plans, mutual funds or an IRA account. And two-thirds of Americans don’t have access to a 401(k) plan.

3077 2018-10-27 00:35:06 I will say too, I think there’s legit wealth effect concerns at play here. With housing and auto weakness in play already what happens if you see severe market deterioration. Having 100s of billions come out the fangs + housing/home/auto related stocks completely tanks is bad
3078 2018-10-27 00:34:45 The guy who went into the bathroom ahead of me just now was trading stocks on his phone as he walked in. I stood behind him waiting on the urinal, and he was...multi-tasking, if you catch my drift.

3088 2018-10-27 00:26:37 Keynesian economics does not get to the root of the economic recovery. The tech stocks were overvalued, the stock market took a hit, it is time to invest in the blue chip stocks that were dragged down. It is time to invest in the blue chip stocks! Senator Casey makes me ill.

3116 2018-10-26 23:56:55 HOW is life better? Because there’s a Republican President? He isn’t actually responsible for jobs. Companies who got tax breaks bought back stocks. That’s why he’s promising a middle class tax break by Election Day but Congress is recessed so no go.
3117 2018-10-26 23:56:06 Worries about a slowdown in corporate sales, and that companies have reached peak earnings growth, have been weighing on the markets for a couple of weeks and are behind Friday's selloff in #stocks
3118 2018-10-26 23:55:03 One good thing can happen if the market enters bear territory:  Stocks will reset their base counts with fresh lease to run up.
3119 2018-10-26 23:55:01 Personally, I don’t like the ooil exposure of the pump stocks fls and xyl, but water infrastructure is horribly outdated and in fairly dire need of refit
3120 2018-10-26 23:52:46 I’m excited because I don’t know of anywhere in Preston that currently stocks @KiehlsUKI
3121 2018-10-26 23:52:18 High yield stocks and funds are great for generating income during retirement.
3122 2018-10-26 23:50:55 You is cute bunny! Not sure you deserve to be in stocks though. Maybe it's a reward?
3123 2018-10-26 23:49:39 Massive private and public debt. The dominance of the FIRE sector, huge income inequality, speculative borrowing for over valued stocks and housing. Ridiculous P/E ratios. How long can this last? I think you are correct Peter.
3124 2018-10-26 23:49:38 WWE's stocks have fallen almost 29 points since September 28th. Some of that's just general downward trending, but not all of it. Maybe that bubble's already bursting.
3125 2018-10-26 23:49:14 The #stockmarket may be testing the idea that the #TaxCut resulted in a mirage in prices due to buy-backs and M&A. If so, we'll have to see Jan 2017 prices before correction is over. In other words,  $AMZN and $AAPL are NOT growth stocks. Just sayin'.
3126 2018-10-26 23:46:28 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your bipolar disorder
3127 2018-10-26 23:45:39 So, you think investors will flee bank stocks to buy bitcoin, which is down 70%+ in one year? Crypto should be melting up on huge volume this week, but it isn’t...what does that tell you?
3128 2018-10-26 23:45:06 Morning sir.
Pwd po magtanong.
What are "voting rights"  that come with common stocks po?
Tnx 
God bless.
3129 2018-10-26 23:44:38 A gun free zone doesn’t mean shit. Background checks, restricting purchases for those on no-fly zones, ban bump stocks. 80-90% of Americans support. Renacci doesn’t. Enough said. NRA owns.
3130 2018-10-26 23:43:35 Here is a list of my largest positions in order, along with my cost basis.

I'll talk a little bit in my next post about temperament when stocks take a hit.
3131 2018-10-26 23:42:45 I would buy their stocks at this moment. 
3132 2018-10-26 23:42:09 On gun control - @SherrodBrown says parents shouldn't have to worry about their children's safety when they take them to school. He says common sense measures like banning bump stocks, universal background checks and not allowing ppl on terrorist no fly list to buy guns.
3133 2018-10-26 23:41:53 Agreed- I'll know things are serious when I see "Stocks Bitchslapped"

3152 2018-10-26 23:41:30 If you're a momentum trader you're going to look around for momo stocks that didn't get crushed this week

For that reason, I think $TSLA might be one of the best names to buy on dips moving forward. Momo players don't sit cash, they look for the hottest stock
3153 2018-10-26 23:40:17 *opens Alberta Liquor Connect app to see who stocks that out here*
3154 2018-10-26 23:40:11 Forget Amazon and Google, chip stocks are the problem, Barron’s article by @firstadopter nails it. Semi drawdown shows weakness in economy. Stock market will continue to reprice downwards.
3155 2018-10-26 23:39:35 I only plan to put long term money into stocks. I rarely need to sell. If I need money, I prefer to borrow money than to sell investments. When I see borrowing increasing, that's a signal to start cutting my budget.
3156 2018-10-26 23:39:31 So why are all the producer stocks down now? General market downdraft? My URA ETF stop loss hit...Sad! But still in FCU...
3157 2018-10-26 23:39:00 Will be officially investing in shares of the company I work at soon, will also be investing in stocks that make products my life partner and I use often, and will be voting and donating from here on. Never let others control your life without you having some say.
3158 2018-10-26 23:36:33 Stocks overvalued from company buyback and cheap government printed money.

Crypto undervalued even at ATH and now at really good prices.

Crypto will be the hedge and it will be the start of the real flippening.
3159 2018-10-26 23:36:02 I bought some small positions in a few new stocks today. I didn't sell any stocks today or in the last month. No plans to sell stocks anytime soon.
3160 2018-10-26 23:34:29 I’m excited for @KiehlsUKI to arrive because I don’t think anywhere else in Preston stocks it.
3161 2018-10-26 23:32:40 Chuck, it’s been more than a year since the Las Vegas massacre, give me one reason why bump stocks are still legal. Thanks.
3162 2018-10-26 23:31:42 That's a huge contraction, stocks are looking real good
3163 2018-10-26 23:31:20 I’m just glad I pulled my AFMD profits out if the market and out the cash to work instead of rolling into another stock(s).  I’m still green on the year, but down large in the stocks I’m holding
3164 2018-10-26 23:30:04 i’ve come too far pronouncing it “birking stocks” to turn back now, next up: chicargo and progrum
3165 2018-10-26 23:28:46 Stocks in the United States also have a hard time.
3166 2018-10-26 23:27:52 Stocks are over valued and 'fear' that interest rates will rise means exit from stocks. Not surprising at all.
3167 2018-10-26 23:23:38 Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with
a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten
forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.

Your own?
3168 2018-10-26 23:22:56 Anti union, privatization propaganda.  If the schools are not privatized then politicians can't hand out contracts,  and if they can't hand out contracts then they can't get kickbacks,  and thier stocks in Teach for America won't got up.
3169 2018-10-26 23:22:56 Have you ever played the stock market? Hot stocks come and go. That's how The Show works with their auction house - always has.
3170 2018-10-26 23:20:36 I am losing money in stocks
3171 2018-10-26 23:20:35 No. Oreo stocks.
3172 2018-10-26 23:20:07 I don’t think this is a correction, I think this is the start of the actual bear market for stocks. If you look at a lot of stock charts many of them have been in a distribution channel for a chunk of the year and have now broken down. Some are currently having a bearish retest.
3173 2018-10-26 23:17:59 Something milder than burning, which would be uncivilised for even us right wing troglodytes - a day in the stocks with comedy cabbage throwing for example - and the paper might be able to sell tickets.
3174 2018-10-26 23:13:55 I think American stocks will do well and remember lots of these companies will offer coins of their own on the block chain
3175 2018-10-26 23:12:52 Yes we knew it would be the Norman Vincent Peale presidency when things got tough. How's your stocks doing?
3176 2018-10-26 23:12:46 What a lier you are. Stocks are falling do to what is going on with trade and the way government is being run at this time.
3177 2018-10-26 23:11:04 Google it. It’s like buying stocks but with actual money and the price of it goes up and down. It’s also untraceable so people use it to buy drugs and other shit, but it’s also used for completely legitimate purposes too
3178 2018-10-26 23:10:42 qq são stocks free?
3179 2018-10-26 23:10:34 Fake like those of #Ian56, #PartisanGirl.. nothing but state sponsored censorship of dissenting voices.. Twitter stocks are owned my Saudi Arabia.
3180 2018-10-26 23:10:10 Invest in some stocks, put my name on a building
3181 2018-10-26 23:10:01 It’s the pizza parlor indicator when you should be fearful, when the random folk not in Wall Street business suits start talking about buying stocks.
3182 2018-10-26 23:09:44 How will the #Cryptocurrency market react to stocks crashing?
3183 2018-10-26 23:09:19 Yeah, no more stocks or VCP for Amazon employees
3184 2018-10-26 23:09:07 With all that said . All the accusations your accusing the President with. How did the President &  Administration  get so much done. Broken countless records Economy 
Jobs, Jobs, &  more  Jobs
Stocks,  401 ks. Regulations 
Regulations ETC. The most achieved by far in long time
3185 2018-10-26 23:08:26 Index has not gone under 10k so there is lot more pain .. many great stocks have not corrected much
3186 2018-10-26 23:08:17 Which again brings up the question as to how an average person will receive rebates well in excess of what they will be paying? The ROI on paying for pollution is better than most stocks.
3187 2018-10-26 23:06:55 He probably is drinking anti freeze cuz he can’t see that his stocks suck
3188 2018-10-26 23:06:23 Tostitos stocks jumped 5 points!
3189 2018-10-26 23:05:00 Read ur article. Retirees need money now but also need stocks in their portfolio for their future. In these times retirees should lower their spending rather take ur advice of not being in stocks because they “need money now”.
3190 2018-10-26 23:04:29 Attribution studies are improving so we should see more of that (though usually after some delay). Re weather and climate, there's no doubt great interest in the former (much more, I'd argue, than daily market readings re stocks, etc). that interest is an opportunity to inform...
3191 2018-10-26 23:03:24 Again another knee-jerk reaction from the market to some stocks with great fundamentals... $AMZN $AMD $TXN. $JNJ is looking good since June!
3192 2018-10-26 23:03:13 Potential exists for a serious downturn now.  Tech stocks took a dive today.  Nasdaq down 115 points.  Time to test your ability to go long or short out now.
3193 2018-10-26 23:00:53 Yep. I am happy with my investment. 200% return and a working product with more down the pipeline is all I need to be happy. Again, I would suggest you should invest into stocks and bonds so there is less manipulation. It will make you less angry at the world. LOL
3194 2018-10-26 22:59:44 nobody cares about homemade pics.... stocks are up  unemployment is at all time low, were not at war .... #4moreYears
3195 2018-10-26 22:59:38 Wtf? Explains why the stocks are all red....
3196 2018-10-26 22:58:29 The flow of fish: crypto top, pot stocks top, and the top in equities. nice.
3197 2018-10-26 22:55:05 Late cycle is when the biggest selloffs happen, plus we have I think some problems under the surface that haven't come to light yet. Maybe $DB, Italy, China, other EMs. Rates are going up and stocks will need to adjust, plus deficit spending. It's a perfect storm.
3198 2018-10-26 22:53:47 Are folks dumping their stocks in those Silicon Valley companies with leftwing zealots at their helm? Are people dumping Netflix because they are tired of watching movies full of actors who bash all conservatives? Could be... People stopped watching the NFL. #MAGA #VoteRed
3199 2018-10-26 22:52:42 From WSJ: Howard Marks of Oaktree is looking at Chinese distressed debt opportunities, and they are "actively looking" at Chinese stocks following their dive this year.
3200 2018-10-26 22:52:19 Before you buy a home, better make sure you understand the ramifications of owning property in a country without the will or means to maintain the sanctity of its borders. This explains the weakness in the banking stocks. They are in the business of loaning money to home buyers!
3201 2018-10-26 22:50:37 Yep. How is that different from a stock broker? Doing nothing? Most people work paycheck to paycheck to earn the money that is invested in ETN. Also, I would suggest not investing in the crypto market. Maybe stocks and bonds would be a good investment for you. More regulated.
3202 2018-10-26 22:47:56 Oyster Mushrooms for sale...
We have available stocks...
3203 2018-10-26 22:47:52 I’ve seen beats + reduced guidance given uncertainty. Either way, earnings up big vs year end (tax cuts + strong top line growth) and stocks are down YTD. Technicals are gross, but not seeing it in fundamentals yet. Could happen due to many causes, but not seeing it.
3204 2018-10-26 22:46:36 I think you might wanna check your facts before shooting from the hip at a dude and company that are changing the world. It isn’t a Tesla. I’m surprised you’re in crypto - shouldn’t you be shilling petro-trump-old world bullshit stocks instead?
3205 2018-10-26 22:45:38 Be careful what you post, your gonna F up my stocks! The Tesla stock closed down 6% the day you smoked that blunt on the @joerogan podcast
3206 2018-10-26 22:45:24 Up to a few months ago my avg was -$1k per day and blowing up numerous accounts...took a step back, reviewed my losses and noticed constant errors, got my mind and attitude right...today I’m avg +$2k per day.  #NeverGiveUp #stocks #trading #DayTrading
3207 2018-10-26 22:44:28 Recessions start with a prior good economy. Stocks have been up for 9+ years. Long time but eight of those the economy was stagnant. Might throw the timing differently than you think.
3208 2018-10-26 22:44:04 HIGHBEAM UNITY stocks rallying
3209 2018-10-26 22:42:18 My stocks all crashed 
3210 2018-10-26 22:42:03 Positioning big part of the story: systematic strategies, HFs etc all long - now flat. Notable that EM & EAFE stocks & most US sectors peaked in Q1. Recent equity-centric spasm energised by capitulation in remaining bull themes: US discretionary (ETF AUM +50% in 3mths) and tech.
3211 2018-10-26 22:41:40 I have been cashing my GICs and bonds to buy those high yielding stocks. So many to choose from !
3212 2018-10-26 22:41:23 Misleading investors with false economic indicators, rallying terrorists into a frenzy to the point that they act on terrorism, failing economy, falling stocks, failing exports, job markets unhealthy, our country is divided by propaganda provided by Trump. Hate crimes up.
3213 2018-10-26 22:40:45 Does anyone know when #CampingWorld, $CWH, first made it known it would go public?

3215 2018-10-26 22:39:12 Blaze smirks
"Are you the one in the stocks, 'your magisty'~?'
Blaze giggles, making a small joke at your expense
"It would be fun to use a slut like that, though~"
3216 2018-10-26 22:38:46 Remember it has a lot to do with unemployment and the entire Stock market dear. Stocks are all connected and please stop copying and pasting from google that so obvious. i don't want to argue with your fake knowledge of economics. Stop replying disconnect!
3217 2018-10-26 22:38:11 STOCKS;  The stock market (Dow) declined 1,800 points (7%) during October.   It is very oversold and due for a bounce.  Wall Street (republicans) are going to also be pushing hard to get investors to buy before the elections.  Longer term, many analysts warn of further declines.
3218 2018-10-26 22:37:34 What is the catalyst? I can't find any news to push these stocks higher
3219 2018-10-26 22:37:17 It's too sad to see. I will have to leave social media for a long time. Trump is turned to the dark side. I have to say goodbye to him. I can't support him anymore. Please save yourself, sell stocks, keep distance from Trump, don't go anywhere near his rallies.
3220 2018-10-26 22:37:06 Limited stocks only
Reserve your now
3221 2018-10-26 22:35:55 The fiat/stocks clown train is basically a million morons who think they’re the only one who figured out fiat/stocks are Ponzi, therefore, they’ll get out before everyone else because they’re so smart.
So far, every one of them got financially assraped but they keep on trying.
3222 2018-10-26 22:35:44 Well, each to their own, it will either go up, down or sideways :). There is just a massive amount of selling pressure. I dont hold losing stocks but then again I trade, I don't invest (other than property).
3223 2018-10-26 22:35:37 Pre order
Limited stocks only
Reserve yours now 
3224 2018-10-26 22:33:34 @tonyposnanski this is REALLY bad, but we need to pay attention to the voters in Texas who say the voting machines are changing their votes, right in front of them.  That, and the crashing of the tech stocks.....
3225 2018-10-26 22:33:32 bro im proud of my group~ they hold the most daesangs in kpop history and are smart enough to sit the corruption out. i stan a group who the industry tries to dethrone~ and in general, of course their stocks dropped wtf bts is insanely powerful ?? im not here +
3226 2018-10-26 22:33:23 Le téléphone a quand même 1 an. Du mal à épuiser les stocks ?
3227 2018-10-26 22:32:05 Tops was a nice surprise at close
3228 2018-10-26 22:31:44 The economy is not doing well. The stock market is doing well. The vast majority of people do not own stocks. The unemployment rate is down because people have been unemployed so long they have been timed out of benefits or have stopped looking for work. But yeah, dude sux 2.
3229 2018-10-26 22:31:43 whenever the market is down my bf is like "BABE, QUICK! Stocks are on sale!!" and tbh it's incredibly attractive
3230 2018-10-26 22:31:25 Intuitively, it makes sense. It is like trading discipline. At the time of rebalance, you book profit on stocks that did well and bought more of stocks that didn't do that well. That way it is a good anti-momentum strategy with a size bias as well.
3231 2018-10-26 22:31:08 No trades for me today. Came to the market early, appeared that nothing was going on. Thought it was gonna be like yesterday (considered $RRTS and decided to avoid - tend to lose on sub $2.00 stocks because I want bigger size). Took a nap, and woke up 3:30EST to find $YECO... 1/2
3232 2018-10-26 22:30:28 2 technology stocks jumped strong on Friday:
$NATI 16.8%, $LOGM 10.9%
3233 2018-10-26 22:30:01 The stocks are down again lmao. Ay dios mio
3234 2018-10-26 22:28:47 Correct .. BTC is in no way a safe haven yet .. it may be one day but it is not yet .. too volatile .. safe havens dont pump 20% in a day. People go to safe havens in times of fear and uncertainty to escape the volatility. When stocks bottom thats when BTC will be good to buy.
3235 2018-10-26 22:27:45 (To the tune of all the small things)

All the
Small gains
That my
Stocks made
Wiped out
This month
Always,
I know
Too high P/E ratio...
Say it ain't so
Markets are low
Massive sell-off
The TSX blows
3236 2018-10-26 22:27:41 Pot stocks did okay today considering everything; was expecting a lot worse!
3237 2018-10-26 22:25:30 2 technology stocks plummeted  on Friday:

3238 2018-10-26 22:24:06 It would be very very sad if these major tech companies were cooperating with each other to bring the stocks down...wonder if they would be willing to loss their money for the leftist alliance
3239 2018-10-26 22:23:43 (Long post inc.) Imo not overlooked at all. This is the hope that most retail investors have from what I’m seeing and many are hoping for this to be the cash. People rushing to crypto as shelter from stocks. But crypto is hella risky, in a GLOBAL recession gold and cash are king
3240 2018-10-26 22:23:37 Those who heeded my advice are making big profits Shorting the stock indexes. lower buy-back stops on the Dow to 24,950 & S&P to 2702 as they are very oversold. Never get in the way of a falling knife. Stay long SPXS. Stay short the Nikkei #Indexes #Commodities #Stocks #Dow
3241 2018-10-26 22:21:43 Stocks go up, and down. Typically down during elections, it's normal.
3242 2018-10-26 22:21:12 They are defence stocks so I’m not worrying too much
Budget should see more money available for defence 
They will rebound, I’ll hold on, it’s pocket money and the dividends pays for a few good nights out a few times a year

3245 2018-10-26 22:20:06 The best estimates are $4B annually in donations. We know with some level of certainty that the church has $32B in stocks alone. It would be nice if the church were transparent with its finances though.
3246 2018-10-26 22:19:49 Be wary of market cycles. We are noticeably late-cycle in traditional equities. Remain relatively cash-and-bond heavy, and be ready to pour investments into real estate and high-beta stocks when the bottom drops. Don't worry about catching bottom, you will have saved $ no matter.
3247 2018-10-26 22:19:20 @Jack and co. doing damage control, and they wonder why their stocks are in the tank
3248 2018-10-26 22:18:57 But these days they own pharmacuielic stocks, & other items in their portfolios which is why so many are worth millions after serving.

3257 2018-10-26 22:11:11 Still have to define “income”. Stocks, artworks, foreign investments, real estate.
No deduction for charity? Charities go broke. 
No deduction for home ownership? Housing suffers.
No deduction for catastrophic situations?
Privately owned business - what do they get to deduct?
3258 2018-10-26 22:10:34 And I always look for the dip after a pp from a good company is announced. Good time to buy and then sell them after the pp is closed.

3262 2018-10-26 22:04:28 I'm sorry but I don't like to recommend stocks. My only interest is that people get the best information we can provide and let people decide themselves. There are just too many issues and it's much more than the resource. For example, management is as crucial as any resource.
3263 2018-10-26 22:02:50 Perspective conversation about the stock...

It appears EVERYTHING was down today

Amazon was down 7.8%
Netflix was down 4.1%
 
Apparently this was a BAD WEEK for stocks as a whole. Nasdaq was down 2% and the DOW was down as well. SNAP dropped 10%, GOOGL down 2%.

Bigger picture.
3264 2018-10-26 22:02:43 STOCKS;  The stock market (Dow) declined 1,800 points (7%) during October.   It is very oversold and due for a bounce.  Wall Street (republicans) are going to also be pushing hard to get investors to buy before the elections.  Longer term, many analysts warn of further declines.
3265 2018-10-26 22:02:20 I'm over here still living paycheck to paycheck, trying to save as much as possible and you are over here trying to get me to send you $150 with no guarantee of any return. I can use that money towards food or save it or put it in stocks if it's extra and be better off

3274 2018-10-26 21:53:45 1) A scenario that no one is thinking about (they do, but not with the reasoning I apply to it)
Stock Bullrun is over
People are greedy, remember that. People who had the taste of gains will look for this feeling, no matter where they can invest in.
Stocks remain bearish
3275 2018-10-26 21:53:41 You think I need to play you right now lmao who the fuck are you I’m out having a good time , it’s Friday night you play this game everyday lmaoo . I sell Diamonds and trade stocks for a living , who are you to me lmaoooo a peasant !

3277 2018-10-26 21:52:24 Tip - Trading to some feels like an adrenaline rush, but climbing a cliff for an hour also gives an adrenaline rush, a clear head, builds muscle, and challenges you to think it through to the top. Your stocks must also be thought through, with preparation to finish at the top.
3278 2018-10-26 21:51:37 Look at housing and building materials stocks.
3279 2018-10-26 21:50:28 I disagree. We have so lost the ball on civility that the time for calling out behavior without calling names is right now. As I said the other day: stocks and stones may break your bones but words will incite people to bomb you.
3280 2018-10-26 21:50:12 $amlh it's confirmed, Bishop is no longer the CEO of GGMN. @young_pfy5811  They are not in business anymore about to shut their doors. It's over for AMLH. It's going to no bid!! Sell what you can. I did. Damn him. F Bishop. Stupid man!! I'm moving to POT stocks and will make $$$

3282 2018-10-26 21:49:41 Smh. You are really a block head. The link does not refer to company income tax. It refers to personal income tax. $100k is salary from Berkshire. He has dividends from stocks he owns. He has rental income. All these make up his earnings which he paid a tax of $1.8m
3283 2018-10-26 21:49:35 Vitually all insulin comes from outside the U.K. 
The govt are only stockpiling for 6 weeks - what happens after that? Brexit doesn’t just go away.  Holland (I think) said they would build up stocks+ for us they were so worried re just 6wks.

3285 2018-10-26 21:48:04 Vote Democrat, Trump and GOP are tearing up this country.  Stocks are in holding mode, people using pipe bombs against Democrats,  Trump trying to cut Seniors benefits, Trump losing his temper more and more, list keeps growing. VOTE DEMOCRATS!
3286 2018-10-26 21:46:24 @OptionsAction Hi, what other tech stocks besides #FB does Carter Worth think will not make another “forever high” or “1-3”years...#GOOGL #NFLX? Any others?
3287 2018-10-26 21:46:16 Stocks are falling because of lack of stability in this country from the top
3288 2018-10-26 21:44:12 AT&T (T) expanded business model & insiders have been buying. At $29.09 with an annual dividend of 6.67% a P/E around 5.6 makes T worth looking into. Earnings rose past analysts expectations of $45.63 mil and revenues of $39.7 billion in 3rd qtr 2017.

3290 2018-10-26 21:43:21 Rob. Like your work. However, am i supposed to understand we can invest in stocks, regardless of strategy and never have a rough month?
3291 2018-10-26 21:43:10 Business booming, especially international. Builder stocks driving a construction boom.
Conservative judges in place 
These are my main ones
3292 2018-10-26 21:42:34 I'm going to take the middle ground here. 

Stocks are in limited supply, but yes they're being compared to something that has inflation and likely hidden inflation as well.

I do think it can still be roughly used to compare some things.

Also chairs aren't limited in supply.
3293 2018-10-26 21:40:24 Yep,  you’re absolutely right imo.  
My stocks look really bad.  Orders set for 2009 lows.  But. Get to buyin’ crypto fam!  ASAP.  Bitcoin is risk aversion
3294 2018-10-26 21:40:19 Is the market burning off excesses in valuation, yes. Will that burning off erase the repatriation of $4 trillion, will it erase benefits of corporate tax cuts, will it erase the impact of ending thousands of costly regulations... Doubtful...

3312 2018-10-26 21:27:15 LOL. That's just news people scrambling to explain some reason for price movement. Once you see stocks go up on good AND bad news or vice versa, you learn that most news is complete garbage and has nothing to do with price movement.
3313 2018-10-26 21:27:13 So for those with asthma , go get a checkup pls . Double check your action plan and stocks of medicine.
3314 2018-10-26 21:27:07 Considering Trump opened all thr coast around the USA for oil rigging. Which was never done before thr employment rates, economy potentially and less reliance on middle east could prelong a stock market crash
 Elite will crash it when they are ready #NASDAQ #stocks #crypto
3315 2018-10-26 21:27:06 I don’t care how much my stocks go up. Nothing is worth funding the wall, cutting health care for seniors, tearing our country apart, and putting kids in cages then destroying their family records.
3316 2018-10-26 21:25:18 Stocks & stakes = bread & butter
3317 2018-10-26 21:24:26 You're spot on George. If C&R is done properly it can be an important factor in protecting existing stocks. Data supports it, anglers support it, angling organisations support it.
3318 2018-10-26 21:23:17 Except most people bought it when it was 10k+ and not it’s nearly half that. Crypto currency is for gullible chumps. It’s basically the 2018 version of penny stocks. Every legitimate investor knows this. It’s way too volatile and that’s been proven with how far it’s dropped.
3319 2018-10-26 21:23:13 Much too scary looking even without the magazine! Adjustable stocks, heat shields, and funny looking grips are what “ASSUALT” rifles are made of. 
3320 2018-10-26 21:22:39 Here are this week’s worst stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq
3321 2018-10-26 21:21:04 After the compressed expiry, the expectation was some uncoiling as we saw with TAMO, but we saw a further fall. This is not that time yet, no matter how valued individual stocks become. It’s boring to wait, esp. when you have cash, don’t forget what you have is the real King
3322 2018-10-26 21:20:43 What an utter waste of space and air ... like the rest of the old brexwits who have ZERO clue about trade and economics, ONLY caring about making money from inevitable CRASH (-> ££ made shorting £ & UK stocks, like Odey/chaos capitalists) gets invested in CHEAP FIRE SALE ASSETS)
3323 2018-10-26 21:18:15 Heavy selling marks end to wild week for stocks (CNN Money)
3324 2018-10-26 21:18:10 Amen. Should be required on-air disclosure like analysts who own stocks.
3325 2018-10-26 21:18:09 The stocks that are valued based on a boundless future have taken a much worse beating than average the past couple of weeks.
3326 2018-10-26 21:18:08 Bad days? You bet, cash out? Absolutely not! I held stocks through Bull/Bear cycles making 400%+ profit. It’s called research backed by earnings. You control the outcome of your investing. Set criteria, find a stock that meets it & for fun, pretend  you bought 1000 sh. For 6 mos.
3327 2018-10-26 21:17:41 TN limited on trading certain stocks. But those were available to trade on TN luckily.
3328 2018-10-26 21:17:27 If you think about it Rick, this was part of the tax scam plans.  Give the super rich a tax cut, which would cause the market to drop.  Then they could buy back their stocks being sold off and own more of the profit.  Makes sense.
3329 2018-10-26 21:17:24 No problem. I refresh my spreadsheet now and then and remove heavy shorted stocks from the screening. Not worth a bum fight with heavy conviction trades on the opposite side of the book
3330 2018-10-26 21:16:49 Market Close: MBS +19bps; DOW -296.24; NASDAQ -151.12; S&P 500 -46.88; 10yr Treasury 3.08%; Stocks & Yields close near today's Lows heading into the weekend, as it did globally.
3331 2018-10-26 21:16:37 So someone explain economics to me: WWE lost billions of dollars of their market cap but didn't want to cancel Crown Jewel because of maybe 20 million dollars as part of their 4th quarter earnings? Stocks fluctuate with public opinion. WWE chose poorly.
3332 2018-10-26 21:15:13 I’m a swing trader so now you know my time frame. I buy high flying stocks that make money and short high flying stocks that lose money.
3333 2018-10-26 21:15:08 Nah I use cmeg. They let u trade those stocks?
3334 2018-10-26 21:15:06 S&P500 dips down to 2532 & we bounce.. start to buy the market again

S&P500 dips down to 2532 & we don’t finish the day above that level.. head for the hills bc it’s going down much more

Until we get to those levels, play it safe w/ investments & stay away from high P/E stocks
3335 2018-10-26 21:15:03 Up from what time period.  US Stocks have been increasing for 8 years.   But when I look at mine today the past 12 months of gains have been wiped out.   I am not lying.  It is easily true that we have different investments w/n our portfolio.   Notice I’m not accusing u of lying.
3336 2018-10-26 21:14:56 At 3am tomorrow we will learn by tweet how dems and George Soros are tanking stocks to make #Spanky look bad.
3337 2018-10-26 21:14:40 Suggestion:  If you have a 401K that has BONDS. Change it IMMEDIATELY to strictly Private Money (Stocks).
3338 2018-10-26 21:14:31 Haven't traded stocks for a whole. Definitely considering shorting the market rn.
3339 2018-10-26 21:14:02 I would like to start a community that is pro crypto but also works together with assets outside of crypto.  While my favorite asset is crypto, I also like stocks, REI, and many other assets. The more you learn the more you earn.  $Trx $Btc $Xlm $Ada #Xrp

* Of those companies, 237, or 47%, are down more than 20% from their 52-week high.

3353 2018-10-26 21:05:10 Easy for me to buy the argument that alot of the PE multiple rerating in popular stocks has to do with growth in indexing, passive structures. Some of these companies have seen incredible PE expansion that doesnt seem deserved.
3354 2018-10-26 21:03:23 I hope not! Stocks are dwindling and won’t be replaced.

3358 2018-10-26 21:01:31 Brand new stocks and posters on that van. As if they were just put on yesterday. .   Hmmmmm
3359 2018-10-26 21:01:15 The skin of the bubble is over stretched, US stocks are way over valued still and we will see a 50% correction over the next 14 months, especially with the FED monetary policy QT and no more artificial money to buy bonds which in turn prop up the hopium bubble of the US a markets

3367 2018-10-26 21:00:10 Admit it Media... we all know the STOCKS are down prior to the elections... a lot at risk... If Republicans maintain control, you can bet Stocks will skyrocket!!!  #MAGA

3368 2018-10-26 21:00:04 Stocks could rally 20% after this bruising rout, says Guggenheim’s Minerd — after that, watch out
3369 2018-10-26 20:59:51 Si j’étais vous je commencerais à faire des stocks et je commencerais à m’inquiéter pour mes économies. #ChaosAVenir
3370 2018-10-26 20:59:45 And which of my stocks did you just destroy? 
3371 2018-10-26 20:59:38 The SNP do not give a toss about fishing, they have actively supported the synthetic salmon industry whilst they have destroyed the wild native salmon and sea trout stocks and with it the recreational angling revenue stream
3372 2018-10-26 20:59:19 I personally like 2-5% sales or more before I buy.  Sell offs are opportunities for solid stocks and those that produce dividends.
3373 2018-10-26 20:59:06 Thanks for breaking down stocks. Good show all day. I did my Xmas shopping done for the rest of my life. Wait until everyone does late Xmas shopping, Im guilty of it. Got to run to the stores I bought. lol. Have a great weekend. Thanks for the reporting. Cheers. See ya in 10 days
3374 2018-10-26 20:58:53 would be nice to get this chopped up into a summary video, was quite pthe discussion .... way more insight to be gained from this than the usual touting stocks or "unusual options activity"
3375 2018-10-26 20:57:46 Honestly, I wanted in on the equities world & wouldn't take no for an answer. Banged on a MILLION doors for literally months - managed to get a personal letter to him, showed him progress on the CFA curriculum, was told to pitch him 5 stocks, led to an interview & he gave me shot
3376 2018-10-26 20:57:05 So the economy grew 3.5% in 3Q and Trump is his usual reserved self about it. If this news was so great, why did stocks drop?
3377 2018-10-26 20:56:59 That’s not how stocks work.
3378 2018-10-26 20:56:10 well that's why we are the residual supplier to the world, things may get interesting in the spring, this is not 2007 but world stocks are tight, one good growing season takes care of it but we don't trade what we know, we trade what we don't
3379 2018-10-26 20:55:48 Didn’t this dumbfuck just say stocks were going down 40%?
3380 2018-10-26 20:54:00 If stocks crash, people go to cash, not volatile unregulated emerging markets 
3381 2018-10-26 20:53:56 On stocks they are all horrid.  All talking buy the dip on FANG (of course no money to buy dips when one is all invested already -- LOL) --  instead of picking up value names that are bottoming
3382 2018-10-26 20:51:19 "Guess his stocks crashed in the marketplace of ideas  " I tweet. BoNgWaTer69 hasn't responded in two hours. I have won the e-debate, they think.

They don't know that the Slavic assassin that I paid two Bitcoin to garrotte him at his desk has just sent me visual confirmation.
3383 2018-10-26 20:50:43 My stocks lost me 400$  this week 
3384 2018-10-26 20:50:26 The Old Stocks Inn.... superb!
3385 2018-10-26 20:50:00 Hmmmm, my stocks have taken a nose dive .... so much for all this ‘winning’ 
3386 2018-10-26 20:49:41 While stocks last?.. Based on recent events I wonder if  @Lidl will be placing these mouldy treats back on the shelf next year?
3387 2018-10-26 20:49:36 Yup. Happens every single time the republicans take office. They must have a buttload of military stocks in their portfolios. Think Chaney and the money he made off wars and destruction.
3388 2018-10-26 20:49:16 Some great trading by @CarolNe42049678 @dsilverio70 @JoedaddyBLS @AlanWeedspan @ContractTraderT @Follow2TheMoney and the entire @TrueTradingGrp team today! Whole team was earning and learning! Awesome way to end the week #Stocks #FridayFeeling #FollowFriday
3389 2018-10-26 20:48:57 Don't knock the one stop....great staff AND it stocks The Guardian...
3390 2018-10-26 20:48:09 Over the last decade flows have moved from active (high TE) to passive (low TE), which coincided with much higher returns over the latest period for stocks (thus better for passive). Again... don’t know their methodology, but an example of how it could work.
3391 2018-10-26 20:47:33 When your niche stocks are not there to trade.  Take a break and wait for your setups.   The easiest way to give back gains is trying to trade something you are not familiar with.  It happened to me this week.
3392 2018-10-26 20:47:17 The companies have all been owned by the central banking system that owns the stocks that manipulate everything you're going to have to look way deeper than what meets the eye.
3393 2018-10-26 20:46:57 Of course #stocks were a bubble.
Stocks can't sustainably keep soaring - while incomes near-flat and a high percentage of incomes of current working aged nil.
Exact repeat of housing bubble pattern.
3394 2018-10-26 20:46:04 Ross has tons of oil stocks in his portfolio
3395 2018-10-26 20:45:56 As world endings stocks fall prices are sure to find support, but the trip to the low 80’s will be slow and deliberate. The market needs fresh mill demand which has been slow to materialize. Mills continue to take up cotton on a hand to mouth basis as the U.S. crop falls.
3396 2018-10-26 20:45:50 Stocks headed into bear territory. Next week is that special week - the end of October. Techs slaughtered today, S&P down 46 - that is rough. Will the February lows hold next week? 70% of stocks down 10%. Stocks on pace for the worst OCTOBER since 2008  Ron DeSantis? Winning?
3397 2018-10-26 20:45:14 Every year it flares up. The wife catches me duck walking and stocks  up on icy hot patches and excedren extra strength.
3398 2018-10-26 20:45:11 CNBC, stocks on pace to be worst October since 2008. Thanks to tarriff trader Trump. I ask again, who would hire a real estate developer that's blew hundreds of millions of Daddy's money and gone bankrupt 6 times to run the largest economy in the world? MAGGITS.
3399 2018-10-26 20:44:53 Stocks headed into bear territory. Next week is that special week - the end of October. Techs slaughtered today, S&P down 46 - that is rough. Will the February lows hold next week? 70% of stocks down 10%. Stocks on pace for the worst OCTOBER since 2008  Ron DeSantis? Winning?
3400 2018-10-26 20:44:34 Awesome review David. I was looking forward to news and stocks app on Mac and time-laps wallpaper looks awesome. Will upadte my macbook pro tonight.
3401 2018-10-26 20:44:17 #Tslaq shorts desperately trying to turn Tesla stocks around. Fail. Still up $16 a share. Another half billion further in the hole they go.
3402 2018-10-26 20:44:07 #WR: Sensitivity of Wall Street investors. Part IV. Today, after the Wall St. closure @Reuters wrote “U.S. stocks were lower on Friday afternoon following a slew of high-profile earnings disappointments...” Technology continues as very sensitive issue of our economy. #tech_stock
3403 2018-10-26 20:43:21 Those companies have US charters, their stocks are publicly traded on US exchanges and enforced in US courts. Is there any doubt that the US could seize ownership of any US company? It has happened many times in the past, so IDK what you mean here.
3404 2018-10-26 20:42:44 Just going to wait until stocks are “fair valued”. Hopefully I’ll make my first investment before I retire...
3405 2018-10-26 20:42:43 $GRUB is one of the more exciting longs here w/ today's close. Report was actually full of positives & they are pressing pedal for growth (what you want to hear for these kinds of stocks)

GS added to conviction Buy list but gap dn + early selloff broke tape ( al $PTI $5.20~)
3406 2018-10-26 20:42:40 That’s good. Me too. Held $amzn and $goog. They are kind of core holdings, though @Sarge986 can do without $goog. I see his point of view. I think we can do without many stocks at this point! Haha
3407 2018-10-26 20:42:34 life long auto tech llc. This article just registered, if memory serves, u talked about this few years back, I'm trading learning, you got me both autorepair & trading are linked: U did I see. 'stocks to trade' last man standing. Man u just woke me up! frontal lobe'.. lol
3408 2018-10-26 20:42:08 I would rebuy positions in large cap stocks such as $AMZN, $AAPL, $BA, $NFLX, $MSFT, $RTN, $GOOGL & $V once the timing is right (just to name a few). I think that’s a good starting point.
3409 2018-10-26 20:41:45 $MHK, $WDC, $SIVB, $FBHS, and $CERN are the top five stocks that closed lower today.
3410 2018-10-26 20:41:26 I bought one of my boyfriend's dogs a business suit Halloween costume and it's pretty much the best. Would absolutely let him pick my stocks.
3411 2018-10-26 20:41:19 Crazy week in the stock market. I was lagging overall there for awhile because I have about half of my portfolio in cash. Now beating the market by a nice margin with the recent declines. Looking to put some more $ to work soon. I could use more AT&T $T . #Stocks #Investing
3412 2018-10-26 20:41:09 He's probably talking about play trading on the net or stocks of corn. Smart investors aren't buying US stocks, they're buying shares. I'd rather have a claim on the company assets and future earnings than stocks that might bottom out tomorrow.
3413 2018-10-26 20:40:17 yeah throw em in the stocks for sure
3414 2018-10-26 20:39:48 CNN and professionalism, now that's hysterical!  They are laughing stocks, all of them.

3416 2018-10-26 20:39:08 Stocks going up today 
3417 2018-10-26 20:38:50 #Stocks fell sharply on Friday as investors slogged through another volatile session on Wall St. #Dow slid 296.24 to 24,688.31. #Nasdaq dropped 2.1% to 7,167.21. #SP500 fell 1.7% and briefly entered into correction territory, trading over 10% below its record high reached in Sep.
3418 2018-10-26 20:37:51 Unpopular opinion: #Bitcoin will outperform stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets.
3419 2018-10-26 20:36:28 Any of my friends who trade stocks or forex familiar with the social trading platform Zulutrade?
3420 2018-10-26 20:36:26 $AMRN  Nice price action today considering overall market conditions.  Disappointing the stock could not hold and close above $22 mark for a 4th straight day.  Can't complain too much, $AMRN is one of the best performing stocks across all major indexes.
3421 2018-10-26 20:34:52 Stocks - Dow Falls Nearly 300 Points as Red October Continues
3422 2018-10-26 20:34:47 to draw a line chart of stocks, I choose Sony and other three tech stocks
Then I need to transform the data so each stock begins at 100...
What? The price of Sony's stock has never reached 100???
Do not go bankrupt, Sony!!! (I love this company)
3423 2018-10-26 20:34:39 Exactly the same here. I got out with some pretty good gains. I went into real estate funds which have done surprisingly well. They usually correspond to the stock market but I'm thinking that's a place some people will go when they get out of stocks.
3424 2018-10-26 20:34:24 $ROP, $COG, $CINF, $RMD, and $LEN were the top five stocks that closed higher today.
3425 2018-10-26 20:34:08 #NOSB Liquid fish products:

Bradman (NOSB, environmentalists/resource conservationists member) cites vast support in comments for relisting, but also concern regarding use of wild fish stocks as source materials. She would like a work agenda item to look at this issue. 1/3
3426 2018-10-26 20:33:33 A great one again. Very entertaining. I used to only like the ones you talk about stocks picks. Now I think I like the Great Quotes now. I have seen “Winter Dreams” and only remembered the tragedy the first half and comedy the second. Will watch “As you like it” soon.
3427 2018-10-26 20:33:27 Non sur bts mania mais les stocks partent très vite j’ai encore d’autres merch à trouver mais c’est chaud
3428 2018-10-26 20:33:19 You were correct maybe buy stocks
3429 2018-10-26 20:33:15 $AMD, $GE, $F, $BAC, and $T were the top five most active stocks today.
3430 2018-10-26 20:32:38 This is NOT tariff results.. nice try though.. This is an instability in Tech Stocks and also the adjustments to interest rates by the Obama Fed Reserve people. What you are seeing is a natural adjustment, and will continue to excel in November! Jobs are NOT leaving, but coming!
3431 2018-10-26 20:31:22 Once again, this insight precisely supports my point about currencies: Currencies depend on laws to function, not the other way around. US stock issuers make no laws, and are dependent on US laws to even issue their stocks in the first place.
3432 2018-10-26 20:31:07 There are no coincidences when manipulating the market. Kudlow and his buddies even know, a few words here and there, mention a few companies and their stocks rocket or crash. Now they’re manipulating the whole market, criminal.
3433 2018-10-26 20:30:11 To be honest when pmln achieved 53k in stocks. Dollar was 103 rs. Therefore if pti wants to beat pmln record they have to do close to 65k. This is as per market capitalisation.

3435 2018-10-26 20:30:01 Second day of growth in Tesla stocks 
3436 2018-10-26 20:29:23 How do you all feel about polls?  I'm trying to put money/ time behind candidates with a shot. All signs point towards a Foxx victory in #NC05 so should I cut my losses and move support from my 'adopted' candidate DDAdams? This is like chasing stocks. Thoughts?
3437 2018-10-26 20:29:21 "Ah Elon-Chan I see Tesla's stocks have been dropping of late, I suppose I'll go back to driving my Pagani Huayra after all."
"*GASP* Zucc-Chan how could you!? I thought you were my friend, but now I'll show you no mercy, I'll show you the true power of Tesla!"

3439 2018-10-26 20:27:48 @ReformedBroker  Who was the guy comparing current tech. stocks to the year 2000? I was listening via the satellite radio.
3440 2018-10-26 20:27:30 Seems I ve made the right choiche to stay outside the market, it was a little test to me,another step to be more professional
At the time I was forced by myself to own always stocks in everysituation, and  of course:blood everywhere! 
Sometimes a victory is to do not partecipate.
3441 2018-10-26 20:27:28 Nobody gets scared when cloths go on sale, they rush to buy them. But when stocks go on sale everybody runs away. Doesn't make sense. Buy the good deals.
3442 2018-10-26 20:27:20 Every one of my stocks is down today except Tesla! What's up with that? And my retirement portfolio is shot to hell.
3443 2018-10-26 20:26:46 Honestly all we need is a November bounce for pot stocks to fly with its other catalysts and if played smart even the ones who held like me will be fine.
3444 2018-10-26 20:26:45 #Stocks,#Indexes Definitely no SPX signal.  NDX top-signaling alone, though not frequent, has happened before.
3445 2018-10-26 20:26:06 I noticed tech stocks taking a pounding.  Any chance a group of friends of Bezos are selling off stocks to mess with the market.

3451 2018-10-26 20:24:14 That is anecdotal evidence suggestive of the fact that the vast majoritu of cash stocks in people's homes was legitimate money for honest reasons based on the truth that India's was a cash economy.
3452 2018-10-26 20:24:03 Wage growth is stagnant, job growth has slowed, stocks are declining, gas prices are rising, inflation is rising, and his new tariff plan hurts all people in the manufacturing industry. 

He’s gutted our healthcare, significantly increased our deficit, and only top 1% benefit.

3455 2018-10-26 20:22:43 Wall Street is full of people who have their ear to the ground. They have cultivated contacts in every area of the economy to make sure they don't miss something. Their pessimism about stocks in the past few weeks convinces me that they are predicting a blue wave.
3456 2018-10-26 20:22:23 Stocks sa Jesa 
3457 2018-10-26 20:22:07 You gotta admit, it takes a special kind of stupid to recklessly deregulate, dump a trillion borrowed dollars into an already-strong economy, and still see stocks lower 10 months out from that massive injection of capital.
3458 2018-10-26 20:21:03 $mosy Short sale rule for Monday applies when the stocks is down more than 10% This is an SEC rule where short sales are only executed on an uptick or when someone pays up to your price where your short order is; you can't hit the bid on a stock with an SSR.
3459 2018-10-26 20:20:39 More volatility in stocks than crypto atm just hoping that btc won’t be 6400 for the next 12 months

Nasdaq down 282 points. 

Buying opportunities abound.

3464 2018-10-26 20:16:06 why trade stocks if you can trade futures ;-)
3465 2018-10-26 20:15:19 That was a fun week in stocks.
3466 2018-10-26 20:15:18 Stocks just got absolutely railed today. Holding  $NEPT $JE $ACB $IIPR $SMG
3467 2018-10-26 20:14:20 Vanguard manages my 401(k).  I have not had the guts to check it since stocks have been falling.  Now that I am retired, I am very concerned my life savings won't be there for me after all those years of saving.  (sigh)
3468 2018-10-26 20:14:10 . I cannot with ‘Faux’ News. Currently on: ‘Stocks continue October sell off’.....Eem.... have they HEARD what’s happening?!
3469 2018-10-26 20:13:53 If I had been long FANG stocks this last year, I’d be using now
3470 2018-10-26 20:13:17 Stocks end with heavy losses but up from day's lows.

Dow -296, -1.2% to 24,688.
Nasdaq -2.1%, S&P -1.7%.

For week, Dow -3.0%, Nasdaq -3.8%, S&P -3.9%

For last 30 days, Dow -6.7%, Nasdaq -10.9%, S&P -8.8%

It's a "Red Wave" alright!
3471 2018-10-26 20:13:13 IF the GDP report was bona fide AND the market actually believed it, why was the Dow down 1.2% today AND the 10yr yield gapped down 6 beeps to 3.07%?  Shouldn't stocks have rallied and yields rose?  #RhetoricalQuestion
3472 2018-10-26 20:12:23 Where do you see the short volume?   I suspect Monday all stocks are going to gap down hard, however recover by mid day, Green into Tuesday.  The calendar for pot stocks has been quite good.    I'm just not clear on why the ACB purchases today rather than Monday? @WolfOfWeedST
3473 2018-10-26 20:11:42 So all my stocks are about where they were at opening bell. Nice flat day keeping the majority of yesterday's gains! I'll take it! 
3474 2018-10-26 20:11:33 New economic numbers show solid growth in the US. but stocks are bouncing again, and there are some warning signs.  Our guest @akaneotani helps make sense of it all, live right now.
3475 2018-10-26 20:11:13 World stocks fall, reversing yesterday's gains: US -1.7%; Europe -.8%. Worries about slowing global growth & investors' realization likely 2019 US eps-growth will be in single-digits weighing on markets. Yesterday's analysis of  yesterday's gains as "dead cat" bounce right-on.
3476 2018-10-26 20:10:46 Stocks headed into bear territory. Next week is that special week - the end of October. Techs slaughtered today, S&P down 46 - that is rough. Will the February lows hold next week? 70% of stocks down 10%. Stocks on pace for the worst OCTOBER since 2008  Ron DeSantis? Winning?
3477 2018-10-26 20:10:03 So thousand point update is coming most likely by the end of next week you can get some really good price action on options right now I would start buying some calls in multiple stocks

3480 2018-10-26 20:09:13 Stocks end sharply lower in another volatile session after earnings disappointment
3481 2018-10-26 20:09:10 I read the other day that if they truly cleaned up Twitter, their stocks would crash and take the company with it.
3482 2018-10-26 20:09:09 @Aurora_MMJ What the#@%_~…§]… is going on with your stocks? I’m losing everything. I thought once you listed on nyse, you would skyrocket! Holy Cow.
3483 2018-10-26 20:08:51 Why do people keep @ me about stocks? Unless someone stole my Twitter identity, I've never commented regarding any stocks, ever.
3484 2018-10-26 20:07:50 Okay but I mean what am I going to do, BUY overvalued stocks when I'm terrified?
3485 2018-10-26 20:07:39 I think the shortside has been overhyped, yes the big boys have unloaded but distributions take time, often new highs are achieved. Most stocks will be $700+ by 2025. QE will get us there.
3486 2018-10-26 20:07:06 "Technical Forecast for Dow, S&P 500, DAX, FTSE 100 and Nikkei"It was another rough week for global equities and stocks haven't yet shaken off the Q4 bearish themes. With a big batch of data on next week's calendar, might we be nearing a change?
3487 2018-10-26 20:06:40 Yes Pierre, but not in the terms that Crypto trading is more porous than #stocks .
3488 2018-10-26 20:06:34 Not only YG...SM and JYP too. JYP lost something around the 20% in stocks

3492 2018-10-26 20:05:10 Stocks down: Dow 24,688.31 -296.24/1.19%; Nasdaq -2.06%; S&P -1.73%. Dow 5day -2.98%, 1mo -6.70%, 3mo -3.01%, YTD -0.14%, 1yr +5.34%.

That’s what I like to hear!
3494 2018-10-26 20:03:48 US stocks saw another spasm of negativity into the close and the trading wk ends with the Dow around 26,684, off 1.2% or about 297 pts. The Nasdaq harder hit, down 2. 1% and the S%P 500 losing 1.7%. @federalreserve @economy @anthonymace10
3495 2018-10-26 20:03:41 Stocks are oversold -  consumer have over bought -  money still over supply -  a recipe I can wait to really try;
3496 2018-10-26 20:03:37 when i started in this business nobody told me stocks also go down
3497 2018-10-26 20:03:35 Over 6% drop from those stories. When Elon tweeted funding secured, stocks flew up but then went down a little bit soon after, he still had to pay a fine. Stock here went down back then back up a little. People need to be help accountable: billionaires, mainstream media, everyone
3498 2018-10-26 20:03:11 I used to get some brazilian bark to soak in linseed for treating stocks back in the 70s, can you remember the name of the stuff ? It was absolutely magic: I made a well used .308 BSA Majestic look better than a Rigby (well - slight exagg).
3499 2018-10-26 20:02:28 Don’t try this race shit, Torres, Morata, Soldado, all white forwards that were made laughing stocks for their awful finishing.
3500 2018-10-26 20:01:47 It's been a rough week to be long #stocks. That said I feel extra bad for people paying to have furus lead them you into chasing stuff like $ESEA $CIFS $MOSY $OHGI $PLAG $NBEV only to lose over 10% in each, even after the member pump.

3504 2018-10-26 20:01:36 Serious question from somebody trying to learn.  GLD attracts big money with its liquidity so is it really representative if big funds are facing redemptions or margin calls?   Maybe the real story on what is happenng with gold is what happens around the edges in  PM stocks?

3531 2018-10-26 19:46:02 The market is in the process of finding a bottom.  Stocks like $BABA, Cdn banks like $TD & $RY are off their lows for the day, & even when the market decides to have a temper tantrum to -400, they don't go back to the low for the day. It's a good sign that they want to go higher

3557 2018-10-26 19:38:16 There are forced rebalancing issues... when stocks outperform (they usually do) you sell stocks to buy bonds. Is that poor behavior if stocks outperform?

There are also trends... high fee active to low fee passive. If stocks underperform after that, is that bad behavior?

3604 2018-10-26 19:21:03 1st of all, the DJI does an amazing job of tracking the market with just 30 stocks and a stupid price weighted average.
2nd of all, go look at the price of IBM when it was kicked off the DJI and the price when it was added back to the DJI. The Dow would be over 100,000.

3606 2018-10-26 19:20:25 Might be worth measuring if this afternoon’s pullback made a 61.8% or 70.7% retrace & nudges back up. Of course risk remains of seeing lower on Monday instead of a follow-on move up. As always, respect your own trading timeframes and styles. $SPX $ES stocks
3607 2018-10-26 19:20:08 Stocks tried to rally back, but it fizzles out. Dow -400 points.

3609 2018-10-26 19:19:21 So are you saying bond yields are going down as stocks are too? Perhaps that supports equities somehow
3610 2018-10-26 19:19:00 How much do distillers pull from the warehouse vs. how much total they have in storage? Nationwide, the figure is about 20%, meaning if no new bourbon was produced, current stocks would last about 5 years w/ no growth.

3612 2018-10-26 19:18:15 Trusting that they know best. Really watching these other beverage stocks catching up and doesn't make sense. Kona has been growing for 2 years and building their base.
3613 2018-10-26 19:17:29 #Stocks struggling to establish a bottom. The positive moves from the likes of $INTC $TSLA and $VRTX are much smaller than the negative moves from companies like $AMZN $WDC and $FB, all in the NASDAQ 100 which is suffering from a serious bout of correction flu.
3614 2018-10-26 19:16:21 Politicians, moguls, price manipulators, exchanges & money minters are propping up the top 10 stocks: the most manipulated/distorted/pumped/scammed/artificially-supported/propped set of asset prices ever. But the scam of finding greater fools & retail suckers is near over.
3615 2018-10-26 19:16:19 At this point if I sell those 2 I lose  $5,500 AMZN & $300 GOOG.  I can deal with GOOG but what to do with AMZN. I worked so hard to get 20 shares of AMZN Because it was supposed to be that big daddy and Wham. Should have just bought more green stocks
3616 2018-10-26 19:16:04 You must use your brain.... research... hundreds of millions can’t be wrong  Feel the peace, stocks, jobs, low regulated, high salaries, medicine for Medicare being slashed, lowest minority unemployment, business openings/ minority’s.. GREAT!

3618 2018-10-26 19:15:17 If it doesn't just take the loss and move on to a stock that does.  There's so many stocks, at least one you will will follow the rules...
3619 2018-10-26 19:15:16 The market has been crashing for the past two weeks. Most top stocks broke 200 dma. 2018 gains lost for most strategies. Lots of other canaries... I bailed where strategic.
3620 2018-10-26 19:14:53 If you're bearish, call Helene's mom and tell her to call Helene to ask what hot stocks she should buy and which retail broker has the lowest margin rates, and maybe even how to mortgage her home to go "all in". And also who to watch on CNBC.

3623 2018-10-26 19:13:38 apple stocks rise by 20%.
3624 2018-10-26 19:13:30 Not that simple! It always goes up or down & very few can manipulate it. Look at the numbers involved too much for anyone no matter how rich to control more than just a few stocks! Programs do more now than anyone but if young get in & leave it in good companies until retirement!
3625 2018-10-26 19:13:22 You probably have a nice bit of profits over the last 20 years! For someone who has only entered the market in mid April, this is tough. Only 17,000 in the market, but no more money to add to down stocks.

3628 2018-10-26 19:12:24 Wondering how to invest in today's #market? Think long term. Thinking long term allows us to purchase #stocks for sale at value prices due to temporary issues. #investment #advice #portfoliomanagement
3629 2018-10-26 19:12:23 So unless you are a pro #hedge fund trader like I was you probably forget the end of the month is here. 3 trading days left.   No gains, no pay on performance.  So do you short more, cover, or gun the longs?  We will see for sure. #stocks. @StockBoardAsset @zerohedge

3631 2018-10-26 19:11:35 If you want to know the truth, follow insitutional volume. Institutions trick retail to keep averaging down or buying dips, when stock moves up they are selling into strength...mutual funds must stay invested so they are rotating into defensive stocks
3632 2018-10-26 19:11:16 Yes, typically pile of shit OTC stocks spiking on no real news are up due to hype and/or manipulation

3635 2018-10-26 19:10:39 Saw better, steadier and more sustainable growth under Obama, but whatever... Hey, anybody checked your stocks lately? Looks like our retirements are now in grave jeopardy thanks to the gop's economic rip-off schemes.

3637 2018-10-26 19:10:03 Why can't you people open short positions (SELL) stocks and gain money.. I wonder why is everyone crying when markets are falling. Seriously!! Very few people are opportunists!! Who agrees??

3641 2018-10-26 19:08:34 Best discussion I've heard on @CNBC in a long time. Smart, wise, civil and educational. $stocks and markets can't be predicted. All we can do is trade them based on "fundamentals" technicals, our personal risk profiles and goals.
3642 2018-10-26 19:08:33 People will keep putting money in any intrument which has price moving upwards, hoping to recover money lost in stocks. So if, just in case if, for some weird reason crypto prices start printing an upwards trajectory...
3643 2018-10-26 19:08:12 Strong trending stocks are good. I looked at metals but they seem to be too unpredictable to make a quick buck on.
3644 2018-10-26 19:07:20 “An irresistible footnote: in 1971, pension fund managers invested a record 122% of net funds available in equities at full prices they couldn’t buy enough of them. In 1974, after the bottom had fallen out, they committed a then record low of 21% to stocks.” - Buffett
3645 2018-10-26 19:07:18 I hear it from several DJT supporters. “I don’t care as long as my stocks are up” well that’s not helping them now so hope they change their tune.
3646 2018-10-26 19:06:58 @POTUS at the very least, needs to audit the Federal Reserve. By raising interest rates they are manipulating the markets to drive stocks down pre mid terms. Anyone confident of a red tsunami might see a buy opportunity during the next 10 days.
3647 2018-10-26 19:06:53 We don’t see eye to eye but I agree there’s no place for ‘bump stocks’ in our society.

But here’s the dilemma, when you give an inch, the Left try’s to take a mile! So in the absence of common sense & trust, we get nowhere.
3648 2018-10-26 19:06:26 If they go at it too hard, they'd own a bunch of worthless stocks. They probably prevented several 5%+ downdays recently.
3649 2018-10-26 19:05:57 Stocks  what like where 10 people own the same shares. Silver first / some gold. Crypto good. Off the exchanges. I’d hold off on real estate at the moment, bubbles bursting.

Not saying this is a top for the markets but certainly looks like $TSLA investors are ignoring one piece of bad news after another. 2019 will end the stock. Too bad my neighbor just bought a 3.

3670 2018-10-26 18:59:18 same here. I just regret not riding these bubble FAANG stocks upwards, but I would have sold too soon anyway had I bought them. The only sector worth buying from a valuation basis are gold miners (queue Paul having an aneurism).

3672 2018-10-26 18:58:19 The next bear market rally in stocks will probably bring this back above its previous high. Rates are going to rise long term and everyone on Wall Street doesn't believe it yet. Will reach 6%
3673 2018-10-26 18:58:15 I think I should stick to my lane when it comes to stocks. I haven't made one successful pick yet. At least I have stocks for when they do rise and I didn't put money in that would impact my lifestyle #LongHold
3674 2018-10-26 18:58:12 traders need to trade both sides but especially short side which many are not adept. random erratic moves and the sad part is still MASSIVELY overbot. we can do 220 to 180 in $SPY and still be in overbot area on many stocks.
3675 2018-10-26 18:58:07 DeMark probability is 56%. The best book recommended for traders by Paul Tudor Jones was written in 1948 by Robert Edwards & John Magee - Technical Analysis of Stocks Trends. Nothing changed since that time. Robots trade the same way nowadays but on lower quicker timeframes.

3715 2018-10-26 18:38:14 Taken together, these two points alone account for a massive edge in the stability of currency over stocks. But one might quibble that it does not wholly dispense with the notion that "dilution" via money issue might somehow spark inflation in currency markets.

3727 2018-10-26 18:32:14 ButTrump's way is the wrong way.Stocks are up-but wages are stagnant.His tariffs have cause large companies to close in some areas. His products aren't made in America-why do you believe him when he spews this crap?He pays lip service to get your support;looks like it's working.
3728 2018-10-26 18:32:06 Stocks are up & down, what does that mean to the Trump administration?
Proof that all is not as rosey as they would have us believe & that many of us are going to get hit at tax time!

3733 2018-10-26 18:31:24 good job Rafael!
3734 2018-10-26 18:30:42 The answer is simple, Saudi
money, money,money in the pockets of trump and legislators.Not to mention those who own stocks in companies making arms.
3735 2018-10-26 18:30:35 Stocks are often down in October. I don't see a constriction in credit
3736 2018-10-26 18:30:26 Unemployment in a downtrend has been positive in every situation (351 instances) except for the 4 when:

-VIX was elevated
-VIX was increasing
-Spreads were elevated 
-Stocks were above trend

All other instances / combinations, positive.

So million $ question may be US economy.

3741 2018-10-26 18:27:06 I migrated to this country 31 yrs ago. Father of 2, taxpayer and living the American dream. my stocks & 401k have gone up under Trump as they did under Obama. I’d give that all up to see this country return to decency, civility & normalcy. What would you give up for this country?

3743 2018-10-26 18:26:24 Don't apply conspiracies to reality. The market consists mainly of banks, sovereign fund, institutions & trading robots. All do it to make money. The point is, if you're going say stupid things ala Donald, that he is the reason for what stocks do, you have to be consistent.
3744 2018-10-26 18:25:38 Second, companies lack the ability to force their stocks to be counted as liquid in secondary markets, whereas governments have legal tender and other laws, plus an entire banking system, which efficiently manages the money markets.

3747 2018-10-26 18:23:28 Sec should also investigate this shorts too! I am sure they know people who bet the stocks going down as soon as the article is published.! clearly shorts are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy here, putting themselves in hot water! just waiting for the shorts being investigated
3748 2018-10-26 18:23:11 But to start, we should note that of course stock-issuing companies lack any method of compelling demand for their stocks, such as being able to levy taxes denominated in those stocks. That is one reason for their sensitivity to other market forces.
3749 2018-10-26 18:22:45 DYK Hunger-for-Yield Trades are in transition: Previously, fixed income returns were very modest so GIC refugees, bond investors & others flocked to safety stocks: telcos, utilities & pipelines.

#WallStreet
3755 2018-10-26 18:19:12 Despite the S&P 500's intraday recovery six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were still down at least 10 percent from their 52-week highs, including energy, materials and financials. Around three quarters of the index's stocks are also in a correction.
3756 2018-10-26 18:19:11 At some point people stop believing @jimcramer and his "thing of beauty" narratives about stocks that are trading at ~ 100x earnings. But yes - there's no reason why people should be any less credulous about AMZN or NFLX tech than they were a few months ago.
3757 2018-10-26 18:18:17 OMG, thank you @nouriel! Without your maniacal ranting and emotional  attacks, I never would have know that crypto is a scam. Phew, you saved me. brb, going to buy stocks now!

3761 2018-10-26 18:16:52 And after that one wonders why stocks are going down? .....
3762 2018-10-26 18:16:43 2/ looking on a 20 day chart shows a mixed bag of how the sector and stocks are being viewed: Some are at the top, some at the bottom, some at mid point. They are not trading together in GDX, GLD, GOLD, RGLD, NEM, ABX, SLV, etc.
3763 2018-10-26 18:15:45 And yet the stocks continue to tank.

3771 2018-10-26 18:14:02 Economy is not back on top. Stocks are dropping. We are heading for a recession. You can NEVER increase the economy that fast & expect it to work perfect especially when you do it causing a HUGE deficit. Who's paying that? The middle class? #VoteBlue

3777 2018-10-26 18:11:21 First, despite this rhetorical diversion, your equating of stocks and currency is a novel one to which neither heterodox nor orthodox economists subscribe.

3780 2018-10-26 18:10:40 All you ever do is shill... shouldn’t there be a word of caution when investing in these highly overvalued pot stocks?
3781 2018-10-26 18:09:40 I'm good with finance. My dad (a Silent Gen-er) was an accountant professor in his younger years and a self-employed doc when I was born, and I've been trading stocks for two decades.

3784 2018-10-26 18:08:50 They said the same thing the year that Big Ben came out and he went late middle of first round. Vice versa the years the stocks have been high on QBs nothing but high busts.

3789 2018-10-26 18:05:32 I don't ever do that intentionally, but sometimes some stocks get weeded out and the hedge side gets a little heavy, so I end up a tiny bit net short, but then I try to adjust and get it balanced again, so no dark side for me in retirement. ETR!

3828 2018-10-26 17:47:22 @jimcramer Is it possible that once we find the bottom that the opposite of what we're seeing now, that is the algos creating high supply of stocks without demand causing prices to crash, causes prices to rise quickly?

3834 2018-10-26 17:43:57 Tesla stocks are UP in case you hadn't noticed ... around $20 up in fact altho there has been a tiny amount of profit taking ... looks like no one wants to sell but a whole lot of people want to BUY
3835 2018-10-26 17:43:38 funny that a certain crypto dividend token which can't be diluted by more shares will most likely become the ground work for the next "stock market" with returns for the average person without fees and legal restraint. stocks may crash but wise people find the ground to build on

3846 2018-10-26 17:37:43 Sure! Buy the stock so they can sell theirs when it goes up and leave the common people taking the fall.  Typical investors.  They are manipulating the stocks to try and bring in common people to take their money.  Common people don't take stock from -600 to +400.

3849 2018-10-26 17:36:43 Fed's higher interest rates are causing stocks to fall. Trump wants to  audit or eliminate the Fed altogether. Days before mid-term would be a  strong buy as stocks should bounce back with a decent MEGA win.
3850 2018-10-26 17:36:18 Unfortunately the old adage about shorting stocks, or any asset if you're able, applies here:

Being early is the same thing as being wrong.

3855 2018-10-26 17:35:21 The conclusion on any bear market is that index funds track them all the way down. When they are bloated with momentum stocks, the momentum is downwards too.  An active manager can raise cash balances if that is his judgement.
3856 2018-10-26 17:34:52 “The poor earnings are reflecting a slowdown in growth, not a disastrous slowdown, but enough to take stocks down,” said Ilya Feygin, managing director at institutional brokerage firm WallachBeth.
3857 2018-10-26 17:34:30 No problem. Not sure where the $150 came from? 

Maybe I said that? I don’t remember.

I’m hoping with the right news, this MJ stock can crack the billion dollar market cap like many other MJ stocks. Billion cap is around $100 Price per share.
3858 2018-10-26 17:34:23 @AOTtrades My great TLRY options put yesterday that I boasted about?  Only sold half yesterday and lost what I made and $250 more today!!  Couldn't get a price first thing.  Lesson - only large and liquid stocks in future.

3860 2018-10-26 17:33:51 So why didnt big hits stocks go down?
3861 2018-10-26 17:32:59 I've been doing tons of business intelligence work in the #cannabis ecosystem. I'm not a stock broker but this is one of the stocks I'd personally buy FWIW....
3862 2018-10-26 17:31:32 I passed 5 a few days ago and barfed up some stocks.  I feel like I should be buying here, but damn it's hard.
3863 2018-10-26 17:31:30 If you ask me this question, I'd suggest you read The Complete Penny Stock Course by @ninja0n3 first. And watch a lot of @timothysykes video lessons. Be safe, be prepared!

3865 2018-10-26 17:31:06 Gonna make a photobooth and make my own stocks for storms
3866 2018-10-26 17:31:01 and what? you were saying bts was the cause of the big 3's stocks tumbling when in fact it's because they are publicly-listed companies in the stock market. expected when the world market is going through instability, or political/economical crisis.
3867 2018-10-26 17:30:50 My AMD stocks got dumped for no reason ! Had them forever, saw them goto $40 before INTHELL got evil ! This time hopefully will be MAGIC 7 nm. ;) IT man here !
3868 2018-10-26 17:30:37 Save it for the times when you need it. Additionally you could invest part of it in stocks if that is up your alley. Just don’t throw it away but save it up for the future for when you might have bigger expenses
3869 2018-10-26 17:30:18 #US stocks staggered back from a rout that took the S&P 500 Index into a correction, though major averages remained lower for the day. #Treasuries and #gold pared gains as demand for havens eased!

3871 2018-10-26 17:30:12 Stocks sink again, falling back into the red for the year
3872 2018-10-26 17:29:56 Adding to that, a big reason some continue to support him, in my experience, is bc their Stocks/retirement accounts continue to climb.
3873 2018-10-26 17:28:34 I would pretend to feel bad, but I'm managing while trading stocks and watching a movie.   I think you'll be okay

3878 2018-10-26 17:26:07 Haha Microsoft revenue growth is solid. Amazon missed their Q3 targets. So did Google. Tech stocks are sliding.
3879 2018-10-26 17:25:53 The next 'crypto bull run' may not be in crypto. If you've been hyper-focused on, you've missed out on massive gains elsewhere. 

The NA Marijuana Index is up over 600% since 2/16. Not just one or two big names but but an across-the-board surge in marijuana stocks.

3881 2018-10-26 17:25:01 Forward p/e is a lot healthier then 2000. Stocks were 50% more expensive relative to earnings then today. Corps today are ridiculously profitable which supports valuations.

3883 2018-10-26 17:23:39 This company changes distributors frequently and does not settle their issues and leaves unsaleable stocks at their point. Every year their team changes. Totally unprofessional  company.

3889 2018-10-26 17:20:42 In what world is $QQQ down 1% a reason to think the party is going to continue? Stock market goes up, Fed tightens more = #stocks drop. IF the #Fed eases, you get what you want & stock market inflates more (but the market needs to crash first). This economy is sick bottom line.

3910 2018-10-26 17:13:15 imo swan dive event today is gone. tsla is too strong and gives confidence to all the bubble stocks.

3912 2018-10-26 17:11:43 What are the buying cheap stocks on the exchange as it plummets?  You can't go away fast enough.  Vote Democratic.
3913 2018-10-26 17:11:24 Remember: in all Tweets about market moves that quote SD's, there is nothing "standard" about market deviations.

A 3SD move in nature happens once in 300 yrs, a 3SD event in stocks happens all the time.

Do not rely on symmetric units in an asymmetric environment.
3914 2018-10-26 17:10:52 Invert. Stocks suck because investors don't care about Energy. 20 year lows as % of benchmarks. I believe that can and should change, but there's no denying they don't care and haven't for several years.
3915 2018-10-26 17:10:12 A few more of these, time to buy value stocks.  Classic end of cycle behavior - capitulation - value has been dead for so long, set to turn soon.
3916 2018-10-26 17:09:12 $amd nice recovery after the initial panic. Have been lucky buying stocks shortly after opening, after the emotional people freak out and sell. Bought/sold Amazon today turned out good. Waiting for AMD to bottom. When will Roku be safe?

3919 2018-10-26 17:06:33 My thinking is that they would invest money into crypto since stocks would be doing well and they might feel they have more of a disposable income to go into a higher risk asset class. Additionally if stocks are doing well presumably there are more jobs ,higher pay, etc

3935 2018-10-26 17:00:50 No, we’re screwed because of the inflated overcompensated economic optimism when Trump was elected.

3963 2018-10-26 16:50:33 I disagree. But you're free to your views. The RBI is not here to ensure your stocks do well just like they're not here to prop up the rupee every time it depreciates. Cleaning up bad debt is going to have costs and repercussions but in the long run, it's good.
3964 2018-10-26 16:49:02 Mortgage Bonds holding gains. Stocks lower, off worst levels. 10-yr yield 3.07%.
3965 2018-10-26 16:48:58 All by themselves, even moderately increasing interest yields undercut stock values, as more and more risk-averse investors move money from stocks to bonds.

Right now, stock prices are inflated 20-30% from reasonable levels, so a recession between now and 2020 is an odds-on bet.

3980 2018-10-26 16:39:41 Equity investors are such pussies.

Everything in my multiple watchlists (about 40-50 stocks) are red apart from $INTC $YUMC $TWTR $VZ and $LMT 

Apart from these every single stock I track is down today.....
3981 2018-10-26 16:38:33 @realDonaldTrump if you want to know why the stocks are down today it's because you're not acting presidential in a time of need. Also probably mostly because China and Russia are listening to your phone calls. You can deny like you always do but it falls on deaf ears
3982 2018-10-26 16:38:27 uy baka naman pwedeng unlimited stocks huhuhu
3983 2018-10-26 16:37:19 Guy. Real estate going up and down. Doesn’t matter. Stocks going up and down doesn’t matter. I’m not flipping house nor am I day trading
3984 2018-10-26 16:37:12 I understand its difficult to predict bottom snd low. But as i just hold stocks like PEL, eicher.. There are people who have bought and sold the same several times last few weeks , for huge profits, while iv only lost.
Losing my faith in long term investing!
3985 2018-10-26 16:36:42 I have a feeling #BIDS could well be one of the best performing stocks between now and Xmas 

Plus all my other holdings of course 
3986 2018-10-26 16:36:14 Sold off BB stocks first week of October thank the Lord!!
3987 2018-10-26 16:36:08 Stocks are volatile before elections. In other news, grass is green and sky is blue
3988 2018-10-26 16:34:52 Dollar reverses, goes negative, and the 10yr yield dives- (BOTH VERY STOCK MARKET POSITIVE), AND THAT is why stocks are well off their lows thus far for the day.
3989 2018-10-26 16:34:20 don't you think stocks are mostly declining because of lower profit expectations, which are driven by trade fears?
3990 2018-10-26 16:34:13 This behavior, along with the algos not selling as $AAPL crossed below the 50 DMA as they have done on almost all other Growth stocks, is a sign that $AAPL has finally been accepted from Growth into Value cohort.
3991 2018-10-26 16:33:49 Lotta stocks flipping green on the phone I'm calling an office. $RH and $CROX are both higher. Not traditional hubs of safety.
3992 2018-10-26 16:33:33 FANG stocks are getting crushed the hardest in this market downturn. This shouldn't be unexpected as those stocks had the most to fall, since their valuations were so high. Another reason why value investing and buying companies with a margin of safety is so important. #FANG
3993 2018-10-26 16:33:24 NASDAQ hustle b!tch, come get ya ass in stocks...
3994 2018-10-26 16:33:12 U.S. stocks early afternoon Friday 10/26/18: $DJIA -0.95% at 24,747.23, $SPX -1.28% at 2,671.01, $COMPQ -1.51% at 7,207.58, $RUT -1.35% at $1480.12.
3995 2018-10-26 16:32:50 In this volatile period, just adding small share positions to qual stocks. No options.
3996 2018-10-26 16:30:47 Nobody is saying it. But I’m guessing stocks will be crap until after Nov 6 b/c too many power brokers connected 2 Deep state, Fed Reserve, Media and politics who are corrupt. They’ll try 2 neutralize Trump’s growing advantage. Stock market is his key visible success factor!
3997 2018-10-26 16:30:34 Stocks going down
3998 2018-10-26 16:29:49 Sometimes there are jokes you hear over and over and they never cease to be funny. Listening to people say that stocks are now cheap based on next year's earning is one such joke. Amazed it never occurs to them that those earnings might just not be what they thunk. $SPX $NDX $IWM

4002 2018-10-26 16:28:57 Now DEC. rate hike is "off the table" because stocks are down a few % from all-time sky high valuations?

4010 2018-10-26 16:25:13 The best traders are not afraid of holding on to strong stocks, they are afraid of holding on to losing stocks.
4011 2018-10-26 16:24:31 The stocks have tanked all week. Maybe that didn't hurt YOU, But for my little stockpile account, that means I'm down under my initial investment AGAIN. My parents retired on fixed income also cut back spending when stocks R down. You're delusional.
4012 2018-10-26 16:23:55 Would've loved to say hi and intro. Hahaha, but was too busy shoutcasting. Would've snuck a dragon out for ya but stocks were limited. Hahaha
4013 2018-10-26 16:23:47 The static shows 43% stocks giving more than 15% return over 3 years. This can’t be cheap.
4014 2018-10-26 16:22:13 Interesting observation but I see no correlation between stocks and bitcoin. Sure there are some stock traders who want to play in crypto most of us are adopters of bitcoin and we are a whole different animal. We don't care about the stock market.
4015 2018-10-26 16:21:58 If it's working for u, then great. 

Typically diversification beyond 15-20 kills returns. 

Personally, i prefer 10 stocks with 10% each & hopefully different sectors. 

Bottomline - As long as the portfolio is beating the index over 6-7 years period, it's fine..
4016 2018-10-26 16:21:45 if stocks go unchanged, Treasuries are way off sides.......

4025 2018-10-26 16:16:58 @HedgeyeDDale @Hedgeye Great calls guys. Here’s my only issue NOW that most stocks 20% lower. Q4 Quad4 has 11 countries but Q1 has half that and many more back in quad 1 so with such a PB and protection for growth stocks as expensive as they tend to get how should we b so bearish
4026 2018-10-26 16:16:54 The markets are dropping.  Many gains have been wiped out.  This is all directly related to tech stocks and their censorship behavior.  A few tech stocks are making the res of the numbers look bad.  They've brought it on themselves/
4027 2018-10-26 16:16:53 Price: 200tk

So hurry up because stocks are limited.
4028 2018-10-26 16:16:30 There’s no particular pattern in seeing which stocks have declined significantly more than the drop in the overall S&P 500 index. #Market #WallStreet
4029 2018-10-26 16:16:19 Continue with SIP right? The “market” is still not attractive for lump sums. Some stocks are. On no parameter (P/E, premium to EMs) is market cheap to be aggressive. Put in some money cautiously - yes.

For skilled stock pickers this may be  irrelevant. For retail it isn’t.

4042 2018-10-26 16:13:26 Complicent, the market has not fully priced in the challenges and threats that Telsa is bound to face; and hence remains overpriced like other tech stocks
4043 2018-10-26 16:13:14 Yes because the obama and Clinton Presidency’s were both so badly run  Obama brought us back from the brink of another Great Depression, longest job growth streak ever, economy strengthened. Job growth & stocks have slowed under Trump. I know facts are tough for trumpers
4044 2018-10-26 16:13:06 "Vicar in the stocks at parish fête" shocker
4045 2018-10-26 16:12:55 Every investment is a not cakewalk you get a bouncers every now on then because market is unstable sometimes so you should adjust accordingly to the stocks and invest wisely.. So think twice before facing the Ball... #InvestmentKeFunde
4046 2018-10-26 16:12:44 you are baffling. You deny truth to advance your emotions. I own businesses in 2 states, in the housing business at that. Stocks are through the roof, people are flush with cash and building homes like never before. But, you just keeping hating him to make you feel better, hon.
4047 2018-10-26 16:12:23 1. Don't be biased with your winners, no stock is spared during correction, specially if the business is cyclical (Eg Avanti Feeds)
2. Don't wait for your stocks to recover once you have found that they are junk (Eg:- Donear Industries and SPTL)
3. Always keep some cash.
4048 2018-10-26 16:11:36 Bought some great stocks in the close of the market last night. @DowJones Missed out on a cocktail/award dinner but made a few grand so I am happy with that.#diversify #capitalmarkets

2. Buy quality stocks 
3. Buy at proper levels
4. Avoid media based and most talked stocks.
5. Keep cash in hand
6. It is not necessary that stock price will not go down after u buy
7. Don’t sell ur stock in loss till fundamentals are intact
4052 2018-10-26 16:10:15 @ReformedBroker yeah...whenever I see a "fair" value target from Morningstar or CFRA, I see it as a price that my mother would have paid. I tried looking for entries on fair value, and I could never get in to the stocks that actually had any growth.

Until we have 2-3 earnings cycles for US multistaters(with new pubcos coming), its impossible to judge who is executing
And...stocks are volatile
4056 2018-10-26 16:09:36 What is the market saying when most stocks on your watchlist(s) look identical and are trading below the 55 Ema & 100 Sma?
4057 2018-10-26 16:09:20 De suba, todas. Stocks, intención de siembra, demanda. La cuestión es quién tiene espalda para seguir aguantando algo que cosechaste hace 3 meses, a estas tasas
4058 2018-10-26 16:07:43 Stocks are tumbling and wages are flat. At least your largest donors got a tax cut, though.

4063 2018-10-26 16:06:22 Lol October is usually the worst month for stocks.

Why do liberals who don't invest think they know so much about the stock market?

Trading days aren't linear. There are dips all the time.

I have more confidence investing now than at any other time.
4064 2018-10-26 16:06:16 I think you could say that for all MJ stocks......
4065 2018-10-26 16:05:16 So I have a list of five stocks that are value driven, value opportunities , have cash and decent and aligned management. Can’t do anything with them as I am sitting on paper losses across the board. So, timing gods pls awaken and assist for once. Much obliged
4066 2018-10-26 16:05:15 ....Confidence lost in currecncy, bonds, you'll see a selloff in bonds and stocks. Only place for all that cash to go is into commodities.

4086 2018-10-26 15:59:47 I would if I had money! I rather have stocks in my account than cash. Sounds like a bad idea for the past 10 days, but it was an amazing idea to use all my cash last year (still up by 18% over the past 12 months :-) ).  today is always the second best timing to invest.
4087 2018-10-26 15:59:36 .@BobPisani says the Market is “so stupidly oversold”… that and $2.75 will get you on the Subway in NYC. Let’s keep an eye on our key $VIX levels here $25.2-$26.72. Above is likely another leg lower in $SPY, below can bounce Stocks.

4095 2018-10-26 15:56:18 I think the overly bearish sentiment and the hard sell off of some tech stocks this past week show a green coming week. Outlook hasn’t changed at all
4096 2018-10-26 15:56:06 A text to my sister August 29th, 2018. I said, "I think a downturn in stocks is coming. The big players buy low and sell high." She said, concerning cashing out a 401k, "You have to pay income taxes on it at regular rate plus a percentage penalty"..."I'll have to ride it out".

4098 2018-10-26 15:55:20 The Dow has been climbing rapidly the past 18 months mostly on the tech stocks Facebook ,Amazon etc , those stock prices have got too far ahead of earnings , which means if they don’t grow earnings the share prices will fall .

4100 2018-10-26 15:54:57 Under Trump, our portfolio has more value b/c of rising stocks, we have more jobs, we are respected around the world, our trade deficit is looking better, illegal immigration is getting crushed. Under Obama, all of this was the opposite. Or can’t you see that?
4101 2018-10-26 15:54:56 Il est vrai que ce jeu rencontre un franc succès! Mais ne vous inquiétez pas, les stocks seront très vite renouvelés ;)
4102 2018-10-26 15:54:11 The £17 & £30 Himalayan salt lamps are back in stock. Get yours while stocks last!
4103 2018-10-26 15:54:03 I would bet that anyone that had money in stocks last year became richer. The UBS report probably mentions most of these “riches” are unrealized, and a lot of them have recently been lost.

4117 2018-10-26 15:51:23 Each impulse higher has required a digestion via pullback - this one seems different because the impulse came with hawkish comments from Powell that nobody was ready for - I think stocks desperately want verbal soothing from the Fed if rates are up here
4118 2018-10-26 15:51:20 i can't believe i just had a mini lecture about stocks lol don't believe in everything i say 
4119 2018-10-26 15:51:08 Maybe that's why there stocks rocketed and you're Blimping lol.
4120 2018-10-26 15:50:44 Anirudh has repeatedly said that stocks will rise and fall around oct. They will steadily rise from 8th November. Read his tweets and retweets. Dnt jump the gun and discredit a person who os ardently followed by many.
4121 2018-10-26 15:50:29 Would’ve loved if you had discussed CARE & Kaveri with Mohnish. The others have already been discussed several times. Unless there is some silent period because he has recently added those stocks.
4122 2018-10-26 15:50:28 "It" announces bump stocks more effective.
4123 2018-10-26 15:50:25 Laughable/ the tariffs are sinking stocks
4124 2018-10-26 15:50:21 Stocks are tanking !!!
4125 2018-10-26 15:50:19 Stocks falling, 401K crashing, tariffs causing rising prices of goods, rising interest rates, down housin market, a tax cut for the rich and wages stagnant. The Trump economic policies are a house of cards about to crumble.
4126 2018-10-26 15:50:19 Since I don’t own stuff below the 200d, it’s slim pickings right now. Very few stocks, no shiny metals, no bonds... 

US dollar, oil, and a ton of inverse ETF’s. Meh...

4129 2018-10-26 15:49:41 A ver, nadie hace asesorías financieras “gratis”, sobre instrumentos financieros internacionales (derivados, bonos, stocks...). Porque solo en un cuento de hadas, estos son fáciles de valorar.
4130 2018-10-26 15:49:34 Obvious top-patterns on various indices and individual stocks. I doubt this is just a correction.
4131 2018-10-26 15:49:12 I would suggest purging losers in your portfolio and stick with the best of breed stocks, especially ones with an underlying bid (big stock buybacks, M&A potentials, activist investors, insider buyers, etc)
4132 2018-10-26 15:49:07 "Never underestimate the replacement power of stocks within a reflationary spiral."
4133 2018-10-26 15:49:03 1. "Buy on rumor. Sell on news."
2. This is the way major stocks behave when the economy is about to slide into recession.
4134 2018-10-26 15:48:46 From three digits to one now.
Very few stocks left......and it’s only been a week plus 
4135 2018-10-26 15:48:32 where can i trade stocks
4136 2018-10-26 15:48:07 I thought $AMZN $GOOGL dragging market down. 

But many stocks fell more than $GOOGL. 

Doesn't make a sense.

Then....nothing makes a sense in stock market these days.
4137 2018-10-26 15:48:00 There is really no correlation between a company’s actual performance and its stock price. This is part of the great fraud that the market represents. 

It’s important to understand this if holding stocks.

4140 2018-10-26 15:47:25 Imma get an economics or business certificate and learn about investment and stocks  
4141 2018-10-26 15:47:23 eh avoja...i buyback "restringono" il mercato insieme agli ETF, lo rendono più concentrato e resiliente, liberano liquidità ai venditori che spesso la reinvestono nuovamente in stocks, si crea un circolo "virtuoso"...finora era "buy AMZ sell everything"...oggi no dopo trimestrale

4164 2018-10-26 15:42:39 @Varneyco could a extremely wealthy group of democrats control enough influence on Wall Street as well as stocks crash the stock market on purpose.   Like George Soros crashed the pound in England???
4165 2018-10-26 15:42:34 Great! what does this gap mean in all stocks intraday just happened?Thanks
4166 2018-10-26 15:42:31 Is it just me or was the stock market able to turn when long bonds finally pushed higher? I know the timing wasn't exact but it seems to me that stocks need bonds to rally when it gets ugly. Makes me wonder if stocks can rally much without bonds also pushing higher.
4167 2018-10-26 15:42:23 Create something better than twitter and watch their stocks fall.
4168 2018-10-26 15:42:14 More important is sir which stocks will outperform the market in next one month , one year and MOST importantly in 5 years....short term is passe !

4172 2018-10-26 15:41:12 Worth noting that stocks, on a total return basis, increased each year under Obama. Live by the specious casual relationship, die by the specious casual relationship
4173 2018-10-26 15:41:04 My retirement account is down >11% YTD. I guess I didn't own enough shares of stocks that did buybacks.

4179 2018-10-26 15:40:36 Unfortunately the same was said in 2011, 2015 and 2016. IMHO,  the stocks will NOT be "allowed" (by the central planners) to fall below a predetermined level. Thanks to the CBs, now the stock market = the economy

4184 2018-10-26 15:39:46 @cfa_m  Equitas Holdings' price history is hardly for 30 months. As you're knowledgeable  about technicals of stocks, you could see that its price history is  nothing to write home about. And India is a land of plenty.
4185 2018-10-26 15:39:35 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
4186 2018-10-26 15:39:24 Well the pennystock market is lacking volume and there's a lot of easy shorts recently on spy and higher stocks. It's less stressful because you don't get squeezed or tanked on so quickly but still emotions can mess you up like mine did today. Was up $100 now down 50
4187 2018-10-26 15:38:57 Global economic growth is down because of Trump's trade wars and the bump in the Dow is due to two trillion in borrowed money used to buy back stocks that today's young people will be paying back all their lives.
4188 2018-10-26 15:38:41 The stock market is getting more volatile, which is nerve-racking for investors. However, remember that bitcoin was close to $20,000 at the end of 2017, and is now around $6,400. THAT is painful volatility. #stocks #investing

4193 2018-10-26 15:36:59 @cfa_m Equitas Holdings' current market price is Rs 97, which is well below its April 2016 IPO issue price of Rs 110. As you know, stocks fall for a reason. In this case, it's risky considering the negative sentiment of general market, specifically toward the financials.

Stocks are tanking. 
The Nasdaq is down 3.4%, the S&P 500 has entered a correction.
4241 2018-10-26 15:25:27 Seeing many Buy orders coming in now from retail peeps on my backend for FAANG stocks.  Retail still in heavy denial.

4243 2018-10-26 15:25:10 Stocks are down quite a bit on global sell off heading into weekend, as Amazon & Google disappoint.  DOW down 400 points and NASDAQ down nearly 200.  Yields have dropped to 3.07%, dropping below 25 DMA.  MBS up 22bps, improvement in Mortgage Rates today.
4244 2018-10-26 15:24:41 No, i seem to believe that stocks are PORTIONS of the actual company.  And when those portions lose value, the company loses value.  To maintain wages and prices, the company must maintain value.  The company loses money when their stock prices go down.
4245 2018-10-26 15:24:37 Just added T-bonds for clients to the $Vegan Growth Portfolio.  Only a starter position as the expected rotation to bonds is very early IMO.   Even if stocks rebound by January I still expect the Fed to continue to tighten credit.
4246 2018-10-26 15:24:21 I think Far resources $FAT $fat.ca will see 7 cents today. Very sad people got scammed into this pump and dump dog shit!

4247 2018-10-26 15:24:14 S&P 500 P/E @ 21 now. This is under the 22.5 lvl of April. As per Graham words ideally P/E at around 12 is fairly priced stocks.
4248 2018-10-26 15:24:02 Been focusing on OTC lately, but couple NASDAQ stocks of note that has been steady despite the sell-off, $BILI, and an illiquid Chinese name in $VIOT, among others.
4249 2018-10-26 15:24:02 I see nature stocks, it just looks like it's positioned the same.

4256 2018-10-26 15:22:28 Yes, but if you try al Qahtani, he might say something in the public court record about Saudi government involvement in 9/11.  Resulting outrage could raise our taxes if we stop selling 100s of billions in arms to Saudis.  Keep detainees at GTMO, keep wallets fat & stocks high.
4257 2018-10-26 15:22:19 RBI did nothing new. As bull frenzy doesn't pay heed to any reason bear mkt panic find 1001 reasons to drive down prices of the stocks. U r senior enough to know this simple fact. So plz don't lend ur voice to the growing chorus of RBI bashing.
4258 2018-10-26 15:21:56 Think again, Kudlow  STOCKS falling due to faulty TAXCUTS & TARRIFS  policies. Democrats fixed & grew economy after @GOP & Bush tanked it into recession.

4261 2018-10-26 15:20:27 With Stocks under so much pressure will be difficult to see $TWTR rally, but one can hope.
4262 2018-10-26 15:20:15 Loving my shorts though! Retail here believing stocks undervalued while it is oil that is temporarily too high. Will adjust soon enough.
4263 2018-10-26 15:19:54 Thanks for sharing . Really good stocks to be looked from long term
4264 2018-10-26 15:19:18 And buying back stocks is the first step in stabilizing the company so that they can then lower prices and give back to the employees and community.  Walmart saves the american people $120 billion a year by having low prices, and they save more for their employees with discounts
4265 2018-10-26 15:19:16 pot stocks are actually holding up today.... may see a little wave up out of this range.
4266 2018-10-26 15:19:00 Difficult to agree with you when just a few come true. Your prediction on stocks going up from 10th oct was foolish. Why don’t u also accept failures as the first step to prove ur genuine. Then we count on the + and -

4270 2018-10-26 15:17:41 no real scare unless the Nasdaq where all the hot money is becomes up sub 5% YTD.
the rest of stocks are in the hands of legit investors (eternal bag holders). these guys don't get scared below 20% decline.
4271 2018-10-26 15:17:38 Yet, U stocks are being shredded to pieces right now. Seems U price has been parked at 27.50-28.00 for many weeks. Needs to move on..
4272 2018-10-26 15:17:33 Thus far called the exact top in tech stocks, $XLE getting crushed, about a day prior to it, yesterday's exact top of the panic rally, the bottom in gold miners, followed by the top in gold miners earlier in the year, and the bottom in platinum.
4273 2018-10-26 15:17:30 $TSLA like the way it is acting while this stock market correction plays out. Now is a good time to find stocks that are holding up during the slaughter.

4287 2018-10-26 15:13:48 #stocks if you are waiting to buy (sell), know that this market can move 1% in a few minutes.  There’s a lot of volume today but big program trades could still overwhelm it. Also, a lot of the algos key on same levels and all buy or sell at same time.

4297 2018-10-26 15:11:42 Your thoughts on why?  I have 2 thoughts but not sure if it correlates to stocks.
4298 2018-10-26 15:11:38 Today is definitely the day to load up on $SNAP vs FANG stocks.  Maybe the entire stock market takes a digger, but we'd bet $SNAP outperforms most all other stocks in the next 5-8 years, if not the next 5-8 days/weeks/months.

4303 2018-10-26 15:10:19 And frauds and sand stocks i.e people don't know what to do and theyre taken some profits in their short book. You better hope theirs a big SI in your longs today or else their wont be any bids
4304 2018-10-26 15:10:14 Don't see any support until 2533. I can totally see a move down to 2263 now. My bias on stocks is also for the first time in several years bearish.

4349 2018-10-26 15:03:25 Economy 103: This ties in with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s assertion that the Fed would not step in to prop up the stock market unless it was a sustained collapse that was bad enough to impact the REAL economy, specifically consumer spending. Expect stocks to drop +75%

4353 2018-10-26 15:02:05 Economy 102: Letting stocks collapse will force capital into bonds, thus forcing yields lower. That process is now underway. If U think Fed will step in, you’re wrong.

4362 2018-10-26 15:01:04 When you take your trade, look for : 
1) where to take profit
2) if you're short look where sellers will jump in(so possible res on pops)
3) see if prints on tape are majority red 
4) volume imbalance for sell  
5) daily supp + pivots as tp

4383 2018-10-26 14:58:49 Haven’t heard Trump or Trump lemmings touting the economy recently. Stocks in negative territory for the year, interest rates up and 23% tariffs set to kick in at the first of the year. I guess lying about support for preexisting conditions is the best they can do.

4407 2018-10-26 14:54:29 Very interesting trading... Been watching you trade higher priced stocks and was always sort of curious as to why. But I suppose even with 50 shares, on a $1.5 trade thats still a great gain. Nice work! Do you find higher priced stocks less stressful?

4414 2018-10-26 14:53:20 "The economy" is not a monolith. GDP and stocks can go up and down at the exact same time that 80% of the population is worse off. Not recognizing this is exactly what leads to Trump.

4444 2018-10-26 14:47:59 Always buy great stocks when irrelevant noise causes a sell off. Amazon’s fundamentals are sound and they still have lots of room to grow. Never bet against a growing giant like $AMZN! Same goes for $TSLA. Never bet against determined CEO like Elon Musk!

4449 2018-10-26 14:46:57 Its my focus thats not right when I have to much going on. As you say, 1-2 stocks top and watch only them. I will get there, just so damn hard some days 
4450 2018-10-26 14:46:15 Believe it or not I actively use most of them. Stocks, Books, and iTunes are the only ones I rarely ever open. But mostly I keep it stock because I’m so used to where things are when I do use it. Muscle memory.

4460 2018-10-26 14:44:03 What we are seeing in the #US now, is that #Tech stocks, which have been the main driver of the bull market in 2018 so far, are starting to underperform (high) market expectations. In my opinion, the correction will continue.
4461 2018-10-26 14:43:58 I'm not aware of anyone who's figured that out. Given where St. George's Island is, I'd guess around Lower Water/Barrington. It's considered pretty accurate, though I'd question the balance of any drawing that only marks "gallows" and "stocks" in the main settlement...

4464 2018-10-26 14:43:47 So false I cannot even begin. That's disgusting that you are even allowed to state in a social media platform. There is no substantial evidence in anyone of your claims. The DOW which is compromised of 38 stocks, almost never affects any retirement plan. Average salaries r up.
4465 2018-10-26 14:43:30 Two big numbers today:  3.5%, 3.7%.  The former is #GDP for Q3 (first read), the latter is the average intraday volatility for US stocks the past five days (spread between high and low intraday prices).

4482 2018-10-26 14:40:37 I predict that early next week the #DAX will be below 11.000 Points: 
So since January the #Dax dropped below 13.500, 13.000, 12.500, 12.000, 11.500... . 
Do you see a trend? I do!
Even solid numbers by the likes of #Alphabet no longer lift markets.

4485 2018-10-26 14:39:55 excuse me?  i have lost 40k or more in the stock market this year--are you kidding?  when is the republican party going to find out why the stocks are tanking in spite of all the "good" economic news.  i smell globalist rats.
4486 2018-10-26 14:39:09 The fact of the matter is when the stock market is doing good someone is getting screwed be it the customers or the employees of those that publicly trade their stocks. Because the whole premise is maximizing earnings. #TheStockMarketIsEvil

4494 2018-10-26 14:38:21 Started a position in $TLRY with price of $111.07. Why? 

-The price is relatively near support

Remember, rule #1: Looking for moving stocks.

Why it may not work? Overall market is not doing too well.

4500 2018-10-26 14:37:01 No problem Phil. I recommend creating your own plan each morning and write it down. Your own plan is the one that fits you best. I look for stock either gapping up or down. Those are the stocks that are going to move the most. Look for previous support/resistance.
4501 2018-10-26 14:36:57 Don´t you think that the price of these stocks were also part of the ¨expectations are in the stratosphere´, hence this drop in price is a simple correction?

4513 2018-10-26 14:34:39 Chris look at the bond market, I’m not saying your wrong here but I’m betting the fed buys bonds putting a floor under the market and stocks go higher. The 10 year yield is dropping fast, look for yourself. If this were the meltdown the 10 year would be exploding.
4514 2018-10-26 14:34:39 All stocks may be cheap today (or in some cases costlier :)) if you project them 10 -15 years into the future.....But the important thing that is missed is 10-15 years consists of getting through 3650-5000 days of emotions and noise and opportunities to buy cheaper

4546 2018-10-26 14:28:19 Barron's made interesting point this morning. History shows Junk bonds usually move in sync w/small-cap stocks. So when the Russ 2000 is tumbling it pays to check junk bonds. The R-2000 has dropped 12% so far in Oct, junk bonds under 2%. Suggests this is a correction.

4548 2018-10-26 14:27:24 MCO (Moody's) down $10, cleanly through 200-day. If there was one stock that would be a bond bear mkt tell, it would be MCO. Mr Buffett still owns, but he was panning MCO after '08 and sold a bunch near $30 (I think). MCO tested 200-wk m/a early '16, like a lot of stocks. (none)

4559 2018-10-26 14:25:04 Yep, if you are good at reading market indexes, and not comfortable with things such as options, you can always buy stocks/etfs that short bullishness too. Definitely was worth shorting technology sector the last few weeks, how much longer it can sustain, I'm scared of the answer
4560 2018-10-26 14:24:57 Yeah, but guess what. Rising interest rates, tariffs, and transportation costs will drive down stocks/reduce wealth effect and simultaneously increase cost of goods. This run is short-lived, unfortunately.

but you don't have to swing at ANY of them!

You wait for the best ones—then swing for the fences!

LIFE'S LIKE THAT—ever-pitching you PEOPLE and opportunities.

4593 2018-10-26 14:15:09 @Varneyco every other day stocks go wildly down then back up. It appears possible that stock traders are manipulated to buy techs at highs by those who had bought techs at lows and sold at the highs. I smell RATS like SOROS and others. SEC should investigate @realDonaldTrump
4594 2018-10-26 14:14:55 I saw the Amazon & Alphabet stocks going very down also.
4595 2018-10-26 14:14:33 Or is it our strong military? What is so bad about what is going on now? The stock market decline now? It’s called a correction. After this correction is over stocks will go even higher that ever. What is it that’s so bad?

Rich billionaires own the company

The stocks are for those who have no money lol

Whether the stocks lose value or not, THEY ARE STILL BILLIONAIRES 

Youre just being an elitist cuck even though you arent a billionaires,piece of shit
4606 2018-10-26 14:13:19 For my part, I think this sell off is investors repositioning and realizing not all stocks will have profit growth next year. The tide that lifted all boats in past 24 months is gone, and some companies have real cost issues and volume issues. But others are fine & economy fine
4607 2018-10-26 14:12:53 Heads up. Earnings peaked in 2Q18. Inflation is now eating into margins. This means inflation has become a problem for stocks. Also US economy is rolling over. Latest report is UGLIER than media letting on.

4614 2018-10-26 14:12:29 History seems to show that Stocks can rise with Interest Rates up to a point. It appears that the more buoyant Economic Backdrop that enables higher Rates trumps the drag from those Rate Rises. In UK/Europe Rates still extremely low.

4644 2018-10-26 14:05:33 The big post-election year last year was anomalous {pent-up animal spirits}. That is generally the worst year for stocks wrt the election cycle; the midterm year is next weakest.

4647 2018-10-26 14:04:38 This has become a likely scenario, I just wanted to ask what triggered this tweet at this moment, was it some new bit of information perhaps that you could share? Or maybe the recent trading (bond/stocks) events?
4648 2018-10-26 14:04:37 Well, GDP at 3,5% vs 3,3% is a sign that the econ is not struggling. Stocks however, are suffering for sure and esp. the home-builders sector and existing homes sales are all licking the floor. A rate spike will cont to hurt this sector and when the housing mkt is down, oh boy...

4727 2018-10-26 13:47:17 Very true. The leaders in an emerging industry don't often end up being the leaders as the technology becomes established. The airline industry is a perfect example. Investors in early airline stocks would have lost a fortune.

4730 2018-10-26 13:44:49 U.S. stocks rebounded sharply yesterday after a bruising start to the week. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average moved back into the black for the year. The Nasdaq Composite rallied 3%, continuing a period of intense volatility for popular technology stocks.

4808 2018-10-26 13:17:54 In times like these, the ETFs of broader indices are a bit safer. Some thematic ETFs are concentrated, and can get hit harder than an individual stock. As they will have some stocks are already weak inside.

4821 2018-10-26 13:14:19 #stocks bought a bunch of different 3x long etfs in premarket (not much liquidity). It’s been an easy trade his week buying dips and selling the bounce backs. This may be different based on poor bellwether tech earnings. Still, I think we bounce post-election if not today.
4822 2018-10-26 13:13:12 So let me get this straight..  interest rates need to go up for stocks to go up again?

Well I am not the one that voted No on banning bump stocks and raising the age to purchase firearms,you did. NRA must love you for that. I am however a supporter of the 2nd amendment. @PeterSchorschFL @jacobogles

Capital One Investing is moving accounts to E-Trade.
Already had an account with E-Trade a while back, lost everything because the charge for Not making trades regularly.

4860 2018-10-26 12:51:18 Brexit is priced in..  UK shares have only kept pace because the pound is so weak. 

The parabolic stocks have warranted it. Their profits are gigantic. (Amazon) and they lift the whole index with their weighting. Most consumer sectors are far from parabolic.
4861 2018-10-26 12:51:09 Blame trade wars all you want, BUT I will always come back to the insane valuations of 3 stocks $googl $amzn $nflx and the RE-allocation of indexes by the S&P. NO coincidence this madness ALL started then. think about it.

Today's huge sell off is based in that too.

4863 2018-10-26 12:50:11 My take. The markets over reacted. The stocks down to nearly one time book. And the company S best years start now. Valuation should recover.

Is the market's glass half full or half empty? You can pick holes in the GDP but then, the US still remains the best major econ of the bunch. USD isn't doing much but stocks might have other ideas. Bond yields have bounced a touch though.

4887 2018-10-26 12:41:18 For all those people like @TheRabbitHabbit who said trump was the greatest bc “stocks are killing it,” there’s a reason any intelligent human being never rested their argument on the stock market until after the fact. You’re all officially dumb now, only diff is, you now know it
4888 2018-10-26 12:41:07 Happy for you.  Truly am.  Tell me how your retirement accounts did from 2008-2016?  I know I was banking then too.  401k's didn't rise overnight.  They were not low, pre-2017.  I had returns at 10-12%. BTW, auto stocks were down double digits yesterday.
4889 2018-10-26 12:41:05 Then price of good quality stocks that went beyond intrinsic value wasn't wealth either. Often, I feel that value investing proponents are not true to the method. Else we would have seen big cash positions automatically over the last 2 yrs which we didn't

4891 2018-10-26 12:40:33 The Fed is not going to rescue stocks As repeatedly warned throughout 2018, the Fed is FAR more concerned about BONDS, than stocks.
When stocks collapse, investors lose money. When bonds collapse, entire countries go broke.
4892 2018-10-26 12:40:30 What's that old saying about buying when others are fearful & selling when they are confident?! Is this one of those times in the market where panic has set in and a bounce is imminent?

If I want to improve the strategy for accumulating stocks in this down market, what  books should I read? Ur answer would be much helpful. Thanks
4894 2018-10-26 12:40:19 Jim Bianco @biancoresearch said in yesterday's conference call that the #Fed will be slow to respond to a decline in the stock market, unlike 2016.  I agree with him. So stocks will fall until we find the level of the #Powellput be it -20%, -25% or -50%.

4966 2018-10-26 12:11:30 and beyond?  perfectly normal for stocks to go through periods of "growing into valuation" esp as growth moderates, especially after a 5-6x move for a company this size.
4967 2018-10-26 12:11:19 Problem for Fed is “data” is a lagging indicator. That is why they’re always late to the party. Market prices are the leading indicator and two thirds of global stocks are in a bear market.

4995 2018-10-26 12:02:01 When bear markets start Wall Street perma-bulls say to buy the dip, as it's just a correction.  Once the correction is officially declared to be a bear market, they say it's too late to sell as stocks have already fallen too much and that a new bull market is about to begin.
4996 2018-10-26 12:02:00 Many people tell you in bear markets to be more defensive and buy value names ..blah blah blah You know you can short stocks too right? Bear markets provide some of the biggest $$$$ Dont be afraid Run to that light  embrace it    $SPY $AMZN

5017 2018-10-26 11:47:47 When market sentiment turns sour, even the sweetest stocks get chewed up and spit out. It’s an ugly truth. It is why stops are important. Set them, and use them to rake off profits.
5018 2018-10-26 11:47:45 Your not winning. Stocks are dropping, healthcare is almost doubled, gas is at it's highest in 4 years, which made food rise to an all time high. I think fact checkers have everything right on the money.

5029 2018-10-26 11:43:50 OK, I'm back on twitter! The 8:30 GDP numbers are going to disappoint, causing stocks to spike in hopes that the Fed has changed his mind. Side issue: a fed president is going on bloomberg at 8:00AM which is very unusual timing...
5030 2018-10-26 11:43:49 Currently, in Ukraine, there is a rise in demand prices for sunflower  seeds stimulated by a high demand from oil-crushing enterprises, which  are making large stocks of raw materials for uninterrupted operation, APK-Inform reports.
5031 2018-10-26 11:43:22 When you sell your stocks then they go down 
5032 2018-10-26 11:41:57 Hard to say it is a good looking chart in its present form.... one the other side of the coin, there is a reason we have terms like "false breakout" and "false breakdown". Many charts looked really ugly/similar in early Feb 2016 and stocks rallied hard.  All TBD in 2018.
5033 2018-10-26 11:40:58 It's crypto, not stocks..
5034 2018-10-26 11:40:53 I agree. Still positive that You are interested about Tokmanni. I have some company stocks.
5035 2018-10-26 11:40:43 It is but the stocks are not as down and out as they were in 2015-2016 so I wasn't sure.
5036 2018-10-26 11:40:18 It’s not the first time that people literally make sh*t up to try and explain why some group of stocks is moving!
5037 2018-10-26 11:39:38 Yep, I am still holding. I think dilution is part of the landscape for small cap biotech stocks. What they are doing is smart because they put themselves in a better financial position. The move reminds me a bit of $RLYP.

5041 2018-10-26 11:37:46 Overall, stocks are trending lower.
Fear, however, is up sharply with demand for fear in every Republican ad driving its market breakout.

5055 2018-10-26 11:29:24 A few months ago I used to love stocks tanking premarket as often they would spend the rest of the trading day in a slow easy climb back up. Some of the best trading days were those.
5056 2018-10-26 11:28:19 Yes. It’s about where they will be distributing their unsold items. I’ve seen industries using the stocks for ‘gifting’ but amz outlet is more lucrative and easier to ‘measure’.

5058 2018-10-26 11:27:26 The stock market isn't a reflection on how everyday Americans are doing or how the economy is doing. 

Giant corporations and wealthy individuals received a huge tax cut and they've purchased stocks. Which inflates the stock market. That's called a bubble.

5078 2018-10-26 11:14:32 We’ve seen a big re-rating in tech stocks but as far as I know nobody’s talking about job cuts yet.
5079 2018-10-26 11:14:32 $AMZN down 9% in pre-market. Maybe the turn in value will be less about a turn in value and more about relative underperformance of large cap tech and mega growth stocks vs. many value names, which I guess is a turn in value.

5082 2018-10-26 11:13:42 Indeed the 'Party of Business' actively now destroying the very thing it prides itself on. They'll be Nationalising fishery stocks next and Steel manufacturing. Thats why they're so conflicted, they probably haven't slept in months!
5083 2018-10-26 11:13:35 Techs and high beta stocks yes But would expect with the imminent release of a good set of GDP numbers for consumer staples, Utilities and other defensive stocks to do well. It is all about stock selection (sector positioning)....

5094 2018-10-26 11:07:12 Happy to see Ruias losing Essar Steel. Ruias may have built good assets for the nation and for themselves, but always caused great loss to small investors. Their stocks are always speculative grade. Investors lost heavily in OFCD settlement.
5095 2018-10-26 11:06:59 Considering the previous months and the development of the price, I'd say this is actually a very reasonable place to be. It's hard to predict what would actually happen, but with TWICE's comeback just around the corner it's possible that the stocks would raise a little in value.
5096 2018-10-26 11:06:17 #RT @meirbarak: @greg13641886 @amirb2704 LUV is a well known company. Popular large-cap stocks usually find buyers after a gap-down due to their 'cheap price' .
5097 2018-10-26 11:06:02 Not only oil stocks panicking actually :).
5098 2018-10-26 11:05:40 To be honest, in JYP's case they had their peak in September and October. The company's stocks were gradually increasing in value over the year, starting at barely 12000 won per stock. Even after the global market sell-off, their stock price right now is at 30000 won.
5099 2018-10-26 11:05:21 Too early to call the end of Tech... Rotation to value style stocks is not yet decisive, what is decisive is the emergence of a defensive bias versus cyclicals and the convergence of US stocks to the global trend
5100 2018-10-26 11:05:11 On a personal note. Tons of hype around #marijuana stocks due to the extension of legalization for medical purposes to the general public. Like tobacco, this product is damaging to public health & "stunts" spiritual development. 

Try "#graphene technology" investment instead.
5101 2018-10-26 11:04:19 @TheBullBull Sir, How do you identify which stocks to play during the day. How to screen stocks? Please advise if you can. I know in one of your earlier tweets you had mentioned you would be sharing. Waiting eagerly.
5102 2018-10-26 11:03:45 Thanks Rahul bhai for sharing your view on markets and stocks
5103 2018-10-26 11:03:43 I'm finally selling the last growth stocks I have. I'm out
5104 2018-10-26 11:03:40 Will someone please remind #WallStreet : \ |  pundits that it's October, there are threats at the border, suspicious packages and a heated midterm election. Sure, markets hate uncertainty; but, stocks will rise (at least) another 10% in the coming 6 months despite Fed rates. BUY!
5105 2018-10-26 11:03:39 Which online book store stocks African Writers' series?

5108 2018-10-26 11:02:30 All this is temporary. Sooner or later volatility will dry down and I will  move back to what I have doing for the majority of  my trading career - Long in low float stocks for explosive moves.

5110 2018-10-26 11:01:41 Global stocks have lost $15 trillion in market capitalization since January. That's FOUR TIMES the quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve since 2008. Let that sink in. #stocks

5118 2018-10-26 10:57:18 2/2 advanced economies. The problem is that with EEM devastated, USA will be dragged down in growth fast too and on top of it they will face very strong USD headwind. This isnt about Trump or US stocks but eventually they will be forced to react (go dovish) or repeat 2008 mistake
5119 2018-10-26 10:57:15 The stock market is NOT the economy.   What percent of Americans own stocks?   And what percent of Americans can’t afford to buy a new set of tires with cash?  
5120 2018-10-26 10:56:21 Tech stocks were overbought, & there R a lot of overwrought worries the economy, but R economy is strong. People need put their $ somewhere. I think $ migrates from FANG to proven winners like $MCD, $CMG, & $PYPL, all big winners. I would buy these on the dip. #easy-money

If u keep watching the water falling down a waterfall ALL DAY, u WILL get exhausted!

Stop looking at gainers & losers list. Check portfolio stocks or watchlist at max. If a crashing stock isn't in either, it just doesn't matter!

5122 2018-10-26 10:55:41 I beg to differ. Not because I disagree in principle what you write but because Fed will have to care whats behind the falling stock markets.

5126 2018-10-26 10:52:37 Some quick math.
Pensions are now 60% exposed to stocks and assume an average yearly return of ~7%. Stocks are now negative for the year.  
Bonds too, but HTM let's say they are yielding 3% on average.
Whatever hole pensions were in is now much deeper.

5129 2018-10-26 10:51:19 GDP numbers should be good.

5217 2018-10-26 10:03:03 @YorkshireTea Hi there, I'm really struggling to find your Biscuit Blend anywhere. I've tried two Tesco stores in Yorkshire and a Waitrose in Central London. Do you have a list of where stocks it? Thanks! :)
5218 2018-10-26 10:02:15 So you think multinationals like Rio Zim are any different.  Their stocks are in London. Local small scale producers are better options that you should be proud of.

5224 2018-10-26 09:57:50 Re High Beta debate. IMO, a large part of this can be explained by beta being strongly correlated with positive stock return skewness. If you double sort on the two the high beta negative premium for "normal" stocks almost vanishes.

5229 2018-10-26 09:53:40 The market reactions to big tech’s 3rd quarter results is interesting.

- Alphabet, Google’s parent company, profit also exceeded expectations by 25%, but stocks fell by 3%;

5237 2018-10-26 09:50:26 Wonderful thanks, what has worked for me is to do spreads before results come out on liquid stocks and sell once the volatility cools. Let me know what you think of this?

5280 2018-10-26 09:26:18 you hear their is a market sell off?  it s not a sell off ,  it is the Dow Jones and similar computers being set up lower. All the stock prices are set by computer programmer during the night. The G20 gov. have ordered all stocks to be lowered to a minimum possible.
5281 2018-10-26 09:24:44 Often predicted wrongly like win for Hillary, US economy collapse under Trump, stocks market tumbling, collapse of Nigeria's economy in 2016 all turned out to be far wrong.

5282 2018-10-26 09:24:10 CFD brokers typically include after hours futures tracking in the charts, when no UK stocks are being traded on the LSE, so it can produce quite different spike levels when the US market causes that spike in the UK evening. E.g. March 18 low was 6866.94 in real time hours.
5283 2018-10-26 09:23:40 $AUDUSD struggles near 32-month lows, well below mid-0.7000s.  Japan stocks lower at close of trade; #Nikkei 225 down 0.39%

5337 2018-10-26 08:44:10 Stocks have been in a hyper bubble since the crash in 08 thanks to QE. It was unrealistic to think that the S&P 500 was going to cross the 30k Mark. With rate hikes expected at the end of the year it can even go below the 20k mark.
5338 2018-10-26 08:44:04 Curiously, only Canadian quoted stocks seem to be benefiting from this, presumably due to the presence of Largo and a high profile supporter.

5349 2018-10-26 08:38:47 This is not a new phenomenon. Markets keep switching from Euphoria to despair and back. Most who are trading in stocks just look at the price and the news. And trade basis that. I don't think anything has been done to decimate the business. If value is intact, price will recover.

5470 2018-10-26 07:13:52 The Morning Note
26 October 2018
South African markets closed in the green yesterday, boosted by broad based gains in banking and retail sector stocks. 119 stocks closed higher, 117 closed lower and 191 were unchanged.
What to watch today
5471 2018-10-26 07:12:28 Asset bubbles: This is when the prices of internet companies, stocks or houses become inflated beyond their sustainable value. The bubble itself sets the stage for a recession to occur when it bursts.
5472 2018-10-26 07:12:18 When the same govt retains power & FM/officials are the same, u need not consider stocks/investments. Because BSE started in 1977 at a base of 100. So, By 2027, it can be back at that value. Doesn't matter which Cos you choose, base level will be attained. Even EPF is taken over.

on a very serious note. ujjivan and equitas are down 30%+ today reason  being "they have to list the small bank co in 10 months plus timeline".

is there any other specific reason other than this? i mean other than general market carnage in financial stocks

5479 2018-10-26 07:05:46 You may have huge losses in small cap/midcap stocks. So are we. If you have only small caps in your PF problem is yours. And if you are in the Markets for long with Good stocks you know these are all temporary. So stop blaming irrelevant things.
5480 2018-10-26 07:04:56 Most investors sell stocks when the contraction is already well underway and don’t buy them until it’s too late.
5481 2018-10-26 07:04:32 So you basically got the stocks via open Interest analysis checklist way you doing or any other way you came across stocks.
5482 2018-10-26 07:03:19 Stocks are independent of each other. Amazon returning divs doesn't  mean alphabet wont. If David Silva returns divs on Saturday it means that Isco won't. Both mids... Isco price drops as a result of no divs!
5483 2018-10-26 07:03:19 Contraction: Economic growth slows but isn't negative. Stocks enter a bear market with a drop of 10% or more.
Trough:  Stocks lose over 20% The economy contracts. That signals a recession. Economic experts predict it will continue for years.
5484 2018-10-26 07:02:10 5 sessions in 7 months is hardly ‘across the network’. They should be in stocks in Waterloo every week.
5485 2018-10-26 07:02:02 Expansion: The economy grows a healthy 2 to 3 percent. Stocks enter a bull market. Peak: The economy grows more than 3 percent. Inflation sends prices up. There are asset bubbles. The stock market is in a state of "irrational exuberance."
5486 2018-10-26 07:00:35 Please please @ssharwood please don’t expose their gratuitous sockery... it’s the only way I ever get new stocks of socks. I’ve got four pairs from @ZachNelson in my top drawer. My kids call them billionaire sox... though obviously they have confused them with Larry’s.

5493 2018-10-26 06:54:50 Bonds affect the stock market because they both compete for investors' dollars. Bonds are safer than stocks, but they offer a lower return. As a result, when stocks go up in value, bonds go down.

India’s Stock Market Collapse -

“The rout sweeping global equities pushed *all 50 stocks in India’s NSE Nifty 50 Index below their 50-day moving average prices* on Wednesday, the first time this has happened since the financial crisis 10 years ago. (1/2)

Keep bonds in retirement funds. Make required distributions of cash (from bonds) and stocks or ETFs and only sell the latter when you need them.
5596 2018-10-26 05:43:38 Tonight's a night of 3s. Got 3rd in both Sm4sh, PM, and we won the ISU Knox crew battle with 3 stocks left. I'm feeling better about my play in some regards but I definitely wanna round out some stuff I messed up.
5597 2018-10-26 05:42:17 Does anyone recall $CSCO miss and kick start a huge sell off right before the 08' GFC? $AMZN $GOOG slowdown projections are reminiscent of this. We are heading into a slowdown across the board in top line. Multiple contractions on topline stocks is violent. Watch out!
5598 2018-10-26 05:41:13 Lost $496 in stocks over the past month so at least I have that going for me

5600 2018-10-26 05:40:34 I'm not a fan of banks for market-beating returns from here, I agree. So 'the market' might struggle. But I think the future is bright for well-chosen stocks
5601 2018-10-26 05:38:18 I think people investing in cannabis stocks, don't really understand the nature of the Canadian market....or just markets #ItsThatTime
5602 2018-10-26 05:37:55 If you look at it objectively, if someone saw a Coke ad on a video about bump stocks, Coke would be the one catching shit regardless of the video content.
5603 2018-10-26 05:37:30 Some certainly will but others don’t.  Overall asx index is still bellow pre gfc level.  Amp, bhp, nab, anz etc 10 years on and no gains.  Only a small proportion of AU stocks have a good fundamentals.
5604 2018-10-26 05:34:47 (Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks extended declines at the end of a torrid week that dragged the region’s equities deeper into a bear market. Treasuries rose and U.S. equity futures fell after disappointing reports from technology bellwethers.
5605 2018-10-26 05:34:43 When there are more stocks sold than bought then the stock market goes down.  When there are more stocks bought than sold then it goes up.  All else is noise.

5607 2018-10-26 05:32:37 also,how meaningful is it to say market is cheap or expensive based on PE of only sensex/nifty....30-50 stocks cant "always" decide the future of the rest 1000 + stocks...its a known fact that sensex/nifty had gone up in recently on account of rising prices of just 5-10 stocks
5608 2018-10-26 05:31:33 Not all stocks go up though. I seem to be on the unlucky side. Not one of my MF US picks are above cost including JD, CELG, SFIX, Entire Rising Stars PF, BABA, IQ and many more. Is it just bad luck? Beginning to think it’s personal.
5609 2018-10-26 05:31:21 Looking at stocks like AVZ, AUZ , BPL, CLQ etc.., how patient the Aussie retail are after a 60 -70 % cut and amidst all the uncertainty , amazing.

5612 2018-10-26 05:29:01 I do believe that there will be a huge unwind as funds lessen exposure.  Everyone and their grandmother is long this... but this is one of those stocks were it will prob be propt up by funds and indexes for years to come
5613 2018-10-26 05:28:58 I have no problem with pumps infact MORE CEO's & directors like @KumovaTolga should utilise #Twitter2Pump & artificially create value for these stocks. It's fantastic for us traders but I'd have a change of strategy if considering the investment route especially in #PennyStocks
5614 2018-10-26 05:28:54 FBX, retail always gets shafted where they are weakest.
You had every one rushing into Bitcoin at USD 20K and now down 60 - 70 % now.  Also I must say, the stoicness of Aussies in general is far superior to Americans who want to run away at hint of a drop in their stocks, lol.

5659 2018-10-26 04:49:12 I have to agree but maybe with different comparisons to different stocks. For example Google closed at $1052 per share today on the lower side Apple ITunes $252.  Tron is going to take over the internet at some point in time. Just my humble opinion.
5660 2018-10-26 04:49:11 Watched one of my stocks drop $10 a share today... hows your day going?

5662 2018-10-26 04:46:09 Good luck, I looked into it a while back and just don't trust it. Maybe finding a few good stocks low or long term investing in stable ones but day trading seems sketchy.

5678 2018-10-26 04:37:39 You’re not old enough to have experienced a world where stocks don’t amazingly recover and resume ever higher. The economy isn’t as strong as it seems if you look deep into data. The glut of liquidity has created a serious mispricing of assets. Good luck
5679 2018-10-26 04:36:44 Which r then the attacking or offensive stocks ?
5680 2018-10-26 04:36:36 Who is better off now?  The 1% only.  Your #GOPTaxScam cut taxes for rich.  Wages are stagnant.  Companies are laying off employees and using their tax breaks to buy back stocks.  The tariffs hurt farmers and we are borrowing money from China to pay farmers not to sell to China
5681 2018-10-26 04:36:11 Would love to trade other asset classes though. And not because of the bear market. It's just better to diversify into other asset classes as well. For last 10 months, stocks were very easy to trade as compared to BTC.

5830 2018-10-26 02:53:55 Study 2007 better, probably new highs by Q1’19 before a bear market begins in H2’19. In fact, when a recession becomes official, the stocks will bottom in early 2020. Equities can correct by 30-40%, but that’s not a depression that you are projecting (not 2008)...

5854 2018-10-26 02:35:53 some stocks, which are all quoting high PE, hitherto, existing holders try to hold that kind of stocks at a certain level, with a hope that the general market will recover sooner but when the market takes its own time, one by one drifting down beyond the existing holders' control
5855 2018-10-26 02:35:46 I remain bullish on stocks and view current volatility and downtrend as a market correction.    It never feels good to see your portfolio lose value, but I believe the bull market will continue. $SPY $NDX

So, they ask, when ALL my targets are ACHIEVED on ALL bearish calls:-
What is left? What is state of market? When to exit/cover/reverse/buy etc?
Well no levels are absolute & certain (1)

5886 2018-10-26 02:19:07 Agreed and same is happening this time. I have Greenply, Camlin fine which are down by more then 50%. But my personal belief is to use such downfall as an opportunity and add quality stocks like Nestle.
5887 2018-10-26 02:18:32 I am NOT holding any stocks as I tweeted multiple times. IMHO, its difficult  to say when we will be bottoming out but I see trading stocks might be  better strategy than holding it bit longer term.

5892 2018-10-26 02:17:15 I don't try to make predictions but my thinking in every stock is this in certain stocks if they don't dilute it to death they usually can only take them so low before there is a trade of some kind, that's what I look for in every trade, if I enter can I profit at some point.
5893 2018-10-26 02:16:47 Haha, dead-cat bounce is when stocks go up after dropping precipitously but are expected to fall again.

    U.S. stocks surged back into positive territory, with the Nasdaq Composite Index registering its biggest increase since March, a day after a broad-based rout sent equities negative for the year.
5899 2018-10-26 02:15:04 Japan’s Topix index climbed, though it’s still on track for a slide of  almost 5 percent this week. South Korean shares slipped and in  Australia, stocks were flat

5904 2018-10-26 02:10:32 My apologies in advance for the duplicate question (I asked the same in a reply to one of your other tweets). I have 70% of my portfolio sitting in tech stocks (FAANG + BABA). Does this constitute a 'sell all tech' moment in your opinion? Or is it too late?
5905 2018-10-26 02:09:58 I was looking at the earnings per share of amazon. Even though they killed it there, they didn’t meet their revenue goal and we all lost money in our stocks :)
5906 2018-10-26 02:09:57 Euro stocks rose on Thursday as Wall Street headed higher and a weaker euro boosted exporters.

5919 2018-10-26 02:03:36 Yeah this seems like the end of the beginning of the sell-off. One question... I have 70% of my portfolio sitting in tech stocks (FAANG + BABA). Does this constitute a 'sell all tech' moment in your opinion?

5942 2018-10-26 01:50:32 Bitcoin has no underlying ROI, bonds have an interest coupon, stocks have earnings & dividends. Like gold, there is nothing to support bitcoin, except the hope that it can be sold for more than you paid for it. Interpretation of intrinsic & extrinsic value is left to you.

5944 2018-10-26 01:48:10 Beg to differ. With interest rates heading up bond prices will go down. Better off having cash in the bank to buys stocks at depressed prices and buying precious metals as a hedge against the falling Australian dollar.

5952 2018-10-26 01:44:25 I don't know why people put so much emphasis on the market cap of cryptos. Unlike when valuating  stocks, crypto MCs aren't measuring any underlying assets or profit expectations. Saying a crypto like #XRP can't reach $X because that would make the market cap too high is silly.
5953 2018-10-26 01:44:00 Thanks Levi! They were tough habits to commit to at first, but after awhile I felt almost no urge to check my stocks, and wasn't bothered by down moves. I just focus on what I own, and the stories of each. I'm working hard to develop a behavioral edge!

5961 2018-10-26 01:39:58 #Stocks,#Indexes ...end signaled. But sufficiently negative news can also end a rally. Long term short positions would encounter no problems here; they would have been held. Going all long on a counter-trend rally . . . well, what if there is no top signal?
5962 2018-10-26 01:39:47 Hardly anyone even invested in stocks in 1976. I think the number is less than 10% of U.S. households.
5963 2018-10-26 01:39:02 I have so many bells and I just wanna spend them all on perfect fruit and pearl oyster shells in people’s market boxes but barely anyone ever stocks them 

Lmk if you do, I’ll buy you out!

5965 2018-10-26 01:35:52 You live in la la land there buying stocks for corporation given money to share holders
5966 2018-10-26 01:35:30 What stocks are you in
5967 2018-10-26 01:34:57 So we should get out of stocks and go for government securities?
5968 2018-10-26 01:34:24 Nice!
5969 2018-10-26 01:31:37 GB Sold some gold on the markets when the Euro € became a convertible currency. We needed stocks of this new currency just like we do any other currency. 
The gold was not flogged off & we still have more than enough. 
The price was low coz the UK wasn’t alone in doing this.

5975 2018-10-26 01:28:23 You know how almost all iOS apps look similar, in terms of button placements and stuff? That’s to keep things cohesive and easily understandable. Android devs try to do the same, but android stocks can vary so much even on the same manufacturer that it’s wildly inconsistent
5976 2018-10-26 01:28:18 cleared out some losers and bought $ISRG today at the 40-week MA. have always wanted to see this name in my top ten and now i can at a $100 discount. every growth name that got away is now available (seemingly) on the cheap. guess we'll see. #stocks

5982 2018-10-26 01:23:31 you have to have that mindset to be a successful trader... stocks are like busses, can always catch another

5990 2018-10-26 01:18:04 Shorting the market is an expression. It doesn't mean that you can profit from borrowing stocks. But if you have proof na may short selling, please provide. It's quite unfair if such mechanism is not available to us.
5991 2018-10-26 01:17:26 Let’s all get together and get good  ideals I want to hear let me know stocks , politics, what ever
5992 2018-10-26 01:17:18 I think (bias) the market has more to go to the downside... so I bought defensive stocks(staples and utilities) and shorted the semiconductors (heavy position for me) through the inverse etf

6001 2018-10-26 01:14:06 I'm glad I didn't buy Snapchat stocks I would had been sick right now
6002 2018-10-26 01:13:53 Yes I am downloading this and this is really helpful to filter out stocks to make better decision.. Great Going Guys
6003 2018-10-26 01:13:32 Trumpies love to talk about how the man-child is making the economy better.
Well, stocks say otherwise...
6004 2018-10-26 01:13:24 It’s quite inconceivable that someone who has enough brains to invest in the stock market is apparently completely clueless about the fact that #45 is a destructive moron whose influence will be bad for stocks

6006 2018-10-26 01:11:56 i'm going back to stocks
6007 2018-10-26 01:11:52 But to the “talking heads” they are both “social media stocks”
6008 2018-10-26 01:11:19 I know, right?  Too many names out there, not enough market share to keep them all afloat.  I think the time for small cap cannabis stocks has passed with the exception of a few outliers or if we get another bull run for all stocks and they follow.  Big names will conquer IMO.

6019 2018-10-26 01:01:50 So I tried being an adult and buying some stocks earlier this year ... I lost more than half of my investments lol
6020 2018-10-26 01:00:56 Several countries came perilously close to it in 2018...notably Germany. South Korea restarted its "closed" nuclear plants to prevent blackouts. Britain also will face blackouts unless Hickley C comes on line in time. All very possible. I will keep buying U stocks while cheap.
6021 2018-10-26 00:59:30 Correct me if I’m wrong, but I thought you were skeptical of traditional economics. So if you are also skeptical of stocks and flows, how do you make predictions about, say the effects of taxes on GHG emissions.

6033 2018-10-26 00:49:09 Looks like Trump’s plan to give to big business to buy back stocks may not have been too smart! Now tariffs are raising cost of goods and higher interest rates, stagnant wages? Consumers will now reduce buying to necessities and this will  cause stocks to drop! So GOP what now?
6034 2018-10-26 00:48:23 Agreed. There’s a handful of accounts that all agree on the same handful of stocks (more or less). Most do not show their faces or their trades. Once you start seeing the similarities it’s impossible to unsee.
6035 2018-10-26 00:48:14 Lost 400 dollars in stocks. Minor set back.
6036 2018-10-26 00:47:58 that was also when we started to bottom in SPY and a ton of other stocks and why we will probably open barely lower tomorrow
6037 2018-10-26 00:46:01 Despite booming corp profits& high consumer confidence, Trump’s trade policy is putting a drag on stocks. Trade wars, talks of withdrawing from institutions such as the WT, blowing up at allies in the Group of 7 &overseeing a revolving door of advisers make markets jittery.

6049 2018-10-26 00:37:14 DX vs EURUSD interest rates control the flow of money, the flw of money controls the markets. Notice where market bottoms are n this chart? I am sure you already know what is each fx basket. EU stocks have been faltering for a bit and you can see why. US has stayed strong
6050 2018-10-26 00:37:11 Sounds like that it reinforces your distinction between shorting outright frauds vs stocks with a wide variance between price & fundamentals that you touched on with Meb

Instead, do what matters: read books and company literature.

6062 2018-10-26 00:29:38 Bank stocks are responding to.the yield curve which continues to fall.
6063 2018-10-26 00:29:01 Vertical view was very intuitive compared to new horizontal one. For instance, if I have to view multiple stocks then have to go back and select new one to see, adding extra effort to scroll through
6064 2018-10-26 00:28:39 $AITB is one of the only stocks that’s NOT falling. (It’s the one I’m trying to buy.)
6065 2018-10-26 00:28:06 But Smash technically is a battle royale game if you activate stocks
6066 2018-10-26 00:27:17 I’ve shorted a few of these over the years. They always hang in until market sentiment drops or the story is dead. These are what I call “ optimistic price to dream stocks”. Paint the dream you need to produce the stock.  Price to dream promoters are though to beat.
6067 2018-10-26 00:27:17 I was actually comparing marijuana stocks to retail like $CTC.A and $DOL which are around the same market caps.  You hit the nail on the head, you need the ever elusive license to grow and they actually don't just hand those out to anyone.  Companies now need serious facilities.

6073 2018-10-26 00:20:34 Wish people would stop comparing marijuana stocks to technology stocks. They don’t compare at all. Marijuana is something that anyone with a license can grow.

6077 2018-10-26 00:18:05 Thinking of changing up in 19 back to an old way. Used to play way more money on only 3or 4 stocks. Gotta be sure of yourself doing that. Lil more risky. But can be easier also. To me anyway. My top 4 now are. Tsco ulta ww gwph.  I’d already be done for the year.

6090 2018-10-26 00:10:02 A well balanced portfolio should include:

1. Diversified Blue Chip Stocks. 

2. Real Estate. 

3. PRO Forex Traders with proven track records!
6091 2018-10-26 00:08:56 Broad-based weakness in the $SPX.

43% of $SPX stocks down >20% from 52-week high
30% of stocks down 10% to 20% from 52-week high

Many of the stocks trading closest to their 52-week highs are REITs and utes. Of all the stocks, Realty Income, $O, trading closest to its high
6092 2018-10-26 00:08:50 Probably less very soon as tech stocks crater
6093 2018-10-26 00:08:39 interested in stocks, cryptocurrency, and trading in general? premium will be getting a discord over the next week or so dedicated to these topics 
6094 2018-10-26 00:08:10 A bear market in stocks would be terrible for crypto. However a strong correction with lots of FUD would be great. 

People becoming worried about traditional assets and looking to diversify into other asset classes would look into crypto. $BTC
6095 2018-10-26 00:06:33 Once owned a couple of these co stocks. They seem to have an extraordinary (for charities for poor) interest in minerals, metals, raw materials.
6096 2018-10-26 00:05:41 I think by buying stocks like aapl ‘they’ prop the market. It is an index in itself!
6097 2018-10-26 00:05:22 I appreciate it buddy. I would buy these stocks at this level. Doesn’t matter if I would though. Market will do what it wants.
6098 2018-10-26 00:05:18 Why are you so obsessed with SM oh man... kid stop acting like you know how business and stocks and investors work eek
6099 2018-10-26 00:04:54 The reason I hate that mentality is cus I was denied so many job ops cus I hadn’t been interested in stocks in uni. So I’m here to prove that it’s never too late!
6100 2018-10-26 00:04:28 It’s never on sale unfortunately and stocks are limited
6101 2018-10-26 00:03:21 I call on the government to re squire all energy stocks
And put together a national plan
With national security
It's too important
6102 2018-10-26 00:01:37 Is this even English???  Bro worry about your shitty 3 stocks picks.... Your all negative on 3/3 now $PKG $FAT $CYBX haha u are brutal
6103 2018-10-26 00:00:56 whats up with them today? I am over these stocks, they need some good proper news, market doesn't care for ktd earnings either. Thoughts?
6104 2018-10-26 00:00:07 Stocks up because we're experiencing effect of quantitative easing.  US budget deficit has doubled.  Keep your eye on bond yields.  A lot of debt coming to auction next year. As yields go up, money will flow out to bonds. Check historical CASE p/e ratios for S&P 500. Danger!
