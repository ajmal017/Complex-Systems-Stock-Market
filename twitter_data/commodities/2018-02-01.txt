10 2018-02-01 22:38:13 Honestly, my neighbour got me into it 3 years ago. He’s in his 60s and was a broker since he was 20, trading nothing but commodities his whole life from corn to gold...
His take on the Uranium story is essentially the same bull story we hear everyday, and he is all in on uranium.
11 2018-02-01 22:35:18 Lots of longer term objectives being achieved in the US (or close to it) while Intl/EM/Commodities spaces are coming out of large bases.
12 2018-02-01 22:30:30 The economic commodities are on the previous time.
13 2018-02-01 22:26:37 Agree. It’s a ludicrous idea. If cryptos are being considered, then commodities are a slam dunk. 
14 2018-02-01 22:22:05 This is why it’s useful to live in a nation with a functioning commodities futures market. You can use futures to lock in the purchase price now for popcorn you intend to consume at a later date.
15 2018-02-01 22:07:08 What's an asset that will literally go the other way from stocks? It used to be bonds but we know that is on pause in this rate spike during the weakest week of the year in $SPX. REITs are falling with bond prices. Not cryptos. Commodities? Other alts?

18 2018-02-01 21:50:50 We import tonnes  of various products from China on a daily basis.  What will a trade deal give us that we don't already have?  What specific commodities would we import more under a trade deal?

40 2018-02-01 21:44:44 I don't assume that all farmers are sadistic people who revel in animal cruelty. My objections to dairy farming are fundamental. I don't think it's right to treat sentient creatures like property/commodities/production units, and then dispose of them when no longer profitable.
41 2018-02-01 21:42:49 Okay but like, if there is a limited number of fertile women, why do they treat them so badly? Like idk but don’t precious commodities usually get like worshipped??? #bears304
42 2018-02-01 21:30:30 Oh we pay taxes alright.. Lots of commodities have taxes here and recently prices have gone up  what do you mean by "support"?

45 2018-02-01 21:06:55 The thought keeps recurring to me that the cost of mining it, like you mine physical commodities keeps being overlooked.  There is still effort involved in creating it.
46 2018-02-01 20:54:37 The sickness in our society is shown by the fact that commodities traders who gamble our collective wealth are rewarded more than cleaners who keep us safe and stop the spread of disease.
47 2018-02-01 20:51:16 I don't know. But I do know that the people buying are most likely the zombies who just blindly buy commodities (mostly oil) when the dollar sees big down moves regardless of the situation of those commodities. I don't know who I hate more. The dirty bulls, or the zombies.
48 2018-02-01 20:38:20 Is the theoretical treatment of human beings and their natural environment as pure commodities in the form of the 'factors of production' 'labor' and 'land', not a value judgement?

51 2018-02-01 20:35:10 Humans have lost a connection to the sanctity of life. We use and abuse animals as disposable money making commodities. They are LIVES. Sentient, born, breathing lives.

52 2018-02-01 20:34:14 Wall Street: "What rumors do we have in line for today? Ok, so we sell the fear speculations on a quarter of a percent interest rate reduction on the gold & oil supply & demand. Ok, let's hit the commodities in today's frenzy. Pull out those scripts & give them to the news girls"
53 2018-02-01 20:34:06 No this is not correct actually. AFAIK  1 Petro is redeemable for a 1 barrel of oil (as long as they stick to that promise). This is perfect use case for block chain technology, it tokenizes oil making it tradable p2p and plugs crypto into the commodities markets via atomic swaps
54 2018-02-01 20:32:41 Not sure that is true.  This winter it seems ag commodities are bringing the highest margin in rail freight.  MRE isn't restricting margin but it appears to be dictating routes that aren't most economical or best for trade.

60 2018-02-01 19:56:13 Let's state the obvious. Very high added value goods will be less affected by Gravity. Mobile phone/ARM chip designs, top end Jet engines, pharmaceuticals. Commodities like grain or oil will be dominated by Gravity. People businesses like finance will be somewhat affected?
61 2018-02-01 19:55:52 Long way from getting organizations to agree to get rid of MRE without some tangible major improvements to counter with. Ag commodities have some of lowest margins to compete for rail movement with. That is what railways want tho.
62 2018-02-01 19:53:58 Amazing Budget. Middle Class People pay Tax on their Salary. Tax on all commodities we buy. Benefits taken by others. Ones earning more than Middle Class who don't pay taxes. As business done in Cash.  Doctors who chrg in Cash.etc.
63 2018-02-01 19:53:19 Im afraid that may only mean stocks will drop faster than commodities (when the bubble pops).

68 2018-02-01 19:39:15 Fair. Another part is far too many see thier fellow humans as either commodities to exploit or nuisances to eliminate.

89 2018-02-01 18:43:10 There is 1 thing - the current lack of support for parents & babies in the US. 2 sides of the same coin. Babies are commodities (can't have one until you have $ & can return to work ASAP, must buy all the products, etc) or the other extreme. Neither allow for help from society
90 2018-02-01 18:39:05 Maybe not productive labor, but at some level there will be necessary social labor. The point, IMO, is to return work to the process of an art form instead of something compelled to the production of commodities.
91 2018-02-01 18:33:49 Ghanaian petty traders have a habit of stocking commodities which consumption is against their morals then judge customers for buying, and then go to church to pray against bad sales. You know you don't need prayer. You need commonsense and lessons in customer service

93 2018-02-01 18:31:58 Yeah that’ll help. Did they say inflation/commodities and sell govt bonds?
94 2018-02-01 18:23:21 That's not the message. The message is don't use animals as commodities not 'make sure you use absolutely all of the animal as a commodity'. Besides which it wouldn't increase the net demand for animal products if all people didn't use the heart so it's a non sequitur.
95 2018-02-01 18:21:10 Plus, Trump's trade policies caused the dollar to fall 11% since he took office which caused commodities to go up, OIL (for him & his buds), steel, wood etc. Low dollar makes imports expensive too. Bad for consumers/real economy. Temporary tax cut won't make a dent.
96 2018-02-01 18:10:18 That’s means inflation for soft commodities. Amirite?

Football is a sport thats transfer system turns humans into commodities. It’s not normal employment.

And now we are debating whether it’s correct to not buy a commodity out of a prejudice or bias?

Don’t think people are thinking logically #whu
101 2018-02-01 17:51:12 Those are useful commodities, (some) VCs have made it feasible for (statistically speaking), young, white, affluent men to start (imho) frivolous companies and gobble smart people to spend years of their lives working on (imho dumb shit) to close without solving a real problem.
102 2018-02-01 17:49:31 Climate change realities we’ve known about for ages. Our WC farmers have been informing us for ages. Apples, Grapes, Canola, Wheat and many other agric commodities. Nobody confused. Basic bulk water provision is DWS responsibility. Simple as that.

104 2018-02-01 17:43:28 Stock trading is like fishing. If the fish aren't biting, try another spot... if nothing is biting, try hunting down a Forex trade, or commodities. Don't sit in one spot too long.
105 2018-02-01 17:42:53 Sitting back watching commodities looking for entry in Metals and Oil, ill be waiting for a decisive move. Too much chop.

I do think oil makes new highs, and I don't see gold below $1300 again, but those are guesses and I've decided not to input trades based on my wild hunches.
106 2018-02-01 17:41:57 You ever look into those $NZD & $MXN suggestions...? Both performing much better than negative $AUD and barely green $CAD... *Same #Commodities catalysts behind them too.
107 2018-02-01 17:40:52 Children who are bought are in the predicaments of childhood. They can not put the actions of the adults in their life in the crosshairs until they mature into adulthood. Saying that gay couples should not buy children is not bigoted. Not everyone sees children as commodities.
108 2018-02-01 17:39:35 Because you are a luxury traveler! Truly though, given that rental cars are commodities, it's a no-brainer to get deals through those sites as opposed to direct bookings. #LuxTravelChat #TravelTips
109 2018-02-01 17:39:14 But as a new GM said. He isn’t here to make the best rotation in AAA or AA or Advanced A ball. This and my original statement are aimed at the people who are acting like this is crazy talk. They are better identified as movable commodities rather than keepable assets.
110 2018-02-01 17:38:57 DXY is getting decimated today. Commodities, such as gold and silver, should be getting bid up here. However, it looks like the USDJPY is getting propped up to keep them pinned down.

127 2018-02-01 16:41:31 Open source, P2P, and email type structures are the future.  People will grow tired of being commodities and see other options.  @Google is one to watch because they adapt to emerging structures rather than demanding corporate control with all its hype.
128 2018-02-01 16:39:46 All #news is "socially constructed."  There is no "news" produced by Mother Nature. 

In capitalism workers, usually inside global corporations manufacture news as 
a commodity for distribution, packaged to maximize consumption, 
bundled w advertisements for other commodities.

134 2018-02-01 16:20:12 Chair Tyson asks why Holland didn’t propose going to zero tax on food? Holland says concern is zero sales tax on food could mean taxes on products that are ingredients, like basic crop commodities of corn, wheat, etc. #ksleg
135 2018-02-01 16:06:45 Per January ISM. "Commodities down in price. None."
136 2018-02-01 16:02:30 If they are solely priced in USD.  If commodities are priced in multiple currencies, that shifts commodities reference point back to gold, which means commodities won't rally much until gold rallies in dollar terms

138 2018-02-01 16:00:25 Such a disgusting bunch of Ministers. Making a fool out of ppl.
Why don’t you increase the tax slabs with increase in price of commodities?
Instead of fooling ppl and criticising the opposition, focus on development and welfare of ppl
139 2018-02-01 15:58:35 Right, which means that we should be gearing up for runaway inflation. If asset prices aren't allowed to correct in nominal terms that means things like commodities are way underpriced.
140 2018-02-01 15:55:24 Nonsense. It’s a wrong statement. Prices are increasing like crazy but still there’s no relaxation in the tax for salaried class.
Petrol price has gone past 77Rs. other commodities also pricey but still you don’t change the tax slabs Coz it doesn’t affect you politicians
141 2018-02-01 15:53:14 this is just another perfect confirmation we are in commodities bull; no matter how you take gold whether hedge against inflation, or money or commodity the "bull is here"; imo
142 2018-02-01 15:49:43 Are we shipping much to Asia with china opening their markets to our beef recently? Demand for those on feed? Do commodities like cattle follow the increase and strength of stock market?

172 2018-02-01 14:47:58 It also serves as an indirect “price support” for all the traffickers who didn’t get caught. They love being able to charge a huge risk premium for moving minimally processed agricultural & chemical commodities that cost pennies per dose to produce. This is truly stupid alchemy.

174 2018-02-01 14:42:01 People should work on their self-esteem a bit instead of relying on a corporation to pity their lacking confidence. 

The engine of capitalism is manipulation — convincing people to buy commodities they don’t need to live or be satisfied. This isn’t a Facebook problem.

178 2018-02-01 14:27:15 So my point is EPF relaxation given to women, standard reduction increased, no changes in previous slabs. 1% cess increased on commodities which are not important.
179 2018-02-01 14:22:51 Little to report this morning. Weather forcast below remains the same. Almost all commodities are steady and dull and already about as low as they can go.  Some product being sold with prides to be established later

186 2018-02-01 14:03:31 No, you're spreading misinformation. It was not a Russian Ship, it was a French ship. That's the problem. The sanctions are against companies, not commodities. The ship was not violating any sanctions; that's why they were allowed to offload the LNG.

198 2018-02-01 12:58:56 At a time like this, the most rational thing that the govt should be focusing on is in increasing the number of taxpayers rather than increasing tax on commodities.. Unga at 130/-

216 2018-02-01 11:45:56 It's not complicity, per se. We have to consider their perspective - when you worry about putting food on the table and mining coal will allow you to, you don't worry about some distant and abstract thing like climate change, or the price of natural gas on the commodities market.
217 2018-02-01 11:44:42 You cannot purchase commodities nor can purchase online goods with cryptocurrency you hold. That's what said in #Budget2018. They have nothing to do with the online trading in the exchanges. #India
218 2018-02-01 11:43:40 A increase in MSP should open up the worry for inflation, add global commodities movement to it and you have a good case to raise rates domestically. Butv these days equity markets are immune to it all, not bond market though

253 2018-02-01 09:13:32 Let's check facts. Inflation is not at all down. In fact many essential commodities have gone through the roof. The real savings that middle class does is the relief from direct taxation. And here they were shown a middle finger.

359 2018-02-01 03:41:51 I remember those days, with NMX CRE AOI ZEN amongst others, they all became 20 baggers +. I agree commodities are coming back led by Gold. Right now my TOP 2 resources plays are $IO.v a junior gold producer and $NTM.c a lithium explorer working a JV with $XMG.c
360 2018-02-01 03:39:15 @eikebatista hoje equivaleriam a cerca de 130 mil pontos. "O bom humor no mercado global favoreceu os emergentes, principalmente os ligados a commodities. Mas o julgamento do Lula serviu como catalisador para o excesso de liquidez global.
361 2018-02-01 03:34:37 Thanks, best to you as well! btw: you made some great resource calls back in 2010 when the commodities bull was running, you might want to dig out your old list and see what still looks good.
362 2018-02-01 03:32:20 You do realize that women have been treated as commodities all through history right?  This wasn't a Hollywood thing. Fathers sold their daughters into marriages for wealth, land and alliances. Maybe crack a book to learn about how women have been exploited long before Hollywood.

365 2018-02-01 03:02:51 The banker who trades in commodities is a murderer.
366 2018-02-01 03:00:17 @Mark_J_Boyle Frankincense and myrrh we're very expensive commodities in Biblical times, so the gifts were symbolic. They were also used for perfumes, not just medicine.
367 2018-02-01 02:50:02 Overpriced assets/commodities/currencies/anything tend to be a pretty bad store of value. 

I think there’s lots of use cases for dApps and blockchain we haven’t thought of. I guess the energy problem will get solved. 

To me, real question is when.
368 2018-02-01 02:48:15 Peta also demands that we stop having beauty queens for agricultural commodities.
369 2018-02-01 02:47:16 Very great #BBAIndia . #Children aren't commodities to be sold for money, property,  vehicles,  luxuries & bad habits

376 2018-02-01 01:52:49 Ainda existem todas,aqui perto de casa tem um CD da Belgo,moro em Contagem.
É uma atividade necessária,porém não é renovável.
MG depende muito deste segmento.
Temos que parar de vender commodities.
377 2018-02-01 01:50:16 I really like the resource sector with the USD rolling over ... It won't be long before we start to see money moving from some of the hot sectors into commodities
378 2018-02-01 01:47:51 What I never see discussed is the rising prices we are seeing in everything that speculators are interested in, such as commodities, healthcare, some real estate markets, on and on, plus the private debt resulting from cutting the deficit. This is *real* destruction.

382 2018-02-01 01:43:22 Commodities should be used instead of welfare debit cards- butter, milk, eggs, cheese, beans, rice, potatoes etc.- which would help our farmers!  Inmates should work to produce their own food - cattle, pigs, vegetables@POTUS

384 2018-02-01 01:42:21 Well I'm stupid, too. Got out of weed last week, redistributing funds into miners, they seem to be performing well. Commodities are moving up on a weak USD and outlook looks strong.
385 2018-02-01 01:35:13 Not just essential commodities. Biggest cause of inflation is increase in transportation costs. IRTDA's carriage by road index has increase crossed a lifetime high of 120 this month due to fuel!
386 2018-02-01 01:14:41 " laboring to produce commodities turns the worker from a human being into a commodity indeed the most wretched of commodities" Marx

 He wasn't wrong 
387 2018-02-01 01:14:25 went OBJ solely bcuz he's proven. i'm a huge believer in Saquon and the rest of this class, but they aren't known commodities yet
388 2018-02-01 01:11:13 Mas q poha de investimento! Só especulação com FOREX, criptoarmadilhas e futuros de commodities. Não tem uma única empresa nessa carteira, só fumaça altamente volátil. Se alguém te "assessorou" nessas escolhas, abre o olho...
389 2018-02-01 01:08:55 los gobiernos latinoamericanos, sin importar el tinte ideológico, han aceptado que la actual dinámica económica basada en la demanda internacional de commodities no puede detenerse. Estamos en el horno
390 2018-02-01 01:02:17 When are players going to learn there's no loyalty literally commodities. Have to educate themselves ensure contracts fit wants not just $$
391 2018-02-01 00:57:15 The FEMA spokesman William Booher told National Public Radio “Provision of those commodities will continue” in regards to food and water being sent to Puerto Rico.
392 2018-02-01 00:47:50 1) do you day/swing trade stocks other than commodities?
2) what is your average annual return % approximately (if you care to say)?

396 2018-02-01 00:28:28 One of few commodities the increase in value after purchase.. I'm down 
397 2018-02-01 00:23:52 The gov stats on Cost of Living are Derived Figures based on Commodities,
Because we are running a "Market Economy" the Commodities index is usually OK,
As in Lip Gloss is affordable because THEY USE IT ALL THE TIME!
398 2018-02-01 00:15:34 FEMA will no longer be shipping new quantities of food/water to the island, but there's lots already there for distribution. Part of the issue is that FEMA almost never does the distribution itself - it makes commodities available to the SLTT authorities
399 2018-02-01 00:09:52 @crypt0snews Please advise to the no-Spanish speakers that Venezuela coin(Petro) is a scam. Cryptos cant be back by gold, oil or any commodities as they have their sales pitch . Crypto are owned by the people and so any project. Miserable economy and a hyper-inflated currency.
400 2018-02-01 00:09:05 Ahhh they pay taxes that HELPS our courageous MEN AND WOMEN in uniform. And that is the facts. Yes go after GANG members NOT the hard working BACKBONE  of our commodities.
401 2018-02-01 00:05:27 And what computer would you use for this ' wind-powered' internet? More volume of each bbl. of oil goes to commodities we use everyday, than for fuel. Plastics, nylon, etc. What Sarah misses is the hypocrisy in saying we need to ban fossil fuel, while using more than avg. person.
402 2018-02-01 00:02:33 To me, there's no big difference trading your products/services via e-commerce platforms (eg. Amazon/Ebay), and trading FX/Commodities via Wall Street platforms. You trade clothes or phones on AliExpress; I trade FX/Crude Oil/Gold via brokers...
