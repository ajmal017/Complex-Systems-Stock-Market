1 2018-03-21 23:57:36 @owenjhill @RepSonnenberg @SenVickiMarble So disappointed in all of you!  You couldn't even move forward to  ban bump stocks? That NRA money must be more important to you that the lives of Colorado residents. #WeWeReplaceYou

7 2018-03-21 23:55:27 Boy oh boy, that Mark Zuckerberg apology was completely hollow and inadequate. Our right to privacy was basically invaded thanks to Facebook all the while helping a sexual predator wannabe Dictator steal an election. Him selling stocks before this scandal is telling as well.
8 2018-03-21 23:55:13 Gun laws should;
1. Ban assault weapons like AR15
2. Ban bump stocks/devices that increase firing speed
3. Ban magazines over 10

41 2018-03-21 23:45:39 I'm not arguing for bump stocks..don't own nor care about them.
42 2018-03-21 23:44:11 Thanks. If viewed only thru the lens of FX mkt, could be right interpretation. However, some of the most sensitive assets to future rate trajectory would be high growth stocks. In DCF where all value comes from terminal value, the risk free rate assumption moves NPV the most...
43 2018-03-21 23:43:43 Go look it up.  It’s proven for stocks. No number ass pulling.  Maybe a little off 5% or so.  But the “lesson” is there. Ya just got be a little better than 50%.  Sizing is key.  Or you can just continue to be a dickhead.  That’s fine. Ha
44 2018-03-21 23:43:11 My first year independent was based on borrowed and "borrowed" chemicals, supported by a dead man's -shoes- main group reagent stocks. Selectively blind colleagues are wonderful people, though it's a shame we need to rely on them so often sometimes.
45 2018-03-21 23:43:02 ? For you. How do you monitor your stocks for movement after hours. News trigger alerts?

48 2018-03-21 23:42:00 Actually, yes it is different. It has a pistol grip, many have collapsible stocks, and interchangeable high capacity magazines.
49 2018-03-21 23:41:58 You see you think by saying gun reform we mean gun confiscation.  To be honest, I’d be fine with people keeping AR-15s as long as we got rid of things like bump stocks and extended magazines, or blind people not owning guns.  Or more restrictive age limits.
50 2018-03-21 23:41:10 It's going up and down  :)  One has to be nimble and I understand, it's not that easy!  It's a period of continuous change and very much about which stocks.  Traders market.

52 2018-03-21 23:39:37 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
53 2018-03-21 23:39:29 This isn't a recommendation, obviously, just a comment on the idiocy of the Twitter CEO.  Not sure I want to buy the stock of a company with this guy in charge.  Disclaimer: I don't own or recommend Twitter. I rarely do any individual stocks.  So I cold really care less.
54 2018-03-21 23:39:24 4 if you count him liquidating his stocks for cold cash.
55 2018-03-21 23:39:11 Dude didn’t blink once. The funny thing is it will blow over and fbook stocks will raise again. So sad. Probably 2x. After a new product launch. I have seen this script b4
56 2018-03-21 23:38:25 It’s been almost a half year since the Las Vegas shooting and we haven’t even had a vote on bump stocks despite Trump saying he would flat out bam them.  Or do you need those for “target practice” and “hunting” too?
57 2018-03-21 23:37:42 SELL SOME STOCKS/shares/equity/bonds?

SURELY...its all about money!?!?...DON'T WORRY THO...they might have to pay a fine, of 0.001% of their gains!!

60 2018-03-21 23:36:51 I thought they banned bump stocks
61 2018-03-21 23:36:40 Sir it is you that are the POTUS! The world knows and the people know but the Dems want the senate and House back just to get rid of you? My advice let it go! Just go quite on them and do your job! Get them where it would hurt their pocket book! See what stocks they own
62 2018-03-21 23:36:02 Sorry to ramble, but my point is, who cares if other people think it was “dovish”. It’s not knowable. Facts are, valuations are very high, liquidity is diminishing as Fed shrinks its balance sheet. Salesmen will say “Fed is dovish” to get suckers to buy stocks. Caveat Emptor!
63 2018-03-21 23:35:39 $aapl 3 failed break outs on chart in last month or so. Terrible posture. Meanwhile energy stocks perking up. $clr $pxd

66 2018-03-21 23:34:59 @meowmerz It was once again about which (select) stocks. Some stocks were not phased whatsoever while others gave away all their gains.
67 2018-03-21 23:34:36 How about the Las Vegas shooter??! Way to little better information. No investigative journalist left?
68 2018-03-21 23:33:59 Stocks tank end of April/beginning of May?
69 2018-03-21 23:33:21 Wouldn't it be more accurate to say that FB stocks tumble as Suckerberg & others sell of massive quantities of their stocks?
70 2018-03-21 23:33:19 Despite fact son is in his 30s, sadly mass shootings were happening then.

71 2018-03-21 23:33:15 In my studies, I have found that, at least for stocks, concentrated momentum portfolios coupled with good risk management tools perform better on both an absolute and risk-adjusted basis. The more positions a portfolio holds, the more it looks like the index!
72 2018-03-21 23:32:18 The real question is whether this is a ship that can be saved at all. Sandwiched between market pressure and debt covenants and the need to close stores (costly) and further investments... You'd want it to gift to your enemy... #ausbiz $MYR #XJO #investing #equities #stocks
73 2018-03-21 23:30:45 “Well, as long as other people think the Fed thinks that they may not raise rates much in the future, I shall keep gambling in overvalued stocks”. This is the type of thinking that is pervasive on Wall St and Main St. Unfortunately, this type of behavior often leads to disaster.
74 2018-03-21 23:30:02 at the volume they were selling to institutional investors, in other words, our retirement and pension accounts are paying for stocks that will soon be worthless
75 2018-03-21 23:29:52 What has he done to hurt you/the people, besides being a "meany pants?"  He's doing just fine, stocks up, jobs up, possibly solving the North Korea issue, something no one had a chance to do. Seriously, he's not even close to being the worst.  Facts don't care about your feelings
76 2018-03-21 23:28:47 You are an environmental vandal and a fool. Increased no take zones would benefit both recreational and commercial fishing in  the long term as well protecting fish stocks and biodiversity. You are doing the wrong thing. #EcoFail #Auspol #fisheries #MarineParks #fishing
77 2018-03-21 23:28:26 Algos were colluding with the Fed to trade higher for a while, but then selloff because of next year's possible forecast 21 months away after everyone bought stocks. I didn't care either way, market is done, controlled. Got enough in today, tomorrow will be dictator difficult.
78 2018-03-21 23:27:29 Wanna bet FB stocks are going to climb to/past 174. by weeks end?

The West is addicted to Social Media. 

There is little incentive for Zuckerberg to 'fix' Facebook other than his Moral strength.

We'll see where that goes in the coming quarters.
79 2018-03-21 23:27:26 The fact that the Walmart agreement is lessening the blow, doesn’t mean they aren’t taking a hit. Lol. Time will tell. Stocks aren’t logical.
80 2018-03-21 23:26:00 There are no military grade weapons accessible for civilians to buy. An AR is not a military grade weapon. Without the bump stock it shoots one bullet per trigger pull and Trump has put in to ban bump stocks.
81 2018-03-21 23:25:15 You can be wrong in stocks about 60% of time and still win big.   SIZING matters.
82 2018-03-21 23:23:31 Mark Zuckerberg either doesn't know, nor care. (Probably both) how powerful his website is and the damage it has done.

He is just trying to protect his stocks and too keep  rolling in.

Even posted statement on his shitty, invasive website
83 2018-03-21 23:23:27 A full repeal of 2A is a great problem. I think it should be more difficult to get certain guns sure, but not impossible. I also agree with the mental fitness. But, there is already many regulations too. Full auto is illegal and bump stocks soon too hopefully.
84 2018-03-21 23:22:35 Really interesting market for consumer/SME financing stocks. Big divergences in business and share price performance. At a glance, appears those leveraging tech ($AFY, $AXL) eating the lunch of those who don't ($TGA, $SIV). That said, same financing risks still apply.
85 2018-03-21 23:21:36 Zuckerberg dumped over  4.1 billion in Facebook stocks over the last year. We cannot trust him whatsoever Grace
86 2018-03-21 23:20:43 For the next four days I'm keeping the caffeine stocks high.
87 2018-03-21 23:19:41 just to point out as he blames .. because no wall ..wont keep fentinol out of the country... with all the lobbys in the white house..im sure his stocks have grown ,...
88 2018-03-21 23:18:55 It’s all about money. Zuc is sad because stocks are falling. If they were rising nothing would be said. For sure!
89 2018-03-21 23:18:27 Hmmm. I just got a brilliant idea. What if I got subs to buy stocks for me?! That would be the ultimate gift.

90 2018-03-21 23:17:41 A few weeks pre public hanging, having them placed in the old medieval stocks in public square so they can be beaten by the public, may serve as a good deterrent to others. Along with paedos, rapists, murderers and hillary Clinton mental disorder supporters. The zombies.

94 2018-03-21 23:16:36 Absolutely! Analysts and Brokers may need to amend their valuations of interest rate sensitive stocks again. Valuations should be a little bit more concrete now as the increments and frequency of the rate increases have been indicated.

TACs are shared between EU countries in the form of national quotas
116 2018-03-21 23:02:48 The fact that Farage dumps a load of haddock - 'vulnerable' according to IUCN - demonstrates the problem. EU fishing quotas exist for sustainability purposes, so to prevent morons in the UK from getting quick, high returns and then decimating fish stocks for eternity

132 2018-03-21 22:55:54 Are you implying I trust trump? I may follow him. I may occasionally even like something that he or one of his followers has said. But I do not trust him. Not since his opinions on bump stocks and age limits came out.
133 2018-03-21 22:55:50 FEB 2000.   Sold all my stocks!  At $137k.  Luck?  Don’t know.  At time held YHOO CSCO RHAT EBAY CHKP. Learned a ton about Protecting.   March 2000. Mkt topped!  Prob lucky.  But no idea.
134 2018-03-21 22:55:47 Does he have stocks in opioid companies?
135 2018-03-21 22:55:19 I’m surprised that not much is being said about how much in stocks that has been sold by Mark Zuckerberg in the last 3 months. Insider trading?
136 2018-03-21 22:54:50 Absolutely! The market was expecting four increases this year. Analysts and brokers will need to amend their valuation of interest rate sensitive stocks again, to reflect the confirmed number of increases.
137 2018-03-21 22:54:29 Didn't he sell stocks before this news hit that caused stocks to fall? Isn't that what Martha Stewart did??
138 2018-03-21 22:54:00 If only @DavidMuir @ABCWorldNews would be journalists instead of propagandists. Real story Zuckerberg sold a lot of his stocks just days before @facebook tanked. #WednesdayWisdom #databreach #DataFest18
139 2018-03-21 22:53:21 The Common Fisheries Policy set up fishing rights based upon what was already extant in 1973-8. The EU has done as much as anyone to ensure the recovery of those depleted fish stocks. But you're not one to let the truth get in the way of a good stunt, are you.
140 2018-03-21 22:52:46 I’d play more with stocks and bonds tho
141 2018-03-21 22:50:31 The US dollar fell and shares initially rallied. However oil prices surged after data showed a large draw down of supplies, and investor enthusiasm crumbled. US stocks finished in the red. @MicMcCarthy_CMC
142 2018-03-21 22:50:26 You seem to think voters want something other than a record-breaking economy, record tax cut, Record low unemployment to include all-time low for minorities, and stocks that have made Americans retirement account make huge gains.
143 2018-03-21 22:50:04 Subway ride to Yankee stadium. Uncle Mike (an investor who never had to work passed age of 51 Bc of trading. He was a chase bank VP in 80’s) taught me how to read the stock mkt WSJ tables.  Applied to stocks and baseball cards immediately. I was 14!
144 2018-03-21 22:49:41 Goods and services? Stocks and bonds?
145 2018-03-21 22:49:21 Legalization isn't happening in July . I can't tell people to buy or sell or pick between stocks . Your dd is what matters and should matter not what someone else says
146 2018-03-21 22:48:27 True, I get that. I think there may just be more outlets than dollar and US stocks. I think the relative cheapness of foreign assets will attract more than we think.  Not to open another can of worms, but I think direct gold and #Bitcoin can fill that gap, minimizing the $ a bit.
147 2018-03-21 22:46:49 All I do is get money and buy clothes and stocks.... you don’t hear about me in no extra shit because I don’t entertain extra shit
148 2018-03-21 22:46:16 No to shoot semi or automatic as in bump stocks. Save your breath talking to me about NRA. Even after my niece was murdered we still keep our guns and hunt but for my family fact remains we would have lost two nieces and others that day as they ran for help if he had automatic
149 2018-03-21 22:45:22 Background checks, ok. Ban assault weapons - No.  you libs have a funny way of broadening that term. Bump stocks, ok. Obama allowed for the sale of them, must have had a buddy that owned a company. Raise the age, go pound salt. If you can serve at 18 you can damn well buy a gun!
150 2018-03-21 22:45:07 @danackerman Thanks for making my small amount of FB stocks make a nose dive. It is not just the big guys you take out, but also the small ones.
151 2018-03-21 22:44:18 He needs to go to jail for selling his FB stocks before they crash..just like Martha Stewart did.
152 2018-03-21 22:44:11 No doubt that'll be some EU red tape to be discarded, along with the ban on trawling the seabed to kill everything forever. Oh wait, that one's WTO, I think. Better quit that too, so we can destroy our fish stocks entirely, again.
153 2018-03-21 22:43:52 Coming to an app near you early next week. Why you should invest like a child. I’ll be diving into my sons’ portfolio of 12 stocks and 1 ETF, which was built with a gift from my father and underpinned by 6 simple rules. It’s up 80% in value since they started 22 months ago.
154 2018-03-21 22:43:33 I missed that train not ready to jump in it.  I’m still hold some bank stocks you recommend early when the market was sinking.  .
155 2018-03-21 22:42:59 It looks like a good time to buy Facebook stocks and close the account 
156 2018-03-21 22:42:55 No, not necessarily.  This is part of reason rates and stocks will rise.  Think about where they go when they don’t want bonds but still need US dollar assets to offset US dollar liabilities.
157 2018-03-21 22:42:32 imo the SEC's actions were more damaging to investors than those scams.  Because if you bought one of those stocks when it was 500% up then yea you could lose like 20% of your money real quick but that was better than the SEC randomly freezing the stock for months then delisting
158 2018-03-21 22:42:20 After a while, I decided to have a look at stocks for trading opportunities today. TBH, they are boring as hell. Once you get involved with #Crypto , there is no going back!This thing has aphrodisiac effect when compared to other investment tools!
#CryptoCurrencies #Bitcoin #Alts
159 2018-03-21 22:42:13 Go with stocks and shares ISAs - a good tax free long-term investment provided you just leave them there for 5 or more years - ideally longer - and don’t dip in. Forget cash ISAs - you’ll struggle to find one which beats inflation currently and so will erode your money.

164 2018-03-21 22:37:53 Not one bit. People have retirement accounts and investments in stocks they thought were safe and he’ll destroy them.
165 2018-03-21 22:36:34 The EU have saved fish stocks by their actions. You only want to use British fishermen for your own ends, and will drop them as soon as they no longer serve your self serving purposes. Lineker is right you're the slimiest tw*t in the country.
166 2018-03-21 22:36:10 Bought 3 stocks of bitcoin today. It’s at 8k let’s hope it goes back up to 15 
167 2018-03-21 22:35:15 I wonder how many people sold their Toys R Us stocks?
168 2018-03-21 22:34:18 Instead of investing in stocks, gold, or cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, have you considered investing in clout?
169 2018-03-21 22:34:08 ANOTHER serious conversation? No we need Congress to sit and seriously vote to declaw the NRA then pull AR15's and bump stocks off the national market.
170 2018-03-21 22:32:50 Nah, stocks represent a company’s financial well-being. It’s more of a commodity, but it’s an empty, value-less one. A fiat commodity.
171 2018-03-21 22:32:10 I love that style, I would like to do, not something like that but something where I use no stocks whatsoever and make it look as good as yours
172 2018-03-21 22:31:47 If an investment 'earthquake' hits like the GFC of 2008... just keep buying... the world does not end and you are picking up good quality stocks at discount prices.
173 2018-03-21 22:31:35 I see no weed stocks from you. Seems like the long hold to have
174 2018-03-21 22:31:24 Zuckerberg gets away with blaming Facebook the company while he gets away with selling stocks before the news hits. Is this an example of sorry, not sorry?
175 2018-03-21 22:30:30 Little bit frightened for tomorrow being that I opened bullish positions and apparently my broker doesn't allow me to sell covered options with borrowed shares. Let's just hope that the 10-year is suppressed and stocks actually pop tomorrow, that would be good.
176 2018-03-21 22:30:15 Si c'est le printemps qui commence aujd faut commencer à faire des stocks de mouchoir avec les allergies au pollen
177 2018-03-21 22:29:48 There is still a need for guidance about the strategic direction for these companies. @Milostadvisors arent obligated to do it but the level of volatility that has rocked the target stocks is crazy....just a lil bit of info would go along way
178 2018-03-21 22:29:14 Stocks rose earlier in the session after U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer told lawmakers that several key U.S. allies and trading partners won’t face steel and aluminum tariffs until negotiations on possible exemptions wrap up next month.  WSJ
179 2018-03-21 22:28:39 Have you looked at the largest short position data on a rolling basis? 
There’s a very strong correlation with volume. With every strong position that’s what comes. The top 25 are mostly pot stocks. Skepticism in the market - not the company.
180 2018-03-21 22:28:04 I need someone to teach me about stocks, I'm tryna be wealthy
181 2018-03-21 22:27:58 RISK OFF: Investors switch out of stocks to cash as global central banks starts delivering hikes after Fed move last night.
182 2018-03-21 22:26:52 Talking about bull cases - how would you describe the bull case for $DVAX? I'm not very focused on biotech stocks but this is a name that intrigues me a lot.
183 2018-03-21 22:26:22 hahahaha, I discuss more stocks in a day, then you can name. Enjoy the free DD, I should charge guys like you. Cross your fingers for some pixy dust, that is what $aaz is after. Maps, historic data, drilling/current mining in the area say there is NOTHING worth discussing#lithium
184 2018-03-21 22:25:20 I think you meant stocks have to stay above a dollar to be listed on NASDAQ plenty fall from grace and end up in the long lost land of the OTC lol
185 2018-03-21 22:24:47 Top Ten Ranking is for #stocks 2009-2018 ... I work just as hard to come up with ... and write reports on ... my #crypto ideas.
186 2018-03-21 22:24:08 It’s too volatile to be currency. It’s like saying that Twitter stocks are going to be the currency of the future.
187 2018-03-21 22:23:57 Don't NASDAQ stocks have to stay above a dollar? For how long can they stay below?
188 2018-03-21 22:23:44 What if we banned the sales of ar-15s and bump stocks and tightened background checks like SENSIBLE same people would do? Hell we already have bills in congress designed to keep dogs from dying on airplanes. WTF?

192 2018-03-21 22:21:33 @policescotland I demand you put his owner into stocks for people to hurl rotten lettuce at. Posthaste.
193 2018-03-21 22:21:25 This is Rubbish. Fish do not recognize political boundaries, most fish stocks swim through the waters of many EU countries. They are not British fush. Before the EU stepped in with quotas all European fishermen were heading for unemployment in the 70s due to overfishing.
194 2018-03-21 22:20:29 Look guys, I don’t know anything about fishing or fish stocks but can’t you see that the man who represents you is a fraud? Whatever case you had or still have it never got heard because your MEP was never there.
195 2018-03-21 22:20:27 It’s not who they THINK it is!
196 2018-03-21 22:19:59 Time to buy Facebook stocks
197 2018-03-21 22:19:51 So what?
198 2018-03-21 22:19:24 It definitely helps me in biotech stocks!  Anything medical related I make better calls on for sure
199 2018-03-21 22:18:11 Maybe we should give her the Benefit of the doubt she thought you were trading stocks.

204 2018-03-21 22:15:42 Fishing was limited because fish stocks were collapsing.
205 2018-03-21 22:14:56 I hope this time SM stocks enough of Super Junior’s repackaged album. Im still pissed that they didn’t make a lot of “Play” albums cause they thought Super Junior wouldn’t sell enough
206 2018-03-21 22:14:09 Have a read of DEFRA brexit papers. Preserving fish stocks is top priority, as is the environment in all agri sectors. Goes way further than currently.  Again, weird EU good, UK bad stuff.
207 2018-03-21 22:13:12 I felt the same about the gun referendum.  Fine,  ban bump stocks.  But the harsher penalties bit is just going to feed the prisons
208 2018-03-21 22:13:03 STRIKER OUTFIT stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
209 2018-03-21 22:12:45 What is the best month for healthcare stocks to increase typically?

@marketcall
210 2018-03-21 22:12:26 They have thorough ideas. Banning civilians from possessing war weapons (like AR-15s) and banning bump stocks are two of their main gun reform ideas. That’s very sensible for me. They aren’t anti-2A. They just want to make it harder to commit mass murder.
211 2018-03-21 22:11:19 I'm glad to see you ignore the realities of fact. Namely that more people are killed by knives, at the hands of others, or with blunt objects than are killed by "assault rifles" and bump stocks combined.
212 2018-03-21 22:10:11 So your position is a ban on the sale of rifles? And also I literally said with the right tools and raw materials it is easy to build with rifles and munitions. And those evil bump stocks can be made with things in the ground so how do you prevent that without overpolicing lives?
213 2018-03-21 22:08:59 CFP is imperfect but it has provided some kind of framework for the preservation of stocks, and we ha e seen some success in that regard which is most welcome.
214 2018-03-21 22:08:32 They are not talking about" taking guns away."You are over generalizing. AR 15 @ bump stocks AK 47s are military combat weapons.They should be banned.  esp underage and mentally ill terriorists domestic abusers.Makes sense yes?Do you want to save a life or a gun.?
215 2018-03-21 22:08:28 La grève de demain ne concerne pas que la SNCF mais de nombreux corps de l'Etat. Toute cette politique de décomposition de la France se paye déjà depuis un moment, et je crois qu'il est temps de faire des stocks de nouilles parce que la majorité en a marre

217 2018-03-21 22:08:15 Market Wrap-up: stocks closed lower in volatile trading as Feds raise rates 1/4point. WELL bounced up from lows as severely over-sold. GDI sold earning 1.3% with SO, DPLO and HUM filling and a remaining open. No pick today.
218 2018-03-21 22:06:35 If there was nothing to be made from it, the EU wouldn’t want it. The fact is they take 60% of our stocks, then sell back to us what we’re short of. If we fish our own stocks & fish will be cheaper and our fishermen will still make a decent living

231 2018-03-21 22:00:55 He was barracaded in a hotel room. 

I don't think bump stocks should be legal. 

More people are killed by handgun each year than with an AR-15... by a wide margin. The mdeia just points out every single AR-15 killing.

234 2018-03-21 21:59:31 Perfect. Just enough time for his cronies to sell “unpleasant” stocks tomorrow.
235 2018-03-21 21:59:16 I  think it was Jim Richards years ago who mentioned that Gold mining stocks would not bottom until Paulson capitulated.     Does anyone remember that?
236 2018-03-21 21:59:15 The need is to find a way to be able to sell shares without Form-4. The shares in the family trust may be borrowable for other margin and maybe he is leveraged with a trader allowed to facilitate lots of trades in other stocks (who knows ... oil which is up?) using massive margin
237 2018-03-21 21:57:42 Well I wasn't bashing you personally, lol.

239 2018-03-21 21:56:30 Hello James, you can transfer the Stocks and Shares ISA in to us but you will require a Sharedealing account with us. It takes 30 calendar days for the whole process. ^KB
240 2018-03-21 21:55:40 Ahh Value! That's extremely important. You make good points, seeing that Facebook has the most users on any social media platform. If you have stocks in Facebook,  we're guessing you'll hold?
241 2018-03-21 21:53:14 It’s called overfishing....and there is a point of no return for these fish stocks if this is political. Ask a commercial fisherman about Atlantic cod.
242 2018-03-21 21:52:56 @NRA please explain how raising the legal age to 21 to buy a gun is against 2A? Its not, they are just trying to keep kids safe. Some 18-21 year old don't need a gun. Bump stocks should be banned. If you can't hit your moving target w/AR15, maybe you don't need a gun.
243 2018-03-21 21:52:47 Just saw @NatashaBertrand on @MSNBC. Excellent again. Have you looked into Chabad financial connections between Jared, Josh, Mark Z, DJT, Putin's Rabbi (Lazar), Roman Abramovich? Or the curious $1B  "exchange" of Facebook, Thrive, Instagram stocks,cash, etc. 
244 2018-03-21 21:52:11 "Qaddafi's government holds 143 tons of gold, and a similar amount in silver. During late March, 2011 these stocks were moved to SABHA; taken from the vaults of the Libyan Central Bank in Tripoli."
245 2018-03-21 21:51:23 If you still believe in technical analysis in any form, for stocks or crypto, with the extensive math and stats data proving it nothing beyond astrology, you’re retarded and deserve to lose your money.

253 2018-03-21 21:45:41 @SteveGrassoCNBC @petenajarian grassy spot on.  All clear for stocks.why are we not speaking of how strong earnings. EARNIGS will be. That’s what matters. Huge upside estimates still not even updated.  2800 we will now test. It’s easy imo
254 2018-03-21 21:45:33 Abused by? How did you try to stop it? How did FOM rules stop you? What about fish stocks? Why didn’t Farage attend CFP meetings where he could have done something positive?
255 2018-03-21 21:45:28 Only the 1st one. “Assault weapon” is anything people who know zero about guns thinks looks scary, you can do the same thing with a shoe string a bump stock does so banning bump stocks is asinine, raising the minimum age violates 18-20 yr olds civil rights.
256 2018-03-21 21:45:15 nevertheless, as shared fish stocks will still exist post brexit, will still have to continue.

Changing to a system that allows everything caught to be landed will lead to boats chasing the most valuable species rather than conserving stocks for future
257 2018-03-21 21:44:47 I don t believe that will happen, even with this scandal of privacy data usage by CA. Too big, globaly used...only stocks maybe will go a bit down
258 2018-03-21 21:44:07 @MONEYEMPIRE question from the newbie if you don't mind, sir. Stocks on the nas need to trade for no less than a dollar, right? If so how long do they have to correct it before delisting?
259 2018-03-21 21:44:06 Since I see it on my timeline again, there's no way these music/album designers have permission for the stocks/images they use on artwork or release in packs.
260 2018-03-21 21:43:40 You really think the social utility of bump stocks is identical to that of transportation trucks?
261 2018-03-21 21:42:43 ban assault rifles, bam bump stocks, install metal detectors in schools. Do something

264 2018-03-21 21:40:00 Gun control has helped in other nations, so why not ours? Even just getting rid of bump stocks is a step in the right direction. If we take it one step at a time, eventually a majority of people will see reason. Of course, there will be people who won’t. But we must try!
265 2018-03-21 21:39:19 What's that adjustment number that also came out? Wasn't it like 3.5mb? Would that add or reduce to stocks?
266 2018-03-21 21:39:03 Well like i don’t even understand how people can say that because a brand stocks smaller sizes that it should be seen as shaming? Like there a petite girls who were smaller sizes and that isn’t a bad thing. It’s such an odd argument
267 2018-03-21 21:38:54 Find it hard to believe the float is as low as people claim. Most stocks that trade the float several times are up several hundred percent. This mist have been shorted to death today.
268 2018-03-21 21:38:41 Not being sarcastic - So you think highly debt levered US stocks will go up in face of increasing borrowing costs?  Doesn't it cross a line at some point?

291 2018-03-21 21:30:29 Not fully unregulated, not the easiest gun to buy, but readily available enough. Bump stocks, high cap mags, no ammo limits, broken/ no background check systems, gun conventions... the system is easy to bypass if one wishes. We don't have much legislation in place.
292 2018-03-21 21:30:24 On a lighter note?
There is some irony that lefties want to ban bump stocks and assault rifles when the odds we will need them are going up. Scary

301 2018-03-21 21:23:21 Yeah just what I thought this so-called Austin Terror bomber is just another leftist & Hillary supporter the same as the guy got started the Los Vegas shooting that led to the banned of bump stocks also people expectorated that this guy was a right-wing supporter that's BS.
302 2018-03-21 21:22:59 And they drove states to change their laws, stores to stop selling to anyone 18 to 20, to stopped selling AR-15 & bump stocks & inspired thousands to march the streets.

308 2018-03-21 21:20:46 How many of the past mass shooters have been <21? Very few.
It's a meaningless push to take rights from legal adults ages 18-20 
Also- bump stocks- No one even uses those but 1 shooter did so you just ban them?
Making ARs illegal just means criminals will have them.
309 2018-03-21 21:20:12 This isn't going to fix the problem. We need strict gun laws across the board now; laws that ban bump stocks, military-style weapons, stricter background checks, longer waiting periods, a gun buyback program, no guns for those w/mental illness, criminal records ...
310 2018-03-21 21:20:07 Can we talk about how the Black community should invest in Disney stocks or how to invest in the Black owned firms that will make money from the next Black Panther and spin offs? Or we are just going to waste time on World Star type bs?

313 2018-03-21 21:17:58 We will include national background checks for voting. Banning bump stocks won’t help. The Vegas killer would have killed more if he had used his semi without it. Raising age limit to 21 to own a gun due to being more responsible but can have an abortion pre teen.

323 2018-03-21 21:12:14 I would educate about guns because most of what is going around about ARs and bump stocks is just plain NOT true.. AR doesn't mean (assault rifle) it is a brand of gun. bump stocks are just shock abosrbing stocks that work like a pump action, and YES

BREAKINGYouTube will ban videos that promote or link to websites selling firearms and accessories, including bump stocks, which allow a semi-automatic rifle to fire faster. Additionally, YouTube said it will prohibit videos with instructions on how to assemble firearms.

326 2018-03-21 21:11:26 @CNBCFastMoney Good for stocks lousy for people.  Separate home loans from the Federal Reserve and Wall Street. All first time home loans will be 3% or under, this by itself will free up more cash than ever seen in our economic history. Do not raise home loan interest rate.
327 2018-03-21 21:09:30 stocks, bonds, and commodities. There are $700+ trillion of assets that are going to have their ownership digitized on the blockchain. Currency use case isn't even interesting to me yet

340 2018-03-21 21:05:06 I didn’t ask to ban guns. I don’t know anyone who wants to ban guns. I want universal (truly) background checks, mandatory wait periods, laws about storing guns when children are in the home, red flag laws, funding for cdc research, ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines.

361 2018-03-21 21:00:14 Saw the interview & don't often agree w/Peters' views, but he did make some good points about the AR-15 rifle & bump stocks. As a 2nd Amendment supporter, I shuddered when I heard that gun fire during the Las Vegas massacre. Was that a sport or hunting application? It was bad.

375 2018-03-21 20:51:01 @ChipSchweiger where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?
376 2018-03-21 20:50:12 WORD! So are Machine guns, ie AR-15s with bump stocks!
377 2018-03-21 20:49:40 There's a new Chair at the top of the Fed, but not a dramatically new message, concludes CIBC. Nice summation. All the rest is white noise zzzzzzzz #ausbiz #XJO #equities #stocks #investing
378 2018-03-21 20:49:13 I’m hoping Parliament rejects the proposed deal and we opt for #WTO selling out our fishing stocks is appalling.
379 2018-03-21 20:48:59 "Dovish” is no longer the absolute virtue it was
during the post-crisis era as stocks are now exhibiting heightened sensitivity to any sign of the Fed
“falling behind the curve”.
380 2018-03-21 20:48:40 One legal note: a specific ban of bump stocks will just lead to some other innovations that converts gas powered weapons to automatic fire. I propose banning any device which has, or can have, the purpose or effect of increasing the rate of fire above X rounds per minute
381 2018-03-21 20:48:14 I'm talking about the lie that was propagated about fish stocks ie that foreign vessels fished our waters out.

384 2018-03-21 20:46:50 I've always struggled with the idea that somehow trading stocks 12 hrs a day or whatever is harder than like cleaning floors for the same amount of time. Esp when you take into account the quality of life you get in return for your "hard work"
385 2018-03-21 20:46:20 Dear fellow citizens, Mr. Zuckerberg needs our help with his grave problem. Let us #DeleteFacebook. dump the stocks and sign the #InternetBillOfRights for (Big) Brother Mark.

392 2018-03-21 20:44:49 Don’t just own stocks own stocks that pay dividends.
393 2018-03-21 20:44:43 This TLT rally is NOT bullish stocks ... This is risk off for institutions. Do not confuse the last 9 years with what is happening now. Fed punch bowl is being taken away... They have no intention of easing till we are waist deep in next recession and it won't be willingly
394 2018-03-21 20:44:28 I feel the urge to unnecessarily remove my toes because the shoe store stocks size 6 shoes.
395 2018-03-21 20:44:16 Everyone agrees Bump Stocks should be banded!
396 2018-03-21 20:42:01 Stocks tumbling so he finally gave a fuck.
397 2018-03-21 20:42:00 Action on gun violence is not a political question — it’s about keeping Americans safe. Here are some things we need to do:

 Make background checks universal

 Ban bump stocks
 Raise the minimum age to purchase rifles

399 2018-03-21 20:40:45 Stocks traded in a nice tight 355 Dow-point range. The market punters were apparently waiting for the FOMC's Delphic pronouncement on rates and then spent most of the afternoon parsing what Mr. Powell had to say - which was: 2 more hikes from here, but maybe more or maybe less.
400 2018-03-21 20:40:31 And foreign countries fish stocks have been allocated to to UK fishermen too
401 2018-03-21 20:40:29 Then why was he selling off stocks last month?
402 2018-03-21 20:38:52 If stores start legally selling ready-made bombs and accessories capable of killing and injuring over 800 people in minutes, we'll all be out there marching. Until then, we'll stick to protesting high capacity magazines and bump stocks (which can do just that), thanks.

410 2018-03-21 20:34:43 George Soros made millions off Mandalay stocks taking a dump. This was a planned attack set in motion by the corrupt sectors of our government 100%.

428 2018-03-21 20:26:33 Sadiq Adatia says @federalreserve rate hike "right on track," confirms "modestly bullish" stance on U.S. stocks, and says emerging market equities likely have more room to grow in 2018.

437 2018-03-21 20:19:50 The problem is not the EU or its policy. Too many fishermen and not enough fish. Without that policy (which UK would need to continue even when they have got back full control), fish stocks would plummet to zero and some species go extinct
438 2018-03-21 20:19:01 Moderates like me are not looking to abolish 2A, but gun transfers and storage needs to be tracked and regulated for the safety of everyone, especially young kids. Bump stocks were Vegas. Even NRA is fine with banning them. AR-15s need reclassification to Class 3 NFA.

467 2018-03-21 20:09:08 It is time that we stand up for a rational gun policy.  We should make bump stocks illegal, make background checks mandatory and eliminate the sale of guns with high capacity magazines. Stand up for gun safety.

491 2018-03-21 20:01:37 corporate earnings will be MUCH higher because 1] they got enormous tax cuts from the tax scam  2] instead of giving everyone bonuses & raises & hiring more people they are using the money to buy back their own stocks so YOU can't make money off it, they will make more!
492 2018-03-21 20:01:21 S&P 500 & DOW close relatively flat, NASDAQ tumbles close to 0.50% while interest rates remain relatively flat after the Fed raises rates 0.25%

525 2018-03-21 19:48:21 You're making the wrong assumption that people are taking money out of the stocks to put into BTC. It's incorrect. Why would any retail investor with a brain invest in a Bear market. Plus, FED just raised interest. That's why investors are getting out of all markets.

543 2018-03-21 19:42:33 Yep. If you put a bump stock on the AR 15 though it will shoot just as fast as the M 16. That’s why bump stocks and AR 15’s are dangerous to Americans.

560 2018-03-21 19:34:31 I deleted my Facebook in 2013 and I've been doing just fine without it. They're counting on people feeling like they can't be without Facebook that's why he is really in no hurry to meet with Congress stocks for a little bit but he's not worried it should be consequences.
561 2018-03-21 19:34:29 These are the two stocks that I have in my portfolio. Was in fusz at .08. I expect a similar rise for omvs once they’re current and true revenues are reflected. The ticker change, new product, and more info will certainly assist as well
562 2018-03-21 19:34:11 You must have had a really poor mix of stocks. Most people I know had retirement accounts that performed really well. People may laugh at you, but they still come to you to defend them and feed them. I guess we should let our steel industry completely die

568 2018-03-21 19:30:29 So. If you’re going to use 1k in any priced stocks , know that you’ll pay or “lose” $20 right away. So then calculate from that how MUCH you SHOULD make to be “okay” with the $20 just for a single trade. Have a risk and reward trade or a nice setup and then use your 1k.
569 2018-03-21 19:30:25 So now what?  Stocks Rally tomorrow as last n meetings?
570 2018-03-21 19:30:22 I just hit an all time low. I just set up excel to automatically update how much my stocks are worth on my portfolio model
571 2018-03-21 19:29:32 In that case you should fight for Gun Control laws. Bump stocks kill babies, assault rifles kill babies. Help us help babies by banning assault gun and bump stocks.
572 2018-03-21 19:28:57 And the EU policy is driven by international  policies; to try to maintain fish stocks at sustainable levels globally.

574 2018-03-21 19:27:32 The hatred nurtured by Russian bots and minons has caused an epidemic of violence in our land. Children are DEAD and yet you still have not banned bump stocks or raised the age to buy a gun. What's the matter? Don't have the smarts to stand up to the NRA?
575 2018-03-21 19:27:08 Un peu des deux, oui.

577 2018-03-21 19:26:57 I wonder if the HODL strategy would work efficiently as much as it once did if CRYPTO becomes really large.

Just like how 'Trading' Gold, Stocks, Forex, Commodities makes more sense now rather than HODLing them.

584 2018-03-21 19:24:48 Feels like stocks with a ton of value in the terminal node such as tech are unlikely to see much multiple expansion from here - perhaps we finally get a shift to value - moving above the natural rate in out years will help that narrative
585 2018-03-21 19:24:14 Is there an investigation into YOUR insider trading? You had meeting then sold stocks, then stock crashed? You made mucho $$$.  You wanna talk about that PLEASE?!
586 2018-03-21 19:23:54 He even acknowledged stocks and commercial real estate are expensive relative to norms. “Moderate vulnerabilities” but, no, he did not go so far as to say we’ll have been in recession by 2020, just that they can’t see three years into future.
587 2018-03-21 19:23:36 I'm a knucklehead most of the time,  but I took them as when the 3 stocks dropped like dominos. 1,2,3....they all fell down. But, that takes me back to the first part of the first sentence...LOL

599 2018-03-21 19:19:37 A large fishing fleet is essential for an island nation utilising it's natural resources. I believe it's worth about £2billion but has potential for a huge increase. Fishing stocks would also recover from over fishing by factory ships
600 2018-03-21 19:19:24 Beads and blankets? Stocks and bonds? Halloween candy?
601 2018-03-21 19:19:21 So why does UK Govt give up 40% of UK's quota for UK waters, Con? The CFP saved fishing stocks from demented fishermen who decimated stocks, then tried to fish Iceland's waters until the embarassing defeat in the Cod Wars. A TINY, dangerous industry that UK Govt screwed, NOT EU

604 2018-03-21 19:18:11 The NRA used to do good work but their leaders were hijacked by extremists who are virtually uncompromising. They can’t even see fit to publicly support a ban on bump stocks.
605 2018-03-21 19:17:57 US Fed announces interest rate increase, stocks go up. Who could have guessed? ;D
606 2018-03-21 19:17:55 And that's that. 45 minute presser from Powell. Stocks back in green. Thought he was fairly forthcoming, as much as you can expect from a Fed chief, and didn't make waves with any major surprises for the market.

624 2018-03-21 19:11:46 About 70 minutes after the #FOMC decision, we're left with quite a weaker dollar, somewhat-weaker stocks, broadly higher bond yields, and USD/JPY about to break below ¥106 handle. Gold soaring, up >$20.

640 2018-03-21 19:05:40 The positive for the market is that the focus on future rate hikes seems more due to a Fed view of a better economy than necessarily inflation prevention. If the economy can grow with moderate inflation, that is certainly the ideal situation for stocks," said Rick Meckler,
641 2018-03-21 19:04:59 Without a doubt I think bump stocks should be heavily regulated

644 2018-03-21 19:04:00 Fed Chair Powell on the stock market:
"In some areas, asset prices are elevated"
He says "equity prices and commercial real estate prices in some markets" are elevated, but "we don't see it in residential housing, which is key" #stocks
645 2018-03-21 19:03:36 As a lawyer, not an economist, Fed Chair Powell comes across as more of a process administrator than a financial maestro. Stocks selling off.

649 2018-03-21 19:03:08 Of course they are...they love a good shooting! Probably trying to get everyone to donate to the NRA so that bump stocks don't get banned. Nothing to see with Russia, of course...sure are a lot of indictments and guilty pleas coming out of that witch hunt.  Funny how that works.

655 2018-03-21 19:01:07 We're only an hour on from the FOMC so I don't want too get carried away, but right now, this is pretty much a "monetary policy 'own goal hat trick'": More hawkish tone/dot plot, stocks flat, 10y UST yields nearing 52-wk highs, & USD down 60bps.

666 2018-03-21 18:57:02 The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage point and signals that it will lift rates two more times this year, the dollar cuts it losses. 10 year rises .04. Stocks remain calm second day in a row.

669 2018-03-21 18:56:06 Nope.  The obvious student loan debt is the big issue.  That’s why when you go back and look at the history of stocks of the bigger companies....most of the owners were quietly cashing out.

675 2018-03-21 18:54:26 Turn those machines off? Stocks now lower for the day. Powell needs to stop talking! Bring back Yellen! #sarcasm #FOMC
676 2018-03-21 18:54:13 Powell: “if the economy (stocks) do well the pace of rate hikes could be less gradual, but if the economy (stocks) slows the pace of rate hikes could be more gradual”

685 2018-03-21 18:52:06 It makes a HUGE difference. As we have seen no laws on high capacity  semi automatic guns as well as bump stocks has led to hundresds of deaths and a school shooting epidemic in this country. wake up!

772 2018-03-21 18:25:23 I get that. I hope he follows through with the executive order for bump stocks. He has some good ideas as well. He just has to get the other morons to go along with it and actually get shit done!

775 2018-03-21 18:24:30 Do you know how long it takes for a bank transfer or credit card transfer? Bitcoin takes 10-20 minutes to settle. It’s inefficiency has more to do with the maturity of the technology. The market is prone to manipulation just like stocks. But bitcoin itself isn’t..

777 2018-03-21 18:24:15 Fed statements are modulations for $USD to stay low, especially when it tries to break above some key levels. Stocks are handled differently. The war uses the dollar as a weapon. One more year at or below these levels and some foreign economies will beg for mercy.

780 2018-03-21 18:22:28 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
781 2018-03-21 18:22:26 The amount of promos a store gets is generally set by the stores WPN level. So that’s a known thing. Also they will still be available on release day (while stocks last)

785 2018-03-21 18:20:50 If you were burned by past investments in stocks, I don't blame you.. Many love playing the Gold, Oil markets. If it makes you satisfied and gives you solid good returns, all for it. Invest in what you know.
786 2018-03-21 18:20:45 I think it is stupid idea to doing TA and any kind price and market prediction. What is the point here? Just imagine Amazon doing TA for Google or Facebook stocks...why would anyone do that?Why is this important to your company and project? which value that brings to the table?
787 2018-03-21 18:20:24 No one’s yet mentioned the decline of fishery stocks. British fishing at its current and past rates is completely unsustainable. Government support needs to be to help seaside communities transition away from economically and ecologically unsustainable markets.

865 2018-03-21 17:59:21 what stocks are you bullish on?
866 2018-03-21 17:58:12 3) bump stocks allow the shooter to literally “bump” the gun repeatedly into the trigger finger. This can be easily achieved without the special stock, just not as comfortably (it slams into the shoulder).

892 2018-03-21 17:48:58 A personal experience doesn't apply to everyone. Yeah the strict states will most likely be blue. My state governor wasted no time in banning bump stocks and raising the gun purchasing age.

896 2018-03-21 17:47:12 When Trump proposed the ban on bump stocks, he literally said that he wanted to restrict items that make a gun function "like a machine gun."

My guess is you're just another ignorant liberal who doesn't understand the difference between an automatic gun & a civilian AK-47.

898 2018-03-21 17:44:55 #Bitcoin critics like Roubini, Krugman, Shiller, Stiglitz fail to notice the inverse relation of #Bitcoin and $USD (and $ denominated assets like stocks/bonds). They keep banging on about Tulips while world’s multi-trillion fund biz rotates into BTC, on continued $ weakness.
899 2018-03-21 17:44:39 What percentage of gun profits do you think bump stocks account for? The NRA opposed bump stock regulation for 6 months after Vegas and only shifted once Trump spoke out against them. I'll be impressed when they propose regulations on AR-15s

902 2018-03-21 17:43:42 Incidentally crypto is also a huge bubble, one that happened really fast and will retrace equally as fast. Stocks bonds / real estate are cyclical. We'll see what happens to crypto future there not as predictable.

905 2018-03-21 17:42:47 Could we bring back stocks for the public square?
906 2018-03-21 17:42:11 The NRA is demonized because they act like demons. Concerned gun owners can start a group that isn’t hell bent on keeping bump stocks legal and telling citizens their time is almost up.
907 2018-03-21 17:42:06 Many also note the valuations of stocks, bonds and real estate. They know there's an everything bubble. So more millennials than other gens have taken some of their small savings and put it in crypto. Yes, this is a function of age, comfort with tech AND the financial backdrop.

909 2018-03-21 17:39:40 Really interesting and slightly disturbing article. My big question is what are the alternatives as we don’t want to overfish wild salmon stocks so does that mean giving up salmon? #salmon #farmedsalmon #sustainable
910 2018-03-21 17:39:05 Senator trying to tell others to stop doing what they believe is right, is a path to failure.  While it's good to focus on building consensus on strongly supported background checks, red flag laws, and bump stocks. You can't build support by suppressing other ideas and solutions.
911 2018-03-21 17:38:56 Not to mention I'd much rather have the EU managing fishing quotas because Tories love a bit of deregulation, and under them we'd probably wreck the fish stocks and breeding grounds irreparably. That's why we signed agreements in the first place.
912 2018-03-21 17:38:36 This is why I believe this efficient market hypothesis doesn’t hold. People can have all the information readily available but their ability to digest it in a logical way is not efficient at all. This is why you can still make more than a 7% return year after year in stocks.

914 2018-03-21 17:37:38 Here's an idea. Instead of throwing dead fish in the Thames (ridiculous and offensive), how about a blanket fishing ban for 12 years to allow all stocks to recover, during which time trawlers can be re-assigned to collect plastic waste. Yes?
915 2018-03-21 17:37:27 I ignored your other points because the idea that banning bump stocks and large capacity magazines (neither of which were used in parkland) would somehow stop mass shootings has been debunked to death.

1096 2018-03-21 16:56:16 Shorting parabolic Pigs a very special niche: requires a specialty broker. I'm usually shorting big cap stocks for which avail not an issue.
1097 2018-03-21 16:55:45 I remember a high standing official  from the Italian fisheries department saying at a conference, catching juveniles was detrimental  to fish stocks & needs to stop - but there again we do love our fried baby fish.
1098 2018-03-21 16:55:43 You snowflakes just can’t handle that the country is better off now then it has been in 8 years!!! More people working less collecting welfare!! Stocks are still up!!! Economy is good jut all haters
1099 2018-03-21 16:54:50 People seem to forget to make that coveted 10x-100x you have to get into the project at a market cap of less than 10M.
These projects with 100m, 1b are the equivalient to a blue chip stocks - they are blue tokens. Why shill them like they will make you rich ?
1100 2018-03-21 16:54:31 Coming to this late: refining capacity use currently 91.7 pct - that's a 20-year high seasonally. #OOTT Big refining runs, big crude draws, still lots of demand; I wonder if we're going to see notable builds in gas/diesel stocks before long that crimp margins in coming mos. #OOTT
1101 2018-03-21 16:54:14 More nonsense than seeing $TCEHY down despite great ER is seeing $BABA $BIDU down in sympathy. #BTD #stocks $KWEB #markets

1104 2018-03-21 16:54:02 Short term impact is there in metal prices globally after Trump import tariff announcement.
China matal prices are cracking and inventory is building up due to fears.
As you said this fear may go off in  few months .
Then metal prices may rebound.
metal price stocks follow suit

1111 2018-03-21 16:52:37 You are implying philanthropic superiority because the Gates focus on health and you back related stocks. While admirable, I am counterpointing that all progress initiatives & technology efforts that elevate society and relieve suffering are good.
1112 2018-03-21 16:52:35 I'd the fur trade a thing again? Do you trade Pokemon cards? Stocks?  Oooooo I know, makeup tips! Let's trade makeup tips!

1114 2018-03-21 16:52:10 Hence the Cod Wars, when North Sea British fishermen decided to try fish in Ielandic waters. It ended in tears for UK. EU controls have brought back stocks. Have our fishermen learnt nothing?

1124 2018-03-21 16:46:22 This is how you lower stocks so rich people can buy them cheaper and then it will go back up. Easy way to make millions.

1202 2018-03-21 16:42:19 You will hear lots of talking heads correlate $SQ stock appreciation with bitcoin. They do not research all stocks like they should. Square's price action is mostly due to its pending bank charter. If approved, this is only the beginning.

1224 2018-03-21 16:34:17 I agree Stephen. I've learned tight and quick loss cutting and sniper like profit taking is the key. Most of my losses have been stocks where I had profit but didn't jump on 'em quick enough and my profit turns into a loss. It's definitely key when trading volatile pennystocks.

1229 2018-03-21 16:32:04 That's right Dan. Huge fleets scavenged every inch of the seabed until stocks were at crisis point. Then an international commission (not the EU) got backing for quotas to rescue an out of control industry. History not your strong point is it?

1328 2018-03-21 16:16:57 It's not just about 'rights', it's also about preferences. If my favourite store no longer stocks a product I want, what am I to do? It's probably uneconomic for them to stock it just for a few - or just for me! - so I must try to source it elsewhere.

1363 2018-03-21 16:06:45 No trades for mew today. Couldn't get shares for $CALI and I couldn't get a good read on the other stocks I was watching.
1364 2018-03-21 16:06:32 Let's start with the basics. Can you tell me which strain of novichok it was, e.g. novichok-5?

If Russia is the only country which produces it, or is able to produce it, or has stocks of it, how was it identified so quickly?
1365 2018-03-21 16:06:14 Of you mean the person who married his own step daughter?
The more now people comes to know about him his stocks will come down.
1366 2018-03-21 16:06:00 My money tied up in other stocks!!! Ugh! 

I'm trying to hit that 5,000,000 share mark for $mspc

1374 2018-03-21 16:04:22 I use Robinhood and don’t own Apple stock. It’s too expensive for millennial getting into trading. You’re right most stocks are low end but that’s part of the excitement, not just the referral
1375 2018-03-21 16:04:14 Yeah you need to eat man you have been looking like a toothpick lately
1376 2018-03-21 16:03:40 Dissecting Zeefreaks' bounce trades of last week's hot stocks and found some interesting common denominator on them. Learning from it. Truly it was a  treasure and he is so generous in showing it.
1377 2018-03-21 16:03:32 FISH ANYONE-UK fishing industry complainTs about EU CFP are based on ignoring two key facts 1) UK local waters were being overfished to an unsustainable level stockS were excessively depleted & the factory ships all contributed to the stress UK fishing industry has experienced.
1378 2018-03-21 16:03:25 Is this statergy works in stocks also??
1379 2018-03-21 16:02:51 Fight for my Grocery $$ Update:

1) Amazon has price matched an item I buy regularly & is never in stock at my Walmart.
2) Walmart now stocks multi-grain Tostitos Scoops - one thing I occasionally went to Publix for (they're awesome).

1380 2018-03-21 16:02:48 NUMBER OF THE DAY   $768 billion
Amazon’s market value, which passed that of Google parent Alphabet on Tuesday for the first time to date. This week’s selloff in large technology stocks has dragged down the broader market, reordering the list of the biggest U.S. companies.
1381 2018-03-21 16:02:47 the interesting thing about stocks & stuff is that you literally get paid for the decisions you make. Yeah, theres consequences for your actions in life be it positive or negative. Really black and white.

1387 2018-03-21 15:59:19 this is a scary post, seeing as how your investor sold 25% of its stocks in you
1388 2018-03-21 15:58:26 But the fish existed - then and they still do now. Stocks have improved for sure and many players have had a say in that (Inc NGO's) but if you want to take the time, you need to understand the role that warming water have played - both in grand Banks cod and n sea.
1389 2018-03-21 15:58:03 So are we talking stocks and bonds or dry good? .......asking for a friend
1390 2018-03-21 15:57:18 @Amazonas_AZFL Any news? 2,000,000 stocks with you here. Waiting...and waiting, and waiting.

1393 2018-03-21 15:55:55 What type of stocks will IP tariffs affect?
1394 2018-03-21 15:55:42 Many years back. They started trading in Non-Shariya stocks via some western Fund Manager.
1395 2018-03-21 15:55:15 I despise what is happening but like many gun owners I was raised by a man who struck fear of guns into me. He was a gunsmith and taught me they sanctity of life. That may be the difference. I will say I hate bump stocks and ignorant gun owners. It stinks when others ruin our rep
1396 2018-03-21 15:55:05 How is Amazon affecting box stores
In the U.S. will retail stores take a big hit
And end up closing
Eventually.  How will this affect stocks
1397 2018-03-21 15:54:34 People have to understand I don’t usually do pre-orders for my shop..i only sell ready stocks because I don’t want to pening2 pikir..i buy stocks, people buy what i have. This one is special case bc it’s exo and coincidentally I’m ordering for my shop’s stocks tomorrow
1398 2018-03-21 15:54:31 Business dami kong goodshit thoughts hahahaha clothing, bar, shawarma, korean buffet lahat na stocks pa!! hahaha
1399 2018-03-21 15:54:27 Oh yeah buddy! Thanks for this one @realsheepwolf . I'm buckled up for flight .
1400 2018-03-21 15:53:04 This is great for our private, for profit, prison system.  We should be looking hard at those stocks, don't you think?
1401 2018-03-21 15:53:00 Frank is correct here...so sorry for the confusion! Corn traditionally moves less than tier one movers like stocks and bonds, so it might be something nice to trade on the number if you don't want bigger swings like you might get in bonds.
1402 2018-03-21 15:52:56 How long is the Glazed Kreme  going to be around? Asking for a friend who may need to get another freezer to make sure they have sufficient stocks. 
1403 2018-03-21 15:52:55 $NBDR ASCM on ask!
1404 2018-03-21 15:52:43 It’s just a rifle sir. There are many more powerful than it. Just like the bump stocks, they throw out the term ar-15 but then when you look at the actual wording of the bill, just about everything under the sun is included.

1406 2018-03-21 15:51:46 i think there is a slight chance for an easing of FED hawkishness, a slightly dovish statement noting the how far we've come on rates would be the best FED move and stocks could resume ATH

i think its only a tiny possibility but its warranted given LIBOR &
1407 2018-03-21 15:51:33 Phase two of tax cuts. Stocks rebounding. School shooting reported in Maryland.
1408 2018-03-21 15:51:21 had no idea the fomc meetnig was today. dont know the result yet, but the way stocks crashed the other day, and cnbc saying bull trap, id guess the result makes stocks and btc keep popping upwards. No idea tho, jsut general thought.
1409 2018-03-21 15:51:05 I hope that little brat Zucker gets jail time. Did you see he sold a lot of his stocks before the bottom fell out. Looks like insider trading to me
1410 2018-03-21 15:50:57 Fishing methods now too efficient! Easy to empty these a of fish. Hence falling numbers. Actually recent quotas have enabled many stocks to recover. But number of fishermen will go on falling
1411 2018-03-21 15:50:38 @TraderEquities @TAKEALL what industries will feel it most? Anyone know any Pharma Stocks that have NOT been negative due to Trump tax??
1412 2018-03-21 15:50:36 Sorry bro stocks are death. Why do 6% a month or year when Crypto those IT a day or week...BUY BITCOIN...
1413 2018-03-21 15:50:03 @PhilDardier where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
1414 2018-03-21 15:49:56 #VAST saves the day when most of the stocks in portfolio were getting hammered.
1415 2018-03-21 15:49:43 We believe this correction in the market provides a good opportunity to investors. Good quality stocks usually make new base patterns after a Downtrend.
1416 2018-03-21 15:49:35 The problem with the congressional leadership is that there does appear to be an institutional bias towards stocks and assets valuations. Senior members may have large stock holdings as baby boomers, or want to be supportive of corporations. So the spending and debt continues.
1417 2018-03-21 15:48:40 I think it’s funny that the west coast fishermen in Scotland blame the east coast fishermen of Scotland for wiping out their stocks not the Spaniards or eu 
And btw ,who decided these mega trawlers could wipe out our national resources for their excessive profits 
1418 2018-03-21 15:48:15 I disagree about tax bill. The the top 1% received most of benefits.   As far as creating jobs most corporations are using the extra money to buy back stocks or are paying higher dividends to their shareholders.
1419 2018-03-21 15:48:00 The anti constitutionalists applaud the destruction of our rights and country. True traitors are in favor of this ( except for the “ bump stocks”).
1420 2018-03-21 15:47:23 Yes! Definitely  Clicks & Dischem stocks them. Also get the Palmer's Coconut Oil Conditioning Shampoo.
1421 2018-03-21 15:47:04 As a fellow Canadian. Your an embarrassment. Why are you even getting involved. Your a fucking Canadian. Still waiting for you to delete all your FB stocks. When u do please sign up with @HillaryClinton and @RepMaxineWaters and all the rad left to that #MARS2018 #MAGA2020
1422 2018-03-21 15:46:20 Stop automatic weapons and bump stocks. And please no guns for teachers. That's stupid and just another way the NRA lobby is helping to sell guns.

1491 2018-03-21 15:41:40 did not create a deterrent for this kid who did not have an AR-15 or dump stocks. All he has was a single handgun. Obviously did not want to kill a whole bunch of people just certain targets.
1492 2018-03-21 15:41:40 He is trying to trap the hogs so he can sell his stocks to them. Beware with $FB. The forward PE is all #nonsenseTalk and hypothetical. Their earnings are definitely going to take a hit, $fb has to pour a ton of money to defend this, and towards making the platform secure. #Sell

1500 2018-03-21 15:39:19 I graduate in 2 months, but I cant do my taxes without turbo tax. I barely know how to trade stocks, and I don’t know when to use a semicolon. I know that everyone in Othello dies though, and Catherine betrayed Heathcliff.
1501 2018-03-21 15:39:15 Earnings have been terrible for 10 yrs. The stock market went up because corporations borrowed to buy back their stock by issuing low interest bonds. This time when the economy crashes, the bond holders will foreclose, sell the assets and stocks will be worthless.
1502 2018-03-21 15:38:49 While alt coins rise, everyone is too distracted to watch the bond market sell off

Bonds Sell Off = Spike in Rates

Spike in Rates = Stocks Fall

Simultaneously, Crypto will drop in order for Wall Street to buy in at cheap prices as their stocks sell off

1510 2018-03-21 15:36:18 Back to basics: Too much analysis causes paralysis! Stocks will go down simply because the move in yields is not arrested.

SPU with 75% invested in stocks, is extremely vulnerable, like reduced 50-70% by 2020.
If you need an expert group to evaluate now, you are too late to the party.

1516 2018-03-21 15:33:34 We nearly killed off all fish.  International  problem.  Quotas were necessary and sensible  for the sustainability of fish stocks,  these people are insane and probably never even eat fish.

1522 2018-03-21 15:31:16 Better to manage main fish stocks in a fishery, rather than a single stock in isolation. The use of upper F ranges needs to be part of an exploitation pattern strategy.

1550 2018-03-21 15:22:14 The vast majority of the British people don’t want ANY  industry hung out to dry. Fishing is difficult as fish don’t stay in one place, and there is a massive multinational effort limiting fishing to increase fish stocks so saving the fishing grounds for the future

1562 2018-03-21 15:17:34 The answer is really to stay in EU and work out a solution between all of us - I can’t see that overfishing and reducing stocks and in doing so also presumably distorting the balance/eco system of the ocean can possibly be a good long term strategy for said fishermen (or anyone)
1563 2018-03-21 15:17:30 All this talk about #FacebookExit and the concerns over privacy really had me thinking this week, so of course after a 14 year self imposed embargo I joined today. I also buy stocks at their highest price just before they tank. You’re welcome Zucky.

1660 2018-03-21 15:10:52 Yes I see that but do fishing quotas really disadvantage us ? Presumably they are rooted in a desire to prevent overfishing and preserve stocks for future ? Would we prefer to just pull everything we can out of the water ?

1782 2018-03-21 14:32:30 I exited it after it hit 67% RSI ~200 CCI- (at $1.51) this stock behaves differently in 65-70% range (daily) as it grinds more than other (more volatile) MJ related stocks therefore traditional overbought ~ 70% indicator is working better on this than others. In my experience...
1783 2018-03-21 14:32:30 Here's some good advice for you. Set aside about $25,000 that you can afford to lose. And go as aggressive as you asbolutely can with penny stocks. CYHHZ or PRPO are good examples. Yesterday PRPO rang in @ $0.48/shr... 1 hour later it was at $1.59. You'd have made about 200%.

1812 2018-03-21 14:21:38 Why do you fail to mention that before the UK joined the EU, fish stocks in UK coastal waters were almost gone and it was EU policy on fishing restrictions that has actually led to an increase in these stocks?

1814 2018-03-21 14:20:53 Fishermen do have a case but they overstate it.  Note that big drop in UK landings post CFP (1983) was in late1990s when stocks declined (but shares remained same). Stocks now recovering. ALSO UK fleet lands 300,000 tones a year abroad - which brings total catch to 700,000 tons
1815 2018-03-21 14:20:52 Except if we don't compromise and work with our neighbours we'll devastate fishing stocks permanently. You're on a populist bandwagon, and you want us to hurt ourselves for a short term gain.

1849 2018-03-21 14:10:06 Personally, I could not care less about bumps stocks. But on the question of banning them, again, we cannot afford to simply give up this ground.

The complaint about bump stocks is the rate of fire they allow someone to attain (though the accuracy is ZERO since one can’t aim)
1850 2018-03-21 14:08:37 would expect YOU to be “careful” with the AGE issue. You already ceded the moral high ground to the gun haters on the age issue. Period. That is a grave error. If we all followed your lead, we would lose that ground and NEVER regain it.

The same may be said of bump stocks.

1914 2018-03-21 13:50:16 But the stocks that you said you trade are performing much better under Trump than during Obama's term. You should have researched your point before attempting to make it. Would suit you well.

1918 2018-03-21 13:49:14 I have been searcing for  the link to a study that suggested the EU saved fishing stocks in the North Sea. Before EU stepped in individual countries fought for ever larger shares of the catch depleting stocks. EU took the politics out of decision making. Will post link if found.
1919 2018-03-21 13:48:58 @LMT978 you’re 100% right, it’s all about your time frame. I’m in the same boat as you, looking for growth companies with at least 20-30% upside, willing to hold for months, even years if the stocks act right #investing #trading #TomsTruths

1922 2018-03-21 13:47:46 You asked what stocks I have owned. Not when. Most of my $ is in mutual funds. Which did absolutely spectacular under obama. It actually will allow me to retire in 5 or 6 years barring a possible mess coming.

1925 2018-03-21 13:46:02 Can not help thinking, with oceans threatened with plastic and fish stocks hard to monitor, with Britain having very few protected areas, EU or no EU, it is one planet, one sea, and we need to work together.

1928 2018-03-21 13:44:24 Fishing stocks need protection. Only international rules can do this. The UK cannot unilaterally control its fishing stocks. The fish don't know where the borders are.

1939 2018-03-21 13:38:28 I asked you when you first started talking about banning bump stocks to give some statistics on how many deaths per year bump stocks were contributing too. I haven't heard any numbers. 

Maybe because there aren't any? Bump stocks are just a talking point to remove gun rights.

1946 2018-03-21 13:36:28 That's not even true. They're for banning bump stocks and most 2a supporters don't like them because they don't do enough. And again the kid used a pistol. Which you have to be 21 to own, so what law would have stopped this?

1967 2018-03-21 13:28:52 Spot on, the problem has never been the CFP, without the CFP there wouldn't be any fish stocks left. The problem is Scottish Fishing Industry is completely expendable to the UK thus the industry has been sold out in negotiations for decades to gain 'more important' concessions.

1983 2018-03-21 13:18:50 Exactly! Path of least resistance. 

If they have legal access to high capacity semi-automatic rifles with bump stocks, they’ll use those and shoot 500 people.

If they don’t, they’ll have to change tactics and switch to a less effective hand gun, knife or bomb.

It’s a portfolio with multiple drivers, not a list of stocks that are all correlated 1:1 (and markets always go up right?!)
Buyers need to know what the manager expects over a reasonable time frame and then buy (or don’t) buy the fund based on that.

2022 2018-03-21 13:00:50 Fishing quotas are in place to preserve fish stocks for future generations. You may be unaware, but fish don't recognize international borders, so international cooperation in setting quotas is essential otherwise no one will have a fishing industry in 20 years time.
2023 2018-03-21 12:59:18 Don't worry fishermen, you'll be sold out quicker than depleting cod stocks
2024 2018-03-21 12:58:31 This stupid #PM is delusional and a liar. She trotts out 'taking back control' every time she's been found out. Even after a Transitional period we won't be 'taking control'. International law requires fish stocks to be preserved and fish don't carry passports.
2025 2018-03-21 12:58:16 Our fishing industry stripped the seas of fish requiring time to replenish stocks, then sold their quotas to the Spanish and then scrapped their ships and laid off fisherman with no redundancy as they were classed as temp staff. Such a beacon of business sustainability

2045 2018-03-21 12:39:42 London stocks had extended losses by midday on Wednesday as the pound gained ground after UK wage growth was shown to have accelerated more than expected at the start of the year, while a slew of updates from retailers meant the high street was very much in focus.
2046 2018-03-21 12:39:36 How will you manage the conservation of fish stocks for the whole of the North Sea fishing grounds or is it your intention that there will be no restrictions so we undo all the work to restore numbers singlehandedly and kill the industry completely?

2063 2018-03-21 12:30:42 The quotas were to control fishing to allow stocks to recuperate ( they have started to)
3. The U.K. govt then allowed large U.K. fishing organisations to buy up quotas from small fishermen ( this putting them out of business), and allowed those quotas to be further passed on. 2/

2077 2018-03-21 12:20:31 Sure. but is that the fault of the EU. Quotas were brought in because the deep trawling fishing practices were decimating fishing stocks - without quotas, one can argue the decline would have been absolute and much faster.

2081 2018-03-21 12:18:30 Greetings! Just to be certain, @djvlad which account is your official stock account - @vlad_stocks or @vladstocks? 
2082 2018-03-21 12:18:07 I think that we need to consider that fish stocks are in serious danger. Unless changes are made, there will be no more fishing industry. If it is going to happen, I would sooner that the industry died while there were still fish in the sea.
2083 2018-03-21 12:17:25 Total nonsense. Cost of fish governed by supply/demand of fish. That’s governed by stocks. Larger more efficient Dutch & Spanish vessels reduce costs to consumer. As usual, Brexiters been had by Farage & co who don’t give a shit a fishing
2084 2018-03-21 12:17:08 It misses the point though: How, as an Island nation with some of the best fishing stocks in the world, have we created a position where fishing is such a measly part of our GDP? It proves the point rather than refuting it.

2086 2018-03-21 12:15:20 Futures were little changed this morning, as investors await the outcome of today's Fed policy meeting.

2121 2018-03-21 11:59:32 It is worth asking why, as an Island nation with one of the largest stocks of fish in our territorial waters of any nation on earth, fishing is not a major UK industry, but men in suits in London gambling money on the markets is. I know which sounds the better nation to me.

2158 2018-03-21 11:42:21 If I was trading stocks (which I am not) I would definitely be very short on Facebook at this moment
2159 2018-03-21 11:41:42 LAW OF ENTROPY

It may not apply to stocks and bonds, but it applies to Commodities.
2160 2018-03-21 11:40:49 Well you seem informed. All I ask is that fishing stocks are sustainable, replenished and not wasted. If that requires less fishermen so be it. (Sorry if that last bit sounds harsh but I think it’s important.)
2161 2018-03-21 11:39:36 The fishing restrictions were brought in by the British government, not the EU. And for good reasons, to keep stocks for future generations
2162 2018-03-21 11:39:13 Cryptocurrencies feel like junior mining stocks where the promise of a big strike is always just round the corner. Don't delay, buy today.
2163 2018-03-21 11:39:12 Must be 800 years since haddock were found in the Thames...good old “Garage” restoring the stocks.
#dickhead
2164 2018-03-21 11:38:36 The quotas are supposed to protect the fish stocks... So I guess you could ramp it up, only for it to crash down in flames when all the fish are gone.
2165 2018-03-21 11:38:16 I like to diversify my trading strategies, not just the assets I hold. 

I hold a large % of portfolio in L-T stocks, some funds etc. 

A smaller % in commodities, currency, stock swing trades etc. 

An even smaller % I use for aggressive trading FX, day trade etc.

2167 2018-03-21 11:36:25 Norway manage their own waters & stocks. If they say no, the EU boats cannot fish Norwegian waters. Just as it should be for U.K. waters.
2168 2018-03-21 11:36:19 @CharlesSchwab We expect the #Fed to hike rates at least three times in 2018, adding to the five policy rate increases since the end of 2015. While rate hikes pose a risk to growth, as long as overall financial conditions continue to remain favorable, stocks may advance. #forex
2169 2018-03-21 11:36:01 Would you consider a fish stock for the group?
Cos I'm fine with making meat/veg stocks but never buy enough shellfish to get a proper fish stock together
2170 2018-03-21 11:35:54 Forget bit coin and all.. Just go long in stocks like PALRED TECHNOLOGIES for safer returns

2174 2018-03-21 11:34:27 No Tom, I mentioned the 12mile zone in regards to it being shared between the small independent fishing boats. Those stocks will not be affected.
Over all the EU fleets catch £400million of U.K. fish compared £100 million that the U.K. fleet catch in other EU waters.
2175 2018-03-21 11:33:59 @wylambrewery read the article in the Morning Advertiser. A thought - if you are interested in exporting to the EU then collaborating with other exporters to hold consignment stocks with us in Holland is worth considering @NewcorpLogistic

2186 2018-03-21 11:27:51 WWF asked many nations (including uk, EU and dozens more) to limit fishing to save stocks. UK options were

• Keep overfishing and destroy industry
• Introduce quotas, shrink the fleet, but save most fishing jobs and let fisheries recover

We chose option 2

2189 2018-03-21 11:26:37 That's why irony meters are the #1 best seller in every, yes every, single outlet that stocks them.
2190 2018-03-21 11:26:06 Bigger issue is fish stocks.

In 90s I was an exec at WWF's web agency, involved in global campaign to prevent overfishing. Parts of UK waters were drag-trawled 6x a year, wiping out everything, even egg hatcheries. Cod were economically extinct (too few to fish) 1/...
2191 2018-03-21 11:25:56 There is more money in housing than in stocks which are in effect taking a gamble where you have to be able to afford to lose if your punt is a dud Real estste more consistent That doesn't mean negative gearing should be retained Neg gearing drives house prices up - abolish it
2192 2018-03-21 11:25:36 I almost never sell my stocks, but I sold my Facebook shares yesterday. I wasn’t concerned about it’s future prospects. It just wasn’t a business I wanted to be associated with any longer.
2193 2018-03-21 11:23:48 Pre-ordered S9+ last March 5, paid in full amount and now your store will tell me that there is no stocks available, that my unit will be released by April 9 instead of March 23. Fake advertisement.

2196 2018-03-21 11:22:24 CFP is about fish stocks, cod has returned to good level due to this, if re smogs barge is full of dead fish it is from bad fishing practices not CFP. Outside EU tarrifs would be imposed on fish exports to EU.
2197 2018-03-21 11:21:20 Because before the eu raped our waters, Fishing was a huge part of coastal communities and the employment rate in these areas have been hit hard by the open water policy. With control of our own fishing and our own stocks the industry both at sea and land will start to boom again
2198 2018-03-21 11:21:17 So it seems rather than transferring just NZ, POTUS obviously knows where the $$$$ trails lead. This effects those who try to cash out their stocks for cash like MZ, BHO, and a few other .

2206 2018-03-21 11:14:42 Thankfully fishing stocks are now recovering thanks to action at an EU wide level, after chronic overfishing of transient fish stocks by many countries, including UK.
2207 2018-03-21 11:13:00 Do you think they're going to reload the stocks ?
2208 2018-03-21 11:12:56 So by financial leverage you think the PIF might try to direct US industry based on large acquisitions in certain stocks?

2216 2018-03-21 11:09:45 Yeah, multiple sources besides Mirzayanov have confirmed that they hid those stocks. In addition, most, if not all of the A-series were phosphates instead of phosphonates, giving a plausible "insecticide" cover. The more innocuous Novichok binaries didn't even need that.

We would have to also discuss proper asset allocation by risk tolerance, age & retire date.

We will not be allowed to overfish our mutual stocks and we should not even be asking to.
2235 2018-03-21 10:54:29 @LBC James. Fishing is a small part of the economy today. It wasn't and it wouldn't be if others didn't fish our stocks. Your asking the wrong question.

2248 2018-03-21 10:49:31 New idea: cap the profit on people’s stocks at 1.5% a year & give the excess profit to people that can’t afford to invest. There’s a shortage of stocks. 

Maybe not, only sounds good when applied to real estate.

2254 2018-03-21 10:46:13 This type of sloganeering is not helpful.  To outlaw bump stocks, and to respond reasonably to 17 children butchered in their classroom by a UNDER 21 rifle murderer is not "gun hater talking points."  That type of rhetoric misdirects debate away from Government corruption.
2255 2018-03-21 10:45:43 Other EU countries catch 10,000 tonnes of fish within the UK 12mile zone. 
We are not talking more fish in this zone being caught post Brexit but a larger percentage being caught by independent UK trawlers. Rules on fish stocks will still be implemented.
2256 2018-03-21 10:43:32 Public service has never been more enriching to more cabinet members and its leader than now. Flights, hotel stays, furnishings, stocks, loans, hotel bookings, club memberships, golf fees, free advertising. Service as its own reward has been supplanted by entitled gratuity.
2257 2018-03-21 10:43:20 "Scott's BS" has for first time ARMED TEACHERS.  This is a HUGE 2a win.

2264 2018-03-21 10:36:06 It is a bit, but they’ve been wrapping it up for a while with small changes to the entertainment around and after Christmas, clearing out merchandise stocks with a sale late last year etc. I don’t really know why they even extended it.

2271 2018-03-21 10:29:57 Of course they do but there will be times when our sea stocks are higher than others and depending on what fish too, our prices will look equally competitive. Especially if we lower taxes on EU exports to counter tariffs. Like i said, market forces.

2274 2018-03-21 10:26:46 The EU sweep up over 60% of our fish stocks, then sell them back to us. Furthermore, there are EU fishing boats now registered in the U.K. taking some of what’s left. All of Germany’s mackerel is from our waters, without our fish, they wouldn’t have any bloody fish.
2275 2018-03-21 10:25:28 It would take another 50yrs for us to rebuild a fleet big enough to overfish our territorial waters. If you think stocks won’t be carefully managed after Brexit, you’re living in a fantasy world. Govts like control. This is another one they’ll rightly have.

2279 2018-03-21 10:23:47 Yes, they have been betrayed. Our weak PM and the Brexit team have made too many concessions to the EU without achieving much at all towards taking back control of our laws, borders and fishing waters. The EU will remain free to plunder our fish stocks & free movement continues.

2296 2018-03-21 10:13:35 Iceland is outside the CFP and has successfully rebuilt their fish stocks despite having a very active fishing industry. Most fishing in UK waters is performed by non-UK EU vessels and restricting their access would allow us to similarly rebuild our fish stocks.

2315 2018-03-21 10:00:52 No, the solution *is* common sense gun control including bans on bump stocks & assault weapons, raising the age of gun purchase to 21, strict background checks including prohibiting gun sales to psychically & mentally disabled individuals.

France & others have significantly more farmland than the UK so why isn't that resource on the EU table for sharing with UK?

2368 2018-03-21 09:31:48 If our fish become too expensive with those tariffs, we’ll essentially have a fish surplus & good stocks in our seas  driving prices down for us.

2389 2018-03-21 09:16:52 If its put writing, then you have done good. If its long futures, its very dicey and you must be really hoping that Mutual funds come and do something for you for nav. 

Problem is markets want more stocks to fall (they are struggling) so sideways, choppy markets.
2390 2018-03-21 09:16:43 midcaps are falling from last three months only. Either U have bought some stocks in December only or your stock selection is bad, I see the only reason for 30% fall.
If u are long term investor and buying stocks from 3-5 years there could not be so much fall. U may b in profit.
2391 2018-03-21 09:15:24 Getting positioned for the next leg lower in stocks.
2392 2018-03-21 09:14:45 The reason I post a lot of long ideas is simple. They held up very well when forced selling hit the social media giants. Add the fact that the market is in a defacto uptrend with higher highs and lows and you have no reason to ignore the long side imo. #stocks #nasdaq #nyse

2401 2018-03-21 09:11:10 We chose to protect our fish stocks by reducing fishing, nothing to do with the EU. Our government awards the quotas, not the EU. It was our government that awarded 23% of our quotas to a single Dutch owned trawler.

2403 2018-03-21 09:07:06 A willing good guy taking down a bad guy. This is what we do if you really care " about the children". But instead you advocate truancy and banning bump stocks.
2404 2018-03-21 09:06:40 Do they print additional notes of $billions that they make as profit ? LIC is a contrarian investor which has very long term outlook on sectors/stocks. That's their style.
2405 2018-03-21 09:05:52 If they stopped trawling which destroys seabed and used less damaging methods. Bycatch reduces seabed flaura and fauna increases health if sea and fish stocks rise.
still be quotas in our outside eu but this is a dead cat dance to distract from the ca and other #brexitfails

2423 2018-03-21 08:57:26 Ooh no response to that one. Also the fact that fishing quotas were requested by the then WWF and we voluntarily signed up to as we were drag dredging the waters and it was preventing new stocks being created. We signed via the EU as it made less red tape. But those are facts.

2524 2018-03-21 07:39:16 Excellent thread. So basically UK was destroying fish stocks and entered an agreement voluntarily not to do so under administration of EU. UK knew the effect on fishing industry.
Now I wonder after #Brexit how the fish will know they are British and stay in UK coastal waters.

2788 2018-03-21 04:20:20 I just suck and need to get better. I wasn't in my head, I just lost. Some of those stocks were not very satisfying to lose but I still lost.
2789 2018-03-21 04:19:36 You could do what the analysts in stocks do and disclose when you own it.  But I think that would just cause it to pump harder.

2896 2018-03-21 03:07:43 LUCK plays a very large role in performance of CEO, Skill is CRITICAL at the lower level. You cant make excuses as an accountant if financial statements contain errors. But CEO can blame weather, industry, building phase, etc. stocks move up/down with no CEO skill contributions

2905 2018-03-21 03:02:31 Honestly, I see Corrin becoming the best character in doubles if Cloud is gone.

Pretty simple to play, big hitboxes, takes stocks early, lives long, easy setups into Dragon Fang Shot/tipper pin from team throws.

Don't have to charge shit.
2906 2018-03-21 03:02:27 Rising interest rates typically hurt stocks and bonds, but not commodities , because they are spot-priced, unlike other assets that are largely valued on future expectations.

2909 2018-03-21 02:59:35 Way to go!  Got to love those roller coaster stocks when you can find them. Did that with $CDTX this year a few times.
2910 2018-03-21 02:59:18 Ok.
What stocks do you recommend?

2911 2018-03-21 02:59:02 Your President just handed himself the biggest Tax Break By cutting programs like Disability and SSI.. But herea the funnier business.. He owns stocks right? How did he Quadruple his investment? And "Truml tower" parties paid by who.? US..
2912 2018-03-21 02:58:58 Rob a bank. Use the money to invest in penny stocks. Use the profits to buy yourself a phone.
2913 2018-03-21 02:58:43 Hi Frank.  Any opinion on $PSEC?  I’ve been noticing I.B. and coiling pattern. Also how can I scan for stocks that have been down 3 days or more without using TC2000?

2915 2018-03-21 02:57:21 Sir. The House of Delegates just passed a ban on bump stocks even though it has zero to do with school violence. Improved safety plans do not stop gun violence or even events like today. This is a gun problem.
2916 2018-03-21 02:57:14 It is a school violence problem because the violence is happening in the schools.  #MDpolitics  In February Hogan gave his opinion on bills banning bump stocks & trigger cranks, "I am absolutely supportive of legislation that would do away with them." Miller is stopping this!
2917 2018-03-21 02:57:12 Japan has thrown just about everything at “deflation,” and got inflation back the zero line.  

BOJ will buy stocks and bonds until both implode - and the BOJ chief will commit seppuku - ritual suicide.  (Just kidding, he’ll cash out on the consulting circuit with Bernank).

2919 2018-03-21 02:54:42 Do you the day we see Trump's penis will be a good day for the market? Feels like stocks for things that can be used to stab out eyes might do well.
2920 2018-03-21 02:54:41 That is the same reason why I wanted 2 stocks at Apex2015. I just felt 5 mins was just a bit too short.
2921 2018-03-21 02:53:25 A few facts: @GovLarryHogan has called for a ban on bump stocks. SB1122 would have allocated $125 million of casino revenue to increasing to the funding for implementation of approved emergency safety plans etc. recommended by MD Center for School Safety" was voted down by dems.
2922 2018-03-21 02:52:39 The smart guys who run funds have to make money. This means they need to be investing in stocks they know are too expensive.  In order to to get rid of them, they must go on TV and tell people how great it will be... so you will buy the stocks from them at the highs...

2926 2018-03-21 02:47:52 Dan Nathan is recommending selling all your stocks .... so .... I think it’s a good idea to start buying stocks like a mad person !
2927 2018-03-21 02:47:27 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your bipolar disorder
2928 2018-03-21 02:47:20 Stocks to Watch: INTC, BSX, AAV. Read our in-depth analysis for more.
2929 2018-03-21 02:46:41 And even so it’s not a positive because a mother and father lost a child we need to fund threat assessment programs and educate people on trauma focused mental health care at an early age in addition to banning assault weapons +bump stocks
2930 2018-03-21 02:46:05 Kill the farmers there will be no farm commodity and no need to impose export import sanctions for price variations. Why didn’t you reduce your salary, why don’t you increase interest on corporate business, why didn’t you control stocks of the business man. Only crush farmers

2938 2018-03-21 02:42:00 He is supporter of free market yes, but in a regulated market by Xi's own rules. The Chinese stocks exchange shows a good example of what "free market" is in China. Yet, it doesn't necessarily mean a bad thing for the cryptos like you mentioned

2942 2018-03-21 02:39:56 I don’t know if Bernie has a mansion or not and don’t really care. What I do care about is his pension for life (not dependent of stock market performance) and “Cadillac” free healthcare. His party hurt both stocks and healthcare but he is immune from the outcomes of both.

2947 2018-03-21 02:38:17 So you advised Clinton not to lower cap gains?  Amazing that your answer is to tax dead people instead of freeing up money.  Your research comes from when people held stocks decades.  It's months now.
2948 2018-03-21 02:37:43 There are only two companies that make bump stocks, if all 50 states take this measure up in each house, the nra and those two companies would have to spend a ton of money and resourses to bribe that many politictions. If all failed, it be nice to put that kinda dent in there wad
2949 2018-03-21 02:37:24 Up here in Canada, the story experts have fed us is that oil stocks are forward looking and so, WTI will go down. Yet most oil timeframes are bullish.
2950 2018-03-21 02:37:22 People who think investing in MF or stocks is playing with money with out knowing basics then they are welcome to invest in PF...
2951 2018-03-21 02:36:32 Italy has a thriving Post Office banking system. The majority of all pensions in the country are paid out and then kept in postal savings accounts, etc. The cost is only €30 a year. One can also buy stocks and bonds through the post office. Great and cheap!
2952 2018-03-21 02:36:29 Half way through the trading day, the #ASX 200 index is up 0.2%. Gains from the banks, mining & energy stocks helping offset losses elsewhere #ausbiz
2953 2018-03-21 02:35:36 In 14 years you made your net worth soar from 2.5 million to 11 million in 2017. Not to shabby, all came from great investing im sure, not from things like cutting corporate taxes to enable buybacks of stocks to benefit the share holders.

2955 2018-03-21 02:34:25 I thought I heard the NRA was against bump stocks...isnt that a regulation that reduces gun profits. Almost as if the argument they fight any proposed law that hurts gun profits isn't really true.
2956 2018-03-21 02:34:23 No... the politicians would lose millions in their oil stocks.
2957 2018-03-21 02:34:04 As of 10:30 a.m., PSEi 8,050.89 down 8.71 points or 0.11 percent.  #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks

DO NOT RELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS
DO NOT BRAG ABOUT YOUR AFFAIR WITH STORMY
DO NOT BAN BUMP STOCKS VIA EXECUTIVE ORDER
2968 2018-03-21 02:27:39 Well Bump Stocks are/were neither legal or illegal as it is a modification. The company willfully try to by-pass a law to make rapid killing machine and should be sued. It's intent to break/bend the law. Manufacturers who promote such mods should be sued as well.

3019 2018-03-21 01:51:32 Raise age, get rid of bump stocks, problem solved, NOT!!!
3020 2018-03-21 01:51:13 I have that clown blocked for a reason lol I dunno what he’s saying but he’s been wrong 90% of the time and continues to think he actually can trade, then bashes people and stocks that have proven him wrong time and time again 
3021 2018-03-21 01:50:52 $CHK $DNR $oil $stocks next quarterly report for a bunch of these is gonna be gnarly if oil continues its uptrend
3022 2018-03-21 01:50:36 The problem is that the NRA will not allow even moderate attempts at gun regulation like expanded background checks or eliminating bump stocks.
3023 2018-03-21 01:48:49 @tribelaw I know a little but not a lot. Ty for all u do. Serious ? Would the fact that #Facebook sold their stocks before #CambridgeAnalytica info came out can be investigated as a “inside trading” issue? As well as the guy who sold large shares of steel industry day b4 tariffs
3024 2018-03-21 01:48:33 That's what got them. They were going to merge with inbev for global distribution. Stocks dropped, Euro was up so inbev just bought them rather than merge. Busch family didn't have controlling interest so bye bye
3025 2018-03-21 01:48:20 Hey, we can reach a peaceful agreement. I’m all for limited magazines and waiting periods, more heavily enforced background checks and the like. As for bump stocks and large magazines, I’d say only let ranges own them where they must be accounted for at the end of each shift
3026 2018-03-21 01:47:43 @ABCNetwork I seem to remember that Rosanna said she would leave the country if Trump became president well he is the president why does she have her own TV show?I guess her stocks are rising one thing for sure she's not a woman of her word? I wish she was
3027 2018-03-21 01:47:28 Don't disagree or agree but in some stocks there is no way I'm moving size through the lit mkt so I'm just in the dark pool.
3028 2018-03-21 01:46:51 If you use this information to short stocks is that considered to be insider trading?
3029 2018-03-21 01:45:18 On ThinkOrSwim you can set up alerts to text you to your phone when price level, or trend lines break, and lots more. Keeping a set of at least 50+ for all different stocks is very helpful when things get wild.
3030 2018-03-21 01:44:55 NO they're DECEIVING AS ARE THE MEDIA DUHHH. Why haven't they openly reported zuck has been selling off stocks for weeks?????? 1000 A WEEK ???
3031 2018-03-21 01:44:06 @ABCPolitics I seem to remember that Rosanna said she would leave the country if Trump won the election now you have her back on  TV I guess she seen her stocks rise since Trump has become the president I guess you're not a woman of your word? ARE YOU???

3033 2018-03-21 01:43:33 Buy back stocks instead of giving bonuses
3034 2018-03-21 01:41:16 & he knowz it! Thats why hes selling off ALL his stocks as we speak. Probably putting it all in off shores too. THIS IS just ANOTHER way to THWART cuz they know the  live & breath on their every word.
3035 2018-03-21 01:40:04 I would bet my right arm that Woods won't b selling any stocks as long as it's making him money.  He needs it too much to impress the 16 yo girls that he hits on.
3036 2018-03-21 01:40:00 You can’t buy an assault rifle at all... you’ve already banned those.  Now you’ve banned bump stocks.  Know the terminology if you’re going to argue about something.  I don’t mean to sound condescending, truly, but it is tiring dealing with the lies and made up points you make.
3037 2018-03-21 01:39:27 Coulda went and bought some shoes..but I bought some stocks.
3038 2018-03-21 01:38:53 Nah, I think he'd lost a lot of money, he equated that with loss of status, & decided he would take others with him. Not uncommon, just the number was great because he had access to military grade weapons & bump stocks.
3039 2018-03-21 01:38:33 FAKE NEWS. Trying to take down a company to hide THEIR BS. YET ANOTHER Distraction while THEY TRY to HIDE & clean up their ACT. Marky boi has been selling off 1000 stocks a week fot weeks!
3040 2018-03-21 01:37:35 Ran has stocks in Cortica probably
3041 2018-03-21 01:37:35 Invest in tissue stocks before this comes out.. Even the trailer moved me.
3042 2018-03-21 01:37:32 I'm probably more meticulous in my analysis when I'm considering a woman I'm interested in than I am when I'm selecting anything else of value: #cars, #stocks, #housing, etc...

3045 2018-03-21 01:35:51 Couple things there.
NO ONE IS IMPLYING THAT!!!!!!
We are 
Pro gun because we dont trust a corrupt government with our protection.
Laws are GOOD I don"t think everyone should have a gun.
There is no such thing as an assault rifle they are just rifles.
and bump stocks suck!
3046 2018-03-21 01:34:58 It would be a concern if they were letting people go but hiring a few employees means they are growing
3047 2018-03-21 01:33:50 If you were to only buy when stocks went down and you have additional money from your income, you will quickly increase your cash percentage.
3048 2018-03-21 01:33:30 Facebook stocks should not be dropping instead they should be rising as it provides assurance to its true power at stimulating the consumer economy #bullish 

Wait until FB issues it's own currency and becomes the central bank of the social internet and firms have to work with it
3049 2018-03-21 01:32:12 About the 4th muster, bighit got all the paymebts but informed that there was shortage on the stocks so they will refund all. Some also bought but they also got noticed that it was sold out already. Kung hndi po kayo maniniwla sa mga updates ko, then wala po akong mggawa
3050 2018-03-21 01:32:03 After Wilson, Mitchell & Williams, I would have a hard time passing on Kia Nurse with the #4 pick, and certainly not for DeShields, Canada or Vadeeva.6 ft, super hustle, great defender & 50% from range, Nurse will be a great pro from Day 1.

3051 2018-03-21 01:30:20 Purchased $GCY today as medium term hold. Gold stocks seem undervalued, especially those with production in the near term.

This purchase partly on that basis, and partly with graph looking positive having broken trend line. Realistically I should have been in few cents earlier.

3054 2018-03-21 01:29:30 With the bump stocks, the AR-15 is just endlessly kicking out hundreds of rounds like no tomorrow, making the Gatling gun look ancient by today's standards when especially factoring in s great deal that the latter was cranked manually by hand. It has come such a long way.

3056 2018-03-21 01:28:50 What's next for stocks?
3057 2018-03-21 01:25:30 Stocks are kind of a weird thing for humanity to rely on, but they're a pretty convenient way to relay how badly a company just messed up. Like ah yes, Facebook fucked up 12% worth
3058 2018-03-21 01:24:34 Wow I wonder what all of my stocks and Bitcoins out in their name.
3059 2018-03-21 01:22:08 @RealDocSoos Good debate W Tucker. I agree bump stocks should be banned. Can't lower age limit, young women are both the fastest growing crime victims and CCP holders in US. Their empowering their own safety with handguns. Not fair to inhibit their right to self defense.
3060 2018-03-21 01:20:57 In close quarters I’ll absolutely disagree, but respect the fact that you at least have studied the subject. Bump stocks have no place in society. They were a gimmick, but turned into something else.
3061 2018-03-21 01:18:50 nothing currently, the meme market is ded and keks who were invested in meme stocks are jumping off of buildings.
3062 2018-03-21 01:16:59 Yep. That + company stocks are imo two of the largest evils in capitalism (there are more ofc but this why I phrased it like that - those are at least top 10 in shitty things about capitalism)
3063 2018-03-21 01:16:35 $SM1 these trending stocks are a bore no doubt. But can't complain with the gains.
3064 2018-03-21 01:16:34 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your cancer
3065 2018-03-21 01:14:52 Actually I was speaking of the adults that have supported bills that offer greater protection to guns than to citizens.

No civilians should have access to AR15s or bump stocks.

Every gun purchase should have a background check.

Domestic abusers should not have access to guns.

3078 2018-03-21 01:04:41 $FDX there is zero reason for this to drop. If people expect more, your not going to find it in many other stocks.
3079 2018-03-21 01:04:11 My mind was blown by a caller on @lbc just now. Fish stocks migrate. So the idea of just fishing our own waters without international cooperation is not so much impractical, but impossible.

3082 2018-03-21 01:03:39 Going into FED - 
Typically we see a pop-drop-pop reaction - meaning you can usually enter lower than before 2p. So why take material option risk into 2p?

See what the market gives you, then react.

3086 2018-03-21 01:01:32 Unless your job description calls for it, no one should have these bump stocks, assault weapons, etc. and these gun owners should store their weapons and ammo securely. Not just school shooters get them, curious and angry kids do too. Not taking guns, being responsible w/ them.

3096 2018-03-21 00:55:28 You're weird. We want to do away with bump stocks and assualt rifles for civilans. Keep your pistols, handguns, lugers. They can only kill a few Innocents at a time.
3097 2018-03-21 00:54:57 I’m a Democrat and my husband and son are hunters. We own guns. No one in this house objects to improving background checks, banning bump stocks, 21 to purchase firearms. If a minor inconvenience would save one  child. .. @hiral4congress #AZ08

3107 2018-03-21 00:52:19 @TuckerCarlson Sir, I watched you criticize on your program that banning bump stocks or raising age limits won’t stop school shootings, so rather than being an @NRA puppet, what common sense proposals do you have to stop the 1,300 children shot each year in the USA? @FoxNews
3108 2018-03-21 00:51:56 Interesting info : S&P has replaced 85% of stocks in S&P index over last 30 yrs ....not exactly 'passive'

3109 2018-03-21 00:50:53 My concern: what if stocks stay at high average CAPE ratios for decades, due to central bank policies, and never become obvious bargains? (This happened over the past two decades, 2009 notwithstanding)
3110 2018-03-21 00:49:28 Thanks for the charts. Question: do you have criteria for deciding when (or at what point, should prices decline) stocks become good values & worth buying again?
3111 2018-03-21 00:47:32 I’m listening to all the BS on how banning  bump stocks will dramatically decrease mass shootings. Cheaper to install a fun switch
3112 2018-03-21 00:47:13 I take it you're in favor of bump stocks, the device used by the gunman in Las Vegas?
3113 2018-03-21 00:46:42 Going to the gym is honestly great, I mean I get to see progress I’m making and I get bonding time with family and friends

3115 2018-03-21 00:45:33 @TuckerCarlson t gd prof is changing t topic & playing down t absolute failure of ppl around Cruz that cld’ve help avoid Parkland shooting. FTR, Jason brought up bump stocks. GreatMill shooting will be another liberal perceived pressure pt for t march.

3119 2018-03-21 00:36:48 Did you see he sold a major part of his stocks right before the news went viral? He saved 70 million dollars by selling early
3120 2018-03-21 00:36:22 Thanks Wilson. Nice list. You’re right in that big money is made in the sitting, not the trading of stocks. Have learned that the hard way and through my ignorance and stubbornness am still learning. Thank again for sharing.
3121 2018-03-21 00:35:33 Yeah, the guy that said "buy stocks!!" just before the '08 crash.
3122 2018-03-21 00:35:10 Yup it's like SM have stocks to replace other's position if someone decide to leave...like U concept which rotational concept so if one leaves it won't bother the unit cuz SM could replace with another new one and another new one and so on...Oh wow...

3133 2018-03-21 00:27:34 Exactly. That's why semi-auto rifles, with extended magazines and collapsable stocks and bump stocks and flash suppressors and pistol grips are more lethal killing weapons.
Weapons of war, not civilized society.

3138 2018-03-21 00:26:42 That's a fact. MK can snipe some earlyyy gimp and upb towards the top blastzone stocks, especially with rage. Kind of want to see more smart MK play in dubs and I think we'll see MKLeo/Javi do MK/Sheik as the standard team w/o Cloud.
3139 2018-03-21 00:25:54 If recoveries were less free than they are in the game currently AND rage was not anywhere as ridiculously broken in how large of a difference it was in killing people I’d agree. Current version of the game skews it too much to one side and given 2 stocks it’s kinda bullshit
3140 2018-03-21 00:25:05 HRC won <500 counties, but those counties are over half the population, 2/3 the GDP and 3/4 the tax base. Since voter participation is low, we are controlled by a zealot minority. So we can’t get even basic steps, like banning bump stocks and red flag laws passed./4

Bump stocks
Flash suppressors
Mags or drums >10 rounds
Pistol grips for rifles or shotguns
Body armor
Certain sights/optics
...all inventions of war. Not hunting. Not target shooting. Not self defense. Yet you want society to believe these are "normal."
3142 2018-03-21 00:24:45 Idol worshipping their AR15s and bump stocks
3143 2018-03-21 00:23:36 Such bullshit. Where in the Constitution does it say you can own an AR-15 and bump stocks? Regardless, why would you object to removing the right to own a gun from kids, the mentally ill, people on terrorism watch lists?
3144 2018-03-21 00:23:09 ...(aside from with bump stocks). It's mostly about finger speed by both handguns and rifles.
3145 2018-03-21 00:21:36 @SpeakerRyan trumps repeated attacks on Mueller is no laughing matter. To date the GOPs reputation is in tatters. American people will not stand for Mueller firing. We are watching. By the way, your selling off of bank stocks smells like insider trading.
3146 2018-03-21 00:21:28 $FYI 20c, the 8c all insto placement worked wonders, sold all placement stocks but still keeping free attaching options. Don’t think all the instos are jumping in for just 150% return, also not enough liquidity for them. Gotta be a lot more in this during the next 6 months
3147 2018-03-21 00:20:29 He's too busy enjoying the money from the stocks he sold off two weeks ago.
3148 2018-03-21 00:20:01 Now i'm sitting here thinking likeeee....the people who's throwing me a bone here and there see it as like investing in stocks because they know I got a good heart and one day its gonna pay off.

3150 2018-03-21 00:18:30 We SAVE money by investing in poor kids bc it lowers crime. Multiple studies find annual returns of 8% and higher. er than stocks.

3156 2018-03-21 00:14:28 i think i have some barbed wire somewhere
3157 2018-03-21 00:14:07 When we ask the question “What was one of your best investments?” the answer invariably leans towards stocks & for obvious reasons. But my $20 pizza stone & $10 pizza peel are right up there with the best of mine. I did get them on Amazon, so there’s that.

3162 2018-03-21 00:11:15 Big into stocks 
3163 2018-03-21 00:11:09 same here, but i do own some personal stocks (and an IRA)...the market just looked REALLY cheap and my co-workers said "DO IT OR YOU'LL BE LIKE US AND REGRET YOU DIDN'T" so i did and it has gone pretty well thus far.

3165 2018-03-21 00:11:05 I really hope we go back to 3 stock 2 stocks sucks so bad but the meta in 4 needs it.
3166 2018-03-21 00:10:34 I’m getting an investment person but he doesn’t do the stocks like that so I’ll have to find someone else if I want to be serious about it- and I do.
3167 2018-03-21 00:09:41 Who knows, Matt. I've given up on the US govt & electorate to the point where I'm straight up buying prison stocks just for dividend. The moral & social fabric of the country is going down the toilet. Might as well make a buck on it, right? That is, after all, the American way 
3168 2018-03-21 00:09:13 How many shares of this do you own???? You worn this stock 24/7 on stockholders and twitter.... relentless.... for real though, do you own any other stocks anymore? I just find it crazy that you talk about no other stocks except for FAT... it's just strange.

3174 2018-03-21 00:02:43 No, but we better protected ourselves with new rules and regulations, which is what banning bump stocks and assault rifles is the equivalent to.  This isn't an argument that you're going to win junior, the facts aren't on your side.
3175 2018-03-21 00:02:41 how about if he had a business about trading stocks?
3176 2018-03-21 00:02:28 Its completely rational, The AR-15 is one of the best platforms for new learners and seasoned shooters to use. Its relatively affordable, simple to use for home defense or sport. Bump stocks are only a fun addition if you just want to play around at a range and dump rounds.
3177 2018-03-21 00:02:26 Assault weapons -- as you know, I know very little about guns other than 1) handled a shot gun and bullets once to keep a person from hurting self, 2) an old boyfriend-- a cop-- taught me how to use a handgun and how to line up the sites. Assault - semi auto rifles, bump stocks?
