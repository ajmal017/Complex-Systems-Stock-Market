14 2018-12-19 22:46:48 You may recall that by 2008 oil and gold prices were skyrocketing. The Fed saw the inflation starting in 2005 or 2006, and they began to raise rates. Eventually after a number of rate hikes they popped the bubbles in housing and commodities, but things popped hard.

36 2018-12-19 22:37:08 There’s nothing wrong with trading for proven commodities in football! I just wouldn’t trade my brand new shiny Ferrari for one with minor front end damage and the other that comes with a salvage title! Btw when did Luck or Wentz win an MVP? How much did you drink today?
37 2018-12-19 22:28:48 The #FOMC decision is in. Now what? Bob Michele, AM CIO and Head of Global Fixed Income, Currency & Commodities, is on @SquawkCNBC at 8:10am ET discussing the #FederalReserve decision, emerging markets, and global growth concerns.
38 2018-12-19 22:28:26 Aportan el 10% de los ingresos tributarios del fisco. Te parece poco? En el 2007 llegaron a representar 50%. Toma en cuenta que lo que venden son commodities.
39 2018-12-19 22:26:57 We‘ll see about it after S&P crashes. Powell will be lowering in panic and pushing QEs thereafter. In fact, pausing after a decline and then raising more while the equities including commodities and rates are still accelerating down is not even policymaking, but being an asshole!
40 2018-12-19 22:23:36 That’s what you get when you have an extreme wealth gap as we do in the USA currently with the wealth gap index at 85% and still going up. Land is a finite market and therefore far less elastic then different commodities that can be produced.
41 2018-12-19 22:10:44 A little surprised 10yr & 30yr didn't rally more given Fed predicted slowdown in both growth & inflation as well as commodities index at life-time low.

I think curve inverts more b/c of long bond rallying rather than short bond selling off.
42 2018-12-19 22:09:38 Give up on commodities, this will be a different recession.
43 2018-12-19 22:03:47 #TheLongSong am surprised so many are surprised how Goodwin switched. That's just the way it was during slavery.  The Master's priority was ensuring plantations made a profit to send back to England. Women black and white we're just commodities..

47 2018-12-19 21:46:20 I think Alberta alienation is as old as Alberta.  I remember my father & his brothers in the 1950s ranting about inequities with the east.  Complaining about commodities arriving on westcoast shipped to Ontario & back to Alberta with westerners paying shipping costs
48 2018-12-19 21:45:19 El precio de los commodities duró hasta el 2008, sin embargo el salario real siguió creciendo.
También mejoró la distribución de la riqueza.
Hubo un auge de la economía a principios de los 90 y ello nunca se reflejó en el salario, tampoco en la distribución.

50 2018-12-19 21:33:14 What's concerning is when stock, credit and commodities markets are all selling off at once b/c it suggests real money is pulling out of the ALL markets.  Typically a rotation into gov.t bonds accompanies a sell-off  in stocks b/c govt bonds are a guaranteed return vs equities.
51 2018-12-19 21:26:09 EME troubles are going stronger. Dollar shortage and draining liquidity. Financial assets and commodities down.
52 2018-12-19 21:20:59 Hace tres meses saltaban de la dicha porque estaba a us$ 80 el barril, ahora está en el nivel de hace seis meses. Basar la economía del país en el precio internacional de commodities lo hacen las banana republics. Urge invertir en c&t, industria, productos de valor agregado
53 2018-12-19 21:15:21 Federal Reserve Jay Powell thinks he knows more than markets.  Commodities, bond yields, global economies, and companies like Federal Express are telling you global growth is slowing and yet you ignore due to your arrogance.  And you have 60 PhD economist on staff?  Markets tank
54 2018-12-19 21:12:23 Hard to believe what I just heard Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell.  Your academic team thinks you know more than markets?  Deeply troubling!  What are commodities, bond yields, European economies, and Fed Express telling you?  Global growth is slowing. Yet you raise rates
55 2018-12-19 21:11:01 you call yourself anticapitalist yet i see you require basic commodities to survive....interesting...
56 2018-12-19 21:07:47 Actually only a tiny % of humans lay waste to most resources to extract the maximum profit for themselves alone, regardless of the effects on all other life. But we all have to put an end to this privately owned system where 'value' is reduced to the sale of commodities.
57 2018-12-19 21:06:02 @IziCoin IZC has a bearing on the real estate market and on commodities deserves to be highlighted. Also you can use a iZiCoin just to invest, buy things with a discount or convert your IZC (min 10.000) in a real share of our holding.
58 2018-12-19 20:59:15 Foi bem gerido. Se fosse, por exemplo, o Bolsonaro, não iria "surfar" no crescimento da China e fortalecimento da exportação de commodities. Se fosse ele, iria tentar vender pra Israel. São decisões (no caso do governo Lula) pragmáticas.
59 2018-12-19 20:52:50 The market has been on a tear w/ de-regulation, corp tax cuts spent exclusively on stock buybacks (to trigger skyrocketing exec comp as option grants are triggered - NOT 'shareholder value' btw) and ..yes, rising interest rates.  Credit markets are flashing red, commodities too.
60 2018-12-19 20:47:46 "The effect of the late-2017 corporate tax cuts are wearing off, and signs of an economic slowdown are starting to become apparent in the housing market, corporate outlooks and commodities markets"

62 2018-12-19 20:41:03 Lo último razonable en economía que tuvimos, fue en 2005, en 2006 ya empezó la joda de empezar a perder competitividad y superavit con la salida de Lavagna y si bien 2007 estaba saneado, fue por el colchón devaluatorio de 2002 y el alto ingreso por commodities altas también
63 2018-12-19 20:29:13 Yes could well be entering one. Commodities are heading down. High Streets are not busy. Glad to receive our smoked fish as always though.
64 2018-12-19 20:20:27 And capital cost increase and commodities stay relatively flat. So I'll answer your question with a question. How do you foresee farmers paying for them?
65 2018-12-19 20:16:55 No more taxes on income and commodities. Other goods can be taxed federally.
66 2018-12-19 20:12:45 I agree, men who are nice are probably raised by women who teach them to value women and not treat them like commodities.
67 2018-12-19 20:10:09 e commodities desabando.... vamos ver!
68 2018-12-19 20:09:30 Sabe o que esses "dados macroeconômicos" dizem mas vcs preferem ignorar? Que o crescimento econômico é resultado de um processo e de causas que independem de gestão, como a estabilidade econômica, o crescimento aceleradíssimo da China e o bom desempenho das commodities.

70 2018-12-19 20:04:05 As an investor, I feel the only time to trade commodities is when they are fully or overvalued. Hence why I dropped my portfolio in late January ( $FB $AMZN $GOOG $NVDA $NFLX $AAPL etc). I kept a large stake in $TWTR $TSLA $CGC bc they haven’t met my “fully valued” criteria.
71 2018-12-19 19:59:21 Especially when these trades have been incredibly upsetting to the fans. It makes me question whether this organization actually cares about the players as people or just just sees them as commodities, which is how it seems.
72 2018-12-19 19:52:27 No offence, but we don't need to get more "involved" with or pay more expenses that are endorsed by our peers. Until we can charge extra for our commodities on our end... no thanks. We bleed enough for everyone else.
73 2018-12-19 19:51:22 it's not just oil.  When broad range of commodities all go in the same direction, people have historically associated this with change in economic direction. Unlike stocks and bonds, physical commodities are consumed. When prices are falling, demands/growth must be falling.

81 2018-12-19 19:30:22 Yeah, and probably to help with trade settlement. A lot of our commodities are bought in USD, and that's going to need a little relief, at the expense of the money supply's growth.
82 2018-12-19 19:27:44 Well said! I want to live in a country where everyone is valued, people are not commodities with a monetary value. I honestly don't recognize or relate in any way to what I have been hearing recently.
83 2018-12-19 19:25:34 The good news is the economy is still strong and the Fed will soon learn that the economy is slowing faster than they realize. Look at commodities and real estate. When RE is going down, same with economic growth.
84 2018-12-19 19:21:58 You are the smartest bird out there but wasn't market anticipating 3 hikes instead of 2 and also fed had some dovish view of 2019. Won't it be negative for dollar? My hope is that my commodities option will play out fine
85 2018-12-19 19:13:10 T-bills would be my #1 choice if you think the house is coming down.

I don't believe we've had an instance where the FDIC failed to cover insured deposits, but that's still behind t-bills in terms of safety.

Commodities are volatile. Gold might win but you're making a bet.

89 2018-12-19 19:08:55 With this hike and signals of future hikes, US$ set up to tracking higher=lower exports=lower profits=lower stock prices. Also commodities set up to track lower. Might have to revisit my oil exposure.

91 2018-12-19 19:04:50 Wrong! Index funds work through custodians such as Edward Jones. As of 2007 they can trade commodities...that is why crude oil went to $140 a barrel. They will buy CME Bitcoin futures and or Nasdaq Bitcoin futures...and possibly Bakkt futures...they don't need a ETF!!!
92 2018-12-19 18:54:58 Most effective way to 'help' developing countries is to seal bilateral free trade deals with them.

◙ Boost ports and airports
◙ Help them manufacture, not just export commodities & raw materials
◙ Spur local entrepreneurialism
◙ Cut corruption by generating legitimate profit
93 2018-12-19 18:53:17 Right... there's a GREAT chance of the Tories paying attention to the NFU when the escalating prices of basic commodities start affecting their chance of re-election. The UK isn't a farmers charity.
94 2018-12-19 18:52:29 Driving commodities down ONLY in the most financialized currency or...?
95 2018-12-19 18:52:17 Most of it sheer luck due to commodities spl crude. On bond side as well, G-Sec is down 100bips while US 10y is also down 50bips from peak. They are taking of lower growth & inflation.

97 2018-12-19 18:47:21 1/ Yes.  China in particular is "sterilizing" US deficits by buying up finite supplies of real commodities all over the earth (& then converting them into CNY over time), & by lending USDs to EM's (in return for commodities, or port access, or political favors, etc.)
98 2018-12-19 18:45:20 perso je n'ai jamais trader les cryptomonnaies c'est du vent je préféré le pétrole ou ce qu'on appelle les "commodities"..les matieres premières il y a beaucoup moins de risques. regarde le USOIL on est descendu comme des barges #trump mais on va remonter jusqu'au 70$ ds 2mois
99 2018-12-19 18:44:11 Thank you! So in any sort of crash scenario prices of most commodities have tons of pressure to depreciate because people get stopped out across the board and are forced to "buy" USD since the derivatives are valued in it? which is a huge market so buyers cannot compensate?
100 2018-12-19 18:42:44 Märk väl att alla handlar olika tidshorisont, min syn på börs, dollar, guld och commodities är ganska varierande beroende på vilken tidsaspekt jag swingar. DYOR och allt det där, och självklart är ALLT jag skriver investment advice. 
101 2018-12-19 18:42:28 Funny about tariffs, too -- our tariffs on Chinese goods led to their counter tariffs on US agricultural commodities.  Now, the Chinese buy soy beans from Down There and can also begin building long term relationships with Brazilian and Argentinian growers.

104 2018-12-19 18:36:02 Is the actual NSD “fun” for a recruiting journalist? Seems like lots of travel/time commitment on a single day. Outside looking in, it seems like inventory day for retail workers. Perhaps I am mistaken? Not to say players are commodities like retail goods - just clarifying.
105 2018-12-19 18:31:23 @JohnMurton in addition Excellency, the 10 tons of Emergency Reproductive Health Kits made available by @UNFPARDC are largely from the UNFPA Supplies, the largest public sector facility for RH commodities mainly funded by UK @DFID_UK congratulations
106 2018-12-19 18:31:03 IMO yes, and agreed.  Financialization requires a USD monopoly on commodities & gold.  As multi currency commodities trade grows, financialization breaks down, initially driving commodities down...but eventually up, up, up
107 2018-12-19 18:25:17 Lol. Commodities. And oil isn’t?  Beef? SB?
108 2018-12-19 18:22:34 Commodities looking at china more , no ?
109 2018-12-19 18:22:32 Could NEVER blame a player for doing what he thinks is best for him. These days 99% of players are just assets and are moved like commodities. We can nitpick how things are handled from a PR standpoint in hindsight but both player and club made the best decisions from themselves.
110 2018-12-19 18:22:10 Ignorance and stupidity are the main Commodities that FOX sells.
111 2018-12-19 18:04:29 The glut of personal data that we've surrendered to social media, especially Facebook, is one of the most valuable REAL commodities around. Data can be re-sold over & over.. too valuable.

It is NOT OK, BUT not illegal. If you must be on Facebook, share as little as you can.

114 2018-12-19 17:59:45 You finally got to the right word: commodities.  False idea (and more and more so as time goes on) and too much reliance on global markets (which is important, too, of course - it's just shouldn't be everything).

122 2018-12-19 17:17:30 Agree. They have to use their cap space going forward. And take known commodities in the early rounds of the draft. Then try to find your raw prospects in round 5-7. What smart teams do.

126 2018-12-19 17:02:07 If I can ID a system being used to attack us, open ports, getting no help from the hosting provider, often cases these are known commodities that have persisted in the face of others' reports, if I can find a way to shut it off, I will try.

128 2018-12-19 16:53:26 I believe this is why we need a competent politician, who also has the relevant qualifications ( Political science) to rules us according to how a country should be ruled, and not just think of nigeria as a SHOP and her citizens as COMMODITIES!!

131 2018-12-19 16:40:55 The current commodity for the bench mark seems to be doing more arm than good. When do we want to start earning from Tourism like Spain & UAE. And from other agric commodities like China or Isreal or from IT/Services like India. When? When?? When??? Say na like this we go dey dey
132 2018-12-19 16:33:18 El problema grande que existe con las firmas en países dependientes de commodities (y pocos diversificados) es que en su mayoría son netamente rentistas. Como en el caso de comercio (viven solo del consumo), construcción (dependen de la inversión estatal), etc.

135 2018-12-19 16:26:09 Acá solo ven países con petróleo, no commodities - en general. Esa puede ser una diferencia. No se bien la literatura, pero un canal de transmisión debería ir por el lado de las firmas: cómo se adaptan a un boom?
136 2018-12-19 16:22:24 Chévere paper! He visto trabajos relacionados pero no ha esa escala.

184 2018-12-19 13:15:43 let it sit idle if prices go up.  They essentially have a 60 year straight burn cycle independent of the economy or markets.  Not so for V or most other commodities.

192 2018-12-19 12:49:43 I am not trying to catch anything.  We follow a few commodities here with V being one.  No one ever can catch any absolute bottom at any time unless just dumb luck.

204 2018-12-19 11:38:07 I disagree with this, people like @RayDalio have shown that it is possible to value non-productive assets such as commodities, as long as you can model the supply and demand functions of those assets. This involves regression analysis rather than a DCF.
205 2018-12-19 11:34:32 The reality of life (and it was ever thus right back to the bronze age and earlier) is that nations exchange commodities and always will. It's why these arguments are just daft, Twitter fun. But, my point is- Scotland is in a very robust position to withstand all sorts of shocks.

230 2018-12-19 08:57:57 Time and energy are the most valuable commodities in the universe. One without the other is such a waste.
231 2018-12-19 08:55:15 Creativity and time will be 2019 best commodities. 

Mark this tweet.
232 2018-12-19 08:53:55 But that's exactly what the payment of roora is doing, worse with the exorbitant amounts involved nowadays. It reduces women to commodities, our rights and any bargaining power are virtually erased
233 2018-12-19 08:46:54 Sir,  please find out a real solution for farmers. If they won't grow crops what we eat. I also belongs to a farmer family. They really needs a solution. Like other commodities please give them also authority to calculate MRP according to there expense and profit.
234 2018-12-19 08:44:04 Every decade or so you have a asset class that goes into a correction, this time round its #property, a couple of years ago it was #Commodities, a decade ago #stocks etc. Take a look at Australia and even Canada, especially Vancouver, they are experiencing huge falls in values!
235 2018-12-19 08:23:11 Also Center's grant/assistance funds. In addn to inflation in prices of essential commodities, fuel(but nobody bothers in INC regimes), real estate prices balloon, thr4 rentals, thr4 goods n services, thr4 interest rates & thr4 loan EMIs.
But intellectuals Hindus will gladly pay.
236 2018-12-19 08:10:02 You know, Nackfa is now used as a trading currency between Eritrea & tigray.  Eritrean traders buy commodities in tigray using Nackfa.  Tigrayan traders coming to Eritrea  accept Nackfa.  I suppose the saints are also accepting Nackfa. Lol 
Nackfa is now the dollar of our region.

240 2018-12-19 07:56:15 Quite possibly. Or, troops are concentrated at a few key points, so that they can provide adequate security there, whilst 'security' and distribution of food and other scarce commodities elsewhere falls into the hands of whoever is organised and ruthless enough to do it.
241 2018-12-19 07:55:38 My goals have nearly been meet on Crude Oil. My main goal for Crude is the  $43-45 dollar a barrel mark!

258 2018-12-19 05:48:01 Car and Aircraft are listed in the same group, what an economist..? all harmful products which should be banned like cow slaughter in the country or put under 28% GST+cess to be levied. No commodities should be more than 18% GST in India. No 0% slab Min 2% tax for balancing it.

285 2018-12-19 04:10:18 vote bank economics is a old norm since urban people started voting out governments for slight increase in agri commodities and government started to control outpt prices for middle class vagaries.

288 2018-12-19 04:02:45 As the dept grows so will inflation, which I think may pick up next year which is good for stocks and commodities depending on how you look at it or which side of the aisle you’re on
289 2018-12-19 04:01:40 Lots of green (that's the bad one) on Chinese commodities markets today
290 2018-12-19 03:57:23 What markets though. You keep ignoring that question. Who wants it, who can refine it, and how are you going to get it to them without blowing the bank on pipelines or with inefficient outdated tankers? The world of oil commodities has blown by Alberta.
291 2018-12-19 03:46:12 Regulation is possible.  Railroad rates were regulated at the scale of individual commodities from individual origins to individual destinations.  Business had to justify rates at a high level of detail.
292 2018-12-19 03:36:56 W.D.Gann always felt stocks were paper products only. He believed in the “touchy-feely” commodities market. You can take delivery of live feeder cattle, 1000 shares on “xyz” not so much.
293 2018-12-19 03:31:41 Dylan is 100% correct... and if you do this Trading Stocks and Commodities, you'll have your handed to you... it's called FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and causes you to chase after prices that have already moved out.
294 2018-12-19 03:29:09 they still underestimate the power of voters. GST should not be more than 5% on daily use commodities.  and Prices must be same all over India after GST. at present, even one shop to another shop, price vary in the same street. WHY? reason: mindless GST Council.
295 2018-12-19 03:27:32 Yes, look at trading Stocks and Commodities... especially if each person is looking at the same data but on different time frames... Thousands of transactions take place daily... and why? Because you have an agreement on PRICE but a DISAGREEMENT on VALUE 
296 2018-12-19 03:24:03 Sweets and biscuits, what’s the difference? And yet GST on sweets is 5%. Biscuits better be coming down below that 18%/12% GST Slab for the general good of public and to maintain that office too @narendramodi @GST_Council #gst #reduction #biscuits #public #Commodities @gstindia
297 2018-12-19 03:23:44 If they continue to expand their capability to print RMB for the strategic commodities they must import ... my answer is yes. Perhaps by the skin of their teeth, and not without much pain, but in the final analysis, yes.
298 2018-12-19 03:14:39 Agree with '87 similarities and no sign of recession in the data, the differences concern me more, esp global trade dispute,  industrial commodities weakness & thematic deflationary global economy of the 21st century. LT rates have been falling last 4 years (30 yr Tbond)
299 2018-12-19 03:12:39 Well, with oil and other commodities collapsing, it surely give the Fed reason to raise rates. Just think of the potential future price increase ghat could lead to future potential inflation. 
300 2018-12-19 03:03:42 @MarkYusko hopefully a lot of that money that is getting out of stocks/bonds/commodities goes into crypto....because no other asset class has bottomed.

302 2018-12-19 02:56:18 Cryptos just like commodities are manipulated until banks fold. Sorry but I have been dealing with this shit for over a decade.

320 2018-12-19 01:40:38 Acho que o Paulinho do Estado brasileiro foi o boom de commodities, que atende ao requisito que o Leandro falou - dinheiro rápido e suficiente. E aí tá a diferença: o Vasco vendeu Paulinho e cortou na folha salarial pra lucrar, enquanto o Brasil gastou o boom em previdência.
321 2018-12-19 01:39:33 Middle class can either choose to pay this way or we can pay through increased MSP provisions and this increase prices of commodities. At least through loan waivers the money is directly reaching the farmers rather that going into middlemen’s pockets.
