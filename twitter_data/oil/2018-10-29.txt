2 2018-10-29 23:59:27 Ladies as the winter approaches don’t forget to do the maintenance on y’all cars such as: 1) Check tire pressure 2) Get your Oil change 3) remember to check y’all coolant 4) have all accessories such as - Jumper cables, Gas can , spare tires
3 2018-10-29 23:59:18 Ready to try something new? Our Nurturing Rose Shampoo & Conditioner contains a moisturising blend of coconut & olive oil for healthy hair!
4 2018-10-29 23:59:14 Exactly! Which is why I am scared to put a trade on right now, unless it is a longer term horizon. Looking at some NatGas contracts for Jan/Feb right now. Want to get on the other side of housing (esp. Canada, eh), but I may have missed my window. May need to hedge my oil income.
5 2018-10-29 23:59:08 I know that’s how I learned how to do a oil change
6 2018-10-29 23:59:05 Dude yeah what about the people who are fucking bedridden or fucked in the head or isolated depressed or stay at home mom's or a hundred thousand other things. What about the oil riggers. They get lonely. Lolz. (It's true)
7 2018-10-29 23:58:58 Oh look, he's being thoughtful and mopping the studio floors!

....with vegetable oil, the little shit.
8 2018-10-29 23:58:54 Try sesame oil or Hawaiian tropic tanning oil.  Smells great and keeps you glowing.  Yes some of us are dry too
9 2018-10-29 23:58:52 Pesto is easy as hell to make. But, if you insist on buying pre-made let me offer some advice. Don’t buy anything with sunflower seeds or cashews. Pine nuts only. No canola oil, only olive oil. And if spinach is listed before basil on the ingredients skip it.

11 2018-10-29 23:58:19 Get a Subaru they are much easier on the pocketbook. The dealership I got mine from even let my purchase a plan for free oil changes for life (as long as I own it) and it was just an extra $800.
12 2018-10-29 23:58:14 everytime i cut my cuticles i always cut one too short and it ends up bleeding or i get nail oil everywhere

16 2018-10-29 23:57:23 Ummm... fracking basically rendered coal obsolete... with natural gas and oil we don’t need coal. It’s too expensive
17 2018-10-29 23:57:20 Stew recipe is on my blog, only difference is I used goat meat, then used bleached palm oil instead of vegetable oil.

38 2018-10-29 23:56:25 You don't know much do you?  The bank rate only goes up when times are good.  Unemployment across the country is low but Alberta has a problem because of low global oil prices so corporations not investing more.  Should have looked at other business opportunities years ago.
39 2018-10-29 23:56:09 Bought some beard oil and a beard brush today. We're getting serious over here.
40 2018-10-29 23:55:47 Looks like an old archer oil barrel in the background..  Oh, great pic of you guys too!
41 2018-10-29 23:55:42 I just read one that claimed if you use oil as lube it prevents the spread of STDs if you don't use protection
42 2018-10-29 23:55:34 Please we have coal mines and oil drilling here. You're not kidding anyone.
43 2018-10-29 23:55:26 Damn who knew Mobil one sold an oil that keeps your motor safe for 20k miles, I just had to buy it
44 2018-10-29 23:55:08 @nailogical I’m trying to channel you & give my nails some love. Cuticle oil & some polish will hopefully harden them over time! Thanks for the advice

50 2018-10-29 23:54:00 I originally bought it to make cannabis oil, but then I got hungry.
51 2018-10-29 23:53:53 Can we get our 20 billion back from their oil exploration @POTUS ???
52 2018-10-29 23:53:46 All parties should be brought to justice and face the consequences. Such barbaric and inhuman or animal action must be stop. Why can’t UN take action putting sanctions to KSA or just because they are rich and world biggest oil producer

54 2018-10-29 23:53:17 My first ever memory of falling ill was my grandma forcing me to eat (palm oil) beans. It had onions in it, and the first bite I took with onions, I puked all over my school uniform. I was 5/6. I was sick that day and after. 
If I can see it, I ain't eating it.
Bless.
55 2018-10-29 23:53:16 My device doesn't give off stinky diesel exhaust.   Communicators can be recycled.  We can use sweet crude oil products over and over in our cell phones.  Not from diesel engines.

57 2018-10-29 23:52:47 @Poshmarkapp Well being professional I told her that there was no way that the soup was dirty because I have the receipt for the dry-cleaning OK which cost me 10 bucks so if you did not like my cologne oil she Could have simply gave it away as a Christmas gift.

59 2018-10-29 23:52:46 I’ll tell ya man. I worked as an oil field operator for 6 months and it’s a great job with great pay. But it takes a lot of dedication. And that goes for all jobs in the oil field
60 2018-10-29 23:52:39 ぽはやう
61 2018-10-29 23:52:20 I roll my grape leaves tight, so tight that scalding hot water, oil and lemon shoot you in the eye every bite
62 2018-10-29 23:52:16 someone told me you smell like motor oil
63 2018-10-29 23:52:07 wanted to light candles in my room but i just moisturized and coconut oil is flammable. might risk my life for those Spiced Autumn Cider smells rn
64 2018-10-29 23:52:05 The average person hasn’t a clue what the S&P closed at, what the 10YR yield is, what the Dollar index is at, Crude Oil, Copper, Gold, etc etc....
65 2018-10-29 23:51:57 BS coal and oil get funding daily from the government.
66 2018-10-29 23:51:56 Got home to: house cleaned, pantry full of groceries, house hold items bought, food cooked, new tires on my car, oil changed and a clean car. My man really is THEE best 
67 2018-10-29 23:51:48 yang oil maksudnyaa
68 2018-10-29 23:51:34 Just food for thought. Billions people yet to com if man survive. No whales for oil, no trees to burn,  oil, coal and other resources gone. 100 yrs ocean dumping still yet com back to bite.etc. Man has no handle on this. Greed dog eat dog.
69 2018-10-29 23:51:21 Lo q sucede es q desconoces el alcance de ALUR. Aparte la gran inversión se hizo en Ancap. Nuestras naftas y gas oil, y tú lo debes saber, no servían para los autos nuevos. Se solucionó. Ancap y ALUR dan trabajo a miles de uruguayos, pero eso a uds no les importa.Cuanti piormejor
70 2018-10-29 23:51:21 salt water spray & tea tree oil usually worked for me
71 2018-10-29 23:51:03 I'm really fucking annoyed that I had to work tonight and missed @hsidewinder in Leeds. I was fully willing to oil up and sit on stage in golden underwear, too.

75 2018-10-29 23:50:41 Apparently whole fats like butter are okay. They keep you full and the carbs are negligible. I always cook with it instead of oil when possible. I think I can do pulled pork if I go really light on the BBQ sauce.

77 2018-10-29 23:50:14 It is a thinly viewed attempt to raise  taxes on the middle class while exempting large companies that do most of the polluting.Oil companies and all businesses will pass on any additional cost of goods;WA state then reaps additional B&O Taxes too. This is about tax increases.

80 2018-10-29 23:49:20 Even if that was true, which it isn't, and I would know a lot more on that subject considering I'm a political science major, here's another piece of reality for you: the keystone pipeline. But you wouldn't mention that now would you? Or how about his pro-big oil policies?

87 2018-10-29 23:48:35 I’ve been so stressed and two days ago I completely lost it. Dropped all my work, drove to artworld and burnt 60k on oil paints and canvas. Painted my stress the fuck out and now I’m back to normal. It will always be an amazing way to relax.
88 2018-10-29 23:48:34 Great to hear from @NeilGlentworth at #LGAQ2018. Data - ‘the new oil that needs to be refined’.

91 2018-10-29 23:48:11 But we would become 1 and many many factorie jobs and oil field jobs new airport be built. I say do it. It would change everything. I really think it would.
92 2018-10-29 23:48:05 Makes sense and leaves more oil for exports.
93 2018-10-29 23:47:57 Mother Teresa
If you want a love message to be heard, it has got to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it.

97 2018-10-29 23:47:16 I want my dog to look as good as the famous Pomeranians Boo or Jiff, so I put coconut oil on his coat regularly and massage it on his skin. Keeps him fluffy and healthy. Might as well get him a little durag. *Googles durags for dogs and puppies*
98 2018-10-29 23:47:09 The law doesn't stop him from using anointed oil, handkerchief or water but it's strict on the registration, sell and marketing of medicines.
99 2018-10-29 23:46:59 Nigeria's main infrastructure challenge is to maintain the ports, airports, roads and bridges built during the Oil Boom era - before we get to building new ones.

But our maintenance culture is so poor that we have to reconstruct a lot of them.
100 2018-10-29 23:45:59 I’m shocked, yes shocked that Steyer who made billions, Yes billions in the oil sector would turn his back on it and go wacko green energy. I’m now thinking he’s in it only for the money. Am I wrong?

105 2018-10-29 23:45:15 The good part is you can get in in oil so you can smoke it but i know some people don't like to smoke there are also gummies topicals idk what kind of pain you have but its defiantly worth a try!

112 2018-10-29 23:43:39 You tell me that the Democrats don't support Wars, still in Afghanistan: is that about the opium trade? Talk to me about how we're expanding our freedom by supporting Saudi Arabia. No Democrat votes against it or Israel for that matter the whole Arab war: oil
113 2018-10-29 23:43:36 Hanty, I tell peeps there are no rich folks in Nigeria. When I use to live in the US, in my line of work I meet millionaires who collect 100s of millions on royalties from interest in oil fields and that live on the same street as you and you have never even heard of them

A place where I could fill my tank, buy a qt of oil and not have to wait behind a guy who's grocery shopping for the week, playing the lottery and buying a slice of pizza so he doesn't starve to death on his 2 mile drive home.

123 2018-10-29 23:42:04 One lf her many problems is no one can believe A word she says.  She supports drilling. She doesn't support drilling.  She's gonna get a waiver.  We don't need a waiver bc there's no oil and its "moot".    Gee Katie which is it??

130 2018-10-29 23:40:36 Next time put a plastic cap on before the stocking cap then glue, if you don’t have a wig head to make it on. Also, always lay your closure first if you have a lace closure. Glue remover, oil (I’ve used olive oil before)/oil sheen, and a good conditioner will get it off.
131 2018-10-29 23:40:36 Random story time: when I was in 7th grade I asked my dad how gas stations worked. He told me that they had to find oil in the ground before they could build a gas station.... we lived in Tx so this was slightly believable but I asked if they just put pipes underground 1/

142 2018-10-29 23:39:14 My sympathy to your wife (and you).  In preference to vegetable oil I'd recommend  Danish Oil (or Tung Oil) if you can get them in the US. It gives a really nice finish - I think - and can be taken off and re-applied if it gets messed up....
143 2018-10-29 23:39:10 It was the olive oil on the foccacia that got me.

145 2018-10-29 23:37:59 What if oil is the “lubricant” for earth.. and since we keep draining it, that’s why the earth is getting hotter?
146 2018-10-29 23:37:55 There is engine oil in your dm
147 2018-10-29 23:37:54 House Autry Medium Hot breader. Veggie oil unless you wanna go high dollar with peanut. Have your oil at 375 cause it’s going to rapidly drop to 350 when you put the fish in. When it floats squeeze the water out & you’re good.
148 2018-10-29 23:37:44 Should I be worried if I’m 200+ miles over needing an oil change? 
149 2018-10-29 23:37:38 熾烈すぎる…
150 2018-10-29 23:37:37 今度気が向いたら遊びに行くわ
151 2018-10-29 23:37:34 He throwing blessing oil from the pullpit when he hear about this one  .. immediate alter call when y’all pull up 
152 2018-10-29 23:37:26 Literally all I want for Christmas are painting/drawing materials. Brushes, oil paints, acrylic paints, charcoal, pencils, canvases, and definitely a better easel than the one I have now. 
153 2018-10-29 23:37:10 Yep and I'm sick & tired of it!! 

#VoteRedToSaveAmerica 
154 2018-10-29 23:37:07 I learned how to change my tire and my oil. I’m pretty sure YouTube can teach me this too
155 2018-10-29 23:37:05 There is no future in tar sand oil & pipelines
156 2018-10-29 23:37:04 I still don’t care
157 2018-10-29 23:36:49 Yeah everyone needs a home base. Even solid snake in his video games despite that he’s a super spy badass but has an entire floating oil rig turned hideout and is greeted by his 2nd in command with “the men will be glad your back they missed you” wish I was making any of that up

160 2018-10-29 23:35:54 Turkey bought oil from ISIS, illegally invaded Afrin using jihadi proxies & currently protects HTS (Al Queda) in Idlib. #terroristturkey
161 2018-10-29 23:35:53 “This oil is 90% and you texted me so many times anD I JUST COULDNT TEXT BACK”
162 2018-10-29 23:35:49 Don't think it was clutch with a trail of smoke. More like hydraulic oil loss.
163 2018-10-29 23:35:41 They are hundreds of millions people, the western world can't support them all.Their countries are full of oil and mineral resources that's where the answer is.
164 2018-10-29 23:35:18 All done now but used canola and olive oil.
165 2018-10-29 23:35:17 Sometimes I think the snake oil peddlers of old had it right; alcohol cures everything.
166 2018-10-29 23:35:13 No mention of Chavez's failure to diversify the economy from oil, his botched nationalizations, driving out businesses & destroying the economy in the process. What a shame, a country with the largest oil reserves in the world & once Latin America's wealthiest is now its poorest.
167 2018-10-29 23:35:03 (He wasn't kidding about not using oil to burn the body btw, that s*** stinks to high heaven, I mean you're a chef you probably already know that.)
168 2018-10-29 23:35:03 Im cutting up for oil.
169 2018-10-29 23:35:00 Yeah because vegan cheese, which typically has palm oil, is fantastic for animals

173 2018-10-29 23:34:47 Check again, Brian.  The '88 bid was awarded in '81.  '81 = high oil prices, booming economy, happy people.  The crash didn't happen until 1984.  Why is #YesYYC2026 always lying about everything?  You people are sick.
174 2018-10-29 23:34:40 Yasss im so excited for the new releases. I hope you drop the hair oil .
175 2018-10-29 23:34:27 buy some cheap hair oil and use the whole bottle to loosen it

177 2018-10-29 23:34:05 Trump’s a snake oil salesman too, so it makes sense that you would try that line on me.
178 2018-10-29 23:34:01 Use a conditioner or oil sheen
179 2018-10-29 23:34:00 Right, I’ve never changed it up. Always mustard, lettuce, salt and pepper, oil and vinegar but my hot sandwiches vary it’s the craziest thing
180 2018-10-29 23:33:49 not yo mention their gas was refined by Shell Oil and IG Farben & on it goes
181 2018-10-29 23:33:45 The worst part about losing my virginity meant I couldn’t compare myself to olive oil anymore

185 2018-10-29 23:33:10 wood, coal, oil, natural gas

186 2018-10-29 23:33:00 Put Baby Oil On That Bad Boy And Get It Off!
187 2018-10-29 23:32:53 yeah but the same is true about solar and oil so...
188 2018-10-29 23:32:47 Sir jee can you change the brand please, leave the Olive Oil for Sharjeel. You were really nice person before this Olive Oil brand.
189 2018-10-29 23:32:39 Metaphors Aaron, metaphors. 

You don’t have to literally sell snake oil, or even to literally sell anything, to be a snake oil salesman.

192 2018-10-29 23:32:33 What does this have to do with olive oil?
193 2018-10-29 23:32:31 Eso es evidente. Q Toledo y PPK se asocien para cobrar millones a Hunt Oil x Camisea y a Odebrecht x la Interoceanica, no es culpa de ONG alguna, como en otros casos. Pero q IDL, financiada gracias a Toledo, solo exista con un objetivo político e ideológico esta mal.
194 2018-10-29 23:32:30 #Iranunveiled Although the Iranian Government treat women horrendously we also need to remember the cause of why. Remember when the Shah wanted to raise oil prices and it didn’t fit with the agenda and caused a Coup?... Yep... That’s why...
195 2018-10-29 23:32:30 It’s happened.. I am the mom and friend that has an oil, lotion or tea for “that” in my purse at all times
196 2018-10-29 23:32:25 Black seed oil is the truth.
197 2018-10-29 23:32:23 We can remind you of how great it is to have a pension when he has destroyed the rainforest and we all suffer from a lack of oxygen and die. You won’t need your pension when the Rainforest is Privatised and they cut down all the trees for Palm Oil

201 2018-10-29 23:31:56 There is simply no way Brazil could become like Venezuela. We export a lot of food and oil. No one in their right mind would give up this pile of money.
202 2018-10-29 23:31:54 Alright so we have a carbon tax.  What's changed? Transportation? Nope,  Commute? Nope, Oil based products? Nope Tires, Roads Asphalt? Nope. Construction and infrastructure? Nope.  Federal Government revenue? Yes. Poor people poorer? Yes.
203 2018-10-29 23:31:49 I think it would be very informative to see which public figures invest their personal wealth in arms manufacturing and / or oil or other fossil fuels. #wealth #investing #uspoli #politics #news

208 2018-10-29 23:30:39 I read unemployment rate is 60% on Native American reservations straddling North/South Dakota!  With an oil boom in the Dakotas, leading to many other spin off jobs of every kind,when will EVERYONE JOIN THE MELTING POT that is the UNITED STATES?  Nations within Nations dont work.
209 2018-10-29 23:30:36 Ok. Following the secret olive oil river on Insta. Liquid gold beckons.
210 2018-10-29 23:30:33 With 50 years of oil reserves left planes may not be as big a thing as they are today. Now high-speed rail projects...
211 2018-10-29 23:30:05 WOW great perspective on how the revenues can be used for the food of the country and on top of this our country has the strongest climate policies for extracting oil while Saudi, Iran, Qatar not so much. @WBrettWilson @BradWall306 @SheilaGunnReid

217 2018-10-29 23:29:13 We need some Ligurian olive oil, fresh rosemary and sage, and malt extract and we can make the focaccia. Also wine.
218 2018-10-29 23:29:12 What type of oil are you using?
219 2018-10-29 23:29:03 Don’t ever purchase another bottle of CBD oil before contacting me. Trust me on this. If you aren’t yet familiar with CBD, you will be.
220 2018-10-29 23:28:51 You mentioned mostly health issues and apparently Sambit Patra is a medical surgeon who now has to justify his pay as a director on the board of PSU oil company ONGC. So he has to rant something to please his party's bosses.
221 2018-10-29 23:28:48 What politicians do you think benefit from these unjust wars?? Did you know Bush and oil companies in general made money from going to war with Iraq? Who ended that war btw?
222 2018-10-29 23:28:36 I need a hot oil treatment. 
223 2018-10-29 23:28:31 I don't trust Notley and she has worked to collapse most of the oil industry with taxes but, especially, regulations. 
A friendly smile while she knifes Albertans in the back.
I can't wait for an election.
224 2018-10-29 23:28:23 Shea butter is your friend, so is coconut and jojoba oil.

Cocoa butter seems more like a temporary fix

Ps sugar scrubs are your friend.

And while my skin doesn't go ashy per se, it sure does unpleasant things this time of year...

232 2018-10-29 23:26:43 I heat it up in a frying pan with olive oil the oven takes too long to heat up for my hungry ass
233 2018-10-29 23:26:23 this is what made learning to cook so damn hard for me -- I had to look up *lots* of things every time I tried to cook
recipe: use a neutral oil
me: *looks that up*
r: with a high smoke point
m: *looks that up*
234 2018-10-29 23:26:12 Ofui.
You have a "black oil heart" instead.
Your leg like MTN short code

Aboaa pii
235 2018-10-29 23:25:57 Glad I got my oil changed !
236 2018-10-29 23:25:23 I know it will hurt being a country fellow. I didn’t create the report, I was shocked too as Nigeria is an oil rich country. It’s a recent report issued in June 2018.
237 2018-10-29 23:25:22 I’m sure you will get @Tesla back. You still have @SpaceX. I blame these big oil companies.
238 2018-10-29 23:25:08 Came with Henry to change his oil and its fucken boring wish there was more people to talk to..
239 2018-10-29 23:24:59 Obama only doubled the deficit. If you dont know what's going on stop watching CNN. Do you own a home?  Have 401K? Understand consumer confidence,  energy independence,  3.5% GDP, lowest unemployment in history, VA accountability. 2nd largest oil producer in the world? Come on.
240 2018-10-29 23:24:50 Don’t get me started on deforestation, the orangutangs, and palm oil!!!! It’s in everything ... look it up 
241 2018-10-29 23:24:42 I'm coming over with some extra virgin olive oil 
242 2018-10-29 23:24:40 Dilma Roussef was a bank robber and part of the resistance to the military dictatorship. She has an extensive criminal record. She was also at the helm of Petrobras during the golden years of high oil prices. This was also the same time that the PT govt used it as an ATM
243 2018-10-29 23:24:21 You can't trust the snake oil salesman......he always has something up his sleeve.  I won't believe it until I see the Headlines " Olympic bid is DEAD" and see Nenshi crying .
244 2018-10-29 23:24:20 jk I don't wanna see u just bring your car over so I can change the oil then u can get your butt home
245 2018-10-29 23:24:19 Had a car accident recently (bad one). Went for a massage today to work out aches and pains. W/O asking provider used CBD oil for my massage

249 2018-10-29 23:24:00 Rare for a HS QB, Wortham is consistently under center. And I mean UNDER. Like he’s doing an oil change on the center. Pass for no gain. Third down and 15!
250 2018-10-29 23:23:51 Developed country telling developing what to do with it's resources? We need rainforestS, we also need oil, copper, gold, silver, lithium, waterways, etc. What makes this different? Colonization by press. Diplomats should work to help instead of US press shaming a democracy.

262 2018-10-29 23:22:41 Like the oil?
263 2018-10-29 23:22:17 So came to get my oil changed and was told I’m driving a ticking time bomb, wish me luck
264 2018-10-29 23:22:14 mostly nuclear, but the other stuff that you burn for energy such as wood, coal, and oil could all produce it
265 2018-10-29 23:21:56 EXACTLY. You should be choosing not to loot bodies because you need to run. It should have a sense of urgency! Instead it feels like trying to steer an oil tanker around the Isle of Wight
266 2018-10-29 23:21:51 Lights. They were stolen and got up, 7 virgins all 7
Outside. Our lamps are going out, Give us of your oil. We Wise, The Wise One
267 2018-10-29 23:21:42 So I brought my vehicle to the dealership to get an oil change and it’s gonna be two hours minimum of waiting 
268 2018-10-29 23:21:40 omg yes  and then as I suspected somebody in the comments said “you must got you an oil field worker type nigga” bc those dudes be the main ones whose bathtubs be like this 
269 2018-10-29 23:21:27 I could use an oil change and a tire rotation. :-)
270 2018-10-29 23:20:59 I drink this tea from whole foods called “womens moon cycle tea” & “ginger tea” I also use this aromatherapy oil called “clary sage oil” which you can also find at whole foods. And I take turmeric pills.
271 2018-10-29 23:20:58 Petrolia Fire responded in the 4800 block of Oil Heritage Rd. for a medical assist with Lambton EMS. One pt. was transported to hospital. All clear.
272 2018-10-29 23:20:57 Fr I’m so used to the forgiving nature of oil paints and watercolors that I forgot how hard they were lmao
273 2018-10-29 23:20:35 Ações da Taurus vão a 140%. Flavio B* fala em guerra c/ Venezuela. Trump ao parabenizar B* diz que vão trabalhar em nova cooperação militar. Ele tem o "oil" brasileiro, mas a maior reserva do mundo é da Venezuela. Estou vesgo ou vejo sinais de catástrofe?
274 2018-10-29 23:20:22 Baby oil me please 
275 2018-10-29 23:20:12 but only if properly cooked in screaming hot oil...

277 2018-10-29 23:19:43 Fresh oil, clean filter, and a jeep co clean I could eat off from it.

292 2018-10-29 23:18:01 Working at one of the largest oil refineries in the Caribbean. Whew chile..... and my catering gig is slowly taking off. Hard work pays off and being kind to ppl.
293 2018-10-29 23:17:49 Chancellor's  "unexpected windfall" came mainly from oil & gas revenues. It delivered more than £350m per week extra. Scotland gets less than 3 weeks worth of that. The other 49 weeks? That goes to rUK. Just think about that! What could we do with that? #ItsScotlandsOil #indyref2
294 2018-10-29 23:17:15 Centralized burning gets you somewhat higher efficiency, and you can use industrial emission scrubbing. Somewhere between 2/3 and 1/3 the impact of burning it in a car directly.

But EVs are also a lot heavier than liquid-burners. They cost more oil to move in manufacturing.

302 2018-10-29 23:15:41 No. I have read some of these books. I know who writes them. Why are you investing your loyalty into oil backed propaganda books? They are propaganda. Funded by mostly the heartland institute. Does a single one of these books to first hand science?

304 2018-10-29 23:15:34 Hey Mr Fehir....don’t forget we  have a seaport, which could be an outlet for Mb. Sask. Alb. oil. Manitoba also has Natural gas and has Hydro Electric power. We’re not happy with Trudeau either, so why are we on probation.
305 2018-10-29 23:15:25 We already have a pipeline to the coast and all the oil goes to the US market. 

The US is the only market that wants the product.

TMX is just another route to the US.

Cruz is for the border wall and is pro 2nd Amendment, pro life and Beto is opposed to all of these. That’s a few.
327 2018-10-29 23:12:06 Yes!! Hot oil treatments are BOMB!!! I recommend using them once a month. You can use any natural oil I heat it in a microwave safe bowl and then warm it up.

The masking scents are GRIM. *olfactory flashback to a closet full of sweaty faux buckskin* Maybe fish oil is not so bad.

350 2018-10-29 23:09:04 The biggest source of CO2 in Canada? The people who use fossil fuel. Farmers, taxi drivers, truckers and parents taking kids to school. Not big oil. The carbon tax doesn’t hurt big oil. It hurts the Canadian consumers.
351 2018-10-29 23:08:41 this oil got my whole scalp freezing
352 2018-10-29 23:08:36 has anyone attempted to put CBD oil in a juul?

357 2018-10-29 23:08:01 But what is NOT SH fault is.......illegal migrants, ISIS returning to kill , carbon tax, nafta 2.0, BILLIONS of debt, lowers oil prices, 200K oil workers out of work, investors leaving , Khadr 10.5 mil, the list is endless.
358 2018-10-29 23:08:00 IF that is from a human (Big IF) try laundry detergent. Breaks down the oil & grease that we naturally produce exceptionally well.

370 2018-10-29 23:06:49 a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey,
371 2018-10-29 23:06:18 Well, my 24 hours in No Dakota — my 50th — was interesting. And it concluded by driving thru the traffic and helter-skelter of a fracking/oil boom town, on a native reservation no less. Glad to put a visual on what I’ve read.

374 2018-10-29 23:06:01 Have you tried decarboxylated CBD oil? It's very concentrated, so you won't need to buy as much of it. Dogs respond really well to the decarb, we always recommend it paired with a tincture. I hope he does better!! 
375 2018-10-29 23:05:49 All that talk about women not checking shit on their cars made check my oil lol. Damn sure put more back in that thang

381 2018-10-29 23:05:29 Yes, but EVs don’t get most people away from oil extraction currently. France is the exception. Thanks to NIMBYs elsewhere, most countries burn oil, coal, or natural gas for the bulk of their power generation.

387 2018-10-29 23:04:31 See what they forced me to do because they’ve ignored me for so long.
388 2018-10-29 23:04:19 It's not fancy but goddamn it's delicious. Get in a car and google the closest Dibella's Subs. Get it "hot" on everything bread with their oil dressing...It'll have you back on that electric keyboard in no time.
389 2018-10-29 23:04:15 Oil can
390 2018-10-29 23:04:07 Sometimes I'll fry one in sesame oil or just crack it on top and let it sit for a few minutes 
391 2018-10-29 23:03:56 I guess that the oil windfall promised as part of Indyref would have made all the difference... if only oil prices had not tanked.  Suggest you revisit your party's financial pledges in its "Scotland's Future" manifesto and suspend the hypocrisy!
392 2018-10-29 23:03:21 Menendez was cleared of all charges. He was admonished 4 not reporting gifts. So all the gifts the GOP takes from the gun lobby, big pharma, the oil industry + more, to push their agenda is ok by u but not Menendez’s actions. Hypocrisy again.

399 2018-10-29 23:02:45 I love it.  Do you think she knows what OPEC is?  What's her stance on drilling for oil in Alaska and/or fracking?  Do her parents live within the range of an electric car?   I have so many questions!

402 2018-10-29 23:02:26 I don't know how much hydraulic oil is aboard diesel/electric subs like #ARASanJuan , but I wouldn't think it was a lot. As I recall, the USS Thresher (located by CDR Ballard) was found in many pieces with the propeller and shaft completely separated but intact.

407 2018-10-29 23:02:03 Maxine just always lets loose with how insane she is & Dims just suck it up like it's gravy. She wants to nationalize all the oil companies like Venezuela & run them like the wacko Russians she not so secretly admires...
408 2018-10-29 23:01:45 I'm white but I can relate. I still have yet to find the thing that eases the cracking and flaking I get in winter. The closest thing so far is coconut oil but it makes me smell like a deep fryer so I don't really like it.

421 2018-10-29 23:00:40 Sure - though I doubt it’s worse than oil extraction overall. So the aim is to make it cheaper in all currencies, for example by improving battery chemistry (in multiple respects).

428 2018-10-29 22:59:27 That's not completely fair. He told 
@paigereports_ he would comment in 8 days, assuming he keeps keeps a scheduled Nov 2 radio interview. Meanwhile, Big Oil up to ~$30 million in spending. #waelex
429 2018-10-29 22:59:15 I like zucchini sautéed with olive oil, sautéed hot so they get a little brown, same with carbonzo beans and add couscous, salt, pepper...wine or beer, organic chocolate.
430 2018-10-29 22:58:42 I was basic this year and did one batch with olive oil and salt, the other with butter and salt. They were both good

444 2018-10-29 22:56:18 carra needs lessons in economics it’s no surprise he isn’t a manager he’d bankrupt clubs who don’t have oil money
445 2018-10-29 22:55:53 Joy Behar & Meghan McCain are like Oil & Water they always bump heads eventually & when not playing nice always end up where they first started naturally. Different Values & Opinions! The Show is Toxic!
446 2018-10-29 22:55:37 After a month in Italy, I can confirm that the only essential oil is extra virgin olive.

448 2018-10-29 22:55:29 Full body coconut oil rinses are literally my favorite thing to do. It’s a workout bc you really have to massage and spread. Butttttt my skin is so soft and smooth and it also lightened my stretch marks, elbows, back of my ankles and by knees

453 2018-10-29 22:54:21 Ahah, yes, hyperinflation in brazil, argentina, mexico in 1989, was due to the oil crisis in 1979. Please show me evidence that unemployment is half thanks to price instability. And wage indexation shows you just dont understand why high inflation is bad. Go to Caracas, genius.

458 2018-10-29 22:53:31 Right. Post-modern humans - agents of the dumb.
Actually, it's even worse. That noise - from ship engines, undersea drilling, and 'air guns' that map for oil - leads to lethal ear & brain hemorrhaging in dolphins & whales and maybe also to mass beachings.
459 2018-10-29 22:53:24 The American West is full of ghost towns that used to be thriving with mansions, hotels and opera houses. But their economies were based on commodities, gold or silver, just like Saudi Arabia's is based on oil. But when the mines played out, the towns died. Better diversify.

461 2018-10-29 22:53:06 So, what’s with the new CBD Oil craze? Is it really something that works for chronic pain I wonder?
462 2018-10-29 22:52:45 3 years straight he’s torn up pre season ands got everybody amped up.  Then when the big boys come to play.....  I also believe the oil aren’t doing damage til he reaches his potential.

466 2018-10-29 22:52:11 Unfortunately for Saudia alternative is hardly attractive. Getting boxed out of the Chinese market will increasingly mean having to dump excess oil inventories on the global stage, thereby ensuring a sustained low price for oil..with its budget deficit stuck at about 16% of GDP=>

468 2018-10-29 22:52:03 What is an “essential oil?”  Gas?  Diesel?  85W90?  Wesson?  Note:  I’m keeping this “clean.”
469 2018-10-29 22:52:01 I agree with yo last part. But its upto those doubters to do their clinical tests, etc. Then they too can make use of it in their institutions. But just like his water, oil, etc, he may use it in his circles im sure.
470 2018-10-29 22:51:26 Just hearing Morrison sruiking how good self & LNP are. He always sounds like a desperate snake oil salesman, hoping to dupe his listeners into belief & buying his fake cure before they have time to think.
471 2018-10-29 22:51:24 The good news is crude oil prices continue to fall and thereby petrol and diesel prices will be reduced. But if any major infra projects commenced during 2014 was completed then the sentiments would be different. It seems only late 2019 or 2020 only when something will be visible

I was calling the "fade the rally" trade all morning. There was absolutely no justification for 35+ ramp

FX, Credit, HYG, Oil all rolled over way before $SPX
479 2018-10-29 22:50:10 This oil pen is the best investment I’ve made thus far into 2018.
480 2018-10-29 22:50:08 It's really weird to think tyat people are saying this about MEGATRON of all people. The maniacal villain who blew up oil platforms in G1. Really shows how much @jroberts332 knows how to write. 

And he should keep writing. For #TransformersCyberverse. I want cartoon Lost Light.

482 2018-10-29 22:50:01 Thank you. I’ve reduced my intake of morphine massively but have started cbd oil legally available and helps. So imagine what the real stuff would do. I’d give anything to not be in as much pain, I really would x

488 2018-10-29 22:49:16 Iraq war was unquestionably disastrous. Part of what I resented the most was the effort to preclude acquisition of oil in discussions of why we went in and equating opposition to the war with a lack of patriotism, or even worse, sympathy with terrorists.
489 2018-10-29 22:49:11 Seriously? I thought “austerity was over” not “austerity is coming to an end”. I work in oil and earn reasonably well, so I’ll benefit from this budget, but can see the destruction that the .@Conservatives are reaping on the country (NHS, council services, etc)
490 2018-10-29 22:49:10 Man dis sick shit for the birds . Who got some oil for the low ?

495 2018-10-29 22:48:55 I'm powerfully curious about whether this works, but not currently curious or desperate enough to try it. We've had some limited success with quilt soap on stains from coconut oil and chicken grease.
496 2018-10-29 22:48:49 My friend just told me he knew a girl who got her oil changed just once and that’s it. Drove that shit up to 25k

Ouch. Poor car.
497 2018-10-29 22:48:43 Water and oil don't coalesce either.
498 2018-10-29 22:48:32 Oh man, here comes another 20 Mill fine for sarcasm. You should drill and spill oil in the gulf of Mexico, those guys never get in trouble.
499 2018-10-29 22:48:01 Tools for the US Army to employ against invaders; water cannons, smoke bombs, barbed wire, moats filled with oil, attack dogs, marijuana smoke, rubber bullets, loud speakers giving directions back to Honduras!

501 2018-10-29 22:47:53 I long for the old days when you could pour boiling oil on them.
502 2018-10-29 22:47:47 It's a misuse of military forces.

Trump is sending troops to border for political purposes to sway a national election.

Wait til he & his new dictator pal in  get together.

512 2018-10-29 22:45:40 In my small town it is totally oil based. All about the oil so of course that equates to a conservative. I just see us going backward. I will probably vote Green Party as I don't think they will have a viable candidate for the Liberal or NDP here. Not that Green will win.

519 2018-10-29 22:44:45 Personally, I lather up with coconut oil after I bathe/shower...if I use nothing, my skin would hurt and itch from being dry. I use lotion primarily for my hands. But since I'm lighter skinned, you can't see my ashiness. 
520 2018-10-29 22:44:42 I am a strong independent woman and I shall monitor my tire pressure and learn how to fill it with air. And learn how to replace the wiper fluid. And diligently get oil changes. And not forget to fill gas.
521 2018-10-29 22:44:40 The President of the United States is a feckless carnival barker and snake oil salesman, an unscrupulous political huckster and morally degenerate bullshitter that's cyncially and recklessly tearing at the fabric of this nation for his own political expediency.

561 2018-10-29 22:39:37 Very! But attempts to displace oil tax burden onto other resource sectors is going to be a huge political fight given their significance for employment across Siberia/Far East. Kozak's in a bind. Interesting case of picking constituencies to hurt without reform.

So yeah... Alarmists

627 2018-10-29 22:31:18 It's pretty obvious not burning oil and gas would reduce carbon emissions, not increase them.

714 2018-10-29 22:19:49 Harper never debated anything or anyone in his life and can only talk out of a dark closet.  Oil will only save our country now if it becomes nationalized.   Drugs are the only game in Alberta.
715 2018-10-29 22:19:28 @ABCBreaking247 You guys need to lift your game. Finance report this morning quoted oil at over $80US when it was middle $77US. Should be simple to get those numbers correct - sloppy!
716 2018-10-29 22:19:27 Many of these peak oil / uranium models based on current technology however technology is always changing. Technology makes finding / extracting resources easier (look at the shale frac revolution). Resources can be found if price incentivizes them.

748 2018-10-29 22:14:21 no, I posted it because the situation is obviously not clear cut and because of its emphasis on gas, which as a generality I approve of rather than oil - I regard the latter as too valuable a resource to be expended on 'end use' purposes.

846 2018-10-29 22:04:00 When I bought the car, they peddled a lifetime warranty on the drivetrain if I had all the service (oil changes, tires, etc) done with that dealer. I asked at the time, because I knew I'd have to move, if there were dealers in other cities where I could get oil changed if I moved

851 2018-10-29 22:03:22 Definitely try coconut oil or conditioner
852 2018-10-29 22:03:21 Hell of a day. Dropped my car off because of a possible oil leak. Still waiting on a final verdict on that. And then my upstairs neighbors had a plumber in which sent filth water into our closet, causing a major mess and destroying a whole load of my wife's shoes.
853 2018-10-29 22:03:12 First is was global warming. Now, mankind, is able to effect climate change. And many thought the gulf of Mexico would be all oil now...
854 2018-10-29 22:03:00 Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro gets an oil windfall with output poised to soar higher-Morgan Stanley sees state oil firm Petrobras’s output up 12% in 2019.

862 2018-10-29 22:02:32 Good news: I finally got a long overdue oil change on my car.
Bad news: It's still my car.

870 2018-10-29 22:01:34 Remember, if a supplement says "Approved by the homeopathic association" or something similar, then its snake oil. Homeopathic salesman are not doctors, and homeopathy has not been found to have ANY medicinal effect, its placebo nothing more.

Really expensive placebo.

876 2018-10-29 22:01:07 How come katie Arrington hasn't AREADY used her pull with trump to get an exemption for SC for off-shore oil drilling? She lies and so happy local mayors see through her. @KatieArrington2 #votefor joe Cunningham
877 2018-10-29 22:01:01 Oil is expensive these days... So you know if its worth it!
878 2018-10-29 22:00:58 my dad should be so proud of me.. I’m getting my car cleaned and oil changed lol.

882 2018-10-29 22:00:39 In the next 100 is my guess.  About When the oil runs out in the Middle East! or sooner if the west gets its renewables act together.

885 2018-10-29 22:00:28 @ScottMorrisonMP @theage “as the son of a policeman I think crime out of control in Victoria” (despite nearly 10% down). My dad was a mechanic...oil change anyone? #VicVotes2018
886 2018-10-29 22:00:28 Prepared it with some lime, black pepper, and garlic powder then cooked it in some organic olive oil lol
887 2018-10-29 22:00:24 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
888 2018-10-29 22:00:16 If you care to notice: I put nuclear *with* renewable. Gas and oil need to be actively eliminated by policy, period.
889 2018-10-29 22:00:06 They won’t. Just like, say, Malta, Finland, Iceland..... None who were part of colonial empire want back either. Plus Scotland only receives 10% of oil/whisky revenues, rest kept by UK Gov.
890 2018-10-29 22:00:01 It’s me ya girl, cooking with a crop top and hot oil again because I just don’t fucking care anymore.
891 2018-10-29 21:59:40 You seem sharp. But global warming is ALL about the data and science. The oil companies and FOX News have worked hard to make it a political issue but it’s not.
892 2018-10-29 21:59:23 Asked my partner about it, all we can come up with is (A) an aftermarket oil cooler was installed up there and is leaking, or (B) something that was put in the frunk is leaking

898 2018-10-29 21:59:09 Very true , why do you think they want to block us ? NI are ok to have a referendum as is Wales  to go independent but WAIT NOT Scotland!!!  It’s about money, oil , tourism. May I say more 
899 2018-10-29 21:59:08 Maybe Prophet Magaya has some kind of 'annointed' oil (otherwise known as oil) mixed with surf ultra concoction to cure this.
900 2018-10-29 21:58:57 Full extract cannabis oil! 
901 2018-10-29 21:58:47 This OLine has brought me back into Lucas Oil Stadium again.
902 2018-10-29 21:58:36 Now Russia and China have more free time to seize more oil contracts, and smugglers have some free zones because the military is only taking care of a border. Wow They're destroying America and then picking up the pieces
903 2018-10-29 21:58:28 自分がめっちゃニンニク臭いーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
904 2018-10-29 21:58:05 All my AB people who were all for saving the world when that NatGeo climate change paper came out a couple weeks ago who still continue to support the expansion of the oil industry: please consider the hypocrisy in this Yes we still need oil, but we need to reduce the need for it
905 2018-10-29 21:57:59 This is why the oil companies argument that smog is an issue is so Clearly untrue #e15 it’s actually better than 99% of the Fuel supply
906 2018-10-29 21:57:55 I hate when mufuckas try to be slick like mufucka you can’t be slicker than a can of oil MUFUCKA I am the can of oil

909 2018-10-29 21:57:43 So oil is infinite?
My country uses 80% renewables - aiming for 100%. Our quality of life is higher than yours. We also have really clean air which is awesome.
910 2018-10-29 21:57:32 my misfortunes at the moment:
-i have a headache. 
-google says to put peppermint oil on your forehead. 
-i put peppermint oil on my forehead. 
-i read further and google says to dilute it first. 
-i did not dilute it. 
-i think its getting in my eyes.
-everything burns.

912 2018-10-29 21:56:59 He likely ingested a healthy dose of gun oil, if it's any consolation to anyone.
913 2018-10-29 21:56:58 How stupid you are are. Isis has money, from Russia and oil! LOTS OF IT  they don’t need or want to walk two thousand miles to come in our country. Isis is not even powerful and you don’t even know there’s a new group out thanks to trump more powerful and more evil than ever!
914 2018-10-29 21:56:51 Naval blockade on Saudi Arabia, I mean what are they really going to do? They can choke on their oil, last I checked, and I am an oil analyst by trade, USA produced more. Like DT said they would not last a week without USA to protect them.
915 2018-10-29 21:56:47 I haven't even started yet if that spoof site on Pete is still up. 

If is..

You ain't seen nothing yet!
916 2018-10-29 21:56:30 Plz ffs if getting sick of city becoming my most hated club oil money
917 2018-10-29 21:56:30 Finally some payoff for destroying their country for trying to trade oil in Euro's.
At least now they have a proper Central Bank.
Oh, and we liberated all those ancient secrets lying around UR.
918 2018-10-29 21:56:27 I'm not British by the way, but an Irish citizen, of German birth, lived in the UK on and off. Many oil my friends are UK Irish. Your generalisation is misleading and damaging, and I suspect you yourself know better.
919 2018-10-29 21:56:26 Oil money
920 2018-10-29 21:56:11 It's like playing in an oil painting, truly stunning 
921 2018-10-29 21:55:53 Merkel is a liar and a Globalist. She is the reason Germany is paying for a pipeline to pump oil out of Russia. Germany needs to be hit with our most dire Tariffs. Germany is no friend of America. Actions speak louder than words.
922 2018-10-29 21:55:51 紳士的にセーフ！
923 2018-10-29 21:55:24 Word on the street is that UKOG may be buying Shares back from Solo with cash from oil?
924 2018-10-29 21:55:22 Definitely getting an oil change tomorrow.
925 2018-10-29 21:55:05 THERE WAS NO oil embargo in 73.  Our Gov wanted everyone to use foreign oil & gas & US could keep their's.  WE suffered so that our Country could be largest exporter of oil in world.  Think about it!
926 2018-10-29 21:55:01 Yes! I love coconut oil. Leaves your skin so soft
927 2018-10-29 21:55:00 Oil pulling with coconut oil is the tits Ima get back on that
928 2018-10-29 21:55:00 what was it about the Oil Billionaires plying away at the NFL stadium that prompted this tweet, Liam?
929 2018-10-29 21:54:54 Baby oil, mousse, oil sheen , shampoo. Anything to help slip it out
930 2018-10-29 21:54:48 面白いです。

マルディグラも日本のハロウィンの乱痴気騒ぎと似てますが、
普段は路上での飲酒も出来ない文化の制約があってのマルディグラの解放感ですので、日本のように元々何でもありだとハロウィンもただの乱痴気騒ぎになってしまうのかもしれません。
931 2018-10-29 21:54:23 Hook me up with that squirrel oil and tack ankles or some shit. 
932 2018-10-29 21:54:06 Add two cups of olive oil then stir vigorously.
933 2018-10-29 21:53:49 I hate the smell of sesame oil with a passion. I love it in food. So when someone leaves the cap open and it spills...guess who is feeling sick?  So much for enjoying my off day. Had a great nap though.
934 2018-10-29 21:53:46 Splashed some oil in Lamela’s eyes
935 2018-10-29 21:53:41 I have a new favourite art medium....OIL PAINTS!!!!!!! I actually love them. First attempt will be posted on #instagram tomorrow.

My right hand got burned by hot oil.
937 2018-10-29 21:53:25 @SenSchumer you fear mongering LIAR. Still using  50 yr old FAILED Democratic playbook.  No wonder u need a fresh batch of cradle to grave voters to buy your snake oil. The US Treasury has taken in surplus thanks to tax breaks, job growth.  #WalkAwayFromDems

939 2018-10-29 21:52:51 Maybe many journalists should explore the New-Energy Oil&Gas News from world in Tech-Rising that enthusiastic I retweeted few minutes ago
940 2018-10-29 21:52:50 There are soooo many things we as humans are doing to the globe that are harmful...energy for bitcoin mining is just one of them. There are a tonne of changes we need to make for a better and cleaner world! Not just one! Will it become illegal? Will oil? I doubt it!!
941 2018-10-29 21:52:47 water & oil
942 2018-10-29 21:52:46 Sauf que si 22€ par mois permettent de payer 14 litres de gas oil ( donc 1 tiers de plein..) ça ne compense pas le litre de fuel de chauffage passé de 0,7 à 0,95, soit 30% d’augmentation, ce qui pour un hiver, amene â surcoût de 800 à 1000 euros pour se chauffer ! Escrocs
943 2018-10-29 21:52:42 imagine them the next morning, I took off my costume and they're like someone was trying to sell me snake oil in the night with a creepy mask
944 2018-10-29 21:52:21 My Nan was from New Mexico. Love that cuisine; corn tortillas briefly turned in a small amount of oil to soften and warm. And the peppers! Christmas!
945 2018-10-29 21:52:00 Olive oil
946 2018-10-29 21:51:48 Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world .... it also happens to have the biggest concentration of US military forces around its border ... but they tell me it’s Venezuela that’s the bad guy ....

952 2018-10-29 21:51:16 Is there anyone out there that believes this televangelist? Snake oil salesmen and used car salesmen can’t compete with this liar#. #onpoli
953 2018-10-29 21:51:10 Gas and Oil are currently charging the same as nuclear and renewable where I live, so that is false.
954 2018-10-29 21:50:49 j’ai du bio oil dans les yeux ça pique trop 
955 2018-10-29 21:50:19 dudes be like "yeah animal abuse is bad but i like to eat meat" and "i get that palm oil destroys the rain forest but oreos be hittin you know"
956 2018-10-29 21:49:36 Meanwhile we have the biggest thief and snake oil salesman in the White House! And that’s a fact no lie unlike trump who lies all day every day
957 2018-10-29 21:49:29 * Canadian dollar dips 0.2 percent against the greenback
    * Price of U.S. oil falls 0.8 percent
    * Bond prices trade mixed across the yield curve
    * Canada-U.S. 2-year spread widens by 1.4 basis points

959 2018-10-29 21:48:57 Ranking:

2. McDonald’s fries (b/c of beef tallow flavoring in the oil)
3. Beef flavored monster munch
4. Salt & Vinegar chipsticks
5. Rib eye
960 2018-10-29 21:48:52 A pure THCa crystal that formed from sauce or isolated from the oil during extraction. Think of a sugar crystal but weed lol and it's all THCa in it's purest form
961 2018-10-29 21:48:36 70kw running a bore pump and presurising water to 2 centre pivots! Engine is a bit bulky but looks bigger with all the guards to air oil the motor, hence no radiator at front
962 2018-10-29 21:48:22 oil me up, let's fight
963 2018-10-29 21:48:18 No not knackered, but the 885 in use has a habit of bending push rods and blowing oil seals, repair bills starting to build up! 
964 2018-10-29 21:48:09 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
965 2018-10-29 21:48:06 All I do is put vitamin e oil on it !!!
966 2018-10-29 21:48:02 Used to be a bonding experience for a son to learn how to change his oil from his father. Or whatever retrospective take you’d like to put on that, moms with daughters and makeup, whatever. But now kids use google and YouTube.
967 2018-10-29 21:48:02 Y'all wanna tell me why I found an olive oil label in my wallet the day after Halloweekend?

So say all of us
So say all of us.... Hurray
969 2018-10-29 21:47:46 Yeah man. We need big balled leaders if we will remove Nicolas Maduro from power in Venezuela.

And then we can split the oil of course.
970 2018-10-29 21:47:46 Need to start from the ground root level.  A big part of the economy is based on automotive and oil industry.  Perhaps the incentive should go to Auto manufacturers to start building EVs.

The gas savings alone should be incentive enough for consumers...EV will be my next car.
971 2018-10-29 21:47:44 Bruh your hair need a bit of coconut oil !

976 2018-10-29 21:46:38 Idiots
We’ve had troops in Iraq & Afghanistan to protect their citizens. Um, because we love the oil in the region.
We could protect the citizens in Honduras & Guatemala. Um, nah, nothing to offer us.
How humanitarian of us.

981 2018-10-29 21:46:13 With my year 4 class today after watching Rang Tan palm oil video...
Me: So what can we do about this?
Child: we could write to parliament so they can fix it...or we could execute the men cutting down the trees?
Me: Um...maybe we'll start with that letter. 
982 2018-10-29 21:46:05 @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna some great Canadian oil/gas companies look like they are headed for bankruptcy. So sad to see this industry destroyed and not replaced by anything more than a token renewable industry. Canada wasted it's opportunity. Others (US) have not.
983 2018-10-29 21:46:04 Speaking as an old white woman there isn’t enough oil in the store to keep me from flaking. I won’t even need cremation.
984 2018-10-29 21:45:52 So why the fuck is my oil cap $66
985 2018-10-29 21:45:48 Serious adulting on my day off: did laundry, returned some clothes, got an oil change, went to Target & got a flu shot, put my new storage unit together, sang Happy Birthday to the little girl, and now putting away these cds of mine. Damn...its not even 6pm.
986 2018-10-29 21:45:43 ive become cheap and eco friendly. thats what i love about long boarding apart from the extraction of oil used in wheels but that tiny in comparable t o a motorbike or a car. the rest of my time on on my bicycle. so transport is cheap i refuse public transport it wontkeepmealive.
987 2018-10-29 21:45:34 Why is it that the oil rig I'm on is decorated for Halloween better than most places in my hometown
988 2018-10-29 21:45:19 Se reafirma la corrección técnica y la utilidad como referencia, que tienen los PPI que calcula mensualmente la URSEA. En cuanto a la “brecha” entre precios y PPI, se emparejó porcentualmente la de naftas y gas oil luego del último aumento de combustibles resuelto por el gobierno
989 2018-10-29 21:45:05 最近寒いなって思ってたけど二桁ないんだもんね、、無理
990 2018-10-29 21:44:41 I have a coworker whose son suffers from chronic seizures...like seizures every few minutes type shit. I put him on to CBD oil which he says has basically gone a long way towards helping his son...
991 2018-10-29 21:44:30 "arthur go steal an oil wagon"
doesn't do it for 10 minutes
"dont worry we took care of it, asshole"
992 2018-10-29 21:44:30 We have two extra rooms in North Dakota I could quickly clean out. No one will find you in the oil fields. (Or even want to look tbh)
993 2018-10-29 21:44:28 Which ever way you look at it, it affects us either positively or negatively. If you apply for a job in an oil and gas firm, what do you think the requirements will be? Then compare with someone without the requirements and knowledge to oversee NNPC and over 190m people?
994 2018-10-29 21:44:25 Olive oil is the best! Nourishes your hair greatly and gives it energetic volume!
995 2018-10-29 21:44:25 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

997 2018-10-29 21:44:01 OH: CEO is on a jet ski, the company is on the oil tanker and HR is being dragged along behind in a dinghy
998 2018-10-29 21:43:55 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
999 2018-10-29 21:43:55 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1000 2018-10-29 21:43:51 寒いしんどい寒い冬来ないでほしい
1001 2018-10-29 21:43:44  Pizza topped with tomato sauce, fennel, olive oil, and pineapple.
1002 2018-10-29 21:43:42 Coconut oil works on my son's lips.
1003 2018-10-29 21:43:37 Also, because combustion engines are only ~30% efficient, and electric car motors are ~90% efficient, it's apparently the case that we could burn the oil in a power plant to make electricity to power all the cars, and still use less oil than we currently do to fuel all the cars.
1004 2018-10-29 21:43:14 That's true.not just you but most people who still like that guy,they like him for his spending of Libyan's oil.
1005 2018-10-29 21:43:01 指が死んでる
1006 2018-10-29 21:42:59 and this in an oil rich state
1007 2018-10-29 21:42:56 あﾞーーーーーーーーー！！さむい
1008 2018-10-29 21:42:53 studies confirm that that once DonaldTrump issues alternative facts, a tibetan monch whistles the #starspangledbanner
1009 2018-10-29 21:42:42 There is no deception, and most Albertans know it.  Only political partisans who have something to gain will say differently.  The world is NOT moving on from dirty oil.  That's your pipe dream and not reality.  Not over taxed?  Why are gasoline prices so high?  Carbon taxes?
1010 2018-10-29 21:42:36 New oil i got for my dab pen is mucho@calente
1011 2018-10-29 21:42:33 You lose your phone, its like losing part of you. Nothing is finished, everything needs an update. Nothing is built to last anymore, unless you pay big money. Man, you can't even do oil changes on many new cars anymore, let alone basic maintenance. We live in a society that we
1012 2018-10-29 21:42:27 Thanks for the offer but I’m Keto. I can’t have any sugar, canola oil, oats, or rice flour. Let me know when if you all ever create something Keto!
1013 2018-10-29 21:42:19 SOPHIE - Not Okay - OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES - MSMSMSM/Future Classic
1014 2018-10-29 21:42:03 If you do Cosequin go the small $ extra and buy Cosequin ASU (avocado/soybean unsaponifiables) show very good research results, also has MSM. Lots of fish oil too. Omega3 fatty acids are anti-arthritic.
1015 2018-10-29 21:41:43 The oil
1016 2018-10-29 21:41:35 Will sit back and watch till 2019, Will Buy oil stocks only if they go down to a level I am comfortable with and 6 percent DIV BP and RDSA!
1017 2018-10-29 21:41:30 Sagot ko oil pastel
1018 2018-10-29 21:41:23 Cool cool cool. Just wanted to get my oil change today but guess I'm replacing my tires too. Just knock it all out in one day. My like..November of 1200 miles of driving is appreciative of this plan.
1019 2018-10-29 21:41:19 Australia has specialised - we produce nothing but houses which we sell with a free passport and mining holes in the ground.
We've given up our manufacturing industries and all our oil refineries - we're not the slightest bit fragile.

1020 2018-10-29 21:41:19 That’s just few of my observation there are multiple other reason too (like US is an oil importing nations).
1021 2018-10-29 21:41:19 I love simple shit like oil changes now
1022 2018-10-29 21:40:47 The way Katsina girls like guys with cars, you will think they were breastfed with engine oil
1023 2018-10-29 21:40:33 The least you could do after the Brexit-related loss of value of the £ against the $ (in which oil is traded) has made fuel massively more expensive.
1024 2018-10-29 21:40:28 ナルルちゃーん、俺の机ちょっと片付けて…くれないよねー
1025 2018-10-29 21:40:15 Remembering when my friend used olive oil to have anal and told me how bad of an idea it was. I miss my friends.
1026 2018-10-29 21:40:10 今日午後からゲリラサラダ油来るらしいよ。
1027 2018-10-29 21:40:02 Excuse me sir, have you any snake oil for sale?
1028 2018-10-29 21:39:50 We don't know each other but I'm really sorry to read about your situation. Have you tried cannabis oil? One of my cousins had these severe trigeminal migraines, she was even considering having surgery to stop the pain. Cannabis Oil helped her a lot.
1029 2018-10-29 21:39:48 I, too, am extremely irritated to discover that the obnoxious “no blood for oil” hippies were actually possibly right all along BUT YOU WILL NOT MAKE ME SWITCH TO NATURAL DEODORANT.
1030 2018-10-29 21:39:30 Americans could actually give up quite a few things before putting a dent in freedom or community.

Like oil, tantalum, diamonds, iron. But no. We send soldiers to risk their lives so we can continue making gas and phones, computers and pretty things.

America can't just hide.
1031 2018-10-29 21:39:29 I'll bet that's tasty as hell with the oil from the barrel on the bacon. What a fucking moron
1032 2018-10-29 21:39:23 Going to review the ZEN monq essential oil vape thing. We will see

1040 2018-10-29 21:38:10 Breaking News! Canadians will continue to manufacture & sell armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia! In addition, Canada will continue to import oil from the Saudi’s!  Tonight Canadians will watch hockey, smoke pot, & chat about Americans!  All is well in Canada ! @JustinTrudeau
1041 2018-10-29 21:38:06 She better get some oil and some glue remover.
1042 2018-10-29 21:38:00 Totally possible. I'm thinking of the oil change people and not people drinking Fox late night like they need it to live.
1043 2018-10-29 21:37:55 While #caudrilla are #fracking for gas in #Lancashire, #UKOG are producing #ethical #oil which gushes up from the ground under its own pressure in #Surrey near  #Gatwick with no fracking required. Question: As a UK consumer where would you prefer the UK obtain oil & gas from?
1044 2018-10-29 21:37:37 Frank incense oil
1045 2018-10-29 21:37:34 How long did you try it and what potency? If your pain levels are 7+ don't use anything less than 750mg. It took me 2.5 mos to notice pain relief!! CBD oil is most effective with consistent use.  Hope you find relief.
1046 2018-10-29 21:37:26 すげぇ。。。風邪ひいてるから早く寝たらこんな時間。。。。。。
1047 2018-10-29 21:37:21 Cc: @IBM @CocaCola @Siemens Standard Oil, @ford, @GM, @Kodak, and so many other major corporations were actively investing in, and working with the nazis. 

Maybe we're wrong. major corporations *arent* capitalist. Capitalists are just the fascist friends we made along the way
1048 2018-10-29 21:37:08 Not beyond “national security” meaning grand ol’ gains for their Raytheon and Gulf Oil stock.
1049 2018-10-29 21:37:08 is that some kind of practical skin treatment thing I'm unaware of, or did he just find a 45 y/o bottle of linseed oil and think "time to fuck with my co-workers?"
1050 2018-10-29 21:37:03 My bf said my hair is shiny, that hot oil treatment was magical yesterday
1051 2018-10-29 21:37:02 Student: I was really busy with work so I couldn’t do my homework

Teacher: That’s not an excuse, you need to make time for it. 

Student: Do we get our tests back today? 

Teacher: No, my car needed an oil change. I’ll have them next week.
1052 2018-10-29 21:36:54 $1= #200 PDP govts

@PMB

Average price $70
2,200,000×70×360) = #55, 440, 000 000

Why is APC govt always peddling lies and falsehood?
1053 2018-10-29 21:36:54 Saudi Arabia isn't exactly a liberal paradise, so money and oil clearly play a large role which leads me back to point of why Israel is so important. If a big part of a close US relationships is money and power projection why isn't there an "israel" of South America or...
1054 2018-10-29 21:36:41 Goldiggers dig until they find oil
1055 2018-10-29 21:36:18 It’s 8.30am here and i almost spit out my oil pull
1056 2018-10-29 21:36:04 Didn't Syria get invaded by the west for Thier use of chemical weapons oh and the fact they had oil and didn't have the Rothschild's running the banks
1057 2018-10-29 21:36:00 The German oil and additive specialist Liqui Moly will be the main sponsor of the Four Hills Tournament in Germany and Austria, a major ski jumping competition.  @LiquiMolyUSA
1058 2018-10-29 21:35:59 This isn't THE takeaway I know... but I can't help thinking of ALL the wasted jet fuel carrying his large backside all over the States. At a time when emissions are a problem we're trying to reduce and we're acutely aware that oil is a finite resource, Trump wasting it on THIS...
1059 2018-10-29 21:35:56 Best breakfast: I eat a salad with either hard boiled eggs or meat on it, olive oil, and organic raw apple cider vinegar each morning. 

(Ducks rotten tomatoes about to be thrown at me...)
1060 2018-10-29 21:35:49 They care about the Union you Muppet because we are stronger together. Are you too blind to see that we can't afford to go it alone. What oil? It's going to cost billions to decommission the fields because there is no money in them. Who's going to pay for that?
1061 2018-10-29 21:35:27 Wrong liberal dribble. The division started LONG AGO. When the left/media chanted "Selected Not Elected" & continued with "No blood for oil"& "Bush lied, people died" & blaming Bush for Katrine & SO MUCH MORE. 8 years of having your way seems to have erased your memory.
1062 2018-10-29 21:35:19 Any good pure CBD hemp oil or tincture will be more expensive. But prevention is definitely cheaper than a cure. And I'm paying almost the same price for our CBD oil as some of our Prescriptions with insurance!!
1063 2018-10-29 21:35:16 6 drops of tea tree oil in a spray bottle..I spray everything that comes home from school then put drops in parks shampoo bottle. We’ve had no issues 
1064 2018-10-29 21:35:11 Get a life loser

1069 2018-10-29 21:34:46 so I putted some tea tree oil on a pimple and after that i had to say something to my mum and i walked up to her and she said "have you used chlorine" aND THE SERIOUS FUCK I AM STARTED DANCING AND SINGING "SipPING ON STRAIGHT CHLORINE LET THE VIBES SLIDE OVER ME..."

1071 2018-10-29 21:34:38 Yes, I am ashamed of my British Gvnt who blindly continue to follow the US Pentagon into illigal, civilian slaughtering wars for oil & arms deals.
1072 2018-10-29 21:34:32 Same. I have to used lotion and coconut oil or my skin gets ridiculously dry, then it cracks and bleeds. Sometimes even the lotion doesn’t help.
1073 2018-10-29 21:34:28 @Plaid_Pompeo the revolutionary guards are seeking ways to go around sanctions and use many domestic and foreign companies to sellIranian oil.

1079 2018-10-29 21:34:11 But Ian it’s worth remembering that Chancellors have a tendency to announce taxes on industries when they’ve reached peaked profits. Like Oil Co’s, Banks, and Telecoms before. A sign to sell ?
1080 2018-10-29 21:34:10 Not happening.  Remember the oil industry ? Sturgeon sat on her hands demanding that Westminster acted.
1081 2018-10-29 21:33:59 When you get home/to a chemist, get lavender oil and gauze. Put a few drops of the oil in a bowl of cold water, soak your hand. Then mix a few drops of the oil with coconut/olive oil (it's a bit strong so you need to dilute it) and dab it on the burn. Cover it with gauze then.
1082 2018-10-29 21:33:57 2ltr cooking oil  at  10$  loaf of bread  at  1.20$ ,   i panic for  sure!!!

1092 2018-10-29 21:33:12 "Inventory gain or loss is the difference between the price at which a company buys crude oil and the price at which fuel is sold." is not right. Pls correct.

1094 2018-10-29 21:32:40 I hate coming to get oil changes this shit takes wayyyyyu to long.
1095 2018-10-29 21:32:38 Yet we provide subsidies to oil industry To a proportion totLly unfair to subsidies for EV . Can cnn cover this major issue ? When will you do a reportage about pollution here in USA ?
1096 2018-10-29 21:32:31 They implemented this during the Carter administration w/high oil prices. Why hasn’t it been removed?!

1106 2018-10-29 21:30:57 Being an Open-Borders Globalist defines oneself as Anti-American.

You want to tax us more, trade with slave labor nations who hardly adhere to Democrat standards on US Soil, and want more CIA/FBI Oil Wars.

Go back to your hole and don't come out.

All I will ask you is that from what source do you think Naija gets it Revenue from? 
You said dollars at 185 previous administration,Did you ask your self how much oil was selling per barrel then and ask how much it is selling now
If you don’t know

1117 2018-10-29 21:30:13 “There will still be plenty of jobs in the field and won’t actually hurt the industry in Colorado.” You made that up entirely and try to pass it off as fact.  Oil companies and the jobs will vanish immediately. Happened in ‘08 here. You still lived in CA then.
1118 2018-10-29 21:30:10 And how much are you charging Saudi Arabia for the oil they sell us? Why are you only subjecting Canadians to this crippling tax that has no benifits to the environment?

1121 2018-10-29 21:29:29 The dollar-cost averaging tactics that oil companies use daily, hourly, in lock-step with each other...why is that never investigated? @GasBuddyDan ? Artificial profits that have no correlation to oil prices? It’s a joke. Waiting for the next excuse du jour.

1130 2018-10-29 21:28:42 OBSESSED please do a video or post (on ig lol i follow u there too) on how you did this. I want to oil paint but have no guidance whatsoever
1131 2018-10-29 21:28:39 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
1132 2018-10-29 21:28:39 The problem is my species doesn't have 100% defined facts.... But I try!

Fire breath functions similarly to a flamethrower, with a fuel reservoir produced as a biological bi-product and a spark produced by a clicking of special molars. Vomiting burning oil basically

1139 2018-10-29 21:27:05 Hey Melanie, for some of our Keto friends, you're right. Sunflower oil can be difficult to navigate. For others, however, it offers a great alternative... These (we feel confident in saying) are the best tasting pork rinds around

1152 2018-10-29 21:25:36 Hey Rachel, great story on reducing spoilage. Would have been much better is you left the fear rhetoric out of the piece. Chemistry isn't bad, it's actually at the root of why the product works. Oh, the "chemical-free" powder is made from lipid-rich oil. You know, chemicals!
1153 2018-10-29 21:25:30 every oil change they lecture me on car maintenance and i just let them

1160 2018-10-29 21:24:38 The LEAP manifesto isn't just about Oil, Pipelines, and the Environment. It also has points on Food Security and Poverty Reduction. I'm not a fan of large parts of the manifesto but it isn't entirely without value.

1162 2018-10-29 21:24:35 FYI FDR was the 1st President to promise Saudi Arabia unlimited protection in exchange for oil.
1163 2018-10-29 21:24:30 I think the geological risks are slight, especially in comparison to oil extraction from difficult places like the wondrous work in the North Sea.

The issue is more fundamental, is Carbon-energy the future?

1167 2018-10-29 21:23:59 Beto voted for a 10 dollar tax per barrel of oil. Unless you want to pay 5 bucks for a gallon of gas, I suggest you think about that for a minute...
1168 2018-10-29 21:23:58 Commodities: #Rice -3.12%, #Orange Juice +2.43%
Top commodity losers are Rice (-3.12%), Sugar (-1.45%) and Rubber (-1.08%). Gains are led by Orange Juice (2.43%), Canola (1.93%) and Palm Oil (1.42%).
1169 2018-10-29 21:23:52 It’s making money for arms dealers, oil companies, and private prison companies. I imagine they’re fine with it.

This costume had me dying tho omg, when it popped up as first post on my feed I was in fucking tears.
1173 2018-10-29 21:23:46 CBD oil helps more than I thought it would tbh
1174 2018-10-29 21:23:45 I once saw a pic shared on FB taken on a trades mans home cctv system of a suspect car in around his yard. It’s 20 miles from where I live in a rural area and guess what? It was a local traveller lad that’s notorious for stealing home heating oil and tools!!
1175 2018-10-29 21:23:41 a law unto themselves with help of masses of wealth and influence spread everywhere!  Imagine the west went elsewhere for the oil!
1176 2018-10-29 21:23:38 it is odd considering all the tankers going out for #ukog ...await the RNS I guess.

1182 2018-10-29 21:22:59 The right is retaking in power, but as Maduro governs Venezuela there will be chaos in neighboring countries because Venezuela Russia and China want the Backyard of America, the area has no value but has a lot of oil and they would be manipulating the continent in Against the US

1188 2018-10-29 21:22:05 You where talking about fish oil being oxidized. Youngevity packages their EfA under a  nitrogen gas system to keep the oil from oxidizing.
1189 2018-10-29 21:22:00 My people were victims of the Biafran war. South Easterners were selfish and wanted separation because they found oil on their land. They killed not only “enemies” but also their own. Both their leaders were cowards who ran each time and left their people to suffer consequences.

1196 2018-10-29 21:21:13 Yep. A trick I use is applying baby oil in the shower with a washcloth. When you get out, don’t dry off. Immediately apply lotion on top. I do that like every other day or so in the winter.

1203 2018-10-29 21:20:07 pretty sure small cap accounts are  trying to get attention by leaving negative comments. Because they know your acc is much appreciated in the crypto scene and those negative comments will get higlighted. It´s like a oil drops diffuse in the water. negative attracts negative..

1208 2018-10-29 21:19:46 The economy is not limping along, although the oil and gas industry may be suffering as the world moves on from dirty oil. We are not over taxed, Albertans are taxed among the lowest in the western world. Please stop deceiving people.
1209 2018-10-29 21:19:07 You should add honey for extra moisture. It's very good for the skin. Gives the skin an extra shine. Just a few drops of honey and a few drops of coconut /olive oil.
1210 2018-10-29 21:19:07 No, m'm. You just don't want to know the ugly truth: behind every wind and solar plant, operating ca. 25% of the time, there is a coal or oil plant working the rest of the time. It is not difficult to check this in the net, but you don't want to know it. That makes you like Trump

1215 2018-10-29 21:18:37 There are so many ways to generate power but no here in Canada we stick with oil. Let's start the Hippies Revival Party, make Love not wars and completely outlaw all forms of corporate lobbying, for starters.
1216 2018-10-29 21:18:33 We thought we got everything out of the trunk, but alas, we forgot the opened bottle of olive oil, the entire contents of which spilled all over the trunk. Our car smells like a Greek restaurant now.

1220 2018-10-29 21:17:33 Great to see support for carbon taxes. We could add to that a rollback of oil industry subsidies that have been grandfathered for the past 100 years. Use that money for clean energy transition.

1228 2018-10-29 21:17:04 Try using rubbing alcohol to detoxify your pores twice a week. You can put alcohol into a mini spray bottle with a few drops of a essential oil scent you like (if you’re into that) and it’ll help unclog your pores which will can help with perspiring and odor.
1229 2018-10-29 21:17:02 Shell has made investments in hydrogen, and convinced CA and Germany to follow suit. I'm worried that hydrogen is the wrong horse in this race, but the fact that an oil company is even on a horse, riding in the same direction, and encouraging others to do the same is huge.

1234 2018-10-29 21:16:11 There are other reasons to slow down on oil consumption, particularly gasoline.  Even though we have new methods of extraction, there is a limited supply.  There are temporary substitutes such as natural gas until such time as we have viable alternatives.  EV's are not there yet.

1243 2018-10-29 21:14:57 Thats a weighty sum, I agree. Do we know the terms? Favourable maybe? Generations unborn in debt, perhaps. Our debt to GDP is still low, though GDP is mainly oil based (wahala) Issue lies in trickle or flow down

1248 2018-10-29 21:14:30 Oil diffusers sound amazing
1249 2018-10-29 21:14:23 Fortunately not all humanity is irresponsible. Africans have always shown respect for nature. We go around a  whilst Westerners dynamite. We  for the day, Westerners industrial fish with oil leaks. Africans fetch food fr bushes, they deforestate. Act surprised #GlobalWarming

1252 2018-10-29 21:13:55 They don’t really need a lot of water. I’ve got 1 larger tree and over  the years I’ve come to know when they need a drink #plantwhisper #greenfingerd
1253 2018-10-29 21:13:49 I don't think u can oil a mikano oooo
1254 2018-10-29 21:13:38 I saw some castor oil in the bathroom.  Uh oh, someone needs to get moving down there lol.  It's for weed as well so there is that.

1256 2018-10-29 21:13:21 I added Jamaican castor oil and this scalp treatment and maaaan my head doesn’t itch at all now
1257 2018-10-29 21:13:15 I don’t like the realistic game precedent that Red Dead 2 is setting. I have to clean my horse? I can lose my hat? I have to put oil on my guns? For fucks sake at this rate Rockstar’s gonna make me charge my phone and piss every 2 hours in GTA 6
1258 2018-10-29 21:12:54 1 an oil poil qu’on c’est pas vu avec Clara 
1259 2018-10-29 21:12:31 Hold on sweet cakes..... some of us whities know the pitfalls of ashy skin and super dryness.  I gotta use tons of coconut oil and any oil I can get my hands on for hair, and in the winter, the skin is flaky — not just chalky - but falling off flaky.  I feel ya’ and it suks!
1260 2018-10-29 21:12:28 It is a criminal offence but a completely preventable one by the oil companies!
1261 2018-10-29 21:12:25 Not sure how the NDP are kissing up to so called big oil when they've done everything to ensure nothing gets built.
1262 2018-10-29 21:12:23 Why Saudi Arabia gets away with anything:

-Trade oil on the dollar.
-Has the largest crude oil production capacity and second largest oil reserves in the world.
-Claims to be custodians to Mecca.
-Has exported Wahhabism (Islamic extremism) all over the world.
-Large arms deals.
1263 2018-10-29 21:12:22 Yeah, Trump has been leading the pitchfork mob mentality since he decided to run for the presidency.  It's fools like you who think he's not selling snake oil and stoking fears and racism and divisions in this country.  Fools like you are destroying the republic.
1264 2018-10-29 21:12:08 I think I need anointing oil
1265 2018-10-29 21:12:01 Oil change tire rotation
1266 2018-10-29 21:11:58 That’s awesome! Let him know Oil Country is behind him!
1267 2018-10-29 21:11:51 Fresh oil change with a full tank of gas >>>
1268 2018-10-29 21:11:39 Line in the sand is quite apt really the way trees are being cut down to supply you with palm oil that’s what the rain forests will become ‘deserts’
1269 2018-10-29 21:11:39 Sprinkle palm oil with ugu leaf on her then say after me:
"Kepa Aribisala ablaga"
1270 2018-10-29 21:11:36 True.
Side note:
That FOX "news" report you showed on Patreon stories infuriated me. Got me thinking that foxes (animal) are sneaky beasts and the name suits the corporation rather perfectly. Snake oil selling foxes...
1271 2018-10-29 21:11:34 your struggle oil boss and beneficiary evil people
1272 2018-10-29 21:11:30 I must be honest, I was more impressed with that Moroccan Oil behind you, I couldn't even tell you what color that car is. 
But when you do end up in Morroco I'm sure I'll be there with you sitting on a pile of drugs and dead hookers. A girl can dream.
1273 2018-10-29 21:11:30 My dad took up oil painting after he retired because of Bob Ross. He really enjoyed it. Those happy little tree's

1275 2018-10-29 21:11:18 Your information is incorrect.
King Abdul Aziz just did what he did to establish relations with Britain and his time was a very poor country of Saudi Arabia did not discover oil at the time.
And historic war between (first and second Saudi country ) against the Ottoman Empire
1276 2018-10-29 21:11:15 Am Horny
Am Hungry

This feeling is funny, but if Yu can put it on me I will oil your generator 
1277 2018-10-29 21:11:08 Onside Kane flagged off by oil money clean through
1278 2018-10-29 21:10:58 Might even be two for me  I need parts again, their oil will have you smelling good all day
1279 2018-10-29 21:10:49 I remember the dinosaurs having the same convo, nobody believed the mammoths? And look what happened, revenge is oil ( dead dinosaurs) if you don’t believe me or say I am a climate loon like the others.
1280 2018-10-29 21:10:48 @ErinDixonWMTW Tremendous report Erin. Not too surprised that folks are turning to firewood as oil/propane/electrical and other sources of heating is starting to get out of sight.
Winter may be harsh and I'm thinking of the less fortunate folks.
1281 2018-10-29 21:10:48 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!
1282 2018-10-29 21:10:39 Money for counter-terrorism? No increase in Police numbers or spending.
Boost for schools? Spending per pupil down
More homes? Council Houses and Social Housing. No
Help for the environment? £30bn subsidy for oil & gas producers. Yes
1283 2018-10-29 21:10:34 Fun fact from Brexistan : the judge who jailed 3 dudes for protesting fracking is a direct descendant of a judge who sentenced witches to death 400 years ago (and has family interests in oil & gas, naturally).  #resist
1284 2018-10-29 21:10:29 The test for radioactivity is also how they distinguish "green" ethanol from ethanol made from oil. Depending on market forces and the law (depends on state and time), they might check your fuel ethanol for radioactivity before giving you the money.
1285 2018-10-29 21:10:27 It's kinda of funny oh, the indomie I prepare in surulere tastes different from the one I prepare in okota, same frypan same Cameroon pepper,same g.nut oil egg etc, same ingredients oh, I keep wondering why it tastes different

1287 2018-10-29 21:10:03 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
1288 2018-10-29 21:09:57 You do not sound very "loyal". Do you work for big oil?
1289 2018-10-29 21:09:51 四暗刻さんおはありです！
1290 2018-10-29 21:09:45 How do oil producers pay the royalty in barrels of oil? What does Alberta's Gov do with the oil at that point? #OOTT
1291 2018-10-29 21:09:27 *huffs tea tree oil like poppers* ahh the vegan life
1292 2018-10-29 21:09:23 Alaskans own 852,600 shares of MEDCO ENERGI INTERNASIONAL TBK, worth $223,939. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in INDONESIA.
1293 2018-10-29 21:09:12 I don't think Jonathan has the faintest idea about Zahawi's dreadful oil industry track record, nor his interference in foreign referendums. He's more of a 3 wise monkey type. He's hanging onto the coat tails of a guy who hangs onto the wrong coat tails. Oops
1294 2018-10-29 21:09:05 Republicans all have jacked up teeth because they’d rather by an excessive amount of oil than get a root canal taken care of
1295 2018-10-29 21:08:58 Turns out I was an executive at an ethanol company. US law requires that alcoholic drinks be made by fermentation. The standard test for this is radioactivity C-14. Plants are radioactive so alcohol made from them is also radioactive. If you make alcohol from oil it is not.
1296 2018-10-29 21:08:53 I like the big ones minced up really fine. With just a little oil and vinegar
1297 2018-10-29 21:08:32 Palm oil
1298 2018-10-29 21:08:26 I went to go get an oil change and my dad(who's not here) told me to start an argument with the mechanics and tell them to put the drained oil back in my car
1299 2018-10-29 21:08:25 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
1300 2018-10-29 21:08:17 In turn I can also nominate @ljmabon who is working right at the oil face in Aberdeen.
1301 2018-10-29 21:08:05 The falling ratio of C14 in the atmosphere proves the rising concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is caused by burning coal and oil. (C14 is lowest in long-buried carbon.)
1302 2018-10-29 21:08:02 I was very pleased about potholes in the budget but not sure 
about 8p on my bottle of wine.
1303 2018-10-29 21:07:56 Vermont biotech has finally arrived in the road in our 35th week with oil prices?
1304 2018-10-29 21:07:55 @billmaher you know the US created terriost. Back in 76-79 ish when American troops protected the kings oil in saudi. And shortly after his rules took over covering women like in the book. That pissed people off US was sitting there so who else to get mad at. “Lord of war” clip
1305 2018-10-29 21:07:52 If mkts lose another 10-15% between now and Dec meeting it will stop Powell in his tracks. Oil will be 10 bucks lower in that situation and there will be no inflation to defend against. At some point raising rates to have the ability to lower them in a crisis will cause a crisis.
1306 2018-10-29 21:07:35 Anointing oil is not for sale he is jus doing this for everyone those especially non believers and he does not money from anyone
1307 2018-10-29 21:07:19 Not only dirty, but bloody also.  Seems Justin believes the world is better off buying foreign blood oil rather than ethically produced Canadian oil.
1308 2018-10-29 21:07:13 I know, I know the answer!! Wait who was the country long embroiled in the Middle Easts Oil Grabbing Warfare? Oh yeah, US ...
Imagine the Africa we'd be fighting over if US & Russia, cared more about diamonds??
1309 2018-10-29 21:07:10 Its an African neighborhood in south west Philly i get my oil change over there
1310 2018-10-29 21:07:10 We give foil wrapped chocolate coins from Sainsbury's, which are also palm oil free. But I'm not sure if foil any better than plastic. It's all such a minefield... I like the idea of little chocolate covered cornflake cakes.
1311 2018-10-29 21:07:06 I hate how an oil change for my car is 80$
1312 2018-10-29 21:06:56 Why do we need alternate sources of energy?  The ones we have work pretty well.  Unless it’s to reduce our dependence on mid-East oil which I am all for.
1313 2018-10-29 21:06:56 This invictus perfume oil ! I love it 
1314 2018-10-29 21:06:55 Lopetugui got sacked by Spanish National team cos of Madrid. Madrid sacks him in a matter of months. Pot of beans life
1315 2018-10-29 21:06:42 Actually the scientists that worked on the IPCC reports on climate change are all volunteers. If you're looking for paid scientists, look for the people who say that oil and coal are not so bad
1316 2018-10-29 21:06:39 Some credit for this goes to President Trump for his deal on Russia oil ending hers I think.
1317 2018-10-29 21:06:25 残念ながら、時代に逆行し、昔以上に家族経営感を強めていますね。
若手はかなりうんざりしてますが、、、新聞読みにくるだけで、1700万は普通にいます。

商社の経営者の頭で、ステークホルダーの順位は、未だに従業員＞レンダー（格付け対応）＞株主ですね。そら、株もあがらないわ。
1318 2018-10-29 21:06:09 Messrs Pearson and Sons have been appointed to act on behalf of the Government and not as sole agents in the United Kingdom to prospect and bore for oil in certain areas of Great Britain.
1319 2018-10-29 21:06:05 Have you tried coconut oil? Chapstick doesnt work for me
1320 2018-10-29 21:06:03 Ford was not an engineer. Ford was a social signaler. The fact that BP is in favor of fossil fuel taxes does not bode well. On the other hand opposition to I-1639 does bode well. What was the oil company reception to Canada’s measure, or is Canada morally hazardous bc of Trudeau?
1321 2018-10-29 21:05:56 OMG.  Do you even realize how many commies we have here in this country????     Some people even use olive oil as the fat to make gravy!     OLIVE OIL!!
1322 2018-10-29 21:05:48 I had to spend over 300 dollars on supplies for the whole oil painting course alone :)
1323 2018-10-29 21:05:32 I invested because the potential is Huge & it’s basically an appraisal. Which increases the COS. If they strike oil the SP will kick on from where it gets to on spud. No brainer. #UJO could hit up to 1p on Biscathorpe strike. Which is only circa £80M MC.
1324 2018-10-29 21:05:14 To keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it.

1328 2018-10-29 21:04:39 I guarantee that f using Haley was Haslams dumb idea !   Oil company owners are famous for making the stupidest hiring and firing choices in the history of mankind
1329 2018-10-29 21:04:36 Exactly. It's all about the money and oil. It wasnt Iraq it was Saudis. So why are they allies still?
1330 2018-10-29 21:04:34 No doubt, it works for oil, gas, metals, wood products, meats, why not the grains? It just hasn't been worth enough to go after until now.
1331 2018-10-29 21:04:25 Lmao nothing warm olive oil can’t fix
1332 2018-10-29 21:04:22 I need to go up to the Oil Bar in Columbus and get my favorite oil so i can smell edible again 
1333 2018-10-29 21:04:02 The brush helps a lot. It can smooth everything out pretty effectively. What oil do you use?
1334 2018-10-29 21:03:58 Hahahha sana oil mahal hahahahahahhahaa bleehhhh
1335 2018-10-29 21:03:58 girl what kinda oil you using bc Frank should not do that
1336 2018-10-29 21:03:51 Use olive oil and French your hair in it or buy hair glue remover from the hair store
1337 2018-10-29 21:03:27 Interesting, thank you. We were discussing at work the other day about CBD oil/tablets. Only one shop in the UK sells it and that's quite recent, it's still very new over here 
1338 2018-10-29 21:03:24 just come

1340 2018-10-29 21:03:15 Oh right fair enough. Try beard oil, works great.
1341 2018-10-29 21:02:40 They sell the small bottles of 2 stroke per gallon of gas. Also put the oil in the gas can first then fill it with gas. It will mix it good.  Highest octane at the station.
1342 2018-10-29 21:02:36 That is a fact.I know about @Total EginaFPSO.First oil is expected by end Dec,2018.
Game changer for oil industry is payment of $6.5b arrears thru incremental production policy.
Gas policy signed in 2016 & recently gazetted new flare fees in July,2018 are propelling investments.
1343 2018-10-29 21:02:25 1) You brought it up dumbass

2) Iraq was a country before 2001. It was no secret that the US and other countries wanted oil and drain resources

3) Hardships still exist today. Just because something happens years ago, doesn’t mean people aren’t still affected
1344 2018-10-29 21:02:08 Anthisan- it’s the best stuff ever! Also, if you can get some Avon skin so soft original dry oil spray that’s really good for keeping insects away from you xx but once you’ve been bitten Anthisan takes the heat, lump and itching away xx
1345 2018-10-29 21:01:58 @parscale paused after saying, “It’s a show”, when talking about Trump’s rallies!  Trump’s a showman, not a legit Prez.  He thinks he’s PT Barnum showing off the bearded woman, or selling snake oil.  He cons and lies his way through his daily schedule, hoping others will shield
1346 2018-10-29 21:01:56 He is far better than Buhari  who was asked about Corruption and he started talking about Oil companies what is the correlation pls bro? Tell ur Lifeless to Ji Masun pls
1347 2018-10-29 21:01:52 I dropped my car off five days ago at an auto shop for an oil change and front brake replacement. Still haven’t even gotten a call from them giving me a quote as to what the price is going to be and last time I called them they said they hadn’t even looked at it yet.
1348 2018-10-29 21:01:36 Baby oil works wonders
1349 2018-10-29 21:01:34 You boiling your head on a vat of vegetable oil will go a hell of a lot further
1350 2018-10-29 21:01:31 Oh brazil would have taken their oil reserves under government control and inflate their own prices too?

 You know that isn't socialism right? Or are you just going to keep touting what charlie kirk shits in his diapers.
1351 2018-10-29 21:01:16 Can’t help but wonder if the Koch bros, the Irvings, and Alberta lobbyists are somehow behind this. Still upsets me how the CBC didn’t see it as a conflict of interest to allow  Rex Murphy and P. Mansbridge to do paid speaking gigs for the oil industry.
1352 2018-10-29 21:01:12 And if anybody comes back and says they do their own oil changes on a Bently* then I declare them to be a Keith; meaning, "one who must NEVER be allowed to own a self driving vehicle!"
1353 2018-10-29 21:00:59 nah what makes wife material is if you glaze the pasta after it’s cooked in oil and garlic, that’s wifey for lifey shit
1354 2018-10-29 21:00:52 I take both CBD oil and THC oil. I only take the THC oil to help me sleep.

Please give me money!
1364 2018-10-29 21:00:22 the towns both grew really really quickly when the oil boom started. (it's now slowed down, which means there's quite a few nice airbnbs as people are renting out their nice houses they can no longer pay for)

1368 2018-10-29 21:00:10 October 29, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

1371 2018-10-29 21:00:06 Recently, we had a young boy who made a generator out of magaba. This week we found an HIV cure drug. A month ago, Oil was discovered in Muzarabani. A couple of years ago, a certain guy implemented a car that uses water. 

But all we did as Zimbabweans was to criticize them!
1372 2018-10-29 21:00:02 Please let's be reminded that btw 2010 - 2015, at a time avg Oil price = $100/b, Nigeria's debt increased by $28bn but our infrastructure suffered serious NEGLECT. 
However, btw 2015 -2018, our debt imcreased by $10bn, and we have REAL PROJECTS everywhere.
Spot the difference.

Spread quiet rumours in advance of the budget about an increase to oil & whisky tax, knowing all along that it wasn’t going to happen, then take the credit for standing still.
1377 2018-10-29 20:59:44 oil in my ears
1378 2018-10-29 20:59:28 they’re convenient af. I might not ever use oil to fry my food again
1379 2018-10-29 20:59:19 Someone needs to learn how monopolies are actually formed and what the antitrust laws actually are. I’ll give you a start, look up Standard Oil. Your example in this scenario does not apply. 
1380 2018-10-29 20:59:18 Yeah I was pulling a pan with chicken and potatoes I has seasoned with olive oil and herbs and just tilted it wrong and it poured down my arm
1381 2018-10-29 20:59:18 I got an oil change this morning and now my little Nissan rides like a Maserati . . .
1382 2018-10-29 20:59:16 He got the shoes tho! Every time I see @YG with hard bottoms I want to sprinkle coconut oil on the ground.
1383 2018-10-29 20:59:05 Yeah Garrett started to bend the wrench that comes with the car when we tried to get it off last night. The dealership I brought it to for an oil change can’t fix tires so I’m going to see if they can’t take it off and put on the spare so I can bring the other tire in somewhere
1384 2018-10-29 20:59:02 Then why did he boycut the Primaries?
1385 2018-10-29 20:58:52 @ErinBrockovich We seriously need you in Pascagoula, MS. Kids are dying from a rare cancer.... in clusters in the same area. I personally believe that Chevron refinery, the BP OIL SPILL, Ingalls shipbuilding yard, or Halter Marine are releasing something into our water or soil.
1386 2018-10-29 20:58:50 @BashirAhmaad @oil_shaeikh have you seen this 
1387 2018-10-29 20:58:38 Can the consumption of 90 million bpd of oil cause a mass extinction?
1388 2018-10-29 20:58:35 Texas really is a wyld ass state. We’re an open carry state, we’re big on oil and gas but women’s right are a no, weed is illegal and we no liquor stores are open on Sunday’s.
1389 2018-10-29 20:58:33 All I can say is, if I watched it in my mums house she would deffo get the anointing oil out and start laying hands on me.
1390 2018-10-29 20:58:31 I have a theory that if I water my succulent with coconut oil it will in fact become a coconut plant. Stay tuned for updates.
1391 2018-10-29 20:58:31 Comin' back to WV to sell more snake oil. 
1392 2018-10-29 20:58:27 It’s at the date OR the mileage which ever come first but you’ll be fine for a few thousand more miles. If you want it changed for free I can do it just buy the filter and the oil
1393 2018-10-29 20:58:25 Satin had been at this for a few good hours now-
In fact an entire night to be exact.

Trying to throw in the correct combination of flower petals, honey and maybe even mixing in a little oil-.
Odd ingredients, yes of course.
The last thing he needs is rose nectar!

1394 2018-10-29 20:58:23 Excellent! Thank you. Am I right in thinking that the statue is known as "Peace"? To date, I've been unable to ascertain whether Wally ever produced an oil painting from these sketches but, you never know: it may be "out there" somewhere!
1395 2018-10-29 20:58:21 “do you love the smell of teak oil in the morning?” we know cody does
1396 2018-10-29 20:58:18 I'm half with you. Rails Yes, pipelines a hard no.
Rails can be used into the future, for oil now, but pipelines built for the last 10 years or more are #StrandedAssets.
1397 2018-10-29 20:58:16 I typically use grapeseed because it’s so thin. I’ve got it in a bottle with about ten drops of oil! I also will put a few drops on a wet washcloth and freeze it, then use it on the back of my neck.
1398 2018-10-29 20:58:14 I was frying tempeh in oil, pepper, and cumin, and out of nowhere got the urge to pour some la croix into the pan - it worked
1399 2018-10-29 20:58:12 The obsession with oil money brought PMB back. Nothing else.
1400 2018-10-29 20:58:02 The anonymous mailer sent Castor Bean seeds. Despicable? Yes. To be condemned? Yes. 

In order to be affected, one must chew 6 of them up and swallow. I grow Castor Bean, FYI. Castor oil is a food additive. Peace.
1401 2018-10-29 20:57:53 They could draft Ed Oliver oil
1402 2018-10-29 20:57:49 The Raiders have re-assigned 2000-born defenceman Konrad Belcourt. He will re-join the AJHL's Fort McMurray Oil Barons.
1403 2018-10-29 20:57:45 Laundry done, oil changed, shape up all done before going to make some extra money. Productive as fuck bishhhhh
1404 2018-10-29 20:57:39 They don’t even sell palm oil in San Mo 
1405 2018-10-29 20:57:36 You should. Use palm oil for the egg stew lol. Enjoy x

1412 2018-10-29 20:56:34 i just sprayed oil sheen around my room like air freshener

1414 2018-10-29 20:56:29 Hey you call yourself progressive? How come you play for coal and oil and steel mills? If a "progressive" despise science they turn into "regressives". Next, they deny global warming... Heard of them? No? Go look into the mirror :)
1415 2018-10-29 20:56:27 One night I browned a pork tenderloin on the stovetop. Then put into 450 oven, in a metal frypan. When I thought it was done, I reached in, and picked up the pan, bare handed!! I burned the SH*T out of my hand. BUT, I wouldn't trade you! Oil hurts the absolute worst!!
1416 2018-10-29 20:56:13 Dan, 20 year herb veteran here. I’m almost fully off flower and religiously adore my FLYTE PEN. Refillable cartridges, an element that burns their oil perfectly, recharged in USB ports. PERFECTION
1417 2018-10-29 20:56:09 Some of our products are crafted from a combination of plant derived and animal derived ingredients. Additionally, palm oil is a really important issue.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
1418 2018-10-29 20:56:08 Yeah, I never got the whole blaming Jews for the world's problems. Considering the largest influencers are the Oil industry and the Military Industrial Complex; people and corporations who yield trillions of dollars of influence, but I have seen both sides do this rabidly.
1419 2018-10-29 20:55:51 Mother Teresa
If you want a love message to be heard, it has got to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it.
1420 2018-10-29 20:55:51 But the cost of exploration and exploitation of oil in the Niger Delta is inexpensive abi?
You better polish your speech.The era of ignorance is no longer existing in our region again@emmanueludunghan

1422 2018-10-29 20:55:49 Turbo oil? XD
1423 2018-10-29 20:55:32 my hero name is oil ears
1424 2018-10-29 20:55:29 Yeah. I think I put too much two stroke oil in it.
1425 2018-10-29 20:55:13 Or use some type of oil free/ matte makeup
1426 2018-10-29 20:55:10 This woman said someone's still using oil they received as a wedding gift 30 years ago. Lordt.
1427 2018-10-29 20:55:03 Like do you honestly think that racing around a kitchen constantly, getting boiling hot oil on you, and dealing with just the worst fucking customers constantly isn't hard?
1428 2018-10-29 20:54:57 @realDonaldTrump

1430 2018-10-29 20:54:40 Made a cold pressed coconut oil hair and face mask, have a Bengal spiced tea and I’m following the shenanigans of our favourite teenage witch #winter #cosy #spooktacular
1431 2018-10-29 20:54:36 Hahaha. I remember a "friend" telling me I couldn't land an internship in a big oil firm he had interned with.Not only did I land an internship, I got a full time job in that same oil firm and got promoted twice!
1432 2018-10-29 20:54:30 Pick a day that the lotus can start without jump leads, and mind you don’t slip on its oil puddle. Anyway, the Mx-5 has never been about speed, rather driving pleasure. This includes working every day for most people. Not many cars *aren’t* faster than a stock Mx-5!
1433 2018-10-29 20:54:27 1) Japan also had 6 sigma which helped their work funct. Germany still has a lot of internal conflict in their country
2) Iraq was bombed by the US over oil. Innocent ppl were killed mainly bc the US needed some
3) So what I’m American. My ancestors had their culture taken away
1434 2018-10-29 20:54:26 I love jojoba oil
1435 2018-10-29 20:54:23 See, that restores my faith in puns. You fall out of love with them, then super fish oil comes along and you're back on board.
1436 2018-10-29 20:54:10 We can let them look on at our burgeoning oil fund through reinforced glass, like Tiny Tim and his siblings looking at the Christmas toys through the toy shop winda !!
1437 2018-10-29 20:53:58 This one no be groundnot oil akara na puff puff dey dat pix
1438 2018-10-29 20:53:57 Proud?  What’s pride got to do with fighting tax on polluters?  Is  Big Oil lobbying money somehow behind this move as it is behind AGM denial websites?
1439 2018-10-29 20:53:53 Nope.  And we should keep using it until solar/wind etc are actually viable on the free market.  Oil, gas, and coal have revolutionized the living standards for the poor like no other discovery and continue to do so
1440 2018-10-29 20:53:24 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
1441 2018-10-29 20:53:18 I’ve heard black seed oil but I’m not sure if it’s vegan 100%
1442 2018-10-29 20:53:04 Learn grammar before before being a snake oil vendor.
1443 2018-10-29 20:52:54 They'll be searching for barrels of headlight oil.

1448 2018-10-29 20:51:59 you could just rub your torso in car oil for the same effect
1449 2018-10-29 20:51:36 I need some hair oil. But i dont wanna catch the train
1450 2018-10-29 20:51:32 It’s Portuguese Chorizo with Sweet Peas and I break eggs in it. Spices and Olive Oil. It’s so good. Some crusty bread to dunk in the sauce 
1451 2018-10-29 20:51:29 Because we have a couple of carts from the factory, and because they are still soaked through with oil, we have a pretty good idea of what it smelled like. The sound was probably like "WHAT?"
1452 2018-10-29 20:51:22 Next year I have to either be working at Samsung or the oil fields 
1453 2018-10-29 20:51:03 @TripleMAdelaide wasn't there a guy in Perth in early 1990's who made some sort of orbital engine that didn't need petrol who couldn't get govt backing who's engine was bought by a major oil co & shelved?

1458 2018-10-29 20:50:37 I love peppermint & lemon or peppermint & lavender, I diffuse them or use a carrier oil & apply topically
1459 2018-10-29 20:50:34 Got my car washed, oil changed, gassed up  I’m good !
1460 2018-10-29 20:50:27 So non recyclable/non decay-able/planet and oil based cup... its the worst cup ever 
1461 2018-10-29 20:50:00 And the same people who take that 92% of scots oil are the ones you believe when they say scots cant afford indy!
Talk aboot not seeing the woods for the trees
1462 2018-10-29 20:49:42 Thats one part that they had been killed to make a cup second incoveniwnt part that this cup is not self decaying and i doupt it is recyclable as it will be expensive to separate the waterproof film inside “most likely polly ethylene based i.e oil :D
1463 2018-10-29 20:49:38 I love their stuff! The vitamin c serum is a must and the face oil is awesome. I mix it with my usual moisturizer before bed and it just locks in all the moisture. I might look like a greasy mess but my skin is super soft in the morning.
1464 2018-10-29 20:49:18 Right near Lucas Oil Stadium
1465 2018-10-29 20:49:14 They need to change the oil in the frying pan for one, bacon could be crispier and they need to have a look at buying a new toaster.
1466 2018-10-29 20:49:13 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
1467 2018-10-29 20:49:11 Have you suddenly discovered that no gas and no oil is moved by sea? Correct, it’s very difficult to impose sanctions. Then the IS doesn’t have any ships for dry cargo and relies on foreign countries, very friendly to impose tariffs on their trade. Does not impress anyone!

1473 2018-10-29 20:48:42 @CarolineHydeTV is very important to note referendum in Mexico against airport it was bluntly illegal and the fact that Amlo can and will modify the constitution and remove oil contracts to private. The poll how it was done is important u aren't reporting that. Liberalism is over
1474 2018-10-29 20:48:29 Oil is steadfast in my daily routine, and no matter whether I'm faced with oily or dry skin, I will always prep my face with an oil

We have a good amount of oil + natural gas but Greece and Cyprus are stealing+government doesn’t care. Plus Suez Canal
1494 2018-10-29 20:45:17 Our global economy isn’t  a supply & demand economy. It quit being so in the early 2000’s (maybe sooner).

Labor costs (most everything besides oil) & artificial price manipulation (oil & other commodities) are what drives prices.

His statement is true from this perspective.
1495 2018-10-29 20:45:09 god knew i would be too powerful with soft hands so he gave me no oil glands on them

1507 2018-10-29 20:43:57 Playing baseball with 45,000 lives takes hubris. Good luck with that. On second thought, instead of criticizing everything wrong they do why don't you saddle up and figure out what you can do to help take us off predatory oil deals. CNBC, Bloomberg and those guys are irrelevant.

1512 2018-10-29 20:43:26 Just while we wait & see! I had an idea I might put a drop of clove oil in the milk & oil solution I make & spray 4 Black spot & mould see if that prevents rust on Snake Beans.

1515 2018-10-29 20:43:02 And why are they cutting down the forests? To plant palm oil plants. For who? Big Food and Big Cosmetics conglomerates, including ADM, Unilever, Cargill, Procter & Gamble, Nestle, Kraft and Burger King. PepsiCo too for their Doritos.
1516 2018-10-29 20:43:02 The only reason the U.S. Has never condemned Saudi Arabia, for example, is because we needed their oil and we had a myriad of business arrangements with them. Yet, the September 11 hijackers were either Saudi citizens and/or financed by Saudi Arabia.

1521 2018-10-29 20:42:28 Fracked natural gas is the number one reason we've been able to improve city air quality (by converting from oil heat) and reduce acid rain and atmospheric carbon output (by converting coal plants to gas, as well as fueling fleet vehicles). Gore is 100% wrong to try to stop it.
1522 2018-10-29 20:42:02 where is norway's loyalty to oil .. which has made them rich !
1523 2018-10-29 20:41:57 It is a great film! Would knit nicely with the Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil, which they watched a few weeks ago.
1524 2018-10-29 20:41:56 You should hedge by shorting oil?
1525 2018-10-29 20:41:56 What? Show me a few hundred tweets, several dozen rallies, or a few hundred press conferences/interviews where Bernie repeatedly called Scalise the enemy, where Pelosi called ANTIFA “fine people too” or Booker told his supporters he’ll pay their bills if they fight conservatives.
1526 2018-10-29 20:41:53 This platform is a dumpster fire in an oil refinery but it's really the only place I can be tragically depressed and not get worrying looks from people so I guess I'm stuck here.

1543 2018-10-29 20:40:00 Not that conditioner; I tried using coconut oil itself as a deep conditioner one time.
1544 2018-10-29 20:39:56 I’m far from convinced of that. There’s tons of places to get oil. Not clear there’s tons of places to get key battery components. But OP was about cost of engine not gas.

1556 2018-10-29 20:38:45 Disagree....   so Bernie is to blame for Scalise shooting?  

Waters, Booker, Pelosi and others are to blame for ANTIFA and attacks at GOP offices... another shot up last night in FL.

1563 2018-10-29 20:38:02 Those of us in the extra virgin olive oil business actually do use EVOO as shorthand sometimes - it’s a distinct grade of the oil, far different from what is sold under just the name “olive oil”.
1564 2018-10-29 20:37:47 Media has always had leaninings. This isn’t unique to Donald. He’s not the victim of some vast media conspiracy against him.

1578 2018-10-29 20:35:59 Why managers at these oil places always got an attitudev
1579 2018-10-29 20:35:49 But the government help fine tuned it in order to give enabling environment to SMEs and young entrepreneurs e.g Ford against general motors case and the breaking of the monopoly by standard oil and co.
1580 2018-10-29 20:35:33 A realistic financial crisis would be the collapse of the USD if oil producers abandon the petroleum dollar.  And I'm with you, the world will be scrambling for strategic reserve store of value and if one major economy pulls the trigger on BTC I think they all do.

1584 2018-10-29 20:35:08 A simple question we get a lot... "So, magnesium oil sounds great, how do you use it?"

1. Apply to skin
2. Rub it in

That's it! Your skin absorbs the magnesium in about 20-30 minutes to increase your overall #magnesium levels.

1625 2018-10-29 20:29:39 @jchatterleyCNN Julia, Stephen Gerlek, my BP connection said that the oil situation could have shut down the whole operation at one point. Many leaks in Alaska. He will be buying an electric car.

1628 2018-10-29 20:29:22 But that is in no small way to the Scottish economy which outstrips the UK and in turn can be attributed to huge increase in Tourism and the surge in Oil & gas price over the last 6/9 months which may not be sustainable over the coming period.

Applying caster oil nourishes your eyelashes to make them longer. It fights with the micro organisms that make your eyelashes not grow as fast.

-use a spoule (clean ) or cotton wool to apply on lashes and leave overnight and rinse off in the morning.

1649 2018-10-29 20:27:29 Men who wear jewelry really oil my engine
1650 2018-10-29 20:27:29 I'm prone to migraines, I feel your pain. I've taken headache meds and kept to dim lighting and chill ambient tunes. Tea and lavender oil help but not if you're sensitive to scents or if they trigger headaches.
1651 2018-10-29 20:27:21 CBD oil ...hope you feel better
1652 2018-10-29 20:27:07 This is weird but I promise I'm not putting you on: Try laundering the clothes with 1 can of Coca Cola and 1/4 cup of Dr. Bronner's Liquid Castile Soap. Coke takes grease out, Dr. B's takes fish oil odors out. Hand to God!
1653 2018-10-29 20:27:04 I really don’t feel like paying for this oil change Friday 
1654 2018-10-29 20:26:51 Well- Brex-Shit is doing the job for us & I may add, what a fabulous bonus it is. All those lies last time ... VOTE NO SAFEGUARD YOUR PLACE IN EU. Yup- all those dirty lies can’t be recycled this time... Oil was running out as well .. sheesh!
1655 2018-10-29 20:26:47 Just deflection on ur part
1656 2018-10-29 20:26:46 I have some moisturizer that I rarely/never use. I'll try it and jojoba oil, see if that helps.
1657 2018-10-29 20:26:45 Waiting on our oil delivery #WorcesershireHour
1658 2018-10-29 20:26:36 This reminds me to get more tea tree and clove oil
1659 2018-10-29 20:26:35 That caught next to zero traction and to be honest... I dont care where he was born as he was born to an American and is a citizen. Of US regardless... as is Romney, McCain and Cruz.

I can discuss some finer details of falsefuing docs if you like but it's really irrelevant
1660 2018-10-29 20:26:17 If #Alberta was not in a economic slump, this formula would be fair. 800 million is a lot to raise for #Calgary. Low WCS oil prices are not helping, as well as #Tmx is delayed. 

Better circumstances may have made this more possible in more prosperous times.

1661 2018-10-29 20:26:17 I got the message of orange man bad 2 years ago. If this is all you expect from press you're standards are pretty low
1662 2018-10-29 20:26:14 Nothing as relaxing or cleansing as one.  Add in some eucalyptus and campfor oil on the floor and its like a Nordic steam bath.  Helps open the airway and sinuses.
1663 2018-10-29 20:26:09 What kind of oil, why the texture so goooy
1664 2018-10-29 20:26:08 wash ur hair with apple cider vinegar and use hair mask with tea tree oil
1665 2018-10-29 20:25:59 Getting an oil change and they just asked for the “owner of the Ford Escape” and 3 of us stood up. Could we be more basic.
1666 2018-10-29 20:25:55 I will go and buy new bible and olive oil
1667 2018-10-29 20:25:40 There's a big difference between the two. Hospitals are legally obligated to provide care to the uninsured. MedX is only a "subsidy" in that it reduces the amount of free care hospitals have to provide. Oil companies don't have to pump oil even if no-one is buying.
1668 2018-10-29 20:25:37 Always a snake oil salesmen
1669 2018-10-29 20:25:13 dip rise California does have a carbon pricing system and they are one of the biggest causes of reductions.
Many other states and cities are taking action, it isn't free, their taxpayers are willing to pay. Is that happening anywhere in Canada?
The rise in oil prices has 0 to do
1670 2018-10-29 20:25:12 Psalm 23:5 
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;  You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over.
1671 2018-10-29 20:25:11 Argentina can't delimit what is claimed by the UK without an agreement or going to court. They have been threatening to take legal action against the oil companies since 2010 - and can't do anything. You have title to territory then you have title to resources.
1672 2018-10-29 20:25:08 I use mine for tons of things but especially skin care!!! I mix 1-2 drops of frankincense or lemon  in with rosehip oil as a moisturizer and use tea tree oil for acne spots. Peppermint is awesome for stomach aches and fevers too 
1673 2018-10-29 20:25:02 Hi there. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
1674 2018-10-29 20:24:59 I need Jojoba Oil.

1675 2018-10-29 20:24:52 Stew is a type of food that can be eaten with rice, yam plantain, noodles, spaghetti etc
It's prepared with groundnut oil, tomatoes, pepper, onions then various spices like curry, onga stew, and others.
1676 2018-10-29 20:24:42 Don't you mean die for the right to destroy young democratic nations, steal oil and natural resources, and then sell the land to cartel sponsored opium farmers and the reconstruction rights to the vice president's company?
1677 2018-10-29 20:24:11 These kinds of causal claims are so tiring, really. BMI as major cause of heart attacks is akin to 'fluids' as major cause of obesity.  VAT vs SAT vs ECW vs MM or SSB vs beer vs cooking oil vs tea.
1678 2018-10-29 20:24:06 Duke of Oil fucks my shit up they replacing the whole Range lol
1679 2018-10-29 20:24:00 Al Sharpton is a huckster and a fraud. I’m old enough to remember the Tawana Brawley fiasco and after it was proven that was a hoax, rather than fade into obscurity, it only emboldened Sharpton. He’s nothing but a snake oil salesmen.
1680 2018-10-29 20:23:44 COMPLETE BAN ON NON-RECYCLABLE PLASTIC'S but as we all know once the crude oil runs out we will need to find an alternative to plastic being the plastic is made from crude oil
1681 2018-10-29 20:23:39 everybody knows its Scotland's oil revenue the uk is using if its handing out cash.

1683 2018-10-29 20:23:37 Yeah what was Obama doing, using ISIS to run under the table oil and skimming off the top?
1684 2018-10-29 20:23:33 ps:  re: sore tits.. this is the best tip I ever got...  strongest primrose/starflower oil you can get, don't bother with two capsules, take six a day.  MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT OMG MASSIVE.
1685 2018-10-29 20:23:17 -2 Russia to supply the EU with oil, destroying Isis? If you’re going to be honest then you must also address the words of Dems/MSM/behaviors of Antifa and the Kavanaugh mobs that weren’t addressed, their willingness to ignore innocent till proven guilty and due process,
1686 2018-10-29 20:23:13 اللهم يكفينا شرهم
1687 2018-10-29 20:23:07 Oh, my bad. I definitely need to do better research on that. Still, I think it's a shame that we could be harvesting so much solar energy instead of oil. And I'm wary of Exxon itself; from their scepticism on climate change to the kind of political influence they can afford
1688 2018-10-29 20:23:03 You people that are retweeting for Palm oil are u alright
1689 2018-10-29 20:23:01 oil
1690 2018-10-29 20:22:59 4 brand new tires, oil change, and an alignment shits expensive but this thing runs smooth as hell.
1691 2018-10-29 20:22:47 What about a huge supply of gas and oil yet we pay big prices for gad and petrol.  Maybe it has something to do with protecting mates Ross
1692 2018-10-29 20:22:40 Let's rev up the electric car making plants then...seems reasonable, and environmentally friendly as well...the pros can crunch #'s to figure out if it's cost effective..Container ships will still need oil so there's that...shipping goods to folks around the globe is a good thing
1693 2018-10-29 20:22:29 We’re up there with renewables! Remind me again- what don’t we have that you do? WATER, OIL, GAS, WIND & WAVE POWER- the most successful tourism in the UK. Massive food exports & a healthy BIG WHISKY BOND .. Slainte.
1694 2018-10-29 20:22:12 Oil of oregano has tons of healing properties however you need the real, quality product which may be hard to find. You can try vitamin or health food stores
1695 2018-10-29 20:22:06 nah, that's lawful neutral.
had a friend use a blowtorch and a aluminium sheet once. that was pretty chaotic
smelled like motor oil, tasted like metal and we nearly died with the fumes, but hey, it was pizza
1696 2018-10-29 20:21:57 What does cbd oil taste like
1697 2018-10-29 20:21:53 If my body is like an engine then I've been filling it with moonshine and cooking oil instead of gas for the last 12 years
1698 2018-10-29 20:21:39 Getting more toward "which words"...Google has gotten better at answering even vague questions.

"what's that thing called that you use to check your oil?" 

Looking through the results can lead you to new words to try.
1699 2018-10-29 20:21:35 Peel & sautee with olive oil, small tomatoe squares, kalamata olives, lemon zest & a little juice, garlic (chopped fine), salt, pepper, dash habanero sauce optional, if you like it hot. That's it. Careful not to over cook so they stay juicy.
1700 2018-10-29 20:21:27 I thought so also, until I started using neem oil. Try it.
1701 2018-10-29 20:21:21 Because he’s a snake oil salesman con artist.
1702 2018-10-29 20:21:18 I am 25 years old. I think my penis has shrunk over the past two months. It has also titled to the left. I am unable to enjoy sex, though I do get aroused by the slightest stimulation. Is there an oil or cream that can help? I also experience pain because of kidney stones.
1703 2018-10-29 20:21:07 Keep Texas uninsured! Keep public schools crappy! Keep protecting oil and big business! Vote Cruz!

Or don’t and vote for someone that will protect you and your family.
1704 2018-10-29 20:21:03 Have you ever tried CBD oil?
1705 2018-10-29 20:20:57 @Waspapping_ similar case

NATO?increasing the GDP/increasing oil and nat gas exports/renegotiating trade deals/openly competing with
1708 2018-10-29 20:20:39 Introducing soon:

Try the Caesar Salad Classic

Grilled chicken breast 
Lobster slices embedded within Boston lettuce flower. 
Use balsamic and olive oil!
1709 2018-10-29 20:20:29 Of course we have.  Take our oil money and give us a deficit in return
1710 2018-10-29 20:20:27 Jamie’s olive oil stop spending and talking shit then
1711 2018-10-29 20:20:25 This hot oil treatment rey be everything 
1712 2018-10-29 20:20:25 45th has stated he is against racism. If I was a weekly bank robber and said I'm against robbing banks would you believe me? Why should we believe 45th just because he said it? America I might not know enough to fill a teaspoon but I can tell the difference if its water or oil.
1713 2018-10-29 20:20:15 Deep-fried meat with vegan oil and breadcrumbs?

Yeah, I think our wood stove is getting another year of use lol
1716 2018-10-29 20:20:05 Mdrrrrrrrrr eh oil était armé de son meilleur opportunisme comme a lepoque fornite ou on pistait des mecs pdnt 20min
1717 2018-10-29 20:19:59 The media are owed by the same people we sell arms to and same people that we keep borrowing  money from.  If we break away from those two influences we would be a hell of a lot better off. End the Fed and quit importing oil.
1718 2018-10-29 20:19:42 อยากอ้อนและงอแงใส่ใครก็ไม่รู้ คิดถึงเลยยยยย
1719 2018-10-29 20:19:42 Lanolin (oil derived from sheep)
1720 2018-10-29 20:19:42 Not really - with less cash comming in there would have had to be higher taxation, lower service levels of a combination of both. Without oil they may well have been correct.
1721 2018-10-29 20:19:36 Seriously you obviously are a historical revisionist, oil and gas industry is in tatters many people are out of jobs taxes are Sky High this is only since the NDP have come into power they were a protest vote that is an abysmal failure Jason Kenney the next Premier of Alberta

1723 2018-10-29 20:19:35 Really, it won't matter when Bolsonaro opens up the Amazon to oil/gas and other extraction/destruction companies, because - liberal democracy or not - we won't have any more air to breathe.
1724 2018-10-29 20:19:27 For Modi , its all about Dhando/Rokhra $$$. If Sharia bank , Trade with Wahhabis (apart from oil imports) is beneficial for his Crony capitalist friends (his party financiers) then he will pursue it wearing the Hindutva mask.
1725 2018-10-29 20:19:26 Link to the tweet pls
1726 2018-10-29 20:19:24 I just got sent spam emails from @AMD email addresses. One for home warranty and one for cannabis oil??
The entire thing was a single image, including the 'unsubscribe' button.
1727 2018-10-29 20:19:22 The west's unwillingness to stop using oil from dictators & use alternative energy sources has been like pouring gasoline on the internecine fires already smoldering in the Middle East, just as our greed for illegal drugs fuels the vicious brutality of drug cartels & the Taliban.
1728 2018-10-29 20:19:12 You mean the £9bn it added to gov income, that's less than we send to EU. Oil revenue is tiny, and declining as UK slowly goes for renewables.
1729 2018-10-29 20:19:09 1.) She won't be old enough to run
2.) She is unintelligent
3.) Rational people with even a minuscule of economic education will not buy the snake oil she is selling.

1732 2018-10-29 20:18:35 wait; isnt Poland Oil Refining Companies at the mercies of Russia?! and E.U. trade influences Poland Political cards while U.S. and Poland have close ties because of NATO?! Poland is improving but not in a way that is reforming perception of Foreigners who live in Poland.
1733 2018-10-29 20:18:10 Our children will laugh at us for believing in this climate con and compare it to other fads like the belief we are running out of oil or the Earth will be destroyed by the end of the Mayan calendar or belief in pyramids.
1734 2018-10-29 20:18:03 See a lot of focus on the wider markets at present which will have an impact but what the bottom end of #AIM is lacking is a new story, new bubble (e.g. dot com/oil $20-$80) & surprise over delivery to spark life bringing speculative risk on money to attract the herd to market
1735 2018-10-29 20:17:44 @fairylore this revolution which we are only beginning will be sort of like the transition from our horse and buggy & oil lamps  into the world of modern electricity. You’ll note there are still some areas of the world that are not electrified.
1736 2018-10-29 20:17:43 rosehip oil!! pls choose cruelty free
1737 2018-10-29 20:17:38 By early next year, the largest offshore production vessel ever delivered to Nigeria will start pumping crude... boosting oil output by about 10%. The project, viewed as the most ambitious in Nigeria’s history, could help to push production to a record by 2022.”
1738 2018-10-29 20:17:35 can restaurants dead ass stop...using Peanut Oil....thanks

1741 2018-10-29 20:17:25 Sunflower oil is not Keto friendly.
1742 2018-10-29 20:17:11 Maybe if we STOPPED ENRICHING DICTATORS we wouldn't need so many bombs. We deposed Mossadegh & supported the Shah which resulted in the Iranian lunatic fringe. We armed/supported Saddam Hussein which gave rise to Islamic extremism there. Our oil money funded Osama bin Laden.

1747 2018-10-29 20:16:11 Just soak your head in conditioner let it sit for about 10 mins and it’ll slip right off, or use a lot of oil sheen and gently pull the hair off
1748 2018-10-29 20:16:09 Sooo... gun oil from the barrel. Who else is going to bring that up.? Cruz is a complete idiot.

1754 2018-10-29 20:15:46 Whip together 4 cups carrots with 9 oz chew. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve for brunch
1755 2018-10-29 20:15:43 This is so messy - that has nothing to do with CBD oil. If you are going to bash anti vaxxers don't bring CBD oil into it. There is already way too much stigma and you are being part of the problem right now.

Bye Maxim good luck changing the world with negativity
1756 2018-10-29 20:15:38 Coconut oil will loosen the chemical properties and the tracks should come out
1757 2018-10-29 20:15:29 Yes but the palm oil?
1758 2018-10-29 20:15:25 There’s an oil free neutrogena moisturizer that’s really good
1759 2018-10-29 20:15:22 The financial industry that developed in the late 70's and 80's generated way more revenue than oil though obviously everything helped. Scotland contributed to the industrial issues as much as the rest of the UK - too slow to adapt to a changing world.
1760 2018-10-29 20:15:07 I suppose once the smear is applied, it sticks like crude oil and can't be completely wiped away. Only one question exists. Is the hypotheses, he did what was stated in Court, true or false? We know it's possible but is it true?

1763 2018-10-29 20:14:44 For me, I like long showers and videos of Tibetan singing bowls. Also, vitamins and supplements can do wonders for mood and energy. Turmeric and neem oil are anti anxiety.

1765 2018-10-29 20:14:29 100% true, Roger. Plastic, being made from oil, is actually quite energy-dense, and is a great feedstock for pyrolysis ... but noooo, the left hates using it to make electricity because feelz!

1766 2018-10-29 20:14:28 October has been a slow and painful getting-out-of-sludge-brain effort. Finally some lightness and fluidity returning to thinking. Wish there was something like an oil change for the brain.

This is what you are, you fraud, a snake oil salesman whipping up a bunch of hateful trash humans.
1769 2018-10-29 20:13:59 Oil and water together, how can I be whole? I'm like this hair, all strands and hiding places, yet out in the wide-open too like the moon.
1770 2018-10-29 20:13:54 I’ve been rubbing my eyes w coconut oil for the past 2 hrs and even let it sit on my lashes overnight and the lash extensions are still not coming off wtf
1771 2018-10-29 20:13:47 I read somewhere it had to do with the oil crisis in the 1970s but it had already been in use during WWI and between the wars #writeforum

1773 2018-10-29 20:13:27 I'm laid up in bed but the most important thing is my mom's and clean sheets, bathed,  lotions,  powdered and hair washed. That's what matters to me! Next time I'm going to give her a manicure and pedicure . I have a huge bag that holds everything from polish to cuticle oil
1774 2018-10-29 20:13:26 I figured it out via Wikipedia list, and based on the fact that his page includes "was an opera singer and oil painter before pursuing stand-up comedy," I'm going to re-forget his name
1775 2018-10-29 20:13:20 3 members of civil defense were wounded when a fire broke out resulted from the collision of an oil tanker with a car in Fayda district , south of Duhok.
1776 2018-10-29 20:13:19 Wow, I had no idea they donated to this Nazi-loving piece of garbage. 

That's too bad. I love their Light Butter with Canola Oil, but I've bought the last of it for my family, at least until they publicly repudiate him and donate a greater amount to his Democratic opponent.
1777 2018-10-29 20:13:10 It was the world finacial centre before oil was even discovered. 
Oil only adds 9bn to the treasury that's about 1.5% of gov spending, it doesn't even cover the extra £13bn you get given from English tax payers

1781 2018-10-29 20:12:31 Looks to be really well written - does the extended article dive into LDL particle size at all? There was a nifty article just published in Nutrients related to fish oil intake and ldl/hdl particle size. PMID: 30297663

1783 2018-10-29 20:12:28 I just scheduled an oil change before the light on the dash came on. I’m officially an adult.
1784 2018-10-29 20:12:25 Also, I can't stand wool next to my skin and I think making fleece from oil is a much better use for it than burning it in a combustion engine #EthicalHour
1785 2018-10-29 20:12:21 I think exxon were the ones finding the oil, but still. Intervention during move towards independence, Jonestown, and now oil. Top three you think?
1786 2018-10-29 20:12:14 @ImranKhanPTI u can't run pk as u r doing u should have taken sharif/zardari assets exiled them until they prove where money came from
1787 2018-10-29 20:11:53 Did you put the oil in the ground?Did you vote for or support any of the Obama era economic initiatives or the annual budgets? The answer to all of this is a resounding “no”. It is appalling that you think it’s ok to plagiarize Obama’s economy, while working so hard to thwart it.

1789 2018-10-29 20:11:38 Aye, bankrolled by our Oil

1792 2018-10-29 20:11:26 More oil
1793 2018-10-29 20:11:23 Well - it definitely helps to discern the truth.  Gives a whole new meaning to a devil in sheeps clothing.  I see him more as a snake oil salesman the way he travels and peddles his goods. Don't let it distract from your faith or the devil wins. And... Mission accomplished.
1794 2018-10-29 20:11:19 where can i buy body oil from in bmore:/
1795 2018-10-29 20:11:03 I don't think it's in a place I can put anything like a patch/bandage. Might look into the oil

1802 2018-10-29 20:10:16 This oil better be growing my hair while it’s braided that oil was high asf
1803 2018-10-29 20:10:13 I always recommend the tea tree oil one to ppl Bc it helped my industrial heal Bc it started to form like keloids but it’s a-okay now
1804 2018-10-29 20:10:11 Conditioner or baby oil may help it slide out sis. Next time makenthe wig in a mannequin head it’ll be easier 
1805 2018-10-29 20:10:05 Mmmmm Duchess, have you nevfur tried butter.
It is lovely, especially when done in secret when grandma forgets to put it back in the fridge .
It has to be real butter though, not that fake spread or olive oil stuff  likes

1808 2018-10-29 20:09:45 Coconut oil. Take a teaspoon a day
1809 2018-10-29 20:09:30 Yes!!! It’s really soapy, too much of the foaming agent I think. I cook with coconut oil a lot but haven’t really used it on my skin. I’ll try it tonight and see how it goes. I seriously need the moisture. Thank you 
1810 2018-10-29 20:09:17 I wish I owned multiple places, Andrew. I am fortunate that the oil company I work for provides us housing, and I'm also fortunate to have rented out my place back there. Hey - I hope that you're able to find some peace. I truly mean that. Take care.

1821 2018-10-29 20:08:03 So because the incompetent UKGov screwed up the economy which brought us to the brink of bankruptcy in the 70's then fortunately for them oil came along & saved their weak assess, you think by sticking with these incompetents is a good thing? Really?

1839 2018-10-29 20:06:45 I have this issue on my elbows and hands. I found giving up lotion and using oils like almond oil really help. Don’t use coconut oil though, it will make it worse.
1840 2018-10-29 20:06:42 Just clean and clear, day cream and anti aging oil 
1841 2018-10-29 20:06:21 Look one of my coworkers replaced an entire engine because she just didn’t change the oil ever and I just.....I just....

1844 2018-10-29 20:05:50 The fact that China wants to buy oil with its own currency will increasingly present Saudia with a dilemma. It could acknowledge that China is now the world’s largest oil importer, and only major growth market, and accept renminbi payments for its oil. However the US...=>
1845 2018-10-29 20:05:41 Coconut oil and water - got it! Also at what age can I start moisturizing my daughter's hair? And do you know what i can use thats child friendly? She's 1 with 4A hair.
1846 2018-10-29 20:05:36 ooooo just keep flushing it w warm water. How fresh is it? Or get like those travel size spray bottles and fill it w a saline solution or diluted tea tree oil and spray the area??? My ears are pretty sensitive too but all of my piercings healed pretty well so far
1847 2018-10-29 20:05:17 The only thing I would use from Old Spice is the soap and deodorant. Fuck the beard oil, shampoo, and other shit.
1848 2018-10-29 20:05:14 Media is a clown show with 24/7 hate trump bs. Trump got 2 scoops, trump drinks 12 pepsi's a day, trump drops umbrella. 
You know anything at all about job training programs? You know about expanded SBA loans? Probably not. Things that matter get no press
1849 2018-10-29 20:05:07 Know what it’s missing? A simple two paragraphs on what brazil’s main industries are. Oil, we know. What minerals? What fruits, agribusiness, and so on. That would definitely just give it a little more life
1850 2018-10-29 20:05:07 Stop wasting taxpayer-funded clean elections $$$$!

Well over $1M to date.

It would benefit low income Mainers, by filling their oil tanks this winter, Terry.

1851 2018-10-29 20:05:01 Two slices of pizza are the equivalent to swallowing 3 spoons of warm oil. Do you feel like eating pizza now?
1852 2018-10-29 20:04:57 Oil trades in a global market, so the only thing that frees up economies from the vagaries of that market is getting off of oil altogether. This was obvious 14 years ago when we wrote "Winning the Oil Endgame", and it's still true.

1855 2018-10-29 20:04:24 He never tweets about the price of oil going up but I bet his Russian and Saudi buddies are pretty happy with that aspect of trump’s economic plan
1856 2018-10-29 20:04:23 Good evening. Ahead of the coming #EIAReport, the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) has shed another 1.846 million barrels over the past week down to 654.9M. This is taxpayer oil that is sold to commercial entities; hence added to commercial storage/use. #OOTT
1857 2018-10-29 20:04:20 Forget the lotion. Lotion is water based. Use coconut oil, mustard oil (get it from the Indian store and no, it doesn't have a scent), olive, grapeseed or avocado oil, or Shea Butter. (Real SB is beige) Also, mix any 3 of these and use with heat as a hair conditioner.

1864 2018-10-29 20:03:13 is baby oil made from babies?
1865 2018-10-29 20:03:00 Botulism is anaerobic I believe. Sugar/water don't work like oil.
1866 2018-10-29 20:02:58 You know what, you’re totally right. And ultimately, most carbon will be converted into oil after being buried for several million years. So which one is more reusable? Think about that

1878 2018-10-29 20:01:56 It was an approved volvo dealer who looked at the message on my dash.  Told me it could be impurities in the oil, an early warning or a faulty sensor.  Then told me I should wait until my next service in Feb/ March.  Is it a serious warning or just an overly sensitive sensor?
1879 2018-10-29 20:01:52 Like 4C, your hair is prone to breakage and dries quickly which makes it coarse. To manage my hair, I frequently spray my mixture of coconut oil and water. Just keep it moisturised and avoid manipulation or else it will break.
1880 2018-10-29 20:01:49 A laconic golf course. It smells like oil, there are echoes of hip pop music, the lawyers created this place, and it's a bit dark khaki.
1881 2018-10-29 20:01:42 Big team goes through rough patch. It happens. Most likely just needs an oil change rather than new wheels.
1882 2018-10-29 20:01:22 Oil is more expensive and we can’t buy it from Iran. Mission accomplished.
1883 2018-10-29 20:01:18 While Norwegians were being made millionaires, the myopic and greedy CONservatives totally mismanaged billions of oil dollars, managing to make Alberta a 'have-not' province. Better reelect them to screw you some more, Alberta.
1884 2018-10-29 20:01:16 Oh no :c you should try other alternatives, I find peppermint/spearmint oil soothing when applied to the temples.. hope it helps you too 
1885 2018-10-29 20:01:09 Guess that's a way around US laws regarding Oil & Gas export towards the EU by the US 
Obama wanted Congress 2 fast track a law allowing the US to export fracking hydrocarbons to the EU it never passed
It also runs counter to canadian Trudeau gov promiss regarding clean energy
1886 2018-10-29 20:01:07 The west for the west, we have everything we need for o become one of he most prosperous Nations on Earth! If we continue to be abused by Ottawa, then Ottawa can do without our oil $$$, which we will have, all the mega billions! Manitoba, Sask and Alberta! Awesome!

1888 2018-10-29 20:00:56 It's simply roasting everything in the oven on a cookie sheet with olive oil and spices, and then putting it on a bun, or over rice, or if you really want low carb by itself. I'm going with large sausage buns.
1889 2018-10-29 20:00:52 TRUMP gets the last laugh on this issue because Trump warned early on about the Russia oil pipeline and the huge migrant problem in Germany.  Demographics is rapidly changing in Europe with migrant hoards changing Europeans view of their Country and establishing lawless areas.
1890 2018-10-29 20:00:52 Yes just oil It up real well the next day it should be ready to take out good luck!
1891 2018-10-29 20:00:46 And Trump made him a target cause he couldn’t take the questions...questions every president could endure with grace and civility.

1896 2018-10-29 20:00:13 Kellyanne Conway, if paid enough, would say motor oil tastes like chocolate sauce.

1901 2018-10-29 20:00:01 When granite and other natural-stone slabs or tiles are optimally sealed, cooking oil or salad dressing can simply be wiped off. A good seal will not allow fluids and other substances to penetrate the stone.

1903 2018-10-29 19:59:50 My body loves squalene oil. I use it on my hair and face. Once a week I exfoliate my skin. I take 2000mg of fish oils per day.

1910 2018-10-29 19:58:47 The admission that he's selling snake oil to the credulous and non-thoughtful says a lot about his product.
1911 2018-10-29 19:58:45 It's part of it.  Oil workers produce billions of dollars in revenue, but they don't get paid millions of dollars
1912 2018-10-29 19:58:37 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1913 2018-10-29 19:58:36 Its not that tragic. Oil removes hair glue pretty easily.
1914 2018-10-29 19:58:18 All of them are mad
1915 2018-10-29 19:58:11 Colorado is leading the nation with a precedent-setting proposition for safer setbacks of fracking wells. Oil & Gas is disregarding people’s health + safety and spending millions to fight this. Coloradans please Vote #YESonProp112 and let’s make climate justice history!
1916 2018-10-29 19:57:50 Which relaxer do you use? My hair does the same but with Olive Oil it lasts a week.
1917 2018-10-29 19:57:50 Jamaican Castor Oil really does work for those who are trying to grow their eyebrows in full. I haven’t used it as consistently as I should have been & still see results 
1918 2018-10-29 19:57:45 But but...it would taste like gun oil...

1923 2018-10-29 19:57:17 I just made the best lunch ever. Watched 4 episodes of El Chapo. Changed my oil & brakes. Washed dishes. Cleaned the bathroom. Now I’m laid on the porch. I’m really old & washed.

1925 2018-10-29 19:56:32 He plays the victim?? He had bombs from the MAGABomber sent to his office after Donald called him the enemy of the state. Then trump says he’s unfairly called out and the real victim.

You e been #Gaslighted
1926 2018-10-29 19:56:25 Musalad uchazora dovi coz cooking oil you cant use it its expensive 
1927 2018-10-29 19:56:24 @SRuhle / Since 2015 the oil and gas industry has added millions of jobs. Trump had nothing to do with these jobs but he takes the credit. These jobs were created by new technology and innovation in our industry.
1928 2018-10-29 19:56:24 one thing bout that witch hazel & coconut oil it work good & fast

1932 2018-10-29 19:56:13 Lol. Don't let her fans see this
1933 2018-10-29 19:55:54 But a key point (made, e.g., in recent @IEA petchem report) is that single-use plastics are a small share of overall petchem oil demand growth, and oil use for petchem is likely to still grow robustly even with efforts to phase out.
1934 2018-10-29 19:55:51 The spider web tattoos next to your eyes were a very bold choice. You are obviously a person with a great deal a faith in your individuality. Anyhow, at the end of every shift you're going to want to scrape the flat top, change the fryer oil and top off the mayonnaise container.
1935 2018-10-29 19:55:29 Aye boy you ion need no more of that oil boy
1936 2018-10-29 19:55:24 15% increase in refining means 15% increase in fossil fuels from oil. China leads global refining boom @AlanJones @theboltreport @chriskkenny https//www.rt.com/rtmobile/news/latest/442516/html/

1939 2018-10-29 19:55:09 the smell of oil paint activates my fight or flight response
1940 2018-10-29 19:55:08 Hey Aeroterra Oil & Gas thanks for the follow!
1941 2018-10-29 19:55:08 According to Bloomberg, U.S. oil production has increased 25% since 2014, and this year could break the record of 3.52 billion barrels, set in 1970. Nat gas production is up 19%. And the boom is happening with fewer workers. Employment in the industry is down 20% since 2014.

1951 2018-10-29 19:53:04 You mean our oil bailing England out...otherwise they would happily dump Scotland...
1952 2018-10-29 19:53:01 I'd really love to see her reaction come February 2019
1953 2018-10-29 19:52:53 USA is failing to protect Israel they should deploy Marines on ground In gaza pull Israel out to avoid conflicts but they only went to Syria where there is oil. Why won't USA deploy to Gaza ashamed of america
1954 2018-10-29 19:52:34 They know a shit deal when they see one. Shame you, with (I presume) some worthless degree in economics and snake oil salesmanship can’t see it.

1959 2018-10-29 19:52:18 Oh absolutely! I've noticed a lot of companies are starting to specify the source of ingredients in the actual list, and specifying that their palm oil is sustainably sourced. A positive change 
1960 2018-10-29 19:52:17 USA is failing to protect Israel they should deploy Marines on ground In gaza pull Israel out to avoid conflicts but they only went to Syria where there is oil. Why won't USA deploy to Gaza ashamed of america

1965 2018-10-29 19:51:19 My favorite attack right now against Golden is that he wants to ban heating oil—a longstanding secret dream of Maine democrats that we're instructed never to talk about.
1966 2018-10-29 19:51:04 rubbing oil all over my hot body
1967 2018-10-29 19:50:57 Brown delivered the longest period of sustained economic growth this country has ever seen, but had to make up for 18 years of Tory Tax and Waste, and underinvestment. If Thatcher hadn’t wasted oil revenue there wouldn’t have been any national debt in the first place
1968 2018-10-29 19:50:52 @KamalaHarris / Since 2015 millions of oil and gas jobs have been created not by Trump but by new technology and innovation. He cannot take credit for these millions of jobs but he does.
1969 2018-10-29 19:50:51 Same with gasoline. The sun hit plants millions of years ago, that energy preserved in coal or oil for example, then burned to turn into thermal and kinetic energy (moving air in explosion) which drives motor. Carbon locked up for millions of years now in atmosphere
1970 2018-10-29 19:50:40 The Prius is getting an oil change and while I appreciate the vacuuming of my car.....I’m honrgy
1971 2018-10-29 19:50:32 65% drop in the last 12 months is a collapse by anyone's standards. All you snake oil salesmen should be looking for a new product to push to the marks by now.
1972 2018-10-29 19:50:24 La petrolera estatal #YPF empezó a encauzar el complejo industrial donde hasta hace pocos meses Oil refinaba sus combustibles bajo la tutela del Grupo Indalo. El concurso preventivo y posterior quiebra generaron un panorama de  que de a poco la petrolera empieza a aclarar.
1973 2018-10-29 19:50:11 Ooo! Oo! I can explain! America overthrew a democratically elected leader in the Middle East and instated dictatorships because of the oil business! Do I get a prize???
1974 2018-10-29 19:49:34 but everyone loves oil stocks. or they did in early October.
1975 2018-10-29 19:49:33 $OIL long here
1976 2018-10-29 19:49:30 I would not put my incompetent pals in cabinet positions. I would not appoint my family members to high ranking offices in govt. I would not purposefully sabotage healthcare for millions. I would not help oil buddies cover up a brutal murder. I would not nominate a drunk and liar

1982 2018-10-29 19:48:40 i don’t even like oil painting this is for my class!! more like self sabotage !!!
1983 2018-10-29 19:48:31 People pray for cake... but when God gives them eggs, oil, butter, batter, a pan and an oven they get frustrated and leave the kitchen
1984 2018-10-29 19:48:23 Hmmm, I have like oil diffusers at the moment
1985 2018-10-29 19:48:22 Lot of FUD in this bullshit article...for example, Tesla TRIED to get other auto cos interested in sharing their chargers... NO ONE DID! Also, the statement that they don't dominate...THEY DO! lack of unified standardization, I believe, is a purposeful delaying tactic by big oil
1986 2018-10-29 19:48:21 More direct to your question: I can only imagine the attack ads if oil and gas production were taxed at 78%.

By the way, I don't follow many SCOTUS cases, but the WA v. Cougar Den motor fuel tax case is up for argument tomorrow, Tuesday, October 30, 2018.
1987 2018-10-29 19:48:18 Any palm oil in it?
1988 2018-10-29 19:48:11 I sat in my car while my oil got changed and I guess I forgot that they lifted the car up... so here I am chilling on a lift
1989 2018-10-29 19:48:04 LMFAO anointing oil 
1990 2018-10-29 19:47:59 Because we would have had historically higher taxes and worse services. Norway may well have an oil fund but they also pay higher taxes, pay to visit the doctor etc and will be responsible for the majority of their decomissioning costs.

1992 2018-10-29 19:47:40 If you're using oil finishes, check the labels. Most are highly flammable until they cure. Lay cloths flat to let them dry before disposal. They can self combust if you leave them scrunched up!

1995 2018-10-29 19:47:32 Dear Random Passersby, there is a fine line between being “helpful“ and “arrogant and intrusive.” Please keep your sage advice about giving baby aspirin and CBD oil to my dog to yourself. She already has a vet. #mindyourownbusiness #youdontknowus #AmateurHour #snakeoil
1996 2018-10-29 19:47:28 It’s for white people. It just Absorbs the oil to make it look less oily. No cleaning involved. Kind of like when people put baby powder in their wigs when they’re too greasy
1997 2018-10-29 19:47:16 @SecNielsen Why don't you transplant a whole bunch of the cactus from the dessert right next to the wall they  are jumping and build a mote  of old motor oil. Bet you'd find a bunch of volunteers with bull dossers and end loaders that would would move the cactus for free.

2006 2018-10-29 19:46:17 We are so happy you have seen such positives from CBD oil!
2007 2018-10-29 19:45:57 Hahaha you'll be lucky if you make £9bn a year from oil. You'll get back control of a fossil fuel just as the world is going Green.
2008 2018-10-29 19:45:54 If you try medication, give CBD oil a try. Completely legal
2009 2018-10-29 19:45:53 All I needed to know to support this initiative was that big oil opposed it. I voted yes and urge all Washington voters to do the same.
2010 2018-10-29 19:45:49 Damn the mechanics that changed my oil are hot as hell 
2011 2018-10-29 19:45:22 Occupied. The Russians (and EU) take over Norway when it tries to stop oil production. Well-written and scarily believable.

The protest bands of the 80's like Midnight Oil? RATM? If they all 'stuck to music' then they wouldn't exist

2022 2018-10-29 19:44:26 Is there no end to the evil that seeps out of that hell hole. A thoroughly vile regime that goes unquestioned unchallenged and its transgressions of International standards ultimately swept under the carpet of 'hear no evil' 'see no evil', keep producing oil.
2023 2018-10-29 19:44:12 It's always  been about the oil.
2024 2018-10-29 19:44:01 Might have a chance of Indy once the oil has gone. Oil is Scotland’s curse
Oil wells in the North Sea. Food banks in the harbour
Only oil countries with corrupt govs or govs that threaten to stop trading their oil in $ r poor. So WM what’s the reason Scot has been kept poor?
2025 2018-10-29 19:43:23 No school today or work at Bosco so we out running errands. Oil change, new air filter, new wipers (front &back) & brake light installed.

2034 2018-10-29 19:41:42 Jeanie... your socialist anti Oil government has no plans to pay off the debt. This will be your grandchildren’s responsibility. NDP socialist governments give hand outs to you and the rest of the public sector. Meanwhile investors & employers have left while you wait! Sad.
2035 2018-10-29 19:41:26 Smart Balance is good.  Healthy too.  Are they funding bigotry?

Please I would spray anointing oil instead, gimme the money for ‘19
2038 2018-10-29 19:41:10 I appreciate the pun. The gov could freeze rail abandonment and encourage oil by pipeline to free up rail capacity.

2041 2018-10-29 19:40:59 /future profitability of established conventional oil and gas. That's why you're told to protest fracking when shale gas is involved, but not conventional oil and gas. You wouldn't have moaned about the North Sea being fracked because you wouldn't have been told it was happening.

2045 2018-10-29 19:40:42 @TheMarilynShow why do your presenters always seem to follow trends; e.g. why not chefs use Canola Oil which is one of healthiest & highest smoke point, & also CDN. Your guests always glom on to latest fads
2046 2018-10-29 19:40:39 Of course, they are trying to circumvent the sanctions and the appeasement policy helps them much

But #Trump oil sanctions on Nov 7 will be helpful to break them down

but surely they won't be in the rule for another 40 years

2054 2018-10-29 19:40:12 Mate. I’m not an expert on U.K. but crude oil is 2.5 times what it was at low point 2+yrs ago so that’s a big piece of increase. Plus, while fuel duty maybe capped, 20% VAT is also on fuel & it increases as crude & hence gas price increases.

2057 2018-10-29 19:40:08 Do you believe that oil is running out?
2058 2018-10-29 19:40:07 Mine was pretty patchy up until I hit around 22. It still has a little strip of bare skin in the middle, but using daily beard oil/boar hair brush has helped smooth it and appear normal.
2059 2018-10-29 19:40:02 My hair breaks and causes hair loss. Even my skin doesn't want coconut oil
2060 2018-10-29 19:39:59 If it's going to be in contact with food don't use white spirit and check the oil is "food safe", pure Tung oil is but different brands Danish oil have diff. additives.
2061 2018-10-29 19:39:51 Doing a live video at 6pm tonight about hemp oil. Let me know if you want to join. I won’t be posting it on my personal page but rather in a Group. 
If you want to tune in just click this link:
2062 2018-10-29 19:39:39 Forgive me for being dumb but.....  isn't fracking basically just smashing the subterranean ground into pieces?  Then taking away released gas/oil?   And people are surprised that subterranean ground which has been smashed up is unstable.......   or have I got that wrong?  :-)
2063 2018-10-29 19:39:38 Nothing new there, The Tories are all for keeping the Scottish people down trodden. They take our fishing, our oil, our whiskey, and expect us to live in poverty, Shame on them, they're disgracefull. 
We as a nation voted to stay in the EU. and  they refuse us a referendum.
2064 2018-10-29 19:39:38 Covered frying pan with a bit of olive oil. The oven just ends up cooking it twice.
2065 2018-10-29 19:39:36 something not made of oil (gasp)
2066 2018-10-29 19:39:35 Cashew nuts contain oil in the shell that is very irritating to the skin
2067 2018-10-29 19:39:26 TEA TREE OIL IS THE WORST SMELL DONT COME AROUND HERE WITH THAT VOODOO PUKE POTION
2068 2018-10-29 19:39:25 You must do the ad of Dabur Amla hair oil 
" ghane mulayam kaale Baal"
2069 2018-10-29 19:39:16 $38 but is realllllly nice. A little goes a long way and they have two different formulas-- the original and oil free.

Again though yaking into account your skin type will better help you to decide which foundation is best for you.

2071 2018-10-29 19:39:09 I suspect we're going to see a significant change in the "stability" of oil based plastics, with a move towards rapid degradation to a state equal to that of bio-plastics. View same in ICE tech vs electric, in auto. Net neutral life-cycle embedded energy, climate/waste impact
2072 2018-10-29 19:39:05 I don’t use chili oil much — unless I’m mixing an aioli to toss Chinese noodles in. (Also my stepmom (who’s a master Sichuan cook) mixes her own & I bring jars of that back to #NYC.) So I don’t have a favorite brand, sorry! I’ll ask for her recipe next time I see her & msg you.
2073 2018-10-29 19:38:56 Relatable on a grosser level: I can eat bread dipped in seasoned olive oil all day no problem, but give me pasta with olive oil in it and my entire digestive system exits my body within the hour
2074 2018-10-29 19:38:55 You are right there is plenty of propaganda coming from Russia, because of their oil interests. But the Kock Brothers are not looking out for Canada’s best interest. I care who is influenceing policy in my Country. The Kocks have bought the US by dollars paid to politicians.
2075 2018-10-29 19:38:54 cooking and oil jumped into my eye ow ow ow ;A;
2076 2018-10-29 19:38:53 I’m at Toyota getting my oil changed and I can hear the Emperor’s new groove on a tv but don’t know where it’s coming from and I’m sad
2077 2018-10-29 19:38:35 And remind me again why we are listening to this fool. The same fool that rode a commodity wave to stardom and then couldn't actually govern when it came time to and used $80/barrel as a price for his budget when oil was $36.

2079 2018-10-29 19:38:22 Oil tax revenues last year  was minus £350m  so where are you getting the billions to pay for the welfarestate in an independent Scotland. They are already in control of public sector pay if they wanted to give them pay rises they could they now have control of spending & tax
2080 2018-10-29 19:38:17 You make me sick. I am so embarrassed that you are the leader of our awesome country. I cannot wait until you are OUT.  You don’t represent us. You are a monster. Your HATE and LIES are what fan the flame. Unfortunately so many are brainwashed by the snake oil con man you are. 
2081 2018-10-29 19:37:47 Put some sort of oil on a earbud and roll It in your eyelashes
2082 2018-10-29 19:37:47 That's Awesome! I have had great success with CBD Oil! Have you been looking at curtain products?
2083 2018-10-29 19:37:37 Now I have no qualms indulging in quality stuff but no amount of almond oil or Shea butter makes the #kiehls lip balm worth £10... bought it anyway but, I don’t like that I bought it
2084 2018-10-29 19:37:23 Got some REALLY GOOD soap crit to make things even BETTER! 
-Include a physical ingredient sticker on the soap
-Try to increase lather rate using coconut oil and sugar
-Increase fragrance oil ratio per pound
I plan on making a small experiment batch using these and test it!
2085 2018-10-29 19:37:15 oil ah terrain dangereux, au revoir
2086 2018-10-29 19:37:08 it soaks up excess oil in your hair.
2087 2018-10-29 19:37:07 2018 08 17: Morning w-Margo. Business meeting w-Reanna. Work afternoon from home. Cook spaghetti w-scallops, olive oil, garlic & hot pepper. Hang out with Margo & Ollie.
2088 2018-10-29 19:36:42 For small pieces or irregular shapes I apply the oil with a paint brush; easier to control coverage. Leave it to soak in for about 20mins then wipe off any excess. Add extra 2/3 coats if needed.

2090 2018-10-29 19:36:29 Don't use Vaseline -- it traps heat . Use aloe vera or emu oil or Neosporin
2091 2018-10-29 19:36:23 Like I said , they’ll soon discover oil 
2092 2018-10-29 19:36:15 I'd rather go back to the days when the President tells us we are destroying the planet and don't care about our grandchildren because we use oil. I miss that morality and courage and unifying message.
2093 2018-10-29 19:36:11 Burrs-Trudeau don't care.They want to destroy oil and gas industry.Canadians are naive enough to let them get 
away with it.
2094 2018-10-29 19:36:06 It's Venezuela, & it's another popular RW talking point. Are we expected to ignore the fact that its economy was dependent upon oil exports & that it was undermined?
2095 2018-10-29 19:35:48 Riiiiight well that explains the ‘pick a side’ nature of it all. I’m not seeing a lot of balance in the responses! I wish there was more art in Bath other than oil paintings of rainy streets and thirty grand bronzes so we could arrange an art date (with my children of course).
2096 2018-10-29 19:35:38 @Slomins can i get costumer service thought Twitter or do i have to call for oil account info?

2099 2018-10-29 19:35:11 I've used cbd oil befor and didn't get any relief with it. Maybe I didn't use the right one, idk. Price is a big issue for me so I'm not sure if I can afford the really high quality cbd
2100 2018-10-29 19:35:06 Every time I make refried beans I feel like I’m getting ready to risk my life  that hot ass oil is nooooo joke
2101 2018-10-29 19:34:52 gotta put on body oils or body butters rich in oil right after baths/showers not lotion
2102 2018-10-29 19:34:40 My conclusion is that you can earn a nice living in academia peddling snake oil to gullible students.
2103 2018-10-29 19:34:37 I literally rushed to look for home remedies & here I am with my neck full of baking soda, olive oil and salt

2109 2018-10-29 19:33:43 trump is scheming to get Venezuela's oil for him and his bff putin.
2110 2018-10-29 19:33:42 I’m smart enough to not pay money to make this snake oil salesman & criminal any richer. But go ahead & give him your hard-earned money so you can feel the hate for two hours. God bless!

2112 2018-10-29 19:33:15 Yeah, now with this fascist antinationalist elected, the EUA will be able to steal all of our oil once again! Great! Back to the american imperialism! It sucks to live in Latin America! We'll never have peace!

2122 2018-10-29 19:31:51 Haha yeah they’re a bit weird at first but you’ll get used to them quickly! I also really like Jason and the argan oil and honey I washed my hair.

2129 2018-10-29 19:30:47 Speaking of spicy -- is there a brand of hot chili oil you like best? The jars I randomly pick are never as good as the hot chili oils I get at a good restaurant. I wonder if I could make my own by dumping dried hot red pepper flakes (the kind I sprinkle on pizza) into canola oil
2130 2018-10-29 19:30:42 idk why people hate running errands, I LOVE IT. Need to go grocery shopping? I’m down. Need to go get an oil change? Let’s go.

2132 2018-10-29 19:30:37 Olive oil. Real butter. That's what it's all about. Margarine is banned in my house. Who cares that it's more spreadable. Keep some butter on your countertop and voila!
2133 2018-10-29 19:30:30 The damp cloth lifts sanding dust, raises the grain for final sanding and gives you an idea of end result when you apply oil finishes. They will darken the wood slightly but I find they make the grain pop

2144 2018-10-29 19:29:18 Boil some water, when it starts to buble turn it off. Place the botte of oil in it for about 1 - 2 minutes and you should be good.
2145 2018-10-29 19:29:11 The oil in that stew

2148 2018-10-29 19:28:26 Are you serious? I think Thatcher might have that Q to ansa re oil revs.but Lab had a good run not some golden age.
2149 2018-10-29 19:28:09 No - the Scottish Government economists allocate 100% of oil taxes to Scotland in GERS. The tax rate is determined by the UK government.

2153 2018-10-29 19:27:50 Weirdly I remember the plot of one episode where linseed oil served as Chekhov’s gun
2154 2018-10-29 19:27:46 I’m also envious of anyone who can be in the sun for more than 20 minutes without getting pink and itchy without first applying Master Vampire Sunblock. (And my freckles would get ashy if it weren’t for coconut oil.) 
2155 2018-10-29 19:27:36 Naah don’t judge me but how can I do that?just microwave the oil or something 
2156 2018-10-29 19:27:34 Harvard/Yale educated elitists have always assumed they're a ruling aristocracy whom the proletariet is obligated to serve. They supported Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin in the 30s (the latter for oil) & have been subverting the Consititution since. They are FASCISTS.
2157 2018-10-29 19:27:31 This is democratic smoke & mirrors, they know 'Beto' is a Mexican-American nickname for 'Robert' thats how Dem's lure in Hispanic vote, like Hillary using a fake southern accent campaigning in South.

2163 2018-10-29 19:26:59 Yeah girl! I sometimes get a couple different kinds like an oil and some pills and some gummies so I have different things for different feels. Also if you smoke there are some good vape pens and strains out there that can give you the calming of smoking with the magic of cbd!
2164 2018-10-29 19:26:40 I only want the oil that flows from a pure vessel... not a messy one #letthatsinkin

2182 2018-10-29 19:24:57 I did try to deep fry scotxh eggs once, but that failed miserably! The breadcrumbs didn't stick to the pork at all! Soon as it touched the oil they slipped right off and floated on the aurface. 
2183 2018-10-29 19:24:46 Guna run my errands then reward myself with an oil bath and a sulfur mask  can’t wait
2184 2018-10-29 19:24:44 They dissolved. As they are designed to do. And the oil bound itself to the fabric.
2185 2018-10-29 19:24:41 ready for who? lol, the British 1945 you were still under British rule and you were nothing but ungovernable savage camel herders and knew nothing of oil, if you'd seen it at that time youse probably would of bathed in it or drank it. so stop that bullshit.
2186 2018-10-29 19:24:35 Have you tried CBD oil? It can take up to 2 weeks before you start noticing the effects but taken daily it can significantly help anxiety and depression. I had the same issues with anxiety meds and Cbd is a life saver!
2187 2018-10-29 19:24:35 I don't typically deep dry anyway. I usually cook everything in the oven. It tasyes different, but not the same as deep frying. I just hate buying the oil, then getting spattered all the time when trying to cook with it.
2188 2018-10-29 19:24:33 went to the dealership for an oil change, told donny and mars that they were gonna try and get me to replace my air filter. sure enough, ole boy just came out and asked #daddydidntraiseadummy
2189 2018-10-29 19:24:31 It could be also that so I resorted to aqueous mixed with olive oil, yona it works its kljust that aqueous makes me dark so end up lightning again. I wear make up so I use itoner to clean it which also makes it worse. Yoooh ghel angisazi ngempela
2190 2018-10-29 19:24:26 Capital's ability to spatially displace its conflict with the proletariat, say by moving to greenfield sites, is dependent on natural sources of energy, the consumption of which destroys our relation with nature. Again, oil is antagonistic to workers' interests. #cdnpoli #abpoli

2196 2018-10-29 19:23:33 Just be because he fulfills something he announced, it does mean it is good. The wall, the tax, oil energy, the Tarifs, ... just to name some
2197 2018-10-29 19:23:33 Therapeutic?! Not when I spend most of my time running away from the spit back of oil from the pan

2200 2018-10-29 19:23:25 So based on what you're saying the UKGov allocates 100% of oil taxes (which they decide the rate of) to Scotland which Scotland uses 100% of that 100% given to them by the UKGov? 

In which case they really are a shower of incompetent buffoons. 
2201 2018-10-29 19:23:24 Oooh pretty graphic description here of what happens when one is doused with flaming oil.

Granted, it's a troll, but still. #AmEditing #StoneHeart @GarrettAuthor

2205 2018-10-29 19:23:12 Long term I love it.  When oil was in the $40s, they did a hugh acquisition of land.  Smart company that thinks ahead.  Also issuing shares not cash.
2206 2018-10-29 19:23:07 I don’t use scales I just use a tablespoon for measurements. You need to let the mixture rest a while and also make sure the oil/fat in the tray is starting to smoke to get it to rise properly. 
Good first effort though :)
2207 2018-10-29 19:23:04 5 months in Yekaterinburg. Best & worst time ever. 

I should tell those stories sometime (and the one about dancing with Mattis) but not on open channel. Maybe on the locked profile. 

And I have fetch quests to accomplish. Because a car should have an oil change.
2208 2018-10-29 19:22:51 How is the discounted oil Notley’s fault? Been like that for years. Do explain Drew

2210 2018-10-29 19:22:45 @realDonaldTrump and these small countries are not numerical to stand against the United States. I hope Iran's oil will be completely cut off, on November 4th, I will say my last Twitter speech
2211 2018-10-29 19:22:38 Sautee a bunch of chanterelle mushrooms in olive oil & butter w some sea salt & crushed peppercorns. Pour them into a big oven-safe bowl. Cover with a biscuit crust. Bake at 400 for 20 minutes.
2212 2018-10-29 19:22:36 Typically when Canada enjoys a trade surplus it's b/c the price of oil (we send ~$75Bn of oil a year to America) went up. (We are America's biggest supplier of oil.) And for all that, we're a Nat'l Security risk? (!) Geezus, I guess that DEW Line, Mid Canada and Pine Tree Line...

2225 2018-10-29 19:20:54 So what. All CA babies are at least christened with in-n-out fry oil while their parents swear an oath to raise them to rebuke all other fast food chains. You’re not special.
2226 2018-10-29 19:20:15 @gretchenwhitmer All oil pipelines are "dangerous oil pipelines" ~ will you work hard to stop all oil pipeline projects under, inside, and over OUR Great Lakes?  If you care about access to clean drinking water you Must!  My vote depends on your response to this question.
2227 2018-10-29 19:20:14 Need more information.  Which one has more oil / money?
2228 2018-10-29 19:20:14 India needs to Drive more on Petrol and Diesel to get a Good deal on Oil , all passenger and Private Transportation Vehicles should run on Petrol and Diesel. Since the Domestication of CNG- Problems have been endless.

2234 2018-10-29 19:19:53 Scotland must be the only oil rich country in the world with food banks. All caused by the Tory government appalling welfare reforms.

2247 2018-10-29 19:18:32 That moment when you work at a Oil Refinery and all the units lose power. Well let’s just say we have been sitting around all day doing admin work.
2248 2018-10-29 19:18:23 You can talk about oil companies, the environment, electric cars - anything you want really - but it's still a fact that the Tory Govt haven't put up fuel duty for the last 8 years.

And that's saving motorists about £1.25 a gallon on fuel + council tax + tax threshold rises...
2249 2018-10-29 19:18:23 That’s oil billions for ya.

2251 2018-10-29 19:18:07 Screw it, I'm writing about SEX tonight. It's as much a part of motorcycling as changing oil and doesn't get a fraction of the attention!
2252 2018-10-29 19:17:58 Sprinkle a little salt in your pan if you're frying. This will prevent the oil from splattering.
2253 2018-10-29 19:17:56 Oil tax revenues are allocated to Scotland as part of an accounting exercise - GERS. UK Government taxes the profits of oil companies and uses the tax revenue to provide services.

2257 2018-10-29 19:17:16 and giving industry a pass -  all the while pushing a new larger pipeline to sell more  oil and gas to the world at a faster rate ...
2258 2018-10-29 19:16:40 Just remember you might disagree with the method, but their needs are the needs of your constituents as well. Folks want to keep burning oil and have lower taxes, and you have to figure out how they're going to heat their houses and provide things like healthcare affordably.

2277 2018-10-29 19:14:54 Now it seems like the Colombians onboard as well. Interesting to see what the Chinese do considering they loan Maduro some 60b over last few years and is heavily invested in the oil industry.
2278 2018-10-29 19:14:40 We need more oil in our pictures!
2279 2018-10-29 19:14:37 $TSLA is a gnat on the fly on the oil market. They are having zero effect. When the majors finish rolling out their electric cars, there may be a slight impact.
2280 2018-10-29 19:14:11 Great isn’t it? Brexit lunatic Minford advocates running down U.K. manufacturing base whilst Brexit lunatics in parliament dismantle the fin. services sector.

2281 2018-10-29 19:14:10 Everyone who sells EVOO should be required to stock an equal amount of slutty olive oil.

2283 2018-10-29 19:14:07 I received an email today from a “Nigerian” oil company that wants to send me $385 million, I’m not sure why your tweet would have offended them nor do I feel we should continually have to apologize for everything we say these days!

2294 2018-10-29 19:13:21 PDP and their supporters are heartless and devilish. Imagine, after earning so much from crude oil, they have nothing to show for it in terms of infrastructures, they still have the guts to present another thief as their presidential candidates.
Are these people alright?
2295 2018-10-29 19:12:55 To be the Europeans enemy you don’t have to do anything to them, you just have to posses what they want. Gold, diamonds, oil, green land and white beaches, even your knowledge! Don’t underestimate the value of your knowledge, because they don’t...

2315 2018-10-29 19:10:20 Don't forget to count Guyana as well.. with the oil wealth suddenly discovered and Exxon massively there the circle closes definitely the context too much harder for Venezuelan government to handle.. this why Russian and Chinese advisors coming lately.. aside from financials
2316 2018-10-29 19:10:15 The mumu nature of the majority of the fools is the issue here bro..there are a few individuals here with homes worth millions of $ from our oil money.. we don't know how to fight for our rights!!!
2317 2018-10-29 19:10:07 Dnt be fooled, the anointing oil sales have declined immensely hence he goes for another play. Preying on the vulnerable and desperate. Christianity is now a profession and miracles a currency.

2324 2018-10-29 19:09:25 Actually no. Saturated fat is good too. I wouldn’t mainline the stuff, but bacon and beef, avocados (obviously) coconut oil, good fats. What you don’t want are processed fats like corn oils. Stick to the real stuff like butter, coconut, and avocado!

2328 2018-10-29 19:08:53 Don’t buy products with palm kernel oil. In fact, just quit buying so much stuff, driving and traveling so much. We consume far far more than we need.
2329 2018-10-29 19:08:50 @BBCTheOneShow 5/10 for the environment! #ClimateChange was not mentioned once is the #budget and oil/gas companies got a £3 billion tax break #theoneshow
2330 2018-10-29 19:08:46 The pilgrimage industry is the country's second most important after oil and gas. Hajj and the umrah pilgrimage estimate $12 billion a year to Saudi GDP. Hajj alone is $6 billion a year.
2331 2018-10-29 19:08:37 Kusugak was talking about how they used to use motor oil to keep the dust down. He sounded wistful for those simpler times.

2333 2018-10-29 19:08:22 If the oil companies want to frack in Cornwall, they will frack in Cornwall. Don't pretend this climate change denying government is in charge here.

2335 2018-10-29 19:08:13 Definitely need to do more on fuel. Oil prices drop, prices at the pump dont. The tax on fuel is scandalous
2336 2018-10-29 19:08:11 We’re making a pie tonight. Andrew asked me to get oil and squash. They were out of squash so I brought back a pumpkin. He meant diluting juice. We have a pumpkin extra. Between the two of us, we have that perfect spoopy photo.
2337 2018-10-29 19:08:11 It’s just hair glue. Grease/oil tf out yo head and pull it out, with enough oil it’ll slide off.
2338 2018-10-29 19:08:08 @simpleskin have you discontinued your oil balancing moisturiser? I can’t seem to buy it from anywhere!

2344 2018-10-29 19:07:36 Boiling oil is the best remedy.
2345 2018-10-29 19:07:28 The #bcpoli Spec Tax was actually an awesome thing to target the untaxed offshore tax evading #VanRE investors.  I agree about the anti-pipeline rhetoric being ridiculous as it's needed for Canada's income/jobs. We should be selling oil to #China ASAP. BC is dying though.
2346 2018-10-29 19:07:23 :) I made it a year and the house is still standing! In the storm I was using oil lamps to light and could see my breath in the house. It was built in 1799 so it felt fitting!  Next immediate step was to install a woodstove.

2350 2018-10-29 19:07:00 Iran is there. It's a shia nation and they have oil money and I heard there are accusations of Iran funding terror groups, if a nation like this shows interest in Nigerian shia, then we are in trouble.

2357 2018-10-29 19:06:28 Isn't that very pipeline pumping oil right now?  Or are you talking about a future pipeline?
2358 2018-10-29 19:06:18 Why is it taking these clowns 2 hours to change my oil 
2359 2018-10-29 19:06:17 Beautiful country and people.

2372 2018-10-29 19:05:19 But apparently the oil is keeping us young, so maybe be get laser eye surgery and become the powerhouses we’re meant to be.

The best part is the oil makes you smell like wealth and candy 
2379 2018-10-29 19:04:55 I think you have been found out and are now viewed as snake oil salesmen, sorry, snake oil salespersons peddling unscientific claptrap.
2380 2018-10-29 19:04:47 No way are they better off! Have you seen the rate of increase in fuel prices? All uncontrolled by this Govt bring in fuel price watch now! Oil companies are profiteering by not reducing prices when crude goes down
2381 2018-10-29 19:04:38 Would love to try this facial oil, thank you for the chance.
2382 2018-10-29 19:04:31 the cooking oil
2383 2018-10-29 19:04:24 Yes same with anything. I changed my transmission oil myself and it cost $80 in materials and a few hours of my time. I could have paid a shop $300 as an alternative

2385 2018-10-29 19:04:18 I take CBD everyday (oil under my tongue) and it helps balance my mood out! No psychoactive component!

2389 2018-10-29 19:03:16 Emma, as well as oil, salt and pepper I added some Worcestershire Sauce and 100% Pain hot sauce (only a few drops).  Mixed and cooked the same as yours.  Yum yum.

The times they're "at each other's throats" is just window dressing.
2393 2018-10-29 19:02:26 And hear I was hoping for a basic oil change !  that sucks, but at least it’s getting fixed
2394 2018-10-29 19:02:18 ... Takes 2.5 hours to do an oil change tho

2401 2018-10-29 19:01:43 We were wrong calling for a late cycle rally in Canadian stocks earlier in the year. #TradeWar impact on Asia was likely a big factor which our indicators did not pick up. Structural Cdn oil & gas issues also a missed factor (including #TransMountain pipeline fiasco).

But the US as a rule will leave a nation in much better condition than they found it. (Other than Bushes oil wars, where Obama followed with further destabilization.)

2416 2018-10-29 19:00:10 Do you think congressman and senators are experts on drilling Wells and how to regulate the oil industry and write laws pertaining to that? They ask experts usually experts working at oil companies only makes sense.
2417 2018-10-29 19:00:03 Be sure to use one that is pure, I seek out organic products in general.  Every oil isnt to be absorbed or ingested by humans & animals.
2418 2018-10-29 18:59:51 @MissionRCMP I charge justin trudeau and jean chretian for clear cutting my property for placer mining and drilling for oil and have them and others stopped, please retrieve money to feed bears 25% now 5% latter , the rest Well work out ok, keep ten % finder fee

2420 2018-10-29 18:59:20 america is def a huge issue.. although I worry more about a breakup of the EU, should far right parties get enough power to pull countries out. Brazil seems kind of isolated in their politics tbh.. venezuela is probably the bigger deal cause oil
2421 2018-10-29 18:59:05 Public police funds should not be used to investigate thefts caused by a business decisions to increase the impulse purchase of king size mars bars (I work for an oil company as well)
2422 2018-10-29 18:58:56 Kevin has a cold so I recommended your tip of frankincense on the chest. I think the fact he had to run it in himself was a bit of a disappointment  I was giving him my frankincense oil, what else does he want?! x
2423 2018-10-29 18:58:33 The market is what it is. Unfortunately oil money has made it sky rocket. We can't do anything about that. But if last year Neymar was sold for 200+ mil how can you sell the 5x Ballon D'Or winner for only 100mil and not look for a worthy replacement. NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT COST...
2424 2018-10-29 18:58:31 Key is to slice it thinly and loads of olive oil
2425 2018-10-29 18:58:30 Man oil paints are stressful. I’ve had no training for this project whatsoever and it’s due tomorrow. Echhh
2426 2018-10-29 18:58:18 Like even just slicing up a potato and putting it in there make incredible French fries but without putting any oil on them.
2427 2018-10-29 18:58:08 My dad does all the maintenance on my car and he isn’t around me. What kind of oil do I need? How much does an oil change cost? All these questions 
2428 2018-10-29 18:58:05 ahhh my room is nice and clean, clothes are drying, tea tree oil in the diffuser....refreshing.
2429 2018-10-29 18:58:04 Its like its time to buy the Arami glow oil and scrub.
2430 2018-10-29 18:57:30 My daddy know he wrong for that bathroom sink  got me asking myself if i really want him to change my oil 
2431 2018-10-29 18:57:29 @ddailyreport  I don't get it that without oil money, other sectors cannot be developed. How did countries doing well without oil get it?
2432 2018-10-29 18:57:22 It’s amazing. It fries food without oil. So it’s pretty healthy. Just depends what you put in it. Like sugar snap peas get a crispy outside but still pop with the peas inside. I got one for 60 bucks and just love it for everything in my diet.

2437 2018-10-29 18:56:44 I love the villain's scheme. It is such a clever twist and quite incisive commentary on foreign policy/dependence on oil. Bond's story is great as well and the way he dispatches Greene feels very Fleming. I also actually quite like the mad editing on the opening car chase.

2448 2018-10-29 18:55:23 If you blinked you may have missed the two important aspects for this area.
1) Taycities deal only gets 150 mil vs Holyroods 200 mil (were supposed to match)
2) Hammond talked about Scotland's oil and gas yet HMGOV receives all the revenue and we receive a portion back.

2454 2018-10-29 18:54:49 It is disrupting the oil industry. Until recently those industries have been inextricably linked, and therefore by extension @Tesla is disrupting the auto industry.
2455 2018-10-29 18:54:47 Even if the lie that "Mt Kenya" contributes 60% to Kenya's GDP is repeated a million times, it will never be truth. It would mean that maize, wheat, ndengu, beans, milk, fish, livestock, chicken, eggs, oil, clothes, building materials, labour, art,  et al. all come from Central.

2463 2018-10-29 18:53:54 Had a feeling that was coming. I’m thinking about it. You’re very persuasive. Like a snake oil salesman. Maybe it’s just the southern charm.

2469 2018-10-29 18:52:16 "Ah, I see! The robots going to go get more oil to refuel his brain!"

Monaka clapped.

"Farewell, Mr. Toaster!"
2470 2018-10-29 18:52:16 One of my reasons as well. Feel better. Maybe ACV or Oil of Oregano? Depending on what your symptoms are.
2471 2018-10-29 18:52:14 Couldn't agree more. We have a friend with severe MS.
The cannabis oil, which is freely available, has had a positive impact on both her mental and physical health.
Imagine what the  stronger, real thing could do.
2472 2018-10-29 18:52:04 I use the vitamin c range from the body shop but tbh I end up making masks and scrubs from home works better.
Wash with hot water put ice on your face right after, and COCONUT OIL!
2473 2018-10-29 18:51:51 GI isn't cyclical. Do you care about a recession if you need screening for a disease that's easily cured if found early, but kills you if found too late? When I think cyclical, I think oil/semis, not preventative healthcare with (at worst) a 2% drop in the Global Financial Crisis
2474 2018-10-29 18:51:44 
2475 2018-10-29 18:51:43 I think I still have some of that greasy oil that our old house keeper recommended (remember that stuff?).  Or I have scissors?
2476 2018-10-29 18:51:42 @BobMurphyEcon @ThomasEWoods @ContraKrugman Road construction is a state subsidy to the oil and gas industry, all those idling engines burning fuel sitting in neverending traffic.
2477 2018-10-29 18:51:18 Man these things killing me I’m at the office right now so I can’t do that. I put peppermint oil on them for them meantime.
2478 2018-10-29 18:51:17 You do know who her horrible father is right? If @PressSec is a real Christian...give me all the oil money because I am the Prince of Persia. Charlatans, that whole family.

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
2480 2018-10-29 18:51:12 True. I used to cure olives at home. Took lye (commercial process) to get the bitter out. Also used plain salt, to make oil cured olives.  Drat! Now I want olives. . .LOL

2487 2018-10-29 18:50:30 It was great! Learned about so many tools out there for EEMs and had really good conversations about how to process, model, and think about EEMs. And learned about DOM in oceans, lakes, rivers, ice, olive oil, etc!

2494 2018-10-29 18:49:25 Hocam crude oil bakabilirmisiniz?
2495 2018-10-29 18:49:24 That Venezuelan talking point is fear mongering that feeds our polarization. Oil is it's only product. What they face is largely from mistakes on price controls making it impossible to earn $ making needed products. The number 1 economy will never be a Venezuela & u know that.
2496 2018-10-29 18:49:20 And butter is basically oil waiting to melt soooo

2505 2018-10-29 18:48:13 Wait, wasn't Rockafeller a famous oil magnate?

Is this some professional jealousy? Or is it more like the current era of assholes are angry at the last era of assholes for trying to prevent their assholery?
2506 2018-10-29 18:48:06 @AngelaMerkeICDU Do not leave, don't let Trump Like candidates infect your country.  We are miserable here with Trump at the helm.  His marketing snake oil fooled millions.

2509 2018-10-29 18:47:16 Don't forget that oil and gas are also used to make plastics which are used in the manufacture of many products.  I don't like plastics but we can't do without them presently, alternative materials are needed for packaging, shoes, televisions, carpets, paints, etc etc
2510 2018-10-29 18:47:01 oil companies should foot the bill for all the destruction & rebuilding that climate change brings.

2518 2018-10-29 18:46:08 Putting peppermint oil in your joints is so life changing
2519 2018-10-29 18:46:07 The oil industry is used to unlimited expansion and ever weakening regulation.  Its about time the tide has turned.
2520 2018-10-29 18:46:06 So effectively as punishment? And quite happy to tar all those companies with the same brush then?
What about big media companies, or oil, or financial?

2539 2018-10-29 18:42:36 I like when u tweet about the OIL much better. Trump stuff is sooo repetitive. He's a douche. We get it. Lol
2540 2018-10-29 18:42:15 I use to clean a freezer warehouse. One night a dude flipped a forklift over because he didn't pick up a pallet of ice correctly. That turned my 9hr shift into 13.5hrs of cleaning up 500lbs of ice and oil all alone.
2541 2018-10-29 18:42:14 something that's covering their face
2542 2018-10-29 18:42:14 Sounds pretty good, till you consider cost benefit analysis aspects coming  into play distributing limited resources.  
Medicare will be rolled into this and considering a hip replacement for 80 yr old or a knee for a 20 yr old, which produces a higher ROI?

2545 2018-10-29 18:42:02 Someone asked earlier what the difference was between virgin olive oil and extra virgin olive oil. I thought (but did not say) that virgin olive oil had done anal but extra virgin only oral.
2546 2018-10-29 18:41:51 Has anyone stopped to think what taking so much oil from our planet is part of climate problems.

2556 2018-10-29 18:41:12 ya no duh considering that there is so much coal that its going to keep on being a cheap and abundant power source for at least the next 1000years unless someone were to find something better besides abundant .cheap and clean alternatives such as oil and gas.
2557 2018-10-29 18:40:59 what do y'all bitches have to offer except for head allday and a car that need brake pads, new tires and a oil change ??

2572 2018-10-29 18:39:31 oh yeah i was thinking of the kind of preservative that's also used for motor oil, acetone definitely isn't it

2582 2018-10-29 18:38:18 Either use Olive Oil, or glue remover (both are super easy to get). Dont tug on your hair, you may end up breaking it off. And next time please remember NEVER make a wig using your own head lol Just get a styrofoam head (theyre cheaper than the fancy ones but still do the job).

2599 2018-10-29 18:36:35 If we really wanted to be a world leader in clean, green climate change mitigation, we’d have used oil and gas revenue to make us a global leader in tidal, geothermal, energy storage and/or safe nuclear.
2600 2018-10-29 18:36:24 Iran oil related sanctions are probably coming soon. It will be embarrassing to attend RD parade less than 3 months after sanctioning the country. No big deal. International relations are not emotional saas-bahu serials. Its based on power politics.

2606 2018-10-29 18:36:00 Yesterday I learned that my Economy 7 storage heaters cost like £109 per month to run on the lower heat settings, so I was like “screw this, I’m going to run the oil heaters in the room I hang out in and see how it goes.

It’s £25 cheaper per month, but it’s way too cold.

2608 2018-10-29 18:35:42 It's great Steve. We get a 'Centre of Excellence' for Oil&Gas decommissioning, thus, as a nation, responsible for waste & pollution costing us billions whilst O&G companies run away.

2621 2018-10-29 18:34:15 But most ESPECIALLY when it has EVERYTHING to do with him AND those in power who "enable" him to continue his campaign of seizing on innocents to follow his hateful lead & incite violence.

2653 2018-10-29 18:31:25 This feels confused to me Neil. Other than the deeply dubious record of sector taxes having unintended consequences (see oil, bank levies, energy taxes etc.) you say simultaneously this tax will raise next to no money, and that it 'levels the playing field'. How can it be both?

2700 2018-10-29 18:25:18 Idk, the Indian Removal Act was one of the most cruel things USA has ever done in history, Reagan supported wars that killed millions, and Bush crashed the economy & went to war to steal oil.

2702 2018-10-29 18:25:10 And so it begins we've got Big Oil and now we have Big "Clean Tech" coming; to monitor the air, that we continue to pollute. You can't say you're acting on climate when you continue to expand fracking & all its downstream activities.
2703 2018-10-29 18:25:09 Just grate 3 carrots, mash up 2 overripe avocados, & add the olive oil to a pot. Boil it down until every thing is really soft(25 minutes) then strain it. Use the oil as much as you want just make sure you wash it out because it will stain literally everything

2715 2018-10-29 18:22:33 Blame for what? The booming economy? The record low unemployment? The fact we may finally have peace on the Korean Peninsula? The fact that the USA is now the worlds largest producer of oil and natural gas? That consumer confidence is at a 3 decades long high? I blame them too

2754 2018-10-29 18:17:59 Naive? I don’t consider myself naive.  Socialism and communism are responsible for 50-100 million deaths or more. I see what it did to an oil rich country in Venezuela.  I listen to Cuban Americans. It’s the politics of death and subjugation and equal spread of misery.
2755 2018-10-29 18:17:57 Express oil change
2756 2018-10-29 18:17:44 That one na #Frogs their mbangala, na their oil. What concerns us in an election that was boycotted by our people. Please henceforth write such rallying message of yours in your adopted language #French as your target audience should be the #Frogs
2757 2018-10-29 18:17:41 You know that @tedcruz does not want you to get money from the Oil producers in your state right?  It’s your oil that he wants to give away. Norway has a trillion dollars from their oil and its expensive to produce. That’s 35335.68 per Texan that you’re being ripped off.
2758 2018-10-29 18:17:39 For breakfast chilli, I would stick to a chilli with less savory / saltiness, and have a more subtle flavor of maple. You can also substitute sausage for hamburger, and sear it with a little bit of basil and olive oil (to give a lighter flavor). Then add red/green peppers too.
2759 2018-10-29 18:17:29 How screwed up is the @EPA when automakers, who would benefit immensely from these rollbacks, are in opposition to them? That tells me that big oil has the current corrupt administration in its pocket. But, really, we already knew that.
2760 2018-10-29 18:17:15 And gold diggers dig until they find oil 
2761 2018-10-29 18:17:10 How I she? I give warm water/ oil enemas to Bodhi it is really easy 
DM me if u want more info happy to help.
2762 2018-10-29 18:17:09 We need some Black Folk investing into Oil/Gas or those little energy fuels that Tesla use.
2763 2018-10-29 18:17:06 No other way to pour onions inside oil without the pot doing me shhhhhhhhhh???  This bachelor life is hard. Look at my body 
2764 2018-10-29 18:16:39 Listening to you speak so arrogantly and pompously on the radio tonight made me feel sick. One fact.....we have oil fields in the north sea and the need for food banks in Scotland and all across the UK is at an all time high. 1/2
2765 2018-10-29 18:16:36 Try castor oil, hair oil, yet compassionate to all.
2766 2018-10-29 18:16:36 Pray fervently that Elrufai will survive the political imbroglio and inferno looming on his head. It takes a living to mourn the dead! Open your mind and see avalanche of raison d'être that will bring Elrufai down. He will be one of most pitiable politicians in 2019.
2767 2018-10-29 18:16:26 Warm olive oil helps as does hot water bottle I was told with cover on it helped when I had it
2768 2018-10-29 18:16:22 Pour some of the Oil in the stew away
2769 2018-10-29 18:16:19 jensen told her not to tell us it was oil

2771 2018-10-29 18:16:02 I am definitely a night owl because i burn the midnight oil every single day.
2772 2018-10-29 18:15:59 Got it  yeah I usually put the oil in; I shall try it out with buttermilk/curd as well and share results  Thanks!
2773 2018-10-29 18:15:50 That was my neck. Do I need to put some oil on it said the Tin Man?
2774 2018-10-29 18:15:45 I dropped my car off to get an oil change and then walked to the gym to work out. I’d say that’s multitasking. #MondayMoves
2775 2018-10-29 18:15:23 With the price of oil and the gas to boil it, I need a different approach this year...

2780 2018-10-29 18:14:22 So fucking sick of cucks  if we're spending $ over there might as well take their oil
2781 2018-10-29 18:14:15 Oohh you use sesame oil? That's nice
2782 2018-10-29 18:14:10 Some warm olive oil - I’m not a GP btw
2783 2018-10-29 18:14:00 It's better to use buttermilk than just milk. Also don't just prepare the batter with butter alone, add in oil too.
2784 2018-10-29 18:13:49 @CaptAndrewLuck it’s the squirrel oil from home.
2785 2018-10-29 18:13:42 The seven companies, Standard Oil of New Jersey (later Exxon), Royal Dutch Shell, Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Later BP), Standard Oil of New York (Later Mobil), Texaco, Standard Oil California (later Chevron) and Gulf Oil were euphemistically called the 'Seven Sisters'.
2786 2018-10-29 18:13:23 Let’s all send @72Hallam Jenny a bit of love, court date in Feb in Australia. She faces 18 years in prison for giving away cannabis oil to the suffering and dying. The government in Australia should be ashamed. The world is legalising this plant, and quashing previous convictions
2787 2018-10-29 18:13:12 I love our Left-Wing People Focused Govt=BUT I do not like the arrogance in Openness and Transparency when it comes to OIA requests and Consultation on issues that affect us all=EG The Christian Prayer in Parliament and Oil Industry changes etc etc=Openness and Transparency NOW!
2788 2018-10-29 18:13:05 Nigeria is a corrupt economic joke. You sometimes can't even get petrol in Lagos - an oil exporting giant.

2790 2018-10-29 18:12:45 A few years since an injection of oil money made your club relevant again.
2791 2018-10-29 18:12:45 oil just took a hit from someones hammer too
2792 2018-10-29 18:12:44 From extreme cold weather early in the project, aging infrastructure (100+ yrs old), additional watermain replacements and an unknown buried oil tank, The St. David St. bridge will re-open mid-Nov. These delays were beyond the contractor’s control.

Major roads in Lagos make Ladipo people to sell shock absorber on weekly basis due to dungeon on Lagos roads .
Trunk C is no go area,in my LG they are filling it with building concrete & black oil.

2799 2018-10-29 18:12:09 Who exactly do you think you are going round telling people what to do . You sound like a snake oil salesmen
2800 2018-10-29 18:11:59 i used baking powder, flour, sugar, cinnamon, brown sugar, tried using coconut oil first and then avocado oil, vanilla extract, and oat milk. i thought it was my out of date flour first so i tried a better one. and i wonder if its baking soda?
2801 2018-10-29 18:11:55 Please do, sugar and powered flavor is normally added, plus tin milk makes it holds too much oil. In Shaa Allah she would be successful big time with so many opportunities of supplying kano’s chain stores.
2802 2018-10-29 18:11:51 Only thing I hate about wild growth oil is that it have me itching my head all day .

2807 2018-10-29 18:11:05 Yes, two people who strongly believe in harming indigenous peoples land for oil!
2808 2018-10-29 18:11:03 Isn’t the United States shrinking it’s public lands to allow for more oil drilling?
2809 2018-10-29 18:11:03 On Wednesday 31st October, I will be visiting the Oil & Gas UK Share Fair in Aberdeen. #iot #digitaltransformation #oilindustry #iiot #aberdeen #smartsensors #predictivemaintenance
2810 2018-10-29 18:10:56 im riding round in my car like it ain't due for an oil change... 
2811 2018-10-29 18:10:53 ‘Part of a scheme’.. All right-wing loonies like Charlie have are hyperbolic talking points and conspiracy theories. Facts and the far-right are like oil and water.
2812 2018-10-29 18:10:50 maybe Lena, Steven & JJ will produce the Bana girl story... I'm sure they won't discuss how taxpayer dollars fund a global homeless crisis we all refer to as #RefugeeCrisis. #HollywoodTaxCredits #Wars #GlobalFracking #Oil #WealthClass

2813 2018-10-29 18:10:47 What about the palm oil you use in your products, production of which is destroying large parts of Borneo and killing hundreds of Orang Utans and leaving hundreds more orphaned? At least they’re not being tested on though....#dove
2814 2018-10-29 18:10:40 I'd like to be a megamillions winner, an oil tycoon & be a Arabian prince & the ability to fly with superpowers...

2815 2018-10-29 18:10:35 So who owned the ship which dumped tons of bunker oil into the ocean off Karachi?

Why are the Balochistan and Sindh EPAs silent on this?

What does the Federal Ministry of Maritime Affairs have to say on this matter?
2816 2018-10-29 18:10:29 I put on a tea tree oil face mask and it blessed my skin today
2817 2018-10-29 18:10:21 Thanks big out of state oil companies! You really make it easy to know who the bad guys are. I voted YES on 1631.
2818 2018-10-29 18:10:20 見回り行ってきまーす！
2819 2018-10-29 18:10:09 You should treat your strands with Damaged hot oil treatment which has extra virgin olive oil, almond oil and organic avocado oil to get a serious dose of moisture!

2821 2018-10-29 18:10:01 Vegan hotwings. You fry the cauliflower flourettes like chicken in a pan until golden brown, then sauce like hot or BBQ wings. It's probably the most tasty way to do it. Don't use butter though, use like a penut oil or maybe a coconut oil if you are going tropical heat.
2822 2018-10-29 18:09:56 Hot oil treatment
2823 2018-10-29 18:09:49 US crude oil prices fell 20 cents to $77.42 / barrel helping a move up in transport stocks, Easyjet rose 2p to 1170, IAG was up 8p to 593.6p.
2824 2018-10-29 18:09:43 Where can I buy a essential oil diffuser from?
2825 2018-10-29 18:09:40 Good to hear,but those don't work so well here,,family had a few n had oil starvation problems,,amongst some ppl we knew,,also trans issues,,maybe it was assembly or parts issues,,but does go well when good.
2826 2018-10-29 18:09:04 Don’t worry. Once the snp get indie we will all have our own personal oil field in our back gardens and we will be dining on lobster.
2827 2018-10-29 18:09:02 Use annoiting oil
2828 2018-10-29 18:08:57 I want to start a business in Nairobi that will happens without a glitch.  I want to do business in the oil industry
2829 2018-10-29 18:08:49 We have the oil. I don't argue with fools especially uninformed folks.
2830 2018-10-29 18:08:48 Waffles have more oil in the batter, I think.
2831 2018-10-29 18:08:47 getting really angry and frustrated in @sainsburys trying to find sweets for halloween trick or treaters without palm oil in - ridiculous!
2832 2018-10-29 18:08:42 As I said, their challenges remain the same but surviving Oct gives them a shot, especially with what is the league's easiest schedule from Dec on. As far as 11/12 goes, Khabby couldn't sustain his .965sv%...shocker

"The way Real Madrid is going down, I think they will soon discover oil"

2836 2018-10-29 18:08:23 For the most part it’s not mineral owners being force pooled, it’s older oil and gas companies that either went defunct, don’t have the capital to participate or don’t manage their assets properly.
2837 2018-10-29 18:08:21 At root I think it’s about oil
2838 2018-10-29 18:08:12 Oof you’ve been guzzling back that hair oil
2839 2018-10-29 18:08:10 I once received an empty bottle of tea tree oil. Poorly packed, entire package was spoiled with leakage. However, they refunded the amount.

2842 2018-10-29 18:07:56 Just musing on some of my highlights from this half term. Getting up from scrabbling around on the carpet for an oil pastel, joints creaked and I let out an 'Ooh'...Pupil: "My mum makes that noise when she gets up"... #primaryrocks
2843 2018-10-29 18:07:55 Fake "bombs" to Democrats.
Real bullets to Republicans.
2844 2018-10-29 18:07:55 Yeah castor oil will definitely give you some growth but it takes forever IMO lol & yes I’m bout to dismiss the wig life for a little while. Especially frontals. But my real hair is in a pixie cut & it’s too damn cold for that. 
2845 2018-10-29 18:07:52 My face is acting up. Patchy, irritated. I use a fish oil liquid gel capsule on face, with some fish smell, but amazing results!
2846 2018-10-29 18:07:49 Also we need to invest as much money as possible in things such as green energy so we can move away from an economy floated by oil and weapons. But that’s my humble opinion
2847 2018-10-29 18:07:40 We would wait for Elrufia to mess you up politically then we will mess both of you up.

2850 2018-10-29 18:07:17 I think USA made mistake by not deploying To gaza to help Israel. I think Putin was wrong blaiming Israel. I think Israel and Syria should agree to stay out of each others countries. I think Trump is worse president ever syria for oil gaza no us help
2851 2018-10-29 18:07:04 Hope you got your money back for their snake oil 
2852 2018-10-29 18:07:01 One only has to look at who owns the various media. LOL Taken with an eye to their slant, the reveal their alliances. MSM = oil and arms stocks amply rationalized w white ascendant myopia and jovial cold war team sports.
2853 2018-10-29 18:06:53 Ayo if you put some typa oil in your hair like castor oil or sum will most likely break down the glue on your scalp

No marijuana hub
No middle of the woods music festival

2862 2018-10-29 18:06:12 Politician: there's no mining interest in Bears Ears. 
Geologist: The paradox basin is literally a textbook example of how oil can be trapped by salts.
2863 2018-10-29 18:06:08 You mean the Tories are doing absolutely NOTHING for the Scottish Oil & Gas industry.  Yep, we get it.

2867 2018-10-29 18:05:36 I keep a jar of lavender essential oil on my desk for this very reason. When I get frustrated or too stressed, tears are automatic and I don’t need that life at work

What can CBD oil help with...
2871 2018-10-29 18:05:12 With just 1k, she made a profit of over N400 yesterday, with sugar and oil still remaining from the initial ingredients. An average of 5days a week, and 4wks a momth, thats like N8k a month. Multiply that by 10 (with N10k capital) thats 80K a month. Unbelievable!
2872 2018-10-29 18:04:56 It's a catch-22 for sure. As Felix mentioned, Mahinmi is stiff as hell and I feel like sometimes he just needs to get loosened up before he can get into a rhythm. It's like the tin man needing oil, or some shit like that lol

2879 2018-10-29 18:03:54 I finished all my online homework. Then I got an oil change, my filter changed, my wipers changed, and a car wash. I think that’s enough adulting for today 
2880 2018-10-29 18:03:51 very minimal packaging is why i thought of it the fact that it has cannabis oil in it is just funny
2881 2018-10-29 18:03:46 why do we have a drug problem just watch TV or open a MAGAZINE, they are full of DRUG adds, making false STATEMENTS, hell  you have SNAKE OIL INFO selling this and that, they need to be controlled just like TOBACCO was in the 1970s and not allowed to advertise their products
2882 2018-10-29 18:03:35 My dad keeps posting stuff he thinks he's sending to me via a private message to my Facebook wall. Today's was "did you get oil changed?"
2883 2018-10-29 18:03:27 Rich brown coat. I saw one swim down the river on a bitter February day. Their oil must be hydrophobic, she looked like she was on, not in the water. Yeah, great animals!
2884 2018-10-29 18:03:15 It's actually quite simple and I don't generally measure anymore. I'm shooting for around 70% hydration, but I usually just go by feel. You want the dough to be tacky and sticking to your fingers a bit. Make sure you add a couple tablespoons of olive oil into the dough as well.
2885 2018-10-29 18:03:04 *Yawn* just more climate scam nonsense for the faithful and/or gullible. Peddle your snake oil elsewhere please.
2886 2018-10-29 18:02:58 Good to see Oil fans are staying classy
2887 2018-10-29 18:02:54 He appears to be an ignorant oil industry hack. He cares about preserving his own job and literally nothing else

2894 2018-10-29 18:02:10 This Snake Oil ad was brought to you in part by the the horrific #TrumpCrimeFamily and the spineless #administration @WhiteHouse 

Pack your bags and pack light cause your next stop you want need much.
2895 2018-10-29 18:02:09 And I need coconut oil and beeswax to start making salves.
2896 2018-10-29 18:02:05 I know right. I hate it when our PM deliberately manipulates global oil prices to make Alberta oil sands unprofitable. Purchasing a pipeline was probably just a ploy to confuse sympathies.
2897 2018-10-29 18:02:01 AND WE WORE THE SAME BOOTS FOR THE WHOLE 10 YEARS
2898 2018-10-29 18:01:55 Giving myself a pep talk to try to watch @PressSec press conference.  And maybe some CBD oil to boot?
2899 2018-10-29 18:01:50 Does anyone else get horrible anxiety getting their oil changed or is it just me 
2900 2018-10-29 18:01:50 vitamin e oil or jojoba oil
2901 2018-10-29 18:01:36 five below is undefeated. i got a wireless keyboard, 10 foot charging cable, oil diffuser, & a few new apartment decorations for $30 
2902 2018-10-29 18:01:34 @realDonaldTrump No one doubts that so far we have succeeded in implementing the sanctions, about 1.5 million barrels of Iranian oil has been cut off and this is a great victory for us, but I'm not always well convinced, I always love Our result is great.
2903 2018-10-29 18:01:27 I can't believe there are men out there who can't change a tire, oil or do basic handymen shit in a house
2904 2018-10-29 18:01:10 Still don't understand how you use oil products to treat acne 
2905 2018-10-29 18:00:56 Yeah, until I hit 40 I didn’t rely on lotion so much. Now, I need buckets of the good stuff with hemp seed oil or I lose my mind this time of year
2906 2018-10-29 18:00:52  some say castor oil, is giving this fake hair a break
2907 2018-10-29 18:00:49 @iamhakeemt man get the oil?
2908 2018-10-29 18:00:45 I mean Clark is a pretty bland guy. I bet he takes oil and vinegar on his salads cause ranch is just to saucy for him.

2918 2018-10-29 18:00:00 Learnt today that the interior is full of oil.
2919 2018-10-29 17:59:53 i only cleanse my face twice a week and then wash with water and put witch hazel/tea tree oil on blemishes on the other days and since i’ve been doing that i haven’t had a single pimple and my blemishes are virtually gone and my self esteem is 
2920 2018-10-29 17:59:50 I mix cocoa butter shea butter skin so soft and coconut oil..I mean I'll be shining like a new penny when I go to bed at night and then get up and put in body butter in the morning.

2922 2018-10-29 17:59:47 In her defense, she was only stating the newspaper's headline.  It appears she was making no judgement of her own.
2923 2018-10-29 17:59:44 No! Don't take it back, or we can't call you the "oil money plastic team". Oh too late late. Soz.

2926 2018-10-29 17:59:28 Thanks, I do.  a couple. One for leaf is on the fritz. I'm sure it's just my novice.  I've been using oil vape. Whatever it's called.  so many versions now. In my day is was joints and brownies lol
2927 2018-10-29 17:59:11 Looks like Ali went home to Canada this weekend and Overdosed on the CBD oil....lolo

2929 2018-10-29 17:58:16 No. Please. Just fry it upside down in a pan with a bit of oil. It tastes SO much better. Just... Not like this.

2933 2018-10-29 17:58:04 just used a lush bath oil that was way more glittery than anticipated... currently a walking disco ball 
2934 2018-10-29 17:58:01 The time has come for AGI to set up the "local content exploitation fund" (LCEF), & list on the exchange, so that LCEF can own the shares in natural resource assets that are usually farmed out to cronies of senior politicians. The 5% stake in oil and mineral rights come to mind.
2935 2018-10-29 17:57:52 This ACV toner, AHA serum and almond oil routine is working wonders for my burn scars 
2936 2018-10-29 17:57:51 I mean, I think, Broccoli, melted cheese, egg and bacon ... is a pretty awesome sounding morning to your diet. But like yeah, no dressing on your salad. Oil and vinegar. Ya gotta compromise.

2939 2018-10-29 17:57:21 Get into the real world, we will need oil and gas for many years to come when all those wind farms will need renewing.
2940 2018-10-29 17:57:12 Look. Iran will be bombed to smittens. US will acknowledge 400k deaths, there will be 3 million in total. Most of its population will try to take refuge to Europe, which should keep those bad allies busy. Israel will cheer, US will take control of oil pits. Sounds like a plan?
2941 2018-10-29 17:57:10 But don't get me started on fluoride. Drinking fluoride doesn't protect our teeth and causes brain damage. I use baking soda/hydrogen peroxide mix with peppermint essential oil for toothpaste. So much better for my teeth!
2942 2018-10-29 17:57:08 hey those things are hard to roll correctly.
2943 2018-10-29 17:56:59 Mas tahimik mas walang ingay.
2944 2018-10-29 17:56:52 Whale oil again?
2945 2018-10-29 17:56:46 I think that’s a fascinatingly simple concept made into a great product but for $80 I’d rather use a flattened Amazon box
2946 2018-10-29 17:56:46 Kind of, but only the skin. A roast potato is peeled after all, and blanched to fluff up the outside / edges, so that the fat can penetrate the bare potato and fry more. Oil / salt on the skin of potato crisps the skin, but it has to bake on high for a good hour, without burning

2948 2018-10-29 17:56:27 If you could try CBD Oil. Would you?
2949 2018-10-29 17:56:23 Basta sakin kahit oil pastel lang yung 36 colors.

2953 2018-10-29 17:56:10 Was reading an article, an economist's perspective? predicting peak oil within next 10-15 years...but NOT peak supply.  Peak demand.  That within the next 10-15 years oil demand will drop.  And, perhaps, precipitously.
Let's hope it's accurate and your FNRs get greenlit quickly
2954 2018-10-29 17:56:07 yep , couple of starters, 1/2 doz alternators, oil cooler, HP oil pump seals, 6 sets of tires, 3 sets of batteries & glow plugs is all I had to do it it. Have yet to change a u-joint on it -  I have never seen such longevity in u-joints, ever.
2955 2018-10-29 17:55:46 Public health professor to undergraduate class: I see no way out. Switching to electric cars, we still need the oil to make the benzene that makes the styrene and resins that make the Tesla
2956 2018-10-29 17:55:40 ..but family separation will be moot if the wall is built and reduces illegal family crossings.

Destroying environment I presume because Trump encouraging oil development? Or is it something else you have in mind?
2957 2018-10-29 17:55:32 Sounds like you need an oil. I would apply morning and night. Lately I’ve been using the antioxidant facial oil by Mad Hippie.
2958 2018-10-29 17:55:24 Cool.  Now do cancer.
2959 2018-10-29 17:55:21 The key is humanity and compassion, they have NONE!
They aren’t even concerned for their grandchildren’s future survival. 
This world WILL turn toxic like a post apocalyptic wasteland without using a single nuclear weapon. Oil rigs = $$ greed = destruction.
2960 2018-10-29 17:55:21 A “healthy” keto diet should use high fiber foods (LC) and high healthy fats (olive oil, fish, avocado...). Fermented foods can be used (kefir...). This could be the best diet for our brains (and guts?)
2961 2018-10-29 17:55:13 Products from snake oil salesmen also sold well and not because people enjoyed them. There are so many reasons so your it sells well because people enjoy it, though I'm sure people do enjoy it, isn't good enough.
2962 2018-10-29 17:55:05 baby oil, LOTS of it

2966 2018-10-29 17:54:47 I hate beans. Greens, onions, and mushrooms, I eat daily.  Do sesame seeds count? I don't eat enough fruit probably.   It's fall. Make peach crisp, sub butter for coconut oil. Easy peasy and goooood.

2987 2018-10-29 17:52:44 No CO2 or NoX, but hydrogen fueled engines emit higher levels of metal rich micro-particles than diesel engines. Pretty unhealthy. Lubrication oil is the main reason for the increased emissions.

2992 2018-10-29 17:52:05 A tax break is not a subsidy! A subsidy is where they receive money from the taxpayer, just like the renewable industries. Oil and gas companies are net tax payers.
2993 2018-10-29 17:51:59 World scientists warn we are hurtling towards runaway #climate chaos, yet the Chancellor has:
- kept oil and gas tax breaks
- boosted road-building
- frozen fuel duty
- frozen passenger duty on short haul flights

2998 2018-10-29 17:51:31 No, on the contrary, olive oil makes it crispier, as it gets very hot, it fries, plus it helps the salt to stick.

•Free pass from pre-emptively invading & conquering nations for oil

That freedom, yes?
3017 2018-10-29 17:49:15 Interesting. Olive oil softens the skin and salt makes it crispier, so I guess you're after something in the middle ?

3023 2018-10-29 17:48:55 Or a country where first conquerors get it, oh, wait! First movers always benefit for investing mindshare and taking risks. It's like gravity, first jumpers get to the ground, first! Same for Oil, Goji Berries, etc.
3024 2018-10-29 17:48:51 the thinking that military suppression will provide peace is a fallacy. We went into recession basically for the oil numbers
3025 2018-10-29 17:48:44 It will definitely help with clearing up the oil. I like it. I used it twice a day. I’m trying to find a better moisturizer because I believe oil based products are clogging my pores.
3026 2018-10-29 17:48:43 If the Norwegians are worried about anything, it's what happens when the oil wells run dry. It's one of the primary reasons they offer free university to any human who shows up: They have an existential need to innovate and grow their way away from oil dependence.

3032 2018-10-29 17:47:56 My brother what will you say about Cameroon. Our fufu and eru use to be good until this French pipo came and started cooking it with too much oil and now the thing looks like shit . we don't have anything to write home about Cameroon. Education shit. Security
3033 2018-10-29 17:47:52 #Oil Watch: @EIAgov will release Oct 31 monthly US #oil output estimates for August. Quite a lot of interest to see if the big jump in July was a blip. Current estimate for Aug (based on weekly data) is 10,961m b/d (compared to 10,964m b/d in July, based on monthly data) #OOTT

In interim 2 days worth red sauce cooking with homecanned pomodoros, base of roasted garlic and onions. Only one day of the balls in sauce.

3045 2018-10-29 17:46:17 Eastern Europe was lifted from feudalism to nearly western standards in a few decades because of socialism. Venezuela was prosperous and developing under Chavez, their issues are due to the price of oil, not socialism.

3054 2018-10-29 17:45:20 This is Saudi Arabia. Do you think they'll care? Piss them off and they'll just up the oil prices or cut the supply to certain countries.

THAT!!!

3113 2018-10-29 17:37:29 120 yrs ago, snake oil salesmen sold sketchy, dangerous elixirs to fix every malady or illness. Eventually “fake medicine” was recognized, denounced and regulated (mostly) out of existence - AMA FDA etc. 

Which leaders have the vision & authority to build the modern equivalent?
3114 2018-10-29 17:37:27 insults, refers to Latin America, ignores the 70's 80's oil crisis (and the inflation for all the world), ignores the "scala mobile" where salaries grew the same as inflation, ignores the past where without price stability unemployment was... half! A perfect slave of the markets.

3121 2018-10-29 17:36:43 I decided to eat first. Just kidding.
Seriously, I have no clue but I reckon there are several factors:
1) Venezuela became a warning signal early on
2) As you said, Venezuela had much more oil and its price fluctuations had a bigger impact
as for Brazil, not sure

3127 2018-10-29 17:36:00 Angela Merkel is stepping down. Not a surprise. The US has removed subsidies to foreign growth. Cutting corporate tax rates, deregulating, pushing on tariffs, forcing payments to NATO, and producing more oil. All this undermines foreign leaders power and creates forces for change

3158 2018-10-29 17:32:00 I’ll go ahead and take everyone’s oil... I mean liberate everyone. Yeah. Liberate.
3159 2018-10-29 17:31:55 That's what it's gonna take. Otherwise the plan is to lock all industrialized country's borders, drill the oil, and watch the world go down to global warming cataclysms, waiting for the rapture. Not joking.
3160 2018-10-29 17:31:52 It doesn't take rocket science to know what's best for your kids!

People everywhere are giving CBD oil to their children who are suffering from real severe health issues and seeing great results.

There's always going to be $omeone from big pharma who wants you to be afraid.

3167 2018-10-29 17:31:03 Our oil and gas should be in Scots hands.

Our Scotch Whisky Duty should be in Scots hands.

Money owed after bleeding generations of Scots wealth into Westminsters coffers dressed up as Tory generosity.

Our fishing should be in Scots hands.

SNHS is safer out of Tory hands.

3169 2018-10-29 17:31:01 Anthony, you put alot in here about cbd oil, I'm thinking of getting some, which is the best brand or type to go with 
3170 2018-10-29 17:30:49 I'm sure the reasoning especially in the middle East was to get full access to the valuable oil fields & mineral deposits, plus their religious war that has being going on since before the time of Christ. He was a Muslim brotherhood & he got the keys to the castle. TRAITOROUS in

3175 2018-10-29 17:30:21 Considering the paint on the train, I guess that it might be used in Togo, before we purchase it as scrap bcos then, we don't invest on Nigeria infrastructure unless on some politicians pocket despite the oil boom. Now that Buhari, is invest on it u keep wailing. Haba!

3177 2018-10-29 17:30:07 Police intelligence says transformer oil is used in preparation of some roadside fast foods, we're just lucky no one wants us all dead...yet.
3178 2018-10-29 17:30:01 Good point, I tend to believe that without an oil embargo, he'd have done better.  I think he was a much better POTUS than generally considered, like GHW Bush, also not re-elected.  In a capitalist economy, "conspicuous consumption" is what it is all about for the most part.
3179 2018-10-29 17:29:55 A barrel of oil costs less to buy than gram of legal weed.

Pointless industry
3180 2018-10-29 17:29:52 People are proposing the claim industries such as coal and oil are raising global temperatures. I invite them to Birmingham this January, and feel how warm it is not.
#pshh
3181 2018-10-29 17:29:46 Somehow, owning a billion dollar oil refining empire = not elite.
I guess its those Kansas plains values of buying a political party outright that just says 'ordinary folk' to fellow conservatives.
3182 2018-10-29 17:29:24 Tell that to the millions who lived - before oil/gas was discovered...!!
3183 2018-10-29 17:29:24 I was in oil and I am out for good.

3188 2018-10-29 17:28:26 Russia/Putin is trying to be amicable to every party. Though $5 billion investment and a small arms contract signed last year are not significant for either RU or the KSA, just a tiny symbol. SY and oil price coordination are probably the main reason/bargain matter/driving force.
3189 2018-10-29 17:28:08 I changed the oil in my little Toro single stage snowblower this morning.  It was a lotta work.... I'm exhausted ... I need a nap ... gotta convince the 5 yr old to nap with me... bet i can't

3193 2018-10-29 17:27:36 You actually don't need any kind of oil if you stir them frequently enough.
3194 2018-10-29 17:27:27 Much of the world’s oil and goods are shipped through two chokepoints: the Strait of Hormuz (bordered by Iran) and the Strait of Malacca (near China and connecting the Indian and Pacific Oceans).

Time to find some new snake oil to sell

3209 2018-10-29 17:25:45 Canada's oil and gas sector created only about 16,500 new jobs between 2000 to 2011, the same period in which 520,000 manufacturing jobs were lost.
3210 2018-10-29 17:25:41 That’s about the life of an oil field worker

3212 2018-10-29 17:25:35 The power is with the people, not with the few who oil their hands. Thank you @JerotichSeii
3213 2018-10-29 17:25:33 not going away anytime soon since the oil industry is huge...I think it will take at least 5 more years before some of them going under

3216 2018-10-29 17:25:21 Thank you for the education. Can you explain to twitter what impact the Saudi trade embargo on Qatar has on us. The Nuclear Agreement being cancelled with Iran, going back to trade embargos, making Saudi the main Oil producer? How this infact affects inflation.
3217 2018-10-29 17:25:16 هل كان ذلك باختياري في سوء فطرتي واخلاقي ايها العادل الامين هههه هذه هي الحقيقة لا يمكن ان يتحقق العدل ابدا اتحداك ان يتحقق العدل بفهمنا نحن له الا اذا فسرناه كما يريد الله لنا ان نكون بمعنى ان ما نراه ظلما قد يكون عدلا هذا فوق قدرتي وقدرتك على فهمه

3220 2018-10-29 17:25:11 @rinahsh @Behind_Reality just found out for my insurance companies pharmacist, of all places, that CBD oil is a blood thinner. I'm beginning to think there's nothing this stuff can't do.
3221 2018-10-29 17:25:09 The third "plat". It's cod cooked with olive oil, and with vegetables. And dessert, you can never be wrong with brownies :)
3222 2018-10-29 17:25:02 That hot oil massage i got from my bf was the bestttt
3223 2018-10-29 17:24:57 Haha that one wants Castor oil 
3224 2018-10-29 17:24:53 I feel for you.
Things that work for me:
1. Coconut oil
2. Aloe Vera straight from leaves
3. Babo Botanicals products (the baby moisturizer is great)
4.After shower don’t wait for more than 3 min to moisturize. That locks in water. 
Good luck!
3225 2018-10-29 17:24:46 Our economy migjt be entering a recession based on events south of the border, oil is hovering around 70$ a barrel. He might not be the best PM ever but Conservative tax cuts and anti-immigrant rhetoric is not the answer.

I'm taking orders now.
Inbox me if you need to purchase.
3227 2018-10-29 17:24:26 I love essential oils! I use clove oil topically if I ever have a toothache. I diffuse eucalyptus & peppermint for a stuffy nose, a citrus blend in the morning to perk me up, a sleep blend at night to calm me down, and an antiseptic blend during fall/winter to keep germs away!

3231 2018-10-29 17:24:02 Yep he likes to keep trying so he does
3232 2018-10-29 17:23:56 Yes, he did some things wrong when his reign was threatened... but all this happened because he was putting the US petro dollar monopoly in jeopardy. He wanted Lybian oil to be sold in gold dinars, just like Saddam wanted to sell oil in € and the came up with WMD.
3233 2018-10-29 17:23:46 Cute ba ana source of oil
3234 2018-10-29 17:23:39 Somebody has a mission
3235 2018-10-29 17:23:29 Unknown origin is oil that is not landed ie directly onto tankers. Tax revenue from this is accounted for in GERS.

2 beautiful headlights in d front
2 great bumpers at the back.

3246 2018-10-29 17:22:26 Today is great exhibit of the ocean-sized gap btw oil and corn industries. How can they agree on policy prescriptions, when they can't agree on the facts?
3247 2018-10-29 17:22:18 Soak it with oil
3248 2018-10-29 17:22:10 Ty girly! I didn’t think of coconut oil!

3253 2018-10-29 17:21:02 What’s a job that people do outside the oil sands tho? I feel like there’s bus drivers n doctors but there ain’t no in between
3254 2018-10-29 17:20:49 Funny thing is these are often the same people who give their kids CBD oil for just about any ailment, even without any sort of data.
3255 2018-10-29 17:20:49 هذا يدل على فساد فطرتك وسوء أخلاقك عندما ترى بأن الضلم شيء طبيعي ويمكن تبريره . العدل من القيم الكبرى في الحياة وبدونه يسقط كل شيء .
3256 2018-10-29 17:20:39 It looks like the tech, oil, insurance and some developers have hijacked your city.
3257 2018-10-29 17:20:39 put teatree oil on it every night, it smells really bad but it works so good
3258 2018-10-29 17:20:36 That's not to say there's not good parts. But things like gun damage stats and gun maintenance that amounts to just buying gun oil doesn't really lead to interesting gameplay.

3261 2018-10-29 17:20:17 A visibly sick Rick Santorum informs President Trump that Russian oil executives are double agents. The butler slowly gets undressed.
3262 2018-10-29 17:20:15 We all know a brown guy who has more oil in their hair than Saudi Arabia does
3263 2018-10-29 17:19:48 They are building a Beverly tire that is literally on the other side of peoples fences. The houses on Little John do not even extend over to where the back of Canadian tire will be. Everything is contained by oil water separator’s I don’t see the issue.
3264 2018-10-29 17:19:47 Think again, do some research. It's just Kerotin and bones. It's snake oil, it does not save lives. This is causing the extinction and  suffering of these majestic creatures - extinction is final.
3265 2018-10-29 17:19:31 This is how we get argan oil
3266 2018-10-29 17:19:22 Better to compare a full load Camry no? 

Regardless, this is the math that will destroy oil companies. Ppl just waking up to this reality.  Can't happen soon enough.

3271 2018-10-29 17:18:46 Les régionalismes en –oille [ɔj] sont courant en Suisse romande, où ils sont issus du francoprovençal (que j'écris volontairement sans trait-d'union). Ils ont parfois des équivalents en –ouille en usage dans les cantons de tradition d’oïl. En voici quelques-uns...
3272 2018-10-29 17:18:41 I've got a monster of a cold!  I have now got a permanent stench of olbas oil and tissues...
3273 2018-10-29 17:18:31 Let them increase, oil prices increased and we haven't died
3274 2018-10-29 17:18:30 The oil tanker of the media may just be slowly starting to turn more pro Remain. Trouble is it's taken two years + and we have only months left.
3275 2018-10-29 17:18:26 Bareminerals Oil Obsessed! I’m addicted!
3276 2018-10-29 17:18:24 Going to get an oil change should NOT take up this much time...

3281 2018-10-29 17:18:00 ملاحظة مهمة:

3282 2018-10-29 17:17:40 @Conservatives Just wondering how large the road signs 'Brought To You By Scottish Oil' will be, in the thirty billion revamp? One every mile or two will be sufficient #ToryDross
3283 2018-10-29 17:17:25 The penne with olive oil , feta and ham sounds good
3284 2018-10-29 17:17:23 Believe it or not, if you have an ecofriendly car, you may find your air filters, motors, and fuel injector wiring destroyed by rodents!  Honda, e.g. uses resins from soy, rice husks, corn, castor oil, agave.  Kia and Toyota too,  The vanilla smell attracts squirrels who eat away
3285 2018-10-29 17:17:17 And a glug of olive oil  ;)
3286 2018-10-29 17:17:10 They have a castor oil and green tea one now lol. They have a whole line of different ones to choose from. I always switch back and fourth between the castor oil one and the original blue one tho.
3287 2018-10-29 17:17:02 Quick thoughts about the Medieval, feudal Despots of Saudi Arabia:

Take your filthy oil and shove it.

Come to think of it, take Trump & his Nazis with you
3288 2018-10-29 17:16:59 What the #Budget2018 means for Scotland: £150m for the Tay Cities Deal – less than the £200m promised by the Scot Gov’t Talks ongoing over the Borderlands and Ayrshire Growth Deal Talks to begin over a Moray Growth Deal No changes to tax regime for North Sea Oil and Gas

3294 2018-10-29 17:16:15 @gibranrr Felicidades, van ganando  Morgan Stanley… We are downgrading Mexico from Overweight to Underweight 
•The main reason behind our downgrade is asymmetric risks in the short-term (i.e. airport referendum and USMCA approval) and a complicated outlook for oil production.

3299 2018-10-29 17:15:54 Used beard oil for the first time today. It’s pumpkin seed oil based so now my face smells like fall.

3308 2018-10-29 17:15:03 JFC. I spend Sundays with a friend with that horrible disease and no oil is going to fix him.
3309 2018-10-29 17:14:17 Oil is supposed to seal moisture in but it’s not a moisturizer in itself 
3310 2018-10-29 17:14:14 actually Rubio's campaign is funded by oil & gas. WSPA is trying to buy this seat.
3311 2018-10-29 17:13:55 have you tried cooking oil? That sometimes works!
3312 2018-10-29 17:13:51 This oil is good for that ....  Or a cbd thc salve

3316 2018-10-29 17:13:40 a very good question,and many of their states are oil rich too
3317 2018-10-29 17:13:29 This is shocking.. we need country’s economy , banking, jobs and oil crisis  to be solved first. Industry, Academia and Societyvshould come forward and help shift to create a an enabling environment.
3318 2018-10-29 17:13:26 Why did the heads of the oil producing companies in Alberta stand with Premier Notley and agree to a carbon tax plan? It's a dangerous slippery slope to be in bed with a premier. Pragmatism: does the end really justify the means? Citizens borrow money to pay Alberta's debt?
3319 2018-10-29 17:13:22 hi um is an oil change supposed to be $80 sksksk like uhhh bitch did I just get scammed
3320 2018-10-29 17:13:11 Huh? It would be easy to make a keto diet loaded with veg oil: it's fat. And PUFA are more ketogenic than SFA. It's not like it was funded by Nabisco or something.

3326 2018-10-29 17:11:57 This why I don’t like getting oil changes 
3327 2018-10-29 17:11:56 Believe it or not, as an old white woman, there isn’t anything that resolves “ashy skin” permanently.  I have almond oil permanently placed in my budget!!!

3330 2018-10-29 17:11:48 America is energy independent and the world's no. 1 oil and gas producer, yet we're still kowtowing to the Saudi's like the gas lines from the 70s might come back. It's strategically dumb, and Trump has done nothing to stop the stupid.

How can @JustinTrudeau be this much of a fuckup?
3333 2018-10-29 17:11:37 Try rubbing peppermint oil on your temples and neck. Or if anything take some Excedrin. Peppermint oil and Excedrin work wonders for me whenever I have a migraine

3341 2018-10-29 17:10:55 Oh well, we all have billionaires whose influence we fear & loathe. I alternate between the Koch brothers (whose dad got his business stake from Papa Joe Stalin after building the Nazis an oil refinery) & the God-Awful Mercer family. Plenty of monsters with pots of money.

3345 2018-10-29 17:10:30 One world government sounds awesome! No borders, religions practiced in peace, no need to make bargains with corrupt governments for oil and other resources...perfect!
3346 2018-10-29 17:10:18 Ahhh.... Very interesting !!!!     I actually eat this oil ... It is very thick like peanut butter when done ...  I simply put 1 gram in my mouth or in a smoothie and drink it down...   JMO stands for Justin Marshall Oil ...   Since this recipe is quite different than RSO
3347 2018-10-29 17:10:14 Gone are those days when people will do kwanan gida and collect oil blocs as payment.
3348 2018-10-29 17:10:10 R.I.P the oil
3349 2018-10-29 17:10:09 Isn't that the world price for oil. I thought that Canadian oil was going for around 26 bucks a barrel.

3355 2018-10-29 17:09:40 Plains Midstream has been moving Oil back and forth across the border for years. So it’s not new. And only economic for Producers that have assets close to the border. Also read on the weekend that Keystone is supposed to start construction in Spring ‘19 ?

And Cuba buys oil from Venzeuala already. 

Oh well there's still Burma and Eritria those economic powerhouses to splash cash on Iranian oil.

"I don't spill (food), I decorate."

The German is actually funnier because "kleckern" can be used in many context: be messy with food, while painting, changing oil etc.

However, wars fought because of off shore oil fields, like VN, and for no reason I understand like the bombing of Yemen seem terribly wrong to me. Do you think I am wrong?

3410 2018-10-29 17:03:13 Also, doesn't it seem counter-intuitive to encourage investment in a country other than yours?  Canada needs investment.  Build an Oil refinery! Build a lumber refinery!  Stop giving it all away to other countries.
3411 2018-10-29 17:03:12 It appears that the use of USD as a global reserve currency has reached the end and the transition to a currency basket in international trade is in process.  I do not know how the UST continues to float, but when oil is exchanged in Yuan and Euro there is less demand for UST.

3418 2018-10-29 17:02:05 Drugs can be very toxic for people and wildlife, even in low doses. We do not put used motor oil or leftover paint thinner in the trash, why put these extremely potent pharmaceutical chemicals into unsecure curbside trash cans.
3419 2018-10-29 17:01:56 It's a v. personal thing, but something that is readily available*, portable for crisis & is calming (eg lavender oil?) or ideally connects to a soothing, safe memory/ time of life. Such a powerful sensory route often overlooked- quickest route to brain.
3420 2018-10-29 17:01:55 You have to remember Glazers & Ed's marketing strategies have given the club 'more' money, it's a PLC not an oil rich backed club.

3426 2018-10-29 17:01:25 NYT: Why not smear Cruz.
His support for cutting ACA, Medicare + Social Security.

His general support for Trump's nation-destroying right-wing extremist.

Cruz's voting for everything which would benefit the Mercer fam, Oil + Gas cos. Also against anything for the working class.

If Liberal Thought was magically wiped our troubles would be few.

Nigeria earned $119.8 billion from 1990 to 1998, $481 billion from 1999 to 2009 and $381 billion from 2010 to 2014, while present administration has only earned $112 billion from June 2015.
The earnings from oil from 2010 to 2014 were the highest recorded.

3467 2018-10-29 16:57:17 IF (as you say) 100% of oil tax revenue is sent to Scotland then how does that square with your theory that "revenue was used for services", do you mean services within Scotland? So the UKGov pay companies to extract oil while Scotland gets 100% of what the UK deems fit to charge

Processing from plants to product requires energy and chemicals... from OIL.

It would be cheaper and more practical to make the cup from oil

Minced fresh green chillies. 

Fry off for 2-3 min, then seal the chicken portions in this oil/herb mixture. (Small Thighs work best)

3487 2018-10-29 16:55:49 q el gas y el oil lo producen las rocas madres se sabe desde siempre. No lo "descubrió nadie recientemente" .
La razon de la extraccion de shale es puramente comercial. 
Cuando bajaron los costos de produccion, gracias a experiencias en USA las rocas madres pasaron a ser objetivo
3488 2018-10-29 16:55:47 He doesn't need to increase duty, the rise in oil prices has done that for him!  He should increase duty however to encourage greener travel ! Not seeing that here
3489 2018-10-29 16:55:36 I think the gas shortage was in the early 70s maybe 73 or 4 during the oil embargo. I was too young to drive and road my bike everywhere. Didn't impact me.
3490 2018-10-29 16:55:36 This guy was talking to me while I was waiting for an oil change and I slyly dropped that I was married into the convo and he goes “Oh I’m not hitting on you I just wanted to tell you that your sweatpants are ripped but I needed to build a repor first.” K thanks buddy.

Also, a massive oil fund sure helps

3552 2018-10-29 16:48:20 lavender oil
3553 2018-10-29 16:48:17 I borrow at 5% to invest in an oil rig, consumer price inflation is 2%, oil prices go down with 10%. but wages are stable. What's my 'real' interest rate?
3554 2018-10-29 16:48:11 Did you no see that we're to be a state of the art toxic waste dump? Oil decommissioning centre. WHOOP-de-do.

3556 2018-10-29 16:48:04 Morgan Stanley… We are downgrading Mexico from Overweight to Underweight 
•The main reason behind our downgrade is asymmetric risks in the short-term (i.e. airport referendum and USMCA approval) and a complicated outlook for oil production in the medium-term.
3557 2018-10-29 16:48:00 Price absolutely stable for 48 hours and then a .025 cent drop in an hour and a half.

This is why TA in crypto is a joke. Sorry all you snake oil salesmen; this game is wholly unpredictable.

Buy and HODL and that's it, or risk losing your ass.
3558 2018-10-29 16:47:52 Didn’t they tar and feather snake oil salesmen at one time? Asking for a tired nation.
3559 2018-10-29 16:47:43 1 part unrefined Shea butter 1 part jojoba oil and few drops of essential oil. This works really well for hair and skin for my colorful family:)
3560 2018-10-29 16:47:40 Norway produces around twice as much oil at half the cost for a start.
3561 2018-10-29 16:47:34 Might not be presented well, nothing wrong in fresh boiled cauliflower. and finest cod cooked in a drizzle of olive oil and good pinch of salt and pepper. It’s very tasty. Just an easy quick healthy choice
3562 2018-10-29 16:47:32 No surprise. He has always been a snake oil salesman. Still is. VOTE!
3563 2018-10-29 16:47:24 On the supply side-better knowledge content fed into the public discursive spaces. On the demand side-more enlightened citizens demanding for Oil sector reforms with the passing of the PIGB.
3564 2018-10-29 16:47:19 Went to @Pennzoil 10 minute oil change to have my transmission flushed this morning. Didn’t make it a mile down the road when my transmission quit working..
3565 2018-10-29 16:47:13 Since selective memory is in play, a few FACTS on Carter from someone who lived it. CARTER-'76-'80. min.wage, 2.10 an hour. Arab oil embargo. Prime lending rate, 17%. Unemployment, 8%, FARMERS picket SOTU address. 444 DAYS, and a disasterous rescue attempt, 2 lives lost.
3566 2018-10-29 16:47:03 Indian press should mount a pressure campaign on this. We are importing billions worth of oil.
3567 2018-10-29 16:46:54 Very nice packaging.... terps are great with Distillate... make some tasty oil/vape... but I’m an old man and love me some sticky stanky bud nugs .....& Distillate 
3568 2018-10-29 16:46:54 I have to use baby oil everyday. I think if you live in a cold weather state it gets worse.
3569 2018-10-29 16:46:51 We just spoke with store manager and he helped. Overall, the communication at store level is horrible at best. They told my wife her oil change was $33 with a $10 discount, then she was charged $44  and given a $16 discount. Its only $5 but its deceptive and wrong.
3570 2018-10-29 16:46:39 Anybody ever used wild growth hair oil on their locs?
3571 2018-10-29 16:46:29 truffle warm olive oil. . .14
fried chicken (baby chowder). . .31
buttermilk chive-edamame ceviche. . .19
3572 2018-10-29 16:46:17 I’m of the small minority that don’t care that Jamie Oliver’s restaurants are doing badly because I don’t want a larger olive oil to pasta ratio.
3573 2018-10-29 16:46:13 A 14-year-long oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico verges on becoming one of the worst in U.S. history. About 18 wells leaking 700 barrels a day, and trump wants less regulations. #VoteBlueToSaveAmericanDemocracy
3574 2018-10-29 16:46:04 Please get your oil changed often. This car im working on is 53,000 miles overdue for an oil change
3575 2018-10-29 16:45:59 The herb  works faster if you use it with anointing oil and holy water

3576 2018-10-29 16:45:55 @PizzaHutIN 

I wanna switch to Pizza Hut because amount of olive oil used in your pizzas are huge! The pizza base feels slimy underneath ' because of excess olive oil. First time it happened, I thought 'It's alright.

3577 2018-10-29 16:45:51 Read the IPCC Special Report (re. effects of 1.5C increase) released 7 Oct.  Even with Paris accord limits, we are on track to hit 3C increase, which is catastrophic for many things (goodbye coral reefs!). Need to do more, sooner! @realDonaldTrump still pushing coal & oil! Idiot!
3578 2018-10-29 16:45:47 @burgerkingindia plz stop frying onions and fries in same oil. 

I Don like when my fries smells like onion. #Burgerking

3584 2018-10-29 16:45:18 You could just change the rules like they did in the 80’s eliminating 4-on-4 when the Oil used to do that on purpose to open up the ice...
3585 2018-10-29 16:45:14 And what do Arabs know .. no human rights, oil, suicide bombs, and that’s about it. Check out Nobel Prize winners, far more Jews contribute to this world and very few Muslims.

3589 2018-10-29 16:44:42 windows open, freezing dark room, ice pack on base of neck and (possibly unpopular part here) burning Olbas/Eucalyptus oil in an oil burner - I swear by this. My bf has awful chest issues and from burning this at night I realised how much it reduced my migraine pain. Feel better
3590 2018-10-29 16:44:35 Toast with crushed tomato and a little olive oil while sitting at a small cafe in Spain on the Med.
3591 2018-10-29 16:44:30 You know that UNKNOWN ORIGIN concerning MOST OF THE OIL AND GAS,,,, DON'T TRY AND LIE TO ME AS I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT NONSENSE FROM THE BRIT MSM 
OK !!!
3592 2018-10-29 16:44:19 I just spread them on the paper, drizzle with oil and put them in the oven...they dry up and get crispy. Maybe it depends on the oven setting 
3593 2018-10-29 16:44:10 Why when u go to get a simple oil change all the sudden everything's about to need to be replaced, or upgraded??  #ImNotGoingForIt
3594 2018-10-29 16:44:06 So I've spoken to the doctors and they've increased my dosage for my antidepressants. I also spoke about CBD oil and they said there shouldn't be a problem with that.

3596 2018-10-29 16:44:00 العدل هو انك امن في بيتك ياتيك رزقك وتنعم بالحياة اي بحث عن عدل اخر انما هو رفاهية بل هو انانية لانك تريد مصادرة حق الاخرين الاغلبية في قبول وضعهم الحاضر مقابل ان لديك تخيل عن عدل لا يوجد في اي مكان في العالم قديما وحديثا
3597 2018-10-29 16:43:51 @realDonaldTrump GIVE PUTIN MEDAL OF HONOR HE GOT OIL OUT OF SYRIA NOW WE GOT REASON FOR WW3.
3598 2018-10-29 16:43:37 Just wondering why we are exporting so much oil and gas and heating fuel prices are as high as they are. Can you answer that?
3599 2018-10-29 16:43:34 Have you heard of 
CBD OIL?
3600 2018-10-29 16:43:34 As long as you - Jair Bolsonaro - honor your country and do not sell Brazil at banana’s price to the US and/or send our young men to die in Venezuela at US’ request in the name of oil, I am good with this chit-chat between both of you.
3601 2018-10-29 16:43:22 Or snake oil.
3602 2018-10-29 16:43:11 I hate it when the elites target poor hardworking... oil companies
3603 2018-10-29 16:43:08 Thx for this! DXY: indeed dificult, but would agree to be ST weaker, but should catch a bid with yields moving down...so gold up, dxy up with lower yields. Interesting to see then how rest of commodities will play it ( imo down with oil). Cheers
3604 2018-10-29 16:42:59 The way Real Madrid is going down ...

3609 2018-10-29 16:42:16 Gavin would seek the "death" penalty under the previous administration who had stayed the previous orders and yet under the new regime the three black students from chevron oil engineering and other concerns now felt that their lively hood was at stake and yet as one black

3615 2018-10-29 16:41:15 Venezuela has been sanctioned by the USA which also means the EU nations also stops trading with them so can't really say if they would be in such dire situation without the sanctions. Venezuela has the 2nd largest oil reserves.

3626 2018-10-29 16:39:47 Curious how this #MAC2018 will play out? Will we find a solution for oil &gas drilling in the Arctic vs. environmental protection? And what will this ecologist learn about international relations? #MAC2018 #ArcticCouncil #rovaniemi
3627 2018-10-29 16:39:40 Our government has NEVER given a shit. Hell, we helped supply the Nazis during WWII with tanks and oil, but they don't teach your kids about that in school!!! As I said before, it is a psycho club, and the only way to defeat them is to create new systems that actually work.
3628 2018-10-29 16:39:32 AGAINST Terrorism & with a HUGE Financial CLOUT, America has ONE ally she can rely on: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The KSA has the capacity to offset any shortage brought upon the cessation of Iran's Oil Production.
3629 2018-10-29 16:39:30 And big oil should pay for it. Not the constituents of the state of Washington.

3631 2018-10-29 16:38:48 Stop being dishonest, Oil prices crashed in 2015 causing the recession. PDP was in power for 16 years under high oil prices, they didn't invest in the economy. Instead you're blaming PMB for PDPs failures please you have no case.
3632 2018-10-29 16:38:43 You know say dat one no be problem. 

When you go cook di oil rice again?


3633 2018-10-29 16:38:30 Not your Father’s Redhat, either.  And I’ve been pointing out to people, both companies have been working together for 2 decades, this isn’t like smashing oil and water together (though I can see how it might look that way to those unfamiliar)
3634 2018-10-29 16:38:28 Only way I can have them is drizzled with olive oil, sea salt and chilli flakes then nuked on the grill.

3638 2018-10-29 16:38:13 Yes should celebrate a new era at  Oil Drum Mansions! 
3639 2018-10-29 16:38:10 Y'all coach phillips ain't never changed the oil in his cart. I'm so dead rn. He's NEVER changed it. EVER 
3640 2018-10-29 16:38:02 See they could get that done in no time. I do know though that mechanics don’t get paid much for oil changes so they really don’t like doing them. It’s fucked up, but that’s how they are.
3641 2018-10-29 16:37:53 Yeah I guess, kinda! How exactly do you get them "chip like"? My Guy just lightly coats the whole leaf in olive oil, salt &  fresh garlic & bakes em. I don't really think of chips! XX

3645 2018-10-29 16:37:39 @GovCanHealth Looking for clarification as to what companies like #CFTO can & cannot do. Can CFTO LEGALLY sell to anyone in Canada post-Oct17? Do they have (& need) licencing to sell hemp-derived CBD oil to the public? I know of someone attempting to sell it through direct sales.
3646 2018-10-29 16:37:32 Talk to your doctor or try CBD oil

3649 2018-10-29 16:37:11 This is true. Saudi's are monsters. Horrible. Just saying why they're supported - because of oil and the petrodollar. Follow the fake money.

3652 2018-10-29 16:37:02 Yeah. Saw them. Army troops are positioned around that Katampe bridge to prevent them from coming into town. They're around Shema, AA Rano and Dan Oil. They've blocked the major express leading up to town. But the road heading to Kubwa is free.
3653 2018-10-29 16:36:52 I just had a conversation with a guy selling me juul pods about putting oil in it, he said might as well just buy a cart, dude was like 60 hahahahaha
3654 2018-10-29 16:36:43 Maybe I can start heating the oil when making the syrup, right? It seems like a long time to heat the oil from when I start making the dough
3655 2018-10-29 16:36:35 When the Soviet Union disbanded a lot of these guys bought Oil/Gas Fields at a discount. Inonzi cheap chaiyo that's how these oligarchs were birthed.
3656 2018-10-29 16:36:27 That’s very nice. But wouldn’t it be better if you used one of the many alternatives that aren’t palm oil?

We will turn Scotland into an oil industry decommissioning centre of excellence.

SO the taxpayer is going to pay for decommissioning private company's rigs etc and Scots people will pay some?
3662 2018-10-29 16:35:30 yes he is...least we have seen his face...bet you are a right old ugly bug on the reverse of that flag.

3664 2018-10-29 16:35:18 Nigerian protesters, Tunis bomb, all foretells an explosion in N Africa/Em geopolitical concerns which will spill into oil, expensive calls could be cheap if we get any type of blow out w no more production surprises
3665 2018-10-29 16:35:14 I am not a fan. I see another media whore with a massive ego problem. We already have a self-serving blowhard.

Time to vet candidates thoroughly. No more attention starved snake oil sales men. 

If Avenatti wants to fight in court...great. if he is eyeing the White House...no.

3668 2018-10-29 16:33:59 Incidently the induced EQs in Oklahoma (the best studied) are not from fracking itself but mostly to wastewater injection, primarily extracted from the oil field. The water comes up with the oil & is too brackish/etc to pump to a river. The injection/eq correlation is complex.
3669 2018-10-29 16:33:56 1/3 Why is that none of local channels named BYCO Petroleum Pak Ltd (BPPL) the party ordered by Balochistan's EPA. to halt its operations after a stretch of the Sindh-Balochistan coastal belt became heavily polluted due to oil spill from an underground pipeline. @AliHZaidiPTI
3670 2018-10-29 16:33:52 That's hilarious. Right here is politics. So issue 112 is for oil and gas to move lines 2500 feet from personal property. Issue 74 is to give propety owners the right to sue the government over any law that tells them what to do. amendment 74 is backed by oil and gas.
3671 2018-10-29 16:33:50 I imagine taking climate change seriously in the 1980s and ignoring the oil companies' misinformation campaigns for the next thirty years. We could've had the future we want right now, but decidedly evil capitalists got in the way.
3672 2018-10-29 16:33:49 Unless you have plenty of oil and money, don’t dare treat Violet like that. We have enough sink holes. Stand your ground girl. We are with you all the way.
3673 2018-10-29 16:33:46 With the ever-advancing leftist machine, we will reach peak oil millennia before we reach peak crazy.
3674 2018-10-29 16:33:43 Oil dips as Russia signals output will stay high...
3675 2018-10-29 16:33:37 @BBCNews no tax on fuel, allowing Oil Companies to profit from increases that they will most definitely implement now. Savings to car owners and van owners NIL
3676 2018-10-29 16:33:34 Absolutely... Afterall, the oil price won't get higher by itself, would it? Thanks for the leg up Mr. Minister... ;)
3677 2018-10-29 16:33:30 Fucking hell. Looks like I’m burning the freaking midnight oil again. Urgh.
3678 2018-10-29 16:33:19 But admits it is "Scotland's Oil and Gas Industry" !!
3679 2018-10-29 16:33:15 Freeze on fuel, freeze on beer, cider and of course whisky, no change to oil and gas taxes. Plus ca change... #Budget2018
3680 2018-10-29 16:33:08 I don’t feel like paying for an oil change. 
3681 2018-10-29 16:33:07 Punch a few holes in them first. Then rub them down with olive oil and a little kosher salt. Wrap them in foil, and put them in on high for 3-4 hours or until done. Weirdly, the inside turns kind of yellow, but they are fantastic.
3682 2018-10-29 16:33:02 Does my sassiness upset you?

’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells

3683 2018-10-29 16:32:57 Yes, ethanol/corn lobby has a lot of pull. But higher ethanol blends are good for all Americans: less smog/GHG, lower prices, less reliance on foreign oil. Re: damage, E15 approved in 90% of new cars. For > like E85, no one's forcing it on anyone. 20M flex-fuel vehicles can use.

3687 2018-10-29 16:32:15 Dozens of producers but hundreds if you include their service providers. Distress sales/bankruptcies. Many gas producers saw their revenues collapse.  Sometimes by 100% as the price of gas went to 0. Heavy oil is only a little better.
3688 2018-10-29 16:32:14 Don't be fooled by the Budget's fuel freeze. Revenues are gushing in with the high oil price.
3689 2018-10-29 16:32:14 Good afternoon traders! 
 $eurusd still sitting within the weekly demand zone so we should see some upside this week.

3764 2018-10-29 16:25:58 all of which is aggravated by the fact that some of the only well paying jobs in a lot of rural areas are part of the oil/gas industry. The only way my family can stay where they settled are high paying, high risk jobs in... the oil and gas industry!

3820 2018-10-29 16:20:03 I meant oil not glue 
3821 2018-10-29 16:19:44 As a supplement or just oil on the skin ?
3822 2018-10-29 16:19:42 Really need to get a deep conditioning & hot oil treatment in sometime this week! My hair looks and feel atrocious

3825 2018-10-29 16:19:20 Rome's glory, nevertheless it is similar stones in oil it in which it might be stretched with pearl barley gruel.
3826 2018-10-29 16:19:14 Reminder: #Washington voters, if you fill out your ballot today, MAKE SURE you vote "Yes" on I-1631. The biggest polluters (oil refineries & oil companies) are fighting tooth & nail so they can avoid paying their fair share for polluting our water & air.

We need this. #I1631
3827 2018-10-29 16:19:05 ……………いや、普通は会社に配るんじゃないのか？他のツイート見ても会社にすら任意みたいだけど……
3828 2018-10-29 16:19:04 At least #MalusiGigaba 's hand was slippery imagine if it was dry. Is that baby oil or natural oil from the snake?

3832 2018-10-29 16:18:42 I had a great dad too. He owned a service station back in the day when they checked your oil and washed your windshields. He use to give people gas that could not afford it. Or let them charge until they could.
3833 2018-10-29 16:18:38 Guys what did he put on that dick vele? Bio oil? 
3834 2018-10-29 16:18:36 Love that song Heid :)
3835 2018-10-29 16:18:16 This time around we must beat the oil marketers.
3836 2018-10-29 16:18:13 Again, it’s not the same thing as what the oil companies did and it wasn’t Obama personally investing or giving them a loan. the USA invests in oil everywhere. Look at how we deal with Saudi Arabia.
3837 2018-10-29 16:18:00 @saladworks no olive oil, just soybean oil??? Really?? You guys should be better than that!
3838 2018-10-29 16:17:57 I use olive oil daily
3839 2018-10-29 16:17:54 Use that black Jamaican castor oil boy!!!!
3840 2018-10-29 16:17:49 Reality is oil isn’t clean regardless. Canada should ban all gas/diesel vehicles like Norway but our economy is too dependent. Oil Industry needs to reinvent.
3841 2018-10-29 16:17:46 やめてくれ！ｗｗｗ
3842 2018-10-29 16:17:39 Just got a CBD oil massage, holy shit that was nice

3845 2018-10-29 16:17:19 Can any fellas give any recommendations on some beard oil or serums ? I’m trying to be someone’s dad this winter.... but sadly I’m looking like tiny Tim
3846 2018-10-29 16:17:16 Man i had a beautiful woman i was dealing with at NSU who used to braid my hair.... y’all the feeling when she would part my hair and rub the oil in my hair and scratch in between ony scalp 

I should’ve married her
3847 2018-10-29 16:17:07 my greatest flaw? I always add slightly too much olive oil when I make hummus at home
3848 2018-10-29 16:17:03 tuna salad sandwich with peppers, spinach, mustard, olive oil, tabasco, rosemary, and pepper on wheat 
3849 2018-10-29 16:16:41 From acrylics I'm switching to oil paints. New supplies are in transit. These day I' m feeling more inspired. Painting for me is morea hobby which challenges me. I buy, I hold and when I have changed my view point I sell. There are too many works with me bought20 years ago.
3850 2018-10-29 16:16:37 got a black castor oil shampoo I'm hype to try
3851 2018-10-29 16:16:14 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
3852 2018-10-29 16:16:13 LOL Looking for "DECENCY" in Grover Norquist is like drilling for oil in Zimbabwe - you might just discover a drop or two but it's not worth the effort
3853 2018-10-29 16:16:11 Y'all making fried rice without sesame oil?
3854 2018-10-29 16:16:07 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*

#cookup #differentflavor
3856 2018-10-29 16:16:03 Actually...oil, butter, and cream...sounds like I should be making a pasta dish 
3857 2018-10-29 16:16:02 @ademolaadigun Imperfect as it's, the PIGB is the only effort till date to save the oil and gas industry. The present reluctance to pass it sheer selfishness on the part of those who hold the levers of power

3860 2018-10-29 16:15:53 Senator, they are yelling at you to free this country from the shackles. Just imagine for a second if every state became like the West coast states (e.g. California, Washington) or the east coast states New England, MD, NoVA etc. Venezuela hedged her bets only on oil, hence
3861 2018-10-29 16:15:52 Nah they just use peanut oil. I don’t think my body likes that oil. 
3862 2018-10-29 16:15:46 You’re arguing with a guy that drinks glorified motor oil out of a can every day. 

That being said, give me my Lyme Dorito.
3863 2018-10-29 16:15:43 UK'S HAMMOND SAYS TAX WILL COME INTO EFFECT IN APRIL 2020 AND RAISE OVER 400 MLN STG A YEAR... and  just the beginning remember how we taxed oil companies coming to a country near you
3864 2018-10-29 16:15:35 Trudeau should have canned them. The excuse it would have cost too much was lame, considering the amount they force feed the oil and gas industry during the worst crisis humanity has ever faced.
3865 2018-10-29 16:15:19 if your beard is thinner than you’d like, lightly combing castor oil through it @ night should help within a couple of weeks
3866 2018-10-29 16:15:18 Ah sha tinotobvunzisisa isu. Be ready to defend it. If these were spiritual claims dai tisingabvunze, just like anointing oil munongoita pasina anobvunza.

3868 2018-10-29 16:14:40 Like RSS invited Pranabda to Nagpur, Modi may invite Kim Jong Un North Korean President or the Iranian Ayatollah to insult Trump and buy cheap oil.
3869 2018-10-29 16:14:36 Price of oil has a lot to do with certain. Countries wealth and expenditures at the moment i believe its ten dollars to high and will slow a lot of countries growth

3880 2018-10-29 16:13:23 You cannot tax your way to Prosperity. We are highly susceptible to economic shock due to our reliance on oil.  We have a "small" economy
3881 2018-10-29 16:13:08 Maybe (don’t quote me lol) you can use an oil to loosen the wefts. I’m talking heavy duty, Olive Oil. Massage it through the cap

3883 2018-10-29 16:12:45 Move your face oil to your ankles
3884 2018-10-29 16:12:45 Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s misconduct is the focus of 14 federal investigations, the most in department history, all while he continues to enrich corporate polluters by selling out millions of acres of America’s iconic public lands to the oil and gas industry.

3886 2018-10-29 16:12:42 Sorry about that.
Palm oil rice spoils way too fast.
3887 2018-10-29 16:12:38 Of course they aren't. How else would GM get kick-backs from the gas & oil industry along with their massive tax cuts?  /s
3888 2018-10-29 16:12:37 Maybe ur fine when the World Famous Economist left behind a huge Oil Bill 2 pay which this govt. paid back. Black money continues 4 its the deep rooted legacy of INC which will take time 2 uproot. A bill as big as GST will hv no amendments u mean? haha
3889 2018-10-29 16:12:33 Dear spm candidates, this is the best time for us to burn the midnight oil! If we work hard starting from now, anything can be possible. Inshaallah  

May Allah ease everything for all of us 
3890 2018-10-29 16:12:27 add oil! you can do it!
3891 2018-10-29 16:12:04 والله إن نيتي إني أنبه للظلم اللي حاصل في مقتل #جمال_خاشقجي وللبنتين رحمهما الله تعالي ، ولم يكن في نيتي على الإطلاق الإستهانة بما حصل لهما .

3893 2018-10-29 16:12:00 I told my dad I want an oil change for my birthday. That’s how things are going :)
3894 2018-10-29 16:11:43 I doubt Hammond knows where Wales is and now that North Sea oil has been frittered away, never mind Scotland.  (His view, not mine, I hasten to add.)
3895 2018-10-29 16:11:39 this weather makes me want to be a better person. go to class? yes. brush my hair? yes. do my homework? yes. workout? yes. smile at strangers? yes. get my oil changed? yes.

3897 2018-10-29 16:11:38 my dad said that harry couldn’t save our economy and three seconds later he spilled boiling oil on his face harry’s impact!! (don’t worry sjsks he’s okay)

3900 2018-10-29 16:11:15 That was actually under ford he had the oil embargo which we capitulated and paid their prices.
3901 2018-10-29 16:11:09 Hickenlooper is political poison. He caters to oil & gas fracking

3906 2018-10-29 16:10:20 I think this man just paid $482 for an oil change, wiper blades and a filter on his truck. Didn’t even flinch. Oil was $17 bucks a quart. Here I am mad I had to pay $44 for my Groupon oil change.
3907 2018-10-29 16:10:14 Another question is whether it is coincidental that it's the Russian oil industry who stand to lose the most from switch to low sulphur. They are unprepared and are an exporter of high sulphur. His intervention is unconnected?
3908 2018-10-29 16:10:04 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
3909 2018-10-29 16:09:59 Do you oil and balm as well? Yours looks curly (like mine) I have to oil, balm and then blow dry whilst combing. Have you any secrets?

3912 2018-10-29 16:09:49 Baby oil, conditioner or the hair glue removal stuff
3913 2018-10-29 16:09:42 @arunjaitley Sir buyers credit is stopped. The cost of finance to import raw material for manufacturing & export has gone up. The Furnace Oil cost has doubled due to weakening of rupee the cost can't e passed on to consumers kindly help small industry  we r finished.

3928 2018-10-29 16:08:54 Everyone is posting their Halloween pics and costumes and I get to dress up as an oil rig worker, every day, waking up at 4am included
3929 2018-10-29 16:08:50 เลยว่าจะไปรถทัวร์แถวๆนี้เอาค่ะ ไป-กลับง่ายดี
3930 2018-10-29 16:08:48 wangi jugak tapi tak kuat sangat sbb dia dari ingredients natural, argan oil and banyak lagi
3931 2018-10-29 16:08:34 You can always use an oil to soften it up but also you should go to the store you bought it from and tell them you got a defected one and if it’s online email the customer service  I’m sure you’ll get it replaced ! Abh dipbrow pomades are amazing ! Trust 
3932 2018-10-29 16:08:32 Once again the far left wants us dependent on Middle East oil.
3933 2018-10-29 16:08:30 My poor ass self can't see the petroleum jelly so i put virgin coconut oil to my cracked side lips. Spell desperation.
3934 2018-10-29 16:08:13 Methinks he is just trying to counter that other prophet’s claim of oil in Zim.
3935 2018-10-29 16:08:10 eye cream, face cream, body lotion, coconut oil.  us whiteys know the drill, too.  skin should come with a built-in pump of lotion.
3936 2018-10-29 16:08:06 CBD oil for sure! We use it, and we love it!
3937 2018-10-29 16:08:02 -_- انا سعودي ي محمد
3938 2018-10-29 16:07:57 I love Midland TX, oil rigs guys, welders, love to pay women for their services. Use to Service men there 3yrs ago when the oil boom was going down and they was laying off oil rig men from their job.
3939 2018-10-29 16:07:53 the analyticals man with the FULL BLESSING of the manager of that BOY BAND has been OFFICIALLY LINKED with big oil
3940 2018-10-29 16:07:51 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
3941 2018-10-29 16:07:35 PXD's claims have always been ethically questionable. I worry more when GOR DECREASES b/c that means no more reservoir energy. Despite bad business model, shale is no Ponzi scheme. When shale fails to deliver, govts will take over & nationalize b/c oil's too important to fail.
3942 2018-10-29 16:07:35 Interesting that Russian Oil industry stand to lose the most from IMO2020. Unprepared for low sulphur.
3943 2018-10-29 16:07:31 Use palm oil
3944 2018-10-29 16:07:30 หนูว่าจะไปเครื่องบิน แต่ขี้เกียจเข้าเมือง
3945 2018-10-29 16:07:26 I rushed home to eat this palm oil rice. 

Alas. It's spoiled.  Inside fridge o!

Thank you NEPA or whatever the f**k you're called now.
3946 2018-10-29 16:07:21 How much oil do we produce and how much do we need as a country?
3947 2018-10-29 16:07:07 The media URGENTLY needs a wake up call, BUT how is it that in NSW fuel prices jump 20c per litre in one day and in the ACT they are pretty stable for 6 months plus?
NOW THERE REQUIRES INVESTIGATION. Why not do what Pres Trump is doing and bring the oil companies back home?
3948 2018-10-29 16:07:03 if you can’t back a trailer, drive stick, change your oil, and change a tire you’re more of a bitch than me & i don’t want you
3949 2018-10-29 16:06:58 Good piont.. All the countries with massive militaries going to give us the data? Noooo.. Sell the Saudis 15B in military eqip. Then buy there oil? Like I said fuk all in this gov makes sense.. Hypocrisy gone amuck.
3950 2018-10-29 16:06:34 Oil
3951 2018-10-29 16:06:21 Fracking on federal lands terribly upsetting. This properties are pristine lands and some contain artifacts and were previously Native American grounds. Trump is destroying last untouched America. Why is this happening. The big oil is going in destroying Beautiful America. Stop!
3952 2018-10-29 16:06:18 //พูดแล้วจะร้องไห้
3953 2018-10-29 16:06:06 Guna bio oil. Kena istiqamah ah sikit mmg take times . Carik kat drugstore. Okay dah
3954 2018-10-29 16:05:51 But more seriously, coconut oil usually does the trick, or a really warm rag and some soap
3955 2018-10-29 16:05:46 @Lowetide I know the Oil are on an amazing streak, BUT, why do PPL go berzerk when I point out McD/RNH are not producing 5x5 with MiniMe56 as the other wing? JP96 has as many points/shots playing with #18 (who has ZERO points). Why doesn't he get a push?
3956 2018-10-29 16:05:28 僕は性犯罪何度か受けてるけど、性犯罪ってされる側からすると、性犯罪する人間＝犯罪を犯罪と認識してないから簡単に犯罪を犯すような人間＝最悪の場合人○しまでをする人間である可能性がある、と解釈するので、太刀打ちするにはよくて相討ちの覚悟で立ち向かわなきゃいけないと思ってる

3958 2018-10-29 16:05:20 If its from God, the anointing oil is as good as the new medicine
3959 2018-10-29 16:05:15 The biggest mistake of USA is supporting Saudi Wahabis and ISIL.
Once their Oil run out, what will they do on USA?
3960 2018-10-29 16:05:14 Yes.
And @larry_kudlow is selling the snake oil that the market is collapsing in fear of Democrats taking control of the House.
3961 2018-10-29 16:05:05 Oil available 
3962 2018-10-29 16:04:49 A big reason for all this discord is so that fracking, Arctic oil exploration, arms sales, deficit military spending, dangerous mining, and ignoring climate science can all go unchecked. #resist
3963 2018-10-29 16:04:47 And oil and mining and manufacturing in internationally traded goods.  Evraz Steel runs electric furnaces in the Regina pipe plant.  The whole plant is likely to be moved.
3964 2018-10-29 16:04:46 He is young and one could argue shouldn’t have been here to begin with. The rush to bring a player up quickly has burnt the oil a number of times.  Send him down let him play
3965 2018-10-29 16:04:36 المفروض هذا تعليقك من البداية ...
3966 2018-10-29 16:04:32 I mean, Brown sold some gold... But Maggie sold the oil, telecoms, energy and social homes. Which rose in price more? #Budget2018
3967 2018-10-29 16:04:30 There is a high level of hot oil floating in the air at all times from all those frying bangers
3968 2018-10-29 16:04:26 MY GOD, KO MATER SPEI GO NKGA DI ANOINTING OIL LE DI WACHO. BLESS YOUR CHILDREN, EXAM E A BA NYEDISA.
3969 2018-10-29 16:04:14 My formula for success? Rise early, work late, strike oil.
成功の秘訣？ 早起きすること、遅くまで働くこと、油田を掘り当てることさ。
3970 2018-10-29 16:03:58 US oil prod business model largely precludes it from such a position. As much as purists, and opportunists, lament OPEC+, they do the dirty work of mkt control that Western ethos both spurns, and demands. Reminiscent of the progroms and international banking.
3971 2018-10-29 16:03:58 Yeah! There’s one that’s like get an oil change, multipoint inspection and tire rotation for $80. I have synthetic oil too so that’s what I usually go with
3972 2018-10-29 16:03:56 @realDonaldTrump  Behind your sir...100%
from and oil driller in Texas
3973 2018-10-29 16:03:52 im also not independently wealthy, or the heir to an oil empire
3974 2018-10-29 16:03:48 Multi trillion dollar business...but nobody knows nothin. Coordinates are always wrong. Driving round in circles in the middle of hills have eyes country. And all anyone ever says is “welcome to the oil field”
3975 2018-10-29 16:03:47 Remember, under Mr.Trudeau’s “plan” each province will be given back their carbon tax revenue. Now each province will have to come up with a replacement for coal? Won’t happen, eastern Canada still runs on Saudi oil, so I can’t see unification on coal replacement.Chasing our tail
3976 2018-10-29 16:03:44 good for you Darren. Back EV's too. They are hugely tangible and far faster to implement than political solutions bogged down by Oil and Gas lobbies that corrupt both sides of the aisle
3977 2018-10-29 16:03:42 Mungkin lip oil yg ku jastip tidak ada barangnya adalah pertanda bahwa aku tidak boleh boros.................dan aku bisa punya alasan utk beli lip tint yg ku incar hehehehe.
3978 2018-10-29 16:03:22 Just like the conservatives were focused and ripped off the province.  It is easy to talk when the oil prices were high.  Stop your lying.
3979 2018-10-29 16:03:19 Just cocunut oil..
3980 2018-10-29 16:03:17 #TOM TomCoEnergy 

lots of Excitement now about this, been under the radar for a good while. £7mil Mcap with a low risk play, Oil is a given at 126mil barrels, cost to extract is where we are at, testing has started, good results will see this £50mil Macp with $80 oil.
3981 2018-10-29 16:03:13 You are completely correct, but don’t expect an oil industry pundit to agree to that.

3985 2018-10-29 16:02:49 Could it be that wheat, corn, corn oil, seed oils,  vegetable oils in nearly all processed foods are creating hignher amounts of inflammation in their bodies. Thus the body is over taxed? Thinking out loud 
3986 2018-10-29 16:02:47 Don’t forget oil and gas worker/grandmother that spoke about her job!

3989 2018-10-29 16:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
3990 2018-10-29 16:02:07 Ah. In an IT sense, process can be very non linear indeed. ATC isn't linear either as it's so multi dimensional physically. Totally get where you're coming from on oil/gas, the parallels are something like photosynthesis, say. Or Bessemer!

Says oil industry representative.
3993 2018-10-29 16:01:42 "There is no question that the Oil Company Defendants took Lady Freyberg’s gas and have therefore committed the tort of conversion."

Order to go as: Defendant to give Lady Freyberg her gas back.
3994 2018-10-29 16:01:40 Stupid. They were doing much better. Haslam’s need to sell and stick to the oil business.
3995 2018-10-29 16:01:35 Did the same yesterday. Slept til 11, didn't get my oil changed or haircut. It happens. Be kind to yourself.

3998 2018-10-29 16:01:32 Unrestrained Capitalism is bad. I imagine unrestrained Socialism would be bad too. So what causes unrestraint? People cannot hold more than one ideology in their heads at once. But two legs are unstable. The third leg is Realism, where democracy chooses to disband an oil company.

4025 2018-10-29 15:58:51 On another note if the world doesn't overcome it's oil addiction then it's pretty much the end of us all

So either, we persevere and oil power becomes meaningless in the future
Or people keep making regressive shariaesque laws and everything ends

4029 2018-10-29 15:58:38 I don’t have one. My 2 work colleagues think I’m  but I don’t like mayo, and all the others seem to be oil based or very sugary. I also don’t like the soggy nature once it’s waited until 12:00. Just salt and pepper for me.

4039 2018-10-29 15:57:13 Or when electric cars become more prevalent and importance of oil comes down. West will dump the oil countries in no time. Thats why those oil countries are desparately trying to diversify.
4040 2018-10-29 15:57:12 No, my tweets were full of facts. I done with you and Edward. I have a very low tolerance for snake oil salesmen and that is what you are. You think you can piss on me and tell me that its rain? Heck no. So as the British say: Kindly piss off!
4041 2018-10-29 15:57:01 Nothin will change until people know that refugees are caused by oppressive governments and climate change, which are caused by our forced dependence on Saudi oil. A sustainable economy based on #solar and #hemp grown by local #farmers is the solution.
4042 2018-10-29 15:56:51 For long I subscribed to the belief that 9/11 is itself an internal conspiracy to gain military access to regimes considered inimical to KSA+oil+defence axis. Thanks for this thread. One may know 50 years hence when info related to 9/11 declassified.

 But I do think that's not going to last

4069 2018-10-29 15:54:15 That you shouldn't fully spend all of your oil revenues, you should diversify your economy too. Also that you really need to watch out for backstabbing from the capitalist class engineering food scarcity.

4095 2018-10-29 15:51:29 Mr President @realDonaldTrump and son @DonaldJTrumpJr  Please speak to Washington State Voters. Even on the ballot they are trying to say that the bad air we had all summer was from the steel mine and oil rigs (instead of the fires in Washington+Canada) saying close them down.

4105 2018-10-29 15:50:18 So what does fossils aren't fossils mean?I'm assuming you're talking about crude oil,natural gas & coal
4106 2018-10-29 15:50:08 i think process means essentially linear where something goes from A to B. so Aircraft Control is arguably process but aeroplane not so much. It's very much an oil/ gas chemical engineering term (as you hinted at). All the HAZOP basically. HAZOP doesn't really work for planes.

4113 2018-10-29 15:49:08 It’s absolutely feasible. I am just guessing, and I have absolutely no evidence, but I wonder if these cart corporations work with oil corporations to stifle energy efficiency regulations. Corporations are horrid entities so much of the time.
4114 2018-10-29 15:49:06 I’ve got so much done this morning minus getting my oil changed that I keep putting off
4115 2018-10-29 15:48:57 I found a good ass place to start getting my oil changes.
4116 2018-10-29 15:48:57 Tak, mineral oil should be ok cuma ada certain orang je yg tak sesuai :)
4117 2018-10-29 15:48:46 So should I send you oils so you can at least give my edges a hot oil treatment with the free heat you’re getting in hell? What’s the address ma’am?
4118 2018-10-29 15:48:09 Today is Monday, Day 7 of the #Breezango Case File: #PreparatoryFashion. Our active Officer has been burning the midnight oil all week long, preparing to take down some hardened fashion criminals. Get those cells ready, Detectives. We might just see some action tonight.

4121 2018-10-29 15:47:54 Diffuse some peppermint oil near where you’re hearing the mice. That’ll be a good preventative measure (they hate peppermint).
4122 2018-10-29 15:47:45 use baby oil or get some bond remover and massage your hair and it will come out.
4123 2018-10-29 15:47:42 “pizza is fattening”

yeah pizza in other countries is fattening because you put so much shit (and oil) on top but authentic italian pizza isn’t
4124 2018-10-29 15:47:32 I have always been an EV/boed guy, but NAV is a useful periodic datapoint that like other metrics should be considered. Regardless, the oil business is tough.
4125 2018-10-29 15:47:29 This recipe I’m following basically told me to heat the oil until it was smoking. So just what I do on most days then? 
4126 2018-10-29 15:47:29 I am absolutely smitten with plum oil right now! It smells of marzipan and dried cherries and has the most divine skin feel

4128 2018-10-29 15:47:14 Nigeria does not have an independent regulator in the oil and gas industry. Decision-making now is focused on the short term political cycle. An independent regulator would help us take a long term view. #PIGB #fixouroil

4130 2018-10-29 15:46:41 New high for $PBR though, Bolsonoro will single-handedly shield all Brazil stocks from any lower oil prices
4131 2018-10-29 15:46:38 I know little apart from a conversation with a friend with 30 yrs experience in oil business. Minor seismic activity happens frequently during the drilling operation. But that area is also known for natural seismic activity.

Is that lube or cooking oil?
#GigabaChallenge
4146 2018-10-29 15:44:23 LOL. You haven't seen the way I cook. Open a cardboard box then put it in the microwave. Although I can change oil in a tractor. Did not learn the skills of cooking from my mom although I learned a lot of things outside from my father.

4149 2018-10-29 15:44:08 Wall Street has no problem accepting USDs or buying and selling Saudi oil or the oil produced by Saudi allies.

Nor are the against buying and selling gasoline, plastics, fiberglass or the thousands of other products made by oil.
4150 2018-10-29 15:44:04 Well, when people have researched certain "journalists" doing articles on EVs, very often links to oil companies/Koch brothers come up. Just look at the Tesla stories from a certain WSJ motoring journalist....

4164 2018-10-29 15:42:45 Canada is a leader already and our oil industry generates oil cleaner with less pollution than any other country, We import oil from Saudi Arabia & Venezuela, just think about that for a moment. They pollute the planet, torture & kill off humanity.
4165 2018-10-29 15:42:16 Some dry mud came off my boots onto the carpet and I'm getting scowls from the absolute joker who in youth once spilt a gallon of cooking oil onto the kitchen floor and skated around on it all night.

4191 2018-10-29 15:39:19 Post WWII hegemonic policies have been to squash socialism in place of anything, really. All because social democracy is antithetical to oligarchy/duopoly, theft of oil, diamonds, gas, poppy fields... wars, institutionalised elitism, occupation....

4213 2018-10-29 15:36:43 Problem with my latest failure was a sealed bearing gave out.  Greasing it does no good for the bearings.  One is an open face that gets oil in timing cover and the other is sealed.   And when it goes it sends debris into timing cover.

4237 2018-10-29 15:34:54 Oil and Gas company #Total received permission from the Prefecture of #Cayenne last week to begin oil exploration off the coast of #FrenchGuiana . The drilling could begin by the end of the year in the center of the area attributed. @IntellFusion #LatinAmerica, #Guyane
4238 2018-10-29 15:34:53 It has been genuinely confusing me how an administration could be (& they are), hard line WASP - pro-Israel - anti muslim (except the ones with oil and weapons orders) & anti semitic. As extreme as that theory is, it is the only way it reconciles...

4242 2018-10-29 15:34:35 Glad it helps your neck pain.  It's not easy living in constant pain.  Hubby has tried cbd oil in the lowest strength, maybe needs to go to the stronger one.
4243 2018-10-29 15:34:34 "Ron, UPS is dropping off the oil change for my car and my eyeliner today"

From the same place?

"No. I'm telling you because I don't want the eyeliner sitting outside and so you know you need to change my oil"
4244 2018-10-29 15:34:28 Interesting analogy by Henry, but Oil is really the driver of the drivers of the economy...our political ruling class. They need the oil revenue to survive. The PIGB is designed to bring some equity, efficiency and transparency into this vital sector of our economy
4245 2018-10-29 15:34:21 So many parades the duck boats need an oil change
4246 2018-10-29 15:34:18 UK electricity is 10% coal and less than 1% oil. Most of the remaining coal plants will be closed in less than 3 years.
4247 2018-10-29 15:34:16 And the Conservatives were so much better???? They had YEARS of money pouring in from royalties and blew every cent of it so that the second the price of oil tanked, the province was broke!!!! Blaming Notley for BC’s obstructionism is a cop out!

4250 2018-10-29 15:34:05 Uncle said US stopped pumping oil so that public would use foreign oil & US would save their's.  That way one day the US would again be largest exporter of oil in world.  HE was so right.

4253 2018-10-29 15:33:38 Semantics, I suppose. Putting snowtires on your car (the E-program) for the season isn't maintenance, it's an adjustment to new environment reality.
Changing your oil IS maintenance, but has no software equivalent.
The car always had wheels though.
4254 2018-10-29 15:33:34 No, I stated that GERS allocates 100% oil tax revenue to Scotland. GERS is just an accounting tool to apportion revenue and costs - has only been in use for around the last 20 years. UK only taxes oil profits and has been a low tax economy - unlike Norway.
4255 2018-10-29 15:33:28 Ugh. Can't use lactic acid - makes my (beige and pink) skin worse.  Winter skin is the worst. Glad you found an answer! And yes, I use lotion.  And natural topical anti-inflammatories, like arnica cream. And CBD in hemp seed oil.  Good for pain, too.
4256 2018-10-29 15:33:19 Why you should vote @MikeLevinCA @ACampaNajjar , and D for any House/Senate races:

1) ACA, save protections for pre-existing conditions
2) Stop tax breaks to wealthiest 
3) Improve government not break it
4) Stop DJTs #CultureOfCorruption
5) No offshore oil rigs
6) No baby jails

4261 2018-10-29 15:32:55 I don’t know who needs to hear this, get an oil change
4262 2018-10-29 15:32:49 Today just might be the day I stop being lazy bcuz I highkey could’ve changed my own oil...
4263 2018-10-29 15:32:46 there was no oil embargo in 73.  They claimed shortage of oil.  My uncle worked for STANDARD OIL OF CA.  He said was no reason for high prices.  ALL storage places for oil & gas were full.  They were not pumping because no place to store it.
4264 2018-10-29 15:32:38 President George Washington did not have a high school education. unlike most of his contemporaries e.g Thomas Jefferson! Obasanjo has failed to answer Professor Woke Soyinka's challenges that he gave oil license for love, to his girlfriend!!  Read the attached book.
4265 2018-10-29 15:32:35 The point of all this is that the same reason why you can't use gold anymore is the same one why you can't buy oil in a different currency that USD

FED privatizes the money 100 years ago. That's why I'm in crypto

4280 2018-10-29 15:30:27 I use a combination of herbs and hemp oil. My legs are so dry, even my Dr. Tells me to lotion them up. My face, ugh, at 5o, I still get acne, the skin around my nostrils peel, it's lovely. If I could justify the cost of going for facials, I would, but I can't.
4281 2018-10-29 15:30:23 He doesn’t go for beer, only snails do. Try an organic insecticide or make one, lots of garlic in water with a little oil. Basically, create an environment with texture and smell they won’t like.

4284 2018-10-29 15:30:08 Каламбур же в подписи в скобках, как под картинами. Oil on canvas, масляная краска на холсте, а не butter. Но без пояснения для English speakers, что "oil" and "butter" are homonyms (масло) in Russian, шутка не работает все равно.
4285 2018-10-29 15:30:07 なんの準備もせず、店に足を運ぶことなく、目の前にどんとイクラ丼を置かれたらさすがに「めんどくせぇ」とはならないだろうが、「うへぇ、見ただけでお腹一杯です」とはなりそう。おかしい。
4286 2018-10-29 15:30:05 I think a good indicator that my life is a mess is when I get an oil change and tell my 16 year old friend and she says “about damn time” #ICantAdult
4287 2018-10-29 15:29:51 @mwearnyc oil slick
4288 2018-10-29 15:29:48 WSJ Ed. Board will never advocate price controls for anything. All free market advocates (me included) would cancel WSJ if they did!  Problem is that Rx is a weird market compared to oil, retail, tech etc. in part due to  gov't/private payer hybrid. Solutions are so difficult.
4289 2018-10-29 15:29:35 Change oil na si bebe ko

4292 2018-10-29 15:29:21 Earlier this year, "peer-reviewed" research suggested that fish-oil doesn't work. Now, they are creating a medical fish oil that they can reap profits from, which magically does work. This is capitalism. But that means, that if the system is changed, we can turn the tide.
4293 2018-10-29 15:29:20 Yes CBD oil, definitely worth a try. And I hope it works for you as well.
4294 2018-10-29 15:29:16 Mmmm Carrabba's,  with that oil.....man I miss bread
4295 2018-10-29 15:29:15 Is that brown bread dipped in oil??
4296 2018-10-29 15:29:10 Instead of Destroying can’t we be exporting to countries where its has been legalized?  We can’t depend on Oil and Gas only.

4311 2018-10-29 15:27:31 This is the speech you've always used. Trump and the CLA should know more about Brazil than the Brazilians themselves. The Amazon then... Brazil is the gold mine of the United States. World's largest water reserve and one of the largest oil reserves. Besides other riches.
4312 2018-10-29 15:27:28 Oil is the driver of the economy. PIGB allows that driver a better grip on the vehicle

4332 2018-10-29 15:25:30 ummmm........... vaccines, hello?? They put peanut oil in some vaccines.

They take orders from the CDC who is corrupted by profits from vaccines

4346 2018-10-29 15:24:25 lol you do know that’s the reason Great Britain declared war on Germany right? Your example makes no sense.

Likewise the true strength of the USD is that it’s defacto back by oil, as it’s the main and often only currency accepted by the majority of the major oil producers in ME.

4354 2018-10-29 15:24:01 How is growing the economy of Texas not in the best interest of Texas? Last I heard, oil jobs pay a little bit better than Whataburger. It's called get people off govt dependence. That's what Texas is all about. Except El Paso, which is governed like corrupt Mexico.

4369 2018-10-29 15:22:06 The Saudis are bad players when it comes to human rights and such-we’ve been tolerant of that because of overriding national oil and security concerns.  Whataboutism hugely comes into play.  It’s not a Trump only issue.  All have to come together and take a collective hit.

4377 2018-10-29 15:21:05 Do you think it's easy. The people who stole have money and can bribe their way. Are you aware PMB said by 2019 he won't renew oil licences to individuals? Instead the oil blocks will go to states in order to increase their revenue. Now tell me why the victims won't fight back.

4442 2018-10-29 15:13:54 1. The liquid fraction of palm oil is known as palm olein, while the solid fraction as palm stearin. Palm oil has a balanced fatty acid composition in which the level of saturated fatty acids (Palmitic Acid C16:0 = 44%) is almost equal to that of the unsaturated fatty acids.

4454 2018-10-29 15:12:54 But thats's the same as for oil extraction; high pressure water (mixes). That's why I don't understand what's different between gas and oil; both involve water being forced at high pressure through rock.

4507 2018-10-29 15:07:24 Also you should know that Venezuela has the worlds largest amount of oil. not the ME. Saudi is 2nd but then comes Canada. Oil is not the goal here. It part of it as it has to do with controlling and stealing resources but the wars aren't waged on oil alone

4512 2018-10-29 15:06:35 On conference call with API (largest U.S. oil group) where they outlining a poll of consumer sentiment of E15...spoiler alert: they don't like it
4513 2018-10-29 15:06:23 Black Seed Oil is a bitter but excellent boast to your immune system, it works from the inside and is known and proven to get you feeling your best! 

Get yours today only R150
4514 2018-10-29 15:06:23 I wonder y it took lot of time in identification of this oil as of bunker 
And who is responsible for this. Silence on this is strange

4517 2018-10-29 15:06:10 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
4518 2018-10-29 15:06:08 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
4519 2018-10-29 15:06:01 Down until the 5th... still convinced that EU countries and BRICS will begin trading oil and commodities outside of the USD beginning with Iranian sanctions. This is just speculation based on statements by the respective country leaders, specifically putin, who is most outspoken
4520 2018-10-29 15:06:00 In Texas they squelched the Oil industry for like 25 years. Why was that good? Because Texas then did not have to get involved in the business of other states. With less at stake there, we might just as well dismantle some bases. Like they are so useful since 1952.
4521 2018-10-29 15:05:59 Don't get comfy...the economy is about to take a hit. Haven't you noticed the skyrocketing cost of groceries, gas, heating oil, etc.? Not to mention the farmers have become socialists and are being paid by the government so they won't revolt due to how much they are losing. #MAGA

4528 2018-10-29 15:05:20 My redneck friends don't realize how urgent the need for change is. My hippie friends don't know how complicated it will be. Since WWII, the whole world has organized around  and fought about producing or securing oil. Change will make geopolitics very volatile.
4529 2018-10-29 15:05:17 Especially ‘10 and ‘12. Starting rotation was beginning to leak oil pretty badly in ‘14, and we all know who came to the rescue then.

4532 2018-10-29 15:05:10 Vahrenholt is a politician and chemist who worked for oil companies, not a scientist who researches climate change.

Lüning is a geologist who works for an oil company, not a scientist who researches climate change.

They aren't solar *or* climate experts!

4536 2018-10-29 15:04:35 What’s my secret to flawless skin? Water, coconut oil and lying to men while taking their money.
4537 2018-10-29 15:04:25 Ans: India, unless the USA buries Indian economy under high oil prices (& uncertain deliveries) resulting from Iran sanctions, aribitrary tariffs on steel, aluminum etc and busts India”s defence budget through Russia sanctions! 
4538 2018-10-29 15:04:14 I remember when all this went down. It also coincided about the same time as the event horizon accident. So it actually helped give Petrobras a bigger interest in the global oil market.

4545 2018-10-29 15:03:20 Boom or bust?! ....... how about helping us getting oroduct to market or maybe NOT buying oil from the Middle East. So yes you can help us with the bust or boom.

4548 2018-10-29 15:02:49 Somalia has nothing to do with anything. The president of Somalia cant go to the toilet without African Union soldiers. Somaliland is sovereign from Somalia 100%.
That is why the DPworld contract is signed with Somaliland, same with oil exploration!

4555 2018-10-29 15:02:34 It's time for everyone to acknowledge that shale plays are an important & permanent part of the supply landscape. It has & will continue to mean higher oil prices b/c the technology to produce it isn't cheap. Main point of Peak Oil = end of CHEAP oil!

4559 2018-10-29 15:02:02 Surely Tagwire's refusal to open up the oil pipeline on Saturday as he was in church destabilizes the economy. State prosecutors can hv a field day just on that. Hopefully whoever is alleging that this in fact happened must have the V11s.
4560 2018-10-29 15:01:50 Hey Adam, thanks for the question! The legalized cannabis oil on the market is for oil consumption either with a dropper or in capsule form. The vaping and vape juice you are referring to are for an illegal product. Sorry about the confusion!
4561 2018-10-29 15:01:44 Where'd you find it? Because right now I use pure body oil. Lotion, all of it, laughs at me .

Chinese food
Italian food
Dairy
Eggs
Fat
Oil
Red meat

Destroying entire industries in the process.    I remember trying out all these "fat free" or "low fat" foods.  Jesus.

4583 2018-10-29 14:59:37 Sounds like you're doing everything right to me, just probably the primer is messing you up. When I prep my face for fenty I use a moisturizer and then an oil . My skin is oily. 

I have never gotten into primers too much

4586 2018-10-29 14:59:19 Saudi Arabia, a country named after a family, without a constitution, without history. The ruling family a bunch of marauders were looting travellers before they had found oil. You are the root of wahabi/takfiri terrorists like Al-qaida and isis. Your end is near, inshallah.
4587 2018-10-29 14:59:19 The #GOP knows how bad it would be for them to receive a resounding thumping on Nov 6th thus ending what would be a "last hurrah" for the white oil soaked patriarchy, but make no mistake, they will pull out every stop legal or no. #VoteBlue &put them back on history's trash heap.
4588 2018-10-29 14:59:06 I'm white and I have terrible ashy skin. I slather on oil in the shower and after I have dried off I put on lotion. LOL. Ashy, dry skin and eczema suck!!!!!

4590 2018-10-29 14:58:50 Disagree, Kopech once he gets healthy, will come back better than before. Moncada will have a huge 2019! I told you a yr ago, your putting too much oil on ur Pappy subs & it’s going to ur head!
4591 2018-10-29 14:58:35 Got my oil changed and my tires rotated and I picked up my car and the dude asked me why I decided to buy a 5 speed and it told them they are fun and he started listing off all the benefits of a 5 speed. Type of energy I needed
4592 2018-10-29 14:58:27 Ask your doctor? Ask for a change of site. Could be to be nearer where they are needed. Cannabis oil is recommended to be taken as near to the site of the problem as possible which is why there are suppositories.

4602 2018-10-29 14:57:44 "FREE"   advice for your health ! Take Flax seed oil everyday because it  has more omega 3's than omega 6's.  Omega 3's  inhibit inflammation,  whereas omega 6's increase inflammation.  Fish and fish oils contain   more omega 3's but they may also contain mercury or radiation.

4607 2018-10-29 14:57:25 I am white; my skin gets dry and scaly and cracks in the cold months if I don’t use something to moisturize. So I don’t think the problem is unique to one race or ethnicity. I use lots and lots of coconut oil.
4608 2018-10-29 14:57:07 @Morning_Joe REPUBLICANS/TRUMP continue to remind "we the people" that they control the entire gov. including the SEC that looks the other way as WALL ST.

4612 2018-10-29 14:56:47 Yep, Blair was also involved in the schemes with Sarkozy & Clinton to steel Libya's oil. Sarkozy has been charged for some of it, but it was direct bribes from Khadaffi to protect him. Which he reneged on when picking his replacements looked more profitable.

We love that your products are safe for animals and get used when there's an oil spill. We don't like that you advertise on Fox News and would ask that you reconsider your ad budget.

4643 2018-10-29 14:53:19 It’s a striking point. In some respects, This is about platforms and the type of platform but it also has to be about a large % of people’s willingness to buy snake oil when someone’s selling.
4644 2018-10-29 14:53:17 We know the U.S. are involve in this. Now you can get our rainforest, oil, and whatever you want, right?

Who cares people are gonna die? Not you.

Your kind of people are the worst.

4654 2018-10-29 14:52:04 So it's all about $$$ in your pocket. Carbon tax is directly user based. Your solution is to say forget about what changes we can make and let's get rich off of oil. Got it. Again...the money goes back to the taxpayers. $$$'s win?

4658 2018-10-29 14:51:52 Hydrocarbons are volatile materials - which is why they are valuable industrial materials - and why it is so stupid to burn them.  

2/3 of fossil fuels are burned.  Stop doing that and the price of oil will plummet.  And the tar sands will be priced out of business.

Simple.

4661 2018-10-29 14:51:32 Itt!!! Oil!!!!
4662 2018-10-29 14:51:22 I understand that GERS is a political tool to ensure westminster can keep 92% of scots oil and gas revenues.
Scotland is a very rich country,which is why your country wont let go!
4663 2018-10-29 14:51:14 Watching ESPN while I get my oil changed. People are arguing!! Yelling!!! Heated! Screaming at each other in a circle about sports!! I don’t know what’s going on but this is great dialogue!

4668 2018-10-29 14:50:52 Dignity and oil are both swiftly dwindling resources that originated in long dead things that have yielded as much harm as benefit.
4669 2018-10-29 14:50:47 If he is a good man the media will label him an authoritarian or a dictator!!! CIA will swing in and undermine him. Or just an assassination and coverup. It is how the rich roll when oil is involved.

4672 2018-10-29 14:50:20 still a touch green. But can’t wait until it’s all in the right window. Compromise some oil in the first few.
4673 2018-10-29 14:50:17 OK if GERS states that scots get 100% of the oil revenues,then how do you explain westminster figures showing that westminster has taken 92% of oil revenues for 50 years?
GERS is shite and well you know it,,,it is your straw to clutch,and your only straw

It's not rocket science, but the diet pill, gadget and workout industry won't allow the information out. I lost about 30 lbs in 1 year, no lie.

4693 2018-10-29 14:48:14 The embassy is twofold. It appeals to Evangelicals who see it as part of the End of Days prophesy, gaining their vote. It also appeals financially to those in power because they are now getting oil contracts. It has nothing to do with supporting the Jewish faith or people.

4720 2018-10-29 14:45:40 I think what usually happens is when the Pres visit Saudi Arabia they say, yeah we'll buy your oil sell you weapons ignore human rights records support your regime,  but DON'T push it. But then Trump was elected, and he didn't know or bother to learn any of this....

4754 2018-10-29 14:42:03 Well the way I look at it it’s steaming ahead to become a major issue with environmentalists.  More oil this year and draining of well energy means less the next year also.  Shale growth in 19 will be very challenged.

4756 2018-10-29 14:41:35 Bonding glue is easily dissolved with oil. Buy an oil sheen spray and go to town directly on the glue, through the wig cap all the way to your scalp, it’ll loosen and start to slide off.
4757 2018-10-29 14:41:29 not to be weak but my head really hurts and I have to go get my oil changed can someone pray for me thanks love y’all 
4758 2018-10-29 14:41:27 And yes, any increase is government interference like this is to be resisted. We arent a resource poor landlocked european country. Stop imitating them- they would (have) killed for oil reserves like the one we sit on.

4770 2018-10-29 14:40:47 I'm serious. The Arabs and Russians have no more produced their oil than Brazil its rainforest, yet the world buys it from them. Either that, or declare planetary emergency, conquer what you need and use it or conserve it as you please. Consistency.

4785 2018-10-29 14:38:55 I’m sitting here writing down my Thanksgiving menu and making this cellulite oil, and it hit me. This time next year the teen will be living in a dorm. The teen won’t be home to remind me that she needs Spanish food with her turkey!

When I saw Rick Simpson’s “Run from the cure” I made some RSO and tested it.
I think a balm of cannabis in a base of coconut oil, butter, lard, etc would be the perfect treatment for burns.
4792 2018-10-29 14:38:19 When I was young, if I went to the store for corned beef, I got “cornbeef.” Today, they ask if I want it in oil, water, or canola oil, halal or kosher, free range, credit or debit? Forget cash. I miss the clarity of choices of my childhood. This diarrhea of choices is poverty...

4801 2018-10-29 14:36:54 Every now and then, "a natural hack" hits the market and smart companies capitalize on it and cash out big time.
Two years ago, it was coconut oil, black soap and Shea butter now it's alkaline water.

4803 2018-10-29 14:36:51 Flaring allows tax revenue on oil to flow to TX treasury. That's the main function of the TX RRC. The TCEQ (commission on environmental quality) is not in the driver's seat on this.

4805 2018-10-29 14:36:47 Fuckin retweet.

4806 2018-10-29 14:36:36 Recession was simply the crash of crude oil price internationally. Virtually all oil producing countries experienced recession, but were able to cushion its resultant effects through their savings during oil boom period. Stop faulting Buhari for recession!

4818 2018-10-29 14:35:04 Well, I am a climate hawk. Gas helps when it directly replaces coal. It hurts when it replaces nuclear. Oil and gas industry unfortunately supports a race to the bottom, slashing rules on methane leaks and offshore drilling. It has failed to make CCS its top or top 10 priority.

Oil regulator PNGRB given permission 4 it.
This pipeline has capacity of 8-Cr घन मीटर Natural Gas ट्रांसपोर्ट daily but performing below 5%of capacity.
Brookfield debut
4841 2018-10-29 14:32:43 That's a terrible way to look at it. Might as well say the oil has been drilled, the coal has been dug up. Sustainability and clean living is about making those sacrifices despite them not being necessary.

4844 2018-10-29 14:31:57 Always forget that scar tissue will pop when rubbed. I’ve been putting coconut oil on all of them and I decided to do the recent scars. It popped and scared the crap outta me. It’s fine tho. I’m fine.
4845 2018-10-29 14:31:55 Poor little snake oil salesman. Can’t keep his grip on people anymore. Made his millions being a racist and spewing hate and division. Would be great if he stops cheating the American people and paid his taxes.

4878 2018-10-29 14:28:50 Agree with you that Volcker conquering inflation is a big myth. From my framework, leading inflation dynamics peaked several years before. I also think that were it not for the oil shock of 1973, inflation would have peaked even earlier. However, ....

4895 2018-10-29 14:26:54 "at current battery prices, for an electric vehicle to be cheaper to run than a gas-power car, oil would have to cost $350 a barrel. Last year, it averaged $50. To make up the difference would require a carbon tax of $700 a ton of carbon dioxide."

4897 2018-10-29 14:26:12 The US has an opportunity herein to improve the situation in Venezuela and increase leverage with Saudi Arabia by floating oil purchases from Venz if they demonstrate vast improvements in govt & human rights.

4907 2018-10-29 14:25:13 I would imagine the main reason is that Venezuela stopped using the petrodollar and has issued their own oil backed currency. A few other notable countries that stopped using the petrodollar; Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Iran
4908 2018-10-29 14:25:05 According to Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, no one has any idea how much oil Iran will be able to export after new U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic kick in on Nov. 4.

4928 2018-10-29 14:23:05 It already has, the labour front bench can't add up let alone run a multi national, most of the train delays are down to rail track and the government runs that, most of the oil price is tax, start on private business, and watch the place empty,
4929 2018-10-29 14:22:57 Oil change, Fill-in, ABC store
4930 2018-10-29 14:22:56 If forced to eat in restaurants, we can still take small measures like ordering chapathi instead of naan or going to subway instead of mcdonalds or ordering grill item cooked with bare minimum oil instead of oily gravy. 
Several restaurants have salads too.
4931 2018-10-29 14:22:54 Do NOT use tea tree oil if you have pets it will KILL THEM. Tea tree oil is very harmful to animals.
4932 2018-10-29 14:22:50 me: drinks theraflu as much as i am allowed and tea all day day long with acv and honey or honey and lemon, makes peppermint oil shower melts, mixes coconut oil and peppermint oil to use like vaporub, sleeps all day

4935 2018-10-29 14:22:43 Also, most of these 27 microseismic fracture events have a magnitude of less than 0, which means they fall with the "Green" level of the Oil and Gas authority's traffic light system.
4936 2018-10-29 14:22:39 Oh, a dude from a country full of men that are afraid of women and girls. So weak. I look forward to the day your oil runs out and you go back to your caves.
4937 2018-10-29 14:22:28 Like fixing an oil leak and then not putting the O-rings back in the engine?
4938 2018-10-29 14:22:16 What will happen to this country when there is no oil?  #NigeriaBeyondToday
4939 2018-10-29 14:22:07 $50 sayes the dye in the ink that makes that lovely green is petroleum based. Everywhere you go, everything you eat requires oil.... #oott
4940 2018-10-29 14:22:07 @AmericaNewsroom I don't know why the Democrats feel that free healthcare make America better it has to be paid for somehow so taxes would go up they would shut the coalfields down oil fields down and we go into another depression plain and simple
4941 2018-10-29 14:21:59 WTI oil $67.48/barrel, near unchanged.
4942 2018-10-29 14:21:54 So you've got no comeback to Palmyra & Aleppo?
That's cause you're clearly biased. 
Every area SAA have retaken, has first had lethal & destructive air-strikes that have destroyed defenses.
You want oil & gas in E Syria, autonomy for N Syria & return of Afrin & Hatay for #SDF

4949 2018-10-29 14:20:54 I can vouch for it for joint pain. It's the only thing that helps with my neck.
For parkinsons and seizures, cancer treatment, lupus etc, you need the stronger cannabis oil with some THC. Still illegal in this country, unfortunately.
I recommend Simply cbd, 10% strength (black)
4950 2018-10-29 14:20:53 Blame 9/11 on the Saudis. The Trump/ Saudi oil for weapons alliance is concerned with nothing but greed!This greed is the cause of 1 MILLION Yemenis people on the brink of starvation!Trump is not only destroying the U.S. His destruction is global. 
PLEASE IMPEACH YOUR PRESIDENT!

4955 2018-10-29 14:20:14 And that assumes that you could even transition into democracy without violence. Look at examples in the region. Iraq even with an American occupation and hundreds of thousands of casualties still struggles without law and order and basic services despite its massive oil wealth
4956 2018-10-29 14:20:11 if corn oil is made from corn, and vegetable oil is made from vegetables, then what is baby oil made from? ooof

4965 2018-10-29 14:18:53 Think about how many cars roll off the lot with bad alignment, oil leaks, etc. Then imagine that instead of breaking down on the interstate, you fell out of the sky.
4966 2018-10-29 14:18:40 More Canadians need to understand the Kock Brothers donate 1 million to Alberta Prosperity Fund. Not only do the Kock Bros have vast oil sand interest, they are the ones pushing for deregulation on food (dairy) and medical (pharmaceuticals) here in Canada as well as UK.

4968 2018-10-29 14:18:03 I was just at a quick oil change place and the man sitting in the waiting room with me advised me to say that line too  I guess maybe that place had a reputation for that

4971 2018-10-29 14:17:52 Hey U.S. please subsidize our military against Russia while we prop up Russian economy with oil pipeline.  Great ally.
4972 2018-10-29 14:17:49 I just saw an ad for a motor oil for my car.  It said I should buy it because "it works as hard as I do."    That's sort of implies that I actually should NOT be using that oil for my car....
4973 2018-10-29 14:17:43 Crude oil reference
4974 2018-10-29 14:17:35 Try 2 tablespoons of Oil and Vineger and see what comes out the next day and know this...even if you bring in the actual Parasite to be tested it'll keep coming back negative.

4981 2018-10-29 14:17:18 Food and Eye Health• Fish oil and flaxseed oil are super supplements that contain Omega 3 fatty acids and have many eye health benefits such as; preventing dry eye and reducing the risk of Cataracts.
4982 2018-10-29 14:17:16 The fourth yes. The others no. That's called a oil slick color pattern on the others. Seeing as how those are the only colors showing in oil and water when light reflects. Use your brain and technology instead of just what you see on the surface
4983 2018-10-29 14:17:10 US oil giant ConocoPhillips released more details of its $2 billion settlement with Venezuela's state-run oil company, saying it already secured $345 million in cash & commodities as part of a deal ending a dispute over the country's nationalization of its petroleum industry

4988 2018-10-29 14:16:40 Steve's an investment, not an oil guy. His work always takes a grim view of shale plays (laconic coming from me!). For the many negatives about the plays, I don't see an impending catastrophic failure b/c of debt & decline rates. A global economic meltdown is more likely.

4992 2018-10-29 14:16:17 You can make pancakes by mixing vanilla protein powder and egg whites and cooking them in a pan with coconut oil or butter.

They don't taste like fluffy buttermilk pancakes, but they're not bad.

4995 2018-10-29 14:15:49 We have a $21 trillion debt with a skyrocketing defecit. He must want a good deal on oil.  Watch your country suffer with these two aligned.
4996 2018-10-29 14:15:42 Yeah, I used to do tuna+mayo, (usually +Tabasco/Crystal, sriracha, or vinegared gochujang) but switched to eating the oil-packed stuff raw.  I figured whatever other calories I gained from the oil is offset by not eating it with mayo, etc, anymore.
4997 2018-10-29 14:15:40 アルコールの味感じますよー。日本酒は御神酒を一口なら生きてます。
4998 2018-10-29 14:15:39 I’m not asking to outlaw oil tomorrow, I’m asking to make a transition but Republicans are resistant for no good reason. Once again it’s all black or white with Republicans.
4999 2018-10-29 14:15:29 Flint, Michigan, still doesn't have clean water, much of Puerto Rico is still without power, crude oil keeps pouring into our water supplies in the Midwest, the police are still killing with near impunity, and fascists feel comfortable to be openly racist
5000 2018-10-29 14:15:16 #TOM it is not a drill because we know the oil is there.  More a proof of concept of tech that’s been known to work previously.  Only upgraded and improved for 2018.   30p target on success.

5002 2018-10-29 14:15:10 You are the Bully Pulpit stop your constant barrage on the Media - Perhaps stay in the White House till the election is over. You are like oil on a Fire, throwing the flame everywhere. Just Stop!!!
5003 2018-10-29 14:15:05 I read an article not long ago about deep sea oil rig welders/divers and yeah, that's a big ol' NOPE.
5004 2018-10-29 14:15:01 Someone needs to stop me from making six loaves of bread today because I am in a baking MOOD and I don’t have that much olive oil for six loaves of bread.
5005 2018-10-29 14:14:58 You think we’re going to war in Venezuela? I would think Russia, Syria and China would be at the top of the list. In that order. But Venezuela does have oil

5011 2018-10-29 14:14:40 It seems that individual countries can veto UK plans to engage with the WTO after we leave it he EU; something, it seems, the leavers never thought of. Which means we face tariffs and the cost of imports will rise accordingly. Hope no one uses orange juice, olive oil or butter!
5012 2018-10-29 14:14:35 Please inform your customers: what fats and oils do you use?  I hope butter and olive oil.

5021 2018-10-29 14:13:53 apply cold!! and then do you have h2ocean? that can help as well. and maybe some diluted tea tree oil.
5022 2018-10-29 14:13:52 When I was a kid in school in the early 70's, they told be we would be out of oil by 2020.

I guess if we run out in just a little over a year they were right.  Funny how experts seem to be wrong almost every time...
5023 2018-10-29 14:13:50 I love to use sandalwood in the palm of my hands, inhale it from my palms, an it helps me relax before bed and fall asleep. Lavender essential oil is also good for that. A blend of the two would be a nice aromatherapy.

5035 2018-10-29 14:12:42 So how are you going to pay for it? More tax cuts? If it’s protecting oil fields, shouldn’t they pay a large share? US Middle class shouldn’t be subsidizing global corporations!

5042 2018-10-29 14:12:05 Aw you massaging while you pump? Put some lotion or baby oil, and rub downwards to your nipple. It’ll help getting more milk out. If you can, try to get an electric pump it’ll help much more. If it feels like certain spots on your breast are gettin warm, massage those areas first
5043 2018-10-29 14:12:04 Is there anything more ironic than building dikes around our oil refineries to protect them from global warming?
5044 2018-10-29 14:12:01 Imagine thinking suing an oil company is anything other than performative BS.

5052 2018-10-29 14:10:46 Lol I know this chick. She's actually really good and her minimum makeup is 5k (that's same area). Sis should have cleaned the makeup with groundnut oil for faster result sef, she's wasting wipes.
5053 2018-10-29 14:10:36 And another thing I discover is that sometimes the job your applying for, for example is oil and gas and you study chemical engineering a young graduate, you don't v d experience yet and yet they are asking for 5 to 10yrs experience, in such situation, do u still need to apply
5054 2018-10-29 14:10:35 ايش معنى ذباب
5055 2018-10-29 14:10:34 Have you contacted your reps and sent feedback to NARA regarding their request to destroy records of oil- gas leases, mining, dams, wells, timber sales, marine conservation, endangered species, non-endangered species, critical habitats? Deadline today! request.schedule@nara.gov

5057 2018-10-29 14:10:17 Kevin I dont get why you think scots would struggle?
Our resources have propped up 60 MN peeps for 50 years dont you think they will go further for 5 MN peeps?
And that`s only oil and gas!

5060 2018-10-29 14:10:11 I would also add with only 4 Xrapid partners currently, the speculators are the dominant driving force right now but soon utility will eat speculators XRP up like it's nothing. Speculating on #XRP price right now is like speculating on oil before the industrial revolution began.
5061 2018-10-29 14:10:10 Started this Monday off great. Registration renewed in less than 10 mins, prayer, yoga, oil diffuser, breakfast now I’m about to take a mid morning nap. I feel great 
5062 2018-10-29 14:10:07 You need baby oil & alot of conditioner
5063 2018-10-29 14:10:04 Media needs to ignore this violent and unamerican rhetoric. I know it is hard. Focus on health care, crumbling housing market, corruption and failed tax relief scam. Beat the snake oil salesman with more facts. Stop feeding his greed for attention. @MSNBC @CNN @ShepNewsTeam

5073 2018-10-29 14:09:08 It's not an "oil lobby" issue. It's a legal issue, it's easy to prove Obama's EPA ran a shitty endangerment case @El_Spy @ClimateLawNews

5083 2018-10-29 14:07:09 I had to take my car in for an oil change once while Jay was out of town and I practiced the “I’ll have to ask my husband about that” line all day because I was afraid of being taken advantage of  I of course told him everything they said so he could check it out though

5099 2018-10-29 14:05:48 Thank you for reaching out about this! The natural flavours in our salsa contains a minute amount of both garlic & onion essence similar to our garlic infused oil and shallot infused olive oil.

It's a mesmerizing blend of Rose Water and Lavender oil. It's aroma makes it a great body mist but it's ingredients are essential ingredients for skin and hair care.

Also used cold cabbage leaves over swollen red areas. I ended up needing prescription strength hydrocortisone cream for rash. Good luck to you

5122 2018-10-29 14:03:27 Jelas salah: mengkaitkan langsung dg shale oil. Eskalasi shale oil terbatasi inherently/secara alami oleh fisis, & oleh kaidah2 mendasar industri+ekonomi.
MENA, dulu timteng, sdh diobok zionis & giant capitals (pakai tangan barat) sejak PD I/WW I. Shale oil fenomena milenia.

5132 2018-10-29 14:02:20 oil companies and other large corporations with a significant carbon footprint should definitely be the ones to pay and make it happen. if not, we need to find a better way because carbon capture is way too expensive and inefficient to address climate change anyway

5148 2018-10-29 14:01:24 Is it same as Mustard Oil?

5187 2018-10-29 13:57:52 It turns out that Byco was not at fault, investigation revealed the type of oil which had dumped near #Charna island and it was called the ‘BunkerOil’ (1 of the hazardous &  #DeadlyOils) and it has only one use that is to run the engines of bigger ships. 2/3

Lets hope it'll work on me

5197 2018-10-29 13:56:25 With the oil production and all the Politics talk about Uganda, we are likely to get more researchers coming
5198 2018-10-29 13:56:19 There’s a bag of chicken wings in the freezer and after making dinner last night, someone (it was me) left a pan of oil on the stove to cool. This can’t be a coincidence, can it?
5199 2018-10-29 13:56:19 3kg peanuts make 1 Litre oil while that 3 kg cost 3$ but 1 lit oil is sold for 1.5$..hmm when people started questing how? They come up with tactics called its 50% discount. still cannot understand their analogy on such low price...adulteration is at its best.
5200 2018-10-29 13:56:18 it was not founded in this hypothetical context though, and this also presupposes that it isn't actually a centrally operated, not actually censorship resistant network built out of ethereum snake oil, which isn't the case either

5203 2018-10-29 13:55:48 S&P 500 +1.2%, DAX +1.9%.

IBM is buying RedHat, so RedHat +47%!

Ford +5%, AT&T +3%, Apple +1%.

Vix -5% to $23.  Oil down a bit to $67/bbl.

42° here at Burger King.

I am excited for tomorrow’s new Macs, but expect that they will be lackluster, overpriced, and dongle-ridden.
5204 2018-10-29 13:55:42 Nah. We don't care about you. We're just going to loot your forests and steal your oil. Thanks, I guess.
5205 2018-10-29 13:55:22 i would advise you to get your brain checked at the nearest hospital ASAP and have your (facts/lies) checked as well.

5208 2018-10-29 13:55:13 I found a way to keep them green after cutting in half! Use avocado oil & lime (or lemon) totally coat exposed insides in avocado oil & lime then lay flat cut side down on small plate in puddle of avocado oil/lime mix wrap in plastic. Stayed green overnight! :)
5209 2018-10-29 13:55:10 Ahhhhh we trade with Brazil more, Saudis less.... 

We give Saudi land to the Russians. 

China gets to watch. 

Less boats less oil spills, everybody happy.
5210 2018-10-29 13:55:09 Haha 
There it is ‘ oil money ‘ ....
And do YOU realise Manchester City are a self sustaining business and have been for 3/4 years ? 

Fucking Oil money 
5211 2018-10-29 13:55:05 Trump's words do not move me or uplift me.  If anything I now feel his words are causing me to feel I suffer with a malignant disease. Kellyanne Conway can continue to take Trump's snake oil but I discourage everyone not to.
5212 2018-10-29 13:54:59 It really is the oil that is the most disturbing thing about this.
5213 2018-10-29 13:54:58 พี่เคยเห็นๆ มาแบบหอยสังข์ใหญ่ๆอ่ะ แต่ๆๆๆ ไม่กล้ากิน
5214 2018-10-29 13:54:53 If inflation is largely fiscal, why did inflation rise so rapidly after the oil price shocks of 1973 and the late 1970s?

5220 2018-10-29 13:54:11 Perhaps best case scenario is the beginning of the end of austerity. Turning the fiscal oil tanker around will be a long slow process. I expect new era of higher taxation to begin with some fiscal painkillers thrown out today.
5221 2018-10-29 13:54:11 "Angela Merkel" Causing the ruin of the EU's economic powerhouse will put her in the history books. Allowing an invasion of false refugees, destroying Germany's ability produce its own power, forcing the country to buy oil from Russia. Your departure is 10+ years too late.

Oh and also you can ingest green health. Any oil that has the nutritional info you can take but always talk to ur doc

5227 2018-10-29 13:53:32 For me the cost of my medicine has gone down.
Three years ago a year of my medicine was $200.
Saturday I got a two year supply for $216.
I don’t waste my time or money on buds. I only buy concentrates (hash and hash oil). Buds simply does not provide the consistent relief I need.

5229 2018-10-29 13:53:22 So? Most of Ted’s money comes from the 1% and special interest groups like oil and gas or the NRA. 
Beto is raising it $1 at a time from people who like his message. 
Ted is raising it $1 million at a time from groups he will owe favors to.
5230 2018-10-29 13:53:22 Roughly 63 percent of world oil is transported by sea. #Transpillar
5231 2018-10-29 13:53:20 Give us some of your oil and we will all be awake but the wise shed go and buy oil for your lamps from the others then our lamb shall be low too so while the unwise was going and buying the oil the door was open and the wise endured the door the foolish was left out in the world
5232 2018-10-29 13:53:11 This is great btw, What oil paint did you use? Trying to find new acrylics/oils to use
5233 2018-10-29 13:53:07 Oil diffusers are amazing!!!
5234 2018-10-29 13:53:07 So you don't believe in any country being independent. Just Scotland. I wonder why? Because you STEAL 40% of our revenue, 92% of our gas & oil revenue, STEAL 24 important powers?  Or just b/c you're a wee TROLL??
5235 2018-10-29 13:53:03 got an oil spot on my pantsssss

5237 2018-10-29 13:52:57 In ancient Greece, wealthy children used to be dipped in olive oil at birth so they could be hairless throughout their entire lives.

5245 2018-10-29 13:51:53 I started when I was 21. Went into the military at 26. Got out at 28. Been in the oil field since.
5246 2018-10-29 13:51:52 Over the past few years Brazil surpassed Venezuela and Mexico in oil production. They have reasonable oil reserves and several foreign oil companies are allow to invest there. Brazil is working hard to come out of a recession caused by political mistakes.
5247 2018-10-29 13:51:49 When I say I only want a oil change that’s what I mean!! Don’t come giving me no estimate talking about $400 for brake fluids and shit 
5248 2018-10-29 13:51:49 We cannot work with a party that betrays it's own ideals.
2018, the Republican party is no longer Conservative.
Republicans in office just lie... a lot.

Democrats? Extreme, might be calling for universal income or abolishing all oil companies by 2024.
Liberal extremes? 
5249 2018-10-29 13:51:46 I take the opposite as shale is not about oil, is about developing new technology. In this case, new technology to bring hydrocarbons to production .
5250 2018-10-29 13:51:44 覚えていてえらいから褒めて差し上げます。
5251 2018-10-29 13:51:21 untuk make up remover atau bersihin wajah dari kotoran, aku pake garnier yang ada oil nya mantul
5252 2018-10-29 13:51:16 @LandOLakesInc  I usually buy your butter/olive oil/sea salt. 
I won’t be buying again. As you contribute to @SteveKingIA.
I cannot image supporting hate.
5253 2018-10-29 13:51:13 I’m 34. I was over the road for 6 years. I work in the oil field now.

5256 2018-10-29 13:50:48 Well, The USA seems to go with the guys who have money and oil over the middle class and poor who live in a desert without oil and money. It is time to stop using our money to support atrocities around the world. That's why we have refuges. We are to blame for all these refuges.
5257 2018-10-29 13:50:48 If your sneezing is from allergies U can make a smoothie that will help with that. Banana, pineapple cubes, honey, ice cubes, half a cup of water, chia seeds (optional) Make sure ingredients are organic. 

You should also go online and look up black seed oil to protect U from flu
5258 2018-10-29 13:50:40 Let me go get my oil changed before I blow my damn engine... AGAIN

5263 2018-10-29 13:50:22 Drink a lot of water , then rub the side of your head with Green Oil... It works for me,  cause i don't do pills too.
5264 2018-10-29 13:50:18 so wild... oil lobbyists know how much floridians value their vaping
5265 2018-10-29 13:50:14 Perhaps that was too complex for you? I'll try again. What does the western craving for oil have to do with the 1400 years of islamic, expansionist war against the infidel, as called for in the quran? 

Or, I might ask: why you are commenting on something you know nothing about?
5266 2018-10-29 13:50:10 อย่างตลกเอาอัลบั้มอึนจีไปแลกซื้อของ?

โทษนะฮ่ะซื้อไปถมที่เหรอ แซว
5267 2018-10-29 13:49:57 Ouch! Sorry to hear that you had that happen. Something that can help is loosening the adhesive with household oils like baby oil.

5273 2018-10-29 13:48:59 What are you justifying please.
When oil was selling at its peak and you were making money in trillions,
On what bases were you borrowing?
Were you borrowing to keep all your projects uncompleted
Were u borrowing to fund the greed of the bandits that made up ur party?
Park well!
5274 2018-10-29 13:48:26 That bottle we saw on the way out was a bottle of Lucas oil. I picked it up.
5275 2018-10-29 13:48:22 And YOU do realise that city, in the last 8years are the biggest spending club in the world? They've spent 3 times what Madrid have, yet Madrid have won 4 champions leagues in that time. It's simply oil money, nothing else
5276 2018-10-29 13:48:19 anyways i’m gonna go make some noodle soup and add nori and sesame oil bc that shit is delicious goodbye
5277 2018-10-29 13:48:18 But the entire reason for SDF's DeZ campaign is purely a political one, and that is obtaining the oil fields to put pressure on Damascus.
Those oil fields belong by right to Syria, and are badly needed to resurrect Syria's economy.

5285 2018-10-29 13:47:07 "They said palm oil destroys habitat and virgin forest so they boycott it, but we in malaysia,we care for our environment, some 48% of our country remain as virgin jungle, can our boycotters say the same for their country?" Damn Tun M firing some shots 
5286 2018-10-29 13:47:04 I understand. I just can’t accept that it’s happening. It’s as heartbreaking as watching the Exxon oil spill & thousands of volunteers washing seagulls w/Dawn. If we feed the manatees, they’ll become dependent & die when we stop & if we don’t feed them, they’ll die. That’s awful
5287 2018-10-29 13:46:51 I thought countries put pressure on OPEC and now they are producing oil again at the highest rate they ever have at the moment after choking production down to trickle two/three years ago
5288 2018-10-29 13:46:39 America knew that white supremacist groups were a threat over 20 years ago!

5294 2018-10-29 13:46:13 The root cause is in the necessity. Your need for oil based products is your need. Companies supply products that attend your needs. We can reduce that need by, for example, buying electric cars. 

Creating, better, alternatives is the way to go.
5295 2018-10-29 13:46:11 LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers continued to
liquidate former bullish positions in oil last week and for the
first time in more than a year clear signs of fresh
short-selling emerged.
5296 2018-10-29 13:46:10 I am a legal immatant. I did it the legal way. If I can put forth the effort to do so, so should they. This is an insult to me! We all know the root of this invasion..VOTES!! Sell your snake oil somewhere else ORourke!

By the time TLC gets here we will have had 15 PPV’s this year. 

That oil money changed Vince’s mind quick 
5304 2018-10-29 13:45:02 God bless you this morning Sharon.  Sorry if I miss quoted you. May God shine his light upon your feet and pour oil upon your head. May you be in good health and peace within your heart. In Jesus name I pray

5307 2018-10-29 13:44:38 The comms agenda re onshore oil & gas was seized by the environmental lobby due to the avarice and false promises of a number of first movers and true believers on the upstream side. What could have been positive is now defensive and nastily tribal.

5311 2018-10-29 13:44:10 I would say lather your hair in conditioner and oil. Massage it through to your scalp and put a cap on. For future wigs, use a thicker dome cap or use 2 mesh caps. Also, use a styrofoam mannequin head. That’ll let it dry before putting it on your head

5320 2018-10-29 13:42:00 No one chooses where their born, or what ideologies their home nation holds. A lot of soldiers aren’t that privy to why they are fighting. Look at the mess that the oil wars in the Middle East have caused. More war, more death. All the children who have been killed...
5321 2018-10-29 13:42:00 Idk if this is a Hispanic thing but you let it get a little brown in some cooking oil and throw in tiny pieces of garlic and onion for flavor if you want. Mix it around while it’s in the cooking oil .After some rice looks light golden brown you add your water, then add salt .

5326 2018-10-29 13:41:32 There is a strong social pressure when prices go up in local currency. Left wing Governments abuses and corruption almost bankrupted Petrobras -State oil  company. Its privatization if accomplished by the newly elected President may bring huge investments to the oil industry.
5327 2018-10-29 13:41:27 Just accept it - technology is the new oil and Israel is the new OPEC (you). By the way - shukran to Abu Dhabi- it’s been great seeing Israeli’s win so many medals.

5403 2018-10-29 13:32:14 1/2 I’m going to disagree with much of this. Seasoning is not oil filling “pores” of cast iron. (Cast Iron is not porous)

The oils or fats must be heated beyond oil’s smoke point to polymerize it and form a hardened “nonstick” surface...

5443 2018-10-29 13:26:45 Don't try to deflect. You claimed that the relatively recent, western craving for oil has brought about islamic terrorism here in the West and elsewhere in the world. What does oil lust have to do with the quranic promise of : paradise after death if you kill infidels?

5463 2018-10-29 13:24:03 The oil companies don't care about our land, our water, our air or our health. YES on 1631.
5464 2018-10-29 13:24:02 Professional wrestling and "progressive" politics are like oil and water, they just don't mix.
5465 2018-10-29 13:24:00 These parts for the Cutty should be here today. But I ain’t got no tools! I fuccin hate tweakers!! And I gotta change Betty oil and the Honda’s oil!  I hope he get a bad batch of dope and dies on the street somewhere 
5466 2018-10-29 13:23:55 I’m mad as shit rite now then the nerve for her truck to take synthetic oil hat why it’s so high
5467 2018-10-29 13:23:51 Who wants to see why ourhemp oil  is different because of BIOABSORB technology and why it works like it does!?? I have a video showing you the difference between another brand on the market and what I use now!!!!! 
5468 2018-10-29 13:23:48 Really? Try working in a oil patch.

5473 2018-10-29 13:23:20 La France est une construction capétienne puis jacobine autour de l'identité francienne (langue d'oïl) étendue aux pays d'oc. Cette identité francienne existe et est à préserver mais elle n'est pas une frontière.
5474 2018-10-29 13:23:01 How corrupt and misinformed of @SkyNewsAust to e spreading false info about climate change. Believe the scientists not the corrupt oil industry
5475 2018-10-29 13:22:49 Oil paint filter. Makes it look like a painting.
5476 2018-10-29 13:22:45 Just here for the ratio while I oil my AR.
5477 2018-10-29 13:22:43 total BS.  There is no connection between sugar and those chronic diseases.  Oil, fat, animals products are all the main culprits.
5478 2018-10-29 13:22:37 he is doing all this because his minisers use olive oil and honey regularly so he don't want drunk ministeres in girls schools :)
5479 2018-10-29 13:22:30 That figure for I port is way high I'd say also.. Most of petrol etc is tax and VAT.. Like here in Ireland.. Countries that have oil don't tax anywhere near as much if any.

5486 2018-10-29 13:21:50 The Western craving for oil is what inspired Mohammed to slaughter, conquer & enslave much of the Christian world. As well as putting the 100 or so tenets into the quran that command the killing of infidels?
5487 2018-10-29 13:21:43 My moma fuckin luck she been nice letting me use her truck cuz between a new battery $157 + $80 for a oil change
5488 2018-10-29 13:21:35 This is every time I need an oil change and my parents trip because I blew up my last car cause I forgot to change the oil

5492 2018-10-29 13:21:20 3 months ago, I was lazy and went somewhere new for an oil change.

5504 2018-10-29 13:20:01 I've been using peppermint essential oil when I have a headache! 1 tablespoon of water + 3 drops and I apply I on my temples/ along my hairline
It honestly helps a lot
5505 2018-10-29 13:20:00 Like the actual threats from your pals on Gab eh? 

We know you're a total chickenshit peddling snake oil insurance policies to unwitting families across the South and calling it #winning

when you block us, just remember that we see through your veneer into the dark abyss
5506 2018-10-29 13:19:59 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
5507 2018-10-29 13:19:56 Coconut oil = comedogenic (may clog your pores). Baking soda may irritate your skin. Chemical yg lagi merbahaya kepda kulit.

5509 2018-10-29 13:19:40 The wait be so freaking long for an oil change 
5510 2018-10-29 13:19:32 I use coconut oil...sometimes I laugh about it tho.  So, you are saying if i get more serious about putting coconut oil on my face, you will love me?   Market Buy order incoming.

5537 2018-10-29 13:16:48 They're still working on the details? 

"We are continuing to work with BHGE with the view to entering into definitive agreement(s) that will define our mutual cooperation, which may include the Company contributing to the venture via sharing of its oil and gas production"
5538 2018-10-29 13:16:44 That’s because they don’t need to import the oil. It’s already there. I heard we pay the price we pay because 60% of what we pay is actually import cost per litre...true cost of our petrol/diesel is only about 70-80p/litre
5539 2018-10-29 13:16:41 Peak Oil anyone?
5540 2018-10-29 13:16:37 No.... Not really. But there were lot of Indian oil people in my society
5541 2018-10-29 13:16:35 That happened to us a few years ago when we had the really bad snow and an ancient military quarter with oil fired central heating - fun it was not! But hey they gave us two electric heaters to tide us over which worked brilliantly in a six-bed house!!
5542 2018-10-29 13:16:29 WHAT is it that angers Russia & China about USA? Fighting over territory, oil, economics, democracy calls, or global leadership? Im gonna research this this week, cause theres NO reason 4 the extreme ill-will that ONLY economic ties protects us from war, N many cases! #Idiocy
5543 2018-10-29 13:16:26 Agree regards the new Brazil president. BBC had an analysts on R4, he said the new president is all for Finance, oil (mining) international companies and regards protected forests he is of the persuasion  of "cut and burn". HZM will be fine then.
5544 2018-10-29 13:16:19 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but is now at large.

5575 2018-10-29 13:12:53 Yes. I saw Saskatchewan having higher levels than Alberta, which might point away from oil industry but mean to dig further as said. Towards the end of the year, we're adding SO2 data and updating the NO2 data to cover a longer period, will be wiser then.

5583 2018-10-29 13:12:05 Besides, Nathan, what makes you think that oil and coal companies have the vaguest interest in transitioning to clean energy?  They want to continue as they have, which is why they fight so hard against regulation, etc.  I-1631 might not be perfect, but it is better than nothing.

5606 2018-10-29 13:08:40 Mallam hassan, We are alive, hale and hearty when a Nigerian oil vessel  sailed out on the international waters and was never heard of again.  I dont want to call out names, but Buhari isn’t a party of, neither did he connive with those ppl who dismantled Nigeria Airways.
5607 2018-10-29 13:08:26 เเต่ทั้งนี้ก็ไม่ชอบที่ตัวเองใส่เเว่นเหมือนกัน
5608 2018-10-29 13:08:20 6 years and 29 days  since  ( October -2013)
5609 2018-10-29 13:08:08 คนโต ๆกันแล้ว เค้าไม่มางอแงกับเรื่องแค่นี้หรอก 
ฮึบ
5610 2018-10-29 13:08:00 But as a tamilian I can answer..my granny used to tell us take oil bath,  wear new clothes, start to burst crackers all before sun rise..myth was that narakasuran shouldn't see sun rise... Which also happens to be amavasai..
5611 2018-10-29 13:07:58 จบแล้ววหรอ เหมือนไปดูที่โน้นเลย
5612 2018-10-29 13:07:56 今回もお会いできるの楽しみにしてました！

5613 2018-10-29 13:07:46 ありがとうございます！
5614 2018-10-29 13:07:42 Venezuela economy is tied to the price of oil. This is the same standard the GOP is trying to keep us on. It’s cost many Americans lives and has come close to bankrupting this country. Maybe it’s time to move on including replacing you!
5615 2018-10-29 13:07:38 .@drchatterjeeuk really enjoying your podcast and loved @miguelmateas insight into gut health and his love of olive oil! I have recently switched from olive to British rapeseed oil for ethical reasons but I wanted to know are the health benefits similar?
5616 2018-10-29 13:07:33 อยากกินบัวลอยโมจิของเอ็มเคอ่ะ 
งั่กกก
5617 2018-10-29 13:07:31 Just up pullin’ oil from the ground for you lovely folks.
5618 2018-10-29 13:07:19 I need to get this oil change.
5619 2018-10-29 13:07:18 Kebalik nder jd urutannya face oil, moist, baru obat jerawat. Saranku sih cukup pake yg oxy 10 aja takutnya malah iritasi kulitmu kalo digabung gitu
5620 2018-10-29 13:07:15 So I find out today that @Subaru  there was a class action lawsuit over oil consumption in their vehicles. No one @CioccaSubaru breathed a word. My Outback eats oil. They need to #makeitright  So done. @SubaruCustCare
5621 2018-10-29 13:07:06 イヤァーーーー　グワーーーーッ　（そのうち委託とかあります…よね…）
5622 2018-10-29 13:06:46 合わないだけなんだろうけど、何度見ても萎えるなここは
5623 2018-10-29 13:06:41 Oil money will not last another 100 years, so no good buisness plan.
5624 2018-10-29 13:06:39 Chaiiiii, I feel u ehn, please just accept ur predicament for now, the #6,500 can't buy the engine oil Benz needs. U can go to sambisa to buy chibok fairly used bicycle.
5625 2018-10-29 13:06:34 Plus d oil scent....chai
5626 2018-10-29 13:06:34 もうこれで大団円かな、が何度も覆される展開には脱帽ですよ。でもなのはさんに関してはラストバトルの渾身の右ストレートがですねｗ
5627 2018-10-29 13:06:24  glad we’re not all the same...maybe the future is EV but the present isn’t and until the electricity is all renewable aren’t you just still burning gas/coal/oil at the power stations to provide the electricity? I’m cutting out the middleman.
5628 2018-10-29 13:06:20 Oil is already running out in lighter
My stomach is nervously burning inside

Meltdown, iroha
5629 2018-10-29 13:06:19 It's like a variant of a coconut oil bath but yay, IT'S GROSS AS HELL (do not recommend)

5632 2018-10-29 13:05:57 Yes, add oil!
5633 2018-10-29 13:05:55 仕事は普通にちゃんと行ってるし、仕事中死ぬほど眠くなるのは生理前とか夜更かししたときだけだから()
5634 2018-10-29 13:05:47 Thought you were going to whip out that oil money
5635 2018-10-29 13:05:45 then after oil was discovered they were forced out again
5636 2018-10-29 13:05:42 จะอ่านเจอบ่อยๆ ว่าคนสายตาสั้นมากๆ บางคนจะรู้สึกชอบเวลาถอดเเว่นมองให้ภาพมันเบลอๆ คือจริงๆ เวลามองไฟมองถนนเเบบถอดเเว่นมันก็สวยจริงเเหละ เเต่นี่ติดเเว่นมาก ใส่ตลอด ถ้าถอดคือหมดความมั่นใจในการเดินทันที ต่อให้เห็นพื้นก็รู้สึกว่ามันต้องสะดุดมันต้องล้มเเน่ๆ ถ้าไม่มีเเว่นคือไม่ต้องไปไหน
5637 2018-10-29 13:05:28 @Cookiiedivine Hey. Any thoughts on CBD oil as treatment for joint pain and arthritis in dogs? 
Lots of info out there is from drugs companies, any studies?
5638 2018-10-29 13:05:26 Baby oil and sit your head under hot water .
5639 2018-10-29 13:05:22 Basket case since oil was discovered there.
5640 2018-10-29 13:05:20 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
5641 2018-10-29 13:05:07 RT @charliekirk11: JUST THIS YEAR under President Trump, the U.S. has become:

The world’s most competitive economy

Energy independent

The leading exporter of oil to the world

… Why would anybody vote for Democrats who have promised to reverse all of this?

5643 2018-10-29 13:04:45 oh my god I’ve been trying the oil cleansing method for a week now and my skin has been nothing but wonderful to me oh my god I feel so powerful
5644 2018-10-29 13:04:41 My family has been big oil for over a century. We own close to a million acres in 13 states of oil and nat gas land. We are privy to whats happening, our estate has a seat with Shell for board votes. But yeah, im delusional on it....
5645 2018-10-29 13:04:40 Ooooo..... I’m sure that the big Petrol companies are very scared..
Btw the price of oil is already dropping so it won’t @ScottMorrisonMP who will get the prices down ...

5648 2018-10-29 13:03:55 Read the article closely. Bribery. Golden Agri is billion $ company. Sinar Mas & others R subsidiaries of Golden Agri. Connected to deforestation for palm oil plantations - palm oil sold to e.g. MC D, Mars, Kellogg's, Procter & Gamble+. WHAT the officials knew still in ??
5649 2018-10-29 13:03:49 I look forward to it!
5650 2018-10-29 13:03:46 Having your own car is the best thing but worst thing ever, 290 for winter tires two weeks ago, another 200/300 down the drain for this damn oil leak. Money? What is money?
5651 2018-10-29 13:03:42 Wym u don’t use olive oil for everything
5652 2018-10-29 13:03:29 เราต้องทำให้เขาเห็นว่าเราก็มีอนาคตที่ดีและมั่นคงได้ ไม่ใช่เหยียบขี้ไก่ไม่ฝ่อแบบที่เขาดูถูก.

5654 2018-10-29 13:03:19 What are you going to do ... sell it off to Big Gas & Oil or Mining Interests or to Big Lumber? After all it's self-interest over party. It's party over country. The corruption is so rampant in this corrupt admin & you are at the top of the list of most corrupt. Swamp Monster!
5655 2018-10-29 13:03:10 On Saturday I survived an a vehicular accident scare..an oil truck almost ran into a bus I was in..it showed how short life his..people were struggling to get out of the bus in a highway it was ridiculous
5656 2018-10-29 13:03:03 Always need snake oil
5657 2018-10-29 13:02:54 CBD oil is gold! I combine it with mindfullness and it is such a powerfull combo! I would have died from stress otherwise 
5658 2018-10-29 13:02:53 Trouble with headlice? They HATE lavender, buy the oil, mix with water, add to a spray bottle, apply generously everyday #LifeHacks
5659 2018-10-29 13:02:43 It was the original Ulster Scots  poster I was referring to as the tit. I thought you were retweeting it to highlight the absurdity of taking offence. You’re no oil painting yourself.
5660 2018-10-29 13:02:40 Tell exxon especially rex that our oil is not on sale. Wish good trade between our countries.
5661 2018-10-29 13:02:35 Scientists have found that crude oil exposure early in fish development can lead to long-term consequences, including mortality months after fish are removed to uncontaminated water and brain changes that are apparent for nearly a year after exposure.
5662 2018-10-29 13:02:34 After 10 games in the 2011/12 season, they were second in the conference. Then what happened? Let's just take it a little bit at a time. Also, think the Oilers could handle losing McDavid like the Leafs have to deal with losing Matthews?
5663 2018-10-29 13:02:20 C’est l’annonce d’augmenter le gaz oil jusqu’en 2022 qui met le feu au poudre .
Rappellez vous il y a trois ans on nous incitait à acheter diesel.

5665 2018-10-29 13:02:14 Wueh, oil control is the hardest. Constantly powdering your foundation.
5666 2018-10-29 13:02:03 พอโตขึ้นมาไม่คิดว่าจะโดนครอบครัวตีกรอบให้ขนาดนี้ จากเมื่อก่อนครอบครัวนี่เป็นครอบครัวสมัยใหม่ เปิดโอกาสไปกีดกั้น แต่พอนี่ได้ลาออกจากงานเดิมบวกกับที่เขาไปดูดวงมาว่านี่จะเกิดอุบัติเหตุ บลาๆ หลังจากนั้นมาเขาเริ่มตีกรอบเขียนชีวิตให้เราเลย แถมดูถูกเราอีกว่าไปได้เป็นท่าไหม อึดอัด

5670 2018-10-29 13:01:28 America has; destabilized nations, murdered civilians, assassinated heads of state, installed dictators, supported oppressive regimes, interfered in elections, invaded nations to steal OIL & used the military as mercenaries! Who will sanction America? #Venezuela #Libya #Egypt

5676 2018-10-29 13:00:56 I get that. But hoping ppl see my quote and focus on prevention. Hope you feel better--I left ideas abt oils on your main thread. When I had pneumonia and antibiotics didn't work oregano oil did. I swesr by it now.
5677 2018-10-29 13:00:54 people that told us Buhari couldn't manage our economy but i asked how forex shortages of 2016 disappeared immediately we grew our reserves above $40b? no response, among d 3 top oil producers in Africa dat landed in recession due to lack of savings, Nigeria was first to recover.
5678 2018-10-29 13:00:53 NARS has a really good primer that doesn’t let oil through check it out maybe it’ll help you

Tribal warfare w/shifting allegiances Hamas, Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS, oil wealth

5690 2018-10-29 12:59:15 I shall say that one in bed tonight..
5691 2018-10-29 12:59:02 Also oregano oil is both antiviral and antibacterial. So is eucalyptus and clove. You can mix those and rub on your feet but use olive oil as a base because both clove and oregano are hot oils. If the oils you get are therapeutic you can also ingest them but check w a doc
5692 2018-10-29 12:59:00 They could / would never admit such. Don't wait for it.
The arsonist stands by and proclaims his innocence. It was the kindling and the oil that caused the fire, not me.
5693 2018-10-29 12:58:57 Bill is trying to balance the panel but there has to be someone who actually can get to the point in less than an hour. Besides, after I listen to him I feel like need a shower to get the oil off.

5695 2018-10-29 12:58:49 One man's food is another man's poison, I bet that's an idiom.
5696 2018-10-29 12:58:43 Could it be that in the scramble for control of oil. "Christian" countries have set the Middle East ablaze. We've supported dictators so long as they were useful and compliant and fermented bloody wars when they ceased to be so. You're disgusting.
5697 2018-10-29 12:58:38 Do you consider yourself a Christian? Funny how folks blame Venezuela on "socialism" & not rampant government corruption coupled with a 70% drop in oil prices since 2014 - the entire engine of the Venezuel econ...yet curiously omit where it's working well - even in South America.
5698 2018-10-29 12:58:31 Si on a pas besoin de rouler trop car les hausses du gaz oil jusqu’à 2022 fait flipper dans les zones rurales.
5699 2018-10-29 12:58:29 Much like oil in the 20th century, slavery was the economic engine of the 19th century. One would be hard-pressed to find a single western nation that did not profit directly or indirectly from the North-Atlantic slave trade.
5700 2018-10-29 12:58:27 Almond oil before you go to bed will lighten that tf up 
5701 2018-10-29 12:58:24 So we can agree that the solutions are small-scale biomass boilers burning wood chips from well managed forests. Mixted with wind & solar. Better than oil, coal or nuclear energy.
5702 2018-10-29 12:58:23 Listening to @CFigueres talk about “exponential curve of solutions” to climate change. Including investors fleeing from the coal sector and the drop in demand in oil with the electrification of transport. #oxfordmartin

5711 2018-10-29 12:57:40 It’s Monday morning, I’m laying on the couch beside my essential oil diffuser watching the good witch. I thought I’d be a lot of things in my life, but a 45 year old Christian woman who thinks she’s “edgy” wasn’t one of them. How did we get here

5741 2018-10-29 12:53:32 ❀•

It is surely strange for a human being to stay calm when someone yelled at them like Kana. She obviously knows that she has made the other angry , she's an empath after all.

But since she knows that it's bad to pour oil into flame , she chooses to remain composed.

5750 2018-10-29 12:52:10 Goodbye Toronto. After just a day and a half here, I'm now on my way to Ottawa, to meet members of Parliament to raise awareness about the erosion of freedom, human rights, the rule of law and autonomy in Hong Kong. As my Hong Kong friends would say, I will "add oil"! :)

5756 2018-10-29 12:51:26 How did we manage to borrow so much between 2011- 2015 when oil prices were record high and no significant infrastructure built. How?

5759 2018-10-29 12:51:15 Why is everyone acting so shocked? The Saudi's have silence the media, Women , gays and non muslims for years. Every US Admin. ( rep and dems) have been complicit for decades follow the money find the oil find the answers.

5761 2018-10-29 12:51:04 So no one says anything when the oil pipeline was going through Djibouti. But as soon as somaliland gets mentioned every one is crying. What’s the difference we both Somali at the end of the day let us eat.

5766 2018-10-29 12:50:19 If your actual engine went out you would smell smoke or see oil or fluid leaking, or possibly see it overheat. Could be fuel pump like you said, alternator, or battery. If it’s was your alternator your dash light would come on and you would lose all power.

5768 2018-10-29 12:50:13 Because Magaya is a fake prophet who got rich by selling people trinkets and oil by playing illusions on/with their minds into believing his quackery. For once, I hope and trust the Govt of Zim will deal decisively with this nonsense. Our people should also stop being gullible.

5826 2018-10-29 12:42:53 Remember when the world boycotted Shell Oil in the 1980s because of its support for apartheid in South Africa? Well this is kind of like that, only in our own backyard, because we don’t want racism and totalitarianism in our nation.

Hi, I'm a very creative boozy bot that 's there for you when the price of the cocktail mix isn't.

5899 2018-10-29 12:33:55 No worries, China will pay off some of their debt in exchange for their oil, soul, and changing their currency so it’s backed by the yuan
5900 2018-10-29 12:33:37 At this point Chicago needs a prayer book, mounds of blessing oil, a voodoo priest, a shaman, the Buckingham Palace Guards, and the National Guard. The shootings and killings there outnumber NYC's rates. Tragic! Smh.

5907 2018-10-29 12:33:09 "Cute." He teased softly, dropping the potatoes in the oil so they could cook for a few minutes. Cal smiled and turned to press a soft kiss to his temple. "Thank you."

5919 2018-10-29 12:31:38 The markets has consistently moved down for a week. The short term demand was up reflecting the first cold weather of the winter. Oil dropped back most of last week as the global economy looked at a slowdown. Other down pressure came from the positive comments on LNG availability

5992 2018-10-29 12:22:26 There's no truth to what you're saying. You are quoting all Lib reporting. The 2.45% cut in ST. income taxes wasn't the problem KS faced, it was Oil Prices falling from $100 per barrel 2 abt $50 per barrel! In 2015 GDP for Kansas was only .02%! Tax cuts had nothing to do with it!
5993 2018-10-29 12:22:21 Could it be because they use peanut oil in combination with toxic chemicals in vaccines for children? Maybe some genius could look into this and actually do some reporting

6001 2018-10-29 12:21:29 That tweet is a 100% admission that the points I have made are the reality. You ought to have more faith in your team's chances - and just a side note, I'm not a Manchester City fan, no way sir. Bunch of oil mercenaries.
6002 2018-10-29 12:21:16 It isn't though... They don't want to lose out on the money and access to the oil people. They don't care about the situation. That is it. It really isn't complicated. It is very clear what happened and it has been admitted too.

Sadly, people will die because of the claims made by these fake prophets.

6026 2018-10-29 12:18:27 It's not whataboutism. I don't care if they all are critiqued because they deserve some of it. You spend all that money, the people can talk badly of you. Obviously it's wrong to threaten them. But most people hate the money part of it, or the oil, or promoting socialism.

6184 2018-10-29 11:56:39 Yep. Didn't play them much when they were down in league 1 before the oil money came in not so many years ago.
6185 2018-10-29 11:56:36 Why is it the automatic reflex of most media and all democrats to blame Trump for hurricanes, racial discord, mass murders, acne, high oil prices, civil disorder, the plight of illegal immigrants, etc. ?
6186 2018-10-29 11:56:29 My missus raves about Cbd oil,might help take the edge off?

He's not an uneducated person... He knows he is saying BS to us all.

Our Constitution IS quite clear about who is "working" for who...   RBC , and Oil Industry are not Canada boss.

6197 2018-10-29 11:55:25 Yeah, under one condition that the oil price is high. When the wind lose strength then comes the heat.

6199 2018-10-29 11:55:09 UK government pushing for 'Hydrogen trains' - no doubt at the behest of oil companies; we get Hydrogen for the most part from Natural Gas so it's great for Big Oil's bottom line (and justifies fracking)

6202 2018-10-29 11:54:43 People were stupid enough to elect trump and the republicans.  Many of them appear to have learned from their own stupidity and decided that the snake oil doesn't cure what ails them.
6203 2018-10-29 11:54:38 No it’s really exclusive like that time I got my oil changed 
6204 2018-10-29 11:54:35 add oilしていること。

6216 2018-10-29 11:53:35  @PhilipHammondUK can send a clear message today that this government remains firmly on the side of the North Sea oil and gas industry. @ScotTories MPs have been lobbying the Chancellor and his colleagues in Treasury at every opportunity to make sure that happens #Budget2018

6218 2018-10-29 11:53:17 Well said Brian, fascist government in Ukraine has been indeed endorsed and supported by the western states+ their media to an alarming degree.  Shame on all of them. They have no regard for life at all, the poor people of Ukraine are pawns in a power game for oil pipelines etc
6219 2018-10-29 11:53:14 The NDP government still supports oil and gas development. Do you not listen to the news? Or do you just listen to Kenney, that poor excuse of a premier wannabe?  And the NDP did not kill the pipeline, it was stopped by a judge following a court case.

6222 2018-10-29 11:52:21 As a country, only about 11% of our oil comes from #SaudiArabia now. It keeps dropping drastically as we cut our dependence, so they no longer can use that as a threat against us. We'd survive quite well without them as bed partners.

6287 2018-10-29 11:42:59 There is no correlation between taxation and Venezuela's situation.   That's insane. Venezuela's collapse is mostly down the country's over reliance on a single market (oil), and failing to diversify before prices crashed.

#Hydrogen is currently made from #fossil fuels by large companies.
It doesn’t come from #renewables, made by small businesses.
It’s not beneficial for the #BigShift.

6618 2018-10-29 10:56:27 Humm.....wonder how fiercely British they'll be when the oil filter for their VW costs x2 in 2021 while tucking into their US chlorinated chicken. Or before that when Brexit's tanked the GB£ and inflation's 10% and their mortgages are going through the roof.

6620 2018-10-29 10:56:09 You probably forecasted such things many times before on your twitter recently, but since I'm too lazy to dig up your timeline, do you feel oil price is gonna fall anytime soon ?
6621 2018-10-29 10:56:03 Think I might buy a cheap set of oils paints and have a go at oil painting. 
6622 2018-10-29 10:56:01 Buhari has no stake in Nigeria. He doesn't care. He has mortgaged the oil to the Chinese. So selling off the remaining means nothing to him.

It really detangles it. I have never had it this easy combing my hair. I would have agreed to promote it for her if it was awful
6652 2018-10-29 10:51:13 RJ and Pierre are spot on...enough with the Broncos jersey. The guy has a statue infront of Lucas Oil stadium for crying out loud!
6653 2018-10-29 10:51:11 Why does it have to be oils? The point I'm trying to make is that palm oil has been introduced into products which never used to contain it - *including* (at least in my local supermarket) ready made 'all butter' pastry.
It was introduced to cut costs. Unnecessary.

6666 2018-10-29 10:50:25 Not the same thing ( and not justifying that either) . If it's a prank come forward take your oil and let it be over. Otherwise it's an act of intimidation and they should be punished.
6667 2018-10-29 10:50:23 The fact that China wants to buy oil with its own currency will increasingly present Saudi Arabia with a dilemma. It could accept renminbi payments for its oil. However, this would go down where the US Treasury would (rightly) see this as a threat to the dollar’s hegemony/Gavekal

6765 2018-10-29 10:37:35 They have products to remove glue. You can try the oil or the shampoo. And for future advice if your going to make a wig either take a plastic bag and put it over your head first so it doesn't get stuck OR invest in a foam head they're literally like $1

6788 2018-10-29 10:33:00 Weekly Price Update

The underlying price of heating oil was little changed this week with only a slight increase of 0.26 p/L.

However, there are still fears over the Iranian oil sanctions which come into force in under a week.

Order your oil today. call us on 01423 396789!

6806 2018-10-29 10:29:40 In case this is helpful, I choose the “thick crust” option (fluffy), I add extra tomato sauce on the bottom & olive oil is a free topping. The crust isn’t too dry this way, at least not for me, and doesn’t cost more either. Easy to configure these options with the PizzaPizza app.

6914 2018-10-29 10:09:13 The Greeks destroyed their economy by over-borrowing, electing poor governments, failing to reform their economy & bloated public sector, failing to make anything except olive oil, failing to get rid of endemic corruption & failing to collect taxes. Then they asked for handouts.
6915 2018-10-29 10:09:13 I literally soaked my self in oil cause of this dry weather ..
6916 2018-10-29 10:09:11 That's simply not true. Oil was US$90-100 a barrel in 2013, and the AUDUSD ranged from $0.95-1.05

Yes oil is US$30 a barrel cheaper today, but the AUD is also 30% lower.
6917 2018-10-29 10:09:07 And be lazy and start just washing coconut oil from your hair.
6918 2018-10-29 10:09:03 I worked for oil major in Baku and in air lounge heard people from Houston discussing big changes to be made in org and people to be removed from positions.

6921 2018-10-29 10:07:56 Of course not! That was only the tip of the iceberg. There is also the huge scandal at our state oil firm Petrobras, which led our former president Lula, as a result of the operation "Car Wash", to jail, and who they intended to free.

6925 2018-10-29 10:07:05 we are not going to survive. ill tell you how the next 1000 years will pan out if we dont make a significant change. population will continue to rise and we'll run out of oil and start wars over the last few drops. the war will likely go nuclear and wipe out humanity.
6926 2018-10-29 10:06:20 It's not good for you, in all that oil!

6966 2018-10-29 09:59:50 so, i like putting raw coconut oil on my lips because it's shiny and cute and stuff...i went out for literally ten minutes and when i came back into my room, i noticed it had frozen on my lips. Fro-zen. England.

6977 2018-10-29 09:58:51 I’ve seen a orangutan pounding on a tractor because you’re destroying his home for palm oil. Just stop  there are other alternatives. We only have one planet, and there are no do overs.
6978 2018-10-29 09:58:16 Yep you keep sending these but the UN has recommended that the continental shelf is Argentinian including the islands. Hence the meeting in November and hence the issues will drilling for oil. Seems it all stems back to oil!
6979 2018-10-29 09:58:03 If we exchange oil for gold, hypothetically speaking South Africa would technically be the world’s largest plug. Yes 50% of the world’s gold comes from SA. Not to mention 80% of the World’s platinum too.
6980 2018-10-29 09:57:55 I just saw the dumbest cooking video ever. This person gon pour oil onto a pan, then add water... what...

6982 2018-10-29 09:57:32 Palestine would have safe areas too if that neighboring apartheid state weren't bombing it every 15 minutes. God forbid we hold Israel accountable for anything ever. Gotta keep it happy for religious tourism, oil contracts, and Jesus' return someday...

You cannot come and waste children.

6984 2018-10-29 09:57:12 Now this is somewhat worrying.

1. Do we have the regulatory framework to prevent environmental degradation? The Niger Delta no longer have a life due to pollution.

2. Can we guarantee the security of the oil explorers?

3. What are our plans for technological transfer?
6985 2018-10-29 09:56:40 Trump opened Keystone & Dakota Pipelines that Obama closed
Trump reopened coal mines that Obama closed

Trump meet with 100s & 100s of CEOs 2 bring manufacturing jobs & factories
Obama??
6986 2018-10-29 09:56:21 That’s what I’m hoping for. Been persevering with the olive oil nonsense for a couple of weeks with no luck.
6987 2018-10-29 09:55:59 For me. Ok sangat. Cleansing oil bau lemon. Lepas tu exfoliate dye rasa betul betul best bila pakai. 

Best. Lg pun oil cleansing nye totally mmg jenis oil pekat tapi habis clear sisa make up. Muka pun tak kering and tak over berminyak dah 
6988 2018-10-29 09:55:46 Good, the fact that Pence is having to go on the defensive and defend Trump means that people in the United States are finally waking up to the fact that Trump is a hate filled snake oil salesman
6989 2018-10-29 09:55:23 Olive oil utk sihat

6991 2018-10-29 09:55:07 More like syphoned off to the establishment.

I remember Thatcher giving some speech basically proclaiming that North Sea oil belonged to those that were willing to go out and stake their claim.

I also distinctly remember thinking, wait a minute, that oil is ours isn't it?!
6992 2018-10-29 09:55:04 .@antonioguterres Mexico is in position to from the annexed republic of Texas & modern Arizona claim oil concessions which in no manner were part of the deal... Mexico & Moscow should consider recovering what was exploited without their permission. Only the ICJ could say...

Increase the exports of oil and nat gas? Return to our standards of laws and order?
7010 2018-10-29 09:51:35 Venezuela went under not because of socialism, but because of government spending.They started thriving when the oil prices were at its peak, and started spending large amounts of money on military and military equipment. Corrupt governments cause failures, not helping the poor.

7027 2018-10-29 09:48:10 Point: you have no plan to fight climate change. The future of our kids depend on action against climate change. We need a leader to make tough choices like a tax and investment into green tech and moving away from fossil fuels. Not one that is bought off by big oil.
7028 2018-10-29 09:48:10 garlic and olive oil then 
7029 2018-10-29 09:48:04 Great place. I visit #Halden (#Fredrikshald till 1928) with work (oil/gas stuff). The Fortress (#FredrikstenFesting) witnessed many #GreatNorthernWar events. Halden is within a couple of miles of the bridge over Iddefjord to Sweden. Beautiful train journey down from Oslo as well
7030 2018-10-29 09:47:58 Alex you are correct this grade of olive oil is not for cooking at all, it is for dressing/finishing and even at the reduced cost of 70$ per bottle far exceeds the base cost as it put the per tonne price @ well over 9k$ so even with top end brand equity you should see price drop

7032 2018-10-29 09:47:38 You clearly don’t understand what’s happening in Venezuela. They rely much too heavily on one export product (oil), have huge debts in foreign currency, failed to invest in the real economy and are the target of economic warfare by the US and local oligarchs.
7033 2018-10-29 09:47:37 This #Vascepa supplement does not really have the expected effect on cardiovascular events. The principle fish oil can not affect these diseases. He is useless. But many doctors still hold the opposite erroneous opinion. #WorldStrokeDay #AHA18 #scam
7034 2018-10-29 09:47:27 Oil! The dosage is exact, tons of options for delivery method, doesn't stink, you can discreetly use it in public...
And while I'm SO OVER worrying about stigma, oil is a nice option for folks who want to avoid gasps by pearl-clutching family members.

7059 2018-10-29 09:42:22 So, over 10 years it's 1/30th of global gdp. For the us alone it would cost less then what we spend on the military, if spaced out over 10 years, and we would immediately see a return on our investment in the form of money we wouldn't need to spend on oil.

7068 2018-10-29 09:41:28 These guys are just trying hard to explain facts away. Majority of the loan is dollar loan and your oil revenue is in dollars

7083 2018-10-29 09:39:50 Oil Prices dipped amid cautious sentiment as a plunge in financial markets last week and dollar strength early this week underscored concerns that growth may be slowing, especially in Asia’s emerging economies.

7322 2018-10-29 08:53:35 Norway should not export oil because co2 emission from transport, they should use by themselve and go to do renewable energy to non oil country #climatechange
7323 2018-10-29 08:53:16 The important thing is really to avoid the need to dig carbon out of the ground, in the form of coal and oil.  As soon as we achieve that, we are essentially carbon neutral; all the carbon we use is absorbed by plants from the atmosphere.
7324 2018-10-29 08:53:00 Concerning!! But we must look to Venezuela though under constant attack from USA, has still managed( after strange death of Hugo Chavah?)to hold free & fair elections, we know the west will do anything to get their grubby hands on their oil!But so far no deal! Maybe another Cuba?
7325 2018-10-29 08:52:47 hmm do you sleep on that side of your face often? if so, might want to change your pillow case and wash your pillows often

it can also be oil, if you've beene eating a lot of oily stuff lately

7339 2018-10-29 08:49:55 The Supreme Court said no, that you cannot control your resources. If you are an oil producing state, take 13 per cent extra, which is derivation,” he stated.
7340 2018-10-29 08:49:48 Juxtapose that with the $13billion debt increment over a three year period (2015-2018) of low crude oil prices ($35-$80) and the achievement of both governments in terms of project delivery!! Buhari isn’t the messiah but still prefer him to Atiku and his PDP rogues

7349 2018-10-29 08:47:32 It’s just my opinion, I just can’t see anyone wanting to stump up $400m with 3 economic projections. 20%, 40% & 200% above today’s price. That would set alarms bells off to anybody. Transfer this thought process across to any commodity & it doesn’t work. Ie OIL @ $90 $105 & $225

7371 2018-10-29 08:43:48 This is the reality of this crass government. They speak of jobs and wealth yet restrict the growth and support of new technology to replace oil based fuels. Increase fuel duty, invest in greener tech to replace the vehicles, install more renewables and shut down the fracking.

7386 2018-10-29 08:39:49 Very shocking that even during the period that marked very high revenue returns for the country (2011-2014) when crude oil sold at prices above $100, our debt profile rose by $26.7billion!! All the earnings and all the borrowings yet very little to show for it!! Utter disgrace!!

7405 2018-10-29 08:36:13 Usual propaganda! Utter nonsense. When they said in 2014 as scaremongering that Scotland is running out of oil. What they really meant was England was running out of oil. All the time we have had oil for decades the oil revenue we get 0% return. So why would England think we fear
7406 2018-10-29 08:36:08 Why is he campaigning! These trade wars, cost of living increase price at the pump skyrocketing, markets in term oil, health care costs exploding but they are dangling a middle class tax cut carrot and rebranding Obama care repeals as a GOP we care carrots let see what mules bite

Especially when Scotland’s oil revenue is what helps to prop the shambles of a London economy up. But you keep believing what you read in the daily papers. 
7411 2018-10-29 08:35:29 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Get at least 7 hours sleep. Avocado is excellent for your hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? supposed to stop hair loss. or close to it. How will I discover the correct web page. Worked so well. Worth the effort.
7412 2018-10-29 08:35:26 Hi dear. This remedy works for me tho
So get a shea butter of any kind of oil, apply it on d part where d glue is and leave it on for abt 30 mins by den it should have melted the glue, den you gradually pull it. If its still stuck apply more oil that way it doesnt hurt ur hair

7463 2018-10-29 08:26:54 Um no, Globalisation  is actually about tariffs as well. Give me an example of a country that doesn't impose taxes on foreign products. The mere fact that we are affected by the rising oil, goods and steel prices meant we are part of the global trade system.

But "there is no public space" is as wholly untrue as "London has no-go zones". 
And ad hominem attacks don't help.
7600 2018-10-29 08:02:03 I'm eating yam and palm oil and my brother is eating rice and chicken, any problem?
7601 2018-10-29 08:02:02 #Libya #Libyaoil Cautious optimism in the air among Libyan oil officials: Production rising, militia disputes quiet (for now), and Italian police cracking down on European end of fuel smuggled from western ports.
7602 2018-10-29 08:01:49 I would guess, preroast chunks of squash dribble with a little olive oil in an oven. Make a sauce with chopped onions and tomato chunks ( best flavoured is the Cirio brand in the packets, rather than tins). Wilt the washed spinach very lightly in a saucepan and drain well
7603 2018-10-29 08:01:14 Can't wait for the Wade Bales Olive Oil Affair!
7604 2018-10-29 08:01:12 Why is Theresa May’s Family allowed to make huge PROFITS AS A RESULT OF HER PARLIAMENTARY DECISIONS?? She undoubtedly has a “CONFLICT OF INTEREST” with her Husband and ARMS TO SAUDI!! We must prevent MPs being influenced by BIG OIL ON FRACKING. Manipulate the LAWS TO DESTROY UK

7608 2018-10-29 08:00:30 Chanakya was writing at night with Oil Lamp. A Guest entered his house. After writing, he lit another lamp extinguished the oil lamp which was glowing.
The Guest asked Why you lit new lamp?
Chanakya said The Lamp was glowing in Government money. This lamp is glowing in my Oil.

7616 2018-10-29 07:58:14 Oil prices fall as investors wary of trade slowdown
7617 2018-10-29 07:58:14 Oil prices rolled back. Rice prices cut. Boracay rehabilitated. Plans for a new airport in Manila. Consistently good SWS approval ratings, compared to most other world leaders. The Anti-Duterte are silent now. 
7618 2018-10-29 07:57:10 Just saw some videos on the oil spill in Mubarak Village and I'm heartbroken. Why is there not a national outrage on this? The beach looks destroyed. Calamitous natural disaster prolly for the marine life, and the people depending on that location for income!!

7622 2018-10-29 07:56:36 Odd. Obama used cops to crack the heads of non violent occupy protesters 

Militarized police used terrorist tactics & tear gas on civilians

Oil police brutalized Natives peacefully protesting their land at standing rock

Right wing terrorists work for the government.

7687 2018-10-29 07:42:07 imo, a lot of denial is intended to cause fear in others. and perhaps some of the appeal of owning guns is the fear it causes in others. maybe supply side mitigation (by putting an oil company out of business) would be a constructive way to cause fear in others.

7888 2018-10-29 06:55:05 It’s not a case of the IRA being investigated. They simply have to tell the truth. Pressure needs to be put on SF from Nationalists & Republicans affected by legacy to formally get the IRA to agree to reciprocate to oil the wheels of legacy inquests. It’s not unreasonable.

2. Extra 1 year if misbehave.
3. Get non-ess USA people out first.
4. They must pay for arms deal first.

8027 2018-10-29 06:28:19 You are educated now. Those figures are cumulative! Nobody will lend Nigeria $73b in 3 years esp in the face of reduced oil price. The figures represent total to date. To know how much is borrowed in each year, you have to subtract the old figure from the new figure

8035 2018-10-29 06:25:58 I've been doing some catching up.  I see the backing of the Saudi's has a lot to do with arms deals; weapons, a lot of money, and of course oil.  Needing their support politically, and otherwise for other fights.  It was Obama who rolled over with policies there now.

8047 2018-10-29 06:22:27 You are right about Lava Jato, but the more the better; Brazil is now the 7º Biggest Economy in the World, the Biggest in Latin America and has a lot of commodities + Oil to offer. Isn't all that appealing to the far right?

8104 2018-10-29 06:09:43 I spent some time in Africa in 2014. A company was trying to bring electricity to remote parts of Kenya. At night the locals would knock the transformers off the poles and steal the oil out of them to use for cooking. They’d rather have fried chicken than electricity.

8116 2018-10-29 06:07:08 the only way to move entire companies is by threatening the jobs of everyone in the companies at once. then the companies moves en-masse. to threaten every job at once, you have to make an example of an especially egregious (growth oriented) oil company, by disbanding it.

8132 2018-10-29 06:04:32 It's just a gun to Russia's head. To get them to stand down in Syria. So the US can invade Iran. To prevent Yuan/good denominated oil deals. Protect the PetroDollar.
8133 2018-10-29 06:04:01 You're adding to the problem by focusing on issues that the democrats and liberal media point at and say "this is the problem, blame these people." Fox does this, hell some Republicans do it. But adding water to an oil fire doesn't put it out, it just spreads it.

8138 2018-10-29 06:03:18 I'm sure that it's a beautiful country, but it's also near bankrupt and has been tethering on the edge for a while... I wouldn’t compare the two but I think they are on the opposite side of broken. Greece is fixable while Syria is a flaming turd soaked in oil.

8163 2018-10-29 05:59:50 Well, they're primarily fascists, and I've always thought the acronym could easily stand for Gas and Oil Party. They use nationalism to get what they need. GOP has been doing this for some time, only before the hatred was turned mostly to POC, now it includes liberals.
8164 2018-10-29 05:59:38 I captured that second offshore airport. "You can only have one paradrop dickhead!" haha. I lost 6 oil rigs that game. Son of a bitch AI. Oil Rigs are the best way to make money. The Ore just never quite does it for me.

8196 2018-10-29 05:52:08 Why do you think we need oil and gas for showers? 85% of generation in this country is renewable. And that's a lot of power stations employing people. Stink how you care more about oil companies than people.
8197 2018-10-29 05:51:55 I’ve always struggled w acne but I had my skin pretty flawless for about six months and then I started breaking out more than ever before.

8218 2018-10-29 05:48:59 The best thing about the coconut oil is that you don't have to saturate your hair. You can melt it in your hands and comb a little in. It can stay in overnight. It leeches some hair dye out over time, but I've only noticed it with henna/indigo. Still worth it, so much.

8221 2018-10-29 05:48:18 I'd give it a shot. Use the toothbrush after letting it sit 10 minutes or so. You'll have to use the murphys after if it works cause the oil will get sticky after awhile. They're gorgeous. Looks like walnut?
8222 2018-10-29 05:48:18 It’s the only way, she just has to pour oil all over it and wait for a bit.
8223 2018-10-29 05:48:10 the only way to destroy an oil company is the direct way; simply go to the state without corporate taxes; obtain the piece of paper with the oil company's name on it; tear up the piece of paper; and sic the SEC or FBI on the oil company.
8224 2018-10-29 05:47:19 She should soak her head in oil?

8226 2018-10-29 05:47:07 The raw materials for Chicken Inn are mainly chickens, potatoes & cooking oil. However, this does not speak to equipment acquisition & repairs, dividends payments, other ingredients like pizza bases which require foreign currency so as meet international standards.

8234 2018-10-29 05:45:42 I don’t want to pay higher gas prices but if the money is to cover green jobs that’s way better than the gas prices just rising to pay oil execs and saudis which happens regularly

8247 2018-10-29 05:42:38 Last 2 years, enconomy in Brasil started to improve, not about politics but due to oil price increasing, like all  the other oil producer countries. This means that Bolsonaro "will develop brasilan's economy", and being reinforced to show the fascist he really is.

8265 2018-10-29 05:38:48 I bought @cadburysilk oreo yesterday and found out that the white wrapper was all covered with some oily stuff.

8275 2018-10-29 05:36:45 people are lazy. if the taxes can nudge us into another effort minima, we might consume constructively. nah, oil companies are anchored in place, and consumers are tethered to oil companies, so we stay destructive, until we destroy an oil company.
8276 2018-10-29 05:36:23 If they take supplements it’s okay, most pregnant women take supplements nowadays, multivitamins & oils. Vit b6 and b12 are essential for the formation of rbcs, both are found mostly in meat. Omega 3 fatty acids, a fish oil is also a great nutrient for them.

4.1% Q2 was padded by the exports of oil, steel, aluminum, corn and soybeans to beat the late June/early July tariffs.  It would have been about 3.6% w/o it.

So, as it turns out, this 3.5% Q3 has a pad that connects directly to the Q2 ‘sugar high’.

8377 2018-10-29 05:15:35 yes you're right. It's not necessary. Good luck with the offshore oil extraction. It's quite a necessarily disruptive process.
8378 2018-10-29 05:15:21 Switch to “coconut oil” as make up remover and moisturizer and you could be on that space too!
8379 2018-10-29 05:15:11 Or oil too but I believe this will work fine

8389 2018-10-29 05:13:33 Labor, probably. The part? Maybe not. A coolant or oil temperature sensor may have gone bad, or the cable connecting it and the ECU could have gone kaput. If the temperature needle on your dash doesn't move while the car is running, its probably the coolant sensor.

8442 2018-10-29 05:04:11 We moved from anointing oil to water of life 2 years ago  before the crisis of oil that took place 3weeks ago,do you have anything to say
8443 2018-10-29 05:04:08 Baby oil is good and cheaper to use to saturate in your head to remove the glue, use a warm setting on your hand dryer that will help. Massage where stuck in your head. Olive oil can be $$$ baby oil is better.

8453 2018-10-29 05:01:21 They’ve got oil and the will to keep Iran in check. That’s enough for me.

8463 2018-10-29 04:59:34 Current situation! My oil is at 5% rn, and the irony of it all... i live w/ a mechanic.. my dad!  RT @aj_fairley: females get a car and don't check the oil, tire pressure, or coolant. As long as a MF start up and radio work she ready to roll ....
8464 2018-10-29 04:59:22 I ran out of my oil pen sos
8465 2018-10-29 04:58:49 Oh yeah, I met you when my hair was short af LOL.

I don’t do anything but wash it... coconut oil once in a while to keep it moisturized. That’s about it. 
8466 2018-10-29 04:58:28 Coconut oil, dish soap, and warm/hot water. Thank me later 
8467 2018-10-29 04:57:55 Seems also like a foil for Trump to seem reasonable by comparison. Perhaps they'll compete for death squads.
The real object is Exxon's lust for Venezuelan oil and Koch's for the rain forest wood of the Amazon.  And to blunt AMLO.
8468 2018-10-29 04:57:54 So why is it so bad in South America?
Where are the profits from oil, beef and sugar going, if not to the populace?

And why, if SA is decrepit and corrupt, should we care?
8469 2018-10-29 04:57:52 #Why why do we see diced raw peppers and raw zucchini on “At site” pasta stations. Can’t we just roast them in a hot oven with some olive oil herbs and seasoning. Peeled peppers would be best. How does one eat a cross between a Greek salad and a warm pasta!
8470 2018-10-29 04:57:46 After reading Rex’s article I have come to the realization that Trudeau’s plan isn’t a anti oil plan, it’s an anti Alberta plan. He is just taking over from where his father left off.

8474 2018-10-29 04:56:52 No more disgusting than your buddies separating children from it's families, locking kids in cages, suppressing voters, gerrymandering districts, putting the oil & gas industry in charge of the EPA, allowing corruption to run rampant, enriching the wealthiest...need more?
8475 2018-10-29 04:56:48 Exactly we wanna expose more like  hot oil & sex toys .
8476 2018-10-29 04:56:38 Omg tysm 
I use African Black Soap 
Then I use witch hazel that has aloe Vera in it so it’s not so drying 
Then I use ponds blemish get correcting moisturizer and then I add a drop of vitamin E oil and tree tea and massage it all over face down to my neck.
8477 2018-10-29 04:56:34 Have you ever heard of Turkish oil wrestling?

8483 2018-10-29 04:55:14 Venezuela hasn’t been right for many years.  Their oil industry is just about sucked dry by the government.
8484 2018-10-29 04:54:53 i got this new soap for my sensitive skin and it works amazing, “ Virgin coconut oil cocoa butter”
8485 2018-10-29 04:54:29 I was dead tired yesterday so I knocked out. By the time I woke up the next morning my dad had came home with my car all washed, new set of tires, oil change and full tank
8486 2018-10-29 04:54:25 You ought to.  Oh n you need palm oil
8487 2018-10-29 04:54:12 When a reporter was harassing the former Saudi oil minister, alnuaimi, in Vienna, about climate change, he said something like “let me tell you something about climate change: it passed through my country 10,000 years ago”!
8488 2018-10-29 04:54:05 Chop four teaspoons of olive oil and cover.
8489 2018-10-29 04:54:00 Sure they will. The people in this 3rd world jurisdiction is not starving sir. Look at what's happening in Venezuela, and they have all that oil. We don't. If you don't live here, stay out of our affairs. Or come here and fight for what you believe in, and suffer the consequences

UK should be competing with Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland in terms of progressive values, median income & standard of living.
This is what Momentum is campaigning for.
To compare UK to a non-industrialized oil economy is nonsense.

8505 2018-10-29 04:49:34 To be fair, a 1+ Trillion dollar increase on military that has wasted away dumping chemicals on arabs for oil, while complaining about EBT, seems quite empty-minded.

8521 2018-10-29 04:46:53 Better just hope they've found a way to stay rich by that point, cause oil won't be around then

8527 2018-10-29 04:45:09 Reforestation is not the ONLY answer. Not even the biggest or easiest.  We need to get Wave Energy, more Hydro plants, #LFTR, and #MSR plants online ASAP and get rid of solar, wind, coal, oil & CNG plants.
8528 2018-10-29 04:45:08 yes, it's basically the Jewish version of the French quenelle.  like challah is basically brioche, but with oil instead of butter.  i'm a hamantaschen lover, esp. with the poppyseed filling (i have recipes!) but not big on kugels.  i need to rework some recipes and remedy that.
8529 2018-10-29 04:45:00 I hate the smell of lemongrass oil but it literally helps my headaches so I just pull thru but that shit literally makes me want to barf my insides out
8530 2018-10-29 04:44:52 Sis deadass need a bottle of conditioner and some hair oil... Gotta lather that shit on and just wait.

8539 2018-10-29 04:41:42 Miss you too oil  hopefully we can see again 
8540 2018-10-29 04:41:39 The beauty/skin care industry is a scam lol. How's an oil going to hydrate your skin? They repel water, they can only keep in what's in already and keep out new moisture lol.
8541 2018-10-29 04:41:23 Motor oil is a healthy laxative. Change my mind.
8542 2018-10-29 04:41:04 Yes the first one, i mean not necessarily a crashed plane, normal one if it yes im sure it causing damage to the sea and the creatures, second I guess your right about what happened the floating of oil or fuel happened after it hit the surface of the sea. This is painful
8543 2018-10-29 04:41:02 no person needs this much oil my pores need to chill

8545 2018-10-29 04:40:50 "All Alaskans" have benefitted for the last 40 years is far too generalized. The economy is structured around big oil for sure but doesn't mean we all benefit.

Corporate Alaska benefits for sure but to me truly benefitting implies well off-never will be!

8571 2018-10-29 04:37:14 Only one tear duct or set of oil glands is mad
8572 2018-10-29 04:36:57 I'm genuinely curious as to how you answer this question. Oil demand IS NOT reduced if TMX is not built

8578 2018-10-29 04:36:03 there’s a good reason villains need to explain to heroes *why* they’re hoisting them over a vat of boiling oil.
8579 2018-10-29 04:35:58 Cleansing oil biore
8580 2018-10-29 04:35:33 I don't think that is the argument. Which is better for the world?
- CO2 is produced & more oil money goes to countries using it to finance human misery
          OR
- CO2 is produced & money goes to improving lives and transitioning to a post oil world
8581 2018-10-29 04:35:21 Man I never cramp this hard or at all before  I bought some hot oil and I’m hoping this works. I really baby tf out of me when I feel like this.
8582 2018-10-29 04:35:08 Walked by a couple in target today and heard this lady’s husband asked her out loud “did you get that oil to massage your butthole yet?” And they both start laughing. That’s the way I wanna be with my future husband lol
8583 2018-10-29 04:34:53 Maybe. He likes to eat chicken himself right? Eating enough greasy food will leave a oil base on your skin or something like that. If one would you want to burn him faster just dip him in cooking grease and you'll be all set.

8592 2018-10-29 04:32:20 Between oil and conditioner it will loosen up and come right off. Be gentle and patient. For the future but a plastic cap on your actual head then the wig cap if you’re using glue to make a wig. Hope it goes well!

I had a bad side-effect experience with neurological meds where a lot of my hair fell out, and coconut oil was the only thing that helped in the long run. It just takes patience. And laundry

8668 2018-10-29 04:18:09 I also agree with CBD oil to relax & lull me off to sleep. I use stuff that's supposed to be THC free if that matters for drug testing. Used to take 2hrs to fall asleep, now maybe 10-20min. I used to use melatonin but had crazy dreams, nightmares, and/or bad sleep paralysis.

8692 2018-10-29 04:14:26 Do you not find the data overweighted in/by natural resource producing geographic areas (particularly oil)?

My point is that ‘per capita’ is a terrible metric.

You could do your part and eliminate your usage of all of the benefits that those resources have provided for you.
8693 2018-10-29 04:14:16 Gosh it would be nice if people would do their homework and actually lean what the Oil Sands is about and how clean they are.  Guess you still have your work cut out for you Rob!
8694 2018-10-29 04:13:54 Decided to change oil today myself but @NTB tightened the oil drain plug so tight could not get it off.  Took it back but they wouldn’t fix.  Bought last two sets of tires there but won’t go back.

8745 2018-10-29 04:06:05 A quaint idea, useful if you're looking at a demand driven 1950's/60's economy with credit growth that is required to oil the wheels. Not so much today, when expansion of credit is all there is. Now production isn't a barometer of anything, except how much credit you can create.

8825 2018-10-29 03:53:14 This must seem this way to you.  I can respect that you feel that I am hypocritical. Heck you  may be right but I am comfortable carrying two different weights of stones in my 2 hands. One stone, reduce use of oil. Other stone use oil. It's dissonance I can tolerate.

“Air frying” is not a thing. Frying is defined as cooking with oil or another fat. What you are buying is a very small convection oven to bake your food. So let’s call it that: convection baking.
Thank you.
8865 2018-10-29 03:45:52 Unfortunately, it’s a fact, and in Venezuela, those communist freaks have the mental capacity of blaming the oil itself for Venezuela’s crisis, not the fact that Hugo Chavez turned their ecconomy totally dependent on oil, while he crashed private companies.

8879 2018-10-29 03:43:05 I just spent the weekend with my aunt visiting from Missouri. She’s vegetarian and loves turtlenecks, turquoise, and CBD oil. 

Over one last drink at a gay bar,  she wouldn’t tell me whom she voted for in 2016 because “it’s too divisive”

Dear reader—

I wasted my weekend.

8918 2018-10-29 03:36:59 This morning I decided to hot oil treatment my hair, without thinking that my shampoo bar was almost dead. So I tried to wash the oil out of my hair with a bar the size of a quarter that kept breaking. 

End reasult: my hair is still really greasy and smells like tea tree oil.

8951 2018-10-29 03:32:14 #Iran has started selling #oil to local private sectors through #energy stocks market. Presumably, none of the Iranian private companies are capable to get involve to oil #trade with minimum order of 35000 barrels. So who are the trade participants?
8952 2018-10-29 03:32:13 China, Russia, North Korea, a conglomeration of Cartels, probably internally by a domestic faction looking to take control. The shear amount of oil and oil shale is reason enough to take us down.

8972 2018-10-29 03:29:06 I wonder if the networks are treating it like peak oil, and are like, "let's get as much out of this while we still can,"
8973 2018-10-29 03:29:06 Missed on word - GREEDY - want more and more - reduced tax and oil prices w/o realizing we arr saving more money by less inflation/interesr rates being low/no big ticket corruption for which we hv to pay/no terror attacks

8975 2018-10-29 03:28:36 Absolutely vegetable oil are really bad. But these are essentially grilled dishes, so they use the fat within the meat to cook and only brushed with oil. So the oil consumption is very very little and using a tissue to soak it up you can reduce it even further.
8976 2018-10-29 03:28:25 Thanks for the info.. I make my own dark chocolate from 100% Cacao mixing with pure coconut oil, blue berries and black berries.. And eating fresh sources of Vitamin E.

8988 2018-10-29 03:26:58 I was thinking about how Bulletproof extracted MCT from coconut oil to maximize nutrients (and other dietary changes based on principles of science) tho I’m not sure what THEY call if, actually. We need a better word. Now I’m gonna be marinating on it.
8989 2018-10-29 03:26:57 These are made so perfectly. Not a trace of dripping oil. Your best friend is truly in expert in it. I couldn't agree more. By the way is that best friend found in the mirror everytime you look at it?
8990 2018-10-29 03:26:50 Items found in the debris include mobile phones, clothing and parts of the aircraft. Officials believe the aircraft fell into the water after it lost contact, oil slick evident in the search area. An evacuation process is underway #lionair #breakingnews
8991 2018-10-29 03:26:47 Exactly - the hype is driving the politics - yet its such a poorly understood factor. Not to mention, the general public largely fail to differentiate between “smoking marijuana” versus cannabis oil and other forms. Way too much support for something without any solid evidence.

9036 2018-10-29 03:20:43 Mr Desai. India is still fastest growing economy among all major countries. Inflation is still under 5%. High oil and rising $ are global and temporary phenomenon. There is no need to create panic

9038 2018-10-29 03:20:34 Gosh Sena easiest 1 you could’ve given me. At this very moment on the planet earth it is the number one resource for power & many other uses. Yes that is changing & I believe we should embrace those changes. But if we outlawed oil tomorrow we would bankrupt America.

9067 2018-10-29 03:14:40 My way of countering it is by using hormonal essential oil. It’s my lifesaver. I won’t take any painkillers. I find that exercising more before the period comes is effective as well.
9068 2018-10-29 03:14:24 It's always been my experience that if you pour enough oil on something, it will stop being noisy. This was also an effective Medieval defense strategy for fortifications. Plus if you use the right kind of oil, you can just deep fry it and eat it usually.
9069 2018-10-29 03:14:10 We are at 'GLOBAL warming' on the political front— Instead of Carbon emissions from oil, think "hate and fear emissions" that come from using old thinking. And how do you reduce that? Same answer like in our climate crisis— Reduce the "hate and fear emissions" in our mind.

(Tomato paste, cilantro, onion, lots of cumin, culantro, red bell pepper-all finely chopped n mixed). Lightly cook the rice in 2 cubes BEFORE you add the water with salt + pepper+ oil.

9096 2018-10-29 03:10:29 Get some baby oil and deep conditioner and soak the hair and it should slide right off
9097 2018-10-29 03:10:27 Use oil lots of it. And when you attempt to make it again try putting a plastic cap/ shower cap underneath the wig cap then gluing it.

I’m so not use to doing it...
9110 2018-10-29 03:08:47 It delivers tremendously effective hydration for users with dry skin, reducing itching and flakiness as well as moisturizing. The oil is both safe and effective for those with naturally oily skin as well.
9111 2018-10-29 03:08:44 so apparently tea tree oil is a miracle oil? (lol)

idk if I believe the hype tho... but I bought some just to try it out j in case

9131 2018-10-29 03:06:39 Not helping at all? If it’s a hemp oil, your body might just be rejecting it :/ idk why yet but some people have zero help with hemp cbd oil and need cannabis sativa cbd from strains like harle tsu, charlottes web, and Ac/Dc
9132 2018-10-29 03:06:36 Nice to have a political party that actually does stuff for us. The cancer hospital in Calgary was needed. The long term care beds needed. Highway work needed. Maintenance work needed. We have enough oil assets to eventually pay off the debt we have taken on to catch up.

9138 2018-10-29 03:05:28 Oil Spill lasted for like 3 seconds 
9139 2018-10-29 03:05:04 1978 was the record winter in NA. We worked 8 hr tours, 7 on / 3 off. Crew on morning tour (11pm - 8am), I was Derrickman. I had to "double over" (work 16 hrs) 3X that hitch when day tour Derrickman no-showed. 
Made it, but went straight to ER fuktup with acute bronchitis.
9140 2018-10-29 03:04:47 It may work for others but me-no. MS causes balance issues-feeling as if I'm walking leaning to right when in actuality I'm walking perfectly straight. When I tried oil, it intensified that feeling. 
Controlled pain is so much easier to deal with disease.

9146 2018-10-29 03:03:57 Can you please give us an update? Did the oil work? Did you go buy the glue remover?

9159 2018-10-29 03:02:22 First the Earth cooled, and then the dinosaurs came. But they got too big, so they died, and turned into oil. Then the Arabs came and bought Mercedes Benzes.
9160 2018-10-29 03:01:53 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

9164 2018-10-29 03:01:21 If you make cars that kill people you are held accountable. In AB rural Albertans have problems not being addressed by AER. Maybe if the AER did it's job there would be no dissent by folks? We can't shut off the oil industry -not yet at least but it must be accountable to us.

9192 2018-10-29 02:57:18 By this time in his presidency President Obama had ordered Navy Seals on the fantail of the USS Bainbridge to take out three Somali pirates with three shots, won a Nobel Peace Prize, stopped the worst oil leak ever in the Gulf of Mexico, and passed the ACA. Trump has done squat.
9193 2018-10-29 02:56:53 Yes dark spots and acne scars. I tgk youtube liahyoo dia pakai ni and tamanu oil but tamanu oil too expensive around rm90 
9194 2018-10-29 02:56:45 But the foolish bridesmaids said to the wise ones, ‘Give us some of your oil, because our lamps have gone out’...Later the other bridesmaids came and said, ‘Lord, lord, open the door for us.’ “But he replied, ‘I tell you the truth, I don’t know you.’

9196 2018-10-29 02:55:50 The oil and gas ban is a stupid idea and it's great to see it being called out. The doomsday cultists will come after you, but stand your ground.
9197 2018-10-29 02:55:49 Very soon there will be footages of oil spill on the sea on social media or WhatsApp group. Unless it is shared by BASARNAS, it is unconfirmed at very best.
9198 2018-10-29 02:55:42 Yes by Flick! It’s top of the page. Mind you don’t know why they’d want more oil and Nat gas?
9199 2018-10-29 02:55:35 I’m only referring to global oil prices and this being bearish in that regard (I.e. crude price being driven down).
9200 2018-10-29 02:55:22 #bipolardisorder affects everyone so differently.  Meds work for some, but not for others.  Weight loss, weight gain. Mood instability. It's all so confusing.

How do you stabilize your moods?  One dr suggested fish oil, so I'm trying, but don't like the fishy burps.
9201 2018-10-29 02:55:13 FYI, increased gas and heating oil prices that may hit going into winter will hurt Trump's base as well as others. The sane voters will quickly point out how badly Trump "negotiated". Trump will not like the "poutine"

9208 2018-10-29 02:54:22 I do believe it was the Tapcal Trust Fund PCs who did the REDA leg ensuring AER has no duty to the public. So that's odd IMO. How can you be in charge of oil industry problems without a duty to the public? Even if Sask is worse we don't have a good set up in AB. Troubling.

in the context of how they re-invest oil revenues.

Then look at Brazil and ask:
What will a right wing Brazil spend it money on?

My guess: it won't be on education, healthcare or its environment.

9216 2018-10-29 02:53:04 Yep, and he has to have a state income tax passed to pay for his agenda. Pass an oil tax of 10% to put Texans out of work again. He’s a Useful Idiot. Beware!!

9218 2018-10-29 02:52:35 The issue that a nationalist needs to confront is that the same neoliberal economic policies they hate will continue, just with a thin nationalist rhetoric and in Bolsonaro's case extreme reactionary violence. 

But if you like snake oil then fair enough.

9227 2018-10-29 02:50:58 Your knowledge of Iran is quite distorted. Iran is the LARGEST proxy sponsor of terror in the Middle East.

9228 2018-10-29 02:50:34 If a product can actually make you feel better, the people selling it should be able to:
A) Explain how it works in detail
B) Prove that it has been effective in a significant number of people
If you're buying a product that can't do both of these things, you're buying snake oil.
9229 2018-10-29 02:50:31 At least you’ve been making a mint off betting the Oil, right?

9236 2018-10-29 02:49:03 1. Just buy a wig next time lol 
2. Oil sheen or olive oil can help you out tonight ( conditioner like Suave too) 
3. I think Walmart sells glue remover if there is a 24 -hour one around
4. Maybe wrap your hair with a scarf for work tomorrow & make it a style 
9237 2018-10-29 02:48:55 That's a herb, a remedy not a cure for HIV. Those Indians are clever, they know if they use Magaya their product will sell fast. What happened to the anointing oil, Holy water, wrist bands. If it was God's revelation de he receive it as a "prophet" or businessman.
9238 2018-10-29 02:48:51 Would like an assistant for an hour or so each evening. Duties include cleaning and filling my humidifier and oil diffuser. Making sure I have my beverages at my bedside, composing my nighttime tweets, laughing at my jokes because I’m paying you to.

9242 2018-10-29 02:47:58 dawn dish soap straight after, which imo if its good enough for animals in an oil spill its enough for anything, then did a dishwashing cycle on it as well, and fuck it honestly id be willing to do a round of bleach or some specific antibacterial shit if it made them feel better!

9249 2018-10-29 02:46:38 You could just ask. Not a secret. I will ask about but I think it is a test or a safety “pilot light”. Why waste the product you want to sell. Coal mining releases all gas. Oil production often flare all gas

9254 2018-10-29 02:45:53 I have an oil painting of this color pic. I’ll have to post a pic of it. I think I favor my mom a lot. This was 1968.
9255 2018-10-29 02:45:50 I'd take concerns more seriously if people showed equal passion for much larger trading partners such as the Chinese dictatorship with their Muslim reeducation camps and high rate of executions, or all the Saudi oil that flows through their car engines.

9259 2018-10-29 02:44:56 Just spent a weekend in Edmonton. Beautiful city. Definitely not the same Alberta I remember during oil boom days. Seems diversity has taken front seat away from the good Alberta taxpayers.

9261 2018-10-29 02:44:42 If musk was a ceo for an oil company, they would want him in jail for all the lies he's spewed.

9263 2018-10-29 02:44:24 You’re saying Scotland has more levers in UK than France. or Spain in EU??? U must know that all oil&gas is seen as a British export as part of the UK, as is *any* Scottish product that touches an English port. Euro not required, it is a much better store of value than the pound
9264 2018-10-29 02:44:09 Wondering why I take days off...

9271 2018-10-29 02:43:08 Just make sure if it is sweetened and most big brands are, that the sweetener is NOT xylitol. It is highly toxic to dogs. Another advantage of using natural which is just peanuts, oil and salt, or grind your own.

9276 2018-10-29 02:42:54 No its not. Slit is entirely political to save face for the oil leagues. Chinese teams are equivalent to most middle eastern teams. Not saying there aren't quality teams or players out there, but mainly average domestic players with an over reliance on foreign mercenaries

9285 2018-10-29 02:40:48 And that would be bad because? People are literally starving in Venezuela. The Chinese are exploiting the country and Maduro is a dictator. The country has oil and natural resources and yet impoverished.
9286 2018-10-29 02:40:39 Truffle oil is the devil. Specifically "truffle" oil. I just looked up all the gastrointestinal issues it can give you and I had them ALL last night. I know, I know TMI, but this is also a PSA! "Truffle" oil =  Better now though.
9287 2018-10-29 02:40:32 kalo aku sih pake bio oil, coba yang udah pernah pake minyak zaitun sama bio oil lebij efektif mana?

SHOULD I PREPARE THESE KIND OF PRODUCTS AND LAUNCH THEM IN MARKET ?

9297 2018-10-29 02:38:48 So if you’re named Steve Pearce and play for the Red Sox, you’re a talented athlete that’s helping to win the World Series. If you’re named Steve Pearce and from New Mexico, then you love taking money from big oil and taking away heathcare from poor people.
9298 2018-10-29 02:38:41 I bought castor oil to try and induce this labor and never took it lmao I’m scared of diarrhea 1. & 2 I just don’t wanna force my baby out of here.. maybe I want her to come when she ready and I want to have a safe/smooth delivery..

9300 2018-10-29 02:38:22 It all depends on how fast nuclear power plants are built. So far, the speed is not impressive and thus we almost certainly won't reduce fossil fuel use before 2040. 
On the positive side, natural gas is growing faster than coal and oil. 
9301 2018-10-29 02:37:48 Leaving home without cleansing oil or micellar water was the worst mistake. This MASCARA omg. My makeup wipes are struggling.
9302 2018-10-29 02:37:44 Appears Morrison is happy to spend his time on the minutiae of issues than actually govern with any semblance of sensible policy. ACCC has held numerous inquiries fact is prices are linked to Singapore + oil refineries have left Australia #nostockpiling he's #TimeWasting

9310 2018-10-29 02:35:59 Do not feel like being in Walmart all morning for a tire and oil change in the morning
9311 2018-10-29 02:35:59 To be specific, govts are corporate fascists, billionaires & corporations lobby & buy our politicians who create laws to protect their business interests. Whether chemical, oil, environmental, medical, etc. all these industries profits are protected at the expense of the public.

9314 2018-10-29 02:35:46 Who cares when we're scrapping the bottom of the barrel in curbing healthcare costs, ensuring opportunity, education, quality of life, maternal mortality, etc. Not everyone in TX is in the oil and gas biz...but everyone is impacted by areas where we are bringing up the rear.

9320 2018-10-29 02:34:40 We have our guns so OUR defense funds can go to defending YOUR european union while you buy oil from our enemies and make life harder for everyone. There is a reason we don't get invaded despite electiong one idiot after another that wants to stir shit up around the world.
9321 2018-10-29 02:34:16 Ashley I did the same thing except with pure grapefruit essential oil and got instant hives. Take Benadryl and rinse yourself off. I’m not a dr btw
9322 2018-10-29 02:34:14 You ever try to replace money you spend? Like, I just spent $35 on possibly unnecessary jojoba oil but I have these H&M jeans that still have the tag on them... but I’m honestly thinking about bringing them both back and getting back $60.

9329 2018-10-29 02:32:56 Benadryl’s off label use is for headache/migraines. Peppermint oil on the temples, hot bath, cold wash cloth over the eyes, dark room, lots of fluids, some kind of caffeine.
9330 2018-10-29 02:32:53 Like where the FUCK is gas leaking into my oil
9331 2018-10-29 02:32:46 Why the hell is coconut oil people's solution to everything? No Susan, that does not belong in your vagina.
9332 2018-10-29 02:32:36 Then I notice my fucking oil smells like gas so now there's another problem that you have to go looking all over the car to figure out
9333 2018-10-29 02:32:33 Maybe they'll redistribute some of that oil wealth.. 
9334 2018-10-29 02:32:10 I often use peppermint oil on my head to relieve headaches and nausea and I was feeling both today so I went to CVS to buy some but they were out of roll-on so I bought the kind you put in diffusers

And it. Is. So. Much. Stronger.
My. Face. Burns.
9335 2018-10-29 02:32:09 I do think our dependancy on oil is an issue. Especially foreign oil coming from the Middle East.
9336 2018-10-29 02:31:58 In Louisiana, connected to the oil business, I have found huge pockets of Black Trump support. Mostly young men making more than 60,000 a year. Most of them are home owners, most hold old fashioned values like the importance of marriage and church, it's a very interesting group.
9337 2018-10-29 02:31:44 They forget the decades of government building, puppet dictators, and banana republics our government set up and took down in Central and South America. So we could have bananas, coffee, oil, and cocoa.
The US should fix what it broke.
9338 2018-10-29 02:31:36 Uhhhhh ... I'm not sure using state-owned oil industry revenue to fund welfare would be a goer for Aotearoa tbqh.

9363 2018-10-29 02:27:47 I'd say it's more likely that the opportunity hasn't arisen, the way it did for Bush with 9/11 and Obama in Lybia. The man openly questioned why we didnt just take Iraq's oil while campaigning. He's not averse to using the military for his ends.

9366 2018-10-29 02:27:21 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on its board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce American style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news.
9367 2018-10-29 02:27:20 Also, I just had 4 family members call me and ask me for a painting for Christmas cause they really liked my art from summer... so if anyone wants to fund me cause oil painting is a lot of money, let me know

9370 2018-10-29 02:26:58 It is looking like a lot of this was about oil and gas internationally.  Besides being fake foreign policy advisers, George and Carter Page were both involved in international energy business.  Ukraine overthrow was about gas.  Syria about pipeline.

9382 2018-10-29 02:24:37 I'm furious Labour put no safeguards in but whipped MPs too vote for it & just waive it through. That was seriously negligent at best & mendacious at worst, ie crash the economy, claim capitalism has failed & voila Venezuela version no 2 but no vast oil reserves to fall back on.
9383 2018-10-29 02:24:36 Try spraying Fix+ Matte a bit further from your face, Gisel. If you still notice spots, pat gently with a damp Beauty Blender before it dries down. You can also use before makeup to create a matte surface for amazing oil control. Keep us posted!

9398 2018-10-29 02:21:51 Actually there were many geniuses. They all left becuase they were hidebound by Chavez"s nefarious economic policies... That or they became corrupt multimillionaires. 

But U are right. Venezuelan growth was a mirage caused by high oil prices, while the actual economy contracted.
9399 2018-10-29 02:21:18 Did all the jobs in the US just become oil jobs? That is not a well thought out or a well spelled criticism.
9400 2018-10-29 02:21:10 In AB, UCP is screaming about 'bringing AB advantage back.' NDP has managed a very tricky time responsibly. Like them or not, they've been decent stewards. Kenney's thugs blame them for the world price of oil.
9401 2018-10-29 02:21:07 I wish your story wasn't familiar. I wish you didn't know what it's like.

9409 2018-10-29 02:20:00 in Canada the charitable sector employs 2M people and represents 8.1% of Canada’s GDP, larger than the oil and gas or finance industries. The top 1% of organizations bring in the majority of charitable revenue.

9422 2018-10-29 02:18:12 If you don't extract it,you can't use it Eric,thus making our situation as bad as running out of it w/o a replacement.Remember"Peak Oil"=More of the same Anxiety Neurosis you're still stuck on,prolly fear of Death!Or else,what do u want to not extract&when will you stop using it?
9423 2018-10-29 02:18:12 The train mission where you block the tracks with the oil wagon

The ability to manually mark targets
9424 2018-10-29 02:18:08 Not shocking. This administration would bend over backward for big oil as long as it means lining their own pockets.
9425 2018-10-29 02:18:07 By the sound of things... likely still bitter about the Alberta oil sands project supplying the US with oil and cutting into the OPEC profits as the tried to flood the market with cheap oil by not cutting production
9426 2018-10-29 02:18:04 The Marsannay, a Chardonnay from the Côte d’Or région of Burgundy, was perfect with the baked Mac n cheese - and I drizzled some of the Calabrian chili oil over it for a bit extra zip.
9427 2018-10-29 02:17:12 The next time something like that happens I'll tell her to f off on camera.  Don't be a bitch. I was putting oil in a new van.  A van that appears to be a piece of shit.
9428 2018-10-29 02:17:11 Labron supported Hillary and she lost just as Beto will in TX. He wants to flood TX with illegals, raise taxes on oil, legalize pot, and eliminate tax cuts. TX isnt CA or NY. He was meant for CA.

9430 2018-10-29 02:17:06 as a matter of fact, my entire skin care routine got my face selling weird cos my cleanser is apple cider vinegar with water, my toner is chamomille tea with honey and the moisturizer is just sum coconut oil so imagine all that natural ass mess on my face
9431 2018-10-29 02:16:53 Easy heffa. make sure you pay for an oil change on that bandwagon 
9432 2018-10-29 02:16:43 We do not need NEW fracked oil and gas; US is a net exporter this is about lining the pockets of the 1% $$$$$$$$$$$$
9433 2018-10-29 02:16:40 Yeah mine used to knock on the door and he’s said “hey we have an oil change” mind you I wasn’t going to the BR I was sitting in a chair in there but still

9436 2018-10-29 02:16:22 Instead, I think should start a marketing campaign about about a planet filled with their heart’s desires (oil, gold, spices, whatever). We’ll happily fund their trip. Didn’t something like this work last time?
9437 2018-10-29 02:16:11 Outside observer. You both agree TMac and Chia are idiots. And one of you is just a lot more optimistic about how good the talent depth is. You're both Oil fans dammit. We gotta stick together in these less then before tough times!
9438 2018-10-29 02:16:08 Scummo will just shout so loud, the oil companies will drop the price just to shut him up.

9440 2018-10-29 02:16:00 Because the United States has destroyed their countries. 
Destroyed or propped up military governments or stripped them of oil or something else of value. Honduras

Guatemala
Syria 
Yemen 
Iraq
And so many more.
9441 2018-10-29 02:15:51 In prison, dinner was always a big thing. We had a pasta course and then we had a meat or fish. Paulie did the prep work. He had this wonderful system of cutting garlic. He used a razor and would slice it so thin that it would liquefy in the pan with some oil. Very good system.
9442 2018-10-29 02:15:44 There are only 3 ways for a government to pay for anything: taxes, user fees or debt. There is no 4th way other than nationalized wealth like oil.

9448 2018-10-29 02:15:16 I’d love to ban fracking altogether. As is, the oil and gas industry has spent a ton of money trying to defeat the mostly toothless 112.
9449 2018-10-29 02:15:08 Saw a tweet suggesting that making #hydrogen (clean fuel) from #fossilfuels (#Coal, #oil and nat. gas #CSG) was in someway good for the #environment :/ #Fossilfuels are composed mainly of carbon (C) and #hydrogen (H). So, if you make H there's a good chance C will be left behind.
9450 2018-10-29 02:14:56 I’m so sick of war! Children are being killed! Civilians don’t have a chance, they are being slaughtered, their homes destroyed! Our kids are being killed, maimed and forgotten when they come home! All for oil...all for someone to get rich! It’s time to stop!!

Yes, they fried them in oil, I guess.

9489 2018-10-29 02:08:30 Cara, I am sorry to hear about your anxiety. It sounds terrible. I am wondering if you have tried #CBD oil. It is natural and many reports said it works for anxiety and many other conditions. #
9490 2018-10-29 02:08:12 Crude oil is broken down by bacteria in the oceans. In warmer waters the biodegradation rate is higher. If after 14 years there isn't a critical issue with this damaged well, there never will be one.
9491 2018-10-29 02:08:06 Oh BTW, I noticed your meme. It failed to mention that you referred to Alberta as...in your words as "An embarrassing cousin that no one wants to talk about". Or even better yet...You referred  Albertans as "sewer rats". I'm guessing that you meant towards the oil patch workers.

9505 2018-10-29 02:06:26 We may be the largest crude oil producer but the numbers aren't out yet. However, we should be focusing on cleaner, renewable energy sources.
9506 2018-10-29 02:06:26 Russia and Texas are two of the largest producers of oil and gas in the world, and, because many companies involved in the petroleum industry in Texas have dealings with Russian entities or individuals, they are likely to be faced with sanctions issues.
9507 2018-10-29 02:06:22 I usually just cut it in half, scoop out the seeds, rub with olive oil & whatever spices you feel like, throw on chopped garlic, & roast for 45m-1hr @ 200ish C, then put in a pot with some water & maybe cream & olive oil, cook a bit, blender on a stick it, season to taste.

9512 2018-10-29 02:05:45 yeah it's still early but not 3 games into the season early.  I actually think the Oil will do better in November since they have a way softer schedule. My whole point was it was way to early to make fun of the Oilers like @mirtle did after they played three road games...

Tariffs and trade barriers to increase cost of goods, peak shale oil, slowing of int’l capital flows financing US deficits. Interest rates to go much higher, equities to tank, and weak usd/gold rip.

9526 2018-10-29 02:03:45 This is ALL about oil. The oil barons are driving fascism. With one hit, save the world, make it humane and fit to live on - stop using petroleum products, get renewable energy going on your own small scale. Get rid of what makes these people powerful.
9527 2018-10-29 02:03:45 Actually,  there's one born every minute. The type that gets taken in by conmen, snake oil salesmen and hucksters. DT is taking credit for an economy Obama resurrected, and he wants them to believe the tax bill benefits them. They are the 2018 version of Trump U grads.

9542 2018-10-29 02:01:23 Problem is FB,TW,Apple,AMZ,Google are monopolies. They literally control what you see, hear, read on the internet. They have far more power than ATT or Standard Oil had before being broken up. Either be neutral &only calls to violence get you banned or be regulated like a utility

MEX sends us a trickle of oil.  US is now largest exporter of oil.  HOW do you feel about that Refinery?

Cut that to $9.5T, put it towards Healthcare. Keep oil in chk at the same time to halt inflation

It's the inside matter Petroleum produced at Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and is an index of Asian oil price. Petroleum is natural resources, so the price is different depending on its quality. gas and kerosene are the light oil included much

9610 2018-10-29 01:47:52 We like it. We have so much, I grinded a bunch and keep ot by the stove to use when cooking. We used to only use it on tomatoes with a little olive oil and balsamic.

Every administration since Nixon (tho not Trump) has promised to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil (energy), but are giving up the farm on this new and rapidly growing industry, so the US will remain dependent on foreign energy.

9667 2018-10-29 01:38:58 That was not what was said in the video. Obama said this how you can take a small responsibility in the energy concerns. Keep your vehicle maintained, and you will not be as dependent on oil. Now it may only save ya $100 a year, but 100 is a 100 in your pocket.

9680 2018-10-29 01:36:18 In the last Canadian federal election, the Conservatives ran a strident anti-muslim election campaign. Ford was elected premiere of Ontario. Trudeau bought out a devastating oil pipeline project and is attempting to ram it through indigenous opposition. Canada is not unaffected.

9685 2018-10-29 01:34:35 I don't need too..  It's a simple statement of fact.. There are oil execs that only make into the 5 or 6 figures .. There are some Enviro's that make 6 to 7 figures.. It all depends on who you pick as the Exec and who you pick as the Enviro

9687 2018-10-29 01:34:17 Ah. Have you tried an all natural pre-shave oil? That can help. And a post-shave toner, like witch hazel, may help prevent your pores from clogging up and getting infected after a shave.

9707 2018-10-29 01:31:45 We (Brazil) are not interested in their oil. Bolsonaro for sure has an interest in saving that country from communism and misery. They are broken and invading Brazil to survive!

9771 2018-10-29 01:21:05 Don't know. This thread is about the carbon plan, so I figured that's why you put the charts in here. Is there another thread about abolishing oil and increasing taxes on job providers that you can point me to?
9772 2018-10-29 01:21:01 I need to invest in some anti frizz oil , moisturizer or something .

9781 2018-10-29 01:19:39 Step 4: Google "is it ok to cook with slimy mushrooms?"
Step 5: immediately start forking the mushrooms out of the sautee mixture. I cannot stress how important this step is to confuse your taste buds later.
Step 6: use like...a whole jar of pesto? And olive oil?
9782 2018-10-29 01:19:18 That would be a 3rd of a 3rd wave then. But, right now, oil, US futures & Asia so far show inclination of looking at that rally potential.

9791 2018-10-29 01:18:19 I'm not Canadian, just noticing Macro trends that seem to be holding in the current government. Which party is for abolishing oil and increased taxes on job providers?
9792 2018-10-29 01:18:17 I’d like to hear more about cutting oil and gas subsidies
9793 2018-10-29 01:18:15 The prices of everything haven’t increased. The province was hit w a recession and tanking oil prices that had nothing to do with the party in power. Please don’t generalize.Premier Notley has tackled not only the Ft Mac fire but other issues like WCB for farm workers.She cares.
9794 2018-10-29 01:18:05 The reason Venezuela is going thru this is not socialism but their corrupt politicians and their dependency on oil prices,that was their fall

9829 2018-10-29 01:12:49 RJ, checking tires for proper inflation is one way to conserve energy and reduce demand for petroleum. It's an example. Not the answer to everything.

Doesn't conservation make the most sense? It's much less costly to reduce demand than to chase oil that's hard to extract.

9907 2018-10-29 00:59:14 Thanks, Lol i didnt look it up. Itd be easier for customers to see the # of capsules not dried flower value.  Their current medical inventory is pretty low- thc oil, 3 types of flower and 3 milled blends. No capsules.
9908 2018-10-29 00:58:53 You can make a half-decent cheesesteak with it. Use a little extra olive oil and a little soy + worchestershire sauce to bring it closer to par. Extra onion helps, too. Obviously it's not fresh ribeye but it does what it needs to do. A utilitarian cheesesteak solution.

9923 2018-10-29 00:57:18 @cristo_burton The Saudi Oil embargo back in '73 changed the balance of power between East and West. It also meant the banks stopped lending , and it was the banks who enforced austerity on NY, bec tax payers left NY. The banks control politicians , and the world economy.

9927 2018-10-29 00:56:23 Hi. 
$QIWI’s price rose since Oct 10.
But stocks and oil markets are weak lately. It seems risk-off. I think $QIWI has the same situation, so I’ll wait and see.
On the other hand, gold price is rising, so I bought $AU $GFI $HMY.
Is my English correct ? Thank you !
9928 2018-10-29 00:56:23 By this logic the US was not neutral in 1937 when it cut oil exports to Japan. As long as there's no military embargo or declaration of war they are not at war.

9935 2018-10-29 00:54:52 @cristo_burton Bec the situation between Israel and Palestine is the root of the problem. The Saudi Oil embargo back in '73 was in revenge for America's support of Israel during the Yom Kippur war. The damage the embargo did to the Western economy has repercussions today.

9975 2018-10-29 00:48:31 If you don’t put body oil in your baths... grow up. 

Jk but realtalk this takes baths to the next level relaxing. Makes the water smell bomb & moisturizes your skin at the same time 

P.S. I am definitely drinking a beer in the bathtub right now.
9976 2018-10-29 00:48:30 Bolsonaro really favors the Agriculture community. Those wealthy donors surely want to exploit more of the Amazon along with oil companies.

Say hello to further acceleration of climate change as another ignorant leader will cow tow to big business.

9983 2018-10-29 00:45:52 2/2 that being said, what we’re seeing in Brazil is US propping up a right winger to counter Maduro in Venezuela. Between Colombia and Brazil, US now has 2 allies to go squeeze Maduro. Lots of oil/minerals at stake.

9988 2018-10-29 00:45:21 I always thought Howard did 2 good things. Gun laws and going into defend E Timor. Now I can’t help think he only would go into E Timor to screw them on gas and oil. It’s hard not to be cynical with that nasty bastard.

Like we fought a war in the middle east for oil, we continue to pollute our own air and public spaces killing ourselves just because it might save a greedy business

10000 2018-10-29 00:43:41 This oil rig mission about 16% through the game is giving me a hard ass time
10001 2018-10-29 00:43:27 Unfortunately the loudest and most obnoxious do not and they buy ink by the barrel.
10002 2018-10-29 00:43:26 “Oil field never sleeps, sweetie.”
10003 2018-10-29 00:43:08 42-21-7 if you don't count the games against the Oil. Makes it even more impressive
10004 2018-10-29 00:43:07 Jstclair:"How many villages in Central America has this US barged into,  taken what  it’s corporations wanted–oil, fruit, copper–and left behind  nothing but  toxic waste pits and graves full of peasants?"
10005 2018-10-29 00:42:20 But,.. but the stadiums! Copa! The new oil, the old trees! The endless eudæmonia machine!
10006 2018-10-29 00:42:08 Not disagreeing that our d the team is shaky and we fell apart when Crow went out.  Of course, McJeesus is crazy good and the Oil leads the pac.

10019 2018-10-29 00:40:53 American arms and middle eastern oil secured ‘Israeli’ borders. Just because they walked into Palestine/Lebanese etc. provinces & stole them at the point of a gun, doesn’t make their oppression right. Israel has proved more murderous than the Nazis. Needs to be said. Sue me.
