41 2018-10-27 23:55:34 Lavender oil.  Massage it into your temples and the base of your skull.  Also, roll a towel and place it under your neck as you lay down.  Try to relax as you lay down like that for a bit.

43 2018-10-27 23:55:05 Bruce just hoped he made it through the night without spilling red wine on his white dress shirt.  Or marinara sauce; either would have been as big a catastrophe as dunking his tie in olive oil.

Maybe he needed to wear a bib.

Get yourself together, Bruce, he told himself as he~

84 2018-10-27 23:46:33 Facts don't lie and neither does evidence lie.  The system that insists on getting resources under the control of some entities via force is the system that has perpetuated wars, invasions, colonialism, theft, killing for gains... etc. Wars for oil...

92 2018-10-27 23:44:05 We need to care for our parks. But this legislation is actually just opening OUR parks up to exploitation from the oil & gas industry so a few rich folks can profit. It's possible to care for our National Parks without selling em to the highest bidder.
93 2018-10-27 23:44:02 I feel for you so much. This was not your fault.

I never knew how many foods contain xylitol. It's in loads.

128 2018-10-27 23:38:31 With this I would recommend you 1st start to religiously exfoliate with either a good diy scrub(sugar+olive oil) or one from the shop. Once or twice a week. It does work. Then you can follow up with other things.

151 2018-10-27 23:34:17 I disagree - no country has to do business with Saudi - just like they don’t have to do business with Iran.  US is now the worlds biggest energy producer.  Saudi is trying to diversify its economy because it realizes oil is a declining commodity.
152 2018-10-27 23:34:06 Oil much need it
153 2018-10-27 23:33:32 finally got an oil change for my poor car

156 2018-10-27 23:33:23 It’s easier to make contracts in quantities of liquid like frozen orange juice or hemp oil than ‘solids’ like wheat or barley... but we can handle it if we consider ‘solids’ like liquids: bushel.

161 2018-10-27 23:32:48 But it wasn't kitchen fires that caused global warming. It was industry. Can the rest of the world fuel the rise to wealthiness without cheap oil and coal?
162 2018-10-27 23:32:30 Only in the US. In Europe it’s only salt, oil and potato and they taste different.
163 2018-10-27 23:32:30 Gamblin oil colors stole my room and instantly hear Homestuck shipping talk from being more into theory to being interested in data.
164 2018-10-27 23:32:01 So I’m not feeling well, and usually what helps is oil of oregano.  If you have ever taken this, you know why I’m dreading it.

169 2018-10-27 23:30:39 Do remember where the term snake oil comes from.
170 2018-10-27 23:30:29 I'd argue that information shortage is actually quite common, indeed that's the very purpose of communication.

Instead I think data is unlike oil because it's non rival - reading this doesn't prevent others from doing so too. You can't make a copy of a barrel of oil.

183 2018-10-27 23:28:28 Agreed. Admit I was very critical and down on them after Nash game last week. Thought it would be like last year. Last three games have shown me they are hopefully more like ‘16/17 team. Keep it up Oil!!
184 2018-10-27 23:28:14 Sana oil could understand my point and the way i think. Not all the time u should be selfless, being selfish is good too.
185 2018-10-27 23:28:13 of course it will be a different planet...we'll have no clear air or water and all our natural areas will have oil wells and fracking mines

193 2018-10-27 23:27:12 I think the better statement would be, “I know how I am going to win, therefore I am not going to lose.”  In the energy-oil-gas industry, if you don’t take this approach, you will lose every time!
194 2018-10-27 23:26:58 As for Iran. Shah wanted more money for each oil barrel and US/UK didnt like that. It’s a history how these mullahs came to power, not a mistery, dig up on it a bit and Shah was not a radical religious figure so if had remained, just imagine2+2=4 so dont tell me US didnt Fup
195 2018-10-27 23:26:36 I noticed the Q in your profile. Be careful with those conspiracy theories. Trump is a snake oil salesmen. Take care.
196 2018-10-27 23:26:23 I’d like to try Keto to see if I’ll feel as good as they say I will.  I know I won’t be able to do it long term bc I can’t live off meat and olive oil, but worth a try I think.
197 2018-10-27 23:26:11 And also definitely needs some gauges for temp and oil pressures.  I learned the hard way with the renesis.

201 2018-10-27 23:25:14 1.2% of all our exports (0.12% of which are arms) are to Saudi Arabia. Add to that some of our brightest and best are making weapons instead of building a low carbon future to reduce our dependency on oil.

203 2018-10-27 23:24:59 To prevent your pasta from sticking, add a little olive oil to the water before it boils.
204 2018-10-27 23:24:54 It’s OK we can give everyone pay rises with our oil wealth fund
205 2018-10-27 23:24:50 Coffee filter in a pinch, but I keep some cheesecloth in a ziploc bag that I reuse. I replace it I think every three bottles of oil or so, when I can’t rinse it anymore

211 2018-10-27 23:24:09 Im getting my oil changed and i asked ol dude how many miles can i go in between oil changes he was like about 5,000.

213 2018-10-27 23:23:38 Internally speaking for the rx8’s engine. The renesis is not as great as the later model 13B y’all should add a sohn oil adapter for premixing and also allows u to use synthetic oils ; ls2 ignition coil upgrade.

216 2018-10-27 23:22:55 This government is so bad for the environment and public health. Being taken to court for poor air quality, fracking, expansion of airports, stopping subs for elec cars, solar panels and anything kind for the environment. Why? Being paid 000's in 'donations' by oil companies!
217 2018-10-27 23:22:54 Sec. Mattis - Saudi Issue.

If Saudi's have paid for US arms, I would remove all non-residential US people.

Then using US power, conferred post-WW2, I would ban Saudi Arabia from oil sales income for 1 year.

Hurt them in pocket.

No income, if behave, done, if not, 2nd year ban
218 2018-10-27 23:22:36 I prefer balm over oil, not as greasy.
219 2018-10-27 23:22:13 Yes, because cleaner air and water are all ploys to make money...

It can't be billion dollar oil companies desperately defending their fortune with the one party that loves rewarding billion dollar companies....

290 2018-10-27 23:11:29 Yep, that's among the reasons why the Pei Plan for OKC wasn't followed through to completion - the oil bust and the S&L crisis wiped out anyone here who could invest, but they just kept tearing down the historic buildings anyway. Only one new tower - Leadership Square - (1/3)

296 2018-10-27 23:10:54 Was Jesus Christ cooked in olive oil?
297 2018-10-27 23:10:49 This is misinformation.

The Trump admin has already targeted eastern SLO County for expanded extraction.

And who would stop them from Fracking if this measure fails? Not our County Supervisors, majority controlled by COLAB (big oil $$$).

This is big oil vs grass roots.

307 2018-10-27 23:09:25 Heavy industrial (oil, energy, processing, etc) take note. This is how you create innovation and collaboration in a specific vertical.

The province of quebec emit 82.7 megatonnes per year of ghg. Maybe we should be shutting down the mega French based lafarge cement plant in quebec, which is heavily subsidized by the Canadian taxpayers.Go figure.

2008-2012: With the constitutional amendment and his death.

They apply to individuals. In fact, Venezuelan companies just imported wheat from the US.

432 2018-10-27 22:43:36 If you think that a calorie of coconut oil and a calorie of bread contain the same calories then I suppose a kilo of organic grass fed beef weighs the same as a kilo of pasta? Well they don’t! What are you some kind of idiot? #Pioppi

444 2018-10-27 22:41:29 Not one in particular, I just substitute it for oil. I vaguely remember making a mayonnaise with it once. You could definitely make an aioli with it.
445 2018-10-27 22:41:27 Guess who just found out that some of the chicken for tonight's dinner was slightly frozen. And guess how I found out? Yup, by putting it in a pan of oil! My kitchen is now covered in olive oil.

464 2018-10-27 22:36:46 It's a tragedy that Big Oil is willing to destroy the environment & poison the planet just to keep a hold on their dollars. There has been so much advancement in renewable energy that is it a hugely booming economy. The science is irrefutable that there is a global climate shift.

469 2018-10-27 22:35:21 Let's pass amendment 112 and move all oil production (pads and storage) away from our homes.  Let the oil companies do horizontal drilling if they want to get to the resources that are under communities.
470 2018-10-27 22:34:35 How about the U.S. Military Industrial Complex making trillions of dollars selling WMDs to Saudi Arabia to be used against Yemenis civilians. In Yemen millions are starving to death because Saudi Arabia is running out of oil and wants to steal theirs.

476 2018-10-27 22:33:53 Worth noting: Conservatives have their own version of political correctness that silences free speech on the ethics & legality of wars, occupations, murders & state-backed industrial espionage on behalf of the oil & gas industry? #insiders #TimorLeste #ChilcotInquiry #auspol

These people are morally depraved beyond all human recognition — so much so that they may as well be a different species — but we are addicted to their oil, so they act with impunity.

503 2018-10-27 22:27:21 Mine is the same way. We have a safe spot for her. CBD oil helps quite a bit. I only give her a little bit but it makes a difference. 
504 2018-10-27 22:27:05 Seed oils = disproportionate omega-6, more easily oxidizable. If not UNhealthy, certainly not AS healthy as nut oils, olive oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, right? Why "meh"?
505 2018-10-27 22:27:04 Could be time to talk to your doctor or it could be that you haven't identified your "it". 
I've dealt with insomnia for the last 8+ years. I don't like the side effects of most drugs so I avoid them. I have been using CBD oil off and on for 6 months and it really works for me.

521 2018-10-27 22:24:07 Let them soak in water for a few hours. Drain and put in plastic bag. Pour in vegetable oil and seasoning to taste (I use salt, pepper and a pinch of cayenne).  Shake bag until seeds coated. Pour on sheet pan. Roast at 400 for about 20 minutes or until done.

531 2018-10-27 22:21:36 @evolabevolved every time I get a new syringe for your pens you’ve changed the design. This time your syringe didn’t have the .5 mg of oil at all. Since the cartridges are .25 and it didn’t fill two... I feel like that’s obvious

539 2018-10-27 22:20:46 Great news— and we also need to work to expand this to communities reliant on coal, oil, and gas businesses to assist them in handling the inevitable clean energy transition
540 2018-10-27 22:20:36 Drink 8oz V8, an oz olive oil and 3 coffees works like a charm
541 2018-10-27 22:20:22 I do think it's unreasonable that all my citizens run away in a sulk if they run out of olive oil for 5 mins. Get a grip. 'Ooh, mother, there's no asparagus in Waitrose, let's all bugger off and live in the woods'
542 2018-10-27 22:20:16 My remix was something I did in the 90s atmosphere. I missed an opportunity. I should have thought of 2300 and robots with depression having sex with a can of oil to lubricate their crevices. I'm a loser.

581 2018-10-27 22:14:18 Corruption in the United States is terrible and they are willing to do anything for their own sake. They do not like the exemption because they lose billions of dollars in oil money. Do not believe what you see, there is another game behind the scenes

589 2018-10-27 22:12:46 Wait what? When did I ever call "every single party Dem a neolib oil soaked whore"? I am absolutely confused. Are you making this up, or are you speaking to somebody else?
590 2018-10-27 22:12:25 Im tryna get an oil changed and the guy walks up like “how can I help you? I’m like “I’m tryna get an oil change”... this nigga steps back and says “yea it looks like you’re having fender issues”.... so I repeat myself “yea I’m tryna get an oil change.”

599 2018-10-27 22:11:17 However, if another company comes up with a way to use XRP, they can. It's still the same thing. If Exxon had found the only place on the planet that has oil and they laid claim to that site, drilled and accessed that oil to sell, it's still an asset and not a security.
600 2018-10-27 22:11:12 Hahaha shame on you, where in your so called SS are you from let me lecture you about what your people are going through right now, if you are bold enough call your community and I will tell you everything you need to know, Oil that has brought untold tears to you

604 2018-10-27 22:10:35 I tend to think everybody is innocent until proven guilty. Yes, even if his musical taste isn't really so refined as that of a neanderthal. About the oil, I'm not sure. How much would it be?

616 2018-10-27 22:08:43 Certainly not any of us especially the bloggers, give credit so far to the team. Today the Oil were prepared to play!

623 2018-10-27 22:07:20 Seems to be one who thinks fracking and avoiding any sort of carbon tax is the way forward for our province's economy. "Big Oil will surely save us"
624 2018-10-27 22:07:17 Flexing ones muscles to a bunch of poor, homeless, powerless people looking for a better life, isn’t a show of power.

But kissing the Saudi ring because they’re buying arms and selling oil, sure is a show of weakness.

637 2018-10-27 22:05:54 No, it was a sarcastic comment. Also, I don't think Gold and Oil really works the same way because people buy them for different reasons.
638 2018-10-27 22:05:41 He may probably become bigger than crude oil with the way he is going. After STEW, wonder what next

649 2018-10-27 22:03:34 Have you ever had chili oil? A spoon full will certainly wake you up...! Or knock you down.
650 2018-10-27 22:03:33 Italian olive oil is the best no doubt.
651 2018-10-27 22:03:32 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
652 2018-10-27 22:03:28 I only have regular castor oil but I guess Jamaican castor oil is best :) apply some on the brows, get a lil spoolie and comb them in the direction they should go. The rest comb your eyelashes with
653 2018-10-27 22:03:17 Here’s a random question. What kind of filter/strainer do you use for cleaning the oil as you pour it back in the bottle? We try to do the reuse thing but it’s hard to get it clean enough.
654 2018-10-27 22:03:16 Hahah wow the pacific is bad this year, similar to how it was in 16-17 when the oil made the playoffs

657 2018-10-27 22:02:36 peppermint and castor oil combo is the best 
658 2018-10-27 22:02:34 Also. How do I get my skin to recover from the hospital? It’s so dry and I’ve basically bathed in coconut oil and lotion.
659 2018-10-27 22:02:33 PMB initial sluggishness, the CBN's damaging foreign exchange controls, & a decimated oil sector contributed to the nation's abysmal economic performance in last two years. In turn, the average Nigerian is worse off than in pre-Buhari times, an observation that is hard to deny.
660 2018-10-27 22:02:19 Green tech needs to be paid for. Look at how far ahead Norway is. Why? Cos it sold oil to pay for it.

668 2018-10-27 22:00:29 How about you stop buying their oil? No? I thought not.

678 2018-10-27 21:59:44 Lol you think ksa isnt gonna collapse? Other than the fact that they’re oppressing the people they only depend on oil for income and this will soon stop. And same to iran. The other 3 are still thriving cuz they have control over the leaders of weaker countries (ME, AFRICA, ETC)
679 2018-10-27 21:59:41 A good cooking tip    if you add coconut oil to kale...it makes it easier to scrape into the bin
680 2018-10-27 21:59:38 They waited til after I was done with all the paperwork and leaving to be like “oh yeah it may not be ready til Tuesday” all they gotta do is clean it and give it an oil change. Come on y’all I will take it how it is if it’ll take that long
681 2018-10-27 21:59:34 Donna, they could also get that $450 million back that Turnbull gave to his miner & big oil mates on the so-called Great Barrier Reef Foundation.

685 2018-10-27 21:59:13 That is your mind , as for me all are the same. From coconut you have coconut shift, oil etc. Most of them are from PDP.
686 2018-10-27 21:59:10 Way to go Oil!  Didn’t see the whole game, but closing out with the lead may have been better. I trust it eventually will be!
687 2018-10-27 21:59:04 Continuing my kitchen faucet saga, I just want to say how much I detest the person who installed my mom’s faucet 15 years ago, whoever you are. I got the tool in a timely manner, but despite my best efforts, even with penetrating oil, was unable to budge the nut to uninstall
688 2018-10-27 21:58:22 We are not the worlds 5th richest country that is a Tory myth, fact is we are 28th with most of the oil producers in the middle East and Oman are in front of us.

699 2018-10-27 21:54:36 The Cold War would have ended in due course. The Soviet Union was depleted internally by the early 1970s. Our wheat help plus oil and gold price surge gave them an extended life. Escalating the war was the worst thing to do. No credit for Carter or Reagan.

709 2018-10-27 21:52:48 They also got outscored by Nashville’s powerplay. 1-7 for oil 2-7 for Nashville. I think sometimes you’re too busy admiring your own tweets to pay attention to the actual game lol.
710 2018-10-27 21:52:40 I just had to take CBD oil to help stop the burning sensation and the pain
711 2018-10-27 21:52:14 Don't let america knows that oil
712 2018-10-27 21:51:58 But there are people across the spectrum turning up the heat and pouring on the oil. While others are warming butter.

718 2018-10-27 21:50:32 As someone who lives in China and studies the Communist Party, please trust me when I say that foreigners petitioning the Chinese government to stop anything they do is about as useful as climbing up a wall in the rain with oil on your hands and feet

It will never, ever work.
719 2018-10-27 21:50:23 You ever looked into krill oil?
720 2018-10-27 21:50:22 Data is not like oil - there is absolutely nothing that I can think about that makes it similar to oil - it’s a low IQ soundbite that is infecting solid thinking - alternatively I can point to ten things that are differences between data and oil #My31

725 2018-10-27 21:48:48 What is OEM oil? Shell Helix meets and even exceeds the spec, and wherever I've used it, the dregs in the can have provided top-ups between changes.
726 2018-10-27 21:48:44 I'm anti-fracking anyway because we should be attempting to extract more oil apart from the risks. We just need to make sure we look at the data right or any arguments get quickly knocked down.
727 2018-10-27 21:48:32 True. I’ve realized it’s kind of silly to buy butter or coconut oil. So much fat available from other sources.

736 2018-10-27 21:47:28 Anyone involved in the Nigerian oil industry in a board function is by definition corrupt... ! Period!

745 2018-10-27 21:45:13 #Cruz Ted gets More bribe money (contributions) from Big Oil companies than any other senator.
A #Texas vote for Ted is a vote for water & Gulf pollution. Also a vote for worse hurricanes each year since he'll oppose any #Climatechange solutions. #TexasDebate #youthvote #NextGen
746 2018-10-27 21:45:12 Lenny’s subs I’m craving the deluxe all the way no oil and vinegar .
747 2018-10-27 21:45:09 From an economic perspective, the only Nigerian export that is bigger than WizKid right now,  is crude oil
748 2018-10-27 21:45:06 I have an idea. We could take advantage of high oil prices get $billions to pay for climate change mitigation and adaptation. That will work, won't it.
749 2018-10-27 21:45:03 This is absurd.. next they’ll tell you where to buy your groceries and gas .. “No more BP , too many oil spills Visa now supports only Sunoco” 
750 2018-10-27 21:44:58  its not deep fa
751 2018-10-27 21:44:48 Time to get out the pot of boiling oil and the pulley.
752 2018-10-27 21:44:30 And Al-Quaida and Al-Nusra enter the game and a part of the opposition splited.Israel was buying oil in Turquie from the Islamic State who never attaqued Israel and was helping Al Nusra(Al Qaida in Siria)with wounded soldiers and provided them with medical assistance in Israel...
753 2018-10-27 21:44:27 Wow so impressed with this magic plant,  it gives so many amazing results 
Where can I get some oil for my face? PM me PLEASE   
754 2018-10-27 21:44:14 With crazy schedule to start the season who would have thought 5-3-1 after 9 games for the Oil. Major props to Drai the birthday boy with 2G, Cag with 2G, 7 second later go ahead by McD, Russell for shot blocks, Lucic for hits and Kosk for first start @EdmontonOilers @Sportsnet
755 2018-10-27 21:44:04 @EdmontonOilers couple good wins against two top clubs. Way to go OIL. Today's game against Nashville a little scary with all those penalties. Good to see Larsson come back in the 3rd.
756 2018-10-27 21:43:57 Business spending/CAPEX did not contract, the growth of business fixed investment reduced to 0.8% growth, 1.9% excl. volatile oil/gas. Prior 2 quarters saw strong growth in business spending/CAPEX
757 2018-10-27 21:43:46 Time to implement lowering into pot of boiling oil.
758 2018-10-27 21:43:35 i always use aloe vera gel as a moisturizer but i’ve had really bad dry patches and found that vitamin e oil has helped a lot! and it hasn’t made me break out either

766 2018-10-27 21:42:30 There are also chances The the landed oil is sometimes Iranian oil mixed in with other types.
767 2018-10-27 21:42:27 ain't nothin slick to a quart of oil.
768 2018-10-27 21:42:22 I can relate
769 2018-10-27 21:42:15 Trudeau has turned Caron tax into the issue. What about economy, illegal migrants, oil and gas.... it shows exactly how out of touch he is. @AndrewScheer should focus on economy, jobs, healthcare, border security as priority issues which affects average Canadians.
770 2018-10-27 21:41:35 put tea tree oil on it!

774 2018-10-27 21:41:17 It’s clear that the SNP are only energised when anti - Brit grievances are aired.  

When it’s pro - Scotland, such as the NHS, Education, the economy OR famously, helping the oil industry, the sitting on hands and blaming the English is the order of the day.
775 2018-10-27 21:41:15 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
776 2018-10-27 21:41:14 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
777 2018-10-27 21:41:14 Just wondering how many of the people who voted for @CaseyPeterJ might have got the oil stolen from their oil tanks or the tools stolen from their vans or garden sheds by a group of people who pay no tax, usc, prsi get benefits and drive €50k 4x4s #Aras2018
778 2018-10-27 21:40:51 nice W for the oil there, looking more like the team from 2 years ago now

785 2018-10-27 21:40:03 I really thought the turnout among 12-14 year old boys with baby oil hidden in their sock drawers would have been higher...
786 2018-10-27 21:39:48 i was depressed and after eating muji's olive oil popcorn, i'm even more depressed
787 2018-10-27 21:39:16 Yep same damaged ppl that blame "the Jews" on Wall Street, corporations, oil companies, turmoil in the Middle East/the rest of the world & insist Israel shld be turned over to 'the Palestinians'. And when they're not calling us Nazis they claim Hitler didn't kill tht many Jews.
788 2018-10-27 21:39:00 I wonder what headgear Peter Laviolette will wear after this game’s presser after losing to the lowly Oil
789 2018-10-27 21:38:47 Saladi instead of cooking oil
790 2018-10-27 21:38:45 The oil cartel is chopping up journalists in embassies but the FBI comes running when @elonmusk sends a tweet.

793 2018-10-27 21:37:59 Great! Add oil
794 2018-10-27 21:37:52 2 cycle engines mix oil and gas together. The engines are lighter that 4 stroke engines like a car, but pollute more.
795 2018-10-27 21:37:41 Peppermint oil on the temple or back of the neck with an ice pack on top.
796 2018-10-27 21:37:27 Niggas crack their oil pan one time and immediately cut off half of their rear bumper and lift their car to go track style 
797 2018-10-27 21:37:22 Need to soak in a hot tub for 40 mins.... And laid on a table and rubbed with eucalyptus oil.... Then have some hot chocolate while watching ur favourite movie and ve ur feet rubbed.. It ll all be gone... Trust me..

803 2018-10-27 21:36:31 The only self-made recession I see is the one where Alberta, aided by the HarperCons, went all in on the #tarsands without thinking about what would happen if oil prices tanked. Oops. Despite Notley becoming an oiltard, #AB seems to creeping back with a more diversified economy.
804 2018-10-27 21:36:08 Yet you side with party who want base economy on oil... Tad hypocrisy there Ross
805 2018-10-27 21:35:31 I noticed that virtually  all major infrastructural development we've been carrying out are done on some loan of some sort or the other. What exactly is the government doing with revenue from oil and other 'diversification' avenues?
806 2018-10-27 21:35:20 i just accidentally stuck my paintbrush in my mouth w white oil paint on it
807 2018-10-27 21:35:18 I need my oil changed! Let him know lol
808 2018-10-27 21:35:11 Oil paints are thick and messy and expensive and take forever to dry.  Why couldn’t the Fauvists have just used acrylics...
809 2018-10-27 21:35:06 Peppermint essential oil!
810 2018-10-27 21:34:29 I voted for increased responsibility on environmental damage.

If they cause it, they need to fix it. It's that simple. Too often, oil companies humblebrag about clean-up efforts, as if such things are above and beyond. You get no kudos for partially fixing something you caused.
811 2018-10-27 21:34:14 once again congratulations to @amy_vanderveer for being selected to Homecoming Royalty! We are so proud to have had you represent OUr delegation! 
812 2018-10-27 21:33:59 Mid 700s, but there’s a shit ton of deals on brand new cars you can get them to almost 10k below msrp but new cars come with warranty which old cars do not have, that in itself saves you thousands. Oil change on a 2018 Honda/Toyota is $50-75 and $75-150 on a German car.
813 2018-10-27 21:33:54 One of my very favorites. (It's almost always my 'cheat meal' once a week.) I fry diced potatoes in my electric frying pan with olive oil, until they're *really* browned, then, I put an egg, over easy, on top of them, break the yolk and dig IN. *So* good!

820 2018-10-27 21:32:07 Well tomatoes... Olive oil counts?
821 2018-10-27 21:31:57 Maybe because they use a lot much sesame oil and some very strange fermented ingredients
822 2018-10-27 21:31:56 The moment you realize how quickly everyone gets over a death of a loved one, is also the moment you’ll stop trying to please everyone.
823 2018-10-27 21:31:44 pls I want to know which pain you are causing them, is it the large prayer they get from the Muslim Ummah that'll cause the pain?
824 2018-10-27 21:31:43 Turkey are the biggest importer of Iran oil.  So since they are number 1, it wont be that hard to figure out what kind of oil they get from Iran.
825 2018-10-27 21:31:43 $32 TRILLION for bank bailouts, using society's resources to bail them out.  Public is subsiding the oil industry in the US, the pharma industry, the tech industry, the war industry, the agriculture/food industry... yet, USA is at the top of the totem poll in power.
826 2018-10-27 21:31:33 Nothing is more relaxing than a hair oil massage from your mother.
827 2018-10-27 21:31:26 Venezuela a country with $132 bn dollar debt to US/China -so a currency they can’t create. One industry:crude oil. Import everything. Black market. Price of oil crash. Drought. So Hyperinflation prior to money printing. Nothing like the U.K. unless oil found in Home Counties?
828 2018-10-27 21:31:02 Gaz oil ce soir , 1,649 le litre ...
829 2018-10-27 21:30:56 Its just manky. I refuse to buy it. Am i a snob? I could not see how it would even cook properly. Full of oil.give me original all day long
830 2018-10-27 21:30:44 Now go find a ghost pepper. They are HOT!!!! Ate one this morning in some soup, glad I cut it up in small bits and had oil in the soup.
831 2018-10-27 21:30:40 I was legit a few miles away from blowing my engine.. thank you Edith for that free oil change sis 
832 2018-10-27 21:30:30 Google 'canada oil and gas subsidies' and read the credible sources. Google the other topics to find similar.
833 2018-10-27 21:30:19 Having some food, logging on then. Who’s up for an oil show tonight?
834 2018-10-27 21:30:16 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
835 2018-10-27 21:29:57 More welfare for the oil industry that has screwed you over?
All the while you plan on screwing over your farmers and everyone else.
Oil is a dead end, only the thieves trying to steal money pretend it isn't.
836 2018-10-27 21:29:30 Palm oil is not a healthy oil to eat. Awful for health, awful for the environment.

838 2018-10-27 21:28:49 No PETRO is the oil industries biggest fear.  Honestly, I hate it but think it was a smart move to circumvent debt payments to the USA and other major powers.   But it is a good reason to get rid of fossil fuels all together.  Than The Earth wins.
839 2018-10-27 21:28:45 Yep! I use a balm that is natural and has cinnamon and clove oil and it’s amazing!!

850 2018-10-27 21:25:58 I have 2 herniated disks in my neck and cervical stenosis. I found Recovery Balm from Lemongrass Spa. I apply it to my neck/shoulder muscles and rub in. It helps me SO much and it’s natural. Has cinnamon and clove oil that are like magic!

855 2018-10-27 21:25:13 Based on my experience, things are moving the right way - a doc even added gluten as an allergy on my chart.  Not sure I'm actually allergic (still not tested), but will take it over the eye rolling & snake oil warnings, ha!   Even though it takes time, I can see the progress

857 2018-10-27 21:24:51 Cars will need to have gas refilled and there will be an oil check gauge.  Being arrested will have realtime sentences.  You *will* have muti-day trials.  You'll have Internet and cell phone bills or else missions become unavailable.  Health insurance goes up with each wound/ambu
858 2018-10-27 21:24:16 @thatSLAYERchick I'm sorry you're going through this, my heart truly goes out to you because i can understand exactly what you're going through.
Just remember to take care of yourself too, tea tree oil is amazing for breakouts & chamomile & lavender tea can help you wind down :)
859 2018-10-27 21:24:10 If there was no oil in the world these so called princes and kings who are corrupt just like fat western politicians would be wearing rags. You should earn your titles wankas.

862 2018-10-27 21:23:50 Of course they are out to make as much money as possible and it’s the poorest that get screwed! I’m sure tariffs will shoot up in March due to Brexit regardless if it has any effect! It’s the same as petrol/diesel! Why’s it so dear when oil prices are way lower than in the past?

867 2018-10-27 21:23:33 Because Canada’s Imperial owners founded the colony in genocide and theft & both @CPC_HQ & @Liberal_Party still exist to serve racist foreign oligarchs demanding @JustinTrudeau & @RachelNotley use Canada’s state monopoly on violence to dispossess & destroy FN’s for oil. #cdnpoli
868 2018-10-27 21:23:29 Wow. Question to Andy and Company. How is Trudeau hurting the oil industry. Harper had 10 years to get oil to tidewater. NADA. Trudeau moves to get it done and is stopped by the courts because Harper’s environmental process is flawed. So tell me...who is the real culprit???
869 2018-10-27 21:23:24 arrived at the Gar-ridge fer a oil change
870 2018-10-27 21:23:08 And increasing deficit can come from increased expenditure in/on Scotland and also reduced revenue in/from Scotland. Perhaps, say, a dramatic decline in oil taxation revenue?
871 2018-10-27 21:22:39 America has; invaded multiple nations to steal OIL, destabilized governments, installed dictators, supported oppressive regimes, murdered civilians & assassinated heads of state! Who will sanction America? #SaudiArabia #Iran #Iraq #Syria #Yemen #Afghanistan #Venezuela #Libya

873 2018-10-27 21:22:34 Not happening, coincidental indicator. Oil goes higher from here. State wants cheap oil (stealth QE) physics don't agree. With 3.5% global decline rate & 1% demand growth the world needs a new Iraq each & every year.

878 2018-10-27 21:21:11 Oil need to score on this PP. you can’t go 1/7 #oilers #yeg #preds
879 2018-10-27 21:21:08 SETS OFF THE FIRE ALARM. COCONUT OIL.
880 2018-10-27 21:21:08 I put it in a bowl in a pot of boiling water  with some coconut oil for easy melting
881 2018-10-27 21:21:05 Home alone with our 7 m/o baby, so time to get into the #dadzone:  burning frankincense oil and playing the darkest techno the internet has to offer
882 2018-10-27 21:21:02 Best oil effort and yet ANOTHER leap forward this season
883 2018-10-27 21:20:56 Ginger and oil of oregano.  There is a roll on called Migra Sooth. It is peppermint oil. Feel better love
884 2018-10-27 21:20:47 Coconut oil will get it off.
885 2018-10-27 21:20:44 I meant organo (organo oil or oil of organo.). OrgOno is a silica base liquid you can drink that’s really helpful too for joint pain but organo plant is an herb, like canibus. That was what I meant to compare:)
886 2018-10-27 21:20:33 Get back from IL & my daddy changed my oil, rotated my tires, put washer fluid in and put air in my tires. Yes I’m very much spoiled but oh well 
887 2018-10-27 21:20:26 #OOC They were lucky to strike oil with Ronda..I thought she would be a flop but she's actually making strides. For her sake they better not drop the ball.
888 2018-10-27 21:20:25 The snp did it in 2014 white paper . 

Thought estimates were fine back then. 

Oil tax rev would be 8.8bn 《《

It was 0bn 

Small margins 
889 2018-10-27 21:20:24 I use coconut oil for everything
890 2018-10-27 21:20:23 おはようございます。張り切って行きましょう
891 2018-10-27 21:20:18 I think I have it worked out now: 97% of the world's scientists conspired to create an imaginary evironmental crisis, only to have it exposed by a plucky band of billionaires, politicians and oil companies.
892 2018-10-27 21:20:14 Lavender oil. Cold cloth to the head and lay down in a dark room
893 2018-10-27 21:20:09 You have to bear in mind that many separatists believe that rUK would actually be begging Indy Scotland for whisky, oil, and water. So what actual steps would you take to mitigate the border effect?
894 2018-10-27 21:19:47 Akin to the American Geological Survey saying (in 1919) that peak oil would be in 1921 if not late 1920.
895 2018-10-27 21:19:43 Meanwhile you ask the feds for more welfare for the oil industry while your farmers get screwed over.
Sounds like you are only serving the richest people.
896 2018-10-27 21:19:43 My back is killing me, why is it that having someone in my life to rub cannabis oil on it seems to be too much to ask of the universe?
897 2018-10-27 21:19:42 can't talk about this without noting that fossil fuel extraction (coal, oil, gas) is the one positive economic development for large chunks of rural PA these days. a job at a decent wage is a heck of a political motivator.
898 2018-10-27 21:19:29 The sunrise looks like an oil painting rn
899 2018-10-27 21:19:29 Getting an oil change is always fun, the price depends on whether or not I’m alone and how broke I tell them I am.
900 2018-10-27 21:19:23 The GT runs on oil.

908 2018-10-27 21:18:34 i think it’s the laffy taffy and they can get away with being listed as vegan because not everyone thinks of palm oil since it’s not derived from animals or their byproducts but i know some people object to eating it.. technically they are vegan but it’s personal preference
909 2018-10-27 21:18:25 おはようございますー
910 2018-10-27 21:18:09 Guess you could call us  Albertan’s, CIVILIZED REDNECKS!! But don’t ever underestimate us!” 

Trudeau has slowly destroyed AB’s oil industry.Where are the protests?I see none. If this happened to Ont's auto industry there would be riots in the streets of Windsor, Oakville &Oshawa
911 2018-10-27 21:18:05 Marinade your chicken in olive oil, orange juice, lemon juice &amp; pepper. Healthy can be delicious.
912 2018-10-27 21:18:04 Oil and Water Don’t Mix And Neither does messy and Anointed!
913 2018-10-27 21:18:03 As the hypocrisy continues from reverend Emma Jackson. 

Hear yee! Hear yee!
Quit using oil!
Do as I say! Not as I do! 
Be a real leader and quit benifiting by using oil derivatives.
914 2018-10-27 21:18:01 What's true is electric motors combined with say Tesla Coils will go from 0 to full speed instantly. The traction would be the only problem. They will run circles around an oil powered engine. But I do like the sound of a big V8.

918 2018-10-27 21:17:40 @realDonaldTrump I just want to say a sentence, if you exempt a country from the oil embargo, and do not cut off Swift, you not only oppressed the Iranian people, but oppressed humanity.

928 2018-10-27 21:14:59 @jeep we have been totally disappointed with Jeep! 700 miles on a new Cherokee, smelled burning New from the factory with no O ring on the vacuum pump. Fixed that then smelled more burning now the engine has to be taken apart to stop the oil leak in the engine  Chrysler no help!

939 2018-10-27 21:12:55 Sir, don’t put that on your baby’s head. Oil her scalp with a jojoba oil and tea tree oil blend. Moisten her hair with water or @AlikayNaturals lemongrass leave-in and seal it with shea butter. All that other stuff is gunk. What do you cleanse and condition her hair with?
940 2018-10-27 21:12:51 man... i suck at oil painting...

942 2018-10-27 21:12:35 For exfoliating:

-baking soda 
-honey
-vitamin E oil
-cinnamon
-milk

Combine all ingredients till it becomes a paste
943 2018-10-27 21:12:34 When’s the oil bubble gonna burst?
944 2018-10-27 21:12:28 There is an oil leak in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico four miles down that is spewing 1000s of gallons of oil every day into the gulf. No one is doing a damn thing about it because they know how to drill for that oil but when something goes wrong they have no clue about a fix.
945 2018-10-27 21:12:26 You do know the power of autism #oil
946 2018-10-27 21:12:09 Good, I think it’s idiotic to burn oil when it’s much more useful being turned into plastic and chemicals.  There’s a finite supply of oil and imagining an industrial world run without the benefits of oil is very difficult.

964 2018-10-27 21:09:35 How stupid would you have to be to tell your shareholders "Our goal for the next 10 years is to make less money." Seems a risky strategy if you like being an oil company executive. No one plans for the government and NGOs to make a mockery of the regulatory process.

976 2018-10-27 21:07:23 Question for the Alfisti: Do I leave the engine oil in the boot of the car or not? I know it needs it occasionally, but the new owner doesn't. #AlfaRomeo @boosplodge @_Alfista
977 2018-10-27 21:07:20 Snake oil is very appealing.
978 2018-10-27 21:07:13 Yeah, always said what the Pacific NW needs is more oil trains and mining, and less trees. Sigh.
979 2018-10-27 21:06:46 I have to disagree. He's openly selling our defenses to SA. Who is in turn committing the largest Genocide our generation will see since WW2. For oil. He's not going to stop, because he has other business dealings that would fail if he were to choose between what's right or $$$

There’s is a fake “recruitment agency” online sending job seekers offer letters from non-existent oil companies and then they ask you to pay an amount of money as acceptance of the job etc before they send;
982 2018-10-27 21:06:32 The Council on Foreign Relations runs amok in Washington and the sheeple are cheerleading the state sponsored terrorism. I still think Europe has an open chance if they work with Russia, Turkey, and China. However, they'll have to drop the dollar first then buy Iranian oil.

997 2018-10-27 21:04:46 Red wine vinegar? Loads of smushy berries, the juice from which makes salads yummy, especially with chicken? Olive oil?
998 2018-10-27 21:04:37 I seriously doubt we'll make convenience food go away any time soon. Barring that, manufacturers shifting to things like no added sugar, olive vs seed oil, no starch fillers, etc., is a positive step.
999 2018-10-27 21:04:25 Make sure the snake oil is really unsafe for consumption too.

1004 2018-10-27 21:03:56 That only is a reasonable statement when terrorists attack or threaten to attack our way of life. When a tragedy has taken place it is UP TO YOU to act like a leader, not a snake oil salesman. You continue to conjure hate everywhere you go. Your words of unity are hollow. Empty.

1023 2018-10-27 21:01:09 Mine were adopted one at a time. The first two were BFFs, and the third bonded with the first, but two and three are oil and water. At least I don't live in a studio.

1028 2018-10-27 21:00:29 someone should wash your mouth out with soap... or gun oil.
1029 2018-10-27 21:00:20 October 27, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1030 2018-10-27 21:00:09 Oil company Petroplus Holdings AG was also chasing L. Reijtenbagh in 2009, claiming he stole €40 mill. Petroplus was Europe's largest independent oil refiner by capacity. Now defunct, it was first formed in 1993 & was known as Petroplus International N.V. based in Netherlands.
1031 2018-10-27 21:00:05 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.

1037 2018-10-27 20:59:31 Beard oil is also a necessity. Alot of beards don't grow because of split ends and breakage
1038 2018-10-27 20:59:08 Beard oil isn't a "thing". Fucking cut it out already.
1039 2018-10-27 20:59:02 OIL ?! OPEN THE DOOR MOTHERFUCKER !
1040 2018-10-27 20:58:56 Have you tried the cannabis oil? I have a friend that vapes it, he says it works, his dr also gave him THC, whatever it is, says that helps him to. Just a thought.
1041 2018-10-27 20:58:51 Only him! or the many countries making money with the sale of weapons in this war & the ones who want an extra piece of land and 
Syria natural resources include iron ore, crude oil, phosphate rock, manganese ore, asphalt, marble, rock salt, and gypsum  #GolanHeights #saudicrimes
1042 2018-10-27 20:58:47 Sunflower oil is a crime against humanity
1043 2018-10-27 20:58:37 Incorrect. Rapeseed oil in the UK is cold pressed and not necessarily GM. Buy from a reputable producer like @YorkshireOil. High in Omega 3!

1053 2018-10-27 20:57:02 Trump starts the fire and people around him add oil to the flame!
1054 2018-10-27 20:56:46 Other large countries have also been in play within the Latin American region as oil is a big factor.

1062 2018-10-27 20:55:09 bush lied about WMD and killed a million iraqis for oil....don't white wash his presidency. he said what he said about islam to appease the saudis, his business partners, while creating a muslim registry in this country. Bush is no more a hero or decent human being than turmp is.
1063 2018-10-27 20:54:59 Oil, seasoning, salt and other spices.
1064 2018-10-27 20:54:51 And Mulroney did invest billions in the oil industry in Newfoundland. Against advice given which still brings revenue to the Feds.

1066 2018-10-27 20:54:43 @MBuhari is all for continuity. Either you eat from the tree or use the tree as shade, the tree is still useful for us all. GEJ could have completely the project with the oil money Nigeria was making at the time. But that’s a completely different argument.
1067 2018-10-27 20:54:17 @_meeymarhbello
1068 2018-10-27 20:54:12 Oh my. It’s not even doable if you raise my taxes to 60%. Sweden taxes 60%, they take on oil royalties, and their pop is 8 million. Canadians come here and pay cash for serious surgeries.
1069 2018-10-27 20:54:09 Shame it contains Palm Oil.
1070 2018-10-27 20:53:59 She also plagiarized lyrics from midnight oil on it lol....
1071 2018-10-27 20:53:57 But cost of ownership is so much lower than ICE because it has less moving parts and doesn’t require regular oil changes and servicing 
1072 2018-10-27 20:53:40 Dorian Baker has hands of oil.
1073 2018-10-27 20:53:28 Yesterday after work I came home to a baked cake, Reece’s, a card, and coconut oil. I’m so blessed thank you princess

1079 2018-10-27 20:52:24 @oil_shaeikh I fit wash plates based on extra job
1080 2018-10-27 20:52:02 And if they shut down the oil sands tomorrow, what cut in national CO2 would that get us? They would need to ban all new natural gas hook-ups & tax the living crap out of any vehicle bigger than a Fiat 500. Financial ruin beckons & the frigid poor house our final destination.
1081 2018-10-27 20:51:45 A little salt and pepper garlic oil boom

1084 2018-10-27 20:51:25 I believe the reasons are more simple : SA is the untouchable Muslim nation that spreads $ to both parties, impacts every industry using crude oil, & is part of Trump family interests. ( Even Islamophobes give them a pass.) His dismemberment was recorded. Our govt was involved.

1096 2018-10-27 20:49:48 Agreed Bruce, really good effort by the Oil; I'm actually starting to experience sentiments of giddiness for this season...
1097 2018-10-27 20:49:45 Confession- I haven’t eaten or used soy oil or any other form of soy in 15 years. Today I said what could happen. Ate fair food. Soy is truly evil.
1098 2018-10-27 20:49:42 The first time was from Claire’s but when I got my nose pierced it was by a legit piercer & it still almost happened again but I used tea tree oil to stop it. But surgery scars are bigger so I’m just worried how to deal with that ;_;
1099 2018-10-27 20:49:20 I voted yes on Colorado's Proposition 112. Why? Because I value the environment more than jobs and money. I will do whatever possible to make the oil and gas industry suffer. Not sorry at all.

1106 2018-10-27 20:48:39 And immediately opened it up to oil drilling.
1107 2018-10-27 20:48:39 Vote Yes on #Prop112 and reject everything oil and gas supports. The planet and lives are more important than special interests.
1108 2018-10-27 20:48:36 I've a Landrover Discovery 4, #lloydlandrover that has had an oil pump failure 2 years ago and seized the engine, requiring a new engine, in has happened again today 25k miles later, that's 2 blown engines in 2 years.
 I don't understand???????? :( :( 
Can you assist #Landrover?
1109 2018-10-27 20:48:34 I know what the Howey test is. Still doesn't change my position. XRP is to Ripple what oil is to Exxon.

1111 2018-10-27 20:48:14 - Shitty "brown gravy" (not fancy stuff)
- Frozen steak fries (avoid seasoning)
- The best (cheddar pref.) cheese curds you can get
1. Cook fries as directed
2. Cook gravy. Keep warm.
3. Brush fries with olive oil, broil on high for 1-2 mins per side.
4. Fries -> Curds -> Gravy
1112 2018-10-27 20:48:06 @meinekecarcare #meinekeracers Tweeting for my free oil changes. College is expensive.
1113 2018-10-27 20:48:05 Countries were quick to condemn Russia during the Salisbury poisonings of a traitor Russian spy (and his daughter) , not so with Saudi Arabia (and the unexplained disappearance of an honest journalist). Oil money speaks louder than morality. Moral corruption is rampant.
1114 2018-10-27 20:48:04 Lavender oil, rub it on your temples. I suffer from migraines  since a teenager so sometimes I use a script, but the lavender works well
1115 2018-10-27 20:47:58 No matter how many times you repeat a lie doesn't make it true.  So please stop saying that more major oil infrastructure is a great idea, because it is a terrible idea and I wish that the oil corporations that own the Alberta government could see that and move on.
1116 2018-10-27 20:47:41 Can’t mix #twitter and #Instagram it’s like trying to mix oil with water = nope. #Facebook & #Twitter don’t mix. #GetTheFacts #wink
1117 2018-10-27 20:47:37 She went to work on the pasta, first adding a little bit of cooking oil, and then mixing in some noodles into a pan. This is the quicker way to make pasta, but just as good. 

❝No. no. Not this time. I think it’s about time we take a break from the traditions of the old.——
1118 2018-10-27 20:47:31 Sim..daniel nigri falou dos riscos da queda do valor do litro de gasolina q esta sendo repassado (caindo dia apos dia) alem da queda do Brent oil..30 esta no VALOR JUSTO.nao concorda, professor?
1119 2018-10-27 20:47:25 Actually, what's really costing us now is lack of pipelines. The discount on our oil is approx $45 US a barrel, which equates to about half a billion every week. But sure, keep telling us to ignore that, and focus on a tiny increase in global temps.
1120 2018-10-27 20:47:19 Pick seeds from flesh

1125 2018-10-27 20:46:33 2 v.good periods from the Oil, a couple of wobbles, but this just in: Nashville is good. Am worried about Larsson, there are no in-house replacements for him, let's hope it's "just" stitches. Awful to see him & Leon go down the tunnel in rapid succession gushing from head wounds.

1129 2018-10-27 20:45:38 They just can't decide who gets the most oil! 
1130 2018-10-27 20:45:17 It’s not enough to be against anti-oil sentiment anymore...we need Canadians, particularly younger generations, to be actively PRO oil. Otherwise, we’re going to continue selling our economic future to the U.S. for $20/barrel & buying it back from them at $70. #oilandgas #cndpoli
1131 2018-10-27 20:45:16 Oof, word to the wise, don't stuff waffle irons in cupboards never to be seen again... they'll find a way to leak some sort of sticky oil everywhere 
1132 2018-10-27 20:45:04 This guy (Obama) can sell snake oil, but he was divisive as they come for 8 years. Beware the silver tongued deceiver.
1133 2018-10-27 20:44:57 Oh no! Haters who don't know what they're talking about are upset that oil is being extracted from the land.
1134 2018-10-27 20:44:56 ohh I probably do have olive oil somewhere lol  if I remember I'll try it next time! ; ; maybe I'll invest in a real remover/cleanser.. someday.... lol 
1135 2018-10-27 20:44:55 Mission completed, flautas done! I baked them vs fried. 

I brushed them with a mix of avocado oil, garlic, and adobo. Do you have a secret to making them crunchy in the oven? 
1136 2018-10-27 20:44:53 No fan needs to be reminded of the #Oilers history in matinee games. That being said, with their performance today in a matinee matchup against the best team in the NHL, the Oil are destined for the playoffs. A completely different team than what we saw last season.

1138 2018-10-27 20:44:40 What’s with the “shut up?” Have we got another Trump lover? He’s in oil and gas so it’s a monetary thing!
1139 2018-10-27 20:44:31 Bob this is the best I've seen the oil all season. Looch standing out big time. All the big money players are playing big!
1140 2018-10-27 20:44:29 Snake Oil Salesman, aka Rev Al Sharpton. Never misses an opportunity to slander POTUS.
1141 2018-10-27 20:44:27 I'm right between you, then (approximately). I was 11, and remember it so well. I was at the game that season when they won the pennant. (Oil Can Boyd pitching vs. Toronto). $6 bleacher seats!
1142 2018-10-27 20:44:09 HERE WE GO OILERS HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO OILERS HERE WE GO!!!!! 3 TO 1 FOR THE OIL

1166 2018-10-27 20:41:01 More pathetic subversion. 
You're like the family member EVERYONE else in the family hates to see show up at the reunion despite their internal differences.

1181 2018-10-27 20:39:17 I’ve had migraines since I was 8. Mix peppermint and lavender essential oils with a carrier oil (I like coconut oil). Rub some on your temples and behind your ears. Drop some on a tissue and lay it on your pillow next to your head
1182 2018-10-27 20:39:00 6. Wipe pan with some olive oil, use kitchen paper. 7. Use a big pan and ladle out 2 small pancakes to fit. 8. Once you see bubbles start to rise, should be time to turn over. 9. Serve with crispy bacon & maple syrup or fresh fruit & cream  #Enjoy 
1183 2018-10-27 20:38:39 Last time I was at the dealer to get my oil changed my battery “just happened to die” and I had to replace it. Today they tell me they can’t pull the dipstick out to pour the oil (eventually they did). I must have moron printed on my face or something every time I go there.

Global oil prices fell drastically and went into recession.

1190 2018-10-27 20:37:06 Okay,  educate us. Despite oil boom we couldn't save,  our reserves keep on diminishing, FG was borrowing money to pay salary, was the economy not doomed for recession. The good thing is that buharinomics broight us out of it. #idiat

1201 2018-10-27 20:35:06 In 1890, Standard Oil controlled 88% of the U.S. oil market.

No, it was not a 100% monopoly, but then those almost never exist.

By 1904, it controlled 91% of production and 85% of end sales.
1202 2018-10-27 20:35:05 So why is it ok to give money to them oh cause they have oil so they get a pass but their values are no better than other countries in the region

1210 2018-10-27 20:33:55 It's more than time that we reduce our thirst for all fossil fuels, no matter the point of extraction, but ending subsidies towards them.  We need to stop designing the world to require oil to run, and we need not return to stone age in the process.
1211 2018-10-27 20:33:53 This video is horrible but something needs to be done ASAP. I’d invade the countries who allow it just to be able to stop it. Don’t countries invade other countries for oil? Why not invade to protect the ACTUAL PLANET and the animals who were here LOOOOONG before us. #BanHunting

1216 2018-10-27 20:32:44 Standard Oil had an effective monopoly on oil products for some years. It formed that monopoly in the free market, absent government assistance or regulation.

That's how we ended up with some of our antitrust laws.

1234 2018-10-27 20:30:11 yes but the actual dirty secret is that all this is all at everyone else's cost through the sales of oil with it's huge co2 emissions  - so not really a green economy at all is it !

1292 2018-10-27 20:21:16 There is no doubt that oil payment deferral will reduce c/a deficit. This will help Pakistan’s position in negotiations with IMF. The point I was making is that currency depreciation won’t have large impact on improvement in c/a due to inelastic imports.

1303 2018-10-27 20:19:26 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.
1304 2018-10-27 20:19:15 Also cbd oil is missing in research. Im hesitant to give it thumbs up but people are defo asking a lot more about it

1308 2018-10-27 20:18:37 Probably not good if the oil has set on fire anyway
1309 2018-10-27 20:18:30 Just do some quick google searches for the Oil industry and you'll see they are ALL ramping up production, starting new 30 - 40 years deals... Exxon is in the middle of a huge deal with Russia, and there's no end in site for the Oil Biz..  Well, the End in site Is Life.
1310 2018-10-27 20:18:24 What? Fast food has a taste that isn’t oil?

1312 2018-10-27 20:18:22 Peppermint oil, make sure it says that you can use on your skin. Place at temples, back of neck. You're eyes will water for a minute. But it does work.
1313 2018-10-27 20:18:20 I just spent $120 at Jiffy Lube for an oil change.  I’m big mad.
1314 2018-10-27 20:18:02 Potential $TSLA headlines. $TSLA & $APPL  will announce a partnership.  @wrrenbuffet take stake in $TSLA. India invites @elonmusk to open  a factory to build a smaller EV car to reduce dependency on oil and build new solar power plants. FBI & DOJ will lay low past election.
1315 2018-10-27 20:17:45 If Saudis take down Iran, trump takes credit, and his family & MBS take the oil revenues as spoils. Meanwhile, he’s declaring himself a nazi, (long version), Jamal Kashoggi was torture murdered, & it’s open season on churches & synagogues. #ButHerEmails
1316 2018-10-27 20:17:39 Trump tries to cover up his complicity - his leadership, his throwing oil on the flames - in violence against anyone who is not a radical right-wing nationalist in the fascist Trumpian mode. No, Donald. America rejects you and your transparent attempts to dodge responsibility.
1317 2018-10-27 20:17:29 Wish you also cared enough for those bombed in Yemen in daily basis. Women and children massacred in the name of oil and money

1323 2018-10-27 20:16:59 Since Venezuela had no plan for if Oil crashes, that's why they are in ruin. Bolivia and Ecuador are also booming and they're quite socialist.

1325 2018-10-27 20:16:29 Matthew Harding, oil rig workers. Doesn't seem the safest form of travel.

1327 2018-10-27 20:16:05 Of course working in a restaurant, if that person we're to use "chili oil" rather than pepper spray it looks like your own fault after the fact.

1332 2018-10-27 20:15:27 Venezuela's issues also stem from Oil, which the US imports a shit ton of. Other countries had the same issues as Venezuela even though they aren't socialist, like Iran and Iraq
1333 2018-10-27 20:15:18 Is it just me or does it stress you out when you have to get your oil changed?

1347 2018-10-27 20:13:23 Okay quickie poll because I need a decision within the hour:

Do I cover water colours or oil paints first?
1348 2018-10-27 20:13:21 Not a theory look it up bush Laden family oil connection!!! Oh well...trump spewing hate and bin Laden spewing hate got the same results...
1349 2018-10-27 20:13:01 Did you use a piece of plastic today? See, now, that's exactly why we need oil. Any questions?  #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming

1351 2018-10-27 20:12:17 If you study the major players of WWII, it’s mind boggling how many of them were really anti-Semitic. The money, machinery, substances (lethal gases), etc. that went in to kill Jews in Europe. And the corporations: IBM, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Standard Oil, etc.
1352 2018-10-27 20:12:10 Hot water, tiny bit of Dawn, a glug of mint oil (or mint extract, whatever you got), in a spray bottle. Miraculous. Gets rid of all rl ants, but not the ones on your timeline :)
1353 2018-10-27 20:11:51 @GordonRamsay One question that I always had watching your videos is: Is it good to use olive oil when frying very hot stuff? Since the olive oil gets ruined quickly under high heat. Is that true?
1354 2018-10-27 20:11:47 Trusting anything to do with oil ownership, production  distribution ... mmm ... let me think?
1355 2018-10-27 20:11:28 Olive Oil Times! I was amused. They must really like olive oil.

Oil is probably a bit past it's used by date now...
1356 2018-10-27 20:11:05 You must have shares in Oil of Ulay #properchels
1357 2018-10-27 20:11:03 The oil industry just got another $4.5 billion in fed money. They contribute 5-6% of our GDP.
Farming in Canada contributed 6.7% to our GDP in 2016. New trade agreements will see that climb.
How many $billions did the AG sector get this year?
1358 2018-10-27 20:10:54 とりあえず3万目標の5万狙おう
1359 2018-10-27 20:10:53 I will open and close the gate untill it squeaks. I will oil it and reopen and close for breeze to pass sef.
1360 2018-10-27 20:10:51 “Reaching your creative potential in multiple ways” sounds like a euphemism for what might happen after consuming too much space dust, olive oil and high cocoa count chocolate.
1361 2018-10-27 20:10:47 200 for a oil change I’m doing it myself lol

1371 2018-10-27 20:09:52 Here our chairborne incompetent mod bureaucracy is busy in slugfest on soldiers rather than burning mid night oil to hoodwink crooks to acquire new weapons.

Really looking forward to seeing oil derricks on my drive on PCH (US 1) from Malibu to Santa Monica. The Pacific Ocean already looks like root beer in the winter every time it rains for 3 days straight.
1374 2018-10-27 20:09:06 Guaranteed jobs with livable wages. Finland UBA was designed fail by RW to discourage anyone trying that. Some RW guys are pretty evil & don't have empathy for other humans. What about Alaska sharing with all oil profits?
1375 2018-10-27 20:08:43 But the real question is, if you were so inclined and insane enough could you still eat it?

Also, I am extremely amused to know that there's an entire website dedicated solely to olive oil.
1376 2018-10-27 20:08:35 Democrat and Honesty two things that don't go together. Like oil and water

1384 2018-10-27 20:07:49 On the first pages of @bethanymac12’s #SaudiAmerica. Amazing how similar her portrayal of Aubrey McClenon (fracking titan and oil mogul) is to @elonmusk - a combination of genius/visionary/buffoon/con man who turned the world upside down.
1385 2018-10-27 20:07:47 Idk if it would help but my nails were brittle so I used to soak them in olive oil
1386 2018-10-27 20:07:46 Exfoliate with coffee beans once a week. Cleanse twice a day, tone with witch hazel, then moisturize with coconut oil
1387 2018-10-27 20:07:42 So today Bally realised the reason her hair was so damaged was because she'd been using out of date coconut oil for the past six months

1404 2018-10-27 20:06:06 you COHEN KAPO SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.JEWS (are you) like you ENABLED FDR, the ENABLER OF HITLER. think FORD MOTORS for German truck, STANDARD OIL, for Nazis,enabling Nazi finanes through Swiss Banks. with latest technology, NOW, we know. I DID NOT CHOOSE OBAMA EVER, U DID
1405 2018-10-27 20:06:01 Yup. I saw this exact scenario play out in the oil field when OPEC flooded the market. The small operations don’t have enough money to survive a total lack of income long term. But the big corporate operations do. When these small farms fold, the big ones will buy them.
1406 2018-10-27 20:05:54 
1407 2018-10-27 20:05:45 If "circular debt" is local, then it never causes a problem.
Rs. 1,200 billion circular debt is not causing economic crises & government can pay it by printing notes (however, it will increase inflation)
But imports of $20 billion oil & gas annually has ruined our economy

1412 2018-10-27 20:04:27 The logs were really hot, it is a good hardwood. Oil has gone up considerably this year though. Will have to snuggle 'round the fire more.

1415 2018-10-27 20:04:18 vape oil. Please I must see
1416 2018-10-27 20:04:13 Peppermint oil mixed with coconut oil helps
1417 2018-10-27 20:04:02 Why are we even still using oil? I want alternatives now!
1418 2018-10-27 20:03:54 Can everyone take a minute to pray for me. The first horse I bought on Red Dead 2 has passed away. She was shot to death while trying to rob an oil buggy. 
1419 2018-10-27 20:03:43 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
1420 2018-10-27 20:03:38 Greed is the cause of all wars, imperialism adding to that. People can have an agenda that may be religiously based it is not the cause of all wars. Oil was the cause of the Iraq war. Seizing territory in South Africa during the Boer  Wars wasn't religiously driven. Greed was
1421 2018-10-27 20:03:36 If you can take the smell of these various oils mix in a few drops of essentual oil scents you enjoy. I keep it simple with a few drops of pepermint oil but you can jazz it up with other scents like citrus and black pepper
1422 2018-10-27 20:03:27 @umang961 tu nhi sambhal payega inn dono ko. Baccha sa toh dekh rha hu. Growp up, hot oil se massage kara kar.

Just go to a starbucks and destress that way. 

I had to go get an oil change so i asked them to drop me off at a starbucks and it was so relaxing, i havent felt this comfortable in months
1428 2018-10-27 20:02:40 @RealDanQuayle gas and oil, receiving stolen property!  All of it then, having the nerve to fight me over this!  Amazing!
1429 2018-10-27 20:02:33 I guess none of his wealthy sponsors needed it for an oil well.
1430 2018-10-27 20:02:15 Kara frowned. Who said anything about suicide? No. This was just a prank. It wasn't even a real knife. It was just smeared in glo oil. Kara had wanted to prank Lena.

This was boring. She rolled her eyes, "Fine. Fine! No tricks. No games."
Kara threw away the knife.
"I got++
1431 2018-10-27 20:02:12 I’m literally a grown ass child... my parents told me to take their car back to WV cause mine needs an oil change. 
1432 2018-10-27 20:02:08 Looks like a bearing (which can hold oil) may have gone. If still under warranty I'd look into that asap.
1433 2018-10-27 20:02:07 Living our life of ease comes with fixed costs including supporting what ever regime will result in a smooth oil supply.
The UK for example could only feed 4 - 5 million people by traditional agriculture.
I suspect never having experienced hunger informs your moral rectitude.
1434 2018-10-27 20:02:00 @masoninman Really enjoyed 'Oracle.' Finally got to it. I'd consider it the third pillar in the oil series, after 'Titan' by Chernow and 'The Prize' by Yergin. 
1435 2018-10-27 20:01:33 Medicare is one of most efficient operations in the nation as well the Post Office. If you live in Alaska don't the State give you a share of the oil revenue? In Norway all get that but here only a few get that.  What's important is we have a good government for 100%
1436 2018-10-27 20:01:27 Oil Can Boyd
1437 2018-10-27 20:01:17 Oh no. I see how you got that though. 
My battery died. Getting that replaced.
I need new brakes and an oil change
1438 2018-10-27 20:01:13 Need oil for that waist
1439 2018-10-27 20:01:11 When we had oil put in first it was about 100 pound a tank full. Now it nearly 500 x
1440 2018-10-27 20:01:05 I have to say #ToyotaCare is a huge joke @Toyota I fall under severe duty.....10K miles would be every OTHER oil change... I won’t be bringing it in to your cheese ball dealers
1441 2018-10-27 20:01:01 In Texas O’Rourke voted against  tax cuts went against Texas oil workers  O’Rourke got an F from the NRA because he wants to take away citizen's  guns.
1442 2018-10-27 20:00:23 Are Israelis more important to the GOP than Americans because of oh I don’t know                                                     Oil?
1443 2018-10-27 20:00:19 Saw a horrific stat prior to the Caps game that the Oil had only led for 7% of game time so far this year. Since then, we've led for 52 out of the last 80 minutes. #Progress

1446 2018-10-27 19:59:52 Good grief. Your whole career is built on race hustling, lies and spreading hate and division. 
Without it nobody would even know your name.
1447 2018-10-27 19:59:36 They just change the oil, they won't check anything. That's not the issue, don't confuse the two 
1448 2018-10-27 19:59:32 Umm, funded and planned.....LMAO no, history tells is differently......also Bin Laden got rich from daddy bush and baby bush oil money....so really....lmao only family flying out when the whole U.S. grounded was the Laden fam. Sooo you could say 2 U.S. Presidents funded it...

1451 2018-10-27 19:59:08 I know I'm late to this but peppermint oil is great for headaches. If it is really bad use equal parts lavendar, peppermint and frankincense rub on temples and back of neck.
1452 2018-10-27 19:59:05 You want to talk about cowardly? You won't debate your opponent, Dr. Ken Wright for fear of being exposed for leaving our Veterans homeless while you lease their land to oil drillers 200 ft from their hospital? Don't you dare call anyone a coward until you show up for a debate.

1454 2018-10-27 19:58:46 Fracking and good shape don't go together. When the environment is destroyed. And a president who starts a war where oil comes from or puts sanctions on a country who exports oil. Will have an impact on the price.

1456 2018-10-27 19:58:38 I need to research studio safety/ventilation for apartments. I really miss oil painting, but I can't endanger myself + my roommate and her dog with the fumes. D: Digital feels so different though, it's just not the same!
1457 2018-10-27 19:58:38 What’s a velvet painting? If it’s oil based it probably won’t work other than to warp the backing
1458 2018-10-27 19:58:36 Nobody else watched the Salt acid fat heat show so I guess im the only one at this party taking olive oil shots , which is typical
1459 2018-10-27 19:58:05 This is disconcerting giving your representation of the Alberta people and the oil sands, this statement says more to me as an energy worker than you can possibly imagine....

1462 2018-10-27 19:57:42 ...don't bet on it...I reckon the bulk of that ~US$20billion "investment" is in fact a Chinese loan for the construction of an oil refinery in the ECape...oil refineries employ very few unskilled, inexperienced labourers...

1465 2018-10-27 19:57:21 I could relate to that. Id rather have had bozo the clown in office then to have had Hillary in office. It's always the squeaky wheel that gets the oil, and the "alt right" Trump supporters are getting heard this week
1466 2018-10-27 19:57:16 nor will he.  except hope that it just *goes away*.

KSA must be shunned.  no arms sales, no oil sales.  MbS should commit an *honor self-killing* (by sepukku, IMO) in order to bring at least a modicum of respect back to the Kingdom.
1467 2018-10-27 19:56:47 @ChickfilA needs to change their website. They are in fact NOT #glutenfree and can make people with legit celiac disease very VERY sick as they will fry their nuggets “well done” in the same oil. It’s a good thing we asked. Still though. Change your allergy warning.
1468 2018-10-27 19:56:21 I’m not sure why Kreesha Turner still has me blocked. All I did was tell her she needs some oil in her hips..... so dramatic.

1487 2018-10-27 19:53:41 Nigerians are comparing the economy when crude oil price was at an all time high (last 16 years) to when it was at one of its lowest.

The prices of oil are not within the purview of Nig Govt, and our dependence on oil is due to failure of past govt to diversify.

1490 2018-10-27 19:53:32 I can understand God making yo car shut off or a slight oil leak, that’s just him saying take a break or something. But if he take to steering wheel? He won’t say “Don’t you even think about driving” again

1517 2018-10-27 19:50:09 Percentages will be more appropriate, rather than absolute digits.

Also, the changes in the fortunes of the naira due to extreme oil price slump needs to be accounted for... use $ for the calculations.

1554 2018-10-27 19:45:47 To be honest, presidents can only control oil prices so much. In the end supply and demand will come through and as long as we keep fracking we’re in good shape.  100% certainty that Hillary would have made fracking much more difficult.

1557 2018-10-27 19:45:38 I guess everyone needs an extra shirt to wear when they change the oil in their car.
1558 2018-10-27 19:45:32 Four hours?? That is INSANE. For an oil change??
1559 2018-10-27 19:45:32 & yeah this is what we need to think about agendas, what is the motive for say something like climate change ...the agenda on the left is for the purpose of not ruining the planet, there is no other motive, we certainly aren’t getting paid by oil companies to do that.

It's not like Iran has to drastically increase their oil output because of the crippling sanctions we put on them, that the ICJ said were illegal under international law. Iran should just let their economy implode

It has antibacterial properties to help heal, its organic so wont ham Asra nursing, and moisurizing helps the skin anyway

1591 2018-10-27 19:42:26 Good response. I don't know Asia (China's) oil demand delta from2014, was it declining and pressuring the $AUD lower? The $CL reports I delivered to clients then emphasized record U.S. storage, rising production, and rising $DX at the end of QE. Not demand.

1596 2018-10-27 19:41:25 @BlacklionCTA Pretty sure it is simple math based on the debt shale holds and the margin they earn to service that debt. Don't think it was acomment on shale technology etc. Understand the oil price = shale implications.
1597 2018-10-27 19:41:25 You need to step outside your safe space and talk to real Canadians and not just the milk cartel lobbyists and oil companies you shill for.
1598 2018-10-27 19:41:20 Baby oil and soap
1599 2018-10-27 19:41:13 I want to see that day.
1600 2018-10-27 19:41:09 ohh i got you! personally i like oil bc of the texture and it dries way slower than acrylic meaning its easier to fix mistakes. however if you use it you also have to have paint thinner and oil to clean your brushes and make it easier to paint so its more costly overall
1601 2018-10-27 19:41:06 I'm not a hoarder...
I just feel some things might have future value... Who knows?

I might need to write on that oil stained piece of paper
1602 2018-10-27 19:40:52 Wow what a perfectly normal thing to say. How about Putin sucks and so does Trump and the US should stop it's regime change for OIL in Syria?

1604 2018-10-27 19:40:45 someone local makes my oil and i like it, not a sole ingestion method, but it hits my cramps and...grumpy eyebrows? better than others without getting me too stoned. i stopped trying to get a great vape rig tho. i do one of those thin stick pens w/ a single button
1605 2018-10-27 19:40:33 Somethings arent meant to go together, like Oil & Water. Lets just wait and watch, until it repeats inthe politics of Maldives.

1607 2018-10-27 19:40:23 Same with 112 in Colorado. They've paid people to be out holding signs about how it will cost "jobs". 

It's literally just a measure that says you can't build an oil derrick 500 feet from someone's house, instead you have to be 2500 feet. That's it.
1608 2018-10-27 19:40:20 "Girl, she got a candle but forgot to get the oil that she needs to anoint it with. Whew Chile, the forgetful"
1609 2018-10-27 19:40:20 Peppercorn chili oil is more typical Though you’d be making your own.
1610 2018-10-27 19:40:19 the prob at least here w a lot of oil now is that it’s not live resin it’s distillate which for me is a meh experience. for those of us used to a full terpene/cannabinoid high, distillates are pretty wack
1611 2018-10-27 19:40:09 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
1612 2018-10-27 19:40:06 i'm watching this SALT FAT ACID HEAT show and the SALT episode made me stop and take my hypertension pill cocktail. the FAT one made me use too much olive oil for my scrambled eggs. i'll probably burn my place down by the time i get to HEAT.
1613 2018-10-27 19:40:03 Here's how to avoid getting spooked by a broken #condom:

 Check the expiration date on the back of the wrapper
 Use a water-based lubricant, NOT oil, with latex condoms
 Use only one condom at a time

1616 2018-10-27 19:39:29 In my view the Alberta govt and the Trudeau  govt know exactly what they are doing It is kind of like good cop, bad cop Or step into this alley and watch us  move the pea around under the shells,while we rob you. Trudeau did say" we will phase out the oil industry.We were warned.
1617 2018-10-27 19:39:06 I’ll pay someone to come change my oil

1625 2018-10-27 19:37:18 Hurricane sounds sooooo much better when she has her oil changed 
1626 2018-10-27 19:37:13 You cannot understand now without looking at the past, how did NIgeria get into recession?! 

The answer is simple, PDP didn’t save during the oil boom, matter of fact they used that opportunity to steal, looted the treasury dry, now they’re trying to pin recession on Buhari 
1627 2018-10-27 19:37:13 Obama was and still is a traveling snake oil salesman! No doubt swag and charm oozes from his pores, but he’s as disingenuous and dangerous as his backers!
1628 2018-10-27 19:36:59 yea i get the practice part but i'm just confused abt which paint to use there's so many. there's oil, acrylic, gauche, etc. i'm not sure which brands i should buy or which tools i should use, you get me ??
1629 2018-10-27 19:36:59 The price of domestic refined oil is higher than the export price largely due to more than 100% tax rate by the Center and the States
1630 2018-10-27 19:36:56 preds may only have 5 shots but they've heavily outchanced the oil so far
1631 2018-10-27 19:36:42 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines

1635 2018-10-27 19:36:26 I brought some new oil for my dry ass head and honestly it’s amazing , got my hair shiny and smelling good
1636 2018-10-27 19:36:22 I find it too divisive.  After a showdown on gun rights, we've created two vehemently opposed sides, with vast swaths of people firmly dug in.  The idea that there's a middle ground vanishes.  I blame the NRA with its head in the sand.  Similarly I blame oil industry for gridlock
1637 2018-10-27 19:35:58 That's my entire point... If there is more then the Gov is essentially subsidising the cost.  But, the real problem I am worried about is gov has no control, and Big Oil is just going "hog wide" in the worlds 3 largest reserve...

1645 2018-10-27 19:35:19 If we were to light candles on the final eight days, should we begin with eight and end with none (as though oil is running out) or vice versa?
1646 2018-10-27 19:35:13 Their not low status. Many Muslim countries are big powers with a lot of oil. 

In any case, if people have stupid beliefs they should be mocked for their stupidity not assessed on some imaginary heirarchy.

1655 2018-10-27 19:33:39 Before we get that bread we need to get that: 
1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast

2-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)

3 tablespoons sugar

1 tablespoon salt

2 tablespoons canola oil

6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups all-purpose flour

1657 2018-10-27 19:32:52 You can ad #45 supplies SA to commit genocide on Yemen for oil. But that's just business as usual  in politics isn't it? I hate this system we have.

1662 2018-10-27 19:32:18 Every time I hear these words I get really mad Nigeria's unity is not negotiable if I may ask on what grounds ? As far as I know oil & Gas is the only thing holding us together as a nation nothing else binds us together .

1683 2018-10-27 19:28:28 Doesn’t sound like capitalist’s to have the second largest oil reserves and the people starving that sounds something only commies could achieve
1684 2018-10-27 19:28:22 Salmon are a renewable resource, oil and minerals are not. They argue that yes on 1 kills oil and mining jobs and development. Those jobs and development will be gone eventually anyway. Salmon don't have to be the collateral damage of short-sighted thinking.
1685 2018-10-27 19:28:16 Peppermint oil mixed with a carrier oil (castor oil works well) rubbed on the temples. Ice pack on the head and feet in hot water.
1686 2018-10-27 19:28:10 tech was destalizing at the time. The men (controlled by banking/oil families)set up NWO wanted every drop of cash from oil they could get as well as time to institute another way to 'fleece" the sheep &control them..They went the technocrat energy credit model with Carbon.

1692 2018-10-27 19:27:39 Yes, we have portable oil filled radiators and an electric blanket which is a godsend. House is tiny so thankfully not as hard to heat.

He won't have a damn job.  If he could get one that paid decent he wouldn't be Senator.
1701 2018-10-27 19:26:58 If you do buy one, it will almost certainly need a new sponge bar (cheap from eBay) and a good oil...sort those first and save hours of frustration trying to get it to work...

1732 2018-10-27 19:22:33 The split has been manufactured. Think of the value of this asset and then please consider foreign influence may be involved. We have the third largest oil reserve on the planet. That’s a lot of money landlocked by disarray and dischord.

1737 2018-10-27 19:21:32 It's crazy good. I went all out and put it all over my face to see how I liked it, and at first was like, oh noes, that sheen will read as oil, but then it softened so much after a few minutes. And it really does photograph great! But I forgot to take a Before pic.

1740 2018-10-27 19:21:00 Who in the right mind is inspired by Canada? Our economy is about to enter a rescission, our oil is dirt cheap, and Trudeau is funding terrorism with taxpayers money. We get divided when people focus on division, like the liberal party.

1750 2018-10-27 19:19:45 Make & model ?
Does the heater work as normal?
Sounds very much like a sensor problem, or the dashboard guage is faulty.
Has it cut-out on the road?

As long as oil & fluids are right (oo-er) I've done a million miles with shitty dash guages
1751 2018-10-27 19:19:40 yes i wonder if you use minimal oil of
1752 2018-10-27 19:19:36 You're right, govt isnt a business, it just bails out banks, the auto industry, subsidizes the oil industry, etc etc. Why not end the corporate welfare, and give the tax dollars back to the people who provide it, in the form of higher education or universal health care.
1753 2018-10-27 19:19:31 gomes is not a centrist; he partially ran on revoking oil deals with private companies post 2016 because of the "coup." revoking the embraer/boeing deal. complained endlessly about austerity and talked of higher taxes.

1764 2018-10-27 19:17:41 No we don't as the boiler was too old to qualify, TBH the install was cheap and as the chip comes mainly from our own wood it is still far cheaper than oil even without the RHI.
1765 2018-10-27 19:17:39 @GordonRamsay my partner is allergic to everything. What tasty dishes can I make with: chicken, rice, zucchini,  squash,  green peppers,  apples,  cantaloupe,  safflower oil,  green herbs, corn. That's all he can eat 
1766 2018-10-27 19:17:30 Is oil wet?
1767 2018-10-27 19:17:09 ... it's not a dish but an ingredient that I love. Toasted sesame oil.

1783 2018-10-27 19:13:57 Yep, I'd use a sharp steel point to score all over the surface so that something like oil or liquid soap can penetrate.  Acetone only for the final glue, if necessary.
1784 2018-10-27 19:13:46 Who elevated Richard Spencer in media spotlight? The guy had less followers than a backyard BBQ. I had never heard of him before leftist media pretended he was somebody and made him famous. These types have no friends in wider Conservative circles
1785 2018-10-27 19:13:39 None whatsoever, I just don’t style them often coz I’m scared of injips. I treat them at the salon & use coconut oil when I remember to give them a shine. Oh & sone castor oil too sometimes 
1786 2018-10-27 19:13:37 Good point, tackling the role of States and corporations in supporting fossil fuels will be key. more cases or petitions look beyond national emissions, ie.

1795 2018-10-27 19:12:03 So I know coconut oil comes from coconuts, and avacado oil comes from avacados. What does baby oil come from?

1798 2018-10-27 19:11:44 I cracked up at the warning stickers on my Nebuliser that were definitely aimed at not trying to vape cannabis oil through it. I eagerly await more harmless consumption methods. This is the Tech NZ should be working on.

1813 2018-10-27 19:08:32 Canada should operate one refinery and keep its products at home to lower oil/gas prices. Make sure it’s clean refining. We have the technology to do this. It’s time.

1849 2018-10-27 19:02:59 I refuse to pay over $50 for an oil change. Grade A oil is only $25, got me messed up
1850 2018-10-27 19:02:57 Changed my breaks and fixed an oil leap with the help of my future father in law. When I say "help" I mean he did most of the oil leak and two of the brakes while I held the light and learned.

1885 2018-10-27 18:58:38 Is it silicon or water based "gun oil?"  I find just about anything is possible if you use silicon-based.
1886 2018-10-27 18:57:56 (2) You also have to factor in the cost of doing nothing. The billions you and I already pay the military to transport oil, clean up oil spills, health care costs due to polluted air and water, etc.
1887 2018-10-27 18:57:55 I love the aftermath of each time i oil wash my hair. But it takes a heck load of shampoo to get the oil off!
1888 2018-10-27 18:57:34 Sir, first talk about Demonetization, oil prices, Rafeal deal , A.P special status... Then metoo for BJP...

1892 2018-10-27 18:57:19 What about sesame seed oil?
1893 2018-10-27 18:57:09 Na normal name. A kid I knew was named Olive Oil.
1894 2018-10-27 18:56:42 Stuck at Walmart for 3 hours for an oil change RIP
1895 2018-10-27 18:56:41 If Atiku's annual income is N20m: he bought PDP presidential forms for N20m; donated N10m to an amputee football team and N10m to Osisioma Oil pipeline explosion casualties. Are you sure he can manage Nigeria's economy, because he's expending more than his income?
1896 2018-10-27 18:56:37 Am going to give the Vit C and the rosehip oil a go! I’m all good for hyraulonic after panic buying the Ordinary after the news about them broke 
1897 2018-10-27 18:56:35 Good afternoon I fell in love with the guy that changed my dad’s car oil so yeah I’m having a pretty rough day
1898 2018-10-27 18:56:27 Would you please explain how your good and beloved Assad has won the war if the US is in control of oil, gas and water and free Syrians have more than 30% of the size of Syria (Idlib and so on). US won the war.
1899 2018-10-27 18:56:16 THE ENTIRE WEED INDUSTRY: were gonna use one kind of vape pen battery. even though represent thousands of companies, all weed oil pods will be compatible with it

APPLE: ooh sorry you’re gonna need 18 adapters for that thing you bought 2 months ago. we’re innovators
1900 2018-10-27 18:56:15 You think this guy has ever mowed a lawn, changed his oil, used a vacuum cleaner, fixed a screen door, cooked a meal, shoveled snow, raked leaves, fixed a leaking pipe? The idea he doesn’t understand umbrellas isn’t far fetched.
1901 2018-10-27 18:56:04 How about $6 Billion from UAE as funding also. $5 Billion in deposited and a billion in oil with deferred payments. 

And another $2.5 billion from China. 

ایسی ہی ایک خواب آیا تھا
1902 2018-10-27 18:56:01 Put it this way, @JamesMCuddy just recently posted BoC’s study where they didn’t even find correlation between oil price and migrations & RE prices in Alberta.

Not even saying that the whole NASDAQ may be collapsing right now so outlook for the tech sector is cloudy.
1903 2018-10-27 18:55:51 Given his track record of doing everything he says he will, why doubt him?
1904 2018-10-27 18:55:48 Which small? I’m talking equal share here
1905 2018-10-27 18:55:41 I let a girl borrow my hair oil and asked for it back and she said okay and then left for the weekend without giving it back to me. I’m not letting her borrow my shit ever again. Good job fucking up my kindness. You finna have dry ass hair now.

CJP visit diffrent places in Sind but he is not a fear 4 people now,as CJP was easily deceived in Alcohal ,Honey & olive oil case
CJP could not do any thing
If CJP could not prove than how FIA , NAB & Police could prove in Court
1909 2018-10-27 18:54:54 Fracking = seismic activity. That is its very essence. It releases the gas and oil. And none of us feel it, as it happens 3km below our feet, in a very controlled way. Its brilliant! The pinacle of our technological progress. Nice to see the transparency @CuadrillaUK apply!
1910 2018-10-27 18:54:50 coconut oil is a good one too
1911 2018-10-27 18:54:50 Jason, supposing for a moment I accept your premise that greedy oil companies will pass on the costs and the average price for gas goes up 15¢ per gallon. It’s a fair point, but an unbalanced equation. (1)
1912 2018-10-27 18:53:40 Got Peter’s (my car) oil changed and now he drives so smoothly  So nice. Also Ive had my car for more than 4 years and I havent even hit 40k miles yet. Dang.

1914 2018-10-27 18:53:36 Peppermint oil... on temples and forehead.
1915 2018-10-27 18:53:23 Why is tea tree oil so STRONG! I’m walkin round smellin like a pack of Kools 
1916 2018-10-27 18:53:22 Canada does not buy oil. Private companies that own private refineries purchase the oil from suppliers so that they can make profits. It's called free enterprise. Davis, are you implying you would like a national energy policy that makes oil companies purchase only CDN oil?
1917 2018-10-27 18:53:22 This is my favourite drugstore cleansing oil !!!! The only downside is kalau termasuk dalam mata memang kabur teruk. Selain tu, best. Kalau tak allergic dgn mana mana ingredients, I highly recommend you to try this one ! 
1918 2018-10-27 18:53:09 So far 42% of people are wrong. Why the fuck would anyone drink John Smiths?? I’d rather drink engine oil than that shite
1919 2018-10-27 18:53:05 More worried about @theresa_may and her friends in Saudi Arabia that can just literally cut someone up and UK continue to do arms deals but @ you think he’s dangerous? All those in power are dangerous bc they are in it for money, power, land and oil #justsaying
1920 2018-10-27 18:52:52 Eh we will compensate you small

1923 2018-10-27 18:52:37 I’m just gonna start budgeting $1000 every time I go to “just” get an oil change.
1924 2018-10-27 18:52:21 When he said he puts coconut oil in his hair, it brought me life!

1927 2018-10-27 18:51:19 y'know

i joke about being Every North African's Lost Cousin

but the fact that Tunisian olive oil is 

literally

the only thing i can put in my beard without breaking out has me thinking those cats at the halal store might be onto something
1928 2018-10-27 18:50:52 Not good. I knew Justin the pilot and he was being terribly burned by leaking engine oil, trapped upside down in his seat as that photo was taken. He required extensive skin grafts prior to committing suicide because of the consequent publicity, CAA court case etc
1929 2018-10-27 18:50:51 Oilers coming off a big win and fans back to bitching. Gotta love Oil country.
1930 2018-10-27 18:50:51 GM realizes that they (and the U.S.) can take the lead, or cede market dominance to China ("Jina") and others. Screw the orange s#¡tgibbon and big oil - we're moving forward!
1931 2018-10-27 18:50:51 I accidentally went 4000 miles over when I was suppose to get an oil change and my regular guys judged the shit out of me
1932 2018-10-27 18:50:50 Dumb ass oil changes dumb ass new tires dumb ass new breaks

1936 2018-10-27 18:50:19 'Oil is unhealthy' 
1937 2018-10-27 18:49:53 No, but new boiler was needed, and the damaged (pretty sure the fuel attendant stood on the pipe) oil tank was single skinned, so a double skin was bought. Water pipes need sorting too, always something needed doing. 
1938 2018-10-27 18:49:48 So fun fact: noodles and pasta are NOT the same thing. 

Noodles are usually made with flour, water, salt, and maybe an egg. 

Pasta is made semolina flour, water, olive oil, and maybe an egg depending on the type of pasta.
1939 2018-10-27 18:49:40 Coconut oil works too
1940 2018-10-27 18:49:29 put castor oil on them

1943 2018-10-27 18:49:10 Can i be honest? I really think i was suppose to be an R&B singer...but Im scared of that fame and lifestyle so I stick to the oil field 
1944 2018-10-27 18:49:09 Wine. And he said to them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages. One lamb of fine flour mingled with three measures of fine flour mingled with finely pure salt, and a fourth of a hin of beaten oil,

1946 2018-10-27 18:49:01 Rick Simpson Oil, Pheonix Tears, must be made properly with Indica bud & high THC. It cures pretty much everything. Also can watch recent SGT Report video "The Video They Don't Want You To See" with Kerri Rivera. I believe this may be the answer to your prayers. God bless. <3
1947 2018-10-27 18:48:50 olive oil talk - wicked !
1948 2018-10-27 18:48:49 Because oil is icky? Because Liberals envision a post-national state operating as a UN vassal? Insanity? Peer pressure? I’m truly asking!
1949 2018-10-27 18:48:48 Because some people use hyperbole like ‘you don’t need to know anything in the age of Google’ to sell Google shares. And some people latch onto that to sell educational snake oil.
1950 2018-10-27 18:48:47 Hellllooooooo!! I am looking for dry fall skin remedies! I already use lotion twice a day and I use rosehip oil at night as well, but nothing seems to work!! Any recommendations would be very appreciated :-)
1951 2018-10-27 18:48:28 Thanks! I hope we can connect our classes in the spring. I can’t wait to see what our kids create during the Oil STEM challenge.
1952 2018-10-27 18:48:21 Just gone and ordered myself some CBD Oil!
1953 2018-10-27 18:48:17 Go oil your gun.  Be safe.

#moneyhoney
1960 2018-10-27 18:46:47 The only caveat @SPhillipsAB would probably add to that is, "aligned with the forward thinking companies, like the oil sands producers." And @RachelNotley told me that for her it's about protecting good paying jobs. Those observations are based upon on the record interviews.

1964 2018-10-27 18:46:31 Most people follow goose-step with what their political leaders decry in public and social media, irrespective of fact. It's easier to not educate yourselves. Oil gags just about EVERY politician with any kind of agenda. Leadership says nothing so the willfully ignorant look away
1965 2018-10-27 18:46:26 Is there a place to buy cbd oil close to LSU? I’d love to not have to take Xanax daily and it really works for me.

1971 2018-10-27 18:45:52 I came to get an oil change and suddenly I need a new battery, new air filter, and I have a nail in my tire.  If y’all muh fucahs don’t just do my oil change and give me my car back.
1972 2018-10-27 18:45:31 That's the real issues, to be happy spending money we don't have, Nigeria is a dumping ground for fake goods and expired drugs, we produce nothing, erratic power failures, technologically backwards, thousands barrels of oil stolen every day by foreigners and you want to be happy
1973 2018-10-27 18:45:19 Being so short that hot oil burns you on your eye lid 
1974 2018-10-27 18:45:16 oil is literally moisturizing water
1975 2018-10-27 18:44:42 You of all people know you don’t want us to follow the money. @NRA, Big Oil, tons of PAC money from out of state. No wonder you don’t support common sense gun reform, a healthy planet, public schools. You are beholden to so many special interests.

1978 2018-10-27 18:44:12 How would license raj lobby prevent bankruptcy? Did they have the dollars to buy oil? Think through before tweeting.
1979 2018-10-27 18:44:09 I'm in Florida which is humid and quite rainy at times. I use Tri-flow oil, which works fine, but it's messy. I may try a wax in the future.

1983 2018-10-27 18:43:27 I've used tea tree oil for scar prevention. The regular one that a lot of people use is evening primrose oil.

I can't do lavender.

1985 2018-10-27 18:43:00 Iwe kurigger kwamakaita kwakavharisa maindustry no oil no bread...this is embarassing prices going up every day 2% tax for every dollar on helpless citizens.  I like it teach your followers a lesson. Wen mdca takes over we will clean your mess cde.
1986 2018-10-27 18:42:47 Quality dog food is key w/ emphasis on protein. They get egg & olive oil on theirs, too, & love it though when the restocking oops occurs. Then they get chicken, veggies, rice (green beans, carrots, sweet potatoes). Damn near jump on the cook top while salivating/ begging..
1987 2018-10-27 18:42:45 Well said Anne. I am both numb and angry, angry that we have snake oil salesman pretending to be POTUS and he continues to push his hateful rhetoric everyday, and numb in listening to all of his supporters who are blind to the hate-filled shit he is feeding them each day. RESIST!

1989 2018-10-27 18:42:37 The first things had to occur in order for the last things to take place. For instance, our ability to keep warm from fossil fuels such as coal and oil made from the fossils of extinct things. It was a well ordered plan.

1991 2018-10-27 18:41:57 If a woman asks for some of your eucalyptus oil at the gym, is she hitting on you, or is she just being entrepreneurial?
1992 2018-10-27 18:41:52 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
1993 2018-10-27 18:41:52 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1994 2018-10-27 18:41:50 I know I’m late but...Jamaican Castor oil and tea tree oil are LIFE SAVERS.
1995 2018-10-27 18:41:41 That's nice but... where's my olive oil?
1996 2018-10-27 18:41:33 Makes them pretty useless when you really need them.
Dems claim to be for border security, law/order, safety and security.
Yet they back every idea BUT the most effective ways to accomplish what they claim to be for. Person has to conclude they are just lying

2022 2018-10-27 18:38:25 Exactly, bina baat ki masala de diya opposition ko majje lene ke liye.  On a serious note seems like, S-400 deal nd continuation of oil from IRAN made US to made dis decision
2023 2018-10-27 18:38:21 I don’t leave them in for an extensive time with one set . When I shower I let it down and let it take in the steam & castor oil with tea tree on your scalp daily. Basically care for your scalp lol it’s really dry in AZ
2024 2018-10-27 18:38:17 I’m trynna find somebody to change my oil and check my tires, everybody i know to go to gotta long ass waiting time . Have you ever been to Speedee ?
2025 2018-10-27 18:37:36 5)The US is becoming more energy Independent, but is still highly reliant upon a great deal of foreign oil. This makes the US very reliant on the Middle East.
2026 2018-10-27 18:37:35 I am deeply saddened by the Trump administration's decision to disregard the plan to support clean, renewable energy and relieve our dependency on foreign oil
2027 2018-10-27 18:37:34 Seems like there will be no trouble with the mayor and his truffle oil now.

(I know they're not truffles but they're mushrooms too shush guys XD)
2028 2018-10-27 18:37:33 Thanks! Final buff on the shellac finish, and oil treatment for the bridge and fretboard. It gets a coat of wax tomorrow, then the strings finally go back on.
2029 2018-10-27 18:37:19 @KatRamsland oil business left him by his father, Fred, into a $115 billionempire. What changed things for him, Koch says, was a 1995 Texas case against Koch Industries. As Koch tells it, state prosecutors pressured a Koch employee he had fired into testifying in a criminal case

2031 2018-10-27 18:37:09 The oil industry saved the whales
2032 2018-10-27 18:37:07 "more than 12.8 million acres of federally controlled oil and gas parcels were offered for lease in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30..."  That is a staggering number!!  There will be nothing natural left at that rate!  Oh help!
2033 2018-10-27 18:37:06 I am a robot. I piss oil
2034 2018-10-27 18:37:02 Good, they have been playing slapshot for far too long, and behave a lot like snake oil salesmen.

2038 2018-10-27 18:36:34 TO REMOVE WHITE SPOTS FROM FURNITURE, rub first with oil, and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole.
2039 2018-10-27 18:36:23 Got my baby oil changed she moving better she breathing different 
2040 2018-10-27 18:36:23 @rhettandlink @rhettmc - Do you have a sample bottle of the Beard Oil or something? I would love to try it, but not sure if i will like it or not and don't want to really spend the $16 if i don't like it.
2041 2018-10-27 18:36:07 Criminals are going too far when they rub their bodies with oil and shed their clothes while running away from the scene of the crime. Thus, the need for tasers, batons, lasers and guns.
2042 2018-10-27 18:36:06 Correction in this tweet I never said Engine oil I have no idea where that came from somebody’s doing something on this Twitter because I am your support I just know it to make me look like a fool but I am a very smart woman I speak into my phoneit always adds words.”I NEVER SAID
2043 2018-10-27 18:36:03 German pizza.  Ingredients: salt, and oil.
2044 2018-10-27 18:35:51 We expect consequences for admitted ISIS supporters & sympathizers on our streets, and not rewards! Your nonsense has no impact on Saudi Arabia as we still buy their filthy oil!
2045 2018-10-27 18:35:45 Their descent grom the US paper of record to whatever they can be called now has been sad to watch
2046 2018-10-27 18:35:44 
2047 2018-10-27 18:35:37 Yes, olive oil. Sometimes I start with some methylated spirits to wet it and then olive oil.
2048 2018-10-27 18:35:32 Can solve any problem with either amaretto or olive oil 
2049 2018-10-27 18:35:30 CHECK YOUR OIL DUMB BITCHHHH
2050 2018-10-27 18:35:24 As for ethical oil, most of our oil industry is foreign owned and very little is ethical oil.
2051 2018-10-27 18:35:24 A trick many people may not know about. I cut my finger a while ago & now it's forming INCREDIBLY ITCHY scar tissue.

If you oil it w/a heavy oil like olive or shea butter it'll soften the scar & ease the itchy. Add a bit of lavender essential oil if you want, it helps healing.
2052 2018-10-27 18:35:23 It is 2018. Hasan is our king, the use of coconut oil is widespread, Priyanka is marrying Nick, and my relatives in India STILL feel the need to tell me what I can and cannot post on social media re: Halloween costumes
2053 2018-10-27 18:35:21 no blow jobs here just lube and oil!
2054 2018-10-27 18:35:13 Honest question here. Cancelling the sale would have a huge financial impact on Canadians and no impact on Saudi Arabia. They’ll just buy elsewhere. Wouldn’t it be better to stop the cash flow in the other direction? Stop buying their oil.
2055 2018-10-27 18:35:11 I tried out an old Manhattan long lasting red lip tint I found again today and I can't get it off with any make up remover. I tried everything, from oil to shaving cream to vaseline to get the swatch off of my hand but it stays on like a tatoo
2056 2018-10-27 18:35:09 Wish I had my Kwaka now John, I bet you the same, with the oil leak if you was blessed with one !
2057 2018-10-27 18:35:06 I don’t see how people aren’t switching to electric cars , @Tesla  made the Model 3 affordable af...the thought of not having to deal with GAS and oil changes anymore 
2058 2018-10-27 18:35:00 I tried making popcorn with coconut oil and it worked out but, these babies are dry 
2059 2018-10-27 18:34:58 “Trumps making gas prices too expensive!”

Tries to end dependency on foreign oil. 

“Trump is a terrorist!”
2060 2018-10-27 18:34:33 Hopefully the trip up and home was a bit better

2062 2018-10-27 18:34:18 Here's the answer;NRA is a Koch operation;Kochs own the biggest fossil fuel company in the nation,inherited it from their dad who worked for Stalin&Hitler drilling oil;he hates Democracy&so do his sons;they use their $ to own GOP congress&all deny climate change&support guns
2063 2018-10-27 18:34:04 Negligible, oil has risen exponentially, I'll spare you the face palm.
2064 2018-10-27 18:34:03 Such a great feeling when a good looking styles and applies @GIBSGrooming oil to your beard. #beard #beardlife
2065 2018-10-27 18:33:44 Olive oil doesn't fix every ailment.
2066 2018-10-27 18:33:38 Lead them from temptation, make them royalty. All the things we're facin' makes us question it. Lead us to salvation, pour that oil please
That's how we become kings and

2069 2018-10-27 18:33:03 Al Saud is just another desert tribe really, not a monarchy.
They literally slaughtered most of the other competing tribes, seizing control of the entire desert, and got luck very quickly thereafter when oil was discovered.
2070 2018-10-27 18:33:02 Does olive oil kill the bacteria though ?
2071 2018-10-27 18:32:31 This is why I don’t like to come and get my oil change by myself lol
2072 2018-10-27 18:32:13 Coal+oil plant burning oil into steam to make electricity is more miles than then processing oil into diesel, transporting the diesel to the pump/bus depot, and then burning the diesel in the bus.
2073 2018-10-27 18:31:40 Yes! Peppermint oil works amazingly!!! I use it when I get bad headaches as well. I never thought it would help but I was wrong. I hope this helped.
2074 2018-10-27 18:31:35 I will!!  when your boy is responsible for three goals against tonight… As usual
2075 2018-10-27 18:31:13 Revoked or not, that's what we the minorities in the northern part of Nigeria are experiencing daily. So don't coin it to oil well license revocation, cos he has other oil license at large. His country home is been occupied by fulanis jihadists courtesy PMB and back by military.
2076 2018-10-27 18:31:05 The government of Ghana has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Miley Cyrus in a cretonne wig.
2077 2018-10-27 18:30:57 This Quiet Oil Spill May Become Biggest Ever in US. What govt. official
is getting paid off to keep it low-keyed? Bring him/her up on criminal
charges for destroying ocean inhabitants.
2078 2018-10-27 18:30:55 Js got my oil changed. 
2079 2018-10-27 18:30:54 Oil is purchased in $ and € so of course part of it is due to the fall of the pound

2081 2018-10-27 18:29:38 I’ll give you my formula. Tea tree, eucalyptus, mint oil, castor oil, coconut oil and original eembeke oil. Mix them (in fair amount in a ka mid size bottle) and use as hair oil. You’ll have to start protective styles and invest in hair products.
2082 2018-10-27 18:29:37 I use coconut oil

sometimes mix it with
Aveeno lotion to

2086 2018-10-27 18:29:14 Like I said, inflation is at levels seen before the referendum, was Brexit to blame for those too?
You can't "cherry pick" pieces of data to conveniently slot into your narrative.
Oil has risen since Brexit, a factor which pushes inflation, are we to apportion that to Brexit?
2087 2018-10-27 18:28:59 Isaac success scored fr Watford in the evening
2088 2018-10-27 18:28:41 Watch them... Like a hawk. Lots of bloat around this Autumn. Like Fergal said a bottle cooking oil in the water seems to help. It's a build up of foamy gas in them and the oil helps it separate.
2089 2018-10-27 18:28:29 Oil change & wash day

2103 2018-10-27 18:26:19 Says something about the border mainly those living nowhere close to it claim is so secure.
This invasion force is filled with deportees that have every confidence in entering illegally. 
It's not that hard to do, just need toll money.
2104 2018-10-27 18:26:17 Boutt put a hot oil treatment in my hair 
2105 2018-10-27 18:26:14 I use coconut oil as a moisture and sometimes mix it with
Aveeno lotion to help my skin be soft
2106 2018-10-27 18:25:20 You could say so and in the same way overhead lines are not Scania’s problem. It belongs to the national road administration or whoever owns the road. We prepare for all options. And I hope we can agree that the primary goal is to replace fossil oil and gas.
2107 2018-10-27 18:25:20 Dab oil
2108 2018-10-27 18:25:17 so i just put helllla coconut oil in my hair with this hair masque, i hope all of it comes out 
2109 2018-10-27 18:25:16 If I went by the milage I'd be getting an oil change every month.
2110 2018-10-27 18:25:06 I say i'm an adult but i'm actually just a dum dum who never wears shoes and doesn't get an oil change until her mom says her car is about to explode

2122 2018-10-27 18:23:54 Leases take a very long time to develop. Isn’t this just a response to oil/gas prices on existing fields?
2123 2018-10-27 18:23:48 Good points. The problem as is often the case, is at the margins meaning that when combined with our other problems such as that it takes 12 years from discovery to production, any additional burden may be sufficient to push the oil companies out /2
2124 2018-10-27 18:23:46 There “may”.... you still be sick tho don’t you? I support oils but you put yo whole faith in the oil. Lol
2125 2018-10-27 18:23:43 Life itself, worth far more than oil and gas will ever be.
2126 2018-10-27 18:23:41 I made boxed red velvet cake. Not sure if I liked it XD maybe the oil was too much for me
2127 2018-10-27 18:23:34 Sunday: 
Different dipsticks, same oil.
2128 2018-10-27 18:23:22 Fashola is saying the obvious truths, the PDP destroyed our economy and squandered  our oil money for 16years that they were in Government, in a more decent society that enforces the rules of laws majority of PDP and APC leaders and members should be languishing in jails.
2129 2018-10-27 18:22:55 Yes, I’m going to cry as well… But for completely different reasons.. lol
2130 2018-10-27 18:22:50 Since we get ~33% of our oil from the ME, good luck with that.
2131 2018-10-27 18:22:34 Last night I was smoking gas, got my gas on 93 supreme
Smoking gas, drinking oil, no kerosene
2132 2018-10-27 18:22:25 Stupid-ass Tweaker Tammy. She acts like every strung-out white girl ever (who are often breathtakingly, inexplicably racist) and even has the gaunt tweaker face. Search her purse and I GUARAN-FUCKING-TEE you find at least a glass oil burnerand probably a bunch of other shit.

2153 2018-10-27 18:18:07 Aside from hydration and peppermint oil, there's also a pressure point between the thumb and index finger (right in the web) that holding pressure on REALLY helps to get rid of a headache. Good luck, and feel better soon!
2154 2018-10-27 18:17:58 It all depends on your type of skin, I have dry skin and I use the photo finish oil primer from smashbox and the urban decay setting spray
2155 2018-10-27 18:17:48 Aww, so Orange and Saffron are in the middle of a fight? I'd thought birds of a feather flock together, or has the belated decision by India to not kowtow to the US (as was Dr Singh's policy) by not stopping oil purchases from Iran and buying S-400 missile defence system.
2156 2018-10-27 18:17:41 Once the rich became richer than states they pretty much took over conservative parties throughout western world. Canada’s right has been an arm of the oil industry for twenty years.

2165 2018-10-27 18:16:09 If you’re from Alabama, Canada or Australia and you’re looking for some CBD oil, I’m your girl! 
Hit me up! 

2166 2018-10-27 18:16:05 Warning: don’t get oil changes at Walmart, they’ll fuck up your car
2167 2018-10-27 18:16:00 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
2168 2018-10-27 18:15:46 Bio oil untuk ngilangin stretch marks bukannya?
2169 2018-10-27 18:15:25 It’s not a low fat diet that is successful, it’s eradicating all animal products and especially animal fats. Effectively living Vegan but nothing using coconut oil.
2170 2018-10-27 18:15:20 !!! Was it worth it? As good as you expected (you know, since it wasn’t fresh from the cheese factory and olive oil press)?
2171 2018-10-27 18:15:06 Going to research Vayu winter foods and be done with it. Thinking, lots of potato, surprisingly this last round of rice didn't give me many issues so many more there. And might start incorporating oil again tbh. Potato/Rice base with spices and veggies.
2172 2018-10-27 18:15:06 someone come take my car to get a oil change  I got the money !!!
2173 2018-10-27 18:14:51 Plastic is a product of Big Oil which obstructs any efforts to halt its massive pollution.
2174 2018-10-27 18:14:27 Except Exxon didn’t invent oil
2175 2018-10-27 18:14:24 The context was talking standards, privacy, benefit sharing, evaluating value/pricing. OPEC comes up b/c "data is the new oil". What happens when there are few major producers/suppliers, etc.
2176 2018-10-27 18:14:19 Must be oil & vinegar on his arm (From the Subway Sandwich of course).
2177 2018-10-27 18:14:09 I don't hate anyone.  I just understand that oil and water don't mix.  I love to hear Miranda and Blake together.  That's some good music written by them and the voices blend so perfectly.  They could have owned Country Music with their collaborated talent.  #Nohate
2178 2018-10-27 18:14:00 Unfortunately they're kinda good.  Too much to ask for the stupid ass Oil
2179 2018-10-27 18:13:54 Anyone Ever Tried That Olive Oil & Egg Shit In Ur Hair 
2180 2018-10-27 18:13:46 olive oil        fortnite players

2182 2018-10-27 18:13:39 Engga ngefek apa2 di aku kalo yg baby oil kalo bio oil mungkin bisa buat maskara?-_-
2183 2018-10-27 18:13:19 gue pernah baca2 ktnya pake baby oil bisa...
2184 2018-10-27 18:13:00 ごま油、タンスの角に指ぶつけろ。
2185 2018-10-27 18:12:59 Thorium Nuclear reactors to replace oil and gas and accelerate decarbonization.  One for each major city to power our drive to electrify homes and vehicles
2186 2018-10-27 18:12:52 He knows...  I just had to rub him with coconut oil. He has OCD so everyday at this time. Can’t you let mommy get rid of her headache. Nope. Dino wins 
2187 2018-10-27 18:12:45 That won't work bcz people who can afford to pay higher prices don't care and will continue to use. Those that can't afford not to use bcz of work will have less and less till on the street. Do U really think Oil Magnates will help & cut their profits? I don't think so.
2188 2018-10-27 18:12:44 Shatterday 10% off a gram of oil, 20% off 4 grams or more up to 5 g. lots of exciting deals in store to please U & UR pocket book
2189 2018-10-27 18:12:30 One patient I know is getting relief from high doses of CBD oil.
2190 2018-10-27 18:12:29 Baby oil jgn dipakein ke seluruh muka tp. Dia clogged pores
2191 2018-10-27 18:12:26 I’m tryna have a boyfriend like y’all that wash and vacuum your car & change your oil 
2192 2018-10-27 18:12:21 What kind of issues #Iran and #Isreal can discuss? Iranian mulls are using #isreal as reason to kill #syrian, control #lebanon, support #hamas & build nuclear bombs. I do not think they ll discuss oil or Yemen. If #Oman can convince Iran to leave #Syria that ll be great.
2193 2018-10-27 18:12:04 Tapi bio oil sayang kali,  baby oil aja
2194 2018-10-27 18:11:54 Which oil have you been using? There are a lot of different CBD oil on the market. A lot of them are not the same quality.
2195 2018-10-27 18:11:45 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
2196 2018-10-27 18:11:40 Its where "Islamic" charity $$ gets recycled into legal action against Western resistance, perpetually pursuing an Islamic agenda. Saudi Arabia funds this also via filthy oil wealth. Using our own system against us as our leaders & judiciary fold under the economic pressure.
2197 2018-10-27 18:11:36 There are limits to what America must feel is behaviour that allows them to stand beside a nation even if they’re a powerful oil producer, there has to be or the values of liberty and freedom begin to mean nothing and are worthless @realDonaldTrump @SenBobCorker
2198 2018-10-27 18:11:36 Trump, Rush, Hannity, Alex Jones, and all the rest of the conspiracy theory snake oil salesmen have blood on their hands. 

And the GOP stays silent.

We need to VOTE these people out and put this beautiful country back on track.
2199 2018-10-27 18:11:26 Try lavender oil put a dab on your finger and pat on the eyes at night. Or put a drop in your liquid eyeliner or mascara in a week you will see them grow..
2200 2018-10-27 18:11:17 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump - We KNOW they're after us! As Domestic Resource Providers, these evil beings have been attacking us since the ESA in `73. Why? Because we have the land, water, gas, oil and mineral rights they want! Control the food, control the people.
2201 2018-10-27 18:11:11 any idiot knows if you add oil into a flame, it will fucking turn into a bonfire.
2202 2018-10-27 18:10:53 Okay lets agrue facts, did the previous administration save cash while oil was above $100 ?
2203 2018-10-27 18:10:46 Bitch I damnea fucked my fender up off this oil last night 
2204 2018-10-27 18:10:35 You're welcome! One guy I spoke with at the gas station slammed his car door in my face. There's too many oil field workers out here.
2205 2018-10-27 18:10:32 That looks good. I would probably simply chop it up - season and pan fry with the onion in olive oil or dripping. Add the rosemary and a splash of wine later for a sauce.
2206 2018-10-27 18:10:20 あいて…ちょっとエルザにスリーサイズ聞いただけなのに殴られた…
2207 2018-10-27 18:10:12 You're the crudest oil, let your vision boil, yeah they're gonna dig a coal-face!
Out of you.
Isambard, I'm all steel!
2208 2018-10-27 18:10:11 So I bought a @Groupon for an oil change at Valvoline...to bad Valvoline doesn’t accept groupons....how are you allowed to sell something that the business doesn’t use..
2209 2018-10-27 18:10:03 二重顎っていうか逆に顎がないよ。
2210 2018-10-27 18:09:54 Very... simple... hey, how about to add some native olive oil, dried tomatoes, black olives, garlic, parsley, pepper,salt? And a glass of Vinalba Malbec Bonarda 2016?
2211 2018-10-27 18:09:41 Wish I had a man that would take my car to get a smog and change the oil 
2212 2018-10-27 18:09:37 Honey turkey, salami, pepper jack, lettuce, tomato, extra mayo, honey mustard, oil & vinegar & black pepper - tell em put the meats and cheese on the grill .
2213 2018-10-27 18:09:36 Nope! But this refinery will change the future of Karak! We are producing 40k barrel crude oil daily & constructing it in Kk will save millions for Govt. Again,future in the hands of our elected members Mian Nisar, MLK Zafar Azam & MNA @Shahidkhattak0 to help getting locals jobs
2214 2018-10-27 18:09:34 oh..but I don’t use Nthn on my hair when flat ironing it but coconut oil
2215 2018-10-27 18:09:32 *slurping oil out of my Togo box* “oooo this rice juice is good”
2216 2018-10-27 18:09:28 the drug store stuff: biore pore cleanser, vitamin E cream, rosehip oil, micellar water and then for body- palmers cocoa butter + bio oil
2217 2018-10-27 18:09:05 Smoother than a snake oil salesmen with words equally disingenuous
2218 2018-10-27 18:09:03 Your Trackers will be “Going hard in the Mac” as they take on the Oil Barons in a double header weekend.
2219 2018-10-27 18:08:46 Yup. You should see the VP motorcade as it drives away from Lucas Oil. Oh, we already did. Lots of $ that we paid for that.
2220 2018-10-27 18:08:39 Hungry, tired! I enter kitchen; light gas; pour oil inside pot; add ground pepper, salt, Maggi, pour water, and rice.

Dinner will soon be ready. 
2221 2018-10-27 18:08:33 Americans would do it if the bucket had oil in it
2222 2018-10-27 18:08:33 I'm guessing that there is an oil painting in Moira Stuart's attic that is showing age?

2223 2018-10-27 18:08:32 Soak with vegetable oil and keep rubbing with dry paper towels. Add oil as you go along. It will leave no marks. Works brilliantly on all plastic as well.
2224 2018-10-27 18:08:22 I'm getting my oil changed at one of those drive through places. Interestingly, all the employees are women.  Impressive.
2225 2018-10-27 18:08:19 2nd half was a bit disappointing. But that’s the Raith way 
2226 2018-10-27 18:08:13 (1)s400 from russia (2)oil purchase from Iran
2227 2018-10-27 18:08:00 Ok, I give on the Afghanistan point. 9/11 Truther? I don’t think so but the Iraq mess started after that tragedy and featured “sexed up”  intelligence, a phony Niger yellow cake story, withdrawal from Afghanistan with OBL almost captured, and Operation Iraqi Liberty (OIL), right?
2228 2018-10-27 18:07:48 So Indomie Relish is indomie, palm oil & grinded pepper? 

Guys, admire the package design and move on.
2229 2018-10-27 18:07:41 That's perhaps why I don't eat out, fast food Is disgusting,  and so are a lot of chain restaurants. For instance,  I went to an O'Charleys one day and overheard the chef saying to a customer, "all we use is soybean oil", that's highly estrogenic and disgusting
2230 2018-10-27 18:07:41 It’s precisely ordinary families who won’t be in debt. My understanding is that average families will get more back than they see their bills increase, so “catching up” won’t be the issue. Families s that are bigger than average consumers of oil and gas will feel more of a pinch.
2231 2018-10-27 18:07:36 this shit better drive like a god damn mclaren and get my stupid ass to the moon for $60 a fucking oil change jesus christ
2232 2018-10-27 18:07:35 My 3 in 1 vape came!
Dabs, herbs, or oils 

Mainly oil use this way 
2233 2018-10-27 18:07:32 le gaz oil a 2 € le litre signifiera la fin de l'égalité républicaine pour les  gaulois  qui se levent tôt pour aller au taf
on est loin des clichés  et des boutades mais par contre la sanction fiscale ressentie est elle bien réelle et ne fait rire personne
2234 2018-10-27 18:07:31 Don’t live in Alaska but did a great job opening the oil.
2235 2018-10-27 18:07:09 K sir, like I said , life no be war.
Bye
2236 2018-10-27 18:07:07 Hahaha. No. It was during the 17th inning last night. Legit willpower!

2238 2018-10-27 18:06:46 always remember to put skin conditioning oil on after shaving
2239 2018-10-27 18:06:42 Trying to be productive by getting my oil change and other noticeable problems about the car. Here we go. 
2240 2018-10-27 18:06:29 - Heat oil in pan 
- Flake chicken and put in pan with the sweet corn
- Cook for a minute or two then add boiling water (whoops forgot to put that in ingredients)
- Crumble stock cube in
- Break pasta up into bits and put into pot.
- Cook for 10 mins

2241 2018-10-27 18:06:02 India already showed that by refusing to entertain US diktat on S400 and Iranian oil. This is a sad news for Indian Trumpists still

2243 2018-10-27 18:05:51 Not a lie at all. Any revenues for energy green or not go towards funding for schools. This leads to up 400$ extra in energy costs on top of rent. So go green the price kW is is a major difference between oil & eco and the brainwashing pushes it so it can make more from taxes.

2246 2018-10-27 18:05:37 Yesterday I got my tires aired up, oil changed, vacuumed car, and a full tank of gas. I feel like a whole new woman.
2247 2018-10-27 18:05:32 Ima use baby oil forever
2248 2018-10-27 18:05:22 ขอบคุณค่ะ
2249 2018-10-27 18:05:09 It's not blown, mech says it's a possible leak, oil was fine coming out and tested going in.

They wouldn't work on it if it wasn't worth it.
2250 2018-10-27 18:04:49 You could stop an oil leak with a KFC biscuit
2251 2018-10-27 18:04:32 castor oil will help them so much just wash it off in the morning thats all
2252 2018-10-27 18:04:24 He would rather protect a measly military contact than jeopardize getting Oil from a bunch of Murderous Butchers.... from Saudi Arabia.
2253 2018-10-27 18:04:06 もっとウェイ学生みたいな服がいる
2254 2018-10-27 18:03:53 If you can put castor oil on your eye lashes without having trouble seeing or running em under water for 10 minutes you a fuckin legend.
2255 2018-10-27 18:03:44 I’m looking for a big wooden old fashioned painting easel. Also brushes. Also oil paint.
2256 2018-10-27 18:03:26 Yesss he best thing to do!! I use to wear lash extensions a long time ago and they brought my real lashes out sooooo bad they were bold I use to cry. But now I use oil on them every single day and my shit hella long 
2257 2018-10-27 18:03:23 @ZellnerLaw assuming you get the evidentiary hearing and Avery gets a new trial; are those who suppressed evidence that falls into Brady violations subject to criminal or ethical violations?
2258 2018-10-27 18:03:12 Castor oil makes your lashes grow !!! Wow I want mines to grow
2259 2018-10-27 18:03:04 Kids stole the rest?
2260 2018-10-27 18:03:03 Oil change
2261 2018-10-27 18:03:02 exactly he's literally adding oil to the fire. i cannot fucking believe it he has the maturity of a 6-year old
2262 2018-10-27 18:03:00 Looks more like condensation from the air conditioner. Oil tends to be darker.
2263 2018-10-27 18:03:00 Oooo...blown head gasket is an engine death sentence. If your engine oil looks like chocolate milk it's already too late. I wouldn't bother with the brake work.
2264 2018-10-27 18:02:59 In @TheSundayIndo business pages I have an exclusive interview with Kerryman Bernard Looney, who has been tipped for the top job at oil giant BP, where he’s currently CEO of its Upstream division, with 18,000 staff & in charge of finding oil & gas
2265 2018-10-27 18:02:50 Pro tip: act dumb stupid at the oil change place and the guy will give you a $30 discount
2266 2018-10-27 18:02:49 The best feeling ever is when your mum massages your head with oil
2267 2018-10-27 18:02:49 Lol Oga sorry ooo life no be war
2268 2018-10-27 18:02:45 Car makers/oil companies will do anything to push Tesla out.
2269 2018-10-27 18:02:35 @realDonaldTrump Now, the goal is to sanction oil and swift, if you retreat, it's all about you, but if you do all the sanctions without breach, you will surely win. Retreat means end
2270 2018-10-27 18:02:17 My dog had alopecia with patches of hair that  fell out. After she started  CBD oil her hair grew back. It's very good for autoimmune issues
2271 2018-10-27 18:02:07 i hate getting oil changes! sometimes i hate that i have a car
2272 2018-10-27 18:02:04 I'm pretty much a migraine Pro. I have chronic migraines. Magnesium can cause stomach upset, if possible eat foods rich in magnesium rather than taking a supplement. In the meantime peppermint, lavender, tea tree oil, eucalyptus or Menthol will help alleviate some the pain.
2273 2018-10-27 18:01:48 I need to go get a oil change real quick
2274 2018-10-27 18:01:47 think imma take a break from lash extensions, put some castor oil on my own to grow out more.
2275 2018-10-27 18:01:47 楽しみにしときやすw
2276 2018-10-27 18:01:42 Lavender and peppermint oil on your forehead and back of your neck. Warm towel. Dark room.
2277 2018-10-27 18:01:18 Was Brutus The Fucking Barber beefcake at this show to Oil Up Hulk Hogan's Monster Truck arms or what brother
2278 2018-10-27 18:01:14 sigh....strange energies from space dudes. Cosmic rays are up over 18% since 2003. Other HEP (high energy particles) are up (aggregated) over 80% just since 2011. Human brain is emulsified oil antenna (basically). So no wonder. Get used to it. Peak incoming not until 2058
2279 2018-10-27 18:01:04 In capitalist USA, the ones who rule are the economic power elites and those politicians who get on their knees to suck up to those who own the resources, the banks, the oil, the big pharma, and so on.  There's your freedom.  U only have the freedom to ratify what the elites say.
2280 2018-10-27 18:01:00 ふぉろわーがみんなカスタムキャストやってる！！！！やりたくなっちゃう！！！！スマホの要領不足！！！！ちくしょう！！！！
2281 2018-10-27 18:00:41 I spilled some of the peppermint oil I bought on the #guillotinequeens retreat and now my house smells like a candy cane and it’s entirely too soon for that.
2282 2018-10-27 18:00:39 We don’t and won’t rely on the NS oil! We have so much going for us. We are a very rich country. We are WasteMonsters cash cow. Please, please do the homework
2283 2018-10-27 18:00:38 Olive oil, onions, garlic, a whole jalapeño, salt, pepper, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, 3 chicken breasts, lemon, lime, little cilantro, a block of cream cheese, and whatever you have in the fridge that’s fixin to go bad.
2284 2018-10-27 18:00:31 @JoeNBC @brianstelter This is evidence of “Enemy of the People”
2285 2018-10-27 18:00:23 No in Meaures G. Uh, oil pays schools and green energy is too damn expensive and costs renters up 400 extra. Oil is king .005 kW things like wind 1.5 kW are expensive and sufficiently kill birds. California is costly due to policy and hippyism.
2286 2018-10-27 18:00:08 My greatest achievement of the last 10 years... opening a box of those charity almond chocolates and only eating 2. TWO!
2287 2018-10-27 18:00:05  Today #wti #crude #oil price: 
67.62 $
59.49 €
 #petro #elpetro #ptr
2288 2018-10-27 17:59:53 So you are upping the price of arms trade to #SaudiArabia 

when all they need to do is up the price of oil to offset the difference?

You weasel Russian money taker!!
2289 2018-10-27 17:59:48 Fffffff okok I won’t pop it  I’ll leave it be and get some type of cleaning oil 
2290 2018-10-27 17:59:44 And yuh cant even say lemme find ah man in oil and gas 
2291 2018-10-27 17:59:39 Cooking oil is salad ? , now I know what to say when I'm in Zambia.
2292 2018-10-27 17:59:30 If you ask me, na who I go ask? 
2293 2018-10-27 17:59:28 Marinated in Achar Masala, mixed in lime juice and olive oil.
Baked for 40 minutes at 200°C, tray covered by aluminium foil.
Then, another 20 minutes with the foil removed.
Check if more time needed depending on how well done you like the meat.
Apply generous amount of butter.
2294 2018-10-27 17:59:26 The sea is clear and amazing shades of blue. Some active oil and natural gas wells are found in low numbers.
2295 2018-10-27 17:58:56 Agreed. But they impact oil price.
2296 2018-10-27 17:58:48 Trump has been in power 2 years, tell how he's draining or drained the swamp?

You guys were blaming Obama and wanting him dive down into the Gulf of Mexico and fix the Deepwater Horizon oil spill himself in a month but Trump has had 2yrs and you guys are soooooooo patient.
2297 2018-10-27 17:58:47 Donations don't affect 3 letter agencies much short term. Trump's oil industry preference and anti environment attitude doesn't help Tesla there at all
2298 2018-10-27 17:58:31 Harper and Mulroney, Conservative PM’s didn’t sell arms and buy SA oil?
2299 2018-10-27 17:58:31 can you explain the geography of how the Lyari drain would carry oil to Mubarak village?
2300 2018-10-27 17:58:30 Au contraire.   Everyone has an agenda in oil.
2301 2018-10-27 17:58:29 Sent me off on a tangent of all I never wanted to know about poke salad. An online recipe search leads almost exclusively to raw seafood macerated in sesame oil, soy sauce, & Asian style spices & where it's pronounced POH-kay.
2302 2018-10-27 17:58:27 I also take vitamin D, magnesium, fish oil - these are in tablet/capsule  form.
2303 2018-10-27 17:58:15 Don’t make fried eggs with coconut oil
2304 2018-10-27 17:58:10 Coming into the dealership for an oil change and they have a million other things that gotta be done. Take all my money, it’s fine
2305 2018-10-27 17:58:06 and wetin concern you for our talk. Abeg gerrout of here
2306 2018-10-27 17:58:00 RT @Lav202016V2: For 2000 years, mankind has used pres. to extract vegetable oil. It turns out that nature has its own "pres." - the effect of "fatal pressure." The discovered effect became the basis of 4marvel technology: produces natural cosmetics,health food and even dete…
2307 2018-10-27 17:57:59 Robust economy means handing over depleted national reserve frm over $60b to paltry $26b, when states were unable to pay salaries, when gains of oil boom are diverted to private pocket & import of virtually  luxury item, commission of projects on papers etc. Is that what u mean
2308 2018-10-27 17:57:52 My only answer is that there must be a side deal between the this Bank CEO and Suncor, or other oil companies...  That's where he could get a return on this investment...
2309 2018-10-27 17:57:50 One last question. Do you eat your white rich with stew or oil and Maggi?
2310 2018-10-27 17:57:49 Lol Anty teddy sorry ooo we just want to make u understand.
2311 2018-10-27 17:57:45 That's why you Crush them with the "Not Withstanding Clause"...... but we know Trudeau doesn't like Oil and wants to Crush Alberta, so he won't use it.
2312 2018-10-27 17:57:43 Is that correct? Hand painted oil on canvas for $56.58?
2313 2018-10-27 17:57:38 مش انا خالص
2314 2018-10-27 17:57:35 This coconut oil just effed up my hair.
2315 2018-10-27 17:57:30 Trumps solution to guns is more guns I’d love to see him deal with an oil fire 
2316 2018-10-27 17:57:07 Apply something that contains menthol (like Vicks salve,  Honest's breathe easy, biofreeze,  or tee tree oil,  something tingly) to the center of your forehead and on your temples. Reapply as needed!!
2317 2018-10-27 17:57:01 Imagine how smooth you’d feel after laying in a tub filled with warm coconut oil
2318 2018-10-27 17:56:56 This Anty is angry ooo 
2319 2018-10-27 17:56:55 My brother: are you drinking oil?
Me: yeah olive
Bro: oh at least it’s not canola
2320 2018-10-27 17:56:50 Need a oil change and new break pads .
2321 2018-10-27 17:56:48 I dnt know why these guy will be jumping on peoples mention. With your white face like willi willi. @oil_shaeikh
2322 2018-10-27 17:56:37 Yes but the "expert"s are so cynical of anything that any oiler management does, they think everything is going to be failure. I love how engaged the oil fanbase, it's the constant cynicism and pessimistic view I'm done with
2323 2018-10-27 17:56:21 The 'controlling groups' who finance and maintain this obvious humanity-uniting propaganda farce need it to continue in order to control rival developing nations' economic progress. Without essential oil, gas & coal which create evil co2, these nations can't grow as they'd like!
2324 2018-10-27 17:56:16 and the private companies move on, or take business else where.
Now, This should be obvious that the demand for oil isn't going to increase, it's gonna decrease.  So, why a Bank CEO would push for Canada to invest in this high risk deal ?
2325 2018-10-27 17:56:09 I got paint in my hair, on my legs, arms, basically i am covered in paint and I can’t wash it off. I have to wipe it off with turpentine oil and ain’t nobody got time for that. So i am gonna sleep like this, finish painting and then wipe it.
2326 2018-10-27 17:56:07 Hemp oil
2327 2018-10-27 17:55:58 There is also a oil field  located in  the clyde basin.
2328 2018-10-27 17:55:38 I should probably get an oil change this weekend lol
2329 2018-10-27 17:55:37 Now I’m at my car dealer getting my first oil change & tire rotation. 
2330 2018-10-27 17:55:28 You freeze the money..you stop oil exports, you make it so they don’t spend it on wars in Syria and cause instability. I didn’t say take it..
2331 2018-10-27 17:55:26 Claiming a cure, especially for cancer, would be going too far but some essential oils can help to alleviate some symptoms. External application of lavender oil can help with muscular pain and tension headaches. Always check for any adverse reactions.
2332 2018-10-27 17:55:25 What jobs? Pardon the pun but the oil industry is a dinosaur. We need 2 move to clean energy NOW. Stop listening 2 fear mongering conservative PACs. We are all going 2 have to live with the consequences of a warming planet. Horse-and-buggy owners cried too - there was too much 
2333 2018-10-27 17:55:24 U apply coconut oil Archu?
2334 2018-10-27 17:55:24 With one litre of palm oil..

2335 2018-10-27 17:55:17 WHY I AM VOTING A BUSINESS MAN
LET IT SINK!!!
Buhari govt has EARNED $121 billion from May
2015 to June 2018 from oil revenue.
Apart from all these earnings accrued to Nigeria
which include FIRS,CUSTOMS,JAMB,$322million
Abacha loot etc. Buhari govt has BORROWED
N22trillion!
2336 2018-10-27 17:55:11 This looks like an oil painting, damn you kev
2337 2018-10-27 17:55:10 Thoughts and prayers no action...thoughts and prayers no action... thoughts and prayers no action....you see where this is going.  NRA ownes you as well as big Pharma, Oil and Gas, and your grandparents the Koch Brothers
2338 2018-10-27 17:54:57 Happy for you!  Please try organic carrots that still have their tops on them when purchased.  When fresh (not bendy), they are super sweet and don't taste musty in the winter like most carrots.  If you roast them with a little bit of olive oil and salt, they taste like candy.
2339 2018-10-27 17:54:51 google told me oregano oil helps with acne and now im walking round smelling like a damn pizza. next

2341 2018-10-27 17:54:42 Still hoping you will support Dr. Kenneth Wright over Ted Lieu who leaves homeless Veterans to sleep outside the W LA VA while he leases their land to oil drilling (too close to the hospital) andTom Hanks for Shakespeare. @drwright4congr1 #stoptedlieu @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump
2342 2018-10-27 17:54:34 U do realize that 99% of the THC is taken out of cannabis oil don't you, it does not have the same properties as say the weed u buy of the street, it isn't phsyco active which is why it is prescribed.....

2349 2018-10-27 17:53:11 Piers, do you agree with that? That it was created to put an end to “Big Oil”? (You do know what “nix” means, don’t you?) I thought you believed that Big Oil was actually behind it?
2350 2018-10-27 17:52:49 Trump is auctioning off millions of acres for oil & gas and rolling  back environmental regulations of OUR PRISTINE LAND. More $$$$ for polluters & YOU! That is NOT what we want!  ENOUGH ALREADY WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR COUNTRY. YOU LOST MY VOTE! SHAME ON YOU FOR LYING TO  US!
2351 2018-10-27 17:52:47 Oh no doubt america wants their share of oil fields just like all of the other big countries do.
2352 2018-10-27 17:52:46 I will not argue with you but this is what you wrote.... Now d same barrel is about $ 40,Oil is the main source of the revenue of Nigeria. I wonder how now turned to 3 years ago. Fool

2355 2018-10-27 17:52:37 This is BAD.  This Bank CEO is pushing hard for Canada to invest heavily in the industry..  Just go read the story...  This Bank CEO is making bold claims about this. 
If Canada buys this Sales pitch, we WILL have an economy disaster when the demand for oil drops, ..
2356 2018-10-27 17:52:35 my mom has (food grade) coconut oil in her shower and sometimes when i come home i just sit in the shower and eat it
2357 2018-10-27 17:52:28 Wisconsin is cheese

Kansas has some oil but overall is a second-rate Nebraska which is a second raid Iowa
2358 2018-10-27 17:52:27 Norway's publicly owned oil industry is a good example of something we could have done with the Corrib; Statoil offered us help there but we rejected it. As for safe fracking, that's a contradiction in terms. Good we banned it; pumping chemical soup into the ground is a bad idea.
2359 2018-10-27 17:52:26 Of course, your snake oil rally MUST go on! Euradick!
2360 2018-10-27 17:52:18 I bet it looks alot better than 99% of the world. You ever been to South America or Africa? I have. Built houses for people on a mountain that lived in cardboard boxes and got their water delivered to them once a week from a truck. They stored it in rusty 50gal oil drums.
2361 2018-10-27 17:52:16 I'm tempted to adopt jojoba oil as my stable body oil. The stuff is fading out my dark spots amazingly
2362 2018-10-27 17:52:12 I’ve heard Lavender or Peppermint oil helps
2363 2018-10-27 17:52:07 Ok, then.  I won't try, but take a look at what that would amount to all of Russia oil and gas exports plus all of Chinese oil and gas imports for this year and compare with the dollar's turnover in the fx market last week.
2364 2018-10-27 17:52:04 The oil is still being pumped into Bottas' car. It will need to be fired up and then. VB can climb in and head out. He will be out late FP1
2365 2018-10-27 17:51:49 The ladies are too desperate
2366 2018-10-27 17:51:47 So when did oil go up to 100$ post barrel?

So you want them to spend all the money Nigeria receive and not save?

Just like your PDP?

Awon olorikori.

This is what a PDP education will get you.
2367 2018-10-27 17:51:46 I recently got a shower comb infused with argan oil, I think its helping a lot

2371 2018-10-27 17:51:29 I dont think San Francisco has oil though
2372 2018-10-27 17:51:15 
2373 2018-10-27 17:50:54 Thanks to your fear and ignorance, and being duped into voting for oil company puppets, we're not even going to have countries in 100 years. Hope all that "winning" you're doing will be worth it.
2374 2018-10-27 17:50:35 well because china and russia would anyway. this is why the West should not buy Saudi oil, so they can't buy our weapons or anybody's for that matter. We can replace their supply  on the market.
2375 2018-10-27 17:50:28 When we lived in Australia we would use Eucalyptus oil, it dissolves the glue !
2376 2018-10-27 17:50:27 It’s rubbing down my body in coconut oil season 
2377 2018-10-27 17:50:13 I frankly think no one needs to hear anything he has to say. He's incapable of being presidential, he's just a snake oil salesman with no real compassion for anyone other than himself. The media needs to stop fixating on every utterance he makes.
2378 2018-10-27 17:50:07 All the republicans really want is to extract every single dollar and drop of oil from the earth and if they have to recite some violent racists to mail bombs or shoot places up in the process they’ll do it

2381 2018-10-27 17:49:47 Only way inflation doesn't go sky high is if oil prices fall. And if they do then PTI will stay, no one can stop them.

2407 2018-10-27 17:47:19 The oil industry creates a lot of revenue, but that revenue does not trickle down. 

Oil prices going up/pipelines not being extended doesn’t hurt struggling Canadians. It hurts people in Calgary and Edmonton who suddenly can’t afford a fourth car AND their mansion’s mortgage.

2417 2018-10-27 17:45:54 I've been saying how Trump is so distanced from Americans and has never, nor understands how to, change the oil on a car.  Then it was, he's probably never put gas in, then driven a car.  Then I saw this.

As a joint venture partner, NNOC was entitled to 182.95 million barrels of oil production. But NNOC did not find buyers for its own share, thereby losing a potential income of $2.8 billion.

2441 2018-10-27 17:43:36 I need someone who knows cars with me when I go cause idk shit  how do you find the miles and know what oil your car needs? I will tell these people Jamaican castor oil idc

2444 2018-10-27 17:43:17 @vauxhall hi, would you expect the oil and water pumps to fail on a 64 plate Astra with 26k on the clock? Very disappointed with this car
2445 2018-10-27 17:43:17 Hope that too. But it is mainly trumpys responsibility now, not to put more oil into the fire. Blaming media and dems will not help st all

2448 2018-10-27 17:43:05 Get that goat off the sidewalk before it leaks oil all over the place.
2449 2018-10-27 17:43:00 This↓ To be absolutely clear, if fracking in the UK had zero seismic consequences and the oil flowed out like beer from a tap ...
2450 2018-10-27 17:42:50 The only weapon oil companies have is doubt. They are having a fair amount of success with the strategy.
2451 2018-10-27 17:42:45 I burned both my hands with oil this morning. Fml.
2452 2018-10-27 17:42:43 The president is terrible and he isn’t a leader. He is a snake oil salesman and some of y’all are just too dumb to fall for his shit.

2456 2018-10-27 17:42:18 Thank you!! I think the smell of being covered in coconut oil was worth it
2457 2018-10-27 17:42:18 I think I’m cursed todayyyy hahaaa. I’ve got hot oil splashed all over my left hand. This has happened before but damn it still nips
2458 2018-10-27 17:41:54  The most debt combined of all presidents. Housing market hit all time low and welfare all time high. Oil all time high and the list kept going.
2459 2018-10-27 17:41:49 I need to go get an oil change

2463 2018-10-27 17:41:29 Yay, more immigrants, more schools, more healthcare "as a human right," more immigrants, what CA & the nation needs!  More, more & more if u vote for Newsome.  But more people need more oil, protect from drilling too?  No sense.
2464 2018-10-27 17:41:13 This happened to me! I had a crazy breakout which was weird for my age. My dermatologist prescribed me something but she also told me to purchase the Oil Free Acne Wash from Neutrogena and now my skin is clear. I also moisturize with an oil free SPF moisturizer. Could try that
2465 2018-10-27 17:41:02 Cookies and Cream oil. You don't need it but you want it.
2466 2018-10-27 17:40:56 You fill each empty square with a bit of MOTOR OIL to complete the zoning. It looks rather striking to you. You can hardly imagine that an up and coming young can trying to make it in the world would not be delighted to live in your fair district.
2467 2018-10-27 17:40:32 髪がさーサラサラしてるのちょっと気にしてんだよなー
2468 2018-10-27 17:40:28 Ha ha , Hell no, a strong Alberta just makes BC stronger. Now we just need to get oil to tide water and Alberta can put it's largest labour force back on the job.

2472 2018-10-27 17:39:59 I propose business owners ban employees from wearing patchouli oil, I have already banned one Bob and Steve’s and one Green Mill, on a side note, do you not realize you smell like fucking shit. 
2473 2018-10-27 17:39:49 Ok. You’re going overboard. You can cook damn near anything you cook with oil/butter with bacon grease. I don’t have to google that. My maw kept bacon grease on the stove at times. I was asking specifically what YOU wanted it for. Thanks. Smh
2474 2018-10-27 17:39:39 Wish I had some oil , Really don’t wanna feel shit
2475 2018-10-27 17:39:39 infact every second stock i m checking, showing it check kolte/kirloskar oil also
2476 2018-10-27 17:39:27 The Innocent have no say. How can America support this? Just for oil and money? people need to wake up and look around. get educated about World Politics and how the US can support this, turning a blind eye.

2484 2018-10-27 17:38:18 well I do feel Trump should continue to sell arms to Saudi despite the horrendous situation in Yemen 

The middle east would be far more unstable if they turned to Russia - it was an unfair question to ask you 

USA must try try influence Saudi - until world not oil dependant
2485 2018-10-27 17:38:02 @Itcosmetics I have recently purchased the CC cream at the Boots counter in Westfields London. H/ever it leaves my face very greasy. Today I asked for a sample of the oil free version and I was point blank refused by the lady. Her words were ‘we are not allowed to give samples’
2486 2018-10-27 17:37:56 I ddnt say there was no consent ! I dunno why u are attacking me with questions! Is it me that reported this news ?
2487 2018-10-27 17:37:50 Hope you like seeing more offshore drilling while you're at the beach. That's what oil companies will convince everyone they need if demand for gas remains unchecked. #VoteNoOn6 if you want clean beaches and air.
2488 2018-10-27 17:37:30 あー///お願いしまぁーす
2489 2018-10-27 17:37:21  like everything except those things- deregulation of the oil sector (this is going to be a bomb shell for you- the majority of the oil sector is owned by Americans), ensuring strong  relations, or appointing Kavanaugh. Ignorance is bliss.
2490 2018-10-27 17:37:10 Oil and gas industry and mining are driving GHG emissions. Transportation sector also has seen increase in emissions. Half from domestic, half from freight like trucking. Industry needs more attention - Emily Eaton #yqr #sask #canlab #cdnpoli #JustTransition

 I mean same, tbh
2495 2018-10-27 17:36:27 Oh, sure- you “love” coffee... but do you use the grounds from your last cup of coffee as a body scrub by mixing it with avocado oil and then drink coffee in the shower while scrubbing yourself with coffee?!

2498 2018-10-27 17:36:08 As stated you need to stop with the palm oil now. Until that leaping bunny is on your products I won't buy or believe it. Also hoping it's true that you don't deal with countries which do require testing 
2499 2018-10-27 17:35:51 As I'm working with herbs from my garden today- making a massage oil for Hawkeye's bad back- it hits me how much of a refuge the plants have become for me. Mental "comfort food", something steady in crazy times. I'm so grateful! And I wonder...

Have you hugged a plant today?
2500 2018-10-27 17:35:41 No no. You put oil first. Then water. Then tomatoes. Then the matooke. Then onions last. You can add royco also if you want.

2511 2018-10-27 17:34:45 Given that the US-Saudi relationship is strictly built on commerce - oil or otherwise - it is very predictable. Thing is, I spent a long time studying US support of autocratic governments and US-Saudi ties have ALWAYS made me uneasy.
2512 2018-10-27 17:34:39 Well did they oil them?  lmao
2513 2018-10-27 17:34:36 Pls oil now is more than 70$ per barrel. What let to recession was archaic policies of Buhari not GEJ. How long did it take Buhari to appoint his ministers? What about his policy against the dollars? Please be wise in your partial judgement

2517 2018-10-27 17:34:21 Oil & gas exploration in Niger delta doesn't consider life nor environment of inhabitants of the area, but cows are considered in infrastructural development in the north. What a shame! Nigeria is united on oil.

2519 2018-10-27 17:34:09 Agreed;they are. In this case he has not. A pollutant is a substance introduced into the environment that adversely affects a resource. It doesn’t matter if the pollutant is “natural”. For example crude oil is natural, yet is a pollutant when dumped into streams or the ocean.

2535 2018-10-27 17:32:29 I’m not gonna bother to look all these up because the few I did look up show what a moronic list this is. ‘Who’s ass to kick’ referred to finding out which BP employees were responsible for the gulf oil spill and ‘punish your enemies’ was referring to voting them out.

2537 2018-10-27 17:32:17 @Asad_Umar I congratulate you and PTI Govt for bringing UAE/Saudi investment. Just a reminder for removing Oil and Gas professional from Adnoc company over last 5years in the name of security pass and other issues to be highlighted to UAE delegation.
2538 2018-10-27 17:32:12 Gall is the word your looking for. If they had balls, they would have thrown themselves off a bridge by now.
2539 2018-10-27 17:32:07 God help us!
2540 2018-10-27 17:32:04 That sucks! Use water, glue, and toilet paper. It's a good replacement for the liquid latex. Put a little bit of tea tree oil on the aggravated part of your skin.
2541 2018-10-27 17:31:59 Great Harley dealership, got my oil changed there few years ago they would also wash ur bike, did a great job

2544 2018-10-27 17:31:23 And because of the the Gov has to "please" to groups... Citizens, and Oil companies...  Our gov cannot impose restrictions on them....  they are owned by shareholders on the Stock market... So, this "carbon" tax is just to appear like a solution.  It is not....
2545 2018-10-27 17:31:05 I’ll bring the baby oil
2546 2018-10-27 17:30:54 Do we pack all the royal brides in olive oil? Wasn't aware of this but it wouldn't surprise me, obviously. Is it something shape-shifting mind control lizard related.
2547 2018-10-27 17:30:41 They are nothing but sleazy snake oil salesmen.
2548 2018-10-27 17:30:39 You've not answered my question sir.... Ok he initiated projects right? And despite the oil windfall and the Harvard graduate finance minister, all of them uncompleted, what then did that govt. do with our money? That's the question nobody has answered and it's really painful.
2549 2018-10-27 17:30:33 Hmm. Maybe you should try cocoa butter and coconut oil and see if that has a different result

2553 2018-10-27 17:29:53 @elonmusk do you know about Line 5? Two 65 year old dangerous exposed pipelines moving 23mil gallons of tar sands crude oil under the Straits of Mackinac every day. Massive public will to shut it down. Big part of election. 5 tribes filing lawsuits.

2563 2018-10-27 17:29:02 Those of you still rooting for and telling others that the only alternative to President Buhari is Atiku, the only thing I will tell you is look at Venezuela and learn from their experience. That country produces more oil than Nigeria but look at what corruption has done to them.
2564 2018-10-27 17:28:56 I just knew it was emergency brake and oil
2565 2018-10-27 17:28:46 I got 3/4 cup of Raw Purified Cannabis Oil for $75. You can use the oil to cook whatever tf you want that can be fried and u gon be high as Falcon Pussy. HML

2568 2018-10-27 17:28:36 I like going to oil changes where the shop doesn’t try to take advantage of me. I appreciate that.
2569 2018-10-27 17:28:29 Try an airfryer, I’d recommend coating them in oil or a mixture of oil & dripping, but if you’re really brave just dripping. I’ve tried all three & they barely have any oil or fat on them when finished, what they do have is flavour 
2570 2018-10-27 17:28:18 This Govt doesn't mine/d what they get up to.  Oil bet they just think it's a gas, gas, gas.

Gilly and Harrison come in.

Sauter, Gragsn, Rhodes and Crafton stay out.

Lines tells Harrison, "Its okay. We're not here for stage points."

2574 2018-10-27 17:28:03 The problem is most agree with it. And many that disagree live in fear of coming out. We are like oil & water our two religions don’t and have never gotten along, to mix them heavily into our Judeo Christian nation is a great mistake and one brought on by the Democratic left

2576 2018-10-27 17:27:56 All you have is oil which the Americans could take from you or install a ‘new regime’ Faisal style. People tend to hate savages that butcher a man for expressing an opinion when they take time from their hectic schedule of killing children in Yemen - what exactly is KSA good for?

2584 2018-10-27 17:27:20 Without OIL these Arabs would have been shearing goats and cows. 

It's so unfortunate that Muslims are not treated equally by so called pure Muslims viz ARABS.

2589 2018-10-27 17:26:55 In general we have issues with protein and oil content. This year with a very dry July August, we faced with immature green. Buyers not wanting to accept anything over 3% green even at a discount. Try that schedule on. Ha.

Long Term: Range $70 / $80.
2592 2018-10-27 17:26:38 Oil is still spewing into the Gulf and there is no way to stop it. An on going crime scene. Now Trump wants to let them drill for oil all up and down the East Coast. He says “the rigs are too far out to be seen so what is the problem?”

2594 2018-10-27 17:26:36 right...  but in theory the rebates given shouldn't be more then the added expense on the family..  Anyway... it's pointless trying to understand the logic when the plan is flawed to begin with.
Private sector owns the oil resources, not our country...
2595 2018-10-27 17:26:29 How about an import tax on oil from Saudi Arabia?

2601 2018-10-27 17:25:24 Did you know that CBD oil is amazing for helping relieve your pets anxiety? 
When CBD is introduced to your pet’s brain, then it can normalize and stabilize the chemical fluctuations that cause anxiety resulting in a much happier pet!
2602 2018-10-27 17:25:22 Telemarketer for a Duct Cleaning company called up.  I decided to have some fun and left them on the phone trying figure if they could get the oil off the feathers or not. "I mean the dog and the cow are ok and pretty clean but …" :)

You absolute moron! That's just my #Twitter name you fool.

Most, if not all, of the middle east regimes are supported and kept in power by one of the two world super powers to let the oil flow for our benefit in #Europe & #America.

They'll be changed when their time comes.
2611 2018-10-27 17:24:10 Whenever I’m driving and I smell burning oil I know that I’m driving behind some young girl who doesn’t know what a car is and hasn’t changed her oil in 4 years

2615 2018-10-27 17:23:46 You can have them. Used to be a huge supernatural fan(own 8 seasons) but then Jarod's wife was raising $$ for Planned Parenthood. I don't understand why anyone would support Beto? Didn't he want to raise oil $10 more a gallon?!? If I lived in Texas I'd be mad.

2623 2018-10-27 17:22:29 He’s got a point. Scotland is wanted for her oil and natural resources: it generates money for Westminster. Why continue with the rest of union when the golden goose has gone and rUK is half an island?

2642 2018-10-27 17:19:30 So @TiresPlus just called me. Apparently it was not transmission fluid leaking from my car... my oil filter exploded! The same one they put in 2 weeks ago. The guy said he had never seen anything like it. Cleaned everything out and not charging me. They’re good people. 
2643 2018-10-27 17:19:30 The forecasts say next year by June inflation will be 14%, so triple what it was under PMLN. We will have data month by month, let's see, maybe the right time will come sooner. And only way inflation doesn't go as high is if oil prices fall.

But thats far from healthy for your skull. You've got to let it dry for at least 24 hours, otherwise the oil that repairs the hair cant spread itself from the follicle down.
2672 2018-10-27 17:15:59 It is not hard tbh, just some seasoned breadcrumbs on chicken tenders and bake at 400 for 15-20 minutes...sometimes I dip them in Franks and then the breadcrumbs. You can also "fry" them in the oven with a deep pan and about 1/4 cup of oil to rest them in. Same temp and time.

Itvl was 75% to 85% of the National GDP. OIL AT MY FLINT HILLS HAS ALWAYS BEEN LESS THAN 1% OF

Navy & airborne strike complete with parachute jump, sniper (tak glorified macam hollywood, more realistic), bomb difuser, infiltrate hijacked ship and climax fight at offshore oil rig platform!

2725 2018-10-27 17:09:48 Don't apologise. Gave me a much needed giggle actually. We usually go to a place to have oil put in on it's own. Ours normally comes as part of the yearly service or the MOT. You guys still have the thing where uniformed men run up to you when you drive into a service station?
2726 2018-10-27 17:09:48 A squirt of WD-40 is good for most surfaces, though not sure if that might damage wood - maybe try linseed oil?
2727 2018-10-27 17:09:35 I will never in my life encourage anyone to drink castor oil

According to the World Health Organization, evidence is "convincing" that consumption of palmitic acid increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

Frytol is derived from palm oil.

2738 2018-10-27 17:08:05 I'm also planning to try scenting at least one batch with eucalyptus oil; the menthol in eucalyptus oil helps break up congestion, so it's great to have on hand for cold and flu season. x3

2745 2018-10-27 17:07:16 thus your arguement regarding unemployment is addressing a sympthom of the problem not the disease the disease is a shrinking economy which is commodity based and highly dependent onFDI now only oil is a viable commodity to nationalise not the minerals thats the problem
2746 2018-10-27 17:07:13 Rush, Hannity, Alex Jones, and all the rest of the conspiracy theory snake oil salesmen have blood on their hands. 

And the GOP stays silent.

We need to VOTE these people out and put this beautiful country back on track.

2755 2018-10-27 17:06:09 For 2000 years, mankind has used pres. to extract vegetable oil. It turns out that nature has its own "pres." - the effect of "fatal pressure." The discovered effect became the basis of 4marvel technology: produces natural cosmetics,health food and even detergents.  #technologies
2756 2018-10-27 17:06:01 I sometimes think of the people who do social media for the oil/gas industry. Like guys, you know that what you’re doing now is going to kill you and everyone you know in 30 years, right?
2757 2018-10-27 17:05:56 That's still way too high.
They must be polling the magats at one of his big tent snake oil shows.

2760 2018-10-27 17:05:37 Truly disgusting to see what vile delusional pukes we have created in this country. And it's capitalism, baby! No different than the snake oil salesmen 100 yrs ago that  drained the rubes of their money & were long gone by the time the rubes figured it out. That's Conservatism

It's a FACT .

2769 2018-10-27 17:04:21 The relentless negativity surrounding @Tesla considering the “game changing” outcome for the environment of EV’s is so annoying!

Old oil, lacklustre mainstream car manufacturers & investors playing their hand only, should never be able to influence things as they are

2774 2018-10-27 17:03:29 I don't care for a sweet talk no action President . I don't care if he does not fact check sometimes. We had 8 years of  snake oil salesman as president that drove our economy down the gutter!  It's time to MAGA!
2775 2018-10-27 17:03:20 not with oil itself cos the only times i've ever had a problem i've just got it in a spray form from the chemists? that works and is a lot less scary

2784 2018-10-27 17:02:02 I hate when you take your car to get an oil change and they ask you if you want to buy 6 other things for your car...NO i wanna buy and oil change that’s why i’m here!!
2785 2018-10-27 17:01:58 It's literally just oil. The US finna raid them tiddies in a minute
2786 2018-10-27 17:01:56 Fixed predictable costs (oil change) doesn’t need insurance. Insurance only makes sense for highly variable costs when pooling of risks adds value. Collisions, Hail, Flood, Fire, Surgeries, Cancer etc. Deductibles can cover basics to reduce paperwork.

2799 2018-10-27 17:00:53 Boban I think there should be a +ve impact on the #CurrentAccount starting Nov-18, once the Saudi oil facility (deferred payment) comes into play. A similar facility is being negotiated with the UAE as well. Potentially $6bn out of a total oil import bill of $18bn to be deferred.

They felt lost & abandoned by change in their country until the snake oil salesman came & told them he had magic beans to turn back the clock.
And those beans gave the REST of us gas!

Forget about exporting #Fracking, @claireperrymp @beisgovuk. Better to export a far smarter BRITISH invention: a machine that converts end-of-life plastics to oil - key feedstock for the petrochemical industry.

2826 2018-10-27 16:58:14 If for some ungodly reason this blue wave fizzles. Here are some things that you can do to help make a difference.

1. Use as little oil based products as possible. (Gasoline, tires, plastics, stryafoam, etc)

2. Dont by U.S.A made products. (Except for Tesla’s)

3. Quit Church.

2829 2018-10-27 16:58:07 Southern countries are looking better. Australia works for me. I’d rather have snow, but Russia is looking at oil under arctic ice and Norway is hosting war games in case they are invaded. China has been trying to buy bases in Greenland for years. Our planet needs this #bluewave
2830 2018-10-27 16:58:07 Meanwhile, an article about Russian arctic capabilities in the event of a Cold War at the poles resurfaced. Norway is having war games should an invasion happen. Russia and China want the oil. That answers why we pulled out of the #ParisClimateAccord. Russia want the ice.

2840 2018-10-27 16:57:31 Applying your logic government should also ban hotels for unhygienic oil . Ban rickshaws and buses for pollution ban bikes for noise pollution and ban spitting, unhygienic clothes, slums and impose co2 emissions regulation . Grow up dude this is not the way to collect money

2853 2018-10-27 16:55:44 That's like saying if you buy the oil, you too are complicit.

And yet, the headless corpse of a woman in a car park, or again 5 headless bodies strung up between cranes is not quite enough for our moral outrage.
2854 2018-10-27 16:55:41 Heat the pan first at medium heat and then oil. Pour batter and let is set before flipping.
2855 2018-10-27 16:55:38 @realDonaldTrump I'm sure the dirty capitalists, with the help of the media, want to save the Iranian regime at any cost. Now it's important to look at how important the sanctions are for oil, which is what everyone thinks.
2856 2018-10-27 16:55:36 my face is so mf oily the US is gonna try and invade my face for oil next
2857 2018-10-27 16:55:33 Liam Plunkett into the attack. He's definitely using beard oil. Serious pace first up, bouncer through to Jos for a dot. Kamindu then lifts it over midwicket for 4. Sumptious. Another 4 over mid off. No fielders in the air mate. Nice. 9 off the over. 59/3 off 8 #SLvENG
2858 2018-10-27 16:55:32 Why does it take so long for an oil change 
2859 2018-10-27 16:55:28 y’all i got an oil defuser and new bathroom stuff do NOT fucking talk to me
2860 2018-10-27 16:55:23 Papas, steamed and tossed with olive oil.
2861 2018-10-27 16:55:22 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
2862 2018-10-27 16:55:17 I probably spent too much money on my oil change tbh 
2863 2018-10-27 16:55:13 Hahaha not like the money that is bankrolling arguments like the one you're making. Coal, oil and other industries with much deeper products. Do you even know any scientists? What do you think they make? 
2864 2018-10-27 16:55:11 @realDonaldTrump I want to talk to the American people, there is a serial conspiracy, something happens when people demand a full boycott of oil. The Saudi Arabian critic, the bombing, the killing of the Jews, all this happened when people spoke of sanctions.
2865 2018-10-27 16:55:07 olive oil (not kidding google it)
2866 2018-10-27 16:54:37 1 trip to town, 1 ginger beer(alcoholic- recommended), 1 berroca ( jury’s out), bacon-eggs-white sourdough , 1 cod liver oil, 2 anti-inflamms (standard), 1 and... let’s say, a half- glasses of merlot. Several asshole co-workers and neighbours. Nicotine(1.6mg- ongoing dosage).
2867 2018-10-27 16:54:22 Magnesium bath salt soaks and then rubs with essential oil mix for pain. Doesn’t take away but at least relaxes the throbbing/burning down to a fuller pain. When it is my skin that is painful and too sensitive to even touch I use a makeup brush to rub the oils on.
2868 2018-10-27 16:54:16 tbh the only thing i use rn is tea tree oil if i have any spots and some cucumber moisturizer idk what brand but i can look it up for u if you want 
2869 2018-10-27 16:53:56 This Castro oil got my hair too thick
2870 2018-10-27 16:53:53 Flew over Northern Iraq last night (Mosul area)- seeing the oil wells on fire (orange fires topped by black clouds) made this tragedy come really close.
2871 2018-10-27 16:53:52 I want US to be the world's number one exporter of oil.  I am sure there are some who would not like that.
2872 2018-10-27 16:53:37 Nothing like waiting 2 and a half hours for an oil change to start off my Saturday 
2873 2018-10-27 16:53:27 Damuwan ka ma karami ne
2874 2018-10-27 16:53:21 Nope...I'm not the one mixing the two like oil and water...I think you'll find
2875 2018-10-27 16:53:13 Peppermint Oil on the back of the neck
2876 2018-10-27 16:53:03 But oil is perfectly safe
2877 2018-10-27 16:53:03 Recipe is:
1 (17.6 ounce) container 2% Greek yogurt (I use the Fage brand)
3 tablespoons mayonnaise w/ avocado oil
2 cups finely chopped baby spinach
1/2 cup roasted red bell pepper, finely minced
1/2 teaspoon sea salt

2883 2018-10-27 16:52:21 it's RSO/FECO oil and it was administered directly on the tumor as you can see from the photos. the muddy black thing is cannabis oil
2884 2018-10-27 16:52:13 Putting coconut oil in my eyebrows really has helped me grow them better! I massage it in before i go to sleep
2885 2018-10-27 16:52:09 What does our tattoo say on your forearm, “lavender oil”??
2886 2018-10-27 16:52:03 Happy birthday ja 
2887 2018-10-27 16:51:57 Somebody pay for my oil change

2889 2018-10-27 16:51:47 Yesterday I roasted some red & yellow bell peppers, asparagus & zucchini, with olive oil, herbs & pepper flakes. They'll go on pizza and in salads in the coming week. Pepper up, people!
2890 2018-10-27 16:51:44 ... and for those of you who are wondering how do these two oil‘s work together to thwart cancer...
2891 2018-10-27 16:51:43 Hopefully once these missiles are able to reach the Saudi and UAE oil infrastructure then the kings of these countries will be forced to end the Genocide against the people of Yemen
2892 2018-10-27 16:51:13 The media stokes it continually...especiality fomenting violence regarding race issue....they never miss a chance to throw oil on any fire.
2893 2018-10-27 16:51:13 My man, you may know rocks and oil, but you have no idea of how pissed off the average Texas farmer or rancher is.
Not to mention the teachers, factory workers, and the folks on the third shifts...
You should stick to what makes you money.
2894 2018-10-27 16:51:12 เอ่อสันดานชิบหาย
2895 2018-10-27 16:51:12 It’s not my first time doing an oil change but my dad said he was on his way since my moms needs hers done too and I’m freaking out because he’s not here yet and I’m next in line 
2896 2018-10-27 16:50:54 My dad said we are creating a bunch of snowflakes who need CBD oil to get through the day when hes from the valium generation
2897 2018-10-27 16:50:42 Chili infused Oil. 
Could almost put it on anything.
2898 2018-10-27 16:50:15 Baby oil booty massages
2899 2018-10-27 16:50:03 Aren't you lucky, gas prices go up when the cost of a barrel of oil goes up. Trump ensuring the market will loose millions of barrels oil will ensure the price goes up. And his buddies make more money. And when the economy tanks so will your 401k.
2900 2018-10-27 16:50:02 @BarbraStreisand What a stupid tweet!  President Trump has been viciously attacked by the left for 2 yrs . Trump so terrible the economy roaring, Unemployment @ decades low, GDP from 2% to 4%, Millions of jobs returning, U.S oil independent. He is a fat egg?
2901 2018-10-27 16:50:02 It pales in comparison with the money that’s been poured to your campaign by oil, pharmaceutical & military contractors, throughout the years doesn’t it? In any case, if it comes from individuals, what’s the problem with that? Stop the fear monger already, “Ted”!
2902 2018-10-27 16:50:00 Yeah. I think I got it. Putting it in to season with a higher heat and a thinner layer of oil. If it doesn't cook well after that I'll start with a new one.
2903 2018-10-27 16:49:56 Does everyone wake up with what feels like 10lbs of oil on their face or is that just me?
2904 2018-10-27 16:49:52 I wouldn't have a problem even if it was Cannabis oil. Only a matter of time before it's legal. The stuff is miracle oil!
2905 2018-10-27 16:49:33 It’s gonna be 12pm, I go in at 1:30pm until 3am and I still haven’t unpacked to pack and still haven’t gotten an oil change and we leave as soon as I get off work tonight 
2906 2018-10-27 16:49:28 Maulvi sahib what we have problem with Israel.EGYPT  QATAR MANY OTHER COUNTRIES ACCEPTED ISRAEL .WHY U PEOPLE POURING OIL.ON THIS STUPID    issue .if Arabs don't have any issue why us.

2912 2018-10-27 16:48:46 @OttleyJam Notice how there was no answer. Because they've been brainwashed. They think this snake oil salesman actually has a place for them at the table. #WRONG! How convenient that less than 2 wks before the midterms he has this event. You've been used!
2913 2018-10-27 16:48:44 Its an outrage that Australia has given special status to muslims. Your govt ought to be destroyed along with the whole british monarchy that has sold out to the oil rich arabs.
2914 2018-10-27 16:48:43 roasted potatoes with thyme and olive oil seasoning remain superior above all forms of potatoes
2915 2018-10-27 16:48:34 Is it just me but I imagine Venoms cum is black and slightly iridescent and greasy like crude oil slick
2916 2018-10-27 16:48:23 Seconded. I love that you aren't contributing to palm oil and the destruction of the planet.
Doesn't stop coconut being gross though.
2917 2018-10-27 16:48:07 Humans need to stop consuming krill oil so that we can continue to see this gorgeous sight.
2918 2018-10-27 16:48:02 Where and when is it posted at the concerts?
2919 2018-10-27 16:47:53 If you don’t shave with coconut oil you weird (females) that shit works wonders and leaves you baby smooth
2920 2018-10-27 16:47:46 High debt, massive interest payments every month, terribly high unemployment numbers, no pipelines, oil sand locked in...damn disaster at these commodity prices #cdnpoli #ABpoli #ableg
2921 2018-10-27 16:47:39 Big oil admits they could not exist without gov subsidies. We bail out Wall Street. Bailouts and subsidies R welfare. Wal-Mart , Corp America , Wall Sreet collect approx 80% of each welfare dollar. Don't take my word for it..the gov budget is accessible to anyone.
2922 2018-10-27 16:47:36 Do you have coconut oil about? Any oil should do the trick--including olive, in a pinch.
2923 2018-10-27 16:47:26 #Iran is India’s largest oil supplier.if we consist buying oil from iran then #USA's CATSA - the sanctions on trade with Iran will lead to technology denials,visa bans&access restrictions to US banking,currency&financing.
Then how #India deal with it?
@PMOIndia @narendramodi
2924 2018-10-27 16:47:23 Why are working people supporting this wealthy, narcissistic snake oil salesman? I just don’t get it...
2925 2018-10-27 16:47:22 It's a tax on sunlight as fossil fuels are stored sunlight. No sunlight=no coal, oil, or life. When we burn fuel we restore Carbon back into the atmosphere to be used again in the production of life. Removing carbon=death- don't be fooled. #carbontax is a tax on breathing
2926 2018-10-27 16:47:22 I ordered chinese and they forgot my chilli oil. 
2927 2018-10-27 16:47:18 Oil change cost 100 dollars
2928 2018-10-27 16:46:56 I smell conspiracy CIA staged this murder and the next stop for war is Saudi Arabia after all there the cost of drilling is a little less expansion then Iraq. Lets play oil dreams fairy tail.
2929 2018-10-27 16:46:49 I’m losing my mind I’m finally on the plane but thEY HAVE TO CHANGE THE OIL FILTER
2930 2018-10-27 16:46:47 Notice how he looks out the corner of his eyes when he's selling snake oil?
2931 2018-10-27 16:46:31 Coconut oil in the food helps.  The groomer we use has a special micro bubble treatment device that helps my Shar Pei’s skin. Check if a groomer near you has one.
2932 2018-10-27 16:46:30 Henry Kissinger, 'If you can control the oil you can control entire nations or groups of nations.' AGW is an obvious propaganda tool used to agitate useful idiots and extract taxes. Developing rival nations can't grow without massive use of oil & coal which=co2 poison!

My boss: really dude 
2935 2018-10-27 16:46:15 You can expect anything frn saudia. Dig deep into history. It was saudia arab who was responsible for the creation of israel state on the promise of oil drilling n exploration by the then US administration.

2961 2018-10-27 16:42:58 @ANFordSanford Why make an appointment if it takes around 2hrs for prepaid oil change.  The reason was short staffed on Saturday and a lot of cars came in. If short staffers reduce appointments. And what does it matter to someone with appt that other people come in???

2966 2018-10-27 16:42:39 I gotta get in the rhythm of getting my oil changed as scheduled. I be going 6000 miles between oil changes
2967 2018-10-27 16:42:17 Agreed Woj, clowns are part of the game. Snake oil salesmen are a different animal.
2968 2018-10-27 16:42:13 The watchman also to follow the rules and law. He can not be a dictator as SC will not permit it. Opp parties will hound him. That is why bankruptcy law was passed and you are able to get 42000 crores out of 54000 crores(incl interest). It is a steel company and not oil co.

2971 2018-10-27 16:41:59 I feel like the palm oil argument can be summed up with: No it's not an issue specific to veganism, however, anyone that is trying to be environmentally contentious should do their best to avoid buying products with palm oil bc it's terrible for the environment and deforestation
2972 2018-10-27 16:41:51 God knows what a tremendous amount of money comes from our country into the account of the Jews, for which they do everything. Exempting oil sanctions is a huge disaster and it is never forgivable.

2977 2018-10-27 16:41:28 I wish they'd bring it back.

There are worse things. My mum gave me cod liver oil and malt on a spoon. Every day. I can still recall the taste 
2978 2018-10-27 16:41:19 If crude crashes eventually, it would be bcoz of lesser demand (theoretically) which means oil is getting replaced with alternate sources. How can OMCs benefit in that case?

2989 2018-10-27 16:40:09 Dear Deepak, I love your teachings and have been practicing seeing myself as pure potentiality. But you need to instruct your Choora Center to be mindful of packing shipped products. Alot of paper, trees are wasted just to pack a small oil bottle. Love the oil but too much waste.

2992 2018-10-27 16:40:00 Not too long ago Notley protested the cleanest, safest way to transport oil due to its CO2 foot print. Now she advocates for the dirtiest, least safe method. Is it any wonder she isn't taken seriously by the federal government?

2996 2018-10-27 16:39:21 Oh please. Just knock it off with this fear-mongering. Believe me: We followed the money you have, and it leads back to the NRA, finance corporations, and oil & gas.
2997 2018-10-27 16:39:13 Lee wants us to buy CBD oil
2998 2018-10-27 16:39:12 Gas prices are rising because we are slowly running out of oil, not because Donald Trump is president. It has nothing to do with the economy.
2999 2018-10-27 16:39:00 Why are your gas prices raising when there is supposed to more American oil. Well he's put sanctions on iran. Their oil will go of the market, the barrel of oil goes up. Trump's friends make a killing and you pay more at the pumps. MAGA

3009 2018-10-27 16:37:57 Israel is a means to an end. For Evangelicals, it's about restoring Biblical borders to bring on the Rapture. For those soaking up oil money, it's about having a military anchor in the region to keep control of oil-producing nations.

I don't understand how this is allowed either...
3017 2018-10-27 16:37:00 Here's the good news:
Saudi Arabia and Russia agree that the current Oil price will hurt them more than benefit them as it might hit Global economy. They have agreed to increase in production and as a result, Oil prices might cool down over the next few months !!

3065 2018-10-27 16:29:55 Correct - and unless it’s part of cod liver oil or similar, it will be synthetically isolated and toxic to the body. Like abscobic  acid which most people believe is vitamin c, which it is not.
3066 2018-10-27 16:29:44 How have I spent my Saturday, you ask? Using coconut oil and warm water to slow pick hard wax out of a kittens fur, and then traumatizing the poor thing with a warm sink bath to remove the leftover oil.

The simplest definition:
Capitalism - economy mostly private
Socialism - economy mostly govt run/owned
Even with that simplification we can still debate whether Norway is socialist or not based on their govt's ownership of oil, public holdings of companies, etc.
3098 2018-10-27 16:25:41 それはおかしいでしょ
3099 2018-10-27 16:25:22 Because it was initiated by BP and the oil revenue is offsetting the massive debt induced by the subsidies required to build it. Look I can go on and on about it, kinda my field. I have a MS in this department. Let’s just agree to disagree; you can’t reason with your side.

3107 2018-10-27 16:23:53 I don’t where you get your news but I have an idea. Everything you said is verifiably false. Gas prices are falling again with oil dropping $3 a barrel just the left there day. Our gas prices here dropped 20 cents in just a week. Interest rates rise to slow a booming economy

3133 2018-10-27 16:20:09 Opinion: China asking oil producers to increase output to lower the crude oil price further to equivalent of 40-50 dollars per barrel. Citing the said price range is the most healthy for the world. @Tsinghua_Uni @AlibabaGroup @KremlinRussia_E
3134 2018-10-27 16:20:08 Vehicles are so advanced. Can't even change oil yourself anymore. Everything computerized. Got a 6-yr/120,000 bumper-to-bumper extended warranty on my F150 when I bought it. Shit's too expensive to fix if it breaks.

3136 2018-10-27 16:19:58 Imo its possible the dollar and gold has lost correlation and keeps a bid to protect wealth. Oil copper stocks etc down in deflationary environment, dollar gold bonds up.
3137 2018-10-27 16:19:57 Ermmm my mini is 10 months out its warrenty and the engine is gubbed due to a time chain fault. I took out an extra policy that cost £400 that covers faults like this and they are trying to get out of it by saying my oil tank was at the minimum level.
3138 2018-10-27 16:19:51 Oil industry will be in toilet even if y'all elect your Messiah. More troubling is the anti-democratic rhetoric of said Messiah who lacks IMO a good understanding of issues. Problems with @OilGasCanada present. Pollution on your land a big thing. Our oil isn't cheap to produce.

3148 2018-10-27 16:18:44 i think it depends on the brand. the acrylic and oil paper i have has a weird texture so i wouldn't recommend! but really, you could use any kind of paper, and if it bleeds through, use a tissue to put under to not ruin the next sheet in the sketchbook.

3150 2018-10-27 16:18:01 I had a feeling it was possible but I will say the only reason I have infinite oil/ore on is because I have yet to find a mod that allows the oil/ore to last for years or even one where the pumps/mines draw out the resources from the whole pocket rather than a bit of the pocket
3151 2018-10-27 16:17:55 There is a fracking boom in the USA.  Our biggest user of oil is now pretty much independent. We have to hawk the oil elsewhere. Even w/o paying for liabilities and no oversight (thanks REDA where there is no need to worry about public interest) oil can't sell. Market knows best.
3152 2018-10-27 16:17:51 You got it wrong , it's Obama, Hillary
And it's administration of all Democrats.  Think
Obama let the terrorist go free from jail, who are killing more Americans right now. Obama let the oil leak out into the ocean for 87 days that's a Terrorist.

3166 2018-10-27 16:16:14 If people simply don’t buy them, automakers will get the message. It sure seems like the push is coming from oil industry. Do automakers get some kind of kickback? Is it really more profitable to make vehicles which are worse for environment?

Seems like GOP just use "support" for Israel, because they use Israel like a placeholder.

And I don't know if that's just sad or just scary.  Maybe both.

Absolutely NOT! They strip skin of necessary healing oils. The body reacts by secreting more oil, which can lead to breakouts. They also dry out pores, creating the opposite of a juicy, #hydrated & #healthy glow! #SavorBeauty

3232 2018-10-27 16:08:13 As you know @RandPaul, SA buys our bonds in return for us buying their oil. If that gets disrupted we will likely see the first ever failure of a bond auction and the whole thing then goes south like a duck in winter.

3262 2018-10-27 16:04:01 I've been waiting to try Chick-Fil-A for 10 years. I was in line and then the wife alerted me that they use peanut oil. Guess I'll never have it

3268 2018-10-27 16:03:04 I'll invest in oil business or forex trading.

3284 2018-10-27 16:01:58 From hand to mouth economy. No income security if not for oil revenue from South South.
3285 2018-10-27 16:01:58 What bullshit.  Venezuela nationalized the economy and oil.  Beto isn’t advocating anything like that.  No one with a brain buys this nonsense.
3286 2018-10-27 16:01:57 That's great news but how do you explain this - This December, the federal government will hold a sale of oil and gas leases across Utah. The sale, yet to be finalized, may include thousands of acres & several areas that conservationists would like to see protected as wilderness.

3288 2018-10-27 16:01:46 Pretty sure the one I actually saw was the 504 g bag of frozen ones - is particularly silly 'cause the bag says you can oven cook too and for that they need no oil at all and still come out great…
3289 2018-10-27 16:01:42 なかなか余裕のもかろんさんですね、
3290 2018-10-27 16:01:27 I choked on air when I saw the oil box.
3291 2018-10-27 16:01:27 I cannot recommend pumpkin pie. Slimy and ghastly. Traditional at Thanksgiving in the US and Canada where I was forced to eat it as a lad. Revealing that it isn’t made any other time of year. Pumpkin soup OTOH is lovely, with a few drops pumpkin oil, fab.
3292 2018-10-27 16:01:25 With tests so far indicating that KL4 and KL3 are most likely linked it means there is a huge oil pool with a vertical height of 358 feet.

3297 2018-10-27 15:59:59 Being anti oil has nothing to do with socialism. That's  an environmentalist. Allowing the government to control your money and what you are allowed to do is socialism.
3298 2018-10-27 15:59:58 SEPTA is looking ahead using the sun and the wind instead dirty coal and oil to power its trains, trolleys and buses. #LeadTheWay #renewableenergy #SEPTA
3299 2018-10-27 15:59:56 Oil prices will be higher for a while. So that #Saudi can pay blood money and bribe their way out of this crisis using our money.

When the world gets rid of its oil addiction, such dramas will end in Saudi & much of the Middle East.
3300 2018-10-27 15:59:51 Feet into a hot bath, bag of frozen peas at the back of your neck. Peppermint sauve or oil on temples and hairline.
3301 2018-10-27 15:59:30 Oh, I was thinking of the other side. It would upset three very large industries (automakers, trucking companies, and oil producers).
3302 2018-10-27 15:59:29 I would be careful with @jiffylube! I've had bad experiences there when going for an oil change. Make sure they change the oil. Also check to make sure they don't break anything. They broke off my support rod that keeps hood open. Found out after....
3303 2018-10-27 15:59:25 It's all about oil and weapons, Saudi has a ton of the former and buys a ton of the latter. As someone already pointed out, when it comes to money and wealth, why would our Government care about a pesky thing like millions starving to death..
3304 2018-10-27 15:59:24 The nuclear program of Pakistan was financed by many Arab countries, at that time due to fear of #Iraq and #Israel. So any attempt to hamper would bring retaliation from Arab world (Pakistan military retaliation would be negligible ) and that would be oil embargo, IMO

3318 2018-10-27 15:56:17 Three phases of the Saudi' oil fields.
1st The fields came with their own pressure to bring the oil to the surface.
2nd Pump Jack's to pump to surface.
Third phase: Huge pipes bring the saltwater to the wellheads to float the oil to the surface.
Several fields in late stage now.
3319 2018-10-27 15:56:16 Yessss!!! I literally cut all my daughters hair last year because she got lice I check her hair EVERY single morning before school and at night for bath time and thank god she hasn’t got them since  I recommend putting tea tree oil in her shampoo and conditioner
3320 2018-10-27 15:55:52 I don’t think it’s just the Oil companies - many politicians are also very supportive. It’s almost as if they (the politicians) have some sort of vested interest. Who would have thought ?
3321 2018-10-27 15:55:38 @duncantrussell I'm listening to you and Johnny Pemberton talk about fossil fuels and cars destroying the Earth. What if that oil was supposed to be there to keep the core going?
3322 2018-10-27 15:55:26 Sharks win 17-12. No oil painting, but right winners of final. WP lost their attack mojo significantly in KO phase of competition.

3324 2018-10-27 15:55:21 Hi, I’m very new to YL, and so truly impressed what essentials oils can do for you.  I have an order ready to go that’s over $100, but wondering, for an order over 100, are you sent a complementary oil with your order?
3325 2018-10-27 15:55:20 Really all this in Nigeria then Nigerians could be a cursed lot 
They should be doing more in African market than killing each other over oil fields
3326 2018-10-27 15:55:19 And when the international community continues to press them on this, #SaudiArabia will again change the story.  Apply sanctions till demands are met, fk their oil.
3327 2018-10-27 15:55:11 How can Carbon Tax cut transportation times? Electric cars in rural Canada and the territories? Job creation? Loss in oil field jobs and trucking. You city people have no idea. Canada pollutes a lot per capita not worst polluter. Carbon Tax is a tax grab. Will harm middle class.

3332 2018-10-27 15:54:45 1) We will probably need thousands of invisible heat transfer wells, instead of tens of thousands of ugly windmills.

2) Look at how the Alaska oil pipeline transports hot oil for 800 miles. One hot area in Oregon could power and heat that quadrant of the US.
3333 2018-10-27 15:54:44 Mine were too! I went our and bought some fresh mineral oil this past week. This morning I said to myself, Let’s do this!

3385 2018-10-26 23:55:36 Canada banned smoking in hospitals, schools, planes and other public areas because smoking is a public health issue. And raised taxes significantly to reduce consumption. Same argument could be made for oil.

3412 2018-10-26 23:50:26 George, do you drive a car, have a gas heater? Use electricity. Eat food. Wear clothes.  The energy and chemicals mostly derive from oil and gas. We import gas. 50% of our electricity is from gas. Why import at high cost when its extractable from below? We will need gas for 30yrs

3421 2018-10-26 23:49:08 And all the money that comes from the oil is in federal hands to be used in the future for our welfare programs when the economy collapses instead of using it to invest in other ways to make miney, so we can actually live when were out of oil

3428 2018-10-26 23:48:11 Nice .... But what I miss here is the smell ( original ) after applying  महेन्दी + महेन्दी oil @tapaasya
3429 2018-10-26 23:48:01 I wish I secreted flammable oil from my pore. So that when it’s could, I could just just set myself on fire.

3436 2018-10-26 23:47:18 Why the hell did I even become a nurse when you can get rid of literally any problem with the help of coconut oil???????
3437 2018-10-26 23:47:10 They are not trying to change anything. There are people hell bent on vengeance for everything America has done in the Middle East. And it was all for the sake of oil and big $$. The true Islam, not the radical bs, is about peace, brother/sisterhood and love.

3449 2018-10-26 23:44:38 Yeah leaf oil plus drizzle makes for a dangerous mix for metal wheels on steep metal track.  Ironically rails were bone dry and shiny tonight.
3450 2018-10-26 23:44:29 This is going to sound so basic but CBD oil cured my social anxiety and I would swear by it Ashley
3451 2018-10-26 23:44:27 "favourite political leader"... and in other news, oil has been discovered on the moon and Donald Trump has announced he's now a woman, making him the first female president of the USA.

Jog on, Jackie.
3452 2018-10-26 23:44:22 I used Cannabis oil to heal my eczema which cracked open my hand’s, my flesh was exposed. I had deep cut’s which kept breaking open. And using CBD and a salve with a little THC it saved my hand and helped give it a chance to heal. Not surprised either this plant is so versatile.

3457 2018-10-26 23:42:54 They could sharply reduce oil output... that might do it.
3458 2018-10-26 23:42:46 cbd oil! just a dropper a day. can put it in tea or whateva i just take it by itself
3459 2018-10-26 23:42:34 So land that is utilised for food production will be converted to growing palm oil for fuel!  Seems like a very short-sighted proposition and one that has proved to only benefit the rich who buy up the land. The disadvantages to this proposal far outweigh the advantages.
3460 2018-10-26 23:42:22 Energy drinks are for rookies, go and get yourself some good old school CRYSTAL METH.
3461 2018-10-26 23:42:11 Accidentally caught a bit of CNN earlier, & Van Jones would definitely attempt to humanize the people boiling him in oil as they lowered him into the vat. Pitiful how a network that so many are convinced is 'left-wing propaganda' goes out of its way to humanize the violent right.

3473 2018-10-26 23:39:35 Thanks @Grimhood only been a few days trying the Nigella sativa oil and Blue Lotus tea but I'm feeling better. I've made a few other changes too so hard to say exactly what helps - it all helps imo when making healthy choices.
3474 2018-10-26 23:39:14 So true. That's why I prefer digital myself.  But not many people make oil Kpop paintings so it might be cool to do if you're feeling it. 
3475 2018-10-26 23:39:14 That thing they arrested for the fake bombings, his van May of had a slight oil leak, EPA & CNN investigating.

3481 2018-10-26 23:38:24 I just hope it was @doTERRA oregano oil

3486 2018-10-26 23:37:47 He clearly has mental health problems. 98% of native's hate Trump and have history with him before he came president (to do with the casinos) and Trump signed off the oil pipe to go through Standing Rock! This is not a true image of who they are! They are peaceful/intelligent x

BoJo was asked why it wasn't a British one. So he responded by slating the quality and reliability of the British one.

Clearly, "the land of milk and honey" would never include British busses.

Snake oil salesman.
3496 2018-10-26 23:36:09 But not Alberta jobs, right @cathmckenna? I guarantee the oil & gas industry didn't get exemptions.
3497 2018-10-26 23:35:47 Let's be honest, you guys are guilty of this too. When Dubya was in office, the liberal narrative would often change between him being either an evil mastermind who used a war in the middle east as a diversion for stealing oil or a drooling idiot. It's either one or the other.

3500 2018-10-26 23:34:51 @CommodityMD Thank you for writing Oil 101. Have enjoyed what I have read so far. Is there a kindle, PDF, or ePub version of the book? I travel enough where carrying hardcover books can be cumbersome.

3509 2018-10-26 23:33:04 Yeah, but dad lives two hours from you, not five minutes. Swear he’s going to cut me off from oil changes soon 
3510 2018-10-26 23:32:59 Made a kelp (seaweed) & cucumber mask with a drop of geranium EO & a little 1tsp avocado oil ... Not going on retreat due to incoming  n'orEaster.
3511 2018-10-26 23:32:47 Genuinely curious as to how much of these recent #Tesla investigations are potentially tied to the oil industry. #whokilledtheelectriccar
3512 2018-10-26 23:32:28 Why did I an oil tanker just try to RACE me on 202... I need him to put down the crack pipe like right fucking now
3513 2018-10-26 23:32:27 Somehow I accidentally left a cookie in both my purse and the bag I take to work and now every time I pull something out of either one an array of cookies crumbs comes flying out. And everything is sticky. And soaked in cookie oil.

3515 2018-10-26 23:31:54 My boss asked me to put some essence oil in the oil burner and after I did I put a drop in my hand and put it in my hair because why not it smelled nice 

he really said "You need to stop acting like grandmas lol" Dude is 35 and completely bald but I ain't say shit
3516 2018-10-26 23:31:43 Yeah I grew up using coconut oil for hair and skin. One didn't really cook with it. Folks think it sounds healthier but no real science behind it
3517 2018-10-26 23:31:38 I hope Canadian business responds positively. Then, of course, there are industries like oil and gas that want to diversify but are stymied by the muddled approach to #pipeline approvals in Canada. Until the price differential collapsed energy was our most valuable export.
3518 2018-10-26 23:31:37 Its not big oil that wants yo block this initiative. It’s the citizens of this state!!
3519 2018-10-26 23:31:27 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, but – and who we are fighting for.
3520 2018-10-26 23:31:08 You had an opportunity to build refineries.
But instead you decided to strangle the oil and gas industries and put hundreds of thousands of workers.
Now you want us to believe your pro oil!!
Screw you and your party!

3521 2018-10-26 23:31:00 O Rourke voting for a tax hike on oil and voting against any tax breaks for hurricane Harveys victims is a bit odd for some one running for a Senate seat.

3524 2018-10-26 23:30:10 Viscosity of that fluid can be found  by consulting a medical doctor i thinks , since is not an engine oil  any one can help
3525 2018-10-26 23:30:05 Their fair share. But their liability, which requires a (int’l) political solution, does not abscond the liability of our oil majors for the damage they’ve caused
3526 2018-10-26 23:30:01 CCI Canadian Crude Index close for Oct 26th $28.73 US/bbl +$0.30 +1.06% #CCI #CanadianCrudeOil #CDNCRUDE #Oil #CCXETF $USO $DBO $OIL $UCCO
3527 2018-10-26 23:29:54 Hence the need for improved technology. We have the technology right here today to replace all carbon-based energy use on Earth. We simply don't because powers that be are too invested in profiteering off continued oil/gas misuse.
3528 2018-10-26 23:29:52 Coconut oil isn't a healthy choice to cook with
3529 2018-10-26 23:29:37 Absolutely.  Massive game that I hope Von is up for.  He put the team on his back last week and had results.  Did you make it to the Oil game after?
3530 2018-10-26 23:29:37 I'm on a diet so spray a bit of lo cal olive oil over then paprika or garlic salt then pop in a really hot oven. Great for watching calories and they taste great.
3531 2018-10-26 23:29:24 It wasn’t ricin but it was widely reported. Did Fox not cover it?  Anyway, it died down when it tested to be ground-up castor beans. Could’ve been turned into ricin or castor oil.
3532 2018-10-26 23:29:20 TY 
3533 2018-10-26 23:29:11 I love this Raw Shea butter and coca butter body oil 
3534 2018-10-26 23:28:20 Excellent choice! Always good to avoid Earl Grey Tea, Lady Grey Tea, and all tea flavoured with oil of Bergamot.
3535 2018-10-26 23:27:59 Crazy? Am i? Too many things dont make the slightest bit of sense.our best minds here have come up with shit thats wrong for everyone but the few at the top. Oil, money, and drugs govern the planet.follow the dollar.hillary is owned.trump isnt owned. Conflict.simple.
3536 2018-10-26 23:27:21 Might just buy it anyway. Who tf needs an oil change lol
3537 2018-10-26 23:27:17 @Nestle also uses palm oil in their products.
3538 2018-10-26 23:27:04 yes!  I've been saying that oil by rail was hurting farmers for awhile now.

3545 2018-10-26 23:25:03 I took black seed oil orally today and it wasn't too bad but you definitely have to mix it with ALOT of honey.
3546 2018-10-26 23:25:03 @HeathONeill big win for the oil last night! Now let’s hope our Broncos put forth the same sort of effort in KC. After all the distractions this week, I hope they prove everyone wrong. The season is riding on this game.

3550 2018-10-26 23:24:41 I would be  interested to know how many of the social justice warriors mewling about this have eaten intensively raised chicken, used beauty products containing palm oil or eaten brassicas sprayed with insecticides in the last month? Any that have should look closer to home!
3551 2018-10-26 23:24:37 @Louis_Tomlinson babe try an avocado toast with some tomatoes and olive oil and salt and pepper it’ll change ur life
3552 2018-10-26 23:24:22 Esta sobre la Ruta 9 al lado de OIL. ALTURA HOSPITAL DE PACHECO.... DE QUIEN ES???
3553 2018-10-26 23:24:13 Lmaoo I'm doing that now because I wanted to see clips too. I'm watching people trying to climb stairs covered in oil, in suits covered in oil....STAIRS 
3554 2018-10-26 23:24:10 Historically, the triggering of economic downturns coincide with giving unruly citizens a jerk on the chain so to speak. the price rise in oil is the fastest trigger for economic downturns and the raising of interest rates as well.  Everyone should just remain calm..most of us
3555 2018-10-26 23:24:06 No because the EU can’t let that happen there will be talk and maybe no Arms deals, they will just buy from China and the like, but anything with real teeth won’t happen as EU relies to much on KSA money not just oil
3556 2018-10-26 23:24:00 So we fixed my head gasket and then we came back to change the oil— my brake lines have a leak. I can’t win. I give up. The lord doesn’t want me to have a vehicle.

3558 2018-10-26 23:23:34 Is that development and  control of most of the markets world wide through threats and lies? You know corrupted industries such as old oil, old banking and old military, and certain corrupt tech companies with corrupt politicians.
3559 2018-10-26 23:23:27 Like Trump is Hitler? 
I hate whataboutism,  but I dont need lecturing about civility from people who have for two years equated Trump and supporters as Fascists and existential threats to the country.
3560 2018-10-26 23:23:22 I wanted to read the book abt how the Gettys poisoned the Osage for their oil but the tone is so bodice-ripper, it's unreadable.
3561 2018-10-26 23:23:18 If FF are ultimately priced out of the market, the big generators and oil companies will find a way to fill the gap. They might even dig up some of the patents they sat on for the past couple of decades.

3566 2018-10-26 23:22:18 I'm new to oil and just watching USO for now.  I see the systematic repeated down pattern the last few weeks and historically, uso has gone up early Nov for winter oil season. I was guessing the price would go up soon and continue up into Dec. Accurate? No?
3567 2018-10-26 23:21:56 @RickiLake loved your interview with @jennyhutt

3570 2018-10-26 23:21:11 Exactly!! Lets not get our Canadian Oil to market, instead we can sell it to the US at $0.50 on the dollar and keep importing Saudi oil

3577 2018-10-26 23:20:26 The facts already are a matter of public record. One is surprisingly missing from that record:  Why has no one investigated the joint venture between putin, et al, & trump, et al, investing in oil rich Russian land? Look up news stories in 2016 & early 2017.

3583 2018-10-26 23:20:04 Wow, we're did you come up with that. Our stock market has lagged way behind the US, our GDP IS down. We got kicked in the ass on the new trade deal. Our oil and gas sector is being decimated, will the rest of the world goes cruising on down the highway.
3584 2018-10-26 23:20:00 Twitter, Facebook, and Google are too big of a monopoly.  The same that was big oil and Ma/Bell should be done here.  Force them to split up.
3585 2018-10-26 23:19:48 In addition to prayer & Bible study, you might add Omega III fatty acids (fish oil) and exercise.  The first provides the building blocks for the neurotransmitters  setatonin and dopamine and the later increase production of both helping you feel better.  Ask your doctor.

3603 2018-10-26 23:17:34 Except it can't. An independent Scotland's fiscal premise is lower than Greece's, and a major flaw in the EU rationale is every European economy is the same. We all have oil, we all grow oranges, we all have 7 hrs daylight in December etc.
It doesn't fly.

3615 2018-10-26 23:15:50 Venezuela is leaning heavily on new investments from China saying it will dramatically boost oil production. China also owns the largest port in Panama and IMO has every reason to incite and finance the Million Migrant March while domestic actors provide equipment and logistics.

3619 2018-10-26 23:15:31 Where public policy is increasingly based on half-baked ideas and ill-informed opinions, perhaps the fear of small tremors and oil spills are a means to an end. Tangible, rather than abstract. But personally, I'd rather see rational discourse and fact-based decision making.
3620 2018-10-26 23:15:26 Rise of oil price leads to inflations inflation leads to higher cost of goods and rise of interest hikes which interns leads to a financial crisis. They just don't want to say it yet to avoid panic.

3642 2018-10-26 23:13:43 While your government is part of this holy war not all Palestinians are pro hamas. This denies you are in a war for a self defense. You are turning this war to against muslims. not just hamas. Terrorism will thrive. You are pouring oil on that fire.

3650 2018-10-26 23:12:56 The oil industry is the top contributor to Gov. Jack Dalrymple, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics, and gave money in all but 10 of the 75 legislative races held in 2012.
3651 2018-10-26 23:12:37 All are to be apply in this kind of flow 
3652 2018-10-26 23:12:32 If only the govt went after big oil like they go after cigs. 
We might be leading the world in renewables now instead of working on destroying the entire planet to line a few billionaires pockets.
3653 2018-10-26 23:12:29 Turmeric consists of the dried and cured rhizomes of Curcuma longa Linn. It mainly contains essential oil and curcumin. It is bitter, and pungent in taste, pungent after digestion, and is hot in effect. It is Ruksha in quality.
3654 2018-10-26 23:12:24 Interesting argument. I'm not so sure. Is it a distraction from the bigger picture? Perhaps it is a necessary way to make consequences more "real" in people's minds. Opposition to oil pipelines focuses on spills, but it is the oil that is NOT spilled that poses a greater threat.
3655 2018-10-26 23:11:43 A guy spilled olive oil on the back of my shirt and acted like it was all good. When I got home realized the shirt was obviously ruined. I respected his decision
3656 2018-10-26 23:11:28 US markets down while oil very marginally up with modest bounce in volumes.  Iran sanctions in Nov propping it up.  Buy the rumor sell the fact?! #markets
3657 2018-10-26 23:11:26 Is this b/c Brazil signed a bunch of oil deals with China?
3658 2018-10-26 23:11:18 I didn't have an issue because of humidity, so I guess it worked for that. We got it for the oil cooling, gets a bit hot on 9200 running fan and down pressure from 1 pump.
3659 2018-10-26 23:11:08 I've seen this stupid talking point hundreds of times.  Venezuela was influenced by a lack of oil prices and reliance on foreign currency.  Stop trying to brand that as socialism. #ableg #abpolie #cdnpoli

3665 2018-10-26 23:10:26 Makes sense, I have to turn my push mower on its side to get all the oil out! 
3666 2018-10-26 23:10:26 There were been multiple shortcomings and widely had been seen in the past from the oil companies in #Pakistan but where are the oil regulator authority to control over the recent oil spillage alongside the “KARCHI” oceans sham shame @pid_gov
3667 2018-10-26 23:10:22 Hess's Russian unit.  Yukos. 
But @mopeng said that
This is fun:
Hess is one of the most active companies in the lucrative Bakken shale of North Dakota, a region which is at the heart of the most recent US oil boom.
3668 2018-10-26 23:10:17 I'd visit you with your permission of course. I'd bring Greek Baked Goods if you invite me to your home as how do you refer to it as an open house. But Alas I'm stuck in Detroit. I wonder if my car can make the road trip. I'd need to change the oil at least.
3669 2018-10-26 23:10:15 To be a good Mexican dad you have to know how to change oil

3689 2018-10-26 23:08:06 ありがとうございます！

3690 2018-10-26 23:08:02 Blame #IsIS and have a bipartisan actual effort go in and clean up shop and say no to dirty oil money and cruel taxation. #ISIS is a joke. Quit the malarkey. @USHouseNews
3691 2018-10-26 23:07:52 The place I go to get my nails done for my pedicure starts with a mud mask then apricot scrub then honey then oil then EVOO lotion and honestly I think they’re trying to cook my legs but it’s amazing
3692 2018-10-26 23:07:52 Why is that important? Ukraine and the pill under the Black Sea is a pet project for the Council. Securing the oil from Russian control is one of their main thrusts. Just saying...
3693 2018-10-26 23:07:46 Feeling pretty accomplished as I pulled the cracked oil pan from my car, and swapped it out in less than an hour. Pretty neat today
3694 2018-10-26 23:07:46 @AndrewGillum When we legalize recreational Marijuana, add 10% tax to everyone without a Florida ID, give that money out to permanant residents of that county the marijuana was sold, like oil revenues in Alaska, but county based.
3695 2018-10-26 23:07:46 Ore- Onile go change Oil abi?
3696 2018-10-26 23:07:42 前回ってわからないことばかりで順位気にしてなかったのですが何位でしたの？教えていろんな本好きなマスター∩˙▿˙∩
3697 2018-10-26 23:07:40 I forgot how good argan oil is for silky hair. #MyManeIsSoSoftToday #Lioness
3698 2018-10-26 23:07:38 Don’t windmills and solar panels take less energy to produce than nuclear. Building nuclear with energy from oil is like enabling a gambler. Even if we did get lots of clean nuclear, demand for energy might increase. A foolproof way to reduce GHG emissions is by shrinking big oil
3699 2018-10-26 23:07:34 At what cost tho? Alberta is already in rough shape, while the other oil bearing states in the US is booming. Not to mention you can tax to oblivion but it will only make fractions of a percent to global carbon emissions.
3700 2018-10-26 23:07:28 My oil change is literally long over due ... finally getting around to doing it my Poor little car hasn’t let me down idk why I’ve waited so long
3701 2018-10-26 23:07:23 우왕 이제 여유있는 삶을 살겠군 축하해 완성본 보고싶다
3702 2018-10-26 23:07:06 This is because of climate change we need to make serious change and run coal and oil out of business!
3703 2018-10-26 23:07:05 Are your drives oil bath or dry?

3705 2018-10-26 23:06:49 This tea tree oil and bio oil got my face looking like BITCH WHAT ACNE
3706 2018-10-26 23:06:49 Bought an oil pen today it was the best/worse decision I made 
3707 2018-10-26 23:06:37 Correction I was taking about people standing in the road protesting the oil pipeline for the Standing rock tribal lands. don’t be an asshole and think you know what I’m talking about. The exact words were: these liberals think it’s ok to make me late for work, I’d run them over
3708 2018-10-26 23:06:35 So anybody still pregnant & ready to have they baby wanna take shots of castor oil with me 
3709 2018-10-26 23:06:25 your wcw can’t change a tire, check her oil or tire pressure 
3710 2018-10-26 23:06:20 It would be the equivalent of putting a tax on plastic. Which would not only curb plastic waste, but encourage innovation towards making better, more biodegradable products that could replace common plastic items on large scale (plastic also being dependent on oil).
3711 2018-10-26 23:06:19 changing the oil on my car always makes me feel way more responsible than I actually am
3712 2018-10-26 23:06:16 This, and getting on with our own oil.
3713 2018-10-26 23:05:50 I think the mail thing is a take on the humility of some USPS offices and who they have come to work with. Hint) they control your employment. They control things insane like your digestive system. They control your taxes. They’re big on oil $$. #Terrorists @benshapiro @USPS

3715 2018-10-26 23:05:36 Bros, most Nigerians are naive. Oil prices were high, we were meant to practice inclusive economy towards development, but nope PDP were looting the money among the minority few & claim our economy was growing. Not everybody is an educated illiterate ńa, some of us understand...
3716 2018-10-26 23:05:29 "Industry Giant 2" kind of like sim city, but ONLY for the infrastructure. 
As in all the businesses required to mine ore, make metal ingots, mae metals, drill oil, make rubber and then use both to make a bicycle to then sell in your shops.
3717 2018-10-26 23:05:14 It's as u judgemental it can be - nothing wrong in selling God given oil. Arabs do it too. They thump their Quran. Texans thump their Bible. They have the liberty to do so. Nothing wrong with that too.
3718 2018-10-26 23:04:58 Have you ever made cabbage in the oven with some olive oil and sea salt omg if not slice that bitch and put it on a cookie sheet for 20 min at 350 and it is BOMB
3719 2018-10-26 23:04:26 You ever just drink canola oil from the bottle?
3720 2018-10-26 23:04:22 I'm use people putting fish oil in my food that's why I'm not eating with y'all niggas. #999
3721 2018-10-26 23:04:20 Im fresh and clean and my hair is beautiful and soft and flowy again
Thank you jesus and god and hair oil
3722 2018-10-26 23:04:13 I wasn’t looking at the New Zealand candies than looked at my stomach than said “you need the oil more” lmao
3723 2018-10-26 23:03:54 “i’m gonna get home and soak my hair in oil and wash it finally”
me, upon getting home: sits on bed for an hour scrolling
3724 2018-10-26 23:03:36 Right? It’s a set of skills that has been largely lost in the post-oil-boom just-buy-it-at-Walmart era and there’s lots of room for subversiveness, plus the 7th graders would be stoked bc it would be their eating-and-moving-around part of the day (plus Ms. Romer is the funnest)
3725 2018-10-26 23:03:30 Last night at 2am I decided to fry garlic and oil add peas broccoli and salsa and boil it... add creamy garlic dressing to my dunkin hamm egg and cheese on english muffin and melt shredded cheese to my hashbrown... not sure if drunk Andrew enjoyed it... #ToccsTopics

3727 2018-10-26 23:03:12 @JonahMarais what phone are you using to take pictures of your food because when I take pictures of mine it literally reflects the production stage and every bit of oil imaginable
3728 2018-10-26 23:03:05 In my day we'd go after the country of the people who attacked us. Should we wage a campaign against Florida? Kidding. We never actually went after the people who attacked us. We mercilessly destroyed other countries in the name of self defense. Somehow. Oil. It was all for oil.
3729 2018-10-26 23:02:57 maybe it’s just the brand I’ve been using but coconut oil makes my face break out 
3730 2018-10-26 23:02:55 Brakes ,Oil change, tune up, LED, HID, Color shift halos, neon underglow, screens subs, amps any of that hml
3731 2018-10-26 23:02:34 Muldoon was bad for the economy with the interventionist strategies he used. Govt by regulation - wage freeze, labour laws, price control, the oil shock & carless days are examples. Working in industry I saw that we couldn't even get overtime because govt had regulated against it
3732 2018-10-26 23:02:17 I'm 2014, Nigeria was the fastest growing economy in Africa, but we plunged into recession in less than 18mnths after. If we were actually developing, we would never had experienced recession cos of drop in oil prices. We don't want growth, we want development.
3733 2018-10-26 23:02:12 It’s reported that #Qatar paid ransom to #TERRORIST ORGANIZATION for release of Japanese journalist.
This Qatarish action certainly endanger Japanese as arrested by terrorist. I BELIEVE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT SHOULD CONDUCT #EcomonicSanction TO QATAR such as EMBARGO OF OIL.

3736 2018-10-26 23:02:06 And the next day oil was discovered and now the land is for sale to highest bidder. How is this news? Must’ve been McConnell’s ideal.

3738 2018-10-26 23:01:58 What Oil? Exploration that was conducted found no commercial viable areas. Just political Fakery trying to incite your base.
3739 2018-10-26 23:01:49 My dad didn’t take his Rick Simpson oil and the cancer beat him. My father in law took all of his and he is now alive and healthy 2 years later. Not saying it’s guaranteed but it does have a lot of good reports behind it.

3744 2018-10-26 23:01:25 Google says a) coconut oil b) petroleum jelly for eyebrows c) baby oil d) cold cream cleanser
Not sure if you tried oil based makeup remover
And if you still can’t get rid of it I would  contact owner of the makeup. Tou got ot done at school right? It wasn’t ypurs?
3745 2018-10-26 23:01:23 the oil in my pen is reggie concentrate
3746 2018-10-26 23:01:19 Thanks Faisal. I am learning. Does Saudi Arabia also have the trees that are used to collect the sap and turned into frankensense oil? I know Oman has those trees. Ya'll have some of the most awesome landscape and architecture in the world. Old architectural and new. Amazing.
3747 2018-10-26 23:01:18 Lots of oil in Fort McMurray . It's in Alberta . Alberta is in Canada
What a twit.

3749 2018-10-26 23:01:06 oil pull: swish coconut around your mouth for 15-20 minutes every day. You will see hella results. 
brush your teeth with activated charcoal 2-3 times a week. This works wonders. 
wear your retainer if you have one!!
try to floss every day! 
brush your teeth 2x a day

3751 2018-10-26 23:00:56 My body is covered in coconut oil, I detox once a month, no pork - no cow's milk, shying away from red meat, and I exercise regularly so I don't have time for no nigga with McDonald's dick and Newport & Henny sperm
3752 2018-10-26 23:00:42 Sauted with garlic and olive oil...or in a stew of white beans and sausage...YUM!
3753 2018-10-26 23:00:39 you can put any essential oil in it! i want to try them all.
3754 2018-10-26 23:00:35 Saw gas prices today in San Diego at $5.00 / gallon.

I guess Donald’s deal making abilities are exceptional with the Saudi’s for our oil imports...

Well done Donald!

3759 2018-10-26 22:59:38 Where dobyou think all the deepwater horizen oil from the spill went.
3760 2018-10-26 22:59:36 Kai engineer, wAtoh aquifer, is the flow laminar or turbulent, are we going to apply chezy, mani or Bernoulli's principle here 
3761 2018-10-26 22:59:31 You amuse me a great deal. Even the blind is aware of the the fact that,  corruption in Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari is not only frightening but is now attaining unprecedented heights of audacious impunity never before seen in the leadership of the oil rich nation
3762 2018-10-26 22:59:26 Yet 99.99999% of our “everyday” population still travel on fuel-powered jets, receive amazon deliveries on fuel-powered vehicles (for products imported via fuel-powered ships), and heat their homes with fuel-fired burners. Oil will remain relevant for at least another 50+ years.
3763 2018-10-26 22:59:06 Marathon Oil! When I was at SBU as an undergrad we played the Upstate NY AAU All-Stars coaches by a guy in Syracuse.
3764 2018-10-26 22:59:01 I need an oil change 
3765 2018-10-26 22:58:56 On each end of the header there is a drive chain with two different size sprockets. Our yours bolted (oil drive) covers or can you push them down and off?
3766 2018-10-26 22:58:53 Its a mix. We have a capitalist economy, but also socialist welfare programs that feed of our oil and fish based economy.

Aka "the nordic model"

3769 2018-10-26 22:58:37 Iran needs a genius to get its oil investments work well with the US sanctions.  An almost impossible task.
3770 2018-10-26 22:58:30 I don’t agree with Nintendo 

*Puts on some sunglasses*
Where is a third world country with oil
3771 2018-10-26 22:58:25 The woman say she use the coconut oil in her hair. That's fine. She went on to say how she uses it to brush her teeth and drinks a teaspoon every morning. Nooo woman! Yo doing too much!
3772 2018-10-26 22:58:24 Go and invest in agriculture so we can stop depending on oil, said the government.
Nigerians heed the clarion call. Boom! Fulani herdsmen wouldn’t let the farms and farmers be productive.
3773 2018-10-26 22:58:18 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
3774 2018-10-26 22:57:59 Did I say that? Nothing wrong in enjoying God given wealth. Arabs simply sit there and get money selling oil - so do Texans. I just happen to put people who are inventive and create new solutions to make money at a higher pedastal. I respect them more.
3775 2018-10-26 22:57:51 Yes. But cutting off Saudi oil to US wouldn’t hurt their economy much (or ours, for that matter), which doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be done. I gather weapons contracts might be more crucial to them.
3776 2018-10-26 22:57:47 Hair is dry, I should oil it up before I sleep
3777 2018-10-26 22:57:37 Who did the damage?  Ka haye ruwan cikinta with your drilling machine, pump water and change her level from aquifer to surface you are still expecting her to look the same, mugunta kenan.
3778 2018-10-26 22:57:37 Liberal ties to George Soros, Tom Steyer, Tides Foundation and  illegal funding in our elections are well known. Libs helped them kill our pipeline projects to continue oil by rail.
Needless to say those guys make lots of $, they own most of tanker cars in NA.

At least he expected such an outcome in due time...
3784 2018-10-26 22:56:44 Finally listened to the last episode.  That was interesting.  I'm looking forward to your comparison of the oil and the med.

3794 2018-10-26 22:55:26 I need a smart car. One that can change its own oil, rotate its own tires,  replace its own brakes, etc.
3795 2018-10-26 22:55:18 My family still says I’m being attacked by demons because I am not on the “right path”. They say I choose not to fight them. I try to tell them, “hey, no I’m sick” and they respond by trying to pour oil down my head for a spiritual cleaning.
3796 2018-10-26 22:54:34 I wonder if we would be in constant wars in the middle east if they had 1/3 of the world's broccoli instead of having 1/3 of the worlds oil. 
3797 2018-10-26 22:53:56 most of public resources already are controlled by them,Oil,spectrum is with Ambani, Mining is with Adani,water, forests, land are distributed on demand to all, primarily required by FMCG tycoon Ramdev.Electricity distribution and sea ports Adani.This nation will soon rot in hell
3798 2018-10-26 22:53:55 Jstclair:"How many villages in Central America has this US barged into, taken what  it’s corporations wanted–oil, fruit, copper–and left behind nothing but  toxic waste pits and graves full of peasants?"

3800 2018-10-26 22:53:49 That is true, but the Saudis and the UAE have a lot of stuff.  It is more the pipeline to circumvent having to ship oil through the strait.

3804 2018-10-26 22:53:07 So with the cost difference between Saudi oil and Canadian oil, how many days would it take to pay the penalty? ....if Coderre and his Liberal cronies hadn’t killed Energy East?

3806 2018-10-26 22:52:52 Perfectly poised to become a widely beloved figure? She is batshit crazy!!!
3807 2018-10-26 22:52:48 The prospect may yield as many as 150 million barrels of oil, which would be transported to land via a subsea pipeline. BP still retains a 50 percent stake in the Liberty project, but following its more than $20 billion settlement for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, (2)

3810 2018-10-26 22:52:37 Carlin uses humor and confident speaking to garner ethos whereas Klein uses real examples of careless planning that have led to disaster (BP oil spill, recession, tar sands). #Flamm101

3814 2018-10-26 22:52:13 Texans should think twice about electing a socialist, pro abortionist, anti God candidate. Surely they don't want the government coming in seizing all that land, the oil wells, cattle & money. It would be a real shame to dump your life in the hands of an anti, hating American.

3818 2018-10-26 22:51:58 The third was the Liberty prospect, located 5.5 miles offshore in federal waters. To develop the Liberty prospect, Hilcorp has proposed to construct an artificial gravel island on the site and then drill from the island down into the oil field. (1)
3819 2018-10-26 22:51:54 THE BIGGEST SCAM IN NIGERIA’S OIL INDUSTRY
Diezani Alison-madueke n her 200+ accomplices were charged with the biggest oil fraud in the history of Nigeria. Over $50bn was lost n not accounted for since 2011 till 2015, this alone is enough to plunge Africa’s biggest economy into..

3830 2018-10-26 22:50:09 Premier oil had a 14-23% short pos range at one point... Sp was 42.75....I was long at 43.75 and (although I didn't hold everything out, only traded swings), the sp is now 103....spiked 147 a mnth ago... Shorters can get burnt... Now only has a 2-3% range short..
3831 2018-10-26 22:50:08 I'm old enough to remember George Bush stealing an election in Florida, then starting a war for oil that killed thousands of American soldiers and crippled tens of thousands more.
3832 2018-10-26 22:50:06 what kind of oil ?
3833 2018-10-26 22:49:59 Truth is,  we have squeaky  wheels in both parties that  get the oil.
Loose  nuts are held responsible  for  civil disobedience. 
The rest of us defend our principles and VOTE.
We all have the right to our opinions, and should defend them in civility. 
Being angry  is cathartic
3834 2018-10-26 22:49:40 My near light in my future is Alberta’s provincial election NXT yr to @jkenney and a monumental Cdn unification to put out Federal liberals in power. Our future in Ag/Oil&gas and a strong nation in serious jeopardy if these policies continue to inflict on r Cdn economies!
3835 2018-10-26 22:49:31 It used to but when I started adding a oil it stopped, most white products do that to me
3836 2018-10-26 22:49:31 Thats awsome and it happened between 60th and 76th not 68th and 76th , because Rays oil change is north of 68th by the m6 over pass

when a genius markets technology that will fundamentally change the planet for the better and hurt the oil industry the oil industry starts calling on the Govt they paid a lot of money for to slow him down

Did I get it, was that the answer
3868 2018-10-26 22:45:56 There’s only one party. It’s the party the oil companies are having while making up more crazy shit for the media to tell the public.

3877 2018-10-26 22:44:04 yes, during the 2015 election. every party projected huge deficits in 2015, mainly due to the drop in oil prices. the imp issue is the huge deficit today, and projected deficits in 2019 and beyond, and parties' plans to address it

3888 2018-10-26 22:41:22 Not if the raw material for the product was shipped from NA to China and the product shipped back again. Ships burn heavy unprocessed oil. We need to add the carbon footprint products like we do with nutrition content
3889 2018-10-26 22:41:16 So andy you telling us you would tax the crap out of the oil industry? After all they are the only reason we have to pay the carbon tax in the first place.
Shut down oil and we only lose 5% of the economy and will never have to do anything else to reach our commitments.
3890 2018-10-26 22:41:02 And just like oil if used all the time in the same ole fashion it can be taken for granted...if it runs short the price goes up, everyone is on alert & wants it...oh, and oils have an expiry date after which the performance levels that they offer can no longer be guaranteed
3891 2018-10-26 22:40:59 @DailyZeitgeist  Mayonnaise is eggs and oil. So mayonnaise in a cake sounds like a good idea.
3892 2018-10-26 22:40:55 ずすん
3893 2018-10-26 22:40:45 But an oil company can delete the comments a person puts on there Facebook page or twitter or Instagram if they have such things. And if someone wants to stand outside Facebook or twitter's offices and protest they can. It's comparing apples to oranges.

They are, owned by a right-wing Conservative family who is deeply invested in oil and industrial manufacturing, and they tow the party line often. If even they think this is nonsense, perhaps you should consider yourself the extremist.
3963 2018-10-26 22:28:01 Honestly Tesla is threat to them! It's the next generation wave that will eliminate oil. Tesla ain't going no where.
3964 2018-10-26 22:27:43 Know how to change oil too
3965 2018-10-26 22:27:36 Peace of mind

Oil ooooooo
3966 2018-10-26 22:27:33 I was strongly going to Texas Tech to major in petroleum engineering until the fateful day in 1988 when my dad told me the oil and gas industry was dying #hurtstomissthatone
3967 2018-10-26 22:27:30 No problem, you don’t think he has the answers.
I was only prompted to jump in these tweets in response to how it was framed being flawed.
We don’t have an economy dependent on oil tied to another countries currency for starters.
3968 2018-10-26 22:27:29 Lol I literally had no oil in my car and when I pulled up to Jiffy Lube the guy made them put a quart of oil in my car before they even moved it into the garage lmaoooo I was almost fucked...
3969 2018-10-26 22:27:18 Lawrence, Babe....drink some black tea with honey. Lots of it. And maybe get down some noodle soup. Get some organic lavender oil and put a drop on each temple and on your forehead
We miss you!!!
3970 2018-10-26 22:26:39 He also knocked the first part of the Berlin Wall down, helped discover the North Sea oil fields, performed the first heart transplant and is on the cusp of curing cancer. The man is a Saint....

3973 2018-10-26 22:26:30 I hate to tell you mate. The USA is a socialist country. If you're a banker, an arms dealer or an oil baron, the government will furnish you with public money all day long...
3974 2018-10-26 22:26:15 yeah at that dominos they used to cook the chicken in same oil as non-halal meat so I think that’s why 
3975 2018-10-26 22:26:12 If I told him he would be like oh I can fix that it’s so simple haha he did that last night and it was all simple I’m like how would I know ! Lmao I only know how to do oil and fluid for windows lmao
3976 2018-10-26 22:26:00 Very grateful for your reply. Indeed, it is a complex story, but I did not state my thesis clearly. Too much for a Tweet, but murdering journalists is offset by our need of their very generous defense contracts. So, if they had no oil $, we would not need them. Petropolitics 101.
3977 2018-10-26 22:25:57 And how many years have you worked in the oil patch? How many acres of SAGD are included in this?
3978 2018-10-26 22:25:40 I keep forgetting that I've changed my body oil scent from sweet orange to lavender (because it's Autumn now) and this evening I keep getting lovely wafts of lavender.

3980 2018-10-26 22:24:39 I love burning the midnight oil studying, working, partying, talking to or even texting people. Daytime for me is zombie mode all the time
3981 2018-10-26 22:24:35 Washed my car and got an oil change! Yes my car is a happy car 
3982 2018-10-26 22:24:27 The oil valve for cheap Iraq oil to Europe is in Turkey. Turkey could shut in cheap oil to Europe causing Brent Oil to soar. Ankara needs a U.S. waiver to continue buying Iranian oil but not Iraq oil.
3983 2018-10-26 22:24:04 Old Hugh sold a lot of snake oil early on, but he forgot to sneak his wagon out of town before dark. He's stuck. So, down the rabbit hole he goes with the rest of the conspirators.
3984 2018-10-26 22:24:00 Castor beans are not ricin.
They are used in many things, including food and medicinal areas. 
Castor beans are not ricin, anymore than they are castor oil. 

A potato is not a french fry, potato chip, or vodka.

3986 2018-10-26 22:23:34 What about required disclosure and reporting of dark money or corporate cash influencing Colorado elections?

Westword reported Noble Energy (oil and gas/fracking company) is spending around $10 million to defeat safer setbacks (112).

Under the radar but Williams doing nothing.
3987 2018-10-26 22:23:27 I still don't get 'extra virgin olive oil'.  How can it be extra virgin?  "Olive oil is so virgin,  it's made with cherries".
3988 2018-10-26 22:23:25 Just came to get my front tire changed & Troy at Goodyear just gave me a free oil change because he said that my Lyft/Uber is the most hooked up ride he has ever seen... I just like to make prefect strangers SMILE!!  
Get in my Car , I Got Candy!!
3989 2018-10-26 22:23:07 Definitely make sure the area you apply it is freshly shaved & free from dirt & oil.  When you apply it, be sure to press it firmly and count to ten.  That should help it stay on.  Sticking it back on if it falls off?  Probably no harm in that.  But consult your doctor to be sure
3990 2018-10-26 22:23:03 And how many sailors died to keep people fed - you utter and total cretin. My mother watched torpedoed merchant sailors jump into burning oil in the Atlantic in 1944.

3994 2018-10-26 22:22:30 Can patchouli sweat be used as engine oil?
3995 2018-10-26 22:22:12 Slightly more hipster places use aioli rather than mayo. Typically the mayo goes on the side of the salad, since the bacon doesn't need any more oil added to it.

3998 2018-10-26 22:21:58 “The U.S. has been putting pressure on Iraq to suspend shipments of oil to Iran and to resume Kurdish oil flows towards Turkey. If Turkey gets more oil from Iraq, it will be more difficult for Ankara to argue it needs a U.S. waiver to continue buying Iranian oil

4013 2018-10-26 22:18:34 I had the same question but forgot to ask. Hey @ColoradoSun or @gracehood , is the spending from oil and gas on 112 the highest ever in CO for a ballot initiative? Like, where does this level of spending rank in CO history?
4014 2018-10-26 22:18:33 If the US wasn’t in the Persian Gulf, oil wouldn’t leave the Arabian Sea and the ME economy would collapse. US presence is sanctioned by a defense pact w/ Kuwait. Until Iran is capable of securing such a pact with Florida they would be engaging in an act of war if in our waters.

4016 2018-10-26 22:18:22 You give Americans too much credit. One  has only to look to the horrific bias of the American State Dept. over many decades. It was always about the oil.
4017 2018-10-26 22:18:14 In other news, Mr. Jamal Kashoggi is still dead and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia is enjoying the high life that his oil blood money brings.

4019 2018-10-26 22:18:10 You made my point for me. This government chooses to finance oil wars instead of these services back home. We see poverty because our government has SOLD US OUT. Donny McPresident has simply lied to us in a way some believe he’s not more of the wealthy elites that steal from us.

4026 2018-10-26 22:16:57 @WBrettWilson can the US buy Canadian oil and sell it overseas for twice the price?
4027 2018-10-26 22:16:52 Demand will not drop fast enough. If we want to stay below 2 degrees C of warming, supply must be limited. I assume through regulation, which must consider the geopolitical effects of "from where" we get that oil.

4030 2018-10-26 22:16:37 He only mentioned oil and military but that’s not the whole story at all. One vital element is national security and anti terrorism fight which are in cooperation with saudi arabia.
4031 2018-10-26 22:16:34 You just go as whatever you want but you secretly get paid by oil companies and then you vote republican every. Damn. Time.

4052 2018-10-26 22:13:31 A carbon price should accelerate coal-to-gas switch. Remember that Exxon has huge play in gas after spending $30 billion to buy XTO. And Exxon is not a coal producer. A carbon price would help them take market share in power production while affecting oil very little.

4102 2018-10-26 22:06:53 Then we need to fight back with exposing the real subsidy: oil. 

Which is the exact reason why they’re kicking and screaming: keep the status quo
4103 2018-10-26 22:06:47 @realDonaldTrump me president I have inside knowledge from some good connections that the USA can start exporting oil so please look into that please
4104 2018-10-26 22:06:44 Please. The snake oil salesman has spoken...
4105 2018-10-26 22:06:34 Prolly the same one leakin all that oil
4106 2018-10-26 22:06:28 SS won't disappear. The idea is to purchase ins before you have an illness or condition. You do know that right? Besides Trump wants preexisting conditions covered. Oil Field pollution... who wants that? We here in CA are held at gun point by the oil companies. They're criminals.

4113 2018-10-26 22:05:24 Thank God for @realDonaldTrump He's the first President to fight back against countries that claim to be our allies, yet take the US to the cleaners in trade. Finally, Angela Merkel realized that buying oil and gas from the US is best not only for security reasons, but also $$.
4114 2018-10-26 22:05:16 SO IRONIC that we are spending billions to protect the part of the planet from rising oceans that is SO RESPONSIBLE for the rising oceans. Can't have those oil refineries under water now can we?

Let me see if he will pull out the wrestling tights, get @Brandon_Rewucki to lube him up w/ his Hawaiian skin oil & get this done for a certain total amount donated! Both said they wanted to contribute in other ways...

4123 2018-10-26 22:04:10 All came in from the east but most  between Inchkeith and Edinburgh but some in off the tip of Fife. Many still at sea level and rising opp Hounds Point others continuing low north of the oil terminal
4124 2018-10-26 22:04:05 I don’t think you understand the seriousness of it all. People will be able to sit in traffic much earlier when they get of the train that Scottish oil has paid for again. Think M25.

4137 2018-10-26 22:02:01 Exactly, even new cars that run full synthetic you can go 10k every oil change
4138 2018-10-26 22:01:55 Cogan:”Trump adm intends to rely on Saudi Arabia to increase its oil  production to prevent major price rises when harsh new US sanctions go  into effect against Iran on November 5, following Washington’s  unilateral renunciation of the 2015 “Joint Comprehensive Plan of  Action””

4140 2018-10-26 22:01:50 My car has been in service since 8am n still not ready... just went for a oil change n they tell me it has 2 recalls
4141 2018-10-26 22:01:43 Why don’t you report on the crown and ownership of the gas oil gold & silver in the U.K. ?
4142 2018-10-26 22:01:33 98% of climate scientists agree that climate change is occurring, and due to human impact. the 2% are people who have been paid off my fossil fuel and oil companies to keep their mouths shut
4143 2018-10-26 22:01:11 Please don't deceive the children..  
Admit that our countries oil is controlled by private industry (Suncor) and shareholders, and that you cannot do anything!
4144 2018-10-26 22:00:57 i think i used baby oil
4145 2018-10-26 22:00:55 I only use beard oil for the beard
4146 2018-10-26 22:00:46 Try the oil cleanser by Dermalogica. It’s really good. =)
4147 2018-10-26 22:00:41 This team will never win with Klentak and Captain Coconut Oil. Klentak does his job as well as a typical fantasy baseball participant. There are 29 managers better than Kapler in MLB.
4148 2018-10-26 22:00:40 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.
4149 2018-10-26 22:00:40 Nothing will change, people will still die from cancer whilst archaic chemo and radiotherapy are being used. Thanx Pharmaceutical bastards. Just use cannabis oil ffs. #StandUpToCancer
4150 2018-10-26 22:00:33 not taxing CO2 emissions coming from oil and ice autos amounts to around a $200 Trillion climate damage credit. and you WHINE about a 7500$ EV tax credit? wake up...for your children...
4151 2018-10-26 22:00:33 I call Tinman! Gonna have an oil can and everything.

4157 2018-10-26 22:00:01 Great performance at @TheRSC tonight #RSCTroilus was everything I'd hoped for. Glam, sexy, sad,  violent.... Made spectacularly better by the folks behind sharing a bin liner of very loud jellybabies and dousing themselves liberally with Olbas Oil. #mannersmaketh
4158 2018-10-26 21:59:44 Lmao naw man I get my oil changed I know it ain’t that
4159 2018-10-26 21:59:44 This clearly shows the NDPs support for the pipeline and getting our oil to tidewater, perhaps your party could have Had a similar agenda instead of talking about outing LGBTQ+ children.
4160 2018-10-26 21:59:26 @realDonaldTrump Trump and Iran must agree on some base facts before Nov5th so that Saudi Arabia and Russia are checked for loot on oil. So Trump must allow some soft corner to India for oil ,its reliable ally and make Saudi and Iran fight each other by purchasing arms from USA.
4161 2018-10-26 21:59:05 Lol
4162 2018-10-26 21:58:57 just last year he signed an order opening up every mile of US coastline to be made available to big oil for off shore drilling, which poses an enormous risk to sea life and the coastline. His caring goes as far as the extent to which he can brag about something.
4163 2018-10-26 21:58:53 Preheat oven to 400* F. Remove seeds and brush olive oil on all sides and inside. Bake for 40-50 minutes or until pumpkin is fully cooked.

4166 2018-10-26 21:58:39 Gospel is my first love of music. The old gospel, not new gospel. New gospel music has no oil.

4169 2018-10-26 21:58:14 Drinking water to sober up and it was harder to brush it but once I finished I put some oil in it and it seems okay now
4170 2018-10-26 21:58:07 Do they change oil?
4171 2018-10-26 21:57:58 Aye Lisa my niggah for grabbing babies oil 
4172 2018-10-26 21:57:57 Not in water!
Good Lord above!
Shred it. Cook it down in olive oil and salt and chilli. With garlic or red onion. 
Yum diddly yum.
4173 2018-10-26 21:57:45 That oil change got my car running like it's driving like it's gliding
4174 2018-10-26 21:57:28 I’ve been medical for years, medreleaf cbd oil is my fav, broken coast is terrific, tried $weed and a few others. I recommend growing your own. Even if it’s just one outdoor. 
4175 2018-10-26 21:57:25 Grape seed oil is one of the best oils to apply on your face / body . It doesn’t clog your pores and it’s so hydrating . Evens skin tone .
4176 2018-10-26 21:57:19 Bitch you probably poured the wiper fluid in the oil tank didn’t you bitch lol
4177 2018-10-26 21:57:18 This man has been partisan and does not qualify to be an election observer, his report will never be sincere, he should be dropped by inec, he's not just
4178 2018-10-26 21:57:12 You’re no oil painting yourself, if your picture is anything to go be. Still, please feel free to trivialise a domestic terrorist.

4181 2018-10-26 21:57:05 Kitchen Pro Tip: If you stir coconut oil into your kale, it make it easier to scoop into the trash.
4182 2018-10-26 21:57:05 Its demeaning for me to leave patients needing care to queue for 750ml of cooking oil...
Let them hustle. At least their families can 'burn' $10 buy beef and import cooking oil..
4183 2018-10-26 21:56:56 Sorry but you need to go to spec savers. Senna is no oil painting but speedtail is pig ugly. The F1 was stunning and a world beater. ST is 7mph faster and much quicker accelerating but desirability is no where compared to F1. Get Peter Stevens back ASAP!!

4186 2018-10-26 21:56:47 I think the reason why the land they call their home land is so hotly contested it's because it's full of oil isn't it ???

4188 2018-10-26 21:56:11 I hope they don't have palm oil.  If they don't, I may possibly partake.
4189 2018-10-26 21:56:06 tendria que volver a la escritura, so mi imaginación se quedo sin gas oil
4190 2018-10-26 21:55:18 Why do oil changes take sooooo LONG
4191 2018-10-26 21:54:59 Ooh, I’ll have to try them with cajun seasoning next time. Yum! Today I’m having one with olive oil and salt. Definitely time to branch out, though.
4192 2018-10-26 21:54:55 TV guide shows the ARCA race from Lucas Oil Raceway will air next Saturday night November 3rd on MavTV
4193 2018-10-26 21:54:47 Made me an offer via email then after driving 100 miles they realized they made a mistake. They counteroffered twice but when something is committed. It needs to be upheld. 

They did offer to buy my gas home and some free oil changes.
4194 2018-10-26 21:54:31 Oooh col. Can she turn into a raptor? Cus then she'd instinctively know how to oil

4200 2018-10-26 21:53:41 @ishakaa lol you appear not to trust that man at all.
4201 2018-10-26 21:53:28 So are you waiting for them to admit they want total control? It'd be kind of late by then. 
Maxine Waters wants to nationalize oil companies. 
How do you boil a frog? Put it in the pot and slowly slowly turn up the heat..a little at a time. 
Think about it. 
Have a great day!
4202 2018-10-26 21:53:02 Our favourite way to make them is to slice them up, toss them in olive oil, sprinkle with cajun seasoning and bake for about half an hour. DELICIOUS!!
4203 2018-10-26 21:52:56 Murder for oil.....sounds familiar
4204 2018-10-26 21:52:43 It’s sucks that many great fans have to move to the mainland. I’m sure there’s tons up there. Trav, you gotta get some rich oil guy to let us “borrow” money haha
4205 2018-10-26 21:52:23 Mark..... I am not only NOT in cahoots with big oil, but I am very careful about keeping a low carbon footprint.  I bike to work rain or shine!  Avoid unnecessary travel.   I have NOTHING TO DO WITH BIG OIL.  No grants, no relationship.
4206 2018-10-26 21:51:55 I love oil diffusers! Be careful if you have animals! Some oils can be toxic for them even through diffusers!
4207 2018-10-26 21:51:37 About 2 weeks ago I bought a 1000mg bottle of CBD oil. It is supposed to help with anxiety. After a a few days I just drank the bottle. The next day I bought 5 bottles and now I just do shots every time I hear the fool speak.
4208 2018-10-26 21:51:11 There are no new jobs. Companies are outsourcing. Those beautiful new steel mills are non existent. Coal is not making a comeback nor should it. Oil will be a thing of the past. We should be giving subsidies to green, renewable, clean, industries. That's our future.
4209 2018-10-26 21:51:10 I hope that there will be good news about China's, India's, and Europe's oil sanctions, and we are all waiting for the oil cut off of these countries, when I make sure that there are credible news. I said the truth about being exempted, and its heavy consequences
4210 2018-10-26 21:51:00 My tweet has nothing to do with kd, am not even there
4211 2018-10-26 21:51:00 Debbie Stabehow would have been able to do more for constituents at the great State of Michigan if the stiffnecked GOP did not Block her every move. If Michigan gets another Trump AssKisser they will be sorry. GOP wants to drill, drill, drill for Oil on their beautiful Lands.
4212 2018-10-26 21:50:46 It’s a pity I agree. They don’t need to use palm oil - but then Nestle doesn’t exactly have a great track record on ethics
4213 2018-10-26 21:50:38 Stop buying oil from them.
4214 2018-10-26 21:50:20 Amin

4221 2018-10-26 21:49:11 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
4222 2018-10-26 21:48:59 You're right, who cares about a $42B market... in other news, wheat futures are down, DJIA dumped another 600 - US equity markets tumbles, NASDAQ sank 329, oil is up, gold is weak.  NCI had worst one-day performance since 2011 and socialist farmers on gov handouts.

4229 2018-10-26 21:47:47 ...and too much baby oil.
4230 2018-10-26 21:47:40 Yes. Stop right now ... and continue to make us dependent on Russia for gas and the Saudis for oil. Even though there’s not a shred of real evidence that fracking is dangerous.
4231 2018-10-26 21:47:37 Hola back at ya :) Know where I can get chilli infused EVOO, if such a product exists, or how to make my own? Love your story and ethos, and Andalucia - been twice! First order is in the bag,
4232 2018-10-26 21:47:04 Saudi Arabia must be overthrown and it’s oil seized for the benefit European nations willing to reject the EU and ally with the Trump administration to create a Christian new world order.
4233 2018-10-26 21:47:02 Это происходит так часто, что начинает пугать
4234 2018-10-26 21:46:58 It’s a tough one, because it doesn’t fit any real definition. It’s a mixed economic system, but it’s oil sector is owned by the state, which pushes me to say state capitalism, but it also has a strong private market too, leading me to social market capitalism.
4235 2018-10-26 21:46:53 Fried egg in leftover bacon oil >>>
4236 2018-10-26 21:46:38 Use baby oil, brush it downwards.
4237 2018-10-26 21:46:38 An under appreciated aspect of I-1631 is that by shifting folks from oil -> electricity, we stop sending money to other States, and instead spend it here building green infrastructure (solar panels, hydro, transmission lines, etc). It's almost certainly a net win for WA jobs.
4238 2018-10-26 21:46:19 Ok, I have limited time to come up with a Halloween costume for a party and so far my ideas for costumes using things I already have are:
1. Oil slick
2. Trash Panda (not a raccoon & def not a *sexy* raccoon)
3. Lady from Hoarders
4. failed dessert from Great British Baking Show
4239 2018-10-26 21:46:09 Definitely not an original oil painting
4240 2018-10-26 21:46:05 You can get oil for it too
4241 2018-10-26 21:46:00 Tested and trusted. Just add a dash of aloe vera juice, 5 spoons of honey, a cup of olive oil,  and fast for five days.  You'll be okay. 
4242 2018-10-26 21:45:48 OILは流石に…_(:3 」∠)_
4243 2018-10-26 21:45:37 PLEASE STOP USING PALM.OIL IN YOUR PRODUCTS!
4244 2018-10-26 21:45:33 A coworker literally caught me putting it in my mouth (I have oil drops) but she didn’t say shit. Lol

4246 2018-10-26 21:45:27 I'll never be able to use coconut oil in the kitchen again without remembering this tweet.
4247 2018-10-26 21:45:16 LOL the payors say no to fish oil and tell all high CV risk patients to walk it off? not for anything if the XBI/IBB continues to fail this will get whacked.  Please it's a niche play it's not the next AMGN.  
4248 2018-10-26 21:44:43 Let’s face it here, the oil have played really good hockey so far this season aside from the opener against jersey and the first period in Boston. They are an improved, faster, hungrier team than last years version

See bah, turn the dodo again, the oil never hot .
4256 2018-10-26 21:43:16 If there's a next time, try using some sort of oil (cooking oil, WD40) to break up the sticky stuff. Ask at your local hardware store.
4257 2018-10-26 21:43:13 Is there any problem that coconut oil couldn’t fix?

4265 2018-10-26 21:42:37 I’m having a super productive day, my mood has been in the pits. I just lit my burner with the #spicyfairy oil from @clairemarcuslux. I’m not all the way out of it but I feel way lighter maybe it’s the orange or cause I’m a sucker for cinnamon but I’m in haven right now #cmislit
4266 2018-10-26 21:42:33 Do jail commissaries stock coconut oil? TT may have to substitute the guts of an Almond Joy or Mounds bar instead during her confinement 
4267 2018-10-26 21:42:06 Fracking is a dirty business with greedy oil companies hoping to make a quick buck and governments thinking of tax return benefits. Look at water contamination stories from America - everyone knows it’s unethical to frack. Earthquakes tell you to stop.

4301 2018-10-26 21:36:34 I will cook whole (fairly) complex meals for a single, super-specific flavour. Tonight it’s pearl onions softened by heat, white wine and good olive oil.
4302 2018-10-26 21:36:14 I listened to a Texas oil worker state very clearly he doesn’t care if Trump divides us. Dude is making a killing fracking so he doesn’t care. This was a radio interview on public radio. I am getting to where I just want to scream.

4312 2018-10-26 21:33:48 If I thought, even for one deluded second, that you actually want to build a pipeline I would stagger and fall. 
Your entire life you have fought the oil industry, tried to shut down Fort Mcmurray and killed the Northern Gateway and Energy East. Why would I believe you now?
4313 2018-10-26 21:33:39 Ok. Did you hear hell hounds around for some reason? Just curious bout the glasses. Usually only time you put those on is when you douse them with holy oil and want to look for them.. be safe and I know Cas will be there to keep you safe too.  Ash sends a hug too

4320 2018-10-26 21:33:02 Some advice on oily fish...

Many oily fish such as Striped Bass have a "vein" of oil that runs along the side of the fish. If you carefully cut it out, the fish will not be as oily.

4323 2018-10-26 21:32:43 @johniadarola Can i ask why you haven't said anything about Trump allowing drilling for oil in the artic? I know America is a hot mess right now but i would have thought that would have gotten you're attention.

4332 2018-10-26 21:30:59 Tell me oilfields don't use something called a borehole to get oil out of the ground? Who needs to cause earthquakes?
4333 2018-10-26 21:30:57 Quick and easy way is oil, Johnny’s seasoning and grill until you’ve hit 190 internal temp. BBQ sauce as optional.
4334 2018-10-26 21:30:53 The oil is the medium that God works through.
4335 2018-10-26 21:30:50 I have. I’m off grid with solar, geothermal and wind power. As a aside, our (shocker) the net metering application process is ridiculous. Again because the government hates people going renewal energy and not sucking on the coal/oil teat
4336 2018-10-26 21:30:36 So I have business cards cuz I’m an adult now right? Except I always see them when I’m looking to write stuff down, picked one up with info for an oil change on it

4367 2018-10-26 21:26:39 Oil breakdown is not the only issue. Oil filters can only handle so much grime, and if you drive dusty roads a lot you may need to change it more often. Regardless, using a standard filter with synthetic oil will still only last you about 3k miles.

And we only put potatoes, eggs, oil and onion (optional, but most of  chefs put it).

4381 2018-10-26 21:25:26 Bannon's goal is to target Blacks and Latinos which Mr. President is following through. Higher tariffs, Higher oil, higher costs, lower profits, stock markets correction or starting of big meltdown. Big losses on 401k especially China ADRs. Talk to China please!
4382 2018-10-26 21:25:20 Sadly, this comes as no surprise.  The Lib lovesick media backed a snake oil salesman & his latest stooge instead of seeking the truth.

4388 2018-10-26 21:24:19 Millions of children go to school near oil and gas operations. Children are especially vulnerable to potential #health effects, including cancer, respiratory illness, fetal defects, blood disorders, and neurological problems. @EPAAWheeler: act to protect our kids! #cutmethane

4394 2018-10-26 21:23:16 THEY HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE HISTORY OF THIS ENVIRO WACKO GROUPS. THEY EFFECTIVELY DESTROYED THE FOREST INDUSTRY IN BC, AND THEY HAVE STOPPED NEW MINING PROJECTS DEAD IN THEIR TRACKS AND THEIR NEXT FOCUS IS THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. THE GUYS HAD BETTER GET THEIR BIG BOY PANTS ON !
4395 2018-10-26 21:23:12 the other day my uncle was going to USA he told me they had to stop in Nasarawa to buy engine oil for the plane

You’re welcome 
4402 2018-10-26 21:21:47 I would have been studying chemical engineering, because I wanted to work in oil and gas after school ...or just join a dance group

4412 2018-10-26 21:20:45 I'd need to see the difference between a control oil and CBD oil before deciding that the CBD was responsible for the improvement.
4413 2018-10-26 21:20:38 Since 9/11, I have advocated inviting Turkey to resume its occupation of the Arabian Peninsula, indeed, entire Middle East, and to do what it wishes with the Saudis/UAE, et al., as well as their oil. Only condition: leave our only friends, Armenians Kurds, Yazidis, alone.
4414 2018-10-26 21:20:22 Black castor oil or coconut oil . Could mix them

4417 2018-10-26 21:20:13 And 5) people have irrational fear that somehow oil will disappear if we stop sucking up to the Saudis.

Justin's "Uncle" Maurice Strong, former head of Petro Canada

Investigations into the UN’s Oil-for-Food-Program found that Strong had endorsed a cheque for $988,885 made out to M. Strong — issued by a Jordanian bank. He fled to China.

4421 2018-10-26 21:19:00 I'm one of the lucky ones.  My dads, yes plural (birth dad and stepdad, both deceased now) taught me everything they knew. Seek out a good guy to learn from, uncles,grandads,neighbors.  It's  a blessing to be able to handle small repairs, change your own oil, build and fix.

4424 2018-10-26 21:18:55 Robert Mercer and Renaissance Technology and all the hedge funds and mutual funds on Wall Street are invested in the future of oil. Tesla and Elon are a threat to trillions of dollars. They will do anything to destroy Tesla. They want to preserve dirty energy.

4429 2018-10-26 21:18:39 The younger Saudis want to accept liberal westernization and markets are opening up. However, they need to have liberalism shoved down their throats to see if they'll cooperate when it's not about oil. A married gay tag team having a public makeout session? #WWECrownJewel #WWE
4430 2018-10-26 21:18:21 ... does it matter when the executive Oil chief doubles down on TransMountain pipelines and says “no country would find 173bn barrels of oil in the ground and just leave it there”?
4431 2018-10-26 21:18:09 Good for you. Now start walking to work. Get rid of about 90% of your stuff, because most everything has oil based products. Then you’ll bring the oil and gas industry to its knees.
4432 2018-10-26 21:18:03 cbd heavy strains do help with anxiety for some people , not everyone tho. as most things its individual . finding a good balanced strain / oil is nessecary for each person and the usecase they intend to use it for . But usualy cbd heavy with a low thc-a content works for anxiety

"Model Years 2021-2026 would increase domestic oil consumption by 500,000 barrels of oil per day, as well as increase consumer spending by $20 billion a year..."
Got that, increase consumption by 500K bls/day. Not static but increase.

4457 2018-10-26 21:14:28 Trump is a savage with no moral code what-so-ever. His first foreign policy speech he advocated for pillage and plunder (take the oil and give it to the veterans). Basically the same policy that ushered in the dark ages in Europe. Elect a savage to lead the country and he does.

4471 2018-10-26 21:11:35 Yeah, I believe the whole weapons of mass destruction was a false premise for the war in Iraq. I think some people wanted the oil but others wanted a 21st century Marshall plan for them Middle East, to honestly spread democracy but the general public weren’t up for it.

4477 2018-10-26 21:10:16 Thank you! I didn’t either, but it was “natural oil” based so I should have been suspicious. It makes sense that  if you can die from eating it, if it gets on your skin you’ll have issues. :/ Hindsight is 20/20 as always.
4478 2018-10-26 21:10:13 I feel your pain - had 2 wisdom teeth out last month. Before having the tooth out I found clove oil or garlic helped. Hope you feel better soon xx

4491 2018-10-26 21:08:54 to stop me being more neurotic point to UKGov plan to stop an Aberdeen ghost town once oil runs out (imminent every time independence gets popular).
Apparently voting no helped us dodge a bullet, 'm looking at how ukgov is planning to improve my kids future - any pointers?
4492 2018-10-26 21:08:51 I love this place that change my oil , they check all my fluids and tires every time.
4493 2018-10-26 21:08:40 Instrumenting the oil/vinegar shaker would be tricky. 

But you can probably find someone who has a fluidized bed test bed at some mechanical or chemical engineering department somewhere in CA. It might take phoning around.   They might be up for having students see pressure data
4494 2018-10-26 21:08:13 I ordered castor oil yesterday actuqlly :)

4512 2018-10-26 21:05:32 It's kind of funny that opponents to #Prop109 think that funding our roads & bridges w/ less than 1% of current budget is either a "bogus talking point" or "snake oil." I call it a core function of government. #FixOurDamnRoads
4513 2018-10-26 21:05:32 Among other remedies, hay salt etc spray liquid parafin/ veg oil along fence line on crop with knapsack as a suggestion. Good luck

4531 2018-10-26 21:02:08 Logan doesn’t know jack about how the oil industry works.
4532 2018-10-26 21:02:03 other good brands; cantu and shea moisture r kinda pricey. people say theyre affordable but we both know thats a relative word. the starter kit i used was shea butter, jamaican black castor oil, coconut oil, olive oil organics shampoo/deep conditioner n water
4533 2018-10-26 21:02:03 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
4534 2018-10-26 21:02:00 Believer I’ve see cannabis oil work #StandUpToCancer
4535 2018-10-26 21:01:56 It would help explain why CBD oil caused me to crash.
4536 2018-10-26 21:01:53 So a car with some decent ground clearance. An SUV or CUV.. barely needs to get lifted to reach under and drain the oil myself..

4540 2018-10-26 21:01:31 Beautiful day. At church parade, we were favoured with a highly oratorical sermon by Smith, the young YMCA Secretary. He must have burned gallons of midnight oil over it. A congregation of professors might have got the gist of it.#WW100

4554 2018-10-26 20:59:40 It’s all gone. There is no more oil or gas in Scotland. Oh and it’s worthless and very different and difficult and it’s all doom and the gloom and everything bad.

4556 2018-10-26 20:59:10 Hey, Dr Greger, what’s your take on men supplementing with Flaxseed oil? @DrWeil advises against it. @Nutrition_Facts
4557 2018-10-26 20:59:06 Changing oil is actually super easy and you can save a TON of money doing it by yourself! Plus that way you know it’s done CORRECTLY. I found out when I did my own oil change that the place hadn’t been replacing my oil filter 
4558 2018-10-26 20:58:56 I’m beginning to see why it says to only use the wild hair growth oil 3 times out the week ... my egdes growing into my eyebrows 
4559 2018-10-26 20:58:54 Tim nailed it you have to do a diary and figure out what works. I cape but when my anxiety is up I'm 100% cbd only and usually as oil or a candy. I can't go full Sativa really. It has to be hybrid and some strains are just a hard no Since I've stopped combusting tho joints= 
4560 2018-10-26 20:58:51 Kashoggi was used as bait to catch the big fish and that fish has badly trapped. The days Of MBS are numbered. All the oil rich Muslim countries were destroyed on the basis of fundamentalism and MBS agreed to convert KSA liberal which was not according to plan. So well played CIA
4561 2018-10-26 20:58:50 In the industry Of lying? Or oil?
4562 2018-10-26 20:58:47 We also need to get rid of Philip Green. Send him to a disused oil rig or something.
4563 2018-10-26 20:58:46 a bird covered in oil smoking lucky strikes
4564 2018-10-26 20:58:42 I know but it’s one thing to think it one way or the other.  It’s another to put these words down on a article that can be read by anyone.  It means likely that sentiment is not just his own...very bad for investment prospects in oil and gas infrastructure in Canada...
4565 2018-10-26 20:58:41 Yes, oil fired CH. I think there's a pyromaniac in me as like a moth I love the flames. We have 4 1/2 acres of wood, so tonight I'm burning chestnut logs from a branch that was struck by lightning last year.
4566 2018-10-26 20:58:32 Not to to with oil reserves then?or deep drilling..
4567 2018-10-26 20:58:08 But as I said before, it’s like trying to turn an oil tanker around after the shambles since the summer. And I can see it nudging slightly. Let’s give them all a bit longer than a week before condemning them all already shall we? #avfc
4568 2018-10-26 20:57:54 Obama made the claim that we wouldn’t see growth over 2% and would need to get used to that. He ensured regulations would stifle growth and vowed to put inditries out of business like manufacturing and coal. And I’ll add oil and gas.
4569 2018-10-26 20:57:52 I'm really into the idea of changing my own oil, though. Less strangers laying their hands unnecessarily on a car. 
4570 2018-10-26 20:57:50 Nope without the crew from the Philippines/Ghana/Sri Lanka the fishing industry would not exist,when the EU chopped up half the UK fleet in the late 90's most of our own crew left to work at the oil,everything is legal&foreign crew are only ones to get guaranteed wages
4571 2018-10-26 20:57:43 Use coconut oil at night time
4572 2018-10-26 20:57:42 I wonder how much research is   going into using cannabis oil for cancer pharmaceutical company’s won’t earn as much money #StandUpToCancer
4573 2018-10-26 20:57:31 cada día me hago mas señora. si no es el cambio de clima es la politica, si no es saber si tu crush tiene hijos es hacer lonche para mi amiga y yo para el camino, si no es querer dormir 46 horas seguidas y amanecer muerta es buscar productos sin palm oil. tengo 19.
4574 2018-10-26 20:57:15 How unfortunate can you be to steal a person’s means of livelihood.May God replace it for him with an even bigger blessing
4575 2018-10-26 20:57:10 I don't like to use words like hope Deven - although I know what you mean. This is a certainty. Large pieces of production are now idled...like taking Saudi Arabia production out of the oil equation. Demand is coming online quickly. There is already a shortfall and it will worsen
4576 2018-10-26 20:57:10 -Make a lip scrub (mix a teaspoon of honey with two teaspoons of sugar)
-Apply an oil or butter based lip balm to your lips
-Drink lots of water
-Brush with a soft toothbrush
-Use almond oil
-Try not to lick your lips! (I know it must be a habit)
4577 2018-10-26 20:57:09 That's cool. Do you paint a lot? In hs my hands were too shakey to do much, so I switched to oil pastels since they had more direct contact with the canvas.
4578 2018-10-26 20:57:07 Casting starts at 5.
Me, at the beginning of the run: -leaves house at 2, gets to casting by 4-

Me, today, a week left of the run: -gets an oil change at 2, gets Starbucks at 4:56- “this is good.”
4579 2018-10-26 20:57:03 Travesty. Not helping poor. Just like their University free fees, their Taranaki Oil and Gas. So many decisions disproportionately affect the poor
4580 2018-10-26 20:56:58 Venezuela is in a similar situation as the US continues to squeeze them. While not a nuclear power they sit atop the largest oil field in the world and the US wants to give it back to big oil.
4581 2018-10-26 20:56:56 Me  I always put traditional bread in the fridge esp in winter.. I put it there and when I"m hungry I just bring some olive oil and heat the bread and here u got a hot healthy meal *-*
4582 2018-10-26 20:56:42 Well definitely choose a cleansing oil or balm over Micellar water anyday yess. Especially if I’m using baby wipes n not makeup wipes.
4583 2018-10-26 20:56:28 Just waiting for an oil spill! There has been one in the Gulf of Mexico since 2004. Why isn't he dealing w/it?

4591 2018-10-26 20:55:10 My dad is the absolute best he got me 4 new tires, an alignment, and oil change 
4592 2018-10-26 20:55:02 Of course we can reconsider that if Cam ever gets hurt and Oil need to rely on Montoya or Skinner to carry rest of way to playoffs.  Or goes cold.
4593 2018-10-26 20:55:00 Ha! No heel clicking needed. Renewables are already here, but the dirty oil/gas lobby is standing in their way. In Xcel’s most recent bids for new power plants, renewables were far cheaper than any other power source, including ntrl gas!
4594 2018-10-26 20:54:56 New Orleans, at a conference, dead tired after the week and presenting that afternoon...staying in my room and ordering a plate of roasted oysters smothered in parmesan and olive oil, and a peanut/chocolate shake.
4595 2018-10-26 20:54:50 Fenty is super dry and matte so if you don’t have oily skin make sure to mix it with a good facial oil or you’ll be dry and stiff all day lol (learned the hard way) if you get oily throughout the day you good lol

4613 2018-10-26 20:51:57 Wow... what is systemically racist on using natural gas, oil and coal?  What is systemically racist about limiting unemployment to 13 weeks rather than 99, or making people provide documentation of employment interviews to receive assistance and unemployment.
4614 2018-10-26 20:51:40 Y’all got me for the $20 oil change?

4624 2018-10-26 20:50:07 You don't even know how to lie. This project was 80% completed before the last administration left. Also, the completion has nothing to do with oil prices. It was financed with a Chinese loan which has nothing to do with oil prices!

4811 2018-10-26 20:20:22 Wow this @RLGRIME Halloween 7 mix is giving me lifee  When I got to minute 6 and heard @awonderland I lost my shit and I’m sitting in a tiny waiting room w 4 other people waiting for my car’s oil change to be done 
4812 2018-10-26 20:20:22 I just wished the advertised it better. Booked better storylines for it instead of hyping up Oil Mania.
4813 2018-10-26 20:20:18 Country was becoming more divided during Obama. He lied about so much & called us ignorant & uneducated. Repubs weren’t much better. We voted for them, then they’d let us down. US has better trade deals, better economy, no longer dependent on foreign oil. Exposing the corruption.

4818 2018-10-26 20:20:03 Lol I remember that to. And the shock of olive oil being used in food. And not bought from a chemist for your ears .

4880 2018-10-26 20:12:22 Ok.. If you look at our economy, energy products make up just over 10%, most of that being uranium. Of that 10%, dirty Alberta crude oil makes up about 31%. Do the math - dirty Alberta oil contributes a whopping 3% to Canada's economy.
4881 2018-10-26 20:12:16 Yeah I had "oil pressure" warning I took that as oil and chucked a load in. Still the light came on and on my way home one night had to come off the a12! 1/2

4901 2018-10-26 20:10:15 Problem is, there are people saying that a $40/ton carbon tax falls into that "token" category, using the oil & gas support for it as evidence.  That's silly.
4902 2018-10-26 20:10:12 Also, the statement about Telsa doing more than any other company to break oil dependence is simply not accurate. Not even a little bit.

4951 2018-10-26 20:04:18 Pffft "axe" is old school. Chainsaw oil is the new sex panther.

Me last night: (takes a bunch of The Oil & spends an hour and a half trying to make a midi file of Limp Bizkit's Rollin' into a playable file for MapleStory 2)
4955 2018-10-26 20:03:55 He's not a messiah, he's just an incredibly hard-working scientist/engineer.  But Tesla has done more to break the world free from oil than any other company. 

But let's all hate him because he's rich? He's eccentric?
4956 2018-10-26 20:03:48 So what happened to the United States being the defenders of human rights and the innocent. Oh wait I understand now they dont have oil reserves or any other natural resources that needs US military protection.
4957 2018-10-26 20:03:30 Ppl keep telling me how they use my massage oil for lube. Shawty said its edible too

4960 2018-10-26 20:03:04 “created by an electronic smoking device” NOT a vaporizer; SMOKING device. A vaporizer isn’t a smoking device at all, so by this definition, whatever comes out if it isn’t covered by the bylaw. Vapour is not smoke. If it was those desk essential oil vaporizers would be illegal.

4964 2018-10-26 20:02:29 DID YOU KNOW?
The oil industry provides about 90% of Nigeria’s export revenue and has made Nigeria the 
largest oil producing and largest oil exporting country in Africa

4965 2018-10-26 20:02:13 I’m not used to a car issue being a non crisis. Low oil light? OH NO I SEVERED A HOSE I PUNCTURED SOMETHING AH CRAP and then no, I just burned a lot of oil this fall. 

Dude even spotted me the oil and changed my key battery. 

We’re good.
4966 2018-10-26 20:02:09 My skin routine is real simple though. Just a mild facial cleanser, rose and cucumber water, and coconut oil.

4973 2018-10-26 20:01:33 How much of the Shae butter and coconut oil are you using? Are you mixing them togethe? Since the Shae butter is so thick, I balance it out with the coconut oil.

4977 2018-10-26 20:01:20 @FLGovScott what are you doing about the oil spill in the Gulf?  It may prove to be the biggest disaster in American history????
4978 2018-10-26 20:01:13 Tesla has done more than any other company to provide a way to get us off oil...and you are gonna attack them because you have some weird grudge against Elon?

This is how liberals destroy themselves.
4979 2018-10-26 20:00:58 I was trying to make beans (for next week) and then my gas finished. Who's the minister of petroleum, oil and gas? He has to go. 

I'm so angry rn.
4980 2018-10-26 20:00:43 Oh bio oil never thought of that I’ve got some!! I need them off literally got one left xx
4981 2018-10-26 20:00:34 ...Everything we've become, including climate convulsion, has come from under foot of Saud.  The sulfur of putrefaction that comes from oil that offended the nose also comes with the jinns' sporadic fumerole fires & smoke, hot foot, house fires & local diabolic reputation.
4982 2018-10-26 20:00:32 #StrugglesOnGilligansIsland
Fresh water. Firewood. Matches. Torch oil. Make-up. Just sayin'.
4983 2018-10-26 20:00:25 I thought what I was huffing was china oil, but it's actually Japanese oil. 

Well. Whatever gets me breathin'.
4984 2018-10-26 20:00:13 All the comparative oil prices also deal with transport. That point is moot
4985 2018-10-26 20:00:13 Thanks a lot, though they sell us for billions of oil Dollars. #SaudiArabia is #Barbarism at its worst.
4986 2018-10-26 20:00:02 @AndrewGillum Whar RU doing about the oil spill in the Gulf.  May be the biggest disaster in history!!!
4987 2018-10-26 19:59:58 Blasphemy belongs in the dark ages just like Islam. Its values are irrelevant to any society that wants to progress in the 21C whatever the Saudis think. Their culture is only relevant whilst they have oil, without oil they will have no money and thus will be irrelevant.
4988 2018-10-26 19:59:57 Thank you Dan for the insight. We definitely need to focus on civics for all Americans.we also need to put our taxpayer money where it belongs public education and health ( mental too! ) not Raytheon arms contracts and the oil industry. MLK all the way!
4989 2018-10-26 19:59:39 Big oil now owns the FBI? Wow! The fascist takeover Murdoch has always dreamed of, if true!
4990 2018-10-26 19:59:37 Im watching.. I am intrigued.
4991 2018-10-26 19:59:30 finally after 10,000 miles...... i’m getting an oil change 
4992 2018-10-26 19:59:23 I think that city people tend to spend more time on computers, on their  smart phones etc and are paying closer attention to what's going. People in rural areas tend to work jobs like farming, oil fields etc and don't spend  a lot of time  on current events.
4993 2018-10-26 19:59:20 A recent article by a US investment analyst specializing in oil & gas markets.  The speculation by at least some on the ‘money’ side is that neither Transmountain or Keystone XL will ever reach the finish line.  If true, epic failure from AB, BC, & CDN govt’s.  #abpoli #cdnpoli
4994 2018-10-26 19:58:58 @TomSteyer What are we doing about the oil spill in the Gulf which is expected to be the largest we have seen.
4995 2018-10-26 19:58:40 So to be fair (which you never are) why not apply the tax to all offshore oil entering Canada? Oh right, you love dirty stinking oil from dictators and asshole like the 
KSA but hate Alberta and Saskatchewan oil.
4996 2018-10-26 19:58:38 @SEALTeamCBS @David_Boreanaz @SEALteamFans 2nd series of Seal Team now showing in UK. Superb 1st episode on the oil rig.
4997 2018-10-26 19:58:10 I will never forget the day I came home from school and my parents found fish oil and glucosamine pills and they thought it was steroids smh
4998 2018-10-26 19:58:05 Ewe uyazibona  but the Moroccan oil that they used, did the things.
4999 2018-10-26 19:57:52 #COT = spec book for #oil as of 10/25/18, net long 455,278; change of 37,951 or 7.69% down from prev. 493,229; 61.60% of 739,097 max on 2/6/18
5000 2018-10-26 19:57:51 I can’t go to no skinny state trying to get fast food. They use fat free oil n shit
5001 2018-10-26 19:57:38 That list is so vague as to be meaningless anyway. "The future of our environment?" Is that statement of opposition to oil pipelines and fracking? Or just a virtue signal, "I care about the environment."
5002 2018-10-26 19:57:36 Then i guess oil & strategic placement of our forces would be our dipping sauce. & we're gonna get that dippin sauce morty 'merica! Its all been about that sweet sweet petroleum dipping sauce. I reckon the spaceship car battery episode wouldve been the "WMDs" fiasco Lmfao!
5003 2018-10-26 19:57:27 You are faced with reality of life now. Corruption put more money in the economy prior to Buhari. You think that's the best thing for the country. Free stolen oil money...that is a short term benefit with along term consequence. You can't eat your cake and have it. Corruption!!!
5004 2018-10-26 19:57:10 Especially as it’s in oil.

5006 2018-10-26 19:57:02 Hello @realDdoubleD! We would recommend to turn your mixer on once to twice a month to speed 10 for two minutes. This will help to evenly distribute the oil inside the the motor head. This will also help to reduce the amount of oil leaking. Thank you -Cody
5007 2018-10-26 19:56:46 I can cycle through it, but every time I start the car, that message is there.  Prodding me.  Testing me.  Imploring me to get that oil changed before something bad happens...
5008 2018-10-26 19:56:44 Coconut oil?
5009 2018-10-26 19:56:41 This makes so much sense in so many ways. One could partner (early) with First Nations to build the pipeline and the port. The land is ‘undeveloped’ and isolated, so no urban conflicts. The oil could go anywhere, including Canadian east coast refineries.
5010 2018-10-26 19:56:35 We are going to need that rev it to payoff Rat Falls for the next 50 years Jim. That on top of @ $13 Bn debt and 18 cent light bills will require the oil rev & then some. What will pay for the stuff you are talking about now, then. Which hospital will go first? #nlpoli
5011 2018-10-26 19:56:31 Never been to South City, but I suspect their VIP rooms rent to be over 35,000 per day.  So at Ziauddin Hospital a VIP room with Honey and Olive oil surely be at 35,000 per day
5012 2018-10-26 19:56:29 That money they used to send zim cricket on tour could have gone to greater use. Like buying cooking oil 
5013 2018-10-26 19:56:29 Things that help calm the nerves:

~ herbal teas
~ grounding techniques: a frozen water bottle against your neck and chest (helpful during panic attacks), lavender oil, soft blanket, soft lighting, music.
~ guided meditation (difficult during peak panic attack, don't force it)
5014 2018-10-26 19:56:04 No, but Standard Oil did have a monopoly on oil products, without the help of of government regulation.

The fact that others caught up to them later was due to the unique circumstances; after all, anyone could drill for oil.

Many resources aren't like that.
5015 2018-10-26 19:56:02 I adore both my kids but one tends to take a lot of space and the other just gets on with it so I have to always remember 

The the quiet wheel needs oil too
5016 2018-10-26 19:55:54 Reason is Oil, to really  spank saudis any nation would risk oil shutoffs/production cuts.  Be assured if they had no oil..they would be spanked hard

5024 2018-10-26 19:54:32 Sorry for writing this unclearly. Shu'aytat joined JaN because they feared the rise of IS would endanger their oil revenues.
However, indivuduals of the tribe may have joined IS over the course of the war.
5025 2018-10-26 19:54:30 Me: *getting an oil change all by myself for the first time today*

5030 2018-10-26 19:54:14 So not too tight for freighters, BC Ferries, cruise ships, etc. But dangerously tight for oil tanker. No bias there at all.
5031 2018-10-26 19:54:09 Yes. Grate up the potatoes real thin.  Get a Teflon skillet real hot with light olive oil.  Season with some salt and pepper and cook to the amount of crunch you like. Simple but easy.

5034 2018-10-26 19:53:48 You are reading it improperly. The average “Saskatchewan” household would be $200 better off. Who is paying for it? Perhaps one of their top resource sectors, oil and coal? Do you seriously not understand how this tax works?

5043 2018-10-26 19:51:50 I'll strongly suggest that you include in the document policies, procedures and processes to ensure that there is a system in place to ensures that the exact quantity of crude oil and gas extracted from nations oil reserve on a daily basis is ascertained. It is the game changer.

I'm keeping my eye out for one just like it because I still spent less per month than a lease.

5094 2018-10-26 19:46:24 (2/2)  Precise answer to oil & vinegar problem Val first brought up is a bit tricky because it's a transient & the initial conditions are unknown.  Most plausible: just after shaking is finished, pressure at the bottom is LOWER because denser vinegar accelerates down.

5118 2018-10-26 19:44:02 See you need to add an Irish Wolfhound to the pack, for the reaching things on high shelves.

Grab an oil filter wrench thingy from an auto supply store for opening jars. Slightly easier on arthritic hands cause you get leverage. Used one when I was single.
5119 2018-10-26 19:44:02 Oil has to be HOT. Hard to do on an electric range. Any kind of a slicer or grater helps. Watch the fingers!

5132 2018-10-26 19:41:57 Saudi Arabia is the true location of the Willy Wonka factory.  Trump just continues to pump out Golden tickets to them.  They really can perform any atrocity on the world, and somehow (cough, oil) they get forgiveness and forgetfulness nearly instantly afterwards.

Do you know USA produced more oil than Russia for the 1st x since 1999?

Do you know  45 got Germany to stop getting natural gas only from Russia?

5146 2018-10-26 19:40:20 Oil would go for it...but then again...this is PC we are talking about...so maybe Draisaitl and Larson for Shattenkirk and Namestnikov? Based on recent trades I don't think it's completely out of the realm of possibility.

5152 2018-10-26 19:39:51 It drifts between both extremes. For the past half-century, the oil industry in Nigeria has contributed to the growth of the economy in no small measure, so it is an exact truism.

5156 2018-10-26 19:39:13 @realDonaldTrump I hope that China, India, and Europe cut off their oil, if they are granted a full exemption, they will all understand, and this will never be in your interest, I warned you earlier about what consequences it would have.

5158 2018-10-26 19:39:09 You going to drill for oil right in the middle of it?  Selling it off to the highest corporate bidder? Going to dig it up for the minerals? I can't wait!

5162 2018-10-26 19:38:50 It could have been the reason, but there is where he fails. Geology and resource development is quite different in both countries. Also decisions made by state-run oil companies during the low price cycle

5171 2018-10-26 19:37:03 It probably won’t be an overstatement in a few years to come as the process of getting revenue has shifted from the oil industry to other sectors
5172 2018-10-26 19:36:38 I am not good at convincing people  what should be obvious to a person of average intelligence. The pipeline is a no-brainer project that we should not be wasting time discussing. Dig the damn thing in the ground and have the oil flowing. Simple.

5174 2018-10-26 19:36:22 Quite a few cars do that now, has to be hell on the starter and bearings as well, how many times can a car start with no oil pressure before something fails. Used to be when you started trip, now every stop sign, traffic light?

5209 2018-10-26 19:31:55 Until it is proven that the extraction of oil from under the ocean floor doesn't increase thermal transfer rates and volume, all drilling within the planets interconnected aquatic structure should be banned or highly regulated.

5212 2018-10-26 19:31:23 No-one wants to “shut down” development. They want to make sure we don’t have a Gulf of Mexico devastation. The oil industry wants us to pay them to take our resources. Why do they deserve “fiscal certainty” when small Alaska businesses or residents can’t dream of that.
5213 2018-10-26 19:31:19 I don't think omitting information on purpose can be called 'honest analysis'. And I don't think he knows  about the oil industry more than anybody in the world. He has been proven right, that's true, which does not mean he can't be wrong this time

5222 2018-10-26 19:30:00 No, I gave you the truth, the good & bad. If I did that for Trump it would have been for the most part bad. The bubble has burst and it gets worse as he strips you of affordable HC, clean air, water, more fracking & oil drilling. lost world prestige, tariffs. Lots yet to come.

5228 2018-10-26 19:29:17 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.
5229 2018-10-26 19:29:12 No I’m not. I pulled sweet crude out. The 2.7 is the figure from oil sands heavy ONLY and I verified the BPD from four different resources. Nice try
5230 2018-10-26 19:28:55 Teething seems to be the theme of the week.  Do you have a little one going through the discomforts of teething?  We certainly have some solutions for you.  We have teething toys, teething jewelry, teething oil, teething necklaces and more!

5235 2018-10-26 19:28:19 The Oil industry has been described as the backbone of Nigeria’s economy. Is this an

5236 2018-10-26 19:28:05 Honestly can’t hate on car guys anymore. My new homie changed my oil for free, just had to smoke him out. He can talk about horsepower and engines all day idgaf, I don’t know what the hell he’s talking about, but ya girl respects it.

5240 2018-10-26 19:27:41 Haha is Egypt pumping out over 10 million barrels of oil and selling the US 800K barrels a day? If not I wouldn’t push my luck if I was El-Sisi

5251 2018-10-26 19:26:09 It would not surprise me to find out this guy was a non-cancer pro tobacco supporter a couple decades ago. Many of these "Advisers and Experts" sell their opinions to big tobacco and big oil to make their living.
5252 2018-10-26 19:25:58 And then the land, water and air gets poisoned by the toxic materials in their batteries (more toxic than CO2 and Methane) and our planet dies from the “green” movement (faster, and less manageable, than it would’ve by oil and gas pollutants).

5259 2018-10-26 19:25:23 Stovies are the greatest comfort food ever made. Actually, the greatest food. 

Spuds (sliced thin-ish), onion, marmite (& some stock, though marmite is the key player), and heaps of fat (oil, butter, lard...it’s flexible). Cook for ages until the potatoes are soft & flavourful.

5268 2018-10-26 19:24:23 This irks me because they use opposite cooking methods! Turkey is best cooked slow in brine, while octopus is best cooked quickly in oil!
5269 2018-10-26 19:24:17 It’s so creepy! My oil change is overdue because I was so uncomfortable at the last one I don’t want to go get it done

5271 2018-10-26 19:24:08 As a child, I greatly enjoyed the sands, sea-shells and life-filled tide pools of our coast. Later, on Koah Tao Island, Thailand I volunteered cleaning up oil spills from the tankers off shore. May green policies save us from this fate!
5272 2018-10-26 19:23:38 I went and got oil
5273 2018-10-26 19:23:02 @HaydnSchneider my knees and ankles are in so much pain when try to exercise (and the day after) coz my prepregnancy tiny body is now very large after baby. My knees and ankles can’t carry me it seems. Will yalls oil help me?
5274 2018-10-26 19:22:48 I’ve done it twice, it was impossible to do honestly either time, and the second time the trainer couldn’t actually pin me (or 2 others of the 6 on the course) down to any type. Total snake oil.

5276 2018-10-26 19:22:43 I like real mayo and olive oil mayo in very specific circumstances!! Pickles are a crisp refreshing snack!!!
5277 2018-10-26 19:22:39 This is all a very blatant attack on Tesla. Elon Musk has made big oil obsolete in the everyday lives of people. These childish efforts to stop him are futile.
5278 2018-10-26 19:22:34 - really don’t wanna wait on getting this oil change , but imma have too 
5279 2018-10-26 19:22:05 I believe canola is American for rapeseed.  The US administration doesn’t like to talk about rape.  I buy cold pressed UK rapeseed oil.

5311 2018-10-26 19:18:37 Disclosure: my degree was in geology. Using gas instead of coal and oil reduces CO2 quite a bit, which is the fracking point. But really, we should have been weaning off fossil fuels decades ago, and could have.
5312 2018-10-26 19:18:31 At this point my body has got to be at least 65% olive oil. I have a problem..
5313 2018-10-26 19:18:18 Yep. Agree with this. Type of oil not important (same as potatoes) but depends on your preference for taste.
5314 2018-10-26 19:18:10 Calling it “oil on canvas” seems like kind of a stretch to me.

5319 2018-10-26 19:17:36 The "Both sides are responsible for the current climate" arguments this week are only valid in the sense that your neighbor's failure to recycle and the Exxon-Valdez oil spill were both bad for the environment.

The comparatively short lifetime of Bitcoin alone makes it much more likely to suffer unforeseen problems than e.g. gold or oil, so while not exact you could rank/estimate relative risks.

5356 2018-10-26 19:12:14 do it in a bathroom or like park or something where people arent at  thats what me and my boy gotta do too my dude 
5357 2018-10-26 19:12:11 Well if you won't acknowledge facts.... US oil production increased and we were less energy dependent when Obama left office than when he began. US is the only wealthy, industrialized nation without a universal health care system. Facts. On everything else agree to disagree
5358 2018-10-26 19:12:01 Cadbury's are owned by Kraft now and use less milk and more veg oil...
5359 2018-10-26 19:11:32 Pdpigs projects that you can't complete for 16yrs wit boom in oil price and someone completed it and you are here ranting like a mad dog
5360 2018-10-26 19:11:24 I can still taste CBD oil in my mouth
5361 2018-10-26 19:11:11 I put CBD oil on my knees and they don't fucking hurt
5362 2018-10-26 19:11:07 Well hopefully a deal can be struck. Or maybe oil and gas saves use once again. You’re taking it at the angle that I’m pro PC here and using it to make excuses for the Liberals. The thing is that they all need to do better.
5363 2018-10-26 19:11:04 Schmidt's is a good brand. Or you can make your own with coconut oil, baking soda, cornstarch, arrowroot powder and a few drops of essential oils. Tea tree and lavender are good for underarms! Been doing this for years
5364 2018-10-26 19:10:56 avocado oil is a godsend use it!!
5365 2018-10-26 19:10:54 Back home crawling, good in the oil, off the card #homies

5368 2018-10-26 19:10:45 Today I'm serving underground, mystical mustard oil realness.
5369 2018-10-26 19:10:35 Wear less makeup & always wash your face before bed. Cetaphil face cleaner + witch hazel AM & PM. Try argon or vitamin e/c serum before bed (helps get rid of redness & brighten face). This routine SAVED me. Also, take primrose oil supplements. It helps with hormonal breakouts.
5370 2018-10-26 19:10:30 The point is - are we travelling efficiently or are we grabbed by the balls by very rapacious oil companies and forced into a ridiculous rat race. Don’t you want to understand what I’m saying?
5371 2018-10-26 19:10:10 hahaha I enjoyed that screen cap. Heaven FORBID a man be angry at a heinous false accusation attempting to derail his career.
5372 2018-10-26 19:10:08 Marinade the chicken in oil, Cajun spice and fresh coriander. When it's newly cooked add sweet chilli sauce. Job done!

5378 2018-10-26 19:09:13 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it

5380 2018-10-26 19:08:55 I think some academics are wary about writing in a way that might portray them as snake oil salesmen. The nuances of research are almost always lost in translation to popular science.

5385 2018-10-26 19:07:50 Overnight coconut oil protects your scalp and doesn’t itch terribly while it’s processing. When bleaching start from middle down then do your roots. It won’t be blonde enough in one go so don’t leave it in too long because you’ll have to do it all again anyway no matter what
5386 2018-10-26 19:07:49 But the Democratic Party and other radical leftist in this country have been have remained steadfastly against nuclear energy for the past sixty years . They obviously like all the CO2 gas that oil produces .
5387 2018-10-26 19:07:46 They even said global oil prices to $100; shey Na PMB dey regulate oil prices ni.  for them o
5388 2018-10-26 19:07:35 My coworker just asked me if I had some Holy oil on me. That says a lot for her to ask me that 
5389 2018-10-26 19:07:33 I think he deserves a kick in the nuts from EVERY oil and Gas Worker in BC and Alberta. Because they certainly don’t get a pension when he was part of the problem for them losing their job
5390 2018-10-26 19:07:31 Public of the country gave you the power. And you made it a joke. Remember how you laughed with the banner? Remember oil prices became a joke to you? This is the answer. Digest it!

5393 2018-10-26 19:06:59 Livingroom smells like Rem Oil now... let's see if this thing is any smoother than when dad gave it to me.
5394 2018-10-26 19:06:52 all  that country has is oil...nothing else.
5395 2018-10-26 19:06:38 I would like to buy oil from Swiss but there is none. My phone is LG. South Korean brand but was made in PRC. Is there any phone that was made in other country than in China?
5396 2018-10-26 19:06:25 They had time to build modular refineries instead they spent it looking for crude oil in the north east.
They had time for viable infrastructural development, but they wallowed in propaganda.
Oya, jail looters. Nepotism ensured they used incompetent judges.
5397 2018-10-26 19:06:08 Lancôme Teint idole ultra wear  I wore that one during summer cause it didn’t let my oil peep thru its pretty good & full coverage but doesn’t feel heavy! & if you don’t like it you can always return or exchange 
5398 2018-10-26 19:06:07 Mama mo oil 
5399 2018-10-26 19:05:59 As long as the House of Saud kissis "Israel" ass & ONLY sell oil in Dollar$ uncle Sam will always be A OK, besides it's hilarious when the USA tries to take the moral high ground on human rights etc!!
5400 2018-10-26 19:05:54 I find it bizarre that Donald Trump attacks globalism when corporations have no national loyalty and are the biggest supporters of globalism and that includes the oil and finance industries.

If Stephen Miller is writing Trump's globalism speeches, Trump needs a new writer
5401 2018-10-26 19:05:46 My first week here, someone asked what products I used in my hair. I was like none right now, just water and oil. Had the nerve to press me and was like "it looks like you have product in your hair"
5402 2018-10-26 19:05:35 Of all the things I have learned about our shelter cat, Finn, the fact that he goes wild for coconut oil has been the most surprising - and means buying more for cooking after he had his head in the jar licking it while I was tending to my tattoo...
5403 2018-10-26 19:05:15 Economy: The romans were really rich because they had a lot of trade they sold slaves to other people and they had the best economy they made there money from olive oil they got a lot of trade from china it was mostly slave based economy there money was called dinarri.
5404 2018-10-26 19:05:09 Some assumed the same of me, and yet here I am, burning the midnight oil to bring about Tarmon Gaidon, which, now that I think on it, sounds a lot like Armageddon... 

Was the Creator out of ideas and decided our Apocalypse should be similar in sound for the plebs?
5405 2018-10-26 19:05:06 Finally getting my oil changed
5406 2018-10-26 19:05:05 Your plan is not enough.  Not nearly enough.  Stop using Palm oil and promote reforestation.
5407 2018-10-26 19:04:48 No.2 oil and pizza really compliment each other
5408 2018-10-26 19:04:46 End global oil demand and US dollar collapses. Trying to break free from Petro dollar cost Gaddafi his life (among others). Must end central banking system and their fiat printing criminal enterprise and move to decentralized digital assets.
5409 2018-10-26 19:04:42 Graduate of A&M, worked in oil industry, Captain in the Air Force flying the C130 Herc, as governor led Texas to the US leader in solar and wind power production and usage, funded the development of NG engine developed at A&M... he's more qualified than all democrats combined.
5410 2018-10-26 19:04:38 Oil pastel rubbings, paper weaving, color techniques, and paint exploration! These are all of the wonderful things that Ms. Sarah does with CDS students during art!
5411 2018-10-26 19:04:25 so yall don't use oil to prevent the sap from sticking to your hands? aa
5412 2018-10-26 19:04:13 The moment you realise the #BBC Licence Fee is totally justified.  Cookery competition on #BBC2 "The contestants must remember not to have the oil too hot, or they will burn the fishcakes".  
5413 2018-10-26 19:04:10 Rip workout but I needed to do laundry and get a oil change anyway

5415 2018-10-26 19:04:03 All is well here in the oil patch of NM. If I can swing it on our east coast trip, I’ll have to get a putting lesson from you or round at your course 
5416 2018-10-26 19:04:03 Actually, those T-Shirts are always available. - IT’s the Nightmare on Oil Street that’s limited production. (The other ones get a new batch after the old one ends)
5417 2018-10-26 19:04:02 God bless you as you help him
5418 2018-10-26 19:03:51 you tweet about losing bum hair and asking for a good hair oil you moist guy, are you on job tho??
5419 2018-10-26 19:03:50 Big Oil is fighting state climate initiatives with big piles of money - Vox - Vox
5420 2018-10-26 19:03:44 Obama's plan opened up drilling on the east coast, Alaska & the Gulf. US oil production grew from 5.1 million barrels a day when Obama took office in January 2009 to 8.9 million barrels a day by April 2016, a 74% increase. In 2015, U.S. oil production was at a 43-year high.
5421 2018-10-26 19:03:39 Can someone sponsor me hair products coz I’m living of coconut oil 
5422 2018-10-26 19:03:36 Everyone knows about the Saudis and oil. Fewer people know the following, and it's very important. 

Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest arms importer.
5423 2018-10-26 19:03:29 Ohh ok
5424 2018-10-26 19:03:20 Just my favorite shots of oil in the last
5425 2018-10-26 19:03:20 After I replaced my pcv valve, cleaned my air intake tube, changed my oil and washed my big baby sav, she’s running and breathing soooooo smooth 
5426 2018-10-26 19:03:17 That’s what I usually do, but this time just salt, pepper, garlic and olive oil. It was fabulous!
5427 2018-10-26 19:03:04 Si es de telepiu y telepiu es de oil y oil es de YPF. C5N es de YPF?? Eso entendí yo.
5428 2018-10-26 19:02:52 I was reading about alternative diesel fuels and discovered that ships often burn reclaimed motor oil and industrial waste oils. All of which contain heavy metals and release ass-tons of carbon.
5429 2018-10-26 19:02:48 I truly like Kale, sauteed in oil & garlic or in soup.
5430 2018-10-26 19:02:43 For mascara I’ve used coconut oil on a cloth, and I recently got a Norwex make up remover cloth my mom suggested, both have worked really well for me! And I just wash my face after with my normal face wash to get the rest of the coconut oil off

How to get 90 % oil with this wax ? Can this wax be ingested as is to cure a serious illness ?
5433 2018-10-26 19:02:26 The tin no funny at all
5434 2018-10-26 19:02:16 Ha! Good one. You parody the pro oil crowd sooo well!
5435 2018-10-26 19:02:06 And press anti Trump rhetoric is worse. 
They are biased. They do mislead and misinform as well as make stuff up and outright lie.
Pointing out the obvious is not an incitement to violence. 
@BilldeBlasio didn't call for "toning down," until dimms targeted
5436 2018-10-26 19:02:05 Wait you cant, go from not the Gulf to the environment is the environment. Obama was trying to preserve America's environment. US financing Brazil's oil exploration is a good investment for the US (a loan has to be repaid with interest). And your article is from 2009......
5437 2018-10-26 19:02:03 He just stole a huge oil deal via Germany away from Russia and towards US nat gas instead, how is that embracing Russia???  You and your brother are so mis-informed and beligerant it’s not even a little funny, it’s sad.
5438 2018-10-26 19:02:03 As an arachnophob, my best advice...peppermint/peppermint oil. Be advised, if you have Cats, that peppermint is toxic to cats if consumed in large quantities.  But it keeps the 8 legged aminals out.

5440 2018-10-26 19:01:58 I’ve tried everything. Various strains, edibles, CBD oil, etc..did NOT help. To be honest, it made the pain in my legs worse. It amplified the restlessness, burning/aching. It was awful. I was bummed out it didn’t help because it would have been a nice back-up for pain relief.
5441 2018-10-26 19:01:57 Kale with onion and garlic in olive oil.
Ymmmmmnn
5442 2018-10-26 19:01:52 As does @pettersen4co @Story4CO @jessiedanielson while @RochelleGalindo continues to claim she’s “neutral,” but has always voted in opposition of oil & gas.
5443 2018-10-26 19:01:45 Yeah "maybe" it "might" be a good idea to leave any oil deposits remain in the earth

5446 2018-10-26 19:01:21 Understand what they are used for, A fire blanket is very effective for smothering flames, You can use a fire blanket to cover a pan of burning cooking oil or burning clothes on a child, Fire blanket contains display instructions for their use,

5451 2018-10-26 19:00:33 This one is mad ooo
5452 2018-10-26 19:00:23 Probably because of peak oil.  They don't know what to invest in next.  Electric cars still have hurdles that gas cars don't.  Solar and Wind maybe good, but they need to hire new staff.  Do a turn-around.

5457 2018-10-26 18:59:47 Yeaaaah you need warm oil and a spatula lol
5458 2018-10-26 18:59:46 Reagan also bailed out the UAW in the 80's or they wouldn't have been able to bankrupt the auto industry in the 2000's. Jimmy Carter's claim of 10 years worth of oil left helped with that. 99% of scientist agreed. the lying oil companies did not. we must be out of oil.
5459 2018-10-26 18:59:44 Now if we could sell our oil for more than 76 cents and actually send it somewhere that would be awesome!!!!!! 
5460 2018-10-26 18:59:42 She dey my front fr ATM queue

5467 2018-10-26 18:58:44 It is , am waiting for my dad to come back and other mosque committee members to see what we can do for him
5468 2018-10-26 18:58:41 I agree that cbd oil and/or anti cancerous veggies would be worth a try.  Meat, especially processed, is a carcinogen.  Best wishes on your journey,  you can beat it!!
5469 2018-10-26 18:58:34 Um looks like those are oil rubbed brass knobs aka compromise because they are dark.
5470 2018-10-26 18:58:23 I also use the coconut oil & Shea butter on my skin in the winter but it seems to make my skin feel & look even more dry... is there a specific brand you use?
5471 2018-10-26 18:57:53 Is it stuck to your leg? Lmao warm baby oil will get it off...or Lowe’s and Home Depot has goo gone

5477 2018-10-26 18:56:58 Weed is what you need. Cannabis cures. CBD oil for your joints. And pain relief. I'd recommend a water distiller too. We are 70% that. No water on earth is clean. Urine therapy is also worth investigating. (The world is a lie.) &
5478 2018-10-26 18:56:55 Black people cant use all lotions! Certain lotions be leaving me all Ashy looking. No, no get me some essential oil or some Jergens!
5479 2018-10-26 18:56:40 I’m scared of hot oil 
5480 2018-10-26 18:56:36 America is now an exporter of energy.  It NEEDS markets to peddle its oil.  What makes you think it is depended on Iran for energy.  The neo-con swine, Bolton's actions against Iran do not stem out of America's supposed need for oil.  It has to do with israel.
5481 2018-10-26 18:56:14 We've tried a number of different things, and he's now using Cannabis oil, with the Immunotherapy and I'm trying to eat more vegetables and fruits. He stopped Dairy and Sugar a while ago now. I haven't heard of that, so I'll look at that as well....
5482 2018-10-26 18:56:09 Put baby oil on ur face before a foundation bitchhhh I can breath now.
5483 2018-10-26 18:56:02 That’s what happens when you don’t change the oil.
5484 2018-10-26 18:55:53 I take a dose every morning and night (oil under my tongue)...keeps my anxiety completely down! My hair was falling out from anxiety and prescriptions made me feel awful. Cbd has been a lifesaver!
5485 2018-10-26 18:55:49 So I went to get an oil change done today& my car is in my dads name so when they called me to tell me my car was ready the guy yelled out for “Thomas” and I stood up to go get my keys and everyone in the room looked at me like I was stupid because they thought my name was Thomas
5486 2018-10-26 18:55:48 I can't believe Big Oil is paying for the FBI to investigate. 

Every day we get closer to the singularity when Trump and Musk tweet at each other. They both hate the FBI so we have that...

5506 2018-10-26 18:52:36 Tips with nose piercings- tea tree oil is amazing with the healing process. You can also make a mixture of coconut oil and tea tree oil, it’s like a lotion in a way but still very helpful. Keloids can form on the nose so be careful, just switch to a stud piercing and not a ring.

5572 2018-10-26 18:43:41 I'd like to crunch the numbers on this before saying it's that great, but given that shipping lanes in the Arctic are more navigable, compressing LNG/LPG for transport closer to where you drill for it makes sense.  Crude oil, same, if shipping it from the Arctic is practical.

5631 2018-10-26 18:37:19 The Skeleton is obviously made from plastic, which is made from oil.
So he is even past the fossil fuel part
5632 2018-10-26 18:37:16 I wonder if the CEOS of the oil industry would support the mass exodus of people  from using cars back to the old days of horse and buggy? I guess the Liberals would then tax us for the disposal of horse manure. The Liberals will always find a way to tax us to oblivion!

5635 2018-10-26 18:36:31 I’m just saying we can take some of that money that we use for war (which is honestly not necessary bc were just waging wars for oil, staging foreign dictatorships after we already fund them w money and weapons etc) and use it for healthcare, education etc that’ll actually

5644 2018-10-26 18:35:52 My family has been drilling essential oil on our land for generations. The eucalyptus derrick ran dry in 1912, but we dab some orange blossom on our temples and focus on the good times.
5645 2018-10-26 18:35:51 Évidemment  trop cher en  
Le  gas oil  doit être au prix que l'essence  question d'équité.  Après ce sont aux véhicules de  consommer moins
5646 2018-10-26 18:35:46 I use it without liner and it is fine. You’ll need some oil to take it off at night; just use whatever oil you cook with. Drawback is that it can feel very dry, so you do want your lips to be not-chapped. Scrub with a bit of sugar and wear extra chapstick the night before.
5647 2018-10-26 18:35:43 That stat they’ve just shown on Sky is criminal. This is the last time I’m going to moan about Bruce, but what a negative, turgid legacy he’s left behind. Whatever happens over the next few months, you’ve got to give Smith time. It’s like turning round an oil tanker. #avfc

5649 2018-10-26 18:35:35 peppermint oil works great, another alternative would be a bit of tea tree oil & water spray around the perimeter of your house /deck. Spiders are very sensitive to strong smells, their lungs are located on the bottom sides of bodies. Peppermint oil works for various animals

5653 2018-10-26 18:35:05 So I couldn’t sleep last night (was out of CBD oil) so I did the following things:
*started writing next book synopsis 
*had and plotted a new book idea
*planned grocery trip
*panicked about at least five things
5654 2018-10-26 18:34:43 Today I am ignoring homework, putting oil in my Jeep, turning off my phone and me and captain are just gonna drive until we find somewhere to hike.

5659 2018-10-26 18:34:08 Ladies, make sure you check your oil BEFORE you start your car in the morning. The oil has to be settled to be accurate when checking. Don’t be out here embarrassing our gender with locked up engines.
5660 2018-10-26 18:34:04 WSJ, SEC, FBI is not reputable huh? Working with Big Oil and Chanos?
5661 2018-10-26 18:33:43 if trump continues in his ways, he'll nominate the magat bomber for head of the BATF (like putting oil lobbyist pruitt as head of the EPA)
5662 2018-10-26 18:33:41 I think it’s time to switch to oil paint. Watercolor paint has been kinda restricting with the mood I’ve been in lately.
5663 2018-10-26 18:33:27 Conservative meaning... we love Jesus more money or oil or p___y grabbin spies, liers and cheats or the converse.
5664 2018-10-26 18:32:50 So they want to divest energy stocks because oil is bad, but then increase investment in a petro-state with vast human rights abuses...
5665 2018-10-26 18:32:49 Is your definition of the "world straightening out" meaning different governments in power or a return of high oil/gas prices or...? Not sure if we can depend on either of those happening, so how do we keep rollin'?
5666 2018-10-26 18:32:45 Build all those God damned pipelines and get the oil moving to market, Jesus Christ what is wrong with people these days.  I am tired of the tail wagging he dog in this Country !!!

5686 2018-10-26 18:30:12 Petroleum, or crude oil, forms when tiny little sea animals and plants die and then get mixed up with sand and slit on the sea floors.
5687 2018-10-26 18:30:11 As a Coloradan who was a County Commissioner, ran for U.S. Senate & Congress, I don’t think CO can save America when the Democrats mentioned like Hickenlooper Bennet & Salazar are beholden to oil & gas. The IPCC’s climate change report said we need to get off fossil fuels ASAP.

5694 2018-10-26 18:29:46 Well that’s just what Ralph did cut education, cut health care no infrastructure brought in his oil friends. Absolutely no vision of city building or planning for future, heritage trust fund ha! All BS that people like you bought!
5695 2018-10-26 18:29:37 And that's why we need to get rid of coal and oil businesses!
5696 2018-10-26 18:29:32 Budgetary contribution from oil had to be compensated! Did Modi take home the money? Forget commo man, t MMS a Harvard economist was not able to figure it! State share increases as crude shoots!

5718 2018-10-26 18:27:24 @tundefashola GEJ diversified from oil sector to the non-oil sector and the revenue from that sector was over 30% by 2013. He didn’t stifle the non-oil sector like the way your lifeless boss did.

5720 2018-10-26 18:27:10 Use coconut oil immediately after you shave it will not cause irritation it helps

5722 2018-10-26 18:27:00 Oil konsa use kia he
5723 2018-10-26 18:26:59 Yes. And also stop oil production.  We have other ways to eat. We have other ways to produce energy.  But thank god we have someone who is not denying environmental importance anymore.
5724 2018-10-26 18:26:53 I just mistook a Bowling Commercial for an oil rig tune up commercial... Because they have those....
5725 2018-10-26 18:26:52 I am sure he will be hawking the Magic Oil on infomercials in the near future.
5726 2018-10-26 18:26:42 Yea burning out of oil now would not be good lol.
5727 2018-10-26 18:26:38 I wish your side would stop with accusation that everyone is bought by oil. There are too many people that question or deny global warming now. A lot of people simply don't believe it and that should be akwnoledged, not trivially dismissed away.
5728 2018-10-26 18:26:26 I think he'll get into a few more than 20, as most starters get pulled a few times every year,  but do think he'll start 20. At most I had him down for 2 starts in October.

5770 2018-10-26 18:21:27 Spending my lunch break getting an oil change 
5771 2018-10-26 18:21:21 you think he'll play 20?:)
5772 2018-10-26 18:21:12 It's kinda like working on an oil rig: you make bank but everyone just kinda keeps their distance from you
5773 2018-10-26 18:21:01 3ndek el mane and tail bl olive oil?
5774 2018-10-26 18:20:50 In an ideal world you have two $3-3.5M goalies playing 41 games each.
5775 2018-10-26 18:20:45 People have died touching Hydrogens
Nations wiped out for selling their oil outside petro dollar

I not in business to disrespect or disturb President Donald Trump
5776 2018-10-26 18:20:31 Frm Oil blocks.....
5777 2018-10-26 18:20:28 I hate taking my own car to get an oil change
5778 2018-10-26 18:20:22 Thanks Shannon! Oil-and-gas case over the interpretation of a large lease.
5779 2018-10-26 18:20:21 So I’m getting my oil changed right? Hey let’s go to the diner next door for a late lunch. Should be chill, check some emails.. ONCE SEATED THE WAITRESS INFORMS ME OF A WEDDING CEREMONY HAPPENING IN  THE DINING ROOM IN 10 MINS.

5781 2018-10-26 18:20:13 True Diversification … market correlations S&P vs. 10-Yr. Notes (-0.35), Euro (0.16), Crude Oil (0.25), Gold (-0.21)
5782 2018-10-26 18:20:01 If you really want to make a stand against oil - go hydrogen/electric and solar
5783 2018-10-26 18:19:38 ? Scorching hot oil/lard and a hot oven - that was my mom's method. Never made them myself.
5784 2018-10-26 18:19:29 Made THC oil yesterday... smoked a blunt and cooked some eggs with it... about an hour later I started vibrating.

5786 2018-10-26 18:19:22 Olive oil and white wine?!?!? Uhh, yeah! Two of my favorite things from bottles! This looks easy enough that even I can't mess it up! 
Thank you for sharing the recipe! 
Enjoy the snack!

5790 2018-10-26 18:19:11 @ElementalWell Hi, do you guys have RSO oil ? I look your menu and did not see it ?
5791 2018-10-26 18:19:08 Colorado is one of the most corrupt states in the u.s. oil industry is literally calling all the shots here along with big banking. Majority of politicians are bought and paid. Denver and surrounding areas are almost completely gerrymandered and the homeless rate is astronomical
5792 2018-10-26 18:19:05 I put argan oil in my hair and my hair still sucks. What now
5793 2018-10-26 18:19:04 They created fear and a good excuse to invade another country that just happened to have lots of oil. And don't forget the Okla City bombing. Old Dem/Rino tricks, nothing new EXCEPT a lot of people are awake and we have someone powerful on OUR SIDE! #MAGA #REDWAVE #ILOVETRUMP
5794 2018-10-26 18:18:58 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
5795 2018-10-26 18:18:57 On a Drunk Elephant binge- trying the Beste cleanser and Framboos serum bc I love the eye cream, Marula face oil and mask! Also the Shisiedo MicroLiner Ink is  What did you get?
5796 2018-10-26 18:18:57 That feeling you get when you take your perfectly working car to VA @walmart for a simple oil change & it leaves on a tow truck because your technician messed it up and your employees tell us too bad! #walmartsucks @ConsumerReports @Reuters @nytimes @CNN @MarkHerringVA
5797 2018-10-26 18:18:55 Yeah because we love buy oil from other countries like Russia...
5798 2018-10-26 18:18:53 The oil it was enabled by lamps, and to lay stones too are removed they bring famine in snakes, except that serve as in vinegar;
5799 2018-10-26 18:18:51 God is pouring fresh oil out today @RuachConference!
5800 2018-10-26 18:18:39 รู้จักไม่ถึงปี โอเครดียอมรับเลย
5801 2018-10-26 18:18:39 น้องเพิร์ธคือเล่นดีมาก ดีมากๆ #lovebychanceseries
5802 2018-10-26 18:18:39 Give him extra $$ on a 1yr deal, hope he can prove his worth & sign Koskinen to a reasonable number to be the starter for a year or two beginning in  2019-20. IMO, it was a silly gamble considering the other flaws on the roster but that was the approach. 2/2
5803 2018-10-26 18:18:39 รำคาญ
5804 2018-10-26 18:18:39 It is said that sprinkling salt on the burn, Rahul is already burning and Varun is putting oil.
5805 2018-10-26 18:18:33 Other African countries are moving forward. But my own country is still celebrating false gianthood
5806 2018-10-26 18:18:25 Any further pollution of the Arctic will be impossible to mitigate ....oil spill effects will last for a generation or two. ..be careful !!
5807 2018-10-26 18:18:19 What an idiotic statement. Obviously there was no oil being burnt as Man didn't exist. What exactly the RM have even got to with this I'm not sure.
Where's your evidence that the planet is going to melt the poles regardless? (cont.)
5808 2018-10-26 18:18:10 Yes they deserve the congratulations! Well done but all that hadn’t happened when you had not started with hate and anger speeches! As you’re #UnfitToBePresident you don’t get it and pour more oil into the fire! #ResignNow #trumpisBIGGESTNationalSecurityThreat
5809 2018-10-26 18:18:00 I’m voting for @tedcruz as he supports the oil and gas industry. Ted supports families and loved ones in this industry. Robert Francis does not. Plain and simple.
5810 2018-10-26 18:17:54 And the snake oil Nancy? Is only  two dollars a bottle you say.  Crumbs you say.
5811 2018-10-26 18:17:52 ...an eel’s oil of water body...

5817 2018-10-26 18:17:19 Germany Releases Emergency Oil Reserve on Rhine Problems: WiWo

German government reacts to the historically low water level of the Rhine river, affecting the supply of crude oil products that are important for the economy, Wirtschaftswoche reports.
5818 2018-10-26 18:17:00 During #oilpulling, the oil gets emulsified and surface area of the oil gets increased….This oil will coat the teeth and gingiva and inhibits bacterial co-aggregration and plaque formation
5819 2018-10-26 18:16:56 Yes, let’s buy our gas from the Russians and our oil from the Saudis, what could possibly go wrong.
5820 2018-10-26 18:16:54 Raw is Just There Will Be Blood From The Oil's Perspective
5821 2018-10-26 18:16:50 Why is she dipping it into the oil omg 
5822 2018-10-26 18:16:40 Officially "too cold to do your own oil change" season 
5823 2018-10-26 18:16:35 gotta get a oil change next week, it’s mandatory
5824 2018-10-26 18:16:34 Back to when coal and oil ruled, when steel was cranked out in large quantities, and steel towns smelled like smelters, and the air was red with oxidized iron, making the residents sick with asthma at best?

5827 2018-10-26 18:16:15 Yes it’s major spider season in Wa right now! It will get better in a little bit. But if you do the peppermint oil a few times a week around your house it will totally help! Consistency is key!
5828 2018-10-26 18:16:08 Peppermint oil really does work 
5829 2018-10-26 18:16:08 If Talbot starts 50 & Koskinen 30 they'll each get the same $ per start. At least we now have confirmation that it won't be 80/0.
5830 2018-10-26 18:15:41 My brother used franch oil
5831 2018-10-26 18:15:30 Buckeye: Great for divination, good luck, attracting money and wealth, carry whole herb dip in money oil, wrap inside a dollar to have constant increase in cash flow.
5832 2018-10-26 18:15:22 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
5833 2018-10-26 18:15:19 Consumption methods of cannabis include:

5834 2018-10-26 18:15:17 That oil color turning black will take 8000km on regular car F1 car just one hour amazing
Great insight guys 
Keep them coming
5835 2018-10-26 18:15:14 Its just you do need to know a few things. For instance, my new leaf blower is 2-stroke, which means the gas needs to be mixed with oil. Hence the need for another gas can. Most engines are 4 stroke, which is like a car where gas and oil are separate.
5836 2018-10-26 18:15:08 Otsukare ma man ! I'm also gonna wait next chapter, dont want to burn out all my oil haha
5837 2018-10-26 18:15:06 Thank God for my boyfriend & this oil change he paying for

5840 2018-10-26 18:14:44 & body oil
5841 2018-10-26 18:14:28 Who else is going to stand up for big oil?
5842 2018-10-26 18:14:21 Jerry Falwell, Roger Ailes, Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich oil their cues from Ronald Reagan who got his from Kohn Birch Society( OK Maybe not ) and the Koch brothers have completed the circle 
5843 2018-10-26 18:14:18 Back in the day when you had carburetors in cars, you needed to let it warm up. Nowadays cars have fuel injectors to do the job, so you don’t need to let it warm up anymore. And if someone mentions “the oil has to warm up”... Nope. The oil now is light weight, so...
5844 2018-10-26 18:14:07 Modern Indians lack adequate and balanced nutrition as per ayurveda. Inadequate nutrition(eg.2c rice,0.5-1c mung, 0.25c sesame, 0.25c wheat, 0.25-0.5c oil), improper digestives(eg. excess salt,sour,use of red chili,tea,coffee), xcess sweets (proper-sweets with milk, before food)2
5845 2018-10-26 18:14:02 Spent 6k oil for the event, gonna do a small break #AzurLane
5846 2018-10-26 18:13:51 That oil is something ELSE
5847 2018-10-26 18:13:48 Pake pelembap sm olive oil jg bisa. Pilih skincare yang buat moist sih
5848 2018-10-26 18:13:24 People paid secretly by Monsanto (now Bayer) are usually easy to spot. Their  "arguments" are often a carbon copy of its press releases. Monsanto & the #GMO industry also use the same methods as Big Oil, creating & abetting false research & entire fake research communities.
5849 2018-10-26 18:12:47 $277 for breaks, $89 for a oil change  Fuuuuck, there goes my pocket change 
5850 2018-10-26 18:12:38 Who has Sunny Isle Argan Oil (or something similar) besides Peoples Pharmacy??
5851 2018-10-26 18:12:30 He was just dumbfounded, short of words, I don't even know
5852 2018-10-26 18:12:30 Crazy มีการ์ดมั๊ยคะ
5853 2018-10-26 18:12:25 Fuel...zero. Beer...zero.  Cooking oil....zero. Usd rate haywire! Price of 10kg mbeu $100. Please come down to earth
5854 2018-10-26 18:12:24 Big oil will put a stop to it, through our politicians, aging.
5855 2018-10-26 18:12:20 It’s too simple to credit socialism so much. Norway’s success is also thanks to a combination of Lutheran modesty, peasant parsimony, geographical determinism and ruthless pragmatism. Not to mention the oil and other natural resources.
5856 2018-10-26 18:12:10 Tmw Vic got locked into the Oil Rig when I set it to blow. Rest in piece Vic. You were a good bastard.
5857 2018-10-26 18:12:03 Oh and I double cleanse with an oil cleanser first to break makeup/dirt/pollutants down :’)
5858 2018-10-26 18:11:56 pake face oil, sheet mask, jangan lupa selalu pake pelembab

5861 2018-10-26 18:11:38 Has anyone tried @ZilisLLC Ultracell CBD oil? I am an ambassador and I am interested to find out what CBD oils work for you! I haven’t found anything better than Ultracell. What CBD do you like?
5862 2018-10-26 18:11:36 TFL UPDATE: TfLTrafficNews: There is an oil spillage, northbound Tunnel Avenue  just prior Blackwall Tunnel. Approach with caution.
5863 2018-10-26 18:11:36 That’s cool. But your company still messed up our car during an oil change. It’s currently sitting in your parking lot waiting for tow truck. Your store associates have done nothing! Left my daughter stranded with no way home. Unbelievable! You will be hearing from our attorney
5864 2018-10-26 18:11:32 5 days left to get into my draw for a free bottle of cbd oil or relief cream . must order from my website: message me
5865 2018-10-26 18:11:28 LOL. I"m sure that even a dead plant would provide more intelligent conversation. In any case, why are you wasting your time pining for your orange buffoon boyfriend when you should be thinking about how your country is going to handle running out of oil?
5866 2018-10-26 18:11:22 who is paying the WSJ for the absurd hit pieces ... inquiring minds want to know? Big OIL? Big auto? Is it legal? they have trillions on the line and they are FAILING big time. They have lost the war and now they are trying to fight dirty by deception. Follow the money ...
5867 2018-10-26 18:11:22 What is? Equities oil or both?
5868 2018-10-26 18:11:21 The heat recently can fry dodo
5869 2018-10-26 18:11:18 Daddy Alph lukau i know you will never ask me to pray for me but socks when i received a message from Facebook message that I need oil that i should pay  $380d
5870 2018-10-26 18:11:15 Anahi the baker plays a lute with a bottle of oil on it before painting a nimite or delphinium using gründerzeit
5871 2018-10-26 18:11:14 RELIGIOUSLY DEEP CLEANING AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK, chemical exfoliants (elf’s is by FAR my favorite), salicylic acid toner, rosehip, and vitamin e oil. Oh and the sun and well placed spot concealing and highlight lmao
5872 2018-10-26 18:11:07 Really? The BLM scum that has murdered police across this nation is conservative? The ELF punks that vandalize oil wells and pipelines are conservative? Get your facts straight before you bring nonsense rhetoric to a discussion
5873 2018-10-26 18:11:06 now that i got lavender oil i will absolutely never have anxiety again
5874 2018-10-26 18:11:00 ZEDOARY, distilled with common water, affords a thick and dense essential oil, which soon concretes of itself into a kind of camphor, and on this oil its virtues principally depend, It is a sudorific, and is much recommended by some in fevers, especially of the malignant kinds.
5875 2018-10-26 18:11:00 We love this @EatInEaling @DebaereUk
5876 2018-10-26 18:10:59 I like my North Dakota oil, thank you very much.
5877 2018-10-26 18:10:54 I would do unimaginable things for a nice oil massage. Like a full body hour massage with candles lit and some partynextdoor playing
5878 2018-10-26 18:10:46 Nowhere near the amount of smokers there were before it became unaffordable and if you deny that fact you live in la la land. It’s not like people can buy oil from the “black market” 
5879 2018-10-26 18:10:34 I get what you mean now. As far as Koskinen goes, he'll get his games but it was always going to be in the 20-25 range unless Talbot is bad. While I don't agree w/ the $2.5M I've always understood what they're trying to do. 1/2
5880 2018-10-26 18:10:33 In my opinion Johnny, the Canadian oil patch is grotesquely undervalued and the situation will be resolved in the near term but gives investors gifted openings. Accumulation phase that extends to mining and exploration which I am heavily involved in professionally. Opportunity
5881 2018-10-26 18:10:31 At the time the US needed the oil. Fracking changed the dynamic after that. Building a pipeline to tidewater would not have made sense.
5882 2018-10-26 18:10:24 Argh u no know say e cost , the aluminum glass plus all d kilishi , only d kilishi can reach 40k

5886 2018-10-26 18:10:11 Have you try to eat rice but its hard to go down your throat painful aa hell ...yes i did several occasions...could it be the  oil used to cook it with, could it be that the salt was added too early before the rice busted. Share your comments what say you ???
5887 2018-10-26 18:10:05 What you mean blood?
5888 2018-10-26 18:10:03 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
5889 2018-10-26 18:09:52 Mateen and klasra are liars and traitors. Paid by oil lobbyists who don't want cheaper LNG in the country. Engro is saving Pakistan.
5890 2018-10-26 18:09:46 While running out to pick up cake (thanks, bro!) I also got tic tacs. Why? Because CBD oil tastes gross so I need something to take that edge off
5891 2018-10-26 18:09:32 As pity-able this may sound it sounds funny too.    Lol kilishi?
5892 2018-10-26 18:09:19 An chuchesa

5894 2018-10-26 18:08:54 Lagos,,,!Lagos!!!!chai 
5895 2018-10-26 18:08:48 Went to get money out the bank and mom asked what it was so I told her to go do my belly button. She said, “you need an oil change, they’re the same price.” But this seems more fun to go get and I need alcohol so maybe I’ll try again next check
5896 2018-10-26 18:08:48 Spitting
5897 2018-10-26 18:08:47 Rupee fall is because of strengthening of dollar. Nothing to do with weak rupee. Budgetary allocation for welfare scheme like MNREGA has a x money coming from oil. So when crude fell to low can't afford to lose the revenue for state or forgo MNREGA/welfare schemes! Pity MMS
5898 2018-10-26 18:08:44 Lmaoo. Please. I've been told I'm picky.

You sef no dey see as this thing fit roundabout setting? Maggi cube even dey, make the gods use am. 

Na red oil remain.
5899 2018-10-26 18:08:28 Lets get this 1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
2-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons canola oil
6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups all-purpose flour
5900 2018-10-26 18:08:26 Peanut oil in vaccines.

5902 2018-10-26 18:08:12 But money for beard oil dey
5903 2018-10-26 18:08:08 I hope they have enough oil to finance free education
5904 2018-10-26 18:08:08 oil from ksa doesn't disappear if we choose not to buy it. it goes elsewhere and - empowers other terrible regimes sadly.
5905 2018-10-26 18:08:04 Truth is klasra and mateen are being paid by oil lobbyists who don't want LNG. Engro is a good company changing Thar
5906 2018-10-26 18:07:59 Bad day for an oil change ...
5907 2018-10-26 18:07:58 Massages  like yessss, the baby oil over there.
5908 2018-10-26 18:07:43 unfortunately we have a PSYCHO PRES that is out to destroy anything and everything in the way of oil search, fracking,hunting, etc....oh, forgot, the low income and poor humans..
5909 2018-10-26 18:07:41 I just fixed my truck and i already got an oil leak. FUCK
5910 2018-10-26 18:07:34 There is an oil spillage, northbound Tunnel Avenue  just prior Blackwall Tunnel. Approach with caution.
5911 2018-10-26 18:07:29 Damn you Big Oil!!
5912 2018-10-26 18:07:17 @tundefashola in case you don’t know I will tell you. GEJ came in at a time when global economic recession of 2008 caused weak demand for our oil with falling revenues.
5913 2018-10-26 18:07:09 I am. I need a new tire and oil change though. Gotta get that done
5914 2018-10-26 18:06:55 Someone’s oil in the kitchen decided to pop from the pot to my skin,unprovoked ..
5915 2018-10-26 18:06:27 There is no better time then now for the west to stand up to Saudi Arabia, a country that takes no issue with excecuting gay people and treating women like 2nd class class citizens. Stop selling them arms and stop using their oil!
5916 2018-10-26 18:06:23 Guy doing my oil change: You’ve got a nail in your tire
Me: okay what do I do
Guy: *Shrugs*
Wtf????
5917 2018-10-26 18:06:19 Make up removing oil? Vaseline ? Coconut oil? Cum???
5918 2018-10-26 18:06:10 Oil will be involved and it’s wrestling 
5919 2018-10-26 18:06:05 Also higher that that of the US (with oil&gas)? Anyway, what is the point you’re trying to make here?
5920 2018-10-26 18:06:04 I want everyone to know that @Walmart broke our car. Took it in for a simple oil change & now we are having it towed. At our expense! How hard should we sue them? Terrible company! Terrible service! Don’t trust them with your car!
5921 2018-10-26 18:05:55 Have it your way then; ...and all of this incurs transportation costs so that point is moot.

 Heavy oil price = $14.18
 Heavy oil price = $72.23

5922 2018-10-26 18:05:40 Yes na 
5923 2018-10-26 18:05:38 "Hi-yah!!"

With a kitty yell Vee karate chopped the gooey man thing. It didn't hurt but when she pulled her hand away it was like it was drenched in a thick oil substance.

"Ewwww. Dude, you didn't tell me how much of a mess you make when you're excited. Jeeze. Pass me a towel"
5924 2018-10-26 18:05:23 Is that Nesa Subramaniyan, one of my many great oil reporters, on your left?
5925 2018-10-26 18:05:19 Ohhhhh....well you could have shoved them in the middle.
Ok phew..

5927 2018-10-26 18:05:07 Why are people so heartless in this lagos, so this kilishi seller kept his glass box filled with kilishi outside d mosque premises to pray magrib , someone stole it before we finished prayer, some ppl said they saw someone carry it on okada 
5928 2018-10-26 18:04:54 Lo más justo es una fiscalidad más baja para todo los transportistas si quitan el módulo tanto para autónomos como para empresarios, ya que dichos impuestos nos cuentas los costes en bruto como gas oil, averías como limpio y combustible profesional ya además el cobro a 60 días
5929 2018-10-26 18:04:54 I just died watching him say, "Coconut oil and prayer!" Same here. Then calling out chai tea.

5934 2018-10-26 18:03:53 You need to be careful which oil execs you're talking about. This may seem incredible to you, but the Alberta oil sands CEOs are among the most forward thinging execs in Canada, supporting carbon pricing and acknowledging the threat of climate change.

5937 2018-10-26 18:03:26 Our goal is to provide scientific evidence that is relevant for Canada's oil spill preparedness, as it relates to microorganisms and bioremediation. This will help us know to what extent bioremediation should inform and be part of an overall strategy #cdnscichat 4/4
5938 2018-10-26 18:03:26 Yep. Who profits from that? The same people promoting the "man made global warming" narrative and telling us we need to be vegetarians and buy their "all natural" palm oil based soap

5942 2018-10-26 18:02:41 The rich folks in TX are the ones who became rich through oil. They are no different than Arabs in enjoying the fruits given by our Lord. In California they earn their wealth. They create and design some of the most innovative products on the planet Earth.

5946 2018-10-26 18:02:34 I have no SIDE... I hate politics because its peole with large egos selling snake oil with claims here and there. They can change their pov at any point and go off the path they told you first. I hate it I'm worried this man is with a group that can hurt people.
5947 2018-10-26 18:02:34 They need a better comms department. An oil company complaining about lobbying..what's next..Kanye and Trump are friends?...oh fuck us all.

5954 2018-10-26 18:01:41 it causes a lot, i get that. but the means of transport is the real issue. we depend on crude oil and coal powered electric generation too much
5955 2018-10-26 18:01:38 i wish someone would take my car to get the oil changed 
5956 2018-10-26 18:01:33 Yaseer ya kke
5957 2018-10-26 18:01:29 I realized I was adulting when I asked for an oil change as a 21st birthday gift from my boyfriend...
5958 2018-10-26 18:01:29 Sorry if I’m unclear. Koskinen is the 38th highest paid goalie in the league which means if we are getting value he should be expected to play about 35 games. 

8 games into the season with 0 games played means they aren’t getting the value out of him.
5959 2018-10-26 18:01:20 Rest assured he is not into cooking oil.there I said it!
5960 2018-10-26 18:01:18 trying to get my damn oil changed and I guess there’s SOOOO many things wrong with my car. about to cry :-)
5961 2018-10-26 18:01:11 And she then went to Joburg to buy cooking oil. I think she wants to be the next ZBC chief so she has started bootlicking.
5962 2018-10-26 18:01:08 Some of the items on the current voting ballot are sneaky, in that they are bundling things together. For example, one prohibits drilling for oil in certain areas, but loops in banning e-cigarettes and vapor-generating devices. In the same article. These things are not related!
5963 2018-10-26 18:01:04 I need to change my oil too and my clothes need to be washed I gotta make a list and check it twice for escape make more kandi fuckkkkkkk why do I procrastinate and when I come back I have test to slay fuck

5972 2018-10-26 18:00:05 turbo charged engine means changing the oil almost every month lmao

5978 2018-10-26 17:59:29 Hell yeah, it's the latest diet. All you do is drink olive oil an old white guy talked to. Sheds pounds in minutes.
5979 2018-10-26 17:59:16 I can’t wait to make my daughter whipped Shea butter infused with Apricot Oil, Olive Oil, and Vitamin E Oil. Stink butt got eczema.
5980 2018-10-26 17:59:08 The best gift president Trump can give to the Middle East is liberal democratic values like free press, human rights, democracy, etc. Oil, cheap oil should not postpone these values.
5981 2018-10-26 17:59:07 Venezuela collapsed because of US sanctions on a single-commodity-based (oil) economy. China is state capitalist. I don't play Xbox, I like PS4.

5984 2018-10-26 17:58:47 I hate changing my oil now that I stripped the bolt 
5985 2018-10-26 17:58:38 Fuck oil prices, let’s talk about these atm hustlers

5987 2018-10-26 17:58:14 Yeah, I saute' the mushrooms in extra virgin olive oil with some chopped fresh garlic and add a dash of salt...so yummy!
5988 2018-10-26 17:58:05 Devasting millions of acres if rain-forest for pasture maize and palm oil plantations to feed the ever growing population might be a factor?

5990 2018-10-26 17:57:58 No. That's not Henry's Superman. Zack went to great pains to make sure Superma  can't do stuff like that. Refer back to the oil rig, the space shuttle, etc. The housing unit was Whedon screwing over continuity for a joke.

5993 2018-10-26 17:57:36 Hahaha words can’t describe how much I dislike him...... it annoys me that someone can protest so much against the thing he clearly indulges in/sells himself 
I hate the amount of olive oil he puts in everything but I haven’t tried to get that banned

5996 2018-10-26 17:56:32 @jiffylube why does your oil, which you get in large supplies, cost more per quart than it costs in stores?
5997 2018-10-26 17:56:32 Keto, I like it.

I'm looking for full spectrum CBD oil in capsule or tincture form. Quality is a concern and I'd prefer a UK sourced product. I have to consider price too as I'm not a Royal. Any recommendations from your followers?
5998 2018-10-26 17:56:25 Lmk if u like it! I also realized that if u ice it the coconut oil starts to re-freeze so I would say it’s better hot!
5999 2018-10-26 17:56:23 try some face oil or an exfoliating face wash, that usually takes the stains out whenever something similar happens to me
6000 2018-10-26 17:56:20 Going to get my oil changed. If it wasn’t raining I would get it washed too but oh well.

6005 2018-10-26 17:56:07 Hahahaha. Yeah. I guess a booming economy, tax cuts, lowest unemployment ever, world's producer of oil, is a real threat. *eyeroll*
6006 2018-10-26 17:56:06 He studied Hitler. His first wife confirmed this. Therefore I believe that maniac wants to take over the world with Putin. They want to go after the oil under the ice caps
6007 2018-10-26 17:56:01 Hey @VinceMcMahon & @StephMcMahon, after Saudi Arabia how about going to Turkmenistan. They are oil rich, too. I’m sure @WWE can really help to bring “change” to that totalitarian hell hole.

6011 2018-10-26 17:55:31 What's the correlation between selling assets cheap to the politically connected, and the assets being pure rent plays (oil wells...) in the first place?
6012 2018-10-26 17:55:29 4 tbsp self raising flour, enough milk to cover that, 2tbsp olive oil, pinch of salt and honey. Microwave n got yourself a damn nice cake
6013 2018-10-26 17:55:23 Both use copious amounts of oil in their work!
6014 2018-10-26 17:55:20 Yeah but shaving soap or castile soap or just shaving oil (read; basically any edible oil) works fine too no need to go overboard with this "cream" stuff...
6015 2018-10-26 17:54:42 Kudos to the snake oil consultant who made an exorbitant fee convincing you it was a good idea to run this social media campaign to convince people destroying the environment is in their best interest
6016 2018-10-26 17:54:31 I asked them they said it’s beef oil
6017 2018-10-26 17:53:59 I was just about to ask that. Maybe they are used in tricky oil theft vessel situations

6019 2018-10-26 17:53:50 Is this using pre Brexit figures to calculate the cost or is it on the presumption that Scottish oil is going to fund a spending free for all?

6022 2018-10-26 17:53:24 We need sound leadership and good decision making. Prayer is not in the success equation. We have seen churches promoting laziness through fake miracles and annoiting water and oil. We need solar pumps like yesterday. No to pple who call God's name in vain

Things that are fundamentally wrong with my car.
6027 2018-10-26 17:53:00 I think it depends on the marinade (if any)-the top caramelises and is really tasty-if you don’t cook it all the way through it’s still got the freshness of lettuce. If you like fresh lettuce, just charring the top with some olive oil/seasoning would be really tasty.

6030 2018-10-26 17:52:57 Oil spill is a serious health and safety breach, not only to nature bt also to humans. Govt should formulate some policies and strengthen existing laws to curb the prevailing patterns at industrial zones, sp. the shipyards n #Karachi.
Lets make our coasts cleaner + env.friendly
6031 2018-10-26 17:52:51 Lol I read this as "MTC" oil and thought you were chugging the oil they use in the LDS church for blessings.  I was REALLY confused
6032 2018-10-26 17:52:51 WTI oil $66.57/barrel, -$0.75.
6033 2018-10-26 17:52:50 Today, for the first time ever, I used words like "sweet" & "sour" in dialogue surrounding crude oil. It amazes me how much information there is in this world to learn. Personal growth is an infinite opportunity.

6034 2018-10-26 17:52:47 Yet they agreed to have Russia build a pipeline to Germany so they will dependant on their evil oil. Not selling to SA is just a tip of the hat to Iran
6035 2018-10-26 17:52:44 Just make yourself some proper Cannabis oil. It's not that hard.
6036 2018-10-26 17:52:38 I’ve cooked gnocchi like this a few times, with a teaspoon of oil before the water.
6037 2018-10-26 17:52:34 Thanks for reminding me I need to get my oil changed today. 
6038 2018-10-26 17:52:32 Who thinks acres of solar panels or miles of windmill farms are environmentally better than an oil well? Or an underground coal mine?
6039 2018-10-26 17:52:30 Why so much olive oil?
6040 2018-10-26 17:52:24 Look, I’m also a “climate change denier”. What I’m going on about is that (if) some atmospheric imbalances were caused by billions of cars on roads every day. Oil companies must be pay “climate tax” not the public and efficient systems must be allowed
6041 2018-10-26 17:52:23 If someone brings my car for an oil change I’ll give them $10 pls
6042 2018-10-26 17:52:07 Fun Fact:  Much of the original funding for the DLC came from companies like ARCO, Chevron, Merck, DuPont, Microsoft, Phillip Morris & Koch Industries.  They were funded by big oil, big pharma, tobacco, & tech, so  they were basically corporate-owned & Bill Clinton was the Chair.
6043 2018-10-26 17:52:06 Go to see my Grandma. She has been in chronic pain for years. Whips a bottle of CBD oil and makes a drink with it, and offers me some. I love my grandma.
6044 2018-10-26 17:52:05 They got everything wrong,Oil decreased a bit,Maybe petrol will decrease by 80c
6045 2018-10-26 17:51:58 But the point the economist is making is that the trend was parallel to Colombia's.  As Colombia's oil exports fell off so did Venezuela prior to Aug 2017.   The indpendent varialbe is the sanctions and you can see the divergance between the two once the sactions are imposed.
6046 2018-10-26 17:51:53 Zimbabwe hayii aah, No fuel, No cooking oil, No jobs, No money,  Nobuhle, Nompilo, Nothando, Nontokozo, Nonhlanhla, Nokuthula, Nomthandazo

6048 2018-10-26 17:51:43 Maybe the positive way to look at it is if this whole writing thing doesn't work out you can have a second career as an oil guy?
6049 2018-10-26 17:51:40 56 years young, but when you see me, I look 30 years old due to the coconut oil, and healthy eating.

6051 2018-10-26 17:51:30 we also wonder how quickly biodegradation can occur in very cold water of the Arctic Ocean. Seawater is still liquid at -2C. If there's a spill under those conditions, how does the oil behave, and how quickly will the microbes respond? #cdnscichat 5/n
6052 2018-10-26 17:51:26 So much liberal salt being spilt over Trump speaking to #YBLS2018, they know they are losing their hold over minorities

No one is buying your snake oil anymore, people see what damage liberal policies have done to black neighbourhoods and black families, they have had enough
6053 2018-10-26 17:51:16 เขาใหญ่เด้ออ
6054 2018-10-26 17:51:06 I promised something... 

1 onion chopped 
1 clove of garlic chopped
2 tbs ground ginger
Chili
Roast in vegetable oil,
then add
125 g peanut cream
2 tbs tomato puree
3 tomatoes
Salt
Bay leaf
Simmer for 45 min

We did it like that which was not strictly following the recipe
6055 2018-10-26 17:51:01 terrible. you forgot to blame Obummer for changing the oil every 5000 miles and checking tire pressure like he asked for in the 2008 campaign.
6056 2018-10-26 17:51:01 It shouldn’t take 4 hours to change oil and put on 2 tires...
6057 2018-10-26 17:50:57 cannot believe my mums giving my dog cbd oil to calm him with the fire works 
6058 2018-10-26 17:50:43 it’s an extension of the fact we run into in prospect land a lot: there are very few people on the public side any good at all at evaluating hitting, and a lot of snake oil going around

6060 2018-10-26 17:50:37 *goes to grab my oil*
6061 2018-10-26 17:50:37 Another great trick is to put a little drop of baby oil in your dip brow when it gets too dry.
6062 2018-10-26 17:50:33 “They’ll wait 2 minutes before charges begin for their time” so no time to buy more oil for your lamp.
6063 2018-10-26 17:50:12 Pay them with raw oil, the price is usually lower that way
6064 2018-10-26 17:50:05 Changed my oil and wiper blades. Am I an adult yet?
6065 2018-10-26 17:49:58 Exactly. I hate sleeping with dirty hair. Dry hair people have the luxury of not producing oil in there. They don’t get it .
6066 2018-10-26 17:49:57 Washing diyas,drying them,then putting ghee-oil-bati.Then sisters used to decorate gharaundas.Sweets used to be prepared in house. It was complete family affair.Then Colony celebration. All these have gone. Now series bulbs,boxed sweets,chocolates & Happy diwali
6067 2018-10-26 17:49:50 Need my oil changed and room cleaned. Help with that, I have the ice cream cake covered

6075 2018-10-26 17:48:51 OIL OIL OIL . と紙に書くとサザエさんに聞こえる。
6076 2018-10-26 17:48:45 Weird, barrel of oil price dropped $12 in less than two weeks recently.
6077 2018-10-26 17:48:42 I think that needs a very careful look, in terms of both carbon reduction and economics.  Oil patch workers could be given priority in retraining for work in the sustainable energy sector.  While it's still needed more oil could be diverted for domestic use, extending drawdown.
6078 2018-10-26 17:48:40 Would there be a different effect  with fat coming from bacon vs. olive oil? Or high fat is high fat and that’s it?
6079 2018-10-26 17:48:38 Carbon taxes just a token -too low, exempt major polluters.  $billions in subsidies to oil companies.  Corporate tax reductions mean Canada will not get enuf revenue to cover subsidies & reclamation (as companies fold up & leave).  Need $$ to adapt. Can move faster to renewables
6080 2018-10-26 17:48:28 when you lay down, lay on your left side so your digestive organs are properly aligned :)

6082 2018-10-26 17:48:10 Speaking engagements. Book deals. War chests full to the brim with corrupt money from corrupt lobbies and corporations seeking to drive political gain for themselves by holding lifelong politicians in their pockets. Guaranteed votes for big oil, Wall Street, drug companies, banks
6083 2018-10-26 17:48:01 Doing an oil change to the truck i do everything to a truck that aint even mines and since i do everything to this beauty imma go outta town next month for the weekend plans are plans  And then NY here i come for christmas Travel time 
6084 2018-10-26 17:47:55 @realDonaldTrump seems intent on bringing the country to the brink of CIVIL WAR, while allowing our environment to be decimated by big oil.  What the fuck is up with that??  What kind of president does this????
6085 2018-10-26 17:47:52 Gotta get my oil changed and clean my car bruh
6086 2018-10-26 17:47:45 Life is sacred regardless of the worthiness of the person. Killing is only acceptable in self defense. Wanting to cut taxes, invade countries for oil, or taking revenge on criminals are not valid reasons to kill anymore than a baby being a challenge is an excuse fir abortion.
6087 2018-10-26 17:47:37 just change my oil, stop calling me “dear” and commenting on how my name sounds like a bottle of rum. thx bro.
6088 2018-10-26 17:47:17 where is #prd ??
6089 2018-10-26 17:47:11 พี่แป๋มมมม ไปไหนๆๆๆ
6090 2018-10-26 17:47:11 Probably because the tree huggers are creative, thinking types and oil execs are I can yell loudest therefore I am right types
6091 2018-10-26 17:47:08 the pharmacy lot on the news saying cbd oil has no mental benefits do my nut in. say that to those lil kids w epilepsy that have a whole new life from it. they’re just shitting their pants for their jobs because the cbd works better than their piss poor anti anxieties.

6095 2018-10-26 17:46:48 There are so many ways to enjoy this organic, high vibrational olive oil. It just goes to show-you don't have to sacrifice great health to indulge in amazing flavor! #Vervana #VervanaMarket #EVOO #ExtraVirginOliveOil #Organic #Wellness #MindfulEating
6096 2018-10-26 17:46:46 Read the initiative people!!! READ IT. IT IS FEE BASED. ITS NOT A TAX! BIG OIL DOESN'T WANT TO CLEAN UP AFTER THEMSELVES AND AVOID THOSE FEES. THEY'D RATHER CAUSE THE POLLUTION AND PASS ON THE FEES TO YOU BY RAISING THEIR RATES. READ THE TRUTH AND STOP BELIEVING THEIR LIES!
6097 2018-10-26 17:46:21 Itu bagus, bikin muka gak kering terus bikin gak jerawatan. Fyi, aku oil skin
6098 2018-10-26 17:46:10 As Shell sold it to me when I was in Shell Eco Marathon. The oil is running out, so they need us to use less oil so it lasts longer and can be sold at a higher price.
But if you are in to electric, ask where the nickel, Cobalt and rare earth minerals comes from.
6099 2018-10-26 17:46:00 Yup! Either grazing land or oil. The money trail never lies!
6100 2018-10-26 17:45:50 Iran can only sale cheaper oil to india and shelters to Indian agents on border area just like afghans do
6101 2018-10-26 17:45:43 I'll be there...well not literally..alarm set early...shopping..then coffee and a croissant....please can you introduce them as I never have a clue which is which. I just guess which voice fits the face 
6102 2018-10-26 17:45:38 what does this do omg I have tea tree oil and I almost never use it anymore
6103 2018-10-26 17:45:35 My Organic Vervana Koroneiki #EVOO is accented by notes of fresh grass and green banana, this oil finishes in the throat with a pungent peppery bite and packs a distinct, delectable flavor you won't soon forget! #VervanaMarket #ExtraVirginOliveOil #Organic #Wellness
6104 2018-10-26 17:45:22 If it’s your last night, just go to the Founders Arms. Get a pint of Neck Oil and if you’re brave, sit outside under a heater and look at the river.
6105 2018-10-26 17:45:16 You do know that a lot of things that run on oil can run on gas? You can also run gas fired power stations, cars, heating systems, the lot. It would reduce out need for oil.

6109 2018-10-26 17:44:30 Got an oil change, jeep fixed and almost done packing for drill. This is the most productive I’ve been all week.
6110 2018-10-26 17:44:25 Its due to oil spill cleaning
6111 2018-10-26 17:44:23 A lot was learned about oil-degrading bacteria in the aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico #cdnscichat 1/n

Free to the first person who claims them. DM me if interested.
6116 2018-10-26 17:43:14 @realDonaldTrump Oil and banking sanctions are not exempted, and Swift must stop supplying it to Iran. November 4th The storm of sanctions will undermine Iran's regime's economy

6118 2018-10-26 17:43:07 I need advice for #vegan #skincare
My jawline has a rough texture and little blackheads and the rest if my face is dry/flakey. I've been using which hazel, micellar water and jojoba oil. Which has helped up until recently.
6119 2018-10-26 17:43:06 Oh my god I’ve heard the Castro oil , but never tried I just might this time . 
6120 2018-10-26 17:42:50 They're getting less common, judging by the number of service companies who are like, "Oh, sorry, our oil guy retired"
6121 2018-10-26 17:42:46 @realDonaldTrump The Iranian regime is the biggest supporter of terrorism, and the exemption for this regime has no meaning. On November 4th, China, India, or any country from Iran will buy oil from the United States with the most severe sanctions and will go to the US markets

6123 2018-10-26 17:42:40 Job and the economy have nothing to do with politics, want to make a point, stop buying Billions in oil from the Saudi’s you idiot! Get our oil off of the ground and keep those Billions in Canada!
6124 2018-10-26 17:42:36 First and most important rule in making Jollof, the oil should be gauged properly, if not the very minute after adding your parboiled rice, it starts burning. Thank You.
6125 2018-10-26 17:42:34 usually hurt little over a year maybe more considering ur spine was tapped take a warm bath ask someone to get bit of oil lay on flat surface with both thumbs have them apply pressure simultaneously on each side of the lower spine up & down motions releasing tension & fluidity
6126 2018-10-26 17:42:34 Stop being naive bro. The Paris Debt was cleared and another PDP president got us back in debt by squandering all that obasanjo saved for us. Was it Buhari? We were in debt when PMB came we had gone back into debt, oil price was at its lowest, no savings, nothing to fall back on.
6127 2018-10-26 17:42:31 My dad changed my oil, cleaned my car, and got me new tires. I love him so much :(
6128 2018-10-26 17:42:11 Haha, yesss. Coconut oil is the best! I use it, too. 
6129 2018-10-26 17:42:10 了解です～
6130 2018-10-26 17:42:06 2d half of J. Schlesinger's theory:
When oil price ↓, cost of inventory is no longer justified. SPR sells, that puts additional ↓ pressure on oil prices.
Initially, SPR was viewed as a great idea (embargo days..) until Schlesinger detailed the costs of oil storage...
6131 2018-10-26 17:42:05 Like oil and water!
6132 2018-10-26 17:42:01 I like em smashed more than mashed- sort of just based about a bit with parsley, salt pepper and oil- so don’t use a masher
6133 2018-10-26 17:41:52 Good argument. Bring in Saudi oil instead of using ours. Provide govt jobs paid for with debt. Transform high paying oil jobs with crappy part time jobs. Then provide services that must be cut in the future because we won’t have the money to service them.
6134 2018-10-26 17:41:52 didn’t know a basic oil change could take 3 hours
6135 2018-10-26 17:41:47 Smells like baby oil and booty flakes
6136 2018-10-26 17:41:34 time to whip up a batch of some manuka honey + argan oil body butter.
6137 2018-10-26 17:41:27 I hate coming to get an oil change by myself. This is a man’s job because they always try to get you to pay for something extra lol.
6138 2018-10-26 17:41:24 Me: Ma hilutin mo ako (mangiyakngiyak)
Mama: kuha ka oil
Me: wait po nasa kwarto ko
Mama: saan ba?
Me: buong paa po ma
Mama: hindi ka kasi umiinom ng gatas
Me: wala naman tayong gatas eh
Mama: bibili ako bukas ganyan din ako nung bata kulang ka sa gatas
6139 2018-10-26 17:41:22 Olive oil dala hai na.
6140 2018-10-26 17:41:15 I use coconut oil with a little bit of wax for my hair product. You don’t know how happy this made me!!
6141 2018-10-26 17:41:12 I literally get burned from oil popping or the hot stove from making dinner every night & don’t even realize it til the next day. Smh
6142 2018-10-26 17:41:10 Was it exuberance putting alot of oil in
6143 2018-10-26 17:40:59 Money managers have cut their bullish ICE Brent crude oil bets by 48,333 net-long positions to 360,785, weekly ICE Futures Europe data on futures and options show. The net-long position was the least bullish in two months

6144 2018-10-26 17:40:59 Pour hot oil on their private part, slice it into pieces and force them to eat it at gun point, then send them to 2 life terms (when they die, they will still be chained up in the coffin
6145 2018-10-26 17:40:58 No, I think it was Bush who didn't go aftr the Saudis aftr 911. Bush didn't put trillions on the bks. He caused the worst recession, he occupied/invaded a sovereign nation &killed its leader, made our finest fight&die in a war 4 oil. He also was eating cake while Katrina drowned+

6151 2018-10-26 17:40:25 Part of the plan. Liberal ties to George Soros, Tom Steyer, Tides Foundation & illegal funding in our elections well known. Libs helped them kill our pipeline projects to continue oil by rail.
Needless to say they make out like bandits, as they own most of tanker cars in NA

6152 2018-10-26 17:40:21 So for 500 followers I was going to give away an oil show, but now I think I'm going to give away a bj/fucking myself video instead

6156 2018-10-26 17:40:10 Because of the oil spill last night.

6158 2018-10-26 17:39:48 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
6159 2018-10-26 17:39:44 The cost to fill up my gas tank today was as much as I was gonna pay for CBD oil last night 
6160 2018-10-26 17:39:39 Which brand of Tea Tree Oil
6161 2018-10-26 17:39:35 Ah crap. Have they tried Olbas Oil on used teabags to keep the cat away? Lavender plants can also work well.
6162 2018-10-26 17:39:21 lbeyeofnewh I HAVE MY OUTFIT PLANNED IF THE WEATHER COORDINATES shfueoebsu but I need to look for backup. OMG FUN WHAT COLOR IS YOUR HAIR?!? (I’m sure you’ve tried a ton of stuff) but whenever I bleach and dye my hair fancy colors I always put this flower oil mask thing
6163 2018-10-26 17:39:21 If we challenged our academic chemists to develop safer fracking chemistry there is no reason why the fracking industry and the revenues from it couldn’t be held in public ownership. We can only envy Norway’s sovereign wealth fund derived largely from oil exploration.

6165 2018-10-26 17:39:03 I wish i knew how to do oil changes
6166 2018-10-26 17:39:00 For it is George W. Bush's decision to reopen the Alaskan Arctic to Big Oil/Gas exploration despite the well- known risks that Trump can" hide" behind after giving them unregulated access to the entire region.

6168 2018-10-26 17:38:53 I don't like Megyn Kelly, but she flat out got screwed by NBC.  Hopefully she can sue the hell out of this Fake News Organization.  @nbc Moving on to GMA and ABC, but not thrilled with overpaid, little jack ass @GStephanopoulos.
6169 2018-10-26 17:38:43 One down!! I'm glad they managed to do the oil change and that your brakes are safe! 
6170 2018-10-26 17:38:24 Madam oil will again hit 80 in nov
6171 2018-10-26 17:38:21 I’ve had so many arguements with chefs and waiters and I’m not being picky. Simply steaming & boiling foods with no oil or butter, it always seems to be an issue and I always end up being unwell.
6172 2018-10-26 17:38:20 People have forgotten. Corporations wanted oil, so we all got pollution and global warming and sick. Corporations wanted food adulteration and genetic altering, so we all got fat and sick. Corporations wanted a pill for every person, so we're all being "diagnosed" and made sick.
6173 2018-10-26 17:38:10 Nope...because other nations dare not impose punishment...why...because it will see oil price go up to new level and own nations citizens will revolt...it's not new...happened before in 70s
6174 2018-10-26 17:38:03 Transportation is not and never was the problem. Oil companies FORCED society away from the natural progress of clean and efficient systems into their foul, destructive, grossly inefficient systems for their exclusive benefit.
6175 2018-10-26 17:38:02 Nigeria with all its oil wealth
6176 2018-10-26 17:38:02 While inventories are risings, oil prices will rise too."Remember when James Schlesinger pointed that out (Carter days) ref. SPR and how it could drive oil prices ↑ or ↓ at the 'wrong' time.
When oil price heads ↑, SPR buys. Result: demand ↑ drives price ↑ faster.
6177 2018-10-26 17:37:59 Fellas! We Like Nudes Too  So Oil That Lil Mf Up & Have aPhoto Shoot 
6178 2018-10-26 17:37:55 We see this crap in Canada too - esp. western Canada - thank God for strong activists. But oil money is at least shared with aboriginals - now if we can only do something about the reserves. But that is a whole other story and I'm sure someone else can tell the story.
6179 2018-10-26 17:37:55 Cutting back on oil is a good thing. 
Stop cutting down the rain forest, I was taught it was nature lungs. 
Stop dumping Chems into the ocean. 
Lots of real solutions. 

A tax isn’t one of them.
6180 2018-10-26 17:37:50 What's next, ama olive oil? Chuna maybe? Aek 
6181 2018-10-26 17:37:38 Hope they prepared to give me a free oil change
6182 2018-10-26 17:37:37 This happened for real?
He wasn't of Irish origin we believe.

So much dirt and loathing has been cast against the Irish that it triggers the question: what the earth underneath Irish feet holds, that all this becomes necessary?

Oil? Gold?.. anything not yet part of exploration?

6188 2018-10-26 17:37:07 Los paises que tienen menos de 10 años de reservas de oil and gas (según informe BP) tienen estrategias creíbles para generar beneficios económicos creíbles considerando otras fuentes. Pretender amarrar al país con un mono ingreso de nuevo es un error grande.

6193 2018-10-26 17:36:14 So I'm sitting here at the mechanics getting my oil change... 

In my head, i was thinking about how hungry I am.

6197 2018-10-26 17:35:22 You know you’ve got an addiction when the woman behind the pizza counter at @asda knows exactly what you get on it, right down to the oil on top .!  #AsdaPizza #Addiction
6198 2018-10-26 17:35:13 Same my dad would make up take the tire off the trailer just to put them back on and had us set alarms on our phone every week to check oil and coolant. I also know how to change the oil in my car  thanks dad
6199 2018-10-26 17:34:55 honestly of all the expensive all natural crazy face washes I’ve tried, the $3 Grapefruit cleanser from Brandless has been the BEST I’ve ever had! Wash with that, moisturize w rose hip oil, and my skin got SOOOO much nicer!
6200 2018-10-26 17:34:54 How credible is the news currently circulating about Oil Licenses that wouldn’t be renewed @Nairametrics
6201 2018-10-26 17:34:53 btw for oil cleansing im still using heimish all clean balm which is working perfectly haha i think generally koreans do oil cleansing products better

so now  i smell like a candy cane because i slathered myself in peppermint oil. 
i embody a christian mother
6203 2018-10-26 17:34:52 Sadly, the thinking has never changed. The actions, noise, and obliviousness fueled by it have only increased. 
Please stop adding oil to this fire. You are better than this, at least you used to be.

6205 2018-10-26 17:34:41 Even if we are able to replace oil as a fuel source it's still the key component of all of our technology. It is in fact this reason I feel 100 years from now people will think we were idiots for using such a valuable resource so foolishly as to propel vehicles.
6206 2018-10-26 17:34:38 No escucho quejas de la subida del gas oíl en los últimos meses, ya casi al precio de l gasolina. Claro que esta, es por parte de las petroleras que son buenos patrocinadores.....
6207 2018-10-26 17:34:37 So the analyst believes $GM is going to wake up in Q4 producing profitable EVs amid declining sales and revenue with oil prices rising. Sounds ridiculous.

6211 2018-10-26 17:34:07 Oil companies are playing voters for suckers convincing you "welfare queens" and corrupt government are misallocating money, while they spend several million each year to pay little to no taxes and contribute to the infrastructure they use.

6216 2018-10-26 17:33:01 @SecretaryPerry looks like he is seeing evolution and science everywhere... Was he expecting finding oil in his job?
6217 2018-10-26 17:32:59 Some people are pretending they care about human rights and want to tie oil deals to ethical behaviour by governments. We know it's all about maximizing profits for private companies.
6218 2018-10-26 17:32:58 Giant tax giveaways to oil companies under the threat of them "going elsewhere" if we charge them any amount in taxes while ruining roads and bridges daily transporting that stuff and trying their damndest not to pay when they ruin the coastline.

Low tire pressure already? Might need to change my front-right tire bc the last time I had my air refilled the maintenance guy said it had a puncture...

Also due for an oil change.

Cars are such a necessary evil, I wish electric ones were the fucking standard.
6234 2018-10-26 17:31:08 As long as you don't cover yourself in oil and take pictures of yourself in your knickers, you're good. Oh and don't send bombs to people. That too.

6247 2018-10-26 17:29:29 Don White and other Canadians helped The Netherlands to get freedom again. Now The Netherlands give away that precious freedom to the EU and they sell this freedom for the price of oil.

6250 2018-10-26 17:29:03 We weren't. It was worse than that. It was bush's keynsian idea of boosting the economy through war spending. They didn't even take the oil. It was madness
6251 2018-10-26 17:28:46 The country is effectively bankrupt. Every family is £350,000  in debt to the Govt. Where does the Govt plan to get this money from? Corbin will take your house and bank account. This is happening in the country with the largest deposits of oil in the world...Venezuela.
6252 2018-10-26 17:28:41 How do I even own a car? Like I read a post that your suppose to check oil levels and shit? Like I don’t even know how to open the bonnet like alone check everything

6260 2018-10-26 17:27:43 Yesterday, a group went outside and worked with leaf blowers. Before being able to use leaf blowers mr. Kurtz showed us how to fill up the gas/oil mix for the blowers along with the proper safety required.

6263 2018-10-26 17:27:26 I really hope this castor oil works for my baby hair 
6264 2018-10-26 17:26:52 Charlie, #DonaldTrump has never drilled for oil (or worked a honest day's work) in his life. Have you seen his girly hands?

Meanwhile, US taxpayers continue to pay $20B per year in #corporatewelfare to #fossilfuels companies. I thought you hated welfare?
6265 2018-10-26 17:26:48  U didn’t see Innoson or Forte oil abi

6271 2018-10-26 17:26:10 Ok, what do you think is cleaner? Wind? Nope, takes more raw materials and oil to produce a wind mill than said mill will generate over its life span. Solar? Nope, panels are made from largely petroleum products and require batteries that are very bad for the environment.
6272 2018-10-26 17:25:56 I need to go get an oil change 
6273 2018-10-26 17:25:34 Not in Jos tho
6274 2018-10-26 17:25:23 I’ve been hearing and understanding since the late 60s. I’m tired of it, tbqh. It’s decades past time for these ignorant people to go back to school and take some civics and economics. They keep voting for Republican snake oil and the rich get richer. Over and over again.

6277 2018-10-26 17:25:02 How could you be so dumb, living this low standard of life and be happy. No constant electricity. No good roads. Nothing working, and afraid to ask the Party in govt, 16yrs of past 19yrs, what happened to all the money realized from sales of free God given oil. Don't be a dumb.

6298 2018-10-26 17:21:33 MbS's attitude seems to be: "This is nothing that a little oil money can't fix." 

That's probably been correct up until now. Hopefully, this time is different.

6300 2018-10-26 17:21:26 I always use my best acting skills when the oil change guy shows me the stick thing and I pretend like I have any idea what the hell I'm looking at.
6301 2018-10-26 17:21:21 Pretty much. 

Let's see. Venuzula was a corrupt shithole, with a single commodity economy that collapsed with the oil market. Cuba has been under a major embargo and actually isn't has bad economically as people make it out to be. 

Why can't we be compared to Scandinavia?

6326 2018-10-26 17:18:11 alaska needs to focus on growing alternative sources of income to prepare for when our planet collectively realizes that climate change is happening and that oil is causing great harm! and trust me, tourism is growing FAST
6327 2018-10-26 17:18:09 2018 coconut oil lol
6328 2018-10-26 17:18:02 Funny that I'm a troll for questioning you, who selectively (and incorrectly) quotes scientific papers and actual scientists. The only reason you and other cons try to twist the language is so you can continue denying climate change to further suck up to the oil industry. #bigcon
6329 2018-10-26 17:17:57 Yes - it’s quite commonly spoken about in vegan groups. Particularly issues like palm oil and migrant bees. There’s a growth in veganic farming, and permaculture is spreading too.

6331 2018-10-26 17:17:26 Finally got some tee tree oil
6332 2018-10-26 17:17:22 I agree that the government made major missteps in managing the economy but the sanctions now make it impossible to get out of this situation. That dropoff in oil exports because of the sanctions is a $6 bln hit.  That would finance the entire healthcare system in Venezuela.
6333 2018-10-26 17:17:06 Oil isn't going anywhere. It is the main ingredient in almost every aspect of our society. That computer or cell phone you are using right now? You guessed it - oil. Oil is still the safest, most economical engery source we have.

6336 2018-10-26 17:16:40 If the yuan depreciates 20% all the oil and coal and iron they import becomes 20% more expensive for Chinese, as well as everything else they import.  CPC will defend the CFETS peg from anything abrupt. Remember, Tiananmen1989 began as an inflation protest.
6337 2018-10-26 17:16:38 Dude.. relax.  I’d didn’t say anything— You  are so knee jerk.  U defend everyone and everything including an environmental disaster of an oil spill the other day—that was when I knew u won’t hear reason. Just relax.  Grab a  will ya’.. I’m worried about u

6341 2018-10-26 17:16:02 And kids get nosebleeds and asthma from the generous oil companies as well. And when those kids read the lorax they'll realize nobody including the oil companies give a fuck about crummies in their tummies... or is the lorax just leftest propaganda?

6382 2018-10-26 17:11:58 If you put any bible in a bucket of oil it will drip oil for awhile.     So why is there no video of it actually filling up a container with oil???

6400 2018-10-26 17:10:41 Okay
6401 2018-10-26 17:10:29 But does it actually make oil??? Why are there no videos of it just sitting in a container so we as viewers can see it fill up.    Instead of taking some peoples word who we know nothing about
6402 2018-10-26 17:10:21 シエル君撫でたら睨まれちったよ(；｀ω´)
6403 2018-10-26 17:10:11 Or better yet would you accept being forced to live in a city with oil wells and will you be ok with having your family drink polluted water or breathe in polluted air.
6404 2018-10-26 17:10:08 I think they call those "husbands" and they do stuff like change the oil (not a euphemism for sex), fix the faucet, and build bookshelves for all the Anne Rice and Ursula K. Le Guin novels you just won't take to Half Price Books.

6413 2018-10-26 17:09:30 After Saudia, UAE will construct oil refinery in Pakistan.
World respect u when leader is not CORRUPT.
6414 2018-10-26 17:09:27 Yeah, the Kookanee groper is a feminist after all. Let's throw all those people out of work but keep buying Saudi oil.
6415 2018-10-26 17:09:25 The plant will emit between 1.8 and 2.2 million tonnes of greenhouse gases a year. This will be the largest emitter of in Quebec, according to Canada’s environment ministry, and will dwarf the yearly emissions of Shell Canada’s oil sands operations in Fort MacMurray Alta.
6416 2018-10-26 17:09:22 Parties will always bitch and complain and spin, thats our democracy, but the real judge is the electorate. How would the Canadian people react to us increasing the debt to buy these Lavs for our forces and get off Saudi oil. I personally think the reaction would be positive.

6423 2018-10-26 17:08:37 Great, off-shore oil drilling is likely unfeasible on the Oregon Coast. A real threat the fossil fuel industry is bringing to Oregon is fracked gas exports. How will you stand up with southern Oregonians to #stopJordanCove?
6424 2018-10-26 17:08:36 Getting splattered in the face with hot oil was definitely not on my list of things to do today. #WorkHazzard #DeliLife
6425 2018-10-26 17:08:34 Oh so the oil companies dont want to drill for oil on oregons coast. Why didnt you say so earlier? Now all oreGonians can relax about polluted water. Gosh we should just ask companies if they want to pollute the environment. No need for laws or regulations.
6426 2018-10-26 17:08:33 Oil and gas industry specializes in "alternative facts." Hey, if it works for the White House. . .
6427 2018-10-26 17:08:26 Here's a conspiracy theory for you.  All the oil leaks in the gulf coast have affected people down there. 
I don't believe that one bit fwiw.
6428 2018-10-26 17:08:22 I am literally the worst when it comes to having to get an oil change, I don’t remember until I’m 2000 kilometres over and I’m wondering why my car is making funny noises.
6429 2018-10-26 17:08:17 Thank you for your contributions to health care. Recently, I had to make two decisions: 1). To delay taking HDL Meds because of known side effects. 1). Instead, using Omega3 Fish Oil and Red Yeast Rice. Blood test in three months to see if it’s working. Then I’ll let Doc. know.

6442 2018-10-26 17:06:46 The new punitive sanctions on Iranian oil is a cause of why Trump is hesitant to comment on the actions of the Saudis, Oil barrel prices are increasing and having two enemies in the region could spell an oil crisis in the US
6443 2018-10-26 17:06:45 Saudi package is not a loan, it's rather smart financial planning by PMIK.

6452 2018-10-26 17:06:04 Inflation is bubbling up. Oil and gas prices are getting back to their 2009/10 highs. Food prices are sharply up. New home starts are way down, and housing prices in almost every market are now flat or declining.
6453 2018-10-26 17:05:56 And they try to sell you on all these “additional services” like umm no just change my oil so I can leave

6456 2018-10-26 17:05:48 Typical leftist.  I call you delusional you call abuse.  You said we have terrible oil and it’s not discounted but yet I provide evidence to the contrary and I am still wrong means you are delusional.  Look up the term.  I only speak of facts.

6475 2018-10-26 17:04:13 Even the judge who sent those 3 protestors to jail (who were then released) has links to oil and gas firms.
6476 2018-10-26 17:04:05 That's a previous mug shot...the guy has a long record. And not just for buying massage oil and Muscle Milk.
6477 2018-10-26 17:04:00 Just received a shipment of green gorilla CBD oil, including sublingual sprays and topical balms.
6478 2018-10-26 17:03:54 I told this girl happy birthday and she dead ass stared at me expressionless. I think I’d be the same if I was getting an oil change on my birthday.
6479 2018-10-26 17:03:50 Yall should be in the penzoil used motor oil bowl
6480 2018-10-26 17:03:50 Fais un essai avec 3 ou 4 litres avant d'en mettre plus , et avant mélange un demi litre d'huile et de gas oil dans un bidon pour voir la réaction du mélange. Tu a quoi comme moteur ?

6483 2018-10-26 17:03:36 The only thing that really changed now is the devastation of forests over the last 200 years with the “industrial revolution”. Reforestation is now imperative. Oil corporations must finance this with the Trillions they extorted from the "natural resource"
6484 2018-10-26 17:03:28 Itu ada tulisannya neng, dressing, bukan cooking oil
6485 2018-10-26 17:03:26 Set to become number one? You can't be serious. The oil industry provides 85% of our economy. EIGHTY-FIVE. That means all of the others combine for a mere 15% none of these are ever going to replace or more importantly sustain us.
6486 2018-10-26 17:03:24 Didn't you spend Veterans Day in Russia?  Oil and arms and destroying America...isn't that your agenda?  So tell me more how you're going to fix this because I'm very interested.

6493 2018-10-26 17:02:13 Come on Andy Pandy, who's really behind you? Big oil I expect wanting to pollute without cost and sell more of their toxic product. How short sighted you are
6494 2018-10-26 17:02:11 @seanhannity Liberal media & Dems will have a hayday with this; Sayoc was not trying to hide, out there in the open, magnet propaganda as if hes a Trump supporter what a joke, known terrorist & republican supporter is like oil & water.All orchestrated by the left to frame & blame

6517 2018-10-26 17:00:03 The problem with Global Capitalism is you eventually run out of people to exploit, to keep the greed train running ,you have to start wars or better still control despots in oil rich countries.
6518 2018-10-26 16:59:17 Cocoa butter and jojoba oil are my favs 
6519 2018-10-26 16:59:13 One possibility is that they were using peanut oil as a catalyst on some vaccines peanut oil was never meant to be injected directly into our bloodstream
6520 2018-10-26 16:59:04 Tater tots cooked right are awesome. Key is spray them with olive oil spray before putting in oven, gives them that crisp

6525 2018-10-26 16:57:47 What era is the MAGA referring to? Is it the 2000’s with Bush and his war for oil? The 90’s with President Clinton from 1992-2000? The 80’s with Reagan and his trickle down bullshit and war on drugs and irresponsible coverage of AIDS epidemic. Or the 70’s with Nixon and Carter?
6526 2018-10-26 16:57:37 A statistic I just came across: In 2017 in the UK, energy equivalent to 70,000 tonnes of oil was used by TVs on standby.

6530 2018-10-26 16:57:03 Because you are a gutless Trump Sycophant.  This government, and the past 7 administrations, has been giving the House of Saud a free pass because of oil dependence.  The Saudi government is the most evil and repressive regime in the world yet we bend over backwards for them.
6531 2018-10-26 16:56:42 The other underlying hidden fact. What are they in Yemen? It’s simple, there is a ton of oil there. Disgusting.

6544 2018-10-26 16:54:45 The reason they didn't work - the lady put way too much oil on
6545 2018-10-26 16:54:28 Arrived here in 1984......I think it was a lot worse back then. Only one industry and it had just tanked. Did the PC’s fix anything? Try to make the province more diverse employment- wise? Prepare for the future of oil and gas? No, not much. 2008....not enough had changed.
6546 2018-10-26 16:54:28 New car maintenance schedules are crazy. My truck only needs oil change every 15k miles and no real service of any sort until 45k. Not bad for a 1ton truck ;)
6547 2018-10-26 16:53:45 Dude... we turned away a caravan of Jewish people back in WW2, and now they’re all dead. These people can’t wait for Visas. The richest country on earth can afford to help them, we just prioritize oil wars instead of human lives.
6548 2018-10-26 16:53:41 It is an acquired taste, but olive (or any oil, like you said) will work too!!!
6549 2018-10-26 16:53:40 Sir you had said this पैसे paid पर नहीं ugate..

6551 2018-10-26 16:53:00 Democracy means the will of the people--not the will of the NRA or Big Oil money.

Who’s in?
6552 2018-10-26 16:52:59 I need some Money oil

6556 2018-10-26 16:52:41 Shout out to the service writer for the free oil change. 
6557 2018-10-26 16:52:41 You know what’s funny is how every time you go for a standard oil change, they always say you need something extra done to your car just to get you to pay more. Not falling for it.

6569 2018-10-26 16:51:15 You're right food prices will rise, not only as import from EU. Basic commodities and oil are brought on world market in dollars, not pounds sterling. So as sterling falls against the dollar, so everything rises, including transport of food to supermarkets, passed onto us.

6596 2018-10-26 16:48:01 I would not attribute export fall to sanctions in the first place. They started declining way earlier along with output fall. But it's true sanctions have worsened PDVSA's ability to import oil equipment and pay providers in dollars. It's a headache for PDVSA now to make payments

6609 2018-10-26 16:47:04 No, denailists are more like “why the fuck should we take responsibility when rapacious, malignant oil corporations force society into the combustion driven transportation by political corruption & bribery” They must fix this shit with their Trillions
6610 2018-10-26 16:46:46 Yall still think coconut oil is the healing of the nation ?
6611 2018-10-26 16:46:40 Exactly!!! I mean if we want to be politically correct no shows should happen on US soils than. WWE is a company. They are doing what they need to do. You gonna tell the US oh stop stealing oil from the middle east now.
6612 2018-10-26 16:46:32 Drop his ass in some hot cooking oil!

6614 2018-10-26 16:46:23 I have a feeling that the NY/CA real estate correction is going to be a lot like the oil/Texas correction in 2016. Matters, but not a death knell.
6615 2018-10-26 16:46:21 I've been to all 77 counties,  court houses,  I'm sadden what I see,  failed businesses,  dying towns.  Oil & Gas was Oklahoma's Forte.
6616 2018-10-26 16:46:09 @OfficialPDPNig.@atiku Almost a billion naira to study chemistry in Atiku's standard University, yet none of these students has invented anything..........
Not even Anointing Oil!
6617 2018-10-26 16:46:07 Obviously you do not remember the @McDonalds French fries before they changed the cooking oil.
6618 2018-10-26 16:46:04 instead of sunsidising cooking oil manufacturing companies it would have made much economic sense to subsidize fertilizer and seed companies. This wld have encouraged more farmers to produce maize and soya which would lead to self sufficiency.
6619 2018-10-26 16:46:01 4th graders created these beautiful seascape collages. We explored texture and talked about foreground and background. The mixed media is painted paper and oil pastels.
6620 2018-10-26 16:46:01 Irving was the first to say they had no interest in Energy East oil.

Btw: Canada also produces higher grade oil. It all gets ships to the US. For a real cheap price. Why aren’t all the fossil fuel acolytes screaming for that oil to be refined in Canada?
6621 2018-10-26 16:45:58 Yes, and it was also prior to mankind started to pump oil and dig for coal and consuming at a rate assuming there are no limits. The times they are a-changin' (Bob Dylan)

6634 2018-10-26 16:44:14 I think JT was smart, would wait till spring, cancel the deal, buy all the LAVS for Canadian millitary, then announce funding for a few refineries /railway to retool and switch to process tar sand, stop importing Saudi Oil.

Move like that would draw in a lot of center/right.
6635 2018-10-26 16:44:08 @SFMagicMountain just spray down that dust and oil that ride up and lets get it open #ReopenGreenLantern
6636 2018-10-26 16:44:01 Mai Munashe strikes again. She locked all the cooking oil in her bedroom now we have no cooking oil in the kitchen and she's here saying I'll get home around 8and obviously she expects to get here and find her meal ready

6647 2018-10-26 16:43:20 This student from PnG keeps telling me to deliver a lecture there 
Guess, I can tell them about the advantages of using coconut oil, whine about the gas prices and share how much I love the smell of petrol 
6648 2018-10-26 16:43:18 It's almost like your nerve ending have switch their wiring? Sounds genetic. Relatives or predecessors may have had it too.
I have a blood disorder in that my blood likes to clot, so blood thinners f life. Genetic.
The CBD oil u would want should b as strong as u could afford.

6660 2018-10-26 16:42:27 If Palestine was rich in oil, precious stones, rare metals used for atomic bombs and other ones used in belic industry and tech, then USA, Europe, Russia, China would mind Israel taking possession of Palestinian territories and would care about its people. #greed #CORRUPTION
6661 2018-10-26 16:42:24 What kind of inhumanity do we call this? ...& somehow, someone somewhere will think there is a justification for this.

6664 2018-10-26 16:41:50 It's decades before it put a dent into the need for drivers.
Technologies are there but the implementation is a long process... just look at how people are fighting just to keep burning oil. It will nice when the world goes without the pollution .
6665 2018-10-26 16:41:48 Pull up… bring extra baby oil in case people forgot theirs
6666 2018-10-26 16:41:37 Forgot to say that we in Saudi Arabia know very well that you want our oil and you don’t give a shit about us as humans or our rights!
6667 2018-10-26 16:41:32 Gotta get my oil changed
6668 2018-10-26 16:41:26 So I'm using margarine to cook rather than sunflower oil

6671 2018-10-26 16:41:06 Saudi Arabia is “hands off” for n America because it has (1) oil and (2) Muslims. #SoItGoes
6672 2018-10-26 16:41:04 You have to ask why you supported this for this long. Why haven't you submitted a bill to eliminate all aide to Saudi Arabia? Why haven't you proposed any and all oil imports from Saudi Arabia?
6673 2018-10-26 16:40:52 In the shop today are two different #B8 #Audi cars - one #Avant in for a host of @aprllc upgrades including- downpipe, intake, intercooler, and software, and an #S5 in for well...an oil change. Everybody needs an oil change from time to time

6675 2018-10-26 16:40:45 I can't believe I have to waste time this weekend getting my oil changed /:
6676 2018-10-26 16:40:44 I took my car in for an oil change and tire rotation this a.m., and they found a nail in my tire BEFORE the tire went flat.  This is amazing because my luck doesn't work that way usually.
6677 2018-10-26 16:40:40 Taking a bath with coconut oil is a dangerous game y’all. You might slip and die but your skin will feel smoother then a baby ass lol.
6678 2018-10-26 16:40:39 Lol its actually cool, an assurance and protective measure
6679 2018-10-26 16:40:36 I'm TERRIFIED of painting with oil bc I'm scared I'm gonna fuck up  that's why I bought a lot of oil colours bc f that

6687 2018-10-26 16:39:47 This isn't a bank! It's a financial firm originally established by deposits from Iran oil money to manage the oil sales flow between two countries! It's very funny that an own firm is banning #Mullahs regim... :)))))

6692 2018-10-28 23:59:32 Never thought of using argon oil! I’ve always used grape seed oil. Might have to try that!
6693 2018-10-28 23:59:26 At least an oil change is easily done and doesn't need a mechanic.
6694 2018-10-28 23:59:00 I’d say it’s justifiable.  She’s going to need liniment oil after all the contortions to make this Trump’s supporters fault.  The killer hates Trump, and everyone else.  But also Trump.
6695 2018-10-28 23:58:58 I like this argument. While were at it, can we break up oil companies, banks, grocery stores, internet service providers, radio and television networks, and weapons manufacturers?

6728 2018-10-28 23:54:52 Agreed. I fear 4 our country when a large number of our fellow citizens are so easily hoodwinked into thinking that the grifter/snake oil salesman @realDonaldTrump has the sense or intellectual gravitas to lead a boy scout troop much less than the US. It’s fear overtaking reason
6729 2018-10-28 23:54:46 Shortly there will be a salad of arugula, oak leaf lettuce, thinly sliced radishes and celery, some kale and sunflower sprouts, and a little olive oil and lemon juice and salt and pepper. #theresistanceisfoodal

6733 2018-10-28 23:53:49 Thanks! I’m pretty excited to own this grill..... plan on doing some steaks tomorrow night.

Guy at Lowe’s recommended I get the grill up to heat, and treat with grape seed oil a few times before use. Is this a good practice?
6734 2018-10-28 23:53:42 Too few school leaders of color r breaking new ground on innovation.  All the ivy league educated snake oil sales people r pushing tech without understanding culture.

6736 2018-10-28 23:53:26 I helped an older man buy cbd oil for his old sick dog and we had like a 30 minute conversation (his wife has dementia, one dog is sick and the other recently died) and today he came in to personally thank me? i almost started crying lolz
6737 2018-10-28 23:53:02 Probably squeaky things. They need oil.
6738 2018-10-28 23:52:38 Name one. Feeding people keeps them poor? Housing people keeps them poor? Do you think they want to live on $800 a month? How about we address corporate welfare? Billions in subsidies to the oil companies. Focus on the scary brown people while your pocket gets picked. Wake up.
6739 2018-10-28 23:52:37 What about carbon tax on the ships bringing oil from far away that pollute our waters?
6740 2018-10-28 23:52:36 Leave the oil in the ground. Abandon your oil & gas extraction business. Reinvest in renewable energy. Now.

6744 2018-10-28 23:51:43 @RandPaul 
Second, occupy the oil fields to make sure the Gulf states do not abonden the US and form strategic aliances with Russia & China. The current international order is not sustained and sooner or later some country will control the Gulf area. Let us do it first.
6745 2018-10-28 23:51:23 I'd go ... make trouble - make him squirm! He is just another snake oil crap person who needs a talking to. What shit thing to do to people - take money from hopeful people and tell them lies....

6748 2018-10-28 23:50:52 What about putting cooking oil on your hands? It often works with sticky stuff.
6749 2018-10-28 23:50:35 Lol do absolutely nothing. Use a lot of water leave in and olive oil.
6750 2018-10-28 23:50:14 what is frankincense oil i’ve literally never heard of that before

6757 2018-10-28 23:49:03 Having lived in Texas for four years, all I can say is their political leaders are the sorriest lot of snake oil salesmen you could imagine.  But, in a democracy, you get the government you deserve . . .
6758 2018-10-28 23:48:59 Really ? What the castor oil supposed to do and what do you do with it lol 
6759 2018-10-28 23:48:48 @Airfieldsupply Hi, do you guys make rick simpson oil ?
6760 2018-10-28 23:48:33 TY... everyone made me feel so good. I'm going to try fried Chicken wings. My lovie says she'll help me with that because "it's boiling oil, and yer too hot for burn scars"... I'm going to try a diff meal each day this week.
6761 2018-10-28 23:48:26 Yeah our master bath is big but not the girls bathroom or the half bath downstairs. That why I was think a oil diffuser would be better so it’s no so strong.
6762 2018-10-28 23:48:22 Maybe I am confused for another rig, there's oil spills all the time, UK rig only 2 years ago....I just don't recall this massive disaster in only 8 years ago.
6763 2018-10-28 23:48:06 @plpc_sanjose Hi, do you guys make rick simpson oil ?
6764 2018-10-28 23:48:00 Pricing oil and other commodities would do the trick.  In theory, ~$7T in FX reserves could then be used to pay down offshore USD loans everyone so (rightfully) worried about.
6765 2018-10-28 23:47:53 Yeah I had them on ice and since I move Thursday to boulder I’m cleaning out stock. Salt, pepper, dash of truffle oil
6766 2018-10-28 23:47:21 Olive oil equals speed
6767 2018-10-28 23:47:20 None of that worked for me  only thing that worked was castor oil that shit put me in labor within 1 hour ! But don’t do it 
6768 2018-10-28 23:47:14 I put coconut oil on my hair and I’m tryna braid it and tweet. Fail
6769 2018-10-28 23:47:14 As an oil painter, I feel like I am selling life insurance, so I know the feeling.
6770 2018-10-28 23:46:57 religion rant part 2: anytime there's a religious war, i guarantee there's another underlying reason (land, oil, etc.) and religion is being used as a justification for it to drag in lay religious peoples into a capitalistic deception where they directly contradict their beliefs
6771 2018-10-28 23:46:41 Our vet said to break fish oil  capsules in their food. It really did the trick! We bought the pills from a pet store.
6772 2018-10-28 23:46:24 In the fall/winter I wear pink sugar bc I’m still 14 in the inside and like smellin sweet hehehe 
But in the spring/summer I use a rose body spray, and I have a rose oil I use with that so I smell offensively rosy!!
6773 2018-10-28 23:46:18 What a fucking relief!  The haters had me thinking whether I needed to change my oil or my tampon. 
They're desperate, won't be too long before they start eating their own.
6774 2018-10-28 23:46:03 bio oil gel is the only thing getting my skin through accutane and this bloody weather 
6775 2018-10-28 23:45:47 Thank you shawty, I just got this new beard oil so I think that’s really helping
6776 2018-10-28 23:45:35 I filled Lin's Skell with oil
6777 2018-10-28 23:45:33 น่ารักกกก 
6778 2018-10-28 23:45:22 Yeah so they go to work for a bunch of men that happily throw equality off a cliff for a few hundred million in oil money
6779 2018-10-28 23:44:54 Oh I believe a girl can do it. Just not this one. I know my limits. 
6780 2018-10-28 23:44:48 You are 100% correct!!  It was the Arab Nations who forced the World to move their embassies to TelAviv or they were going to stop selling us oil.
6781 2018-10-28 23:44:37 Do you have a recipe for the potatoes or is it just "cut them, olive oil, spices, oven"
6782 2018-10-28 23:44:30 fellow straight edge people! is CBD oil an edge break?

6786 2018-10-28 23:43:16 Well yes of course protecting the power of his dynasty is a reason. But I think you really underestimate the value of these elements. The modern welt runs on them. Just as it used to (and in big parts still does) run on oil. And you sure don't want to say oil was not one of the..

6794 2018-10-28 23:42:18 バッキバキやぞ！
6795 2018-10-28 23:42:15 And millions will be dying in the next few decades because of climate change, but Wall Street had to have its oil economy, so the NYT ignored that Donny was mobbed up and went on and on about HRC's emails.
6796 2018-10-28 23:42:03 Slow-roll oil dripper (technical name) for dips, dressings and mayo?
6797 2018-10-28 23:41:59 Oil, jackass.
6798 2018-10-28 23:41:43 Come and buy anointing oil and drink, stop saying that thing on here like Jesus is reading
6799 2018-10-28 23:41:31 do you ever get real conservationist and get pissed at an ad claiming the pipeline running along the mackinac straits is SAFE and not CONSTANTLY at risk for bursting, spewing crude oil across the entire coast of lake Michigan
6800 2018-10-28 23:41:26 ありラジラです
6801 2018-10-28 23:41:22 apparently it's doable if they fill out the customs forms as "non-alcoholic fragrance oil" or anything marking it as non-alcoholic
6802 2018-10-28 23:41:16 A Slap On INDIA  For Protecting It's National Interest As It Didn't obeyed either with Iran Oil Cut Or S 400 Deal !  & Perhaps Modi's Propaganda Machine Of PR Jumped The Guns Right After Invitation Was Sent Pre Maturely  Godi Media Wanted To Cash In His Visit As Modi'S Victory
6803 2018-10-28 23:41:10 You apparently do not know the history as to why the capital was moved from Jerusalem to TelAviv.  It was the Arab Countries who forced the World to move their embassies or they would have cut off oil.
6804 2018-10-28 23:41:06 Pension Reform, crude oil exploration, and what he does with Lava Jato investigations are going to be the three major issues to make or break the Bolsonaro administration in #Brazil. #eleicoes2018
6805 2018-10-28 23:41:01 Gals do it!
All the major operators and service co's have gals in the field and office.
My first boss as a Drilling Engineer in Lafayette, LA in 1990 was a female.
Think Will has one too (?)
6806 2018-10-28 23:40:59 The defeated party (PT) is a member of a multinational political organization called Foro de Sao Paulo, created by the Cubans to make the int'l revolution using Venezuela's oil money... and so they did. Yet these guys are so corrupt they ended up digging their own political grave
6807 2018-10-28 23:40:55 Like those old oil lamp things. I loved those!
6808 2018-10-28 23:40:51 There's one NPC at your camp that sings about sleeping with a woman but it's poorly hidden behind euphemisms about digging for oil. If you ever hear it, it's fucking hilarious

6811 2018-10-28 23:40:18 The guidelines have informed Big food. We eat much more PUFA, SFA disappeared and heavily advised against, as is red meat. McDo used to cook fries in tallow. Now seed oils are in all manufactured food. Benefit of seed oil is we can’t tell when it’s rancid, so longer shelf life

6819 2018-10-28 23:39:31 Watching #DeepwaterHorizon is making me SO annoyed. The oil rig is on fire, gas is leaking, people injured and dying, yet a sheer bloody idiot says to (sensible) girl who wants to cut the pipe: "Don't. We don't have the authority." 
FUCK THE AUTHORITY.
I would have cut the pipe!

6827 2018-10-28 23:38:18 Omg, I used a packet of zesty Italian dressing mix on my baked chicken and it’s BOMB AF! The instructions said mix it w/oil for a marinade, but I didn’t lol. I just sprinkled it on my chicken after I seasoned it
6828 2018-10-28 23:38:11 lol i did this with tea tree oil once and i looked like a balloon for 3 days straight, i feel u b!
6829 2018-10-28 23:37:47 Homosexuality is based in material reality. Gender Ideology is a faith, and we ain't buying what you are selling. Snake oil.
6830 2018-10-28 23:37:34 I put oil in my car today all by myself i feel like i accomplished something 
6831 2018-10-28 23:37:20 Those were my Halcyon days as well. My first real honey drove a GTO with a 4 in the floor. We had to stop every 10 miles to put oil in it. I accidentally set it on fire. Was just a burned out hulk. My bad.
6832 2018-10-28 23:37:08 Grape seed oil is nurturing for skin, & I much preferred to coconut oil. Feel free to dm me for questions. Grape seed oil is less oily feeling on skin and absorbs quicker too.  Healing prayer sending your way with light too 
6833 2018-10-28 23:37:06 That looks an awful choice, processed meat in sausages, sodium nitrate on bacon with an egg all in oil.

There’s a much better way, have the egg but poach it, and choose good quality protein sources instead.
6834 2018-10-28 23:37:06 More snake oil salesmen talk Chuck. A decrease in spending is not a cut. Stop using common core math.
6835 2018-10-28 23:36:45 Yo that castor oil dont come to play. My eyelashes finna be poppin!
6836 2018-10-28 23:36:23 Sorry you had to hear that shit. Next time,,Silver Nitrate,,clear, no odor and harmless. Used it in oil patch testing chlorides. Used it on some smartass roughnecks that occasionally gave me a hard time. One squirt turns skin black for about 3 wks. Way 2 much fun with that stuff!

6840 2018-10-28 23:35:23 Get some grape seed oil and add some lavender oil to it and gentlyappy to face darlin, this will help greatly. I’m a certified aromatherapist. Please also start diluting your oils with grape seed oil instead of coconut oil, it’s hypoallergenic and better for your skin!!
6841 2018-10-28 23:35:18 PLASTIC IS THE MAIN CAUSE WHY WE ARE BURNING FOSSIL FUELS EVERY DAY, LIKE COAL, GAS AND OIL EVERY MINUTE TO MAKE PLASTIC. WE ARE DESTROYING THE NATURE, THROWING AWAY TONS AND TONS OF PLASTIC AND RUBBISH INTO THE SEA KILLING HUNDREDS OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS.?

6844 2018-10-28 23:34:13 Is #DeepwaterHorizon that time where (uk) news were reporting of an 'oil spill' from the seabed and kept up-to-date info on how the spill was being repaired? Or is that another incident that happened around the time, otherwise it means it was not fully told on what happened.
6845 2018-10-28 23:34:13 I believe only CBD oil made from hemp is legal in Idaho. I keep wanting to try it for my arthritis.

6851 2018-10-28 23:33:28 Working in the Oil Industry I was aware of the Deepwater Horizon disaster at fairly close hand but watching the film tonight hammers home how harrowing it must have been to be there that fateful day. So glad lessons have been learned from it
6852 2018-10-28 23:33:27 i have never heard of this oil wtf kind of oil does that?

6857 2018-10-28 23:32:47 Gave asparagus the stink eye for many years, now it’s a favorite.  I usually give it an olive oil shower and hit it with garlic salt.

6862 2018-10-28 23:32:29 Yeah? *Smiles a little and continues to do it to you* I’d offer you a massage, but you plus oil equals a very horny me. So that’s a bad idea for now. *Chuckles*

6867 2018-10-28 23:31:38 —- made out of oil.
6868 2018-10-28 23:31:23 A strange mishmash of different issues. If plastics are a problem, surely the answer is in reducing demand not in reducing oil production? Aren't the important specifically fracking issues that it poisons water, causes earthquakes & destroys countryside, not plastic production?
6869 2018-10-28 23:31:09 oregano oil is a great cleaner but I hate the smell 
6870 2018-10-28 23:31:04 Toasted torta bun, light coconut oil on top, cup of black tea @DontBeStalin is there anything better?

6875 2018-10-28 23:30:24 According to my SLP friend, I don’t pronounce “oi” words correctly: coin, boil, oil... I blame my Southern accent. 

I also cannot swim or ride a bike, but I’m not all that embarrassed about that.
6876 2018-10-28 23:30:22 Ha! Yes they keep sending me the cards for a free oil change as well. Sigh.
6877 2018-10-28 23:30:01 Many thanks, SU. Pooling and sharing doesn't include trillions taken from Scotland's North Sea oil, these days?
6878 2018-10-28 23:29:32 She got more roaches on her walls than oil paintings, and she still tryna talk shit?
6879 2018-10-28 23:28:51 Paging the copy desk: “When Gilmore struck oil on the property, he realized he was sitting on a gold mine.”
6880 2018-10-28 23:28:48 Is this because I tried cbd oil?
6881 2018-10-28 23:28:35 The electric oil warmers are awesome. I'm gonna buy another one for the living room.
6882 2018-10-28 23:28:26 Man my house is scented in all types of good smells. I'm done cleaning and I have my candles on in my living room to burn oils. Plus my electric oil warmers are on in my bedroom and bathroom.
6883 2018-10-28 23:28:25 Yes, please enlighten us, and possibly yourself on the damage extracting oil from the oil sands is doing? But be mindful that the oil sands are not in the top ten dirtiest oilfields on the planet!

6893 2018-10-28 23:26:16 Good advice but remember vitamin D is fat soluble.  So has to be taken with fats. I have mine with small amount of cheese in my lunchtime salad with olive oil french dressing or full fat yogurt.
6894 2018-10-28 23:26:07 How would you know, they've not TRIED left wing ideology, their country has been run by oil companies more than progressives. And this current country's been run by a Repub congress for years and it's going down the tubes with Trump as president.
6895 2018-10-28 23:25:42 Fresh oil change on my car 
6896 2018-10-28 23:25:39 brazil, like venezuela, has a state owned oil company, and it also has been a source of alot of controversy and corruption. i cant explain it entirely here, but you can see the resemblance between the situations, and that has alot of people spooked
6897 2018-10-28 23:25:20 Day 183 without sex: I cooked oil on the stove top without a shirt to feel the popping oil sting me.
6898 2018-10-28 23:25:01 Life makes both Water and Oil. Allot of Water and Oil. Our Oceans like our reservoirs fill with water and sediment every minute of every day.
6899 2018-10-28 23:24:40 It Appears Mr. Glass changed the name of his group to Pine Oil the Candida and Parasite Cleaner....Do you think our show got him unwanted attention?
6900 2018-10-28 23:24:32 They taste exactly like deep-fried chips. Exactly. Same crisp, same little bit of oily mouth-feel. And NO oil used. It’s kind of magical.
6901 2018-10-28 23:24:25 I don’t know who’s daughter needs to hear this today but...

check the  oil and coolant levels in your car.
6902 2018-10-28 23:24:14 He makes a good point. Goop is up there with those who thinks there is an essential oil for everything.
6903 2018-10-28 23:24:12 Oil?... Precious minerals?... Sex parties?...
6904 2018-10-28 23:24:07 Who wants to learn more about CBD Hemp Oil?
6905 2018-10-28 23:24:00 You miss the point if under Buhari regime for 3yrs the debts increase by $10b at Nigeria's crude oil at average of $50 per barrel. What justification does PDP has when our crude oil was $110 per barrel and Nigeria's debt was above $50. Haba,

6908 2018-10-28 23:23:43 Grew up in SD & WY.

6913 2018-10-28 23:22:53 I don't care? It's an abbreviation we have to use because of the nature of anti-Tesla actions from shorts, legacy auto makers, and the oil industry. The establishment can see Tesla will decimate their market share.

6915 2018-10-28 23:22:09 So great to see!  Also great to see all ingredients are non-gmo. That’s where the @ImpossibleFoods burger comes up short. I’ll also add they should use unrefined coconut oil vs refined. You kill all the antioxidants when you refine it. Also drop the “natural flavor”.
6916 2018-10-28 23:21:58 授業中寝るくらいなら帰ってくれ〜〜！！！！！！！！！
6917 2018-10-28 23:21:57 Yup. However, it's supported in Norway by oil revenues, and Sweden is in the process of abandoning it at a fairly rapid clip. It also only works in countries with populations of 8M or less, and where everyone is of the same ethnic background.
6918 2018-10-28 23:21:51 We use coconut oil!

6926 2018-10-28 23:21:14 Same as Canadian oil at $20. It's logistical, political and manipulated.
6927 2018-10-28 23:21:11 The country's truly grateful for your awakening!  But it was so obvious Trump had zero concern for anything other than contracts to friends in the oil business --  his hatred for Obama was motivation enough to undo the environmental protections he'd put in place.

6934 2018-10-28 23:20:04 Place it on your abdomen and it should help. Also heard I think cypress (sp) oil. I’m sure google has an answer but she sweared by it.
6935 2018-10-28 23:19:59 It's a real reality that 99% of recommendations people make for #mentalillness are for mild/moderate symptoms. No, meditation won't work with intrusive thoughts. CBD oil will make me worse. My diet is OK.

6953 2018-10-28 23:17:14 I’m going to be very blunt about this. I hate coconut oil. It just does nothing. Cooking with coconut oil is just pointless. Also stop with all those myth about coconut oil being good for skin care, it really does nothing for cooking or skin care. It’s terrible.

People should stop blaming companies for their problems.

If you don't like meat, be a vegan. If you don't like oil, don't buy oil products (probably means you have to throw away 80% of your clothes as well).

We all use oil and animal products.

7038 2018-10-28 23:02:53 so many dumbshit right-wing pundits today comparing soros to koch brothers. 

a weird comparison to make given how the koch brothers aren't jewish, and their father bankrolled a nazi oil refinery.

7042 2018-10-28 23:02:14 Venezuela have the largest oil fields in the world. They once were the richest most successful country in South America. What changed? They became a Socialist state and people lost the right to voice their objections and ended up shafted by the corruption only Socialism brings.

7044 2018-10-28 23:02:05 Yes it is. Most things that are good for you & the environment are often 4 x as much. That's why we need to ask brands such as Dove to change. I was just stating that it can be done, you can make soap without Palm Oil. It's crazy!

7067 2018-10-28 23:00:05 I just find it funny for people to nod in unison instead of acknowledging the reality that oil is here to stay and a no or yes on any measure will not change that course. So, why not vote no since you need oil to produce the many things we bitch about when we use them.
7068 2018-10-28 23:00:03 I need to rent a man for a day to take care of my car maintenance . Payment will be a good home cooked meal...

7173 2018-10-28 22:44:20 You could make profit both sides. The issue i faced was instability of the candle sticks. It was crazy. Recorded a couple of losses
7174 2018-10-28 22:43:57 Why Are Texas Voting Machines Switching Democratic Votes to Ted Cruz (and Vice Versa)? BECAUSE TEXAZZ IS BEING RUN BY A BUNCH OF REPUBLICUNT "OIL" PHUK'N HOODS LIKE RON PAUL AND HIS LIKES !!
7175 2018-10-28 22:43:54 You take olive oil and you add garlic and onions to it, somebody’s getting a blowjob
7176 2018-10-28 22:43:52 My mother’s version of this was fried pizza dough . Essentially the same fried in oil with cinnoman or powder sugar . The plain ones where used for cold cut sandwiches. Just slit the middle & put meats inside with mayo or butter .
7177 2018-10-28 22:43:39 Simple, wholesome and delicious: PASTA WITH CHICKEN SAUSAGE. Fettuccine, ripe tomatoes, grilled chicken sausage, fresh basil, garlic, Kalamata olives & extra virgin olive oil.
7178 2018-10-28 22:43:35 I have grease crammed under my nails, motor oil all in my hair, pants pockets filled with dirty.. but I think my car is finally fixed after 2 days of working on it 
7179 2018-10-28 22:43:32 Vitamin E oil is self care
7180 2018-10-28 22:43:23 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
7181 2018-10-28 22:43:10 Who she think she is lol tryna slick a can oil
7182 2018-10-28 22:42:48 Same procedure. Diff masala. But once it’s cooked in oil, you add tamarind and make the kuzhambu.
7183 2018-10-28 22:42:46 I be watching ppl at my job eating them seaweed sheets and them shits really nasty they taste like fish oil
7184 2018-10-28 22:42:42 C-P-C has cut gasoline and diesel prices at the pump by 0.4 N-T per liter from this morning on the back of a decline in international crude oil prices last week.

7188 2018-10-28 22:42:27 @LoveMySilk Does the Vitamin A Palmitate ingredient you use in your almond milk come from palm oil?
7189 2018-10-28 22:42:20 Too much oil dey your head i swear.....
7190 2018-10-28 22:42:15 another way to protect democracy is to support oil industry to help overall economy run properly and that way we would have fundings to make society assure financially and every canadian would feel represented having more money to follow their talent and develop their capacities
7191 2018-10-28 22:42:14 Coconut oil!
7192 2018-10-28 22:41:15 Does anyone at unt have valve oil for a trumpet
7193 2018-10-28 22:41:11 "Burning the midnight oil"
7194 2018-10-28 22:41:06 Not palm oil, though, avoid that for the sake of the orangutans. Plenty of other oils are nutritionally as good or better, and far less devastating to the environment.
7195 2018-10-28 22:40:57 Fourth-Graders Differ Over Giant Hinged Opening In Oil In Oil In Ancient Greeks Immediately Regretted
7196 2018-10-28 22:40:32 Do you know how many people commit suicide each year because they cannot live up to your drivel? Sounds great until someone experiences the exact opposite. You take away their chance at reality by selling snake oil.

7198 2018-10-28 22:40:12 Now imagine all pharma and agri eyes over the Amazon forest, lots of recently discovered huge oil reserves along the Brazilian coast, also a strong contingent of labor force well trained for the last 14y of left governments, that is going to be exploited as f* from now on
7199 2018-10-28 22:40:12 Every step of the way, the one female character on the oil rig was 100% right, but consistently ignored, not to mention demeaned, humiliated, harassed.   #DeepwaterHorizon

7230 2018-10-28 22:34:38 @h3h3productions smelling your bodily smells is like checking the oil in your car, checking the dip stick y'know?
7231 2018-10-28 22:34:35 Maybe try some deli mustard? Or a drizzle of oil and vinegar.

7236 2018-10-28 22:33:46 Because you think that Big Oil is the only corporation that lobbies the government.
7237 2018-10-28 22:33:44 They also support ETP (Energy Transfer Partners) who are destroying our planet with their pipelines for dirty oil.
7238 2018-10-28 22:33:43 SDF never controlled both Al-Kashma oil field, satellite imagery clear show it. Moreover, in my view, they even were not move a single meter on the Hajin town front since begin the offensive, despite the constant "kilometer" reports - at least from desert direction.
7239 2018-10-28 22:33:27 Here you go! "An adult male orangutan is carried out of a small pocket of forest after being tranquilized. It has been captured for re-release after its home forest was quickly and illegally cleared for palm oil plantations in Tripa, Aceh Province."
7240 2018-10-28 22:33:26 Who cares? Trump hates reporters so this is fine with him. And Republicans love oil so they don't give a shit either.

7247 2018-10-28 22:31:28 Ahh, great story. Thanks. Just as you leave the non descriptive flat land to the north, you come to some beautiful relief and there is the city. Cool sight coming in from the east also. What a field it was! Made Marathon Oil!!
7248 2018-10-28 22:31:17 Good luck getting the GOP dictatorship, Trump supporters, oil men, ranchers & racists to give a damn about rigged voting machines -Texas is its own corrupt country and proud of it. It's the New Jersey of the West...
7249 2018-10-28 22:31:10 Same. And it is. Pork especially. And if you mix it with a splash of vinegar and oil, makes a genuinely interesting dressing for waxy, peppery salads (radish, new potatoes & rocket, e.g).

7251 2018-10-28 22:31:00 Petrol/ oil is a hard one.

argument a few years back was that low priced US energy would be a boom to the manufacturing sector.  suffice to say it hasn't happened ...  rather to the extent the fall in the petrol deficit contributed to USD strength, it had the opposite effect

7315 2018-10-28 22:21:12 NO. I am sure our government will find reasons/excuse as to why it didn’t/won’t. Unless you are directly involved in the oil industry, you will continue to see less of your hard earned $s.

7323 2018-10-28 22:20:36 He flamed out in the big leagues, and is reduced to selling snake oil  to rubes to get attention and build chops in pseudo intellectual fox world. Think of how empty and bitter he must be inside.
7324 2018-10-28 22:20:16 Imo yes to stripping out oil but no to ag. Just because the price effect is so big in energy. Ag has been, us and will be a solid export base and including it could illustrate tariff impacts that would be missed otherwise.

7461 2018-10-28 22:02:25 Every US Administration ( reps and dems) since the 30's has been complicit with the Brutal Saudi Regime one who subjugates women,gays and non-Muslims and anyone who questions the crown. Follow the oil find the money find the agenda.
7462 2018-10-28 22:02:07 Because they accept petrodollars.  Saudi Oil buttresses the US dollar as petrodollar and therefore the world currency.
7463 2018-10-28 22:01:51 There is no public space. We gave it to cars. And cars are the reason for oil wars. And oil wars are the reason for Islamophobia.
7464 2018-10-28 22:01:50 Sigh. I’m not talking about the IPCC. Understanding global warming predates the IPCC and is based on the work of thousands of scientists from all over the world and from many types of institutions (including oil companies) working since the 19th century.
7465 2018-10-28 22:01:42 LETS GO HAWKSSSS! Drain the Oil! #Blackhawks
7466 2018-10-28 22:01:35 I thought doing a base of a huge canvas in oil paint before bed was a good idea now I’m huffing fumes a it and I’m gonna be crawling to college tomorrow

7468 2018-10-28 22:01:28 At federal Jagaban need oil rig and petroleum minister for his brother but at state he wants more of the taxes revenue to his Alpha beta wallet, company that generates billion but don't pay statutory levies. Ambode is not giving into that, but PMB has signed agreement for that.

7474 2018-10-28 22:00:57 I'm also a winger. 

One of my favourites is leeks softened in olive oil then add water to make it more saucy then chuck in olives and wholegrain mustard. Stir on a low heat for a bit then grate in loads of cheese and have it on toast or with pasta.
7475 2018-10-28 22:00:45 Hope so.
7476 2018-10-28 22:00:36 id like to close this off by saying that the fashion industry is the worlds leading cause of pollution right after the oil/gas industry

The kings & queens can't stop complaining that they can't go out in public for a nice meal, paid for on the backs of the working poor, elderly, disabled & the poor anymore. THANK GOD that Russian oil dude in their back pocket has promised them retaurant home delivery! WHEW!
7484 2018-10-28 21:59:35 Woohoo!! Congratulations!! 
7485 2018-10-28 21:59:33 Get over yourselves: all energy related investment must be channeled into renewable energy technologies to protect humanity & save the planet for our existence, not into oil/gas.
7486 2018-10-28 21:59:31 Only if you promise to release my radiator oil
7487 2018-10-28 21:59:26 Jon you have a platform which u could have used to save lives. Everyone knew it was wrong 2 trade with the despicable SA. Most of us don't have a way to get politicians - with shares in weapons companies/oil companies - 2 listen 2 us about the unfolding tragedy in Yemen. You did.
7488 2018-10-28 21:59:10 No harm no foul. (It won’t remove oil, sweat and bacteria, but it at least covers up the smell.)
7489 2018-10-28 21:58:47 Oh wow that is really a nice photo. To be honest he fascinates me with the amount of things he is involved in. He must be a very busy man and what an interesting life too. Thank you for sharing that..
7490 2018-10-28 21:58:45 The strawmen is that monopolies are granted by government.  Evidence says otherwise.  One of the largest examples of a monopoly, and the justification for the american Sherman act, was standard oil.  They had zero to do with government edicts. /2

7496 2018-10-28 21:58:13 The sauce:
4 cups packed basil, blanched briefly in boiling water and shocked in ice water
1⁄2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1⁄2 cup finely grated parmesan
1⁄4 cup pine nuts
3 tbsp. finely grated pecorino
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
+Normal pasta, 1tsp butter to the mixture
7497 2018-10-28 21:58:03 Make an olive oil and salt scrub and make sure the consistency/ratio makes it more like a paste. Rinse your face with warm water then when your skin is finally moist and warm exfoliate with ithe scrub mixture. Rinse it off, then do your regular skin routine and moisturize.

7503 2018-10-28 21:57:18 The Right is experiencing a white nationalist resurgence that's plain to see and you don't want to deal with it. This isn't the time for more snake oil, it's time for principled black conservatives to stand up to the white nationalist in their midst.
7504 2018-10-28 21:57:18 ...at some point due to the massive variability in different healthcare situations. The technique/method of improving safety should fit the individual scenario.

7513 2018-10-28 21:55:36 Bit of a Hammer on the Weekly for Brent Oil Spot off $75. Not a beautiful example but the 'faster' Daily Candles look bullish. Turned up off bottom Bollinger Band. If Oil rises that could help FTSE100 due to Oil Weighting.

Good ol' boy customer: "I'll vote (responding to TV pol ad) for Cruz, but something bothers me."
Me: "Trump insulted his family, but he embraces him now?"
GOBC: "That's it! He can't be counted on!"

7528 2018-10-28 21:53:10 Brent Oil Spot could be turning up. It did Bullish Engulfing Candle Thursday and then this was 'confirmed' by a rise on Friday. Note also it did a 'Long Tails Doji' Wednesday which shows one of these marking a Turning Point. Heiken Ashi Candles gone Narrow and White.

7538 2018-10-28 21:51:46 I use coconut oil moderately (1TBSP daily) and triglycerides are fine (around 57).  My cholesterol levels are pretty consistent--high, but I don't worry about total cholesterol.  But then I'm on a VLCK eating plan for T2 DM

7556 2018-10-28 21:49:35 So I have a cold/sinus infection. I’m looking to use eucalyptus oil to soothe my headache and congestion. But I’m not sure what type of oil to use. I’m not well versed in essential oils. Please help lol.
7557 2018-10-28 21:49:29 "And when we run out of oil we'll... well we didn't think that far ahead because it's outside the scope of our 5 year plan the shareholders will be dead by then anyway, like everyone else."
7558 2018-10-28 21:49:22 Right. I’m not one of those “Essential oils over medicine” people. We use lemon oil because it’s just more concentrated than eating five lemons. I add Tea Tree oil to my facial cleanser, and we use peppermint for aches (the cooling feeling is nice.)
7559 2018-10-28 21:49:18 Jeez, Ha, well he’ll need his speedos soon as we will all be swimming in oil, not long now!

RedHat have always paid lower then Industry Avergae due to perks but with IBM would expect a salary increase due to the burden of the oil tanker so to speak 
7572 2018-10-28 21:47:36 Here's a tip: Fuel prices follow oil prices and the AUD exchange rate.

7581 2018-10-28 21:46:41 Call Nenshi, he will appreciate that at least one person in the province supports the idea of a multi-billion dollar two week long party. Who cares about the struggling oil industry and Alberta economy?  
7582 2018-10-28 21:46:39 You should be fighting for a healthy oil & gas sector in the most environmentally responsible oil patch on the planet, Alberta.  Every responsible barrel of oil in AB prevented from getting to market is replaced by oil from places like Russia; Russia spills 90,000 bbl oil per DAY

7601 2018-10-28 21:44:11 Kind of lame to just blame 100 companies like that. If you want them to stop selling oil, stop buying their products.
7602 2018-10-28 21:43:57 I just seen a video of some king crab and lobster cooked in some garlic oil and covered in butter and spices. Damn near drooled on my phone
7603 2018-10-28 21:43:57 jamaican castor oil too!!!
7604 2018-10-28 21:43:34  “Oil”
7605 2018-10-28 21:43:32 To little to late Moronscum it’s not just oil it’s tax on tax on tax on tax real price before tax 50c after all taxes 170c
7606 2018-10-28 21:43:24 @RedDeadBase #RDR2 I’m enjoying this game immensely but if I have to eat, shave, take a bath and oil my gun why can’t I loot everything off of a body? It would be nice to be able to loot clothes and weapons (to sell or use).
7607 2018-10-28 21:43:14 My state is the only one that doesn't tax the oil and gas drillers, or the refineries. We have the highest gasoline tax in the nation because they pass those taxes onto us at the pump instead. When we make it here.

7609 2018-10-28 21:43:12 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
7610 2018-10-28 21:43:12 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7611 2018-10-28 21:43:08 Also: about essential oils because there IS scientific data about vitamin C and THAT is why my family uses lemon oil a lot!
7612 2018-10-28 21:42:54 But can you separate the terrorists from innocent before bombing them no you can’t do just kill all of them and take what you want from the beginning their oil
7613 2018-10-28 21:42:49 The twitter account. After you open it, you add oil and stir.

7616 2018-10-28 21:42:32 Why not race on oil
7617 2018-10-28 21:42:31 I’ve been fortunate to watch Adam Vinatieri kick at both the RCA Dome and Lucas Oil Stadium. Well deserved history. #Colts
7618 2018-10-28 21:42:25 @gplama did a piece on wax I recall .. bit of an effort though. My indoor favourite is Green Oil White Super Dry Chain Wax, stays clean as and doesn't go black! @GreenOil and it's sustainable! Love the smell too

7621 2018-10-28 21:42:02 I know that Canada isn’t perfect but taxing normal Canadians won’t do anything. The best way to reduce emissions is to allow companies to do it on their own terms, that’s how the US increased their oil price and reduced their emissions at the same time.

7626 2018-10-28 21:41:35 I stay on the go I just got a oil change  a month ago im already over the miles 
7627 2018-10-28 21:41:26 Cook this tweet in oil Frying on Vacation
7628 2018-10-28 21:41:23 Not even mentioning the costs of inevitable clean ups which we will be fully on the hook for impacts on communities and tourism .. and the fact that indigenous peoples and other Canadians alike are strongly opposed to this 15 billion dollar oil subsidy..
7629 2018-10-28 21:41:22 I’m no oil painting but if that’s the way they want to play it. I say if they don’t shag fuck em
7630 2018-10-28 21:41:20 Soup/easy to prepare items? Nut butters/jams? Easy veggies/apples/bananas? Pasta w/ olive oil or butter +a veggie topping is easy, filling and usually not too bad on the stomach? Hummus/or some other semi healthy dip? I swear I'm gonna cook and just leave it in your freezer.
7631 2018-10-28 21:41:14 Literally been at Walmart for THREE hours waiting on a oil change.
7632 2018-10-28 21:41:06 sometimes  listening to oil of every pearls un insides is self care
7633 2018-10-28 21:40:42 It was supermarket own brand, it sunflower oil..... yummy 
7634 2018-10-28 21:40:37 Ok. Keep eating "Carnivore", software man. And don't forget: more fish oil.

7642 2018-10-28 21:39:46 Never ending promises. Everything about SL is "next month" or "next year". The cowboys in Texas had nothing but few pieces of wood when they drilled oil. And then you have the DP World claiming to spend $400m for a simple easy port.
7643 2018-10-28 21:39:41 So is this not a minus to you.. 
Obasanjo earned more with lower price of oil and an economy not as developed as now? 
Something definitely is wrong
7644 2018-10-28 21:39:36 Any kind of olive oil or??
7645 2018-10-28 21:39:35 Which one of you have money from old Oil&Gas tankers to pay 250k/yr for each IT manager ? Indians cost only like 20k offshore routine work, 140k for onshore heavy work & substantially lesser cost to govt & community
7646 2018-10-28 21:39:32 just go to whole foods and buy fish oil,

7649 2018-10-28 21:39:23 It is for sure him promoting himself! I agree. 
The palm oil thing is important though.
7650 2018-10-28 21:39:21 I had one drink on the last trip. My dinner buddy doesn't drink, so it was a little boring. Plus we were there with like 10,000 oil field workers.... I didn't need to get too drunk!

7653 2018-10-28 21:39:02 Lord Jesus Christ, shepherd of your Church, you give us new birth in the waters of baptism; you anoint us with saving oil, and you call us to salvation at your table. Dispel the terrors of death and the darkness of error. Lead your people along safe paths, that they may rest
7654 2018-10-28 21:38:55 .@CNRLCareers, we know the truth about your decaying oil and gas wells. When will you create jobs in clean up and reclamation instead of mining and drilling? #abpoli #CleanItUp #polluterpays
7655 2018-10-28 21:38:55 Yes it is. He’s the second coming of Butch Davis. A snake oil salesman who spews bs and throws co-workers under the bus. The only thing Hue’s worse at than coaching is being an effective leader. He’s done nothing to warrant keeping his job.

7662 2018-10-28 21:38:05 What the federal government then took the states to court for was in respect of offshore facilities around oil producing states; the states wanted offshore resources to be in the calculation  of their 13% while the fed. govt refused that....
7663 2018-10-28 21:37:46 I should be studying but instead I’m cooking a huge unnecessary dinner while dancing to a 90s playlist with the eucalyptus oil diffusing. At this rate, nobody can tell me anything.

7665 2018-10-28 21:37:41 Again you don’t acknowledge the fact all her people are anti oil activists. And they have actually gone and protested pipelines while in office. Seriously what fantasy world do you live in. Even a kindergarten kid could understand this logic.
7666 2018-10-28 21:37:39 宜しくお願いします！
7667 2018-10-28 21:37:37 I’m so annoyed I took my car to get a oil change at 11 and it’s still not done.
7668 2018-10-28 21:37:36 He's either a genuine guy who has the interests of @OfficialBWFC first and foremost in his mind and heart or the biggest snake oil salesman going. I've come across a few of his type. 'Don't worry, everything's under control.' It's always 'jam tomorrow' with them.
7669 2018-10-28 21:37:30 عجب سریشی!!
7670 2018-10-28 21:37:25 I might change my oil and leave at 5 . LMFAO

7672 2018-10-28 21:37:07 To change my oil and just go ahead and leave back to base or stall till 7 then leave
7673 2018-10-28 21:37:06 That crying of that woman in that Bayelsa State Flood news report always brings tears to my eyes. Nigeria is a very selfish nation!. This State produces oil for the whole Nigeria,yet nothing is given to them. @tvcnewsng @BussySolamiTVC
7674 2018-10-28 21:37:04 Follow the oil money
7675 2018-10-28 21:37:00 U r right what r we going to do?  The leaders mind is on six grade level. So he follows evil. We need anointing oil
7676 2018-10-28 21:36:53 92 laps to go. Still waiting for the safety crew to clear the 42 from the track. Losing a lot of oil. Trying to keep it contained and get the car on a rollback rather than drag it around the track.

7678 2018-10-28 21:36:39 An enlightening facial mask, sparkling cobalt blue, with grapeskin, ylang ylang oil, and exfoliating crushed lemon seed. The bottle it comes in is beautiful.
7679 2018-10-28 21:36:37 your hair is probably rough because you did 2 rounds of shampoo & 3 rounds of conditioner, that would've stripped your hair of its natural oils completely, it should be ok in maybe a day because it will regain some oils but use like a hair oil/serum in the meantime
7680 2018-10-28 21:36:21 Lengthy cleanup underway and it looks like we still have a lot of yellow left. The 42 hasn’t moved and there is a ton of oil dry everywhere.
7681 2018-10-28 21:36:14 The 42 car blew up and dumped half the oil in Saudia Arabia on the track. Long clean up ensues...

7686 2018-10-28 21:35:44 Its pretty much flour, salt, oil and food colouring by memory! We used to make it a lot as kids. Would need to google the quantities.
7687 2018-10-28 21:35:24 Didn't your parents teach you not to put all your eggs in one basket. I am not for or against the oil and gas industry. I am for energy security through diversification. If I am wrong so what. If you are wrong then there will be chaos. I rather error on the side of caution.
7688 2018-10-28 21:35:23 Andrea is my mom she told me to use an oil mask for my dry skin and to stop smoking weed

7695 2018-10-28 21:34:35 Because the biggest crowds were around the wagon of the snake oil salesman back in the 1800’s. The miraculous cure for what ails you. They believe him. And it puts the blame on someone else for their situation. Doesn’t matter if it’s fantasy, they are tuned in to reality TV
7696 2018-10-28 21:34:28 In other news, I just today realized that, in my panic for “earliest IKEA slot,” I took Election Day, so instead of getting an oil change pre-Vegas, my Sunday is suddenly sh*t-canned & I’m in the back of an Uber, rushing to the last hours of Early Voting.

Which will be worth it.

 Marinate  Beef in 1 2/3 cup Olive Oil and  Basil for 1 hour.

 Finish in the oven and serve.

7700 2018-10-28 21:33:48 I got away from eating most of that when I moved off the farm. Certainly not looking to have turtle soup today but venison marinated in garlic and olive oil, lemon juice, and baharat spices make delicious kabobs.
7701 2018-10-28 21:33:26 Would love to support the Oil in Chi-Town. However, I settled for Germany and hope Draisaitl continues his great performance from yesterday. #LetsGoOilers
7702 2018-10-28 21:32:52 You cant complain about the environment because we eat lots of meat and even invasive species. Hell we eat anything in this new Epoch thanks to human evolutionary changes. Farmers are more ripped off by regulations than oil issues and CA will always have a water problem.
7703 2018-10-28 21:32:34 help @odsteve ? a car just laid down oil on a 1/3 of the track. red flag this

7706 2018-10-28 21:32:02 I do not seek to change your views. Being a conservative is as important as being liberal.

But for all our sakes, learn to pick your leaders better & to discern those selling you snake oil.

7711 2018-10-28 21:31:17 True:  The press covering reality-based events is not an “attack” on Trump.  He’ s just selling the coverage that way, off the back of his snake oil salesman’s buggy (and sales are through the roof).
7712 2018-10-28 21:31:09 You never specified Dr! So suck it “Mark”! Diane is ALWAYS more respectful than many of us! Myself included! I know many people who are up in the oil sands who spend more time here than with their families! You don’t hear them complaining!! Show some respect for others.
7713 2018-10-28 21:31:08 All the oil on the track. We all know it's slippery when it's wet. Just add to the beating and banging!

7714 2018-10-28 21:31:06 So don't use them, but don't force our states to participate in your "green" technology. Despite Obama's claims, alternative energy is exponentially more expensive than coal and gas. It's why he subsidized their business and heavily taxed coal and oil.

7738 2018-10-28 21:28:20 My family's homefries recipe is usually done with yellow onions, potatoes, and just using olive oil, salt, and pepper. Now that I know I like poblano peppers, I might have to try it!
7739 2018-10-28 21:28:20 Just go straight to the point
7740 2018-10-28 21:28:19 Chad: Was there oil?
Earl: Yes.
7741 2018-10-28 21:27:57  try using oil as your alternative for regular moisturizer every other day; using regular household olive oil helped my skin a lot I usually use it when I’m out of lotion
7742 2018-10-28 21:27:54 Even one square meal is becoming a luxury for most. The value of the Naira against the Dollar is the worst in the history of Nigeria. The cost of fuel, where available, is the highest in the history of this so-called oil producing country.
7743 2018-10-28 21:27:15 Like oil stew with @mrjollof
7744 2018-10-28 21:27:05 So yea, again despite ugly truths on both ends. Oil is cheaper and should be regulated a bit more and it creates Eco stuff that is more expensive because of the cost of oil and raw materials which further damage the earth. Oil is still king
7745 2018-10-28 21:27:01 How the heck is the "ethnic" food aisle still a thing in grocery stores? Salsas and hot sauce can go with condiments, soy sauce next to oil and vinegars, tortillas next to breads, etc. Are those items too "exotic" for Americans?
7746 2018-10-28 21:26:24 Combined with the mullahs’ own predilection for corruptly lining their own pockets, it is little surprise that the country with the world’s second largest gas reserves and fourth largest crude oil reserves is now facing economic meltdown.
7747 2018-10-28 21:26:15 there will be nothing new in the reply. Prices go up because they can charge whatever they like, send the cash overseas and pay zero tax in Australia. The PM should ask himself, not the oil companies.
7748 2018-10-28 21:25:52 like have you tried olive oil I mean
7749 2018-10-28 21:25:49 She's just checking the engine oil
7750 2018-10-28 21:25:38 Castor oil is your friend. For your edges and your ends.
7751 2018-10-28 21:25:27 olive oil?
7752 2018-10-28 21:25:20 We can agree to disagree there. I don't think there's any legitimacy to anti-trust, nor any objectivity either. They exist solely to extort people and destroy companies to protect inferior cronies from competition. Just like was done to Standard Oil.

7756 2018-10-28 21:25:09 No-one deserves this turnaround in fortunes like @elonmusk @Tesla
Taken unprecedented risk and succeeded despite the US government, the oil lobby, the shorters and the 'expert' naysayers. If I had one, I would take my hat off to them 
7757 2018-10-28 21:24:58 nah dubai is oil
7758 2018-10-28 21:24:49 I was literally going to drive up to SF today just because but I need an oil change so maybe I’ll do that first and try again next week
7759 2018-10-28 21:24:28 Pat it dry with paper towel, rub 10ml of oil over it and cover with salt, Sit it on a bed of sliced onions and add a little bit of boiling water to the bottom of the tin.
7760 2018-10-28 21:24:25 Nonsense. A ship engineer should have fact checked this article. The shipping industry does not intend to use marine diesel oil to meet that goal: they use engineering solutions for example, using larger ships. Shoddy journalism.
7761 2018-10-28 21:24:08 Olive oil              ME

7767 2018-10-28 21:22:55 Nonsense, we’ve been hearing doomsday nonsense forever, if it’s not the apocalypse it’s an ice age then overpopulation, then oil was running out, then global warming now climate change and on and o it goes. Don’t believe the hype.
7768 2018-10-28 21:22:44 No mo gas smoking, that oil feild money kalling my name
7769 2018-10-28 21:22:15 A liberal doesn’t like abortion and doesn’t have one. Conservatives don’t like abortion and tries to ban them. A liberal wants to save money on gas and buys an electric car. Conservatives want to save money on gas so they start a war, sacrifice US lives so they can control oil.
7770 2018-10-28 21:21:51 let me put some coconut oil on my hair !
7771 2018-10-28 21:21:44 I want to eat palm oil rice and wash it down with white wine
7772 2018-10-28 21:21:42 Oh dear looks like she’s been on the wine again! She needs about 3 bottles to bed that man of hers! 
He’s no oil painting is he?!?
7773 2018-10-28 21:21:37 Super piece of kit. Black peppercorns, butter, olive oil, garlic and cheese my favourites. Used apple wood and it’s great 
7774 2018-10-28 21:21:10 I'm going to be very angry, aren't I?
Let's watch big oil trash our environment yayyy  #DeepwaterHorizon

7777 2018-10-28 21:20:25 We warned our clients for this. It will destroy the western manufacturing base and big oil companies. Self destruction of the west is in full progress.
7778 2018-10-28 21:20:18 Tremendous, Spain and Germany do not have large defence industries it is easy for them to do it! The UK and France have substantial defence industries! It would be like France saying they are closing their off shore oil drilling for the environment! (They don’t have one!)
7779 2018-10-28 21:20:13 I think I’m done with this oil field shit
7780 2018-10-28 21:20:05 Olive oil for the boobies, you'll thank me later.
7781 2018-10-28 21:19:59 Sorry. Ken said the biscotti I made isn’t making it to work. Used my homemade candies almonds in it so must have great flavor. My recipe also used butter not oil. Happy Sunday!
7782 2018-10-28 21:19:56 I don’t do CBD oil but I do smoke weed and it does so much for me! My anxiety gets so bad I get nauseous and a couple hits can clear my mind and ease my stomach so quickly.

7785 2018-10-28 21:19:19 Oh, you're worried about overspending eh?  Why not google how much that fucking tax cut aimed at the one percent just cost us.  Are you watching the budget deficit skyrocket now?  How about what we pay to subsidize oil companies?  Are you outraged about any of that???
7786 2018-10-28 21:19:06 Oil spill tonight 
7787 2018-10-28 21:19:06 They're def better fried. Though I sometimes just pan fry them in coconut oil on the stove, if the filling is already cooked.

How?
7798 2018-10-28 21:17:14 Ahh, I never heard of Cetaphil before. I use Aztec clay mask each week with peppermint oil, sometimes almond and black seed oil to moisturize. Ok gotcha. Sometimes mines get really dry or oily, but thank you anyway 
7799 2018-10-28 21:17:05 Did the 66 drop an oil line or something? #NASCAR
7800 2018-10-28 21:17:01 Is two full plates of chicken breast, some shrimp and veggies too much for dinner? :// what worries me is the soy sauce and probably a little bit of oil that my sister used to cook
7801 2018-10-28 21:16:53 Can these soybeans be used to feed the poor? Make cooking or heating oil for the poor? Feed shelter/rescued horses instead of sending them to Japan via Canada for slaughter? Can’t some good come from it? Think outside the box!!!

7816 2018-10-28 21:15:12 Skip the oil and go full butter. Melt the butter and toss the seeds in it, lay it out on parchment paper and dash with sea salt, or any sort of salt you like. Garlic salt works, and salt with red pepper is good too.
7817 2018-10-28 21:15:10 And actually I said more respected. That doesn’t mean completely respected as the word on its own implies. Provinces rejecting our oil needs and not seeing it as it is a Canadian issue is more fault of our conservative past leaders I’m afraid. This is also nothing new.
7818 2018-10-28 21:15:03 (Halve skjermen er dekket av røyk fra sigaretter, karakteren som snakker har dritkule shades, mustasje) oil.. that black motherfucking thing.. oh baby it makes my head spin..
7819 2018-10-28 21:14:49 That's right. Lets be more dependent on the whims of foreign oil producers.  Let a utility bill at home go higher. Pay more at the pump, food, airline, consumer products almost everything. Yes I say damn fracking, hello Venezuela, Iran, iraq and Saudi oil. Canada get richer.

7821 2018-10-28 21:14:23 Typically I only use Shea Moisture’s skin care products, mainly for the clean ingredients. Argan oil to moisturize daily. Witch Hazel to tone.  I still get break outs and my skin as been the worst this year
7822 2018-10-28 21:13:49 Everytime a trained professional recommends a moisturizer I realize I don't understand the difference between hydrated skin and decades old existential anxiety about 'oil' that will cause my teenage skin to breakout. The patriarchy doesn't sleep. Thank you.
7823 2018-10-28 21:13:46 So, after a ton of research on my anxiety (which gave me more anxiety) I’ve decided to try out CBD oil. Does anyone else use it? Where do you get it? There’s so many options & I know the purer the better, etc. but literally...where y’all getting it? Lol
7824 2018-10-28 21:13:44 The summer/winter time saving was initiated at a time oil price skyrocketed and the industry represented over 50% of the GDP, with shifts kick-starting at 6 a.m. With services accounting for 70%+ of the GDP and work kick-starting at 9:00 a.m., time saving is a quaint concept.

It occurred to me that industrial mayo is made with pasteurised egg-yolk so I whizzed it into sheep yogurt with a dab of olive oil and a squirt of lemon juice and it worked pretty well. The emusifying effect seems to survive cooking.

7848 2018-10-28 21:10:44 You are wrong, the oil company was NOT required to study the fault lines and the EPA does not decide on development & aquifer stress, cities & counties. Read the Measure before you embarrass urself further.

7855 2018-10-28 21:10:11 Question: how electricity is produced? Oil combustion, nuclear and coal +renewables... . The potential srink in retail oil revenues will be compensated by the increase of electricity demand (considering also the electricity inefficiency when moved from production to consumers).

7878 2018-10-28 21:07:05 Haha leave me alone man. There was something in the oil that looked a bit funky so I was shining my torch on it 
7879 2018-10-28 21:07:01 To quote Notley, "in Alberta we ride horses not unicorns."  Until the masses start driving EV's we still need oil.
7880 2018-10-28 21:06:54 What do these morons think democrat billionaire donors want?We know what republicans donors want. Low wages, no healthcare, no SS, Medicare/aid, lead in water, coal ash in water, oil in aquifers, govt land for free, hire illegal immigrants w/no penalty, low education among masses

7882 2018-10-28 21:06:36 Iranian government has prepared plans to counter the impacts of returning U.S. sanctions by maintaining oil exports above one million barrels per day, Jahangiri (Xinhua reports)
7883 2018-10-28 21:06:36 She came in in the middle of the oil crisis & actually did a good job. She deserves another chance. I'm voting NDP, don't want political infighting from UPC to distract from economic progress! Besides, the UPC started to sound like Trump & that vitriol & dirty politics is ugly!
7884 2018-10-28 21:06:31 Ok lets see other side. If you see #US helped bringing revolutions in following countries and none of them became stable afterwards. #Iraq #Afghanistan #libya #Syria #Egypt. You want iran to be added to the same list... Where millions of civilians dies just #US capture #iran oil.
7885 2018-10-28 21:06:29 I know right. Harry must've been bootlegging to have enough oil for a deep fry.

So why wont we have revenue challenges, is the economy magic? You guys killed Nigeria and we know that.
7889 2018-10-28 21:05:58 I hardly have enough oil for my own.

7893 2018-10-28 21:05:22 "We learned that no analyst has agreed with the government’s assertion that ending domestic oil and natural gas production will lower global greenhouse gas emissions. No evidence exists for the claimed lower overall emissions, and more than likely it will increase emissions."

7900 2018-10-28 21:04:19 If you're going to speak "FOR THE RECORD," double-check your definitions. Steyer is not *just* a billionaire, but the word certainly applies to him from what is in the public record. He is one of many fossil-fuel billionaires, having made his money from coal and oil.
7901 2018-10-28 21:04:17 It was just like a natural reflex  I know the phones are ip67 rated so water wouldn’t do any real damage. Phones all cleaned up but there’s still a little oil in the speaker/mic 
7902 2018-10-28 21:04:01 With my daughter's kitten we had to add a little bit of extra virgin olive oil like a a quarter teaspoon.  He had a prolapse from straining.  But always a good idea to check with vet.

7912 2018-10-28 21:03:27 Also really looking forward to hearing the specifics on your plans to rip healthcare away from the poor so you can give your oil company more tax breaks
7913 2018-10-28 21:03:21 Uh huh. And what's your take on all the subsidies for oil and gas? And all the cosey relationships between legislators, regulators and that industry? Arguing that it's all just one big conspiracy by scientists, science orgs, economists, heads of industry, etc, is a bit bonkers.

7926 2018-10-28 21:01:46 It certainly is a very challenging time for many.  We’ve had 12 sessions (from 150-1000 registrants) to re-engage oil and gas workers to new opportunities, and have worked closely w/ PSI’s and training institutions to increase training capacity for in-demand tech skillsets.
7927 2018-10-28 21:01:45 What the fuck? How can you possibly be in favor of Colorado 74? All it does is give oil & gas companies the right to sue the state if 112 also passes.
7928 2018-10-28 21:01:44 Adding almond oil & jojoba oil to that mixture is  as well!
7929 2018-10-28 21:01:41 I just keep having thoughts that reinforce I'm definatley getting older lmfao. All I can think is "I need to do laundry, and do my girlfriends oil change and tire rotation next week." haha chores are life now

7934 2018-10-28 21:01:04 The government of Botswana has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Stuart Townsend in a osnaburg wig.
7935 2018-10-28 21:01:01 Rubbish. In the relatively short term the demand for oil will decline. Most of the oil already discovered will never be extracted. It's an industry with a declining future. The oil rich nations have a problem we can avoid.

7981 2018-10-28 20:53:40 Back to the Supermarket Sweep marathon, I’m not sure why they stock the store with anything other than turkeys, garden hoses, cooking oil and Pampers. No one is ever loading up on the crackers.
7982 2018-10-28 20:53:34 Why not develop jobs in that London plant that manufacture green energy & begin to wean ourselves off much oil consumption?

8011 2018-10-28 20:51:07 So ignore what's happening with crude oil prices, they have dropped, yet our petrol prices have not moved, The dollar has firmed, but the petrol prices have not moved. Why the disparity between Auckland and Wellington, Auckland cheaper with a regional tax on? Not the govt's fault

8016 2018-10-28 20:50:08 Just stop using oil, which can be done, most of the planet could be off oil in a decade,  the top oil companies are all owned by the top banks,  monatary policy is based on oil.The poor can only try to vote out these rich parasites,the rich have a vested interest in doing nothing

8019 2018-10-28 20:49:35 Sorry to be pedantic, but you don't see oil rigs looking out from Aberdeen. Plenty of oil supply vessels, but nae rigs. Inland, there may be food banks,  but nae rigs visible fae Aberdeen, unless under tow to Dundee. Your point still stands re wealth though.
8020 2018-10-28 20:49:35 74 isn't a good one, it would allow oil and gas to sue the state if they limit it, the owner of the rights could sue for loss of value. Big oil would go to town on the state so they wouldn't restrict them.

8022 2018-10-28 20:49:25 The government regulating production industries wouldn't effect in any way the competition they have, since they're providing... services.
But oil companies have absolutely everything to loose tho, and they always had a strong grip on US politics, we went to WAR for them.

In the other hand an adult Fred Koch built an oil refinery for the Third Reich that was used to fuel Nazi warplanes & the family's long association with Holocaust deniers is even uglier
8030 2018-10-28 20:48:56 I’m sat covered in baby oil to get my tan off cause I can’t scrub it off because of my tattoo 
8031 2018-10-28 20:48:45 I put too much oil in my car
8032 2018-10-28 20:48:43 as high out of water as she sits no oil on her :-)
8033 2018-10-28 20:48:41 Lol... Don't be so sure. We need more of a man than cooking oil
8034 2018-10-28 20:48:29 Need sum more oil for my pen

8036 2018-10-28 20:48:03 When 5th graders write recipes: "Find a different medium pan with 1/2 to 1 inch thick vegetable oil and heat on medium-high." Are we supposed to just have pans with oil in them lying around?
8037 2018-10-28 20:47:36 We could easily pay the penalty with the difference in price between Saudi oil and Canadian oil if Libs hadn’t killed the Energy East pipeline
8038 2018-10-28 20:47:29 US will get much more and cheaper oil because Saudis screwed up and will try to make it up. Who are they going to sell otherwise? In 20 years, California will hardly buy any oil for transportation. That’s 60-70% drop in demand...

8062 2018-10-28 20:44:36 Once worked at the Shell garage on Tylacelyn in the days of “Full Service,” as the Americans say. Steep learning curve. Tried to put oil in a customer’s engine through the dipstick hole. Customer unimpressed.
8063 2018-10-28 20:44:20 Rolled up to get an oil change and tire rotation. As soon as I said I wanted the tires done the service tech took a few steps back, looked at the size of my Jeeps tires and mouthed

8064 2018-10-28 20:44:12 It pills with some of my other skincare so I tend to use it either with a face oil over top or I use it as a mask, and wash off after an hr or so.

8069 2018-10-28 20:42:41 Explain how KSA is a "necessary" partner. Necessary to keep oil prices low? Necessary to counter Iranian regional influence? Necessary to support Western arms manufacturers? Necessary to protect Israel?

8070 2018-10-28 20:42:37 yeah we know about the bullshit, chaos in the middle east is key to keeping oil price high, and it's good for US and UK (and France) who are producing it.

8142 2018-10-28 20:33:10 Caller Sharon MacLise is a broker in Edmonton, Alta.: In Alberta, we have had a tremendous pressure on our job situation, on our economy. Decreasing oil prices, but also public policy that's happening.
8143 2018-10-28 20:32:47 If you could give Dan and Phil one gift, and money/practicality were not an issue, what would you give them?

I would send them a commercial-grade popcorn popper with all the goodies: gourmet kernels, coconut oil, a big scoop, and festive buckets too.

8145 2018-10-28 20:32:10 The only thing PDP could do when oil was $120 per barrel was to initiate projects. And APC, at $30-$60 per barrel were building and completing projects. Shame on PDP
8146 2018-10-28 20:32:06 Also a lot of water and baby oil being spilled on it, plus @Jonah_Rock throwing it around a bunch of times... 
8147 2018-10-28 20:31:48 And who is opposing it? Big oil companies? What the fuck does that tell you? They don't want to pay, that's why. Why are you trying to protect people who want to shit on the environment?

6 months ago I was on golf team.
I woke one morning no ability to move arms or legs because of pain.
12 doctors later, annointed w oil and prayed over by church, thousands of people praying for me but No doctor has any answers.
Would love to discuss.

8164 2018-10-28 20:29:12 2500' setback from occupied buildings is not too much to ask for. Greedy oil and gas boys want it all. Stealing our resources to sell it back to us or the Chinese for a penny on a Dollar. Poisoning our increasingly rare water.
8165 2018-10-28 20:28:31 I had the same problem and I tried farsali before putting on my foundation and it kept my skin hydrated. Now i just use like a regular oil primer but it still works like a charm. I think any of them will definitely help, you just have to find the right balance with your skin

8169 2018-10-28 20:27:56 Sorry, is this not your quote "The big oil sands players are integrated (little exposure to the WCS/WTI differential)".  I don't see the reference otherwise.  The data on spot physical volumes sold in the various grades is available from the screens that manage spot trading.
8170 2018-10-28 20:27:23 Hey MAGAt, without seaports the Midwest wouldn’t see a dime. Without Gulf drilling and offshore oil ports you wouldn’t have a drop of gasoline. Where do you think coffee comes from?

Trump is as much of a coastal freeloader as exists. He doesn’t pay his taxes.

8171 2018-10-28 20:27:03 Wait awhile! Why come to us for help! There are several oil rich Arab countries in the region who should step up. They have a direct benefit to get stability in the region. Why do we always need to step in only to have them stab us on the back at the first opportunity?

8174 2018-10-28 20:26:34 That's a lovely idea, but one side wants socialism and plantations. The other side wants individual freedom and prosperity. Oil & water. I'm not willing to compromise America to play nice with those who hate all she stands for.
8175 2018-10-28 20:26:24 I remember gas shortage while ships full of oil/gas waited off shore due to stupid or incompetent people in DC. Carter was President. Fortunately we didn’t have to use the ration coupons printed in 1979.
8176 2018-10-28 20:26:06 This is so painful to watch. My heart goes out to Tigger. Will he tolerate a Thundershirt? Will he allow a heavy blanket to lie under? Try lavender oil in his collar. Or a DAP product that can be attached to his collar or used as an atomizer. Ask your vet. Hope something helps.

8267 2018-10-28 20:13:54 Oo that sounds good though...did you at least have...butter substitute instead of oil to cook it in?
8268 2018-10-28 20:13:49 extra version all of oil 
8269 2018-10-28 20:13:29 The biggest foreign fundraising are right wing. The Fraser Institute gets big dark money from US right and oil companies. Does @LindaFrum object to them?
8270 2018-10-28 20:13:17 If you still have the pain or discomfort & you have cloves/clove oil, put it around the gum area of tooth etc. That helped me last year when I had to wait to get to a dentist the Monday. Also, painkillers especially Mybulen. Strongs !

8277 2018-10-28 20:11:50 @DoveUK it's amazing but maybe you can push it a step forward and stop using palm oil from suppliers who don't care about our environment?
8278 2018-10-28 20:11:50 First of all Gadaffi was trying to get rid of all international monetary organizations and use the gold and oil to back the currency of Africa. But if course America dont lik to see black ppl get up in life so they labeled him a terrorist. God help us all in Guyana.

 At one time Nigeria was developed by exporting palm oil to Singapore & Malaysia a poorer country than #MyMotherLand# then. Today it is the reversed. Singapore is a safe Heaven. Nigeria?? I challenge you to be the Lee Kuan Yew of our time.
8281 2018-10-28 20:11:25 Also: yeah, Prescott Bush was a Nazi, CIA invaded Iran over oil, silicon valley has been fine with accepting Saudi petrodollar funds while starving & bombing Yemini babies, Obama supplied drone target data.

8290 2018-10-28 20:10:08 This was done to mitigate borrowing more loans. Nigeria had the chance to save when there was oil boom but one certain GEJ refused to save but allowed further looting!

8298 2018-10-28 20:09:09 As evidenced by much of the thread preceding these comments, they don't even connect failing public schools, police misconduct, or govt efforts to control the oil industry by bombing oil nations to taxation.

8308 2018-10-28 20:07:46 Only reason ICE was crap compared to a horse was because the journalists at the time actually thought you had to wait thousands of years before horse poo finally turned into oil.

8320 2018-10-28 20:06:06 Replaced by who? Pinochet, a dictator. In Iran in 1951, we had the 1st democratically elected leader of Iran, Mossadeq. He nationalised the Anglo-Iranian oil company and was subsequently eliminated by CIA/MI6 in 1953 and replaced by the Shah. US foreign policy is hegemonic

8323 2018-10-28 20:05:58 OK so I literally learned about this last week: most pizza restaurants use a blend of real cheese, partially skimmed milk, and vegetable oil for the "cheese" that's on top.
8324 2018-10-28 20:05:49 True! However the current 'retirement boom' was for decades a 'working and paying taxes boom'. The deal was always - we pay now and take it out when we are old. Retirees are only doing that - not their fault governments have 'lost' it all. (And 'lost' all that vast oil/gas money)

I wrote all of my goals down on paper, and went over them daily, prayed about them, and even anointed them with olive oil.
8330 2018-10-28 20:05:18 Not surprised that Fezzan's oil & gas production is receiving more attention than the terrible living conditions of the citizens in the South.

8340 2018-10-28 20:04:32 Oil has risen considerably in the last year and is priced in dollars, throw in the exchange rate movement and even if the oil price was static we would still be paying more.

8342 2018-10-28 20:04:23 Now I imagine you don't give a hoot about groundwater contamination. This isn't the only problem. The large amounts of water used in fracking can't be returned to water cycle. Water -not oil is the real problem. But again no one cares. The dollar, the dollar bill yo! matters.

8357 2018-10-28 20:02:46 Agriculture is Nigeria's most viable alternative to crude oil in our strive for development. But still, government polices are stifling the very few who are interested in this sector. @MBuhari @atiku @MoghaluKingsley @feladurotoye @YeleSowore Nigerians need to know your plans.
8358 2018-10-28 20:02:45 Iv never used Liz Earl but the Ylang Ylang oil slows down the process of oil that your skins secreting which is what keeps the pores open and exposed to dirt (that creates spots ) if not it might be hormonal mate x
8359 2018-10-28 20:02:35 Con eso , como por ejemplo mandan a parar la generación de energía renovable para poner a trabajar las de búnker x q necesitan vender el búnker , pues ya sabemos q ellos tienen el control y la venta de full oil
8360 2018-10-28 20:02:33 You can do that when you have a squillion euros because your country, by a geographical fluke, sits in oil and gas fields. But huge credit is due to them for managing it and not letting this wealth destroy their society.

8365 2018-10-28 20:02:12 Man I used to do that when I was a kid. Somewhere in Bosssier Parish in the Sligo oil field, there’s a 1979 lid of Columbian gold. In a mason jar.   I never was able to find it. And nobody knew I buried it there. So it’s still there. I should have hidden it when I was sober.
8366 2018-10-28 20:02:02 Why there?????? Going in the oil business????

Most such outlets use canola oil and palm oil derivatives. Absolute trash for your health.
8376 2018-10-28 20:01:05 So the belief in chevron does not matter when you lose the incentive to buy outdated systems or promises (like desalination.

8397 2018-10-28 19:58:18 Thank you for wishing me luck on my next car purchase. I don't have problems with the requirement for oil and gas. I imagine eventually we will have a transition. You take care now. Those jobs at @OilGasCanada are going and won't be back. Tell kids to go into other fields.
8398 2018-10-28 19:58:02 Oil and gas is NOT the only industry.
8399 2018-10-28 19:57:42 The garlic oil smells divine (reached home without any leaking!)
8400 2018-10-28 19:57:42 Lil Cheetah is the Vegetarian keemstar. The military would have chewed him up and spit him out. I've seen it before, they won't hesitate to kick you out if you aren't with it. Charlie wasn't put on this earth to topple foreign democracies for oil.

8404 2018-10-28 19:56:29 The angostura lot want to destruct it. It's what they do.

They are nervous of all that oil pumping out of #HorseHill.
8405 2018-10-28 19:56:28 Ever since my families puppy passed away my dogs behavior has been SO BAD, so today I ordered her a bottle of cbd oil. I know many people are against giving their dog supplements, especially cbd, but I need something to help calm her

8416 2018-10-28 19:54:53 Try seeing past filter bubbles from your lefty friends like Google and try @DuckDuckGo. The left doesn't care about privacy and only cares about brainwashing. That's why eco is costing us more than oil when they come to tax!
8417 2018-10-28 19:54:52 Nothing will humble you like hearing oil and gas guys talk about their work and the figures involved. God of Elijah, do it for me. Plis.

8424 2018-10-28 19:54:04 I don't expect you to buy an EV. I want to buy an EV. My 19 year old minivan is needing replacement. She's a good Toyota but I am looking for a new EV Toyota. My feeling is that citizens will do this w/o any government intervention and this will end the oil industry IMO.
8425 2018-10-28 19:53:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
8426 2018-10-28 19:53:45 They make all constructions with sand... smh they creating erosion... they making them continents sink. Why do they insist in hurting Mama Nature! Leave her sand & oil alone!

8430 2018-10-28 19:53:21 Alberta is more respected? Quebec and the Maritimes do not want our oil, B.C. absolutely does not want our oil. The Americans are taking our oil, but instead of the oil being discounted $20+/barrel, they are paying $20+/barrel. That’s respect? It is the opposite, complete contemp

8435 2018-10-28 19:52:46 Wouldn't you know it! They slept in after ducky chicken brek. Put some 'safe' oil on their poor dry skin, nice brush; they had to nap #donotyouknow? They quite like "Romanov"film. Keeps them abed. Nice trot last night. I think this may be an afternoon foray, then night.~~ H~~

8440 2018-10-28 19:52:08 #DragonBear 

Isn't the motivation for China to pursue a Dragon-Bear alliance largely driven by Russia's role as an alternative supplier of Oil & Natural Gas that exists outside of the US Sphere of Influence?
8441 2018-10-28 19:51:55 He should send a message and cut off Saudi oil.
8442 2018-10-28 19:51:49 So so so disagree - I roast aubergine chunks with oil and a little chilli and it’s good from everything from veggie kebabs with garlicky yogurt or hummus or with noodly pasta or in plov mmmmmm
8443 2018-10-28 19:51:42 Oil changed in the VW and Volvo.  Parking brake works on the Ford (which is getting close to being a tolerable Winter daily).  Not bad.
8444 2018-10-28 19:51:40 Olive Oil, I love Popeye and would like to spend time with him.
8445 2018-10-28 19:51:37 To me, roasted pumpkin seeds is less about enjoying the the seeds of a gourd as a snack and more about the triumphs of oil and salt.
8446 2018-10-28 19:51:32 He isnt cool. I broke that down for sure . 
Isnt the UKOG LSE board strange. Some weird posts even for my standards.

8451 2018-10-28 19:50:49 Every generation since the 60’s, there’s been a disaster waitingto happen. Oil wells drying up, ice age, acid rain, sea levels would raise due to melting ice. Nothing of their “scientist”predictions ever happened.
8452 2018-10-28 19:50:49 Brent crude rose by US73 cents or 0.9% to US$77.62 a barrel, and the US Nymex price rose by US26 cents or 0.4% to US$67.59 a barrel. Over the week Brent fell by 2.7% and Nymex fell by 2.2%.

8453 2018-10-28 19:50:47 I ripped the palm out of a pair of summer mitts when I came off many years ago on a oil patch on CS7. Rode to office and then got sent to the local NHS walk-in centre for them to cover up the roadrash on my arm as was a *little* beyond the office first aid kit ;P
8454 2018-10-28 19:50:43 Palm oil a product that is causes huge deforestation problems round the world. Threatening hundreds of species and adding to global warming. Not sustainable.
8455 2018-10-28 19:49:59 Haha I can’t find an oil CAP at no auto stores lol wtf am I suppose to do then!!!!???
8456 2018-10-28 19:49:55 Somehow Exxon’s scientists are in on the scam too. And Shell Oil as well. Go figure.
8457 2018-10-28 19:49:55 Are you an informant for the oil industry now?

8460 2018-10-28 19:49:48 Outstanding. Lot of snake oil salesmen pushing garbage out there. Love the 7/7 hero one in particular!
8461 2018-10-28 19:49:41 Secretly, I would say no. Oil is Nigeria's biggest income on the budget. The government probably fears that if solar systems work well, demand for crude oil and it's sister products will decline. This will be "bad" for the budget.
8462 2018-10-28 19:49:36 Is CBD oil the new avocado toast for the vegan curious?

Works well for me, I can't get the normal methods to work lol
8467 2018-10-28 19:48:19 I’ve lived in LA for 6 years but just became an Angelino because I’m considering oil pulling

8469 2018-10-28 19:48:01 Be sure to salt and pepper the asparagus, and oil it before you toss it in the oven. Cook for 10 minutes or so
8470 2018-10-28 19:47:42 California has decent beaches, mts, Yosemite, wine country, lake Tahoe, etc. Texas has oil polluted beaches, pine trees, Cadillac ranch, the hill country, Barton springs. Their quality of life is both not rated  high due to overcrowding but more backwards aholes live in Texas.
8471 2018-10-28 19:47:37 Puff puff ain’t easy to get right, it’s a combination of taste, texture and experience . It needs to have that squiggy soft feel, and not for the sake of my health but for the experience... the right amount of Oil left on my hand
8472 2018-10-28 19:47:26 Finacial agreements, border laws, trade laws, environmental regulations, oil prices, energy regulations manipulating markets, currency markets.... Here, groups representing a few have tremendous lobbying forces, camapign influences, besides so few people own 90% of all media.
8473 2018-10-28 19:47:10 Sure there is a fracking boom in the USA. But I don't see oil demand increasing as the economy will IMO slow down. Interest rates decline ends. Stock markets tumbling. Cycle of money you know. Fracking does contaminate ground water. But you believe what you will. Indoctrination.
8474 2018-10-28 19:47:08 That should be a resounding YES! and if EVERY country did the same how long would the saudis last with no buyers for their oil and no sellers for their arms?
8475 2018-10-28 19:47:02 Apple, Google, Microsoft, Comcast NBC, and what GE? That accounts for tech. Then there’s Walmart... and car makers are pretty huge. Then there’s Boeing and Lockheed..... I think we could probably do like 20 companies and maybe 50%. Oh we forgot about big oil. BP, Exxon...

8487 2018-10-28 19:45:28 interrogation and trial. That the Saudis have oil resources that the world need does not make them above principles and rules guiding international relations. No stone should be left unturned to give meaningful justice to Turkey and Khashoggi's family. Just views. Thanks.
8488 2018-10-28 19:45:24 You mean GWBush, who created them when he got rid of Saddam & his army he needed to run Iraq. Rmbr he also said oil $ would pay for the war...Obama had nothing to do with it. He had to carry if on as prescribed by Bush. Pull out your head, its unbecoming...
8489 2018-10-28 19:45:23 @foundmyfitness is this the oil you talked about on Rogan?
8490 2018-10-28 19:45:19 Nice. Should have been Hylton castle with mags pouring oil on Ashley from the top from sports direct bags with some away fans
8491 2018-10-28 19:45:03 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8492 2018-10-28 19:45:03 Jeanette, why is CED trying to lure talent from YVR when YYC has the second highest unemployment rate of major cities in Canada?  I am a professional engineer with a MBA and had to find work in the USA.  Am I missing something? We should be looking to re-train oil & gas workers?

It's low on salt for my tastes which is good because I can always add whatever kind of salt I please. I'm worn out of hipster peanut butter manufactured by hippies who rip you off with a jar of oil butter.
8499 2018-10-28 19:44:30 hey, the next 10 days, 2 years, decade, whatever...they’re going to suck. do what you can to shore up your self care resources. bake two cakes and freeze one for winter. make a molotov cocktail. take a bath in CBD oil. give yourself a home manicure, short and sharp for fighting.

8504 2018-10-28 19:43:40 And teatree oil and water. Add that to the list
8505 2018-10-28 19:43:38 I use turmeric and honey and lemon juice. I don't know about the one with palm oil, but okay, hope it works.
8506 2018-10-28 19:43:33 I've tried the peppermint and tea-tree oil trick. Didn't work. #DoctorWho
8507 2018-10-28 19:43:23 Everyone know, but economic benefits $ oil.
8508 2018-10-28 19:43:21 Must be right from the oil Well, artisan style gasoline.
8509 2018-10-28 19:42:52 Shocker - oil lobbyists not happy.  I am sure you can bribe a few politicans to make it go away - isn't that your standard modis operandi?

8512 2018-10-28 19:42:39 Oil money
8513 2018-10-28 19:42:31 Investment in technology is what reduces emissions.  Moving engines from oil powered to electricity powered is a big start.  The auto manufacturers don't want that.  Electric vehicles are almost maintenance free and has less than half the moving parts in them,  It'll hurt profits
8514 2018-10-28 19:42:27 Okay let’s just make it an announcement: 
Yes I was seeing both. One got a DUI, wanted to go work oil fields forever & needs to be alone for a while to process that a family is out of the picture right now. The other one is a whore.
8515 2018-10-28 19:42:22 Yes i use jojoba, lavender, and eucalyptus mixed together or any argan oil based "beard oil" (walmart has em, cremo brand, good to find any similar with tea tree in it) i also use the ORS brand olive oil hair lotion after shampooing but not with the oils (shampoo ~3x a week)
8516 2018-10-28 19:42:21 and their fascist money....the Koch brothers' father did work, like build an oil refinery in Hamburg, for Hitler...he also did work for Stalin
8517 2018-10-28 19:42:13 You have to mix every condiment in your fridge with every oil in your cupboard and drink it
8518 2018-10-28 19:42:12 We face climate extinction yet you smear fear uncertainty and doubt about the ONLY company giving it's ALL to get us off oil... Tesla. Why? How much money did dirty energy pay you? I expect it from WSJ but YOU? Can't accept this
8519 2018-10-28 19:42:11 Give olive oil a try...for me thats the best remedy following hot water bottle... Muscle ko relax du after that...
8520 2018-10-28 19:42:10 And that would be a big gulp of castor oil
8521 2018-10-28 19:42:07 OPEC quadrupled the oil price between 1973 and 1974, hence the high rate of inflation in the mid-1970s.  This had nothing to do with being members of the EEC.
8522 2018-10-28 19:41:50 Also ... Go-To preventative powerhouses for just about anything are high quality Oregano oil once a month and colloidal silver. If the oregano oil upsets your stomach, that means it's working so take more. 'Not medical advice'
8523 2018-10-28 19:41:45 Folks are going towards electric cars. Automation will ensure more efficiencies in transport of good. 3-D printing will also impact supply chain. It's amazing how our world is changing. Oil won't be gone fast but it will gradually go down IMO as citizens change their habits.
8524 2018-10-28 19:41:31 Think oil in oil.
8525 2018-10-28 19:41:17 i never knew that putting oil in my hair after a shower would make it less frizzy
8526 2018-10-28 19:41:16 Noooo. I left some palm oil by the bathroom door for you. Use it
8527 2018-10-28 19:40:58 I only did the oil change which was $60 with a coupon I had but idk any place that would do all of that for 60
8528 2018-10-28 19:40:52 I kicked a load outside work while wearing motorcycle boots, then panicked when i thought the brownish liquid was oil from my bike only to realise after checking my bike it must have been from the leaves 
8529 2018-10-28 19:40:47 trying to go without the lavender oil pills, we'll see how it's gonna work out...
8530 2018-10-28 19:40:35 @AriFleischer - David Koch is not Jewish. His father, Fred, was a Nazi sympathizer and built an oil refinery for Hitler.
8531 2018-10-28 19:40:28 I don’t fuck with brass knuckles anymore after my brother got me a stizzy it’s all I ever use .... stay loyal to the oil 
8532 2018-10-28 19:40:25 Definitely need to get the tin & the fat (olive oil works well) smoking hot. I heat it in the oven then put it on a low hob while I add the batter., then straight back in the oven.  Will sizzle like crazy but your Yorkies should rise!
8533 2018-10-28 19:40:11 Oil sands produce about 10% of our total GHGs. Canada's GHGs have fallen over the past 10 years, Per Capita GHGs are down ~ 18%.  Still, Canada could stop oil, stop driving, stop breathing and it will make NO diff to temps, climate. NONE. The big emitters must stop coal power

8536 2018-10-28 19:39:51 So you or someone close to you have a beard? I need your help. Beard oil and shaving cream for the Christmas season? Yes or no or??? Anyone? Bueller?
8537 2018-10-28 19:39:48 First off
I hear you; thoughts running through your head( mostly negative) & your body is so tense you can feel like the tin-man squeaking "oil can."
It happens & helps you appreciate where you are
8538 2018-10-28 19:39:42 I like popping yellow kernels in olive oil and seasoning them in salt, pepper,  and oregano.

8543 2018-10-28 19:38:46 I needed my oil changed over a 1000 miles ago and my mom just saw it and she's pissed now lol I'm sorry I really can't do anything right

8545 2018-10-28 19:38:30 I love Alberta just you do. However, your vision has been nothing but contempable to the hundreds of thousands who have lost their jobs in the oil and gas Industry. Saddling up to be their champion is far too little to late. Shame on you Madame Premier.
8546 2018-10-28 19:38:29 Disappointed when I see clickbait crap like this. Would expect better from @T_Nation 

When you mix bad content with good content, it ruins the good content.

It's not an oil & water combination.

It's mud and water.
8547 2018-10-28 19:38:25 cbd further decreases inflammation, modulates the opioid system, increases blood flow to the brain, and improves overall cognitive function. Keto is great, but using CBD in addition to the keto diet provides the biggest rewards. Because CBD is often in MCT oil, it's a great match
8548 2018-10-28 19:38:25 Might as well throw up a chart oil the world oil price. The petro-Canadian dollar valuation is largely linked to energy prices. Now who is being disingenuous?

8557 2018-10-28 19:36:41 Yeah. People in Scotland seem to think we have that fancy oil that you get money for! Silly Scottish people.
8558 2018-10-28 19:35:52 My two cents... Economists often miss the point that huge areas of the globe are still unexplored for mineral resources. They also forget that new technologies allow the exploitation of resources that were previously uneconomical to produce -shale oil, tar sands-.
8559 2018-10-28 19:35:50 What a day! Lunch with the Rome Chapter of Hell's Angels and a pressing of our oil!

8568 2018-10-28 19:34:30 Ignoring facts and refuting science is the Conservative way.

Etc. Etc.

But the speech was an hour, which I'm sure is about 57.5 minutes past your attention span.  So you just watched what CNN wanted you to see?  Right?

The choice to know is yours.
8579 2018-10-28 19:33:27 How do you do. I still have 9k, running the 1200 oil commission. I unlocked NC from the gacha too :D

8592 2018-10-28 19:31:18 Plus they use peanut oil which is cool if you don’t like crispy fries lol. Peanut oil doesn’t crisp fries and make em crunch. Gotta use canola.
8593 2018-10-28 19:31:15 I need to know. Do you use CBD oil? 
8594 2018-10-28 19:31:08 Paella yum. I found some Spanish olive oil at a store in NC. It is the best olive oil I’ve ever tasted.

8599 2018-10-28 19:30:45 OMG RIGHT? We claim to ‘honor’ our heroes by applauding them in the stadium stands. Why don’t we honor them by not sending them to fight oil wars, making sure they get the psych & healthcare & other benefits they’ve been promised, and making damn sure they don’t end up homeless?

8606 2018-10-28 19:29:58 Zimbos are not known for critical thinking. How is it possible that a nation with academic institutions would let public figures like ministers and the state broadcaster announce that a witch has discovered oil? Today some "prophet" claims to have found the cure for AIDS.

8612 2018-10-28 19:28:10 this oil change is taking ENTIRELY too long
8613 2018-10-28 19:27:29 The collapse of the Libyan state is a key indication that the West didn’t care about Libyans. They only want the oil to flow trouble-free and the state to be a weak voice in the Arab world. The West would do the same w/ Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states if given the opportunity.

8615 2018-10-28 19:26:43 Everyone one here loves fried potatoes. Peel 3 or 4 baking potatoes, slice thin, put in covered pot with oil. On high, flipping frequently for about 10 minutes to get crispy brown on outside, then reduce heat to low for another 20-25 min until tender in middle. Onions optional.

8618 2018-10-28 19:26:36 It's possible. Info from @UCRiverside (2015/2017) points to soybean oil causing more obesity & insulin resistance than fructose. Also, research from @UniofAdelaide (2011) showed soy consumption having a high correlation with obesity irrespective of caloric intake.
8619 2018-10-28 19:26:33 @Browns The play calling is horrendous, our fundamentals are juvenile, and our consistency is the equivalent of mixing oil and water.

This big question is can I find schmaltz at the grocery store because I got none and it’s way better than vegetable oil.
8642 2018-10-28 19:22:34 That was the plan for those hungry for oil and natural resources

8645 2018-10-28 19:22:07 Worse still a country that is an oil powerhouse citizens have to endure the noise and pollution of generators.
8646 2018-10-28 19:22:05 Poundland yorkshire pudding tin. Pros: it's very consistent. Cons: it only cooks 4 at a time. The above took six batches to cook.

Also, remember to preheat the oil properly - I used a mix of sausage and bacon fat left over from the previous day, mixed with a bit of vegetable oil

Yes on BM1 is the end for AK.
8653 2018-10-28 19:21:14 Hey, if they got paid in the end, good for them. And yeah, the squeaky wheel gets the oil.... to an extent. My question was if it had just ten years of bitching with no pay off... then what’s the point?
8654 2018-10-28 19:21:01 Should’ve put oil at the bottom of the fryer
8655 2018-10-28 19:20:59 Yeah kale is so bitter but maybe zucchini even though it's not really considered a green veggie it's yummy when u just use some fresh garlic olive oil salt pepper I often spiralize mine an make them look like noodles.

8664 2018-10-28 19:19:33 AND bc we are tired of second rate oil revenues and an assclown throwing us into debt at the rate of 5.3 billion donations to dying socialist causes. AND Especially when Nationalism is taking over the world.
8665 2018-10-28 19:19:18 I have been using CBD oil on my son and have nothing but amazing results from non verbal to verbal I believe in it 100 percent

8671 2018-10-28 19:17:47 @tedcruz is the monster found at the bottom of an oil well. Hide your children!
8672 2018-10-28 19:17:40 When you do vehicle maintenance for a living and your boyfriend is 3,000 miles over on his oil change  bothers my nerves
8673 2018-10-28 19:17:39 Does he realize you clean ALL parts of a weapon with gun oil...? And that it’s not edible... ?
8674 2018-10-28 19:17:38 And he blocked her as soon as he sent this "apology"
8675 2018-10-28 19:17:15 #RT @SexAdviceBot: Great Sex Tip: when you're going down, try using essential oil while they spank
8676 2018-10-28 19:17:11 There were so many Fake Left people at Standing Rock who were infiltrators, informants, mercenaries and agent provoceteurs as they helped out the oil company, the local police, the FBI and the CIA too I think. The U.S is a corporatocracy/oligarchy/plutocracy, surprise surprise.
8677 2018-10-28 19:16:46 Не знаю даже. Но лично меня очень часто прикалывает делать что-то хорошее. Мне нравится хорошо относится к каждому человеку, и пытаться понять/узнать поближе каждого. Очень часто из-за этого моё мнение о людях меняется. В основном, в лучшую сторону
8678 2018-10-28 19:16:44 Can I just drown my body in cbd oil
8679 2018-10-28 19:16:44 Peppermint oil will do wonders!
8680 2018-10-28 19:16:33 either but if your using on food veg oil
8681 2018-10-28 19:16:30 because IMO the foreign interests who support the dems want to industrialize, want us to buy their oil, want to mess with our currency. its all attacks on usa.
8682 2018-10-28 19:16:27 Meh, CEO of a Calgary oil company saying same thing albeit politely
8683 2018-10-28 19:16:26 It is fact crude oil is poluting Charna Island and all efforts is being made for removing it, but no body is thinking for pulling out this precious Oil. Alas!
8684 2018-10-28 19:16:24 une cooking oil?
8685 2018-10-28 19:16:22 Try castor oil, hair oil, or enforce our laws.
8686 2018-10-28 19:16:19 Nigeria could afford to continue subsidising those commodities because the price of oil can maintain our lavish lifestyle.Then something happened, the price of crude oil crashed because the White man discovered how to convert shale to oil and started using other energy sources..4
8687 2018-10-28 19:16:13 I’m not thrilled with PETA on account of euthanasia and recommending snacks with palm oil, but I’m with them on this issue.
8688 2018-10-28 19:16:12 Enough oil & plaintain
8689 2018-10-28 19:16:06 The best indication of the

8692 2018-10-28 19:15:45 My mother seems to think all my life problems can be solved by soaking my head with coconut oil 
8693 2018-10-28 19:15:14 like my fuckin skin hurts !!!! I keep putting all this coconut oil on  never again smh !
8694 2018-10-28 19:15:08 STAR-CHILD BRAIN: Texas should secede and use its massive renewables potential to do socialism, leaving all its oil and NG in the ground.
8695 2018-10-28 19:15:01 Lol. Which lot
8696 2018-10-28 19:14:54 Its the coconut oil + insufficient sleep.
8697 2018-10-28 19:14:47 Yeah I know but my point is why the f*** would the Democrats and liberals want to shut down an Industry oil and gas that keeps people employed and then expect people to pay high taxes when were unemployed they are completely insane
8698 2018-10-28 19:14:45 It's a a bit more complex: 
1. Some Indian companies already scaled down/stopped buying Iranian oil>even if they'd continue to buy, volumes would be signif reduced; also they look for some waivers from US
2. Sinopec & CNCP have not booked Iranian oil for Nov but IR oil likely +
8699 2018-10-28 19:14:36 never mind that building i always see is indeed for oil 
8700 2018-10-28 19:14:25 Yes the govt does encourage,but we must realize that oil is still our main source of energy here, and this is where we are lagging behind in comparison with first world countries. The renewable energy renaissance in Africa will be private sector driven though

8703 2018-10-28 19:13:58 What's the Tory policy on the 2 child cap and the rape clause? Still no word about dark money  and ur strongest response is the fish card. Tory scumbags have been plundering Scottish waters for oil for decades.

8706 2018-10-28 19:13:25 .@UA_SBS, Please ask Prof. Noam Chomsky about Pence's use of the word #COWARDLY for the remote (not direct bodyslam, punching) method of sending 13 bombs to "enemies" targeted by Trump.

Cowardly describes US jobs sending bombs to SaudiArabia to kill Yemeni kids for oil routes..!

8708 2018-10-28 19:13:10 First lemme start by saying you can call me dirty. It's my choice. I eat before brushing. I used to do opposite but in 2014, I took swallow and soup after brushing and rushed to school but the oil stuck on my teeth so it was looking like I didn't brush, I was embarrassed that day
8709 2018-10-28 19:13:06 Everytime these devils take Sand from ocean floors & dig for oil.
They literally killing your future.

Humans volunteer to be Killed unbeknownst to them.
And your Church, Mosque, Temple and Synagogue helping Th devil.
Go Figure
8710 2018-10-28 19:13:06 Is an oil check on that list?
8711 2018-10-28 19:13:05 Some hispanics are white, some are black, and most are mestizos that have a wide range in skin color, so probably not ok. Though I don't care if people dress like "Mexicans" at a fiesta, doesn't bother me at all. However, blackface will forever be a controversial subject.
8712 2018-10-28 19:13:02 Like Cod Liver oil, they stomach you all in the hopes that you will do what they believe no other president has done...PLUS the factor that really cares NOTHING about that, they just are happy someone who makes them feel less like an outcast, that their racist views are OK...

8717 2018-10-28 19:12:30 It creates a false equivalency in their favor.

Koch is the physical embodiment of big oil buying the government. They are why executives don't go to jail when oil spills ruin whole ecosystems.

Soros got rich in markets & probably donates more than he needs to offset his taxes.
8718 2018-10-28 19:12:29 Think you'd get mad watching Mark Weins 
He eats them raw , deep fried , chilli oil all forms aki
8719 2018-10-28 19:12:27 Still to this day of my attended meetings the Long Eaton Firecracker 500 displays are yet to be beaten. Airbombs launched from oil drums that gave us daylight for a couple of seconds.
8720 2018-10-28 19:12:05 Yet London generates more revenue in a single week than oil does in a year, just London, not even the rest of the UK
8721 2018-10-28 19:11:52 Can technology fix bigotry, racism, and nationalism? None of this matters with the current administration rolling back regulations for coal and oil. Maybe next admin?
8722 2018-10-28 19:11:51 TINY BRAIN: Norway can only have all those social programs because it is small and oil-rich.

MEDIUM BRAIN: It’s actually easier to have social programs in a larger country with more borrowing power.

COSMIC BRAIN: Texas should secede and nationalize its oil to do socialism.
8723 2018-10-28 19:11:36 Maybe they are for oil
8724 2018-10-28 19:11:24 One of my biggest things Is I ALWAYS keep my guns Clean. You should be able to field strip and wipe your clean white T on any part and not see anything but a lil oil.
8725 2018-10-28 19:11:13 Hate when I go get an oil change and they try to talk to me into getting other stuff fixed. Like no I came in here for one thing and one thing only

8735 2018-10-28 19:10:30 Jeremy Corbyn has said unequivocally that a Labour government would ban fracking and arms sales to Saudi Arabia. That's what you get from an incorruptible politician who can't be bought by oil companies and arms manufacturers. It also explains why corrupt neoliberals hate him.
8736 2018-10-28 19:10:23 My mom: you not gone eat yo food?
Me: nah, I gotta smoke first.
Her: that’s of the devil... where’s my oil!?

8744 2018-10-28 19:09:30 The majority oppose it... Near their homes. Personally I think that would be the same for coal power station/mines, oil rigs, wind farms, or nuclear power stations. It's the "not in my back yard" attitude, doesn't prove anything.
8745 2018-10-28 19:09:17 You look amazing here. Like an oil painting

8769 2018-10-28 19:04:00 Today I found out that my aunt Patty carries annointing oil in her purse...

I found this out because she whipped it out at the table during lunch at a busy restaurant.

8777 2018-10-28 19:02:33 The medicine is tough to take.  Republicans are in bed with the energy companies thats why you Russian Republicans deny science/climate change.  You all sell your souls for campaign contributions from big oil, gas and coal.  Then when you need more you call Russia.

8819 2018-10-28 18:58:36 I started with fresh cranberry and sugar to make cranberry sauce. But I ended up adding mustard oil, red dried chilli, panch phoron, garlic, chilli powder and it became cranberry chutney. #DeshiProblem

8822 2018-10-28 18:57:56 Kathleen did get out of jail yet she was facing a 15-20 yr prison sentence for elder abuse, a crime she never committed. Nexus really wanted this family punished. Their 'crime' was opening their mouths (Kathleen & her son). Nexus really wanted that oil pipeline in North Dakota

8832 2018-10-28 18:56:53 We currently sit on the largest oil reserve. The problem is our rate of consumption. This is why we buy from Saudi Arabia. With any luck if we manage to survive this 7 degree hike in global temperature over the next 80 years we will have sustainable energy and not need oil.
8833 2018-10-28 18:56:42 We use coconut oil

8955 2018-10-28 18:44:14 @Oil_Drop Technocrats began ruling the real world decades ago, and have screwed some things up. Now they're starting to ruin sports, the last remaining playpen for adults.

8959 2018-10-28 18:43:44 Canada got what they wanted which is keep chapter 11 and to get rid of oil but personality. The US no longer has any say in where Canada sells it’s oil and they can’t have 75% just by demand again. They have to pay to the market price or do without.

8963 2018-10-28 18:43:24 @FoxNews interviewed a member of the invasion force this morning. A deported Honduran, unclear if convicted, at least accused of attempted murder, headed this way.
Claims he wants to enter, hire a lawyer, clear his name and obtain legal status.

8987 2018-10-28 18:40:39 A beautiful nation destroyed. Just because USA screwed up by invading Iraq (nothing to do with Sep 11) for oil, strategic Israeli security, increasing Irani influence. To control Iran,they then destroyed a secular Syria by training Salafi Jihadis against Assad with Saudi support.
8988 2018-10-28 18:40:37 Dont they commute? After the supposed gazetted 8c profit from 1 card are they going to be facing frozen prices? Are they goin to be buying their cooking oil at $3.50 as b4? At times your costs are directly affected and at times you price looking at your expenses to be met later!
8989 2018-10-28 18:40:27 You’ve heard of Essential Oil moms, now get ready for Essential Oil dad bands
8990 2018-10-28 18:40:26 Scotland could be like Norway if the oil revenue had been invested in the country from first barrel sold, in England whisky sales are overrated, one million Scots in the south of the UK, don't laugh , biggest export to England that never gets taxed is square sausage

8994 2018-10-28 18:40:19 As a Calgarian I will be paying (taxes) Municipally, Provincially and Federally and if there are cost overruns I will be paying again.  Calgarians can not afford a 2 week event at this time with our Oil industry in the toilet and by the way I am not a bot.
8995 2018-10-28 18:40:13 I marinated my hair in evoo and jojoba oil for like 2 hours yesterday (most because I hella forgot lol) but dang haven’t prepoo’d like that in a while. Gooooood shit

8998 2018-10-28 18:39:51 always on the hunt for a great face oil (especially the ones that can be mixed in with foundation)
8999 2018-10-28 18:39:34 Yeah, some Americans, mostly the NRA, are too stupid to realize you can't stop an oil fire by dumping more oil on it.
9000 2018-10-28 18:39:30 I am full of beans full of oil and anxienty.
9001 2018-10-28 18:39:24 I thought you said you were balling? Now you can't buy a return ticket
9002 2018-10-28 18:39:11 "It won't take long to get it, Keithy. Just lay down and get ready for a nice massage!"

And he's skipping away to get the massaging oil.
9003 2018-10-28 18:38:57 Wow! What a week.

No Robertson, no Arnautovic, no Hazard.

I was flying.... Now I'm crashing.

Please I'm now into oil business because I have discovered oil rocking the bottom of my leagues.

9006 2018-10-28 18:38:47 So mom am I use the same night oil from @KamaAyurveda and both of us have our own bottles. When I went to my dresser now to apply it before I sleep, I see it’s not there. I guess someone’s bottle got done with and has stolen mine. OK
9007 2018-10-28 18:38:36 y’all tryna do an oil spill pt 2 like the first one was safe
9008 2018-10-28 18:38:33 @Brilafm889 #HOWMARKET The way real madrid are going down, they will soon discover crude oil.
9009 2018-10-28 18:38:28 The Clinique dry to very dry never enhances redness for me. But I use that in the morning and at night and I apply a rose oil on top of it to lock in the moisture. It took about a week to get rid of actual dry patches though.
9010 2018-10-28 18:38:24 I let this random dude that was part of some banda hit my oil pen and I woke up without it. Fuck.

9017 2018-10-28 18:36:57 Garden eggs, groundnut , pepper, onion , palm oil
9018 2018-10-28 18:36:55 @beautybakerie y'all should consider adding a few drops of your primer oil to your foundation and concealer formulas
9019 2018-10-28 18:36:54 I wouldn't mind rubbing coconut oil for hours 
9020 2018-10-28 18:36:48 Frequently visit from time to time when I get back up der. xD however she kicked me out of bed. Because she wants to keep me. What’s it going to be my hands and feet. What am I supposed to tell Farrod when I dig up the oil from the house he’d chop my fucking hands off. xD
9021 2018-10-28 18:36:43 Thank you so much! I used to have some coconut oil and it helped a lot. I’ll get some more! I’m gonna buy some products today. You’re definitely not alone. My hair is so stubborn rn :(
9022 2018-10-28 18:36:37 Canadian oil stocks aren't the best.  However, they do present a trading opportunity... take a look at CPG, CJ, CVE. I was lucky enough to make 2
4x 25% returns on those ones.  All time low.  Again, just be careful.
9023 2018-10-28 18:36:32 You cannot pretend antisemitism is not a public health crisis. 4 students in Madison WI took down a 7+/-story bldg w/a truck full of fertilizer & heating oil
9024 2018-10-28 18:36:26 While I appreciate all of the work you've put into these lists, I only know of two successful boycotts: Nestle, when they were pushing bottle feeding on poor women and Shell Oil, when they were propping up the apartheid government in So Africa. Each took years to effect change.
9025 2018-10-28 18:36:22 If your car takes synthetic oil, use synthetic oil.
If your car takes synthetic and you tell me to use conventional, I am gonna notate the shit out of that ticket. 
I ain't buying you a new engine.

9027 2018-10-28 18:36:01 take the leftover mashed potatoes, green onion, shredded cheddar, and you mix em in a bowl. Grease up a skillet (I like 1/2 olive oil 1/2 butter) and heat on med. Place a scoop of potato mix in the skillet and shape into a pancake shape. Heat until the cheese melts, and serve!

9031 2018-10-28 18:35:32 Remind me just to make an appointment next time I need an oil change. I literally feel like

9041 2018-10-28 18:34:34 What about the salient issues of corruption; abuse of office on issuance of universities licences, allocation of oil blocs for self & cronnies etc.Dont forget OBJ was declared bankrupt ahead 1999 election but later ranked among billionaires...the same script of Atiku's wealth.

If Trump had waited 14 minutes it would have been the next day.
9047 2018-10-28 18:33:54 The oil is going to move. Billions have been invested in refinery capacity on the gulf to refine heavy crude from Canada and Venezuela. They can influence the method but they can't stop the flow.
9048 2018-10-28 18:33:44 Fareed, STOP bowing down to Saudis as the "central banker of oil".

You're selling out a free press & rule of law to murderous Muslim dictator Mohammed Bone Sawman for a toxic poison that destroys our climate.

They need to sell oil & we need to GET OFF OIL. We hold the cards.
9049 2018-10-28 18:33:41 Add some oil (olive, grapeseed, sweet almond oil etc ) to your lotion or apply it after lotion 
9050 2018-10-28 18:33:38 Indeed, the beard oil and fixed gear jokes worked because they were from somebody I assume lives in the green area having fun with the image of inner city dwelling hipsters. Those that don't work point the joke outward.

9055 2018-10-28 18:32:59 pumpkin helps to relieve constipation - you can mix it with coconut water and give it to her for hydration.  There is a gel that has calories in it - get that for the nutrition while she can't eat. hydrate, hydrate and a drop of mineral oil before the water

9058 2018-10-28 18:32:20 and when it is finally finished and it only gives Canadians a few thousand jobs as well oil and gas will not be in as high of demand, we ironically can use it to transport renewable energy water from rain shed areas to dry land farmers around AB, Sask.
9059 2018-10-28 18:32:17 When Tom Crean was at Indiana:
— he said I only came to games for the pizza in the press room 
—  he called me out for wearing an ACC lanyard
— he challenged me to take on Victor Oladipo in a dunk contest
— he set up blind taste test with Diet Coke, Diet Pepsi and motor oil
9060 2018-10-28 18:32:02 Just spent an embarrassingly long time picking out which scented oil to buy for my plug in. Spoiler alert.. I bought them all.

9065 2018-10-28 18:31:36 This is the @latimes going out of its way to find something negative to print about the President. Just another reason why more than half of the country has lost faith in mainstream media. When was the last time you reported on the use of palm oil in the United States?
9066 2018-10-28 18:31:27 Try using castor oil
9067 2018-10-28 18:31:20 what about the spills of rubber, diesel, oil in the water ?
9068 2018-10-28 18:31:08 Kevin McCarthy never had an original thought. He's just a pretty face who's been groomed by Bill Thomas to help Bakersfield-rich ag and oil interests. He fecklessly does what he's told and parrots what he hears said by his handlers.

9076 2018-10-28 18:30:42 i've only every used acrylic paint the thought of oil paints always scared me sjdhdhs but i really should've invested in them earlier bc they are so much easier to use
9077 2018-10-28 18:30:37 Remember when the deputy premier called out of work oil industry workers sewer rats? Even though there was a sharp spike in suicides amongst the out of work men in alberta.. she called them sewer rats. Her being the health minister, she knew about the suicides.
9078 2018-10-28 18:30:32 Only a mad man will believe u. Why do this government u work for want to sell assets.  Why is conspiracy & cloudy shadow still covering NNPC finance.

9083 2018-10-28 18:29:38 We are the worlds third largest oil reserves country fourth largest hydro electric! Around twenty percent of Canadian house holds are energy poor spending 10 % of income per month! That’s before you add another almost a hundred dollars a month for carbon tax in the west!
9084 2018-10-28 18:29:35 Psst fam, your club don discover oil yet? @CarloLarenzo
9085 2018-10-28 18:29:33 Thank goodness those SUV's and oil factories kicked in stopped the ice age. Sad that it killed the dinosaurs though. Wish we could control that pesky sun and put the heat where we want it.
9086 2018-10-28 18:29:25 Oh totally cure everything!  What a nutbar!  Sorry you have to deal with that crap.  Sad part is, it’s those type of people that tell individuals with cancer or other diseases that drinking coconut oil or sitting on an ant hill will cure them. Pseudo-science and Pseudo-medicine.
9087 2018-10-28 18:29:23 I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THAT OUR ANCESTORS NEVER HAD THESE PROBLEMS BECAUSE THEY TOOK CARE OF THE EARTH  NOT LIKE TODAY POLLUTING IT BY SPRAYING POISONS DRILLING FOR OIL AND OTHER THINGS WE ALL NEED TO STAND UP FOR OUR MOTHER EARTH

9090 2018-10-28 18:29:00 I got so anxious with my oldest son I drank castor oil and was sick for 2 days & it wasn’t worth it. By the time I gave birth I was crying that it was too fast anyways lol those last couple weeks are the hardest but we don’t appreciate them lol
9091 2018-10-28 18:28:57 Chicken breast, a little bit of bacon, pumpkin, carrot, some apple, cucumber, and egg. She was thinking of fish oil but last time she added some to my food, I refused it.
9092 2018-10-28 18:28:38 What a thought. Sadly I don't even have any toast....  Have quite a few vegetables though, think I will roast them with some olive oil, though I can already hear my mother saying 'where's the PROTEIN in THAT?'  (Thin have got a mozzarella somewhere..)
9093 2018-10-28 18:28:30 Basically..... the renewable  energy industry' has been in existence  for some time  now. Literally,  we make do of the fuel sessions.  I.e the crude oil for the power generation.. ie hydropower but nowadays, we are welcoming  other energy  aspects

9098 2018-10-28 18:27:47 My father used to say that to me when I would be complaining about chopping firewood. Growing up we had a proper wood furnace/boiler (versus oil or gas) and it provided all the heat and hot water. Also meant I was really good at starting a fire...
9099 2018-10-28 18:27:38 No each riding votes there are winners and losers the winners than form government PR will let parties have seats they didn't win and may represent areas of the province that have very different needs that go against the parties bottom lines that they do not support like oil &gas
9100 2018-10-28 18:27:37 More La Neige lip mask/balm, Drunk Elephant Marula oil and Philosophy Purity cleanser. Debating trying the new Clinique gel moisturizer, too.

9102 2018-10-28 18:27:34 I like using cream every once in while it has stronger scents in a lot cases & a higher concentration of oil busting lye. But hands down no contest I get better performance & satisfaction from Soap.

9104 2018-10-28 18:27:32 Peel it, grease it with palm oil..like just rub small palm oil on it, wrap it in a foil paper, and put it in an empty frying pan and prepare on slow heat..keep turning it as interval... It will take roughly 20mins.
9105 2018-10-28 18:27:28 @subaru_usa how do you suggest that I clean the tan, cloth seats in my 2011 Subaru Legacy? over the summer I got tanning oil on the seats

9120 2018-10-28 18:25:39  I’ll sit it on the altar for you. Right next to the oil.
9121 2018-10-28 18:25:30 Unfortunately, most of the world's oil is produced by countries where democracy doesn't exist, or dictatorships. Saudi Arabia's budget (for example) is almost completely based on oil revenues. Demand isn't dropping, but (cheap) supply is.

9129 2018-10-28 18:24:20 #ISIL reoccupy control over Achilles of Deiralzor's largest oil field by attacking democratic #Syria forces
9130 2018-10-28 18:24:10 It’s not what you think it is the castor oil doesn’t leave that feeling in a good oil cleanser also going over it with witch hazel or a toner should keep it balanced
9131 2018-10-28 18:24:09 Establish an oil payment clearinghouse with limit to the country's needs that can only be used to make food and medicine purchases
9132 2018-10-28 18:23:46 I'd rank PUFA-rich seed oil as high as sugar in terms of harm to health. The hazards of these chemically unstable, highly inflammatory oils need more exposure and attention. The AHA, for example, still recommends these over healthy saturated fats such as tallow and butter.
9133 2018-10-28 18:23:44 Gambled match... Subbing bellerin and oil before 65min of play and leaving persons like laca and iwobi was wrong for me. At least laca or iwobi would have made way for Ramsey
9134 2018-10-28 18:23:07 Of course it's me ...why would I put a pic up of someone else lol
9135 2018-10-28 18:23:01 The solution may be an oil filled electric radiator. They seem to work pretty well, without being ridiculously expensive to run.
9136 2018-10-28 18:22:54 5. You can listen to the lies Big Oil is telling you, or you can vote #Yes1631 for a clean energy future. We build that future by making the investments we need. It's not going to happen magically. It's going to happen because we decided to make it so!
9137 2018-10-28 18:22:52 Not riding tho. I, stupidly, decided to see what I could use castor oil for other than my hair. Always heard that people take it for good immune systems, so it sounded good to me. LIES. LIES. LIES. It's a laxative and it worked allllllll night. lol
9138 2018-10-28 18:22:50 What happe to palm oil 
9139 2018-10-28 18:22:27 Castor oil !
9140 2018-10-28 18:22:27 In my analysis, what happens is that oil at Big Hill is held by US as custodian while Saudi funds buy & sell (repo) oil economic interest in exchange for a reverse repo of Treasuries. This opaque Enron-style prepay creates #DarkInventory & a two tier physical oil #FakeMarket
9141 2018-10-28 18:22:26 hey, in case a person who cares for cars hasn’t told you, it’s getting cold. check your tire air pressure and your fluids like windshield wiper fluid, oil and coolant. check your tires aren’t bald. don’t get stuck in the snow bc you were didn’t feel like spending a couple bucks
9142 2018-10-28 18:22:24 It is a nice day for a ride.
I meet a lady trapped under a dead horse, and give her a ride to another town. Then I buy some gun oil (got to keep those guns clean!), and take the stagecoach back to Valentine.

Have I moved the plot on one iota? Nope. Lovely evening's gaming though
9143 2018-10-28 18:22:03 is it you then ?
perhaps it is me.
9144 2018-10-28 18:21:52 Girl, I get a full oil change, tire rotation, and a car wash for $49 including tax.
9145 2018-10-28 18:21:35 4. Think about how much of your household income today goes to Big Oil to perpetuate an economy that is based on fossil fuel use. The creation and use of fossil fuels releases toxic pollutants. Don't you want a state with less asthma and heart disease and cancer?
9146 2018-10-28 18:21:28 It would be better if it was you
9147 2018-10-28 18:21:26 I know I ain’t an oil@painting but he is horrible
9148 2018-10-28 18:21:21 maybe I misread your earlier tweet.

"we" was to imply that you and I both acknowledge the Oil Dependency.

"oil dependency is still there due to..."

(I read this line to mean you acknowledge the dependency, but link it to bad decision making)

9159 2018-10-28 18:19:57 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
9160 2018-10-28 18:19:57 @deliciousmag I want to make the rice and leek dish from Anna Del Conte in this months mag - But I'm sure there needs to be more liquid in there! How can risotto rice cook in a couple of eggs and 150ml of oil?!?

No, I'm good thanks
9168 2018-10-28 18:18:32 How about Oil? I’m very interested to know what kind of volume of Oil in Canada is being shipped by Rail.
9169 2018-10-28 18:18:28 So, that's why I am inquiring about this with the GV office..   
PMJT is clearly serving the Bank, and the future security of the Oil Industry.. Which loves our massive crude oil.
The People tell he Clean air, renewable energy is needed. and the IPCC.
9170 2018-10-28 18:18:24 Completely agree. Super unhelpful and reinforcing the impression of self-righteousness vs passion and love for Wpg. (Full disclosure, the beard oil/fixed gear one was hiliarious because it was self-deprecating vs asshatty
9171 2018-10-28 18:18:21 I have one month to do a full 5ft x 4ft oil painting.

9186 2018-10-28 18:16:24 I understand your confusion. Who is this 'we' in first place? Even the Rockefeller family has been exiting the oil business after almost 150 yrs in it. Clarify this for yourself, do a research on decarbonisation (G7 took the decision in 2015) & then we'll talk on oil dependency.
9187 2018-10-28 18:15:59 I agree with the general thinking that Water Crises will be a problem.
(Mostly for non-Developed Economies)

Point of Divergence:
When people say Water is the Next Oil, I don't think they understand the role of Oil (past, current, & likely future) in shaping world order.

9206 2018-10-28 18:14:10 So you think all of our ancestors had mental issues? And also you think vegans dont eat any protein? Protein is a part of every calorie, every single consumable food has protein in it, even oil has the smallest ammount of protein and carbs.
9207 2018-10-28 18:13:43 What's up with that 10 Trillion dollar MBS empire, why would he risk it all for a journalist? Who's buying their oil, who wants Iranian oil and gas, who have interests in seeing MBS replaced, the Europeans, the British, the USA, Turkey, Russia, China, Trump?

9220 2018-10-28 18:11:31 a bit of vegetable oil would help
9221 2018-10-28 18:11:31 I love oil paints so much but I mostly see digital art and I want some inspiration :( I love and appreciate digital art and stuff so much but I just want to see more oil paint stuff right now since that’s what I’m working on for class,,,
9222 2018-10-28 18:11:23 The only thing that’s helped is that I do oil cleansing but my skin is combination so idk if that makes a difference
9223 2018-10-28 18:11:10 It’s probably more directed at people who protest pipelines and don’t see the correlation to oil and gas to their world.  The hypocrisy is great amongst some sectors of the population.
9224 2018-10-28 18:11:05 I've found @consciousface that use organic ingredients and aluminium packaging too, with varied skin-type coverages. Eager to try them once I've finished my current products. I find coconut oil too oily for my skin personally, Etsy has been a good source for me so far
9225 2018-10-28 18:10:51 Ba chill
9226 2018-10-28 18:10:49 A guy I know in CA said he’ll never support the oil field. Lmao you support the oil field daily buddy.
9227 2018-10-28 18:10:48 I have a sudden obsession with coconut oil now 
9228 2018-10-28 18:10:41 Unfortunately this is in some ways "our chickens coming home to roost", as US has f*ed around in Central & South America for years in past. Our  stupid drug war, supporting dictators & rebels, assassinations,  &  corporatism over oil / rubber etc. 
9229 2018-10-28 18:10:36 overlooked here, or silenced here, is that causes we talk (or not) about are inseparable from neo-liberal policies AND presidents that sacrificed welfare of populations for benefit of their plutocrats, zionist, pentagon, oil industry masters. in that, trump is a side effect
9230 2018-10-28 18:10:33 If you're interested in trying a CBD oil, we'd love to help you! There are tons of benefits. Let us know if you have any questions 
9231 2018-10-28 18:10:28 I need to get my oil changed & stop putting it off

9233 2018-10-28 18:10:05 US Shale Oil Industry: Catastrophic Failure Ahead
 
As the shale industry goes from 30 to 60 to 70 stage frack wells, this takes one hell of a lot more pipe, water, sand, fracking chemicals and of course, money...
9234 2018-10-28 18:10:04 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
9235 2018-10-28 18:10:01 How is it more valuable than oil?!? Honestly Vice, you need new writers stat.
9236 2018-10-28 18:09:41 The same revolution need to bring in oil. India import USD 70 billion oil every year. If India manage to use local resources & bring almost all transport system on electric, we will save this amount every year.This one revolution can place the country among very few rich nations.
9237 2018-10-28 18:09:34 Peppermint oil
9238 2018-10-28 18:09:27 Scott Adams the chief snake oil salesman
9239 2018-10-28 18:09:12 peppermint oil > excedrin migraine or any other
9240 2018-10-28 18:09:08 Chicken Oil > KFC Gravy 
9241 2018-10-28 18:08:30 Yeah Paul, G.W. Bush (Pentagon), Dick Cheney (Halliburton), Donald Rumsfeld (NATO), Benjamin (sic) Netanyahu, and Tony Blair did 9/11. USA does not care who sits on the oil, but when the people take it back, USA will attack them, thus destroying another nation. I've had enough.
9242 2018-10-28 18:08:23 People Deceiving people
Political Displaced People

LOOT is in their DNA

If they can do this to themselves, imagine what they'll do to Nigeria foreign reserve not to talk of oil
9243 2018-10-28 18:08:22 MBS gat lots of money to give away as he seeks to diversify his nation from oil

He has invested in Uber, & is the biggest donor for tech startups in US silicon valley

The world have to choose between ethics & slush investment donations.

If they don't, it is same as blood money
9244 2018-10-28 18:08:13 Feel better soon! Recommend oil of oregano for the sore throat and to fight infection.
9245 2018-10-28 18:08:13 I’m obsessed with coconut oil. Oakley had really bad dry skin on his face. Coconut oil... face totally clear! A little cradle cap... coconut oil! Much better!!! So you have questions about what to use on your kid? My answer- COCONUT OIL!!!!
9246 2018-10-28 18:08:12 The many mixes and pauses in my current recipe make it bubbly; the olive oil makes it smooth.  That's my current.
But you know.
Every day is a winding road.
9247 2018-10-28 18:08:05 be like palm oil stew..
9248 2018-10-28 18:07:57 we like to grille them basted with a bit of seasoned olive oil.
9249 2018-10-28 18:07:52 I wanna do acrylic and oil paints too. But. Spaces. And equipments cost so much i die
9250 2018-10-28 18:07:48 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. 

Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
9251 2018-10-28 18:07:37 Omg, you know like I had ONE drop of that oil and I was high as a fucking kite all last night ? I told my dad to take one cos it’s proper strong and he told me he’s took THREE DROPS lmfaoooooo that’s Ian the magic dragon gone for the night. IM SCREAMING 
9252 2018-10-28 18:07:27 Palm oil or groundnut oil stew ?
9253 2018-10-28 18:07:27 Why i read this as telonin. You need telon oil baby?
9254 2018-10-28 18:07:26 So your profile picture isnt meant to be cool ? Bar-locks.
9255 2018-10-28 18:07:19 to be fair, that's when it was fashionable to invade middle eastern countries for oil in the name of "defending democracy"
9256 2018-10-28 18:07:04 Ah yes, I'll take a double shot of diesel oil please.
9257 2018-10-28 18:07:02 @realDonaldTrump I am a Republican fan, but I disagree with you, and I believe that you have been weak in sanctions, it is not just a boycott of oil, you have worked poorly in other sectors, and I'm not satisfied.
9258 2018-10-28 18:06:58 parmesan is so good in eggs because it's dry, no extra oil in it
9259 2018-10-28 18:06:58 Guns,beef and oil... what more do you need?
9260 2018-10-28 18:06:55 Kenshi can be such a stupid fucking game at times

Spawns me in the middle of a oil field, so I die almost instantly
9261 2018-10-28 18:06:32 Have you the same feelings about oil wells, coal mining, nuclear power and others as you have fracking. Or are you just anti fracking? In the U.K.  it’s relatively new to us and I can’t have an informed opinion because of this.
9262 2018-10-28 18:06:32 Munhu anongoti right now, right now haaparidze shoko raMwari. I won't even go to the  so called anointing oil, wrist bands, etc
9263 2018-10-28 18:06:25 Gov. Abbott went against obama who tried to confiscate Texas ranchers’ LANDS

Gov. Abbott went against obama who did not want Texas OIL business
9264 2018-10-28 18:06:15 Why are oil changes sooo expensive 
9265 2018-10-28 18:06:08 It's the best way to release their flavor. Lightly flash fry them and they open up a ton! The focaccia I'm baking is drizzled in olive oil and baked in a hot oven so it somewhat mimics the effect. Nom nom nom.
9266 2018-10-28 18:06:01 Have you tried octopus with olive oil and vinegar?? And octopus in red sauce with rice?
9267 2018-10-28 18:05:54 Baby oil is already on

I’m confused.

Q: How can Big Oil be a “Dead Horse” if we acknowledge Oil Dependency continues?

9275 2018-10-28 18:05:18 I've tried lots of them.  Current one is:
a cup of flour, a cup of water, a tablespoon wait, wait 45 minutes.
a cup and a half of flour, a tablespoon salt, wait 45 minutes.
5 cups of flour, a quarter cup olive oil, dough hook for 5 minutes, then rise 2 hours.
9276 2018-10-28 18:05:11 If u don’t put on baby oil like i thought u keep it
9277 2018-10-28 18:05:02 no I think it is what it is heid..I don't do things to be "cool" or to be liked..I'm not 10.
9278 2018-10-28 18:04:51 That’s how much most oil changes are. 100-120 most of the time if u go to professionals.

9289 2018-10-28 18:03:37 Wow and they call us snowflakes. Maybe they feel bullied because encouraging the distribution of assault weapons, massive tax cuts for the wealthiest in our nation, removing healthcare as a universal right and auctioning off public land to oil campaniles are all unpopular ideas

9292 2018-10-28 18:02:55 Sooo . . . You're comparing Trump to Lincoln. Perhaps the circumstances are similar; but the personages involved? I think not. I'm sure Trump is ecstatic about the comparison tho. It's like comparing a snake oil salesman to Winston Churchill.
9293 2018-10-28 18:02:53 I swear we are deeply at sleep
9294 2018-10-28 18:02:50 Not everyone was interested in oil.....so I think this is a way to get evry1 healed bcz this is strictly medical.....

9312 2018-10-28 18:00:09 The TAX is really all about consumers bearing the cost of GHG output so that we can, morally at least, be comfortable being in the oil business. Aside from the fact that the Tax will do NOTHING to change temps, climate etc. we all need to get good with being a big energy exporter

Everything I feared he'd do to our country has come to pass, from his anti-science (pro-Big-Oil) contribution to climate change, to his mainstreaming of white supremacists, to his lifting up oligarchs.

9365 2018-10-28 17:54:04 I’ve read it several times. It clearly states that “the reentry of an oil or gas well previously plugged or abandoned is considered new oil and gas development.” I don’t think this was intentional, but it’s a huge oversight that will have serious consequences

9367 2018-10-28 17:53:35 That makes a lot of sense re: Tramadol & Gabapentin. They both relieve nerve pain, but via different routes. In case you don't already know, taking Gabapentin with a high-fat meal (even a salad w/olive oil dressing will do) increases the amount of Gabapentin absorbed 
9368 2018-10-28 17:53:30 In case you hadn’t notice the offshore oil industry has been in a major slump since 2014. Better hire really cheap labour than guys on the dole  #GreedyBastards
9369 2018-10-28 17:53:23 You’re a hopeless person! The Lunatic sits in the WH and is pouring Oil into the Fire and don’t see how much he divides the Nation which slowly recognize that the Evil in person has captured the Nation and holds her Hostage! You’re a very sick Toxic Person! #TrumpsAmerikkka

Forcing food will complicate a blockage. Too late for food. An animal is suffering and will die quickly! Vet Now
9372 2018-10-28 17:53:12 If only our government had enough sense.. DUBAI developed from becoming a hub apart from its oil. It was just a stop over point to connect to Asia. See where it is now. Imagine Lagos becoming a hub. And improve beaches and shopping and etc etc we are a loooong long way away. Sad

9383 2018-10-28 17:51:34 They have a huge sense of entitlement and hypocrisy. Whine about socialism while they live on our dime.

And I guarantee you that once they're done with politics, they'll have plump appointments on an oil company's board of directors waiting for them.

9408 2018-10-28 17:48:34 Correct. But we can take steps to the future where we won't be consuming as much oil as we are. In any case, I doubt that you will be interested in this future as you don't seem to be interested in consequences.
9409 2018-10-28 17:48:23 I'm standing my somewhere running street basketball commentary. This girl hugs me from nowhere and whispers

Hi,
I have ordered a Indulekha bringha selfie bottle hair oil. 100 ml each of pack 3.
The product is not original. It is red colour oil. The original Indulekha oil is dark brown.
This is not expected from the brand like snapdeal.
9415 2018-10-28 17:47:31 
9416 2018-10-28 17:47:26 The original reason I started being a sceptic was because I knew governments would never do what was supposedly required to "stop global warming" - I started trying to work out how much warming would occur if we burnt all the oil 1/2
9417 2018-10-28 17:47:20 That’s from yet another excellent Midnight  Oil album.

Been meaning to check out Red Sails in the sunset  and others but just haven’t gotten around to it.

9419 2018-10-28 17:46:48 @Ritzcrackers Every 25 seconds a football pitch of forest is lost in Indonesia - and Indigenous People, orangutans and the climate are losing out. Stop buying dirty palm oil and exploiting our planet.

9448 2018-10-28 17:44:15 I have punctured his lies.
He claimed that oil sold $100-$114 from 2010-2014. That is is a pure lie. Oil sold as low as $68 in 2014.
The oil price was fluctuating, that was why they asked Buhari he said he will stabilize it.
He also lumped state debt under Gej.

9452 2018-10-28 17:43:53 I think that may be something she is incapable of understanding.  Historical relevance and applying that knowledge is not something she sees as part of her job.  Making up statements that protect her snake oil salesman boss and blind worship seem to be her only goal!
9453 2018-10-28 17:43:49 This will mean increased energy costs for working families. You will see substantial increases for gas, electrical and natural gas. Many folks can't afford to live in the city they work in and have no local metro. Big oil will pass costs to us. VOTE NO!

9471 2018-10-28 17:41:35 I want to know if all palm oil products in products like halloween candy or expensive margerines mean deforestation of rainforest and loss of oragutan habitat.  Is there a sustainable palm oil industry?

9511 2018-10-28 17:37:42 Unrealized unmined potential? Our "theoretical" oil is selling for $50 a barrel less than market price right now, a daily loss of millions of dollars.
9512 2018-10-28 17:37:40 I'm confuse, wasn't the chocolate already vegan? Like the oreos? I don't know but it was vegetal oil, cocoa and sugar no? Plis tell me if I'm wrong, it's a genuine question
9513 2018-10-28 17:37:37 Trump’s true “base” is his donor class. The Mercer, Prince, Koch,  and Thiel interests, e.g., are pleased to impose surveillance capitalism, private armies, and ongoing oil dependency on the world, keeping whites to the cooler north and as many people of color as possible out.

9525 2018-10-28 17:36:05 Worst case scenario is that we give credence to people like Peter Sutherland and his #Islamophobia ideas. Iran wants to export oil but tks to US and Israel, they are restricted in doing so. #howconservativesthink #cdnpoli

9530 2018-10-28 17:34:59 Slanders refuses to hear the Nazi sentiment echoing in 45’s rhetoric or the similarities in those he hates. His love for Israel is strategic hoping to get a foothold into Middle East Muslim oil. Wishing Barron might marry into oil rich Muslim royal family?

9534 2018-10-28 17:34:34 so i lost my cbd oil and my charger for my wax pen, i guess the universe wants me to have anxiety
9535 2018-10-28 17:34:26 Dude it's way better than pills. If it's for pain, there is no high for cbd. As far as anxiety and sleeping, it works. Go vape pen of oil. Edibles don't work on everyone, so only buy a couple and see if it works.

9540 2018-10-28 17:33:11 How is western support for Saudi in Yemen not blatant neocolonialism? There's no reason for it other than oil and hegemony. The US/UK are so entrenched in it that they'd rather sacrifice the life of a @washingtonpost journalist in silence than give up their piece of the pie.

Most of these remain Oil Dependent.

9562 2018-10-28 17:30:57 Why doesn't Robert start his productive career with a job. Like: Oil refinery; or railroad; or steel mill; or airline; or shipyard; or construction company; or fire fighter; or house painter; or auto production line; or landscaper; or taxi driver. Don't start in government.
9563 2018-10-28 17:30:48 It's going t be a very long time before the world stops using oil. It's less than18% of oil is used for fuel, There are over 6000 everyday items that use oil in there manufacturing. So for as long as the world uses oil then Scotland should benefit. But I do agree with your view

9571 2018-10-28 17:30:09 It's called a flare and it is burned rather than just releasing the gas.  The gas is a byproduct of drilling for oil so it was never meant to have a pipeline of it's own.  You are not a very good 'reporter' but you are a good 'storyteller'!  Gee I wonder who you 'report' to..duh!

9573 2018-10-28 17:30:07 Modern oil and gas extraction no longer involves just a well, pump, and tank. The process can be so overwhelmingly complex that in lieu of taking a tour in person, it helps to explore each stage through photos.

9639 2018-10-28 17:21:48 Females can do that off the strength and it’s oil. But I’ll definitely be near our tailgates and class of 2013’s
9640 2018-10-28 17:21:39 Agree that Water Tech is a hot space b/c many Oil Wealthy Countries are Water Poor and Food Poor.

Will there be Wars, Civil Wars & Social Unrest due to Water Problems?  
Yes.

Will some of these be US allies?
Probably.

But which Advanced Economy has a Water Crisis looming?

9648 2018-10-28 17:20:47 Wow. It makes me very hungry. Super tongue-in-chic, but it looks like delicious palate fun.  A monster meal. Pork barbecue gives us the whole hog and we can bite like a Muenster, and Olive Oil need not summon Popeye the sailor for rescue from the spinach. #sundayblogshare

9655 2018-10-28 17:20:24 You obviously didn't suffer under Thatcher's disastrous rule like many did.  Coal and steel industries destroyed, utilities and oil sold off, country plunged into debt and regressive poll tax imposed on poor while tax breaks given to rich.

9676 2018-10-28 17:18:04 Trump’s loyalty to the cancer of racism is astounding. Equally amazing is his appointments’ loyalty to their former employers, oil companies. How about some loyalty to humanity and the planet for a change.

9685 2018-10-28 17:16:23 What I am learning from #SaltFatAcidHeat is that I don't use nearly enough. 

Of whatever: oil, salt, vinegar, spices... I'm too timid. Because I'm afraid of overdoing it, so the food ends up not tasting as good.
9686 2018-10-28 17:16:14 i take cod liver oil for my joints and someone gave me a great tip of keeping them in the freezer so they go down quicker. also a multivitamin and a probiotic
9687 2018-10-28 17:16:11 From what I’ve found eucalyptus, peppermint, lavender, and citrus oils can have benefits when put into bong water as long as you trust the pureness of the oil.
9688 2018-10-28 17:16:08 What a theory. Stip all imports oil gas medicines raw materials, increase load shedding, stop trains for industries & masses; you will achieve surplus dear. Eco nose dive and you are justifying it dude ?

9690 2018-10-28 17:16:00 The @TexasTribune partnered with the Center for Public Integrity (CPI) to publish an exceedingly ONE-SIDED and FALSE report about how oil exports “harm Texas communities”. CPI is backed by a slew of environmentalist organizations who strongly oppose fossil fuels.

9710 2018-10-28 17:13:44 Making sure its 100% pure eucalyptus oil... it's not bad. It was traditionally smoked/steamed (and then inhaled) for chest congestion. I dk that I'd do it with other oils though....
9711 2018-10-28 17:13:44 Hahaha i never tried it! I did however eat tons of pineapple, took primrose oil pills, and I’ll admit I drank a little castor oil and bam I had my son a few days later. Who knows which one actually started the contractions though.

9786 2018-10-28 17:05:35 We can help, Claudia! For best results, be sure to shake really well and hold the bottle 12"-18" away from your face. If you still notice spots, pat gently with a damp Beauty Blender before it dries. You can also try using prior to makeup for amazing oil control. Let us know!
9787 2018-10-28 17:05:13 @BshpMerton  No matter what it looks like, God is working things for your good. The OIL is FLOWING. The resources you need are within your grasp.  God is your SOURCE! TRUST Him and OBEY!  #TruthRevealed #TRIMNation

9792 2018-10-28 17:04:57 You are saying the undiluted truth, our SAN. Since PMB refuses looting and corruption in any other nature, the fellow becomes an enemy to most Nigerians who can't live without living beyond their earnings i. e. Carrying out illegal oil bunkering activities, looting public funds..

9802 2018-10-28 17:03:36 There is nothing to investigate. Saudis admitted to be brutal murderers of the journalist they don't like. Now US government has to polish the turd before they can proceed with the arms sale. Same old BS. Dealing with horrible regime because we need their oil. Shameless.

9804 2018-10-28 17:03:34 Oil has to be traded in $.  If a country tries to circumvent that, the navy and air force have a visit.

9806 2018-10-28 17:03:30 The current oil production stays as it is, no jobs lost. The oil in AG is crap, can't even use it for roads so we're  protecting the environment to make it habitable for people to live here. Do yourself a favor & turn off Fox news & read the Measure before you pontificate further
9807 2018-10-28 17:03:27 The NYT reported "... skeptics who assume #CBD is just 21st-century snake oil may be surprised to learn that the substance is being studied as a potential treatment for maladies as diverse as schizophrenia, insomnia and cancer." But then, so was Electric Shock Therapy.
9808 2018-10-28 17:03:24 And let's not not forget, Ukraine is suffering from the Russian invasion of Donbas and Crimea, which has generated the largest refugee crisis in Europe since WW2. Likewise, the Russian aggression has deprived Ukraine of income from Donbas and Crimea, incl. oil and gas.

9854 2018-10-28 16:57:55 The USA created Venezuela mark 1trying to control its oil, and they won't like a Labour gov that would end the cons sell off of our country so you may have a point
9855 2018-10-28 16:57:22 That's the point. Make the consumer turn away from ev. VW is as disingenuous as big oil. #TESLA will have to go it alone for now. I don't mind $TSLA
9856 2018-10-28 16:57:16 Pollution from oil and gas development, toxic runoff, and miles and miles of plastic trash foul the waters and threaten marine life.
9857 2018-10-28 16:57:14 Yeah, oil prices rises but how many vessels do we have unsold. As at the last info, about our five vessels are still on waiting list in the market.
Excy things have changed.

9931 2018-10-28 16:48:07 I've just prepared carrots for tonight's roast chicken dinner. Funnily enough, I prefer them raw as well. Boiled carrots are a.m bit tasteless. Sticking them in the oven with some olive oil is better, but I can't convince my family.

9933 2018-10-28 16:47:42 In my kitchen, there's only one option: #crushed #oliveoil! The process  of crushing the ingredients into the oil protects the #nutritional integrity and also gives a richer, more intense #flavor. #Vervana #CookingAtHome #InMyKitchen

9937 2018-10-28 16:46:36 Are you kidding me?  I guess then “indoctrination” is recognized across the board?  Or is the church different?
9938 2018-10-28 16:46:33 I read that some large plantations are installing solar power to reduce their “wood” requirements. Some also grow their own trees. As solar costs/MW reduce, that’s an option to fuel oil
9939 2018-10-28 16:46:30 What do you do when your oil gets confused by your character?? Hmmmmm... @JeanellMcIver1

9944 2018-10-28 16:46:08 When it comes to choosing the healthiest flavored olive oil though, things get slightly more complicated. #Coldpressed #California olive oils are better than other varieties, but it's also important to understand  how the flavor is actually added to the oil. #OliveOil #Health

9946 2018-10-28 16:46:02 Look beyond the rhetoric & emotion. The situation in Korea is the same as it has been. US oil production has been increasing for years. The economy & unemployment don’t change dramatically fast, we are experiencing results due to business choices made by companies long ago.
9947 2018-10-28 16:45:50 @larryelder you are clearly not part of the problem you are are the problem. The broken systematic rhetoric you spill is like oil in a lake doesn't belong. Clean up your mess.

9952 2018-10-28 16:45:21 Let me follow @cathmckenna's logic--if this is true then people Montreal and Victoria should get less than Calgary because they dump raw sewage in their water. Or is it just the AB oil industry that's under her spotlight?

9963 2018-10-28 16:42:53 I understand that. Which is why I advocate returning it to places we extract. Actually less toxic than coal / oil!
9964 2018-10-28 16:42:38 I smell like black culture and tea tree oil.
9965 2018-10-28 16:42:34 How about using Canadian oil in the east instead of Saudi oil you not wit!?
9966 2018-10-28 16:41:57 Aku pake bio oil ngerasa perubahannya sebulan kemudian, aku pake bener2 pagi malem setetes 2tetes udah cukup
9967 2018-10-28 16:41:52 I got up made the bed put coolant in my car and turned my oil light off that's been on for 577544 months (yes my oil has been changed they just didn't turn it off)
9968 2018-10-28 16:41:51 the stain is sooo real. i find that a bit of baby oil nd water on a cotton pad rly helps tho !!
9969 2018-10-28 16:41:46 Today a gentleman asked me to update him on the connection between the Mafia and rising cooking oil prices.
9970 2018-10-28 16:41:40 More like oil meet water.

9973 2018-10-28 16:41:19 temporary relief doesn't seem correct. The part of package deal of 3 billion oil in deferred payments is for three years and that basically means a huge reduction in Pakistan's import bill so it has long term consequences as well. Also Chinese package is coming next !
9974 2018-10-28 16:41:16 Trump asks the oil and other environmentally climate denying and air quality polluters which regulations to rescind and how they can suggest more industry friendly nonregs.He goes and asks them!!!!And they gleefully tell him.
9975 2018-10-28 16:41:04 Just realized there's Jamaican castor oil home so I int buying. Wish I saw this earlier
9976 2018-10-28 16:41:00 Oil is a world product, not something we will be able to hoard for ourselves. You don't need to run out of oil before it has devastating economic consequences...it becomes too expensive. The arguments made were from people within the industry. I have not been convinced otherwise.

9983 2018-10-28 16:40:07 With your father as president they better oil the flagpole.
9984 2018-10-28 16:40:07 君を笑わせるためなら、僕は尻から油を出すよ。
9985 2018-10-28 16:39:58 Massa I want soup oh the oil plenty too much
9986 2018-10-28 16:39:53 If crude oil price or exchange rate increase from a "no subsidy level", then the cost of fuel will increase and the subsidy returns except local fuel price is also increased to cover the additional cost. The only way to truly remove subsidy is to let market forces...
9987 2018-10-28 16:39:47 That makes sense, I’ve never tried that! Better than wasting a whole pod of oil haha
9988 2018-10-28 16:39:35 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the publisher of the National Enquirer. It has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news.
9989 2018-10-28 16:39:32 As a vice-president I had enough authority to affect the oil and petroleum products export prices. Thus, I set up an Energo Inpex company in Geneva to import «Rosneft» goods at lower costs. The difference in purchase and market prices was a source of my enormous profits.
9990 2018-10-28 16:39:30 If you get that fancy peanut butter where the oil separates from the rest of it and it's really dry at the bottom because you already drank the oil on top do you just add water to get it right
9991 2018-10-28 16:39:11 Russia have the biggest natural gas reservoir so they don't need to burn oil to produce energy, however Saudi Arabia produce energy and electricity by the use of oil, so in the future you will see these numbers decreasing because the vision in the future is to replace the oil.

9996 2018-10-28 16:38:59 “Your circumstance is your position of opportunity; and you cannot meet it without your lamp stand (anointing from God).....YOU NEED FRESH OIL FOR THIS NEW OPPORTUNITY” @Pastor_Phillips #religion #relationship
9997 2018-10-28 16:38:57 Yes! 
9998 2018-10-28 16:38:56 It amazes me how many Canadians are so against our own oil industry. It's clear to me how few of the protesters truly understand how the oil sands work. It's much easier to buy into propaganda.
9999 2018-10-28 16:38:56 People their girls are always dirty and cook with only oil and pepper are opening mouth to talk about our girls. 
Because our broke guys can marry their girls 
But only their rich guys can even look at our girls. 
When we spend money on our sisters, keep up with the standard. 
10000 2018-10-28 16:38:52 Coz Saudi Arabia has only oil for all power supply.
Other countries have many sources such as nuclear  power .
10001 2018-10-28 16:38:51 Hmm... so when Brian et al say "The English steal our oil revenue" they really mean that all the people of England actually do, literally, steal Scotland's oil revenue? I didn't know they were collectively responsible for taxation policy or, indeed, theft.

10004 2018-10-28 16:38:04 500g flour
21g yeast
2 tsp salt
300 ml water
3 tbsp olive oil
1 egg yolk

Make a dough with the flour, yeast, salt, water and 1.5 tbsp of the olive oil.
Let rise for ~1h
Knead the dough & form a flat bread on a tray dusted with flour or farina. Let rise another 30 min.
10005 2018-10-28 16:38:04 NY times recipes be like “step 2: heat oil on medium, add onion and bell pepper, cook until very soft but not too soft, add whole garlic clove for 5.5 sec then take it off heat and set aside, flambay whole snapper in separate pan, make roux, slowly stir in excess tomato water...”
10006 2018-10-28 16:38:03 Does anyone know if CBD oil works for insomnia ?
10007 2018-10-28 16:37:57 Every love is for a reason. It being true is you knowing that that is what you truly want and craving it every single second.
10008 2018-10-28 16:37:47 Nice! Thank you for supporting @HarleyRouda. We really need to get rid of greedy Rohrabacher before he permits to off-shore drilling and collects his handouts from the oil/gas industries. #ProtectOurCoasts

10015 2018-10-28 16:37:08 guess so ;-)
even though that was written for me I adapt it. I always add wine in the bottom of the roasting dish, and shove slivers of garlic into the skin.
Oh bum, forgot the olive oil on the top. Wonder if it will make a difference
10016 2018-10-28 16:36:59 Slavery, Ivory, Whale meat/oil. Though probably slavery as I'm not sure consumption of the latter two have really stopped? And perhaps more for economic reasons

Time for You & Elon to start up the first honest News show for the people??
10018 2018-10-28 16:36:37 Well, was it about oil? Dealers who control trafficking, our economy, foreign interests, etc?
10019 2018-10-28 16:36:34 Who sold Russia uranium ?  Who gave Iran billions with no inspection terms. Who spies in all of us? When caught he used UK and Aussies to continue spying?

10023 2018-10-28 16:36:14 Sorry, I will only offer a summary example. The amount of subsidy per litre depends mainly on price of crude oil, exchange rate and local fuel price. If I fix price at say N145 per litre today and eliminate the subsidy, if crude price increases tomorrow, the subsidy comes back.

10031 2018-10-28 16:35:01 Vitamin D is a good one for energy and bone health. Fish oil is good too, but I just read you should only take iron if you've had blood tests, because it's easy to take too much
10032 2018-10-28 16:34:33 Hillary told us what would happen if Trump was elected, she won the popular vote by more than 3 million votes.  Trump sold America "Snake Oil", received RUSSIAN ASSISTANCE, maybe even Saudi Assistance too won the Electoral College and is the President. What is wrong with this?
10033 2018-10-28 16:34:31 You can't slick a can of oil it's already slick
10034 2018-10-28 16:34:28 A ha! Thank you. Wondered what the heck I'd need 3 litres of oil for. D's celebrating at school in the week so I'd have known that later in the week
