5 2018-04-03 23:59:08 While still selling above MSRP, $NVDA and $AMD GPUs are now regularly in stock at $AMZN because the crypto mining rush is dying. We anticipate 2018 outlook will begin to revert to the mean, along with price multiples.
6 2018-04-03 23:58:39 It’s incredible how undervalued this company is. A read through their progress so far proves it. They may not have been great with communications but I for one am glad of that. It’s kept the price down for long enough to get a decent position. Best kept secret in crypto.

41 2018-04-03 23:57:04 maybe start their own crypto currency, the bluntcoin or the doobie dollar ;)

54 2018-04-03 23:55:33 Absurd. Time for a @mailchimp competitor to fill in the gap? And perhaps accept payment in crypto?  Huge opportunity.
55 2018-04-03 23:55:18 I did pretty well in crypto today! Yay almost back to even.
56 2018-04-03 23:55:09 100% agreed. And hopefully we will see that sometime soon, not in 2 years though. hopefully with a totally anonymous ledger. But I think immutability is far more important (especially to the public) than Byzantine tolerance, when you can just wait a few blocks. In 5 years btc...

58 2018-04-03 23:55:08 Why are you still doing interviews on unchained? Thought you had moved to unconfirmed. was looking for a latest podcast on unconfirmed but its on unchained.
59 2018-04-03 23:55:05 What software or exchanges are you using to trade? I've been day trading fx for a decade (mostly on MT4) and am looking to get into day trading crypto. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated!
60 2018-04-03 23:54:52 I think it's a smart move especially if I can use my crypto to purchase beach front mansion property. 
61 2018-04-03 23:54:30 フリーランスになろうよおじさん、って話題になってるけど、大学出てすぐフリーになった身としては、ちょっと複雑かなあ。

大学の時の会社の社長、今はかなり成功して有名だけど、僕が迷ってたときにその人が「ま、なんとかなるものだよ」って言ってくれたからフリーになれた。そんなものかな、と。

63 2018-04-03 23:54:05 My local bank charged me ~ $200 for an international transaction 

My first experience with #Bitcoins: 

- Read @julianhosp book
- Transaction in minutes
- Totally transparent
- Fast Sale

Banks should update their strategy or #Crypto will kick their asses soon #UserExperience
64 2018-04-03 23:54:01 I was birthed into the crypto sphere the start of Jan.  My first buy was 3 KUshares at $20 USD each and a wee sack of $DBC at .70.   It could have been worse.  I cost averaged the last 3 months and lost only 2/5th my portfolio value while losing 80 percent in Jan buys. Still here

89 2018-04-03 23:50:38 A random observation, the number of blockchain and crypto related meetups in LA are inversely proportional to the bitcoin price.
90 2018-04-03 23:50:32 Common Barry your the Rothschild of crypto, you control both sides ... 
91 2018-04-03 23:50:21 nvm, Kucoin oldversion, found it
92 2018-04-03 23:50:11 It is not fair to judge someone solely on the date in which someone bought their first crypto. What is more important is the quality of the research and amount of time spent on it. Timing doesn't matter.
The market will ultimately decide.
93 2018-04-03 23:50:07 Unless we fight the moving averages on the way up. Different story. I don't think so though, too much progress in the space. Too oversold rn.
94 2018-04-03 23:50:01 Very creativity project!1
95 2018-04-03 23:49:51 How many "breaks" does one man need?
96 2018-04-03 23:49:42 $btc #bitcoin needs a pullback. Question is whether it favours the bulls with a reset in the $7.0-7.2k range or whether the bears jump on and push it sub-$7.0k and below.
97 2018-04-03 23:49:39 Switched your system on block chain & crypto currencies
98 2018-04-03 23:49:28 so you got it from the upbit website already? legend!
99 2018-04-03 23:49:16 As you know, using crypto in China is not so easy, but apps like Coincola and the Bitshares MagicWallet offer OTC services between RMB and cryptos. If you need links to those let me know. You've got my WeChat and QQ now

101 2018-04-03 23:49:00 Don't forget to check if it needs the new update before transferring your crypto! 
102 2018-04-03 23:48:37 We were really lucky with this. We got into our 希望 nursery on the first try. I can’t imagine what it would be like if we didn’t.
103 2018-04-03 23:48:35 Volatility in crypto will definitely increase as organic USE rises. Great post.
104 2018-04-03 23:48:29 And you.just figured that out?..lol  Have you see iota FOUNDATION new hires? Lately?
105 2018-04-03 23:48:26 If you're not working with a big position wait for confirmation with a "break, hook, and go" above the MAs as @HypedOnCrypto says. Better to miss out on 10-20% on the way up than lose 30-50 buying too soon. And follow those guys, they'll prob. live stream the whole event.

132 2018-04-03 23:44:15 I also think the bottom has been seen. Looks just like every other correction, except with bigger numbers. My analysis is mostly sideways action for a week or two untill we get out of this wedge and over MAs. Break 20k again sometime around June, 38-50k round Oct.

140 2018-04-03 23:43:28 Los crypto currency son solo formulas matemáticas, no se si hay algún caco lo suficientemente brillante para crear una pero creo que les has dado tremenda idea.
141 2018-04-03 23:43:08 Zaman now ngutangnya pake duit fiat. Zaman nanti pake uang crypto, gak tahu dah urusannya gimana.

144 2018-04-03 23:42:31 Right, and selectively pointing to times they were right (leaving out the ugly) also paints a false picture. We want to make a historical "proof-of-accuracy" on the blockchain a requirement for giving crypto investment tips - what do you think of this concept?

227 2018-04-03 23:27:30 Ivy I get hard even without haters sometimes  but yes jokes apart, when you provide “time” and when people don’t value that, that hurts. And therefore I am clear, I will not help people for free. They need to do something in return by helping me in whichever way they can.
228 2018-04-03 23:27:22 So what should I buy since I haven't researched that hard

233 2018-04-03 23:26:51 1) (Most) people who are involved in crypto market are considered a novice when it comes to the financial market.

If you are looking for the market bottom, STOP rationalizing token mkt caps & token prices (most of which offer ZERO economic or tag-along rights). START demanding more infrastructure & utility over ponzi based dApps. We bottom when the delivery schedule turns.

277 2018-04-03 23:20:48 Divergences don't compare highs to lows. A bearish divergence would be either a higher high on price and a lower high on the indicator, or vice versa. Bullish divergence deals with lows, bearish deals with highs.

304 2018-04-03 23:16:31 Crypto is certainly contending with a major credibility problem. The answer can come from within. We can start insisting that "experts" stand behind a "proof of accuracy" written to a blockchain ledger so we can start muting scammy noise.

314 2018-04-03 23:14:43 Crypto Twitter has become a cesspool of scammers and fuckwits. Every bloody response has someone offering free ether if you send them ether first... FFS. You do right but be careful you don't soil your name for it

316 2018-04-03 23:14:09 8 hour workday is a vestige of 18th century industrial England. Children working in the factories and mines were sickened and weakened (not able to work as well) by 16 hour shifts. 8 hours gave enough recuperation time to maximise output. Now it’s just inefficient.

321 2018-04-03 23:13:34 Wake us up when you actually deliver. Show, don't tell. The whole crypto market is full of people claiming they've created/found the Holy Grail. That's why it's in this lousy state, with 105k$ to buy tweets and fraudulent ICO's and whatnot. So.. when fun? Soon (tm)?

364 2018-04-03 23:07:48 The most bearish person that I saw in crypto community. We will see soon if you just like to be bearish or you see the big picture. I think Picasso see the big picture. :)
365 2018-04-03 23:07:48 The crypto world has come to a point, where it is a playground for many kids and people who wants to take advantage of it. Basically this behavior is frightening future investors, and it also gives governments ammunition to make it a living hell.
366 2018-04-03 23:07:44 Yes I understand the premise. Truly a revolutionary evolution of pyramid schemes.

374 2018-04-03 23:06:36 Crypto's problems can be solved from within. We should be able to review a distributed ledger to check the accuracy of self-proclaimed 'experts' before listening to them. That will help filter out self-interested misinformation and bring greater accountability.

431 2018-04-03 22:57:28 But: this guy says he saw the shooter shoot the one woman 10 times as she laid on the floor. That clearly doesn’t seem to have happened. 3 of the victims (police say there r 4) don’t even need surgery at this time per the doc at the trauma hospital.
432 2018-04-03 22:57:27 Crypto luvs them some hype. @ChangeTip, anyone?
433 2018-04-03 22:57:24 Thats how I was feeling. TRX is still in sell/HODL mode right now on the 4 hour and has been since the 31st. I personally sold out at a small loss earlier, there was simply too much profitable opportunity.
434 2018-04-03 22:57:19 Neither, those you are right on. But it depends on perspective! If you believe the coins you are mining will be extremely valuable, then way your costs. This Ethash miner is cool, but won’t be profitable for long. On Ethereum that is.
435 2018-04-03 22:57:14 Felines FTW.
436 2018-04-03 22:56:52 Ah ok. I remember hearing about this autonomous, self sustaining Ponzi scheme a little while back. Finally we have decentralized pyramid schemes! Interesting to see how this plays out. Potentially devastating for those that get involved. Like BCC and Davor
437 2018-04-03 22:56:51 We got to hold here.
438 2018-04-03 22:56:50 Gold is tax free and some have said it's a barter trade but it's an evolving issue. In Germany its more clear. If you hold crypto for more than a year and then trade to gold its tax free

443 2018-04-03 22:55:13 That’s a science fair experiment I keep trying to get people with middle and high school age kids to do. Someone comes in, interaction with teacher, kids get a questionnaire right after, 3 days later and 2 weeks later.
444 2018-04-03 22:54:52 2.>> To add what do you think the SOFON cards does for Bitmain.. don't see it in many places.. what they do..? Possibly they are part of their own mining gear  - that's what I think based on their R&D capabilities.. SC1 and SC1+ cards #RIPETHASH #RIPMINING

So don't think ASICS are not possibility for ETHASH.. but are very real.

514 2018-04-03 22:43:20 I believe it was/is merely "personal reasoning".  All choices are personal, even if socially conditioned. Part of the personal reasoning is reasonably "... a lot of other people like this stuff ..." Gold & Crypto have objectively definable, but subjectively human-valuable traits.

585 2018-04-03 22:29:46 The fact that exchanges ask millions of dollars from developers to list their coin is an attack on $crypto because of that only ICO's can afford to get listed on bigger exchanges while legit launched projects with no premine have absolutely no chance to pay such amounts of money.
586 2018-04-03 22:29:26 Aha, so that is why Dexes are the new  kids on the block.(chain)
Hope the exchanges are awake as well.

590 2018-04-03 22:28:53 It would allow for accountability in crypto advertisements. Would definitely get the word out there and hopefully bring in some new believers.
591 2018-04-03 22:28:35 @lazoozorg is the closest I know of, but I don't know much about how far along or widespread it is. Most thought leaders in the crypto space that I've read seem to think that it's this kind of thing is way out, like trying to invent a TNC in 1996.

603 2018-04-03 22:27:05 People seriously go to that extent to deceive on this platform?  Simply unbelievable! . We should all be pulling for each other.  This crypto can be good for all investors and benefits everyone that way.  Why cheat and steal or manipulate?  Or purposely try to rek someone?

613 2018-04-03 22:25:02 "add millions of dollars to the value of cryptocurrency" You mean to the marketcap of crypto. He is certainly not giving it any more value, especially with these shit ICO's he has been promoting.
614 2018-04-03 22:25:00 Back to where it was when it was first on my radar. If alt season ever returns it’s going to be lit.
615 2018-04-03 22:24:42 Exchange suddenly goes down due to an "error" and all the folks that are staking their tokens cannot access to cash out their funds. Massive sell off ensues leaving token holders with valueless bags. Weak hands will be proven at the top of the pyramid. We've seen this before.

621 2018-04-03 22:23:37 Key thing about GPUs: millions of people already have one. They can start mining crypto after spending $0 on new hardware. It's hard to seize power over something which is already created in massive quantities for unrelated reasons!

663 2018-04-03 22:16:39 The most important contribution that crypto makes to economics is that when the state takes away cash & coin, peope will still have true digital cash. True sovereign money. Some people still don't understand that this is the true value of bitcoin.
664 2018-04-03 22:15:49 It is absolutely stupid that crypto PoS terminals are not everywhere and easily integrated for merchants to fiat.

There is still so much growth left in this space it is not even funny.

694 2018-04-03 22:11:52 Yes, was a very swift fix
695 2018-04-03 22:11:44 I own 5 farms & mining before Wall Street even heard the term crypto. This will not hurt AMD or Nvidia 1) BIOS finetuned for optimal performance ideal for Nvidia & AMD. 2) Ether is 1 of 100s of coins being mined 3) Wallstreet needs to stop pretending they understand crypto
696 2018-04-03 22:11:34 Personally something switched me right of BCH. A couple of things I could mention again but won't & some other things I can't put my finger on. That said, the first mass adopter that gets burnt by 0 conf could make a bit of a stink for crypto generally. So be careful BCH ppl.
697 2018-04-03 22:11:06 lol yeah, 0 fucks given, they already know they are the top exchange in the USA for crypto imo. So of course, its given that Binance wont last as the #1 exchange in volume but maybe customer satisfaction.

730 2018-04-03 22:07:46 against AV and AI driving at this point. IMHO, AV is happening and NVDA will be the leader. 

On the Crypto front, Management has tried to be more tempered in its expectations. remember it's still up big YoY, but the psychological effect could hurt NVDA and $AMD in the ST. //

736 2018-04-03 22:06:33 hi
737 2018-04-03 22:06:25 amazing guys. Yes we would like crypto to be widely used in mainstream. all the best guys.
738 2018-04-03 22:06:24 Where did your medium article go? It was the most useful paper we've had those last months.
739 2018-04-03 22:06:15 Hey @nicksdjohnson! We have extended this offer to many other Ethereum contributors and would certainly love to include you as a guest on our podcast! Let us know if we can work around your schedule.
740 2018-04-03 22:06:10 Panelists at Deutsche Bank #blockchain panel: the #crypto economy may be 2-3 years away from mass adoption. Expect to see a decentralized Uber competitor.
741 2018-04-03 22:06:09 Maybe we will see the light this time #crypto #xrp #bitcoin
742 2018-04-03 22:06:04 We are starting to see the right path, will take some time but #crypto will live on #Btc #Ltc #patience #xrpthestandard
743 2018-04-03 22:06:04 Who is going to #BlockchainExpo #London? Can't wait for the event, project managers and team leaders - reach out to us, tell us more about your projects! 
@Blockchain_Expo should be a great event! #crypto #ico
744 2018-04-03 22:05:56 It was adjusted for capacity right away
745 2018-04-03 22:05:55 Oh yeah this dudes on point
746 2018-04-03 22:05:29 This doesn't match the data either. First, the complete protocol with RSA includes both encryption (with partner's key) and decryption (with own key), so the time should be 15.3ms instead. 1/2
747 2018-04-03 22:05:25 @RobinhoodApp will be the hands down choice when they enable deposits AND withdrawals of crypto.

No comparison with the price gouging, hidden circuit breakers, and backroom dealings of @coinbase
748 2018-04-03 22:05:15 Still cant withdraw crypto. If I can't move it then I don't own it. I don't think they own 1 bitcoin at all.

753 2018-04-03 22:04:55 I think that since everyone thinks the BTC will go to 7,700 and then it will bounce down, that I definitely won't do that.
754 2018-04-03 22:04:49 Dude. I never supported a scammer. I'm just not interested in someone who jumps in my threads with some total different shit what I must read.

827 2018-04-03 21:56:39 People, TA techniques used on stock markets doesn't work on crypto, at leas not yet, still some MCM forecasting does work at some extent.

With that on mid #LTC litecoin, #ICX and #OMG shows the best bull scenarios for the upcoming 52 days. Still, ICX will shine brighter Q4 2019
828 2018-04-03 21:56:17 Something big is happening.

829 2018-04-03 21:56:08 Also, for those who understand blockchain, Dragonchain's hybrid approach is ideal for businesses. You can't store all of the information from Enterprise relational databases on the blockchain alone. In order to do business with large organizations, hybrid is the only way to go.
830 2018-04-03 21:56:05 I bet it dumps either right before or after the announcement. It’s doing all its pumping now
831 2018-04-03 21:55:53 Still doesn't look like we're going to be in a bigtime bull run anytime soon IMO just not seeing enough volume to sustain this growth. #crypto #bitcoin #bearish #cryptocurrency
832 2018-04-03 21:55:50 Interesting, why do they charge money (1 m) from coins when they make billions on trading. I think there is more spoofing with no fee.

873 2018-04-03 21:46:59 That is the thing, you assume that someone is always trying to kill $xvg. The truth is that some people realized the scheme of Sunerok and Whale a long time ago and are just trying to protect people from ur PnD. And no, not until u buy something from the DW using ur non-pvt coin

907 2018-04-03 21:42:06 Finally home!  Being out of action for a few weeks in the crypto-game is like years.  Have my work cut out for me but I'm going to be laid up for a few months anyways.  Time to start digging!  Hope everyone is well!
908 2018-04-03 21:42:06 I don’t know, looks too beautiful to be true... There is a lot of people in crypto in this « early » market. Hard to think we are all going to be rich in 2 or 3 years

910 2018-04-03 21:41:49 What about a Death Rally? Personally Crypto is too unpredictable to apply such things to, you can to a certain point, but we were definitely in a small bubble... just wait for the massive one to come.
911 2018-04-03 21:41:33 I should probably have  separate accounts for Crypto and Politics.  I know some followers of one may not appreciate my thoughts on the other.  But then again, they are ultimately inseparable in real life...  Anybody actually read these and have an opinion?

919 2018-04-03 21:40:36 Umm $eth, $ltc, $xmr, $nano, even freaking bitconnect had its use once upon a time. I guess since you don’t know about any of the coins with use cases, that is why you invest in $xvg and write stuff like this where apparently market will never correct.

The amount that you should put in is the nexus between how much you would be distraught about putting in if it went to zero, & how much you would be distraught about not putting in if it went to the moon.

1007 2018-04-03 21:28:52 2 years ago 5K was a crazy prediction. Now 130K.
1008 2018-04-03 21:28:45 It's best to be packing some heat if you are going to wear crypto as jewelry....
1009 2018-04-03 21:28:41 If it was a crypto I would’ve bought it. Don’t have the time to set up online trading account and learn that. My loss

Who are you favorite crypto influencers?

We think PascalCoin is under-rated and doesn't have the visibility it deserves for it's unique SafeBox tech. Plus, V3 bring a lot of improvements.

1039 2018-04-03 21:25:12 Wait, what? I saw that tweet on April 1st and I thought it was an April fool, lol.
1040 2018-04-03 21:25:04 Somewhat irrelevant to the general crypto space though... I also trust my friends and family. Maybe this was meant to be a joke?
1041 2018-04-03 21:24:53 Do you accept crypto
1042 2018-04-03 21:24:37 I wish I could do that. I like verge a lot and I have believed in it since I have stepped in to the crypto world but I don't have much funds to support the cause plus I'm a victim of BitConnect. I've lost most of money there. Having a really hard time paying off my debt.
1043 2018-04-03 21:24:33 This makes sense if you consider the Elliott Wave Principle. There is a possibility that the current correction in $BTC is a larger degree wave 2 b4 next uptrend. That makes the final low to be very important IMO & fits the "early adopters" scenario well too.
1044 2018-04-03 21:24:24 What theee
1045 2018-04-03 21:24:20 We all need more coq in our life
1046 2018-04-03 21:24:07 also blindly hodling probably will lead us all to wealthy freedom but fuck... there is 100x's more money to be made just by putting a little more effort. i'm thankfully up 10x's since my initial investment. but that could be 100x's if i traded it properly on this times.
1047 2018-04-03 21:23:57 Oh ok. Nothing factual, just personal opinion. That’s cool. I’m always interested to know why someone likes or dislikes something, since I’m still new to crypto.
1048 2018-04-03 21:23:39 You hear about MyBit Token? No press, all work, all partnerships, all about the money. Low supply, Big Team, Bigger message.
1049 2018-04-03 21:23:32 i see the opposite dude. For months I've seen new lower targets, even ZERO, when BTC goes down 500. Because of the doom predictions i think 75k tgt is doable

1070 2018-04-03 21:21:06 This is what crypto needs

1072 2018-04-03 21:21:05 Just got off the phone with someone and we were discussing how many of crypto guru's have got it wrong in jan , in feb and in march and back tracked on there talk without highlighting how wrong they got it !   

Im not sure if it is ego but one thing is for sure it is funny !
1073 2018-04-03 21:20:55 Lol... can't believe that google would actually  send a message like this... grammar mistake in last sentence, and lame explanation as of why they can't reveal the reason.... I think you're actually being hacked and they try you to reveal more details via adv. Sec. Program
1074 2018-04-03 21:20:51 If they are good (and these are delicious), then yes! Although not very healthy! haha
1075 2018-04-03 21:20:45 And people say crypto is volatile...

1079 2018-04-03 21:19:58 Bnb all the way
1080 2018-04-03 21:19:40 so many alts looking ready like this at the moment 
1081 2018-04-03 21:19:38 for sure boss. will always be a good time to learn and improve your skills and will never be too much. next bull season is over there, and what matters more is what you learned from your last mistakes. have a nice week you all, best regards from brazil :p
1082 2018-04-03 21:19:35 You're implying that the alignment is mutually supported and strategic without proof. Such defamatory statements, "unless you want to lose your money," are libelous. Crypto Bobby that's too much! Ouchy for PoWH3D.
1083 2018-04-03 21:19:31 I joined in late May bullrun. Learned a lot since then, but still a long way to go. Putting a lot more time and effort into learning, reading and catching up with healthy habits (food/sports/family/friends...) during this bear run.
1084 2018-04-03 21:19:17 Surprised to see that people are still dumb enough to fall for Sunerok’s PnD for the millionth time. When will people actually grow up and invest in projects with real use cases? $xvg is as useless as it can be.
1085 2018-04-03 21:19:00 Thanks for selling me your bag for dirt cheap for future top 10 crypto
1086 2018-04-03 21:18:56 Chris, Hello from Spain.  First time Tweeting you. Just want to let you know ive been watching you (from Philakone/Crypto Jhonny) for awhile now.  Thanks for your time and helping the community. Since Phil has been away Im comparing my chart to yours. Learning from you too. BLESS
1087 2018-04-03 21:18:45 Honestly I don't have a go-to indicator. Way too much at play that must be considered. In #crypto, knowing market sentiment is more powerful then TA at times. But everything plays an important role and it all needs to be analyzed together. 
A bit of good luck is also helpful 
1088 2018-04-03 21:18:43 Ne pas FOMO, lors d’un ATH, il y a toujours d’autres opportunités qui se présentent par la suite.

1093 2018-04-03 21:18:26 It's probably because you ask for donations from time to time. They want to make sure it's going where you say it is.
1094 2018-04-03 21:18:25 Seriously who cares

1164 2018-04-03 21:09:14 If we close above 2450 sat. That would be the confirmation of the right shoulder breaking the neckline of the H&S, plus the Eve crossing Adams level.
Double bullish confirmation.
Awesome. Allright, ROI is around 1/7.
In the end all of this is just a game of possibilities.

1168 2018-04-03 21:08:53 Debate is healthy, but I think true believers in crypto have enough in common not to drag each other down whether they think one or another protocol is "the one". We get enough hostility from the crypto sceptics already :)

1279 2018-04-03 20:56:43 And 20000 very soon!!!
1280 2018-04-03 20:56:37 There are three types of Jews:
- Jews (Torah)
- Fake Jews (Crypto Jews)
- Zionist Jews (Kabbalah, Talmud)
Some of these Jews hate other Jews, and they hate non Jews - "Goyims".
"We" (Goyims) are not allowed to discussing this, risking persecucion!
1281 2018-04-03 20:56:35 We're not an automated trading platform guaranteeing a certain % gains and we're not a lending platform guaranteeing a certain % daily compounding interest.

But thanks for the analysis. 

Neat comment bro.
1282 2018-04-03 20:56:34 My bag wouldn't do too much devastation if dumped
1283 2018-04-03 20:56:15 But based on your TA we can probably expect at least a 20% pump right?
At least that's what usually haooens after the inverted H&S.
1284 2018-04-03 20:56:12 1 more time "sir" and I will tweet 2 weeks that your charts suck ;-)
1285 2018-04-03 20:55:57 Very creativity project!!
1286 2018-04-03 20:55:56 The investor, attracting a new partner to the project, will receive a bonus: 2% of the total amount invested. Team and all investors that will make this dream true!

1287 2018-04-03 20:55:51 Idea for a good aptitude test - asking them to explain certain crypto building block concepts (e.g. mining, proof of work, hash rate) as if they were explaining it to a 5-yr old. Shld be good to see who is already thinking abt it
1288 2018-04-03 20:55:35 ... much better wording! now 2k sats!
1289 2018-04-03 20:55:24 Won’t they be rewarded when $XVG pumps and they sell their bags
1290 2018-04-03 20:55:21 No idea. Honestly.
1291 2018-04-03 20:55:15 As always, sooo late to the party. Probably they waited to have 3 exchange confirmations :))))
1292 2018-04-03 20:55:10 There are no outrageous fees involved in buying crypto. One option:

1. Wire USD to Coinbase 
2. Transfer USD from Coinbase to GDAX (takes 3 seconds)
3. Buy LTC via a Buy Limit order ($0 fees)

Also, check out the Square Cash app. Makes buying BTC easy.

1296 2018-04-03 20:54:51 Trevon james linked it in his last youtube video ; crypto bobby said, that craig grant is supporting it (didn`t research on this one)... Smells like scam...
1297 2018-04-03 20:54:39 To piggyback, I think this change will happen in Asia first. I fear the level of control US banks want to hold as as the biggest challenge Ripple will face.  However, if Ripple can prove it offers a more robust, secure, and returnable investment, it could zoom 3-7 yrs

1299 2018-04-03 20:54:28 Similar story to yours Ann, my son influenced me.  Crypto has  also made interested in studying TA to start trading on the ASX when I know what I’m doing :) Fortunately dollar cost averaging has brought my XRP down, nows it’s a waiting game.

1316 2018-04-03 20:52:20 6. Be consistent - If you are buying and selling in similar situation, there's something wrong with your discipline/trade plan.

I see this in crypto. Everyone is bullish one day longing entries, only to be closing them and shorting positions the next day or two days later.

1326 2018-04-03 20:51:05 Crypto is a gamble. Very hard to predict which way the break will occur after a resistance level has concluded. Will it be up or down?
1327 2018-04-03 20:51:00 doin it RIGHT
1328 2018-04-03 20:50:52 Yeah and prob be back to 600 after the ‘news’ 
1329 2018-04-03 20:50:50 Perhaps a web-based Crypto Miner? Like Coinhive or something similar.

1338 2018-04-03 20:49:52 My guess is they want tomography data of healthy individuals to use in neuroscience ML models. Not CAT but actual slices. My guess also is that large quantities of ingested chemicals were involved when the idea was hatched. Also perhaps some crypto currency Kool Aid.
1339 2018-04-03 20:49:51 Forgot actual biggest risk btw @notsofast dumping his bag haha
1340 2018-04-03 20:49:23 Перспективная платформа, отличная идея
1341 2018-04-03 20:49:22 I came across the app eToro. I looked at crypto and started to look at the ones they offered. If somebody from Facebook goes to a company called Ripple, the company must be serious. Then finding out the “coin” had a management and ..... David Schwarz, I was sold.... and bought!!!
1342 2018-04-03 20:49:08 Look at the bottom of macd & rsi for bullish divergence in a downtrend, and tops of macd & rsi for bearish divergence in uptrend.
1343 2018-04-03 20:49:01 I follow her coz of her integrity.  Asian men in suits can’t be trusted in crypto 
1344 2018-04-03 20:49:00 Oh also, you followed me. Despite me being pretty vocally anti crypto. Like, dude, what did you expect?
1345 2018-04-03 20:48:56 There are several levels of security:

1 - Least Secure, 7 - Most Secure

1. Anti-virus/malware software
2. 2FA and-above(aa)
3. VPN aa
4. TOR aa
5. Virtual Machine aa
6. Security OS on local and VM aa
7. Security OS on USB aa

If you're in crypto, do everything upto level  3
1346 2018-04-03 20:48:54 I think the project will succeed. Very expecting when it's added to exchange markets. #P2PSF #Crypto #Altcoin #Blockchain #ICO @p2psf

1353 2018-04-03 20:48:10 i wouldn't take advice from @TateStevens he has lost a ton of money during the downturn, which is something an experienced trader wouldn't have fallen victim to. he's a total newb, proven psycho, and stinks and crypto. just today, he's made at least a dozen losing trades
1354 2018-04-03 20:48:03 Crypto investment feels like gambling to me. Anyways I think #TIO is quite solid, the platform is 50% finished and could well be an alternative to CFD's, which is a huge market. At 3x profit I'll cash out my initial investment and hodl rest with trailing.
1355 2018-04-03 20:48:03 Hopefully it's not only me but I've noticed, though casually, that crypto has of late been rising and dropping by between 8.1% and 8.3%. Why is it always in that window? Is it manipulation? @BTCTN @VitalikButerin @SatoshiLite @Ripple_XRP1 @Photochain_io #Ripple #volatilemarket

1366 2018-04-03 20:46:41 The only ways to lose money in crypto:
- time the markets
- weak hands
- investing money that you cannot keep in the markets long-term

1414 2018-04-03 20:41:46 am i high... or is it crypto...?
1415 2018-04-03 20:41:45 Excellent!

Our Satoshi, who art in Heaven. Bitcoin be thy name. Your miners come. Your blockchain be done, in Altcoins as it is in Ethereum.

1420 2018-04-03 20:40:58 crypto is an IQ test and you failed miserably.
1421 2018-04-03 20:40:47 You fool, yuo absolute galoot, it is obvious that *Trotsky* was the crypto-brony of the early 20th C. communist movement
1422 2018-04-03 20:40:35 I don't know why it matters so much too you. Obviously they've been around for a long time and continue to improve on their development. So too me it looks like a project moving forward. Can't hate on them for that. That's what I thought crypto was all about.

1435 2018-04-03 20:39:29 Hmmm.   I suppose Citi doesn’t recognize SBI  as a leading banking system.  The US’s problem is that it always protects banks instead of making them competitive through innovation. Well, banking is about change with or without Citi.
1436 2018-04-03 20:39:25 This project includes a number of best things: great team, great product, great idea, great start! We need products and ideas! I'm sure the company will occupy a leading place in this world! Offer to take part in ICO!

1445 2018-04-03 20:38:25 there are three tier levels of donation for those who donated 2500 or more... it was a way to incentivize the crowd fund campaign to draw in more funds. so yes, the reward system is for those tier level donations.
1446 2018-04-03 20:38:05 will never agree with crypto currencies util the program is changed and given a finite point which means it has to be given in when "full" and another one issued, 
bitcoin is just too "small" to be used effectively by the world !!!

1451 2018-04-03 20:37:45 Never mind -- the governor just really, really likes carfentanyl.
1452 2018-04-03 20:37:42 Show me exactly where this was stated. Word for word as you quoted it please
1453 2018-04-03 20:37:37 Also, i was under the impression you only had to record, report, and pay taxes on your crypto-fiat txns
1454 2018-04-03 20:37:32 U just made a whole telegram mess lmfao nice. Can't even type yet people joint every 0.5 seconds.  Strong crypto godfather lol
1455 2018-04-03 20:37:27 It's because the crypto market is completely manipulated by a small number of hands (including bankers), and he has yet to admit it. In many ways, it is now no different than the Dow or the NASDAQ, especially with CME future trading going on.Many remain in denial.

The taxable ramifications of small dollar purchases make this a non starter. Then you compound the potential losses from giving up crypto assets for something like a coffee.

1551 2018-04-03 20:28:13 I believe the cost is even lower than that. Optimal strategy computes O(k log k) ell-isogenies where each ell-isogeny takes a constant number of field multiplications requiring k log k (Schönhage-Strassen FFT) each. Therefore, the overall soft-quadratic O(k^2 log^2 k) complexity.

1563 2018-04-03 20:26:40 @ZackShapiro Could you share some light on the fact that my balance is 0 even though I havent touched the wallet or crypto for months. Looks like this happened during your merge from Raiwallet to Nanowallet, and I have friends with the same issue. Transactions are unavailable...

1567 2018-04-03 20:26:12 No? If we were cool with him promoting this as serious investment, that would be alignment. But we aren't. Period.
1568 2018-04-03 20:25:52 It's just arrests. Remember that that the Syrian border is still pourous (aprx. 2 million illegal Syrians in Turkey right now) so arresting few hundred you men as suspects not difficult. Anyways, many ISIS ops are winding down in Syria and they're running back the way they came.
1569 2018-04-03 20:25:49 Course but you could say that about every penny crypto....

1580 2018-04-03 20:24:34 @crypto_bobby knows his shit. How people still fall for this crap after Bitconnect, Davor Coin, LendConnect. @Gahsto  I'll take that as a complement Bobby is a smart dude.

1657 2018-04-03 20:17:25 thats not the reason for the price drop lmao, day traders buy in before announcements hoping it will be something huge, turns out was just a thankyou to holders so they dumped nothing new in crypto

1663 2018-04-03 20:17:08 Like, we're not talking anybody into investing into our literal meme of a game. We're not even advertising this as anything that it isn't. Bitconnect and Davor clearly deceived their users by themselves. They didn't need the almight Craig to bring them down.
1664 2018-04-03 20:17:03 Sense8 was one of my favorite shows. Love the Watchowskis.

1709 2018-04-03 20:12:57 Just bought some last night. About to explode I think!
1710 2018-04-03 20:12:55 @IvanOnTech  has succesfully integrated crypto payments in his courses , ask him for help ;)
1711 2018-04-03 20:12:55 The SEC probably wants that. But I see the opposite from the exchanges, moving to friendlier jurisdictions, going all crypto, etc. Maybe a usdt crackdown.
1712 2018-04-03 20:12:54 You're my new favorite crypto twitter personality for mentioning Mother 3. If you do an Earthbound meme you will win the internet.
1713 2018-04-03 20:12:43 OMG surely hes gotta get nicked pulling all these moves and scams
1714 2018-04-03 20:12:36 And big fat fries.
1715 2018-04-03 20:12:35 that's why we love crypto:D  there are patterns, but GOD DAMN motherfucker is unpredictable <3
1716 2018-04-03 20:12:33 You're a dumb a$$...shame what people will do for likes. #doyourresearchdickwad
1717 2018-04-03 20:12:33 Thank you for the link, I want to make sure my contacts in India are aware of this organization. They're in India and promoting Bitcoin and crypto for economic development and educating local and regional authorities about it. India looks set to make great progress with Bitcoin!
1718 2018-04-03 20:12:30 So your saying to sell all my personal possessions (including the dog) and buy as many Greek shipping companies and crypto tech companies as possible.
1719 2018-04-03 20:12:27 do you even understand how smart contracts work?
1720 2018-04-03 20:12:26 Everyone knows Craig Wright is a complete fraud yet there is still big money behind him to push his false narrative. It’s no hard to see he’s a fake propped up years ago by fake news to destabilize #bitcoin & crypto
1721 2018-04-03 20:12:25 that's exactly right - it took me a few views of Burn After Reading to realize it was much better than the so-so Coen Bros. effort I assessed it to be the first time I saw it
1722 2018-04-03 20:12:16 I recently saw this project and immediately realized that it would be a blast on the #cryptocurrency market,such companies almost does not exist anymore,take part #AKAIITO #ICO #ethereum #blockchain #token #AIC #Tokenization #crypto
1723 2018-04-03 20:12:07 Birçok bu tarz  gördüğüm paylaşımlara yorum olarak paylaşım üzerinde kendi fikrimi yazıp çizip atıyorum. Bunun sebebi kendimi gosternek degil. Takipçi peşinde de koşmuyorum. Tek amac ortak bir en iyiyi bulabilmek.
1724 2018-04-03 20:12:00 I think you're right bro! It looks like the next big surge will be in '19 or '20 this year is looking dire and it's very hard to say what alt coins will be the biggest boomer cuz of cryptos speculative nature. Don't see the crypto space doing Dec. '17 numbers anytime soon
1725 2018-04-03 20:12:00 Beer.
1726 2018-04-03 20:11:57 I see so many people crying and anguishing about this "crash" or "correction" we're going through. Sure, we're down from the peak.
But let me remind everyone that a year ago today;
           BTC=$1130, ETH=$46, & LTC=$8.
Today; BTC=$7500, ETH=$416, & LTC=$133.
1727 2018-04-03 20:11:55 When you buy a coin, ask yourself what you buy: a project or another cryptocurrency that will never replace the bitcoin?
If it’s a project,ask yourself if you would use it in your daily life. 
If yes, you bought a good coin

1748 2018-04-03 20:10:20 P.S. I indelibly associate that movie with the Apple vs. FBI case because I went to see it right after holing up with @granick in a hotel room downtown to write our amicus brief. In fact, I think I saw it the day the big EDNY decision came out in the other iPhone unlocking case.

1772 2018-04-03 20:08:15 So in the USA, every purchase of a product with Litecoin or Bitcoin requires you to also record the transaction as a gain or loss for tax purposes?  Will this be the downfall of all crypto? #bitcoin #IRS

1788 2018-04-03 20:06:31 Same strategy as always. Slice and dice it % wise based on fixed risk up to certain % for investments/illiquid coins, and stop-based with heavy % and trade invalidation for 1-2% loss.

1800 2018-04-03 20:05:31 No doubt. If you advise more than that, then you can't be doing much advising; probably you're just shilling. And if that's the case, then no point listening to a paid shill.

1843 2018-04-03 20:01:18 Suppoman and McAfee too. If a project or ICO enlists these people as 'advisors' or use them as means to get more investors, then you know that ICO makes poor decisions & isn't really a serious project. That's why I'm happy $icx told Ian to take a hike after his Moon-Lambo video.

1845 2018-04-03 20:01:17 Once mass adoption kicks in via the Open Platform, that would ensure more users are moving into online payments via cryptocurrencies. In turn this would reduce volatility as more people are aware of the benefits and convenience of crypto.
1846 2018-04-03 20:01:03 A bullish divergence implies a lower low in price, with the Macd histo not making a lower low. There are some on the Chart, but there are mistakes too (especially the one from feb low to march, wrong because there is no lower low in price). Dr ELDER, Two roads diverged, cheers.

1849 2018-04-03 20:00:44 Whatevs on the market cap, my point is every crypto came down.  But many people talk about verge like it was the only one dumped, im just saying the whole crypto space got dumped at that time
1850 2018-04-03 20:00:41 Bitcoin fell by 50% in the first quarter of 2018. On the other hand, we're up 7% in the last 24 hrs. What a difference a day makes.

1871 2018-04-03 19:59:38 It's why most tokens are doomed to failure. Because if BTC topples, it destroys the validity of a store of value in imaginary tokens. If another crypto can overtake it, it invalidates the whole thesis of it having value. That's why anti-Bitcoiners push other coins. To destroy it.

1882 2018-04-03 19:58:09 Remeber, if we look back at the amazing Q4 '17 and the drop in Q1 '18 in a couple of years from now, we'll most likely blame #ETH and it's #ICO's who killed crypto as a technology and turned it in wall street with all consequences like we see them arising today.

1889 2018-04-03 19:57:27 The market will eventually correct this. It's happening w advisor roles at the moment. Look at Ian Balina dumping tokens at 3x when he is their 'advisor'. His 'advising' is now becoming poison - an indication the ICO is looking for pumps over substance, and so should be avoided.

1901 2018-04-03 19:56:17 Aber wie gesagt. Am Ende ist alles Blabla. Solange ich jemanden finde, der was für etwas gibt, ist es was wert. Bei Crypto kann das sehr schnell gehen :)
1902 2018-04-03 19:56:16 many like myself are investing in crypto and stock market, it is plausible to think that if the one is dipping i should explore my options and review the other and keep the score board ticking
1903 2018-04-03 19:56:09 Needless to say, there are a lot of people on Wall Street that have zero (pun intended) faith in Byrne. And crypto has been battered, even though $OSTK isn't a bitcoin play. Only saving grace has been my short book in FAANG and $LFIN.
1904 2018-04-03 19:55:50 Hope you’re right
1905 2018-04-03 19:55:49 I had this issue yesterday. My buddy was all "I don't believe in crypto because it only has as much value as people put into the market, and I don't see currency going digital" I had to explain that fiat is the same, and there is more than that to crypto. He still didn't get it..

1964 2018-04-03 19:50:20 Blockchain and crypto-currency are trending topics, especially in Berlin. Maybe I should write fiction books about them. Like "Deadcoin"--a crypto-currency sci-fi thriller full of blockchaining suspense and fast-paced ledgers. #amwriting

Also we are seriously lacking in new buyers given how new investors have been stung of late. Seems like just Bitcoin traders trading Btc right now.

2035 2018-04-03 19:43:42 That’s the hard part, finding places that accept crypto as a currency. Also no one wants to spend their BTC/LTC/ETH ect,ect because we all believe that it will be worth more one day, there for we spend fiat instead.

2121 2018-04-03 19:35:59 Not really... I personally just use twitter for trolling, entertainment, and keeping up with crypto craziness. I don’t usually expect more from twitter than that. I’m surprised occasionally, but I don’t expect it from the medium.
2122 2018-04-03 19:35:41 A BIG thanks for providing the project information on $WAN! So much happening in the space and difficult to stay updated!

2127 2018-04-03 19:35:09 u think people will pump their cash in crypto if finance goes down?  ok...
2128 2018-04-03 19:34:32 I feel everyone owning a crypto st this stage feels like a hero that they are bypassing the system of regulation though it’s not really, I too believe it’s pure speculation at this point of time
2129 2018-04-03 19:34:31 Got into crypto around Oct-Nov 2017. First btc, tx-fees were half my profit, so looked for a cheap coin. Think ETC was the first I tried, then I thought I'd better know something about where I put my money in. Went down the top 10 at CMC, stopped at xrp. No need to look further.
2130 2018-04-03 19:34:30 Thank god for crypto twitter, our main source of information :D!
2131 2018-04-03 19:34:25 No it doesnt, @VitalikButerin is 10x the crypto power House. Sun is fooling alot of people.
2132 2018-04-03 19:34:07 U mean inverse head and shoulders?
2133 2018-04-03 19:34:05 Sounds great, this is well needed in the crypto spheres.
2134 2018-04-03 19:33:56 how do you even value a crypto? LOL
2135 2018-04-03 19:33:52 @ProfFaustus how many Vitaliks could you beat up at the same time?

2137 2018-04-03 19:33:44 Pay attention on this prospective company. High-quality, flexible investment and transparency making them a perfect resource for investors who want to explore crypto without risking a future. I recommend it. @devcrypt_io #devcryptio
2138 2018-04-03 19:33:36 Uses crypto to disintermediate... uses a payment processor as an intermediary. You sure get the point?
2139 2018-04-03 19:33:31 Remember when bitcoiners were making "Over 9000" jokes? 
Many crypto projects and the space as a whole have been working, maturing, and improving since then.
Green or red days, the technology is not going anywhere.
2140 2018-04-03 19:33:16 OPEN has started the turnaround of silent operations of the past to knowledge based and volatile operations in  cryptosystem. The multiplier effect of OPEN activities will surely increase crypto utility in no time.

2206 2018-04-03 19:26:58 When everything goes up, it’s easy to make winning calls. The real winners are the ones that actually take profits. As soon as BTC heads back down, that “win” quickly becomes a loss, unless you know when to exit.

2212 2018-04-03 19:26:24 The problem I have with this statement is that if you look at price history. Most good projects return to there ATH. If I am going to believe this statement, then BTC will not be going back to 20K and ETH is not going back to $1400 and NEO to $200 etc.. I believe they are IMHO
2213 2018-04-03 19:26:22 This is the question I pondered when @DavidHayCrypto mentioned using crypto to help the people of Venezuela.  Handing out crypto for their benefit which is great, but how would they earn it back?

2258 2018-04-03 19:21:52 1/ Life's trials made me forget about crypto in 2013/14. The rapper @NipseyHussle had mentioned he invested in crypto in a YT video from 2016 and that reminded me. I was looking for a cheap investment, which was XRP. I signed up for @Bitstamp. To my surprise XRP had a use case

2263 2018-04-03 19:21:21 You nailed it! Congrats you win crypto Twitter today... Even though @VitalikButerin 's live tweeting was pretty awesome.

2270 2018-04-03 19:21:05 Money flowing out of stock markets into crypto?
2271 2018-04-03 19:21:05 it's a service imo, idk how the government would approach this, think there is nothing in existence that is stressed that much by every circunstance like crypto exchanges, you can imagine binance being the top exchange how hard it is to give users a awesome experience.
2272 2018-04-03 19:21:01 @DougPolkPoker Why are so many twitter folks so nasty to you when all you do is provide your strategic thoughts and opinions on poker and the same on crypto. Don’t these people realize how foolish they look? Jealousy, perhaps?

2323 2018-04-03 19:17:21 I can answer that. Misinformation, personal bias, or own stock in big pharma. There is no other reasons. At all. I have no time for ANYONE who chooses personal beliefs or portfolio over people's pain. Backspaced some swear words just now.
2324 2018-04-03 19:17:16 I see you and I raise with a footnoted explanation of 'crypto = cryptography, not cryptocurrency'
2325 2018-04-03 19:17:07 Yeah, kind of weird. One chart says this other charts says that. What is it lol?

2328 2018-04-03 19:16:52 I’m going to go ahead and say it because I know everybody is thinking it. 

The ONLY reason we are seeing any sort of bounce in the crypto market is solely due to the fact that verge is about to reveal the biggest partnership in crypto history.

2347 2018-04-03 19:14:33 Probably more to come too. The SEC is investigating Crypto Hedge Funds and ICOs. I feel that the market could drop more because of this. #cryptocurrency
2348 2018-04-03 19:14:30 exactly. there are 300k coins mined per day..
2349 2018-04-03 19:14:28 $ostk IMO, crypto market starting massive rally, should continue with continued US stock market volatilty/political instability.  This is good for $OSTK, and coupled with all clear from SEC/Tzero ICO completion, should drive shares higher.

2353 2018-04-03 19:14:02 why are you so angry about a meme of a dog chasing water spouts anyway? Is it because that's what you do? You may need to lay off the crypto, probably not for you if you are this stressed.

2402 2018-04-03 19:07:26 your last statement is where we disagree. Just because it was over valued as shit last season doesnt mean it will return there. 31B is over 10% of the entire crypto market cap currently. Unless ADA has Dapps being used and starts doing more transactions, going short is the play

At the same time, Safein will standardize crypto payments on all e-commerce websites. Currently, there is no single large-scale Payment Service Provider (PSP) which accepts both, fiat and crypto payments.
2405 2018-04-03 19:07:03 Today’s video coming up at 9PM BST! Today we’re looking at #SouthKorea’s new crypto currency, as well as #gasprom getting into cryptos. Don’t worry we’ll also look st @CoinMarketCap’s Mooners and Losers 
2406 2018-04-03 19:06:45 Verge made biggest crypto partnership till date. Name of that company will be revealed on 17th April!
Check @vergecurrency for details!
2407 2018-04-03 19:06:39 Investing in CCA project is a promising investment in the development of fast-growing production with a high level of profitability and a minimum payback period

2409 2018-04-03 19:06:29 Seems like a lot of new “the enemy of my enemy” kinships going on in Crypto-Twitter. 

Wait, who is the enemy?
2410 2018-04-03 19:06:09 I don't see it that way. In crypto we are exchanging money equally, but since more and more people arrive the first investors end up having more than they put in, the only loosers are the ones that stay in fiat.

2416 2018-04-03 19:05:40 That's a strawman argument. You still didn't show any cryptosystem with a guaranteed lower-bound attack complexity. What is the cryptosystem (the ref you offered was no such thing), and what is the guarantee?
2417 2018-04-03 19:05:37 I don't know if you know, but BTC is exact the same. Pump and dump. And i guess you have btc? So don't make such comment lol
2418 2018-04-03 19:05:35 The loudest collective voice from crypto about securities laws *should* be how *they* need to adapt and grow.

What are we working for if we're bent into the structures of the old paradigm?

5. $NXS score: 2.3077
2428 2018-04-03 19:04:22 Even accounting for the slightly harder dip it took during the market fall, LTC recovering strong and early! Looks like most coins recovering have use cases, transparent teams, or both. Controlled burns of the crypto space make me more excited for LTC rather than nervous!
2429 2018-04-03 19:04:21 Volatility is the reason why a lot of people have never invested in crypto. it's inevitable however, reducing it would turn the cryptosphere around for good
2430 2018-04-03 19:04:20 You could simply say "email us if you wish to pay manually by crypto" and take payments directly for now, it'd set a good precedent that it's always an option.

2452 2018-04-03 19:02:15 $OCN is a solid project and is currently below ICO price... so doesnt sound very stupid to me. One, if not the only, crypto with a real-world use case right now ... not just a whitepaper

2528 2018-04-03 18:53:38 is this the ugliest day for crypto? Or the worst is still mid may?

2536 2018-04-03 18:52:57 He's probably just straight up lying about it, as well as the politically conservative rabbi he just haopens to know. Kurt is not exactly known for his honesty.
2537 2018-04-03 18:52:48 They need a crypto currency anonymous for all the degenerate poker players going broke on it. Should have at least blew your bankrolls on hookers and blow you fucking insufferable goobers.

2541 2018-04-03 18:52:41 It's just my coastal elitism shining through, luv u buddy
2542 2018-04-03 18:52:40 One thing thats always gonna be a problem, not many want to admit, is trying to maintain money ideas. People work so hard at keeping it around. Eventually, humanity with have to evolve beyond this. I like crypto as a transition effort away from the current establishment system
2543 2018-04-03 18:52:34 Aynen öyle. Canlı yayınlar, twitter paylaşımlar ciddi amatör. Justin biraz geliştir kendini! Binance Ceo su harika. Paylaşımları, kriz yönetimi, sosyal medya paylaşımları, karizma, kurumsallık, tv canlı yayınları harika.
2544 2018-04-03 18:52:26 Doesn’t this assume crypto markets are rational? These days, token purpose and dynamics dont seem to reflect price. Take XRP for example
2545 2018-04-03 18:52:21 Notice me sempai. I need GPUs !
2546 2018-04-03 18:52:16 Damn we’re gonna miss them!
2547 2018-04-03 18:52:11 Well, if we assume that the hash function is sound, like we like to do, then we have actual lower bounds for hash based signatures. I guess it is trivial but here we go.
2548 2018-04-03 18:52:02 In crypto, you’re only as good as your last shitpost.
2549 2018-04-03 18:51:51 Confirmation points are often highly volatile  and cause whiplash in crypto though. What do you/peter think of buying pre-confirmation to avoid buying into volatility?

2561 2018-04-03 18:50:36 In crypto anybody can say they know what's gonna happen but 9.5 times out of 10 nobody knows. Look at xvg. It was at .005 for months, then McAfee put out 1 tweet and it mooned to over .27 USD. Look what XRP did and how fast. Imo we need a big name to promote htmlcoin.. @elonmusk
2562 2018-04-03 18:50:30 Intrigued I am.

2577 2018-04-03 18:49:19 You are probably looking at something generic and old. The authors have really optimized these numbers for specific architectures.

2582 2018-04-03 18:48:56 I think it is possibly the only piece of garbage I have owned in Crypto. Watched, from a distance, all the other garbage rise and fall. The Market is self purifying. The next bull run will see money pour in to the best projects, naturally. There was many, many billions tied up..

2591 2018-04-03 18:48:03 Created a Twitter account. Started reading about @Bitcoin. Wanted to invest in crypto currency but wanted something cheap. Started reading about some of the so called alt coins. Delved deep into @Ripple and #XRP then figured out how to buy XRP @ 0.20. Holding
2592 2018-04-03 18:48:02 I see the potential of top ten. @vergecurrency is in the verge of exponiential growth i think.If that partnership turns out to be as big as the #Vergecurrency people claim, that will be good for all crypto community as more use of #Vergecoin means more adoption of #crytpo

2595 2018-04-03 18:47:47 What is the guaranteed non-trivial lower bound? If there is any, someone is about to get the Fields medal and many other prizes for proving that P != NP.

2602 2018-04-03 18:47:17 Yes the best way to grow crypto is to use it transitionally.

2641 2018-04-03 18:43:22 Agree. But in this developing enviroment, it is very hard to be a good leader. If you follow a leader you are trusting him to understand what is happening and what is going to happen. Who knows this in crypto? @aantonop is a good leader, he encourages people to educate themselves
2642 2018-04-03 18:43:13 I have tweeted about crypto enough that many of the follow-unfollow bots have targeted me with wannabe "thought-leaders". Glad to see you in my mentions. Come for the keywords, stay for the funny kid stories.

2684 2018-04-03 18:39:35 I was just looking at gmp-mparam.h for various architectures, which gives cutoff points for various methods (in numbers of 64-bit words). The authors have done lots of optimization work. However for primes under 1000 bits it'd still classical mult.

2725 2018-04-03 18:35:17 you have made an assumption but have no proof to back your "theory" up as fact. It is possible the finance market could cause the exact opposite to your theory and cause a crypto pump... but this is also a theory without factual proof... so the point is who know what will happen.

Your expertise here, in the crypto arena are ultimately...irrelevant.

The price of TBC is directly attached to the true value of any currency—its base of users.

2797 2018-04-03 18:28:53 No, I mean finite field multiplication. Also, in a sense the actual complexity of integer multiplication is closer to O(k log k) than it seems in any case (think of the underlying hardware with ever larger registers).

2826 2018-04-03 18:25:05 Well, I've written these libraries and we ended up doing reduction and multiplication in one modmul loop and that was our Karatsuba cutoff point. Toom-Cook cutoff is somewhere high, can't remember where GMP chooses to use it, but is is waaay higher.

2829 2018-04-03 18:24:50 Pretty sure @ProfFaustus sees a world where EVERYTHING is on Bitcoin. So ETH is a competitor. Everything ETH does will be able to be done on Bitcoin Cash... including something like Crypto Kitties. The idea is that you don't need 1000 different coins. Just 1 that does everything

2846 2018-04-03 18:22:56 I beg to disagree. Karatsuba is useful for primes above 256 bits or so. I believe you mean Toom-Cook becomes useful for primes of that size?

2848 2018-04-03 18:22:51 For me: the price we ascribe to art and crypto-assets is a function of the value in-group members place on it. As a story, money is different altogether. There is no such thing as an out-group for money. We have other narrative concepts like death and god which behave similarly.

2900 2018-04-03 18:17:15 A good leader in crypto would be one that encourages people to lead  themselves. I think most recognized leaders right now don't that, and that is precisely why they are recognized leaders. They want to lead themselves and don't want you to.

2904 2018-04-03 18:16:57 How many of the unbanked have now bank accounts? How much economic freedom has spread? 90% of this community is focused on Hodling and lambos, if we don't personally advocate crypto for the poor & unfortunate then we as a community have failed in our goal, and the banks have won.
2905 2018-04-03 18:16:51 Right.. the asymptotic O(n log n) mult (or especially similar modular reduction) is not really usable for Elliptic curve arithmetic for primes of relevant size, which is really O(n^2). I think the cutoff point is somewhere much higher. Karatsuba becomes useful at about 2k bits.
2906 2018-04-03 18:16:29 So back to the question, I would define crypto, today, as a get rich quick scheme. There is no currency aspect about it, and it doesn't have earnings nor true scarcity to define it as an asset or commodity. It's fun to think about tho.
2907 2018-04-03 18:16:26 Making a plan and sticking with it won't eliminate the emotions, but with discipline, they become manageable since you're not taking action outside of the predefined parameters.
2908 2018-04-03 18:16:21 You are half the reason I love crypto
2909 2018-04-03 18:16:16 It's not on top of that, it's after that. So you add it instead of multiplying. And only if you want compressed key agreement (in which case pairings are the bottleneck, not DL).

2941 2018-04-03 18:13:28 Maybe if major #crypto publications would stop only covering the top "market cap" coins, they'd see the truly encouraging progress being made instead of panicking over valuation collapse of high hype projects. So many great projects moving their tech forward, not their marketing.
2942 2018-04-03 18:13:23 If you are making big bucks, u shouldnt be in the states for starters. EU still has no taxation on crypto money. #truestory
2943 2018-04-03 18:13:06 Of course the crypto community will win as long as ethereum hard forks making asic ethereum mining obsolete
2944 2018-04-03 18:13:03 Oh, one key thing to mention, right now because of crypto currency graphics cards and ram are super inflated, like 2x what they should cost. That's why many people are recommending prebuilts, because bundling discourages miners and gets gamers the "lower" prices on the gfx card

Dear Crypto elite, I am reaching out to you on a pledge that we cryptoworld community should plea to government of the world to let us to growth without fear, prejudes and negative action.
2947 2018-04-03 18:12:52 You should be skeptical of everything you read on #crypto Twitter. In this wild wild west new asset class, where scams & misinformation are prevalent, I expect everything I say to be scrutinized by skeptics. I don't blame you all one bit. 

I am the same way myself. No BS 
2948 2018-04-03 18:12:49 Yes, but the complexity of those formulas is that of multiplication, so the asymptotic complexity is still soft-cubic.
2949 2018-04-03 18:12:32 Well it was just the discrete log stuff that confused me. Scalar mult being cubic and then DL on top of that. But yeah, sorry.
2950 2018-04-03 18:12:25 How many A3s do you have? How many D3s do you have that are profitable?

2955 2018-04-03 18:12:06 I think it’d be a great idea if NEX can introduce an escrow system as an integration into the exchange. The crypto market badly needs a trusted escrow provider and if NEX could implement something like this it‘ll win all hearts hands down.

2960 2018-04-03 18:11:37 Agree. Life is painful. Kids should learn that before growing up. Trying to censor pain is cutting out some of the most meaningful experiences life has to offer. Live it, learn it, and appreciate your moments of success even more.

2967 2018-04-03 18:11:04 I saw this article because a friend commented on it on some Facebook pan-pagan group, and Freyja's dripping nipples, it brought out the crypto-fascists. I guess they're just way too eager to prove the article right.
2968 2018-04-03 18:11:03 My theory on the hype around crypto-currency & blockchain is that there basically hasn’t been a huge technological innovation in our society since smart phones/social media networks, and desperate capital/journalists/grifters desperately need the Next Big Thing

3020 2018-04-03 18:06:59 to renounce old beliefs or old allegiances.

3110 2018-04-03 17:59:43 Crypto, specifically bitcoin, is an attempt to issue a currency without the backing of any nation. I think it was a thought experiment. You can start to see the problems with that quickly tho. There's no store of value, seen in the desire for its value to go up so rapidly

3214 2018-04-03 17:48:04 $nano $xrb really seems like the future of crypto. Zero fees, how cool is that? Businesses pay a % to Visa/Mastercard/Amex for every transaction. If any crypto project can overcome it, it’s $nano. DYOR and you will surely be impressed.
3215 2018-04-03 17:48:00 With #VITO tokens, you can pay for credit card purchases, pay for VISO Shop purchases, pay for #VISO Shop services, use as a means for crediting and accumulating money in VISO Vallet and to sell VITO in the EXMO crypto currency market and in other markets.

3225 2018-04-03 17:47:24 possibly the thought is sinnce i was redirecting traffic away from medium. they have clear policy and they suspended. im okay with that.
3226 2018-04-03 17:47:15 Lol it needs it right now. Eth/btc pair is down trending
3227 2018-04-03 17:46:58 Just because there is volume doesn't mean anything.. xrp had a TON of volume, now look how many are holding losing positions. What it means is that you are following the pump. In crypto we are rewarded when we buy on low volume, before the hype train. You'll learn, hopefully

3331 2018-04-03 17:36:58 Gold spot price IS the futures market price.  This is not true of Bitcoin and this is the big difference.  Gold manipulation mechanism has been clearly demonstrated by others but you have not shown the mechanism for Bitcoin. They are not the same.

3336 2018-04-03 17:36:28 My summarized version?

Problem: Not owning our data because we don't our 'identity'
Solution: Own your identity and then link your data

Next step: Invoke P2P networking and pubkey crypto so you can share your data with TRUSTED parties.

3341 2018-04-03 17:35:48 Exactly. If the rumoured miner comes out with 1500 MH/s. It'll probably cost in region of 3k. 3k is the cost of 1 rig which will give about 200 MH/s. The cost difference is staggering
3342 2018-04-03 17:35:17 most of the lawyers that I have dealt w/ in my businesses are little bitches who think they know everything. I will NEVER do a Real estate deal w/ one ever again.

3344 2018-04-03 17:35:09 しかし、4/4までは下げ目線で、4/4からトレンド転換と言う、一週間くらい前からのテクニカル組の分析が大体合ってると思うと、テクニカルも意外と大切かもしれんのぅ…

3348 2018-04-03 17:34:33 Can confirm. I have a worthless piece of paper in marketing. Learned more in 3 months of my first job than I did in 4 years in college.
3349 2018-04-03 17:34:25 I wanna see some blood first and people screaming that crypto sucks. The $6.4k was nice but doesn't feel like the bottom. So you think different about that?
3350 2018-04-03 17:34:18 I haven't seen anyone get this rekt since @CarlosMatos80 had to admit to his wife that it was indeed..... a scam.....
3351 2018-04-03 17:33:56 @crypto_bobby Did the companies’ banning ads hurt crypto and #bitcoin, or did people’s reactions and fear of it do so? You’re right. There were lots of scams. I think it was a good move.

3356 2018-04-03 17:33:34 ビットコインは、ここからの戦略が難しいのぅ…結果的には、69万円弱のところが大底やったっぽいけど、あのチャートで見極めるのは無理やわ…
3357 2018-04-03 17:33:29 It’s a disaster. ETH will become a centralized crypto currency when this miner released!

he said in Feb the crypto market cap would be 250bn by mid March, was 2 weeks early, and a bit too low; end of march 260bn.
charted the drop VERY WELL.

3369 2018-04-03 17:32:01 I agreed with you! In my eyes Bitcoin is slowly dying and at the end of the year or at the beginning of 2019 something will replace bitcoin. And when that happens, it will be all over the news worldwide. What happens? People getting interested again and the hype is coming back.
3370 2018-04-03 17:31:59 Which is NOT worth the hype?

3390 2018-04-03 17:29:57 I started to talk about it when it was around 50 sats. went up more then 50% after that. Still holding it. The telegram is indeed amazing. Check it out yourself
3391 2018-04-03 17:29:48 they might need to do an ICO ;P
3392 2018-04-03 17:29:42 But won't crypto networks remain able to record your transactions from elsewhere? Isn't that the point of a decentralized open consensus network?
3393 2018-04-03 17:29:41 Follow this influential gentleman.

He will encourage you to #HODL only the best projects and considering we have suffered probably the least palatable crypto winter in existence always remains more than positive.

3394 2018-04-03 17:29:30 Weekly $BTC chart still bearish. This could very well be a deadcat bounce to $7,700-7,800 or up to $9k. The weekly close needs to be a bull reversal for this to last. If not, we could consolidate to low 6k or high 5k. Be careful here. #crypto #altcoins #altseason #Bitcoin

3400 2018-04-03 17:29:08 Maybe a stupid question.... still learning. But how do you get such a clear MACD chart (with the green and red)? The standard MACD indicator has a completely different layout in TradingView. I tried to change the format but it won't give me the result you are showing.
3401 2018-04-03 17:29:06 they asked some good traders to help test it out and give feedback and when u test it u get some extra info and you read their telegram and u find out that the project is kinda insane

3411 2018-04-03 17:27:47 Think about what you just said............. If the stock market crashes it effects EVERYONE'S fucking currency. If the US dollar goes then that's a huge chunk of worthless fiat that cannot go into crypto. For a businessman you're pretty stupid..........

3418 2018-04-03 17:26:22 People started getting rich, then said screw the poor and started courting institutional money trying recreate banking in crypto (lightning nodes) all in an effort to get rich/be a part of the 1% along with banks.  Sadly they are already acting the part calling people nocoiners.
3419 2018-04-03 17:26:10 You lost the reliability at customers

As a friendly advice look any other than Crypto

As market is seeing new firms and  compititors

To loose customers

This is financial sector and do better some good service....

3426 2018-04-03 17:25:23 I let both of you two do the talking. Then I buy as and when I want. Usually this means buying high and selling low. Isn't that the way it should be in crypto?

3474 2018-04-03 17:19:52 There's something like the 3rd Fibonacci wave is not always the longest but it is always the biggest and I'm pretty sure bitcoin is about to go through its 3rd wave according to the Twitter cryptp gods, which means bigger gains than the last crypto boom

独自取引所だからBTCの影響受けない理論は全く嘘だった笑
独自取引所という意味ではc0banも同じ理論言ってる人がいたけど同じく下がってるな。どんなものでも爆上げの後は暴落が来ると。

3499 2018-04-03 17:16:27 You may only need a couple people who read Sapiens to buy in and start talking about crypto to friends and then thise 2nd order people are like, “Oh, my smart friend whose reads stuff like Sapiens likes crypto now” and it spreads :)

3501 2018-04-03 17:16:10 My understanding is that it is in a commerce space which would explain traditional marketing. Never heard of Mind Geek so if its to appeal to a wider audience Im not sure how that would appeal. Also, what MASSIVE conglomerate would reach out to a small coin like Verge. Microsoft?
3502 2018-04-03 17:16:09 even worse, you cannot take multiple batches and add them together too prove randomness of a deck. You need to run 1,000,000 hands to measure a random deal, it shows how little experience you have in this market.

3508 2018-04-03 17:15:57 Question, why is a blockchain needed for that? Maybe just make a company tyat takes crypto as donations.

3521 2018-04-03 17:14:50 Here's how #Verge pumps their coin.

They come out with exaggerated news. Like "biggest partnership in crypto" or "Wraith!" They hype it up, ignoring self-made deadlines so they can repeat the hype cycle. Pay for articles. Pay for marketing. Pay for shills/bots.
3522 2018-04-03 17:14:48 The #SprintX team is well-known specialists in the web environment who are well aware of the subtleties of the #blockchain and the possibility of a successful launch of the platform. #SPTX #Ethereum #Crypto #BTC #ETH #BlockChain #ICO
3523 2018-04-03 17:14:44 What large twitter accounts? When $SUMO pumped from 0.30$ to 12.5$ no one wanted to mention it.Pretending it doesn't exist. Now its like two people, Have you seen what the team is doing? People take notice. Every $SUMO shill is well justified, everything else is jealousy.
3524 2018-04-03 17:14:41 Usually with you Andreas but this article is hot garbage mate. I have family and friends in Puerto Rico that are actually Puerto Rican. They are all excited by the idea of Crypto moving there and creating jobs. This article could’ve highlighted that but didn’t
3525 2018-04-03 17:14:38 Yeah, but it is good to know that if you jump from 128 bit security to 256 bit security, i.e. doubling your key size, you're going to get 30-50x performance hit, performance not 8x hit like with RSA privkey op when modulus is doubled.
3526 2018-04-03 17:14:31 En gros j’y vois des signes pour une suite de la baisse qui correspondrait bien au pattern bleu plutôt qu’une envolée des prix. Mais bon le marché a toujours raison 
3527 2018-04-03 17:14:27 Holy.  Shit.  Me too..

3529 2018-04-03 17:14:07 Seems as if Government crackdowns and investigations on those who are  a pure scam (Bitconnect) (Centra) will help the price recover in the long term besides its underlying technology aka BlockChain.Policing Crypto May not be a bad thing.
3530 2018-04-03 17:14:00 You need to explain this Clif. April should be up trend in crypto. What have change? I purchase you report all the time and this have not happend before. Please explain....thanks

3537 2018-04-03 17:12:16 using the histogram there is a bearish divergence for example when it tends from top to zero but price continues to rise, foreseeing an imminent inversion of trends, but it has gone above and below to 0 in 6 times

3615 2018-04-03 17:05:24 In a space filled with manipulation, how is tech analysis effective? Is it a matter of guessing what the whales and establishment will do next? I thought crypto was going to start removing elite and establishment interference of things

3633 2018-04-03 17:03:29 Well it's the optimized implementation supplied. Just please study the algorithms. They are in completely different polynomial complexity classes. RSA privkey is practically O(n)^3 and pubkey with small exp O(n)^2. SIDH is like O(n)^5 or more.

3664 2018-04-03 17:00:56 So it begins..
3665 2018-04-03 17:00:34 On my box SIKEp503 Encaps/Decaps are 71 / 75 ms, for SIKEp751 241 / 254 ms. RSA-2048 is 0.01 / 4.8 ms. So total end/dec speed RSA-2048 vs SIKEp751 is 100x. Of course RSA keygen is slow and it's not v goodfor  KEX. And SIKE is unsuitable, of course, for encryption / signature.

When I learned about this company, immediately decided that this is what I need, and having studied more details and deeper, I realized that was not mistaken with a choice, now I'm a customer and I recommend to everyone as well!
3749 2018-04-03 16:51:56 I got into crypto in November 2017. It all-of-a-sudden became all I wanted to think about. So, I changed my Twitter account to a crypto twitter. I've now tweeted 300 times, and even now, crypto is still all I want to think about most of the time.
3750 2018-04-03 16:51:54 Nah. That ain’t the editing’s fault. I’m just rough and choppy.
3751 2018-04-03 16:51:42 Q buen punto..
Hay aspectos de esta discusión que son muy absurdos. Como este reporte o q ante el miedo al anonimato de las transacciones crypto decidan eliminar a los únicos actores de la industria donde el anonimato no existe
3752 2018-04-03 16:51:34 Don't we hit bottom already. As the stock market crashes people will look to crypto. They want to make money too

Yes, there are a lot of unethical practices in banking too - but "no worse than the bankers" is a pretty low standard to hold ourselves to.

3820 2018-04-03 16:44:02 The crypto community likes to believe it's too intelligent to get co-opted, but if schmucks like Craig Wright can infiltrate, and rise to enough prominence to build a sizeable following and speak at conferences, you have to wonder what government spooks could achieve.
3821 2018-04-03 16:44:00 But, if they are 32% more random that others in dealing a fair deck of cards, does that mean that their decks are just better but not truly 100% random yet?

4024 2018-04-03 16:23:22 Stock market is already in a spin. Massive volatility and S&P 500 just holding 200ema. Keep trying to find a correlation between BTC and Dow. But if BTC van hold up under Dow pressure thats looks good for Crypto. FUD everywhere tho.

4064 2018-04-03 16:18:50 It WAS a crypto bubble. Market is now wading through its aftermath. Don't need mass adoption to have a bubble, but rather price to detach completely from fundamentals and animal spirits to explode.

4088 2018-04-03 16:16:14 Don't you think it is funny that $BTC promoters have started putting up log charts of the crypto after the price crashed 50%? And when the price was rising, all I saw was the price chart.  #psychology

4163 2018-04-03 16:09:57 What I really don't understand: Why does the biggest part of the "crypto people" prefer to be something "special", keep information in the scene instead of sharing the "secret" with everybody out there and boost the cryptos in that way? Just my two cents.
4164 2018-04-03 16:09:53 $XVG #Verge continues to make big gains, likely in anticipation of the upcoming partnership announcement. If the partnership brings mass adoption of the coin, especially outside of the usual crypto realm, $XVG has a chance to explode.
4165 2018-04-03 16:09:47 Excellent ICO. I have long been waiting for the release of a similar product

4167 2018-04-03 16:09:41 Almost all new people to #crypto are looking to accumulating coins with volume, meaning they will not be satisfied to own a coin which is below 1 for e.g 0.0X. That's why they avoid $btc. it's time we start to count in sat for btc so we avoid all these dumb 1trln supply pumps.

4170 2018-04-03 16:09:28 Contrast that with the average age group within crypto, who have limited life experience, a warped sense of reality, and a questionable ability to deal with adverse outcomes - you have a recipe for disaster. Such stressors could have catastrophic impacts on their lives.

4215 2018-04-03 16:03:04 All this is saying is that the the violence of downtrending is getting weaker (which is divergence yes). This is to be expected however in this case anyways, even before going deeper. It also happened in the previous bear market but it doesn't reverse until accumulation happens
4216 2018-04-03 16:03:00 I personally would never buy a coin unless I saw solid TA or fundamental news. A lot of "Alert" systems out there that just tell you to buy with no TA and just copy other alert groups. Make sure you always do your own research before investing! #Crypto #Bitcoin #Blockchain

4220 2018-04-03 16:02:31 Thanks for taking the time to address this.

Can you post the link so we can share & clear the fud
4221 2018-04-03 16:02:30 Ethereum is crashing as the ICO craze is clearly being exposed as an unsustainable gimmick. BCH's blocksize increase is just another gimmick. It does not add any utility that BTC didn't already have. Lightning on the other hand is a utility.
4222 2018-04-03 16:02:28 Well. He is. Sooo.
4223 2018-04-03 16:02:24 Interesting nothing is mentioned by politicians about the carbon, GHG, and Climate Change effects which Crypto Mining causes?
4224 2018-04-03 16:02:04 There's tons of places it can go before crypto. Especially since SEC regulations aren't implemented yet.

4232 2018-04-03 16:01:11 It's hard for the media to know what communities balls deep into crypto already know.
But this is also for those unsuspecting people who don't know about crypto but have heard of something called a Petro, so it really does serve a purpose.

2. BTC has reduced utility. I'm not claiming no utility. But I'm highlighting the more utility the more value. This is what made Ethereum so damn high value purely because of its utility in ICO generation.

4306 2018-04-03 15:54:58 Has conventional ever been the leader in the crypto world? Makes sense to me, Verge has no official piggy bank, no ico, no stash away. If a major partner was interested they would want to see that verge could at least afford its side of the deal.

4319 2018-04-03 15:53:31 My personal opinion with supported facts is that XRP is at approx 1600+% from April 3 of last year . There is market manipulation happening in the markets of crypto currently and late investors are feeling the pain of how investing works.

ICO and crypto are dealing with some heavy defiance currently, it's important to keep things as professional as possible ;)
4326 2018-04-03 15:52:49 Some will argue that is a sign of a bubble, however, I see it as investors know the potencial if crypto but are looking for "traditional" ways to invest

4397 2018-04-03 15:44:54 1. I think you mean "chink" as in referring to armor. 
2. To claim that Bitcoin has no utility is pretty brazen. It's clear that it's very useful, especially since the attackers have run out of money and the bad custodians were cowed by the public. BTC has more txs than BCH.

4444 2018-04-03 15:39:47 I hope $ltc gets more darknet market adoption but, I'm sticking with $xmr for that kind of shizzle.
4445 2018-04-03 15:39:44 Yesterday I saw a calculation for $XVG price prediction compared to $XRP MC on ATH. If $XVG would’ve been in top 3 then its price would’ve been $23. Wishfull thinking ofc, but with #crypto one never knows

4456 2018-04-03 15:38:58 Two things create value 1. Scarcity 2. Utility.

Without utility there is no store of value.

If something is useless it cannot by definition hold value. This is the chunk in Cores philosophy

4458 2018-04-03 15:38:44 Disagree !!! the only way to get your lambo is to understand the concept of the crypto , if you are not weeling to own a coin for 5 years, DO NOT think even owning it for 5 mnt. Cheers !!

4533 2018-04-03 15:32:21 Let me end with this: A serious crypto investor that plans to run a node should be able to rent and set up a vps.

4642 2018-04-03 15:19:34 I'm not so sure about that. The internet and web use the same protocols, because of network effect. People use the same money, because of network effect. Crypto is both money and protocol. Why support many when you can converge and build on one?

4658 2018-04-03 15:18:06 Well that's the endgame of any minable crypto. Expensive GPU's ruined it for CPU miners, ASICs are the next step. The only difference is that cost has increased each time. It was bound to end up a commercial operation from the start.

Bitcoins original vision is electronic cash.

4857 2018-04-03 14:59:20 My main issue with ETH is that they are SV style SJW Marxists which is simply the pigs from Animal Farm. They have no problem with censoring anything that is beyond center right. Crypto is supposed to free dependence on institutions not make new masters.

4886 2018-04-03 14:56:38 This is patently false.  The biggest, best connected hubs... will be businesses, due the very nature of customers connecting to them.

4982 2018-04-03 14:46:37 Historically Q2 is the start of a Bull run for Crypto, lets see if that’s the case this year.
4983 2018-04-03 14:46:29 This is a good example however the US is only 10% of the crypto market. Would love to see where we are at compared to world adoption of technology. I would assume its close but you know what happens when you assume.
4984 2018-04-03 14:46:24 That's rich.  90% of these projects are in their first year or 2.

How many decades (centuries?) have central banks been failing their stated goals, and instead simply been enriching the lives of the few?

5072 2018-04-03 14:39:14 in ten years crypto could be the dominant form of currency used around the world. it may not be worth what it is now though, could be more or less, but it’s pretty obvious some form of digital currency is going to exist that everybody uses.

5120 2018-04-03 14:35:44 The main idea behind this product is to offer our clients the possibility to switch immediately from Crypto Products into the PGC when the market is starting to drop and switching  Crypto Products when the market starts to go up!

Our token’s revolutionary strategies of “Buy Pressure” and “Strategic Scarcity” create perfect conditions for our cryptocurrency to thrive.
5129 2018-04-03 14:35:20 The ultimate target is that we won't need to sell it for $ anymore. But I'd start thinking about selling most of my BTC when it rises too quickly to a level where I can retire and buy one house or two apartments in my city. Even then I'd keep a moon-bag and probably BTFD.

5135 2018-04-03 14:34:43 I agree that risks and the affected population have exponentially increased. It's quite something to see investor psychology repeating 5yrs later.  Hopefully we won't get REKT - and that's why I twitted the comparison, perhaps awareness will blunt the effect of repetition
5136 2018-04-03 14:34:33 Remember when he got pissed off because of lambo memes and sharting? I hadn't been aware that sharting had ingratiated itself so firmly into crypto parlance. But i hopped on that train stat.
5137 2018-04-03 14:34:33 I said in general not directly to him but in crypto community mostly everybody thinks they are the best and call others noob or dumb or such. This is quite sad such a pity.

5269 2018-04-03 14:25:40 PS: the reason I am tweeting about this. One thing I like about XRP/Ripple is the substance and fundamentals,  the reasoning of the XRP army. We are all taking a risk, but at least it iss calculated. When I see tweets like these, it impacts the crediblity of the token and crypto.

5298 2018-04-03 14:23:31 Yes i think ETs or simply more advanced and smarter humans might nudge us towards gold/crypto hybrid solution.  This combo truly makes a lot more sense than just using one exclusively over the other.  Also I think many are not fully aware of the true reasons why gold has value.

5313 2018-04-03 14:22:26 We are always open for the ideas. But what is the marketing for the crypto currencies. It is not the classical marketing where you do ads.

5326 2018-04-03 14:21:30 If it drops, it does so towards the nearest resistance turned support line. On a 4H chart it is around 670 sats. Also - the hint that price may go down is that it did not move up much, because there is resistance at 860-870 sats since Feb 17

One of my favorite indicators for crypto projects is non-greedy founders. 

Unsurprisingly, the earlier crypto projects had a higher non-greedy quotient. Bear markets increase the quotient too.

They will overtake a huge marketcap. But sure, you can make fun of people who want to spread huge investment opportunities

5478 2018-04-03 14:06:18 So true......

It’s a great project, and you’re right, it’s not getting out there at the rate of knots as others. I think this is a good thing, building a solid foundation. 

The partnership with ‘Unity’ is without doubt a massive coup, as I’m not a trader, I’m more than happy.

5482 2018-04-03 14:05:14 Hi, I do understand your point but this is clearly an attack on crypto. You can use credit card for online casino. There are even atm's in casino where you can use credit cards. So this isnt about protecting custommers, they want to make it harder.
5483 2018-04-03 14:05:13 I use this Twitter account just for #Crypto Funny how all the ads pushed to me are banking adverts. I block them all.

5546 2018-04-03 13:59:52 Centralized data is the reason that Facebook came to be worth ~$500B.

Decentralized data will be the reason that the #crypto asset class will reach well into the trillions.

Data is now the world's most valuable resource, and crypto is primed to capitalize.

Hi, Can you kindly share your thoughts on how cryptocurrencies will behave in an economic recession. Will it be like gold going up or like stocks going down. I think recession is around the corner...
5554 2018-04-03 13:58:50 I run my own businesses. I make my own money.
But thanks for asking.

5564 2018-04-03 13:57:36 Fed injects liquidity into the markets and the excess flows into crypto is my theory. Maybe it is anticipating a bottoming process with the DOW as liquidity may start flowing there causing that market to rise soon.

5568 2018-04-03 13:57:09 Step 1: do your own research. Step 1.5: asking other people on twitter is not good enough research to base an investment on. It can be supplementary in order to find new info, but u must back it up by other sources.
Step 3: yes; it's a good time now before the market goes back up

5603 2018-04-03 13:52:44 Pour être honnête ses réticences sont fondé mais la vérité est que la crypto monnaie va changer le système en entier et ça risque d’être inconfortable pendant un bout de temps. Ça vaut totalement le coup ;)
5604 2018-04-03 13:52:43 See, this is what happens. You guys find a way to ignore massive run ups that are and have taken place...

5618 2018-04-03 13:51:14 95% of internet crypto guru’s are a scam. But I follow them to know the crowd sentiment
5619 2018-04-03 13:51:13 #xrp seems against what crypto currencies are striving for.A small group(#Ripple) control 60% of the coins and they released the other 40% to the masses.Only "trusted" nodes can verify transactions, trusted by who?.With that kind of power they can pretty much control theprice.
5620 2018-04-03 13:51:04 Last comment... I think #crypto markets are suffering from a supply issue... The supply of #HODLers versus the supply of #crypto available... One of the ways of fixing that balance is a correction... Sometimes It takes frequency or depth to rebalance things for another bull run..
5621 2018-04-03 13:51:02 for sure newcomers will dump for a 60% gains...

5695 2018-04-03 13:40:17 Hi Dan. No this was for L. I don't get what he means by PoW would lead to extremely expensive storage. Why would it do that. How would it do that. Unlike asic and GPUs HDD is easy to make and they can make more if there is demand. 8tb year ago was $300 or more today it's $189.
5696 2018-04-03 13:40:09 I think the birth of ICO’s hasn’t helped the crypto market at all especially if people have invested and the ICO has failed and it’s prolonged this bear run
5697 2018-04-03 13:39:56 Is #PoWH3D the honest version of #Bitconnect? Again its sounds too good to be true but the decentralized idea of this pyramid scheme makes it tempting to try it. #crypto #news #powh #platform

5710 2018-04-03 13:38:14 Keep in mind that by declaring Trader Tax Status, this converts you trading activities into Self Employment, making them subject to 15.3% self employment tax, in addition to ordinary income tax.  What if the Crypto Market has a Bull run before year end.  Very expensive error.

5764 2018-04-03 13:33:56 The 200 and 50 day Moving Average is used in traditional markets that trade 5 days a week.. so 200 day MA is 5 days x 40weeks.. which is 1 year. Crypto trading is 24/7/365 so those dont really apply so strongly

5813 2018-04-03 13:29:38 Hopefully once bull run starts. Still not sure about crypto as barring btc/lTC everything else looks like a bubble. Hadn’t they gone through ICO I would have had more faith as the projects are good. All the alts are like we hate banks and hey give us some fiat for some tokens.
5814 2018-04-03 13:29:38 Why would the creator of Bitcoin willingly paint a target on his back for every world government threatened by Bitcoin?

Much better to appear as a fraud imo.

5816 2018-04-03 13:29:33 And a bubble with btc 100k would be as big as dotcom bubble. This bubble popping would definitely take 1-2 years for recovering. Like 2014. Consider that pattern. It could also be a huge mistake when we are all bearish. btc 20k and crypto 800billion is nothing. as big as apple
5817 2018-04-03 13:29:32 C'est dommage que les échos soient si peu informés, d'habitude y a du bon contenu, mais bon, la crypto pour eux c'est né en fin 2017, faut être indulgent x)

By definition of the word "religion," that which binds, religion has created human groupings.  US identity is of melting pot, microcosm of the globe, as such. Does it fly?

5847 2018-04-03 13:26:42 This was a scam ICO... good that they've been stopped! I invested initially, but got out very soon as soon as some of the shady stuff started emerging (e.g. founders' photos were of other people, criminal records, etc.)

5854 2018-04-03 13:26:26 What people don't realize is that if this partnership enables the utilization of $XVG as a mainstream payment option. And that payment has the option of being private...It will be the most legitimized crypto to date. $XVG will bring new money in!
5855 2018-04-03 13:26:25 You and @PatWielandLIVE YouTube video taught a “common man” what this crypto thing is. Your knowledge and passion for the $DGB project have opened my eyes and... my wallet into something to believe in within the crypto community.
5856 2018-04-03 13:26:21 Development is still in its infancy and many tests are still to come. From speaking to various people around London, majority think "they have missed the boat" 
So the perception is from the general public is to make quick money not knowing what #Crypto intended use is for.

5865 2018-04-03 13:25:12 I find the term “virtue signaling” is over used by the self appointed  morality police in crypto. If people interjecting their morality when discussing crypto related matters  makes you so uncomfortable, 1) mute them, 2) discover why it makes you feel so uncomfortable (guilt?).

5887 2018-04-03 13:23:13 How to be a crypto journalist guide:

Wait for some prominent personality to write a post or propose a change

Copy the entire thing, paste it onto an article. Write the same thing in slightly different language as 'your thoughts'

Say this news can improve the price of crypto.
5888 2018-04-03 13:23:13 Basically the answer to every question is: “It’s unclear...”. Article should be returned to: OFAC claims they’ll add new SDN crypto list, however, it’s unclear how.

6044 2018-04-03 13:14:12 Kringles are the smallest change of the crypto-currency TBC.  

0.00000001 TBC = 1 Kringle.  

The way you can calculate the conversion of Kringles into TBC is by dividing the Kringles by 100,000,000 to get the TBC equivalent.  100,000 Kringles divided by 100,000,000 = 0.001 TBC.

6087 2018-04-03 13:11:18 I just wondered: If websites use #webminers for mining #crypto does that make the browser/client/user make a #miner or is the website the mining part? If mining is regulated/prohibited in the user's country, visiting some websites could have disastrous results.
6088 2018-04-03 13:11:16 We are not out of the woods just yet.  Position yourselves and accumulating will be the winning strategy.  Fundamentally, crypto has never been stronger.  Positive vibes to everyone in this space.  #bitcoin #cryptocurrency #coinbase
6089 2018-04-03 13:11:04 I do believe BCH is Satoshi's vision, however, the way you guys go about marketing it will make it fail regardless. Why attacking BTC or ETH constantly? Crypto is about collaboration, not competition. That's is why BCH has no place in the market. Thank god we still have XMR.

6122 2018-04-03 13:08:06 multiday fasting is the way to do it!
6123 2018-04-03 13:07:51 b365 and Sky Bet
6124 2018-04-03 13:07:29 That's freakin awesome. The large gold chain and oversized collar really seals the deal
6125 2018-04-03 13:07:28 this is te next big thing in crypto
6126 2018-04-03 13:07:24 Most not even close to 50% accurate. With respect to btc, clearly TA is a measured guess. Impossible to chart a supply owned by 5%. Whales moves in schools. Moreover, btc sneezes FUD, weak hands assume it’s the plague. Just be ready when it moves. Over 12,5...we gone
6127 2018-04-03 13:07:23 2) However as stated I like fasting. I just don't like to see bad arguments used to promote good practice.
6128 2018-04-03 13:07:21 Heard that a few days ago
6129 2018-04-03 13:07:18 1) A lot of the points are definitely untrue, or at the very least intellectually dishonest. 

Reving up the metabolism, the amount of extra calories burned are miniscule and would have no effect on fat loss. 

Increasing growth hormone transiently has no tangible benefit.
6130 2018-04-03 13:07:07 indeed a good thing as it will help to quiet the detractors who claim crypto is all about fraud, money laundering and terrorism.

6133 2018-04-03 13:06:57 Actually yes. Crypto is in one of the biggest secular bull markets in mankind and is finally getting adoption. Try to time a cyclical bear at your own risk

6152 2018-04-03 13:05:13 I love how to your bearish eyes everything is going according to plan and to my bullish eyes everything is going according to plan lmao. Watching these levels carefully, though. Bears will load up on shorts and timid bulls will take profits.

6167 2018-04-03 13:02:12 I think the problem lies that people look at how many trillion are available, yet not understanding that 60% is in lockdown for in app rewards. 
As soon as they get the understanding what ‘Unity’ can bring to the project, it’s a lot less daunting an investment.

6175 2018-04-03 13:01:19 I read your initial report on the bitcoin cartel theory. Since it's happened to gold and silver and it's now happening to bitcoin. Does that mean bitcoin will be suppressed for a few years like silver and gold have been?

6180 2018-04-03 13:00:44 That's a pretty rough chart, and if you put it next to the ETH/USD chart, you'll see that it correlates about as much as the overall crypto market does. I'm specifically looking for proof that the demand for ETH was driven by the demand for ICOs.
6181 2018-04-03 13:00:31 There’s apparently some discussion in the old world (politicians, legacy investment funds) whether crypto is a utility, security or commodity. What a new category - cryptocurrency? (BTW it is designed to replace many parts of the old world). Wake me up when they decide. Or not.

6192 2018-04-03 12:59:28 6) In the end fasting is simply one option for managing your diet. You may find it practically easier to fit your schedule. That is all. It has no other tangible benefits.

6194 2018-04-03 12:59:21 Intermittent fasting works by increasing time spent in low insulin state.  True.  However a person that calls herself Dr and a functional neurologist but is really a chiropractor is a fraud.
6195 2018-04-03 12:59:19 5) The growth hormone secretion increases are transient and have little no no effect on body composition.
6196 2018-04-03 12:59:09 4) Metabolism is the sum collective of all processes in the body, that is simply what the metabolism is. Eating, being active, doing stuff will have more of an effect on transiently increasing metabolism.

6198 2018-04-03 12:58:55 3) As an example 'revs up the metabolism'. You know what else revs up the metabolism? 

Eating.
6199 2018-04-03 12:58:50 Crypto is a great example of selling confidence. In fact, that's all crypto is since there is nothing tangible behind it. As long as everyone is confident, it goes up. It's the big money people who get paid by sewing the seeds of non-confidence so they can buy cheap.
6200 2018-04-03 12:58:47 2) The article itself is quite overblown and takes a lot of the research out of context. I don't really like articles like this because in presenting an exaggerating version of a sensible concept, it hurts rather than helps.
6201 2018-04-03 12:58:47 Still remember when 4 months ago every churro food truck was adding $3 billion to its market cap after announcing a pivot to crypto

6258 2018-04-03 12:52:46 Arguing on twitter is like playing chess against a pigeon. You might be good at chess, but at some point during the game, the pigeon is going to step on the board, crap on it, and pump his chess like he's a champion. #crypto #bitcoin #arguing #Debating #Twitter

6264 2018-04-03 12:51:36 Si estás esperando a que el market cap suba 25-30% para sentir seguridad y mejorar tus posiciones o comprar crypto por primera vez...vas a invertir demasiado tarde.

6321 2018-04-03 12:46:39 It was around about this time of year in 2014 when I was introduced to crypto after an article on the 2013 Bitcoin pump after the crash.

Did some research and bought before the $Doge pump, then the $kitteh pump with @jebus911 then the @CoinBlack pump.

2014 was epic!!

6395 2018-04-03 12:38:02 But Bitconnect is a ponzi scheme and was always obviously such, therefore your analogy is nonsensical.

6409 2018-04-03 12:35:52 That's like asking to prove that bitconnect was not a ponzi. If you don't understand how easy it is to sign a cryptographic message using the private key, you might as well shut up and start learning.

6423 2018-04-03 12:34:14 Another POS ICO similar to a private placement. "Great for the ones collecting the ICO funds." They get $$ for a crypto #. You lose $$ for an ICO you have zero control over.

6434 2018-04-03 12:32:36 I have. You randomly claim that XRP ‘will never be a crypto’ because it is centralised. Do you care to back up your reasoning? Or are you unable to and just parroting something you heard somewhere?

6440 2018-04-03 12:31:57 I've not seen it. Vast majority are undisclosed, and the projects themselves make no stipulations that it has to be disclosed. Maybe people just don't realise because they're not experienced with it at all, but it's definitely serious now with more eyes on $crypto than ever.

6457 2018-04-03 12:29:16 A personal opinion is it doesn't matter what #Crypto is worth so long as different tech can improve quality of life where required. Yes I got my #Bitcoin from mining a long time ago and its nice to see it has a value. But does not change the fact of how I see money. Not bothered.

6659 2018-04-03 12:00:29 I don't agree with you on this, Vitalik. I think crypto-economics could promote and hold people accountable, this could be more than internet and ICE. Internet and ICE  empowered people, Cryptos could make good people, that's why it becomes a religion.
6660 2018-04-03 12:00:19 Big companies and investors are waiting for stability and reliability for them to buy in crypto. For now I believe they are watching closely specially if regulations are set then thats the time we will see the market to move.

6681 2018-04-03 11:59:25 @cryptomanran @RonnieMoas these are my 2 most respected crypto’s guru’s. 

When both go back into the market and invest in crypto this is my buy signal. Even if this is not the bottom, it’s close enough. Onwards and upwards
6682 2018-04-03 11:59:24 Simple solution is for the U.S. to only tax the fiat/crypto onramp/offramp...allow purchases with crypto to go untaxed (except the typical sales tax).

Otherwise the flow of crypto will simply go everywhere else...
6683 2018-04-03 11:59:09 If stocks are going back up, that must mean crypto is going to tank again.
6684 2018-04-03 11:59:06 Excellent technology and concept. Many advantages at one place. I really love your work,This project in the future will be very helpful in the world of crypto. Hopefully this project is successful...

6694 2018-04-03 11:57:44 Yes; that stupid cartel conspiracy is just sloppy thinking. Never attribute to a centralized conspiracy what can be explained by a confluence of interests or incentives across non-connected parties.

6758 2018-04-03 11:47:28 I disagree. Financial markets are often correlated. A failing stock market will put even more stress on crypto markets.

Les etats tiers (les 1.0 en retard) ne pourront plus empecher. Donc course à la crypto qui va encore plus mettre la tete sous l'eau de ceux qui restent 1.0

6954 2018-04-03 11:21:55 Neither Tezos or EOS exist. They have some testnets running, but that's about it. But as said, short term price is irrational, and most people really can't assess these assets objectively. Reality is that crypto only has two serious players: Ethereum and Bitcoin.

6984 2018-04-03 11:18:03 It obviously all depends on where you reside and the implying tax laws, however converting crypto to anything else could still trigger a taxable event, realising that profit. Hence @APompliano ‘s tweet is spot on wrt to confusion as to how it needs to be treated.

7004 2018-04-03 11:14:48 We're not at the point of convincing non-crypto merchants to take the very big leap of faith into accepting crypto. First increase crypto accepting merchants to accept $MUE, then build from there with growing resources and support. That's the plan.
7005 2018-04-03 11:14:22 I agree that the cap wont always decide the price of the coin.  But if Tron wants massive growth $ .25 - .50 + I believe the market cap will have to grow.  We will need more money in the crypto space.

システム1は、直感的に判断、自動的に高速で動く思考。赤い標識を注意警告と判断とか。
システム2は、システム1の後にゆっくり動き、物事を慎重に判断・計算する思考。数学の複雑な計算式、難解な文章の理解とか。

"Crypto-collateralized stablecoins are the perpetual motion machines of modern finance."

Well said.

Stable coins are stable until they're not; most likely ending spectacularly. But yes, I'd prefer a free market blockchain pursuit of "stability" over a govt one.

7230 2018-04-03 10:46:33 thanks for this, Jo. the main question I have: can we really expect the current UCU leadership to behave as you suggest following a No, given their ahem track-record in this dispute? not much faith or trust in the architects of crypto-capitulation (HEC hijinks, etc)
7231 2018-04-03 10:46:30 amazon would also mean Twitch and that would mean a younger audience involved in crypto and way more publicity because of all the streamers. That wouldn't be so bad :)

7303 2018-04-03 10:37:08 Frankly, I don't see how any crypto can survive the Deflationary Collapse that's now started. If there's people who like a speculative gamble, there's probably a while left yet before it really starts to bite, but as the old rule of thumb says, don't speculate with more than 10%
7304 2018-04-03 10:37:00 #fortysevenbank, #gofortyseven deserves the attention of experts. With the development of crypto-economy, there is a need for cryptobanks, which will undoubtedly be in demand.

7451 2018-04-03 10:18:11 These two links enable merchants to accept $MUE.
If merchants are unable to implement, they won't be able to accept MUE or any other crypto.  Very similar to integrating PayPal or credit card check out.  What do you suggest?
7452 2018-04-03 10:18:09 Isn't deep onion the ultimate privacy coin?
7453 2018-04-03 10:17:50 I think the risk with coinbase is also government intervention. Anyway, sure exchanges have good uses. And custodians will have a place in crypto as well. But I do see everyone having their own wallet. We just need to improve the user experience to be more intuitive.

7568 2018-04-03 10:03:00 Keep in mind, they can only read your public address and check the balance on the ledger. Creating a trust line opens your acct to trade in that currency. Nothing more or less.  It may be a test of more to come with building off of the ledger. Will it slow XRP?

7578 2018-04-03 10:02:21 10+ years ago I was also diagnosed of Hodgkin's Lymphoma (3rd stage cancer). I was still a kid back then but managed to pull through by being positive and with the help of my friends and family.

Happy to see another Cancer Victor in Crypto twitter, @alistairmilne! Kudos.
7579 2018-04-03 10:02:18 All I know in a crypto transaction is probably an address.  Who do I sue?  Who do I subpoena to discover the identity behind that address?

7603 2018-04-03 09:59:16 Is bull market starting ?
Probably not !
What is the best strategy ?
Put half your crypto's in bitcoin and half in tether. If bull market starts bitcoin will grow first and you will be in profit in fiat & if bearish market continues you will be bitcoin rich !
7604 2018-04-03 09:59:09 Still plenty of crypto millionaires to come with the next generations. Just don't expect you can be lazy and get rich quick.

7701 2018-04-03 09:40:37 RCIに関しては、ツイートした記憶があります。
RCIは、チャートに先駆けて上昇/下降することが多いです。
上昇するときは、RCI3LINEの短期線/中期線GC、下降はDCが先に来るパターンが多いです。
ただ、確度がどの程度なのかは確認してませんね・・・。

7965 2018-04-03 08:54:47 If you believe in the future of crypto then overlay your belief over market cycles. Markets are cyclical and toggle between greed and fear, over sold and overbought. Q4 2017 was a clear “overbought”. Now decide whether you believe we are in fear and oversold territory yet.
7966 2018-04-03 08:54:44 If you've ever been in a situation where you hold ETH but wish you had BTC or you simply want to exchange one crypto-asset for another, then you need @ShapeShift_io. It's an exchange that seamlessly exchanges one crypto for another

8001 2018-04-03 08:50:12 The crypto world is way too cryptic. Made by devs for devs. How can we even dare to ask people deal with huge cryptic addresses? FYI: It took banks 2 yrs to explain their users what an IBAN is (Even though its just their Bank Code+ Account no.) Time for change. #nagawallet #ngc

8045 2018-04-03 08:42:25 Here is a hint; how to handle crypto Gurus:

- Be kind to them
- Don’t be pushy
- Try to read their time line
- Participate more
- Comments are must to grab their attention
- Gurus like the likes 
- they move retweets 
- they are working hard so appreciate that 
- they are humans
8046 2018-04-03 08:42:23 Centra provided payments via a VISA card. That's a banking connection and not just software. That's why the SEC is involved. Simple.

I agree that regulators should leave crypto alone generally, but when a bank is involved, things are different.

8168 2018-04-03 08:24:10 1) The democracy-plutocracy debate in crypto is inevitable and will likely be highly interesting. It has been largely avoided for a long time, because it's PR dynamite and there is little financial incentive to explore it.

8174 2018-04-03 08:23:02 Completely agree. Don't think crypto is a magic bullet by any means but do think it may hold some potential to provide a basis for a just, decentralized monetary system. Aware it could create something just as bad but think the potential is worth pursuing.

8230 2018-04-03 08:12:01 Big wall of sell orders at 7450 if it can’t get past that good if not back down to 6k

競合相手を狂いそうなほど嫉妬させるために、どんな商品の特徴やサービスを加えることができるだろうか。

8235 2018-04-03 08:11:20 I always feel like an expert when my portfolio goes +10%. Masterfully forgetting it went -80% this year :D
8236 2018-04-03 08:11:17 To disagree with monetary policies (debt, private banks credit multiplier, lack of accountability when doing QE or inflation) is sane and good. They need reform.
I still fail to see how replacing banks by crypto is not pure techno-utopia, as in “software instead of instutitions”.

8244 2018-04-03 08:10:19 $btc şuan sağlam bir dirençte 7400-7500 bandını  hacimli aşarsa 7800e yol alacaktır. Şuan hacim eksik gibi. Ama parça parça yükselmesi yinede umut veriyor. Buralarda çok dolanırsa tekrar 7000 e düşecektir. #altcoin ler zaten dünden beri hazırlık içerisinde.

8252 2018-04-03 08:09:32 That's +$30B in 2 days #CoinMarketCap  , still a long way to create some hype as most newspapers only publish 'bad' news on #crypto. Still believe #crypto is a great thing to invest for the 'normal' people.
8253 2018-04-03 08:09:29 More a rant .. I guess people are now trying to make a sense of the relationship between money / currency / debt means in the bigger picture as we move into #crypto world.
8254 2018-04-03 08:09:24 No worries you should have access now. Crypto is now open to everyone. Or you mean the US waiting list? No acces to withdraw initially to cold storage (poss future release) however I understand they use a 3rd party who cold store.
8255 2018-04-03 08:09:06 Blockchainウォレットの便利なところはクラウドだったこと。
同じBTC財布をiPadからでもパソコンからでも見られました。

8269 2018-04-03 08:06:59 Withdrawals don’t push volume irrelevant, purchases do @RevolutApp use a 3rd party for direct crypto purchase. Enough purchases = enough volume = price effected. May or may not as Revolut are relatively new but just pointing out don’t confuse buying volume with wallet withdrawals
8270 2018-04-03 08:06:44 You made a call on a 8% gain in crypto? Am I misunderstanding something?
8271 2018-04-03 08:06:32 Crypto prices are unpredictable by nature. Hurify ICO happened when ETH was at $1300 and HUR was $0.14. Now ETH is at $385. Hurify is positioned for long term strategic growth and the free market will decide the price of Hurify as Hurify launches on Main net shortly.

Because most have no idea how to navigate the “Markets” successfully, right?  

Who benefits from a Crypto-currency that is traded on an “Exchange?”  

The people that own the “Exchange” is the correct answer!

Their claims are:
1. The Pirl Team supports the rumored ethash ASICs
2. There is a "hidden premine" in PIRL

Both of these statements are inequivically false.

8541 2018-04-03 07:24:59 My guess is xPool could be to do with insuring RippleNet transactions against the single biggest crypto problem (market volatility) by creating a liquidity pool (i.e. 'a small area of still water') that everything flows into and out of. Lending zerps to xPool could make this work

8772 2018-04-03 06:46:53 Funny how someone can talk shit about others knowing nothing about their positions. Why be in tsla or crypto when you can be making more elsewhere? The biggest fool is always the stubborn person in the room.

8799 2018-04-03 06:39:34 It's hard to say, depends on the overall market.  If crypto as a whole has a sustained bear trend, then 7-10.  If either A) the overall market rebounds or B) strong $alts finally decouple from $BTC, then 40-50 may be in play.

8807 2018-04-03 06:36:46 Lisa, let me smell your hair.
8808 2018-04-03 06:36:45 Unfortunately Bitcoin is the ‘reserve’ currency of the crypto world for many reasons. Meaning that whenever it moves the whole market tends to follow it. Hopefully we can see this BTC dominance and market correlation fizzle out by the end of this year... Most manipulated $$?

the bears are fighting hard and the MSM still like to FUD, but in the long term we will win them over - and, weirdly enough, we need them to make crypto stronger - remember:

Rule No. 177. Know your enemies...but do business with them always.

I live here, and it’s not exactly crypto friendly actually than whats seen in the media.

Banks/central banks are prettt anti-crypto. Accounts of exchanges will get shut down

And yup, most are still living in 2015. It’s all about Blockchain not bitcoins

9044 2018-04-03 05:57:04 Real trustworthy market making is about public transparent contracts between maker and exchange with all KPIs being public: volume, spread, orderbook quality etc. If there's any example of that maker in crypto?
9045 2018-04-03 05:57:03 クリプトはファンダ（コインチェック買収）もテクニカル（2月最安値ライン手前で反転）も現在は良好。やっと風向きが変わってきたような感じはある。まだエントリーには早すぎると思いますが。
株の方は相変わらず方向が不透明。中長期ではそろそろヤバそうな雰囲気なのでプットオプションを準備中。

9140 2018-04-03 05:40:57 In traditional Blockchains adding more nodes to a network decreases throughput but with Zilliqa's sharding mechanism the number of transactions actually increases in line with the number of nodes added. They are also reaching throughput without compromising security
9141 2018-04-03 05:40:53 Ether (ETH) is the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, the second largest capitalization on the crypto market.

9155 2018-04-03 05:38:57 No one said $trx would be hundreds of dollars.  To pass $eth TRON needs to be about $1.00.  TRON will have an easier time going 10x than eth will have to just double.

9159 2018-04-03 05:38:00 Yes this was interesting 40-50 central banks talking / testing Ripple. The major problem XRP solves is the massive value tied up in Nostro accs. that can be reduced if not totally freed up. No other crypto can do this. It is the most efficient medium to trans. X border payments
9160 2018-04-03 05:37:48 I’ve said multiple times that everyone should be highly skeptical of the binance leadership team that does business with the blatant criminals in Malta. The crypto community cheered for the financial freedom but it simply shows binance will do whatever is necessary when needed

9274 2018-04-03 05:17:31 Actually, it is you who says it. not @fordnation and @OntarioPCParty .  Are you a crypto liberal by any chance?
9275 2018-04-03 05:17:28 No it will go to 3k - banks won't jump on board until it's dirt cheap and we need new money for it to explode..... sadly
9276 2018-04-03 05:17:25 So that means everyone will think that btc is going lower which means they are going to pump it and create some FOMO.

9400 2018-04-03 04:54:38 I am positive because i am surrounded by positive people and being negative doesnt help. Happiness depends on the quality if the thoughts. How much money we put inside for the investment for me is not worth the real investment we put on ourselves as a person.

9404 2018-04-03 04:53:42 Just counted how much im down in crypto this year, i wonder how people around me are taking it.
9405 2018-04-03 04:53:35 This is your project?
9406 2018-04-03 04:53:20 It's like crypto, you HAVE to tell the people or else they will ignorant and happy and we can't have that.
9407 2018-04-03 04:52:59 @VitalikButerin Destroys the market. Ethereum is performing terribly against other crypto these days because we have had nothing
But bad news lately, IE: Fees, fake hard caps, ICO bans (this ones not your fault). ALL I'm saying is, please realize that this is REAL people's money
9408 2018-04-03 04:52:55 If you read IBMs site about that product, it's truly terrifying. They plan to create "crypto-trackers" and put them in everything. Of course they say it's to ensure medicines are genuine etc., but it doesn't take a genius to see it's an extension of copyright totalitarianism.
9409 2018-04-03 04:52:51 ohhhh look who the cat dragged in!!!!

9410 2018-04-03 04:52:46 そうなんですか。価値観を他者に強要することがよくないと思いますが、「ビーガンにはそういう人が多い」って認識の方が多いんですね。個人的にはそんなに強要された経験はないので勝手にやってくれ〜という感じでしたが（うさんくさいとは思うけど）。

9445 2018-04-03 04:45:27 I’m starting to believe the actual reason total market cap plummeted so much is because of credits card companies heavily throttling our crypto purchases. Credit AND Bank cards are being declined by the issuer. Zero new money is able to replace weak OLD money.

9473 2018-04-03 04:39:13 Feels like a good spot to scale out of my $BTC position.

Will buy-back if we get a decent/healthy pull-back.

Will likely open a short around $7.5k as a hedge or perhaps just sell the remainder. Depends on the action if/when we get there.

9528 2018-04-03 04:32:03 Ripple got 7,5,8.5,10,0,10,6 = 46.5
Gridcoin got 7,5,3,10,8,5,8 = 46

And somehow you actually write that Gridcoin got a 6.9 while Ripple got a 6.6....even though that makes no mathematical sense at all.
Instead of crypto investing....invest in flash cards

Most of the “Traders” lose their money on the “Exchange!”

9572 2018-04-03 04:24:58 Potentially, ues. The drawback with things like crypto is that there is inherently a risk of it not being accepted as a payment and occasionally being harder to cash out. That and, well, market fluctuations being that it's more intangible than other sources.

9671 2018-04-03 04:11:24 #Bitcoin is trying to make a bullish move. The price on @coinbase is leading the @CoinMarketCap price. It’s usually the other way around and trails the aggregate price. #crypto

9802 2018-04-03 03:54:53  if people don’t get excited and hopeful then they don’t invest but if people do get excited and dump more money in the market the market will react positively to it and increase its value. In order for this to happen you need lots of people with lots of money
9803 2018-04-03 03:54:52 Can we be friends too please?

9805 2018-04-03 03:54:47 Banks making it harder for new money to enter the crypto world, could be partly responsible for the overall dip.

9809 2018-04-03 03:54:30 This is the kinda thing that hurts crypto.
9810 2018-04-03 03:54:29 Yes! Buy!!! No - just kiddin  Sell all your crypto & don‘t buy again until you‘re convinced. Nobody can tell you to buy or sell. Selling & buying depends on which timeframe you’re working on. It depends on what you‘re up to. Trading or Investing. 
Good luck mate!

9815 2018-04-03 03:52:48 Alt coins/tokens are showing early signs of strength in theses "low" times of crypto. Also look at a 1 year chart. Even though it may seem like things can be worse, remember  where we started.

9817 2018-04-03 03:52:20 Cartel can be the reason
9818 2018-04-03 03:52:12 I'd suggest those who are negative have made some bad choices based on others thoughts and opinions which are taken literally. Opinions on TA and price direction is just that, someone's opinion. Its on the onus of those who ultimately make the choice to accept responsibility

9845 2018-04-03 03:48:08 If you’re bullish on crypto whilst the CFTC investigation into one of the biggest exchanges in the world is still ongoing, you must know something we all don’t.
9846 2018-04-03 03:48:02 News that will reach people out of the crypto world too
9847 2018-04-03 03:47:54 For those who’s been in Crypto for a few years, this is normal
9848 2018-04-03 03:47:11 We say “game theory” in #blockchain/#crypto but we mean system incentive design. Could we say that instead? Game theory is the mathematical modeling of competition & conflict b/w decision makers. Blockchain networks instead use strategic incentives to motivate targeted behaviors.

9916 2018-04-03 03:31:19 Did he buy anything in crypto? Or he missed all that run last year from 700 and feeling resentful that his friends are millionaires? Maybe he just enjoying the centralized system. His government or religion will do no wrong. Sometimes, it's cruel to wake people up.
