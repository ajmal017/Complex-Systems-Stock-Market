59 2018-07-05 23:15:22 Right here. I've had police called on me a few times while doing the same thing. Investigating a possible break in, neighbors didn't see me roll up/ don't know about the original call, but they see someone looking into houses with a flashlight.
60 2018-07-05 23:14:31 The biggest complaint about the fees just makes no sense.

Scammy projects being listed will keep happening, hopefully not on good exchanges. It happens with stocks, ETFs, crypto won't be immune.

Centralised exchanges are privately owned, so corruption is a weird concept.

70 2018-07-05 23:03:57 Yeah like I said before.  If I sell my position what am I gonna do? Buy a used Honda Civic?  Not sweating this at all.  The future? Who knows what will happen.  It's the OTC I've seen stocks go from .006 to .80 in 2 weeks.

76 2018-07-05 22:58:23 (1). I’m only watching
(2). Over 95% of huge drops always bounce HARD.
(3). No such thing as “won’t” or “will” in the penny market. No certainty whatsoever, so you saying it won’t bounce shows you have little knowledge about trading penny stocks.

83 2018-07-05 22:51:54 The trend was going downward, to be sure.  Disagree w/lack of DT policies totally.  You can't take credit for current POTUS years.  Stocks soared, DOW up then slowed to desired up & down, but trend up.  Less regs, loosening of tax on businesses, etc...No, don't agree.

125 2018-07-05 22:16:14 Bonds seemingly pricing in #Tariff retaliation fears. Stocks, not so much. One seems wrong. #Payrolls tomorrow may decide. Will rising #WageInflation mark the return of #StockBondCorrelation?
126 2018-07-05 22:15:50 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
127 2018-07-05 22:15:27 Just watched @SteveGrassoCNBC and @karenfinerman debating United Rentals $URI on #CNBC. We own this but have trimmed a lot. The intermediate trend is weak and long-term flattening out. However, may have hit a near-term bottom. #cnbcfastmoney #stocks
128 2018-07-05 22:15:13 Brought to you by Loch Industries..and their puppets!
129 2018-07-05 22:14:54 Definitely a confidence booster knowing I'm looking at the same stocks you are! 
130 2018-07-05 22:14:09 Why? Was the poll even lower? Like 5%? 
131 2018-07-05 22:13:25 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains

134 2018-07-05 22:12:54 What I learnt this week:

2. Partly learnt regex in python.

3. Changing IPs of Ceph cluster on the fly.

4. Using sysinternals.

137 2018-07-05 22:11:09 Maybe you and Brian Williams can get together to create some fake documents and pawn them off to the public as "authentic".
138 2018-07-05 22:10:55 It’s amazing! More money in my pocket. Stocks have skyrocketed. All my friends now employed and making good money. Most importantly we aren’t still attached to the pussy UK!
139 2018-07-05 22:10:17 Join us on @marketcall happening now on @BNNBloomberg. We are talking healthcare stocks (no, that doesn't include cannabis) with Paul MacDonald of Harvest Portfolios Group
140 2018-07-05 22:10:04 I think she should be put in stocks so we can throw straight bananas and other non EU products at her.
141 2018-07-05 22:09:47 Tu estas dentro o aun no?
142 2018-07-05 22:08:35 If they created the product and the niche, why shouldn't they be rich?

144 2018-07-05 22:08:02 Check your 401K.  I'd be surprised if Fox wasn't making money off CoreCivic and GEO stocks, both of which they support through constant advocacy of policies and legislation beneficial to private prisons.
145 2018-07-05 22:07:57  Right......
146 2018-07-05 22:06:51 When will some learn tht the nature of stocks are cyclical and volatile.  It's all about the long term game.
147 2018-07-05 22:06:26 NO shame in their game!
148 2018-07-05 22:06:05 Australian stocks rose on Thursday, with the big banks providing key support as the major miners followed metals prices lower. The S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed 32.1 points, or 0.5%, to 6215.5.
149 2018-07-05 22:05:45 Pero para entrar a partir de  30,90$. No?
150 2018-07-05 22:05:33 Today, it all, our Military is talking about. He was my Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As a disgrace. The economy is desperately needed for our Agriculture!
151 2018-07-05 22:05:25 My God, why did I not buy stocks in aluminum foil about a year before Trump ran for office??  I would be a millionaire by now from all the hats made.
152 2018-07-05 22:05:24 Ah! I think I've found the crux of our disagreement. I believe permabears play on fear more than do boosters of particular stocks; you (unless I've misunderstood) believe opposite.  Not a chasm, as each of us agrees that playing on fear (buy/sell now or you'll regret it!) is bad.
153 2018-07-05 22:05:23 $URI should be on everyone's short list of stocks to SHORT late in a bull market. Its leverage has not declined sufficiently and it craters in EVERY crisis, and of course hurricanes.
154 2018-07-05 22:04:10 Horrible person imo.. rotten tomatoes and into the stocks she should go..
155 2018-07-05 22:03:58 When you see ya Stocks soaring 
156 2018-07-05 22:03:44 Financial tip of the day: If you have a credit card with rewards, instead of spending your rewards points, use that money to buy stocks. #thanksdad
157 2018-07-05 22:03:06 He may be your friend Jeff, but he’s been a TOTAL Trump shill..
158 2018-07-05 22:02:43 $SPY As mentioned before, the last thing I'm waiting for is for stocks to go higher to believe they're likely to do so. Many attractive here
159 2018-07-05 22:02:43 $FRFS not again BB! Quotes provided bt third party! Name & symbol change  MUST starts by FINRA approval until filings showing up on FINRA daily list ...nothing will be changed! That is my opinion!
160 2018-07-05 22:02:12 I'm moving some funds over to @1Brokercom. I already use @1Foxcom, and after backtesting my strategy on conventional stocks, I'm confident I can do okay over there, too. Also love that instant transfer and low withdrawal fee between the two.

165 2018-07-05 21:59:25 Sleepovers used to be an exciting and fun filled experience as a little one. The thought of a Cabinet sleepover over the weekend at Chequers to hammer out Brexit just sounds horrid! I hope Theresa has good stocks of Synders cheese flavour for snacks 
166 2018-07-05 21:57:57 Trump: sticking to tonights #tariffs and willing to go as high as 500 BILLION. No real market reaction yet. Wait for overnights.

169 2018-07-05 21:57:07 I don't do stock analysis. I'm just familiar with $OSTK because its CEO is a serial liar, and because he is engaged in the same fraudulent conduct---maybe worse in some ways---as he has for years. But I don't buy or sell stocks and am indifferent to its price movement.
170 2018-07-05 21:53:52 That's the worry along with more stock and less stocks according to my mum who remembers it well
171 2018-07-05 21:52:49 We really do apologise @alistairmackint if we have misled you though we did say these are available in our @NisaFletton and Nisa Local Thistle Drive stores. Hope you do find somewhere local that stocks them.
172 2018-07-05 21:52:31 Depends on your scope, the market’s scale and property scarcity from a longterm perspective. Yes, $1.2M today is expensive; yet looked at it in 20+ years (inflation corrected) from now it‘s gonna be cheap. Much cheaper than any of today‘s S+P 500 stocks (w/o dividends).
173 2018-07-05 21:52:04 Thanks would love more but  no more grassland to rent. Very worried about the silage stocks and straw prices for my dairy farmers
174 2018-07-05 21:49:51 ONHAND STOCKS, Brand new and 2nd hand. ALL Original.
175 2018-07-05 21:49:50 No. It's over for these laughing stocks. I gave some crap to that progressive Rick Wilson & got attacked by all his leftist defenders. It's so great that Trump has revealed the traitors in the Republican party.
176 2018-07-05 21:49:17 Avec plus de croissance, il y a nécessité d'augmentation du BFR. Le cash disponible et à venir sont les deux priorités des #DAF.

$TGTX CFO Sean Power has sold 47,191 shares of the company, cutting his holding to 438,267 shares, according to regulatory filing on Thursday.

181 2018-07-05 21:46:26 It’s crazy.... growing up I was into stocks (I was a big nerd) and now I want to get into it again and I forgot everything I know  I really want someone to show me how to invest in stocks the right way
182 2018-07-05 21:45:29 Keep the great news and positive updates coming. OTC is dead for the summer. Price will soon reflect This is insanely undervalued. You have product, increasing revenue, and shrinking debt. Most otc stocks don’t.
183 2018-07-05 21:44:51 No need to be a dick.... You just aren't good at evaluating stocks...
184 2018-07-05 21:43:20 Nice stocks.
I mean braces.
185 2018-07-05 21:42:38 We all have the right to bear arms. We don’t want to take that away. However. Automatic weapons and bump stocks need banned. Thanks, basic.

187 2018-07-05 21:41:42 Stocks are doing amazing too. Well at least mine are. Buy on the fear of these trade wars. @potus knows what he is doing, speciallywith China. Chinese are not consumers Americans are and that’s a huge reason China is not going to win this trade war.
188 2018-07-05 21:41:20 The rise in the price of gas for those big dodge and ford trucks is going to be painful for trump supporters, oh well they got their stocks to fall back on. Supporters of trump are going love those tariffs that they are going to pay for. Got something on that in smiling pictures.
189 2018-07-05 21:40:32 I profited from stocks thanks to trump. I was red in Obama 8 years green in trump 2 years  Do you invest or were you just saying that? List some things presidents have changed overnight? Give me 3
190 2018-07-05 21:39:46 Fine. That's your homework. thumbhole stocks....pistol grips. Until I get even a guess, it's because they're scary.
191 2018-07-05 21:39:44 ..good luck with that collection of ne’er do well numptie stocks

195 2018-07-05 21:38:05 Until you can tell me how banning bump stocks will save a life or stop a shooting in a school you should not be telling anyone about common sense.

199 2018-07-05 21:36:31 Isn’t GM stocks down or something? You think it has to do with the tariffs?
200 2018-07-05 21:36:25 This isn’t punishment. He already got his reward. In a just world, he’d be in stocks & pelted with produce.

And while we sing “ding dong the witch is dead”, his replacement is doing the same damage only without the distracting sheen.

210 2018-07-05 21:32:04 Could you translate this for us newbs please?
211 2018-07-05 21:28:10 Very true. Profit % s are high in options as compared to the normal stocks. But we need to be in right direction, that can happen only if we have a good mentor like @ProfitMachine who can help us to go in right direction.
212 2018-07-05 21:27:46 Don’t forget stocks cost just as much as these Jordans just remember that next time you think bout grabbing some

214 2018-07-05 21:26:49 Then why do you think thumbhole stocks and pistol grips are part of what gets it labeled am assault rifle? And why more lethal rifles without said features (and with stuff like wood stocks) are never mentioned in such conversations?

230 2018-07-05 21:13:56 Here's where I disagree Peter. Valuations are unprecedented for R2K, Sentiment towards stocks are higher, whilst we are at lower levels than Jan (ex NDX and R2K) and one time effects (tax/repat/debt driven buy backs) become headwinds in H2 & 2019. I respectfully sit this 1 out.
231 2018-07-05 21:13:28 Because stocks fluctuate kinda randomly over the short term? 
232 2018-07-05 21:13:06 @SOULLOR I'm sure. I've not had the time to read post but seen too many terrible stories (hyped) when stocks get to this degree. Tough road.
233 2018-07-05 21:12:53 @realDonaldTrump Donald, you accept money from the NRA, you said you would ban bump stocks, unfortunately you lied. I will NEVER vote for you again. You are an "American Politician Bought And Sold By The NRA". I like you, but I cannot vote for you!

234 2018-07-05 21:12:17  Mannnn tell y’all boyfriends, cousins, & Daddies; if they can play the bookie they can invest in the stock market. Same research they do for their picks can be done for their stocks. Basically the same shit statistics & predictions.. still a gamble  just less risk IMO

237 2018-07-05 21:10:03 When defensive stocks rise, that's the end of the bull market. But it has to be over a year or two. Maybe even three or more. I don't know.

263 2018-07-05 21:00:47 I'm looking to cut some positions to add more stocks to diversify my portfolio.

This is my current watchlist:

$GOOS
$TWTR
$ETSY
$EBAY
$AAPL
$MSFT
$CP

I'm a sucker for growth stocks. Innovation can disrupt the market and reap massive gains!
264 2018-07-05 21:00:44 Facebook Inc (FB) price at close, 2018-07-05, is 197.7476.
265 2018-07-05 21:00:23 Psei range bound at 6900 - 7200.

If trade war escalates for the worst then 6900 is breached.

If trade-war ends positive then 8000 is next. Easy 10%+ gain

Big cap stocks gets the first overseas pick : AC, ALI,BDO,BPI TEL/GLO, SM/SMPH.

269 2018-07-05 20:59:24 Oh please.  Stocks had the largest most sustained growth under Obama that Trump has taken credit for since stealing the election.  Now that it's tanking, Trump just sucks his thumb.
270 2018-07-05 20:58:10 In majority of stocks i hope.
271 2018-07-05 20:57:48 Bought some $AMZN, $HD, $WEX, and $TJX today. First three were covered before the holiday. Will post $TJX chart later. Has a high pole, but I like the low volatility, high growth opportunities, raising earning forecasts. #stocks #stockstowatch
272 2018-07-05 20:57:00 China's stocks two year low.  US stocks slightly off of all time highs.  So how goes that trade war China?

274 2018-07-05 20:55:45 The stock market is up today in the USA, with a jump in auto stocks. 

China appealed to Europe to join with them in opposing the US trade balancing moves. 
  
And France was upset with the US about Trump's efforts. Instead, Germany today indicated it will work with the US.
275 2018-07-05 20:55:37 Don't think we'd get much for them, might make more if put them in stocks and sold rotten veg to the citizens
276 2018-07-05 20:54:40 Completely agree, but there is a fundamental difference between trading growth and value stocks, with growth, bad trade is a bad trade but for a value company with great fundamentals, a bad trade is an investment.

279 2018-07-05 20:51:44 I own plenty of stocks. No shorts (ok one leap put). I just think we have been in the aberration not the norm.
280 2018-07-05 20:50:49 I want the stocks for days, on the National Mall, and every member of the public allowed to throw and scream whatever they want. I'd take Niecelet to witness history, throw rotten produce, and then go visit the pandas.
281 2018-07-05 20:50:34 And his stocks are black too
282 2018-07-05 20:50:20 Oooff it's such a hard choice! Cause Boston said he'll let me use his stocks until I get wheels, so it'll help me save up for a lil but damn I need more loud haha
283 2018-07-05 20:49:20 Yea, DeVos is a good pick.  I would say, maybe, let's put a target on Ross next.  His shorting of stocks and connection to corruption in Cyprus should be enough.
284 2018-07-05 20:49:08 Well to be fair, stocks HAVE been going up...

But with THAT being said, I do think you have a point. Stocks like Tesla have sexy stories, and storytellers use those to draw in audiences, pumping relevant stocks in so doing. When story doesn't pan out it's on to the next.
285 2018-07-05 20:48:32 For the record,nitrates directive,lobbying on milk and grain price prudent management of smp stocks and low cost finance are examples of recent delivery of lobbying on farmers behalf of farmers.
286 2018-07-05 20:46:28 Here is another one..."false markets." Stock market. People buying stocks. No work is had, no human energy, and just people making profits off of stocks, and I am talking big profits or small ones.....If you do all this just so you can retire early, or you can make big profits:..
287 2018-07-05 20:44:59 ya can only hope.

290 2018-07-05 20:43:28 If you trade in good stocks, a bad trade is an investment.
291 2018-07-05 20:42:50 Like, being permabearish on TSLA is probably more responsible that being permabullish on Tesla. But Faber, Fleck et al not talking about single stocks.
292 2018-07-05 20:42:43 She is pretty swampy with her loan collection and private education grift, but is she Wilbur Ross short selling stocks five times as Secretary of Commerce swampy? It's gonna be a tough call which of those two is worse.
293 2018-07-05 20:41:21 Def think people should favor index funds over story stocks. And anyone suggesting skipping index funds in favor of hot tech stocks is dangerous. But I see Cramers of world as recommending bets for <5% of portfolio, and permabears as suggesting radical (and bad) asset allocations
294 2018-07-05 20:40:49 Creo que a las sombras paralelas podrías probar a aumentarles la distancia y tamaño, el tema de las redes creo que te quedó un poco pequeño. Los stocks que has puesto por ahí detrás no me convencen. ¡Suerte!

301 2018-07-05 20:38:07 So with Scott Pruitt gone, are we allowed to start focusing on Wilbur Ross brazenly shorting stocks as commerce secretary?
302 2018-07-05 20:37:44 for the record, I'm still in.  average at around .10
303 2018-07-05 20:36:53 Ya, high risk, high reward. Thats what we r here for.

314 2018-07-05 20:31:23 When I started to rotate my portfolio and the end of April from many USA companies to Chinese stocks I was greatly rewarded I had 73% YTD 3 week ago , now 22%YTD because of the trade wars . There are always risks . I will wait a little bit more until everything clarifies.
315 2018-07-05 20:31:18 I got stuck in $PGPM last year,
It sucks.  I think $CYPE is done.  The SEC suspended three stocks today and they were all tied to the same group.  Hope I am wrong for those holding.

324 2018-07-05 20:28:36 Have they checked Porton Down?  I'm sure they have stocks of Novichok.
325 2018-07-05 20:28:08 Well for now its a loss until they start trading. I cant sell so that money is froze, if i cant use it I consider it a loss.
326 2018-07-05 20:25:57 From a retailer viewpoint, 'out of stocks' are very bad. People go to another store, They nearly killed Sainsbury a while back.

I ask again. What is the exact problem you foresee?
327 2018-07-05 20:25:24 Buy penny stocks!

330 2018-07-05 20:24:57 Commander,
I dispatch this as we mass artillery fire on a MAGA rifle company. Apparently they only have AR15s with bump stocks. Since they wasted most of their ammunition making 2A YouTube videos, they can’t mount an effective counterattack on our flank. #secondcivilwarletters
331 2018-07-05 20:24:10 Do you oppose or support bump stocks?
332 2018-07-05 20:23:19 World stocks ex Asia rally: US +.9%; Europe +.4%. Markets believe trade war with Europe less likely but China still likely. With a mercurial President it's anyone's guess. Best strategy is avoid short-term gambles & stick with long-term plan. 2018 still likely up year.
333 2018-07-05 20:22:30 You mean other than he was white, Christian and used bump stocks?
334 2018-07-05 20:22:23 Perfect fit!
335 2018-07-05 20:21:54 How about Wilbur “short stocks” Ross?
336 2018-07-05 20:21:43 Scott Pruitt pulled some old-school scummy ruling-class politician shit.

I think his punishment should likewise be retro: 
Tarred and feathered?
Pilloried or put in stocks? 
Pirate-style tongue removal?
Guillotine may be a bit much (maybe just his hands)?

Vote, like and share!
337 2018-07-05 20:20:54 US stocks are higher even though we are one day away from Washington DC and Beijing slapping tariffs on each other’s imports. Traders are relatively optimistic on stocks as there is a feeling that the Chinese economy will come off worse in the trade spat.

Any other standard of 'proof' is quite impossible to meet,not least given that the Russian Secret Services are responsible.

444 2018-07-05 19:31:28 The entire systems freaking insolvent. The primary banks are swapping trash for gold quarterly,  quantitative easing is for hiding insolvency. Artificially created interest rates cram down so massive. Corp can borrow then purchase stocks ....

537 2018-07-05 18:41:03 SADLY      ALL TRUE.  FOX NEWS YOU AND THE FAKE PRES ARE LAUGHING STOCKS AROUND THE WORLD.  SAD.
538 2018-07-05 18:40:35 Day 1: 'Stocks rising on improvement in trade war fears'. Day 2: 'Stocks falling as trade war threats surge'. Day 3: 'Stocks rising on improement in trade war fear'...Funny thing is, these aren't necessarily trite and surface level assessments. It is that chaotic.
539 2018-07-05 18:39:22 First, wtf is a “cur”? Second, since you love the NRA, do you support banning bump stocks?  Universal background checks? Closing the gun show loophole?  National registries?  If no to any of those, ask yourself how many 16 year olds have been “assaulted” from those decisions.

This is not making America great

542 2018-07-05 18:37:57 People are getting sick of the left griping on everything. Tech stocks are up and up, unemployment is still at the lowest and economy has been all time high. Trump has accomplished beyond any other Presidents but they will never give him credit.

575 2018-07-05 18:24:14 Give them a chance. I totally agree. For example, it is uncertain how resistant UK ash stocks will be to H. fraxineus, but they are proving to be more resistant than their European counterparts. However, there needs to be a massive improvement in biosecurity policy.

604 2018-07-05 18:07:38 True but if Trump keeps up the topsy turvy tariff threats, business will hunker down, ride out the storm and inevitably the economy will slow down in time for the election. Stocks have retreated since he started the trade bellicosity.

710 2018-07-05 16:56:35 correct.  There are different categories of value.  Since the subject was economic wealth, I think market value appropriate.  It is less subjective.  It is what people (the market) are willing to pay for the item or service (the price) - stocks are a good example.

899 2018-07-05 15:17:50 Jumla #2 : Minimum Price to farmers as per Swaminathan Committee: BJP spokesperson speak lies. Rates announced by Modi no where near Deaminathan Report. Even funds allocated for market intervention are inadequate to cover 25% of stocks arriving in markets.
900 2018-07-05 15:17:23 Good. But by the way ICICI Direct writes one of the worst research reports on these stocks and the Graphite Electrode sector.

Follow Macquarie, Jefferies and SKP securities reports. 

Ignore ICICI Direct, Anand Rathi and Emkay reports on the sector, and offcourse Nomura too.. 
901 2018-07-05 15:17:03 Might also mean that. This report is all about clarity. Maybe they write like this so we can't go back and point out when something hasn't been done - no one really knows what it is they're trying to do.

1651 2018-07-05 06:22:27 The idea is to stay invested for very long time with a good portfolio of 15-20 stocks for at least 2 decades. 90% of the stocks may be wiped out from the market during the period. But if 10% of the stocks grows  for 2 decades straight, believe me, you will be rich. Very rich.

1838 2018-07-05 03:05:14 so true, best is to be diligent and learn the fundamentals on choosing one's own stocks, the good stock (lots of free guides today anyway) and discourage people from mutual funds and the like

1845 2018-07-05 02:59:20 I'm liberal & own guns. The complete gun ban claim is an NRA trope. Most people want effective background checks, limits on the size of magazines & bump stocks prohibited.

1963 2018-07-05 01:04:07 You like making military contractors rich, instead, with trillion  $ wars? Making the rich pay more in taxes would help. They're the ones who've benefited most from "trickle down" economics. Corporations just buy back their own stocks or give it to their investors in dividends.

1987 2018-07-05 00:26:58 and that is the objective, get stocks green
1988 2018-07-05 00:24:32 that still says nothing about money???? i explained to you i have to have so many hours to keep my full benefits. nothing to do with my money once again!!! honestly you need to mind your own business you’re always out here causing drama. it’s annoying, trading stocks isn’t a job
1989 2018-07-05 00:23:07 That's because gamers forget and choose to ignore a lot of things 4 example, Why are ppl freaking out about stocks when we were told about fall line up yesterday?

It's a desperate publicity move becoz of his fear that his company's stocks will possibly fall.

1993 2018-07-05 00:20:48 Totally agreed. Just because a portfolio has 30 random stocks doesn’t mean it’s diversified. Risk-reducing diversification is carefully thought out and includes non-correlated assets in which the investor has a high level of confidence.

1996 2018-07-05 00:18:18 Most financial advisors don’t buy stocks for themselves. Which is why they can’t advise about stocks eh. You can’t lead a man down a road you’ve never walked down. Or else you’re learning together, so where is the value add?
1997 2018-07-05 00:18:16 Have we ever had a Sec of Commerce who sold stocks short while he was in office???
1998 2018-07-05 00:17:54 Trading on your own can be a lonely dark place when you're still learning the process . try and find a trading buddy or 2/3 that trade the same type of stocks and style . 

you can pick each other up when you're down and push each other to the next level . 

all the best
1999 2018-07-05 00:17:47 It's sad, unnecessary, and going to impact the market in ways we didn't think of.  For my son, I have PMs and blockchain stocks.  Still trying to figure out which tech stock will carry the most weight in IOT.  I'm thinking robotics, but then I think defense.
