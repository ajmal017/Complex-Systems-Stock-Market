43 2018-04-25 21:15:45 In the real world we have scarcity of scarce things (there are few gold-like commodities). In the blockchain world we have unlimited abundance of scarce things. Given this, does "Bitcoin = digital gold" still hold?

45 2018-04-25 20:52:36 I suppose it might be because so far many communist states did not end up the sort if egalitarian paradise people dreamed of and were rife with corruption, dictatorships, inequality etc. The other part is pure laziness and not wanting to forego more stuff and luxury commodities.
46 2018-04-25 20:51:35 Point is that QE does not include commodities - yet!
47 2018-04-25 20:41:59 This is a perfect example of what happens when human lives are only counted as monetary commodities. It's all about the cost of a life and preserving the NHS. This is not a child to them, he is a thing. These are subjects of the crown. They belong to the crown no one else.

71 2018-04-25 18:58:12 Hi Mike, unfortunately, key commodities like coffee have risen sharply and we’ve had to make a cost price increase. Retail pricing is at the sole discretion of the retailer.
72 2018-04-25 18:47:11 Cause they aren't strategic. And what happened afterwards was a jobs bloodbath. Mining companies shedding jobs like crazy every quarter. You've got to negotiate during a commodities boom when currency and price is favourable.

82 2018-04-25 17:49:00 The commodity classification is undesirable to me...commodities historically have been manipulated and very defined in quantity.

Although the analogy may be accurate. Cryptos are limited in quantity. 

That said I would bring in the idea of velocity, and transactional usage...
83 2018-04-25 17:48:20 animals are NOT our commodities, so think twice before going to a zoo or a place like SeaWorld
84 2018-04-25 17:46:47 This is a good point. The transatlantic slave trade should be seen as one link in a chain. Before European colonialism, the Ottomans had an extensive slave trading network in Africa. African chiefs sold their people into slavery for commodities. 1/
85 2018-04-25 17:45:57 Based on that assertion, analogy, classification “commodities” ...I kind of chuckle. 

Dismissing future cash flow, I again scratch my head. 

Perhaps there is hybrid of concepts here, I understand crypto currencies demand is a essential however they need to be tied to cash flow

211 2018-04-25 09:44:21 Second of all, Slavery IS a political economic condition. It arose out of taking prisoners of war, a political act. It was based in the Americas primarily on making workers commodities, an economic act, to the extreme of making them property, an economic condition.

231 2018-04-25 07:52:50 E.g. If in Thailand there has been an 18 fold increase in richness and a 8 fold increase in prices of commodities (inflation) then overall richness increase in 18/8 i.e. 2.25 fold. In such a case, people have become 2.25 times richer in the country.
232 2018-04-25 07:47:49 If price of food & essantial commodities drop should be useful for people like us.

238 2018-04-25 07:15:24 Mere say or ambition is not enough Efforts made and facilities provided have to be shown and spelled out to the farmers .MSP for all commodities at all times, power to be supplied atleast during the entire day ,providing cold storages  and preventing labour to migrate to cities?
239 2018-04-25 07:05:30 I agree. this people have invested trucks and tankers hence distribution of the commodities largely done by them
240 2018-04-25 06:55:26 It seems as though children are now commodities owned by the state. It's not right. The parents should have the final say. It makes me sick that doctors try to play God. #GMB #AlfieEvans

244 2018-04-25 06:36:18 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
245 2018-04-25 06:03:46 Scroll down in the article: 

"Reflecting on this experience, Bishop Orellana says, 'Ever since then, they have been faithful tithe payers.' The family received some commodities from the bishops’ storehouse during their financial difficulties."
246 2018-04-25 06:03:10 If there is any, they would have joyfully told you first hand, but asking you to search mean it's not readily available. Is it the dollar? Price of commodities? Salary increment? Health care? Security of lives and properties? Roads? Water?? Employment????????
247 2018-04-25 06:03:05 Buy Gold, Buy Oil, Buy Commodities
248 2018-04-25 05:50:28 I agree with Laredo Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent Gabriel Acosta’s comments the Criminal organizations view these individuals as mere commodities without regard for their safety. The blatant disregard for human life will not be tolerated.

250 2018-04-25 05:27:29 There will always have to be someone on the bottom and someone on the top. It sucks, sometimes it's unfair, sometimes it's earned, but to operate commodities like fast food restaurants, you have to pay people. Conservatives don't even them to be paid $10/hr
251 2018-04-25 05:21:58 @steve_sedgwick @cnbcKaren Goodmornng i think market got a little bit slowed for all those factors that your expert said well ! just it seems bad outlook for techs and better outlook for commodities so far this year!
252 2018-04-25 05:00:02 Commodities: Cotton +1.11%, Canola -0.74%
253 2018-04-25 04:44:23 The anarchy present in the capitalist mode of production leads to its own downfall. The ever present need to increase profit through the production of commodities is a snake that consumes itself.
254 2018-04-25 04:17:56 On the world’s black market, human flesh is one of the top three commodities.
255 2018-04-25 04:16:48 #Asia Mid-Day: While phone & chip-makers face sustained headwinds on dim outlook, the rising commodities & inflation angle factor in, on a tough session for Asia, on US selloff.

256 2018-04-25 03:56:16 Jignesh Shah of FTIL did biggest scam in commodities market (NSEL Scam of 5600 Crores) and siphoned tons of money abroad.
Scam happened at the time of Congress rule in 2013. Since then neither Congress nor BJP have done anything and Jignesh Shah is still a free man.
257 2018-04-25 03:53:30 imagine getting married at 37 much less 17. marriage is a scam to sell jewelry and other commodities. never succumb.
258 2018-04-25 03:35:00 ... Commodities and Related companies... But who knows? I Don't have a Crystal Ball... Do You? 
259 2018-04-25 03:20:53 I wonder how that's listed at the commodities exchange?
260 2018-04-25 03:16:57 Oh c'mon @CNBC! That's so 2017! What are the Growth of Indices YTD? We seem to be in a period of the stock market where there are Higher Expectations, Still Stretched Valuations, Slowing Growth in the horizon and Most Importantly, Higher Costs, on both Commodities and...
261 2018-04-25 03:15:25 BitNautic is a is a decentralized marketplace/platform for goods and commodities, where end-consumers, importers/exporters, and manufacturers/producers of goods can trade their products with more ease using the blockchain technology.#bitnautic
262 2018-04-25 02:54:13 Foco nas commodities. Isso é o que faz a diferença.
263 2018-04-25 02:50:38 Pricing crypto is all speculative. Binance as a company is worth billions but their earnings are not distributed to $BNB holders. So cryptos are commodities valued on supply and demand based upon its utility. Does company and its token have separate billion dolllar valuations?
264 2018-04-25 02:49:50 This is shameful. I just am so sad and am embarrased by this as a human being. These people are psychopaths and the people pushing this cruel narrative of animals are commodities are the same people leading our governments, only psychopaths would allow this.
265 2018-04-25 02:18:31 IMO, big data is a good thing. AI & other prediction techs can’t run w/out it. What we need is 1/ anonymity of data 2/ data value capture by users 3/ dismantling of platform silos - platform as commodities
266 2018-04-25 02:17:27 You’re right, But that was a Confluence of —Still Low Rates. Now, with Rates Approaching 3%, Markets are Normalizing. As  Rates Continue Higher, I Guarantee you—The Dollar & Bond Yields, will Continue Higher, as Bond Prices, Commodities & Eventually Stocks—Decline.
267 2018-04-25 02:00:10 Iono. They all interviewing for other jobs. All hot commodities. But none of that matter if Kerr wanna slide. Bed made for him one day
268 2018-04-25 01:57:32 But commodities are strong still...and currency could just be  reflecting the interest rate differentials.
269 2018-04-25 01:54:25 Sim, esse do cálculo volta ao "pragmático" que releva a corrupção. O que no fundo é um cálculo bem fajuto porque não está calculando as variáveis relevantes (boom de commodities, qualidade da política econômica), mas a figura e a lembrança da figura populista (Lula).
270 2018-04-25 01:48:52 Can we get AnderCUST stock picks?  Or investing advice?  Commodities esp.  @timanderson87
271 2018-04-25 01:47:08 debt is part of DNA now and will be for years to come unfortunately.  Very different demographics to US.  We have commodities (gold) :)
272 2018-04-25 01:45:41 In thinking about it more. Bitcoin's money supply "inflates" over time, at a rate approaching zero. Halving every four years of course. That inflation target could be the standard that nations target. A money has to only be as good as other commodities that might be hoarded.
273 2018-04-25 01:44:12 Entiendo su punto y ej en energéticas x commodities etc. Habrá ganadores, sí. Pero en el agregado de la economía no creo sea suma cero. Después tenés yields break even bonos-usd etc.
274 2018-04-25 01:39:58 Ah yes, 10-year is bursting higher after so much back and forth.

Remember that chaotic deleveraging I mentioned? It seems like we're perilously close.

My view is it's time to be nimble and ready to exit US equity positions in favor of commodities and emerging markets. 
275 2018-04-25 01:37:28 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.

280 2018-04-25 01:08:33 El tema es la inversión que se le retira el incentivo cuando se cobran altos impuestos corporativos, y más en países emergentes como el nuestro. En el tema de commodities sí es necesario una sustitución en el mediano plazo y un fondo de estabilización activo.
281 2018-04-25 01:03:17 So, interest rates rose from 1940s into early 1980s, declined into 2010s. Due to rise into 2030s. Business cycles. #Fedratehikes Funds like commodities if rates and inflation firm. #inflation
282 2018-04-25 01:02:24 Also wish I could buy stock in @realvision. Love it. Was watching Michael Oliver’s recent segment and agree that agri commodities and grains specifically are assets that could have real legs.  What are your thoughts with the backdrop you describe today.  Thanks man.  Great stuff.
283 2018-04-25 01:01:58 This is an epic depiction of women as commodities and men as entitled to use them. Women have no agency or right to decline. Utilities, not people.  It’s enraging.

288 2018-04-25 00:44:09 Porra Brasil, será que você não pode ser menos exportadora de commodities não? N aguento mais essa merda
289 2018-04-25 00:42:09 Expendable? Give me a break. There's more to life. Find your own meaning. Women arent commodities. Groups like MGTOW are toxic hypocrits.
290 2018-04-25 00:40:52 Drugs muddle up your self-understanding, you become a mushroom suckling on capitalist commodities.
291 2018-04-25 00:37:29 Lo de los commodities es indepte. Puede darse una suba de tasas por otro motivo que no sea inflacion por commodities. Sector financierto, totalmente. Me parece hay que tener en cuenta cuan endeudada esta cada sector/economia y cuanta necesidad de deuda futura tiene.
292 2018-04-25 00:32:59 por ahora, tenes todas las empresas de commodities que tienen flujos mas altos con esta suba en los precios de sus productos. Además, todo el sector financiero
293 2018-04-25 00:19:10 You can blame that on philosophy. Pace likes high ceiling athletic projects in the 1st & 2nd rounds. I disagree with that ideology 100%. The talent available normally allows for you to eliminate risk by drafting known commodities. I prefer 2 & 3 year starters like Roquan>Edmunds
294 2018-04-25 00:10:47 The last commodity super cycle started in 1999/2000.  From start to finish they are typically 18 years (going back 100-150 years ).  Therefore, it is possible we are once again at the start of super cycle.  Commodities in general are cheap relative to financial assets. $GLD
295 2018-04-25 00:08:50 Possible new global currency? Replace USD denomination of commodities?
296 2018-04-25 00:08:18 They care so much because they have all their nest inside of equities & commodities but not crypto because they hardly understand that crypto is not just about using it as currency but as the best way to distribute and share information in ways that will out live most of us here.
297 2018-04-25 00:01:51 My .002c . The 9 year old bull market is over . Bull mkts end with euphoria . January probably marked that euphoria .  Commodities, defensive rally at the end of cycle .  $spy $amzn . Doesn’t mean we will crash but the straight up BTD is dead
298 2018-04-25 00:00:24 Yesterday, USD and Rates went up and commodities sold off sans #OIL. Today same thing happened yet only #OIL crashed but other commodities not so much. What a neurotic market.
