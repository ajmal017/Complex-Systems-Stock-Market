Nail Oil will hydrate your nails making them stronger, helping you not brake them. I recommend looking online for good nail oils.

3 2018-11-08 23:59:35 I wish we could get rid of oil completely. it has served its usefulness.

36 2018-11-08 23:57:25 Unreal email from @AJA_Cortes.

“Snake oil” was actually a beneficial substance ruined by American corporate greed.

Who knew?

Another reminder: the internet is free.
37 2018-11-08 23:57:20 That is fair. 
Between 60-70 we can frac so much oil it is mind boggling.  
The middle east fraccing has not even really started yet.  
My bottom range of 30 should probably be 40.
We can convert nat gas into oil for profit on a 15x spread.
38 2018-11-08 23:57:20 Oil money ....
39 2018-11-08 23:57:14 That oil slick...she’s leakin’ fuel bad.
40 2018-11-08 23:57:14 Where exactly?  Let me oil it...  ‍
41 2018-11-08 23:57:12 Used The Ordinary's Rosehip oil on my dad's surgery scar twice a day and it faded surprisingly quickly
42 2018-11-08 23:56:41 "Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities." ~Psalms 141:5 #Jesus #God #Bible
43 2018-11-08 23:56:38 I need a weighted blanket and oil diffuser in my life. I've decided.
44 2018-11-08 23:56:30 Same. The rosemary and olive oil- perfection.
45 2018-11-08 23:56:24 Note that “bread” and other baked goods made from white flour invariably contained lots of sugar, and possibly an oil as well (cottonseed in the US), so I would question the significance of the “wheat” component.

50 2018-11-08 23:55:47 Eh? Your logic doesn't work there, By that logic cars do not need oil because we had oil before cars
51 2018-11-08 23:55:44 pick up some beard oil from the store and see if that helps bro
52 2018-11-08 23:55:43 I gotchu luv, let me go warm up the oil
53 2018-11-08 23:55:36 So I guess I would say that I'm not opposed on a case by case basis, but a lot of it is snake oil. If there is a particular alternative medicine you like and could be backed up with research, sure, but the "field" overall has too much water in its beer.
54 2018-11-08 23:55:29 I love freshly pressed olive oil wow

58 2018-11-08 23:54:45 It involves olive oil, a few too many rubber bands, a bit of imagination, and at least 4 lbs of imitation crab, AT LEAST!
59 2018-11-08 23:54:37 That’s great! Heard @findlaynapier play a set on Saturday night and with @NapierHamish at Boat of Harren. He was fab. Been thinking about cod liver oil and orange juice ever since

61 2018-11-08 23:54:31 Personally I like just a good diet and coconut oil in my hair occasionally at night... decent for scalp/hair health. Id bet my hair prob grows 1/2 - 3/4 in / month
62 2018-11-08 23:54:31 The rise of the far-right (often euphemistically called the alt-right) is being enabled by the most uninformed being taken in by people who they imagine to be credible intellectuals. Genuine experts are being replaced by snake oil salesmen.

63 2018-11-08 23:54:29 so where do i send oil treatments for joochans poor hair
64 2018-11-08 23:54:28 Their skin starts overproducing oil BC they don’t moisturize ...
65 2018-11-08 23:54:27 Thanks for your answer. Your bio indicates you are bullish on oil for 10y. That’s a long time. Is it bc of little to no investment in reserves?
66 2018-11-08 23:54:24 You know how there is a list of things that once you touch you should avoid touching your eyes at all cost, like chillies... well you can add Olbas Oil to that list.

69 2018-11-08 23:54:20 That’s happened to me before, only the house wasn’t vacant  Murphys soap oil does a good job to get rid of them.
70 2018-11-08 23:54:16 My daughter loves broccoli too! She’s also been asking me for salmon oil capsules to chew with her dinner. Don’t ask me how to accomplish this. I have no idea, but I’m not complaining. :)
71 2018-11-08 23:54:03 I don’t care much for that guy. I appreciate that he’s standing up to Trump, but he strikes me as another New York snake oil salesman. Something about him gives me the heebie-jeebies.
72 2018-11-08 23:53:51 เก่งมากๆเลย ดีใจด้วยนะคะ ติ่งจนได้เป็นปลัด ขอยืมไปอวดคนชอบว่าติ่งไร้สาระหน่อย 
73 2018-11-08 23:53:42 They don't want the soil just the oil that's beneath that
74 2018-11-08 23:53:33 moisturizing helps your skin to stop producing oil, since it feels like it has to make up for the lack of moisture
75 2018-11-08 23:53:17 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
76 2018-11-08 23:53:09 How many job applications have you put in? Have you gone to McDonalds, Subway, Walmart, Target, Kroger, etc, and applied for entry level positions? How about going to factories, mines and oil fields? If you haven't, then why not? Too elitist to do a real day's work for once?
77 2018-11-08 23:53:08 Clove or thieves oil usually works on teeth for me.
78 2018-11-08 23:53:00 Honestly depends on the reason why your skin is oil. But You could try it. It’s very hydrating & light.

81 2018-11-08 23:52:49 I love the fresh scent of eucalyptus or tiger balm oil LOL and rose. Lemongrass is really noice too.
82 2018-11-08 23:52:49 Found ONE drop of oil on a door closer spindle when checking. (I have a clipboard so must be official.) Went back and found only a second drop.  Barely any. Still controls the door, so left.  Am I being naive??
83 2018-11-08 23:52:33 i went in for JUST an oil change. left spending $113...AND he had the audacity to ask me if i wanted to get new tires for $450 PLUS get a new sensor for $140...oh you think im RICH rich huh?????? 
84 2018-11-08 23:52:21 This looks like the lobby of a new age spiritual therapist where they rub rose oil on your ankles to open your chakras. It's just missing a bowl full of shiny glass rocks with sticks jammed in it.

87 2018-11-08 23:52:07 Awe, my friend thought the same of her skin but a dermatologist diagnosed rosacea. Oil wash is not for everyone. A pharmacist told me animal fat/oil to heal the skin, mineral based oil to protect. I'm older too so my skin needs more oils than it did ...a long while ago ;)
88 2018-11-08 23:51:43 Remember when everyone was like “coconut oil cures everything, use it to remove makeup and blah blah” and then everyone was like “COCONUT OIL CLOGS PURES. DO NOT USE IT ON YOUR FACE” .....that was a confusing part of my life
89 2018-11-08 23:51:33 Oh Lord I feel for you. Leaving my home is a struggle sometimes. I would try the cbd oil, I'm just not sure if I'll get ripped off ordering online. Hope you feel better soon

95 2018-11-08 23:51:11 Man! I purchased my peanut oil last Sunday! I can't wait! I inject one of my turkeys with a jerk sauce and put a mixture of brown sugar from MP's on as the rub.
96 2018-11-08 23:51:00 Pro tip: when cooking, don't forget about the olive oil you're heating on the stove.
97 2018-11-08 23:50:36 You’re both idiots. Alaska pays every resident a stipend from oil extraction; classic helicopter money social policy. Or communism, as I’m sure you’d call it. Alabama and Mississippi are net takers of federal welfare dollars paid for by residents of ca and ny.
98 2018-11-08 23:50:32 Some random fucking oil derrick
99 2018-11-08 23:50:30 And how much of that is due to massive subsidies of oil industry as well as a lack their accountability for externak costs of pollution, climate change, etc.

107 2018-11-08 23:48:32 Dr. Carolyn Gurgis at Newtown Med Centre is great. Very thorough, and the gap is only $20.

Metro Med Centre will tell you to drink lots of water and rub olive oil on your scalp, how that treats full-on bloody wees UTIs I'll never know. Avoid.
108 2018-11-08 23:48:32 The problem is so urgent...once these homes of these animals gone and animals extinct will be too late. I pray that you really are serious about using sustainable palm oil. We are on this planet for a short time. We cannot take wealth with us....but we leave the damage behind us.
109 2018-11-08 23:47:59 China is using military might to preempt the PH from bidding the exploration & development of the WPS. They want the oil by hook or by crook, & Duterte is falling for it! If he’s smart, suctioning it is best.

112 2018-11-08 23:47:21 Not even remotely close to the same thing. The slightest thing changes oil prices, a regime decision, a weather front, a refinery problem, the periodic surplus report, etc, etc. Nothing compared to market evaluation - c’mon man, be better

129 2018-11-08 23:44:56 Last time I went they tried to get me to upgrade to an oil change that came with an interior cleaning. I was like, nice try, but y'all won't shame me into spending more money

139 2018-11-08 23:44:29 It’s pretty much the Asian version of Jamaican black castor oil...where everyone says it works so everyone uses it but there’s no actual evidence to support the claims other than what people say their experiences were lol Gotta just try & see for yourself
140 2018-11-08 23:44:28 The oil sands will be in great demand over the coming decades. It is the future oil reserves. The surging non-conventional US oil production will be relatively short lived. North Dakota Bakken is proof. Exxon knows this. Alberta will thrive outside of Confederation.

145 2018-11-08 23:43:43 City of Westminster is reporting that oil and gas permit requests for Standley Lake have been withdrawn though report not yet confirmed #copolitics

147 2018-11-08 23:43:32 Still selling the snake oil I see, what a life eh?
148 2018-11-08 23:43:19 A wee mix of different peppercorns, crushed with salt. Toss the chips in that and a bit of oil, bake in oven. Lovely

153 2018-11-08 23:42:59 Oil & gas biz has always brought a lot of out-of-staters to Texas. They tend to be conservative. They’re starting to be replaced by those brought by tech and medical industries, etc. I’m a proud seventh generation Texan progressive, so it’s interesting to see this.
154 2018-11-08 23:42:46 i’ve come across like 5 aquarius females in my life...
& as a scorpio female, i would like to say.. they are my least favorite people.

157 2018-11-08 23:42:14 Even you the greatest economist and financial Genius will not be able to do anything  on Oil Prices and its impact on India and World economic growth. If you have the Genius touch bring down oil prices. India will do well with or w/o you
158 2018-11-08 23:41:42 Hair oil mi fren
159 2018-11-08 23:41:39 It is not only the oil market but our whole economy as well.  We perpetuate a boom/ bust cycle and it leads back to Wall Street/Banks.  When Wall Street focuses on profit at any cost, we get Wells Fargo, AIG and all the others that drive this failed boom/bust economy.
160 2018-11-08 23:41:20 Conversely, consumption of soy oil rose in nearly perfect lock-step with obesity and diabetes. Of the unholy trinity - flour, sugar, seed oil - I've found very few even realize what seed oil is, much less that it's harmful. Informing the public about inflammatory PUFA is vital.

162 2018-11-08 23:41:08 One more sleep till I am at pastabilites shoving my face with oil & bread.
163 2018-11-08 23:40:56 Garlic, olive oil, and gear all sound good...just not the pumpkin part. Lol. I am in Toronto, maybe Caribbean pumpkins taste different?

167 2018-11-08 23:39:53 When oil is going up fast its the fault of the "dirty speculators". When it plunges we  hear crickets.
168 2018-11-08 23:39:42 What a bonus John Howard who send our young women & men to Iraq helping with a murderous action which had no moral basis only a criminal one, that made the area even more divided. Increasing terrorism during ignorant actions saving US Oil and weapon sales enriching billionaires.
169 2018-11-08 23:39:17 CBD Oil is great for a lot of different things
170 2018-11-08 23:39:14 I went out today to my local stop&shop, I'm planning to make my self some hibachi tomorrow night, I live alone :(. I'm planning to use steak, chicken, onions, garlic, baby spinach, rice, shrimp, soy sauce, sesame oil, and some sesame seeds. I'm not going to eat tonight since I'm

174 2018-11-08 23:38:45 First of all they probably found it in one of their customers car, now she gonna have motor oil in her Vag.

180 2018-11-08 23:37:35 I’ve been feeling alright.. lots of fluids, more oil of oregano  and I put some oil in my ears. Just resting
181 2018-11-08 23:37:29 You’d think with the amount of oil field workers in West Texas they’d have better cellphone signal but they don’t it’s nearly impossible to be able to have a decent conversation with Broc or my Dad on the phone 
182 2018-11-08 23:37:23 Noooo. Get some hot Olive Oil and put in your ear and still try to make it out.
183 2018-11-08 23:37:14 Well, no. Ashcroft got to be the *actual* Attorney General. For years. And he got to anoint himself with oil and cover up all the nekkid statutes in the lobby.
184 2018-11-08 23:37:12 @KerastaseUSA Hello Kerastase Team, any recommendations to get a diamond shine and a silky touch for a shampoo and Oil?
Thanks!
185 2018-11-08 23:37:11 I took my lunch to get an oil change for my car but it took me 30 minutes just to get to the place lmao oops
186 2018-11-08 23:37:02 It is also a lucrative place for business: weapon and oil- Does this connect the dots?
187 2018-11-08 23:37:00 So happy to know that CBD oil I got for my friend is working wonders 
188 2018-11-08 23:36:42 It should come with some oil that dissolves it but if not you can use baby oil maybe
You're probably better off with a pro but for at home the only thing I've ever had good experience w are s*lly h*nsen wax strips

193 2018-11-08 23:35:49 'Beefy's'?  Where's Porky's and Ripcurl?  Whale Oil Beef Hooked.  I think he'll have to change his moniker to ProMo.  If he's earning a bit on the side from this - is he declaring it?
194 2018-11-08 23:35:48 If you can, bake or pan fry it with some PAM or some other type of oil that can fit your diet - the browning on the chicken will help a LOT. Also, marinating + browning can really help! I usually used italian dressing...
195 2018-11-08 23:35:38 I even read sometime earlier that Venezuela wanted to supply Crude Oil at very favourable terms to India, if India agrees to pay in cryptocurrency
196 2018-11-08 23:35:26 A pan seared Chilean sea bass with a cumin white wine reduction over a bed of sautéed spinach and white truffle oil. 

The beverage will be a well chilled Berry flavor Kool Aid
197 2018-11-08 23:35:25 Crude oil has dropped nearly $10 a barrel the past two weeks, but gas prices in my area are holding steady, between $2.95 and $2.90 a gallon. Literally highway robbery.
198 2018-11-08 23:35:17 Do you use palm oil? If so, where does it come from?

203 2018-11-08 23:34:12 Champ had a lot of aggression/ptsd issues (he bit my dad 3 times very badly the 1st few months). Over time with meds, CBD oil, exercise and space, he is a completely different dog. Still has some issues with me (coming in when my parents aren’t home). It’s not easy, I send  
204 2018-11-08 23:34:07 Well Carbon is a pollutant and oil and gas companies get to release as much into the atmosphere as they’d like. This would put a price on that pollution, thus making it something they try and figure out how to reduce. There is no painless transition to clean energy.
205 2018-11-08 23:34:03 Y’all say oil or ohl?
206 2018-11-08 23:34:02 The US is also subsidizing cheap oil and gas for the World. The bill is paid by shareholders. Thank you America.
207 2018-11-08 23:33:58 will an oil diffuser help me go to sleep at a reasonable time
208 2018-11-08 23:33:57 Do you use coconut oil on your skin a lot??
209 2018-11-08 23:33:48 Economist, whose visit was funded by big oil, just said, "I would never suggest  cap-and-trade alone." Oregon should consider multiple programs to achieve climate goals. #ORleg #ORpol #CleanEnergyJobs
210 2018-11-08 23:33:32 Honestly, I roast veggies like 3x a week. Potatoes, bell peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, chickpeas, whatever you have/like. I cut it up pretty small and toss it with olive oil and salt and pepper ( maybe garlic and paprika). Roast at 425 for like 20 minutes. Super easy.
211 2018-11-08 23:33:27 I'd do raw organ meats, sauerkraut, cod liver oil and/or  fish roe :) thinking of it as a brain boosting elixir, the eye being part of the brain.
212 2018-11-08 23:32:57 I listened to a Norwegian on Radio Shortbread maybe a couple of years ago.  Taxation, oil fund and the rest discussed.  The biggest point from  interview was the trust in gov that the population had and that should gov make any wrong move then, like Iceland, gov removed.
213 2018-11-08 23:32:38 Is anything actually 2D?

Oil in puddles might provide a clue.

Nothing physical can exist with literally zero thickness, as its atoms have a finite size. The most familiar are monolayers of oil in puddles, which are so thin they split light into its constituent colours.
214 2018-11-08 23:32:36 But he never called for the seriously incompetent Woodhouse's head or Bridges, remember when he said he didn't know about a park being on the oil drilling plan? And where is all this info coming from that Woodhouse has?
215 2018-11-08 23:32:30 Only if I hand FS2. @DIRECTV
216 2018-11-08 23:32:15 Oil up your chainsaw.
217 2018-11-08 23:31:55 CBD oil is the new coconut oil
218 2018-11-08 23:31:46 Snake oil.
219 2018-11-08 23:31:33 This is a problem with subsidizing these crops also. They just keep growing it, even though they can't sell it because of these new tariffs. And if they are the GMO variety, no one but animal ag and soy oil will buy it, as tofu & soy milk people won't take it. SMH
220 2018-11-08 23:31:26 But barely in some oil&methane counties. Garfield County? 46%! Counties that depend on #outdoor recreation voted #Yeson112. Boulder, where climate scientists reside, voted Yes. Nearly 1-million Coloradans voted Yes in response to “It’s a ban!” Despite no commercials. Significant.
221 2018-11-08 23:31:15 Yes. I agree. Christie is as bad or worse than JB Sessions.
I will never forget how he responded when the father of an Epileptic daughter asked you s hash oil would be permitted.
222 2018-11-08 23:31:14 About to make a nice hot cup of tea & slip some oil in it then pass tf out. Goodnight world.
223 2018-11-08 23:30:59 Leaf curl is fungal, and it looks like that on stone fruits. eggs, though?  i’d certainly take off all infested leaves and do the plastic bag in the sun routine, and douse the rest with white oil and detergent.
224 2018-11-08 23:30:29 Don't forget the baby oil!
225 2018-11-08 23:30:28 Pure Shea butter and pure coconut oil. I swear it changed my life and deep condition bi weekly with Shea moistures deep conditioning mask.

233 2018-11-08 23:29:46 It's insane how lucrative the RoI is for token investments in non-fossil fuel resources by oil and gas companies. Somehow manages to totally obfuscate their entire business plan
234 2018-11-08 23:29:45 It’s logical recommendation. Raise sin taxes for tobacco and alcohol to reduce Vice related deaths  and to generate health funds for universal healthcare. Eg philhealth , salaries of oil Luc health workers and building of infrastructures

238 2018-11-08 23:29:09 They take the teeth out of otherwise good regulations by not scaling the fine to the size of the business. So you get fines that kill small businesses for minor things and pitiful wrist slaps for big oil companies doing irreparable damage to the oceans.

245 2018-11-08 23:28:43 I drink my tea with CBD oil. It helps me focus, takes away my back pain, and brings out my imagination. Over all more productive.
246 2018-11-08 23:28:41 It is for occupying Yemen, controlling the strategic waterway and stealing the wealth like: oil, gas, gold, fish .. etc by the US-SAUDI coalition.
247 2018-11-08 23:28:38 You lost me at olive oil and avocado.

251 2018-11-08 23:28:25 In W Columbia/Lexington we had the Kwik Way, they “broasted” the chicken in a huge pressure cooker. It was the best chicken around. They are still open but it’s not quite as good- probably a change in oil.
Back in the day, they probably cooked it in lard!
252 2018-11-08 23:28:18 Big Oil are the good guys? Ha fucking Ha.
253 2018-11-08 23:28:11 Absolutely ! I will, thank you.  Tsunamis and earthquakes killed many people in Japan - and caused one of the 3 worst Nuclear accidents in history. 
Coal and oil kill more people every day than nuclear has in its entire 60 years and that is just in its normal operation.
254 2018-11-08 23:28:06 Sorry to hear that. Hope you all stay strong. Maybe check out Rick Simpson Oil. Will put you all in my prayers.

262 2018-11-08 23:26:42 Anyway I almost choked to death last night. It was a rather close call. My Navy Seal self kicked in though & barely thought to grab some MCT oil & drink some to dislodge the food. Closest I've ever come to dying alone for no reason whatsoever I'll haunt you for eternity.

266 2018-11-08 23:26:16 The price of oil doesn't change, but her main point is still correct
267 2018-11-08 23:26:01 อิเวงงงง
268 2018-11-08 23:26:00 And as long as ppl want this way of life, there is no way one could run industrial civilization without oil. 
Rebellion, as she speaks of, is much needed but that rebellion will be  fought hard by those who don't want to give up this way of life.

275 2018-11-08 23:25:29 Apparently, buying broccoli is cheaper and tastier when you buy it as fresh produce and then roast it in olive oil in the oven. Me? I hate all cooked brassicas. they smell like poop.
276 2018-11-08 23:25:26 อีเลวววว
277 2018-11-08 23:25:25 I've washed my face with coconut oil and used a warm face cloth to rinse it off for five years. I then use the same to moisturizer afterwards. Its super cheap, really great for the skin, and isn't harmful to anything.

289 2018-11-08 23:24:26 Yeah, the oil companies spent more than 30 million to defeat 1631 — brute financial force. But the 1631 campaign united people across Washington and did amazing grassroots organizing. If we keep organizing people power will overcome oil money!

291 2018-11-08 23:24:20 I once poured dish washing soap into pasta cause it had the same colour as oil. Oh wait! Am I in the wrong room? 
292 2018-11-08 23:24:16 CDB oil for the win!
293 2018-11-08 23:24:13 ไม่น่าเลย
294 2018-11-08 23:24:11 Why are there so many different kinds OLIVE OIL?!?!
295 2018-11-08 23:24:09 True, but rail, oil tanker, 18 wheeler failures are ok?  Give me a pipeline with safety valves any day.  Pipes provide the world with less traffic, is more continuous in supply, and generally results in  lower costs.
296 2018-11-08 23:24:05 กูค้างงงง
297 2018-11-08 23:24:01 Other countries will alway want to buy our oil tho

301 2018-11-08 23:23:50 I guess the inquiry will reveal that. It hit an oil tanker in a fjord, which is narrow, so it assumes everyone is doing the right thing. They beached the frigate to stop it sinking, but somehow it rolled over while they were working on it. This will not end well for someone.
302 2018-11-08 23:23:31 i accidentally put my sister's hair oil in my hair thinking it was mine.... going to kms
303 2018-11-08 23:23:18 My friend ..world is moving towrds de-dollarization...Countries no more accpet $ hegemony now. No more do they want to stay part of petrodollar system. Venezuela wil price its Oil in gold, or euro...not dollar.IMF shal not b entrtaind. Steve backs gold backd currency boards
304 2018-11-08 23:23:14 Why did I oil and salt the perogy water.
305 2018-11-08 23:23:12 It's Martian oil! Always has been, always will be!
306 2018-11-08 23:23:12 I'd be happier if we just left the stuff under the sea forever to be honest.
Scotland has an abundance of renewable resources, we're already a world class renewable energy producer, stuff the oil, we're better off without it.
307 2018-11-08 23:23:09 Fine sea salt mixed with some moisturizer and witch hazel is my basic exfoliator. Rinse with warm water. I also just got some every day oil, it’s a cheap version of all the fancy oils
308 2018-11-08 23:23:04 Hair grease, or hair oil it don’t matter my scalp sucks it uppppp 
309 2018-11-08 23:23:01 Everywhere is low on CBD oil. It’s pretty much a national supply problem
310 2018-11-08 23:22:40 Agreed. My son in law uses the oil for his mild PTSD and my daughter swears by it.
311 2018-11-08 23:22:25 You can do it! Add oil!
312 2018-11-08 23:22:12 One reason (main reason) i like having dark hair. Doesn’t show dirt or oil as much and I can dry shampoo it up for DAAYYSS 
313 2018-11-08 23:22:06 "The oil barons bootlickers"
314 2018-11-08 23:22:00 All i needed was some cocunut oil.
315 2018-11-08 23:21:53 I get it CBD oil is the shizz...

But...have you ever considered...

*licks fingers*

KFC oil?
316 2018-11-08 23:21:51 Guys pls i need your help 
I am looking for any young girl who’s done with SHS or university and live at Tema..She must be fluent in english, have a little knowledge about IT and be between the ages of 19 to 26yrs to help me prepare oil rice with pepper,i’m really hungry
317 2018-11-08 23:21:43 Oh my god this is some beautiful oil painting shit going on here, awesome!
318 2018-11-08 23:21:36 Do you know of any Oil company that has not lobbied recently? I'll plan my routes to go past their petrol station. (Although I don't drive often)
319 2018-11-08 23:21:34 I’m so huge that I give myself a couple more weeks and I’m having sex, using primrose oil, foot massages, etc. I’m never getting pregnant again 
320 2018-11-08 23:21:34 @sal_belli kfb
321 2018-11-08 23:21:29 Just ask yourself: How do very progressive measures in FLA (Oil drilling/dog racing ban and Felons voting) measures pass with resounding success and Desantis wins by running a pathetically bad campaign? Sorry if smells like fish...
322 2018-11-08 23:21:24 เอ้า ชนนนนนน!!! 
323 2018-11-08 23:21:21 I got the sugar one with coconut oil and cocoa butter(I think) for $5. I like it
324 2018-11-08 23:21:15 어어엉....어어어어!!!!
325 2018-11-08 23:20:59 THAT COCONUT OIL NASTY... H A!!
326 2018-11-08 23:20:54 Chicken strips cut up in my homemade salad. Organic spring mix with red onions, radishes, cucumbers, grape tomatoes, red & green bell peppers. Misted with my homemade dressing of coconut oil & wine vinager with italian Mrs. Dash. Mmmm!
327 2018-11-08 23:20:54 I guess any fears we had about demand destruction, EV's, high oil prices causing a recession etc. out the window. State can have a very heavy hand in setting prices from HFT to collusion (don't know that much has changed on the supply/demand front).
328 2018-11-08 23:20:18 $AOW is attracting a lot of sub holders of late! Going to be incredibly tight once they have soaked everything up. If the oil price wasn't heading down we would be well over 3c imo. Foothills acquisition will provide a spike when completed imo.
329 2018-11-08 23:20:16 Honestly, so many pro oil and gas people drink as much of the koolaid as anti vaxxers.... #sorrynotsorry #RenewableEnergy #isthefuture
330 2018-11-08 23:20:06 I might be antique ,but don’t need an oil change yet 
331 2018-11-08 23:20:04 아니 누가 있는데!!!
332 2018-11-08 23:20:03 Don’t forget us in the oil and gas/nuclear industries

334 2018-11-08 23:19:52 This is the new climate change normal. This is why you need to support politicians who dont shill for big oil and pretend a politically convenient problem like refugees  is less important than the real problems of climate change
335 2018-11-08 23:19:40 If you need to re-stock your CBD oil, I have several bottles of both the new, cinnamon  and the peppermint flavor both 750 mg, they are the original and has .3% thc.  IM me if interested.

363 2018-11-08 23:16:12 Sudan, a quasi-regional bad actor (mostly Chad, South Sudan), insignificant international terrorism activities, but oil, Chinese influence growing. So whatcha wanna do now?

374 2018-11-08 23:14:40 @CNN Frightening that this THOUSAND OAKS SHOOTER may have had PTSD. Both Obama and TRUMP think NOTHING of DEPLOYING EXCELLENT MENTAL and PHYSICAL SPECIMENS to theaters-of-war ... REPEATEDLY!! TIME BOMBS, perhaps! Sent overseas to DIE/be MAIMED for POPPY-FIELDS & OIL! Bad karma.
375 2018-11-08 23:14:18 We could easily make oil an impossible business. It would devastate the economy and probably kill a hundred million people through famine. But, yes, we could starve to death with all the smugness the moral high ground provides.
376 2018-11-08 23:14:12 Gonna piggyback on my mom's doctor's appointment for Tuesday and ask about birth control or some other hormone therapy to help get my endo under control, and also ask how he feels about using CBD oil for pain and if he can recommend any kind of dosage or anything

399 2018-11-08 23:10:10 I just had the thought that Snake Oil would be a great brand name for something. Beard oil, CBD oil, something like that.

I'm sure it's already trademarked though.

The media freaks out when fuel goes up a few cents, yet when the Government wants to spend billions on the Olympics, hey, that is Ok, of course it costs just a few cents to pump oil out of the ground
410 2018-11-08 23:08:30 Just saw an add in Brussels over two buildings yesterday! Got really annoyed. Somebody should run a campaign against misleading advertising of oil industry!
411 2018-11-08 23:08:29 The media freaks out when fuel goes up a few cents, yet when the Government wants to spend billions on the Olympics, hey, that is Ok, of course it costs just a few cents to pump oil out of the ground

Montreal did that in 1976 and look at what the city looks like today
412 2018-11-08 23:08:23 surprisingly no. When you use matte products your oils try to come out more making excess oil, so when you use moisturizing products your skin just soaks them up and doesn’t produce more oil. If that makes sense lol
413 2018-11-08 23:08:10 no such thing there's just medicine and snake oil
414 2018-11-08 23:08:09 Oil check ya message

418 2018-11-08 23:07:54 Maybe it’s a meta-statement about getting off petrochemical dependencies? “Maybe the world needs an oil change” as a motto. We should be so lucky.

420 2018-11-08 23:07:38 I dunno Cat, looks like there are mites or aphids causing that leaf curl. Dog, if you can spot small bugs, try a low toxicity bug spray. White oil should work
421 2018-11-08 23:07:25 Oil down 9 days in a row. Does that make you more confident in the stock market or less confident?

430 2018-11-08 23:05:27 Have you changed the oil in the minivan yet?
431 2018-11-08 23:05:18 Price is adjusting to Chinese economy slowing down, special wavers given to 6 major Iranian oil buyers to bypass US sanctions, and Saudis jacking production to bring price down to please Trump. Main downside targets are 60, 58.25 and 56.25
432 2018-11-08 23:05:17 Having an Audi is nice and all till you see how much that oil change cost.

435 2018-11-08 23:05:10 In the waiting room getting my oil changed, dude just walked a guy in my mind.
436 2018-11-08 23:05:05 A whole load of stuff tbh. But most frequently I’ll do a deep condition with Shea butter, castor oil, this mango mousse thing I have and apple cider vinegar
437 2018-11-08 23:04:56 Hmmm as for him,

God is good

Leave his matter oil

We get educated to think backwards
438 2018-11-08 23:04:51 So i asked @Headshoulders a while ago (i use their products) if they had any info if their  palm oil trees, are being planted in burned down forrest's, which results in a lot of pollution and global warming. No answer, is that an admission of guilt??

The problem with the age of the internet is there's tons of information both good and bad out there.

Sure, everything you say is available for free somewhere. You're charging to filter that.

447 2018-11-08 23:04:02 Heck yes - @dwidmaier is right, in 12 years, tech alone probably won't solve the problem. We're a real industry though, with real weight behind us. Imagine if we were as aggressive politically on the topic of climate as oil and gas lobbyists are?

456 2018-11-08 23:02:56 The U.S. is the largest producer of oil in the world.  I remember the tree-huggers told us years ago we’d run out of oil in 50 years.  A lot of what was shoved down our throats as kids never came true.

535 2018-11-08 22:51:37 The US can regain moral leadership by electing someone to put an oil company out of business. With enough democratic support (easily generated by hate for oil companies), and enough transparency and deliberation, a president could make business impossible for an oil company.

593 2018-11-08 22:43:48 Yessss sis you gon be peeing oil for days but that’s how it should be
594 2018-11-08 22:43:28 You can introduce us to oil engineering for help and communication to write scientific articles.
595 2018-11-08 22:43:19 Sana oil
596 2018-11-08 22:43:14 Did you know lobbyists funded by the USA influence politics all over the world? They stopped a pipeline in Canada so canDa,can't get their oil to the ocean to sell. Polina espionage if everywhere in all directions.
597 2018-11-08 22:43:05 We really do need to cut their water, lights and oil off for a week or so.
598 2018-11-08 22:43:00 Cabinet approves filling of Padur Strategic Petroleum Reserves at Padur, #Karnataka by overseas National Oil Companies.
599 2018-11-08 22:42:48 I like the idea in concept, but I have the charisma of a oil stain,
600 2018-11-08 22:42:46 I've been dangerously close to flipping my wig this past couple of weeks at work, so I decided to pick up a cheap vape pen and some hemp oil to mellow out my mood.
601 2018-11-08 22:42:45 Oil change and car wash tomorrow gotta get right
602 2018-11-08 22:42:35 US oil boom > oil price slump
603 2018-11-08 22:42:29 Good, go drill for oil in the Fox building.
604 2018-11-08 22:42:26 Start applying red oil
605 2018-11-08 22:42:21 I have dry skin so put oil on my face before foundation & I really love the bare minerals mineral veil powder to set foundation with cos it’s got a dewy finish like it doesn’t set it really flat and caked!
606 2018-11-08 22:42:18 mannn stop playing and get ya oil changed
607 2018-11-08 22:42:06 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.
It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.
608 2018-11-08 22:41:58 Timeless.. u weren't there, the night Jesus found me, u did not feel what I felt when he wrapped his loving arms around me.. u don't know the cost of the oil in my alabaster box! I've always wondered what state @cecewinans was in writing this song! #AlabasterBox
609 2018-11-08 22:41:57 Got a free bottle of oil at work today. Work perks? 
610 2018-11-08 22:41:56 nice beat from $BCEI silly cheap stock

611 2018-11-08 22:41:51 ゆいこんぬ先生ライブがんばってる！！
612 2018-11-08 22:41:43 Expect the news about how much oil there is to change as soon as indyref 2 is announced...
613 2018-11-08 22:41:33 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
614 2018-11-08 22:41:24 10yrs back...No! U.S $ has been fast loosing its reserve status...monetary system appears 2bbin sum kind of reset. Libya tried 2trade oil in euro/gold, perished..Why is venezuela / madura able to resist..something is changing rapidly. i hope u wud sense it now
615 2018-11-08 22:41:23 Our hope is that we will by then be independent and our "friendly" neighbour will not be stealing it by then We may even have an oil fund
616 2018-11-08 22:41:10 rinse several times with cool water & then use an oatmeal + honey face mask!! v gently tone with organic witch hazel (anti-inflammatory) & moisturize with hemp seed or rosehip oil!! then leave your face alone for at least 24 hours. i do this when i get acne/sensitivity flares :’)
617 2018-11-08 22:41:09 Taa! abi you created Oil plan for yourself and it backfired
618 2018-11-08 22:40:57 おはようじゃん！(？)
619 2018-11-08 22:40:53 Already moved past all your brainwashing a long time ago, man. Peddle snake oil somewhere else.
620 2018-11-08 22:40:33 Can you see the similarities between the #KhashoggiMurder and #GunLaws  in America?  The US does not care about #HumanRights-Its not Personal-its business. If #Hitler was alive and had oil or money, the current #AmericanGovernment will find a way to defend him.  Wake up America
621 2018-11-08 22:40:32 Essentially they are all snake oil hucksters.
622 2018-11-08 22:40:24 あの時のBBの言葉はスッゲー嬉しかったなー…
623 2018-11-08 22:40:21 on top of all the stress going on, my car has an oil leak and it’s not looking cheap 
624 2018-11-08 22:40:05 Esan, we are disadvantaged and is pity tht our leaders don't have a back bones they receive Brown Envelopes to just fall for a trap n be manipulated...

628 2018-11-08 22:39:45 ok i’m going to sleep cause i have to be up kinda early for this olive oil tasting thing idk lmao goodnight angels
629 2018-11-08 22:39:40 I only buy olive oil, but I've read that canola is good for higher temperature cooking. What is good now?
630 2018-11-08 22:39:37 Use Jamaican Black Castor oil. They will get super thick
631 2018-11-08 22:39:21 Not even. Although I am contemplating a racy oil painting.
632 2018-11-08 22:39:09 Until you run out of oil. Maybe I am too much of a casual player, but I NEVER run out of it. It's much better than FGO's AP system.
633 2018-11-08 22:39:00 Just as he has appointed opponents of ALL of those agencies to run them!!! He is privatizing Nat'l parks by reducing their size for mining and oil for profit!!! He and the GOP are selling our country for parts. Stupid Trumplicans!
634 2018-11-08 22:38:53 Because Chad is a oil. Stefan is to creep!
635 2018-11-08 22:38:38 If fossil fuels run out What are we going to do 

NO MORE OIL PLAY FOR @SophieASlut 
636 2018-11-08 22:38:35 We are swimming in oil
637 2018-11-08 22:38:32 اكثر شخص كان يطعن في زملائنا بالعمل انت نسيت ولا اذكرك
638 2018-11-08 22:38:30 But mining dictatorship are weak because their product did not valued that much.
Oil dictatorship though is in entirely different level.
639 2018-11-08 22:38:29 Note there is so much more such that if you squeezed it to fit on the map, it would be totally illegible. There is still much more to discover. Only a couple of years ago diamonds were "officially" discovered in Zimbabwe. This year reserves of oil and gas were detected.
640 2018-11-08 22:38:28 Guess what. I still haven't gotten my oil changed.
641 2018-11-08 22:38:12 Bombing towelheads for oil companies? Thank you for making sure Saddam didn't invade the East Coast, that sure was a real concern we had.
642 2018-11-08 22:37:44 Today, it’s partially Mid East countries but also Russia and other big players. But during the US energy crisis in 1980s many oil rich countries in the Middle East benefited greatly from the oil shortage across the world and artificially raised prices by stockpiling oil.
643 2018-11-08 22:37:39 If only Acosta could piss oil, and buy weapons.
644 2018-11-08 22:37:38 Olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic salt (or some spice blend) and roast ‘em!! I like to roast with butternut squash too
645 2018-11-08 22:37:36 Anybody wanna pay me to be in a scientific study on the effectiveness of CBD oil in treating chronic pain pls hit me up because I'm so down lmao
646 2018-11-08 22:37:27 It’s gotta start waaaay before something like this even enters a persons mind. Quit pumping these guys full of drugs that makes them depressed, suicidal, aggressive, angry, etc. CBD oil and medical marijuana along with counseling will help these vets & others instead of pills
647 2018-11-08 22:37:14 I lost my job cuz some kid just wanted to hit the cbd oil...like how do i loose my job cuz of this
648 2018-11-08 22:37:00 That damage is low down, just above the waterline, so what part of a loaded oil tanker would have to be in contact?
649 2018-11-08 22:36:46 Nice dinner for two, Rose petals, candles , hotel with a nice nighttime view of the city, lots of body/massage oil etc...... let me stop  . My man  deserve the best
650 2018-11-08 22:36:43 No I don’t think Bill Nelson is the best Florida can do and nor do I think he is a champion for working class people. But, is he a better choice than Rick “I don’t believe in climate change because my pockets are full with oil money” Scott? Yes, and it’s not even close.
651 2018-11-08 22:36:41 In a Price/earnings world, oil is a mistery.
In an EV/EBITDA world, it still is, but people say "hold my beer".
If you pump central banks balance sheets, you'll hear drunks say "I think I got this"
652 2018-11-08 22:36:25 Seriously if you want to know the reasoning behind the first coup read "why we struck" and "oil, politics and violence. Nigeria's military coup culture" believe me, you will be enlightened.
653 2018-11-08 22:35:46 I’m always nervous when my followers mention baby oil
654 2018-11-08 22:35:30 Good investment.
Allah ya taimaka
655 2018-11-08 22:35:25 #GunControlNow is like asking oil companies that  all cars will be electric overnight. Wish it happens
656 2018-11-08 22:35:22 I bought hemp and coconut oil shampoo today and it was the best desicion ever. My hair is sooooooo soft and shiny
657 2018-11-08 22:35:21 I’m always so proud when I get the oil changed by myself. I’ll walk into the house stretching and yawning like “wow it was a long day. Had to go get my oil changed and stuff.” lmaooo

663 2018-11-08 22:35:06 RT @LivingSafely: #Kraft Italian Dressing this November? Its first three #ingredients are oil, High Fructose Corn Syrup and vinegar.
664 2018-11-08 22:34:46 *correction: built a major oil refinery for the Nazis that was personally approved by Hitler.
665 2018-11-08 22:34:37 I think you're missing the larger issues. The environmental destruction of the oil industry, which is inextricably linked to big ag. The environmental destruction of monocropping. The further destruction caused by monocropping effects on biodiversity.
666 2018-11-08 22:34:25 I’ve already bought olive oil for the hair. I’m guessing that’ll work. I don’t wanna buy no more products 
667 2018-11-08 22:34:18 Big girl stuff dear.. More oil to ur elbow..
668 2018-11-08 22:34:13 Sorry probably not clear.  CBD oil *is* used for treatment refractory childhood epilepsy. No reason I can see to give to a kid who is well. There’s a lot of confusion between CBD oil and Cannabis oil (cannabis oil can be super high THC). I would not recommend THC 4 young folks.
669 2018-11-08 22:34:13 "Red pepper flakes and olive oil on saltines" phew chile hahahahahaha
670 2018-11-08 22:34:12 Say what you will, but cbd oil is the best anti inflammatory out there. The whole plant needs to be researched, I’m curious as to what else it may hold.
671 2018-11-08 22:34:03 Get a hot oil body massage .. it will help
672 2018-11-08 22:33:40 We're headed right back into it you loon! Look at oil prices!
673 2018-11-08 22:33:37 Have you ever had chili oil? A spoon full will certainly wake you up...! Or knock you down.
674 2018-11-08 22:33:33 It’ll stay on the supermarkets shelves.. I make my own biscuits/cakes using Flax meal/ Black Chia/ Coconut flour and Almond meal .. All fresh from the health food store.. Coconut oil or real butter, F/R eggs, baking powder and Celtic salt..
675 2018-11-08 22:33:20 Imagine being w someone that sells oil pens lololollllfucknololololllllimembarrassedlolollll
676 2018-11-08 22:33:12 Replace oil with spx and ndx and that perfectly sums it up.
677 2018-11-08 22:33:08 No be today money don dey miss under Buhari, na so N2.8bn oil money take miss when he was Petroleum Minister in 1978.
678 2018-11-08 22:33:08 30 years old and I have never once put the correct amount of olive oil in a pan
679 2018-11-08 22:32:55 Koch’s have been found to fund racial segregation in schools. Their dad used to sell oil to the Nazis. I wouldn’t say they’re very liberal on social issues.
680 2018-11-08 22:32:53 おつかれさま！
681 2018-11-08 22:32:51 Dont leave anyone behind unless you are in oil and gas. In that case your screwed.

683 2018-11-08 22:32:44 Serious question. Why not legalize cannabis OIL and make it affordable. It alleviates pain without being high as a kite. Any opinions?
684 2018-11-08 22:32:32 Wrong. I'm a free man. I got a wife and zero children, but you get your cut stains they will be beautiful. I can do multiple fortnite dances and I hold the record for most kills in one round on Phantom Forces. So just try becoming my new mom. I dare you.

I know weed does very well Haha but the cbd oil doesn't have thc so your not going to get the high so idk lol

691 2018-11-08 22:31:58 Maybe if big coal had gotten the same treatment as oil (which actually would make a difference) and the cost was offset in say, sales tax reductions like the last proposal, it would be on its way to law.

705 2018-11-08 22:29:58 I'm a nobody but they targeted website, most started when I posted how we have no clue on the cause of global warming with 500 years at best of minor data for a 6 billion year old planet, and that crude oil is a renewable resource. Hacked over 20 times over last 5 years of 8.
706 2018-11-08 22:29:43 I don’t why the electricity bill is so high?
We are we out of coal?
The heating won’t come on, are we out of oil?
707 2018-11-08 22:29:30 In 2018 I had millions at one stage. Had a takeover from oil rich Saudi’s.....just as I left for Celtic. It wasn’t long before FM 19 was due out. I’m sure I put a picture of the take over on Twitter at the time and said if only. Picked up Scott Brown on a free....at 33 yrs old 
708 2018-11-08 22:29:27 How do oil rich nations normally overcome that situation? How does Norway operate its oil? Be honest now HW 
709 2018-11-08 22:29:24 I wanna learn oil painting it seems like so much fun UWU and maybe ill make a youtube channel of me making paintings????
710 2018-11-08 22:29:13 So a working family can earn $12,000 cash back for buying an electric car. What's it cost once you own it? Glad you asked. Our electricity is so cheap, it's like paying less than $1 per gallon. And no oil changes, transmission fixes, exhaust pipes. #ORleg @ForthMobility
711 2018-11-08 22:29:10 Just flour, egg and panko I think. I reckon the chicken will contract so fast in the oil that the breadcrumbs will make a pretty tight barrier straight away.

717 2018-11-08 22:28:38 We hope that you will succeed. If the most refreshing investment is to re-export oil

719 2018-11-08 22:28:17 The outcomes are incomparable.  1631 faced the most well-funded opposition campaign in state history, from out of state oil companies and the Koch brothers, who were scared to death of losing power, money, and control.
720 2018-11-08 22:28:07 Ok I have veg oil! It's a win we are making something I will let you know if it turns out okay!

735 2018-11-08 22:26:09 They say this stuff but won't cancel the oil sands projects. It's still politicking over reality.
736 2018-11-08 22:26:09 Well i just spilled 2 drams of essential oil on myself 
At least it was orange blossom and lemon
737 2018-11-08 22:26:04 Edinburgh councillors @adamrmcvey & @lmacinnessnp are already planning black ops. mission to chop the trees down. Apparently they've agreed to lease the pitches to snake oil fortune tellers in return for a tenner towards the tram. That's £10 per pitch. They're shrewd clowncillors
738 2018-11-08 22:26:02 How do I get the nail ladies to stop putting little baggies filled with oil around my toes after getting a pedicure?
739 2018-11-08 22:25:56 I’m going to try with the thighs. I think frozen garlic butter and a double dipped crust, with a LOT of hot oil, and it might work.
740 2018-11-08 22:25:43 WTI has declined $15 over the last 25 trading sessions. Going back to 1982, this places us in the 3rd percentile of all 25day drawdowns.

So much bearish news, only 1 month after everyone was talking 90-100 oil.  

- very close to end of this wave lower.
741 2018-11-08 22:25:43 I've used so many brands. Dr. Teal works great or the Epson salt brands. I also use peppermint oil....little to relieve major pain
742 2018-11-08 22:25:35 I hope you find opportunity to raise their unchecked deforestation and the burning of Orangutan habitats for Palm Oil plantations. 

NZ must stop importing Palm Kernel feed for cattle and dairy cows .
743 2018-11-08 22:25:34 I don't at the moment. I am working on some new stuff and this gives me a great idea. I'm actually discontinuing the sd oil once this batch is gone.
744 2018-11-08 22:25:32 CBD oil usually has no THC and DEA released restrictions on it. I still wouldn’t recommend for breastfeeding or pregnancy but I would be much less concerned than for MJ or cannabis in general.
745 2018-11-08 22:25:29 Oil changes matter. @ females
746 2018-11-08 22:24:45 ねむい
747 2018-11-08 22:24:41 EU must jump East or West...and the key point is EU is structurally short oil & gas & will refuse to pay the price US needs to cover shale production costs
748 2018-11-08 22:24:37 thank you, gonna head out & buy some perfume/stuff like that-free moisturizer tomorrow or look at how expensive bio oil is
749 2018-11-08 22:24:35 I would imagine no data. CBD oil is very different than cannabis oil, though. CBD oil does have data and is used for refractory childhood epilepsy and is likely neuroprotective. Cannabis oil is high THC and neurodegenerative but helpful for pain...
750 2018-11-08 22:24:26 should we rely on pre-salt oil in Brazil?

757 2018-11-08 22:23:29 Finland's parliament sometimes makes decisions in their soup spoons to stop them hitting oil rigs.
758 2018-11-08 22:23:27 That's exaggeration, one cow as in how? he is been fed one bull size ram ,(80k), 1 bag of rice (18k),  1 gallon of groundnut oil (12k),  the balance is for ingredients.
759 2018-11-08 22:23:13 Bam beauty oil u mean?
760 2018-11-08 22:23:10 You clearly don’t understand about oil revenue. It goes to the companies who own the oilfields. All governments get is the TAX on profits, of which there are limited amounts now. Swinney begged Osborne to slash tax rates on companies, and he did. There is little tax revenue.
761 2018-11-08 22:23:02 I urge all @UKLabour politicians to not send our troops into wars for political or oil based regions. Our gov is supposed to look after our troops, even after leaving the military. It is a choice whether to wear a poppy or not but the number of troops left on the streets is awful

784 2018-11-08 22:21:03 I had the pleasure of a lovely massage here, Tammy was lovely, the warm oil was a lovely touch, as were the robes and fluffy socks. I left feeling so relaxed and slept like a baby. Highly recommend! Can’t wait to go back!
785 2018-11-08 22:21:02 Yeah, I'm using the Neutrogena one you recommended, so far so good. Hard to see if it really works because I live in Florida so in addition to being an oil factory, my face is usually pouring with swear as well

788 2018-11-08 22:20:50 Tea tree oil but i dilute it a bit. I love rose hip oil too though. You can’t go wrong either way :)
789 2018-11-08 22:20:43  mix it with another oil
790 2018-11-08 22:20:33 bio oil is pretty good for it but you could probably use any moisturiser really
791 2018-11-08 22:20:27 On today's Money Talk, the Fed leaves interest rates on hold but stays on course for a December hike. Chinese exports surged in Oct despite the imposition of tariffs. Chinese stocks slump in afternoon trading and US oil enters a bear market.

794 2018-11-08 22:20:02 Why aren't millennials buying oil changes?
795 2018-11-08 22:19:38 I think you're better off with the MCT oil if you can afford it, but I really think a small amount of the right carbs is often useful here e.g. glucose tablets which bypass the liver, or Vitargo. Even 10-15g makes a huge difference. You'll be in ketosis again pdq if you work hard
796 2018-11-08 22:19:38 I use rosehip! Tea tree oil is very strong so best to mix it :)
797 2018-11-08 22:19:35 my hands are stained from oil paints

802 2018-11-08 22:19:19 She don’t know that oil will always change prices that shit can drop a dollar over night
803 2018-11-08 22:19:18 You spent several months researching this show and neglected to do any research on cannabis oil. An opportunity missed. Rip to the 2 ladies featured
804 2018-11-08 22:19:08 Because I’m such a bad cook , I forgot to add eggs then realized I ran out of eggs. So I had to substitute it with vegetable oil, then I over filled the cupcake liner which made it overspill

812 2018-11-08 22:18:31 Normal, sensible, straight-trunked, slow growing Australian blue gums that are centuries old are merely Roman candles shooting jets of flaming oil into the sky.

Californian blue gums that hit the same height in a century, twisting their gnarled selves to the sky just EXPLODE.
813 2018-11-08 22:18:20 The oil in the car you owned 10 years ago of course. 10 years is a long time between oil changes.  You should let the new owner know.
814 2018-11-08 22:18:18 The biggest source of Canada's CO2 emissions is from burning fuel (oil & gas) for electricity and heat (45%). A distant second is transportation (28%).

819 2018-11-08 22:17:55 I brought some Jamaican castor oil back from Jamaica, I’m scared to use it on my beard now because it smell like fish grease.
820 2018-11-08 22:17:38 What essential oil diffusers do you guys have?? Cause I bought one off amazon & it’s wackkkk
821 2018-11-08 22:17:37 And what if we ally with Russia/China and ignore America? Americas interests will be ignored, losing control about the European market, no access for trying to control the middle east oil. Good luck to keep your jobs and your wealth over there on the island.
822 2018-11-08 22:17:30 @PnPCBC Govt. money loaned to Bombardier or any company is a loan like any other repayable loan. Our Govt. no matter which party in office gives money to the oil/gas industry yet no one makes a big deal about it or gets job guaranties.
823 2018-11-08 22:17:09 Oils I’ve used on my hair range from Argan, olive, rosehip, Jamaican castor oil to coconut.. still stubborn

825 2018-11-08 22:16:33 As much as I hate to say it the British army are scum, look at iraq and Syria killing leaders which led to terrorists taking over purely cuz we were greedy for oil. Sorry not having that lad

827 2018-11-08 22:16:11 Are you kidding me? Google how much fracking and pipelines increased under his administration. Google how air, water, soil quality lowered. Google how he lifted oil export ban and opened up size of Virginia to additional drilling in Gulf. He put Monsanto in charge of FDA
828 2018-11-08 22:16:10 Now I gotta wait on this hour long oil change.  I want to go home!
829 2018-11-08 22:16:09 These are valid concerns, expressed by decent, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
830 2018-11-08 22:15:38 Don't forget to always use essential oil before, during, and after sex!
831 2018-11-08 22:15:06 Looks like hempbomb is a brand. Are you referring to their shot? Have you tried straight cbd oil and doing a bigger dose? Next step would be Colorado.
832 2018-11-08 22:15:00 Where there is coal, or oil, or water-power, there a new weapon can be forged against the heart of the Faustian Civilization. The exploited world is beginning to take its revenge on its lords.

849 2018-11-08 22:11:52 I also use Carlson Cod liver oil, but actually liver oil is the cheapest form of Omega-3. If it is not a problem to swallow 3 capsules a day it is probably better to buy fish oil (from salmon) for the same price (0,35 $ per day).

869 2018-11-08 22:09:37 This is a real question: if I’m not sure that cbd oil is helping me with anxiety or migraines would it be stupid to try hemp bombs? Has anyone who reads this tried #HempBombs? @ryatracy you or Courtney? They’re expensive. I need guidance.
870 2018-11-08 22:09:26 No chance you’ll see those articles, their money is pure and clean because it’s not oil money.

881 2018-11-08 22:07:54 So weird seeing pharmacies in VA offering CBD oil lmao
882 2018-11-08 22:07:51 I love that smell I just got tea tree oil for my beard!!
883 2018-11-08 22:07:46 El precio del $WTI hila su noveno descenso consecutivo, o peor racha desde diciembre 2009. De hecho, el crudo estadounidense opera en #bearmarket al ceder 20.6% desde su máximo alcanzado el 3 de octubre de 76.41 dls #TRMX #OOTT #energy #crudeoil #oil
884 2018-11-08 22:07:39 What body spray do you use? Pam Canola Oil? #NonCoolPickupLines
885 2018-11-08 22:07:29 Why not do what that Mother Fucker Khomeini scumbag promised the people back in 1979, in order to grab power:

  To let each village/town/city have their own share of the oil, monthly?
886 2018-11-08 22:07:25 Our pup gets some anxiety 1 drop of lavender oil in my hand (rub hands together ) hold by her noise 3-5 SECONDS... don’t get in eyes will hurt.   Rub on chest and legs just for extra comfort and a big comfy bed. 
BE KIND ALWAYS 
887 2018-11-08 22:07:22 Yup! Like a walking oil slick in the sun. Our Dark Cornish does the same thing, super striking.
888 2018-11-08 22:07:16 今日もバッチリキメて、良い週末を過ごそうじゃないか！やるぜぇ！
889 2018-11-08 22:07:09 I was minding my own gd business checking my oil at the gas station and this man was like “do u need help with that sweetie” and now his firstborn will die.
890 2018-11-08 22:07:02 I think if KSA had started building an enormous sovereign wealth fund decades ago, like Norway, and invested heavily in education, human capital and had an expertly crafted industrial policy, they could hedge their investment in oil. But it's decades too late for that now.
891 2018-11-08 22:06:46 STOP JUST COOK RICE AND WHEN ITS DONE PUT OIL AND SPICES IN A PAN WITH RICE AND SIMMER UNTIL IT BROWNS
892 2018-11-08 22:06:41 you're supposed to do it for a couple hours, but i'm tryna wash my hair tomorrow so i'm tryna figure out how to go to work tomorrow with all this oil in it lol
893 2018-11-08 22:06:40 Omega oil one of the best parts about homecoming tbh.
894 2018-11-08 22:06:27 Carry olive oil and machete keep under your pillow
895 2018-11-08 22:06:23 Got my oil changed ALL BY MYSELF. Watch out world, im doing bigger n better things now
896 2018-11-08 22:06:16 Borage Seed Oil is probably the richest source of Omega 6 gamma linoleic acid (GLA), that most Americans are found to be deficient in
897 2018-11-08 22:06:12 There are plenty of alternatives. Fossil fuel power plants just need to be shut down now. And oil companies have to reconcile with the fact their reserves will one day be worthless. Pension funds are irresponsible for continuing to bear fossil fuel risk.
898 2018-11-08 22:06:02 Much of strategic importance of afg  is post 9/11 geopolitical situation re incircling China and its economic expansions interests in the region. CPEC, oil pipelines etc. The rest is mostly myths. Every area in the region has underground goodies.

900 2018-11-08 22:05:58 lmao pre pooing is treating your hair with oil before shampooing it. iirc it's to provide moisture and protect the hair from the shampoo stripping all the good oil from it
901 2018-11-08 22:05:51 I really want to genetically modify my body so I can give myself sickle cell anemia
902 2018-11-08 22:05:42 @ billy navarre, it does not take 2 hours to do an oil change
903 2018-11-08 22:05:17 Coincidentally we can buy oil from Saudi Arabia. You know the folks the trump crime family/ political syndicate think so highly of.
904 2018-11-08 22:05:15 Have you ever heard of #ankylosingspondylitis ? It’s both an autoimmune and inflammatory disease. It often takes between 8 to 11 years to diagnose! It took doctors over 13 years. Cannabis oil, especially CBD, works amazingly for pain and flare-ups 
905 2018-11-08 22:05:09 Tbh I just threw random shit into the blender and it turned into a beautiful creamy alfredo. It’s steamed cauliflower, canned white beans, olive oil, ac vinegar, garlic, nutritional yeast, salt, & water. I cooked it on medium-low to thicken & then added the veg & noods!

907 2018-11-08 22:05:03 I was using one of the machines  and it had "standard" written on it as a part of a logo and I deadass had to remind myself that I was in a welding shop and not an 1800's oil refinery so the moral of this story folks is the Rockefeller fucking sucked
908 2018-11-08 22:05:01 @wef Could you be any more anti-@elonmusk? This is stupid. Why don't you bother to talk about the harm done by the oil drills?
909 2018-11-08 22:05:01 Oil of oregano, apple cider vinegar, inhale some steam with eucalyptus and/ or peppermint oil, gargle with hot water/salt.
910 2018-11-08 22:04:46 I’m glad I went to pick my car up from getting my oil changed and it was just unlocked lol
911 2018-11-08 22:04:35 I came across Nature’s One Baby’s Only soy formula that is the only soy formula on the market for vegetarians that doesn’t contain corn syrup, palm oil, hexane, etc. On the can you’ll find their Pure Pledge stamp against harmful ingredients found in most formula in stores!
912 2018-11-08 22:04:30 Konki konki konki master.... Mamba.... Oil chafu....
913 2018-11-08 22:04:18 You can cook with it, it cures diaper rash, you can use it as a lip balm, detangler, face wash, carrier oil for essential oil‘s, and so much more!

916 2018-11-08 22:03:30 Ideal date: 

You meet me at mine and bring cat treats 

We indulgence in our chosen social lubricant 

We devour the fare at Grey Gardens

We stroll through the park 

We mosy back to mine 

I pull out the coconut oil

You rub it all over me

We are a now a human slip and slide
917 2018-11-08 22:03:27 I got some Patchouli oil yummmm
918 2018-11-08 22:03:19 Just got my old ranger back after few days. ..New tranny lines,oil change,brakes. ....loved how family friend mechanic surprised me with new wipers. ..noticed on way home 2 days later 
919 2018-11-08 22:03:19 Jamaican Castor Oil
920 2018-11-08 22:02:30 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
921 2018-11-08 22:02:19 Just to have 45 take all of the credit, and rub it in by threatening them if they dare try to earn a dime on the oil that runs the US economy (and no, LTO ain't running the US economy). Typical 45, promise, take, run, leave trail of bankruptcies in his wake, look for new suckers.
922 2018-11-08 22:02:16 Surprisingly nice, that oil 
923 2018-11-08 22:02:16 baby oil and cream to the ready
924 2018-11-08 22:02:08 They’re alright tho, to much oil come leaking off most the time
925 2018-11-08 22:02:07 It's because our KFCs are remarkably worse than yours due to a nationwide switch to soybean oil rather than basic canola. Their basic chicken is incredibly soggy compared to the stuff from two decades ago.
926 2018-11-08 22:01:47 mighty mouse finds out that oil can harry is his brother who was seperated at birth and thats why they have the same voice
927 2018-11-08 22:01:45 So...like every other day
928 2018-11-08 22:01:20 What would be their incentive for doing that? Oil? You think it'd stop there? Everyone wants more after a while, and a country that isn't jealous of its sovereignty is a pushover.

A lot, a whole lot can and will go wrong.
929 2018-11-08 22:00:57 Oil will start dropping but this seems premature, 2-3 years and the game changes forever
930 2018-11-08 22:00:56 i love the smell of tea tree oil so mucho
931 2018-11-08 22:00:49 I'm so sad that I will never have the pleasure due to the truly evil, despicable steps they've taken by using peanut oil. Please can you post pictures so I can hate you more.
932 2018-11-08 22:00:47 Mix 3 cups broccoli with 4 cups crab. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve with a nice chianti.
933 2018-11-08 22:00:46 RT @LivingSafely: #Kraft Italian Dressing this November? Its first three #ingredients are oil, High Fructose Corn Syrup and vinegar.
934 2018-11-08 22:00:43 Kale chips.  Toss in oil, bake til crisp add salt
Spinach and poached eggs (broccoli works too)
Sometimes iron is difficult to absorb.  Check with your gp.  You might need suppliments.
I'm veggie so can't eat red meat, which is the usual way.

936 2018-11-08 22:00:38 I wouldn’t walk across the street to see a game. That Anthony Leblanc is nothing but a snake oil salesmen. He wouldn’t put a figure on anything Rick  asked him. The only thing he said that was clear is that there will be a risk.
937 2018-11-08 22:00:30 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
938 2018-11-08 22:00:26 Just tried CBD oil for the first time. AMA.
939 2018-11-08 22:00:24 November 08, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
940 2018-11-08 22:00:16 The Oil floats on the water so There is negative relationship between oil & water 
941 2018-11-08 22:00:14 Remember when oil went to $29, the /ES sold in sympathy to help cover the losses
in oil
942 2018-11-08 22:00:11 In the space of about a month, oil has gone from riding a rocket toward $100 to slumping into a bear market.

Futures fell 1.6 percent Thursday in New York, extending a decline from its October high to 21 percent.
943 2018-11-08 22:00:11 Coconut oil babe

945 2018-11-08 21:59:57 NON-intoxicating cannabis oil, thank you. 
946 2018-11-08 21:59:49 I love California, my dentist just recommended CBD oil to me to help my wisdom teeth heal
947 2018-11-08 21:59:49 The amalgamation of Nigeria is likened to mixing oil and water. It can't mix let BIAFRA go now...
948 2018-11-08 21:59:47 I can’t justify the cost of synthetic oil. Good oil is fine, #Rotella is a good product!
949 2018-11-08 21:59:41 Today in 2013 @erik_jones in the Wake Up Narcolepsy Toyota won the Lucas Oil 150 @ISMRaceway. @KBMteam #NASCAR
950 2018-11-08 21:59:31 Money is the oil in the capitalist engine....idk why such a basic idea of moving assets from corporate hoarders to consuming spenders is such a divisive idea among voters.
951 2018-11-08 21:59:30 everything powered by gold, silver and oil.
952 2018-11-08 21:59:24 We believe that supporting sustainable growing of oil crops is the responsible way forward. - - Thanks Sandra
953 2018-11-08 21:59:11 This is something we are working to improve on in the future. We do however ensure that for every gram of palm oil derivatives we use, we pay a premium which goes directly to sustainable palm oil growers. ..
954 2018-11-08 21:59:11 二度寝しそうで嫌だね……
955 2018-11-08 21:59:11 I don’t like peanut oil ):
956 2018-11-08 21:58:57 Due to us not using palm oil in its primary form, we are unable to trace where our palm oil derivatives are from and therefore unable to confirm if they are from a sustainable source....
957 2018-11-08 21:58:54 Nice with a lump of French bread to counter the German pumpkin oil.
958 2018-11-08 21:58:50 オハヨー！！！朝！！！くもり！！！
959 2018-11-08 21:58:40 I could do with a bath of bio oil
960 2018-11-08 21:58:39 Very misleading article and has nothing to do with cash flow and profitability at $70 oil. But if you want to believe the shale can’t produce cash flow at $70 go ahead
961 2018-11-08 21:58:30 Hi Maria. We do not use Palm oil as an ingredient in any formulation however we do use ingredients that are derived from palm oil...
962 2018-11-08 21:58:07 @Zinababs interested in the perfume oil
963 2018-11-08 21:57:59 اخذتو رقمي للتواصل وماا تواصلتو معي
964 2018-11-08 21:57:50 I'd oil it.
965 2018-11-08 21:57:47 Hausa fulani mask their laziness with patriotism. Nothing like one Nigeria its Biafra oil and gas that is their target.
966 2018-11-08 21:57:44 Looks great! Love the @Lucas_Oil!
967 2018-11-08 21:57:41 I have the oil and mousse!! It works too
968 2018-11-08 21:57:33 It's just tracking the price of oil. It will continue to go down if oil prices continue to weaken. All oil stocks are down.
969 2018-11-08 21:57:33 Or use Superfood oil under it
970 2018-11-08 21:57:26 The soybean, corn and pork farmers and that's just the beginning. Oh, yeah, and oil hit a six year low today. Are we winning yet?
971 2018-11-08 21:57:07 hydrogen peroxide, blue dawn, listerine and tea trea oil.
972 2018-11-08 21:57:05 Whats a good price for an oil change? cus bitch my car must be a transformer costing 98$ ... im done.
973 2018-11-08 21:56:57 These are all sensible. Overall it’s dependent on oil price though. Emissions can change 30MT+ per year easily on oil price and it’s trending up. Look at the 2006 through 2008 changes.
974 2018-11-08 21:56:51 I have lavander oil on my light bulbs, raditors and bed post so please get rid of these tension headaches
975 2018-11-08 21:56:42 a cup of tea with 50 grams shredded fresh ginger and a bit fresh turmeric, a piece of butter, a little coconut oil and a pinch of salt 
976 2018-11-08 21:56:37 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.

983 2018-11-08 21:55:32 I almost forgot... 

NOT wearing obantee (pant) is that the new trend for slay queens now? 
Cause what I saw in the afternoon, I'm still washing my eyes with olive oil.

I need to unsee what I saw in the afternoon.
984 2018-11-08 21:55:24 セカンド特装版……もうちょっと我慢する、ひぷくん行かないといけないし
985 2018-11-08 21:55:03 Or was it a Russian oil tanker directed by Putin himself?
986 2018-11-08 21:54:56 Following public pressure, an oil and gas company has decided not to drill under Standley Lake

988 2018-11-08 21:54:31 Does anyone make it to the date before the mileage on their oil Chang sticker?
989 2018-11-08 21:54:24 Very similar how climate change was almost never mentioned in the discussions about lifting the US crude oil export ban. Elizabeth Warren was one of the few who even raised the issue in congressional hearings. They mostly talked about gas prices and national security.
990 2018-11-08 21:54:21 Parfait et nous payons le gaz oil polluant n importe quoi
991 2018-11-08 21:54:21 Will be towed to the nearest oil terminal, but seems very lightly damaged !
992 2018-11-08 21:54:21 There is no "free-market". Anyone who points to this as a solution is full of shit. The West is as much "free-market" as China is "Communist". In many ways OPEC continues to save the West from itself. How much US oil has been given away, with little structural return to US?
993 2018-11-08 21:54:19 Midnight Oil
994 2018-11-08 21:54:06 When he’s finished with that My Jeep could use an oil change in Room 130.

999 2018-11-08 21:53:08 I regretfully had to cancel an art book I preordered.  Cuz that money has to go to an oil change tomorrow. 

Plus idk what amazons doing bit it’s been like two weeks since I first preordered and they still hadn’t updated on the order... so idk.

1001 2018-11-08 21:52:52 Trump isn't killing our economy with a thousand cuts, but he is hobbling it with a dozen.  Also the Iran deal backout raised oil prices which made his Russian friends happy, happy, happy.  Gas prices always increase under a republican president.  Always.
1002 2018-11-08 21:52:17 R.I.P. DeepWater Horizon (4.9 million barrels of oil lost)
1003 2018-11-08 21:52:07 @marksandspencer what is your policy on returning beauty items that cause an allergic reaction? Bought Pixi rose oil on 4Nov. Face now inflamed with spots on chin. Appreciate this isn’t your fault but wondered if I could return this?
1004 2018-11-08 21:51:57 I’m here now my check engine light came on they said it was the oil
1005 2018-11-08 21:51:57 Finally about to go get my oil changed
1006 2018-11-08 21:51:36 Blending is key- many CBD oil blends formulated at 10:1 or 20:1 CBD TO THC
1007 2018-11-08 21:51:22 This Arab leaders called "oil barrels", does know nothing but giving bribes, it is their only policy .
while there are  corrupt politicians in the west then every thing will be okay for the murderers

1011 2018-11-08 21:50:25 @MyDorot now that your garlic product contains canola oil, are you using a gmo free product?
1012 2018-11-08 21:50:15 I'm guessing those holding 401K's and Wall Street will donate about .80 cents to Trump in 2020 after this BS!! Long Live Khashoggi ...Your life was worth 13Bucks/Barrel of oil....BEFORE THE MIDTERMS!! @realDonaldTrump @cvpayne
1013 2018-11-08 21:50:09 I LOVE fish but refuse to eat it because of Fukushima & the nonstop Gulf
oil spilling into the ocean. Before these I ate fish at least 3 times a week.
I eat chicken twice a week. Pork once a month.
1014 2018-11-08 21:50:07 oh yes; exercise, reducing caffeine, eating nuts, avocadoes, whole grain. raspberry leaf tea (source of oxytocin). clary sage essential oil (sniff, rub on skin etc)
1015 2018-11-08 21:50:00 first time taking my new car to get an oil change only to find it out it takes full synthetic.......... bitch do i look like i have full synthetic money
1016 2018-11-08 21:49:48 Thanks, Do you have data on how much cumulitive oil had dropped each of those 5 times after the 9 days?
1017 2018-11-08 21:49:46 Pls i need a copy too....tnx
1018 2018-11-08 21:49:24 Amazing bs coming from Ken Starr. No one is fooled. No sentient person could believe that Whitaker is going to set aside his personal views and allow Mueller to continue unhindered. Starr is either extremely naive, or more likely, a snake oil salesman willing to carry Trump’s H2O
1019 2018-11-08 21:49:15 My old boss gave her then 4 year old daughter a tissue enfused with Olbas Oil to use as loo roll when they were out one day.

1022 2018-11-08 21:49:07 oil on canvas: "Figures with the distance from the synapse and with time from the binding of the neurotransmitter" (Another Crap Art TM 2003)
1023 2018-11-08 21:49:05 Hi Bob, any thoughts on oil cycle?
1024 2018-11-08 21:48:48 oil on canvas: "Museum with different voltage sensitivity and different temporal dynamics" (Another Crap Art TM 2012)
1025 2018-11-08 21:48:27 oil on canvas: "Shark with the use of facilitated diffusion and active transport" (Another Crap Art TM 2008)
1026 2018-11-08 21:48:23 There was the one with the fuel made from a crop (vegetable oil?) but I don’t remember them fuelling cars with booze!
1027 2018-11-08 21:48:00 couldn't help myself and took a starter position in $UWTIF today. the 20+% slam in oil just made it too tempting.
1028 2018-11-08 21:47:47 getting popped by oil is probably the worst shit ever while cooking
1029 2018-11-08 21:47:41 You will be voted out, we need someone who is for Alberta oil, your social license experiment was a complete failure in helping the oil industry, you are out of touch
1030 2018-11-08 21:47:25 Wrong type of oil, worthless, nobody would buy it. Blah, blah, blah. Usual scare stories.
1031 2018-11-08 21:47:20 The UK doesn’t have Oil, Scotland on the other hand does, where it’s economic value is syphoned off to England & a pittance is sent back to Scotland while England exclaims it pays economically in support for Scotland. Funny that eh!! 
1032 2018-11-08 21:47:19 They don’t know ‘bout that blessing oil! #Covered
1033 2018-11-08 21:47:18 Just realized I’m 1,000 over on my oil change nbd
1034 2018-11-08 21:47:12 well first of all its oil king...
1035 2018-11-08 21:46:59 Oil provides so much more than fuel, that's pretty much a by product of production.
It frustrates the hell out of me that we have very little polymer manufacturing here because.....oh that's right Westminster.
1036 2018-11-08 21:46:58 @jiffylube and while the other 3 guys were waiting around no one thought to clean the windshield or windows, they possibly put the wrong oil in(charged for conventional but swears it was synthetic, they corrected the billing at least to charge me more)
1037 2018-11-08 21:46:57 So an elderly friend posts on Fb that she has pneumonia and someone leaves the comment "oregano oil". That's the whole comment. Some people urgently need training in how to condole (and, apparently, in whether they're doctors).
1038 2018-11-08 21:46:45 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
1039 2018-11-08 21:46:25 Olbas oil on your shirt/PJs and Lemsips for the throat, plus balsam tissues. Feel better x
1040 2018-11-08 21:46:23 I just paid $40 today to get my oil changed and got to enjoy free snacks and beverages while it was changed. I AM NOT COMPLAINING
1041 2018-11-08 21:46:18 The year is 2027. Unemployable millennials huddled together inject sriracha cut with chilli oil just to keep warm
1042 2018-11-08 21:46:17 Hilary,  

Did you use (olive) (oil)? Just curiocity! 
Why did you use it? 

Hilary I am freezing here. It is too cold.
1043 2018-11-08 21:46:14 I worked on an oil refinery and part of its products were termed white oil which went into all sorts of items.  I think the swinging sixties saw it off the gents grooming list.  Think Brute did the same for Old Spice  
1044 2018-11-08 21:46:11 Not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing but oil has gone from $70/bbl to $60/bbl in the wink of an eye. #oilandgas
1045 2018-11-08 21:46:01 Spice up your sex life with an essential oil!
1046 2018-11-08 21:45:34 Bearded men of the TL, please recommend a good beard oil
1047 2018-11-08 21:45:34 Why is this even a thing?!? Hurt’s Donuts told me the same thing about their donuts, which they advertise as gluten free-ish, saying the heat of the oil kills any gluten. 
1048 2018-11-08 21:45:33 Most are/were running full capacity to snag high prices but will not sustain pace with an $80Barrel agenda. Also fracking is quite in debt. Current contracts continue to dip and its BK for some. With the Oil industry not having any true crisis yet a lot can happen at once.
1049 2018-11-08 21:45:22 I be fucking over my car  I was suppose to get this oil change along time ago

1051 2018-11-08 21:45:17 13m-share sponsor block of $AR - strange time to sell with oil in bear market today
1052 2018-11-08 21:45:15 @jiffylube your business @ 2311 Orleans in Baltimore needs some training. Out of oil, 5 guys, my car only, over an hour, lost socket in engine compartment, forgot to button up splash shield, drove my ladder and rack into their garage door.
1053 2018-11-08 21:45:14 My husband left town without his stash of Kiehl's products (!!) so guess who's going to bathe in Midnight Recovery Oil and Line-Reducing Concentrate for the next 3 days... 
1054 2018-11-08 21:45:10 now let's compare this to oil, or maybe diamonds?
1055 2018-11-08 21:45:06 Give yourself a cleansing with sage or palo santo. Also a bath with some drops of Florida water if you don’t have that then just add epson salt, lavender oil & some rose pedals or chamomile flowers.you can also do the same with a shower by using a lavender or chamomile soap.
1056 2018-11-08 21:44:53 I got the more expensive oil that last 6000 miles instead of 3000
1057 2018-11-08 21:44:48 yo fuck the gas and oil companies
1058 2018-11-08 21:44:40 I agree Charles! it's like trying to divine why a BUSINESSMAN like Trump would reduce regs on the Oil/Gas industries to assist these industries to CREATE JOBS....Then TANKS OIL and thereby Jeopardizing the VERY SAME JOBS??? I guess once in the WH they all become VOTE WHORES!
1059 2018-11-08 21:44:35 Gats ask RandR how much dem go sell Baobab Oil for me if I bring my bottle. Can even dash/pay them in more bottles.
1060 2018-11-08 21:44:32 Im just saying melting pointof marble is 850°c and a crude oil fire is aroung 250°c now maybe theres someother oil that burns higher but for some reason that just stuck out to me
1061 2018-11-08 21:44:32 @TomPerez if you let that snake oil salesmen Sanders run as a Dem I'll never vote D again and I'll register independent
He's NOT a Dem.
We need young blood in our party, not an old, racist, misogonistic hack.
1062 2018-11-08 21:44:30 China may be only one buying, but suddenly we have Saudi studying disbanding OPEC?  If one is going to sell oil in multiple currencies, one no longer needs a cartel to maximize profits; one can switch among currencies as needed...
1063 2018-11-08 21:44:09 Of course, you could look at it this way. For much of 2017 India - a predominantly cash economy - ran on between 4 and 9 lac crores less cash than might have been the case. That's like running a motor without oil. Now in 2018 it is 2 lac crores less than 'expected'
1064 2018-11-08 21:44:07 i accidentally rubbed some peppermint oil in my eye , that shit burnt soooo bad
1065 2018-11-08 21:44:06 Haha, ethics and the Trump White House go together like oil and water or like poles of magnets...
1066 2018-11-08 21:44:04 The oil price turns on/off the US junk bond financing
1067 2018-11-08 21:44:04 Shame on you, Addison. Get a time machine, learn how to be a snake oil salesman, and get yourself elected.
1068 2018-11-08 21:44:00 Tea tree can be super irritating to the skin without a carrier oil. Rose hip can be applied directly without one though. Check out a brand called R Devine skincare if you’re looking for something new that’s essential oil based. Small batch from an incredible woman out of Canada.
1069 2018-11-08 21:43:57 That would never do - we must be able to feel very self righteous and superior - perhaps if the old soldiers could anoint our feet in oil we could bung them an extra few quid-anyway, they are lucky we allowed them to put their life on the line for us 
1070 2018-11-08 21:43:45 Qatar struck it rich w/gas deposits+now no 1 is poor living in slums.
Why can't other oil rich countries treat their ppl this way,granted it wont be 2extent as qatar bc..small population..but they can better citizens lives instead of hiding their slums from world like..umm..ksa
1071 2018-11-08 21:43:18 There's lots of money to be made in say destroying a large part of Iraq’s infrastructure then taking their oil revenue and paying US corporations to rebuild the country you bombed.

Winners:
Defence Contractors
Arms Manufacturers
Oil Companies

Losers:
U.S. taxpayers
Iraqi people
1072 2018-11-08 21:43:15 Are these oil wars really worth someone being so traumatized and committing these acts?
1073 2018-11-08 21:43:11 Oil supply to india
1074 2018-11-08 21:42:54 Kudos to Lee Johnson @MazdaUSA at Kirland, WA! Consistently great experience during oil changes for 4+ years now. zoom zoom!
1075 2018-11-08 21:42:52 $55 just to get my oil changed
1076 2018-11-08 21:42:45 Weed, BO, and Patchouli Oil.
1077 2018-11-08 21:42:43 No.Why was Germany not allowed to a military? The problem for the broke British Empire, was that Germany industry was out producing the BE, because they had adoptied the American model of developing land mass areas instead of just coasts, where RN ruled. Oil key to future warfare
1078 2018-11-08 21:42:42 Is this where I get naked, rub myself in oil and scream about the Snyder Cut?
1079 2018-11-08 21:42:40 Its only Africans who buy anointing oil for protection from a pastor who has 6 bodyguards. 
1080 2018-11-08 21:42:31 This oil my dermatologist gave me for my scalp is A1
1081 2018-11-08 21:42:20 How can you possibly fuck up an oil change lol.
1082 2018-11-08 21:42:00 #TBT to the first-generation 1973 Honda Civic. DId you know due to it's fuel efficiency and affordable pricing the Honda Civic became an instant hit during the oil crisis? We think the classic pop-out windows may have had something to do with it's instant popularity too!
1083 2018-11-08 21:41:56 What do you use to get your skin slick like that? That’s not plain baby oil. 
1084 2018-11-08 21:41:53 First of all, don’t put coconut oil in anything 
1085 2018-11-08 21:41:50 CBD oil works on dogs as well. Great stuff
1086 2018-11-08 21:41:42 Yes corn tortilla rolled with a hot dog in it sliced through the middle with cheese and fried in oil then dipped into some mustard  mom called it a Mexican crispy corn dog.
1087 2018-11-08 21:41:36 Keep pumping oil and detach from foreign oil completely.Go USA!!! Military brat- 10 4
1088 2018-11-08 21:41:34 #FRR. He is so sexy. It's affecting my trading. It's pointing up!
1089 2018-11-08 21:41:14 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
1090 2018-11-08 21:41:14 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1091 2018-11-08 21:41:13 
1092 2018-11-08 21:41:13 Just haggled Goodyear down from $90 to $30 for an oil change... I’m pretty sure I leveled up my Disgruntled White Dad skill by like 10 lol

1094 2018-11-08 21:40:49 I know a few ladies who will help apply the baby oil lol.
1095 2018-11-08 21:40:48 Skincare question! Ladies do you guys prefer using tea tree oil or rose hip? Or both
1096 2018-11-08 21:40:45 A5: I use coconut oil instead of butter in many dishes, and we have fresh veggies and dip instead of rolls to cut back on carbs. #FestiveFlavors
1097 2018-11-08 21:40:45 the neti pot seems to help me. also the peppermint essential oil, but i know its hard to tolerate the smell
1098 2018-11-08 21:40:35 A5 using apple sauce in my cakes instead of oil! #FestiveFlavors
1099 2018-11-08 21:40:30 First time: Shame on me....Second time: Shame on you....Third time: Really?? The odds are slim (Olive Oil) *SN* Stop being the stupid person in ALL your encounters/conversations... #BLESSED
1100 2018-11-08 21:40:29 I use the Argan Oil nair.. it works fine for me!
1101 2018-11-08 21:40:28 Also add Banks/CC companies that will lose rev from gas charges that move to home charging....#tsla is impacting multiple industries and rev streams beyond oil.  All those that stand to lose are in the bear camp....

1106 2018-11-08 21:40:02 Wow I'm sueing BP, I can't believe they let another oil spill happen
1107 2018-11-08 21:39:59 Trump is very worried as he OWES so much $ to Russian oil obliarchs
1108 2018-11-08 21:39:59 Cannabis oil stops them x
1109 2018-11-08 21:39:53 Cause yah boy can’t control crude oil lol
1110 2018-11-08 21:39:52 Walk into any barber shop, sit in any chair but the first one. Ask for a fade on the sides, but don't touch the top. Get you some pink oil moisturizer cream, get about a dime size, work that between your hands then run it through your hair.
1111 2018-11-08 21:39:51 A5  SUB applesauce instead of oil #FestiveFlavors
1112 2018-11-08 21:39:39 Q5  Add applesauce instead of veggie oil to cakes  #FestiveFlavors
1113 2018-11-08 21:39:38 Guy at the oil change place. “You’re due for an engine flush and fluid change for an extra 209.99” me: “Sorry payday is already gone and can’t afford that at the moment” him “girl I completely understand this bill bullshit is ridiculous” 
1114 2018-11-08 21:39:34 How about the "wizard" who has an entire village thinking he's somebody besides a snake oil salesman. Making pie crust promises, never kept, and constantly lying to everyone?
1115 2018-11-08 21:39:16 Golly. Tannic, leathery, foxy Chardonnay with layers of concentrated mustard oil.
1116 2018-11-08 21:39:12 Palm oil alone is responsible for 4% of world wide deforestation
1117 2018-11-08 21:38:57 How will pipelines help us refine oil on site? It’s only logical that to be self sufficient we extract and refine in the same place. No shipping of raw, unusable materials. Safer, more economical, creates jobs. Literally everyone wins.
1118 2018-11-08 21:38:47 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts olive oil with 1 part grapefruit juice and 1 part almond butter. Add paprika and agave to taste.

1121 2018-11-08 21:38:34 Since I had cancer back in 2012, I’ve tried several brands of CBD oil and discovered that yours is the best for me. I’ve been a loyal customer for years. Thanks @charlottesweb
1122 2018-11-08 21:38:27 Preach Kaya! For all veterans in the thread - we offer 40% off our CBD oil with military ID.

1132 2018-11-08 21:36:32 Interesting that the 2020 WTI price same as Dec 2018. Outer year oil prices barely moved - this year fallen - speculators? Not fundamentals?
1133 2018-11-08 21:36:28 Maybe the oil definitely not no dry ass eye drops 
1134 2018-11-08 21:36:22 I added extra garlic oil and chilli oil too as I hate myself.

1145 2018-11-08 21:35:02 i’m fed up. my skin can not keep up and it’s already sensitive af. i literally get splashed with brake fluid, ac fluid , power steering, oil all sorts of shit. on top of the trash ass air in there
1146 2018-11-08 21:35:01 I believe the disabling of the FDA by Reagan/Bush allowed big pharma to sell snake oil again.
1147 2018-11-08 21:34:56 at the car shop with $107 on my debit card & the lady says my oil change is $132. But then she realized she made a mistake, I only owe $98 and my card doesn’t get declined. It’s the little things :’)
1148 2018-11-08 21:34:44 And how did that work out?
I’ll tell you, a disaster. It is estimated up to 60,000 jobs were effected by the drop in oil price, the oil companies got a tax break and then also drove the supply chain prices down. Many people suffered, yet the oil companies coined it in 
1149 2018-11-08 21:34:43 Gotta go get an oil change and grab dinner but when I get home I’m filming a video.... wonder who I’ll piss off today?
1150 2018-11-08 21:34:40 Congratulations to her; I hope she can make a difference. But, it’s a FOOL who thinks they can ‘love America ‘ by loving Trump - incompatible. Love America-Love GOP...yes! Trump is no friend of anyone’s. He’s a greasy, snake oil salesman.
1151 2018-11-08 21:34:35 omg I'm so glad they moved away from you! I'm gonna start seducing these dogs with treats + melatonin + magnesium + CBD oil in hopes they chill the fuck out.

1155 2018-11-08 21:33:56 Yeah that's what I meant, I just call em oil lol
1156 2018-11-08 21:33:48 I hate the smell of coconut oil... now. Reminds me of the strip joint. 
1157 2018-11-08 21:33:33 I can bet anything no BJP leader will even mention demo in his speech during the campaign trail leave alone boasting about its success. Demo is as futile as another whatsapp economic solution ‘ Dont purchase petrol for a day, it will bring down oil prices by 50%’ .

1190 2018-11-08 21:28:51 Should I Go Get A Oil Change Tomorrow After Work Or Saturday Morning 
1191 2018-11-08 21:28:38 that is probably why now, nancy pelosi is willing to work with President Trump. But still no reason to believe the snake oil salesperson.
1192 2018-11-08 21:28:26 You can DIY mask or oil treatment
1193 2018-11-08 21:28:21 I’d make more of an effort to lose weight, but I worry I’d be one of those women that suddenly looks HORRIFIC thin. I mean I’m no oil painting already...I can’t afford to risk making it worse
1194 2018-11-08 21:28:18 The trumps did not ever do a hotel deal in Russia nor do they buy Russian arms or Russian oil. Basically the only way that Russia gets money. And ask for Saudi Arabia only one that made them Rich where the bushes and Obama. Trump is not a loyal guy.

1199 2018-11-08 21:27:46 if you aren’t using warm or hot coconut oil during sex and massages, you’re missing out anyhow
1200 2018-11-08 21:27:42 Completely slipped my mind that my entire street’s water is shut off from 8-5 today so I guess I have to stroll into work looking like the local oil spill
1201 2018-11-08 21:27:39 Regardless, I think a better way to tackle multiple issues at the same time would be to overturn citizens united, and add additional regulations to lobbying... maybe we could seek to eliminate lobbying outright. It could fight oil, pharma, and the gun lobby simultaneously
1202 2018-11-08 21:27:14 You're the crudest oil, let your vision boil, yeah they're gonna dig a coal-face!

Thanks for the tip Bro, I'll check for the coconut oil. Make this bad boys softer #Beardgang
1217 2018-11-08 21:25:46 I read this a week ago. The conclusion is that Saudi Arabia will have to keep oil prices low and help US with oil sanctions on iran. So the article’s point is against Iran’s interest. That’s pretty surprising that you posted it. Maybe you didn’t read passed the headline?
1218 2018-11-08 21:25:41 A hot oil treatment is needed when I take these twists out

1222 2018-11-08 21:25:03 1) So you’re saying big oil will pay the bill not us?
2) you’re saying a carbon tax will not lead to more government
3) I thought it was to cut emissions, but now all the sudden we are getting a rebate. Once again, what’s the point
4) you’ve never been in business if you shrug...
1223 2018-11-08 21:24:50 Will other countries follow New Zealand  and ban oil and gas exploration, NO of course they won’t cus they ain’t that f**king stupid

1266 2018-11-08 21:18:52 I'm a full believer in it being used for whatever medical purposes it helps. A dear friend has a young daughter with severe epilepsy. Cannabis oil she is now prescribed reduced her seizures from 400 per day to a managable number. And her life has changed so much for the better.

1303 2018-11-08 21:15:09 Honestly, it looks class. Was it juicy? How did the skin fair with the oil?
1304 2018-11-08 21:15:06 the only thing i hate about taking my jeep in for an oil change is that they never call me when its ready  so it just sits there and they take forever to answer the phone 
1305 2018-11-08 21:15:05 I should have just shorted oil and left it at that ;)
1306 2018-11-08 21:14:47 I wouldn’t waste money on CBD in haircare. It’s either super expensive or just the regular hemp oil off amazon. Go buy the real stuff and don’t waste it on your hair strands.

1310 2018-11-08 21:14:33 Soooo much 'snake oil' today! Rather disappointing.
1311 2018-11-08 21:14:27 Crude oil is officially down over 20% since an Oct. 3rd high FYI
1312 2018-11-08 21:14:23 Potser, però si es cert que no me va respondre a la pregunta de sobre com afectarà el "Peak Oil" a la mobilitat en un estat que l'ha basat en fer infraestructures per automòbils, enlloc de potenciar la xarxa ferroviària no radial i el transport públic.
1313 2018-11-08 21:14:16 CRUDE OIL UPDATE

1314 2018-11-08 21:14:16 Y’all Democrats wanna take our oil and gas away, this will raise the price of gas, increase taxes, import costs go up, national debt goes up, jobs go down, and welfare will be at a all time high, next time y’all wanna vote, walk there, don’t use any of OUR gas no mo.

1316 2018-11-08 21:14:08 Yo no entiendo cuál es la maricada de la Industria de Oil&Gas en Colombia con que siempre piden “conocimiento avanzado de inglés”. Uno hace reportes en inglés para que venga otro chibchombiano a leerlo y desee que esté más bien en español. Qué puto desprecio de nuestro idioma.
1317 2018-11-08 21:14:05 It’s called the whole 30! You basically eat three meals a day with protein, tons of veggies, and some good fat like avocado or olive oil. It’s hard, but I’m happy to already see results!
1318 2018-11-08 21:13:54 Я слепая... Подумала, что песня называется "Dak island"...
1319 2018-11-08 21:13:41 Only down $152 today after most of my swings pulled back. Which is understandable.  I joined the short train on oil and still holding $NKE into consumer sentiment tomorrow.  Probably going to be down another $50-100 on $ATVI tomorrow after getting raped.
1320 2018-11-08 21:13:38 Shark liver oil they use to

O, he did. Into her. She did. Done.

Ah!

1326 2018-11-08 21:12:47 It would be nice if 6 mill bbl $oil in US could supply the world, but world will be fooled, as it is now. Higher prices and more supply needed
1327 2018-11-08 21:12:45 DON'T GET ME STARTED.  ALL THESE WEAK MEN DESPERATELY CHUGGING THEIR PROVERBIAL SNAKE OIL DESPERATELY TRYING NOT TO FEEL LIKE LOST FAILURES
1328 2018-11-08 21:12:42 can my cousin stop inviting me to her essential oil pyramid scheme?doesn't she know im too busy having a mental breakdown to go on "a sensory journey" right now!?!?

1331 2018-11-08 21:12:32 
We are digging for crude oil
1332 2018-11-08 21:12:28 the oil though
1333 2018-11-08 21:12:27 Big Oil and the military industrial complex are both moribund industries hanging around long past their expiration dates to the whole world’s detriment
1334 2018-11-08 21:12:18 Those elite oil experts, talking down the oil price, should have put their cushy jobs and credibilities behind their predictions about oil price movement toward 2019, otherwise, those predictions are worthless.

1337 2018-11-08 21:12:07 For all those environmentalista out there look into oil seeps off Santa Barbara for some more fun facts on oil.
1338 2018-11-08 21:12:04 EZ shares -0.3%, US shares -0.3% as no sign of a dovish tilt from the Fed (not that it was likely).
US 10 yr yld +0.4bp to 3.24%.

1339 2018-11-08 21:12:01 Yep, it's a known fact that the wehrmacht and luftwaffe were actually made stronger by having their oil refineries in ploesti bombed into ashen heaps by the USAF and RAF
1340 2018-11-08 21:12:01 Меня прикалывает картинка. А про песню и группу слышу впервые. Хотя, нет, про Yanix, я вроде бы что-то слышала, но это не точно.
1341 2018-11-08 21:12:01 Democracy is synonymous with morality. Insofar as AI could make government more democratic, it could help. We already know what happens when we give non-humans super-human status. We get oil companies and climate change.
1342 2018-11-08 21:11:59 Listing to @ATWWDpodcast while getting the oil changed in my car? Sounds good to me 
1343 2018-11-08 21:11:56 That's an oil rig.
1344 2018-11-08 21:11:54 I would hope Oil management wouldn’t base their decision on what’s happening with Pavel Zacha, but it wouldn’t surprise me.  JP and Yamo need to play.  Send them to Bakersfield.  Woodcroft seems to be handling the kids down there OK.

1347 2018-11-08 21:11:25 talk about the shooting and also about hemp oil please
1348 2018-11-08 21:11:21 But even so, are they cheaper than soy oil?
1349 2018-11-08 21:11:10 Well time to do an oil change before work
1350 2018-11-08 21:10:41 Bridges ysed abused women to silence someone, didnt involve police. Bennett threatened a grenade into a mentally ill persons marriage. No resignation calls. Woodhouse was one of worst Ministers, ever. Incompetent. Bridges let oil slip some drilling into a park...

1354 2018-11-08 21:10:15 The secret to keeping freshly washed hair clean? Use some dry shampoo on it. @WebMD says this helps absorb oil before you get limp locks. #freshhair #besthair #dryshampoo

1359 2018-11-08 21:09:48 The North Sea oil fields are old, & getting more expensive to develop, doesn’t matter if there’s a few years left , oil companies just go to easier oil fields around the world to develop. In years to come finding drinkable water, will overtake finding oil.
1360 2018-11-08 21:09:43 this guy from Italy who follows me on Instagram just sent me 12 bottles of virgin oilve oil lol so nice
1361 2018-11-08 21:09:40 i’ve had this rental car for so damn long the mf needs an oil change
1362 2018-11-08 21:09:39 For the most part, the clean-up liability is not from BIG oil but from the small players in the oilpatch. The big guys generally have a reclaimation program in place. Furthermore, this issue is also prevalent in the mining and other industries and will be there for wind turbines.
1363 2018-11-08 21:09:32 It’s the oil. Pat it in. Don’t rub.
1364 2018-11-08 21:09:27 we went through similar exercise.... the theta of the options tied to the balance sheet health and tried to use implied vol of oil to price the embedded PUD options inside a company.  everything was overvalued.
1365 2018-11-08 21:09:24 I'm sorry but I don't think CBD oil shampoo and conditioner is a big hit. A scalp mask with CBD oil in it, that makes sense.

But hair is dead skin cells. There's no cannabinoid receptors in your hair. 

Stick to castor oil, it's much more affordable, and it's effective.
1366 2018-11-08 21:08:53 That's Awesome! It comes with one for oil too right?

1371 2018-11-08 21:07:28 However it's not too complicated... You can probably find a recipe online that suggests which spices to use, add a couple eggs and vegetable oil, and you've got matzah balls. That would make a HUGE number, though...oy.

1384 2018-11-08 21:06:29 Yup. Oil the pot, then put crushed red pepper. 
Put tomato paste in. Then put the tomatoes in. Salt, pepper, garlic... let that cook and reduce for a while. Then throw some basil in. Then throw butter in. You’ll be in heaven soon enough
1385 2018-11-08 21:06:26 1. Supposed to be us, but Moe represents Big Oil and Coal.
2. They don't distribute it for free, they're paid civil servants.
3. The point is to reduce pollution, which it will by changing purchases.
4. Yes, a negligible 6%. Cons argue 1.6% is nothing, so that's a bunch of nothin
1386 2018-11-08 21:06:08 Places that do cheap oil changes go
1387 2018-11-08 21:06:07 I was told by an old farmer, you can put oil on scabby and it will clear up. Veggie oil will do.
1388 2018-11-08 21:06:07 There are a lot of analogs of #Vascepa, but not in US. And it's not presented like cure from #cardiovascular. $AMRN forced the market of fich oil medication to follow it's rules. That's why nobody punish them for #ClinicalTrialFake

1399 2018-11-08 21:04:46 Honestly I like it how it is, sure this is far better, but by god we need the 2.5m adapter (the ugly grey one) to be overhauled to fit the new non oil drum astetic of the 2.5m parts.
1400 2018-11-08 21:04:40 I'm not surprised.  Never have I seen so many politic signs littering roadsides.  Big Oil dropped a bundle to fight this proposal. Their "Vote No on Initiative 1631" signs  were more prolific than dandelions.

1406 2018-11-08 21:03:54 Yep, I remember good interactions with him before and during Climate Camp 2006.  We blew it.  We really blew it, and anyone under 35 today can curse anyone over 35 (and esp over 45).  And the oil companies, too, obvs.

1413 2018-11-08 21:03:23 I'm done with your insults of the President, attack his policies, attack his support, but don't use Jr High name calling, it reflects on you poorly. As for Russia as Trump's friend, perhaps you missed the oil deal with Europe that can cripple Putin & Russia? Yeah you did.  #muted
1414 2018-11-08 21:03:17 CBD can have THC in it depending on the type if you want to help health issues spend the money and buy real CBD oil from a reputable company. Cause there won’t be enough if here to do squat. That and it might just be regular hemp oil.
1415 2018-11-08 21:03:14 Feeling adult today. Paid off a bill, got my broken nail fixed, and got an oil change in my car.
1416 2018-11-08 21:03:04 Without oil money
1417 2018-11-08 21:02:54 Imagine if this were oil facilities. The green blob would be screaming. But they don't care about nature, they just hate people.
1418 2018-11-08 21:02:44 
1419 2018-11-08 21:02:30 You know... back in the old days, ships had RADAR installations and it allowed them to detect other ships. Unless stealth oil tankers are now a thing, I can't see how this happened, given the exercise was over and active radar did not make them an easy target.
1420 2018-11-08 21:02:11 Coconut oil fixes all my problems lol
1421 2018-11-08 21:02:07 Point is everyone was after the oil and thought they could get a better deal in some way.
1422 2018-11-08 21:02:02 idk if you are still looking for scar stuff but bio oil is a lifesaver
1423 2018-11-08 21:01:51 Why should communicating frustration with the system be a one-way street?
A: “I’m using my vote to protest for environmental protections.” 
B: “Ok, but you may be ensuring the guy who reps oil interests is elected.”
What is wrong with this exchange?
1424 2018-11-08 21:01:46 Not until you ban their oil & raw materials export and block their global financial transactions.
1425 2018-11-08 21:01:39 @Amarincorp still trying to pump their shares price pn the market selling #vascepa - useless fish oil medication. For so long it makes me so upset. They have to be punished for #fraud

1429 2018-11-08 21:01:21 I tryna figure out why I giggling so much only to now realize there’s THC oil in the vape
1430 2018-11-08 21:01:18 I take it you didnt read this. He tested clean. He admitted to using the oil in the past leading to the issue. Wont make a difference if its hemp oil. Hemp is cannabis.
1431 2018-11-08 21:01:17 Now don't be silly Greg, oil down 20% or $15 a barrel. Price at the pumps in the UK down by feck all.
1432 2018-11-08 21:01:16 Mdawini you like sugar coating yazi. She speaks of pensions but you know very well sir that rural people are getting zero pensions. You know they only visit rural elderly on election season with 2kg sugar, oil and mealie meal. Are we just praising to get ‘nationalist’ jacket?
1433 2018-11-08 21:01:16 Fill my oil tank and buy my kids Christmas gifts
1434 2018-11-08 21:01:05 You advocate for something you have no idea what the cost are. Politicians advocate for it without knowing a cost.

I do not support money for big oil or pharma.
1435 2018-11-08 21:01:05 Canines just got legalized in Pennsylvania for medical use but really hard to get. Till then I'll stick with the CBD oil.

1445 2018-11-08 21:00:22 The legs daya yayi gabar, daya kuma yamma... Sai a gyara  in the next solute
1446 2018-11-08 21:00:22 I take CBD oil
1447 2018-11-08 21:00:00 All the jealous and envious supporters of other clubs have only a few songs they sing
1)we’re buying title with oil money(racist view)
2)we’re unable to fill our seats (highest attendance in PL)
3)city fans are all less then 10yrs old or 10yr long supporters
Come up with new shit
1448 2018-11-08 20:59:50 Beautiful oil paintings in our gallery by Gregory Gibson right now! Stop by and check them out!
1449 2018-11-08 20:59:40 trudeau is a neolib bitch who doesnt actually care about the oppression& suffering of marginalized people or the environment& he never has because if he ever took those things seriously (which is part of his fuckin job) he wouldnt be the Woke Bae Arms and Oil dealer we see today
1450 2018-11-08 20:59:33 What part of private refineries do you not understand? The Canadian Gov't has no say as to what oil is purchased by private industries. Are you asking for a NEP 2.0?
1451 2018-11-08 20:59:29 weird but probably not too tangential connection to Yemen and the US?  Saudi Arabian influence/ oil money.
1452 2018-11-08 20:59:24 Thanks Big Oil
1453 2018-11-08 20:59:05 Simple has a great cleansing oil which you can pick up from a superdrug, with a damp flannel will get off pretty much anything at least as far as @BonnieBonnettes are concerned!
1454 2018-11-08 20:58:57 Morosely the bar has run out of everything bar Heineken Neck Oil.
1455 2018-11-08 20:58:55 Perhaps oil companies spent so much on I-1631 because they liked it, and they wanted activists energies focused on it. Oil companies liked I-1631 because it hurts voters more than it hurts oil companies. Propose putting an oil company out of business, and watch everyone ignore.
1456 2018-11-08 20:58:51 There's some Romanesque armour in FFXIV and it's very daipery there too, so you're not alone. Quick, togas and oil!
1457 2018-11-08 20:58:50 That is all I have talked about. YOU YOU YOU YOU. YOU give me hope for this country. I am American but grew up overseas....Iran and West Indies (OIL BRAT) I want to leave the US because I hate what we have become. YOU GIVE ME HOPE.
1458 2018-11-08 20:58:39 @jeffphilips1 saw this somewhere "Dangote With His Investments In Nigeria, Running Into Tens Of Billions of
Dollars, Spanning Oil, Gas, Cement, Sugar, Transport, etc employ only about
30,000 Nigerians.
MTN With Investments Of Over 10Billion Dollars employ about 8,000 people......
1459 2018-11-08 20:58:35 does anyone have a costco card? i really need some more coconut oil
1460 2018-11-08 20:58:01 Urgence de mise en oeuvre d'une vraie démocratie. Voilà la seule tâche dont devraient se charger les politiques.
1461 2018-11-08 20:57:56 I have a couple cases of snake oil to throw in, too.
1462 2018-11-08 20:57:46 @clairenewell The difference, in part, relates to a treaty limiting how far cruise ships using heavy oil can travel along the peninsula. @QuarkExpedition Antarctic Circle tour highly recommended!
1463 2018-11-08 20:57:25 Hahahaha! Bishhh. Tell me why I cried to my dad too?!! Hahahahaha. But they said they dropped motor oil on my filters. They’re literally taking my motor apart to clean the whole thing 
1464 2018-11-08 20:57:24 Will be playing one track from Midnight Oil's Armistice Day show, released today, but will have to see how much time we have whether it's that or another track. Definitely playing it in Mick's new Soldier On Special at noon on Sunday. And Sunday night 6pm
1465 2018-11-08 20:57:16 just gonna stick my face directly into my lavender oil diffuser til this day is done
1466 2018-11-08 20:57:15 They playin wit this oil change 
1467 2018-11-08 20:57:13 Yeah CBD oil is great! My mum was taking it before and it was helping her a lot with pain and such.
1468 2018-11-08 20:57:13 BRUSH FIRE | FS150 #SantaClarita | N Sierra Highway x Placerita Canyon Rd | E150 reports a 100’ x 30’ spot in an oil field. 150’s confident they can catch it, but continuing the 1st Alarm response as a precaution. #LACoFD
1469 2018-11-08 20:57:11 My Baby first oil change appt 
1470 2018-11-08 20:57:09 UKgov will know exactly what the Oil and Gas situation is. McCrone.
1471 2018-11-08 20:56:56 Right???  Looks like progressive ideas are actually good for the oil patch.
1472 2018-11-08 20:56:47 Haan subha, too much oil before sleeping is not good.
1473 2018-11-08 20:56:44 They French/Italians/UK/others were trying to get oil deals done with Qaddafi for a long time and thought this would be the easier route.  That's literally all it was.
1474 2018-11-08 20:56:39 Too bad we can’t get oil out of them. They might actually serve America then.
1475 2018-11-08 20:56:32 It's been awhile since I have and I never really paid much attention when I did. I tried some CBD oil recently though that I really enjoyed
1476 2018-11-08 20:56:30 What will the price of #Oil be by March 31, 2019?
1477 2018-11-08 20:56:30 St Ives apricot scrub is really good. Make sure you get the one for your face though, not the one for your body. And buy toner or astringent. And also an oil free moisturizer!
1478 2018-11-08 20:56:18 To be fair, I have no idea how thick your beard is.

Beard oil and balm promotes growth, health, shine, smell, etc.
1479 2018-11-08 20:56:17 #LACOFD responding to a reported Brush Fire in 150s area (Santa Clarita) at Sierra Highway and Placerita Canyon, subject seen lightning multiple spot fires in the oil fields, was seen driving a dodge pick up. #Breaking
1480 2018-11-08 20:56:16 You can not answer the question can you?

no one know what it will cost me. Why should I get behind something that I can not calculate what it cost. 

Typical answer to avoid this answer.

Fuck big oil
Fuck big pharma

Answer the question. Or can you?
1481 2018-11-08 20:56:07 the squirt will be a WD40 oil jet?
1482 2018-11-08 20:56:03 I have been dousing my skin in rosehip oil nightly at the end of my routine to try and stop it from drying out. Still, no bueno.
1483 2018-11-08 20:55:40 If you subtracted all taxes.
Federal state and local excise that is just a start.
There are corporate taxes paid by the oil companies, business taxes on the station, income taxes on all involved, property taxes also and taxes on every mode of transportation for the oil .
1484 2018-11-08 20:55:39 Jim started with " I want to challenge you."
It's not a debate forum.
He had no question,  he just wanted to quibble over terminology
1485 2018-11-08 20:55:36 It's the 21st Century vs. the 19th Century.

Which will prevail?

Or will/shall we separate?

A diverse technological democracy to join with & compete in the modern world; and a separate angry, older, white authoritarian nation running on coal, oil and resentments?
1486 2018-11-08 20:55:33 I have tried CBD oil which takes out the hallucinogens from the cannibals plant and it's legal in all 50 states. But expensive. It helps with my anxiety, insomnia, back & neck pains. Told my Dr. about it and he says whatever works keep using it.
1487 2018-11-08 20:55:26 Yummy! Can you tell me what the frying oil temperature should be in English please?
1488 2018-11-08 20:55:14 أيوة ،، ليه انت مش مصدق 
1489 2018-11-08 20:55:03 I’m anti partisan, not bipartisan. Whether oil companies are allowed to exist is not partisan. I get as much respect from deniers as scientists for the idea to put an oil company out of its misery. Oil companies are as far removed from local emotional as you can get.
1490 2018-11-08 20:54:51 Wyatt just went and got my oil changed, bought me a “mom life” coloring book, and brought me my fav soup from Carrabba’s back to the hospital. I CANT BRAG ENOUGH???
1491 2018-11-08 20:54:38 And with them making money with oil again then will push the basis a lot for u
1492 2018-11-08 20:54:19 The Middle East is dumping cheap oil in the market, shouldn't President Trump be calling for trade talks and putting tariffs on Middle East oil?
1493 2018-11-08 20:54:16 I wrote the same thing as an energy reporter back in 1979. The problem is that as the price goes up, as a result, there is more oil that is cost-effective to get out of the ground. Who would a-thunk it!
1494 2018-11-08 20:54:14 Rosie, are we going to play Armistice Day - Midnight Oil....?
@mmmhotbreakfast
1495 2018-11-08 20:54:13 Nope....that fraud oil club
1496 2018-11-08 20:54:08 Pills that let you fight god.

Oil that turns you into a shark.
1497 2018-11-08 20:54:00 Tried oils for the first time today!! Lmao it was too hard so I decided to mix oil pastels and paint and I kinda liked how it turned out!! Can't wait for it to dry tomorrow so I can work on it again 
1498 2018-11-08 20:53:46 My mind races at like a million miles a minute and it’s so scattered. I’m surprised I can get anything done like I’ll literally be laying in bed and be like “aw fuck I forgot to write down what stores needed oil last week” like wtf???
1499 2018-11-08 20:53:25 And to QP! Kenney not in the house this afternoon, so we kick off with Nixon on unemployment. How will the gvt explain the decline in private sector employment? Notley: Earlier this week you declared defeat and said nobody will invest in AB again - then Imperial Oil did #ableg
1500 2018-11-08 20:53:19 The might of Great Britain (and its amazing Commonwealth) France and eventually the US successfully took on and destroyed both Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan…And yet we cower to Saudi Arabia?!?…We could destroy them in an afternoon, so why don't we? Their Oil' = nothing
1501 2018-11-08 20:53:12 I have ptsd and use the oil.
1502 2018-11-08 20:53:12 Say you know how you could make Boon Twerk even hotter message oil Ekkk  just a thought ! 
1503 2018-11-08 20:53:12 We have a 2014 @Acura RdX so I'm stuck with a Miserable Fox News sponsor car. I have decided that I won't be taking it to the dealership for regular service. I will find another way to get the oil and filters changed.
1504 2018-11-08 20:53:05 Waiting for an oil change watching the girl behind me eat McDonald’s like it’s going out of style. How’s your day going
1505 2018-11-08 20:53:04 You're no oil painting yourself.
1506 2018-11-08 20:53:04 Our own news paper is toxic, romour pedler and despirate to stay above the curve.. USA world biggest crude oil producer?  yet Trump is keeping OPEC biggest economies on their toes to keep a fair crude price? #fireyoureditor
1507 2018-11-08 20:52:59 My hair oil going to be popping  I never seen my hair grow so fast in a week 
1508 2018-11-08 20:52:49 Fuck taking the car out to get an oil change imma just put olive oil in that bitch
1509 2018-11-08 20:52:40 Imagine how painful hand cooking crisps must be. Trying to maintain your grasp on a fistful of slivered potato as you plunge your hand deep into a vat of searing hot oil...
1510 2018-11-08 20:52:34 Spend $50 to save myself a drive to missouri for a free oil change. I think its a good trade.
1511 2018-11-08 20:52:24 Allah yataiki mai gida @abbasrassheed
1512 2018-11-08 20:52:13 Buying some oil down here, not futures though,I'm not that bold. Swing long.
1513 2018-11-08 20:52:12 Fire burns at oil and gas site in Weld County.  Thanks for doing such an awesome job protecting Colorado citizens.  @govofCO @COGCC   What a farce
1514 2018-11-08 20:52:11 That's not what I'm getting at. Buying with dollars is ignoring what I believe is the crucial issue, which is changing the politics--first, getting oil out of it, but also, creating a power structure that can act, learn, and change. The current system is not working.
1515 2018-11-08 20:52:02 Repeated post. My grandad shook for 70 years with PTSD after the Somme.If we really cared it would be 24/7 not once a year with crocodile tears. FUND VETERANS NOW.STOP OIL WARS AND PISS POOR PENSIONS AND VETERANS ROUGH SLEEPING AND DYING ALONE. Poppy CEO gets £95k p.a.Hypocrisy .
1516 2018-11-08 20:52:02 When GEJ left oil price was above $60, yet external reserves was dropping and FG was borrowing to pay salaries. If the election had been delayed by 15 months, on account of economic issues alone, Jonathan would only win in Otuoke

1518 2018-11-08 20:51:33 So His job includes disobeing his president.
1519 2018-11-08 20:51:31 Get anything w/ Tea tree oil in the formula for cleaning w/. It also repels mosquitoes. It's not new but it will support hygiene.
1520 2018-11-08 20:51:27 You guys have no idea how much i miss being home right now. I even miss being annoyed at everyone cause I was the only one decorating our entire 9 flat house with lights and oil lamps. I miss doing mha puja and panicking when it was my turn to puja the fire lol 
1521 2018-11-08 20:51:24 The oil downturn is only partly to blame. Many companies like CP Rail, Imperial Oil, Golder Assoc., etc. moved to the burbs because of high rents and taxes. I blame the city for that.
1522 2018-11-08 20:51:04 thanks my friend. I was burning the midnight oil a little hard last night
1523 2018-11-08 20:50:53 وزير الصحة: الهيئة العامة لمكافحة الفساد أحالت مسؤولين سابقين وحاليين في الوزارة إلى النيابة العامة بسبب شبهات تعدٍّ على المال العام.. والموضوع لا يزال رهن التحقيق
1524 2018-11-08 20:50:49 I hate that people don’t believe me when I tell them that i do my own oil changes 
1525 2018-11-08 20:50:38 I really need to get an oil change but I really just don’t want to go.

1527 2018-11-08 20:50:08 @SCC_eng I own over half of North America now and none is for sale and the fake taku River Tlingit gene pool scammers I get my property back and I hope they do hard time for dumping oil in world's cleanest lake Atlin, I never gave permission for that
1528 2018-11-08 20:50:03 so now the evil pumpkin gets to pick another boot lickin lacky of big oil?
1529 2018-11-08 20:50:03 Hi Michelle, we’re so sorry to hear this. Please contact our Instant Oil Customer Care team at 1-800-327-8242 or via email at customercare@valvoline.com. They can get more information and provide assistance.
1530 2018-11-08 20:50:02 Several years ago my analyst valued pxd by deconstructing it into oil calls. Produced a value of 1/6th it’s trading level at the time.
1531 2018-11-08 20:49:56 first of all...who is she
1532 2018-11-08 20:49:41 Resigning as Secretary of State after you've suppressed votes in your own gubernatorial race is like being an Exxon exec, being nominated to head the EPA, dumping a bunch of oil in the sea and, in response to the outrage, resigning from Exxon.
1533 2018-11-08 20:49:31 Shipping industry is not a global commodity like oil.
1534 2018-11-08 20:49:18 nah...I am all out of oil.
1535 2018-11-08 20:49:17 There is no preventative for the common cold...you don't build up immunity. Its a retrovirus...never the same virus..can't be anticipated..can't build up immunity. Same goes for causes of pneumonia. Too varied. Possible feel-good snake oil!

1537 2018-11-08 20:49:03 If the price of oil has dropped 20 percent recently why isn’t that reflected in the price of petrol at the bowser - or is this now being aimed at reducing private vehicles for transportation, to push into public transport?
1538 2018-11-08 20:49:01 I thought the same thing! They also voted overwhelmingly against oil drilling which Republican candidates support.
1539 2018-11-08 20:48:48 When it was running out, it was Scotland's oil

When more is found, it's the UK's oil

Odd that eh
1540 2018-11-08 20:48:20 ㄴㄴ 님은 저랑♡
1541 2018-11-08 20:48:18 It sounds like we have similar skin problems. I have found a routine that works for me: cetaphil face wash (super mild), tea tree toner from lush (great for excess oil and acne), and daily moisturizing lotion from Cerave (its noncomedogenic and super light)

1545 2018-11-08 20:47:51 Yeah, definitely discovered oil in America post Series 1. I think the computer kid from Digimon did freelance work and invested all the money to become pretty damn wealthy for a high schooler.
1546 2018-11-08 20:47:47 Pharmaceutical companies, big oil, insurance companies would younlike me to go in? They all buy our politicians vote. To think otherwise is very naive! #theconcontinues

1550 2018-11-08 20:47:12 1. Do *NOT* make eye contact with the wine
2. Wine is simply canola oil and food coloring. Don't overthink it!
3. If your wine doesn't come with its own wine fork, you're drinking "Jersey" wine.
4. Ask your wine if it's a cop. It has to tell you, otherwise it's entrapment.
1551 2018-11-08 20:47:10 I would love this top quality olive oil on my salad.
1552 2018-11-08 20:47:08 How comes its over heating? Is it real hot where u r? Or is there not enough oil or coolant in ya jeep?
1553 2018-11-08 20:47:05 Spending growth in AB has been countercyclical. Please explain the 19.6% increase in spending for fiscal 2013-4, when the PCs were in charge, months before the downturn in oil prices.

1555 2018-11-08 20:46:33 Why should we? Can't she get one of her rich oil baron friends to give her fair-market rate in one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the city?
1556 2018-11-08 20:46:30 Pretty sure the next drop of oil today costs less than the last drop made when he uttered that drivel.

1559 2018-11-08 20:46:23 Great looking oil guys :)
1560 2018-11-08 20:46:17 anyone read that "butt his shit fire tho"
1561 2018-11-08 20:46:17 does anyone know if the oil changing service at FIU is good?
1562 2018-11-08 20:46:08 All this FFP bollocks is boring.
I haven't seen any actual proof yet. Can some forward me a link to the documentation that makes us the cheating , oil rich club we are.

When I say proof, I don't mean a document written by someone "claiming" to have seen said documents. 


1563 2018-11-08 20:46:05 Edna valley chardonnay tastes like olive oil don’t buy it unless you rly like olive oil then dip bread in it fer sher
1564 2018-11-08 20:45:56 Seaweed salad. Calamari, either deep fried with marinara or served in citrus and oil (Sicilian). That’s all. Tuna has a mild taste, try thst in sushi with cucumber or carrot.
1565 2018-11-08 20:45:55 Current account deficit should have been first priority. Measures should have been taken to reduce oil import. Needed will and sincerity. Afterwards people needed trade and jobs. You have to stand on your own feet first to bring prosperity to masses. Failure in making.
1566 2018-11-08 20:45:38 If you are going to quote me, quote me correctly. I said demonize. Maybe a bit harsh but part of the definition of demonize is to portray someone as bad or evil. Never heard too many good words about snake oil merchants.
1567 2018-11-08 20:45:11 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1568 2018-11-08 20:45:09 Coconut oil for everything lol
1569 2018-11-08 20:45:08 Peak oil, peak demand. Blah, blah, blah. It is just called supply and demand. Econ 101. It ebbs and flows. Markets are never perfectly balanced, especially when it takes lead time to bring on new supply, & there are drawbacks at the individual producer level to decreasing supply.
1570 2018-11-08 20:45:06 Muscle cramps can stop you in your tracks. Fight back with #magnesiumoil. 

Apply it to the #cramp, rub it in & feel the muscle cramp ease away. 

Pro tip, if you get cramps at night, leave your magnesium oil by the bedside table so that it's within reach when you need it most!
1571 2018-11-08 20:44:57 No condemnation of attacks in restaurants, airports ect. The smartest people in the world didnt anticipate this escalation?

1575 2018-11-08 20:44:37 Very much do not understand the point of making an appointment for an oil change if it's still going to take 45+ minutes.
1576 2018-11-08 20:44:32 That’s the easy button: collect a cleanup fee from big oil However, the people consuming the oil would pay the fee, not the oil company profit margins. How do you fix that? Nationalize the oil companies like Venezuela... which is working out great for those citizens right now!
1577 2018-11-08 20:44:30 2.74 in Illinois.  Been 2.74 for 2 weeks while oil has been down 7 days.
1578 2018-11-08 20:43:46 The Witcher:
It was a calm day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about  White Wolfs. 'Use  Beast Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.

1580 2018-11-08 20:43:30 I didn’t wanna adult today but my car needed an oil change
1581 2018-11-08 20:43:30 Yes. But I don’t get the coconut oil 
1582 2018-11-08 20:43:26 Hi I have exactly the same issue. Emailed my concerns a week ago and have had no response other than a basic holding response. Looks like oil to me. Why is non stick Teflon leaking out?
1583 2018-11-08 20:43:23 Why still in Afghanistan? For the love of Pete, why still there? 
And the price of oil.
And cobalt, there is a shortage looming ...

1586 2018-11-08 20:43:07 The khakis from Rawalpindi hitch a ride to good friends Amman. IDF/Shinbet drive down for some Jordanian coffee. It's unlikely the purpose is olive oil. And now Israeli even fly into Pak in unmarked private jets - like no one notice? Not that they care!
1587 2018-11-08 20:43:06 U.s. output >Russia or Saudi. Trump wants low oil price. He doesn't like OPEC. Does Trump intend to replace OPEC?
1588 2018-11-08 20:43:02 I’m so over this type of political attention-seeking behavior. In college I had a Leftover Crack hoodie depicting the Twin Towers as gas pumps(implying America’s ‘War on Terror’ was solely to get Middle Eastern oil fields). I only wore it to shows, never on campus...for a reason.
1589 2018-11-08 20:42:51 At least then theres Gas many many years then theres new finds and then theres other areas untapped. Yes Scotland is sitting on oil
1590 2018-11-08 20:42:51 They would do well to in force the ffp rule and stop taking Brown envelopes off of rich oil barons transparency in football one rule for all not some

1595 2018-11-08 20:42:19 Only 1 way to prepare a chicken wing, and that is buffalo style. Jumbo wings fried in peanut oil to crispy skin, juicy meat... tossed in a franks red hot based sauce served with ken’s restaurant grade chunky blue cheese dressing.
1596 2018-11-08 20:42:14 Crude Oil similar shape on equivalent timeframe
1597 2018-11-08 20:42:10 What made you pick that number? It’s the younger age group of 18-24 year olds giving the most trouble and opinions about the way this country should be ran even though they can’t figure out how to change the oil in there vehicle
1598 2018-11-08 20:42:02 You don’t blend the oil out. You hang the babies on a clothesline and let the oil simply drip out of them, slowly.
1599 2018-11-08 20:42:00 Coconut oil don’t smell ,it actually makes the hair soft and makes it grow faster
1600 2018-11-08 20:41:58 Bien sabe Ud, Sr. @MontenegroCNN  que Yacimiento Shale Oil y Gas Vaca Muerta de Argentina, es gran promesa pero, por fósil, efímera. Llevo a cabo, un estudio de la resultante en Tiempo, Dinero y Energía, si transformo eso a E. Renovables.

1601 2018-11-08 20:41:45 China coal, iron ore, crude oil imports all up on year in October, while coal imports fell on month. Will know more next Wednesday when industry&electricity stats come out but still doesn't look good emissions-wise.
1602 2018-11-08 20:41:32 B is oil fired which as far as I know
1603 2018-11-08 20:41:19 Many hispanics in West Texas put food on the table working in the Permian basin oil fields, and dont share the same views on the left on the evils of fossil fuels.  Latinos are not a monolithic voting bloc and Texas hispanics are not like Southern California hispanics.
1604 2018-11-08 20:41:16 Insane Clown Posse is a lot like earthworms.  When it rains faygo they slither out of their trailers and head down to the local dirt lot to have the questionable ladies wrestle each other in dollar tree canola oil

1607 2018-11-08 20:41:09 basically "put a bunch of oil in a covered pan and turn the heat on hight" sounds like a recipe for a grease fire
1608 2018-11-08 20:40:55 Really hate when a chinese takeaway has shit chilli oil.
1609 2018-11-08 20:40:41 I just need to be dipped in a  full of Marijuana oil

1616 2018-11-08 20:39:30 Had a dream last night my dad married Melania Trump, then the two of them went sneaking into an oil tycoon’s private desert land to solve a crime with a sheriff named Ahab, then they all got caught and held hostage. Needless to say, I didn’t sleep well last night.
1617 2018-11-08 20:39:30 So do you have plans to celebrate the 30th anniversary of this setting out to cast doubt on climate science and lobby against efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions? will it involve vegetable oil?
1618 2018-11-08 20:39:29 I have been there. If it is acrylic you can save it. Oil it is harder to do so,
1619 2018-11-08 20:39:27 
1620 2018-11-08 20:39:19 how many babies you think they gotta put in a blender to make a bottle of baby oil
1621 2018-11-08 20:39:19 Is halting all new oil and gas exploration the right thing to do?
1622 2018-11-08 20:39:16 We soo need regulation for these kind of snake oil people. But the Paltrow's of the world can keep harming people and ripping them off without it. It really is time for change in this country.
1623 2018-11-08 20:39:13 Ok, el campo paga ganancias?
Listo.
Los millones de lts  de gasoil tienen itc q se usa para mantener choriplaneros.
(Excepto lo de OIL q Cristóbal se la afano toda)
Las retenciones q son?
En el balance seguro q el campo te mantiene.

1629 2018-11-08 20:38:53 Manipulation of oil prices amid sanctions against Iran will lead to an oil price of $100 per barrel and above.
1630 2018-11-08 20:38:43 It also doesn't matter, £9Bn is a lot to Steve and the 3502 family but the increase in GDP for the rest of the EU means its already covered. As for the surplus, how needs oil, gas, food and medicines anyway........
1631 2018-11-08 20:38:39 i hate that my oil change is $90, like fuck stacy chill
1632 2018-11-08 20:38:39 Currently doing a deep conditioning and hot oil treatment at the same time. I love wash days 
1633 2018-11-08 20:38:23 Unbelievable just been having a debate with a scouser , he’s telling me city are corrupt, blood money , oil money etc etc I said the media report on what sells papers and people should not believe everything they read , I mention the sun paper and he blocked me

1635 2018-11-08 20:38:13 Yep, I saw the Old Snake Oil Salesman's line about White People not voting for Blacks yesterday. Well all I have to say about that is We damn sure won't be voting for Bernie Sanders.
1636 2018-11-08 20:38:02 لو قبلوا خطة التقسيم كنتم ستغزونهم ولن تحافظوا على عهودكم .. كعادتكم 
1637 2018-11-08 20:38:01 I started calling cooking oil "lube" a while ago and no one has corrected me.
1638 2018-11-08 20:37:58 Make a hash with some onions and peppers. Cut them all up and roll around in olive oil. Bake at 375 until they are soft.
1639 2018-11-08 20:37:47 Guess I don’t have to worry about gas or oil changes now 
1640 2018-11-08 20:37:45 I do need to replace my truffle oil!
1641 2018-11-08 20:37:43 She struggles to stay buoyant like a duckling caught under an Exxon oil waterfall being pulled 5 different directions by a discarded six pack ring she’s donned whilst pummeled amongst the jagged rocks  by a pitch black froth..

1647 2018-11-08 20:36:57 She would rather be boiled in oil than retire while Trump is President! Can you imagine the liberals reactions if she did, we would have to wear body armor!
1648 2018-11-08 20:36:56 @RachelNotley just wondering what you think about MSW differentials right now and what you are doing about this situation.  Our oil company will not last if this continues.  We need a pipeline and we need it yesterday.
1649 2018-11-08 20:36:45 آمين.
1650 2018-11-08 20:36:40 Please buy the oil, you deserve it

1656 2018-11-08 20:35:34 OK isnt perfect by any means but we've seen a large influx of people from Cali, CO and other high cost states because the dollar goes much further here. We are tied too much to oil and biz men like Stitt want to change that. More diverse. 1st time in 8 yrs state will have surplus
1657 2018-11-08 20:35:31 You probably get your fair share of US Marines and oil engineers. 

There are a few reasons why they choose certain occupations.
1658 2018-11-08 20:35:22 I guess it was the THC that made me get anxiety & headaches. I use to vomit anytime I did smoke  so I stopped lol. But I want to try to CBD oil or gummies. But I’ll make sure to do my research on it first. & I’ll have to ask about breastfeeding lol
1659 2018-11-08 20:35:18 Sure we all hate Arsenal, Cfc etc but every football fan should ignore @ManCity. Just don't watch them. Don't read about them. They're a manufactured club - A small club backed by Emirate Oligarch oil money. Nothing more.
1660 2018-11-08 20:35:13 On what basis, exactly, is America engaged in hydrocarbon isolationism and pissing the rest of the world off with sanctions, trade wars and NOPEC? On expensive, unprofitable, credit-dependent shale oil in the Permian? Assuming the US will now never need the worlds oil is stupid!
1661 2018-11-08 20:35:09 I’m drinking wine I’d relegated to the cooking shelf. It was sitting with the cooking oil next to the stove. I tried it and low and behold it had oxygenated into something drinkable. 
1662 2018-11-08 20:35:09 Glad the burning of oil isnt like killing the planet or something
1663 2018-11-08 20:35:07 Truth!  Oil folks & attorneys voting blue. 
1664 2018-11-08 20:34:59 I mean, local oil money dumped in pretty heavily, too. Rich people everywhere benefit from long-term oppression.

1673 2018-11-08 20:34:10 i think we all talked about this at dft...

but to contribute to conversation: 1000mg pure cbd extract with added spearmint essential oil (by me) has been the only thing to subside the pain of my molar impacting my jawbone while i await surgery lol.
1674 2018-11-08 20:34:06 Just for one second imagine the horrors that little girl suffered. Now tell me she doesn’t belong in large pot of boiling oil....
1675 2018-11-08 20:34:04 Oil, beard butter, beard shampoo, beard soap & beard combs RT @theNFLchick: @AdamBMore @weddlesbeard My friend has a beard line, check it out @CCLBeardButter but he does oil as well
1676 2018-11-08 20:34:01 Lifted restrictions so as of Aug, USA is largest oil exporter in the WORLD. That number expected to double in 2020.
1677 2018-11-08 20:34:00 Not like the GOP benefit financially from stifling global warming research  and focus from big oil and coal.
1678 2018-11-08 20:33:39 ya!!!! instead of butter and oil you use avocado >:)
1679 2018-11-08 20:33:23 Vanilla ice-cream with olive oil and salt..a new favourite thing.

1682 2018-11-08 20:33:06 lo relevante en el OIL no es el precio de referencia sino en la curva, ya esa en contango.
1683 2018-11-08 20:32:49 I like it as a meal with penne pasta and garlic and oil. Topped with Romano and fresh ground pepper.  Yum!
1684 2018-11-08 20:32:48 i paid medical bills while getting an oil change today. do they still give out ribbons for being a real adult?
1685 2018-11-08 20:32:38 I think I’m gonna try CBD oil I heard it works but for the time being if I have a super bad day I get Lorazepam from my father in law
1686 2018-11-08 20:32:38 Ok sis do they have the resource that we do. Do they make N45b daily from oil. Do they have over N200m people. And dear Nigeria is not 58year. We came together as Nigeria in 1914. At the rate we are growing there is going to be a problem. 
Our Political elites have robbed us.
1687 2018-11-08 20:32:30 how do you guys deal with restricting when other people cook your meals?? i cook all my own meals but tonight I went to my mum's for dinner and i asked for a small portion but the whole thing was just DRENCHED in oil, like it just fucked up my whole calorie intake for the day
1688 2018-11-08 20:32:24 Very happy that Alberta was able to pick themselves up after the oil recession. I guess Mrs. Notley does know what she's doing.
1689 2018-11-08 20:32:12 As a teacher I would never accept your dirty oil money. I would never let you in my classroom to corrupt my students with false lies about climate change! Get out of education and take your blood money somewhere else.
1690 2018-11-08 20:31:46 Until politics over arms, oil and other things continue to happen there is no world "peace". Respecting and remembering those who made their sacrifice for what we have now is the least we can do
1691 2018-11-08 20:31:25 tattoo: healed in two weeks. clean and put coconut oil on it. Pretty picture
piercing: healed in 100 years if ur lucky. Put sergical spirit on the hole in ur face u piece of shit. Nasty hole in ur face. U nasty goth loser
1692 2018-11-08 20:31:10 CBD oil is amazing. Already it’s helped me. Why didn’t I get this sooner?!
1693 2018-11-08 20:31:07 Didn't you inform the Scottish ppl in 2014 that our oil would run out in a few years. Or were you lying?!!
1694 2018-11-08 20:31:04 USD/CAD hit its highest level since Sept 10 today on the further drop in Oil prices combined with the hawkish #Fed. Gotta love it as a Canadian resident waiting to sell US dollars!
1695 2018-11-08 20:31:03 Blood and Oil has me glued.
1696 2018-11-08 20:30:59 Finally Nigerians will stop feeling like USA is just after their oil. ,
1697 2018-11-08 20:30:48 Finally got my morraccan oil

1700 2018-11-08 20:30:32 How do you compare Iran to Iraq ?

Who can ban iran for long time? with regard to geographical matters.

also Iran's economy has the highest independence among oil countries

1703 2018-11-08 20:30:07 Get some oil even cooking oil put in your hands   Warm it up and rub all over baby’s tummy gently and his back like a gentle massage see if it helps he might be full of wind and it might help release it
1704 2018-11-08 20:30:02 Good luck Friday!
1705 2018-11-08 20:30:00 Remember 2004?

Halliburton was going to drill oil while protected by evangelical super-soliders. George W Bush was a massive grinning monkey. The left hated globalisation and told us that we could learn a lot from the struggles of the Zapatistas in Mexico.
1706 2018-11-08 20:29:59 Snuzz, their current rep is a climate denying birther who got rich from oil and she supports Medicare for all. I'm still pinching myself.
1707 2018-11-08 20:29:51 #EmergingMarkets can't catch a fucking break! Now oil is in #bearmarket territory, and if it keeps sliding lower.. this is a major headwind for emerging markets growth! I really didn't see oil going this low this soon.. but then again, it's a volatile animal!
1708 2018-11-08 20:29:48 Good point but you can’t resist that dirty oil money
1709 2018-11-08 20:29:17 Last day at the #HEUconvention and the last chance to pick up delicious @cafeetico chocolates, coffee and Palestinian olive oil from @Zatoun. Here until 2:00, so be sure to stop by!!
1710 2018-11-08 20:29:07 Also, simply having oil means nothing unless it is managed correctly.  Take a look at Venezuela, largest proven oil reserves in the world but a broken economy and inflation projected by some to hit one million percent by the end of the year.

1717 2018-11-08 20:28:30 Truth and conservatism are like oil and water it's been like this since the  start of civilization. The people in charge trick idiot's like you to slow human progress and keep power in the hands of the few. They use lies scare tactics to distract you from their blatant power grab
1718 2018-11-08 20:28:24 Excellent activities , i am glad to see the diversity in oil and gas is growing. you set an example of other chapters to follow :)
1719 2018-11-08 20:28:19 Tosto funghi pasta is fucking incredible. I guess that's what happens when you mix cheese, butter, cream, mushrooms and truffle oil.
1720 2018-11-08 20:28:16 Olive oil also works. Even if put only drops on ur punkie and rub into the nostrils.
1721 2018-11-08 20:28:14 We had an oil crisis is 1974 remember, many European countries went through a recession in this period.
1722 2018-11-08 20:28:14 When selling Snake Oil you need distractions
1723 2018-11-08 20:28:09 I might give you a lengthy massage with hot oil — It’ll open up your pours and relax your muscles. If you’re lacking vitamin D, you won’t be afterwards.
1724 2018-11-08 20:27:58 Is not that easy, there are two kinds of third-world dictatorships, mining and oil republic and banana republics, in resource dictatorships slaves can die in a gold mine while still producing wealth for the leader, and oil can be put out by foreign companies without citizens
1725 2018-11-08 20:27:55 CHINA REMOVED ITS 25% TARIFF ON OIL!!
Why isn't the  MSM talking about this
 BIG WIN for @realDonaldTrump?? @FoxNews PLEASE get on this. Media bias by omission is the damn problem with the Deep State fake news. NOT Trump! @SaraCarterDC @dbongino

1731 2018-11-08 20:26:51 Did you know that some CBD oil companies have mold , dry wall, wax and other harmful ingredients in their brand?? 

Please read and research the products that you are putting in your body!!!
1732 2018-11-08 20:26:25 and it didn’t hurt to put on a shirt like for a septum piercing. It takes a while to heal. I had bad cartilage buildup but tea tree oil would make it disappear. Hmmm I wonder what else but I think that’s about it ~~

1737 2018-11-08 20:26:08 This dude was not vetted by Trump. Trump is a fanboy of Whitaker from @foxnews. He’s a snake oil salesman who was on the board of the scam business World Patent Marketing that was shut down by the FTC. His appointment is going to end up in the court system.
1738 2018-11-08 20:25:25 Why am I first on the list?
1739 2018-11-08 20:25:23 @jiffylube your location on 13th ave in Fargo is beyond incompetent. 40 mins for a simple oil change, took battery cover off for an oil change?? Hoods been open an closed multiple times....makes me very nervous

1748 2018-11-08 20:24:43 It's not oil for a start.
If you're gonna comment on something, it might help if you had the first clue about it.

1754 2018-11-08 20:23:46 Of course the shooter was a Marine veteran. The military gets all this funding and puts so little of it into the people who blindly risk their lives to steal oil and kill innocent lives.

1756 2018-11-08 20:23:30 I was lying under a 20 year old Transit van, with oil, rain & shit, running down my face.Well done to you though.
1757 2018-11-08 20:23:27 Sick of this "Low oil prices are good for U.S. consumer & economy."  Last time we had it 2014 we heard that same crap and the exact OPPOSITE happened. Low prices HELPED NO ONE

1758 2018-11-08 20:23:24 Oil $60.75 - next week am fairly certain it will be in the fifties. Surprised by the lack of media coverage in the slump in recent weeks. Hope it gets reflected at the pump in coming days.

1761 2018-11-08 20:22:39 Add a touch of Earl Grey tea(bergamot). Maybe some "gun oil"?
1762 2018-11-08 20:22:39 it is billion $ industry on this omega 3 and other dietary supplements. most of them are not proven. "snake oil"

1764 2018-11-08 20:22:33 & for people with a longer memory remember when the oil tanker drivers were on strike,that's going to be a walk in the park compared to Brexit
1765 2018-11-08 20:22:32 It’s all Russian Propaganda they’re trying to steal our oil
1766 2018-11-08 20:22:24 I’ve long suggested e&p’s are appropriately valued a series of cash flows (PDPs) and a series of options with different oil strikes that bring different PUDs in and out of the money depending on the commodity.
1767 2018-11-08 20:22:11 Graag gedaan! Als je niet weet wa ik bedoel met die kokosolie: typ gewoon in youtube "pure coconut oil hairmask", want je moet da laten smelten etc. Je kan het vinden in de kruidvat voor €3 of zo xxxx

1771 2018-11-08 20:21:45 •Try oil pulling- use coconut oil and swish it around your mouth, it’s good for removing a lot of bacteria.

•Baking soda-has natural whitening properties, helps scrub surface stains.

•Apple Cider vinegar- drink with water and swish around your mouth, rinse afterwards.
1772 2018-11-08 20:21:43 My guess is both would be heading down following this trip, let's hope that is what occurs.
1773 2018-11-08 20:21:42 @Oil_Drop i muted you, just so you know. So i didn't even read your reply. I did this cause there is no point in us talking. 98% you write, i completely disagree with and i am sure the feeling is mutual on your end. So why even waste our time. Take care man
1774 2018-11-08 20:21:20 Oil straight down from $77 to $60 without even a relief rally @JoshManMode
1775 2018-11-08 20:21:18 If Trump's trade war with China was a mistake, then does calling a truce be a bigger one? I ask because China is committed to de-dollarization (SDR inclusion, oil-yuan-gold, rmb swaps, CIPS), and it wouldn't stop no matter what. So, is truce now a bigger strategic mistake?
1776 2018-11-08 20:21:15 And given the consumption of energy to get to the prices of these POWs, Oil and Nat Gas prices will be what? $600 a barrel and $200 per MMBtu? I hope not.

my friend who moved away from wa a couple years ago: what’s 1631? 

extremely depressing how little anyone outside the state even heard about it, and everyone inside the state was bombarded with big oil propaganda
1780 2018-11-08 20:20:58 I apparently didn't notice while I made use of the virgin oil.
I noticed the darken part while applying the others
1781 2018-11-08 20:20:51 That's different to the relaxing one I'd do - dimmed lights, candles burning, incense and lots of oil - you'd be asleep in no time. Make a hell of a mess of your bed though.

1791 2018-11-08 20:19:57 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

1804 2018-11-08 20:19:16 We're not saying NOBODY will oppose this, but that Native Texans grew up with Oil and Gas literally in their back yard. And many of them see a paycheck monthly/yearly from those entities. We're 100% against Fossil Fuels but Texas is a different animal entirely.
1805 2018-11-08 20:19:12 You can’t sell them pre mixed but it remains to be seen if they can sell a packet of cannabis oil and a coffee separately.

1812 2018-11-08 20:19:06 An absolute false statement. Without oil revenue how the country will be able to import medicine. US government said the same lies about Iraq, Libiya. This sanction will lead to a war and chaos and ultimately the normal citizens of Iran will pay the price of your policy.

1822 2018-11-08 20:18:14 you don’t need a college degree to get in the oil field, you don’t need a degree to get in sales, or electrician or any of those thing. All you need for those are hardwork and long hours but if people have enough to live in an apartment pay for food. People don’t want the work.
1823 2018-11-08 20:18:09 Oil is history soon anyway, so it will back to herding goats for the Saudis lol.
1824 2018-11-08 20:18:04 The criminal US regime must keep in mind that if they ever dare disturb Iranian boats,not Iranian oil tankers,the US Aircraft Carriers which are present in the region will never have a chance to see the US Dockyards again!

1837 2018-11-08 20:16:42 Funny how Oil was found and THEN we were allowed a loan from the IMF and they have been lending ever since. Go do the math and see where we actually are now on the debt front, we are even more sick than we were in 60s & 70s
1838 2018-11-08 20:16:40 However in the event of #IndyRef2, there will be no oil left in the North Sea

Thank the gods! Now she will run better. 

The car also had no oil yesterday (i had a feeling and went to autozone.

1844 2018-11-08 20:16:28 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...

1846 2018-11-08 20:16:13 In my agenda is to seperate oil from lemon
1847 2018-11-08 20:16:06 In oil for sure....But hard to see this market turning around any time soon without a proper production cut.
1848 2018-11-08 20:15:59 Walking and loads of it. Gravity will help baby engage . Did the castor oil and orange(not nice on the way out). Hot curry had similar effect. Pineapple you’d need to buy and eat the delmonte empire and sex well at this point it will be the last thing she will want  xx

1858 2018-11-08 20:15:18 My friend is a homeopathic facialist so if ever you just have skin stuff (acne, oil, milia, etc) she can/will definitely help ya out. A 90 min facial is like ~$120 and she not only gives you stuff to take home to use but helps you find products that work for your skin+budget
1859 2018-11-08 20:15:18 No but we may not have gone over £1tn in debt plus North Sea oil minus effective political control over MPs to remain where we are 

EU membership has been catastrophic whatever way you look at it. And if it did keep us 2nd in the world it still would be too high a price by miles

1864 2018-11-08 20:14:23 Lake Erie is a fucking depressing smog filled body of water with an inch thick level of oil on the entire surface. If that’s the inspiration, may as well fuckin burn them cause they’re losing every game they play in those shits
1865 2018-11-08 20:14:18 I can still recall that an exquisitely featured Italian ISTP oil heiress, confidently repositioning a demure yet glamorous calico kimono, strolling nonchalantly with a gigantic and glamorous mustang.
1866 2018-11-08 20:14:10 For calming/relaxation I'd recommend just CBD oil or CBD combined with lavender. Then it's not impairing on your mind and won't show up on a drug test.
1867 2018-11-08 20:14:06 Getting my oil changed and dude points out I have chords sticking out of my tire. No wonder it was driving so weird on my way home from Columbia

1870 2018-11-08 20:13:57 You are objecting to government controlled "Care"??? 

You want anybody who claims to be a doctor operate on you? You want "unlicensed" doctors, nurses, dentists running around? Snake oil salesmen? Untested drugs? 

That's ridiculous.

1872 2018-11-08 20:13:41 Coconut oil is ideal. 
I think other oil darkens
1873 2018-11-08 20:13:37 Anyone got any leads on any oil field companies looking for workers? I enjoy what I do now and make good money, but I wanna make money money!
1874 2018-11-08 20:13:27 Coconut oil can only darken you when you rub it and enter the sun. I think it’s advisable to use at night.
1875 2018-11-08 20:13:27 The guy at the farmers market who sells me oil and incense every week is in love with me, and always gives me free stuff. I like love. And free stuff.

1877 2018-11-08 20:13:20 But if I may ask why then would that same retailer stock up to keep the oil rather than sell and push volumes and make considerable profit pushing volumes?
1878 2018-11-08 20:13:15 22 is fossil. 25 is more like crude oil.
1879 2018-11-08 20:13:07 Coconut oil on a cotton ball wipe them soft with the cotton ball and they should start sliding off

1882 2018-11-08 20:12:56 Have you noticed Scheer cannot land a glove on Mr Happy Socks? 28% in Nanos? As long as he is seen as a fart catcher for big oil and fixated on small bore politics, he will get no traction.
1883 2018-11-08 20:12:54 Because of the gutter oil man. Too risky
1884 2018-11-08 20:12:53 When  and if you put your poppy on ( your choice) just stop and  have a think why those boys died.....just question it WHY ???

Sacrificed by the ruling classes ,dead in a trench to settle their power squabbles or dying in a desert for their oil supply.

1912 2018-11-08 20:10:00 Oil exploration in NZ means deep water drilling, and extraction costs are running at well over the selling price for any likely volumes. It’s a non paying proposition. FT estimes extraction at USD115 a barrel. Brent crude currently under USD80.
1913 2018-11-08 20:09:51 Ok, but let me ask: who benefits most from a rancorous, divided America? Russia doesn't as much as you might think; they have no economic expansion prospects. It's agriculture and oil for them. China, though? Both economic and military benefits to see a divided/declining USA.

1915 2018-11-08 20:09:29 Canada's rising dollar due to foreign demand for natural resources, with the Athabasca oil sands becoming increasingly dominant, hampered its manufacturing sector from the early 2000s until the oil price crash in late 2014/early 2015
1916 2018-11-08 20:09:27 I feel that working/doing improvement on large integrated petrochemicals site, over 6sq miles of plant, making *xylenes etc, & risk of explosion or toxic leak can kill 30,000, where processes are impacted by weather conditions & raw crude oil is variable grade is pretty complex..

1919 2018-11-08 20:09:03 I’ve worked in the oil industry all my life and they’ve been telling us there’s 20 years of oil left since 1983.
1920 2018-11-08 20:09:02 CBD oil didn’t heal my broken leg, who can I sue?
1921 2018-11-08 20:09:02 just like the oil industry will fight renewable power and electric cars, yeah. Would put a ton of people out of business, but it needs to be done. Adapt or die, not every business is forever.
1922 2018-11-08 20:08:46 damn CNBC saying oil could see $40's Eric Nutall is sitting in a corner somewhere in the fetus position shaking back and forth
1923 2018-11-08 20:08:44 The same clowns who nominated a condescending twit with investments in oil companies and sat at the Russian stooge table with “lock him up” Flynn at some Outin dinner.
1924 2018-11-08 20:08:41 So just stop using that app. That tv. That cellphone. That car and go back to your cave. We don’t have a taste for camel urine here. And oil we have plenty as well. The planet don’t need Saudi stupidness.even the name of your country will be changed soon.
1925 2018-11-08 20:08:34 Errands ahoy! Oil change, bank, tires if time, then back home to work on more stuff.
1926 2018-11-08 20:08:27 Why I'm probably single Reason # 1,811: I bought an oil diffuser yesterday and (# 1,812) then bought a little ornamental container to put it in because the diffuser itself looked too bland.
1927 2018-11-08 20:08:16 Conservatism is basically the belief that there is a massive conspiracy put forth by journalists, historians, doctors, scientists and teachers that can only be thwarted by a few plucky oil barons, corporate lobbyists and their billionaire allies.
1928 2018-11-08 20:07:59 I appreciate rotation days off. For things like having to get an oil change and start importing footage and edit can actually happen.
1929 2018-11-08 20:07:57 Just dropped 120 on a air filter and oil change, wtf I don’t wanna be an adult.
1930 2018-11-08 20:07:28 An oil rich country with about one third of eu waters, yes i suppose they wouldn`t want Scotland
1931 2018-11-08 20:07:28 BTW, I'm not arguing whether 500' is the correct setback or not. I don't know. But I do know that most people that actually live in Weld county (and other oil producing areas of CO) strongly opposed 112 bc they realize their local economy is strongly tied to O&G.

1935 2018-11-08 20:07:04 Even CBD oil?
1936 2018-11-08 20:07:03 Spare a thought for the million “oil in bear market” headlines that went out 20 minutes ago.
1937 2018-11-08 20:07:02 In 2014, the hostile #NewZealand government decided to open up to (1,200 sq mi) in the main habitat of the Māui's dolphin – for oil drilling. This amounts to one-quarter of the total sanctuary area In 2015, their population had declined to 43–47 w/only 10 mature females.

1945 2018-11-08 20:06:14 not to be dramatic but getting an oil change is my least favorite thing to do ever
1946 2018-11-08 20:06:13 Conservatism is basically the belief that there is a massive conspiracy put forth by journalists, historians, doctors, scientists and teachers that can only be thwarted by a few plucky oil barons, corporate lobbyists and their billionaire allies.
1947 2018-11-08 20:05:57 Your NEVER afraid to tell it like it is! True oilers fan never waver from the love of Oil Country. Much respect!
1948 2018-11-08 20:05:43 Unfortunately, at this time, capsules are more expensive than straight oil.

1952 2018-11-08 20:05:20 Buying oil from another source isn’t going to hurt Saudis, because they have the rest of the world to sell their oil to, Saudi Arabia is one of many oil producers and it can be replaced if this is the matter, but stability is hard to find, partner with Saudis is like partner ...
1953 2018-11-08 20:05:18 Also, little cub has her first case of the sniffles :c Thankfully the combo of saline spray, nose frida, natural baby chest rub, humidifier, breathe easy oil blend and Zarbees all seem to be helping! Not back to 100% yet, but at least she's able to sleep better.
1954 2018-11-08 20:05:08 Just cant bring yourselves to say it’s Scottish oil, can you?
1955 2018-11-08 20:05:05 Bring back set backs with fracking language in 2020. It was the most confusing Amendment to read. No one wants fracking in Colorado except for oil/gas industry. They sell our natural resources out of state and we get water that catches on fire and earthquakes. They get rich.
1956 2018-11-08 20:05:04 But also I have a shit ton of friends working in oil fields that are just trying to make a living and have job security and voted to make that possible. I disagree w what they do to my core but I get it- I drive a car cause I have to, I’m not innocent. Do you see what I mean?
1957 2018-11-08 20:05:03 If you read up on Cecil Rhodes in South Africa, King Leopold in Belgian Congo or the Royal Niger Company in Nigeria raising a private army to dominate the palm oil trade - it is easy to understand why Nigeria's first generation of intellectuals were socialists, not capitalists.
1958 2018-11-08 20:05:01 @DavidLenigas I'm sure you've got something up your sleeve regarding the weald .....ps do you think a rail link to the weald to transport the oil is feasible?? atb big Dave

1983 2018-11-08 20:02:25 Real question, how important is it that I get my oil changed ?? I’ve been holding it off for a month
1984 2018-11-08 20:02:19 Man, that sucks. I hate those places. It sounds like you're eating inside of an oil barrel, but louder. And picnic table seating? The best. I'm really selling this. But you should go. You have done amazing things in print and media and I'm sure that'll be appreciated.
1985 2018-11-08 20:02:10 @semccalljr 40. Why was it not illegal to sell snake oil?
1986 2018-11-08 20:02:07 As for coal and oil, they are reasonably clean, cheap, and our continued increase of our production insures our sovereignty. It finally frees us of the OPEC stranglehold we've been under for the last 3 decades. Factory Farms produce more harmful gas than modern power plants
1987 2018-11-08 20:02:05 Linoleic acid is in animal food, yes, but in low concentrated amounts.  An 8oz steak has a lot less than 1 tablespoon of seed oil

1990 2018-11-08 20:01:46 about 15-20% of myelin is PUFA. PUFA are also readily burned by muscle cells in aerobiosis. they are not toxic in themselves. now, having high intake of PUFA may be different story but for sure small amounts (normally should not eat more than 2-3oz of oil a day anyways).
1991 2018-11-08 20:01:44 All my US followers, please ask @POTUS to bring our troops and weapons home from the Middle East! We don't need their oil, and our brave troops are retuning home seriously wounded! Plz retweet!

1996 2018-11-08 20:00:59 Leaving food near an oil diffuser will result in said food tasting like the oil you're diffusing. That is a thing I know now.
1997 2018-11-08 20:00:54 Oh yeah windmills definitely do great up there! Solar is surprisingly viable too since there’s a plenty of clear skies. Locals are slowly starting to see the light peek through the coal ash, oil spills and methane leaks
1998 2018-11-08 20:00:40 I really need people to be more realistic with their estimated time frames. "He did the oil change but has to put oil in it." So you mean be drained the oil but changed nothing? Idiots.

2002 2018-11-08 20:00:23 Ceramic ones are better. Putting a serum or oil in your hair predrying goes a long way (but only a bit & focus on the ends) The type of brush you use can also make a difference like it also being ceramic. If it’s super bristly it’ll remove oil and dry your hair and make it liony
2003 2018-11-08 20:00:21 There is a history behind why Conservatives (in US and UK) support Saudis. After WW2, Churchill had carved out strategic alliances for "Western Civilization".

2116 2018-11-08 19:47:40 What’s the correlation between fixing foot bridges and guns . Misplaced priorities. No political leader has you in mind. Rice and oil for election and when they are in power the wouldn’t even give you gari. #fix madina-adenta road.
2117 2018-11-08 19:47:37 I'll have to try to find a way to post pictures of what I do.  I do polymer clay, oil pastels, coloring books with gel pens and scrapbooking.  I will be making my own Christmas cards.
2118 2018-11-08 19:47:27 you over stimulate skin w/ all that. It makes your oil glands overreact =breakouts. Stick to soap and water. Ivory or dial. Wash your face with your hands,don’t scrub unless taking off makeup. Change your pillow cases often. Zits?use clearsil. I’m 53. Been there. Trust me!
2119 2018-11-08 19:47:21 We demand Hannibal’s very public humiliation by various people: Jazzer, Nee’oil, Lexi & up to today I would have said Emmurr #thearchers
2120 2018-11-08 19:47:20 Attention Raider fans!

Due to the rescheduling of a Justin Timberlake concert, the Raiders' game in Edmonton on February 6 has moved.

The Raiders will now be in Edmonton to take on the Oil Kings on Monday, February 4.
2121 2018-11-08 19:47:15 You do know the market is flooded with virgin cold pressed coconut oil.
2122 2018-11-08 19:47:12 Sounds like a very interesting project just across the bay and very important too. Always got my eyes peeled for the Black Oil Beetle here in Gower!
2123 2018-11-08 19:47:08 When I get a house I’m gonna learn how to change my own oil lol
2124 2018-11-08 19:47:07 @joerogan what cbd oil/rub does ted nugent use?? I’m old and have sore muscles
2125 2018-11-08 19:46:57 i look like a greasy hog when I coconut oil soak in my hair ...
2126 2018-11-08 19:46:56 Yeahhh I know oil helps with anti-aging, but Lord all that oil was seriously clogging up my pores!  It was wayyy tew muchhh! Accutane is only prescribed for cystic acne (in case you didn’t know)! Not gonna be that easy to get your hands on if your skin is just oily
2127 2018-11-08 19:46:54 You have you run a little bit of coconut oil or any oil of your choice over it first to coat the skin
2128 2018-11-08 19:46:45 Far worse
2129 2018-11-08 19:46:37 Ro did not have margarine until 60's or so. by then the corn only diet was eradicated. warm pressed oil was available since late 1800s though.
2130 2018-11-08 19:46:31 Only
2131 2018-11-08 19:46:31 Oil & gas is exacting a heavy toll on the people of New Mexico: carbon emissions, air pollution, health problems, destruction of Native cultural and historical sites. We need to free ourselves from the O&G industry and transition to clean energy
2132 2018-11-08 19:46:26 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
2133 2018-11-08 19:46:21 The foolish virgins rushed to the village to buy oil. But while they were there, the bridegroom came.
2134 2018-11-08 19:46:21 A new report from the country’s chief statistician shows Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire had the heaviest loss of firms due to the continued effects of the oil and gas downturn.
Aberdeen City lost 210 businesses, meanwhile the number of firms in Aberdeenshire reduced by 140.
2135 2018-11-08 19:46:19 baked purple sweet potato drenched in olive oil + nooch. 
2136 2018-11-08 19:46:08 Oh My, does this translate to oil price wars and lowering the price of fuel? “would lead to a more volatile price environment and be negative for the global economy,” 
Would this hurt the US/global fracking industry?
2137 2018-11-08 19:46:02 #Brent  < $71 
#WTI.   < $61 
#crude #oil #opec #shale #oott
2138 2018-11-08 19:46:02 I’m going to get an oil change Monday.
2139 2018-11-08 19:45:54 Yes, but before you do put a little bit of coconut oil on first, it’s the same concept as putting grease around your hairline before getting a relaxer same concept it’s it works perfectly!
2140 2018-11-08 19:45:44 I really appreciate this new perspective and I have a lot of new points to consider. Maybe we can reach a compromise and continue with the Alberta oil sands as long as we can incorporate stronger protective policies and regulations.
2141 2018-11-08 19:45:26 Perhaps you can work on the technologies to transition from fossil to alternatives... The oil & gas industry knows the change is coming too! I'm sure wherever you end up working- all your hard work will be worth it.
2142 2018-11-08 19:45:18 US oil prices drop for a ninth consecutive session to 60.58 (-1.61%)
2143 2018-11-08 19:45:18 Sometimes it’s the small things that count!! Fill a gas tank up on Sunday for the week, get her oil changed every 3 months or 3000 miles.. Take the small things off her hands so she focus more..
2144 2018-11-08 19:45:08 so is canola oil and olive oil. put composition next to each other and differences are minimal. corn, soy, sunflower have more PUFA.
2145 2018-11-08 19:45:05 But that wouldn’t ruin their development.  #Oilers got to Oil.
2146 2018-11-08 19:45:05 And you can then repurpose the hot tub of oil to fend off hostile takeovers or those trying to take your tots.
2147 2018-11-08 19:45:05 CNBC reporting that OIL SUPPLY is UP because the USA is out producing the rest of the world!  

BUT...they warn...there’s a NEW THREAT. DEMS might want to END THE PROGRESS and revert to “OBAMA-STYLE” Oil Production.   

Code for “global warming” is BACK - STOP EVERYTHING
2148 2018-11-08 19:44:58 Add oil bunkering and other illegal businesses milking Nigeria to it, it's just that it's not in the books.
2149 2018-11-08 19:44:50 Another story missed as MSM was covering the election caravan.
Russia is benefiting nicely from oil sanctions on Iran. The Kremlin is playing both sides of the fence, exporting more to fill the Iranian gap, and importing from Iran for its domestic use.
2150 2018-11-08 19:44:48 The Alberta Oil Sands may not be the cleanest form of oil, but it is an industry that provides lots of jobs and economic benefit. The oil sands are also investing money in environmentally friendly initiatives. #money #benefits
2151 2018-11-08 19:44:46 "The phoniest and craziest things in the world cannot be fondled or even ingested - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
2152 2018-11-08 19:44:42 Dec. WTI oil loses $1, or 1.6%, to settle at $60.67/bbl
2153 2018-11-08 19:44:41 “The reality is that the Big Five oil sands producers have remained incredibly profitable corporations, which last year alone banked or paid out to shareholders $13.5 billion.”
2154 2018-11-08 19:44:23 you're welcome. At @ClimateHawkVote we targeted climate peacock Curbelo for his Big Oil ties. And we helped climate hawk @DebbieforFL win #FL26.
2155 2018-11-08 19:44:21 The environmental and health impacts of the Alberta tar sands outweigh the pros of the oil industry. It destroys critical habitats, pollutes our freshwater, and ruins the livelihood of Canada’s Indigenous peoples. We cannot let this continue. #stopthedegradation
2156 2018-11-08 19:44:09 Good luck to you Milan, I really hope it does do well.
2157 2018-11-08 19:44:03 WTI oil futures settle in bear market territory
2158 2018-11-08 19:43:50 Nice try
2159 2018-11-08 19:43:35 Maybe Alexa overheard the toaster gossip to the coffeemaker about how old the bottle of olive oil looks? Do you have any IoT @internetofshit devices by chance?
2160 2018-11-08 19:43:24 My aunt had open heart surgery. She wouldn't eat hardly anything. She lost over 50 lbs after surgery. She is 67, after a whole month of not eating I got her some CBD oil. Two drops in the morning and she started eating the second day. It was a gift from God.
2161 2018-11-08 19:43:23 I think you can too, but coconut oil is best for moisturizer
2162 2018-11-08 19:43:11 Snake oil. They want you to check out the latest greatest version of snake oil.
2163 2018-11-08 19:43:02 @JustinTrudeau can you please apologize for the lives and families you ruin and send into depression and poverty.  My family is directly affected from your arrogance towards the agriculture and oil and gas sectors. Shame! How about actually making a difference not taxing us more
2164 2018-11-08 19:43:01 Lol things happened which warranted me to step down.
2165 2018-11-08 19:42:48 Verb ghost oil!! It has literally changed my life. My hair has never felt better. And I have extremely curly , frizzy, coarse hair.
2166 2018-11-08 19:42:35 hot tub of oil, I'm a very busy business woman!
2167 2018-11-08 19:42:31 Mums putting oil in my hair and taking out the knots.
2168 2018-11-08 19:42:13 Синячил до двух часов ночи, подорвался на работу на сутки в шесть, приехал с перегаром и полумертвый. Бригадир предложил работу докера, сказал – идеально вольюсь.
2169 2018-11-08 19:42:10 Baked in the oven with love or thrown into a boiling mini hot tub of oil?
2170 2018-11-08 19:42:09 My parents used peppermint oil on tissues and stuffed em the doors to stay alert. Car used to be hella cool smelling
2171 2018-11-08 19:42:04 I po.o oil io9ohttps://oyoutu.be/hmcQ8UKBhbw – bij Interstate 95 & Boynton Beach Blvd

Supplements: Milk Thistle, Potassium Citrate, Magnesium.

1 glass of my standard Enhanced Water.

Almond Butter / Peanut Butter blend with Coconut Oil, Roasted Matcha Powder, Cinnamon and Nutmeg.
2173 2018-11-08 19:41:46 We have Canadian oil companies that don't care what the price is, they just invest somewhere else. That and they can still make their money through affiliates south of our border.
2174 2018-11-08 19:41:41 My bird didn’t faaaakin like it got engine oil all over her hair probably should have taken her tights off
2175 2018-11-08 19:41:41 CBD oil yes . THC no , the higher the THC ( 15% and higher) just makes you psychotic
2176 2018-11-08 19:41:31 Hi Miguel, we’re so sorry to hear this happened. Please contact our Instant Oil Customer Care team at 1-800-327-8242 or via email at customercare@valvoline.com. They can get more information and provide assistance.
2177 2018-11-08 19:41:26 Wow I imagaine having ptsd must be really hard ! and they probally gave you some strong medicine too. I have crohn and doctors wanted to give me medicine that would help my crohns but that fucked with everything else in my body now I use cbd oil wich works great for me
2178 2018-11-08 19:41:15 @PowerLunch @MelissaLeeCNBC @contessabrewer @JackieDeAngelis Lower #oil #wti prices for #Trump is a double edge sword, lower prices means less well paid oil sector jobs & he won't have such a nice payroll report
2179 2018-11-08 19:41:14 Wow, you both clearly have strong and conflicting opinions about this issue. If you could sum up how you feel about the oil sands in one tweet, what would it say? #elevatorpitch #oilsands
2180 2018-11-08 19:41:06 "#Oil is now in a bear market."

Wait...

"#OPEC is thinking about dissolving."

Like clockwork. #OOTT
2181 2018-11-08 19:41:06 i forgot how important my marula oil was for my foundation  i missed this bby
2182 2018-11-08 19:41:00 Actually, the amount of oil we get from Saudi Arabia that is only 10% of Canada’s oil imports (The Canadian Press, 2018). It can easily be covered by the US or another country.
2183 2018-11-08 19:40:54 @cnbc @JackieDeAngelis Re #CrudeOil I have to laugh at the Oil bulls of only 1 month ago, who were predicting (cheer-leading) for $100 bbl# WTI and $110 #Brent ... Oil Bulls are among the most delusional of all traders.
2184 2018-11-08 19:40:44 Wow, no oil and 10 years since the change - that is *massively* overdue ;-) 

(They'll surely sell you a car, to put the oil in, as well.)
2185 2018-11-08 19:40:35 Constitutional crisis? Like when @EricHolder swept the IRS scandal under the rug? Or, like when @HillaryClinton used the CIA and GCHQ to have Gaddafi offed for oil rights?
2186 2018-11-08 19:40:33 If you have pain, anxiety on any level, high stress, anything...you need cbd oil. That shit is a game changer.
2187 2018-11-08 19:40:30 OIL is falling down like a rock... the stock crash is close
2188 2018-11-08 19:40:30 They also have this burnt oil taste. I can only eat a couple
2189 2018-11-08 19:40:29 Lmao for yo ass they are  I like me feet to be rubbed down with oil 
2190 2018-11-08 19:40:28 チャーリーさん、どーしたんだろうな…
2191 2018-11-08 19:40:27 Some of the more out-there theories about where bunkered oil and gas ends up have cited Brazil.
2192 2018-11-08 19:40:24 i love low oil
2193 2018-11-08 19:40:22 The oil WILL run out. Fracking=what happens when readily avail ground crude no longer exists & need 2 push oil out of rock w/oil in it.
Even Mid East oil is hiring exploration geologists.
When the oil runs out, so will oil power. Maybe in lifetime of newly voting generation
2194 2018-11-08 19:40:19 the flowers, the cat, the owner... everything works itself around life like a beautiful oil painting
2195 2018-11-08 19:40:10 If oil stays that low ECB is doing a jig of glee .. Oil and Heating Oil/Gas was above 3% Inflation so with that out out of the way .. party on oh wait print on !!
2196 2018-11-08 19:40:09 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
2197 2018-11-08 19:40:09 Increasing our development of the oil sands will allow us to replace imports from Saudi Arabia, a country that Canada has weakening relationship with, which amount to around 75,000 barrels a day (The Canadian Press, 2018). #domesticisbetter
2198 2018-11-08 19:40:04 Amazing all the things happening just hours after the midterms especially in oil markets and geopolitics..
2199 2018-11-08 19:40:01 I have a 10-year-old. We actually rubbed him down with olive oil when we first got him, his coat was so bad (he's a rescue). But since then, yeah, he's silky smooth. And I give him a fish oil every morning. No snood, though.
2200 2018-11-08 19:39:58 Tax the real planet killers like palm oil palm sugar and soya
2201 2018-11-08 19:39:57 Yea I know the OIL rule. Who was your responsibility then because there was no one else to block. You got caught looking inside and Bruce blew past. No RB stops Bruce. My point is be humble cause reality is it wasnt a cakewalk and you guys didnt whoop anyones ass that day.
2202 2018-11-08 19:39:54 WTI oil is officially in a bear market, down 20%+ since the recent peak on October 3. Talk about boom-to-bust, #OOTT
2203 2018-11-08 19:39:51 Just some cabbage and a few other things in their little garden plots. Potatoes were the bulk of the diet, with milk, butter, maize meal, pork, maybe oats, barley, potcheen. Some people had only potatoes. Seed oil or a tomato would have been a strange site to bring stares.
2204 2018-11-08 19:39:36 Just got a spam email telling me my oil change is overdue. Since I haven't owned a car in more than 10 years, I'm left wondering what oil they're referring to.
2205 2018-11-08 19:39:02 To me the only good logos are ones that look like they'd make sense on a can of penetrating oil or a box of ball bearings.

This logo passes that test with flying colors.
2206 2018-11-08 19:39:00 Good morning Candice, We're sorry to hear you're MDX is having some issues with oil consumption. We recommend visiting your local Acura dealership if you have not already. They are able to perform a consumption test and to prescribe necessary corrective action. (1/2) ^WD
2207 2018-11-08 19:38:55 This is the result of the West plan for "NEW WORLD ORDER".
The result of Oil Money in the hands of criminals name themselves as #Saudi Kings.
Innocents children dying in #Yemen for the interest of Arm industries in the #UnitedStates & #UK.
Shame on #Humanrights organizations.
2208 2018-11-08 19:38:47 Just looking at fried food makes my stomach hurt  all that oil my God
2209 2018-11-08 19:38:33 The government of Alberta has in fact implemented heavy regulations on the use of water from the local rivers (Government of Alberta, 2018a) and 80-95% of water used in the oil sands are recycled to protect the environment (Government of Alberta, 2018c). #cleanwater
2210 2018-11-08 19:38:23 just coconut oil nd nothing else?
2211 2018-11-08 19:38:10 I’m also worried that the oil and other industrial run-offs might seep into our water supply, and hurt everyone and everything living in the area. Are my fears warranted?
2212 2018-11-08 19:38:07 I'm down after I get my oil changed baby
2213 2018-11-08 19:38:01 I hear the Croatians’ oil is a dreadful burden to them.
2214 2018-11-08 19:37:58 My mother and technology is like oil and water. It dont mix at well. She calls me at least 3 times a week about a problem. Mind you my little brother is living with her.
2215 2018-11-08 19:37:46 As members of the Consumer Goods Forum we have committed to achieve this by 2020. We have also committed to sourcing 100% certified palm oil (Tesco own-brand products) as a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. - Cam 2/2
2216 2018-11-08 19:37:38 The weight gain..

Magnolia oil from PEP
2217 2018-11-08 19:37:34 Sorry for the wrong info Emily. We had a bit of miscommunication on our end. I'm afraid none of our instore bread is palm oil free. However Tesco is committed to zero-net deforestation in our sourcing of palm oil. 1/2
2218 2018-11-08 19:37:31 I guess the animals aren’t benefiting from the oil sands, but sometimes we need to think about the people in Canada who’s lives will improve before we worry about how everything we do might affect a grasshopper! #makecanadagreatagain
2219 2018-11-08 19:37:28 Ted Cruz is a terrible human being no doubt, but you have to give him credit for protecting our economy particularly our oil/gas. He handled that aspect well that is why our state economy is so good.
2220 2018-11-08 19:37:27 Oil constitutes about 95% of Nigeria's general revenue.
2221 2018-11-08 19:37:22 But, really, floppy asparagus is pretty rough. Very simple to make a good, crispy asparagus. Drizzle olive oil and salt, bake 350 degrees for 12-15 minutes, and you're good to go
2222 2018-11-08 19:37:05 Hi, we’re sorry to hear you had to pay more than expected. Please contact our Instant Oil Customer Care team at 1-800-327-8242 or via email at customercare@valvoline.com. They can get more information and provide assistance.
2223 2018-11-08 19:36:57 avocado oil overlaps a great deal in composition with soy or sunflower oils. seed vs fruit difference does not have a real scientific basis. fruit is a vehicle for the seeds, their phitobiology is common. distinction is useful but not absolute good vs evil...
2224 2018-11-08 19:36:49 Sword swallowing champion. Penis shaped swords are his specialty.
2225 2018-11-08 19:36:48 I like that, but not with my steak. Too rich for me. Use a little butter, olive oil, garlic, oregano and a little seasoning. Black pepper for me rather than mustard. Would like your recipe with toast though. 
2226 2018-11-08 19:36:45 I’m so happy to hear that you care about our wildlife! Studies have shown that moose and caribou populations have been negatively impacted by the oil sands industry. These include raised levels of stress hormones and changes in resource selection. (Wasser et al., 2011).
2227 2018-11-08 19:36:44 We call it rapeseed oil in Ireland I never knew why it was canola oil on Canada!
2228 2018-11-08 19:36:39 Need to take it for an oil change lmao
2229 2018-11-08 19:36:39 Never use oil with egg... always butter.. fresher the eggs - no need for milk.. I hate that ‘ liquid egg’ taste that milk in egg gives so don’t use it
2230 2018-11-08 19:36:33 Oil ??
2231 2018-11-08 19:36:31 dxy/oil and bonds....  but hey go ahead and get lone stocks
2232 2018-11-08 19:36:22 No it's one in thousand and most find a job. Europe needs more people unlike Russia which relies on oil and gas. Lebanon doesn't need more people and has already "temporary" Palestinian refugees since decades. Il n'y a que le provisoire qui dure.
2233 2018-11-08 19:36:19 Sometimes I wonder how on earth people can deny climate change.  Then I remember that my dad literally keeps trying to convince me that by entering the oil & gas industry i'd be doing the globe a favour
2234 2018-11-08 19:36:15 “Instafamous snake oil salesman” Boy does this sum up those clipboard carrying tight “trainer” t-shirt wearing aholes  @DeFrancosGym
2235 2018-11-08 19:35:59 The "US State Department oil market" may be breaking down?
2236 2018-11-08 19:35:59 Sociopaths
2237 2018-11-08 19:35:58 I really care about animals, would the oil sands impact their lives and wellbeing? Canada’s wildlife is so important to our cultural identity. #canada #beaver #patriot
2238 2018-11-08 19:35:57 Any artists out there who are based in London, and are also proficient in oil painted portraits? Will pass along names tonight if you have a work example and contact deets or website
2239 2018-11-08 19:35:46 my old manager told me to put baby oil on WHILE in the shower  she obviously wanted me dead
2240 2018-11-08 19:35:44 and a candle? is that a candle next to the oil?
mxr is gonna be reviewing this in 3...2...
2241 2018-11-08 19:35:42 I think Nee’oil will be lenient.... at first. But Hannibal is the type to take a big lend; and then he’ll explode & there’ll be no going back. #thearchers
2242 2018-11-08 19:35:37 He did, no doubt
2243 2018-11-08 19:35:36 i made marcus buy my castor oil and when he got home he asked why i needed it so i told him and now im sitting in front of the door so he wont take it back to the store 
2244 2018-11-08 19:35:25 Nothing seem out of place when the 2 pictures are compared. Come to think of it, cows don't eat beans fresh, cooked or otherwise.
Let your man kontinu being livid
2245 2018-11-08 19:35:14 I have to disagree with Tiffany. I think the jobs created by the oil sands industry (over 100,000) are much more beneficial to the people in that area. (Government of Canada, 2018). #jobcreation #getthatbread
2246 2018-11-08 19:35:10 who wants to bet nobody on tumblr will have the same anti-vanity energy now that charity’s asking if she can oil men up and acting like she’s a single woman that they did when they were demonising vanessa for one mistake she made several months prior
2247 2018-11-08 19:35:09 Well we export oil, our local stuff is high grade used for making plastics. We import cheaper oil to then make into fuels. From memory we profit from this arrangement
2248 2018-11-08 19:35:08 Okay so my engine light came on, i need two front tires cause they are bald, an alignment, oil change, a new job cause outriggers is being torn down due to the state of fucking Texas, and my radio in my car is acting up. Go life.
2249 2018-11-08 19:35:07 Yes, the blossoms make Neroli Essential oil.

2253 2018-11-08 19:34:54 The oil industry is especially harmful to Alberta’s Indigenous peoples who rely on the area for hunting, fishing, and clean water. The oil sands have been considered an industrial genocide for these groups (Huseman and Short, 2012).
2254 2018-11-08 19:34:45 I ordered a Manhattan last night and it was awful, oily, and had like a hunk of orange in it. Instead of just saying “hey this isn’t nice can you remake it without orange?” like an adult I said I’m allergic to orange oil and that I’m so sorry for being a hassle.
2255 2018-11-08 19:34:42 Crude oil down 21% since the Oct high. That’s a bear marker folks. But all is well according to the Fed.
2256 2018-11-08 19:34:40 I know I can’t be the only one that hates getting an oil change.
2257 2018-11-08 19:34:40 WW1 Tommies died for oil, power, influence and land grab, not for our freedom as successive governments and others like to sell it. People don't like to hear that but rudimentary research confirms it as a fact. Service personnel used and abused? You bet.
2258 2018-11-08 19:34:35 Addiction #Recovery not a political football. Human Spirit was here before Constitution written. And long before oil&gas. But we’re addicted to lifestyle only fossil fuels can prop up now. Helplessness is what we’re fighting against. Better if we join our efforts.

2265 2018-11-08 19:33:35 Wow, this sounds like a really complicated issue! How do you think the impact on the environment would affect the people living in the oil sands region?

2270 2018-11-08 19:33:14 SENIOR Gulf OPEC source is suddenly worried about his retirement plan. A world without OPEC is unthinkable. Who would give the top-secret off-the-record briefings essential for guiding the oil market?!
2271 2018-11-08 19:33:12 We can’t forget the value of the ecosystem services that the oil sands region provides for us, including air purification, water filtration, carbon accumulation and erosion control (Salles, 2011). By destroying the environment, we lose invaluable services.

anyways diet is a poorly researched area and we go mostly by tradition, cyclical fads and naked advertising by food producers...

2278 2018-11-08 19:32:40 Sir, lagta hai ki hamare PM @narendramodi sahi me lucky hai. State election se just pahle Crude oil price drasticly gir raha hai. Now Brent @$70-71. All the best.
2279 2018-11-08 19:32:35 Someone please explain to me how we can show respect Native Americans and at the same time run a big oil pipe through their drinking water.
2280 2018-11-08 19:32:30 Mmm nope.  Still vast amounts of oil under ground.  Your carcass will likely become oil before it runs out.
2281 2018-11-08 19:32:29 palm oil is a fruit oil. It's high in saturated and mono-unsaturated fat.  Fats from fruit oils (avocado, olive, palm, coconut) are great.
2282 2018-11-08 19:32:28 And here I was thinking it was revenge for creating systemd :)
You're probably not far off the mark. Feeling the pressure of becoming irrelevant, IBM bought a small speedboat and are now tying it to their oil tanker in the hope that it'll shift course.
2283 2018-11-08 19:32:26 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
2284 2018-11-08 19:32:23 That's a starch clump! Not pretty, but harmless. Starch clumps are a result of the sugars in the potatoes being released during the frying process. These starches collect in the oil, stick together & form clumps. We inspect for these but missed this one. Sorry!
2285 2018-11-08 19:32:17 Oil looks like its gonna crash here.
2286 2018-11-08 19:32:02 do u have jojoba oil?? bc if not i def recommend getting that once u start stretching again, i recently tore one of lobes and had to drop two sizes but having the oil really helped spread up the healing and made my ears workable again
2287 2018-11-08 19:31:36 "Stay in your lane"?  Oh, please.  Doctors are pro-life & the NRA, like so many poison-producing industries (oil, coal, etc.), will always choose making a buck over the deaths they create with their products.  The other fact is that the GOP will always support them over us.  Ugh.
2288 2018-11-08 19:31:36 Guys: in a relationship / marriage, so you feel your gf/wife is responsible for her oil changes or is that something you keep up & take care of for her?
2289 2018-11-08 19:31:28 Nice one
2290 2018-11-08 19:31:22 I should of cleaned out my car a bit before coming to get my oil changed

2294 2018-11-08 19:31:08 My Irish grandparents never saw seed oil of any sort or even a tomato until they came to the states.
2295 2018-11-08 19:31:03 Hey @realDonaldTrump Now u got Saudi's putting out crap about a breakup of OPEC??? OK you may think its a good think BUT what the hell would another price war do to OUR oil complex. Remember 2014?? Call @HaroldHamm and ask him!
Cheap oil is NOT good oil
@SecretaryRoss @SecPompeo
2296 2018-11-08 19:30:42 You’re right that the oil sands would be really good for the economy. In fact Alberta’s upstream energy sector, which includes the oil sands, was equal to $28.3 b in 2016 and is estimated to be $23.7 b for this year (Government of Alberta, 2018c)
2297 2018-11-08 19:30:41 Wow!!

2303 2018-11-08 19:30:21 This is about the dumbest reply. First, it definitely *can* work, as it did for me. Second, there are zero products or wonder cures to it, so I’m not sure how “limit carbs and sugar” can be labeled snake oil unless you fundamentally don’t understand what snake oil is. Lol
2304 2018-11-08 19:30:06 Politics and religion mix as well as oil and water.
2305 2018-11-08 19:30:05 Except for Africa, where peoples in many areas could make palm oil without too much trouble, apparently.

2307 2018-11-08 19:30:03 I just read an article on from Rob Soria @Oil_Drop and it is absolutely disgusting. Relentless whining about Chiarelli and his views on his moves. Seriously enough is enough already for fuck sakes!

2310 2018-11-08 19:29:53 Just think ,in an Indy Scotland with all that oil ,all ours,that we leave where it is ‘cos we don’t need it ‘cos of our renewables..,just think of the angst that will cause in the F.U.K. 
2311 2018-11-08 19:29:51 Hargrump is just one of those church of vegans who would rather plow down animals to grow soy, avocados, and palm oil then pretend his food is cruelty free.
2312 2018-11-08 19:29:43 They just be overdependent on the oil causing lots of deaths and crisis in Niger delta.
Let's just really focus on Agriculture.
2313 2018-11-08 19:29:25 You do oil painting? Do you have any tips? I was just about to try and paint something for the first time to see how it goes but I'm a bit nervous I'll mess up eve if it's not a serious project
2314 2018-11-08 19:29:25 whats an oil fryer?
2315 2018-11-08 19:29:16 Is there a swb version? I don’t really want the 6 wheeler (must’ve been going for that market even pre-1973/4 oil shock!?)
2316 2018-11-08 19:29:06 Yes I always plan for an oil change too because  every little thing counts in the end!! Thank you so much. Very excited to stuff my face 
2317 2018-11-08 19:29:03 I just dropped my truck off at Jiffy Lube to get an oil change and the mechanic asked if I’d been mud-sliding
2318 2018-11-08 19:28:52 But this is a more like give or take situation, somebody like a masseuse should just stick to rubbing oil on muscles and not get into higher level mind games with someone especially like Jose.
2319 2018-11-08 19:28:46 they did use seed oils since middle ages. sesame oil, sunflower oil.  Amerindians used sunflower - they made an oily paste they cooked other veggies in.
2320 2018-11-08 19:28:45 Sell bonds, stocks, oil, gold. Buy dolla ... Hmmm.

2323 2018-11-08 19:28:28 What if @sonicdrivein changed your oil AND delivered you cheeseburgers. Please send royalty checks. Thanks.
2324 2018-11-08 19:28:19 Its only Africans who buy anointing oil for protection from a pastor who has 6 bodyguards.

2326 2018-11-08 19:27:59 I'd really like to serve Scott Conant a raw red onion and truffle oil sandwich.
2327 2018-11-08 19:27:56 The cost of Heat and electric have gone way up. We are still producing  plenty of OIL and GAS. With tax breaks, energy goes up in price to the consumer. Deregulation causes Cancer.
2328 2018-11-08 19:27:54 Mtshew! If a man should toast me like this , I will pour hot oil on his face .

2331 2018-11-08 19:27:48 Hilariously - the US' president in his bid for Nationalism would destroy our economy. Most of the world's oil is traded in Intl banks using USD. Those transactions are central to our economic strength. Moving to EU proposals had the US throw a coup in Venezuela and attack Iraq.

2334 2018-11-08 19:27:19 Coconut Oil Would Be Fine ... Just Make Sure It’s Organic
2335 2018-11-08 19:27:10 Some recommend face moisturizers:
-garnier skin active soothing 3in1 moisturizer. (also a mask bc I’m all abt dual purpose products)
-moonlit skincare midnight shift overnight facial oil

2336 2018-11-08 19:27:00 One of my coworkers gave me an oil diffuser, I fucking love it 
2337 2018-11-08 19:26:55 He is, but he doesn't stand a chance with the current Dem primary base (white, male, extremely moderate, pro oil and gas). I think he knows that and is trying to keep his name in local headlines until then.
2338 2018-11-08 19:26:50 “People say data is the new oil, but there is a refiner needed”
2339 2018-11-08 19:26:49 Hi Heid, thanks for this. I will look at the video...I bought a small line this afternoon on the back of the fall and will look to top up more at lower levels......picked up some OBT yesterday and this afternoon.....directors buying heavily and selling drying up -
2340 2018-11-08 19:26:12 #Erdogan has a long history of using #ISIS as a proxy force for his expansionist objectives. And his son Bilal sure does like ISIS oil. #twitterkurds
2341 2018-11-08 19:26:10 Instead of daily cleansers, I switch to moisturizers and always make sure to wash my face with oil free wash before bed. In the shower usually. The problem MIGHT be that you're over processing your face and that can cause your pores to over compensate with oil.
2342 2018-11-08 19:25:27 BEEB nowadays welcomes all sorts of snake oil salesmen.
2343 2018-11-08 19:25:22 linoleic (and linolenic) acid is in veggie oil too ( all linoleic is conjugated)... lots of it. the lipid absorbtion and metabolism is very complex.
2344 2018-11-08 19:25:21 We’re working on it. Oil and natural gas is big here and doesn’t like the competition, but our senators and OUR NEW CONGRESSWOMEN AND GOVERNOR are big fans.
2345 2018-11-08 19:25:10 Alright!
2346 2018-11-08 19:24:58 Remind me not to use PanOxyl as a cleanser when my PMS has already dried my skin out. My face legit feels 10 times dryer than it normally does when it’s “that time”. I wish I could slather fucking baby oil all over my face, it feels that dry (not that I ever actually do that).
2347 2018-11-08 19:24:58 I watched a guy change out a IPC, oil O-ring, IPR, IPR(pig tail), and the truck still wouldn’t start. I came over and purged the air out of the fuel and the truck started right up.

2351 2018-11-08 19:24:15 I started using one of those pill stackers for my vitamins & fish oil, so I'd hide my prescriptions in with my vitamins which look like horse pills. IDK why, but it feels more socially acceptable to be seen wolfing down supplements than opening an orange prescription bottle.
2352 2018-11-08 19:24:04 Oil price will fall for the next seven years.

2357 2018-11-08 19:23:16 China's economic slowdown means weaker commodity imports - which means weaker economic growth for African commodity producers.

It also means lower oil prices - which will have an impact on Nigeria.
2358 2018-11-08 19:23:15 I wanna make my own body oil fragrance....
2359 2018-11-08 19:23:14 Let me explain again. It's the undertone of the statement; if I refer in a derogatory manner to garri frying, spare parts trading and palm oil producing people, that would be tribalistic; subtly aimed at those from the SE/SS. That's how, and such statements benefits no one.
2360 2018-11-08 19:23:03 Your inlaw gave me palm oil to give you... but it's late now... hope tomorrow will be convenient

2374 2018-11-08 19:21:30 I'll tell you right now the one put forward in Washington was voted down because it was written incredibly vaguely, with no requirement to lower emissions, exemted taxing exporters of oil, and gave no indication who would be responsible for handling the plan.

2384 2018-11-08 19:20:15 My favorite part of being a woman is when you tell the auto guy your car is out of oil and you need to buy some and he doesn’t believe you could’ve possibly checked it correctly yourself so he rechecks it 

and comes to the same conclusion

2402 2018-11-08 19:18:43 The report is part of a wider rethinking among senior government officials in Saudi Arabia about OPEC, according to the people familiar with the matter. Officials are grappling with the assumption—shared increasingly in the oil industry—that oil demand will one day peak.
2403 2018-11-08 19:18:40 Seems like not long ago we were talking about peak oil, now it's peak oil demand.
I think both are a long way off.

2506 2018-11-08 19:08:36 Correct.  Once upon a time, McDonald's used to cook their fries in beef tallow then due to the 'heart healthy vegetable oil" craze they switched over to vegetable oils.  Big mistake.

2522 2018-11-08 19:06:57 @MrRickyWhittle Brilliant! Better bump up the hair-makeup budget. Quality beard oil ain't cheap.
2523 2018-11-08 19:06:47 PTSD is a serious thing many people have to live with. THC/CBD oil could really help veterans who are fighting with this. We need to do better for our veterans
2524 2018-11-08 19:06:47 U re welcome, bro, I can never insult a person like you. Only those that decide to be stupid that I gets that type of treatmt frm me.
2525 2018-11-08 19:06:41 He is on the Board of Rosneft, the Russian oil company.   You should preface his quote with "Russian operative says..." so his political slant is clear.

2528 2018-11-08 19:06:35 I put Parmesan cheese on top before closing it with the second batch of puff pastry but you don't really have to. Once you have put the second batch on top, beat an egg and oil together and brush it on the puff pastry. Put it in the oven again until golden brown
2529 2018-11-08 19:06:34 I wonder
2530 2018-11-08 19:06:30 Yeah it's a basic check-up and change of oil and what not as I've understood it. Supposedly they also do work there, but how well they do it is anyone's guess
2531 2018-11-08 19:06:14 #DiabloswitchI I would play it at work on an oil rig

2533 2018-11-08 19:06:00 i just tried oil pulling for the first time and i had no idea what it was so i ordered a the @KopariBeauty pack from sephora and i’m here to say my dumbass literally spent $30 for a tube of overpriced pina colada flavoured coconut oil
2534 2018-11-08 19:05:48 I will not, in the tradition of Swedish humor, be making a Norwegian Joke about their recent crashing a military frigate into an oil tanker.
2535 2018-11-08 19:05:44 I call it cooking if the oil burns one of my three chest hairs...

So there is that...
2536 2018-11-08 19:05:15 A new set of oil and gas sector vacancies coming next week...contract and permanent. Watch this space

2546 2018-11-08 19:04:44 Take away their oil, what else do they have? Bigotry, misogyny, nepotism, suppression and oh! Religion.
2547 2018-11-08 19:04:41 i just paid $50 towards my credit card bill and then immediately spent $25 on the credit card to get oil and antifreeze for my car because i don’t have enough money in my checking to buy that and get gas for the week 
2548 2018-11-08 19:04:37 Yep.
Enough money to wipe the entire UK public debt and leave something for rainy days.
Because Norway, that has access to the same North Sea Oil basins, is in that financial position.
No public debt, £Tn away in an oil fund and £Bn profits to spend every year.

2556 2018-11-08 19:03:47 Ok, I love cheddars, but I don’t love palm oil and I have only just noticed it’s an ingredient. I won’t buy more until it’s removed.
2557 2018-11-08 19:03:46 Na T you ain’t spend 200 just on oil right?
2558 2018-11-08 19:03:44 Called the @thekiastore twice yesterday and twice today about INCORRECT AND INCOMPLETE SERVICE.

2563 2018-11-08 19:03:29 Turkey needs to undertstand that its role in Syria has not been constructive Erdogan is looking to expand into Syria territory and replace the SDF with his turkish FSA fighters east of the euphrates for the control of oil wells & supply lines to the Iraqi border
2564 2018-11-08 19:03:22 No problem, thanks for the help. I'll just have to keep an eye on my oil level.

2569 2018-11-08 19:02:57 Because England has no oil and Scotland will soon be independent. Oddly, they seem intent on ruining what little water they have left too.
2570 2018-11-08 19:02:44 Used to joke in high school the cause of a fight between Kera and Nefas Silk youngsters is the ownership of the then Shell now Ethio Libya oil company. Sometimes I think we are just looking for a reason

2574 2018-11-08 19:02:06 Thanks. The rocker cover was leaking but I have fixed it as far as I know. The oil sump seems a bit wet but can't determine the cause...
2575 2018-11-08 19:01:57 economic demise are result of.. dictatorship? Try removing your sanctions, let the oil flow..don't think ther'll be problems.

2582 2018-11-08 19:01:13 My once liberal now conservative father says that too. It’s odd to me as he’s always been middle to lower middle class (and at one point we were 10 steps from damn near being homeless). Now he goes to bat for big oil and the NRA. Like what did they ever do for you?!
2583 2018-11-08 19:01:04 My cousin uses a beard oil and conditioner so there’s no itching, if that helps any. Grey just makes it more distinguished so don’t worry about that. It’s great your raising money for Special Olympics!
2584 2018-11-08 19:01:02 sugar, seed oil...If I had to choose one to give up I think it would be seed oil.
2585 2018-11-08 19:00:59 Please next you will accuse others of having crystal balls and hidden oil wells. It’s our oil engineers who are world leaders and managing to get extra life out of oil. Nothing to with indi. You are crackers.
2586 2018-11-08 19:00:58 I'm a medical Marijuana user & I can speak from experience putting CBD oil in hair products doesn't do anything at all generally CBD oils are used to treat specific  conditions all that will happen is her fans outside the usa won't be able to purchase & ship the products

2606 2018-11-08 18:59:56 YEEES! This oil is great for so many things. Is your aunt a Wellness Advocate? Or just she just use the oils? We are putting together classes in the concord area, so if you guys are ever interested in coming, you are both more than welcome!! 
2607 2018-11-08 18:59:53 nah i baked it. it would probably be better if i did it in the pan with some olive oil but baking is supposed to be the healthiest

2609 2018-11-08 18:59:50 Absolutely, macro indicators improve drastically with oil price reduction, we can already witness rupee appreciation in the last couple of weeks and should continue further.Also helps a lot in containing current account deficit.
2610 2018-11-08 18:59:48 I HATE qettinq my Oil done 
2611 2018-11-08 18:59:46 I KNOW....... they say for dry and ruined hair (mine, sadly) oil should be replaced with amino acids and then give a List of Masks You Can Use TM so its very hmmmmm. i am considering... listening to my grandma. and putting an Egg on my head.

2613 2018-11-08 18:59:37 I haven't come across any evidence of Irish people using any dietary oils, just flaxseed meal, which was a gruel. For fat they used butter, lard and tallow, like all pastoral peoples. My Irish grandparents had never even seen seed oil until they came to "the States."
2614 2018-11-08 18:59:26 And the Trust now in special measures ... unsurprisingly. 
dept of Health worried about "accident & emergency"....keep going guys! 
Squeaky wheel gets the oil! Or in this case the attention of Gov. Lord knows it's difficult enough.
2615 2018-11-08 18:59:25 Its funny that ! It's the same analogy they use with Andy Murray. When he's winning he's British but when he's losing he's Scottish. With Oil, when it's running out Its Scottish Oil when it's a proven future resource it's UK oil. Makes you think there's some kind of agenda

2619 2018-11-08 18:59:04 Interesting.  Statoil changes to Equinor as an attempt to shift their image into a "broader" energy company and invests in 3 new offshore projects off the east coast. Dirty Canadian oil indeed. *wanking motion*

Put another way, I don't think the oil tanker (w/ tug) would have ploughed into the frigate early this morning if the frigate had AIS on. That doesn't mean AIS was at fault, or the "cause", or even related, but the tug and tanker didn't know it was there.

2643 2018-11-08 18:56:52 It really isn't too fancy. Just some oil that you use to keep your beard soft. A friend got me hooked on it, and now I have gotten several others hooked. It really does make a huge difference for very little effort.

2666 2018-11-08 18:54:12 The best use of oil & gas is C storage underground. We need to wean ourselves off fossil fuels asap. This straw man propaganda isn’t going to change many minds. You will have to find another way to make a living. How about solar energy installations?

2670 2018-11-08 18:53:27 Just want to note that @bathbodyworks has some incredible customer service. We received a shipment from them and the oil from the wallflower leaked on everything. Not only are they sending replacements but they are overnighting it. Maybe @comcast should take some notes from them
2671 2018-11-08 18:53:25 Okay
So before you start making your lamb curry, let your puff pastry defrost by leaving it in a sunny area. 

Lamb Curry:
Put a bit of olive oil in the pan and let that heat up. Whilst it is heating up chop onions and garlic then put them in the pan once the oil has heated

2677 2018-11-08 18:53:07 Output and employment are sure to increase as a result of trade friction. Likewise, I find my car works better without oil. You should try it.
2678 2018-11-08 18:52:55 Really that’s interesting you could be stressed ... you can try all these 
1.) Workout 
2.) No caffeine or Alcohol
3.) no tv or phone 1 hour before bedtime
4.) Melatonin 
5.) light Lavender essential oil on mattress.
6.) Make sure your Zinc supplements. I take ZMA
2679 2018-11-08 18:52:54 true and

2682 2018-11-08 18:52:40 He doesn't know. The SNP have told him that we are cheated out of revenue from oil and whisky. They tell lies and he is gullible enough to believe them.
2683 2018-11-08 18:52:37 as cobalt become the new oil.....we should have agreements such as the one which prevent BLOOD DIAMOND to come into the market place
2684 2018-11-08 18:52:36 No body should ever wish to date any one addicted to sex. Talk more of getting married to the person. #speakingfromexperience the person will destroy all the oil and life in you. And the person will cheat when you can no longer hit that peak anymore. MUST

Why is that so?
2688 2018-11-08 18:51:53 WM decides to give Scotland billions more than Scots can generate in revenue. We benefit from the union. Your kids etc. would be reduced to a much lower standard of living if you got your separate Scotland. Oil? How much does that bring in? Whisky? Who owns it? Mainly foreigners.

2691 2018-11-08 18:51:44 I'm not very bright but when I hear enough people demonize one group, I have to figure out what's really going on and why.  Usually it is about $, natural resources=$, land=$.  This has an added bonus of  Brown vs White ppl & God.  Where else is that playing out?!? w/oil no less.
2692 2018-11-08 18:51:44 Four INTERNATIONAL oil agreements, dating from 1928 to 1934 and the oil industry's activities to IMPLEMENT these agreements through local cartels and in other ways from the basic charter of the petroleum cartel.
2693 2018-11-08 18:51:25 Drivers spent an extra £40 million on fuel in October compared to September. Oil prices have dropped 11% since the beginning of October, but it has taken some retailers until the 8th Nov to pass those savings on to the customer. Oil has fallen from $84.73 to $75.55 in 6 weeks.
2694 2018-11-08 18:51:19 Oil is a commodity that expands and contracts in direct and contrary relation to polls on #scotref .
2695 2018-11-08 18:51:02 The EEC was a very different animal to the EU; it's like comparing a tug boat with an oil tanker.
2696 2018-11-08 18:50:59 I just ordered a large bottle of peppermint-flavored CBD Oil, and I am anticipating chugging it like Liquid Candy. At first I might get a tummy ache, but then my body will fully heal itself like brand new.

2701 2018-11-08 18:49:58 @LandersFordMphs thanks for the free oil change. I was told it would take 30-40 minutes, it took longer. When I went to check out I was told it was free because it took so long. That’s why I keep coming back. #greatcustomerservice
2702 2018-11-08 18:49:56 My friend has a beard line, check it out @CCLBeardButter but he does oil as well
2703 2018-11-08 18:49:51 Texas used to be a place of cowboys, Mexicans, Indians, oil men, big personalities and not caring what you think about it. 
Texas is going the way of the cuck. I’m scared Florida is gonna steal our girlfriends now.
2704 2018-11-08 18:49:36 @todd_harrison Todd have you heard of CBDistillery? My nephew has severe anxiety and gets really bad tinnitus from SSRIs. He has been using oil from them and says it helps a lot. He uses an isolate because they drug test at his work.
2705 2018-11-08 18:49:29 I'm sure you're right, and training, funding, etc.. is fundamentally at fault, but AIS would have helped. The tug taking the oil tanker out didn't even see them.

2709 2018-11-08 18:49:14 @ForteOilNg I bought fuel of 10000 at forte oil bajulaiye In somolu and they dispense 9992.then I ask why and the pump girl told me that their engineer programmed it like that,that its an order from the manager.

2715 2018-11-08 18:48:41 Some of the oil based seeds or fruit are mustard sesame groundnut almond coconut and these are the traditional cooking oil in indian kitchen. MNC s introduced oils based on non oil seeds like soyabean ricebran sunflower.

2722 2018-11-08 18:48:17 Putting palm oil or groundnut oil in a table water bottle, like EVA, Aquafina and the rest is the best because it add some flavor to it.

2730 2018-11-08 18:47:28 MLPs & C Corp pipeline companies are acting great today, even in the face of a falling oil price. The question is; can this sector now finally decouple from the oil price, as it should and finally come into favor as an asset class?

2926 2018-11-08 18:26:38 Tbh that shit makes me wanna change my oil 
2927 2018-11-08 18:26:34 Ontario Teachers Pension also investing elsewhere, including the US oil industry. Even the large Canadian pension funds realize that Canada is an increasingly poor place to invest.
2928 2018-11-08 18:26:32 This womens march is run by a rabid Muslim anti semite, sharia law advocate and a racist. Tamika Mallory is a racist. Dems haven't denounced this. In fact they just elected a Palestinian rep and another muslim anti semite to Congress in MN. CBC applauds this.
2929 2018-11-08 18:26:24 They don't, it's the same fatty foods cooked in exceptional amounts of oil. You'd also be surprised at how small the number of people in other countries who cook.
2930 2018-11-08 18:26:06 For oil. Your unwarranted negativity based solely on price movement is a positive indicator.

2932 2018-11-08 18:26:02 Do you use oil/butter for your steaks? Which one? 
2933 2018-11-08 18:25:57 The ban on whaling and those lamps still need some sort of oil.....
2934 2018-11-08 18:25:51 Shea butter, vitamin e oil, bio oil everyday! Maybe twice a day
2935 2018-11-08 18:25:46 What exactly should Trudeau do. The government of canada doesn't buy oil we're not communist here. If albertans want us to use their oil then build a pipeline to Ontario and stop shutting down refineries
2936 2018-11-08 18:25:35 #Crude Oil WTI

If sustain below 60 can touch 55.55, pullback max 64-65.

Trend: Rangebound to Negative.
Trend will change only able 65 WCB.
2937 2018-11-08 18:25:30 Mrs. Bonadies’s students are working on  The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe art pieces. They are painting with oil pastels  and the results are amazing!
2938 2018-11-08 18:25:29 I’m wearing my essential oil diffuser necklace for the first time today!  It’s cute and I like the idea of having a nice, calming oil around my neck at all times
2939 2018-11-08 18:25:26 They said they dropped motor oil into my air filters so that’s why my ac is blowing the smell into my car. So they’re gonna keep my car to clean it. But they didn’t tell me why my engine sounds loud af after my oil change. Someone fucked up.
2940 2018-11-08 18:25:25 Oil will be gone someday and we will be no better off if we drag our feet at a solution.
There's always a cost to change.
Think about it.
If we didn't welcome changes, we would still be riding horses.
2941 2018-11-08 18:25:20 Which time? The eradication of the indigenous people? The wars for oil? The joining of the UN? NAFTA? Or were you thinking of other examples?

2943 2018-11-08 18:25:12 It seems our allies are worse than our enemies! But they got the oil
2944 2018-11-08 18:25:07 Which is more than what my late hubby did, he use to burn everything, set the fire alarm off 4 times in 20 mins by having the oil too hot then burnt the Christmas dinner, only thing he could do was meals in the halogen oven we had
2945 2018-11-08 18:24:59 I bought Oil stocks here Down hard  $COP $BP 41.40  &  $MRO while $XOM not down ?

2947 2018-11-08 18:24:42 I am serious.. I do not get the sense of humor... Plus all I did is warn that this oil is trending lower for the short term...
2948 2018-11-08 18:24:39 @megreenwell What was the Oklahoma book you recommended on the Deadcast? The Google search only turned up 8th grade text books that I assume attribute Oklahoma's oil to Jesus' tears.
2949 2018-11-08 18:24:37 Also the studies on children were on sick kids in hospitals basically living on mct oil shakes and mayonnaise. Not meat.  Not human nutrition. I’m not surprised they had health problems
2950 2018-11-08 18:24:27 Lmmfao soo I’m at the dealership to get an oil change and I hop out and go sit inside... the dude came in and was like “ma’am do you have your keys?” 

And I was so shame bc I had put my key fob in my titties and had to reach in there and get it lmaooo it was warm asl

2954 2018-11-08 18:24:04 Yea WSJ says, exemptions for China etal on Iran oil + domestic production = glut
2955 2018-11-08 18:24:02 Just got in an Uber and my Uber driver asked me where I worked and proceeded to go on a 15 minute rant about oil companies and how I work for corrupt people and I should check my morals. Damn bro I just do the finance. And you wouldn’t have a car or cellphone without oil so gtfo
2956 2018-11-08 18:23:58 Also... Iran is sitting on top of billions of gallons of Oil... The same Oil BP tried to steal from them and then hired the CIA to over throw the rightfully elected president to install a puppet... Now we have the current regime...
2957 2018-11-08 18:23:57 Randrluxury black soap and oil for the win.
2958 2018-11-08 18:23:56 Carol, use baby oil to make sure the rest of the adhesive is off your skin, then if u have hydrocortisone cream, that will calm the rash down a lot. Hope that helps a little.
2959 2018-11-08 18:23:53 I’m not sure why Andy left his wife and andineyi nazvo. Nhai cooking oil ikutengeswa kupi

2960 2018-11-08 18:23:52 #StressAwarenessDay  I like to soak in hot bath with salts & bath oil. Candles lit with soft music. Depending on my mood maybe a glass of wine. I like to read in the tub as well but I am clumsy & always end up getting my book wet.
2961 2018-11-08 18:23:50 Can't wait to see 007 again
2962 2018-11-08 18:23:48 That pipeline is indefinitely delayed. Train transport will be the way some of the oil gets out of AB. Kenney is full of BS about his future successes. @jkenney The future is more wrangling and nothing done. @Alberta_UCP So even more risks than currently. The Olympics useless.
2963 2018-11-08 18:23:22 Bitch I don’t drink light liquor. I drink dark remember that oil, it taste like juice. Mfs only had one cuo talking bout “I’m drunk” 
2964 2018-11-08 18:23:13 Someone told me to drop tea tree oil drops into my ear and it worked lol my ear doesn’t hurt anymore. I heard about the cigarette thing after lol but thanks for yalls feed back!!
2965 2018-11-08 18:23:13 It sounds like you've never been around an on-water oil spill. The first thing they look for is a single oil-soaked bird. That one bird triggers a whole new layer of MASSIVE, unlimited funding and response.  I've witnessed it first hand.  Windmill folks have had a pass,
2966 2018-11-08 18:22:49 Near East Development Co. (American) representing: Standard Oil Co. (New Jersey), 11.875 % + Socony-Vaccum Oil Co. 11.875 % = 23.75 % ;
C.S. Gebenkian (Syrian individual of British citizenship) 5 % FLAT
Total = 100 %
2967 2018-11-08 18:22:29 Vicious lie; George paid them up front in Iranian oil.
2968 2018-11-08 18:22:26 I guess so ..but u stand a better chance finding oil in a copper mine ..well as a by product ...
2969 2018-11-08 18:22:24 2 years tak pehlay tak tu acha tha. Haven't ate from there for 2 years now. The guy used to change oil everyday. And the aalo tiki was heavy than a good size samosa.
2970 2018-11-08 18:22:02 Borrowing an air purifier to see if it helps with the dust in my studio.
(also hopefully a little bit with the fumes from oil painting)
Shit's loud, though.
If it works well, I can maybe look into getting a quieter unit.
2971 2018-11-08 18:21:59 A cute college girl just left the waiting room at the oil change place and says to me “nice Jeep” on her way out and I just smile. #thatsnotmyjeep #imintheminivan #companycar #fleetcar
2972 2018-11-08 18:21:57 people keep telling me to try cbd oil as a topical so i was curious.
I'm glad it's working for you.
2973 2018-11-08 18:21:55 What's the thesis for this? Saudi's likely promised (explicitly or implicitly) Trump low oil prices given Saudi Kings tenuous political position... hrmm

2987 2018-11-08 18:20:30 Whatever you do, look up reviews. Range Rovers have mad electrical problems.  Also, look at the cost of ownership. RR oil changes can be expensive.

I’ve had no issues with my MDX.

But if your current car is fine, keep it till the wheels fall off! 
2988 2018-11-08 18:20:21 Yes na
I have to na
Fine boys come and buy your coconut oil ooo
2989 2018-11-08 18:20:18 Yep and in particular rise of price in crude. Situation would have been extremely difficult but crude would have found its way to the market anyway. Without a price surge we probably wouldn’t have seen prod increase. Few economies more oil price sensitive than KRGs
2990 2018-11-08 18:20:17 Try peppermint oil on your temples! If you don’t have that Vick’s is just as effective, I usually do that to stay away from meds and works like a charm

2994 2018-11-08 18:20:03 I need this as a large oil painting!! 
2995 2018-11-08 18:20:03 I want Texas to know that they better crank out 3x as much oil and athletes this year or their days are numbered.
2996 2018-11-08 18:19:54 A Koch funded skeptic(his group was B.E.S.T.) found that we are causing it, and that while we’re going to have change, we can minimize it.
It effects some industries(oil and coal) but is good for others(wind, hydro).
There’ve been a lot of counter-studies. They didn’t disprove it
2997 2018-11-08 18:19:51 I deep condition my hair 1x a week w/ Taliah Waajid repair & restore masque.. I also used the one from Cantu & it was really good as well!

Nancy or Hillary denounce any of these? No.
2999 2018-11-08 18:19:25 It's oil from my bicycle fun. And yes we use lurpak spreadable. I do like real butter but also lurpak spreadable and its greater convenience.
3000 2018-11-08 18:19:16 Oil money counts....or corrupts..
3001 2018-11-08 18:19:12 We turned a blind eye to the 15-Saudis that inflicted the worst assault to the USA since Perl Harbor and instead we went after the guy who could replace our oil supply and we still support one of the most brutal regimes in the world, why is the focus shifting to Europe???
3002 2018-11-08 18:19:05 Olive oil is the best when it comes to hair products. My hair now ♡.

3005 2018-11-08 18:18:41 Olive Oil you more (that’s me blowing you a kiss...get it?! I put my hand over my mouth to blow it lol genius)
3006 2018-11-08 18:18:37 Yeah, been a back and forth affair today.  A bit of pressure on oil stox with crude down for the 9th straight session, and QCOM -7% isn't helping the Nasdaq.  Standard caution w/Fed wrapping up a meeting, although no rate hike is coming this time.
3007 2018-11-08 18:18:28 it's Ash's favorite. (there's a dill flower oil from ikea you should absolutely get)
3008 2018-11-08 18:18:22 Skin looks lovely is that olive oil or some sort of butter
3009 2018-11-08 18:18:19 the lyin from the wh, the hatred and harassment from the right, the white american-citizen men who are terrorists but they’ll keep blaming anyone non-white just for existing, it’s a burning oil spill cesspool of hatred
3010 2018-11-08 18:18:10 It takes huge amounts of $$ to get into the heads of uniformed voters with fake promises & lies, the same way the snake oil was sold by BHO and bought by the uninformed in 2008-16
3011 2018-11-08 18:18:09 Lol boi you look like you change oil for fun

3014 2018-11-08 18:17:44 The ownership of these 3 companies is divided as follows: Royal Dutch-Shell Co. (British and Dutch) 23.75% ; Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. Ltd. (British) 23.75% ; Compagnie Francaise Des Petroles (French) 23.75%
3015 2018-11-08 18:17:30 ... so solid halva would probably be healthier than a refined oil
3016 2018-11-08 18:17:26 I hate the green party. They have screwed us so many times. And Jill Stein is a huge hypocrite millionaire with stocks in big oil, big pharma, etc. I don’t understand why anyone would vote green unless they are totally selfish. Especially this time.
3017 2018-11-08 18:17:25 The biggest insult to military families was to send their loved ones to Iraq on a lie in a war for oil. I don't wear a poppy, and don't criticise those who do. Either way, one thing is evident. Our ruling class cares nothing for working class soldiers, 13K now homeless.
3018 2018-11-08 18:17:17 By Jarurat the oil will fall by atleast 10$ per barrel. Mitron ye sab prabhu ki leela hai.

3023 2018-11-08 18:16:21 Its a disgrace that anyone is homeless and all governments in the last 40 years are to blame. We were short of housing, roads are gridlock and they wasted billions in oil money. We have elected idiots for the last 40 years and that's a fact

3027 2018-11-08 18:15:33 Thanks for the tag Mehul 

So here’s what I think. No lip balm will heal chapped lips. It’ll only maintain. It’s possible you’re dehydrated & have deficiencies. 
Also you need exfoliation. Get a lip scrub or make own using sugar, honey, olive oil. For lip balm try burts n bees
3028 2018-11-08 18:15:31 Wishing I had some Holy oil to sprinkle over my Genetics exam today....

3032 2018-11-08 18:15:08 Yes. If my water tap is leaky, I still have to pay my water bill.  This gas, whilst in the ground, belongs to us. It has value. Why do we let oil companies squander it and not pay for it?
3033 2018-11-08 18:15:06 I insist, stick to selling this snake oil stuff! Hahaha!

3040 2018-11-08 18:14:17 Oooo definitely try the sheet masks & the honey + tumeric + lemon! It helps sooo much. They should sell a lb of tumeric at Indian market for like $5...
& get some rose water & almond oil!
3041 2018-11-08 18:14:12 And economists for free trade are a bunch of snake oil salesmen.

Come and buy
3045 2018-11-08 18:13:44 It will be interesting to see if the world is stupid enough to finance it. Will Japan, China , Brazil , oil exporters et al be stupid enough to buy the US's debt to pay for it, is the question.
3046 2018-11-08 18:13:40 Sounds like you have a gripe with petrocorps screwing consumers trough their monopoly. So we agree, break up oil companies. 
Still not a tax.
3047 2018-11-08 18:13:31 I know you guys are super eager to get your La Bella CBD oil skin care. Thank you so much for your patience, you guys are the true OGs.

I will do a reveal as soon as I can - I promise. Trust me I am so looking forward to our official launch!


3048 2018-11-08 18:13:28 Okay,veggie daughter, get extra firm tofu. Marinate for 30 minutes in mixture of liquid smoke,anchovy paste and reconstitute dried criminis. Save liquid, strained of grit. Flash fry tofu sautee in peanut oil, shrooms added and guarantee steak flavor. Garlic&onion 2 taste

3050 2018-11-08 18:13:11 Many of these are long term things to do. In the short term to avoid negative rumination - Take fish oil, moderate intensity exercise, sunlight/sun lamp, Vit D, hang out with friends, meditate, laugh (watch funny videos)!
3051 2018-11-08 18:13:06 Success not inevitable though. There's a lot of reasons for success, including (but not limited to) increase in price of oil and the life lines by Russia, Turkey, and others (at terms that are not known).
3052 2018-11-08 18:12:54 Simply because we are not prepared to transition "cold turkey" as much of our daily lives are linked to oil. Gradually, society is modernizing but meanwhile, nobody wants to give away their cars. Many are working on this but they're faced with opposition. 1/2
3053 2018-11-08 18:12:48 Three hours until we take the field at Lucas Oil Stadium for our Prelims performance...we are ready to #RiseAbove for #BOA2018 !!!!
3054 2018-11-08 18:12:46 I’m not against using oil for plastics in many cases. There are cellulose based formulas that will become more competitive when oil is no longer subsidized so heavily as well.
3055 2018-11-08 18:12:37 WW1 Tommies died for oil, power, influence and land grab, not for our  freedom as successive governments and others like to sell it. People don't like to hear that but rudimentary research confirms it as a fact. Service personnel used and abused? You bet.
3056 2018-11-08 18:12:29 Much better! Now, where's my glass of ice cold milk?

3059 2018-11-08 18:12:13 We have free education, too. And if y'all weren't ripping us off on oil prices we'd have really cheap gas!
3060 2018-11-08 18:11:54 That's bullshit as they clearly keep saying "In god we trust"
Unless they mean Gold Oil & Drugs
3061 2018-11-08 18:11:49 Noooo! Into the pan,fry in the oil. Cholesterol heaven. 
3062 2018-11-08 18:11:47 No he did NOT. People like you are convincing me how flawed out justice must be delivering convictions of the innocent. Suddenly everyone's Jesus Christ

I am an early and unabating TrumpSupporter, and here I am alone in reading this truthfully and objectively. Pity.

3067 2018-11-08 18:10:47 high heat cooking more of a problem than the oil itself.
3068 2018-11-08 18:10:27 The CO2 intensity (kg per kg of oil equivalent energy use) of Georgia was 2.04737463504485 in 2014.
3069 2018-11-08 18:10:27 Those tests aside, in 'real money' terms, the contract cost (to date) is not a very sizeable sum (comparing to e.g IT Programme spend, or Oil/Gas exploration costs). 

The return - for continued funding - is of enormous value to the nation, at a very tangible human level.

3077 2018-11-08 18:09:26 With above ground oil tanks, the removal process is more straightforward than with an underground removal. Here, the chief concern is going to be the accessibility of the tank as well as the tank size if it needs to be removed from inside the premises.
3078 2018-11-08 18:09:25 The gDP per unit of energy use (PPP $ per kg of oil equivalent) of South Sudan was 33.5824419701576 in 2014.

3084 2018-11-08 18:08:59 I washed and proceeded to make my hair without using any essential oil or Shea butter. Risky risky business
3085 2018-11-08 18:08:58 #Keto in the supplement world is so gimmicky. Sellers are like, “here is out keto creamer complete with MCT oil, motor oil, organic cane sugar”.

Me: da fuq is this? ...

First off sugar is not keto, 
secondly fuck outa here.
3086 2018-11-08 18:08:55 Omg I should try to be friends with oil color... I've never used that before (I got it from a friend) and I haven't even tried to mix colors as well as I do with my water color. The only thing I can draw with oil color is sunflower haha
3087 2018-11-08 18:08:54 Coconut oil!
3088 2018-11-08 18:08:43 Ah yes of course ,why oh why did I never think of that ?...NO that's heating them up in oil they are already cooked there is no fking frying ( had this discussion with a flat mate 40 odd years ago) 
3089 2018-11-08 18:08:41 LoL.... I guess the Ref's have a "code" as well.

3094 2018-11-08 18:08:03 plastic comes from OIL - we need urgently replacement from plastics.
3095 2018-11-08 18:08:02 Use vegetable oil 
3096 2018-11-08 18:07:58 It's wedding season and every brand will cash on it be it tea, biscuit, soda, or cooking oil.
3097 2018-11-08 18:07:58 I’d choose the Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Masque! My hair needs all the moisture it can get 
3098 2018-11-08 18:07:49 This dude almost set the class on fire adding frozen onions to hot oil
3099 2018-11-08 18:07:37 The message is isolationist; it is not helpful for keeping a line of communication open. It may seem like there is nothing to communicate about today, but that may not be the case next year or next decade.  

So Saudi oil = bad? Are they OK for Canada to keep selling them LAV's?
3100 2018-11-08 18:07:29 falling oil prices dont necessarily mean better margins. Look at gasoline cracks thaey have fallen massively lately mainly due to overproduction while diesel cracks have skyrocketed because market does not seem to e able to make enough
3101 2018-11-08 18:07:27 Trump Aberdeen? Oil rigs in the background
3102 2018-11-08 18:07:06 Try Kratom as well as lavender oil
3103 2018-11-08 18:06:59 Also, Beto doesn’t support our oil and gas industry and that’s how I pay my bills.
3104 2018-11-08 18:06:50 I should oil my motorcycle... #MinkBot
3105 2018-11-08 18:06:42 Does beard oil do anything other than make it smell okay?
3106 2018-11-08 18:06:26 I always have a Margarita, with a drizzle of Nando's XX Hot and a drizzle of olive oil.
3107 2018-11-08 18:06:26 Once again it shows that a fireplace has many advantages compared to an oil or gas burner.

A heartfelt thank you to David, who tells us about English traditions.
3108 2018-11-08 18:06:25 Oh seriously what bull
3109 2018-11-08 18:06:12 Most politicians are snake oil salesman really due to the nature of the job, if anything trump is the least snakeoil like president from the last 20 years. A Wysiwyg president if you will.
3110 2018-11-08 18:06:12 Supply and demand, nobody wants low grade oil when WTI and Brent are affordable.
3111 2018-11-08 18:06:09 I gave no lies... you just can't read. Also "oil counties" lol

Beto whiners are the worst of sore losers, but at least you have enough sense to not try and torch Dallas or Houston in "protest" 

Cuz you'd just get shot. LOL
3112 2018-11-08 18:06:06 I don’t know why , its the rural areas mostly ranchers , oil people . I so sad

Excuse me while I down this bottle of grain alcohol to think about this one.
3116 2018-11-08 18:05:50 I have no doubt they complain behind closed doors & some think McLellan should blow a gasket after a game but I think that's counterproductive. I don't want to believe it but I'm starting to think McDavid's pointing to the scoreboard last year hasn't helped w/ some refs.
3117 2018-11-08 18:05:20 There's the aspirational Exxon that exists only on paper and wispy adverts and the real, drenched-in-oil Exxon.

3121 2018-11-08 18:05:08 CBD oil! I started taking this for RA and it has greatly improved my depression/anxiety.
3122 2018-11-08 18:05:03 Oil supplies around the globe are increasing and are nearing bear market. Weak demand for oil is a sign of global economic weakness. $USO. #oilandgas
3123 2018-11-08 18:04:51 Don't forget to ask for a few thousand barrels of oil..
3124 2018-11-08 18:04:51 did you forget something other then tan oil?

3133 2018-11-08 18:04:06 Hollywood is so insulated from, well everyone outside of their bubble. When is the last time you talked to a truck driver, an oil rigger, a rancher or farmer! These are the people that actually run this country!
3134 2018-11-08 18:04:03 is there good area for bid oil? or still not clear?
3135 2018-11-08 18:03:50 ... fried cassava leaves n rice for dinner while munching on some fried plantains chips watching Chelsea FC do their thing is not a bad idea at all. Conscious of d oil though. #TrueBlue

3138 2018-11-08 18:03:35 Mara why ri ri ndi fish oil
3139 2018-11-08 18:03:32 The pay gap doesn’t exist. Men take more dangerous jobs, and with danger comes more pay. Oil riggers, underwater welding, dangerous jobs with a lot of risk. Men are twice as likely to die in the workplace. And consequently get paid more, danger = more pay.
3140 2018-11-08 18:03:31 He most likely had to shoot a Beard Oil commercial with his bro. Nothing to see here, moving on ...
3141 2018-11-08 18:03:20 Or keep more oil local
3142 2018-11-08 18:03:19 Our neighbors finally moved & were smoking it all night & day! I could not walk, my legs were numb, my brain in a fog I was high for 12 hrs without smoking it! Children are in a fog because of second hand! This stuff does not cure anything unless in cbd oil form for cancer.
3143 2018-11-08 18:03:08 Good afternoon everyone, Napleton Auto Park of Urbana has a great servicecenter. Right now we have a special on oil change and tire rotation for $49 in 49 min or its free
3144 2018-11-08 18:03:08 @xScarlettJonesx Use more oil if you like,,,,,,,,,,,,,but NEVER lose the landing strip!!!!!!
3145 2018-11-08 18:03:07 Cynical? Realist! On the G1 now - if we were farm animals you'd not be allowed to transport us like this! Even sardines get olive oil!
3146 2018-11-08 18:03:07 Juice biko....the oil is the juice
3147 2018-11-08 18:03:07 Olive oil is from the fruit (the olive, not it’s seed). Seed oil is from seeds (ie sunflower, canola) & often sold as “Vegetable oil”
3148 2018-11-08 18:03:05 Good for Elizabeth May for speaking out about oil patch liabilities. When that time comes, as surely as history shows it will, there won’t be any pot of treasure on earth big enough to restore the oil sands.

3151 2018-11-08 18:02:46 I didn't think you could get any hotter...and then you got the oil out and proved me wrong. 
3152 2018-11-08 18:02:42 @neiltyson friendly bet, steak dinner when plastic is worth more per gallon than oil?
3153 2018-11-08 18:02:33 Please outline the success dumb and dumber have had getting our oil to market....this should be enlightening to us all...or this tweet will go dormant. I’m betting on the latter....
3154 2018-11-08 18:02:30 In RDR2 we’ve dressed up as Bill the Butcher, Calvin Candie and Daniel Plainview during the oil rig explosion 
3155 2018-11-08 18:02:26 26.  EVOLUTION says that when things have got one or two similarities they are the same thing but at different stages of evolution.
-  Yet we know oil and orange juice look alike when in a bottle.  Both flow when poured on a flat surface but have not evolved from the same CELL.
3156 2018-11-08 18:02:25 I don’t trust a bitch who is 1K miles over needing to get an oil change.
3157 2018-11-08 18:02:25 Holy fucking shit how the hell can an oil change THAT I HAD AN APPOINTMENT FOR take over an hour
3158 2018-11-08 18:02:20 What are the Oilers trying to do about it I wonder, hard for McDavid to complain about it. Makes me sick watching this game after game.
3159 2018-11-08 18:02:14 Have been sealed with the Holy Spirit.  SO THEN, if they are "saved", and sealed, then the OIL can not be the SEALING of the spirit, but rather related to the FILLING of the Spirit, which many Christians today HAVE NOT experienced, I believe.
3160 2018-11-08 18:02:09 its ah slim chance ill fall olive oil
3161 2018-11-08 18:02:02 I love tissue oil. It's like lube for your tight jeans 
3162 2018-11-08 18:01:57 I’m getting ready to leave work and I told melissa to pray for me that I pass my exam. This bitch goes “I’m gonna need a Virgin Mary candle, an egg, and tea tree oil.”  oh lawd
3163 2018-11-08 18:01:53 At this pace of decline everyone involved in the oil business will be hurting big time.
3164 2018-11-08 18:01:42 Valve adjustment was critical - notionally needed a special tool from Honda... or long nose pliers (me) and more frequent inspection. Check oil & valves every 3000 maximum. The poor little things were thrashed to death
3165 2018-11-08 18:01:40 Screw that, get the kettle of hot oil!
3166 2018-11-08 18:01:30 Too much oil
3167 2018-11-08 18:01:24 It’s like you can do almost everything you’d do in the oven or stovetop in the air fryer using minimal oil and time. @strangURdanger how would you explain an air fryer?!
3168 2018-11-08 18:01:20 Research CBD oil. Get one made from Industrial Hemp. No THC. Legal in all 50 states. I’ve had great results. Helps with dealing with people during the day. Great night sleep in the evening. I like Elixinol brand.
3169 2018-11-08 18:01:17 HOWEVER, if a Virgin is ALIVE at His coming, there is a need to do something special that was not apparently necessary before this point. Have OIL IN YOUR LAMP. Remember, all 10 virgins are ALREADY called virgins in our example, meerly by following Rom 10:9-10.  And as such...

3173 2018-11-08 18:00:54 electric cars should be even more perfect, much cheaper than they are now. They should destroy the oil bastards

3177 2018-11-08 18:00:28 @HawaiiCars1 I have a lease on a 2106 fiesta, do i have to get services done at your facility, or can i get the oil changed at the #jiffylube next to my house?
3178 2018-11-08 18:00:12 Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) from coconut oil may prove to be a viable antibacterial and antiviral alternative.
3179 2018-11-08 18:00:11 FP is very successful. US support 4 entry into MTCR and LEMOA to stand up to China in South China Sea while still buying Russian arms and Iranian oil. 1st time since 1947, India is fastest growing country. Rapid progress towards Bank a/c, toilets, cooking gas, electricity for all
3180 2018-11-08 18:00:10 That's not vile. Calling people out for snake oil therapy isn't wrong.
What's wrong is people using completely unproven treatments for serious conditions. Some people take $ to treat people's cancer with bleach, but you think I'm worse than that?

3183 2018-11-08 17:59:42 Stockcats for sure has a point....But now the damage has been done and no one is going to pay up any oil unless inventories start to at least stabilize. If US inventories keep on heading for 500m+ get ready for WTI sub 50 next year.
3184 2018-11-08 17:59:32 I can understand where the drs come from. Imagine being in their shoes. 

Say they prescribe cannabis oil and somebody dies. Instantly its a media frenzy and the Dr is struck of and career is destroyed.
3185 2018-11-08 17:59:31 Get some peppermint oil, put about a tbs in a squirt bottle, and then add water to fill up the bottle. Shake it up every time you use it. Would recommend using it around where they enter. Sorry you’re dealing with this :(
3186 2018-11-08 17:59:27 Fellow Kings with Beard ! If you can’t afford Argan oil or those Beards oils , use coconut  oil , it keeps it very soft, healthy and stable throughout the whole day
3187 2018-11-08 17:59:26 Waited until I was 10,000 miles over to get my oil changed on my leased car I’m the WORST
3188 2018-11-08 17:59:23 Snake oil. Take a guess how much personal experience means? My niece was amazed that "Santa" bit her cookie, doesn't mean it's real. The irony is, she has more evidence in support of Santa (a physical eaten cookie) than any of you do for your god.
3189 2018-11-08 17:59:13 oh girrrl!!!! cut them into halves, make a mix of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, some black pepper and salt and drizzle it over them. grill for ca. 20min or so until slightly brown. Delish!

3203 2018-11-08 17:57:56 I'd pay someone to take my car to get and oil change, check the oil and cause I just can't, it's too much work
3204 2018-11-08 17:57:35 Haha...yup they are hurting. And probably annoyed at KSA for bending over to subsidize prices for the US consumer, at expense of oil producing nations
3205 2018-11-08 17:57:27 Canada doesn’t buy their oil. Irving does. Are you telling private businesses where they can buy from?
3206 2018-11-08 17:57:08 Electric cars need to be the new norm. There’s no reason to still use fossil fuels especially when we have electric cars driving around. It’s the Big Oil Companies that are stopping the progression and fucking up the climate daily.

So I bought a soft pretzel instead.

3214 2018-11-08 17:55:59 $/CL #Crude working on its 9th straight daily decline. This hasn't happened since late March 2016, and we didn't even get 9 straight during the oil crash of '14-'15. Has the bullish narrative finally run its course?

3224 2018-11-08 17:55:24 Ah yes, peak oil. Because oil will never get more expensive as it grows more scarce. We'll just suddenly run out of it one day.

3226 2018-11-08 17:55:19 I have caught tench, but never an eel. Tench slime is apparently good for the skin (if a bit smelly) and it oozes off them so it's easy to get.
Probably have to do more squishing to get eel oil

3245 2018-11-08 17:53:34 We have more oil than the Saudi's
Also Khashoggi was much more than a journalist... He could be in hidden someplace trying to create this issue.

3247 2018-11-08 17:53:19 I beg to disagree

The chemstry here is visible.

It really proves that oil and water do not mix

3261 2018-11-08 17:52:19 Chia seeds actually provide more omega 3 per serving, and a tablespoon of flaxseed oil contains twice as much. If supplementing, cut out the middle man and get algae-derived omega 3 oil - that's where fish get their omega 3 from!
3262 2018-11-08 17:52:14 Some doctors are just terrible human beings. 

Patient was feeling "the best she ever had in her life" with CBD oil. 

Goes to see her psychiatrist - puts her on Seroquel, stops CBD and cuts her disability. Now she cannot afford her CBD oil and all her previous symptoms returned.
3263 2018-11-08 17:52:08 We all grew just so exhausted.

The fatigue spread across our skin like oil and sank through muscle tissue, then wormed its way deep into the bones…until our bodies were thoroughly suffused, dense with its saturation, weary so far beyond our years…

3266 2018-11-08 17:51:40 If I remember correctly Russia will sell Iran's refined oil on the world market as its own. That would be even better.

3274 2018-11-08 17:50:43 In QP @GerryRogersMHA says $1.38B in new exploration bids for province’s offshore oil & gas industry is pretty significant. In 2010 offshore helicopter safety report Justice Wells said most important recommendation was #29 calling for independent offshore safety authority #nlpoli
3275 2018-11-08 17:50:38 the oil trade: the experts are baffled. we noted the day that opec actually said they are pumping as much as possible (to play nice nice with the US). That was the day to get out of longs.  $CL_F $USO

3277 2018-11-08 17:50:25 Most people still don't know the truth. And newbies are always vulnerable to snake oil salespeople. Hence, 10 years later, we still see the same mistakes.
3278 2018-11-08 17:50:09 Why be shocked by this? Wars for oil, sick Vets, and failed #GunControl are preventable. But we don’t prevent them.
3279 2018-11-08 17:50:05 Exactly. The snake oil will be sold and available everywhere.

3282 2018-11-08 17:49:52 I worry about the lack of investment in oil and gas supply and distribution. The greater reliance upon ruinables...and the new scarcity in investment capital.

Its less than 1bn 

Doh
3289 2018-11-08 17:48:19 sure, they pay royalties but that doesn't count because the oil and gas belongs to the public via the Crown.

3292 2018-11-08 17:48:00 Disheartening that people value profit over well-being of future generations. I bought an electric car (Model 3), sold all investments in oil, invested in Tesla. Now saving money in long term (no more gas), investment already up! If more people do the same, oil will die.

Maybe we shouldn't be destroying peoples' minds with PTSD before they even grow up.

Maybe the government should care.

3315 2018-11-08 17:45:08 An oil-based cleanser can be great for dry, sensitive, or mature skin because it will nourish the skin barrier and hydrate. However, if your skin is already oily and/or acne prone, you’ll want avoid the oil and go with a water-based gel cleanser.

3340 2018-11-08 17:42:38 President Trump is not a saint, or gold or oil that suits all human beings, but sometimes has the accurate truth of their actions, but unfortunately exposes them in bad manners and with an autocratic character, moving away and trampling democracy from the country.
3341 2018-11-08 17:42:32 Sam thought his mother will see naina's beauty but seems vishaka is impressed with naina's  thinking n how she made Sam to think about exercising for Salman looks over oil. Naina will make him responsible him in her which vishaka couldn't never do  #yehundinonkibaathai
3342 2018-11-08 17:42:18 Off shore I think. Scotland have rights to it possibly as part of devolution agreement. You have just reached the limits of my knowledge. Wales also does free prescriptions and they don’t have oil. It’s about ideaology & the per capita value of the settlement from central govt.
3343 2018-11-08 17:42:02 “Why am I breaking out again?” I wonder as I rub another layer of rosehip oil on my face.
3344 2018-11-08 17:42:02 I need another Nars chubby lip pencil thing in Dolce Vita, maybe some cleansing oil? You can tell I know how to party.
3345 2018-11-08 17:41:49 TIL don't use a paper towel to apply oil onto a cutting board, all ot does is force paper particles into the pores of the wood.
3346 2018-11-08 17:41:41 That may have been what it was meant for. Or very small batch olive oil. :)

3349 2018-11-08 17:41:28 My dad told me to go get an oil change and say NO to everything else so I did and he told me what they tell me and I was like oh they tried getting me pay $20 to rotate my tires and now he’s mad bc he said that was cheap and I should have done it lmfaoo I can’t win here
3350 2018-11-08 17:41:24 That's why I always get my snake oil from reputable sources.

3358 2018-11-08 17:40:23 @mattyglesias is like a scientific experiment gone terribly wrong.
3359 2018-11-08 17:40:11 On a slightly different note, does it look as if WTI is in oversold territory at the moment?  I swung DWT from 7 but thinking of exiting and catching it again lower. But of course if the market falls, oil could go with it.  Thanks!

3362 2018-11-08 17:39:53 Well, think about it now.... We used to think OIL was vital to LIFE & $ but now we know for sure that the new necessity of LIFE is ICE & SNOW bc global warming. It's getting hotter & hotter so it's now time to go after *our* cold lands. Makes life more comfortable. #MEGA
3363 2018-11-08 17:39:42 There was a special oil for it, it’s been so long I forget what it was called now

3368 2018-11-08 17:39:04 Oh okay. They don’t sell oil in stores yet, not here anyway. Anytime I’ve looked online they want a prescription.
3369 2018-11-08 17:38:55 Noble face oil is not in my budget right now sorry 
3370 2018-11-08 17:38:51 i’m so paranoid that i thought the guys that gave me an oil change put gasses in my car so i had my windows down the whole way to meijer
3371 2018-11-08 17:38:49 Recipe: In a casserole dish or slow cooker, lightly grease with butter or vegetable oil. Unroll pre-made pie crust and line along bottom. Whisk together eggs, milk, salt & pepper. Shred pre-cooked turkey and sprinkle ontop of pie crust with shredded cheese, can diced tomatoes,
3372 2018-11-08 17:38:46 What do I use to get oil or grease stains off a black shirt/sweater?
3373 2018-11-08 17:38:33 Capitalism lowers CO2. Don’t believe me? Look at what the oil sands have achieved in the last decade.
3374 2018-11-08 17:38:24 That was thanks to the $30M spent by the oil and gas industry to brainwash the CO voters. The disinformation campaign was shocking ... and not at all surprising.
3375 2018-11-08 17:38:22 Man it’d be dope if I could get sponsored like athletes do, except for writing. Like instead of Klay Thompson talking about benefits of chocolate milk, the ad would just be me holding a gallon of CBD oil like: “Hi! I write things, except I often don’t, and also I’m very anxious.”
3376 2018-11-08 17:38:21 Just passed a McLaren on a beat up west Texas country road. What you think? Oil money? lol

3378 2018-11-08 17:38:11 Lived in Indiana my entire life and have yet to make it to Indy for a game. I still remember the RCA Dome and when they built Lucas Oil. Would love to be able to check this stadium off my list.

3380 2018-11-08 17:38:06 Shake off your stupors shake up here separations shake off your guilt and you're condemnations who God says I have forgiven you and cleanse you from all unrighteousness wake up trim your lamp for your love shows your oil being low if you have no oil you need to come to the Lord
3381 2018-11-08 17:38:02 But if they send coupons maintenance oil little things are often cheapest at the dealer. And they send xmas cards.
3382 2018-11-08 17:37:54 So as part of this political opposition to our owners can I presume you have never travelled in a car or flown on a plane? I'm sure you have never used plastic or any other oil based product either? Just wondering if your political opposition is solely Twitter based?
3383 2018-11-08 17:37:46 As winter weather is quickly approaching, don't forget to:

- check your tire pressure
- check your car battery
- check your spare tire's pressure
- go get a god damn oil change/tire rotation so your car won't break down, & cause more unnecessary traffic during holiday season
3384 2018-11-08 17:37:26 @womanfeeds aku pake fresh herb dan baru search serum mngndung oil bikin jerawatan tp aku ga sampe acne syukur

3386 2018-11-08 17:37:17 where’s this damn grape seed oil ? 
3387 2018-11-08 17:37:10 Did Sam wanted to buy oil to build body like Salman Khan. Is he d same boy who laughed at naina when she was praying for man chaha var?  #yehundinonkibaathai
3388 2018-11-08 17:36:44 Look at Devan Dubnyk for instance. Was terrible in the Oilers crease move him to Pheonix and instantly he’s great. They trade him to Wild and he’s a star. Don’t think it’s the team I whole heartedly believe it’s the trainers. Pheonix was a lot worse than the Oil at the times imo.
3389 2018-11-08 17:36:38 Essential oils, coconut oil, and prayers obvi.
3390 2018-11-08 17:36:36 I jut dropped my car off at Walmart to get an oil change I’m getting my tires balanced and rotated later this week on my day off at my uncles garage but an oil change is cheaper at Walmart BUT the line that makes my hood pop open like to come loose to where we can’t pop it
3391 2018-11-08 17:36:23 But the price of oil could go down. Such a burden.
3392 2018-11-08 17:36:09 Oil did go down here..From 2.79 a gallon to 2.51 . I'm happy about that here in Georgia.

3394 2018-11-08 17:35:58 Only part of the story - what is the environmental impact on water?  Soil?  Wildlife? Short term solution to a very long term problem - this speaks of Pro oil propaganda
3395 2018-11-08 17:35:44 He doesn't want to raise our taxes. Patrick O'Rourke or whatever his name is wants to put a ten dollar tax on every barrel of oil which could hurt Texas and as a republican he is for jobs not mobs. I proudly stand by him and Trump because I want a better future for my children.
3396 2018-11-08 17:35:32 Should United win this weekend the narrative will be “Pep’s a fraud, City are overrated, Manchester is Red, Pogba > KDB.”

Should City win it’ll be “dirty oil money, human rights, corrupt cunts, cheats, Sterling dived, Emptyhad, 20 times.”

Canny wait
3397 2018-11-08 17:35:22 It’s so funny to see people arguing over whether mental illness, NRA or Trump is the problem when I’m all honesty the world has been this way since the dawn of men.. wars over sugar, oil and owning people. Ha! Save your breath nothing is going change #CaliforniaShooting

3414 2018-11-08 17:33:30 True, though I think the first five of those ten years were going to be painful whoever was in charge because of the new stadium (back before the ‘TV money’ and ‘oil money’) and then some decisions were made assuming FFP actually happened - he just failed to play that game 
3415 2018-11-08 17:33:30 It's a good massage oil and natural lube w anti-bacterial properties, smells good, plus it doesn't stain your sheets.

3420 2018-11-08 17:33:09 So apparently 2 self stable ingredients (balsamic vinegar and olive oil) magically go back after 7 days when you mix them together...go fuck yourself "health inspector"!
3421 2018-11-08 17:33:08 I've been to a few Oil Kings games like that, and the ears take a shift kicking bigtime Pauly.  So, not sure if you're an NBA fan but I have a feeling living in Milwaukee you're going to have to become one! The bucks are the real deal buddy.  Go check out the #GreekFreak

And check any pets to make sure your kids didn't give it to them too. Very very common with kids. Its a glorious right of passage. hahaha

3431 2018-11-08 17:32:25 Reporters ask questions, they don't lecture the president on what to do. Check the video again, Trump even appreciated him but Acosta wanted to be the president that minute and refused to release the mic with him. The guy was rude!

3437 2018-11-08 17:31:36 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

Brent Crude down around 71.14
3463 2018-11-08 17:27:58 Petrocurrency was why. Same w/Gathafi. SD & Gathafi both pulled oil from US petrocurrency to Africa and then they were murdered.
3464 2018-11-08 17:27:43 It's never about issues with the left. It's about manufacuring an external cause for their mental imbalances and railing against it. It's therapeutic for them.

3467 2018-11-08 17:27:33 Oil collapsing ….
3468 2018-11-08 17:27:15 My grandfather's cohort did not return from WWI (the war to end all wars) to shoot up the hood. WWII cohort neither....

Certainly mental health plays a role: PTSD, and perhaps the sublimation of the knowledge that fighting for oil and poppies is not a noble endeavor....
3469 2018-11-08 17:27:12 Yup they are messing with me big time not a doubt in my mind. My own father has too much power and wished me dead drown down an oil well I moved 1/2 way across the country to escape but I always look over my shoulder so I'm used to it. No news is good news. I know too much
3470 2018-11-08 17:27:09 So you would rather have the oil moved in dirty trucks and trains through our cities?
3471 2018-11-08 17:27:02 Maybe @CuadrillaUK have finally seen the light and will abort Oil & Gas drilling. There's no future in Fracking, so will invest in #GeoThermalEnergy exploration instead!

3478 2018-11-08 17:26:24 Our oil money, is our money they meant to pay higher than what they are paying. This is just means of getting loyalty from Nigerians
3479 2018-11-08 17:26:21 I think crude touches 55 bucks at which time it's a great buy IMO. Fib retrace and double top pattern also confirms this.

3481 2018-11-08 17:26:08 The whole world deserves a bright future, free from the stranglehold of Big Oil. If @POTUS would return control of the U.S. Patent Office to #WeThePeople, and release the over 5,000 alternative energy patents from "national security" suppression, we could truly #MAGA!

3485 2018-11-08 17:25:50 We need to rebuild that. Just one facility here, western digital, out revenued all oil by 500% during the 1990's and early 2000's. Until bushy pushed oil, oil, oil for no reason.

3487 2018-11-08 17:25:46 That has this economy doing so well, stock market, black unemployment historically low, more jobs than people, because of his policies, US to surpass Saudi Arabia in oil production, created Right To Try. There is so much more. And he’s right on immigration
3488 2018-11-08 17:25:46 Sir agar crude oil manda hai to petrol ki kimat itni jada  kyu hai
3489 2018-11-08 17:25:40 Possible and probable are completely different things.
I don't think there's any need to feed the hysteria.
A ship with a minimal radar signature + no AIS got nailed by a huge commercial oil tanker in the dark at 3am; Russia isn't the 1st most likely thing on the list IMO.

3493 2018-11-08 17:25:12 Do you still think oil is a good buy ?? This keeps on going down USD 2 per week.

3497 2018-11-08 17:24:55 This is a really powerful message. It shows us how all the oil and other stuff in our fast-food is bad for us, almost lile cancer, but it comes really slow, like a turtle, and always gets overlooked.

3509 2018-11-08 17:23:19 A story:
Bishop, while visiting our Confirmation class, learned that one of the kids had never been baptized. So what did he do? He got some water in the font, some candles, some oil and baptized her right then and there. Kind of Acts 8-ish, no?
3510 2018-11-08 17:22:57 The EU is the most successful international government organization outside of the UN. They have universal open borders between each other. The biggest economic boom in the US outside of gold/oil rushes was the influx of illegal German and Irish immigrants in the 1800s.
3511 2018-11-08 17:22:55 Lead tainted snake oil salesman's dopey poll goes the wrong way, then spins it. To sell more lead tainted snake oil.

3514 2018-11-08 17:22:48 I need to buy some oil or something so I can actually make it through Movember.. I already failed.. I hate an ichy beard..
3515 2018-11-08 17:22:22 Mackerel. I’ve read it’s best for heart health due to all the oil, and it can be raised/fished sustainably, so it’s best for environment.
3516 2018-11-08 17:22:19 Yes, the plan was always to keep it for first couple of years operation, the only in synchronous condenser mode. So there are some thins out there tied to oil that were edging on need for reinvstment on old timeline, and then needed to be reconsidered as timeline changed.
3517 2018-11-08 17:21:59 The simple truth is our continued dependency on imported oil (although less now) is the primary reason we need to cozy up with the Saudis.  Accelerate sustainable energy development and then dictate terms to Saudi.
3518 2018-11-08 17:21:52 We need solar energy. Burning wood is not an option in inner cities. The air is choked with smog as it is+not getting better any time soon. Solar +wind and geothermal energy not coal+oil is way to go to save planet!
Small cars are better!Stop overconsuming+laying waste the world.
3519 2018-11-08 17:21:46 if super markets with free funds start selling cooking oil they toll manufactured with you, how will you differentiate between them and people who are buying from you in Bond notes and selling in USD ?

3535 2018-11-08 17:20:04 @tferriss hi Tim!  Love your podcasts!  Do you recommend any Canadian suppliers of CBD oil?  Charlottes Web requires import documentation.  Not sure how to get that.  Thank you!
3536 2018-11-08 17:20:02 I'm just going to say this and go... any Benz you take in for maintenance expect to pay a minimum of 800-3000 per service that isn't an oil change
3537 2018-11-08 17:19:59 same!! diluted tea tree oil is the only thing that will heal some of my really stubborn blemishes. it even helps my lips heal faster if they crack in the winter. i’m sad to see it on the bad list

3550 2018-11-08 17:18:42 That maybe true, that’s doesn’t make me an idiot though does it. I’m not the simpleton who cannot correlate that corrupt finance is pernicious throughout football. I also understand the link between petrol and oil. Now go back to hugging the heffer
3551 2018-11-08 17:18:40 I want all the pipelines, doesnt make sense importing oil when we have an abundance here. My issue is why we didn't do this 10 years ago? and what can you do when provinces like BC and Quebec deny any pipeline on their land?
3552 2018-11-08 17:18:37 Whosoever told Africans to add groundnut oil to almost-finished chocolate, is still a debated topic. Legend has it that it was a survival technique but we still don’t know.
3553 2018-11-08 17:18:33 That does seem to be the conclusion, doesn't it? Iceland mince pies are palm oil free, so I'm stocking up on those.
3554 2018-11-08 17:18:05 Yes!!! It’s kind of annoying bc it’s oil so ur a little greasy until it dries but it’s really good for dry skin. I saw target adds vitamin E to theirs tho so I might just buy the travel size for 20 again

3556 2018-11-08 17:18:02 I have a great deal of difficulty with my body not processing cannabis oil at all unless I take it with food, so since I eat 2 meals a day, that’s when I take it.

3565 2018-11-08 17:17:00 Try a fresh salmon filet on the grill (indirect heat) with a lil olive oil and dill brushed on top.  Throw some would chips in the fire for some smoke flavor.  Garnish with lemon and pair with a cool sauv blanc or chard.

3575 2018-11-08 17:16:07 2) Mid terms are over Trump is broadcasting how he caused oil to go down with Iran deal.  On the backside KSA already leaked they’re signalling a after the JTTC meeting Monday.  Fact is they already cut as exports have been reverted back to non OCED 5 weeks ago.
3576 2018-11-08 17:15:57 Majekodunmi: when oil prices declined it put a lot of pressure on oil producing economies and there were a lot of defaults on loans to the oil sector.

3585 2018-11-08 17:15:09 Brave. When you see what certain ngo get away with because big oil are the bad guys it makes sense. Also I remember the joy in wider oil when shell got done for reserves inflation. Unbridled joy
3586 2018-11-08 17:15:09 I’ve realised whenever my feet get extremely dry it’s because I need a pedicure. Otherwise I use baby oil as soon as I get out of the shower and I’m good for the day

3589 2018-11-08 17:14:50 It’s common knowledge that wars are fought over oil.

What isn’t common knowledge is that hemp can do everything oil can. Legalizing cannabis can literally stop wars.

3609 2018-11-08 17:12:52 And of course everybody in the new party will be Max clones, doing exactly as he says and does. Until somebody starts talking about shutting down the oil industry, diversity matters, and then the newbies will all point their finger to the door. No chance for error here.

They then realize why not take100 with them. If it isn't via a gun, it would be a car/truck, arson, poisons, whatever. Stop glorifying it

Perhaps the government promoting fear for political reasons.

3664 2018-11-08 17:06:43 If you support a status quo that sees 13,000 veterans homeless and governments off loading responsibility to charities, then it's you who are not a patriot.

3670 2018-11-08 17:06:30 The pipelines already exist! The companies are trying to make them newer and safer, as well as get their product to market.  That must make sense to you. Other markets are also discounted (auto, aviation) but oil is sexy to hate on.

Next time your oil change guy does something wrong with your vehicle and breaks something just say oh it's ok I'll just go back because that's what he does. No one does that ever.

3684 2018-11-08 17:04:10 I hear you. My husband and I both struggled with that with my postdoc move. Does your insurance provide mental health services? That helped me tremendously. Also, we both take lavender oil. It has actually been pretty rigorously tested. Hang in there; you aren’t alone

3696 2018-11-08 17:02:52 As you approach menopause, you might need less calories to maintain your weight than you used to, so take note of where you can make healthy swaps, such as switching out butter and shortening oils for olive or vegetable oil.
3697 2018-11-08 17:02:50 Keep in mind that both the 5 foolish and the 5 wise had oil in the LAMP at first.  But yes, that flame goes out while they sleep.  But it also goes out (or becomes dim) for the WISE, to a point as well.  When they ALL awaken they minister to the lamp to restore the flame.

3699 2018-11-08 17:02:38 Tea tree oil works well! Witch hazel toner helps + chemical exfoliants with things like aha bha or things with salicylic acid can help to remove the blemishes eventually.

3701 2018-11-08 17:02:34 These are not accidents!  They the captains of these oil rigs that are under sanctions.  When come across a Military ship.  They are most of the time a much bigger ship and they can destroy the smaller military ship on a head on collisions!  This MUST STOP! and I know how-
3702 2018-11-08 17:02:34 How about ending wars for bankers, corporations, and profit?  No wars,  no trauma, no PTSD.  The US has a war economy. Nonstop wars since colonization.  The “Civil War”, Vietnam Police Action, Afghanistan Poppy Seizure, and Iraq Central Bank and Oil Aggression never declared.
3703 2018-11-08 17:02:25 Nah! My workout is hard, and not taking sugar, roti, naan, rice and oil stuff. Only taking boiled vegetables, and some boiled chicken

3744 2018-11-08 16:59:13 Let me confirm from my friend .
3745 2018-11-08 16:59:10 this new coconut oil did me dirty
3746 2018-11-08 16:59:10 I should add, that 1ml of the 1:1 oil will give you the biggest damn grin you can muster. It’s a great way to watch a comedy movie.
3747 2018-11-08 16:59:06 Think about eating. Sometimes, you want to eat more but can't. Wanting is demand, eating is consumption. Consumption does not take movement of oil in and out of inventory into account.

3753 2018-11-08 16:58:28 Yes, I always wonder why say oil sands companies don't ramp up construction in down times to be ready during hot times.  Always seem to be playing catch up when things are hot and more expensive.

3817 2018-11-08 16:52:36 Exfoliate once a week to scrub off dead cells that make skin look dull. When skin is freshly exfoliated, lotion and oil are better absorbed.

3820 2018-11-08 16:52:19 Wrong. Pipelines to ports give us equal footing on international markets.  It may temporarily depress global prices, but not for long and not by much. Also, the US will always buy our oil at discount, but with market exposure, it will be significantly less of a steal for them

Just before the referendum, Sir Ian Wood told us that the Oil was running out.
I've already said Scotland is well on the way to 100% renewables.
This is about the theft of Scotland's Oil.

3860 2018-11-08 16:48:51 Disagree. Even if we stop using oil, we still have the HUGE population increase, and even if we also reduce red meat and take on a vegetarian life, we will increase our consumption of fresh water and farmable soil. Fishing and farming will increase and we will still pollute.

3875 2018-11-08 16:47:34 Sort of. The writer, who always seems to lean to the right, is using a popular current American liberal political term, and trying to make it apply to pols who are in the pocket of multi-national oil companies & big business. Phony journalism.
3876 2018-11-08 16:47:32 Oil and gas companies do pay Royalities. Canadians now own a pipeline that could be providing jobs and long term profits for all of Canada.  These profits would help support Canadians and move us closer to Renewables. What is the purpose of stoping the pipeline now?
3877 2018-11-08 16:47:27 It looks like an abstract oil painting, freaky.
3878 2018-11-08 16:47:27 I did the math and paying for all the shit to change your own oil barely saves money (if it does at all) and what it does save isn’t worth my time.
3879 2018-11-08 16:47:24 It’s important to remember that the area(s) that are going to be welded should be free of any rust, oil, water and paint, or as close to it as possible. If any of this is present, the weld will be weak and not the best looking weld.
3880 2018-11-08 16:47:18 While cooking, I came up with a really detailed and clever design for a kind of horizontal mesh guard for my stove to prevent oil from splattering me.

Then I remembered about aprons.

3882 2018-11-08 16:47:16 Middle Eastern Oil money : Our government take the money, our banks take the money and we the people use their oil everyday of the week yet only Manchester City a football club are in the wrong?
3883 2018-11-08 16:47:11 ...military families and soldiers get paid, federal employees, seniors, Medicaid, SSI, public schools only, ObamaCare!

Who won't get paid: defense contractors, Pentagon, corporate subsidies, security contractors, Oil companies, any company who post profits on Wall Street!!!

3887 2018-11-08 16:46:58 Why is so hard to get oil from nigeria, angola and gas deals from Mozambique and stop doing business outside Africa
3888 2018-11-08 16:46:57 These idiots are fortunate it wasn't in a castle law state.
3889 2018-11-08 16:46:55 Okay so yea I didn’t have any breakouts lmaoooo I was trying it as a new oil 
3890 2018-11-08 16:46:53 olive oil
3891 2018-11-08 16:46:41 They sold out of oil and restocked twice on ocs it was gone next day same with the $10 grinders that cost pennies to make.
3892 2018-11-08 16:46:34 Socially and emotionally retarded? Lack of empathy bordering on sociopathic?

3896 2018-11-08 16:46:11 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
3897 2018-11-08 16:45:52 Wait a minute, should that not be Scotland has enough oil reserves for the UK for 20 years? Where was Cameron hiding that then in 2014?
3898 2018-11-08 16:45:50 These are the right kinds of socialists. 

The ones without empathy. 

So let’s give up our guns and follow them into the totalitarian state. 

Should end well.
3899 2018-11-08 16:45:48 Yeah, but until this bunch they held real olive oil sacrosanct
3900 2018-11-08 16:45:34 Woman pregnant. Abortion?
No way! Life is sacred!
18 years of love & education later:
We need oil. Draft them!
But life is sacred!
Not as sacred as oil!
3901 2018-11-08 16:45:33 You sold at a fair loss because somebody on tv said oil was going down?
3902 2018-11-08 16:45:24 제가 잘모탯서요ㅠ,,,
3903 2018-11-08 16:45:12 It's a thing.   It's a common way to make oil.
Not that I would know anything about that 
3904 2018-11-08 16:45:11 Now the wet.
4 eggs at room temperature and a quick whisk. 
1 cup of oil, I go with canola for baking.
2 - 3 teaspoons of vanilla. 

Next up is the pineapple juice. For this I use crushed pineapple and puree it. 
Add 1/2 cup and whisk it all together.
3905 2018-11-08 16:45:00 Baby oil buat ngapus maskara aja wkwk
3906 2018-11-08 16:44:52 I use tons of garlic gently sweated in oil/butter, a shed-load of spices (not just heat, lots of aromatics like cumin and coriander etc too) add the lentils, then use stock, not water.  It usually comes out ok.
Good luck! 
3907 2018-11-08 16:44:43 Avoid yg wipes sbb possible utk kacau your moisture barrier. Cleansing oil or micellar water so much better :)

3914 2018-11-08 16:44:04 그게 무슨 상관인데오ㅠ (인성
3915 2018-11-08 16:44:03 I'm literally loling trying to remember. We left when my 18yr old was a newborn. I think if I had to do it now I'd probably just use straight up coconut oil. Maybe with a few drops of lavender and patchouli essential oils. It works in Ohio.
3916 2018-11-08 16:43:56 Your basis could be a tea bread, which can be quite simple:

Dried fruit
Self raising flour
Caster sugar
Eggs (or substitute)
Sunflower oil
Nutmeg 
Tea

Leaving you two ingredients to play with!
3917 2018-11-08 16:43:56 soooo y'all know how to fry fish and stuff with some flour season it up and you dip the fish in egg then in the flour right. y'all ever fry that left over egg you was dipping the fish in, in that same fish oil???? shit slapsssssssss
3918 2018-11-08 16:43:55 Tea tree oil & because of that I’m scared to try any other oil on my face
3919 2018-11-08 16:43:44 Was gonna be a smart arse but I accept OIL as a flammable source as I dont know the type of refreshment served?
3920 2018-11-08 16:43:38 oil rustling...
3921 2018-11-08 16:43:35 We have enough oil for 120 years. BBC at the 'Oh woe is Scotland, dependent on London' trope.
3922 2018-11-08 16:43:33 I've been using The Ordinary's squalane oil and I am completely in love, my skin has never felt so moisturized. every year, the moment the seasons change I get a dry patch around my mouth that persists until spring and since I started using this it's GONE
3923 2018-11-08 16:43:31 Massage hair will stimulate sebaceous glands and excrete natural oil to condition your scalp and hair .. but nowt else .. no get clogged pores you would have to not wash your scalp for 50 and a half years ....
3924 2018-11-08 16:43:29 Ah that's a problem. I'll look things up for you but off the top of my head the most I can think of is applying ambisol(sp?) around the gums. It won't help a lot but it may numb you up a little. Maybe pure spearmint or Peppermint oil too. Better than nothing.
3925 2018-11-08 16:43:28 Some of them do.  Their names are Cletus, Jim-Bob, Tammy-Lynn and the one they call "Paw-Paw" and they live in the last trailer on the left, the one with all the Christmas lights on it all year round that smells vaguely of dirty vegetable oil and Sudafed.
3926 2018-11-08 16:43:26 Don’t waste water. Don’t use colours as they are harmful for skin. In Diwali don’t use firecrackers. Next is don’t lit jhalar as it will be wastage of electricity and conserve energy gang will come up. And at last don’t lit diya instead gift that oil to someone needy.

3932 2018-11-08 16:43:06 There is no legal cannabis oil to buy. This is one of the failures of legalization. They still do not offer products people want, therefore people are making those products on their own. 
Butane or alcohol is an organic solvent it works great for making oil, it's common practice
3933 2018-11-08 16:43:03 It's time for these useful idiot econuts to be thrown in jail.
Their actions are destroying Canada's economy and I'm fed up with nuts, bought and paid for by US Democrats who benefit from oil by rail, affecting social programs and jobs of tens of millions of Canadians.

3937 2018-11-08 16:42:50 If you're out of shaving cream, use olive oil. It works just as good, if not better.
3938 2018-11-08 16:42:46 Are these all professional qualifications or are they self proclaimed with coconut oil?
3939 2018-11-08 16:42:42 that's the same kind issue as using it with oil for dipping bread, I think. it's not a nice taste to eat just poured on. and it's very thick and sorta cloudy. after trying that i only ever used it in actual cooking
3940 2018-11-08 16:42:39 Finally oil price rigging in the right direction for us all....down

3953 2018-11-08 16:41:28 Oil is in a FEROCIOUS bear market. All the Permian oil getting to the market and resulting in huge oversupply. Everyone is drilling like mad. Gonna be an interesting YE for our industry
3954 2018-11-08 16:41:13 I highly recommend rose hip oil for your skin I am glowing
3955 2018-11-08 16:41:02 Why it take an hour for an oil change 
3956 2018-11-08 16:41:02 I use coconut oil, olive oil, Shea butter, palm oil, sunflower oil, and of course lye and water.

3962 2018-11-08 16:40:32 For a minute, I thought it was going to be olive oil.

3965 2018-11-08 16:40:08 What a sad, sad commentary on science education in some parts of our country that are beholden to gas and oil interests for funding.
3966 2018-11-08 16:40:08 1) Please provide us with more info on the "perpetual free energy conductor"
2) Which specific event are you referring to in "The survivors of the global cataclysm ensured that changed to oil"?
3) What's a water powered car engine? Who was the inventor who mysteriously died?

3971 2018-11-08 16:39:20 Today I found out you can fit a Vespa into a Mini. 

I also found out you get covered in oil and fuel trying to get it out on your own.
3972 2018-11-08 16:39:16 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
3973 2018-11-08 16:39:03 it's an oil tanker so fairly weak comrade status
3974 2018-11-08 16:38:57 The fundamental problem with all of this is that Trump has created a circus atmosphere in what used to be the hallowed halls of government. At least we used to have decorum. Now we have a snake oil salesman, and we are at the edge of a very deep crevasse. We need to dump him.
3975 2018-11-08 16:38:55 There I stood in Walgreens with a decision to make. "Enriching" lotion for radiant skin  or "Healing" lotion lotion for healthy skin? Vanity or health? Shea Butter or Argan Oil + Vitamin E?
3976 2018-11-08 16:38:53 Oil (at +-65$ bbl) is down again today, down -+ 15 $ from its Oct high => great for oil consumers. At 90Mln barrels a day of ww consumption, 10$ less means almost 1 Bln $ per day or 350 Bln $ per yr of savings.  Cheer up, fill up and enjoy while it lasts.

3980 2018-11-08 16:38:32 What I hear is oil oil oil and exploitive extraction of the planet.
3981 2018-11-08 16:38:22 Elections have consequences. 

So instead of relying on goat raper's and pedophiles, we are becoming independent of foreign oil. Sounds great to me. More American jobs. Less Saudi Arabia and OPEC.
3982 2018-11-08 16:38:15 I need to buy some new Retinol oil

3984 2018-11-08 16:37:59 Anything from 50-75% depending on your selling price, how much oil you use and the fuel you use to do the cooking.
3985 2018-11-08 16:37:58 LOL OIL. Just how many synthetic products, paints and dyes even in his small studio (bedroom?)

3989 2018-11-08 16:37:32 Dearest Mother, 

I have all but squandered my precious supply of lamp oil, as I can not seem to put my newest novel down. Valuable sleep has been lost and I fear my fatigue may put my men in danger. Wish me good tidings and send squirrel oil.

3990 2018-11-08 16:37:26 We need a death by a thousand cuts approach to taking out the fossil fuel companies. If there were thousands of anti oil and gas initiatives on the ballots it would bankrupt them to fight them all.
3991 2018-11-08 16:37:25 Like. Resist

4005 2018-11-08 16:36:22 Oil change is only like $20 why would you ever want to do it yourself
4006 2018-11-08 16:35:57 What are dosages for CBD oil?

4016 2018-11-08 16:35:00 No it probably was to do with cooking oil. What do you think???? 
4017 2018-11-08 16:34:56 @famatiz They don't like Obert Mpofu? I thought these pple were family? Dzevanhu hadzipindirwe Ndichambonotsvaga cooking oil.
4018 2018-11-08 16:34:41 Peaceful Country?
And No there shouldn't be War for Oil.
4019 2018-11-08 16:34:39 Good morning to everyone except for the ppl that over tighten drain plugs and oil filters for no reason at all
4020 2018-11-08 16:34:34 Well spraying it and putting off the light is done so that the room won't be heated up by d bulb, the time you come in to sleep
4021 2018-11-08 16:34:28 Hopefully it starts happening at a few NRA socials soon, instead of schools and bars. See how much they enjoy the blood being spilled then!
4022 2018-11-08 16:34:14 And on that we definitely disagree. When Obama spoke to the nation, I saw and heard a silver-tongued, fork-tongued snake oil salesman.
To be clear, if you liked Obama, that's fine. I don't think you're a bad person.
Let me see if I can find the meme I created pre-election...
4023 2018-11-08 16:34:13 Bet @JoeTramill don't get mad because you left your debit card and like a good friend I memorized it so me and @DoperByDesign can get Bduubs and his oil changed smh @JoeTramill you used be a real one now you fake as hell
4024 2018-11-08 16:34:01 I did that before but it would stick to the pan. it could be the heat or my pan, or the amount of oil I used. then I saw a cooking video telling now to prescramble lol

4028 2018-11-08 16:33:29 How am I gonna a buy a brand new, 2018, car from @Honda and they won’t even let me make an appointment for an oil change. Absolutely ridiculous.
4029 2018-11-08 16:33:19 The Rial just rebounded 40% against the dollar & the Tehran Stock Exchange is at an all time high since the devalued currency has caused a surge in Iran's non oil exports. 300 names ? why not make it 3000 or 3 million LOL Wait for the extensions
4030 2018-11-08 16:33:12 Getting my snow tires put on and an oil change is really just a bulletproof excuse to sit alone in a neighbouring Wendy’s for one glorious, solitary hour. #dadlife #vacation
4031 2018-11-08 16:33:09 How do you speak with all that gun oil in your mouth? Go ahead, fellate another one...
4032 2018-11-08 16:33:07 I find that it really nourishes my skin better than a moisturizer. I usually use a quarter-sized amount as a facial oil and apply to wet skin after cleansing. Sucks it up really well! Hope that helps!
4033 2018-11-08 16:33:00 Dats a ton of oil
4034 2018-11-08 16:32:59 1h30 waiting to have an oil change @FordServiceCA in Toronto. I was told the service takes 30-40min...the guy just got my car now, after 1h30. Why do I book an appointment again?
4035 2018-11-08 16:32:57 Pushing people to research for themselves "kills true critical thought".... 
Hmmm, it's not Q that's sounding like a "snake oil merchant" here, Dr Gorka.
4036 2018-11-08 16:32:54 My point is about the T-90s- a crazy amount of money to spend for an oil dependent country. Education budget next year is still tiny. Water, electricity...all costs billions. This will be the cause, eventually, of a revolution or some other strife. T-90s will be unable to stop it
4037 2018-11-08 16:32:47 Аааа, це просто неймовірна пісня. Саме з неї і почалась моя любов до Fall Out Boy. Точніше, завдяки їй я і дізналася про цей гурт.

4038 2018-11-08 16:32:45 #uprmalaysia2018 Malaysia Response: Sarawak State Deputy AG:0.9% has been mapped as NCR for natives. Sarawak has moratorium on oil palm plantations; rural development high on Sarawak rural priority. Penan unhappiness in Murum Dam has been resolved. @jeraldjoseph2 is this true?
4039 2018-11-08 16:32:44 Do you have funding for oil boilers? We have a number of owner-occupied homes that qualified under eco2t but not installed.
4040 2018-11-08 16:32:42 It doesn't hurt. But CP and oil/mine crews use name brand tools. So free, but nice.
4041 2018-11-08 16:32:32 face oil before sleep #nightroutine
4042 2018-11-08 16:32:28 Y’all.. I used to make fun of oil diffusers but like... I always wake up so nice and easily when there’s one in the room
4043 2018-11-08 16:32:20 I really like the gummies, fwiw. Oil seems to break down really fast and not get the CBD into my system very well.
4044 2018-11-08 16:32:20 ฝันดีนะสุดหล่อ
4045 2018-11-08 16:32:17 Interesting. If you can use oil, you can presumably use cannabutter. Good to know.
4046 2018-11-08 16:32:13 i think the key is to be fast and maybe the heat needs to be higher, otherwise the egg always sticks to the pan no matter how much oil i put. and the egg will become too cooked or burnt (which always happen to me lol)

4050 2018-11-08 16:31:52 Like a place where oil springs up from the ground if you dig and you can fly on a magic carpet?
4051 2018-11-08 16:31:41 Just thought about cooking with literally anything but olive oil and starting laughing my ass off
4052 2018-11-08 16:31:38 I had to that vaseline and baby oil wasn’t working. Ion know what she used but that shit wasn’t trynna let up
4053 2018-11-08 16:31:22 Got to work this morning & my employer tells me, “You seem stressed, pull an oracle card & have some CBD oil” & that’s why I love my job
4054 2018-11-08 16:31:08 I just realized.... I don't have any oil left... fuck
4055 2018-11-08 16:31:08 Kalo boleh ngganya aku kurang tau,

4058 2018-11-08 16:30:41 So your answer is.... stop telling people about it 
4059 2018-11-08 16:30:33 This western oil patch country! I have met no one in this area that would dream of voting liberal! Period he is despised and hated, most openly voice their dislike for him, his cabinet and Ottawa! Secession is a very real and present danger to Canadian unity
4060 2018-11-08 16:30:32 I tried using it like you’d use olive oil with balsamic vinegar. That was a mistake XD but yes you can just use it in regular cooking like frying stuff

It’s brutal what dealerships do to make $.

4082 2018-11-08 16:28:03 Yeah after you get done with it I need to get an oil change
4083 2018-11-08 16:27:55 What no “oil cunt” reference? I’m disappointed
4084 2018-11-08 16:27:48 The running narrative that the center of gravity for USD rez status is its entrenched position in oil contracts. Very cliché; and this just looks like another ground run, against a good defense, in a very long campaign

4087 2018-11-08 16:27:24 Watched @LesleyRiddoch @PhantomPower14 #Nation #Norway film. The oil museum & pride in their engineering prowess is comes from them owning their oil. I live in Aberdeen no one here feels like we own our oil.

4096 2018-11-08 16:26:01 Maggie T is to blame for the state of this country. When you are sitting in gridlock traffic just remember that Maggie wasted  an oil bonanza paying £7 dole money to 3 million whilst spending nothing on Infrastructure. The most short sighted woman in history was Maggie.
4097 2018-11-08 16:25:48 You’re so delusional. You do realise that the exemptions are only temporary until March right?  oil demand will decrease next year and Iranian oil will be driven down closer to zero. And this “Iranian civilisation” you talk about! This regime is not iranian. They are lslamist

4103 2018-11-08 16:25:10 And the government is still spending so much resources on crude oil.
4104 2018-11-08 16:25:06 I cannot codemn one and not the other it makes me a hypocrite. Like you I fill my car up every week I use plastic products from oil. My country has arms deals with the Saudis so why would I then turn around and question the source of the funds or their human rights?

Prof. @engelfilm joined them, capturing the discussion in the film "Who Speaks for Nature?".
4106 2018-11-08 16:24:52 Canada has not missed this boat. Unfortunately there is increasing oil demand on the horizon. Or are the IEA predictions wrong? More renewables are part of the future but with the overall  in energy demand more oil will be needed in the medium term.
4107 2018-11-08 16:24:50 Would CBD oil help, perhaps?? Love to all.

Scotland has MORE OIL than Norway

Now Norway is the wealthiest in Europe.

...Norway isn't in an unequal union!

4135 2018-11-08 16:22:38 It's a damn site cheaper drilling for oil on your land when all the ice has melted. Also the sooner all the existing oilfields dry up the sooner the price will go up. Where's the profit in taking it easy?
4136 2018-11-08 16:22:35 Private ownership of land and ancient resources like oil, plants had feelings all along, no emotional education offered, ableism, no basic human safety net, consciousness-ism, the right to inheritance will be questioned...
4137 2018-11-08 16:22:20 Change occurs through popular will - we need to agree this is a huge problem and pressure the politicians who coddle big oil to make change - as long as they can rely on climate deniers to support them change will not occur

Why can't we benchmark minimum wage on the dollar?

4149 2018-11-08 16:21:19 So what’s your point? The oil companies have been gouging us since the beginning of the recession. It’s not all taxes and it is certainly not all from the carbon tax. Stop obsessing about it! Kenny’s got you running around  that the sky is falling and it’soil companies gouging us

4159 2018-11-08 16:20:57 Crew is the one getting killed on their heavy and light oil differentials while Peyto is getting higher prices across the board. If I wanted a company with a bit of everything I`d rather be in $BTE. Crew`s condensate is around 9% of production, the same liquids weighing of $PEY.

4161 2018-11-08 16:20:54 Those big oil companies know how carburetors should really be designed. But instead, they only allowed engineers and manufacturers to stick with the old design that sprays fuel into the intake manifold instead of the ones that makes the fuel evaporate before combustion.

4163 2018-11-08 16:20:32 Exactly! The reason military corporations, big pharma, big agriculture, oil companies and Wall Street donate to BOTH parties is because it works. It is win/win for THEM no matter who is elected.

4180 2018-11-08 16:19:21 This 'climate plan' is a bait and switch. It's the Libs way of staying in the oil/gas + coal electric power game while the consumer takes the GHG burden. This is Y we see immediate exemptions for the largest emitters, particularly coal power, the worst of all.
4181 2018-11-08 16:19:07 The Quran is the most dangerous book on earth, it is filled with violence beheadings pedophile rape to which radicals and there are plenty of them, literally take this book seriously. They do not intergrate with the west because it is everything they are not. Oil and water.

4185 2018-11-08 16:18:36 So I want to try CB.D oil for my PCOS because I've heard it does wonders for it, but I'm also scared of the possibility of it showing up on a drug screen and me losing my job. :/
4186 2018-11-08 16:18:26 I’m at Pep Boys getting my oil changed and there’s two women (who don’t know each other) gossiping about one’s boyfriend and how trash he is. And honestly I’m here for it

4189 2018-11-08 16:18:15 WRONG, the ninth exemption is Iraq. Whose going to replace Iran's sweet crude ? Canadian oil sands ? LOL Saudi's who are already at full capacity ? These sanctions are a joke. Turkey has vowed to ignore them no matter what.

4198 2018-11-08 16:16:51 This is how we support BTS deep thought. Don't be disrespectful. You don't want to learn single history about their country and ppl. RM always emphasized that 'there is no future for a nation that forgot history'. You should've known what that means. Study first or be humble.
4199 2018-11-08 16:16:49 @Acosta how are you and @cnn not suing these snake oil peddlers, @realDonaldTrump and @PressSec for #libel and/or defamation.  All their lies about fake news and enemies of the people, now a (poorly) doctored video to justify revoking credentials? Certainly this is slander!

4203 2018-11-08 16:16:34 I love you more! And don’t forget it also starts with your face wash so just make sure you use an oil free one. + your skin is over producing oil because you’re not moisturizing enough so don’t forget to moisturize every morning and night

4206 2018-11-08 16:16:28 Some guy really just tweeted "it's impossible to change your oil without a professional". Isn't this the same stuff that y'all talk shit about women for not knowing 
4207 2018-11-08 16:16:25 Only when the oil runs out
4208 2018-11-08 16:16:23 Reminds me of when I showed my dad the first item on the ingredient label of his Kraft's "olive oil" mayonnaise was soybean oil
4209 2018-11-08 16:16:21 While october oil imports are up 32% yoy.
4210 2018-11-08 16:16:21 It's gets boring hearing it all the time

I'm more impressed when they talk about my vast knowledge of the oil and gas industry
4211 2018-11-08 16:16:12 Only those walking in the spirit. The oil is burnt by the Holy Spirit. Without him it's empty, it doesn't burn.

The shadow of this is the feast of dedication. Hanukkah.

4215 2018-11-08 16:15:53 This is not true. As someone who has seen some of the strict oilfield cleanup process that is completed on wells that no longer produce I ask how oil companies like #CNRL exist if cleanup costs so much more than the money to be made.
4216 2018-11-08 16:15:48 It was evident China meant ill for the South China Sea from the time they began to construct the artificial islands. This is one of the key shipping lanes for trade in the world, more than 30% of the worlds oil shipments pass thru. Every nation has an interest in keeping it free

4221 2018-11-08 16:15:01 that whale oil was a key component of automotive transmission fluid until 1972; over 30 million pounds was used annually until its use was outlawed, after which transmission failures rose eight-fold

4224 2018-11-08 16:14:53 CEO of Canary at today’s #NMenergy event, “People are getting a $200k/year job, with a $75k skill set because oil is $61/barrel. They need to build their budget and choices off the $75k to prepare for the market cycle.”

Sounds like a great analogy for our N.M. budget surplus.
4225 2018-11-08 16:14:41 Crude is sliding everyday! Good news for oil marketing companies and economy as a whole. As we speak crude trades at $71.39. will it go below $70 tonight? Let's see how it pans out. #Brentcrude #oilmarketing #bpcl #hpcl #ioc
4226 2018-11-08 16:13:56 You're consistently funny, but I feel like this tweet deserves to be turned into an oil painting.
4227 2018-11-08 16:13:51 I make the sane point often... But I do want "green" tech to replace oil
4228 2018-11-08 16:13:47 Cole went to her cabinets, pulling out any seasonings they would need.

"Do ya use oil to cook steaks, or butter?" she asked.
4229 2018-11-08 16:13:47 I mean he knows how to catch a baseball right?  One would think he could play a position called catching...just start making him cheesesteaks done in coconut oil and he’ll be good to go brotha!!!!
4230 2018-11-08 16:13:46 Most of sweets/namkeen of branded companies are made Palm oil which is harmful for health. Future of our children is in danger @narendramodi
@PMOIndia  is hopefully take urgent action.
4231 2018-11-08 16:13:41 Not yet. Wait till March, but it wont be a pleasant situation. We be ok though. Few bags of daal, 25kg bag of potatoes bag of onion some oil rice, aata etc  I feel sorry for the ones who eat microwave food and never cook for themselves. They will be hit the hardest.

String lights always make me smile because they remind me of holidays so even when it’s dark early those are a nice/cheery reminder

Can it fly when it's raining?
When was the last time it temperature went high (over heating)?

While the Extreme Bond Primer can be applied to wood, we do offer other products such as our Multi-Purpose Oil based primer or the Premium Wall & Wood that would be ideal for the bare crown molding. Once the primer is applied you can then topcoat with a semi-gloss. Thanks!

4280 2018-11-08 16:09:02 Why not ask WESTMINSTER what they can do about it seeing they have 75% economic powers, nearly half our revenue (40%) & 92% of Scotland's oil money? THEY HOLD MOST OF THE CARDS in the Scottish political game
4281 2018-11-08 16:08:49 Probably would have negotiated better terms within the European Union for instance EFTA

Negotiations are the key to success which Westminster is not able to do

WM could have opted for the Oil social welfare fund, it didn't...opted out the schengen agreement/vital etc
4282 2018-11-08 16:08:35 sana oil hahahah
4283 2018-11-08 16:08:35 Is the long term step to move towards real bio based ie from plant material plastics...that will break down completely naturally and are not from an oil base...

4286 2018-11-08 16:08:23 Raising the minimum wage stimulates the economy in the long term, people who have more disposable income tend to spend it on products they wouldn’t have bought without the raise such as a car. Btw gas prices have risen because of the gas tax and monopolies on crude oil in Mid E.
4287 2018-11-08 16:08:12 Transmission lines are similar to oil pipelines in many ways. Both are vessels that allow for connection between points of production and consumption.

4295 2018-11-08 16:07:38 Meanwhile, and this is confusing, West Texas Intermediate has dropped 20 percent over the past month.  At a time when Trump is putting sanctions on Iranian oil. Normally this would send oil to $100. But everyone is pumping like crazy and global demand is soft.

4299 2018-11-08 16:07:25 Greetings, Sir. All oils are in 4 oz glass bottles. No foreseeable plans to put oils in larger bottles. The only exception is Yoni Wash (8 oz glass bottle) and Mouth Swishing Oil (returning soon). Baobab Oil is an excellent oil. Not many people know about it.
4300 2018-11-08 16:07:17 What happened to these projects under PDP 
- Lagos - Ibadan express, after 16years in power and so much earning from crude oil sales.
_ No refineries producing when PDP left power...
_ East-West road not completed 
_ Mambila Hydra Power etc etc....
4301 2018-11-08 16:07:05 I do smoothies but with less fruit and more greens and, yes, good fats in moderation...almond butter, avocado and coconut oil. Too much sugars from fruit causes bloat and irritated gut for me. Personal preference that’s all. Read that article when you get a chance.

4436 2018-11-08 15:54:38 How do we prepare our extra Vial of Oil like the 5 Wise Virgins of Matt 25? First, read, study, and meditate on the Word of God. The filling of this vial is NOT an immediate thing. It takes time. You must "purchase it" by buying Gold refined by fire from GOD through His Spirit.
4437 2018-11-08 15:54:36 #Oil #lightcrudeoil  Tant qu'on reste au dessus des 57.8-59 ça reste ok coté hausse mais je pense qu'il sera très difficile de ne pas retomber sur les 53. Et même si l'Opep raréfie la production => une spéculation MT,le changement de paradigme a lieu et continuera. A suivre...
4438 2018-11-08 15:54:35 Went to Forsyth and back twice and tank still on full  s/o to that oil change and filter
4439 2018-11-08 15:54:14 OPEC needs to announce an Oil buyback soon, amirite!?
4440 2018-11-08 15:53:58 He’s just calling you out for the populist snake oil charlatan you are, fooled a load of Gammon closet racists telling the poor souls we could have the exact same benefits as being a member, never mind FBI will be coming for you soon

4448 2018-11-08 15:53:35 Your breath smells like oil and ass cheeks now
4449 2018-11-08 15:53:28 Yeah I thought it sounded high. Lol oh well, the oil change was “free” so I guess it cancels out.

4451 2018-11-08 15:52:45 There's a trick to it Coach...
Nuke 'em first for like 2 min. Then slice in half, drizzle olive oil, garlic, sea salt and throw em under a broiler. Balsamic dressing works too.

There's a gas in them that microwaving then broiling gets out.

4455 2018-11-08 15:51:34 After the @HouseDemocrats win nationally, and the @coloradodems retaking of the state Senate, I’m reminded of a #Colorado bumper sticker I saw when we moved here 30 years ago: “Please Lord, just give us one more oil boom. We promise not to piss it away this time.”
4456 2018-11-08 15:51:32 How disrespectful is that to the innocent people who are murdered?!
4457 2018-11-08 15:51:27 Also, oil trending down is definitely not going to help
4458 2018-11-08 15:51:18 Pork ribs. Cabbage. Make layers with cabbage leaves (break each's spine), slip the ribs in between, until the pot is full. Add some olive oil, salt and pepper to taste. Put the lid on, cook for 3-5 hours on the lowest fire possible, until the cabbage is a mushy mess. Enjoy.

4463 2018-11-08 15:50:51 Crude oil 2: Over supply. First leg lower of bear market may encourage stock traders that lower costs to assist Econ. But overtime or within a late leg of bear market, sentiment likely to swing toward soft demand of oil =soft Econ. #crudeoil
4464 2018-11-08 15:50:41 Clove oil.
4465 2018-11-08 15:50:25 High gas composition artificially dilutes “low cost producer” metrics. Comparing Anything/BOE not fair when comparing gas weighted vs oil weighted names.
4466 2018-11-08 15:50:15 Can he name one anti oil & gas law passed? Alternative energy development is necessary for the inevitable down market and climate change.

4477 2018-11-08 15:49:13 The answer is simple:  Quit splashing it all over the news.  Quit giving the life details of the shooter, Quit reading any manifestos, Quit making it a competition for the next shooter.  On the nightly news, announce the shooting, and then move on to next story.  @FoxNews

4504 2018-11-08 15:45:48 The US and also the EU and Canada, sanction individuals accused of corruption. The US is still buying Venezuelan oil as you tweet.
4505 2018-11-08 15:45:45 Each ONGC employee enjoys many benefits even though they deserve none. ONGC simply earns more because it deals with oil and natural gas and not because of their skills or intelligence.
Do you think those corrupt employees deserve foreign tours and expeditions on taxpayer's money?
4506 2018-11-08 15:45:42 My gut feel goes, counter would be "less oil import bills" by liberandus.

So many more appropriate uses of "The" for your cover.
4509 2018-11-08 15:45:39 Sponsored by big oil U-S of A. They need our oil and love it on the cheap. Canadians need to wake up, pipelines should have been built years ago and should be built now.

4514 2018-11-08 15:44:39 Okay so fry it in olive oil, coconut oil, peanut oil etc and instead of using breadcrumbs use crushed porkrinds. All good fats.
4515 2018-11-08 15:44:38 Good Morning Everyone! Is there a massage therapist, spa or yoga studio that you think could do very well having CBD Oil Products in their practice? If you do let me know and we can talk more! #CBDOIL #Massage #Spa
4516 2018-11-08 15:44:35 Thank you. Now if we could just clear the path for hemp production, we could replace oil.

4518 2018-11-08 15:44:28 A draft of the new code is proposing that state-owned oil producer Societe Des Petroles Du Senegal, also known as Petrosen, take a stake of between 10 percent and 30 percent in operational fields and a carried interest of the same size when projects are being developed.

4522 2018-11-08 15:43:56 God won’t let global warming happen or earthquakes “caused” by oil companies. God wants us to use the oil he put in the ground for us!!

4527 2018-11-08 15:43:39 Have you tried a sip of apple cider vinegar? Works great to stop spasms. Also tonic water if it has quinine. Lavender oil rubbed on affected area also reported to be good. 
I hope you get some relief!

4533 2018-11-08 15:43:10 yes.  Most arent going to bother, or like the church lady, say "you be the judge" as if the young girl didn't try to grab the mic:  /-\ Apparently, Russia is buying Iran oil.  if so, this violates US sanctions, a deliberate provocation--
4534 2018-11-08 15:43:09 War is to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th; the pillar that supports the global economy.

4537 2018-11-08 15:42:47 LT its not that I don't think the Oil need help on the wing or RD but its what does Chia give up and how old/how much of a hit comes back. My fear is JP is moved and he figures it out and scores 30 per season for the next 10 years.
4538 2018-11-08 15:42:44 Senegal’s existing oil code regulations are two decades old and were adopted when the nation wanted to attract investment for largely untested resources.

4738 2018-11-08 15:26:15 Sorry, I rarely visit M&S but I might make the effort if I knew there were palm oil free products to try. Too busy to go in and look at all the boxes on the off chance. I'm very surprised you don't know given the consumer concern around this issue. Obvious even on this thread.
4739 2018-11-08 15:26:11 Our only issues the people of Iraq? We can’t just rid them of their homelands that’s why the USA is in a pickle, so they’d prefer to just take the oil and leave the Iraqis to their dry land.

4750 2018-11-08 15:25:05 Seriously, the last two R prez's have been a failed casino owner and a failed oil businessman. These are two industries that are basically impossible to fail at, and they made not one, but two men who apparently couldn't succeed at breeding rabbits fucking president.

4752 2018-11-08 15:25:04 On the 2018 election cycle they spent $73,286,509 not including dark money. On lobbying in 2018 they spent $99,341,774 so far with Exxon #1.
And they receive 27 billion a year in subsidies, 15 billion for fiscal support for domestic oil & gas production & 12 billion in tax breaks
4753 2018-11-08 15:24:34 Why does "more diversified energy sector" always tend to mean more oil & gas development?

4772 2018-11-08 15:22:51 8am appointment for an oil change at @CogginToyotaAVE. It’s 10:20am. Granted we added a couple filter changes & a tire rotation, but 2 1/2 hours? This is why I said no to your extra “recommended services.” No better way to spend my morning...

4799 2018-11-08 15:20:42 I’ve said for years that there’s no reason for oil to be high. Whenever it is there’s manipulation going on. I don’t care if a producer goes offline oil has been bottlenecked since 2013 $WTI

4810 2018-11-08 15:19:40 I like the line that it doesn’t really matter whether they cheated anyway, let’s just all enjoy the lovely oil money. I’m paraphrasing here, but that’s about the size of it.

4836 2018-11-08 15:18:08 Congrats to IOL, great work, this will help

However let’s be crystal clear, our oil industry is far from robust.

“When’s the best time to build things? When no one else is building them because we will have the highest quality trades,”
4837 2018-11-08 15:17:57 He is a very opportunistic politician who has no plan. Alberta is in great shape considering the oil failure of 2014, @RachelNotley is a real leader, Kenny is simply another Harper puppet supported by the grossly uninformed.

I'm honestly scrambling for any other options because I don't know what else to do at this point. They've never been this bad.
4844 2018-11-08 15:17:39 Bio oil hehee
4845 2018-11-08 15:17:11 Totally agreed. And this is coming from a BC resident who doesn’t rely on the oil industry for a job, I just can’t help but feel like it would cost less to truly commit to investing in new energy and training
4846 2018-11-08 15:17:10 Right!? That's why we offer capsules for people who may not like the taste of oreganol oil! Check us out :)

4859 2018-11-08 15:15:48 Previous gov strive to reduce reliant on oil. New gov heavily dependent on oil. Impose special div & hoping oil price to increase more. This policy is moving economy backward.

4871 2018-11-08 15:13:53 Makes sense. My first inclination was to mix cinnamon essential oil into some water or vinegar and spray it up.
4872 2018-11-08 15:13:50 What kind of beard oil do you use?

4877 2018-11-08 15:13:37 He was nice to Indian people in spite of us having a leftist ungrateful Sudhra as the PM who backstabbed the Hindus.  He is a duper and a Veshadhari.  Buddhu and him compete with each other to pose as Hindu zealots! Both are cow slaughters, Trump let India to buy oil from Iran.

4890 2018-11-08 15:12:54 OIL 1H "dead cat bounce" off 60.84 LOD. This move most likely completes 1D e wave, 5th wave lower. Time will tell. WATCH UWT ?
4891 2018-11-08 15:12:42 I have not felt comfortable talking about it but I been freaked the fuck out for the last few months. I was officially declared "disabled" due to my injuries in August and before that had just been walking around this bitch, in pain, but like 'eh, CBD oil will take care of it'.
4892 2018-11-08 15:12:41 Why tf my oil change so expensive 
4893 2018-11-08 15:12:34 헉!!!!++
4894 2018-11-08 15:12:28 I have a friend who inherited a tiny plot of land from her mother that she kept for decades. It had oil on it but could not be drilled. She lived in constant financial hardship. Just Starting drilling. I hope & pray for her financial blessings.

4911 2018-11-08 15:10:08 Understandable but the option meanwhile is limited. We're too dependant of oil to simply go cold turkey as of yet. It will take some times to transition to cleaner energies and this is even more complicated  by the never-ending idiocies from the Conservatives political dinosaurs.

4916 2018-11-08 15:09:46 The only people who agree with your comment, are those who sell the oil.  There is no scientific proof that CBD oil does ANYTHING for your hair.  Again, you can find positive reviews about its affect on hair from people who SELL it for hair.  It’s a scam.
4917 2018-11-08 15:09:39 Or skip the oil and go right to the source by selling snakes.

4927 2018-11-08 15:08:19 i wasn't questioning the market and/or the size, rather the actual benefits. CBD drinks is like selling snake oil, no real benefits but it sells because it sounds good.

4939 2018-11-08 15:06:42 Yup, and they use that snake oil to keep them voting democrat. While dems, progressives, and I-feminists harp on white people about their privilege, etc. Not sure why Dems are surprised about this...
4940 2018-11-08 15:06:41 It’s always shakes isn’t it? Unless it’s literal snake oil
4941 2018-11-08 15:06:36 I'm worried that kids who play #RDR2 are gonna start smoking cigars and slamming Kentucky Bourbon & Snake Oil in an effort to buff their Dead Eye stat. Take it from me, kids: the only way to do that in real life is by eating your veggies & doing your homework.
4942 2018-11-08 15:06:31 I started putting butter in my coffee about two months ago, right after I retired from the being assistant superintendent to be a stay at home dad. Been putting coconut oil in coffee for 3 years after you posted about it
4943 2018-11-08 15:06:31 I make toothpaste with coconut oil, baking soda and peppermint essential  oil. I put it in an small travel size container. Regular toothpaste starts to taste sickly sweet if you do this for awhile but my dentist always marvels at my teeth.

4961 2018-11-08 15:05:03 True, there guys feel too entitled. Instead of burning the midnight oil thinking of how to lift the standards of living of their constituents, they are busy demanding 'better' food.
4962 2018-11-08 15:04:53 I must admit I don't use olive oil much anymore because its too hard to tell if its real or  not. Basically if you can adulterate something to make more profit, generally best to assume someone did.
4963 2018-11-08 15:04:53 I want to rub cbd oil all over leighton so maybe he will stop being a pain in my ass. & if that doesn’t work, I need some for myself so I can chill tf out. So HMU thnx

5011 2018-11-08 14:58:44 Someone give me the energy to get off the couch. Have to get the oil changed in the Jeep before a long drive tomorrow and getting the kids ready sounds like the worst possible thing to do today. Is is frowned upon to take them in their pajamas?

5013 2018-11-08 14:58:10 Our oil ebbs and flows to coincide with how high up the agenda Independence is, you'll be stunned at how it disappears when the Indy campaign starts for real.
5014 2018-11-08 14:57:58 $xop that looked like a blowoff top yest 38.2, trend reversing as oil will keep dropping. Cramer calling for oil 40 handle. He nailed oil 42.5 last year. Saudis cant stop weekly US crude builds #OOTT
5015 2018-11-08 14:57:56 I don’t care where you sit politically but please stop saying the Alberta & Canadian Oil & Gas industry are better with these provincial & federal governments. You lie like Kenney. Canadian Oil companies continue to leave & foreign companies have already left.
5016 2018-11-08 14:57:40 Just heard an economist say that the US is the top oil producing country in the world, that Saudi Arabia has depleted half of their known oil. Meanwhile we have depleted half of 1% of the oil in North Dakota. Interesting.

5022 2018-11-08 14:57:17 If oil goes to $40 it wouldn't stay there for long. Not sustainable.
5023 2018-11-08 14:57:10 Part of the US/Russia enmity is feigned.
Namely they have common interest and deep cooperation in oil&gas, defence & aero-space industries.

IRI should be careful not to be the stupid puppet in these games...

5049 2018-11-08 14:54:12 Dont u see a pattern in their campaign..first they said SOU is fully funded by GOI. When it was revealed that it was a Gujarat funded project, they diverted the attention to CSR funds of oil companies!

5052 2018-11-08 14:53:45 Then we have other food items people are wishfully ignorant about use of oil in them. Ice creams, butter spread, cake etc..
5053 2018-11-08 14:53:37 Weed won’t be nearly as expensive as it would be now. Would be taxed and regulated and Texas would see a huge boom in the economy, a constant unlike the oil industry.

5055 2018-11-08 14:53:35 Of course, some people have been paid secretly to radicalise Muslims and give Islam a bad name.

The reasons for this are many and varied, not least because there is much oil and resources in Muslim lands.

For some it pays to play the world off against Islam and Muslims.
5056 2018-11-08 14:53:33 Oil prices fell for an eighth straight session yesterday—the longest losing streak since July 2014—after a report showed U.S. crude-oil inventories rose for a seventh straight week and U.S. oil production soared.

5059 2018-11-08 14:53:16 Oil in "ferocious bear market"... @jimcramer makes case that prices could fall in to the $40s. With new infrastructure coming online (pipes & ports) could lead to EVEN more supply getting to market.

5134 2018-11-08 14:45:43 That’s great it’s one of the safest and richest country in the world and they invested in multinational companies so in time of crisis they don’t only depend on gas and oil 
5135 2018-11-08 14:45:40 I notice in the headlines the crisis does not mention Socialism or the fact that many idiots want to enact a failed ideology in the United States.  They have a lot of oil and the country should be a utopia according to liberals.
5136 2018-11-08 14:45:39 “Starve the Empire that’s Starving US” should be a core Liberal goal. One that drives all the others. Fuck oil. Fuck war. What People want is health care and living wages

But post-Vietnam, much of the left/center-left has lost its way on that issue.

5146 2018-11-08 14:44:56 Based partly on what they said to me/elsewhere, the prize for O&G is pre-empting regulation as the CLC plan does and a coal-to-gas shift, so presumably they won't support a price that either doesn't slash regulations or that gets high enough to cut into oil and gas.

5150 2018-11-08 14:44:46 You think the oil industry is expensive to taxpayers now, just wait in the future as we'll be left with an even more expensive toxic mess, polluted soil and water and land unfit for any real use! Sticking to old polluting waste is utter nonsense, green tech is the future!
5151 2018-11-08 14:44:06 English oil apparently. It's where it ends up.
5152 2018-11-08 14:43:57 โมโหที่ทำอะไรไม่ได้เลยย

5154 2018-11-08 14:43:44 Leave it to the "socialist" democrats to fall in line behind a slick-talking snake oil salesman who has a $20bil family fortune. The leftists are the party of the uber rich and some major league hypocrites- No matter which of these liars rises out of the Dem dung heap in 2020!
5155 2018-11-08 14:43:36 This morning I finished packing for this weekend, rolled our road joints, got an oil change, went to the bank, I'm grabbing Tim Hotton's and now off to the DMV!
5156 2018-11-08 14:43:31 Coconut oil is good too. IMO, saturated fats are probably the best for cooking cuz they're the most stable. They don't oxidize and have relatively high smoke points.
5157 2018-11-08 14:43:29 Crude oil drops for 9th straight day!!
5158 2018-11-08 14:43:26 ***#OIl: #WTI is now entering in bear market (-20% from the highs of early October) and it can close the ninth straight negative session (record since July 2014, before collapsing)***
5159 2018-11-08 14:43:22 I feel like every time we order a big item from @Lowes something gets messed up.  This time we bought a new snowblower and oil spilled all over the back of my SUV! They said they'd pay for cleaning but now I'm wasting my time trying to find how much and where to take it

5161 2018-11-08 14:43:16 It should melt in your hands at room temp, do it in the cold.  I collect the smooth pouring fine sand of <120ų >45ų either into silicone jars to jeep as sifted whole heads, or I put in a parchment paper bindle to hand press at body.  It would just turn to oil on your bare skin.

5170 2018-11-08 14:42:23 It was absolutely ridiculous in Colorado. The measure would only move the wells a half a mile away from cities and schools and yet people though it was the end of the world for oil jobs. Billboards on cars, planes carrying banners, non stop radio adds. Lttle disheartening

5175 2018-11-08 14:42:04 Rapeseed oil is a seed oil. I stay away from all seed oils. Use ghee or lard for high heat if you don't want it to smoke.

I make my own ghee. It's very easy to do.
5176 2018-11-08 14:41:52 I never knew the desire to punch someone could be so strong

5184 2018-11-08 14:41:04 This is better investment than continue to pour $5m forex per month into these lazy profiteering industries. Next year after soya been harvest, there should be zero allocation for edible oil. Tengai ma medicines instead PSE
5185 2018-11-08 14:41:02 So where do they plan to sell this oil?
5186 2018-11-08 14:40:59 Jesus. Oil has gotten its teeth kicked in. $USO $BNO
5187 2018-11-08 14:40:37 If big oil is willing to spend that much on a single state, just imagine how much they are spending to smear Elon Musk and Tesla.

5191 2018-11-08 14:40:19 Most of them think Nigeria started existing in 2015. PMB made loads of promises thinking there are loads of money in the treasury to make all these things happen. But Baba did not know that, almost all the oil revenues was squandered away from budget allocation.

Yes, I realize the #RepublicanParty just read this and said "We'll get it done."
5197 2018-11-08 14:39:56 Then allow us to support our stupidity in peace na
5198 2018-11-08 14:39:54 Cramer just called for oil to possible 40 handle. He nailed 42.5 oil last summer.

5200 2018-11-08 14:39:45 It didn’t have to be this way. Canada could have, for example, borrowed a page from Norway, which has both a stiff carbon tax and a huge offshore oil industry. “Canada can be both an economic and an environmental leader,” Mitchelmore, the president of Shell Canada
5201 2018-11-08 14:39:35 Trump has done 1000 times better than anything Obama even thought about doing. But he sure was smooth talker. Most would call that snake oil salesman.

5211 2018-11-08 14:38:58 .@SCClemons kicks off the discussion by asking if an oil company can find a pathway to social good?

5212 2018-11-08 14:38:58 #WomenMPsOfTheWorld

Amazing advice from the Norwegian representative highlighting the importance of affordable childcare as 'Men get children too'. 

Also notes the importance of embracing women in the workplace, as it is not oil that had made Norway rich, but the 'She-economy'.
5213 2018-11-08 14:38:56 It's interesting how all areas of knowledge and science are pretty much uncontroversial except when it challenges big oil making lots of money.
5214 2018-11-08 14:38:54 Ach I know. Too expensive to extract. Oil companies investing for the hell of it

5226 2018-11-08 14:38:01 I’ve been using drunk elephant protini moisturizer and herbivore prism oil at night. For my cleanser I use the farmacy clean bee gel cleanser from Sephora. Loving them
5227 2018-11-08 14:38:00 Whatever atleast am not supporting stupidity
5228 2018-11-08 14:37:59 Another thing to try is to avoid using eye creams and concealer too close to the eyes as the oils from the products break down the mascara making it run. You could also apply a tiny amount of loose powder with a fluffy brush carefully under the eyes to help absorb oil.
5229 2018-11-08 14:37:58 Their misleading claims are that we would have been better off economically staying out of EEC in 1973 and EEA in 1990’s. It’s snake oil. Nothing to do with arguments about austerity, food banks, unregulated capitalism etc

5237 2018-11-08 14:37:23 The problem with the oil metaphor is they're not taxed in a way envisioned by the DST. There is a severance tax for extraction, and profits get sourced like any other biz. The DST is a severance tax.
5238 2018-11-08 14:37:20 China's crude oil imports surged 31.5% year on year to 9.65 million b/d in October, preliminary data from the General Administration of Customs showed Thursday. - @PlattsOil #OOTT #China #crude

5245 2018-11-08 14:36:31 Do u consider how much crude oil is being sold at the intl market? Or u think Nigeria will just explore and start refining? Don't u know Nigeria itself much buy the crude oil from nnpc?
5246 2018-11-08 14:36:23 You're not wrong, that's exactly what most idiotic Leave voters think, too.

I've had conversations with people who think we grow all our own food, that we have oil fields in the UK, and that we have a million young students just itching to become doctors.

5274 2018-11-08 14:33:48 I totally agree with you and I think America really on the way to mass suicide by power of money from oil, drugs and guns. 
I am unable to imagine how America will be great again in future and only seeing the fallout.

5280 2018-11-08 14:32:36 You only go all in when you have the assets to handle the loss and stay afloat after. Or you are really down and out and have no choice but to risk it all. The Oil are neither of those things, thus should not "go all in". This team's time to win will be 2-4 years from now IMO.

5293 2018-11-08 14:31:16 That doesn’t mean that it’s a myth? Fuck those people. Our constant drilling for oil is killing us. How does a louisianian not agree! Look at our ecosystem in Louisiana. Look at the current oil spill in the gulf that is becoming the worst of all time and no one even knows
5294 2018-11-08 14:31:13 Anyone got experience of a modern oil filled electric radiator?
5295 2018-11-08 14:31:12 Why did the navy ask for it? Why did the navy wanted this System onboard? I guess not to intercept Anti-Ship Missiles & btw Turkey "Bora missiles" & Hezbollah "Fajr missile" have those missiles. You don't need anti ship missile to hit the oil field. It's an insane scenario o/c.

5301 2018-11-08 14:30:25 "FREE"   advice for your health ! Take Flax seed oil everyday because it   has more omega 3's than omega 6's.  Omega 3's  inhibit inflammation,    whereas omega 6's increase inflammation.  Fish and fish oils contain   more omega 3's but they may also contain mercury or radiation.

5312 2018-11-08 14:29:29 it is real but the problem is it is so deep that even the hardest metal cannot penetrate it longer and because of that it is more expensive than extracting oil and Gas.

5435 2018-11-08 14:17:57 We’re at this place in life right now, that we buy lemon essential oil to destinkify our laundry that we forgot to finish and have rewashed 6 times...it’s a great remedy to forgetting to finish your laundry...

5437 2018-11-08 14:17:54 Trying out essential oils for a still sick baby for the first time...this is my experience thus far:
1) open package, want to smell all the oils. Can’t open one. Force a bottle open because I’m a caveman.
2) Proceed to slosh Eucalyptus oil all over me...
5438 2018-11-08 14:17:51 A Snake Oil Merchant is just that... "a merchant". #QAnon sells nothing. There are no shirts, hats, or even name recognition to market. Maybe Q sells disinformation? Nope. That checks out too #RedOctober All Q really does is tell us to support the president, vote, meme, and pray
5439 2018-11-08 14:17:45 And what happened to the oil tanker?
5440 2018-11-08 14:17:45 Any nice moisturizer mixed with Bio oil. Bio oil makes all the difference. You'll totally love the feel.

I've only tried this with E45 and Aveeno (both nice moisturizers for dry skin).
5441 2018-11-08 14:17:38 I just can’t cope with the taste or texture of the oil or the capsules lol, changing brands wouldn’t make a difference. But I hope I can make it work too, I’m trying to 
5442 2018-11-08 14:17:34 I assume a lot of the onus must be on manufacturers to come up with alternative packaging. Yoghurt, sauces, pre-cooked rice, margarine - just wander the aisles to see what's in plastic. I can only assume it'll still end up incinerated as fuel for energy, as it's oil based.

5470 2018-11-08 14:14:45 It is interesting discussing the use of medical cannabis and CBD oil, so many antiquated notions by fossils my age, but I suggest it would be quite different if one see's the positive benefits of CBD with loved ones dealing with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

More than money.
5471 2018-11-08 14:14:42 Yup, but at this point I expect that bond with doggo will be strong and will last the coal, oil and nuclear eras. :)

5480 2018-11-08 14:13:45 Dem’s “failure to draw attention” is the curtain behind which lies donations and talking points from the oil and gas industry and corruption/revolving doors in state and federal agencies. Eg state offices of mineral resources tasked with promoting oil, gas, and coal extraction.

5492 2018-11-08 14:12:54 Conservatives handed Frudeau a surplus that was verified by Fiscal Monitor reports showing growing surpluses. Now Frudeau is so happy, he likes to give it away to other countries and loser oil company deals. When economic waters get rough, as they are turning now, it's showtime
5493 2018-11-08 14:12:45 Right, the WA state policy was not a good test for whether oil majors will support a carbon tax. I suspect BP won't fight a national proposal like CLC's.
5494 2018-11-08 14:12:38 Despite the crude oil beat down and spreads blowing out (maybe index roll), I'm betting we rally back into the 63s (Z) next week into opex.
5495 2018-11-08 14:12:38 If is true why all our government decides to fucos on crude oil can't they try at least try to maximize it

5498 2018-11-08 14:12:26 It doesn't worry me. The bottle sits on the kitchen windowsill. Says more about what we call 'room temperature' in our house oop North!! It's the same phenomenon as olive oil, I assume, which goes cloudy in a fridge, then clears if warmed slightly. #Ecover

5513 2018-11-08 14:10:58 What a POWERFUL conclusion to our final day of the Haiti Pastors Conference!  Worship, drama, preaching, and concluded with an OIL ANOINTING SERVICE.  Every person was anointed with oil multiple times.  Every team member participated with fervor.
5514 2018-11-08 14:10:55 And running out of oil.
5515 2018-11-08 14:10:48 CPSEs ONGC, HPCL, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, IOC and Oil India Limited had together contributed Rs 146.83 crore (ONGC Rs 50 crore, IOCL Rs 21.83 crore, BPCL, HPCL, OIL Rs 25 crore each) in 2016-17.
147 crore is not a small contribution. Any contribution in 2017-18?.
5516 2018-11-08 14:10:44 Ever since oil was discovered it has been going to run out in 20 years. We are now 40+ years into the first 20 years and yet there is still 20 years worth left.
Either we have self-refilling oil wells or someone is lying

5545 2018-11-08 14:07:40 Sebastian Gorka you are a snake oil salesmen as well. You got booted immediately by General Kelly. I’ve seen LCPL’s in the USMC with more applicable military knowledge then you. You’ve never been close to combat you Con Artist

You would invade even one of your closest allies, Norway, in the blink of an eye if we stopped producing oil.

As would Russia.
And the EU.
And China.
All of you are like rabid dogs thirsting for oil.

5609 2018-11-08 14:00:35 He’s admitted nothing of the kind. I’m thinking along the lines of his destroying Isis, stopping Syria from gassing their own ppl, strengthening nato against their will, more sanctions on Russia,strengthening our oil and nat gas exports to the EU (open competition with Russia),
5610 2018-11-08 14:00:34 It seems to.  Trying to get oil from land it’s just stupid, no thought for the future generations, for the wildlife, environment or the food we eat.  Haven’t we done enough damage with plastics?
5611 2018-11-08 14:00:33 It would have been better to at least have 5 oil workers or 5 oil executives on the cover than these idiots .. The last time they  had to work at something or make a living was never .  Just posers who stand for nothing !!

Like we did in Vz?  Or even Alaska, that pays $8k to a family of 4 from oil revenue. I thought Palin hated Socialism?

5695 2018-11-08 13:52:13 I've been using coconut milk based or argan oil based conditioners (right now trying out Ultimate Blends Argan Oil and Almond one) and leave a little bit in my hair after I've showered hope this helps :)
5696 2018-11-08 13:52:13 Tipping point? The Oil price decides what the tipping point is and always will.
5697 2018-11-08 13:52:11 OIL: Oil rose, recovering modestly from this week's three-week lows, after record Chinese crude imports soothed some concern that demand in the world's largest commodity buyer may be flagging just as global supply is rising
5698 2018-11-08 13:52:07 #cad sometimes the market misses something off the radar - net cash after tiny debt approx 30m - mcap 17m - oil discovery just announced -- already close to cash flow positive -- worth watching esp those that like #jkx and #rpt
5699 2018-11-08 13:52:06 Wars for oil but no money to help the poor guys who did the dirty work
5700 2018-11-08 13:52:04 My makeup is too matte today. The oil will change this in an hour or two anyway

5712 2018-11-08 13:50:15 OPEC meeting this week

buying calls late Friday for next week could be fruitful

pretty certain OPEC is going to talk about production cuts during that weekend meeting 

they need to goose oil prices
5713 2018-11-08 13:50:13 We have some of the highest wages, hence higher prices and taxes. That's called cost of living, or abuse by big oil because we can pay more. We are also the largest state in the union so the homelessness population isn't as telling as the overall ratio. Things to consider.

5722 2018-11-08 13:48:09 It would be perfect to light up a room or passageway. I'm trying to date it. She painted this subject several times (mostly in oil) but this is the first pastel sketch I've seen
5723 2018-11-08 13:48:04 I had the Bolts as part of a parlay on Tues, so, I am more than comfortable fading the Oilers. That being said, I saw someone saying Fla was good up to -155 for tonight. Look, I know the Oil are in a tough overall rest spot but at least Talbot is rested and Fla doesn't look great
5724 2018-11-08 13:47:51 Soooo, that's a no?

5726 2018-11-08 13:47:24 There's too much to unpack here, but what I will say is that Trump actually gave China a wavier to buy Iranian oil just a few days ago.

The US does *better* when there's a China deficit, and Trump's moronic suggestions to the contrary are  ... well ... moronic.

5732 2018-11-08 13:46:46 @HeshmatAlavi  plz tell me will iran smuggle its oil to iraq to sell it.
5733 2018-11-08 13:46:43 #US exemption for Chabahar port & fuel supply to #Iraq, #Afghanistan & #China underlines the carrot and stick apprach and also keeps oil prices from going beyond a certain marker - which would be undesireable for world economy.
5734 2018-11-08 13:46:36 You are sadly right that that would be the reaction from some factions.

5738 2018-11-08 13:46:27 @chigrl let’s talk US oil . My prediction is a bounce at $58.4 ish if that doesn’t hold then looks like $53 is the next stop for that steam train of yours. What are your thoughts?
5739 2018-11-08 13:46:19 Not true. Crashing solar prices? You mean abandonment of solar by Australia and Germany. 
On what do you base your predictions? Oil demand is increasing. The world's poor benefit from having cheap reliable energy.

5756 2018-11-08 13:44:18 It's unbelievable to me how a modern warship can hit a slow moving oil tanker. Norwegian vikings used to sail over the atlantic in wooden ships 1000 years ago.
5757 2018-11-08 13:44:07 Norway has evacuated the entire crew of one of its warships after it collided in a fjord with an oil tanker.
Seven people were lightly injured in the collision in the Hjeltefjord near  Bergen in the early hours of Thursday, rescuers say. The frigate has been listing dangerously.

GOD BLESS Saudi Arabia
5762 2018-11-08 13:43:49 Currently 50% or so of exports are through the EU. Positioning of the Russian oil lines make that a problem. But then the US is a willing trading partner and so are the Japanese. Might need some clout from Americans to trade with Chinese and Russians then there is the Saudis.
5763 2018-11-08 13:43:48 Well a lot of us have to add oil to our hair  I had a friend that I had to warn when ever I oiled my scalp because she would physically crimge if she saw it

5780 2018-11-08 13:40:51 The Labour Party want Britain to stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia which will harm Britain more than it will harm Saudi Arabia.
The same applies to America where President Trump is correct that oil sanctions will hurt America more than Iran.

5796 2018-11-08 13:39:38 Sub-national policy for a ubiquitous tradable pollutant is a 2nd or 3rd best solution.  Same for national.  Montreal worked for simple mitigation.  Paris showed hope for GHGs.  Richest nation is #1 oil & gas producer and 2/3 of GDP is consumption.  Policy choice isn’t the issue.

5863 2018-11-08 13:32:47 The Scottish government does not own the oil/whisky etc. What it gets is tax on the profits on their sale. The oil companies/manufacturers/distributors/retailers etc get the profits.

Not sure which one it is, but one ends in the death of the child.

5905 2018-11-08 13:28:25 I thought more about your focus on FF subsidies. I think it's a very good idea! Here's why: FF subsidies allow and encourage the FF companies to produce marginal (low EREOI) oil. Removing subsidies makes that uneconomic and keeps it in the ground. Fracked oil would be an example.

5974 2018-11-08 13:18:38 @ROYALMRBADNEWS Sebastion Gorka said in a tweet to relagate Qanon to the snake oil heap. Now why would he do that? What's up with him now?
5975 2018-11-08 13:18:31 How many politicians actually change our lives? #Nixon saved my life with draft lottery. #Obama gave credit card companies a year "grace period" to rape and pillage. #Bush destroyed economy, lied us into war, jacked up oil prices. Ironically, so far, things go better with #Trump.

5982 2018-11-08 13:17:54 The £10M stuff is purely privitisation on a mass scale. I’ve been speaking with @LesWalton500 who has 40 years in education. His accredited organisation is excellent alternative to snake oil.

5991 2018-11-08 13:16:29 Thick and selfish is the small minded brainwashed/brain dead nationalists who regurgitate the same shite day in day out about Scottish oil (doesn’t exist) and Freeedumb. Oh and the Union flag on produce. It used to be amusing now it’s a joke. Thank God you’re in the minority.

6016 2018-11-08 13:14:36 We will see. Oil reflects economic demand. Gold monetary demand. No evidence monetary inflation has peaked.

6025 2018-11-08 13:13:37 The scare tactics worked.  Oil and gas told each of us they would raise the cost of gas.  At the same time, we continue to pass other levies that are collected each time we hit the pump...

6110 2018-11-08 13:03:53 tax returns? Who cares? He is rich anyway. This is important? How about thousands of gang members removed from our country..more minority opportunities..more Governorship control across the country...lower oil prices...your priorities are to care about this mans taxes?????

6117 2018-11-08 13:03:23 Crushing grapes gives flavor to wine. Crushing olives gives us oil. The situations of life that you think are crushing you are actually yielding God’s flavor and oil in your life.
6118 2018-11-08 13:03:16 This will be mainly reflected in the fuel bills for low-sulphur fuel oil, as there is no realistic alternative for the industry remaining compliant by 2020.

6124 2018-11-08 13:02:27 (pic on the right)Evening primrose oil is amazing for PMS symptoms, actual menstrual pain, menstrual acne and hair loss, tender breast.

I actually recommend everything in the left picture especially MACA AND SPIRULINA. Maca is an estrogen balance,(see next tweet)
6125 2018-11-08 13:02:10 omg, guys, so imagine a lan party, or a con, with that fountain, and instead of water, mineral oil and like 10+ pc's all cooled by it.
6126 2018-11-08 13:02:09 Очень часто езжу на поездах, маршрутках и метро. Чаще на метро.
Приблизительно раз в две недели мне нужно с перерывов в один день прокатиться на поезде домой четыре часа, а потом обратно. Ну, и когда приезжаю продолжаю этот обряд поездкой на метро и маршрутке, но иногда хожу пеша
6127 2018-11-08 13:01:50 The irony of that "infidel" tweet is that the so called "chosen ones" do not want a country of their own, they would rather live off the efforts of the infidels and their natural resources. Oya na, go form your own country, NO!! You want to chop oil money with infidel.
6128 2018-11-08 13:01:48 I wonder what 20 yrs of oil production has done for Norway...

6137 2018-11-08 13:00:57 Based on the assumption that the shift to low-sulphur fuel oil (LSFO 0.5%) will be 250 US dollars per tonne by 2020, Hapag-Lloyd estimates related costs of around 1 billion US dollars in the first years.
6138 2018-11-08 13:00:55 Only my dumbass would schedule a oil change and state inspection this early in the morning. I’m sick

6151 2018-11-08 13:00:02 Refined seed oil- the irony is most of the edible oils proposed in mkt which are positioned as healthy,lite, heart care oils are not even sourced from oil seeds but from objects which don't have oil in them naturally. Oil business is the biggest scam of the modern world.

6153 2018-11-08 12:59:50 Could be but what nobody is willing address the fact that oil and gas exploration helps employ thousands of people. Many people have to decide between good paying job and environment since they have families choice is made. How do you solve this REAL dilemma?
6154 2018-11-08 12:59:48 However, low sulfur oil bunkering will have to start in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the long round voyage times – which will mean higher costs for customers already by the end of next year.” Hapag-Lloyd reveals.

6162 2018-11-08 12:58:54 ma di niente, il mio si chiama ''Jason and the Argan oil'' e se hai i capelli misti tendenzialmente grassi te lo consiglio tanto
6163 2018-11-08 12:58:40 Блин, как? Вот прям всю шоколадку сразу? Не прерываясь? Люди, как вы можете так есть? 
Потому что я уже не могу после третьей пластиночки. Мне хочется пить, я просто умираю от жажды, и если я ем сладкое, я ВСЕГДА при этом много пью. Иначе никак.
6164 2018-11-08 12:58:31 It's just that most men know simple things like that and allot like to do it themselves because there are a lot of shady shops that will just top off your oil and leave the old filter in and will mess your engine up. I don't think he meant any shade towards women
6165 2018-11-08 12:58:30 I was stunned. Entertaining oil statesmen? No electric or hybrid cars. Not even trying to prevent climate disaster

6168 2018-11-08 12:58:14 But at least we now have a ban on oil drilling offshore! (Which is the same amendment as the ban on vaping in private businesses.  Like, the government now controls citizen’s rights on vaping indoors.)

6170 2018-11-08 12:58:07 Oil industry experts appreciate that the low sulphur fuel will be USD 150 to 250 more expensive than the current fuel oil with 3,5% sulphur.
6171 2018-11-08 12:58:07 How long will we have to wait get oil from them?
6172 2018-11-08 12:57:55 that coconut oil helped already

6186 2018-11-08 12:56:36 "However, there is still no ISO standard, and no specification yet. So each oil major is doing their own blending … As long as there is no specification the tendency seems to go with one of the world majors.” said Jorg Erdmann.
6187 2018-11-08 12:56:26 I remember that road for the quality of construction, especially given what happened to more expensive roads of the oil boom era. But I haven't been on it since 1995!

6189 2018-11-08 12:56:03 Yep, but will only need a quick 2-3 week stimulated fracking to gush. Mengo will need a bit more work and R's wont gush at all (although will still produce some oil)

6193 2018-11-08 12:55:42 A hybrid fuel is already on the horizon. 

Oil majors prepare to create a hybrid fuel, where residual fuel oil is mixed with a distillate and blended to reach the target 0.5% sulphur level.

6206 2018-11-08 12:53:29 Like seriously bro, you talk about the military, yet have never been close to combat, all you are is an empty barrel.

6213 2018-11-08 12:52:42 1. Using marine gas oil (MGO) or distillates, instead of high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO).
2. Using very-low-sulphur fuel oil or compliant fuel blends with 0.50% sulphur.
3. Retrofitting ships to use alternative fuels such as LNG.
6214 2018-11-08 12:52:35 They better do it quick as every week of growing inventories in the US is now anywhere from USD 1-3 lower on both Brent and WTI. I am only short OTM puts for expiry tomorrow and after that I will probably just stay away from oil.

6253 2018-11-08 12:47:31 Además hay que vigilar muy mucho los extractos que se utilizan, ya que en algunos casos estos contienen partículas insalubres. Como Mistery Oil. En cuanto a las partes plásticas, algunos tienen certificación médica. Por lo que son seguros. Gracias por tus comentarios.

6258 2018-11-08 12:47:11 Indian (or any other) tourist numbers can't make up for the drop in oil/gas output, slowdown in the crucial automobile sector (second largest sector within Iran and larger than all the other countries in the Middle East and Central Asia combined) and the petrochemical industry.

6260 2018-11-08 12:47:03 Since cap-and-trade passed in #CA, working class communities of color living near refineries/dirty power plants/etc. have seen their homes become environmental sacrifice zones.

6267 2018-11-08 12:46:43 Another hypothesis is that $TSLAQ is funded by big oil money like Koch brothers or Saudis. They have upside from delaying, if not stopping $TSLA
Saudis buying Tesla shares is not inconsistent if the strategy is to kill. They can time the off loading of shares.

6306 2018-11-08 12:41:17 Uzair makes a few erroneous assumptions here. There's no waiver for India in doing business with Iran, no reason to build better business ties w/India (already very good). Although oil revenue is only 1/3rd of the govt's revenue, carpets can't cover that gap!

6311 2018-11-08 12:40:57 Tips for better chicken:
Use batter
Twice fry. first at lower heat to cook the chicken, then second to get it crispy.
Season the batter as well.
Shallow fry. Oil would be at about half the height of the chicken. Makes for better flavor, also chemistry says it's better

6387 2018-11-08 12:30:21 Really? But it was ok for Venezuela to control its OPEC purse when it dropped oil production to drive up oil prices. And when the local fuel price goes up because the OPEC oil price goes up, yall are the first ones that cry!

6401 2018-11-08 12:28:43 Crude continues to show strength largely due to the momentum from oil prices and US sanctions that are giving the market some wind in its sail. A strong VLCC market has supported the suez& afra sectors, pushing up rates again this week. Clean market remains disappointing #tankers
6402 2018-11-08 12:28:29 Oil extends losing streak as supplies grow
6403 2018-11-08 12:28:23 Yes, we offer a gluten-free batter. For intolerances, we use the standard fryers and for Celiac orders, we use separate oil that has to be heated so we advise your order may take a little longer. Our batter is also dairy-free.
6404 2018-11-08 12:28:18 In the morning i eat greek yoghurt/quark with fruit. As lunch i prefer soup or lettuce/salads. (Don't like bread) and for dinner mostly fish, vegatable and rice. Fish fat is healthy. Fish oil is also good for the skin.
6405 2018-11-08 12:28:10 Neo-liberals don't give a crap about progressives, pissed-off or otherwise. Voters just handed control of the House back to Wall Street puppets, instead of to Exxon/Mobile and rest of Gas and Oil Pigs (GOP).
6406 2018-11-08 12:28:07 What sanctions did I not lift those? UN sanctions and how sanctions! I don’t like sanctions are rude. They starve people. Food for oil I wrote a paper and I decide to lift sanctions. Cool huh? Sanctions in space easements and leases. Not a problem. Understand how to beat cases.

6412 2018-11-08 12:27:09 Both seem good. It’s a lease so I’d hope I never see the mechanics outside of oil changes and tire rotations.
6413 2018-11-08 12:27:04 @lbc @mrjamesob Although many people associate lather with the cleaning  properties of soap, it is actually an incidental property resulting from  the way the soap molecules are drawn to dirt and oil.

6422 2018-11-08 12:24:58 2. A big issue is that making a product from oil is not really sustainable. Bioplastics made from straw and bamboo do exist, but they release a number of chemicals as they break down and use land that could be used for food. I think recyclable materials like cardboard are best.

6437 2018-11-08 12:22:22 2/2 if people want to get excited about this then the answer is not attack eating meat but attack buying products grown where there was rainforest. So no South American soya or beef, no south Asian palm oil. Support European farmers and encourage production at home.

Until that happens, the citizens would not know that its the tax that they paid that is being mismanaged.

The tug boat was _not_ involved. That is: direct hit between the oil tanker and the navy frigate. The frigate then lost steering and drifted ashore. Damages both above and below waterline. Voluntarily beached in steep slope.

6548 2018-11-08 12:03:39 Yay! I’m so glad to hear that! Any oil is ok, olive oil is too expensive to use for that. Vegetable oil is ok. Just dont forget to rub it with oil after you clean and before putting it away. And yes, food tastes so much better, right? 
6549 2018-11-08 12:03:03 Thanks.  It is not only about the dollar.  The only reason why Europe does not speak German today was oil from OPEC countries!

6837 2018-11-08 11:14:51 Big difference between bid and transaction. We finally have some US clarity as to who is in the open market, how much for & how long. This gives a clue as to the likely amount of off market Iranian oil available to subvert the aggregate market bid once Iran has filled storage

6839 2018-11-08 11:14:33 He speaks sense. The hullabaloo about a currency reform without addressing fundamentals and production is akin to changing pots. That wont bring food to table. Currency is a medium for starters. Why import wheat, crude oil and not farm that here

6857 2018-11-08 11:11:36 Maybe so, but how do you know whether they spend oil money or money from banking and construction, from which they make billions. If you went to split hairs over it, you could say all money in the world is “touched” by oil at some point.

6859 2018-11-08 11:11:28 No. No and no. They live in Norway and look after themselves and their interests. Somehow they manage to extract their oil at maximum profit whilst the UK manages a loss when oil was at a low.

6955 2018-11-08 10:54:47 Yes, buy a dictionary. “Arab” is a specifically ethnic term. “Middle east” is specifically geographical, that very relevantly refers to where the oil that is the direct source of the amount of money now destabilising the game to new degrees comes from. Not hard.

Zawsze mnie dziwiło, że lekarze z jednej strony płacąc na izbę sporo, z drugiej strony mało się nią interesują.

6971 2018-11-08 10:52:36 In August the API Gravity of Crude oil input to refineries fell to 31.80, the lowest level since April 2017. 

The API peaked at 32.55 in February this year.

Means refiners tried to increase the amount of distillates they produce and reduce Light products.

7043 2018-11-08 10:39:37 For now oil has already taken a huge beating...We may limp along the current levels into year end but in Q1 the surplus gets very serious and if OPEC does not cut get put of the way as this can really take a fall.

45 obliterated 300 Russians on the battlefield.

7200 2018-11-08 10:11:04 I say it's mostly because they limit it to targeted news and not the full news.

7211 2018-11-08 10:08:11 No Beard oil grows beards. Beard growth is genetics or surgical. What oil does is promote healthy beard hair. Thicker. More manageable. Etc. It can improve growth but not on the sense that you’ll go from bald to Rick Toss because of beard oil.

7315 2018-11-08 09:47:37 I've to disagree, @aantonop uses to refers to other as an oil snake sellers, but as usually happens with psychopathic personalities the oil snake seller is himself. His speech is far away from educative (try to understand something from his books and you will get why).

7675 2018-11-08 08:33:07 It takes 60 - 70% more electricity to make the hydrogen to move a hydrogen fuel cell car a mile than to move a battery vehicle the same distance. This increases the load on the grid which will make it take longer to switch to renewables, increasing use of oil & gas

7681 2018-11-08 08:32:07 I use 10% cbd oil, 2-3 drops 2-3 times a day, before bed and in morning especially. Some people swear by the rub and the vape is good for instant relief. Have to experiment to see what works for you man, but I'd start with oil

7692 2018-11-08 08:29:19 If you know the amount of money tourism generate for countries who invested heavily in tourism, you won't say this. 

I've been to Kenya and Rwanda. I know this for a fact. 

Nigeria should invest more in tourism not only oil.

7694 2018-11-08 08:28:58 You Congis would never have thought of saving 60k crores per year in savings by using the indigenous RuPay cards. PM Modi's policies are helping us import oil from Iran even after US sanctions. This phattu economist of your standard won't understand
7695 2018-11-08 08:28:31 I feel you, but the change is happening, we will be a country that produces oil and gas and gains nothing with it. Might as well have Mozambicans working in the system (no matter how flawed that system is)
I, as a Mozambican environmentalist, am working in the oil and gas sector
7696 2018-11-08 08:28:18 Agree happily took more, mm took out a few there and I couldn’t buy anything under 7. Rather replace a drill bit than no oil or the Well has issues. Small delay the oil is still there, great comms.

7703 2018-11-08 08:26:40 MAM- the common people mainly complains due to the reasons Modi fought for/against before - he now embodies them . For example , he criticized oil price rise before 2014 - now under his GOVT , the prices are too high !

7721 2018-11-08 08:22:45 also most toners are supposed to be used as a cleanser to remove any remaining oil and a ph balancer so if u use it 7 times in a row not only does it strip away at the skin it throws off the ph balance of ur skin
7722 2018-11-08 08:22:32 Well take green energy. Saudi's lowered their oil prices attempting to bankrupt them. To bring back dependence on their oil, then raising  prices back up. Don't you think by them lowering affected profits? Though Trump countered this too. The world will come to us in the long run
7723 2018-11-08 08:22:28 @MsAlliance   I was aware of that and I am sure I read that their most profitable fraud is olive oil

7726 2018-11-08 08:21:50 Only industrial shipment via Kyaukpyu will be oil. Pipeline & terminal are parts of CN's plans. There have been railway thru the Alps in Europe for many years. I assume CN has this capability as well. RR in Yunnan & Guizhou, similar terrain as Myanmar. Terrain not a showstopper.

We cook normally, with rapeseed or olive oil. We use only plastic or wooden utensils. We hand wash. We don't use scrubbers. If required we season them.

These latest ones were brilliant, for a couple of weeks ..

7811 2018-11-08 08:02:01 "Patience is like good motor oil. It doesn't remove all the contaminants. It just puts them into suspension, so they don't get into your works and seize them up. Patient people have, so to speak, a large crankcase. They can put a lot of irritants into suspension."

7828 2018-11-08 07:59:46 What press? What attacks? Go look at the constitution, does it define "The Press" as resembling a Corrupt Communist Politcal Cabal that happens to have bought a lot of media assets & employed a lot of left progressive carpet baggers & snake oil salesmen to spew their opinion. No!
7829 2018-11-08 07:59:39 Oil companies own the world (specially poor countries as evidenced by our new agreement), they would never let that happen
7830 2018-11-08 07:59:31 Don’t they have enough oil that they need to purchase @FirstSquawk
7831 2018-11-08 07:59:23 Personally would prefer to see an oil strike as I like to see people making money and also (more importantly) I like making money.  Those who delight in the misfortunes of others are too emotionally involved and usually end up being net losers. Fine by me.
7832 2018-11-08 07:59:23 This poor state doesn't have money to buy oxygen...
But have money to buy oil for lamp
7833 2018-11-08 07:59:22 Cool. As I said it wasn't about AAOG but the operation update, even though investors do not want delays, does sound like they are being rightfully cautious. They've got to be, its their big drill.
7834 2018-11-08 07:59:07 Social bigotry not an exclusive preserve of the illiterate or the poor. Many countries not far west from India -- wealthy from oil revenues, but equally high on the religious bigotry and extremism front.
7835 2018-11-08 07:58:35 Of course it is, and it’s led by hypocritical clubs that were built on rich owners - City have taken it to another level and there are only so many Oil Billionaires interested in football. FFP was to avoid clubs over stretching I.e Portsmouth

7838 2018-11-08 07:58:13 The world is funny, if the government finds diamonds or oil in our backward, it's government property, but if they find drugs it's yours.
7839 2018-11-08 07:58:09 I make up quasi-scientific fairy tales. My neighbor calls it "Al Gore's Global Warming".  So I just say, well you know all that oil is made up of stuff that was on the surface of the earth when it was really hot, so by bringing it back up to the surface we're making it really hot
7840 2018-11-08 07:58:00 #KweseHeadStart- call it sour grapes- Hearts of Oak will continue sinking further and wont even discover oil.

7849 2018-11-08 07:57:04 Agreed, and Cruz from what I heard made a great acceptance speech. 'The good people of Texas' were right to reject snake oil salesman, Beto.

7851 2018-11-08 07:56:29 I think oil quality is also a variable. I have exceeded the 5000km once and I didn't like the behavior of the engine
7852 2018-11-08 07:56:29 The oil that was running out in 2014? Or was that just another unionist lie?
7853 2018-11-08 07:56:12 Here in Wa. Texas oil poured nearly $30 million in ads to prevent a measure that would hold big oil accountable
7854 2018-11-08 07:56:11 I hear what you are saying Justin but I think on this one I will Hold. 
Right decision ..time will tell.
7855 2018-11-08 07:56:09 Not going buts at all, I've been quite civilised in comparison to your insults. Yes Oil is on the up. so you agree that it's volatile then? I think you need to read up on how duty and tax work. SNP made oil cornerstone of White Paper prohections in 2014. Were they wrong to do so?
7856 2018-11-08 07:55:45 send tea tree oil.
7857 2018-11-08 07:55:31 This is why the USA should keep its nose out of the affairs of the Middle East. Syria was and will be again a secular country. The war was not sectarian. It was NOT Sunni via Shia. It was an invasion by TERRORISTS and the West ie USA over OIL. And Israel making a grab for land.
7858 2018-11-08 07:55:11 #aow2018 the panel raises a key point that one of the most important 'above the ground' risk in Africa is the speed of decision making and that has been the difference of when first Oil comes out.

I like oil painting {I'm not fond of acrylic painting}, but love watercolours. Yes, people say that oil/acrylic painting is easier. Maybe because they're forgiving & allow you to fix your mistakes. :)

Even if all the world embraces Asad, they can't legitimate his regime.

7896 2018-11-08 07:49:00 A little research is even a problem to this government. Oil price is now an average of $70/barrel! It was merely $17.44 in 1999, Up till 2007, it was less than the current average yet the govt increased minimum wage and made important reforms and repaid debts., 1999-2014 my foot.

7915 2018-11-08 07:44:42 I like that they are taking no risks, at no cost to company, also before drilling deeper and all to expectations thus far, to me suggests oil found at top layers and need permission to release content but didn’t want to take risks for lower zones

Revenues go to WM, Scotland only sees a fraction. Would you rather have 15% of $35 a barrel or 100%? And now price levels are high again, that’s a lot of Scotland’s revenues going to WM.

Wake up fool, oil is only a small part of our wealth.
7920 2018-11-08 07:44:17 It's really not most of those things. Oil sands, not shale. No real estate bubble, see Vancouver and TO. Hookers? No more than anywhere else. Unabated capitalism- ish, if you consider the previous gov't. I've never owned a cowboy hat in my life. Not very American.
7921 2018-11-08 07:44:01 Hmmm, big, sweaty, RW self-important lout who considers himself a journalist and inserts himself into the conservative political landscape to the detriment of humanity....well, oil be damned.

7928 2018-11-08 07:43:04 A very unhealthy similarity between the Trump gov and the Tories we have to put up with in our England. These Demigods claim they represent the people.They are Orchestrated and funded by global corps especially desperate dyeing Oil Industry. Oppression NOT representation.

7934 2018-11-08 07:40:54 And you think they will do all that?
Workers should brace up for backlog of salary arrears. They should pray that oil price will continue to soar or else...

7936 2018-11-08 07:40:49 Budget for a body that will manage funds from oil( if ever found) and other minerals.

7937 2018-11-08 07:40:42 Lovely! I always find watercolor more fascinating than oil painting although people say it's (oil painting) easier and more versatile.

How can ANYONE see trump as good??? 

He cheated on his wives. He couldn't even commit to 1 woman, being married 3 X. 
He's allowing protected lands 2B decimated for the purpose of LOOKING for oil.
He's alienated allies. 
He lies. 
He's a hypocrite.
& more.
7948 2018-11-08 07:39:18 I'm finding it increasingly difficult to buy anything in your stores as so many of your products contain PALM OIL. My conscience doesn't allow for killing orangutans so that I can eat cake and biscuits.

7954 2018-11-08 07:37:50 The Birther, climate change denying Congressman of my rural, conservative oil driven district decided to run for governor. He was beaten by a Latina democrat. His vacant seat was just filled by another Latina Democrat. Overall, a really good midterm for NM.

7976 2018-11-08 07:33:38 You didn't read white paper projections then? You didn't see debate with Darling and Salmond then?

8010 2018-11-08 07:26:20 I met a taxi driver in Stockholm who was originally from Syria. He said the problem was never the Assad family but America's disagreement with whom Syria sold oil to and their lack of use of the US dollar.

8228 2018-11-08 06:45:14 I think that there are many people who believe in climate change, but they just don't care because there is a buck to be made. It's unconscionable in my eyes. Look at the big oil companies trying to get legislation to protect them from rising sea water.

8237 2018-11-08 06:43:31 International crude oil prices have fallen 18.5% in the last 5 weeks ..... add in the currency appreciation .... so, logically, will we see a 20+% fall in petrol prices? Tui ad?

8244 2018-11-08 06:42:04 I think the growth for pigment sector would come from exports so companies which are export oriented could be beneficiary others which are focused on domestic demand would see a nominal growth also crude oil price is key which decides the margin
8245 2018-11-08 06:41:54 vegetable oil.... Crude oil.... Only a marginal difference really
8246 2018-11-08 06:41:39 I worked on an offshore oil platform for years and they  vent more than they report. They are supposed to tell MMS and never do.

8253 2018-11-08 06:41:05 With this news, @RachelNotley I want to know what you will do, now and if re-elected, to push for Canadian oil independence? More refineries, a trans-Canada pipeline?

8257 2018-11-08 06:40:22 its called flaring...a typical practice in oil refinery procedures. Now when the flaring ends up causing power outages...that's not supposed to happen. lol

8262 2018-11-08 06:39:35 I second the #NoDAPL irritation--especially on the night of Nov. 20, 2016 when net allies used social media to try to get her help regarding events on Hwy 1806 bridge & were rebuffed & staff ignored live video. Only Sanders spoke out.  No one else had guts to oppose ETP/Big Oil.
8263 2018-11-08 06:39:25 Answer a question when it's asked, whether you like it or not. Don't blame others, take responsibility. Don't throw oil on a fire. Be of service to the people of the US. TELL THE TRUTH.

8266 2018-11-08 06:39:07 The sad part is you people don't understand that USA funds the so called rebels to destabilise the region so that they can steal all the oil. Same they did with Venezuela. It's sad. You are the All knowledgeable. Hahahaha but just knowledge won't help if you can't analyse.

8291 2018-11-08 06:34:11 The Canadian gov't can decide who we import from and who we export to.  They could also decide to use Can oil on east coast refineries rather than Saudi or Nigerian.  They decided not to.

8305 2018-11-08 06:32:32 I think the only reason why this govt is going thru all this embarassment on DeMo, oil prices & rupee devalution is because they mocked a genuinely decent & honest man, Manmohan Singh.

8310 2018-11-08 06:31:43 Excellent point. Sure it's cheaper to send oil out of the country to refine, but then again, resources are finite. We wouldn't need kilometres worth of pipeline if we invested in refining our own oil.

8496 2018-11-08 05:58:20 the bad news is that my cat spilled my entire bottle of teatree oil in my bathroom the good news is my bathroom has never smelled better
8497 2018-11-08 05:58:17 every time i take nyquil after drinking tea/drinking whiskey/eating garlic/using oregano oil, i feel exactly like that scene in clockstoppers where he uses his timestopping watch inside an already timestopped area to stop time FURTHER
8498 2018-11-08 05:57:59 not to scar you or anything but we also pour beaten egg yolk into oil like jalebi and then soak it in sugar syrup
8499 2018-11-08 05:57:56 I need brake oil
8500 2018-11-08 05:57:45 What a beautiful animal! Let's hope there's enough oil to support saving this horse in the wild and to provide many more water wells for the local people of the area. I love holding shares in a company with a social agenda too.

8503 2018-11-08 05:57:22 It’s too bad.  When will rural America realize its being sold the snake oil from the GOp.  I would love to see a unity ticket of a moderate dem and bull moose Republican.

8506 2018-11-08 05:57:07 Colorado Prop 112 would have required future oil and gas development to be set back 2500 ft from residential area, water sources and other areas designated vulnerable.

8508 2018-11-08 05:56:39 Common misconception. It's actually "T in man" because he's a very fancy old fashioned teapot. Having to oil them ruined the flavor so the fad didn't last long.
8509 2018-11-08 05:56:37 I just shaved literally my entire body besides my head of hair, did a face mask, lotioned my whole body, did bio oil for my two recent acne scars and stretch marks, and did rose water on my face and a facial moisturizer. My skin feels so loved. 
8510 2018-11-08 05:56:36 Being an adult means remembering to get the oil changed in your car before you have 10% oil. I am not an adult.
8511 2018-11-08 05:56:19 Unpopular opinion but : People who don’t know the difference between there, their & they’re deserve to be put into refugee camps where they shave you bald & slap you across the head with baby oil one by one.

8524 2018-11-08 05:55:04 As if you know all different communities in Kerala and also, depending on how narrow minded u are to declare communities living in Kerala for over 100years are NOT Keralites. Just to educate u a bit, some take oil bath, some make special sweets (their community special) etc.
8525 2018-11-08 05:55:03 I’ve seen that promotion when I pass by but it doesn’t add up to me it’s something I wouldn’t do just oil cost around 35 bucks for me plus filter 15 bucks more that’s a trip if you see what I’m trying to say I mean it’s good but to me I’d be sketch
8526 2018-11-08 05:54:53 How about the resources available to us since 2015? Since PMB came into power, oil has consistently sold above the budgeted benchmark, so technically, we are in an oil boom already but what has been done with it? 
Where are the extra savings? Where are the infrastructures?
8527 2018-11-08 05:54:45 Yes! Well it’s more the drilling underground for oil type explosives lol but still it’s pretty cool. Since there’s Halliburton’s all over the world and explosives are only done here.

8539 2018-11-08 05:52:46 I can’t sleep. Curtis and Walton have rivals who sell a different kind of snake oil type thing. It’s two bros who are both friendly and charming family men and Walton just kinda brushes them off but Curtis wants to break their noses.
8540 2018-11-08 05:52:38 The first world war was nothing to do with oil. But it was everything to do with Land Grabbing. The British Empire had lots of it, The German Empire didn't have very much and wanted much more. It was the pinnacle of the growing tide of Nationalism that was sweeping Europe.
8541 2018-11-08 05:52:36 What are they using recycled oil ? Thats stupid cheap I wouldn’t even do it ahah no mames thats wild

8545 2018-11-08 05:51:01 My favorite was a few years ago when stocks rallied because [checks notes] oil prices were either rising or falling. 
8546 2018-11-08 05:50:58 Do a simple search on international crude oil prices.

Moreover with India granted a waiver on Iranian crude purchase, can expect a slight drop in coming days too

8554 2018-11-08 05:50:19 Just don't use Palm Oil - it's junk food with 50% saturated fat and tastes like crap.  If you stop using it, demand for more deforested areas will dwindle.  I've been to Borneo and seen the destruction!
8555 2018-11-08 05:50:13 Big news would be that eastern pipeline has sailed thru Quebec to save our economy! Saudis can keep their oil!

8557 2018-11-08 05:50:02 #NemamiriroAkaitaZvinhu I always say grace before I eat because every meal is a story of a hustle, the salt on the table, the oil that fried the veggies and if i'm lucky to have meat issa miracle, never knowing what my next meal will be.

8772 2018-11-08 05:13:37 So if you read all my tweets, I hope I've answered your questions. CBD is like any other health supplement such as fish oil, etc. Expect CBD is made from the parts of the Marijuana plant that doesn't make people HIGH and it has health benefits. :)

Nuclear test, mining, oil extraction and fracking is not helping.
8774 2018-11-08 05:13:23 9/11 happened because Osama Bin-Laudin didn't want to stop at just talking crap about US in the Middle East. 9/11 caused invasion of Iraq even if the WMD's info was wrong. Bush wanted more than Iraqi oil, Bush was wrong not to verify WMD info but if no 9/11, no Iraq. Wrong again.

8777 2018-11-08 05:13:08 If we had invested the money we threw at big oil into other renewables, solar/hydro would be far more advanced. Maybe we'd find a way to keep installers safe on the roofs. Again, my beef is the non-renewables that are lethal & destructive.

8779 2018-11-08 05:12:52 Offering money and "aid" on seemingly generous terms, Russians and Chinese seek joint ventures on strategic resources like energy, oil, gas, hi-tech systems, IT, and the like. Let's hope our government doesn't fall into the Debt Trap that such big budget items can lead into.

8781 2018-11-08 05:12:29 Here we go again!! The Oil and Gas Cabal here in Colorado is negligent and irresponsible in its handling of its Wells and the Safety of the Public and the environment!!  The Commision just covers for them!  Wonder what Perks they get for doing so—all industry insiders!
8782 2018-11-08 05:12:12 We are always half way. Just consider the polluting industries and automobiles since decades. Crackers is just a short time phenomenon. Reduce automobiles and save oil and foreign exchange, use public transport.
8783 2018-11-08 05:12:01 There's no "ism" that would work well for them at this point because they've been in an economic battle with the largest economy in the world, all because they had the audacity to think perhaps the oil reserves under their country should meet the needs of their people, not Exxon.

8786 2018-11-08 05:11:36 Public ethics is about putting the interests of society above those of your own or those your political party. Malema's utterance goes against this principle. But then populism is inherently unethical because it prays on the vulnerable selling then snake oil remedies.

8841 2018-11-08 05:00:17 This is not going to work in the long run. All major oil importing countries must speed up work on alternate sources of energy so that they are not blackmailed by OPEC. They should make a plan to completely stop their oil imports from OPEC in the next few years.

He was quite a mess until I changed it all.
8876 2018-11-08 04:56:18 Ah, but Duke, killing a US resident journalist, employed by an American company, is a first for the Saudis. And hasn’t Trump crowed about our oil independence?  No, I’m afraid Donald and Jared are a bit too involved in personal biz with Saudis.
8877 2018-11-08 04:56:17 Hence there is a "sudo" cap on oil prices and that cap is the level of output where it is economically profitable for US to continue producing.

8889 2018-11-08 04:54:11 Right. If Russia or OPEC cut output prices would obviously rise, BUT they would only rise to the point where it becomes economical for US Oil producers to begin production. The increase in supply reduces oil prices to the point where it is no longer profitable for US to produce.

8908 2018-11-08 04:52:15 Funny enough it tastes better than palm oil beans
8909 2018-11-08 04:52:08 It’s an 8-4 Oil Barons lead after a goalmouth scramble on the powerplay. 

8-4 @MOBHockey.

8910 2018-11-08 04:51:59 Hey @Drake @RogersPlace Do a God damn sound check for gods sake. The sound in this building is absolute garbage right now. Can't understand a word. What a rip off!!!! #DoBetter #thissucks #yeg #drake
8911 2018-11-08 04:51:56 If you wait for your oil change while someone else does it , can’t make you to busy haha
8912 2018-11-08 04:51:37 We just got some new *Strawnana - 1g C3 THC Oil Cartridge - Sativa*
8913 2018-11-08 04:51:34 Many Texas big hairs have an oil derrick or two in their backyards and fancy themselves future oil tycoons. They're dyed-in-the-wool Republicans. 
As for Cruz' "victory," there were so many shenanigans in Texas on Tuesday, it seems doubtful that Cruz actually won. #Rapepubliklans
8914 2018-11-08 04:51:31 Hence the extra large jar of coconut oil
8915 2018-11-08 04:51:30 The oil industry has 11 trillion in stranded assets.  They are hard pressed to change.
8916 2018-11-08 04:51:16 Going to be a great run,!!
8917 2018-11-08 04:51:11 日常系か鬱系のおすすめアニメありますか～？
8918 2018-11-08 04:50:58 Hardly any effect on oil temp. More of a safety measure for the faulty PCV
8919 2018-11-08 04:50:47 Nope. Because he did put his hands on her and use force and I’m no liberal, but I am just about to use the word “mansplain”. There’s video ffs.
8920 2018-11-08 04:50:46 Even Stanley Oil guy (Stanley Uzochukwu) standing with them knows that he can't come back to his village OSUMENYI in Nnewi south LGA to say buhari. They are just misbehaving for their selfish interest especially for their businesses. They're too small to dictate for Ndi igbo
8921 2018-11-08 04:50:44 Try to actively think about how your body feels. If im not staring in front of a computer screen all day i will eat 1.5-2 times as much because i actually am aware of how hungry i am. A tablespoon of olive oil has like 100 calories and is good fats so if all else fails do that
8922 2018-11-08 04:50:35 The more big oil is forced to spend on propaganda the less  they have available to trash the  by extracting fossil fuels. In the coming years as climate chaos gets worse they’ll be overwhelmed w initiatives against them. They may have won the battle but they’ll lose the war
8923 2018-11-08 04:50:32 Even Stanley Oil guy (Stanley Uzochukwu) standing with them knows that he can't come back to his village OSUMENYI in Nnewi south LGA to say buhari. They are just misbehaving for their selfish interest especially for their businesses. They're too small to dictate for Ndi igbo
8924 2018-11-08 04:50:20 Hey You!!

GO GET AN OIL CHANGE
8925 2018-11-08 04:50:02 Yes that’s what I do with my hair. Leave in conditioner then I apply oil to seal it. I also follow @LaBeautyologist for tips.
8926 2018-11-08 04:49:54 When everyone knows that you are all about bullshit noone will ever take you seriously... Supa arrest, Pari arrest, megadeals, Muzarabani oil and gas, Chinhoyi desiel, endless list... Now it's good times will soon come... But why asi Zanu???
8927 2018-11-08 04:49:53 Coconut oil
8928 2018-11-08 04:49:40 Like, what if you brought a motorcycle to work and rode it around the office and output noxious fumes and crashed into people and spilled oil on the carpet and made people pet it and say how pretty it is and then you gently chided it after scaring people by revving it at them?
8929 2018-11-08 04:49:40 trying to get rid of 2 cystic pimples that i’ve had for weeks

8933 2018-11-08 04:48:30 idk what i ever did without peppermint essential oil tbh. super good for nausea
8934 2018-11-08 04:48:19 Because the Conservatives spent so long in austerity and then there was the early 2015 recession (decline in oil prices) that the current government realized that it had to give the economy a jolt - see Bank of Canada points.
8935 2018-11-08 04:48:16 Why bother with the olive oil?
8936 2018-11-08 04:47:57 Vetiver is one of my favorite oil sleep aids.
8937 2018-11-08 04:47:40 I JUST rubbed myself down with body butter and coconut oil not two hours ago. What I see? Ash. Disrespectful!
8938 2018-11-08 04:47:39 I feel like if @GOODMlAD came out with a Good Guy Beard Oil it would do numbers
8939 2018-11-08 04:47:26 How about apologizing to Alberta for not getting the pipeline through and keeping the economy crippled because of it. I guess Saudi and Venezuela oil is fine because we don't see the face of the oppressed people there. Attaboy Justin.
8940 2018-11-08 04:47:18 We just got some new *Pineapple Express - 1g C3 THC Oil Cartridge - Sativa*
8941 2018-11-08 04:47:11 i just wanna help out & say dont use dove on your face bc it’ll strip it of the natural oils that help keep your face supple since it’s meant for the thicker skin on the body. also coconut oil isn’t a good moisturizer for your face, it’s not noncomedogenic so it clogs your pores
8942 2018-11-08 04:47:09 Which means oil is due for a big bounce !!! Buy oil
8943 2018-11-08 04:47:03 If anyone is travelling to Bali soon, or lives here, and can bring us donations of pure essential Lavender oil, the clinic urgently needs more. We use the pure essential oil; if its blended with a carrier oil, ie for massage, we won't be able to use. Thank you! OM shanti.
8944 2018-11-08 04:46:46 yep!  was more worried about a general turn-down on economy with housing down...still am, still short xhb kre oil....but hey a few days of up is nice.

8946 2018-11-08 04:46:35 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
8947 2018-11-08 04:46:29 Side note: Don't fucking buy from @vrcover, they are literally snake oil salesmen.
8948 2018-11-08 04:45:59 This could also be seen as China wanting to take advantage of lower oil prices to build up its crude storage further before Brent increases (in other words, China calling a bottom in oil prices)
8949 2018-11-08 04:45:50 An explosion blew a door off the auto shop building in Sartell yesterday which caused 450,000 thousand dollars of damage and sent 1000 gallons oil and chemicals into a storm drain and to the Mississippi River.
8950 2018-11-08 04:45:49 Nahe nahe oil Wala nai khata ..only boiled.
8951 2018-11-08 04:45:10 US producers only wish OPEC would reduce output.

It is true that slumps in the oil prices hurt US producers, but the fact that the US is capable of producing at high levels there is now a sudo cap on oil prices.

8956 2018-11-08 04:44:14 I have the sweetest boyfriend ever I swear I haven't been sleeping well at all so even tho he is in so much pain he is still trying to find ways to help me sleep better he has suggested CBD oil and gummies and he even gave me a shirt of his to sleep with with his scent
8957 2018-11-08 04:44:12 When oil prices drop they say it is priced in US DOLLARS and claim the £ is down against the US dollar. All a con trick
8958 2018-11-08 04:44:11 Why, you want to watch the effects of oil prices changing?
8959 2018-11-08 04:44:06 マルチタスクマジで脳に悪い
8960 2018-11-08 04:43:48 So you’d recommend a leave in conditioner first then the coconut oil? I’ve never heard of those other two but my skin is naturally oily
8961 2018-11-08 04:43:47 *argan oil too... looks like you’ve actually been rejuvenated by the sleep you got no matter how many hours
8962 2018-11-08 04:43:39 I step up, fifty-two block yo massage, peppermint oil, the hudson or get my sess pass the written like he strip-searched
8963 2018-11-08 04:43:32 Oil and gas is classified "industrial"; normally communities seek to place appropriate separation between "residential" and industrial activities, precisely because unforeseen accidents associated with oil and gas activities can negatively impact neighborhoods. This is 1 example.
8964 2018-11-08 04:43:18 Just like coconut oil, I am also:

• organic
• virgin
• unrefined
• bottled in a facility that also processes peanuts

8968 2018-11-08 04:43:09 Not sure how much you beat on your car but the 03 models are known to lose third gear and have really bad oil issues, they don’t really become present if you don’t beat on the car you shouldn’t have any issues

8974 2018-11-08 04:42:02 I can't wait how to learn how to change my oil via hankcon makeouts
8975 2018-11-08 04:41:54 They say it’s for sealing in moisture so if you don’t apply a moisturizer first, you’re just sealing in dryness. I hear jojoba or argon oil is better for your face in general.
8976 2018-11-08 04:41:53 I left my backpack at work an it has my brush an coconut oil in it
8977 2018-11-08 04:41:48 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
8978 2018-11-08 04:41:39 Please stop using the old, tired "data is the new oil." 

Stop, please. It's already 2018.

8982 2018-11-08 04:41:10 There is now a cap on how high oil prices will get. OPEC has lost almost all control.
8983 2018-11-08 04:41:07 We just got some new *Gelato - 1g C3 THC Oil Cartridge - Hybrid*
8984 2018-11-08 04:40:51 Unacceptable.  Big Oil just #played Colorado voters.

8992 2018-11-08 04:40:16 If Morneau was going to do something he would have done it long ago. The Librals and NDP are shutting down the Oil Industry and Alberta will not forget.

8995 2018-11-08 04:40:01 I used wound saline and mine healed fine! If you ever get the bump by it then tea tree oil works great
8996 2018-11-08 04:40:00 Poor snowflake, he had to defend himself from that young female intern retrieving the mike...Dear God she could have killed him...
8997 2018-11-08 04:39:35 A4: I took an oil painting class for fun and I would constantly be telling the kids about what I was learning and how difficult it was, BUT also how much I loved it. Creativity is so fun but you have to work at it some times. #UTedChat
8998 2018-11-08 04:39:29 @Imperfectfruit bring back the olive oil if possible!
8999 2018-11-08 04:39:06 Others are doing the same. Shell also and here smaller (but big in our context) oil companies do their best to market themselves as biofuel companies. Some also lobby against EVs.
9000 2018-11-08 04:39:06 This I got. It's painted lavender. OH built me a table that fits across, to hold wine & book. And we have a terrific water heater.

I can be in that tub for hours. Coconut oil & scented oils. Wine.
9001 2018-11-08 04:39:01 It’s at wal mart. It’s around the oil sections. Like essential oil section. It just numbs it more and last longer than oraljel. It’s just not pleasant to taste but it works ALOT
9002 2018-11-08 04:39:00 Listen... I'm currently laying here with some almond oil & tea tree oil on my hand. 
9003 2018-11-08 04:38:59 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
9004 2018-11-08 04:38:55 He didn’t punch her. You ppl need to get a grip
9005 2018-11-08 04:38:50 Aye with a state oil fund that can move markets.
9006 2018-11-08 04:38:20 @ChickfilA Hi why are fries not fried in peanut oil?
9007 2018-11-08 04:38:20 And then he promptly fires Sessions and brings on a shady loyalist to prove the point he is nothing more than a snake oil salesman.
9008 2018-11-08 04:38:20 Yup, that's it. So why are we making a federal case out of it?
9009 2018-11-08 04:38:18 They think the 1st amendment protects reporters who are being unhinged d*ckheads from suffering the consequences of their actions.  He was told to put down the microphone and refused.  He tried to turn the presser into his personal protest.
9010 2018-11-08 04:38:14 @Sphere_Sundry I cannot wait to use my mercury cazimi oil & Moon-Neptune water, thank you again for your amazing offerings  And I have a reading with @AustinRCoppock this weekend. I’m really good at buying myself bday gifts.
9011 2018-11-08 04:38:11 PS. the video was crucial for me to know when to pull the fried shallots and garlic from the oil at the right time. A static pic or two on the recipe would help. Also noticed the bubbling oil changed when the water finally escaped
9012 2018-11-08 04:38:06 a reminder to apply sweet almond oil under your eyes before you go to sleep 
9013 2018-11-08 04:38:00 It doesn’t get a whole lot better than this - I had a long day. I’ve been some kind of busy since 8am, whether it was dealing w/directv, cleaning house, getting oil change, taking drive test, getting license, or capping the day off with amazing fur kids & their parents.

9019 2018-11-08 04:36:28 I like roasting broccoli in the oven as well, but I add some smashed garlic cloves, olive oil and a dash of sea salt with mine.  So yummy!
9020 2018-11-08 04:36:21 Are we heading towards a new world order. -

Israel draws closer to Arab states -- without the Palestinians.

This can have great implications on the world economy. On the face of it looks like - peace at last.

It could be a case if delineating China further from oil economies.

9046 2018-11-08 04:32:05 You are truly a comedian. How on earth do you muster the guts to contest election in Delta state? I remember your Delta without oil project where you deprived the state of funds telling them to live like a state without oil while the oil money goes into your private pocket.

9054 2018-11-08 04:31:26 The problem with Nigeria : We run a mono economy dependent mainly on oil revenue, therefore necessity  is never to us a mother of invention.

9071 2018-11-08 04:29:54 Coconut oil is great, don’t get me wrong but in the winter months it tends to dry out your skin. You have to mix it with a heavier oil to hold the moisture!

9089 2018-11-08 04:26:20 Well I guess they could have remained in their tents riding camels instead. They would not have been able to get their hands on this 'nationalised' oil if it weren't for the resource pillagers. It would have remained below ground. #DumbApologistPoster

9096 2018-11-08 04:24:43 So oil and gas company’s are money grubbing capitalist entities that would do anything for a dollar - except build a pipeline. 

You don’t like pipelines, that’s fine. At least be honest about what happened.
9097 2018-11-08 04:24:42 It is when you don't try to make oil from it in your basement.

9106 2018-11-08 04:23:40 They walked back everything Trump promised on the campaign trail - first order of business was that oil pipeline with Native Americans and their land - been oil policy ever since?
9107 2018-11-08 04:23:37 Oil too cheap for every producer.  Pay me now, or pay me later. Present price of crude is like paying all interest, no principle.  Eventually, the loan comes due.
9108 2018-11-08 04:23:36 Pothead is a person who smokes weed, not an oil
9109 2018-11-08 04:23:36 Kinda sounds like “I did not have sexual relation with that woman”

Besides the actual planet becoming safer the form also can change to CBD oil, edibles with clear dosages etc.
9113 2018-11-08 04:22:51 One thing said can be interpreted in a whole other way than wht I mean on here. Tx has always been red. There are a few big liberal areas like El Paso, Houston, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, but even with those big cities the outskirts of farmland and oil fields aren’t Dem at all

9123 2018-11-08 04:21:24 So I was wondering what you think of CBD oil?
9124 2018-11-08 04:21:22 You'll never know the answer, Ken, because if it's ever put the test your lights will have gone out and your gas and heating oil will have disappeared...
9125 2018-11-08 04:21:18 I hate driving all I’ve been thinking about for the past couple of weeks now is remembering to get my tires aligned and my oil changed.
9126 2018-11-08 04:21:16 When you have a narrative, you stick to the narrative.

Rule #1 when you overthrow capitalism...
9127 2018-11-08 04:21:03 Why don’t they teach you at school,how to change the oil in your car or tire. How to vote. How to invest. How to ask for Loan. Like things we going to need one day Why do they teach us about the Pythagorean theorem. Like dad can we use to “Pythagorean theorem” to change the oil??
9128 2018-11-08 04:20:56 and we’re here not at the tax point for oil and gas activity, broadly speaking, the region would have nodded at. So I would think that 2/3

9134 2018-11-08 04:20:40 I wore my new kurta and lit 2 oil lamps. As I was going out I saw 2 verbally open Modi critics going full blast with crackers. When I asked, they said, "Modiji, thodi to Azadi do, Sanghi'ji". I smiled, left from there and caressed a frightened street dog. #ReclaimDiwali

9200 2018-11-08 04:13:01 Oil dips as soaring U.S. production outweighs talk of Sterling output cuts
9201 2018-11-08 04:13:00 Had a great day, met with two feedlot operators that are looking to use our mini turbine generators. It’s kind of nice to go back to my roots, dealing with agriculture and not thinking oil patch.

9205 2018-11-08 04:12:29 I don't think he was thinking she's inconsequential. Look how he defies the President. Not about status.
9206 2018-11-08 04:12:15 Take it easy Manyoni..hope you hoarded fuel and cooking oil for Xmas coz tese tichange tichitambura. This is because you elevated a team that doesn't deliver and that never delivered
9207 2018-11-08 04:12:02 Depending on the oil, try dawn. Hand wash the spot and scrub with a small brush (like a toothbrush). You might have to repeat this a handful of times
9208 2018-11-08 04:11:57 I need some new oils for my oil burners im thinking Amber White 
9209 2018-11-08 04:11:55 Coke is toxic and can clean the oil off your driveway. So hard pass on any coke products for me.
9210 2018-11-08 04:11:17 If you have a masters in the humanities then he!! yes someone working in say - oil fields- without a degree will earn as much or more than me. Is that right? That someone drilling for oil makes tons more than a teacher? Not IMO.
9211 2018-11-08 04:11:16 So goldfish/mosquitofish or vegetable oil/water mix spray into the rainwater tank to kill any mosquito larvae this year?
9212 2018-11-08 04:11:08 Exactly (then they hired him!). This is the same thing and about the same amount of force. Neither one should be touching anyone else. I just wish they’d be consistently outraged (or not).
9213 2018-11-08 04:11:07 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
9214 2018-11-08 04:11:06 Saudi Arabia murdered someone, I don’t give a shit. 71 people were shot in Chicago last weekend!!! 72 hours. You guys are comical Obama gives Iran 1 billion cash right before an Arab spring takes place. There economy was crashing, 90% of all money comes from oil. Oil was 100
9215 2018-11-08 04:11:04 Yes. I'm questioning the wisdom of the whole interaction. As much as I am an unmatched supporter of the President & find the media's daily hate-coverage distasteful, I don't find Acosta is the worst of the bunch. Not even close. He's just silly. Others are bitter, seething toxic.

9218 2018-11-08 04:10:30 Only at night. As an esthetician, I recommend a double or triple cleanse when wearing makeup, every night (I use miscellar water, cleansing oil, and then a cleanser), plus a toner to restore pH, but also, you need good quality makeup.
9219 2018-11-08 04:10:28 The people saying the video is faked are hilarious. Zooming in makes it fake?!?
9220 2018-11-08 04:10:16 Ok Lightly karate chopped, as she is inconsequential to him.
9221 2018-11-08 04:10:14 Not so.  If this were a woman on the left, MSM would be up in arms. It’s Acosta’s disrespectful behavior in question, not the frailty of the woman.

How many years until balance will be found?

9239 2018-11-08 04:07:22 So the government is blaming the import price as the culprit for rising oil price in the country, not the excise tax.

9253 2018-11-08 04:05:29 Yeah that’s the point I’m conveying. Lmao Why go through the hastle when for a few bucks more you can sit back and watch somebody that does oil changes for a living do it and usually check mounts and grease fittings while they’re at it?
9254 2018-11-08 04:05:19 I felt the burning oil and cheese on that last one ruin a white t shirt on top of that burn!

9259 2018-11-08 04:04:53 Not when you consider the ongoing dismissal of native rights and casual racism still endemic in US eg oil pipelines forced through native lands, often endangeing water supplies and causing pollution as all pipelines leak.

9265 2018-11-08 04:03:36 One good thing about Democrats taking the House: the Science Committee will no longer be run by rabid global warming deniers whose main constituency is the oil industry.

9268 2018-11-08 04:03:25 Africa’s share of global oil production has slightly increased by 0.3 per cent since last year to 8.7 per cent standing at 8.1 mn bbl/d. The main contributors continue to be Nigeria, Angola, Algeria and Egypt.
9269 2018-11-08 04:03:23 Politics and I would be like oil and water. That and I love to swear.  A lot.
9270 2018-11-08 04:03:20 A 'Kafir' shouldn't be President, yet parasites can't do without the oil that God in his wisdom and bounty planted on the land of 'Kafirs'. Yet, once 'Kafirs' threaten to break away, parasites start to urinate in their panties. Isn't that hypocrisy?

9278 2018-11-08 04:02:43 Ah the famous Rose corn oil study. Should have stopped the use of vegetable oil in its tracks... Many decades ago.
9279 2018-11-08 04:02:26 No, clearly in a humanitarian way - not! Actually when we’re not spying on them so e can pinch their oil

9282 2018-11-08 04:01:55 Yeah, OK. Charges can be filed. Prove to me that someone serves time or pays a huge fine for barely making contact with someone else in a non-aggressive manner. He was being rude, sure. That wasn't aggression. Maybe towards Trump, but not towards the campaign girl.
9283 2018-11-08 04:01:43 It was offensive contact. Meets legal standard of assault. It would hold in court. I personally don’t think it was a big deal, but denying it occurred is outlandish.
9284 2018-11-08 04:01:40 Only thing I know about this Acosta guy is Trumpkins are constantly crying about him on Twitter. I watched the video and the woman was yanking the mic out of his hand, his physical reaction was simple, minor and normal... she'll live, I promise.....
9285 2018-11-08 04:01:38 Really not about to be that guy who tells people that law school is such an impossible mission that you have better luck trying to mix oil and water like my seniors did. All they did was ever tell how hard it was and just never say anything positive.

9289 2018-11-08 04:01:22 I had a dream last night I put a lot of coconut oil in my hair and it just instantly started locking up... then there was this long piece in the back (like down to elbow long) it scared me tho like what???
9290 2018-11-08 04:01:22 Just find one leader who has dealt US on his own terms which includes oil import from Iran Chabhar port or buying arms from Russia. @narendramodi has kept the nation interns above all and it’s his diplomacy that US has exempted India from the sanction list . Wake up and think.

9296 2018-11-08 04:00:30 MCT oil is a medium chain triglyceride.  It’s drawn from the coconut.  This actually increases the ketones in your blood which induces ketosis to eat your body’s fat.  It also stabilized blood sugar levels and increases energy.  I’m really into this shit as you see lol
9297 2018-11-08 04:00:28 don’t use witch hazel on ur face beauty!!! herbivore products have helped clear my skin up especially the lapis oil, prism oil, blue tansy mask, and moonfruit moisturizer.
9298 2018-11-08 04:00:18 I just find the word "bat" makes it sound worse than it was. I saw what happened.

People become so judgmental on every issue of human behavior that I really wonder who and how the perfect people I've never met, are.
9299 2018-11-08 04:00:15 I personally don’t believe it was assault but in many legal definitions assault can be unwanted touching.  True story bro.

9308 2018-11-08 03:59:16 Idk why but I started using coconut oil on my face and that shit evened my skin tone and cleared my skin. I’m not listening to people anymore.

9314 2018-11-08 03:58:50 Yes - we got SO MUCH oil over that! NOT! We didn't get a drop. Personally I believe Bush (who I didn't vote for) just knocked that country over because Hussein tried to have his father killed.
9315 2018-11-08 03:58:50 That’s not necessarily an either or scenario...
9316 2018-11-08 03:58:46 Technically, he seems to have karate-chopped that woman. He must have thought he had to do it in order to make the issue about himself. He’s been trying to get chucked out of the press pool for two years. He must have been getting desperate. Congrat, Jim.
9317 2018-11-08 03:58:46 Idiot what we lit up during our festivals is not wax candles we lit  'Diya' which does not use wax instead it uses oil.
9318 2018-11-08 03:58:43 And just so we are clear, when he says "literally" he doesn't mean like "Trump is literally Hitler", instead he means "Hitler is literally Hitler".
9319 2018-11-08 03:58:35 500 gallon oil tank. Before and after.
9320 2018-11-08 03:58:31 I need an oil change but I’m really not tryna pay it for 
9321 2018-11-08 03:58:21 Nope.  Butter is much better for you than margarine.  It’s natural milk fat.  Nothing wrong with milk fat.  Oil is obviously better for you like olive oil.  I use coconut oil now and put a tablespoon of MCT oil in my protein shake every day.

9326 2018-11-08 03:57:57 @Walmart Luckily, @FirestoneAuto was willing to put customer safety above closing on time, found the nail in my sidewall & put on my spare tire for free. I've spent my last dollar on tires or oil changes in your auto center. @FirestoneAuto gets my business now. 2/2
9327 2018-11-08 03:57:52 Swatted? Oh come on will had he exerted as much effort on you your arm wouldn’t have even moved. He exerted so little force that to call it swatting is like saying throwing a cotton ball at a fly is also swatting a fly.

9331 2018-11-08 03:56:54 Pretty mobby.
9332 2018-11-08 03:56:52 Lol must be some kind of leverage the way Trump's been sanctioning Russia and telling Germany not to buy Russia's oil but to buy from us.
Now does that really sound like they have leverage over Trump?

9337 2018-11-08 03:56:08 @India_Yamaha Even for a simple repair like changing fork oil the service center is requesting to keep the bike from morning 9 o'clock till evening. Also for repair when we go to svc after 9 they tell us to come tomorrow.

9340 2018-11-08 03:55:50 Soros, Blomberg, Steyer and Hollywood paid more than $20 for each vote Beteaux got.  The lesson is if you want to buy an election in Texas it will cost a whole lot more than that.  Between oil and high tech $100million won't buy what it used to. Not in Texas.

9346 2018-11-08 03:55:03 I'm with you, would have been ok with no penalty on the play at all. Oshie initiated the contact and essentially put his head down towards Malkin's arm. Also, watching it in slow motion makes it look far worse.
9347 2018-11-08 03:54:32 i use tea tree oil on my keloids and it works pretty well! my conch isn't sensitive anymore

9350 2018-11-08 03:54:18 well cost the same as 2 packs of the 40s ... you best buy everything from NZ as you have to import nicotine oil ... but after that its a dollar a day ... like being back in the 70s lol i just payed 85 dollars for e smoke and oil that will last 30 days then its like 30 bills a mth
9351 2018-11-08 03:54:17 Nuclear Power is a good example. Nuclear Fission is some 8,000x more efficient than fossil fuels. America could rely on its own nuclear plants rather than buying oil from foreign entities, funding their undemocratic or tyrannical govts. Less foreign military presence required.

9360 2018-11-08 03:52:58 Can't we all just say he didnt assault her but he did act like a jerk. It's not that hard.
9361 2018-11-08 03:52:56 Everyone had changed. The faces, the oil paintings, the help.. returning to Upperton was like finishing a book you started years before but never finished; you may know of the people, the place, but it’s all blurred and her vague memories had to fill in the missing gaps. 

She —
9362 2018-11-08 03:52:54 it was for a photoshoot  they were putting oil on him to make him look shiny LMAO
9363 2018-11-08 03:52:52 I agree carbon taxes are nice to have, but only because they hurt oil companies. The one thing each of the “yes and” solutions have in common is that they hurt oil companies. Where they differ is the ratio of oil company pain to voter pain. The higher the ratio the better.
9364 2018-11-08 03:52:51 Acosta has been “credibly accused.”

9373 2018-11-08 03:51:52 More than almost any other religion, worshiping Jews in diaspora are hugely diverse.  I don't think they'll welcome stringent control from Israel or to give settlement rights & rename West Bank.  This pertains to PapaD & Gaza territorial gas/oil rights too. Israel chose theocracy

9377 2018-11-08 03:51:12 And China’s main oil company wants all the oil they can get from as they own part of our oil patch so once again @MikeHudema your full of shit

9382 2018-11-08 03:51:00 Little B and Big F help change the world! Congressional investigations will shed light on the big orange windbag.

9390 2018-11-08 03:50:07 Judging from the picture you’re taking 3 dollar bribes now, seems kind of cheap. If that’s all Big Oil, Big Pharma, insurance companies and the financial industry are giving you you’re sure being underpaid. Come over to our side and we’ll set up a GoFundMe or something.

9394 2018-11-08 03:49:31 I have dry patches/eczema under both of my eyes for the first time in my life and I’m suffering badly. I’m currently doing a face mask and gonna follow it up with Purlisse balancing moisturizer and a face oil blend. Skipping my eye cream tonight to lessen irritation.

9397 2018-11-08 03:49:05 stems of the catnip plant contain an oil called "nepetalactone." When cats smell nepetalactone, it stimulates special receptors that sense chemicals called "pheromones." The result is a kind of chemical reaction that gives the cat a sense of euphoria or overwhelming happiness.
9398 2018-11-08 03:49:05 even olbas oil isnt clearing my STUPIT NOSE
9399 2018-11-08 03:49:01 Also - and this will blow your mind - butter and coconut oil cost at least 2 or 3 times as much as "heart healthy" refined seed oils already - the equivalent of a much larger "saturated fat tax" than any politician could impose.
9400 2018-11-08 03:49:00 Dude. Eminence Facial Recovery Oil. We sell it at my salon! @ShannonASalon  the entire line is the absolute bomb, but you will love the results! Tell them I sent you, you’ll get 20% off

9402 2018-11-08 03:48:36 I had one way back in the 70s, flatbed with oil barrels on it, years later I stepped on one of the barrels and broke it, it had actual oil in it
9403 2018-11-08 03:48:27 Your oil portraits are gorgeous it would be cool to see how your style translates to something as flat as gouache.

9464 2018-11-08 03:40:16 Right my Vaporizer arrived from NZ with oil that has nicotine in it 
just tried for the first time
I think this might work  oil don't taste like smokes thow but smoke has nicotine in it and feels like smoking
9465 2018-11-08 03:40:06 It's like the butter upcharge at the movie theatre. You can get the weird yellow "buttery" oil for free, but for the real stuff it's $0.89 per layer. (I gladly pay for 2 layers every time, even on a small popcorn.)

9472 2018-11-08 03:39:16 Me and my 3 daughters just anointed our foreheads with oil got down on our knees to pray for @AndrewGillum victory. I know in my heart Dade and Broward Counties are missing votes.. #RECOUNTFLORIDA #RecountForGillum definitely thousands of uncounted mail ballots

“Modern conservatives re-concoct a new reality for themselves every day. It’s not horse-trading when the other side is offering unicorns.”
9474 2018-11-08 03:39:10 But their stance toward him isn't toward a snake oil salesman. They're not cautious and adversarial. They think he truly represents their best interests. Is the idea: "He lies all the time, but not about what matters, and not to us"?
9475 2018-11-08 03:38:37 @atiku and his team left no footprint we could point to today. They just had d good fortune of a steadily increasing oil price n a buoyant global economy that allowed us to enjoy d crumbs of a seemingly prosperity that had no economic foundation on reality......
9476 2018-11-08 03:38:36 James 5:14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
9477 2018-11-08 03:38:29 Not likely. What’s happening right now is all the big institutional buyers are getting in right now. With the sessions news in US this stock is the #1 cannabis stock to buy. Weed only moves down when oil cycle goes down btw.
9478 2018-11-08 03:38:25 How much is the Rso oil cost / gram ?
Potency % thc ?
9479 2018-11-08 03:38:25 The key driver behind #oil prices shifted from a fear of global supply shortage to slower global demand and a potential oversupply from the US. The inflection point of oil prices may appear if a higher risk appetite or investor buying extends to oil markets
9480 2018-11-08 03:38:21 I just got a 2016 Chevy Cruze to find out it needs the oil pan replaced so now I’m driving a 2019 Chevy Traverse..... what is life right now

9486 2018-11-08 03:37:45 Yes! Or olive oil. Something special to get us through the winter.

9489 2018-11-08 03:37:23 Oil is the messiest and smelliest and stainyist and takes the longest to dry and is the most expensive however it’s easier to manipulate and mix and layer lol and it doesn’t dry when you’re trying to use it

9496 2018-11-08 03:35:46 It is vote buying because it benefits the poor people on the street who have not benefited anything from the government. If it is allocation of oil well to the rich it becomes growing of the economy. If this is vote buying like PDP said pls APC keep buying we like it

9509 2018-11-08 03:33:55 Clever analogy. But if you're cutting off New Orleans- a solid, deeply blue island in an otherwise red state- do we get the  back oil lease revenues we've been getting screwed out of for decades by the federal govt? I mean, the rest of the country DOES like oil, right?

9521 2018-11-08 03:31:49 Wow many ACs you use at home or office? Does it help environment. Lighting of Devas with mustard oil does not damage environment. Why the way have you stopped burning crackers on New Year Day?

9532 2018-11-08 03:30:35 So did they leave a sack of feces that they all took a dump in and set it on fire, rang the doorbell one last time and ran off? Because that is the level we are at now.

9536 2018-11-08 03:30:05 Green tech—no one is oppressing green tech. Gas and oil are big industries , you want to abolish them? We can’t live the life we live without fossil fuel. Think beyond gas for your car, or heat for your home. What else do we use it for? PLASTIC, which almost all tech is made from
9537 2018-11-08 03:30:02 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Please share to @vancouverpride why you want the world to buy #bloodoil  obstructing Trans Mountain = killing #LGBTQ
9538 2018-11-08 03:30:01 why does looking at animals covered in oil make me sad, but looking at animals covered in oil and deep-fried make me hungry?
9539 2018-11-08 03:29:50 The video shows he made a DELIBERATE,  aggressive move to stop her. That makes it INEXCUSABLE. He crossed a line that cannot be ignored!

9548 2018-11-08 03:28:44 Zero point is NOW. No reason to burn oil at all. 
9549 2018-11-08 03:28:42 That's a great point I am not familiar with it enough to know if tolerance develops  I've heard many with Fibro say that CBD oil and whole plant use helps them. I agree it would be great if so! Maybe it will reduce or eliminate the use of harsh medications & their side effects.

9552 2018-11-08 03:28:22 TBH I expected worse & it might yet happen. They want impeachment. 

It was lose-lose situation. Blue wave, would have staged effectively a coup, & would have continued provoking until CW. Red wave, then color revolution, coup, CW.

9555 2018-11-08 03:27:48 What I do by steps btw it works for me
1. Wash face with Dawn dish soap. "Because it drys out all the oils"
2. Apply coconut oil on your face before bed "This should help because it keeps your face moisturized and fills your pores with clean good oil"
9556 2018-11-08 03:27:43 I cooked! One-pan chicken thighs in a mushroom cream sauce with white wine, wild rice pilaf with shallots & garlic, and roast green beans in truffle oil. #dinner #dinnertonight Amazing!

9562 2018-11-08 03:26:51 The Nats have certainly been captured by the oil industry and they’re against the majority of the population! Nats burn, oil industry burn, the world dies at their hands.
9563 2018-11-08 03:26:36 Let’s see who wins this production BS lol. My money is on CNRL and Suncor can eat bitumen pucks  $44 cheaper than real oil save it for when the Chinese will pay you less 
9564 2018-11-08 03:26:13 You can not force someone on the people around you. It's like mixing oil and water . Once someone feels your forcing someone on them at that moment they don't even wanna get to know the person because they overstayed their welcome .
9565 2018-11-08 03:26:13 Theyve just convinced themselves, not incorrectly, that all politicians lie so they'd rather feel like they're in on it, and he gives them that. Obama's style lying was very wizard of Oz and made people paranoid. Trump is selling snake oil: you know but at least it's up front.

9568 2018-11-08 03:25:31 Edmonton green onion cakes are dense and flat and full of butter/oil and green onions. I don't like the ones that are puffy and deep fried.
9569 2018-11-08 03:25:27 Do something right before ur out of office.  U've made enough bad decisions.  U've led a state w/ the highest incarceration rate in the nation.  Try to do something good for people for a change.  U've treated people outside of oil companies HORRIBLY & shd be ashamed.  Sayonara.
9570 2018-11-08 03:25:21 You can literally do anything with it! My husband makes chicken in it, you can put baked goods in it, like…we use it everyday. You get the same crispness without the oil
9571 2018-11-08 03:25:11 The only thing less popular than taxes is oil companies. Voters could get behind a promise to put an oil company out of business, because it would hurt the oil company more than the consumer. Pain, like wealth, is relative. If oil companies are hurting, voters will feel empowered

9575 2018-11-08 03:24:44 If you like food, I think olive oil is a good (better) investment. My family is Italian so I’m obligated to have some wine rip lol. I don’t really drink otherwise though haha
9576 2018-11-08 03:24:19 0.5oz zinc oxide equal to 10spf. U want more spf, add coconut oil. Coconut oil does blocked 20% of Uv ray. Mau lagi, tambah lg minyak yg ada natural spf. gitu.

9580 2018-11-08 03:23:48 I’ve changed my oil before, but I rather go to oil stop and pay the money for it. It’s usually like 15 dollars more than if I were to buy everything my self but I get to sit I. My car while they do it so it’s worth it to me
9581 2018-11-08 03:23:46 ...y’all come from urban areas or even out of state and out of the country to do ur oil work. Those people in the oilfield aren’t locals 
9582 2018-11-08 03:23:44 Just now realized that tweet made zero sense. Scrub it with salt. After it’s clean. Put oil in it in high heat. reseasoning.  That’s all!
9583 2018-11-08 03:23:35 Should I get my hair done or get an oil change?

9592 2018-11-08 03:22:17 I thought my night was pretty great until I watched Ryan Blaney’s Instagram story. I changed the oil in my car, got to throttle a few BMW M cars (the M6 and the M2 are the best). He is eating pizza with Bill Elliot. Somehow that’s way cooler than driving some cars.

9603 2018-11-08 03:20:42 About as long as PM took to ban the oil and gas
9604 2018-11-08 03:20:33 I invest in good olive oil.

9607 2018-11-08 03:20:27 As I lay here filled with dread at the cost my health care will be after I mend enough to go home I really am of a mind that most people that support Trump are the same type that use to give their money to snake oil salesmen & fake rain makers of olden times.
9608 2018-11-08 03:20:21 Lmao either way I wish I could get my oil changed for free teach me and bro your ways lol
9609 2018-11-08 03:20:02 Let's say I had a cookie couple days ago prepared with a certain oil. Helps my arthritis. Hour later I could have done classic Cheech & Chong. BTW helped arthritis!
9610 2018-11-08 03:19:33 I have more olive oil than I do wine.
9611 2018-11-08 03:19:21 Well, when the Quran was written, mopeds roamed freely upon the African tundra. It is how the discovered oil. Without the mighty moped, there woukd be no OPEC.

9619 2018-11-08 03:16:59 Chef Louis cut up some rotten zucchini, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with Play-Doh.

9621 2018-11-08 03:16:49 When used in this type of context “put his hands on her” is usually taken to mean intentionally inflicted physical harm in some way. This was clearly incidental contact for which both Acosta and the aide share some responsibility

9625 2018-11-08 03:16:00 My anxiety is through the fucking roof right now and I have no more freaking oil for my vape pen. I’m gonna fucking lose it like a crazy lady tonight probably. Stay tuned.

9627 2018-11-08 03:15:52 Broccolini is better...sautéed in olive oil with finely sliced garlic.
9628 2018-11-08 03:15:48 Diluted tea tree oil or frankincense oil. Benzoyl peroxide and  salicylic acid have both caused issues for me. Should I try a retinoid?
9629 2018-11-08 03:15:47 I used coconut oil on it and baked it and did it again to season it . It made a dam good bond for non stick . For maintenance I use olive oil
9630 2018-11-08 03:15:46 Mix 2 tablespoons hot dogs with 3 cups jelly / jam. Mix in Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve with a nice chianti.
9631 2018-11-08 03:15:43 CO Rising also said that the estimated job losses from 112 were overstated, because not that many people work in oil and gas. But now you’re marginalizing the 64,417 “No” votes in Weld Co because O&G workers and paid elected officials mostly live there? Which one is it?
9632 2018-11-08 03:15:37 why every time i talk to anybody in my family they ask if i’ve gotten my oil changed.. the answer is no but still leave me alone

9640 2018-11-08 03:14:24 @TunDrMahathir please take care our young engineers in oil & gas sector..They are being discriminate in our own country. We are treated as a coolie in our own land but yet they the foreigners get big chunk despite we are doing almost all the job...thx for your consideration....
9641 2018-11-08 03:14:22 I got mad shit in the crib I have natural hair sisters. lmao, I really wanted the whole setup, the oil and balm, and comb are a little more specific.

Watercolor and oil paint can suck my ass but maybe I'll give watercolor a second try who knows.

9657 2018-11-08 03:12:56 In an essential oil diffuser?
9658 2018-11-08 03:12:53 Castor oil da? Hhhaahahahah
9659 2018-11-08 03:12:50 Allergic to castor oil
9660 2018-11-08 03:12:42 theres this no. that keeps calling me so i googled just incase and its some essential oil company simi ?? ?
9661 2018-11-08 03:12:39 vitamin c oil, tea tree oil, turmeric, aztec clay mask, sunscreen will help prevent
9662 2018-11-08 03:12:35 Show the results a month from now because I swear castor oil works just the same.
9663 2018-11-08 03:12:32 This is not Modi diplomacy but exemptions given to maintain oil price index. Stop spreading #fake news. Modi and diplomacy - India wants to see the.list.
9664 2018-11-08 03:12:30 I want the pen or some oil for after my baseball games I stay sore all week so I want to try it
9665 2018-11-08 03:12:28 I had a bump too for a while then I read somewhere to use tea tree oil on it and it worked I haven’t had any problems since then. I just wet the q-tip then put a couple drops of tea tree oil on it and put it all over the bump like 2-3 times a day until it went away.
9666 2018-11-08 03:12:25 Better than, “whack”.
9667 2018-11-08 03:12:07 My advice. When the cast iron cooking is done: pour some kosher salt in it to scrub. Scrub it. Out it I t he drive again.  Heat up a bit and pour oil in it.
9668 2018-11-08 03:12:00 My styrofoam got more oil than Dubai
9669 2018-11-08 03:11:57 I want a dude to oil and massage my scalp
9670 2018-11-08 03:11:42 Obama's claim to his great economy was driven by the oil boom that he & Democrats tried to squelch. State fracking & pre-Obama oil leases offshore, north Dakota, Texas, Pennsylvania & other red states prospered thereby creating most of any economic advances of his tenure.
9671 2018-11-08 03:11:40 It is interesting then that Weld County, with the most oil and gas, has lower cancer incident rates per 100,000 people than Denver, with no oil and gas. Rates are also stable, despite O&G production increasing 400% since 2013.
9672 2018-11-08 03:11:32 Just read that the Statue was funded by Public Sector Oil corporations. Really sad move considering we're already bleeding for oil and petrol. If nothing else, this money would have helped the employers of these companies.
9673 2018-11-08 03:11:11 I use oil to seal in moisture every time or it’ll never lock in. I have normal skin now actually. Use to be oily but once I added the hyaluronic acid to my routine my oil production leveled
9674 2018-11-08 03:11:09 If it wasn't for my condition I'd be camped out with the ghosts of the music group Midnight Oil at the headquarters of Exxon (Except that Peter Garrett and co. are still around). I remember 1990 as if it were yesterday for that protest.
9675 2018-11-08 03:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: spicy crust with greasy coconut oil and pulled pork.
9676 2018-11-08 03:11:04 The greatest asset, even in this country, is not oil and gas. It's integrity. Everyone is searching for it, asking, 'Who can I do business with that I can trust?' (George Foreman)
9677 2018-11-08 03:10:53 I’m obsessed with cuticle oil.  K bye.
9678 2018-11-08 03:10:35 Thank you! Please keep putting this information out there. The fear these companies instill in people,  especially employees, is ridiculous. There is life and prosperity outside of the oil and gas industry. The power of these bullies has to be diminished.
9679 2018-11-08 03:10:34 Yup with big oil stain.  Turning Texas into a trash can.
9680 2018-11-08 03:10:28 The press pool needs to grow a collective pair & stop giving oxygen to this contemptible reality show. The entire news conference today was absolutely disgusting. Stop ENABLING the snake oil salesman. @CNN @MSNBC @ABC @CBS @NBC @PBS
9681 2018-11-08 03:10:28 マテウスーマテウスー飲みにいこーぜー
9682 2018-11-08 03:10:12 Yeah, until you see @Cernovich freaking out on people because they cancelled his venue. He's a snake oil salesman.
9683 2018-11-08 03:09:46 I’ve been putting castor oil on my lashes and brows, apparently it really helps them grow fast. Not sold on this yet though because the oil feels so thick
9684 2018-11-08 03:09:45 we’re in line @ costco & rhilee saw the avocado oil in the cart & just asked to tap the bottle 
9685 2018-11-08 03:09:44 Dollar rose oil dropped . You guys also didn’t hesitate to raise petrol and when oil dropped to 30 bucks a barrel it didn’t change at the pump you guys creamed it just quietly .
9686 2018-11-08 03:09:34 . They already talk some different language. Did you know “are you getting an oil change?”  Means getting drugs outta system. 
9687 2018-11-08 03:09:32 In the 80s tanning was mandatory. We used baby oil! But any white girl still think it's cool after knowing it pretty much guarantees skin cancer is stupid af. I'm just glad more women liking their natural skin instead of feeling ugly for being pale like I did. Natural brown rocks

9689 2018-11-08 03:09:17 Will, aside from getting trained to fight, by any chance do you do any "prepping"? I agree that it's going to get bad, tho these snotty-nosed punks are least of our concerns. Something worse coming down pipeline.
9690 2018-11-08 03:09:05 me and kassidy literally waited so long to get an oil change that the car just broke
9691 2018-11-08 03:08:49 The rest of the league has been put on notice, dont fuck around and do dirty shit against the Oil, cuz Lucic is all out of fucks to give.
9692 2018-11-08 03:08:25 I’ll probably slide and fall with all that oil, then I’ll sued for physical and emotional damages. I’m just going to like your tweet.
9693 2018-11-08 03:08:24 The challenge for Nigeria is demographics. 4 million children added every single year, 16 million during the disastrous administration of @mbuhari and @profosinbajo. Nigeria either restructures government away from petroluem revenue or collapses in the next oil bust.
9694 2018-11-08 03:08:16 The steam heats the bitumen or heavy oil to make it flow . The steam turns to water and because it is in contact with the hot oil, absorbs chemicals from it. The steam condenses; goes either into rivers as run off or into underground aquifers, the source drinking water wells.
9695 2018-11-08 03:07:57 By cooking e.g "Cooking Oil "
9696 2018-11-08 03:07:50 I use a lot of argon oil shampoos and such. I can send you an indie brand that’s sulfate free, and it’s afordable from Walmart.
9697 2018-11-08 03:07:50 "a worldwide slump in oil prices had led to the astonishing election of Rachel Notley’s NDP."

You casually ignore the cons having 40 yrs of power and NOTHING to show for it. "Heritage fund? Bah, we have rich friends to give tax breaks too. Look in a mirror" Prentice told us.

9699 2018-11-08 03:07:43 Conventional oil has peaked
9700 2018-11-08 03:07:35 Agree. Wouldn’t it be great if WHpress in solidarity skipped the press conferences a while and reported on DOJ horrors, voter suppression, right wing militia at the border, emoluments & deals with Saudis and China for family profit, federal land giveaways to oil and gas etc etc
9701 2018-11-08 03:07:21 She looks to POTUS for help.  That “reporter” what a dck
9702 2018-11-08 03:07:12 Turn on the sprinklers. Get out the paint ball gun. Have fun.
9703 2018-11-08 03:07:00 Ahem. Paid oil and gas workers and paid elected officials mostly live in Weld county.  Don’t fool yourselves. Greeley school district voted for 2,000 foot setbacks. Don’t forget the top leading health issues in Weld county too. Cancer is at the top. #benzene #respiratoryissues
9704 2018-11-08 03:06:59 Good one 
9705 2018-11-08 03:06:44 Can’t wait to treat my baby to an oil change and a good car wash this weekend, I’ve been neglecting her
9706 2018-11-08 03:06:41 I've always wondered why not be conservative with the oil revenues expected.  So many times additional deficits have beenncreared by spending based on inflated expected oil revenues
9707 2018-11-08 03:06:40 report them. Force @TwitterSupport to act on this garbage
9708 2018-11-08 03:06:33 I wish I could just drown myself in peppermint oil. So good for a stuffy nose.
9709 2018-11-08 03:06:32 The gas used in the oil sands has NOTHING to do with the pipeline in BC or natural gas prices in Vancouver...
9710 2018-11-08 03:06:28 I love my essential/natural oil blend that I use on my scalp. It’s good for skin also.
9711 2018-11-08 03:06:24 I know I'm late but oil pens r good stuff.

9714 2018-11-08 03:06:19 Just started shooting again. Glad I did.
9715 2018-11-08 03:06:12 Shoutout to baby girl @blondeandposi for telling about coconut oil for scarring; I’ve actually gone out to work and ran errands without makeup on the other day. You’re a lifesaver.
9716 2018-11-08 03:06:12 I have no idea. Chill tonic? Probably snake oil
9717 2018-11-08 03:05:50 Okay
1. These people are gross 
2. My mom lowkey accidentally got this tan on half of her body when she fell asleep outside for 12 hours with baby oil on her skin and she looked like a fucking leather couch
9718 2018-11-08 03:05:42 boy. lol not only would I walk out w a free oil change, but my next three would b on the house as well
9719 2018-11-08 03:05:34 Especially if you buy a monthly because that’s cheaper than an oil change 
9720 2018-11-08 03:05:27 They're good at some things and then fruit it with much bigger worser things! If only they respected the scientists who provide them with computers aeroplanes rockets but they suggest oil is harmful suddenly science "ain't worth a damn" little convenient isn't it?
9721 2018-11-08 03:05:27 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Please share to @vancouverpride why you want the world to buy #bloodoil  obstructing Trans Mountain = killing #LGBTQ
9722 2018-11-08 03:05:12 Total LIE!  @SHSanders45. Should be fried.   Literally.  No oil needed. U dont need grease to fry bacon.

 Even my Bush-voting buddy, who works in the oil industry no less, is giving O'Rourke a vote. "Republicans have too much power for their own good,"

9743 2018-11-08 03:02:39 Only God knows who many Billings was just your shares? Because of oil. Destroyed Libi & Libian's ppl life. Just for your games. That money you all got by murdering ppl is blood money. Hope never enjoy it. I had a classmate from Libey. Gaddafi himself was working on the farm.
9744 2018-11-08 03:02:28 Actly brands like Lurpark actly incorporate grapeseed oil (healthier) into their butter to make it more spreadable. And I think the lighter taste might come from whipping the lipid to incorporate air - gives a mouth coating feel. Moderation I thk cus we still need fats!

9746 2018-11-08 03:02:20 True!  Because those roughnecks in those oil fields and coal mines aren’t of the feminine persuasion. 
9747 2018-11-08 03:02:00 I think people like you are only throwing oil into the fire. Maybe you should search where all this negativity inside you is coming from

9751 2018-11-08 03:01:30 There must be an end to this torture/cruelty/murder. These gorgeous animals die HORRENDOUS deaths for snake oil type bullshit that ppl lie about being medication. And the ones selling/ buying this shit are just as bad as the murderers bc hey are the reason this lie continues.
9752 2018-11-08 03:01:26 Don't worry, we'll hit Peak Oil sometime before 1978.
But there is light in the tunnel ahead -- good news for the global economy, the U.S. will be fully converted to the metric system by the mid 1980's!
9753 2018-11-08 03:01:19 This is not hard. Leave the oil in the ground and use sources of energy that are sustainable. Dismantle oil & gas infrastructure.
9754 2018-11-08 03:01:15 Some people used like Jade and derma rollers depending on what they need for their skin, oil cleanse before actually cleaning, serum, masks. All type of things.
9755 2018-11-08 03:01:15 Okay TX, we get it.  You still want to secede from the union.  I just hope Pres. Cruz can save you when the rest of the states remember how much oil you still have.

9794 2018-11-08 02:56:30 So Tom has already set the avg price higher than it currently sits...i guess wishful thinking comes into play.  The almighty oil will continue to deceive people into thinking they are actually contributing to deficit reduction by their actions.  What a joke

9801 2018-11-08 02:55:43 Essential oil frequency varies directly with each organ & body part frequency, as like frequency of oil attracts a like body frequency. 
Lower frequencies sponge negative energy as the frequency stays in the body to maintain the longer lasting effects of the oil.

9806 2018-11-08 02:54:49 All these people defending paying for an oil change just don’t get it. Haha. Maybe some people actually enjoy changing it. I’d say most gear heads do. I personally look forward to changing my oil.

9846 2018-11-08 02:48:53 The only thing absurd is the statement that he didn’t touch her when his hand goes down and pushes her arm down and he says something to her. In basketball this is done with the off hand to keep the opponent from getting to the ball - he was clearly trying to keep her away.

9852 2018-11-08 02:48:19 As well, I see this as compounded by a systemic geopolitical event that transpired earlier this year.  The event has remained suppressed since then but it is finally displaying a material affect, albeit indirectly, on crude oil markets (and other asset classes to a lesser degree)

9882 2018-11-08 02:44:34 What a great productive day. I basically got everything done. Hit the gym for 2hrs, got groceries, reserved my room at vegas, made ugly looking but delicious pancakes, changed my own oil, installed a new license plate while rotating my tires and finally made dinner. 
Magnifique.
9883 2018-11-08 02:44:34 Black girls are going blonde and bleaching their skin and white girls are using oil colored spray tans and weaving in their braids and afros lol. The FUCK is going on?

9885 2018-11-08 02:44:25 Anyone else have roommates that somehow GET SPRAY OIL ALL OVER THE CAN? LIKE YOU SPRAY THE PAN HOW YOU SPRAY THE CAN
9886 2018-11-08 02:44:24 Palm oil is in so many prepared foods, Read labels. No palm oil, no enzymes- so many vegetarians don't know that most of cheeses & yogurt & more contain animal enzymes from the stomachs of dead animals that is unacceptable that they do not know this.

9893 2018-11-08 02:43:24 Yes they did, even told us it was because of the left engine. Told us to calm down, that they are trained for this.  felt the @RoyalBruneiAir pilots and crew did a good job being transparent & reassuring us. Yatah semua nda begarak atu takut.... When they said it was oil leak.
9894 2018-11-08 02:43:21 Coconut oil has to be one of my favorite oils to use on my face & hair
9895 2018-11-08 02:43:05 Oh trueee get you some castor oil my friend 
9896 2018-11-08 02:43:04 Not true. 80% do not live in poverty . Where did you get this from
9897 2018-11-08 02:42:56 Whatever you say, cupcake.
9898 2018-11-08 02:42:51 I think when they predict the price of oil in the budget they use 
9899 2018-11-08 02:42:50 Coconut oil. Learnt this hack in Singapore
9900 2018-11-08 02:42:46 @Acosta Not only did  he disrupt a Presidential Press Conference.  He should  now apologize to that young in turn ... “he didn’t touch”. Oh wait he did!!!!!!
9901 2018-11-08 02:42:41 everyone’s skin is different, do you know your skin type ?? My skincare routine is pretty simple, cleanser, toner, serum/essence, and lastly moisturizer (though I mix rose hip oil and my moisturizer together and it does wonders) + I also exfoliate 2-3 times a week !
9902 2018-11-08 02:42:33 I started adding a lil bit of rosehip oil to my bentonite clay mask mix and it made a huge difference, it don’t feel as tight or itchy and my face don’t be dry afterwards
9903 2018-11-08 02:42:32 Anyone knows what black seed oil is? No?  Just me?
9904 2018-11-08 02:42:09 The coconut oil nair is the best thing ever
9905 2018-11-08 02:42:00 So real question, what does cbd oil do for your hair? I’ve never heard of that before. Very interested though
9906 2018-11-08 02:41:52 Triangles! Everywhere there’s triangles!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
9907 2018-11-08 02:41:39 Oil and Gas in Taranaki?  @JudithCollinsMP
9908 2018-11-08 02:41:34 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
9909 2018-11-08 02:41:22 Uh yea, there’s a lot more than just that one dude. There’s the banks, Wall St, the Military Industrial Complex, Big Pharm/Health Insurance, Big Oil, I cud go on for days & they all gave to Cruz’s campaign.
9910 2018-11-08 02:41:17 i’ll just only have my oil changes at my dealership.
9911 2018-11-08 02:41:15 Bush Sr started it and All the presidents after kept it going cause a lot of Halliburton oil wells which were owned by Bushes VP company. Lots of Money goes into those pockets in DC. They won't stop doing anything that makes them money.

9914 2018-11-08 02:40:57 Is forehead oil essential?
9915 2018-11-08 02:40:53 おっはこんにちはーー
空気が乾燥してますね、水分補給＆潤い補給、それから一休みもお忘れなく〜(✿’v｀)ﾉ
9916 2018-11-08 02:40:47 Same thing as before. I did everything possible mechanically that I know of that would fix a misfire. It’s leaking oil from somewhere and I’m not certain where it is. The problem has gotten far worse where I’m getting almost ZERO combustion in all cylinders.
9917 2018-11-08 02:40:30 Or sliced raw and dipped in peppered vinegar and oil...
9918 2018-11-08 02:40:27 I got 2 free stocks from using a friend’s code signing up and from also referring a friend. I got sprint and some oil company but I’m investing my own money into medical marijuana

9920 2018-11-08 02:40:05 Well, ok, if you think a debilitating karate chop to the arm is funny.
9921 2018-11-08 02:39:55 Even with high tax, oil companies would still produce, and someone would hoard until the tax went down again. Infinite tax is just prohibition, but if oil companies still produce, prohibition won’t work. Reduce production by taking away an oil company’s business privilege.
9922 2018-11-08 02:39:49 Mr. Acosta,  we did watch the video.  She grabbed at the mic you were holding and the most you did was put a hand up in her way.  Most of us are able to tell the difference.  Those that can't,  well they are all still waiting for the snake oil salesman to cure their stupid.
9923 2018-11-08 02:39:44 I like all your answers! 

The first fragrance that comes to mind for me is myrrh. I can’t remember what it smells like right now but it reminds me of worship, anointing and healing. I worship my King who anoints my head with oil and heals my afflictions. 
9924 2018-11-08 02:39:40 Crude oil production in Venezuela “is in free fall” and could soon sink to below 1 million bpd, Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), told Reuters on Tuesday.

9928 2018-11-08 02:39:01 Michael are you a chemist that works with CBD oil? Blueyedanbichy I bet everyone says the same about your twitter name oh and you’ll be receiving the law suit papers in the mail soon. Any other comments? What’s that? No, no none?
9929 2018-11-08 02:38:40 meu deus eu fico muito triggered quando to chapado e oil fica metódico pra cacete pro rolê do casório.......
9930 2018-11-08 02:38:36 I dont have an air fryer, want one though. They are great in the deep fryer. Dont leave them in too long, though. (As in forget abt them for a bit, wh/ my son did.) They will still taste good but your next batch of fried food will be mush (due to oil consistency change).
9931 2018-11-08 02:38:27 CBD oil I am told will help....advice from a friend
9932 2018-11-08 02:38:19 It’s the 5 Basses X-Mas album (because you have to appeal to the base): songs include:
I’m Dreaming of the White Christians
Coal in Your Stocking is Great

Don’t Make the Yuletide Gay
9933 2018-11-08 02:38:19 The liberals and conservatives are part of deep oil fascist state that seeks to undermine democracy + citizens rights to freedom of speech+ clean+ protected environment. After paying off Enbridge p.m. has $0 for Canadians: not for national transportation or green energy projects.
9934 2018-11-08 02:37:59 Oil... just oil
9935 2018-11-08 02:37:54 Somebody let me borrow some coconut oil til tomorrow
9936 2018-11-08 02:37:46 Headline in @HoustonChron story about booming HOU economy: Harvey, oil gas shepard upturn. 
Actual report from U.H. Economist Gilmer: Biggest plus is STRONG U.S. ECONOMY by “virtually every economic measure.....probability of recession remains near zero.”  
#EconomicDeniers
9937 2018-11-08 02:37:45 imagine if people engaged with the oil and gas industry's belligerent interventions into American democracy the way they do the reality-tv president's strategic fights with TV reporters.
9938 2018-11-08 02:37:45 You don’t ‘have’ to do a big chop. You can always do a few cuts scattered (based on comfort). Also get a travel size spray bottle and mix your fav conditioner, water,& olive or avocado oil. Soray to freshen up throughout the day.

9941 2018-11-08 02:37:35 Well just had a another brotha ask me how my beard so nice and where he could get some beard oil .
9942 2018-11-08 02:37:17 It’s a dangerous time to be a man. All these false accusations. See how that works both ways.
9943 2018-11-08 02:37:11 Awesome, I would love to see the pics! Any chance you can share? I know porbeagle is sometimes caught when the oil platform workers rod & reel fish, but have seen few pictures.
9944 2018-11-08 02:37:05 Yes
9945 2018-11-08 02:37:02 No, its true, because she shelved the Bataan Nuclear power plant in favor of oil companies-spcifically Shell! You are a fake account!
9946 2018-11-08 02:36:40 Gonna have to try that. I’ve also sprayed peppermint oil and got a kitten 
9947 2018-11-08 02:36:35 You don’t believe proof on video, you are the sick, sad one
9948 2018-11-08 02:36:19 Hot oil and throw a torch.
Oh yeah that's Vikings!
9949 2018-11-08 02:36:16 Sunflower oil keep my skin so glowy
9950 2018-11-08 02:36:09 I just wanted to make sure I did all I could. Because I didn’t know whether the Native Americans were able to get it straightened out in time. Obviously not... oil companies will start running oil pipelines next to their water source now.
9951 2018-11-08 02:35:57 "The PH Manifesto is contradictory regarding energy. They pledge to increase renewable energy supply from 2 to 20 percent by 2025, but they also have aims to increase dependence on oil fiscal revenues." - Dr. Renato @TheASBmba
9952 2018-11-08 02:35:53 I quit smoking by vaping. You can make it without flavors & just a base mixed with liquid nicotine. I’m allergic to the VG vegan juice base & so I made my own with clove oil flavor & PG/Propylene Glycol base. I quit vaping after 6 mos.
9953 2018-11-08 02:35:52 お帰りなさいー(*´∇｀*)
9954 2018-11-08 02:35:51 just ordered an essential oil diffuser for the classroom ... praying for calmness the rest of the year 
9955 2018-11-08 02:35:44 I think it’s both. Calgary still has high unemployment espein the oil patch. And, how do you take the IOC seriously about their commitment to run clean games, when they reinstate Russia?
9956 2018-11-08 02:35:44 lavender & tea tree oil. 
9957 2018-11-08 02:35:42 คนไม่ใช่ ทำไรก็ผิด
9958 2018-11-08 02:35:34 @SecPernia says Build, Build, Build projects will remain a spending priority despite suspension of 2nd tranche of oil excise tax.
9959 2018-11-08 02:35:34 @myamacka Proof
9960 2018-11-08 02:35:32 it is despicable to snatch the microphone from a reporter. Don’t blame @Acosta or @cnn.
9961 2018-11-08 02:35:18 But he crossed the line when he grabbed her by the pussy. You have to be a star to do that, says someone I know.
9962 2018-11-08 02:35:18 He's a brutal misogynist.
9963 2018-11-08 02:35:11 try oil if you can find some!
9964 2018-11-08 02:35:08 I never thought that I’d come in contact with such weird customers working in a service department @ a car dealership but some of the things these customers are willing to share w/ u while they’re waiting on their oil change be having me baffled 
9965 2018-11-08 02:35:03 coconut oil
9966 2018-11-08 02:35:02 My parents always bitched about school fundraisers, but adult me CANNOT WAIT for my oil drum of popcorn to come in.
9967 2018-11-08 02:34:59 Those who choose to be blind will never see. I hope one day you wake from the fog that has you blindly believing everything fed to you by this administration and once again learn to use critical thinking skills.

Good day.
9968 2018-11-08 02:34:58 People who use rosehip oil, is it supposed to smell like puppy breath? Or does that mean it's gone bad?
9969 2018-11-08 02:34:53 Get better exterior lights and cameras. And sprinklers you can turn on from inside the house.
9970 2018-11-08 02:34:44 But at what point does cnn realize that this oil and water thing benefits no one. Acosta needs to step down
9971 2018-11-08 02:34:39 I got a $20 bonus from Sportsbet. Only after I emailed them. If they think $20 is going to make me keep my account they are dreaming! #flogs #bigbusinesscangetfucked #backtoubetforme
9972 2018-11-08 02:34:35 Yeah, we call like Roswell and Carlsbad "down south". Much more republican with all the oil
9973 2018-11-08 02:34:29 How come nobody has free trials of cbd oil
9974 2018-11-08 02:34:26 Lucky to still find Bragg’s in glass!

My favourite basic dressing is squirt of olive oil, clove of garlic, few squirts of apple cider vinegar & about the same amount of maple syrup, sea salt & pepper. It’s so good 
9975 2018-11-08 02:34:09 Was he saying it didn't happen?!
9976 2018-11-08 02:34:03 I'm thinking about the future when I'll be able to house a bird again and I'm looking up information about essential oil diffusers (since I can't burn candles around birds due to sensitive respiratory systems) and it's looking like I maybe shouldn't
I'm so disappointed
9977 2018-11-08 02:34:00 Wrist, if you’re going to be pedantic.
9978 2018-11-08 02:33:57 Jamaican Black Castor Oil, sis.
9979 2018-11-08 02:33:40 Told the girl they messed with her oil in the car, she better check it, but if she didn't and thought i was joking...yeah okay whatever. It's yo life. 
9980 2018-11-08 02:33:39 #INDIA: Over the next 10 years, it is India that will set the pace for global #oil demand. China’s share in growth, meanwhile, will shrink from the 58 .6% seen over 2008-2017, to 24 .8% over 2018-2027: @FitchSolutions
9981 2018-11-08 02:33:20 @aislinntlc Proof
9982 2018-11-08 02:33:07 @AndrewLittleMP Min Andrew.I know its a delicate subject but given the proxy vote by JLR to NZ First it should come as no surprise.For those of us who"watch"the key persons of Whale Oil they have expressed sentimnts of being allies wth Winston 4 some time.This needs consideration
9983 2018-11-08 02:33:02 We have behaved sanely; her execution would only have been possible if we had oil reserves of Saudi Arabia and superpower of China - otherwise, political sanity demanded to acquit her and let her go out of the country.
9984 2018-11-08 02:32:59 I live in Wa and use the CBD oil daily. Long line of mild depression in the family. I keeps me super level with rarely a swing. Love it
9985 2018-11-08 02:32:57 It was so funny when the president walked away from the podium. Acosta gave up the mic and sat down so fast. What a wussy!
9986 2018-11-08 02:32:52 Yeah. It’s the oil field. They will vote  republican even if the guy is straight out of the mafia they don’t care. Only way Heidi got elected was by the Native American Indian vote. They were purposely disenfranchised this time.
9987 2018-11-08 02:32:46 I want my next man to be black as hell. I’m talking burnt crispy dark. That’s gone give me a reason to oil him down 
9988 2018-11-08 02:32:42 You know I’m so glad you said this Carol.  As a minority who started off making $9.00 an hour working 100+ hours a week in the Oil and Gas industry, I never wanted anything but a chance.  Today’s leftist party wants to tell you they’ll give you everything for nothing..boo on that
9989 2018-11-08 02:32:33 Finally. Jim Fake News “l Been” Acosta is a dangerous misogynist. Assaults young female interns. The assaults must STOP.
9990 2018-11-08 02:32:33 It’s like a bad disease with NO CURE! That’s the only way I can explain it.
9991 2018-11-08 02:32:29 Kale, oil, apple vin, tomato, red onion, corn, avocado, chick peas, salt and pepper if I’m fancy shrimp and feta
9992 2018-11-08 02:32:26 @aislinntlc Prove
9993 2018-11-08 02:32:21 Alex Jones was right again
9994 2018-11-08 02:32:06 It's not his mike and he was told repeatedly that his turn was over.
I'm sure I'm not alone in being not surprised at the people that will defend Acosta's aggressive behavior, up to and including his treating this young woman this way.
9995 2018-11-08 02:32:00 What oil do ya got diffusing?  (I highly recommend orange or grapefruit - they’re very uplifting!)
9996 2018-11-08 02:31:57 In R.A reduce stress in your life/guided imagery/distraction/muscle relaxation with ETOIMS. Fish oil/plant oils/seeds of evening primrose/borage/black currant contain a fatty acid useful with pain/morning stiffness. Tai chi for gentle exercises&stretches with deep breathing
9997 2018-11-08 02:31:40 My parents voted no because they were afraid of how it would affect our bills. Of course I’m upset it didn’t pass, but I can see why people voted no, especially low income families. Big oil spent a lot of money on scare tactics.
9998 2018-11-08 02:31:37  มีหูทิพย์ๆ
9999 2018-11-08 02:31:37 Uhm yeah... you drive a foreign car. So if you choose to use the recomended product for your car you’ll have to get german oil and a german filter. Bmw’s have always been expensive due to their “high quality” oil and actual high quality filters.
10000 2018-11-08 02:30:51 And for some bizarre reason his base loves it

10003 2018-11-08 02:30:42 than that of travelers in Canada, especially wimin. Trudeau is not there to defend oil and gas and to hob nob with the who's who, but I have no better explanation.

10007 2018-11-08 02:29:56 People should start doing an "honest" assessment of their dependence on oil products. I mean everything. Not just the gas you put in a car. How that hot coffee got in your cup in the morning, to where the pillow you lay your head on at night comes from.
10008 2018-11-08 02:29:53 I am a conservative and wanted Cruz to win, primarily because of my political views and that I work in the Oil & Gas industry, but Beto is a great political figure that can really do some good. I hope he keeps working at making a difference!
10009 2018-11-08 02:29:49 Oil boys did a great bribe and scare job to get people to defeat this prop to move oil development further from residential use areas- latest issue of High Country News has great article about near catastrophic explosion of rig that was legally installed close to housing

10011 2018-11-08 02:29:40 He eas disrespectful to POTUS and everyone in the room. He should have handed the mic back to her but he's an ass.
10012 2018-11-08 02:29:40 Naw. We never did. As a chef though. Any oil from a nut , this case a legumes that isn't a nut. The oil can always go rancid. Which is off putting. It never lasted, for that to happen though in my place.
