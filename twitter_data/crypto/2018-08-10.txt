1 2018-08-12 23:59:46 ..When you write about wealth or company financial mechanics, it's from an outsider's point of view. LOL! Pretty much EVERYTHING about you says you're not who you say you are. Hahaha. Go back to your crypto, kid.

4 2018-08-12 23:58:02 I like what I read.  Certainly the esports industry is enormous and has a large overlap with the demographic who would be into crypto.  Use cases seem reasonable and doable.  Team seems legit and responsible.  I’m in.  Hope I’m right.

6 2018-08-12 23:57:38 Lol so many people are mad because they never invested a day in their lives before crypto and lost money.

Don't feel bad at all. I've lost money and I'm a massive $DRGN fan. They are doing great things.

13 2018-08-11 23:59:45 Wtf are you talking about?

"If the public wanted to know about the effects of climate change, (before the public knew about climate change), they should have crowd-funded the research to find out the effects of climate change" 

Huh?

31 2018-08-10 23:59:48 How do you assess if somethings cheap when no one knows how to truly value it

33 2018-08-10 23:59:28 Stop bulldozing your assumptions over here! DigiByte is a silent giant and what you need to do is accept it and hold some. No coin has all of the characteristics of DigiByte period. Line of code takes agreement! DGB already agrees about what it’s wants to be no forks! 
34 2018-08-10 23:59:19 Bugün (tarih: 11.08.2018): Türkiye'de bir süre hayat durdu. Esnaf kepenk kapattı, şirketler acil toplantı düzenledi, fabrikalar üretimi durdu, halk tedirgin bir şekilde beklemeye başladı. Günlerdir artan dolar kuru diye konuştuk fakat malesef ki aslında durum sadece bu değildi.
