38 2018-11-22 22:02:47 The gazzetting of  several commodities to pay duty in US Dollars will feed inflation. Whereas retailers used to pay duty in RTGS, this move forces them to either sell in USD or at exchange rate adjusted RTGS/Bond Prices. The currency question looms large.

39 2018-11-22 21:59:04 Am seein the raise in basic commodities or traders will start demanding forex n who cn blame them  so a gud advice frm mi plz start emptying ur bonds u hve saved cuz at end o e day its gonna be useless
40 2018-11-22 21:55:58 I know!! Amazing what a food system not optimized exclusively for commodities traders can do for ordinary people...
41 2018-11-22 21:40:20 Every where I go, people whining about the insignificant commodities in their lives, and I'm like, "but I don't speak whinese".
42 2018-11-22 21:38:16 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
43 2018-11-22 21:18:07 Or the most valuable of commodities; tea milk and biscuits
44 2018-11-22 21:17:30 Yeah its complicated Thatcher sold off the housing stock on the cheap built by previous generations as homes not commodities. Next the capitalists arrived to exploit and now we have a housing crisis. Corbyn will build council houses thats the solution
45 2018-11-22 21:11:31 The economics are different with higher volume commodities though. Production steps up, local distributors and installers grow and become more efficient, competition increases etc.
46 2018-11-22 21:07:04 Capitalism: It's a dominant ideology that puts wealth before people. It reduces people to commodities and units of wealth production. It pits everyone against everyone in a fight to the death. It was always a cancer.
47 2018-11-22 21:06:08 Said another way.  Im bullish almost all commodities!

49 2018-11-22 21:01:18 Forty years after the 1970s, when processed food started being seriously marketed, and it seems that its now the cheapest option around. Eating fresh produce is not only more expensive but more time-consuming, two commodities to which many have ever-decreasing access.
50 2018-11-22 20:50:07 Yep. Very easy for the treasury, ny fed and exchange stability fund to print worthless fiat and suppress commodities. This has been going on with gold/silver for a while. I mean what do ya think the missing 21 trillion has been used for. #bitcoin #crypto #cryptocurrency #gold
51 2018-11-22 20:49:37 Increase in fuel duty have a direct effect on prices of commodities. Therez bound to be general price increases across
With a mnm taxable income now 350 up from 300, isn't it like the ordinary citizen has been made to shield the economic heat?
52 2018-11-22 20:44:06 Imagine increase of Fuel levy on already heavily taxed citizens and businesses .Zimbabwe Businesses rely on road importation for most commodities that will mean increase in Food commodities. #NationalBudgetZW

Porque Bozo & milicos & evangs já têm sua taxa!
56 2018-11-22 20:03:24 Do you suggest to buy commodities simply from the knock on impact of a weaker usd or is there another factor there?
57 2018-11-22 19:59:46 Use the highest & lowest numbers from two completely different traded commodities,  and take the credit for the fall. 

Only problem with your numbers @realDonaldTrump, they are, how do you put it, #FakeNews
#Wti #Brent
58 2018-11-22 19:58:44 By increasing tax on already burdened tax payers? That budget is a load of crap, fuel prices will increase, that also means prices of basic commodities will increase, the tax hikes are inflationary and you want to tell me about economic growth?
59 2018-11-22 19:48:24 If the usd and bond note are truly at par why is gvt demanding duty on some commodities in usd
60 2018-11-22 19:46:25 Because everything works in a cycle... the tide will turn, and commodities will head higher.
61 2018-11-22 19:41:15 He has good intentions but wrong timing, we have suffered long enough. Everything else is measured in usd$ but we continue to get our salaries thru RTGS. All the commodities are prized in USD at black market rate. 2kg Mahatma rice is prized at $3.00 USD or $9.50 Bond .
62 2018-11-22 19:23:15 so you won't decline health care because of your religious beliefs but you would deny them basic commodities... and you claiming we have double standards
63 2018-11-22 19:20:13 Seems like a failure to distinguish people from commodities
64 2018-11-22 19:06:51 An increase in fuel costs will have domino effects in manufacturing, cost of imported goods ,transport costs ,wages ,etc . The cost of basic commodities will certainly not come down & this may dampen mood over festive season ....unless all salaries  & bonuses are in USD?
65 2018-11-22 18:56:22 Y nosotros, como País, debemos rezar que esto continúe, ya sea con El o con quien lo suceda al mando; esa es la triste suerte de los Países que dependemos de las materias primas o commodities, como les llaman los economistas...
66 2018-11-22 18:56:11 Are you in business? You'll find issues of investment, access to certain markets is restricted if you're under sanctions. They called ours 'targeted' sanctions. But our manufacturing sector collapsed coz there was no recapitalization. You are importing basic commodities No?

68 2018-11-22 18:19:55 Bom, quem puxou a alta de commodities anterior foi a China, comprando. Confesso que não sei quais são as commodities que ela vende.
69 2018-11-22 18:17:09 Buying rail cars means more offload storage,  does not mean they can get to market faster.  Our Western farming communities need to get their commodities to market as well,  to me this just adds a backlog onto someone else.
70 2018-11-22 18:10:18 How can a manager of such za commodities fund believe in btc? nobody uses btc, miners going bust as we speak, it's an environmental disaster,  not sustainable. If I had money in your fund I would start worry.
71 2018-11-22 18:09:31 Gas prices have nothing to do w/POTUS. They are "Commodities". Not stocks. The prices are set a YEAR prior to the current calendar year. That's why traders are called "speculators". They guess at their worth. Might as well go to Vegas. Farm crops aka futures are the same way
72 2018-11-22 18:08:31 Absurd flaunt of wealth and commodities, yet, I digress
73 2018-11-22 18:01:44 the cannabis flower is definitely a commodity, however the industry players are targeting vertical integration (oils, drinks etc) so as such it's a hybrid. Lower commodity costs will help margins for their end products.  In a bear mkt, all risk assets lose (commodities & pot)

78 2018-11-22 17:31:11 Or maybe it’s the marketing “time travel commodities” or “marketing the Masculine Men’s Toilets” or the Flatbed trailer sales that impresses Casey.
79 2018-11-22 17:26:13 You’re not looking at the right metrics.  De-dollarization is it about usage, it’s about settlement, & in particular, settlement of commodities.  Look at global CB holdings of USTs v gold since 2013 & what’s happening leaps off the page.
80 2018-11-22 17:23:40 O maior problema do comércio com os EUA é que o Brasil é um país pouco industrializado, então uma abertura de mercado antes de uma industrialização nós sairíamos atrás, em comparação entre commodities e produtos industrializados, o segundo representa apenas uma fração do mercado.
81 2018-11-22 17:23:19 Interesting comment..so all commodities have the same supply? There is as much gold and silver as there is coffee? Coffee can increase supply and its still a commodity..you may need to look up the definition of a commodity..decentralized? The XRP-L is proven as or more..->

86 2018-11-22 17:15:51 Yes, block chain could help enable something like this for commodities
87 2018-11-22 17:05:25 Pedir tratarla igual no es realista. Otros callar y no criticarla, es cruel. En Venezuela hay un holocausto en pleno siglo XXI.

91 2018-11-22 16:52:42 Mas a desaceleração econômica desses mercados não reduz a demanda (e portanto os preços)?

E outra, a China é COMPRADORA de commodities, não vendedora, certo?
92 2018-11-22 16:50:49 The idea of alts started off OK:

1995-2018
S&P 500 = +9.7%
REITs = +10.3%

Then took a turn for the worse:

2002-2018
REITs = +9.3%
Commodities = +2.5%

The latest batch show no signs of improvement over v1.0:

2010-2018
REITs = +10.0%
Risk Parity = +5.0%
Managed Futures = +0.7%
93 2018-11-22 16:49:19 Em 2001 saindo da grave crise asiatica 1997/99 o PIB per capta da Koreia era de US$ 12 mil, o do Brasil com a desvalorizacão pré Lula caira a US$ 10 mil. Após 16 anos o pib per capta da Koreia é $39 mil e o Brasileiro $14 mil. Legado PT. A Koreia não tem commodities e nem pre-sal
94 2018-11-22 16:48:05 O motivo são as barreiras impostas às commodities chinesas, que podem favorecer novos mercados como o Brasil.
95 2018-11-22 16:37:56 Precisely! There will be a run on the market for forex and other  commodities.
96 2018-11-22 16:37:47 Wheat along with silver are probably 2 of the most undervalued commodities right now.
97 2018-11-22 16:32:40 Also gold/commodities/dericvatives are heavily manipulated by gov't's and regulatory agencies. Ask any serious commodity trader
98 2018-11-22 16:31:11 Perdoe minha ignorância, mas desaceleração nos EUA e na Europa não significaria baixa nas commodities, por falta de demanda?
99 2018-11-22 16:30:58 This seems plausible.That's why in medieval period, when agricultural produce were the only commodities, invaders attacked this land. This is also the reason for high population density in this region.
100 2018-11-22 16:16:09 Apropos your point, I've wondered why futures markets are open when the underlying are closed. I can understand commodities because there's a market almost always open but US equities? Not that I would prohibit it but it makes the market less efficient IMO.

104 2018-11-22 16:03:56 Aí junte o fato da bonanza do gov Lula ter sido baseado em commodities dado o cenário internacional favorável (e msm assim o Brasil foi um dos países q menos cresceu naquela década. Perdemos pra país da América Central) e o PT dizer q classe média é quem ganha RS300 per capita

106 2018-11-22 15:55:10 And how can a gvt survive by milking citizens? If there is no exportation of commodities then there is no way of surviving.
107 2018-11-22 15:52:05 an exception cant be taken as regular. Everyday crores of Indian travel altogether. We never asked the caste of sellers of food and commodities. there are crores of example that India has moved on but you are sticking at same point to get special benefit.
108 2018-11-22 15:51:05 4/4) Real Estate is another class of investment that offers significant long-term return and serves as a good hedge against inflation, same with stocks to a reasonable extent. Commodities such as gold and precious metals are also good sources of long-term value.

110 2018-11-22 15:45:07 "Regulatory ... bring us down" - ofc it will change crypto-sphere, but did stocks/gold/other commodities/derivatives/etc only suffer from being regulated and traded safe world-wide? regulatory is an essential and inevitable thing establishing ABSOLUTELY NEW market in a global way
111 2018-11-22 15:39:03 Capitalism is characterized by private ownership of the means of production, extraction of surplus value by the owning class for the purpose of capital accumulation, wage-based labor and—at least as far as commodities are concerned—being market-based.

121 2018-11-22 14:31:57 printing money causes the USD to weaken and commodities to strenghten. Oil is a commodity and it's pegged the dollar. Right now our dollar is strong so oil is falling, as is the stock market. Things will reset. The prez is doing a fine job. Relax. Things will be ok.

124 2018-11-22 14:14:57 Overvalued commodities and stocks all need an adjustment. Prices should fall; then possibly more sales will occur. If the RENT was not so DAMN high, I might buy something new. My 15 year old Altima and crashing on my Sisters couch has got to change.
125 2018-11-22 14:09:35 Asi como seguir dependiendo de la venta de commodities sin hacer un cambio planificado, incentivado y controlado, si no empezamos una política de inmigración sabiendo que no hay tasa de recambio, que hay interesados y oportunidades, no es un error es negligencia.

129 2018-11-22 13:56:37 Those who are selling #Bitcoin here, have no idea of market cycles. Every market is manipulated.

$BTC is still very much a great “Store of Value.”
130 2018-11-22 13:56:13 Money is just like stock in the issuing nation-state. US currency floats and is publicly traded. Who controls that?

Also, you can buy stock and commodities outside of the dollar. I do.

131 2018-11-22 13:49:47 Conflating oil rigs with nuclear is a physics 101 level fail. Hard data beats fear any day. And do you seriously believe that RE can be produced without commodities?
132 2018-11-22 13:43:36 Lol we did not. I only DMed my points about oil nothing about SARB. I wasn't even done talking. I stay far from the JSE40 because of those gap ups and downs. I love holding long position s so those gaps aren't good for me. I'll stick to Dow Jones 30 and commodities.
133 2018-11-22 13:41:49 I'm coming to the view that the CFP is not the real issue, rather it is one of allocation and management of Quotas. Where Quotas are allowed to be traded as commodities and no tie in between quotas, harbour or landing
134 2018-11-22 13:38:59 They would only get nothing if they didn't produce any of the commodities that are eligible for the $$$  or didn't go to the FSA office to sign up.
135 2018-11-22 13:30:08 Selling deep OTM naked calls in commodities is a high probability play for getting blown out, especially if scaled.  Velocity risk is to the upside, almost never to the down side.  Validates Black Swan....

170 2018-11-22 09:57:33 Basic commodities are going to become unbuyable. Put some things in place first. Moreover you don't necessarily have to increase minimum wage before you better the lives of people. Better policies, provide basic commodities improved economy, create jobs. 100k m/w is an overreach

175 2018-11-22 09:46:05 Nah, it is not achievable, even if it is, it is not reasonable. There's something called inflation in economics... If you increase minimum wage to 100k, trust me market commodities are going to skyrocket. Alakia to Iwo Road would cost 500 naira.

178 2018-11-22 09:30:55 That's why our naira skyrocketed to almost 400 to the dollar in 2015. Now that's the change I've seen. Prices of commodities have refused to come down to the pre 2015 prices. Well, I ain't a soldier of the change so who am I to know what happens in the background
179 2018-11-22 09:26:32 To answer my own question, look at Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford, that endless list. Children raped, tortured, enslaved, passed around like commodities. Their crime, being unbelievers, little white whores. That’s our children’s future.

181 2018-11-22 09:22:55 Oh and all commodities prices are falling thanks to rising interest rates and investors moving out of commodities and into bonds. It’s not you, it’s macroeconomics.
182 2018-11-22 09:17:12 Not the same thing at all. If I'd borrowed £60 in the 50's to buy a house that house would now be worth £500,000. You'd borrow for infrastructure, not commodities. Which I suspect you actually know.

230 2018-11-22 05:13:46 Si, pero Py no depende económicamente de la industria aún, en parte xq es un proceso en construcción y x otro lado, al sector agro ganadero exportador le va súper bien produciendo y vendiendo commodities. 

Eso no va a cambiar aún. Al sector 1rio le basta un capataz y un labriego
231 2018-11-22 05:09:33 Napoleon Hill says opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. 

Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. 

If you are influenced by "opinions" when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in any undertaking.

233 2018-11-22 05:01:41 Give us some insight into what damage this House can do, economically. Will they be implementing tariffs on commodities? Will they create trillion dollar deficits with corporate tax cuts?
234 2018-11-22 05:00:02 Commodities: Rubber +1.35%, Natural gas +1.24%
235 2018-11-22 04:53:27 This single truck has 3 C value commodities?
236 2018-11-22 04:51:06 Well thank goodness the business world has more of a moral compass than our president. The crown Prince should be removed. And we should not supply any military commodities until he is removed.
237 2018-11-22 04:42:05 A JPMORGAN COMMODITIES TRADER!
238 2018-11-22 04:33:17 @PeterLBrandt loved your video at Real Vision. Commodities are too cheap. Pls consider - all commodities you mentioned are part of inflation basket. The S&P derives almost none of its income from inflation basket. Policy is keep inflation down. Policy keeps prices low.
239 2018-11-22 04:31:18 Does self proclaimed shrewd businessman really not understand what drives commodities pricing? Did he not notice the recent push to cut production targets in order to prop the price up?
240 2018-11-22 04:29:53 In principle, a larger bargaining block means lower cost per capita. And single payer has the largest possible bargaining block. Same principle as labor unions and commodities trading and any other time one buys in bulk. Always cheaper. Every time? Yes every time.
241 2018-11-22 04:27:53 A questão não é o partido. Nós, vendedores de commodities, deveríamos industrializá-las. Pois, quando se tem ofertas de salários dignos para a toda população do país, talvez, fatalmente, precisaríamos não só de cubanos, mas de qualquer outra classe de pessoas dispostas.
242 2018-11-22 04:19:05 “All of the deleveragings that we have studied... eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, and currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, and stocks).” - Ray Dalio, Big Debt Crises, p33

243 2018-11-22 04:04:08 SW is a theme park that engages some rescue, likely for the PR benefit it provides. A theme park with a heavily greenwashed message that commodities the animals it claims to care for while mis-educating consumers is the exact opposite of what's needed in the world right now.
244 2018-11-22 04:02:26 The cost of essential commodities was already v.high and 3.4% inflation making it higher.The i/p costs for farming increased so they are unhappy. Without tax cuts (5% cut in absolute terms is ~Rs.1000 p.m) middle class have less money left.Both farmers & middle class unhappy
245 2018-11-22 03:56:33 My point is things have gone from bad to worse.I did a comparison between now and Mugabe's time in relation to prices of commodities.

247 2018-11-22 02:53:24 ARE YOU ALSO TAKING CREDIT FOR THE OTHER STOCKS AND COMMODITIES PRICES THAT HAVE DRAMATICALLY PLUNGED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS RIGHT ALONG WITH THE PRICE OF A BARREL OF CRUDE OIL? LET YOU TELL IT OIL FELL DUE TO YOUR HARD WORK.
248 2018-11-22 02:52:47 I'm pretty sure he doesn't understand anything about global  commodities trading either, and that dropping oil prices and soaring gold prices are serious warning signs....
249 2018-11-22 02:51:28 ARE YOU ALSO TAKING CREDIT FOR THE OTHER STOCKS AND COMMODITIES PRICES THAT HAVE DRAMATICALLY PLUNGED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS SIMILAR TO THE PRICE OF A BARREL OF CRUDE OIL? LET YOU TELL IT OIL FELL DUE TO YOUR HARD WORK.
250 2018-11-22 02:50:13 SO YOU ALSO TAKING CREDIT FOR OTHER STOCKS AND COMMODITIES THAT HAVE DRAMATICALLY PLUNGED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS SIMILAR TO THE PRICE OF A BARREL OF CRUDE OIL?
251 2018-11-22 02:43:15 You are basically saying that Ratings cannot be trusted... Financial markets are built on credibility. There is Rs 12000 crore commodities exchange #NSEL fraud...Money not returned to 13000 families...PSU banks have huge NPAs & inadequately capitalized. 

Bad times during BJP!
252 2018-11-22 02:32:31 HE IS FULL OF SHITTTT
Commodities are extremely volatile. Markets never value commodites properly. Most always r over or undervalued. OiLs predetermined value (By world leaders) is $75 per barrel.
SA will back off on production to bring it back up.

253 2018-11-22 02:11:28 Burmese migrant laborers I have met don't seem to want to be more than a long bus-ride away from their families.

But maybe they are insufficiently aware of themselves as commodities and insist on their own humanity?

255 2018-11-22 02:04:47 Another example of Whitaker’s lack of knowledge and experience. He is the most unqualified AG in recent history. Perhaps he should consider returning to one of his previous gigs: Marketing time travel commodities, Marketing the Masculine Men’s Toilet, Selling flatbed trailers.
256 2018-11-22 02:02:56 Commodities Trading Results (A) - WTI oil:-

1. [22.11.18 - 22.11.18] - Short 55.29, TP 54.00, Gain 2.39% x10
257 2018-11-22 01:57:26 I wonder if you are confusing oil futures/spot prices with actual prices.  Producers set their own prices which, just like gold and other commodities, are typically spot +/- some percentage.
258 2018-11-22 01:55:02 TECH GIANTS ARE TAKING A HIT.
Lots of reasons but I believe a loss of public confidence & board room behavior that made customer well being a non starter in corporate goals.

Treating customers like commodities, used cars that can be stripped for parts, is a losing strategy.

259 2018-11-22 01:48:48 The 2005 film Robots subversively illustrates the way in which capitalism’s strategies of misinformation and market manipulation accelerate a collective pursuit of unattainable commodities as objects of desire, and so drives normal people/robots to “chop shops." In this essay I
260 2018-11-22 01:44:02 As the most unqualified AG in recent history, Whitaker should return to one of his previous gigs:

- Marketing the Masculine Men’s Toilet
- Selling flatbed trailers

261 2018-11-22 01:35:38 The use of sex-dolls in the video seems to be a tasteful satire on rap culture's tendency to objectify women to the point of them only serving as status symbols and pleasurable commodities. Very progressive.
262 2018-11-22 01:18:30 Growing up pains, lah. Weaning Malaysians off open-ended handouts & subsidies. Acknowledging the realities of global commodities markets. And that countries can grow & prosper without natural resources.
263 2018-11-22 01:05:25 And as I posted earlier, when fuel goes up so does everything else because 90% of all household commodities are transported by truck drivers.

Commodities são sim um privilegio mas não um essencial, para de choro ++++

270 2018-11-22 00:27:29 Wish more would stand up to Big Ag and factory farming, animal abuse, leaving thousands of animals to die in floods and fires because they’re considered “commodities,” and slaughtering wildlife so cattle can graze on our taxpayer funded public lands.
