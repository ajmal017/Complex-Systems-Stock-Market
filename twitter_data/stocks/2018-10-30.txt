4 2018-10-30 23:59:13 Trump does actually. You are just very misinformed. Did Obama get rid of bump stocks? No. But Trump has it in process. Common sense law.

40 2018-10-30 23:54:54 $GE is worth something unknowable. Which makes it not worth my time. There are thousands of stocks.
41 2018-10-30 23:52:59 Like they did under the last DEMS,? 
Sounds like Trump knows his coat tail ride off the Auto pilot Obama economy ,is heading towards the last turn,even with his 25% yearly windfall that bought back stocks instead of investing in Infrastrucure  and healthcare
42 2018-10-30 23:52:59 Where is the wall? Why we still supporting Saudi Arabia, worst terrorist country in the world? Where is his tax returns? Why is he golfing twice as much as Obama? Why are bump stocks still legal? Why are the cost of living going up, but salaries stagnated? the list is long ...
43 2018-10-30 23:52:42 Just threw my normal monthly $2k split between US and Int. stocks without a care in the world. Gotta stay the course during the #FIRESale

46 2018-10-30 23:51:15 Apple should make a sports app that's like the Stocks app. Pick you sports/teams and have a clean interface with related news. 

Most the apps I've come across are terrible.
47 2018-10-30 23:50:33 Just for reference, stocks are up 23% since you took office. In the same stretch under Obama, they were up 39%.
48 2018-10-30 23:49:53 Even though I have been talking about a recession coming and how it will affect stocks and eventually real estate, I would say relax, its only October. I understand markets are on the edge and all, the real recession is a few months away. I am expecting a slight bounce back rn.
49 2018-10-30 23:48:33 The Chinese and the Fed are messing with the markets. While we had a great Q3 GDP figure, would be nice to have a calm week for the stocks pre-midterms.
50 2018-10-30 23:47:46 There is home made bump stocks featured on tube. Even ones for pistols. Being the action rate of a semi auto is around 1/20 to 1/10 of a second. This is what makes the detachable magazine feed semi automatic weapons so dangerous in civilian hands.
51 2018-10-30 23:47:22 As much as I'd love to play look at a company's stocks and profits and try to tell Trump supporters that their decision to not buy the products are not gonna make them bankrupt, I don't really feel like getting a headache from them.
52 2018-10-30 23:47:13 Surprisingly, I’m still positive after dumping a lot of stocks. +3.75%
53 2018-10-30 23:46:57 I bought the dip today #btfd $spy $dji #stocks $fb and shorted $tsla $tslaq #Tesla #Facebook
54 2018-10-30 23:46:31 Wow. Guess Saudi’s not tapping crude. Short defense stocks, long crude
55 2018-10-30 23:46:17 not avoiding the question but that happens to be the truth.  My only equity exposure is the stocks in our fund.  It's quite simply the best risk/reward I've ever seen, it's just going to take time and be bumpy as hell.
56 2018-10-30 23:45:08 what stocks do you own...tsla, amazon, fb?
57 2018-10-30 23:44:30 Consumer Confidence is not a high as some may think. People are watching there dollars since the stocks have been up and down
58 2018-10-30 23:42:25 As someone with a full time job that can't analyze charts all day, sticking with long term stocks and not trying to time the market is my only option.
59 2018-10-30 23:41:55 Glass-Steagall was in place since the Great Depression & it prevented Banks from using the Public';s savings & checking money to gamble on stocks & investments. 

BILL CLINTON & REPUBLICANS REPEALED THAT SHIT in 2001.

BOOM. 
7 years later. US Gov hands Wall St. a blank check.
60 2018-10-30 23:41:53 Looks like worst is over for #USstocks for now. Nature of recovery here will determine longer term future direction. Expect stocks to meander up into the mid-term election - 6 days away.
61 2018-10-30 23:41:35 4 Launches this week so far all green including $KIM today .. scanners have picked many stocks .. new Launch list coming for Halloween
62 2018-10-30 23:40:19 Interesting thought: Stock Market experts often use PE ratio to measure relative 'value' of stocks historically  of how much a company is worth, but what about how much money is in Options/Derivative financial bets? How does that effect value & volatility? Bets on bets on debts
63 2018-10-30 23:39:57 I buy and sell my own stocks and I rarely lose but this stock is depressing a massive company like this is so miss managed.

66 2018-10-30 23:38:41 Like your tax returns, all talk, all lies, all the time.  If you want the stock market to go up, vote DEM.  Stocks go up during DEM administration, underperform for refuglicans.   Look it up!
67 2018-10-30 23:37:56 I wonder if he finally realized the correlation of low sales with his MAGA love? Kaepernick’s shirts sold out? Nike’s stocks are up? Eminem’s album sales?
68 2018-10-30 23:37:50 I had made the argument a week ago that seeing capitulation would be necessary for a better risk/reward BUY for stocks, but now everyone seems to be singing the same tune, & many have shifted to betting on more downside-While trends are down, it will pay to respect >2707 in S&P
69 2018-10-30 23:37:37 Besides cannabis stock what stocks or sectors would you invest in ?  And don’t avoid the question and say you only invest in cannabis.
70 2018-10-30 23:37:28 Hey question from a friend, why does @mountainofbayst not write for capital ideas anymore ??? Heard it's cause he picks shit #stocks
@holdingbag @BullishBearz @Longshot2018

72 2018-10-30 23:36:31 most Trumpers don't own stocks.  Does Trump own stock investments?
73 2018-10-30 23:36:14 Major U.S. stock indexes jumped more than 1 percent overnight, helped by strong gains for chip and transport stocks. The Dow Jones rose 431.72 points to 24,874.64, the S&P 500 gained 41.38 points, to 2,682.63 and the Nasdaq Composite added 111.36 points to 7,161.65.
74 2018-10-30 23:35:04 Rep Smucker on shootings: “we need to ensure our background check system works properly” does not address his NRA funding. Mentions he opposes bump stocks and predicts legislation to ban them will pass
75 2018-10-30 23:34:36 But your stocks are plummeting Donald !
76 2018-10-30 23:34:00 I have partial answers.  Do the background checks everyone seems to be in favor of. They all use AR-15s, which should contribute to profiling them. If banning the AR-15 would solve the problem...but it won't, because it has no unique suitability, unlike an RPG-7.  Ban bump stocks
77 2018-10-30 23:33:01 my stocks recovered with Obzma
78 2018-10-30 23:33:01 Seeing a lot of strength, volume and potential bases forming in Healthcare Service names $AMED $ENDP $HCA $HIIQ $HMSY $NEO $PINC $TCMD

Keep an open mind to new stocks/sectors taking over. Your beloved current leaders don't last forever
79 2018-10-30 23:31:43 More broadly speaking, I think #cryptos are being treated like stocks, and if sold quickly for cash at a profit would require paying short-term capital gains.
80 2018-10-30 23:31:06 Ha! Like magic 
I bet @page45 stocks it too.

We loved your Dr Who, thank you for bringing history to life with such a thump - and for respecting young peoples’ capacity for difficult ideas.
81 2018-10-30 23:30:11 I remember in Y2K, I turned to Jeff and said, "if we can't find any stocks we wanna buy here; what does that tell us?"  We turned and got short; thinking "it's a market of stocks, not a stock market."

What are you making?
82 2018-10-30 23:30:02 No matter who is voted in stocks are gonna take a dip, market is in the process of a correction
83 2018-10-30 23:29:47 As interest rates rise, the stock market is having to compete with financial institutions for money.  Low profitability, low dividend paying stocks are going to be in for a baptism of fire
84 2018-10-30 23:29:47 I was wondering his stance on assault weapons? I agree with everything he said but has he ever mentioned anything about bump stocks or high powered assault type weapons?
85 2018-10-30 23:26:54 I believe in you and i would buy stocks in your weird car company.
86 2018-10-30 23:26:30 Down with stocks I say!  That’s a short-term small price to pay!
87 2018-10-30 23:25:12 Playing with stocks is very addicting.
88 2018-10-30 23:24:34 Europe and #dax will move up, be careful ....  maybe your President makes some dovish comments on #trade and then we will have a firework until Christmas .... Dax to move 11800/  12900 and perhaps 13200 this year 2018. Many EU- stocks have reached intrinsic value.
89 2018-10-30 23:24:31 and why would one care for what @jimcramer says? He has an opinion on all stocks.
90 2018-10-30 23:24:04 Depends on what terms but maybe a signal ? 

Also remember Klaus got all the free stocks & options and due to him selling twice plus macro we are where we are and at these ridiculous levels. 

IMO if Klaus didn’t sell we would be at 20c level !
91 2018-10-30 23:22:21 Great question!  It’s because the market is a future-discounting mechanism.  Markets saw a bright future and bid up stocks.  As that future fails to materialize or if a different future is envisioned (higher rates), present prices must fall...unless they’re really outperforming.

93 2018-10-30 23:21:48 Worked for Nike...stocks up.
94 2018-10-30 23:21:29 Yes I am.  Please show me where the 2A does not allow for reasonable gun control like banning bump stocks and making sure mentally unstable people do not get guns.
95 2018-10-30 23:20:41 It's going down because of the trade war uncertainties... read any business news... Nobody except Trump is talking about Venezuela, which is interesting, because he has a lot in common with that dictator down south... anyway, if you want your stocks to go up, vote #Dems and wait
96 2018-10-30 23:20:22 yeah! rare lang ‘yung stocks ng chargers so it’s like they’re forcing you to buy their new laptops 
97 2018-10-30 23:19:47 Elections have nothing to do with stocks. Stop lying.
98 2018-10-30 23:19:32 A pullback in a few ASX miners next month or so, gives me a chance to add new #Gold stocks to the portfolio.
99 2018-10-30 23:18:48 Check your stocks 2 years ago and now. Never goes up forever. Tariffs are a long term fix that no other President had the guts to do. A little medicine to fix years of bad trade.
100 2018-10-30 23:16:49 Do you do any indices or FX stuff as well or just individual stocks?
101 2018-10-30 23:15:01 You lived up to that political philosophy throughout your tenure. You are not two-faced. Times have changed. People are ready for penny stocks, lottery winnings, wild adventures and quick answers to legal dilemmas, such as people complaining against people on #socialmedia. #China
102 2018-10-30 23:14:08 Well technically if I vote blue my stocks would go up since they are mostly tied to clean energy... they would actually go down if I vote red... sooooo......
103 2018-10-30 23:14:02 i hope lil yatchy invested his money into stocks and bonds cuz my nigga we aint trynna hear anymore music
104 2018-10-30 23:13:15 November is gonna be a great month for trading stocks. My short term loss turned into solid profits 
105 2018-10-30 23:12:59 Correct! Buy Stocks of great company’s
106 2018-10-30 23:12:49 The bumpy rally in US stocks could reflect optimism ahead of the US Mid-term election on 6th November. The spotlight on corporate earnings report may continue as investors await Apple’s earnings report on Thursday @JonoChan_CMC
107 2018-10-30 23:12:38 Majority of Americans do not own stocks, but they won't drop dramatically, they will fluctuate as usual.
108 2018-10-30 23:12:03 I see the stocks for Kleenex and Puffs are at an all time high. Democrats still shedding tears 
109 2018-10-30 23:10:37 Yep that adds up. Cannabis stocks down 100%....
110 2018-10-30 23:10:31 NOW NOW, We'll have not of that "tom foolery" Until they're fingers gets itchy!
So that's where the bumper stocks went!
Ok, woopsie!
How can they aim with the hoses at full tilt?
... and in the battle, Hillery came out to speak but developed a case of WATER ON THE KNEE! AHH!
111 2018-10-30 23:10:23 Pureval favors a ban on bump stocks, high-capacity magazines and military-style assault weapons.
112 2018-10-30 23:09:39 ya you know how the financial world works right? analysts give guidance and making forward projections. now Im questioning you even buy stocks if you dont know something as basic as that.
113 2018-10-30 23:09:35 It's called back & fill and it makes for a super strong stock market, weeding out the overpriced stocks in the Dow & S&P, & setting up for a HUGE US economy.
114 2018-10-30 23:09:20 They’re for the winterrr  17 Audi stocks 
115 2018-10-30 23:08:01 No problem mate:) and so did I...covred pretty early. Not easy to short momentum stocks..big dose of patience. Now everybody thinks it is...will see.
116 2018-10-30 23:06:12 You clearly don’t know how stocks work. They did great after the initial kaepernick add and are now following trends with the rest of the market. Please stop tweeting fake news
117 2018-10-30 23:05:10 #MAGA  It is so obvious what is going on with the Stock Market.. The Dems r so desperate When poll no. r in Reps favor the stocks get sold..by the Dems  Then the Rep buy a day or 2 later.. It is all politics. The co. earnings are to high for this non sense to be going on
118 2018-10-30 23:04:55 Foreign Funds Sell Philippine Stocks for 44th Straight Day
119 2018-10-30 23:04:40 So fed can’t control long end and tanking stocks won’t help with lowering long dated yields? Care to add if more important for stocks or bonds?
120 2018-10-30 23:03:56 The majority of us would rather see the stocks go down a tad and have leadership vs fear based extremism and an increase in active shooters blasting good humans away daily.
121 2018-10-30 23:02:47 Are those stocks Bakelite?
122 2018-10-30 23:02:32 For the fun of it, ran a high Sharpe screen today (252 day >3). Out of a universe of 3577 stocks, only 1 result TNDM.
123 2018-10-30 23:02:25 The stock market means nothing to the average American, they don’t own stocks. The stock market does always seem to do better under a Democratic administration.
124 2018-10-30 23:02:19 Honestly the use I get out of this move does not justify how many stocks I've lost cause of it
125 2018-10-30 23:02:18 Curious...

Any yall even have stocks that would benefit from what trumps done?

(He's not doing it for, you)
126 2018-10-30 23:01:36 You just said the other day that stocks have entered into a downtrend and not to take it lightly. Which is it?
127 2018-10-30 23:00:08 Do you watch the tape closely in your trading of pot stocks? Or do you look more at fundamentals, macro, etc
128 2018-10-30 22:59:29 I, too have a pension and while I do have some individual stocks my focus is 75% stock index ETFS and the remainder in bond index ETFS and REIT indexes.  I like the bonds and the REITs to hedge against volitility & I like those regular dividends.
129 2018-10-30 22:58:40 Did you know that the #fishing #pressures we apply on fish stocks #globally means that there are fewer old #fish?
.
A 2017 study undertaken in EU and US fisheries found that the #population of older fish in certain #species such as cod, hake, and red snapper had declined by 95%.
130 2018-10-30 22:58:10 @Carl_C_Icahn Yo Carl no bid in the bank stocks. Raymond James symbok rjf at 74ish down from 95 in a month. I was the 361stv broker hired by them circa 1995. Unfortunately my boss did pay me the 150 k he owed. I worked there 6 years. If you can get in its the best brokerage.
131 2018-10-30 22:57:09 Major US stock indexes have jumped more than 1% helped by strong gains for chip and transport stocks as investors took advantage of cheaper prices following a steep recent pullback for equities
132 2018-10-30 22:56:34 Shout out to @REngdahl on @MotleyFoolMoney two weeks ago when he gave a thumbs down  to ALL the radar stocks! Classic!  

I laughed out loud!

133 2018-10-30 22:54:46 Sorry which credit company had a security breach and hid it for 6-8 months while they sold off stocks? Sorry which company was that? Also how do you get companies not to report your credit activities?
134 2018-10-30 22:54:11 Perhaps biggest hedge funds are just levered FANG stocks which would explain October. Wouldn't explain June to September though.
135 2018-10-30 22:52:26 Also has nothing to do with Disney pulling content, in a correction, people sell the expensive stocks first, I guess.  All of FANG was getting hit
136 2018-10-30 22:50:46 $FB's move is important to watch because it was one of the first US based megacap growth stocks to crash. Was 30% down enough? Speculative assets are in price discovery mode. What will mkts discover is $SPY's price?
137 2018-10-30 22:50:46 when i get my job imma start doing stocks and shit XD
138 2018-10-30 22:48:50 YO prez no bid in the bank stocks, not a bullish sign. 
Raymond James symbol rjf  at 74 down from 95 in a month. Stay tuned.
139 2018-10-30 22:48:31 On chopping block? MYB: A.) US stocks unchanged by more uncertainty... DOW: was 910points, 245 points below, 1%, 24,445... S&P 500: 0.65%, 2.641... Nasdaq: 1.6%, down 7.050.29... Boeing which depends a lot on the trading was lower at 6.6%...
140 2018-10-30 22:46:31 @Team_Vitality salut, une idée de quand seront reapprovisionné les stocks sur la boutique ?
141 2018-10-30 22:46:25 It took so much courage to show what you really feel inside because when you do it people will leave and wont understand you..you feel your all alone but it's better to be alone than being with people who shows how ridicule you are by being their laughing stocks!So keep distance!
142 2018-10-30 22:45:07 I have a PHD in DUMB when it comes to Mutual Funds, IRAs, and investing in Stocks. I would LOVE if you could recommend a book  that could help me on my journey to being educated in these areas for further financial success! Thank you! @DaveRamsey #DaveRamsey
143 2018-10-30 22:44:37 I would fortright ask agencies to downgrade india’s soverign ratings by 2 notches and the bank stocks are a massive sell as all their numbers are fudged and unreliable

I got it all planned out! 
148 2018-10-30 22:42:21 Does this mean that euros and pounds are being converted to dollars to be invested in U.S. stocks and bonds by European and British investors who see downside risk receding?
149 2018-10-30 22:41:58 Yeah, I have some occasional #pharma drugs for myself and my dogs from $TEVA. They're obviously a legit company. $NXEN future is bright, whether it "runs stupid wild" or not. #OTC people aren't a true metric of what's legit and what's not... Pure garbage stocks run wild, afterall

I want to avoid the drama that $BKY recently went through. i know of $PDN, $GXU, $DML, $BOE. Know of any more? :) @uraniuminsider @UraniumSir @BuyHighSellLow6
158 2018-10-30 22:39:08 He doesn‘t care for fundamentals what might be a sensible thing with these momentum FANG stocks
159 2018-10-30 22:38:29 I nailed this call. Turn around today as predicted #market #stocks #dow #djia
160 2018-10-30 22:37:57 They used to import these like this but I (think) the importer started sanding them off and now they just outright put cheap American wood stocks on there.
161 2018-10-30 22:37:44 But why are there no new stocks? Production issue or something else? I can't get the answer from the short video clip.
162 2018-10-30 22:37:35 Most reputable company #stocks casually dumping 30-50% in weeks.
163 2018-10-30 22:37:17 Thanks for your reply. Can't understand why the Quorn Roast pictures ever needed any plastic tray let alone black plastic. Will look out for it disappearing from stocks soon :-)
164 2018-10-30 22:37:03 Mr TRUMP,   Please stop making remarks that r unkind as stocks r taking falls & Senior Citizens like myself can’t afford the losses!!!!!!!
165 2018-10-30 22:36:15 Seems ridiculous calling no other stocks real stocks or companies
166 2018-10-30 22:36:04 nice!
167 2018-10-30 22:35:54 I blocked him when he very publicly turned on Trump over some stupid thing. I think it was bump stocks. I’ve unblocked him but he’s on mute. I don’t forgive even temporary turncoatry.
168 2018-10-30 22:35:10 We are actually waiting for you to go to prison and then the stocks will soar because there will be confidence back in America!
169 2018-10-30 22:34:26 Democratic votes will only bring Trump stocks down¡
170 2018-10-30 22:34:24 It’s based off of reported income, so as Somalis don’t report a lot of their wealth it becomes hard to account for that. Not to mention the cars and businesses/business stocks that aren’t being reported to the IRS
171 2018-10-30 22:33:00 The economy is still okay wait until it is not okay then watch Treasuries as money leaves lesser quality debt and stocks. When the bear first starts biting pple scratch their head for reasons when the bear really eats the reasons are obvious.
172 2018-10-30 22:32:34 The debt pile is also up massively. This is no zero sum game; tax cuts equals more corporate profits and higher share prices. 
If stocks go down it must be caused by Fake News Media and/or Soros..
173 2018-10-30 22:31:56 according to the left, the thirty DJI stocks represent the entire stock market performance (when it suits their narrative)
174 2018-10-30 22:30:22 What are you invested in? Me? I’m in low-cost index funds, 100% in stocks. I’ve got a pension which is partly why I’m all in stocks. The other reason? Inflation.
175 2018-10-30 22:29:39 In the stocks having Rotten fruit thrown at them?
176 2018-10-30 22:29:21 I know! Believe it or not, I wasn't trained in stocks, etc.  My father was never great with money, but he owned an investment property when I was a child. I remember him having me collect rent at 9yrs old, planting the seed of ownership & wealth back then.
177 2018-10-30 22:29:19 imagine if $BTC stays at 6-6.5K the whole time stocks crash lol.
178 2018-10-30 22:29:18 @MeghanMcCain Why always make gun control so personal and not accept that ALL assault weapons ie AR15 Bump Stocks etc kill innocent people and have no need to be owned by private citizens?  Yeah your arrogance is back as usual.  To end your interview the way you did wrong.
179 2018-10-30 22:29:07 $SPY We spent the day positioning in select stocks like $SQ $SFIX $ROKU $LABU etc. Will update tonight via my website.
180 2018-10-30 22:28:21 Stocks are gonna get corrected so hard they will think that crypto is a stable asset lmfao
181 2018-10-30 22:27:54 Hmmm. DSI on $SPX was in single digits yesterday.  I wonder what will happen if sentiment on stocks and the buck switch places.
182 2018-10-30 22:27:36 $FB At the end of the day there’s just no need to short a money machine .. plenty of blockchain weed stocks out there lol
183 2018-10-30 22:27:19 Actually enjoying the current stocks so no Dems for me 
184 2018-10-30 22:26:53 Stocks down miserably. 
Portfolio suffering.
185 2018-10-30 22:25:54 Copy that, my immediate thought was PDN, TOE n DYL, so not far off, have pretty much stayed away from U stocks, I’m not a fan of Uranium in general (but realise the power it can store and make!)
186 2018-10-30 22:25:52 U.S. stocks ended a tumultuous day sharply higher, with all major averages rising at least 1.4 percent as volatility continues to grip equity markets during earnings season. Treasuries fell and the dollar rose @Business
187 2018-10-30 22:24:51 I wish I was taught the importance of saving and investing at a young age, but it’s hard for families to do that when they’re barely getting by. I remember a 6th grade math teacher telling me about stocks but my sister spent the change I saved.
188 2018-10-30 22:24:37 Do you feel (as I do) that cannabis stocks cant bottom until $tlry hits $50's. No good reason for it, but it seems to be a proxy for the space over last 2 weeks.
189 2018-10-30 22:24:26 $CLVS Financial status:

2021 Notes was $283.0 million ($310M actual value)
2025 Notes was $291.0 million ( $276.0 million estimate value)

191 2018-10-30 22:23:59 Stocks close higher ... Dow +431 points.
192 2018-10-30 22:23:56 Not in stocks...no sir.
193 2018-10-30 22:23:32 Stocks continue to hold gains but we are approaching the 3:00 p.m. ET witching hour when they have rolled over in recent weeks.
194 2018-10-30 22:23:30 RE stocks 300 points is not a big deal going up, just when it is going down.
195 2018-10-30 22:23:23 At midday, Mortgage Bonds modestly lower. Stocks holding gains, for now. 10-yr yield 3.10%.
196 2018-10-30 22:23:18 Stocks gain as chip stocks lead bounce back. Dow +200 points.
197 2018-10-30 22:22:56 Stocks are crazily down now. Portfolio is suffering miserably. Guy in the Whitehouse want to take credit for that?
198 2018-10-30 22:22:43 Stocks open lower but quickly turn positive.
199 2018-10-30 22:22:42 Do you think cannabis stocks have bottomed? Where do you see them go rest of year? Thanks for the fun on twitter!
200 2018-10-30 22:21:55 we were down 5 stocks in a 2 stock crew battle and i took 4 :'(
201 2018-10-30 22:19:26 That was one of the most wildest stocks I've owned... made over 1500% on it and then eats the sheets a month or so later...
202 2018-10-30 22:19:06 Are the charts really broken? Many stocks have fallen 10%-30% but are still in long-term uptrends.
203 2018-10-30 22:18:44 May stocks ka ba sa GMA?  Ikaw ba magbabayad? May I ask, where is GMA Films, bakit wala pang HD Channel ang GMA? may iwanttv ba ang GMA? mas madami ba subscribers ng GMAPinoyTV vs TFC?
204 2018-10-30 22:18:31 because stocks retraced a much needed correction of 10% after a blistering 2 yrs ..and a nutz FED

in Oct 
into an election
no biggie .. no real stress except EU and China

no rally needed
205 2018-10-30 22:18:21 Complacency is one's worst enemy. We're still below 200 SMA across many stocks and indices. Tons of damaged charts. Some show bottoming signs but still look like bear flags. Take ample caution.

Know your RISK & TIMEFRAME.
206 2018-10-30 22:17:12 Okay. It'll be a rough draft. And sorry for the delay. I've been on the telephone with a transfer agent, trying to get my stocks reg. I'm hoping to sell shares into habitual planets light years away in outer space. 1 share would be equivalent to a person owning a small town.
207 2018-10-30 22:16:39 You tell half truths in your tweets for instance you said that Democrats will bring Wall Street down and your stocks will go down and that they are not for protecting our borders and leaving them open wrong wrong. Back to the matter isthe stock market had record games under Obama
208 2018-10-30 22:15:23 $SPY This is when some traders are hoping that there will be a dip to buy stocks lower.
209 2018-10-30 22:14:50 Can they put him in stocks so we can legit throw old cabbage or tomatoes at him?
210 2018-10-30 22:14:30 Je comprends votre frustration. Malheureusement, la disponibilité des articles reste toujours un sujet incertain et dépend de plusieurs critères hors de notre contrôle (disponibilité des stocks, accords avec les fournisseurs...) ^KD

213 2018-10-30 22:12:51 And just like that Toni Braxton stocks skyrocketed
214 2018-10-30 22:12:46 If I want the stock to go down, I would vote Republican! The stocks are GOING DOWN!!!
215 2018-10-30 22:12:28 $SFIX Was our only position open overnight. A good example of what I mean by narrowing your focus on select stocks to increase probability.
216 2018-10-30 22:12:24 The most bullish observation today is the fact that $FB missed and was initially clobbered only to end up 6%.. this tells me that most likely all those who hung on to their big tech stocks into $AMZN and $GOOG have learned and dumped the rest preemptively ahead of FB
217 2018-10-30 22:11:45 FOLKS IF STOCKS DROP LOW ITS MANIPULATION SO WAIT TIL THEY HIT A ROCK BOTTOM THEN BUY AND HOLD ON TO THEM ESPECIALLY GOOD COMPANIES LIKE NUCOR. ETC
218 2018-10-30 22:10:21 You better get some help to FL or you are going to loose it - people are homeless and living in tents don’t care about stocks
219 2018-10-30 22:09:25 @ReformedBroker  how quickly cannabis stocks are no longer on the radar.
220 2018-10-30 22:08:27 Keep shorting those stocks and then you’ll have plenty of money to add this to your house
221 2018-10-30 22:07:47 A Cannabis energy drink? Can you imagine a wide awake FLY stoned out of his mind pimping stocks? Oh wait............
222 2018-10-30 22:06:55 The Stock Market is up massively since the Election, but is now taking a pause - people want to see what happens with the Midterms. If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Republican. They like the Russian financial model, High Taxes & Strong Borders!
223 2018-10-30 22:06:31 What did $AAPL say to the FANG stocks? 

Bite me.

They did. And then they became the FAANG stocks.  $NFLX $FB $AMZN $GOOG
224 2018-10-30 22:05:52 Trump inherited 7 year bull market under Obama. First 2 years under Obama, stocks were up more than in Trump’s first 2 years. Trump is delusional.
225 2018-10-30 22:05:38 Don’t put out too much money in stocks under a man who has filed six bankruptcies, infrastructure plans never materialized and is running our country with Republicans under Russia’s President Vladimir Puttin’s command.
226 2018-10-30 22:05:12 If I may ask what stocks are on your radar for today?
227 2018-10-30 22:05:10 The DOW is down $2000 from its peak. And what stocks do you own?

232 2018-10-30 22:01:57 Speaking of stocks, why is the stock answer from the GOP on taxes to keep giving breaks to the rich and fund them with reductions to social services to the poor like cuts to SS, Medicaid, and Medicare?
233 2018-10-30 22:01:57 Mais je te laisserai expliquer à ta femme de ménage que la solution pour augmenter son salaire c'est de faire de la logistique pour que Renault optimise ses stocks.
234 2018-10-30 22:01:41 W/good times about to end, mkts have grown ruthless to comps that fail to deliver earnings: Stocks that miss estimates being more punished than usual, Barclays says. Investors have little patience for underperformers who are getting more punished than outperformers are rewarded.
235 2018-10-30 22:01:14 I own stocks, I do think is counterproductive to buyback stocks in an environment, where rising interest rates will put downward pressure in stock valuation and debt service will rise, buybacks is money that won’t be available for R&D or CAPEX. Don’t like bbs in this scenario
236 2018-10-30 22:00:16 Love me some beaten down stocks with bearish sentiment going into earnings. Let her rip!
237 2018-10-30 21:59:26 Bring back the stocks and Burch and put an end to this nonsense once and for all!
238 2018-10-30 21:59:17 Ummm.
Stocks haven't been on a tear lately oh mighty republican prez.
Can you guarantee that if the repubs hold the house and Senate that this "rest" won't continue.
Of course you can't. Tariffs interest rates, midterms all impact stocks
239 2018-10-30 21:58:00 Hey Dummy...you’re base doesn’t OWN stocks...but I do...and I’d gladly LOSE it ALL if my VOTE helps ELECT just one DEMOCRAT!!
240 2018-10-30 21:57:24 @jimcramer your long time follower from France. Bought many stocks in the US listening to your mad money podcasts. To protect against another brutal selloff towards closing, I shorted s&p500 worth roughly 20% size of my long portfolio at 2661. Should i stay in or close the short?
241 2018-10-30 21:57:20 Poor Donny, he’s calling the plummeting stocks “a little pause”, so that tells us how desperate he is to point us away from his stupendously stupid tax cuts for the rich and famous.
242 2018-10-30 21:57:09 this sure sounds positive for airline stocks with exposure in Asia, but broad margins are a flailing and with higher gas prices, they are underperforming.
243 2018-10-30 21:55:39 With all this talk of the like button being removed Imma gonna buy some more MySpace stocks
244 2018-10-30 21:54:26 Adding stocks that you deem to be sub par to your portfolio is actually more like dilution than it is diversification imo. But to each his own. It's mostly about the macro anyways in case of uranium.
245 2018-10-30 21:53:08 The Stock Market is up massively since the Election, but is now taking a little pause - people want to see what happens with the Midterms. If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat. They like the Venezuela financial model, High Taxes & Open Borders!
246 2018-10-30 21:53:06 Of the many stocks I'm tracking a bottom in, $IQ is near the top. The paid users are just growing like crazy. Once you got em, you can worry about monetizing them effectively. 
You just won't see me calling a bottom yet. :p
247 2018-10-30 21:51:28 Stocks won’t rally until TIPS do... market telling you 1%+ real yields aren’t sustainable at this level of debt/gdp.
248 2018-10-30 21:49:48 US markets jumped more than 1% overnight, helped by strong gains for chip & transport stocks as investors took advantage of cheaper prices following a steep recent pullback for equities. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 5 points lower at 5,767. #ausshares #stockmarket
249 2018-10-30 21:48:21 Stocks are way up starting since well before the election. Learn about history and how global economics work first before opening your trap, you dolt.
250 2018-10-30 21:48:13 Voting for the Dem will rise the stocks not lower it
251 2018-10-30 21:48:11 US stocks fell of a cliff after Oct 3. Today the 30 year Treasury yield closed at 3.364%. On Oct 3 it closed at 3.336%.  No rally at all.
252 2018-10-30 21:46:54 Plus of course the jail time for all the fraud and libel. Stocks first, then jail. Then maybe some more stocks.
253 2018-10-30 21:46:28 You said stocks were overvalued at Dow 17000!  No vote from me-1000th dumb post
254 2018-10-30 21:46:01 I'm all about the stocks. We could put him inside a ventilated box of bullet proof glass and make him endure a few days of televised mockery.
255 2018-10-30 21:45:41 Et concernant les 35h, je pense qu'un médecin généraliste qui fait 35h de consult, avec les bio, les coups de fils, l'administratif et la gestion du cabinet/des stocks tournent à plutôt 45h/semaine (ce qui est déjà plus conséquent mais que beaucoup de médecins acceptent)
256 2018-10-30 21:44:58 Any one else used Robinhood for stocks?
257 2018-10-30 21:42:08 What stocks are you looking at smart guy-your E-Trade account? We just had the worst week since the 2008 Recession! Gaslight us all you want-it's only gonna work on your followers that don't have 401k's or don't know what a stock market is! I swear you'll lie when truth will do!
258 2018-10-30 21:41:23 Just like Republicans before him fear really gets Republicans in the air! Cat. Ask yourself why? Nobody I know of stocks in the stock market. So why? Really stupid isn't it!
259 2018-10-30 21:40:28 You are on the way to bankrupting the country. Not everyone owns stocks. Average folks seeing little to no upward movement in wages. Prices are rising across the board. Market not measure of success. #TrumpIsUnfit #VoteBlue
260 2018-10-30 21:40:07 Yeah so news or it moves up? Stocks dont just go up because of an RS 
261 2018-10-30 21:39:59 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
262 2018-10-30 21:39:37 in my experience most realtors think of the stock market as the penny stocks or crypto currencies they dabbled with and lost money in.
263 2018-10-30 21:39:36 It’s quite a coincidence that this 18-year high coincides perfectly with ‘October’ after the ‘January’ where stocks peaked, and, accelerated their decline for the next 3 years. Be very careful of what you announce. I’m not your typical GOP low-hanging, mental fruit. #Laurels
264 2018-10-30 21:39:22 Like HB5542 to ban Bump Stocks that Ziobron voted AGAINST? Bump stocks would circumvent the laws that protect us. The laws we passed after Sandy Hook that have protected our schoolchildren.
265 2018-10-30 21:38:49 The mistakes I made today. # 1 didn’t of my watch list because wasn’t loving any set up #2 shorted 2 stocks that gap up w/ good news (never do this nemore)#3 revenue traded after losses # 4 choked trades after lossses afraid to lose more. Need to remember this day!!#Daytrader
266 2018-10-30 21:38:26 $ZIOP 

1) Why do so many have this odd wacky view that RJK & $XON did this evil deal to screw $ZIOP ?

2) Why do repetitive after hours losers sell much lower than all day trading 2 days in a row?

3) Are the smart holders of these 2 stocks just fewer than the dumb ones?
LOL.

268 2018-10-30 21:37:34 Those who watched this week's video may remember something like this "it seems like stocks have moved a long way, but this recent move could pale in comparison to what comes next."

Will post some charts soon illustrating this incredibly important concept.
269 2018-10-30 21:37:19 Equity stocks. I’m not smart enough to understand options, although I need to force myself to learn.
270 2018-10-30 21:37:04 I have trouble seeing currency as an investment akin to stocks.  Currency shouldn’t be this erratic. What am I missing?
271 2018-10-30 21:37:01 Hi, stocks are very emotional about every frivolous thing  (zooming up and down in price) - like a teenager (Richie) first experiencing things; meanwhile, bonds are playing it very cool and hardly moving in price waiting for something meaningful to happen (laid back like Fonzie).

275 2018-10-30 21:35:25 You are truly bringing our nation together. I am a Democrat, and you know what? I don't want open borders, higher taxes, and stocks to decline; I want a president who is compassionate, who unifies, who is sorry for his inflammatory rhetoric, and who believes in the words of Jesus
276 2018-10-30 21:34:35 The stocks are diving because you're so irrational nobody knows what damage you will do next

tax time.That should be enough.Non of their business 
How much we have in mutual,stocks,etc.we filled out our forms every year and if they want an audit they can go to my accountants & have a sit down meeting with us & them
292 2018-10-30 21:28:40 Now it is time to invest in crypto currency rather than stocks.This is because  hav a billing function that does not exist in stocks.  Dascoin will become a necessary currency for us in the future.
293 2018-10-30 21:27:55 Vaccine stocks are usually beat up. $DNDN was no exception and I don’t know that everyone didn’t see that one coming. $CLVS is an out of nowhere job.
294 2018-10-30 21:27:02 Because I find futures to be less predictable than stocks.  Simple as that.  If it ain't broke don't fix it.
295 2018-10-30 21:27:02 Yo my $XRP short today had a volatility between 0,3-0,9%. Stocks/Forex are funnier :/
296 2018-10-30 21:27:00 The stocks are down due to YOUR tariffs!
297 2018-10-30 21:25:45 Please, do you really think average people own stocks, lots of them struggle to maintain a chequing account. Even if you actually had any influence on the market in a positive way you are talking to the 1% not your voting base
298 2018-10-30 21:25:40 Did I ever say bump stocks were a good idea? No. I've never owned one. Nor would I want one.
299 2018-10-30 21:24:16 That would be easy as it is so expensive the locals drink very little and stocks are not very high.

317 2018-10-30 21:15:51 And how will we feel about that if stocks stay down, tax receipts keep going down, rates continue to go up assisted by Fed Govt funding needs and tax cuts? Talks of entitlement cuts. Not so MAGA again, but working until 75 great now.
318 2018-10-30 21:15:19 We can only hope! I get the feeling there’s a lot of games being played with stocks, shares And new business developments before there’ll be any real development... it’ll only change when they know they can monopolise the market & profits.. #CannabisOverCapitalism

321 2018-10-30 21:13:09 Interesting to note exports were listed at 28 in 2016, yet stocks today are less than 16. despite the fast start of exports now, it's hard to imagine exports can top 30.  If dry fall continues, Gov will step in quickly.
322 2018-10-30 21:12:11 Confusing @MarketWatch  hed: "Stock strategist who saw market correction now predicts 10% to 14% rally — and a fizzle in 2019." Put another way: #stocks go up, stocks go down...
323 2018-10-30 21:11:50 When everyone and their mothers are cashing in on hemp the supply demand dichotomy really becomes unbalanced.  Growers in Oregon are barely making ends meet.  There is only short term profit in investing.  Then stocks would plummet.  It’s math.  Do research.  Know a thing. 
324 2018-10-30 21:11:06 1. Except the facts show that the stock market does better under Democratic Presidents

2. #patrioticmillionaires actually want to lift the lower and middle class up because they know that it improves the economy as people can afford more goods/services of the stocks they own.

329 2018-10-30 21:09:40 I'm not in all stocks. I try to diversify, but it's still taking a big hit. And that's not even counting my daughter's 529 Plan. Once again, I really TRY to take care of my own stuff and save, but there is only so much you can control. Thanks for the advice =)

358 2018-10-30 20:59:05 After the inadequate, but far better than nothing, COLA was announced my rent went up for a total 25% increase in two years. Every time there is an increase it is immediately wiped out. Forget about stocks, savings and 401k. When you're injured or retired they disappear. Poof!
359 2018-10-30 20:58:41 Then it rallied because literally every other metric was bullish and like most stocks dying barely missed revenue. Market just panicked and technical selling. Which is bad, granted.
360 2018-10-30 20:58:35 Bogus. First you take credit for Obama's economy, then call a major market correction eliminating an entire year's gains - you've only been in office for two years - as a "pause". If we want stocks to go down??? What are you watching? You are a fraud. You're ruining this country.

371 2018-10-30 20:55:19 would this mean money will be rotating back to tech after $AAPL earning? planning ahead into next week. Definitely keeping an eye on those tech stocks if making a run before G20.

385 2018-10-30 20:49:39 Are u excited to buy stocks now? At least i am not... and probably i won't be even though market makes new high. But those who want to buy now,  patience is the key. Wait & Watch.

387 2018-10-30 20:48:45 What were the ingredients? Also, did the various stocks differ in the amounts of specific ingredients (or lack, thereof)? I ask because our family stock uses some herbs that I don't always see included in others' recipes.
388 2018-10-30 20:48:26 $UAA. $UA. $VMC, $AKAM, and $TTWO are the top five stocks that closed higher today.

406 2018-10-30 20:40:25 As economy improves interest rises. What I question is the timing of the 3rd interest hike this yr & right before election. The Federal Reserve knows STOCK MARKET goes down as interest rises! Not 2 mention stocks increases R pausing bc they don't know which party will control!

416 2018-10-30 20:35:05 Deciding on an investment without carefully considering the fairness of its

Perhaps I’d be more rational tomorrow but as it stands right now. We just became “same ole lions” again.

yes, consumer staple stocks are in the value ETF. I don't see your backdoor EM logic at all personally. EM is down gigantic this year, consumer staples are holding.

437 2018-10-30 20:27:34 Of course, the defense stocks may have fallen because of good old fashioned profit taking, as the overall market seems to be under pressure. Some keen observers might object, “Why has Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock gone up so strongly then?”
438 2018-10-30 20:26:50 Instead of looking after the Rich and giving our coastal waters to European trawlers to devastate our stocks Our government should sort the licences out fairly and when we get out of the EU do as the Icelandic's did we like them are an island race.

454 2018-10-30 20:22:47 Here is my view - a 50% decline in the S&P500 inflation adjusted during the next 3 years. A very slow grind down. No Crash.  By 2021 no one will want to own stocks - just like in 1982. Dollar down - Bonds down too. Total blood bath.

Trump inherited a shrinking debt from Obama and doubled it!
Now in Trumps first fiscal year:
Real income is down.
Inflation is up.
Interest rates are up.
Stocks are flat.
461 2018-10-30 20:21:11 It was mostly up because you borrowed from China so corporations could buy back their stocks. Another Don con.
462 2018-10-30 20:21:11 "It's that or companies that only care about shareholders."

Do you listen to what you are saying? 
Just buy some stocks and then YOU are a shareholder.

470 2018-10-30 20:18:39 Odds are they don’t Irma. The richest 10% of households control 84% of the total value of stocks. Showing once again how out of touch with the common person you really are.
471 2018-10-30 20:18:31 Foreign stocks generally flat to higher while US soars: US +1.6%; Europe flat. Too early to celebrate, 1 day isn't a trend. Still, my models suggest US stocks could rise at least 3-4 percent from current values by year-end. In any case expect a whipsaw market with much volatility
472 2018-10-30 20:18:22 Won’t be sad when you go to jail for paying people to lie.

#TrumpsGOP is so bereft of talking points on issues — pre-existing condition exclusions, soaring national debt, tanking stocks, children in cages, MAGAts shooting people, voter suppression — you rely on political stunts.
473 2018-10-30 20:18:11 I see all NASDAQ stocks as being over valued at the moment. Market conditions stipulate a wave-4 correction in elliot. You are correct it might hit low 100's before rebounding to a wave-5 run and a record high. Before we go into a world wide recession.
474 2018-10-30 20:16:59 Bought more $AMZN @ $1496 since it’s oversold. IMO Amazon’s  business has not slowed down nor does it have competitors that can take business away. It will be trading above $2,000 during Christmas season when retail stocks do well after BF sales # are released. Keep accumulating

480 2018-10-30 20:15:13 Nice bounce off the recent low for stocks. Of course one day does not a trend reverse, so not much has changed. Still staying cautious and waiting for more action to reverse the recent DOWN TREND. Enjoy the ride everyone!

515 2018-10-30 20:02:13 I did not realize how little fundamental analysis is going on in individual stocks until today I investigated one opportunity. I'm just flabbergasted at how most of the volume is literally ETFs, quants and computers.
516 2018-10-30 20:01:52 The bond market (10yr TSY) moved about 3bps today, despite >400pts ⇧ in stocks. Bonds have become Fonzie to stocks' Richie Cunningham - stocks are all "golly gee!" & bonds are "uh-huh." Bonds are calmly waiting for stocks/econ to pick a direction - it's almost awkward to watch.

518 2018-10-30 20:01:04 The Dow rose more than 400 points Tuesday, as stocks showed signs of recovering after a bruising month on Wall Street  -- The Wall Street Journal
519 2018-10-30 20:00:42 Local and foreign investors in tangible projects are also called investors, i.e. investors in the energy, telecom, chemical sectors.  Also, I take  issue with the word "feeling." Are investors "fleeing" the U.S. market because stocks have been dramatically dropping?

532 2018-10-30 19:55:17 With the market rally but $AMZN and $NFLX down/flat, this feels right. There needed to be an adjustment to a number of momentum stocks, but the market as a whole is OK,

561 2018-10-30 19:44:47 The only reason the market was doing well this year was because corporations used the 14% corporate tax cut to reduce their liabilities and increase equity through massive stock buybacks. This created an artificial demand for the stocks and drove up the price per share.

564 2018-10-30 19:43:54 It stands to reason that since Trumps election the stock market has boomed. And as Trump has helped to create jobs, deregulation of industry and repatriated US dollars, stock soared. So, if his agenda were stifled, stocks would do the inverse. Pretty basic stuff here.

591 2018-10-30 19:38:37 As they 'announce' they have bought another potential 'ten bagger' , they should 'announce' when they sell a stock. It is only fair to the followers they have spent much time cultivating in the hope that they will follow them into their chosen stocks.

607 2018-10-30 19:29:14 A little pause....Most stocks are down for the year and off 30 to 40% from their highs. Your tariffs are the #1 reason. Your decision to fire Yellen and put in Powell is #2.

In Oct 2020: will stocks crash?
In Oct 2021: will stocks crash?
646 2018-10-30 19:11:36 In the field of common stocks, the necessity of taking price into
account is more compelling, because the danger of paying the wrong price
is almost as great as that of buying the wrong issue. #markets #nifty
647 2018-10-30 19:11:29 Wow... this is a double midday reversal that could take off big time. Guess it depends if they buy the heavier weighted stocks. Over +360 might signal the worst is over
648 2018-10-30 19:11:01 Yessir, and hella stocks
649 2018-10-30 19:11:01 what if the only bt21 plushies hot topic stocks are the cube pillows 
650 2018-10-30 19:10:59 Because stocks have always had their value restored and increased over the long run. Whereas cars depreciate inevitably over the course of their existence (rare examples of classics notwithstanding)
651 2018-10-30 19:10:46 Good day for stocks
652 2018-10-30 19:10:38 US Stocks trying to bounce.
653 2018-10-30 19:09:58 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
654 2018-10-30 19:09:17 By gosh, he's right! My stocks have tanked since I mailed my ballot last week...
655 2018-10-30 19:08:40 Doesn’t matter how good individual stocks are Toronto venture exchange is selling off
656 2018-10-30 19:08:24 I’d like a bit of @peuterey for the collection but no one stocks it only the Germans 
657 2018-10-30 19:08:04 Their stocks went down.
658 2018-10-30 19:08:01 I talk about stocks that I regards as conviction buys which are hopefully based on facts. Selling HZM was based on my opinion, which could easily have been incorrect.
659 2018-10-30 19:07:57 Stocks are down, trying to get rid pre-existing conditions for Americans
#voteblue
660 2018-10-30 19:06:57 My stocks have been doing well since the 90s and I came out fine after the 08 crash. It's called good investment strategy.  Nothing to do with @POTUS.
661 2018-10-30 19:06:44 How about stocks? No half measures.
662 2018-10-30 19:06:29 I am sure stocks also exhibit vomiting camel trading pattern during the same time! Duhh
663 2018-10-30 19:06:10 The Stock Market was up massively after the Election, but investors are cautious of China #TradeWar & overvalued Stocks. If you want your Stocks to go down, I suggest voting Republican. #GOP likes the Russia model: High Debt, Bad Services for People, Low Taxes For Billionaires!
664 2018-10-30 19:06:00 Vos stocks ont survécu à la PGW ? Vous avez du vendre tellement de hoodies
665 2018-10-30 19:05:26 BUT THE TV Traders on CNBC #Halftime & #FastMoney WHO PUSHED STOCKS INCL BUYING hi-flying, nose-bleed valued Tech stocks right up to Tues, Oct 8th (THE DAY BEFORE THE START OF THE COLLAPSE)...now say, $SPX needs to lose ANOTHER $3 TRILLION JUST TO TOUCH $SPX 2532 is just stupid.
666 2018-10-30 19:05:19 @jimcramer Given the wild swings we’ve seen lately, are FAANG stocks still a good buy and hold option?
667 2018-10-30 19:05:13 didn't this kid hook up with the fox on stocks chick as well? they worked together then it got messy? Am I recalling that correctly? too funny.
668 2018-10-30 19:05:08 I strongly suggest the reason the stocks are plummeting is your lack of leadership.  Obama's steady growth is being destroyed by you . Your tariff wars, hater speeches, and lies are catching up to you.
669 2018-10-30 19:04:26 When stocks go up, it's me. When they go down, it's elitist socialist globalist Democrats. HTH
670 2018-10-30 19:04:26 I feel the same.  Thank goodness for the CP Effect on stocks!
671 2018-10-30 19:04:26 #Stocks,#Indexes Top signals continue to emerge, in unison, on track to complete probably before the close.
672 2018-10-30 19:02:54 Stocks going down
673 2018-10-30 19:00:50 Jeanette.. Out economy isn't booming.. Same the last years.. Staying even.. Look at stocks.. Trump said stock would be so hight. He would build a wall.. His main promises have not been done.. Gl with the idiot
674 2018-10-30 18:59:50 im not talking about copying as thats stupid, all im saying is if you are talking about which stocks you've bought and why then equally and just as important you should really be talking about which stocks you've sold and why for transparency surely??
675 2018-10-30 18:59:34 I don’t own stocks
676 2018-10-30 18:58:42 Really? Cause you must be watching a different business report than I am@ stocks up and pausing. They've been on a roller coaster since you began. DOH!  And your supporters must think your fake BS is real. Vote anything but GOP, cause you and team are making irrational decisions!
677 2018-10-30 18:58:36 84% of stocks are held only by the rich, so who gives a fuck about Wall St. numbers?
678 2018-10-30 18:58:24 No worries about the stock market. One can make money in it either way, up or down. Many hedge fund mangers are eagerly waiting for the market to dip to make a killing.
Presidents worry about the unity of their country and financial wizards worry about making money in stocks...
679 2018-10-30 18:57:58 That again depends on entry multiple....if entry is at very high valuation then it might not beat FD returns in 10 years...stocks like Infosys, HUL have given no returns after many years in certain span...
680 2018-10-30 18:56:05 The media & adults say we don’t have willpower,
condemning us like stocks.
Why are they killing us before we can even try (enemy enemy enemy);
Why are you hanging your head & accepting it already? (energy energy energy)
Don’t ever give up, you know you not lonely

@BTS_twt “Dope”
681 2018-10-30 18:55:30 I’m not trying to be a hater or anything but ever since the merger I’ve noticed that Superbalist stocks less plus size clothing AND they’ve starting using models who aren’t plus size to advertise the plus size clothing. #spreesuperbalist #notimpressed

684 2018-10-30 18:54:49 Hell I want both lol. I would take the money and work on my credit. Invest my money into stocks. Get some CDs for my kids and college funds.
685 2018-10-30 18:54:07 I think this is the IBD strategy, right?  they push the stocks with the momentum.  I got caught in that.  Not a good strategy.
686 2018-10-30 18:53:54 I don't have a problem with people shorting stocks. But what I see on social media and places like SeekingAlpha is a bunch of emotional angry people who use personal attacks and name calling. Not exactly the qualities of a successful investor.
687 2018-10-30 18:53:40 Taking a pause? Stocks are down on the year.
688 2018-10-30 18:53:34 @CGasparino @LizClaman - Any news on the economy, markets, stocks, etc I turn to you two.  You both are absolutely sensational.  Thank you for what you do you on a daily basis.
689 2018-10-30 18:53:02 Obviously you realize that volume is all stocks, some win and some lose... my investments are still up and the gains were cashed in... some people made a lot of money. If you are a long term investor, you stick with your picks.
690 2018-10-30 18:52:44 Stocks went up 16000 points under a democratic president.
691 2018-10-30 18:52:37 In Smaland we call it stocks
692 2018-10-30 18:52:30 Alors les stocks ont été complètement vidé ?
693 2018-10-30 18:52:29 removing my millions from the economy is what's killing stocks, kevin
694 2018-10-30 18:52:21 US stocks might ease from here
695 2018-10-30 18:52:17 Some funds/  institutions can’t hold stocks trading 
below $10 by their charter. 

Bad situation getting worse.
696 2018-10-30 18:52:06 The declined pounds typically recommends the prior stocks.
697 2018-10-30 18:51:07 Silence is the best thing and worst thing to happen to small stocks.   That's  a big part of the frustration.  Hopefully he's sell something or cutting a deal.  @G_Commish
698 2018-10-30 18:50:43 I wondered about that footage of Bobby Davro in the stocks!
699 2018-10-30 18:50:11 WALL STREETS BIG PUSH UPDATE:  Wall Street gets a C+.  Dow is up about 200 points.  Wall Street trying get everyone to buy stocks to help republicans in the Midterms.   But stocks are very risky, so they are having trouble
700 2018-10-30 18:50:05 Amen @BobPisani! #mutualfunds own 5 times as much $AMZN as #ETF. A voice of logic and reason when people are looking to find blame on why #FANG stocks are falling. The wrapper does not matter. @PowerLunch
701 2018-10-30 18:49:56 “46% of households owned stock shares, the richest 10% of households accounted for 81% of the total value of these stocks”but ... “Housing, liquid assets, and pension assets accounted for 87% of the total assets of the middle class”- Household Wealth Trends in the United States
702 2018-10-30 18:49:46 If I’d been allowed to actually invest in High School, I’d have made a killing in shoe company stocks.
703 2018-10-30 18:49:36 I think you are not looking at why I posted, it shows the 52 week stocks were lower than now. I’m not sure what you are trying to argue here, those are the numbers and your info on the stocks is wrong according to them.
704 2018-10-30 18:49:32  really while stocks last. If I freeze my eggs in the USA does that count?
705 2018-10-30 18:49:27 If you had 100k to invest!  
What would you invest in? 
- Bitcoin 
- Individual Stocks 
- Income producing property 
- Index Funds 
- New Car 
706 2018-10-30 18:47:58 @CNBC talking about how the FAANG stocks are a part of 100s of ETFs.  No wonder this tape has such a "machine" feel.  So gross... so much overhead to get through.
707 2018-10-30 18:47:34 can't spell Grandfather Stocks without G.E.
708 2018-10-30 18:47:20 What about the voters who don't own stocks...
709 2018-10-30 18:47:18 Thanks mate, you're so right, and shareholders already in such stocks shouldn't be afraid to take useless CEOs to task
710 2018-10-30 18:47:13 Hey Stocks-n-Options(@mstradingcoach), thank you for following me
711 2018-10-30 18:47:04 Stocks did better under Obama.
712 2018-10-30 18:46:26 line here is 2667-68. i think bulls want to close there at a minimum. 74 would be better. credit has been strong all day, but stocks are ignoring so far.
713 2018-10-30 18:46:07 Don’t forget awful buyers seeing their stocks get hammered on announcement
714 2018-10-30 18:45:54 Don't they use those bump stocks to make a semi automatic fire like an automatic? And how can these crazy people get hold of them so easily?
715 2018-10-30 18:45:50 Hard to say... $SPX $SPY $QQQ could make a run higher with the large appetite for garbage stocks like $NVDA $TSLA here
716 2018-10-30 18:45:05 Let me jinx it? Today going to be the first day most if not all pot stocks are green for most if not the entire day without gyrating in and out of red, green?? 
717 2018-10-30 18:45:00 ‘Stocks n socks
718 2018-10-30 18:44:27 The "rapid selloff" is based 100% on facts;  there have been only 10 times, including this selloff, where stocks dropped this far in 35 days after a peak.  The analysis does not mention the $VIX and has nothing to do with the VIX.
719 2018-10-30 18:44:04 then put those millions into bitcoin and weed stocks....mind blown!!!!

726 2018-10-30 18:42:47 I think that people will take slightly lower stocks if it will bring the country closer together like it was when a real president ran the country
727 2018-10-30 18:42:40 Hell, I dont even know the names of any.... guest I'll just try "marijuana stocks", see what I find. Lol
728 2018-10-30 18:42:15 The stock market has already taken a nosedive on some stocks like Oil and Corn and silver. As well as lesser-known stocks the only two good ones are the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 JP Morgan is doing whatever they can to avoid another meltdown...
729 2018-10-30 18:41:57 Stock values are in valuation. They are not zero sum. The money is lost from paper profits. The profits are only realized in stocks when sold. 

Futures & option contract markets are zero sum so there is always an equal winner & loser at every contract price point.
730 2018-10-30 18:41:32 Outstanding ... you should take commissions!
731 2018-10-30 18:41:27 <12 months is a trade not an investment. Selective EMs are longer plays and can't defend their currencies like China. They need to wait until the US if forced to devalue against them. If anything Chinese stocks in CNY terms (or USD unhedged) outperforms SPX in the mid-long term.
732 2018-10-30 18:41:27 Y a commercialiser et commercialiser. Mon bouquin est vendu sur bookelis dont je me sers surtout pour imprimer mes stocks à la demande. Et puis, niveau ventes, on peut pas dire que j'atteint les scores d'un best seller, même relativement à l'auto-édition.
733 2018-10-30 18:41:26 Sir these stocks in green can we buy for positonal
734 2018-10-30 18:41:19 No, stock values are in valuation. They are not zero sum. The money is lost from paper profits. The profits are only realized in stocks when sold. 

Futures & option contract markets are zero sum so there is always an equal winner & loser at every contract price point.
735 2018-10-30 18:40:59 Please keep the salt flowing. It will definitely help my stocks.
736 2018-10-30 18:40:31 Thanks for your reply. I actually bought the pennant break out and couldn't hold longer your video made sense and it's an interesting analysis!
737 2018-10-30 18:40:26 They are semi automatic which is legal. It is unclear what the Las Vegas shooter was using, likely modified or using bump stocks. Fully automatic weapons are illegal in the US without a very hard to get permit. Semi auto is a bullet per trigger pull. Still a lot o bullets.
738 2018-10-30 18:39:30 Stocks come and go, has nothing to do with the midterms. 

The real issues are health care, social security, higher education, living wage, and income equality. If you care about fairness, progress, and opportunity, vote Democrat.
739 2018-10-30 18:37:46 Stocks will plummet
740 2018-10-30 18:37:41 Google is the only stock I’ll hold for the long term #FANG stocks.
741 2018-10-30 18:36:48 Just so you know most adult Americans do own stock or stocks funds in their 401k’s or IRAs. If you don’t need to take a look at life choices.
742 2018-10-30 18:36:13 The stocks are down because you act so crazy they have no idea where our country is headed. By the way, how much are the Saudi’s paying you to cover the murder of Jamal Khashoggi???
743 2018-10-30 18:34:49 @cvpayne Charles, should we hold stocks that are solid companies but down 30% or take losses now?  We don’t need the money for the next few years.
744 2018-10-30 18:34:19 Historically stocks perform much better under Democratic leadership. Facts are not your strong suit so I suggest you do some research or if it's too hard have someone explain it too you.
745 2018-10-30 18:34:17 Left, I peefer stocks on shotguns
746 2018-10-30 18:33:46 Agreed on most of this. 

neutral he does so well. but being light weight combined with rage and lack of reliable ways to close stocks hold him back so heavily.

750 2018-10-30 18:29:52 Actually. With a Democrat (see i say #Democrat) congress and hopefully senate the country will relax and invest heavily in stocks. Why? Cuz we will address all the things you neglect so you can put on side shows in arenas. Finally will tackle infrastructure health budget #vote
751 2018-10-30 18:29:39 We have a president who advances hate and violence. He lies to the point that he believes himself. You and your colleagues enable him which makes you as guilty as him. 
NRA pimp.  Bump stocks outlawed yet?
752 2018-10-30 18:28:38 Hatred?? Gimme more of that hatred. My fat stocks, fat IRA, booming economy, more money in my paycheck, jobs for everyone. And keep America safe. Block illegals at border.  But, hey. Keep up that “Resist”. It’s “working”.
753 2018-10-30 18:28:27 Here u go again with another lie! The stock market has plunged wiping out all 2018 gains! Many people r not able to buy stocks. It’s only the wealthy u r concerned with. Ur supporters r blind with regards to ur past negative actions & ur verbal attacks at ur rallies.
754 2018-10-30 18:27:50 If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat. They like the Venezuela financial model, High Taxes & Open Borders!
755 2018-10-30 18:27:39 If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat. They like the Venezuela financial model, High Taxes & Open Borders! The American fascist
756 2018-10-30 18:26:35 The stocks went up after the election thank in part to the policies of President Obama.  The effects of Trump’s policies are just now starting to kick in. That’s why the Market is tanking.
757 2018-10-30 18:26:32 If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat. They like the Venezuela financial model, High Taxes & Open Borders! Fascist
758 2018-10-30 18:25:58 I dont see any reason to Buy Fang stocks for mid term swing long plays just yet - trading them different story
759 2018-10-30 18:25:42 “Stocks go down” is an interesting way to describe the erasure of an entire years gains.  The market is adjusting to your big government, central planning tariffs.
760 2018-10-30 18:25:23 $WMT $KO only less than few leaps (couple of PIPs) away from their 52WH  speaks volumes of the strength these almost good as cash (stocks) are.

761 2018-10-30 18:23:52 currently bump stocks make it possible to fire 60 rounds in 60 seconds

it will make a difference
762 2018-10-30 18:23:39 @pauljohnson9691 what are your thoughts on what might help #ARS to claim back shareholder sentiment and see a price rise ? . Positioning here in resource stocks could be a master stroke
763 2018-10-30 18:23:19 He already did. My stocks are doing pretty good and the economy is booming sheep. 
764 2018-10-30 18:23:11 Bonuses!  Are you kidding me.  The ol trickle down system does not work, and didn’t in this instance.  Most corporations did buy back on stocks!  Read something.  Plus if the corps get such a huge tax break it should lead to higher pay and not one time bonuses
765 2018-10-30 18:23:03 It does not directly modify the fire rate of the weapon. It doesn't.The  weapon shoots as frequently as you pull the trigger.Any semi-auto weapon can claim that. Bump stocks don't change this mechanic.THAT IS NOT  AUTOMATIC. You're being so ignorant now and I'm finished with you.
766 2018-10-30 18:22:48 Starting next week I will give one free webinar at the beginning of each month. In November I will cover the F A A N G stocks (+ $TWTR). In December I will cover the banks: $BAC, $C, $GS, $JPM and in January I will cover several foreign and domestic indices : $DAX, $FTSE, $SPX
767 2018-10-30 18:22:47 Point is things are way too negative. Strong consumer confidence. Midterms in a week and we can move on... #stocks
768 2018-10-30 18:22:02 Agreed! I can't imagine a real constitutionalist making that argument. I can imagine a whole lot of people who said "but the constitution" when people brought up banning bump stocks making that argument though.
769 2018-10-30 18:21:23 Stocks have been going up nicely since 2009 thanks to the Obama administration. Do you think you had something to do with the stocks going up? Hahahahahahahahahahaha
770 2018-10-30 18:21:10 People realizing what a right wing white supremacist whack job you turned out to be has people paused on stocks. After we vote in some checks on your idiocy, stocks will be back.
771 2018-10-30 18:21:01 If u really want to get into this , u should take a look at penny stocks in the pink sheets. There r many companies that r in trouble there. U could get a start with very small companies. Some wonder 500k market cap.
772 2018-10-30 18:19:46 The other interpretation is that a shortage of USD liquidity is preventing the havens from rallying.  Bonds initially fell with stocks in 1987 and 2008.  I don't think stocks can rally until bonds stabilize.
773 2018-10-30 18:19:24 Stocks 
774 2018-10-30 18:19:24 Bad
As of yesterday all markets were in the red for the YEAR, except one, that was up 40pts.

Today the Dow is down, about 300 point for the year.

Wallstreet is on a 6 month delay to mainstreet (trade wars, deregulation)

775 2018-10-30 18:18:58 Kirk how many stocks do you own?

782 2018-10-30 18:15:00 Stocks are going down because you do not have a clue how our economy works, you have sold us out to the Russians, Then placed Tariffs on everything the people require except for your own products Hypocrite.  
go back to school as you have no bloody clue on how tings work.
783 2018-10-30 18:14:42 Duh.   Take the time machine.  Invest in stocks or Vegas to earn 100+ million in like a day.   Then you’ll have all the true love you can handle.
784 2018-10-30 18:13:50 I'd venture to say most of your base doesn't own any stocks.
785 2018-10-30 18:13:48 Time to buy helicopter stocks.

788 2018-10-30 18:10:52 Why not? Think like Trump..mean, selfish, greedy & corrupt. Go for Vote while keeping in mind future is based on same. None of this Jobs, Stocks mkt, tax cuts or Subsidized insurance will be deciding factor. Here decision is for leader so choose your leadership.
789 2018-10-30 18:10:49 stacking penny stocks?
790 2018-10-30 18:10:31 Thanks mate. Hoping for the best. Things can change in a heartbeat with AIM stocks.
791 2018-10-30 18:10:18 Dude! Stocks are going down????
792 2018-10-30 18:09:57 And it also sounds like a lot of crying bulls again just like in Feb, that think stocks aren't supposed to go down. Disclosure: Long $SPY 
793 2018-10-30 18:09:39 And shitty stocks!!
794 2018-10-30 18:09:07 Can you ever take responsibility for anything? Stocks were going up for 8 years before you even considered running for a job you don't understand.
795 2018-10-30 18:08:14 Btw, my stock statement is not a shot at Ikon. I know better than to blame those who do not have a role in not giving equal opportunities to women. That’s all on YG for making his mistakes. What I’m presenting with these stocks is how BP has picked up YG’s slack over and over.
796 2018-10-30 18:08:13 Pre mayhem days - blue chip stocks would gap up and then flirt with EMA8 before riding the crest up on SMA21 to end green - now things have shifted downwards, they still gap up, flirt with EMA8 then divorcing it for EMA21 and then finally resting at SMA50 to end light green/red.
797 2018-10-30 18:08:10 You mean Realtors with Canadian bank and weed stocks?
798 2018-10-30 18:08:00 Instasnap is killing my snap stocks 
799 2018-10-30 18:07:33 You are talking about which stocks?
800 2018-10-30 18:07:03 Let me ask you a serious question.
Is our GDP up, Stocks up, jobs up, unemployment down?
Are we getting better deals with negotiating partners?
Is our military stronger?
If these are a problem to you, then you are obviously against the US being able to better itself.

802 2018-10-30 18:06:13 Yep, there were reports for a while that foreign investors will be pulling out and that the billionaire cartel would be buying up those stocks in a move to take over the company.
803 2018-10-30 18:06:09 Yes, bump stocks allow a rifle to have a smaller profile and help with  stabilization of a weapon while aiming. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE  RATE OF FIRE OF THE RIFLE. It does not make a rifle shoot fully automatic. And they are perfectly legal. You're being obtuse. Stop it.

808 2018-10-30 18:05:10 .@realDonaldTrump your followers are not in stocks.
809 2018-10-30 18:04:44 Stocks go down if Democrats win? You mean the wealthy will lose $. An outrage!
810 2018-10-30 18:04:03 Wooooooo I'm a investor!!!  So those tax cuts for corporations didnt result in more jobs as well?  Go sell some penny stocks Mr big pants.

812 2018-10-30 18:03:14 Let's hope we get people in congress and governors who will work hard to take on the #NRA and ban bump stocks
813 2018-10-30 18:03:10 You obviously don't know about bump stocks. Do you know anything about anything?
814 2018-10-30 18:03:08 Unless you are flip flopping stocks and need to cash out right now, you want to be in $T.

817 2018-10-30 18:02:43 Soon people will realize the companies without ICOs, who are building on bitcoin and lightning, are the ones to invest in and buy stocks from. 

Most if not all the icos that claim their tokens will have a use wont happen.
818 2018-10-30 18:02:25 Hey @KateBolduan, is @realdonaldtrump on his way to pittsburgh? im confused because he's talking about stocks & election candidates the day 11 are buried in front of Squirrel Hill close friends & family --- is he STILL going? 

Set a tone Trump. Politics arent funeral appropriate
819 2018-10-30 18:01:43 1/2  We #trade highly price-dynamic stocks #weekly on technical analytics that reveal "smart money" sentiment.  When they reverse direction, so do we.  They profit, so do we.
820 2018-10-30 18:01:37 Case you haven't looked at the stock market my stocks have gone down and the midterms haven't happened yet. As always you're trying to scare people and be a bully.
821 2018-10-30 18:01:16 Stocks are not up since you been in.. The same.. So childish you are
822 2018-10-30 18:00:57 What happened @realDonaldTrump  did your buddies stop buying up the stocks to inflate the market. ??? Maybe they finally woke up that you are s crook
823 2018-10-30 18:00:55 Stocks has been declining since trump took office, he’s a blight on the American economy and for the American people
824 2018-10-30 18:00:18 You know stocks are going to continue going down, and you know you'll lose the midterms. Anyone with an ounce of knowledge regarding stocks, knows this. But you'll use it to fool the people.
825 2018-10-30 18:00:15 A newbie in market, and an admirer. Looking to nibble in rural themed stocks in market. Can shed some light on which stocks to look into?
826 2018-10-30 17:59:54 Go after the pot stocks peeps! They should have capital gains this year.
827 2018-10-30 17:59:20 Inherited some shares from my mom and could never sell them besides that I’m 100% cash right now.  Good lesson to never be emotional even with inheritance stocks.   Wish mom had worked for Apple or Amazon. Of course neither of them were around in 1943. 
828 2018-10-30 17:57:45 Stocks been treating me good.
829 2018-10-30 17:57:39 ruin the gun for good, melting it's barrel and all the parts in the chamber.  Now should Bump stocks for the AR-15 be banned?  Absolutely.  There are other ways to make AR-15 shoulder friendly without having a bump stock.  They were terrible ideas and should be dismantled.
830 2018-10-30 17:57:34 Just a thought: what if all those 300k people on the immoral GC backlog decide to sell the stocks they own, the stocks they acquired as RSUs at once, pull their money out when the stock market is doing well.. since stock markets now seems to be the measure for anything these days
831 2018-10-30 17:56:58 @tbohen @StocksToTrade is there a way to have the major indices charts show up on STT? I cant seem to figure out how... thanks!
832 2018-10-30 17:56:51 @Fidelity something going on with options on Fidelity today? Saying "no options available for CL" but 1 minute ago there was! Has happened on multiple stocks like JBLU etc
833 2018-10-30 17:56:46 It works. Orders straight to market. Making money depends on the stocks you pick. The whole market has been on a downward trend though. Best time to be getting in
834 2018-10-30 17:56:12 Kenny Golladay, Courtland Sutton’s stocks are rising
835 2018-10-30 17:55:50 You know the overwhelming majority of Americans can’t afford to own stocks, right? Of course you don’t. You think umbrellas close themselves and that ID is required to buy bread and milk.
836 2018-10-30 17:55:49 Why should it double? Inflation feels like topping. Credit market actually doing much better than stocks lately as well.
837 2018-10-30 17:55:45 Most people don’t own stocks, Donnie boy. Want to talk about your tax cut for the wealthy?
838 2018-10-30 17:55:40 I saw an analysis yesterday that there are a few large blocks of stocks being bought with many small qtys of stocks being sold.
839 2018-10-30 17:55:04 Stocks a will go down and taxes will go up
840 2018-10-30 17:54:52 If he can do that then can’t he ban bump stocks and enforce background checks with an executive order too?
841 2018-10-30 17:54:05 If you want your stocks to go down,vote republican. The stock market has lost all gains it had for the year under Trump and the republicans!
842 2018-10-30 17:53:44 Hilarious that I'm taking classes where they ask if I would invest in a stock at a certain price or whateverthefuck as if I can conceptualize having the money to care about stocks

845 2018-10-30 17:51:36 A little pause! The stock market has lost all gains it had for the year! I repeat, stocks have gone down under Trump. It has lost all gains it had during the year! #Lockhimup
846 2018-10-30 17:51:30 YOU ARE A CORNBALL!! TALKING ABOUT STOCKS AS YOU PREPARE TO GO TO PITTSBURGH,A PLACE THAT'S MOURNING!!!

847 2018-10-30 17:51:26 Don't be lured into losing your money by falling for the old "investing on the dips" tactic in what is a clear downward spiral, particularly in tech stocks. Wait for the dust to settle following the steady drop in stock prices. There's much more to come.
848 2018-10-30 17:51:19 Buying morning panics especially on stocks that have bullish daily charts or stocks that have good earnings. That has worked for me.
849 2018-10-30 17:51:10 Instead let's find out how low has our Country dipped under Modi Government? There is no movement of Stocks, severe cash crunch, minimum credit inflow and only tangible development is Road Construction, that to on BOT basis and it has contributed to election funds, majorly.
850 2018-10-30 17:51:06 You people who lost money must be investing in the wrong stocks! My portfolio saw a big jump. You do know that markets go up and down right!
851 2018-10-30 17:50:50 Broad gains in the U.S. equity market turned global stocks higher on Tuesday after President Trump said a “great deal” could be struck with China that would relieve fears of a growing trade war between the world’s 2 largest economies.
852 2018-10-30 17:50:43 How quickly can asset class leadership change after a bad month? Oct 2008 saw a ~23% loss for stocks. 

Next 12 mos:

DFA US Adj Market 2 Index = +13.5%
DFA Int’l Adj Market Index = +38.0%
DFA EM Adj Market Index = +73.1%

Don’t avoid rebalancing just because stocks are down.
853 2018-10-30 17:49:48 Need that caravan to hurry up and get here so they can buy stocks.
854 2018-10-30 17:49:38 Chesapeake Energy $CHK making deals? Ridiculous. What they need to do is focus on paying down their debt. They talk about it all the time, but like to drag their feet. Anything other than deleveraging is simply a distraction. Learn from the past guys.  #Stocks
855 2018-10-30 17:49:08 Kenny Golladay and Courtland Sutton see their stocks go .
856 2018-10-30 17:49:06 trump knows zero about how the economy works. 10% of the population own 84% of all stocks and only 32% of workers are invested thru 401k. american salaries are lagging behind inflation, people are still struggling. GOP controls WH, Senate and House.
857 2018-10-30 17:49:00 Deficit is skyrocketing
Dollar is down
Stocks down (8%, not a bit)
Global leadership gone

Trumps next bankrupty .... only others will suffer, he will profit.

860 2018-10-30 17:48:09 The crypto market has been holding up incredibly well over the last few months. It's impressive, especially considering that markets have been dumping so-called "risk assets" like growth stocks.
861 2018-10-30 17:47:54 Ive already retweeted this poll for all to see, nothing to hide here, if you think I control all these stocks youre an idiot. And yea ive sold multiple stocks for profit. Thats the objective for everyone. Buy low, sell high. Not my fault if you just buy and hold until theyre bags
862 2018-10-30 17:47:36 Kenny Golladay and Marvin Jones stocks up
863 2018-10-30 17:47:06 Agreed, R/S will come eventually. Need some earnings reports to get better evaluations but I'd expect after some PR drops that they do more all share transactions or maybe even an offering. It will be a long term investment like most core stocks & they should reward loyalty, IMO

873 2018-10-30 17:43:14 Seems to be a trend in the stock markets?  When buying volumes are low one day, sending the stock market lower, the next day there is corporate buying going on of their own stocks?  That sends the markets higher. But temporarily, like one day. The next day it's down. Unwind that

879 2018-10-30 17:41:25 Again, this isn't theory. It's specifically about time horizons. I was referring to the long-term and you're talking about the short-term.....

If you're a long-term investor you want stocks to fall so you put more money to work at higher long-term returns.
880 2018-10-30 17:41:13 I don't build my stocks. Others stock em up and I cave
881 2018-10-30 17:40:52 Educated guess that the entire run up in cannabis stocks was 100% Canadian banks and Bay Street greaseballs hyping legalization one last time and pumping these sham stocks to mom and pop. Now dumping and planning winter vacation, no expenses spared! #assetallocation
882 2018-10-30 17:40:47 If you a biotrader, now is the time to be buying stocks of small-mid cap bios that have been cut in half from pure market fear. Buy ones with a catalyst end of this year or next. After midterm elections and feds clearing up their plan, the market will return to flat consolidation

889 2018-10-30 17:39:48 @MeghanMcCain I think you are seeing this in black and white. Future AR 15 and bump stocks sales could be banned and law abiding AR 15 owners could have grandfathered rights and keep theirs and the country may be safer.
890 2018-10-30 17:39:23 Why do I keep buying stocks, when I know nothing....

900 2018-10-30 17:36:46 I'm skeptical of that kind of manipulation for TSLA since it's so large and liquid. Low-float penny stocks are a different story, especially when a major holder can play around with borrow availability.

906 2018-10-30 17:35:18 Massively?  I think not.  Keep in mind that YOUR fiscal year began on October 1st, 2017.  The exact time my 401k began to nosedive.  If you want to see stocks go up, vote DEMOCRAT!  Republicans + economics = disaster.  Every time.

911 2018-10-30 17:33:16 Tell Trump that most working Americans don’t have ANY DARN STOCKS. “If you don’t want your stocks to go down, vote Rep?” It’s for him and his friends. America, #VoteDem and stop helping Trump make himself, his family, and his friends richer!  Use your brain!! #MSNBC
912 2018-10-30 17:33:04 .@WCXofficial is an exchange that's taking off pretty rapidly. It lets people trade crypto/stocks/fx with BTC. Same concept as 1broker except it has lower fees, more markets, and is regulated (needs KYC to deposit and not open to USA people). Otherwise I regularly use Binance.

915 2018-10-30 17:32:42 Who has stock? I don’t have stock. I have a pension. The market plays into that a little but, I know very very few people who have stocks. Unless, they too aren’t telling the truth. You just keep making  up. #Phoney
916 2018-10-30 17:32:29 It's interesting that customer sentiment is so high when Amazon and other stocks have lost almost 25% of their value in one month.

920 2018-10-30 17:31:06 First of all this is a lie. And just how many of us do u think have stocks?  Stock market does not indicate how well the economy is doing. But I don’t expect u to be able to understand that.
921 2018-10-30 17:30:45 Oui ils sont encore en train de lire les manuels d'instruction  Mais ça va pas tarder quand ils auront épuisé les stocks des "anciennes" armes qu'on leur a vendu. Quelle  #FlorenceParly
922 2018-10-30 17:30:36 29 days ago “Don’t Boo” Heller (R-Adelson) celebrated one year of doing absolutely nothing about assault weapons, bump stocks, background checks for domestic abusers, the mentally ill,even terrorists. America’s most mediocre senator couldn’t even react to a Nevadan tragedy.
923 2018-10-30 17:30:01 Stocks ARE down.  They have lost more than any of the gains this year.  Interest rates are up, jobs are down, Dodge is not keeping Ram production here, China are winning the trade war and you stand there like a king.  People are not THAT stupid
924 2018-10-30 17:29:55 I haven't seen the stocks as low until you became president
925 2018-10-30 17:29:48 This isn’t a fucking little pause.  It’s a downward spiral.  All of 2018’s gains have now been wiped out and then some.  October is on track to be the worst month for stocks since 2008....Tell the truth, Donnie.
926 2018-10-30 17:29:33 If projecting a 1.1-1.2 bil bu ending stocks, then we really only need what we've harvested thus far in terms of actual usage.

It also means that there would be no need to reduce acreage next year, so good to go, right?  Beans back to $12.  Fixed it.
927 2018-10-30 17:29:25 Yeah people always slowdown buying stocks because of elections to wait until afterwards. Pretty common.  But you’re right it is way up since 2016 elections

931 2018-10-30 17:29:03 Stocks tumbled below your starting point and your bragging confidence, dude, you can’t shit what you don’t eat. Quit fooling yourself because you aren’t fooling anyone except a handful of whack jobs #RESIGN #FAKEpresident #TREASONOUStrump

934 2018-10-30 17:28:56 Just FANG stocks have lost 200 billion of market cap the past couple of days.  

And yet #bitcoin has stayed flat. 

No money from the stock market is currently going into crypto.
935 2018-10-30 17:28:47 Prefer blue chip stocks as core positions over any resources companies. So where does Barrick get you if you've held since 80s? 90s? Resources are great speculations that has its bear and bull cycles, I guess you can say that with overall markets too, all about timing of trades.
936 2018-10-30 17:28:26 The stock market runs in cycles...of rising and falling. Anyone who attemps to profit from buying and selling stocks, and STUDIES this...there are obvious patterns re the fluctuations*  It's relatively NORMAL cyclic fluctuations..
937 2018-10-30 17:28:14 I think it would be nice to whittle the key list down to the best setups/risk reward.  It is very hard to follow 10-13 stocks for triggers/breakouts/breakdowns.
938 2018-10-30 17:28:07 The 25% tax break went to the richest and the corporations. There was very little new hiring and they spent the money buying their stocks back. Not Trump wants to find a way to get the trillion dollars back off the taxpayers and programs like Social Security and Medicare
939 2018-10-30 17:28:05 Okay okay who bought these pot stocks when Tim Seymour and Fast idiots  pumping them up what you think he was doing he was selling $TLRY
940 2018-10-30 17:27:39 The stocks are negative for the year.  It was never really you that spurred the economy, it was left over from Obama.  With interest rates rising, stocks lost everything and then some for the year, and all the hate you spew, you finally found a way to crash the economy.
941 2018-10-30 17:27:38 @BBCWorld @BBCNews @BBCNorthAmerica AMLO as people know next president, yesterday announced the cancel of the project for the New Airport, stocks exchange felt down by 4%, USD dollar gain over the Peso, and the elected president said, he is suspicious, about a consequences
942 2018-10-30 17:27:28 I hope you are right, what I noticed today is the pot stocks are moving with the market.
943 2018-10-30 17:27:12 Complete BS. Trade rhetoric and actions by the Fed chairman you appointed are putting stocks in the red this year.  Look in the mirror.  This market won't be a tailwind for your party.
944 2018-10-30 17:27:09 Can $YUM keep the trend of fast food earnings beats?  I’m less an option player and more a buyer on this one. Also, watch out for $FEYE.

945 2018-10-30 17:27:03 The stock market is up because you allowed corporations to bring back profits they were hiding overseas. This money was used to buy back their stocks fictitiously creating a stock market rally. This onetime bump will now begin to lose as investors are pulling their money.
946 2018-10-30 17:26:33 "A Pause" - Is that what I call it when I look at losses? & your Lies abt 'high taxes & open borders won't affect stocks - Dems only want taxes on the Wealthy - ..who figured out how not to pay back into the Country - as your Family. & no, Dems never said they want 'open borders'
947 2018-10-30 17:26:32 You obviously have no idea how the stock market works. The reason stocks have been going up is because of those great tax breaks corporations get they put back into their stocks NOT TO THEIR WORKERS
948 2018-10-30 17:26:06 It's easier said than done and it is notmaking light of what has been a turbulent 12mths...this is the END of a 12mth stale mate and there is a SLIGHTLY indiscriminate feel to this last 6 weeks BUT good stocks will be sought...some stocks lost 20% since July some 90%..big diff
949 2018-10-30 17:26:00 Now is the best time to invest in stocks, because the prices are low right now. These prices are not going to be low, post elections. @Olusiwale #DreamBigInvestNow

Vote Blue if you are in the middle class and care about your future economy, healthcare, social security, retirement, if you think racism, hate, and babies in cages are ok then vote for the orange lying ass
953 2018-10-30 17:25:12 @realDonaldTrump @SEC_Enforcement ..amazing the way these vicious selling programs suddenly kick in....Once again, the Fang stocks move in tandem... why? Who are behind?
954 2018-10-30 17:24:27 What about those without stocks.  How should those people .  @realDonaldTrump you just don't get it.
955 2018-10-30 17:24:18 Vous avez dévalisé les stocks sonic 
956 2018-10-30 17:24:14 À quoi bon renouveler si les stocks de médoc dans les pharmacies ne sont pas renouvelés ? Hein ? Pénurie de 513 médicaments c'est ça  ? Vraiment toutes ces déclarations et pseudos décisions n'ont ni queue ni tête  !
957 2018-10-30 17:24:07 Actually the right being slightly higher is bullish. H&S pattern breakdowns almost never work in strong stocks. But when they do work things get UGLY.

966 2018-10-30 17:23:02 Kudlow is a puppet. Stocks are falling due to this administration's obsession on tariffs and rising rates. Period. Makes me sad that most blue collar Republicans don't actually THINK and get real INFORMATION instead of believing these hucksters.
967 2018-10-30 17:23:00 I'd consider, say, universal background checks if dems gave in on nationwide conceal carry.  I'd gladly give up bump stocks for a repeal of the machinegun registration ban, for instance.
968 2018-10-30 17:22:56 El nivel de short de las FAANG STOCKS esta en maximos de los ultimos 5 años...  solo un susto de pacto trade war podria dar vuelta esto rápido
969 2018-10-30 17:22:29 It's just math. If stocks go down we can invest more at higher expected future returns and earn better LONG-TERM returns even if our short-term returns are hurt.
970 2018-10-30 17:22:13 Stocks have been going down massively for a couple of weeks now. Seems like the status quo is what you want to maintain if you want stocks to go down.
971 2018-10-30 17:21:32 Stocks hitting 
972 2018-10-30 17:21:18 trump & republicans are asking "long-term investors". to buy stocks...trump can't get professional investors & corporate executives to stop dumping stocks because they see the effect trump's trade wars are having on their business (losing foreign customers)...so they are selling
973 2018-10-30 17:20:53 IBM and GE, two bellwether blue-chip stocks, are each crashing to their lowest prices in over 8 years.  Is anyone even questioning the false narrative of the greatest economic boom in U.S. history?  Investors on Wall Street may not be, but voters on Main Street soon will be!
974 2018-10-30 17:19:37 Dude—most Americans don’t have much if any $$ in stocks, even in 401k.

All the things he DOESN’T want mentioned, that is the story.
978 2018-10-30 17:19:02 Wrong. Stocks are in free fall because investors are pessimistic about "Trump economy." All gains since 1/2018 are now wiped out.
979 2018-10-30 17:18:43 Hey @jess_impiazzi when are you coming back to sit in the stocks again 
980 2018-10-30 17:18:30 Spooky goings on in the shop tomorrow! Cakes and pumpkin pie available while stocks last! 
981 2018-10-30 17:18:08 None of that is important but, Trump is the first president to address the garbage island which if you do research does in fact effect the climate. Bump stocks and and modifiable weapon is now banned, he ended the Iran deal. Biggest economy in history, lowest unemployment,
982 2018-10-30 17:17:45 Now do bump stocks
983 2018-10-30 17:17:39 Like many middle-class Americans, I don't have money in stocks. But I do have a conscience, so I think I'll vote with that.
984 2018-10-30 17:17:22 If you don't own a bunch of Stocks, I strongly suggest voting Democrat.

When's infrastructure week?
985 2018-10-30 17:17:08 If you want the following:
- More taxes
- Higher Unemployment rates
- Weaker Military
- Want stocks to drop
- Higher Crime rates

You can make all of those happen by voting Democrat this November.
986 2018-10-30 17:16:38 Markets are modestly bouncing today. 
Cannabis stocks continue to plunge. Most of the worry seems to be around companies not having a sound business infrastructure or plan in place.
987 2018-10-30 17:16:33 So, when you invest into stocks on the high income, how does the company actually make money to pay the dividend?
988 2018-10-30 17:16:32 So then would you say that a well regulated militia, and the right to bear arms was not originally meant to speak of assault rifles and bump stocks in 2018? (Not taking a side here, just wondering how one thing can be “interpreted” and another can’t)
989 2018-10-30 17:16:10 Congrats Vic. Hope you have a warm US reception. I’d love to meet you someday but think Fed’s would ban me from entering . Own too many pot stocks. All in negative territory  Patience 
990 2018-10-30 17:15:36 Stocks would be better. Sorry
991 2018-10-30 17:15:35 The Stock Market is down because Americans are realizing just how sick and crazy and dishonest the president is, but most Americans can't afford to buy stocks because their money is needed for health care, that Republicans and Trump want to make much worse.
992 2018-10-30 17:14:58 I'm don't feel strongly about the numbers this quarter or next for $AAPL.

998 2018-10-30 17:14:17 I remember getting into a verbal argument with my economics teacher on why we aren't learning about credit and interest rates among other things. Nope we need to spend 4 weeks tracking stocks for a mock portfolio. 
999 2018-10-30 17:14:10 Stocks will go down due to Trump & his policies
1000 2018-10-30 17:14:05 Admiral Houston was supervising the delivery of Knightmares for Area11. Lord Bornstein had commanded 100 Gloucesters and 100 Sutherlands to refill the stocks of the Area. He was in a furtive cruiser, The Imperial March, as it was called.
1001 2018-10-30 17:12:40 so what you thought the stocks would always just go up? How old are you 12? Do you not know what a stock is? how they work? No? then why are you talking?
1002 2018-10-30 17:12:36 Are you really that much of an idiot? All 2018 gains have been lost. There is no massive stocks increase. A hot stock market boom from Obama ran into your admin & you tried to keep it going by an artificial bubble, that bubble is now collapsing. Sorry you don't understand this.
1003 2018-10-30 17:12:31 $GE They should start a trash collection segment. But instead of picking up garbage, they can drive around and buy back their stocks from retailers. LOL

1050 2018-10-30 16:58:41 Most if not all marijuana stocks have fallen 30-50% or more since 3 Monday's ago, today's bounce if held is peanuts.  Need a more sustained bounce of at least 15-20% to make sure it isn't a dead cat bounce.

1072 2018-10-30 16:51:51 I think there are many things that has caused it.

As far as politics-"establishment DC (both GOP/Dem) Vs outsider (Trump)
Media stocks the divide
1073 2018-10-30 16:51:42 As usual, the GOP's corporate owners have chosen to invest in their own companies, aka buying back stocks while investing in automation in order to put even MORE people out of work.

1078 2018-10-30 16:50:42 Are you that dumb or are you that Pro globalist that you state something like that stocks or not underwater give me a freaking break.

1079 2018-10-30 16:50:40 Taking that 100k easily then flipping the jet getting more bread, investing that bread into stocks and flipping houses but also getting loans and paying em off once the houses sell to build credit and still gone have dumb bread left to live off of easily!
1080 2018-10-30 16:50:32 Stocks are down from your trade war and destructive divisiveness.  Vote Democrat and restore democracy and the economy!

There is no peace.  Not in the world, not at home. No one is bowing to the strength. Most stable economy under Obama in decades. Stocks averaged +30% annually. Rump is less than 15%. Unemployment would have been lower. Debt ballooning
1083 2018-10-30 16:50:10 With this boost in income I’m getting into stocks next year
1084 2018-10-30 16:49:55 It is trading as IGCC listed in OTC market, with a evaluation of about 50 cents. Robinhood restricts a buy of this but you can sell your stocks and it will find its way to onvestors looking to buy it.
1085 2018-10-30 16:49:51 Wait, stocks can go *down*?
1086 2018-10-30 16:49:50 I think there's a difference between staying that portfolio choice matters and adjustment of stocks had feedback effects on flows and having a GE system. I think Keynes use of "unemployment equilibrium" is rhetorical to beat the frictions interpretation of unemployment.
1087 2018-10-30 16:49:49 @TweetLeni
Could you share your view on the elections? What's the risk in there? If democrats grab too much they may hike taxes? I'm just clueless, but ES_F does affect my portfolio.. Even the my stocks are on another half of the globe.
1088 2018-10-30 16:49:08 It's the tariffs. Quit being stupid and admit they are a very BAD idea.

Stocks falling because average people like me are buying used, not new, when it comes to major purchases.

Besides, the old stuff lasts longer and can be repaired.

Stockholders don't need my $$.
1089 2018-10-30 16:49:04 one of the best things I accomplished in 2018 was learning about and investing in stocks. it has been very lucrative and keeps my savings on point.

1091 2018-10-30 16:48:33 Other than Trump’s base/die hard Reps it’s beyond me why any intelligent Rep would want 2 vote 4 Reps. They’ve lied 2 you re their tax plan=only permanently benefits the rich/businesses. Reps want 2 kill ACA/Soc Sec/Medicare/Medicaid. Stocks lost all gains

1096 2018-10-30 16:47:13 The bigger problem for USD is that both USTs & Stocks are now down on the year. So whoever is buying USD is likely not investing it in yielding assets - likely speculative in nature.

1099 2018-10-30 16:45:34 Hah!  President Trump Rips Democrat Party: If You Want Your Stocks to Go  Down, Vote Democrat – “They Like the Venezuela Financial Model”
1100 2018-10-30 16:45:19 I like the thinking but I gotta say Trump is on a spending spree which limits my enthusiasm for the idea of a negative feedback between stocks and bonds. I say this even though I cheer Trump’s stance on China so I’m not anti-Trump here. His deficit though, yikes!
1101 2018-10-30 16:45:18 For pity sakes shut up. Stocks were doing great before you and will regardless of the midterms.

1103 2018-10-30 16:45:00 @HalftimeReport What if we woke up one day and investors including hedge funds etc decided they didn’t want to pay ridiculous multiples in stocks. Wouldn’t that be something!

1114 2018-10-30 16:42:52 A vote for Republicans is a vote for irresponsible spending and ever increasing debt. Stocks will continue to go down if we continue the tariffs imposed by Trump.
1115 2018-10-30 16:42:42 93% of stocks are owned by the top 20%. The vast majority of Americans do not have money to invest in stocks... they're busy trying to pay their bills...so for the majority of Americans that want your wages to increase, I strongly suggest voting Progressive Democrat.
1116 2018-10-30 16:42:41 If you only have a small account I recommended running it up too 30k and start trading big cap stocks, it is a lot easier with less manipulation,easier to recognise patterns and less fees and commissions.
1117 2018-10-30 16:42:41 Yup, $BNS hitting new 2 year lows. Only people profiting from the drops too are big institutions. I knew bitcoin and marijuana stocks would fall hard on the catalyst dates (futures and legalization) but playing bitcoin futures or shorting marijuana stocks is expensive & risky.
1118 2018-10-30 16:42:10 there is no guarantee that stocks will get doubled in 4 year in any stock, the probability of heaving a multiBEGGAR is much higher then the probability of having a multibagger.
1119 2018-10-30 16:42:07 Stocks are down because of your tariff war, rising, inflation and higher Interest rates. Stocks are down for the year and you are responsible!

1159 2018-10-30 16:31:42 Still unclear on what MaxList stocks are.  Are these stocks on lots of institutional buy lists, or something like that?  Thank you!

1167 2018-10-30 16:29:53 I know that you do not know this, but most Americans do not own stocks, which means you’re in trouble!
1168 2018-10-30 16:29:33 Many stocks down 20%. My clients don't feel like winning is in cards. Trade and Fed Reserve failing.
1169 2018-10-30 16:29:25 Bernie, really appreciate these longer timeframe price charts re: recent momentum stocks like $NVDA that have corrected sharply in the last month.  Good to see the "big picture" and your comments and notes on the chart.  Helps us navigate this recent bout of volatility.  Thank u.
1170 2018-10-30 16:29:22 No it isn't LIAR

Deficit IS projected to be highest in history however

Interest rates ARE rising

Consumer pricing is rising

Wages are stagnant

All contributors to a economic crash

We do, however, suffer from the gyrations of the irrational thing called capitalism.
1173 2018-10-30 16:29:09 Sir it's true for Dow. Not so much for Nasdaq. Barring Apple, other Faang stocks r down over 20%.
1174 2018-10-30 16:28:26 This is about the relationship between oil and oil stocks, underscoring the new dynamics of secular headwinds. Read the post if you haven't already.
1175 2018-10-30 16:27:14 Strategic is static or fixed. I think you mean tactical. That’s as difficult as picking winning stocks. In the long-run, tactical underperforms most of the time due to cost, missed opportunity, bad timing.
1176 2018-10-30 16:26:43 Maybe. The stock market might rally, for one thing. The consumer confidence survey is also more affected by jobs. Stocks weigh more heavily on the 'consumer sentiment' survey.
1177 2018-10-30 16:26:41 You have to scale it though. Insiders selling less than half a percent of all stocks isn’t going to create a $1.8t move is all.

1182 2018-10-30 16:25:39 why would anyone buy gold stocks while the Apple show is going on
1183 2018-10-30 16:25:09 Stocks have been down for 2 weeks.  Have a nice day!
1184 2018-10-30 16:24:50 The market hasn't grown since January 1 2018.  Please mention that.   That your tax cut scam meaning the buybacks for stocks drove the market up.
1185 2018-10-30 16:24:32 Old industrial stocks like $GE crashing down to $10!
1186 2018-10-30 16:24:15 No one on #CNBC is questioning whether it's time to buy gold stocks.  When the question is finally asked prices will be much higher.  By the time the answer is finally "yes" they will be at record highs!
1187 2018-10-30 16:23:57 I think imma buy some more stocks

1195 2018-10-30 16:23:13 I think midterm has more to do with general stock market than pot stocks. Overall sentiment is down, midterm can possibly lift the overall wave and hopefully it'll trickle down to potstocks.
1196 2018-10-30 16:22:55 Would love to subscribe to stocks to trade but the cost of that plus the penny stock silver is lot per month currently. I currently use TC2000 for my training as it is much cheaper
1197 2018-10-30 16:22:50 True David but not in this case. GWMO has had red flags long before Webley rocked up, so him ramping it was questionable along with other stocks and things he used to post

1201 2018-10-30 16:21:16 I think what u pointed out once must have proved right ... now u r beating a dead body  to show ur valour ... how about many such stocks where u were silent watcher like 8k mile and many more ... may be u have limited knowledge n keep tapping ur back ...
1202 2018-10-30 16:21:04 So you thought about selling your pot stocks because the big board ones are pulling back? They're trading with the Dow now that they went big time.
Historically, OTC MJ Stocks run up in November and December. This is the dip before the rip in my opinion....Just food for thought!

1207 2018-10-30 16:19:04 I think that they are playing some phony games with the Stock Market to make it seem that the economy is bad. The average man and woman in the streets don't have stocks nor do they care.

1214 2018-10-30 16:18:00 I'm sure you really don't care that rich people lost money in stocks.
1215 2018-10-30 16:17:18 Listening to Halftime report.  Not one of them claim to be heavy in stocks from the top.  All imply they own nothing and are buying the lows
1216 2018-10-30 16:17:09 Take note MAGAers - 80 percent of households own only about 7 percent of stock.  - this includes direct ownership of stocks and indirect ownership through mutual funds, trusts, IRAs, Keogh plans and retirement accounts.  Working class people don't benefit from market growth
1217 2018-10-30 16:16:17 I don't drink tea so I don't care what the house stocks 
1218 2018-10-30 16:15:48 Think about diversifying into some precious metals or their ETF's, just as a hedge.   Not a lot but just for worst case scenarios, they did well during our last collapse.  You dont want to be sitting ALL in stocks hope I'm wrong but ya never know.

1230 2018-10-30 16:12:35 Are their plans to allow puts and asks for gold price?

No evidence for 2 but plenty for 1...
1243 2018-10-30 16:08:51 You mean like stocks just did, as SPX had its worst month since Feb-09 & before that, Oct-08?
1244 2018-10-30 16:08:41 Our stocks are going down - with voting Republican. So if that's ALREADY happening - why not take the words of a politician who once said "What do you have to lose?"

1252 2018-10-30 16:05:50 Lots of Americans "inherit" land, money,  farms, business, stocks, bonds, cash, and education and knowledge  from their parents....
1253 2018-10-30 16:05:50 From a long term perspective, the best way to bet on stocks is to bet on the India story. From the current per capita income (in PPP terms) of $7000 to China's $17000 to America's $60,000, India has a long stretch to cover. It must & it will, regardless of the party in power
1254 2018-10-30 16:05:48 How many Americans actually have stocks?
1255 2018-10-30 16:05:32 REITs hitting new highs is bullish for stocks right? Lol
1256 2018-10-30 16:05:22 look, banning Nazis might make the platform safer, but it also helps twitter stocks increase, so it’s impossible to say if it’s bad or not
1257 2018-10-30 16:05:21 @DAMSConsulting $Weyl if brokers are calling around, it appears to ensure solidarity on no one buying in, if they in fact have any FTD's.  They don't give a shit about this little piss ant company. Take us to court, we have many lawyers. FYI, stocks need buying to go up
1258 2018-10-30 16:05:13 I don’t think a drop of 23% in one month is a little pause.  And stocks have nothing to do with the midterms.  How did someone who knows nothing about economics, civics or just plain decency get in the WH?  VOTE 11/6.  DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON IT.
1259 2018-10-30 16:05:11 I don't know this person 
If he has been shorting these stocks for the past few weeks and now adding to them , more power to him
But if he is just starting this because of markets and momentum , he is an idiot

1264 2018-10-30 16:04:13 Do you understand why I like my favorite 8 stocks to watch so I can see any one hit bottom and start nice bounce up on 5 minutes chart then play calls as I just follow my book “My Favorite Indicator”.
1265 2018-10-30 16:04:12 Until stocks are low enough for us to relocate ... hopefully before Dec 24 at 4pm

1271 2018-10-30 16:03:19 true: the vast majority of US dont have a 401K that matters or if they dont only care if they also lose their job - ie UER3 soars to 8% - and they dont care, on the otherhand, if market soars, there is no "wealth effect" from stocks.  There is some wealth effect from housing

1295 2018-10-30 15:58:24 So true.  There's some great athletes at the D2 level.  As I have told the boys, it's all about where you feel "at home"
1296 2018-10-30 15:58:11 How do you select stocks for this.. Can we work on a list of high beta stocks.. Any suggestions.. Pls
1297 2018-10-30 15:57:43 Buy and hold: GE stock - one of 12 founding Dow component stocks in 1896 and part of the index for 110 years until last June - now back at the same price where it was in 1995... (helping the smoke-and-mirrors Dow to keep going up constantly by continually jettisoning any dogs...)
1298 2018-10-30 15:57:30 Stocks were up under Obama & Clinton too. So your claim makes no sense
1299 2018-10-30 15:57:25 @sahneydeepak please send me your shortlisted stocks too... thanks in advance
1300 2018-10-30 15:57:21 The stock market went up during your first year, when you still hadn't enacted any of your policies. Now that you and the GOP have enacted deregulation and tax cuts for the rich, stocks have given back all the gains of 2018.
1301 2018-10-30 15:57:08 Think there was some suggestion stocks will be shorted on T basis and will be covered when it all returns from BF but I’m not close to the detail or know how the mechanics play out for these kind of things .
1302 2018-10-30 15:56:17 I love stocks so much. Like it’s so interesting to me. I recently bought a partial stock from Twitter and just watching the market work it so cool.
1303 2018-10-30 15:56:00 Well... I bit. Had cash on the side and back in now. Heavier in RETL. Also positions in TNA, SPXL, DUSL, SOXL, LABU. And select stocks. Had been in BRZU and LBJ from earlier. Watching YINN and CWEB.

1307 2018-10-30 15:54:38 Actually, not at this stage. Looks like this clip was recorded right at the beginning of the '29 crash. Ben wd enter when stocks were cheap. He wd be wiped out (thanks to leverage) as stocks wd go from cheap to ridiculously-priced.
1308 2018-10-30 15:54:29 It would be a little difficult for u, I think, to prove ur point empirically. Currently you have full gun rights, you can buy enough guns and bump stocks to kill 58 people from 500 yards away. And yet you have as little freedom right now as you have ever had in our 200yr history.
1309 2018-10-30 15:54:20 Lol it’s called you’re a shit president and the stocks are going to hurt because of it
1310 2018-10-30 15:54:02 People who own stocks know this is a lie. Stocks aren’t “paused,” they’re down. Bigly.
1311 2018-10-30 15:53:49 US stocks back at the highs of the day and again little news.. Markets remain very nervous and wild swings still look likely..

1327 2018-10-30 15:51:32 Is this financial advice aimed at your rich donors, or the rest of your supporters who don't own any stocks?
1328 2018-10-30 15:51:23 Well I know im not wrong so...theres that.  Not all stocks have gone down during that same period..a little more research and you'd know that.   see ya
1329 2018-10-30 15:50:55 Thought I was quite measured.   You are writing on the "left" media, correct?  Stocks?  The broker handles that.
1330 2018-10-30 15:50:34 I love my herb & I'm on a first name basis with my budtender. But dilution is a sickness. I've seen it too many times & they hook you with hopes & dreams. How awesome to be rich with marijuana stocks! But it will take at least 5+ years of holding it & an R/S or 2 before it works.

1336 2018-10-30 15:50:01 Pls exit the stock.., invest in some good quality stocks and recover your losses. It might fall very bad after results. Don’t get married to a stock.
1337 2018-10-30 15:49:51 Stocks are down and you are the President. Losing all the gains from the beginning of the year is not a little pause.
1338 2018-10-30 15:49:07 there are plenty of stocks that have gone up during that same period...I'm not doing research for you though.  all it takes is a little digging

Currently shorting the market.

Thanks for the tip!
1341 2018-10-30 15:48:31 Stocks have to take a huge plunge every now and then so the rich can gobble them up at a discount. It’s about widening the wealth gap. Duh.
1342 2018-10-30 15:48:27 Stocks turn lower again led by Nasdaq futures. DAX down over 1% now.

1345 2018-10-30 15:47:58 the only way i can see your scenario playing out is if yields rise too fast and stocks crash badly. then the Fed may step in. otherwise it's bye bye carry trade

it may literally be what accelerates the $'s move upward
1346 2018-10-30 15:47:47 Just to clarify--the entire government is now under Republican leadership, and when stocks are good, it's because of Republicans. But when they take a tumble, it's because Democrats? Got it.

1350 2018-10-30 15:46:31 Global stocks have lost approx $10 trillion this month, most in 10 yrs. -BBG
1351 2018-10-30 15:46:27 GE cutting its dividend is yet another dead canary. As interest rates rise and the economy slows, many more stocks will be slashing their dividends to pay their creditors. Many companies will be unable to pay their creditors, resulting in a wave of defaults and bankruptcies!
1352 2018-10-30 15:46:02 Yes. For example, you can check the stocks whose results going to be declared this month.

1374 2018-10-30 15:38:21 It’s not realistic. Look at U.S. national debt - the highest it’s ever been. No understanding of the basis of economics, you’ve had multiple bankruptcies. You spend millions on rallies, military at borders. For the 50th time only 50% benefit from Stocks! @CNN

1383 2018-10-30 15:35:27 A huge number of stocks are holding support for now, for instance AMZN at 1500.  Decisions, decisions, Buy? or go with the charts which say the markets rolling over? My guess is the markets are rolling over.
1384 2018-10-30 15:35:15 Want your stocks to go back up? Want steady reliable growth? Do NOT vote GOP. 
The uncertainty you see is because of Donald's ill advised tariffs, NOT because the Dems will destroy the strong economy Obama built over eight years in office.
Donald is the problem.

1409 2018-10-30 15:29:37 Why? That is a bad debt expense for the hospitals. It is not like the state is making them whole for it. The whole reason hospital stocks surged with ACA was reduction in their bad debt expense. They were already treating the uninsured patients, didn't get a big bolus from vol.

1419 2018-10-30 15:27:16 Actually stocks increased at a greater rate under Obama and we didn’t have this roller coaster effect, and we had an honorable president who knew what he was doing. This is pure bullshit to say Dems want open borders & Venezuela model.
1420 2018-10-30 15:27:14 Two things are very obvious about this statement.  1) Stocks are about to go down and 2) You think the Dems are about to win big next week so you’re planning to blame them for the stock msrket’s inevitable plunge.
1421 2018-10-30 15:26:30 3D Systems Corp (DDD) up 3.7108% 16.21 per share #stocks
1422 2018-10-30 15:26:08 Stocks are being dumped stable genius.  Fake news from trump
1423 2018-10-30 15:25:46 NEW YORK — Strong results from major companies including Microsoft and Visa helped U.S. stocks bust out of another losing streak Thursday. The rally wiped out part of the market's plunge from the day before, but stocks are still down sharply over the past three weeks.
1424 2018-10-30 15:25:42 Stocks have already gone down..all of the gains for 2018 are gone
 Stop with the lies!!!!!!
1425 2018-10-30 15:24:58 The Stock Market is up massively since the Election, but is now taking a little pause - people want to see what happens with the Midterms. If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat. They like the Venezuela financial model, High Taxes & Open Borders!
1426 2018-10-30 15:24:50 I am going to stop whining that the media keeps turning to pundits for advice on what to do about stocks now when those same ones didn't see the decline coming. Of course, some people did like Mike Wilson.
1427 2018-10-30 15:24:43 Surely when politics are involved it’s always about political gains.  While it’s not like Savage in the 30s it is a defining moment for this time.   After years of running down housing stocks Oppn and now being shown up they had to attack somewhere.
1428 2018-10-30 15:24:25 You wish! Stocks are plummeting
1429 2018-10-30 15:24:22 tangina mo hihihi cancelled pa ang is busit ubusan nanaman ako ng stocks
1430 2018-10-30 15:24:10 Thanks for this. I need to do something. I hesitate to eat fish, not knowing what I am doing to stocks. But as regards weird shit out of the ocean? Bring it on!
1431 2018-10-30 15:24:07 it's odd. dealers and brokers stocks soar significantly in the last several sessions, several of them even doubled...not a sign of increasing stress,imo
1432 2018-10-30 15:23:57 About 45 min ago: "Lakewood's Bozza said to short three cannabis stocks- $TLRY $ACB $CGC -adding, "it's not a matter of if, but when these pot stocks collapse." 

I don't disagree $TLRY FV is lower and while we bot $ACB for a trade, it's rich too.

IMO $CGC best-in-breed fwiw.
1433 2018-10-30 15:23:50 Nope
1434 2018-10-30 15:23:40 I like that. That's how I trade stocks and options. That's a good way to think about the broader picture and them keep studying until you find the right emtry.point into the right equity,option,derivative..etc. thanks for the advice I appreciate it
1435 2018-10-30 15:23:30 its like a game people, look at my pin tweet. just play the game. wins and losses. pick and choose. this can be a ton of fun if you enjoy this sort of puzzle work. #options #stocks #money #income
1436 2018-10-30 15:22:58 Also you took the time frames to fit your bias. 3d and 2m. Wtf?
At btc we compare daily with stocks weekly at max to see correlation.
1437 2018-10-30 15:22:54 If you take credit for stocks going up on your watch (which you have) you have to accept the blame too when it does down. You can't have it both ways. Also, EVERYTHING you say about Democrats is a lie.
1438 2018-10-30 15:22:36 Doubt it. I’ve called Arso and was told a month ago two MPs were having a look at it and mid-Oct for permits. then two weeks ago where I was told it was days away. #AST Arso are open for calls tomorrow...... +386 1 478 4000
1439 2018-10-30 15:22:24 I would rather see my couple of stocks lose some money, than have your spineless supporters in congress
1440 2018-10-30 15:22:15 i gotta get into stocks
1441 2018-10-30 15:21:46 Corrections make strong stocks very easy to spot. 

Keep an open mind.
 It's a market of stocks. 
Not a stock market.

List of some good ............
1442 2018-10-30 15:21:45 Stocks down. Voting Blue Up and Rising.
1443 2018-10-30 15:21:41 Historically, stocks perform better under Democratic administrations.  That’s a fact.
1444 2018-10-30 15:21:26 My stocks are down over the last 3 weeks.
1445 2018-10-30 15:21:12 You can see that the Trump effect is starting to take hold. Remember when Obama blamed bush for the down turn and the lasting effects of the great recession. Same idea, trends take time. We are starting g to see the trump trend now with the stocks collapsing.
1446 2018-10-30 15:20:40 All of the gains from this year have been wiped out. Anyone who actually owns stocks or stock funds knows that.

1452 2018-10-30 15:19:48 Stocks go up & they go down that's the nature of the beast. A lot driving the market now is the fear of Democrats retaking the house & killing President Trump's regulation roll backs. Democrats want to drive the GDP back to 1% instead of seeing the country economy grow.
1453 2018-10-30 15:19:40 i think stocks bounce for a few days here

and i'm a buyer of great stocks at these prices
1454 2018-10-30 15:19:25 Pot stocks finally coming down from their.............highs 

$CGC $MJ $TLRY $NBEV
1455 2018-10-30 15:19:21 But they don’t make their money from that Salary.  They make the money by passing laws that benefit them.  They should be required like I am a low level federal employee to not hold stocks in companies I can effect financial (for me that’s your Boeing’s and shit like that)
1456 2018-10-30 15:18:32 I’m not saying he’s been bad.  I’m saying that he’s taken credit for the run up in stocks based on hype, which he pointed out when he was a candidate. Market doesn’t go straight up forever.
1457 2018-10-30 15:18:26 If #trade negotiations at the G20 summit between #Trump and #XiJinping, are unsuccessful, the #US is prepared to expand #tariffs on remaining Chinese goods. Concerns about the intensifying #tradewar have resulted in stocks erasing gains, S&P down 1.7%, #HangSengIndex down 0.91%.
1458 2018-10-30 15:18:19 When you say “now is a good time to buy stocks” you do mean, extra Oreos and Kitcat bars so that I can sustain myself without leaving my house this winter, right?
1459 2018-10-30 15:18:08 We’re taking Thomas’s advice and diversifying some stocks.

1465 2018-10-30 15:17:05 Stocks are already down - and not due to Dems - due to your tariffs.
1466 2018-10-30 15:16:47 Well the stock market is up because your #TaxScam allowed corporations the opportunity to buy back their stocks. Kinda of a artificial way of boosting an economy that was already doing well due to @BarackObama

1468 2018-10-30 15:16:26 More likely on Fed hikes and stocks, per Trump tweet quoting strategist saying Fed backs off could lead S&P 500 to 2,800-2900. Let's say 6 month timeframe.
1469 2018-10-30 15:16:24 The answer is better gun control.  Other countries have done it, so can we!   No one should possess an AR15, or bump stocks, or semi-automatic weapons that have huge ammo clips.  Those are not hunting rifles.  Come to think of it, no one needs those either.
1470 2018-10-30 15:16:20 Because stocks were just horrible under Obama??   No..  they they rose 149% under Obama...
1471 2018-10-30 15:16:10 I agree 100%.  I said it at the time that they were so wrong.  So, they bought all this Daewoo and Non U others at Market highs and sold prize Uranium stocks at all time lows that even the most uneducated on the sector knew would rebound and rebound hard and soon.
1472 2018-10-30 15:16:06 Because interest rates at the Fed is going up, so it's getting expensive to borrow money to buy mega stocks, that's why the market tanked.
1473 2018-10-30 15:15:45 Stocks down nearly 10% inside of a month. Since you’re the king of taking credit, take credit for that.
1474 2018-10-30 15:15:40 When every granny is talking about bullish economy and rising stocks, it means the end is near.

1478 2018-10-30 15:15:20 When the market is good it's all because of trump...  When it's bad it's all because of anything else.  (FYI. stocks fell yesterday because of the continuing trade war with China.)
1479 2018-10-30 15:14:49 So I don’t really splurge on materialistic things anymore...  instead I find myself splurging on investments, stocks, and crypto. 

Definitely a sign of #adulting !

1480 2018-10-30 15:14:23 Many voted for #Trump cause he was supposed to be a populist & make #stocks go down. Now he is telling us to vote #Democrat
1481 2018-10-30 15:14:22 Cp24 set up mother to cry against illegal legal cannabis market the government set that up to promote their cannabis stocks investors are morons to trust in illusionary profit
1482 2018-10-30 15:13:58 Stocks struggling to build any momentum. People still dazed by the speed of the correction. Not much has changed in 30 days other than stock prices.  Earnings are spectacular and the economy is strong with low inflation. Rates at 3.1% isn’t going to hurt anything.
1483 2018-10-30 15:13:49 The stocks are already down below last year. How much lower is still winning to you?
1484 2018-10-30 15:13:28 Less than 50% of households own stocks.
1485 2018-10-30 15:13:16 I don't really want to be long stocks for more than a half hour until the midterms are over.
1486 2018-10-30 15:12:59 Stocks ? Lol well@they are still going too arabia yikes. I bet continues
1487 2018-10-30 15:12:34 Just small stocks, building capital until I can do more lol

1492 2018-10-30 15:11:09 Yea, so you gave Corps big tax breaks, they bought back their own stocks..  and called that a victory when it did little to help the middle class or poor
1493 2018-10-30 15:10:44 Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be starting RECIPROCAL TAXES so that we can be proud of – and if we show any weakness, millions of people who work within

1501 2018-10-30 15:08:29 Stocks are already down - I don’t need to wait until after the election for that. How are you coming on those middle class tax cuts? Will that be by executive order too? At some point you might want to check the deficit.
1502 2018-10-30 15:08:22 Armed guards everywhere-but no gold
Bank of Canada worst failure was its complicity with Liberal government in selling off Canada’s emergency gold reserves.

1503 2018-10-30 15:08:03 I want my stocks to go down, so I'm voting Democratic. Thank you sir for the tip.
1504 2018-10-30 15:07:59 The fall in stocks is solely due to your poorly thought out trade war and tariffs. You know nothing about economics and the coming crash will prove it.
1505 2018-10-30 15:07:58 It was mostly the overall market today, since I enjoy the down stocks much more, its generally not an easy day for me when all the gap downs close the gap and go green

1508 2018-10-30 15:06:43 The stocks are already down.  All of the gains that were made this year are gone.  This is not a pause it is an active decline.  The bull market that you though you were going to ride into the sunset may just be over!!

1510 2018-10-30 15:06:15 On the other hand, his shortfall versus international stocks was also far less than under Obama.
1511 2018-10-30 15:05:59 Stocks did better under Obama beating historical avg, but lagged intl stocks by 14.4%, or huge 16.6 percentage point shortfall vs historical avg.
So after after year one of Trump, U.S. stock returns are besting the historic average but are lagging Obama’s first year significantly
1512 2018-10-30 15:05:59 @POTUS - ECON LESSON OF THE DAY: Stock market recovery began under Obama in 2009; it mostly benefits wealthy/Corp.; the top 10% own 52% & an avg. of $1M in stocks; 40% avg. $132K in stock; 8% avg. $54K in stock. Most middle-class do not own stocks & Econ. divide is expanding.
1513 2018-10-30 15:05:54 I’m sick and tired of guys telling me that when people pull money out the stock market it vanishes.

that money moves into gold, real estate,  pay off loans and it buys bitcoin.

you know I know that’s when I sold my stocks I bought bitcoin
1514 2018-10-30 15:05:35 INVESTORS FLEE TECH STOCKS, DRAGGING DOWN U.S. INDEXES

Today, seems rather "risky."
1515 2018-10-30 15:05:08 agree completely. Only a handful of names are going to come out of this as legit worthy companies/stocks. There will be lots left beheaded  lol
1516 2018-10-30 15:05:07 My stocks recovered from Bush era disaster and rallied under Obama, which you inherited your first year. Now, it’s all on you, and NOT looking so good.
1517 2018-10-30 15:05:06 Not problematic at all. 

Close the gun show loophole = common sense.
Waiting period = common sense.
No bulk gun purchases = common sense.
Making bump stocks illegal = common sense.
1518 2018-10-30 15:04:49 The stocks are going down and the Republicans are in charge.  Explain that nimrod.
1519 2018-10-30 15:04:40 The stocks we own in my husband’s company lost about $100,000. They’ll recover, but it is depressing as hell right now. We were going to exercise some options to help our kid get a car, but that’s on indefinite hold now. Had a good chat with her about investing though.
1520 2018-10-30 15:04:18 His stupid trade wars are wreaking havoc on stocks but, hey, let's blame the Fed. If they don't raise interest rates inflation will get out of control--add this to higher food prices because of trade wars and people are going to have a rough winter.
1521 2018-10-30 15:04:04 About right yet what they fail to realize is if the founding fathers had known that one day there would be assault rifles such as the AR-15 accessible to the public and those bump stocks that many kept on the streets using this they probably would not have included it.
1522 2018-10-30 15:04:04 Pot stocks are not looking good right now 
1523 2018-10-30 15:03:55 @realDonaldTrump how can a president be so oblivious to reality? stocks down 20%+ in a month because of your trade war with the world. nothing really getting done. they're going back to 2016 levels until you stop.

Only "election neutral" trade are the cryptos that are safe knife catches, at these low prices : ethereum & litecoin. No possible bad election outcome for them
1527 2018-10-30 15:03:33 The worst October for stocks in over a decade. The market is down over 1% for the year- wheres the braggart now? Called this earlier- you are an easy read- worked with gutless leaders like you before- take all credit and gloat then pass blame and hide when shit hits the fan
1528 2018-10-30 15:03:13 To clarify, this will never be applicable on any money invested? What if some of your investments are in bank stocks?
1529 2018-10-30 15:02:52 Some more TRASH coming from your mouth ”DUMP TRUCK TRUMP”There is ABSOLUTELY no proof that the stocks will go down if the Democrats win the HouseI’m willing to bet that they will go up after the Democrats get eliminate of your tariffs7 Days until House turns BLUE
1530 2018-10-30 15:02:47 45 have you looked at our stocks.  All Tech stocks are a disaster
1531 2018-10-30 15:02:40 I sold about a month back. Although whenever I have tell people I've sold stocks I normally get attacked, saying I'm trying to de-ramp etc.

1535 2018-10-30 15:01:30 The Market went up during your time in office because of two things.

1. Momentum from the work President Obama did.
2. Tax cuts.

The tax cuts went to corporations buying up their own stocks. That's created a huge (Yuge) Market bubble.
1536 2018-10-30 15:01:18 LIES IN THIS TWEET: 1. The stock market is up massively. 2. The stock market will stop for #chumpTrump. 3. Stocks will go down if you vote Dem. 4. Dems like Venezuelan financial model, high taxes and open borders.

1544 2018-10-30 14:58:55 New leadership smells very defensive. Stocks that held up well in back half of 2008 like $WMT and tobacco stocks.
1545 2018-10-30 14:58:45 Best part of my day? Getting to talk about video game stocks like #TTWO and Red Dead Redemption 2 with @jimcramer

1547 2018-10-30 14:57:49 IMO the equity fall (and DoD stocks in particular) are all political uncertainty related rather than fiscal related.  If R's holds both houses (I expect them to) they will fly higher.  And if Ds gain the house the market will remember that Obama dropped more bombs than anyone.
1548 2018-10-30 14:57:46 if not then its totally fine too. i hope stocks are still available in a few days time><
1549 2018-10-30 14:57:44 Sugar production in India and globally has seen a sharp cut from the earlier estimates. Plus ethanol regulations by the Govt seems to be hugely positive for the sector. See some good potential from listed sugar cos. #markets #Investing #stocks
1550 2018-10-30 14:57:31 Sir, how did you select these stocks?
1551 2018-10-30 14:57:25 I definitely want stocks to go down. Go blue!

1556 2018-10-30 14:56:25 Anyone can make money in a bull market...
This applies to every area of life
It's how you deal with the recession, whether it's in your relationships, stocks, crypto, real estate, etc that makes or breaks you & ultimately sets you apart from the rest.
Be careful who you listen to
1557 2018-10-30 14:56:22 just a question did the Republicans ever get rid of bump stocks...maybe after the election
1558 2018-10-30 14:56:20 I have sold stocks but only to buy other stocks that now look better value
1559 2018-10-30 14:55:30 Over 90 years of pure analysis PROVES that stocks go higher under Democratic presidents.  Obama doubled. Bush Jr fell 24% over his terms.
1560 2018-10-30 14:54:38 My 2 cents: shorter the better on Key List, only the best of the best potential candidates. You mentioned the other day a "short list" yet it had 22 stocks on there.  I thought what's its like when the market is better.  Video is awesome.
1561 2018-10-30 14:54:12 All the hedge fund hideout stocks have been getting hit the worst.Expecting many to close after all of this.
1562 2018-10-30 14:54:08 Under you Donny boy since January the stock market has been up and down. We recently had biggest drop in the market in one day for years. A highly volatile market not a good time to invest in stocks. Your tariffs haven’t helped to steady the market! Unsteady market under you!
1563 2018-10-30 14:53:52 Hm, Guess its time to check on the canned food stocks ?
1564 2018-10-30 14:53:38 with less than 2 sessions left, these stocks really need a half decent bounce to close out the month.  If we go out around current levels, its gonna post one fugly looking bar on that monthly chart.
1565 2018-10-30 14:53:31 .@TheStalwart Now they're rotating out of cannabis stocks into Twitter.
1566 2018-10-30 14:53:28 @realDonaldTrump Fool! Your base doesn't own stocks. They can barely pay the rent at the trailer parks.

1576 2018-10-30 14:51:41 Correct.  That was never in question.  Question has always been "How soon will USD shortage impact the entity most short USD's, with the biggest 12-mth roll - the US govt?"  DoD stocks collapsing yesterday perhaps a hint we're getting to pain levels?
1577 2018-10-30 14:51:34 Martin I’m curious what you and your followers think what happens to the financial markets (bonds, stocks, real estate) after #DECLAS considering the current system depends on trust and exponential growth to survive.
1578 2018-10-30 14:51:11 event: Trump's human rights executive order.  next for stocks: further downturn, as Saudi pulls investments from U.S.
1579 2018-10-30 14:51:01 Good advice but probably too late for that now, most of those stocks have already taken a hammering.

1581 2018-10-30 14:50:45 Trying to earn media off of bad news as well as good news is part of an asset class growing up. You wouldn't believe how many "Stocks are tanking. Talk to my mutual fund manager" press releases are sent
1582 2018-10-30 14:50:31 1/2 Remember how the GOP Tax Scam was supposed to lift our economy and create jobs for a generation?

"all the good news from the 2017 tax cuts already is in the price of stocks, leaving investors searching for a new catalyst to drive the market higher."

1583 2018-10-30 14:50:30 It is crashing down around you, politically and economically - stocks are going down due to your Tariffs - that what real economist tell us. You continually LIE to save your skin from the market falling under your watch.  When up you win - Down you lose!

1587 2018-10-30 14:49:40 So my losses in my stocks and 401k are Democrats fault and not the most ridiculous trade war in history? Someone needs to check his ego.

1590 2018-10-30 14:49:29 #crypto might pump after the dump for two indirect reasons:

1- People sold crypto to make money of the #AppleEvent stocks for short term targets
2- Bitmex and/ or other future contracts provider like Cboe have dumped to take few longers out so they can profit and manage better
1591 2018-10-30 14:49:13 Fake news.  I don’t give a dam about the stock market.  The average American can’t afford stocks.  Just u

1597 2018-10-30 14:48:06 Just gotta say this: Anybody who doesn't like these wild markets and the bearish price action is holding too little cash. These are the times when you can get stocks beaten down to an attractive buy price,
1598 2018-10-30 14:47:58 Huh. I wanted stocks to go up but under Trump they crashed.  I think try my chances with democrats.  Paying fair taxes so that our children get a good education, good healthcare and streets and towns safe from racissm.
1599 2018-10-30 14:47:53 How ridiculous to blame the Dems for the stocks going down. You took full credit for the market going up, so the decline is also to your credit. So typical of you to blame someone else.

Why does nobody blame the machines when stocks rise
1609 2018-10-30 14:46:29 Lol. I KNEW you’d say that even though stocks have been stumbling since last spring when you first announced your tariffs. The market tried to stay optimistist. “He doesn’t really mean it, right?” but reality is setting in. You just can’t acknowledge YOU are tanking the economy.
1610 2018-10-30 14:45:14 This man really just said he’s sick of Trump “because his politics are having a negative effect on my stocks”.......white men continue to be garbage every single day
1611 2018-10-30 14:45:12 Immediately prior to the recent sharp drop in stocks, the number of Americans expecting stocks to decline in the next year was at its lowest since 2007. This is very bearish as retail investor sentiment is one of the most reliable contrarian indicators at major inflection points.
1612 2018-10-30 14:45:03 I hold a number of stocks that you do and am feeling the pain hugely over the last few days. You hold quality stock that have not had any change in fundamentals. The market will turn (bloody soon hopefully) and it is "always darkest before the dawn".
1613 2018-10-30 14:44:59 Prices may deflate a bit as they increased the number of total shares. Earnings report Nov 6 will make or break it for us 
1614 2018-10-30 14:44:57 I dont think crypto traders have that much capital, and stocks getting rekt will trickle into crypto. The good thing is, crypto has different investors, bad thing is, we also have alot of panicking wall st suits.
1615 2018-10-30 14:44:50 No; #stocks quit soaring because soaring stock prices while incomes near-flat and a very high percentage of current worker incomes nil always was an unsustainable bubble.
1616 2018-10-30 14:44:45 Stocks have gone up since the crash of 2008  which was caused by corrupt people like you and the @gop . Thanks Obama ! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2018
1617 2018-10-30 14:44:43 Stocks that have power to move the global stock markets are at levels where they can go sideways or even slightly down depending on how $AAPL holds after its ER - even if it is good market sentiment is subdued wouldn’t be surprised if it  to $192 - wishing for $280 though :)
1618 2018-10-30 14:44:37 A little pause @POTUS? That's a understatement! The #StockMarket #Dow has lost everything gained in 2018!! #Trump #Stocks #NYSE
1619 2018-10-30 14:44:35 So your saying if the people don't want the stocks to go down more we need to vote for who you say? In America we are free to choose    how we want that is how the land of the free works..

1662 2018-10-30 14:36:13 You really do tweet a lot of shit don't you . How bout "the last two years have seen the residual growth of Obama policy, but 2 years of Trumpism are now seeing stocks slide and #USA heading for bankruptcy; like most Trump  Businesses... Sad."
1663 2018-10-30 14:36:09 U.S. stocks rose Tuesday,helped by a rebound in tech stocks after several volatile sessions,amid optimism over the U.S.-China trade dispute & some upbeat earnings reports.
1664 2018-10-30 14:36:03 FANG ETF stocks
Investors QQQ down 12 %
First Trust Internet  down 15 %

1665 2018-10-30 14:35:58 Stocks have already been cycling down because you can't party hard on other people's money forever.
1666 2018-10-30 14:35:52 Most of the stocks I see with a good bounce had RSI of -30
1667 2018-10-30 14:35:50 HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! No, its not. It's been dropping for over 2 weeks now. Have you actually looked? We pulled all our stocks out, THANK GOD. We would have lost everything we've gained the last year.
1668 2018-10-30 14:35:48 Je profite de l'accalmie aujourd'hui pour faire des STOCKS ;)
1669 2018-10-30 14:35:36 $VIX has doubts about this rally so far,flat for the moment.

See if stocks or $VIX is right.
1670 2018-10-30 14:35:24 Stocks have lost all the earnings for the year because of trumps tariffs and a out of control budget deficit  due to trumps tax cut to the rich. Once again trump proves he doesn't know the truth.
1671 2018-10-30 14:35:20 “Stock Market,” “Election,” “Midterms,” and “Stocks” etc. are not proper nouns and should not be capitalized. In the small things as in the large you are “massively” incompetent.
1672 2018-10-30 14:34:45 Also, most of his base don’t own stocks and dont have savings. Just saying.

1674 2018-10-30 14:34:34 @Sarge986 What happened to defense stocks Sarge?
1675 2018-10-30 14:34:32 With you as president, no one can afford stocks.
1676 2018-10-30 14:34:06 The Coruscant Market is up massively since the Election, but is now taking a little pause - people want to see what happens with the Midterms. If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Jedi. They like the Alderaan financial model, High Taxes & Open Borders!
1677 2018-10-30 14:33:37 Stocks open higher as Wall Street tries to shake off a lousy month. Dow now up 198 points.
1678 2018-10-30 14:33:04 Trump is 100% correct on this. I voted straight Dem in 2016, and my stocks ARE down!
1679 2018-10-30 14:32:05 If my stocks wer're a rollercoaster ride they'd be really fun cause they just keep going down
1680 2018-10-30 14:31:10 What a nonsense to yell that the stocks go down when people do the best thing they can, vote Democratic 
1681 2018-10-30 14:31:05 Added $FCSC and $CLVS.  $FCSC is speculative with potential 10x return; $CLVS is mature but cheap. Overall biotech market is doing terrible and frightening, but it could be a time to get in slowly and selectively. Now I only have three bio stocks: $AXON, $FCSC, and $CLVS
1682 2018-10-30 14:31:04 yes!
1683 2018-10-30 14:30:41 Select $sns.v $slsdf finally exploded over 0.10 now at 0.11 up over 15% !!!!

Get your cheap shares! Selling is exhausted. Company based on scrap value is worth at least 0.20! They have 7.5 cents in cash 
#stocks #tsxv #pennystocks #VALUE
1684 2018-10-30 14:30:09 Yes do that...vote Democrat! Stocks will be fine...this is just you making more things up.

1687 2018-10-30 14:28:41 So far, the semiconductors stocks $SMH are strong today. This is the key to the tech stocks. It must have a strong close, we shall see.
1688 2018-10-30 14:28:36 $NFLX volume today is crazy. Almost earnings type volume, like some news is coming. Far exceeds other #FAANG stocks, just seems weird imo.
1689 2018-10-30 14:28:34 $AQUA at $10.80 Sell - Stock Market Alert sent at 10:13 AM ET to subscribers #stocks
1690 2018-10-30 14:28:19 For those of us who follow European banks, David Fingold on @marketcall yesterday talked about European bank stocks as being "a failure" due to too much competition (i.e. low barriers to entry). I can't help but think weakness may have something to do with a -0.5 interest rate.
1691 2018-10-30 14:28:14 The Stock Market is up massively since the Election, but is now taking a little pause - people want to see what happens with the Midterms. If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Resistor. They like the Markab financial model, High Taxes & Open Orbits!
1692 2018-10-30 14:28:08 I had BC/BS though a major corp. After I got sick a set period of time 6 mos it was preexisting they cobraed me.  I not only lost my insurance, b now uninsurable I lost my fully pd 4 home, savings, 401k, retirement, stocks. Just my treatment alone ran 250k a yr. 
Stop lying
1693 2018-10-30 14:27:19 @TimHockey TIM! As CEO of @TDAmeritrade and while you're out bike riding, I'd like to know what you're doing to fix the @thinkorswim  platform "lagging" issues that have been tormenting users intermittently for some time now????  #stocks #daytrade #daytrader #TOS #thinkorswim
1694 2018-10-30 14:27:13 thats what most PI's look at yes.  More sophisticated investors look further ahead and thats where research comes in. stainless growth is 6% pa and stocks depleting so I think #nickel has to go up
1695 2018-10-30 14:26:56 I lost some money on stocks due to the federal reserve interest rate hike, most of the stock market has suffered because of it. Liberals should stay far away from the stock market all together, it’s a system about logical investment and trading. Trump helped boost it.
1696 2018-10-30 14:26:35 STOCKS ARE DOWN #stopthelies
1697 2018-10-30 14:26:22 What a comeback in stocks we've already seen this morning
1698 2018-10-30 14:26:20 I started in aim properly last few months justins words on story of a company reign true. Buffett also states the same, im happy to hold stocks for years because there true potential shows over a period of time and in that time we are all tested.
1699 2018-10-30 14:26:12 Only a fool tries to predict short-term market fluctuations. Stocks are a very good long-term investment.
1700 2018-10-30 14:26:09 Buy him stocks worth R1.5k, he’ll thank you in a few years 
1701 2018-10-30 14:25:45 I don't have any stocks so guess I'm ok
1702 2018-10-30 14:25:34 Bonds slide overnight as stocks rebound during overseas trading

1703 2018-10-30 14:25:22 If the stocks stop going down, I think they will go up, believe me
1704 2018-10-30 14:25:04 RT TheBullBull "academic_dud Check the last tweet. Plenty stocks"
1705 2018-10-30 14:24:37 yield stocks and corp bonds are trading much better than before, maybe the stress is over?
1706 2018-10-30 14:24:36 It's up massively but it's now taking a little pause? This has got to be the most ignorant post I've seen in weeks!  Never had a setting president said, if you want your stocks to go down vote for the opposing party. You get dumber by the day!
1707 2018-10-30 14:23:58 U know the stocks mentioned ?
1708 2018-10-30 14:23:57 The Stock Market is up massively since the Election but is taking a little pause of 10 months or so.  If you want stocks to crash, puppies to die, the moon to explode and kittens to go extinct, I strongly suggest voting Democrat.
1709 2018-10-30 14:23:54 Stocks are going down because this is the tRump economy. Finally out from under the safety that Obama built for eight years, the GOP financial ruin begins. Happens every time.
1710 2018-10-30 14:23:47 I DGAF about stocks. I want a government that isn't trying to strip civil rights from transgender citizens
1711 2018-10-30 14:23:39 U mean the one nutjob Krugman predicted if Trump won? An unrecoverable recession & collapsing stock mkt? Meantime Trump’s dereg & tax cuts created best economy in yrs & 35% gain in stocks since elected. Hope u shorted mkt on Krugman’s prediction & ur misunderstanding of economics
1712 2018-10-30 14:23:21 Rotation out of ridiculously valued stocks definitely ongoing but inventory build is firms trying to get out in front of potential higher prices due to tariffs increasing from 10% to 25% on Chinese goods after 12/31/18.
1713 2018-10-30 14:23:19 Stocks bounce off yesterday's drop
1714 2018-10-30 14:23:17 Corrections make strong stocks very easy to spot. 
Those are often little-known companies. But funds are accumulating shrs behind the scenes.
E.g.: AUDC, REGI, NIHD, BDSI, NTWK, CDNA, MED, SCVL, AOBC, CHMA, ... ..

Keep an open mind. It's a market of stocks. Not a stock market.
1715 2018-10-30 14:22:44 No kids, don’t live with my parents makes over 50 grand a year  my stocks up.

1721 2018-10-30 14:21:48 My stocks are down and you’re in office so I suggest this is your fault.  I’m voting blue.  And stop with the fear rhetoric.  It’s childish.

1723 2018-10-30 14:21:02 You must not have a 401k or any stocks.
1724 2018-10-30 14:20:41 No joke vote blue ur bound to loose ur stocks plan simple
1725 2018-10-30 14:20:37 Ever looked at a 50 year timeline of the markets? Stocks go up and down all the time. Checked the unemployment numbers lately?
1726 2018-10-30 14:20:20 The stocks are down 20 plus percent and this is a direct result of your stupid trade war and two aggressive interest rate increases. We need to vote the GOP out to stop the free fall and bring sanity back to our country. #economy #VoteThemOut #IMPEACH
1727 2018-10-30 14:20:17 Stocks are already crashing because of you @realDonaldTrump. You finally managed to kill @BarackObama’s bull market. Sad.
1728 2018-10-30 14:20:03 But currently Republicans are in control and have been for a couple years.

So why are the stocks pausing and going down?

Something you aren't telling people?
1729 2018-10-30 14:19:50 Rip to smash 4 weeklies if we get a demo that allows for stocks and no items
1730 2018-10-30 14:19:41 It would also help if we set up a hedge fund specically to buy the Dow stocks immediately after earnings announcements. Rich dems want chaos and purposely want panic.
1731 2018-10-30 14:19:37 futures are being lead around by stocks so i'm just gonna stick with them for now.

1739 2018-10-30 14:18:39 Was it the dems when the stocks were on the rise too? Or do they just have the credit when it's negative?
1740 2018-10-30 14:18:32 I used to day trade NFLX till late 2012 & looked into e mini’s & was hooked;properly managed ES, RTY & NQ but esp ES is greatest ‘wealth creator’ ever created that 99.9% public unaware of & still look @ stocks ( recommended ROKU in Mar 2 friends) but staying e mini focused
1741 2018-10-30 14:17:29 Is that why @BarackObama is the president who brought the stocks to 20k for the 1st time ever? Yup! You lie like a rug! Ur riding the coattails of @BarackObama  ! Ur numbers are actually lower than his! The proof is obvious, vote Trumplican & your stocks will decrease! #VOTEBLUE
1742 2018-10-30 14:17:29 Currencies are an ugly contest and right now the $ is ugliest of them all. Falling bonds, falling stocks, worsening deficit at peak of the cycle, pressure on reserve managers to keep out of $ due to sanctions risk and no regard for rules based global order. EUR & EM better
1743 2018-10-30 14:17:23 Which begs the question. Can the bull market really be at an end if one of the major exchanges in options & stocks, here & in Europe, is starting to trace out a bullish pattern? And notice price is now ABOVE the 50 & 200 Day M/A's with a golden cross looking likely.    2/2
1744 2018-10-30 14:17:02 It seems like people are trading in after-hours and letting stocks tank during market hours because of higher unpredictability.

1746 2018-10-30 14:16:45 Stock Market is up massively since even before the Election, but is now plunging - people want to see what happens with the Midterms. If you want your Stocks to go down, I suggest voting #GOP. They like the Con-man financial model, Dictators, Nazi's, and failed businessmen!

1752 2018-10-30 14:15:05 HAHA so funny. Meanwhile, you have a CEO (maybe? He removed the title from the website) buying stock in the open market between a earnings release and a 10-Q... But yes, tell me about pot stocks.
1753 2018-10-30 14:14:52 So let me get this straight, you take credit if stocks go up, you don't take responsibility if stocks go down under your watch and now it'll be the democrats fault if they win the house and Senate if stocks go down! You are some piece of work! You are a Failure in leadership! 
1754 2018-10-30 14:14:47 7am forget the stocks.  I want this burger!

prior to 2016.
1756 2018-10-30 14:13:09 Stocks are diving dumpy.  Interest rates % UP.  Inflation UP.  Debt - gigantically UP.  GDP - DOWN.  You're useless.
1757 2018-10-30 14:12:36 Yuppp. I agree. Once production is up and large companies start cutting prices the little guys wont be able to break even. I messed up never buying any weed stocks during the runs because i was fearful of a correction... knew it was coming just didnt know when.. didnt wanna risk

1762 2018-10-30 14:11:02 I don't understand why there's still minimal eyes on $NXEN, but I imagine one random day it'll get the attention it deserves one day. 

I see a lot of pure garbage #stocks (dark/defunct, late on SEC filings, bloated share structure, etc.) getting lots of attention. Baffling.
1763 2018-10-30 14:10:52 Stocks are going down, dems are going to win bigly . The traitor-in- chief is setting up the blame game. #donthecon
1764 2018-10-30 14:10:40 You are the cause of so much disruption.  Pitting good people against each other.  You know your tax cut to the rich didn't work for long, so now, stocks are correcting.  The deficit is killing us and the market. YOU caused that.
1765 2018-10-30 14:10:39 No, I'm sure that's been going on, but inventory builds can mean that the idea of future sales in improving too. But you don't think FANGS were overvalued? You don't think some move out of high dividend stocks is a part of what's going on? We've had a nice move too, make a print?
1766 2018-10-30 14:10:32 My local Trader Joe’s stocks it in the frozen meat section. It would add a little soupcon of health to this monster...
1767 2018-10-30 14:10:26 With outright lack of vigilance in keeping this exchange clean of riff raff such as MDXG, no doubt other stocks and investment vehicles on this exchange have to be brought into question. With the blatant lack of actionable steps in removing a cancer, the whole exchange suffers.
1768 2018-10-30 14:10:05 POT stocks back on radar
1769 2018-10-30 14:09:32 HOW MANY DOG WHISTLES DO YOU HAVE ANYWAY?

1st of all ... the Stocks are going down because there is nothing more to prop them up!  Nothing more for CEO's to manipulate the value - they've used all the tricks... IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME AND THE REAL VALUE WILL EMERGE!
1770 2018-10-30 14:09:25 And what if you don't have stocks and want to stick it to the elite who have them? I mean, the elite are your enemies right? Oh no, the dilemma! Thank god Trump supports don't have any ideology & just cult loyalty or they might have to think for a second.

1778 2018-10-30 14:07:43 That rallying cry, often shortened to BTD, rested on a couple of other bullish ideas that merited their own shorthand: ZIRP and TINA. That is the idea that zero-interest-rate policy from central banks means “there is no alternative” to buying stocks.

1780 2018-10-30 14:07:34 The stock market is not a measuring stick for our economy. We work for our money, we don’t depend on stocks. It’s relevant to Rich people because they do depend on it to get richer off of the stuff we buy and they sell. If you don’t buy it they can’t sell it. That’s economics 101

1783 2018-10-30 14:07:02 I was just thinking how implementing (watching) these stocks has really help me gain a better "feel" of the market. Thank Stewie!
1784 2018-10-30 14:06:46 Lmao, its the people investing idiot. Buying and selling causes the stocks to go up and down.  And decisions you make like terriffs that cause us investors to back off from buting oit if fear the terriffs  will hurt our investment.
1785 2018-10-30 14:06:25 the broad mkt doing better than some stocks like $LUV. I said years ago if short term rates approach 2.5 to 3% it was going to let a lot of air out of equities. Also wonder how Citadel and Virtu's cash stash is doing.
1786 2018-10-30 14:06:14 “Buy the dip” has been an investor refrain for years. But such immediate bargain hunting has been absent during the recent slump in global stocks, suggesting a potential shift in market psychology.
1787 2018-10-30 14:06:10 Not to be confused with fish stocks.
1788 2018-10-30 14:05:45 Buy stocks low, sell for profits but you won't catch me holding
1789 2018-10-30 14:05:41 crazy volatility that is all.  tomorrow is only 2 weeks into legalization yet, stocks for most part down about 40-50% since 3 Mondays ago, go figure.  valuations were pretty crazy, as if no one knew that for many years. let see how it pans out over Qs.
1790 2018-10-30 14:05:15 This is true. US stocks hit new highs
1791 2018-10-30 14:05:02 The media are blaming the dip in stocks on the tariffs, which are hurting business, even small business like my brother's Midwest Aero Support. Customers bids have been accepted, but now my brother has to pay more for the parts because of tariffs.
1792 2018-10-30 14:04:35 Most people don't own Stocks, because for them "massive employment" means dad has one job at Walmart and another job at McDonald's

1805 2018-10-30 14:02:42 What are your views on the fishing industry gaining control of UK waters and controlling fish stocks
After all you have the largest British fishing fleet in your constituency.
Do you agree with them voting out? or do you just not think it is worth worrying about.
Your voters btw
1806 2018-10-30 14:02:29 Where is your proof about the Dems hurting stocks?  Without proof it seems like a lie, especially since the market went up under the Dems.

1819 2018-10-30 13:59:53 If you listen to Trump you will lose money.  The Fed is planning more interest rate hikes.  Other countries central banks have also backed away from quantitative easing to maintain low interest rates.   Interest rates are going up around the world which is bad for stocks.

1827 2018-10-30 13:58:58 I doubt many of your supporters have a meaningful stock profile and those that do actually understand why their stocks are down.
1828 2018-10-30 13:58:55 Just wait for those stocks to jump when they federally legalize it in the States!
Predicted for next year.
I’m guessing if they are running out it’s only because it’s a success!
1829 2018-10-30 13:58:44 Stocks grew more under Democratic leadership, so I am comfortable with them running the show again.
1830 2018-10-30 13:58:38 Everyone’s this angry when the economy’s doing well.
A recession will happen at some point. Always does. And there are some worrying signs in stocks and housing, plus the trade war and increasing global realization of political risk.
Whenever it hits, I doubt we’ll be less angry.

1836 2018-10-30 13:57:42 Oil prices have also become more correlated with stocks and other commodities as fears over slowing global growth spur investors to sell both groups. In the latest stock-market rout, technology shares have been particularly hard hit after driving markets higher earlier this year
1837 2018-10-30 13:57:30 Stocks are taking a "little pause" because of all the market uncertainty you've caused with your tariffs, which are 100% hurting your own people. Get rid of them and the market, and the lives of your people, will improve.  Wouldn't expect you to understand any of that though
1838 2018-10-30 13:57:30 One of my stocks increased by 5.1% today and I found parking in a decent amount of time, today is going to be a good day

1840 2018-10-30 13:57:25 they build on the idea and don't kill it. I also love their focus on vertical integration with their expanded fresh foods programme. They also appear to have supply chain issues with some of their products. Again, this is from my perspective as a consumer. Out of stocks at retail

1850 2018-10-30 13:55:55 My analysis has not changed much. Yes, the market and certain stocks are oversold and a technical bounce or snap-back rally could occur on any day. But downside risk and volatility risk remain very high. Until we see signs of capitulation, I'm staying 100% in cash.

1852 2018-10-30 13:55:15 While #GE remains to be an outlier to the foregoing, joining just two other companies in the #SP500 since early October to cut their #dividend, a whopping 291 companies in the S&P 500 index have increased their dividend according to data provided by #HowardSilverblatt #stocks

1854 2018-10-30 13:54:46 yep, i wouldn't be surprised if we enter a prolonged period (3-5 years) of sub-2% NOI growth.. just not sure how stocks will react. Obviously the convexity is brutal if they reprice to a 5% dividend yield, which is what you'd play for, but unclear what would make that happen

1870 2018-10-30 13:52:23 My two cents: stocks don't tend to bottom in the face of "Stocks Might Be Bottoming" headlines. 

It's possible, but doesn't seem probable.

1876 2018-10-30 13:50:33 No, when stocks are overvalued as they are today due to corporations buying their own stocks, (speculation) a big crash isn’t far off. We need to limit speculation. You keep thinking that corporations act as “reasoned actors” but in reality they’re only concern is profit.
1877 2018-10-30 13:50:29 OH Shaddup... the reason the stocks are down is your macro economic policies suck!! Every1 knows trickle down supply side economics doesnt work since the word was coined by Reagan's guy. Take a seat on a double wide. #MAGA

1892 2018-10-30 13:47:54 Wait, I think you "misspoke"...you mean that the Trump economy is starting to match the lofty highs caused previously by the Fed making up for 10 years of anti-business policies, and stocks & interests rates are heading back to a more "normal" relationship? So there's rotation?
1893 2018-10-30 13:47:45 A little pause? Look at global stocks. Ultimately US cannot be an island. You made a mistake with Gary Cohn.
1894 2018-10-30 13:47:32 kind of goes back to the warnings years ago that if short term rates ever went to 3% it would deflate these pumped up mo-mo stocks. Wonder how Virtu and Citadel are doing as far as available cash for churn?
1895 2018-10-30 13:47:32 What BS!  Even if it were true, even if my stocks would go down if Dems win vs going up if Republicans win, I would still vote against you. Are you bribing the American people? Meager financial gains for Totalitarianism?
1896 2018-10-30 13:47:27 Repeat after me: the stock market is not the economy. Do you think average Americans, hard working middle class people have money in stocks?? They barely have 500 in savings. I suggest voting blue to save democracy. Literally
1897 2018-10-30 13:47:16 Nothing right now... but when the time comes... commodity stocks... NZ$, AUD... that's the shorter range yearly, longer range the new currencies in Europe after the Eur0 breakup...
1898 2018-10-30 13:47:03 Applauding the possible economic downturn because “stocks are on sale” is not a good look for the FI community. 

When the economy slows people lose jobs, lose food, lose houses etc. 

It may not affect us, but we should care greatly how it affects others.
1899 2018-10-30 13:46:46 Stocks losing all of it’s gains this year is more that a little pause. It’s funny how when the stocks go up it is due to you but when the stocks go down it’s the Dems fault. Also, what’s with all of this Venezuela crap you keep spouting off about? Bullshit!!

1905 2018-10-30 13:46:08 I’m seeing a strange, non-red colour beside some of my weed stocks. Odd. Ah well, I’m sure it will pass.
1906 2018-10-30 13:46:00 lots of stocks out there not run by certifiable loonies
1907 2018-10-30 13:45:59 @FLNewsCenter Remember what Obama & Biden said Hillary was best person for of President! Dem's have real good plans for country or people! Republicans must take
control of house & Senate or jobs business stocks market go back to bad times like Obama years! Taxes will go up again!
1908 2018-10-30 13:45:56 @realDonaldTrump Stocks got really nailed late Monday after Bloomberg reported the U.S. is preparing new tariffs against all remaining Chinese imports.  Trump's trade war could reverse all gains and create another 2008.  #VoteBlue
1909 2018-10-30 13:45:52 Boy, this market is fun! #stocks #investing
1910 2018-10-30 13:45:33 Stocks are going down and it’s all on you.
1911 2018-10-30 13:45:18 No; #stocks collapsing are the result of a stock market long a bubble - soaring prices while incomes near-flat and many incomes nil.
1912 2018-10-30 13:45:03 Stocks open lower but quickly turn positive.
1913 2018-10-30 13:44:58 Good thing $UA can earn that .20 eps this year- good for 23% move and 100x eps- you can't give tech stocks away right now for above avg growth and 10-15x forward multiples...
1914 2018-10-30 13:44:56 Newsflash: your stocks have been going down all month under THIS PRESIDENT
1915 2018-10-30 13:44:35 I can't afford stocks so I'll vote Democrat.  Thanks for the suggestion @realDonaldTrump
1916 2018-10-30 13:44:17 Actually anyone with a 401 or stocks knows this is a complete lie. Any gains made earlier this year have been lost. But hey 
1917 2018-10-30 13:44:13 And Mueller. Don't forget about that guy! I haven't. Giuliani - my Consigliere - ran his mouth off again, and now everyone's talking about the guy. I wasn't hoping no-one would mention him again until after the mid-terms. When I answer his questions, THEN you'll see stocks tank!
1918 2018-10-30 13:43:58 I am all about generating income from my portfolio. I hold utilities, reit’s, cef’s, etf’s and some large caps( T, MO). If you like these type of stocks, wait until a Fed rate hike. The market will panic and you can pick them up at a nice discount. Price recovers quickly.
1919 2018-10-30 13:43:56 Now blaming the Fed. for the drop in the market instead of tariffs & other Trump policies. Ridiculous! The Fed. raises interest rates to curb inflation. Stocks are overinflated because of all the buybacks from the tax cuts. Trying to fool your base right before midterms,
1920 2018-10-30 13:43:43 Open your eyes @realDonaldTrump ! Stocks only as good as recent moves which is down down down because of YOUR tariffs. If no turnaround by Election Day the blue wave will swamp us all.
1921 2018-10-30 13:43:35 If the Republicans are not removed from office this downward spiral will inevitably continue. You know nothing about the stock market. But you continue to ignore the fact that many families can’t afford stocks! They’re working two jobs just to make ends meet you idiot! WAKE UP!!!
1922 2018-10-30 13:43:19 Let’s start by requiring all elected officials to sell their stake in companies or sell stocks or other connections to companies that they can influence while in Congress. Let’s hold them all accountable!
1923 2018-10-30 13:43:09 Even further confusion as to why housing stocks have been utterly decimated
1924 2018-10-30 13:43:00 STOCKS TO AVOID:

1.MYCRON
2.YKGI
3.CSCSTEL

The local cold rolled coil producers have been under pressure due to cheap imports. Besides that, the local steel market has turned bearish due to antitrade measures, soft property & construction sectors & the halting of mega projects.
1925 2018-10-30 13:42:56 Your magas don't own stocks!
1926 2018-10-30 13:42:52 On this he is right. If Democrats win control in the Mid term, the yield curve will invert and stocks will sell off. If Republicans retain control, yield curve will steepen and the stock rally continues till late 2019.

1929 2018-10-30 13:42:25 Fixed it: 
According to White House advisor Larry Kudlow, stocks are falling due to fear that Democrats will win midterms and end "pro-growth policies.” Per Wall Street sources tariffs, interest rate hikes, concerns over the deficit, normal buy-sell needs, are reasons for decline
1930 2018-10-30 13:42:05 I sell strangles in ETF's... Usually short puts in stocks I would not mind owning at that price.
1931 2018-10-30 13:41:55 Smallpox eradicated in 1980. But, you are so right... it isn't completely gone because the U.S. and Russia, maintain stocks of the virus. So, if it makes a "comeback", you know where to start the investigation.
1932 2018-10-30 13:41:53 "If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat"... how do you explain the stocks taking a dive with Republicans?
1933 2018-10-30 13:41:26 SP futures markets gave back overnight gains.  Stocks open near flat.
1934 2018-10-30 13:41:25 How many Americans own stocks? Who is he addressing here?

The market had "priced in" the idea of the Democrats winning the House for months. #bloomberg #wsj #article …

1950 2018-10-30 13:38:28 A little home truth for @realDonaldTrump:- no one has EVER succeeded in controlling the financial markets and the more he tries to the more the markets will tank. On this subject Donald would be wise to just zip it! #stocks

1953 2018-10-30 13:37:58 I don’t care for the dems but the mass accumulation of stocks at a cheap price over a long period is best.
Any other approach is ignorant.
1954 2018-10-30 13:37:52 Stock market rallied cause u gave tax break to companies so they used that money to buy their own stocks and therefor rally on wall st, how hard is that to understand???

1961 2018-10-30 13:36:15 Your 401k is down today b/c POTUS is intentionally sabotaging the market, claiming stocks will be harmed by expected Dem win next week with zero evidence.

1966 2018-10-30 13:35:31 Most people voting for you or people like you live in rural America, where stocks mean dick unless you’re referring to a stock tank.
1967 2018-10-30 13:35:29 Most of your deplorables don't own stocks.
1968 2018-10-30 13:35:21 US Trilemma holding.  US can have only 2 of 3 of rising rates/USD/stocks.  Problem is US econ is 65% consumption, & cap gains alone are ~150% of annual US consumption growth.  That doesn't include IRA's (another 50% of consumption) or stock options (big % too.)
1969 2018-10-30 13:35:20 similar thing happening to many other stocks.  $AMZN not much different...

1988 2018-10-30 13:30:44 I highkey wanna take my money out of Acorns since the stock market is about to go to shit but idk.... I barely know anything about stocks 
1989 2018-10-30 13:30:19 Best off waiting until stocks have reset from the next crash unless dividends is what you're after.
1990 2018-10-30 13:30:11 Well @CNN “stocks dropped over tariff concerns” ... they say it and Insinuate Trump is to blame. There is no proof tariffs had anything to do with it. It’s a guess. It’s OPINION, whoch is not #msm job. That’s why they they are deemed #EnemyOfState @MSNBC @washingtonpost @nytimes

1992 2018-10-30 13:28:59 Stocks are nosediving.  Our deficit is skyrocketing.  Trump and GOP gave $1.5 trillion taxpayer dollars to the richest 1% and now the country is getting screwed hard! Vote democrat in November to put Trump's madness in check! #BlueWave2018 #VoteDemocrat

1996 2018-10-30 13:28:05 Of particular interest are bank stocks down 15% on average on year- they should be way up with your tax cuts, business investments, low unemployment and supercharged economy- it is not a good sign that they are lagging the way they are. How bout some explanation on that.
1997 2018-10-30 13:27:55 I see stocks bounce up on 5 minutes chart are:

1998 2018-10-30 13:27:53 The stocks are not taking a “pause” for the  midterms. That is a ridiculous statement. Stop lying.
1999 2018-10-30 13:27:52 No need to wait until elections.  We can watch our stocks nose-diving right now under Trump! The stock market has lost all gains of the last calendar year! #ImpeachTrump #LockHimUp #MuellerTime
2000 2018-10-30 13:27:19 pero atleast nasave na natin yung 2 out 6 stocks ng book hahaha
2001 2018-10-30 13:27:16 They did a good job on that. I have always know this. There was a time the government did not borrow for a year but our debt stocks increase in naira competent due to depreciation of the naira . But children of recession will not understand this.
2002 2018-10-30 13:27:08 "Your stocks" he says to the Millennial voters, and they laughed and laughed and boiled their pasta for the 7th day in a row.
2003 2018-10-30 13:26:30 Stocks even lol
2004 2018-10-30 13:26:17 Agree that oil is rolling over.The 3 yr bear market rally in oil from $26 is over & another leg to lower lows just beginning.Could see $10 oil in 2nd half of 2019 as  global bust next year hits demand hard.Would avoid energy stocks here as they likely underperform in coming rally
2005 2018-10-30 13:25:42 You are getting more sad.  Markets are taking a breather since it has had such a run up since March 2009 after your country had a financial calamity.  Up to now 2018 gains no more. As for 2017 gains, not as massive as you put it. Btw, the run up in stocks for Obama massive palesU
2006 2018-10-30 13:25:25 Nothing changed since the 2000 burst -> except that bonds returned 226% and stocks returned 158% despite 2  bears markets !!
2007 2018-10-30 13:25:20 Uhhh did you not get the memo Donnie?  Stocks are down, they actually lost all the years gains, thanks to your tariffs!
2008 2018-10-30 13:24:46 What were you doing in the defence ministry? 
Counting stocks?
2009 2018-10-30 13:24:45 What a joke. When stocks go up, it's because of you. When they go down, it's because voters are nervous. Maybe your plans aren't working.
2010 2018-10-30 13:24:44 What?  Something for the Rich to think about cause the middle class sure can't afford stocks. Shove your numbers where the sun don't shine. BTW YOU LOOK DESPERATE THESE DAYS.
2011 2018-10-30 13:24:36 Most of us know what is happening sir. Some of the richest dems/lefties in the country are doing mass sell-offs of stocks to stall the market before midterms in an effort to show volatility under your presidency and Republican control. It's not going to work. #KeepTexasRed
2012 2018-10-30 13:24:22 Stocks are down due to your incompetence. If you’re still president  after midterms (which you will be) NOTHING will change in terms of stocks or Stock Market since we will still have INCOMPETENT president.
2013 2018-10-30 13:24:11 It's tanking, big difference. People are not taking a pause, they are taking whatever gains they can get because they are scared of what you are doing. We had a Democrat in office for 8 years. Stocks did not go down.
2014 2018-10-30 13:23:57 The stock market rose extremely much under Obama.  It continued to rise during the beginning of the trump presidency, while USA was still running on Obama budgets.  Now we are starting to see the effect of the trump trade war, the trump stupidity and so on, and stocks go down.
2015 2018-10-30 13:23:54 Up massively? Come on trump, everyone is feeling the plummet. You railed on about how you were responsible for the rise in stocks how about now?
2016 2018-10-30 13:23:49 Where will you be listing current shareholder stocks? $igc
2017 2018-10-30 13:23:25 It was already on the rise with the economy, when you took office, so do not take all the credit, all your worry about now, is how you will not loose money on your stocks. Not everyone can afford to purchase stocks.  You take credit when up, but not when down, blame someone else.
2018 2018-10-30 13:22:52 Stocks struggle after trade worries send yuan to 10-year low
2019 2018-10-30 13:22:47 The August Case-Shiller Home Price Index was 0.0% m/m,  well below the +0.4% consensus and +0.3% July gain.  This is a moving average figure, so it is lagging.   Weak home prices, along with the drop in stocks, are taking a toll on household assets -- bad for consumption outlook.
2020 2018-10-30 13:22:47 @APompliano check this out: my brother is sending me stocks from US to Europe. After waiting for 2 weeks, my bank replied, that this can take up to 6 weeks, as several parties are involved... I love it!
2021 2018-10-30 13:22:42 I w'd think most opinions are based on some perception of facts, that's where opinions begin. CLEARLY obvious why stocks have been shaken, not rocket science here! I don't disagree.  Leave the politics to the other shows, really not interested financial shows political views. 
2022 2018-10-30 13:22:30 What the hell are you talking about Kate. I’m his supporter. I owe stocks. And know exactly what he’s talking about.

The average Dem thinks Trump supporters are stupid. They still don’t get it. You’re still as terribly disenfranchised as you were in Nov ‘16. Watch this Nov...lol
2023 2018-10-30 13:22:12 Even better:  Remember when Yellen testified that she wouldn't rule out adding equities to the FED's balance sheet?  NOW'S the time!  $FANG or should we let @realDonaldTrump pick which stocks the U.S. taxpayer should own?
2024 2018-10-30 13:22:09 WHATEVER HAPPEN TO BUMP STOCKS?!?!??!
2025 2018-10-30 13:22:02 Trump is such a kid. He has no clue as to the movements of stocks, no clue why Venezuela is like it is. Trump is at the moment taxing Americans heavely with his import duties, that is high taxes. So sad.

2028 2018-10-30 13:21:53 Our stocks are down for the year... are you lucid today?
2029 2018-10-30 13:21:51 I’m confused, isn’t all 3 branches currently controlled by the Republican Party? Aren’t stocks currently waaaaaaay down? 
2030 2018-10-30 13:21:21 We need to ban Trump’s use of bump stocks on his lies.

2032 2018-10-30 13:21:15 I Want my Stocks to go back UP.  (EINSTEIN’s definition of Insanity)
2033 2018-10-30 13:21:06 IT stocks rose. Infosys (up 2.48%), TCS (up 1.37%) and Tech Mahindra (up 2.91%) edged higher. Wipro fell 0.11%.
2034 2018-10-30 13:21:06 Not sure about that whole list but @riddler_smitb is the most clueless investor I have come across. He claims to have knowledge of 100's of AIM stocks but not one is in profit . As for @michelle_crypto well she's thick as two thieves and I don't think people taker seriously.
2035 2018-10-30 13:21:02 Seems like tech stocks are all searching for stable point.. $AMZN $FB $TWTR $GOOG and the others
2036 2018-10-30 13:20:45 Stocks?  What Effin stoCks. 90% of Americans DON'T have stocks or 401k's you idiot. Who cares about how much money you and your buddies made on the tax cut.  You get to buy MORE stocks so the rich get richer and the poorer STAY POOR.  SCHYSTER.
2037 2018-10-30 13:20:39 Stocks see most volatile October in a decade, but 2018 still set to be a normal year: analyst
2038 2018-10-30 13:20:30 Oil sector stocks declined. Among public sector oil marketing companies,  HPCL (down 4.07%) and Indian Oil Corporation (down 3.33%), edged lower.

It will cover bnf automatically

So no need 2 jump n find stocks
2040 2018-10-30 13:20:15 Loads of people speculating about a bear market, an incoming recession, interest rates hikes... If the stocks you own are solid and you expect great returns from them in the long run... then all of this is just noise. Stick to your plan. Buy cheap stocks. Forget about the rest.
2041 2018-10-30 13:20:07 Lol, well I haven’t been playing SQ recently was just looking at this chart. There are much better stocks for options, even so been mainly scalping SPX puts
2042 2018-10-30 13:19:46 No data on this, but 80% of stocks are owned by institutions, including funds.
2043 2018-10-30 13:19:32 I don't care about stocks.  Most people are too poor to own any.  Your stock market boom has little direct effect on us.  Your spewing of hatred, your lies, your cheating and your support of White Nationalism, however, does impact us.
2044 2018-10-30 13:19:27 Which FTSE stocks did you buy?
2045 2018-10-30 13:19:26 Overall market sentiment remained weak largely in sync with other Asian  markets, tracking overnight losses at the Wall Street as caution grew  ahead of a slew of earnings reports this week. Gains in IT stocks limited losses for the market.
2046 2018-10-30 13:19:14 Stock market futures are down today due to FANGMAN stocks getting smoked in pre-market trade. I still believe the Big Money managers will try to move the markets higher ("Window Dressing"). Long or Short stay tuned.

NFLX: 99.1X earnings, 24.8X book, 8.3X sales
AMZN: 95.3X earnings, 19.2X book, 3.4X sales

Vs. SPX approx: 18.5X earnings, 3X book, 2X sales

So "cheap" then? 
2049 2018-10-30 13:18:10 Incoming Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the leftist who calmed investors with his initially market-friendly approach, ditched a $13 billion airport project backed by some of the nation’s wealthiest businessmen, sparking a rout in stocks, bonds and currency.

Now Trump with the tax cuts, deficit booming upward and losing to China on the tariffs its becoming clear that it's time for foreign investors to run.
2053 2018-10-30 13:17:12 The Quebec Oil Gas Association meeting was very upbeat last night! All the gas companies plan to meet with the new energy minister within a couple weeks! They reiterated that CAQ is pro oil gas development! Big things coming!

2054 2018-10-30 13:16:44 Mr President, respectfully            1) Democrats aren’t the enemy. 2) Stocks have already lost all 2018 gains. 3) The Venezuelan model began with a man who threw out their Constitution and became a dictator. Dems are no where near this.
2055 2018-10-30 13:16:27 How many people do you think own stocks? LOL.

2063 2018-10-30 13:14:07 Had two trades $GE for .50 to 1.00 profit, would have to look up exact numbers but left the carcass for others, I don't like trading headline stocks for most part.
2064 2018-10-30 13:13:45 That's what happens when companies get a freebie pass on taxes stocks go up for a short time. Have you seen the food price increases? Diet soda 12pack selling for almost 6 dollars, bread is 2.99to5.99 milk has increased by about 25 cent per gallon. Electric now 80$more per month
2065 2018-10-30 13:13:32 @realDonaldTrump FYI, the stocks have been falling and the republicans are in power.
2066 2018-10-30 13:13:28 There is no conspiracy by the Fed to destroy Trump’s scoreboard. The Fed acknowledged on average during a recession they cut 500 basis points. They want to hike as much as possible (if stocks allow it) to avoid QE4 next time.
2067 2018-10-30 13:12:54 If the market smells a Recession coming, these stocks can fall so far it will take your breath away....

You can thank the Fed too, if it comes to pass.
2068 2018-10-30 13:12:51 US consumption & therefore tax receipts are critically-dependent on asset price appreciation.  As soon as QT blows up stocks/assets, US economy will begin to soften as will US tax receipts, driving deficit higher.

2070 2018-10-30 13:12:25 I haven't seen these tax cuts help me yet.  Pay is the same, stocks worse than the start of the year.  All I see is you screwing me day after day.

I'm voting this afternoon and assure you there will not be a single red vote on my ballot.
2071 2018-10-30 13:12:15 Neither you nor @jimcramer know with any certainty why stocks are doing what hey are doing in this small window.  Just guessing.  And I think you both know that

2073 2018-10-30 13:12:06 If you want your stocks to be worthless, vote GOP. Because they are picking your pocket while you’re distracted. They are stealing your money, your clean air, your freedom, your honor.
2074 2018-10-30 13:12:02 Thanks! 
2075 2018-10-30 13:11:50 BREAKING:  Trump: "If You Want Stocks To Fall, Vote Democrat"
2076 2018-10-30 13:11:50 Stocks have gone nowhere since your fed chair took over, or you tax cuts went into effect, or your first budget started. They were way up until the end of Obama's last budget however.
2077 2018-10-30 13:11:49 sure the pot stocks are down but $NFLX has me down about $5k and for no good reason
2078 2018-10-30 13:11:45 Simplest way is monitor only n only 10 stocks for your life more then enough as a trader for life.. no need to jump for every stock
2079 2018-10-30 13:11:44 If you don't have enough money to invest in stocks I strongly suggest you vote Democrat.

Because Republicans only want to make the rich richer

“Global markets more poised for growth than US stocks”

- “D.C. chaos catching up with stocks”

- “We don’t have faith in meaningful tax cuts”
2086 2018-10-30 13:10:02 Do you realize how much stocks have gone down in just this past week? And how much they've gone down this month?

If you truly want the economy to do well, don't vote GOP. They're the ones who constantly have crippled it. Only the Dems have led to improvements in past 40 years
2087 2018-10-30 13:09:46 i for one am shocked that stocks are flaming hot pile of dog shit everytime the market opens
2088 2018-10-30 13:09:38 For decades we have had this need to assign credit and blame for every wiggle in the market. Stocks are a discounting mechanism. They typically forecast activity 6-9 months down the road but sometimes get caught up in today, especially bull market corrections.
2089 2018-10-30 13:09:27 Strange, during the Obama’s administration the S&P increased 6600%. What makes you believe that stocks market will decrease if Democrats are elected? Please present facts, not opinions.
2090 2018-10-30 13:09:17 If this is correct, I'll have to add BH-controlled companies to my boycott list. Too bad. Buffett can pick stocks. Would that he chose his friends as wisely.

Hoping sentiment collapses this week to add, but not good.

2103 2018-10-30 13:05:29 I don’t disagree. But the straight line these stocks have been taking both up and now down is just incredible to witness
2104 2018-10-30 13:05:29 If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Republican.

They're trying supply-side economics (tax cuts for corps & the rich) again. It always fails & hurts our economy.

It failed under Reagan, GW Bush & in LA, KS, & WI. Now it's failing under Trump.

#VoteBlue
2105 2018-10-30 13:05:23 The Stocks will continue to go down while you are President. The corporations have already cashed in the tax cut. Nothing more to gain, only to lose with industry stuck with steel tariffs.
2106 2018-10-30 13:05:09 Stocks are the indicator of the rich getting richer. Nothing more. Vote blue or your rights may be the one thing that matters that will be going down... the drain.
2107 2018-10-30 13:05:00 Stocks going downhill....the annual sale for blue chips is on...buy the leaders in their sectors, hold for the next 3 yrs, u can't go wrong.

2111 2018-10-30 13:03:59 Btw the last few weeks completely wiped off any gains in the stocks for 2018.. it's almost like 2018 didn't happen.. Too much uncertainty. Too much debt. You are going to send the US to a debt it will never recover from. You are not fiscally responsible. Change needed #VoteBlue
2112 2018-10-30 13:03:53 Your stocks did well because at 0.0% interest the ONLY place 2 put $ was in stock. The 1% is a MYTH! Say I make $10 million. I got a 1.5% tax cut, or $150K. I pay 8% st inc tax of $800K and prop tax of $200K. I can only deduct $24K for SALT now. So I’m actually paying $626K MORE!

2114 2018-10-30 13:03:41 It is NOT. One day last week we LOST all the gains made in the last year. Yes, it regained most of the ground, but dipped 250 yesterday.

Okay then.
2141 2018-10-30 13:00:41 The only thing you know about stocks is to pump and dump your casino stock leaving the stockholders with nothing while you made a fortune. You are just #donthecon. And take immense pleasure at others suffering

2143 2018-10-30 12:59:39 My stocks were doing very well UNDER OBAMA. All you've done is MASSIVELY increase the debt to give 1% tax break while destroying OUR retirement  accounts & tariffs=taxes. Next you'll cut our SSI, Medicare & preexisting conditions protections. I CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO VOTE DEMOCRAT.
2144 2018-10-30 12:59:28 The wealthiest 10% of Americans own 84% of all stocks.

2154 2018-10-30 12:58:04 The stocks will go down because they are overly inflated due to speculation.  It will happen after November but it will be all due to your retarded short sighted economic “policies”.
2155 2018-10-30 12:58:03 Thinking of becoming one of those people who refers to companies by their stock ticker designation thingy, even in idle conversation with folks who know nothing about that specialized bazaar place where traders heckle over stocks.
2156 2018-10-30 12:57:55 president should be shown some stocks that loss 50%,even 25%  it means thousands in losses+ America  always needed good oil prices. Stocks are down to lowest some in 5 years.Was OK slow down oil rise but  inflation of crude oil is necessary.CARNAGE/BUTCHERY.Market= economy health
2157 2018-10-30 12:57:36 Stocks are not a good indicator for the economy.
2158 2018-10-30 12:57:13 Stocks are dropping with Trump in charge. Didn’t happen with Obama.
2159 2018-10-30 12:56:57 Ah yes just another day and just more lies from you.  So Obama, a Democrat, triples the stock market and you claim Democrats want stocks to tank.  Oh, the last time they tanked was under a Republican. Imagine that.
2160 2018-10-30 12:56:55 Dear Kundan, we are sorry that this happened to you. Today was a huge sale day for us and hence our app faced a huge traffic and the stocks got sold out. Anyway, the gift won lasts for 24 hours, you can come back tomorrow to claim the gift won! :)
2161 2018-10-30 12:56:42 Assuming that is a real tweet... Funny how he said he was buying stocks, but then in his disclosure he acted like he owned very few stocks.
2162 2018-10-30 12:56:23 You’re president right now, & imposed tariffs on our trade partners, given away billions in tax breaks to your friends, now your lame policies are failing and stocks have plummeted, the majority of Americans CAN’T AFFORD stocks, many live check to check, you’re out of touch......
2163 2018-10-30 12:56:22 I made much more money in the market when Obama was President. A little break my ass. Over 80% S&P stocks are down more than 20%. October was one of the worst months on record. This is only the beginning with you at the helm.
2164 2018-10-30 12:56:02 Stocks are going down because of your tariffs
2165 2018-10-30 12:55:56 Professional LIAR.  Stocks are down on the Trump Trade War because Donnie threatened to raise tariffs in Nov.  “Today’s sell-off is a direct result of exacerbation if trade tensions.”  Kristina Hooper, global markets strategist at Invesco.
2166 2018-10-30 12:55:44 Uranium prices up 30% this year. Any suggestion what stocks are good here under $5?
2167 2018-10-30 12:55:38 Buyers Aren’t the usual suspects. That’s what most surprising. Not surprised WRD sold but agree on the sale price being low. Especially in stock deals with sub $5 stocks.
2168 2018-10-30 12:55:34 But stocks are dropping with YOU in charge. I don’t get it. This didn’t happen with Obama.
2169 2018-10-30 12:55:29 stocks up because of you, down because of dems, up you, down dems. Fantastic analysis, maybe nobel prize?
2170 2018-10-30 12:55:27 I haven't even voted and I have lost any gain over the past year.  So maybe it's the republicans increasing the national debt and inflation by giving tax breaks to the rich is  what lowers my stocks.
2171 2018-10-30 12:55:26  some stocks are worth buying now.
2172 2018-10-30 12:55:24 The time to buy stocks is consistently over time. You should never buy your investments with the idea, 'I have to get a certain return.' You should look at the best return possible and learn to live with that.
2173 2018-10-30 12:55:15 looks cool but you can see that the stocks are kinda low-res
2174 2018-10-30 12:55:09 ''The Stock Market is up massively since the Election, but is now taking a little pause - people want to see what happens with the Midterms. If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat...''
   guess who said it..
2175 2018-10-30 12:55:05 Wrong.  Fed wants to raise rates.  Borrowed money is what is used to pump up the market.  When the interest rates go up its more expensive to borrow that money and buy stocks with it. That's why its going down. Trumps pointing that out.  As an investor, rate increase = sell.
2176 2018-10-30 12:54:36 Stocks are down due to the Trade War youve started! Only gonna get worse!
2177 2018-10-30 12:54:11 Stocks have always gone up under Democrats and down under Republicans. Vote Democratic
2178 2018-10-30 12:53:58 The problem is that earnings are about a penny now in total!)) Emerson Electric and GE days are over. Stocks need higher multiples on FCF so they can implode faster.
2179 2018-10-30 12:53:58 What a idiot! How many people own stocks??
2180 2018-10-30 12:53:51 Great stocks sometimes get carried down to bargain levels in a broad market correction.  Current example is $CTSH.
2181 2018-10-30 12:53:43 GM all I see stocks hit bottom on 5 minutes chart are:
$AAPL
$BABA
$BIDU
$BA
$GOOGL
$SPY near
$NFLX near
$NVDA maybe
2182 2018-10-30 12:53:05 Stock market is down  cayse of your policies. You are against a global economy, due to ur tariffs on China and other countries , rising  interest rates force people to sell their stocks to catch up with their payments and pay their mortgages, credit card payments,loans etc.!!
2183 2018-10-30 12:53:03 yeah, i admit that a lot of crypto traders catch top perfectly and some guys that pretend loke pro traders usa stocks for more than 10 years tell buy the dip

2185 2018-10-30 12:52:46 The Stock Market Election, Midterms. If Stocks, I Democrat. They Venezuela, High Taxes Open Borders!
2186 2018-10-30 12:52:41 Trump, you are pathetic. The POTUS is supposed to lead ALL the citizens of our great country. This is yet another example of the seeds of division you so enjoy sewing.  As for stocks, we crashed under GW Bush and flourished under Obama. So much for another of your lies.
2187 2018-10-30 12:52:34 There's an analogy here to highly leveraged trading I keep seeing. These folks are practiced at mixing small power and large risk to manage resources far beyond their ownership. Having done it in stocks, being used to the idea (and adrenaline high?) they now apply it to politics.
2188 2018-10-30 12:52:18 Image result for the stock market is tanking
Tech stocks (and the stock market) are tanking thanks to rising interest rates. Tech stocks tanked today amid a broader stock market slide as nervous investors worried that the 10-year bull run in public stocks may be coming to an end.
2189 2018-10-30 12:52:16 Invest your $cash on sidelines now, 401k etc #stocks will soar after #RedWave2018 #Midterms2018 to finish out 4th Quarter 2018! 
2190 2018-10-30 12:52:10 You don't get it, do you. Keep pushing those lies. How are stocks helping common folk?
2191 2018-10-30 12:52:06 Stocks are down because Of China and your trade war.  If you want your hard earned money from SS and Medicare stolen from you then vote republican.  In other words if your not the 1% then you better vote DEMOCRAT.
2192 2018-10-30 12:51:39 But the question is why do we need auto katics that hold more that 15 rounds? Why aren't bump stocks illegal yet? Gun control might not work, but it sure can make it a little safer.
2193 2018-10-30 12:51:34 Tell this idiot he has nothing to do with it. Stocks are likely to sell off no matter who wins. He is looking for a scape goat for his lousy tariff policies.
2194 2018-10-30 12:51:26 I should have warned everyone a few weeks ago when I bought some Amazon stock...
It's usually a good investment strategy to short stocks in my portfolio.
2195 2018-10-30 12:51:20 Not worried , October is traditionally a bad month for stocks.  Riding the Trump train. Stay on board and stay calm.
2196 2018-10-30 12:51:18 I am just confused when supposed Veterans of the market start criticising even a tad bit movement of stocks in directions they didn’t anticipate. Blaming GOI & RBI.

Wasn’t it meant to be hard? Ego is the Enemy? @contrarianEPS
2197 2018-10-30 12:51:05 How could a president possibly say that.  Stocks have had the worst month in years under trump.  Stop with the tariffs and criticizing the fed
2198 2018-10-30 12:51:02 If it means cleaning out your bullshit, I'm very willing to take that chance. Plus, how much of your "uneducated" supporter base actually own stocks?
2199 2018-10-30 12:50:48 Until this moment I didn’t want my stocks to go down.  But I do now — because a Blue Congress would hold you to account. I’d totally pay to see that happen, and to see your sycophants in Congress lose. Then, of course, a huge rebound. Putin would lose influence. Allies reassured
2200 2018-10-30 12:50:44 We’ve watched our stocks DIVE for a year bc of YOUR tariffs and GOP policies. VOTE DEM!  It’s our only hope of sanity and stability! #BlueWave
2201 2018-10-30 12:50:30 Trevor is a were-hyena who trades stocks for a living.
2202 2018-10-30 12:50:26 The ‘forgotten men and women’ you claim to rep don’t own stocks you fool. The top 10% own 85% of the market. So you’re cheering for the super rich to become the ultra rich. #ClownKing #BetterPayingJobsNotMobs #ComradeTrump #DonTheCon
2203 2018-10-30 12:50:22 @realDonaldTrump if you can sort a trade deal for the UK that would be great. Don’t forget the forex market, stocks are fine, but we forex traders need a deal too. Whilst I am on a role here - What are the NFP jobs numbers looking like this week? #makeforexgreatagain
2204 2018-10-30 12:50:19 What are you talking about GRANDPA!!  The stock markets are down for the year.  Have you even looked at the numbers?  WTF!!  If you want the stocks to raise vote democrat!! Republicans are making fall like a rock!!    @Alyssa_Milano @EdKrassen @TitusNation @jaketapper @Acosta
2205 2018-10-30 12:50:06 Most of us don't own stocks. My groceries increased 17% in the last 3 months. Can't afford healthcare because insurance price gouges. Income not increasing. Middle Class shrinking. That is what I care about. Screw the rich and their stocks.
2206 2018-10-30 12:49:55 But... stocks went up massively under the previous President... a Democrat.

Just stating easily confirmed facts.
2207 2018-10-30 12:49:46 What about the millions upon millions of American citizens who can not afford milk let alone own fuckin stocks? Who do we vote for??
2208 2018-10-30 12:49:45 LOL #Dotard @realDonaldTrump is worse than G.W. Bush... Obama saved our stocks.
2209 2018-10-30 12:49:39 Stocks are down for the year!!!! Bring back Bernake.
2210 2018-10-30 12:49:31 As my friend @jimcramer has been saying repeatedly, stocks have been falling mostly because of The Tariffs and fears of The Fed.  The market had "priced in" the idea of the Democrats winning the House for months.
2211 2018-10-30 12:49:08 In traditional equities 15/20 stocks is considered a diversified portfolio .In crypto u should have at least 50/70 bets to consider a portfolio sufficiently diversified in the crypto world.The industry is young &the tech is new,most tokens will die-a handful will 10000x!

2213 2018-10-30 12:48:56 OK, imagine your standard wall street stock broker type.

Now imagine that this stockbroker thinks of stocks the same way the most fanatical sports fan thinks of their team. Like absolutely obsessed and simultaneously deluded about it. 

They want to give their team money.
2214 2018-10-30 12:48:46 what are you using an Abacus to count the numbers? lol

STOCKS DO NOT FOLLOW U.S. POLITICS. DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS RHETORIC!

but they do follow international politics and tensions. look at the reports the last 9 months next to international news & oil futures. You will learn

2216 2018-10-30 12:48:36 Old me - now is the time to grab a bargain! 

Me now - perhaps this has more to go. What is the general market doing? What does a short look like vs a long? Where is long term support/resistance? What are other stocks doing in sector? What are the leaders doing? Any catalysts?

2218 2018-10-30 12:48:06 Scare tactics much? The majority of your base don't own stocks. You are heading to Pittsburg today. Can't you give this mess a rest, at least for today to pretend that you care about someone else besides yourself for once, Mr Trump.
2219 2018-10-30 12:48:04 I work in stocks. It’s down bc of your tariffs, consumer fear, and swelling deficit. I can’t believe you’re insisting on going to Pittsburgh today. They do not want you there. Go golf.
2220 2018-10-30 12:47:55 Corporations are doing stock buy backs. That artificially inflates stock prices, making it look like the stocks are doing better than they are. Many people are working 2 jobd to pay bills. You may be doing well in porn. A lot of people ar struggling.
2221 2018-10-30 12:47:54 But the person could only kill one person with those weapons..mijo one wants to take away the right to own a gun for safety..just adult rifles and bump stocks bcz they kill multiple people asst a time and were designed for a war situation..not home safety
2222 2018-10-30 12:47:46 Really? I thought the stocks were already down...
2223 2018-10-30 12:47:32 So you blame already the democrats when they should win in the midterms? Your stupid trade war with the entire World is taking into account and stocks follow the Money. Soon it’s called „The isolated States of America“ They will go more dive when you screw the economy more!
2224 2018-10-30 12:47:18 Stocks DOWN for 2018 You huffing hyena!
2225 2018-10-30 12:47:18 Stocks are down because you are destroying the US economy just like you bankrupted most of your businesses
2226 2018-10-30 12:47:12 Most of us don't own stocks and the market doesn't affect our lives.
2227 2018-10-30 12:47:10 The Stock Market lost all gains earned in 2018, but is now tanking even more - people want to see what happens with the Midterms. If you want your Stocks to go up again, I strongly suggest voting Democrat. They like Americans to prosper without giving it all to rich people!
2228 2018-10-30 12:47:09 FIIs selling the strong fundamental stocks at same time.
2229 2018-10-30 12:46:56 Stocks are going down because of you. You started that trade war which has just hurt Americans but yeah just feed your ego.
2230 2018-10-30 12:46:32 Nice try. My stocks took a huge hit during the George W. Bush years, then they went way up when Obama was President. Thanks Obama and the Democrats.

2234 2018-10-30 12:45:25 It may be down for the year, but watch it soar. I hope you sold your stocks. Merry Christmas!
2235 2018-10-30 12:45:21 Liar- stocks are down because of your inadequate and actually damaging policies from your tax cuts swelling our deficits to your tariffs destroying the lively hood of our people. Yes our people- all of the people who live, work, and pray in this country #LiarInChief
2236 2018-10-30 12:45:18 Well, since I (and millions of other Americans) don't have enough income to own any stocks - or even care about the stock market, I WILL vote Democrat to help insure the federal government works for everyone! Full disclosure:  I was going to vote Democrat anyway.

2248 2018-10-30 12:43:34 My stocks soared during the Obama years. But please, go one pondering to the chucklefucks.
2249 2018-10-30 12:43:28 If you want your stocks to go up, eliminate this stupid tariffs war.  If you want them to go down, keep them in place and add even more.
2250 2018-10-30 12:43:20 Stop with the lies. You know very well that is absolute bullshit. In all actuality, this is just a normal pattern for stocks. As a matter of fact, we are headed toward another recession. But of course you don’t mention any of that

2263 2018-10-30 12:41:35 My stocks were doing very well UNDER OBAMA. All you've done is MASSIVELY increase the debt to give 1% tax break while destroying OUR retirement  accounts & tariffs=taxes. Next you'll cut our SSI, Medicare & preexisting conditions protections. I CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO VOTE DEMOCRAT.

2270 2018-10-30 12:41:07 Yep, that’s what I did — sell my long-held stocks just a couple of weeks before midterms to “see what happens.” That’s exactly how this works.
2271 2018-10-30 12:41:01 that advise of go into cash is utter bullshit, there is only observation where both bonds ($VUSTX) stocks($VQNPX) returned less than 1% over 12 months period , since 1986 , nov 1993 - 1994 , if you are so sure of negative returns for stocks for next 12 months , go into bonds !!

2400 2018-10-30 12:33:31 Yesterday, Credit Suisse's Golub said, "If the Fed DOESN'T hike in December, sell stocks."
2401 2018-10-30 12:32:34 Easy to complain now when stocks are down. Investors and analysts were clamoring for buybacks on the way up. Porges and the sell-side get paid a bit on buyback trade volume. Sell side doesn't get paid on special dividends, which is why he wasn't chirping about that until now.
2402 2018-10-30 12:31:39 Stocks don’t look good. Risk of low return or deficit too probable.

2411 2018-10-30 12:24:26 @Fibonutty In the short term yes, longer term U3O8 price determines everything. Value is value and S&P 500 will have no bearing on the price of U3O8 stocks so when S&P is depressed you alleviate his pain by buying from him and you both celebrate your wins :D

2414 2018-10-30 12:23:23 These half wits are so used to massive numbers with the tax cuts that they now destroy stocks when numbers come in as very good instead of mind blowing. It's the immediate gratification generation.

2437 2018-10-30 12:09:51 Watching @CNBC yesterday.  One expert says I must own growth stocks citing great reasons.  10 seconds later another expert says to stay away and focus on value.

Entertaining but zero actionable items or investor value.  And zero accountability.

2438 2018-10-30 12:08:50 Look at the bright side. Stocks are on sale. While they are down can be a good time to be investing. I got a T-shirt at the last conference that says Stay Calm and Invest On!
2439 2018-10-30 12:08:43 Did the FAANGs "take down the market?"

Au contraire. Being the market leaders and having the most fervent believers, they held up the longest. Most stocks were already on the mat, some sectors since 2017.

2488 2018-10-30 11:33:03 I had that exact situation with someone a few weeks back.  They could not get their head around ordering in stocks and that they could and would run or of ammo if they didn't .

2489 2018-10-30 11:32:54 to whether the stock averages fall back after election all depends on the 10% (the elite who control the stock averages.)

2570 2018-10-30 10:28:00 Good point Vincent. I suppose a mix of short and long term investments helps to mitigate cyclic risks to some degree. So far, most advice I've read suggests I pull out of stocks soon as the outlook is uncertain. But I'm willing to take a chance.

2589 2018-10-30 10:15:14 How much people are spending and purchasing.  The economy id decreasing because people are buying less because they have less money and nore debt.  When the stocks are good that means people are buying more and have less debt.   Thats it in a nutshell!
2590 2018-10-30 10:15:10 In all honesty though, a lot of the shit that large tech is doing is anything but sustainable without some kind of special influence.

Their stocks are dropping, they're thinking of ousting their CEOs, they're getting less users, etc etc.

This is for the fuggin midterms.

With stocks it doesn't ensure that 4 years or 10 the prices would,trble  double or single !! 
So the fears of mind behave differently!

Was hoping for a ‘please don’t go email’ instead it basically said ‘go on then fuck off’ lol not sure why I was expecting that but I’m a little hurt 
2617 2018-10-30 09:59:19 Just finished the first draft of a 500 word article I have due tomorrow, and I’m at 2302 words. That’s right! Who needs words? I’m over stocked so I’m going word crazy. I’ve got words for 8c, 10c and even $19.99! Come on down and get the words YOU need while stocks last! #Sale
2618 2018-10-30 09:58:30 But other than the few careless, uniformed investors, stocks are the safest productive things to invest money you have left over when you already have a stable income. Especially with all the professional help there is from brokerages. Rick's Fantasy league is next best thing
2619 2018-10-30 09:57:42 You’ve always been great at picking stocks.

2623 2018-10-30 09:54:20 @puorilife I have sent several emails via your website contact form, emailed generic replies I’ve got and tried to email EU staff I’ve dealt with in the past. No response from anyone 10 days later. I’m an affiliate who stocks your products. Is there any likelihood of contact?
2624 2018-10-30 09:54:10 You would always sell stocks at wrong price, even it would go up higher after your selling, and it's out of your prediction, only when it reach your calculated value. It's your valuation system concepts, and trading principles.
2625 2018-10-30 09:54:04 Cool :)
I am too swing teading, but in the crypto space.

2631 2018-10-30 09:46:19 Even valuation a stock/company is difficult, and it's a systematic method thinking model, and it's changing every day, the market changes, the macroeconomics environment changes, everything is always unpredictable. it's hard to sell stocks at exact price.
2632 2018-10-30 09:45:54 Even the stock market is tanking so  the dip in stocks the drop speaks eloquently the disaster this lazy oaf is. According to reports he does nothing more than watch tv tweet and spout nonsense 9 hrs a day- the emperor has no clothes or brains a spoiled brat on steroids

2634 2018-10-30 09:43:30 The list of stocks which became huge multibaggers after I sold has become larger than my age now.  The opportunity cost profit pool would be 40-50x my current porftolio size.
2635 2018-10-30 09:42:57 A t’entendre, le vol à l’étalage signe la disparition des mangas en librairies, GMS, magasins culturels... C’est faux.

2637 2018-10-30 09:41:56 Same here. I paused my trading account about 3 weeks now but activated my long term investment account and have been nibbling large cap growth and some value stocks.
2638 2018-10-30 09:41:18 Another curious thing Ive noticed is stocks have been getting bought after close into mid day and then crushed which suggests there is real selling going on and algos bidding in low liquidity.

2645 2018-10-30 09:37:53 You take some losses during a correction/sell off, but if you add on to certain positions/Stocks you have, you will rack up gains quickly when there's an uptrend again.

2652 2018-10-30 09:34:52 The short report says 67 percent of the volume from Monday was shorts. This stock is listed as one of the heaviest shorted stocks in the otc. They arent trying to cover. They are shorting and its gonna keep going down until that percentage decreases. IMO
2653 2018-10-30 09:34:19 MAGA isn’t moving the needle. Stocks of our homegrown legendary American Automakers are at 8 years low, while Foreign automakers are thriving. Where is the 25% tariffs on Foreign autos you promised? Must protect our own American automakers. Every country in the world does it.
2654 2018-10-30 09:33:55 Signs up in Starbucks saying they have sold out and I overheard a customer being told that there won’t be any more coming in until NEXT YEAR. The American customer walked away muttering they normally have stocks until Thanksgiving ... perhaps that’s why there’s none in the UK 
2655 2018-10-30 09:33:27 Sometimes better lucky than smart. 

See a lot of stocks down 20 - 30% that a month ago I would have regarded as “Yeah, sure, that seems fine.”

That said, nice to see some dislocations.

2659 2018-10-30 09:29:51 Looking through charts, if one believes in IHS, this second dip (even though lower) is leaving some bottoming stocks with right shoulder (not lower lows on the best stocks). Or a few Ws. You really need 2+ days of strength to take advantage. $VKTX $LOXO.
2660 2018-10-30 09:28:54 When u ask someone about their big losses, they name stocks which fell big after they bought.

No one names the stocks that became big multibaggers after they sold , whereas the monetary loss in these was much much higher.
2661 2018-10-30 09:25:43 Portfolio isnt that big.  The only tech im holding long is Apple.  All others I have are MJ stocks which have dipped considerably I've held short and long positions on those.  Just waiting for the dust to clear now.
2662 2018-10-30 09:25:26 So in the grand scheme of things, a sell off is profitable because stocks become cheaper. The cheaper they are, the more you can get. You buy at the right time, or add on to what you have invested already, you double or triple what you had locked in already during the sell off

2666 2018-10-30 09:21:52 So basically when the DOW, S&P, and NASDAQ reach new all-time highs, they have a sell off of about 10% or more to certain levels on a trend line. That's why stock charts are important to see where to buy or sell a stocks. Stocks always bounce up or down on certain key levels.

2677 2018-10-30 09:16:34 ...but all in all, a market correction is normal; a correction is when high valuation stocks/overbought stocks (which are higher priced like Amazon, Google, Netflix, Nividia) sell off to prices they are really valued at.

2683 2018-10-30 09:11:52 Its a combination of many factors: panick from tariffs (China/USA trade tensions), the FED raising interest rate hikes is cooling the economy down, and a lot of stocks have predicted a weaker sales forecast for their 4th quarter earnings due to tariffs...

2687 2018-10-30 09:10:05 You underestimate the power of compounding interest especially if you start investing at an early age.Having said this, fixed income instruments are more useful if your outlook is the safety of your investment.  high returns means investing in riskier assets like stocks.
2688 2018-10-30 09:10:05 The early gains in European stocks didn't last long.. DAX down over 0.5%.. US Futures also off the highs..

2690 2018-10-30 09:06:58 Ah you take the investors perspective and make the point that cap weights leads to too little diversification. I thought "dangerous" referred to economy/systemic risk. But if the Sp500 drops 10% your rather want it to be concentrated in few stocks rather than across board
2691 2018-10-30 09:06:41 When you say 90% of danish catches is MSC-certified, is it measured by number of stocks, fisheries or weight? "90% of danish catches" leaves room for interpretation.

It's all to do with how a portfolio is allocated, i.e fund XYZ will hold 50% of fund in stocks, 50% in bonds. as prices/clients move any diffs in that ratio at month end needs to be addressed, hence you hear the terms over/under weight.

Auto or semiautomatic weapons & bump stocks just aren't necessary outside law enforcement & military.

2874 2018-10-30 06:15:44 I prefer corporate bonds and some muni's.   During the last downturn, our income stayed the same.  We're back into bonds again and can sleep at night.   Stocks are for the big guys.
2875 2018-10-30 06:15:26 Before midcap crash F&O lot size were increased for stocks & indices and it was said that it is to ensure retail investors don't speculate. Now after the crash lot sizes are reduced despite prices coming down.

2939 2018-10-30 05:16:07 Ok investment people, let me see if I have this straight. Tech stocks rise when companies buy each other because more companies will buy each other and you get to cash out. Tech stocks sink when a "correction" is needed, when interest rates might rise.
2940 2018-10-30 05:16:06 People will short stocks! It is their right. People will spread rumours, that is natural. As business promoter you should not care about these petty things! Stupid stand from celebrated Piramal! Never expected it!

2942 2018-10-30 05:15:26 Like any other investment. If u chose the right one.
The deal with Penny stocks is...they dont have to go up much for you to do well. If a .05 stock does well and hits $1, then you just made 20 times your money.  Easier for a $0.05 to make it to a $1 then for a $1 to grow to $20

2997 2018-10-30 04:27:32 Again it sounds like what you are hoping for. I personally live with the lower middle class. What you consider crumbs have benefited me greatly. Jobs= hope.

2999 2018-10-30 04:25:58 The problem is with just 30 / 50 stocks the churn out is too much. The fund suffers with costs. Sadly we don’t have a good broader market index fund we have ETFs but their volumes are pity. Hope some AMC started a decent broad market fund like BSE 100 or BSE 500
3000 2018-10-30 04:24:45 Public stocks on the village green should make a comeback. We could throw rotten eggs, veggies and fruit at his face. Also, meadow muffins, rocks, anvils, a hammer, bobcats, snakes. Yeah. Public stocks on the village green would be a good thing for Devin.
3001 2018-10-30 04:24:41 You are absolutely right and that is my biggest fear.

3027 2018-10-30 04:08:03 So is the stock market crashing right now Trumps fault? The President only has limited influence on the stocks since its driven mainly by businesses. All I’m saying is that if you wanna compare government deficits you can’t compare a recession to a time of expansion.

3043 2018-10-30 03:58:34 SCAMMING the 401Ks:  Corporate executives were given stock options.  They exercised the options.  Shortly thereafter, the executives had their companies do the stock buybacks so the price would rally.  Then they sold the stocks they bought at the higher price. We been scammed.
3044 2018-10-30 03:58:14 I don't think it will just be a recession. It will be a solid crash. Stocks have already been inflated by tax $ given to corporations to inflate their stocks. But the companies aren't worth any more because they put their money into their stocks and not into their actual company.

3216 2018-10-30 02:18:22 Ahhhh? That took long  I bought from an online store here who has their stocks ready. 
3217 2018-10-30 02:16:47 Lme stocks data speculative ..not reflecting real demand supply...
3218 2018-10-30 02:14:59 After their stocks plummeted last week, this boycott is not a show of strength at all.
3219 2018-10-30 02:13:17 sorry dude u r whacked, if we still had public stocks, u would be in one.
3220 2018-10-30 02:13:14 Though YTD div stocks doing worse, no?
3221 2018-10-30 02:13:00 #indusindbank #stocks #Stock it landed near  to Major Support zone  1330-1365.. Avoid Shorting in it.. SHARP BOUNCE MAY COME ANYTIME. Will Post Chart Later!!
3222 2018-10-30 02:12:30 Smsksks it’s about stocks of Big3 dropping and BTS is mentioned lmaoo
3223 2018-10-30 02:12:09 We know this happens. I already mentioned it. It’s not right but it only applies to fish. It’s not about prices but a misguided attempt to conserve fish stocks. Unfortunately prohibiting landing of fish in excess of quotas doesn’t stop them being caught along with those allowed.
3224 2018-10-30 02:11:35 How is it doing good? Interest rates are up, stocks are down massively, cost of living and inflation are both increase across the board more than prior years.
3225 2018-10-30 02:10:09 (1/2) So #HKMA conducted a stress test on banks and concluded they can handle an extreme environment. #USDHKD is again approaching the upper limit of its range as stocks continue declining. Not in the best place should things go wrong...
3226 2018-10-30 02:09:31 Except a lot of stocks / indexes are already down a lot. 
And oversold in the ST. 

We’ll see. 
Today was ugly ugly ugly.
3227 2018-10-30 02:09:27 Stocks In F&O Ban

    Adani Power
3228 2018-10-30 02:08:39 Well for part 3 of the project just by looking at the formulas I need to calculate daily percentage change and overall percentage change for my stocks
3229 2018-10-30 02:08:34 How about starting with banning the sale of AR-15s?  Bump stocks?
3230 2018-10-30 02:08:16 Aye you still doing that stocks investments?
3231 2018-10-30 02:08:07 Going forward they may feel ASM is not even required... They have done their duty to big guys, bringing down the stocks by more than 50%....
3232 2018-10-30 02:07:57 Does TA really work in stocks or does it only become self-fulfilling prophecy? Large group of people looking at the same chart eventually making similar decisions? Coming from a non-finance guy. 
3233 2018-10-30 02:05:31 Felicia is a sphinx who trades stocks as a hobby.
3234 2018-10-30 02:04:09 Time to buy some Facebook stocks 
3235 2018-10-30 02:01:15 if the shoe fits... then congratulations! they have stocks available with your size
3236 2018-10-30 02:01:11 Stocks not acting quite so well..... Time to buy?
3237 2018-10-30 02:00:58 Okay, so the stock market just lost all of its gains in 2018. When/if the market crashes under trump, will it be his fault or the fault of corporations buying their own stocks and massive speculation? You know speculation causes economic crashes right?
3238 2018-10-30 02:00:51 U.S. Market Check

    U.S. stocks fell, with the S&P 500 flirting with a correction as technology shares tumbled after a report the Trump administration was set to press its trade war with China.

    The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose one basis point to 3.09 percent.
3239 2018-10-30 02:00:39 I'm buying stock in Candy Corn first thing in the morning due to all of us who now will buy some just to try this. Stocks will soar because no one really likes how this tastes.....
3240 2018-10-30 02:00:28 Asian stocks erased early declines to nudge higher as investors shrugged off the prospect of U.S. tariffs on all Chinese imports that had weighed on American equities.
3241 2018-10-30 02:00:26 Yeah, but he flirted with the idea of getting rid of due process for gun owners, and let's not forget bump stocks. He's not being very pro 2A and that's a biiig deal.
3242 2018-10-30 02:00:00 Nobody will care, people get tired of bears and particularly big mouth bears. There will be stocks to make money on the long side, and that is what matters
3243 2018-10-30 01:59:44 Dow bottom predictions
The bottom is between 16K-18K.   At that point you want to buy the value stocks that have beaten up for no good reason.
3244 2018-10-30 01:59:02 I know wa, wa, wa. The government never helped me  .poor me except police, fire, roads,armed forces,social security, Medicare, judicial system,need I go on. Stocks are down for the year.i never blamed trump. Cons control everything.
3245 2018-10-30 01:58:56 Global investors (less smart money) ignoring devaluing Chinese stocks is a value opportunity.
3246 2018-10-30 01:57:58 US dividend paying stocks is another option, I'm looking at doing that in a few weeks. Coca Cola, Wells Fargo and many others close to 5-6% dividend yields after conversion to AUD. Many others are also increasing their dividends every year.
3247 2018-10-30 01:56:40 I hope so, boy I'm suffering, hoping for a Nov/Dec rebound, I'm in good stocks, just need the jitters to jitterbug away !
3248 2018-10-30 01:56:35 Correct me if I am wrong "As per Twitter gyaan,low ROCE is against the rules of investing principle"

wanted to buy few good stocks like Tejas network (ROCE:11.77 & ROE :12.48) and piramal (ROCE :8.53 but ROE:23)
But afraiding as ROCE is  less than 15 in both.Can we have commen ?
3249 2018-10-30 01:56:28 I sold off 1/3 of my Apple stock a month ago. Probably should've dumped it all @ $229 and then buy it back when the dumbass in chief fucks up all the tech stocks.
3250 2018-10-30 01:53:06 @realDonaldTrump I have a better suggestion, why don’t we put better control on who gets to purchase guns & also, outlaw bump stocks & assault rifles. It works in countries that are more evolved than ours, (you know like US  was when Obama was Pres)so don’t say it doesn’t work!
3251 2018-10-30 01:52:54 Pataas ng pataas  na naman baba ng importer ng shoes. 
Lahat ng mga kukuha ng mag stocks na ng madami. Papasok na nov at dec.
3252 2018-10-30 01:52:42 From Fox News; "This business leader warns interest rates will slam stocks, economy"! We DO NOT NEED this increase in interest rates!!!
3253 2018-10-30 01:51:40 U.S. Stocks Closed Lower, Giving Up Sharp Gains From Earlier In The Day  Dow Tumbles More Than 200 Points  S&P 500 Closed 0.7% Lower At 2,641.25 After Gaining More Than 1%  Nasdaq Fell 1.6% To 7,050.29
3254 2018-10-30 01:51:22 @RockstarGames I've been playing gta online for about 2 years and I was wondering if you could add stocks to the game (to the online game it's already in the story)
3255 2018-10-30 01:50:55 Sounds very elitist of you . The market dosent represent the whole economy . Only 10% of Americans have stocks . It will recover soon . Lol “ elect Dems “ your a joke !
3256 2018-10-30 01:48:58 Only if you find the right one. You have play with penny stocks constantly. It’s not something you just let sit.
3257 2018-10-30 01:48:38 Gun Control...if no one were allowed to buy AR's, bump stocks, high capacity mags...First Responders would be a lot safer. But you want 'armed guards' everywhere.
3258 2018-10-30 01:48:03 Gun Control...if no one were allowed to buy AR's, bump stocks, high capacity mags...First Responders would be a lot safer. But you want 'armed guards' everywhere.

3262 2018-10-30 01:47:15 Cyrpto, stocks, gold, silver;  all getting pulled down right now. Weed stocks getting slammed. Blockchain etfs in a slow decline.  But, without a doubt,  opportunities are brewing.  If you catch a vibe or a feeling, act on it; trust yourself. Be smart,  be cautious, but act on it
3263 2018-10-30 01:46:45 Gun Control...if no one were allowed to buy AR's, bump stocks, high capacity mags...First Responders would be a lot safer. But you want 'armed guards' everywhere.
3264 2018-10-30 01:46:43 "More selling ahead?" Don't you just hate it when people sell stocks 
3265 2018-10-30 01:46:00 gonna be busy counting stocks and finishing our monthly reports for 3 days straight so kindly @ me when taek is doing menpa :')
3266 2018-10-30 01:45:04 He invests in hedge funds and stocks firstly, second his businesses were bought by a Texan cable company. He's a free lancing professor at CCSU taking no checks from the institute. He was against the Iraq war and it was a part of his campaign in 2006.
3267 2018-10-30 01:44:15 You support bump stocks and civilians walking around w AR-15s, claiming  “2nd Amendment”,  while kids and innocents get shot up. Pathetic.
3268 2018-10-30 01:44:07 WAYFARER COOPERATIVE stocks slump
3269 2018-10-30 01:44:02 Idk anything about buying & trading stocks but I sure as heck went in & traded up like I knew what I was doing. 
3270 2018-10-30 01:43:31 Dagsa parin sa orders sa fairy pero ubusan na ng stocks!!
#fairyskinbaby

Nov na ulit tayo magrakrakan!!
Pang retail muna po stocks ko
Ang hirap maubusan

3271 2018-10-30 01:43:06 @joethepatriotic you don't post facts you dont answer my argument i dont think you understand how arguing works or something? do you like amazon or not those stocks were going and now they are not i heard trump was responsible and it seems to me from the fortune article true
3272 2018-10-30 01:42:16 Interest rates going up. Makes bonds more attractive. Stocks take a hit. Also eats into minuscule wage growth.
3273 2018-10-30 01:41:55 Just remember that the market's cost of capital will fluctuate. If you purchase stocks when the market's cost of capital is higher than yours, you should be happy with the result over time (if your analysis of earnings power is correct)...
3274 2018-10-30 01:41:53 As of 9:35 a.m., PSEi 7,093.71 down 15.32 points or 0.22 percent #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
3275 2018-10-30 01:41:10 Lol.....like Laura knows anything about why stocks move
3276 2018-10-30 01:40:47 Plenty of time for it to rest when I’m dead. In the mean time I need them gains. Tech stocks are bleeding.
3277 2018-10-30 01:40:10 And you don't see the manipulation of the stock market to hurt Trump. It always goes down before Christmas an then back up after the inside ppl buy low then sell high. Also shorting stocks.Learn real life not fantasy land of make believe!
3278 2018-10-30 01:40:05 Hope so.

But the upside is limited, due to the valuation normalization. People would be very cautious chasing the high growth stocks after this correction.

The value / defense / high dividend stocks and sectors, XLP and XLU, would be the next "Safe Haven" dividend plays. IMHO
3279 2018-10-30 01:39:25 Asian stocks fragile as trade tensions escalate
3280 2018-10-30 01:38:53 The cannabis stocks are taking a beating because word is out that revenue will be lower than expected. But, that’s a result of the mishandling of the Govt for not preparing. 4 heavens sake Montreal only has 4 dispensaries to service a coupe million people. The demand is three
3281 2018-10-30 01:37:27 idk about that there's too many factors that go into bitcoins pricing unlike stocks 
3282 2018-10-30 01:36:35 So i bought more $MFIN and $AGX today. #StockMarket #stocks #ValueInvesting is where it is at for the long run. Sleep better at night. #investments

3285 2018-10-30 01:35:17 Thanks @FredericPoliart these are on the #ASX Sharemarket game NOT REAL CASH although I treat it just the same =) 
I am super familiar with $KGN $KGN.ax price action. I've been watching it for afew days & love #DipBuying larger cap stocks. Went exactly to my plan, sold early too!
3286 2018-10-30 01:35:07 Oh please, just wait until after the midterm election. The next "guidance" these tech stocks give will be positive again and miraculously their stock prices will recover. They're downplaying it just to make Trump look bad. But it won't work! #RedWave
3287 2018-10-30 01:34:55 Bloomberg is writing about Weed Stocks, companies and regulations nonstop now.
3288 2018-10-30 01:34:35 Wouldn’t it be something if the stocks just stopped going down without a reason why.
3289 2018-10-30 01:33:59 BULL and BEAR MARKET don’t END easily. 

It usually takes two or three tricky
PULLBACKS up or down to shake out the few remaining emotional investors.

In bear markets, stocks usually open strong and close weak. 

In BULL markets, THEY tend to open weak and CLOSE strong.
3290 2018-10-30 01:33:35 #Nerdling is all excited because he’s going to start learning about the Stock Market tomorrow in his Algebra class. They are each given $10,000 (Read: fake money) to “invest” in stocks of their choice to learn how it works. He’s decided to put it all on @Tesla.
3291 2018-10-30 01:32:33 Not to worry. Glad you got it. You just sit back, relax and enjoy the Arsenal games. I’ll send you some results of how quant works on small and mid cap aussie stocks in due course. #bodleianmodel #asx #arsenal
3292 2018-10-30 01:31:35 When in a bull market & VIX is low, do the opposite:

1. Long the High Growth Stocks and Short the $SPX Index as a hedge. or
2  Long calls on high growth stocks and long puts on $SPX index as a hedge
3. etc. You got the idea.
3293 2018-10-30 01:31:33 @AppleSupport Stocks app and the widget display different values, there's a sync issue. iPhone 7, ios 12.0.1
3294 2018-10-30 01:30:50 Stocks are down today. Obama gets judged over 8 years. Trump less than two. That seems fair. Why is your income down?  What do you do? We heard that crap when ACA was being voted on. How did that turn out?  Tell me something the government does efficiently

3300 2018-10-30 01:28:05 Most wealth is built by ownership of shares in the stock market. 84% of all shares in the stock market are owned by the wealthiest 10% of Americans. 
They should have their stocks ownership capped at 25% of all publically available shares! The rest should be for the rest of us.
3301 2018-10-30 01:27:17 cop up, stocks are down rn
3302 2018-10-30 01:27:11 Oh oh oh. The stocks are overvalued and this is just a correction to those over priced stocks... 

Then why are the stocks with lowest PE, outside of negative PE stocks, performing worse than stock with high PE ratios?
3303 2018-10-30 01:24:41 Still trying to get up to speed on this name, admire your conviction in this and $achn two stocks that don’t get a lot of attention on Biotech Twitter.
3304 2018-10-30 01:24:25 My income is down about 20%. Stocks are down also. It isn't taking anything. Its saving. Money and at the same time helping everyone.  We will save about 8 billion a year as a country. You have every right to buy into the con game, but I will never again.
3305 2018-10-30 01:23:33 A publicly traded company is not publicly nor government owned. It is owned by private citizens that trade ownership on a public marketplace. The primary factor of decisions is what it does to the stock prices. Being associated with something under public backlash hurts stocks.
3306 2018-10-30 01:22:21 Are penny stocks good investments??
3307 2018-10-30 01:21:09 tu fais des manières, on te remplace. Rotation des stocks en flux tendu, jamais en rupture.
3308 2018-10-30 01:21:01 Looks like US Tech stocks are trending towards bleeding edge
3309 2018-10-30 01:20:26 Let’s turn off all the tech companies for a day and see what happens. People don’t realize how integral some tech stocks are in today’s day to day.
3310 2018-10-30 01:20:16 Hoy en dólares es unos de los precios más bajos y que no siguió la inflación y tene en cuenta que desde 2009 hubo una merma de 10.000.000 de cabezas de ganado menos y recién hace dos años se empezó a recuperar Stocks
3311 2018-10-30 01:19:23 They told me to tell you to buy stocks under their parent company.
3312 2018-10-30 01:19:05 Interest rates have been held unreasonably low for some time, and are on the rise.  Stocks will fluctuate as interest rates rise
3313 2018-10-30 01:19:04 I was asking my pops if he’s ever invested in stocks and he said, “Nah, I just have about 5,000 stocks in Oxy that I accumulated before retirement. They’re at $82 a piece right now.”

lmao so you’re saying you got about $400,000 worth of stocks.. lmao
3314 2018-10-30 01:18:32 It's not an amount of people, it's just registration statistics. Your point would be valid if I said "92% of unregistered voters are registering libertarian". That is not what I said. It's similar to me saying a companies stocks have gone up 92%.
3315 2018-10-30 01:18:09 #LigaUruguaya #Goleadores @clubgoesoficial : Jarred Shaw 25, Martín Aguilera 21, @44enano 14 y Deonta Stocks 13 / @ClubTrouvilleUY : Donald Robinson 21, Paul Harrison 16 y @MarcosMarotta 11
3316 2018-10-30 01:16:56 And instead of taking profits we all got greedy. Let's face it these pot stocks were way overvalued.
3317 2018-10-30 01:16:45 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your autism
3318 2018-10-30 01:15:43 @JohnCena Whatever your reason, kudos to you for not working Crown Jewel. WWE stocks are on a downturn, stockholders I know are selling and subscribers are canceling the network. Me, I’m now a lapsed fan of nearly 50 years. Nearly. 

Kudos for staying behind.
3319 2018-10-30 01:13:54 Unfortunately so did the stocks with the damn tariffs. 
3320 2018-10-30 01:13:24 Ahhh! I've been compromised by the Russians!! JK you foolish human. Now buy and/or sell ClearOne $CLRO #Stocks
3321 2018-10-30 01:13:06 The NRA supported the ban on bump stocks.
3322 2018-10-30 01:13:00 I really don't know shit about stocks or investing....I've just been doing a financial fitness program for the past 7 months but it's all been worth it 
3323 2018-10-30 01:11:55 Who needs to make it auto when you can put a bump stock on it? I mean, that's what happened in Vegas. 59 dead, 851 injured. And then Trump said "we're gonna ban bump stocks." Boy, am I glad he did that. Oh wait...HE DIDN'T.
3324 2018-10-30 01:11:53 Damn dude these stocks really took a shit today
3325 2018-10-30 01:11:12 Why We #MAGA ! Border Security & Safety,Repatriation of Billions, USMCA, More ICE,Successfully Moved Embassy to Jerusalem, Out of Iran Disaster,Ended Paris Garbage Agreement,Ended Obamacare Fines,Religous Freedom,Stocks,3.5 Mil Bonuses,All-Time LOW Unemployment! #Trump45 #REDWAVE
3326 2018-10-30 01:11:10 There should be no need for any weapons that have large rounds outside of the police or military. That’s my belief. The trouble is people are using bump stocks and other alterations to make these weapons capable of killing many people.
3327 2018-10-30 01:10:58 US Stocks closed lower as investors worry over Trump threatening to impose tariffs on remaining Chinese imports if talks with Xi Jinping fail during the G-20 Summit #morninghuddle
3328 2018-10-30 01:09:21 I have stocks and am taking a hit and I’m still enjoying this. Fuck him.
3329 2018-10-30 01:08:58 Man this spicy chicken sandwich is so freakin good but I’m seriously about to cry again it’s so spicy my nose is bailing on me rn it’s releasing the stocks hhh
3330 2018-10-30 01:08:33 I think there’s going to be a correction, then I’m going to move back into stocks
3331 2018-10-30 01:08:00 While stocks are at all time highs 
3332 2018-10-30 01:06:43 Yes now its @marklaureano989 turn to visit, I'm sure stocks would take another weekend off to spend time with his family so Mark can come on.
3333 2018-10-30 01:06:23 $SIRI resting on double bottom the market gives good opportunity to get great stocks  at good price
3334 2018-10-30 01:05:40 Fabulous session!!!
3335 2018-10-30 01:05:07 And we need to stop taking @NRA money for our re-election. Nobody needs an AR-15 for anything. I have done hunting and no one needs a weapon designed to kill people. Big magazines, bump stocks and silencers are that that NO civilian needs. Reasonable gun control change now!!!!
3336 2018-10-30 01:04:39 Hey some people just buy stocks but this is more fun.
3337 2018-10-30 01:04:34 Its not bullish at the moment, there are some stocks that will look like bargains in 6 months. there are a lot of market comments and little on stock comments. Eventually, the selling will dry up, and we will know where the bottom is.
3338 2018-10-30 01:04:09 Fucking losing all my money right now, thankfully, I already know that can happen and am not too concerned. These are stocks I bought while working at a company though, at an employee discount and now that I’ve diversified, it’s tanking. It’s been 2 weeks and it’s getting worse.
3339 2018-10-30 01:03:55 And what the heck, man? Twitter stocks? Hell no.

3344 2018-10-30 01:02:23 The trades you make on the less followed stock give better pops dollar for dollar than fang stocks do. And you are in early enough to catch bigger moves % and $ wise. I sure see it.

3347 2018-10-30 01:00:02 The whole secret to winning big in the stock market is not to be right all the time, but to lose the least amount possible when you’re wrong. -William J. O’Neil #stocks
3348 2018-10-30 00:57:02 It is v interesting! Now I have shorted stocks via options, but do not claim by any means to be nearly as good at it as going long. However, a different market environment could really change that. It’s hard to short a bull market. Only time will tell, I’m here for the long haul.
3349 2018-10-30 00:54:42 Where did my stocks go from 2 years ago?
3350 2018-10-30 00:52:21 I was there in ‘99. Is the difference that nobody cares about stocks now? Ask around.
3351 2018-10-30 00:51:56 That’s not quite right. You’re forgetting dividends are paid on stocks too, akin to rent. And you’re cherry picking the year. Pick other years and stocks will outperform significantly. It’s not this simple. Both are good asset classes.
3352 2018-10-30 00:51:53 Flip it - How about selling $1 worth of stocks for 90cents?? Exit door liquidity premium is in demand these days....

3354 2018-10-30 00:51:25 Wages are down the cost of living has gone up. Not everyone has a 401I or can afford stocks. People living paycheck to paycheck haven't seen any growth from the tax scam and that's not an opinion.
3355 2018-10-30 00:51:15 “Af­ter the drops of the past few weeks, 93% of mar­kets in the MSCI All Coun­try World In­dex are trad­ing be­low both their 200-day and 50-day mov­ing av­er­ages, ac­cord­ing to BAML.

3356 2018-10-30 00:49:38 I just don't see much distribution in the net house.  There should be some serious negative net positions at the end of a day where stocks lost ~15%.  Only CIBC was over 100k sold NET.  Meaning lots of buying and selling but not many getting out.

3359 2018-10-30 00:48:41 Asked about possible bipartisan agreements for preventing violence like the recent shooting in Pennsylvania, @IronStache calls for banning bump stocks but says Republicans are blocking that and other proposals that could prevent violence.
3360 2018-10-30 00:47:59 @RonDeSantisFL I know many promises he didn't keep: release his taxes, protect LGBTQ rights, protect our healthcare, ban bump stocks, "I love the dreamers."
3361 2018-10-30 00:47:34 1. Small investors should stick to index funds and not try to pick individual stocks.

2. What Eddy describes is the principle of “Beta” - the market compensates you for accepting risks, so all else being equal, riskier investments return more.
3362 2018-10-30 00:46:30 This is easily found ... We had people slaughtered and parts of the country are drowning but this is how you are using your time ? Even you would tell yourself “your fired” with your current job performance ..oh and by the way hows ur stocks ?

3367 2018-10-30 00:45:07 I doubt we Will see a squeeze at this price. Stocks have been above 350 this year several times, and 2times above 370 and no short squeeze happened.
3368 2018-10-30 00:44:56 Many have made $ on fang and still fang collectively has high return y/y than many stocks - currently there are several overhead risks & which are influencing fang returns closer to market multiples. This process is painful yet they are the generational growth stocks !!!
3369 2018-10-30 00:44:36 Is it possible sir, that besides the robust combat service support ie mechanics for borer patrol it may be an attempt by the administration to task them with building the "wall" using training dollars and class IV stocks to circumvent congressional oversight.

3389 2018-10-30 00:34:17 This is misleading. King opposed the bump stock ban that was part of the 2013 assault gun ban and his statement explaining his vote made him seem misinformed about the bill or bump stocks or both. #mepolitics

3403 2018-10-30 00:29:04 Inflation at ~1%, wages at ~2%.  
Shows how far the RBA are from our muddling 5% unemployment pushing wages and inflation into the target range. Think they've missed the boat though as housing,  stocks and spending plummets, so will wages and employment.

3438 2018-10-30 00:17:26 When you’re dealing with OTC #potstocks, you have to treat them differently than regular stocks. Any information published on OTC stocks is usually paid promotion. So you have to take what is said w/ a grain of salt. You have to be able to spot the pump, and not lose on the dump

3440 2018-10-30 00:16:40 That's the problem with individual stocks.  The price can fluctuate so much that the dividends don't necessarily make up for the amount of money you're losing on owning the stocks.
3441 2018-10-30 00:15:54 U.S. stocks fell in a volatile session Monday, with the benchmark S&P 500 index ending close to confirming its 2nd correction of 2018.

3443 2018-10-30 00:14:22 Mid-terms are Nov 6th. Same thing happened for the presidential election. As long as Republicans win, the stocks will recover. People do not know if Trump's regulation cutbacks will stay if Republicans lose.
3444 2018-10-30 00:14:19 Immigration to Toronto and GTA/GHA should moderate the drop but there is NO doubt a drop is coming.  Too many people are too highly levered.  Watch thebig 5 bank stocks for clues (and HCG is a basket case raised ST deposit rates last week 75bp)
3445 2018-10-30 00:13:43 All you "cannabis entrepreneurs" are the same. Profiteers fighting over who deserves to get rich instead of fighting for an inclusive Cannabis country.

3451 2018-10-30 00:10:41 Ooo I like the stocks comparison but that’s very mathematical with time series analysis which is much more predictive because the data points are dependent on the previous month or year or whatever.

3469 2018-10-30 00:02:51 Suns look to have made final list changes. Jesse Lonergan delisted. Scheer and Wigg will be moved from primary list to rookies. Looks like Jack Leslie survives. With May gone and Spencer delisted, keeping Leslie was a no-brainer with limited key defensive stocks.

3472 2018-10-30 00:02:05 I guess there is a fundamental difference between those that believe that the QE element is part of the stocks ‘value’ and those that don’t #FunnyMoney
3473 2018-10-30 00:01:45 & something tells that with more interest hike in our future (TBD).. The slide will only continue for a couple months++ of volatile swings.. coming to a market near you.  Hopefully you heeded the year+ of warnings & moved out of Stocks & into something safer ..for now ;-)
