4 2018-02-22 23:59:55 @AyoCaesar Just seen you on #bbcqt not keen on your politics but if you're really a champion please count me in. A definite tick and gold star from me.
5 2018-02-22 23:59:54 Silver is nothing to scoff at-2nd best in world. Sends a really bad message to young athletes everywhere. The game, the competition, &the teamwork are all just as important as gold. Don’t give me wrong- everyone would like to have a goal but be proud of your hard work & smile!
6 2018-02-22 23:59:53 So Maddie Rooney won the US women’s hockey team gold.. does that mean @DoveCameron gets an honorary gold?

46 2018-02-22 23:59:08 "Jocelyne Larocque"  It's not just Jocelyne.... 4 years ago I watched our girls win Gold and was disgusted by the US reaction when they got the Silver medals. It was disgusting. This was worse. The whole team need to learn to lose with Grace and Dignity like true Canadians!!!!!
47 2018-02-22 23:59:08 @survivetheark Do to bad wether I cant go buy a gold card so the 2 fucking months I spent on a pve server is going to be fucking lost becuase of you fucking asses. A huge waste of my god damn time. You need to spend more time fixing you mechanics like removing host tethering

50 2018-02-22 23:58:58 That’s basically what you’re implying Rob. So. Do you feel this way about the Women’s hockey not winning gold last night? Or if the men fail to advance/win will you feel the same way?
51 2018-02-22 23:58:53 For those of us sleeping during the women’s hockey gold win-the replay of game was awesome-no nail biting knowing we won! So fun & so deserving of the gold!

80 2018-02-22 23:57:43 I knew she scored before I watched the replay, I still cried when the women won the gold. So proud of the women.
81 2018-02-22 23:57:41 #CAN so sad.  Please help.  What countries were the referees from in Can/USA women’s hockey gold medal game.

89 2018-02-22 23:57:24 It sure is easy for people watching from their couches to call out Canada's #JocelyneLarocque for poor sportsmanship, but none can understand the emotional toll it takes to work so hard & come so close to gold. Especially when Canada has won gold since 2002!
90 2018-02-22 23:57:22 Watching the #usawomenshockey team beat Canada to win gold last night was so exciting I still haven't calmed down. Highlight of the olympics

96 2018-02-22 23:57:09 im not for taking guns away, at least the non-assault rifles. The only place imo a civilian should be able to touch an AR-15 is at gun ranges. And if you’re allowed to own one, it should be a collector’s item and unable to fire

118 2018-02-22 23:56:14 Happy to report terrific support from the City of Andover, its mayor and its residents for a parade honoring gold medal goalie Maddie Rooney. Some details to be worked out yet but my community is on the case.

122 2018-02-22 23:55:58 I would’ve gotten gold today for the mammoth pothole I swerved to miss. My pothole dodging skill is getting insanely good. #indyisapothole #makepotholedodgingaOlympicsport

136 2018-02-22 23:55:33 This was by  far my favorite Olympic moment!!! I grew up watching @kikkanimal  ski and I am soo happy she finally got a Olympic medal and it is GOLD!!!
137 2018-02-22 23:55:33 If it were me id tax the hell outta gun owners. And a few extra security guards isn't that bad of an environment i get what your saying tho. But that a sacrifice id be welling to make.
138 2018-02-22 23:55:33 Today on @JayAndDan @Pchiddy brought some much needed perspective when he commented on how his gold medal will someday end up stored away in a shoe box but what he has “learned along the way” will be a more important part of his legacy. Thanks Patrick! #Olympics
139 2018-02-22 23:55:32 Best game ever!!!!! Congratulations job well done. You deserve the GOLD!
140 2018-02-22 23:55:28 I’ll be honest, it shows absolutely no class to take off your medal while you are on the podium, even when you don’t get the gold you wanted. It also doesn’t show much pride for your country.
141 2018-02-22 23:55:22 So you're saying that it's natural for all Canadian women to have inferiority complexes and be ungrateful if they don't win gold medals in the #Olympics? 
142 2018-02-22 23:55:21 It’s something about August part in “gold slugs” shit make my  skip beats!! 
143 2018-02-22 23:55:19 Tough moment to appreciate after losing Gold in penalty shots. After 20 minutes of extra hockey. I see where you’re coming from and not knocking it. But I’m not going to diss an athlete showing true emotions. Sometimes refreshing to see someone hate losing.
144 2018-02-22 23:55:18 thanks to @NBCSN for replaying the women's gold medal game!  I'm so proud of those women!!!  THEY ARE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
145 2018-02-22 23:55:17 HE PAYS GOLD SO MUCH HE JUST DOESNT FOLLOW I DONT UNDERSTAND
146 2018-02-22 23:55:12 Intrinsic value means: real wealth, it is what you have inside.
Like gold and silver, always keep its value. 
147 2018-02-22 23:55:09 Gold! Do you have pics?
148 2018-02-22 23:55:07 Loved series 2 especially the early episodes but series 1 goes down as possibly the greatest telly ever - stick a brilliant script and a bunch of amazing actors in a hut in Germany and get comedy gold!
149 2018-02-22 23:55:06 Congratulations to the #USWomensHockey team for bringing home the gold. 
150 2018-02-22 23:54:58 MPJ officially cleared for Mizzou and USA finally beat Canada to win the gold in women’s hockey. It’s been a good couple of days!

152 2018-02-22 23:54:56 Is there a children’s flatulence contest? If so, where? Both our’s need to pickup their boys and girls gold medals. @AlorraineW24

156 2018-02-22 23:54:49 If Americans did this we’d be getting dragged for being self centered, thinking we deserve it etc  but cuz she’s Canadian and hockey is big there it’s ok? GTFOH it’s poor sportsmanship and spits on those who worked to earn a silver, HAPPILY! She’s lost the gold and her respect

159 2018-02-22 23:54:40 Towers of gold are still too little. These hands could hold the world but it'll never be enough
160 2018-02-22 23:54:38 As the #USA continues to look the other way #RoyalMaya continues to make great progress. Our strategic Allies see the value in a new sovereign nation backed by a #Gold and #Silver currency. Our nations and its people will prosper thru trade, oil, and a stable currency.
161 2018-02-22 23:54:38 You should watch Running Brave. Starring Robby Benson. It was about a Dakota Runner named Billy Mills who won a gold medal in the 1964 Olympics. Benson is white. It was filmed in Canada where there are a ton of Aboriginal actors. Whitewashing has gone on for a while
162 2018-02-22 23:54:33 Meanwhile US Men's hockey hasn't got an Olympic gold since 1980, why do they even have a program for them.
163 2018-02-22 23:54:32 I'm glad I got to see the replay of The Women's @usahockey Gold Metal victory. Hell of a job, ladies! #USA! #USA!! #USA!!! #Olympics2018
164 2018-02-22 23:54:28 Nice! Thanks for the info on the corn broom. If you ever find yourself in Des Moines, hit us up! We’d love to buy you and the ‘stache a beer or two. Good luck on the gold!

168 2018-02-22 23:54:26 I think @Jumpman23 / @Nike needs to give @usahockey ‘s @JocelyneUSA17 a contract. Her deke on that shootout goal was reminiscent of the greatest.

169 2018-02-22 23:54:20 "smear of fecal pap", god, this thread is a gold mine.
170 2018-02-22 23:54:19 Feel bad for the people who watched the replay of the U.S. women's hockey team taking the gold. @NHLonNBCSports failed to show the players getting their gold medals.
171 2018-02-22 23:54:17 @HilaryKnight getting drug tested right after the gold medal game is just so #IOC... Where were you in #Sochi??? 
172 2018-02-22 23:54:15 …………？

174 2018-02-22 23:54:11 Lmfao this is gold!
175 2018-02-22 23:54:09 Well they’ve got over $700M in liquidity if you include cash, marketable securities in revolver. Heck, that’s more than enough to buy Atlantic Gold. And still have money left over all while adding very low cost ounces in another favorable jurisdiction.

177 2018-02-22 23:54:07 So, 4 years ago, US acted like brats when the won the Silver medal in women's hockey. Canada's time to act like brats. Neither act was a good example of gamesmanship. "Heck Rich, it's about winning the gold or we wasted 4 years of our time." Okay.

183 2018-02-22 23:53:59 that's really what im hoping. Now if you own any of the Nike Yeezy's they're like gold. Not sure the Drake J's will get to that level, but should be a bump in price for sure.
184 2018-02-22 23:53:58 I don't see why you need my rebuttal when the comment section of that article pretty much echoes most of what I would say. seriously, the comment section is a gold mind for rebuttals and arguments against that article. people are saying stuff I haven't even thought off.
185 2018-02-22 23:53:54 We couldn’t be prouder! Team Canada is solid gold in our hearts!

195 2018-02-22 23:53:33 Congratulations to the Womens USA hockey team for winning the gold medal. Both teams should hold their heads high. The Canadian team fought a valiant fight and should be proud. That game was one of the best of all the games and could have gone either way!
196 2018-02-22 23:53:32 At @Chilis watching a rerun of the USA women’s gold metal game from last night. @emilynoll9 is cheering like it’s live. Some dude walks by and goes “you know this game was on at 1 am”

207 2018-02-22 23:53:11 Apparently the gold tickets are Matsu only..... atsushi......... someday......................
208 2018-02-22 23:53:08 I kinda wanna see June's Diary in gold, red, or white.
209 2018-02-22 23:53:06 He could buy some gold from you and say he found it.
210 2018-02-22 23:53:04 I don't hate it, I just feel like it could use a couple more details. I'm glad it doesn't have that weird fake collar that the last one had. Agreed on the home shirt. I just really would love a black or red or gold 3rd kit one day
211 2018-02-22 23:53:01 Again.  Those that rally against the "elites" voted for a guy who lost 900 million owning casinos, lives in a penthouse apt in NYC in a building with his name on it, and has gold toilets.  What is more elite than that?
212 2018-02-22 23:52:59 Why have I got the attention span of a gold fish ?

214 2018-02-22 23:52:54 I agree. This idea that “if only there was a good guy with a gun” is Fool’s Gold.
215 2018-02-22 23:52:51 All of you played like champions. But you’re right, her fake and her hands were unreal. Congrats. Thanks for brining home the gold.
216 2018-02-22 23:52:49 Now following @moelogo. I heard Happy ft Adekunle Gold yesterday and the song was pure bliss. I just downloaded all his tracks available on @BoomplayMusicNG . Sadly, there are only 7 songs available, I want more .
217 2018-02-22 23:52:49 Ánimo, ya solo es un mes y, además, ya han anunciado que es gold así que no habrá más retrasos.

231 2018-02-22 23:52:02 Not knowing much about him before, I kinda thought he was a thoughtful guy who went out on a limb to express an opinion. That was until he race libeled a small business for attention and pointed a gun at a poor woman’s head. Sorry if I’m not wild about him wearing green and gold
232 2018-02-22 23:52:00 Oh the U.S. women’s hockey team really did THAT and won gold for the first time in 30 years and ended Canada.... men really ain’t shit
233 2018-02-22 23:51:58 @Xbox me and my brothers consoles can’t play games for some reason when we both have gold and i have bought games and downloaded them and it says i need to sign in to play them when I’m already signed in??????

250 2018-02-22 23:51:33 I agree with that as well. Mandatory background checks and mental evaluations every 6 months. Its just not realistic to take them all away

259 2018-02-22 23:51:15 I’m going to start investing in gold, silver, and AR-15s.
260 2018-02-22 23:51:13 Bro this was hilarious @Lilnickmalachi comedic Gold
261 2018-02-22 23:51:05 Nope. As soon as I saw it was going to a shootout I turned the TV off. No game at the Olympics should end in a shootout, ESPECIALLY a gold-medal game.
262 2018-02-22 23:51:00 That is okay you guys still played good  and there is always next time at least you guys made it to the gold medal round .
263 2018-02-22 23:51:00 it’s about fucking time amanda kessel & hilary knight are olympic gold medalists
264 2018-02-22 23:50:54 The NHL didn't go to the Olympics but I got to watch the rerun of the U.S.A. women's team win gold and that was awesome.
265 2018-02-22 23:50:54 I wanna shout it from the rooftops when I find new music like hello listen it’s gold
266 2018-02-22 23:50:52 Come by tonight and toast @stephanifost on her new Gold Medal for picking up shifts. $4 @3floyds Gumbalhead pints too.
267 2018-02-22 23:50:49 I realize that your original tweet was before her dash for gold, but  Jessie Diggins deserves to be remembered for her securing the first gold medal in USA X-Country skiiing history.  Unfortunately, for her, it's not a marquis sport.

271 2018-02-22 23:50:43 Still in agreement on the shootout for a Gold Medal game. Let the teams decide it in OT. If the team you don't like wins and deserves to win, then that's the best result for the game. Not gonna fault a guy for cheering for his home country. #respect
272 2018-02-22 23:50:41 たぶんじょうだんｗ
273 2018-02-22 23:50:37 The cutest group of grandmas just walked into the gym with a boom box & they all had on matching black jackets that’s said “Golden Grannies” in gold across the back. They were all ready to get down. Freaking love it!!
274 2018-02-22 23:50:31 a gold medal deserving streak of lethargy.

Never be enough.

286 2018-02-22 23:49:50 Gold
287 2018-02-22 23:49:46 I consider myself a pretty patriotic person, but there’s just some special feeling when watching a American win gold in the olympics.
288 2018-02-22 23:49:46 Did I just rewatch the USA gold medal hockey game against Canada? YUUUUUUP! Just as sweet as the first time.
289 2018-02-22 23:49:46 If I had a Gold Toilet I'd stare at it all day too
290 2018-02-22 23:49:42 I was just fucking top 10 with full health, full shield, a scar, chug jug, a bolty, gold grenade launcher, purple tac sub, AND FORTNITE CLOSES ITSELF OUT WHAT THE FUCK

292 2018-02-22 23:49:41 Just finished watching the women's gold-medal game. Again....
293 2018-02-22 23:49:40 Literally just cried watching the USA girls win gold 
294 2018-02-22 23:49:35 Trivia : #CAN hadn't lost a game in the Olympics since they lost the gold medal game to #USA in 1998.
295 2018-02-22 23:49:31 Eu faria o gold, ja temos um time
296 2018-02-22 23:49:28 Good morning Japan! Hello NY!  Today I will decide the figure skating girls' champion. Who will take the gold medal? I am looking forward to beautiful acting!

#NY　#USA　#Olympics 　#Olympics2018 　#accea
297 2018-02-22 23:49:23 If anyone has got a spare hour and 10 minutes or so, have a listen to Ep 2 of @ChuckLoversPod discussing #FatherTed. Basically, it's my mate @StevenChicken with @SachinNakrani and @shockproofbeats Comedy Podcast Gold of which they should all be rightly proud

300 2018-02-22 23:49:09 Definitely gonna be re-watching USA women’s hockey team win gold again this weekend #Merica
301 2018-02-22 23:49:07 Seeing the Women's Gold Medal Olympic Hockey Team singing the National Anthem was very moving for me!!!
302 2018-02-22 23:49:05 Congratulations to our women's hockey team on their gold.  They didn't take a f...ing knee!  Stand tall ladies.
303 2018-02-22 23:49:05 ほとに？
304 2018-02-22 23:49:04 Just caught the replay of @usahockey defeating Canada for ... WHAT A THRILLING VICTORY!!! Even though I knew the outcome, I was so hype watching the replay!! #GoTeamUSA #GOLD #WinterOlympics
305 2018-02-22 23:49:02 Louden, kind and considerate and respectful: Finland got the bronze.

Me, very patriotic: Who cares? America got gold. (hand in air, pointing to sky) USA USA USA
306 2018-02-22 23:48:59 Just watched the replay of Team USA women's gold medal win... Amanda Kessel's snipe in the shootout looked eerily a lot like Phil's shot. So awesome.
307 2018-02-22 23:48:50 These awful people who have no experience,  no life time exposure to violence, blood,  guns,  only know artificial environment and gold plated indoor plumbing
Have 
No 
Fucking
Clue.
308 2018-02-22 23:48:49 Honest to god if forgetting about yer cuppa til it goes cold n then panicking n downing it in 3 seconds was an Olympic sport I’d have about 673 gold medals x

310 2018-02-22 23:48:41 isn’t the best solution making it harder for the people that wish to do harm to get guns?
311 2018-02-22 23:48:40 Oh God this is such a thing for me because sometimes, depending upon your expectations, you win a silver and sometimes you lose a gold. It's actually kind of a thing in the MS I'm writing right now. It's SO tough.
312 2018-02-22 23:48:39 i'm gonna give you a gold experience lol
313 2018-02-22 23:48:38 Shoutout to NBC for airing a closeup of a US women’s hockey player mouthing “let’s get fucked” after winning gold 
314 2018-02-22 23:48:35 @aRigs33 Congratulations on winning a gold medal! You’re the best in the world! #usawomenshockey #Gold #33
315 2018-02-22 23:48:34 Just saw the shootout. Glad our women won, but there’s no way an Olympic gold medal should be decided on a shootout. Keep playing.
316 2018-02-22 23:48:30 The gold stereo headset
317 2018-02-22 23:48:29 Jeez that is gold
318 2018-02-22 23:48:28 I’ll let this speak for itself: “Many in legacy media love mass shootings. You guys love it,” NRA rep Dana Loesch said during a speech at the CPAC. “I’m not saying you guys love the tragedy but I am saying you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold.” #neveragain
319 2018-02-22 23:48:26 So I walk in to my dad yelling from the couch, “U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!” because the girls hockey just won the gold medal in the olympics..... it’s the little things that make me realize we are more alike than I think because we are both really really dumb
320 2018-02-22 23:48:25 Gold
321 2018-02-22 23:48:24 Our girls winning the gold is the best part of these olympics!! #TeamUSAwomensHockey
322 2018-02-22 23:48:23 Now, if only this had been recorded...instant viral video gold 
323 2018-02-22 23:48:21 It’ll look much better with some maroon and gold in it this weekend.  Will be a blast, the barn will be packed! #GoDevils #SunDevilGrit
324 2018-02-22 23:48:15 @usahockey thank you ladies you make us all so proud. Congrats on the gold
325 2018-02-22 23:48:13 The print and all the gold. T'Challa's was much better
326 2018-02-22 23:48:11 Gold
327 2018-02-22 23:48:11 Just caught the replay of overtime and shootout of the US gold medal hockey win.

Thrilling showdown between two crazy athletic goalies. Blinding game.
328 2018-02-22 23:48:07 USA  Women’s hockey bringing home the gold. Woot woot. #whoruntheworld #girls
329 2018-02-22 23:48:03 It was great the women’s US hockey team won the gold but I’m not that impressed. A real team would’ve won in regulation, a shutout preferably. #NBColympics #usawomenshockey
330 2018-02-22 23:48:01 Ok I cried a little just now watching the US women’s hockey sing and celebrate after winning gold.
331 2018-02-22 23:48:00 you can change your profile to Gold medal winner now!
332 2018-02-22 23:47:59 We just watch the replay of the @TeamUSA women’s hockey gold match against Canada. Holy smokes those women are tough and deserve every bit of that medal. #OlympicGames #OlympicHockey
333 2018-02-22 23:47:59 How do you know when a sporting event has been extraordinary? When you watch a replay, knowing the outcome and it's still riveting. Thanks and congrats @usahockey #Gold #usahockey Shootout winner was SICK!!!
334 2018-02-22 23:47:57 Kudos to the USA Women's Hockey Team on yesterday's Gold-Medal WIN!!!

337 2018-02-22 23:47:54 Hey @calgarystampede, @ScottMoir and @tessavirtue are going to be the 2018 Calgary Stampede parade marshals right? I'm right, right? #yyc #calgarystampede #Gold #Canada #Olympics
338 2018-02-22 23:47:47 I’d so much rather win an Olympic gold than a sports championship.
339 2018-02-22 23:47:46 Is it black and blue or white and gold? xD

342 2018-02-22 23:47:40 Brilliant - SNP MP is only concerned about how the BBC describes a group of highly paid public servants withdrawing their labour in a monopoly situation in protest about an adjustment to a gold plated pension that most can only dream about - #grievancemonkey
343 2018-02-22 23:47:40 Watched a replay and knew the outcome of the women's gold medal game and still cheered when the USA won! #WinterOlympics #USAvsCAN #Gold

347 2018-02-22 23:47:32 Stay Gold Ponyboy.
348 2018-02-22 23:47:32 Even knowing the outcome, it was breath taking to see the USA Women on the replay of the Gold Medal Winning game.  #Olympics 
Love the Eagle on the side of the mask of the USA Goalie.

352 2018-02-22 23:47:28 Another dispiriting, soul-sucking day in America: NRA lunatic says "legacy media" love mass shootings as "ratings gold;" armed deputy did nothing while school shootings went on; Trump ridiculously ramps up rhetoric on armed teachers as end-all deterrents (nuns with  guns?).
353 2018-02-22 23:47:24 Got a second look at this gold medal game between the US and Canada. Best hockey game I've seen since Game 7 of the '94 Stanley Cup Finals. Yes, I'm showing my Rangers bias.
354 2018-02-22 23:47:18 Gold times do J.A
355 2018-02-22 23:47:16 Americans were lucky to win gold won't be so lucky next time
356 2018-02-22 23:47:14 the gold medal for not being ok
357 2018-02-22 23:47:13 Stay gold
358 2018-02-22 23:47:13 USA Women with the W in hockey for the gold!!!! Canada couldn’t win at their own sport
359 2018-02-22 23:47:10 Black on Black again, I might Gold the trim
360 2018-02-22 23:47:08 So fun to get to watch the women's @usahockey #Gold game from last night #Olympics Thanks @NBCSN

366 2018-02-22 23:46:59 @RealMikeWilbon A gold medal in women’s hockey doesn’t carry as much weight as one in curling? Really? Hop scotch requires more athletic ability than curling. This is not a sport. It’s a giant board game.
367 2018-02-22 23:46:57 "FIRST US WOMEN'S HOCKEY GOLD IN 20 YEARS--"
 Woohoo, cool!
"--SINCE THE 1998 GAMES"
 wait what
368 2018-02-22 23:46:54 @NBCNews forgot to mention Gold medal just now on broadcast for USA women’s team cross country skiing !

375 2018-02-22 23:46:26 the crap shoot decides the gold medal game ffs
376 2018-02-22 23:46:26 The precipitation you see today is from Canadian tears from them losing the Gold Medal hockey game last night and the curling match today
377 2018-02-22 23:46:14 With @usahockey Women taking a well earned GOLD medal, I wonder if the time is right for a commemorative set of cards celebrating their equally impressive 20 year run along side our @HC_Women.

I may secretly want a few autos of some key players. #Shhhhh
378 2018-02-22 23:46:14 Woohoo!! USA Women Hockey win GOLD!! What an amazing game!!!
379 2018-02-22 23:46:09 Going gold too
380 2018-02-22 23:46:07 No, go back in time.. @Tessab25 and many other were tweeting before the shootout began how much they hated the idea of it in the gold medal game.
381 2018-02-22 23:46:07 Letting the girls out for a little fresh air?
382 2018-02-22 23:46:00 Just watched the #USWomensHockey Gold Medal Win.. And what a win! Such a beautiful group of young ladies. We all should embrace this win.  #Olympics

389 2018-02-22 23:45:46 Just watched the replay of the women's #icehockey gold medal game. My body is thankful I didn't stay up to see it last night but my heart wishes I had. That was a great game. #USAvsCAN #Olympics

392 2018-02-22 23:45:35 My life would be so much easier if someone could cook for me every day. Don’t get me wrong I know how to cook I just find it so long most days.
393 2018-02-22 23:45:34 #OlympicHockey #USHockey This Canadian offers huge congrats to the US team for winning Gold! Both teams gave us terrific entertainment & reasons to cheer. It could have gone either way with these fast, talented women's teams. Wow!

396 2018-02-22 23:45:28 Am I a bad parent for letting my six year old watch the replay of the women's gold medal hockey game without telling him the outcome? Kid was in agony the whole overtime and shootout but man was he excited when they won!
397 2018-02-22 23:45:27 All that glitters is not gold.
398 2018-02-22 23:45:27 @mduggan10 Have a close up pic of your GOLD ? 
399 2018-02-22 23:45:27 I will say that these winter games have been pretty disappointing for the US. I would say Shaun White's gold medal run and women's hockey have been the highlights for the Americans. Norway has been busy racking up all the medals.
400 2018-02-22 23:45:26 USA Women’s Hockey just won gold, and now I’m crying. #USAvsCAN

Not all people are human.
404 2018-02-22 23:45:16 The women’s hockey gold-medal game was a thing of beauty. The rest of the Olympics was a complete waste of time.
405 2018-02-22 23:45:15 Yeah that black and gold does it much justice
406 2018-02-22 23:45:14 Just now able to watch the #USA vs #Can women's gold hockey game. That has to be the best #PyeongChang2018 hockey game, men or womens,  I've watched. What a great group of shootout goals! #USA #Gold

409 2018-02-22 23:45:05 Ok, I admit it. I bugged out of the last half of my latest session to come back to my room and watch the final/shootout of team USA women’s hockey winning the gold...Again. I could watch it 100 more times and still get goosebumps. #ipdx18
410 2018-02-22 23:45:05 I'm wondering if now someone will actually be crazy enough to run KH2FM Lvl1 Crit Gold Crown or even JJ. That strat for Mushroom 5 is absolutely insane though, really impressive how it's even possible and that someone managed to find it after all those years. :D

423 2018-02-22 23:44:40 And even if one considers Thermopylae a Persian black eye, the height of armed resistance against a despot, just remember: a generation later, the Spartans were funded by Persian gold against their fellow Hellenes.
424 2018-02-22 23:44:37 I know I'm late...but what a gold medal game for USA womens hockey ! What a shootout ! What a game !

431 2018-02-22 23:44:26 Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold are the only notable forks at this point.

Bitcoin Cash will be the primary currency blockchain with the most features while Bitcoin Gold will fill the niche role of asic resistance for a little while longer.

Crypto will grow up soon.
432 2018-02-22 23:44:26 Congratulations US Women’s hockey for winning the gold in OT and a Shoot out!!
433 2018-02-22 23:44:22 Here's something else to consider. The same political machine that elected Greitens elected many in the state legislature. Of the same moral character. A gold mine for media.
434 2018-02-22 23:44:21 That finale to the Canada vs USA gold medal game was book worthy. What a final shot in the shootout by Team USA. #TeamUSA #womenshockey #OlympicGames
435 2018-02-22 23:44:19 Just watched the re-run of the U.S. Women’s hockey team taking Gold!  What a match!  Go team USA!!  @NBCOlympics @TeamUSA
436 2018-02-22 23:44:17 .@sleepykokiri and I are sitting at a bar watching the US women’s hockey team beat Canada for the gold medal 
437 2018-02-22 23:44:16 I would be dancing in front of her with my gold 
438 2018-02-22 23:44:14 あーうん、そうだな……（ボーッとしているようです）
439 2018-02-22 23:44:14 The girl rolling her eyes at a bunch of waffling panel members on #bbcqt when they keep missing her point EVEN after she clarifies it a second time is comedy gold. You go girl. This lot are clueless 
440 2018-02-22 23:44:14 If ignoring people was an Olympic sport, you’ve got the gold 
441 2018-02-22 23:44:13 #TeamUSA!!!!!  Women's Hockey...GOLD!!!!!!! 
442 2018-02-22 23:44:11 Just watched the US Women’s hockey gold medal winning game (again). Great stuff!
443 2018-02-22 23:44:05 Bum.. disgrace 2 the purple & gold
444 2018-02-22 23:44:00 Just watched the #usawomenshockey #gold medal game with my kids. That. Was. AMAZING. #Olympics2018
445 2018-02-22 23:43:59 Nick Foles and the Eagles win the Super Bowl.
Austin Dillon in the "3" car wins Daytona 500.
USA women's hockey wins gold after 20 years.

It's only February. Good year in sports.
446 2018-02-22 23:43:58 My hometown
447 2018-02-22 23:43:57 I cried so many happy tears tonight! That was beautiful. I loved the way Aaron broke up with Alex; his line "I miss him" about Robert had such pained truth. Robert saying "Of course I want you, you idiot," was gold! Aaron's speech to Robert at the end was perfection.  #robron
448 2018-02-22 23:43:57 Congrats to the Women’s USA Hockey Team for an exciting 6 Round Shootout for Gold! @TeamUSA
449 2018-02-22 23:43:54 But, since I am of the view that the medium/long term price of gold is much higher, even #paf might do well - but substantially better plays in the sector
450 2018-02-22 23:43:53 Just watched the replay of the US women's hockey team take the gold medal. So proud of all those MN connections! #WayToGoMN
451 2018-02-22 23:43:53 This United States v. Canada hockey game has turned me into a fan. THRILLING! 

USA takes Gold, first time since '98. #GoTeamUSA #USAvsCAN
452 2018-02-22 23:43:52 I got home in time to see the replay of the women's team winning the gold in hockey and I'm not embarrassed to say it brought a tear to my eye.
453 2018-02-22 23:43:50 So 40 plus people clapping at bar watching #USAvsCAN on tape delay after #usawomenshockey wins #Gold #WeownCanada
454 2018-02-22 23:43:50 GOLD TEAM RULES
455 2018-02-22 23:43:48 Rewatching the Gold medal Ladies game. Awesome.
456 2018-02-22 23:43:44 Just watched the re-run of the USA Canada women’s hockey gold metal game and all I have to say is GIRL MF POWER
457 2018-02-22 23:43:41 うむ

464 2018-02-22 23:43:28 Whoa ho! That was a real zinger! Keep them coming. Don’t keep that kind of comedy gold all to yourself. Let your intellect shine. The public awaits.
465 2018-02-22 23:43:28 Congratulationto the women’s hockey team on their gold-medal what a game and what a team!
466 2018-02-22 23:43:21 I just watched the replay of the #USAvCAN gold medal game and wow...it wasabsolutely amazing. Congratulations ladies!

468 2018-02-22 23:43:17 Even though I knew how the game ended, I’m crying as I watch the rerun of the Women’s Hockey gold medal match.
469 2018-02-22 23:43:14 お！？すまねぇ…ティッツァが呼んでるみてぇだ　またな
470 2018-02-22 23:43:13 Our Women's Olympic Hockey just seized gold over Canada... Ill drink to that
471 2018-02-22 23:43:12 Even though I knew USA won, I just got chills watching the end of that gold medal match from last night. 
472 2018-02-22 23:43:10 Rewatching gold medal game women's hockey shootout @maddie_rooney35 comes up huge for US

475 2018-02-22 23:43:06 I love Canada!  And yet seeing US Women's Hockey win gold is everything I needed right now!
476 2018-02-22 23:43:05 2.8 Million viewers for #USAvsCAN Gold medal game on NBC Sports Network Wednesday night. 956,000 viewers for USA Men Hockey loss to Czech Rep which aired on CNBC on Tuesday. #WinterOlympics
477 2018-02-22 23:43:05 i'm not good at sports but want to win a gold medal
478 2018-02-22 23:43:04 Just finished watching the Gold Medal game, what a performance!!  Incredible, that was amazing!  @TeamUSA @usahockey #TeamUSA #USA #usawomenshockey

Take that, eh @KTBryski.   
480 2018-02-22 23:43:01 Shed the Gold, shed the characters, get angry, make an impact! Set your sites hit hard!
481 2018-02-22 23:42:58 Lol...for gold id make them play more overtime periods rather than a shootout
482 2018-02-22 23:42:58 I want a gold cross necklace
483 2018-02-22 23:42:56 Maybe because he was told not to enter, told not to interfere with the governments agenda. He resigns. Him and his family live a long happy rich life now, as gold muzzled lap dogs.
484 2018-02-22 23:42:55 Congrats to the woman’s hockey team for getting the gold! First time in two decades we got the gold. Good job girls!! #usawomenshockey #Gold #GoTeamUSA
485 2018-02-22 23:42:55 Honestly I hope this whole cryptocurrency thing goes down the tubes soon. Wasting energy, dragging up computer prices and whose it benefiting? Only those buying into the gold rush.

495 2018-02-22 23:42:34 USA full value for the win, that is not the way to settle gold in a shootout.
496 2018-02-22 23:42:32 Just watched the ending of the women’s gold medal match in hockey.

Hockey >>>>>>>> soccer.

Don’t @ me
497 2018-02-22 23:42:30 #JocelyneLarocque is a joke. It should be an honour to play for team Canada and even more to get a gold medal game. Lets not at like an ungrateful spoilt brat
498 2018-02-22 23:42:26 @minliangtan @Razer how about a Black Panther themed keyboard? Headset? Mouse? Black and gold or black and silver?

501 2018-02-22 23:42:21 if you're writing yuri on ice fic and you change the ending of the series so yuuri takes the gold over yuri just know that i hate you, personally
502 2018-02-22 23:42:20 Just watched the replay of USA women’s hockey gold medal game. Even though I knew how it ended, I still got chills! 
503 2018-02-22 23:42:18 Just saw the replay of the US Women's hockey gold medal win vs Canada. Wow. Our women > the world's women combined! #USA
504 2018-02-22 23:42:17 If @TeamShuster wins the Gold Medal, I'm moving to Duluth to celebrate!

519 2018-02-22 23:41:56 Arkansas State 37, App State 22 | 2:04 2Q

App trying to get a spurt going before the break. Four quick points from the Black and Gold has cut the lead down to 15.
520 2018-02-22 23:41:56 Strength of rand squeezing margins and AISC generally too high - needs marked increase in gold price to induce sustained rise-much better gold smallcap plays are #aaz and #krs (latter trades at substantial discount to value of its holding in asx:cai
521 2018-02-22 23:41:55 But she’s the only way I can climb out of gold
522 2018-02-22 23:41:54 I keep hearing -"wins gold, in PF Chang's."

524 2018-02-22 23:41:50 Twitter is 50/50. You get some moments of absolute comedy gold: brilliant puns, witty humour, feel good stories etc.

But then you get a tidal wave of Americans preaching to give teachers guns. Like, how can you be that stupid?
525 2018-02-22 23:41:47 United States gets gold in hockey,,,!,!
526 2018-02-22 23:41:47 Women's ice hockey @Olympics ... wow! Gold!!!

530 2018-02-22 23:41:37 My favorite part of last night, other than winning gold, was probably seeing Rooney after she made that last save just bat the puck away from the crease before she celebrated like NO NOPE YOU CAN'T GO IN GOODBYE
531 2018-02-22 23:41:35 FYI: Red is no longer in the color scheme. That was from USL days. It’s gold now.
532 2018-02-22 23:41:33 But how we gonna find your latest podcast gold?

540 2018-02-22 23:41:22 @EpicGames There is a weird glitch on Xbox with Fortnite. Just got a gold scar, was picking up ammo, picked up a revolver accidentally. Went to pick up the scar, it disappeared when I did, and glitched the slot, only letting me hold 4 items

552 2018-02-22 23:40:56 #bbcqt I want a factometer at the bottom of the screen which verifies claims made by all panel members. I want all claims verified within minutes. Gauge should run from utter bollocks through to gold plate truth.
553 2018-02-22 23:40:55 Spot on. Teaching kids to think for themselves is the gold standard for education. The rest is a bonus.
554 2018-02-22 23:40:53 Agree! We give to many ribbons, trophies and medals for simply playing a sport. This sportsman wanted the GOLD, and nothing else was going to fix it. #MadProps
555 2018-02-22 23:40:40 Megan vs. Brandi Glanville or Tamra would’ve been GOLD.
556 2018-02-22 23:40:40 shouts to the women’s USA Hockey Team  for their win against #Canada last night to break their 4 gold run  sudden death shootout

560 2018-02-22 23:40:25 under the jorts is a heart of gold also wearing jorts
561 2018-02-22 23:40:21 Knew it all along, still yelled and chanted. #helluvajob ladies! @usahockey #PyongChang2018 #gold #TeamUSAWomensHockey #teamusa
562 2018-02-22 23:40:20 Its only for a gold medal game. But yeah, it's annoying.

Look at what the NHL just did 2 years ago by having a 3v3 five minute OT; it's a huge success. But the fact that the OT format in the playoffs is still any number of 20 minute periods of 5v5 until a goal is unbearable
563 2018-02-22 23:40:19 I hope the USA wins gold in men’s curling. To celebrate let’s buy them uniforms that don’t make them look like part-time golfers.

567 2018-02-22 23:40:16 This tweet is gold. 
568 2018-02-22 23:40:14 If the new upgraded gold card is the same rating or higher rated than his first inform then his inform cards will be upgraded

572 2018-02-22 23:40:09 All these newbs watching the gold medal replay just now smh
573 2018-02-22 23:40:02 If tweeting was an Olympic sport you just won the gold son
574 2018-02-22 23:40:01 Everyone complaining about this doesn’t realize you have to loose for a Silver. You win Gold  and you win Bronze...
575 2018-02-22 23:39:59 People never think a shoot-out should decide a gold medal game.....unless their team wins. LOL
576 2018-02-22 23:39:58 Your tweet may turn out to be true, only time will tell...but USA has won 8 of the last 10 IIHF World Championships (last 4 straight) over Canada, so although it may have been 20 years between Olympic Gold Medals, it's certainly not because Canada was by far the dominant team
577 2018-02-22 23:39:55 Sanirim Kimse Bilmez le sezen aksunun kutlamasi arasinda yine sezen araya gidemem le girmis gibi ama bi yandan 70ler old but gold yelpaze genis
578 2018-02-22 23:39:51 I already know the outcome, but the replay of this gold medal women's game is insane.
579 2018-02-22 23:39:41 Oscar De La Hoya is known as boxing's “Golden Boy.” He won a gold medal for the United States in 1992.
580 2018-02-22 23:39:41 Aren’t we in the gold medal match?
581 2018-02-22 23:39:41 The deagles are gold so that’s super rare but tbh man I haven’t even been hit by a deagle bullet
582 2018-02-22 23:39:35 And as I previously mentioned, Olympic gold medal games should not end in shootout. Play should continue in overtime until fairly won by a team effort, not placing all the pressure on 1 player.
583 2018-02-22 23:39:34 @guardian need more gold sleeves in our routine chaps. Otherwise, were top of the pops.
584 2018-02-22 23:39:32 I know I’m not. My Grandfather & Great uncle-God Rest their souls fought on Iwo Jima together & they never spoke once about it. They were successful in life however you always could tell they held back something. They both were men of few words.
585 2018-02-22 23:39:30 おはよーございます。
586 2018-02-22 23:39:29 Shooty things 
587 2018-02-22 23:39:16 The #TeamUSA Womens Gold Medal while fantastic will always be 2nd. The Miracle on Ice was about beating the Rompin Stompin Russian Red Army Ass it was a different world.
588 2018-02-22 23:39:15 Doesn’t quite roll off the tongue as nicely, but it does feature a 303, so I wouldn’t be 100% bad. Calling him Nar for short would be a laugh. 
589 2018-02-22 23:39:14 Your a spectator no one should  care ,your over seas having a good time while watching your wife going for the gold......stay thirsty my friend.

592 2018-02-22 23:39:06 ATTI: #ML06Gold H Bus 156 on the Gold Line H is at Mon General:2/22/2018 6:38:57 PM Next stop Ruby to Dwntwn.
593 2018-02-22 23:39:05 Hearing what some people wear to work is very concerning. Learning what our image communicates in the workplace to others is gold. #professionaldevelopment #personalbrand #Workwear #Tamworth #NewcastleJobs #Sydney
594 2018-02-22 23:39:02 I’m rewatching the gold medal game. Man what a shot by Kessel in the shootout.
595 2018-02-22 23:39:01 A medal at the fucking Olympics is still a medal , you moron. Whether it’s silver , bronze or gold it’s still one medal that you and your loser ilk will never have .
596 2018-02-22 23:39:00 An update from last night's stream. Apparently, 4-6 is basically gold? *shrug* I got no frigging clue my dudes. #overwatch #matchmaking #carriedcarrying #mathishard
597 2018-02-22 23:38:54 Anybody who's willing to struggle, I think, can write. The real work is to stick at it until you find the gold.~T. Rossario
598 2018-02-22 23:38:53 If that garbage can is actually made of gold and filled with kindness and positivity, then this is accurate
599 2018-02-22 23:38:53 @FortniteGame When are y’all gonna release a Xbox Live Gold exclusive skin like you guys did with PSPlus
600 2018-02-22 23:38:50 Liberal media, liberal hate mongers. They criticize @POTUS for congratulating the USA Woman's Ice Hockey team for winning gold! That is how petty & full of hate they are.
601 2018-02-22 23:38:49 im the gold condom
602 2018-02-22 23:38:49 once nixon took the US
off of the gold standard for currency
they were finished with him....
603 2018-02-22 23:38:44 Mind racing like Michael Johnson in gold shoes
The fly Nike tracksuit too, what am I chasing?
604 2018-02-22 23:38:43 Men's Big air final tonight!! We've got Canadians in the mix... Seb Touts, Marc McMorris and Max Parrott. I smell a Gold medal... #OlympicGames2018 #canadiansdoitbetter
605 2018-02-22 23:38:39 Gold for the @usahockey women last night. And a shining example that equal & fair compensation - regardless of gender, skin color, sexual orientation - leads to better results. #EqualPay #EqualityForAll #Olympics2018 #FightOn
606 2018-02-22 23:38:35 
607 2018-02-22 23:38:32 no, I sold you a gf in RuneScape for that gold, just gimme time to find hi— her.
608 2018-02-22 23:38:30 I see the resemblance nice!!  GOLD for Sure I'm seeing Double. 
609 2018-02-22 23:38:27 I told buckets of people that the women’s hockey was the sport to watch in this Olympics but I’ll never forgive myself for staying up through 16 minutes of OT, nodding off and waking up to see the girls wearing gold.
610 2018-02-22 23:38:24 assistindo titanic pela milésima vez, old but gold
611 2018-02-22 23:38:24 Even though I feel asleep half way through the second period, and I heard the outcome of the game this morning, getting to see the re-airing of the Gold medal game to see what I missed....So exciting to watch! Bit of a nail biter!

613 2018-02-22 23:38:20 hey @youtubetv can you give @lafc the O.K. to make the logo gold? more people will buy it and you'll get more exposure. thanks.
614 2018-02-22 23:38:17 How about you add Jennifer Morrison instead? The real star and lead of the show? It's a Once farewell tour, right? So why not adding the main lead of it fans want to see? You sold so many gold passes all these cons cause ppl wanted to see the legendary Jen/Colin duo panels.
615 2018-02-22 23:38:09 Congrats to the Women's Olympic Hockey Team. GOLD! GOLD! GOLD!
616 2018-02-22 23:38:07 When you're a hockey fan, #shootout stress is shootout stress. Doesn't matter that this is the #USA women's gold game on replay and I know we come out on top...heart's still racing.  #goldmedalgame

622 2018-02-22 23:37:49 Hasn't Cue Card done enough for owner and trainer? Why put him through another Gold Cup at his age. Disgusting

625 2018-02-22 23:37:40 Exactly  it’s suppose to be like the new rose gold or some shit 
626 2018-02-22 23:37:34 The volume of feathers and an equal volume of gold, are easily shown to have differing mass and density. A child in elementary school could devise the experiment. Big Bang on the other hand is a theory regarding the origins of the universe based on observable phenomena 1/g
627 2018-02-22 23:37:33 Nah, a panther stalks. The gold is way too flashy.
628 2018-02-22 23:37:33 Which did you drop into the lake? The Gold Ritter Jackknife? The silver Jackknife?
629 2018-02-22 23:37:32 I am a world class Olympic gold medalist in the sport of tipping the cup too high and spilling my drink all over myself
630 2018-02-22 23:37:27 Boy we're gold like the ring on your finger 24k
631 2018-02-22 23:37:27 I have that exact same votive, but in red & gold.

I also have that tea.
632 2018-02-22 23:37:26 Pea brain: reboots entire DCEU because of JL
Normal brain: uses Flash's first solo as Flashpoint to retcon the DCEU
Galaxy brain: develops a good Flash solo film with Rogues or Gorilla Grodd first, and keeps open the possibility of a Blue and Gold film to retcon mistakes later.
633 2018-02-22 23:37:24 Watching this shootout is far less stressful the second time around! #TeamUSA #womenshockey #Gold #USAvsCAN
634 2018-02-22 23:37:20 That video is pure gold
635 2018-02-22 23:37:16 Watching a replay of the Women's gold medal hockey game on NBCSN. It's great to see the US win gold, but why are we deciding this with a shootout? Such a lame and gimmicky way to decide the winner. Should be sudden death.
636 2018-02-22 23:37:12 FFA Week 2018 is almost over! See you in your official dress or Blue and Gold to celebrate with us! Keep sharing your pics! #ffaweek #FFAWearBlueDay #FFAweek18 #lchsag
637 2018-02-22 23:37:11 That would be me tho tbh. Fuck Silver hun, I’m the best I want Gold
638 2018-02-22 23:37:03 Dana Loesch 2/21: “I’m sorry for your loss” to a crying white mother at #CNNTownHall 

Dana Loesch 2/22: “crying white mothers are ratings gold” at #CPAC2018 

I smelled the sulphur when she was at the CNN Town Hall, Dana Loesch is even more vile than Anne Coulter

642 2018-02-22 23:36:54 There playing for gold why should she have to wear it anyways? That’s a rule?? How about the guy threw his silver medal into the stands and gave it away at the world Juniors this year ?? I for one think it’s should be players choice not someone who just comments
643 2018-02-22 23:36:54 SKYWALKER OG and POTS OF GOLD are now $7 a gram and $23 an eighth!!!! (after tax) #RKOPDX #RKO420 #STILLBLAZIN

648 2018-02-22 23:36:35 Which policy are u talking about and don't quote refugees because this is just one thing Whitlam would not of encountered ..but he would be no friend of people smugglers
649 2018-02-22 23:36:35 i am never going to refer to him to anything else other than governor gatling gun. that is gold 
650 2018-02-22 23:36:30 A @benshapiro v. Tariq Nasheed debate would be ratings gold.
651 2018-02-22 23:36:30 Our HBR X-Games gold medalists! 
652 2018-02-22 23:36:27 holy shit i found youtube gold

655 2018-02-22 23:36:19 Well thanks, I wasn't sure what film to watch this weekend...he'll be one of them haha
656 2018-02-22 23:36:16 US Men are going to a gold medal match in Curling against Sweeden!?!? What!? Heck yes!! #teamUSA #curling #PyeongChang2018
657 2018-02-22 23:36:15  these takes are gold. I haven't seen Black Panther yet, hopefully this weekend. I'm convinced the writers want us to despise Kate's entire being lol she is so hard to feel empathic for.
658 2018-02-22 23:36:15 Billie dragging Kate for deciding who her kids date is gold. #Days
659 2018-02-22 23:36:13 There are days my balance is iffy with skates or curling shoes on so they are super's even if they don't bring home a gold. I'm back here in 'little league' while they are at the Olympics.
660 2018-02-22 23:36:12 True, oh well. The reality is its Alina's gold to lose...we will see if she earns it tonight.
661 2018-02-22 23:36:10 Absolute gold Francis
662 2018-02-22 23:36:06 that's too pedestrian.. If gold can be floating... why can't water?   or whatever liquid Aelves might live in...
663 2018-02-22 23:36:04 Well, state debt is really a tremendous problem. No doubt. But  fixing the money supply (like former gold standard) would definitely crack the economy. (Everybody hodl ;)
664 2018-02-22 23:35:54 ts les soirs jsuis encore sur twitter à 0h30 à chercher le sens de la vie+pk jsuis sur ce site aussi tard et presque à chaque fois jvois que @Gh0uI_ est aussi active...

j'ai envie de dire "qu'est-ce que tu fais là à cette heure??" tel une maman mais ça serait ironique voyez vous
665 2018-02-22 23:35:54 Ok maybe not the gold star but give him at least the red one HE Showed UP
666 2018-02-22 23:35:53 What’s that a-boot? Clearly, gold is her favourite colour.
667 2018-02-22 23:35:52 This is gold 
668 2018-02-22 23:35:51 It's for a chance to win Gold during a worldwide event that happens every 4 years... play your best players and especially the ones with the most speed when there is soooo much ice in OT! Teach that lesson some other time. SUM > PARTS #CoachingIsOverrated
669 2018-02-22 23:35:49 Respecting myself means never again falling for a gold digger.
670 2018-02-22 23:35:47 استغفر الله واتوب إليه .
671 2018-02-22 23:35:39 Nah. Those are all Canadians!!! Canada vs USA hockey is always great!! And usually is for a gold. Or has that feel regardless!! 
672 2018-02-22 23:35:39 Seriously?!  Ending the game on a PK.... still lost my .... #Congrats #USWomensHockey @usahockey #teamusa #gold 
673 2018-02-22 23:35:38 The best part, MRE's pretty damn good. Jalepeno cheese is better than gold.
674 2018-02-22 23:35:38 Let’s try that again... he’s in an upcoming film about the Entebbe crisis from years back..  looks interesting.  He was a Nazi with a heart of gold in ‘The Zookeeper’s Wife’.  He’s on a roll for sure.
675 2018-02-22 23:35:38 I’m thinking gold fingers lemon pepper wings 
676 2018-02-22 23:35:37 u're more than diamond, more than gold
677 2018-02-22 23:35:36 sometimes i sit and think about how 2017 skt managed to pull off so many things from their bag of tricks

like. winning telecom war with a gold deficit. and that reverse sweep in playoffs. and xD-ing and going 0-4 in the regular season post rift rivals.
678 2018-02-22 23:35:33 Nuff respect to @MikaelaShiffrin @chloekimsnow @shaunwhite and @lindseyvonn for cold doing their thing at the Winter Olympics with the gold medals and stuff. Salute to all of dem #Olympics
679 2018-02-22 23:35:29 What is insulting is acting like sex and blood aren’t ratings gold for the media. You know better.  You think ESPN lead off with highlights of last nights action when killer Aaron Hernandez hung himself  ?
680 2018-02-22 23:35:18 Leighton is my favorite LB in this class. I think he has the most tools and talent to become a solid starter. If he wasnt injuried in '16 i think he would be #1 LB
681 2018-02-22 23:35:16 New season high of 1829 :D So happy considering I started in bronze this season! We're doing so well and next season will be gold/plat!
682 2018-02-22 23:35:15 Sorry, how is it ratings gold? What does that even mean?
683 2018-02-22 23:35:14 The fact that women of this caliber exist in my home country makes me proud to have daughters. They don't play hockey but knowing women can be this good at anything makes them try harder at the things they do like. Be proud! Silver IS GOLD in Canada bc you are all the best women!
684 2018-02-22 23:35:12 Defending her 200IM crown @CBendzie will be bring the gold home to Huntington!!
685 2018-02-22 23:35:07 Actually I vote for Morris and Lawes, for winning Gold for curling mixed doubles. It can’t be Virtue and Moir as they brought in the flag
686 2018-02-22 23:35:06 Will from gold juice is the funniest and finest niggah I’ve ever seen 
687 2018-02-22 23:35:06 the gold brings out the warmth of his face

690 2018-02-22 23:35:00 showing some love to my Capricorns out there, y’all don’t get enough credit. sometimes you can be cold as fuck but under it all there is a heart of GOLD
691 2018-02-22 23:34:58 I remember my first cd record i bought, almost 36 years old: Simple Minds - New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84) , still plays like a charm, no damaged layers or even any scratches.
692 2018-02-22 23:34:56 Sure, I'm just questioning the methodology. If I sell a gold future, but don't have the gold, and then cash settle that is inflationary and the volume has gone up, if I do the same thing but phyz settle it isn't inflationary.
693 2018-02-22 23:34:50 *gives you 10 gold bars*
694 2018-02-22 23:34:49 Zibao foi lá na escola, eu e Breno falamos pra ele tocar na nossa formatura, eu ouvi série Gold?KKKKKKKKKKKKK NÃO PARO DE RIR COM ISSO

715 2018-02-22 23:33:51 Why not just rename guns instead? They can trade with chinchillas or something. I mean who could possibly be scared when they're forced to run and hide in school due to a madman wielding a semi-automatic chinchilla? Sounds much better right?

726 2018-02-22 23:33:19 @Gold_Rush first smart move Todd ever did. Get out of mining. On top a good Christian would never gamble due to foolish pride. $100,000.00 Todd could have paid his crewn and himself went to Parker. A smart young miner. Good luck Todd. Every venture will end same till YOU CHANGE.
727 2018-02-22 23:33:19 I hope that it was worth when you’re searching and you find what glitters ain’t gold.
728 2018-02-22 23:33:16 You were amazing in the gold medal game. You should be proud.

734 2018-02-22 23:33:10 The very same pot of gold that the LNP have opposed from the start saying super is nothing but a con job! F.U!!!
735 2018-02-22 23:33:10 #RHdeeds My partner Chloe was leaving a department store and saw a homeless man sat outside asking for any change and clearly hungry. She went back inside and bought him a couple of days worth of food when we don't have much ourselves. She genuinely has a heart of gold
736 2018-02-22 23:33:10 Arrogance, oh you have the gold in that already.
737 2018-02-22 23:33:09 Today’s, 2/22, Intermediate Gold Baseball game against Mid-Pacific - which was to be played at MPI - has been postponed due to weather. No makeup date has been announced.
738 2018-02-22 23:33:05 Holy heck! That was epic! Congratulations #teamusa @usahockey #Olympics Champions #USA #usawomenshockey wins #womenshockey #gold in #PyeongChang2018 #USAvsCAN #CANvsUSA @NBCOlympics @Olympics @TeamUSA
739 2018-02-22 23:33:04 how about the overall medal count, the fact that my kid sister just got a heart transplant and DOESN'T have to worry about losing her house to pay for it (health care), the fact that BOTH our hockey teams are going to come away with medals and the GOLD medal count as well?
740 2018-02-22 23:33:00 Love Jackson...gotta see Leighton play more.  I haven't seen any of his film and probably only watched two or three boise games this year.
741 2018-02-22 23:32:57 Just watching the replay of the #USAvsCAN gold medal game and can't help but notice that this one game has had more action than the #Sabres entire season.
742 2018-02-22 23:32:56 came to the gold dust today and it brought back so many memories 
743 2018-02-22 23:32:56 Even knowing the end result, watching the women's ice hockey gold match is nerve-racking! #USAvsCAN #GoTeamUSA

745 2018-02-22 23:32:39 Had so much fun with the boys this morning at @NHL_Canes practice and getting autographs (thanks guys!). Couple that with a delayed watch of @usahockey 's win over Canada and my southern boys officially have hockey fever. #redvolution #Gold
746 2018-02-22 23:32:37 They all count the same right? Wouldn’t mind to see him (or anyone in Black/gold) score 16 empty nets in playoffs :)
747 2018-02-22 23:32:31 The hockey game lose really sucked but 4 straight years of winning gold is still a great record
748 2018-02-22 23:32:30 Last Nights #CAN v #USA marked the 9th #Gold medal/Championship game between the two Women's teams which had gone to #ExtraTime, That score is now 5 - 4.  DAMN YOU 'MURICA!! We'll get you next time.... #nexttime #GoCanadaGo #PyeongChang2018 #Olympics #a2dradio

752 2018-02-22 23:32:26 between you and me, the gold
753 2018-02-22 23:32:23 Should have added stars lol
754 2018-02-22 23:32:20 they’re replaying the gold medal game in the restaraunt & the minute I walked in & saw it on tv I said “hell yeah” & the waitress was unsettled

756 2018-02-22 23:32:11 pangarap ko lang naman sa buhay yung makapag bigti gamit gold chains.
757 2018-02-22 23:32:09 You were Canada’s MVP in the gold medal game
758 2018-02-22 23:32:05 @DevinScillian don’t let @berniesmilovitz give you a hard time! The shootouts should go! They’re thrilling but shouldn’t decide the Gold! But I’m happy we Won! USA!!!
759 2018-02-22 23:32:04 My heart is pure gold. I’m loving, caring and actually give a fuck but all people wanna do is try to play me and bring the bitch out of me and that’s okay cuz ima be nice to ppl who deserve it and cuss all you other muhfuckas out who keep tryna play me.
760 2018-02-22 23:32:02 If you stick with this shade of gold in the chrome, please have alternate maroon and white jerseys that use a matching gold shade. The yellow gold we have really clashes with the old fashioned gold in the chrome.
761 2018-02-22 23:32:00 Anyone ever try to fill in a sponsor logo with a gold sharpie before?

764 2018-02-22 23:31:50 Fabulous morning today with SIO course at Carrgate where  the students briefed me as Duty Gold! A top effort from the NYP DI! Was lovely to catch up with @MarkCatney who was almost having a little nap mid morning, after being up with Baby Rose!#NewDad 
765 2018-02-22 23:31:47 @PTI USA  Women’s hockey team beat arch rivals Canada  for the first time in 20 years to win Gold and you put it 3rd in the A-block after 2 NBA stories and lead with a whiny I don’t wanna play Kawhi Leonard? Who cares except in San Antonio? Bad, Bad programming 
766 2018-02-22 23:31:46 미치겟닼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
767 2018-02-22 23:31:45 Malik Jackson looks like bradham when he plays the run. 
Leighton vander esch looks like Sean Lee :)
768 2018-02-22 23:31:42 Congratulations to Our Women’s Hockey Team you played with great passion and you made us proud! Winning the Gold was a symbolic of your effort!!!

772 2018-02-22 23:31:28 so in bobsledding if there is a tie they both get gold but in Hockey if there is a tie they go with a shootout which isn't a great way to win or lose.  Why dont they both win gold?  #canadahockey #Olympics2018 #OlympicHockey
773 2018-02-22 23:31:27 Give them a gold medal.
774 2018-02-22 23:31:26 Congratulations @TeamShuster! @USAcurling going for the gold!

780 2018-02-22 23:31:15 Hawkey talk and hockey talk. 
It's such a great rivalry between the ladies and your gals played better than ours. 4X4 OT so boring on big ice. Rush down the wing and pass to... no one! Both teams. Shootout for Gold always wrong. But congrats!! It's your year.
781 2018-02-22 23:31:13 there is absolutely no reason to take off your silver OLYMPIC medal - losing the gold is disappointing but Canadians are not that ungrateful and it makes our country look bad
782 2018-02-22 23:31:10 Edmunds probably goes No further than GB at 14. Calvin goes No further than cowboys. But you never know who drops.

788 2018-02-22 23:30:58 Agree. This is part of the choice in making the decision to go, enjoying the experience etc. It has to be made clear to young people beforehand that there may not always be a pot of gold at the end of it all.....

793 2018-02-22 23:30:44 Wow this really is a news story that an athlete who just lost a Gold Medal game in one of the most heartbreaking ways imaginable took off her runner up medal. I for one admire the Woman.
794 2018-02-22 23:30:43 never forget that gold moment

797 2018-02-22 23:30:38 He can’t even make different color ways other then black and gold
798 2018-02-22 23:30:35 I’m thrilled that US women’s hockey won the gold... but should a gold medal really be decided by shootout? Seems to me like they should play as many OTs as it takes. I hope they change it for the next #WinterOlympics
799 2018-02-22 23:30:29 I love my new phone case so much!! It’s a rose gold case with the build in card holder!! I love having the built in card holder! I never have to carry my wallet which will be nice while traveling this summer!! Plus my cards are all I need since I never carry cash anyways!!

We need to offer degrees the country needs and businesses need to reassess if they truly need graduates just for filing work.
803 2018-02-22 23:30:21 hopefully the Nash can rub a couple of people's noses in it this coming Saturday chasing that pot of gold. Heart over Cash. Goodbye and good riddance.

807 2018-02-22 23:30:10 Imagine winning a gold medal
808 2018-02-22 23:30:05 Harve Presnell was a very famous singer back when I was a kid. Most of you will remember another famous role of his as General Marshall in "Saving Private Ryan," the General who reads the letter Abraham Lincoln wrote to the Gold Star Mother of five sons lost in the Civil War...
809 2018-02-22 23:30:00 Watching the #USA hockey gold medal replay and getting giddy even though i know what happens. Like the 109473639 times I’ve watched Bryant throw to Rizzo in Cleveland.

816 2018-02-22 23:29:43 You have to pick one (and deal with the consequences) - Gold Star or skyline?
817 2018-02-22 23:29:40 Yea black and gold theme 
818 2018-02-22 23:29:38 Definitely a fan of Malik Jefferson.  I think Edmunds and Ridley are long gone before we pick.  Kerryon Johnson is grossly underrated right now.  Williams or Brown would be nice value at 32 as well.  We're on the same page with the exception of Evans haha!
819 2018-02-22 23:29:38 And now I'm going to bond with my Midwestern brethren by watching the US men win gold in curling. Out of curiosity: How do midwesterners talk shit to Canada? Is that even a thing?
820 2018-02-22 23:29:29 I thought it was illegal to reorder transactions now. Also if you're with Chase apparently they're having some crazy caching errors. 

Fuck banks bury gold.
821 2018-02-22 23:29:25 My kid acted like that once at a wrestling tourny....Once! Never again 2nd is still a high place. Cld have been 4th. Put your big girl britches on and work harder to get gold. After that my son became a better wrestler and sportsman.

843 2018-02-22 23:28:22 Why tf does anyone care. She's not tossing it aside, it's raw emotion. Let her. And for the record, Olympic hockey for gold shouldn't end with a shootout. @ me.
844 2018-02-22 23:28:19 Good to meet you yesterday at The Stadium Stories event, thank you Mr Gold for signing my book  @davidgold
845 2018-02-22 23:28:17 Watched it in 1980 and was in awe of the US team. But how about the US Women's team gold medal win last night? It was pretty damn inspirational for these dark times. Their tenacity, skill, and class are something we can all celebrate.
846 2018-02-22 23:28:11 The ALP keeps trying to prove they’re better than the LNP as economic managers. They are but they adopted LNP politics to prove that. Whitlam was a great PM but was too socially progressive. If he was leader today with all the corruption exposed I think he’d have an easier time.
847 2018-02-22 23:28:09 Gold for the win 
848 2018-02-22 23:28:08 I'm pissed I looked cause of this

851 2018-02-22 23:27:53 Yeah the us women deserved to win they played a great gold medal game.  With that said did you enjoy losing the previous 4 and salt lake in your own country, Vancouver, and Sochi .... oh wait you didn’t make the gold medal game in Sochi
852 2018-02-22 23:27:52 yes let’s do it!
853 2018-02-22 23:27:50 So we all agree that this gold medal game is going to become a 30 for 30  soon, right? #USAvsCAN #Gold #WinterOlympics2018

871 2018-02-22 23:26:55 As a Canadian, I have no problem that the USA won gold. They won ... they deserve it. Worthy opponents. Still VERY proud of the Canadian woman’s team. . And forgive Larocque (a proud warrior) for her momentary lapse in judgment.
872 2018-02-22 23:26:53 So can you explain to me how someone can win a gold or bronze, but not a silver?. I’m confused!..

874 2018-02-22 23:26:50 @hotted89 @Asmongold @RichWCampbell @TradeChat Saw Allcraft 30. I was intrigued regarding your views on professions and gold. Y'all might ask @GumdropsEU about goblin-ing, professions and shuffles. r/woweconomy has made me tons and tons of gold with professions.

877 2018-02-22 23:26:39 I have been watching @TeamShuster curl for a quite a few years now but at no time did I figure they were a Gold Medal threat. I’m wrong again congrats to them
878 2018-02-22 23:26:28 Anyone willing to give me a good carry I will give u a £10 or $10 xbox code ?   (Only once we have the win). Also if we get lots of wins I have a gold 3 month membership u can have
879 2018-02-22 23:26:27 Didn't it take a few days to win gold in Vancouver? Likely all felt worse than this.

893 2018-02-22 23:25:40 Cause I watch these types of shows and am like "wtf is this and why do people love it so much" but what they love are the few pieces of gold that make it through.

I'm more on the "most are bad, many are mediocre, and a few are pretty good" line of things, but I get it.
894 2018-02-22 23:25:34 Melted down under him. It was total disater. He sold tons of our gold at £240 an ounce and after he left it soared up five fold.
895 2018-02-22 23:25:28 I only go to Starbucks for about a month out of the year but during that month I spend enough money to keep my gold status

Although I don't play comp, I can see how important it is to have skill in multiple roles. Then again people naturally gravitate to certain
909 2018-02-22 23:24:57 What i'll miss most about the #WinterOlympics? The guts, skill and technical prowess of #ShortTrack - but mostly @Elise_Christie's determination, @ShaolinLiu's eyebrows and pre-race wink, and the BBC's coverage of their love story

918 2018-02-22 23:24:39 Why don't we just have a competition for every competitor,  then everyone can have the glory of winning a gold...
919 2018-02-22 23:24:36 Everyone is talking crap about Jocelyne Larocque when A: I highly doubt any of the people judging her have been in that position, and B: have obviously forgotten the USA’s poor reactions throughout the years when they have lost gold (queue Haley Wickenheiser’s 2002 speech)
920 2018-02-22 23:24:24 These quotes border on silly. He seems to have "discovered" the fraud of political economics. Is this supposed to mean something? Central bank "target" of bitcoin is as nonsensical as their targeting of gold.

928 2018-02-22 23:23:55 Hate to tell you but no Canadian will ever take advice from an American especially about hockey. Did you even watch the game? I feel sorry for the American ladies since they'll need to melt down their gold for their indebtedness to the refs. It was pathetic.
929 2018-02-22 23:23:55 Watching the recap of the Canada vs USA women’s gold medal hockey match. There has been a greater emphasis on women’s hockey this year than previous years. Good matches too, like this one.
930 2018-02-22 23:23:55 To celebrate last night's gold medal,  I wore my 2011-WJC-version of the 1960 @usahockey white sweater in lieu of a jacket today.
931 2018-02-22 23:23:48 I’m still proud of our women’s team, because we all know Canadian women are caring warriors, and we let others share in the Olympic gold once every 20 years. Our next run starts now!
932 2018-02-22 23:23:45 Gold.
933 2018-02-22 23:23:44 Fun fact, this day in history team Russia men's hockey would've been the 1st team to win gold 5 Olympics in a row only to be  stopped by USA 1980,  team Canada women's hockey could've won their 5th in a row, stopped by USA women's hockey Thank you ladies!
934 2018-02-22 23:23:42 Wasn't very Beta of you to win gold @FeitsBarstool

942 2018-02-22 23:23:21 Never much watch hockey, but up late last night and couldn't take my eyes off the US Womens Hockey match for the gold! Far better than any Superbowl! Best game ever!! Huge Congratulations to th US Ladies! Way to represent!

947 2018-02-22 23:23:11 Actually you do win the Silver medal by winning your semi-final game.  That wins you that medal.  Winning the Championship game wins you the Gold.  You just get awarded it after the Finals.

949 2018-02-22 23:23:05 I have similar notes--but his negatives come mostly from the pass rush standpoint.  I don't really care about that because for us we need him to be in the Bradham mold of LB.  His coverage skills and instincts are what peak my interest.  I'd love it at 32.

1006 2018-02-22 23:20:34 I'm not a bit slighted or upset she took of th medal. She wanted gold. They expected gold. They worked hard for gold.  To her, she didn't win silver, she lost gold. And she was pissed about it. It's an emotional ride. Everyone should lay off
1007 2018-02-22 23:20:32 @DLoesch  you are a disgusting person. Last night you were so sympathetic You couldn’t imagine the parents pain. Today at CPAC you said “WHITE MOTHERS TEARS ARE RATINGS GOLD” Why didn’t you say that to the parents & young people last night? Despicable and disgusting SHAME ON YOU
1008 2018-02-22 23:20:30 (broken clock theory)  Of course crying women (preferably young girls) is ratings gold.  Barbra Walters built a career on close-ups of crying interviews.  Screaming tweens is also ratings gold.  It's the most common sound effect for any game show.  Crying girl on every front page
1009 2018-02-22 23:20:25 I am not a parent. 

That said, all of my students are “my kids”… and I would give them the shiniest gold star AND the scratch and sniff sticker of their choice… but if it wasn’t “Grape job!”, I would be disappointed.

1020 2018-02-22 23:19:47 I believe they like profits but would rather profit off of other news. Trump has been gold to them for two years.

1026 2018-02-22 23:19:39 Rewatching last night's gold medal game and one observation I made, Kenny Albert called a really solid game. I'm usually pretty critical of Albert but he was one point last night given the moment.
1027 2018-02-22 23:19:38 Okidoki hive mind, need recommendations! Long short #stories (I know) that take about 40-60 minutes to #read aloud. Appropriate for ages 11-15. Interesting and engaging with lots of little short cliffhangers. (This is for #WorldBookDay.) Who can help me out?

1032 2018-02-22 23:19:25 Serious question:, what are your thoughts about adding a small exposure to bitcoin in GTAA strategy? Low correlation and finite supply make it similar to gold in some respects

1067 2018-02-22 23:18:27 Congrats - our two nations put on quite a show of hockey - even though mine did not take home the gold, getting to watch that hockey was worth it!

1084 2018-02-22 23:17:56 My daughter plays hockey and says there’s a huge difference between playing for bronze than gold. You want that bronze medal. But for gold, nobody wants the silver. Must be gracious always even in loss and set example for young players watching.
1085 2018-02-22 23:17:55 I don’t think they’ve used red since the USL days but I’d like to see some gold. The monochrome alternate badges are over done

1124 2018-02-22 23:16:19 “Crying white mothers are ratings gold.” Dana Loesch, NRA spokesperson. Are you f-ing kidding me???? Wonder how much she’d cry if someone massacred her kids??? Pathetic

1140 2018-02-22 23:15:46 Genuinely more excited for USA in gold medal curling match than I’d be if the men’s hockey team was playing for gold.
1141 2018-02-22 23:15:42 Just watched gold medal game for women's ice hockey. Looked like a men's high school game. I'm sorry, it's what it looked like. Congrats to Team USA.
1142 2018-02-22 23:15:41 Correct.
I was just thinking how sad it is that Mrs. Sanders is berated for simply congratulating the USA womens hockey team for winning the gold medal & expressing her excitement to attend the games, too.
I don’t understand this kind of hatred. It makes zero sense to me.
1143 2018-02-22 23:15:40 Saturday 1:35 AM who wants to watch USA win their first Gold in Curling!!!!!
1144 2018-02-22 23:15:40 In this state it is illegal to let your llamas grave on public land. They also have mines for super, gold, and uranium.
1145 2018-02-22 23:15:37 What good is a heart of gold with nobody to share it? 
1146 2018-02-22 23:15:37 That's NOT what she said.  “Many in legacy media love mass shootings. You guys love it,”  “I’m not saying you guys love the tragedy but I am saying you love the   ratings,” she added. “Crying white mothers are ratings gold”
1147 2018-02-22 23:15:34 on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold

1153 2018-02-22 23:15:19 Your men’s team is probably gonna take gold anyways
1154 2018-02-22 23:15:18 You are an awesome goalie and a wonderful representative of our great country. Congrats on winning the silver. I know you guys would have preferred gold but be proud it could easily have gone the other way.
1155 2018-02-22 23:15:18 NRA denounces “elites.” Ignores the fact that the GOP standard bearer has gold toilets.
1156 2018-02-22 23:15:14 According to NRA spokeswoman “ a crying white mother is ratings gold”, so what is a colored one? Bronze? I know you would be Platinum, encrusted in diamonds. In history, it was written Billy Kid killed 21 men by age of 16, not counting Indians, Mexican and N****. Have we changed?
1157 2018-02-22 23:15:13 You are going to make machines take the rest of the jobs. People don't seem to understand business. I don't mind... I am one of the ones building those machines. I bet Bernie has some investments in automation.  

Like Ron Paul and gold. #RonPaul.

1161 2018-02-22 23:14:53 Why not booster gold
1162 2018-02-22 23:14:51 @CNN glorifies the tragedy everytime this happens. Grieving white mothers is ratings gold. They have NO shame! No townhalls in Chicago or sanctuary cities! No townhalls for gang violence or violence from illegals! They feed on white children getting killed & they Love it! #shame
1163 2018-02-22 23:14:51 is your bread made out of fucking gold?

1167 2018-02-22 23:14:46 You are a priceless commodity.  Far more valuable than gold to the children of this country and the moms who love them.

1169 2018-02-22 23:14:39 She took off her hat. That was some A+ hat-removing. Just like that. Amazing. Gold medal. Chiharu Kobayashi won the hat olympics.
1170 2018-02-22 23:14:35 Nah, very Canadian. The Americans were the ones getting gold medals around their necks.
1171 2018-02-22 23:14:34 Watching #TeamUSAwomensHockey gold medal game. I know the results and this OT is still stressing me out! #LoveHockey

Only shooting stars

1176 2018-02-22 23:14:28 Because the Olympics recognizes the top 3 in a sport and unfortunately that's the only way to do it. If it was just a single champion, that's one thing, but the Olympics are all about Bronze, Silver, and Gold.

1187 2018-02-22 23:14:00 Weird to think when I played hockey for Farmington and there was a girl on my team, that she would end up a gold medalist for team USA

1191 2018-02-22 23:13:44 It was a great game, BUT, a gold metal game shouldn’t be decided with a shootout!  Proud of the ladies none the less! 
1192 2018-02-22 23:13:42 Watching the Women's Gold Medal match!
1193 2018-02-22 23:13:42 Sure. I can't tell you what position Wayne Gretzky played, and I still don't get why you use trimesters instead of quarters.

All I know is that this gold medal is one step closer to total Canadian annexation.
1194 2018-02-22 23:13:42 Like gold? You'll love hands!
1195 2018-02-22 23:13:36 No,no. These women are not ‘girls.’ They fought hard for gender equality and won it. We noticed a shift in their power & confidence the minute they were treated as women instead of girls. We predicted they’d win gold in 2018 #usawomanshockey
1196 2018-02-22 23:13:34 Going to class hungover is something that should be awarded with a gold medal

1201 2018-02-22 23:13:26 Why didn't you say these ugly things last night when you were with those students? “Many in legacy media love mass shootings. You guys love it,” 
  “I’m not saying you guys love the tragedy but I am saying you love the  ratings,” she added. “Crying white mothers are ratings gold”

1209 2018-02-22 23:13:05 I watched the entire game. It was awesome. I would like to have seen us win the Gold medal for the 5th time in a row.

1210 2018-02-22 23:13:02 i mean like i’d also love it if my automatic reaction to too much of any emotion wasn’t crying but. you know.

1216 2018-02-22 23:12:53 A shoot out is no way to determine a gold medal game
1217 2018-02-22 23:12:49 Thank you so much!! yeah from what i could tell it seems very muted/sophisticated gold than like i guess what a tacky gold would be, ive done the glitter its VERY glittery haha im probably looking for something in between.

1225 2018-02-22 23:12:29 It can add more of a WOW factor to bump her PCS. She would need every point possible if Zagitova hits. My point is why not go for it if gold is pretty much out of reach?
1226 2018-02-22 23:12:29 I agree with you I’m gold star and I go up against plat III and II’s but then my teammates are below my rank like what?
1227 2018-02-22 23:12:23 A little levity, something to counteract all that Wheeler love out there. Here's the #NHLJets captain on the CAN-US women's gold-medal hockey game: "Kind of a bummer that is has to go to a shootout to decide such an important thing. But happy the good guys won."
1228 2018-02-22 23:12:22 WHite gold ... more like white stuff up the nose what could possibly go wrong with relying on selling via  3 parties in china ... another bullshit stock how bellamys  still exists is beyond me ... every time a problem with these stocks roll out the two child story to pump
1229 2018-02-22 23:12:22 You can't arrest crazy. Take for example your crazy comments about people bum rushing the stage to harm you. Should you be arrested for your delusional, self-serving commentary. You appeared to support mothers who lost their children and used this moment for NRA ratings gold.

1239 2018-02-22 23:11:48 Interesting to see our multi-factor multi-asset strategies shifting meaningfully toward inflation oriented assets, ie commodities, gold, TIPs, EAFE. Could be short lived, but definitely observing a state change.
1240 2018-02-22 23:11:45 My daughter woke up at 145 last night so I got to watch the last 8 mins of the overtime and shootout of the women’s gold medal. Obviously I wanted Canada to win but once it went to shootout I didn’t mind with either team winning.

1245 2018-02-22 23:11:27 @TeamUSA first you take away the 20 year hold on the women's hockey gold medal from Canada, then you exacerbated it by taking away the men's curling gold as well. As an American living in Canada I'm afraid to cross over to get home tonight.
1246 2018-02-22 23:11:25 Best thing I read today from @YahooSports about the gold medal hockey game last night. “Twitter took to the streets with the wrath of a million Philadelphians” everyone knows exactly what they meant.  #USAvsCAN #PeyongChang2018 #proudtobefromphillysuburbs
1247 2018-02-22 23:11:24 @NRA should help deny ratings gold to @CNN and other media they hate by joining @GabbyGiffords and others to force passing laws that regulate, license, and insure guns the way cars are, thus denying @CNN mass shootings ratings gold. Also save some lives.

Grieving white students of mothers is ratings gold 4 u & that is sad! U glorify the tragedy
1261 2018-02-22 23:10:55 I hope you don't end up in that list of great wrestlers that should have won the world title. Big Gold would have looked amazing on you.

1274 2018-02-22 23:10:26 He is a joke. While he singlemindedly pursues a self-awarded Gold Medal for narcissistic photo ops, there is not one critical policy success he can point to.  He was born on third base and likes to pretend he hit a triple.

1281 2018-02-22 23:09:58 This is always a tricky one. We often find that parents go for ABA because they do not understand their child's behaviours and autism. Then combine this with the powerful ABA rhetoric:"windows of opportunity", "gold-standard", "supported by 30 yrs of research", "new ABA".
1282 2018-02-22 23:09:56 I recorded gold medal women hockey match, and now it is replay on NBCSN. I couldn’t find at first tv stream becaue it showed my what I recorded. Maybe not big difference but I would  like to see what is on TV and what is not.

1290 2018-02-22 23:09:24 clearly black and gold for ALPHA PHI ALPHA!!!
1291 2018-02-22 23:09:21 Right! Me either!! A moment I will also never forget. Another Olympic one happened 4 years later in L.A. when @marylouretton did her amazing vault for all-around gold in gymnastics. Us being the same age, she was a great role model.
1292 2018-02-22 23:09:16 So true.. I dont bother these days... If I get gold monthly's I'm grateful. The game is just full of pace merchants who cant do shit without a credit card
1293 2018-02-22 23:09:15 this is pure gold.
Maybe my favorite @byrnes22 video yet? That's tough competition too.... #Legend

1306 2018-02-22 23:08:52 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) of the @NRA asserts that "many in legacy media love mass shootings" because "crying white mothers are ratings gold."

Did she sell her soul or was she merely born without one?

1308 2018-02-22 23:08:48 WOW at least I have a heart of gold 
1309 2018-02-22 23:08:48 Canada is so mad that the USA took away gold in Hockey AND Curling rn.  It's like a CFL team winning the Super Bowl. #nooocanada #womenshockey #curling usa
1310 2018-02-22 23:08:46 Nope don't like them ever. Former goalie mom HATES the idea of an individual talent show deciding any kind of game (peewee minor hockey OR Olympic gold).  Don't get me wrong I am still happy when Canada wins via shootout but it doesn't mean I like the format.
1311 2018-02-22 23:08:38 Except they aren’t gold plated anymore except for the millionaires
1312 2018-02-22 23:08:37 Every single thing that Ja’mie says is fucking gold, I’m so weak

1314 2018-02-22 23:08:31 She didn't win the silver medal - she lost the gold medal. She's a competitor and isn't satisfied with a consolation prize. I have no problem with that.

1321 2018-02-22 23:08:13 @975TheFanatic @devong975 The US Women's Hockey Team won a gold medal for the first time in 20 yrs yesterday; one of the most exciting hockey gms I've seen. But nooo, there was no sports on last night.
1322 2018-02-22 23:08:10 Amen!  If you’re holding long term winners, who cares about what’s happening Day-to-day, month-to-month.  Cycles will happen.  Hold those bags of gold.

1327 2018-02-22 23:07:53 Yikes - winners, losers, and real losers.  I understand disappointment, but have some dignity, or at least show some for your opponents.  If you are willing to hold your head high wearing Gold, you should be ready to hold it together when you are bested.

1332 2018-02-22 23:07:43 I JUST REALIZED THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF MASSOT & SAVCHENKO'S GOLD MEDAL WINNING PROGRAM THEIR ARMS FORM AN INFINITY SIGN. I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER BE EMOTIONALLY OK EVER AGAIN. THIS HAS BEEN A PSA.
1333 2018-02-22 23:07:41 I agree - it was pure gold. @MaxineAlderton is a genius and I thought @DannyBMiller’s delivery was superb. Him and Ryan were incredible  #Robron

1341 2018-02-22 23:07:25 Agreed. Those students, parents, friends, brothers, sisters, and teachers are entitled to react any way they want. They should be shown the same respect that Gold Star Parents are (well, at least before the media attacked General Kelly), and we should know better.

1344 2018-02-22 23:07:21 Sitting here with the biggest smile on my face in my @mduggan10 jersey as I watch the replay of last night's gold medal game. This win is going to keep me happy for so long.
1345 2018-02-22 23:07:20 Plus, she has a gold from Sochi...very poor behavior
1346 2018-02-22 23:07:16 Enjoyed #EastEnders “It’s Stockport syndrome...” & “Welsh gold, from Ben Nevis!”
1347 2018-02-22 23:07:14 what makes it even better is knowing it's for the Gold
1348 2018-02-22 23:07:13 Yes hand cuffs would be great! It would be funny if they spray painted them gold.
1349 2018-02-22 23:07:11 @DLoesch U r an absolute piece of trash of a human being for the things u said about mass shootings being loved by certain outlets and “crying white mothers” being ratings gold. The heartlessness with what u said is deplorable and inexcusable. I don’t know how u sleep at night.
1350 2018-02-22 23:07:10 They ignored EVERYTHING questionable about him because they actually believed he was going to give them that unicorn that craps gold nuggets.
1351 2018-02-22 23:07:05 Well, yeah, of course I'd have eyes like this too. The Lord was that fond of gold, y'know?
1352 2018-02-22 23:07:03 Ahhhhh I remember bawling my eyes out over that gold! Such an iconic moment! A lot of the backlash is younger fans tbh and I really don't understand it at all.

1365 2018-02-22 23:06:36 EXACTLY my point! People automatically think just because I am saying Obama did great in his tenure and gave Trump a gold mine -- that I am saying Trump is doing bad. It's just simply too soon to give Trump any credit. It's been one year and he's hardly passed much.

1368 2018-02-22 23:06:23 Words cannot describe how I feel about this album, all I know is that I have eaten every inch of these tracks! This album is gold!
1369 2018-02-22 23:06:22 Olympic Hockey. I’m Canadian and I will say the USA was the better team. But just about the poor sport comment. 16 years ago when they met for gold it was the USA team the put the Canadian flag on the floor in their locker room and stomped on it.
1370 2018-02-22 23:06:21 Many midwives want to be able to test more pregnant women for group B Strep carriage with the ECM (gold standard) test, described by PHE’s UK SMI B58 & recommended by RCOG. 

But they can't - maternal request isn't a permitted reason to offer the test on the NHS. Why not?

One of the most fascinating studies I've read in a while!

E.g. 

"Second, because unrelated females rarely cooperate as a group, one woman's success brings little benefit to the female community."

What’s up with that?
1381 2018-02-22 23:05:51 Women athletes should definitely get paid more IMO. My point: the US Women’s hockey team just won gold and the US Women’s soccer team is defending World Cup champions. Their men’s counterparts lost in the quarterfinals and failed to qualify for the World Cup.
1382 2018-02-22 23:05:50 @halladayfan32 is one of the best people you'll meet online or anywhere!  Congrats to #TeamUSA on the gold in womens' hockey.  I'm sure #TeamCanada is already thinking of taking back gold in Beijing!

1388 2018-02-22 23:05:37 And WHY did they feel the need to bring freiza back anyway like, hey, remember him? How scary he was? But now goku and vegetables have gotten literally so strong he's no threat unless,,,,,he turns gold?

1401 2018-02-22 23:05:01 @HC_Women @TeamCanada Dear women’s hockey team. I am sorry you didn’t win the gold but please don’t disrespect yourselves and other athletes by not being “happy” with your silver. It does not look good on you.Many, many other athletes would kill to be in your position. #Olympics

1408 2018-02-22 23:04:48 Or just never tell your kids, since a shootout should absolutely not decide the Olympic gold medal game

1435 2018-02-22 23:03:32 I give her a Gold medal for passion.   She wasn’t rude, she didn’t spit on it, or throw away. It’s a bitter pill, a scarlet letter.  She simply removed it.  I love that she showed how much she cared.

1443 2018-02-22 23:03:21 Watched Anna Gasser win #Gold last night in women's big air and she was incredible!! 
1444 2018-02-22 23:03:19 “Charity, I’m dying for a cup of tea. #Yorkshire Gold, milk in first. It’d mean a lot_”
“It’s O.K, it’s O.K.” Charity patted Verity’s wrist.
The Professor walked in. 
He saw the gesture: saw Verity break down in tears. 
He paled. Right before his eyes: the English Method.

1450 2018-02-22 23:03:02 Sorry. Can't get all gushy about a team winning a gold medal that would get beat by a middle of the road boys high school team.
1451 2018-02-22 23:02:58 I hope you all got to watch @jessdiggs win the gold. It was exciting, nerve wrecking and everything that sports are ment to be.  She showed the world how you finish a race! #USA #ponypride #carrythetorch

1456 2018-02-22 23:02:40 Watching replay of USA Women's Hockey. They don't know it yet but, they have the Gold Medal in the bag. Great thing about replays, I know Canada lost. They can mug the camera and bully all they want, it has no effect. USA USA USA #GoTeamUSA

1464 2018-02-22 23:02:32 @AmandaKessel8 you might wanna change your profile to Gold Medalist. 
1465 2018-02-22 23:02:30 This is the difference between a “fixed mindset” and a “growth mindset.” When you see things as black and white - you either win gold or four year’s effort is wasted - then you act like this athlete. The awesome book #Mindsets taught me this and I see it throughout sports now...

1469 2018-02-22 23:02:23 I'm not following him I made a comment about him retiring so he called me a white and a gold digger
1470 2018-02-22 23:02:22 Realistically Rahsaan Evans is just a perfect fit from a need and scheme standpoint. After him...Taven Bryan the DT from Florida could be a perfect compliment inside and nice part of the rotation.  Also like Ronnie Harrison the Bama Safety...reminds me a lot of Landon Collins. 
1471 2018-02-22 23:02:21 congrats and have fun x

1499 2018-02-22 23:01:19 Fair. Bad analogy. I just know she went to Pyeong Chang for one thing, and one thing only: a gold medal. Doesn't make her a sore loser. I admire the compete level.

1509 2018-02-22 23:01:01 Why don’t we ever question regulation like this, before gold plating it? Does it help the consumer if he’s/ she’s give. More paper. Best way to hide things is in plain sight.
1510 2018-02-22 23:01:00 Watching the rebroadcast of the gold medal game, and I never thought I would ever be saying this, but in the clutch moments, the US stepped up and Canada panicked

1526 2018-02-22 23:00:27 So is it safe to assume #USA women's hockey will win gold in 2020 since they've won '98 in Nagano and '18 in PyeongChang since the next #Olympics are again in Asia with Beijing?
1527 2018-02-22 23:00:26 Yeah, I think he got guilted into this behavior last week. But, I'll give him some gold stars for 'standing his ground' on this one ... esp. @ televised town meeting.

1530 2018-02-22 23:00:21 For her to say that shows that she's the one that thinks such a horrible thing is gold.
1531 2018-02-22 23:00:19 holy shit this is literally so...........??? like these ppl have been training for 15+ years but u go and say a 1 yr old anime inspired them to get gold YEA OK LMAO
1532 2018-02-22 23:00:19 

I mostly find it weird that people are saying she should’ve kept it on. She worked unfathomably hard for four years to win gold, not silver. I don’t have an issue with her taking it off.
1533 2018-02-22 23:00:17 so when can we start making the movie about the us national women’s team and how they boycotted the world championship for pay equity,
won, then won gold at the olympics
1534 2018-02-22 23:00:16 Not poor sport just annoyed and wanted gold, understood
1535 2018-02-22 23:00:15 It’s like DC owns this goldmine. Filled with gold. They keep sending down miners. Some good. Some not. They come back either empty handed or clutching a huge pile of horseshite.
1536 2018-02-22 23:00:15 @jessdiggs your GOLD medal race was incredibly inspiring...what the Olympics are all about. Congratulations and can't wait to see you repeat in 4 years!
1537 2018-02-22 23:00:12 oh and i didn't mention it, but there is a grind cap of a hundred gold, you only get 10 gold every 3 wins, there are daily quests with gold rewards but they are usually 40 gold.

1569 2018-02-22 22:59:06 Cuando das por el heart gold?
1570 2018-02-22 22:59:05 Olympic Hockey. I’m Canadian and I will say the USA was the better team. But just about the poor sport comment. 16 years ago when they met for gold it was the USA team the put the Canadian flag on the floor in their locker room and stomped on it. This started the rival.
1571 2018-02-22 22:59:02 How many consecutive years is Buxton going to win a gold glove?
1572 2018-02-22 22:59:02 the future of Cellphone is one thats made of soft bread and filled with raspberry jelly. in 10 years this will be the standard and i will live in a house made of gold, which will be considered worthless by then because of its low berry content
1573 2018-02-22 22:59:00 Don't wanna brag but in Canada, "CAMILA" is already platinum, Havana is 6x platinum (good chance of going Diamond), NBTS is already gold.

1578 2018-02-22 22:58:50 Watched the Men's Canadian relay team get Bronze in the 5,000m too and they were first for awhile but in the last lap or so Hungary got ahead  sigh and they did the dab when they were getting their #Gold medals 
1579 2018-02-22 22:58:49 LePerrie is talking about the God Of Gold. Chysos.
1580 2018-02-22 22:58:46 .@maddie_rooney35 outstanding play last night and congrats to you and your team on taking the gold #Olympics2018 @usahockey #goalieunion @NHL
1581 2018-02-22 22:58:45 Yank his gold-plated pension and heath benefits, and watch the corpulent deputies freak out.
1582 2018-02-22 22:58:44 Stranger things have happened! We just won Gold in Cross country Skiing? Wha???? I smell Gold for @TeamShuster !
1583 2018-02-22 22:58:42 Hope gold digger twitter doesn't destroy my mentions lol
1584 2018-02-22 22:58:41 You need to change your profile from silver to gold medal. Congrats! @AmandaKessel8
1585 2018-02-22 22:58:38 @TeamCanada Jocelyne Larocque of team Canada should be stripped of her silver medal. So you didn’t win the gold medal… How many hockey players that played in the Olympics would do anything to win the silver?!?!?!
1586 2018-02-22 22:58:31 I love @ThatGuyChaxy Since the day I saw him. I thought he was cool. He has always been there. I think he is worth gold and more. Before I was just so broken to realise that I was losing out on him by being selfish. HELP us
1587 2018-02-22 22:58:29 They should have used our version. They would have won triple gold medals
1588 2018-02-22 22:58:28 It was comedy gold earlier in season that some thought we could buy a CL ready centre half to drop in given injuries/form etc. Celtic cannot pay £15/20m for centre half. Ntcham looks great but was gamble. Some of those will go wrong. IMO Roberts is questionable at top level
1589 2018-02-22 22:58:27 You are so cute! & perfect  I wish you a gold (❁ᴗˬᴗ)♡
1590 2018-02-22 22:58:25 Dioxin is apparently the new gold. Or just bashing their heads has been a reliable workhorse as well.

As we did with the silver, Can we plan on a GOLD visit at Kelly elementary?
1594 2018-02-22 22:58:14 elderly like seeing gold tone object seen his older gentleman with Classic 1975 RV Spray Gold Paint trim, bumper, Rims  only took 7 cans
1595 2018-02-22 22:58:14 Gold was not used as money because it was valuable; It became valuable because it was used as money.
1596 2018-02-22 22:58:14 Bring home the gold, fellows!
1597 2018-02-22 22:58:13 I got in the river, they made path was acquainted with gold, and that one with the trunks.
1598 2018-02-22 22:58:12 @TheFive  The real winners was the US Women's Cross country Ski team who won the gold medal, first time US has won any kind of medal in that sport in Olympics history.
1599 2018-02-22 22:58:09 Can not WAIT to stay up all night to watch this gold medal curling match! I’ve watched every USA curling match of the Olympics #USA #Curling #TeamShuster

1605 2018-02-22 22:58:00 I still think 'you can give fish and feed someone for a day,  but teach them to fish and they will eat forever' works in the MMO gold making as well.
1606 2018-02-22 22:57:57 Like damn nigga you really want to live without infrastructure and have your neighborhoods fall into sounds cause all ya money wasn't backed by gold
1607 2018-02-22 22:57:55 @UnboxTherapy u said in a video of yours that we could the phone of our choice is it available. Im a big fan of u a I was traveling while u posted this video could I have the iphone 8 plus gold please

1610 2018-02-22 22:57:51 رائع
1611 2018-02-22 22:57:50 I still feel good about last night.

And apparently US beat Canada for gold in Curling, too. lol
1612 2018-02-22 22:57:49 Rewatching the end of the gold medal game from last night. Still exciting even though I know the result. #USAWomensHockey #TeamUSA #Olympics2018
1613 2018-02-22 22:57:48 The gold and navy gear needs to make a comeback
1614 2018-02-22 22:57:48 @TheFive 
We offer congrats to the US Women’s Hockey for their gold medal win, but please don’t disparage our highly competitive female athletes.

Be honest - if the your team lost to Canada - you wouldn’t have even mentioned it.

All the best from a faithful northern viewer.
1615 2018-02-22 22:57:47 Worst ever #referee #CANvsUSA how much @TeamUSA pay to steal the gold medal
1616 2018-02-22 22:57:43 2 tons of gold? Dang... Please show me a believable article that explains that.
1617 2018-02-22 22:57:43 Congrats to our USA Women's Hockey team for winning the Gold medal!! The Canadian team displayed poor sportsmanship.  I mean taking off your medal during the ceremony, seriously?!
1618 2018-02-22 22:57:38 今週は朝起きるたびに体がだる重いで気分ものらない(´Д` )

1619 2018-02-22 22:57:36 Got into a game of Ranked Play got teamed with 2 gold who didnt know any call outs. They've really lowered th standards for this game...
1620 2018-02-22 22:57:33 Gold hoop & chocolate skin, that’s a perfect combo sir . Can never have too much of the other
1621 2018-02-22 22:57:28 Everything about it was gold the picture the caption the thought lmao
1622 2018-02-22 22:57:25 @DLoesch says “Crying white mothers are ratings gold.”  This is what she thinks of the people she spoke to last night. Too cowardly to say this in front of the crowd last night. What an awful person.
1623 2018-02-22 22:57:25 They should but they won’t, Conor is gold in promoting & Dana was like best friends with Ronda whereas he & Conor are in constant negotiations with each other. They have a business relationship.
1624 2018-02-22 22:57:24 If #TeamCanada showing frustration w/ silver is the BIGGEST Canada-related scandal@ #Pyeongchang2018 , I'm fine.  Beats @RebagliatiGold  TEMPORARILY losing his gold due 2 marijuana inhalation, or r Cndn ice dance having 2 SHARE the gold w/ the Russians bcuz of suspect judging
1625 2018-02-22 22:57:22 أستغفر الله العظيم
1626 2018-02-22 22:57:19 @DLoesch is so vile as to accuse media of wanting crying white mothers as “Gold” for viewers.  She would haven’t had the balls to have said that Wednesday night in front of Parkland audience. She struts the stage like a phony preacher!
1627 2018-02-22 22:57:12 Big time confirmed my curling fandom today. I excitedly told a coworker that USA men’s curling beat Canada this morning and will play for the gold. He replied that he doesn’t give a shit about curling, and my natural reaction was to tell him to fuck off. 
1628 2018-02-22 22:57:10 Sorry for your loss! #Not #GoUSA #Gold
1629 2018-02-22 22:57:07 Greeted with a sendoff today as we begin our weekend quest for gold!  Thank you BlueJay nation for taking time to show your support!
1630 2018-02-22 22:57:05 Why didn't you say "white women's tears are ratings gold" last night at the town meeting? I'll wait.....
1631 2018-02-22 22:57:04 Wow! So proud of you, Frank. I try to never miss you on #OnStage in @NY1. Now bring home the gold!

1633 2018-02-22 22:57:00 Have watched parts of replay of U.S./Canada women’s gold-medal game this afternoon. From what I’ve see, what a game between two absolutely incredible, fantastic teams playing for the ultimate prize.
1634 2018-02-22 22:56:51 NRA spokeswoman, white mother's crying is gold ratings.  Really ? What about all mother's?
1635 2018-02-22 22:56:39 Lots of gold that's how...
1636 2018-02-22 22:56:38 Great assessment Ben! I want him in green and gold next year!! Of course, I'm just a tad biased due to my address though

1641 2018-02-22 22:56:22 If the good guy with a gun thing had ANY merit- you'd be able to walk down the street naked, carrying gold bars, and not be touched.

1650 2018-02-22 22:56:05 Hi. You don't know me, but I have perfected the art of professionally email-slapping people in such a way that HR can't get angry. I just wanted you to know, this is gold!
1651 2018-02-22 22:55:56 @martybiron43  After the Olympics, can we have a discussion about the NWHL, their impact on The Games, and any Triple Gold Club equivalents?   A question for @TheInstigators  perhaps?
1652 2018-02-22 22:55:50 If you couldn't stay up to watch the @usahockey women win #Gold @NBCSN running the full replay. Getting ready for the overtime and incredible shootout right now. #Olympics
1653 2018-02-22 22:55:44 Love that the men's hockey gold medal game is set for 11:10 PM ET on Saturday night. 

Do not love the schedule for the semis.
1654 2018-02-22 22:55:44 When it was old was gold
1655 2018-02-22 22:55:44 Wayman put OU basketball on the map and his presence and impact changed the program forever. He was a 3-time AA his freshman, sophomore and junior seasons--first player ever to achieve that honor, and 1984 Olympic Gold Medalist. Solid 12 year NBA career, too.
1656 2018-02-22 22:55:42 A big shout out the the Aldershot senior band for their efforts in achieving a Gold Prize at the Golden horseshoe Music Festival!

1663 2018-02-22 22:55:20 Told a real funny joke at work today. You ready guys...

"You reckon Im getting paid for this extra 2 hours I worked?" 

Comedy gold amirite? 
1664 2018-02-22 22:55:20 Having a drink and the #usawomenshockey gold medal game replay is on. Guy talking loudly spoils that it goes to OT and shootout. Everyone around the bar is not happy with him. Haha.
1665 2018-02-22 22:55:20 Ehh I'm ok with it- there's no runner up trophy for the super bowl. Came so close to gold, emotions are high. As far as I can tell she doesn't throw it on the ground or anything.

1670 2018-02-22 22:55:08 I could careless how they do it. Do they hand out silver and bronze medals?! Do they stand on the podium as winners?! Do they raise their country’s flag?! Too many athletes get screwed out of gold because of horrible judging and corruption.
1671 2018-02-22 22:55:08 Buzz off Stevo. Stop lobbying for another stupid idea about the game. It has been this long for 100+ years. I’ve half lost interest in AFL as it is. I’m on the border of canceling 5 Gold AFL Memberships. My kids don’t go anymore. Zero interest.

1673 2018-02-22 22:55:06 People often ask me if I'd rather work "primetime" or daytime hours. The answer is HECK NO! I get to be on the air after breathtaking Super Bowl finishes, extra-inning World Series games & gold medal shootouts!! Love it!
1674 2018-02-22 22:55:00 They must have cut some sort of backroom Trump branded weapons deal. Big gold "T" on the grip. Or whatever you call it.
1675 2018-02-22 22:54:57 If you didn’t have chance to watch the #USAvCAN gold medal #IceHockey game last night, do yourself a favor and watch the replay. Such a good game. We laughed. We cried. We won!!!! #TeamUSA

1680 2018-02-22 22:54:48 yeah my mouth is full of gold and ima city boyyyy
1681 2018-02-22 22:54:45 Congrats on the gold! What a great game! Thank you!
1682 2018-02-22 22:54:36 You’re from nothing you really think there’s gold in you ?
1683 2018-02-22 22:54:31 I agree...but after 20 years, that gold medal is well deserved...and FYI, Megan Aghosto who plays for the Canadian team is hot as hell 
1684 2018-02-22 22:54:30 haha dude fucking gold
1685 2018-02-22 22:54:26 True but gold medal should never go to a shootout
1686 2018-02-22 22:54:25 I need few minutes of silence to appreciate this gold
1687 2018-02-22 22:54:18 Remember how had Yuuri scored about 10 pts lower than his season best in his SP at GPF and still only lost gold by a fraction of a point despite the th GM'S SP score was over 20 pts higher than his? And y'all are still out here thinking he's not that good of a good skater?
1688 2018-02-22 22:54:16 You are more than diamond, more than gold.

1701 2018-02-22 22:53:51 Tbh I dont think it's that at all. You have to understand the moment and the situation of just losing a gold medal game. I have no prob w it
1702 2018-02-22 22:53:50 Gold is very much correlated to the DXY right now and to a lesser extent the S&P 500. Check out $/CNY and XAU/CNY also.
1703 2018-02-22 22:53:49 She's upset, she put her heart into a game and the team came up short. Some people think Silver is a participation trophy but the games recognize the work of teams that win Gold, Silver and Bronze. That's the neat thing about the Olympics. I'll give her a pass. It was raw emotion

1727 2018-02-22 22:52:52 Decided I need gold toe ones
1728 2018-02-22 22:52:48 That’s for you too Gary. Your medal is far bigger than any false gold. Your heart bigger and stronger than any football legend. You guys are legends, for making football a safer place. God bless. And thank you. 
1729 2018-02-22 22:52:43 Wale- Black is Gold
1730 2018-02-22 22:52:41 I dont know why. Thats gold
1731 2018-02-22 22:52:40 Not near as bad as many say he is, but not the gold standard. Give me Vin Scully any day.  He’ll be critical when necessary, but never to where you think he hates your team.  You know listening to him that he just loves the game - even if it takes an “unmanageable” 4+ hours.
1732 2018-02-22 22:52:38 You know what's gold? Your kids making it home safely from school every single day.
1733 2018-02-22 22:52:38 Everyone staying up tonight to see the pride of NL Kaetlyn Osmond take home that gold? She skates at 1:10 AM and only two skaters after her.
Let's go Kaetlyn! #TeamCanada #Olympics #newfoundland #kaetlynosmond

1736 2018-02-22 22:52:26 @RealKingRegal is pure gold. Comedy, dirty heel, autority figure, in-ring general, mic master, you say and he has it. He must become a #wwehalloffamer
1737 2018-02-22 22:52:21 Trust that everything will work out for you. Maybe not exactly as you planned. But perfectly for the evolution of your soul.
1738 2018-02-22 22:52:21 "Crying white mothers are ratings gold". You truly are a vile person, #NRA Spokesbarbie. No empathy, no sympathy. Won't be long before @realdonaldtRump asks you to join his WH Staff. Hurry though; he'll be gone soon #impeachtRump

1741 2018-02-22 22:52:16 @greggutfeld Thank you so much for calling out Juan on the CNN story where he was trying to make it a big thing. Seemed he wanted to blame the little old lady you won. You got a gold medal 
1742 2018-02-22 22:52:12 So let's not even tryyyyyy. I can almost hear the UØ / LTP collab already. Their instrumentals are gold.

1746 2018-02-22 22:52:08 Haha no gold king
1747 2018-02-22 22:52:05 When can I watch USA win gold in curling? That’s all I care about right now.
1748 2018-02-22 22:52:01 I'm torn on the 'ratings gold' comment. On the one hand, I don't see media as heartless monsters. On the other, there is a problem how we cover gun violence. My solution definitely wouldn't mesh with DL, though.
1749 2018-02-22 22:51:59 chinese gold farmers who depreciate your server's in game economy is like ... curl bros in the squat rack. 2,200 words.

1751 2018-02-22 22:51:54 @deptulahasrage watching the replay of the USA Gold match they just tied it up 2-2 in the third, still got goosebumps
1752 2018-02-22 22:51:53 Just watched the #USA tie #CAN in this women’s gold medal game and got chills all over again.
1753 2018-02-22 22:51:51 IT’S NOT JUST A MEDAL, IT’S THE GOLD!
1754 2018-02-22 22:51:47 i can't believe yuuri katsuki inspired yuzuru hanyu to become an olympic gold medalist
1755 2018-02-22 22:51:45 God has been good, I truly can't complain
1756 2018-02-22 22:51:45 I wish legislators cared about what’s right as much as Olympians care about Gold
1757 2018-02-22 22:51:41 Fantastic and bring home the gold medal #Commonwealth games

1765 2018-02-22 22:51:02 I don't think it will kill them to wait. Either that or only recognize gold medalists at the time like happens in football
1766 2018-02-22 22:51:02 why are ppl being such babies about the silver we got in womens hockey lmao saying ~u dont WIN silver u just get it when u lose gold~ no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S NOT THAT SERIOUS lmao god forbid you only be the SECOND best team in the world??

1769 2018-02-22 22:50:55 I shit you not, I just had a client tell me him and his wife were hesitant to put money in the stock market during the Obama years so he bought gold coins instead, but now that there's some hope for the market with Trump he's ready to invest again. Public accounting is fun!
1770 2018-02-22 22:50:55 Congrats to the #US women's hockey Gold win!

1781 2018-02-22 22:50:23 @DanBarreiroKFAN damn people calling the US Women's Olympic hockey team win a miracle and comparing it to the 1980 team are delusional. This Woman's team was pre-tournament favorites to win gold
1782 2018-02-22 22:50:19 What are your favorites at 32? Ill give you mine after :)
1783 2018-02-22 22:50:18 I think the US Women getting so much press today is because them winning gold is like Haley's comet or something. Only opportunity this generation has to blog about it. #CANvsUSA
1784 2018-02-22 22:50:16 Mr. T livetweeting curling all week is my favorite thing if the moment  RT @MrT: Congratulations US Men’s Curling team on your victory over Canada. Now you curl for the Gold. Ain’t that something?! Wow!

1787 2018-02-22 22:50:07 "Crying white mothers" are ratings gold to the NRA, which then gets to cry, "O.M.G. They want to take our guns!" She only gets to yell that when there's been another mass murder.
1788 2018-02-22 22:50:04 People are bitching because a shootout has decided more then just this Gold Medal game, its embarassing that this is how it’s decided
1789 2018-02-22 22:50:00 Würden Sie bitte bei nächster Gelegenheit wieder eine Gegenrede zu einem AfD-Antrag halten, ja?

Das ist ja mit Gold nicht aufzuwiegen, danke.

1796 2018-02-22 22:49:49 I’m SCREAMING this is gold
1797 2018-02-22 22:49:48 As if that has not always been the case: Since we've unshackled ourselves from fixed-price convertibility to gold and/or pegs to other currencies, the U.S. Government spends as much and on whatever the U.S. Congress appropriates and authorizes, without exogenous restraint.
1798 2018-02-22 22:49:47 Nope. Many people were saying before the Games started, shootouts don’t belong in Gold Medal hockey.....if  won , I’d say the same thing, as would many.....

1811 2018-02-22 22:49:14 I have 5 Gold AFL Memberships. If this stupid idea eventuates all those memberships are getting cancelled. Sick of all these rocket scientists tampering with the game and all these stupid suggestions.

1815 2018-02-22 22:49:09 I know our uni colours are black and gold but I really wish at least one of the Sports Officer candidates had a different colour scheme/looked completely different, it was REALLY difficult to tell them apart when live blogging #knowyourvote #ShefSUvotes
1816 2018-02-22 22:49:03 #JocelyneLarocque  You have embarrassed your country and should be ashamed of yourself.  What a disgraceful act you did....what, Canada can only have gold or nothing at all?  Get over it Jocelyne....shame on you

1822 2018-02-22 22:48:52 @CNN @Thomas_Friedman #NRA spokeswoman says grieving white mothers is "ratings gold"-it's the NRA state of mind. Now we hear sheriffs were on scene, but did nothing. Yet gun lobby attacks #FBI & everyone else. The statements made are disgusting. Back to Jekyll Island with them!
1823 2018-02-22 22:48:51 Всё ещё gold
1824 2018-02-22 22:48:51 It's completely normal to re-watch the USA vs. Canada Women's Hockey Gold Medal Game, right? #olympicponder
1825 2018-02-22 22:48:48 Olympic gold in hockey, Olympic win over Canada in curling, and 32 new charges against Paul Manafort...it is a good day to be an American!
1826 2018-02-22 22:48:48 my great aunt just me a Facebook message saying my job isn’t good enough, my boyfriend is probably a gold digger, and if I’m not around enough he’s going to cheat on me and that if I’m not more polite and cordial he’s going to leave me!
1827 2018-02-22 22:48:45 Love it! @NRA S'woman "Crying white mothers are ratings gold!" @CNN & ALL anchors struck gold w #ParklandShooting . No @wolfblitzer, NOT ALL journalists. Only you guys. You love the shootings bec it plays into yr agenda: hate f NRA & @POTUS  . You NEVER cover Chicago! Why not?
1828 2018-02-22 22:48:44 @AdVenture_CapHH Thanks for the gold!!
1829 2018-02-22 22:48:39 Omg I’m laughing my head off. Takes me back to high school with my gold velveteen wide whale corderoys. I just can’t bring myself to ever wear cords again. All I can say is thank God for stretchy jeans!
1830 2018-02-22 22:48:39 NBC could someone get their heads out of your asses when it comes to the replays. Men's curling semi and women's hockey gold replays both on at the same time. 
#gottabebetter
1831 2018-02-22 22:48:38 This Canadian will be cheering for you guys for gold! #gogetit

1833 2018-02-22 22:48:19 i had this same discussion with someone over the use of sniper.
I disagreed with him in the idea that when you start using sniper you have given up the rights to feign ignorance.

There are plenty of blogs,  YouTube videos etc on how to use the AH and make gold.  Reading is good.
1834 2018-02-22 22:48:18 Red & White + silver = an unusual colour combo for #Canadian women's #Olympic hockey team, but they're 3 colours to be worn with pride! 
Congratulations, @HC_Women! Going for gold in 2022!
1835 2018-02-22 22:48:18 @goldrushtodd I'm writing you from Denmark, we have been a group of friends following gold rush since day one. All the time wishing you more success for having a golden heart, and getting what you deserve for you and your family. Admire your decision, wish you the best.

1838 2018-02-22 22:48:16 ...and #Babcock would be right.....Gold or Silver for , shootouts are no way to decide the Olympic Champ....
1839 2018-02-22 22:48:13 ... yet with every Indian drama series you find on tv the families are dressed in similar outfits coupled with gold necklaces/chains/earrings and full makeup before breakfast... but we don’t do that in Bollywood

1842 2018-02-22 22:48:12 Well @DLoesch at Town Hall you didn't speak like you did today at CPAC saying and with attitude "legacy media love mass shootings, you guys love it", "crying white mothers are ratings gold." Your a coward Loesech. Why didn't you say that to students and parents faces last night?
1843 2018-02-22 22:48:11 Crypto has been a godsend for people all over in the same position. I'm glad to hear how big of a help it has been to you. I'm interested to see how the PTR & the recently announced Petro Gold crypto will function. Regardless, best of profits & luck to you, my friend.
1844 2018-02-22 22:48:11 He does. He thinks he walks upright, he thinks velcro shoes are just like tying them, he thinks combable back hair is sexy... 

I think he IS starting to doubt that he's going to win the gold in Olympic Nose Picking by 2024, though
1845 2018-02-22 22:48:10 Winning a gold medal in a shootout is cheap. Americans would've lost their minds if Canada wins in the shootout. Sorry but I'll never be okay with a team winning in a joke skills contest
1846 2018-02-22 22:48:08 あげます
仙台行きます
1847 2018-02-22 22:48:03 Thank you, my Canadian friend!  Your girls gave us a run!  And they are such incredible champions...all that gold the past 4 olympics!  We are lucky to have squeaked that win out.  Proud of both teams.  The USA respects your girls.  That champion spirit is the olympics!
1848 2018-02-22 22:48:01 Finally the USA-Canada curling is on (CNBC)

I made the strategic decision to sleep after the hockey game and watch whatever the curlers' medal game turned out to be--did not really expect it to be for gold

a) ESC-. and ESC-/ are also nice keybindings
b) '?' at the automore prompt gives you help
c) "set security certificates apply-flags omit" is worth its weight in gold

1854 2018-02-22 22:47:52 My grandfather said he would win the gold medal for Olympic maple tapping. If that’s not the most Canadian sentence, idk what is.
1855 2018-02-22 22:47:51 Yeah I’m glad we’re not in a desperate position of need at WR, the class is underwhelming.  I wouldn’t mind going BPA at 32 or sliding back in an effort to recoup some picks.
1856 2018-02-22 22:47:44 Will Smith’s IG is pure gold
1857 2018-02-22 22:47:41 I'm all for giving them the gold medals - that's a great moment. Hell even the bronze (because, you win bronze) - but forcing a team to sit through their opposition's celebration, especially a bitter rival, to get medals they probably don't want right now....

1863 2018-02-22 22:47:26 This Olympics has had  a courtesy level from everyone - OCOG staff, volunteers, other journalists - unlike any I can remember.  Never have heard so many say “excuse me” and “sorry” when they inadvertently jostle you.   Gold medal to everyone for civil behavior.
1864 2018-02-22 22:47:24 Just Tapped: @foundersbrewing Apricot Wheat, @foundersbrewing Solid Gold, @BreweryOmmegang Ginnepin
1865 2018-02-22 22:47:19 “Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you and many in the legacy media … notice I said ‘crying white mothers’ because there are thousands of grieving black mothers in Chicago every weekend, and you don’t see townhalls for them, do you? Where’s the CNN town hall for Chicago?”
1866 2018-02-22 22:47:17 Pure gold.

1868 2018-02-22 22:47:10 NOT TRUE SIR!!! Obama was handed a depression and still hit GDP of 3 or more 8 times. He handed Trump a gold mine on automatic pilot. Trump hit GDP in 2nd quarter of Presidency. It’s still Obama’s economy. Trump simply jumped in front of Obama parade as the drum major.
1869 2018-02-22 22:47:08 I need gold like a  ye I need  gold.
1870 2018-02-22 22:47:01 "Crying white mothers are ratings gold." ??? @NRA @CPAC, With this you now define yourselves among the worst of us. As lobbyists, you are simply legalized corruption, not unlike the rest. But, as people? There aren't so many second chances... Just ask the kids.
1871 2018-02-22 22:46:59 i had my gold toes on yesterday it just made me fall in love with 1s again but for these ion wanna wait i need to make a decision
1872 2018-02-22 22:46:51 Oh man - these tweets and this entire thread - comedy gold. Thank you.
1873 2018-02-22 22:46:50 Basically a flip of the 2014 gold medal game.

1877 2018-02-22 22:46:35 Why are you like this?
1878 2018-02-22 22:46:29 @NBCOlympics US Olympic Women Gold on the same Day of the 1980 Miracle on Ice Mens Gold over the Soviets!! Congrats!!
1879 2018-02-22 22:46:28 With only 2 competitive teams, you’ve either won gold or lost the tournament. There’s really no silver. Still a classless move.

1881 2018-02-22 22:46:19 Every 4 years, for 2 weeks, I become super popular at work because I'm on a #curling team. Based off the number of congratulations I've gotten today, I can only assume I am also on #TeamUSA and @TeamShuster and playing for the #gold. #ThanksGuys #CurlingCommunity
1882 2018-02-22 22:46:19 As always some amazing competitions this Olympics. Big Air Snowboard today was crazy. A snowboarder winning an Alpine downhill gold, the women's hockey final. The men's curling run, which is still going.
1883 2018-02-22 22:46:18 .@DLoesch today, at CPAC, you stated that "many in legacy media love mass shootings. You guys love it" then you went on to say that "...crying white mothers are ratings gold to you..." Why didn't you make the same comments last night in Sunrise, FL? I'll wait.

1886 2018-02-22 22:46:12 Tough loss all of Canada feels your pain but in hindsight probably should have waited a little longer to remove the medal  I understand gold was the goal but millions were watching and the backlash was inevitable #payback2022

1889 2018-02-22 22:46:08 Gold-plated DB pensions aren’t a contractural right...
1890 2018-02-22 22:46:05 @NRA spokeswoman @DLoesch is a disgusting human being.  Her “crying white mothers are ratings gold” comment is disgraceful.  I beg everyone to stop voting for politicians who accept money from the @NRA.  We are better than this.
1891 2018-02-22 22:46:03 @DLoesch seeing your mother’s tears because she gave birth to a morally bankrupt, inhumane monster would be ratings gold. #neveragain
1892 2018-02-22 22:46:00 Seek wisdom more than gold.
1893 2018-02-22 22:45:59 Watching a replay of the #GOLD medal #Hockey match and it’s incredible! #USA #USA #USA
1894 2018-02-22 22:45:58 This is gold. Will upvote RFN.
1895 2018-02-22 22:45:57 Students will continue their second day participating in their Social Studies Olympics tomorrow.  Students answer questions like, how did the building of the CPR effect Canada? Teams get a chance to win gold, silver, and bronze. Go teams go!

1898 2018-02-22 22:45:52 We have more in common than not, and I hope someday we can all find common ground in politics and more importantly in life. Putin’s bet a fiddle of gold against our American souls, and it’s gonna take all of us- Republican, Democrat and in between, to remind
1899 2018-02-22 22:45:49 Far too many black jerseys and white jerseys in MLS these days. Change kit should be gold. No one else uses that shade. Own it.

1902 2018-02-22 22:45:44 I’m sorry I’m just never going to stop talking about the gold medal game
1903 2018-02-22 22:45:43 Sutton has potential, no doubt, ridley could be a deep threat and certainly is a speedy agile athlete, but none of them gets me pumped when i watch tape... John Ross, Corey Davis and mike williams (to some extend) flashed in college
1904 2018-02-22 22:45:38 Do you have any pieces that are pink/grey/gold colors? I was hoping to buy something for my room!  I’m in love with the one you posted for the contest!
1905 2018-02-22 22:45:38 Yes @DLoesch is THAT HEINOUS. @tomfriedman's right she says it in front of #CPAC18 super conservatives bec she was 2 scared 2 say it in front of parents whose kids were just slaughtered like animals by the guns sick Dana loves "Crying white mothers r media gold" #PsychoDana
1906 2018-02-22 22:45:37 It popped up on my memories from fb.. I've posted a few quotes from you, they are gold

1908 2018-02-22 22:45:24 Replay of Olympic women's hockey gold-medal game is on in the office.

I thought Maddie Rooney played basketball. And was blonde.

Maybe I watch too much Disney Channel.
1909 2018-02-22 22:45:16 "Many in legacy media love mass shootings. You guys love it. I'm not saying that you love the tragedy, but I am saying that you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you and many of the legacy media in the back." - Dana Loesch
1910 2018-02-22 22:45:14 I like Ketchup Chips and Tim Hortons....but so happy we are moving on! Get that GOLD!
1911 2018-02-22 22:45:08 Mansa Musa right... so what went wrong? He disrupted local economies by giving away gold when he would pass through towns.

1917 2018-02-22 22:44:52 I only hit gold a while back ago and it got annoying to play with random diamonds. I understand that there was a skill gap between myself and those other players. It got discouraging losing to someone I did not really have the game knowledge to match

And I don’t think he’s as bad as people think. Is he gold glove? No. But he’s not a problem.
1939 2018-02-22 22:44:02 aghhh mamonaaaa
1940 2018-02-22 22:44:02 Fuck you, @DLoesch and your “crying white mothers ratings gold”. You’re a sick human being. And yet I STILL hope you never have to actually BE the “crying white mother” of a massacred child.  These #Parkland parents just buried their babies and are still fighting. #NeverAgain

1950 2018-02-22 22:43:40 What exactly have you accomplished in hockey that grants you the right to comment on an OLYMPIAN’S play in a gold medal game? #ArmchairOlympian
1951 2018-02-22 22:43:36 the packs cost about 100 gold. as a beginner you are showered with packs and gold but that quickly subsides. the entire system of crafting and drafting is set up in a way that makes it nearly impossible to get top tier decks by play alone, you will have to pay a lot of money to..

1958 2018-02-22 22:43:21 That’s not very persuasive.  Actually It reeks of profound insecurity, and it’s smug.  Keep on skipping facts and logic and hand yourself more of those gold stars.

1962 2018-02-22 22:43:15 Lose more gracefully than when you win. Tell my 5 year old son that all the time. I believe there is WAY more lessons to be learned when you lose than when you win. At the moment it may be all about the gold but in end it is not all about the gold.

Maybe @DLoesch crying for her slain children will be "ratings gold". Given the comments you made about the grieving Mom's I doubt you'd weep over your own kids.

2008 2018-02-22 22:41:43 Article Below: Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro has ordered the country’s consular services, and gas stations, to accept any cryptocurrency including the nation’s own petro. In addition, he has announced the launch of another cryptocurrency, this time backed with gold.

2021 2018-02-22 22:41:18 Sick White Woman!!!! How can she say such horrendous poison!!! “ Crying White Women crying is ratings gold”..  sick!!!#MSDstrong
2022 2018-02-22 22:41:09 I just want to point out that I've been left emotionally damaged by that women's hockey gold medal game. 
2023 2018-02-22 22:41:03 What a brave woman @dloesch is to condemn the media and suggest mass shootings are ‘ratings gold.’ Didn’t hear that in CNN forum. You are disgusting. #NRAIsATerroristOrganization
2024 2018-02-22 22:41:02 有難う！僕にやけちゃうじゃんㅋㅋ
2025 2018-02-22 22:40:59 @DLoesch Your comments today about crying mothers are ratings gold were disgusting! You need to crawl back under the rock you came from!!

2027 2018-02-22 22:40:55 When you get your silver medal in the Olympics, when you were striving for gold you can do what fukk you like with it... Till then keep yer opinion about our athletes to yerself.
2028 2018-02-22 22:40:54 @Racing_UK @kemptonparkrace your right, but the race they want to win is gold cup,a lot chelt runers wil hav had race 2 many.
2029 2018-02-22 22:40:51 Commentary is just absolute gold on this.
2030 2018-02-22 22:40:49 Canadian curlers have made going to the Olympics bigger than winning gold.
2031 2018-02-22 22:40:49 Good morning from South Korea!
Celebrate @TeamUSA women’s gold medal at 6 on #WTHR..what a great scene!!
2032 2018-02-22 22:40:40 Thanks!
2033 2018-02-22 22:40:39 @MattJamilton @TeamShuster What are your favorite snacks and beer? I need to prepare for gold medal curling watch party. Please advise.
2034 2018-02-22 22:40:39 Can we like shootouts, but hate that it has to decide a Gold medal?  There’s plenty of occasions to see that move in the 4 years between Olympic years in @TheCWHL.
2035 2018-02-22 22:40:37 Shame on you @DLoesch for claiming the media loves "crying white mothers as ratings gold".  If you really felt that way, why didn't you have the balls to say it last night while you were defending the indefensible?  Those kids were NOT fooled by your BS.

2038 2018-02-22 22:40:26 #ScrewYou @DLoesch The media LOVES mass shootings?! "Crying, white mothers are ratings GOLD?" What a horrid POS you are, along with @NRA. Such a STUPID, RACIST statement. Who RUNS this country @GOP? CLEARLY, its @NRA.#KillTheNRA #BlueWave2018 #Resist
2039 2018-02-22 22:40:26 @DLoesch You coward! Why didn’t you make your “crying white mothers are ratings gold” speech last night to those mother’s faces. Because you’re a coward. Fuck you!
2040 2018-02-22 22:40:23 I love my friends and family so much and all the artists I love and I love nature and the weather and the winter and the Olympics and my mutuals and the sun and I hate school atm but it’s all fine since I’m surrounded by gold
2041 2018-02-22 22:40:22 Poor sportsmanship. Of course you go all in wanting the Gold medal but making the olympics is a great feat. Only the best get in and she should be proud to represent.  Girls look up to these women and she should show her pride not her disappointment.
2042 2018-02-22 22:40:21 Reporting on Hockey results is what causes shame in the athletes.  Everyone else "wins silver", hockey players "lose the gold".  They are awesome and should be celebrated.
2043 2018-02-22 22:40:19 I have a lot of respect for ambulance community first responders. When I attend a job in the ambulance like the one I attended today in Surrey, their early attendance makes all the difference. They are worth their weight in gold.   @SECambulanceCFR #ChainOfSurvival

2046 2018-02-22 22:40:13 For those just getting off work, they are in third period of replay of U.S.-Canada gold medal hockey replay on NBCSN. Still overtime and shootout to go.
2047 2018-02-22 22:40:13 ええ！？どうなんだ！貴様はこのままで良いってんだな！！
2048 2018-02-22 22:40:08 I completely agree with you. If you don’t want to run the risk of winning anything but gold, then don’t compete in the Olympics. Quite embarrassing.
2049 2018-02-22 22:40:06 US Olympic athletes, I hope u were all watching Canada’s women’s hockey team medal ceremony. THAT’s how u react to a silver medal! Gold or nothing! #firstloser

2052 2018-02-22 22:40:05 Dana Loesch, NRA spokeswoman: "Many in legacy media love mass shootings.... "I'm not saying that you love the tragedy but I am saying that you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold."
2053 2018-02-22 22:40:04 Sombra: We can’t handle the gold! Things can you somewhere else.

2058 2018-02-22 22:39:51 Mass shootings are ratings gold you say? Perhaps each sale of a weapon puts money in YOUR pocket. Quit the acting, no human is that cold hearted and shameless. We’ve seen your background, and it appears you will say anything for a buck.
2059 2018-02-22 22:39:51 “Many in the legacy media love mass shootings,” she said. “You love the ratings,” she explained. “Crying white mothers are ratings gold.” The Worst Human of the Week award goes to Dana Loesch
2060 2018-02-22 22:39:49 It fits better than ‘Diamonds’, ‘Symbol’, ‘Come’, ‘Gold’ and ‘Chaos’ which, somehow, seem to belong together and seem more ‘NPG’ than ‘New Power Soul’. It’s not his most popular or his best, but that ‘dark energy’ you talk about would make it not a million miles from ‘Batman’.
2061 2018-02-22 22:39:46 Learning opportunities from Netflix (who knew it was possible?!).....nuggets of leadership gold from the very best @BarackObama. Basic values (from his mother)..'Be honest, be kind, be useful, be responsible, work hard and treat everyone with respect' just genuine wisdom.
2062 2018-02-22 22:39:46 Big congrats to girls @usahockey for GOLD! #TeamUSAwomensHockey

2064 2018-02-22 22:39:41 Great game, penalties were one sided mostly, shootout in Olympics is disturbing, may as well flip a coin, no gold but yous truly deserve it, stay proud,
 we are of team Canada
2065 2018-02-22 22:39:41 So the @arkellsmusic are at the Olympics. Permission to petition the Olympic board to give all of you guys gold medals for blessing the world with sweet, sweet music!
2066 2018-02-22 22:39:40 @DLoesch You are a heartless bitch. You held your tongue last night and tried to tell them all it was someone elses fault but today you say crying white mothers are gold? You piece of shit. Yoi are a shameful trashy bitch. Your poor kids.

2071 2018-02-22 22:39:26 CCanadian Olympic Women’s team did great have to start thinking #nomoreshootout when it comes to a gold medal game
2072 2018-02-22 22:39:24 I don’t even know what happening here, but this gif is gold!
2073 2018-02-22 22:39:18 I do a podcast that generates listeners and money. And I believe you have no agenda and nothing to lose.  I also believe that’s called ROCK BOTTOM.  Now go listen to some therapeutical music because your brain needs a rest.
2074 2018-02-22 22:39:16 You are a disgrace, how dear you stand in front of your crowd and say white mothers crying on TV is ratings gold, disgusting but I don’t expect better from you anyway. Children are dying from GUNS and instead of having a rational conversation you all are playing on emotions#SHAME
2075 2018-02-22 22:39:12 Super stoked the USA women’s Olympic hockey team won gold, but to have it end in a shootout? I think we all know it was a classic. Bring the NHL players back to the Olympics
2076 2018-02-22 22:39:06 Love the videos of the Women’s Olympic Hockey team after winning gold last night getting absolutely slammed!

2083 2018-02-22 22:38:42 #danaloesch ?? “Crying White Mother’s is Ratings Gold”??? Are you out of your mind? Why didn’t you express those thoughts at the #CNNTownHall wiith those families you’re a sick white woman!!!! Sick!!!
2084 2018-02-22 22:38:42 NRA Spokeswoman: "Crying white mothers are ratings gold"  ...um, wow.
2085 2018-02-22 22:38:40 @HC_Women so proud of the game you played against the US. Not Gold but Silver is damn good. I was, however, extremely disappointed in your display while accepting the medal. Few people make it to the Olympics. Your game might not need work but your sportsmanship does.
2086 2018-02-22 22:38:37 That was an amazing run to Gold ladies! You made the USA so proud! Loved every minute of that entire game especially the overtime goal! Best ever! 
2087 2018-02-22 22:38:36 That's twitter gold
2088 2018-02-22 22:38:33 Yeah see, silver in the belts was the smallest color and doesn’t conflict with the background. On lita the pink is the smallest but wouldn’t look good on the red background. So for razor I’m kind of thinking gold but that’s a tough call because it’s close to skin color

2092 2018-02-22 22:38:24 @Allie874 Do you have a box score or other stats from the gold medal game? I'm having a really hard time finding anything.

2097 2018-02-22 22:38:19 Just my opinion, but ending a gold medal Olympic game in a shoot out is nonsense.  There's no need for it, and nothing is more exciting than sudden death overtime.  #endshootouts
2098 2018-02-22 22:38:17 Gold scar spotted

2102 2018-02-22 22:38:08 Sitting here watching Access on CBS and seeing the Canadian Hockey players be such sore losers, PITIFUL. If the US took Silver rather than gold they wouldn’t have been crying and taking off their medals. #SoreLoser #growupgirls
2103 2018-02-22 22:38:05 @greatwestlifeca What is happening w/the new changes GWL is making & not advising those who have their monies invested w/ GWL as it relates to their Gold Key financial advisors?
2104 2018-02-22 22:38:03 I avoided the internet all day so I could see the AMAZING #usawomenshockey team bring home the gold without knowing the results. GREAT GAME. #Merica #TeamUSA #USA
2105 2018-02-22 22:38:01 "Laissez vos enfants et votre mari"
2106 2018-02-22 22:37:58 I'm still not over how the gold medal was decided by a shootout.
2107 2018-02-22 22:37:53 Seems odd seeing us in red. I'd like the White one providing there's some gold trim on the shorts and socks.
2108 2018-02-22 22:37:50 “Crying white mothers are ratings gold?” WTH kind of thing is that to say @NRA ? #BottomFeeders
2109 2018-02-22 22:37:50 My father collects gold medals, and he gave some to me. He told me they're cheap, but he finds something charming about 'em.
2110 2018-02-22 22:37:49 Yeah but can she pass a degree? And more importantly can she neck a pint of Thatcher's Gold?
2111 2018-02-22 22:37:46 @CandyCrushSoda ok seriously why can’t u guys se that a lot of your customers want our gold bars out of the piggy bank for free. like we all work really really hard to get those stars and gold bars. why do you guys need to be such asses about this problem?
2112 2018-02-22 22:37:45 you are a cowardly sub-human witch, a paid hessian with no soul. How dare you say crying white mothers are ratings gold, disgusting.@DLoesch
2113 2018-02-22 22:37:37 Seasons 3-8 are gold
2114 2018-02-22 22:37:36 Props to the American Women's Olympic hockey team for their gold medal performance....whether its the Olympics,World Cup or everyday life..the truth is that American women are just badasses.The backbone of the nation. #TheBetterHalf
2115 2018-02-22 22:37:36 No comment but I hear the gold market is hot shit

2117 2018-02-22 22:37:31 U.S.-Canada women's gold medal hockey game now being replayed on @NBCSN.
2118 2018-02-22 22:37:31 “Crying white mothers are ratings gold.”

This is how the NRA feels about mass shootings.

This is why we need to stand up and fight against them.

Gun reform NOW!
2119 2018-02-22 22:37:26 Why the shootout is not taken out of a gold medal game is crazy! A game of that magnitude and you don’t let the players battle to the end. Brutal!!
2120 2018-02-22 22:37:25 Serious competition in the gold medal round!  Currently with the blue white and red French jersey - such a phenomenal dissection #JMIGOlympics
2121 2018-02-22 22:37:24 Sounds absurd because they are only 15 and 18 yrs old, but with the depth of young talent in Russia this will most likely be the only chance A.Zagitova and Y.Medvedyeva have at a gold medal at #Olympics. 1 night, tonight. @NBCOlympics
2122 2018-02-22 22:37:24 Wow. When speaking about the media at CPAC the NRA Spokeswoman Dana Loesch said that “Crying White mothers are Ratings Gold” saying that the media love mass shootings. How disgusting. Sad!

2127 2018-02-22 22:37:12 As a proud Canadian I’m very disheartened by this display of poor sportsmanship... however, she’s not the first player to have done this.... and with the pressure we seem  to put on these athletes to win Gold, she won’t be the last
2128 2018-02-22 22:37:04 Congrats to your sis on the Gold Medal. All of the USA is proud!!!!
2129 2018-02-22 22:37:04 This is gold lmaoooooo
2130 2018-02-22 22:37:03 A major fact in your story is incorrect. Shani is NOT the first black athlete to win gold in the Winter Olympics, that would be Vonetta Flowers.

2132 2018-02-22 22:37:00 Yeah, basically saying she's "abandoning" her child and saying she's a gold digger basically.

2136 2018-02-22 22:36:53 “Cry white mothers are ratings gold” is what the spokeswoman from the NRA said. She is a piece of work. Man screw them and their platform.
2137 2018-02-22 22:36:50 You don't 'win' a silver medal, you lose a gold. I would rather someone be so emotionally invested as opposed to 'just glad to be here'. #PlayToWin #TeamCanada

2154 2018-02-22 22:36:05 Crying white mothers are media gold this comes from an NRA representatives!

AU!
2157 2018-02-22 22:35:57 hey em don’t you think they should let us get our gold bars out of the piggy bank for free? we work really really hard to get those gold bars
2158 2018-02-22 22:35:54 Просто представьте моё сранное состояние от того что в аниме Такизава очень нравился
Потом смотрела как он плакал и сходил с ума потому что не хотел умирать 
Потом его убили
Но потом я узнаю что не убили

2159 2018-02-22 22:35:53 The shot Jocelyne Lamoureux used to win the US Women's Hockey team gold  is called the "Oops, I Did It Again". That and that alone will give me  the strength I need to keep going for the next four years. #Olympics
2160 2018-02-22 22:35:52 You’re embarrassing yourself and it’s pure gold.

2163 2018-02-22 22:35:49 I'm watching #USAvsCAN #Olympics  hockey game where #usawomenshockey won GOLD...its on @NBCSports now & been watching for little over an hour. I wanna watch it again & again & again! So proud of them! #USA #TEAMUSA 
2164 2018-02-22 22:35:48 I've seen NOVICE kids play 8 periods of hockey in one game at provincials.. no reason a gold medal game on the biggest stage should ever be determined by a shootout. IIHF needs to change this! Shame to see such a great game end that way

2178 2018-02-22 22:34:57 I want to just say what an amazing group of Women to work with and learn from!! It’s tough not achieving the Gold but these athletes learn from adversity and will continue to grow the game at a pace that is unmatched in the sport worldwide! Games like that truly inspire us!

2182 2018-02-22 22:34:49 se she even agrees with me. u guys need to let us get our gold bars out of the piggy bank for free. enough is enough
2183 2018-02-22 22:34:46 What a despicable thing for her to say. NRA spokeswoman says “Grieving white mothers are ratings gold for the legacy media” There’s a hot corner of hell for someone who utters these words.
2184 2018-02-22 22:34:35 @TylerIAm @ColeyMick if the USA wins gold for curling we need @allbusinesspete on the pod to discuss
2185 2018-02-22 22:34:34 only works on certain printers. my old baby is one of them and about 30% of the time it works so you need to use cheapo fabric! I have a nicky patch it managed to print once. It got a gold star for that!
2186 2018-02-22 22:34:33 For a lot of Canadians only gold will do in hockey.  It’s like football is the US.  We have a lot of pride behind it.   Not an excuse but just some understanding on how they feel.
2187 2018-02-22 22:34:31 um yes gold? um yes silver? X'DD :3c

2189 2018-02-22 22:34:24 I know what you mean I found the montana gold youtube channel, I personally don't think it looks like a marble effect  I bought the black one and added a thin layer of white to try and mute the starkness of the black but it's so messy

2196 2018-02-22 22:34:10 Been so busy getting platinums and shit I forgot about the US Curling team. Apparently we're in the gold medal match and I'll be watching tomorrow night hell yeah
2197 2018-02-22 22:34:07 Im happy the girls pulled it off but there should never be a shootout for the gold medal unless this is the junior goodwill games. #hendrixhockeyapparel

2217 2018-02-22 22:33:16 Trevor. Were you an adult in the early 2000's? Say 2000-2008? Remember the great recession? The wars? The largest single day market crash (until trump) in history? Auto industry crisis? Housing crisis? 
Obama inherited all that mess and fixed it. Trump inherited gold. He's a liar

2230 2018-02-22 22:32:32 She said in a NRA video regarding #parkland that “crying white mothers are ratings gold” which is so disgusting it makes me literally feel the heat rise in my cheeks.

2240 2018-02-22 22:32:04 Will always have a lot of love for black and gold on a Ferrari
2241 2018-02-22 22:32:03 Just let me know when you decide. 
2242 2018-02-22 22:32:02 The IIHF needs to get rid of shootouts. A gold medal game decided by a break away contest? In baseball a tie at the end of the 9th isn’t decided by a Home Run Derby. Football doesn’t do a field goal contest. A team sport should not be decided this way. Let them play it out.
2243 2018-02-22 22:32:00 Imagine having such a void sense of humour that you laugh at someone shaking items that were name dropped in a song. Fucking comedy gold.

2246 2018-02-22 22:31:36 @PotbellyGamers @YasirRaja Oh forgot to mention. USA beat Canada in Mens Curling this morning. and USA will face Sweden in the Gold Medal Game.
2247 2018-02-22 22:31:35 Did I hear this correctly... “You just got your Gold Toes in” . Please don’t be serious
2248 2018-02-22 22:31:35 lmao, miss you wyatt comedy gold
2249 2018-02-22 22:31:33 Agree personalised plans with right package of care ready to go is the gold standard.  Which in my role I have not intention to replace, but we can be there in crisis at any hour when things do not go exactly to plan and help ensure continuity of care without gaps.
2250 2018-02-22 22:31:32 I just look at these sad little photos of Zach and hear that song “.... all by myself, don’t wanna be all by myself anymore..” I  some LOVELY person with a  of gold realises they could turn Zach’s life around .

2265 2018-02-22 22:30:53 Super stoked the USA women’s Olympic hockey team won gold, but to have it end in a shootout? I think we all know it was a classic. Bring the NHL players back to the Olympics and you will have more than just the final game being a classic. #justsaying
2266 2018-02-22 22:30:52 for an ideology that spends so much time talking about praxis there really doesn't seem to be a lot of praxis going on with ancaps. maybe some of them but gold or Bitcoin or AR-15's or something. but ancaps who are interested in praxis seem to become agorists pretty quickly
2267 2018-02-22 22:30:52 I like how they've taken away a lot of the white (with Santander gone) and made it look like the F2007 & F2008 again. Gold wheels do look nice though.

2290 2018-02-22 22:30:00 Dedicated? Gold medal watch part 4am EST boys.....you got what it takes??
2291 2018-02-22 22:29:55 Similar to when Barack Obama was called America's No. 1 gun salesman, CNN, MSNBC, and other media's ham-handed, hyperbolic anti-2nd Amendment propagandizing is fundraising gold for the NRA and political manna from heaven for Donald Trump.
2292 2018-02-22 22:29:54 @CraigPravata hahahaha wins one gold and thinks they own us, what happened at world juniors?
2293 2018-02-22 22:29:53 Lol nah that real go gold or fuck that shit nobody remembers the second place
2294 2018-02-22 22:29:48 今日は〇〇買ってきたからなー
〇〇せなあかんからなー
などなど陣内のネタ冒頭を独り言で喋ってると人生楽しくなるよ
2295 2018-02-22 22:29:38 Gold, Tom. Gold.
2296 2018-02-22 22:29:34 The new @Hersheys Gold candy bar is ridiculously tasty. I love peanut butter - like serious, full-on "I want to share eternity with you" kind of love. This is not a PB bar, per se, but if you dig PB, I'm betting you will dig this. Minor criticism: It could be crunchier.
2297 2018-02-22 22:29:30 ATTI: #ML06gold Gold VV Bus 101 on the Gold VV is at Towers:2/22/2018 5:29:26 PM Next stops Mntneer Station, West Run, and Indep. MHP.
2298 2018-02-22 22:29:29 Never lose sight of the gold in you.
2299 2018-02-22 22:29:26 A man assaulted and threatened with a gun on the Gold Coast overnight. Gun fired, but the bullet missed victim. Crime scene set up at Nerang home, police are investigating.

2301 2018-02-22 22:29:26 Hey @EAMaddenMobile You should make a program elite player pack set where you trade in one elite player and like 5 or 10 gold program players to get a program elite from any program this year
2302 2018-02-22 22:29:25 I feel like this is @Shoostie2010 and team @TeamShuster carrying USA to the GOLD! Who wouldn't trust this team?!
2303 2018-02-22 22:29:23 Of?
2304 2018-02-22 22:29:20 また名無しは訓練をサボったのか…はあ…
2305 2018-02-22 22:29:17 I just made a deal with Kylie that when she wins gold in the Olympics one day for gymnastics, that I'll be rushing the stage to give her a bunch of really embarrassing kisses! She said "deal" so I'm pretty sure that's legally binding!  #Gymnastics #CrazyAunt
2306 2018-02-22 22:29:13 Those baldy photos on Facebook are absolute gold
2307 2018-02-22 22:29:12 Hey, @NBCSports maybe don't interrupt this replay of possibly the most thrilling gold medal game of the Olympics. Just a thought.
2308 2018-02-22 22:29:11 The Adekunle Gold magic 
2309 2018-02-22 22:28:49 At least we didn’t walk all over their flag like the Americans did once. There’s a big rivalry between Canada and USA and this time theAmericans were the better team. I was disappointed on how  played. Kudos to the gold medal winners.
2310 2018-02-22 22:28:48 non je suis deg j'etait a fond la j'avais de quoi bouffer boire et tt, c'etait encore mieux qu'un film deg que se soi fini  toi on te signale pour de la nuditer mais pas pour se vincent qui leche le cul au pauvre personne dans la rue avec sa carte gold et de la bouffe
2311 2018-02-22 22:28:42 Look forward to applauding a serious tragedy and the loss of life when it happens to you that could be some ratings gold
2312 2018-02-22 22:28:42 Booooooooooooom @JoeK147 this guy must have some insider info on these bits of gold dust
2313 2018-02-22 22:28:39 Yeah I know I'm kidding lol
2314 2018-02-22 22:28:38 (ピンク使ってます。)
2315 2018-02-22 22:28:38 I’ll go back to the curling replay. I’m watching this women’s gold medal replay now. Third period just started on @NBCSN. If you missed it, I highly recommend settling in.
2316 2018-02-22 22:28:36 we've struck gold with this kit!
2317 2018-02-22 22:28:25 I have the memory of a gold fish and I've seen so many races XD
2318 2018-02-22 22:28:20 excuse me i hadnt updated my coldflash fic since august and i just finished it i deserve a gold star
2319 2018-02-22 22:28:19 Dang, LV1 Gold Crown is possible

That's pretty mindblowing, especially for how long this game has been out
2320 2018-02-22 22:28:19 Gold has such a special luster to it. I happened 38 years to the day after USA 4 USSR 3 in Lake Placid. To this day I still get the chills watching that last minute play out and I know that the members on this team will also from now on when they watch this replay.
2321 2018-02-22 22:28:18 Also, I feel like Lois Lane is probably the gold standard of civilian love interests (notwithstanding my love for MJ). That's a lofty goal to aim for.
2322 2018-02-22 22:28:06 Just played: Gold Class - Twist In The Dark (Drum)

SONYは色がいい…
2327 2018-02-22 22:27:57 Nothing puts the women's gold medal game in perspective like getting a call from the care facility during OT because your MIL with advanced Alzheimer's has left her room and is wandering the hallways terrorizing other residents. Sigh. So today we're looking at the secure ward. :(
2328 2018-02-22 22:27:55 A toothache so I'm on the Gold Coast train to see my dentist in Robina, hope it's fixable!
2329 2018-02-22 22:27:54 Queen bee ... silver with a touch of gold... Keum boo!
2330 2018-02-22 22:27:53 All her parodies are gold. THIS literally shaped me and my humor as a teen. Coldmirror is the german YouTube queen and everyone knows that.
2331 2018-02-22 22:27:52 I just finished teaching a 5 week course on seeing in the spirit. Great sense of the Holy Spirit, gold supernaturally appearing on people, seeing angels, feeling invisible objects, wind ect.
2332 2018-02-22 22:27:51 Just in case last night wasn't enough or you missed it, gold medal game on NBCSN 
2333 2018-02-22 22:27:51 Did you steal their Christian Science gold?
2334 2018-02-22 22:27:50 yay! thank you beshyyyy! go for the gold! HAHA na sa DO na po kayo niyan?
2335 2018-02-22 22:27:47 Gold Fish ka talaga kuyaaaaa 
2336 2018-02-22 22:27:47 Everyone is complaining about the replays of Canada winning the gold in 2014 but does anyone know how many times the 2012 semi’s are replayed whenever a mention of Canada v USA happens in woso?
2337 2018-02-22 22:27:46 Please don’t blow my vibe, that’s like turning Gold to bronze omg.. 
2338 2018-02-22 22:27:45 I keep a pork pie hat and homemade gold VW hood ornament chain on-hand for just this problem. Jeans, shirt and retro sneakers and I can be Mike D in 5 minutes.
2339 2018-02-22 22:27:45 Football can be kind or cruel. Athletic wander their way into the next round of the Europa League, having struck gold in a strange first half in their first leg. Villarreal plug away over two legs and get nowhere.

2341 2018-02-22 22:27:42 So if I placed in gold from placement matches, i have to de-rank to silver to get those to count?
2342 2018-02-22 22:27:37 I'm ranting but it's pure gold
2343 2018-02-22 22:27:37 الصحبة الصالحة هي تلك التي تجعلك تعـيش حياتين، واحدة هنا، والأخرى في الجنة فقط إمنح التسامح والمغفرة حق وسيظل الصديق مثل أول مرة
2344 2018-02-22 22:27:25 Guaranteed silver is already history, right? No matter what happens, the men of #TeamShuster are already in the history books. They have represented the USA well. I wish them well. Sending gold medal vibes!
2345 2018-02-22 22:27:23 You’re more than right, garbage way to decide a gold medal game!!

2350 2018-02-22 22:27:12 Congratulations US Men’s Curling team on your victory over Canada. Now you curl for the Gold. Ain’t that something?! Wow!
2351 2018-02-22 22:27:12 Third period of last night's gold medal game just now starting on NBCSN 

YES and PLEASE
2352 2018-02-22 22:27:11 Hi Karen! I am interested in buying gold. I am a successful doctor with lots of cash. Thank you.

2360 2018-02-22 22:27:02 @ChristaDelcamp Well congratulations. NBC10. Great Move Bringing this champ back to NBC. There has been a handful of true Professionals in this tough market. Christa is the Gold Standard of News Anchors. Best of luck Christa delighted for you and the network.
2361 2018-02-22 22:26:59 Yep, gold.
2362 2018-02-22 22:26:59 I couldn't agree more.. Skyline sucks.. Dixie chili blows it out of the water, with gold star also being way better.
2363 2018-02-22 22:26:56 Oh no, I loved the one that no one else talks about, Gold against the Soul

2367 2018-02-22 22:26:49 Although we do our best to avoid this... Upgrades and interruptions may occur on nights and weekends. It's pretty rare... But we do know how you feel :( Missing a gold medal game is not fun at all... ^DD
2368 2018-02-22 22:26:48 Germany is a super wildcard. Hopefully that guarantee's us a spot in the finals. It sucks that the women lost to USA though for gold in shootout >.> I don't think shootout should be a thing in a gold medal game.
2369 2018-02-22 22:26:45 I forgot I even watched this . This was anime gold
2370 2018-02-22 22:26:45 Doubly cynical because mass shootings are really gold for the gun biz. If they didn’t get press the gun biz wouldn’t get that sales bump.
2371 2018-02-22 22:26:44 @HockeyCanada Jocelyne Larocque should have her golden helmet taken away for her disrespect in the gold medal game.  A gold medal isn’t what the olympics are all about. Not to mention she already has one #poorsport #notcanadian

2375 2018-02-22 22:26:37 Gold Coast 600 é lendária, mas fracionar em duas baterias num evento importante do calendário sempre me pareceu um detrimento para a competição... ainda bem que o 1000km de Bathurst nm mudou.
2376 2018-02-22 22:26:35 I wonder if there has been another skater who won a world title as a Jr and the next yr a rook as a Sr won gold at the Olympics or took Worlds gold.

2382 2018-02-22 22:26:26 lrt: wow I can't believe its finally possible holy fuck. Here I thought Gold Crown would be impossible to get in true lvl 1 crit. This is honestly great!
2383 2018-02-22 22:26:25 Jajaja buena esa y seguro dice que ahorras porque Plus es más caro que Gold y porque te cobran 1€ por suscribirte y por comprar. También ahorras entonces por tener que meter por la fuerza 5€ a tu cuenta para poder comprar un juego de 2€
2384 2018-02-22 22:26:19 That’s ridiculous. Nobody, including Canadians, is entitled to gold. They lost. Plenty of people who lost prior to that last game would be thrilled with silver. Sore sport & embarassing. #womenshockey #GrownIsh
2385 2018-02-22 22:26:17 These are gold! I’ll finish when I get home!
2386 2018-02-22 22:26:10 oh then just devolve your gold to reg numemon and run 3 of those in the main team
2387 2018-02-22 22:26:08 Wispa Gold is worth a look too
2388 2018-02-22 22:26:06 Courtland Sutton intrigues me from SMU and Calvin Ridley should be a nice player, but I agree. Nobody jumps off the tape.

2390 2018-02-22 22:26:03 One gold and 3 silvers at #dbaDEA this year. It’s been a true honour to research and write these winning stories for @MWorldwideLDN, @pearlfisherlive, @creativeleapuk. Hope we can do it all over again for 2019!
2391 2018-02-22 22:26:00 Homestly, the US women’s shootout shots probably would’ve won the men’s gold bc all of the men’s shots were awful

2402 2018-02-22 22:25:30 I think Starflyer is limited edition? But I saw it and desperately needed it. I also have the red and the gold, planning to get the black iridescent one for maximum sparklegoth
2403 2018-02-22 22:25:27 Jan, you are so courageous, we applaud you! You deserve a dozen of gold medals for speaking up. I hope you continued to do so. You maybe more free to talk about it after the Olympics and I hope more athletes come forward. Thank you for being you.
2404 2018-02-22 22:25:26 Guys a class of 50 pupils sit to write an exam, they all pass that makes them winners, in addition to them all passing (while writing the exams) their are incentives(Gold, Sliver, Bronze medals) by achieving Gold doesn't mean the rest are losers, unless they have cheated.

2406 2018-02-22 22:25:19 Only the #NRA spokeswoman #DanaLoesch would refer to #ParklandShooting as #MSM gold without mentioning how much the NRA makes off murdered innocent school children in new gun sales after mass shootings or reference how much the NRA pays elected officials. #CPAC2018
2407 2018-02-22 22:25:17 How is that poor sportsmanship? They came to win gold and didn't achieve that goal. I applaud the new Canadian attitude. You loving hunting I have ZERO respect for you.
2408 2018-02-22 22:25:17 Still in shock over the incredible relay performance from the Belarus girls today, all well deserved gold medalists! I really hope this doesn't lead to Darya and Skardino contemplating retirement, but what a way to go out if it turns out to be the case! #Biathlon

2419 2018-02-22 22:24:49 I thought most/all of the benefits were listed on the website. I believe the AA Plat Challenge just ended. I don't follow that closely. Caesars was renewed (I do follow that closely). Most of the usual suspects (Hilton Gold). I guess, I should take a glance again.
2420 2018-02-22 22:24:40 Omg, just seen @TiffanyHaddish meet @Oprah on @TheEllenShow.  HILARIOUS!  Also made me want to tear up a bit.  Those 3 together are pure gold!

2427 2018-02-22 22:24:25 I talk about my love of women's hockey A LOT so some of my coworkers were like "You must have loved watching the US win gold last night!"

Oh, I love the win; seriously it's a fairytale ending after all the boycotting and negotiations this year...but I didn't get to see it 
2428 2018-02-22 22:24:22 I’ll request that my digital radio is in muted gold.

2430 2018-02-22 22:24:19 USA hockey has been preaching about making sure kids are participating in multiple sports for years, many multi sport athletes on the team and they won gold.

2439 2018-02-22 22:23:49 They are longtime rivals but I think the Canadian player reacted like that cause that’s what happens when you’ve won gold 4 Olympics in a row. You come to expect to win gold and anything less is unacceptable.
2440 2018-02-22 22:23:48 Maaaaybe only being allowed to retro J's in black and white with gold hits is getting old?

2451 2018-02-22 22:23:17 They will more than likely turn from that to the honey gold color that all our dogs have!
2452 2018-02-22 22:23:15 I wish I could say I lost my voice screaming for the USA women’s hockey gold but no, I just lost my voice by existing this week. RIP my vocal cords.

2459 2018-02-22 22:23:07 A few girls and I meet once a month and we call it a “think tank” meeting. When we first started meeting we all felt like there was more to life than what we were currently doing and we all wanted to start our own business or be successful at something besides our jobs..
2460 2018-02-22 22:23:05 Ahh, I see.  So by your logic, the women's Olympic Hockey gold medal was won by South Korea.  Won BY an American team, but they were IN South Korea.
2461 2018-02-22 22:23:01 Arnold Boldt rewrote the
history books during an astonishing career that saw him win Athletics gold
medals at 5 successive Paralympic Games
2462 2018-02-22 22:23:00 now you've dragged me down with you and i have to acknowledge out loud that i'm a longtime ice dance follower - i love meryl davis and charlie white, the sochi gold medalists :)
2463 2018-02-22 22:22:58 She has raised the bar so high that now she's expected to have such results week in, week out on the WC circuit. If she doesn't you'd hear "fluke gold".
2464 2018-02-22 22:22:55 #YoungOffenders is absolute gold!
2465 2018-02-22 22:22:53 Many academic staff have very privileged lives and gold plated unsustainable pensions. They are striking and putting young people’s exams at risk. Young people need to realise this is Labours socialism at work.
2466 2018-02-22 22:22:50 It’s so annoying hearing some girls complaining about guys. I try to introduce you to a good guy, and of course he is shut down before even meeting him. He is such a good friend and person in general. He literally treats his mom, sisters, friends, and all women like gold.
2467 2018-02-22 22:22:49 Viviane Forest is a 2 time

2468 2018-02-22 22:22:43 should be good you tend to turn out gold 
2469 2018-02-22 22:22:42 Only way I can stay awake to watch @TeamShuster win gold live is napping, coffee, and prayers. #TeamUSA #Curling
2470 2018-02-22 22:22:34 longest day ever. That game last night was  Those girls worked so hard for that win, and for so many this was probably their last chance for a gold
2471 2018-02-22 22:22:34 Victor Moses is a good player. 
Luckily for them Chelsea got him back before he struck gold with a better team.

2501 2018-02-22 22:21:29 a little ticked off by the Canadian Womens Ice Hockey coach in the gold medal game. The American coach out coached her easily. You cant run your top players into the ice by the third period then expect the 6th D and fourth line to dominate in the third period and expect to win.
2502 2018-02-22 22:21:28 When is the gold medal match?
2503 2018-02-22 22:21:23 My intel suggests today's Benalla meeting should be a gold mine for punters, expecting a few go OFF  today....

2512 2018-02-22 22:21:04 NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said Thursday that the media exploits mass shooting to capitalize on ratings. “Many in legacy media love mass shootings,” Loesch said. “I’m not saying you love the tragedy, but you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold.”
2513 2018-02-22 22:21:04 Gold medal seems about right without actually figuring it out. 6 GM of gold plate over silver

“Many in legacy media love mass shootings...” “You guys love it. Now I'm not saying that you love the  tragedy. But I am saying that you love the ratings. ... Crying white  mothers are ratings gold.”

What must it be like being the literal lipstick on the NRA's pig?

2543 2018-02-22 22:19:40 You're also in denial and seem to have intentionally avoided discussion of the genocide of non-state, peaceful tribes like the Taino and Arawak in Hispaniola and Cuba. No hospitals or schools there, just gold mines and plantations run by slaves.
2544 2018-02-22 22:19:37 Just told Phil to remind her, haha #gold

2547 2018-02-22 22:19:33 Yeah agents are hilarious. I remember three months after I started one of my agents at the time came up to me wasted saying “you must have a pussy of gold bc you arent supposed to be here” umm thanks agent!

2556 2018-02-22 22:19:08 America talks a lot of shit after one gold medal, in one sport, which they lost the past 4 Olympics. we continue to dominate in overall medals and overall gold medals, with way less athletes, and way less population. 
and we also have gun control.
2557 2018-02-22 22:19:07 Simple tip: Gold Fahrmann is better 
2558 2018-02-22 22:19:05 If it's not good enough for the Stanely Cup final why is it acceptable for the Olympic Gold Medal game.  Hockey is hockey. Championship is championship. Winning a gold medal that way is ridiculous!
2559 2018-02-22 22:19:05 @Buccigross If @TeamShuster wins gold in curling you owe me a sweatshirt, if not I buy one.
2560 2018-02-22 22:19:03 i earned a gold medal in the petty olympics

2562 2018-02-22 22:18:58 I just took the hardest fall of my life, but I didn't drop the burrito that was in my hand...So...Do they send my gold medal right to me or do I have to go pick it up somewhere?
2563 2018-02-22 22:18:57 “Thank you for your service.” is a hard movie for me to watch I’m not even halfway through and it hit me. Smells the damn smells the come back. I could watch so many other movies. Like American Sniper, Lone Survior, Black Hawk Down but this movie got to me. Anyone else affected?

2567 2018-02-22 22:18:46 @RiotSupport what's up with coin not displaying the gold income properly
2568 2018-02-22 22:18:44 She has two sons.  Maybe she will be ratings gold one day.  I hope not, but maybe.
2569 2018-02-22 22:18:42 I like to pair ‘England’ from that album with ‘Australia’ by @laurajeanmusic and ‘America!’ by Bill Callahan for the self-loathing tour. I agree, ‘Let England Shake’ is gold, all the way.
2570 2018-02-22 22:18:41 #canadahockey, #CANvsUSA. #Olympics I get it being competitive, but there is a winner & a loser of any game. USA went on that ice wanting Gold as much as CAN but we would not have been that disrespectful. We celebrated the silver 4yrs ago.
2571 2018-02-22 22:18:41 Well well well USA curling earned itself a medal!!! ? Could it be gold?
2572 2018-02-22 22:18:40 And it always disturbs me the absolute idiocy that garners millions of followers when there’s real gold out there with little to none.

I just started using YouTube for my audio interviews, but know that only a select few will ever listen. And I’m ok with that.

2574 2018-02-22 22:18:37 HAPPY 18TH BIRTHDAY to one of my favourite people ever. I'm so grateful for you, not many people get to see your real self, you have the biggest heart, a heart of gold & you always make me laugh. Even though you talk SHIT & stayyy SHOUTING me, I love you. @madhi_muhamm 
2575 2018-02-22 22:18:36 If the Canadian women had been good enough to win gold, they would have gold around their neck. Grow up. You got silver because you weren’t the best. Too bad it was a shoot out that won the game but rules are rules.
2576 2018-02-22 22:18:30 Small glimmer of hope for Evgenia fans: her personal best in the FS is 2.38 better than Alina's.  Evgenia will need to win the FS by 1.31 to take gold.  #PyeongChang2018

2579 2018-02-22 22:18:28 he'd look even better in black and gold 
2580 2018-02-22 22:18:24 You never know how a career is going to turn out but dear God I better don't hear anyone say "fluke Gold" when talking about Oeberg in the next 12/24 months. Probably *the* most consistent biathlete of Pyeongchang.
2581 2018-02-22 22:18:19 .....and the gold medal goes to........SPICY!!!! *Queue national anthem*

2587 2018-02-22 22:18:03 Give her a gold  !!
2588 2018-02-22 22:18:00 I usually try and ignore bullshit media stuff like this but that article is so disgusting, especially when we know Cheryl and we know that she’s an amazing woman with a heart of gold, it just makes me so angry to see shit like that written about her 
2589 2018-02-22 22:17:56 I understand the time and how it was a late game... but it's the GOLD MEDAL GAME. NBCSN only had 14 million viewers and CBC had 3 million for the game. That is atrocious!!
2590 2018-02-22 22:17:56 It is not fair to watch an exciting hockey game that late to lose gold  in a shootout!

2604 2018-02-22 22:17:22 For everyone that ripped that Swedish Jr player after losing gold ... Canada’s Jocelyn Larocque was just as much of a sore loser by refusing to wear the medal. So people. You either love or hate them both. This is when media and fans talk out of their _______’s

2620 2018-02-22 22:16:36 Imagina nós, escutando Costa Gold, deitados na areia da praia olhando o nascer do sol, tomando umas bira e conversando sobre o quão bom é aquele momento e que  queremos repetir isso até o final de nossas vidas

2630 2018-02-22 22:16:10 Although I understand Her disappointment at not winning gold her non-acceptance of the silver medal disrespects her opponents and disrespects the idea of sportsmanship. Winning isn’t everything

2734 2018-02-22 22:12:35 To me it doesn't matter if you win Gold or Silver. cause even if you lose. Its still a win win because you get a medal regardless.

2736 2018-02-22 22:12:33 #CryingWhiteMothers  Are Ratings Gold? #DanaLoesch the clearly racist and sadly jaded NRA spokesperson insulting the free press and black women with one broad stroke.
2737 2018-02-22 22:12:33 Everything that glitters ain’t gold.

2741 2018-02-22 22:12:20 The Trump Train nears Mueller's Gorge carrying to much Baggage and the Stolen Gold. Hustlers Bridge wasn't built to hold up  all that and #HuckaBS Too. Will our Fake Engineer be able to grease the tracks with NRA graft or are the Snakes on a Train doomed. Stay Tuned.

2745 2018-02-22 22:12:14 Finally getting to watch the us women's hockey team play Canada for the gold and my dad ruined it and told me how it ended. 
2746 2018-02-22 22:12:14 It’s a weird kind of torture knowing the US Women win the gold, but not knowing how. Translation: I am way to stressed about a hockey game that has already happened. #GoldMedalGame #USAvsCAN
2747 2018-02-22 22:12:12 @JannyMedvedeva You can do it, you're the best, go for the gold... <3  I support you from El Salvador

2749 2018-02-22 22:12:10 AH #QriketLive my phone died on the final round. Had 20 points and picked gold. Does any one know what place I came in or if I won anything? @MelissaMelottey @jcomparel

2751 2018-02-22 22:12:06 Yep, producer's fault- that's me. Was looking at Regan's congratulatory tweet and mixed up my gold medal Emilys.
2752 2018-02-22 22:12:05 Just watched the shootout for the USA women’s gold match, must say the winning goal in the shootout was nastyyyyyy
2753 2018-02-22 22:11:53 O-Due to the recent highway robbery the Bruins just committed on the Panthers getting a third round pick for Vatrano (who sucks), I believe it is part of something bigger. Folks expect Ryan McDonagh in black 'n gold by end of the week! Exciting things for the B's!
2754 2018-02-22 22:11:52 @evemuirhead hey you Anna  Vicky and Lauren buzzing good luck in semis such a good team bring back gold 
2755 2018-02-22 22:11:49 The worst shit games like the Witcher & elder scrolls do is try to make a fantasy world & then charge 20 gold for a fucking carrot

And a sword is 100 or w/e

Dude
2756 2018-02-22 22:11:45 Yes especially the gold medal game!
2757 2018-02-22 22:11:39 You manage to rummage through a garbage and bring gold,
2758 2018-02-22 22:11:38 Bing! But it’d have to be Australian-era Dazzler, with the blue and gold costume.

And yes, I’d love (lots of!) Jamie, but no-one’s made one :(
2759 2018-02-22 22:11:36 A woman isn’t a gold digger for wanting a man who is financially stable, or working towards it.
2760 2018-02-22 22:11:35 Whether Gold, Silver or Bronze, winning a Design Effectiveness Award is a fantastic achievement. Congratulations to our 54 winners #dbaDEA

'Many in legacy media love mass shootings. You guys love it. Now I’m not saying that you love the tragedy. But I am saying that you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you'"
2769 2018-02-22 22:11:15 Very proud of D for staying up so late last night watching the USA women's hockey team win gold that he was too tired to go to his own hockey game this morning. A true American.
2770 2018-02-22 22:11:15 Hockey is kinda a big deal in Canada, so for a lot of people if your not first your last and only gold matters.
2771 2018-02-22 22:11:15 Gold is the element of conservatism. The people of the Gold Tribe are capable of adapting to many things.

2788 2018-02-22 22:10:33 Bendis has done some outstanding work for Marvel (minus Civil War II, which was awful). I’m interested to see what he does. Tomasi and Gleason have been making comic gold for a long time. I’ll follow them anywhere.

2811 2018-02-22 22:09:30 Playoff format change is really fools gold man! Lmfaooooo! No team! And I repeat- NO FUCKING TEAM would stop the Rockets, Warriors, or Cavs from winning it all for the next 3-4 years. Sweeeeeeeeep!

2818 2018-02-22 22:09:09 Didn't watch gold medal game last night because of early work & general tiredness. Regret it immensely. I hope everyone was smarter than me.
2819 2018-02-22 22:09:08 From my experience, some children will say they have read books but have actually only watched the films, especially if the books are ‘hard’. Knowing each child & finding books they can read & enjoy is key. Librarians, reading teachers & LSAs are worth their weight in gold 
2820 2018-02-22 22:09:06 Rose gold is such a good color???
2821 2018-02-22 22:09:01 CONGRATULATIONS!!  You are Gold all the way!!!!

2825 2018-02-22 22:08:50 His arm got torn off at some point. He’d got a replacement arm soon after and I guess he’s upgrading soon to gold?
2826 2018-02-22 22:08:48 @pucknbass I'd love you to win, I know you'd give it to me anyways! :P I know gold isn't in your palette! 
2827 2018-02-22 22:08:47 Cudos for the win..Even though I'm from Toronto..A Gold Medal game should be Sudden Death.. Not a Shoot Out..
2828 2018-02-22 22:08:47 Det förutsätter att laget har kompetensen att spela sig in i gold zone (hysteriskt töntigt uttryck, by the way - obs, även det en subjektiv åsikt).
2829 2018-02-22 22:08:37 Liam Rosenior bang on about the mix of culture and experience in a top side. That's exactly why although he's not the best player at the club someone like Milner is worth his weight in gold and why he shouldn't be "binned" as the more over the top fan claims. #THEDEBATE
2830 2018-02-22 22:08:35 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared

2832 2018-02-22 22:08:32 .@KinneirDufort’s official case for @Raspberry_Pi has not only generated profits of £725,000, it’s opened up new ways to use the computer and has defined a visual identity for the brand. It wins them our final GOLD #dbaDEA
2833 2018-02-22 22:08:32 Team USA won the last 3 world games, why did she feel she was entitled to win gold?
2834 2018-02-22 22:08:30 I’m at the stage of being stoned where it’s completely okay to be drinking gold peak straight out of the 64 oz bottle
2835 2018-02-22 22:08:22 The United States Men’s Curling Team is gonna play for gold!
2836 2018-02-22 22:08:21 Stop being negative you have tons of people who love you and love is the only thing that really matters in this world AND you have a beautiful angel face AND gift that is your amazing voice AND you have a heart of gold
2837 2018-02-22 22:08:18 but its possible dat aunty maryam became an 'IT Expert' after being expelled from 2 medical colleges! or maybe she invented Calibri even before microsoft envisioned it!!!!
aunty maryam can do anything - she even has a gold medal in eloping!
2838 2018-02-22 22:08:17 B: Daddy!.....*he runs up and grabs you around the legs*  Upsies?
2839 2018-02-22 22:08:16 Last year I did too. I wanted a gold bag and they sold out. Not this year!  Goes to a great cause which I have witnessed first hand. Congrats on your recent battle as well.
2840 2018-02-22 22:08:15 Well its part of it...a lil bit though...when things r too smooth..it bcomes boring... u need small drama sumtimes....
2841 2018-02-22 22:08:10 My youngest daughter went through Daisies, Brownies, Scouts, Cadettes and in Seniors was finishing here Gold Award when she was hit by a car and through she has healed she never was able to finish her Award. Now my granddaughter is in Cadettes with a Bronze, Silver on the way.
2842 2018-02-22 22:08:09 This had nothing to do with the question but congrats on winning gold in woman's hockey. But it's sad that other country's are not that good
2843 2018-02-22 22:08:05 Nunca puse gold a una cuenta de peru, pero podria funcionar, aun asi yo juego el fifa 18 sin ningún problema con la EEUU online
2844 2018-02-22 22:07:58 Congrats Jocelyne Larocque & @HC_Women for great #WinterOlympics. As competitors we understand your disappointment. Read this story @StrikingSilver about a USA hockey team that won silver in 1972 to add perspective. Remember, you WON silver! You didn’t lose gold. @NBCOlympics
2845 2018-02-22 22:07:52 Hockey Gold!!! And against their arch rivals Canada!!!

2847 2018-02-22 22:07:50 Neither of them are today, which is all I care about at the moment. I think they're both early Saturday morning with the women's gold on Sunday
2848 2018-02-22 22:07:48 Red and gold are badass 
2849 2018-02-22 22:07:48 My bff is gold
2850 2018-02-22 22:07:39 “Crying White mother’s. Is rating gold” talk about racism.
2851 2018-02-22 22:07:38 What about the US? No congrats for winning the gold medal and beating the team from up north?
2852 2018-02-22 22:07:36 Aye yo ass got a $100 gold grill in yo mouth you always talking cheap shit

2854 2018-02-22 22:07:24 Can totally vouch for him he has a heart of gold, nothing but the finest driving
2855 2018-02-22 22:07:22 So you’re not blaming the use of arsenic and lead to mine for gold you’re blaming the people who had an accident trying to fix the problem, “conservative” logic strikes again.
2856 2018-02-22 22:07:20 @Eucerin @EucerinUS your standard demopurifier range is incredible... but my god why is it never in stock in the UK?! It's like gold dust! Even the internet is struggling with stock of it!

2860 2018-02-22 22:07:09 I know I'm a hater of the color pink but honestly this "rose gold" obsession and trend is out of control and it's gotta go.
2861 2018-02-22 22:07:08 Alright, so the plan is to finish White's main story tonight, get myself four Pokemon Trainer Club accounts, and hopefully get an Ultra Moon run going, just so I don't lose the Gold Bottle Caps from each event.
2862 2018-02-22 22:07:06 I've only just now realized Mr. Gold's name is Mr. Gold because Rumplestiltskin makes gold
2863 2018-02-22 22:07:05 You’re a second hand gold medal Olympian
2864 2018-02-22 22:06:54 Tessa it doesn't matter when you said it. Shoot-out in a Gold Medal game is ridiculous. Thank you for your insight & truthfulness.

2887 2018-02-22 22:05:51 Sometimes you tweet absolute 24k gold. This is one of those times.
2888 2018-02-22 22:05:51 Now "greedy"... FS Investors' partners have spoken highly of them (ethical, gold standard). We know the school does not have the money to play a 50/50. But good news! There is a good deal for all just waiting to be negotiated. Maybe stop name calling and get back to WORK? 
2889 2018-02-22 22:05:50 You know everything I touch it’s gold wit me

2891 2018-02-22 22:05:42 I love Magnolias. Even have them on decorative plates, a rug and gold bookends. Used to have one outside my bedroom window. Found out I'm allergic!  Moved. I love the smell of Gardenias but, they brown fast after clipping so, I put one bush outside my bedroom window.

2897 2018-02-22 22:05:29 Why is it that women soccer @ussoccer_wnt and women Hockey all show results by winning gold or world cup, but the men team @ussoccer_mnt don't do shit they should be making more money or paid more.

2905 2018-02-22 22:05:12 #Repect. (From a #CanadianInDC! #canada s #USA, but maybe not so much today! #CANvsUSA ) Congratulations. That is one perfect, gold medal goal.
2906 2018-02-22 22:05:09 Delays continuing on Red & Gold lines.
2907 2018-02-22 22:05:06 It's fools gold. Rockets/warriors/Cavs would annihilate everybody. The NBA would pile up more injuries(a 7 game series between Knicks and Portland). Fatigue, traveling is tiring, and it changes the history of the game. Ring arguments no longer work too.
2908 2018-02-22 22:05:01 THE GOLD SHEETS WERE NOT AN ACCIDENT
2909 2018-02-22 22:04:57 What time is the Gold Medal Curling?

What about the Women's Bronze/Gold?

Thx, can't check mysefl
2910 2018-02-22 22:04:56 Att spela sig in gold zone ökar sannolikheten för ett avslut som har ett högt målvärde. Att skjuta utanför straffområdet med många motståndare mellan mål och boll är har ett lågt målvärde.
2911 2018-02-22 22:04:55 Get the children to invent a new #winter sport and then write the instructions that competitors can use to win a gold medal #WinterOlympics
2912 2018-02-22 22:04:53 What the women accomplished last night/this morning is something more people should be talking about. Canada has won four consecutive gold medals
2913 2018-02-22 22:04:53 I was a Brownie and then bridged to Girls Scout  The values the I learned helped me to be the advocate I am today.  Both of my daughters went into scouting.  My oldest daughter went from Brownies to Scouts, Cadettes and Seniors  She earned the Gold Award and was a camp counselor.
2914 2018-02-22 22:04:51 Impeachment would actually be ratings gold. Just saying...

3018 2018-02-22 22:00:47 Question for anyone with some International hockey knowledge: How do those in Europe feel about Shootouts? Is this a North American thing that we all hate a Gold Medal being decided by a skills competition?
3019 2018-02-22 22:00:46 *we find him sitting quietly with his toys, playing alone*
3020 2018-02-22 22:00:46 Slv/miners massively underperforming as they are tied to inflation and TIP has diveraged from gold.IMHO If fed chair at next meeting pushes for bank deregulation increasing $velocity then gdx/gdxj can take off big otherwise underperform

3029 2018-02-22 22:00:32 @digthatgold how do you determine the amount of gold you win? Is it random or is the higher level you reach you win a bigger piece of gold?

3035 2018-02-22 22:00:13 Sorry you don’t feel so special. It’s like the gold is rubbing off me now. Falling like glitter into thin air, it’s Like you don’t see me the same now.
3036 2018-02-22 22:00:12 1818 theres gold up in them hills

2018 there’s titties up in them DM Rooms
3037 2018-02-22 22:00:11 @TeamUSA my Bellamy is so pumped that the women’s hockey team won gold after 20 years against Canada Just as pumped when he found out they have their own Bellamy on the team! #womenshockey #TeamUSA #GoldMedal
3038 2018-02-22 22:00:10 Please list the legislative accomplishments Bacon has had as a Congressman. Not co-sponsor they all do that, but what has he steered through Congress. Tell me his views on real issues, not photo ops. He had 1 bill get out of Conmittee - Gold Star Families.
3039 2018-02-22 22:00:10 When the USA and Canada met in the first round, Don Cherry said they looked like slobs heading into the rink. And the Canadian women looked like fashion models. Wonder how the old fool feels about slobs winning the gold. (The entire comment was stupid btw).

3042 2018-02-22 22:00:05 If an Olympic hockey final gets to the end of 4-on-4 OT with no winner, just give both teams a silver or gold (arguments either way on which) and call it a day. In the Olympics, we don't actually need a single winner. Ties are possible, so should be draws.
3043 2018-02-22 22:00:04 It’s funny how Canadians are being super salty about the officiating in the game last night. Do you not remember the last Gold Medal game?
3044 2018-02-22 22:00:03 In the Manitoba league () my buddy said they did that exact thing. Only when it got to 1 on 1 their team would pull the goalie every time. On another note props for the women’s gold. They are much faster than the  team. Canada needs to catch up!

3052 2018-02-22 21:59:51 I gave an Olympic update to my kinders today and showed a video of Shaun White winning gold. One of the girls said, “Miss Weidner he looks good!” She’s not wrong though.

3077 2018-02-22 21:58:57 @VikKjell As disappointed as I am that #TeamCanada won’t be playing #TeamSweden in the gold medal game, I bet it makes your decision on who to cheer for a lot easier than last years worlds. #goteamsweden #goteamcanada

3081 2018-02-22 21:58:55 What a load of crap!
3 months of rubbish.
It's bad enough we have to pay for playing online, we're then told that these games are worth £48!
Ea access is 20 a year and gives much better games... gold is twice the price.
I'd rather have 1 good game a month than 4 weak games.

3083 2018-02-22 21:58:51 There were 1800+ of your constituents standing outside and walking the halls under the gold dome trying to get answers on sensible gun laws. Why didn’t we see you?
3084 2018-02-22 21:58:50 On a humourous but still kinda depressing note the dudes we sit with in computing were arguing over whether silver or gold were gay colours and me and the lesbian I sit with were losing their minds
3085 2018-02-22 21:58:49 I’ve never heard a bad R.E.M. song...they’re just one of those bands that always puts out gold I guess
3086 2018-02-22 21:58:48 We had great ice dance pairs before them however the judges never wanted to reward the Canadian skaters with gold due to judging corruption....
3087 2018-02-22 21:58:46 Did you stay up to watch the gold medal game too?
3088 2018-02-22 21:58:45 Okay so my @duolingo app just updated and now there are crowns? What the heck is that supposed to mean? How do I tell which of my lessons are gold now?

From the ashes a fire shall be woken
A light from shadows shall spring
Renewed shall be blade dat was broken
The crownless again shall be king

3121 2018-02-22 21:57:29 Take that comment in context of the US/Canada women's hockey rivalry, and remember those two teams have been miles ahead of everyone else since its introduction to the Olympics. I still don't agree with her choice to remove the medal, but it's about more than "not winning gold."
3122 2018-02-22 21:57:29 @lindseyvonn: Congratulations on winning Olympic bronze medal! You could’ve won gold metal, if you had given better answer to CNN reporter’s got-you question!

3134 2018-02-22 21:57:06 We will have live results this weekend from the Meet of Champions. Also looking to do a feature interview with every single winner, so after picking up your gold medal make sure to stop by the media table and ask for MileSplit.

3142 2018-02-22 21:56:51 True. I haven't read much about EPA since they said they wouldn't pay damages for the spill they caused at Gold King mine. Guess they followed regulation guidelines.

3144 2018-02-22 21:56:46 That looks to me like a century's worth of gold medals given your current rate of 1 per 20 years! 
3145 2018-02-22 21:56:43 @lindseyvonn Congrats  on an amazing Olympic Career!  You are an inspiration.   Quick question, What brand of sunglasses. (Gold with green lenses) did you wear during the games !  I would love to buy them for my wife.

3149 2018-02-22 21:56:40 Jmbullion, provident metals, apmex.  Silver is probably more under priced than gold but it’s hard to pass up the shiny yellow.  Either one I think is a good hedge.
3150 2018-02-22 21:56:40 I'm listening to ABBA's Gold: Greatest Hits on my record player while loading my Polaroid camera and both player and camera are the same shade of baby blue and I feel like such 14 year old hipster trash and couldn't be happier about it

3156 2018-02-22 21:56:34 What about the fences? Where do the sell the jewelry and gold? How about targeting Cash for Gold shops ?
3157 2018-02-22 21:56:32 I’m sure they’d give you one of their gold medals  if it weren’t for the concern that wearing it would injure your neck further.
3158 2018-02-22 21:56:32 More like mass shootings are gold for the NRA. Mass shooting > gun control talks > panic of taking people’s guns away > buy more guns > repeat
3159 2018-02-22 21:56:29 He just did the job he was fucking supposed to do- show up- no gold stars for that- No one gives me rewards when I show up for my job each day to do what I am expected to- Rubio should be held to same standard
3160 2018-02-22 21:56:29 I bet it was worth staying up to watch the women win gold!
3161 2018-02-22 21:56:27 Because everyone needs both a gold AND a silver sparkle case! Well done!
3162 2018-02-22 21:56:27 the phantom menace alone is a gold mine

3175 2018-02-22 21:55:58 Well done, gold star for you, that's exactly what the US needs, MORE people carrying guns. You're CLINICALLY INSANE. For crying out loud resign & let American get back to some semblance of sanity.
3176 2018-02-22 21:55:56 although there is an abundance of gold and corals,knowledge is more precious
3177 2018-02-22 21:55:54 I saw an interesting interview about @swaysnt self made millionaire.. from flipping EverQuest accounts - to brokering wow gold. Now he runs a cryprocurrancy company.

3185 2018-02-22 21:55:38 Haha this is gold! 
3186 2018-02-22 21:55:38 Glenn this is absolute gold.
3187 2018-02-22 21:55:38 Congrats to the Canadian women in a valiant effort for the gold medal in the 2018 Olympics.Not one Canadian could have asked for more from the girls.They all should be very proud of their performance
3188 2018-02-22 21:55:36 Alright USA, time for you to get hype for curling! This is the best I've ever seen this US team play and they legitimately have a chance to get gold... IN CURLING!!!
3189 2018-02-22 21:55:35 I think native river, Johnson said last year he wished he had ridden him more aggressive last year which native responds to but also he has been campaigned for the gold cup rather than last year being campaigned for Hennessey and they fell into the gold cup. Really interesting
3190 2018-02-22 21:55:33 Hungary won a gold medal in a speed skating race. I'm in Budapest, cheering.
3191 2018-02-22 21:55:33 Baby you could be wrapped in Gold, your attitude still ain’t worth shit
3192 2018-02-22 21:55:30 Did he bother to congratulate the Silver and Bronze medalists? Gold is all Trump knows...#Sad
3193 2018-02-22 21:55:29 @colourcreativee Can you make Lapis Lazuli in layed with gold?
3194 2018-02-22 21:55:29 Haha..  this is gold!   thanks for sharing!
3195 2018-02-22 21:55:25 Agree. NO shootout should decide the gold or Stanley Cup. Play till the end even if it's 20 OT's. Tho I do love the 4 on 4 in OT.
3196 2018-02-22 21:55:23 You are missing our mixed curling gold winning couple as a choice
3197 2018-02-22 21:55:19 That girl seemed really nice... until she stole all my gold.
3198 2018-02-22 21:55:19 It must be the 1st time this has happened, they were always like gold dust in previous years. Let's hope it's as easy for us come October!
3199 2018-02-22 21:55:10 Canadian certifications (@GoldPlatCA): @maroon5, Wait Gold (40,000).
3200 2018-02-22 21:55:08 Germany best Norway for the 10k Nordic gold with Austria third
3201 2018-02-22 21:54:55 In 1933 when the nation was in a devastating economic dislocation, the government asked for people to voluntarily let it buy back their gold. We could do the same for assault rifles. Some won't do it but if they are made illegal, people can't carry them around like goons.
3202 2018-02-22 21:54:55 And then calls grieving white mothers ratings gold the next day. She speaks to the audience. Sad and unfortunate.
3203 2018-02-22 21:54:51 People arent allowed to move? Keep delivering gold. This is the most fun i have had on Twitter in a long time.
3204 2018-02-22 21:54:46 When you really think about it, porn stars are just gold diggers for the general public
3205 2018-02-22 21:54:41 She didn’t say that she said that it’s gold for ratings not gold in general.
3206 2018-02-22 21:54:41 If you care about brand recognition among millennials, go to target. They have these shitty graphic t's for like 10 bucks. They just have big logo's on them. They sell like hotcakes cus nobody cares at $10. Sell t-shirts there. I'm giving you GOLD here.
3207 2018-02-22 21:54:40 Between yelling and jumping up and down for this and the Women's Hockey game, my voice is gone! Congrats!! Now finish the Swedes off and bring home the Gold !!!
3208 2018-02-22 21:54:33 Eww yungy you have a girl friend eww gold digger xD
3209 2018-02-22 21:54:31 Is this really a gold star, tho?
3210 2018-02-22 21:54:31 In the trolling world we live in, the most appropriate question to ask any #Olympics participant, besides a gold medal winner, is, "How disappointed should we be in you? "
3211 2018-02-22 21:54:29 very true, most believe that was the gold medal game
3212 2018-02-22 21:54:29 I just don’t think it should be used in gold medal game! It should be like NHL playoffs and keep going into OT till someon scores!

3221 2018-02-22 21:54:02 It bothers me that someone would disparage this humble servant of God.  No, I’m not upended because what matters to me is how humbly he lived.  But with all the evil in the world, this is the guy you want to go after, while you hold a gold rimmed goblet in your profile pic?
3222 2018-02-22 21:53:59 Tragically, of all the ways USA could've won women's hockey gold, it had to happen by shootout. #Olympics
3223 2018-02-22 21:53:57 If I had known you could win a gold medal in the olympics while being completely devoid of any athletic ability whatsoever, I might have tried it. 

Well played, curlers.
3224 2018-02-22 21:53:56 Sheesh. You win gold medals and still no respect. Mange tak for sharing this further proof of our country's ignorance! Please note that the lousy Confederate flag does NOT get an emoticon on Twitter!
             
3225 2018-02-22 21:53:55 You guys have been having some great calls, especially on the American gold.

Say, has anyone ever suggested a Nordic Triathlon: cross country, shooting and ski jumping?
3226 2018-02-22 21:53:52 They’re squeezing the bejeezing outta #Manafort & #Gates. Boys better gold their tumbling routine & flip 4 their lives... or die in prison.

3241 2018-02-22 21:53:24 I’m still mad we lost gold to the Americans last night. I’m still mad at the US women’s hockey team since they stepped on Canadian flags during the Vancouver 2010 games. Don’t even @ me

3250 2018-02-22 21:52:54 Gold Wave sen harika bir programsın
3251 2018-02-22 21:52:54 You're wrong.  She isn't a champion.  The Canadian team has won gold the last 4 Olympics.  That's 16 years.  The silver medal winners never did what she did, they showed more class.  The IOC should not allow her to play again.
3252 2018-02-22 21:52:53 I'm not sure I understand the connection between an Olympic Silver Medal and a participation trophy. Sure, losing a gold medal game sucks, but a Silver Medal is not a participation trophy. Do you know Larocque? Why so passionate about this?
3253 2018-02-22 21:52:52 I totally respect teachers and all they do on a daily basis. Their work is far more than lesson planning and their day does not end when they leave the classroom. I give them much kudos! That said, that tweet is GOLD!

3279 2018-02-22 21:51:38 Just here to point out USA women’s hockey (Amanda Kessel) are gold medal Olympic champions
3280 2018-02-22 21:51:36 Stayed up late last night to watch USA women’s hockey team win gold. Now I’ll have to be up at 3am Saturday to watch men’s curling team to go for gold! 
3281 2018-02-22 21:51:35 Next Olympic gold should be decided by an OUTDOOR shootout for MAXIMUM GIMMICKS
3282 2018-02-22 21:51:34 All that glitters ain’t gold, and all that shines bright ain’t a diamond.
3283 2018-02-22 21:51:34 Great. But what the hell is it called? Trust me I’m bored and have been giving it some thought! BTW- your colors are Black/Maroon with gold trim.

3299 2018-02-22 21:50:52 so basically does she mean that the mother who was asking her questions yesterday who lost her son in florida was rating gold shame on her and hope her children realize what kind of monster she is
3300 2018-02-22 21:50:44 He could have his dad put all the gold he skimmed off the weekly cleanup back that would get him closer.

3312 2018-02-22 21:50:28 @realDonaldTrump Sadly I'm happy that the Trump hater Lindsay Vonn did not get her gold  and didn't even finish the Combined. The Trump hex strikes again.
3313 2018-02-22 21:50:27 Nikt nie oskarża Tuska o wichury. Ale takie sprawy, jak zaprzaństwo w sprawie śledztwa smoleńskiego, Amber Gold, afera WAT, afera reprywatyzacyjna  i wiele innych afer, mogą mieć istotny związek z królem Europy, czyli pajacem Berlina i Brukseli.
3314 2018-02-22 21:50:26 NBC dragging NHL hockey while NHL hockey completely ignores the USA Women's Hockey gold medal win is the height of petty on both sides.
3315 2018-02-22 21:50:26 Case in point: Wanted to see Canada get the gold in men’s curling but they had to beat the US. Or like the Women’s Hockey gold medal game. Couldn’t they just have both gotten the gold? 
3316 2018-02-22 21:50:21 What about those women cross country skiers that won gold, 1st time ever fir the US. Was a awesome race.
3317 2018-02-22 21:50:21 Anyone who can explain why on earth I freak out (not even meaning it in a good way) whenever Havana is playing gets a gold medal ... Idek why I don't like the song, it's the same with sign of the times, still aint listened to that yet
3318 2018-02-22 21:50:19 Gracie Gold
3319 2018-02-22 21:50:16 Шикарно. В июне проверю)
3320 2018-02-22 21:50:12 I remember how excited I was,even as a little boy I understood the significance. And people forget,that was not the Gold Medal game. The US had to come off that emotional high of beating the USSR and beat Finland,a very good team in their own right,for the Gold.
3321 2018-02-22 21:50:09 I love heart of gold so much it is just so pretty
3322 2018-02-22 21:50:05 おはよう、あやの。
3323 2018-02-22 21:50:03 Sales increased nearly 50% and eleven new members of staff have been recruited in the 18 months since @4windsvineyard’s rebrand by #Denomination. The rebrand also wins GOLD #dbaDEA
3324 2018-02-22 21:50:00 Your just mad because we beat the W. Canadian hockey team for the gold medal (jk).  I do agree with you on the gun issue.  Our 2nd amendment gives us the right to bear arms.  It doesn't give us the right to bear military style assault weapons.
3325 2018-02-22 21:50:00 20 years. 20. FUCKING. YEARS. We have won the gold medal. And it’s all been tarnished by a single goal.
3326 2018-02-22 21:49:54 Lego Luge is a huge hit today.  Many members going for Gold!

3329 2018-02-22 21:49:46 why I let anyone treat me like shit before is beyond me - I know gold now, no way am I ever going back to bronze
3330 2018-02-22 21:49:45 I really think the Studio that pushes it can be Key. Marvel/Disney is pushing out gold even before the upcoming Summer Blockbuster season.
3331 2018-02-22 21:49:45 Reach for the Gold Top, past the whole milk. You know you want it.
3332 2018-02-22 21:49:43 Lmao BBC radio most requested live and Disney radio  they play bts song evry week..BTW mic drop of @BTS_twt use bgm on series of Netflix and NBA game and football game and recently they receive 2 gold in RIAA so STFU
#iHeartAwards #BestFanArmy #BTSARMY
3333 2018-02-22 21:49:39 Team USA was the better team by quite a bit. Gold medal should be a 5 game series! Canada and USA the only good teams on the womans side. That would be epic
3334 2018-02-22 21:49:37 Rewatching the gold medal game because HEY THE US WOMEN’S HOCKEY TEAM WON GOLD LAST NIGHT anywayyy still feel like @maddie_rooney35 is my hero

Are you competing for gold or something? Is there an Olympic games of irrationality you're a contender in?
3339 2018-02-22 21:49:16 Fucking gold lmao
3340 2018-02-22 21:49:12 The gold medal game will be 1:35 AM EST, Saturday (so late Friday night). No absence necessary 
3341 2018-02-22 21:49:07 From women's MMA I'd argue @BulletValentina, @jessicammapro, @CatZingano or @ClaudiaGadelha_. I suspect the first two at least may win gold soon enough, though.

3348 2018-02-22 21:48:42 Meeting your heroes is such a powerful experience. It can lead to you realizing that not everything that glitters is gold. It can also lead to you realizing that their success is obtainable because they too are only human.
3349 2018-02-22 21:48:41 *mocks your original tweet* too lazy to come up with some gold

Coincidence? Nope.
3354 2018-02-22 21:48:21 Showtime airs Miracle the same day the US Women's hockey team wins gold, weird.
3355 2018-02-22 21:48:16 He got tired of “We’re gonna use a retro J and make it white/black with gold accents.”
3356 2018-02-22 21:48:09 I appreciate her passion, actually.  If you are a small country and get an unexpected silver or bronze, great.  If you are Canada, in hockey, Gold is the min standard.  I get the sportsmanship idea, but it was an emotional response we expect from a winner.  Give Jocelyne a break!
3357 2018-02-22 21:48:07 please make a gold event.
3358 2018-02-22 21:48:06 Ratings gold to me would be Bang Bang Bimbo @DLoesch and the @NRA being arrested for trying to buy dildos in Alabama.
3359 2018-02-22 21:48:05 See how happy players get when you’re the top team! You get a gold medal! If Dems had their way everyone would get a gold medal even ones that are lazy or terrible at the sport! Spread that wealth?! lol USA the top team! Congrats!
3360 2018-02-22 21:48:04 Is there anything more passive-aggressive than lol?

3364 2018-02-22 21:47:57 I'm against her and the NRA. Blue wave all the way, however she actually said that crying white mother's are ratings gold to MSM.
3365 2018-02-22 21:47:56  ну да, можно ещё разок
3366 2018-02-22 21:47:56 The whole guns thing is a real alien concept to us across the pond, we really can’t get our heads around it.  Trump is worth his weight in gold from an entertainment point of view though, that’s for sure...!

3368 2018-02-22 21:47:51 It was super great to watch the us women's hockey team to win the gold but very sad on how empty the stands were this is the Olympics never seen this before
3369 2018-02-22 21:47:46 gold star is better than skyline
3370 2018-02-22 21:47:41 Canada STAY winning the Gold. Finally get silver and you a sore loser. Wow.

3387 2018-02-22 21:47:02 I was glad to wake up to the news about #usawomenshockey getting gold. But it's hard to feel any kind of pride in America right now while many politicians dont seem to care about the victims of #Parkland

3413 2018-02-22 21:46:07 There was one bloke on here who was calling the women who were raped 'gold diggers' because he showed them cash and they agreed to have a drink with him. Like seriously, wtf?
3414 2018-02-22 21:46:05 Agreed that there is still “O” gold there. But more time on ice, more involved/bigger roll can free some of that gold. Be a legit threat on PK to go the other way.

3455 2018-02-22 21:44:24 My favorite Olympic moment so far is when Jim took the gold in the Men’s Downhill.  Next favorite would be his Speedskating gold. Can’t wait to watch him in the women’s singles figure skating tonight.

3463 2018-02-22 21:44:03 So is it true that the Hoffman's didn't get resigned on a new contract ,because there is a new gold rush crew coming in?
3464 2018-02-22 21:44:03 It's only an Oscar. She's gotten many other awards.. In fact the oscar trophy isn't even made out of real gold. However I bet she get's paid what she deserves for her films. Plus she doesn't play any negative roles.. Monique got an oscar for being the worse parent of all time.

3477 2018-02-22 21:43:28 I 100% understand Jocelyne Larocque was disappointed at the loss of the gold medal game but come on, you got the silver medal. You beat out every team but one. You could have at least kept the medal on until the end of the ceremony.
3478 2018-02-22 21:43:27 The remoaner comments are comedy gold lol
3479 2018-02-22 21:43:25 wow today was horrible I need to make 45 gold this Saturday morning to afternoon! you guys can do so much better!
3480 2018-02-22 21:43:25 Yeah, it’s sort of like arguing over which type of gold is more valuable; they’re all valuable, just some more than others.
3481 2018-02-22 21:43:23 lots of gold class deals on presently for the who like to fly business class like me to the movies :)
3482 2018-02-22 21:43:22 ok @whilehazey showed me a fantastic video in the making and “wasn’t sure if he liked it” SO can we all virtually slap some sense back into this dumbo and remind him that everything he makes is gold ?? thank you rt to save a life
3483 2018-02-22 21:43:17 Sure, I took a little gold, but the owner had been dead for 300 years. It's not like he was going to do anything with it. #bot
3484 2018-02-22 21:43:16 If you feel that a silver medal is not good enough you should be told to leave the team and let someone else receive the medal. Gold is always nice but don’t embarrass Canada as a nation doing something stupid!!

3499 2018-02-22 21:42:57 I mean we’re both pretty fond of the mixed metal look in general. I think the rose gold is a nice compromise though bc it’s not trying to match the other gold or silver I wear on a daily basis.
3500 2018-02-22 21:42:56 @HayesTSN it is GOLD! But you got to use Leading Scorer of each team! #JebronLames would love the extra attention!

3523 2018-02-22 21:41:56 Yes the USA roster was underwhelming but so many people bitched about the shootout after they lost. Now they win a gold with it and it’s all good.

BUT

Completely pathetic that a Gold Medal game is decided in a shootout.

1) Were it ADHERED to it would still be the Gold Standard of individual liberty - in a formal written down and institutionalized form.
2) The Parkland 4 that are all over media demanding 'action' and disarmament are all drama students - and while they may not be the ones
3535 2018-02-22 21:41:26 I get the whole "Why shootout for a gold?" complaint. But before that, WHY IS THERE 4 ON 4 OT IN A GOLD MEDAL GAME? 4 on 4 OT is a novel idea by the NHL to keep things interesting and end less regular season games in ties. It is NOT A MODEL FOR REAL OVERTIME.

3547 2018-02-22 21:40:54 I get why Jocelyne Larocque took off the silver after it was awarded. She & @HC_Women worked for 4 years to repeat gold in Sochi, all dedicated their livesto their craft. It had to have been a terrible disappointment to get silver in a *shootout*. Timing of IIHF official was poor

3550 2018-02-22 21:40:50 I appreciate her passion, actually.  If you are a small country and get an unexpected silver or bronze, great.  If you are Canada, in hockey, Gold is the min standard.  I get the sportsmanship idea, but it was an emotional response we expect from a winner.  Give Jocelyn a break!

3591 2018-02-22 21:39:18 Bred toes are 100% better then gold toes by a long run
3592 2018-02-22 21:39:17 My performance needs to be better than flawless for a chance at the gold.

3597 2018-02-22 21:39:04 Yea
3598 2018-02-22 21:39:03 Canada may have lost in women's hockey and I'm still proud of them. However I'm annoyed that olympics allow shoot outs for important gold medal games. Win or lose shoot outs should never be a deciding factor. Stick to OTs  #PyeongChang2018 #TeamCanada #WinterOlympics
3599 2018-02-22 21:39:02 @DallasStars Being the only American team to not say a single word about the women's gold medal? NOT A GOOD LOOK.

Bloom puns
“Dichotomy”
3601 2018-02-22 21:38:55 I understand the passion for wanting to win the gold medal but they didn't win but that doesn't mean to act like a petulant child on live TV in front of the world

3605 2018-02-22 21:38:32 I just cannot resist the urge to jump on the heads of small animals in hopes of gold coins exploding from their lifeless corpses.

3607 2018-02-22 21:38:24 I like Rose gold to tbh 
3608 2018-02-22 21:38:22 While he who has the gold makes the rules (#NRA, #Congress) it is the people who have the power to change the game. To all the young people out there you do have the power to change the game! Keep up the amazing work! #NeverAgain
3609 2018-02-22 21:38:19 Good work! Quality recovery.
Looked like a very useful 2 days @Blue_Sticks, well done. Looking forward to seeing you perform at Gold Coast!

3613 2018-02-22 21:38:12 You should make comment comeback video for this or something, cause this is gold!

3618 2018-02-22 21:37:58 Also every large crown I've got so far has been that silverish one, so if large gold crowns actually exist you'd have to be stupid lucky to get one

3625 2018-02-22 21:37:46 Due to the massive drawdown of the crypto market we decided to accelerate the introduction of our youngest brainchild - the PECUNIO GOLD COIN. Being fully backed with gold, it will offer great stability and a safe haven in uncertain times.

3638 2018-02-22 21:37:15 @HC_Women what an amazing game. In my eyes you are champions. You earned the right to be in the gold medal game by defeating all your opponents. Then you played 80 minutes to a draw. I think Bobsleigh had it right with TWO gold medals.
3639 2018-02-22 21:37:15 Stop comparing Bitcoin to Gold, Show me the fucking Bitcoin on the periodic table MOTHERFUCKERS
3640 2018-02-22 21:37:11 You forgot to ask the family of America’s biggest juvenile, @realDonaldTrump, how they feel about his disrespect of politicians, women, the disabled, Gold Star families, non-whites, the Central Park 5, Oprah, Journalists, and all those not named in his tweet. Do get back to us.
3641 2018-02-22 21:37:10 Starting to wonder if 20 is the magic number. Took Dale Earnhardt 20 years to win the #Daytona500 and 20 years later the 3 car went back to win the 500. The US Women’s Hockey team made history by winning their 1st gold medal 20 years after US men’s hockey beat Soviet Union

All the Best to all of you, from a Fan!!!
3649 2018-02-22 21:36:56 everything that shine ain’t always gold
3650 2018-02-22 21:36:52 電源は700Wも必要ないかもですが、将来的に変更する際を考えると700Wもありですし、今使うにしても500WのGOLDランクはオススメしておきます。グリスは水冷であれば最上位の物を入れたほうがとても効率が良く冷えますし、劣化しにくいのでオススメです
3651 2018-02-22 21:36:52 Oh for sure. And they've won 7 of the past 8 world Championships and are actually ranked number 1 in the world. Just in Canada if you don't get gold in hockey it's always a bummer lol.
3652 2018-02-22 21:36:51 Thanks to CBC TV I was able to see the end of Gold medal match in woman's Hockey, all be it in French.  Still great to watch, but not like a mach ending in shoot out.  Play full extra periods for the gold.
3653 2018-02-22 21:36:51 I think a white/black/gold would work with this concept too
3654 2018-02-22 21:36:50 And it's amazing that they received very little financial support from our Olympic Committee. I believe they get  $37000 for their Gold, but local people sponsored them before the win. We need to pay the Olympic committee staff less and give money to the Athletes.

3688 2018-02-22 21:35:30 Switzerland was pointless to invade and was used as a tool to store stolen gold & goods. It wasn’t left un-invaded because they had guns 
3689 2018-02-22 21:35:22 Maybe the best strategy at this point is to tear away everything except Wonder Woman and Shazam (maybe Aquaman and Flash can stay too) and start with something completely fresh. Blue Beetle and Booster Gold buddy comedy movie anyone?

3705 2018-02-22 21:34:32 Blanche on the stair lift with Ken was comedy gold!
3706 2018-02-22 21:34:29 Not tonight.  Friday night/Saturday morning.  I think the bronze medal game is that time tonight.  They save the gold for the following day.
3707 2018-02-22 21:34:28 Did you know?...USA Gold Medal winning Women's Hockey goalie Maddie Rooney played H.S. Varsity softball for @And_Softball just a few short years ago.
3708 2018-02-22 21:34:28 He's a sociopath & I'm not kidding. He had to be told how to look like he cares. It's why he can attack gold star families in mourning.
3709 2018-02-22 21:34:27 For a Wednesday late night/early Thursday morning, I’d say pretty good. Depending on who plays, I don’t see men’s beating that by much for this weekends gold medal game.

3712 2018-02-22 21:34:16 You know what else is ratings gold?
Impeachment hearings.
3713 2018-02-22 21:34:10 Response from the right after shooting: students were "coached," they're "pawns," they're "crisis actors," they're "opportunists," they're "ratings gold." Pretty vile - it's almost like the right doesn't care about the shootings at all. @DLoesch @NRA

With up to 100mm of rain predicted for the Gold Coast today we're being reminded not to drive through flooded roads. 

@BOM_Qld says we'll see the most of the rain today and it will be predominantly drizzle throughout the day, with heavy bursts of rainfall intermittently
3733 2018-02-22 21:33:12 What dumbass thought it would be a good idea to end a gold medal championship game in shootouts?
3734 2018-02-22 21:33:08 The women’s hockey gold medal game is re-airing rn.
3735 2018-02-22 21:33:08 Sorry Megan and Skyline, I'm heading to Gold Star after work.
3736 2018-02-22 21:33:06 This is the first tweet you’ve sent on our Olympic athletes - never wished them luck, never acknowledged any other Gold medals, nothing! A leper pox on you, traitor!
3737 2018-02-22 21:33:03 @UnturnedSpanish Hola Una Pregunta Nose Si Sabes De Esto Pero Necesito Ayuda:c Acabo De Comprar Unturned Gold Permanent y Nose Como O Donde Esta:c Nose Como Instalarlo Y No Me Aparece En La Biblioteca

3740 2018-02-22 21:32:56 CONGRATS TO @KPan19 FOR WINNING THE GOLD!! It's insane that I can say I watched you from the varsity lacrosse bench in high school and now on TV at the Olympics! 
3741 2018-02-22 21:32:56 anyone wanna relive nervousness and being stressed as hell.. flip to NBCSN as the Gold medal game is just in the 1st period
3742 2018-02-22 21:32:55 Im not going to have a 3 finger ring in 18kt gold LOL so yes costume jewelry serves a purpose and its fun
3743 2018-02-22 21:32:54 Instead of "thank you for all your hard work on this party you threw" I get "you really made others feel isolated for not including them."

Apparently the department-wide email I sent that NONE of the responded to wasn't the personalized gold-trimmed invitations they needed.
3744 2018-02-22 21:32:49 Gold !
3745 2018-02-22 21:32:47 That's pretty neat! Trying to dodge his fireball was a pain so I can't even imagine a gold crown's.
3746 2018-02-22 21:32:43 Based on one or two I don't even have time to answer you right now.
3747 2018-02-22 21:32:43 Poor winners aren’t very becoming! Canada  has won every gold metal since the Americans won their last one 20 years ago. Act like you’ve won before #BeAClassyWinner
3748 2018-02-22 21:32:42 You mean this Dana Loesch at @CPAC: "Many in legacy media love mass shootings," says NRA spox, saying "crying white mothers are ratings gold"

3751 2018-02-22 21:32:35 I would  be okay with abolishing the shootout for the Gold medal game.

3757 2018-02-22 21:32:16 Absolute gold  
3758 2018-02-22 21:32:09 @DLoesch The NRA is the group that Loves Mass Shootings, it's pure gold for gun sales! You had to Hijack a Teenage Girls  We cry BS! What, you can't come up with an original thought? Easy to strut on the stage and spew the Company line but so much harder to do the right thing!
3759 2018-02-22 21:32:08 I dont have a huge striking statement necklace that covers my whole declate in gold or silver but we can do it with feathers.. beads and crystals LOL
3760 2018-02-22 21:32:06 Really upset about the fact that 6 of the storage bags from my @LansinohUSA pack have come with holes in them and are spilling my liquid gold all over the place. .
3761 2018-02-22 21:32:02 Omg yes. And I was so excited to see their skate off that night I Injured myself.  the judges were so annoyed they didn’t give either of them gold.
3762 2018-02-22 21:32:00 When a segment of society falls into evil actions, a reaction will occur if politicians sit down. Wells Fargo & Pinkerton found ways in the Wild West to protect gold. Our children are gold now.
3763 2018-02-22 21:31:55 Muss jetzt eigentlich @marcgisin 2022 eine Olympische Gold-Medaille holen nach Dominique 2014 und Michelle 2018? ;)
Herzliche Gratulation ans ganze Ski-Team für diesen tollen Weckdienst mit 3 Medaillen! #güetemorgu #srfpyeongchang #hoppschwiiz
3764 2018-02-22 21:31:50 It takes a lot of courage to pull that move in a shoot out with the gold medal on the line
3765 2018-02-22 21:31:50 Women complete Ironman competitions, which I consider the gold standard for bad-ass athleticism. Thus, they can do everything men do in the Olympics.
3766 2018-02-22 21:31:47 It's still there! I can't believe he didn't delete it. Comedy gold. :P

3775 2018-02-22 21:31:30 1980 was an incomparable miracle.  The US women were a faster and more skilled team.  This should have been their 2nd straight gold.  An awesome accomplishment for USA women's team, but shouldn't be compared to 1980.

3778 2018-02-22 21:31:29 I try not to get political in my tweets, but I swear to Pete that the overall insanity we have going on right now, coupled with the lack of empathy, reason, and ability see issues as a whole and ZERO compromise ideals is the gold for which comedians can make their careers on.

3780 2018-02-22 21:31:26 @TeamShuster just watched the replay and the boys continue the magic. 4 in a row with 2 over Canada means Friday late night will be beer curls while watching a shot at gold.

3783 2018-02-22 21:31:21 Really? AP: "Many in legacy media love mass shootings, you guys love it," said NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch at CPAC. "Now I'm not saying that you love the tragedy, but I am saying that you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold."

3789 2018-02-22 21:31:12 Dana Loesch, the ever-compassionate and always-classy NRA spokeswoman, said today that many members of the news media "love mass shootings" and that "crying white mothers are ratings gold.” Do you think she is:
#NeverAgain
3790 2018-02-22 21:31:06 Boy i really want gold on my teeth for the summer lol
3791 2018-02-22 21:31:04 This is gold... @dadobray and @_MikeMal_ will be straight scrapping over material spottage and demo duty. Roll cameras... #CutIt

3794 2018-02-22 21:30:58 Yes first time winning gold
3795 2018-02-22 21:30:51 After multiple beers EH! The Olympic gold medal game should be OT until someone wins, the shootout is dumb IMO.
3796 2018-02-22 21:30:48 Stenmark had two pairs of skies at Lake Placid 1980 when he won two gold medals .
One pair for inspection and one pair for race 

3797 2018-02-22 21:30:47 gold... jewels... mine. all mine
3798 2018-02-22 21:30:42 I'm pretty sure Auburn painted that silver medal on the wall of their athletic facilities.  Not everyone expects gold.
3799 2018-02-22 21:30:37 Wrestlers on Insta is a gold mine.
3800 2018-02-22 21:30:37 This woman from NRA, won’t say her name, is everything that’s bad about our country. A hundred MS-13 gangs couldn’t do damage this entitled woman has brought and will bring upon this land and its ppl. A crying” white” mother is ratings Gold” hope she is not next. She be Platinum
3801 2018-02-22 21:30:35 Lol when God want to disgrace u and punish you at the same time thats what just happen to BAMBAM. 5
3802 2018-02-22 21:30:33 Holy shit balls!  Dana Loesch talking about "crying white mothers" being "ratings gold" was some of the most craven, disgusting, bullshit I have heard in awhile...which, in 2 years filled with utter craven, disgusting bullshit, is saying something.
3803 2018-02-22 21:30:29 Lmaoo 
3804 2018-02-22 21:30:29 Keep them they naturally color no fancy gold platinum
3805 2018-02-22 21:30:27 Here's my hill to die on.  If an Olympic event is true competition between a clock, or other competitors (hockey, curling, snowboard cross, speed skating) then it's good.  If it's gold is determined by judges it's crap.  Or art at best.
3806 2018-02-22 21:30:26 Stockie purposely screwing up the stop to prevent Whitty from getting a drag off. Comedy gold.
3807 2018-02-22 21:30:22 So basically after 226 years of being the worlds' Gold Standard of individual rights & liberty, the #BillOfRights  is about to be nullified by a bunch of GLEE club #highschoolmusical kids?!

3809 2018-02-22 21:30:16 Ha she's trying to play the race card and change the focus..nice try but no. Ratings gold would be watching you get shot at that podium on live tv. THEN stand there bleeding out and defend the rights of the SHOOTER I would tune in for that. #NeverAgain #GunReformNow #fucktheNRA
3810 2018-02-22 21:30:16 your nhs colleagues must stop saying fusion is gold standard and get behind vbt #nonfusionscoliosis #stgeorges
3811 2018-02-22 21:30:15 As someone who has been a diehard FS fan most of my life I just think Yuuri Katsuki is beautiful and I often see IRL skating outfits and think that I’d love fan art of him wearing it. I also really enjoy him draped in gold medals so 
3812 2018-02-22 21:30:10 And on that note: Do you support Trump disrespecting and/or being belligerent towards: Gold Star parents, veterans, the disabled, war heroes, women, Muslims, Mexicans, "s**thole countries" = black ppl, Native Americans, peaceful protesters, the law? THAT'S disturbing.
3813 2018-02-22 21:30:09 Update your bio #gold

3817 2018-02-22 21:30:05 The States beating Canada 1 out of 5 games in Olympic Gold metal games is like the @Eagles beating the @Patriots in the SB and thinking they are a Dynasty lol, Win 3 more in a row then you can come trash talk team Canada
3818 2018-02-22 21:30:04 @usahockey Hello et bonjour from Montreal. Congratulations on your gold medal victory. Have a lovely celebration and safe journey home.

3821 2018-02-22 21:29:57 Mike, I agree. A SO is a poor way to decide a gold medal. Congtats to  Ladies team for a hard fought match and win. It could have gone either way through the entire game.
3822 2018-02-22 21:29:54 i bought em all b/c i'm gold broke ... just barely had enough to take blade to 4/55

3828 2018-02-22 21:29:39 @DLoesch I’m sorry you feel crying white mothers are ratings gold. Please don’t minimize their pain. Losing a child is tragic & their stories need to be heard. I’m sorry you can’t be empathetic. You’re more enraged at the media than driving real change. #neveragain
3829 2018-02-22 21:29:39 Dwars door Vlaanderen wss ook en Amstel Gold ook
3830 2018-02-22 21:29:35 how can people be upset for coming second in the Olympics you beat other country's to get that spot ffs I would be so happy to even get 3rd jfc people need to stop thinking gold is everything
3831 2018-02-22 21:29:32 I've been a @Hertz Gold Plus member for a number of years, and I'm incredibly disappointed to learn of their partnership with the NRA. I will immediately begin using a different rental car company until Hertz ends this partnership.
3832 2018-02-22 21:29:29 10 seconds on the internet and I see a 40 round clip emptying in under a minute. Perhaps the NRA should get the AR-15 into an olympic event. Gold for whose first to slaughter a herd of deer.

3838 2018-02-22 21:29:08 Dana Loesch from the NRA has a lot of nerve stating that legacy@media lives mass shootings because a white crying mother is ratings gold. That statement is vile and disgusting

3845 2018-02-22 21:28:49 Wow! Just Wow!  Proud to be Canadian  and the effort all of our athletes.  
Let’s see, Canada is currently 3rd in the medal count and the US of A is ummmm...... oh yah 4th with only 8 gold.  Great rivalry either way!
3846 2018-02-22 21:28:48 A team earns a Gold or Bronze;  Silver is just given to a loser.  Awards given right after a game finish is a bad idea.  Emotions are high right in this tight a game and need time!
3847 2018-02-22 21:28:47 What does it say about Canada that two iconic Olympic moments were @jonmonty drinking beer from a pitcher on the streets of Whistler in 2010 and @ScottMoir having a beer and beaking the refs at Gold Medal game in 2018? #Canadaisthebest

4029 2018-02-22 21:21:22 We'll see more of God's glory, miracles, we must put the world behind us, the lusts of the flesh, and the idols, the adulterous hearts after gold, we must press into the kingdom of heaven, for it shall come.
4030 2018-02-22 21:21:21 Anyone else heading over to @NevillGolf for the @ThePGA Social Gold Networking event? Looking forward to talking shop & find ways to move my business forward
4031 2018-02-22 21:21:19 @RocketLeague You guys need an overall skill cap on the tournament system. fighting against a person with a champion banner in a gold tournament isn't fun. I like the new update though, lots of possibilities!
4032 2018-02-22 21:21:13 My favourite trailer, companion and series. Everything about series 4, from Murray Gold's amazing score, decent stories and much better dynamic of Doctor/Companion 
4033 2018-02-22 21:21:09 How about keeping them at 10 gold and make them cost 5-8 Soulstone Crystals and 5 Sacred Crystals? I had 2k SS crystals and i dont have any left since i had to buy elements for Aransu. Its freaking pathetic we have to think for the 'dev' team instead and still not be heard

4042 2018-02-22 21:20:47 So the schedule was made by a Canadian company and released on the day of the gold medal between Canada and US? Makes a whole lot more sense now 
4043 2018-02-22 21:20:46 And your picks for Gold, Silver, and Bronze?
4044 2018-02-22 21:20:45 Last 07:55 mins for hockey game

4046 2018-02-22 21:20:38 Awwwww. Thanks. We knew you had a heart of gold in there somewhere Tony
4047 2018-02-22 21:20:37 According to you-she is a loser bc she didn’t win the gold. Bet you those that won the bronze would have been happy to receive the silver.
4048 2018-02-22 21:20:35 USA women won ice hockey gold
Uh oh i can swear it was canada they beat
4049 2018-02-22 21:20:34 @espnhomer Love your enthusiasm for the Women's Hockey team.
What a beautifully intense game, eh? Hate the shooting for a Gold though.
4050 2018-02-22 21:20:34 Absolutely love that two separate stories from #PyeongChang2018 involve Canadians drinking beer. Scott Moir & Shawn Germain, I salute you. #ImnotdrunkImjustCanadian. Oh and congrats on the gold medal, Scott.
4051 2018-02-22 21:20:33 Managed not to spend any money at all today I need a gold star for that responsible behaviour

4054 2018-02-22 21:20:26 Honestly, I feel bad for them. The mental gymnastics are gold medal level
4055 2018-02-22 21:20:24 I've watched @JocelyneUSA17 's gold-medal winning shootout move about 100 times this morning. The coaches on our Squirt team have practice tonight, and we've talked about showing the kids the video and having them try the move. Why not? I wanna keep celebrating this women's team!
4056 2018-02-22 21:20:17 @Guard_Jere how will you coordinate gold with every day outfits?
4057 2018-02-22 21:20:15 Hi just a daily reminder of how beautiful you are inside out  you've got a heart of gold and such an affective soul  we honestly don't deserve you tho 
Love u 
4058 2018-02-22 21:20:07 Yes, walking chillul hashems (chilluls hashem?) are so lovely
4059 2018-02-22 21:20:04 Damn, just watched the US Women's Olympic Hockey Team get their GOLD MEDALS!! *sniff* *sigh* #USAUSAUSA!!
4060 2018-02-22 21:20:02 So I knew @AtlantaFX was considered a gem, but nah this show is pure gold!!! From the plot to the soundtrack! From the quotes to banger lines that make you think. I can’t get enough!! So mad I slept on it this long can’t wait till season 2 next week!
4061 2018-02-22 21:20:02 やっと終わりだぁ
4062 2018-02-22 21:20:02 One of my favourites, that entire scenes is gold

4064 2018-02-22 21:20:01 Ahaha! That is hilarious, Liza! Now I want to see the outtakes from all the HGs. That must be a gold mine.

4067 2018-02-22 21:19:41 How did you find out it was an Uber?....comedy gold
4068 2018-02-22 21:19:38 Of the 40 hockey players that dressed for the women’s Olympic gold-medal game, 27 skated in at least one match vs. the #Badgers in Madison. Helps explain all the sellout crowds at LaBahn. Also helps validate strength of schedules and playoff resumes each season.
4069 2018-02-22 21:19:35 And now you have to say, "Phil, brother of gold medalist Amanda Kessel"
4070 2018-02-22 21:19:27 Wow, you are one tough cookie! Way to hang in there, keep your composure, and lead the team to gold! My new favorite player @Bdecker14
4071 2018-02-22 21:19:19 Honestly, the only good thing about the Olympics for USA so far is Shaun White's gold medal run.
4072 2018-02-22 21:19:18 Lmaoo unless u have a gold small car i think ur good, this mom deadass took a pic and everyone was shitting on her
4073 2018-02-22 21:19:16 I agree with the statement, but for me I just prefer Xbox on games ui and service level. The service itself does go up and down. I wish we had the ps plus level of games on games with gold. I’m not unhappy with my current log on Xbox, because I have what appeals to me.
4074 2018-02-22 21:19:05 @FCB_Gold
4075 2018-02-22 21:19:04 love an emotional moment when someone wins gold unexpectedly and all those years of training suddenly pay off -- gives me goosebumps!
4076 2018-02-22 21:19:00 There’s people I’ve known my whole life I wouldn’t marry 
4077 2018-02-22 21:18:58 If I don’t get a gold I’m removing my silver medal in protest. No one can be better than me. #EntitledChildren
4078 2018-02-22 21:18:58 You hide in the ugliest ruin. On the floor are lavender coffins. You see something staring at you.  Wait, it's a whale, it wears opulent jewelry of gold and gemstones.

4083 2018-02-22 21:18:46 I LOVE FRIENDSHIP also can we add in an injury arc where ong ends up injuring himself during the skate when he falls wrongly and entrusts mh to nail the jump in the end to win the gold on his behalf and ong sits there on the sidelines cheering him on v_v ok i made my self sad now
4084 2018-02-22 21:18:44 I got to cover US Women winning the hockey gold in Nagano in 1998, the first year women competed in Olympic hockey. It was a tremendous experience. Didn’t think it would take ‘em 20 years to win another, but very glad they did.
4085 2018-02-22 21:18:42 El refrán decía "La tercera es la vencida". El atleta tuvo dos fallidos y la tercera lo logró, remontó, superó y ganó. Felicidades al atleta #USA David Wise medalla de Oro #Gold en la rama #FreestyleSkiing #Halfpipe #PyeongChang2018

USA's first Olympic title since the sport's debut in 1998.
4097 2018-02-22 21:18:23 Wanted to say this this morning but wasn't sure how: 

If you're American, you can't hate shootouts after the men's team lost to the Czechs in one on Wednesday morning, but then love them after beating Canada  for women's hockey gold this morning.

4100 2018-02-22 21:18:17 Maybe they should award everyone silver a soon as they make it to the gold medal round so it feels like you're willing it. Then the winner trades their silver for gold!
4101 2018-02-22 21:18:14 @TeamShuster Great game this morning boyz!! Now let's bring home the GOLD!

Two terrific teams played, one of them had to lose, even thou the shootout is a horrible way to decide a game like this. Or shall we bring up the non-call on the cheap head shot?

4161 2018-02-22 21:16:04 Pay no attention to that girl who came into your life just to dry your bank account, she a gold digger.

4162 2018-02-22 21:16:02 The games great,I restarted once, and how do I get the lemons to be gold?
4163 2018-02-22 21:15:52 My biggest positive surprise at the #2018Olympics has been the performance of the @usacurl men's team. I didn't expect much; they started poorly; but now they are going to play for the gold.
4164 2018-02-22 21:15:48 She will wear it with pride down the road.  In a gold medal game you don't win silver, you lose gold.

4167 2018-02-22 21:15:47 Olivia Breen won the Gold
Medal in the T38 Long Jump at the 2017 World Para-athletics Championships in
London.
4168 2018-02-22 21:15:43 The only thing worse about shootouts in gold medal games is that the US is really good at shootouts in gold medal games.
4169 2018-02-22 21:15:43 Finalmente tenho a rose gold da HudaSombras superrr pigmentadas !
4170 2018-02-22 21:15:41 It’s garbage. There is no reason to speed up a gold medal game. They only happen every 4 years we can watch hockey for 5 hours if needed.
4171 2018-02-22 21:15:39 Seems to be a bit racist to go with her other obvious sociopathy. "Crying white mothers are ratings gold.”
4172 2018-02-22 21:15:37 Stream is a bit up in the air this evening. Since I didn't get much sleep due to watching the US Women's hockey team win gold last night, I am super tired right now. Might take a nap when I get off work then perhaps go live with some Darksiders or something else chill. Stay tuned
4173 2018-02-22 21:15:36 That’s actually a low five... lol.  Congrats guys.  Bring home that GOLD!

4177 2018-02-22 21:15:32 Sure sure. Now what are your thoughts on the sitting president of skate Canada Ms. Leanna Caron adjudicating at the ICs dance olympics with A Canadian couple battling for the gold? Do tell.
4178 2018-02-22 21:15:30 So the women’s hockey team wins a Gold medal and you wanna talk about what the men did 37 years ago? Typical.
4179 2018-02-22 21:15:28 >Nation is almost always covered in snow 
>Can't win gold at the winter Olympics
4180 2018-02-22 21:15:28 I seriously laughed out loud.... This is the best suntan show ever. Radio gold!
4181 2018-02-22 21:15:24 @ShannonSzabados You were absolutely fantastic last night and were only reason Canada made it to a shootout.  Hold your head high.  You are and will always be a gold medalist to me and all Canadians.  So proud of you.
4182 2018-02-22 21:15:18 I shall never forget that she was a fabricated gold medalist, who was manufactured by her powerful support lobby.

4197 2018-02-22 21:14:50 @armstrongda J sent him this so I would pop this into the content plan... fucking gold
4198 2018-02-22 21:14:48 She still could've waited until off the ice to take off the medal. Everyone wants gold, works very hard for it, but there's no shame in 2nd & 3rd. She likely wasn't thinking, that's part of the problem. Her anger and bitterness got the better of her while everyone was watching.
4199 2018-02-22 21:14:48 I smile because I've been through the fire and came out as Gold 
4200 2018-02-22 21:14:43 Our Canadian permanent resident cards came in the mail today!

4311 2018-02-22 21:10:59 @ClayTravis now that the #USA is playing for curling gold, do you think you will need to work harder/longer to make the #2022 team??
4312 2018-02-22 21:10:57 Jim won gold in doubles skeleton
4313 2018-02-22 21:10:57 kiermaier missed a huge chunk of time and pillar still couldn't win the gold glove..if anything grichuk should be in centre and pillar to the Dunedin blue jays.
4314 2018-02-22 21:10:57 imho, incorporating actual yesterday footage into the Afton, MN commercial hasn't received the appreciation it deserves.  Gold medal, @Comcast

4316 2018-02-22 21:10:56 Wait, what game's starting now? vsUS Men's Gold medal game delayed?
4317 2018-02-22 21:10:44 Gold! @stereobailey
4318 2018-02-22 21:10:44 Not sure if I can watch another 45 mins. Switched to soccer gold - Arsenal from 2000-01 to cheer me up. Shocking. 
4319 2018-02-22 21:10:43 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews 
Sir, I want an investigation into the Women’s gold medal game last night.  I suspect Russian Interference.  
Congrats on the win, Russians or not U.S. women won.

4345 2018-02-22 21:10:02 My favorite part of the women's hockey gold medal game was when the correct team won the game and got the gold medals
4346 2018-02-22 21:10:00 The Gold Cup. Had he stood up and given Don Cossack a fright two years ago no one would be even asking the question

4361 2018-02-22 21:09:32 Lol love how @LadyNadiaEssex gets so excited with her clients when they strike gold!  #CelebsGoDating
4362 2018-02-22 21:09:31 This is breathtaking. Is there a precise name for the kind of gold chain/collar you're wearing?
4363 2018-02-22 21:09:26 As long as they slip on a gold watch .
4364 2018-02-22 21:09:25 Russia has overtaken China as the fifth-biggest sovereign holder of gold, allowing it to diversify its foreign currency holdings amid a deepening rift with the U.S.
4365 2018-02-22 21:09:23 As a dad of a little girl U.S. #womenshockey players are such role models! Fight for equal pay/rights then go win gold! Boom! Way to go!
4366 2018-02-22 21:09:23 *mabel voice* COMEDY GOLD!

4372 2018-02-22 21:09:07 They should be applauded for this. They know their value, they specialized in Gold Dust not Dust Mites 
4373 2018-02-22 21:09:07 WOW! Women’s big air was dope as hell. Anna Grasser has got me all confused, she broke my heart beating the US out of gold but has also stole it in the process. #Olympics2018
4374 2018-02-22 21:09:06 Poor Rippon.  No gold.   ...Not even a silver!  But when it comes to spreading discord and division,  he has no equal!
4375 2018-02-22 21:09:06 BTW - the movie is terrible except for that one scene, which IMHO is gold.
4376 2018-02-22 21:09:06 This is absolutely what needs to happen. Every seat should be filled with green and gold. The game just serves as a place where the NBA will actually see our love for our Supersonics.
4377 2018-02-22 21:09:05 It’s a team sport that should be settled by team effort until one wins...not individual skills to decide...collective effort takes the gold!! And thanks for shitting on your own Country instead of congratulating the winners...
4378 2018-02-22 21:09:02 Exactly

4384 2018-02-22 21:08:47 A nation that's covered in snow 8 months of the year can't win gold at the winter Olympics
4385 2018-02-22 21:08:47 I think the gold variant does like 196 ish damage to the head. Purple is around 187, it'll 1 shot unless they're basically maxed out on health and shield. Nice to take peak shots with it cause if you land one they're hurting
4386 2018-02-22 21:08:46 Bout to watch the USA women's hockey team. I heard they won the gold already, but I need to see for myself #OlympicHockey
4387 2018-02-22 21:08:45 If my son lectured & ridiculed these soulless Senators that are on the take f the other NRA I would a give him an F-ing gold star. Remember, Senator today, unemployed castaway tomorrow. I'll follow these young warriors into the future any day before these spineless politicians.

4391 2018-02-22 21:08:37 I'm economics focused as a matter of course, and a rocket costing as much as #SLS won't allow any room for value. It's like talking about extracting gold from sea water. And since the SLS takes such a share of NASA's budget it doesn't leave room to afford any industrialization.
4392 2018-02-22 21:08:36 GOLD IS FUN AGAIN!
4393 2018-02-22 21:08:35 The Canadian women’s ice hockey team look so happy heading into this replay of the gold medal final vs Team USA. I bet that changes later.

4400 2018-02-22 21:08:24 “Many in legacy media love mass shootings” because “crying white mothers our ratings gold” you Dana will rot in hell. What we’re loving though is that you and the NRA have revealed to the whole world that all you care about is blood money. You have no shame, and zero compassion.

4405 2018-02-22 21:08:20 There is nothing wrong with losing.. even if Canada loses in basketball like Toronto against LeBron. Or in woman's hockey against the u.s. you will.learn from it..at least Canadia. men's team has a chance at gold since NHL players aren't allowed to compete in team u.s hockey..

4415 2018-02-22 21:07:56 I understand the time difference made prime time coverage hard. But during prime time they should have been saying over and over women are playing for gold at 12am on snbc. This was a very big deal.
4416 2018-02-22 21:07:56 China won 29

4417 2018-02-22 21:07:55 See John R. Lott's recent publication which is the gold standard for statistics now.

The data you cite are flawed.

4418 2018-02-22 21:07:55 @stereobailey Gold!!
4419 2018-02-22 21:07:52 Part 1 quote #DanaLoesch @ #CPAC: “Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you and many in the legacy media … notice I said ‘crying white mothers’ because there are thousands of grieving black mothers in Chicago every weekend, and you don’t see town halls for them, do you?"
4420 2018-02-22 21:07:45 Reading tidbits from her speech, it's clear she's mounting a comeback. One thing that sets her apart from Marine Le Pen (who is facing a hard time holding on) is that Marion holds her cards very closely to her chest.
4421 2018-02-22 21:07:43 Yeah and I get that also. I can say honestly I don’t notice it as much. I was watching the Gold Medal hockey game last night and it Twitter may have been ahead but I wasn’t looking at Twitter as closely so I don’t know for sure
4422 2018-02-22 21:07:37 Sorry - I was highlighting that EQ-5D is considered by many to be the ‘gold standard’. I would prefer that people use measures that capture the objective of their intervention.

4475 2018-02-22 21:06:12 @AmandaKessel8 time to update your intro to say Olympic GOLD medalist!
4476 2018-02-22 21:06:10 nbcsn is re-airing the USA/Canada women’s gold medal game rn and I’m watching
4477 2018-02-22 21:06:09 Gold
4478 2018-02-22 21:06:06 They certainly earned the gold last night.  They fought hard and remained in the game.  Such a wonderful group of humble, yet fierce hockey players!  Thank you for representing the U.S. and for bringing home the Gold again after 20 years! #GoTeamUSA
4479 2018-02-22 21:06:06 Enough of this "we don't play for 2nd place" bullshit. It's disrespectful. There are athletes out there that would sacrifice almost anything just to be an Olympian, let alone be talented enough to win a medal. To me,  taking off the medal means they don't think USA deserves gold.

4486 2018-02-22 21:05:56 “Many in legacy media love mass shootings” because “crying white mothers our ratings gold” you Dana will rot in hell. What we are loving though is that you and the NRA have revealed to the whole world that all you care about is blood money. You have no shame, and zero compassion.
4487 2018-02-22 21:05:56 @stereobailey GOLD!
4488 2018-02-22 21:05:55 I think gold actually, lol
4489 2018-02-22 21:05:53 I’m ot a fan of big games ending by shootout but... The way Canada was playing in OT if it continued they probably would have lost anyway as the looked exhausted... blame the coach for using such a short bench, shootout was probably best chance of winning  #gold

4495 2018-02-22 21:05:42 As well she should have been. She was a poor sport and let down the nation, and, more importantly her team. It disrespected the sport, her teammates, and the US team who earned their gold

4497 2018-02-22 21:05:38 ‘Crying white mothers’ are gun-sales gold to the NRA.
They love a good massacre, and the ensuing panic to buy more guns before they get banned.
It needs to stop

4501 2018-02-22 21:05:31 A tribute shouldn't be about public attention or acknowledgement. It should be because they want to make you smile.
4502 2018-02-22 21:05:28 I love how, when declaring their fav color, kids will also specify texture, as in: "metallic purple" or "neon gold." So discerning.

4527 2018-02-22 21:04:48 but according to our calculations the gold game is just like poker never tell everyone what you are thinking  unless no one is listening then its to see what each trader is thinking or pondering; how is gold so full of hot air? thats the money supply...where did your taxes go?

4531 2018-02-22 21:04:44 Ya know, its kinda crazy all these people in the olympics getting gold medals that are 18-20. Like 1 hell yeah, ya’ll doing more than i am with life, but 2.. they cant even drink in celebration.
4532 2018-02-22 21:04:43 Why are you people mad she took off the silver medal? They espected gold. I would be pissed too.
4533 2018-02-22 21:04:42 And what two markets are the most corrupted by derivatives in order to suppress the price of the real things? Gold and silver. Real money.
4534 2018-02-22 21:04:41 @DLoesch's comment about crying white moms being ratings gold is racist & insensitive.

The response to the Parkland #ValentineDayMassacre is because these survivors are organized & vocal.

I wouldn’t count on her not going anywhere.
4535 2018-02-22 21:04:32 This might make me a bad Canadian but I’m happy that the USA women’s hockey team won the gold over us. America has been having a rough go lately they deserve some positivity. Plus our men’s team is still in the running for gold. #USAvsCAN congrats to them
4536 2018-02-22 21:04:27 Dumb Canadian hockey player took off silver medal & refused to shake hands w/ #Gold  USA hockey women. Congratulations @USAHockeyWomen
4537 2018-02-22 21:04:26 Congrats to our Olympic Women's Hockey team on a fantastic tournament and performance during the gold medal game. You all did great, and the gold will be ours in Beijing  #TeamCanada #PyeongChang2018 #Beijing2022
4538 2018-02-22 21:04:20 I’m sure you’ll get there eventually! 

(I almost felt bad asking, I know how many people must be pointing out Gold/Silver on VC )
4539 2018-02-22 21:04:19 If watching/listening to the USA women's hockey team (and the announcers call) win gold doesn't give you goosebumps, are you even alive? #OlympicHockey #Olympics
4540 2018-02-22 21:04:19 It's just gold digging. They basically want to get as much as possible, and then push even further so that EU will have to say no. In that way, it's EU's fault.

4555 2018-02-22 21:03:42 Okay, I meant the second one.. Apparently I'm a mess :p. My main point being, If you're not first, you're last. IMO. They didn't travel to the other side of the globe to lose. She has every right to be upset with silver. Probably ruins her all gold trophy case.

4601 2018-02-22 21:02:03 Canadian commentary is very one sided & influences audience.The first 5 penalties against CAN were all legit. The referees may have missed a couple of calls but the better team won the gold. Not the referees fault that CAN made a bad line change and the US capitalized.
Go Canada!

4603 2018-02-22 21:02:03 I was a joy 2 watch the Women play hockey last night. They're the 2 best teams 2 play 4 gold. Then I woke up this morning to the poor sportsmanship of Jocelyne Larocque. I understand competition, been there done that, but she is a role model. This was sad 2 see 4 an Olympian.

4609 2018-02-22 21:01:49 That’s fair. I think I gravitate to CD because it’s just FULL of raw, ambitious talent that comes out as pure hip hop gold. And MBDTF (in my opinion) is him at the height of his creative genius

4613 2018-02-22 21:01:40 The last 3 matches Shuster finally was dialed in. He was single handedly putting his team on life support. I figured that the gold would have been between GB and Canada.

4625 2018-02-22 21:01:08 Competitive currencies are a good thing. There's no reason why gold and cryptos can't both be used.
4626 2018-02-22 21:01:08 We pay cash for gold, liquor in rear.

4630 2018-02-22 21:00:58 Your wife today? 

‘Media loves mass shootings’ as ‘crying white  mothers are ratings gold’

Those crying mothers lost their children. Media takes no pleasure in covering these all too often events.

Apparently, Dana lost her soul along the way.

4631 2018-02-22 21:00:58 Just saying, if not for the U of M, @TeamUSA would not have won gold in Women's Hockey...

4639 2018-02-22 21:00:42 Not sour grapes- plain reality, it took 5 Olympics b4 U.S. Girls could seal the deal!! I just damm hate shootouts- should be like NHL in Playoffs- u play til u score but to win Gold like that, that's tainted!!
4640 2018-02-22 21:00:41 I dnt fear shit but i rock fear of gold
4641 2018-02-22 21:00:35 This is pure gold. Amazing job :D

4643 2018-02-22 21:00:32 but like why is the rose gold pandora so much more expensive than the silver jewellery!! I need a bracelet to match my watch
4644 2018-02-22 21:00:30 Don’t have any problem with this. This is one of the few situations where you don’t “win” silver, you “lose” gold.  Hockey means a lot in Canada.  She’s upset. That’s ok.

4648 2018-02-22 21:00:25 Watching the Olympics up here in northern Vermont is interesting.  Many stations are Canadian, being this close to the border, so many are also French speaking.  Watching our @usahockey team play @TeamCanada for the gold, but w Canadian announcers.... Proud of our girls!

4664 2018-02-22 20:59:57 I can't wait to see @TheYoungTurks analysis on this CPAC insanity. Please @cenkuygur and @AnaKasparian tear them apart. This whole event is a hypocrisy gold mine and seems devoid of any humanity, emotion, or sincere desire to see shootings culled in the US.
4665 2018-02-22 20:59:57 lemme rock a gold necklace with ya name on it
4666 2018-02-22 20:59:53 Poor form. I mean, sure. Losing the gold sucks but WE STILL WON SILVER. That’s INCREDIBLE on a worldwide stage. I hope she’s got a little more perspective today. It was a hard fought game on both sides!
4667 2018-02-22 20:59:51 @GigiMarvin  Congrats from Rochester, NY on you and the ladies Gold medal ! It was a hoot and holler exciting game ! Wow, they should have a national league for the ladies. You all are amazing athletes. Wish i had a girlfriend that had Olympic or sports chops to win !!!

4679 2018-02-22 20:59:26 It is, obviously, complicated, but "eugenics", as commonly understood, is a euphemism for keeping races pure. Read as no whites mixing with blacks, Christians mixing with Jews or Muslims. So, to "protect from eugenics" means that you want to mix. Makes no sense from a LePen.

4690 2018-02-22 20:59:11 Y'all know there are gold-digger men too, right?
4691 2018-02-22 20:59:10 I really don't care that Canada lost its Woman's hockey gold. I was far more engaged and impressed at the level of quality on display. Woman's hockey has come a long way in a very short time. Bravo on an outstanding performance. Who gives two shits about the loss.
4692 2018-02-22 20:59:09  that is GOLD!
4693 2018-02-22 20:59:06 CIAC needs the $ ... If the CIAC were in charge of the Olympics, Canada would've shared the gold medal in women's ice hockey.
4694 2018-02-22 20:59:05 That game had me on the edge of my seat from the opening face-off.  Not the tiniest less proud of silver than I would have been of gold.
4695 2018-02-22 20:58:58 You're clearly smarter than me so use your brain and figure out that motor patter  development is a factor here.  You can't take Johnny at gold's gym and expect him to throw hard or fight Connor Macgregor
4696 2018-02-22 20:58:56 I've never had more fun watching arsenal before in my life. This is gold
4697 2018-02-22 20:58:56 @badeboom Bitte WO kann man die 7h-Version vom Paten sehen??? #KinoPlus
4698 2018-02-22 20:58:51 Perhaps someday @DLoesch herself will be one of those ‘ratings gold’. Maybe then she’ll grow a conscience and a heart.
4699 2018-02-22 20:58:50 We should congratulate all the teams not just the ones who win gold!!!!
4700 2018-02-22 20:58:49 Why didn’t anyone tell me the men’s curling team made it to the gold medal game?
4701 2018-02-22 20:58:44 “It’s just that we were going for gold...”

Um, DUH. What do you think the other teams were there for?  #soreloser
4702 2018-02-22 20:58:43 Hi @SzegoMill. We'd love to hear more about the Szego Mill for gold in Nevada -- finely disseminated gold in very friable host rock. #NVmining
4703 2018-02-22 20:58:41 Thank you... Thank you from everything within me!  This is gold.  Pure gold.
4704 2018-02-22 20:58:30 When I visited Rome in 1982, I had access to a gold-plated toilet, free wine & pasta & Berlusconi’s call girls.
That’s because we were good Europeans then.
4705 2018-02-22 20:58:30 No apology needed. I'm almost 50 and as far back as I can remember, every gold medal presentation at the Olympics has been immediately afterwards the conclusion of the game. Same at worlds and jr's too.
4706 2018-02-22 20:58:26 So, just award the gold medal and to heck with silver and bronze?  One winner, the rest losers?
4707 2018-02-22 20:58:22 BIG NOTE, MY TEAM CANT BE STOPPED BY ANYONE BUT THEMSELVES, LET THAT MIRANATE

4718 2018-02-22 20:57:55 I am quite disappointed in myself for having been unable to stay up late enough to see an epic gold medal hockey game between USA and Canada last night. #TeamUSA  #PyeongChang2018

4720 2018-02-22 20:57:51 On this day in 1925, singer Guy Mitchell  was born in Detroit.

4725 2018-02-22 20:57:39 @Ronnie2K a good idea for 2K19, you give us the option to pick 1 badge not given to us from our archetype and we can max it to gold. Ex: my player, A 2way Post scorer, cannot earn the break starter badge. But with this idea, I’d choose that badge and max it to gold

4729 2018-02-22 20:57:36 While driving I saw a @PepsiCanada truck and all I could think is I wish I was in Vin Diesel's Fast and Furious Crew. He'd be all he lets take down this truck for diamonds and jewels and I'd be all bro, that @PepsiCanada truck has carbonated gold.
4730 2018-02-22 20:57:31 I totally agree with the gold rims, was watching old footage the other night, V12 engine 412T from 1995, all red and gold rims, magic.

4732 2018-02-22 20:57:24 Which houses that were given it had the lands and incomes to support a castle that size? Keep in mind the Lord Paramounts were the Tullys until recently. We're talking a castle the size of Casterly Rock without it's gold or bannermen.
4733 2018-02-22 20:57:20 A Gold medal should NOT be decided by a shootout. No wonder she’s pissed.

4739 2018-02-22 20:56:58 The commentator said it perfectly. She will eventually appreciate having won the silver medal. But for right now she's just upset that she lost the gold medal.

4743 2018-02-22 20:56:52 Is Adnan is good spirits?  I mean, Canada's women lost the gold in hockey last night, then this morning the men's curling team lost to the US.

4746 2018-02-22 20:56:48 Shout out to Matt Hamilton for winning curling gold. Event though he's on #TeamUSA and he beat my Canadian team, us Matt Hamilton's need to stick together.
4747 2018-02-22 20:56:46 Settle down, Milena. The Faustian bargain you folks made to secure Olympic gold by having Trump win is definitely not one we Canadians would trade places for. ;-)

4762 2018-02-22 20:56:18 You can always bank on arsenal to always make things hard for themselves, how can you be losing 2-0 to this lot. Àwọn wéré don spoil my ticket
4763 2018-02-22 20:56:17 1 Kings 7:50 and the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.
4764 2018-02-22 20:56:15 Worst thing about CS is the noob rank you get put into I can stand playing with gold novas
4765 2018-02-22 20:56:13 The same system also put Jessica Ennis at ‘over weight’ just before she won Olympic gold. Sofia is clearly not over weight.
4766 2018-02-22 20:56:12 Excellent point. Those contracts are gold... and ESPN pays a premium. It goes back to Disney. At what point does the revenue stream of ESPN not supporting itself cause Disney to sell off, or force more cut backs?
4767 2018-02-22 20:56:08 Only congratulating the gold medal winners? How abot congratulating every US Olympic athlete for devoting years of their lives to training and putting it all on the line in competition...oh, yeah, you don't like losers.
.guess you can't stand uourself, then
4768 2018-02-22 20:56:06 So we got a NR only Gold card that only sort of, hard counters Ambush units which only Scoia can use at this moment.

I've seen some bad designed cards before in others games too but this one take the cake. Gosh.

4771 2018-02-22 20:55:58 I think they might be missing something. like a sandwich from a picnic. The whole lot depends on them getting everything on their wish list. Including from the BOE who wouldn't touch them with a barge pole. Comedy gold
4772 2018-02-22 20:55:57 At 4:37: A gold medal slipped out of the hands of Canada's Olympic Women's hockey team - and many Canadians are upset it was decided by a shootout. We'll speak to an Olympic expert.
4773 2018-02-22 20:55:57 After your outrage has subsided, ask your followers how they feel about @realDonaldTrump being disrespectful & belligerent to Women, Mexicans, Muslims, a gold star family, people of color, the media(1st amendment) etc I would continue but you get the point...hopefully!

4781 2018-02-22 20:55:41 people who say they have a gold gun for a character that doesn't have a gun trigger me
4782 2018-02-22 20:55:40 I hate when gold medal winners bite the metal - so tacky
4783 2018-02-22 20:55:40 @DLoesch Will you be ratings gold as a crying white mother if any of your kids (if you have any) become shooting victims?

4785 2018-02-22 20:55:30 Do you know why he has a gold arm/hammer now?
4786 2018-02-22 20:55:27 Congratulations girls! I think your gold medal in cross county skiing  is the highlight for U.S.  Olympics. You have inspired a whole generation!
4787 2018-02-22 20:55:24 Congratulations to Heather Tibbo, Crestbridge, Gold award winner in the Woman of the year - Leadership (Financial Organisation) category at the Citywealth #PowerwomenAwards 2018

4791 2018-02-22 20:55:16 I am leaning towards rain check. My headache is back after errands/groceries in recovery of staying up until close to 4 for gold medal game.
4792 2018-02-22 20:55:14 Gold chain. Dana stood behind them. Some pecked away at last. At least, then, they'll know where she was just adjective.
4793 2018-02-22 20:55:13 @geenag20 @AztecWBB thank you GG you have a heart of GOLD! Thank you for picking Monique up we love you Always so so so much 
4794 2018-02-22 20:55:11 Hockey is team sport. A gold medal game shouldn’t be decided by a shootout where players are counted on to perform as individuals
4795 2018-02-22 20:55:11 please I need this live Gold mine ended more than 2 months I'm crazy to play online games but I can not because my parents are not able to buy a live gold for me I need
4796 2018-02-22 20:55:03 Conspiracy theory is essentially an ad hominem. All governments eschew transparency and prefer to operate in secrecy more often than not. It's not conspiracy to conspire it's standard operating procedure.
4797 2018-02-22 20:55:00 How does the price of gold compare with a Gin & Tonic in Dublin city centre?
4798 2018-02-22 20:54:58 Good for her!! Gold is their standard! If you ain’t 1st you’re last!!
4799 2018-02-22 20:54:53 Sportsman is just that and neither one of these people has any. I don't care who it is they should be lucky they got a medal. you play for gold but be happy you got silver or bronze because they are plenty of teams that didn't get a chance to.
4800 2018-02-22 20:54:53 The Loyal Order of Nerds made it out of their first dungeon; they have excitedly spent their gold at a tavern on imaginary root beer. #boysareadorable
4801 2018-02-22 20:54:53 Watching the replay of the women's gold medal game. So proud of you guys. You all played amazing considering they had a 2 man advantage the whole game @natspooner5 @pou29 @ShannonSzabados @MeghanAgosta #refsucks #canadastillnumber1
4802 2018-02-22 20:54:50 Hahahahahaha!  This gif gold!!! Search?!
4803 2018-02-22 20:54:46 No problem. I think she mudding the waters here on purpose.
4804 2018-02-22 20:54:43 I hear that Trudeau wants to do away with medals because "silver" contains "il" which is the French word for "he" and "bronze" contains the man's name "Ron"... Next Olympics —>> everyone wins gold!#ShamefulLosers @OwenBenjamin
4805 2018-02-22 20:54:40 omg my ex (???) is a mix of white prep & white redneck and he was wearing a thin gold chain today ... y’all when i say i wheezed .
4806 2018-02-22 20:54:40 You got 1 of 2 Dave Calloway was a coach. Blackwell was not. Although he did play in the NBA and won a gold medal  playing for the USA World University team.

4808 2018-02-22 20:54:38 I was just SANGIN silver & gold x Kirk Franklin in my office like I'm at home in my bedroom lmao
4809 2018-02-22 20:54:38 It's ratings gold to the NRA, who can claim "Liberals are attacking us!" the moment a victim's family mentions guns.
4810 2018-02-22 20:54:38 Men: “I gotta have my money right cuz that’s what the women care about”
Also men: “Bitches is gold digging hoes”
4811 2018-02-22 20:54:37 @riger1984 heard you say you love beating Canada at “our” game. It was nice of our ladies to lend USA the gold. But your comment about Canadians and hockey? Kinda hypocritical, given the fact the US tends to be regarded as snobs at each and every other sport?
4812 2018-02-22 20:54:31 Room upgrade for a gold tier member on my next visit and you can have my vote in all 6 categories x
4813 2018-02-22 20:54:31 because that's what ppl know him as. look at him boasting about his tour dates etc.. i'm just saying ppl freak out and think his words are gold and divinely inspired by the heavens. no, he's just a rapper.

4818 2018-02-22 20:54:19 I can confirm that all of Hungary is in a stunned state of wonder over this Gold win because we're definitely not a wintersport country. Was listening to radio interview with Sandor & the team & the only thing they could say on repeat was "We can't believe this is real"
4819 2018-02-22 20:54:16 Harvard doesn't always mean gold standard research. I think you are too biased.
4820 2018-02-22 20:54:16 Fellas if your girl didn’t buy you an i7-8700k, GTX 1080ti, Z370 motherboard, 1000w 80+Gold Power supply, 32GB of DDR4 3200mhz RAM, a Corsair 570x, and a NZXT Kraken x62 for Valentine’s Day then go ahead and find a new girl because you deserve better, king.
4821 2018-02-22 20:54:14 Ich musste gerade sehr lachen. "Und jetzt machs gut, du wurdest zerstört." Das ist Gold.
4822 2018-02-22 20:54:11 Donald Trump was ratings gold too, he was given billions in free airtime by MSM! Their greed surpasses common decency, no one can dispute that.
4823 2018-02-22 20:54:10 Still little shocked that the gold medal game was determined by a shootout! You don’t win the Stanley cup in a shoot out!#keepplayingsuddendeath #ot #notshootout #Pyeonchang2018
4824 2018-02-22 20:54:08 Just need AC Milan and Arsenal aswell for my acca. Who cares about money this is TV gold
4825 2018-02-22 20:54:06 It’s like the weed biz in Wa.state. The banks are hesitant to process the cash. Fed weed laws and all. Gear up patriots, cash and gold is still king...
4826 2018-02-22 20:54:04 @H1Z1 if y’all could send the gold ak and the gold ar to @Flankxr steam that would be great and it would save a lot of time
4827 2018-02-22 20:54:00 // Nah man. I distinctly remember some gold medals going around the necks of the US Women’s Olympic Hockey Team.
4828 2018-02-22 20:53:54 Can’t get picks this year bud they are like gold
4829 2018-02-22 20:53:47 As they should!!! First Gold in 20 years! Wowza
4830 2018-02-22 20:53:40 "This is what a gold medal-winning team looks like with the right support. We are taking steps in the right direction." I AM SO PROUD OF YOU @HilaryKnight & US #WomensHockey 
4831 2018-02-22 20:53:30 I wish eating was an Olympic sport because I’d win gold

4834 2018-02-22 20:53:16 Remember that NRA was receiving the Russian funding that has been used to divide America and wreak havoc.  This speech is Russian gold - dividing America by race.  Dividing America by party.  Mongering fear and blaming media for daring to cover the ugly truth.
4835 2018-02-22 20:53:14 taehyung who deserves every inch of the universe and its stars and every ounce of liquid love whose heart is made of gold? we dont deserve him

He's a great piece to the ball club. Now if he falls this year I can understand but for someone young he's doing good
4841 2018-02-22 20:53:02 It warms my heart that the US women's #hockey team beat Canada for Gold! Though, not a fan of shootouts... @TeamUSA
4842 2018-02-22 20:52:59 And from what I was told everything glitter ain’t gold

4845 2018-02-22 20:52:57 Lmao @ anyone comparing last nights women’s gold medal hockey match to the Micracle that took place 38 years ago
4846 2018-02-22 20:52:54 Dana Loesch said this: “Many in legacy media love mass shootings,”  “I’m not saying that you love the tragedy. But I am saying that you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold.”  The NRA, folks.
4847 2018-02-22 20:52:53 YES!  @usacurl men’s team is making history as they will play Sweden for their first ever gold medal!  Good luck!  #USA #PyeongChang2018 #Olympics
4848 2018-02-22 20:52:52 So excited see US Women’s Hockey Gold Medal win.  I wonder if officials at the University of North Dakota were watching?  They abolished women’s hockey at UND!   Such a terrible decision!

4850 2018-02-22 20:52:46 They lost a shootout, its not like they got smoked.  Can't win gold every time. Silver is a fantastic result, it's not like we flamed out and didn't medal. Great work out there ladies 
4851 2018-02-22 20:52:46 I love giving people food for thought

Yo to be honest y'all game is trash I lost just now to I player with gold players who were hitting every shot(contested) and my diamond players are missing wide open shot (good full meter releases) don't think I'll ever play 2k again after that this game is ass

4876 2018-02-22 20:51:56 Olympic thresh hold then 15n/g per m/l THC in blood New equipment that tested more precisely caught Ross at 17.8ng/ml. The current limit set by World Anti Doping Agency is 150n/g ml. BillC46 5n/g per ml as criminal impairment. Win gold but driving with 17.8 many years in prison?
4877 2018-02-22 20:51:56 She showed raw, honest emotion. People don't realize how much sacrifice and preparation athletes go through to prepare for the Olympic stage. The optics i get look bad but I'm not going to beat up on a player for showing how she honestly felt about losing a gold medal game.
4878 2018-02-22 20:51:55 Now’s the time to buy up all the gold toes while they’re cheap.
We should all learn from previous hyped releases
4879 2018-02-22 20:51:46 You have a last Aerospace Engineering major that used Arecibo to capture the ISEE-3 satellite, his name is Jacob Gold. He lives in Tucson, AZ now
4880 2018-02-22 20:51:40 On the bright side you still have a chance for gold in men’s hockey.
4881 2018-02-22 20:51:37 I’m glad USA won the gold in women’s hockey. Crybaby Canadian woman ripping off her silver medal is embarrassing

4884 2018-02-22 20:51:30 The thing that people don’t understand is...a real transfer of wealth is about to happen. 

From Barter. To Gold. To fiat. Now to crypto. 

Question is when that happens will you be ready?

4885 2018-02-22 20:51:30 That’s a very valid reason to stay home. So sad

4887 2018-02-22 20:51:28 @JocelyneUSA17 congrats on the gold! Still sour about you taking a chunk out of my ear with your skate in squirts grand forks 
4888 2018-02-22 20:51:28 Now I'm confused.
4889 2018-02-22 20:51:27 Blue or gold? LMAO
4890 2018-02-22 20:51:24 Let's grab a gold switch blade and make us a blood pact, babe, to love, to fuck, to only see ourselves and remember this
4891 2018-02-22 20:51:24 Whenever I see Peter Schiff on TV, I think he should be in full clown garb. Besides Gartman and maybe Kass, this guy is the biggest quack out there. Dollar to zero. Gold to a trillion. Stocks and bonds to zero.
4892 2018-02-22 20:51:21 I’m sorry. I must have missed your communication to your loyal @Starbucks Gold Rewards members when you cut your grocery rewards stars in half. Now 25 bags of coffee to earn a reward?!? Ridiculous.
4893 2018-02-22 20:51:21 Nobody gives a fuck about that nigga but you, DUMMY
4894 2018-02-22 20:51:21 Thank you for spending the time to research.

Yeah, that's basically how I understood Ms. Gold's tweet. Which means that Ms. LePen is using the word "eugenics" incorrectly.
4895 2018-02-22 20:51:15 What kind of crazy law was that 80-20 Rule ?? U import 100kg gold then you will have to export the same-or-some 20% of gold !!! may be at a differen price may be ?? may be only on the papers may be ?? its not a moronic law its profit for their own BUSINESS HOUSES TO GET THEIR CUT
4896 2018-02-22 20:51:14 Congratulations to the USA Woman's Ice Hockey Team on your gold!!!   We are so proud of you!  Great job!!

4901 2018-02-22 20:51:01 Makes it kind of tough. Hoping that these companies will see the error of their ways and disassociate with the NRA. I’m a @Hertz gold member and am absolutely disgusted with them!
4902 2018-02-22 20:50:55 The great thing about 45 is his ability to see how things look. Armed guards look terrible. Armed teachers sweet. Presidents should be tall as his advisors. Cover crap with faux gold and call it priceless. Cover ignorance with bravado is his motto.
4903 2018-02-22 20:50:50 This new @ABHcosmetics @amrezy highlighter is everything, I look like I dipped myself into gold
4904 2018-02-22 20:50:45 Because she acted like a spoiled brat who couldn't get her way in the public eye. She could've waited to have her moment of discontent after leaving the ice. Not everyone gets a gold medal, learn to deal with disappointment and be proud of what you accomplished w/ your teammates.
4905 2018-02-22 20:50:44 lol your schedule is similar to mine... this budden podcast was GOLD lmaoooo

4909 2018-02-22 20:50:32 It’s too big imho if it was slightly smaller and gold it would have been MUCH better
4910 2018-02-22 20:50:30 Canada is too nice to keep taking all the Gold on ice man, have to share sometime. Where’s your (B) men’s hockey team at?
4911 2018-02-22 20:50:27 sou tao de boa, pq querem brigar cmg?
4912 2018-02-22 20:50:22 Geez Oliver... you’ve hit GOP gold. This is bigger than release the memo!
4913 2018-02-22 20:50:21 If you’re talking about men’s basketball, that is a different scenario. Everybody (even the Soviet Union if you pressed them) acknowledges the U.S. was cheated out of the gold medal. Not justifying it, but it was what it was.
4914 2018-02-22 20:50:20 I asked if I could receive the funds in gold bars but it they weren’t having that, then we mysteriously got disconnected. I’m sure they will call back with my money though.

4927 2018-02-22 20:49:47 What a crappy way to decide an Olympic gold medal. Should have continued sudden death OT.

4930 2018-02-22 20:49:42 Great idea. Fraser playing Superman dying could be paired with King Conan with Arnold.

Dana Loesch just won #WhiteRatingsGold and didn't even need to go to #Peongchang2018 

A stunning olympian performance by the #NRABloodMoney spokesperson.
4949 2018-02-22 20:48:46 Pretty sure the last time  won gold at the olympics there were no NHL players there either......then they made a Disney movie about it.

4952 2018-02-22 20:48:39 So I’m driving and Gold Digger comes on. That’s my jam, of course I had to sing along. I look to my right and these dudes are laughing at me. it’s fine. life is great.
4953 2018-02-22 20:48:39 ال pure gold فعلا 
4954 2018-02-22 20:48:37 Watching "3 Chains o Gold" - Prince really fucked up this album; he removed the majority of the rock opera narrative segues to add "I Wanna Melt With U" - the sad thing is, that shit is not even b-side quality.
4955 2018-02-22 20:48:37 I mean I remember the Russian team removing their silver medal after 2000. I think it shows their drive that the gold was the ultimate goal. I think there may be a thin line between disrespect and disappointment. I think this situation is more disappointment than disrespect
4956 2018-02-22 20:48:37 Seems more like rather than cancer being in one big tumor, the individual corpuscles have infiltrated MSM and other platforms, rather than
4957 2018-02-22 20:48:35 @kirkmin It's too bad you guys aren't bigger wrestling fans. Listening to Curtis botch the pronounciations of "Ciampa" as CLAMPA and "Cien" as CLEN on this morning's @KirkAndCallahan show was radio gold!
4958 2018-02-22 20:48:33 Okay here's what I found from The Guardian. 

She talked about a global conservative youth that wants to “protect their children from eugenics, the elderly from euthanasia and humanity from transhumanism”.
4959 2018-02-22 20:48:31 A8 It seems that @familyreach is the best place to go.  They are a gold mine of information to families who desperately need help and to know where to turn. #WBChat #CRFT

4961 2018-02-22 20:48:25 The Founders boys came into the club today. Got to sample their new Solid Gold. All I can say is I am overly impressed with the body in that lager. Incredible brew. #founders #beernews #beer
4962 2018-02-22 20:48:16 I know how disappointed Team Canada's Women's Hockey Team was at not winning Gold. They should be proud of how well they played and all their accomplishments. No one can win all the time, it happens to the best of athletes. U.S.A. has a 20 year drought. Congrats to them
4963 2018-02-22 20:48:16 Ah, the 2012 luncheon with several medalists from the London Olympics on hand. Great time...and I got to wear one of @DelishaMJones' gold medals.
4964 2018-02-22 20:48:14 Yes. And when the money given to schools...lets call it Z...gets decreased, that increases Y% cost.

I'm glad we see how this all works.

Gold star!
4965 2018-02-22 20:48:14 Gold should be played 1st, 2nd, 3rd - 20 5on5 OT, 15min 4on4 OT then I’d still no winner 10min  3on3 till someone wins
4966 2018-02-22 20:48:08 Yes! It’s all one big chain of events there’s so much continuity! That’s why I love past life regression, such a gold mine of understanding and wisdom

4974 2018-02-22 20:47:43 There is nothing wrong with losing.. you learn from your mistakes... Sore losers can one day become champions as well..maybe it wasn't canadias destiny for 5 gold's in a row. There is always next time. 2022.2026.2030..
4975 2018-02-22 20:47:40 @chloekimsnow you were hilarious on Fallon last night:).  Congrats on the Gold at the #PeyongChang2018 Winter Olympics!!
4976 2018-02-22 20:47:33 Congratulations to the USA Women's Hockey Team for winning gold at the 2018 Winter Olympics!!! :)
4977 2018-02-22 20:47:32 Everything that glitters ain’t gold, some of y’all will find that out the hard way
4978 2018-02-22 20:47:31 Since losing the gold medal game... I don’t think Beer, You, and throwing axes is a good idea..
4979 2018-02-22 20:47:29 Well, I guess you get what you pay for.  'Cause he ain't worth nothin'.  Except to the Russians--he's solid gold to them.
4980 2018-02-22 20:47:28 Also, I’ll be rooting for you guys to win Men’s Hockey gold. As an American, it’s against my nature to root for Russia for any reason lol.
4981 2018-02-22 20:47:27 Dangerous white men with guns are gold to the NRA.
4982 2018-02-22 20:47:25 I've been critical of your past struggles, but, gosh, did you guys put it together down the stretch. Congratulations to the team. You deserve your results. Can't wait to see the gold medal match.
4983 2018-02-22 20:47:24 i retweeted and im gold 5 still, what'd you do to me

4986 2018-02-22 20:47:08 Gold medal decided by a shootout is garbage pail kids hockey. Not cool. They’ve waited 4 years to play. Let them win by playing......
4987 2018-02-22 20:47:04 While America was sleeping, something miraculous happened in the Olympics. the US Women's Ice Hockey Team beat Canada and won the gold medal for the first time in 20 years, and no one really seems to care.
4988 2018-02-22 20:47:04 Thank you to the Big 12 Conference. What you call a reprimand we refer to as provocation and with that comes consequences. Your public chiding will not divide us, to the contrary it will make us stronger.
 Let’s Go Mountaineers! @CoachHuggs @WVUhoops @WVUblue_gold

5020 2018-02-22 20:45:34 That women’s gold medal game was incredible. One of the best hockey games I’ve watched. Insane.
5021 2018-02-22 20:45:31 I am 100% all about Americans winning gold - but - as a guy, something about this pic bothers me
5022 2018-02-22 20:45:30 Pujols avg has dropped a lot I agree but 23 HR and 101 RBI last year isn’t too shabby. Also have a gold glove SS and C. And added a 3B with a .297 average and 24 HR. Are there better lineups than us? Absolutely. Would the majority of baseball kill to have our lineup? Absolutely.

5032 2018-02-22 20:45:12 Well done, Koz and NBC. Last night's Women's Hockey gold medal game was one of the coolest sports moments ever. My wife NEVER watches hockey (rarely watches any sports at all) and she was riveted to the TV all the way to the end. Yeah, we're both dragging today but worth it! USA!

5049 2018-02-22 20:44:20 Finally getting my iPhone back today and the rose gold Apple watch I been wanting 
5050 2018-02-22 20:44:16 I’m 63 and it’s still a thrill to watch an American receive their Gold Medal  and hear the Star Spangled Banner 
5051 2018-02-22 20:44:13 You don't "win" a silver medal in hockey. It's the consolation prize for loosing. Even if you are the 2nd best team in the world. Wich is awesome, and you should be proud... but you win the gold or bronze... not silver
5052 2018-02-22 20:44:13 So happy to see @TeamUSA women’s hockey team win gold!!!! #USA #USA #usawomenshockey #PyecongChang2018
5053 2018-02-22 20:44:08 Yes we are! 3rd, 4th, and 5th Graders will earn FSA GOLD!!#Lockhart Strong
5054 2018-02-22 20:44:04 I do have to add though ppl go too far in critique of HIM, all Royals have gold crowns, entourage, nice things (just as churches do,) it's a long, long tradition. He made errors but it doesn't erase the good he did.
5055 2018-02-22 20:44:02 Seven cities of gold is a complete rocker! Gets my vote
5056 2018-02-22 20:43:57 Damm I was tryna do home work I needed one for Xbox my gold had went away and I wanted 2k
5057 2018-02-22 20:43:56 Gold or nothing. Throw the silver away.
5058 2018-02-22 20:43:47 My gold medal event would be glade skiing or x-country skiing #MyGoldMedalEvent - KR
5059 2018-02-22 20:43:46 Im not at that level where I can comfortably spend $500 on some shoes or $4,000 on a gold bracelet... im just not. That is subject to change though. I do know that when I am able to do those things it means I have a paid for home and all my other NEEDS taken care of FIRST

5065 2018-02-22 20:43:36 Great hockey from #WomensOlympicHockey. A huge congratulations to both @usahockey and @HC_Women for an outstanding game last night in  Well-deserved #gold and #silver. Also congrats to @OlympicTeamFI for #Bronze. Loving the 2018 @Olympics!
5066 2018-02-22 20:43:35 I really enjoyed reading Three Feet From Gold. Finishing it the other day gave me the spark to start knocking out the other books on my reading list.
5067 2018-02-22 20:43:34 “So as an Olympic legend, you chose to ski at 3 events in South Korea. You won 3 golds then right?”
“Nope”
“So you won 2 golds?”
“Nope”
“1 gold?”
“Nope”
“You certainly medaled in all 3 events right?!”
“Nope”
“You took home a silver?”
“I got one bronze”
“Legendary!”

5068 2018-02-22 20:43:34 What y’all think It did to Mali when he gave away all that gold ??
5069 2018-02-22 20:43:34 Agree %100. Keep playing. A skills contest event shouldn't decide the gold medal.
5070 2018-02-22 20:43:29 Well gotta set my alarm for 1:30 AM on Saturday to watch @usacurl go for the gold...
5071 2018-02-22 20:43:27 Although if they go hard in the Gold Cup. Might Bite and Native River may well make this happen it could have been a very hard race in the Gold Cup and only 29 days to recover from that rather than the 56 is getting. 

I don't think he's been campaigned well at all.
5072 2018-02-22 20:43:27 I watched the 1st episode the other day & kept meaning to text u about it  that series was pure gold 
5073 2018-02-22 20:43:26 These guys win the gold medal and I want to see a Ticker Tape parade that rivals one from the days of the Mercury Astronauts...
5074 2018-02-22 20:43:25 or is it silver? gold? grey? why he playin
5075 2018-02-22 20:43:17 So if you win a gold medal in the Olympics you get big money or what? How does that work lol
5076 2018-02-22 20:43:17 I am so excited ti watch this. All your harry potter videos are absolute gold.
5077 2018-02-22 20:43:16 It was just as exciting as the men’s gold medal game last olympics. Also, should NHL players be included? It seemed better
5078 2018-02-22 20:43:16 Canada losing women’s hockey and men’s curling to the US was planned gift to our American friends because they have to deal with that orange asshat. Next Olympics we bringing back gold. Ur welcome

5085 2018-02-22 20:42:58 I want a guitar on a pole iron man match. 60 minutes of them just breaking guitars on each other. Ratings gold.
5086 2018-02-22 20:42:58 Way to go #usacurling! Curling is playing for the gold! @TeamUSA
5087 2018-02-22 20:42:56 Or how about she appreciate the opportunity that 99.99%of us do not get and be proud she had the ability to compete for Gold, Silver or Bronze. Expectation is one thing, but entitlement is not the Olympic Spirit. She has a lot of growing up to do.
5088 2018-02-22 20:42:54 I felt the same when I saw the clip. She’s worked hard and wanted to win gold for her country and team. I ain’t mad at her 
5089 2018-02-22 20:42:49 @realDonaldTrump prefers a cock ring to a wedding ring...saves him on all the truckloads of Viagra he needs to consume any time he buys sex from someone unwilling to look at his nastiness otherwise.  

Thank goodness he’s so rich...he could get an incredibly tiny gold one made.

5091 2018-02-22 20:42:42 Brian Orser is strict about jumping passes. He doesn't need a skating parent impacting his team's coaching process. He trained what, three consecutive Olympic gold-medal winning athletes? A complicated situation is something Orser is too in-demand to need or undertake.
5092 2018-02-22 20:42:42 IF I CAN BUY THIS BOOTY BY GOLD AND DIAMOND.

5098 2018-02-22 20:42:37 I would argue that the perfect life, sin atoning death and resurrection is our only hope for salvation.  The empty tomb is but a vessel, but it’s pre-resurrection contents more valuable than gold to the faithful.  Jesus Christ, our risen Lord!
5099 2018-02-22 20:42:36 Body glide anti chafe balm and gold bond friction defense are the ones i’ve seen
5100 2018-02-22 20:42:35 So taxpayers should pay for lecturers gold plated pensions when the rest of the public sector has had their final year salary pensions changed.... You are barmy
5101 2018-02-22 20:42:35 Wow the gold toes have waterproof technology in them
5102 2018-02-22 20:42:34 Arsenal FanTV will be gold tonight.
5103 2018-02-22 20:42:31 @HC_Women I know for you guys job one was to bring home the gold. I’m also pretty sure making Canada proud was right up there too. Although the gold slipped away, our pride in you girls most certainly did not. #proudofyoursilver
5104 2018-02-22 20:42:28 This is gold! Even if it focus on a Cuban-American family, the brilliance of it made me, a Brazilian woman, feel represented too, many times. The Pope was a genius touch, I see so much of my grandma and great-grandma in Lydia! Thank you for this! I'm recommending to everyone!
5105 2018-02-22 20:42:27 Hmmm .. that’s a lot
5106 2018-02-22 20:42:25 Congrats to the U.S women’s hockey team on beating Canada in a shootout! Gotta love watching the U.S.A win gold 
5107 2018-02-22 20:42:24 Your disdain for everything GB has blinded you to the greatness that is The true #12 don’t let those red and gold sunglasses put you to sleep
5108 2018-02-22 20:42:23 Weekend wish: @Kelly_WP kicks the hell out of @itsvedatime and @Melzi87 and gets her title back from @tonistorm_ (Sorry, Toni ) at wXw 16 Carat Gold Tournament 2018!
5109 2018-02-22 20:42:22 I know there like gold dust. I don’t even think I’d have the heart to skate it tbh. I’d probably hang on a wall 
5110 2018-02-22 20:42:21 That's not very gracious.  U.S won gold you won silver - is that so bad?
5111 2018-02-22 20:42:17 今は仕事中だ   あとにしろ
5112 2018-02-22 20:42:12 Nope you dreaming
5113 2018-02-22 20:42:10 He would look good in the Black in gold
5114 2018-02-22 20:42:08 @DLoesch the medial loves white crying mothers, ratings gold and mass shootings? HOW DARE YOU!!! you are not a human & a horrible mother if you think that your precious NRA loves the "blood bath money" you get when gun sells go up after each mass shooting ... swim in that bitch
5115 2018-02-22 20:42:06 I know you will deliver... everything you touch turns to gold!  Love you!
5116 2018-02-22 20:42:04 I'm sure Team USA's gold medalists will be invited to visit the White House.
They should respond one of two ways:
-Accept
-Politely Decline
I hope no one acts like an ass. I'm confident no one will. #Olympics
5117 2018-02-22 20:42:03 Where was this communicated to your loyal @Starbucks Gold Rewards members? You just killed all brand loyalty for your grocery customers.
5118 2018-02-22 20:42:00 And I will say whichever you get, put gold Bruiser on and Gold Defensive Stopper for Booker if you can.
5119 2018-02-22 20:41:58 According to @DLoesch it would be ratings gold.
5120 2018-02-22 20:41:56 Blah blah blah ... she talked about white mothers tears were ratings gold. Doesn’t it seem that it is ratings gold for her ? Yup she is frothing at the mouth LOVING THE ATTENTION
5121 2018-02-22 20:41:55 Gold!
5122 2018-02-22 20:41:54 In defense of the Canadian hockey player who took off her silver medal as soon as she got it:

This ceremony was moments after a heartbreaking loss in the gold medal game in a shootout. Her country had won gold the past four Olympics. She's a competitor who plays to win. (1/2)
5123 2018-02-22 20:41:54 @BrookeBaldwin for 40K a year they have to teach subjects, add on ethics, morals & manners, they’ll throw their bodies in front of your kids, work 80 hours a week, sometimes feeding - exactly how could a teacher, even if they wanted to, manage that?
5124 2018-02-22 20:41:53 I remember my powder days smh. But Bruh yes. Look up gold bond friction defense. It looks like a deodorant stick. Body Glide makes them too
5125 2018-02-22 20:41:53 Yeah I got lilah 14 k gold
5126 2018-02-22 20:41:51 For the first time, USA men's curling team moving on to finals for Gold!
5127 2018-02-22 20:41:44 But I'm a gold digger
5128 2018-02-22 20:41:41 These would be a lot better if the @YouTubeTV red play button was gold too. And their away kits are white. The play button should be black there. Keeping it red looks weird on both imo
5129 2018-02-22 20:41:39 she might win gold tonight 
5130 2018-02-22 20:41:35 So happy for you!!!!

5134 2018-02-22 20:41:13 I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good.
5135 2018-02-22 20:41:10 I think you are referring to gold bugs.
5136 2018-02-22 20:41:09 "So wake me up,
if you see me fall,
don't you let me go,
cause my heart is made of gold"  Permithias. That guy is sleeping on himself man.
5137 2018-02-22 20:41:06 Btw, congratulations on the gold medal. I don't like that we lost, but I respect your team. They were hungrier and wanted this more.
5138 2018-02-22 20:41:05 Look, we need to talk about the DUMB fuckin' prices y'all are selling used Jonathan Richman albums for. 

People, this ain't gold and silver. It's plastic with some songs on it. 

C'mon. 

Jeez.

5142 2018-02-22 20:40:56 US to play for gold in men's curling....Yeah?
5143 2018-02-22 20:40:55 I find it pretty great that the U.S. Women’s Team @usahockey is celebrating their gold in the Czech Olympic house, singing We are the champions and drinking beer. They won their last gold medal 20 years ago, we can all hope that @narodnitym will take their lead and do the same
5144 2018-02-22 20:40:51 Lmao this is fucking gold 
5145 2018-02-22 20:40:49 Doesn’t everyone want a gold medal? Honestly the mindset she has that 2nd isn’t good enough is what we need more of, she’s not happy with the result of the work she put in, she now knows what she needs to do differently to get that gold she wants.
5146 2018-02-22 20:40:48 Nun das kann unser neues #Gold zu 30% nicht.

5156 2018-02-22 20:40:30 While I am bummed out that Canada didn't win, the U.S team must be feeling really great winning their first gold in 20yrs.
5157 2018-02-22 20:40:29 Some people really be acting like your boy until they strut by you with a gold Scar showing them true colors. It's truly a cold world.

5175 2018-02-22 20:39:49 -- later, Emma left the diner and walked the short walk towards the library, halting in her step and pretending to look at her phone when Gold exited the library.  She couldn't risk getting caught.

5179 2018-02-22 20:39:45 Leaving her parents apartment early that morning, Emma headed towards Granny's, deciding to grab a quick breakfast before heading to the library.  She knew Belle never got there that early, for some reason Gold never allowed that to happen. 

 Paying Granny a little while --

5185 2018-02-22 20:39:41 It was a banner day for US Olympic hockey. The women's team won gold beating Canada. And the men's team all averaged four stars in their Uber driver rating.
5186 2018-02-22 20:39:41 are you not doing the gold medal game?
5187 2018-02-22 20:39:40 All the Stars is on repeat.  The whole album is GOLD. This one's special though.

(probably bc of the opening instrumental and bc @kendricklamar & @sza )
5188 2018-02-22 20:39:40 Whoa! USA Men just beat CAN (!!!) and have advanced to the Curling Gold Medal game! 1st time CAN hasn't contested for Gold. Ever.

5198 2018-02-22 20:39:30 The United States is going to the gold medal game for men's curling  just so yall know
5199 2018-02-22 20:39:29 Agree 100%. Impact when Debbie McCormick won the worlds eons ago!  If USA wins GOLD... #BOOM! Good for business #hotshotscurling
5200 2018-02-22 20:39:28 “We have American Curling history!” - NBC Sportscaster. Team USA advances to Gold Medal Match
5201 2018-02-22 20:39:26 And few remember that after we unbelievably beat the Russians we still had to win another game for the gold - and we were LOSING that game before the forces of destiny kicked into overdrive. Makes me proud even thinking about it right now.
5202 2018-02-22 20:39:19 Well you sure are not ratings gold.
5203 2018-02-22 20:39:18 Have you congratulated are gold medal winners #ShitholePresident #lyingliarinchief
5204 2018-02-22 20:39:17 @__ODL__ see you in manc! I’ve got gold!
5205 2018-02-22 20:39:08 If any hockey game it’d be 2008 Gold Medal Canada v.s USA. Damn Crosby!
5206 2018-02-22 20:39:02 I ALMOST BROKE OUT I HIVES but she does have the best co partner in the series tbh that man has a heart of GOLD
5207 2018-02-22 20:38:58 Would be nice if the #gold medal game had teams other than the #USA and #can in this match.
5208 2018-02-22 20:38:51 is a stickler for sorry ass excuses fecklessly searching for an excuse even if I don’t use it. Who's worth their weight in fool’s gold now my psychogenic trollops? #NationalRetardAssociation

5210 2018-02-22 20:38:47 Car SOS, Gold Rush, for me but you need satalite telly, if they still call it that...
5211 2018-02-22 20:38:45 I want to thank you for hurt my feeling. You are a gold digger.
5212 2018-02-22 20:38:44 Did you know...combined winner @michellegisin never won in World Cup? Her best results were two second places. At #PyeongChang2018 she followed her sister @dominiquegisin - she won gold medal in downhill in Sochi. @Olympics #Olympics @fisalpine #Olympics2018 #OlympicGames2018
5213 2018-02-22 20:38:43 so proud of our men's curling getting to first gold medal game 
5214 2018-02-22 20:38:43 catch and shoot and limitless range on gold, deep dead eye range on silver. he is 5'11 and can dribble.
5215 2018-02-22 20:38:38 Yup. Cold and hateful people, brought into forums, show their true colors.
 This same inhumane person said that "school shootings" and "crying white mothers" are "ratings gold" for the NRA at CPAC today.

#NOGUNSinschools #StoptheNRA
5216 2018-02-22 20:38:35 Was so hoping you would make this today’s #BIGPICTURE  It was a great game, and well worth staying up late for!  And to think the American goalie was all of 7 months old the last time the USA Women’s team won the gold - simply awesome!!  
5217 2018-02-22 20:38:31 I see that Rose Reynolds has been added to the gold autograph ORL list, still no Bex?I’m only asking because I want to purchase my photo op tickets ASAP and will buy an autograph ticket if needed but I want to do it in one hit to limit the number of international fees I’m paying
5218 2018-02-22 20:38:31 thank you to the USA women’s hockey team. thank you for being the role model for millions of girls. thank you for giving us people to look up to. thank you for everything you do on and off the ice. thank you for bringing home the gold.
5219 2018-02-22 20:38:31 Kelly Cup > Gold Medal.  Right?
5220 2018-02-22 20:38:30 خش اتوضى وصلى بلا زيت بلا بتاع 
5221 2018-02-22 20:38:28 BUT ...2 of the goals scored in the gold metal game are from North Dakota!!
5222 2018-02-22 20:38:28 I'm so happy that people and media outside of our little bubble of ARMY and kpopers, are appreciating BTS.
They're a little pile of gold that should be shared and celebrated with the whole world 

They give me so much strenght, happiness and motivation every day 
5223 2018-02-22 20:38:27 Just watched John Shuster make history for U.S. Curling. After watching him miss shots match after match for years... he finally delivered. He erased years of disappointment with an amazing stretch. Beating Canada to get to the Gold Medal match was amazing. Now let's win Gold!
5224 2018-02-22 20:38:22 Just made a big ol bowl of popcorn to watch this episode of #TeenMomOG

5231 2018-02-22 20:38:07 It’s a good day when you can end the school day with a gold medal in the desk chair relay.
5232 2018-02-22 20:38:05 Even then it's just been an all white shoe with hints and gold and OVO branding
5233 2018-02-22 20:38:01 cracked my phone screen badly this mornin so went 2 mall to fix it... i had a white screen on before but they didn’t have any more so he put a black one on...w my case it looks good, but w/o my case, black on rose gold doesn’t go well
5234 2018-02-22 20:37:58 Sunrise Beach, here I come! Super excited to meet Bob and Charlotte O’Bryan, whose granddaughter @Bdecker14 is now a gold medalist! They’ll be sitting down with me to talk about what it’s been like to follow her hockey journey.

5236 2018-02-22 20:37:52 Woot for @TeamShuster into the Gold Medal Round for Men's Curling! You guys are amazing us all! #USAvsCAN
5237 2018-02-22 20:37:50 @HC_Women 
Were you sore loosers after loosing Gold? One of your members removes the Silver medal from their neck!! Very poor sportsmanship!!
5238 2018-02-22 20:37:50 Wow the men's Canadian team just got knocked out by USA for the gold medal round in curlling... Well that never happens! USA USA USA!
5239 2018-02-22 20:37:47 Somebody help me find them gold toe 1s please 
5240 2018-02-22 20:37:45 Whoo hoo! @Shoostie2010 on fi-ya!! THIS is your story! GL let’s get gold! #OlympicCurling
5241 2018-02-22 20:37:43 @XboxSupport My xbox gold membership ran out last week so today i went to buy the discounted 3 month membership but it's saying i have to pay £5 first, why should i have to pay for something i haven't received? please reply asap
5242 2018-02-22 20:37:42 I have no idea how curling is played but the US men's team just defeated Canada to advance to the gold medal game.  Congrats guys.
5243 2018-02-22 20:37:41 Nothing about this is poor sportsmanship. She’s angry they didn’t  win a gold. Ah wanted to be the best. She didn’t want that “participation” medal.
5244 2018-02-22 20:37:40 US MEN'S CURLING IS GOING TO THE GOLD MEDAL MATCH!!!!

KNOCKING OFF CANADA!!


5245 2018-02-22 20:37:38 Recently before I sleep I have to listen to the keys on #exiled then dream land can follow... A perfect lullaby

5250 2018-02-22 20:37:31 And all that glitters is gold
5251 2018-02-22 20:37:29 But Ms. LePen is in favor of eugenics. 

I still do not understand this tweet from Ms. Gold.
5252 2018-02-22 20:37:26 True Steve...I cannot understand why we no longer wear the gold and blue away that has done us proud. This blue strip is bad voodoo #AFCVOST
5253 2018-02-22 20:37:21 USA! First time going for gold in Men's Curling against Canada! Way to go guys! — watching Winter Olympics 2018
5254 2018-02-22 20:37:20 So you are saying that @britneyspears helped the @usahockey women win their first gold medal in 20 years! Wooo! #ItsBritneyBitch
5255 2018-02-22 20:37:19 @cryptopirlo Our boy @PutinRF_Eng stacked up some #Gold
5256 2018-02-22 20:37:19 And according to Dana Loesch the NRA spokesperson, “Many in legacy media love mass shootings. You guys love it,” “I’m not saying you guys love the tragedy but I am saying you love the  ratings,” “Crying white mothers are ratings gold”. RATINGS GOLD!!!
5257 2018-02-22 20:37:18 Ugh I really shouldn't have bought this because I got a new controller with the X1X....but...just so pretty....

The gold "tooth" is what sold it.

I love getting texts from @8Corbett saying she got gold and is moving on to offsa, I could not be more proud
5261 2018-02-22 20:37:07 Watching the women's gold medal hockey game last night I had a bad feeling midway through the third. USA took charge and Canada seemed to just be hanging on. In OT they looked totally gassed. I don't know what happened, but USA deserved it. #OlympicHockey #TeamCanada #USAvsCAN
5262 2018-02-22 20:37:07 #TeamUSA Curling! The guys are going on to compete for the GOLD!!!!!
5263 2018-02-22 20:37:06 Team USA Men's #curling going to play for the Gold Medal. I'm stunned. This is simply fantastic. And they took out Canada.
5264 2018-02-22 20:37:04 Ostersunds look like Swansea in them kits with the gold numbers. They never did very well at The Arsenal did they?
5265 2018-02-22 20:36:59 Go #USA!! Off to the gold medal game! #curling #USAvsCAN
5266 2018-02-22 20:36:57 my pussy glitter as gold
5267 2018-02-22 20:36:55 Hey for everyone at BC that watched and enjoyed the Women's gold medal game last night: @BC_WHockey plays at Conte all the time, and @TheBostonPride are down the road. Pay attention! Don't forget about Women's Hockey in non-olympic years! /rant
5268 2018-02-22 20:36:55 So the gold medal curling match starts at 1 am MT. @ColoUte are you going to stay up, or try to get some sleep before waking up for it? #USA #curling
5269 2018-02-22 20:36:54 Ребят, послушайте сейчас меня и попытайтесь понять. Если вам звонят, то не игнорируйте, если просят, чтобы вы приехали - не отказывайте. Видимо, вы нужны этому человеку в данный момент, так будьте снисходительны, черт возьми.
5270 2018-02-22 20:36:54 @NickWilson923 The US is going for the gold tonight in Curling, and all you can talk about are the Cavs, Browns, and Tribe ?
5271 2018-02-22 20:36:53 My source says AQUAMAN has a very RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK vibe...in the best of ways (Meaning...not in an ALLAN QUATERMAIN AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD way).
5272 2018-02-22 20:36:51 But did they say that "a crying Mom is ratings gold" And "the media loves mass shootings"???? 
Nope that was you.... And it's below disgusting!

5274 2018-02-22 20:36:47 I'm not a fan of the new trend where someone with a viral tweet hits the "add another tweet" button, and like says "Thanks, check out this other thing I do", it reminds me of Reddit where users edit their post "Thanks for the gold"
5275 2018-02-22 20:36:46 赤「どうしよう……。オレさ……、凄いことに気がついたんだ…。ゴールドって、凄く可愛いって事に……！」
5276 2018-02-22 20:36:43 I hope the USA wins the gold medal for #curling 
5277 2018-02-22 20:36:40 Gold star.
5278 2018-02-22 20:36:36 Network effect, continuous innovation & adoption. It's not going away, any more than the internet is going away, or gold is going to cease having value. It's becoming increasingly integrated into the social consciousness.
5279 2018-02-22 20:36:28 I always feel sad when I hear Heart of Gold come on the radio

5282 2018-02-22 20:36:23 It's funny how Trumpers quickly condemn a person when they call a Marine "crusty" (gasp!) but look the other way when Trump attacks POWs, war widows and Gold Star families.
5283 2018-02-22 20:36:22 Gold star should be given if he actually did something for them, but he won’t.
5284 2018-02-22 20:36:18 2 of2 he also was paid by goldrush and wasnt paying all his employees(ones not on camera) his family is also being investigated by IRS. there is a Facebook page Concerned homeowners of park county. Also another is a former employee Gold rush gossip.
5285 2018-02-22 20:36:17 For canada just to be in the convo is amazing with that less of population let alone have more gold medals
5286 2018-02-22 20:36:15 I wish I had gold hoops
5287 2018-02-22 20:36:14 You don't win the Silver medal it is given #USAvsCAN #Gold #usa

5301 2018-02-22 20:35:44 Yea offcourse i always send my funds to other adres (other private key) so i only use empty private keys. OK great i will try because bitcoin gold is the last one i claimed. Al the other free money is still waiting for me :-) but lcc is already claimed yes :-)
5302 2018-02-22 20:35:43 Exactly!! We sometimes have a hard time seeing any color that isn’t gold in curling or hockey!
5303 2018-02-22 20:35:37 @Bdecker14 If there was a Gold medal for Take aways you would get it. What a firecracker you are Great game and thank you for your dedication, determination,  sacrifice and most of spirit. Moments Such Sweet Memories
5304 2018-02-22 20:35:37 Ah sorry!!! Then I entirely agree with you! But the number of people who still think university staff have gold plated pensions and months off in the summer are depressingly legion...
5305 2018-02-22 20:35:37 Did you know they make chafing sticks??? Like gold bond I think has a stick you rub in the areas to prevent it. I was so amazed when I found out

5309 2018-02-22 20:35:27 Yeah you didn’t watch any other games except that one when their in the gold medal game

With open eyes, I'm starting again
Before you go I think you should know the world is your kaleidoscope
5311 2018-02-22 20:35:21 Best time of the year. Any advice for first time to see Amstel Gold Race and then Liege the following weekend? Never been to either.
5312 2018-02-22 20:35:21 But what we really should be mad about is a gold medal game in a once in four year tourney be decided in a shootout. Now that really grinds my gears, it’s bad enough in world juniors but even worse in the olympics.
5313 2018-02-22 20:35:20 If we can convince CNN that a revolution of thoughtful debate and considered action is ratings gold then it might just happen.
5314 2018-02-22 20:35:18 Nope, too exciting to fall asleep. After though, then 3h later off to work! No rest for the weary...

5316 2018-02-22 20:35:13 But the next day what does the paid NRA shill say? "Grieving white mothers are ratings gold" for media. She's despicable. Why didn't she say THAT at the town hall, since that's what she/the NRA believe. She's despicable.
5317 2018-02-22 20:35:13 @BigDrewandJim 
Who thinks they wouldn’t have watched that game last night if it went into 3OT?  We all would have roughed a no sleep day to see Kendall Coyne go top shelf at 4am to win gold.  If I could do it for the Professor in 02, I would do it for the ladies last night
5318 2018-02-22 20:35:12 ughhhhh. smh. i’m the canadian player who was called a sore loser bc she took off her silver medal right after they put it around her neck, lmaooooo. that was OUR gold. (but also congrats! but also i part of me is still bitter and doesn’t really mean it)
5319 2018-02-22 20:35:09 hearing that other sororities have roasted me in their chapters is GOLD
5320 2018-02-22 20:35:00 make the shoulders garnet and keep the design gold. Also go with the gold helmet. We fail at getting these uni combos right. Lol
5321 2018-02-22 20:35:00 Trump has repeatedly & vocally shown disrespect to heads of state, elected officials, the FBI, gold star parents & the handicapped & you laud him for it. You’re full of fake news AND fake outrage, Comrade.

5323 2018-02-22 20:35:00 Been a privilege to watch you guys play. Best team by far through the tournament. Best of luck for Gold.

5330 2018-02-22 20:34:32 I know that everyone else has already said it, but why is it that the gold medal game in the olympics can still be decided by the shootout? It takes away all the fun, watching your team lose because a forward came straight down on JUST your goalie no one else
5331 2018-02-22 20:34:30 tRump saying that Active shooter drills are a Negative thing' is idiotic,  this coming from a very insulated man living in a Gold tower surrounded by armed guards!  #BanAssaultWeapons #standwiththekids #NeverAgain

5333 2018-02-22 20:34:28 Gold Coast Light Rail: Too many ignorant people, dirty feet and shoes on the seats. Let's issue a few fines, publicise the fact, and poor behaviour will soon vanish. We need to look after this wonderful infrastructure before it gets tatty.
5334 2018-02-22 20:34:27 Idk where your purple and gold is but I’ll be WEARing mine tonight!!:)
5335 2018-02-22 20:34:27 A huge congratulations to both @usahockey and @HC_Women for an outstanding game last night in #WomensOlympicHockey. Well-deserved #gold and #silver. Also congrats to @OlympicTeamFI for #Bronze. Great hockey! #womenshockey @pyeongchang2018 @Olympics #goodgame
5336 2018-02-22 20:34:18 I guess that lipgloss was a bad idea it’s too gold for what I wanted
5337 2018-02-22 20:34:18 Congrats to my fellow Chicago girl @KendallCoyne and the rest of the women's @usahockey team for winning gold last night. 
5338 2018-02-22 20:34:13 NEED A GOOD LAUGH/I THOUGHT WHEN 20 MINUTE OVERTIME WAS OVER IN WOMENS HOCKEY/I THOUGHT THE USA AND CANADA BOTH GOT GOLD MEDALS LOL/NEVER HEARD OF SHOOTOUT/EXCEPT WITH GUNS

5340 2018-02-22 20:34:09 Hey @Nike can you talk to @usahockey about making some gold medal merch
5341 2018-02-22 20:34:06 So sad my Ariel watch from @empukofficial has gone silver after a few wears it's meant to be rose gold 
5342 2018-02-22 20:34:06 He never seemed to have a problem with disrespect when trump insulted...senators, reporters, women, children, gold star families, veterans, immigrants, Muslims...
5343 2018-02-22 20:34:01 Congrats to the USA women's hockey team for the gold medal win despite using skating super-clones to do it.
5344 2018-02-22 20:34:00 The neighbors of everyone of his mines have lawyers with cases against his company. Alaska and Yukon mining authorities (mshaw) have banned him from ever returning for failure to perform reclamation and the fact he never followed the rules. Its all public record. 1 of 2
5345 2018-02-22 20:33:59 Unfortunately there can only be one winner and I know it takes a lot of talent to be an Olympian (both mentally and physically).  After  training 4 years to win gold - she was just disappointed.  I’m happy for our US team that had to wait 4 years to finally win this.
5346 2018-02-22 20:33:57 @mauriciomacri Hola presi, una idea yo vivo en Nueva Zelanda, y los mayores de 65 años no pagan mas el bondi. Taria bueno que en Arg tmb. Tienen una sube gold que los identifican.¿Que decis? ¿Lo podes hacer?

5348 2018-02-22 20:33:55 I’ve apparently just saved Imogen’s life. I deserve a gold star.
5349 2018-02-22 20:33:53 @AskPlayStation I have seen the new PlayStation gold headset come to stores in the USA but I have not seen any sign of the new headset coming to Canada. Can you please tell me if it will be for sale in Canada and if so when and where I will be able to get it
5350 2018-02-22 20:33:44 it went gold though

5355 2018-02-22 20:33:32 So we just gon act like Jim didn't just say "spilled maple syrup." While he was referring to Canada not getting a win in the gold medal game? On @BigDrewandJim

5357 2018-02-22 20:33:24 Truthfully, I wanted to win gold at last year's Grand Prix Final, too.
5358 2018-02-22 20:33:17 Hey @Spotify, thanks for introducing me to @vcsleepclinic today by putting "Someone to Stay" on my "Daily Mix #2". Just listened through all of Revival and *phew* what a pile of gold you've got there! 
5359 2018-02-22 20:33:14 Either the Gold or the Everyday Cuppas! I change every day for a bit of added excitement!

5364 2018-02-22 20:33:09 Princess Ayela had been reading bedtime stories to herself since she was a baby. She could count all the gold in the treasury by the age of 2, and play every instrument by 5. At 7, all she wanted was to become a Princess Scientist. Must face naysayers, tigers and poacher #PBPitch
5365 2018-02-22 20:33:08 Yes tbh if I wanted one that doesn't fade I know where the gold shop is. We buy this shit to look good for a while b4 throwing them away when they fade...
5366 2018-02-22 20:33:03 Shits gold 
5367 2018-02-22 20:33:01 i just waited in a target for a bus for 10 minutes and didn’t buy anything. where’s my gold medal
5368 2018-02-22 20:33:00 Interesting how she ignores the fact that these mass shootings are also sales gold mines for guns.  What's the NRA incentive to try to stop them?

He's respectful to Gold Star families, people with disabilities, his "African American friend", Clinton, Cruz, Rubio, and Sanders. Get your head out of your *ss.
5371 2018-02-22 20:32:45 To the people that think they can’t be seen picking their nose in the car.....why do you use your pinky? You’ll never get the gold doing that!
5372 2018-02-22 20:32:38 Supposed to be an awesome game. I don't doubt it. Gold medal games between USA and Canada tend to be quite awesome.

5380 2018-02-22 20:32:18 Hockey to Canada is like no other sport. You win gold you win bronze. Let this young woman alone. We're so proud of them all, she and other teamates were just broken hearted...remember this was ours for 20 years that's a huge responsibility.

5398 2018-02-22 20:31:32 In less than 10 games I went from silver IV to silver II 50lp playing basically only jungle. With the mid items I’m ready to bring my favorite champs like Annie and Ziggs to farm to win. Woo! Gold here I come!
5399 2018-02-22 20:31:29 Congratulations to the #USA Women's hockey team for winning gold! What's your favorite sport to watch during the #WinterOlympics?

5403 2018-02-22 20:31:22 It's as if they don't understand what it takes to complete them. Monthly rewards are terrible and you have to play all 25 games every weekend of the month to get them. Close to 100 games played and the best we can do is 2 packs of gold cards if you finish gold 1 or 2...

5408 2018-02-22 20:31:07 All this going on about curling in #WinterOlympics..... I could've won gold for the one I curled out in the bog earlier!

5412 2018-02-22 20:30:58 “Crying white mothers are ratings gold.” — Dana Loesch, mouthpiece of the @NRA, a trade association that exists to promote the sale of guns, and all-around poor excuse for a human being.

5414 2018-02-22 20:30:52 Just like the Medical cuck combined fear people take MMS (chlorine dioxide) to oxidize fungi,toxins, etc to heal many disease. Or 2nm-24nm colloidal gold .
5415 2018-02-22 20:30:49 towns of gold are still too little
5416 2018-02-22 20:30:48 And for Loesch to say “crying white mothers are ratings gold to you” was worse than anything LaPierre said, which is awful.
5417 2018-02-22 20:30:44 Crying mothers may be gold to the media, but your tweets are gold to the NRA and gun industry. Focus on the lives of children.  The NRA can defend itself.

5420 2018-02-22 20:30:41 See, where'd you hear that? I really thought that live episode was odd. He and the other men were never in the same room. It was like he was being supervised.
5421 2018-02-22 20:30:40 @SteveSchlanger @ChadSalmela Your call of @jessdiggs powering her way through the klaebo-baaken to lead the US to its first cross-country skiing Olympic Gold Medal will rank up there almost near Al Michaels calling the Miracle on Ice 38 years ago! #PyeongChang2018
5422 2018-02-22 20:30:37 I'm thinking of getting rose gold nails when I go get my nails done. I could technically get extensions but I wanna wait until my natural nails grow out a bit longer for them to look good
5423 2018-02-22 20:30:31 And that's gold
5424 2018-02-22 20:30:24 Our love is gross but I'm covered in gold, gold, gold... 
5425 2018-02-22 20:30:23 If he wins gold you owe him an apology for calling him a piece of shit

5432 2018-02-22 20:29:59 Greg Louganis hitting his head in the board and coming back to win gold in 88. I loved to go diving after that. Michael Johnson completing the double in the 200 & 400m in 96, and then the last couple of days with the cross country women & women's hockey team.

5439 2018-02-22 20:29:46 Really hoping they go with gold font for the YouTube logo on the LAFC jersey. These “leaks” are kinda bumming me out.
5440 2018-02-22 20:29:44 @mduggan10  congrats on winning the gold!

5444 2018-02-22 20:29:43 The current cap appears to be 237. I suggest you use Custom World creation to check on each biome individually, the ones where you encounter a fair amount of white regular quests are likely also hiding some gold bricks quests. It does get very time consuming.
5445 2018-02-22 20:29:43 Lol you want to involve chirps about murders and police?! It’d probably take as long as it took your ladies to win gold before we ran outta ammo with you guys. Pun intended
5446 2018-02-22 20:29:38 Kenlin always says she wants to play hockey like her dad @MikeMcKenna56 . Until the Olympics she didn’t know girls could really play. Congrats @EmilyPfalzer and @usahockey Women’s team on the gold and showing my daughter there’s a place for her in hockey. She was so excited!
5447 2018-02-22 20:29:36 I was in the city one day and saw an armored truck that was carrying Maple Syrup. It's as valuable as gold over here.

5466 2018-02-22 20:28:53 I’ve been watching a lot of Moira gameplay VODs because I feel like Moira/Zen and Moira/Lucio are gonna be big support duos for next season. And you know, god forbid teams actually pick two supports in Gold.
5467 2018-02-22 20:28:52 It's one thing if I need to lower my spending.Another thing if I don't make enough money and work 40+ hours and STILL fall short on my rent. I obviously have no money. Some people barely make it and look like GOLD.
5468 2018-02-22 20:28:52 Hey, @NHL, you gonna tweet a congratulations to the USA women’s ice hockey gold medal winners oooorrrrr nah?
5469 2018-02-22 20:28:48 Never get fed up watching this on gold.
5470 2018-02-22 20:28:40 That shit slaps 
5471 2018-02-22 20:28:35 Digital commodity ≠ gold.

The intrinsic value of gold ≠ valuation of a digital commodity.

Digital commodities are not scarce. Deflation ≠ scarcity.
5472 2018-02-22 20:28:35 Woah...The highlights from the CAN v USA women's #Olympics2018 gold medal hockey match.  What a game! Well done to all.

5475 2018-02-22 20:28:22 My comments were  relating to politicians not academics !
Doubt politicians would give up their gold plated pensions without a fight.

I don't blame academics fighting for their interests .

5483 2018-02-22 20:27:59 Have to say I like the outcome... however a gold medal game coming down to a shootout is kinda dumb should be OT till it's over
5484 2018-02-22 20:27:58 Pls don’t leave out any of the tea this is gold

5490 2018-02-22 20:27:49 Shortly after USA Women’s Hockey taking home Gold Medal:

“Name of that pornstar? Abella?”

“Abella Danger”

“Not True, I would’ve remembered Danger”

Next day, annoyed about missing on proper jerkoff session:

“Thought you were messing with me, I could’ve had a gold medal beat.”

5496 2018-02-22 20:27:34 Could have been worse. Dude from team Sweden threw his silver into the crowd following the world juniors gold medal game back in January.
5497 2018-02-22 20:27:27 Omg I just read the thread! Hahahaha. Damn
5498 2018-02-22 20:27:27 My friend ordered a rose gold one from them before and it’s nice af! We need to try this
5499 2018-02-22 20:27:23 As supportive as I am of Canada and womans hockey, it was a great game and effort from both teams.....The USA played one heck of a game and deserve the gold. Canada needs to work a bit harder but a great show
5500 2018-02-22 20:27:19 This story is ratings gold hence the neverending coverage.  When trump was ratings gold during primaries and election everything he did was broadcasted
5501 2018-02-22 20:27:17 Oh, no doubt about it, it was a thrilling game and was a seminal point in US Men's Hockey Olympic History.  It also allowed us to compete for the gold medal, so it is not like it is a worthless event.  It just wasn't the gold medal game. :)
5502 2018-02-22 20:27:16 yeah.. i had a good last day tho.. 3 of those that give 8 gold.. Though now realizing i forgot to souldbound the back item.. #Smart

5512 2018-02-22 20:26:52 You’ve struck gold

5514 2018-02-22 20:26:47 Congrats to USA Women's Hockey team on winning gold at Peyon Chang Olympics!!! #USWomensHockey #WomenRule
5515 2018-02-22 20:26:45 Hey #USA! You can take away our #curling. You can take away our #Hockey. But you can't take away our #Poutine! Congrats to the #usawomenshockey on their long-awaited victory and #Olympics2018 gold medal. See you in 4 years.
5516 2018-02-22 20:26:44 Accidents happen Joey! Didn't it take 5 Olympics to win a Hockey Gold by the U.S. girls & in a "shootout" at that- cheesy way to win #TaintedU.S.HockeyGold
5517 2018-02-22 20:26:41 Guess she should have scored the winning gold goal!!
5518 2018-02-22 20:26:38 @elizabethforma you would win gold in the autism community if you joined the #StopTheShocks team! #Canton #JRC !!
5519 2018-02-22 20:26:36 How do you sleep at night? "Many in the media love mass shootings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold." No empathy for the mothers crying at all. The issue is to address why the mothers are crying...not the ratings.  I actually wonder if you have a soul.

5522 2018-02-22 20:26:28 Gold Present isn't running.
5523 2018-02-22 20:26:26 What happened to "Hey Team USA won!" And "Hey we won a gold medal!" Makes no sense why anyone would be upset about that
5524 2018-02-22 20:26:23 You also can’t have your “friend” NRA representative Dana Loesch saying callous, painful, race baiting remarks like, ‘media loves mass shootings’ as ‘crying white mothers are ratings gold.’ Some friend...
5525 2018-02-22 20:26:18 Yeah that sounds pretty butthurt, making a joke about the slaughtering of innocent children. .... I’ll just take the Women’s Hockey Gold  and the win over your Men’s Curling  team and walk away. (Seriously tho, how do you lose at curling... )
5526 2018-02-22 20:26:15 I think it’s more than feasible. It’s a fact. Chandler is a borderline Hall of Famer, IMO. NBA Champion, All-Star, All-NBA Team Member, Defensive Player of the Year and Multi-time All-NBA Defense, 3 Gold Medals and longevity (17-year career & counting).

5531 2018-02-22 20:26:07 Ok as in yes, or ok as in I’m not answering your question because I don’t like it and I’m going to ignore it like it was a silver medal in the gold medal women’s hockey game?

5533 2018-02-22 20:26:03 I mean, they do typically “bite” the medal wen they win gold so it could hold true if you did that and tripped or something? Maybe? If it’s cheap material or silver coated chocolate? Ok probably not.

5545 2018-02-22 20:25:30 Sure the women's hockey team beating Canada to win gold for the first time in 20 years is impressive but I managed to eat a salad at work while everyone around me had Popeye's so where is my medal?
5546 2018-02-22 20:25:27 If that were Trudeau, he’d be using taxpayer money to make sure it was pure gold #TrudeauMustGo
5547 2018-02-22 20:25:22 I can’t wait to find out your take on Booster Gold
5548 2018-02-22 20:25:22 It’s not similar at all. One was against  a Cold War rival that had previously won the past 5 or 6 gold medals. This was just against a decent team that we haven’t beaten in a while.
5549 2018-02-22 20:25:22 I have an account in gold on Ow who wants to play lmao
5550 2018-02-22 20:25:22 Tengo que reconocer que me gusta mucho "Neil Young: Heart of Gold".
5551 2018-02-22 20:25:17 You're right. And you're right that CNN considers this tragedy to be "ratings gold" for them, as they haven't stopped talking about it since it happened.
5552 2018-02-22 20:25:16 I def need to watch the delay play of that women’s gold game cuz whew that goal is nice
5553 2018-02-22 20:25:15 Men's #IceHockey Team are the only hope to win one of the biggest values of #Gold 
5554 2018-02-22 20:25:14 We haven't.  Its been a inevitable downward spiral for about 5 years now - in the hope of hitting gold - which we finally did, then Hodgson did his usual thing, and next we know, the FA have bankrupted us.
5555 2018-02-22 20:25:07 I’m feelin like that’s Mom... the outfit is just so dang similar, down to the color scheme, the gold belt, and the gold detail on her epaulets to match the gold arm straps on her dress
5556 2018-02-22 20:25:07 は〜どっこい
5557 2018-02-22 20:25:05 we question our worthiness of particular wins, as we begin to seek outside validation for a head nod of clarity when instead, we should be looking within to see the glass full and overflowing with gold potential.

5559 2018-02-22 20:24:55 "Crying white mothers are ratings gold," says NRA's Dana Loesch.  This is vile.  She is an embarrassment to women.  We are better than that. Shame on her!  SHAME ON HER!!
5560 2018-02-22 20:24:54 In Olympic hockey it's always been immediately after the gold medal game. I wasn't referring to other sports.
5561 2018-02-22 20:24:54 I like the ones that kept the gold on. 
5562 2018-02-22 20:24:53 Congrats on the gold, you ladies are the greatest.

5569 2018-02-22 20:24:30 I like that number, I've dipped in a little higher with some good luck lately.  Depends on what's happening as to whether I pick gold, silver, ES, or CL.  Everything is moving together on my screen  (not good).
5570 2018-02-22 20:24:29 As heartbroken as I and other Canadiens are about the women not taking home the gold at Peyongchang, it's great to see the American women conquer after the abysmal past year they had dealing with USA Hockey.

5574 2018-02-22 20:24:26 I guess she said they were yelling “burn her”but people that were there said they were yelling “shame on you”! Dana Loesch has no shame! She latter said “media loves mass shootings,crying white moms are ratings gold! How despicable can someone be?
5575 2018-02-22 20:24:23 The gold helmets are growing on me though, probably with the maroon jerseys 
5576 2018-02-22 20:24:21 Was it really the just gold challenge? You 100% used diamonds

5581 2018-02-22 20:24:08 Well done to the US Women's Hockey Team on winning the Gold Medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeonChang. How disgusting to see the Canadian Team with such glum faces. I will call them the Canadian Team, the Canadian Cry-Baby Team from now on.
5582 2018-02-22 20:24:05 /you're solid gold i'll see you in hell/

5584 2018-02-22 20:24:04 So sad to know this soulless human is a mother, shaping the lives of our future! Would she consider her years to be “ratings gold” if it were her kids the world was talking about. Sickening!

5610 2018-02-22 20:22:52 With that logic we should only reward gold medals. No 2nd/3rd place finish. The Olympics differ on a more grand scale over all sports because athletes are vying to be the Top 3 in the world. Winning a silver, bronze or gold holds more prestige then the Stanley Cup or Superbowl

5614 2018-02-22 20:22:38 I can't stop watching that move by Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson in the shootout from last night's women's gold medal hockey game. One of the best I've seen, ever.
5615 2018-02-22 20:22:35 She like d way I move I don’t need gold chain
5616 2018-02-22 20:22:33 @BigDrewandJim 
While i hate shootouts to decide Gold medal games, can we just take a moment about the goals scored.  We got a Canadian doing the “Forsberg” and a Kessel doing what all kessels do and roofing top shelf.  But the Lamoureux goal was so filthy I felt dirty after it
5617 2018-02-22 20:22:32 Dumb founded by the glow of your gold halo, oh god i can't believe i'm staring at a living angel

5619 2018-02-22 20:22:30 looking @ 20 yo skaters i can’t help but think that by that time yuzu’s already been through an earthquake, had an olys and worlds gold medal, was a record holder and had that terrible accident @ coc. and i don’t want to downplay the others it’s just that he’s been through a lot
5620 2018-02-22 20:22:28 This reminds of the US 100m backstroker in the '96 Olympics who won the gold medal but pouted on the victor's stand because he didn't break the world record. I think, later on after he grew up, he regretted that behavior.
5621 2018-02-22 20:22:27 Wow. Dana Loesch NRA spokesperson really said this? " The media loves mass shootings Crying white mothers are ratings gold."Shameful !

5625 2018-02-22 20:22:17 何をしている  変態がッ！
5626 2018-02-22 20:22:15 Biometria é tão boa que mesmo não cobrada na norte identificou torcedor da Gold. Que maravilha.
5627 2018-02-22 20:22:15 Cant wait for this bought myself and my mate a gold ticket!! Roll on April 
5628 2018-02-22 20:22:14 He must be cheating. I've seen him hit gold 1 like myself every week. The DKT is easy af.
5629 2018-02-22 20:22:12 The DCEU needs to just call it quits and start over. They have no idea what the hell they want to do. Struck gold once with Wonder Woman and that’s pretty much it. Playing catch up with Marvel was a mistake from the very beginning. They could’ve done it much better, too. Shame.
5630 2018-02-22 20:22:12 Gold has near-zero intinsic value as a non-monetary good. It’s just social consensus. I don’t see your point.

5634 2018-02-22 20:22:04 I’m kinda excited to go home and wipe my kids ass and feed him gold fish.
5635 2018-02-22 20:22:00 It's because she didn't win silver .. she lost gold.   This is done in the world of soccer a lot .. the losing team rarley accepts their 2nd place medal on their neck but usually just reaches out for it or they remove it immediately.  No biggie.  Congrats USA
5636 2018-02-22 20:21:59 He has since changed his opinion, he says anything past season 27 is gold
5637 2018-02-22 20:21:57 THIS IS GOLD
5638 2018-02-22 20:21:56 You're just chasing that Olympic gold bb
5639 2018-02-22 20:21:54 Y’all don’t like the new nipsey???????   SMH
5640 2018-02-22 20:21:51 @NicolleDWallace wow! CPAC harpy & paid talking parasite making America grate on our nerves again?
They wrapped their venomous fear speak a pretty wrapper. But like stinky cheese.
Wrap it in all the gold foil you want. It's still stinks to high hell.
Many will eat it though.
5641 2018-02-22 20:21:43 "not to chase gold, but to become golden"
5642 2018-02-22 20:21:40 Glad she didnt win Gold. I’ve played sports my whole life and have been in this spot. But I would never be that much of a sore loser and poor sport to disrespect the Olympics by removing the medal 1 sec after it was put on. You can still be mad u lost but do it with respect.
5643 2018-02-22 20:21:36 Las olimpiadas de la cryptomonedas, petro, petro gold y cuidado no se vienen también petro silver y petro bronze, y toda la mierda que se les pueda ocurrir!!!

5649 2018-02-22 20:21:24 No... Dana Loesch said it’s ‘ratings gold’ if you have crying white mothers on TV
5650 2018-02-22 20:21:19 There is such a thing as 'too much gold', my dear.

5653 2018-02-22 20:21:13 Prof.Jega's opinions are not sacrosanct about the institution and the earlier he realizes that the better for him. As per high costs of conducting elections, we still remember so vividly how he kept asking for supplementary budget reimbursements which he got on platter of gold.
5654 2018-02-22 20:21:08 Ser gold também já foi
5655 2018-02-22 20:21:07 I did, too, until she showed her hand be saying that "crying white mothers are ratings gold".   She wasn't there to participate, or to listen.  She was there to pick up talking points for her CPAC appearance and make HERSELF appear heroic to conservatives and the NRA crowd.
5656 2018-02-22 20:21:06 Yo I need a size 13 Gold toe for like $220. Plug me 
5657 2018-02-22 20:20:52 The series is so massive but every volume is great. I’m just BARELY finishing Gold and Silver
5658 2018-02-22 20:20:42 Well how on earth could you not watch after this offer ? Heart of gold  and darn talented too
5659 2018-02-22 20:20:41 Congrats @JocelyneUSA17 @moniquelam7 @Cayla_barnes27 @EmilyPfalzer and the rest of the team on winning GOLD! Proud of you guys! I’ve seen a lot of the hard work you’ve put in and this is well deserved! #USA  #PyeongChang2018
5660 2018-02-22 20:20:40 Eh, you all do see that Gold joined Twitter on the 16th of this month, and that literally every tweet is a right wing talking point or retweet of right wing talking points, right? 

Not even worth snarking at.
5661 2018-02-22 20:20:37 It's national Margarita Day and the US  Mens team is playing for a gold in curling! Forget these twits!
5662 2018-02-22 20:20:36 Now playing on the @mastercatsdjs show on @6townsradio with @johnnyfstoke is @ToshioMatsuura "I Am The Black Gold Of The Sun" find @brownswood
5663 2018-02-22 20:20:32 I like the gun giving elder predator better than the super predators. Plus Gary Busey is gold.
5664 2018-02-22 20:20:32 I hope Team Canada gets the same backlash for crying that Team USA got in 2014 after losing the gold medal match. It’s only fair.
5665 2018-02-22 20:20:31 Loving all these icymi tweets about folks pumped for the gold medal game.
5666 2018-02-22 20:20:28 Gotta say. All quips from Canadians I follow about healthcare and gun violence because of the gold medal game is really disappointing. Joking about people who die because of poor gun control and not having access to medical care it's some funny response to losing a hockey game.
5667 2018-02-22 20:20:28 @DSmithShow & @JordanCarruth What about the USA cross country skier that won gold? I would think that’s bigger than US females hockey! #Olympics2018
5668 2018-02-22 20:20:24 I’ve been trying to get a shoutout from the @Avalanche for awhile. So all I have to do is win a gold. Got it.
5669 2018-02-22 20:20:24 Haha, no problem - tv gold that!

5674 2018-02-22 20:20:11 Because the idea came from you, anybody else would've gain 20 times gold on reddit, but nobody likes you.
5675 2018-02-22 20:20:04 @KinTips regarding your video,"Full Review Activeon CX Gold with comparisons and with/out external mic" what microphone did you use and where can I purchase one?
5676 2018-02-22 20:20:03 Similar to when Barack Obama was called America's No. 1 gun salesman, CNN, MSNBC, and other media's ham-handed, hyperbolic anti-2nd Amendment propagandizing is fundraising gold for the NRA and political manna from heaven for Donald Trump.
5677 2018-02-22 20:20:02 Murad, if you don't see the difference between gold and digital commodity - I can't help.
I can't put complete economics neither in 280 characters, nor 2800 characters.
5678 2018-02-22 20:19:59 NRA bitch, Dana Loesch,"Crying white mothers of shot up kids are ratings gold."

And WE outnumber YOU.
And we're coming for you.
5679 2018-02-22 20:19:52 Congrats to the USA women's Olympic gold medal hockey team so proud of you all
5680 2018-02-22 20:19:51 He wontbe there lol
5681 2018-02-22 20:19:51 Fantastic. When he's President of Planet FALC I'll supplement my Basic Income by regaling everyone with the tale as they sit around gold pools being served by robo-butlers.
5682 2018-02-22 20:19:46 @Bernstein_Goff people in the US seem to be forgetting McKayla Maroney and her reaction to not winning the gold
5683 2018-02-22 20:19:46 Isso, acabei de ver aqui. É o 6 mesmo e é gold, rsrs
Eu realmente não me atenho as cores porque vive na capinha
5684 2018-02-22 20:19:45 I still can't believe I got to watch the United States win Olympic Hockey Gold
5685 2018-02-22 20:19:44 Feeling really good that a cross country coach will now be able to carry a solid gold desert eagle to school
5686 2018-02-22 20:19:43 ‘72 USA basketball team didn’t accept their silver medal. That was do to a horrific call by the ref. I can see the same type of dissatisfaction with shootouts. USA & Canada really tied for the gold yesterday.
5687 2018-02-22 20:19:38 old but gold =)
5688 2018-02-22 20:19:28 @DSmithShow 38 years ago today was the Miracle on Ice too....same day the Women won the gold.

5692 2018-02-22 20:19:02 I have him check out the SWORD she has for 5000 gold. It's a LONG SWORD+1. I have her S)ELL both and LEAVE. I have 6 RAINBOW DASH go in and have him I)DENTIFY the scroll she has for 250 gold. It's a scroll of KATINO.
5693 2018-02-22 20:19:01 What about the effects of a president who lis constantly, pays off porn stars and insults Gold Star Families?
5694 2018-02-22 20:19:00 Bye then
5695 2018-02-22 20:18:56 Was this your "squirrel" moment? Gun ranting tweet after tweet and then ooooh hockey, gold, women, flag.
5696 2018-02-22 20:18:55 Question. How does this show human trafficking? I dont mean to make light of this situation, but that scenario just means the girl is just playing around with him, a true gold digger. I would know.
5697 2018-02-22 20:18:55 A pessoa n saía do gold na season passada e já ta challenger nessa. Ok né
5698 2018-02-22 20:18:52 My gold controller still works. I was playing Rampage with it a few weeks ago. 
5699 2018-02-22 20:18:49 No, there was 3 judges that gave V/M a perfect report card while the others had lowballed V/M- there was even 1 judge who didn't give out any 10s to V/M. Yes, you can argue that for P/C as well since the judge didn't give out any 10s but V/M's FD did have Olympic gold moments
5700 2018-02-22 20:18:43 Content is subpar. Drop limited and only way to get packs without purchasing is WL. It's just disappointing this year. Yeah said wanted LTD. But now we get LTD without solos, and UL promo with only sets. Need another log solos sequence with packs not jsut 16 solos one gold  plus
5701 2018-02-22 20:18:43 That was because Bambam forgot her lines... She was suppose yo introduce the rappers with that voice twisting thing but she did not even get there.. Teddy A too was dump founded... Wouldn't blame Nina and Rico that much.
5702 2018-02-22 20:18:40 Ratings gold for media? Or defenseless, grief-stricken, point-blank targets for the NRA? The lack of empathy here is disheartening.
5703 2018-02-22 20:18:38 Wow what does it matter to the trolls.  This young lady is upset that they lost.  She is disappointed for not winning the Gold.  That's what they were there for.  She didn't want the participation medal she wanted the Gold.  Nice to see a pissed off competitor.
5704 2018-02-22 20:18:37 Seriously old is gold. Where the world is going digital, top notch innovation lab is going chalkborad side. Loved it. Support the nature and what it made for us.
5705 2018-02-22 20:18:37 WATCH Team USA claims gold in women's ice hockey ending Vincent's reign. More from PyeongChang2018…
5706 2018-02-22 20:18:34 I like that a Princeton-Harvard graduate is trying to pass himself off as anti-intellectual because he thinks his constituents are idiots who can’t tell the difference between a pot of gold and a bucket of shit.
5707 2018-02-22 20:18:32 We all got that one friend that turns around and looks even when you tell them “don’t look now”  #EastEnders
5708 2018-02-22 20:18:29 With the way heart gold and soul silver were made, it would take 47,000+ years to get all 3 starters shiny. Odds being 1 in 500,000,000,000+ .
5709 2018-02-22 20:18:28 So, The US is good at Curling now?

US Men are in the gold medal match
5710 2018-02-22 20:18:24 The fact I can’t retweet these comedy gold tweets upsets me 
5711 2018-02-22 20:18:18 Fact- men did not even compete for a medal
Fact- women won gold
Fact- a lot of freaking people watched that happen 
Fact- if that offends you to the point of having to tweet women that they aren’t as good as men in sports then you are sexist. It’s literally the definition.
5712 2018-02-22 20:18:18 @JIStrange gold!

5714 2018-02-22 20:18:02 The history of California is a mirror of the history nation from the Spanish, to Sir Francis Drake, the gold rush, Donner Party, and more. But modern California is not a place l can recommend anymore and l am a resident.
5715 2018-02-22 20:18:02 @TequilaArette owns its owns fields and is named after a Mexican horse that won 2 gold medals on the 1948 London Olympics
5716 2018-02-22 20:18:01 It did....and it's cleared the rocks in the top field...*taking your hand in mine*
5717 2018-02-22 20:17:57 If there was an office Olympics I'd win gold in a game I call "Bluetooth or Broken?" where you have to guess if the guy talking to himself in a low voice has a bug in his ear or finally snapped
5718 2018-02-22 20:17:52 A little early morning printing for the Highline High School Purple and Gold Basketball game. Team shirts and a few "Thank you Mugs"

5720 2018-02-22 20:17:41 I just saw his other replies. I don't agree that they're terrible of course just that I 100% understand why she took off the medal. Especially when you're playing the USA, the goal is always gold.

5725 2018-02-22 20:17:19 eu falo muito de boa na inocência, sem segundas intenções e tem gente que procura um motivo pra isso ou aquilo
5726 2018-02-22 20:17:15 But when Trump attacks POWs ("I like men who weren't captured") and attacks soldier widows and Gold Star families, we look the other way, right?
5727 2018-02-22 20:17:15 It’s OK. You can make it up to us by swinging by on the Gold Medal Tour.
5728 2018-02-22 20:17:14 I LEAVE and go to B)OLTAC'S TRADING POST. I have 1 APPLEJACK go in and have him I)DENTIFY the STAFF she has for 5 gold. It's a STAFF. I have her S)ELL it and LEAVE. I have 4 RARITY go in and have him I)DENTIFY the ARMOR she has for 750 gold. It's a BREAST PLATE+1.
5729 2018-02-22 20:17:03 Niggas love fake glasses. Y’all be throwing on some 8.99 gold colored frames from H&M with a pair of basketball shorts and slides and call it aesthetic
5730 2018-02-22 20:17:02 I’m one of you all who prefers gold star 
5731 2018-02-22 20:17:02 You don't need a gold plated statue or medallion to know how good you are. You're a very talented man, Mr. Woods.
5732 2018-02-22 20:16:58 My Twitter is overcome with sexist pigs today. It’s like some men are actually butt hurt the women won gold because it somehow takes away from the “men are superior in athletics” argument so their way to combat that is to tweet me with how women in sports is not realistic
5733 2018-02-22 20:16:55 Which do you say you’re going to, a Cookout or Barbecue? 
5734 2018-02-22 20:16:54 facebook gold baby!!!!
5735 2018-02-22 20:16:53 Will there be a re-broadcast of the gold medal game?  I’d love to watch it again.
5736 2018-02-22 20:16:44 my brain: did you really stay up until 3am watching hockey knowing full well that you had a test at 10?
me: you bet
my brain: are you dumb? 
me: probably 
#TeamUSA #Gold
5737 2018-02-22 20:16:43 #ScottMoir winning gold in figure skating and then getting drunk at a hockey game and yelling at the refs is the purest distillation of the ineffable essence of what it means to be Canadian. #pyeongchang2018 canada #CANvsUSA

5740 2018-02-22 20:16:32 O nie, już miał być koniec na dzisiaj, a tu taki super kolejny odcinek i będzie Pan Gold
5741 2018-02-22 20:16:24 Have you ever practiced for four years to get ready to compete in the biggest stage as the world? Ever? Then maybe you dont understand the raw emotions she displayed. Maybe you dont understand the gold is all you want 2nd or third place isnt acceptable. Raw emotions.

5746 2018-02-22 20:16:18 Can leave out the tears last night, after an OT and a tied shootout, when our 20 y/o locked in a gold medal for Team USA! #waterworks
5747 2018-02-22 20:16:17 It is simply more Voorhees grandstanding, desiring a gold star for finally crossing the finish line and repairing things that everyone else on the network repaired long ago.

5750 2018-02-22 20:16:00 USA Women’s hockey won Gold against Canada last night. 7 hours later, USA Men’s Curling stunned Canada in Curling to get a spot vs Sweden in the Gold Medal game. I haven’t stayed up past 1 AM in a super long time but I’m gonna try to watch the whole match Saturday morning.
5751 2018-02-22 20:15:57 .@talkSPORT bang on the money today. funding sports which we have a chance of winning a medal in is scandalous. basketball gets no funding cause we wont win gold but has more people playing it. said it before and say it again the money spent on winning gold medals is wrong
5752 2018-02-22 20:15:57 @VeniceMase @JeanieBuss @LAIreland the first ten minutes have been gold with Jeanie. You can cut the tension with a knife

5754 2018-02-22 20:15:56 Unfortunately, the "Miracle on Ice" game was only in the semifinals.  The American men went on to win the gold medal game against Finland in a fairly quiet fashion.
5755 2018-02-22 20:15:56 Maybe this guy should contact Chris Powell @Gold_AntiTrust...
5756 2018-02-22 20:15:53 If these final salary pensions aren’t affordable in the private sector how can the public sector afford them. When are MP’s going to give up their gold plated pension and join the masses these schemes are no longer affordable. I don’t think any MP would vote to end gravy train
5757 2018-02-22 20:15:51 So we won a Gold Cup! So chuffed for all of us who waited patiently and so appreciative of @noelwilliams03 and all the team at Churn Stables. Big thanks also to @BenjoEvans
5758 2018-02-22 20:15:49 This point governance is not paying their bills, family is being pressed by them accepting public cash , gold jewels as donation, wish fulfull
5759 2018-02-22 20:15:43 your soul is gold xo
5760 2018-02-22 20:15:42 Not all glitter is gold and not all people are humans.
5761 2018-02-22 20:15:38 Hahaha mate your comedy gold
5762 2018-02-22 20:15:31 "Ladies and gentleman, that is the conclusion of overtime. The gold medal will now be decided by a shootout."
“Booooooooooo!”- the entire arena, as @marcorubio silently pumps his fist at home
5763 2018-02-22 20:15:30 金枠までやってGOLDなら一生クイックにこもっててwwwww
5764 2018-02-22 20:15:30 In defense of #JocelyneLarocque, deciding a Gold Medal via shootout sucks.

5766 2018-02-22 20:15:28 My "record label" assures me that there is currently no budget for a hedonistic outing in Australia to "get my head together " mid-album... this is just unreasonable. Also I need a solid gold Ferrari. #StudioLife #MusicIsLife #ShabbyRoad #recording

“yeah well I have 2 Stanley cups!!”

5773 2018-02-22 20:15:10 Well done US Women’s hockey on Gold!! Incredible penalty shootout!! Commitment beyond the pale from both teams
5774 2018-02-22 20:15:07 She’s setting me 
5775 2018-02-22 20:15:05 I just saw CNN put “crying white women are ratings gold” this is what the business is. If white Tears can’t stop bullets . Just let the robots come.
5776 2018-02-22 20:15:05 What did u do with Nat tom brady ? & do u think champ Bailey is worth 5 gold tokens & 3 elite tokens ?
5777 2018-02-22 20:15:02 Hope the Rangers watched the Ladies in the Olympics win the Gold!! Maybe they will learn a thing or two.

5779 2018-02-22 20:14:46 Nederland heeft in totaal slechts tien (top)shorttrackers. En toch #gold, twee #silver en #bronze in #PyeongChang2018. Zoals Suzanne Schulting zou zeggen: 'Niet normaal'. Of 'f*cking bizar'.
5780 2018-02-22 20:14:46 If he were to give the NRA back their $3million and refuse to take any more money from the gun lobby, and lobby for sensible gun control, THEN we can give him a gold star.
5781 2018-02-22 20:14:41 @MaxineAlderton THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS EPISODE WAS PURE GOLD #RobronReunion
5782 2018-02-22 20:14:40 Journal at 8:37 AM, Decided to go southeast, found some gold rocks.
5783 2018-02-22 20:14:37 Honestly can’t believe the gold medal game was settled in a SHOOTOUT. What kind of bs is that.
5784 2018-02-22 20:14:34 That last run from Anna Gasser to win #gold in the #bigair was incredible
#WinterOlympics2018 #PyeongChang2018 #AnnaGasser
5785 2018-02-22 20:14:30 Canada lost the gold in women’s hockey..so sad
5786 2018-02-22 20:14:30 Well said. Without knowledge of past accomplishments, it is difficult to imagine what is possible and realize one's true potential. Africa's biggest mistake was adopting the culture of greed. The painful lessons of our past is cultural gold! Our wealth is in our wisdom.
5787 2018-02-22 20:14:29 Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day
To seek the pale enchanted gold.

5793 2018-02-22 20:14:18 Against all odds I somehow see Zhenya getting gold, Zagi 2nd, Kaetlyn 3rd.
5794 2018-02-22 20:14:16 I don’t think the “Gold or nothing” mentality is the same thing as “We only deserve gold”.
5795 2018-02-22 20:14:16 love getting support in gold games, you should be able to buy an item that forces your teammates to stay close to you, or at least on the same side of the map lategame >.<

Enfim, obrigada pela observação

5801 2018-02-22 20:14:01 hey, you guys have won gold in curling the past few years, and we beat you, this is a big thing
5802 2018-02-22 20:14:00 @DompyGaming 

Bro, next time you have to do the 3 golds challenge, try Donovan Mitchell at the point. Played awesome (29/5/4)

Ran this for starters (all Moments cards):

PG - D. Mitchell (gold)
SG - Shumpert (silver)
SF - Simmons (gold)
PF - Kuzma (gold)
C - Bender (silver)
5803 2018-02-22 20:13:58 So @PullingPitches were in a game both had gold scars, I disconnected and he wound up winning 
5804 2018-02-22 20:13:55 Congrats to you and your teammates on a fantastic gold medal victory!! Wow!!  #proud
5805 2018-02-22 20:13:55 What a performance by the US Women's hockey team, so proud of all you Ladies for bringing home the gold medal!
5806 2018-02-22 20:13:54 Absolutely agree. It takes the focus from the team and places it on the person. They were not cheated out of Gold. The US team won it fair and square. I'm sure the rest of the team is upset as well, but they managed to keep the medal on.  Go Army. Beat Navy. :)
5807 2018-02-22 20:13:52 You know times are truly changing when, in my lifetime, #TeamUSA Women's #IceHockey and Women's #CrossCountrySkiing get gold before the men. And children are brining us to task about keeping them safe #StudentsStandUp. #WomenAndChildrenFirst
5808 2018-02-22 20:13:50 Gold!!!
5809 2018-02-22 20:13:48 @MySoccerAfrica I won't be surprised if Simphiwe Dludlu' #bantwanabantwana bring the gold back to SA, she's a winner!
5810 2018-02-22 20:13:44 Imagine wildin’ out to God’s Plan w/ gold boost OVO’s lol
5811 2018-02-22 20:13:44 True, but the guy has a very toxic view on the team. I’ve gotten both silver and gold at provincials and as much as it sucks it really is an amazing accomplishment at the end of the day. His view is the team lost and they’re terrible, which I don’t agree with.
5812 2018-02-22 20:13:39 No but I did know he wrote the theme tune to the Going for Gold quiz show ;-)
5813 2018-02-22 20:13:38 I love that everyone is excited about #TeamUSA women winning their gold medal — but can we keep the excitement going outside the #Olympics too? Cheer and support the @NWHL. Those players that competed last night deserve a great league and they need their fans support there, too!
5814 2018-02-22 20:13:36 Da tweete ich seit 5 tagen aktiv Sachen und schon 1x Gold und 1x fast Gold

5817 2018-02-22 20:13:25 I am the favorite to win the Gold Ak, gimme gimme
5818 2018-02-22 20:13:19 Thank you for your sacrifice and Service, Sir. Will be cheering you on to Gold

5824 2018-02-22 20:13:04 winning gold in a shootout, might as well put an asterisk beside it.

5857 2018-02-22 20:11:54 It was a dreadful shout to go for the Haydock race as opposed to an open looking Gold Cup. Very little upside in the former shouldering topweight in the Haydock soup. Even if he had won it, you'd have thought maybe Gold Cup was better option?
5858 2018-02-22 20:11:49 A final shoutout to @StephanyaCatalf . It's too bad Canada only won silver. They lost the gold, but the women in the honkey team must feel pretty proud of themselves regardless.

5893 2018-02-22 20:10:14 When it comes to hockey, you don’t win silver you lose gold. Especially since the last time Canada lost was 20 years ago, that’s why it’s so major.
5894 2018-02-22 20:10:12 anyone giving Rubio a gold star for going is too easily swayed. he is adressing his constituents. that is his JOB. he does not deserve these small claps for showing up.

5899 2018-02-22 20:10:02 I'll never get over that time Ireland won gold at the Olympics for show jumping and we had to give it back cos the horse was on drugs
5900 2018-02-22 20:09:57 監督！これはどういうことなんだ！
5901 2018-02-22 20:09:56 How are more people not talking about David wise's sucking all or nothing gold medal halfpipe run. Seriously unbelievable. #PyeongChang2018 #gold
5902 2018-02-22 20:09:56 There's a reason I don't come back to the town of black and gold. I don't think wouldn't survive 
5903 2018-02-22 20:09:44 omg that's where i'm trying to get because the gold is so ugly.......but also i don't wanna be this high in general 
5904 2018-02-22 20:09:42 Fantastic standard at our Yr 5/6 Mini Basketball Finals tonight and congratulations to the 10 teams that qualified to take part. Well done to @StJoHighfield (Gold) @BedePrimSchool (Silver) and Swalwell / Emmaville (sharing the Bronze) #slamdunk 
5905 2018-02-22 20:09:40 But i'm gold
5906 2018-02-22 20:09:33 My tweets are gold 
Y’all just suck at mining
5907 2018-02-22 20:09:33 If you’re mad at Jocelyne Larocque for taking off the silver medal and looking dejected, please tell me how’d you react after losing such a high-pressure game where IT WAS DECIDED IN THE SHOOTOUT. Working so hard for so long for the gold & not getting it... (1)
5908 2018-02-22 20:09:29 @SAS How about the SAS Go Light Fare? Can I check in one luggage for free when I'm Star Alliance Gold?
5909 2018-02-22 20:09:27 Platina e diamante é fácil, quero ver upar do bronze ao gold solo
5910 2018-02-22 20:09:27 Everybody's running to @RobinhoodApp just on the basis of no fees but everything that glitters ain't gold. My only problem @CoinbaseSupport is having to wait 7 days for my coins.
5911 2018-02-22 20:09:26 Just remember; reality is an illusion,  the universe is a hologram, and buy gold!
5912 2018-02-22 20:09:25 I’ll go w option 5. Didn’t even know they played, didn’t know they were in the gold medal game, and found out when I was driving to Dunkin this morning and heard @fred_huebner talking about it....
5913 2018-02-22 20:09:23 Actually the gold/silver medals are always awarded immediately after the conclusion of the game.
5914 2018-02-22 20:09:22 Tive que tirar do foto do cara o jogo todo no setor gold sentado e jogando campo minado no celular, ISSO EM UMA FINAL DE RECOPA !
5915 2018-02-22 20:09:22 i still can't believe we have a #Gold medal in #Shorttrack #olympics #ned wauw #suzanneschulting
5916 2018-02-22 20:09:20 That deke last night to win the gold could have competed in any shootout men or women's hockey
5917 2018-02-22 20:09:20 I’m sorry you have this opinion and we disagree. Especially after winning a gold you should understand how difficult a feat it is. And disrespecting the other team, the host country, and the Olympics overall by your crybaby antics isn’t a way a previous champion should react.
5918 2018-02-22 20:09:19 Happy Morning After Staying Up Until 2:30 AM to Watch the US Women's Hockey Team Win Gold. #caffeineThursday
5919 2018-02-22 20:09:18 the day after the gold medal game, nbc afternoon coverage features curling

nice
5920 2018-02-22 20:09:18 Why would you bother dobing in curling of all sports. I mean you could be as fat as a fool and still come home with a gold medal! 
5921 2018-02-22 20:09:15 سيدي ياسيدي
5922 2018-02-22 20:09:13 You are herby awarded the 1st ever Golden G-Man Award. You are GOLD in our book!
5923 2018-02-22 20:09:13 Honestly boo, all of the ringtones do that to me now, but this one takes the gold cause whenever I’m out and I hear that shit I flinch 
5924 2018-02-22 20:09:12 JAAAAAAAAAAAAA, Micha, Go for Gold!!

5925 2018-02-22 20:09:01 Cheering for the US but think she will take gold.  So breathtaking to watch her perform.
5926 2018-02-22 20:08:55 I think the gold medal game should be sudden death...but they definitely won fair and square...
5927 2018-02-22 20:08:53 os menino ficaram me chamando de bb gold no dia da festa agora pegou, todo mundo me chamando assim KKKKKKKKKK ai caceta msm
5928 2018-02-22 20:08:51 Going For Gold! Forgot about that. In 1988 I had my first job at NatWest and watching the lunchtime showing of Neighbours in the staffroom was the best bit of the day.
5929 2018-02-22 20:08:48 Don’t forget he will make a surprise appearance at the Olympics. Gold medal hockey game?
5930 2018-02-22 20:08:47 good luck Team Sweden - looking so good at the OLympics! win the GOLD - wishes from Canada...
5931 2018-02-22 20:08:47 And Biden got the gold.

5933 2018-02-22 20:08:45 I agree. Gold cards should be potent, and gold faction cards should be potent with a particular flavor. they were on the right track with vernon but completely lost their way.
5934 2018-02-22 20:08:44 Congrats to @HilaryKnight and Team USA Hockey for winning the Gold Medal over Canada last night 
1 Happy USA Fan here
5935 2018-02-22 20:08:41 AWESOME YOU GO LADIES CONGRATULATIONS ON WINNING A GOLD MEDAL IN THE WOMEN'S HOCKY USA USA USA!

5939 2018-02-22 20:08:31 Rod’s “bad goalie” comment was gold. Smith’s “crap sandwich” was as well
5940 2018-02-22 20:08:29 Ditto, also it that the new beta for the RT site? If it for Double Gold members only or can regular gold members opt in, the chat function seems really cool.
5941 2018-02-22 20:08:27 I love how cocky Americans are now after winning one gold for the first time in 20 years??????????????? lol.
5942 2018-02-22 20:08:14 Look at these awesome patients who just got their braces off. They deserve a gold medal!
5943 2018-02-22 20:08:13 very gold boy today, morning
5944 2018-02-22 20:08:11 That moment in #BaggageClaim when #PaulaPatton tells senator-wannabe convenient-wife-seeking #TayeDiggs “I just don’t trust black Republicans” & he turns to potential voters to protest “I’m actually Libertarian” is a nugget of comedy gold.
5945 2018-02-22 20:08:08 AS A SEASON TUCKET HOLDER FOR YEARS - 4 Gold I must say it’s time to try different. Some say you need to Earn It. Tell me WHO’s EARNED It this YEAR. KASSIAN/MCDAVID/ KHAIRA - Give them 4-8 games with no change. Challenge Them! LUCIC - 3rd or 4th line. Challenge him
5946 2018-02-22 20:08:06 Нет, я понял, о чем ты. Но это типа надо постараться, а что я блять могу?
5947 2018-02-22 20:08:00 Congrats to my good friend @Cayla_barnes27 on winning the Gold Medal with USA  at the Olympics
5948 2018-02-22 20:07:58 @MartinSLewis a friend has to sell a gold coin and asked for help as he’s not on the internet. My mind boggles with all the sites wanting to buy but not sure where would be safest and best return. Can you please help point us in right direction? TIA

5950 2018-02-22 20:07:53 Well, looks like I'm eating crow for this year at least. After 2010 and 2014 I didn't think he would be able to turn it around, and now he's going for the gold, getting silver at worst. I take none of my words back, but for this year at least, my angry words are over
5951 2018-02-22 20:07:51 Basement Jaxx’s The Singles album is still absolute gold
5952 2018-02-22 20:07:45 Congrats @NRA that was the gold standard of craven, inaccurate bullshit.
5953 2018-02-22 20:07:45 What a game!! #USWNT brought home the #GOLD. You deserve it, ladies @TeamUSA @usahockey
5954 2018-02-22 20:07:42 It was like around Christmas time and I was like Ima get shorty a gold necklace 

It was a white gold elephant. Real gold and shit
5955 2018-02-22 20:07:42 To your original point, Gold is 7-9T but you don’t use it as currency at the supermarket.
5956 2018-02-22 20:07:39 Is Ruben Neves the best player wolves have ever had wear the famous gold and black?
5957 2018-02-22 20:07:39 I personally think that “mercy” has one of the best beats ever crafted

Also going for classics “gold digger” is hard to pass up
5958 2018-02-22 20:07:31 Conditions are gonna be bowler friendly so quality players like Sanga are gonna be like gold dust.  Admittedly he can be a hindrance on mega roads where hackers become heroes.
5959 2018-02-22 20:07:30 You know, I’m starting to think Kanye wAs calling her a gold digger

5961 2018-02-22 20:07:23 Yea but it’s also awesome the US won Gold!!!!
5962 2018-02-22 20:07:21 At the end of the day I think adidas is doing a great job putting kids out there. At the same time club directors let the parents know what division your guys are playing Gold/Sliver both are great opportunities.
5963 2018-02-22 20:07:14 Andrew Garfield Spidey was a prettyboy cocky douche. It's good to have the real Peter back in theaters, even if they aged him back down. Again.
I want to re-read Spider-Man and Deadpool because it was so accurate to his heart of pure gold in the comics I have to......
5964 2018-02-22 20:07:13 i have all maxed commons and i don't donate them because the gold i receive from chests doesn't count against my donation limit (i think? )

i hit the limit daily because i donate most of the rares
5965 2018-02-22 20:07:11 I noticed watching live that she took it off, thought maybe she was readjusting it or something. What a choad. Sorry you didn't win 5th straight gold, we all feel so bad for you! Super lucky 4 years ago to win
5966 2018-02-22 20:07:08 Karen's on benefits n Keegan has a gold iPhone.....sounds about right  #EastEnders

No gold, no gold, no gold ...
5968 2018-02-22 20:07:06 I watched Gold last night. Avon has lost it. He's a sociopath. And it's bloody brilliant.

5971 2018-02-22 20:06:57 Now that Donald Trump is attacking violent video games, surely the Gamergate hordes will disavow him for daring to level criticism at their gold-standard genres of their favorite medium. Ethics in journalism, right?
5972 2018-02-22 20:06:53 I'm really disappointed in myself that my nap made me miss the Gold medal game for the women.  Anyways... Congratulations to the US Women's Olympic Hockey team for bringing home the gold!

5978 2018-02-22 20:06:41 I've said it before, I'll say it again - a @Psych_USA comic. There's a gold mine sitting there. @IDWPublishing should go after that license and put you in charge of it.

5990 2018-02-22 20:06:12 The ladies on the #usawomenshockey team are badasses. Congrats on a great win!  #OlympicGames2018 #USA #Gold
5991 2018-02-22 20:06:06 Was not very classy :( but it's hard in the moment to acknowledge this will be great for women's hockey. (& the minnesota wild can't catch a break in NHL. time the gophers brought back gold to the State of Hockey.) canada would kill for Title 9. NCAA/USA has best female athletes.
5992 2018-02-22 20:05:59 Gucci album lol
5993 2018-02-22 20:05:58 The Gold's Gym app is undergoing maintenance and is temporarily down. We will be back soon!
5994 2018-02-22 20:05:56 And they say he’s better than “Somebody wey get somebody “ 
5995 2018-02-22 20:05:54 So are you saying no one should be invited if they didn’t win gold based on the actions of a few?  You do know we had military athletes that trained while serving our country that placed lower than 10th.  Are they losers also?
5996 2018-02-22 20:05:54 Let me guess the basic double GG in gold?

6000 2018-02-22 20:05:46 Gold x 
6001 2018-02-22 20:05:44 There’s no limit to how long she can lie to herself that “he’s going to change.” But lying to her about 2 gold medals and a billion dollar business venture has a pretty short shelf life.
6002 2018-02-22 20:05:42 Only let down was you not winning that basketball competition :P

Kiddin of course! You were feeds gold! Thanks for making all of us laugh!!
6003 2018-02-22 20:05:41 Ilya Kovalchuk, the slacker of all slackers in hockey, will probably win a Gold medal this year because he was too much of a slacker to play in the NHL.
6004 2018-02-22 20:05:39 Do you ever think about how you went to the same high school as Maddie Rooney and shes excelling with that gold medal and you’re just sitting at a state college crying because you’re in debt
6005 2018-02-22 20:05:37 If someone leaves, you get their Gold medals even after the match, but if that happens after the match, it doesn't count for cards
6006 2018-02-22 20:05:34 But we don’t know they won the gold! That’s what’s so infuriating. I yell at my TV every time the movie ends because there’s no confirmation.
6007 2018-02-22 20:05:33 In other words were gold in school shootings too? Tight
6008 2018-02-22 20:05:32 News: @CSUFootball’s Spring Game set for April 21, 12 pm MT. It’ll be the first Green and Gold Game at the new stadium. #CSURams

6012 2018-02-22 20:05:17 I have just ‘followed’ @meurigraym. One of the best blokes I ever worked with at the NFU and a bloody good President. Pure Pembrokeshire gold!
6013 2018-02-22 20:05:14 Evening. Thank you for your continued support. Twitter is the gateway of spreading the awareness. People like you are like gold as you are helping Callums journey complete x
6014 2018-02-22 20:05:09 no like there’s special missions to get to the next level, it’s in a gold box in the corner of the home screen.

6023 2018-02-22 20:04:37 @BigDrewandJim 
That was a fantastic game, but can we please stop shootouts to decide Gold medal games?
Still think Canada played a better game.  US was sloppy with the puck in their own zone, and let Canada dictate how the US played.  But Rooney has Freakin ice in her veins
6024 2018-02-22 20:04:36 At one time @RealJamesWoods was Box office GOLD and studios were throwing scripts at his feet! They knew if he was a part of their films, it was guaranteed money in the bank!!
6025 2018-02-22 20:04:35 It being superior to Gold in 5 out of 6 ways, is enough to justify PROBABILISTIC SPECULATION than it might replace it... enough of these Speculators and it becomes true.
6026 2018-02-22 20:04:35 whoa I really like the harsh brightness of the gold colors in this one
6027 2018-02-22 20:04:30 yeah but then its the same as the new dandelion. It should do both - destroy an ambush and play a card from deck. That might be a good thing - faction gold should be slightly better than neutral. It wont ever whiff, but is especially good vs ambush.
6028 2018-02-22 20:04:27 There was a gold medal for a lady on shorttrack, unexpected victory
6029 2018-02-22 20:04:26 $VEC missing from the list of accomplishments. Hopefully indicative of communication via the #ASX today? $GOLD $DRC
6030 2018-02-22 20:04:24 And again, sadly, gold underperformed when this currency pair 'goes the wrong way'
6031 2018-02-22 20:04:24 Way to be Mens USA curling Team Shuster. Started 2-4 and then won four in a row (beating Canada twice) to move on to the Gold Medal game against Sweden!
6032 2018-02-22 20:04:23 @CMartinezVillar pure gold 
6033 2018-02-22 20:04:16 Fridays I don't go to my internship so an intern that's only in on Fridays shares my office and I think he hates me because I decorated the office in all pink and gold and a bouquet of flowers Uriel gave me. I wonder what his probation clients think when they come in to see him
6034 2018-02-22 20:04:10 Good morning to everyone, especially Gold Medalist Maddie Rooney
6035 2018-02-22 20:04:08 All the retired cat daddies go to the gym at this hour. It’s hilarious to see them peddle on the bike with their gold chains and hi-tube socks on, saying wussup to each other.
6036 2018-02-22 20:04:03 Revised Poll: What drew you in to last night's Gold Medal game?
6037 2018-02-22 20:04:02 So it IS true! Awesome!
6038 2018-02-22 20:04:01 @aelfblockchain gold night
6039 2018-02-22 20:04:00 IMHO, "they" know MMT and use it for corporate welfare & MIC, but relegate spending 2 a public purpose to gold std rules.
6040 2018-02-22 20:03:59 The UK banking system relies on other peoples money as does the corrupt bank of England relies on other peoples gold to inflate its export statistics.
6041 2018-02-22 20:03:58 Who's trying to stay up all night tomorrow to watch the USA go for gold in curling starting at 3 a.m.? 
6042 2018-02-22 20:03:56 Yeahhh! I remember that. Ceefax on 'proper' telly (to entice you to buy it). Daytime telly didn't peak until circa 1988. Neighbours & Going For Gold. 
Quality.
6043 2018-02-22 20:03:55 Lindsey Vonn literally STINKS and she gets celebrated like the queen of US female athletics (aside from Serena who actually is) and it makes no sense. 4 Olympics and she has one gold medal give it a fucking rest already.
6044 2018-02-22 20:03:44 I feel like I saw this recently and felt it was neither wheat nor gold colored. Now I need to double check!
6045 2018-02-22 20:03:40 My fave Olympic moments so far in no particular order: Women's hockey gold, Nordic ski relay gold, Czech snowboarder who won ski gold and didn't know it. Nice work, Gals. Competing hard and having fun.
6046 2018-02-22 20:03:35 To, gold,
6047 2018-02-22 20:03:35 Your hugs are GOLD! Everytime I watch how you (Teeddy bear) hug Camryn on YR it puts a smile on my face ...It just looks so cute and genuine! You're a great hugger!

6054 2018-02-22 20:03:22 I was sincerely hoping that FEH anna wouldn't be a money grubbing gold digger type. And at first, she wasn't, and then the paralogue maps started existing and I was like "They wasted a perfectly good character. She had potential for depth. God damn it."
6055 2018-02-22 20:03:20 @nikkibenz did you watch the Canada vs USA gold medal game yesterday ? 
6056 2018-02-22 20:03:19 Now I just need to get more gold summoning tickets in the lottery for the event.. still need 10 to hit the 25 goal.... already reached the goal for 50 BS tickets and 1,000 premium... so just waiting for the gold ones before I go all in for getting new 5*
6057 2018-02-22 20:03:19 hey @nbcolympics how about putting the Men's Gold Medal #curling match on NBC (the big boy network)?  @TeamShuster deserves it after upset victory in semi-finals.
6058 2018-02-22 20:03:19 Your intentions were gold.
6059 2018-02-22 20:03:14 He did big time
6060 2018-02-22 20:03:14 Sexist against men is gold though. Missed that one but it is the gift that keeps on giving.
6061 2018-02-22 20:03:14 Accept defeat and accept what you get. Both teams were guaranteed the silver medal but only one could take the gold. Accept and move one!
6062 2018-02-22 20:03:13 Congrats to US Womens Hockey team! You all deserve the gold and more media outlets talking about you. Hard fought win that I was glad to see it while working. Thank you for representing this country so well.

6075 2018-02-22 20:02:36 I have just finished the Welsh tree on Duolingo and am rather smugly admiring all those little gold icons before any of them have the temerity to change back to coloured. Theoretically I can now speak Welsh. Theoretically, purely theoretically 
6076 2018-02-22 20:02:35 The transition will be traumatic. Buy gold and silver as insurance. 
6077 2018-02-22 20:02:34 Classic,  Brings up banks as his gold standard. Wonder if he'll propose, oh, I don't know, funding for this major undertaking.  Or will teachers be required to buy their own gun and training in addition to buying their own school supplies?

6082 2018-02-22 20:02:20 @PhillyD if possible, can you add @DLoesch and her comments about crying mothers being gold ratings from cpac into your news coverage. Thank you.

6086 2018-02-22 20:02:14 Regardless of who could’ve won, shootouts suck for a gold medal. Just so happens this time we were the victims little salty

6088 2018-02-22 20:02:12 Yes, we absolutely watched the Lamoureux-Davidson shootout goal and the final save by Rooney from the USA WHockey Gold Medal win in Strength and Conditioning Class. It fit in perfectly with our discussion of change of direction vs agility, and perception-action coupling.
6089 2018-02-22 20:02:03 they got it right with Geralt Professional, worst case scenario 11 points, which is not that awful but also pretty underwhelming. This card is now either the worst gold in the game or a bad counter.

6122 2018-02-22 20:01:17 I don't blame her because on that level silver is second not 1st & Canada has been winning the Gold so she feels she let her country down & it's deep rooted hockey tradition

6142 2018-02-22 20:00:36 @MikeCarlton01 You are right about Gleeson winning the Gold Kenny for the week but the runner-up has to be Gorgeous George Christensen denouncing mild-mannered @RichardDiNatale as an “extremist”.
6143 2018-02-22 20:00:36 Wow! @emmerdale you really struck gold with Danny and Ryan! Their partnership makes #robron who they are - and that is sublime 
6144 2018-02-22 20:00:35 What is kind of interesting is that both American fans and Canadian fans think that the refs were against them in last night’s gold medal game. Continued validation for a point I make all the time: We are in the midst (at least sports-wise) of the “never-my-fault” generation.

6187 2018-02-22 19:58:29 then go watch the US women's hockey team win the gold from last nite! F###, that was awesome&couldn't sleep till morning
6188 2018-02-22 19:58:26 Feel So Real is a solid-gold classic and 'll fight anyone who disagrees #totp
6189 2018-02-22 19:58:26 I'm getting myself a gold ring on my next birthday
6190 2018-02-22 19:58:23 You’re complaining about the students walking out of school for the #NeverAgain protest, but pull your kids out of school to get haircuts and go shopping. 
6191 2018-02-22 19:58:19 And those poor : that was desperate way to lose the gold medal
6192 2018-02-22 19:58:16 After it is disinfected, and all the bedroom furniture is thrown out, and after that god-awful gold wallpaper is torn off walls in Oval Office....
6193 2018-02-22 19:58:09 What a match. USA wins gold #womenshockey
6194 2018-02-22 19:58:08 Another day...another gold for gdaughter in ballet studies @BdnFestivalArts

6195 2018-02-22 19:58:06 @DLoesch -- “I’m not saying you love the tragedy, but you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold.” -- I don't think I have ever agreed with anything you have said, but this is the triple truth, which you dropped like a prophet would.
6196 2018-02-22 19:58:05 "Paved in Gold." Tomorrow at midnight Eastern time.
6197 2018-02-22 19:57:57 THE  PARABLES  OF  THE  TALENTS  OF  GOLD
6198 2018-02-22 19:57:56 @Nick422 my dude, you tweeted a while back about a black and gold beanie that you bought that was super soft - do you have a link to it?
6199 2018-02-22 19:57:55 I’m American and proud of it but I have ZERO issues with her doing that. She set out with a goal to win gold and wasn’t satisfied with the outcome. Better than the entitled society that thinks everyone wins everything because they signed up
6200 2018-02-22 19:57:54 @XboxSupport i got gold 12 months from prepaid card but today it saying i need to join gold to play online i was able to use netlfix buy things and access my digital game. but i ended up buying gold with card and now i am able to play online what to do
6201 2018-02-22 19:57:46 Dear MS Brewer, I thank you for signing the bill that gave me health care. I am low income and could not afford health care without it. You have saved my health. Thank you, Abraham C. Gold Tucson, AZ
6202 2018-02-22 19:57:41 Congratulations to USA Womens Hockey team for getting gold medal first time since 98.

6207 2018-02-22 19:57:35 I am the freckle fiesta and this gal needs the gold!
6208 2018-02-22 19:57:33 ATTI: #MLBG To Towers Bus 294 running the Blue & Gold is at the Grant & 1st bus stop: 2/22/2018 2:57:27 PM. Next stop: Beechurst@1st.
6209 2018-02-22 19:57:27 Ontem na Arena, entrei pelo portão A (gold e camarotes). Duas belas meninas com chapéu de mosqueteiro faziam a recepção ou promoção de alguma coisa relacionada ao Gremio. Obviamente alguns homens iam tirar fotos com elas, eu e minha esposa observamos a reação delas pós-foto.
6210 2018-02-22 19:57:24 When my agent calls me from Canada very soon I fully intend to answer "Hello, this is America, home of the gold medal hockey team, may I help you?"
In other news, I might be without an agent soon...
6211 2018-02-22 19:57:23 I think Americans don't get that she has to go home to a country that expected them to win gold. Not hoped. Expected. Not all Canadians are nice and they can be especially mean about hockey. Google 'vancouver riot' if you want to understand how crazy we can get over hockey.
6212 2018-02-22 19:57:14 Game is over!  #SWE beats #SUI 11-2 men's #Curling and moves on to play #USA in the #Gold medal match.
6213 2018-02-22 19:57:09 Gold
6214 2018-02-22 19:57:09 Not if they love their main ting
6215 2018-02-22 19:57:06 As bad as the USA men’s curling team played at times we are actually playing in the Gold Medal match. 
6216 2018-02-22 19:57:01 If you start #USAvsCAN hockey gold medal game at the exact same time as you start the #USAvsCAN curling semifinal, you can hear the sound of freedom ringing.  #Olympics
6217 2018-02-22 19:57:00 @psalkovskis important to to remember the gold standard treatment for ocd is Cbt #ocdwoa @maternalocd @ocdaction
6218 2018-02-22 19:56:59 I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was living it up. Like, yo it is, ain't it?
6219 2018-02-22 19:56:59 А ДАВАЙТЕ ВЫ ВСЕ НАПИШЕТЕ СВОИ ОКОННО-ШКОЛЬНЫЕ ИСТОРИИ
6220 2018-02-22 19:56:59 My soul is pure it’s made of gold
6221 2018-02-22 19:56:54 What’s does that even mean lol
6222 2018-02-22 19:56:49 no way in hell she got anyone real gold anything even if it’s plated lmaooooo #dumbwhoreprobs #fakeyeezyszn
6223 2018-02-22 19:56:47 Of course this is all dependent on how Zag and the others skate but Med being the last to skate gives her that option to see how the cards are falling. If a clean skate just guarantees silver then why not go outside the box to maximize points and GO for that gold?
6224 2018-02-22 19:56:43 My Nigga Got A Gold Mind You Niggas Got A Broke Mind 
6225 2018-02-22 19:56:37 CONGRATULATIONS GOLD
6226 2018-02-22 19:56:36 Tie each get gold or determined by total goals in Tournaments shootout rediculous
6227 2018-02-22 19:56:35 Leo Tamola DT de V.Modelo nos habló sobre el desafío de la Copa Haken Gold: " ver si estamos a la altura para dar pelea y ponernos a punto para pelear el ascenso" @DasHandball @HakenGold
6228 2018-02-22 19:56:33 Do people with gold passes get her autograph included too?
6229 2018-02-22 19:56:29 Love @PeoplesMomentum supporting Uni Students protesting for their lecturers gold plated pensions.

Like true far left socialists wherever there is cause to mix it up they will be there, regardless of facts, common sense and oddly their own doctrine.
6230 2018-02-22 19:56:29 Calling people out on there shit is amazing. Give me a medal honestly, I deserve gold.
6231 2018-02-22 19:56:27 I could give less of a shit about the cartoon frog, but usually the people who use the frog on the internet tend to be people exactly like you. So, way to perpetuate a stereotype. Five gold stars   for you!
6232 2018-02-22 19:56:24 @tillersturf, only the best, arena gold on top and arena on the banks.
6233 2018-02-22 19:56:22 With gay religions full of pomp and gold,
6234 2018-02-22 19:56:22 Oh that is gold!
6235 2018-02-22 19:56:16 I just hope we get the gold (i just hope we get the gold)
6236 2018-02-22 19:56:13 I just wonder she will not even give him breathing space.
6237 2018-02-22 19:56:12 When she had a diving save in the first period? Or when she had a stick save to save the game in ot? Or was it the last stop against Canada to win the Gold medal?
6238 2018-02-22 19:56:12 Just watched @TeamUSA women win gold it looked a lot better now than on the middle of the night when I watched it first sudden death is a horrible way to lose
6239 2018-02-22 19:56:11 I cannot get this thing to download, I’m following @Hersheys on twitter and liking them on Facebook and was there for 2 gold medal wins last night, every time I click it makes me watch a video with no coupon
6240 2018-02-22 19:56:08 @Marwah_Hilabi 
6241 2018-02-22 19:56:08 “You can’t have sparkly gold or silver nails” tf 
6242 2018-02-22 19:55:57 That means so much to me... 
the idea of speaking “proper” is becoming a myth. He is respectful and considerate. If his vernacular makes you uncomfortable then you will just miss out on the gold given.
6243 2018-02-22 19:55:57 Oh for sure. His videos are gold.
6244 2018-02-22 19:55:57 can’t believe the US has some of the best female athletes in THE WORLD (hockey Olympic gold 2018, water polo Olympic gold 2016, women’s World Cup winners 2015) and we still can’t be bothered to fund Womens sports in an adequate way or compensate athletes fairly 
6245 2018-02-22 19:55:56 #Hungary’s first gold medalists at a winter #Olympics: Liu Shaoang, Liu Shaolin Sándor, Burján Csaba, Knoch Viktor. 2 of them are half Chinese. Remember what PM #Orban said? “Ethnic homogeneity must be preserved" because "too much mixing is a problem".
6246 2018-02-22 19:55:55 fsck gold history notmuch groups ; which date number limit
6247 2018-02-22 19:55:54 agree, plus i gotta get that gold crown on my ps2 data org file OpieOP
6248 2018-02-22 19:55:53 No usa is best they have GOLD medal to prove it
6249 2018-02-22 19:55:43 @RepTurzai I remember how proud you were of the Red Map you drew in 2011 that was going to propel Romney to victory over Obama. Now you claim that map is the gold standard of #FairMaps!hypocrisy! #DefendDemocracy
6250 2018-02-22 19:55:42 Congratulations to the USA Women’s Ice Hockey Team for defeating Canada and winning the Gold Medal last night. So inspiring. @usahockey 
6251 2018-02-22 19:55:40 If you buy “gold jewelry” with the Virgin Mary, crosses, or a name on it from any ig boutique you a cluck and I can’t respect you lol
6252 2018-02-22 19:55:35 Stop giving bad advice
6253 2018-02-22 19:55:34 I wanted a USA gold medalist to kneel during the anthem so bad, just to see the reaction. One day left...
6254 2018-02-22 19:55:34 Not sure about that! Owners decided against the Gold Cup after Jan race. NTD hopes the horse will get there next year
6255 2018-02-22 19:55:33 At least it's not gold thread.
6256 2018-02-22 19:55:24 I was taken aback when I heard Dana Loesch say that crying white mothers are ratings gold, but... she was on the money when she said there are crickets when black mothers are crying over the violent loss of their children.  She's right though.  #ThursdayThoughts
6257 2018-02-22 19:55:23 I had just been on YouTube watching the US girls singing our anthem with Olympic Gold accessories! Plus I love it when Wray says....However...however....
6258 2018-02-22 19:55:19 Within a 3 wk period @mackhollins won a SB and @skrooops28 won a gold medal. They attended Wootton HS at the same time. School not known for athletics.  Amazing
6259 2018-02-22 19:55:19 Three boys now discharged from hospital following the mass drug overdose at a Gold Coast school on Wednesday, four remain hospitalised but continue to “steadily improve” health officials say @7NewsBrisbane @sunriseon7
6260 2018-02-22 19:55:18 What are you doing 1:30 am EST this Saturday? I am watching @TeamShuster go for curling gold.
6261 2018-02-22 19:55:07 Simple. Kill the guy with the gold scar BAM you got a gold scar.
6262 2018-02-22 19:55:06 As for Wakanda 
6263 2018-02-22 19:55:06 All right, I like it. It's big, it's gold, it's fancy. Fancy pants. <zaphod>
6264 2018-02-22 19:55:06 All these icons, reading from lyric sheets and stealing the Band Aid idea. Michael Jackson is grotesquely over dressed in gold - it's a charity record, you gazillionaire! #TOTP
6265 2018-02-22 19:55:04 Congrats to the all the medalists, but in particular the US Women's Hockey team.  That was an epic gold medal final.
6266 2018-02-22 19:55:04 Só as que ganharam o sorteio de 2 hambúrgueres e 4 chopes no Gold Burger, deus eh top
6267 2018-02-22 19:55:03 I haven’t watched it , but an out Canadian gay guy was the first to get gold in the pairing. No hype about him. Adams hype was all about his issues with the VP of The USA.
6268 2018-02-22 19:55:01 Gold member zijn, dan mag je zo op een eerdere ... maar ja, al meer dan vaak vertraging gehad.

Ook nog: Thalys is apart bedrijf ;)
6269 2018-02-22 19:54:59 gold. gold Jerry
6270 2018-02-22 19:54:57 Barrick Gold the world's largest producer of bullion, has yet to deliver on the "conundrum" of growth, but it will not make an acquisition simply to bulk up, Chairman John Thornton said an investor update on Thursday
6271 2018-02-22 19:54:56 @XboxSupport why do you make it so difficult to cancel Xbox gold?? I don't want to pay for it anymore
6272 2018-02-22 19:54:54 All three American Olympic athletes who trash-talked the leaders of their country are coming home empty-handed.  Only gold they got is in their teeth. #notmyolympian
6273 2018-02-22 19:54:54 Was watching men's speed skating earlier and quite enjoyed watching Hungary win gold , until I saw her rush up ( with her 'dodgy' leg and jump over one of the guys) . Didn't realise her bf was a Hungarian skater.  They even banged on about how it would make her feel better ffs.
6274 2018-02-22 19:54:51 a trainer in pokémon gold approached me and said “pokemon can’t do anything when they’re asleep. i’ll show you how scary that is.” and that’s the most threatening thing that’s ever been said to me
6275 2018-02-22 19:54:47 That red white and gold saree <3 *dying here*
6276 2018-02-22 19:54:46 Damn, after seeing my name in a bunch of these top 10's makes me really wanna play right now. Thanks everyone and Good Luck to all playing tonight.

Personally hoping for some south safezones and a gold ar :)
6277 2018-02-22 19:54:45 AHHHHHHHHHH   thorin with gold sickness was always so intense towards bilbo!!!!
6278 2018-02-22 19:54:44 IF Zag repeats her LP from Euros the gold is hers. If I were Med I would go for the 3S-3T-3T. Yes it does not give her more points but it adds a wow factor that can give a PCS bump.Might as well for for broke for that gold bc even a failed attempt would still get her silver...
6279 2018-02-22 19:54:43 These braces needa hurry up I'm trynna cop some gold fangs!
6280 2018-02-22 19:54:41 When is the gold medal match?
6281 2018-02-22 19:54:41 Stop sensationalizing this. She didn’t “yank” it off as some stories make it seem. She didn’t toss it aside. She simply removed it from her neck and held it. Her goal wasn’t the silver it was the gold. Obvious disappointment, especially in this moment, is hard to hide.
6282 2018-02-22 19:54:34 FYI... This is not the country's first Gold in the games.... The US won 8 Golds so far.... #Peongchang2018 #WinterOlympics
6283 2018-02-22 19:54:31 Lolllll oooo lord
6284 2018-02-22 19:54:27 やぁ！
6285 2018-02-22 19:54:25 @BeRadKnotts @VUCE_almighty @TMoneyPrice97 1. Been fans of the podcast since day one. 2. We bleed blue and gold just like ole @PatMcAfeeShow . 3. No one loves brews and baseball more than us!
6286 2018-02-22 19:54:16 Ow yeah attack attack  old but gold , crabcore style hhahaa 
6287 2018-02-22 19:54:12 I hate being part of the hate mob here but... this card is just absolute trash now. Come on guys it shouldn't be that hard to design a gold like this.
6288 2018-02-22 19:54:12 Only @espn can take the women’s gold medal shootout GWG & make it about football highlights instead of...ya know...hockey news flash it is still a sport
6289 2018-02-22 19:54:09 “I wanna buy a USA women’s hockey jersey, they won gold yesterday..it’s all about gender equality, man..” @TJ_Stambek
6290 2018-02-22 19:54:06 @JocelyneUSA17 Congratulations to you and your team mates on winning the GOLD. Yet another French/Canadian extract gets the win.
6291 2018-02-22 19:54:05 So they the gold what about 2nd through 35th?
6292 2018-02-22 19:54:00 E ta ruim ?
6293 2018-02-22 19:54:00 USA W Hockey...Great job bringing home the Gold Ladies!!!!
6294 2018-02-22 19:54:00 @TeamCanada The team definitely deserved gold, however shootouts aren't for Canadians, because Canadians play REAL hockey. Without Canada, nobody could play hockey.
6295 2018-02-22 19:53:59 Mikael Kingsbury winning gold in the moguls. Three golds in the for Canada in the sport.
6296 2018-02-22 19:53:58 nah, USA earned the gold baby!
6297 2018-02-22 19:53:58  Justin Edinburgh would Have been #FPL gold 
6298 2018-02-22 19:53:57 Indeed it would be impossible 2 repay by very nature of debt-based money & fractional-reserve banking. 

Hence only 2 possible ways of resolving, which contrary 2 popular opinion are not really mutually-exclusive. 

Buy gold. 
6299 2018-02-22 19:53:56 Wow that’s quite a stretch comparison! Simple no. 

Russia cheated to win medals period, the Canadian women’s hockey team has flat out dominated the scene and anything but Gold is a letdown. I get it too, just think u keep the medal on in that situation personally.
6300 2018-02-22 19:53:56 Gold.
6301 2018-02-22 19:53:53 Congrats to the better team on winning gold! 
6302 2018-02-22 19:53:51 .......it might shine like it.. ..but might not be gold....  Careful what u wish for cos u just might get it.. Lol.. One chance.
6303 2018-02-22 19:53:47 Wow.  I may have to pull out my cheapie long pearl strands today.  This looks awesome.  I'm still in love with gold eyeshadow, too.
6304 2018-02-22 19:53:45 Kings & Queens, of princes & princesses,  pass down gold. 

What’s it going to be  for your prince  or princess ? 

6305 2018-02-22 19:53:43 Это определенно какой-то знак
6306 2018-02-22 19:53:42 my gold boothang necklace is silver in some spots..
6307 2018-02-22 19:53:40 Watching Olympians get their gold medals makes me cry I'm just so happy for them
6308 2018-02-22 19:53:39 Congratulations ladies, you did yourselves proud, you made your nation proud.   Don't forget to update your social media profiles! Olympic Gold medalist #USA @mduggan10 @meganebozek @JocelyneUSA17 @usahockey

6311 2018-02-22 19:53:33 Yes, I will be up at 2:30am Saturday to watch the men's Gold Medal Round of Curling USA VS See unless I fall asleep.
6312 2018-02-22 19:53:26 A come from behind victory and she wins the gold! Oppression Olympics history was made here today!

6314 2018-02-22 19:53:22 If we don’t get a Whitney or Titantic edit from last nights #TeamUSA gold medal shootout win, then why do we even have social media..... @jlhoban
6315 2018-02-22 19:53:21 Maricel de Escobar nos contó porque quieren jugar la Copa Haken Gold por 2° vez: "nos da la posibilidad de jugar con equipos de otro nivel y nos gustan los desafíos"  @ceciliawendel @HakenGold @DasHandball
6316 2018-02-22 19:53:20 ホモォってカッコよくね？
6317 2018-02-22 19:53:19 2 years of fut champions, always gold 2/ gold 1 player, NEVER rewarded with a player worth more than 70k. Thanks @EAFIFABR @EASPORTSFIFA #fifa18 #FUT #FUTChampions #FutChamps #FixFIFA
6318 2018-02-22 19:53:17 @dwancherry  Have you combined the Kessel ‘s Stanley Cup and gold metal yet?
6319 2018-02-22 19:53:15 If you get a R4i gold card you can install customer firmware
6320 2018-02-22 19:53:13 The #NRA loves mass shootings because those incidents ramp up fear which sells even more guns. Mass shootings are gun sales gold to the NRA. #StopNRAmazon #NRABloodMoney
6321 2018-02-22 19:53:13 Yup! The ladies brought it!!! #usawomenshockey #Gold          I think they took my advice & watched Miracle before the game & Kurt Russell probably called.
6322 2018-02-22 19:53:11 What if I paid to have my car painted gold 
6323 2018-02-22 19:53:10 I'm telling y'all, everyone should be following @metroadlib on here. She is Twitter Gold!
6324 2018-02-22 19:53:10 @KatiMorton So sorry for Canada’s unsportsmanlike behaviour. Ew. How embarrassing. Im sure it was a good and fair game- I had to go to bed at 1:30am when they were still playing and I was so sick of Canadian penalties getting called! Congrats on the gold USA!
6325 2018-02-22 19:53:10 And gold ! Man! I think everyone should buy these till Amazon figures out how dumb they are.. A GOLD BITCOIN.. For only $5.. Whoa..
6326 2018-02-22 19:53:10 The hashtags for commodities such as #gold #silver during these #Olympics are working out great for our news stories! Maybe we can convince @Twitter to keep them. #TheProspectorNews #mining #investments #Commodities
6327 2018-02-22 19:53:10 I remember laughing at Homer’s conviction he could find “Lincoln’s gold”
6328 2018-02-22 19:53:04 Is Idiocy a new Olympic event? Cuz the USA just brought home the gold.
6329 2018-02-22 19:53:01 @HC_Women Outstanding effort in the Gold Medal game. You truly left it all on the rink. I know it must hurt today but be very proud. All of Canada is with you.
6330 2018-02-22 19:53:00 A smash and grab where the theives drive a Ford Fiesta when there's a Ferrari in the garage and then when they get to the bank they grab the free pens and bags of copper instead of the gold bullion.
6331 2018-02-22 19:52:59 Diana are you calling the other athletes that competed and didn’t win gold losers?  That seems a little in American doesn’t it.  You do know we had military personnel competeing that did not win.
6332 2018-02-22 19:52:58 Look good on me like rose gold
6333 2018-02-22 19:52:55 It's soooooo good, it's literally a pub quiz gold mine! Speaking of which:

Did you also know it took 590,712 blocks weighing 6 million tonnes to build The Great Pyramid of Giza?... Which is not to be confused with The Great Pyramid of Geezer, that's a South London Cockney Pub 
6334 2018-02-22 19:52:53 And it's not like I'm sitting on a pile of gold and money is nothing to me

6337 2018-02-22 19:52:40 Because "white mothers crying are ratings gold".. All the people at #CPAC2018 disgust me...
6338 2018-02-22 19:52:38  I just can't stop laughing
6339 2018-02-22 19:52:36 You make a valid point, but would you store wealth in fiat or gold?
6340 2018-02-22 19:52:35 Perhaps the News might consider paying some attention to Nichols hockey now? I don't see any FLOP alumnae wearing Olympic gold.
6341 2018-02-22 19:52:35 In Gold Coast tho ? Not Sydney, right ?

6344 2018-02-22 19:52:31 It’s our gold medal beauty enjoy it
6345 2018-02-22 19:52:30 I’m not as into the Winter Olympics but USA Women’s Hockey was awesome last night!!! First gold in 20 yrs!
6346 2018-02-22 19:52:29 Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
6347 2018-02-22 19:52:29 There’s a spectrum of excellence so I favour colours. But gold, silver and bronze is too coarse. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. Only zealots pretend we need seven colours in our spectrum.
6348 2018-02-22 19:52:28 מה הקטע בבייק אוף לקבל לתוכנית מתחרים שהם קונדיטורים מקצועיים לצד חובבנים? במקור האנגלי התוכנית מיועדת לאופים שזהו התחביב שלהם ולא המקצוע העיקרי, עקרות בית וכו.
6349 2018-02-22 19:52:27 LMAO THIS IS GOLD
6350 2018-02-22 19:52:26 @TeamCanada To the female hockey players who played for the gold last night, wear your silver medal with pride and honor.

6357 2018-02-22 19:52:03 Dear God, they won the Gold but you guys want the cake and eat it too. Of course they deserve the Gold with two perfect programs. It doesn't mean the French artistic delivery of their Free Dance wasn't closer to art than competitive sport.

6375 2018-02-22 19:50:56 All those who were not even in the medals would not care silver or Gold.  Some countries have never won a medal right?
6376 2018-02-22 19:50:54 @EASPORTS_MUT hello mut team I am writing to ask can at any point this year we get some sets that you have to collect individual cards(silver gold elite) I spend over 5k a year buying points only to have waste several cards due to you guys being lazy and not making sets extensive
6377 2018-02-22 19:50:53 I fully agree. I remember when the game was a battle for vision and buying wards was huge skill cap and placement in correct spots. Spending gold for vision and supports were seen as gods able to use sighstones early on.

I took a lot of gold nuggets from it! #WeAreMVP #CrushingIt
6382 2018-02-22 19:50:44 okay I could not stop staring at @Lupita_Nyongo 's SKIN IN BLACK PANTHER!!! I know that ain't just shea butter...what is it sis? grapeseed oil? almond oil? do you exfoliate with flakes of gold??? The people need to know.
6383 2018-02-22 19:50:41 The gems you get from the guild, save those. You can convert those to gold at a later point if need be. It’s what I’m doing right now myself.
6384 2018-02-22 19:50:39 Turned my sorrow into treasured gold..
6385 2018-02-22 19:50:37 Congrats #TeamUSA Also, I do not fault Jocelyne Larocque from team CA for taking off her silver.  You do not win the silver in Olympic Ice Hockey...it is given to you for losing to the gold medal team.  It was an emotional loss for her and the team.  Hats off to all of them.
6386 2018-02-22 19:50:36 The team gold is amazing, fantastic.  So proud of our athletes.
6387 2018-02-22 19:50:34 Canadian Women's #Olympics Hockey vs. U.S.A. may have ended up with a silver medal final score, but showed us a world-class gold medal effort. Well done ladies! #CANvsUSA #TeamCanada

6391 2018-02-22 19:50:31 The curling loss is a deep burn, no doubt, but all can be made well with a win in the “Canadian Super Bowl”— the men’s hockey gold medal game. The 1 day every 4 yrs my wife is a hockey fan!
6392 2018-02-22 19:50:30 #JocelyneLarocque #USAvsCAN #womenshockey  it’s not gold but it’s silver be thankful of opportunities given not all get them. But that was really not what the #Olympics is all about. Poor judgement and embarrassed yourself.
6393 2018-02-22 19:50:28 I’m disappointed and sad that @TeamCanada and women’s @HockeyCanada lost against the @usahockey in the gold medal  game. We will come back in 2022 to win the  in the Beijing Winter Olympics. #TeamCanada #EquipeCanada #Beijing2022
6394 2018-02-22 19:50:28 A day later. Still can't fathom Canada Women's coach rolling 8 skaters in a 20 minute overtime. Poor, poor coaching. Now I'm not saying it cost them the gold, buuuut...... It's definitely one of the reasons they have a silver medal.
6395 2018-02-22 19:50:26 Its proven beyond reasonable doubt that there is no gold minable by asms . the same commissioner omunyoro baguma who told the president to send us there has said there is no gold and is looking for a forest reserve to send us

6437 2018-02-22 19:48:37 3 days left. I like watching winter sports n Norwegian athletes winning medals doesn't make it less enjoyable.  But I'm sick of the "why is that medal 'only' a bronze/silver and not a gold" coverage that's all over media in Norway these days. Any Olympic medal is a win IMO.
6438 2018-02-22 19:48:32 I love watching hockey teams win gold medals at 1am, but there is absolutely nothing better than just sitting here silent, watching Animal Planet with my little buddy on a Thursday afternoon. 
6439 2018-02-22 19:48:31 Definitely would have watched the entire gold medal game if I didn’t have the morning show. Congratulations to everyone on the team!

I would rather a media outlet have huge ratings for the Women's USA Hockey team winning the Gold Medal than have it about a mass shooting at a school. #NeverAgain

6451 2018-02-22 19:47:59 Some of us are, but I didn’t even know the gold medal game was last night. I haven’t been following ANYTHING. Yay, apathy.
6452 2018-02-22 19:47:59 Oh man. Worst news all day. Bring this back. It was comedic gold, especially with @DougBenson. Moments with him were hilarious. Where's the petition to sign....dammit man let the people's anger be the force to make this a thing...again!
6453 2018-02-22 19:47:58 @SineadOCarroll not sure if your fandom of Scott has cooled off after the skating, but his fandom at the women's gold medal hockey game last night is elevating him to national treasure.

6480 2018-02-22 19:46:42 Why can’t we normalize avant-garde fashion. Like I want to wear a fucking gold plated headdress with an extremely oversized kimono and metallic 9 inch heels.
6481 2018-02-22 19:46:40 Ever heard @MickstapeShow do an ad read. Pure gold
6482 2018-02-22 19:46:38 that's cute. my cost of gas way lower then that, while my riders are quite high.  what do they deliver the gas in, gold plated trucks?
6483 2018-02-22 19:46:36 The fact that you thought that far ahead is GOLD. Literal GOLD.
6484 2018-02-22 19:46:36 I’m nobody judge but she is so 
6485 2018-02-22 19:46:33 Truly displaying poor sportsmanlike conduct,sad.
It was a fantastic game and the team should be proud of their past gold medal performances and last night’s silver medal.
6486 2018-02-22 19:46:32 At the 2020 summer games, if the gold medal game in basketball isn't decided in OT, does it go to a free throw competition?

Will baseball use a home run derby after ten innings?

Championships in team sports should not be determined by an individual competition.
6487 2018-02-22 19:46:28 Apparently I bought two of their dragon hatchlings (I didn't realize both were theirs lol) and since the person saw I was new they wanted to repay me for spending so much gold on dragons haha

6503 2018-02-22 19:45:43 People are hammering Jocelyne Larocque for taking her silver medal off as soon as it hit her neck... I'm not mad at her for it... They don't play for silver... And for most of those women that's like losing the Stanley Cup cause gold is the pinnacle for them...

6509 2018-02-22 19:45:29 Nah. It just means you turn lead into gold.
6510 2018-02-22 19:45:24 She was on the team that won gold 4 years ago. She’s just a sore loser. I don’t blame them for being pissed, but it’s just disrespectful for the athletes that didn’t medal

6512 2018-02-22 19:45:15 I'm fine with the bullseye, just wish it were a bit smaller. The Youtube TV icon has way too much going on and the red totally clashes with the black and gold. All white or all gold would work, IMO!
6513 2018-02-22 19:45:11 @MeghanMcCain @NRA's Dana Loesch attacked the news media just hours after appearing in a CNN town hall...telling the audience at CPAC “many in legacy media love mass shootings” becuz “crying white mothers are ratings gold.” Maybe you should have a chat with your "dear" friend.
6514 2018-02-22 19:45:06 @WargamingEUCS  - 200 golds just disappear from my account. I did not purchase any equipment whatsoever. I had 240, suddenly I noticed it was only 40. There was no confirmation for spending any golds either. This is like stealing money. What happened to my gold. Write soon.

6528 2018-02-22 19:44:31 No wonder DBZ spawned so many reaction images this show is a gold mine.
6529 2018-02-22 19:44:20 Patrick Chan tripped and failed his trick but still got gold because his jumps were high and amazing. 
6530 2018-02-22 19:44:11 @BesideCraig @martybiron43 That Beyond Blue and Gold was the best ever. If they want to remind Buffalo how great the Sabres once were, about the pride we had in our team, they would play this in the arena at the next home game. Thanks for the memories guys.
6531 2018-02-22 19:44:11 You just know that when they were rehearsing this they were like "This is gold! People will love it."

6553 2018-02-22 19:43:42 Both teams deserve congratulations. Only a lucky bounce gave them the gold. You might at least congratulate Canadians as well. Oh wait you don’t know how to say a job well done except when it applies to you. I see your men’s hockey are done. We are not. Lol
6554 2018-02-22 19:43:38 So Far so good

6608 2018-02-22 19:41:47 The US Women's Hockey Team went from going on stike for equal pay to winning a gold medal in less than a year. In the words of Cammi Granato, "When a woman wins, victory is passed around like cake."
6609 2018-02-22 19:41:46 Tg
6610 2018-02-22 19:41:42 So RIDICULOUS- Czech won men's gold in s shootout with Hasek .....it NO WAY to decide a game of than significance imo
6611 2018-02-22 19:41:34 Girl this is PURE GOLD!! 
6612 2018-02-22 19:41:30 With everything going on I totally missed the US Women's hockey team winning the gold against Canada. If you have a chance check out the penalty-shot clip. It was epic.
6613 2018-02-22 19:41:29 I bought a set of Khaled Hosseini books for a potential chill read while sipping coffee but these books just won't let me rest. They're good but I can't actually say I enjoy the process of reading? I just experience a devastatingly tragic life separate from my own. Sad but gold.
6614 2018-02-22 19:41:29 oh man, Canada loses the gold in Hockey to the US last night and now loses the semi-final in Curling also to the US today...what's happening?
6615 2018-02-22 19:41:27 Если честно, хочу попасть в некоторые места но я боюсь заебать человека, потому что я уже его заебал ;)
Поэтому утром я поеду в одно из этих мест, а между первым и вторым перерывчик аж до мая.
6616 2018-02-22 19:41:26 Don’t get me wrong, I am so thrilled the USA Women’s Ice Hockey team won the gold, but medal-deciding games should never be decided by a shoot out.
6617 2018-02-22 19:41:21 People complain about too many swimming medals. At least they are in all kinds of different stuff, how many freakin speed skating gold medals do they award? 20? #Olympics
6618 2018-02-22 19:41:21 I smell GOLD. Lets do this boys. Time to kick the shit outta some Swedes!
6619 2018-02-22 19:41:16 A baseball player could hit 100 HR, hit .450,  drive in 250 play Gold Glove defense and still play for a 100 loss team. So much more of an individual game.
6620 2018-02-22 19:41:14 Thanks. Don't see alot of skarner in my elo (gold 2), I'm hoping to shake things up a bit
6621 2018-02-22 19:41:13 How does the gold medal win overshadow the tour win?
6622 2018-02-22 19:41:12 Wow USA women’s hockey  wins gold!!! #Olympics2018 #OlympicHockey #womenstrong

6626 2018-02-22 19:41:10 Bronze and silver? It doesnt matter I believe, perhaps even in gold. Im sure if you CS well and play the objective game that'll let you climb consistently

6631 2018-02-22 19:40:46 With Curling gold at 2am cst, I need to either go to bed early and wake up at 2am, or not go to work tomorrow. I prefer the second option. #sacrifice4gold

6634 2018-02-22 19:40:43 At the 2020 summer games, if the gold medal game in basketball isn't decided in OT, does it go to a free throw competition?

Will baseball use a home run derby after ten innings?

Championships in team sports should not be determined by an individual competition.

6646 2018-02-22 19:40:23 Would have loved to watch this game, but unfortunately work comes first. If I was smart I would’ve taped this game on my DVR. But congratulations to the US women’s hockey team on winning the GOLD!!!!!!!!!!
6647 2018-02-22 19:40:18 Poor 'Howard'.....bought & sold for English gold!
6648 2018-02-22 19:40:18 New rules enacted after the completion of the Sochi Olympics allow for sung music in figure skating and ice dancing routines.  A welcomed change.  French Skaters skated to "Sounds of Silence" by Disturbed.  The Canadian duo took Gold skating to The Stones, Eagles & Santana.

6657 2018-02-22 19:40:04 "Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you and many of the legacy media in the back," NRA spokesperson @DLoesch to CPAC.  These people are disgusting. They will say anything to appeal to their base.

6666 2018-02-22 19:39:44 Meghan's good friend Dana Loesch says, "I'll say this slowly so the media can hear it:  Many in legacy media love. Mass. Shootings. You guys love it. You love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold."  These people are truly disgusting & have no place in the media.
6667 2018-02-22 19:39:43 I’m not saying they aren’t I have all the respect and admiration in the world for those women they did what few other people in the world can claim they won gold in the Olympics but he will turn on them and I for one will side with the women if he does
6668 2018-02-22 19:39:42 The medal 

The Gold medal is awarded to the team with the highest score! What makes anyone think her team should have the Gold? Grow up!
6669 2018-02-22 19:39:41 GOLD MEDAL FOR YOU
NOOOO... I WAS UNDA WAH-UHHH
6670 2018-02-22 19:39:40 You see the cross-country skiing relay? USA's first ever gold! Best call of the @NBCOlympics.
6671 2018-02-22 19:39:35 I lost sleep and am tired, but saw amazing athletes on both sides. True to the American spirit, #USAHockey rose to the occasion, came from behind, and proved themselves the better team. Amazing game. Amazing team! USA’s gold medalists. #USAvsCAN

6678 2018-02-22 19:39:16 Maybe most people don’t like consolation prizes or a pat in the back for showing up. The goal is to win & gold signifies that.
6679 2018-02-22 19:39:11 Bi niggas are important to the growth of our society. They are healthy. Their dick is gold. We don't deserve such legendary allies.

6694 2018-02-22 19:38:26 Agree with the tweet saying play 5 on 5 till someone scores. 3 on 3 is just as weak as a shootout to decide the gold medal winner.
6695 2018-02-22 19:38:21 Gold coins would solve ALL problems
6696 2018-02-22 19:38:21 Not that going gold isn’t bad but now going gold is HUGE. Back then, going gold was definitely looked as not an L.

6701 2018-02-22 19:38:09 Not enough people are talking about USA women’s hockey winning gold. No matter who wins gold in men’s it’ll come with an asterisk cause everyone knows the best players are playing meaningless nhl games, women’s tho they are the best in the world bar none. #USA #usawomenshockey
6702 2018-02-22 19:38:08 The pack luck on @EASPORTSFIFA is nearly as bad as the game play.... gold 2 and not 1 board pull

6704 2018-02-22 19:37:56 So are you calling everyone of our athletes that did not get a gold medal losers.  That includes the 240+ athletes that have not made a single political comment as well as military athletes who are participating but didn’t medal?

6713 2018-02-22 19:37:42 Watching Top of the Pops from 1985 on @BBCFOUR - some absolute gold, closely followed by some utter 80s-stereotypical bobbins. Great stuff.

6725 2018-02-22 19:37:01 One of the best hockey games ever,men or women.With so many amazing performances this Oly, incl my secret crush @BobsledKaillie, that tremendous game highlights how absolutely epic our Can women athletes are.And if as good Can’s we have to let US have gold every 20yrs so be it 
6726 2018-02-22 19:36:59 Tonight we at it again!!!!
6727 2018-02-22 19:36:58 Good question. Looks like cryptocurrency is the answer. I guess if it works for oil, why not gold?
6728 2018-02-22 19:36:51 it's the making of the gold, which is often made at the expense of someone elses lack of knowledge is one of the things I struggle with.. 

But it's super rewarding to have the resources to help others when they need it. catch 22.
6729 2018-02-22 19:36:49 Lmao Hilary Knight got PED tested right after winning a gold medal. That’s some kind of athlete beast mode goal.

6737 2018-02-22 19:36:27 So there are 16 year olds out there winning Gold Olympic medals...when I was 16, I could just about complete my GCSEs

6746 2018-02-22 19:36:17 It was wonderful, as a rare WWE babyface turn that didn't fundamentally alter anything about the character. Regal was still a nasty bastard, but with a heart of gold, & I think that's broadly the space he's occupied ever since.
6747 2018-02-22 19:36:17 Until your nation again holds the Gold, you must use the U.S. spelling of words such as honor.
6748 2018-02-22 19:36:17 How about Hungary winning their first gold medal outside of figure skating.  I have a smile when I think of how excited they must have been.  Good for them!
6749 2018-02-22 19:36:13 Are we gonna get a warm up gold bottles tweet after the game, just so you’re ready for the regular season? Stupid question of course your ready.
6750 2018-02-22 19:36:11 I would be fuckin pissed if I just lost the biggest game I will ever have... Maybe the last chance I get at getting gold. I wouldn’t keep that hanging around my neck either
6751 2018-02-22 19:36:11 softer than satin 

Canada was stackin gold in that event for years - of course they're pissed to get silver 

people mad that other people aren't happy enough about losing 

Jesus Christ get a grip
6752 2018-02-22 19:36:10 Gold or bust that's what we expect, that's what they expect. You think USA basketball would be happy with silver??
6753 2018-02-22 19:36:08 @jimrome Unreal ! We ate Fruit Loops the morning be beat Canada for the GOLD!  #FruitLoops #USA #OlympicRings 

- USA Woman's Hockey Team
6754 2018-02-22 19:36:06 Proud to be a Canadian  congratulations to the USA girls gold 
6755 2018-02-22 19:36:02 Second is not failure on a global championship level. That's an ignorant opinion. I guess you're a failure of a writer because you're not the best. Also Canada wasn't the favorite this year in the gold. They were the underdog according to both US and Canadian betting sources.
6756 2018-02-22 19:36:00 You do understand that Trump is a “globalist elite”right? His businesses are funded by foreign banks, he’s building his gold elitists towers that his base can’t afford in other countries, he wouldn’t stay in a Holiday inn if he had to, what’s not globalist and elitist about him?
6757 2018-02-22 19:35:59 So I love Scott but he needs to stop showing up to games where gold is on the line cause he’s 2 for 2
6758 2018-02-22 19:35:59 UGH!!! It’s a Golden Jaguar NOT a Gold Panther!!!
6759 2018-02-22 19:35:54 I got this one and China for free and I don't have a gold account, cant complain at free games.
6760 2018-02-22 19:35:52 does anywhere know of a place (preferably in town) that could repair a thin gold chain? i cut mine in half with my razor by accident lol x
6761 2018-02-22 19:35:47 Creo que ya lo he dicho pero la voz solista de Niall en Fool's Gold me mata. Vale. Me. Ma. Ta.
6762 2018-02-22 19:35:46 I seriously cry every time I watch America win a gold
6763 2018-02-22 19:35:45 Pots of Gold is now on BLOWOUT SPECIAL! Come get a gram of this great Indica Hybrid for $7 or get an ounce for only $120! *All After Tax!
6764 2018-02-22 19:35:45 I will point something very important out,do you realize that all land originally inhabited by colored people are the pieces of land blessed with gold,silver,gems etc. and that by means of violence and manipulation those pieces of land were stolen or otherwise occupied,Russia not
6765 2018-02-22 19:35:43 All the data shows that “crying white mothers”is gold for gun sales also.
6766 2018-02-22 19:35:41 But then... Where's my Margarita truck, AND where was it at midnight when I was celebrating the US Women's Hockey Team winning gold?!
6767 2018-02-22 19:35:38 I mean when amanda kessel wins gold and you immediately tweet about ovechkin its kinda ridiculous
6768 2018-02-22 19:35:36 1980:
US Men's Hockey win gold.
Minnesotans on team: 14

2018:
US Men's Hockey lose quarterfinals.
Minnesotans on team: 2
US Women's Hockey team win gold.
Minnesotans on team: 9

Conclusion:
Want to win gold in hockey? Put more Minnesotans on your team.
#USA
6769 2018-02-22 19:35:35 Silver was better than so many girls got for their fight and efforts of 4 years.
But...That U.S. Women's Hockey Gold is SWEEEET
6770 2018-02-22 19:35:35 arthas i don't care if you're dead you still owe me 100000 gold
6771 2018-02-22 19:35:31 @TeamShuster Great job!!! The USA is proud!!! You guys having nothing left to prove, to no one!  Go out and have fun in the Gold Medal game!  We support you!!
6772 2018-02-22 19:35:27 @971theticketxyt lol yeah you beat canada how's your men's team doing Jeff? We have 27 gold medals in world championships 6 golds out of 8 tournament in Canada Cup and 9 golds in the Olympics lol how many you got #itsourgame
6773 2018-02-22 19:35:26 @ManonVandersmi2 haar gesprekken I can’t breathe pure gold comedy 
6774 2018-02-22 19:35:22 Wow, as much as I hate you right now I have to say that was gold!
Now announce support for BTCP please! Sooner then later!

6776 2018-02-22 19:35:20 "Trump loves the military" is my favorite joke. 
He: 
- Can't differentiate between the branches of the Armed Forces
- Never served, jokes about his deferments
-  Forgets/neglects to return salutes rendered to him
- Routinely disrespects Gold Star families
6777 2018-02-22 19:35:17 #CelebsGoDating How rude was Jade to disappear without saying anything. She maybe a gold medalist but she's also very rude
6778 2018-02-22 19:35:17 Like. What the actual fuck are you on about? Unicorns are real and full of magic rainbows. But shergar. He definitely didn't fly despite the Cheltenham gold Cup. Who said horses fly?!

6783 2018-02-22 19:35:08 It takes a pretty disturbed indvidual to say a grieving white woman crying on tv is ratings  gold. I expect that from Kelly AnneConway. Anybody who plays that type of card loses all respect. Dana Loesch disturbed individual and should be investigated for owning firearms

6791 2018-02-22 19:34:48 Rubio deserves a gold medal. Those teenagers need to be taught manners
6792 2018-02-22 19:34:45 Where can we watch it tho!!?? It's ridiculous it might only be available on nbc gold! Any other tv networks? Live streams? This is a major marathon with no tv coverage!
6793 2018-02-22 19:34:45 What, @RajShah45, no mention of Women Ice Hockey #TeamUSA winning Gold at #Olympics during summary before taking questions at @WhiteHouse #PressBriefing? Sad! #MAGA #CNN #TheLead #FoxAndFriends

6799 2018-02-22 19:34:37 @TeamShuster Congratulations  on making it to the gold medal round. I know you will win.....showed my doctors at Cleveland clinic  your tweet....bring home the gold.....USA

なんて欲深い。
でもそうやって明日も生きてくで
6802 2018-02-22 19:34:21 He’s changing more than just the uniforms. He’s changing the culture! Into one where guys are proud to wear the maroon and gold on Saturday’s and Row the Boat to become Elite!!
6803 2018-02-22 19:34:15 Hahaha I thought I was the only one. I'm trying to have some sort of order going on lately but at the end of the day you can have your own unique take on it. Wouldn't it be boring if all pages looked the same?
6804 2018-02-22 19:34:07 ATTI: #MLBG To Towers Bus 294 running the Blue & Gold is at the Grant & 1st bus stop: 2/22/2018 2:34:04 PM. Next stop: Beechurst@1st.
6805 2018-02-22 19:34:06 I’m not disagree that. But we all have seen a game that gets pushed to a shootout. One goalie was dominating but his team can’t make a shot. He lets one through and they lose. I’d hate for that to happen in a championship/gold medal game.
6806 2018-02-22 19:34:04 And they were still really close to ending it on the PP in OT. Another great US-Can gold medal game but one that was there to be had.
6807 2018-02-22 19:34:04 Don't make us Pull up!
6808 2018-02-22 19:34:02 Congratulations to the Women's @usahockey Team on finally winning the #GOLD last night. We're all so proud of you USA!!!! USA!!!! 
6809 2018-02-22 19:34:01 Poll question: Do you have a problem with the Canadian hockey player for taking the silver medal off after it was awarded to her, following their loss in the gold medal game to USA?
6810 2018-02-22 19:34:00 We want... more gold medals.
6811 2018-02-22 19:33:58 I totally get why they’re upset, I see the passion. And yes def better then throwing it lol. But Idk how many other silver medals I’ve seen awarded and they act like they got gold! They are in the public eye now, role models.
6812 2018-02-22 19:33:57 But the gold even
has experience of
6813 2018-02-22 19:33:56 Wish I could give you gold for this comment.  Same thing every video.
6814 2018-02-22 19:33:54 У нас раздевалки в спортзале были немного подвальные, поэтому окно находилось в двух метрах от земли. Но если поставить стульчик, то все заебись, можно подтянуться на руках и вообще огонь.
6815 2018-02-22 19:33:53 I'm so pissed that I didn't stay up last night and finish watching #TeamUSA win Gold in Women's Hockey!! Congrats, Ladies!! #Olympics
6816 2018-02-22 19:33:51 I beg to differ, kids are so spoiled rotten, if they don't get Gold, I spit on the rest of my team and the medal.
6817 2018-02-22 19:33:51 "Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you." I wondered why they didn't send the CEO of the NRA. He's an old white guy who couldn't utter such profane words. How she dared utter them herself is heartless and belittling to the "crying white mothers."
6818 2018-02-22 19:33:50 have u seen the state of the past british curling gold medalists ??( a bunch of middle aged housewifes from Fort William !
6819 2018-02-22 19:33:44 
6820 2018-02-22 19:33:40 I hope this India trip never ends! This is just pure gold as JT buries himself.
6821 2018-02-22 19:33:38 I know I'm often told that there's a pot of gold but I don't see a fucking rainbow and my coffee's cold
6822 2018-02-22 19:33:37 rose gold • fuchsia • pink

(colors that’ll be poppin this summer)
6823 2018-02-22 19:33:36 Entscheide dich: Wärst du lieber Gold bei einem Royale, oder eine Kamera beim Neo Magazin?

6825 2018-02-22 19:33:35 What do you get when you take two taboo breaking singers covering a solid gold all time disco classic? An absolute sack of caterwauling shite, is what #totp #totp85
6826 2018-02-22 19:33:32 Mmm, so there are things better than gold...
6827 2018-02-22 19:33:31 I hate to train 4 years and get a silver. I would of respectfully denied it. Gold or nothing.
6828 2018-02-22 19:33:27 E o que faz sucesso é as musicas do costa gold com o nog falando merda tnc

My gold medal 
6832 2018-02-22 19:33:19 Last month: "Teens are eating Tide pods on their avocado toast. We're doomed."

This month: "Teens are activists and gold medal athletes. The future of our country is bright."
6833 2018-02-22 19:33:17 EA shit the bed with the way they released the prime icons... wanted to play with prime gullit this FIFA but won’t happen cause I’m over FIFA 18
6834 2018-02-22 19:33:16 I do try to collect gold coins though. Haven't found any yet.
6835 2018-02-22 19:33:15 Canada, I don't need to tell you that was a hard fought tournament on a global scale. Silver is smoking hot
Yes, I like our girls gold very much.
6836 2018-02-22 19:33:14 If you are not pissed that it is a color other than gold then you are not a competitor!Both teams played great but only 1 gets a gold trophy.
6837 2018-02-22 19:33:08 First who cares what a money seeking gold digger has to say. Second, there is NO corroborating proof, only accusation by someone willing to sell her sad tale of woe. TOTAL BALOGNA!
6838 2018-02-22 19:33:03 (1 Peter 1:7 KJV) That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:
6839 2018-02-22 19:33:03 In the beginning of the graph in 2005, they were almost one line, but today there is a wide gap between spot gold and GLD.  That's because they sell off a part of their holding to pay fees.  It is a diminishing instrument.  Call us for more information. 888.696.4653
6840 2018-02-22 19:32:56 Asiyami Gold is living my life.
6841 2018-02-22 19:32:53 I never was a fan of the old clock tower logo..always felt it looked pretty generic & the blue made it look out of place next to all of the other school branding. I like the new one..I'm glad they kept the Winthrop lettering in the same font, but incorporated garnet/gold.
6842 2018-02-22 19:32:51 When everybody kept saying that the USA Hockey team didn't even make it to the Olympics, but those strong ass women actually just took the gold ?? Why y'all still acting like only the men's teams count ?? It's 2018 mf.
6843 2018-02-22 19:32:48 I saw !!!!
6844 2018-02-22 19:32:47 Congratualtions to Hungary  on winning their first ever Winter #Olympics Gold medal! #HUN #ShortTrack  #pyeongchang2018
6845 2018-02-22 19:32:47 I know it’s not Friday yet but seriously go follow @gidomme 
She’s a treat 
6846 2018-02-22 19:32:44 Why would the roads be gold if gold is only precious cuz HUMANS say it is..
6847 2018-02-22 19:32:41 Meghan good friend NRA Dana Loesch says she'll say this slowly so the media can hear it: "Many in legacy media love. Mass. Shootings. You guys love it." "You love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold."  These people are truly disgusting & have no place in the media.
6848 2018-02-22 19:32:41 @DLoesch Oddly, you didnt say this to the kids yesterday “Many in the media love mass shootings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold." I actually tried to listen& respect your opinion, even though i disagree w/u on many points. Sadly, that quote was unnecessary & U lost cred
6849 2018-02-22 19:32:41 The lefts goal is not to remove guns from criminals, but rather to remove guns from law abiding citizens. It is only they that will follow the law. Just like the old gold confiscation scam.
6850 2018-02-22 19:32:39 Congratulations to @TeamUSA Women's Hockey on winning #Gold after 20 years. #USA #Olympics
6851 2018-02-22 19:32:39 People of gold
6852 2018-02-22 19:32:34 Later I do the same with Gold, so I keep the best, I sim the rest for 10 matches then convert into trainers to level up my 4 teams to reach full potential 
6853 2018-02-22 19:32:33 Мы как-то короче с лыжами в 6-м коассе через окно сбегали.
6854 2018-02-22 19:32:31 Sarah, maybe its false. Whether you take offense at it or not is irrelevant.  Watching @CNN embarrass itself hosting an ugly mob last night does nothing to dispel perception that media is thrilled with this. Dirty Laundry isn't just another gold record on Don Henley's wall.
6855 2018-02-22 19:32:26 I do love the rivalry in Women's Hockey though. In fact, I wish they had a tournament for the bronze with all the other countries, and Canada and U.S. could have a best of seven for the gold.
6856 2018-02-22 19:32:24 Gold medal match is at 3am on Saturday  good thing I’m opening that day 
6857 2018-02-22 19:32:24 .@SInow athlete of 2018 must be @usahockey women's gold medal winning team. #TeamUSA
6858 2018-02-22 19:32:22 And always will be! I see the things you're achieved and so proud, but the gag is, there's so much more 
6859 2018-02-22 19:32:17 ……！人前でその名を呼ぶんじゃあないッ！……二人だけの秘密だぞ？
6860 2018-02-22 19:32:17 People should leave Joycelyne Larocque alone. These athletes play with their HEARTS & give it their ALL. Losing a gold medal game is emotional. #TeamCanada losing the HOCKEY gold medal game is beyond HEARTBREAKING for the athletes. She was only reacting to her disappointment.
6861 2018-02-22 19:32:16 I got invited to a toga party and I said no bc it sounded kinda yuck, then I saw the pictures from it and I really wish I coulda gone to be a fellow thot. Girls tiddies were pushed to their throats, boys just had a sheet on and their nips were out and there was a lot of gold 
6862 2018-02-22 19:32:15 I bought a yellow/gold crushed velvet chair today and I can NOT WAIT TO GO PICK IT UP and style it in my house omfffff
6863 2018-02-22 19:32:15 Yea. Pretty bad huh? Downright embarrassing for your #1 show at 97.5 lose to the #2 show at WIP.
6864 2018-02-22 19:32:09 Oddly, you didnt say this to the kids yesterday “Many in the media love mass shootings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold." I actually tried to listen& respect your opinion, even though i disagree with you on many points. Sadly, that quote was unnecessary and U lost cred w/me
6865 2018-02-22 19:32:07 I was feeling bad about the #Olympics for a bit and then I saw that Trump wants teachers to have guns so you can keep your gold medals.
6866 2018-02-22 19:32:04 How...? Like is the book made of rare materials? Graphemes cover? Writing is gold plating?
6867 2018-02-22 19:31:55 Them gold toes hot but you can’t wear them all the time
6868 2018-02-22 19:31:55 I JUST REMEMBER THERES A GOLD COVER
6869 2018-02-22 19:31:49 Please keep this movement strong. The others hope it will fade and they are betting it does. Stay strong and may I use a quote from my favorite book from when ai was your age. "Stay Gold"  Many friends, my age, are standing with you. Beside you.
6870 2018-02-22 19:31:46 Yeah, well is it because they picked Weber over Subban or because they already had a stacked team and Jeff Petry in place of Weber/Subban still win the gold? So picking Weber over Subban isn't really an argument that sways in favour of saying Weber is superior.
6871 2018-02-22 19:31:45 The level of cynicism displayed by the NRA is astonishing. "...Crying white mothers are ratings gold.” @DLoesch do you also kick puppies in your spare time??
6872 2018-02-22 19:31:44 A propos of nothing: Doesn't "Midas touch" mean the opposite of a good thing? Have we been using it wrong all this time? I mean, sure, everything you touch turns into gold, but then so does your food. And your partner. Your books, your telly remote, your cat, your Oyster card...
6873 2018-02-22 19:31:39 CONGRATULATIONS TO THE USA WOMANS OLYMPIC HOCKEY TEAM BEATING THE CANADIANS LAST NIGHT AND WINNING THE GOLD MEDAL !!
WAY TO GO LADIES !! USA 
6874 2018-02-22 19:31:38 Look folks..pull out or permanent either way STILL ALL REAL #GOLD anything yu want 6k 10k 14k 18k 22k   #GoldKilos
6875 2018-02-22 19:31:37 One of the most amazing/heartbreaking things about a championship hockey game, like the gold medal game, is just seeing the collective jubilation/heartbreak on the faces. You can just see all the emotion from just giving their all. I don’t think you see that in any other sport.
6876 2018-02-22 19:31:35 @MercadoBitcoin ja que vcs não vão comercializar o btc gold,  poderiam ao menos disponibilizar para nós transferirmos para outras carteiras  pois a promessa de vocês foi de que receberíamos  os btcgold  conforme a quantidade de btc tínhamos em carteira, e até agora nada
6877 2018-02-22 19:31:24 my ex used to scream at me and be petty if i was having a bad mental day and needed space and now i just get showered in love and affection until i feel okay to talk, THATS the difference between dirt and gold
6878 2018-02-22 19:31:19 It would compliment Tosh’s gold one beautifully!
6879 2018-02-22 19:31:19 Curling has got to be my favorite event for the Winter Olympics haha and now that USA is playing for gold I’m super hyped

6881 2018-02-22 19:31:07 Yeah....cause everybody trains for years to not get a gold and be the best.... ughhhhh
6882 2018-02-22 19:31:07 They shouldn't be handing out anything other than gold medals to begin with. There are no participation trophies at this level

6888 2018-02-22 19:30:57 Ich kann es nicht empfehlen Gold zu essen.
6889 2018-02-22 19:30:53 Keep your heads up girls! You played an amazing game, I suppose we could let them have one gold every 20 years, that’s ok
6890 2018-02-22 19:30:52 We have not won any Gold medals at winter olympics at all, until tonight :)

6893 2018-02-22 19:30:39 At least it doesn’t involve invoking the gold fringe on the flag!
6894 2018-02-22 19:30:36 Direct this tweet to the owners of Radio Gold. If u don’t know them, do ur research and you will find them within seconds cos they’re not unknown
6895 2018-02-22 19:30:34 Was a great game.. the Winter Olympics overall have been pretty good.  Cant wait to see the US men’s curling team go for gold.. the snowboarding and skiing have been rad as well.
6896 2018-02-22 19:30:30 Was Turnbull injured late in the #CANvsUSA Gold Medal game?  I thought she was one of the best Canadian forwards the last two games..and not sure she saw the ice in OT.  One of the reasons the Canadians were so spent I think, used too few late.

6898 2018-02-22 19:30:28 I know that. I think a gold medal shouldn’t be decided on a shootout. I’m not blaming the loss on the shootout. I just don’t like it. Whether Canada won or lost
6899 2018-02-22 19:30:20 @ChuckSullivan15 I get some credit for helping Team Shuster get to the gold medal game. If I hadn't fired him up with my Twitter trash talk, they'd be on a flight home by now ;)
6900 2018-02-22 19:30:20 She had me until she said afterwards "Many in the media love mass shootings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold.". What a bitch.

6912 2018-02-22 19:29:40 the US Women's Hockey team winning gold is evidence that women can do anything men can but better.

6934 2018-02-22 19:28:48 Team USA men (including @_thp's doppelganger) go for curling GOLD at 00:35 Saturday morning (aka Friday night just after midnight CST).
6935 2018-02-22 19:28:44 In a Gold ETF you can never take physical possession of anything.  All you have is a piece of paper that is a share in a trust.  It is designed to mimic spot gold.  Chart to follow......

6941 2018-02-22 19:28:36 Why are people calling the US women's hockey gold another Miracle on Ice? C'mon. Not even close. They lost gold medal game in overtime 4 years ago. Give them their due. #USAvsCAN #Olympics

6947 2018-02-22 19:28:21 @971theticketxyt  What loser blood you have.  One gold in 20 years.  Go make a movie about it. You should thank Canada for developing the game in your country.  Can't wait for Auston Matthews to raise the Cup in Toronto, with Shannahan's big smile next to him. #getreal
6948 2018-02-22 19:28:21 You smart
6949 2018-02-22 19:28:18 You forgot to mention all the other freebies NHS & whilst on benefits all the exemptions it's a gold mine for them . We cannot be an international spoon feeder being a small nation they should stay behind & help their own country.
6950 2018-02-22 19:28:16 That's why the U.S hasn't won gold in 20 years. Gold or bust for Canada that's what we expect and that's what they expect. It's only a two horse race in women's hockey.

6954 2018-02-22 19:28:08 This isn’t “erasing his entire existence.” Yuzuru Hanyu has made his mark with 2 consecutive Olympic gold medals. Kind of hard to “erase.”  It’s a beautiful drawing that was *inspired* by the *inspirational* performances at the Olympics.

6956 2018-02-22 19:28:01 John, you definitely didn't earn the gold in this debate. Zoltan, congratulations.
6957 2018-02-22 19:28:01 Yeah that's been a thing with Target's systems for a long time. It works with those Ubisoft Gold versions too (e.g. South Park Gold Edition is $30 too)

6968 2018-02-22 19:27:33 Why couldn't the @adndotcom get a story in there before deadline about #USWomensHockey winning gold? Game must have ended by 10 p.m. Alaska time.

6972 2018-02-22 19:27:27 In the US and Canada, especially in womens hockey, it's Gold or Bust. If you don't win gold, you failed.
6973 2018-02-22 19:27:23 Solo so far.  Lono and Aaron have it, just haven't had a chance to meet up.  Had to watch that #usawomenshockey win the gold like a boss last night!:)
6974 2018-02-22 19:27:22 I was going hard on Hanzo last night, wasted and was still getting gold medal everything,
6975 2018-02-22 19:27:21 Today has gotta be one of the darkest days in Canadian sports history. They lost in 2 gold medal games to the US in sports they pride themselves on while us Americans don’t know 90% of the women on our hockey team and barely know the rules to curling lol
6976 2018-02-22 19:27:10 Your tweet was comedy gold
6977 2018-02-22 19:27:09 It'll be fine. He'll stay and spend years wondering why they were unable to build a competitor around him. And then he'll retire, and spend his twilight years fishing with Mats Sundin, Markus Naslund and Alfie. 
Swedish Sitcom Gold.
6978 2018-02-22 19:27:07 Canadian fans dislike SOs because they’ve have had the most to lose: Olys (94&98), a WJC and now Women’s Olys. During that time they’ve really only won a SO in SFs at WJCs (07, 09) and QFs at Olys (92), Canada has never won SO with gold on line.

7001 2018-02-22 19:26:10 DUH, You had to WIN the Right to play for Gold. Lose the game and get nothing?
You seem to think it's a consolation prize, when in fact Both teams WON the right to play for Gold
7002 2018-02-22 19:26:09 I think they sign up to 400 autos per day, not sure. It depends on how many vips,gold and platinum want an autograph. It'll be hard for GA. I'll be at will call on Friday, I'll try to go straight to his line and I'll see. I don't feel like spending all day in a queue.
7003 2018-02-22 19:26:08 I was getting educated 
7004 2018-02-22 19:26:05 From my point of view W/E has this high value item, & a very interested buyer. I'd be taking this club for all I could, making demands & getting it all in legal docs.

7009 2018-02-22 19:26:02 Doesn’t matter how many Olympics I’ve watched or what sport is taking place, watching the emotion of an individual or team when they realize they’ve won a gold medal will always give me goosebumps.

7018 2018-02-22 19:25:36 headline on @TSN_Sports and @cbcsports, "Canada's gold-medal hopes in men's curling dashed by U.S.". No guys, Canada missed their shots and lost all on their own. Canada beat themselves in that game.

7020 2018-02-22 19:25:32 Lowest medal count at the olympics in decades. 

Imagine, US women’s hockey wins the gold and immediately thinking “TRUMP!”
7021 2018-02-22 19:25:29 One thing for sure...she’ll take the gold for phony and incapable. Runs in the family.

7024 2018-02-22 19:25:24 El USD y el Gold solo estan consolidandose... dentro de un rectangulo de consolidacion....  Consolidando sus respectivas tendencias.
7025 2018-02-22 19:25:18 The consent video for sure. You're gold in the star wars academy too. Solid all around. Good luck!
7026 2018-02-22 19:25:15 Gold medal for Intensity! 
7027 2018-02-22 19:25:13 Agreed. If they did 3 shooters instead of 5, Canada would be gold medalists right now. Just goes to show how dumb shootouts are. Especially ones that allow the same shooter multiple attempts.
7028 2018-02-22 19:25:09 Well, you won't see or here me say that about your team. :) I'm the one who wants to send NHL players to the Olympics because a gold medal is more important to me than the Stars winning a Cup. They did that in my lifetime, so I'm fine. haha!
7029 2018-02-22 19:25:05 생각이 많아졌네. 그 생각이 네 거울을 가려서 널 똑바로 볼 수가 없어. 눈앞의 길마저 흐리네. 부디 눈 똑바로 뜨길 바라. 그렇지 않으면 오늘, 완전히 안개에 휩싸여 헤매게 될 테니까.
7030 2018-02-22 19:25:04 The Dana Loesch lady getting roasted is amazing cuz every answer she gives is supposed to be PR gold as she spins everything to try and pin blame onto anyone BUT the NRA, but it's like a public execution of her character

7041 2018-02-22 19:24:32 Ahahahahha “Jenny from the blockchain” is gold.
7042 2018-02-22 19:24:31 Any of those goofs criticizing women’s hockey before Oly should have watched that game, awesome hockey; and if letting the US have a gold once every 20 yrs helps growth & ratings in US I can live with that

7051 2018-02-22 19:24:17 As a Canadian watching the women go for gold last night, I give full credit to the female @TeamUSA They were very deserving of the gold medal IMO
7052 2018-02-22 19:24:15 Its interesting that she points out “ratings gold” but fails to mention that the NRA uses these events to push the false narrative that the government is going to come take a persons guns away..to increase membership!
7053 2018-02-22 19:24:15 I KNOW RIGHT?!?!? Which is why I am baffled at the lack of marketing, investment, ANYTHING for swtor! If Blizzard/Activison produced this game (A. Everything they touch turns to gold) they would be marketing this game like a Girl Scout selling cookies outside a gym!
7054 2018-02-22 19:24:14 I've personally used Veldt Gold for buying silver in the US recently, great experience.
7055 2018-02-22 19:24:14 Today, I was carrying my hockey gear down the street to my  car, and two people in the span of two blocks said, "How about that gold medal game last night?!" Even if it was just for one magical night, people were excited about hockey.
7056 2018-02-22 19:24:12 I’m strangling Gold Roger in Hell
7057 2018-02-22 19:24:05 Refilwe 
7058 2018-02-22 19:24:04 Technically you don’t win silver in hockey ... you win gold and even bronze, you’re given silver immediately after losing.
7059 2018-02-22 19:24:03 Well to start Todd was behind when he made the bet with ya . I've watched the show since day 1 he has no knowledge no ethic and your 100% correct he couldn't find gold in a jewelry store . congrats on all of the hard work you put in . and if you ever need any. Help shoot me a msg
7060 2018-02-22 19:24:01 Aaaaaaaaaaah hahahaha hahahaha
This is gold!!!!
7061 2018-02-22 19:23:59 As far as I am concerned both Canada and US won gold last in women’s hockey. A shootout is a ridiculous way to decide the highest honour of any tournament. It proves nothing and remains unresolved.
7062 2018-02-22 19:23:57 Removing a silver medal after not receiving a gold is a bullshit/disrespectful move. I dont care what country youre from.. you dont deserve it at that point.
7063 2018-02-22 19:23:57 Totally agree - that name was made for green and gold
7064 2018-02-22 19:23:53 Only 90s kids remember missing out on the domain name gold rush

7076 2018-02-22 19:23:24 Would love to but don't have Gold, unfortunately. Still so many of the lines and scenes are in my memory so have them there to call upon any day, any time!
7077 2018-02-22 19:23:21 Get on it lad, these last few days have been a stream of liquid gold for a fan of yours; would be cool to be able to come back to it all at any time, sure it'd take a lifetime though, your portfolio seems huge.
7078 2018-02-22 19:23:19 All my family  know Ben personally and he is such a lovely lad...

7082 2018-02-22 19:23:04 I know gold is not enough
7083 2018-02-22 19:23:00 This is gold... and the back scratcher at the end lmfao
7084 2018-02-22 19:22:59 I don't understand the hate for the Canadian hockey player who took off the silver medal after she got it. I would say it was unsportsmanlike in any other competition but in hockey, you play for gold, no one cares about the silver or bronze in hockey.
7085 2018-02-22 19:22:56 Don’t need to be Haitian to do all that
7086 2018-02-22 19:22:56 I love seeing my girl friends dating, in healthy relationships with guys who treat them like complete GOLD. It's about time my beauties get treated the right damn way.
7087 2018-02-22 19:22:56 
7088 2018-02-22 19:22:54 lol. Alright then. Well they won gold so job well done I’d say.
7089 2018-02-22 19:22:54 great article but FYI the gold medal game rules are 20 minute 4-on-4 OT. It's only 10 mins for the playoff rounds/bronze game

7091 2018-02-22 19:22:48 Can you or the Media delve into your personal history?Seems the biggest screamers abt Trump have skeletons in their closet.I'm sure your past is pristine,been handing out Gold to the masses have you???
       Start the change Judd,amaze us with ur perfect life.

7093 2018-02-22 19:22:41 Greasy. They deserved to win but just a bad way to decide a gold medal game
7094 2018-02-22 19:22:37 In a team sport like hockey, two teams win their final games: gold and bronze.
7095 2018-02-22 19:22:36 ATU is missing out on the gold mine that is El Paso Avenue
7096 2018-02-22 19:22:36 Congrats to US girls for beating Canada for the Olympic gold. Role models for my daughter who watched the whole game.
7097 2018-02-22 19:22:33 Will you share this with me?
'Cause darling without you
All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the nightsky
Will never be enough

Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but it'll
Never be enough 
7098 2018-02-22 19:22:32 If the government poisons you just uphevelter the miss and toucan the gold.
7099 2018-02-22 19:22:29 But also proportionate and balanced and not “gold plating” the already strong UK law-also taking into consideration many national differences. ... and giving final say to national governments.
7100 2018-02-22 19:22:27 I was just asked...If you can have 2-man bob sleigh end in a tie why not other sports? Canada Gold...USA Gold...eh ehhhh enhhhh?!?!?!????
7101 2018-02-22 19:22:25 I put 1$ at 80:1 on the Men’s curling team to win Olympic gold when they were 2-4... They have won 4 straight are now in the finals vs Sweden.  I am officially the biggest curling fan I’ve ever met

7105 2018-02-22 19:22:21 She already has a gold!  A lot of the teams/players would have loved to have been where she was standing getting a silver medal.  What a poor sport and it's really disappointing to see.
7106 2018-02-22 19:22:20 Congratulations #USWomensHockey on first gold since 1998. @TeamUSA picking up momentum as #Olympics go on. Good luck to the #USCurling men's team in gold medal match vs. Sweden.
7107 2018-02-22 19:22:20 @TeamShuster Great game guys! I just watched the win over Canada in the semifinals and got choked up with the final rock. So fun to see you guys get some Olympic redemption. Now take home the gold!

7114 2018-02-22 19:22:02 At the Legislature Christmas party in 2010, the following joke was told about FB statuses:
"Marty Gold.... this status was canceled by Stephanie Forsyth"
And the NDP MLA's laughed.
7115 2018-02-22 19:22:00 Yes, they did.
7116 2018-02-22 19:21:56 just like Gold Star families...they deserve our compassion and a free reign on speaking their pain.
7117 2018-02-22 19:21:51 Bnb old but gold
7118 2018-02-22 19:21:50 Yeah I think Pierre mentioned that U.S. goalie Maddie Rooney was 7 months old when they last won gold in '98 only about 15 times last night

7157 2018-02-22 19:20:22 @JJPeterson75   knowing that your joy is now complete after both the USA Woman's Hockey Gold and US Men's curling win over Canada - this Canadian is slightly less bothered by these losses

7169 2018-02-22 19:19:52 Though she removed her Silver medal when it was given to her, the other hockey players of @HC_Women were gracious to receive theirs. While it is in the Canadian spirit to never give up and strive for Gold, second place is nothing to be ashamed of. Congratulations @usahockey!

7174 2018-02-22 19:19:43 I hope he wins next season!
7175 2018-02-22 19:19:43 This is Thundercat gold. My only question is... where's Snarf?!?
7176 2018-02-22 19:19:43 Friday, February 23rd is a Gold Day!!
7177 2018-02-22 19:19:41 Smiling from ear to ear watching our girls get the gold put around their necks  I am v gay
7178 2018-02-22 19:19:39 Bronze in Men's Curling, Gold in Men's hockey, and 4 more in there somewhere out of the 20 events left making their total 30. #Olympics #PyeongChang2018
7179 2018-02-22 19:19:37 You’re all gold medal winners in my books
7180 2018-02-22 19:19:35 Gold mentality
7181 2018-02-22 19:19:34 This is gold.  
7182 2018-02-22 19:19:32 Thanks! I stayed up late watching the Canada / USA Women’s Gold Medal Game so the caffeine was much needed today!
7183 2018-02-22 19:19:16 Due to the early dismissal, there will be NO session at Gold’s today. See you all next week for our LAST session before the season 
7184 2018-02-22 19:19:15 It sucks because I could easily get Gold 2/Gold 1 but this game is just too stressful that it’s not worth the grind.

7187 2018-02-22 19:19:10 US Women’s Hockey just gave a big old “screw you” to not getting equal pay with that gold medal  
7188 2018-02-22 19:19:06 Thats gold! Unfollowed for the sake of the friendship 
7189 2018-02-22 19:19:06 I agree with you 100% - mass shootings are ratings gold. I bet banning weapons like the AR-15 would really take a bite out of them.
7190 2018-02-22 19:19:03 That Sol Campbell interview is absolute gold. Even funnier for the way his voice goes so high pitched it’s like he has a vice clamped around his testicles. Keep em rolling sol man

7198 2018-02-22 19:18:43 If overthinking was a sport I’d definitely have a gold medal 
7199 2018-02-22 19:18:42 @Issa_GOLD haven’t been on Twitter  in a long time glad i can see you prospering man always respected ya
7200 2018-02-22 19:18:41 @usahockey women's team bringing home gold for the first time since 98 against our eternal nemesis/friends from Canada! What a win!
7201 2018-02-22 19:18:41 Yeah yeah. I hate the idea of buying a medal. But I get them Gold eventually
7202 2018-02-22 19:18:39 Gerry I started reading floppies in 2012 when you & @thebrianposehn started writing Deadpool. It was the Marvel Now! relaunch that brought me in, before that I trade waited. This 5 year run has been the gold standard & best the character ever had. Thank you all so much.

7204 2018-02-22 19:18:31 Últimamente le tengo mucho miedo a @sofi_gold .. general estoy a tus ordenes. jajajaja
7205 2018-02-22 19:18:29 Depends on the kind, I think. There’s a pretty huge width to the style but those who don’t explore it are doomed to hear whatever washes up on their shore.

I’m loving it anew since digging back into its roots, honestly. There is GOLD in the last half-decade of Future Bass.
7206 2018-02-22 19:18:26 ...song along...."....gold medals are a girl's best friend...."         ...who cares about diamonds...      Well Done Ladies !!!!   USA !!!!
7207 2018-02-22 19:18:22 I’m watching the replay of the women’s gold medal Olympic game blissfully unaware of the outcome.

Freaking overtime time!

7215 2018-02-22 19:18:00 This interview with @PlatinumPerry is pure gold. @arielhelwani

7222 2018-02-22 19:17:33 See! I have no idea what that even means! This is pure gold! Which bus route are you on? I wanna see you mutter this stuff in person!
7223 2018-02-22 19:17:30 Yes, so you can thank me for the gold.
7224 2018-02-22 19:17:30 I do congratulate you on the gold Chris, I only feel the US has to do some major movement on the gun policy with those pricks @realDonaldTrump and @NRA.  Great hockey though sir.
7225 2018-02-22 19:17:20 @msfhr webinar on Implementation science... if boring webinars were an olympic discipline we would have a gold-medal contestant right here
7226 2018-02-22 19:17:19 I mean, there's the idk why I put at the beginning. Maybe it's the gold in the middle and on the gun part?
7227 2018-02-22 19:17:17 You didn't ask for it in gold bricks?
7228 2018-02-22 19:17:14 They played an amazing game. USA Might have gotten gold this time but I bet it will be another amazing match in four years. #TeamCanada #TeamUSA
7229 2018-02-22 19:17:12 I don’t think he knows how valuable gold is
7230 2018-02-22 19:17:11 If I ever got a gold medal, it would be flour
7231 2018-02-22 19:17:09 Four months ago, I sat next to Nicole Hensley at a Lindenwood/Minnesota Women's Hockey game, talking about her making a spot on the Olympic roster. Today, she's a gold medalist. Congrats, @NicHens29. You earned it.
7232 2018-02-22 19:17:06 Anyone could see the road that they walked on was paved in gold~
7233 2018-02-22 19:17:06 Everyone is Gold in this group except ur buddy. I don’t like how I was talked to. I don’t talk U guys this way & the same back.

7239 2018-02-22 19:16:48 Crazy that 4 months ago I was drinking beer with Shuster now he’s competing for a gold medal in South Korea
7240 2018-02-22 19:16:43 CNN & MSMBC should have cut their camera's when those dirty bastard at the CPAC conference with their disgusting statenents The women who spoke for NRA last nite said today the media likes mass shooting & white women cry gold tears. What kind of tears would she cry

7246 2018-02-22 19:16:29 Surprised that I managed to stay off social media for nearly 18 hours and thus avoided learning the outcome of the gold-medal women's hockey game until seeing #cbcolympics' truncated version this AM. Thank you @HC_Women for a hard-fought game and a great tournament. #NoShame

7258 2018-02-22 19:15:51 She is vile. I just saw a clip of here speech saying that msm loves mass shootings because white women’s tears are ratings gold. Absolutely disgusting.
7259 2018-02-22 19:15:51 Yes and you’ve always been supportive of me from day one 
7260 2018-02-22 19:15:50 @pettyyankeefan congrats on the us women hockey gold

7264 2018-02-22 19:15:42 Just saw the the states beat Canada in a shootout last night for the gold medal.
How proud are you my American counterparts that the only way you were able to beat our ladies was in a skills competition?
7265 2018-02-22 19:15:40 Very clever. Gold star

7267 2018-02-22 19:15:31 On @ 2: Did you stay up to watch #USA win gold in womens hockey? #Bulls are back. Will their plan to win less work in last 25 games? #NBA lottery possibilities. Mark Cuban/#Mavs latest. More #MLB pace of play ideas. @keithlaw talks #Cubs & Sox.
7268 2018-02-22 19:15:30 You're going to characterize the whole team based on one player?
I acknowledge she put in a level of work I don't understand to win gold and I'm sure in the moment she was ticked. I think she'll wish she hadn't done that after the frustration subsides.

7270 2018-02-22 19:15:27 I am not a fan of calling mentally ill crazy people or lunatics.  I felt compassion from Mark Rubio but nothing genuine about this gal especially after her statement today with different audience that “media love mass shootings and crying white mothers are ratings gold”.

7272 2018-02-22 19:15:19 I think it has to do with the fact that you just lost a game so the fact that you "won" something is hard to grasp. You've just had gold so close you could taste it and then it's gone 
7273 2018-02-22 19:15:11 Nope. Canadians wouldn’t lie about their maple syrup. Liquid gold.
7274 2018-02-22 19:15:11 Is there an Olympics for obsessing over stupid things you've said because I'd definitely win the gold.
7275 2018-02-22 19:15:04 Plus I got my gold chain back after soooo long of having a naked neck. 
7276 2018-02-22 19:15:02 Good call citing maybe 12 people out of the millions of fans, because that’s an accurate way to describe the mass.  When the Vikings win a super bowl I expect you to stand up and give a mediocre golf clap...bc ya know, it’s not that serious

7287 2018-02-22 19:14:43 Totally agree Janet.  I know the rules are the rules but it's a cheap way to end a gold medal game.  Glad the NHL doesn't use it in the playoffs.

Dana Loesch said she'll say this slowly so the media can hear it: "Many in legacy media love. Mass. Shootings. You guys love it." "You love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold."

WTF do you call that?
7303 2018-02-22 19:14:15 Exactly what is wrong with America currently. Listen, you have the right to not like the Coach, but calling him out immediately after winning the gold is insane. Enjoy the moment, and quit over analyzing EVERYTHING!

7312 2018-02-22 19:13:58 After 20 years of dominating the sport, it was very nice of the Canadian women's hockey team to give their neighbours a gold medal. Must have been pretty frustrating falling short time and time again. #USAvsCAN
7313 2018-02-22 19:13:57 Reese It Was An Epic Game One We Will Never Forget These Women Were Bound For Gold
7314 2018-02-22 19:13:56 BTC has never been a stable (!) store of value and therefore in no way comparable to true store of value like gold.. (apart from a period when no one cared).. BTC equals volatility and speculation, to a lesser extent compared to alts..
7315 2018-02-22 19:13:56 Easy there, I'm not sure we want to start throwing insults when it comes to arrogance. We pretty much win the gold in that every year  I think he was just saying for Canadians, silver isn't good enough in hockey. Same as how we feel about winning silver in Olympic basketball

7317 2018-02-22 19:13:50 Maybe if @Devito_F3 had offered donuts for the first 3 to make it around the bases... Gold, Silver and Bronze?
7318 2018-02-22 19:13:47 Scammer!
7319 2018-02-22 19:13:45 These are so condition sensitive that the chances of another gold gem is slim.  My Elias base auto has chipping on the back.  He is hot right now.  He seems to be in Facebook groups at least.
7320 2018-02-22 19:13:42 Yes ma’am. $7 . And they’ll be measured around your waist so they won’t be too big or small and break. Any color of the rainbow, we also have gold, rose gold, silver, bronze, and clear

7323 2018-02-22 19:13:35 Congrats to President Mahoney and @winthropu for coming up with a uniting new logo. And thank you for keeping Garnet and Gold. Never liked the blue anyway.
7324 2018-02-22 19:13:35 Same bike but coloured fins at the front perhaps? All gold feels too much to me.
7325 2018-02-22 19:13:34 this vid is literally me when I open a chest and a gold scar comes out
7326 2018-02-22 19:13:32 Though I wish I could pull off that gold outfit as well as he does.

7332 2018-02-22 19:13:17 @MeghanMcCain @TheView 
I just listened to your impassioned defense of the NRA @ your good friend @DLoesch just said at CPAC that we who are in favor of gun control that we love to have mass shootings white women are ratings gold. What is the defense of this sick statement?
7333 2018-02-22 19:13:17 Congrats to the Women's @USAHockey Team on winning the gold medal in the #WinterOlympics! 

A special congratulations to @maddie_rooney35, @LeeSteck2, @sidneymorin, @KPan19, @GigiMarvin, @hannahbrandt16, @AmandaKessel8, and @DaniCam9 for representing Minnesota well!
7334 2018-02-22 19:13:14 lol very true, took away a lot of its thunder. I respect the technology, but it's mostly irrational hype right now IMO. Plus, there's enough capital left for gold in all the central bank inflated bubbles :)
7335 2018-02-22 19:13:14 How do you feel about the USA winning the Gold in curling? Ik you must be as thrilled as anybody

7341 2018-02-22 19:13:04 What about love for the rest of our gold medalists? Or medalists in general? 

Do you even know how hockey is played?
7342 2018-02-22 19:12:56 When you’ve made 6 straight gold medal games, and your country has won 5 of them, this stuff is gonna happen hahaha (not that I agree with her or think it’s right)
7343 2018-02-22 19:12:54 not a mistake but a gold apportunity

7348 2018-02-22 19:12:44 I like how our Olympic team won gold and it not political but the left in the comments are still making it political. Like come on this has nothing to do with conservatives or liberals. We should all be cheering for our athletes
7349 2018-02-22 19:12:43 In the past 3 years, @PKessel81 has won 2 Stanley Cups and @AmandaKessel8 has won an Olympic Gold Medal. The Kessels are officially the first family of American hockey.

7351 2018-02-22 19:12:39 Not to mention the fact that you don't measure a dollar in gold.  A currency must be valued and weighted against that which determines it's price, such as trade, hence Trade-Weighted Indices.  The stupidity/dishonesty here is breathtaking

7360 2018-02-22 19:12:17 なに言ってんだ？
7361 2018-02-22 19:12:16 Why did @danaloesch say at #cpac2018 that "crying WHITE mothers" are media ratings gold? Why did she intentionally qualify the skin color of grieving mothers? 

Because she thinks white pain has more value societal value than black or brown pain.

7375 2018-02-22 19:11:47 They talk about how mass shootings are gold for the media but the irony is that they’re gold for gun and ammunition manufacturers, who are the real people the NRA supports. After every shooting their stock prices .

7381 2018-02-22 19:11:33 Some online intl news reports hyping it as if we've just struck black gold.

"Seeping" doesn't automatically translate to a significant find.

I am awaiting news on the official detailed geological report that is to be submitted to GoJ.
7382 2018-02-22 19:11:30 I really could use the afternoon off to catch up on all of the sleep I have missed out the past two days watching the Men's & Women's hockey games that went to shootouts. It was worth it though to see the Women win the gold! #olympics

7392 2018-02-22 19:11:15 FUCKING GOLD YES
7393 2018-02-22 19:11:15 I don't want to tell you time and time again: how much I care, because a monkey with a gold tail intructed me to do it. youknowiwouldneverdothat
7394 2018-02-22 19:11:15 Drew a new piece today: a stylish gold pursue!
7395 2018-02-22 19:11:10 I understand the grief assoc. w/ losing a gold medal, but this is completely uncalled for and very unsportsmanlike. When Jocelyne Larocque took her silver off immediately, it set's a poor example. There is grace in defeat as well as winning. She should remember that. #TeamCanada
7396 2018-02-22 19:11:10 Poor sportsmanship! Having emotions and feeling disappointed is one thing but not wearing the medal bc its not gold is childish and disrespectful to the game and her teammates! She should be embarrassed, this is definitely not good role modeling for young children.
7397 2018-02-22 19:11:07 I got one of those at home.. he loves it when we throw his toys down the wooden floor hallway. He knows exactly when to stop running & slide his way right up to the toy! He'd win Gold at the #Doggylympics

7398 2018-02-22 19:11:05 Dunno, but I would check with the gold bugs, they have some great theories.
7399 2018-02-22 19:11:05 Maybe. I prefer the gold and silver winning Bloemen
7400 2018-02-22 19:11:04 @DLoesch really?? Addressing the @NRA....Who says this??? “You guys love it.....I’m not saying you guys love the tragedy but I am saying you love the ratings....Crying white mothers are ratings gold”.  I almost THOUGHT you had a (small) heart last night.

7402 2018-02-22 19:11:00 Congrats!!! Hard not winning the gold but glad it went to such a worthy opponent. 
7403 2018-02-22 19:11:00 NPR's @DLoesch Loves mass shootings. Images of crying white mothers on TV are advertising gold. Her nipples practically shoot through her blouse at the sound of gun store cash registers ringing in the #FOMO hysteria that follows every massacre.
7404 2018-02-22 19:10:58 That gold is INSANE
7405 2018-02-22 19:10:58 If you won a gold medal would you put your hand over your heart while they played the anthem? I have never done that and it would not even occur to me to do so
7406 2018-02-22 19:10:56 Haha I know I’ve liked pretty much every pic of her  it was a gold mine of cute
7407 2018-02-22 19:10:56 Winning an Olympic gold medal is more likely than being 1 outed on the river? Maybe if smoking crack was an Olympic event!?
7408 2018-02-22 19:10:52 Assault rifles are literally gold for the NRA.  Afraid  you won't get a bonus next Christmas?
7409 2018-02-22 19:10:51 Seriously, what is the name of the cross country skiing color commentator? I need to know this. He's a commentating legend. He makes every moment of a 45-minute race electrifying and his call on the US gold medal is one of the best ever.
7410 2018-02-22 19:10:51 Yo estoy como a 0 de pasta... Así que por eso digo Gold
7411 2018-02-22 19:10:49 This just tells me that all of that these paper "markets" are fake and completely computer driven illusions and frauds. I mean the #dollar or $DXY is itself a totally nonsense/arbitrary index (measuring toilet paper vs toilet paper)! #Idiocracy
7412 2018-02-22 19:10:48 We need to take off our gold and black tinted spectacles and realise it's ok to say when a player has a stinker ... last night Ruddy cost us points so I think we are allowed to be a bit pissed off ?

7415 2018-02-22 19:10:34 Same as gold/peach: too hard to distinguish from the background. 

I could add outlines but then I think that would confuse things. :-/

ALTHOUGH... maybe if the outlines were gray rather than black. So even the black shapes are outlined. Hrmmmmm.....
7416 2018-02-22 19:10:33 I may have already purchased it and the main PvE game as it’s currently 50% off on Xbox gold (17.50 for standard instead of 35, super deluxe is 35 instead of £75)
7417 2018-02-22 19:10:30 So #JocelyneLarocque highlighted her  team in a more negative light by being selfish. Her pain/anger of Losing wasn’t  greater than her teammates. Now the media is focusing on her and her unsportsmanship moment. She’s the first loser in my books. #GoTeamCanada #TeamUSAWomen #gold

Fear that he may drop everything and pursue their spots on the team has pushed them to greater heights and all the way to the Gold Medal Game. Thank you, Clay, for your part in their success.

7428 2018-02-22 19:10:16 Deserved to lose gold. Lack luster 1 period, Lazy 3rd period skating and bad passes. Not to mention bad penalties. They are lucky they were given a shoot out.

7433 2018-02-22 19:10:02 And the worst part is that other prominent medallists from this Games, Sui & Han, Papadakis & Cizeron, Jin and Chen all have realistic chances of medalling or winning Gold in 2022. But for Zhenya, with the up and coming Russian and Japanese fields, it looks very bleak :(

7440 2018-02-22 19:09:49 U snowflakes are so weak! You don't win a silver medal, you lose the gold!  So of course she's pissed.  I don't blame her. She will work hard and most likely win a gold next time, unlike u snowflakes who give up!
7441 2018-02-22 19:09:47 Team Canada isn’t  entitled to Gold every time. They were just the best team for 20 years. Team USA came out on top last night. This chick needs to grow up and move on, as team USA has done in the past
7442 2018-02-22 19:09:47 Is there a medal other than gold these people would prefer?
7443 2018-02-22 19:09:44 I'm very proud of the Women's hockey team bringing home the Gold. Great job ladies!

7452 2018-02-22 19:09:34 I know you are American , it’s all good. Canada lost. They have won 5 gold medals in a row. The USA earned that gold. They were the better team last night.
7453 2018-02-22 19:09:23 True, but you don’t win silver. You lose gold.

7456 2018-02-22 19:09:18 Shocked, not shocked.

D.T. wins presidency.
Kid shoots up school.
Baltimore council selects #DarrylDeSousa with known, brightly colored red flags to reform BPD.

All media gold.
7457 2018-02-22 19:09:09 If Marte returns to form, you have a gold glove left fielder. If Polanco blossoms, you have a top 10 right fielder.
7458 2018-02-22 19:09:05 It will never get old hearing the "HERE COMES DIGGINS!" "GOLD" Call
7459 2018-02-22 19:08:58 And you get a gold star for being the first calm, rational, mature response to a comment of mine from someone on the "other side" that I've gotten today :)

7462 2018-02-22 19:08:46 The margaritas specials always with gold or  silver.  I need double anejo or reposado with grand Marnier in my margaritas
7463 2018-02-22 19:08:42 Look at that loot! Diamonds, gold, rubies! It must be worth over a hundred bucks!
7464 2018-02-22 19:08:41 Yo, why even have silver and bronze medals? It should be gold, and participation ribbons all around. #jocelynelarocqueforPM
7465 2018-02-22 19:08:37 Glitterli olan her şeyi seviyorum her şeyiii tabutum rose gold ve glitterli olsun lütfen
7466 2018-02-22 19:08:37 I was doing the exact same thing at the same time. Caught the gold-medal match once OT start. 1st pint. Then watched the shoot-out. 2nd pint. No tequila shots to celebrate the win, but went to be with a smile.
7467 2018-02-22 19:08:37 Everything you decide to do is gold
7468 2018-02-22 19:08:36 Gurl I feel the same way. There's a restaurant in philly that does a "gourmet philly cheesesteak" and it's $500 cause it has truffles (which are also awful), edible gold leaf, and like wagyu beef
7469 2018-02-22 19:08:35 PH 4x200 wins gold!
7470 2018-02-22 19:08:35 I find it interesting that blue (in the presence of red) makes you think of cold/hot. And presumably makes you think that they should have some real diference in function?

I tried gold, grey - and even orange and peach. But I need to prioritise the actual game, not 'brand'. :-/

7472 2018-02-22 19:08:31 Weird. Sports show right ? Yet you don’t stay up to watch Women’s Hockey Gold medal game . Your show is useless
7473 2018-02-22 19:08:26 That's absolute gold.
7474 2018-02-22 19:08:25 he would have to wear gold with you :-D

7477 2018-02-22 19:08:19 Then play the bronze medallist for the silver, then you can say you won it. You earn silver by getting to gold final. Means you actually did win it. Saying you don't win silver is just stupid.
7478 2018-02-22 19:08:17 I’ve gotta get the Real ID gold star this time, which apparently involves bringing in a bunch of extra documentation.

7480 2018-02-22 19:08:14 Sad but your country will not be proud of your actions and you may not be ask to continue...you are not guarantee the gold.
7481 2018-02-22 19:08:12 Take note that white supremacist .@DLoesch made a SPECIFIC point of stating “..crying WHITE mothers are ratings gold.” Confirmation that the USA, #NRA #GOP is exploiting racial fear. #parkland #guncontrol #resist

7490 2018-02-22 19:07:56 @GuyRWhitehead Buddy,  will be cheering for your guys to bring home the curling gold. It’s already been a great boost for the sport, and a win would be off the charts. Let’s go, !
7491 2018-02-22 19:07:56 @BLHS_Principal Will Friday be green or gold?
7492 2018-02-22 19:07:55 #Bitcoin certainly did what they thought Gold would do.   LOL
7493 2018-02-22 19:07:53 Since Trump is being given credit for the gold medal of the USA women, then it's his fault that the USA men "suck shit"; thanks for pointing that out.
7494 2018-02-22 19:07:49 Someone should tell the IIHF dude that if gold medal games weren’t decided in a shootout it might be easier to wear a sliver medal!
7495 2018-02-22 19:07:45 Can I interest you in an undervalued gold mining stock??
7496 2018-02-22 19:07:43 Long Guns are flying off the shelves. Its like a 2nd gold rush for the gun industry. Bravo, Idiots. Threatening to ban everything has done wonders for the proliferation of firearms.
7497 2018-02-22 19:07:39 Petulant child, respect and honor your team mates and country. If you deserved the gold, you would have it.
7498 2018-02-22 19:07:38 I feel like Trump with use the woman's hockey gold to try and get re elected.

7507 2018-02-22 19:07:20 Last night Dana Loesch seemed sympathetic to the students and parents. Today she says,"Crying white mothers are ratings gold." To all the beautiful families in Parkland we will always support you. We need to keep fighting against the NRA and despicable comments like this.

7511 2018-02-22 19:07:02 Definitely! Every woman on the ice gave a golden performance, but only one team could take home the gold medals. Congratulations to Team USA. Team Canada, we are so proud of you! Look forward to doing it again in 4 years.
7512 2018-02-22 19:07:00 가엾군요. 당신，다른 자들을 앞지르려고만 하다보니 생각이 멀린처럼 되어버렸군요.

7520 2018-02-22 19:06:29 @DBADeborah Bronze, silver and gold are not easy to win, but the rigour of judging is what these awards so coveted and unique
7521 2018-02-22 19:06:28 Look at all you clowns bashing her! She has known for 4 years that she will either win a silver or a gold. There's no other outcome in womens hockey. If course she was distraught! In any other event I get it. Not in this one
7522 2018-02-22 19:06:28 John C Reilly is comedy gold.
7523 2018-02-22 19:06:25 Congratulations # 1 Gold medal Enjoy you all earned it USA
7524 2018-02-22 19:06:21 1/ I loved last nights game. Had goosebumps when US won, heart was beating crazy during OT and SO. Having said that, it’s a gold medal game
7525 2018-02-22 19:06:19 “I don’t need gold to show that I am golden”  Facts.
7526 2018-02-22 19:06:17 "All of the entire games" were not the gold medal game. The start times have and always will cater to the US audience. Oh, except hockey. But, we gotta see halfpipe freestyle slope whatever in primetime.
7527 2018-02-22 19:06:15 Congratulations!   #TeamUSA Bring Home The Gold! #Olympics

7543 2018-02-22 19:05:54 Kong arrives less conspicuously on the back of a magical cloud. What is less conspicuous is how he is dressed:

An outfit similar to a dōgi in golden orange hues bearing embroidery by thread that manages to capture the color of gold reflecting sunlight.

7544 2018-02-22 19:05:53 Silver means you lost gold. You don't win silver. These teams/players don't go to the Olympics to lose. She didn't insult anyone, she's emotional from losing something they've looked forward to for 4 years
7545 2018-02-22 19:05:52 My friend called my tumblr a “gold mine” so yeah it’s going to be a good day
7546 2018-02-22 19:05:46 Das ist erlaubt. Go for Gold! Du tust es stellvertretend für uns alle!

7553 2018-02-22 19:05:36 @HayesTSN it’s been tough lately for team Canada in shootouts. Women’s last night, team Canada men’s loss vs Czech 2018 olympics, world junior outdoor game vs USA 2017, Canada world championship 2017 final against Sweden, and world junior gold medal game loss against USA 2017
7554 2018-02-22 19:05:35 Team USA women’s hockey team wins Gold. Very tough game. Canada has nothing to be a shamed of they fought hard and played hard.
7555 2018-02-22 19:05:35 I saw this buzzfeed video where they had edible gold ice cream and I couldn't even handle that

7566 2018-02-22 19:05:17 I’m pretty sure that I would have had a panic attack if I watched the woman’s hockey gold medal match live. What an incredible game! 
7567 2018-02-22 19:05:14 Well nice you mention Radio Gold. This station which has risked everything to Champion the cause of the previous government, has a negligible internet presence, poor signal and no resources to do serious reportage. I’m sure you already know anyway.

7572 2018-02-22 19:05:08 I wouldn't dare not follow trump.I couldn't imagine missing out of some of the comedy gold that his "special" brain comes up with, like the global warming tweet
7573 2018-02-22 19:05:07 Yea, I've noticed that a lot of teams cry when they lose the gold medal game, including the US...
7574 2018-02-22 19:05:01 If the numbers aren't gold I will be even more upset.
7575 2018-02-22 19:05:00 @espn ..  why do you only have a 30 second segment on the usa women winning gold.. but if lebron farts that is their top story..

7590 2018-02-22 19:04:26 And mass shootings are "gold" for weapon manufacturers because people buy more guns after a mass shooting. Even the stocks of those companies went up. This is so reckless of her.
7591 2018-02-22 19:04:20 IOC screwed the world out of a classic...overtime should have settled the gold...shootout are luck based.
7592 2018-02-22 19:04:19 This is gold.
7593 2018-02-22 19:04:16 they are removing it gun by gun not all at once the scoped ar has no bloom anymore nether does the gold or purple scar

7596 2018-02-22 19:04:12 I actually will Loool, I been saying imma travel more this year
7597 2018-02-22 19:04:11 the fact that the WOMENS OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL GAME was decided in a shootout is a disgrace. Shootouts shouldnt even be a factor at all. Theyre rarely entertaining, and dont even remotely prove which team on the ice was the better team.
7598 2018-02-22 19:04:09 Totally agree, And that last sentence is gold. Well said.
7599 2018-02-22 19:04:08 The 75th medals awarded in the PyeongChang Olympics in Day 13 belongs to the ladies big air event:

#GOLD: Anna Gasser #SUI
#SILVER: Jamie Anderson #USA
#BRONZE: Zoi Sadowski Synnott #NZL
#snowboarding #PyeongChang2018
7600 2018-02-22 19:04:00 I think it will eventually, because it has been dead money for so long.    The Gold bugs who were bullish at 1900, 1800, 1700,  1600, 1500, (the whole way down) will then say "see, I told you gold would explode higher" when that finally occurs for real.   :)
7601 2018-02-22 19:03:56 Kno wutll b ratings gold .. being able to say there was a yr with 0 shootings in school concerts etc ..
7602 2018-02-22 19:03:55 It was an epic game! As a Canadian & avid sports fan, I can appreciate the US team's effort! They deserved the win! Congrats to th ladies, they played their heart out! Proud of our Canadian girls, they've rocked Gold for the longest time, we can take the Silver for once! Cheers!
7603 2018-02-22 19:03:46 How long before @jemelehill calls the all-Caucasian women's gold medal ice hockey team "white supremacists?"
7604 2018-02-22 19:03:43 I've clearly been talking a *wee* bit about hockey and the Olympics at work - all day people have been checking in with me about the gold medal game and saying congrats like I did anything other than cheer like a lunatic from my couch 
7605 2018-02-22 19:03:42 I should wear a track-suit, gold Italian horn pendant and cross. whenever he's calling anything.  I don't have hair, so I gotta resort to the Costanza look by default.
7606 2018-02-22 19:03:41 Reading more into the USA Women's Hockey Program, these women are true fucking heroes. Not only did they conquer adversity on the ice to take Gold last night, they conquered it off ice last year, receiving better pay and benefits equal to the USA men's hockey program.
7607 2018-02-22 19:03:37 It's not a waste of time though. Like I said in my example, the person got a bronze medal in the Olympics. That's a huge achievement. Do you think people compete in the Olympics with no intention of getting a gold medal? That's absurd.
7608 2018-02-22 19:03:36 Meanwhile Russian gold purchases have outweighed Chinese in the month of January continuing to add to their coffers while the petrodollar dies a slow death.
7609 2018-02-22 19:03:36 Nope; Gold-plated shit is still shit. A zebra can't change it's stripes, and liberals are always going to be vile children.

It's the main draw of their ideology: Selfishness.
7610 2018-02-22 19:03:35 "The media loves shootings because they're ratings gold."

Uh, news networks tend to cut off all commercials while covering breaking tragedies, so they, like, *lose* money when they happen.

Gold is made to be poisonous...  To degrade...  Planned obsolescence...

We have nothing to do with you...
7619 2018-02-22 19:03:08 Don’t forget she said it too  "Many in the media love mass shootings," @DLoesch tells the crowd at CPAC. "Crying white mothers are ratings gold."

7622 2018-02-22 19:03:02 Canadians are allergic to any hockey medal that isnt gold.
7623 2018-02-22 19:02:57 They have enough Gold Medals anyway.

7663 2018-02-22 19:01:33 I feel like Gold is more overused tbh.
7664 2018-02-22 19:01:29 I’d be surprised. Curling gold would still be an upset, and not seeing many other good chances. Maybe in speed skating.
7665 2018-02-22 19:01:28 Pretty prior to that , I guess everyone caught up with rebuilding themselves
7666 2018-02-22 19:01:21 Fell asleep in the 3rd....we get CBC here in Buffalo and they were running the replay in the morning. I was lucky enough to pick up where I fell asleep. Shoot out goal was filthy! #usa #Olympics #hockey #Gold how'd spin class go?

We invented hockey, both our men & women’s teams have won more gold than any other country in hockey history.Were good
7692 2018-02-22 19:00:21 The last time USA men’s took gold was the miracle on ice 40 years ago. 

USA Men’s is 2/24 for gold in Olympic hockey lifetime vs the women who are 2/6

7699 2018-02-22 19:00:04 Yes -- but one of the weaker gold stock charts.   What's needed is a sell off with a  BIG volume spike and bad news to come out.  Then perhaps we could see a meaningful bottom.

7706 2018-02-22 18:59:43 Congratulations to the US Team winning Gold.  I guess we (Canada) can't win Gold all the time....although we sure do a good job at it, LOL
7707 2018-02-22 18:59:43 I’d love to see everyone’s response if Vonn Had done the same thing with her bronze medal. Bet the responses would be about how bad a sport she was and being ungrateful. I remember a gymnast gif about a smirk on her face when she didn’t win gold.
7708 2018-02-22 18:59:40 gold exploration is not conflict of interest.  "climate industry" - of course, it is. There's lots of money spent on it - far more than on gold exploration to my eye.

7736 2018-02-22 18:58:55 Mmhmm, it does. The gold medals aren't pure gold though, so biting on them doesn't really do anything besides damaging your teeth if you bite down too hard.
7737 2018-02-22 18:58:54 Yea, Hudson turned out to be a poor signing. But they just turned it into something useful. Look NH went about 3 yrs where everything he touched turned to gold. Then it didn’t. But w limited payroll you can’t afford to make any mistakes. That’s the problem.

7739 2018-02-22 18:58:47 @WHockeytownUSA @GigiMarvin @MarvinWindows huge congratulations to gigi and team USA in the gold medal!!! Also awesome job getting the first goal in the shootout even after almost losing the puck!
7740 2018-02-22 18:58:47 Tbh not over the Canadian Women hockey team’s first Olympic gold medal loss in my lifetime #Pyeongyang2018
7741 2018-02-22 18:58:44 They will be invited to the White House with all the other medal winners to have the privilege of thanking him for the opportunity to vote for him. However, only the gold medal winners need to hand their medals over. "Silver & bronze are for losers. I like winners."

7744 2018-02-22 18:58:41 Everyone knows about the 2x world Stanley Cup champion @PKessel81, but do you know about the American hero @AmandaKessel8 which helped win the gold against Canada? #teamusa #USAvsCAN #GoldMedalGame
7745 2018-02-22 18:58:38 Estoy viendo Gold de Chet Faker y me dieron unas ganas impresionantes de ir a patinar.
7746 2018-02-22 18:58:37 yup. 

sue mertz (western and ghs) won the gold medal in Nagano in 1998, the last time that the US women won gold. (But i beat her ass in the shuttle run :-)

The women almost had to boycott the world champions last year because they were getting paid shit.
7747 2018-02-22 18:58:36 These Canadian teams spend 4 yrs preparing for this moment. And the top ones have every tool at their disposal. Two members of the men’s team are gold medalists with international experience coming out their ying yang.
7748 2018-02-22 18:58:36 Have a great day. Go with reason.

7750 2018-02-22 18:58:30 If that #womenshockey gold medal hockey game had gone another period of 4 on 4 overtime, Canada was not going to win. They were dominated by speed and lucky to get to a shootout. They need to get faster to compete with USA on international ice. #PyeongChang2018
7751 2018-02-22 18:58:28 Curling is not just another beer drinking sport! After defeating those lousy Canucks twice, this is about Gold baby!
7752 2018-02-22 18:58:27 Yellow gold or white gold???? Help
7753 2018-02-22 18:58:27 Geilo! Heute gab es ja auch wieder Olympia-Gold!
7754 2018-02-22 18:58:27 Not tired at all with only four hours of sleep. I think it’s the adrenaline from watching the @usahockey women win the gold!!!

7759 2018-02-22 18:58:18 @TeamShuster from 2-4 to the gold medal game? Unbelievable. Love the fight in this team, can’t wait to watch you guys finish it off against Sweden!

7761 2018-02-22 18:58:15 "Hard Road to Gold" is a book I'd like to read one day.
7762 2018-02-22 18:58:15 I would reject a claim that we couldn’t confirm yes. 

Why accept some conclusion that you haven’t confirmed? Can you explain why you do that?
7763 2018-02-22 18:58:15 It'll explode eventually, with or without talking gold bugs ;)

7768 2018-02-22 18:58:11 Have you noticed that your political sponsor Russia does not have any gold medals? Winning without cheating or doping is not easy. Please remind your boss Putin about that.
7769 2018-02-22 18:58:07 She needs to because wow 
7770 2018-02-22 18:58:06 Is it just me or do I see that stupid "666" again. They are literally laughing in our faces and mocking us.
7771 2018-02-22 18:58:05 So, you actually had to be watching The Golf Channel to get the info?  With The Olympics on-air?  With The Classic Women's Gold Medal Hockey game on-air?  smh

7773 2018-02-22 18:58:02 I almost threw my bronze medal in the trash, they know that silver is for the loser.  When you expect gold, that silver really hurts. 
7774 2018-02-22 18:57:56 The pricing on instrument cables is the biggest load of crock. ‘Ah yes the mogami gold 10 inch cable. 45 dollars. Good price’.
7775 2018-02-22 18:57:56 A heart of gold but it lost it's pride.
7776 2018-02-22 18:57:55 There is legit research that shows that Silver is the hardest to accept. 
Gold - You’re #1
Bronze - You’re happy to have placed 
Silver... I was almost #1. 

Regardless it displayed poor sportsmanship to the young people who look up to her

7781 2018-02-22 18:57:53 i hope sweden wins the gold like wtf
7782 2018-02-22 18:57:50 What an offensive human being you are Dana.  "Crying white mothers are ratings gold.”  Your heart is filled with hatred Dana & Your veins filled with sawdust. Conservatives have lost their minds & souls.  There is nothing left but darkness for you Dana, and KARMA.
7783 2018-02-22 18:57:50 I haven't checked the schedule yet, but @NBCOlympics better be showing the gold medal curling match on NBC proper for us cheap skates who don't pony up for a cable package. You owe it to @Shoostie2010! #teamusa #curling
7784 2018-02-22 18:57:49 Marketing is about storytelling. 2018 USA Olympic medalists now include TWINS @moniquelam7 · @JocelyneUSA17 (hockey gold), SIBLINGS @AlexShibutani @MaiaShibutani (bronze, ice dancing) and a MOM @kikkanimal (gold, x-country skiing).
7785 2018-02-22 18:57:49 The gold ole days  if guns were the problem we would have had mass shootings all throughout the history of our country but we didnot we only had them in recent past. What changed. Guns didnot change but the morality and security that was developed in nuclear families  did.
7786 2018-02-22 18:57:46 Hey @BethanyRTeeth I have still not gotten a code for my Double Gold RTX ticket. I have contacted FrontGate and they said they do not deal with any codes. Help!

7791 2018-02-22 18:57:39 I guess the US was due for a Gold. Congratulations to both the US and Canada on a great game, an extremely close game.

7797 2018-02-22 18:57:29 nah-bc her opinion of gold is largely irrelevant compared to its' use as a currency hedge, store of value for ppl of all ages, etc etc etc. its' user base is much bigger, and isn't made up of ppl like her.

Whereas Snap? its' base is smaller-and made up of other wannabe Kylies 
7798 2018-02-22 18:57:27 The last time USA men’s took gold was the miracle on ice 40 years ago. 

USA Men’s is 2/24 for gold in Olympic hockey lifetime vs the women who are 2/6 lifetime.

7804 2018-02-22 18:57:16 I gave you the answers - I explained how setting an objective for morality is a means of judging subjective circumstances and the moral path.

I even appraised how the objective of pleasing a god is too vague to define clearly what moral path to follow.
7805 2018-02-22 18:57:15 This is gold
7806 2018-02-22 18:57:13 @EASPORTSFIFA I will repeat this yet again until it is fixed!! UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE EVER ON ANY DIFFICULTY SHOULD A BRONZE PLAYER OUT PACE 94 PACE PLAYERS, OUT BODY 90 PHYSICAL PLAYERS, OR BE ANY MATCH TO ANY GOLD CARD EVER!! FIX IT!!!
7807 2018-02-22 18:57:13 A handful of Russian tweeters (allegedly) posting about both Trump and Hillary while hundreds of thousands from every Western country on the planet doing the same thing and the RUSSIANS affected the election outcome? This is beyond ridiculous. Beyond laughable. Beyond stupid.
7808 2018-02-22 18:57:10 As a Canadian congratulations to team USA women’s hockey on Olympic gold.  You’ve been at the top for a couple years now.  Well deserved.  Proud of team Canada as well.

7811 2018-02-22 18:57:04 Get ‘em, Brett. Nothing matters to these people except money. In psychology, what she said is called projection. Replace “ratings gold” with, well, gold - and you understand her mind.
7812 2018-02-22 18:57:01 A Gold Medal Hockey game should not go to shootout. Not the way to settle that. Should be a straight OT like the NHL does in the playoffs. Glad USA girls came out on top last night but that's not the way that should be settled.

7823 2018-02-22 18:56:22 Proud American here and see zero issue with this. You play for Gold and settle for nothing less.
7824 2018-02-22 18:56:22 This wasn't a problem before and we got gold. Can we just realize the rest of the world is getting better and we must adapt and get better?

7829 2018-02-22 18:56:13 Watch Keri Strug who had a bad ankle injury and still did a vault and win gold!  That's determination. Sometimes you have to fight through the pain.
7830 2018-02-22 18:56:13 I agree it isn’t helpful.  But what she said today was unreal.  She said the legacy media loves school shootings because crying white mothers is ratings gold.  Seriously.  She said that

So I found a necklace, my ex gave me & my genius self said wow look at that it’s gold I could sell it! I’m all excited now because recently the price of gold went up, so I’m thinking I can spoil myself 
7833 2018-02-22 18:56:02 My proposal doesn't hinge on a crisis for its utility in helping people replicate & extend others' work.

The idea is modeled on the clinical trial literature. Protocol descriptions used to be a paper a few pages long. New gold standard is "submit the PDF of the actual protocol."
7834 2018-02-22 18:56:02 i don’t care if you’re 6yrs old or 60yrs old... there is no need to be rude to me bc my heart is made of gold so fuck u

7837 2018-02-22 18:55:55 Zero speed, feet almost always flat when receiving or handling puck...pure dump and chase foolishness that lost them puck control pretty much every time...couldn't really recall seeing more than a handful of offensive zone faceoffs...just had a bad game, too bad it was for gold.
7838 2018-02-22 18:55:46 A great 24 hours. US Women hockey wins gold. US Men's curling in the gold medal game. Black Dress released and cleansed my soul.
7839 2018-02-22 18:55:42 I wouldn’t care. A hug from you would be like winning the gold medal 
7840 2018-02-22 18:55:42 Why didn’t they make the YouTube logo the same shade of gold omg I’m mad.
7841 2018-02-22 18:55:37 wtf you using 12 million gold on

7848 2018-02-22 18:55:25 Personally, I feel like this would look better on red or blue. Or black or white. Basically anything but that tan/gold. Otherwise, I like it.

7852 2018-02-22 18:55:12 Can you just release all this please? I practically cried listening to the ending, and the rest was absolutely gold. It’s a sample pack demo track and you made it sound like an incredible EP preview. Genius.

7860 2018-02-22 18:54:52 LOL Bret raging in the chat last night was gold.
7861 2018-02-22 18:54:41 Last year, the Women's USA Hockey team fought and won for fair wages. Today, they are Olympic Gold Winners! #TeamUSA — feeling pumped
7862 2018-02-22 18:54:39 Ilhota ta gold!! 
7863 2018-02-22 18:54:31 A lot of people are talking about this angry blue hedgehog running around and taking gold rings. NOT NICE. Obama didn’t try to stop it, and Crooked Hillary wanted those rings for herself. ENOUGH!
7864 2018-02-22 18:54:26 My sentiment applies in general, not specifically to this (I know my bias). A shootout to determine a gold medal game? Meh. 

Also: BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
7865 2018-02-22 18:54:21 She's just really upset because once again a Kessel got the gold...
7866 2018-02-22 18:54:21 True but suppose she tweeted something to the effect that she didn't know when last she wore gold. Do you think the price of gold would even budge? Fickle markets..
7867 2018-02-22 18:54:20 Imagine losing the gold medal in a shootout. Shootouts are dumb because it just voids all your hard play. Busting your ass on the ice just to have a near coin toss decide the outcome has got to be depressing for the losing side.
7868 2018-02-22 18:54:19 Twitter gold
7869 2018-02-22 18:54:19 Like Barack Obama who has been called America's No. 1 gun salesman, CNN, MSNBC, and other media's ham-handed & hyperbolic anti-2nd Amendment propagandizing is fundraising gold for the NRA and political manna from heaven for Donald Trump.
7870 2018-02-22 18:54:18 hand he could see the smallest traces of gold specks, mostly likely from the hook having to breach his thick armor. His eyes glanced to the hourglass, two thirds empty. Time was winding down and it wasn't looking good for Zero. Win or lose he had to use a more drastic option.-
7871 2018-02-22 18:54:14 Just found out US Women's hockey won gold! From what I read and saw the game and shootout looked amazing. Pretty sure I saw that NBCSN will replay at 4pm
7872 2018-02-22 18:54:12 20 since the US women just won gold after 20 years! 
7873 2018-02-22 18:54:11 I agree, I'd be pissed to lose too.  Those ladies dedicate their entire lives to win gold.
7874 2018-02-22 18:54:10 Nice! Love the warm yellow, orange, gold, and brown sky over the dark hills! Thanks!! :-)
7875 2018-02-22 18:54:09 A man with a heart of gold, turned a year wiser today . His patience & abundance of love for his kids - my kinda inspiration 
7876 2018-02-22 18:54:08 Gold-bugs need to STFU if they want Gold to ever rally for real.  :)
7877 2018-02-22 18:54:06 Even in the men’s tourney, once you’re in the gold medal game it becomes winning or losing gold. It’s impossible to be happy in that moment. It’d be like giving Brady the AFC champ trophy after he just lost the super bowl
7878 2018-02-22 18:54:03 I really liked Chespin lol it was my first game after being out of Pokémon since Gold/Silver

7883 2018-02-22 18:53:32 Eso si, prefiero un troll k se divierta en un game a un tio ego player prepotente k se crea dios y este en gold

Los dos molestan pero uno me molesta mas que los dos.
7884 2018-02-22 18:53:32 Recent CNBC & BBG articles re. PetroYuan oil contract make ZERO mention of Yuan to physical gold convertibility @ ShanghaiGoldExch-Int.

7886 2018-02-22 18:53:27 i wish cheritz couldve distanced themselves from their fantasy roots for a second and made mint eye a lil more realistic setting. like a decrepit abandoned house would be fine bc why would rika rob her followers blind just to put gold leaf trim on the walls

7899 2018-02-22 18:53:09 Finally watching the end of the women's hockey gold medal game. HOLY CRAP. 
7900 2018-02-22 18:53:08 As a general rule, washing w/soap & water following the CDC guideline of wetting hands w/water, then lathering hands including in between fingers & under nails x 20+sec is the gold std. Hand sanitizer is not bad tho and better than not washing!
7901 2018-02-22 18:53:06 Japan made history and won gold and silver in male figure skating in the #WinterOlympics. If somebody says with a straight face that #NaganoWinterOlympics98ForNintendo64 didn't inspire them, let me tell you you're lying to yourself.
7902 2018-02-22 18:53:05 Hey @freddealmqvist ! It’s the USA  vs. Sweden  for the Gold Medal  in Men’s Curling ! Who you got?!?! #USA #USA
7903 2018-02-22 18:53:03 Bonuses for armed teachers! An additional 20 gold if they bring us the ears of their enemies!
7904 2018-02-22 18:53:01 It certainly doesn't look good on camera, but it shows how disappointing she is. She is not disrespecting USA. She just showing real emotions where for Canada,it's gold or nothing in women hockey
7905 2018-02-22 18:53:00 Nevermiiiind only the gold passes are available right now. 
7906 2018-02-22 18:53:00 shoot out is fine in preliminary rounds. But if you’re playing for a medal you need to play hockey. Not have a goaltending contest for gold.

7909 2018-02-22 18:52:52 There's 2 types of canadians today 1. Extremely tired/mad that stayed up to watch the game 2. Well rested/confused how canada didnt win gold.
7910 2018-02-22 18:52:52 First, women's hockey, now men's curling. USA does it to Canada AGAIN!... Old Glory wins semi, 5-3, and will play SWE for the gold as American resurgence continues with Winter Games winding down. USA men won bronze in '06, but nothing since...
7911 2018-02-22 18:52:50 まって………………超絶かわいい………………
7912 2018-02-22 18:52:48 Go for the GOLD! You could WIN a TEAM USA Prize Pack. It's so easy to play. Enter now! #bitetowinsweepstakes
7913 2018-02-22 18:52:40 Women's gold medal came, vs Canada last night, shows what sports can be when there is passion, grit. skill and not played by millionaire pro athletes bored to tears 95% of the time and who couldn't really care less if they win or lose other than maybe the championship round.
7914 2018-02-22 18:52:36 Well i didn’t really cause I was too heartbroken over Canada losing in the Gold medal game vs the States last night 
7915 2018-02-22 18:52:36 We just got some new *Gold Mountain F1-OG*
7916 2018-02-22 18:52:35 USA men's #curling went from 2-4 to winning 4 straight, now playing for the gold against Sweden. Kinda impressive. #PyeongChang2018

7919 2018-02-22 18:52:29 I think Microsoft could do something like this:
- Multiplayer online: 12 dollars per year
- Games with gold:  50 dollars per year
- Game Pass: 120 dollars per year

Like, I don't think they will make multiplayer for free, but at least let us choose what services we want to have.

7922 2018-02-22 18:52:15 Season 3 was...not what the show should have been. I get it, they were worried about getting cancelled and one of the actresses got pregnant in the season prior so they wrote her off. Kind of a mess, but still. Seasons 1 and 2 (esp. season 1) are gold.
7923 2018-02-22 18:52:15 “Wow fools gold is such a sad song if you think about it” bruh I’ve been LIVING that song so don’t tell me how sad it must feel
7924 2018-02-22 18:52:13 You've won GOLD in our hearts, @council_band 
7925 2018-02-22 18:52:11 Yea tell them get gone. I’m coming tomorrow to get my new phone tell them hold that i phone 8 plus gold for me

7929 2018-02-22 18:52:06 Womens hockey gold medal match. One of the best hockey games I’ve ever seen!
7930 2018-02-22 18:52:06 Silver is the worst of the medals to “win”.

Bronze means you’re happy to get a medal.
Gold means you are THE champ.
Silver is the runner up, thanks for trying medal.
7931 2018-02-22 18:52:04 The Gladiators host Mariner HS tonight at 7:00 PM in 6A Regional Quarter-Finals.  Everyone come out in your blue and gold and support the Gladiators.

7940 2018-02-22 18:51:44 US has 8 golds and only has 2 realistically possible gold medals left- curling and Mantia in the mass start. I would bet against both, so I'd say you are 99.8% safe.

7954 2018-02-22 18:51:24 No wonder they lost hockey gold.

7957 2018-02-22 18:51:16 You have changed your stance. You said nobody celebrates 2nd place. I showed you why you're wrong. You then built a strawman because you couldn't actually debate me. And yes, they were bad sports. You don't lose for silver. You win to get to silver. Then win again for gold.
7958 2018-02-22 18:51:12 Congratulations to #USWomensHockey for the Gold Medal! A to Z is going gold too as we celebrate our 50th anniversary in 2018. #CelebrateInStyle
7959 2018-02-22 18:51:08 It’s unsportsmanlike. Yes, you are the first “loser” but the person who got gold beat you fair and square. You can be upset you didn’t win gold, I’d be too, but a little respect for your opponent who won goes a long way.
7960 2018-02-22 18:51:05 #CanadianWomensHockeyTeam you are gold in our hearts! @HC_Women #TeamCanada #PyeongChang2018

7963 2018-02-22 18:50:56 All right that clinches it. @Phil_Sports is my favorite anchor in the history of SportsCenter. Would Dan Patrick have ever chanted “Go green, go gold, fight fight fight”? Don’t think so. Way to rep Mason, Phil. 
7964 2018-02-22 18:50:49 Meistens ja nicht, aber heute is echt einiges an comedy gold dabei 
7965 2018-02-22 18:50:48 Actually it's ratings gold for the NRA. Gun Sales always spike when they whip up the false "they're coming for your guns" narrative after every shooting.
7966 2018-02-22 18:50:47 @KDTrey5 Hey Mr.Durant, would you please recommend where to buy size 16 plus extra wide socks? I can’t find socks to fit my 14 y/o son.  Gold toe was my go to but now their biggest size is too small!
7967 2018-02-22 18:50:42 While relatively few watched it, women's gold medal hockey game last night where we beat Canada who dominated last 4 Olympics was scintillating. Came down the the last do-or die of shootout. Not as good as Orlando vs Sacramento in March of course, but we'll take what we can get.
7968 2018-02-22 18:50:42 Looks like the #NRA response to another school shooting is to blame the media for reporting on them claiming “many in the media love mass shootings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold”. Talking points also include media hates NRA. FBI bad. #Disgusting
7969 2018-02-22 18:50:38 Shows love and emotion for what happened, I bet she feels they let Canada lose, it is not about a single player, she was upset, emotional, if they won gold they would be treated like heros, no matter the medal colour, I am still proud of the Women's team @HC_Women
7970 2018-02-22 18:50:36 When the fed begins to reverse their policy on interest rates, that could make gold go balsitic
7971 2018-02-22 18:50:29 I bet they’ve crossed paths with Brandon at the rink. #usahockey #gold
7972 2018-02-22 18:50:29 #SchoolShooting Finally a @POTUS who listens, uses common sense, will advocate teachers be armed, remove gun free zones, harden our schools once and for all. Our children are more important than the money or gold in all our banks so why not start protecting them accordingly
7973 2018-02-22 18:50:29 #USWomensHockey #Olympics GOLD
7974 2018-02-22 18:50:25 If Dana is so brave, why didn’t she tell the audience last night that the media loves mass shootings? That crying white mothers are ratings gold. 
Instead she slinked away like a rat.
7975 2018-02-22 18:50:22 #Gold ;) great game, could have gone either way
7976 2018-02-22 18:50:20 US Woman's Hockey wins Gold. What a great achievement. A heartbreaking loss for Canada, but I hope the ladies to our north know we are incredibly proud of them too. Also, I never expect you to lose again... Canadian Pride
7977 2018-02-22 18:50:18 + this photo is gold !! Your hair looks very vibrant I love it !!!
7978 2018-02-22 18:50:17 Oh, man, I just thought of a plot for #JohnWick 3. After being on the run, he goes underground and works as a teacher but then, nothing happens as he quietly goes about his business and becomes a beloved figure at the school and eases into retirement with a stack of gold coins.
7979 2018-02-22 18:50:17 O line-up do Games With Gold de março foi o pior que já ví, contando Gold e PSPlus. E olha que na Plus teve uns meses que era melhor ter vindo um voucher de 1 dolar na carteira da PSN.
7980 2018-02-22 18:50:15 Old but gold
7981 2018-02-22 18:50:13 Thank You, US Olympic Women's Hockey Team. 
Finally-- the media is actually has something positive to talk about
(Oh?! & the US has a men's curling team that won gold?..)
7982 2018-02-22 18:50:13 I get it like she’s mad about not getting gold. It’s just not a good look for Canada
7983 2018-02-22 18:50:13 Congrats to the women's @usahockey team on their gold medal win. Were the better team all game & deserved it. Canada thought that cause they've won 4 straight all they had to do was show up & boom, 5 in a row. Hunger & urgency were not there & the price was paid #PeyongChang2018
7984 2018-02-22 18:50:11 Spinach Chard is rarer than freakig gold  I just wanna make my comfort soup dammit
7985 2018-02-22 18:50:10 And not cuz we skate fast, cuz we beat canada in their sport for the gold for the first time since me, you, and @drum_killer met.... literally
7986 2018-02-22 18:50:08 Now that I've seen both of LAFC's kits I feel better about our boring away kit. Yeesh, they wasted the opportunity to really have a dope black and gold kit.
7987 2018-02-22 18:50:05 Give her a break. Her team was going for a record 5th gold, she and her teammates played their hearts out and this was simply a “in the moment” reaction. All good.
7988 2018-02-22 18:50:04 "Petro Gold" can only be characterized as "Platinum Bullshit."

7991 2018-02-22 18:50:00 "Like lannisters shit gold" OMG  haha idk like, when you see comments like that it's kinda like "thank you... I guess...?"
7992 2018-02-22 18:49:59 Jennifer Jones and her team went undefeated to win Gold at the last Olympics, a record that can be tied but never broken. She should have been an automatic choice to go to this Olympics and defend her title. A no brainer! @curlingcanada @cbcolympics, @jjonescurl
7993 2018-02-22 18:49:57 I mean when u get gold 3 what do you expect
7994 2018-02-22 18:49:53 Well let’s hope the #Gold #hunt goes good, Steak  dinner coming up !
7995 2018-02-22 18:49:53 Sorry bud I need type properly.On this Roman site 
The Euro ace would not function I was using the Nokta
Found 2 denari..following week Tom the Garrett lad got rid..he has since found lots of good stuff including a nice medievil gold ring.
7996 2018-02-22 18:49:52 Obviously never saw you play Jim. If he had, you’d have a gold plated one. Remember you against my team @WTrinityRL in 1975 semi at Odsal. We were favourites but you and Widnes had a blinder. You are forgiven.
7997 2018-02-22 18:49:48 @BillSpadea If stupidity were an Olympic sprt, you'd win the gold. The Fla. students r brave enough to do wht the cowardly adults did not.
7998 2018-02-22 18:49:47 Thats alright. I think he was playing with fools gold. He lacks arm strength big time...
7999 2018-02-22 18:49:46 @RSherman_25 red & gold, follow ur dreams, send a example to the world
8000 2018-02-22 18:49:44 Kind of want those gold rims in my life. I mean they wouldn't work on my car, but on a Subie...perfect.
8001 2018-02-22 18:49:42 Just compared The Treasure of the Sierra Madre to City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly’s Gold and now my husband isn’t speaking to me

8003 2018-02-22 18:49:39 Today has been a good day! Woke up to hear the USA  WON GOLD in !  @usahockey Left work early because of the  now just waiting for the @NMStateMBB game this evening!   #USA #nmstate #Aggies
8004 2018-02-22 18:49:33 Silver is a life assurance, don’t call it an investment + there is less silver in the world than gold + Silver is in every tech device
8005 2018-02-22 18:49:33 Why does a green pump do 225 to the face but a gold rocket launcher just 175
8006 2018-02-22 18:49:27 Was 45's "qwik tips" note yesterday typical of Ivanka's management style? I want to see some more of her work:
"Daddy, don't wear the gold diapers under the white golf pants."
"Daddy, use your #SAD face when you talk to school kids."
"Daddy, tiny hands to yourself."
8007 2018-02-22 18:49:23 The recap of this chat will be amazing @MadalynSklar - so much gold in here today #twittersmarter
8008 2018-02-22 18:49:16 U.S. women at the 2018 Winter Olympics is the real story. They've won 75% of the gold medals and 71% of the total medals so far.  I can’t help but wonder over the balance of media coverage or who will be offered endorsements.
8009 2018-02-22 18:49:15 Congratulations to @usahockey Women's team for winning gold! But the shootout has no place in the Olympics.
8010 2018-02-22 18:49:15 No it is not, That does not show anything but disrespect to Canada and her team mates. Silver is right below Gold. I hate to see what she would have done with bronze.I hope the disqualify her
8011 2018-02-22 18:49:14 does anyone still have the login  also we can probably even keep some of the old birdboy vines they were gold
8012 2018-02-22 18:49:12 congratulations USA hockey on your gold!
8013 2018-02-22 18:49:12 Betting against $GOLD is the same as betting for governments. He who bets on governments and government money bets against 6,000 years of recorded human history - Gary North
8014 2018-02-22 18:49:08 On behalf of an entire world, CONGRATULATIONS to the U.S. president on winning the GOLD for an embarrassment to the human race!
8015 2018-02-22 18:49:07 I think her mistake was taking the medal off while the camera was on her. Clearly, she accepted it. But removed it immediately.

And yes, the gold medal final in Munich was a travesty, and those medals sit in a vault to this day.
8016 2018-02-22 18:49:05 I ain't saying she a Gold Digger
But she a fucking wit no Broke Nigga
8017 2018-02-22 18:49:03 Lol this is gold
8018 2018-02-22 18:49:03 Difference is Ed in bronze medal game you have to win to earn bronze. Canada lost gold and settled for silver.
8019 2018-02-22 18:49:01 @lindseyvonn CONGRATS Lindsey! Whether you decide to return or not, you're truly a Champion, not to mention a survivor from a terrible accident-injury. I was wishing Gold for your last run. Just being there is as special as it gets! Congrats again from the Seattle area.
8020 2018-02-22 18:48:59 I concur. We don’t hear a lot from him, but when we do it’s always pure gold.
8021 2018-02-22 18:48:57 Yo I might have to cops some gold's like Killmonger, they were dope af

8024 2018-02-22 18:48:50 Sure, I am still waiting for Jim "gas bag" Rickards "gold $10,000" nonsense to come true.
8025 2018-02-22 18:48:49 South is good. Diamonds n gold in Transvaal, girls in Brazil.
8026 2018-02-22 18:48:48 We ain’t taking no shit but great pics and fits you can’t afford it’s a greater expense. Canary stones glow gold like the shade of the piss.
8027 2018-02-22 18:48:46 @AjKFAN since you have the answers that pertain to @TeamShuster when is the gold medal match and is it on tv live!
8028 2018-02-22 18:48:45 I’ve been reading “Digital Gold” by Nathaniel Popper.   It’s a great read about #Bitcoin’s early days and mystery of #SatoshiNakamoto.  

Highly recommended to anyone with real interest in #cryptocurrency!

I don’t think we’ll ever learn who Satoshi was, but he was 100% genius.
8029 2018-02-22 18:48:43 Congrats on a great game and win for Gold. 2 great teams with amazing athletes who equally played their hearts out. I can understand your excitement. Gotta love hockey! 
8030 2018-02-22 18:48:37 SO MUCH FAKE GOLD LEAF TO REMOVE.
8031 2018-02-22 18:48:37 Hey, @wyshynski ‘s prediction came true. #TeamUSA won #Gold when he wasn’t there. Sorry, I think you’re banned from all future games.
8032 2018-02-22 18:48:36 Haha! Comedy gold.
8033 2018-02-22 18:48:33 I don’t understand how folks don’t like Kendrick’s verse on the Mask Off rmx. It is GOLD!!
8034 2018-02-22 18:48:33 Seriously @MeghanMcCain your NRA pal is acting like she doesn't know she's going to PRISON. Dana prefers to taunt while parents bury their dead teens.-->"Many in legacy media love mass shootings. You guys love it... Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you" UGH! Shut her up!
8035 2018-02-22 18:48:32 .@AmandaKessel8 Now need to change your profile to Olympic GOLD Medalist
8036 2018-02-22 18:48:29 @Shoostie2010 and his team are welcomed at UPMC Park to throw out a ceremonial first pitch and get the gold medal treatment any time.
8037 2018-02-22 18:48:24 Like sure I’d love stuff to be over in dlp from WDW like mickey waffles and rose gold stuff but doesn’t mean I dislike DLP at all. Being that negative when they haven’t even been is shocking.
8038 2018-02-22 18:48:21 Add gold medalist to your profile. 
8039 2018-02-22 18:48:20 @BurgerKingUK my daughter got a gold Mr crabs in her kids meal does this anything???

8048 2018-02-22 18:48:10 Women's Hockey - In the last 2 Olympics, the U.S. looked like the more skilled team but Canada had the clutch factor like the Patriots. It took a SO to buck that. Gold is gold, but it's gotta feel like there's an asterisk beside it for U.S.
8049 2018-02-22 18:48:10 I just thought about an impromptu speech I had to give to the senior class & it was the last time they ever didn’t give me a heads up. I ended by saying, “& ladies, lets try not to get pregnant”. Thank God for growth & a filter. The shock & humor on the faces of admin was gold.

8058 2018-02-22 18:47:42 The terrorists armed very well. Every day, they use millions of dollars worth of ammunition. They probably have a gold MasterCard.
8059 2018-02-22 18:47:39 Indubitably so. Terrific women's gold medal game last night,
8060 2018-02-22 18:47:38 As I'm broke like this, I've been listening to "money" by Adekunle Gold and hoping for a miracle. 
Moneyyyyyyy ehhh
8061 2018-02-22 18:47:38 Just waiting @DFImpressionist for your take on the Harry Kane at the Brits last night, surely comedy gold ?
8062 2018-02-22 18:47:28 Me having my mama beside me feels better than having a gold or silver
8063 2018-02-22 18:47:28 When you think you're getting good at @PlayOverwatch but they keep changing the game. Went from diamond to gold in less then 2 weeks ... thanks great balancing guys.
8064 2018-02-22 18:47:23 In team sports, you win gold, and you win bronze... if you lose, you get silver.
8065 2018-02-22 18:47:22 In 2018 facts will become opinions. Got it. And of course your opinion is obviously consequential, right? Gold star for you!
8066 2018-02-22 18:47:21 If Tinker Knight's machines aren't solid gold, what's even the point?
8067 2018-02-22 18:47:20 It doesn't matter...the fact that the Eagles are their gold standard is all that matters

8072 2018-02-22 18:47:06 Scored here!!  #HWHAP  makes me laugh so hard, no sound comes out. It's pure gold.

8075 2018-02-22 18:47:00 I wonder what the guy driving a gold plated AMG Mercedes around elephant and castle does for a living
8076 2018-02-22 18:46:57 I think I remember a head of a major network saying Trump's lies and divisiveness were ratings gold - bad for the country but great for the network's bottom line.
8077 2018-02-22 18:46:56 I don’t wanna hoe. I don’t wanna gold digger like we out in California.
8078 2018-02-22 18:46:52 And I guess that last 19 years? Since your ladies haven't posted a gold for 20. You were due, settle down lol

8086 2018-02-22 18:46:33 Hey @Meagan_McHugh, @ETNreisenweber suggested we have a party to watch the gold medal #curling game at 1:35 a.m. on Saturday. Thoughts? 
8087 2018-02-22 18:46:32 Any of you ladies got some advice on where to get some 24k gold hoops for my woman’s birthday?
8088 2018-02-22 18:46:31 I cancelled my Cow Chop Patron for awhile. I'll sub again eventually, but lately I haven't been that into their content, Youtube or Patron, so it was no longer worth it. Also my RT First payment is coming up right after my birthday and I plan on finally joining double gold.
8089 2018-02-22 18:46:30 Eric Clapton radio on Spotify is pure gold

8092 2018-02-22 18:46:26 I really need to get a gold nose hoop lol.
8093 2018-02-22 18:46:25 I'd tell them when the U.S. Senator starts respecting you, you should start respecting them.  Otherwise Fuck off.  Maybe tell your President to stop "ridiculing" gold star family, women, minority and disabled reporters.
8094 2018-02-22 18:46:24 Your organization demeans itself with shootouts. Gold medal game should ALWAYS be overtime until winner scored. 
8095 2018-02-22 18:46:23 YEA! Go TEAM USA Hockey, Women RULE! GOLD all the way.
Thank you for representin' and all the hard work. GO USA WOMEN TEAM HOCKEY!

8099 2018-02-22 18:46:18 Today we celebrate speed skater @ShaniDavis , the first African-American to win a gold medal in any Winter Olympic Games. #BlackHistoryMonth #Olympics
8100 2018-02-22 18:46:18 @DLoesch says crying white mothers are ratings gold. Oh dear, you didn't hear the white men at the NRA in the background saying , let's use a pretty white girl to push our agenda. It will soften the bullshit we peddle. You're a fucking  PAWN & a moron.
8101 2018-02-22 18:46:11 But the bottom line is that the GOLD is coming to the USA! WHERE IT BELONGS!
8102 2018-02-22 18:46:10 I've never felt more a part of an Olympic Gold Medal until the Women's Hockey team won Gold last night, made half the team's drinks at Starbucks. Big time contribution to the squad
8103 2018-02-22 18:46:10 JV Gold is cancelled too.
8104 2018-02-22 18:46:04 덤덤하게 헤어지고 세달뒤에 외로움에 사무쳐서 충동적으로 보쿠토 경기 보러간 아카아시 보고 싶다..사귈 적에 보쿠토가 경기 끝나고 팀원들이랑 자주 가는 식당 알고 있어서 아님 말고 심정으로 괜히 가게 근처에서 얼쩡거리는데 결국 잠깐 전화 받으러 나온 보쿠토랑 마주쳐 버리기
8105 2018-02-22 18:46:04 So happy for the women’s @usahockey team on FINALLY winning gold against Canada.
8106 2018-02-22 18:45:58 As the sportscasters, WHO'VE ACTUALLY BEEN IN THE OLYMPICS, said: "you don't win a silver, you lose the gold." These women work FOUR YEARS, relentlessly, to come in 2nd...I'd be pissed, too!! They're not thinking of YOUR KIDS in that moment! They're thinking of THEIR loss! Damn.
8107 2018-02-22 18:45:58 @DLoesch Did you really say that crying white mothers are ratings gold?
8108 2018-02-22 18:45:56 If all the gold sitting in the oceans and seas were mined, every person on this planet would get about 20 kilograms of gold each (according to one source it’s only 4 kg… but it’s still a lot).

8116 2018-02-22 18:45:36 Twitter gold! 
8117 2018-02-22 18:45:35 I think she's upset about the reffing, and prob the injustice of a gold medal decided by shootout, so wrong.
8118 2018-02-22 18:45:35 I read that so wrong
8119 2018-02-22 18:45:34 .@NRA spokeswoman @DLoesch to media @CPAC : "Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you and many of the legacy media in the back"
8120 2018-02-22 18:45:32 I get that USA's awesome shootout goal won them the Gold, but Canada's awesome goal a couple before was better. #USAvsCAN

8124 2018-02-22 18:45:27 @TODAYshow showed more of @hodakotb watching Olympic women win gold from stands this morning than actual game highlights. How embarrassing.

8127 2018-02-22 18:45:10 Had not watched a single second of Olympic coverage @Pallilo, but I stayed up and watched women's gold medal hockey game to the end.

8140 2018-02-22 18:44:36 I'm wondering if I'm the only one who thinks they saw the American player skate backwards at the start of her penalty shot in the gold medal game ? #USAvsCAN
8141 2018-02-22 18:44:35 @BBCSport @clarebalding @BorisJohnson
Absolutely mad stonage from @evemuirhead surely got to be gold for @TeamGB #muirheadmadness #icequeen #TeamGB #curling #goldblooded
8142 2018-02-22 18:44:31 He got DQ on that race lol. But team USA got silver!  Congrats to him and Hungary for winning the gold.
8143 2018-02-22 18:44:30 Gold going up is in direct conflict with rates going up. I’m definitely on the other side here ...Gold moves lower ...1250 before 1400
8144 2018-02-22 18:44:29 gOLD
8145 2018-02-22 18:44:23 Congrats to the U.S. Women's Hockey team for bringing home the gold! #USA
8146 2018-02-22 18:44:23 Last night at the gym there was a girl with big gold “Selena style” hoop earrings!! Why?!?!
8147 2018-02-22 18:44:22 So basically this girl is a fan of a high jump gold medalist. And the guy gets bedridden bc of an injury and he goes to an all boys school so this girl disguises herself as a boy and enrolls at the same school as him to help him.
8148 2018-02-22 18:44:21 1. Todd bought the land from Tony Beets so the gold you mined is his. 2. The Gold Rush Whitewater gold came through and todd was an investor. 3. The bet only counts what you mined, not what Rick mined. 4. It was Opposite Day when you made the bet but you didn’t know that.
8149 2018-02-22 18:44:21 Heck of a Hockey game ! Congrats USA Women's Hockey team on winning the Gold Medal!
8150 2018-02-22 18:44:21 In tandem with Tony Adams, they'd be pure GOLD  - just not at our club ... obviously.
8151 2018-02-22 18:44:20 And all that glitters is gold
8152 2018-02-22 18:44:19 Wow. Just dumbfpunded by this. I mean if stupid had an award. She wins gold most years.
8153 2018-02-22 18:44:18 Also OTL at those comments that go "sequel pls" -- what is subtlety and reverse psychology 

Idk do some people think you conjure fics out of thin air? Pull it out of a hat?? Shit fics like lannisters shit gold???
8154 2018-02-22 18:44:18 It is...but does that make them equal to the gold medal winner...no.

Why does not achieving the goal matter? Reaching for a truly unattainable goal is a waste of time when you could take your efforts and reach a goal that is. 

Once again....never be equal
8155 2018-02-22 18:44:18 How much does a good pair of gold fronts go for?
8156 2018-02-22 18:44:15 @sadqueer4life I followed you cause of this roundabout retweet, but your tweets are still gold. Get it girl!
8157 2018-02-22 18:44:14 @pou29 I’m a Canadian.Tell Jocelyn she embarrassed Canada.She behaved like a spoiled child and needs to grow the fuck up.
Truth is Canada was outplayed did not deserve the gold.

8166 2018-02-22 18:43:44 Used to trip over tin foil, now I see I’m standing in fields of gold.
8167 2018-02-22 18:43:41 That kind of comment makes YOU laughable.
8168 2018-02-22 18:43:40 If you think I’m not watching @usacurl gold medal match Saturday after midnight you’re insane  it’s a precursor for what’s to come in 2030 with me, @Jww320, and @GMOConnor
8169 2018-02-22 18:43:38 "we needed to provide the spades to the gold-diggers ..." @jessbutcher on the evolution of @blippar and the #AR ecosystem @StartupGrind

8198 2018-02-22 18:42:19 Happy for Team USA Women's Hockey but god is it the dumbest thing ever deciding a friggin gold medal over a shootout.
8199 2018-02-22 18:42:19 Hopefully for you and saints nation.  Drew Bree’s has as many Super bowl wins and MVPs as Nick Foles does ... one will have a gold jacket
8200 2018-02-22 18:42:17 Congratulations to the winners and to the canadian team for the silver medal achievement..... We are proud that you are bringing again the gold and silver to the american continent.... Una vez más fueron mejores que las europeas y asiáticas. Cheers!!!

8208 2018-02-22 18:41:42 CANADA USED TO BE THE UNDISPUTED SUPERPOWER IN HOCKEY. BUT LATELY THEY SEEM LIKE A BUNCH OF LAZY ENTITLED SPOILED BRATS WITH THE ATTITUDE "WE'RE #1...NOW GIVE US OUR GOLD MEDAL". THAT AIN'T HOW IT WORKS...THEY HAVE TO EARN IT BY HARD WORK...NOT THE REPUTATION OF THOSE BEFORE THEM
8209 2018-02-22 18:41:39 My friend. I've watched every heart breaking game since these guys were wearing short shorts. That said your video breakdowns are gold. Keep'em coming. A definite focus on the play of Frank, Mudiay & Burke. Definitely on the PNR defense & 3pt line defense.
8210 2018-02-22 18:41:38 I would support an alternate feed of various sporting events called by Terry-Tara-Johnny. College football? NASCAR? Gold.
8211 2018-02-22 18:41:37 Get R Done.   The Black Gold is a great smoke.
8212 2018-02-22 18:41:35 Gee whiz Daniel; can't we come together as a country for two seconds over the gold? Gee whiz Bro!

8217 2018-02-22 18:41:28 Come here. We don't have much, but we did beat Canada for the gold medal last night and I think that's a good enough reason.
8218 2018-02-22 18:41:17 Setting an alarm to wake up to see @TeamShuster go for gold! #usa #PyeongChang2018
8219 2018-02-22 18:41:16 I think that was the gold medal game vs Finland. I just watched the tape of the miracle game. ABC wasn't in commercial for any of the goals.
8220 2018-02-22 18:41:16 He's a strong gold medal candidate, but he has a certain unapproachable quality the other competitors don't.
8221 2018-02-22 18:41:11 @POTUS So Mueller spent  $68M to indict 13 Russians over $46,000 In Facebook ads?  68 million could feed millions of people in need and some medical to others. Government money is wasted every minute of every day. US Treasury is a Piggy Bank to Washington Elites. Fools Gold.
8222 2018-02-22 18:41:10 Give him/her a gold star for knowing that Free Speech is for everyone.  And, extra credit for speaking truth to power.

8233 2018-02-22 18:40:39 #USA 3, #CAN 2 (SO): @moniquelam7 ties it up on breakaway with 6:21 left. After 20-minutes of OT, ridiculous move by @JocelyneUSA17 puts the US ahead in round 6 of SO and @maddie_rooney35 finishes the job for gold. (Didn't think I'd forget that one, did you?)

8252 2018-02-22 18:40:09 The woman on the right is basically a Nazi. She also claimed that CNN and MSNBC love mass shootings because crying "white women" are ratings gold.. No mention of African Americans or Hispanic Americans.
8253 2018-02-22 18:40:09 Your blog is a gold mine filled with nuggets of content waiting to be extracted, refined and cast into books. It all depends on how you do it and do it right. 

Tomorrow at 7pm, @heturabooks and I  will come your way with a conversation  to show you how to do it.

8255 2018-02-22 18:40:05 So I was reading Twitter today and started thinking 

Here is a message for people out there, if you don't like Columbia then go somewhere else, no one begging you to stay if you don't like it

Columbia is family thing for people who bleed purple and gold
8256 2018-02-22 18:40:04 シルバーフロンティア･･･なぜ名前を変えて戻って来たのか知らねえが、今の俺の力を見せてやるぜ
8257 2018-02-22 18:40:00 And everyone wear Green and Gold
8258 2018-02-22 18:40:00 Hmmm....I'd say Howie being the re-established #1...or Datsyuk since he's about to play overnight to go try and win a Gold.
8259 2018-02-22 18:39:57 Like the other guy tweeted, is the ice booked?  How about one 20 minute period 4 on 4, If tied, 3 on 3 until some body scores?  I favour 5 on 5 sudden death.  Both teams earned the right to play it out.  Basically the gold is decided the same way as the loser point.
8260 2018-02-22 18:39:53 Good luck!  Bring back the gold.
8261 2018-02-22 18:39:53 personally i am SO glad that i am not eating meat just because it gives me such a good conscience and this is a rly nice feeling. personally i'm feeling bad enough already thinking of all the other shit that's going down that i'm not willing to change outta "laziness"

8268 2018-02-22 18:39:39 @Emma4Change, @DLoesch said MSM loves mass shootings and crying white mothers are gold. SMH, No Dana, it's you and the @NRA who love mass shootings, it's your way to promote more gun sales because kids lives don't matter to you! #BloodOnYourHands !
8269 2018-02-22 18:39:35 Team sports are so different for the gold medal game. You lost. Races and other competitions you still made an achievement in the moment. I totally get it. I don't blame anyone who does that.
8270 2018-02-22 18:39:33 Gold Medal liars. 
8271 2018-02-22 18:39:29 if you didn’t stay up for the women’s hockey gold medal game last night, you done fucked up

8275 2018-02-22 18:39:22 Yeah, To this day I still go around hitting my head into brick boxes in search of gold coins. Those Super Mario games had such a deep underlying effect on me growing up. I still can’t find a mushroom to make me grow or shoot fire balls though I try often.

8278 2018-02-22 18:39:18 Yes it wasn’t gold  but the team didn’t play well enough in the game as they have in other games and was Very disappointed by Jocelyne Larocque after she got her and taking it off that was being a poor sport  athletes don’t do that

8281 2018-02-22 18:39:09 Happy for the US Women's Hockey Team and their gold medals but I'm undecided on the whole shoot-out thing.
8282 2018-02-22 18:39:06 Aw okay. But you mean you don’t want to congratulate the USA women team for the winning gold. Your hatred blinds you. I’m sure you are happy for the team. Unless, you hate America.
8283 2018-02-22 18:38:57 Shun Koike is a gold digger.
8284 2018-02-22 18:38:57 I mean that's what I'm guessing, none of this gold would've made it to the channel
8285 2018-02-22 18:38:54 Crazy
8286 2018-02-22 18:38:50 I say go w/ successive 5:00 4-on-4 sudden death periods with ice makes every 20:00 of gameplay in all elimination games prior to the Gold Medal game. Gold Medal game should have NHL playoff OT rules.
8287 2018-02-22 18:38:47 Got better things to do
8288 2018-02-22 18:38:47 yes. except for you lol need ya kind words daily.

8306 2018-02-22 18:38:13 And Shuster is playing for gold too!!!
8307 2018-02-22 18:38:11 Secretly you're hoping for that to happen to you 
8308 2018-02-22 18:38:10 If you don’t like my friends, suck my dick.
8309 2018-02-22 18:38:09 The Swedes vs the U.S. for gold in men’s curling. That will help the sport in America. Not a good Olympics for Canada in curling, although we did win the mixed doubles. #GoCanadaGo

8316 2018-02-22 18:37:53 She’ll keep her Siver medal but it won’t be as special to her as the Gold she won in 2014
8317 2018-02-22 18:37:52 You know, as much as it hurts, good for the Americans and they're fans. Must feel great to finally win their 3rd gold medal in hockey since people first walked on the moon.

8326 2018-02-22 18:37:28 Biggest of all is the Gold won by cross country skiers Jessie Diggins and Kikkan Randall! Historic!
8327 2018-02-22 18:37:26 As USA women's hockey won gold, it reminded me how quickly 20 yrs has gone. I took a moment to send a note to @CammiGranato. Without her persistent journey of determination & commitment we wouldn't be here. Thanks Cam for all you've done! Proud to call you a friend. #USA
8328 2018-02-22 18:37:24 Lmfao at all these Americans being so proud to finally win gold over Canada despite being favourites. You will always be behind Canada is every single way, ESPECIALLY in hockey

That's like turnin' gold to bronze, roll my eyes
8332 2018-02-22 18:37:18 I've said before as once upon a time being "awarded" the silver means I lost the Gold. Unfortunately, it's difficult to take pride in loosing.
If you Win the Bronze, that's a different feeling.
8333 2018-02-22 18:37:17 I sent my friends the most random snaps 
8334 2018-02-22 18:37:14 the mental gymnastics required to justify having #DeportThemAll and #FULLMUSLIMBAN alongside #RealistNOTRacist is gold medal worthy

8348 2018-02-22 18:36:52 Oh, I wouldn't want to start over. I've accumulated way, way, way too much gold and am now at level 103 I think it is. I think I'd cry if I lost all that hard work. LOL! Wel, not really, but ya know!
8349 2018-02-22 18:36:51 If you’re doing me wrong, that’s your heart, that’s your character, that has nothing to do with me. Nothing to do with my heart. I know I’m gold.

8361 2018-02-22 18:36:34 Gotta say watching the women’s gold medal overtime last night that was some of the worst hockey I’ve ever seen played. Canada looked bad and very amateurish. Don’t feel bad they lost especially the girl who took her medal off #Pyeongyang2018
8362 2018-02-22 18:36:31 That’s gold- I miss my girls being that age -back when Dad wasn’t a complete knob who thinks he’s funny

8366 2018-02-22 18:36:24 It sucks that a gold medal game was won by a shoot out.

8379 2018-02-22 18:35:57 They come in gold (ginger)
8380 2018-02-22 18:35:56 As someone pointed out , you win a gold medal & the bronze. But you get silver only after losing. For some it take a while to feel good about it.
8381 2018-02-22 18:35:52 I'm watching @TomFawkes stream with @ZeRoyalViking and the Kermit sections are gold.
8382 2018-02-22 18:35:51 It’s not much wiggle room with FMLA unless they’re trying to get sued. Once that doctors signed those papers it’s good as gold. They try me I’m suing & collecting more coins.
8383 2018-02-22 18:35:50 Well, I guess I'm done with this thread. Bye.
8384 2018-02-22 18:35:47 Indeed!! Making us very proud back here in WI! " Stone" those Swedes and rock the "house!!  So happy to see you guys succeed after some tough times! Get that Gold!
8385 2018-02-22 18:35:45 The US Women's Hockey team and the US Men's Curling team both beat Canada, who is a powerhouse in both sports, one to win gold and one to get the chance to play for gold! #USA #Olympics
8386 2018-02-22 18:35:44 I just want to congratulate @maddie_rooney35 it’s so crazy that I went the same high school and she now has a gold medal, IN THE OLYMPICS Holy crap!!!!!!!
8387 2018-02-22 18:35:43 You struck gold with this one, you deserve to be verified 100%
8388 2018-02-22 18:35:42 The people giving @marcorubio a shiny gold star for attending last nights #townhall are the same people that call millennial the “participation ribbon” generation.
8389 2018-02-22 18:35:40 I just breathed oxygen can I have my gold star now
8390 2018-02-22 18:35:40 Lecturing someone on being a good sport as you dangle your country’s virtual gold medal 
8391 2018-02-22 18:35:32 Also really sad that a gold medal match was aired at 11P. I couldn’t stay awake! I fell asleep right after the 3rd period and the #USWomensHockey team was still down by one. Missed the tying goal and everything else! Missed the best moment of the #Olympics
8392 2018-02-22 18:35:29 Asked Dave Hakstol about women's hockey gold medal game, he was rooting as proud Canadian or proud North Dakota alum (like Lamoureaux sisters). "See you guys" and laughs, then lavishes big praise on the sisters, saying they were wonderful people & role models for his daughter
8393 2018-02-22 18:35:27 I feel like it's even worse because not only was it USA vs Canada and for gold, but it ended in a shootout.
8394 2018-02-22 18:35:27 Final game. For the gold medal. 4 years of training. ''Yep, so we're getting bored of watching you play the game you're supposed to; please just shoot pucks at the goalie...''
8395 2018-02-22 18:35:20 We appreciate you. I’d been lighting him up pretty bad on my page. I’ll gladly eat crow…unless he chokes in the gold medal game :-D

8400 2018-02-22 18:34:56 The Women’s Hockey should be a best of 7 series for Gold between Canada @ USA... no other country is close . What a great series that would be

8402 2018-02-22 18:34:49 Are you new to curling or just intrigued by the sport? Are you loving the Olympics so far? Are you excited for USA to be in the gold medal game tomorrow night? Well, have I got good news for you!
8403 2018-02-22 18:34:39 No way should a gold medal game in the Olympics be decided by a shootout. NHL playoff format should be the case.
8404 2018-02-22 18:34:36 I think we should give Canada the gold if they would also take Trump and give us Trudeau
8405 2018-02-22 18:34:35 지금자면 못 일어날거같아서ㅠ요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
8406 2018-02-22 18:34:33 No one's pointed out yet that I've motherfucked John Shuster into an Olympic gold or silver, which has to be my greatest accomplishment yet.

8409 2018-02-22 18:34:29 I used to love the Gran Turismo games. And I still do. But I get so angry when I miss a gold medal by 0.000001 seconds... and those kids playing online rumbling on to everyone eye make me feel that all that anger for a bit of fun is not worthy anymore. I played the demo. #GTSport

8417 2018-02-22 18:34:14 The Olympics are supposed to be about the spirit of competition.  Yes, you want to win, yes, you want that Gold medal.  But, when you “win” the Silver medal, you are supposed to be dignified and accepting of it, because that is what the Olympics are supposed to be about.

It's Olympic season, & some people have gold medals in the belittling sport. 

I'm still, & will forever, be an athlete in the build others up event. 

Let's all get the gold medal doing what we know is best regardless of other's, or your own pre-event ranking position.
8435 2018-02-22 18:33:29 Jaw on the floor to learn US Men's curling is in the gold medal game. After beating CANADA, no less.

Every US curling match I saw - after the opening mixed match against the Russian dopers - has not only been a loss, but a BRUTAL, crap-the-bed-HARD, loss. Only when I look away…

8438 2018-02-22 18:33:24 Obviously a bunch of the comment makers never played sports. There’s NO pride in taking Home silver when you know it should’ve been gold. She’s a warrior.
8439 2018-02-22 18:33:19 In the short term, I could see them just doing 3 and 3 for the whole team and give Gai one of the two reds. Once they add Gold/Silver though... maybe give Marvelous the combined form for Patren 1, 2 and 3 and then the other 5 use the 3 Lupins and Gold and Silver?

8447 2018-02-22 18:33:13 I'm sure it felt like gold because that's the only thing you were able to win after going for the gold but no cigar.
8448 2018-02-22 18:33:12 @jessdiggs Team USA women's hockey gold medal win cool but so was yours. Congrats Jessie! #historicXCskiing
8449 2018-02-22 18:33:10 I agree the better team won , but i don t think a gold should be decided by a shoot out, you should win as a team and lose as a team

8454 2018-02-22 18:33:04 is that why you are wearing that god-awful gold jacket today?
8455 2018-02-22 18:33:02 3 expected Gold Medals [women’s hockey, women’s curling & men’s curling] resulted in 1 silver medal only...what is going on?

Nevertheless, sucess of an Olympic for Canada is measured by the success in Hockey, so it’s up to the boys to bring Gold home!  #GoCanada #ThisIsOurGame
8456 2018-02-22 18:32:58 @SharkFu happy birthday! @usahockey women's team got you a gold medal.
8457 2018-02-22 18:32:56 Dude you should sell me that Gold MegaMan, he’s one of the very few I don’t have
8458 2018-02-22 18:32:55 @DLoesch NRA loves tragedy cause gun sales soar after MassShootings. Dems wanting sensible gun laws are gold to you. NRA promotes civil war.
8459 2018-02-22 18:32:54 I agree 1000% with Babcock. It’s a cheesy way for anybody to win a gold medal.

8460 2018-02-22 18:32:53 I have 0 relevance to the showdown or @7ssk himself, but competitive solos is a completely different ball game especially when competing for gold ar's and potentially a 10k+ skin in the ak, participants massively alter there game. @BallonGH1 & @LehmannFPS make very valid points.
8461 2018-02-22 18:32:47 Have to frame this in gold, brah. He’s going places.

8463 2018-02-22 18:32:46 U mean no gold?
8464 2018-02-22 18:32:44 This is GOLD! 10/10  #NotMyBitcoin #BTrash
8465 2018-02-22 18:32:44 They just can't win gold without a Manitoba influence, it seems (Jones, Martin with Morris, Lawes with Morris) ... Even McCusker has relatives in Manitoba). Gushue? Mark was a Manitoba wannabe as he later moved here
8466 2018-02-22 18:32:43 I need a gold digger
8467 2018-02-22 18:32:42 You still watch a TV show with an ugly feminist in it. The gold standard. Laffin.
8468 2018-02-22 18:32:40 … And by the way, screw all the other gold medal and other medal winners that don’t think the way you do, mr #FakePresident ??
8469 2018-02-22 18:32:40 i have a heart of gold for one single human and a heart of silver for everything else. no room or time for anything less positive
8470 2018-02-22 18:32:33 They shouldn't even give the #Silver Medal out at the #Gold medal hockey games. It makes it feel so much worse, getting a medal for losing. They should just have a ceremony or something the next day and get them then. #TeamCanada #TeamUSA #USA #CAN #Olympics #PyeongChang2018
8471 2018-02-22 18:32:31 Already sold my gold because I have no faith in you giving pkers what they want instead of listening to iron men/redditers
8472 2018-02-22 18:32:27 Congrats to Maddie Rooney and the rest of the USA Women’s championship team. #Gold

8475 2018-02-22 18:32:25 It mst b an embarrassment, sadness, during what's TRIUMPH for 4+ yrs of hard athletic training, striving, determination that earned them&USA th wins we needed. Figures; Mr. Trump; please point out that it was American Women who won Gold! Its so important that especly U do this!
8476 2018-02-22 18:32:25 lmaoooo this is gold
8477 2018-02-22 18:32:23 What a Team What a Game ..Bravo Bravo  Heroes Role Models for our little ones.. This Team should get a Parade for bringing the Gold back Home to USA..not since 20yrs Wow .... Congratulations USA is so Proud... I would have liked more coverage of the games and reruns of them also

8481 2018-02-22 18:32:05  - 20 years without a gold in Women’s hockey, we were bound to give you one. Haha just kidding, that game was awesome!

8483 2018-02-22 18:32:00 congrats and "well played" to team USA - but a shoot-out in a Gold Medal Olympic game? - bad idea - should play Hockey until a winner emerges.
8484 2018-02-22 18:31:59 And yes silver is still a huge accomplishment but for the bronze and gold you have to win your last game of the tournament. Silver is the only medal that you have to lose, it’s upsetting when you are so close.
8485 2018-02-22 18:31:58 Go for gold!!!!

8491 2018-02-22 18:31:47 I love when athletes in the Olympics take a medal off after getting it if it’s not gold. Like really? You got an opportunity that a lot of people DREAM of getting and you’re just gonna disrespect it like that? I don’t get it.

8500 2018-02-22 18:31:36 @HaydenMadsen this is straight gold.
8501 2018-02-22 18:31:35 I understand the historical significance of the 1980 Men's team win...however...lets NOT diminish the historical significance of the Women's Gold medal by trying to measure it against the Men's. The wins are on 2 totally different plains.

8513 2018-02-22 18:31:09 @expomick went to our home game in Adirondack(Glens Falls) last night then to the bar to watch the Ottawa game and the Gold Medal game. How did they end, you ask? Shootout, shootout, shootout. And I watched every second of them.

8524 2018-02-22 18:30:55 I can’t blame that Canadian player for taking off her Silver Medal...Wen u EXPECT to win Gold...It’s hard to be happy with Silver...That wasn’t wat she went there for
8525 2018-02-22 18:30:53 Women's hockey team wins gold and the p.o.s's at NBC show crap like figure skating!!! Not one hockey game in 2 weeks. What the f*@K is wrong with dumb liberal NBC!!!
8526 2018-02-22 18:30:53 glad for the United States but sorry that I was unable to watch the Olympics because of the way that they were broadcast I don’t like it when our president is trashed and homosexuality is held up like a gold-medal I don’t care what anyone does keep it in your bedroom.please

8528 2018-02-22 18:30:52 So where are the gas chamber? Ovens to dispose of the emaciated bodies when the mass graves became overcrowded. Where is soap made of dead Pals? Where are the number tattoos? Where are the piles of gold teeth, shoes, clothing removed from the dead? Medical experimentation?

8530 2018-02-22 18:30:49 He probably had 3 pairs of shoes. He got more clothes when a gold digger got a hold of him and tried to make him preppie. She also got new boobs, face lift, College for her son. Thankfully he didn’t marry her.

8541 2018-02-22 18:30:35 I don't agree with that action, but there sure was some bullshit reffing. Not to mention the travesty of a gold medal decided by shootout.

8544 2018-02-22 18:30:29 Me too, but I feel like the tradition goes back to prospecting days when people tested gold with their teeth because real gold is soft enough to reshape.
8545 2018-02-22 18:30:29  where are you getting these from? Gold
8546 2018-02-22 18:30:25 *missed not mixed. And idk, weren’t the USA women supposed to be in the gold medal game whereas the ‘80 men were a streaking comet from out of nowhere? You might be right.

8560 2018-02-22 18:29:59 I think the most awkward part of winning a gold medal would be all of the people asking me why I was wearing a gold medal around my neck in Starbucks, at the grocery store and everywhere else I went every day for the rest of my life.

8564 2018-02-22 18:29:55 You keep having OT till someone wins. There was nothing wrong for her taking off that silver medal because a shoot out is a stupid way to win a gold medal. You win or lose as a team and shootouts takes that all away

8566 2018-02-22 18:29:47 If last night's gold medal #Olympics women's hockey game was typical officiating for @IIHFHockey, that is a travesty. The women deserve better. The IIHF needs to train better referees. Maybe even bring in some men to compete with the women refs and light a fire under them.
8567 2018-02-22 18:29:47 Seems pretty reasonable I would think. So you're American who likes hockey and thinks that American women's hockey beating Canada for the gold which hasn't happened in 4 winter Olympic games isn't the biggest thing happening? Sorry I didn't just roll my eyes at it.

8572 2018-02-22 18:29:38 I thought going gold meant the game was fully developed and ready for release?

You are one hardfaced cow and come across as shrill and insanely intense.  You are not likeable at all.  Dial in down a bit.
8578 2018-02-22 18:29:28 This quotes on another level
8579 2018-02-22 18:29:26 So Saturday at 130 am is going to be this gold medal curling match? Figuring out sleep is going to be fun...

8581 2018-02-22 18:29:23 Anything other than red, white, black.. or Gold for “trims and writing only” shouldn’t even be entertained
8582 2018-02-22 18:29:23 I applaud your efforts.. it's worth more than a Gold Medal 
8583 2018-02-22 18:29:22 All I wanted was a gold medal.

8589 2018-02-22 18:29:15 You meant to congratulate @chloekimsnow on her gold medal too, right?
8590 2018-02-22 18:29:15 Congrats to the USA @ CDN Women's Hockey Teams on a very exciting  Gold Medal game! USA won Gold on the Shootout! The difference between  winning the Stanley Cup or not is a goaltender poke check on breakaways."Johhny Bower" A poke check might have won a CDN Gold in the shootout!
8591 2018-02-22 18:29:14 No maybe about it there, that's a solid gold nugget of 3-word goodness
8592 2018-02-22 18:29:11 Everyone here is feeling the pride of the U.S. Women's Olympic gold medal hockey win and Kacey's role in that victory.  A big day for Westfield!
8593 2018-02-22 18:29:10 Yoga teacher: How are you?
Me. I'm exhausted. I stay up past 2 am to watch #OlympicHockey. 
Another student: Yeah, the girls won!
Me: They are women, but yes, they did.
Student: And how about the #usamenscurling going for gold?
Me: You mean the boys?

8597 2018-02-22 18:28:56 Yeah I was definitely rooting for Canada, but if they had to lose to anyone, I’m glad it was the US.  That was a HELL of a gold medal game!
8598 2018-02-22 18:28:55 Skeleton gold? Send in Lizzy Yaaarnold! #Piratepuns
8599 2018-02-22 18:28:52 Nobody likes shootouts for gold medal (or any medal game) game. It's dumb and needs to be changed.
8600 2018-02-22 18:28:51 Where did you even find this? This is GOLD
8601 2018-02-22 18:28:50 Congrats to the @usahockey women’s team on winning gold yesterday!!! Gotta love the shootout #Golden
8602 2018-02-22 18:28:50 (2/2)Taking off her medal and standing with it is a sign that she is not content with being a loser. Its a sign that losing isnt acceptable and that they need to work if they want to bring back gold in 2022. Canada showed sportsmanship all throughout the #PyeongChang2018 olympics
8603 2018-02-22 18:28:49 I would compare winning a gold medal in a shootout to  loosing the popular vote but still winning the Electoral College in a Presidential election!
8604 2018-02-22 18:28:46 We're happy to respond, but the Gold should already be in your game! If not, email us at adventurecapitalist@hyperhippo.ca.
8605 2018-02-22 18:28:45 E- You would look GREAT in black and gold!!

8612 2018-02-22 18:28:31 @jessdiggs I just wanted to thank you for representing the USA! I knew you could do it! Just from watching your first race at the Olympics this year, I knew you would win gold. Youre amazing and quickly became my favorite Olympian seeing how much of a fighter you are #inspiration
8613 2018-02-22 18:28:26 Anyone know if any newspaper out there would be printing and highlighting the women’s team winning gold? #Olympics #PyeongChang2018 #USA @usahockey
8614 2018-02-22 18:28:24 Gold sounds good in theory but I prefer red.
8615 2018-02-22 18:28:22 This is gold.
8616 2018-02-22 18:28:15 i used to think the same, but as ive seen more and more, ive understood why its hated and i hate it myself. I'd rather players play legitimate hockey rather than playing a mode of it for a gold medal. congrats to team usa tho

8622 2018-02-22 18:28:07 I’m not mad @usahockey beat @HockeyCanada for women’s gold. I’m heartbroken for the girls who put their blood sweat and tears into this tournament just to be short changed by a rule that makes little sense. I’m tremendously proud of them and being Canadian  #OhCanada
8623 2018-02-22 18:28:07 Congratulations to the US women’s hockey team on their gold medal win. It has been a heck of a year for all your achievements.

8628 2018-02-22 18:27:55 Exactly! My childs school had "skeet shooting" as a sport - most of the boys and some girls shoot - One was a Olympic gold medalist for sharp shooting.  I'm sure they had their guns in their trucks/cars in the parking lot. Someone/vet protecting school with a gun would normal.
8629 2018-02-22 18:27:53 >Gold cover
Into the trash it goes
8630 2018-02-22 18:27:50 @KKurzNHL really love your insight, but now that @usahockey is flying high after the gold medal game, do you think any of the current women’s roster could make a case for an @NHL team? Or @TheAHL ?
8631 2018-02-22 18:27:49 These are the same teams that played in the Jr and we will won gold there so  Canada  is still number one in hockey
8632 2018-02-22 18:27:48 why are red and gold trying to become alpha shitposters. they're already living shitposts.

8644 2018-02-22 18:27:22 He was probably just as proud to have 9 of his players in last night’s Gold Medal Game
8645 2018-02-22 18:27:21 I'm one of the first people to tell you that a shootout is not a way to decide a game, much less a gold medal final. However, it creates drama and there were so many non-hockey fans who were drawn in to what was happening last night. And that's best for women's hockey.
8646 2018-02-22 18:27:19 @inawoodenhouse
8647 2018-02-22 18:27:18 A gold medal game should not be decided with the shootout. I would say the same thing if Canada won it as well.
8648 2018-02-22 18:27:15 Damn them gold 1s not even flipping that much
8649 2018-02-22 18:27:14 Work from home Aged. It’s a cute girl but girl canolas vocals ruined it. Self titled made me realize how better they sound without her and to listen to old material just don’t sound as gold anymore
8650 2018-02-22 18:27:13 Definitely different, but I would venture to say it takes more athleticism. Even still, it is an olympic curling event and a gold was won.
8651 2018-02-22 18:27:11 あ????まってかわいいけどお前だれだ……………………
8652 2018-02-22 18:27:10 Please leave his fine ass alone.
8653 2018-02-22 18:26:59 Agreed, I understand it must be hard to come so close and not achieve your goal but...good thing Gold IS OUR color  #USA
8654 2018-02-22 18:26:59 Aah thank you too... Gotta spread the word about these cheerful, multi-use, life-sustaining discs of gold :)
8655 2018-02-22 18:26:57 “Many in legacy media love mass shootings,” Loesch said after walking on  stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference to a standing  ovation. “I’m not saying you love the tragedy, but you love the ratings.  Crying white mothers are ratings gold.”
8656 2018-02-22 18:26:57 @awndalum did you see this. Not even hiding her desire for a pure bred white race.
8657 2018-02-22 18:26:55 Don’t fool yourself. Canada WON the silver through their play leading up to the gold medal match (so did the US). Then the US won the gold.

8662 2018-02-22 18:26:37 Apologies, I meant South Africa with the land grab. Pls provide source stating anglo boer war (1899-1902) was about slavery and not gold and diamonds.

8710 2018-02-22 18:24:43 Observation is a lot of retail/weak hands have been shaken recently and pro money is now flowing into BTC.

8726 2018-02-22 18:24:09 Observation is a lot of retail/weak hands have been shaken recently and pro money is now flowing into BTC. Q: if this is the case wouldn't it suggest that BTC would follow similar type of manipulation as gold and silver? Would BTC ever really moon with pro-money/traders  around?

8729 2018-02-22 18:24:06 @RyanSchuiling Did you watch the US Nordic skiing gold medal performance? What a call by @ChadSalmela during that final lap.
8730 2018-02-22 18:24:05 Not only did the US women beat Canada for gold, the men also did it in curling! Great day for the best kind of Americans, even John Shuster, who most of us loathed just 5 days ago.

8735 2018-02-22 18:23:59 In your opinion— Do you think a “shootout” is the right way to award a gold medal? I’m not a fan of it. Play until someone scores a legit goal.

8747 2018-02-22 18:23:29 @HondaCanada you get on this and make a gold Odyssey model.  With heated seats complete with olympic medal and @TimHortons cup holders.
8748 2018-02-22 18:23:28 
8749 2018-02-22 18:23:28 I saw the announcement but pretty much disregarded it because there wasn't a release date.  It's all publicity until there's an actual commitment date.  Now we know Silva is waiting on Murray Gold.  The timing is anyone's guess at the moment.
8750 2018-02-22 18:23:24 Don’t think that’s a valid comment. Even with “actual” gold, we always compare it to the usd value:)

8761 2018-02-22 18:23:03 Not surprising. They forgot that they are supposed to be an extension of God and Jesus. Not profit from people. Hypocrites and Corrupted sitting on Gold, money, paintings, banks...Don't forget they've sided with Nazis to save themselves. Was raised Catholic
8762 2018-02-22 18:23:02 Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson goal last night to win gold was just sick! It could rival a lot of NHL goals. Old school skating and stick handling. Great job #TeamUSAWomen #hockey #USAvsCAN #Olympics2018 #GoldMedal
8763 2018-02-22 18:23:00 After seeing Canada lose to the U.S. in the world juniors in a shootout two years ago, I will never understand how a gold medal game can be decided by essentially a skills competition #joke
8764 2018-02-22 18:23:00 3/3 …@jessdiggs + @kikkanimal proved it takes more than $$ to be champions. They just changed US history + inspired athletes everywhere who are taking the hard road to gold.

8769 2018-02-22 18:22:39 Is that the same as taking a knee during the national anthem?  Of course everyone wants to win the gold. Losing in a shootout after overtime after a blistering game, there is no shame in that. Could have gone either way y

8790 2018-02-22 18:22:04 It is unreasonable: just because it hasn’t been confirmed, doesn’t mean it’s not true. Would you dismiss something that even in the smallest of chances could be true? Especially if it has eternal consequences?

8806 2018-02-22 18:21:32 Many in legacy media love mass shootings… Crying white mothers are ratings gold.” — NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch.

Is she human?
8807 2018-02-22 18:21:30 @DLoesch started every sentence on CNN's town hall w her fake sympathetic "I'm a mother...."I hope Dana Loesch, NEVER has to experience what these parents have experienced, because SHE too, will be "A crying white mother
for ratings gold", GoodGod Dana, how HEARTLESS Can U- Be
8808 2018-02-22 18:21:28 You did get that that Canad still leads the US in total medals and in Gold, right?
8809 2018-02-22 18:21:25 I thought Facebook people are dumb but yoooh twitter people. I remember Miracle telling Tobi to leave Ceec cause she a gold digger cause he was HOH. i remeber alot of people in the house including us viewers saying Tobi must break free from CeeC's spell. 
8810 2018-02-22 18:21:19 Looks like #TeamUSA is trying to creep back into top 3 medals spot. Only 3 away from 3rd spot with medal potential in few more events like that #Gold medal #curling match-up! #Olympics
8811 2018-02-22 18:21:19 I have no problem with this, she did not like finishing 2nd.  However she stood there and respected the US when they got the gold.  That was sportsmanship and more important.  Her disappointment w/silver is a personal thing
8812 2018-02-22 18:21:19 The psychology between bronze and silver is so funny to me. Silver medalists are typically upset because they feel they lost the gold after being so close to it, whereas bronze medalists are elated because they almost got no medal at all, and here they are with a medal. 
8813 2018-02-22 18:21:18 Meagan defending her friend is admirable but when she spews her rhetoric, that seems contrary to Meagan's stance
Loesch said many in the media “love mass shootings,” adding, “crying white mothers are ratings gold.” But these aren’t the only controversial comments the she made.
8814 2018-02-22 18:21:14 Those interviews are gold
8815 2018-02-22 18:21:12 The gold medal USA vs Canada womens hockey game was amazing.  So intense
8816 2018-02-22 18:21:11 It must be so hard to have all those expectations on you. It’s gold or fail.
8817 2018-02-22 18:21:10 @expomick The winner always enjoys the shootout...the loser always wants to change the format. I loved it! But that may be because I was the winner! #TeamUSA #Gold #GoStars
8818 2018-02-22 18:21:07 "Crying white mothers is ratings gold [for the media]" @DLoesch said this horrible thing today. These are horrible people. But the citizenry is going to do what America's feckless politicians won't and in 1 hour, all of the NRA's power and influenced will be destroyed

8828 2018-02-22 18:20:56 Well, that's kinda dumb to not have any next year. Are they salty Shaun White took home most of the gold?
8829 2018-02-22 18:20:55 You have to understand this is their national pastime. Hockey is their identity in the world. How did you think our woman’s team felt in 2014? The men & women that play this sport are extraordinary people.  To some a silver simply means you lost the gold.
8830 2018-02-22 18:20:51 Glad vonn didn’t get gold, she said negative things about our American president.
8831 2018-02-22 18:20:50 im not saying i wouldnt be emotional, i may even be crying whatever. im aware of the mentality that silver medal is losing and gold is winning, but to me its just so ignorant when someone from the olympics presents you with a medal and you take it off. gotta be gracious.
8832 2018-02-22 18:20:49 @usahockey Congrats to the usa ladies for winning gold you played a awesome game. To the canadians it was a galant effort
8833 2018-02-22 18:20:46 I originally tried gray. But that was either too similar to black or too unreadable. 

And  then gold. But that was much too faint. Even though I'd really like 'my  official' colours to be red, black, white and gold. So it would have  been perfect.

Functionality needs priority.

8849 2018-02-22 18:20:04 I’m super happy the US women’s hockey team won gold...but let’s all slow down a bit on the 1980 Miracle on Ice comparisons. Politically and Hockey wise, not even in the same league. Doesn’t change the fact that this incarnation of the women’s team is bad ass.
8850 2018-02-22 18:20:02 Fed & other global CB's desperately need gold higher (USD weaker)...don't bet against them, right?
8851 2018-02-22 18:20:01 Congrats to Team USA on their well-deserved victory. Just remember, USA, we're only loaning you the Gold. We'll be taking it back in four years. In the meantime, please test your smoke & CO alarms. They'll keep you safe 'til the rematch.
8852 2018-02-22 18:20:01 He has one in gold.

8860 2018-02-22 18:19:42 He Is out control, the shadow government stop this clown.  Wait he is the useful idiot. He will destroy this government for them. In return he recieve unlimited gold in return.
8861 2018-02-22 18:19:38 Amen! It's been 20 years. Glad they brought home the Gold!
8862 2018-02-22 18:19:37 When #Canada fails on the #Olympic stage, it leads to a summit. It's gold or nothing in #Canadian #curling in the #Olympics.
8863 2018-02-22 18:19:36 WOMEN'S OLYMPIC HOCKEY GOLD over Canada! Whoo hoo!
8864 2018-02-22 18:19:35 My older daughter’s team lost a ball hockey gold in an OT shoot out last year and it was sooo hard (and their season only lasts three months - it’s not a once every 4 years only the best compete type of event)
8865 2018-02-22 18:19:35 ATTI: #MLBG To Towers Bus 294 running the Blue & Gold is at the Grant & 1st bus stop: 2/22/2018 1:19:31 PM. Next stop: Beechurst@1st.

8867 2018-02-22 18:19:23 i don't care sui & han are MY gold medalists 
8868 2018-02-22 18:19:21 The gold face paint is missing and tragic clowns, are well not looking tragic enough without there costumes. 
8869 2018-02-22 18:19:19 I saw some people were upset with the lack of gold on this one, but i love it. Im always a fan of white kits, the white crest tops it off 
8870 2018-02-22 18:19:18 Negativity is really a choice, you make the choice to look at the bad and shift your focus on that, and that’s the energy you put out. Adjust your focus.
8871 2018-02-22 18:19:16 We always say "can you imagine having the balls/cojones" to do something and that's some BS, so I need a new phrase and I'm drawing a blank? 

What's a better way of saying I can't believe J Lam had the wherewithal to pull that move off in a sudden death gold medal shooutout?
8872 2018-02-22 18:19:16 NRA representative says media ‘loves mass shootings’ as ‘crying white mothers are ratings gold’ -
8873 2018-02-22 18:19:13 @moniquelam7 @JocelyneUSA17 time to update your twitter profiles ladies: 6X World Champions, 2X Olympic Silver Medalists, & 2018 OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALISTS! Amazing breakaway goal to tie, even better shootout goal for the ! @Datsyuk13 would be proud of that move  #OOPSIDIDITAGAIN
8874 2018-02-22 18:19:10 USA women’s hockey really won gold and men’s hockey got eliminated 
8875 2018-02-22 18:19:07 Gold jewelry, shinin so bright.
8876 2018-02-22 18:19:04 at this point i think my nose runs so fast it could bring the usa home a gold medal
8877 2018-02-22 18:19:03 3 things Canada must do to reach final, win gold 
It's simple ...  #1 Win #2 Win #3 Win .... It won't be easy

8882 2018-02-22 18:18:53 Old trick for Indian companies. They bought Zod Gold mine in Armenia overnight there was a horde from the Indian sub continent. Two ticks the Armenians pulled their license for some cyanide infringement and sent the whole lot packing
8883 2018-02-22 18:18:49 It’s ok I got you!
8884 2018-02-22 18:18:44 Glad we won simply because Canada always expects to win gold in hockey.

8889 2018-02-22 18:18:37 look i was just annoyed at a few people acting like they deserve gold when they didn’t win. i didn’t mean to speak to all canadians or claim i know everything.

8894 2018-02-22 18:18:27 Well you know, according to the trolls now using this situation as an opportunity to attack. (Like they do everything else) Supposedly now if you don't have multiple gold medals you're a loser as well as now every bronze and silver medalists in our history is also a loser...
8895 2018-02-22 18:18:25 You do realise it was Blair and Brown who deregulated the banks, that led to the inevitable banking crash.
Sold the gold cheap. And went wholesale pfi and indebted councils to £bns of long term debt.
Economic advice from labour is like asking a homeless person for a loan of £10
8896 2018-02-22 18:18:23 Congrats to the US Women who won hockey gold. @usahockey

8900 2018-02-22 18:18:07 This method goes back to Slavery. Oppressors have always used it. For the past 50yrs its been Republican Gold.

8908 2018-02-22 18:17:53 Was happy to hear the women won gold in uncontested breakaway shots last night
8909 2018-02-22 18:17:53 The ones you buy are yours forever, even with the Gold discount.
8910 2018-02-22 18:17:50 Your work is gold, I love it, muak
8911 2018-02-22 18:17:49 These women are awesome!  Congrats on your Gold Medal!
8912 2018-02-22 18:17:49 Nah it's normal for you guys to have that sport settle in that fashion but in Hockey it's painful as fuck to see, especially in a Gold Medal game. In NHL playoffs those games have "Continous OT" meaning they keep playing 20 minute long 5v5 hockey with next goal winning.
8913 2018-02-22 18:17:48 How about gold alternates?
8914 2018-02-22 18:17:46 If that is the kit, as a designer, they should have struck a deal with YouTube tv to allow them to change the red to gold for the kit sake.
8915 2018-02-22 18:17:43 @NikoTamurian @CNYcentral Niko, I have to eat crow on this one. Here I am talking about the women's hockey game and what did I do last night? Zzzzzzzz. But I am happy that we finally won the Gold! Now onto men's curling final haha!
8916 2018-02-22 18:17:41 Ontem os cara tavam pulando da gold pra geral e eu tava passando bem na hora e o cara ATERRIZOU no meu braço e ta doendo afu. Só que fazendo isso ele caiu no chão e abriu um galo na testa 
8917 2018-02-22 18:17:40 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA THIS IS GOLD
8918 2018-02-22 18:17:37 Congrats that is awesome.  Don't follow hockey but enjoyed watching y All win the Gold.  #USA
8919 2018-02-22 18:17:35 I have all of my notes from 8th grade. 8 had notebooks I passed back and forth with friends. I should dig through them for Twitter gold sometime.
8920 2018-02-22 18:17:34 This is a low blow. I’ve never heard any reporters, producers or editors working to cover these horrible shootings say this is ratings gold for us let’s get to work. Just an outrageous comment.
8921 2018-02-22 18:17:33 ugh you should. EP49 just feels like a gold mine for that
8922 2018-02-22 18:17:33 YES! The girls are bringing home the gold! That was a close game, I am recovering too, it went pretty late and I was on the edge of my seat! #TwitterSmarter #USAvsCAN

8926 2018-02-22 18:17:13 @NRA, Dana Loesch, Your words against the media, saying they 'love mass shootings', and 'white, crying mothers are gold' are horrific, outrageous,  and sick! YOU and your insane rhetorical babble are a danger to our children and the peace and safety of our Nation!

8930 2018-02-22 18:17:06 She's been annoying the whole time. I don't even care about the political stuff. I sort of hate her snide remarks about other athletes, like the snowboarder who got gold in the Giant Slalom.

8947 2018-02-22 18:16:28 @usacurl please help me! Earlier@today @DIRECTV guide said gold metal match on nbcsn at noon (Chicago time). Took off of work at 12:30 and RACED home- they are showing Sweden and Switzerland! I can’t find the match!!!! OMG- it’s must see! @MattJamilton
8948 2018-02-22 18:16:27 Of course all of Canada's Women should hold their head's high, they can't win Gold all the time - It was someone else's turn!!
8949 2018-02-22 18:16:26 Nice pulls. Looks like you need more gold for all the ranking

8953 2018-02-22 18:16:17 Hockey seems like the national sport of Canada. Winning a silver seems like a failure. But unfortunately, we lost this time! Never mind! We would win the gold back again in Beijing!
8954 2018-02-22 18:16:12 Andy Reid of Curling and #TeamUSA upset Canada.  USA going for gold in curling.

8956 2018-02-22 18:16:10 She was completely cordial with the opposition. Why is it so bad she’s disappointed in not winning gold?
8957 2018-02-22 18:16:07 Team USA won their first gold in hockey in 20 years by a shootout let them have it, it'll be at least another 20 if they ever win again. Their men hockey team will never win anything, they're a joke year after year lol
8958 2018-02-22 18:16:04 @HilaryKnight congrats on the great goal in last night's Gold Medal match against the Canadian Womens ice hockey team

8965 2018-02-22 18:15:50 I'm more inclined to give you the Gold to keep Trudeau.  Give us our moment with the Gold.  I think you will probably win it back soon enough.

8971 2018-02-22 18:15:37 They never finish a Stanley Cup final with a shoot out nor should they settle a gold metal game in the Olympic hockey with a shoot out. Come on Olympic Hockey Governing committee wake up!
8972 2018-02-22 18:15:36 USA women had a great day at the Olympics, topped off by the hockey gold! Impressive day to watch unfold

8981 2018-02-22 18:15:20 i still sit and let myself think about how we never got a move stage where taemin was wearing the gold silk button up. we could of had it all.

8985 2018-02-22 18:15:16 I agree. So how would tweeting "Congratulations to the Team USA women for their gold medal!" not be a direct connection?
8986 2018-02-22 18:15:15 Q: Where is the training data from? A: gold standard labels from hospitals. Weak labels from events during transport.  #sthlmai
8987 2018-02-22 18:15:14 Congrats to the Woman's USA Hockey team GOLD But i HATE SHOOTOUTS Everyone has to try & change a Canadian Game because they cant beat us this is --> KILLING a CANADIAN SPORT @Olympics @NHL its sad you have to alter the game for a WIN & its the only sport we treat this way
8988 2018-02-22 18:15:09 That was gold! Great job, guys!
8989 2018-02-22 18:15:08 Sorry you lost gold last night ya Hoser
8990 2018-02-22 18:15:07 the fucking tokyo tower was lit on gold to celebrate their victory, IS NOT LIKE THEY ARE LACKING SOME TYPE OF RECOGNITION
8991 2018-02-22 18:15:06 If “crying white mothers are ratings Gold” what are crying black mothers? Let’s hear it again how the NRA hasn’t gone full white supremacy.

8997 2018-02-22 18:14:59 Maybe it's because it's the least phoney? In real terms, the Canadian market priced in gold for the past 30 years is more stable and closely reflecting real GNP than its global counterparts.

Look a little deeper than the data massaged by national banks, guys.
8998 2018-02-22 18:14:54 Fine  lol
8999 2018-02-22 18:14:54 Men's Bobsled put on a show. The Women's Bobsled matched them or even topped them. What a run for Gold. #Olympics
9000 2018-02-22 18:14:53 no it was an overtime loss in 2014 but a shootout is technically an overtime loss. im not a fan of shootouts, especially the new nhl rules. it used to be 3 overtimes 5 on 5 then a shootout. shootouts aren't hockey it's like a home run derby.. to decide a gold medal.
9001 2018-02-22 18:14:51 Nothing I’ve seen during these Olympics even compares to when in 1996 Kurt Angle won a gold medal WITH A BROKEN FREAKIN’ NECK
9002 2018-02-22 18:14:51 Problem is ....Us equity correlates to International equity, and rates rising kills bond prices...hedges are gold/cash? Gold sucks....

9006 2018-02-22 18:14:36 Glad to see the US win another gold, but women's hockey is terrible and boring.
9007 2018-02-22 18:14:35 How is South Africa going to create jobs if we keep selling out our raw materials. Gold , diamonds , iron ore , raw hide , coal. We should create products and create jobs.
9008 2018-02-22 18:14:34 It was gold in its natural form but the editing made it a work of art!

9010 2018-02-22 18:14:33 Megan's friend Dana: ""Many in legacy media love mass shootings. You guys love it," Dana Loesch said Thursday. "Now I'm not saying that you love the tragedy. But  I am saying that you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you..." -- unbelievable, Megan. Wow.
9011 2018-02-22 18:14:28 Ketla nwa gold
9012 2018-02-22 18:14:25 I would ague neither (of course). They didn’t lose it, they played great and the Americans beat them. But you don’t win silver when realistically that’s the worst they would finish. This tournament was about two teams for Gold and the Americans won
9013 2018-02-22 18:14:25 In celebration of the US Women winning the gold medal in hockey last night, Truman has transformed into an ice rink.
9014 2018-02-22 18:14:24 We always believe in you.Thank to all your team for bringing home a gold medal.

Where is the Notorious diplomat that weas expect to deliver some gold to me!!! that could help me to help you. tghat is looking likes if they would have waiting for me to die quick
9017 2018-02-22 18:14:20 The hilarious name US women's hockey hero gave to her gold medal-winning shot Congratulations, with bitter taste on man ice hockey without NHL players. Heads of NHL spits on Olympic movement and most on Maple leaf and Stars&stripes. Selfish hunger for money denaying citizienship!
9018 2018-02-22 18:14:16 @DLoesch if crying white mothers are gold, then what are the crying black mothers who lose their kids to gun violence everyday?

9020 2018-02-22 18:14:13 @CNN @DLoesch, a white mother, just said that white women with murdered children are gold to the media and their ratings??She is absolutely abhorrent and a complete fraud. Kids, last night she was Mrs Jekyll and today she is Mrs Hyde. #danadisgustsme #ParklandStudents

9023 2018-02-22 18:14:08 @TomiLahren you talk about being for this country but yet USA wins gold last night and not one thing from you
9024 2018-02-22 18:14:06 Coming up: Darya Domracheva entered PyeongChang just one away from becoming the first female biathlete to win 4 Olympic gold medals … See her run the anchor leg for Belarus, in snowfall and heavy winds, at the women’s 4x6km relay
9025 2018-02-22 18:14:06 Phil on shootouts to determine gold: I mean, I liked it last night. In hockey I think they probably should play for it, play out overtimes. But how long has it been going on for the Olympics that way? A long time, and I think it'll probably stay that way.
9026 2018-02-22 18:14:05 @James_LRR @RebelliousUno I haven't had time to watch the last Minecraft VOD yet but dear god there's so much gold in these clips
9027 2018-02-22 18:14:05 Commentator said it perfectly. They didn’t win Silver. They lost Gold.

Bronze you’re happy you made it. Silver, you were that close.
9028 2018-02-22 18:14:05 "Show me the most damaged parts of your soul ,and I will show you how it still shines like gold"

9039 2018-02-22 18:13:48 Very proud of our women, they did incredible. Congrats to the US on Gold. It is always a great matchup.
9040 2018-02-22 18:13:42 And they shouldn't, the repetition is unnecessary. Like the 8 million times they said Canada had won 4 straight Gold Medals...
9041 2018-02-22 18:13:37 Dana Loesch: “Crying white mothers are ratings gold.” I hope that’s not a code for killers to go after black kids so there will be “black crying mothers.” #parkland
9042 2018-02-22 18:13:36 //I get that Canadas womens hockey team didnt win gold but the fact one of our athletes refused to wear their silver medal because-

9044 2018-02-22 18:13:31 Totally agree. Players work for four years towards Olympic gold. They should win or lose as a team; not by a one on one "game".
9045 2018-02-22 18:13:30 I don't rlly have anyone to talk to about those sooo
9046 2018-02-22 18:13:29 Sell gold now. Do the opposite of CNbs
9047 2018-02-22 18:13:28 @MeghanMcCain Please talk to your friend @DLoesch about her outrageous statement "Crying white mothers are ratings gold"....

9052 2018-02-22 18:13:23 I would rather be all those things than win a gold metal!  Besides, #Canada is still kicking US asses in overall metals and our men’s team is still in the running 4 gold! #GoCanadaGo
9053 2018-02-22 18:13:22 Sis thanks for that gold advice..!! Made my day and sorted my life seriously..!!
9054 2018-02-22 18:13:22 im still hype that USA won the gold in hockey.

Takes "Gold Medal 4 BS" & even hijacked the  "We Call BS" statement used by survivors of Parkland FL Survivors of AR Massacre. Really ?  In less than 10 mins he Insults EVERY individual & institution of the US & then compliments them.
9059 2018-02-22 18:13:15 Seeing the US women’s hockey team win gold makes me miss playing hockey

9063 2018-02-22 18:13:04 Dana Loesch saying that "crying white mothers are ratings gold" is further proof that right-wing racists are gaslighting when they pretend to have no concept of white racial privilege or how systemic racism operates
9064 2018-02-22 18:13:02 Well she had her gold from 2014 and I know u wanna repeat but again silver is fine...We are very competitive for hockey I know lol

9073 2018-02-22 18:12:46 Always enjoy hearing Phil asked about Amanda instead of the other way around. He talked to her before and after game; said she can't believe it. "I'm v proud of her. She missed a lot of time with her concussion and, to be able to win a gold medal, it's a special accomplishment."

9078 2018-02-22 18:12:41 @Softykjr you should do an annual bring back the Sonics show. Where you get all the greats to come on your show and talk about the green and gold.

9080 2018-02-22 18:12:36 NRA:Many in the media love mass shooting,crying white mothers r ratings gold.
What to say to that?
9081 2018-02-22 18:12:36 Team USA mens curling team (mainly made up of MN boys) beat Canada (who had won the previous 3 golds) and is going for the gold on Saturday at 2AM on NBCSN... Set your DVRs!!

#OlympicChampions #gold #usawomenshockey
9085 2018-02-22 18:12:25 @DLoesch True, dead children are MSM gold. Murdered school children are also gold 4 elected officials (more contributions from the NRA) and gold 4 the NRA (more gun sales).

9089 2018-02-22 18:12:17 @DLoesch Your claims that grieving families are just “ratings gold” minimizes the impact of hundreds of school shootings and hundreds more mass shootings in churches, concerts, and theaters. #ParklandFlorida #GunReformNow #GunControlNow #KillTheNRA

9097 2018-02-22 18:11:57 Why are people mad that Dana Loesch said that "crying white mothers are ratings gold". She's not lying. Crying black mothers in the media fall upon deaf ears. @NRA
9098 2018-02-22 18:11:54 They are awesome!! Congrats I will be up early to watch them Go for the Gold 
9099 2018-02-22 18:11:51 Bullshit is ratings gold for Fox (Fake) News.

9101 2018-02-22 18:11:49 After years of being an Xbox Gold subscriber, I finally shut off my subscription today before it auto-renewed. MS really dropped the ball in 2016/17 and doesn't look like it's on track to make 18 better. My Xbone hasn't even been plugged in over a year. What a waste.
9102 2018-02-22 18:11:48 gold count
9103 2018-02-22 18:11:48 Silver isn’t bad but it’s different in games like hockey where you lose a game and get rewarded silver, she wanted gold and played for gold
9104 2018-02-22 18:11:46 Nein, einfach Nein!  Aber so viel Liebe für "Old but Gold: Meine Jugend"! Nicht nur wegen dem Bild!

9109 2018-02-22 18:11:41 Go watch 2002 Gold medal game in Salt Lake City
9110 2018-02-22 18:11:41 He respects the Golden Rule that applies in Ireland: those with the gold make the rules. And petty thieving and fiddling will not be tolerated: if you steal, steal BIGLY!
9111 2018-02-22 18:11:34 Grown up  day with work closed. Got gold medal hockey game recorded and don't know the outcome yet. .
9112 2018-02-22 18:11:34 Hi there~! I am still working on the gold payment that us fed ow me. Soon that its going to be done I am going to be welling help you more reasons of God like Her majesty heat her!
9113 2018-02-22 18:11:30 The Canadian women’s Olympic Hockey Team needs to stop beating themselves up over “losing” a gold medal! From where I sit, “winning” a silver medal is a HUGE achievement! Nicely done, ladies! #womenshockey
9114 2018-02-22 18:11:30 We fucked up. That place gave us gold.
9115 2018-02-22 18:11:29 Dana Loesch: “crying white mothers are ratings gold”. Human garbage.

9118 2018-02-22 18:11:22 Our dreams are packed with powerful, vulnerable emotions. And what is hard fought will be long savored. Last night's Women's gold medal hockey game depicted those truths (from both sides). Congratulations! #Olympics #dreams #soulwhisperer
9119 2018-02-22 18:11:20 I hope we can win gold with the men. Then I’ll feel better
9120 2018-02-22 18:11:17 Our gr. 4/5 class has some questions for our @TeamCanada athletes. @phyliciageorge: what is your biggest fear at the Olympics? @markmcmorris: what was your biggest sacrifice in the Olympics? @BobsledKaillie: how did you feel when you won your gold medal #teamcanadachampionchats
9121 2018-02-22 18:11:15 And the Star lands the best "spin" during these Olympic Games!  Gold medal. Judge Number 1 (Liberal hacks) gives you a perfect score!  Bigger bailout coming!
9122 2018-02-22 18:11:11 Barley seeing this chick Chole Kim who won gold but shiiit she fine as hell no bs
9123 2018-02-22 18:11:10 Even then, if a pro player gets unlucky and loses first 2 placement games they're still stuck in gold/plat.  Best solution is to put the accounts at master 1k, zero personal rank adjustment.  But I'm not sure we have that technology.. just getting level 5s was hard.
9124 2018-02-22 18:11:10 You know what I'm in need of the most is to find somebody with further knowledge about acting and broadcasting but unfortunately for I'm disadvantaged because you live in the City of Gold..
9125 2018-02-22 18:11:08 I know I'm on the west coast , but if you like hockey & didn't stay up to watch the #USAvsCAN  game and  #USA take the gold the way they did , well ... #youlose.

He knows he's good looking that's why he goes to girls and tells them that they're cute and/or pretty

....
why
would a 4y/o do that
in such a way anyway
9128 2018-02-22 18:11:01 Silver ain't bad at all...They have their gold medals from years back and some teams do not even reach that far..No need for this.
9129 2018-02-22 18:11:00 The gold medals for curling and say, the half-pipe or any downhill skiing event shouldn't be the same. IJS

9134 2018-02-22 18:10:46 exactly and unfortunately 
9135 2018-02-22 18:10:46 I’d like to point out that the USA woman’s hockey team is 1-0 in gold medal games since the @Eagles won the super bowl! @usahockey #JustSaying
9136 2018-02-22 18:10:44 This is actually comedy GOLD
9137 2018-02-22 18:10:41 NRA spokeswoman: "Many in legacy media love mass shootings. You guys love it... Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you..." cnn. This woman is so very ugly!
9138 2018-02-22 18:10:38 I forgot about people :/ I wanted to od. And I just cut my arm. Thank you. I've gold my aunt, she's ok woth it as she's been expecting me to do it.

9142 2018-02-22 18:10:30 None of the above. Why do they allow a gold medal game to end in a shootout?!? It’s a team sport that they leave to an individual...
9143 2018-02-22 18:10:27 38th Anniversary of Miracle on Ice AND the USA Women’s Hockey team bet Canada for gold!! What a day!
9144 2018-02-22 18:10:26 How an Olympic gold medal is decided in a shootout is absolutely disgraceful
9145 2018-02-22 18:10:25 I very much need to find a bar in NYC where people will be losing their shit over the gold medal curling match tomorrow night.
9146 2018-02-22 18:10:23 Sir quick question on Goldmoney Mastercard. As the value of gold goes up, does the amount I can spend with the card go up?
9147 2018-02-22 18:10:21 Canada may have lost the Gold Medal game in women’s hockey, but we don’t have the NRA and @realDonaldTrump up here, so we’re still the real winners.

9164 2018-02-22 18:09:56 @Elise_Christie - watched your interview on BBC today. Elise, you won double, double Gold Medal in my eyes. You should be proud of your achievements, your tenacity & your skills. I felt so proud of you wearing all our hearts, on your sleeve. You are the winner.
9165 2018-02-22 18:09:55 Hockey seems like the national sport of Canada. Winning a silver seems like a failure. But unfortunately, we lost this time! Never mind! We would win the gold back again in Beijing!
9166 2018-02-22 18:09:54 im f.ckin weaaaaaaak!!!!!!!!!
9167 2018-02-22 18:09:52 I don't think it's necessarily bad sportsmanship. She was just mad at herself for not winning the gold that she wanted so badly.  The move doesn't disrespect anyone except for herself
9168 2018-02-22 18:09:51 The gold reflection is a nice touch, it compliments your smile

9172 2018-02-22 18:09:37 Congratulations ladies - Job well done earning the Gold!!
9173 2018-02-22 18:09:33 Loved it! The final round tiebreaker & "winner takes all" was *almost* as exciting as last night's @HC_Women gold medal match. I guess @sleclair09 took the cup, even tho Kris should have won if it wasn't for "winner takes all". #heartbreak just like last night's game
9174 2018-02-22 18:09:30 I have a minor issue with what image that projects.  yes you play to win, but there are a few hundred other Olympians that would give their right skate to have played for the gold and won the silver.
9175 2018-02-22 18:09:29 No, US women hockey won gold last night in a shootout.

9185 2018-02-22 18:08:57 congrats to @usahockey women's team on winning gold!
9186 2018-02-22 18:08:54 You can’t skew ratings.  I can’t stand Joy but she is ratings gold.  My guess is Meghan was brought to the show to stir things up and wow has she ever.

9192 2018-02-22 18:08:31 You accuse me of lacking objectivity while accusing a coach of deliberately sabotaging the team in the shootout of the gold medal game. That's tinfoil hat nonsense. He's not a very good or experienced head coach. But you are out of your mind, calling that shoutout lineup sabotage

9212 2018-02-22 18:07:53 Without a second and third place it nullifies the value of first place. Plus it’s all about media hype and money to be made off perceived value of the game being played. I am Canadian and still proud of this group because they almost won Gold  rather then for them winning silver
9213 2018-02-22 18:07:49 Yes ma'am! As I told my friend last night I'm not OK with just one gold. Now that we've finally gotten over the hump I want to see the ladies and hopefully men too keep it going!
9214 2018-02-22 18:07:48 I need your help..there is a restaurant in California that isallowed to serve dog meat!   I know they need to be stopped and possibly closed down.
I immediately thought of you because I know you have a heart of gold when it comes to the furbabies.  What do you think??
9215 2018-02-22 18:07:47 It's a possibility, but using know how to replicate the gold raised delta's for the costume.
9216 2018-02-22 18:07:46 Natürlich auch satire..., Realsatire...wie man wirklich Scheiße zu Gold redet
9217 2018-02-22 18:07:46 Judging by @HilaryKnight Instagram story, her night went like this. 

“Hilary you just won a gold medal, what are you gonna do now?” 

“We gonna go get wine drunk! Dilly Dilly!” 
9218 2018-02-22 18:07:46 Tonight is the night. Please let one of the Japan ladies get a bronze. We all know the gold and silver is locked with the Russians. Canadian ladies  already got their gold. 
9219 2018-02-22 18:07:39 That whole Bondi/Trump press conference exchange was unintentional comedy gold! Loved when Bondi had to gently remind Trump of that whole "due process rights" thing.
9220 2018-02-22 18:07:28 HILARY KNIGHT IS A GOLD OLYMPIC MEDALIST CHAMPION, IM CRYING
9221 2018-02-22 18:07:25 @Custa did you actually fat finger that trans on Route 66? I'm just curious because it'll make a guy like myself feel less shamed as a gold.
9222 2018-02-22 18:07:23 Hahahahhahaha Pure gold 
9223 2018-02-22 18:07:22 in medal count (by country), if a team of 16 players wins gold, that should count as
9224 2018-02-22 18:07:21 2/2 Obviously it’s not the law of the land. Also, scripture doesn’t say you have to agree with the law of the land-just to obey it. This passage is telling us to be good citizens. However, God’s law supersedes the laws of men,and when the 2 conflict, a side must be chosen
9225 2018-02-22 18:07:20 But it seems like (as someone said) that there will not be a pre-sale autos for JDM and Norman this time as it seems for GA because gold, vip and platinum will get their autos but not for us with GA passes I might be wrong but I don't know 
9226 2018-02-22 18:07:18 Dog Day Sports Poll Question with @JudgeTorre:

9227 2018-02-22 18:07:17 It is kind of funny that all the olympians that said they wouldn’t go to White House after they won gold haven’t gone on to win.
9228 2018-02-22 18:07:16 YES GIRL!!! And he better treat you like pure gold too because you deserve it

9239 2018-02-22 18:06:41 I hate losing at some simple games like checkers. Silver means nothing to me, unless it means I've won The Cup. Other than that, I want gold baby

9244 2018-02-22 18:06:30 I'm talking any tournament not just Olympics, the @IIHFHockey needs to address this&make change. Olympics, World Championship and World Juniors NO gold medal should be decided by a shootout. What's another 20 minutes of overtime and if you don't like 4vs4 do 3v3 anythings better
9245 2018-02-22 18:06:30 Probably because they're clearly a 100kph, gold-plated, towering racist.

9251 2018-02-22 18:06:23 @And_Cipriani Andrea, can you help my awesome resident Jessi Gold understand the limitations of your NMA?

9268 2018-02-22 18:05:41 The gold byobu has to do with Nakamori Akina. As for Otokogumi, Mary didn't like one of the guys ao when rumors came out of alleged illegal drug use, she fired him without an investigation. Rumors turned out to be false. Essentially, the group was broken up.

9280 2018-02-22 18:05:15 You can have the gold.  We have living school students. A trade I’ll take anytime !
9281 2018-02-22 18:05:14 I think getting gold circle tickets to @thekillers on presale will honestly be up there with one of my happiest moments in life #beatsgraduation #possiblywillbeatmyweddingday
9282 2018-02-22 18:05:12 The Forsberg? Meh. Also didn't, you know, win a gold medal.
9283 2018-02-22 18:05:10 I saw this, I know it hurt to loose gold but this was rude
9284 2018-02-22 18:05:07 we love a bit of rose gold detailing

9290 2018-02-22 18:04:53 I’ll get the boys in research to hit he archives. Those were gold.

9293 2018-02-22 18:04:50 Let's see the same outpouring of pride and excitement for @TeamShuster and @usacurl tonight as they go for #GOLD! (Though boys, it might help if @MattJamilton punched someone in the face in the middle of the match)
9294 2018-02-22 18:04:48 These Olympics will be #curling's international breakthrough.
USA will curl for gold for the first time and at least one Asian country will win a medal.
9295 2018-02-22 18:04:42 @TheChrisHau I nearly did a spit take from your last tutorial, A Chris Hau To???? That's freaking gold.

9297 2018-02-22 18:04:36 Because nothing says entitled like @IvankaTrump , hope Gold Medal winning Women's Hockey team ignore her ~
9298 2018-02-22 18:04:36 I just made a fucking banger off an old song I wrote from the vault that went in as gold but is going back in as a Grammy
9299 2018-02-22 18:04:35 Yeah, everyone should embrace her evil thoughts: "Many in the media love mass shootings," @DLoesch tells the crowd at CPAC. "Crying white mothers are ratings gold."
9300 2018-02-22 18:04:34 Glad to see the USA winning some gold medals in the big time sports.
9301 2018-02-22 18:04:30 Ever since I first mined for gold in Warcraft III as a middle schooler, visiting Blizzard HQ has been on my bucket list. Tomorrow, that dream comes true. So. Stoked.
9302 2018-02-22 18:04:29 Walton Street wins the last at @DRC_Meydan. Gold Star only 3rd. You can’t win every race you bet :) What a great day. Enjoy the winnings guys and girls. Invest in Cheltenham horses with bookies money

9305 2018-02-22 18:04:26 Is anyone writing the story of the US Women’s Hockey team’s gold medal win over Canada? Because it’s already my new favorite movie. #PyeongChang2018
9306 2018-02-22 18:04:26 Oh, come on. I’m happy our team won the gold, but I am not going to judge them for that. They just put their all into the Olympics. They had just lost the first place spot. That’s a tough loss. I have seen professional athletes act like assholes after a loss. Get over it.
9307 2018-02-22 18:04:25 As someone still 'waiting' to take the meds plunge, this hashtag has been worth its weight in gold. Thank you!
9308 2018-02-22 18:04:25 Phil Kessel on watching the #USAvsCAN gold medal game: "I was up for the game last night. Obviously I was nervous. It was a tight game and they came out on top. To be able to win a gold medal is a special accomplishment. I’m really proud of Amanda."
9309 2018-02-22 18:04:24 Congrats to Hungary on their first Olympic Gold medal ever! Also congrats to the men's 5000m short team relay breaking and almost an over two decade drought of no Winter Olympic medals. #PyeongChang2018 china #speedskating #HUN
9310 2018-02-22 18:04:21 man it’s been 31 days since sebastian olzanski last paid me gold on here
9311 2018-02-22 18:04:20 Obviously shootouts are not good in a Gold medal game. 1st series of Shootouts started by Canada and ended by US. 2nd 1 on 1 started by US. As a result Canadian goaltender had to defend twice. Nobody questioned that decision.
9312 2018-02-22 18:04:20 i wont even tell you how much i spent lol its the biggest gold sink ever. well besides housing
9313 2018-02-22 18:04:18 That one glorious moment when Larry meet halfway onstage, pulled away, giggled like high schoolers, and started fixing their hair. GOLD.

9317 2018-02-22 18:04:17 I don't know y ppl bitching over the Canadian hockey player who took her medal off.
Getting second place in a team sport doesn't mean you WON . It means u lost unlike gold and bronze where u PLACED for that event.
9318 2018-02-22 18:04:17 Haha more gold.

9323 2018-02-22 18:04:09 Someone just asked me how the #USA only has 8 #GOLD medals in the medal count when the woman’s hockey team won 23 #GOLD medals last night. 
9324 2018-02-22 18:04:05 Last night, the twinkling stars carried me off to a land of slumber... Now the only thing brighter than my eyes is that glittering pile of gold!
9325 2018-02-22 18:04:03 American Gypsy Wedding is just.......pure television gold
9326 2018-02-22 18:03:57 Mass shootings lead to more fear leads to more gun sales = actual gold.
9327 2018-02-22 18:03:57 Then he did well in performing his job, thus meriting a gold star. You don't have to get outraged about literally everything
9328 2018-02-22 18:03:55 There aren't a lot of US at the Winter Olympics so I'd be celebrating like I won the gold medal.
9329 2018-02-22 18:03:54 She’s actually right about this. And... elderly orange Tourette’s Syndrome presidential candidates (the choice of the NRA!) are also ratings gold! So. Can’t have one without the other.
9330 2018-02-22 18:03:54 Last night, the US Women’s Hockey team beat Canada for the gold medal. This morning, the US curling team knocked Canada out of gold medal contention. Suck it, Canada.
9331 2018-02-22 18:03:50 I just wanted to say that today was, at best, mediocre.

But then I discovered @Shen_the_Bird. It's gold, Jerry.

9338 2018-02-22 18:03:41 I think Diamond is the best. Master and GM have too many one tricks, Plat. Is ok but sometimes it's difficult to work as a team or have a solid team build. Gold, Silver & Bronze will occasionally have afew trolls, throwers, noobs or just "bad players"
Diamond seems very flexible.
9339 2018-02-22 18:03:40 @beckyjagoitv loving the gold fleck in your make up! It really stands out on my TV lol
9340 2018-02-22 18:03:39 @NRA Who said that crying white mother's are gold for TV???
Could this country get any more racist?
9341 2018-02-22 18:03:35 USA is facing the powerful Canadian curling team for the gold, how in the hell do you become a powerful curling team?

9344 2018-02-22 18:03:31 1/2 Unjust according to what? Again, what is your measuring stick for right & wrong/just & unjust? You asked how a judge would rule-does a judge not represent the law of the land? You accuse God of being vague & unknowable but you have yet to account for your source of morality.

9346 2018-02-22 18:03:29 Rubio is the young Congressman who carries a sack of appeasing phrases wherever he goes, always on one wagon train or another looking for more gold rather than support those who elected him. His words are a scham, a lie, his presence in cong an insult to good American tax payers!

9354 2018-02-22 18:03:19 I think the answer to no more school shootings is no more school. That way you have to homeschool your might be psycho kid and can catch onto their gun buying habits early on.

9360 2018-02-22 18:03:03 (2/3)  If a tie in bobsleigh (where things are measured by 100ths of a second) deserves 2 gold medals....so does a tie in any other sport.....It's not like they make the bobsledders do another run with only one person on-board....
9361 2018-02-22 18:03:01 @JohnMartin929 the women’s Cross Country Team Gold Medal was awesome too
9362 2018-02-22 18:02:58 Don't take CAG reports too seriously. Mostly they do not take into account all replies and particularly the final reply or explanation before publishing the PARA.There can be two views on gold imports even in normal times. If order was
so blatantly wrong new Govt should rescind.

9364 2018-02-22 18:02:54 You’re deciding who wins the gold medal based on a skills competition. I’d rather see it be decided with actual hockey. It’s like deciding who wins the Cup in a shootout
9365 2018-02-22 18:02:52 Lmaooooo that video was gold
9366 2018-02-22 18:02:52 It's a true statement.  Crying white mothers are indeed media gold.
9367 2018-02-22 18:02:51 After winning 4 gold medals in a row, it was inevitable that 1 day we weren't going to win in women's #hockey.  Also, the world caught up in curling thanks to Canadian coaching.  But I'm still proud of our athletes.  Hold your head up high, you're amazing! #Olympics #TeamCanada
9368 2018-02-22 18:02:50 IIRC the Notre Dame leprechaun also stores his pot of gold there too.
9369 2018-02-22 18:02:49 Elites? RWers love this word. Look around. Their greedy leader has a gold toilet
9370 2018-02-22 18:02:48 I’m more of mens hockey fan than womans hockey, perhaps we will play USA in the mens gold final... oh wait! You guys didnt make it! Sorry!
9371 2018-02-22 18:02:45 here is NRA’s come from “Many in legacy media love mass shootings,” Loesch said after walking on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference to a standing ovation. “I’m not saying you love the tragedy, but you love the ratings.

9383 2018-02-22 18:02:17 When u tell me to jump I get the Olympic gold medalist so I can get u as high a jump as possible

9386 2018-02-22 18:02:16 If you get gold you're over the moon, if you get bronze you're happy for making it but if you get silver all you can think its "I could have gotten gold if only I was a bit better/faster". Jocelyne Larocque took off her silver medal right away...she's human and has emotions too.
9387 2018-02-22 18:02:14 Congratulations to the @usahockey woman’s team!! By the way where is your gold medal and where is your Stanley Cup you don’t have any ha ha and stop talking shit about Patrick Marleau!!

9419 2018-02-22 18:00:59 Really? Wow. Bitter much? If they were so inferior they wouldn't have even gotten to a shootout. And that silver badge of shame was earned by eliminating how many other teams to get to the gold match?
9420 2018-02-22 18:00:58 Yes Ladies @HC_Women you're all Solid  Gold to us... also @JustinTrudeau more funding for girls hockey/televised women's matches please!! Demand is there...
9421 2018-02-22 18:00:55 @XboxSupport the prices in the Xbox live gold deals are not showing the discounts properly when you go to buy. I tried logging out and restarting my Xbox one x. Even tried the Xbox app.
9422 2018-02-22 18:00:55 If Jocelyn LaRocque wants to win gold, perhaps she should learn to play hockey. Miserable cow.
9423 2018-02-22 18:00:51 It took me a while to like GJ when he joined at the gardens... only because @RogerWilson8 left for him to come in , but when I got over that... I realised he’s ace! Miss him running around in the green, black and gold!
9424 2018-02-22 18:00:48 Congrats to the U.S. women's hockey team for taking gold!!

9426 2018-02-22 18:00:43 I 've an incredible collection of lipglosses...YSL created one with gold 24k inside...and couldn't i try them all??? Yessssssssss
9427 2018-02-22 18:00:42 ‘Cause darling without you
All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the nightsky
Will never be enough
Never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but it'll never be enough
9428 2018-02-22 18:00:41 So very proud of these young women. They  are the Spirit of America. Very exciting game they deserve the GOLD. Congratulations you make AMERICANS proud. JUST LOVE YOUR SPIRIT.
9429 2018-02-22 18:00:41 Gold medals, yes.  Total medals, no.
9430 2018-02-22 18:00:40 نعم قد يحسدك البعض على قدرتك على التصالح مع نفسك و الحياة و الأقدار!!
9431 2018-02-22 18:00:40 Yeah, Gold on White reminds me of a Dentist's Mercedes who is trying to be hip and show that he makes decent money. Black on Gold is pretty hot though.
9432 2018-02-22 18:00:39 K so I may not have played hockey after high school but I did play against 2 olympic gold medalists so I'm taking that as my biggest accomplishment

9436 2018-02-22 18:00:37 Stayed up all night watching the girls take home gold   but I’m definitely feeling the sleep deprivation kicking in as I’m only half way through shift #1 today 
9437 2018-02-22 18:00:37 Now playing #Council - Rust to Gold on three clock hours FM
9438 2018-02-22 18:00:37 You are missing the point. If you don’t know what you did wrong. You can’t fix it. So everyone gets 100’s & Gold Stars Everyday. What about the ones acting out to get attention? What if the teacher ignores them, instead of giving them Firm love? Still the school goes kaboom
9439 2018-02-22 18:00:30 Congratulations to @HilaryKnight and @usahockey on #GOLD #goldenKnight We are so proud and inspired by your performance. #USA #USA #USA
9440 2018-02-22 18:00:29 That’s our first look at Jonah in green and gold! Looks great! Thank you!
9441 2018-02-22 18:00:26 The best part of #Olympics2018 has been @CBCOlympics adding @Craig_McMorris to the panel. What an absolute gem. Give him at least 3 gold medals. What other commentator is dropping DMX quotes. None.
9442 2018-02-22 18:00:25 That didn't take as long as I thought it would. Figured they would wait at least a month before claiming the pot of gold.
9443 2018-02-22 18:00:23 Do I know anyone that plays GW2 that can toss me like, 3 gold lmao
9444 2018-02-22 18:00:22 My gold short is back in with stop at entry
9445 2018-02-22 18:00:20 I'm still smiling knowing that @NBCOlympics chose to bench their multi-million $ anchors to cover #closingceremony , because they knew the ratings gold would be you, @taralipinski  and your buddy @terrygannon83 . #PyeongChang2018
9446 2018-02-22 18:00:17 @jimrome Team Canada silver medal womens hockey team seen this morning....mumbling "Let's play some basketball!" #USA GOLD
9447 2018-02-22 18:00:16 @jimrome if the Stanley Cup goes 7 games and it's a tie its decided in shootout, why change it for the Gold?

Thats just Hockey.
9448 2018-02-22 18:00:14 I KNOW! ESPECIALLY in light of how they behaved after they won gold 4 years ago. I love me some Canada but why did they choose 6 graders for the hockey team?
9449 2018-02-22 18:00:13 I'll be up to watch the gold-medal game! Go-Go #teamusa #USAmenscurling @USAcurl

9455 2018-02-22 18:00:08 Shout out David Wise for bringing home the Gold medal back to Reno! 
Also repping Moments which are based out of Reno as well!
9456 2018-02-22 18:00:06 I was looking at a few HP models but they say they’re ‘gold’ in the top description but the spec says ‘silk gold’. And my last trip to my local store only had the HP Pavillion 14-bk152sa 14” laptop on display
9457 2018-02-22 18:00:04 Congrats to the Women's USA Hockey Team for bringing home the gold!!! 
9458 2018-02-22 18:00:03 My single status just went Gold.
9459 2018-02-22 18:00:03 Reminds me of when we were throwing a box over a fence in Miami outside space and gold rush, cops were not happy

9464 2018-02-22 17:59:51 I forgot the exact quote but it's like "silver is first place for losers." Anything that isn't gold is a loss. I think that's what they're trying to say.
9465 2018-02-22 17:59:51 The Koreans ROBBED the gold. They should get penalty but didn't. Soooooo unfair.
9466 2018-02-22 17:59:50 My lunch today consisted of a smuckers uncrustable, gold fish and cosmic brownie. I feel like this is 99’ and I am 5 not 2018 and I am 23
9467 2018-02-22 17:59:50 The purple and gold will start selling again
9468 2018-02-22 17:59:49 You’re so funny x where did u come up with that comedy gold x
9469 2018-02-22 17:59:45 have gold circle ticket prices been increased from previous years? i don’t need specifics, just need to know that. please
9470 2018-02-22 17:59:41 I’d win the gold for my twist reverse cowgirl dismount while keeping my legs together.

9472 2018-02-22 17:59:40 What is ratings gold is watching the complete melt down of the NRA in real time. Quaking in their boots with fear of the new generation of voters. 4 million of them this year alone not to mention last years 18 year olds. And the ones that will 18 by 2020.
9473 2018-02-22 17:59:38 Only third period and overtime...at least they had shootout opportunities.
Great game..'
SILVER IS WONDERFUL..!
Don't let media shit on you...for not getting Gold.
PROUD OF ALL...
9474 2018-02-22 17:59:36 Canadians to Americans today: It only took you 21 years, Tims is better than Dunkins. Our beer is better. Our health care is better, our school children are safer (we don't need metal detectors at every door). We still have more medals than you but enjoy that hockey gold for now.
9475 2018-02-22 17:59:36 Yeah I said it before the shootout happened. I've said it for many years a shootout to decide a gold medal is stupid in a sport like hockey especially.

9482 2018-02-22 17:59:30 First gold medal ever in the Winter Olympics for Hungary?? And they qualified for the Olympics in last place.  I love these stories that play out at the games  #PyeongChang2018 #shorttrack #5000mrelay
9483 2018-02-22 17:59:29 Hockey in general would be a good start, but this gold medal will hopefully help the ladies even more.
9484 2018-02-22 17:59:27 Hey, USA Sportscasters... I don't think anyone would describe 6 rounds of shootouts to decide a Gold medal hockey game as *Thrilling*!! 
9485 2018-02-22 17:59:27 The priesthood of the religious right preaches and worships their trinity of gold, guns and the “good ole days”.
9486 2018-02-22 17:59:22 If you were trying to be an international embarrasment. Bravo. You get a gold medal.

9490 2018-02-22 17:59:13 to me its a difference between gold teeth and a grill but i could be wrong
9491 2018-02-22 17:59:12 Tessa Virtue, Scott Moir, Charles Hamelin & Lindsay Vonn have ended their Olympic careers in style. #Gold #Bronze #PyeongChang2018 #Canada #USA

9492 2018-02-22 17:59:12 Congratulations from all of us @ Erie county highway on your GOLD MEDAL !!!!!!@EmilyPfalzer
9493 2018-02-22 17:59:06 all this Raptors contender talk is pointless until the playoffs arrive. I’ve been calling them a Fools Gold team all season
9494 2018-02-22 17:58:59 I wonder if you are upset at NRA spokeswoman saying crying white mothers are ratings gold 
9495 2018-02-22 17:58:55 Yeah but now I can’t listen to @prednecknation from this morning while I write about the USA Gold Medal Game last night
9496 2018-02-22 17:58:54 It doesn't matter what medals we get from now on since we didn't win gold in women's ice hockey
9497 2018-02-22 17:58:51 Revenge is a dish best served gold
9498 2018-02-22 17:58:46 I was watching women's hockey last night. Congrats on team USA for winning gold medal. Close game but it was worth to watch.
9499 2018-02-22 17:58:45 Can you believe it, the two most recent Team USA gold are due to shootouts lol. It’s pathetic.
9500 2018-02-22 17:58:40 I’m WEEPING this is GOLD.
9501 2018-02-22 17:58:38 Memory of a gold fish
9502 2018-02-22 17:58:36 She already has a gold ... she'll be fine.
9503 2018-02-22 17:58:29 I can't believe I gave up on our girls and turned the TV off and didn't watch #USA hockey win GOLD! Congrats ladies, way to represent. 
9504 2018-02-22 17:58:25 اللهم اجعلنا ممن يُقال لهم "هذه الجنة التي كنتم بها تُوعدون"
9505 2018-02-22 17:58:21 Now get ready for all the hubbub surrounding the US women finally winning the gold in Olympic hockey. Like we still haven’t heard enough about something that happened 38 years ago. This one will stretch into the next millennium.
9506 2018-02-22 17:58:20 Tell him his podcast with SDCC yesterday was absolute gold. Came across brilliantly
9507 2018-02-22 17:58:18 Reading this morning's @SportingGreenSF: Olympics coverage: badass women winning gold. Rest of green section: women don't exist. #WomenInSport #genderavenger #Olympicwomen

9511 2018-02-22 17:58:10 Thanks for organizing all of this! You, katlyn and the renew website developer should get the gold in the olympics of the renew campaign!
9512 2018-02-22 17:58:09 Gold Star/Walton Street forecast in the last. 
9513 2018-02-22 17:58:04 It’s not about playoff success. It’s about winning gold on a stacked Olympic team, character, leadership and intangibles.
9514 2018-02-22 17:58:03 This response deserves a gold medal: 
9515 2018-02-22 17:58:03 Pecunio has closed pre-sale hard cap and team is preparing for main sale. Get your save and 100% stable coin which is based on gold price. I have no doubt that Pecunio will sell all tokens. #PECUNIO #Crypto #Blockchain #ICO #Profit #invest
9516 2018-02-22 17:57:59 Good luck to our Captain Jason Gold '18 at Lehigh this weekend for wrestling Nationals! #gobrooks
9517 2018-02-22 17:57:58 besides being beyond disgusting what exactly is LEGACY media? And why hasn't anyone pointed out her "crying white mothers is ratings gold" as inherently racist to boot?
9518 2018-02-22 17:57:56 This is gold
9519 2018-02-22 17:57:51 Yeah it’s still all white though, no one will see the gold on highlights or TV. Got to be red stay safe

9532 2018-02-22 17:57:19 What about the major Olympic “upset” last night, USA’s first gold in women’s hockey since 1998! Because my girls won  or why Tomas Hyka is my new star!
9533 2018-02-22 17:57:17 My daughter is doing math homework,  she asked if I knew anything about angles.  I said I know @RealKurtAngle won an Olympic gold medal,  WITH A BROKEN FRICKIN NECK

9535 2018-02-22 17:57:14 Yes last winter was far better wrt air frost, especially January vs January. Makes it even more important we strike gold with the snow risk!

9546 2018-02-22 17:56:57 Lol just lovin the reaction. Manage beating Canada for gold and you'd think they put another fuckin man on the moon ha
9547 2018-02-22 17:56:55 It all depends on the rosters. If USA hockey actually put together the best roster, not that pile of poop that was the world cup team, they could of given Canada a run for their money for gold
9548 2018-02-22 17:56:49 Gold fizzog! Dah-nah, nah! He's the man, the man with the shiny bonce!

9550 2018-02-22 17:56:46 Good grief folks - her team lost a gold medal, she was not there to win silver.  Cut her some slack.  I am sure most of these athletes are A types whose desire and drive to win is off the charts
9551 2018-02-22 17:56:45 كم تبرعت الشعوب العربية والإسلامية بالأموال للشعوب التي تعاني حرباً وفقرا  ولم نرى هذه الأموال أين ذهبت. أما الشعوب المضطهده فقد ماتت جوعا. وأما التبرعات اختفت عند العاملين عليها.. وصار المسكين مصدر ثراء للعاملين على تلك التبرعات

9555 2018-02-22 17:56:35 I literally have to push myself every morning to get out of bed and get ready for school. Pushing myself to get though the day filled with people I hate is even harder. Like imagine pushing dead weight all day. I’m so strong. Where is my Gold Medal?
9556 2018-02-22 17:56:35 Me :)
9557 2018-02-22 17:56:34 Seriously they had a skills competition decide who wins gold #USAvsCAN #Olympics
9558 2018-02-22 17:56:34 IF YOURE DONATING BLOOD, DONT LET THE GUY WITH THE GOLD TOOTH TAKE YOUR BLOOD OR INFORMATION!!! HE IS SLEEP DEPRIVED, HE FELL ASLEEP WHILE I WAS GIVIG HIM MY INFO MULTIPLE TIMES & WROTE DOWN ALMOST EVERYTHING WRONG. IF HE CANT PUT DOWN SIMPLE INFO, CAN HE REALLY GET UR BLOOD?
9559 2018-02-22 17:56:32 That's not true. If Korea won the silver I'm sure they would celebrate. Canada expected gold and were clearly disappointed.

#AldiMum 

has been to give us the best she can in life and she hasnt had a lofe for herself because of that, she always makes sure everyone is looked after, she has a heart of gold and would give someone her last if she thought they needed it more than her,
9561 2018-02-22 17:56:32 Thinking about permanents real hard rn. Do I want gold in my mouth for the next 5 years atleast ? /:
9562 2018-02-22 17:56:30 USA women hockey gold medal!! Woooo
9563 2018-02-22 17:56:30 Every time I look at this necklace you gave me , it makes me wonder why you dint buy the gold ones instead . They looked way cooler
9564 2018-02-22 17:56:28 @ourzoniaprod1 HUNGARY  FOR GOLD MEN'S SHORT TRACK! WE ARE SO HAPPY 4 U! CONGRATS ON YOUR FIRST EVER GOLD MEDAL IN WINTER OLYMPICS! AND WITH A OLYMPIC  RECORD TOO!

9566 2018-02-22 17:56:27 yEAH the gold one!! 
REALLY ?!? how much would you want for it?? :0

9570 2018-02-22 17:56:18 @CharlieKipp when are they bringing out the sweepers for gold medal curling?
9571 2018-02-22 17:56:14 well one is based on a gold or copper conductor, the other based on a direct silicon solution. Semi conductors are the only thing that conducts better then gold. If you want to go faster you need graphite
9572 2018-02-22 17:56:10 Yee but I'm not gonna pass up a possible Gold AR
9573 2018-02-22 17:56:08 we're different
like an orb effect 
our attitude isn't close enough
i like simple things 
you like fancy rings 
im just a piece of copper 
and you are mixed of gold and silver
i dont know how to achieve the best
but i can do my best 
i should rest right now---
9574 2018-02-22 17:56:05 Carbon dioxide is not safe, in any form...

The diamonds expire as they dissolve...  Diamonds have a half life...  And it is, a disturbing one...  The half life of gold, is disturbing as well...
9575 2018-02-22 17:56:01 @buffaloroad22 Congratulations to the US Woman’s Olympic Hockey Team for bringing home the GOLD. It was a breath taking WIN!
9576 2018-02-22 17:55:59 I have 2if you're still looking for tickets
9577 2018-02-22 17:55:59 Not knowing how fucked up it really is over here...everything that glitters ain’t gold pimp
9578 2018-02-22 17:55:56 If Salah gets a new 85 rated gold card, his POTM card will likely get at least +1 upgrade.
9579 2018-02-22 17:55:55 @maddie_rooney35 Nice Saves! :D Congrats on Gold :)
9580 2018-02-22 17:55:53 the cast of Parks and Rec shitting on the NRA for using a gif of Leslie Knope is honestly pure gold.

9582 2018-02-22 17:55:49 THE GOLD HOOPS YESS
9583 2018-02-22 17:55:46 Thoughts on yet again, another gold medal decided by a shootout. After quite an excited game.
9584 2018-02-22 17:55:45 3 Gatsu no Lion is such a great live action! Kamiki's acting is gold as always!!  Seriously, Kamiki is precious, an adorable man and awesome professional!

9586 2018-02-22 17:55:42 Wow. It really is the new gold.
9587 2018-02-22 17:55:35 While it wasn’t the miracle on ice, the U.S. women’s hockey team pulled off a damn awesome victory against the northern red army of Canada, only the victory actually won a . #USAvsCAN #lemoreax #Gold

9590 2018-02-22 17:55:29 Canada be like damn we lost the gold medal but at least we don’t have Trump

9592 2018-02-22 17:55:24 Totally earned the gold !! Well played ladies

9599 2018-02-22 17:55:20 Og Asians always got some fresh gold chains
9600 2018-02-22 17:55:18 Cause we lit lmao
9601 2018-02-22 17:55:17 Because Americans are the gold standard for sportsmanship, right?
9602 2018-02-22 17:55:14 Remember everyone. You win the gold in a tournament like this and you win bronze. But you lose for silver. She didn't throw it. She just displayed her disappointment quietly. No taking away from USA and their win but a shootout is ridiculous at this level.
9603 2018-02-22 17:55:11 As  as it was for  women to lose hockey gold today you just gotta give the  ladies huge kudos for an awesome game and they deserve a . Hockey is hockey and that’s how the puck drops. 
9604 2018-02-22 17:55:07 "Crying white mothers are ratings gold"?! WTF?!?!?!
9605 2018-02-22 17:55:05 Good Luck and bring home the gold!
9606 2018-02-22 17:55:03 com 10 reais podemos negociar uma colombian gold entao.. pren o orçamento eh mais baixo, cerca de 3,50 a 4 reais.
9607 2018-02-22 17:55:02 Honey, honey, di lang ikaw ang stressed. Alam kong studyante lang ako at ikaw nagtatrabaho na pero napakaunprofessional po yun pagdump ng stress o pagpilit na kami nalang manuod. Tbh naman you can’t really pass off shit as gold so don’t blame us for not selling it as such gahhhh

9610 2018-02-22 17:54:56 You deserve a gold ass star
9611 2018-02-22 17:54:55 Nothing less then gold, make us look great

9614 2018-02-22 17:54:49 wow watching Liu Shaolin win Hungary's first gold was something to see
9615 2018-02-22 17:54:48 AMANDA KESSEL IS A OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST
9616 2018-02-22 17:54:47 If you ever see my child’s diaper and feel like judging me please consider I put it on her while she was being an Olympic gold medalist inchworm
9617 2018-02-22 17:54:47 Note: I still don't have these mounts. Because I'm far to focused on story and stuff to actually play the AH to actually make millions of gold.
9618 2018-02-22 17:54:46 heart of gold
9619 2018-02-22 17:54:43 Why are all these girls trying to gold dig on me??? I hate it.
9620 2018-02-22 17:54:40 I love it.  The Canadian will be back stronger and ready to win gold for another 20 yrs
9621 2018-02-22 17:54:39 When your philosophy professor comes in and automatically starts talking  to you about the Gold Medal game 
9622 2018-02-22 17:54:38 USA Men's Curling beat Canada to go to the Gold Medal Game for the first time ever. It guarantees at least a silver. Suck it Canada! #USA #USA #USA #USAvsCAN
9623 2018-02-22 17:54:38 Feel free, go for gold.
9624 2018-02-22 17:54:35 Hopefully, the silver lining in this Trump shitcloud will be refining the gold as we burn the chaff. We need to punish bad faith argumentation in politics. All sides need to value facts and not pursue spin. We agree on more than we disagree on. Except for Yankees fans. Fuck them.
9625 2018-02-22 17:54:31 Well I just saw a grandstand finish in #ShortTrack as #HUN wins their first #Gold medal in the discipline and their first medal since 1980. What a way to close out short track at #PyongChang2018

9627 2018-02-22 17:54:30 It’s the morning after the Olympics. I’m still hyped as hell for our women’s team bringing home Gold. Expect no less than more happiness and hyping them up today.

9632 2018-02-22 17:54:21 Yes, 100% and thanks for bringing it up. The gold medal game in women's hockey is the PINNACLE of the sport. Competitiveness isn't binary, there are degrees of it. No doubt, Jocelyne is in the 1%.
9633 2018-02-22 17:54:21 58 IIRC. Gold miniature crown and gold large crown for every monster except Zorah since he's a fixed size. It's insane.
9634 2018-02-22 17:54:16 I have  Two:)
9635 2018-02-22 17:54:15 No need to be a buzz kill. The game was awesome and the USA women finally got the Gold Medal again. USA and Canada never disappoint...
9636 2018-02-22 17:54:13 ﴿ رَبِّ إِنِّى ظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِى فَٱغْفِرْ لِى ﴾
9637 2018-02-22 17:54:12 Akşama Tuborg Gold ile başlayıp.. sırasıyla Carlsberg, Kronenbourg Blanc ve kapanış Weihenstephan ile.. daha güzel gecelerim oldu ama bu da iyiydi..
9638 2018-02-22 17:54:10 We like you fine. 

Somebody other than us had to win a gold medal to keep interest up. 

Glad it was you folks. 

We will now return to our regular scheduled dominance. 
9639 2018-02-22 17:54:10 Very selfish!
I would have loved just to be there for the experience! She won a gold in Russia 4 years ago and silver now. It’s the honor of being there! #sad #uncanadian
9640 2018-02-22 17:54:09 I’d drop a gold scar for any1 of my boys.
9641 2018-02-22 17:54:07 If I hear one more time “I thought you were gonna be rude when I first saw you.” Honestly, Im a very open person and have a heart of gold !

9643 2018-02-22 17:54:04 @jimrome what's better? Being a fatty with a gold medal or a skinny loser? #USA
9644 2018-02-22 17:53:54 I still haven't forgotten about Poulin getting off scot free for headshotting Duggan in the Gold Medal Game. a win doesn't change that.
9645 2018-02-22 17:53:54 That's seems rather ridiculous. Too much gold in the economy? Time to start raising prices of the Exotic Mounts from Mei Francis. That 20k mount? more like 200k mount. Which is still chump change to people that play the AH.
9646 2018-02-22 17:53:53 Heartbreaking! A gold medal game should never end in a shootout. That being said, the US deserved the win after that OT.
9647 2018-02-22 17:53:50 You’re willing to accept a claim that you admit you can’t confirm until after you die?

Is it unreasonable to reject conclusions that can’t be confirmed?

That’s all we’re doing.
9648 2018-02-22 17:53:49 Edge of your seat great !!! #USA # GOLD
9649 2018-02-22 17:53:48 Is it that the Kessel family now has 2 cups and a gold medal?
9650 2018-02-22 17:53:48 Dana Loesch 2/21: “I’m sorry for your loss” to a crying white mother at #CNNTownHall 

Dana Loesch 2/22: “crying white mothers are ratings gold” at #CPAC2018 

This is what pure evil look like, folks.
9651 2018-02-22 17:53:47 Yeah his selection with Gameiro was not great. Griezman rare gold is a better card and cheaper.
9652 2018-02-22 17:53:45 our women’s USA hockey team won gold last night fuck Canada
9653 2018-02-22 17:53:39 best part about the women not winning gold is everyone agreeing the shootout is a piss way to win it.

9655 2018-02-22 17:53:38 Yea Hungary in their first Gold metal for speed skating!!!!
9656 2018-02-22 17:53:38 Opinions, I do like the gold but its got nothing to do with posh for me.
9657 2018-02-22 17:53:37 1000 isn’t a lot either. I just drop to 900 after doing gold tokens set
9658 2018-02-22 17:53:37 Sidney Crosby on @AmandaKessel8 winning gold with Team #USA: "It's great for her. I know they've had some tough finals over the years. I'm sure Phil was up watching it just like everyone else. She's been through a lot, so it's nice to see her get rewarded." @937theFan #Pens
9659 2018-02-22 17:53:36 This tweet is gold
9660 2018-02-22 17:53:33 She is a true athlete, seems genuine, and I love her spirit, CONGRATULATIONS on your Gold medal.

9664 2018-02-22 17:53:27 well the only reason we have latencies is because IF is too slow. The bandwidth and frequency simply isnt possible to ramp up enough to match on die speed. But EMIB is basically a extention of silicon. Simply a superior conductor to the in-plane gold or copper used with IF
9665 2018-02-22 17:53:26 Arre yeh to kuch nahi..... Italian mafia Girl actually robbed revered gold and artifacts and smuggled to Italy in 80s and 90s.... Any bells ringing jhantu ji

9671 2018-02-22 17:53:15 yes, Mertens will likely get a new gold card rated 87, and all his IF will receive +1 upgrade, changing his 89->90
9672 2018-02-22 17:53:13 The breakup of Otokogumi. Akina Nakamori and the gold byobu. I don't know if you'll find anything in English, but those are examples of what Mary has done. Odds are, there's probably more.
9673 2018-02-22 17:53:12 So proud of this team. A shootout does not belong in a gold medal game. Yes I’d be saying that if  won as well. Been saying it for years. Imagine game 7 of the Stanley Cup going to a shootout. Sounds ridiculous right?
9674 2018-02-22 17:53:08 Mean Kitty Is now playing Gold by Spandau Ballet!
9675 2018-02-22 17:53:08 Headline may as well read "Massive racist and racist gold digger out themselves as racists"

9677 2018-02-22 17:53:01 Equities outperformed gold.

9679 2018-02-22 17:52:56 Congrats on the gold and silver medals. You are awesome.
9680 2018-02-22 17:52:56 Phil said he talked to Amanda before and after the Gold Medal Game. "I think she can’t believe it. You know, the girls work so hard to get there and it’s every four years, and that’s the biggest game they get a chance to play in. It’s a great accomplishment." -MC

9682 2018-02-22 17:52:54 Look inside of my soul and u can find gold and maybe get rich
9683 2018-02-22 17:52:54 Unbelievably proud of the National Women's Team.  Tough way to settle a final but the inspiration these women will pass on to the next generation is worth its weight in gold.  Hard to hear now, but they are heroes at home!
9684 2018-02-22 17:52:52 And let me know whoes giving away free Gold platters dude so I can go get it  lol
9685 2018-02-22 17:52:51 You think you can fight the government? You're 5'7" 340 lbs and just had a whole bucket of rotisserie gold and you think you and your Wal-Mart militia is gonna take on some navy seals??

9687 2018-02-22 17:52:50 Thank you for your loyalty to the blue and gold!  I’m so sad to know you won’t be returning and wish you much success in your future endeavours!
9688 2018-02-22 17:52:49 Sullivan on the gold medal game: "I was thrilled for them. As an American, we're proud of them. They're really good players. They work extremely hard for the opportunity to compete in the Olympics. And they're a really good team."
9689 2018-02-22 17:52:43 Congratulations to the #USA women's hockey team on their gold!!!!!!!! 
9690 2018-02-22 17:52:43 Hey guys.... it's okay to just enjoy the USA winning the Gold and be happy for the women and all the hard work they put in. 

We don't have to turn this into an argument. It's not mandatory.
9691 2018-02-22 17:52:42 I forgot to mention, we did ask Murray Gold about the s9 soundtrack and he said he's working on it.  So everyone who said the delay was caused by him was correct.  I don't understand that but it's a fact.  Maybe now that he's not working on s11, he'll devote more time to it.
9692 2018-02-22 17:52:42 Absolute gold every time I stumble upon it
9693 2018-02-22 17:52:39 In college, a grown adult and can't clean up your messes. I hate people.
9694 2018-02-22 17:52:34 perdi a tampa do meu batom da Austrálian gold muito chateada
9695 2018-02-22 17:52:33 Y'all gotta watch Chris Rock new shit on Netflix. It's gold .
9696 2018-02-22 17:52:32 I want it all; money, fast cars, Diamond rings, gold chains and champagne I want it all, all, all, all 
9697 2018-02-22 17:52:32 You got the gold in hockey, potential gold in curling, for Canada's sake could you bring home the gold in gun policy? Guns don't belong in schools. Regulate and enforce control measures and vetting programs. #GunReformNow
9698 2018-02-22 17:52:31 Love seeing all these #hapa athletes compete— especially the Chinese-Hungarian brothers that brought Hungary their first gold medal in the #WinterOlympics #mixedpeople #representation

9700 2018-02-22 17:52:28 @TomFarrey enjoyed your take on athlete development today on the Olympic channel.  USA v Norway systems. I have a ton to say on the subject if you'd like to talk. I coached the USA to our first gold in NC, spent a ton of time in Scandinavia. Might be fun! Let me know
9701 2018-02-22 17:52:28 No white and gold looks lovely
9702 2018-02-22 17:52:26 ｜o - o) 今なにか…
9703 2018-02-22 17:52:23 Make it so when you enter a game you’re dropped from a weird bus and have to skydive down and pick up your players, maybe add the idea of getting better players in a gold chest or something? Seems like it would be a good addition
9704 2018-02-22 17:52:20 Difficult to separate the art & artist, the product & producer. Used to love the Cosby show as a kid but can’t watch it now. Watched the beautiful film Woman in Gold on Netflix on the wknd & my heart sank when I saw Weinstein company in the credits. @CBCOntarioToday

9706 2018-02-22 17:52:17 @TeamKnowhowUK I’ve been looking online for a laptop that can be bought in the gold colour but the pictures on the website make them all seem silver. Only the chromebook and ASUS VivoBook look gold
9707 2018-02-22 17:52:16 The gold medal should go to the Olympian you most want to have a beer with.
9708 2018-02-22 17:52:13 The Gold Standard.
9709 2018-02-22 17:52:11 Crying mothers and children are also policy gold and hopefully the impetus for actual change.
9710 2018-02-22 17:52:09  legends of rock put me on to some gold
9711 2018-02-22 17:52:08 cheers philip, gold star look tough here...
9712 2018-02-22 17:52:08 Like momma would say “Everything that glitters is not gold”
9713 2018-02-22 17:52:07 NanoSprayer "feiner Sprühnebel trocknet den Kleber viel schneller". Farbe gold
9714 2018-02-22 17:52:06 Congrats to the US Women’s Hockey Team for breaking the curse and bringing home the Gold!  An amazing game to watch! #OOPSIDIDITAGAIN #USA #OlympicGames2018
9715 2018-02-22 17:52:05 Maybe can f***k a Saudi sheik so she can buy a gold one
9716 2018-02-22 17:52:04 Just search Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 on Google with the color of Gold & tell me, is it beautiful?
9717 2018-02-22 17:52:04 My adopted country, the Czech Republic (I am moving there next month), will win gold, I hope.
9718 2018-02-22 17:52:02 Man I just wanna go flex, gold on my teeth and on my neck
9719 2018-02-22 17:51:54 I see the Gold/Silver starters are quite high while the RBGY starters are right in the middle. A fair assessment.
9720 2018-02-22 17:51:52 #USAvsCAN Just watched the tivo. What a game. Congrats #usawomenshockey #@maddie_rooney35 gold save!!!! YYYEEESSSS

9722 2018-02-22 17:51:50 Autoverkehr unattraktiv gestalten....schon klar aus welchem Gedankengut das kommt. Besser wäre es doch wohl ÖPNV attraktiver geatalten damit die Leute aus Überzeugung umsteigen und nicht aufgrund Verboten
9723 2018-02-22 17:51:50 Truly the country that almost won five olympic gold medals in a row was the real underdog.
9724 2018-02-22 17:51:49 "Day into night, sugar into salt, living to death, and dark blue into gold. thats what makes a Trancy Butler" - Claude Faustus
9725 2018-02-22 17:51:47 With Olympians like @ElizabethSwaney it’s no wonder Hungary only just won their first ever gold medal
9726 2018-02-22 17:51:47 I understand why they're not viable products but I would absolutely buy gold bordered cube products of my favorite draft environments.
9727 2018-02-22 17:51:45 今日も夜更かしで草

9729 2018-02-22 17:51:43 Not his to use. What an arrogant prick. To risk the future savings of Aussie’s for another country’s ? benefit. @TurnbullMalcolm your #GREED has no limits, your stupidity, same You truly are trying to destroy our country, WHY? Howard wasting our Gold reserves, now this. #ENOUGH
9730 2018-02-22 17:51:42 Ken Morrow, on the heels of the Gold Medal victory, joined the Islanders for their 4 straight #StanleyCup victories. Not too shabby.
9731 2018-02-22 17:51:39 "Crying white widows are ratings gold!!"
9732 2018-02-22 17:51:38 You’re not making any sense. If i lost in the gold medal game i wouldn’t care to have the medal or not because i lost. I wouldn’t want a medal for fucking losing
9733 2018-02-22 17:51:34 When’s the gold medal game?

9736 2018-02-22 17:51:22 Michelle Kwan will always be my favorite skater and yes, I think she was robbed of the gold in 98 because of the 3/3 TL did. I'd much rather watch more Michelle's, than the jumpers of today. Grace, artistry and performance is a lost art.
9737 2018-02-22 17:51:22 That's not a gold tooth... That's a corn kernel 
9738 2018-02-22 17:51:21 you don’t win silver, you lose gold 
9739 2018-02-22 17:51:21 I think the kid that lives below me is legitimately from a different time period. He wears short shorts and gold necklaces everyday without irony.
9740 2018-02-22 17:51:19 @jimrome just like the Stanley Cup the hockey gold medal is where it belongs the USA.
9741 2018-02-22 17:51:12 Except for the transparent ideology, this is a meaningless statement.
9742 2018-02-22 17:51:12 Wow well please lets get you to korea to play for a gold medal on saturday
9743 2018-02-22 17:51:08 Me, watching this short track relay race: I guess I'll root for Canada? I dunno.
The announcer: Can Hungary win their first-ever gold medal at a Winter #Olympics?
Me: TEAM HUNGARY NOW AND FOREVER I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED HUNGARY AND I ALWAYS WILL
9744 2018-02-22 17:51:06 Hmm...my guy
9745 2018-02-22 17:51:06 @mOneyMakinNique you got anymore hard copies of Guyana Gold ? I played mine till it would play anymore.
9746 2018-02-22 17:51:05 lol  Well that tweet got that Gold.  I imagine the first time would be just like that.  Like everything, it probably slows down a bit once you get the hang of it.
9747 2018-02-22 17:51:05 how wonderful for the Kessel family...an Olympic Gold & Stanley Cup all within a year!!! Congratulations!!
9748 2018-02-22 17:51:04 Gold for US in Womens Hockey.
Gold for Hungary in short track.
Great fun

9752 2018-02-22 17:51:01 @jimrome that call from Steve in Vancouver certainly wasn't gold medal worthy. Not even silver medal level. Hell that call was ejected from the game.
9753 2018-02-22 17:51:00 man just wtf ? fight for the true and ask your gold AR just go on .... its unfair
9754 2018-02-22 17:50:59 His mentions are gold today. Someone told him he musta heard how old Shuri was.

Can't wait to return! Gonna love my Gold headset for movies too!

9774 2018-02-22 17:50:14 Is that the gold one?
9775 2018-02-22 17:50:11 Great win for them but Gold Medals should not be decided by shootout.
9776 2018-02-22 17:50:10 Phil Kessel on Amanda winning gold: "I’m very proud of her. She missed a lot of time with her concussion and stuff. To be able to win a gold medal, it’s a special accomplishment and I’m really proud of her." -MC
9777 2018-02-22 17:50:08 It’s crazy that people still listen to people like Peter Schiff and the like. The world is going to explode!!! Now buy some of my gold....
9778 2018-02-22 17:50:07 question here calum is whether to go in further here on the legendary sbs not won all day angle on gold star and huge future @calumswanlaw gold star odds not very appealing

9783 2018-02-22 17:49:51 I understand the extreme disappointment in yourself. Nobody wins silver. You win gold. Often bronze feels better because you compete for that as well. BUT athletes at this level have competed enough to know how to be a gracious winner and how to accept loss. #growup
9784 2018-02-22 17:49:48 #NRA accuses media of chasing ratings gold in wake of #ParklandShooting, unlike @waynelapierrejr who is chasing actual gold---out fundraising more #NRABloodMoney to spend to protect gun manufacturers' profits. #Resist the #lies of NRA and #ComplicitGOP

9786 2018-02-22 17:49:42 The three top win a medal. Gold, Silver and Bronze. After that no one gets a participation trophy. She knew that coming in.  She got beat. Deal with it and don’t disrespect the integrity and tradition of the games.

9788 2018-02-22 17:49:40 I don't think it was disrespectful at all. As an American I'm glad the US won the gold but these athletes train for years and to come up short it has to be heartbreaking. Kudos to that Canadian player, for she has a fighting spirit & doesn't settle.

9793 2018-02-22 17:49:38 I suppose it's just like how the NRA and racists love it when undocumented immigrants kill someone. Woo Hoo! Time to celebrate. Ratings gold. Sell 'em off the shelves boys!
9794 2018-02-22 17:49:38 Oh my god this clip of drunk scott moir at the gold medal game
9795 2018-02-22 17:49:34 Projection from the Republicans again. It is @NRA who finds these mass shootings as *ratings gold*.  Sales were down, but now they're up.
That's why they poke the bear and stoke the hatred.
9796 2018-02-22 17:49:32 Think about it though, the time it takes to make 12m gold in game is more than the time to make $500 at minimum wage irl.

9799 2018-02-22 17:49:28 Olympic curling has blow my mind. It's a sport that requires throwing things, yelling and sweeping. I didn't realize I could represent my country, bring honor to my family and win a gold medal for the things I already do so well.
9800 2018-02-22 17:49:28 I’d give him a gold medal for maturity & for not being afraid to ask any question he wants! That young man was exerting his constitutiomal right to ask a question of his Senator who works for him & his constituent!

It's not a great situation, but companies everywhere are having to re-assess/re-structure  final-salary pension schemes, especially the lucrative gold-plated public sector ones - its called the real world, the place those who voted will inhabit one day.

9840 2018-02-22 17:48:02 빨리 물의형태 보고와주셈요
9841 2018-02-22 17:48:01 Maddie you are awesome and a pleasure to watch play hockey.  Congratulations on the gold medal at the Winter Olympics. Keep up the good work!
9842 2018-02-22 17:47:59 Oh, come on! Rush Hour 2 was just pure gold!
9843 2018-02-22 17:47:58 Disrespectful.
The Olympic dream is earning the chance to go play for your home country and sometimes you win a medal. Sorry it's not the Gold you thought you deserve, but you still we able to live the dream and return with a medal. #PyeongChang2018 #womenshockey

9845 2018-02-22 17:47:57 I don’t want any unless it’s gold
9846 2018-02-22 17:47:50 @krissscalderon happy birthday baddie  I hope your day is marvelous, can’t wait for the tu!! Stay gold 
9847 2018-02-22 17:47:48 It may be ratings gold but she just doesn’t like the light being shined on the issue.

9851 2018-02-22 17:47:35 EH! America, you can savor your gold metal in womens hockey, just like you savor that big fat plate of biscuts n gravy. #Congrats @jimrome
9852 2018-02-22 17:47:34 포토샵 작업했는데 넘 행복하다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 재밌
9853 2018-02-22 17:47:31 It's hard to climb. I dropped 300SR in a week and hadn't won a single game despite having all Gold Medals. It's a broken system. Don't take it too hard.

9855 2018-02-22 17:47:26 Main point is that actuarial value is determined by OOP limits *and* cost-sharing (whether copays or deductibles).  If you took those gold plans, and reduced the OOP limits, you would have to also increase the deductible, otherwise the actuarial value would rise above 80%.
9856 2018-02-22 17:47:18 I would be happy with any medal in the olympics i mean I’d be bummed to not get gold but still
9857 2018-02-22 17:47:16 Hungary  was HUNGRY for the gold medal! What a race! #ShortTrack #Pyeongyang2018
9858 2018-02-22 17:47:10 @NicHens29 well done!!!! Super proud of this whole team!!! God job ladies!!! #gold #goaliemomlove #coloradoproud
9859 2018-02-22 17:47:08 Nice try but no gold ring for you, we will not be distracted from #ParklandStudentsSpeak #NeverAgain #NRAKillsKids #sandyhookpromise #Columbine and all the rest.
9860 2018-02-22 17:47:05 What’s the problem? She was pissed they didn’t get the gold. I applaud her for her intensity and not wanting a participation medal. As usual, outrage over something minuscule.
9861 2018-02-22 17:47:04 Oh wow. Hungary won its first #gold ever in the Winter #olympics.
9862 2018-02-22 17:47:03 I hope the men who are forever shouting women shouldnt depend on a man for money (ie we dont want gold diggers crew) are using that same energy to assist in the economic empowerment of women in their own lives.
9863 2018-02-22 17:47:02 #Badsportsmanship should never be rewarded.— You don't like #Silver ? We'll take it back. Get a #gold painted trophy playing in the minor leagues..
9864 2018-02-22 17:46:57 Got to put some back on Gold Star, you’ll kick your self for cashing out if it wins and even more so for not doig a single
9865 2018-02-22 17:46:55 cheers from Canada congrats on the us womens gold medal win that lady wasn't a good sport a shameful thing to do
9866 2018-02-22 17:46:52 There’s a reason why we have gold trim on our hockey jerseys, for us Canadians it’s gold or nothing. She didn’t throw into the stands, she didn’t put in the garbage, she didn’t leave the ceremonies early, she took it off her neck after a heartbreaking loss....calm down people
9867 2018-02-22 17:46:50 I had a dream I was a gold medalist figure skater last night  I’m awful at skating 
9868 2018-02-22 17:46:48 A huge congrats to the USA Women's Hockey team for winning the gold. Canada and USA are still fierce competitors, makes for great games.
9869 2018-02-22 17:46:47 De gold Label
9870 2018-02-22 17:46:46 Wow, Hungary winning short track gold?!?!
9871 2018-02-22 17:46:46 Hahahahahahahaa this is gold
9872 2018-02-22 17:46:46 Try turning croc-clips so only touching pin0 and GND pin. Not touching  other little gold pads. Test without florist wire. Touch non micro:bit end of croc-clips together to see if that registers "on P0 pressed" code. If that works then test with florist wire

9875 2018-02-22 17:46:43 I’m ok with it ... cause I’m sure she wouldn’t have worn the gold either right? 
9876 2018-02-22 17:46:41 紅「そのふざけたダサい前髪何とかならないんですか？横にいる僕が恥ずかしいんですけど」金「あん？俺のセンスに文句あんのかよ」紅「文句しかないです」金「なんだとてめえ！」紅「（口悪いしダサいしこんな野蛮な人なのに・・・馬鹿げてる）」
9877 2018-02-22 17:46:40 Question: What does abrogation of gold standard mean?
9878 2018-02-22 17:46:40 I replaced ertijal with janoobi on my lucky 15 im looking at 1450 if gold star will win €1 lucky15.
So lets do it!! Come on goldstar!!
9879 2018-02-22 17:46:36 even grandad knows that gold medal games shouldn't go to shootouts, regardless
9880 2018-02-22 17:46:35 going for gold 
9881 2018-02-22 17:46:33 Thanks a lot for the support, appreciate the kind words and we'll try to bring the gold home!
9882 2018-02-22 17:46:31 So when we arm our teachers, does past military or police experience and/or a preexisting gun permit translate to higher salaries? Can they use years in the service in contract negotiations, start bidding wars for trained, armed teachers?
9883 2018-02-22 17:46:29 Great gold medal game agree no OT 4 on 4...how bout we stay at 5 on 5 for OT until a winner is decided.
9884 2018-02-22 17:46:29 With last knight's win for both the @GoldenKnights and @usahockey Women's hockey team gold medal, it certainly was a #GoldenKnight. #VegasBorn #USA #Gold #Golden

9886 2018-02-22 17:46:25 Good luck Cowboys!  Bring home the gold!
9887 2018-02-22 17:46:24 That white and gold is unreal!
9888 2018-02-22 17:46:20 BFD.  Then he partied and then went to Mar-a Lago.  I guess he must have gone there to grieve and sit on his gold toilet and tweet.  I hope he enjoys prison.
9889 2018-02-22 17:46:19 How is losing in the gold medal game and receiving a silver medal being ungrateful?

9893 2018-02-22 17:46:10 Don't you think it would be better than gold tho? I'm sure someone has a kit like that already.
9894 2018-02-22 17:46:10 I too would rather hold gold than dollars.
9895 2018-02-22 17:46:06 this is gold. love u so much
9896 2018-02-22 17:46:02 Excellent work today, thank you. I did a trixie ertijaal, gold star and folkswood, fingers crossed for the full house

9899 2018-02-22 17:45:53 Me watchin #GoldRush 

Week 1: Who would watch a whole series of this?

Wk 2: Cool look at them weighing all that shiny gold.

Wk 5: WELD THE FUCKING BAR PARKER. We need Sluicifer running 200 yards of pay an hour on this cut if we wanna reach our target.
9900 2018-02-22 17:45:52 ثم تدرك متأخراً بعد إسرافك بمشاعرك ومحاولاتك بالتعمّق والفهم والتعب أن بعض الأشخاص والأشياء كانوا في الحقيقة أتفه من أن تأخذهم على محمل الجد.
9901 2018-02-22 17:45:50 I watched the entire women’s hockey gold medal game and it was the most entertaining shit I’ve seen in months #USA
9902 2018-02-22 17:45:49 Damnn i like that super saiyan gold head piece tho
9903 2018-02-22 17:45:49 Ontem fui comprar meu maço de camel, quando cheguei lá no pt primeiramente fora temer, segundo que só tinha aquele escroto de estourar bolinha, terceiro que fiquei de cara pq tava $8 Fucking temers, e quarto até fiquei feliz pq acabei pegando o Marlboro Gold
9904 2018-02-22 17:45:43 liam was robbed last night y'all sleep on him too much for someone who treats us like gold

Congrats Team USA! Congrats Team Canada! Great game ladies!
9906 2018-02-22 17:45:41 Called it!!! well done #TeamUSAwomensHockey on clinching gold #WinterOlympics2018
9907 2018-02-22 17:45:40 Agreed. Terrible way to decide a gold medal.
9908 2018-02-22 17:45:29 I love the new sound of Gospel music, but does it reach our elders? Do we sing this songs at funerals to comfort those who are mourning? Are these songs only for the young generation and to hit gold on sales and to get the young sophisticated bazalwane excited?
9909 2018-02-22 17:45:28 Thank you @JohnKicklighter for gold highlight in my feed earlier , I went long on quick trade for nice easy safe profit #XAUUSD #forex
9910 2018-02-22 17:45:28 This is pure gold SO good! 
9911 2018-02-22 17:45:27 Congrats Amanda you guys still got my adrenaline pumping trust me i ran around the house 10 times when we won the gold so proud of you girls GO USA

9914 2018-02-22 17:45:22 Aye....you might be on to some gold....literally lol
9915 2018-02-22 17:45:22 Risk/reward I say. If you want to take the “indie” plunge to try and strike gold, that’s your prerogative. But if you simply want to work in the industry, I agree - no one should sacrifice their well being.
9916 2018-02-22 17:45:21 Terrible things by mayday parade ni memang tangkap leleh ah old but gold gitu
9917 2018-02-22 17:45:17 Me receiving a silver medal at the #Olympics: “I wonder how much this is gonna cost to get gold plated? ”

9919 2018-02-22 17:45:13 I know it doesn't really mean that much, but happy birthday Steve Irwin. I hope you are up there celebrating the best way you can.

9923 2018-02-22 17:45:07 gold
9924 2018-02-22 17:45:06 Stayed up late to watch the 3d period, overtime and shoot-out of the US v Canada women's gold medal game   Very happy US was finally able to overcome Canada and win the gold  When we won the shoot-out it was one of the best moments of these Olympic Games
9925 2018-02-22 17:45:05 Show your Green and Gold pride - tomorrow is Spirit Day! #WeAreSilverdale
9926 2018-02-22 17:45:05 #NationalMargaritaDay my absolutely favorite drink, other than shots of Jose Cuervo Gold, and Bud Light. I could use one, of each of them.
9927 2018-02-22 17:45:02 I am proud of all of our athletes competing for Team @TeamCanada , they make me proud!  Great effort, so proud of all the time of effort each and every athlete has put in to do their very best! #GoCanadaGo #Gold #Silver #Bronze
9928 2018-02-22 17:44:59 Great game, great story. Congratulations to the US women's hockey team, they deserved the win. Would have been great for Canada to win another gold. We'll get it next time! #GoCanadaGo #shootoutsucks @jimrome
9929 2018-02-22 17:44:58 All i have to say is, the next MAN i date is gonna be lucky as hell and treated like pure gold
9930 2018-02-22 17:44:57 Good luck if you do, you might luck out you never know. I'm 100 hours in and I've got 6 gold crowns overall.
9931 2018-02-22 17:44:55 @MayorSchieve let's turn the Reno Arch Gold for a day #turnthearchgold Reno needs a parade in honor of David Wise
9932 2018-02-22 17:44:54 my fav thing is when my friends come to me to make tweets for them bc they know my brain is full of comedic gold
9933 2018-02-22 17:44:54 Yeah, all the gold plate in the world won't do it.
9934 2018-02-22 17:44:53 @TheCousinSal Getting close to that US Gold medal over/under
9935 2018-02-22 17:44:51 Congrats to the amazing Eagles on @BC_WHockey that brought home the gold! 
9936 2018-02-22 17:44:51 gold
9937 2018-02-22 17:44:50 Gold star for you, Linda! 
9938 2018-02-22 17:44:50 Yup. They earned that gold last night.

9941 2018-02-22 17:44:44 Would you buy the original gold of it for say 10k?
9942 2018-02-22 17:44:44 So Hungary won their first gold medal of the games but Russia still has no gold. You got the Evgenia Medvedeva and Alina Zagitova! Win them figure skating gold!
9943 2018-02-22 17:44:43 Shut up it took USA 20 years to finally win a gold medal in women's hockey.
9944 2018-02-22 17:44:43 gold
9945 2018-02-22 17:44:43 Glad u had a great experience.  Prior to merger was a gold elite on @VirginAmerica. Now a @MVP75K on @AlaskaAirlines.  Check in and #ticketingHorrible since merger.  Loved them, no thinking of switching to @JetBlue
9946 2018-02-22 17:44:43 I think 4-1 about Walton Street in the Meydan closer is quite fair. Arguably should have beaten Gold Star last time out and is 1lb better off.
9947 2018-02-22 17:44:42 I don’t feel bad for Canada’s women’s team, they won gold in hockey the past 4 Olympics
9948 2018-02-22 17:44:40 Old but gold
9949 2018-02-22 17:44:40 Struggling with the emotional roller coaster of 1) USA women's hockey gold and 2) utter hate for shootouts deciding important games
9950 2018-02-22 17:44:37 I was trynna pleas my support for Team USA women’s hockey last night but Twitter was not letting me tweet like some dicks; but besides that setback  good job, y’all deserve that nice gold medal
9951 2018-02-22 17:44:37 Ah okay, thanks! I just don't want people seeing that Marquette gold while I'm browsing b-ball stats at work :)
9952 2018-02-22 17:44:36 So, in team sports you don’t win the silver, you lose the gold. In that moment with your heart ripped out, a person is criticized for having an emotional response. There will be a day when she can look back with pride of accomplishment, but this wasn’t that moment.
9953 2018-02-22 17:44:35 Hooray ..... I'm 15 years old again.    I'll have to remember to invest in gold, Apple, Microsoft, Google & Bre-x (just make sure I get out of the latter before it tanks).
9954 2018-02-22 17:44:34 I don't like the idea of championship games (gold/silver/bronze) being decided with a shootout. Prelims and quarter/semis sure, but not the big games!
9955 2018-02-22 17:44:30 SO proud of our #CanadianWomensHockey Team! I’m more proud of this silver than the 4 gold before it...WHAT AN EXCITING GAME! And the team is so gracious...you ladies are amazing & represent our country SO well! #ProudOfSilver! #ShowTheWorldHowGreatCanadiansAre! 
9956 2018-02-22 17:44:30 الصمت هو محاولتنا الأخيرة

9957 2018-02-22 17:44:26 No one gives to shits about your point. Again, people of all colors die the same way in a mass shooting. Good for you, do you want a gold star for that insight? Jesus, get over yourself.
9958 2018-02-22 17:44:25 Heart of gold. True patriot.

9961 2018-02-22 17:44:18 Thank you Scott!!! Means a lot. I miss wearing that green and gold! Go Dons.
9962 2018-02-22 17:44:16 Kessel on an Oly gold medal being decided by shootout, as US women did vs. Canada. “I mean,I liked it last night...”
9963 2018-02-22 17:44:14 And little green leprechauns are dancing around throwing gold coins. Utility bills are lowering in who's delusional world? Certainly not mine.
9964 2018-02-22 17:44:08 I am still hyped over that USA Women’s hockey game for the gold last night!! USA! USA! USA! #Olympics2018 #CantStopWatchingTheHighlights
9965 2018-02-22 17:44:07 @TeamShuster hell of a comeback boys! The chemistry is back — let’s get the gold Saturday! 
9966 2018-02-22 17:44:04 Switzerland should return all the gold given to them too.
9967 2018-02-22 17:44:03 #USAWomensHockey team and I both ended last night with flakes of gold on our shirts. There's via a gold medal for #Olympics excellence .... me from nervous eating potato chips during shootout. #USAvsCAN
9968 2018-02-22 17:44:02 OMG!!! Those are GOLD books on your hands. The first editions :)
9969 2018-02-22 17:43:55 All that glitters is not Gold!!! Lolzzz
9970 2018-02-22 17:43:52 Congratulations to all of our @MAPGirls @maphockey @MEGAGoaltending coaches and former members on winning gold and bronze.

9973 2018-02-22 17:43:50 @thebradsmith i had my Hershey gold doughnut yesterday but had to drive kind of far because they we sold out closer.  My review is a delicious doughnut but who would doubt Krispy Kreme but took two goes at it for me to finish this sweet treat. Possibly too much but I got 15 reg.
9974 2018-02-22 17:43:48 I’m sitting here on my lunch break watching #TeamUSA women’s hockey, knowing they win the gold medal, like  I love the Olympics so much.
9975 2018-02-22 17:43:48 Oh no I dunno if this is gold to know or not  Xx
9976 2018-02-22 17:43:46 Brilliant to see somebody promoting Metal for a change. Keep up the great work and hopenforna gold one day soon 
9977 2018-02-22 17:43:39 The U.S. Women's Hockey team winning gold is such a feel-good moment for this nation right now. And to do it against the team that has nagged at their heels for years, that's awesome. Great job, ladies! #USA
9978 2018-02-22 17:43:37 USA women’s hockey took the gold for the first time since 1998. In a fucking shoot out.. BRUH
