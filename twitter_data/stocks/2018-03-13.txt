94 2018-03-13 22:53:41 Haven't seen anyone make the argument but this move in tech the last 12-18mths reminds me of crude in 14-15 before the bust. Fundies differ to be sure, but no one was looking for a 75% drop in crude. Why is a 25% drop unreasonable for stocks trading w triple digit multiples?

116 2018-03-13 22:39:11 IMHO it's very shaky ground, given high current cyclical valuations, to assume past returns are indicative of the next 10 years. Given that RE is leveraged and stock investment is not, this may tilt things toward stocks.

119 2018-03-13 22:37:28 Well said. The fear of inflation was exaggerated, to the point of borderline "fear-mongering" in the media. The inflation rate is still in line of that of an economy that is still in expansionary phase. @EconGlobal

126 2018-03-13 22:32:32 The fact that AR-15s and bump-stocks are in common use means they are covered by the 2nd Amendment and they are in common use because they have been interpreted to be covered by the 2nd Amendment. That's a circular argument.

133 2018-03-13 22:24:11 No argument. Who pays for it?, what qualifies as distressed? (Involuntary commital laws were gutted by the left.) You can 3D print bump stocks at home, ASSAULT RIFLES ARE ALREADY ILLEGAL!, no arguments, no arguments. There.
134 2018-03-13 22:24:03 @CNBCFastMoney try and keep it real. The market was only down .7 percent. The market breath has been actually good over the last couple of weeks. Dan, your handful of stocks was actually 220 new highs on the nasdaq today. Nasdaq had been up 7 days in a row. A breather, Normal.
135 2018-03-13 22:23:44 Creo que hoy ha tenido como 8 subidas de precio objetivo , todas por encima de 60$

137 2018-03-13 22:22:35 WTF?! you & I disagree on many things but I still enjoy your content. I find this silly & childish behavior. The drama it creates can be entertaining but these people are messing with your life. I would love to put them in stocks & we all throw tomatoes.

144 2018-03-13 22:15:22 I understand the rationale behind large cap bank stocks but in the case of EMs, I would consider the country's financial depth, as well as the stock's weight in and its correlation to most prominent Equity indexes

146 2018-03-13 22:13:34 @ChristianThayes talkin bout stocks?
147 2018-03-13 22:09:42 It's common sense; weapons of war banned for public sale, high clip mags, bump stocks, national registry, background checks, wait period of 30 days. It takes 30 days for mortgage approval. Shouldn't be more difficult to buy a home than a weapon to kill. It should be the opposite.
148 2018-03-13 22:08:21 After reviewing my tax paperwork. I realised 70 percent of my profits came from options the other 30 percent from futures and stocks. I know where I'll be focusing my brain power on.

150 2018-03-13 22:07:36 8 out of 10 times penny stocks deteriorate after the news. Why cause people like me by on the rumor & sell on the news! $FRFS is a perfect example of what I am truly waiting on. This is what I call a lotto ticket if this reverse merger happens!
151 2018-03-13 22:07:11 Large cap bank stocks.
152 2018-03-13 22:06:57 Clearly you have no idea how publicly traded companies, stocks, and 401ks work.
153 2018-03-13 22:05:57 What exactly does the NRA do that you DONT like?  NRA’s gun safety programs?  NRA’s position of banning bump stocks that Obama’s administration refused to heed?  NRA’s programs to train& arm blacks against slave owning democrats?

157 2018-03-13 22:02:37 I hope that the BF kids connect with other students around the city to talk about deeper solutions to the gun violence that plagues our city. Because AR-15s and bum stocks may be involved in these giant shootings, but we lose way more kids  to handguns.
158 2018-03-13 22:02:35 Yesterday I saw a report that ①fake news boosted small stocks’ prices and that the surge tapered only after a year…②medium-size stox: suspicions of manipulation drove prices the “wrong” way. And ③large stox? The market supposedly ignores BS re them—you know it’ll be out there

165 2018-03-13 21:58:07 Remember, people look to make money don't fall in love with stocks. You trade it for $, use that money for you and your loved 1's. Loving a stock destroys everything around you. I will keep you guys posted with what I see!

167 2018-03-13 21:57:35 Making statements without proof doesn’t help the stocks credibility. AMLH
168 2018-03-13 21:57:08 Yes he did. I believe Rick Waite was part of that deal as well.
169 2018-03-13 21:56:46 Fewer guns for everyone means fewer guns for criminals as well.  And I do love how you brush off bump stocks after they've been used to fire 1100 rounds into a pack of country music fans.  Yep, just like a fidget spinner.
170 2018-03-13 21:55:14 Better access for mental health care, more school counselors, recognition of distressed students, then referrals. No guns for violent offenders, ban bump stocks, no assault rifles under 21, better background checks, fix communication barriers
171 2018-03-13 21:54:37 The money went to feed the bubbles of all kind of assets: real estate, stocks, bonds,...Bubbles normally finish with a sudden explosion.

183 2018-03-13 21:47:35 World stocks fall: US -.6%; Europe -1%. Concern over government dysfunction & Trump's intervention into mergers depresses markets. Ignore short-term fluctuations as long as earnings perform. Bond-proxy stocks likely will remain weak & trail S&P 500.
184 2018-03-13 21:47:26 18.7% of txpyers directly own stocks = 1%. Tx brks are small for avg to low income households & will get worse in the long run.

187 2018-03-13 21:46:07 And Las Vegas was no random act of a crazy man - it was a special operation to ban bump stocks & build the case for Americans losing all rights to bear arms. Because they are not to resist when their nation is absorbed and their wealth redistributed...after they are taken care of

3. Corps gave employees 1x bonuses and small raises, paid huge dividends to shareholders and used majority of tax cut savings to buyback stocks

221 2018-03-13 21:28:52 Exactly! I always felt that the Las Vegas shooter’s motive was that he wanted to use his weapons for what they were intended for... killing the most people in the shortest amount of time! He probably got bored with just using his ARs equipped with bump-stocks at target practice!

225 2018-03-13 21:25:35 Bump stocks alone are more dangerous to the law enforcement community than sanctuary cities will ever be.
226 2018-03-13 21:24:06 1. I started out agreeing with you: 
2. Background checks need to be airtight - no exceptions
3. "Bump stocks" turn semi-autos into virtually full auto - need to be banned - no exceptions - retroactive
4. Maybe a buy-back program 
5. Arming teachers is where I lose you
(cont'd)
227 2018-03-13 21:23:35 Hey @CNBC how is it that “tech stocks got crushed today” when the index was only down -1.02% and after 7 consecutive up days? I’d hardly say -1% is getting “crushed”!
228 2018-03-13 21:23:34 You gun banners are great for gun and ammo sales. Bought gun and ammo stocks as soon as Obama was nominated.  He didn't disappoint. Made us a lot of money.
229 2018-03-13 21:22:51 Idea: name your post about risk "playing with #fire."  I'm in stocks but over the long haul, not that risky. I bike to work - that's pretty risky.
230 2018-03-13 21:21:32 Hey when they get they own stocks. I’ll make sure to buy in 
231 2018-03-13 21:20:08 He wants inflation which will exact a toll on stocks if he finally gets it.
232 2018-03-13 21:19:40 Why?  Economy booming stocks up,  taxes cut,  regulations cut,  unemployment down,  black and Hispanic unemployment at the lowest levels in history,  women are in key White House positions.  He was elected to get things done. Not to be PC

247 2018-03-13 21:10:57 $SPY It would appear that much of the buying went to stocks that no one else wanted today. ex $FIT $FL $AMD $GPS $DKS $LFIN $M $UPS $WMT  :)
248 2018-03-13 21:10:04 Yeah Marilyn, this is a wild day for news and stocks, tho DOW only down 172 for the day, still it's not up.

Sorcha's report today wraps iall up
249 2018-03-13 21:09:26 I agree with everything except outlawing bump stocks. Gun right's are already infringed on enough. The issue is not gun control it's mental health control bring back asylums!

252 2018-03-13 21:08:31 You realize that CTS's website is a copy paste from multiple other websites?  AKA they aren't a real company and you just helped them attempt to short stocks?
253 2018-03-13 21:08:09 The commodities are getting rejected, this may be already leading the market lower. Stocks may test the highs 1-2 times more this week as the breadth has been strong so far, but the seasonality is also turning down in the second half of March... $DBX $SPX
254 2018-03-13 21:07:46 Why? an ar is great for home use and bump stocks are the fidget spinners of guns, they amuse you for a second then are a total waste of time. What middle ground is there between my right to self defense and only cops can have guns when criminals won't obey?
255 2018-03-13 21:07:07 In theory, he can cover both threes and fours since he's really long and his stocks% is great. A bit limited quickness-wise and he relies a lot on his ability to recover and bother shots from behind but he has a path to success there. If you're comfortable w/that + shot, works.

278 2018-03-13 21:00:59 .@whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. Instead, insist on clean reciprocity!

290 2018-03-13 20:56:11 Does the SEC ever do anything about anything?, or are they just another worthless fed. agency. Scamming of U.S. stocks ongoing now for 10 months, about ready to get out of the market altogether, and recommending that to all others.

293 2018-03-13 20:54:19 We NEED stricter gun laws. We NEED to ban assault weapons for civilian use. We NEED to prohibit the sale of high capacity magazines. We NEED to ban bump stocks. We NEED actual change. It’s not okay that so many people are getting shot or are afraid to be shot.

297 2018-03-13 20:52:30 Why is it that biotech penny stocks are so often the very worst of the bunch? Below what you get when you scrape the bottom? And yet, so fascinating to so many people. Not many miracles in a data-driven industry.

300 2018-03-13 20:51:39 I’ve noticed that the Bears have shifted to saying “price-to-sales,” rather than “price-to-earnings” ratios prove that there is a bubble in stocks.  What they don’t account for is BOOMING productivity, and the declining price of technology, which boosts profit margins.

305 2018-03-13 20:47:04 We know they did it. They wanted us to know they did it, that’s why they unleashed a chemical nerve agent WMD on the streets of a British city that only they have stocks of or the ability to manufacture.

326 2018-03-13 20:36:03 Not true - people are well aware that corporations are buying back billions of dollars of stocks and spending a very minute amount on their employees.  The wealthiest received millions in tax cuts while middle class may see a couple of thousand.  Higher prices will eat that up

383 2018-03-13 20:04:10 During the crashing phase, most wont come out the other side, hopefully the ones you hold does and the ones you try to find a bottom do too.

384 2018-03-13 20:04:05 The real story will be what people decide to do about it. Staying with a portfolio has its costs. Also remember that there is a capital gains tax consequence for some if they choose to sell stocks. Keep that in mind with your analysis.

418 2018-03-13 19:42:23 (1) With that I think you're right. My point is only that if you broaden your view beyond tech or consumer goods and incl also assets: Stocks, bonds, etfs, housing etc. Seen this way; in my view inflation is alive, and has the potential to move from assets to consumer goods.

494 2018-03-13 19:07:28 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

513 2018-03-13 18:57:50 If buying an index, like the SPY (spider) ETF is better than trying to beat the market by investing in individual stocks, is value investing still a viable investment strategy? #askACES @HigherEdCraig #240

535 2018-03-13 18:47:01 I am done with the market. Have had bad advise from licenced investment counselors. One admitted that he did not pick stocks well. I made some very bad choices as well.

554 2018-03-13 18:32:41 But you don't have a constitutional right to an AR-15, high capacity magazines, or bump stocks. You don't have a constitutional right to avoid reasonable regulations for public health and safety. 2A doesn't trump 1A. US Supreme Court has already decided all that.

574 2018-03-13 18:22:12 The DOW opened up over 100 points. After a disappointing Treasury auction indicating inflation fears, not good for financial stocks in particular, we see a market struggling to return to new hights.  What happened to Trump's rosy scenario?

578 2018-03-13 18:20:47 Cool - it's a really useful way to think about growth stocks - they often appear overvalued when in reality they are not - they "grow into the P/E" as the legendary @RebelHQ  would say ;-)
579 2018-03-13 18:19:44 .@whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. Instead, insist on clean reciprocity!
580 2018-03-13 18:19:43 When you hear the word Investment - what does it mean to you?  “Invest in stocks? Invest in people/businesses?” Don’t assume you know what a word means to you means the same to the person sitting next to you.

583 2018-03-13 18:18:48 Like Beto, I don’t care what the NRA thinks. Their sole reason for existence at this point is to sell more guns. 
* Ban AR-15s
* Ban bump stocks
* Require universal background checks for all gun sales
* Domestic abuse convictions = removal of guns
* Allow gun violence research

635 2018-03-13 17:55:36 U.S.Stocks rallied as investors welcomed benign inflation data and digested news that President Trump nominated Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo to replace Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
636 2018-03-13 17:55:30 European Stocks fell into the red, hurt as the euro and the U.K. pound rose against the U.S. dollar on easing concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise borrowing rates by more than anticipated this year.
637 2018-03-13 17:55:22 To stocks it is similar. There are also some nsfw bloody quotes which also apply.

GIAMATTI: this fuckin’ guuuuyyyyy
MILLION DOLLAR BILL: i have a tip. I stole all the oranges in the state. We’re gonna make a billion on oranges
640 2018-03-13 17:55:04 The Dollar's decline also looks important for today.. with meaningful weakness vs Euro and Pound Sterling and Canadian Dollar.. This has helped to jumpstart some of the lagging metals in the last week, and a good bump in many of these stocks that had been hard hit in the last wk
641 2018-03-13 17:54:36 Breadth remains mixed.. While Volume a bit heavier in DOWN stocks vs UP-  Both Technology and Financials down today.. Which at 40+% of S&P, is important.. But Energy far and away the worst performing sector.. Lower by -.44% and Utilities also dropping despite Bond yields lower

645 2018-03-13 17:51:55 Ok, now do common sense gun control reform, universal background checks, ban bump stocks, high capacity magazines, mandate permits for assault weapons, mandate background checks at gun shows/pawn shops. It can be done! @PoliticalDiscor @MSNBC #NeverAgain @SenKamalaHarris

656 2018-03-13 17:46:37 Wow republican haters and gun grabbers. Clearly you hate money and want/need someone to hold your hand. I think the stocks will be fine they will go up and down like normal but will gradually increase year by year as the US dollar will be worth more
657 2018-03-13 17:46:29 I get nobody wants to give an inch when it comes to the 2nd amendment but cant we all agree that bump stocks are stupid and unnecessary. I love guns and have 0 desire to have one of these jury rigged pieces of crap
658 2018-03-13 17:46:17 All due respect - but in the media/sports context, you're all just baseball cards. Your stocks that go up and go down. Opinions and reactions are based on that fact. Its also why, when a career ends, they are always treated well. Ask Bill Buckner - Boston welcomed him back.
659 2018-03-13 17:44:52 Thanks! I'll check it out. I guess if we don't need health insurance,  it's time to short-sell those stocks. I am surprised you don't use Medicare, though.

661 2018-03-13 17:44:11 @bobcesca_go
662 2018-03-13 17:43:55 And the worst part: no matter how many signs there are, YOU STILL WANT THEM TO BUY GUNS. Bc you make lots of $$ spewing this bs Dana. Kids are dead. Raising min age to buy, banning assault weapons and bump stocks, and universal background checks are the only way to stop this.

665 2018-03-13 17:42:06 Just a story of what I did...I bought shares when (RACE-Ferrari) opened up at $44.00/Share. I got scared when CAT stocks started going down (I work at CAT) and I sold it at $72.00 a while back. Now, it’s at $124.00/share. It’s a gamble. You just never know...

670 2018-03-13 17:41:00 Fine with it all but banning the “AR-15s” you wanna ban bump stocks that’s ok. AR-15 is still semi auto just looks like a full auto.
671 2018-03-13 17:40:10 Many people comment on stocks that they do not own; intentionally say negative knowing fully well that their sole aim is to bring SP down,  they can buy @ lower price, deceiving unsophidticated investors. Once they buy now they are promoting the same stock.

679 2018-03-13 17:38:15 I like the, "...but we don't know until we try it out". How about banning assualt style guns, increasing the age limit and background checks, extended clips and bump stocks? It may save lives. We don't know until we try it out! How's that? Placing restrictions is much cheaper.

741 2018-03-13 17:02:47 Banning guns is an infringment of the 2A

2A implies "regulated" aspects and includes the words "shall not be infringed".

We may justify it, but taking guns away from the mentally ill is an infringement. Same with bump stocks & automatic weapons.

799 2018-03-13 16:38:50 Bump stocks have nothing to do with being the cause or prevention of these shootings.  You should be focusing on facts of being fore warned on so many levels & nothing was done to prevent this & other shootings.  We need to stop the shootings prior to them taking place.

801 2018-03-13 16:38:39 The thing that pisses me off the most on this topic is the stupidity of those who say there is no inflation because they use the feds basket of measurement. These are the same WS analysts and morons on finTV who say it's safe to buy stocks at these valuations/growth rates.

825 2018-03-13 16:31:03 It's relatively easy. Chop down enough trees to build a bonfire, have a wood burner make charcoal (i don't usually have luck with coal) and then smelt it with a furnace operator. It'll take about five or six dwarfs to keep the metal industry running smoothly until you have stocks

847 2018-03-13 16:21:07 Investing in stocks is easy if you are willing to take the time to just read on one profitable company who is listed on the stock exchange monthly. Choose a company that been in business for at least 10 years.

859 2018-03-13 16:16:52 Futhermore add-ons like bump stocks and silencers can also be classified as that "slippery slope" the NRA guys love to talk about so much.

861 2018-03-13 16:16:36 Previously I was referring to the 1936 gun control act. But I like how you completely ignored the modern support for the regulation on bump fire stocks, which can easily be skewed to ban all semi-automatics.

904 2018-03-13 15:53:20 @ananavarro Too many ignorant people trying to protect their pet politicians from their responsibility for butchered schoolchildren. The facts about AR15s and "bump stocks" and a "$25 addition" added to the AR15 that turns it into an automatic means nothing to them.

Institute a tiny 0.5%  financial transaction tax to cut flash trading that just skims $ from stocks w/o helping economy. Kill "carried interest", etc.

-Remove bump stocks

940 2018-03-13 15:39:44 Since you won’t even support a ban on bump stocks or Kevlar piercing bullets, we haven’t even started yet. You give a good argument though to continue the fight against NRA and rocket scientists like you and other men with small packages.
941 2018-03-13 15:39:21 1/ In 1964, there were 539 stocks in All Stocks (Stocks with cap>inf-adjusted $200 million) and in 2018 there are 2,400. The portfolios are equal-weighted. We used a dynamic rebalance where we generate a new portfolio on a monthly basis and use 12 sleeves aggregated.
942 2018-03-13 15:39:19 Yup, but BTC would be more receptive to being bid in short term so that’s why I’m thinking we’d only test lows then go higher past 12k *if* stocks decline further.
943 2018-03-13 15:39:17 Why are you afraid of the NRA? Bump stocks and ARs need to go away. Put your big boy pants on and get it done.
944 2018-03-13 15:39:11 How about instead of worrying about a wall that will do NOTHING but waste taxpayer money, you focus on proctecting America's childeren by banning bump stocks and ar-15's? THERE IS NO REASON FOR CIVILIANS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO UPGRADE THEIR WEAPONS TO MILITARY GRADE.

958 2018-03-13 15:35:26 The big difference between today and Friday is that following a strong NFP but tepid wage growth, stocks celebrated. 

Today, we have US CPI in line and stocks are not celebrating. Rather than an "anything but the dollar" trade, this could just turn into risk-off.
959 2018-03-13 15:34:57 Sitting on my hands today S&P could go either way. Preferred to have pull back in major indices. Doesn’t have to be a large pullback. Still long term bullish. #stocks

979 2018-03-13 15:28:00 I am honestly curious as to why we need to ban assault weapons when they have been illegal since 1986? An assault weapon has automatic fire capability, like a machine gun. It seems to me, in banning bump stocks, this would be fully accomplished. An AR15 in not an assault rifle.

982 2018-03-13 15:25:18 The stock market went through a correction because it had grown so much for so long. The correction happens when people and algorithms sell stocks off and move the money around before reinvesting it. This is a sign of a healthy economy. Overall, economy has soared.
983 2018-03-13 15:25:11 Good for stock-holders because outperforming others - sure. (Since e.g. people expect future dividends, so they hold on to the stocks).

Originally, our context was policies and benefit for businesses, not individual investors - who alone don't really contribute to the GDP.

1030 2018-03-13 15:06:51 What's up Twitter? This twitter page is intended to provide some real-time opinions on international equity markets. Currently, I'm looking at Boeing and Southern Company. As the FAANG stocks go - I think they need a little rest.
1031 2018-03-13 15:06:42 Wall Street Instant Update; #Stocks off session highs in the 11am hour, DJI up 70, Nasdaq -8, S&P +3; Oil turns lower by 1.5%; Gold up.2%; Bitcoin -6.6%
1032 2018-03-13 15:06:32 $NFLX @smartertrader it seems Citrons negative stories on companies typically affect stocks mentioned for 1-2 days, rarely 3 days, tops
1033 2018-03-13 15:05:20 Stocks struggle to hold gains, NASDAQ turns negative. Bonds AND cryptos now under pressure.
1034 2018-03-13 15:05:06 You just have to run it through conflicts check and then you’re fine. It was a small biotech company and we had no ties to it. It’s actually a good barrier to keep most people from individual stocks!

1036 2018-03-13 15:04:54 There’s strong statistical support for Sell in May. Global stocks returned 10% pa since 1974 in USD. 

0.3%pa of that accrued between May and October. 

I blame the seasonality of actual economic data. Black Friday, the day when US retailers go into profit, is in November.
1037 2018-03-13 15:04:40 Tillerson did many good things in a good position along with some bad decisions to downsize state dept. History will be kind to him. But even he knew this was becoming inevitable. Gotta see ExxonMobil stocks in coming days though.

1044 2018-03-13 15:02:22 Growth is not Safe :) Youre seeking high returns with growth stocks and they will come with higher risk. AMZN of course will have higher growth potential than SNE but at the same time its trading at highs so maybe wait for a pullback? Your call at the end of the day though

1051 2018-03-13 15:00:42 As much as I despise Obama and his fascist drivel, the stock plummet doesn't appear to be related to @Netflix' #HusseinAndMichaelShow.

My read is that it's primarily correcting from considerable over-value appraisals from where it piggy-backed atop other more-solid tech stocks.

1055 2018-03-13 14:59:59 Obsessive funds flow into FAANG is becoming beyond unhinged.  It is a columnar mkt right now, with FAANG and friends representing the only stocks of percieved value.  I would argue that this exceeds even the mania of the tech bubble, where risk was more in sector diverse. Scary!

1138 2018-03-13 14:25:58 Bump stocks were already on their way out. They convert a semi-automatic to an automatic.. which are illegal anyway.

1143 2018-03-13 14:24:00 But there are some things agreeable and could be pushed through. Ban on bump stocks sales. Not like it takes more than 2 minutes to make one out of stuff in your house. Limiting mags to 20. I would consider that. Semi auto ban... Heck no. Background for all private sales... Sure
1144 2018-03-13 14:23:39 I 100% agree that bump stocks should be banned. They are hard to control and unsafe, a hack, really. Seems obvious to me! So, obviously, after we unban fully automatic weapons that can be fired in a controlled manner as intended, ban bump stocks.
1145 2018-03-13 14:23:35 If YOU follow anything in politics, you'd realize they're NOT banning bump stocks or raising the age to 21 across the board.  As long as they're legal and sold somewhere, they can be purchased.

The biggest reason for personal bankruptcy is DEBT! 

Same with companies. If u want to  hold them for 10-12 years, be VERY wary of companies with huge debt on their books. 

Such stocks can cause permanent loss of capital in ur portfolio!

1280 2018-03-13 13:27:45 False again. Chrysler wanted to file bankruptcy as they did in the 70's so their stock holders wouldn't lose money they invested. But For the first time ever a sitting president announce the bankruptcy ahead of Chrysler. Sending stocks spiraling. Then Fiat came in and bought 58%.

1297 2018-03-13 13:21:38 This conversation isn’t about children.
You’re talking about faux “weapons of war”. AR-15 aren’t used in the military.
And bump stocks??? Which, have absolutely nothing to do with children.
Rate of fire has nothing to do with children.
Focus on root causes instead.

1298 2018-03-13 13:20:41 $HLF bullish premarket on recent executive stock sales. This is how pyramid scheme stocks trade... it doesn't have to make sense
1299 2018-03-13 13:20:23 Banning bump stocks isn’t going to do anything to curb gun violence when you can achieve the same effect with a belt loop on your pants. Seriously ... let’s focus on things that can ACTUALLY curb firearms abuse.
1300 2018-03-13 13:20:00 The Dow Jones that fell the most yesterday with -0.62% had its industrial stocks at the top of the losses.
1301 2018-03-13 13:19:24 don't worry, crypto traders are not into making money as much as they are in changing the world with altcoins and digital currencies. Us crypto/blockchain & stocks traders that use a.i. software are safe. 
1302 2018-03-13 13:18:41 There is still no real organization in the strength of stocks that  can help predict gappers, with any real consistency.
1303 2018-03-13 13:16:58 I am really getting sick of seeing dogs left in cars. Windows open half inch or not. If not taking with you then leave at home. The law is far to soft. This was murder. Oh how the stocks would help so much these days
1304 2018-03-13 13:16:54 Looks and sounds like a good one. Certainly not extended like so many stocks. Trading near same levels as six & seven years ago.
1305 2018-03-13 13:15:41 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your ADHD

1309 2018-03-13 13:13:03 Very lately i have given up this habit of loving the stocks in my portfolio. Have churned my portfolio this year, booking some losses and profits. We must catch the themes and sectors that would outperform others and not stick to what we believe in.

1315 2018-03-13 13:11:27 Seems to have dragged other tech stocks with it. The timing of the sale may have worried the market - especially with Trump threatening to impose greater tariffs on Indian exports unless we cut duties on imports of American goods.

1318 2018-03-13 13:09:34 No Darlin’ WE ARE TALKING ABOUT DEAD KIDS! You may want to dodge that elephant in the room but it is a fact the CHILDREN are dying because of weapons of war ie AR 15 and bump stocks. The FACT is an AR 15 kills more in a shorter amount of time... Great for military.

1322 2018-03-13 13:08:19 The NEEDS of the many outweigh the NEEDS of the few.  I don’t know a single person who NEEDS an AR-15 or bump stocks.  So yeah.  Good point.

1327 2018-03-13 13:06:18 I agree that perhaps the law was ambiguous enough to support a reading that bans bump stocks. The problem here is the politically-mandated reversal, which under,ines the argument for deference.
1328 2018-03-13 13:06:02 Stocks trade higher trimming gains amid political uncertainty.
1329 2018-03-13 13:05:12 Decent lift on most of our stocks. Why we don't sell all of them. $MU gapping up over 2 points. $AMZN  gapping up over 12 points. We let trends "work" for us.

1331 2018-03-13 13:04:13 Without dividend imputations, Australian shareholders (and funds) would be better off in many cases investing in foreign stocks instead of domestic Australian stocks. So all that investment capital shifts off shore.
1332 2018-03-13 13:03:48 Oscar, you have completely missed my point, it's not about the two stocks.   Have a great day regardless.  Don't call people names, it's a bad look.  #Respect

1335 2018-03-13 13:02:46 highly trained expert teachers ?  my teachers couldn’t even spell correctly through my entire school career .. I’m sure someone paid you to say “bump stocks will soon be out” so your followers will all run out and buy them “before they go away” (& they won’t really go away)

1337 2018-03-13 13:02:20 in an ideal world there will always be “sugardaddies” because investors will always seek out ways to become a part of something good with the desire to make it better. 

Just like with buying stocks.
1338 2018-03-13 13:01:52 Really can’t play stocks right now. Currency game is 24/7.
1339 2018-03-13 13:01:44 Yes. Crypto investment is all hype. But, so are tech stocks which trade at 20 times earnings. We are playing a game to see who can sell their sardines before the cards collapse, but, let's not conclude that crypto is uniquely dangerous.
1340 2018-03-13 13:01:44 Exxon stocks rose on Tillerson’s sacking—coinkidink?
1341 2018-03-13 13:01:44 Las vegas for example? And in Florida recently. They speed and types of bullets used in these guns are far more deadly that what is used in hand guns. The access to bump stocks, cartridges with over 100 bullet capacity,  and so on.  It's just too much.

1344 2018-03-13 13:01:13 actually the altcoin crowd is missing out on so many great profitable crypto stocks related trades by limiting themselves just to trading altcoins. Many smart altcoin investors are now learning to trade crypto/blockchain related stocks (which have been very profitable of late)
1345 2018-03-13 13:01:11 I keep thinking when the “sacred”second amendment was enacted, folks just wanted to keep their muskets! No one envisioned AR-15’s or bump stocks, or folks keeping private Arsenal’s.

1359 2018-03-13 12:55:58 CPI index (inflation measure) came out as expected.  10 year Tbond down, and stock futures up as a result.  Unless bad news, stocks should re-test all time highs.  Next week Fed Reserve meets to set interest rate hikes.  How much the actual hike & number of times will be key.
1360 2018-03-13 12:55:42 In a bull market, stocks rally on bad news. In a bear market stocks sell-off on good news. This is an easy way to recognize market sentiment. #Trading #Tip

1405 2018-03-13 12:28:49 Japanese stocks closed higher, led by gains in exporters, after USD/JPY (^USDJPY) climbed to a 1-week high, which boosted the earnings prospects of exporters with the weaker yen.
1406 2018-03-13 12:28:23 Trading activity was muted ahead of the release of U.S. Feb CPI later this morning, which may affect the outlook for Fed policy tightening

1419 2018-03-13 12:23:13 The wonderful part about rights, is you don’t have to do a whole lot to justify them. I personally think ‘bump’ stocks are stupid (though I do understand how they function). I also am not a huge fan of high caliber pistols, but that has more to do with my ability to control them.
1420 2018-03-13 12:23:05 Thus stocks are going downstairs ?
1421 2018-03-13 12:22:39 Just to be clear if 20 died in a shooting, then rifles, magazines, bump stocks were banned, then 19 people died in a shooting. The new laws would be worth it. Tbh they’d be worth it if more then 20 died in the latter shooting.
1422 2018-03-13 12:22:13 In not a Obama fan but NFLX is one of the FANG stocks that's even more overvalued based on historical norms than the general stock market. The Fed has supported stock prices by printing money. NFLX will fall on its own, Obama not withstanding.

Yes, bump stocks infact do increase the rate of fire, yes we all understand it's still limited to trigger pulls, and yes we're just going to run roughshod over the people who can't get beyond "akshully teknikally it's not".

Note a Cormorant will eat up to twice its body weight in fish every day. Norfolk Broads are black with the bloody things.

1573 2018-03-13 10:37:36 I know the late Jim Slater had a lot of success using the PEG Ratio. I can't say I'm a fan tbh. Some of the best growth stocks will have a PEG > 1.0. Also, PEG < 1.0 can sometimes be a cheap trap as it can occur after a former leader has put in a major top and is breaking down.

1878 2018-03-13 05:37:03 It starts with bump stocks then it’s AR15s when the left doesn’t see the outcome they thought they would get next would be hand guns... get it? It’s how it will go because the left isn’t having the correct conversation. It’s not the gun that’s the issue.

1901 2018-03-13 05:14:31 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

1932 2018-03-13 04:49:11 Actually, Scott is exactly right. 2A says nothing about unlimited rights to own whatever you please. Tanks. RPG, automatic weapons, etc. A limit is obvious, the question is where the line is drawn. Assault weapons and bump stocks are not needed for self defense or hunting.

1937 2018-03-13 04:46:46 Yeah, he is kinda all over. I think he is probably torn on what to do, since there are so many things to do and everyone is tugging him this way and that way. / I was reading the legis file from early 1930s, and it kinda seems as though bump stocks should be already illegal...

Trump has an exec power he might be using to ban away the bump stocks. Stop School Violence Act should fix up BG system, hopefully!

1950 2018-03-13 04:34:23 The GOA is the top tier organization. And the NRA supported gun registration in the 1920's, the 1934 gun control act, the Brady bill, the 1986 assault weapons ban, as well as begged the ATF to unconstitutionally write laws in regards to bump fire stocks and a few others. .

It takes the focus off things that are actually important. Like *actually universal* background checks. And banning bump stocks. Limiting high capacity

1955 2018-03-13 04:26:11 3/ If the sale is legal, what can be done? Do Republicans want the U.S. govt interfering with who buys & sells stocks? Again, that uranium mine was owned by a Canadian company. Numerous govt agencies had to review that sale, & I guess the uranium itself can't leave the U.S.
1956 2018-03-13 04:23:41 I can tell you're one of those people who never thinks the market is too high, but God forbid it pulls back a few % points then you come out saying, "there's no reason for stocks to go down".  So when market goes up 25% has incomes and purchases gone up 30% in that time period?

1961 2018-03-13 04:22:44 Automatic is a technical and legal definition that bump stocks don't make a gun meet.  How about we just leave it at that?  Yes they can make a gun fire faster but often at a huge loss of accuracy.  But no matter what it's still not an automatic.
1962 2018-03-13 04:22:03 2/ So the Canadian company wanted to sell most of its shares to a Russian buyer--which I agree is concerning--but, in the U.S. we allow foreign investors to buy stocks.

1982 2018-03-13 04:05:16 State law won't solve this. If CA bans bump stocks and raises the age limit it will just create a criminal enterprises for people to smuggle from nearby states. Federal Laws are the only solution. #GunReformNow
1983 2018-03-13 04:05:14 Agreed. But you don't need to buy certain guns at 18; we don't need to be selling certain guns at all; no one needs high-cap mags or bump stocks; people can wait 3 days before receiving a gun; & majority of Americans support universal background checks.
1984 2018-03-13 04:04:56 ISIS destroyed, economy flourishing, Black & Hispanic unemployment historic low levels, women unemployment 17 yr low, labor participation highest ever, wages up, home ownership up, housing prices way up, stocks 40% up.

1985 2018-03-13 04:03:22 I am a Conservative and I believe, to be serious about this, we need to ban bump stocks and lower the magazine amount.  No more than 10 bullets.  I know others will not agree with this, but we need to protect people.

2008 2018-03-13 03:48:57 @netflix I got an idea that might increase your stocks. I know movies and shows leave Netflix from month to month. How about letting people have a buy show and/or movie setup added to Netflix. Digital buying is the future. You could have stream and buy. Please think about it

Bump stocks are nothing but a novelty item, and they don’t allow you to do anything that you can’t do with your thumb and belt loop.

Educate yourself.

2022 2018-03-13 03:40:55 Yes, it's confusing. Ban Semi Automatics such as AR-15s which are weapons designed to kill massive amount of people. Period. Plus ban all accessories like bump stocks (like the Vegas shooter used) that make a gun into an illegal automatic weapon.

2047 2018-03-13 03:21:27 Justice Department moves to officially ban bump stocks, classifies them as ‘machine guns’ - They used to be illegal until Obama signed them into Law - another bad decision
2048 2018-03-13 03:20:53 Mr. President, increasing  the age limit & banning bump stocks isn’t going to fix this problem #2ndAmendmentRights ... I do agree w/ arming qualified teachers or having armed security of some type #MAGA

2052 2018-03-13 03:17:40 I don't agree with the bump stock ban and age limit. The A T F has already said that the bump stocks are legal. It's a piece of plastic. An 18 yo can enter the military or vote but can't buy a gun when they have been pre checked and OKAYED by their state to do so?

2070 2018-03-13 03:06:53 Background checks great & also bump stocks banned is great. Now what happens if a teacher in a moment of panic & by accident shoots a student in crossfire who pays the price then. It happens with cops & military what makes you think it won't happen to teachers.
2071 2018-03-13 03:06:10 They still need a viable alternative and last time I checked NAB pays 6.5%. Good luck in finding a higher yield at a lower risk profile while also having day-to-day trading liquidity #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #banks

2073 2018-03-13 03:04:44 love how @SEC had no idea to predict 2009 crash and now warns me about risky places to invest... c.f. the bad Monday take on CNBC where the fund advisor who failed to see a 15-20 percent flash drop predicts how long stocks will be negative.
2074 2018-03-13 03:04:40 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.(No.131) #Duo30L11
2075 2018-03-13 03:04:15 I don’t get what you’re saying. My point is if people died faster we could run more stocks. And if we run more stocks that increases consistency.
2076 2018-03-13 03:02:55 Opposing age limit now, sad. Background checks, fine but at what point does someone cross the line, go crazy, shooting may be first sign. Ban bump stocks Yes but banning assault weapons as well is what the American people want, even repubs and logical gun owners.

2099 2018-03-13 02:54:09 Don't raise the age for guns or ban bump stocks.  This won't fix anything.  No more stupid laws.  Give those teachers guns and train them.

2126 2018-03-13 02:35:35 The thing is he doesn’t have all that. It’s his net worth so what he has in stocks and in his company and in shares and in his property. But yea he’s still donating though.
2127 2018-03-13 02:32:56 If the EU outs huge tariffs on our fish stocks that will be like putting a noose around their own necks. There has always been a big demand from Europe for our fish. Therefore we will have no problem selling it to them. If they inflated the price the buyers would kick up.

2131 2018-03-13 02:31:22 Because if that guy that Jake Paul found in the forest would've had a gun, it would've been a totally different story. 

Great collaboration. This will lift both their stocks back up.

2133 2018-03-13 02:29:28 Today would be a good day for @TIAA, who manages retirement funds for millions of educators, to divest themselves of all gun stocks. #teachers #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives @JoyAnnReid
2134 2018-03-13 02:29:28 Banning bump stocks will do exactly nothing!!!!
2135 2018-03-13 02:28:58 Only Robert Mueller is prosecuting and we’ve seen him do that. Funny that you know how to type in all caps. However, when it’s time for you to raise age limit to buy guns, ban bump stocks, bring solutions to school shootings. We can’t find you but you ”hear us?”
2136 2018-03-13 02:28:40 Yes ok ! This upcoming "dinner-diplomacy" shall definitely be a cause of self-satisfaction for @SoniaGandhi_FC in her amidst possibly admitting the compulsion of her son's laughable falling stocks.

2144 2018-03-13 02:22:40 Raising the minimum age for gun sales is not a bad deal (personally, I'd raise it to the age when the decision making and impulse control centers of the brain have finished developing). Mandatory rights, responsibilities, and liability test. Banning bump stocks and cranks.
2145 2018-03-13 02:22:32 Clearly irrational to arm teachers and turn schools into prisons as primary mode to make our children safer. Far better 2 use rational gun control: waiting period 4 all purchases, no automatic weapons or bump stocks, confiscate weapons from high-risk individuals (at a minimum)!
2146 2018-03-13 02:22:17 Unbearable! Seriously frightening. Would this guy look at his customers on FB for instance to see if they support Trump and tamper with their investments!? Sell them losing stocks and get them out of good positions just to HARM THEM!? THIS IS SERIOUSLY OUTRAGEOUS!
2147 2018-03-13 02:21:48 3 pharma stocks are giving bullish signals - Lupin, Wock and Ajanta. Whereas Metals still don't seem to have any intrinsic strength. Will look to short them higher. AL puts can be added - 139 coming.
2148 2018-03-13 02:21:35 Hey I still need to play that. But I believe if the game was faster paced we could run more stocks and that would increase consistency.
2149 2018-03-13 02:20:16 The past sucked wildly but I think they were on to something when they would throw people in stocks and peg them with rotten vegetables for their social follies
2150 2018-03-13 02:20:04 @_LINEFRIENDS hello, may i know if there will be available bt21 stocks in Itaewon next week? If there are none, which branches have the stocks(especially cushions)? Hopefully Incheon has it. Thank you

2152 2018-03-13 02:19:10 Remaniacs are claiming that Brexit will destroy our fishing industry totally because our fish stocks will be destroyed without EU quotas, the EU will put huge tariff on our catches if exported to Europe and that no one in Britain eats the fish from our waters as wrong types
2153 2018-03-13 02:18:46 Retirees and SMSFs selling #Banks shares because ALP intends to scrap cash payments from ATO? Banks reconsidering their div policy? What a load of rubbish! Vested interests are talking without a brain #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities

2155 2018-03-13 02:16:07 Peter, good on you for pointing this out - and Lionel, I'm glad you signalled it's a problem. People make these comparisons all the time. My reaction: if people think stocks and flows make for a sensible comparison, what other basic concepts are they messing up? #thinking
2156 2018-03-13 02:15:48 Bonds go down, rates up, stocks go down.  Dollar down too, as bonds weaken, foreign flows reverse?  Gosh, what is there that just might start to move higher?  Got gold?

2167 2018-03-13 02:09:03 So banning of bump stocks, semi-auto rifles, and raising the age of long guns to 21 should do it then #DianneFeinstein?
2168 2018-03-13 02:03:01 Bump stocks or slide fire stocks were designed for shooters with disabilities that prevent them from pulling a trigger.

Why do you hate disabled people?
2169 2018-03-13 02:02:24 Go ahead, tell me why YOU need bump stocks.  Go ahead, tell me how this is “too far,” and how we’re going to “destroy the Second Amendment.”
2170 2018-03-13 02:02:11 I hope my lib friends are happy about this movement to ban bump stocks. Makes me nervous...
2171 2018-03-13 02:01:46 And yet we've seen multiple incidents in which those and similar weapons were used to mow down people with bump stocks. Focus less on wording you don't like and more on the fact that this particular type of weapon isn't a necessity for civilians.

    New in ban: Andhra Bank, BEML
2176 2018-03-13 01:59:25 Before choosing the exact strike and expiration I look at how the option seems to be trading. Is the spread large and not moving much with the action? Go closer to the money or to the expiration. Be careful some stocks have less liquid options so it's all relative. /3
2177 2018-03-13 01:58:25 Exactly. Why? They are illegal. Caught selling one, prison time. VERY tough to get a hold of. SO...do the same with large capacity magazines, bump stocks, assault style rifles...
2178 2018-03-13 01:58:23 $GTG not to mention the existing Cancer Diagnostics business with ASX Cancer Stocks running hard should get a bud here too
2179 2018-03-13 01:58:21 No stocks, no investments makes that extra $12,000 standardized deduction even more valuable.  You are describing a situation for a significant tax break.
2180 2018-03-13 01:58:10 @TMFUltraLong Are you smoking pot? First you write that the Canadian pot stocks are going to be diluted and earnings are down. Don’t buy. Within that story there’s a link to a story you also wrote saying to buy the same stocks you don’t recommend .

2183 2018-03-13 01:56:09 Stocks didn’t even need to go up today for the speculators to pile up on call contracts. There was some hedging also in $VIX, but relatively low volume. S&P 500 Index needs to break out over 2,850, looks difficult immediately, but the trend is still up, let’s see... $SPX
2184 2018-03-13 01:53:55 Yep. Bump stocks are the only thing you’ve left in your plan.
2185 2018-03-13 01:53:50 I'm not trying to throw stones, but since the adj is really just the error calculated from prod+imp-ref-exp not matching the reported data values for stocks, what's the point estimating adj?  You're actually trying to estimate their error.  You essentially estimate build +5.4mb.
2186 2018-03-13 01:52:14 That's exactly what I am saying, if you want a house put down as little as possible,  borrow as long as possible, never make an extra payment and put all of you cash into stocks that will eventually be worth multiples of your home. I guess we misunderstand each other somehow.
2187 2018-03-13 01:52:03 Probably while stocks last. But actually this has kinda inspired me to contemplate making a similar dessert but with molten lava cake as a starting point.

2190 2018-03-13 01:50:48 Well, yeah.  Bump stocks are completely unnecessary and had zero reason to be in the hands of ths public.  Heaven forbid they actually make sensible adjustments.
2191 2018-03-13 01:50:07 @HalftimeReport , stocks move on fear and greed, not fundamentals or valuation. Those things cause fear and greed. $NFLX and $MU are short to mid term shorts. Too far too fast. Left is right.
2192 2018-03-13 01:49:30 The REPs led by Nunez should have a modern day tar and feathering by being covered in honey and feathers and put in stocks in the Mall for tax payers to see who wasted millions. Too much?  @SRuhle @BrookeBCNN @JoyAnnReid @EricHolder @Lawrence
2193 2018-03-13 01:48:48 Bump stocks are worthless and military rifles have been banned since 1932. Try some more bs. ARs are used in less than 100 of the 13,000+ shootings annually. Guns aren’t bad.
2194 2018-03-13 01:48:10 You want to know why the stocks that are going up...you know, the ones that you so brazenly BRAG about...are going up? Because of OUR President. I say that, lest you say he is not your president, but he is! Must you be so ostentatious about your vast wealth… LOL
2195 2018-03-13 01:47:45 Dont forget they are doubling capital gain tax also so no point going from income to growth stocks
2196 2018-03-13 01:47:43 But those 30 stocks are the best reflection of our market, Mike, especially in this era digital evolution and revolution 
2197 2018-03-13 01:47:30 That's next on the banned list. We've already banned bump stocks here in Massachusetts, and we don't allow open carry either. No mass shootings.

2200 2018-03-13 01:46:05 Not very hard if one is a skilled trader. FYI, I am already in $RARS
2201 2018-03-13 01:45:29 Bump stocks; one more time! A federal ban on anything is interpreted by individual states differently. By laws are made and Murphy’s Law Applies! “What can go wrong,will go wrong”. So I have been running this in my mind! Why is it so important? Trump is not stupid...
2202 2018-03-13 01:45:27 It took us all of two weeks to ban bump stocks after Vegas massacre.
2203 2018-03-13 01:45:07 "BUM" stocks fire every 20 to 40 minutes, unless the shooter is under 21 and has not learned proper gun control.  

Remember when Socrates stated that before any conversation, all terms that would be used must be defined? The gun control zealots refuse to learn how a gun works.
2204 2018-03-13 01:43:55 Yup. But in a low floater like rars it is hard to say where the bottom at and where the sky will be
2205 2018-03-13 01:43:39 What what? The @NRA caves to the gungrabbers constantly.
Latest cave, bump stocks.
2206 2018-03-13 01:43:08 Really makes you think how bumpfire stocks are possibly going to be banned after an incident that didn't involve them but they weren't banned immediately after an incident that supposedly did involve them. 
2207 2018-03-13 01:41:56 Banning bump stocks will do nothing. Putting more guns in schools greatly increase the chance of students getting shot. You are unqualified as president at every level.
2208 2018-03-13 01:41:13 The libs are at it again. They are getting bolder. Better build your guns and bump stocks. #2AShallNotBeInfringed
2209 2018-03-13 01:41:11 Gotta buy stocks in Kleenex Tissues, Hot chocolate and teddy bears
2210 2018-03-13 01:40:42 See, there you go twisting the narrative. Strict gun laws ="banning" to you people.   94% of Americans wanted stricter laws after Sandy Hook.  80% want them now.  Even SANE NRA members.  Why do you need an assault rifle? Bump stocks?  You hunting Godzilla?
2211 2018-03-13 01:40:25 Trump : I’m going to have to do this alone because Congress is afraid of the @NRA. Background checks, raise the age, no bump stocks!

NRA : We gave you $30 million last time, I guess we can give you $60 million next time.

Trump : We need to arm teachers! More guns! Boom boom!
2212 2018-03-13 01:40:18 I agree to arming teachers but bump stocks don’t kill people. People kill people.
2213 2018-03-13 01:39:34 we've already accomplished stuff tho lol. the legal age to purchase a rifle has been raised, the waiting period for all gun purchases has been extended, bump stocks are banned ??? civic engagement is an integral part of the fight for change, eric.

2215 2018-03-13 01:38:04 When is someone going to ask the GOP how would they stop the Vegas shooter. No mental illness, all AR15s purchased legally, high capacity magazines and bump stocks legal, passed all background checks, no social media rants- 1,100 rounds, 58 dead, 604 shot.
2216 2018-03-13 01:36:43 —your name on it, so you go for the generic ones that the ER stocks? /My/ ER? That's just perfect!" At this point, the anger courses through my blood so quick, I can't tell if there's more of it or disappointment within me. "You keep saying /I/—

2221 2018-03-13 01:33:59 Nice to see logical ideas being presented. Bump stocks were only designed to get around the automatic firearms laws. No need for an average American to have one. It is more accurate to fire single rounds.

2229 2018-03-13 01:26:53 You believed #FakeNews on bump stocks and bg checks. Ask Bush Senior what happened in '94 after betrayed his core. You traitor! You're going down in '20.
2230 2018-03-13 01:26:08 thank you. I missed the bottom on that one. My strategy is to pick stocks at the bottom. $RARS will be a good one imo.
2231 2018-03-13 01:25:55 A semi-automatic firearms ban is not pending. The parkland shooter used 10 round magazines. No one is arguing bump stocks, but it ends there.

2237 2018-03-13 01:23:02 To be honest, a belt loop can be used to the same effect. One doesn’t need to spend the money on an accessory. Also, if he had not used a bump stock and had been proficient, there could have been more fatalities. Bump stocks make the rifle inaccurate.
2238 2018-03-13 01:22:04 Because the future youth of this nation will fix what the fat bellied politicians who cant see their balls let alone use them, fix it.  No need for assault riffles,  no need for bump stocks, back ground checks, and a waiting period.  A list of all guns and amo a person owns. DONE
2239 2018-03-13 01:21:15 Yes I do
2240 2018-03-13 01:21:08 Sorry.. no ya
2241 2018-03-13 01:19:37 everyone who knows me should observe my daily routines and buy stocks accordingly. apparently i'm too dumb to see it but I have a knack for being on board early with hyper-growth companies. somebody should make money off of it at least!
2242 2018-03-13 01:19:21 "Bump stocks" is not a serious conversation.
"Arm the teachers" is not a serious conversation.

"Change the gun laws to reduce the number of killings" is the start of a conversation.

All theoretically "increase rate of fire" but are ESSENTIAL to defense.

@ProteusNZ sent me this copy but I checked Book Depository and it is listed there and ships to Oz. Surely someone local stocks it... ()

2253 2018-03-13 01:11:07 Agreed @realDonaldTrump except for bump stocks they’re not the problem it’s the people getting them not the guns themselves
2254 2018-03-13 01:10:35 So did all stocks today
2255 2018-03-13 01:10:30 Remember when they were going to put nasty pictures of the lungs of life long smokers on cig packs? They should consider putting the crime scene photos of mass shootings on the stocks, barrells, magazines, and ammo boxes.
2256 2018-03-13 01:09:32 $88.7 trillion... 4th quarter: $98.7 trillion... 3rd quarter: $96.7 trillion stocks climbed for 4th quarter... S&P500 add 10%,equities $1.3 trillion... value of es: half a trillion during quarter... debt, h.hold borr. Rose at
2257 2018-03-13 01:09:08 Except that the Argentinian crop failed, the only major supplier left if Brazil which already operates with end stocks close to zero. Any shift away from USA beans requires displacing some buyer of Brazilian soybeans
2258 2018-03-13 01:08:03 To big a deal about bump stocks
Back off.
2259 2018-03-13 01:07:38 .Nicolas Cruz used 10-ROUND MAGAZINES. 

Semi-automatics- BAN WON'T HAPPEN
Bump stocks- BAN IS PENDING (GO AHEAD AND BAN THEM)
HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES- BAN WON'T HAPPEN (NO JUSTIFICATION, SEE ABOVE)
2260 2018-03-13 01:07:35 When the owner of a paid group can give you good, sound investment advice OUTSIDE of crypto, especially in stocks, then pay that person. Otherwise, there's a really good chance they're full of shit. Not all of them, but most.
2261 2018-03-13 01:07:13 No they didn't. Ask Hillary where the stocks of Libyan sarin gas went.
2262 2018-03-13 01:07:11 I don’t even understand the desire to ban bump stocks. They were used in one attack and likely made it LESS devastating. So the left including @realDonaldTrump want to ‘remove’ it? For what? To make the next MORE devastating?
2263 2018-03-13 01:07:11 I agree that bump stocks should not be for sale to the public.
2264 2018-03-13 01:06:16 Very fortunately, my highest-return stocks since opening an IB account 1.5 years ago have been 3 fast growing co of at least historical 50% YOY growth with low forward valuations of around 15x. Growth became catalyst that lifted low valuation a year later today.
2265 2018-03-13 01:06:04 Secret Service needs to pay him a special visit with these threats.  Guess his investment company is going broke with the stocks rising over 8 thousand point in 1 year.  Idiot!!!
2266 2018-03-13 01:05:39 Your mom is flicking through 20s on his snap story instead of investing the capital in a well diversified portfolio consisting of stocks and bonds
2267 2018-03-13 01:04:21 Wonder what will happen to the Australian stock market as the ‘wealthy’ rotate out of Aussie stocks and invest overseas?
2268 2018-03-13 01:03:27 Stocks Under $10 is looking at a noon launch time for the next addition to the list.
2269 2018-03-13 01:03:19 Bump stocks today. Guns eventually. #GunControlNever
2270 2018-03-13 01:03:14 History should show them out of office and indicted for obstruction. @DevinNunes should be placed in stocks in the town square. They want to turn this country back 200 years they get the same punishment
2271 2018-03-13 01:02:50 Don't ban bump stocks, we need them. We need everything we can get. Plz, don't buck on anything, the left will never like you
2272 2018-03-13 01:02:46 Option account grew another $20k afterwards but I kept them in option accounts. I am still trying to find the best way to manage between options and stocks accounts as they both grow.
2273 2018-03-13 01:02:11 Leave bump stocks alone. They are for disabled people. Why do you think disabled poeple don't deserve the right to fire a rifle? #2AShallNotBeInfringed
2274 2018-03-13 01:00:18 Yep, after getting approval in Sept_2016 and promptly falling from $60 to $30. Murphy’s Law re: stocks and investing: “It is morally unethical to allow suckers to keep their money!” So, I loaded up. —thlizrd
2275 2018-03-13 01:00:06 The school system is outdated is all I'm saying. When I have kids they will be learning about forex, crypto, stocks, taxs, starting & running business, buying real estate, and selling real estate etc you know real life stuff.
2276 2018-03-13 00:59:57 for fun I study stocks and manage my retirement investments... help me.
2277 2018-03-13 00:59:09 real talk miphas grace should be part of his respawn animation. if smash 5 is played with 2 stocks itd be especially fitting..
2278 2018-03-13 00:58:18 Why are bump stocks out
Our rights shall not be infringed.
Bump stock was not used was full auto ask cia why they did it
2279 2018-03-13 00:57:20 havent listened yet but Pitchard from Dirty Sanchez has a pod called My Life In The Stocks. could be funny
2280 2018-03-13 00:56:56 How so? He's unilaterally banning bump stocks and asking Congress to draft legislation...

This isn't president pen and phone.
2281 2018-03-13 00:55:50 sigeg stoooooocks ooyyy!!! nabungol nko anang stocks nimo dzai
2282 2018-03-13 00:55:25 Stocks on the rise #MoeStradamus
2283 2018-03-13 00:54:49 And i’m very open on helping people trade stocks and getting them started so I’m an asset to have in life.
2284 2018-03-13 00:54:34 We know it was because of bump stocks which you support.
2285 2018-03-13 00:53:29 @realDonaldTrump I thanked you for banning bump stocks but TODAY I here you caved to @NRA   So disappointing!!  So, thanked you prematurely. Won’t make that same mistake twice!!
2286 2018-03-13 00:53:07 In the old days they put guys like these traitors in stocks on public display.
2287 2018-03-13 00:53:02 "Well regulated" implies relevant training and struture, not a free-for-all frenzy.  None of your points nullify my primary argument, which is that interpreting the 2nd to include bump-stocks, and high-capacity semi-automatic rifles is a stretch. Why not chemical or bio weapons?
2288 2018-03-13 00:50:40 We should be teaching kids how to invest in stocks, crypto and forex.
2289 2018-03-13 00:48:36 Thanks brother!
2290 2018-03-13 00:46:32 No we shouldn’t arm teachers. Some of these teachers are absolute lunatics. Trained armed security, metal detectors, Wands & bag searches @ every school. Better universal mandatory background checks, ban bump stocks & rapid-fire mods & move forward. It’s a start. Waiting period?
2291 2018-03-13 00:45:59 Legislative change needs the president. When the president wants to pass a bill, outlawing bump stocks, strengthening background checks, and raising buying age to 21, but David Hogg refuses to answer his call?? That doesn’t seem like a desire for change.
2292 2018-03-13 00:45:26 Out of fiat for crypto doesn’t mean out of fiat. Be smart peps. Diversify in savings, stocks, crypto and a 401k. Be ready on all fronts... and buy a lotto ticket every once and a while! And most importantly don’t forget money isn’t everything! Friends are.
2293 2018-03-13 00:45:21 @whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. Instead, insist on clean reciprocity!
2294 2018-03-13 00:44:21 $RB.h PI Financial bought 1M shares at 0.035$ today and sold none. That's quite a big amount for a speculative play. I follow the money and Hugh Notman's history tells the story. He is a seasoned investment banker who closed over 50 successful deals. #stocks #investing
2295 2018-03-13 00:42:49 ss11-131
There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。
2296 2018-03-13 00:42:41 Picking stocks?
2297 2018-03-13 00:42:39 Congrats man!! That's awesome news!
2298 2018-03-13 00:41:47 Assault type rifles should be banned in addition to bump stocks. No one needs these for self protection or hunting.
2299 2018-03-13 00:40:17 Really your paranoid life leads you to believe what people in this country want to remove the second amendment.  The second amendment doesn’t say a word about bump stocks or age limits either - try and read it.
2300 2018-03-13 00:39:34 I know Obama didn’t pass huge amounts of gun regulations. I wish he had. If Trump uses the executive orders to ban bump stocks, great. I wish Obama had used EOs to restrict guns.
2301 2018-03-13 00:39:05 Ban Plan Parent Hood they kill more humans than bump stocks
2302 2018-03-13 00:39:04 so you transfer profit back and buy stocks. Good move. But do not buy options again. Is that right?
2303 2018-03-13 00:37:53 Notice how WATT isn’t breaking down - it’s amazing how some of these crap stocks are still holding about. It could be months before we see any breakdown look how long it took for XOMA to break down
2304 2018-03-13 00:36:22 How about the fact the market cap of these  5 stocks is bigger than the entire market cap of Russel 2000.
2305 2018-03-13 00:35:31 so the new bts x puma shoes has arrived already and there are few extra stocks still available,,, the thing is, idh enough money to buy it jsdfhkdfjhd
2306 2018-03-13 00:35:22 I wouldn’t be able to show off my sick tech skills in hand warmers or in between stocks anymore 
2307 2018-03-13 00:34:27 taking nintendo’s from the back room and stocks
2308 2018-03-13 00:34:09 And here, @NRA doesn't even want Bump stocks banned.  That position confirms just how irresponsible they are, a THREAT to society and yes, a terrorist supporting organization.
2309 2018-03-13 00:33:24 Bump stocks have nothing to do with anything.

Get real.
2310 2018-03-13 00:31:36 Bump stocks can be fitted on them, so it might be illegal to even own one in some states. Fully automatic ones are definitely banned in all 50 states and territories.
2311 2018-03-13 00:31:23 @maddow @realDonaldTrump @SenWarren @marcorubio #PresObama had Higher S&P Stocks his last year in Office than #PresTrump's First Year
2312 2018-03-13 00:31:06 Yet all those bump stocks and AR-15s still couldn't do more damage than a truck in Nice, France. 86 dead and hundreds injured in about 5 minutes.

2316 2018-03-13 00:26:06 Yer and I am sure there will be stocks of this on the black market as well as at Portion Down not far from this unproven Russian attack good job we have RT as it balances out our own state propaganda channel.the BBC which also slates our party leader.
2317 2018-03-13 00:25:20 I had facebook and sold it, thought about buying Netflix in 09 but didn't...SMFH
2318 2018-03-13 00:23:46 BUMP STOCKS OUT IS GUN CONTROL. NO GUN CONTROL @realDonaldTrump @GovGreitensMO
2319 2018-03-13 00:23:09 If you're a swing trader you're going to step to the plate and swing at what the market throws you. Having a good batting average is nice, but it's hard to win without any home runs.
#stocks #trading #tradingpsychology
2320 2018-03-13 00:22:59 Doesn't really matter to me but now that @Stash has individual stocks, rolling with buffett stands as the only stock not listed as aggressive and is only listed with the ETF's. Is this going to change?
2321 2018-03-13 00:21:38 Yes, guns are responsible for 73% of homicides while hammers are responsible for 0.02%. Thanks for reminding us all that #GunControl is more than just AR-15s and bump stocks. 

Very brave of you. Don't worry, hammers are mostly harmless.
2322 2018-03-13 00:21:10 This isn’t college. This isn’t a relationship. This isn’t a bank. This isn’t a home. This is stocks. Risk is the name , strategy is the game. But yes I agree.
2323 2018-03-13 00:20:15 $HMNY $AMD $ROKU  There's a time to be patient (on good stocks) and a time to just not be there on bad stocks. Yes these really can go lower
2324 2018-03-13 00:19:47 The 2A gives us the right to own a gun, that is all. Amunitation,bump stocks, high capacity mags or anything else that is not naturally part of the gun  or is used to enhance gun itself is not mentioned under the 2A, so therefore is not protected under the 2A. IHMO.
2325 2018-03-13 00:17:52 A system that will allow one who is about to get overlapped in stocks and percent sounds dope. Rage was my least favorite mechanic next to tripping and that extreme vertical vector DI we had before.

We'll have flashier matches for sure if we had final smashes w/o item activation
2326 2018-03-13 00:16:19 Hey Rekt Stocks thanks for the follow!
2327 2018-03-13 00:15:57 Bump stocks do nothing to one defend themselves. It is an add-on device that does nothing but mimic a more rapid fire semiautomatic action.
2328 2018-03-13 00:15:43 So does trading / holding these stocks but I am still here waiting waiting for the Monty Python moment...
2329 2018-03-13 00:15:29 Kasich didn't say much other than getting rid of bump stocks and educate for conceal and carry. He then leaves it up to Congress. Others are right about public education.
2330 2018-03-13 00:15:25 I have 2 issues with Trump. His pos on Syria where we should ne be involved and his failing to fully defend the 2nd Amend by "Shall Not Infringe" which his calling for Federal Ban of bump stocks and Fed Laws on gun ownership in free states is not good. But minor at this point
2331 2018-03-13 00:12:58 @MickMulvaneyOMB I ask don’t approve the President’s ban on bump stocks. Don’t allow them to rewrite what constitutes a machine gun. Bump stocks are not machine guns b/c it’s still allows the rifle to fire 1 pull of the trigger thus keeping it a semi-auto. #ShallNotBeInfringed
2332 2018-03-13 00:12:50 Bump stocks not used at Parkland, FL school shooting. NO assault weapons in the hands of citizens. They are military weapons of war. No assault weapons does not mean taking away all guns. People delusional on this issue
2333 2018-03-13 00:12:25 @maddow @Lawrence @MSNBC The easy task of Trump writing an executive order to ban bump stocks has been done, right?
2334 2018-03-13 00:12:03 @allinwithchris John Kasich just said that banning machine guns was ineffective then pats himself on the back for wanting to ban bump stocks..... 

MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.

That's greedy theiving Capitalism for yah
2336 2018-03-13 00:11:32 Don’t focus on price going up or down short term.  Ask yourself is the stock cheap compared to future earning power? #stocks #StockMarket
2337 2018-03-13 00:11:29 The bump stocks do not but need to be outlawed nothing on guns or to be outlawed.
You're taking a strike against the Constitution mr. President you need to stop it. You're wanting to run in 2020 you don't need that.
2338 2018-03-13 00:10:43 Maybe they plan on buying more than just stocks in July
2339 2018-03-13 00:09:22 What we have seen is your dad tell children & families who were victims of horrifying gun violence that he wasn’t afraid of the NRA & he would make sure the age to purchase would be raised & no bump stocks at minimum. He did neither. He lies & deflects.
2340 2018-03-13 00:08:58 I'm with you 99% 
Why are bump stocks included in this?  I don't own one, or anything that could be fitted with this.!?
Why is so important that OUR rights be taken away?
2341 2018-03-13 00:07:43 I am sorry to hear you ate giving those wack a doos anything. Bump stocks are no.more dangerous than scissors
