40 2018-05-25 23:36:53 "people should be allowed to have guns just not guns made to kill (military guns)" How do you expect that to happen without any kind of background check and by just banning bump stocks..?

Meanwhile if your wages went up, your health ins will eat it.
80 2018-05-25 23:06:31 The people got shit! Companies are using their tax cuts to buy back their stocks at record rates.  Those that aren’t doing that are funding capital expenditures at overseas plants and are using the GOP tax scam proceeds to grow foreign jobs.

85 2018-05-25 23:03:39 For all we know those investors who sold their stocks in KLSE in recent times could have been used for window dressing by Najib & Co to prop up market just for PRU14 - good riddance to such gamblers. Maybe CIMB could be behind this speculative activities too incl Rgt trading.

90 2018-05-25 22:57:47 It appears that Jacob knows as much about Obama as he knew about managing stocks. What a sad little kid!
91 2018-05-25 22:57:44 Banning bump stocks I am for. Automatic weapons are illegal and in my opinion bump stocks are a way around that so they should be banned. However the ATF under Obama made them legal to sell which I do have a problem with. Trump should ban bump stocks which I’d be very happy with.
92 2018-05-25 22:57:10 Rick Scott raised age limit for guns to 21 & banned bump stocks. Also anyone who gets prescription for Marijuana tricked into losing 2A, plus 2 school shootings after he passed law allowing Satanic Prayer at school rallies...

95 2018-05-25 22:56:21 How about universal background checks and banning sales of bump stocks?  Keeping guns out of the hands of convicted felons and those with serious mental health problems.  Those are among the proposals.  Do your homework.
96 2018-05-25 22:52:23 You hear news about the Obamas getting a multi-year contract with netflix to do documentaries on elections/diversity etc.?

133 2018-05-25 22:14:52 Don't worry about the meeting,  worry about why is gas up to 3 dollars? why is  health care up? Why are the stocks down, why is credit more expensive? That's important

146 2018-05-25 21:59:16 We want #GunControlNow not banning guns. We will need them lest OUR Government should rise up against us. BTW that seems to be happening NOW. We want common sense gun control. Trigger locks/fingerprint i.d. Ban bump stocks. No conceal & carry across State lines. Raise the age 1/2

150 2018-05-25 21:51:15 Markets are myopic and cannot see the future with much clarity. Hence its valuations of stocks are influenced by short-term & psychological factors!!

Beware of management that may be tempted to maximize short-term profits to the detriment of long-term strategy!!

151 2018-05-25 21:51:01 The man who could move the GOP to hate McCain, can not/will not move the GOP to even ban bump stocks.

154 2018-05-25 21:50:24 Realized that it was one minute after four when Dollarflow did not reflect the selling.

dollarflow is generated off of live trade tickets on cash traded stocks so doesn’t update past 4:00 PM. Which is why we removed the tweet
155 2018-05-25 21:48:56 Uncontrolled gun laws. I support background checks, and a ban on bump stocks which were used in the Vegas Shooting. I also support mental health funding. Notice how Shootings started 20 years ago. It was a cultural shift.

157 2018-05-25 21:48:28 I feel that alot of the older voters especialy the ones that recall the shoddy chance of the 70s. My mother didn't vote in 2014 as she felt there was just no point.

168 2018-05-25 21:40:05 World stocks mixed but little changed: US -.2%. Europe +.1%. Political uncertainty hangs heavy over markets both in US & overseas. Any short-term predictions are wild ass guesses. Faith in economy likely to be rewarded in 2018-19.
169 2018-05-25 21:39:30 Sell NETFLIX stocks immediately...
170 2018-05-25 21:39:12 #2, See above. Stocks only affect the wealthy positively and aren't a valid number for economic strength. Even if it's one who manipulates the market with tweets. It's more nuanced and you're full of shit if you think otherwise.
171 2018-05-25 21:39:01 If you want to buy $100,000 in stocks you need $100,000 and if you want to buy $100,000 in #realestate you only need $20,000 (20% down). #CRE #investing
172 2018-05-25 21:38:24 1. They typically go public when they are expanding and growing 2. They aren’t required, not every big company has stocks 3. Because they are giving the company their money to grow or improve their company. This is really some basic ass shit.

177 2018-05-25 21:35:15 Blanket #GunControl statement,  AGAIN. So which of the proposals would have stopped this shooting?

178 2018-05-25 21:34:56 Actually most shareholders aren't the ones who bought the stocks in the first place.  They instead buy them on a secondary market for much higher than they were originally sold. Companies end up having to pay out far more than they will ever receive from their own stock.
179 2018-05-25 21:34:03 Markets over past few weeks or month or so have stopped going down esp. in jr stocks. Most carnage has been, on a selective basis in the bitcoin mining, block chain and marijuana sectors. The best sector has been energy and selectively in other resources.

191 2018-05-25 21:30:00 The wealthy few who push for deregulation are the ones who swoop in and buy up failed properties and stocks at rock bottom prices when everything crashes. They know they are causing a crash - they want it that way.  They thrive on our pain.
192 2018-05-25 21:29:13 Every time I get wasted I end up buying stocks . Awful habit.
193 2018-05-25 21:29:12 Just seems like stocks with a lot of social media action tend to pump for a week or two and then decline severely. I’d already be caught chasing and in my experience, the moment you pull the trigger thinking it’ll go up, it starts dying.
194 2018-05-25 21:29:04 Okay, they can do that....But they have to agree to rewrite the 2A eliminating Assault Rifles, bump stocks and 10+ bullet magazines. Sounds fair to me...

253 2018-05-25 20:29:11 I realized the other day that stocks are all about debt. Think about it. Stocks are just debt we carry and that companies can default on, pretty much without penalty. We lose-lose. A good economic portfolio is sustainable, sensible, resistant to losses from unsecured debt.

267 2018-05-25 20:15:18 Ban the NFL, NRA, Assault weapons, bump stocks, all money in politics; engagement training for all cops, release all non-violent offenders, legalize all drugs, separate all boys into advanced social studies, stop sending kids to prison-looking schools, revamp entire education
268 2018-05-25 20:14:56 Bump stocks are a gimmick. They cause wild shots and are nearly useless in a defensive situation.

One moron may have used them to kill.  Everyone else didn't.

Gun banners see that as an excuse to ban it.
269 2018-05-25 20:14:37 No, but my son has.  It was horrible.
270 2018-05-25 20:13:39 Laughing stocks. "Never mind, my boss can't make up his mind."
271 2018-05-25 20:12:39 I have to admit this weeks knock has brought me back to my senses in that the value of stocks can fall from time to time  after three years of good times it’s even refreshing
272 2018-05-25 20:11:33 In long stocks investments isn't enough to find good growing companies, you also need to identify whether it is over or sub valued.
273 2018-05-25 20:11:01 @rpic @480stock what happened was a targeted set of shorts by money managers against all Canadian weed stocks. They pumped and then shorted
274 2018-05-25 20:10:44 Well, wasn't a good day today for my stocks, holding $BPT, $XPL and $MLNT. $-53 for the week. Still holding a $30 buy call for July on $BPT and holding a $7.50 buy call on $MLNT for June. These charts still look good overall. OPEC screwing with oil futures lol
275 2018-05-25 20:08:05 U.S. stocks close mostly lower but book weekly gains
276 2018-05-25 20:07:56 He doesn't grasp that bump stocks, sans possible involvement in Vegas, have not been part of any multiple casualty or victim events. It was political posture for Sittenfeld to use for his mayoral campaign.
277 2018-05-25 20:06:58 Stocks end mostly, but modestly, lower as bond yields and oil slump. 
Dow -58, -0.2% to 24,753.
Nasdaq +0.1%, S&P -0.2%.

Mkt is up for the week: Dow +0.2%, Nasdaq +1.1%, S&P +0.3%
278 2018-05-25 20:06:30 Know all too many people who are convinced they will see the yellow flags waving in time so they can get out with their gains (esp in FAANGs) before any tides recede or tsunamis strike (also know many who shun stocks but are up to eyeballs in leverage on RE investment properties)

281 2018-05-25 20:03:49 Ban high capacity mags, ban bump stocks, ban AR type semi auto rifles. Universal background check, no fucking private sales without background check. Make all weapons purchase age minimum of 21.
282 2018-05-25 20:03:48 Its early in the process. I have to agree, i dont see any good reasons for assault rifles & bump stocks.

289 2018-05-25 19:56:57 Donc, l'an dernier quand ils ont renouvelé les stocks, c'était bien en cas où les "concertations" échouent, c'était juste pour le quinquennat.
290 2018-05-25 19:56:46 Think we may see inflation shock coming.  If so #cash going to be a very bad investment.  #stocks usually pretty good inflation hedge.  #Bonds not so good.  #Realestate will be good since Property owners can increase rents.  #investing
291 2018-05-25 19:56:05 Worth a quick check: 5/21 seems to have been a widespread closing swing high for over 50% of liquid stocks. Closing stats will give the up to date number. $spy
292 2018-05-25 19:55:48 Funny that the oil sector stocks don’t rise much when the oil price goes from  $60 to $80 but crap out when it goes from $80 to $76.......

304 2018-05-25 19:44:10 No real compelling evidence of the snapback today that marked the last two sessions, but NASDAQ is higher, and above earlier lows made this morning-  Breadth still mixed, but well more volume into Down v UP stocks to the tune of about 2.5/1, with Energy being very hard hit $XLE
305 2018-05-25 19:42:35 big fear of mine is I’ll accidentally post a Facebook story instead of an Instagram story and my 32 aunts will know my weekend activities don’t include attending mass and buying stocks
306 2018-05-25 19:41:39 Its a long weekend so most #DayTraders #Traders don't hold position but if you are an #Investor then buy stocks like $NSPR @$1.27 fearlessly like me

313 2018-05-25 19:36:21 Yes, it's the 1920 all over again. A big jump in the deficit coupled with lower taxes. Pulling money from the middle and lower classes. Stocks flying high until the economic engine begins to sputter. Bubbles burst, businesses fail, massive layoffs. Then its the 1930s. Great Again
314 2018-05-25 19:35:57 Thank you!  Quite a few good dividend stocks to choose from at the moment!

$USEI $GMGI $AAGC $CYPE $SWHI
I will wait for $HIHI bottom for re-entry(which may be this zone, has good support)
316 2018-05-25 19:35:07 wish i could have bought Homebase for a £1.  Not only would have sold all the stocks off or given it away but the land holdings too.  Whilst i would have ensured I was looked after for the rest of my days, I would also have been very generous in donating - doubt this will happen
317 2018-05-25 19:33:52 I wish you had been one of my teachers.

319 2018-05-25 19:33:11 True. lalo pag cumulative. At 5% interest (a very minimal earning above inflation rate), it's 1M+. E ang banks around 13% interest. It can climb to 11M+. Had Debbie invested it in stocks, mas malaki pa pwede nya makuha. Lugi talaga sya sa 1.5M.

PS. Pardon me, I'm a nerd. 
320 2018-05-25 19:32:50 $CYPE 0.42 Up 200+% Today, how much more can this go...another 100% to 200%???? is it worth the risk! as i have mentioned before..Today's PR needs to be confirmed! Good luck to all traders!

323 2018-05-25 19:29:39 Mortgage rates are up, gas costs a lot more, helping all your oil & gas buddies here & overseas, corporation are buying back stocks rather than putting the $ into wage increases -- the small tax cuts won't make up for how much more we'll have to pay as we also head into inflation

328 2018-05-25 19:25:50 Is Trump bragging about it yet like he did with the NK summit that never was?  You don't understand the first thing about the stock market and wouldn't know how to research it to educate yourself.  You look like you invest all of your extra cash into which stocks again?  
329 2018-05-25 19:25:49 I agree stocks are better than bonds.  Bonds also carry inflation risk, which is considerable given the dollar’s problems (international movement away from $ and the US structural fiscal deficit).
330 2018-05-25 19:24:03 If you buy your significant other stocks/crypto currency. That’s like on a whole different level, in my opinion.
331 2018-05-25 19:22:27 #Stocks mixed as #Crude takes biggest fall in a year! #Investors weigh geopolitical fears amid Korea, trade i ssues! #Treasuries rise with the #USD!
332 2018-05-25 19:21:34 Sure, I talk openly to my subscribers about stocks that come up short all the time.  You were a subscriber, so you should know this.  But you've got a point, maybe I'll show losers every once in a while on this Twitter page.

400 2018-05-25 18:30:41 it’s not uncommon to see people that dont know how to invest/do their taxes/stocks, yes it’s a very valuable tool but it can be learned when you want to know it. ie: school, but manners and respect and all that stuff is something you need to grow up with and dont just learn later
401 2018-05-25 18:30:22 Just throwing this out there but anybody interested in learning how to trade? I'm considering starting a "class" to teach you the ins and out of trading in stocks,currency,and long term investing

425 2018-05-25 18:14:43 Thinking that yield drop was caused by Fed mins and lower than expected inflation risk, should be friendly to stocks
426 2018-05-25 18:13:52 Omg! The stupidity never ends here.
OK, the amount of a tax break avg American see is pennies. It doesn't even  cover the huge increase in gas prices. Btw, thanks trump. Businesses are buying back stocks to boost invester gains with NO employee benefit. Kool-aid... Mmmm.. Good!

Explain the valuation of a #cryptocoin? 

Stocks i get. There is dividend. A product with a price. A growthpath. Easy to calculate. 

Bonds? Easy. Fix rate. 

Options? Easy. Stockprice x time /100

But crypto? Why is say iota 1,30. And not 0,02 or 125,40. I dont get the Logic.

657 2018-05-25 15:38:30 @AliVelshi Lowest labor part rate since 1977; LOW affordability for housing, college, health; sluggish GDP; Cred card, auto, student loan debt & defaults rising; skilled workers struggle to change jobs.

661 2018-05-25 15:37:13 My feet are on their last legs and I urgently need to get another pair of your “rant” pumps. Any idea who stocks them in the UK? @MerrellUK
662 2018-05-25 15:36:58 well usually after the news is released, the 8k will be released in a day or 2 so maybe next week Tuesday or Wednesday the latest
663 2018-05-25 15:36:57 And if you can't buy a pistol you can't buy a rifle, also the assault wraps ban only took away mag capacity and bump stocks not the rifle itself. Also there is no such thing as an assault rifle that term was brought forth by Hitler when he disarmed the public.
664 2018-05-25 15:36:32 European stocks going out on something of a whimper after a good start..
665 2018-05-25 15:36:26 not doubt he is pretty huge! Can we confirm such news? 8-K is needed as it's PINK current now!
666 2018-05-25 15:36:25 European stocks going out on something of a whimper after a good start..
667 2018-05-25 15:36:13 RT Wealth_Park "nid_rockz Yes, and that's why I sold them. Stocks become expensive because of  euphoria in market participants and should be sold when they become expensive. It is as simple as that!"
668 2018-05-25 15:35:13 Its being reported on CNBC. I'm sure an 8K is in the works.
669 2018-05-25 15:34:46 But not all instruments. You're not running signals on the vix holdings so you'd perform better on individual stocks or indexes. Vix is unlike other ETFs

674 2018-05-25 15:33:10 But what if there is not enough stock to buy back? I guess short seller will loose, and long investor would be left out w/o Tesla stocks. I do not think this is a good practice, unless your intention is to manipulate market for a while.
675 2018-05-25 15:33:03 o&g stocks very resilient ah. sime also
676 2018-05-25 15:32:33 true, however wall street hierarchy has staged ten months of scamming investors and IRAs by shorting then mass selling of their CLIENT'S stocks and funds thereby pocketing gains for themselves, all done in the face of great earnings and forecasts for 3Q, SCAM! Remember 2008 scum!
677 2018-05-25 15:31:45 $CYPE is PINK current and they must file 8-K for such news! Watching closely!
678 2018-05-25 15:31:11 Analysis the fundamentals of company with low debt and moderate PE and always hedge the portfolio. Buy when the quality stocks r down and hedge it , we never know the plan of bigger investor 4 both ways.
679 2018-05-25 15:30:25 Not sure! but such huge #news needs to be verified by an 8-K IMO
680 2018-05-25 15:30:17 Stocks are down, gas prices are up, Puerto Rico still has problems, Flint has no water and you just spread fear and chaos. That’s not leading. That’s just having hysterics like a weak little child.

690 2018-05-25 15:25:28 Personally I'd like to see bump stocks banned.

692 2018-05-25 15:24:40 It is almost as if US stocks are operating in a different universe to everything else
693 2018-05-25 15:24:21 Wall Street slips as oil slump drags energy stocks: (Reuters) - The S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were slightly lower on Friday as a steep drop in oil prices pressured energy stocks.
694 2018-05-25 15:24:16 Many of the public sector bank stocks are going down daily a matter of concern
695 2018-05-25 15:24:14 The fundamental and technical analysis from Stokpix are another two data points in your research armoury.  There are a lot of stocks out there and the analysis results show you where to focus your research saving you time.
696 2018-05-25 15:24:13 Praisin’ Jesus!
697 2018-05-25 15:24:00 ...and how many times has the Fed played this game; stocks at all time highs they talk a hawkish game. But as soon as volatility pushes up, housing weakens, yield curve flattens/inverts,  the doves cry and they do nothing. Don’t be so bold to call the top of a 38 year up trend.
698 2018-05-25 15:22:45 64% of people own their homes, 54% own stocks, and the US has nearly 30 million small businesses. So depending on your definition of private property, you're looking at between maybe a quarter and two-thirds of the population suffering even if there is no capital destruction

722 2018-05-25 15:13:29 @ICICIPruMF I am baffled as to why the fund managers are not allocating more weight to high performing  I.T. stocks such as TCS in the portfolio of ICICI Pru Equity and Debt fund. Infosys is included but you guys really need to allocate more to TCS as well..

725 2018-05-25 15:12:23 He should have been stopped by a background check. Both of them slipped through the cracks. I'm not aware of any previous violence by the Las Vegas shooter but a ban on bump stocks and a limit on magazine/clip capacity could have lessened the damage.
726 2018-05-25 15:12:18 Let's not forget that no other ethnic group has ever been treated worse than blacks, enslaved longer than blacks, capitalism built upon the backs of blacks, Wall Street invented to trade black slaves as stocks in bondage, or that EVERYONE wants us to move on & forget black slaves
727 2018-05-25 15:12:14 "ending your big tax cuts"...Yeah, my taxes actually went up because of the lost interest deduction. But the good news is that corporations are making billions in ADDITIONAL profits which they're using to buy back stocks. Thanks again for that, Mr. Dennison.
728 2018-05-25 15:10:57 People talk about Treasuries, as if they are stocks.

Bonds cannot provide indefinite principle appreciation.  They are priced, based on relative yield.

That they are falling in value is a natural function of improving economic circumstances. 

Too many traders

791 2018-05-25 14:36:40 This is the point right here. Trump said he was going to ban bump stocks and you blindly took his word for it. You have to be better informed.
792 2018-05-25 14:36:31 well most magazines r 30 rounds & its not an automatic weapon. its not shooting 50 rds in a minute.  bump stocks r questionable. ive got 1 but its not on my ar becasue i dont feel its necessary but it shouldnt b taken away. plus its hard 2 find a range that will allow u 2 use it.

794 2018-05-25 14:36:17 Where do you put your new money? In a bank or in stocks or in bonds. Even if it's just a checking account, a bank lends that money to small businesses like yours in biz loans. That's how commercial banks work. Those businesses create jobs.

969 2018-05-25 13:29:24 The statement about "statistically cheap stocks" in the article is about value as a factor in an index fund. It has nothing to do with value as an analytical style.

1180 2018-05-25 11:14:52 Because the Labour Party at Westminster need Scottish MPs to form a government. As Red Tories  they want the oil revenues, the renewables benefits, the water stocks and a home for Trident. Hegemony afflicts all Brit parties in Westminster it’s in the DNA Time to go
1181 2018-05-25 11:13:43 Oh yeah -- gas prices soaring, companies closing, wages flat for years.... Stocks are up temporarily due to companies/1% individuals using their tax windfall to buyback stocks. It's an artificial bubble. When it bursts we'll be in worse shape than 2008. It's all smoke & mirrors

Using SPY to determine market shifts. In your vid (2/9/18) SPY hits support at 1:40 & reverses. So does FB, NVDA, TWTR

Is SPY reversing bc those stocks are reversing or are those stocks reversing bc of the SPY?

1234 2018-05-25 10:25:46 yes, for sure. And that was a huge move on their part, but the policy talk remains narrowly focused on bump stocks, raising the age to purchase, etc, and not on alleviating root causes of gun violence in urban poor Black communities.

1789 2018-05-25 01:34:43 Very well said. My mother used to always say ' mare bina swarg nahee dikta'. Exactly what you are saying. But how do we translate this into stocks?
1790 2018-05-25 01:33:40 Republicans have the $ and our boycotts work!   NRA stocks up, Netflix stocks down.
1791 2018-05-25 01:32:56 Okay google how do I tell girls at the bar how well my stocks are doing without sounding like a douche?
1792 2018-05-25 01:32:00 Besides, I mean, I would still rather live in a world WITH Stock x than without. I feel that  when you buy shoes just to wear them and don’t treat them like actual stocks, you are less invested in things like that anyways. Pun intended btw

1798 2018-05-25 01:26:47 An asset doesn't mean just money sitting in a bank account. It's things worth money. Physical cash, real Estate, stocks, bond, expensive jewelry, etc. They also have 2 major ongoing operations (Haiti and Nicaragua) that they've probably earmarked money for, plus future projects

1802 2018-05-25 01:21:34 Is there any stat showing what % of stocks whose mktcap has jumped 50-100X in the last 10 years? ( say from 100cr to 5000-10000cr)
Unless the % is reasonable, hunting for multi baggers is like searching for a needle in a haystack.

"wiggle" means may move up down or stay flat on recent "talk" or disclosures.
1805 2018-05-25 01:15:45 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your depression
1806 2018-05-25 01:15:22 Hi Gregory, just listened to your buddy G. Hunters podcast with M. Armstrong, MA contradicts your version of higher % rates having a negative effect on stocks.  He believes higher bonds & higher stocks on horizon.  If you watch it, would be great/interesting to hear your thoughts
1807 2018-05-25 01:15:07 Corporations taking tax cuts to buy back stocks, not to hire workers, and moving manufacturing off shore.
Harley Davidson announcement is tip of the iceberg. More will come, and will be gouged more and more by big fossil fuels. The HUGE tax cut for real America is smoke/mirrors
1808 2018-05-25 01:14:06 But that is argumentative, as Facebook and YouTube are also public companies with stocks. They also set standards for how they want their business to be perceived much like the NFL. Hence why I say these kinds of semantics are just ways the establishment chips away at our 1st

1813 2018-05-25 01:07:33 You know that isn't how it works. Some Companies have stocks and shares they're run by a few people on huge salaries and have massive amounts of power.
Not all companies are run like this. But sure many are. It doesn't mean they're any less toxic to this world we live in.

1833 2018-05-25 00:44:31 I was talking ban on all guns.

For now I don't agree with a total ban on ARs. Make them harder to obtain. Same with suppressors.

Bump stocks are functionally useless (IMO). What situation would you need 30 rounds like the military does?
1834 2018-05-25 00:43:59 Little guys? I’ve been trading for almost 30 years. I rarely post what I actually do on twitter. You’d be surprised of my nest egg. I’m 90% in dividend stocks. Every profit from a trade I put in a dividend stock. Been doing it many years. Carry on!

1936 2018-05-26 23:45:45 @davidhogg111 

I'm a proud owner of several bump stocks.   Come and try to take 'em Hog.
1937 2018-05-26 23:45:40 I can find ZERO reason anyone would need a rapid fire weapon outside of the military. BAN BUMP STOCKS!
1938 2018-05-26 23:45:38 The only purpose of bump stocks is very rapid fire similar to an automatic weapon. Of no use for hunting, home defence, or sport shooting. Not banning guns here, just ridiculous malicious "toys" for out of control angry people. Ban them!
1939 2018-05-26 23:45:13 Yes, please ban bump stocks. I have a right to bare arms—I’m wearing a sleeveless top right now. But no one needs to bear bump stocks.
1940 2018-05-26 23:44:42 Cyclical stocks are characterized not only by cyclical demand but also by a high ratio of fixed to variable costs, meaning small FLUCTUATIONS in revenues are AMPLIFIED into much bigger variations in profits.

Example #airlines have very low variable costs of filling empty seats!
1941 2018-05-26 23:44:02 Yes! Ban bump stocks! Save Lives!
1942 2018-05-26 23:43:57 We must ban bump stocks, tightly regulate the gun market, protect our children and women....#GunControlNow #ProtectOurChildren #NeverAgain
1943 2018-05-26 23:43:55 Time is NOW to buy Irish abortion stocks!!

1945 2018-05-26 23:43:23 Bump stocks are dangerous to all gun owners.

1946 2018-05-26 23:43:04 Ban bump stocks. They are unnecessary and deadly. It is insane to legalize them. Do it or forget your political career.

Ban bump stocks & Sensible gun control!  All of you young people are fantastic at leading the wave of people joining battle for this. Thanks so much.
1957 2018-05-26 23:39:32 What stocks? Do I believe in company stocks in SPY? sure. Do I believe in pink sheets company? not so much.
If trusting the issuers is not a problem why are you not building the ledger on their side? Just build some open source software with a nice API and an exchange to trade.
1958 2018-05-26 23:39:15 This is an easy fix. Ban bump stocks #banbumpstocks

1983 2018-05-26 23:34:28 Ban bump stocks
1984 2018-05-26 23:34:20 Bump stocks are an artificial method of turning a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic. By definition it is altering the weapon illegally. Why is this even an argument?
1985 2018-05-26 23:33:58 Bump stocks need banned. 
#BanBumpStocks
1986 2018-05-26 23:33:55 WE need to more than just ban bump-stocks. We need to ban killing machines on our streets

1989 2018-05-26 23:33:37 That person is missing the part where it was his wife who was in charge of the stocks and made those decisions. Hell, Genna was the CEO of the company, he worked for her.
1990 2018-05-26 23:33:37 Stop the shootings by banning bump stocks
1991 2018-05-26 23:33:29 Unfortunately that is one weapon we can’t do much about, nobody is going to ban cars, the difference being they have a real world purpose, which some guns simply do not, as well as bump stocks...
1992 2018-05-26 23:33:24 stocks?
1993 2018-05-26 23:32:58 We need to get rid of the bum stocks st the very least.
1994 2018-05-26 23:32:40 So you don’t believe in stocks?

Either you do or don’t.  If you do believe in stocks then you automatically trust the issuer.  All other discussion about issuer trust is irrelevant because it’s not even a problem— let alone a problem in need of a solution.

2010 2018-05-26 23:29:33 I’m not completely against them either, I just want them, especially those with no real world purpose (bump stocks fit that perfectly) to be controlled and or banned and outright destroyed. Some have purpose, they can be kept...
2011 2018-05-26 23:28:58 Bump stocks are a clear and present danger to our right to life. They must be banned AGAIN!

2080 2018-05-26 23:12:12 Still see you. Yes more bump stocks ought to help. Make them easier to get right? A well armed militia needs bump sticks like the Vegas shooter used.

2095 2018-05-26 23:09:10 Banning bump stocks should be a no-brainer. Of course we should! Too bad the NRA has purchased so many of our “leaders.” #gotembytheshorthairs

2098 2018-05-26 23:08:46 Exactly, and yet they aren’t “protected” under an amendment either, and neither are bump stocks or really even guns... All I want is people to read the amendment before hiding behind it every time this happens...

2105 2018-05-26 23:07:46 The opening line on the Gifford website is not accurate  - I’m guessing that is by design 

“Bump stocks turn a semi-automatic weapon into a machine gun.”

Also - comments generated do enact law - so this is really just a ploy to generate web traffic - or click bait
2106 2018-05-26 23:07:44 Beyond the shadow of any doubt bump stocks should be BANNED it seems to me too. . .

2119 2018-05-26 23:04:55 @EmpSteveVH hey Steve another Tim Sykes follower from Alberta. Hey buddy if you trade what brokerage do u use for US Stocks/Penny Stocks thanks
2120 2018-05-26 23:04:49 First, it would be an ATF rule that would ban bump stocks, no law required. Second, more than 38,000 have already commented, while 0.0001% of the US pop would be 325. Do yourself a big favor and review %'s . Hint: you forgot to multiply by 100 to get %.
2121 2018-05-26 23:04:44 We don’t need bump stocks or assault rifles
2122 2018-05-26 23:04:43 Ban bump stocks
2123 2018-05-26 23:04:22 There’s no need whatsoever for these bump stocks!
2124 2018-05-26 23:04:06 Ban those killing bump stocks.  Only good for murder.
2125 2018-05-26 23:03:57 Ban bump stocks and all assault rifles.  Keep going we are with you.
2126 2018-05-26 23:03:55 Get rid of bump stocks forever!
2127 2018-05-26 23:03:49 Ban bump stocks!

2129 2018-05-26 23:03:28 Talk about a baby step! Ban bump stocks! It’d literally be the least Congress could do and actually still be doing something.
2130 2018-05-26 23:03:14 Waiting on the day people discover $TSRI like they did $IMTE. It’ll be EPIC. I’m still accumulating for the inevitable monster run on this low floater. #pennystocks #charts #stockmarket #stocks #Daytrader #FinancialFreedom #SwingTrading
2131 2018-05-26 23:03:12 Bull markets make stocks expnsive,expnsive stocks leave litle room 4 error,err increases the odds of bull markets ending.Same thing in the other direction.Recessions cause pessimism.Pessimism causes underproduction, underproduction leads to scarcity, scarcity leads to a new boom.
2132 2018-05-26 23:03:05 None of that. I’ve been reading some comments pro bump stocks that are ridiculous.
2133 2018-05-26 23:02:44 Please ban bump stocks.  Thanks!

2136 2018-05-26 23:02:22 The fact that Congress won’t ban bump stocks is astounding. They value money more than human life. They are not@soing their duty!

2138 2018-05-26 23:02:07 Please ban bump stocks. Innocent lives are being taken from us. Future doctors, scientists, artists, teachers, etc. We need “common sense” gun laws. No one is infringing on the 2nd amendment. Read the Constitution.

2148 2018-05-26 22:59:22 What is ridiculous here, we would rather not have people using an amendment that clearly states the right it affords has a caveat with it that it must be for the purpose of defending a free state and be well regulated, neither of which is the case in the case of bump stocks...

Old film stocks weren’t very forgiving.
2165 2018-05-26 22:55:43 There’s NO good reason for anyone to have access to bump stocks. They turn murder machines into massacre machines. #BanBumpStocks NOW.

2170 2018-05-26 22:55:26 Time for congress to take action and ban bump stocks. Sensible regulations are not a 2A infringement
2171 2018-05-26 22:55:22 Ban bump stocks!
2172 2018-05-26 22:55:20 Ok, I stand corrected, that was from the Declaration of Independence not the Constitution, but Bump Stocks aren’t in either, and I still say Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness should come first over the right to bare arms, especially when it has nothing to do with 2nd Am.
2173 2018-05-26 22:55:15 The young will win. Ban Bump Stocks !

2188 2018-05-26 22:52:48 I realize that you have to start SOMEWHERE, but banning bump stocks is like putting a bandaid on a bullet hole, as they make at least 2 other similar devices! But, I do support ANYTHING which will help. #NeverAgain

2214 2018-05-26 22:47:55 He also brought a glass cutter, suggesting he was in on it. The bump stocks and close combat sights tell me the original plan was to shoot at the concert from ground level, at least with those 14 weapons. It makes sense that shooting at Campos rendered that plan impossible.

2230 2018-05-26 22:45:03 Every time the stock market has declined, it eventually has more than fully recovered. Hedging the stock market by shorting stocks, or by buying puts on the S&P 500 Index, or any other method usually is expensive, and, in the long run, is a waste of money. -- Ed Wachenheim
2231 2018-05-26 22:44:51 Ban bump stocks now!
2232 2018-05-26 22:44:35 Of course, bump stocks must be banned. It’s ludicrous that there is such a thing, in the first place.

2274 2018-05-26 22:32:06 There is no 2A protection for bump stocks. Banning these devices is clearly in the realm of reasonable regulation as specified by Justice Scalia writing in Heller.

2297 2018-05-26 22:29:12 I don’t care for bump stocks myself but I’m not willing to offer my support to any side that would take a mile when you give an inch. Are bump stocks really a problem here? We had an incident with them, a terrible one but we’re not solving crime by attacking this device.
2298 2018-05-26 22:28:56 Apparently you're in a nice safe place. Parents are having their babies ripped out of their arms when they present for asylum in the beacon of hope. Not so safe. 

Economy? S & P stocks up.

2301 2018-05-26 22:28:43 Alors là, j'y connais rien pour être honnête. En revanche ce que je vois, quand j'étais magasinier livreur, j'enregistrais les bons de livraisons (pour les stocks / calcul du coût) avant de les envoyer à la compta qui devait payer. En cas de retard...
2302 2018-05-26 22:28:36 Bump stocks that's your solution good luck on that.  How about security that are not cowards. Or metal detectors.  You kids are the problem
2303 2018-05-26 22:28:31 Reform gun laws and start with banning bump stocks!!! #BanBumpStocks
2304 2018-05-26 22:28:21 Professional School Counselors have taken a stand and we need common sense gun law regulation in order for us to do our jobs. At a minimum banning Bump Stocks at a Nationa wide level is critical #BanBumpStocks
2305 2018-05-26 22:28:11 Ok great so now what are you going to do! You Senators all love the grilling and the show for us - frankly - we want action and results! Be it 1500 kids, DACA, Healthcare, tax relief, medical marijuana, vets help, ban bump stocks, some actual help to stop mass murder of kids!

2307 2018-05-26 22:27:32 I see hateful comments from all sides. The same happened to Obama. I'm happy with economy, low unemployment, high employment, high stocks and lower taxes; I don't care who's responsible. Trump's not demi-god. He's just President as was Obama; right on some things; wrong on others
2308 2018-05-26 22:27:27 If we don't allow people to own live hand grenades, for the same reason, we should not allow people to own bump stocks. #BanBumpStocks and save some innocent lives!!!!

2321 2018-05-26 22:24:05 Where’s the solid proof of him saying he disliked equality,Where’s solid proof of him stating that because they hired more women he pulled stocks. If there isn’t any shut your mouth. I never personally watched him. But those who have the nerves to speak ill of a dead man. Horrid.
2322 2018-05-26 22:23:40 Yes David we cannot let our children's mind be distracted from their studies. Why should they stress about a lock down. We are imposing unnecessary burden's on the impressionable minds of our kids. Ban bump stocks, ban assault rifles.  Do not vote for any recipient of NRA funds.
2323 2018-05-26 22:23:14 Worse than bump stocks are the vile comments about you. What you must think of us adults. As one, I apologize, and offer my admiration.
2324 2018-05-26 22:23:13 I’m glad banning bump stocks would prevent school shootings. Love your logic there
2325 2018-05-26 22:23:06 I’m for banning bump stocks.

2341 2018-05-26 22:18:39 Ban bump stocks!
2342 2018-05-26 22:18:30 Basically his wife pulled stock from Intel because it was profitable, yknow, what people do with stocks.
"against equality" is complete bullshit, likely because of his otherkin/toast joke.

2353 2018-05-26 22:16:24 So a theory over lives? And that over bump stocks - a crap tool to skirt around laws governing automatic weapons? Guns should be a tool not a religion.
2354 2018-05-26 22:16:24 We must ban bump stocks!!
2355 2018-05-26 22:16:11 Ban bump stocks
2356 2018-05-26 22:15:59 While you are at it, let's ban tires, because studies have shown that every fatal DUI crash all had one thing in common... their cars all had tires. So if ya ban tires, we can end DUI deaths, which FAR out number the deaths caused by these "bump stocks". #CommonSenceForTheWin
2357 2018-05-26 22:15:52 There are plenty of good honest law abiding get men and woman who hunt who do not want bump stocks.
They have children in schools across the nation and the world in fact.
#solutionsnotemptyprayers
2358 2018-05-26 22:15:13 Gladly, bump stocks are murder weapons that have been used to massacre hundreds of Americans.  These should have been prohibited years ago.
2359 2018-05-26 22:15:07 Band bump stocks!
2360 2018-05-26 22:14:58 Bump stocks are an unnecessary risk.
2361 2018-05-26 22:14:53 He was passionate, three-dimensional guy. Sure, he fucked up sometimes, but he kept learning. That's why I stayed a fan 'till the end.

Also Alicia is flat-the-fuck out lying. TB wasn't the one shuffling their stocks, and it was done in response to the market.
2362 2018-05-26 22:14:41 Ban bump stocks
2363 2018-05-26 22:14:23 Machine guns are illegal. Bump stocks turn an existing gun into a machine gun. Semantics in the law are why these are allowed to be sold. #banbumpstocks
2364 2018-05-26 22:14:08 Ban bump stocks now!!!!
2365 2018-05-26 22:13:08 Of course we need to ban bump stocks

2371 2018-05-26 22:12:09 Ban bump stocks.
2372 2018-05-26 22:12:06 "It is often perceived that the Democratic Party is less friendly to healthcare companies than the Republican Party, and stocks in the industry will often react to changes in party control of the government."
2373 2018-05-26 22:11:56 Ban bump stocks and ban any @NRA funded candidates.

2379 2018-05-26 22:10:35 Ban bump stocks and all guns.  I'm against killing bear and wolf cubs too.
2380 2018-05-26 22:09:38 In my arms deal theory Paddock thought it was legit & that buyers wanted the guns for entertainment. But they effectively used him as a mule. P may have sold to others in MB & Ogden in that week, maybe using an agent. Bump stocks worked well for being toys. No proof of full-auto

2392 2018-05-26 22:06:39 Millions of dollars to catch one (white!)guy smoking pot out 100k on welfare. The only people who want this are actually the folks with stocks and or friends in the piss-test industry.
2393 2018-05-26 22:06:34 Are you going to ban rubber bands too. For what they cost bump stocks are a waste of money just to simulate full automatic fire if you can perfect the technique. No accuracy. Total waste of ammunition after you make stock work properly.

2399 2018-05-26 22:05:36 That reminds me, Trump called bump stocks horrible and proclaimed his intention to have them banned quickly.  He assembled a crowd from both parties
and played the honest broker of common sense.  Makes fools of everyone who sucks up to and believes in this horrible liar.
2400 2018-05-26 22:05:24 Do u want to marry anyone....  Am up for grabs...

2401 2018-05-26 22:05:14 What is wrong with you @B754344255 you are a horrible person to try and vilify a school student fighting for his rights.  Ban bump stocks-they kill-they are only wanted by many who prefer to harm others.
2402 2018-05-26 22:05:13 Ban bump stocks and every weapon they're used on.
2403 2018-05-26 22:04:52 Loose gun laws enabled by bought and paid for politicians have let corporations make blood money for far too long.  I'm proud to have signed the Pledge not to take NRA money and will fight for common sense gun laws...Including the banning of bump stocks.
#CommonSense
2404 2018-05-26 22:04:41 There is no legitimate use for the average person to have bump stocks.
2405 2018-05-26 22:04:41 You can have your second amendment rights without bump stocks. Ban them now. They should have been banned long ago!

2442 2018-05-26 21:56:40 Down with bump stocks...no brainer.
2443 2018-05-26 21:56:14 I realized after you mentioned that the military uses automatic weapons that they would have no use for bump stocks.
2444 2018-05-26 21:56:05 Banning bump stocks is a good start. Its illogical not to ban them. Let’s not facilitate mass murder.
2445 2018-05-26 21:55:57 Please banbump stocks I have no idea why we are still have talk about this, it’s a no brainer #BanBumpStocks

2480 2018-05-26 21:49:05 Because I’m easily amused by dopey comments and bump stocks are prohibited so nobody will ever ever ever be able to obtain one. 
2481 2018-05-26 21:49:04 Bump stocks are dumb.  Please ban.
2482 2018-05-26 21:48:58 I stand for a ban on bump stocks!
2483 2018-05-26 21:48:49 Ban bump stocks now!
2484 2018-05-26 21:48:32 #BanBumpStocks This is a no-brained. Ban Bump Stocks.
2485 2018-05-26 21:48:30 Ban bump stocks please!  #BanBumpStocks
2486 2018-05-26 21:48:27 I'm so happy and hopeful of the future of the US with you guys speaking out and getting things done. Bump stocks and millitary weapons do not belong to civilians
2487 2018-05-26 21:47:51 *Please* do the right thing and ban bump stocks. #BanBumpStocks
2488 2018-05-26 21:47:50 Ban bump stocks. And register to vote.
2489 2018-05-26 21:47:28 So you don't see unemployment down, stocks up, tax breaks, Isis all but dead, Iran deal dead, DESPITE the democrats fighting every inch of what he's trying to accomplish, you never answered my question, Hillary or Trump?
2490 2018-05-26 21:47:20 Banning bump stocks is a small step on to road of necessary changes.  Yes guns do kill people.  I'll take my chances against a person wielding a knife. I have NO CHANCE against a military style weapon
2491 2018-05-26 21:47:19 I strongly support banning bump stocks. Please take action now.
2492 2018-05-26 21:47:17 Please ban bump stocks,and protect our children!  Enough! Basta!
2493 2018-05-26 21:46:47 And how do you propose that gun violence be stopped?  My suggestions:  raise purchase minimum age to 21, ban bump stocks, ban AR-15s and most importantly, stop taking $ from the NRA.  Do something, prayers are not enough.

2499 2018-05-26 21:45:44 Banning bump stocks is like removing the TV from a house fire. You're getting what you want but you aren't benefiting anyone.

2512 2018-05-26 21:43:36 I asked my BIL and his gf, who crouched behind the tires of a beer truck while bullets landed all around them. They are both gun owners and conservatives. They said weapons like AR15s and accessories like bump stocks should be banned.

2528 2018-05-26 21:41:29 Bump stocks do not fall under the 2nd amendment. They are simply playthings for wannabe "soldiers"

2533 2018-05-26 21:39:33 @drjjr500 #banbumpstocks Why enable crazy ppl 2 shoot faster 2 kill more ppl! Get rid of bump stocks & 50 round magazines! Pass a law with penalties, to make ppl secure their guns or mandatory law to use a trigger lock to stop toddlers killing themselves and thr siblings!

2547 2018-05-26 21:36:32 Ban bump stocks
2548 2018-05-26 21:36:19 Enough is enough.  It’s time, for common sense, gun ownership and responsibility.  Ban bump stocks.

2554 2018-05-26 21:35:03 That article, though about stocks, was spot on!! 
2555 2018-05-26 21:35:03 Bump stocks must be banned
2556 2018-05-26 21:35:02 If they didn’t do things by the book it would have gotten halted yesterday with that volume especially on that news 
Nothing but top notch lawyers investors behind the scenes here 
Couldn’t be more comfortable actually I
2557 2018-05-26 21:34:41 1/ An arms deal would never include bump stocks. Anyone who knows anything about guns knows bump stocks are toys, gimmicks, used by amateurs, not in assault or combat. I can think of one reason for 14 ARs with bump stocks, and that's a ground level turkey shoot by 14 amateurs.
2558 2018-05-26 21:34:22 Gas prices are on the rise & stocks,Dow on the way down because potus is a moron. Canada's gas prices,4 example,are made in the US so with the near constitutional crisis looming, potus actions have caused gas in Canada 2 soar 2 nearly $2 per litre.Cali gas?Direct result of potus.
2559 2018-05-26 21:33:58 Yes! Ban bump stocks!
2560 2018-05-26 21:33:28 Penny stocks (stocks trading at less than $5 per share) are a risky, but with some research potentially huge returning investment.
2561 2018-05-26 21:33:19 Ban bump stocks. No civilian needs such a device.
2562 2018-05-26 21:32:59 Ban bump stocks
2563 2018-05-26 21:32:57 my turn? From Alberta, I made a lot of money trading junior gold stocks in university then lost basically all of it in 2008-09. Clawed my way back and rebuilt my account using options and detailed technical analysis. Strategy has not deviated since.
2564 2018-05-26 21:32:44 Ban bump stocks
2565 2018-05-26 21:32:30 Ban bump stocks!
2566 2018-05-26 21:32:26 We don't need bump stocks  too many innocent people are being killed now with guns without giving those that want to kill the power to kill even MORE.
2567 2018-05-26 21:32:23 *during a discussion of how Obi-wan got 17000 credits to pay Han*

Me - "he was probably like, I had some space stocks that paid out big!"

@sawhite1987 - "he wouldn't call them 'space' stocks, this isn't Harry Potter."
2568 2018-05-26 21:32:16 No bump stocks. No AR-15s. No guns at all until you can prove you are a responsible gun owner. You pass a test, then get a license— and then you’re registered and put on a national list.
2569 2018-05-26 21:31:30 Bump Stocks must be banned. They have no place in a civil society. Save lives and ban them!
2570 2018-05-26 21:31:28 Find yourselves a box of straws and suck it.  I can't wait to hear your explanation for Las Vegas and how banning the sale of bump stocks wouldn't have saved lives.
2571 2018-05-26 21:31:14 You don't even know what bump stocks do other than the Google definition...I don't think they're bad but they're also not necessary
2572 2018-05-26 21:30:59 If you can’t ban bump stocks you will be bumped from office!
2573 2018-05-26 21:30:57 PLEASE BAN Bump Stocks!! Just too many deaths from theses. No More!!
2574 2018-05-26 21:30:53 Right now , oil stocks are loving it , if I m not wrong ..
2575 2018-05-26 21:30:44 Ban bump stocks
2576 2018-05-26 21:30:26 There is absolutely no justification for bump stocks as all they do is make legal (unfortunately) semi-automatic weapons into illegal automatic weapons
2577 2018-05-26 21:30:13 Ban BUMP STOCKS NOW!!
2578 2018-05-26 21:30:09 Banning bump stocks would be a good first step toward saving lives. What is more import - bump stocks or our children?
2579 2018-05-26 21:30:02 Ban bump stocks, so people have a chance to run for their lives. #banbumpstocks

2585 2018-05-26 21:26:52 That could be anything. That would  ban lighter triggers or comfortable stocks
2586 2018-05-26 21:26:06 Dude, bump stocks at best are a gimmick. They are hardly a tool of destruction

2594 2018-05-26 21:24:23 Oh, ye gads, I hate hate the "You gotta have a thick skin!" piece of writing advice.
It's primitive shorthand that demands creative folks stand in the stocks to be pummeled by rotten vegetables.
Truly, it encourages creatives to equate rejection and critique with nastiness.
2595 2018-05-26 21:24:18 You don’t need bump stocks to hunt, or 30 round clips for that matter. #BanBumpStocks
2596 2018-05-26 21:23:17 #BanBumpStocks   A ban on bump stocks is needed. The only point of a bump stock is to allow a semi-automatic to give a more rapid fire. Why are they needed otherwise? Get rid of them.
2597 2018-05-26 21:22:43 Ban bump stocks
2598 2018-05-26 21:22:31 Ban the damned bump stocks.
2599 2018-05-26 21:21:36 No American has a legitimate need for bump stocks. Ban them.
2600 2018-05-26 21:21:07 Without bump stocks, how are we going to shoot down those drones when the gubment comes at us? Or those fighter jets? Or disarm those tanks? Think about it! It's obvious that the 2nd amendment was written with the full expectation of today's world!! /s
2601 2018-05-26 21:20:34 oh absolutely. banning bump stocks is only a small step, but a step in the right direction is still better than nothing (: we have to start somewhere
2602 2018-05-26 21:20:34 Well if you are worried about life, then why not ban all cars, guns, knives, baseball bats, trains, campfires, etc?  700 people die every year at railroad crossings.  I don't hear you trying to ban them.  So why worry about bump stocks?
2603 2018-05-26 21:20:19 Ban Bump Stocks NOW !
2604 2018-05-26 21:20:09 Ban bump stocks!
2605 2018-05-26 21:19:39 Congress.  You can be a bigger hero by banning bump stocks.  You said you'd do it...  So, go!
2606 2018-05-26 21:19:37 You want to ban bump stocks? Go ahead and ban them. Literally myself nor anybody I know that is an avid gun user cares. However, just know that if the Las Vegas shooter hadn't used one, he probably would have killed MORE people. That's right, MORE.
2607 2018-05-26 21:19:29 Naloka najud ko aning stocks ba. Nganong mga tamad man gud ni akong mga sabay mag bilang? Tangina. Magreport skoa dli mao2x. Bntay ra lage ako makabilang ana ba. Bwisit.

2609 2018-05-26 21:18:23 Who cares about bump stocks?!  Only one known incident involving them in history of world.  In the time it took you to tweet about it, someone died due to drunk driving, someone was raped, and someone drug overdosed.  Misguided anger.
2610 2018-05-26 21:18:17 Ban bump stocks !

2615 2018-05-26 21:16:34 I mean... no it doesn’t hurt to try. For me to completely dismiss it is foolish. However, if bump stocks get banned tomorrow, I still think there will be more of these shootings/killings to come.
2616 2018-05-26 21:16:34 Ban bump stocks

2665 2018-05-26 21:07:10 How do comments ban bump stocks?

2670 2018-05-26 21:06:05 I don’t get why it is so difficult for the government to ban bum stocks, it can be done if for once HONESTY and TRUTH is exercise by this administration. Stop hiding behind HYPOCRISY and do the right thing for God Sake!

2677 2018-05-26 21:05:02 Bump stocks should be banned. 100%
2678 2018-05-26 21:04:56 I like stocks like $CELZ and $FUSZ where A. They are in business for a good cause B. In reality the sky is the limit
2679 2018-05-26 21:04:48 Goes without saying! Bump stocks are solely for killing as many people as possible. BAN NOW#BanBumpStocks
2680 2018-05-26 21:04:09 Ok ban bump stocks
2681 2018-05-26 21:04:07 The National Firearms Act of 1934 bans possession of fully automatic weapons. Bump stocks (and other devices such as trigger cranks) exploit technicalities to violate the intent of the law. Yes, #BanBumpStocks, but write the law to ban any device that increases rate of fire.
2682 2018-05-26 21:03:56 No reason in the world to have bump stocks.
2683 2018-05-26 21:03:48 I’m with you, ban the bump stocks!
2684 2018-05-26 21:03:44 @rickcatino  I’m a Massachusetts gun owner. We banned bump stocks effective November 2017... don’t know why it’s so hard to do federally. #BanBumpStocks

2686 2018-05-26 21:03:12 Ban bump stocks now!!!
2687 2018-05-26 21:03:00 Banning bump stocks is the *least* we can do! It's common sense (and those who are truly "responsible gun owners" must surely agree).
#banbumpstocks
2688 2018-05-26 21:02:21 Legislation and change in policy bans bump stocks.  Not comments - they ignore petitions too.
2689 2018-05-26 21:01:58 Bump stocks are evil
2690 2018-05-26 21:01:56 Ban bump stocks. Make permits and training mandatory.
2691 2018-05-26 21:01:43 I vote for the banning of bump stocks immensely.
2692 2018-05-26 21:01:25 Blog #4 with the 70+ PnL’s from 2014-2015 is gonna be SICK.

Best part is all PnL’s are TIME STAMPED!!

You can go back to that exact date on your chart and see why I traded those stocks.

Can’t wait for you guys to see.

Lots and lots of history to be shown!
2693 2018-05-26 21:01:16 Bump stocks have no meaningful purpose besides killing innocent people. #BanBumpStocks

2698 2018-05-26 21:00:48 Bump stocks are ridiculous, and even without them those guns are made for killing people, as many as possible.  I'm for the UK plan of buy backs and strict laws.

2725 2018-05-26 20:58:22 I'm a Canadian but currently in Indianapolis for race weekend so does my comment "Ban Bump Stocks Now" at least half count?
2726 2018-05-26 20:57:37 Trump promised he would ban bump stocks. That was many months ago. Another empty promise from the president. But the young people will win. #BanBumpStocks
2727 2018-05-26 20:57:30 Ban bump stocks now it really is the least you can do
2728 2018-05-26 20:57:22 I support the ban of bump stocks.

2730 2018-05-26 20:55:01 NBA just wants to see GS vs CLE. I want to see Hou vs Bos
2731 2018-05-26 20:52:28 Bump stocks . Lol. Not necessary for bump fire.. I personally have no issues with that except it will set a bad precedent.. would lead to banning more things that have no effect on actual shooting...
2732 2018-05-26 20:51:58 Then of course there's Las Vegas, where a man was legally able to buy and use dozens of military-style assault weapons and equip them with bump stocks to increase the lethal consequences?
2733 2018-05-26 20:51:01 I am watching another Joseph Arcaro shell that might get ready! When ready i will tweet it to my followers!
2734 2018-05-26 20:50:50 @KingJigglypuff Hey, just curious if you would be interested in some new stock icons for Classic Ridley? I make stocks for fun and would make ya some if you would like.
2735 2018-05-26 20:48:49 Is it limited? Bump stocks are an easy and cheap work around for, banned, automatic weapons.
2736 2018-05-26 20:46:15 So instead of a special bar being active heat its going to be a super bar with stocks like a fighting game?

2741 2018-05-26 20:40:08 There is no conceivable justification for bump stocks. Therefore there is no conceivable justification for failure to ban them from sales and ownership. Get with it or get out.
2742 2018-05-26 20:37:52 Well duh!! Tax cuts, security, stocks up!, low unemployment, GDP is up want to keep it up keep republicans in the dems only platform is Russia, a porn star and hating trump!

2745 2018-05-26 20:27:53 Stocks like $AMZN and $BABA are attempting breakouts, but setting up negative divergences that might end up making for more profitable shorts than longs in the coming weeks.  Higher first possible with deeper corrections thereafter.

2760 2018-05-26 20:04:45 Back In February there was a bump stock ban in both NJ and Maryland. Maryland has over 8,000 bump stocks and NJ 5,000 bump stocks. Between both of them, 3 have been turned in. So yes, a gun ban will definitely work.

2763 2018-05-26 20:00:36 The Leftist MSM was only concerned with the fact that an AR-15 carbine and bump stocks were used by that murderous psychotic and their anti-gun propaganda! But whitewashing this information smacks of a possible cover-up but what was the justification?!?
2764 2018-05-26 19:59:41 I’m so pleased that the @sainsburys store where I work now stocks the bigger packs of @Tyrrells Sea Salt & Black Pepper. Subtle enough to not be overpowering yet stronger than just Lightly Salted. And they’re on offer at the moment too!

2777 2018-05-26 19:35:47 Speaking of laughing stocks...
2778 2018-05-26 19:32:57 In traditional asset management diversification (owning 20-40 stocks) reduces risk in a mature market because assets don't all move together (beta value). In crypto, all of the betas are roughly equal, so no, it doesn't work. Cred is correct.
2779 2018-05-26 19:32:28 TRUE, KINDA SAD, FACT: "Unlike the Dover sole, the stocks of lemon sole appear to be in pretty good shape. . .because the quotas of lemon sole that can be caught by commercial vessels are set at sensible, low levels."
2780 2018-05-26 19:30:39 I'd bet bump stocks were gun show purchases. They'd have been able to track if they were online buys.

2793 2018-05-26 19:11:19 I should start investing in stocks. 
2794 2018-05-26 19:10:08 Real estate, like stocks, is historically overvalued imho, will fall in real terms if we get a inflation-induced crash. But rent could skyrocket too. Best option would be to lock in a lease property for the next 5-10 years and then buy cheap. Use funds to buy Silver imho.

2801 2018-05-26 19:03:23 Hi Lee. You start to pick up quickly that there are trolls amongst us via social media that will bash stocks to get what they want.

Unfortunately, we live in a world where almost everyone is only looking out for themselves.

2812 2018-05-26 18:38:44 2/2 my grandpa invests in cannabis industry in Canada only because he sees the correlation to them fully legalizing it first which from an investing standpoint is where he wants his money to go, to canada pot stocks. The US profits hugely from lobbyists, big pharma, alcohol etc
2813 2018-05-26 18:38:35 2 mins of silence for all those buying Vedanta stocks 
2814 2018-05-26 18:37:22 You need to decide u r parameters, like less risk and beat fd. Under that context that is also ok. There are so many stocks and so many ideas. Everyone has to find their way out
2815 2018-05-26 18:35:45 hell yeah sellin my johnson & johnson stocks
2816 2018-05-26 18:33:31 The war machine wants it to fail. Did no one see the stocks fall after the announcement of their meeting?
2817 2018-05-26 18:33:05 What you join is your business. What they support should be your business as well. So do you support the killing of American school children? Are you willing to lose your own child? Support paying higher taxes for protecting schools? Bump stocks?
2818 2018-05-26 18:30:48 The notion that Rees-Mogg ever had 'faith' in May is laughable. He is trying to manoeuvre her into crashing out of the EU without a deal. I assume because he has shorted UK stocks in some way. That May bows to his cynical ploys is utterly predicable and utterly pathetic.
2819 2018-05-26 18:30:14 He deserves public stocks.

2821 2018-05-26 18:27:39 donald trump talking about "laughing stocks of the world" is like a lawnmower talking about shorter grass. 
2822 2018-05-26 18:27:10 Which is why you buy buy buy when stocks are low. Start young and let the money do it's thing
2823 2018-05-26 18:26:04 & we will bring you up on charges - even if we must wait for a while - we know what you have done & you will pay. YOU are the one making us laughing stocks! You should read the world newpapers. They are quite honest. Don't read only Putin's newpapers!

2825 2018-05-26 18:22:18 Where's the Executive order to ban bump stocks?

How about that big meeting about gun control?

Lies

A con man
A bully

Go away
2826 2018-05-26 18:22:14 Staying in Herne Hill, the corner shop stocks this stuff. It's Jamaican import stout and it's lovely. At 7.5% though it deserves respect!
2827 2018-05-26 18:21:52 If graduates unable to pay debt it obviously means college education not worth investment. In our capitalistic system bad investors should suffer!. I had an MBA from Temple in Finance. But I didn't make much money in career. But I made lot of money in stocks. My MBA no bad bet.
2828 2018-05-26 18:21:35 It wont stop, they dont have money for that much stocks
2829 2018-05-26 18:20:16 I need a car . I defiantly need to get focused & really kill these stocks !

2833 2018-05-26 18:17:47 Gold mines are not oil wells. They can't just be shut off. Gold mining stocks are at 25-30 year lows. They were making more money at $300 gold than $1300 gold today. Normally a market finds a new equilibrium before an industry falls off a cliff. & the gold industry did until now.
2834 2018-05-26 18:17:39 The next guy I date should know that I’m up for food at any time of the day. Except when I’m home cuz Amma stocks food everyday and I can’t get out of the house. 
2835 2018-05-26 18:16:47 Unemployment low. Stocks high.  Middle class taxes lowered. Hostages free. Regulations reduced.NoKo meeting possible. Is everything good?  No.Does he tweet too much?  Possibly. But you got to also admit he has had ALOT of success too as MANY foreign and domestic indicators are up
2836 2018-05-26 18:11:13 Yeah failing...the stocks are only higher then the past 5 years. Your war on media is pathetic.
2837 2018-05-26 18:09:41 Worth noting though that the stocks of other defense companies didn't do any worse, even the ones that have no connection to this whatsoever. Now that the initial #Tech boom is over I would imagine that a lot of them are benefiting from the prospect of a dawning #Space age
2838 2018-05-26 18:08:02 @djvlad The first thing you do in the morning is pray or check your stocks?

We know with being jewish its checking your money....do you give to charity? Probably not.

2843 2018-05-26 18:04:21 Why is full auto and bump stocks illegal? It allows to to fight off large numbers of people quickly. Now ask yourselves, who is going to burst into your homes in large numbers, quickly?
2844 2018-05-26 18:03:38 Hey El, Some of our Happy Meal toys are very popular which means we run out of toys before the offer ends. We do try to let our customers know that the toys are only available ‘while stocks last’ we understand that this may be disappointing when you don't receive your toy.
2845 2018-05-26 18:02:00 Nah if anything they are the moguls that want to keep gas a thing to help their stocks
2846 2018-05-26 18:00:25 Most wealth is built with more than just stocks. New regulations have opened many new and exciting possibilities other than stocks.
2847 2018-05-26 17:57:57 Go on stocks
2848 2018-05-26 17:56:10 Well if media wasn't there all stocks would trade at book value.  Media hype let's you sell stocks at 20-30 times book value (assuming you were smart enough to buy at lower valuations)
2849 2018-05-26 17:53:39 Pick up a complimentary baggy t-shirt* from your local supermarket with every purchase of some gammon and a Daily Mail.

*while stocks last
2850 2018-05-26 17:53:33 Why would anyone attack @sgyemikale ? He’s literally the only trustworthy voice in this admin.

Look, the best time to buy property, stocks, etc is at the bottom/aftermath of a recession/bubble when everything is priced as junk. That’s Investment 101, when cash is truly king.
2851 2018-05-26 17:52:41 Clearly I need to look into stocks ..
2852 2018-05-26 17:52:34 A trading truth: When you're right, you never have enough on. When you're wrong, your position is always too big.  #Daytrader #stocks #DayTrading #SwingTrading
2853 2018-05-26 17:51:14 so many high-beta tech stocks ready to take-off. GOOG, NVDA, AMZN all knocking on the door.
2854 2018-05-26 17:46:09 I know but if society must make "mens" and "womans" razors surely everywhere that stocks one must stock the other. Xx
2855 2018-05-26 17:44:42 Companies are spending their money on buying their own shares. the vast majority of the billions of dollars in planned share purchases will benefit the richest 10 percent of US households, who own 84% of all stocks. The top 1 percent of households own about 40% of all stocks.
2856 2018-05-26 17:42:18 Faut que je prenne le premier tweet de chacun de tes threads et je les stocks.
Ou mieux, @AnaVdlb c'est quoi le compte qui génère une compilation du thread j'ai oublié ?
2857 2018-05-26 17:42:11 GDP was the biggest Scandal...only reason you care about the GDP is bcus Fox told u to.. Nobody was at home like unemployment down, housing market is up, stocks are up, wages are up, gas prices are low, but this Darn GDP IS KILLING ME...

2863 2018-05-26 17:38:45 Y’all need to start investing in stocks instead of niggas smh
2864 2018-05-26 17:38:43 The long-term picks which are touted as multibaggers suffer from survivor bias. Of 100 stocks , maybe 5 become multibaggers , rest 95 sink
2865 2018-05-26 17:36:15 Give people ways to actually make money in the stock market, gain free stocks, with no fees. They still don't do it. 

2866 2018-05-26 17:36:14 Where do you SDI MetaKnights ladder combos? lol. Lost all of my stocks but 1 off of ladders off top/side except one. Was SDIing like mad but don’t think it was the right direction.
2867 2018-05-26 17:32:25 I can't wait until bump stocks are illegal so I don't have to listen to machine gun fire in my back yard
2868 2018-05-26 17:32:19 If stocks mirror reality how come the US is losing out on so many other parameters such as health, average earnings, political standing and investment and up-keep of infrastructure ?

2870 2018-05-26 17:29:27 Bit late. Doubled money twice. Took profits. Invested in stocks. Now buying other crypto currencies that have better functionality.
2871 2018-05-26 17:28:07 Best friend says: “Crypto is gonna go to zero! The coins and exchanges are being hacked. You should invest in bonds and stocks instead to maybe money. Crypto is a bubble and fake.

2873 2018-05-26 17:25:24 Kindness is underrated. Like, just this Wednesday i was nice enough to play each game in bracket with only 2 stocks to their 4, and i think they really appreciated it <3 It's not that hard!
2874 2018-05-26 17:25:23 Lance, I believe in gun ownership. Handguns, shotguns, hunting rifles (properly and safely secured) are fine. Assault rifles (including AR-15), high-capacity mags, and bump stocks are not fine.

2877 2018-05-26 17:23:25 Dems tell us that stockholders are doing well.

I guess those Dems want us to  buy stocks with  some of the money that Uncle Sam is letting us keep in our pockets.
2878 2018-05-26 17:21:41 People should save Toy R US so millionaires like you should enjoy the rewards? Sell stocks to the people instead of begging for money. Make them owners too!!

Don’t they realize that workers can buy stocks?

2883 2018-05-26 17:15:24 I can bump fire with my bare hands. Does that make my arms a machine gun? 

Bump stocks don't make rifles into mahinese guns. Just as putting a pistol on your shoulder doesn't make it a rifle.
2884 2018-05-26 17:15:17 Maybe manila has stocks of the tardis

2888 2018-05-26 17:12:18 Bump stocks?  like you can’t fire any semi automatic and make it do what a bump stock makes easier. All about the trigger squeeze. Are you sure you know a lot about weapons?

2893 2018-05-26 17:06:14 It actually is because now banks can lend more to businesses which hire more and create more tax dollars which are spent and benefit companies that will make more money and stocks will go higher.  It's my line of work so I think I may have some insight into this topic.
2894 2018-05-26 17:04:46 Laxalt has refused to change state regs to allow the FBI to conduct all gun sale background checks as voters approved in 2016. He has failed to respond to the Las Vegas shooting where 58 people died and over 500 were injured, including coming out to ban bump stocks. #VoteBlue

2904 2018-05-26 16:58:28 Back to the original topic: civilians should not possess assault rifles, high-capacity mags, or bump stocks. Find me a single report of their use in self-defense. I can provide many reports where they were used to kill innocent civilians.

2911 2018-05-26 16:54:49 My brokerage told me the trade needs to settle before they can transfer it from USD to CDN trading account.
In two business days, even without material news, the stock price can either go up or down, so that is the risk. I wouldn't recommend oil stocks after the rally.

2920 2018-05-26 16:49:04 Buying stocks is supposed to be based on people’s speculation of how stocks perform w/ public information. If you have info the general public doesn’t & act on it it’s illegal (see: Insider Trading). If you’re the one literally creating policy & market conditions it’s even worse.

2928 2018-05-26 16:40:29 I have that feeling with Yoshi sometimes too. You’ll play so well but just can’t seal the stocks. It’s a lot of pressure to play a mid tier in this game since the top tiers are so oppressive.
2929 2018-05-26 16:40:06 Hrmmmm. Kinda stylized.  "if you bought 100 of your portfolio on the day that the market top" and also in real terms.   Real story: if you bot stocks frequently past 50 yrs you're doing well

2951 2018-05-26 16:19:22 People keep talking about “common sense gun laws”. I’m still waiting for some. Ban bump stocks, ok. Restrict magazine capacity, check. No need for semi-auto, yep. So, single-shot muzzle-loading black powder rifles?

2955 2018-05-26 16:14:57 Is more likely greater gun control, registration, requirement t keep firearms locked up at home, ban on bump stocks etc.

My simple thesis. India, a 2T$ country has a 25% savings rate(500B).

Now hardly 20B comes into mkts.

We hv many crooks running​ biz & only 200/2000 stocks are worth checking. 

When 200B type money starts entering these 200 will be sky high!

It's a VERY long game.

2974 2018-05-26 15:53:03 Like I said, insisting just makes you look ignorant. A few months back, @GOP proposes legislating broadening background checks, banning bump stocks, and arming school personel. Dems shot it down. Can't make this shit up

Show me wht u’ve done over last few yrs with ur savings
2976 2018-05-26 15:52:52 That is not how it works. 401k's are managed by someone working for the employer, and they usually have a diverse portfolio of other stocks and bonds. It is not an investment in the company, and is not for employees to buy company stock.

But even if every state does that if somebody wants to kill with a gun they will find a gun. It’s more than just a gun issue

2992 2018-05-26 15:37:28 I agree. In Jan. 2016 I bought calls on oil and sold it between Nov.17 and Jan. 18.
Because of the losses by the rolling of oil futures, my gain was not 100% (like oil) but 25% in 2 years. Then I bought stocks in oil and sold it 2 weeks ago. Now, I will do it a third time. 
2993 2018-05-26 15:36:59 Not specifically relevant to this one. But anyway, still waiting for the promised banning of bump stocks if you want to extend it.
2994 2018-05-26 15:35:18 And has a P/E into the stratosphere. When stocks come back down to earth, Netflix and other tech companies will fall precipitously. But until there’s a correction people will bid these up to crazy levels. Anyone remember the late 1990s & early 2000s?  I guess not.

3042 2018-05-26 14:48:27 Don't you think it's because people find "value" in low quality stocks?, because the ones with high quality would look expensive comparatively?
3043 2018-05-26 14:47:10 Yes it has, because of Obama and the tax breaks.  Corps are buying back their stocks. The tax breaks were to help him to line his own pockets. As I implied Trump’s negative effect will be ralized by the president who follows him.

3069 2018-05-26 14:26:18 My day's fluctuate sooooo much. Most of my stocks are in oil. I was soooo hyped to get into Raytheon and that shit has been dropping since I got it smh. Micron is a good one to grab as well.
3070 2018-05-26 14:25:22 In what alternative universe do you live. Under Obama, recession ended, stocks rose from under 7,000 to almost 20,000, biggest bull run in history, unemployment from over 10% to almost 4%. Interest rates low, gas prices low, etc. Trump inherited recovering economy.
3071 2018-05-26 14:24:22 Well, if you just started to invest this year, then you’ve seen some volatility. But if you’ve been in longer term, you should be doing quite well. Stocks are up quite a bit since the end of 2015.
3072 2018-05-26 14:22:04 @lucillekuntz866 where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?
3073 2018-05-26 14:19:59 Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood Morning! Happy Saturday! I'm reducing junk & organizing today amongst other things. I will also make it to the #gym for leg day.  Saturday & Sunday are my current days off from running.  Monday is a holiday, so more time to review #stocks
3074 2018-05-26 14:19:38 Remember when I said fear Trump on stocks because he was just off H….
3075 2018-05-26 14:18:38 Yes it is! So prove it.... I can! On a dark Monday in 1987, stocks collapsed, losing close to a quarter of their value in one terrifying day of trading. This October marked the 30th anniversary of "Black Monday." REAGAN! Ya want BUSH? You want Mortgage and Real-Estate prices?
3076 2018-05-26 14:18:11 Don't play the penny stocks.
3077 2018-05-26 14:17:10 I have noticed that the billionaires are really happy with their windfall tax cut. Buying back stocks rewarding their millionaire investors with large dividends. Middle class underwater cost of living rising costs, rising inflation NO tax cut
3078 2018-05-26 14:15:27 limited lang ba yung designs for privé? i mean yes unli stocks pero for a limited time lang ba sya pwede bilhin. or wala bang sense yung tanong ko.
3079 2018-05-26 14:14:06 I’m thinking about appying for corporate job just to buy up stocks at discount price how schemy is that?
3080 2018-05-26 14:13:48 I must look at how many of my stocks are on AIM at the minute
3081 2018-05-26 14:09:57 How about we start with closing the loop holes, banning bump stocks and mandatory background checks on anyone buying a gun anywhere?? “No change in the law will stop mass shootings,” says the only country in the world where it happens on a regular basis.
3082 2018-05-26 14:08:04 ModiGovt@4 & markets : Over 300 stocks turned multibaggers, investor wealth rose Rs 62 lakh crore     
3083 2018-05-26 14:07:22 Students used to be allowed to bring them to school to make custom stocks and to have them reblued in shop class. Multiple guns in school multiple times, zero incidents. Seems strange now, but it’s why I know guns aren’t the issue.
3084 2018-05-26 14:05:18 di ko maassure yung stocks ha?  actually miski ako kinakabahan like baka pagpunta ko OOS pala 
3085 2018-05-26 14:04:59 You can buy bonds just like stocks if you have an online brokerage account (like TD Waterhouse), But bonds are more complex. Companies only have one stock that they issue (which represents ownership in the company) but bonds are like mini-loans - you're lending money...
3086 2018-05-26 14:01:45 Hey @SenatorLee_cmc maybe you shouldn’t have passed a 1.5 trillion tax cut for corporations!  Corporations that are only using the money to buy back stocks to make investors happy!
3087 2018-05-26 14:01:40 I know my mom loves me because she stocks Moo Melon in the fridge
3088 2018-05-26 14:00:52 It's really difficult to get this phone in Indonesia,,the flash sale not useful enough,,outside official online store the price is insane, they offer around 4 million..please fix the stocks

3091 2018-05-26 13:54:48 One of the listed demerits on 205 inspection fail sheet is non-functioning plate lighting due to bad bulb holders most likely. Will not have time to get NOS ones from UK, and Peugeot no longer stocks them.

3093 2018-05-26 13:53:03 Trump has made our economy so good that people are profiting off of it (stocks) and so many people wonder why bitcoin is fighting to the death with other companies for profit off stocks and investments
3094 2018-05-26 13:49:13 As you mentioned also they gave the shops enough time to finish the stocks and find different brands 
This helps the national products to be more stronger

3101 2018-05-26 13:38:21 I do all my analysis when market is closed. That means before going to bed and on weekends. Once I have run all my screens and shortlisted few stocks, I place limit orders. I am usually placing sell orders as stop loss or after analysing the price behaviour at market close.
3102 2018-05-26 13:38:11 Gas prices have risen a few cents under Trump. And stocks? Are you sure you want to talk about those? Dow Jones was at 18,301 the day after the election. We’re at nearly 25,000 today. Please try again.
3103 2018-05-26 13:38:01 Andrew Left needs to be investigated by the SEC. How is this not illegal? So let me get this right, either you shorted the stock (for your own personal gain) or your evaluation of stocks is so piss poor that you really have no clue what you’re doing. Which one is it, Andy? #SEC

3109 2018-05-26 13:29:43 #CrookedDonald and his #CorruptAdministration are Laughing Stocks of the World. You said Iran Deal was "bad" before you had even seen it! NO KNOWLEDGE = Bad Leadership. P5+1 thought is was a good deal, now #DealBreakerInChief has made USA into a country that can't be trusted.
3110 2018-05-26 13:29:43 Billionaire leech Tom Steyer is running an ad to have the president impeached. He profited greatly when President Obama gutted the coal industry, buying coal related stocks while preaching to go "Green." His green buys swamp power; he needs its protection. Voters need to know.
3111 2018-05-26 13:29:37 Close the salmon season for a few years to let stocks build up. Catch and release only exhausts the fish and then it can’t reach spawning grounds anyway. And before the “Great Outdoorsmen” of NL get mad, think about the quality of fish you’ve caught in the past.
3112 2018-05-26 13:29:01 what is the title of person who stocks stores
3113 2018-05-26 13:28:42 Eccl 1:9: "There is nothing new under the sun"  Pump & dump has been around as long as speculative markets. I saw it in 1979 w/ penny stocks for start up gold/silver miners and in 1999/2000 with worthless web sites. Greed of novice specs is so predictable.

3115 2018-05-26 13:26:40 The mob wanted bump stocks to go.  Then it was assault rifles.  Neither were a factor at #SantaFe.  So now it is all guns.  Sorry.  20 wrongs shouldn't impact millions of responsible people.
3116 2018-05-26 13:26:35 2/2 allow universal red flag laws & and no guns for DV abusers, banning bump stocks & other accessories that make a gun automatic & ban military style assault weapons such as the AR-15
3117 2018-05-26 13:24:31 I think the reason is SM is trying to boost NCT's popularity before EXO starts going into military. When one powerhouse is on hiatus, the next will still be there to make the revenue. The same happened to EXO's seniors. It's a survival strategy so SM won't drop in stocks.
3118 2018-05-26 13:23:42 I support: Ban on semi automatics, bump stocks, all automatic weapons for general population. Correct and stringent background checks. Ceasing on line sales and sales from gun shows. Mandatory period before receiving gun. Gun exams that teaches correct handling. Age restrictions
3119 2018-05-26 13:21:28 Shaaaa @dialoglk stocks just went up by 300% I think... this is bigger than actually getting that update done!!! @shafjag
3120 2018-05-26 13:20:50 In these days it’s important to not let wins get to your head. Many start taking risks that go against the fundamentals they learned when first investing in penny stocks.

3125 2018-05-26 13:18:06 You want conservationists to applaud get rid of the grieg at sea aquaculture proposal. That would take some at sea mortality away from the wild salmon stocks.
3126 2018-05-26 13:17:02 You paid hefty fees to teach yourself!!!
No worries...
But the important thing is that don't repeat it again !!!

I know you lost either in FnO or in circuit stocks like #Vakrangee ...

Start investing in value stocks with market cycle i.e. during corrections in market...
3127 2018-05-26 13:13:04 Owning stocks is like having children -

3131 2018-05-26 13:05:26 Have you need been reading all the sources I link? Nations with these restrictions drastically reduce the number of mass shootings and homicides in their countries. Preventing every last death is impossible, but why defend your right to bump stocks if regs can save most lives?
3132 2018-05-26 13:04:22 And if anyone, anyone, knows about laughing stocks, it’s Trump. He, figuratively, wrote the book!

3143 2018-05-26 12:51:00 The low PE accorded to graphite stocks is due to the whole structural vs cyclical debate, yes? If the realisation that graphite is cyclical starts sinking can we see a rerating of both HRG & Graphite? Given that currently both trade at sub 10 PE of FY19E earnings.

3151 2018-05-26 12:38:40 This is soo BULL now! Oilprice goes down, so does ATI for some silly reason. My stocks will not be touched until the regs are final concluded.

3184 2018-05-26 11:59:32 As soon as we see the economy slows after the sugar rush of tax cuts feeds thru, the pressure will be on. Especially if the yield curve keeps flattening and if stocks struggle.  The #fomc by talking about a modest inflation overshoot is setting the scene for it to happen.

3188 2018-05-26 11:57:45 banks own real estate, loans, companies, stocks, bonds, currencies. With crypto market this young, they might want to join in - if the board allowes it and regulations are approving it, for investment purposes or to have quicker access without relying on market makers
3189 2018-05-26 11:56:04 Bunch of lalangs that think they are the know-all, be-all. I quote Gordon Gekko "Analysts don't know preferred stocks from livestocks!" although it was used in the context of the stock market, I feel it so appropriate here.

3193 2018-05-26 11:49:24 That's not a great sign if you believe in sentiment or contrary indicators. If everyone is bullish and already long stocks, who is left to buy?

3207 2018-05-26 11:35:15 Funny enough we were chatting about this in the Pub yesterday. My approach is to be Fundamentals driven first and I am as a default totally married to most of my Stocks. TA for timing Adds, Chops, Full Exit rarely etc. Hedge the bad markets.
3208 2018-05-26 11:35:13 If I followed the mob in stocks I'd never make a cracker , as an example.

Yet you see time and again in the media and elsewhere that certain people are 'out of step ' with what the majority think and therefore need to be brought into line.

Fuck me.
3209 2018-05-26 11:34:44 Premium to NAV is definitely a risk. However, what’s important is justified P/B. A very high ROE compared to discount rate makes market price stocks at multiples to BV.
As long ROE remains high and NPAs low high P/B is justified.
3210 2018-05-26 11:33:42 Me just checked my cupboard and food stocks are a bit low. Daddy’s beer seems to be in there, too. Apparently we have more than enough food for a week and we are near shops that sell my food. Hmmm, need to be sure! Mumski muttered something about me having a biscuit fest! Rude!

3229 2018-05-26 11:09:01 Are all second amendment supporters NRA members?  No, there are those that disagree with some aspects of the NRA such as their stance on bump stocks and their historical support of the Gun Owners Protection Act even though it had the Hughes Amendment in it.

3231 2018-05-26 11:08:20 Unions have been out dated. This isnt 1915 anymore. We have thousands of Laws protecting Employees now, The Internet to create immediate boycotts of products/services and web sites to publicly dump stocks of companies/corps who are being stupid.

3236 2018-05-26 10:56:10 I completely agree with you. There should be no Intraday or BTST allowed in non-index stocks. Intraday or BTST doesn't achieve anything except burn capital of retail investors.

3248 2018-05-26 10:31:36 Traders are bracing for a spike in volatility. The markets will be headline-driven through the OPEC meeting in June. I'm bullish on oil over 2018, but the next few weeks will be choppy. Trade stocks that track the oil price (e.g. LONE & TLW)

rather than looking for beaten down stocks ,i will be looking for stocks that are near the 52 week high as they can carry momentum

3299 2018-05-26 09:10:26 Agreed. He could have had several legally, but instead he had 14 AR-15s with bump stocks. I.e., it was meant to be something other than what it became once security showed up on the monitor. But maybe he(/they) had one or two full-autos up there.

3373 2018-05-26 07:27:43 Agreed for stocks, no utility but crypto can’t be a currency either until you bring down the volatility. I don’t feel comfortable using them as a means of storing value or for commerce, the volatility kills the whole concept

3388 2018-05-26 07:07:37 I’d argue stocks, unless they provide dividends, are worthless. What value does one get from stocks? It has no utility, it can’t be used to pay for things, it’s not scarce and doesn’t have any tangible use cases.

3458 2018-05-26 05:40:09 pano ba yan, wala na daw stocks ng uniform 
3459 2018-05-26 05:31:56 Oh and btw, for me personally, small gains just don't justify the mental stress and huge responsibility. Also, if I really focus on hitting home runs, I am way more picky about the stocks I trade and the setups, I'm more disciplined managing my risk, I don't overtrade etc.
3460 2018-05-26 05:29:18 Your triggered, hateful, attitude doesn't help your argument. 

100 round drum magazines and bump stocks are not reasonable accessories for law abiding citizens.

I say ban it when an epidemic is deadly...not allow it to continue.
3461 2018-05-26 05:28:25 Also most of the time investors/advisors ignore the portfolio construction methodology-is it just a bunch of stocks or is there a@method to it will determine what happens to your portfolio!! Unfortunately when market is going up everyone ignores the basics
3462 2018-05-26 05:26:05 Still, Stocks is a pretty good source, what about Quigly any info on her after she came outta the came?
3463 2018-05-26 05:26:02 None of the above as of now, will wait for the underlying trend in these stocks to get stronger than I might enter, do not mind to enter  at higher prices but will go by  the rules of technical analysis

3470 2018-05-26 05:15:14 Keep buying stocks
3471 2018-05-26 05:14:54 I just don't see the case to be short treasuries at all... yield goes too high and everyone bails on stocks and grabs a sure thing in treasuries..
3472 2018-05-26 05:14:16 Not every mid-small cap stock suffered!! Quality of stock and hence resistance to selling it was critical!! There are mid/small cap stocks that have actually gone up

That's just one off the top of my head.

3480 2018-05-26 05:05:33 The Stock Market is closed for the week, and now finally both of my stocks are in good position:  CORT at 18.70 and INFY at 18.32 and with some luck they will carry still higher.  #DwStocks2018

3495 2018-05-26 04:52:27 So different and better than his predecessor.  Obama downgraded our military might.  He made us laughing stocks to the point nobody feared us.

3513 2018-05-26 04:39:05 I can't explain it entirely in 140 characters but:
- Background checks on gun shows where none currently exist
- limiting access to long guns so that extra training & licensing is required to ensure responsible gun ownership 
- no bump stocks
- mags should be shortened

3527 2018-05-26 04:26:18 Sir, I bough tata coffee, zee media, all cargo and liberty shoes after you bought/advised them. All are in huge losses, please advise what to do with them. Recovery may take 2 years. If I need to swap them with some other  stocks, pls let me know.
3528 2018-05-26 04:24:29 Talk about laughing stocks....
3529 2018-05-26 04:22:45 Blame whoever approved the use of Bump Stocks .... That would be Obama - I know, right!
3530 2018-05-26 04:21:11 Bump Stocks were approved by Obama and the Democrats. Hypocrites!
3531 2018-05-26 04:21:07 So you stand against challenges to 2nd Amendment rights that are questionable, i.e. background checks for ALL gun sales, assault rifles, bump-stocks, etc

3536 2018-05-26 04:12:30 I want everyone to be liquid, so let’s make money trading options over next 2-3 months and then in September October when we crash were sitting in lots of cash so we can buy homes, companies stocks for 50 cents on the dollar.
3537 2018-05-26 04:08:45 Stock market update Check out the stocks that surged over 11% on Friday.
3538 2018-05-26 04:08:30 Let's talk stocks
3539 2018-05-26 04:08:07 about buying part, if I buy 2 stocks, one goes up I sell & book immediate profit, other goes down i buy more. now talking about momentum, I might have sold 1st one too early, & I may be stuck in averaging trap in the second. Its about how much you can wait before next buy on dip
3540 2018-05-26 04:07:58 Thirty years active duty and never saw one rifle as lame as an AR-15 for fighting ... never any bump stocks either.
3541 2018-05-26 04:07:17 The criminal mastermind Martha Stewart was locked up for lying about selling stocks! The Hildabest is still running loose!
3542 2018-05-26 04:06:36 One of the things I really hope for smash 5 is that it’s fast paced enough for 3-4 stocks. Smash 4 is soul crushing when an SD happens since it’s like SDing twice in melee. Not to mention any “jank” stuff that may happen wouldn’t have as much of an effect.

3545 2018-05-26 04:04:25 to some extent its where the brain pays attention. if we sell 10 stocks, 5 go up, 5 go down, then we only start tracking & remebering the stocks which go up & up. Its called selective attention

3560 2018-05-26 03:42:54 I hope that these liberals realize that them calling AR-15’s military style weapons means nothing. Even in our military, soldiers don’t shoot their M16’s in fully automatic. It’s inaccurate, and a waste of bullets. Same thing goes with bump stocks.
3561 2018-05-26 03:41:58 The legal age to buy a gun has been raised to 21 & a 3 day waiting period also passed and was signed into law in Florida in the month of March. Bump stocks were banned.

3564 2018-05-26 03:36:20 I think that's a bit unfair. It's no longer possible to get historic returns from regular stocks & bonds, since the decades-long push into 401ks has squeezed those lemons dry, so now the very rich go to these exotic investments that require more knowledge & motivation to monitor.

While I have written on few stocks here under #Credencestalktalk, I thought of checking with all of you to understand which medium do you prefer for stock related discussions.
Will plan way forward accordingly. 
Kindly vote & #Retweet for a larger voting base
Thanks!

3577 2018-05-26 03:21:26 From what I understand it’s basically like buying stocks. The value changes according to complex forces so the value of the currency changes as well.
3578 2018-05-26 03:21:25 Honestly it depends how much you have to start with. Less than 500 choose 1 or 2 stocks. Less than 1000 choose 3 stock. Don’t go more than 5 when starting out. The ones I buy myself I limit myself to 3 different & don’t move them My 401k & profit sharing is a mix of many though.
3579 2018-05-26 03:21:06 Cause who's to say you aren't crazy? Or me? A good start is banning bump stocks and putting a limit on the number of guns. Cause unless you are in a Death Wish movie, having your own personal arsenal is just dangerous.
3580 2018-05-26 03:20:39 Omg they trade marijuana stocks 
3581 2018-05-26 03:20:18 You don't know how stocks work.
3582 2018-05-26 03:18:45 Our IRA stocks have gone up, but could go back down like at end of last Republican admin. Walmart &  other workers deserve a decent living. Republican policies benefit the rich, crumbs for middle/working class, & contempt for working poor,  is why middle class is losing ground.
3583 2018-05-26 03:17:59 The best thing is stocks at your age. Pick ones that are steady in the market right now. I own stock in the company I work for because it is steady (Grainger) I also now have stock in Google and Apple. Through my 401k 85% is high risk stocks, 10% short term & 5% Mutual Funds.
3584 2018-05-26 03:16:44 Did they have bump stocks then? Who knew!

Finally figured out how to work my stocks I bought through my company, my profit sharing, & my 401k. Noe I am buying stock using Stockpile doing well so far. But it is all for my early retirement

3601 2018-05-26 02:56:46 Stocks derive their value from perceived cash flow & biz valuations

Commodities derive their base value from the cost to produce them

Currencies derive value based on central bank’s interventions (& manipulations)

What is the valuation matrix/benchmark for crypto ?

3608 2018-05-26 02:45:59 I suspect the real resource limitation won't be ships, tanks, or planes, but munitions. 

The US military has gotten used to fighting long, but low intensity, conflicts. If either scenario went on for more than a few weeks stocks of munitions would quickly run low.

3630 2018-05-26 02:16:35 ...the @GOP got taken over by #Russia, with @NRA's help coming from @Putin's buddy. Donald Trump's presidency was up for sale and at least 3 nations bought the stocks.

However, why killing intruders is almost always farmer's the first option???
3634 2018-05-26 02:12:34 @Ronin007 it’s a federal rule so no American company will let you do that with stocks. Either use a foreign co or use options.
3635 2018-05-26 02:12:19 I have a bump stock too. It's not as easy as it sounds to ban them because what are u banning? Even if u do ban bump stocks, then what? Confiscate them? Ya good luck. I'll be waiting. Also how many mass shootings happen with bump stocks?

3646 2018-05-26 02:03:28 I hope so too, but I saw tweets that the stock for shirts for today is supposedly for the whole day. So if that's the case its like those who have the 10am tickets can only purchase it knowing there's just limited stocks.

3648 2018-05-26 01:59:55 Yea that's what I'm saying. Ever since the end of 2017, the bond markets gone under 80, and it's been the source of volatility in the markets ever since. When the bonds would sell off, stocks would dip. Entities like the plunge protection team would come in n buy up bonds  to

3654 2018-05-26 01:52:45 That’s also 30 million reasons why bump stocks have still not been banned (though he said he would do at least that much, back in February) and why Congress continues to do nothing regarding gun laws.
3655 2018-05-26 01:52:39 Is that why gas prices are through the roof and stocks going down??? Yeah great job! NOT!

But not to worry, the She-Hulk writer got put on another book. So she can crater that one too.
3675 2018-05-26 01:30:34 i have no idea... i’d say it’s probably poor planning given their track record hhh but i’d have thought they would at least have a fixed amount of stocks per time slot so the people with slots at the end of the day would have a fair chance..

3682 2018-05-26 01:27:00 how could they finish the entire day’s stocks of shirts...within the first time slot
3683 2018-05-26 01:26:38 But that graph is skewed because gun companies' stocks have been increases for years while mass shooting have really haven't taken off except for in the last 20 years or so.
3684 2018-05-26 01:25:39 all stocks for tshirt are done for the whole day. Only 10 am slot can get tshirts and even then i couldn’t due to the amount of people buying. I just have so many questions right now

3686 2018-05-26 01:23:51 why are the stocks for the shirts so limited? did plds really think it would be one shirt per fan???

3691 2018-05-26 01:21:20 I said last year to get your 401 out of stocks because Trump and the GOP have repeated the steps that led to the 2008 Great Recession and this time it will be worse. 1) Tax Cuts for the rich, 2) Trillion Dollar Deficits, 3) Increased Military Spending, 4) Deregulation of Banks.

3693 2018-05-26 01:18:58 When Trumps voters hear tax cuts, they automatically think it’s for them. Little do they know. Companies won’t pass their windfalls to their employees...why should they? They will buy back stocks, and give their execs big raises....as if they deserved it.

3696 2018-05-26 01:16:39 So @davidhogg111 is attacking hard working men and women! Publix is partially owned by its employees in which they used these private stocks to save for retirement as well as their children’s college education.  @VictoryInLove
3697 2018-05-26 01:16:28 No they aren't. Nobody has suggested any gun ban. You're upset about something that's not even real. The suggested ban is on assault rifles, bump stocks, with age limits and background checks. Nobody with any authority or audience wants a ban on guns.

Sa panahon ngayon hindi na maganda ang bumili ng share of stocks, 
kung may pera man kayo huwag na huwag kayong bibili ng stocks.

3707 2018-05-26 01:04:49 Do you take positions in stocks ever just going off the chart? Or do you always have to at least understand the company’s fundamentals to make a proper trade? I know the fundamentals don’t matter, but when creating watchlists, do you always go through a company’s SEC Filings?
3708 2018-05-26 01:03:24 When stocks are falling companies want to invest in hopes of increasing shareholder price with the intentions of raising profit margins. If successful they then have the capital to expand and therefore hire more employees and open new stores.

3714 2018-05-26 00:55:03 I'm thinking about checking this monkey thing out,  they seem to like the same stocks I do.
3715 2018-05-26 00:54:21 Same here bro 
3716 2018-05-26 00:53:00 And the dumbest part of that view is that gold isn't even close to retaining its purchasing power at these levels. If it was, gold mining stocks would not be at 25 year lows.
3717 2018-05-26 00:52:16 Man talking to sumbody who has no idea about what they talkin bout is like talkin to a fifth grader about stocks...
3718 2018-05-26 00:48:56 Ban AR15s, bump stocks and magazines over 8 bullets. Raise national gun purchase age to 21. Background checks for gun shows and private sales. Criminal charges for people who don’t securly store their weapons would be a really good start.
Even if it may not solve all gun violence
3719 2018-05-26 00:48:08 Idiot, the laughing stocks on you.
3720 2018-05-26 00:47:27 The closed the shop and bought back $700m in stocks, so it doesn't seem to me that they are doing that bad. My brother sells Harley's in Vegas and he's busy as hell, so again I don't think there doing that bad at all. Just a dick move made easier with the BS tax cuts.
3721 2018-05-26 00:46:16 Start shorting stocks again!! Short specially the ones from the vultures...
3722 2018-05-26 00:46:11 You're a monsta in here lol
3723 2018-05-26 00:44:46 The discipline in trading is when it happens you have to do what is needed to be done, not before, not after, but at the right moment. Now the moment has not come yet! Hanging on to your positions! The market bias to these POT stocks is bullish right now!
3724 2018-05-26 00:44:09 No. NOW we are the laughing stocks of the world. Before you, we were the leaders of the free world. Now we are the used car salesman of the world that no one trusts. Hurry up and go to jail.
3725 2018-05-26 00:43:36 So we can expect to see your bill banning assault weapons, bump stocks, and background checks, say, tomorrow?
3726 2018-05-26 00:43:32 Publix is privately owned stocks, which my husband and I that are retired live off of. We are NRA members and are on the Trump train. Very woke. Boycotting would kill us and other employees.
3727 2018-05-26 00:43:31 The fact of the matter is that the 2A crowd refuses ANY type of gun reform. Not banning bump-stocks, not mandatory background checks nationally on ALL sales, not even raising the age limit.  And the excuse-du-jour of the is "it won't stop gun violence".
3728 2018-05-26 00:42:52 Yes - and the killing of our children at school needs to stop. First action - Ban Bump Stocks.

3741 2018-05-26 00:28:17 All I ask, and it a simple thing, is that Trump’s cabinet pay back the cost of their ill will towards humanity, and while they are in stocks , explain WTF they were thinking, being toxic to the earth, and spoiling our future for their grandspawn.

Read the articles about how people can’t afford the basic needs as previous generations could.  Trumps tariffs have caused the stocks to go down, and what about gas prices?

3775 2018-05-27 23:49:12 I think it is just wrong to sell at item like bump stocks which are made for one thing. Killing, not protecting yourself or your family.
3776 2018-05-27 23:48:20 I agree with that. TBH I think battery metals are not the only commodities that will boom from here. Most, if not all, commodities look beaten down and so many mine assets in C&M. Global stocks of critical resources have not kept up with demand. I see mining as the best buy now

3810 2018-05-27 23:40:47 Happy to comment to help. Bump stocks should be banned, there is no good reason why any civilian should have one.
3811 2018-05-27 23:40:43 3 street stocks showed up to race last night. guess that $300 entry fee with no points fund was a smart idea still? ya.......ok! for reference there was 14 of us 3 years ago, with 32 showing up for our big weekend in August. let that sink in
3812 2018-05-27 23:39:29 Who’s to say that bump stocks are not for self defense??
3813 2018-05-27 23:39:13 Because the age is stupid, why change it? Bump stocks are crap do who cares ban or not there not practical.
3814 2018-05-27 23:37:29 Steak, macaroni salad, rice and beans. Life is so good. Job on the sideline for the summer along with investing with the stocks. Life is fucking lit.
3815 2018-05-27 23:37:02 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would?

3822 2018-05-27 23:31:29 Ok. Bump stocks have never been officially used nor confirmed in any mass shooting. They're a gimmick that the two manf's knew would sell and wastes tons of ammo, also approved by the ATF.
3823 2018-05-27 23:31:21 Ban bump stocks.
3824 2018-05-27 23:31:01 FYI you can't legally buy stocks if you don't have at least a million dollars

3827 2018-05-27 23:29:22 thanks, yup, some of the people who have made six or even seven-figures off my strategy are just ingrates and they don't like me calling them out on it, but it's true...they knew NOTHING about penny stocks or short selling before me, I don't ask for much just a little thanks :)
3828 2018-05-27 23:28:59 Bump stocks are not a 2nd amendment right. They r designed to slaughter many people in a short amount of time. That is for war. #BanBumpStocks
3829 2018-05-27 23:28:36 He just did. Ban bump stocks and raise the age to 21. Now your turn. That's how this works.
3830 2018-05-27 23:28:14 Invested $940 this week in stocks and shoes. With the week ending I’ve made a little over 13% ($124) let’s keep it going next week! #LPP
3831 2018-05-27 23:27:45 It's fair to say that they're both widely loved, have years of growth ahead, and their stocks are near all-time highs.
3832 2018-05-27 23:27:38 Ban bump stocks!
3833 2018-05-27 23:27:25 #Tahtwhatisfunny  Trump  getting   paranoid  about  the russian investigation  is  very  laughable love  it  right  now.  And  repulicans   that stick  with  him   are  laughing  stocks  also.   Difference is  don jr  is  in  it  because he  met with  the  russsians.
3834 2018-05-27 23:26:03 Hey John Read the tweet he just gave 2 solutions raise min age and ban bump stocks! he did not say anything about #NRA
3835 2018-05-27 23:25:19 i honestly feel like the kanye west kim kardashian bubble is going to burst and it wont be pretty. both of their stocks will crash within the next 5 yrs. kanye's album will probably flop, the karadashians will get cancelled, and in 5 yrs these people wont be relevant anymore.

3840 2018-05-27 23:20:00 Trump is still pounding Dems in Tweets versus being a better leader to back Gun Control at least with increasing age limits and banning bump stocks despite the $16MILLION PAYCHECK NRA had given him  & $5Million byRussuan Oligarcd Arms Dealer 2016-17.

3852 2018-05-27 23:12:30 Thank you very much for coming to see us today. Apologies for running out our stock rice & edamame. Will bring out more stocks next month!
3853 2018-05-27 23:10:31 They had to sell the bump stocks on the shelves first. Duuuh....
3854 2018-05-27 23:09:42 Why did Obama let bump stocks happen to begin with?  Furthermore, why did Obama and the Democrats that controlled the House and Senate from 2009 to 2011 do nothing at all about gun control?  Not one, single thing.  Hmmmm
3855 2018-05-27 23:09:17 Trading is the sure fire way of becoming a NoCoiner.  Yet so few understand that. I try to tell people everyday. Sad to learn the hard way. I got that expensive education in stocks.  Yet Bitcoin is Still cheap even now. Buy Bitcoin.
3856 2018-05-27 23:09:15 The health of the stock market is only indicative of the rich doing well, as most stocks are owned by the top 10% of earners. You ain’t shit
3857 2018-05-27 23:09:05 The massive packaging and therefore unnecessary use of plastic resulting in microbits is the harm for our fish stocks.
3858 2018-05-27 23:08:53 Not the same analogy... 
Bump stocks aren't for self-defense
3859 2018-05-27 23:08:32 I'm bearish on Russian hacker stocks!
3860 2018-05-27 23:07:44 Hey asshat; it’s been over 3 months. Where’s the national ban on bump stocks? Or were you too busy speaking at NRA conventions, getting their Russian money and humping their leg?
3861 2018-05-27 23:06:35 Did you find anywhere that stocks this case in the UK? Everything I can find is a long wait for delivery from China :-(
3862 2018-05-27 23:06:21 Also at this tea shop, a dude is on FaceTime and explaining to his mom that his Tesla stocks are tanking but his marijuana stocks are soaring. Guys, I need to get out more. I forgot how fun eavesdropping is.
3863 2018-05-27 23:06:02 Maybe trump will sell us some of his stocks in the Chinese phone company with all the new jobs. 
3864 2018-05-27 23:05:04 BTW, I’m on the mailing list of the biggest maker of bump stocks, Slide Fire, and they took it upon themselves to close their business as of May 20. “Bump Stock” problem solved. With a ban, you may get some law abiding people to surrender theirs but not the criminals.
3865 2018-05-27 23:04:08 Ban Bump Stocks
3866 2018-05-27 23:03:45 Ban bump stocks now!
3867 2018-05-27 23:03:42 Well ya know it was under Obama that bump stocks were ok'd to sell commercially to private citizens?!? Trump is trying to get them banned thru the proper channels. So all this is only a publicity stunt by person or persons trying to become more famous.
3868 2018-05-27 23:02:43 Ban bump stocks now!
3869 2018-05-27 23:00:52 Forcing to end bump stocks sales?  i guess that means I need to get my trigger finger registered. #CrybabyLeft #2A
3870 2018-05-27 22:59:41 Guns must go. Bump stocks must go. The war on kids must go!
3871 2018-05-27 22:58:49 Ban bump stocks!!!!!  This is a pretty clear choice!!!
3872 2018-05-27 22:58:26 What is that number? He was shooting from an elevated position into a closed pen with 22,000 people in it, the proverbial fish in a barrel. 

Bump stocks are dopey. They waste ammo. They reduce accuracy. But they do not and have not caused lots of people to die, ever.
3873 2018-05-27 22:58:04 Why did the Obama administration say bump stocks were ok?
3874 2018-05-27 22:57:26 Hey dummy, he did ban bump stocks.  Also, he told congress to put forth gun related legislation. Ask your democrats why they have done nothing
3875 2018-05-27 22:56:25 No bump stocks! That is what's at hand! Why do you need that?
3876 2018-05-27 22:55:51 FRIP 

TD, just bring back FRIP stolen from Scottrade clients. FYI,FRIP allowed investors to pool dividends and then allocate them to any five stocks/funds at any percentage, monthly at no cost. Balance holdings, built new positions. Awesome tool lost! Let TD know if you want it.
3877 2018-05-27 22:55:48 We should ban bump stocks. We don’t need them. 
3878 2018-05-27 22:55:07 They have already started to ban bump stocks. Do you even try to educate yourself
3879 2018-05-27 22:54:29 Hey John he just did, raise the age to 21 - that seems simple enough to save lives, and stop selling bump-stocks, which were as stupid to be sold as selling weapons of war. It would be easy to accomplish if it weren’t for the NRA paying republican representatives for their votes.
3880 2018-05-27 22:53:50 Ban bump stocks.
3881 2018-05-27 22:53:27 Ban bump stocks
3882 2018-05-27 22:53:24 You’re welcome so much about that. Madami akong stocks, gusto mo pa?
3883 2018-05-27 22:52:59 Ban the bump stocks!
3884 2018-05-27 22:52:47 @Potus never said he would raise the firearm age to 21 nor ban bump-stocks.  He doesn't write law - Congress Does and they have not given him a bill to sign.
3885 2018-05-27 22:52:31 Where is Hogg criticism of Obama ATF for approving bump stocks in the first place, when they are an obvious class 3 item?
3886 2018-05-27 22:52:28 Bump stocks are criminal! BAN THEM!!!
3887 2018-05-27 22:52:20 Ban bump stocks!!
3888 2018-05-27 22:51:56 Perhaps because banning bump stocks and raising age limits won’t do squat to reduce gun crime. We don’t have a gun problem, we have a people problem. Stop relying on the govt to solve all your problems.
3889 2018-05-27 22:51:34 He was outstanding in Last Jedi. I will give you that.
3890 2018-05-27 22:50:48 Bang pressure cookers....they're made into bombs....bump stocks - with a few "around-the-house" items can also be made.... #education
3891 2018-05-27 22:50:36 Ban bump stocks.....unbelievable that they are still legal

3894 2018-05-27 22:49:30 Stand up to what ? For doing a good job ? Economy is great , unemployment lowest its been , nk denuclearizing , americans being freed from other countries, trade imbalances being fixed ,more jobs being created, taxes are lower ,space force created , stocks up whats the problem ?
3895 2018-05-27 22:48:58 Just scanned 1k stocks on this rain filled Sunday. Retail charts look healthy. I’m afraid to look at wifey’s Amex statement. I’m hoping/praying she hasn’t been doing her part to help the sector. PS congrats to @ScuderiaFerrari on ththe podium finish.
3896 2018-05-27 22:48:29 Ban bump stocks!!!
3897 2018-05-27 22:48:27 There is no place for bump stocks in civilian life and no place for assault rifles either.
3898 2018-05-27 22:48:03 Ban bump stocks! Our children’s lives depend on it!
3899 2018-05-27 22:47:46 Ban bump stocks now
3900 2018-05-27 22:47:32 @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @MaxineWaters Can anyone really call these Democrats the voices of reason? I think they are barking mad and laughing stocks for all to see.
3901 2018-05-27 22:47:25 Ban bump stocks!
3902 2018-05-27 22:47:23 You need to understand that it is physically impossible to ban bump stocks.
3903 2018-05-27 22:46:50 two stocks from my watch list have me curious HMNY & NVCN

HMNY more than the other. Why did these two stocks get the uptick rule? #uptickrule #secrule201
3904 2018-05-27 22:46:08 It isI love the music to Joan Hickson Marples.Just reminds me of English Villages and cottages with gardens full of lupins and stocks.

3906 2018-05-27 22:44:50 Luke is right above Han for me. His performance in TLJ moved him up ahead of Han
3907 2018-05-27 22:44:31 Ban the bump stocks
3908 2018-05-27 22:44:24 Illogical. If this is true why the expandion of the immigration industrial complex and big contracts with two of the companies that ran prison ind. complex and why are stocks rising because of investments in it
3909 2018-05-27 22:43:55 Ban bump stocks and more.
3910 2018-05-27 22:43:48 You need comments? Ban bump stocks! In fact, ban all gun sales. There are more than enough right now for all the ammosexuals to get their thrills.

3918 2018-05-27 22:42:18 this young woman had me recommend her books for starting investing in stocks and then she also bought like 3 motivational self help books and honestly i’m rooting for her
3919 2018-05-27 22:42:05 Cause it is not illegal to own gun parts, however using bump stocks in a working gun is a totally different story
3920 2018-05-27 22:42:01 Even if the age for buying guns was 30 you would still have kids stealing guns and doing these shootings.  It's not like some 15 year old high school kid went to a gun shop and bought an AR-15.  I do agree about banning bump stocks though.  That might help a lil, but it wont stop
3921 2018-05-27 22:41:17 Oh please, by raising the age limit and banning bump stocks does NOT take away your 2nd amendment rights.
3922 2018-05-27 22:40:37 Yes please ban bump stocks now! #BanBumpStocks

3926 2018-05-27 22:39:14 Brass knuckles are illegal, fully automatic guns are illegal, Bottle rockets are illegal in Cali... Does that stop anyone from getting them ? Nope, matter of fact the more you talk about "bump stocks" the more you'll sell! @davidhogg111

3932 2018-05-27 22:36:33 @davidhogg111 why don't you look into what president made bumb stocks available for the public the answer is Obama lol
3933 2018-05-27 22:36:32 took me a year to figure out penny stocks weren't for me and find what I am good at... I hope you find your way soon Stephen
3934 2018-05-27 22:36:32 No one needs assault rifles other than our active duty military and bump stocks are just simulated assault rifles. #banbumpstocks
3935 2018-05-27 22:35:04 Whos really made cash off marijuana stocks?
3936 2018-05-27 22:34:44 Dear Tracy, I think both you and David Hogg know that if the President showed leadership on the issue of gun regulation, we might have a bipartisan effort to change the purchase age to 21 and ban bump stocks. Be kind, and have a great day.
3937 2018-05-27 22:33:47 .... just put it into stocks and make more money god. 

Or ya know don’t SPEND IT ALL 

Always with the depressiony junk.
3938 2018-05-27 22:33:13 Obviously you don't know how the government runs, cause if you did you would know they work at a snails pace. I know he has put in to ban bump-stocks but to raise the age to 21 I doubt will happen. How  can you enlist at 18 but be banned from guns??
3939 2018-05-27 22:32:18 Ban Bump stocks, #BanBumpStocks
3940 2018-05-27 22:30:39 There is no need for bump stocks or assault rifles for private ownership. Keep up the good work, kids. Know that we are with you.
3941 2018-05-27 22:30:28 Background checks might have helped a hell of a lot parents keeping their guns locked up would help a lot outlawing bump stocks
3942 2018-05-27 22:30:12 It is Elon Musk's turn in the public stocks.

Though shall not question the woke narrative!
3943 2018-05-27 22:29:18 Ban bump stocks and the gun they’re attached to
3944 2018-05-27 22:28:50 Mi-goreng stocks have been tipped too go parabolic shortly
3945 2018-05-27 22:28:06 And who gets the money from the sold stocks? The people that have the stocks being bought.
3946 2018-05-27 22:28:05 Because neither of those things address the problems of mental health or stolen weapons. Bump-stocks are scurry!!!

3949 2018-05-27 22:25:10 Bump stocks and assault weapons do not need to be sold to the public.  They were banned once upon a time. Gun Legislation does not mean you will have 'your right to bear arms' taken from you.  My point of 'missile' was what do you need to feel safe for your constitutional right?
3950 2018-05-27 22:24:47 is it a good time to buy stocks?
3951 2018-05-27 22:23:41 Why did Obama and his ATF approve bump stocks? Have u ever asked that question? Y should an 19 yr old that served his/her country not b able to buy a gun?
3952 2018-05-27 22:23:03 Ban bump stocks

3961 2018-05-27 22:17:22 Why don’t you ask Obama why his ATF brought back bump-stocks after they were already banned?
3962 2018-05-27 22:17:10 Agreed. I can’t fathom why people would be opposed to such a bill. It’s like saying they can’t support a law banning assault weapons, bump stocks, etc bc it doesn’t include  guns of every type except water pistols. It’s like not good enuf. SMH
3963 2018-05-27 22:16:18 Bump stocks are not needed to defend yourself or your property.
I cannot think of a reason why they should be available.
3964 2018-05-27 22:16:08 Ban, baby, ban. Ban the damn bump stocks.
3965 2018-05-27 22:15:45 Bump stocks have no place in our society. It’s a clear workaround the full auto weapons limits in existing law. Ban bump stocks!
3966 2018-05-27 22:15:42 Focus more on the ones slowly climbing that nobody even mentions... those usually are your under the radar outperformers.. I dislike crowded stocks
3967 2018-05-27 22:15:28 Bam bump stocks

3969 2018-05-27 22:15:01 While it is true that 10% of Americans own 84% (in value) of aggregate stock value, this statement is somewhat misleading.    Fifty-four percent (54%) of Americans owns stocks directly or indirectly (through 401(k) and other retirement plans and accounts.)
3970 2018-05-27 22:15:01 Yes—-ban bump stocks. Enough!
3971 2018-05-27 22:14:16 Common sense  ban bump stocks
3972 2018-05-27 22:14:15 No more bump stocks!
3973 2018-05-27 22:13:00 To all of you braindead Trumpsters: On 28 Feb
Trump says he'll ban bump stocks through executive order! the DOJ thereafter filed a regulation that will prohibit the devices. The regulation would classify these devices as banned “machineguns” under current federal law.
3974 2018-05-27 22:11:11 Lying again. Same old lie.

Ban assault rifles, bump stocks and don't let crazy people have guns.
3975 2018-05-27 22:10:57 FYI - @NRA brand many pro-gun advocates are ok with banning bump stocks. This is not really a fight.
3976 2018-05-27 22:10:50 I’m in crypto because I traded stocks for a long time and found this to a be super volatile space with lots of potential in the future. Mainly trade Binance and mex. Up on initial investment otherwise wouldn’t be doing this lol
3977 2018-05-27 22:10:28 Well we know who doesn’t follow sports. Most of them own businesses and stocks. Smh this is the ish I’m talking. That’s why I never s show any of these dogs any mercy.
3978 2018-05-27 22:10:18 He said ban bump stocks— that’s a solution. Would stop every domestic terrorist’s fav gun the ar-15 from being turned into an automatic weapon.

3982 2018-05-27 22:08:20 Bump stocks turn weapons into weapons of mass destruction
3983 2018-05-27 22:07:48 "Chu poor ting! Tat makes me feel tired just from hearin' from all tat!" 

Dani winced at the sound of all the amounts of stocks and prices and not to mention the amount of tired nights and sleepless hours of sitting.
3984 2018-05-27 22:06:02 Threatens their Stocks? 
This is so funny, every time Hoggwash Threatens people their values go up. He is pointing out Good People that I like to support.
Hell I Re-Joined the NRA cause of Hoggwash.
3985 2018-05-27 22:03:37 Please bsn bump stocks
3986 2018-05-27 22:02:17 Ban  Bump Stocks!!!
3987 2018-05-27 22:01:57 How do you figure guns are the problem David? Yea he said he ban bump stocks, were is the bill from congress? When are you going to realize the democrats are blowing smoke up your a$$ & using you just like the other kids your age for political chaos. Just saying.
3988 2018-05-27 22:01:55 Banning assault type weapons isn’t gonna stop somebody who wants to get one from getting one. Bump stocks are unnecessary. And better background checks wouldn’t hurt either. As far as security in schools and voting, those are both done on a local level.
3989 2018-05-27 22:01:44 He just gave you the solution. BAN BUMP STOCKS! RAISE THE AGE LIMIT TO 21! I have a couple more. UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS! DIRTY NRA MONEY OUT OF POLITICS! Those are solutions.
3990 2018-05-27 22:01:24 I see you can't have a conversation without name calling.  
Your 'right to bear arms' shouldn't be bump stocks and assault weapons.  My point was how big and how powerful should the right to 'bear arms' be?  What's next in your constitutional right to bear arms-- missiles?
3991 2018-05-27 22:01:10 Has anyone seen stocks come back from the greys? $FLSR
3992 2018-05-27 22:01:07 And internal fightings between groups are aimed to shrink their heavy weaponry stocks, remember  president who said Idlib must be disarmed!
3993 2018-05-27 22:00:44 Unlike other stocks that might have things in play $coho has an acquisition already which will be finalized on the 31st.
3994 2018-05-27 22:00:41 *offre soumise à conditions, sous réserve des stocks disponibles.
3995 2018-05-27 22:00:15 Ban the damn bump stocks!
3996 2018-05-27 21:59:51 Bump stocks sure, they are an accessory, but he can’t modify laws to make them more or less restrictive, nor can he pass an EO to modify guns which are already regulated.  Accessories like bump stocks aren’t regulated, thus their status can be changed.
3997 2018-05-27 21:58:53 I'm not making the customers pay. Company B the foreigner producer is making the customer pay by stealing his wages because Company A pays those "costs" to the customers as wages whereas Company B just buys bonds in sticks in account in Caymans or worse buys back stocks.
3998 2018-05-27 21:57:51 Just want to say your doing an outstanding job and we should ban bump stocks WHEN YOUR PISSING PEOPLE OFF your doing something to the RIGHT! LMAO or was it something right! Either way WORKS FOR ME! #NRASUCKS #NeverAgain
3999 2018-05-27 21:57:16 Adopt common sense gun reform and bump stocks before more innocents are killed #NeverAgain
4000 2018-05-27 21:56:38 Ban bump stocks. It’s past time for this
4001 2018-05-27 21:55:06 SVU on USA: 'Stocks & Bondage' - Benson and Stabler investigate a successful woman's suspicious death and find themselves in the world of sadomasochism.
4002 2018-05-27 21:54:34 I thought your point was that there was nothing the president can do. He could literally ban bump stocks tomorrow, legally, without Congress doing a thing. The ATF regulates firearms and all it would take to ban bump stocks is a directive from Trump.
4003 2018-05-27 21:52:42 why haven't you done anything about bump-stocks and raise the age limit... Afraid of the @NRA ? Move on please.......
4004 2018-05-27 21:52:16 @davidhogg111 Keep going "Courage Strong" Hogg.  Do not give up!  Ban Bump Stocks.  We are fighting against of a lot law makers, that in my opinion are nobody's.  You are SOMEBODY!
4005 2018-05-27 21:52:01 It’s hilarious how fixated you are with bump stocks. Two years ago, I guarantee you 3/4’s of this country had no clue what they were. Now kids like Hogg act like SME’s when to comes to firearms. Cut the act bro.
4006 2018-05-27 21:51:58 bump stocks r fun.  but u cant get rid of them...  that statement is bogus...  i think u need to take a class for LE and see what u learn.  heres the first thing: if theres a demand, theres a supply...  money is money.  people will do anything for payment.
4007 2018-05-27 21:51:54 They are buying stocks back which means our 401ks have less options. Now Trump wants to pull back regulations that would open the door to the same practices that caused the 2008 crash.
Most people lost 50% of their 401k wealth as a result. Do we really want that again?
4008 2018-05-27 21:51:53 Keep up the great work. I hope we can make a difference.Ban bmp stocks!
4009 2018-05-27 21:51:25 conn has now banned bump stocks !!!!!
4010 2018-05-27 21:50:59 Right.  Bump stocks and assault weapons were once banned too.  My point was now they are not.  When is the next 'right to bear arms' going to legalize bigger weapons for Americans to own?
4011 2018-05-27 21:50:50 Roy,
How much of the GOP Kool-Aid did you drink? By withdrawing from the Iran Nuclear Deal your cronies have 'green lighted' the Iran government to start enriching nuclear stocks. Meaning instead of ten years down the road they can start NOW. Just step aside, Blue midterms. Vote.
4012 2018-05-27 21:50:39 Almost 500 in my 401k after only a couple of months. Feels kinda good to know I’m at least gonna have a little money for the future. And I have stocks maturing. If I can invest in visa at some point I might actually set...

Cyrvs needs to leave my soul
4013 2018-05-27 21:50:06 Bump stocks were created to kill more people in less time. They work and it's vile.
4014 2018-05-27 21:49:36 Ban assault weapons; ban bump stocks; universal background checks; raise the age to 21; decrease magazine capacity  anything to enforce gun safety
4015 2018-05-27 21:49:12 Soooooo Battlefront 2 beat the crap out of EA's stocks and now BF V is set to go much the same way, could we maybe hope for the death of EA? think of all the licenses that would set free on the market!? C&C any one? Dungeon Keeper?
4016 2018-05-27 21:48:34 Ban Bump Stocks and save our children's lives!
4017 2018-05-27 21:48:05 Ban bump stocks, ban guns I don’t know why someone in sane mind needs a gun? You can’t fight government with your stupid AR-15 even if that is why you want it.
4018 2018-05-27 21:47:59 Yes! Ban bump stocks
4019 2018-05-27 21:47:47 Lol.....sure it would. It would halt any future sales of bump stocks, and raise the age to purchase to 21. Both of which are a step in the right direction. There's a lot of steps to take on this uphill climb against a bully organization like the NRA, so any progress is good.
4020 2018-05-27 21:46:56 Educate yourself. Bump stocks make the weapon less accurate and less stable. Hence not having them would have been worse
4021 2018-05-27 21:45:13 David has a common sense solution.  Ban bump stocks and assault weapons and you’ve stopped 90% of mass killing. Background checks, raise purchase age to 21.  Every one who wants to buy any gun should show hunter safety card.
4022 2018-05-27 21:44:55 There is no reason for bump stocks except to kill as many people as possible in as short a period of time as possible, as we witnessed in Las Vegas last year. Oh, yes, there is one other reason for them - profits for the manufacturers. Ban bump stocks.
4023 2018-05-27 21:44:52 Please take the STEPS NEEDED to PROTECT OUR YOUTH, these bump stocks are a baby step to correct a HUGE PROBLEM BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION.  NEVER STOP FIGHTING!!!!
4024 2018-05-27 21:44:43 I'll give you Solutions it's not that hard do background checks get rid of bump stocks we don't need assault rifles on the street
4025 2018-05-27 21:43:54 Ban the bump stocks yesterday.
4026 2018-05-27 21:43:39 There is ABSOLUTELY ZERO REASON for bump stocks to be sold, ever!!!
4027 2018-05-27 21:43:26 Dreaming stocks.
4028 2018-05-27 21:42:55 What am I doing for my birthday you ask? Just learning about stock splits and preferred stocks vs common stocks. It’s so fascinating
4029 2018-05-27 21:42:44 I used to live in Malta. Malta has no mass shootings. They banned bump stocks. Americans can't allow this to continue, our people are dying.
4030 2018-05-27 21:42:36 Nobody wants to take away guns . We just want some sensible #GunReformNow and to ban bump stocks that the killer in Las Vegas used .Universal background checks and to
#BanAssaultWeapons
4031 2018-05-27 21:42:31 Ban bump stocks!
4032 2018-05-27 21:42:30 No more bump stocks!
4033 2018-05-27 21:42:16 David your tweet is a little off topic but i will answer you. Bump stocks had nothing to do with any school shooting but that doesn't matter only law breakers shoot up schools only good guys with guns will stop them Its against the constitution to raise age to 21 guns are a right
4034 2018-05-27 21:42:14 Ban bump stocks!
4035 2018-05-27 21:41:46 We can start by banning assault type weapons. Getting rid of bump stocks, better back ground checks, security at our schools and voting out those who do not value our children’s lives as much as they value a gun.
4036 2018-05-27 21:41:20 I think as the paper representing our city, and official Liverpool FC cheerleader the Echo needs to take this a step further and call for an immediate replay of the game, and again and again until LFC win, and then Ramos can be put in stocks in Liverpool City Centre.
4037 2018-05-27 21:41:14 I got a large Haribo selection for my 40th and stocks are seriously dwindling. Bad times.
4038 2018-05-27 21:40:30 I totally agree Dennis.  sold DIS shares. It's a shame ; love the company and such great content. Just makes no sense. will buy again on pull back.
The Biotech Stocks are also getting hit ( Like AGN ) 4 no other reason reason but Politics
4039 2018-05-27 21:39:35 Banning bump stocks is one of several practical, common sense gun control actions that should be taken to assist in the control of gun violence in America.
4040 2018-05-27 21:39:23 Ban bump stocks!  Thank you, David.
4041 2018-05-27 21:38:27 I rather my son learn to write computer code or learn stocks early or some tech shit rather than being good at sports
4042 2018-05-27 21:38:12 Bump stocks enable people to skirt the law prohibiting the sale of fully automatic weapons. They should be outlawed and the manufacturers held financially liabel for any harm their use causes to person's or property.
4043 2018-05-27 21:37:56 Ban bump stocks now!
4044 2018-05-27 21:37:10 I think securities are necessarily more centralized than currencies because they operate over a partial part of the economy (stocks: companies, bonds: debtors), for this reason it seems like the value prop is not as significant as with currency, not valueless though imo.
4045 2018-05-27 21:36:44 Bump stocks are small part of the problem.  This is why the USA will never change.  Lack of focus.
4046 2018-05-27 21:35:46 Halfway thru the event, I auto’d everything and use a bunch of LP from the stock and is still left with 120 sth LP stocks now.
4047 2018-05-27 21:35:37 Banning bump stocks won’t do anything. Pistols are the most common weapon used in shootings and they’re restricted to 21+ under the Youth Handgun Safety Act.
4048 2018-05-27 21:35:14 Let’s also recall that these bump stocks were banned until they were allowed under the previous president.
4049 2018-05-27 21:35:11 So remind me on who got the credit for the tax cuts, where did trump care come from? Y’all want to give trump credit when he passes something but when it’s against your beliefs “that’s not how the government works” Trump could sign an executive order banning bump stocks.
4050 2018-05-27 21:34:31 Ok, ban bump stocks
4051 2018-05-27 21:33:58    I can't stop LMAO at this " Straw Man " BS !!!!!      Let them have bump stocks ; no self respecting shooter uses them anyway LOL !!!   I know .... we'll trade them for Maxine Water's " James Brown " wig !!!!
4052 2018-05-27 21:33:53 Not sure what all this has to do with Vic sect stocks down 44%.  But you can always find feel get lucky good stock market stories.
4053 2018-05-27 21:33:34 Well this is neat, you're both wrong

The Justice Department enforces laws and is indeed a part of the Executive branch. And no, technically the president cannot "make laws."

He can, however, draft Executive Orders, enforced by Justice - like banning bump stocks.
4054 2018-05-27 21:32:41 Ban bump stocks NOW!!!!
4055 2018-05-27 21:32:02 Ban bump stocks NOW!!
4056 2018-05-27 21:31:52 When TWA was "merging" with America the "experts said stocks would split after the merger.  I bought 500 shares.  
After the merger American sidelines TWA shares and stock went to 14 cents a share in a week.  TWA employee pensions where heavy in stocks too. They lost big time
4057 2018-05-27 21:31:47 Y sería un buen dato saber el número de camisetas que se venden con su dorsal. Seguro que rompe stocks semana tras semana 
4058 2018-05-27 21:31:20 Ban bump stocks and keep all Americans safe- especially our precious schoolchildren and teachers.
4059 2018-05-27 21:31:17 Ban bump stocks! Now!
4060 2018-05-27 21:31:11 I watch stocks for my wealthy comrades and use stock ( NVR ) as a economy guide flag 99% of the time NVR memic the U.S. Economy up & down then I place stocks on watch lists below it in order of best chances to return gains on shares / investments.
4061 2018-05-27 21:30:36 Actually they do oppose any semi that can be converted into a fully automatic. Believe me. I tweet with a lot of them. 

But many left & right would be satisfied to ban bump stocks or any apparatus that can effectively convert a semi to an auto.
4062 2018-05-27 21:30:23 Good luck with ur #Trading this week #Stocks #Crypto #Cryptocurrency #Commodities #Currencies
4063 2018-05-27 21:30:15 It IS easy, but not even necessary. Bump fire is a technique, and the attachment takes the skill out of it. Bump stocks also take the accuracy out of firing a rifle. If a shooter wants to kill, a bump stock is a handicap.
4064 2018-05-27 21:29:43 If hunters need bump stocks, perhaps they should take up fishing #BanBumpStocks
4065 2018-05-27 21:29:08 A solution like “ban bump stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21?” I literally just copied that directly from David’s post. If you haven’t heard the clear calls to action from David and other activists, you’re just not listening, and clearly you are not.
4066 2018-05-27 21:28:38 Solutions were offered by @davidhogg111 - ban bump stocks and raise age for purchasing firearms. Those a both actionable options. What solutions have you offered? #meetinthemiddle
4067 2018-05-27 21:27:39 Ban bump stocks.
4068 2018-05-27 21:27:37 Bump stocks should be banned
4069 2018-05-27 21:27:09 Please ban bump stocks and assault rifles. Absolutely no reason for any civilian to own one of these. The madness has to stop.
4070 2018-05-27 21:26:54 Looking forward to the destruction of #poliovirus stocks next. #Endpolio #WHA71 #WHA72?
4071 2018-05-27 21:26:18 He's offered several solutions: universal background checks, raising the purchasing age, magazine capacity.... In face, the comment you responded to even had a solution: ban bump stocks.
4072 2018-05-27 21:26:14 Ban bump stocks!
4073 2018-05-27 21:26:11 Start with the first solution in his tweet: Ban bump stocks.
4074 2018-05-27 21:25:53 Ban Bump Stocks!
4075 2018-05-27 21:25:09 Right, but he's done all he effectively can do with the bump stocks. It has to go through comment periods, and then review. Last I checked it was still in comment period.
4076 2018-05-27 21:25:02 How about banning bump stocks to start?
4077 2018-05-27 21:24:19 Ban bump stocks. But we must also look at part of the root of violence. Oppression is one. Vast differences between “the haves and the have nots”- severe differences. We are at a tipping point of societal ills. “Sad” that OUR govt allows it.
4078 2018-05-27 21:23:49 A cute sexy wealthy lady comrade of mines got stock ( HET ) at 7.00 dollars a share
Harrahs Entertainment then Hollywood Casinos purchased ( HET ) and she being smart sold it at 78.00 dollars a share there are all ways some up ward bound stocks if you don't mind checking reports
4079 2018-05-27 21:23:32 Its rough man, TOs of KY aren't huge fans and one of them even does similar things. I hate to john or whatever but i was up 3 stocks to 1 game FD and he kept telling things like "this dude isn't even good. Haven't had to play against shit like this in years..."
4080 2018-05-27 21:21:25 Wow. So these expected return targets in the 7s and 8s are based on traditional capital market assumptions? But the annualized REAL return of stocks, inflation adjusted, from 1966 to 2015, is 5.4%. I just assumed that for these plans to get to 7+ there was alpha baked in...
4081 2018-05-27 21:21:16 Not all of them are down & some Penny Stocks Analyst's predict will bring 269 % to 500 % gains 3 are ( MYDX )  ( KBLB ) ( BDCI )  once I watched a penny stock for my wealthy comrade when Wal Mart went in to Mexico ( WMMVY ) started in at .56 cents a share end up at 57.00 a share.
4082 2018-05-27 21:20:25 What kind of "sport" is it to hunt an animal with a bump stock on a gun? Admit you just want to kill as many people as possible. Ban bump stocks!
4083 2018-05-27 21:20:05 there is no 1 solution. I say piss everyone off. Do everything suggested, rid bump stocks, arm educators that want it, put up metal detectors, get armed police at schools,
4084 2018-05-27 21:19:54 Bump stocks are the poison arrows of our primitive society assuring death to those not in the NRA tribe
4085 2018-05-27 21:18:03 Ban bump stocks!

4092 2018-05-27 21:13:19 What would be more important is focusing on legislation that would actually address the problem. Bump stocks are almost never used in crimes, nor do they need to be for even a mass shooting to be effective. And because most firearms used in gun crimes are (1/2)
4093 2018-05-27 21:12:38 Taking away guns is not the same as banning bump stocks.   Huge exaggeration and bump stops to free speech is a reach
4094 2018-05-27 21:12:23 lets ban these bump stocks
4095 2018-05-27 21:12:18 The city of Denver passed a city ordinance banning bump stocks after the Vegas massacre that went into effect on January 31, 2018. Guess how many have been confiscated in 4 months? ZERO!! Bad people are always going to have weapons, stop being so naive. Your not helping the cause
4096 2018-05-27 21:11:47 Ban bump stocks you NRA scum
4097 2018-05-27 21:11:17 Stocks are down 44%
4098 2018-05-27 21:11:13 Bump stocks are nothing more than a loophole in the present law that prohibits machine guns.

4106 2018-05-27 21:07:21 The important take away is that bump stocks aren't the issue. People with issues are the issue.
4107 2018-05-27 21:06:41 Ban bump stocks
4108 2018-05-27 21:06:39 Ban bump stocks please!
4109 2018-05-27 21:06:03 Executive Order could have done this but he thought you would forget that he would support raising the age and bump-stocks.
4110 2018-05-27 21:05:53 Please ban bump stocks

4114 2018-05-27 21:04:37 he could sign one of his favourite things - an executive order - he said he would ban bump stocks - in days , he could at the very least TRY , IF he cared - but he doesnt
4115 2018-05-27 21:04:34 No, I don't need one, nor do I have one. Bump stocks are unnecessary. Now that we agree on one thing, let find another.

4121 2018-05-27 21:00:44 bump stocks? What would you need a bump stock for?
4122 2018-05-27 20:58:41 Please, ban bump stocks!
4123 2018-05-27 20:58:32 Because he saw the light and realized that isn't right. Please tell me how banning bump stocks, ARs, and raising the purchase age would have helped those in Santa Fe?
4124 2018-05-27 20:58:15 Weapons don't kill people, uninformed, erratic, and irrational people do. Raising the age and banking bump stocks will do nothing, a distraught teen can grab his father's weapon if not properly stored.
4125 2018-05-27 20:57:08 Ban bump stocks #BanBumpStocks
4126 2018-05-27 20:56:53 Why are bumps stocks an item that the American public needs?
4127 2018-05-27 20:56:09 I can prep meals for a week with $50 but that’s me. RT @PhillyTheBoss: You boys dont even have proper herbs,spices, stocks, etc in ya crib.. what u cookin at home for $50?
4128 2018-05-27 20:55:35 Ban bump stocks now!
4129 2018-05-27 20:55:17 Ban bump stocks !
4130 2018-05-27 20:55:03 What is it with you fuckin people and bump-stocks? I get that Paddock used them but they’re involved in such a minuscule amount of gun crime that the push against them just comes off as purely agenda driven. Which it is... Like everything you do...
4131 2018-05-27 20:55:03 @davidhogg111 bump stocks actually make rifles less effective, less accurate and even if they are banned it won't stop criminals from keeping them, getting them or making them if they want them bad enough.
4132 2018-05-27 20:54:05 Bump-stocks need to be BANNED!!
4133 2018-05-27 20:53:43 Do you know who legalized gun stocks?

4137 2018-05-27 20:53:21 Bump stocks should be banned everywhere, just common sense
4138 2018-05-27 20:53:18 Ban bump stocks!
4139 2018-05-27 20:53:11 Ban bump stocks. Now!
4140 2018-05-27 20:52:28 Well ... we should ban bump stocks. I support second amendment but their is no reason for civilians to have access to weapons intended for war.
4141 2018-05-27 20:52:11 The DOJ banned bump stocks after the BATFE punted under Obama.  It is under challenge in court on a legal basis.  BATFE forlls CFR rulemaking process or Congress must write a law.  Congress writes laws.  Agencies write rules.  The president cannot write law.  @davidhogg111
4142 2018-05-27 20:51:47 Ban bump stocks. Thank you.
4143 2018-05-27 20:51:46 Ban bump stocks.
4144 2018-05-27 20:51:29 Stop bump stocks now
4145 2018-05-27 20:51:21 Ban bump stocks now
4146 2018-05-27 20:51:00 Bump stocks? What a joke! You can bump fire a semi auto rifle with a shoelace or a rubber band. Google it. It’s very simple really. We have a people problem not a gun problem. We don’t need more laws
4147 2018-05-27 20:50:42 Why didn’t u Ban bump stocks as you said you would? And why do u lie everyday??
4148 2018-05-27 20:50:29 Why where bump stocks legalized in 2010? What asshole was responsible for that?
4149 2018-05-27 20:50:17 @h3h3productions can I bring my son on the show? He is a lot younger than me and has a bone to pick with you about stocks! Love the show and twitter
4150 2018-05-27 20:49:40 Let’s ban the bump stocks now #BanBumpStocks
4151 2018-05-27 20:48:47 The right doesn't care for your lives.  It's that time.  Bump stocks are not protected by the Constitution
4152 2018-05-27 20:48:27 The only reason to have legal bump stocks is to convert weapons into devices of slaughter. Ban them. Buy them back.
4153 2018-05-27 20:48:26 Probably..... Read up on crypto take your next check and 20 out of each after that invest into a coin(s) penny stock, stocks something , but opt out of working for whoever the rest of your life.....
4154 2018-05-27 20:47:54 Ban bump stocks. Now.
4155 2018-05-27 20:47:52 Good luck with your campaign to ban bump  stocks #BanBumpStockd
4156 2018-05-27 20:47:28 Definitely need to ban bump stocks.
4157 2018-05-27 20:47:18 #RT @davidhogg111: @realDonaldTrump Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would?
4158 2018-05-27 20:47:06 Absolutely no reason to avail bump stock for purchase. BAN BUMP STOCKS
4159 2018-05-27 20:46:56 I'd rather ban idiots who think that banning bump stocks would actually have a demonstrable effect on gun violence.
4160 2018-05-27 20:46:40 It's time to get the bump stocks.  A good first move.
4161 2018-05-27 20:45:58 Bump stocks are novelty item numerous other ways such as a rubber band
4162 2018-05-27 20:45:58 Ban bump stocks!!
4163 2018-05-27 20:45:51 Same reason Obama didn’t ban them.  In spite of the NRA finding bump stocks of no valid use other than rapidity of fire (at the cost of accuracy).  It was the Obama ATF that allowed their sale.  Retail outlets can set age limits.  Let’s address the real problem.  Bad people.
4164 2018-05-27 20:44:50 Ban bump stocks.  There are some things that are just not necessary for people to have.
4165 2018-05-27 20:44:42 Ban bump stocks.
4166 2018-05-27 20:43:31 Commenting to ban bump stocks. Do it!
4167 2018-05-27 20:42:32 No reason for bump stocks in the first place...
4168 2018-05-27 20:41:59 Comment here?  I have a comment all right.  Bump stocks?  Why does anyone need them?  Why?  You need to hunt with an automatic weapon?  You're not much of a hunter, then, are you?
4169 2018-05-27 20:41:59 Bump stocks should be banned.  They are a public health risk.
4170 2018-05-27 20:41:17 Bump stocks and assault rifles such as AR-15 need to be banned and universal background checks need to be required by law in the US so that there is significantly less gun violence.
4171 2018-05-27 20:41:11 Bump stocks aren't the problem. Democrats are.
4172 2018-05-27 20:40:28 The majority of Americans wish anybody but you were in charge. Like say Snoopy or Charlie Brown. I sleep well at night knowing history will be very unkind to your "presidency". Do as @davidhogg111 has asked and ban bump stocks and raise the purchase age.
4173 2018-05-27 20:40:19 Ban bump stocks and ban the terrorist NRA org!
4174 2018-05-27 20:40:13 Stocks
4175 2018-05-27 20:40:06 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would?
4176 2018-05-27 20:39:36 Ban the damn bump stocks
4177 2018-05-27 20:38:50 Ban bump stocks.

Only makes common sense!
4178 2018-05-27 20:38:40 That’s the most annoying thing about stocks you can all too easily rush from one stock to another just for the sake of investing, better to wait it out like you say. The next big thing is always around the corner. 
4179 2018-05-27 20:38:37 A vast majority of school shooting were done with AR-15's. The second part of our equation is more strict background checks. A mentally ill person shouldn't be allowed to own guns. This fight isn't just about banning bump stocks and high powered guns.
4180 2018-05-27 20:38:37 We can ban bump stocks!!
4181 2018-05-27 20:38:27 Bump Stocks are for losers not guns!
4182 2018-05-27 20:38:25 Please please please ban bump stocks.
4183 2018-05-27 20:38:14 Bump stocks are no longer sold, Dave. And moving the gun buying age to 21 is unconstitutional unless you move adulthood up to 21 as well.
4184 2018-05-27 20:38:05 #BanBumpStocks No brainer. Ban Bump Stocks. It is beyond stupidity that this hasn't been done already
4185 2018-05-27 20:37:28 We can ban bump stocks
4186 2018-05-27 20:37:15 No need for bump stocks in civilian life.
4187 2018-05-27 20:36:56 Just say #NO to bump stocks
4188 2018-05-27 20:36:30 I’m waiting for @realDonaldTrump to ban bump stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21!
4189 2018-05-27 20:36:25 I support the banning of bump stocks.
4190 2018-05-27 20:36:14 We should not only ban bump stocks but also all semi-auto guns. US should follow other civilized countries and adopt a full gun controls. BTW, I'm not seeing you guys in the news anymore @davidhogg111
4191 2018-05-27 20:36:07 (stocks up on smoothies and iced coffee)
4192 2018-05-27 20:35:48 You people try to DO before you UNDERSTAND. Bump stocks aren't a problem. You clearly don't know how they work or what they do if you think this is an area of concern. Laughable.
4193 2018-05-27 20:34:57 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would?
4194 2018-05-27 20:34:56 Maybe bring back stocks in the public square!

4197 2018-05-27 20:33:13 I have. I enjoyed the targeting aspect. Unless you are an Info Wars type conspiracy theorist, please verify that Vegas shooter did have bump stocks. I had never heard of them. I have never pointed a gun at an animal or a living target. I when through military recruitment process
4198 2018-05-27 20:30:39 Thank you
4199 2018-05-27 20:30:11 So Blondie, aka tRump, promised the students he'd do something about background checks & banning bump stocks, even going so far as to accuse Congressman on national TV of being afraid of the NRA, right at the very time he was selling out the students. Cowardice personified.

4205 2018-05-27 20:22:13 Are you saying that cutting off trigger fingers is the logical extension to the law I propose.  I know enough about guns, and gun safety, to know that I don’t mix well with them.  The reason that even Trump is supporting banning bump stocks, is because it enabled Vegas shooter
4206 2018-05-27 20:20:41 Increases and job creation. Is it socialism to offer more tax incentives for having more children? Every time they try this companies buyback more stocks and invest little into the company and employees. Inflation always goes up, interest rates go up and we end up in recession.

4210 2018-05-27 20:16:58 Bump Stocks are a murderer's tool. No one else needs them.

4214 2018-05-27 20:12:55 Ban bump stocks!
4215 2018-05-27 20:12:18 How's you stocks doing, poop head?
4216 2018-05-27 20:08:26 Definitely not a robbery. Thompson was running the whole fight. He wasn't active like he was against Madrigal. Both these guys' stocks go down imo. Boring ass fight
4217 2018-05-27 20:08:08 Not suggesting shorting it. Not after "experiencing" housing stocks in 2005-2006. Just an interesting aside that will make me watch them in the future.
4218 2018-05-27 20:07:57 Stocks will take a dive and did you see Netflix has as a movie or documentary called Explained with first episode with Cory weirdo Booker
4219 2018-05-27 20:06:42 Anger by proxy. Some need fuel for their fury, they don't know why, but yaxley stocks their coal bunkers, stokes their fires and sates their need to be relevant. It's all a bit sad really, they are like little lost boys denied their teddy bear.
4220 2018-05-27 20:03:16 Gun sales have been way up since 2009. So have gun stocks!

4223 2018-05-27 20:00:45 This is just straight up bullshit. The people that benefit from trade deals aren’t specific governments, but instead the wealthy people that own corporations or own large sums of stocks in corporations. That’s why the trade deals are created.

4244 2018-05-27 19:47:30 Trump doesn’t understand the economy. When he says the economy is doing good he means the stock market is up. Just because the stocks are up doesn’t mean the economy is good.
4245 2018-05-27 19:46:35 Good employees will leave. Customers will leave. Store will close. Stocks will plunge. You can NOT appease liberals.

4260 2018-05-27 19:33:19 Bump stocks are hardly ever used in mass murders involving guns. Vegas was the only one i know. What good would an assault weapons ban do? Then mass shooting would be done with semi auto pistols. So then what? Ban hand guns?
4261 2018-05-27 19:33:13 I think they bump stocks should be banned too, but they do not technically turn a gun into an automatic weapon. It displaces the trigger into the stock after the first trigger pull. The recoil of the gun triggers the next round. Keeping within the law of one pull, one bullet.
4262 2018-05-27 19:30:54 Ban bump stocks and vote!

4274 2018-05-27 19:24:35 Bump stocks were banned in MA & NJ, guess how many have been turned in?  Less than 10.  Now try doing that with firearms.  I remember a time where we under pressure to disarm...1776 happened.

4279 2018-05-27 19:17:03 It's to easy to be a kid in a candy store with #OTC #STOCKS that you could find yourself buying & chasing many. You don't want bags! Make a plan and stick with it, adjust as you go forward and #Trade smart. If you don't, others will realize the #wealth from your losses!
4280 2018-05-27 19:16:44 Stocks are cool too I guess
4281 2018-05-27 19:14:34 I vaguely recall seeing some general furore about Mike Stocks a few weeks ago. What a tool.
4282 2018-05-27 19:13:45 Ban bump stocks

4285 2018-05-27 19:12:11 The time between market peaks in an inflation-adjusted index does not measure losses unless one liquidated all stocks at the peak and never got back in. Not selling at the peak might be an "opportunity cost" but there no real loss unless you buy high and sell low.
4286 2018-05-27 19:10:45 Steve- I enjoy CNBC for financial news.  Keep it there buddy...please.  The Trump stuff is kinda like the free market....people will stop buying a crappy product.  No one really listens to Trumps words much anymore- oversaturated and hyperbole-let’s stick to stocks!
4287 2018-05-27 19:10:45 Should @fssaiindia not check the stocks of @bigbasket_com?
4288 2018-05-27 19:08:56 “Beats Working...” - superb tome, I bought my copy on the day it was published, thought it had been out of print for ages - apparently not! Have seen it on eBay/ Discogs for silly prices, so buy now from @PeopleForPrint while stocks last!
4289 2018-05-27 19:08:06 Well you the real MVP. My shit would be looking like freddy Krueger after week 1  I would probably take the million and invest it. 25% in stocks, 25% in assets like real estate, stash 40% of it for emergencies, and blow the other 10% with my people . #Wankingaintwinning
4290 2018-05-27 19:06:24 Ban bump stocks !

4295 2018-05-27 19:00:50 Sensible gun laws: universal background checks, mandatory wait periods for purchasing guns, safe storage laws, accountability and Liability Insurance for gun owners, ban bump stocks, Red Flag laws etc etc
4296 2018-05-27 18:59:32 Considering bump stocks were a novelty, not that many in circulation.  And considering the demographics of Denver, probably none in the city limits.

4298 2018-05-27 18:57:56 Ban bump stocks! Ban assault weapons!
4299 2018-05-27 18:57:41 No it's not ok for them to shoot anyone but why did the mass shooter carry out the act in the first place? I'm not disagreeing that gun laws need to be looked at. But those on the left wont stop at background check reform and banning bump stocks.

4301 2018-05-27 18:56:14 Quieren armar un cerco "anticorrida" para evitar otra turbulencia, dice Perfil.

Scratching my head, the risk to be wiped by profit taking while being short is big, especially if 65-66 handles are hit.
4307 2018-05-27 18:52:10 What about stocks down 50%, they would need to go up 100% to come to cost

4316 2018-05-27 18:42:08 There is no reason to allow the sale of bump stocks. All that does is allow a weapon to become even more destructive
4317 2018-05-27 18:41:32 I die another day when I see things like this. not one shop or supermarket where I live stocks anything dairy free like this. I go without so I'm just happy other people can have a happy cheese fest when I can't.

4330 2018-05-27 18:33:22 Hey David.  There is NO REASON why a civilian should have bump stocks!!
4331 2018-05-27 18:32:33 You are an investor. You may not invest with your money, but you invest energy and time in people. 

But just like with stocks, most people are ignorant of investing principles.
4332 2018-05-27 18:31:09 Bump stocks are: unnecessary, a

4341 2018-05-27 18:26:27 Let’s all get more bump stocks!
4342 2018-05-27 18:23:45 I would blame the assailant. Not sure where you're going with this. Most if not all school shootings haven't involved bump stocks.
4343 2018-05-27 18:23:04 Ban bump stocks
4344 2018-05-27 18:21:50 Ban bump stocks NOW
4345 2018-05-27 18:21:14 Oil down is good for stocks Listen to president Trumps tweets.
4346 2018-05-27 18:21:07 Um. The rise in oil was due to Saudi Arabia standing by its decision to cut production. It needed to prop up oil prices before it issued the IPO on its state run oil company. How do I know? I bet on Permian basin stocks and doubled my money in 3 months.

4348 2018-05-27 18:18:59 true.. but then why not just give Harper those mins this whole time? stocks must be super serious about players establishing/maintaining their roles from day 1.. even those glued to the bench lol 
4349 2018-05-27 18:17:40 Bump Stocks sales are probably soaring right now because of this 
4350 2018-05-27 18:17:32 So true. Add in (UK at least) no out of stocks (subs for greater value / branded lines at same price as oos item) free / low priced delivery, labour of pick, delivery, running costs, longest expiration dates, best quality. All in the name of progress.

4352 2018-05-27 18:15:36 I don't care how easy bump stocks are to make, they should be outlawed (and I'm glad Trump finally did).
4353 2018-05-27 18:15:26 At the least we can Ban Bump Stocks! There is so much we can do without stepping on the 2nd Amendment
4354 2018-05-27 18:15:01 Agreed.  Ban bump stocks.

4368 2018-05-27 18:06:21 I agree! We should absolutely ban bump stocks for two reasons:
1. It's meaningless.
2. They did so in New Jersey and literally no one turned in their bumpstock. The same would happen would any firm of firearm ban.
You and your followers deeply lack the ability to think critically
4369 2018-05-27 18:04:51 He has. And executive orders can only direct how current laws are enforced. The ATF has already said bump stocks don't violate any existing laws.
4370 2018-05-27 18:00:34 LOVE bump stocks, or I do now that you don't
4371 2018-05-27 17:58:44 Agreed. I would be happy if we just started with reinstating the assault weapons ban and getting rid of bump stocks and things like that that allow people to mass murder. I know we cannot stop gun deaths that we can limit them and who has access.
4372 2018-05-27 17:58:31 Hell of a comeback in this Storm-Sky game. Bird/Canada/Loyd/Stewart/Howard lineup giving Sky absolute fits with their defense down the stretch. Hughes schooling Stocks, who looked panicked on the sidelines, which tends to translate to your team. #wnba
4373 2018-05-27 17:57:19 >bans bump stocks >soon realizes you can recreate the action of a bump stock by stiffening your finger or using a wood dowel
4374 2018-05-27 17:57:00 C'est une sage décision, rien ne vaut l'or et préserver vous des risques mondiaux , pensez à augmenter votre stock d'or, Chine, Russie, Inde on multiplier leurs stocks d'or.
4375 2018-05-27 17:56:43 Thank you for giving me this page so I can watch their stocks go down.
4376 2018-05-27 17:55:23 We need to work together to lower gun violence in this country.  Bump stocks today, missiles tomorrow, what is the definition of 'right to bear arms'?
4377 2018-05-27 17:53:34 Trailing 12 months on S & P 500 today is 15%! Some stocks on 50%!
4378 2018-05-27 17:52:55 Yes. That $5000 investment in stocks can be taken from you.
4379 2018-05-27 17:51:05 Each of my passions led me to hope for it, gave me a glimpse of stocks
4380 2018-05-27 17:50:57 Bump stocks didn’t do it and neither did the gun.  The problem is with humans.  You’ll be better off when you realize that.
4381 2018-05-27 17:50:39 When you say 'trading' #crypto, you are not trading stocks.

Only the non-visionaries were buying and selling @Microsoft and @Apple shares when they first came out, the smart ones saw the innovation and never looked back.

The risk in #crypto comes from overcomplication.
4382 2018-05-27 17:50:13 Ban bump stocks. Period.

4384 2018-05-27 17:47:23 Done! 
Also looked up some stats: bump stocks allow a semiautomatic rifle to be fired more than 3 times as fast. That’s three times the injury and death.
4385 2018-05-27 17:46:22 Ban bump stocks
4386 2018-05-27 17:45:46 Don’t know who I feel more sorry for, you for having your stocks of premier Italian weasel piss depleted, or Stu for being the poor sod drinking it!

4392 2018-05-27 17:41:37 depends whether I'm tracking the stock during the Box or not. Some stocks surprise, or maybe something new shows up too.
4393 2018-05-27 17:40:30 Mismanagement of resources is the main reason. Only solution is to getting rid of these treacherous swines and ruthless accountability. Otherwise these hogs will sell those stocks also.

4395 2018-05-27 17:40:08 Bump stocks should only be used by police or military.
4396 2018-05-27 17:40:03 BAN TRUMP & BUMP STOCKS!
4397 2018-05-27 17:39:21 I got confused and thought you meant NYSE stocks...
4398 2018-05-27 17:38:02 Yes, it's amazing that even with the NRA's power over their base, that banning bump stocks isn't a 100% no-brainer.
4399 2018-05-27 17:38:01 I agree there's a lot of potential for investors to get companies to behave better. That's not yet mainstream and most of our pensions are probably not in those strategies. You'll be pleased that Somerset does screen out tobacco stocks!

4402 2018-05-27 17:36:29 Ban bump stocks!!!!!!!
4403 2018-05-27 17:35:52 Ban bump stocks!!!
4404 2018-05-27 17:35:51 Baby bump stocks and all automatic weapons.

4406 2018-05-27 17:35:08 Way better stocks out there to mess with
4407 2018-05-27 17:34:37 Banning bump stocks is LITERALLY the least we could do.
4408 2018-05-27 17:34:10 Everything collapses. Money flees Gold and Bitcoin too because nobody can afford to buy. Altcoins collapse. Only Noodle company stocks rise
4409 2018-05-27 17:33:53 if their was a duplicat coppy of Arnold Schwartzenegger Noteri of republic,without a blue ink autograph it probably a fraud. all stocks were listed on tape for a reason 1 page each. the person at the top, takes to noteri
4410 2018-05-27 17:33:52 It is not just Bump stocks . It’s gun in general. Should be banned
4411 2018-05-27 17:33:20 I guess people don’t understand how stocks work- Trout is already best player, so you won’t earn as much. Betts is the choice here- duh
4412 2018-05-27 17:33:12 As a 20 year law enforcement veteran, I had no idea about bump-stocks. I’m for a control of them. Seems they were made for some type of disability. Possibly a doctor confirming someone needs one??? I don’t like bump stocks. Circumvents the automatic weapons ban.

4418 2018-05-27 17:29:29 We should ban the manufacture of bump stocks in US so they can't be sold here or anywhere else. And provide retraining of workers!
4419 2018-05-27 17:29:26 Well Danica just crashed out, just as you predicted!!! Your picking my next round of stocks!
4420 2018-05-27 17:29:02 I've said it before and I'll say it again.  We CAN BAN bump stocks!  No reason to own a bump stock.  Bump stops can only do harm.  Fuck bump stocks!
4421 2018-05-27 17:28:26 I am holding on to certain stocks and intend to hand over to my daughter (she is 7) so I can keep holding.
4422 2018-05-27 17:28:24 FRIP 

TD, just bring back FRIP that you stole from Scottrade clients. FYI,FRIP allowed investors to pool dividends and then allocate them to any five stocks or funds at any monthly at no cost. Balanced holdings, built new positions. Awesome tool lost! Let TD know if you want it.
4423 2018-05-27 17:28:20 Nice goals you set. I’m planning to buy more Canadian dividend growth stocks. What’s a no-brainer besides the banking and telecom stocks? Thanks and good luck!
4424 2018-05-27 17:28:19 Also in terms of #stockstowatch #stocks no 1 teacher can really be all reliable. Do your research. Dont sell from panic and learn learn learn!
Good luck!
4425 2018-05-27 17:27:40 This YG family fanwar won't do anything good. Instead of drag and mock each other in SNS, we can do a project like petition even buy YG stocks as YG family to demand for better management from YG ent. It will help all artist in YG and YG as a company it self.
4426 2018-05-27 17:26:06 Ban bump stocks. It’s the easiest thing to do!
4427 2018-05-27 17:24:33 If we concern elites, while governing planet instability, will continue to gain money, stocks and profits, at an higher rate than the one they'll take responsibility, we should consider that globalism, after globalization, trends slowly driving to fail #UsVsThem
4428 2018-05-27 17:24:20 Ban bump stocks!!
4429 2018-05-27 17:22:19 Petition will work as YG family instead not only one fandom to demand for better management from YG ent. Better if we can buy their stocks. I hope someone can do this project.
4430 2018-05-27 17:21:43 How are you gonna ban bump stocks when everyone I know owns at least 3 of them? 
4431 2018-05-27 17:20:56 That is stock prices vs an economic reboot... stocks can go up and down without any relationship to the economy...
4432 2018-05-27 17:20:49 Add your voice to help ban bump stocks.  #BanBumpStocks
4433 2018-05-27 17:20:48 Not according to everything I learned in business school and on Wall Street. Heck, we never even hit a single-digit P/E on the S&P 500. Last time stocks were that cheap was 198:  But if you say so.
4434 2018-05-27 17:20:28 No company has ever grown into the valuations nor will any of todays hot stocks. This is how WS excuses paying higher vals. Todays darlings grow their rev on massive debt but don't have profits. Too many companies w/ stunning PEs. You buy em, not me. Remember TSLA & many others?
4435 2018-05-27 17:20:14 The only way this photo could be better is if you were smiling, David!  But, I suppose, we'll be seeing that as soon as those goddamn bump stocks are banned and other reasonable reforms finally pass.
4436 2018-05-27 17:19:36 Help us ban bump stocks.  #BanBumpStocks
4437 2018-05-27 17:17:57 There is no need, not to mention no constitutional protection, for bump stocks. None. #BanBumpStocks
4438 2018-05-27 17:16:17 De bron is onuitputtelijk inderdaad maar dat wil nog zeggen dat de munten niet ten opzichte van elkaar in waarde fluctueren. Dat artikel gaat over yen lenen: 'to buy higher-yielding assets like U.S. stocks.' zie verband niet.
4439 2018-05-27 17:15:40 Instead of do never ending fanwar, it will be better to unite and make petition or anything legal and strong to YG. It works when iKONIC do it. Or like what elf (super junior fan) do long time ago (if I'm not mistaken) they buy SM stocks so they can speak up their opinion.
4440 2018-05-27 17:15:39 Individual stocks in the market are too volatile with little risk/reward benefit for the short term. You really want to invest in a market index fund consistently for the long term.
4441 2018-05-27 17:15:36 Congratulations but when you meet you should also press on rent control, §21 evictions, conserving stocks of social housing, tenant representation post-Grenfell
4442 2018-05-27 17:14:40 Rahul are you an investor in Tesla as well? You speak very highly of it. What you think of ordinary people like me investing in the stocks for the long term?
4443 2018-05-27 17:13:32 Why do you continue? You are a laughing stock and becoming more of a joke every day! Bump stocks have been banned btw. Do something more productive other than try to be a dictator, this is AMERICA! Remember? Debate @KyleKashuv if you dare! And not with @CNN hosting!

4446 2018-05-27 17:11:43 The time is NOW .... Ban Bump Stocks!! #BanBumpStocks
4447 2018-05-27 17:11:32 Bump stocks ... no reason to exist.
4448 2018-05-27 17:09:27 @TheRangeUK are you able to tell me if a store stocks an item? I’ve been looking for a specific kilner jar in your stores that is available online but don’t seem to be able to find it.
4449 2018-05-27 17:08:47 Thank God he didn't do that. Checks were unconstitutional  (and wouldn't have worked) age was dumb (And wouldn't have worked) bump stocks....i forget if they actually happened or not. That one is actually pretty reasonable
4450 2018-05-27 17:07:57 I love that everything the left is resisting & attacking is back firing to our benefit from Laura ingram to fedex stocks to this! Keep it up there, it makes our fight easier! Like MSM & dems r destroying themselves within!
4451 2018-05-27 17:06:42 Ok dude, let’s ban bump stocks
4452 2018-05-27 17:06:39 We need to ban bump stocks. Basically gives anyone the opportunity to create an automatic weapon designed to kill many people. Must be eliminated!!
4453 2018-05-27 17:06:14 No doubt. Then there is the "as part of a well regulated militia" canard, and the "necessary to the security of a free state" WTF Quote of the Day. Bump stocks are ridiculous, and so it that post.
4454 2018-05-27 17:05:15 Learn how to use options to offset your loses and protect you from potential downturns in the overall market & individual stocks, you can use the money gained from them to further compound your investments.
4455 2018-05-27 17:04:40 We so need to ban bump stocks! Needing to ban bump stocks is so far away from taking your guns... or to kill the 2nd amendment. What use is there for bump stocks but to kill masses of innocent people or flocks of beautiful geese/birds? Please search for your humanity.

4458 2018-05-27 17:03:06 No more bump stocks - ban them!
4459 2018-05-27 17:02:48 Ban bump stocks...as a modest start
4460 2018-05-27 17:01:28 B. Continuing to push against reform against sale of military-grade weapons, bump stocks, etc. So how does the NRA not share some of blame?
4461 2018-05-27 17:00:51 Even if you have a decent job DO NOT spend your hard earned cash on frivolous things that lose value over time, invest in stocks that pay dividends & reinvest the returns to compound your interest, eventually your portfolio will be generating more money for you than your job!

4469 2018-05-27 16:52:57 actually their growth as if yesterday is up and stock went up a few percentages as stocks fluctuate but they are still stable and doing well and flying. How about Trumps businesses? Oh their tanking since his presidency. Trump hasnt had any influence on anything 
4470 2018-05-27 16:49:55 Ban bump stocks!
4471 2018-05-27 16:49:28 False. ICs vs Puff is the best mu!  Who doesn't love time outs with 3 stocks each! I know I do!
4472 2018-05-27 16:45:40 conjecture at best. If this is a strategy then maintaing a portfolio of the top 15 stocks by mcap would suffice as that would account for 70 % of nifty by weightage. Selling OTM nifty calls on this base would be more empirical. But not the best use of your capital.
4473 2018-05-27 16:45:07 First check your facts.
Second if you believe in manipulation theory think about banks, money, stocks, derivatives, hedge funds. So lets not talk as if banking world which is regulated is holier than thou.

4476 2018-05-27 16:42:52 You don’t want stocks to trade or be exchanged like bitcoin. They should remain as custody items. This prevents scammers from passing off worthless securities as a means of payment.
4477 2018-05-27 16:42:19 Ban bump stocks now!!!!
4478 2018-05-27 16:42:14 Yes! We should ban bump stocks, large magazines, AR-15s, and raise the age to 21. No, it won't stop all mass shootings, but it is a start!
4479 2018-05-27 16:41:52 So SPY on a weekly is in a triangle - is this DISTRIBUTION Phase?  IMHO YES, so looking for the weak stock now to trade down, noting the strong stocks now for the ride back up
4480 2018-05-27 16:41:48 But O’Neil’s metrics should be admired. They are not only original, but effective. The simplicity and common sense, makes his old school algos beautiful.

4487 2018-05-27 16:37:09 There is no justifiable reason for bump stocks. Why is there a product that converts a legal weapon into an illegal weapon? How can it be legal?

4509 2018-05-27 16:24:20 Ban bump stocks.
4510 2018-05-27 16:22:51 Thanks for all your efforts in this regard. Banning bump stocks would be a good small start.
4511 2018-05-27 16:21:33 Reading William O’Neil, The Successful Investor. There are books on my shelf that throughout the years, I keep revisiting.

4527 2018-05-27 16:12:13 Although it’s very sad it appears that Texans and their representatives are basically ok with school shootings. If a few kids have to die periodically in order for Texans to keep their automatic rifles and bump stocks, it’s all good.
4528 2018-05-27 16:11:42 Ban bump stocks!
4529 2018-05-27 16:10:57 Very true and that is why we need conviction to hold the stocks. Borrowed conviction disappears as soon the price goes down.

4556 2018-05-27 15:57:53 It defies logic that this is even an issue. Banning bump stocks makes so much sense that it is hard to believe anyone could be agaist this.
4557 2018-05-27 15:56:09 ..yes, why are bump stocks even needed..?
4558 2018-05-27 15:55:46 Ban bump stocks. PLEASE. There is no good use for them in our society.

4561 2018-05-27 15:53:45 There is a lot of misconceptions and general lack of knowledge about stocks, and all other forms of investment in the general public, and the vast majority is too lazy to learn.
4562 2018-05-27 15:53:02 Hope so. Game 7 will be epic

4565 2018-05-27 15:51:58 I don't think #foundingFathers had bump stocks in mind when they wrote the #SecondAmendment. #BringBackMuskets #BanBumpStocks #BanAssaultWeapons #GunControlNOW
4566 2018-05-27 15:51:52 Why were bump stocks invented in the first place.  They need to be banned and anyone who manufactures them should be criminally prosecuted.  Bump stocks = death.
4567 2018-05-27 15:51:45 No bump stocks. No bump stocks. No bump stocks.X 1 billion
4568 2018-05-27 15:50:16 Ban bump stocks now.
4569 2018-05-27 15:49:40 We need to do more than ban bump stocks.
4570 2018-05-27 15:48:33 @Driftfotos Larry, I saw your post about shooting motorsports on film; I'm trying to make a decision about film stock for shooting at the IOM TT next week.  Any thoughts on 35mm color film stocks for motorsports shooting?  Thanks much, love your work!
4571 2018-05-27 15:48:33 Ban bump stocks. Enact sensible laws.

4577 2018-05-27 15:42:45 Not at all, you can use the stocks from packs but you're straight up jackin someones designs and changing the color basically do you even know what fx were used to make the stock on the left look like that?
4578 2018-05-27 15:42:36 Ban bump stocks.  Let's get on with this.
4579 2018-05-27 15:42:19 I have 100 dollar

10 dollar in crypto i divide by coin 1 to 10 but 6 dollars is in 1 coin
The only way i get rekt is
1.war in my country 70dollars of my money is qbasically near useless

4581 2018-05-27 15:40:22 If you follow the age of tech, then big gains are still possible. At this point crypto is for tech savy people...kinda like the old computing machines we still have a long ways to go, will the prices surge with the tech...very possible....there are stocks worth 290k so why not?
4582 2018-05-27 15:40:15 If Ireland can make a needed change to their 8th amendment of the constitution act of 1983, the US can change their 2nd amendment & not only ban bump stocks for change all gun laws!

My idea of a perfect portfolio (by value) 

70% (core) in slow compounders, almost zero churn (1 in 3 years) 

20% in growth stocks, low churn (1-2/year)

10% in aggressive bets, irrespective of mktcap, CAN be high churn. 

Note - total stocks <=15
4585 2018-05-27 15:39:30 (Not the same type of print making) but if you have your own large format printer at home, getting each artwork to look correct on different paper stocks is like an all-day task like a science experiment lol I wish there was consistency in my knowledge to share on that matter
4586 2018-05-27 15:39:16 If you,  or anyone,  believes that country has mended its ways and is compliant, then you,  Sir, and your cronies, are the biggest laughing stocks of 2018.
4587 2018-05-27 15:39:03 If you want to buy $100,000 in stocks you need $100,000 and if you want to buy $100,000 in #realestate you only need $20,000 (20% down). #CRE #investing
4588 2018-05-27 15:38:00 Hi Andrew, these limited posters are exclusive to MCM Comic Con while stocks last. If you Dm us you address, we may be able send you one if we have any stock remaining after the show, though we can't make any promises unfortunately
4589 2018-05-27 15:38:00 of course. most kludges do eventually. But as i understand it these stocks are not complicated. people will build them or rig up some kind of rubber band, or whatever. but thats the same problem we have with the guns.they are still worth banning
4590 2018-05-27 15:37:22 Solo did poorly this week but its the first bad weekend for 2018. Box office is still up 5.6% ytd while the movie stocks are down this year.

4592 2018-05-27 15:34:00 @the_greensheep_ stocks a range of CBD products.
4593 2018-05-27 15:33:59 Yes! If, for instance, 3 of every 10 trades are losers & a trader never mentions them, then the 7 winners he brags about are suspect IMO.

I tried Cramer's service for a bit. 1 day he told subscribers he sold out of all stocks but that nite on TV said "Don't cut & run!" He LIES!
4594 2018-05-27 15:33:00 Ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines.
4595 2018-05-27 15:32:59 Please BAN Bump Stocks it is not worth the pain and grief it causes.
4596 2018-05-27 15:32:30 The young people will win... if they live. Ban bump stocks.
4597 2018-05-27 15:30:55 “Good people” don’t need assault weapons or bump stocks. Teachers don’t get paid enough to teach, yet you gun nuts want to add to their load. What about the slaughters happening at concerts, churches, businesses? Send in the teachers??
4598 2018-05-27 15:30:16 Stocks are selling fast @speedmachine silverstone.
Pop in and see us we shut st 6pm today!!
4599 2018-05-27 15:29:32 Let’s ban bump stocks
4600 2018-05-27 15:26:52 The holding gains always source back to deficits though, whether it's stocks, bonds, real estate. Mark-to-market discipline makes the gains seem bigger than they really are.
4601 2018-05-27 15:26:23 Ban the frigging bump stocks. If not, you're an idiot!

4605 2018-05-27 15:24:21 Get rid of bump stocks NOW!!
4606 2018-05-27 15:22:37 Well if you used the un edited stock and made it into your own style yes but blatantly drag and dropping stocks from the psd which is based on that stock is stealing and you shouldnt sell it
4607 2018-05-27 15:22:06 Proof that specific legislation would have stopped these shooters? Lol just stop. The Parkland shooter was like 19 and had flags on his record. At least three laws could have prevented him from getting that gun. The Vegas shooter used bump stocks, which have only now been banned.

4611 2018-05-27 15:20:31 Yeah ? How does ur statement deny what he said ? Trump did say he will van bump stocks. He didn't follow through.tgere is video evidence of he saying it
4612 2018-05-27 15:20:06 Bump stocks turn semis into automatics.  Vegas killer injured 500 in 10 minutes.  If you’re in favor of these — you’re a monster.  Go Parkland #songstrong

4620 2018-05-27 15:15:16 A proper portfolio that produces consistent income consists of appreciating stocks that pay dividends at different times throughout the year or even better each month & bonds that pay you an interest annually.
4621 2018-05-27 15:15:05 vu que les CRS utilisent des stocks périmés ne te précipité 0as
4622 2018-05-27 15:14:38 I know a lot of traders say to wire out your profits after a certain goal is reached but this is a huge mistake. You should be taking your profits and reinvesting them into a long term investing portfolio of dividend & interest paying stocks & bonds.
4623 2018-05-27 15:14:29 More like the "why?" zone. There is so many better stocks to put hard earned money in.
4624 2018-05-27 15:13:05 Van bump stocks to protect innocent lives
4625 2018-05-27 15:11:58 Which is a pretty awesome outcome for almost everyone involved... except for people holding BitTorrent Inc. stocks!!

And that’s where cryptocurrencies for payments fall apart. If they do a good job, hodlers lose money. Good for the world, bad for investors.
4626 2018-05-27 15:11:54 Honestly, I never really thought that much about them before they started coming for the survivors of school shootings. And started ramping up ridiculous smear campaigns whenever a different retailer stopped carrying AR-15s and bump stocks.
4627 2018-05-27 15:11:10 It is time to end this caranage of American lives.  Ban bump stocks is the first step!

4632 2018-05-27 15:08:14 Is the equipment getting the most attention RE greater restrictions (AR-15, bump stocks, etc) used in target practice, competitions, hunting? Or, is their primary utility to kill people? 2A advocates try to distract by saying all guns are targeted.
4633 2018-05-27 15:08:05 Please stop buying #gold to hedge acute stock selloffs. When stocks crash, insurance is usually cashed in. One doesn’t  buy fire insurance when their home is ablaze. They cash it in. Gold insures chronic bear mkts tied to USD earnings debasement.
4634 2018-05-27 15:07:30 Sensible gun control is way past due, and banning bump stocks is one step forward!
4635 2018-05-27 15:07:26 @Steven_Ballmer Look into hedge funds someone said its automatic buying and selling stocks : )
4636 2018-05-27 15:06:52 Ren Tech (Mercer) bought stocks in Vimpelcom (Veon) at a time when the value was dropping. Other traders were perplexed. 

Veon also seems to have recent trade signals of dark pool trading. This is a way to pass large amounts of money... to Veon, Alfa Group, Mother Russia...
4637 2018-05-27 15:06:48 Ban bum stocks
4638 2018-05-27 15:05:57 Ban bump stocks!
4639 2018-05-27 15:05:44 Have to admit to being very disappointed with @WhyArai for not getting stocks of the @tweethutchy replica available for delivery until July! Won’t be wearing that to @iom_tt then. Credit to @SPORTSBIKESHOP for keeping me in the loop though
4640 2018-05-27 15:05:36 There’s no good justification for bump stocks.
4641 2018-05-27 15:05:06 To all Nevada Patriots Steve Sisolak is a Democratic Liberal wack job who says he will not let President Trump push him around and he will ban Assault rifles and Ban bump stocks and Fight the NRA. He is a Serious Threat to our way of life in Nevada
4642 2018-05-27 15:04:06 So you're just not doing the vids, but still going to running Vlad Stocks?
4643 2018-05-27 15:03:08 Ban bump stocks. The right to live without being shot is far more important than some gun nuts right to possess something that is meant to kill more and faster.
4644 2018-05-27 15:02:20 @lizzygurdus your article on Cramer is not correct. Can 529 plan buy stocks?
4645 2018-05-27 15:01:54 Pressure cooker stocks are *very* clear because they don’t boil and agitate even at high temps.
4646 2018-05-27 15:01:54 Ban bump stocks.
4647 2018-05-27 15:01:35 If the #MuslimBakery stocks pork strips for their products, sure, as well as #HebrewBakeries.

But these bakeries should not be expected to make a special purchase, or use their sterile facilities to incorporate customer bought ingredients.
4648 2018-05-27 15:00:28 You know exactly what I mean by assault weapons. 
Bump stocks are readily available online - even to those in states where they are banned.
Gun and safe locks need to be mandatory.
And add a national red flag law and a ban on ALL guns to those under 18 to my list

4667 2018-05-27 14:51:28 Ready?  Ban assault weapons. Raise the minimum age to 21 to purchase guns. Ban bump stocks. Enact Red Flag Laws. Incentive gun buy backs.  Enforce liability insurance on gun owners. Universal background checks. Safe Storage laws. Hold parents accountable.
4668 2018-05-27 14:50:21 Ban stocks! They are wrong in any country!
4669 2018-05-27 14:49:05 The @NRA is funded by every gun manufacturer in existence. Their interests are to move more product.

Assault weapons, extended magazines, bump stocks, etc., & keep the age low so more will buy. Sell to sick minds! Arm schools = sell guns! 

How can you say they aren't involved?
4670 2018-05-27 14:48:52 Bump Stocks are not pretty much a non-issue.
1) The Vegas shooting is the only time I've ever seen them used for murder.
2) No law abiding citizen is using them for anything more than a target shooting novelty due to the lose of accuracy and safety.

Let's address the real issue
4671 2018-05-27 14:48:27 45 even said he'd consider banning bump stocks
4672 2018-05-27 14:47:29 @CocaColaAU The only store closest to me that stocks Coke Stevia in 375ml cans has stopped stocking it. Is that it for the cans now? And will the 1.25ml bottles disappear as well?
4673 2018-05-27 14:47:25 List any other crimes than Las Vegas where the shooter used bump stocks.
4674 2018-05-27 14:46:59 Ban bump stocks.
4675 2018-05-27 14:46:46 On the other hand, if you think it's tough with stocks, try real drawdowns for bills and bonds
4676 2018-05-27 14:46:31 Ban bump stocks
4677 2018-05-27 14:45:29 Dana Loesch has stated, unequivocally that the NRA would never support a ban on bump stocks.

4681 2018-05-27 14:44:01 Neither of these articles support your position that the NRA support a ban on bump stocks. These articles, as well as the NRA's official press release, clearly state that the NRA would support a review of the possibility of additional regulation on bump stocks -- not a ban.
4682 2018-05-27 14:43:21 Ban bump stocks.
4683 2018-05-27 14:43:20 Keeping  bump stocks  legal begs the question...why not RPGs, army tanks, armed drones, atom bombs, new  undreamed of weapons of mass destruction, etc.  Surely there is a line.   And surely, bump stocks are over the line.  Why is this even a debate?  Ban them now!
4684 2018-05-27 14:43:17 So? Fuck you, Mikey. I  bump stocks.
4685 2018-05-27 14:42:19 I am curious to understand, why is such high levels of cash required? Especially in a patient, long-term, low churn portfolio? 

Was the move to cash in end 2017 based on valuations of existing positions (& hence took some chips off) or taken out of stocks that seemed risky? 
Thx
4686 2018-05-27 14:42:19 I hope they were good and tight. I want to see him in pain. I'd love to see him in a set of stocks so we could throw rotten veggies in his face.

4697 2018-05-27 14:34:05 As a compassionate and rational human being, I loudly proclaim my support of a ban on bump stocks.
4698 2018-05-27 14:33:24 Assault weapons? A knife is an assault weapon if used to assault. Bump stocks are illegal.Gun and gun safe locks are supported by law enforcement and NRA. you mean the gun safes that req. fingerprints for access? money from NRA?  Absolutely hold parents accountable. We agree!
4699 2018-05-27 14:33:15 Nope. One can trade in future. I will also trade in future when I do trend following in stocks. But there's a possibility of making it in option, I would prefer that. It depends on each view.
4700 2018-05-27 14:31:57 CNA orders from the pre order period din kaya lahat ng first stocks may posters/p.o. ..kaya din po sabay sabay dating ng pre order sa kanila and sa physical shops.. the only difference is may 10% off ka from their original price ng CNA if sa pre order period ka nag order :)
4701 2018-05-27 14:31:55 Get rid of bump stocks
4702 2018-05-27 14:31:28 Banning bump stocks is useless. You can achieve the same effect with a belt loop or shoestring. You want to ban those too?
4703 2018-05-27 14:31:10 BAN BUMP STOCKS #BanBumpStocks
4704 2018-05-27 14:30:58 Are you still doing stocks?  Is that how you afford all this or do your parents help a little?
4705 2018-05-27 14:30:26 Bump stocks are not the problem, people are the problem. Especially people like Hogg who seeks to take advantage of the tragic death of these students.
4706 2018-05-27 14:30:09 Stop pointing out the problems, Steve, and start offering solutions. Otherwise, stick to your stocks
4707 2018-05-27 14:29:50 ...if you leave your money in a bank, the only person you have to blame for your poor investment advice is staring at you in the mirror. Move your money to a brokerage account and pick a few very-long term stocks.
4708 2018-05-27 14:29:47 Yes. Ban Bump Stocks
4709 2018-05-27 14:29:36 Please ban bump stocks!!!  Remember those who died in Las Vegas!
4710 2018-05-27 14:28:33 He made it personal, I wish it had something to do with stocks but it doesn't. Guy went out on a limb to distort truth and call me an anti-semite by lying
4711 2018-05-27 14:28:11 Ban bump stocks already before more people die.
4712 2018-05-27 14:27:50 I would say ylthe fishing for sure
4713 2018-05-27 14:27:14 Hard to think what I enjoyed more.. the football or the fishing afterwards !
4714 2018-05-27 14:26:11 It’s fair to say you enjoyed last night 
4715 2018-05-27 14:25:40 1. don't take NRA money
2. support ban on assault weapons and bump stocks
3. support prosecuting anyone, including parents, whose guns are used by a child to shoot someone
4. support gun and gun safe locks and fingerprint ID
Specific enough?
4716 2018-05-27 14:25:14 Yes,,,,Canterbury shop near Chichibunomiya Stadium stocks a selection, as do other sports stores in Tokyo/Yokohama.
4717 2018-05-27 14:25:05 I could think of another word with a capital C for him...
4718 2018-05-27 14:24:56 Ban F ing bump stocks !!!
4719 2018-05-27 14:24:32 Trump directed Sessions to look at banning bump stocks; surely most people can agree it’s at least a good step considering they’re the reason so many were killed in Vegas.
4720 2018-05-27 14:24:07 Ban bump stocks!
4721 2018-05-27 14:23:42 Ban Bump stocks!
4722 2018-05-27 14:23:27 Ban bump stocks...
Ban guns...
Impeach Trump
4723 2018-05-27 14:23:00 Banning bump stocks is the LEAST we can do. Next gun owners will demand RPGs...
4724 2018-05-27 14:22:20 Hi Salil,
Too much diversification ruins the returns badly. A collective mix of 15-18 stocks is more than enough to build a well-diversified portfolio.
4725 2018-05-27 14:21:50 bon hollister remettez des stocks ça  saoule là
4726 2018-05-27 14:20:49 Pass ban bump stocks!
4727 2018-05-27 14:19:57 Ban bump stocks.  Make gun ownership a privilege instead of a right.  #NRAIsATerroristOrganization
4728 2018-05-27 14:19:01 Ban Bump Stocks!
4729 2018-05-27 14:18:02 Educate yourself before you post . 30 mill from NRA - after Las Vegas he said he was going to ban bump stocks, raise the age to 21, and pursue sensible gun control ... then he met with his biggest campaign donor , the NRA and he dropped it all .
4730 2018-05-27 14:16:45 Ban bump stocks.
4731 2018-05-27 14:16:20 define rich? Most of his wealth is in stocks which he wouldn't sell unless to pay for tax. So that wealth is tied up in assets and the companies which produce jobs and prosperity because a lot of this produced, build and sourced inside the #US while Bezos sells china stuff mostly
4732 2018-05-27 14:15:27 I'm against bump stocks#banbumpstocks
4733 2018-05-27 14:13:04 GUO YIN UNITY stocks slump
4734 2018-05-27 14:11:25 I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope! Donald Trump - seems so long ago! Was he lying then or is he lying now?
4735 2018-05-27 14:11:14 It would be a matter of so called “national security” to charge a world leader - stocks would tumble and blah, blah, blah
4736 2018-05-27 14:10:55 We can ban bump stocks#
4737 2018-05-27 14:10:12 Ban bump stocks!
4738 2018-05-27 14:10:01 I'm with you, David. They're not needed for home defense, they're not needed for hunting. Bump stocks help shooters kill more people. Period.

4742 2018-05-27 14:05:33 But investors follow this strategy and end up cluttering their portfolio with way too many stocks
4743 2018-05-27 14:05:30 This is something I need to look into. Pay into a private sector work pension (it won't be great). Have a stocks and shares isa (75%) and a nominee account (25%) focussed mainly on capital growth. Looking at sipps and Lisa.
4744 2018-05-27 14:05:21 Bump stocks serve no purpose other than to facilitate mass casualties!
4745 2018-05-27 14:04:50 The question that will never get answered is whether gun manufacturers and associated industries are making guns too lethal for such lawful uses and in effect encouraging their illegal use: bump stocks, extended magazines and such.
4746 2018-05-27 14:03:46 Main lobby for "cashless society" (fully bank-centered electronic money) in Sweden was AFAIK Swedish Bankers' Assoc.
Before, banks could put your savings account money in e.g. weapons stocks, but not if you withdrew the money.
After, you can't withdraw, only move to other member.
4747 2018-05-27 14:03:38 Just tell ur wife”OMG... the risk of trade war is increasing!! Stocks are moving violently.”
4748 2018-05-27 14:03:16 Bump stocks should be banned.
4749 2018-05-27 14:03:10 I just paid fory LLC for Indie record @DollaGettin if we are blessed with $10,000 for funding we would use it for promotions, marketing, products, set up a tour, travel expenses, save a little, and Thank God !!! Then put a little into stocks, and invest .
4750 2018-05-27 14:03:05 Ban bump stocks!
4751 2018-05-27 14:00:47 Washington banned bump stocks, the one action our Legislature took.
4752 2018-05-27 13:59:02 They already banned bump stocks in the recent school safety bill

4754 2018-05-27 13:58:46 Banning bump stocks would be a good, common-sense beginning. #BanBumpStocks
4755 2018-05-27 13:57:39 Bump stocks can be banned without action from congress and THEY SHOULD BE.
4756 2018-05-27 13:57:36 You should invest it in frozen orange juice and pork belly stocks.

4771 2018-05-27 13:52:51 Ban bump stocks now.
4772 2018-05-27 13:52:36 What legitimate  place do bump stocks have in civilization? Asking for a number of dead friends in Las Vegas.
4773 2018-05-27 13:52:25 I support the banning of bump stocks.
4774 2018-05-27 13:51:51 We have no need for bump stocks #BanBumpStocks 
Most gun owners are happy to compromise, we need to protect the children, one should feel safe in school
4775 2018-05-27 13:50:50 Please ban bump stocks. Let's stop making it even more ridiculously easy to commit mass murder.
4776 2018-05-27 13:50:46 Ban bump stocks. 1 person’s right to own guns does not outweigh another’s right to live.
4777 2018-05-27 13:50:29 Please ban bump stocks. Let's stop making it even more ridiculously easy to commit mass murder.
4778 2018-05-27 13:49:51 Carlos Correa was who I voted for.  Since I’m buying low now (compared to everyone else in the poll) and have until he’s a still prime(ish) 33 years old.  Isn’t that how you’re supposed to purchase stocks?
4779 2018-05-27 13:49:38 Please ban bump stocks
4780 2018-05-27 13:49:02 Bump stocks were made legal by Obama and the ATF suggested it
4781 2018-05-27 13:49:00 We  didn’t know when you were lying to investors until you got caught.   You should have gone to jail for recommending stocks that in your words were garbage.  Remember that Henry???
4782 2018-05-27 13:48:59 Ban bump stocks!!!
4783 2018-05-27 13:48:39 They do come with the posters but it depends when you buy them, maybe in a few weeks from now they won’t include the posters anymore unless they still have stocks :))
4784 2018-05-27 13:48:10 Super Smell Of Stocks..
4785 2018-05-27 13:47:46 Just to be clear even the NRA supports a ban on bump stocks
4786 2018-05-27 13:47:05 Heh, I doubt it unless it's at some film convention or other ...not the sort of thing my local Oxfam stocks...more tame than wild, sadly ;)
4787 2018-05-27 13:46:46 No bump stocks!
4788 2018-05-27 13:46:32 any bump stocks used in vegas likely saved lives by making the gun un-aimable to any degree of accuracy. BTW news of more than one shooter was leaked yesterday.
4789 2018-05-27 13:45:17 Then in response to the driver being worried about their stocks going down due to anti-prison sentiment, his reply was almost giddy, with the opportunity of building detention centers the future was quite bright. Slightly off-topic, but money’s to be made.
4790 2018-05-27 13:44:47 The journey is long, and you will have many losses along the way before you finally have the “ah ha” moment when things become clear. You realize that realized profits are different than unrealized. You understand that people move stocks and not always the facts present.
4791 2018-05-27 13:44:37 As your trading career evolves it becomes more apparent the lack of rational thought in the market at times. This simply comes from “time under tension”, hours/days/weeks of seeing, studying and trading stocks.

4794 2018-05-27 13:44:05 Let's take just 1 of your meme. Surplus in April which usually always happens because people pay taxes in April. Nothing new or accomplishment. But let's talk how he is blowing up the national debt by 7 trillion because of tax scam. And companies buybacks is for the stocks.
4795 2018-05-27 13:43:03 Yes! I will check is there is still stocks 
4796 2018-05-27 13:42:31 Bump Stocks are nothing more or less than a mechanical device that takes a semi-automatic weapon and in fact makes it a fully automatic weapon.  This is no different than modifying the firing mechanism to make a weapon fully automatic. #BanBumpStocks
4797 2018-05-27 13:41:33 If we're talking stocks I would go with Judge, stocks are all about what's gonna make the most $ and the Yankees are definitely gonna pay this guy.
4798 2018-05-27 13:40:19 If we need bump stocks to protect our freedom, it's already too late. We need to ban bump stocks as a step toward rational gun laws and let the Constitution protect our freedom. Rule of law.

4800 2018-05-27 13:39:12 Wake up and BAN BUMP STOCKS!!!
4801 2018-05-27 13:38:33 Gas prices rising, stocks stagnant, home sales falling as interest rates rise. I predict car sales will wane and jobs’ numbers fall. All part of GOP tax cuts and handling of the economy. But corps and shareholders are looking good with their tax cuts and buybacks.
4802 2018-05-27 13:38:00 except press is not here to be trusted, press is here to make money (ppl owning stocks understand that) 1 -> less income 2 -> less income 3 -> more expenditures. Maybe 2+3 would work on small market (not many ppl would buy subscription)
4803 2018-05-27 13:37:42 CT is 1 of 5 states that has banned bump stocks - let’s make our voices heard to get this done in the USA
4804 2018-05-27 13:37:00 Ban bump stocks and pass Common Sense gun laws.
4805 2018-05-27 13:36:56 No one needs bump stocks, or any rapid fire weapon. Only military personnel should have those. And people, your precious 2nd amendment doesn’t give you the right to “bare” arms. Look it up, you illiterate goons.
4806 2018-05-27 13:34:55 Trumps admin has been negotiating trade deals with individual countries. Blanket trade deals tend to screw over the US. Obama failed to improve US trade deals in 8 years as president. To say we are in an worst position now is dishonest. Look at  GDP, unemployment, Stocks, income
4807 2018-05-27 13:34:03 Ban bump stocks NOW!

4812 2018-05-27 13:30:33 Need to explain programmatic ads to your Mom? It's like the stock market, except ad impressions are traded instead of stocks.
4813 2018-05-27 13:30:20 Only-fund investor , will look at his fund returns regularly.
Only-stock investor will look at his stock returns.
If he is both, surely he will neglect funds and will be rich there. He will sell/buy stocks regularly and forget funds. After long time he will be surprisd positivly
4814 2018-05-27 13:30:11 ...I have a problem with growth-stock investing. Companies tend not to grow at high rates forever. Businesses change... Markets mature. Competition can increase.

4857 2018-05-27 13:08:58 See M2 money supply of India.... govt printing money like crazy ..value of rupee reaching zero and stocks will reach infinity
4858 2018-05-27 13:08:32 Besides. Who needs bump stocks? Most any one can pull a trigger just as fast. So, your plight is futile.
4859 2018-05-27 13:04:51 You realize a bump stock doesn’t change the ROF mechanically just the recoil allowing the shooter to hold down the trigger. Therefore it simulates a fully automatic but is still semi. I don’t agree with bump stocks no need for them.

4862 2018-05-27 13:00:37 We can ban bump stocks
4863 2018-05-27 12:59:59 Sir looking osm. Apne yellow pehna hai to csk hi jeetega your prediction is always right. Ek baar level bhi bta dete score ka, Jaise stocks ka btate ho aap.
4864 2018-05-27 12:58:06 1. Bump stocks cause the recoil of a semi-automatic weapon to bump the trigger against the shooter's finger so he can get off more shots without having to manually squeeze the trigger for each shot. It allows a shooter to get more shots, quicker.
4865 2018-05-27 12:55:38 Ban bump stocks
4866 2018-05-27 12:55:06 I hate late stage capitalism! I prefer the old way of debtor's prison, being placed in the stocks for public humiliation, sent to another continent to be an indentured servant, or being sent to the fuckin guillotine because I couldn't pay my taxes.
4867 2018-05-27 12:53:25 “Bump Weapon”??  Am I missing something? I’m gonna go out a limb and assume she means bump stocks...
4868 2018-05-27 12:53:20 Ban bump stocks!
4869 2018-05-27 12:51:28 The Phony Clinton Foundation
4870 2018-05-27 12:50:22 What % of all the stocks composing various market indices is held in professional (in the sense of the article) portfolios? They probably represent an important proportion of the market. Do these portfolios just end up mimicking the market or could we say they become the market?
4871 2018-05-27 12:49:21 I have sometimes had weird situations where could buy in one account but not another. Both iWeb stocks and shares. Previously they have fixed it straight away.
4872 2018-05-27 12:49:10 1/ @netflix is a public trading company, it’s stocks’d crash if Obama is indicted, that means we on Twatter have a good chance to make it happen if everybody tags #Obamagate, #BoycottNetflix in our every tweet. We need big accounts like @Cernovich @JackPosobiec to make it happen
4873 2018-05-27 12:48:46 So, your objection is that bump stocks only killed 59 people and injured 489 people at the same time, so why bother?

You aren't about "gun truth", you're just another mouth for the NRA that vomits their propaganda.
4874 2018-05-27 12:48:38 Please banning bump stocks should be easy it is the least we could do
4875 2018-05-27 12:48:36 @Baircave has buy with angry stocks ! :(
4876 2018-05-27 12:47:43 Bump stocks are not used for hunting.   Other that for the military, it appears to me that entertainment is the only non-murderous option for these devices.  Is entertainment worth the cost of human life that we saw in LasVegas?  Please save live.  Ban bump stocks.
4877 2018-05-27 12:47:34 Ban bump stocks now. They have nothing to do with 1st amendment.
4878 2018-05-27 12:47:27 Gabes dad is so sweet. Every time he knows we’re coming over he stocks the fridge & he offers to pay for a movie for us.

4882 2018-05-27 12:46:23 I think most successful companies become dividend stocks, but it could take decades

4884 2018-05-27 12:45:05 also TB never decided what to do with stocks anyway, stocks are entirely handled by genna because as tb would say shes much smarter than he is.
4885 2018-05-27 12:45:03 Done. 58 reasons to ban bump stocks. Ask Los Vegas.
4886 2018-05-27 12:43:51 Definitely ban bump stocks
4887 2018-05-27 12:43:12 If sections of the #oceans were dedicated solely to #power #generation they would also function as #marine #sanctuaries allowing #fish stocks to recover. The underside of the #generation could be designed to become mini #reefs.
4888 2018-05-27 12:43:09 Bump Stocks are clever, but  DEADLY. #Ban Bump Stocks
4889 2018-05-27 12:43:04 Ban bump stocks!!  There is no rational argument to allowing public citizens to own them.  They have become weapons of mass destruction.  We are willing to go to war over the idea of weapons of mass destruction against other nations.   How about at home!
4890 2018-05-27 12:40:57 Two ex-Googlers have a replacement for your local vape shop: a refrigerated locker that only stocks one product per day.
4891 2018-05-27 12:40:42 I agree. No individual stocks here since I sold ETFC in 2008 before it totally tanked. Lost plenty of my hat anyway. Fortunately, it was a small hat.

4900 2018-05-27 12:36:14 $JPZY down 65% just today alone. Show me any stock that yields $1 million starting with just 54 shares. All penny stocks, $JBZY, are pure speculation and high risk/reward. I have $TSLA stock. Only stock that I don’t place stop-loss. Do not expect to make $1 million. Not gambling
4901 2018-05-27 12:34:55 pour toutes commandes de sticker, voir @Patatatrac si il reste des stocks :), j'aurai du le préciser après la photo.
4902 2018-05-27 12:34:51 Absolutely. Way more here than a bad business move. This circle knows all are in the cross hairs. Losing half subscribers, tanked stocks don't matter.

Watch for the series of a sympathetic, Set Up politcian.
Others targeting a few Hinkleys, Tsarnaevs, etc
4903 2018-05-27 12:33:37 Not to mention if you actually pick stocks not an index fund. Typical bear rhetoric. What do they have to say to anyone who held $AMZN $NFLX $BKNG for 20 plus years.... and so many more names?
4904 2018-05-27 12:31:19 Ayoye! Les stocks vont baisser. Je me garoche chez COSTCO...

4908 2018-05-27 12:28:24 Check out DNP,  which invests in high yield stocks and bonds.  Trades between 7 and 12 and pays out 6 to 10% consistently.  It will drop as rates rise, but just keep holding and buy more to average down your cost basis.
4909 2018-05-27 12:28:20 Ban those horrible bump stocks and keep them where they belong...in a legal war zone! 
4910 2018-05-27 12:28:11 Hope this rain ends the crushing of mid cap stocks

4913 2018-05-27 12:24:27 If I needed an income portfolio right now, I'd mix REITs, high yield stocks, and cash for the next year in with some bonds.  Interest rates are moving up, so bond prices will fall until rates plateau.
4914 2018-05-27 12:22:28 FIRST GOOD MOVE IN FRONT OF BEST FINANCE MINISTER OF INDIA
4915 2018-05-27 12:21:48 If I could take the time I’ve wasted watching snap stories I didn’t give a fuck about and would have used it on like a book on how to be good at trading stocks I’d have to change my name to Jordan Belfort

4919 2018-05-27 12:18:57 Volatility is now normal, returning from recent lows. A one percent daily move is the historic average. Volatility is not a predictor of declining stocks. It is a trailing or coincident indicator.

4921 2018-05-27 12:14:00 Ban bump stocks.

4933 2018-05-27 12:06:15 @MONEY Can you tell us how much of the 84% of stocks owned by the 10% is owned by the .1 of 1%.
4934 2018-05-27 12:05:28 The Financial Professors may tell you to invest in stocks based upon coefficients of correlation (-1 to +1). The smaller the difference, the better it is.

But the common sense investing will tell you to invest in the stocks across different sectors.
4935 2018-05-27 12:05:15 I am in favor of banning bump stocks
4936 2018-05-27 12:04:57 ごめん、27分着ですすみません

4942 2018-05-27 11:57:56 What do you mean? I’m doing fantastic.  Between tax cuts and the stocks ive never been better. I’m sorry if you’re not. I’ll send my thoughts and prayers for you.
4943 2018-05-27 11:57:02 A reminder. The same people now attacking the climate for quick, short-term profits will sell all those stocks short if they calculate a better "return."
4944 2018-05-27 11:54:52 Ban bump stocks

4947 2018-05-27 11:52:22 Call me weird. I intraday trade stocks and i swingtrade and invest long term crypto with a smaller amount of capital. I say people freaking out need to scale down their positions and zoom out.
4948 2018-05-27 11:49:58 Ban the bump stocks.
4949 2018-05-27 11:49:17 They just won’t go away.

4962 2018-05-27 11:33:56 Taxation  has nothing to do with the value of money. Think of money as a device similar to stocks. It has value as long the numbers add up.
4963 2018-05-27 11:33:26 I experienced a massive paradigm shift in my own life that I believe is possible for almost anyone else.

That paradigm shift is financial independence, which can be achieved by living below your means and investing in high-quality dividend growth stocks.
4964 2018-05-27 11:33:05 Just to show how long it’s been - I was just checking on my lasagne stocks. I’ve one open pack with BB date of Jan 2017

4967 2018-05-27 11:29:01 Shankar Sharma is a shameless market operator manipulating stocks in scams and insider info. If I remember correctly, HFCL is one such example of his thuggery.
4968 2018-05-27 11:28:18 Bump stocks have no place in general society!
4969 2018-05-27 11:28:06 “Stocks did not fly like balloons in any direction. As if attracted by a magnet, they had a defined upward or downward trend which, once established, tended to continue. Within this trend stocks moved in a series of frames, or what I began to call ‘boxes.’” #darvas

4993 2018-05-27 11:08:11 I apologize for saying Psychology is bs. I’m most def going to cop some books. Reading about the market psychology behind stocks was fye. I can only imagine what I’ll be able to apply it to in other aspects life. Feels like a cheat code to reading people
4994 2018-05-27 11:06:33 Background checks are a thing, gunshow loophole is a myth, last shooter was below the current age already, bump stocks don't make that much of a difference, regulations are the literal opposite of freedom.
4995 2018-05-27 11:06:18 Ban Bump Stocks.
4996 2018-05-27 11:03:35 BAN BUMP STOCKS!

4998 2018-05-27 11:00:29 Ban BUMP STOCKS NOW
4999 2018-05-27 11:00:19 If Republican lawmakers want to stop the Banks from taking these actions, it's simple.  Do yourself what the Banks are presently doing for you... take action.  Do something... anything, to show you actually care about the American public. Start by banning bump-stocks nationally.
5000 2018-05-27 10:59:01 Not saying that no one else made a mistake but yes obviously the fact he’s the goalkeeper is why them errors have been highlighted, yes the players are wrong for not going to him I’m just saying it’s obvious they were annoyed.
5001 2018-05-27 10:58:25 After Parkland President Trump said he was directing the DOJ to take care of bump stocks. He said don't worry that's been done. It hasn't #LieGate. All sound and fury signifying nothing.

5012 2018-05-27 10:51:00 No other Liverpool player made a mistake last night then ? He’s just a keeper so it gets highlighted more, pretty confident there would have been several shit touches, missed placed passes. At least he had the bollocks to go to the fans and apologise, on his own!!!!!!

5017 2018-05-27 10:47:49 sir, I don't comment much. Could you please help me understand one thing: there are many great stocks with solid fundamentals. But they never get the lift that other not-so-great stocks do. Why is that?

5021 2018-05-27 10:44:53 Ban Bump Stocks!  It just makes sense.
5022 2018-05-27 10:44:26 I respect the Constitutional right of Americans to own guns. I also believe that right is not unlimited and bump stocks have no place at home, although no doubt those Americans who want to be ready to rise up against their government will disagree on those points.
5023 2018-05-27 10:44:25 Actions speaks louder then words. Put your money where you're mouth is, short Tesla stocks.

5025 2018-05-27 10:42:11 Please do the common sense thing and ban bump stocks!
5026 2018-05-27 10:42:07 "Get in to $25k of debt to get a degree I probably won't need or use? yes please!"

5029 2018-05-27 10:40:15 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
5030 2018-05-27 10:38:54 Not one single logical reason to justify bump stocks!

Stocks still at risk for big fall in 2018.

5042 2018-05-27 10:11:29 I’m not a fan of bump stocks, but I find this post offensive. What does being a Christian have to do with this? The fundamental flaw, among gun control proponents, is they see guns and accessories as morally wrong. That’s why David Hogg’s efforts fail, he makes it a moral issue.

5055 2018-05-27 09:46:25 Today when there is no buying.. and stk prices are languishing..why nobody is recommending stocks?...
Even contra/value investors are not mentioning stocks...
5056 2018-05-27 09:45:46 Enough is enough.  Ban bump stocks
5057 2018-05-27 09:45:00 Les tokens Pu'er Coin adossés à du thé tibétain se sont finalement révélés frauduleux. En réalité, les stocks de thé étaient très faibles, les cours manipulés, et les promesses irréalistes. 3000 Chinois y ont perdu l’équivalent de 47 millions de dollars.
5058 2018-05-27 09:44:43 The toughest job of a financial advisor is not to recommend top stocks; but to explain why top performing stocks or funds will be bad for an investor. Any advisor who pitches for 10% guaranteed return after markets have run up 25% should start looking for an alternate career :-)
5059 2018-05-27 09:43:52 Prior to the shooting in Vegas, a massive majority had never heard of bump stocks. And in their history they have only ever been used in that one crime.  Let's also remember you.can bump fire with a belt loop.. but of.course you knew that already.

5082 2018-05-27 09:08:53 Example-a while ago, one manager picked all the wrong stocks (bad decisions), plus underweighted the class (bad decision). Eq did so well that it led them to beat their RPI+ target despite this. That’s bad m/ment, despite beating b/m.  Fund features & manager perf are separate.
5083 2018-05-27 09:05:36 One of the reasons I deactivated was because of the clout queens and toxic people who dissed other members when the stocks of the fan party goods were mistranslated. At least we now know who are the fans who actually have the audacity to blame other members

5089 2018-05-27 08:58:16 Gold’s inefficiency of real global small transfer has made it lost its medium of exchange function to something much more versatile. 

The current MoE incumbent has a very nasty habit of growing and thus relegate its very short term SoV function to the right PoW Stocks.
5090 2018-05-27 08:56:45 Dreadful as this is, I am more worried about food supply. Do we have assurances that food retailers will be able to maintain stocks when Brexit happens? I assume a large fraction is UK-sourced, but massively slowing down and increasing costs for non-UK looks dangerous?
5091 2018-05-27 08:56:28 BH only have BTS, they don't own stocks in tv stations & don't have any mean of pressure. They wanna debut more groups, but a beef with broadcasts stations would kill any futur project in the egg. To be blacklisted, even when famous can end a career (like JYJ) so imagine rookies
5092 2018-05-27 08:55:57 The wine and the cheese? Lol
Honestly the crash course in F/A refreshers can reignite interest in stocks maybe you have not invested in for a while or are not on radar. It's always useful to know as much as you can and never stop intaking information. Usually some P/E and V/C's 2

5120 2018-05-27 08:16:52 There is no legitimate reason for bump stocks to be available to the public.

5125 2018-05-27 07:59:10 The companies that received the tax cuts (the real cuts not the crumbs real people were thrown) have already used that money to buy back stocks and enrich their stockholders and themselves at YOUR expense.. that's a fact.

5136 2018-05-27 07:49:12 Trading on insider information, selling off before stocks went down and doing so because he knew the stocks were going down. Perfectly legal for them to do. I guess. 
They make the laws. They are going to exempt themselves from being accountable for breaking laws while in office.
5137 2018-05-27 07:47:32 In any case basic point estimate of Average of return (or CAGR if you will) would quickly reduce the stocks in two buckets interesting and not interesting
5138 2018-05-27 07:45:53 What if the Stocks Price is already low, meaning profits already at a low (semua ikat perut), high prices coz of gst, so now gst gone,  stock price would be just a bit less, or no change at all.
5139 2018-05-27 07:44:35 The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a model that describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets, particularly stocks.
5140 2018-05-27 07:42:35 Nothing wrong with safety. I have experienced the tech wrech, GFC & some pretty amazing runs on stocks that i didnt take the safety option n got wiped & lost them testicles. Rolled hard again after each n came back. Took me 20 yrs 2 put safety rule in.

5144 2018-05-27 07:37:13 Bump stocks don't kill.  Have you fired a weapon?
We should start gunpowder.  This the propellant.
5145 2018-05-27 07:34:16 @CrossCountryUK good morning some observations from yesterday travelled return 1st class Derby to Leeds a journey of 100 minutes on neither journey were there any stocks of the enhanced offering 09.16 out 18.11 appears you need to load more. I will say the crews on both were fab.
5146 2018-05-27 07:34:07 Hey Daniel! I've just checked our stock and I can confirm that the Winterstroke Road store stocks Energy of the Daleks. As it's a popular product I'd advise giving them a call on 0117 966 3064 before heading out. They open at 10! Luke
5147 2018-05-27 07:32:43 Awesomeness. “While stocks last” has just lost its meaning.

5150 2018-05-27 07:24:55 Y’all should invest your money into property and stocks like @21savage
5151 2018-05-27 07:23:57 Biggest liquidity dictates the market. You can check this behavior also in stocks. Individual stocks are correlated to the index. That's how money flows. Price action chooses the path of least resistance, for the biggest amount of money.

All that said, bump stocks circumnavigate safety and operational features, so I'm fine losing those.
5153 2018-05-27 07:22:43 Kill.  I strongly opposr assault rifles (even though one if my neohews does own one if those too), I think bump stocks should be illegal, I also recognize that assault rigles are not the only guns used in school shootings (just the worst).  Where I I offend most people is I

5156 2018-05-27 07:21:56 Responsible gun owners have a clear and reasonable purpose for owning a gun, and don’t own more gun than they reasonably need for that purpose. There is no reasonable civilian purpose for owning bump stocks.
5157 2018-05-27 07:21:07 Of course,ban bump stocks!  They are entirely unrelated to our Second Amendment rights.

Just because few stocks are expensive, doesn’t mean they are not worth a buy. Similarly, a cheap stock doesn’t guarantee wealth creation.

5186 2018-05-27 06:52:59 Just give it space. I dont let anybody disrespect me or the team. Btw you wrecked bitcoin. I think its funny cause you got mega stocks and some of those guys were bragging alot
5187 2018-05-27 06:51:48 Bump stocks be banned and the NRA be damned.
5188 2018-05-27 06:51:22 1. You're not qualified to diagnose her grasp on reality.
2. It absolutely IS about Constitutional rights, as experience amply shows your side has no intention of stopping at bump stocks.
3. To categorize any rifle, bump stock or not, as a weapon of mass destruction is idiocy.
5189 2018-05-27 06:49:08 If you mean me, no of course not, and neither are all guns, but some are, and bump stocks, which were the original object in question here, definitely are. You can’t possibly give me another use for that except MAYBE target practice, which STILL makes no sense...

The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a model that describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets, particularly stocks.
5193 2018-05-27 06:45:08 Bump stocks improve the ability to kill more people. Along with assault rifles they should be banned, they have no business in civilian hands.
5194 2018-05-27 06:43:57 Public... You are pathetic and have so far lost thousands of customers, I look forward to watching the store closings and your stocks falling.
5195 2018-05-27 06:41:18 Preserving capital is paramount though.... better to cop a small loss than to lose it all in the end.... the guys here do a good job in calling out some of the bs on some stocks... but if you’re emotionally attached, you won’t even consider any opposing views.

5201 2018-05-27 06:37:49 And I’m the same at the moment with how I invest..if I think things are starting to go south though, I’m out. 

I pulled out of one of my other long term stocks not that long ago,simply because management opted not to exercise their options.... then push a CR. Was a good decision
5202 2018-05-27 06:37:33 No good reason for bump stocks, except to make weapons more dangerous. Ban them now!

5218 2018-05-27 06:16:34 Just when I thought I couldn’t improve my formula for stocks I end up doing it. Easy money.
5219 2018-05-27 06:15:58 That’s why things like bump stocks are stupid and shouldn’t be allowed, they have no purpose. A bump stock used for hunting as you mention would destroy the meat, and make the kill in vain. The animal dies for no reason. We saw in Vegas what these things can do, no other thing...
5220 2018-05-27 06:15:53 In good news today, I found a place to get stuff that would allow me start experimenting with making some crazy rich broths/stocks for things like pho, ramen, and other soups.

5227 2018-05-27 06:08:28 Fuck god ... sure

I agree that bump stocks not important.

5240 2018-05-27 05:58:47 Sure in the short term calls have gone wrong if you have the guts to recommend and guarantee returns please do this bhai 
If investors do not have the capacity to take pains in the short term then please don't invest in stocks
5241 2018-05-27 05:58:32 Cryptocurrency.  Stocks. When you make good investments you can do what you want. I know you know it all too well
5242 2018-05-27 05:57:25 There's no point in kicking yourself for missing an opportunity that was outside of your strategy. 

I see stocks going thru the roof everyday. But 90% of the time, I don’t jump on them, simply because they’re outside of my circle of competence.

Then stay racist. Yeah I can’t support that
5256 2018-05-27 05:33:41 Another to watch is @OakleighCharger Riley Collier-Dawkins. Good mover and great size, booming kick and launched two goals from outside 50 today for Vic Metro. Stocks have to be rising #AFLDraft
5257 2018-05-27 05:33:22 Facts are:
Publix will now feel OUR boycott, and we don't need their money.
Boycott didn't change @IngrahamAngle 's position at Fox.
Who cares? We're totally capable of buying our own guns.
Very few of us ever bothered with bump stocks.
When we're dead, we won't care. Still win.
5258 2018-05-27 05:32:19 Please ban bump stocks, assault weapons, and toughen background checks

5266 2018-05-27 05:25:49 Bump stocks is a no brainer. We need to simply license guns and gun owners same as we do cars, require insurance, and have really stiff penalties for anyone caught with a gun and no license
5267 2018-05-27 05:23:38 Ban bump stocks immediately!
5268 2018-05-27 05:21:37 bump stocks only used once and sketchy.
pistol grips, wut? criminal just cut plastic off.
same if they wanted automatics, a guy in CA was caught building them.
ammo limits? reloading is always an option.
gun free zones are basically criminal arcade shooting galleries
5269 2018-05-27 05:21:16 Universal background checks, closing the gunshow loophole, raising the age you can purchase a wepon, banning bump stocks,  basically more regulations
5270 2018-05-27 05:21:09 The Second Amendment does not protect bump stocks.

5272 2018-05-27 05:19:39 I'm using TWS from IB for stocks and options. E*Trade Pro sucks for options trading. TOS is good. It's little bit complicated, but originally it appeared for trading options and futures. I like it more than TWS. I'm using it for charts, free data and occasional paper trading.
5273 2018-05-27 05:19:37 Ban bump stocks. Put the NRA out of business.
5274 2018-05-27 05:18:02 Of course, ban bump stocks!

5280 2018-05-27 05:15:19 I'm all for guns but really alot of people don't understand that they don't want to take guns away. They want to ban bump stocks and do better background checks. Who needs mass killing guns?

5282 2018-05-27 05:11:44 Imagine getting Buffon over for a season as a rotation keeper / mentor. I’ve not been stoked with our GK stocks since Reina.
5283 2018-05-27 05:10:33 I don’t want to ban all guns. I would like to see assault weapons off the streets, but I know it is very unlikely to happen. What should already be in place is universal background checks, banning bump stocks, giving schools armed officers/guards (not teachers w guns), etc
5284 2018-05-27 05:08:33 I think the family stocks just went

5292 2018-05-27 05:04:29 Just change their name to "Abortion-stocks", and the GOP will have a bill to ban them in no time.
5293 2018-05-27 05:04:28 Preferred stocks are interest rate sensitive. As rates fall, prices of the stock tend to rise and vice versa.

If yes, did @NSEL_official lodged a claim for them??
If yes, was the claim settled by the insurance company?
If not, why?

5310 2018-05-27 04:52:13 Please get rid of bump stocks. There is no need for them but to kill!  
5311 2018-05-27 04:52:07 I’m 18 and I wanna start investing in stocks but I don’t know anything about them and I don’t know where to start. Any tips? No text found
5312 2018-05-27 04:51:19 Seriously, you're way off.  They're literally becoming commonplace.  I agree we have problems beyond just guns, but tougher regulations anndd enforcing them as well as banning bump stocks etc needs to be done.
5313 2018-05-27 04:50:26 Says it all! University is a bubble; stocks are in a bull market
5314 2018-05-27 04:49:35 Ban bump stocks!

5316 2018-05-27 04:46:52 All weapons should be banned. At the very least, bump stocks.

5320 2018-05-27 04:42:57 Bump-stocks after some practice, creates the same amount of death & carnage as a fully automatic rifle or pistol.
5321 2018-05-27 04:42:55 Banning bump stocks is a first step toward more sensible gun laws, and a move that would make us all safer.
5322 2018-05-27 04:42:44 Well if you are so sure semi auto firearms will be banned, then why would you need to ban bump stocks? Nobody even really cares about bump stocks anyway, no accuracy, just a messy spray of jibberish.
5323 2018-05-27 04:42:11 It’s “bear” arms and it reads “A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.” Bump Stocks are neither “allowed” nor are they prohibited.
5324 2018-05-27 04:41:06 "He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;" ~Proverbs 7:22 #Jesus #God #Bible
5325 2018-05-27 04:38:58 In which the CEO of one of the most shorted stocks in all history tells someone else the public doesn’t trust “you.”
5326 2018-05-27 04:37:06 54% of Americans own stock - but very few of them live off it (I'm guessing, since 10% of Americans own four fifths of the stocks). 

Significantly, of the S&P 500 companies, something like 30 of them account for half the profits, almost all those w/ monopoly power, IP, or land
5327 2018-05-27 04:36:49 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 250 points after Trump called off the North Korean nuclear summit. The S&P 500 fell 0.9 percent as a continued drop in oil prices and bond yields dragged down energy and financials stocks, respectively.

5334 2018-05-27 04:30:45 2/2 Being able to combo her to death off of 3 combos instead of 4 means you need to dodge less bullets to take stocks. As far as dodging the bullets, I can't help much there since again, few good players available for me.
5335 2018-05-27 04:30:01 Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing #stocks.
5336 2018-05-27 04:28:25 What kind of “civilized” nation won’t do the smallest thing to help save the lives of its own citizens? Banning bump stocks is a small thing. Who are our reps afraid of?
5337 2018-05-27 04:27:30 Because bump stocks destroy the accuracy of the rifle. It's a gimmick, a party trick. I've spoken to numerous Police Snipers, and they all say the same thing, that the Vegas shooter would have killed more WITHOUT a bump stock.

Your mileage may vary.
5338 2018-05-27 04:27:17 It did not send my stocks down..
5339 2018-05-27 04:26:42 Avec la position du vix actuel, on dirait en effet qu un gros mouvement s'en vient , vix up stocks down

5342 2018-05-27 04:23:40 Other than Vegas, when have bump stocks been used in shootings? Don't forget that bump firing can be accomplished without a bump stock.
5343 2018-05-27 04:20:53 Bump stocks allow mass murder at a rate never envisioned by our Founding Fathers.
5344 2018-05-27 04:20:00 Bump stocks have no place in our society!
5345 2018-05-27 04:19:42 An AR15 is not a weapon of war. Its a semi-automatic rifle that is the same as my rifle I use to hunt. What needs to be taken away is bump stocks and magazines that hold more than 5 rounds.
5346 2018-05-27 04:19:40 Banning bump stocks won't do anything.  It is a recoil trick.  You can turn a semi auto to full with your belt loop if you want.
5347 2018-05-27 04:19:19 ban bump stocks.
5348 2018-05-27 04:18:51 Ban bump stocks

Thanks
Doug Nearing
5352 2018-05-27 04:15:01 my theory is its because grocery stores genuinely do have large back stocks of items and so people got used to asking for things at the grocers and think it's applicable to all retail. i get at least 5 "do you have any more (x)"s per shift
5353 2018-05-27 04:12:31 BAN BUMP STOCKS NOW! please
5354 2018-05-27 04:11:26 I could show you charts of job grow and stock market numbers under Obama, but I bet you would call them fake.

5359 2018-05-27 04:06:57 Sorry for the inconvenience caused. We are constantly working towards bringing more and more stocks for our users. Rest assured, we will make positive progress and get this sorted at the earliest.
5360 2018-05-27 04:06:48 Please ban bump stocks! It’s frankly a total outrage that they were ever legal.
5361 2018-05-27 04:06:00 You believe in dragging things Mr PC. Stock mkts were dragged up/down several times due to your comments as a Union FM during UPA and son Karti was trading in the stocks & futs in southern region of India.
#Now you are dragging the Modi govt. What's the plan you hv in your mind?
5362 2018-05-27 04:05:49 He did act. The EO banning bump stocks stipulates a 90-day comment period (ending June 23) before going into effect. You have 4 more weeks to whine to the gullible.
5363 2018-05-27 04:04:27 I’m with you. Ban bump stocks, assault weapons, large capacity  magazines.

2) Check Current Prices, for Stocks & Indexes close to Pre-planned Trade Setups. 
3) Look for Possible Inside-Gaps Down & Outside-Gaps up.
4) Check Prices for Longterm Setups.

5382 2018-05-27 03:49:11 Many Indian stock brokers are trying the same old strategies shown in #wolfofwallstreet to convince people to buy penny stocks. The new strategy should focus on being ethical and trying to win customers' trust for the business to florish
5383 2018-05-27 03:47:40 First you want common sense gun laws and now you want them banned. I guarantee you Americans aren’t going to give up their guns as easily. Heck, NJ banned bump stocks and there were ZERO turned in. There are way too many guns out there that aren’t being tracked.

5397 2018-05-27 03:39:09 I think they have banned Bump stocks but we're still waiting on the rest
5398 2018-05-27 03:37:29 And the RIGHT DOESNT? U were being thoughtful and intelligent, now u just sound like a political hack w/ stocks in the AR15 gun manufacturers.

5416 2018-05-27 03:26:22 @realDonaldTrump The van has to be on more than just bumpstocks. It has to be on any device that makes a semi fire *as if* it were fully automatic. That is the loophole that allowed for Bump Stocks.
5417 2018-05-27 03:25:43 Completely believeable. Short vix- long calls .. or long calls against short higher strike calls to clients, or long stocks and noting the fed isn’t supplying spy puts lately.. or some other non speculative hedge on back of clients.

5424 2018-05-27 03:22:09 I am adamantly against everything you stand for... except for this.  There is no need for bump stocks to be sold to make LEGAL weapons into ILLEGAL ones.  Any device that makes something LEGAL into something ILLEGAL should be outlawed.

5446 2018-05-27 03:09:32 Yeah mostly. I will be getting back into penny stocks. Just been crazy busy when the market is open. And when you trade penny stocks you have to be active during trading hours

5449 2018-05-27 03:07:32 If you can find a true legal analysis that allows the ATF to ban bump stocks absent new legislation, I am sure it would be widely and thoroughly ridiculed by real lawyers.  But go ahead and tell your lies

5454 2018-05-27 03:04:09 Earlier today @KyleKashuv and I shared with you a document about bump stocks being bumped. They are now classified as a machine gun effectively banning them.
5455 2018-05-27 03:03:54 How many stock trades do you do just before a bill passes? I bet you raked it in on the healthcare stocks after ACA passed. And how did you and hubs make millions in one yr after your 2009 trip to China?

5466 2018-05-27 02:58:32 Bump stocks should be banned, only killers require them ,

5483 2018-05-27 02:51:33 If automatic weapons are banned so should bump stocks. Close the loophole!
5484 2018-05-27 02:51:24 Bump stocks? Word? RT @realDonaldTrump: I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!

5490 2018-05-27 02:49:34 Please ban bumper stocks.  Civilians do not need these death machines.
5491 2018-05-27 02:49:26 Yet he did nothing.  Talk and more talk.  Under his admin he allowed bump stocks.
5492 2018-05-27 02:49:16 Please use common sense and ban bump stocks!!
5493 2018-05-27 02:49:04 Ban bump stocks.

5504 2018-05-27 02:43:33 state of NJ banned bump stocks on April 15th. 5,000 bump stocks in NJ. How many do you think have been turned in?
5505 2018-05-27 02:42:59 The more $ you have, the more you can push the price action of stocks in your favor just by buying/selling. The 1% only get richer and richer because they literally control the direction of the markets.

5509 2018-05-27 02:41:38 Was this response to my tweet? My tweet is in response to the person saying it was a lie that bump stocks have never been used in a crime.
5510 2018-05-27 02:41:11 trump said this 2/22/18-I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope! .@realDonaldTrump
5511 2018-05-27 02:40:50 We need to ban Bump Stocks once and for all!! Save lives!!!
5512 2018-05-27 02:40:47 Ok let’s rephrase....he likes bump stocks enough to ignore that they are tools used to slaughter dozens of people in a matter of seconds
5513 2018-05-27 02:40:43 Bump stocks currently sold it still in stores are not banned & while REPUBLICANS are in office never will. However the creator of bump stocks has ceased all manufacturing & sales.
5514 2018-05-27 02:38:39 Ban bump stocks!
5515 2018-05-27 02:38:32 Common sense.  Ban bump stocks.
5516 2018-05-27 02:38:16 Obviously ban bump stocks
5517 2018-05-27 02:36:58  ban bump stocks
5518 2018-05-27 02:36:41 We not only need to ban bump stocks, but the assault rifle ban should be put back into law. @SteveSchmidtSES @realDonaldTrump @RWPUSA
5519 2018-05-27 02:36:20 Nope, this is good/great news for those that understand what it means. 
5520 2018-05-27 02:36:10 There is simply no reason that any civilian would need to create a fully automatic weapon. Period. This does not need to be engaged as if bump stocks were a serious position.
5521 2018-05-27 02:35:48 No bump stocks!
5522 2018-05-27 02:35:00 Yes, bump stocks should be banned. #BanBumpStocks
5523 2018-05-27 02:34:18 It is a no brainer to ban bump stocks.  They are not needed outside the military.  Innocent American lives are more important than the gun industry’s profit margins.
5524 2018-05-27 02:34:08 Are these something to be weary of?
5525 2018-05-27 02:33:57 We need to ban bump stocks immediately. #BanBumpStocks
5526 2018-05-27 02:33:56 The gist of New Alpine Dilution Rules: We R only able to allow up to 20% of the 20-day average daily volume of the particular stock you’d like 2 sell over a 2 day span.  OTC market is seeing traders Buying and Holding stocks again.  So,Big Middle Finger to the Toxic Debt Holders!
5527 2018-05-27 02:33:52 Please throw my support for banning bump stocks
5528 2018-05-27 02:33:35 Dear Democrats and Republicans ban bump stocks and most guns
5529 2018-05-27 02:33:12 Banning bump stocks is a no brainer. I’m with you, David.
5530 2018-05-27 02:32:22 did you know at 0%, fresh stomp will knock fox down? but if its staled one point when he tries to do that in the later stocks then itll crumple them if they're grounded and you can get a free grab after
5531 2018-05-27 02:31:56 President Trump already instructed DoJ to ban Bump Stocks. On March 24, 2018 DOJ sent proposed Rule to Federal Register for 90 day commitment period before it goes into effect. Hogg needs to learn how grown up things work. He's a one trick pony.
5532 2018-05-27 02:31:03 The benefits of bump stocks do not outweigh its consequences. Pls ban them
5533 2018-05-27 02:30:33 *To preserve your bump stocks
5534 2018-05-27 02:30:23 Improve NICS database, licence for concealed carry, mental health agree on all of that. Bump stocks are basically a moot point, the only manufact closed up. I would like current laws enforced like straw purchases, no plea bargains on crimes with guns, sweep the inner cities.
5535 2018-05-27 02:30:11 Nope.  He likes bump stocks more than kids.
5536 2018-05-27 02:29:20 Stay strong David...Ban bump stocks
5537 2018-05-27 02:28:16 Ban bump stocks.
5538 2018-05-27 02:28:07 This is regarding Alpine stocks, which really has been 1 of our main culprits in ruining our plays.  Again, anyone smarter than me is welcome to chime in and educate
5539 2018-05-27 02:27:58 We are talking about mass shootings. We are talking about bump stocks. Over half of mass shooters were killed on scene with the MAJORITY killing themselves. Others were arrested and taken alive.
5540 2018-05-27 02:27:24 Please ban bump stocks!
5541 2018-05-27 02:27:23 Ban bump stocks now! They are made for one thing and that’s killing people!
5542 2018-05-27 02:26:56 Ban bump stocks
5543 2018-05-27 02:25:52 We demand a ban on bump stocks!!! #GunReformNow
5544 2018-05-27 02:25:11 Ban bump stocks. And then keep going.
5545 2018-05-27 02:24:49 SHARE OF STOCKS!  GANERN!!
5546 2018-05-27 02:24:22 Try reading Conservative legal opinions that state the 2nd amendment does NOT entitle anyone to bump stocks, AR-15s, and similar weapons. Most Americans think sensible background checks are reasonable and right. No one is trying to take away your guns, children. GROW UP!
5547 2018-05-27 02:22:49 There is no beneficial use for bump stocks unless you are in a war#BanBumpStocks
5548 2018-05-27 02:22:04 Ban bump stocks now!
5549 2018-05-27 02:21:29 Ban bump stocks. Ban guns.
5550 2018-05-27 02:21:14 Done. Here’s mine.  Ban bump stocks. No more debate.
5551 2018-05-27 02:20:01 We can do anything if we stay united, including banning bump stocks
5552 2018-05-27 02:19:59 Bump stocks=more mass murder.
5553 2018-05-27 02:19:56 Nor have bump stocks been used in any crime.  If u have any knowledge of firearms  then u will know that the horrible crime that was commited in vegas was not commited using bump stocks.  They were fully automatic weapons.   Bump stocks dont fire like that
5554 2018-05-27 02:19:31 #BanBumpStocks. Absolutely no reason for bump stocks unless your a mass shooter of human beings.
5555 2018-05-27 02:19:29 My family is at the table talking about loans and stocks and I've never been so sure I'm not an adult....
5556 2018-05-27 02:18:06 No more bump stocks
5557 2018-05-27 02:18:06 no, you're mistaken. Nations DO NOT make war, it's the moneyed interests that wage war. I don't, and you don't wage war, and congress has abdicated their duty in Article 1 Section 8, it's corporations that wage war. Every missile dropped look at Raytheon & Lockheed Martin stocks.
5558 2018-05-27 02:17:25 Please ban bump stocks!
5559 2018-05-27 02:16:41 I’m in!...
There is absolutely no reason for bump stocks  to exist, except for giddy gun owners to jerk off over!...
I’m not against responsible gun ownership,,, but,,, exactly what purpose do these products serve?... 
Certainly not hunting!...

5563 2018-05-27 02:14:28 There is no good purpose for them, we need a ban on bump stocks.

5571 2018-05-27 02:12:54 Just saw a stock I loved and bought at 10 and sold at 40 a couple years ago when I got out of stocks is now at 100.

My night/week/life is ruined.
5572 2018-05-27 02:12:49 Ban bump stocks and all weapons of war.
5573 2018-05-27 02:12:27 Care to remind everyone whose regime made bump stocks legal in the first place? 

Spoiler alert - I refer to them as "Obama stocks" in his honor.

And just like the rest of the legacy of the #SmoothCriminal, President Trump will erase that as well...
5574 2018-05-27 02:12:14 Anything that makes a gun rapid fire has no place in a civilized society  Ban bump stocks now.
5575 2018-05-27 02:11:56 Except that those shareholders also include middle class folks who have invested in stocks
5576 2018-05-27 02:11:28 Ban bump stocks now!
5577 2018-05-27 02:11:25 Ban bump stocks and assault weapons.  I assert my right to live and pursue happiness.
5578 2018-05-27 02:10:34 We absolutely need to ban bump stocks. This is a gun accessory that no one needs to have.

5585 2018-05-27 02:07:35 For god's sake, ban bump stocks already!
5586 2018-05-27 02:07:22 And Obama approved the sale of bump stocks two different times and the NRA said for the ATF two look into and see if they were in conflict with the law,so don't talk and you won't sound stupid
5587 2018-05-27 02:07:12 There is no legitimate reason for a gun owner to have bump stocks. #BanBumpStocks
5588 2018-05-27 02:06:54 If your still ignorant enough to the think that it was bump stocks that the guy used in vegas then your knowledge of guns is limited.  Those were full automatic weapons.  The type that are already illegal to the average citizen

5605 2018-05-27 02:00:07 Bump stocks don't belong on the shelves of gun stores, not do they belong at a gun show!
5606 2018-05-27 01:58:29 Outlaw bump Stocks!
5607 2018-05-27 01:57:39 Ban bump stocks, ban military style weapons from the public.
5608 2018-05-27 01:57:21 BAN bump stocks now!
5609 2018-05-27 01:56:33 Ban bump stocks now
5610 2018-05-27 01:56:28 We must ban bump stocks - also time to end NRA’s stranglehold on our political institutions!
5611 2018-05-27 01:56:24 Saying the same WRONG thing over and over doesn't EVER make it RIGHT.

Trump does NOT have the power to unilaterally ban bump stocks via executive order (no matter what he SAID).

If the Executive Branch DID have that power, Obama would have "banned" everything with a trigger...
5612 2018-05-27 01:55:18 Ban bump stocks. No reason to have them!
5613 2018-05-27 01:54:04 Get rid of bump stocks.  No one needs them.
5614 2018-05-27 01:53:42 There will never be a repeal of 2A.  That's not most people's goal.  Don't care how many laws are on the books....no reason bump stocks should be legal.  Restricting access to some high powered rapidly firing rifles does not go against 2A
5615 2018-05-27 01:52:47 So far, my recommendations on Stocks has given nothing but a good profits for my followers. And, i’d like to keep it that way.
Stay humble, stay calm, and good things will happen for sure!.
5616 2018-05-27 01:51:39 Absolutely ban bump stocks.
5617 2018-05-27 01:51:30 I have proudly submitted my comment on the banning of bump stocks to the ATF.
5618 2018-05-27 01:51:05 Infinite stocks, 99 minutes, forgot to turn pause on
5619 2018-05-27 01:50:59 Start with banning bump stocks. A first step in safe gun reform.
5620 2018-05-27 01:50:47 Ban bump stocks. They have no legitimate purpose.
5621 2018-05-27 01:50:43 PLEASE! Ban bump stocks!!!!
5622 2018-05-27 01:50:42 How many stocks did you start with?
5623 2018-05-27 01:50:30 This is a no-brainer.  Of course bump stocks should be banned.  The majority of the country believes this
5624 2018-05-27 01:49:35 ban bump stocks
5625 2018-05-27 01:49:32 It is only logical to ban bump stocks
5626 2018-05-27 01:49:30 Ban bump stocks and tighten gun regulations!!!
5627 2018-05-27 01:48:25 Actually, that's just a stock phrase / one of the first sentences I learned in hs German. Did I mention I have a photographic memory? :)

Limo is lemonade; idk if Chanda @peddlingplastic stocks that at the bar or not, lol :O
5628 2018-05-27 01:48:09 How can it grow in value?  Doesn’t seem currency should grow or decline like stocks.
5629 2018-05-27 01:47:34 Ban Bump Stocks!
5630 2018-05-27 01:47:23 Wtf..people follow him only to get the info on tesla and the stocks..hehe..
5631 2018-05-27 01:44:37 Bump stocks need to be banned. There is absolutely no good reason for them.
5632 2018-05-27 01:44:25 Let's vote to ban bum stocks
5633 2018-05-27 01:43:31 BAN BUMP STOCKS
5634 2018-05-27 01:43:24 ban bump stocks
5635 2018-05-27 01:43:17 #BanBumpStocks. Nobody needs bump stocks, so why don't we just ban them?
5636 2018-05-27 01:43:01 BAN BUMP STOCKS
5637 2018-05-27 01:43:01 Ban bump stocks now and save the innocent children’s lives who mean you no harm.
5638 2018-05-27 01:42:32 What does DM mean? I guess most other A Stocks have already been scrapped?
5639 2018-05-27 01:41:52 @sniperstube the Government's won't let #Crypto get in the way of stocks and traditional markets. So what I see happen is a cross over between the stock market and crypto. Thoughts?
5640 2018-05-27 01:41:28 Ban bump stocks now.
5641 2018-05-27 01:40:54 Ban bump stocks
5642 2018-05-27 01:40:07 Ban bump stocks now.
5643 2018-05-27 01:39:59 Bump stocks DO NOT convert semiautomatics to automatics. Learn how things work.
5644 2018-05-27 01:39:42 Is a reply the same as a comment? I support a ban on bump stocks. The only practical purpose of a bump stock is to increase casualties, deaths and level of suppression when shooting into a crowd. Why allow accessories to be used for the purpose of mass murder?
5645 2018-05-27 01:39:16 #BanBumpStocks now! Too many people have been killed or injured by the de facto automatic firearms created by bump stocks. #EnoughIsEnough
5646 2018-05-27 01:39:01 Ban all Bump stocks now
5647 2018-05-27 01:38:58 Yes, we need to ban bump stocks.
5648 2018-05-27 01:37:39 Bump stocks should be as plentiful as a truthful statement from drumpf
5649 2018-05-27 01:36:56 Its just a list of what I deem as fundamentally good stocks, most of which are also technically strong. Each tier is a spread of sectors. Thats all.
5650 2018-05-27 01:36:48 #BanBumpStocks now! Too many people have died or been injured by the de facto automatic firearms created by bump stocks. #EnoughIsEnough
5651 2018-05-27 01:36:18 Having a really nice day today. Woke up, had a great workout, got a lot of schoolwork done, took 10 stocks in a crew battle, and now @SugaredPaws is awake to spend the rest of the day with me. Life is good B)
5652 2018-05-27 01:36:15 There's only one reason for bump stocks: and that's KILLING more people faster than you can with a regular assault weapon (which also should be banned BTW). #basta
5653 2018-05-27 01:36:11 Ban the bump stocks!
5654 2018-05-27 01:34:55 Street Stocks on track. IRA called to staging.
5655 2018-05-27 01:34:47 Bump stocks are weapons of mass destruction ban them now.
5656 2018-05-27 01:33:56 Ban bump stocks now
5657 2018-05-27 01:33:07 Ban bump stocks !!
5658 2018-05-27 01:33:01 Ban Bump Stocks!
5659 2018-05-27 01:32:35 No excuse. Ban the bump stocks today!!!
5660 2018-05-27 01:32:31 Yeah of course I diversify my stocks. I diversify somewhat in crypto as well of course. Maybe 8-15 coins, but that doesn’t reduce volatility as much as allow for exposure to different sectors. As you know, stocks are based of economic factors and earnings.
5661 2018-05-27 01:31:33 Bump stocks need to be banned! At least it's a start.
5662 2018-05-27 01:30:06 Woodhull Auto Supply Hobby Stocks (20 laps): TED MORSEMAN 44, Joe Birdsall 63, Les Smith 8x, Carter Dennis 22, AJ Nierdermaier 73
5663 2018-05-27 01:29:45 U leftist brain washed idiot we are all so tired of u and your  group of leftist scumbag swamp cronies that r just using idiots like u trying to disarm the public which is so obvious. By the way I have 10 bump stocks so kiss my a.., o and I bought them legally! U morons ! NRA # 1
5664 2018-05-27 01:29:33 Ban bump stocks will not stop school shootings by itself but it absolutely will reduce casualties! If the killer at Santa Fe could get hold of a semi automatic with bump stock attached, the death toll would have been 3x or 4x higher.
5665 2018-05-27 01:29:12 It's that combo of carrots, celery and onion used for a lot of sauces, stews, stocks, etc. It sort of is like a spell component!
5666 2018-05-27 01:28:07 No me gusta las letras y le faltan varios toques como cc y stocks en partes esenciales 8/10
5667 2018-05-27 01:27:16 Ban the bump stocks!

5669 2018-05-27 01:25:25 With $10,000 and a subscription to #SwingTrader the average person could have made $3,769 from 1/1/18 to 2/1/18 minus 69 for the subscription, that’s 3700 in one month without having to know a thing about trading.... #investing #stocks #IBD #wallstreet #moneytree #tip #takenotes
5670 2018-05-27 01:25:24 Ban bump stocks now!
5671 2018-05-27 01:25:09 I sent a comment. It only takes a few minutes to weigh in. I’d recommend saying something like “ban bump stocks AND similar devices.”
5672 2018-05-27 01:25:06 Please please ban bump stocks. It is a no brainer.
5673 2018-05-27 01:24:19 Ban bump stocks. There is no good reason to continue to allow them.
5674 2018-05-27 01:23:54 Bam bump stocks. Thank you, David.
5675 2018-05-27 01:23:17 if you took drama off the field friday then you’re childish. it was never that serious.
5676 2018-05-27 01:23:07 Legends on track now for their 20 lap A-Main. Street Stocks up next with another 20 laps and then the IRA for 30 laps.
5677 2018-05-27 01:22:47 Ban Bump Stocks

5680 2018-05-27 01:21:59 Ban Bump Stocks
5681 2018-05-27 01:21:00 Lowkey wish I brought more stocks instead of going a trip but u gotta live sometimes
5682 2018-05-27 01:20:12 How do you get the very good HD stocks? They are crystal clear and look very realistic. Good work
5683 2018-05-27 01:19:58 Ban bump stocks
5684 2018-05-27 01:19:49 الرياض
5685 2018-05-27 01:19:15 Winners so far at #elkospeedway Chad Walen in Late Models, Eric Campbell in Thunder Cars, Joey Prusak in Power Stocks.  #NASCAR #RACING
5686 2018-05-27 01:19:05 I support a ban on bump stocks.
5687 2018-05-27 01:18:51 Thanks for everything you do, David. Bump stocks should definitely be banned. #BanBumpStocks
5688 2018-05-27 01:18:22 Yesss! We need to ban bump stocks
5689 2018-05-27 01:18:17 Trump already signed an order to ban bump stocks, dumb ass. Nice try.
5690 2018-05-27 01:18:01 Why on earth has this taken so long? Ban bump stocks
5691 2018-05-27 01:17:45 Tim Sykes should be in jail. Since it is obvious he has his kroy Michaud and other thugs shortin stocks syndicate causing some drop.  They pander righteous ground and blame promoters when they profit from them. Don’t think Tim sleeps well.
5692 2018-05-27 01:17:43 Ban bump stocks.  Save lives
5693 2018-05-27 01:17:41 Well, that Obama brought us out of a recession and brought down unemployment rate over 5%, I am sure he did for himself. Saved America’s car companies from bankruptcies, steady incline of stocks. Yeah, he really did bad!
5694 2018-05-27 01:17:07 Ban bump stocks NOW!
5695 2018-05-27 01:16:54 BAN BUMP STOCKS                           That’s just for starters
5696 2018-05-27 01:16:41 WR: Hobby Stocks- Teddy Morseman wins over Joe Birdsall and Les Smith @WoodhullPR
5697 2018-05-27 01:16:40 Looks like it'll end up as a set of frying pans now  Were any of the A Stocks preserved for the LTM/Acton depot?
5698 2018-05-27 01:16:33 BUMP STOCKS SHOULD ALREAD BE ILLEGAL. THE FIREARMS LAWS DO NOT ALLOW ANY GUN TO FIRE FULL AUTOMATIC UNLESS SPECIAL LICENSE IS SECURED. THE BUMP STOCK "MAKES" A SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPON FIRE FULL AUTOMATIC. ENFORCE THE DAMNED LAW...IT IS "NOT" FIFTY SHADES OF GREY. IT'S BLACK & WHITE
5699 2018-05-27 01:16:22 Ban them now!  Bo more bump stocks
5700 2018-05-27 01:15:11 You can’t get shot by a bump stock. Bump stocks do not hold bullets. Hell, they’re not even made of metal. They are not covered by the second amendment.
5701 2018-05-27 01:15:07 Ban bump stocks
5702 2018-05-27 01:13:50 Hoping most people agree that we don't need access to kill the most people in the least amount of time.  Ban bump stocks.
5703 2018-05-27 01:13:00 Ban bump stocks.
5704 2018-05-27 01:12:05 Ban bump stocks
5705 2018-05-27 01:11:36 Why not ban bump stocks? Give me one good reason, besides your bottom line.
5706 2018-05-27 01:11:25 Ban bump stocks. If the gov can require that we wear seat belts to make it safer and less impactful for everyone, then we can ban bump stocks as well.
5707 2018-05-27 01:11:15 RT @HisLittleRara: #Storyin12 He came over to help install the new stocks for my dungeon.
5708 2018-05-27 01:10:35 More like my retirement that is invested in stocks for these profitable companies
5709 2018-05-27 01:10:33 How far will #Netflix stocks drop after Obama is impeached and thrown in jail? Risky move by netflix.
5710 2018-05-27 01:10:15  Ban bump stocks 
5711 2018-05-27 01:09:51 Bump stocks enable an insane level of aggressive human-hunting. I have not heard one soldier speak in favor of them. Soldiers see ZERO purpose for their existence.
5712 2018-05-27 01:09:43 No need for bump stocks. None at all. Ban em!
5713 2018-05-27 01:09:14 Bump stocks are unnecessary and lethal. Ban them now!! There were no bump stocks when the Second Amendment was written and anyone who thinks that there were needs to read up on the topic.
5714 2018-05-27 01:08:01 Ban bump stocks!
5715 2018-05-27 01:07:49 Ban bump stocks!
5716 2018-05-27 01:07:40 Ban the bump stocks there is no legitimate reason for them...
5717 2018-05-27 01:07:29 Ban bump stocks
5718 2018-05-27 01:07:05 Bump stocks should be banned.
5719 2018-05-27 01:06:58 Ban bump stocks
5720 2018-05-27 01:06:47 Confused by your own statement compairing bump stocks to hand grenades. I merely was pointing out one is expolsive the other is attached to firearm . One is legal according to ATF the other is heavily controled item .
5721 2018-05-27 01:06:41 My dad just read me for filth for not investing in stocks.
5722 2018-05-27 01:06:34 No reason in the world to sell or own bump stocks!!!
5723 2018-05-27 01:06:23 Unlike the other tech giants, he is the product.  All of his projects funding come with a maybe when it comes to market control.   A lack of confidence in him and the stocks will drop and funding will dry up.
5724 2018-05-27 01:06:20 Not physically, but their political reach has stopped even the most common sense laws from being passed.  Because if the NRA, bump stocks have been legal.  Then Las Vegas happened.  Instead of over 50 people dying, could have been a lot less
5725 2018-05-27 01:06:07 Ban bump stocks and assault rifles for good...and classify AR-15s as assault rifles
5726 2018-05-27 01:05:59 Find someone to build with then Conquer the World and Eviscerate your enemies #Crypto #Stocks #Gains — feeling pumped
5727 2018-05-27 01:05:35 Bump stocks have nothing to do with Constitutional Rights.  They are a device that needs to be banned. Stop the killing.  #BanBumpStocks
5728 2018-05-27 01:04:43 Upon further research, it sounds as though it was opposed due to being overreaching. The bill didn't specifically name bump stocks, but any part that could be used to increase firing speeds even if it doesn't convert it to a machine gun.
5729 2018-05-27 01:03:53 Bump stocks cause an increase in fatalities. There was a shooting in Las Vegas you see... oh never mind.
5730 2018-05-27 01:03:19 Ban jump stocks!
5731 2018-05-27 01:03:08 The young people will save us. Ban bump stocks.
5732 2018-05-27 01:02:47 Of course we need to ban bump stocks.
5733 2018-05-27 01:02:40 watch me get rich off stocks takes money to make money 
5734 2018-05-27 01:02:24 Bump stocks have no place in a civilized society. If you consider yourself a skilled hunter, then using a bump stock on any gun belies your boast or affirmation of your skill level; you are nothing more than a fraud like the US president.
5735 2018-05-27 01:02:15 Please BAN BUMP STOCKS. We should not be making mass murder EASIER
5736 2018-05-27 01:02:01 I don't want bump stocks banned.  In fact I don't believe fully automatics should be banned.  I'm simply pointing out that the bump stock is a toy.  You disagree?
5737 2018-05-27 01:01:53 Are bump stocks guns? They’re not even made of metal. Can I get shot by a bump stock?
5738 2018-05-27 01:01:19 Ban bump stocks!!!
5739 2018-05-27 01:01:07 Please ban Bump Stocks!!!
5740 2018-05-27 01:01:07 Ban bump up stocks!
5741 2018-05-27 01:00:45 Not quite because if marth isn't getting tippers consistently, he's a bad character imo. Bad damage/knockback will make it really hard to close out stocks
5742 2018-05-27 01:00:28 BAN BUMP STOCKS!
5743 2018-05-27 01:00:26 Bump stocks need to be banned, the only thing they were intended for is killing! Stop this madness now!
5744 2018-05-27 01:00:02 There are a lot of different types of algorithmic trading styles. Super active intraday trading with volatile stocks, long and short ETF pair, indicator-based portfolio allocation, long-short in daily timeframe, machine learning approach, and more.  What is your style?
5745 2018-05-27 00:59:33 Ban those bump stocks. From Nevada.
5746 2018-05-27 00:59:28 Ban bump stocks and all assault weapons now!
5747 2018-05-27 00:59:25 You’ve got my support. Let’s get those bump stocks banned.
5748 2018-05-27 00:58:56 Ban bump stocks
5749 2018-05-27 00:58:53 it should happen sometime next week depending on how fast otcmarkets work
5750 2018-05-27 00:58:47 BAN BUMP STOCKS NOW.  ENOUGH KILLINGS.  THIS IS A SIMPLE EFFECTIVE STEP TO TAKE
5751 2018-05-27 00:58:18 Ban bump stocks.  Ban guns!
5752 2018-05-27 00:57:31 Ban bump stocks. It’s not a 2nd amendment right.
5753 2018-05-27 00:55:54 Yes of course we must ban bump stocks
5754 2018-05-27 00:55:51 Ban Bump Stocks!
5755 2018-05-27 00:55:29 1 more here... bump stocks need to go.

5761 2018-05-27 00:51:55 My state is working on it even if they won’t on a Federal level Starting July 1, the bill would make it illegal for anyone in Washington to manufacture or sell bump stocks. Then, in July 2019, it would become illegal to own or possess a bump stock in the state.
5762 2018-05-27 00:51:33 No "constitutional rights" to bump stocks. 2nd amendment is for a "well-regulated militia". #BanBumpStocks
5763 2018-05-27 00:50:51 Please ban bump stocks!
5764 2018-05-27 00:50:46 Perhaps if you had the effort in you to understand what we want. We do not want to take any guns away from you that you already have. We want to ban bump stocks and weapons of war. Even an NRA idiot said that AR 15 AK 15 whatever the fuck it is was only for target practice.
5765 2018-05-27 00:50:09 Please ban bump stocks.
5766 2018-05-27 00:50:06 There is no place in civilized society for bump stocks.
5767 2018-05-27 00:49:41 Not sure if I already commented but I definitely want a ban on at least bump stocks!
5768 2018-05-27 00:49:03 There is no legitimate reason at all why these are commercially available.  Banning bump stocks should be a no-brainer in any rational society.
5769 2018-05-27 00:48:40 Bump stocks should be banned! #BanBumpStocks
5770 2018-05-27 00:48:28 Ban bump stocks!

5774 2018-05-27 00:47:41 People will go $100,000 in debt for college but won’t invest $5,000 in a stock because it’s too ‘risky’. #stocks
5775 2018-05-27 00:47:27 Springs aren't allowed in bump stocks. Original model had them, they were removed after BATFE defined the devices as "conversions" because of the mechanical assist. Redesign and now legal. I love people who say "serious shooter" and they want to restrict peoples rights.
5776 2018-05-27 00:47:11 We MUST ban bump stocks! There is no need for them in our democratic society.
5777 2018-05-27 00:46:22 I would like bump stocks banned.

5782 2018-05-27 00:44:14 Agreed. No more bump stocks.
5783 2018-05-27 00:44:07 RT SJosephBurns "SatoshiFlipper CryptoHustle It depends on their goals. My point is the importance of investments in stocks not just investing in education. Opening their mind."
5784 2018-05-27 00:44:04 Has LVPD, or any other agency confirmed, on the record & citing ballistic rifling evidence, that either of the two (or possibly more) weapons photographed in the room modified with "bump stocks" were actually used in the commission of the crime?
5785 2018-05-27 00:43:46 What is the probability of getting quality stocks cheap in general?
5786 2018-05-27 00:43:15 It depends on their goals. My point is the importance of investments in stocks not just investing in education. Opening their mind.
5787 2018-05-27 00:43:04 Most named varietal fruit trees are grown by grafting branches of the fruiting variety onto root-stocks from varieties that are disease resistant but maybe less tasty.  If you buy the same variety at your new location you are growing a different branch from the same tree. A clone
5788 2018-05-27 00:42:27 Ban bump stocks pls
5789 2018-05-27 00:42:08 I’m kinda neutral on the bump stock thing But that guy using bump stocks probably saved a lot of lives. I’ll explain. With the weapons he had and at the range he was at, he would’ve killed more people if he would’ve taken the  time to Aim properly instead of spray and pray, imho.
5790 2018-05-27 00:42:01 should kids forego an education and trade stocks instead?
5791 2018-05-27 00:41:56 Ban bump stocks!
5792 2018-05-27 00:41:20 Ban bump stocks!!!
5793 2018-05-27 00:41:10 What's an appropo response other than FFS BAN BUMP STOCKS!?!
5794 2018-05-27 00:40:57 Ban bumb stocks!
5795 2018-05-27 00:40:35 Ban bump stocks!!!
5796 2018-05-27 00:40:21 There is no reason for bump stocks. Except killing people or larping at a shooting range.
5797 2018-05-27 00:40:05 You are an investor. 

You may not invest with your money, but you invest energy and time in people.

But just like with stocks, most people are ignorant of investing principles.
5798 2018-05-27 00:39:59 I don’t usually get political here or pick a side. I have my beliefs and they are personal. I respect all of yours except one. Wheat tortillas need to be banned. (Low carb wheat are the bump stocks of tortillas) No argument. You feel different you’re wrong. #WheatTortillas
5799 2018-05-27 00:39:46 Ban bump stocks at the very least. #banbumpstocks
5800 2018-05-27 00:39:22 I think you HAVE to be invested in equities BUT you should be tactical.  Take a 60/40. If you don’t like stocks or bonds take a position in ALTS (20%), and create a 50/30/20.  Don’t be fully invested in stocks at all time highs BUT don’t sit in cash cause valuations high!
5801 2018-05-27 00:39:19 Ban bump stocks!
5802 2018-05-27 00:38:45 Ban bump stocks and save lives!
5803 2018-05-27 00:38:23 Ban bump stocks!
5804 2018-05-27 00:37:36 Bump stocks are a joke. They are pretty much useless, they are a novelty. Banning them has zero value from a safety point of view, erodes our freedoms, and creates still more regulations for the TLAs to enforce.
5805 2018-05-27 00:37:25 Sarin is already illegal for every nation and citizen in world yet it KEEPS making the news as being used to murder civilians.  Bump stocks are legal and have been used once in a crime with no deaths directly attributed to them.  So ... ban bump stocks because why again?
5806 2018-05-27 00:37:12 Stunning.
But go back before the Great Depression.
You will see the same.
Long term, stocks go up.
5807 2018-05-27 00:37:03 I thought Donald trump promised to ban bump stocks already
He lied?
I’m shocked
(Sarcasm)
Let’s get it done!
5808 2018-05-27 00:37:03 Bump stocks must be criminalized n no longer accessible!

1. How to fish for active stocks.
2. Determine when breakout is about to happen.
3. Create a trading plan system.
5812 2018-05-27 00:34:32 Bump stocks are an easy way to turn a weapon of murder into a weapon of mass murder. They have no place in any civilized society.
5813 2018-05-27 00:34:01 Bump Stocks have only one use that I can see.
Given guns are made to kill.
A Bump Stock ensures quick Multiple Kills.
5814 2018-05-27 00:33:34 Ban bump stocks
5815 2018-05-27 00:33:23 Ban bump stocks now!! There Is no need for anyone to own them
5816 2018-05-27 00:33:17 It's diversification within a sector/industry. Stocks are also fairly correlated with one another, but it's still recommended to hold a diversified portfolio of stocks
5817 2018-05-27 00:32:52 Its about time to take things more seriously. Because I am damn serious about financial freedom. #IT #stocks #bilingual
5818 2018-05-27 00:32:52 Ban bump stocks now!!!
5819 2018-05-27 00:32:26 Bump stocks serve no useful purpose, please ban them. Congress do your job!
5820 2018-05-27 00:31:58 Absolutely NO ONE has any need for an automated human killing machine outside a military war situation.  Ban bump stocks and military style weapons NOW to lower the gun violence death toll.
5821 2018-05-27 00:31:11 Bevy24: Only the military and police officers should have access to assault rifles and bump stocks.  Ban them now from the general puplic.

5825 2018-05-27 00:29:57 Ban Bump Stocks!
5826 2018-05-27 00:29:48 Bump stocks didn't kill any of the kids at MSDHS, or any other school shooting.
5827 2018-05-27 00:29:19 It's almost 8 months since bump stocks enabled the Las Vegas mass murderer to   kill over 50 people and injure  more than 500, and still Congess has not acted.
5828 2018-05-27 00:29:15 As long as you bought and own them legally, store them safely, and use them lawfully, there's no chance anyone's gonna ask you to turn them in. Bump stocks are NOT guns, they're accessories used by mass murderers and inept "hunters". 1/2
5829 2018-05-27 00:29:13 Ban bump stocks #BanBumpStocks.  Keep up the great work David.  You are making a difference!

5857 2018-05-27 00:22:12 Ah yes, Bernie apologists always find excuses for his shit votes.
What explains his vote to dump toxic waste in a latino community and him and Jane having stocks in the firm that was gonna do it?
Or him voting to protect private militias shooting at immigrants?

5882 2018-05-27 00:16:13 Why would bump stocks be legal in a civilized society? #BanBumpStocks
5883 2018-05-27 00:15:57 Ban Bump stocks. This is the minimum we should do. All weapons of war should be banned from the civilian population.
5884 2018-05-27 00:15:21 Ban bump stocks!
5885 2018-05-27 00:15:13 Please ban bump stocks.

5889 2018-05-27 00:14:04 As @DVAAus legislation stands, regarding payments for injuries, it might be worth buying some stocks in the company that harmed you. The way the government is acting it might be the only chance of any kind of payments.
But then again. My money is on a conviction at lower levels.
5890 2018-05-27 00:13:59 There is no need for bump stocks. They serve no purpose, except to kill. #BanBumpStocks

For a man that was directly linked to so many controversies it isn't surprising that it all comes up again years later.

5905 2018-05-27 00:07:55 So why are bump stocks necessary?
5906 2018-05-27 00:07:06 Ban Bump Stocks
5907 2018-05-27 00:07:01 I am certain banning bump stocks won’t solve the problem... but one less expediter of death is fine by me.
Ban Bump Stocks
5908 2018-05-27 00:06:54 Yes we should ban bump stocks.

5913 2018-05-27 00:05:08 Nobody needs bump stocks
5914 2018-05-27 00:05:03 Not to mention this assumes you only invest in one geographic segment (U.S.) of one sub-segment (large cap stocks) of one asset class (equities). Highly doubt any advisor is telling clients to put it all on red.
5915 2018-05-27 00:04:53 Protect our citizens! Ban bump stocks. There are only megative consequences.
5916 2018-05-27 00:04:24 Semi automatic are not assault weapons. By definition, it’s impossible. To be an assault rifle the rifle must have select fire, aka machine guns.  Bump stocks are dumb, bump stock bans even more so. You can bump fire using your finger. Ban those next?
5917 2018-05-27 00:03:49 Banning bumps stocks seems like a no brainer...but then NRA nutters would need a brain to get that wouldn't they!?
5918 2018-05-27 00:03:05 Please ban bump stocks and All devices that convert weapons to automatic.
5919 2018-05-27 00:02:34 Ban bump stocks
5920 2018-05-27 00:02:12 bump stocks and AR-15s are for hunting... men, women, and children.  BAN THEM NOW!
5921 2018-05-27 00:02:08 Ban bump stocks
5922 2018-05-27 00:02:02 Agreed.  Bump stocks are merely a means to circumvent law.  Get rid of them.
5923 2018-05-27 00:01:53 Ban Bump Stocks
5924 2018-05-27 00:01:53 Ban bump stocks and Nazis.
5925 2018-05-27 00:01:47 Agreed

But the fallacious element is the anaology with stocks and reasoning behind the "50/70 bets", not the number of bags per se
5926 2018-05-27 00:00:50 The part about goverment interference causing market collapse? Please, do tell me how the government caused the overvaluing of stocks that caused the Great Depression, while you are at it, tell me how they caused the housing bubble.
5927 2018-05-27 00:00:45 Yes, we must ban bump stocks
5928 2018-05-27 00:00:33 Ban bump stocks and assualt weapons.
5929 2018-05-27 00:00:00 I 100% support gun laws reform, including the ban of bump stocks!
