40 2018-03-05 22:34:33 The sad truth is that #NFL players are not treated as human beings but rather disposable commodities. Once that player can no longer drive TV ratings or sell game merch, pizzas, insurance or any other product, they are expendable.

102 2018-03-05 18:41:58 In fact there is a remarkable resemblance between 2015 and today in terms of hedge fund positioning in commodities. Oil, Gold, Copper, Gasoline all have immensely one sided speculative (85%+ long) positioning.
103 2018-03-05 18:41:08 I'm not bullish or bearish. The macro data from Asia is not beating the bar being set.  In fact last time we saw macro asian data coming in below estimates was 3 months before 2015. when we saw oversupply in commodities and deflation ensued.

105 2018-03-05 18:39:13 Agree. China slowdown is the biggest risk.

However, there may be a silver lining - those commodities which are heavily polluting & china is shutting their production because of "blue skies" campaign, might see lesser impact

Also, consumer themes will be less impacted - rice etc
106 2018-03-05 18:21:41 I agree price of both milk & meat should reflect it’s value & cost. We should utterly respect these products, not treat them as commodities.

113 2018-03-05 17:51:28 Loyalty! It’s one of the most precious commodities of our social lives.
114 2018-03-05 17:48:56 The candidate you supported (Hillary) touted Gramm-Leach-Billy, Commodities Futures modernization act, telecommunications act of 96, Wellfare reform of 96, NAFTA, CTPA, TPP, TiSA,  and charter schools.
115 2018-03-05 17:47:07 I really object to your business. People are treating babies as if they are commodities.

No one has a 'right' to a baby.
116 2018-03-05 17:34:41 Not to mention OHSAS 18001 . Many UK businesses <particularly manufacturing, engineering and commodities supply> need this certification, together with ISO 9001 + ISO 14001. Many customers insist compliance of these standards before they will do business!
117 2018-03-05 17:29:39 "Diversity" is codeword for we white people want to feel good about ourselves. Turns POC into commodities.
118 2018-03-05 17:29:25 I'm old enough to remember the mid to late 90s where people thought the Internet would disintermediate and remove everything between you and products, particularly commodities. That didn't happen. There's a lot of knowledge and communication and hand holding still needed.
119 2018-03-05 17:19:20 Yes, we’ve achieved so much in 3 yrs, na? Rising unemployment, rising prices of basic commodities, hooliganism, lynching, “gau-rakshaks”, self-appointed thekedaars of Hinduism, judges disappearing, free escape for Mallya, Nirav Modi, blessings for Jay Shah. So much “development”!
120 2018-03-05 17:17:01 I’m sure you do and I’m sure you are, but obviously that love and attachment only extends to a certain point before profit takes over.

The animals aren’t your pets, they’re your commodities.

122 2018-03-05 17:14:28 What about commodities futures? You can sell things that don't even exist yet.
123 2018-03-05 17:09:30 Shri. So you feel that 12 percent per annum is being greedy? What about taking Rs 10000 cr from 13000 investors, issuing contracts for commodities, and giving them nothing? This is Jignesh Shahs NSEL.
124 2018-03-05 17:05:46 Oil and commodities can and are settled in all kind of currencies.
To keep it simple though most commodities (but not all, look i.e. at LME) and energies are quoted in USD same as for most currencies that is the main quotation (against USD).
125 2018-03-05 17:03:54 "I think that people want peace so much that one of these days government had better get out of their way and let them have it."  Dwight D. Eisenhower Cd it be UK Defence revenues up 1/3rd since Brexit. Who benefits from commodities shares et al
126 2018-03-05 17:03:25 bagaimanakah relasi antara ambisi kota yang selalu mendewakan efisiensi ruang sedangkan ruang sendiri sejatinya bernyawa anthropometric. See the problem? Urban commodities vs human scale. Almost impossible.
127 2018-03-05 16:57:05 Reading an economics book published in 1867 in Germany. Its talking about commodities, relative value and equivalent value. My head is spinning
128 2018-03-05 16:47:07 Não haverá trade-war nenhuma. A leverage está todo do lado dos EUA. Maiores produtores de petróleo, com acesso bilateral a commodities, and so on. A UE vai amochar e a China corrigir.

135 2018-03-05 16:29:35 Do you actually know what Trump is talking about?  He doesn't.  Canada uses quota systems to allocate production of certain agricultural commodities.  As it their right to control their own country.   Those quotas do not typically allow non quota holders to participate.

144 2018-03-05 16:00:05 no disrespect to Paul Tudor Jones, he is one of the greatest who ever did this thing, but when he says he is bullish commodities, he is talking his position. he is already very very long...

Hindu temples can be closed, wealth and commodities would dissolve among officials due to a new government campaign. Retweet to save Hindu temples!

148 2018-03-05 15:40:27 You understand to your Gov your a Commodities so are all our beautiful ponies if the Gov can make $$ off them they will just like Planned Butcherhood the money is laundered and laudered again when they give donations. A promise Trump made to defund them,  has not happened
149 2018-03-05 15:36:49 Exactly. Buying commodities because we're "late cycle" as an asset allocation decision doesn't seem substantially different from "own stocks into the blowoff top before a recession." 

At the end of the day, you're just recession timing.
150 2018-03-05 15:32:09 Seeing that we are fully dependent on some South African commodities I thought our Ministry of Health would say something on the #ListeriosisOutbreak in our neighboring country.  I only saw an almost invisible article in the Times of Swaziland.

165 2018-03-05 14:28:55 We need to take control of our own commodities as much as possible. It is smart strategy not to be reliant on others, but instead use them to our advantage fairly.
166 2018-03-05 14:19:18 Throughout its history, US was a protectionist country. That is how it became the manufacturing superpower and number one exporter. Considering China's indirect support to its SOEs, there is no other option. We have 30% customs tariff on almost all agro-commodities. Why?
167 2018-03-05 14:18:29 this is future probably - a myriad of nation (commodities mostly) coins. those that jump first get the prize.
168 2018-03-05 14:17:13 @JimCramerNews the US is “completely import-dependent for 19 key minerals resources and more than 50 percent import-dependent for an additional 24 mineral commodities” in the Defense Industry. A trade war could harm their supply. Steel and aluminum are not that critical.
169 2018-03-05 14:08:56 I would like to say it's a good reminder that water is a finite resource and we should take care to use it sparingly, but the answer is probably privatised infrastructure and commodities. Ho hum.

179 2018-03-05 13:22:43 I don't think he knows what he's doing. He's clearing out our market rather than our competition. He's making commodities more expensive, which will raise the price of everything. He's focusing on the wrong industries. He's choosing the wrong strategies.

182 2018-03-05 13:13:14 Help me with the rationale for this. Do you think levying strong tariffs on aluminum and steel will significantly increase the percentage of those commodities produced in the US. (It won't!) And if it won't-what happens to the "National Security" justification?

186 2018-03-05 12:52:48 @LizAnnSonders You made the same point in your tweet on 3/2. This is true that for many commodities. There are more people in industries  that use petroleum than in industries that PRODUCE it. But we must take a  strong stand with foreign suppliers of basic commodities.
187 2018-03-05 12:47:11 Trade wars will hurt farmers more than Mexico. Other countries are ready and willing to step up to buy their products. Canada/Mexico and other countries will boycott beef, wheat and other farm commodities from the US. There are unintended consequences of trade war.

203 2018-03-05 11:35:38 Jiten, in my opinion for commodities it is imperative that we look at supply side when determining the positive prospects of industry. In this case due to protectionism, domestic supply in US would increase. China having excess production would definitely diminish the price

Nowadays everything gets thrown away and we end up paying more in the end.

The question is who do you listen to? This is where price action coupled with risk management comes in. Focus on the present and what the market is telling you now.

261 2018-03-05 06:40:40 Nothing wrong with money. History just shows that money must be something with its own — intrinsic — VALUE.

In other words, money must have real value and be traded IN THE SAME WAY as other commodities: wheat, pears, gravel, iPhones, rocks, beets, diamonds.

264 2018-03-05 06:24:01 Iyerji, no one will buy this book about a thrice jailed fraudster who promoted #NSEL, which cheated 13000 investors of Rs 10000 crores. Why blame politicians if NSEL warehouse did not have any commodities?

280 2018-03-05 03:45:22 Boa noite, Cícero. Tudo bem? Vi que vc tem opiniões peculiares. Me desculpa, mas a crise foi gerada por governos petistas sim!!! 
Originado pela queda no Preço das commodities, uma carga tributária altíssima e um governo incapaz de fazer reformas necessárias há muito tempo.
281 2018-03-05 03:38:01 I will forever say that I hate internet producers. They are the reasons the game is so messed up. As soon as producer technology became vastly available and beats were plastered all over the internet they became commodities.
282 2018-03-05 03:34:56 Before you became Russian back potus of America you n your business dealings bought steel n aluminum from China n elsewhere so stop playing good cop v bad cop on trade. If you increase tariffs on those commodities the rest of the world will also increase tariff on ours. Stupid
283 2018-03-05 03:31:13 All jokes aside so many people get rid of them... one need not pay. If only all commodities were traded as such.
284 2018-03-05 03:29:53 There were undeniably pushing up the prices but not for those reasons. They wanted to prop up commodities firms and keep the banks from collapsing
285 2018-03-05 03:13:32 It's about all the good ideas being set into motion... ideas and plans don't need to be fix all's just help all's or even help somes. The gov. could open a department to recieve and help implement them. Commodities are a solid foundation that can fuel most anything.

287 2018-03-05 03:09:22 Is it too far fetched to think that China is/was pushing commodities prices up. Waiting for Fed to increase rates, then short after they reduce commodities prices & create event in the US. Creating some eco disruption on a already divided nation, while they deval and “clean”?
288 2018-03-05 03:05:30 In 2008 our economy went unto a tailspin from laws like Modernization Commodities Act of 2000. It got rid of the Great Depression Era laws for banking and credit industry!!!! The greed and destruction was worldwide. So the Frank Dodd Act was put in place to protect people.

295 2018-03-05 02:09:12 Liberal is never synonymous with Liberty. This is just a communist plot to bring us into the Babylonian world government system. Communism begets Regionalization which begets a Global governing body; where people are commodities for those with the power to enslave.

301 2018-03-05 01:35:26 To be fair you supported a person who touted Gramm-Leach-Billy, Commodities Futures modernization act, telecommunications act of 96, NAFTA, TPP, CTPA, TiSA, and charter schools. You may not be a neoliberal, but you support neoliberals.

304 2018-03-05 01:24:01 This is apples and oranges - like "when will stocks overtake commodities?"

310 2018-03-05 01:05:21 Exactly.  Don’t buy if they don’t lower the price.  For global commodities, we will be stuck with higher costs which could stimulate domestic sourcing.
311 2018-03-05 00:45:12 These are very rich investors. They buy many houses. Paying the council tax is nothing to these people. Houses should be homes. They should not be commodities for investors to speculate on and get richer.

312 2018-03-05 00:39:37 Impose tariff on steel that is almost obliterated!! It’s not fair if other countries will have a free trade coming to the USA but our commodity is taxed. Where’s the free trade? Why mad about taxation on commodities that they are already taxed on us that we don’t even know?
313 2018-03-05 00:26:45 You really want the strength of the US economy to depend on the price fluctuations of commodities?
314 2018-03-05 00:24:19 We have near-monopolies with AAPL, GOOG, NFLX, MSFT, FB. Imagine if Europe puts tariffs on that. Perhaps Ross is a "commodities dinosaur" , not suitable for the 21st century economy. Us sells goods & services, imports stuff cheaper to make abroad. That can't change overnight.
