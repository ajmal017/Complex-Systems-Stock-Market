38 2018-04-17 23:56:02 The irony is: if we went directly for the cure (legal ownership of the land) we wouldn't have to spend so much time treating all the symptoms (e.g. sovereignty, oil pipelines, etc).

We've been trained to avoid going for the land. Thats how they keep us going around in circles.
39 2018-04-17 23:55:58 You dumb shit. I worked in the oil field fracking wells and only used radioactive materials very,very seldom. Guess what, radioactive material is used in the cement sometimes that is used to cement the wells casing in place so the cement can be traced if the well is losing mud.
40 2018-04-17 23:55:47 Dat coconut oil finally got my damn beard connecting nshit 
41 2018-04-17 23:55:43 CBD oil has no "drug" effects, and can help anything from chronic pain to seizure disorders and cancer. Quite interesting if not for big pharma.
42 2018-04-17 23:55:36 .....and that was the reason the constant reference to Wike by some involved in soot march piqued me out. For one, gas flaring which is as bad has been going on legally. Is it not funny, how the list of rich Africans count owners of oil wells with no South South person
43 2018-04-17 23:55:33 World class may b inadequate but it is better than US is doing or any other oil producing nation many of whom have poor human rights/ women's rights records, environmental records & we r helping our indigenous ppl out of poverty. Why not support our own ppl 4 our own benefit?
44 2018-04-17 23:55:23 He sure is afraid of getting shot at....doing oil deals with Putin perhaps ? Sound proof phone booth, bullet proof car, extensive security, Why? Is he being threatened by Putin?
45 2018-04-17 23:55:09 A kid who shouts “fuck the NRA” isn’t interested in talking or compromise. He’s a paid shill. And you’re buying his snake oil. 
46 2018-04-17 23:54:59 Not true at all. Andrew Scheer is not the Canadian oil industry.  What I do not understand is CPC grandstanding after accomplishing zero on this file in a decade in power.

49 2018-04-17 23:53:56 My father was a geologist in Midland, TX, heart of the Permian Basin. MISD students took earth science in 8th grade. Virtually everyone I knew was in the oil business. This sub - thread thrilled me.
50 2018-04-17 23:53:52 What power does the premier have to cut shipments of privately owned oil and gas along a privately owned pipeline?
51 2018-04-17 23:53:42 Interrogate how “all women know” this factoid. Did you read it in a magazine? This is what the marketers tell you, but there is very little evidence that they do anything. All moisturisers are an emulsion of oil and water.

53 2018-04-17 23:53:27 I've never done microderm. Where did you get your machine? The mask is safe as long as you properly care for your skin, replenishing the oil and hydration. I use my Clarisonic twice a day and it's just not doing it anymore

65 2018-04-17 23:52:09 If you're gonna play the capitalist game then you gotta play by those rules.  If you don't want to pay taxes then live thrifty, grow your food, barter.  Otherwise you're contributing to the need for more oil, and tax dollars fund the wars that bring it to us.
66 2018-04-17 23:52:08 You will appreciate when your company starts providing complimentary matches and candles for you to burn the midnight oil.
67 2018-04-17 23:52:03 Selling Snake Oil!
68 2018-04-17 23:52:03 I encourage you to get a medical marijuana card if you don’t live somewhere that it’s legal (CO, WA). I use the 10:1 capsules and it is so helpful. There’s also a 0% thc oil that works wonders. 
The opioid crisis is very real though. I almost lost a child to addiction.
69 2018-04-17 23:52:01 Nakaka-miss yung mga panahon na uso sa mga lalake ang Johnson's Baby Oil ang nilalagay sa buhok at hindi pa uso ang wax! Tapos ang suklay ay Keempee!

72 2018-04-17 23:51:09 Helped with my spasms and inflammation and relaxing the muscles. I use a mix of cbd and thc oil.
73 2018-04-17 23:51:05 See the destruction to the Russian economy that Obama's 2014 sanctions caused.  That is why Russia is so mad.  Also includes the deal to have OPEC mess with the oil reserves to help tank Russian economy.
74 2018-04-17 23:50:59 Maybe if Alberta had diversified and taken a page from Norway's book and saved their oil money, they wouldn't be having economic issues. Why should Canada have to bail out Alberta's oil industry? #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet #abpoli #cdnpoli #GreenEnergy #ClimateChangeIsReal
75 2018-04-17 23:50:59 Nope, she gets the point for not being a stooge of the oil industry.

77 2018-04-17 23:50:55 Google theives oil. Incredible stuff. Used back in the days of the plague so theives could rob the dead bodies and not get the plague! Sounds gross I know but really works!
78 2018-04-17 23:50:54 Double standards people. I mean, BC can throttle their own environment. The natives there can be degenete pigs, leave their trash, dead cars everywhere, do oil changes in the middle of the parking lot, but sorry Alberta, your super safe  pipelines are dirty, we dont want em.
79 2018-04-17 23:50:41 And the government is finally allowing research into Rick Simpson’s Oil for its effects in reversing and even beating melanomas.
80 2018-04-17 23:50:34 Nobody told em cannabis oil can treat copd?
81 2018-04-17 23:50:33 The wise virgin were wise because when their oil ran low they had extra and refilled. We need to fill our proverbial lamps by staying constant in prayer and gods word and seeking his will.
82 2018-04-17 23:50:15 Yes. Oil rights. So tunnel digging and oil digging are the same, no? Doesn’t this mean the boring company will require more funding than any startup ever created?
83 2018-04-17 23:49:58 And yes I'm aware lube is an oil product
84 2018-04-17 23:49:38 Zinke served on the board of the oil pipeline company QS Energy (formerly Save the World Air) from 2012 to 2015. In November 2014, Zinke announced that he would pass Continental Divide to his family while remaining in an advisory role.

90 2018-04-17 23:48:51 True enough - but not this egg ( pipeline). Expanding oil infrastructure without much attempt to encourage green energy and without concern for the coast is so sad and shortsighted.Canada can do better - we don't need that omelette
91 2018-04-17 23:48:45 What’s odd is that’s where we started and the corps focused on centralization saying that the cloud  would make everything easy, but in reality it was they saw ‘data as the new oil’ behind closed doors.
92 2018-04-17 23:48:32 Lousianna has a lot of oil that's been pumped out of the ground. Nothing to do with rising levels but more likely subsiding land.  Land moves up and down as well as sideways buts never taken into account
93 2018-04-17 23:48:31 Finding our a tail light is out while getting an oil change. Only to laugh cuz i was followed my a cop and he didnt give me a ticket. So to that officer i say thank you.
94 2018-04-17 23:48:28 this like nanobots advertised as cleaning up oil spills but they put them in ice and like it eats everything it comes into contact with! idk why I thought of agent Cody Banks of all things....
95 2018-04-17 23:48:17 I’m not talking about law. I’m talking about locality and reality. The oil spill won’t destroy downtown Edmonton, no.
96 2018-04-17 23:48:16 As a matter of fact many foods are comprised of edible oil.
97 2018-04-17 23:47:49 It's only a matter of time before the Bush family starts mining Barbara's body for oil.

109 2018-04-17 23:46:22 But they do different bad things in different amounts based on race, so a MULTI-racial society ALL KINDS OF BAD THINGS HAPPEN AT MAX RATES ALL THE TIME!  It's in the Overlap, and is a Recipe for disaster!
110 2018-04-17 23:46:11 So i needed coolant for my car and i go to o’Riley’s and the man asked me if i needed help I’m like no I’m just looking for coolant he’s like well ma’am you’re in the oil section i couldn’t do anything it laugh. That’s too dumb
111 2018-04-17 23:46:10 told myself like 2 hours ago i was gonna go get my oil changed and im still in bed
112 2018-04-17 23:46:08 Someone else said that to me, that they lived in a place where people were expected to know how to change their own oil (if not do it), and that surprised me!
113 2018-04-17 23:46:07 Since the stuff is only legal in Michigan, but the state has closed most of the dispensaries (it makes no sense, I know) I mostly just use CBD oil. For that I have a SMOK OSUB Mini. I like it.
114 2018-04-17 23:46:05 Wake up man NBC is owned by military contractors, big pharma and big oil. Cable news is all OWNED.
115 2018-04-17 23:46:00 But to save real money we need to look at the big nonsense spending:
$24 billion farm subsidies , $15 billion in oil, gas, coal subsidies, regular stories of military waste, Trump gave $7 million to Carrier to save jobs in Indiana ( they went to Mexico anyway )
116 2018-04-17 23:45:59 Oil and Angela are definitely a killer combo!!!
117 2018-04-17 23:45:58 Oil and an overwhelming religious presence in the current governing directive. Seems legit.

120 2018-04-17 23:45:49 Mr. President, so is every driver at the gas pump. The American people are getting RIPPED OFF by the oil companies AGAIN. Please look into this. In December 2015, oil was $90.00 a barrel and gas was $2.79. Now gas is $3.09 and oil is $67.00 a barrel. What is going on???
121 2018-04-17 23:45:48 Got my CBD oil under my tongue and all is about to be right with the world.

123 2018-04-17 23:45:21 @realDonaldTrump Time to negotiate lower gas prices with these price gouging oil companies. Good by to our tax break. Taken at the gas pump.

126 2018-04-17 23:44:41 it technically doesn't even need one yet, the dealership i got the car through gave me a long ass warranty but i have to get my oil changed whenever they say to keep it
127 2018-04-17 23:44:40 i forgot to buy oil on the way home and i've never realized just how much i can not do in the kitchen without oil LOL
128 2018-04-17 23:44:39 Yes it’s actually a mixture of coconut oil and lavender 
129 2018-04-17 23:44:28 ...and not the future of humanity and of the Earth and its life support systems, but merely the profits promised to the shareholders of a Texas oil company, above every other consideration, and be damned to the consequences!"

133 2018-04-17 23:44:12 In DBT group, we were instructed to make a box with one item to soothe each of our 5 senses. I used a music box that played "The Shadow of Your Smile" and had peppermint oil , mints , a fidget cube , and a photo of my Dad and I when I was little

137 2018-04-17 23:43:49 ...do you not know how to change your oil? Or is your car one of those "fuck it, let's  make the filter impossible to get to!" Types?
138 2018-04-17 23:43:48 Oil floats on water so this isn't as crazy as it seems.
139 2018-04-17 23:43:42 The 'jack here' is my favorite, like a dude with a floor jack just wanders around the maintenance hanger doing oil changes.

149 2018-04-17 23:42:51 Good. We need new better law makers that aren’t beholden to oil and gas.
150 2018-04-17 23:42:46 I think cloves smell androgynous and you could just get some essential oil and mix it with a carrier oil to put it on
151 2018-04-17 23:42:21 Who eats oil and gas?!
152 2018-04-17 23:42:11 Try CBD oil. He won't get "stoned" but it helps relieve inflammation & pain.
153 2018-04-17 23:41:58 haha to keep the warranty on my jeep, i gotta get an oil change before may

but the place i gotta do it with doesnt do them at times that are convenient for me

so i either gotta get up stupid early and go before work, or leave work early

154 2018-04-17 23:41:37 Do you have any Tea Tree oil? That is great for burns.
155 2018-04-17 23:41:37 Throw in some red onion with and some oil and maybe some lime juice, salt and pepper, and you got a delicious salad that I’d eat a lot of.
156 2018-04-17 23:41:35 You can't just slap tea tree oil on your face and think you "glowin" sis.
157 2018-04-17 23:41:33 My wife makes an appointment for an oil change online with @pepboysauto for 7pm. I arrive at 6:57 to be told they only have one service tech on duty, and turned me away! #BadCustomerService
158 2018-04-17 23:41:17 Carry Theives Oil Katie. Takes care of most any germs/virus etc.
159 2018-04-17 23:41:17 That’s why I carry a wild orange and peppermint essential oil spray at all times. Problem solved.
160 2018-04-17 23:41:17 Growing energy production in Canada will need more than one oil pipeline - hence need for Line 3 and Keystone XL
161 2018-04-17 23:41:13 @realDonaldTrump Have you notice how the our gas  prices have gone up and up. So much for the tax break when the rich oil companies take it at the pump. No gain in this house hold. Why are we paying so much if we are becoming self sufficient??? Selling to other countries????
162 2018-04-17 23:41:11 @TheView Thanks for bringing the Stormy Davis Circus with its Snake oil salesman to a national platform, American Broadcasting Clowns!
163 2018-04-17 23:41:09 I might feel a bit more secure about marine oil spill response capability on the BC coast if Ottawa hadn't in effect offloaded it's responsibilities to a private company half owned by a pipeline firm. @CoastGuardCAN @MarineResponse
164 2018-04-17 23:41:04 It doesn't change anything, the oil tankers leaving Westridge will be untethered once they reach the Anacortes shipping lanes and will be susceptible to whatever tragedy fell upon the #sanchi off the coast of China after that. It's a long voyage, just to sell some oil.
165 2018-04-17 23:40:57 Isn’t their stuff amazing! My skin is having issues at the moment so I’m trying to pump it with moisture - their antioxidant rosehip oil is so amazing! I haven’t tried their night cream.
166 2018-04-17 23:40:48 Because capitalism is voluntary and if you're so against big oil you'd just walk/bike everywhere, obviously. 

Ugh these people
167 2018-04-17 23:40:42 Do you have proof that the protesters are doing that? Or are you going to keep making assumptions because BC, FN, and the people are standing up to big oil and #KinderMorgan? The NEB process is far from being fair or reliable. Try again. #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet #bcpoli #cdnpoli
168 2018-04-17 23:40:39 @Wendys is slipping. Just had this sandwich. Chicken was terrible: super greasy and too well done. Did they forget mine in the oil? Seems like they are not using the regular chicken. Lower quality for sure. 
Brightside: LimeAid is pretty on point.

170 2018-04-17 23:39:52 The days of getting on our high horse are over. The Seven State Solution is at hand. Know the players and the motive. When the demand for oil is unsustainable due to war, remember, there's always Canadian Tar Sands to fall back on. #Syria #opNWO #tcot #tlot #ccot #p2 #UniteBlue
171 2018-04-17 23:39:46 Im so stressed right now that my sister is lighting “stress relief” candles in my room and having me put lavendar oil on my temples ;_;
172 2018-04-17 23:39:40 I’m getting my oil changed and eww I’m walking lol
173 2018-04-17 23:39:32 Build to send Cdn energy to Cdns and our growing world. Canada has 16 refineries. Cdns and world need both raw and refined oil - we should ship both @TransMtn #cdnpoli #canpoli #bcpoli #ABleg

175 2018-04-17 23:39:16 I don't have a say in the oil our country imports. Which isn't that much from Saudi Arabia anyway.
176 2018-04-17 23:39:00 Rach threatens to stop the flow of oil! Shit or get off the pot #Bluff. Man am I sick of bullshit politics. Just do your job. Confederation is a thing of the past ! But thanks Sasky for getting on board 
177 2018-04-17 23:38:25 Like the "snake oil" salesman of 100 years ago, if Trump doesn't get out of town before the truth is known, he and his helpers will be tarred and feathered by the tricked townspeople!
178 2018-04-17 23:38:24 Ahh just realized you were an Okie - How are those primary schools there? How about those roads? LOL is Oil and Gas gonna leave OK if they raise taxes? Ok has the lowest in the Nation and the most earthquakes in Nation
179 2018-04-17 23:38:22 There would be a much lower demand for oil and therefore much lower production of pollution.
180 2018-04-17 23:38:21 We're discussing eating seal, oil and gas with @GeorgeMurphyOil
181 2018-04-17 23:38:20 It's called change, and Walmart, target, homedepot, yada...also had ppl crying destroying mom and pop stores. At least small business can sell thru Amazon. Might as well complain big oil interfering with clean energy, big pharma with ..u get the idea. Jealousy
182 2018-04-17 23:38:15 When I travel across the country I’m seeing more and more of these turbines.  It’s amazing how you get use to them.  Obviously, not in the hundreds... maybe work on solar energy. The people I know that could afford them are loving it.  I hate relying on oil..
183 2018-04-17 23:38:12 You are LYING AS USUAL Mike. You raped the treasury of the American taxpayers of 4TRILLION$ to give HUGE TAX CUTS to the rich, your big donors, corps. You’ve made the tax code more complicated w rich loopholes for oil & gas co, real estate &all rich investors
184 2018-04-17 23:38:10 Some dude is probably dead because an oil truck exploded

189 2018-04-17 23:37:37 Jekyll & Hyde Trudeau! Talking climate change to the French and forcing the Kinder Morgan pipeline in Canada! The Alberta tar sands produces the dirtiest oil; four times as much greenhouse gas emissions per barrel compared to regular crude oil. Clean up your own backyard Trudeau!
190 2018-04-17 23:37:20 You're dirt bag. A coward that will no debate the issue. You instead choose to be a snake oil salesman.

Sometimes I pour some sugar syrup (1:1, like what you make for hummingbirds) in it to “get them interested” & looking.
199 2018-04-17 23:36:25 Trump is the 1st President to:

4)Allow Oil Products to be Exported.
5)Open up the MOST Federal lands for Drilling.
6)Take on China, Russia, N.Korea & Iran.           #AmericaFirst

202 2018-04-17 23:35:53 I’m kinda use to seeing some of the wind turbines in Atlantic City.  I think we could get use to it? I do think we need to do a much better job in lowering costs for solar energy. I am tired of relying on other countries for our oil.... hating that...
203 2018-04-17 23:35:44 CBC what did you expect! More maybe from the CBC dedicated team of comedy writers! They burn the midnight oil so the hacks can churn out more froth and spew! Another barrage of bullshit loaded in the printer ports! Click Gone to the masses! Must be nice to have no moral compass!
204 2018-04-17 23:35:44 A few observations: 1) ‘global solar’ isn’t a monolithic industry; 2) the world ‘could’ run on 100% solar; 3) (re: solar ‘should grow up’) US  structural support for oil, NG, coal dwarfs support for solar; 4) inflexible grid is an example of 3.
205 2018-04-17 23:35:35 What he doesn't tell Cap in this trailer is: 1.  All of the oil and dirt stains he's going to aquire. 2. The brain crushing exhaust and gas fumes while he's driving, and the fact that all of that weight and wood paneling is going to give him about 3 mpg....but it was the 70's 
206 2018-04-17 23:35:33 game 3 i have no hope. when the caps lose i am going to throw myself into a vat of hot oil
207 2018-04-17 23:35:32 Lol if u leave in haifefe house,dnt throw stones aha
208 2018-04-17 23:35:28 I always have sesame oil but would have to think about getting tahini so it works perfectly for us.
209 2018-04-17 23:35:13 After living in Alaska for many years & witnessing the drastic changes to the interior due to severe weather change this is GREAT NEWS. Cities and states need to pull together to get this done. Keeping oil companies tied up in court could be beneficial to the world.
210 2018-04-17 23:35:10 I won’t say name, but a dear friend of mine told me he uses “coconut oil” for sex. Is this taboo or normal?
211 2018-04-17 23:35:05 Don't get too excited. Canada's half of the 'dream team' is pushing to expand the country's ability to export our dirty oil.
212 2018-04-17 23:34:39 Back of the napkin. Feel free to correct me. Over the last 10 years if we had global market access It would be 91 TRILLION dollars in oil revenue. (Assuming we have been getting only 65% selling to USA) 
213 2018-04-17 23:34:37 While I agree, I also say and have often said "I can't believe you don't change your own oil" People aren't obligated to know how to fix their bike, but part of car culture is learning mechanics, we need that for bikes too.
214 2018-04-17 23:34:35 Has anyone took notice how the gas  prices have soared up. So much for the tax break for the economy. For the rich oil companies to take advantage of us again. No gain in this house hold.

216 2018-04-17 23:34:16 Get off your high horse. You're part of the problem, contributing to the demand for oil.

224 2018-04-17 23:33:15 Chevron makes important technological contributions by bringing our most effective methods to the Venezuelan oil industry.
225 2018-04-17 23:33:12 I just want an oil spill ticket 
226 2018-04-17 23:33:02 How long before Obama gets a peace prize for that?
227 2018-04-17 23:32:56 Just a small sampling of the corruption by the GOP and Trump Pruitt has spent millions of dollars on security that he doesn't need. He he wasted money on a soundproof phone booth so he can make deals with oil tycoons that I'm sure are illegal and underhanded. Then there's Zinke!
228 2018-04-17 23:32:45 One dish I can never make taste decadent is shrimp. I've currently got half a peeled pound sitting in a lemon/oil/spice mix and it'll be worth about 2 of the minutes I put into prep.

230 2018-04-17 23:32:32 The only hypocrite here is you. The Mount Polley disaster was caused by the @bcliberals who would rather put Alberta's oil over BC's rights.

231 2018-04-17 23:32:20 Well actually, you do have 2 Billion dollars. You just have to convince your MP that you know it’s your money and you don’t agree with how they are giving it away to a foreign oil company.

237 2018-04-17 23:31:37 It’s because he doesn’t have access to the “new” money vs oil & gas and real estate.  And most tech companies fall more on the left
238 2018-04-17 23:31:25 This pipeline will export oil, how will that help gas prices? Also food prices haven't skyrocketed in provinces that already have a carbon tax.
239 2018-04-17 23:31:09 He's giving it to his oil buddies. How do you feel about that? Does that even get reported on your fake News Channel? Do you know how much money was wasted and travel expenses by Pruitt to lobby for oil companies? Do you know how much money was wasted by his other cabinet members

253 2018-04-17 23:29:54 My cooking tip for the day is that if you want to make your own hummus you can use some sesame oil instead of tahini. It keeps for ages in your pantry, costs less and can be used for so many things.

Japan owns half of a coal plant that they use to mine oil in Houston called Petra Nova. 
Surely they discussed this.
272 2018-04-17 23:27:58 The fracking commercials big oil airs in Colorado are so pandering and condescending that I know they must work. Simple folks want simple answers. Big Oil pays millions to make these people believe it is in their best interest.

277 2018-04-17 23:27:32 It’s a transfer of oil between two vessels out at sea. The oil comes from the Kurdish Regional Government of northern Iraq. The transfer is done in a clandestine fashion (and at night) because Baghdad says that oil (and its revenue) belongs to them.

285 2018-04-17 23:26:40 Horgan is a hypocrite. Limited oil entering BC should be what he wants since it'll reduce usage and pollution. Instead he's too busy approving the Mount Polley mine waste. Disgusting.

288 2018-04-17 23:26:04 Except that big oil welcomes a price on carbon, F of S does not.

299 2018-04-17 23:25:15 If Alberta’s Bill 12 passes and is enacted to limit oil/gas exports, then why not a parallel BC bill concerning limiting bitumen imports/exports within its borders?  #canpoli #bcpoli #cdnpoli
300 2018-04-17 23:25:03  Would you try my CBD  oil if I offered you a money back guarantee
301 2018-04-17 23:24:59 That's pretty bad on both ends. I've never had a problem with my local one here. They've only done oil changes though
302 2018-04-17 23:24:58 Maybe BC can import more oil from Saudi Arabia or Venezuela. 
303 2018-04-17 23:24:57 Why do we hurt the ones who love us? 

( me@ the burger that splashed scalding oil all over my hand today)
304 2018-04-17 23:24:46 We have released all we can and waiting to get further information ourselves. Comparatively to any other oil company, we release more then they do on actual play-by-play operations. We do appreciate the interest and excitement though.

306 2018-04-17 23:24:40 Cause of dirty oil money, it is the gold mine of everything and the centre of so called "foreign policy" of the U.S and U.K , The Saudi government know that and can get away with it, their also being supplied the ammunition necessary to continue what they are doing too !

310 2018-04-17 23:24:02 Yet oil and gas caused Alberta economy to tank taking food off Families tables. hardly sound like humanity to me. Of course that kind of bigotry is what people come to expect from @bcliberals supporters. They put Alberta first over BC. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet

312 2018-04-17 23:23:47 I bought a salt lamp, got some lavender oil for my diffuser, found a great sleep/meditation playlist, and my deep sleep tincture. Not gonna lie, I'm a little scared I'm going to fall into a coma tonight.

317 2018-04-17 23:23:12 Alex, when you talk about impeaching @realDonaldTrump you lose my interest, keep it up and you will lose my respect and viewership. Yea, I can't defend bombing Syria, I have no idea why    dropped bombs. I'll bet it involves Turkey, Israel, Iran, and OIL.
318 2018-04-17 23:22:52 Wait you did such a good depriving Albertans. You do realize between Alberta and Saskatchewan we as a country can be energy independent. No foreign dirty questionable oil. But where were you for energy east????????????????????????
319 2018-04-17 23:22:47 Ive held $ATH.to since 2017, first entering at 1.40 but loaded up heavily at 0.90 and remained long. Super high hopes (like $3 for 2018 and higher for 2019) on ATH. Up to 40kboed of production (mostly acquired from #Statoil) ready to fire if pipelines come and oil keeps rising.
320 2018-04-17 23:22:46 Does lavender oil help you sleep even if you don't like the smell?  Eureka that smells dreadful.

327 2018-04-17 23:21:38 Shut down our oil service company after 28 years of business. Laid off employees with 24, 22, 14 and 11 years with us.
328 2018-04-17 23:21:36 That is a half measure. We need to reduce our reliance on oil and leave it in the ground so there isn't a need for more of this terrible infrastructure.
329 2018-04-17 23:21:34 is the world ending? if so, french fries with truffle oil and parmesan and a nice big filet would be nice...chocolat cake...
330 2018-04-17 23:21:30 One difference. The countries you list don't, AKAIK, produce oil. We have it in abundance.
331 2018-04-17 23:21:18 You are a national embarrassment, and a classless snake oil salesman.
332 2018-04-17 23:20:35 I just paid $9 for a bag of #PatatasFritasTorres with truffle oil. 1,000% worth it.
333 2018-04-17 23:20:30 Put my elbow in syrup somebody didn't clean up and spilled oil on myself at work. Did I mention I'm ready to quit.
334 2018-04-17 23:20:15 Snake oil
335 2018-04-17 23:19:57 Unfortunately weather is probably going to get worse as Greenland melts!  We have to stop exporting oil and slow climate change.  In the meantime, maybe a shot of whisky?

345 2018-04-17 23:18:19 @carolemacneil CPC claiming JT didn’t really want pipeline is a laugh. I don’t like the bitumen track but we all use the current pipe each day we drive. I’d dislike to use Saudi oil. #pickle #crux
346 2018-04-17 23:18:12 I don’t think anything you do makes rapini not bitter lol. I just sautéed in olive oil, lemon and garlic plus spice by club house. It’s still bitter but not as bad.

356 2018-04-17 23:15:57 Pipelines are the safest way to transport oil. I do agree though there has to be gigantic penalties for any kind of spill, or just not following proper procedures to begin with. What is out there now is a joke..companies face very little consequence if something goes wrong
357 2018-04-17 23:15:50 @pressenterprise why aren’t you working on mass transit solutions to address the real problem?  Oil lobbyists?
358 2018-04-17 23:15:24 That helps a bit with the $, but the average was more like 94cts. Still, that applied to oil prices would raise it to 75$ barrel, still well below 2013 oil prices.  Blocking oil pipelines will hurt the economy, but allowing it will not help Canadians at the pump.  Tks for reply
359 2018-04-17 23:15:23 I have a Kinder Morgan Liquids rating and my regular job for 5 years was loading and unloading trucks, railroad cars, tanker ships and barges with oil products.

388 2018-04-17 23:12:10 So exporting for profit, and pfrfiting through distribution and retail sales. Why does it have to be up to the consumers to finance the oil industry?

391 2018-04-17 23:12:03 BC, and the rest of us, now know that Saskatchewan is NOT a reliable and trustworthy supplier of gas and oil products. AB and SK are acting like Russia. Time to find new sources of oil and gas. The US has plenty. And, rapidly move to renewables.

You have anointed my head with oil;
My cup overflows." Psalm 23:4-5 #Bible
417 2018-04-17 23:08:48 As of now any oil refined in Alberta would be subject to Carbon tax whereas in the US it is not. I agree we should refine more in Canada but as with everything else the Liberals make it harder to invest and do business in Canada.

431 2018-04-17 23:07:34 If I lived there I'd be concerned too but oil can and has been moving safely thru our waters - it's up to GOV to ensure that laws & regs cover every conceivable issue, that risk is minimised & that everything is taken care of in the event of an accident #bcpoli #TransMountain

445 2018-04-17 23:05:36 Does this explain why reducing emissions in Scandinavia entails investing in renewables, whereas in Canada it entails investing into pipelines and promoting oil sands development?
446 2018-04-17 23:05:33 im.... ANNOYEDT if you cannot tell.... damn these are a special breed of whites. these them no salt extra virgin olive oil mayo kinda binches
447 2018-04-17 23:05:17 Meanwhile countless jobs on the coast and in forestry are lost and entire industries cripple when the inevitable spills happen. We don't need it. Those oil jobs could be just as easily replaced with renewable projects.
448 2018-04-17 23:05:08 sad really, infatuated with Greed selfishness just like #Nutlet #Trudeau #Liberals #NDP #Conservatives are all in that dirty oil pit and they will risk everything to keep their cash flowing from the #Oil corporations #corrupt to the core #STOPKM #OilOFF #bcpoli #cdnpoli #Alberta
449 2018-04-17 23:05:07 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President. Would you please have a team look at the gasoline and diesel pricing. When oil was $90.00 per barrel, we were paying much less than we are now. There must be a reasonable profit margin for oil that is drilled on public lands. Fuel IS our economy!!!
450 2018-04-17 23:05:01 Requiring a license to export products? In the long run you are going to start charging a larger and larger fee  for a license and thus push away more external investment in our oil industry. Shame, shame,  shame on you.
451 2018-04-17 23:05:00 You mean support american oil industry.

454 2018-04-17 23:04:52 Is there anything tea tree oil can’t do
455 2018-04-17 23:04:50 Absolutely. Anyone preaching to end oil/gas full stop is completely idiotic. The argument of “well, it takes oil/gas to make these things, so we probably just should not bother”, is pretty tired. 

There aren’t many logical reasons to not pursue a transition to cleaner power gen.

459 2018-04-17 23:04:42 I use moisturizer every day, twice a day. I have 2 different ones. One is an oil free Mary Kay product and the other is called Muji Milk and I ordered it from Japan, but this is just what I use. In general with skincare, look for products better suited to dry skin.

464 2018-04-17 23:03:22 Yeah that nice! Hey bby does cbd oil have a expiration date? Ive had and been using it for about 3 months?
465 2018-04-17 23:03:21 I don't know if I have the money to afford that. I'm going to hire an external auditor to find efficiencies in my spending so I can buy your snake oil.
466 2018-04-17 23:03:00 During WW2 the US gov ordered cotton farmers to plow their crops into the ground and plant hemp for uniforms & rope they even made a vidoe called "hemp for victory" seems Dupont couldn't produce their oil based nylon quick enough when they improved they demonized cannabis..

490 2018-04-17 23:00:19 I thought we had access to millions of dollars through an oil and gas investment co. Isn’t it late to arrange funds when we should be drilling already. I’ll still hold all mine though.

493 2018-04-17 23:00:10 News may be fake. But if you actually watch from all angles of all news outlets you can find the truths. For me I figured that we always at war because we like the Currency War. It's not even about oil. US has plenty also the switch to alternative fuels is really ramping up.
494 2018-04-17 23:00:03 I want to start using "Chronic Farting" the same way folks say "Big Oil", to talk about Google/Facebook/etc.
495 2018-04-17 23:00:00 The nite is as dark as my soul &amp; as in my apartment. My apartment is also dark b/c I ran out of lamp oil. My soul is also out of lamp oil.
496 2018-04-17 22:59:41 An oil for anything and everything!
497 2018-04-17 22:59:28 Surely Ms Notley must know the loss of business with such a stoppage would kill what’s left of their faultering oil economy. Alberta oil workers would run her out of town. It’s either an empty bluff or the dumbest most irresponsible and divisive anti-Canadian plan ever conceived.
498 2018-04-17 22:59:21 There is never going to be an oil bonanza again. Why else is Andrew Wilson not basing his Growth Commission report on oil revenues?

Time is now to begin weaning off that tit, and invest in renewable energies, better cleaner jobs.

529 2018-04-17 22:55:43 OK I want you to do something either today or tomorrow. I want you to get a container of olive oil and I want you to pray over it and even get someone else to pray over it and then I want you to anoint over every single doorway in the place that you live.
530 2018-04-17 22:55:41 I would like to respond to this tweet in a well executed/thought out way. But my time is limited. Consumerism is the problem. Not the oil patch or any other single enterprise. Capitalism has failed. By definition. We the human are now the resource to exploit!
531 2018-04-17 22:55:41 BECAUSE he is really conducting oil business deals for putin/trump! That is why he wanted a sound proof room! He knows what putin will do if he fahks up! Putin's his boss, but we pay his salary, security, office etc
532 2018-04-17 22:55:38 But the Saudi Arabia would say no when she would ask "can we have more oil?"

552 2018-04-17 22:51:56 Did the gas/oil companies get tax cuts? Gas is up over  $3 gallon in Illinois. How do their tax cuts help consumers? Seems like they got their cake and are eating it too!!
553 2018-04-17 22:51:42 Great stat. Good tweet.  God bless Texas oil.
554 2018-04-17 22:51:35 But here's the thing NO ONE talks about -Trump raised GAS PRICES by about 15 cents over gal which costs way more than any paltry tax break that the middle and lower classes will see.

565 2018-04-17 22:49:47 I need oil for my pen hmu
566 2018-04-17 22:49:40 えー、昨夜ツイッター落ちたのって、松潤のせいなの～？ったく相撲協会め・・・
567 2018-04-17 22:49:34 I understand what government is trying to accomplish and appreciate that stance you are taking to put Sask first. But shouldn't private Sask businesses determine where they want their product marketed?? Does the gov operate its own set of gas/oil wells?
568 2018-04-17 22:49:29  nothing to be honest lol I don’t mess with it much these days just a wash every 4-5 weeks & a lil oil. It’s in a bun most days or wrapped up
569 2018-04-17 22:49:23 Micah 6:7 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

571 2018-04-17 22:49:07 Thinking of the London Marathon reminds me of a week in 1995.  We finished writing a book, Mark ran the Marathon, I drove him home to Norfolk and gave him a leg massage with rosemary oil.  Four days later I had a hysterectomy.  Quite a week! #LondonMarathon
572 2018-04-17 22:48:57 pls there's an impending unrest that might break down at Oke odo market,iyana ipaja Lagos due to the proposed demolition of the market by LG state govt and incarceration of the Hausa and Yoruba market heads @KwankwasoRM @AkinwunmiAmbode from the protest I saw today.
Act Now!!!
573 2018-04-17 22:48:55 The west's involvement for oil, opium etc etc alongside fkg mind blowing amounts of weapons being handed to terrorists causing endless carnage and war. Kick them all out, strip weapons from thugs there.
574 2018-04-17 22:48:46 @KingBroly
Venezuela, one of the richest oil countries in the world... is now importing oil Because socialism has made it so they can't staff their rigs.
575 2018-04-17 22:48:44 The dust storms in West Texas are pretty bad but I'm certain worse in other parts of the world; and now that it's become a big fracking region for natural gas and oil, you can taste the sentiments of the gas/oil in your mouth sometimes as the dust blows through, yuck.
576 2018-04-17 22:48:43 “is there an essential oil that gets me a boyfriend?”
577 2018-04-17 22:48:35 How is that Lebanon can take in over 1 million Syrian refugees with very limited resources but Australia can somehow only fit 16,000, I’ve literally spent all night crying at the fact that over 400 people have died in the past 2 weeks because of men who want power, oil and money
578 2018-04-17 22:48:23 @SentinAM . WTI bearish for 4/18/2018. Weekly rise in US crude oil stocks.
579 2018-04-17 22:48:15 Like you know those soggy oil soaked fries that ooze oil as soon as you bite into them... that’s what I had and now I want to sleep and never wake up
580 2018-04-17 22:48:15 Why are we in Yemen?
Why are we in Syria?
We have Oil, enemies, allies, refugees, immigrants, etc. in THIS hemisphere, & many other places!
581 2018-04-17 22:47:55 Like Flint, and like the Horizon oil disaster...those are some of the deeper journalism that I appreciate.

She cites sources and will retract. I don't always watch her.

I also enjoy NPR. 

I'd rather have facts then an opinion show. 4/
582 2018-04-17 22:47:45 Fine. Let's do the same to California oil companies..
583 2018-04-17 22:47:39 I know there is oil on my land!
584 2018-04-17 22:47:38 For someone who was going to “drain the swamp”, this president sure did bring on a lot of grifters and snake oil salesmen.
585 2018-04-17 22:47:35 Did some work on my sisters car. Some ass hole put the wrong fluids in the power steering. Motor oil. But that's what I'm here for as an older brother. The last guy who worked in it for her must of been a meat ball.
586 2018-04-17 22:47:15 Let your steak sit on the side for 20 mins to warm up. Oil it and season with salt and pepper. Heat up a pan until it's smoking, then cook it, flip once, then let it rest for 10 minutes. :D
587 2018-04-17 22:47:05 He does seem 2 have Bach Degree w/major in Geology. Some1 might want 2 check U of Oregon 2 B sure, but that detail seems legit, so far.
Important 2 remember not all geologists R environmentalists. Some only study geology bcuz want 2 dig 4 gold, jewels, oil other valuables.
588 2018-04-17 22:46:58 country is not made sure will walk in and @NASCAR yesterday in Trump Tower Ave, N. C. in oil for our side--killed.
589 2018-04-17 22:46:56 This is why they want to destroy him. The Constitution is for the people and the Congressional pawns sitting on their throws are not able to oil the wheels of the people who bought their seat.
590 2018-04-17 22:46:50 Just ate French fries that were fried before the oil was hot enough and it feels like I literally DRANK oil... I’m actually gonna throw up
591 2018-04-17 22:46:44 I got an oil change for my car @turbotax #MasterOfAdulting #sweepstakes
592 2018-04-17 22:46:35 Everytime I light my candles I play with the matches. I FUCKIN’ BURNT MY THUMB AND MY INDEX FINGER!!! Thankfully coconut oil saved me  #coconutoilisthesolutiontofuckingeverythingbruh
593 2018-04-17 22:46:35 I hate waiting for my oil in my car to be changed 
594 2018-04-17 22:46:31 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
595 2018-04-17 22:46:15 Great for those who have time and money, but oil and mining provide the means to get there, and the materials for the fancy hiking gear.  All work together
596 2018-04-17 22:46:05 Oil wrestling, please.
597 2018-04-17 22:45:55 can’t wait to sob alone in a crowd of Philadelphia dads at the Guided By Voices gig tonight.
598 2018-04-17 22:45:13 Can’t we just let Quebec leave. And tax the billions in oil they are hiding up north.
599 2018-04-17 22:45:10 #DidYouKnow 

You can save your baby from the dozens of chemicals in diaper cream by using coconut oil? Coconut oil is super safe for your baby’s bum while still moisturizing and killing bacteria.
600 2018-04-17 22:44:53 Wouldn't it be grand if one of these politicians actually admitted why they REALLY invaded Syria? @RandPaul is slippery sloping around the truth. This whole invasion is to give the "appropriate" invaders the oil & the building of the pipelines. Exactly what Assad refuses to do.

605 2018-04-17 22:44:36 Motivation for Illegal Missile attack on Syria   was Oil and the USA/Israel wanting to get their hands on Syrian Oil USA did the same in Iraq and Afghanistan! Illegal Wars to Gain OIl and Money ! Killed Thousands to sate their uncontrollable Greed Infection !
606 2018-04-17 22:44:31 Shut the taps off now and they can have all the jet fuel they need. They are bitching  about oil and the prairies can’t get grain to coast because of their coal trains
607 2018-04-17 22:44:24 Hey Delta Oil & Gas, Inc. thanks for the follow!
608 2018-04-17 22:44:24 Do other organizations also partake in nepotism in lower level positions or is this isolated just to Oil? Not that I’m defending it with Oil but wouldn’t be surprised if a league wide action
609 2018-04-17 22:44:18 SO THE WEIRDEST THING JUST HAPPENED.

Popped into work earlier to chat w/ my manager about not closing at all, & he didn't realise it was a "permanent" thing-I was talking about all the shit I've tried i.e. vegan, nightshade free&he was like, "But... have you tried cannabis oil?"
610 2018-04-17 22:44:17 I've just read about your travelling/working schedule after the Marathon.  I suggest a leg massage afterwards with rosemary oil.  My husband ran in 1995, and said it worked miracles.  Was quite a week for us:  we finished writing a book, he ran the Marathon, I had a hysterectomy!
611 2018-04-17 22:43:49 I lost it at Bucky's oil sheen blow out.

616 2018-04-17 22:43:27 Go enter my giveaway on my Young Living Facebook page for a chance to win a bottle of oil & a water bottle!
617 2018-04-17 22:43:20 Coconut nut oil is amazing
618 2018-04-17 22:43:18 Happens a lot on turbo diesel cars, end up running on the oil and going bang. Always recommended changing pipes,banjos as well as the turbo when I was on roads instead of rails. My Focus did it on the M40.Joybells. Was fun watching the Rev counter go critical with no throttle 
619 2018-04-17 22:42:59 You gotta oil your cat every few thousand miles
620 2018-04-17 22:41:56 Im sure you didn't mind the oil payouts that have been making this country strong for years.

Don't take the dirty Alberta oil money, Albertans will gladly keep it and watch you unrealistic babies cry after.

Hopefully your guitar strings are not nylon made from petroleum
621 2018-04-17 22:41:49 Not sure what this keto shit is about but I’m sorry a recipe with butter, cream cheese, and coconut oil plus other oils and fats is not good for you.
622 2018-04-17 22:41:32 it's the safest and highest paying automotive factory in california

and it's the only automotive factory in california

and the oil companies would love for it to go out of business.
623 2018-04-17 22:41:03 We do embrace renewable energy. That doesn't change the demand for oil and gas, or our ability to supply it.
624 2018-04-17 22:40:56 Oil on silk/satin is a no-go. It’ll leave grease spots all over
625 2018-04-17 22:40:51 Oh yeah, the "enterprise grade" thing is all snake oil. But sadly people keep buying into it and will always ask. If you're running a consultancy I can see how it would make sense to stay ahead of that line of thinking.
626 2018-04-17 22:40:31 Do you want synthetic oil or regular? Cause you know the white/old boy protective association will find him a home.

630 2018-04-17 22:40:11 But we wouldn’t get why we were sitting in the middle of an oil field. Again, it’s subjective and not everyone will appreciate it, but I do. Will BO4 be ruined without a campaign? No. But it’d definitely feel different, and I don’t think it would be a positive change 
631 2018-04-17 22:40:10 BC Liberals put Alberta's economy first. An oil spill on BC's coast would devastate the BC economy which depends heavily on a clean coast.
632 2018-04-17 22:39:45 That $6 billion cost is bullshit. It ignores that climate change costs, including using >20% of known oil, gas and coal reserves and not wasting $ looking for more.
633 2018-04-17 22:39:35 I really got an ounce of bud and two grams of oil for $105. #Dealzz
634 2018-04-17 22:39:34 Hot oil flew from the pot on to my eyelid.. 
My Eyelid!
635 2018-04-17 22:39:27 No. I Can't at all. 

OK brightspark..  What's the problem going on at the moment?

OK.. We got oil...  Market domination.. War..

What else?
636 2018-04-17 22:39:21 Good!  Did you know that oil is not a renewable resource Mr. Sheer? Eventually, no matter who governs, we have to phase out our reliance on oil ;)
637 2018-04-17 22:39:18 my seasonal depression will be cured when my coconut oil stays in liquid form for longer than two days
638 2018-04-17 22:39:02 I tried to buck the job for some essential oil right.. rosemary... bihhh I put some in a cup came back that shit ate through the cup and was spilled all over the table mission failed like shit
639 2018-04-17 22:38:56 Our children n grandchildren inherit this additional debt. What do u n GOP care. None of you will b around 2 pay it. Your millionaire children won't pay it back either.The little guy's children will b stuck w the debt.I've no respect for you snake oil salesman.
640 2018-04-17 22:38:47 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
641 2018-04-17 22:38:37 Furthermore, since the bombing raids over Syria, the oil company that theresa May's husband has shares in, has had rapid increase in the market.
642 2018-04-17 22:38:31 olive oil, the squash, salt, pepper, garlic, warmed in a pan, fresh dill at the last minute ... mmm
643 2018-04-17 22:38:29 #Alpha is rubbing me so softly and with just the right amount of coconut oil #queen #goddess #superiorcouple 
644 2018-04-17 22:38:20 @petrocanada @Suncor in 2013 oil was 91$/barrel  and gas was 1.25 in Ottawa. In 2018 gas is 1.25 and oil is 66$/barrel.  Care to explain? Don't we have our own oil? And Canadians are to support #KinderMorgan ...for what? Higher prices?  @ctvottawa @GasBuddyDan #gasprices
645 2018-04-17 22:38:15 What a kind thing to say, Simon. As you know, C of C is no ‘snake oil’ show. Those of us involved just think bringing together people who love comedy is a good thing to do.

 [Sounds po-faced. Edit before sending, FFS]
646 2018-04-17 22:38:01 Don’t forget the EPA Administrator’s sound proof phone booth that costs $43K!

And why did Pruitt need a ‘Security Phone Booth’?

What did he not want heard as EPA Director?

Calls from Big Oil?
Car makers?
A little ‘Prid Pro Quo’ goings on?

Really?
647 2018-04-17 22:37:47 I don't like the restrictions either. The people of BC pay the price and for what. This has gotten ridiculous and now SK is going to pile on and support AB by looking at imposing the same restrictions on oil and gas to BC
648 2018-04-17 22:37:35 In my opinion The problem is deeper than the control of oil I think America wants to control the world and because of Assad's refusal to bow to American decisions this war was launched to remove his rule and put a new president of America !
649 2018-04-17 22:37:17 help will coconut oil stain my beautiful new silk sheets or can I cover myself in it like a slug
650 2018-04-17 22:37:10 I’m already in drip @9.65 avg. was I way 2 early? I’m worried about oil going to 70
651 2018-04-17 22:37:05 @Bayer @Gillette @LibertyMutual @ProcterGamble @pfizer @GSK_bio - it’s time  to #DumpHannity cuz @seanhannity    sells snake oil.  Your ad $$s are better spent elsewhere- where truth counts.

655 2018-04-17 22:36:53 And discussed how NZ is banning all new offshore oil exploration?
656 2018-04-17 22:36:41 A politician can pay for all their promises by "finding efficiencies" as effectively as a snake oil can cure all your ailments.
657 2018-04-17 22:36:40 If Pandora's idea of a hipster cocktail party is a 3play of Superstition, Beast of Burden and Nina's Feeling Good, then pass the beard oil and some farm-to-table quinoa.

664 2018-04-17 22:35:24 It is now official! In 1956 the race track was called Lansing Speedway. That changed to Spartan Speedway in 1960. Now today, the track is known as Corrigan Oil Speedway. Track owner Jim Leisure is pleased to announce the partnership with #CorriganOil

He said he knows we take good care of our pets and not to worry. Also said coconut oil wasn’t good for her so that guy can suck it.

675 2018-04-17 22:33:35 @AhuacatlanOil great oil. Bottle is a piece of crap. Leaks and spills every time you try to pour from it. Will have to find another avocado oil.
676 2018-04-17 22:33:35 @Dave_Eby you claim Alberta would be breaking the law by shutting off oil to BC... but stopping the pipeline is breaking the law as well. Just remember you don’t represent the majority of British Columbians as per the last election #TransMountain

It's either he's surprised it tastes like PB because it has no sugar and oil or I once fed him menudo and it tasted like sinigang.
696 2018-04-17 22:30:07 Well done @Selby_FC it's was not to be the car park summed it up Farsley leased borrowed posh 18 plate coach while we had a old Wistow bus on veg oil or red, in the end @Selby_FC have great future and there own ground not a council house like Farsley come on aim for the playoffs
697 2018-04-17 22:30:07 You hit the nail on the head.  He looks like the man in the picture with her. LMAO they are laughing too.  MSM they get taken in by the snake oil salesman as long as it’s about President Trump.

699 2018-04-17 22:30:00 .@SenFeinstein & @SenKamalaHarris are strong protectors of the #CA coast against offshore oil drilling. We’re proud to have met w/their staff today to discuss our park’s future & our impact on California @IAAPAHQ #IAAPAAdvocates
700 2018-04-17 22:29:55 Yep! The olive oil is & will forever be the OG
701 2018-04-17 22:29:53 Pathetic politcing you mean the B.C gov which gets it oil and gas from alberta , and sask , but wants to take them to court over a pipeline that would benefit all of Canada ?
702 2018-04-17 22:29:32 いや、そもそも出勤できなくて困ってるんだけど

That's the most laughable analysis so far.

Vacuous, geopolitical BS & you know it.

A mindless, greed-driven Atlanticist wish list leaving the #US and #Israel dividing land, oil and profits, the spoils of their endless wars!

The concluding act?

Israel & US invading #Iran.
704 2018-04-17 22:29:17 Is it the oil cleanser too? I really want that. I like the ingredients
705 2018-04-17 22:29:16 Tomato, avocado, cucumber, green onion with olive oil and lemon dressing...should hAve added anchovies... #KETO

711 2018-04-17 22:28:41 And a very wise person once told me how to spot the difference between this type of oily sheen and actual oil - this one will break up when disturbed with a stick.
712 2018-04-17 22:28:37 Their olive oil is really good too!
713 2018-04-17 22:28:35 Yes it's about the oil. The oil America needs to control.
714 2018-04-17 22:28:31 Y'all, my BOMB ASS girlfriend took my car to get an oil change while I was at work and LET ME TELL YOU WHAT LOVE IS
715 2018-04-17 22:28:24 Jamaican castor oil saved my edges

717 2018-04-17 22:27:55 That's kind of what I thought tbh and  proff Sachs makes sense to me tbh. Tbh thought it was far more complex than he said. And re Assad   I don't know what I think with him conflicted. His People many seem to love him. Imo maybe oil a factor
718 2018-04-17 22:27:52 Also a lot of people are either not capable (ie math/physics) or not willing to retrain or relocate to make the big bucks. A job on an oil rig will pay big bucks but most aren't willing to do that for work.
719 2018-04-17 22:27:31 Palm oil rice straight up
720 2018-04-17 22:27:30 He's telling the truth...we know he never was for oil or pipelines..the proof restrictions. Trans Canada spent 1bil on energy east then walked away. This is next...
721 2018-04-17 22:27:07 @andygoldstein05 @jasoncundy05 believe it all or not I still have a betemax video recorder that I got for my 16 birthday  #OldSkool
722 2018-04-17 22:26:42 Your argument hinges on the idea that the oil price will forever remain low, which is both lazy and untrue. And maybe ask the UK government to stop giving massive handouts to the oil industry. Norway is still getting revenue, Scotland can too.
723 2018-04-17 22:26:41 US is the real terorist,  they created a false issues,  fake information ,  to divided world of moslem in some countries who are not block with them,  and start killing people for oil n other resources, Indonesia and Soekarno is one of the victim, for their false war,

732 2018-04-17 22:25:42 Not forgetting extra virgin olive oil 
733 2018-04-17 22:25:34 US is there illegal to start with. US should leave, the war is almost won and Syria can take care of itself. What's keeping you there? --> Israel and oil. US is willing to pay with US military  lives for that. Art of the deal?
734 2018-04-17 22:25:33 It is the fukcing OIL
735 2018-04-17 22:25:28 do I do a coconut oil pull before or after I drink this? is there a lemon-paprika chaser shot?
736 2018-04-17 22:25:25 Hey Dullard! you creepy vultures would also have us facing this mess. But with your brand of cowardly stupid you would be subsidizing the oil industry with Canadians tax dollars even deeper and ignoring reality. Just like dullards do.
737 2018-04-17 22:25:24 Sounds cool. What oil?
738 2018-04-17 22:25:10 Wilkinson,  your oil party lost the election. Calgary doesn't run BC anymore. KM wants out. No more oily grifters. BC not run by your foreign donors anymore. #asshat #pnpcbc #bcpoli #noKM
739 2018-04-17 22:25:06 Not fake. It does exist. Fabricated from whole cloth yes. Faked if you will.
We just need to get 30% of America to recognize a snake oil salesman when he appears and not vote for him.
740 2018-04-17 22:25:06 I did once in sch abt 5yrs ago when there wasn't g.nut oil and it had this local flavor 
741 2018-04-17 22:24:35 Did she hear about Alberta's latest oil leak into saltwater?
742 2018-04-17 22:24:33 Having multiply cars is fun until they all start to brake, need oil changes, tires, plates, ect
743 2018-04-17 22:24:29 i just celebrated penciling the first two pages of my graphic novel by scarfing down some soft cheese and olive oil crackers. 2 down 270 to go! 
744 2018-04-17 22:24:18 Clove oil smells horrible and I’m so upset I put it in my diffuser
745 2018-04-17 22:23:57 Curious so did a bit more digging. Can vary from less than 20% for Cdn syn crude to 50-60% for CA light crude ("Know your Oil," 2015, p 30, based on their assumptions about refining process). Kinda disconcerting that NEB is not distinguishing among very diff oil sources.
746 2018-04-17 22:23:55 Nope. 
Turned the page long ago, and am focusing on the team we will see next year.
There is a certain section of "Oil fan" that will cling onto a leg like a bichon.
Those people are also still pining over the loss of their girlfriend from Grade 9.

747 2018-04-17 22:23:54 It's also about the commodities being traded. Scotland has water, electricity, beef, lamb, poultry, whisky, and of course oil and gas in surplus. Where else is Brexit Britain going to buy these goods from if not Scotland?
748 2018-04-17 22:23:20 Caribbean geology students... I beg you listen to my wisdom... oil is dying. Pursue hydrology and Hydrogeology with special focus in climate change because the world won’t always need oil, but they will always need water.
749 2018-04-17 22:23:10 EZ shares +1.1%, US shares +1.1% as focus shifts to strong earnings reports (eg Netflix). US 10 yr yld flat at 2.83%. Oil +0.5% to $66.5, gold +0.1% to $1347.5. ASX futures +0.4%. $A 0.7768 as $US index +0.1%.
750 2018-04-17 22:23:00 Those side effects - pretty sure CBD oil does not have those.
751 2018-04-17 22:22:44 No we cant. We have fuck all revenue from oil and a massive deficit.  It would be a pretence to have an oil fund
752 2018-04-17 22:22:18 Big Oil + Pharm + NRA Behind closed doors.
753 2018-04-17 22:22:16 Trains carrying oil or flammable gases. Is this for Fullerton? Maybe they can have a train like this going through. 
754 2018-04-17 22:22:09 Germany's lack of access to oil ended WWII.
755 2018-04-17 22:22:06 He is not a thug, he is a dictators son who has been putting Syria on a path towards democracy until foreign jihadist mercenaries were sent in to weaken an ally of Iran & steal the oil & block the Iranian pipeline to the Mediterranean.

757 2018-04-17 22:21:52 As we suck water out of the Earth to extract minerals/gas/oil, returning it deep underground to never see the light of day again. And we're scratching our heads while covering our faces from the dust storms and wondering what happened? #idiots
758 2018-04-17 22:21:49 Jsuis sous of oil Jsuis boureeeeeeebma
759 2018-04-17 22:21:46 Ok. Indianapolis area, how much would a gram of Rick Simpson oil cost?  Just out of curiosity. I am not asking to find any.
760 2018-04-17 22:21:26 Ive spent an hour watching YouTube video tutorials on Oil Painting Tips for Portraits and learnt so much. Ima do my first portrait using oil paint tomorrow
761 2018-04-17 22:21:23 @talkSPORT @andygoldstein05 @jasoncundy05 Given the current table. If Chelsea finish top 4 and win Fa cup then what is the conversation. Spurs won’t win nothing In the next 18 months Harry Kane and many other will leave in subsequent windows
762 2018-04-17 22:21:23 Sorry did you mean vegetable oil?
763 2018-04-17 22:21:21 Simple. Think of all Canadians that work in the oil industry or did but were let go in the downturn. Now think of their families. The income our governments make off of the industry goes into healthcare and education for those CANADIANS.
764 2018-04-17 22:21:16 It's called Palm oil indomie like Palm oil rice
765 2018-04-17 22:21:11 Omg I just told her about it and she said she has one and she told me I can have it and she’s giving me the bottle of oil that smells good too :’)
766 2018-04-17 22:21:07 Mr. Oil is important need to take care of your car but put an oil change off for 2 weeks and why the fuck not drive the car like a race car even though it’s not a race car with a oil leak so that way the engine says bye bye but what do I know he’s the car guy. 
767 2018-04-17 22:21:06 If the fed government hadn't mandated rail must take crops it would be a crisis for the farmers pushed out of rail by oil tankers.
768 2018-04-17 22:20:56 I didn’t realise she was going to the airport. But you can take guns as checked baggage anyway, or just leave it in your car.
769 2018-04-17 22:20:52 Because there’s no oil.
770 2018-04-17 22:20:46 IDK. Look up Genie Oil. An Israeli company that Dick Cheney is involved with is drilling oil in the Golan Heights 'contested' area of Northern Syria. Those claiming there was an attack and wanting U.S. military to stay may have ulterior motives.
771 2018-04-17 22:20:33 In terms of population and resource Scotland is similar to Norway. And if Scotland was independent in the 80s then it could be enjoying a surplus with a huge oil fund. We can still build an oil fund, not as big, but still big.
772 2018-04-17 22:20:19 Tell him to add me - my name is “vegetable oil”
773 2018-04-17 22:20:14 They should've just paid for the oil and made those countries rich. The leaders of those nations weren't doing anything to their own people that they don't do.
774 2018-04-17 22:19:41 Peppermint oil on your temples and inside your nose. Helps me every time.
775 2018-04-17 22:19:37 It fries whatever is in it but the oil itself boils no?
776 2018-04-17 22:19:37 Jason’s vitamin E oil is a must in my skincare routine. When you stress or have anxiety your body is losing the essential vitamins your body + skin need. Replenish + take care of your skin!

783 2018-04-17 22:18:37 Balance, rotation, alignment and oil change. I feel so much better now.
784 2018-04-17 22:18:13 I need to get my oil changed 
785 2018-04-17 22:18:00 The other day I got shitfaced (which doesn’t happen often) & Devon took complete care of me. Then the next day, he took my car to get its oil changed. I don’t deserve this man.. 
786 2018-04-17 22:18:00 Please enlighten us how you make it without using oil daily?

So oil from other countries is better? Countries we buy from do not match our regulations

Regulations that protect workers and environment

Unlike Saudi Arabia we actually employ women in the oilfield.
787 2018-04-17 22:18:00 Okay it’s complicated 
Real oil or pure oil boils above 300 degrees
788 2018-04-17 22:17:53 Andy: your Con government routinely subsidized the oil industry to the tune of $3 billion/year.
The oil industry wouldn't exist if it couldn't suck at the taxpayers' teats.

793 2018-04-17 22:17:20 3/ about defending Tesla. If a team is trying their damn hardest to make products that reduce pollution & dependence on oil then I will support them. If you try to do something similar or anything else that is important then I will also support u as well. Won’t treat u like diety

799 2018-04-17 22:15:45 why would anyone changing my car's oil need to roll down the window...I guess now I am going to be driving with a plastic bag for a while.
800 2018-04-17 22:15:35 Norway is unique, it has a massive oil fund worth around one *trillion* dollars. It can afford a surplus.
801 2018-04-17 22:15:22 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
802 2018-04-17 22:15:20 So you don't know but yet you clearly believe bears are making all this stuff up for profit or maybe to benefit oil corps?... All this noise over a car company...

803 2018-04-17 22:15:14 Someone pls teach me how to change my car’s oil and wheels you know just in case

822 2018-04-17 22:12:04 The trick is to add a little more olive oil than you think you need. Then if you're like my you'll be scraping the pan with crusty bread to get every last bit of deliciousness.

829 2018-04-17 22:11:48 need me some peng beard oil
830 2018-04-17 22:11:48 Oil is produced to meet demand, so only DEMAND-SIDE interventions will reduce emissions (such as an ETS, like we have). Supply-side interventions such as bans achieve nothing except to mean someone else will produce it instead - no emissions reductions at all!
831 2018-04-17 22:11:37 Citizens are equally aware of factors that could affect those indices. Also, they could see the present conditions of oil producing nations that wasted their earnings during the immediate past boom and were not as lucky as Nigeria to have a PMB. Venezuela readily comes to mind.
832 2018-04-17 22:11:29 LOL, is that all you got? LOL! Did i hurt your feelings? Looks like oil supporters get #Triggered when you oppose them. Truly sad. #ProtectTheInlet #StopKM #bcpoli #cdnpoli
833 2018-04-17 22:11:15 I believe that will be American Oil flowing through that pipe. The protests are funded by American oil, among others, so those are the pipelines they want. It's only Canadian oil they want to stop, not American oil.

We ARE getting hosed! If Trudeau and Notley gave a shit about us, gave a shit about the value of exports they'd mandate it be upgraded before it's shipped. 
They're so transparetntly run by oil co's that they're ready to spend tax money to pipe jobs to China.
839 2018-04-17 22:10:46 If they boil pasta with out oil or butter, don't eat their food. 
840 2018-04-17 22:10:45 I'm buying the sunday riley ufo oil.
841 2018-04-17 22:10:45 Has anyone in the #agtwitter tried a product called Fulvex by Bioflora? It’s a fulvic acid added into liquid starter and used in post app gly. Snake oil or no? Saw some trial results and they were impressive, but need more reliable info.
842 2018-04-17 22:10:40 Obviously it is to maintain and grow the USA’s oil interest by suppressing ours.

850 2018-04-17 22:09:54 “The scarcest resource is not oil, metals, clean air, capital, labour, or technology. It is our willingness to listen to each other and learn from each other and to seek the truth rather than seek to be right.”

851 2018-04-17 22:09:15 Somehow oil got on and ruined 3 of my sweaters and Cody’s response to it was “i’ll buy you new ones but that’s what you get for dating terp daddy”   lmao fuckkkk
852 2018-04-17 22:09:12 Thanks Luke.
If the SDR comes into play, does the holder of critical natural resources (oil, coal, gas) become the new king; replacing the current king of printing $ to pay down national debt?
853 2018-04-17 22:09:11 Burning the midnight oil = working your ass off until deep in the night. Not sure what: "We are burning the midnight oil to burn the midnight oil." means? @elonmusk
854 2018-04-17 22:09:09 Ugh I know, but a $135 oil change and tire rotation from the dealership makes it tempting. I’ve never been since I got my car new tho
855 2018-04-17 22:09:04 We just had the midnight oil on 58
856 2018-04-17 22:08:55 Coconut oil comes in two forms: virgin tastes like coconut; refined has the flavor removed
857 2018-04-17 22:08:52 I see you blocked me on Facebook.  Don’t really like anybody asking awkward questions do you?  I put it to you that you are nothing more than a charlatan, a snake oil salesman.  You are (to put it succinctly), a con man.
858 2018-04-17 22:08:39 Be careful there Rob, he may be leaving out the specifics of the wrestling match... never know if it involves nudity and baby oil.... just saying...
859 2018-04-17 22:08:38 It was caused by Obama and Bush theft. How terrible that it was put on us while they walk away free with our money. Bush used 911 false flag to steal it and get the oil fields of Iraq. Obama just stole it period. He had properties and in foreign lands waiting for him.
860 2018-04-17 22:08:38 we started treating Charly with the cannabis oil. we hope it would stop the spams and seizures... poor angel
861 2018-04-17 22:08:37 Well this day went to shit. Ordered a part for my truck but they didn’t tell me it didn’t come with oil pressure regulator and then they tell me they don’t make it anymore than I get home and my mom ran over Me and Hannah’s dog maybe a broken foot
862 2018-04-17 22:08:15 the US sits on a ocean of coal, a great source of energy that can also be converted into oil, gasoline and diesel

865 2018-04-17 22:08:11 @SecretaryZinke do you even know how to spell the word?
Only thing you know how to do is sell our public land to  your oil and gas buddies.

867 2018-04-17 22:07:46 They voted no because the sneaky @GOP put trashing our National Arctic Refuge in the bill with oil and gas exploration.
868 2018-04-17 22:07:38 That's what happens when a country tries to renege on a contract with the big oil companies. Would have been better off sticking to the original agreement.

870 2018-04-17 22:07:31 The Roman Empire had lead plumbing, China has air pollution, and the United States has Big Oil.  The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
871 2018-04-17 22:07:00 Hint: These Oil and Gas hacks "serious way" of addressing it is to gut regulations and do nothing while they deliberately ignore and bury evidence ala the tobacco industry in order to reap profit from human misery. #copolitics #climate
872 2018-04-17 22:07:00 Not sure how to make this clearer; Oil and gas caused Alberta and Canada to get large deficits and caused their economies to decline sharply. The so called "oil money" you claim helps the people led to financial ruin. #Busted #ProtectTheInlet #StopKM #bcpoli #cdnpoli
873 2018-04-17 22:06:48 A fun microwave cooking tip: take plastic cling film & stretch across a plate like a drum. Smear with cooking oil & place anything on it to cook. It will turn out crispy & also give you throat & mouth cancer as microwaves release free radical reactions from the plastic. Yum 
874 2018-04-17 22:06:44 Always does. And price traditionally floats more than the differential. But agree I don’t think global supply will fall any time soon. And demand should not expect major growth. Steel is forecasting 2.5% to 3% globally so oil shouldn’t be far off that.

877 2018-04-17 22:06:07 Pruitt and Zinke basically run hand-in-hand through the flowered meadows (Bears Ears, Bristol Bay, etc.) they've decided to sell out to oil/coal/uranium businesses. And Wheeler is skipping behind them, whistling while carrying the corporate lobbying picnic basket.
878 2018-04-17 22:05:59 - very disappointed that this brand of peppermint oil has less inside and it’s also weaker.
I need my whole room to be smelling of peppermint when I switch my diffuser on

881 2018-04-17 22:04:55 What do tRumpsters care.  They will cheer this snake oil salesman while all the rest of their teeth fall out.  But, they got guns!  Lmfao. Stupid is, as stupid does!
882 2018-04-17 22:04:48 Oil is fundamentally bearish to be fair.

885 2018-04-17 22:04:15 Meanwhile, another poll has the MNZGA Party out-polling all the parties currently in Parliament. Must be because of its manifesto to "make NZ great again", build a wall & make the Pacific Islands pay for it, & put coal & oil at the front of the queue.
886 2018-04-17 22:04:12 this morning the house smelled like stagnant pond water (because of my roommate) so I cleaned and put lemongrass essential oil in the diffuser. I swear to god immediately after she opened the door she coughed and gagged because of the smell.... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

892 2018-04-17 22:03:24 A lot of the job losses were due to the previous federal govt's. support for oil and Harper's voter base.. Manufacturing suffered under the Harper govt., Wynne and Trudeau are bringing it back, now that there is federal support internationally by the PM..
893 2018-04-17 22:03:18 They're both explicitly threatening to restrict the flow of oil through BC. Are they not? And both accusing each other (correctly, in my view) of flouting the constitution. Are they not?

901 2018-04-17 22:02:19 I started using the L’Oreal elvive extraordinary oil shamp & condi and it’s made my hair SO much softer and less knotty! They’ve just launched something new for long hair too which I’ve heard is fab!

903 2018-04-17 22:02:12 I forgot about that whole get oil changed thing. It's been rather a LONG time.
904 2018-04-17 22:01:44 Using @TheBodyShopUK Polynesian Monoï radiance oil after a shower has to be one of life’s little luxuries! #cantstopsmellingmyskin
905 2018-04-17 22:01:44 Meanwhile in France, he states his intent to phase out the oil sands. That’ll give investors confidence.  Pick a lane Trudeau!
906 2018-04-17 22:01:36 @MavisTire went in for an oil change 2 hrs ago. An incompetent ‘new’ guy drained my transmission fluid and now the whole shop is under my car and avoiding my questions. Who should I send the bill for my new car?
907 2018-04-17 22:01:33 The inventor of the Diesel engine designed his prototype to run on peanut oil but had to reconfigure it to handle gasoline, as that was what his investors wanted to use. It's why Diesel engines can be retro converted to run on vegetable oil today.
908 2018-04-17 22:01:17 Replying to @AndrewScheer   You cannot believe what Trudeau tells Canadians. You have to listen to his international speeches. He treats us all like fools. That is Trudeau's Canada. He wants to phase out the oil sands he tells France. That should really attract investors.

910 2018-04-17 22:01:10 My local Spanish seafood deli has switched from a Spanish mid-priced olive oil to one from Portugal, so I went online today and ordered some Carbonell extra virgin olive oil.  I left the deli with croquetas de bacalao, tortilla espanola, and empanada de tuna.
911 2018-04-17 22:01:09 It's not oil. It's the major expansion of Texas tarsands, and damage bitumen does. It will destroy our BC industries. And if past BC govt already got grifted goodies, too bad for the oil Co's. This is democracy. No more grifters in #BCpoli
Calgary doesn't own BC anymore #pnpcbc
912 2018-04-17 22:01:05 Yall i came to pick my boss up from the dealership from getting her oil changed and she had to clean out all the syringes from farm calls and i had to find a water bottle in my car for her to make it a sharps container.... the life of a vet man 
913 2018-04-17 22:00:56 If kinder Morgan does not go ahead bc is going to feel the pain. Oil gas and natural gas prices will make B.C. carbon tax look like a tax refund.
914 2018-04-17 22:00:55 Jiffy Lube forgot to put oil back in my wife’s car once. Haven’t been back 
915 2018-04-17 22:00:53 Even if that were true, a day without oil would come sooner or later.
916 2018-04-17 22:00:42 But bombs aren't free are they ,tax payer pays for those but corps will reap profits from the oil when they destroy a country sad eh  100.000  a bomb

 I went with the oil, balm and wash and purchased it by trusting the positive reviews and didnt try the free sample. YOU FOLKS DELIVERED!!! The product is the best and the smell is sooo good. Keep up tbe good work.
#YugeRatings 
926 2018-04-17 21:59:53 Okay, so this machine *does* turn plastic into oil but it doesn't work on plastic bottles, it can't convert that class of plastic.
927 2018-04-17 21:59:47 Keep crying and trying to use that sob story. All you are saying is that BC should roll over let #kindermorgan be built, and kiss Alberta fanny without consulting FN and  quash protests against big oil. The oil sector hurt the economy, not help it. #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet
928 2018-04-17 21:59:38 If you are concerned about the environment, you should have been awake when Harper dismantled the environmental controls to pacify the oil producers.

937 2018-04-17 21:58:28 we learnt in college way back in the 50ties that oil is the only chemical powerful enough to drive an engine so let's see what the hippy's have as an alternative

946 2018-04-17 21:56:42 It's not a law of nature that we have to stop using oil by 2035. It'll be a hard legal goal but we've handled big challenges before.

950 2018-04-17 21:56:11 What ties does the Koch Brothers have with Putin and Russian? I’m guessing oil, since Kochs own oil refineries.
951 2018-04-17 21:56:09 Food especially in Japan. Ambergis for perfume. Fat is rendered into oil for soap and cosmetics. Bones make fertilizer and glue. All these products can radily be made from plant based ingredients.

953 2018-04-17 21:55:53 Oil is a global commodity. It's true the US is producing at the highest pace since 1970, but OPEC in 2017 cut production by far more than the US can immediately replace. In addition, US exports of oil are at record levels.

962 2018-04-17 21:54:55 And about the living large, have you heard of the oil boom? A time oil was at an all time high in the 70s and the Middle East invested in human and capital development while our leaders were boasting that they had so much money the problem was to spend it.
963 2018-04-17 21:54:53 Another fun tip. You don't need 'microwave popcorn' err soylent orange butter bags. Take your favorite gourmet corn. Pour 1/2 cup into microwave safe bowl with a splash of oil or butter, cover w/ paper towel, and run until popping slows down. Season and enjoy.
964 2018-04-17 21:54:51 It always was about plundering Iraqi oil. As for the "fight against Daesh", don't we all remember how "Daesh" came to be - from the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), a group headed by Zarqawi, thanks to the illegal US invasion. The rest is SPIN and PR.

971 2018-04-17 21:53:41 @jeremycorbyn @JewishNewsUK the far left under momentum direction has stolen the Labour Party that most Jewish folks. Now it time to show who runs the Labour Party, stand up and be a leadership Jeremy  #Antisemitism #StandUp
972 2018-04-17 21:53:34 just woke up from my nap to see charlie eating coconut oil...
973 2018-04-17 21:53:31 Add to this equation: terrible economic crisis, collapse or the national oil company, shortage of basic products and increasing sanctions against high rank officials.

Chessboard is set. Pieces are moving.

978 2018-04-17 21:52:54 y’all i’m at the car dealership and they told me it’ll take an hour and a half to get my oil changed... that don’t seem right?
979 2018-04-17 21:52:54 *is completely out of oil and fully aware of it*
*is shocked and upset to discover I'm out of oil*
980 2018-04-17 21:52:41 Used an Alton guide, so that's where it came from!

I used the wrong oil, because it had way too low of a flashpoint and nearly smoked me out LOL
981 2018-04-17 21:52:37 " Alberta thinks a pipeline in BC would be hype, BC says nah, cancelled. Alberta got low key salty and said they won't give BC as much oil so the price of gas will become, like, SO extra. BC thinks its rude as hell and is gonna sue Alberta until they get woke " -@MillionsonX
982 2018-04-17 21:52:36 I mean a goat, oil, spice, pepper and onions can appease me as well.
983 2018-04-17 21:52:06 No joke I had the same thought. I was like oh this should be 30 bucks and they were like no you need special oil because of high mileage 
984 2018-04-17 21:52:03 she's only trying to make it a different way coz she doesn't feels lik taking veg. Oil. Lol
985 2018-04-17 21:51:55 Canadian tar sands is among if not THE dirtiest and most expensive oil to extract.
986 2018-04-17 21:51:55 It’s disgusting. I hate this state. I’ve got $800+ electric bills and I have oil heat. We better get and R gov I’m moving out of this state.
987 2018-04-17 21:51:48 my fiancé wants to make dinner for me tonight but he just called me and asked what he’s suppose to do. “want shrimp scampi? it says all I need is shrimp, oil and pasta” “does cornbread go with that??” help me lmfao

989 2018-04-17 21:51:30 The guy ringing me up for my oil change tried telling me the rest of my fluids haven’t been changed since ‘09 even though I had them all changed and got new tires when I stated leasing the car last February 
990 2018-04-17 21:51:16 US LEADERSHIP:  Your oil and defense industry profits are not worth the bloodshed and anger US policies create in the world. You wreck the world so only a few can profit while ignoring needed health and social programs in America and let citizens worldwide suffer! We condemn you!
991 2018-04-17 21:51:07 Trudeau needs to put his feminist non gender issues aside and grow a pair quit talking about phasing out the oil sands and do the right thing flex his little federal muscles and be a leader and get thus pipe line done it is the right thing for Canada  and Alberta
992 2018-04-17 21:51:07 Hahahahaah yeah you have a point lol
But wait you got me twisted, I don't use olive oil in 3asida and sweet stuff but I use it in almost everything else, as long as I can afford to buy it, keepin it a  
993 2018-04-17 21:51:04 It’s called oil of moneylaunder
994 2018-04-17 21:51:04 Kinder Morgan was having trouble raising the money even before the squabble broke as near as I can tell. It isn't clear there was a market for this oil, once Keystone was approved.
995 2018-04-17 21:50:59 He's no leftie. Lk all the other highly paid corp tool anchors he's pushing 4 war in Syria. The left is extremely anti-war. Have you ever heard him rail against fracking, big pharma, or big oil, or 4 universal health care and living wage? SMH. Lots of $ 2b made fr endless war.
996 2018-04-17 21:50:56 there is no ocean, only oil
997 2018-04-17 21:50:54 Another oil spill I guess.
998 2018-04-17 21:50:48 The utility of oil is underpinned by basic physics - nothing burns quite like it. Facebook is software; intrinsically synthetic, its utility is underpinned by market forces. I'd argue these are not the same thing.
999 2018-04-17 21:50:48 jordan complained that i’m wearing one of her favourite shirts but shall I remind us that she got an oil stain on my polo hoodie

1003 2018-04-17 21:50:31 Just helping BC out in it's attempt to stop the flow of Ab oil . All or none .
1004 2018-04-17 21:50:23 What is incredible is you are repeating claims that pipelines help people when it was oil and gas that gave Canada and Alberta massive deficits from falling oil prices. Howe does that help anyone? #ProtectTheInlet #StopKM #bcpoli #cdnpoli
1005 2018-04-17 21:50:20 I don't want oil in the ocean!
1006 2018-04-17 21:50:04 I thought we, the US, was the world's leading producer of oil. Supply up, prices down, yes?
1007 2018-04-17 21:49:51 If the US had long ago decided to make its oil wealth state owned, maybe we would have a trillion dollar surplus too. 
Instead the US went down the road  and is still in the grips of oil based corruption
1008 2018-04-17 21:49:48 Oil Ocean Zone is a good zone, you guys are just mean >:(
1009 2018-04-17 21:49:33 My cars dirty, I need an oil change my apartment is a mess, I have so much laundry to do, pretty much my life is A MESS! But it’s okay because I got a 90/100 on my presentation today so I’m content

1016 2018-04-17 21:48:12 #PnPCBC .  Since we are a trading nation .  Tankers are already using ports & oceans.  Oil already runs overland. We have a lot of precedent.   Alta already gifted $$$ to BC under Clarke.  It is much ado Im afraid.

1022 2018-04-17 21:47:26 Trudeau and socialism are convenient scapegoats for CPC. Conservatives who once said “Let the Eastern bastards freeze in the dark” also wanted to "control Alberta’s natural resources" and direct the flow of oil south not east. Wanting control is not Party-specific.

1040 2018-04-17 21:45:36 I still think it matters, but it begins to matter less.  Currency debt is denominated in would still be important - if it's USD-denominated, then China can't print USD of course, but CNY oil might theoretically begin to free up FX rsvs to backstop USD-denom pvt debts in extremis

1055 2018-04-17 21:43:57 i had some lib teacher in college back in the 90's saying that the oil production in chavezland was waning because we had reached "peak oil" (or whatever they called it then). I wonder why He is espousing to the youth of today
1056 2018-04-17 21:43:56 Fred, thank you to you and others who have partnered in this effort to reject a junkyard of used oil trains in the Adirondacks, threatening our Park's communities, economy and wilderness.
1057 2018-04-17 21:43:54 Idk why...but everytime I do something very adult - like get my car inspected, oil change etc... - I get this strange urge to tell my parents so they know and get some kind of recognition I’m really making it on my own haha
1058 2018-04-17 21:43:49 Thanks Ross. Your graphic shows the global overpricing by the OPEC cartel. If my industry did the same, we would be jailed. We do not deal in oil nor donate to politicians to garner protections.

1060 2018-04-17 21:43:43 Almost all those instances of ‘flaming taps’ are due to wells drilled long before any recent fracture stimulation. 

Once again, just about everything the public blames on hydraulic fracture stimulation is actually the result of other practices in oil & gas. Need to fix those!

1072 2018-04-17 21:42:52 Horgan wants to cut oil from his province, Alberta will comply as will Saskatchewan which opens the door for the liberal govt to take control of this countries resources. VENEZUELA

It is has a very homogeneous population, although that is changing with migrant immigration making up the bulk of population growth. It is also blessed with huge oil reserves that are mostly State owned.

1080 2018-04-17 21:42:13 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

1082 2018-04-17 21:41:58 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.

1084 2018-04-17 21:41:44 Don’t know why getting an oil change is weighing so heavily on my mind... I don’t have oil to change
1085 2018-04-17 21:41:41 I have 2 friends that have children with RETS syndrome.  Cannabis oil has been the only thing that controls their seizures.  Up until a year ago it was very difficult and expensive to get in Maine.  Now, its just expensive   Been a long time coming.  more research warranted

1104 2018-04-17 21:39:17 Unless it is against the national interest. Or there’s oil involved. Then Indigenous people do not need to be meaningfully engaged or heard. And probably not seen, either....
1105 2018-04-17 21:39:17 If Aquilinis and FN were willing to invest in Eagle (something or other) pipeline, why not a refinery which would deliver more permanent jobs?  Don't know if crude oil tanker ban on North coast would apply to refined petro.
1106 2018-04-17 21:39:15 Dirty oil money only favors the oil companies, not families or workers. Maybe Alberta should have tried taking a page out of Norway's book and saved their money instead of squandering their oil wealth. Cry everyone a river. #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet #bcpoli #cdnpoli #AlbertaWhine

1116 2018-04-17 21:38:19 This was part of a 'core sample' these are used to determine if oil was present in a certain area (block) If it is (and I know) I could then go buy shares in this (block) highly guarded under lock and key and even got a separate chopper

1165 2018-04-17 21:32:58 Sometimes I put it in a pan and pour soy sauce over it, like a decent amount so it gets absorbed,  and also a little oil, and then I broil it on high until its like kind of crispy on the outside, kind of brown, and then I stir fry veggies and make rice and put them all together:)

1206 2018-04-17 21:26:58 Oil/gas exploration + extraction is an attack on Indigenous sovereignty + environmental hazard. As extraction becomes increasingly more invasive + more pipelines burst, we need to say no to companies like Kinder Morgan + rethink the consumptive mindset that oil extraction demands
1207 2018-04-17 21:26:52 Where is environmental protection and rule of law when you are forcing many BC FN's into allowing a foreign oil company to violate their territories?
1208 2018-04-17 21:26:51 The US public & politicians, have embraced expanding oil and gas industry & removing any environmental restrictions to oil drilling and production. Pruitt is still in office because he's dumping all environmental controls. Dems out to lunch while big oil runs the place.
1209 2018-04-17 21:26:44 @EPAScottPruitt So you mean they can pollute all the water right Scotty?  That way we can eat coal, drink oil, breath toxins, and drown in polluted water, while you spend us broke.   Great job Scotty, between you and Donny the flat earth really will look like a flat rock!

1220 2018-04-17 21:25:08 The other thing of note...so let me understand.She’s going to turn off all supplies of gas and oil to B.C? and which Alberta oil producing executive is going to support that?Needs to be a not insignificant reduction in production to offset that reduced shipments to BC. #basicmath
1221 2018-04-17 21:24:59 The thing is... Nothing is going to make sure shut her hole... Any of them.. Shove millions in any hole you want to... She will only want more... I moved on... I literally dont care about this trashy whore..

1224 2018-04-17 21:24:25 In this matter, the NDP coalition is being being run rough shod over by Weaver and his Green party threats of non confidence. The hard core opposition will not listen to the facts, one of which is we'll still need oil while we make the transition to greener alternatives.
1225 2018-04-17 21:24:18 Also ma and I just vaped oil and drank travel vodka.
1226 2018-04-17 21:24:17 Is it wrong of me to sometimes only think of all the ways I could ruin a specific person's life? Granted they were a terrible person to me my entire young life, and I never talk to them anymore. They're blood to me but makes me wish it was oil, that's more flammable.
1227 2018-04-17 21:24:07 Preach.
1228 2018-04-17 21:23:57 Great for America.  Now we export oil, before we had to import it.  
If they were paying 25 billion like you said then they were be gouged.

1230 2018-04-17 21:23:45 It just occurred to me that half this town is probably using CBD oil to quell anxiety & to have better focus in order to complete overwhelming tasks.
1231 2018-04-17 21:23:41 They have rights but they chose dirty oil money instead of standing up for the environment and their people's rights. Face it, BC doesn't want tar sands on our coast or #KinderMorgan. #Alberta is being selfish and acting like a spoiled brat. #ProtectTheInlet #StopKM #AlbertaWhine
1232 2018-04-17 21:23:41 Is he helping end a war that has lasted 70 years?  Americans are lucky to have him.  Our PM is in France promoting ending oil production in Canada while funding a $300K study on why the oil industry is suffering.
1233 2018-04-17 21:23:37 Not just essential oils, MLMs/Pyramid Schemes in general but the essential oil one really bothers me because the people slinging it think they know more than doctors. Some essential oils can actually be harmful if used incorrectly and in general shouldn't be used on kids.

1240 2018-04-17 21:22:37 So the @NHLFlames hit the panic button today but everything in Oil Country is good?? WTF
1241 2018-04-17 21:22:12 If you're not tree nut allergic, I've found the best vegan butter sub is coconut oil. It gives things like cake and muffins such great moist texture.
1242 2018-04-17 21:22:04 Besides, what Jimboman said in his toilet pondered EIA analysis is correct. We're not going to get export numbers like that again. Refinery won't be as high as last week. This could easily be a build of a million :)
1243 2018-04-17 21:21:53 Gaining traction but i believe we are not yet ready. So many unanswered questions especially to do with oil Vs environmental pollution... .
1244 2018-04-17 21:21:09 It will affect every business in Canada , not just the oil industry. Why can’t ppl see that?

1246 2018-04-17 21:21:02 I just got charged $70 for an OIL CHANGE because I drive a boujee car but the little nugget just asked if he could grease my door hinges and fill up my tires so I guess.
1247 2018-04-17 21:21:00 People think coconut oil helps everything in the world. Dry skin? Coconut oil. Dry hair? Coconut oil. Scars? Coconut oil. Sun damage? Coconut oil. Broken heart? COCONUT OIL

1258 2018-04-17 21:19:11 I’ve been watching Doctor Who with my dad and he was trying to remember Davros’ name and what the Daleks are called and he was just like “you know... the donkey Kong guy who created the oil can creatures...”

1260 2018-04-17 21:18:52 Taxpayer money flowing to oil companies is just fine with the base.
1261 2018-04-17 21:18:40 Ah, that is why Saudi is so quick to want "stabilize" Syria… so that they can build pipeline for Qatar to supply South Europe w/ fuel. Not likely Putin is concede gas line monopoly to Saudi or Qatari. Entire war is about oil, not about Bashar al Assad, but everyone knew that.
1262 2018-04-17 21:18:32 There wouldn't a problem in the Middle East of they didn't have oil! Poor buggers!
1263 2018-04-17 21:18:25 how did u cook it? i usually fry plain tofu in a bit of oil, & use cornflour as a batter, just makes it nice & crispy!! then i add it to my stir fried veg & sauce & mix it all together! cooking tofu took me ages to get used to lol but v tasty when u find a technique u like 
1264 2018-04-17 21:18:13 So I got a mix of olive oil and coconut oil on my glasses lens and it irritating me cause it won't come tf off

1267 2018-04-17 21:18:07 lol nothing makes me feel more like an idiot than getting my oil change like hi I know nothing about my car just pls change the oil so the little diagram goes away
1268 2018-04-17 21:17:58 Define safe.
Is it death and destruction? Is it amount of oil released? Is it land area or water volume contaminated? Is it habitat destroyed? Is it CO2  emitted?
Crude is nasty stuff, destructive when it spills into the environment, and toxic to humans and animals.

1269 2018-04-17 21:17:34 living right on the water of the burrard inlet... the idea of a spill/leak from the KM pipeline makes me sick. it'll spread right to the duck nesting area across the road and cover everything, the docks will have oil stains
1270 2018-04-17 21:17:34 My goal at Rezzed wasn't to drool over games, but if I had to choose my game of show, it would definitely be Disco Elysium. I'm awed by how bizarrely well everything fits together in that game. From writing to the oil paint art, it's insane.
1271 2018-04-17 21:17:26 #pnpcbc y' all eat some BC oysters and worry about an oil spill that might never happen and is the safest way to transport oil

1273 2018-04-17 21:17:18 Those who would give up essential Icthyocentaur, to purchase a little temporary Belgian and French ale, deserve neither Olive oil nor Fruit preserves.

1275 2018-04-17 21:17:07 Thinking about it, last week the EIA gave us more of a build than the API. This can easily be a million build in tomorrow's EIA. But there seems to now be demand for gasoline. I'm betting on a small build for tomorrow :)
1276 2018-04-17 21:17:01 I am sure she did... I don't really care... Everyone is unfaithful these days.. Its the in thing to be.. I don't care who POTUS is pounding.. As long as he is happy.. I don't want an anxious old man with nuke codes.

1289 2018-04-17 21:15:23 Tried ours for first time today thanks to @EgerCraig. Did a really good job on dirt and oil but was a little week on the bird shit. Need to start feeding our sparrows something different #stickyshit
1290 2018-04-17 21:15:22 Correct. But you still came to the wrong conclusion nonetheless
1291 2018-04-17 21:15:15 Mayo is egg and oil. Aioli is garlic and lemon and egg and oil. Vinaigrette is acid and oil. Muffins are flour, sugar, eggs and oil. These things are basically all mayo, I guess.
1292 2018-04-17 21:15:13 Well, i would have selected the great cormorant  bird... Always lacks oil, highly competitive and pretty invasive. 
1293 2018-04-17 21:15:07 You really can't get that from photos-which can be helpful but again those details are really what makes painting whether oil watercolor or acrylic work. Plus then you have to go into how your paints even work because even the colors you mix from have their own textures too
1294 2018-04-17 21:15:02 no not a smoker mate , tried cbd drops orally but decided to try vaping the oil , bought a cbd pen to smoke the oil but its shite ,hence looking for a decent vape
1295 2018-04-17 21:14:55 I bought canned oysters, sardines, and tuna in oil for my stray cat buddy. This cat’s gonna be livin high on the hog next time he/she comes along.
1296 2018-04-17 21:14:54 Felix, we are very sorry to hear about the oil and fuel concern on your CR-V Have you been able to speak with a Service Manager at your Honda dealership to discuss this further? Please feel free to DM us if you have any other questions or concerns. Thank you. ^FC

1302 2018-04-17 21:13:55 Oil prices are helping Euro as well.  You are right.. Gossiping/headline risk are for the yentas/day traders.  Your charts and commentary are great.. Keep them coming!
1303 2018-04-17 21:13:50 If they attack Iran so Iran would attack Israel and the oil rich gulf states, that would be a disastrous war.
1304 2018-04-17 21:13:47 Trudeau has failed to address the  pipeline opponents concerns about an #oilspill on the B.C. coast.  Kindermorgan said, once the oil is on the tanker at #WestridgePort, it becomes the responsibility of the shipping company,

1306 2018-04-17 21:13:37 I really like my skin to be dark and brown as hell. People would judge me if i used sun tan lotion tho so i just lather up in baby oil before i go out in the sun.
1307 2018-04-17 21:13:31 @BradWall306 , @DonMartinCTV #cdnpoli
So BC says it's illegal for Alberta to limit oil flow in a pipeline, but BC feels it's legal when they try to limit oil flow? #thisjustgotreal
1308 2018-04-17 21:13:27 Name calling and insults now? That just proves you can't handle a debate or criticism. Or the that you can't accept that fact that people in BC are not going to roll over let #KinderMorgan go through. Oil money would be dirty money. #ProtectTheInlet #StopKM #bcpoli #cdnpoli

1314 2018-04-17 21:12:25 Really how someone so stupid can get people to believe his bullshit just amazes me. Time to call confederation a failure and take our oil and move on.
1315 2018-04-17 21:12:24 I think what they mean is, “I wish your costs to make art were lower.” At least that how I feel when people tell that to me as a person that changes oil and works on cars. That being said I wish they would say something else like, “Let me buy that from you without complaining.”

1317 2018-04-17 21:12:06 Those countries have lots of money; oil. To take care of their vets and homeless. They have their own culture which doesn’t mix with ours... so it’s Best they go to the other countries who can better afford them.

1325 2018-04-17 21:10:41 Irony of ironies, this is being done by a government that asserts B.C. should have zero legal ability to regulate what comes out the same filthy pipeline, rail cars, and oil trucks that Alberta now hopes to effectively control in deciding what goes in them.
1326 2018-04-17 21:10:35 While I don't like gov't having this power, I suspect it will be short-lived (tho sure Kenney would keep it if elected!) and likely never used. Don't like this bogeyman shtick, and yes, Chavez is indeed dead. I did notice that Vz is actually importing oil - you see that?
1327 2018-04-17 21:10:34 I told you to change your oil!!!
1328 2018-04-17 21:10:29 She ask straight questions.  The gunshot residue on Blakes hands being minimal does come into question especially after being tested 2hrs later, and wet grass .
Also perhaps the oil found on the gun may have decreased the residue coming out of the gun also prevent finger prints

1351 2018-04-17 21:08:15 There is none. America gets very little of its oil from the Middle East. The US itself is set to have one of the largest oil reserves in the world. It would make more sense for Russia and they’ve been shown to be interested in that

All this to sell unsellable bitumen. Alberta can sell conventional oil and gas to Eastern Canada.  We all need a national energy plan.
1355 2018-04-17 21:07:43 That it's somehow perfectly normal for the west to topple foreign governments with the help of extremist proxy militias and oil dictatorships that are worse than the one they help the west topple, is totally mindboggling.

1375 2018-04-17 21:05:40 Oil and coal extraction are some of the biggest industries on earth, but you’re really claiming that solar panel jobs have more financial clout? Follow the money indeed. The big oil companies fund bogus think tanks and commission bogus research to fuel uncertainty and doubt.

1507 2018-04-17 20:50:25 I think we could have a ton of fun with a bottle of baby oil or honey
1508 2018-04-17 20:50:18 I hate having to get my oil changed. It’s 2018 my car should change its own damn oil
1509 2018-04-17 20:50:09 Wow this group supported these CHUMPS— Gruz and Texas Big Oil is to powerful for these farmers
1510 2018-04-17 20:50:08 That ok just deep fat fryer I hate anything oily in my mouth horrid, if I taste oil I become sick x
1511 2018-04-17 20:50:04 It cleans old oil, dirt, and pollutants off your hair. Vinegar does that- it's "clarifying".
1512 2018-04-17 20:50:00 A good point. 

Ironically they pump oil just half a mile from my house too. I stumbled upon it last week. Nodding donkeys and everything. Didn't half confuse me...!

I mean, not QUITE on the same scale...
1513 2018-04-17 20:49:50 Couldn’t help but notice how rapidly the excitement in my life has declined when I remembered I had an oil change today and got stoked
1514 2018-04-17 20:49:48 My old roommates would steal my beer. My current one steals my nice olive oil and idk which one is worse
1515 2018-04-17 20:49:47 Yes  Oil is on par with gas for me ...
1516 2018-04-17 20:49:47 Its amazing the CRUDE OIL in the original K-M pipeline is great stuff and powers BC ferries,planes,taxis,tugboats,trucks etc,but the same coming in the twinned pipeline is tainted,vile,obnoxious crude that is gonna pollute Burnaby forever.
1517 2018-04-17 20:49:46 Yes, I've noticed that the spatial analysis realm tends to be split into two groups who seem to split like oil and water - "ESRI is God and you should never question or complain about their products" vs "People who use ESRI products are sheeple."
1518 2018-04-17 20:49:36 Real support, not manufactured with Arab oil money like city.
1519 2018-04-17 20:49:30 Agreed, and in this particular battle, that's what Trudeau has done to BC. Campaign as an environmentalist, then sell our coastline to a Texas oil company. BC would love a national referendum on the pipeline, just as AB would like a provincial one on the carbon tax.
1520 2018-04-17 20:49:28 ex. HSBC laundering money for Al Qaeda and drug cartels, or Fannie Mae scamming people with predatory loans that helped crash our economy, or oil cartels hiding  their constant spills...etc. 
Technically you're right, corrupting government and cheating the people is a lot of work

1535 2018-04-17 20:48:13 @MoragMyerscough you work with an artist called Luke Morgan, did he live in Lincolnshire about 15 years ago.  Have found some of his oil paintings at a gallery in Cromer and was hoping to make contact.
1536 2018-04-17 20:48:12 The 13 years that education standards fell through the floor internationally, help him sell his snake oil to the young too.
1537 2018-04-17 20:48:08 However, between us, I'm new to western Canadian politics (relocated to Alberta from Toronto in 2013). Working in the oil sands region, I heard plenty of support for pipelines. But that Maclean's article demonstrates real enviro concerns that I've not seen properly addressed.
1538 2018-04-17 20:48:08 It's cute...

1549 2018-04-17 20:45:38 Quick Google search. Saudi cost per barrel...around 10. Oil sands break even cost...around 40.
1550 2018-04-17 20:45:35 Wouldn’t it be smarter to sell our oil and use the revenue to promote green initiatives at home?

1580 2018-04-17 20:42:42 If it comes our brown the oil is old or overused... if it comes out with a light color it was fried in fresh or newer oil. 
1581 2018-04-17 20:42:42 Been there, and done that. A guy showed me how to pump up tires in a rural community without a garage. Fridge compressor plugged in, will charge a tire full for years before lack of oil causes it to fail. Cheaper than those cigarette lighter compressors

1586 2018-04-17 20:42:32 Actually, oil investment will return in 2019 after the next election, when one @JustinTrudeau and @gmbutts will be seen at the nearest Employment Canada offices, applying for jobs as a drama queen, and whatever someone named Butts does when he's not screwing up an entire country.

1603 2018-04-17 20:40:51 This won’t affect just oil, why would any business invest in our “clown car country”.
1604 2018-04-17 20:40:44 OPEC tried to restrict oil to the rest of the world in the 1970s oil embargo. How well did that work out? Not well at all. It encouraged the rest of the world to find other sources of oil and OPEC lost major market value that they never recovered. History is a wonderful guide.

1656 2018-04-17 20:35:42 @RachelNotley sounds like if you cut BC oil/gas off, ur unemployment rate will skyrocket, you're making sure your party what ever it is, goes to the dustbin of history for another 40 years. Hey without fuel in BC gonna be hard to get you any freight to your province. #eattarsands

1660 2018-04-17 20:35:12 Average cost of heating a home €2,500? Where does this figure come from? Average heat consumption is 13,000kWh (seai) multiplied by a 6c unit rate for gas (which would be expensive) = €780. Oil €1,300. That’s average I think your figures are for one off large house.
1661 2018-04-17 20:35:11 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
1662 2018-04-17 20:35:00 It looks bullish BUT I don't trust those numbers. Let's hope API turns out to be like early last year........completely way off EIA.

I also believe all the chemicals in our water are toxic, only drink purified, and sugar is horrific for feeding disease.

1685 2018-04-17 20:32:02 Hi does anyone know how to bleed the lines in a seven thousand year old oil furnace
1686 2018-04-17 20:32:01 these statistics are misleading, sure Canada doesn’t have the population to polute like China or USA,but exports of our oil to those countries certainly adds to global green house gas emissions. At least be honest about your product,u aren’t exporting maple syrup
1687 2018-04-17 20:32:01 Oil. Lots of it.
1688 2018-04-17 20:31:39 Oil barrel at $80 and we are all happy together!!!
1689 2018-04-17 20:31:26 Interestingly the oil will still get to BC but by rail instead of pipeline. IMO there is way more risk in a train derailing than a modern pipeline spill.
1690 2018-04-17 20:31:22 It just popped for API. What were the numbers?
1691 2018-04-17 20:31:18 Everyone really should invest in a essential oil diffuser, it honestly is the best way to end your days and relax.

1727 2018-04-17 20:27:53 Measuring exported oil in kwh implies that we'd use it for energy. We won't. It's end-point may not even be power production (vs plastics etc) It's value to our economy is measured by volume not power dissipation. Viewing funds allotted to Solar vs Oil in terms of kwh is flawed.

1771 2018-04-17 20:23:35 What's crazy is I'm personally not 100% sold one way or the other, but I find myself defending nixing the pipeline just because there are so many Canadians who refuse to even entertain the idea that oil isn't the answer to our problems. It's anathema to these Canadians. Weird.
1772 2018-04-17 20:23:32 To some extent “popular opinion” is managed by the media.  There was scant coverage in Canadian media of a disastrous supertanker oil spill near China in January. Meanwhile Canadian media acts like environmental activists in BC are fanatical fear mongers.

1790 2018-04-17 20:20:54 Definitely. Not to mention that every single song in the soundtrack is amazing, can't think of a single one I don't like (even Oil Ocean was really good and I hate the original version). so even if some levels do take longer than others, atleast I can just enjoy the music
1791 2018-04-17 20:20:49 Lol they upstairs . Next time i hear it . Imma slide a note under the door saying “spray yo fucking bed with some oil shein so errbody & they momma don’t hear y’all having sex”
1792 2018-04-17 20:20:29 Ah but it is pure, just nut and salt. Thought it might appeal to the sugar/oil/refined avoiders.
1793 2018-04-17 20:20:24 How can you compare BC teachers salaries and quality conditions for child education to a Texas oil companies profits? Give your head a shake..
1794 2018-04-17 20:20:08 Girl I JUST asked my hair stylist about this! She couldn’t think of any product really as any shampoo and conditioner with sulfate will strip color, but she recommended some sort of tea tree oil? Scalp treatment? Idk I need to google it more 
1795 2018-04-17 20:20:08 Compare how Norway and the UK dealt with their oil boom. The UK gave tax cuts. Norway taxed heavily and saved the proceeds. Which country is doing better now?
Norway based their approach on Alberta and followed through. Alberta changed and followed the UK's approach.
1796 2018-04-17 20:20:04 More importantly why is no one talking about the selling off of berbera port and oil concessions all done surreptitiously to fill pockets of individuals.
1797 2018-04-17 20:19:50 I hate getting my oil changed
1798 2018-04-17 20:19:34 What sort of taste does your CBD oil have, is it similar to the holland & barret one??
1799 2018-04-17 20:19:30 You look like a rugged off-shore oil worker. Can’t believe I forgot to take a selfie!
1800 2018-04-17 20:19:28 This baby oil is about to roast my ass at the pool 
1801 2018-04-17 20:19:25 Brillant!
1802 2018-04-17 20:19:23 Then who do I buy? No one else wants to make electric as long as there's oil to bomb for.
1803 2018-04-17 20:19:18 Oil!
1804 2018-04-17 20:19:17 We’re bombing Syria for Syria bombing Syria. In the name of what? Greed. the military industrial complex and oil are America’s biggest money makers. We have no natural resources or raw material to export, so we create war.
1805 2018-04-17 20:19:14 I wanted to diy the cheap version of body lava with highlighter and baby oil and I broke off a piece of my Anastasia glow kit just for it to end up looking like shit 
1806 2018-04-17 20:19:07 These are OIL paintings?  My goodness you have a great talent!  They are exquisite!  I wish I had the. Only to offer to buy one.  They are absolutely stunning!  Brilliant!

1809 2018-04-17 20:18:55 Not at all, I love essential oils! I'll have to try it out. One of my friends made me a blend that helps a little bit, but I've never tried just straight peppermint oil. Thanks for the tip girl!

Amazing!
1814 2018-04-17 20:18:44 Jared says he loves Cas/Dean in Honolulu and he loves to bring it up to Jensen who goes along with it .  Jensen told the fans to write a fic about them on a oil rig and not to let them down so they like it. Jensen hasnt walked on because of that.  He promotes it too  Jared too

1831 2018-04-17 20:16:59 Beard growing oil anyone ???
1832 2018-04-17 20:16:58 So let me get this right,,B.C. does not want Alberta's oil,, so Alberta threatens to turn off the oil,, now B.C. is going to sue them ? Hmm lol
1833 2018-04-17 20:16:54 It is good stuff though, SO much better for you than olive oil and supports British farmers. x

1838 2018-04-17 20:16:37 Government need only ENFORCE THE LAW to demonstrate that industry can succeed without impediment by foreign funded eco terrorists. Their ulterior motive is to prevent Cdn oil & gas from international markets outside of US. There are a few US rich making a bundle on our resources
1839 2018-04-17 20:16:36 No one would even think of moving out of a house without a new place to move into, even a temporary one, the nation can't be expected to just stop using all oil and gas without alternatives in place. This is part of his plan to ram through CIB, which will sell our infrastructure.

1848 2018-04-17 20:15:39 No. Jonathan borrowed more and Nigeria made more money from oil sales under his administration. Go to the Debt Management office website for confirmation. Between 2012 and 2015 GEJ borrowed $5 billion USD. Buhari has borrowed $3 billion USD since 2015. Who has borrowed more?

1852 2018-04-17 20:15:32 I don’t want to because of the ice cream abuse and the coconut oil, but I’m taking your word on this guy Jamie. I hope you’re right.
1853 2018-04-17 20:15:29 It’s all they have left...they know deep down we are miles ahead of them. So they play bitter bingo 1) Bought the league 2) empty seats 3) oil money. Just repeat any of those..  Let’s not talk about all the money they have spent since 1992 or the dark finances of the Glazers
1854 2018-04-17 20:15:11 Naturally no countries prepared to step in, in Rwanda or Zimbabwe or any other country without oil. 
1855 2018-04-17 20:15:10 oil held better than i hoped. i was personally looking for $65 but we stayed above $66 so i lowered my full size to a small size... 
full size- 7-10k
medium- 3-6k
small - less than 2k
1856 2018-04-17 20:14:58 Trains?  Oh, u mean those things necessary 4 public transportation, but grossly underutilized in the US?  We are in desperate need of easily accessed, dependable public transportation thruout our country, yet we keep relying on oil & gas.  Sorry, I’m in need of an on/off switch.
1857 2018-04-17 20:14:55 Whatever he says is pandering garbage. I'll not stop harping on this point: The technology exists to lessen our consumption of oil/gas, if the Liberals were serious about "greening" our energy, they would have put those measures in place instead of begging for new taxes. [1]
1858 2018-04-17 20:14:53 Trucking firms are rubbing their hands now.... Transport costs for fuel go up, Vancouver harbour port to Alberta gives them a chance to gouge albertans! Not to mention the layoffs for the rest of the oil patch!    Lol go for it notley! I want to see this cluster Fk play out
1859 2018-04-17 20:14:50 No benefit for oil corporations in France, the UK, or USA? Banking opportunities if there's a regime change? Get some debt going to the IMF? No... It's just the Jews. Yawn. You're a simple minded sheep. Stay scared! Laters.
1860 2018-04-17 20:14:42 @armstrongcbc 
The pipeline is not vital for Alberta. Why do they not talk about selling their conventional oil and gas to Eastern Canada. Alberta and Canada desperately needs a national energy plan.

America is opening more land for drilling and soon will be a net exporter of oil and gas with reserves to last another 200yrs, fossil fuels arent going away and electric cars arent even close to being efficient
1868 2018-04-17 20:13:22 For God’s sake, ur not the only person who’s worked in the oil patch or in the oil industry or in a business reliable on the oil industry. There r many Albertans who have worked their collective assess off & r affected. U know what? Lots r just as angry at the previous gov’ts!

1880 2018-04-17 20:12:12 oil and gas is only 7% of the canadian economy, why is @CanadaAction only concerned with oil and gas and silent on the other 93% of our business and economy?

1884 2018-04-17 20:11:08 Agreed. Also looks like antioxidant-rich foods can help protect the endothelium, which is to say your olive oil with a salad isn't bad at all :)

1893 2018-04-17 20:10:11 Then u should put ur anger where it damn well deserves to be. The previous AB gov’t, Harper & the oil execs did piss all while the gravy train was @ their door. Then when the boom was over Prentice had the nerve to blame the AB ppl. U know, when he told us to look in the mirror?
1894 2018-04-17 20:10:08 But the increase in carbon would need to be resolved. Especially as I imagine Big Oil will be heavy investors.

1920 2018-04-17 20:07:31 Can you imagine if a “union” was doing something that might potentially restrict the flow of oil in this country? Scott Moe, et al would be blowing a gasket.
1921 2018-04-17 20:07:28 The only thing that will do is hasten Vancouver to bring in their oil and refined fossil fuels from Alaska, Washington State, and China. It's a dumb move. Others will jump at the chance of filling the void. Pain has to be applied in different places.
1922 2018-04-17 20:07:16 Things I have done today that are NOT my academic responsibilities:

- Worked out
- Washed dishes
- Took a shower
- Played w/cat
- Got hair cut
- Went grocery shopping 
- Washed car
- Got oil changed
- Ate McDonald's 

I am committed to ONE THING and that is not doing my homework

1938 2018-04-17 20:06:00 I keep forgetting the position is part of the oil industry!

1955 2018-04-17 20:04:22 Justin's oil strategy. 1 do nothing and hope it goes away. 2 don't make any decisions that way nobody can accuse u of making a bad decision.  3 leave country in times of crises, but say u care. 4 follow this strategy & you will  phase out oil industry.  Justin's on track

1957 2018-04-17 20:04:17 Why is BC importing refined petroleum from Saskatchewan?  How does that even make sense?  We have oil here.  We had refining capacity here.  It's not green to export dirty and import clean.  It's just being too precious to get our own hands dirty.  @jjhorgan

1963 2018-04-17 20:03:41 2/2 and if the AB oil is cut off to BC, @jjhorgan should cut off import of AB beef.

1976 2018-04-17 20:02:03 1/2 Ok @RachelNotley, your plan to cut off oil exports to BC is simply dumb. AB oil cos. will sell even less oil, and @JustinTrudeau this is an opportunity to really explore clean energy on a federal level. AB and Canada as a whole need to move away from this reliance on oil..

1998 2018-04-17 19:59:15 Taxpayers currently subsidize the oil industry by as much as $4.8 billion a year, with about half of that going to the big five oil companies—ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, BP, and ConocoPhillips—which get an average tax break of $3.34 on every barrel of domestic crude they produce.

2030 2018-04-17 19:55:08 If we restricted the flow to the US the lower mainland would have gas shortages.  Alberta supplies 14% of the oil Washington State refined to create gas and jet fuel.  Either way the lower mainland will be paying higher prices.

2041 2018-04-17 19:54:10 To me this is particularly outrageous coming from Russia, precisely because I expect higher moral standards from her.

2044 2018-04-17 19:53:48 This just plays into what the eco terrorists want. Less oil to the coast from Alberta. Just means more North Dakota oil will flow to the Burnaby refinery. Gas prices will spike and then fall when they make adjustments to who is the supplier

2048 2018-04-17 19:53:02 Well, it did jack up oil prices for a week or so.  SA and Russia happy!
2049 2018-04-17 19:52:47 If you don't know about this already, do some research on:
Genie Oil and Gas
(GOGAS).
- Especially who's on the Strategic Advisory Board.
2050 2018-04-17 19:52:45 How does oil get into BC now ?
2051 2018-04-17 19:52:39 Between my hair oil & biotin pills my shit growing hella fast 
2052 2018-04-17 19:52:36 let me warn you, when those politicians give you those items to gain your vote remember that Rice and that Vegetable oil will not feed you for their whole tenure. 
2053 2018-04-17 19:52:32 Just got hit in the eye with sizzling oil 
2054 2018-04-17 19:52:13 Thank you so much @keslupo and @chickenhsebooks for the completely uh-may-zing hamper of Greek honey, organic extra virgin olive oil, halva and balsamic vinegar. So thoughtful of you 
2055 2018-04-17 19:52:08 In Canadian waters, the tanker owner is responsible for pollution damages from oil spills. owner of the oil, pipeline or terminal is not liable for the spill and does not have to pay for the cleanup, compensation or natural resource damages. Sounds fair?!
2056 2018-04-17 19:51:49 I think it’s the timescales that are largely to blame for this, combined with the uniqueness of our situation, when a once in a 100 years’ investment coincided with the arrival of the oil money swamping the league.

Many younger fans just cannot fathom the nature of this change.
2057 2018-04-17 19:51:45 I think I need an oil change *continues to drive cus it has to wait until Friday because that’s pay day* 
2058 2018-04-17 19:51:32 You are so wrong. You forgot the word temporary! And according to the CBO most Oklahomans will be paying more in taxes in 5 years while your oil company cronies will be high on the hog both business wise and personally. Fact! Only the Galardians will prosper.
2059 2018-04-17 19:51:30 But this oil field money is going to help me buy all new equipment... So I can’t complain... just mad people stole my shit!!!
2060 2018-04-17 19:51:24 We’re trained to remain calm but afterward when considering all that could’ve happened it can rattle you. Incidents that come to mind are, landing on I-24W after losing oil pressure, bird strike caving in the windshield, losing power shortly after takeoff etc
2061 2018-04-17 19:51:16 In the last few days I set fire to my roast chicken and dropped duck in burning hot oil on my foot. I can confirm (again), that I hate cooking 
2062 2018-04-17 19:51:13 All is fine and dandy when the oil industry is booming. But, basing every year's budget off of anticipated funds isn't prudent. As a citizen, I can't base my spending off of bonuses that I may or may not receive. Be smart with what you have.
2063 2018-04-17 19:50:41 U.S.= oil company with an Army. #USInSixWords
2064 2018-04-17 19:50:20 Buy 3 spaghetti at 600,smoke sardine  fish 400,pepper 100, tomatoes 200, ugu leaf 50,other seasonings 100... I have G. Oil and gas to cook it in less than 25 minutes... Food is done
2065 2018-04-17 19:50:18 Isn't it sad that oil and water don't mix with each other even though they've got so much in common
2066 2018-04-17 19:50:08 Isn't this lovely? Particularly stunning in the dark frame. 

Good night. Sweet dreams xx

Wallflower. Oil on board by Grace Schlesier
2067 2018-04-17 19:49:56 Used to change my own oil and put in new plugs!
2068 2018-04-17 19:49:56 I heard changing the oil on ur car is bad for it because you should never change the oil the car came with when it first came out the factory
2069 2018-04-17 19:49:52 It’s not like crude is getting sour in ground Current motive power tech is only 20% efficient. 80L out of 100 are going as waste. Once grip of oil lobby is loses innovation will be propelled. With 80-90% efficient engine Alberta can sell oil for $20/L no one will complain
2070 2018-04-17 19:49:46 Its fun to live in fantasy until reality is angrily stomping towards you
2071 2018-04-17 19:49:42 as much as i can’t stand laura lee’s “oil” headass, her lip fillers look really good like i didn’t even know she had them
2072 2018-04-17 19:49:20 I hate working in the oil field...
2073 2018-04-17 19:49:17 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
2074 2018-04-17 19:49:08 Amen, sister! NONE of the left has ANY credibility, as far as I am concerned! We both will ALWAYS B pros, in our respective lines of work, Rhonda. We both burned too much midnight oil to get here!
2075 2018-04-17 19:49:03 Oiled my scalp with a coconut,tea tree, and argon oil mixture and it feels amazing..
2076 2018-04-17 19:48:54 Woo that picture just told me to go oil my body
2077 2018-04-17 19:48:51 uh huh, because what they were peddling was snake oil...
2078 2018-04-17 19:48:41 I WISH I NEVER TOOK MY ART PROJECT SERIOUSLY BECAUSE I DONT WANT TO FUCK IT UP WITH OIL PASTELS
2079 2018-04-17 19:48:39 wow I’m a whole ass adult I filed my own taxes and finished my class and got an oil change and woke up before noon I’m thriving
2080 2018-04-17 19:48:38 No National Queen Show contestant could possibly be worse than the girl they asked about Oil Down, a tragedy
2081 2018-04-17 19:48:30 Gartman should use Cohen to bury his past #oil calls.
2082 2018-04-17 19:48:30 Crude oil
2083 2018-04-17 19:48:29 If I had 2 billion dollars I'd think seven generations ahead before committing to oil extraction... #ifihad2billiondollars @JustinTrudeau #StopKM
2084 2018-04-17 19:48:20 WHERE IS the SNP’s financial case for separation ?  Whit’s the hold up ?  

Surely it should be easier to put together given the paragraphs on £BNs on oil revenues have been removed ?
2085 2018-04-17 19:48:16 2/  #Daesh regularly Traded Oil across #Iraqi #Syrian & Turkish Borders on the Black Market, but there are NO Known Times they Traded with #Erdogans #Turkish Gov.
#YPG #Kurds & its affiliate #PKK Terrorist Group have Assisted #Assads Regime in Killing & Ethnic Cleansing in #Syria
2086 2018-04-17 19:48:12 Good point ... Tho I'd also note that CA is a MUCH bigger producer of oil/gas than Colorado, which I don't believe cracks the top 5 producers, correct?
2087 2018-04-17 19:48:07 I just use baby oil
2088 2018-04-17 19:48:07 Casually singing Stacy’s Mom with my 2 managers while working on 3 oil changes at a time
2089 2018-04-17 19:48:00 Try Castor oil and Morrocan Argan oil. Make sure it’s cold pressed and organic.
2090 2018-04-17 19:47:49 Yes I was going to say Kale crisps, the kids love them. I just put salt and olive oil on them
2091 2018-04-17 19:47:28 Uh, George's boss is married to Susan Rice.
2092 2018-04-17 19:47:27 Lmao if you bring your car to dealer for oil change
2093 2018-04-17 19:47:23 For the time being, no more war, no sanction on Russia plus increasing oil rig :)))
2094 2018-04-17 19:47:22 me, shoving fish oil pills down my gullet and chugging apple cider vinegar by the bottle: make me happy and skinny you cowardly potions
2095 2018-04-17 19:47:08 Come on bro without the money Teams like City and United would be nowhere near where they are .. City wandered through the desert for 40 yrs before they got that Oil money , Madrid , PSG I can go on and on let’s not be delusional here .. for the record I’m A United fan
2096 2018-04-17 19:47:07 Hope they include our indigenous peoples. Often do not understand due to cultural differences. Oil and gas companies have been teaching their employees for decades for inclusion. Starbicks needs to look to their programs. ie BP,Conoco-Phillips
2097 2018-04-17 19:46:37 Trying to slick a can of oil, who you think you fooling?
2098 2018-04-17 19:46:27 Many people left India four years ago when crude oil price was low
  and disel price was low

Now crude oil price is low
But disel price is high
Car companies will Cal and ask
Do you want new car ?
 But nobody is interested
Because of high disel price
Jai Hind
2099 2018-04-17 19:46:22 Lots of people change their own oil.
2100 2018-04-17 19:46:01 Because he has no oil and Islam is a religion of peace no idea how those people fell off the buildings
2101 2018-04-17 19:45:54 Honestly men will never understand what it's like to be looked at directly by old men & get sexualized in those small seconds damn I can't even get a oil change in peace
2102 2018-04-17 19:45:53 What happened to all that oil, why are prices climbing so much so fast. Why is oil at over $66.00 a barrel? Make oil companies rich again.The middle class got a few extra bucks in their pockets we need to get some of that money
2103 2018-04-17 19:45:39 Opinion including the best arms sales, cheapest animal testing, best oil investments!
2104 2018-04-17 19:45:38 Tea tree oil is so mnandi fir the skin but the smell. Yhuu 
2105 2018-04-17 19:45:31 I mean generally people don't change oil or fix their car they send the car to the dealer to for maintenance
2106 2018-04-17 19:45:26 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

2110 2018-04-17 19:44:59 Going live in five. Seeing a LOT of misinformation out tere about CBD and feel like clearing the air a bit. 

WHy does it work for some and not others, quality, isolates and snake oil salesman.
2111 2018-04-17 19:44:54 I totally agree with May beibng in bed with Saudis and Trump being fooled by whoever wants that syrian bank or oil or whatever the real reason for this attack is May needs to be gone already not a leader but we dont change anything 2 party system is so flawed never get it right
2112 2018-04-17 19:44:51 Lool. Buy an extra bottle of anointing oil or something. And fast too. 
2113 2018-04-17 19:44:48 Chopped in to small squares with tomatoes, onions, olives, olive oil, lemon, salt and black pepper and a toasted ciabatta. 
2114 2018-04-17 19:44:47 Do you really think that the leaders of those countries care about Syrians. This is about control of oil/profit..(2)
2115 2018-04-17 19:44:40 Translucent/‘colourless’ powder from any decent makeup brand. Oil controlling primer - (L’Oreal Infalliable!). And oil free sunscreen in this heat! But it’ll be the powder that’ll give the effect.
2116 2018-04-17 19:44:30 I was thinking about Russia getting control of their oil .
2117 2018-04-17 19:44:29 Lai... Lai...Stella made her money long before she was minister. Serious money in Land, Oil and Cash.Military Government was good to her but she has always been a smart woman.
2118 2018-04-17 19:44:27 I walked to Starbucks while waiting for an oil change and it feels so weird walking places it makes me uncomfortable :(
2119 2018-04-17 19:44:26 Females if you have good clean beaver oil HMU
2120 2018-04-17 19:44:12 Buying a tire,  oil change 
2121 2018-04-17 19:44:06 Certainly in terms of sustained inflation process. But in the cases, for example, of oil cities or others with sustained excess of local demand, a different range of inflation of national average can be verified.
2122 2018-04-17 19:43:53 this made me LOL!!! dude castor oil is the shit, i kid you not
2123 2018-04-17 19:43:51 Feeling proud to live in Somerville where TEN of our Aldermen have now signed the @NoFossilMoney Pledge! Big oil can stay out of our city cause these folks are standing up for our #climate, our democracy, and our generation. @SunriseBoston

2127 2018-04-17 19:42:59 Oh thank you ... .. I should remember to put repellent on before I go off out .. will try the tea tree oil 
2128 2018-04-17 19:42:47 Are you aware of 2 competing oil pipelines through Syria. 1 financed by Russia/Iran, 1 financed by US/UK/France ...(1)
2129 2018-04-17 19:42:47 Money and friends are like oil and water
2130 2018-04-17 19:42:46 Foreign oil for Quebec no energy board hearings no review no green peace no protesters hundreds of millions of tax dollars leave the country  yearly responsibly produced Canadian oil is blocked by a minority of people by double standard BC
2131 2018-04-17 19:42:44 Love their Midnight Recovery Concentrate face oil!
2132 2018-04-17 19:42:43 I’ve re-read and it enables the plastics to rapidly be used as other plastic products, I think.
Reducing the use of oil if I’ve understood correctly. 
2133 2018-04-17 19:42:41 Really , is that so! So basically any one can go out on TV and ask Washington to do something and those  douchebags do it anyway!? And what they get in return? 
Aha i know what: its called Oil , junior!
2134 2018-04-17 19:42:39 who need an oil spill ticket ?
2135 2018-04-17 19:42:36 This is a very good and very sad comparison. Reconciliation only works for oil companies. Ten years from now the oil will be gone. So will many First Nation children...
2136 2018-04-17 19:42:27 Nigga is preserving it more than we are preserving Oil in Nigeria
2137 2018-04-17 19:42:25 You don't know that it can't fill the gap. What we do know is that oil and other non renewables is causing CO2 to rise and temperatures to increase. What's the point of having a job but having nowhere to live. Think long term mate.
2138 2018-04-17 19:42:21 Clinton used his penis, Bush used a fale war for oil and big corporations profit for his family. Trump name one thing he did wrong in office?
2139 2018-04-17 19:42:18 Iraq was a tiny war that I supported then when I went to Iraq I realised I was wrong...we should stay out of the ME! An invasion of Syria would be a huge undertaking & the US wants the Arab states to do it...as they should! Don't confuse the issue with oil, Syria has less than UK
2140 2018-04-17 19:42:15 What’s the main benefit of a ginger oil? Healing? Sickness I guess... using oils again as need calm... and healing... lavender is on the go already

2142 2018-04-17 19:42:08 in oil & gas corporations, you'll need a minimum of master degree to work as a geologist. most of geologists at ExxonMobil have a PhD.
2143 2018-04-17 19:42:05 Unless they further restrict oil burning, next year the cars should be more fuel efficient, so 110kg may be enough
2144 2018-04-17 19:41:54 You want to sell your country you f***ing tool fine be my guest sell your country and its oil, but don’t you ever dare to think you can sell other ppl’s countries you disgusting scum.

F*** the Gulf.....Trump’s personal b****es.

2148 2018-04-17 19:41:27 California removed all employment opportunities for me in the early 70's with "Equal Opportunity" which meant if single, white & male = no job for you.
So I left & made a career drilling oil wells all over the globe from Louisiana. Now retired & have a nice place in a Florida.

2150 2018-04-17 19:41:10 It was horrid! Kids that didn’t have government childcare were using the streets as a slip and slide and thieves were scooping oil up all over the place to put in their cars. I saw cyclists lining their chains and gears too. Super bad scene.

Then we're gonna have THOUSANDS of pro-education people wearing free playoff t-shirts from the same company Weds night.
2168 2018-04-17 19:39:48 Is there a worse feeling than fish oil tablets repeating on you all day please

2171 2018-04-17 19:39:35 I find this rather disingenuous Mr Scheer. The PM has been very clear that for the moment the oil sands are required but that we need to phase them out over time. If your tweet was about what is the timeline, that would be a legitimate question. This is dumb base pandering

2182 2018-04-17 19:38:48 In September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals—an American football team that played in the United States Football League (USFL)—from oil magnate J. Walter Duncan.
2183 2018-04-17 19:38:38 Cummings is full of shit. This is noise. You guys are bad losers. Remain outspent leave. No one's opinions are changed by this Cambridge Analytica snake oil
2184 2018-04-17 19:38:15 So thanks to this "far sighted" govt we are forced to move to this unknown, unproven technology that could actually be worse than current gas/oil. Wow! Gambling on behalf of nxt generation.
2185 2018-04-17 19:38:09 What? They want BC to risk oil spills & will then limit our oil 
2186 2018-04-17 19:38:04 clearly i’ve been sleep on peppermint oil
2187 2018-04-17 19:38:01 He has been wrong for a long time.   Two years ago said on CNBC the age of oil is over.
2188 2018-04-17 19:37:53 That chain needs a drop of oil...
2189 2018-04-17 19:37:50 He is a tool of the Oil Lobby
2190 2018-04-17 19:37:47 Vapid sloganeering and broken promises go hand-in-hand. No relationship is more important to him that with Big Oil. It going on about our differences that makes the right-wing backlash stronger. 

If he had just said what he meant!
2191 2018-04-17 19:37:36 I won’t get my oil changed anywhere except @jiffylube #thebest #tulsahills
2192 2018-04-17 19:37:26 Why would anyone want to roll back clean water laws? (Besides big oil tycoons.)
2193 2018-04-17 19:37:17 No one is talking about subsidising the off shore oil industry though. They subsidise us through the payment of royalties and tax. If they want to provide jobs in a sunset industry, that’s their prerogative.
2194 2018-04-17 19:37:16 Solidarity!
Wait, this wasn't what you were going for?

If only you'd work with the Alberta Government to arrange the best royalty rates for citizens, instead of compete to drive the rates down in Big Oil's favour. That wouldn't help your real constituency & donors.
2195 2018-04-17 19:37:00 Mr Bridges is wrong about his view on Syria. I miss the "oil field" on top his head now he has ditched it.
2196 2018-04-17 19:36:57 "In 2015 election campaign, PMB and his cronies accused GEJ of scamming Nigerians through oil subsidy. 

On Dec 28, 2015 PMB said he was ending Fuel Subsidy. May 12, 2016, Ibe Kachikwu said subsidy had been removed"

2197 2018-04-17 19:36:52 I love working these midland flights because I have high hopes I’m gonna snatch up one of these guys working in the oil fields
2198 2018-04-17 19:36:35 Thru 2005 tdi needs no conversion to run on biodiesel (not the same as straight veggie oil.)  Newer (this looks 2009-ish) tdi models with common-rail electronic injectors can't exceed B20 due to hairbrained DPF regen scheme.  Ethanol in a modern gas engine is a software mod?
2199 2018-04-17 19:36:20 N1.4T spent annually on Oil subsidy, yet the Pump Price of PMS remains N145, while GEJ spent half of same amount & maintained d Price at N87. What an irony!

2200 2018-04-17 19:36:09 and low oil prices. If you just look back in history it’s generally been a pretty sticky group. And so the first thing that happens when you go through a bad cycle is that corporate traffic starts to turn off. That means that our opportunity remains and gets bigger.” $save

2202 2018-04-17 19:36:03 I prefer it & olive oil - think it’s all around healthier - mankind has eaten it for eons. Since the early 1900s, we’ve been inundated with contrived foods, especially the edible oil products & haven’t been the better for it - I try to eat whole, natural foods, smaller amts.
2203 2018-04-17 19:36:02 Bruuuh I’ll change your oil in 15-20mins max and I’ll take a blunt sesh as my payment. 
2204 2018-04-17 19:35:48 Only the narrow minded & shortsighted would want to turn the troops on its own people. Oil is a dinosaur technology, open your mind & join us in the 21st century where the future is bright
2205 2018-04-17 19:35:42 If the wheel isn't moving or it is making a noice while the car is moving my brada just go buy an a oil and pour it...That's the rule of luv

2207 2018-04-17 19:35:28 When you hungry growing up & food low in Th house.
Then you big sister slice those potatoes like silver dollars and put them in oil just to soften them up.
Ooooooweee
Hot on a plate with salt & pepper, maybe ketchup & lil mustard.
I was a satisfied child full on potatoes  
2208 2018-04-17 19:35:27 Innocent Biafran children what did they  or i did  to evil British government? I was amongst these children, racist empire who prefered Biafra oil to human life judgement day is coming on them very soon ISIS will soon take over their country
2209 2018-04-17 19:35:23 Both countries are off any travel list until this is banned. And no palm oil under any circumstances.
2210 2018-04-17 19:35:04 Several people in your replies have mentioned coconut oil and I know you love yourself so you would be wise to NOT slather your face w that. Clinique makes a great facial moisturizer for dry to very dry skin, but also look at Cerave, Argan oil or Rosehip oil for cheaper alts.
2211 2018-04-17 19:35:02 Chemo is not good. It kills healthy cells too and often people die. Try hemp oil. People will be against this but normal, as the masses believe chemo is the answer.
2212 2018-04-17 19:34:59 @SenJohnMcCain Did @realDonaldTrump blow up your chemical plants? Need a stray to get that crooked pipeline (the real war- control of oil again) deal Israel- Golan Heights. Ted Turner etal ring a bell? #TEPI Caspian Sea thru to Syrian port. Assad victim of globalist greed?
2213 2018-04-17 19:34:58 That is because they came from a non working nation that paid them oil money without working. Refugees will be a drag on all nations they live in and will drag them down over religion & attacks!!
2214 2018-04-17 19:34:58 Dear vegan YouTubers, stop "frying" your veggies in water instead of oil. Oil isn't bad. Oil provides taste. I'm not doing that steaming shit that you suggest.
2215 2018-04-17 19:34:46 this is just dumb if we phase out oil then no one will have Cell phones or Ipads or touch pads or lap top computers and T.V s  all made from oil and Clothes two
2216 2018-04-17 19:34:42 ...It's clear from my brief reading that all of these projects have their pros and cons and I can see why Trudeau might see Kinder-Morgan as the better of all options. It's a complicated business, as you Mr. Morgan, an oil CEO yourself, should know. A more honest...
2217 2018-04-17 19:34:38 The Eco nutters would never protests that pipeline- they need to fly around the world protesting Canada's oil and gas industry
2218 2018-04-17 19:34:32 Sometimes when I pray, I endeavor to thank God for the struggle, for the days when I had to bath with caustic soda, for the days I made soup with only red oil and vegetables.. and then I thank God for the life now, Just be grateful for whatever life you had dear...
2219 2018-04-17 19:34:31 They have oil in Korea?
2220 2018-04-17 19:34:20 You probably need a constant routine with it! It’s great for oily skin it’s tricks the skin into thinking it’s produced enough oil and actually stops sebum production

2223 2018-04-17 19:33:55 Subway employee just suggested I get the jalapeños under the cheese and oil on top before I toast it so it bubbles up. A true OG to the game I would’ve never thought of that.
2224 2018-04-17 19:33:46 not sure how to think about that.. It would be like the oil/coal industry buying up solar company
2225 2018-04-17 19:33:37 Oil???
2226 2018-04-17 19:33:21 As a voter whose sole issue was making sure EPA administrators could buy $40,000 secure phone booths to take calls with oil lobbyists, I think trump is doing a great job
2227 2018-04-17 19:33:18 USA over throws governments that price oil contracts outside of $USD. Taxes are required to paid in dollars. Creating markets for your currency is critical for adaption.
2228 2018-04-17 19:33:05 Problem is the biggest non-Slav dude is pissed as f**k since the Slavs are stealing their oil company and make their banks fail.

PLATEAU CITY. 1200ish cals (prob more—bad at counting olive oil etc). LOVE your advice. Did my calc (BMR 1551.35*1.3). How did you know how many cals he SHOULD eat?

If there was no oil then no-one outside of Syria would care.
Oh - also ISIS I suppose - no-one cared about Syria until extremists arrived.
But no-one cared about ISIS until they took control of oil fields in Iraq.
So oil.

2248 2018-04-17 19:30:05 Westminster has over 40 years near bankrupted an oil rich UK
Enough is enough,they have had 92% of scots oil revenues for 40 years and rebuilt London With it,
scots don't even have a motorway to the highlands.
They treat us like a colony and are shocked we want to leave.
2249 2018-04-17 19:29:41 But....how does that permit Israel to keep the revenue from the incredible yuge oil and gas fields of the Golan Heights in perpetuity?

2261 2018-04-17 19:28:04 Labour no way said that they were halting oil exploration immediately in their election compain, if they had of they would have lost a shit load of votes. Taxcindra said she would not  raise taxes, Lies, Lies, lies
2262 2018-04-17 19:27:58 Own our own oil and gas give the people of the country a share of it and maybe we could afford one. Instead of Norway owning our oil and gas and sharing the wealth with their citizens. Could be a start!
2263 2018-04-17 19:27:56 Coz the Saudis have oil.
2264 2018-04-17 19:27:55 So you have obviously stopped using anything that relates to the oil industry right? Like cars, bikes, food, phones, houses, furnaces, clothing? I assume you have?

2268 2018-04-17 19:27:19 You are impressed with boy blunder's blatant attempt to ingratiate himself to journos. It worked. How about that part of the speech where he said it will be a good day when Canada no longer produces oil.  Any red flags of concern over that?
2269 2018-04-17 19:27:16 get some decent clippers, mine came with some oil (not that I use it). Keep moustache off your lip to keep it more food free

2279 2018-04-17 19:25:48 On point, Tom. This is why they’re banned in the UK. They’re not a “news” organization; they’re snake oil peddlers.
2280 2018-04-17 19:25:45 It is outrageous that @JustinTrudeau and his cabinet are going to throw billions of public dollars at a Texas oil company working in a sunset industry contributing to climate change. And of course, Indigenous people get tossed aside for it. #KinderMorgan #ClimateChangeIsReal

2282 2018-04-17 19:25:21 I think Fran O'Sullivan has really lost the plot, describing @jacindaardern 's oil exploration ban as short sighted.  You couldn't get a more ethically futuristic policy.  Short sighted policies are those like National - rely on oil until you've totally destroyed the planet.
2283 2018-04-17 19:25:13 I used to struggle with this so much and then I started using CBD oil, you can get it from Holland & Barrett's and it makes such a difference

2288 2018-04-17 19:24:47 Pipelines are proven to be a lot safer than rail. The oil is going to be moved regardless. It would make sense to choose the safest way to transport it.

“Oil companies are furious! Get 70 mpg using this miracle trick!”
2294 2018-04-17 19:24:26 Doesn't that just prove my point? It's not about 'doing the right thing', it's about oil and self interest. Syria is the battlefield in a very messy proxy war and it will only get messier.

2299 2018-04-17 19:23:32 Surprised nobody has complained that an oil company made shirts advertising the earthquakes in Oklahoma (possibly) from fracking.
2300 2018-04-17 19:23:20 This is a good point.
I’m sensing they’ve considered this in their research, as they’re scientists.
I certainly hope they have. 
It seems like this accelerates the process for recycling plastic reducing need for further oil use in plastics.

2310 2018-04-17 19:22:19 Probably because we need their oil. Realpolitik is a bitch.
2311 2018-04-17 19:21:59 The only poll that matters will be Oct 2019 when CNDs country wide vote out @liberal_party. The liberals are literally creating a recession and killing any investment in our country not just in the oil industry either. Investments down 27% in 2017. 84 billion lost in investments.
2312 2018-04-17 19:21:56 Some of things replacing palm oil include dairy products.
2313 2018-04-17 19:21:48 OPEC controls the price movements it does not determine the price itself. The price is determined by supply, demand and speculation on the oil futures market.
2314 2018-04-17 19:21:45 What about the disregard for past environmental regulations? Drilling for oil legal now off the US coasts except for Florida? Bringing back coal? There has to be a balance of making money and protecting the environment.
2315 2018-04-17 19:21:33 It’s very easy to make!!! Spam + garlic + mushrooms + rice + soy sauce + white pepper + red pepper flakes + a dash of sesame oil at the end! In that order!

2323 2018-04-17 19:20:26 Whatever oil pipeline you want to mention, do you think America will see any of this oil? The U.S is a net exporter of oil. Oil pipelines, as must as we in the west don't care for them, produce wealth, they produce energy and jobs thus the makings of a functioning society
2324 2018-04-17 19:20:15 So you have what logical path?

1. USA burns middle east with endless war & allying with radicalized wahabists.
2. Middle east burns. People become desperate.
3. Radical leaders empowered by USA Arms Deals & Oil Trade recruit w/ religion.
5. Peaceful Muslims at fault 4 not fixing

2328 2018-04-17 19:19:12 Every job, every single one. Chemists and Engineers create virtually every product with oil as precursor formulation. (resin etc) There are zero replacements.Even Tesla cannot be produced without oil. In fact, modern polymer chemistry is what creates a Tesla. Science 101.

2331 2018-04-17 19:18:59 Was this the episode when Paul made a roulade using our pure peppermint oil? Does your delicious sounding biryani use fresh mint? We'd love the recipe!
2332 2018-04-17 19:18:55 why does my mind think it looks like coffee, 
but it's actually oil being poured onto those valves?
2333 2018-04-17 19:18:49 Any policy to increase Canada's oil dependency on foreign sources, during this global political climate, is not only idiotic, it is criminal.

2337 2018-04-17 19:18:13 there's a civil war brewing in Canada over some goddamn oil
2338 2018-04-17 19:18:13 Finna Drop $40 On has cuz the “president” wanna go to war with Syria knowing that’s where the oil come from smh
2339 2018-04-17 19:18:08 But what would they do with the refined oil?
2340 2018-04-17 19:18:02 That’s cuz by proxy his real boss is the oil and gas industry
2341 2018-04-17 19:18:01 Don’t be misinformed lol I seen a sex Ed teacher put a TINY clinic one over an Oil Sheen spray bottle
2342 2018-04-17 19:17:59 Question: Where are you most likely to find an old oil rag? Well, in my world, how about on the garage floor?
2343 2018-04-17 19:17:50 Top tip..
Put the gears into the highest one (smallest rear cog) - it's easier to remove/put back together..

The other one is use WD-40 or similar thin oil to clean the chain before soap and water..
Spray it with the oil then run it through a cloth.
2344 2018-04-17 19:17:35 You don’t listen to a single word, do you? As I said 1000 times,poor farmers,personal property/homes,all Boers are NOT the target,it’s the conglomerated monopolies, the massive landowners, the wealth of resource (mineral/oil) exploiters &those who made wealth from immoral means.
2345 2018-04-17 19:17:34 Lot of green votes on this board have been very supportive of oil and gas. This type of push back might be why some are just getting out altogether.

2347 2018-04-17 19:17:09 Well duh! But rail capacity will increase with more oil cars rather than grain & lumber cars which are already in short supply. Questions asked about increasing capacity for oil. Ralston didn’t answer the questions, as usual for this govt.
2348 2018-04-17 19:17:08 @AJWVictoriaBC are you a Canadian? You want a refinery in BC but not the oil? What about the coal that flows through the lower mainland?
2349 2018-04-17 19:17:01 Boehner must have some really good dirt on McConnell.  Looks like they will have to reclassify it now right. Can't have the farmers all growing a regulated drug! 
The new Oil fields are Mary Jane!
2350 2018-04-17 19:16:57 Patriotism? That one's new! In Norway the fossil question is mainly about economy and jobs. Which makes sense, of course, it's our biggest industry. Plus lots of desinformation from the fossil lobby that Norwegian oil actually is more climate friendly than non-Norwegian oil.
2351 2018-04-17 19:16:45 "Such things as you have"- Moses had only a rod,  but a rod with God can open a red sea. David had only five pebbles, but these with God brought down Goliath. The woman had only a little pot of oil with God paid all her debts. The poor widow was scraping the bottom of the barrel,

2357 2018-04-17 19:15:56 I just microwaved easy mac for a full 3 minutes before realizing I forgot to add water. I just microwaved dry pasta. And I’m 6,000 miles over for an oil change.

2366 2018-04-17 19:14:45 The Arabs do that with oil, so nothing really new under the sun... In fact I say YAASSSSS to that!
2367 2018-04-17 19:14:44 You still couldn’t abolish taxes. If for no other reason than to give value to the money the government is just printing out of thin air.  The dollar is the number one medium of exchange because the government makes you pay taxes, and you can’t pay them in oil or chickens.
2368 2018-04-17 19:14:44 You've been referencing oil a lot lately.

2388 2018-04-17 19:11:27 About time. Next we should stop transfer payments to Quebec when they buy oil elsewhere
2389 2018-04-17 19:11:22 We think this is due to various market control mechanisms. For example, sugar (production & imports) is under government monopoly. Palmoil, most common commercial brand of cooking oil in the country, is imported by the government and typically distributed at subsidized prices.

2408 2018-04-17 19:09:46 I ran out of hair oil and I just put bio oil in I may have just done something but I’m not sure whether it was a good or bad something
2409 2018-04-17 19:09:41 You forgot to mention how these terrorist groups and nations like Saudi Arabia are allies or funded or armed by the USA or past USA dealings.

You say God is the excuse? "Democracy" and "Economy" and "Oil" are the excuses we use to create and perpetuate this mess.
2410 2018-04-17 19:09:38 More precise: Chemicals from hydrocarbons are irreplaceable. Every product we use derived from oil. No exceptions. No plane, bus, bike, clothing, wood product, brick, sealant, packaging, food  could be managed without it. Oil indispensable to every job in world. Science 101.

2423 2018-04-17 19:08:06 Because they've done an oil deal with the USA decades ago.
2424 2018-04-17 19:08:06 We are aware of an incident which has seen oil enter a stream in Riverside Park in #Huntingdon. With @huntsdc, our officers have been working to contain and clear the oil from the water. Please take care and follow the advice displayed on signs around the affected area.
2425 2018-04-17 19:08:06 Like an oil spill.
2426 2018-04-17 19:08:04 What's that you live in an oil rich country with an inferior military and no strong allies to support you?
2427 2018-04-17 19:08:04 To be fair to Scott Pruitt, I don't actually know how often time travelers from the future try to kill him because an oil lobbyist in charge of the EPA is literally the worst thing possible and if you want to prevent a global apocalypse, he's your best bet
2428 2018-04-17 19:07:46 They’re bluffing. Oil is still down, so is production. They can’t afford to stop selling their oil in BC.
2429 2018-04-17 19:07:31 I’m finally getting my oil changed like an adult after going 2000 miles over when I was supposed to get it changed I’m. The worst

2432 2018-04-17 19:07:26 Unlike giving it to Texas oil barons that money would go right back into the economy. Unlike throwing it at corporations the money would not go into offshore accounts.
2433 2018-04-17 19:07:19 This @AEI event is bizarrely framed around weak side issue aggressively promoted by the oil companies: municipal bonds. Why?

2436 2018-04-17 19:06:41 Dead horse?

Oil demand growing worldwide to at least 2040. Then flat for a few decades as very tough to replace in energy mix.

Let’s call it a golden goose if you must use animal labels.

Coal, oil and gas provide about 2/3 of the world total energy use. 1000 barrels a second.

The Independe newspaper had a piece of how the U.S. is assembling Arab nations 2 contribute w/ soldiers as he wants 2 bring home the U.S. soldiers in Syria
2440 2018-04-17 19:06:22 Importing foreign oil by way of tankers is a great idea, but wait is that not the reason BC does not want the pipeline .... more tankers? So you are basically saying BC is not anti oil it’s anti Alberta and Saskatchewan??

2442 2018-04-17 19:06:13 I think Gabe got into the coconut oil again.  
2443 2018-04-17 19:06:10 I hate to break it to you, darling, but you ain’t no oil painting and your views are just as unattractive.

2446 2018-04-17 19:05:39 Bring the oil
2447 2018-04-17 19:05:35 Went to get an oil change & had to buy 2 new tires as well. How's your day?
2448 2018-04-17 19:05:19 What do you think about oil companies here, Jim?  Thank you
2449 2018-04-17 19:05:14 Stop repeating this Commie shit. KM is publicly owned, so you can buy a share and be an owner too! Plus, my family enjoys eating so all the growth in the oil industry benefits hundreds of thousands of workers like me. Leftists don't care about people though...
2450 2018-04-17 19:05:07 @AlbertaatNoon Yedlin's personal comments on KM diminish the important role that journalists have in remaining objective, analytical and neutral when outlining issues to the public. Her place is more as a spokesperson for the oil patch and not as a credible journalist.
2451 2018-04-17 19:05:02 That's why he will flip like an egg on hot oil. He is family man unlike Trump he is a devoted father and he won't do 10 years for the thug that forgot him when he went to D.C.
2452 2018-04-17 19:04:55 Out of curiosity, does Starbucks have any stores in the ‘hood?

Sincerely doubt it.  You know, “demographics” and all that.  Seems like Starbucks’ execs need the minority training.

2454 2018-04-17 19:04:19 Does someone knows about  electrolysis of crude oil?
2455 2018-04-17 19:04:03 Oil Sands are very competitive...there simply isn't enough infrastructure to transport the product out of site.  If everyone would stop blocking pipelines, then you'd see a massive increase in production immediately.  Only activist governments and eco-terrorists inhibit it.
2456 2018-04-17 19:04:03 A woman that worked for the ford dealership at the car show this past weekend told us she never changed her oil in her car for 8 years
2457 2018-04-17 19:03:53 Not sure if it just me, but since Disney obtained the rights of SW. The prices of these sets went way up. But it can also be because of the oil prices.
2458 2018-04-17 19:03:42 I know. I was in Libya under Khadafi. It wasn’t free but it was safe and the living standards were decent and life expectations were long. Filipinos ran the oil fields, rug merchants were astonishingly honest and not pushy, and the only hotel was clean though far from plush.
2459 2018-04-17 19:03:40 They are going to crucify that snake oil selling, hyperbolic charlatan.
2460 2018-04-17 19:03:29 I have used the recipe that Cynthia transcribed.  It is pretty close to dads.  I just use less olive oil.  #bestcroutons
2461 2018-04-17 19:03:25 Mark Martin just busted the oil cooler open on the gap in the pit road wall at Michigan.
2462 2018-04-17 19:03:24 We can do it. Justice and fairness in Canada for the unlucky impoverished Canadians. Start with raising the price of the people's oil going to American oil companies from $7 a barrel to $60 a barrel (the world price). These are CANADIAN resources being stolen.

2468 2018-04-17 19:02:54 I think many Canadians are concerned that the oil industry lobby over inflates it's importance to our economy. Don't forget we are heavily subsidizing foreign owned corporations shipping tar to China, employing a few thousand, not 100s of 1000s, and we get to pay for the clean up
2469 2018-04-17 19:02:42 OIL DIFF: 5.24 -> 5.19

2nd) shut off B.C.s NG flowing through Alberta

3rd) stop all goods moving through Alberta by rail and trucks

If Canada wants to bring Alberta to a halt ... we'll bring all of Canada to a halt

2502 2018-04-17 18:59:04 It’s not about the oil per say, it’s about maintaining the USD peg to oil via Saudi Arabia and OPEC. US had plenty of oil here... but in theory you’re right.

Madam influencer
2504 2018-04-17 18:58:34 How nice of her to admit that men have good qualities. But the venom with which she talks about men and right wing views (which are not evil btw) negates the positive.
2505 2018-04-17 18:58:28 Nonsense! There is no money in oil or pushing the agenda of oil producers! The REAL money is in climate science and scaring people with tall tales of "climate change"!

(I honestly find it funny every time climate scientists are accused of talking climate change for the money.)
2506 2018-04-17 18:58:21 So you take my comment as arrogant why it’s a basic fact to have a green society you still need oil and gas turbines made from fibreglass metal copper all need oil and gas to be processed it’s easy to say go green but you still need oil and gas simple fact
2507 2018-04-17 18:58:01 Red chillis - a hand full, 1 garlic clove, 1 whole onion, half a table spoon Tumeric. measure ur own salt, black pepper, thyme. & a lot of olive oil, 1 whole lemon, a pitch of vinegar( not too much) and put it in a smoothie maker. keep in fridge. Honestly tates the same x
2508 2018-04-17 18:57:56 @AlbertaatNoon Northern US coal states are trans-shipping to China via the BC TwassenSuperPort. China is the largest greenhouse gas emitter because of coal: better our oil or natural gas till they and us can do solar/wind/nuclear. Mind you ‘hard’coal better than brown coal.
2509 2018-04-17 18:57:55 Lady - you are fucking clueless and lying. KM not an oil company - a pipeline company. More than 40 Indigenous bands along the route are signed on as partners. How do you think all these things you want get paid for - by industry and employed people and companies that pay tax.
2510 2018-04-17 18:57:54 I wish sanctions had worked and Hussein was ousted from within.  Of course we shouldn't be meddling, but that choice was made above Maddy's pay grade. Israel and oil are sacred cows of US foreign policy and come hell or high water they will guarantee their protection and control.

2512 2018-04-17 18:57:49 Yes!

2522 2018-04-17 18:57:20 Use the oil after the hot towel, or right after the shower. It help stop irritation for me.
2523 2018-04-17 18:57:16 assad didnt use chemical weapons. why would he especially when trump said he was moving troops out? then the so called attack happens? US was never leaving. its all lies for them to remain and bring in more troops for the oil.

2547 2018-04-17 18:55:07 Our hair sounds similar. Every ounce of oil I put in it is gone almost instantly. That's why I invested in a huge tub of coconut oil.

2552 2018-04-17 18:54:54 Liars they own the patient for CBD Oil since I believe 2007-8. They've known for over 100 years

2554 2018-04-17 18:54:28 What did you call logic?  Was there anywhere in that twit that I said APC inherited buoyant economy? Do you call $29 per barrel of oil or over 30 states owing salaries of  months a robust economy? Thank God for the bail out interventions. You read your mind,  not my tweets.
2555 2018-04-17 18:54:25 I second that. Let’s hear the story. Perhaps you could mention it during the 45 minutes of supportch as you’ve just about covered the topic of krill oil

2561 2018-04-17 18:53:44 Enviornmentalists need to realise the pipelines are the safest means of transport of oil/gas. I lived my whole life with pipelines our farm; one runs up my street now. The deer, rabbit, frogs, fox, eagles and coyotes that run through our town don't mind it.
2562 2018-04-17 18:53:39 All states on west coast HV refinery. Maharashtra has only 2 and that too in Mumbai. So konkan coast is available option. This cannot be moved inland else cost of oil refining will go up. Hope you understand the logistics part
2563 2018-04-17 18:53:35 But don't tell people about how their state taxes will go up. And #MobsterTrump blowing up oil prices so very possible $1 extra at the pumps.

2571 2018-04-17 18:52:42 Don't trouble. I know the argument that one day it will take more oil to produce oilnthan can be pumped irrespective of cost. I think we should be careful but not very worried. Must go.
2572 2018-04-17 18:52:15 The Ag Center at SU has been growing it for minute now. The only weak part about it is Louisiana isn't FULLY medicinal (yet) so it's just oil and other byproducts for now.
2573 2018-04-17 18:51:55 And yet they send @CountDankulaTV to court for a joke. Politics today has become something of a circus full of snake oil salesman. I'm feeling pretty disenfranchised at the moment and it looks like I will remain so until we get a None Of The Above option on ballot papers.
2574 2018-04-17 18:51:51 Well u need to understand the logistics of refinery. We import oil from Gulf by sea so most appropriate location is west coast as water transportation is cheap. Draught area inland ? Get ur facts updated
2575 2018-04-17 18:51:36 Yeah, I’m pretty sure the government cutting off the market supply of oil to an entire population is, at the least, the exact opposite of conservative.

2577 2018-04-17 18:51:25 Is there a country that has successfully implemented something similar? Other than oil rich nations like Dubai
2578 2018-04-17 18:51:10 Did you know that you need oil and gas to build solar panels and turbines or do they just mysteriously appear
2579 2018-04-17 18:51:04 imagine the grease.....all that oil it would secrete.............

2581 2018-04-17 18:50:45 Ditto and agreed. If you don't get your med soon, and you do have access to CBD oil, I recommend it as an aid, if not an outright replacement.

2584 2018-04-17 18:50:37 She didn't say "thank God those family-supporting positive role models were there"

She said "construction workers"

As in, "guys that can probably kick the shit out of the guy I'm afraid of"

It was that simple

2587 2018-04-17 18:50:30 I've come to the sad realization that #TarteCosmetics puts coconut oil in a lot of the skincare products. This means I cannot use them because coconut oil makes me break out. Excuse me while I go cry in a corner 
2588 2018-04-17 18:50:28 BC does not want Alberta oil so the Airport should be getting ready to import from other sources.
2589 2018-04-17 18:50:22 I want to start using "Big Data" the same way folks say "Big Oil", to talk about Google/Facebook/etc.

2593 2018-04-17 18:50:07 They’re BLUFFING! Alberta cannot afford to stop selling oil, their exports have already dropped and they can’t afford losing BC customers. Empty bluff.
2594 2018-04-17 18:50:07 He probably still can't believe they all got away and nobody paid any price at all.
2595 2018-04-17 18:50:05 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
2596 2018-04-17 18:50:01 It would appear that the NDP Government doesn’t want an expansion of the KM pipeline but they sure as hell want the oil in the existing one.
2597 2018-04-17 18:50:00 Have you tried CBD oil for her?
2598 2018-04-17 18:49:44 Stupid oil
2599 2018-04-17 18:49:41 I agree with the first half. I disagree on the second. Oklahoma for instance is bought and sold by the oil companies who are getting away with environmental catastrophes (i.e. wastewater disposal wells).
2600 2018-04-17 18:49:30 Since @POTUS Trump has been in office gas prices continues 2 rise. Talk ish 2 the gas companies to lower the price of crude oil. Gas will be 4 a gallon b4 summer at this rate.

2603 2018-04-17 18:48:39 Lol so basically ,women are the only ones who are supposed to be punished physically... Viva Cooking oil...
2604 2018-04-17 18:48:31 I haven’t been this sick EVER in my adult life. The silver lining of this is that both of my parents came to check on me and bring me Gatorade. And mom did Mom things like peel me an apple and give me oregano oil. Normally we are 2000 miles apart.
2605 2018-04-17 18:48:31 There is a plan in place.  Energy companies cannot even begin operations without a gov’t approved remediation plan.  The oil companies who operate them will pay.  This is a fact. @Lenoregalickkay @OilsandNews @OilsandNews @oilrespect
2606 2018-04-17 18:48:24 The gateman in my house cooks up a storm every now and then. Clouds of smoke from frying oil and the oil itself raining down on every unsuspecting passerby.
2607 2018-04-17 18:48:21 Completely disagree. Economy of Mexico is MUCH stronger today than in 1990. Then when price of oil dropped, the country tanked. Now, when price of oil went down, economy keeps right on going. Mexico has middle class now. There is actual hope that extreme poverty can be eliminated
2608 2018-04-17 18:48:07 Integrity and Hannity are like oil and water

2612 2018-04-17 18:47:17 They don't recognise it when it's staring them in the face. Almost every problem in the black community stems from a chronic absence of authentic masculinity.

2614 2018-04-17 18:46:56 I've made up my mind to switch career path from #HSE in the Oil and Gas sector to #IT with a 12 months training from #Google but I'm scared.
2615 2018-04-17 18:46:53 Help I’m barely two hours into an eight hour shift and I just realized I left my oil sheets at home what a disaster 
2616 2018-04-17 18:46:52 having oil changed and looking for someone to put on tint. sino meron kilala dito tx?
2617 2018-04-17 18:46:46 Not only BC, but every other customer for AB or SK oil and gas products needs to find new suppliers who won't use oil and gas as weapons, as Russia did to the EU.
2618 2018-04-17 18:46:45 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.
2619 2018-04-17 18:46:23 Our men & women in uniform have been degraded into nothing more than mercenaries for Big Oil. We stole Iraq's oil & currently have "control" over Syria's. Oil conglomerates make billions from this pilfered oil & thank the politicians who made it possible with hefty donations.
2620 2018-04-17 18:46:22 I can’t wait for summer day parties, beach days, skin lathered in coconut oil, popping wash n gos, deep tans, sundresses & sandals
2621 2018-04-17 18:46:16 Because he's a slimy snake who always takes what he wants and is such a bully no one challenges him. He couldn't care less what people think of him. The things he did while in office here were entirely for the benefit of his own career and the oil industry.
2622 2018-04-17 18:46:07 Also, my fellow Saskatchewan oil field workers will not appreciate their premier cutting sales and causing more lay offs.
2623 2018-04-17 18:46:06 Get a oil change they ass find 1000$ more problems  but he said I’m good
2624 2018-04-17 18:46:05 Finally got my oil changed. I feel accomplished.
2625 2018-04-17 18:46:04 thank you! I used prismacolour premier oil based pencils
2626 2018-04-17 18:45:57 Ah, that one where Corbyn’s aim to share the wealth we all produce is the same as Norway’s and he has similar policies but won’t work here because they have massive oil reserves but will turn us into Venezuela who also have massive oil reserves. Got it.
2627 2018-04-17 18:45:53 That is who his base is, they aren't switching or admitting anything, they drink snake oil for breakfast
2628 2018-04-17 18:45:50 The oil in peanut butter should do it. Let it sit til it penetrates then use a butter knife to remove it from the clothes you will just have to wash it again
2629 2018-04-17 18:45:48 But,  it's OK for our loving friends and family in BC to dump all over our economy and oil production.

2631 2018-04-17 18:45:47 RT TheLeap_Org: #JustinTrudeau needs to invest in renewables, transit and restoring a generation of cuts to nurses, teachers and daycare workers. Not bail out a Texas oil company with billions of public dollars.

Listen to NaomiAKlein's full and urgent #StopKM message at …
2632 2018-04-17 18:45:37 It’s ok to import oil delivered by tankers but not to export oil by way of tankers. Go  figure
2633 2018-04-17 18:45:19 Sick of BC, cut them OFF and let their ports fill up with freighters full of oil to keep them supplied.  The left already killed off Energy East, we keep making foreign countries rich using blood oil.  I am sick of Canadians being punished for f*ck all to appease the nutters!
2634 2018-04-17 18:45:17 Can you test your plan to get the provinces onside with an easy task. Get the BC NDP to cancel Site C. 

If you can't you may have to admit getting Alberta to give up oil might be hard too.

Also I apologize for the other post in this thread. Language like that is never needed.
2635 2018-04-17 18:45:15 David Suzuki is to receive an honorary degree from U of A? and yet he has openly opposed all fusil fuel expansions, including Kinder Morgan.

2642 2018-04-17 18:44:11 oil
2643 2018-04-17 18:44:08 Worth mentioning that existing pipelines could connect BC production(much of which is exported to AB now) with lower mainland refineries. Swing the valves and use BC produced oil as refinery in PG does?
2644 2018-04-17 18:44:07 I work at a store near oil fields in CO, so we’ll often have guys coming in after they’ve worked overnight that get decaf which I can understand, but anyone else???? What are you doing. Death before decaf!!!!
2645 2018-04-17 18:43:55 Saw #HenryV #OSF #Ashland This historic war/peace - alliance/dynasty strengthened France/England as premier world-colonizers, after WWII drawing borders defining oil reserves as 'countries', dividing Middle East towards the Perpetual Wars now lead by USA... 
Think #Syria today.
2646 2018-04-17 18:43:53 It's a shame our local Co-op store closed down to be replaced by a Poundstretcher . I will check next time I am in a Co-op to see how it compares to the other supermarkets. If @IcelandFoods can make a resolute stand on palm oil and plastic waste then let's see how you compare!
2647 2018-04-17 18:43:52 ): use some teatree oil and aloe

2656 2018-04-17 18:43:13 sounds really good.. i usually get a olive oil or balsamic vinegar mayo here i love the extra flavor
2657 2018-04-17 18:43:04 Take the oil to market is one thing. The other, is why the heck aren’t we using Canadian oil only, in Canada? It’s has crazy as importing maple syrup
2658 2018-04-17 18:43:01 @PhillyD I hope your enjoying your vacation! When you back i know a lot of your Canadian viewers would appreciate a story on the major pipeline war. It's BC vs AB, SK, and the Canadian Gov. AB and SK trying to approve laws to limit our oil and gas. Previously banned bc wine sales
2659 2018-04-17 18:42:50 Treasury are as bad - assessments of the cost of stopping off-shore oil and gas exploration take a business as usual approach, do not even identify climate change as an externality, not accounted for.
2660 2018-04-17 18:42:50 California refinery sector is setting records for crude oil imports from foreign sources and also increasingly selling refined fuels to Central America, Mexico, and many other markets around the Pacific Rim. Just addressing fuel demand in California is not a complete solution.

2686 2018-04-17 18:39:51 You’ve got an oil crisis between two provinces, Canadian communities without fresh water, a community that has a decaying port, no roads or rail and needs food drives for necessities and more Canadian issues.YET you give away millions and want to be International Man of the year!

2690 2018-04-17 18:39:26 I always make sauces up as I go. Probably a bit of yeast extract with oil and water, a spoon of tahini, then a dash of soya sauce or lemon juice. If it needs thickening then a bit of flour or oatmeal or porridge oats. :-)

2706 2018-04-17 18:38:27 here, hold this opened 10 Gallon of oil that is Seemingly empty and pay no mind to the oil covering you and the Floor around you.
2707 2018-04-17 18:38:25 So - where did you publish the data from this “remarkable” set of observations? What dose of Vitamin E oil did you use? How many other people did you repeat this on (to eliminate observer bias?.

2709 2018-04-17 18:38:13 This is not about oil, this is about getting more like minded people around the world. This is the only long-term garantor of American security. @realDonaldTrump

2714 2018-04-17 18:38:01 Well, I’m off to work! I’m in a good mood, can’t wait to see how it all goes wrong today. :P Will the fryer oil spill again, was none of the items replaced? I can’t find myself to care until I check in.
2715 2018-04-17 18:37:49 @trish_regan stop pushing your “it’s about oil” narrative and putting words into your guests mouth. He clearly stated that our interests in Syria are bringing our military home, blunting terror and Russia’s power, and protecting Israel. ALL #MAGA! @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness
2716 2018-04-17 18:37:49 Sebab aku rasa kau boleh gain banyak pengalaman.  You're not really into hse. Course kita ni banyak main process, qc, r&d kau boleh praktik balik apa yg kau dah belajar time U.  Jap position apa kau kat palm oil?  Kalau general lagi best 
2717 2018-04-17 18:37:43 I wash and sometimes condition every other week. I also put oil in my hair which eats it up
2718 2018-04-17 18:37:40 can you guys do a podcast about how crude oil gets refined into gasoline. Genuinely curious.
2719 2018-04-17 18:37:34 Use Groupon next time, you’ll basically pay the same price for a regular oil change but you’ll get synthetic

2721 2018-04-17 18:37:28 @trish_regan, hey Trish, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Israel etc........can you say oil, no no no, please stop and think ,,,, now say RELIGION!!!!!
2722 2018-04-17 18:37:27 No this is why "you" don't want the pipeline. Canada wants it and BC will be brought to bear on this. Turn your oil tap off if you don't like it. Make a difference. That includes petroleum products you purchase, fuel in your car, what your home is built with etc. Hypocricy
2723 2018-04-17 18:37:23 you're not gonna be

2743 2018-04-17 18:35:22 nearly as easily as regular crude. the Exxon Valdez didn't get cleaned up very well, and Exxon dragged their feet when paying Alaskans for the damage. No one knows if or how heavy oil can be cleaned up in the open ocean & an incredibly rich marine environment. it probably can't.

2750 2018-04-17 18:35:02 This is exactly what @elonmusk is talking about when he says he's willing to go head to head with big oil no subsidies.  The subsidies renewable energy gets are dwarfed by the subsidies big oil gets and the unpriced externality of its pollution.

2800 2018-04-17 18:29:21 Dumping shit into waters is regrettable; but that doesn't justify another pipeline that will jump tanker traffic in ever narrow Burrard inlet, let alone 14 oil storage tanks on top of 12 on Burnaby Mountain

2814 2018-04-17 18:27:57 She obviously hates these men except when she is in danger. His point is solid.
2815 2018-04-17 18:27:35 "hardly ever" is the problem. It has to be never, not hardly ever. BC can't afford to have 1 serious accident, but with greatly increased bitumen tanker traffic it becomes a lot more likely. Bitumen/heavy oil can't be reclaimed or cleaned up 1/

2842 2018-04-17 18:24:53 I am totally for the oil. It serves so many. I am not for legalizing street marijuana. Codeine cough medicines were the best until it was abused and needed a script to get. But street drugs are not the same as medicinal use.
2843 2018-04-17 18:24:44 It does not work that way the west has zero regard for syrian people infact the offered to make assad the next saddam and bring him in the circle if he let them drill in the golan heights and cut off the Russians gas ,but he refused. Its oil and gas and pnac
2844 2018-04-17 18:24:43 Whatever dude. You won’t protest Saudi or Stan countries oil that have no environmental/human rights laws whatsoever and charge end users Brent pricing, but stand firm on your soap box against the hand that feeds you. You embody everything currently wrong with this country.
2845 2018-04-17 18:24:23 When looking at flow mediated dilation, olive oil was found to impair & damage endothelial function the same way as other oils do. So olive oil is better than others & extra virgin is better than regular. But none have a significant protective effect. Use it, just use it wisely.
2846 2018-04-17 18:24:18 Just go to Walmart and get that Pit crew oil change g
2847 2018-04-17 18:24:16 But the oil is going to get over there in some way. Pipeline is the safest!
2848 2018-04-17 18:24:04 Crema idratante e stop. Quando ho voglia ogni tanto la sostituisco con il Bio Oil. Non è che servono mille cose
2849 2018-04-17 18:23:57 Make sure you talk about how the CCS coal plant Petra Nova is going
And are they getting the oil pumped out like planned
Curious you know because they own half
2850 2018-04-17 18:23:52 I almost quit this morning. I think I'm about to eliminate everything except stocks, gold, oil, and Houston Astros baseball.
2851 2018-04-17 18:23:39 People are paying so much money for the new Fenty body oil when you can just put some finely milled glitter and oil in a bottle, shake it up, and literally get the same effect #staywoke
2852 2018-04-17 18:23:30 This may be shocking, but Russia has its own oil and plenty of it. The reason Russia is involved is because they have been a Syrian ally for the last 60 years. They also have a warm water port in Syria. Which Russia needs. The US is in it to weaken Russia.
2853 2018-04-17 18:23:26 I struggle to understand the question because listing is a strategic decision. E.g. If National Oil feel like listing is in their strategic interests, then they should list.
2854 2018-04-17 18:23:23 Wrong.
1) u ignore first Q 
2) We export over 3 MM bbls / day of oil. Our investment climate is beyond prohibitive - NW upgrader in Edmonton 75 MBD feed, cost $9 B. So 3 MM BPD refining capacity cost $350 B. And all the pipes to move that product.
Not even close.
2855 2018-04-17 18:23:19 Anybody know how to get an oil stain out
2856 2018-04-17 18:23:10 So Does @DominosIN put oil based Mayonnaise in its products as a replacement to cheese??
This is reported by @BBCWorld!!
2857 2018-04-17 18:23:06 Took my car in for a $40 oil change and end up with a broken ignition switch estimated at $700 
2858 2018-04-17 18:22:07 I've heard fish harvesters say that if you go back to the ten years after WW2 there was nothing in the ocean.  There was a lot of activity going on underwater then too. I don't want to believe govt would sell out our fishery like that for oil.
2859 2018-04-17 18:22:00 The cost of an oil change for a Bugatti Veyron is $20,000. #randomfactoftheday

2863 2018-04-17 18:20:58 Fuck @pepboysauto for taking all damn day to do a basic ass oil change. Dropped my car off this morning and niggas still ain’t even started on my shit.
2864 2018-04-17 18:20:56 I have found on days when my wife is cranky, to hide myself in a closet until the stench of sulphur is replaced with the aroma of lavender oil. #survival
2865 2018-04-17 18:20:31 Well, everyone who perpetuates the destruction of our oceans through pollution & land through oil extraction & landfills is, at least in part, to blame. No one's guiltless, I'm forced to use plastics myself but the only way for us to overcome climate change is to go zero-waste.
2866 2018-04-17 18:20:29 All I'm saying is if you don't like the way my pool floats smell (baby oil & semen) then don't use them.
2867 2018-04-17 18:20:28 Robots are picking fruit-even strawberries AND it is shameful for you to degrade "Illegals"  as servants for your fruit and cleaning. Tariffs have not been enacted so if you are being gouged then report it.Gas prices are due to oil market-Potus did nothing to it. Study up

2870 2018-04-17 18:20:11 It's all about the oil and gas links. Nothing is more important than that. The west can change a persons personality overnight. And do ...often.
2871 2018-04-17 18:20:10 I honestly had to hold back the laughter when I learned that Alberta plans on cutting off BC from gasoline shipments. Especially when BC's responded the way they did. Either you don't want any oil/gas heading into BC in which case accept the consequences of that or let it all in.
2872 2018-04-17 18:19:53 YES!  It was my principals on on palm oil that lead me to YES in the first place!
2873 2018-04-17 18:19:45 Obama bailed out GM, Obama's regulations on denying off shore drilling and access to other oil reserves helped create the gas prices that shot through the roof. And as far as the mortgage goes, that was liberal everyone should get a loan bullshit too.
2874 2018-04-17 18:19:42 Finding a good facial moisturizer has been theeee most difficult thing I've been trying to do so far this year smh. Right now I moisturize with aloe vera gel and vitamin E oil but I need something else. Like a cream maybe
2875 2018-04-17 18:19:36 hello i’m natalie and i had a fight with hot oil today and the oil won
2876 2018-04-17 18:19:17 I agree with NDP John Horgan. Who would want Alberta's dirty oil. I think NDP Rachel Notley should close the tap and give John his wish. Then BC can buy all their oil from the USA, at a greater cost. Hey, doesn't that oil come from Alberta ???
2877 2018-04-17 18:19:16 It all depends on what you’re trying to achieve.
Oil Quick can’t be ignored for the fact it’s a mature product and has a firm loyal following.
2878 2018-04-17 18:19:03 And what does this have to do with an oil pipeline from Alberta to British Columbia though?

Also, every data center constructs its own power source, so they're added at the same rate... Few rely on carbon. Those that do use natural gas, which is better burned than released.
2879 2018-04-17 18:19:03 Your thoughts on MCT/Coconut Oil as a supplement? Good/bad/no opinion?

2883 2018-04-17 18:18:56 AB should not cut off oil, they should simply use the full capcity of the existing line to ship heavy oil, no refined products.  This gets more dilbit to market with the existing infrastructure.  If that doesn’t get the desired result, then shut it down fully by tourist season.
2884 2018-04-17 18:18:46 Diet jelah. Helps a lot tbh. Cut down sugar, oil, more fruits and vegetables. Aku buat 1 month kulit better. Skarang je breakout balik sbb tak jaga diet
2885 2018-04-17 18:18:37 Sorry this is tragic, but this war is directly to blame on the west and the arab spring propaganda campaign in the name of genie oil and syrian pipeline rights ,take your pnac propaganda somewhere else and let syria push isil out

2898 2018-04-17 18:17:39 1/2 Ross, I think your point is worth discussing. I think that the no need for Alberta oil is a stretch based on IMO 2020. But to think that a portion of Kinder Morgans decision has nothing to do with the long term outlook on heavy crude would be wrong.

2918 2018-04-17 18:14:49 This is how these grifters signal power to each other: Pruitt knows he's saving the oil industry billions and billions of dollars by allowing them to poison our environment for free and wants them to understand that he doesn't come free and expects a multimillion payday from them

2922 2018-04-17 18:14:04 And, moving away from oil doesn't = moving away from a resource economy.

2935 2018-04-17 18:12:45 Isn’t unemployment at a low not seen since the 70s? Besides, the social program coffers are going to remain low until we can start selling oil to someone other than the USA.
2936 2018-04-17 18:12:27 You want this because of your consistent anti-west position that feeds into the conspiratorial idea that we only go to war for our own interests (oil). It will prevent us from acting swiftly when necessary. PM can be questioned after & if the action is wrong, they'll pay for it.
2937 2018-04-17 18:12:27 Horgan claims he can restrict oil coming into B.C., but when Alberta says they’ll restrict oil heading into B.C. he threatens to sue them. 

Does Horgan think he is control of Alberta’s oil?

How does he not see the insane hypocrisy here? What a fool.

2974 2018-04-17 18:08:48 mayo's good while cooking cause it's basically just oil+egg yolks
2975 2018-04-17 18:07:36 they better not come from under the hood of my car explaining other shit that needs to be done when i only came for an oil change..
2976 2018-04-17 18:07:22 Mustard, curry sauce, chili oil
2977 2018-04-17 18:07:20 Tea tree oil for spot treatment, witch hazel to disinfect and cleanse, and aloe Vera to soothe, reduce redness and swelling
2978 2018-04-17 18:07:11 Water is not wet, you can't have wet water you just get more water.

Now you can make water wet with oil, or wet some oil with water.. but water alone cannot be wet. Having the term wet implies a dry state, never seen a glass of dry water.
2979 2018-04-17 18:07:05 Y’all wanna know why the wangs are so good at the skrip club in atl? They fry the chicken with the same thing they rub the dancing queens zown with...baby oil

2984 2018-04-17 18:06:40 Oh, no, no, not just "toxic masculinity" but "toxic white masculinity." The left wouldn't touch supposed or alleged "toxic masculinity" in the African-American community with a ten foot pole.
2985 2018-04-17 18:06:38 If AB/SK want a trade war over oil, here's what @jjhorgan should do:
If the pipeline limits are imposed, triple the subsidies to BC resident car buyers for new/used EV or Hybrid vehicles! They want to fight against the future? We can fight for it! #bcpoli #abpoli #kindermorgan
2986 2018-04-17 18:06:27 TSA in Detroit sucks ..duty free wrapped and won't let Olive oil through
2987 2018-04-17 18:06:25 Anyone know of any good mechanics in western Lake county who would be willing to teach someone to change oil? My son wants to learn how to change oil in his car and I don’t know how. Need contact and pricing please.
2988 2018-04-17 18:06:23 Satan wants to drain the oil of our lamps and replace it with passions of this world.  We are told how to defeat this:

2993 2018-04-17 18:05:39 What will BC do for oil while their lawsuit works its way through the courts?

2995 2018-04-17 18:05:26 You don’t like Alberta oil so don’t complain when it’s taken away, hypocrites!
2996 2018-04-17 18:05:26 Too true. I only want to try it’s oil not it’s "recreational" use
2997 2018-04-17 18:05:11 African black soap + witch hazel + lemon oil and rose water =  my skin is about 85% clear cause of this routine!
2998 2018-04-17 18:05:07 With the oil and gas dispute happening with our provinces ,I was wandering where they truck the crude that comes out of B.C (Fort St.John area). Does it go to Alberta?

You can block me

But you can't have Bush uninvade Iraq for oil.
3005 2018-04-17 18:04:44 Agree. With oil, gas and coal any "business as usual" economic analysis is just not tenable. Climate change means we cannot afford business as usual. Yet that is the approach taken by Treasury economists.
3006 2018-04-17 18:04:37 shoutout to Jamaican black castor oil for making me a better person
3007 2018-04-17 18:04:35 . @RachelNotley is the Nightrider. she's a fuel injected suicide machine. she is a rocker, she is a roller, she is an out-of-controller! and to top it off she's an oil shill for a texas oil giant
3008 2018-04-17 18:04:33 And this is what's wrong with modern football now  a "new club" that was founded in the 70's but as soon as the oil money rolls in it's a "new club"... wow
3009 2018-04-17 18:04:24 Thanks be to God the temperatures are rising. Had 3 deliveries of oil during this v cold winter, Putting the thermals in the blanket box. Bring on the Summer @MetEireann

3011 2018-04-17 18:03:59 Been trying my best to stay strong  to keep my mind on other things,but I get stuck zoning out thinking about my grandmother.Her death put a major affect on me and got me heart broken.All i keep thinking about is how I would help bathe her &amp; oil her long dreads
3012 2018-04-17 18:03:57 The massmurdering cowboys also take oil, gas and gold after bombing a country to smithereens. 
3013 2018-04-17 18:03:49 i’m supposed to be getting ready and getting an oil change before my haircut but i’m so cold i can’t get outta bed
3014 2018-04-17 18:03:49 Googled how to make my hair grow fast and said put egg, olive oil, coconut and other stuff on. I DO NOT recommend anyone try’s makes your hair greasy no matter how many times you wash it out  head up to anyone that trying it X
3015 2018-04-17 18:03:37 I hate any oil, since I have a thin hair. I look like a sick person when I apply oil. This one is good! Yeah you can present it if u really want to.. just to smell it when you kiss her on forehead!  oh that's romantic !
3016 2018-04-17 18:03:05 I had this problem You gotta start drinking hella water your skin is dehydrated the extra oil acts as a moisturizer
3017 2018-04-17 18:02:54 OIL DIFF: 5.27 -> 5.24
3018 2018-04-17 18:02:53 do grain cars ship grain or oil
3019 2018-04-17 18:02:52 I'm not familiar with the plant oil industry. Is "servings of salad dressing" a technical term?
3020 2018-04-17 18:02:50 This is how these grifters signal power to each other: Pruitt knows he's saving the oil industry billions and billions of dollars by allowing them to poison our environment for free and wants them to understand that he doesn't come free and expects a multimillion payday from them
3021 2018-04-17 18:02:46 2 things that suck today & nobody seems to care:
Let's start with cheese. I used to make cheese crackers, but the processed cheese of today has so much oil and crap ingredients they don't come out well.
2nd, chocolate, it's easy to fake chocolate. Brown is an easy color to make.
3022 2018-04-17 18:02:46 I pay less taxes, ISIS is mostly destroyed, North Korea will give up its nukes, gangs and sex traffickers are being arrested faster than ever, Net oil exporter, more Full time jobs coming back, etc etc etc.  I love Trump’s results

3025 2018-04-17 18:02:13 I’m at the dealership getting an oil change drinking a smoothie and they got the news on talking about fiesta food and I am getting HUNGRY
3026 2018-04-17 18:02:10 Hi Michelle, I didn't create this petition but did sign it and encourage other Canadians to read up on this issue and consider sending this message too.  I don't believe our government should be spending billions of tax dollars to subsidize for-profit oil infrastructure.
3027 2018-04-17 18:02:09 I've lived in Alberta my Whole life. It's a real Paradox of Priorities living here. Many of the Alberta Oil Industry Grass Roots Boosters are Willfully Ignorant Homophobic, Misogynistic, Banal Materialists. The Dogma of The Tea Party came form here as well.
3028 2018-04-17 18:02:07 I moisturize both at night and in the morning! I have dry skin so it tries to overcompensate by creating more oil which can cause break outs. So I felt the same when it came to moisturizing. I just use vitamin e oil now! Which hasn't given me any problems lately!
3029 2018-04-17 18:01:59 Civet oil won’t smell as concentrated as civet paste but yeah smells like old lady

3034 2018-04-17 18:01:29 He’ll end up getting a job as an oil lobbyist. They also have no shame and low morals.
3035 2018-04-17 18:01:24 Did this actually happen? I hate that I’m so cynical@now.
3036 2018-04-17 18:01:21 But but, I think this oil is the better one.. My mom, sis n all cousins still use this.. There's also a bit yellowish bottle right ?? I like d smell of dat...
3037 2018-04-17 18:01:16 Actually ya I forgot about the mega bucks behind the campaign from Tides, LeadNow, Rockefellers and all the foreign oil companies that she is making billions for.
3038 2018-04-17 18:01:16 Thankful that I’m with someone who can do minor tasks like car oil changes because as minor as something like that is, it can send me off a ledge.. I stress too much 
3039 2018-04-17 18:01:10 Oil companies hedge bets on low-carbon future...
3040 2018-04-17 18:01:05 I usually go coconut or olive. I use vegetable sometimes if I need the oil to be tasteless.

And screw you too.
3041 2018-04-17 18:01:00 Or a leaking oil well drilling in pristine lands that were protected...well pristine before you got that as your bargain to sign a tax bill for the upper 1%.
3042 2018-04-17 18:00:58 Peppermint oil is a lifesaver 
3043 2018-04-17 18:00:56 How on earth is doubling down on oil extraction “Working to make life better”? If anything, it is exactly the opposite. @RachelNotley
3044 2018-04-17 18:00:48 So Treasury economists ignore the climate change cost of exploring for, finding and using more oil and gas. Is this the usual standard of their work - very incomplete analysis that ignores the physical and ecological realities and limits of this planet?

3049 2018-04-17 18:00:11 Of course it can, but it must be refined first, just like crude oil.
3050 2018-04-17 18:00:11 Did you know that some castor oils have been washed with hexane? Not St. Francis Castor Oil. It's organic & comes in a dark glass bottle.
3051 2018-04-17 18:00:08 Always have vegetables on hand. Saute a big bag of frozen mixed vegetables in olive oil and garlic. Add some red pepper or turmeric for additional flavor and separate into portion-sized containers for the fridge. #TIP

3055 2018-04-17 17:59:44 Reason number 1000000 that women are better: @jacindaardern, NZ PM just put a ban on new offshore oil exploration in a step to wheen her country off fossil fuels while @JustinTrudeau, the PM of Canada, to use 2B of taxpayer dollars for a company bail out to get a pipeline built.

3061 2018-04-17 17:59:20 i found a really expensive hair recipe online and i swear the ingredients are coconut and castor oil, vitamin E, aloe vera and i just don't even know why, so -thankfully- the mother part of me woke up and then i knew that i shouldn't buy it
3062 2018-04-17 17:59:18 There you go.  And it could be transported like fuel oil or even in pipes.

3071 2018-04-17 17:58:36 NO WAY! do not ever present a kumarika for a girl.. try a lil better one, silicone oil..  
Well that's expensive. Well for me.. 
3072 2018-04-17 17:58:29 Another example of using selective “facts” to prove oil is on its way out. The truth is that in spite of rapid growth in renewables and EVs, global oil consumption is still growing at 1.3 million barrels per day, and has been for the last 30 years.
3073 2018-04-17 17:58:20 This is demonstrably incorrect. The whole impetus for getting our oil to tidewater is to break us free from the US captive market.
3074 2018-04-17 17:58:17 It Ok what women really want is low paying unskilled jobs in the oil and gas sector, Jason already tell them that.

3076 2018-04-17 17:58:07 I remember when oil was discovered in Ghana. Some of the politicians were saying that once we begin to extract the oil most of our financial problems will be over, there would be jobs here and there and also fuel prices will be very low.

Now look at us
Still under IMF
3077 2018-04-17 17:58:06 Representatives with the oil and gas industry say they will work on modifications (taking other routes etc) with their vendors and others
3078 2018-04-17 17:57:54 Exactlyyyyy .... we’re finally getting over the oil means oily/greasy for hair and skincare this needs to be next tbh
3079 2018-04-17 17:57:50 Hi Steph - it looks like the oil/flavor started leaking out of the popcorn bag.  We're very sorry about this!  We'd like to get some packaging information and make this right with you.  Could you email us at wecare@conagra.com with reference #63737412?  We'll get this taken care
3080 2018-04-17 17:57:38 I need to find someone to put my clip ins in!!! Umm help... someone pleaseeeee pleaseeee I don’t want a lot of oil in my head
3081 2018-04-17 17:57:35 lol. Butter is one of those things I rarely use. Usually its a splash of oil for eggs. If I used all that crap I'd be dead already.
3082 2018-04-17 17:57:27 I loveeee coconut oil
3083 2018-04-17 17:57:27 Stinging and very, very sour. The blog is certainly more likely to make eyes water than the fish oil polish delicacy!!
3084 2018-04-17 17:57:10 Nobody in Alberta working in the oil industry has lost a job or "suffered" because of KM delays. If I'm wrong I would love to hear who exactly has.
3085 2018-04-17 17:57:10 This is stupid.  Let's go backwards so that people can get thrills.  By definition less technologically challenging.  Will look really silly when next gas price/oil shock hits.  Once again driving by staring at hood emblem.  What about sharing more media profits with teams?
3086 2018-04-17 17:57:08 Plastic industry is basically oil industry, which makes it clear why we have a plastic epidemic with our oil epidemic.
3087 2018-04-17 17:57:01 I got two parking tickets this week, i need to buy a new phone, dues, and now a oil change fml
3088 2018-04-17 17:56:58 This is how these fossils signal power to each other: Pruitt knows he's saving the oil industry billions and billions of dollars by allowing them to poison our environment for free and wants them to understand that he doesn't come free and expects a multimillion payday from them.
3089 2018-04-17 17:56:55 My concern is what happened to Energy East under this government. The demand to provide an analysis with total greenhouse gas emissions is ridiculous considering that is NOT demanded of foreign oil burned here right now. This was done to appease Quebec.
3090 2018-04-17 17:56:50 OMG! 
And Canadians are going to stand for this? 
Sadly, the apathy we see in Canadians says yup!
They’ll stand for this! Just like they stood for M103, destruction of Alberta’s energy sector, hydro fiasco in Ontario, oil freighters not allowed in BC waters, the NWT forestry.

3093 2018-04-17 17:56:40 The oil companies that use the pipeline are not about to lose money. Alberta is just puffing up their chest.
3094 2018-04-17 17:56:39 Oil wars irrelevant to shortage. The problem is housing policy since 1980.

3102 2018-04-17 17:55:46 Sometimes, my pre-sex game involves luxuriating in my bed and puffing on a joint with incense burning, candles lit, essential oils diffusing, and cannabis oil marinating on my bits. Sometimes it involves frantically cleaning up my cat's hairball before my boyfriend arrives.
3103 2018-04-17 17:55:42 No. Canada does not need to export or import oil. We need to refine the oil sands bitumen here, onsite & use the products domestically. No tankers needed.
3104 2018-04-17 17:55:41 Ok. For oil and gas too?

3107 2018-04-17 17:55:27 And this is how they make everyone depressed and dependent on chemical drugs. Begin taking full spectrum CBD oil for a couple of weeks and you will see you no longer need this poison.
3108 2018-04-17 17:55:25 @terrybeech Your party promised to end oil companies’ subsidies. Now Trudeau talks of blowing tax dollars on U.S. billionaires, on Dick Kinder’s and Wm. Morgan’s bitumen pipeline-tanker project. It's NOT in Canada's interest. Please talk sense into Trudeau & Carr.
3109 2018-04-17 17:55:13 And what if the pipeline doesn't get built? What will happen then?

Wanna know: We will continue shipping MORE oil across the ocean in tankers from corrupt countries like Saudi Arabia!

Canada is LITERALLY funding places with little to no human rights OR environmental policies!
3110 2018-04-17 17:55:06 Who pledged to bring them back ??? FORTY FIVE.... and snake Graham is your crew... back to the subject...job creation has been de minimis....@POTUS has conned you all...nothing is permanent including the thousand dollar raise =$84 per month for ONE YEAR.  U bought the snake oil.

3113 2018-04-17 17:55:03 Why stop at stop oil to BC .....how about coal,potash, grain all bulk products that come from AB and Sask ......the unions that load the ships are huge financial supporters of NDP
3114 2018-04-17 17:54:39 But we should better not focus only on oil, we need to diversify.
3115 2018-04-17 17:54:36 Soak hands in warm olive oil once a week for strong nails and youthful looking hands.
3116 2018-04-17 17:54:34 These mfs at the oil change shop could really suck my dick and choke. But the cute white boy knew wassup 
3117 2018-04-17 17:54:31 Maintenance is no joke people! Change your oil or this could happen to you!!!

3123 2018-04-17 17:53:44 Trudeau already screwed the Eastern half of Canada by killing Energy East  and then blaming TRP . Instead of using Canadian oil the Irving refinery imports oil for Saudi Arabia . Imagine Saudi Arabia importing oil from Canada.
3124 2018-04-17 17:53:41 When you used to living high off the oil companies it’s hard to go back to an “honest days work” payscale.
3125 2018-04-17 17:53:35 Yeah basically same as early bandit and gsxr  oil cooled engine. Just 3 pipes off the fuel tap to carbs.
3126 2018-04-17 17:53:34 They said oil and water don’t mix now we all down at the beach washing off the fish
3127 2018-04-17 17:53:25 "The primary use of Civet oil that strikes everyone’s mind is its attention-grabbing fragrance that can uplift the moods and elevate the energy levels of the one who is wearing it and of those who are around." uplift my ass lol

Wow. Just wow.

3134 2018-04-17 17:52:38 Meanwhile, we'll have to accept refugees...most of them happy to just get away, for, by no mean intent, it is the US getting all oil indie that threw off their X year plans.

3135 2018-04-17 17:52:37 Two slices of pizza are the equivalent to swallowing 3 spoons of warm oil. Do you feel like eating pizza now?
3136 2018-04-17 17:52:34 Plastic bottles can't be recycled indefinitely & eventually new ones must be made from oil drills & the old ones end up in the ocean, killing the fish that people & birds eat & perhaps, affecting those too.
3137 2018-04-17 17:52:22 I don't do scented candles, but if they ever made one that smelled of brown butter and Murphy's oil soap, I would be sorely tempted.
3138 2018-04-17 17:52:18 How about we stop subsidizing oil, nuclear energy and coal and use that money for all to get a free education. This investment will bring about greater access to opportunity.
3139 2018-04-17 17:52:18 I buy all organic from fathallah masalan, coconut and jojoba oil together r really good
3140 2018-04-17 17:52:15 Club1872 have fucked it with that statement. Totally misjudged the mood.
Can everyone concerned with Rangers with the exception of fans who fork out for this arsehaggis we are swallowing shut the fuck up for the next 24hrs unless you are announcing Mourinho and an Oil Sheikh.
3141 2018-04-17 17:52:14 .@SecretaryZinke rejects call to lower offshore drilling royalties. Says growth in oil/gas production shows it's not needed
3142 2018-04-17 17:52:11 He's gonna have to sell a lot of snake oil to pay for this one.
3143 2018-04-17 17:52:03 ..are demanding high amounts of energy. Did you use a method of transportation that relied on fuel today? Are you using a smartphone made from oil? How about the clothes you're wearing- there's even oil in that! OIL IS IN EVERYTHING!

3147 2018-04-17 17:51:34 This treatment oil makes my hair feel so nice and soft... I'm definitely investing in a bottle
3148 2018-04-17 17:51:34 Their focus is clouded by the Oil in the Niger Delta region when they can start gold mines in their domains.
3149 2018-04-17 17:51:17 Of course they are. They'd prefer no obstruction to the Alaskan oil tankers headed for their coast. We're such saps to fall for that "support".
3150 2018-04-17 17:51:17 ok what oil do u recommend i use
3151 2018-04-17 17:51:17 ไหนว่าอยากลองโดนทำโทษไงคะ?
3152 2018-04-17 17:51:12 and now you do to SK the very thing you would have BC not do to SK, which is restrict oil sales. How ironic.

3159 2018-04-17 17:50:13 It’s not because of his job which is to save the bay ffs. He must be up to his neck in oil & gas dirty deals. From the scope of his security spending I’m guessing he’s double crossed Exxon, Rosneft, and Gazprom and he’s worried about getting whacked.

3161 2018-04-17 17:50:05 i guess that contract where the syrian government agreed to give russia profits from their oil and gas in exchange for mercenary protection must be one of those good non-imperialist efforts to wage wars for money.
3162 2018-04-17 17:50:03 My most essential oil is butter.
3163 2018-04-17 17:49:53 Animal fat gives a deeper, more rich flavor - more than olive oil or other types of oil. The fatty acids and aroma compounds in olive oils or other types of oils are lost when heated. Animal fat oxidizes with heat and creates new flavor compounds which improve complexity/flavor.

3182 2018-04-17 17:47:26 Simple! Because of oil wars to be at top of the council list for very limited stock is impossible, unless you have serious health ergo!

3194 2018-04-17 17:46:31 We are a group of realists who work at a media company (if you must know) that understand that the demand for energy is at a dramatic increase and although we are making great strides in renewable energy, it is not enough to meet our demands, therefore we will still NEED oil.
3195 2018-04-17 17:46:27 Dear Team @ScorpionCBS, your latest episode was about a tribe in North Africa, yet the wordings, like on the olive oil bottle are Swahili...a language mostly used in the East of Africa.

The Honduras episode was about backchannelling to help remove Mel Zelaya and install a temporary (& brutal) junta--no "vote" ever went before Congress.
StandingRock was an atrocity by Big Oil, approved at the state level.

Jas 5:14 KJV
3212 2018-04-17 17:44:50 Oh no, you don't. The price of oil is falling and will fall off a cliff once renewables passes a certain point of saturation. Building a pipeline to sell off natural resources to a not-exactly-ally at low prices seems like a bad plan.
3213 2018-04-17 17:44:26 No, but since their politicians are paid by the oil and auto industries it does makes sense.

3217 2018-04-17 17:43:58 I'm currently reading 'The Looting Machine' by Tom Burgis.
"Africa accounts for 13% of the world’s population and just 2% of its cumulative gross domestic product, but it is the repository of 15% of the planet’s crude oil reserves, 40% of its gold and 80%..."
3218 2018-04-17 17:43:58 This was the same for the iraq war.  I marched. waste of time.  Until they change the Law little will be done, money, oil and position talk. keep trying though!!

3227 2018-04-17 17:42:43 Just google bulletproof coffee! Coffee + coconut oil + butter + heavy whipping cream + dash of sweetener = deliciousness!
3228 2018-04-17 17:42:43 My point is that tarsands oil isn't going to the electrical grid in Canada. It's an exported good. Measuring exported petroleum products by kwh is like measuring water in the amount of steam it can produce.
3229 2018-04-17 17:42:38 @POTUS I'm in NY State. All of my taxes went up. My mortgage went up. The price of food in the supermarkets is through the roof as is the cost of gas and heating oil A minimum fill of 125 gallons is $358 and I'm POOR. Someone must be screwing you over big time!

3237 2018-04-17 17:41:39 Instead of "It's not if a spill happens but when", an On Scene Commander would say: "If a spill happens, where is it, what type of oil spilled, how much, what's at risk & what are my response options?"
3238 2018-04-17 17:41:26 that’s like several oil changes due 
3239 2018-04-17 17:41:17 At prices cheaper than Alberta oil can be sold in USA where refineries already built can accommodate this type of crude.
3240 2018-04-17 17:41:13 Great see NL company expanding internationally. Kudos to DF Barnes St. John’s on acquiring major fabrication company in Scotland, Burntisland Fabrications, leader in UK oil and gas industry. DF Barnes also looking to purchase Bull Arm site. @df_barnes @Business_NFLD @nlbusiness
3241 2018-04-17 17:41:03 So if it's illegal & unconstitutional for Alberta to restrict oil exports can we agree its illegal for BC to restrict the import of oil products? @Dave_Eby #bcpoli
3242 2018-04-17 17:40:54 If you're wrong we are going to boil you and @mikesobel in oil. 
#stopwinter #enoughwinter #needspring
3243 2018-04-17 17:40:43 Also useful for normal starts.  Lots and lots of bearing damage happens during normal starts because it takes a couple of of seconds for oil to get up to pressure.  (Also why I always try to prime oil systems in engines when I build them.)
3244 2018-04-17 17:40:37 People think their "tweets" on here is questioning IPPs like clean energy hasn't been fighting against coal and oil lobbyists for decades
3245 2018-04-17 17:40:33 I actually saw it on You tube and I saw the exact opposite.  Jensen said to not let them down and do a fic on a oil rig and in another con said he wanted to do a rom com with MIsha and talked about how much he loved him  He has said several times

3255 2018-04-17 17:39:52 No you get the translucent one so it doesn't show on your face it would just absorb the oil and make you matte.

3261 2018-04-17 17:39:30 Wonshik: I like coconut smell
Me, who uses coconut oil as a moisturizer: oh really now
3262 2018-04-17 17:39:23 Oh sure, but I have to imagine a lot of that is not getting oil up to the bearings fast enough.  Pre-pressurize everything with an electric pump, and I think a lot of that damage would go away.  (The engineer in me wants to over-engineer everything, sorry.)

3267 2018-04-17 17:39:06 That is a lot of hope! Is there any left for the BIG American carmakers or is all hope gone there. Are they too close to the oil companies? Personally I hope Tesla make it.

3269 2018-04-17 17:39:04 It is the EPA not the fricking CIA!! Perhaps P is just worried about someone hearing him make back door dirty deals w/big oil corps
3270 2018-04-17 17:39:04 Not really a company having spent 8 billion building a heavy oil refinery is not going to take in light oil as the inputs are simply not compatible. Moreover the margins on heavy are much higher and the waste products far less
3271 2018-04-17 17:38:53 Coconut oil and vasaline works too !
3272 2018-04-17 17:38:50 Thanks! But if you know #GrumpyOldBrown then you know his mind is closed on this and he is dug-in and covered with oil. Just like California’s Air, Water and Food.
3273 2018-04-17 17:38:40 I need more bead oil and conditioner
3274 2018-04-17 17:38:38 "We have all these studies. We’ve been studied to death. And still nothing. And really — studied to death. Meaning, a lot of people have died. Have paid the ultimate price. Their lives. It’s obvious the oil companies don’t think about those things or they just don’t care.” 1/5
3275 2018-04-17 17:38:34 Sounds like a leaking float needle, Is the oil level rising? Petrol can wash past the piston rings and end up in the oil, That also wears the bores out rapidly
3276 2018-04-17 17:38:33 Inorite? There I go being all reasonable again. I believe it was over him criticizing Jane Fonda for flying up to Canada to view the tar sands. I pointed out that he was acting like a low brow oil shill, not a journalist. and *poof* No more Baldrey.

3281 2018-04-17 17:37:57 There’s a feral gato that lives in my apartment complex. I once petted him. Now the lil fucker keeps peeing on my door. You can see where the piss dripped from the door to the threshold. At first I thought it was oil, so I touched it. But no, it was cat pee.

3285 2018-04-17 17:37:50 That’s what I was going to say. Supports fracking, talks about “Texas Energy dominance” as though that has to be only about oil and gas. He’s not just a Republican, he’s a bought-and-paid-for fossil fuel patsy. That’s my district. Not voting for him.

3318 2018-04-17 17:34:02 If anyone wants a lesson on how socialism works just look at Venezuela a county with the biggest amount of oil in the World and the citizens are starving to death. Our country has become the biggest and greatest economy in the World with our capitalist system.
3319 2018-04-17 17:33:59 How much opposition are you getting from big oil, which--seeing the lay of the land--has shifted focus from non-renewable energy sources to plastics?  I'm assuming that lobby will fight efforts like this.

3330 2018-04-17 17:32:42 Russia already owns Syrian oil and gas so this goes from Russian manufacturer's  r & d budget. And of course eternal gratitude of wartorn country as Russia came to their rescue with Iran
3331 2018-04-17 17:32:41 SB1 is not causing gas prices to continue to go up. It's cost is set and already there. This is big oil, who calvert supports, jacking up the cost for more profit.

3344 2018-04-17 17:31:37 I wonder about correlation vs causation. Maybe eating spicy dishes counters the desire to eat sugary things or other damaging foods. Or maybe spicy foods contain more olive oil and garlic. I'm curious if it's actually the "spicy" (aka capsaicin) that gives the benefits.

3355 2018-04-17 17:30:37 No need. The oil companies and their investors will be in turmoil because the oil price in Alberta sure will drop dramatically.
3356 2018-04-17 17:30:28 No that will turn the oil to sludge and lock up your engine if you keep doing that. But if you’re looking for an oil change  jiffy lube does $20 oil changes for college students

3367 2018-04-17 17:29:23 I like how the article notes "and it appears no wildlife were affected." I am not sure how they define wildlife but I am guessing that 100,000 litres of oil has and will affect wildlife in the area of the spill.
3368 2018-04-17 17:29:17 Officials in #KP are burning the proverbial midnight oil ahead of #CJ Saqib Nisar’s visit. Will KP get a clean chit? Will see!
3369 2018-04-17 17:29:14 Wizkid is on fire  lord renew my oil like his!!!
3370 2018-04-17 17:29:05 5. Energy and the environment. Oil companies don’t need tax dollars, and environmental pollution can be policed more effectively at the state or local level. 

Savings: $51 billion.
3371 2018-04-17 17:28:55 From GLB chief MEG: Unified Command which is inspecting anchor damage to ACT powerlines  in the Straits of Mackinac says there was no damage to wildlife from the 600 gallon spill of oil used as insulation. Enbridge’s Line 5 is 12
Yards east of ATC lines. Enbridge reports 3 dents
3372 2018-04-17 17:28:53 Utterly worthless as a representative. Exxon Mobile/Big Oil got their money’s worth when they bought #TravelingTom!
3373 2018-04-17 17:28:47 At Nissan getting an oil change. Ugh #adulting.

3375 2018-04-17 17:28:31 That`s good...not taking anything away from that...if you could channel part of your revenue generated from oil to improve dilapidated infrastructure such as roads so as to improve accessibility & boost further development & growth
3376 2018-04-17 17:28:30 That would be the ideal thing to do. Problem is the cost for landowners. Burden should be on the oil company. We could talk all day about this in that province and we would still be talking next week. No one wins but the oil companies
3377 2018-04-17 17:28:30 I imagine historians are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of absurdity and atrocity is mind boggling. They must be exhausted, I am!!!!
3378 2018-04-17 17:28:26 lots and lots of tea tree oil and once it's dry, makeup.
3379 2018-04-17 17:28:25 Good evening sir, we surveil the market on a weekly bases and do engage the Mechanic Unions by enlightening them on the dangers of using and patronising fake engine oils. However, if there are specific complaints on engine oil, it can be brought to the attention of the council.
3380 2018-04-17 17:28:22 I tried Shark oil para naman matagal na yung mga sumpa sa fes. hahaha hopefully maganda kalabasan hahaha
3381 2018-04-17 17:28:16 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
3382 2018-04-17 17:28:10 I don't know, to trigger liberals maybe? That's always great fun. Do you know there's a gun oil called "liberal tears"? Google it.
3383 2018-04-17 17:27:57 Paid $50 for an oil change with no car wash lol smh
3384 2018-04-17 17:27:55 Oil is out!!! Clean energy is in!!!
3385 2018-04-17 17:27:49 @don_pittis What's VLCC LOOP? If you don't know you should. Those acronyms are why KM TM is a doomed business case...not even mentioning the dirty oil discounts or the global glut of US crude now that it can be sold internationally. How all events do conspire...

3390 2018-04-17 17:27:18 He knows what he's doing, like Glenn Beck, Mike Savage etc. I've listened to many real crazy people who have lost their rational mind, & I think he is not like them, he is scripted for political purposes & entertainment $$. Just like 19th Century snake oil conmen, but more nasty.
3391 2018-04-17 17:27:13 Some customer tried stealing a gallon of oil. Lol my GM went off on him 
3392 2018-04-17 17:27:07 Why's #Trudeau promised a foreign oil company #KinderMorgan to override court decisions yet undetermined in #BC #Courts? Basically saying doesn't matter what results are he's already bypassed due process. Plus  we have a independent #environmental review #NEB is flawed #cdnpoli

3399 2018-04-17 17:26:31 Isn't it also mainly about the two oil pipes that intersect in Syria? One being under USA, Turkey control and the other Syrian and Russian?

3401 2018-04-17 17:26:21 I knoI was thinking bout the oil spill but shit lookin slight
3402 2018-04-17 17:26:19 Get some tea tree oil, make sure it’s legitimate. It’s gone speed up the healing process and if there’s any infection it’ll clear it up. It won’t burn, I promise.
3403 2018-04-17 17:26:10 Gett some blotting paper. Pat it whenever you feel oil accumulation. You'll be matte in no time.
3404 2018-04-17 17:26:10 she's with a big italian guy who refuses to use grocery store-bought olive oil
3405 2018-04-17 17:26:00 Awww,but I was looking forward to see some of the changes,like a new transition between Oil Ocean>Lava Reef>Metallic Madness>Titanic Monarch.
3406 2018-04-17 17:25:49 "And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them." -Mark 6:13 #Jesus #God #Bible
3407 2018-04-17 17:25:41 There is still a chance, even more so when a company cuts corners, which Kinder Morgan has done in the past. And we know from the past how devastating it is when an oil tanker sinks or has an accident. The risk is not worth it
3408 2018-04-17 17:25:36 Coconut oil solves 3/4 of my problems
3409 2018-04-17 17:25:36 The oil companies also suffered. The price in Alberta may fall to 1 dollar. Let’s see!
3410 2018-04-17 17:25:34 Oil control moisturisers, garnier has one. Also you could get blotting paper or just mattefying (spelling seems off) powder
3411 2018-04-17 17:25:31 Well, they are part of the plan, key players. It's like trying to turn an oil tanker - it takes a long time just slowing it down, then turning and changing direction
3412 2018-04-17 17:25:28 Talking to this sensuality guru?... of course I know ladies love to get rubbed with cooking oil
3413 2018-04-17 17:25:28 $1600. Driver window wont go up or down. Great body no damage. Needs fluids, oil change, and breaks. Runs great. 

I just don't have the money to put it on the road nor the money to keep insurance on it.
3414 2018-04-17 17:25:24 Been at this place since 11 getting a oil change 
3415 2018-04-17 17:25:23 I believe the book is called 'Ill Wind,' about a rogue oil- consuming microbe that starts consuming all hydrocarbons on the planet after it's used on an oil spill in the SF Bay
3416 2018-04-17 17:25:19 @Frac_osu is it bread with olive oil?
My Ma said that when she was young, her mother would put oil in bread and then just fry it like its nothing lol
3417 2018-04-17 17:25:17 Bio oil น่าจะช่วยได้นะคะ เรากำลังใช้อยู่ แต่ต้องใช้เวลานิดนึงง่ะ แล้วก็เคยเห็นมีคนบอกให้สครับผิวด้วยค่ะ 
3418 2018-04-17 17:25:14 @AndrewBellBNN  Nuttal needs to get off his charts and actually spend time in the oil patch   He has recommended losers for years. No shame
3419 2018-04-17 17:25:11 Crude oil is NOT dilbit.
3420 2018-04-17 17:24:56 He is so pompous and arrogant for being 1-31 as the Browns head coach. Total snake oil salesman. BS artist every time he opens his mouth.
3421 2018-04-17 17:24:56 it's already a corporate socialism handout, they're being given a pass on regulations, a pass on bylaws, a pass on environment & cleanup, and financial incentives keep their wheels greased. the oil & gas industry in alberta is pure corporate socialism. 2B is a drop in the trough
3422 2018-04-17 17:24:53 Bizim köyde fuel oil'den armut yapıyoduk bi ara yemeklik
3423 2018-04-17 17:24:51 @AndrewBellBNN Your opinion on Crew Energy? Where do you think it should be trading at based on today's oil price?

Come on Trump. The world isn't stupid. This is an oil war. America is evil, corrupt, misguided and ignorant.
3428 2018-04-17 17:24:07 So immature of @RachelNotley - she is supposed to be a leader. Because she doesn't like BC not wanting the pipeline she is going to choke of oil and gas! Grow up!
3429 2018-04-17 17:23:57 The one with the oil reserves silly. 
3430 2018-04-17 17:23:39 mozzarella sticks with real mozza is gross......... slimy.... also make sure ur oil is actually hot enough before u cook mozza sticks or else it will just melt

3434 2018-04-17 17:23:13 #ast #astgas  CH doesn't actually say they can't do the "planned further development of the Petisovci project" on it's own, without any dilution.  That's how I'm reading it anyway, and why go to the Oil Cap con and do the podcasts indicating it's on the cards with poss of debt
3435 2018-04-17 17:23:09 Oil & Conversation....
3436 2018-04-17 17:23:08 It seems to me the false chemical attack in Syria and the questionable chemical used in Salisbury + source? - Implies the US+ allies looking for excuse for war- poxy wars in ME = oil & bust to GDP?
3437 2018-04-17 17:23:02 Yup. If he had his way, there would be no trees in the national forests, oil rigs in Lake Tahoe, and strip mining in Yosemite. He has to go.
3438 2018-04-17 17:22:55 Niggas will combine hand soap and baby oil and sell it to men if they could smh
3439 2018-04-17 17:22:54 What do you make of AB not being able to produce a carbiou recovery plan in 5 years but amazingly create legislation in short of 2 weeks that allows AB to restrict oil and gas to BC. #priorities #rolleyes
3440 2018-04-17 17:22:53 Yes all the have to do is come in and destroy the environment to remove the oil
3441 2018-04-17 17:22:50 If you want to know what is happening in Syria and why, try to get hold of a map of the operational and planned oil- and gas pipelines through the area. That is the "real game" that is played by ruthless men.
3442 2018-04-17 17:22:49 I think Alberta isn’t planning to restrict what is flowing through the portion of the pipeline that lies in B.C.  they will only restrict what flows through the Alberta portion, just like B.C. wants to do here...... BC can add all the oil it wants at the border....
3443 2018-04-17 17:22:41 YO I GOT THIS HONEY, LIME, GARLIC AND OLIVE OIL TRICK MY MOM TAUGHT ME. I'M COMING THROUGH!

3447 2018-04-17 17:22:22 #Fluffy killed the pipeline in Eastern Canada to protect Lib seats in Quebec, pleasing provincial Libs and buddy Denis Coderre. So we pay the price because once again Trudeau whored for Quebec. Meanwhile we continue to import 'unethical oil' & risk another Lac Megantic.

3448 2018-04-17 17:22:22 Holy faaack. Is there oil under it?
3449 2018-04-17 17:22:12 They were never socialist. Chavez sought to make changes but they had an overreliance on their oil economy. You may recall Chavez gave heating oil to poor Americans at times. Bad leadership and bad people are different things.

Thought & prayers for you & Mum. Two-cent advice, take/leave it - 2nd opinion, CBD oil & bitter almond kernels & much joy/laughter.
3454 2018-04-17 17:21:44 I had stir fry chicken with bell peppers, scallions and chestnut mushrooms, with some brown basmati rice. Threw in some chilli and lemongrass, smoked garlic, sesame oil and soy sauce. Nom
3455 2018-04-17 17:21:33 Left my house at 8:30 this morning to go get my oil changed. When I was leaving I gave Aubrey a kiss goodbye and said I’d be home soon. His response was “okay, honey, I’ll miss you. Have fun” & this is why I know he’s the best 
3456 2018-04-17 17:21:33 Can auto zone do an oil change ?

3458 2018-04-17 17:20:59 How does one obtain oil money? Is it by owning the land it’s under? I don’t believe bammas just go digging and once they strike it’s easy money.
3459 2018-04-17 17:20:52 No. You empty the oil, then put freah oil in.
3460 2018-04-17 17:20:50 Oil has to be drained and replaced. Then you may have to replace your oil filter as well. If you have a newer vehicles it's likely easier to do it yourself.

3465 2018-04-17 17:20:35 If you give Bashar power over Syria, he increases the economy ten-fold.

If you invite America into your country, they take your oil and leave you with shitty 1950s era tanks

If you let Jews run your cabinet, Muslims will run your Department of Defence

Really isn't that hard
3466 2018-04-17 17:20:35 As I’m waiting for my prescription, I decided to read all of the fish oil bottles. It blows my mind how many fish populations have to be exploited to support this vitamin. I also can’t believe that only 1/4 of the bottles stated they treated their oils for impurities like mercury
3467 2018-04-17 17:20:34 Okay. How bout BC stops using oil and gas. Then you can seperate from a Canada you hate and everything will be amazing there.
3468 2018-04-17 17:20:32 It takes 6 seconds to rub coconut oil on your ankles... jus sayin
3469 2018-04-17 17:20:29 For 3/4 of my life and I'm older than I look, I have said take the value of oil away and let the ME alone solve their problems. NO weapons sales giveways etc.
3470 2018-04-17 17:20:21 And she needs an oil change but shes gonna have to wait rill friday

3475 2018-04-17 17:20:07 Now I remember why I hate cooking/eating fish!
It splutters like crazy and it feels like the entire kitchen had a hot oil shower. Disgusting.
It takes thrice the time to clean than cooking and eating out together.
Chiii thuuu 
3476 2018-04-17 17:20:01 The US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released numbers last week that show the outdoor recreation industry comprises 2 percent ($373.7 billion) of the entire 2016 U.S. Gross Domestic Product. That means it's bigger than agriculture & mining, oil, and gas extraction.
3477 2018-04-17 17:20:01 Can 100000% confirm CASTOR OIL is the shit. My eyelashes have never been longer & I put a little in my shampoo and it's made my hair longer.
3478 2018-04-17 17:19:53 If Alberta's threats to BC oil supply threatens First Nations is this not an oil embargo against Soverign Nations? Is the proposed use of Military might not a threat to Soverign Nations as well? Who can trust Canada as a peace builder with these displays of contempt to Charter!
3479 2018-04-17 17:19:53 That data is major Oil..
3480 2018-04-17 17:19:36 is a oil change the same as just putting more oil in your car? QTNA
3481 2018-04-17 17:19:33 Thank YOU for being a wonderful wine club member. Let us know what you think of the olive oil once you have a chance to try it. Cheers!
3482 2018-04-17 17:19:24 Their pine oil bar is kind of incredible, FYI.
3483 2018-04-17 17:19:23 OK then the sales have to stop. Oil needs to have the value of sand. No trade agreements with them either. Give them nothing. Yemen is making me sick. The Syria thing? That's about oil pipelines. Everything revolves around oil.
3484 2018-04-17 17:19:21 Question:  Which nation-states will be the ultimate winners and losers with the current decline in oil prices? 

Congrats on the new book!
3485 2018-04-17 17:19:03 Do you really think that Doug Ford will come in and stop taxing gas? Even then, taxes are only part of the price - the increase in oil prices and the exchange rate (oh, and the demand for corporate profits) also impact your transportation costs.

3489 2018-04-17 17:18:55 Again, our government are taking care of us, haters will say oil, yes we are using our oil for our luxury.

3495 2018-04-17 17:18:04 Just drove home while listening to @cbcradio program about climate change skepticism. The 3 callers I heard terrified me w/ their comments re- buying oil by barrel, ocean volcanoes & flat earth

3509 2018-04-17 17:16:41 I'm not underestimating, I recognize it's importance. There's still more to you.  You can dig into the endothelial function research on your own time. At least that oil is followed up by a salad. Keep doing what you're doing then.

3525 2018-04-17 17:14:41 They sold you all snake oil in 2015. It did not heal any of the afflictions they inserted into your heads. If you buy it again this time,you will only end up the biblical fool who easily parts with his franchise.

3568 2018-04-17 17:09:41 Israel "captured" the Golan Heights from #Syria in the Six Day War of 1967. The UN subsequently asked Israel to return the land to Syria, but of course Israel refused. Massive oil reserves have since been found in this area. Israel & allies profiting. Tragic situation for Syria.
3569 2018-04-17 17:09:40 Iam sure your doing your part as well, after all your home is currently located at in a old river basin ... there is nothing wrong with attempting to lower Canada’s oil and coal consumption.

3574 2018-04-17 17:09:03 I assume @markhumeglobe @AJWVictoriaBC et al support Alberta’s bill to restrict oil to B.C. They hate Alberta oil, want it left in the ground, and don’t want it transported off BC coast. Now they’re getting what they want, right? Blame them for $2/lt gas prices.
3575 2018-04-17 17:09:03 You need more of that lavender oil 
3576 2018-04-17 17:08:59 They forbid the US from entering and from stealing Syria's oil, and you can see how well that went.

3614 2018-04-17 17:03:52 The aeticle I read said that it breaks plastic bottles down to the original PET so that they can be truly recycled (like aluminum) instead of being repurposed for fibers. This could reduce the oil being used to make new PET products.

You've ruined a generation of people (like my mother) and now our relationship is ruined. You are snake oil salesmen. Can't wait for Fox to burn to the ground. FU.

3645 2018-04-17 17:01:38 That he's protecting his Russian interests! They need Syria as a Mediterranean Port for oil and strategic reasons, and America wants that cheap oil from Exxons Russian fields! Wasn't the taking of Kuwait to avoid oil transportation taxes?

A NEPRA team submitted its report on load-shedding by @KElectricPk to authorities today, which found that the primary cause of load-shedding was not operating power plants on oil.
3647 2018-04-17 17:01:22 That's stupid who gave uranium , skolkovo , Iran deal , cut military funding for illegals  , gave Europeans money to fight Russian propaganda, obstructing oil production while purchasing Russian and Iranian oil . Who sold lukoil ? Steel mines . Democrats

3650 2018-04-17 17:01:01 What criteria did they use to select national oil. The company is not even listed in NSE. What are their performance in profit, management etc?

3661 2018-04-17 16:59:47 kak @ImanAbdulRahim last question  kalau kita pakai hado labo cleansing oil, mmg muka akan jadi lebih berminyak? or because kita pakai too much moisturizer? a bit confused 
3662 2018-04-17 16:59:44 Do you have tea tree oil

3664 2018-04-17 16:59:29 If you wanna help stop bombing Syria - give back the oil - stop the sanctions (which only hurt the people) and GET OUT OF SYRIA!
3665 2018-04-17 16:58:41 What’s up with the price of gas?? Domestic production is way up, blaming it on Syria is pure BS. Syria hasn’t exported oil in years. Looks like the more money we’re supposed to be earning, is earmarked for Big Oil. Hello! Mr. President?
3666 2018-04-17 16:58:36 Cleansing oil biore dah nak habis. Tapi macam tak power sangat mungkin sebab ada mineral oil. Try hat lain lah pulak
3667 2018-04-17 16:58:33 I just love being female and going to car places. These motherfuckers just tried to act like I needed a $92 oil change til I said I was leaving then magically I don’t “HAVE” to have that one

3669 2018-04-17 16:57:54  biko leave Ayedee. This thing is not normal anymore; people have been eating before him without spilling oil all over their shirts.
3670 2018-04-17 16:57:53 nice work with oil and $SPX you have been spot on. Do you think $natgas has bottomed out here? That 2.50 - 2.55 area has continued to be a huge trampoline in terms of support, but can't seem to hold over 2.75 - 2.80
3671 2018-04-17 16:57:48 maybe grab forbes mag for top 500 companys...i didnt get the 22 million dollar write off......with 2400.00 ill see new tires and a oil change.. for my truck, spare car and motorcycle FLUCKING shady deal .. give to the rich..and screw everybody else putin shove his hand up
3672 2018-04-17 16:57:28 Want to talk about corporate welfare look to Quebec and Bombardier reaping Canadian give outs for decades! Oil pays back big time!!! Weasel Weaver has lost the war on Canadian prosperity and he’s not happy! The mad scientist blackmailer!!
3673 2018-04-17 16:57:19 bisa di mix, tiap oil 2 tetes
3674 2018-04-17 16:57:04 We are in fact - doing exactly just that through our climate leadership plan to protect the environment. And producing the most ethical oil along with strong labour laws that protect our workers in constructive collaboration w/ our energy industry.  #ableg
3675 2018-04-17 16:57:02 I need a nap!! I need them to hurry up with this oil change!  And don’t come back telling me I need something else!! 
3676 2018-04-17 16:56:43 Point well taken. On a related note, the West Virginia state return for a part year resident is somewhat challenging. Presumably difficult for someone that changes their own oil.

3680 2018-04-17 16:56:17 Hot oil massage once a week with castor mixed with coconut or olive oil helps, also take vitamin B complex pills, they’re really good for hair growth (consult with doc first) 
Sometimes hair fall happens from lack of nutrition (eg: crash diet etc)
3681 2018-04-17 16:56:14 I had a beard for a few years, back in the day.  I never needed to oil it.
3682 2018-04-17 16:56:12 They’ve found massive amounts of oil in #Syria ... history is repeating itself ... question is what will we do to change the outcome ... no more never ending wars
3683 2018-04-17 16:56:00 @CBCOntarioToday everyone seems to think that climate change is just one thing.  What if it is in part underwater volcanos, part burning oil, part cutting down forests, part aliens, part the plan of the God(s) you believe in, and part everything else? Not just one thing.
3684 2018-04-17 16:55:54 Wonder if they want him to send it back @PutinRF_Eng 
Funny all this, then now
Makes u really wonder what they all want
Figure Israel, land
From what I hear America a pipeline as everywhere else UK most likely oil from it

3693 2018-04-17 16:55:23 I prefer responsible business ownership over headless oil spending any day.
3694 2018-04-17 16:55:18 Those wind turbines look so much better than oil rigs don’t they? Bird killing lovers think so.

3699 2018-04-17 16:55:05 Oil companies know the energy transition is coming. As Canadians, how we will navigate it? Pretending it isn't happening probably won't end well. #justtransition
3700 2018-04-17 16:54:59 Israel will try to stop Iran as much as they can from forming a Shia crescent (direct land line Lebanon to Tehran). Meanwhile in the north, Russia, US and Turkey are duking out control over oil wells. So the war is far from over, just the lines are being redrawn.

3703 2018-04-17 16:54:42 We should be proud that the world's need for oil is still increasing?  What?
3704 2018-04-17 16:54:39 Girl also!! Look into a serum to help strengthen and thicken your lashes! You can always go with a brand lash serum, but you can also just go with castor oil, you put It on your lashes at night before bed and wash It off in the morning, it’s a charm!
3705 2018-04-17 16:54:37 @PUBG OIL .... the new map needs oil !
3706 2018-04-17 16:54:25 Pls it was dems who rather spend money on welfare for illegals instead of military , why drew a red line and didn't enforce it allowing Russia and Iran into Syria ,who stopping oil production while purchasing Russian and Iranian oil . Who gave Russia skolkovo ?
3707 2018-04-17 16:54:21 Its all about oil and pipelines. Possibility of oil in Golan heights that Israel wants. Pipeline to run from Iran into Syria.
3708 2018-04-17 16:54:15 My 2 penny on #cashcrunch

3709 2018-04-17 16:54:01 At last a member of the minority community slapped the government in the face. Normally the parliamentarians are from.minorities are apologists living off the smel off am oil rag
3710 2018-04-17 16:53:54 Transports doing well lately doesn't exactly support the "risk off" narrative either. Especially with oil going higher.
3711 2018-04-17 16:53:51 My favorite pizza to get is olive oil based and has chicken, spinach, mushrooms, onions, roasted garlic, black olives, mozzarella and feta cheese 
3712 2018-04-17 16:53:49 Hi Jyoti, coconut oil is run in the facility, but no other nuts.  So glad you found our new clean Organic Frostings and hope you like them!
3713 2018-04-17 16:53:35 Norman, isn't BC's strategy just thin veneer for waiting KM out to pack up and leave? It would be no different than Alberta stopping shipments to BC and then saying, "Oh we're going to let the courts decide if we can restrict oil". The answer is already known in both cases.
3714 2018-04-17 16:53:33 Getting an oil change  where is my NEW man when i need one
3715 2018-04-17 16:53:30 Nah we're not that financially strong. Never gonna happen unless we get taken over by Arab oil merchants
3716 2018-04-17 16:53:28 Govt wants to set up a very big oil processing project at Nanar in Ratnagiri and opposition parties wants to oppose. No one is discussing pros and cons of this project in detail

3718 2018-04-17 16:52:36 Let me go get this oil changed finally
3719 2018-04-17 16:52:32 When your skin is dry, it’ll produce more oil to try to fix it which will cause breakouts (not to mention the fact that it will look tired and dry too). I use Nivea skin cream (specifically made in Germany cause the formulas vary), you can get it on amazon! It works really well.

3724 2018-04-17 16:51:38 Yeah 76% down - a shocker. These Biotech/Pharma things are often just Lottery Gambles and have to be the worst Stocks around. Miners and Oil much better !! (and that's not saying much in many cases). I hope no one had catastrophic damage.
3725 2018-04-17 16:51:27 Gotta go get an oil change; hella not excited to sit and wait for them to get done with it 
3726 2018-04-17 16:51:19 Leaks are another important reason to use alternate clean energy sources and wean ourselves off of oil.

Chernobyl? Iraq oil fires? Japan Earth quake? Hoping so
3728 2018-04-17 16:51:11 Its not to hurt the poorer provinces, its to get them to work with Ab. Quebec takes a big share of the payment while blocking Energy east and supporting bc in blocking the km line. If they don’t like Ab oil then they don’t need their allowance from Ab, which is derived from oil.
3729 2018-04-17 16:50:59 I thought an oil change was maybe $25. Turns out they’re not

3732 2018-04-17 16:50:50 Grain is exported by train ... oil is exported by train ... lumber exported by train ... train goes through indigenous  treaty territory ... see where we are headed?
3733 2018-04-17 16:50:50 I still have money from Oracle only. All my stocks are cm BAC oil stuffs ETF too. No more to load. Tonight IBM could bring the Tech up tomorrow or not the think about Oracle or no
3734 2018-04-17 16:50:46 A lot of oil money...oops!  Did I say that out loud?
3735 2018-04-17 16:50:40 Also, try calming things like lavender oil collars, etc. Not oil directly on her. But I've had anxiety/aggressive dogs and had to do the same. It's hard on them, they want so badly not to be afraid. If I can help, let me know. I'll send you some things. 
3736 2018-04-17 16:50:31 There’s Amazon Reef in the area where @Total wants to drill. @Total we won’t allow you drilling for oil there. #AmazonReefSecret

3739 2018-04-17 16:50:13 What is the test to determine well status, if not productivity? In other words, how do operators determine well status if not based on whether or not the well is capable of producing oil and gas?
3740 2018-04-17 16:49:56 I hope CO own goals it and drives the oil companies in the state to move out.
3741 2018-04-17 16:49:54 Toner is great for both hydrating your skin and minimizing your pores! I like the Prim and Proper one because it has Tea Tree Oil in it (which takes down redness/calms any breakouts you have) 3. Moisturizer - it is SO IMPORTANT to moisturize your face, even if you have oily skin!
3742 2018-04-17 16:49:45 Yeah, too many people don’t realize how hard you Albertans worked to put all that oil in the ground.

3748 2018-04-17 16:49:20 Most Awkward was when my uncle visited after a trip to Kingsmouth. I was covered in zombie blood, had to explain to him that I got caught in helping a friend with their car. Good thing rotted blood looks like oil. 

For you, What's something you are really bad at?

Assad said, "No".
So, West funded/armed Sunni Al Qaida to oust Shia Assad. 
Else, Assad & his people were happy, modern & pro-West.

3763 2018-04-17 16:47:52 The biggest cost to refiners is the cost of oil, it's a commodity going in and commodities going out, there is no price differentiator for the feed stock or the refined product that allows enough margin to finance the capex required to build new capacity in small markets.
3764 2018-04-17 16:47:44 Well, coyotes aren't sponsored by the biggest oil & gas company in the world...
3765 2018-04-17 16:47:38 I wish the federal government acted more on systemic grain/food delays due to rail logistics than they act on oil in pipes.  Money before global food security right ?  @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley  hurry and move more oil while ppl starve. @L_MacAulay @MarcGarneau

Has anyone noticed the trail of "democracy" we left in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Yemen?
3769 2018-04-17 16:46:55 Oil?
3770 2018-04-17 16:46:38 True! 
Plus #SaudiAramco is the only #oil company thats regional among the list.
3771 2018-04-17 16:46:38 Never fails, go for a simple oil change then they wanna upsell you on the add-ons. Bruh just change my oil please
3772 2018-04-17 16:46:33 A girl just walked in precision and gone ask do they do oil changes(I think it’s on the sign) then the dude who work here asked has she been here before she gone say yeah, y’all need to put the Coronas down man

3774 2018-04-17 16:46:29 Besides the obvious... please get that checked out...Um, just essential oil that sh*t. 
3775 2018-04-17 16:46:18 I've had 2 major panic attacks today one was justifiable when Shannon didn't come home from school on time but the other there was no reason for.That's the first time in weeks since starting on CBD oil.Might be time to up the dose .
3776 2018-04-17 16:46:15 Well I get pretty turned on when he’s in all that medieval gear and when he talks about how to change oil in his car
3777 2018-04-17 16:46:14 ex0-l and army = oil and water
3778 2018-04-17 16:46:12 Unless you consider him apologizing for our oil industry offensive to French media , which many Canadians do find obtrusive .
3779 2018-04-17 16:46:09 What happened? We believed in a snake oil salesman!! Not surprisingly, we got bit! The ?? is, for how long?

3781 2018-04-17 16:45:26 My hunch is wood bio fuel encourages  deforestation around the world ,  virgin forests replaced by one species of tree, a bit like the entire sustainable ? Palm oil tree crop.
So regardless of its carbon print dont think it can be justified as green energy ?
3782 2018-04-17 16:45:25 We’re defining “work” as being the product of a lucky sperm cell produced by a relatively well-off man who happened to develop oil leases at a time when they were heavily subsidized by public spending? Because the Koch fortune is 90% timing, 10% sufficient capital to use timing.
3783 2018-04-17 16:45:22 @financialpost criticize all you want. The pipelines are not our national interest. Its in the interest of foreign companies. Third largest oil reserve. Brought Alberta in debt, almost the highest gas prices in the world. Make it in our interest and we'll support @JustinTrudeau
3784 2018-04-17 16:45:20 @Thorne_Research why hemp CBD oil?  Isn’t that not as efficacious as cannibinoid CBD oil?
3785 2018-04-17 16:45:09 I'm looking forward to the "Oil Company Makes Everyone Sick" pieces replacing the "Silverlake Hipster" pieces at LA Times.
3786 2018-04-17 16:45:04 No you do were did the all iraqi oil went and still go now and do you guys pay for it you colonize and invide our land and when you guys left you put your puppets on power and then play the victem card
3787 2018-04-17 16:45:04 Gonna let bio oil do its thing for 3mos straight  I fell off the first go round when I started noticing changes only for my skin to get mad at me for being lazy... that ends tewday. I want my clear skin back.

3791 2018-04-17 16:44:25 Yeah, illegal immigrant votes are the reason that all those Dems are taking seats from the GOP in deep-red country over the last few months.  People are SICK of the lies and snake oil that have been sold to them by the Charlatan-in-Chief.

3794 2018-04-17 16:44:03 She surrounds herself with pro-oil people.  How many people in advisory positions from the oil field?  How many people in her government advocating for Alberta's oil industry?  It's about actions, and Notley has been staunchly pro-oil in her actions.

3796 2018-04-17 16:44:01 ON THE CONTRARY. THE SLANT DRILLING WAS NEVER MSM REPORTS. YOUR LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OIL IMPACT ON USA ECONOMY AND YOUR LACK OF UNDERSTANDING GEOPOLITICS IS YOUR PERSONAL DECISION. IT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH

3801 2018-04-17 16:43:16 Have you tried the cannabis from dispensaries? Do you know what's abailable? Ever tried hemp oil? Hemp hearts? Cannabinoid have a saturation point, adding more does little after a certain point. Unlike opioids it doesn't affect respiration nor lead to death.
3802 2018-04-17 16:43:14 ごま油。。。くっそ。
3803 2018-04-17 16:43:09 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
3804 2018-04-17 16:43:07 Can you really consider yourself a vegan if you drive a car? I mean, oil comes from dinosaurs, doesn't it?

3810 2018-04-17 16:42:05 I think we are currently heading towards an eventual Association Agreement (perhaps more flexible than EEA and less likely to piss off Norway et al) and it will take a lot to turn the oil tanker at this stage. If it does turn, then who's to say it won't turn all the way to Remain

Sleep well tonight

3815 2018-04-17 16:41:19 The tugboat company that caused the anchor strike is facing a civil suit. However, we have not removed the real risk of damage. Under these weather conditions, these accidents are bound to happen. And oil will carry across many miles of shoreline.
3816 2018-04-17 16:41:18 Man I just can’t warm up to this idea... I know it’s not terribly different from creamer with oil, buuut.
3817 2018-04-17 16:41:07 therefore GOD, even THY GOD, hath anointed THEE with The Oil of gladness above THY fellows.  1.10 And, THOU, LORD, in the beginning hast
3818 2018-04-17 16:41:04 Thanks genius. The price of oil is only one factor in the price of gasoline. This low info banter is base twitter.
3819 2018-04-17 16:40:59 แคร์มากนะ 
3820 2018-04-17 16:40:50 I'd wonder if it is anerobic and what parts of plastic, which is a petroleum polymer it "eats". If yes and things that are inherent in petroleum, we have the perfect terrorist act against the limited universe of supergiant oil fields like Cantarell in  Mexico and gahwar in Saudi.
3821 2018-04-17 16:40:48 Mi tanque de aceite claramente está pinchado porque pierdo oil de a litros. Salu2
3822 2018-04-17 16:40:38 @Bighugh53 Where do u purchase your wonderful CBD oil from, if u don’t mind me asking?
3823 2018-04-17 16:40:36 Cars can neither run on wine nor the whines of social justice eco-warriors.

When we cut off your oil and blockade you, grab one, shove his face into your gas tank, beat him until he whines and see what you get.

Then have a nice walk. And freeze in the dark too.

3825 2018-04-17 16:40:22 Combine your regular lotion with sweet almond oil. Exfoliate with a sugar scrub. Rub lemon juice or potato juice on the affected areas.
3826 2018-04-17 16:40:19 I have the same birb but am reluctant on feeding him oily food (except cheese, I can't feed him enough cheese lmao). Could he get diarrhea from pancake oil?
3827 2018-04-17 16:40:13 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
3828 2018-04-17 16:40:13 You are doing a good job but this is utter BS. Cannabis was only made illegal so oil could replace hemp. You need to do some real research before you put out BS misinformation.  You have a voice now, use it wisely.
3829 2018-04-17 16:40:11 Mix baking powder in coconut oil. Lightly massage on ur face n hands n leave it on for 5-10 min n wash. I bet ur skin will look fresh n gori n dont forget to moisturize.
3830 2018-04-17 16:40:08 This is like watching someone hide under the sheets while their house burns down. Most of the denial comes from the Koch Brothers and the Oil lobby who spend millions spreading misinformation. In Canada the Fraser inst. Spreads these lies for profit.
3831 2018-04-17 16:39:51 I guess nicotine in a vape pen is like oil

3835 2018-04-17 16:39:05 Everything is always possible but on Iran there were serious reasons that made it very unlikely regardless of all the preparations and planning. Namely the effect on oil prices and global opposition (under Obama). These reasons don't apply now.
3836 2018-04-17 16:39:05 @trish_regan So Trish, it's all about oil?
Made me think about Robert Redford's line at the end of 3 Days of the Condor! I guess some things never change.
3837 2018-04-17 16:38:56 What does @ArtBergmann think they make his records out of?
Sunshine and daffodils?
It's oil.
3838 2018-04-17 16:38:54 Have fun with those lawsuits, you snake oil selling POS.
3839 2018-04-17 16:38:45 Oh, Christ. I thought I was looking at the calcinated remains of two puffins after a terrible oil spill before the sign registered.
3840 2018-04-17 16:38:45 The allegation is that 20 years ago Gyárfás commissioned a leader of a Hungarian oil maffia group to “liquidate his biggest business rival,” Fenyo.
3841 2018-04-17 16:38:35 Let the punishment fit the crime. Lock her up until oil flows through TMX
3842 2018-04-17 16:38:12 They must be gutted lol! Blue day, wonder what will Happen when they gush some oil 
3843 2018-04-17 16:38:09 5% of today's oil goes to the creation of plastic. Pre plastic, we got along with glass, wood, and paper. Let's outlaw plastic! Or tax the he__ out of it.

3847 2018-04-17 16:37:58 And the zoo Nigeria slave masters are busy negotiating with Jubrin Mohammadu Buhari the cloned president of the zoo Nigeria on the areas where oil and gas is in Biafra land.
3848 2018-04-17 16:37:44 It might be an option for Alberta to ship the oil, for overseas, via a pipeline through the USA & shipped from Seattle or Portland.
3849 2018-04-17 16:37:37 Speaking of logrolling, wtf does offshore oil drilling have to do with vaping indoors?

3852 2018-04-17 16:37:22 The US has no interest in the wars-for-profit in the Middle East- since the oil seized isnt used in the US but sold by the Globalists to Europe & other places. Your taxes pay for this Globalist private army& US soldiers die to enrich these traitors-who dont even pay taxes.#qanon

3859 2018-04-17 16:37:14 Okay. A) That's hardly obsession, they are twins after all. You're making the mistake of assigning adult logic to child like actions – mixing the proverbial oil and water.
B) They can be interested in other people as well as each other. It is possible.
3860 2018-04-17 16:37:06 Russia's Energy Minister Novak Says  Russia And Iran Could Extend Bilateral Deal On Oil Supplies For Five Years - Tass
3861 2018-04-17 16:37:04 You understand that the pipeline is a vital part of the Feds carbon reduction plan? The deal was AB put in a carbon tax, impose caps on oil sands etc in exchange we get a pipeline that will help fund green projects. No pipeline, no fed carbon reduction plan. Period.
3862 2018-04-17 16:36:36 But Denmark has almost no oil and their standard of living eclipses ours. Their wages are so high that they have to pay people to go to university. Are you saying that Scottish people are inherently less able than Danes? The price of oil is rising again.

3869 2018-04-17 16:36:15 
3870 2018-04-17 16:36:00 Nope.  I mean the approval of two other pipeline projects that will give the west excess pipeline capacity and the long term forecast in oil that made Transcanada cancel the project.  They didn't hide their reasons for the cancellation if you bothered to look up the reasons.
3871 2018-04-17 16:35:59 Only three ingredients: corn, corn oil, and salt. Also excellent fire starters. FRITOS CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE! #superfood
3872 2018-04-17 16:35:57 @Labdoor 
How did you test the WHC UnoCardio 1000 fish oil that you rank as number one?  How are EPA-DHA expressed?  What analytical instruments were used?  Same product tested on #IFOS and showed different results as meeting label specs.  Did you use AOCS methods? #misbranding
3873 2018-04-17 16:35:48 Enough to counter balance what it will do to us on oil prices??
3874 2018-04-17 16:35:45 Now that @JustinTrudeau has made these comments we can be sure That no pipeline will  be built, Canadian oil production will go down, gas prices will skyrocket, and @jjhorgan will be soon letting foreign tankers on "his" coast.
3875 2018-04-17 16:35:39 In 2014 the price of oil was well over $100 compared to $70 today.

3882 2018-04-17 16:35:04 Add this to Pruitt's connections with oil/gas and Wheeler's direct lobbying for Energy Fuels Resources (as part of Faegre Baker Daniels) and it "raises some speculations."
Wonder if they have FOIA-able communications verifying coordination.
3883 2018-04-17 16:34:47 I love how BC claims it is unconstitutional for AB to restrict the flow of oil to BC, but itsn't unconstitutional for BC to block the flow of oil from AB. Funny reasoning.

3889 2018-04-17 16:34:08 Also 'snake oil wonder drug' is a nice simplification, but what if it wasn't snake oil, but a legitimate drug from a very unethical / unreliable source and it was the only theoretical option? What if you, but not the parents, doubted the seemingly legitimate studies on it?

3891 2018-04-17 16:34:05 Doesn’t anyone else want to keep the oil in Canada? Refine it into gas in Canada and stop paying so much for gas refined in the USA? Let’s keep our resources until they have max value, instead of shipping raw materials and provide even more jobs to Canadians.
3892 2018-04-17 16:34:03 Making my brother go with me to get an oil change Bc the guys always pressure me into buying so many services there

3896 2018-04-17 16:33:38 Canadians are in favor of the pipeline, that's democracy. Protest all you want, but majority rules. It's in the national interest to twin the pipeline as we're not ending the use of oil anytime soon and should be moving our product to market, all while protecting our land/oceans.

3907 2018-04-17 16:32:47 Next 10 years China will be "Power" to reckon; world bigest economy, 1.3 billion population &400 million people in middle class equivalent to US poulation, largest importer of oil, LNG, coal, minerals, largest exporter of finished goods;steel, autos, computers, chemicals, IT, etc
3908 2018-04-17 16:32:37 InfoChip's tags are chemically etched & designed to withstand harsh conditions found in mines, on oil rigs, & other #industrial areas.
3909 2018-04-17 16:32:32 Great more litheum we need to find a way to bury to protect the environment.  Takes thousands of tons of gas, oil and electricity to build these buses that will take over 75 years to pay for themselves then the batteries go?
3910 2018-04-17 16:32:31 Bit of beard oil and a comb and it’ll be fine
3911 2018-04-17 16:32:28 this happened to me.. my dad said it just needed oil and he said the problem was fixed.. my car broke down two days later fkdjsj
3912 2018-04-17 16:32:27 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
3913 2018-04-17 16:32:26 Edomites have one reason....Destruction of Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa so they can steal oil.
3914 2018-04-17 16:32:12 Scott Moe is a buffoon. He's forgoing millions from feds just to be belligerent about carbon pricing, he's dragged his feet for three years on marijuana instead of figuring out how to optimize the windfall, and now he's costing us millions in oil trade because he's a baby.
3915 2018-04-17 16:31:54 Don’t forget we are all off buying avocados, coconut oil and 12-quid-per-box cereal.
3916 2018-04-17 16:31:49 6am office work... cleaned out my car... got an oil change... ate a lunchable for breakfast... mailed my taxes... morning nap  #adulting
3917 2018-04-17 16:31:31 The government of New Zealand has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Paul Wesley in a needlerun net wig.
3918 2018-04-17 16:31:22 energy from moving water, instead of a windmill on a stream, make a circe of pipe say 10" - w inner propellers w solar power and move the water round and round, or a water substitute, not oil, and create limitless clean energy for ever, everywhere?
3919 2018-04-17 16:31:21 Punks don't use Celsius or Fahrenheit. They just c whether coconut oil is solid or liquid.
3920 2018-04-17 16:31:20 So I go to @jiffylube to get a “fast oil change” and they quote me over an hour. So.... when does the jiffy come in? #slowlube #stupid
3921 2018-04-17 16:31:19 Irag = gop=revenge + oil control/money Syria=Russia=US=concerns about citizens = shut door policy? Videos clearly show 3 drop area not 1 ???
3922 2018-04-17 16:31:18 God I hope not. I prefer to live in a world where nobody changes their own oil.
3923 2018-04-17 16:31:17 Robert Oldman, 40, now a resident of the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution, what was you going to do with McDonald's vegetable oil?

3925 2018-04-17 16:31:05 Got about an hour to kill while my car is getting an oil change / check up. Instantly regret not being brave enough to take my Switch out in public.
3926 2018-04-17 16:31:04 @arunjaitley sir banks cash deposit charges are too high, i.e. Rs. 120 per lac, this is very high sir, I am oil and gas dealer my customer give cash to me what I should do ?

3931 2018-04-17 16:30:49 The US far outproduces Syria in oil production. Get over yourselves with this “currency” crap. The American currency is stable, thats why its used. Not bc the US spends trillions fighting wars for it.
3932 2018-04-17 16:30:37 Exactly. Since getting cut Dez has shown precisely *why* he got cut. That dude is toxic, and his toxicity was bearable so long as he produced. He stopped producing, and it became unbearable. Simple. But Fish has to go all drama queen to drive clicks. What a snake oil salesman.

3935 2018-04-17 16:30:25 And Trudeau apologizes in France that he can't shut down our oil industry...how about some pride in our ethical, environmentally sound extraction of oil the world needs...he just doesn't get it...can't wait till this useless PM is voted out...
3936 2018-04-17 16:30:25 FYI - the analogies I'm using when describing #cryptocurrency to my consulting clients are things like frequent flyer points, casino chips, even barrels of oil #moneysummit

3938 2018-04-17 16:30:07 England's refusal to quit did force Germany to keep active Divisions in western Europe and Africa. That didn't stop the invasion of the USSR, but did frustrate it, and forced Germany to change strategy in search of oil instead of  mid east oil. 
Also facilitated US entry.
3939 2018-04-17 16:29:55 Keeping our oceans free of oil drilling & pollution!
3940 2018-04-17 16:29:52 I have an ethical pension. No war machinery or oil. Might not get the best return but I can sleep at night.

3942 2018-04-17 16:29:49 I still love the trade. Weird season for oil, sad year for Larsson. Cap issues if kept Hall and he would be the 3rd best player on this team. Maybe 4th.
3943 2018-04-17 16:29:38 As if some customer has just ordered ham egg and chips and then complained about the food and said she was allergic to grease?! don't order something that 2/3 of the items on that meal are cooked in oil! Silly cunt 
3944 2018-04-17 16:29:36 “Oil Sands” not tar sands!
3945 2018-04-17 16:29:23 @SteeleAndUngar Public comment periods are required by law. What is the force of law if the opinions of the overwhelming majority are ignored? Re: Bears Ears, Net Neutrality, oil pipelines..........
3946 2018-04-17 16:29:11 the whole charade over Syria comes as a DIRECT result of Hilary Clinton and her inbuilt hatred of Libya,Syria and other countries because THEY wanted to drop the US $ in their oil dealings which in Libya meant introducing the Golden Dinar.
3947 2018-04-17 16:29:10 Robert Oldman, 40, of Wilmington needed vegetable oil for his hair clippers. So he decided to go to his McDonald's with a gun. They said no.

3951 2018-04-17 16:28:40 On top of the $billions in subsidies the Alberta oil industry already  gets are we now going to give them more to build a pipeline that doesn't  make financial sense?
 Not to mention the tax payer will be on the hook to clean up the tar patch.
3952 2018-04-17 16:28:33 Should have poured boiling oil out the window. Scumbag bastards! They should try working like the rest of us for what we want
3953 2018-04-17 16:28:07 You were caught colluding with Cohn and trump - never disclosed ur relationship to anyone - your a snake oil salesman and con artist hannity and should be fired - let’s get a list of ur sponsors
3954 2018-04-17 16:28:02 I'm basing that on the GDP by industry figures from StatsCan. The entire oil, gas, mining and quarrying sector is about 8%.

3959 2018-04-17 16:27:24 I’m thinking I should bottle my oil blend for relaxed hair. If you know me, you know I have really long healthy relaxed hair.
3960 2018-04-17 16:27:16 I wonder if this relates to Colorado making much more money in cannabis, they are able to step back and see the damage from oil.

3965 2018-04-17 16:26:39 @LeannLeiter It was great to meet you last night at the #WPRT meeting for ordinances.  Thanks for all you do to help in the fight for #CleanAir and keeping the oil and gas companies accountable!
3966 2018-04-17 16:26:35 Thanks to a generous Amazon bday giftcard, I was able to restock a bunch of essential oils and even splurge on two: a bottle of REAL Indian sandalwood, and also real rose absolute. Til now I've had to use sandalwood diluted in oil (30%/70% mix, weak) and synthetic rose.
3967 2018-04-17 16:26:29 Downplaying the conflicts in the Middle East to oil is, totally missing the target. For instance, Saudi Arabia is investing in one of the largest solar panel operations. They’ve been getting away from an oil economy. Russia runs natural gas. It’s about Iran wanting control.
3968 2018-04-17 16:26:28 I'm going to paint an oil self portrait in the style of vermeer and title it "girl with the hoop earring"
3969 2018-04-17 16:26:25 Not hard at all. Concealer and get you some Aloe Vera gel and just set with Rose hip oil

Once when I was 17 my car caught fire (hadn’t put oil in the old lady for at least a year) driving up big cottonwood. 

A passerby stopped to yell “YOUR CAR IS ON FUC*ING FIRE!” Our of her window. Like I was somehow unaware. She then kept on driving

3986 2018-04-17 16:24:37 One more from the public comment: @RepMoe says state's financial problems are past and now heading back in other direction with oil prices being back up. Asks to hold off on sport elimination decision. ... "I hope that Aggie and Lobo athletics can be reprioritized in this state."
3987 2018-04-17 16:24:28 Things that make us gain weight: fried foods, dairy products, meat, nuts, chocolate, candy, cooking oil, pastries, white bread. To lose weight, eliminate these as much as you're able. You'll feel better and stronger inside. More healthy too. Questions?
3988 2018-04-17 16:24:17 you oil cleanse?

4008 2018-04-17 16:22:03 Nobody is arguing that oil isn't useful or extraction isn't profitable. If they weren't, we wouldn't be having this discussion.

If you want to show whether this industry is sustainable, you need to include future / environmental costs.

i was like akooooo I can hahahah don't even care about the oils hahahah
4042 2018-04-17 16:18:27 Is this before or after he was told about total oil, investing a few dollars in Iran.
4043 2018-04-17 16:18:26 It's not hard to find an oil tanker, it's hard to get it back to Falls End without exploding.

4046 2018-04-17 16:17:55 Sheer shilling for big oil.  Shocking.
4047 2018-04-17 16:17:54 If they oil so much they should stop flying, and driving.

4049 2018-04-17 16:17:47 @don_pittis Great viewpoint. I read Canada produces <2%  of world CO2. My point is we must displace world coal use with our cleaner Natural Gas/refined oil products, more impact globally than lessening our already small footprint. Carbon tax punishes this contribution.

4051 2018-04-17 16:17:41 Probably gave olive oil from the tap
4052 2018-04-17 16:17:39 Started taking CBD oil, going for my biweekly infusion.
4053 2018-04-17 16:17:32 chicken flavored rice and brussel sprouts or chicken flavor rice with peas and carrots

I also have regular rice and 3 eggs

I still have pasta, but I am running low on olive oil
4054 2018-04-17 16:17:30 Nope. Old school. You just push it. It’s like your grandad had. Does a brilliant job, stripes the lawn and all that but without fannying about dancing around a lead, remembering to recharge it or filling it with oil. Breathtaking simplicity.
4055 2018-04-17 16:17:24 The Arab Spring was meant to clear the N-African coast from the dictators so the UN could start their European ppl replacement project.
Syria is hot because of the oil pipelines and the new gas pipeline.
There are further no interests at all in that area.
4056 2018-04-17 16:17:23 As long as their is an NDP or liberal Government in BC and a federal liberal government , Alberta will be on the path of de-industrializing which means less oil produced.
4057 2018-04-17 16:17:23 My uncle was trying to fill a position within a oil refinery and trying to meet the diversity quota, found an African American guy that was perfect. Found out the new hire's wife would be perfect for a job (thinking it would be a twofer) turned out his wife was white.
4058 2018-04-17 16:17:18 Left Wing Lunacy. Horgan threatens to limit Alberta’s oil exports. Alberta enacts legislation to limit oil exports. Horgan now threatens to sue Alberta for possibly not exporting something he doesn’t want exported.

4060 2018-04-17 16:16:46 Looks like we're not going to oil painting class any more. That's a pity, I was getting so.good. :-)
4061 2018-04-17 16:16:44 I still want my truffle oil back.  
4062 2018-04-17 16:16:41 maybe if its an oil form although would it even get absorbed?
4063 2018-04-17 16:16:38 The oil companies are waiting until theg are no longer doing business in Alberta so they can walk away from their cleanup responsibilities. Why waste money on a plan you have no intention of delivering on.
4064 2018-04-17 16:16:36 The bottom fell off my car, again, after an oil change. This doesn’t happen when the hubby takes it in. This is why I don’t do these things #mansjob

4068 2018-04-17 16:16:26 I feel this hard. I uploaded our Lucas Oil run as a private video and they took it down and now I have no way of seeing it ever again

4070 2018-04-17 16:16:16 Sure,vote for NO BOMBING SYRIA AND OTHER MIDDLE EAST COUNTRIES RICH OF OIL,so people will have no reason to leave their homeland
4071 2018-04-17 16:16:13 a texas oil company caused this war, and the Canadian federal @liberal_party & @albertaNDP are enabling and encouraging this division. it's very sad and makes Canada seem weak
4072 2018-04-17 16:16:11 Don’t we get most of our refined oil from Washington State?
4073 2018-04-17 16:15:57 @GameGrumps Danny tame that Jew fro with some miracle coconut oil my man, you will be so happy to have that monster on a chain.

4075 2018-04-17 16:15:36 Ok. Should the sea badly affect your appetite, try spaghetti (possibly not overboiled) with just olive oil and lemon juice (a few drops, according to your taste). This is a very old tradition from Naples, sounds weird but tastes good 
4076 2018-04-17 16:15:32 I’m having vivid visions of oil from hamburgers or whatever he’s grilling jumping up on to that material he’s wearing and it all goes up in flames
4077 2018-04-17 16:15:27 had to change the playlist I was listening to bc I didn’t want the guy changing my oil know I was listening to the Lemonade Mouth soundtrack
4078 2018-04-17 16:15:19 I need to go get a oil change like today’s

4082 2018-04-17 16:14:33 When I hire a full-time employee, I'm hiring for life.  It's a PERMANENT increase in my costs.  And it's a permanent costs that my customers might not care about.  (BTW, customers DO care in my business, but probably wouldn't if I were selling oil or ketchup.)
4083 2018-04-17 16:14:32 My cat has been sick and has gotten super picky. He will now only eat tuna. Since he is in early stages of kidney disease, I have to use tuna that doesn't have added salt or phosphate, which means sustainable seas ($36 per 12 pack). I add cat vitamins, coconut oil and rice.
4084 2018-04-17 16:14:30 First time to use an essential oil.

4087 2018-04-17 16:13:53 But do you do a lot of taxes for people who change their own oil?
4088 2018-04-17 16:13:41 Okay, thanks so much! I’ll check out. It’s of those brands. Anything in particular you use to help balance excess oil production?
4089 2018-04-17 16:13:36 With two new pipelines heading east soon why do we need a Trans Mountain pipeline? This is even more poignant  when the east routes will garner better prices for the oil companies.

4100 2018-04-17 16:13:05 That the federal govt is taking on risk that a private corporation isn’t, because oil exports that don’t create many jobs are so important to Trudeau.
4101 2018-04-17 16:13:04 Gas is 2.80 rn we fucking better have found oil in Syria
4102 2018-04-17 16:13:01 We don't need a polar ice cap!  Once it melts, it will be easy to drill for oil there! #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming

4104 2018-04-17 16:12:40 All right, you Alberta MFs.

So you claim Constitutional law gives you the right to ram your pipeline through to our Coast, despite our concerns or objections, but now you claim you have the right to refuse to sell Canada's oil to us? You can't have it both ways, assholes.

1/?
4105 2018-04-17 16:12:38 So....... Trudeau is saying pipelines are in the national interest and the pipeline will be built, then tells French media he wants to get away from oil faster? I have a lot of trouble keeping up here
4106 2018-04-17 16:12:26 ใช่แน่เลยค่ะ แต่ตอนนี้เดเร็คไปแล้วไม่มีโมเม้นมห้หวีดเลยนะคะ ฮืออ
4107 2018-04-17 16:12:23 Yes, cattle, oil, gas, and coal--those are top priorities for Zinke & his friends. Too bad he is willing to sacrifice conservation and public lands for his and friends' selfish interests.
4108 2018-04-17 16:12:19 Well, Keto Chow is made from REAL milk protein, REAL heavy cream and/or avocado oil, REAL Acacia Gum fiber, REAL salt, REAL vitamins and minerals. I think the argument gets hung up on fighting against the heavily processed grain foods most people eat.
4109 2018-04-17 16:12:15 Yep because I don’t change oil but I do a lot of taxes
4110 2018-04-17 16:12:15 does it involve coconut oil and/or mindfulness? <— i am not helping
4111 2018-04-17 16:12:10 I'm sure it has nothing to do with the collapse of oil prices. But if we really want to get picky we need to look at the lack of economic policy of @stephenharper and the @CPC_HQ who put all their eggs in the $150/barrel of oil and lost dramatically. More Con lies. #cdnpoli
4112 2018-04-17 16:12:07 I say I'm at Walmart for an oil change, but really I'm just here to catch up on The Real.

4115 2018-04-17 16:11:58 On top of the $billions in subsidies the Alberta oil industry already  gets are we now going to give them more to build a pipeline that doesn't  make financial sense?
 Not to mention the tax payer will be on the hook to clean up the tar patch
4116 2018-04-17 16:11:45 AB and SK are, implicitly, making the strongest possible case for BC and other jurisdications to phase out fossil fuels as rapidly as they possibly can and shift to renewables. No one wants to be subject to a constant threat of blackmail by their oil and gas suppliers.
4117 2018-04-17 16:11:35 Because oil prices are temporary and labor costs are permanent.  I know I can pass on high oil prices this year -- everyone knows it, customers see the market prices.  But I might not be able to pass on high labor costs next year, but I'll be stuck with them.
4118 2018-04-17 16:11:33 I will pride in my ignorance. Hell! I will even smear it all over my body like oil... lol

4134 2018-04-17 16:11:01 But I would say that Scotland has a much brighter future as part of the UK even without Europe than it has on its own. For example what would’ve happened if we had become independent. The price of oil dropped dramatically within a few months Scotland would be bankrupt.

He is delivering on Trump's promises to Putin's boss, the oil billionaire who is running the show behind scenes.

4146 2018-04-17 16:10:07 I’ve always wondered why the enviros don’t go after eastern oil producers. Follow the $. Alberta’s oil is clean compared to what comes from there. Great video thanks!

4149 2018-04-17 16:09:52 Let’s get something straight. Manchester City FC has made a profit 4 years in a row, which means 4 years in a row we have not used “oil money”. Sheik Mansour did not close his eyes and pick a Championship side at random, he chose a club with history and loyal fans.

4158 2018-04-17 16:09:01 Thanks. People need to stop saying we are taking the oil. America only gets 11% or so of oil from overseas. We are controlling the oil, i.e controlling the country/area
4159 2018-04-17 16:08:50 Funny how badly BC wants the oil currently being pumped through to them.

4164 2018-04-17 16:08:00 Then I guess I would be interested in seeing some explanation of why co's can pass on the price of more expensive oil (e.g.) but can't bear higher labor costs. Neel's point here is, I think, that wages are much stickier than expenses on non-labor inputs for "non-economic" reasons
4165 2018-04-17 16:07:59 That's a surprise. Once again it's Newfoundlanders and Albertans breaking their backs for the ungrateful rest. Madness that these idiots would wanna stop us from getting our oil to market. We should be refining here but en lieu of that this pipeline is a necessity.

4179 2018-04-17 16:05:57 When oil companies go to work in an area they will replenish the land back to its natural state. Grass, trees, rebuilding fences everything...does coal companies??

4181 2018-04-17 16:05:55 Had it been part of a country of sane and sincere people, its hydel power would have been powering, probably, half of the country... but we shall continue to gimmick with expensive furnace oil, gas and now abondoned coal plants...

4184 2018-04-17 16:04:23 @EvanLSolomon @PremierScottMoe why not refine oil in every province?
The surplus sell to Texas at $1.50 liter!
4185 2018-04-17 16:04:23 I saw that it was hard to work with but she said to use with the oil... And same. I like to test things for myself. What works for me doesn’t work for others. And it’s only $28. I can afford to not like it.

4187 2018-04-17 16:03:59 Correction: a previous tweet said Saskatchewan @PremierScottMoe was supporting legislation limiting oil exports to Alberta. The legislation would actually limit exports to B.C. 
We regret the error

4198 2018-04-17 16:02:20 Yeah but oil and the combustion engine are so 19th century. And yes these helped power the 20th century.

4239 2018-04-17 15:59:25 Alberta didn't drive the southern resident orcas to the brink of extinction. There are several very difficult issues that need to be fixed for that population to survive, almost all of them in BC's court to solve. Additional tankers of AB oil are just 1 problem.

4243 2018-04-17 15:59:08 Maybe KE can burn furnace oil in the meantime? It does have that option. Of course it would eat away into its profits. Not cause a loss though. Just saying.

4245 2018-04-17 15:58:49 I just can’t understand the butt hurt. All the guy did was KILL it for the Oil on really really REALLY bad teams. And somehow it’s his fault he got traded? And then went on to show the world how bad a trade that was?!? The coverage of this team....
4246 2018-04-17 15:58:38 Ahhhhh...kind of like "we shoulda took the oil?"
4247 2018-04-17 15:58:35 I will agree on the soil zones but climatic way more than 3. I would say each soil zone has a variability in climate.maybe you would rather refer it to weather zones then. Have traveled this province extensively in my oil patch days and seen a huge swing in weather zones.

4263 2018-04-17 15:56:48 But sending oil overseas means less for here and higher cost here. Sharing is good but don't hurt USA doing it. Already cost is going up

4322 2018-04-17 15:50:03 Major issue there is box freight is the lowest payer in an area dominated by oil and chemical products. Rail is an issue.
4323 2018-04-17 15:50:01 You are the queen of the flip flop you should just be quiet! I remember you at the anti oil protests and the anti pipeline protests only a gold fish would forget!!
4324 2018-04-17 15:49:53 Ya. Coz they are smart. We would do the same if our trading partners were as stupid as us. Eastern Canada buys oil at Brent, Western Canada sells at WCS discounted to WTI, and no pipelines to fix this allowed. So stupid.
4325 2018-04-17 15:49:44 One other curious and monumental shift in oil futures. China will begin making purchases of Brent this year in Yuan, other countries may follow suit which will bring the death of the petro-dollar as reserve currency, possibly war, definitely massive US recession.
4326 2018-04-17 15:49:44 It was not easy and I'm still not over Gretz sale. But it felt like to remain true to the team, I could not cheer for Gretz any longer.

 Not to mention the tax payer will be on the  hook to clean up the tar patch.

4380 2018-04-17 15:43:53 This makes no sense at all. Golan Heights is already under Israeli control. If they want to extract oil from there, they can do so right now. 

Yet another poorly thought out conspiracy theory

Prince/trump's "zero cost to the US taxpayer" + "take the oil"  = no longer technically a war crime?  Don't know the legality of modern "plundering" which makes your "viceroy" incredibly powerful.
4388 2018-04-17 15:42:53 yes the black sea fleet base in Sevastopol is one of the main reasons, oil and gas not so much, but in the end Crimea made the choice to join Russia not the other way around, all the evidence I have seen points to a democratic process.
4389 2018-04-17 15:42:50 I’m getting my oil changed. 
The mechanic seems to be struggling. 
He grabbed giant pliers and now I’m concerned.
4390 2018-04-17 15:42:43 Sure hope BC continues to allow unloading and loading of present oil piped to Burnaby.
4391 2018-04-17 15:42:35 I got my oil changed and the tech turned off my cars stereo and I could not figure out why my music wouldn't play even though my bluetooth was connected. 

I bought this car brand new 3 years ago and had no clue you even could turn it on or off bc I've never tried.

4398 2018-04-17 15:42:06 BC's strategy to block TMx may be unconstitutional. (Feds' dismissal of Energy East might create some uncertainty as to applicability of the national interest test.) Alberta's move to cut off BC's oil supply certainly is unconstitutional. Where're the grownups when we need them?

4445 2018-04-17 15:38:04 Without the Crimea, the Russians would lose a lot of oil, gas & food. And of course the Naval base. Ukraine had shared these resources & to allow Russia the continued use of the naval base.
All this is from memory, so a little rusty.
Can't remember the name of the Naval base.

4448 2018-04-17 15:37:53 Which stimulus package is that?  Obama's package gave breaks to people making less than $190k/year. He reduced oil subsidies & depreciation value of jets. It curbed outrageous salaries for TARP businesses, but did help small businesses. In 2013, Obama increased taxes for rich.
4449 2018-04-17 15:37:33 Cutting off oil and petroleum will only hurt us for a little bit. BC are healthier, resilient people. Cut us off and you get nothing from our ports. Fuck you, Notley. What's your plan now? Lmfao! #bcpoli #abpoli #skpoli @JustinTrudeau
4450 2018-04-17 15:37:24 Thanks for the info. You appear to have a solid understanding of oil products. I don't have a science background, but here is what I do know.
-the continued burning of fossil fuels is harming our planet (even oil companies will admit to human impact causing global warming)
4451 2018-04-17 15:37:13 I'd say still go. Don't let tweens ruin your good time. Just don't forget to bring your walker and take your fish oil pills before you go.

Exposed the UN allowing Assad to censor the Syrian aid plan in 2016

4463 2018-04-17 15:36:07 Gosh, what will Alberta do without B.C.'s weed oil. They will probably have to adjust to working, making a living and enjoying a nice glass of Chardonnay. Probably a concept the tree huggers on B.C.'s left coast don't understand
4464 2018-04-17 15:36:04 Is this part of "take the oil"?
4465 2018-04-17 15:35:45 Take a wild guess who is financing this assault on Syria? It's Saudi Arabia, it's there gas and oil pipelines that need to go through Syria in order to compete with Russia's pipeline that's running from Iran into turkey and supplying Europe. It's all about the #Pipeline
4466 2018-04-17 15:35:45 Not much of a Canadian. More the right hand of the oil and gas industry, and those wealthy few that really profit from it.
4467 2018-04-17 15:35:35 I put on this face oil and I feel like it all still there
4468 2018-04-17 15:35:33 But BC is trying to restrict oil flow. Alberta is just trying to help.
4469 2018-04-17 15:35:26 Did you know that you can use Canapure Canola Oil in salad dressings, marinades and sauces.

4474 2018-04-17 15:35:06 Fact is : For once Trump said the truth! It's all for the oil!
4475 2018-04-17 15:35:02 Because we’re too busy grovelling to them for their oil.
Roll on the day when new technology will diminish the need for oil based energy & then we can tell all the oil producers to shove it.

4479 2018-04-17 15:34:31 I live in Tulsa and on the west side of the Arkansas river are oil refineries. The wind blows from the west mostly so, especially in Spring, the entire city smells like rotten eggs and the concrete of a gas station.

4483 2018-04-17 15:33:56 Sorry Graham, but the only word to come to mind when I read your comment is "Dickhead". Oil has it's place in the energy supply chain. It will still be a "thing" in 50 years. If you really want to encourage "green" energy, then push for nuclear powered electricity generation.
4484 2018-04-17 15:33:54 All G35 coupes and most 350z’s consume oil so Nissan/Infiniti had a warranty extension on the issue but it already expired. They initiated the test on my G in the past and apparently it wasn’t consuming enough for them to replace the short block at the time lol

4494 2018-04-17 15:32:10 The oil industry is dirty everywhere it’s produced. Heavy oil is made viscous with diluent, so moves the same through pipe, ultimately. But Canadian crude benefits all Canadians. And it especially benefits Quebec.

4518 2018-04-17 15:29:50 The oil sands are a big part of the Canadian economy. But there must be a balance. Conservatives do not worry about the environment,  money is more important. Environmentalists think we should stop doing everything, have no money to run the economy. There must be a compromise.

4526 2018-04-17 15:28:57 Fair point as ever. Oil price will always dictate whether it's a case of battle for survival in aviation or a chance to make hay. Let's see how the land will lie re Russia-Syria-Iran

4577 2018-04-17 15:25:24 The UN is fucking useless and from the reports from OPCW and others on bombing it is not definitive although majority are linked to WH who are a terrorist group funded by the west

Tbh mate I think you should look at links for the oil pipe line Qatar and SA

Who you gonna believe

4580 2018-04-17 15:25:09 Unfortunately, this was before the cost of oil skyrocketed to $100+ per barrel and so it was felt fossil fuels for power still made more sense, so the company abandoned the effort. Didn't help no-one wanted it in their backyard either, even though it'd be far from towns.

4589 2018-04-17 15:24:34 Joke----hahaha. Woo Putin . Sure thing. Russian Sanctions, Rosneft Oil, Magnitsky Act -Ukraine- That's how you woo Russia. You did that already.
4590 2018-04-17 15:24:34 AB should respect BC, abandon pipeline and demand better deal in confederation. Trudeau gov't has decided to phase out oil and gas so AB needs unique deal: no more contributions to equalization no carbon tax no GST more autonomy on trade, immigration, etc.
4591 2018-04-17 15:24:33 I believe global warming but even if it was a hoax it nevertheless remains true that the oil economy itself is a hoax that was engineered as a strategic counter threat to a more beneficial hemp economy xo

4596 2018-04-17 15:24:11 So ISISrael was behind this all along. Al qaeda a western proxy run by mossad attacks NY to get US troops to invade and destroy the ME to extract oil and build gas lines for the bankers. Zionism is a cancer that infects the US government and its lacky the UK. False flag masters.
4597 2018-04-17 15:24:09 I support the pipeline but not the way it's being handled. Curious why Notley can pass a law restricting movement of gas and oil  to BC but BC cannot have a similar law restricting amount of bitumen.
4598 2018-04-17 15:23:59 Because 1 oil well = $1,000,000,000 (WAUN BILLION DOLLAR) according to the professor. He must have seen the valuation in his dream 
4599 2018-04-17 15:23:52 OMG, y’all still peddling that snake oil? It has been ridiculed by your own CBO!
4600 2018-04-17 15:23:47 Yep, by fracking oil. BTW, you should check how your govt. had helped in topping Brazilian president few years.
4601 2018-04-17 15:23:27 That’s pretty much the point he addressed in the interview - not so much from a point of pride, but that the pipeline will take the oil to other countries.
4602 2018-04-17 15:23:27 I’m bout to have Tunde start massaging my vagina with oil now cause I know I ain’t got no elasticity. Lmao

4604 2018-04-17 15:23:18 No way! It's just a conspiracy created by big oil to keep us tied down to conventional travel.
The truth is out there.
4605 2018-04-17 15:23:14 500gms does not sound much. 19 oil barrels full of Nanene sounds a bit more. First we have - where are the orders? Now that orders are appearing - Why are they not bigger?  Tough crowd to please
4606 2018-04-17 15:23:09 1)"A successful CNY oil contract gives the PBOC (and by extension, the world) the ability to completely neutralize the weaponized USD that has become Washington’s weapon of choice in the ongoing global “currency wars.” In plain English, if CNY is convertible under the contract

4610 2018-04-17 15:22:31 Yes, thanks for including both sides in that piece (sarcasm)...you do know that CAPP is an organization of oil companies, right? Pipelines matter before people, especially Indigenous people.
4611 2018-04-17 15:22:28 We just lost the war.

4614 2018-04-17 15:22:25 Cuts taxes 4 corps & millionaires, families will see an increase.

Keeps breaks for oil/gas/coal but eliminates or reduces them 4 solar/wind.

Reduces deduction 4 local taxes, making it harder to fund fire, school, road services.

4622 2018-04-17 15:21:47 Then why is unemployment at historically low levels for women, African-Americans, and overall? No matter who you are as president, that is something to tip your hat to!
We are now EXPORTING ten million barrels of oil daily due to sanctions being lifted off of energy companies.
4623 2018-04-17 15:21:40 And in the year 2018 we are still moving oil by railway. That's the only reason grain is still being used by the railway we don't have the technology to move it by pipeline yet.
This is not about pipelines but rather Coastal tankers.
4624 2018-04-17 15:21:30 No. They won't learn because they are tools for the Globalist Elite. Their aim is to control the whole world. Syria has its own Central Bank, they don't like that and has enormous oil reserves, which the Israelis have already sold shares to people like Murdoch, Rothchild etc.

4626 2018-04-17 15:21:14 I wonder what would happen if or when nations start using #cryptocurrency when trading with oil instead of dollars. #blockchain #bitcoin

4628 2018-04-17 15:20:45 For the record, the current marine oil spill response model requires the Responsible Party, i.e. the polluter, to organise the response, unless @CoastGuardCAN finds that that Party is unknown, unwilling or unable to mount an effective response, in which case CCG assumes command.

4630 2018-04-17 15:20:27 Hi. I have the same skin type as yours too. Maybe you can try doing double cleansing method using cleansing oil first then wash again using foam wash. Do this daily at least once a day and limit using the scrub to 2-3 times a week only.

4633 2018-04-17 15:19:50 A large amount of sushi and cruciferous vegetables last night for dinner,  paired with an iced coffee with a healthy dose of MCT oil this morning has resulted in what I'd call a poo-pocalypse.

4635 2018-04-17 15:19:41 You don't give up, do you? Everyone knows you are shills for big oil and have no intention of telling the truth, but a slanted pro-fossil fuel pitch. Climate change is real. The Pentagon believes it is a threat to national security.
4636 2018-04-17 15:19:36 I hope it's not lead or oil based paint but wouldn't be surprised.
4637 2018-04-17 15:19:35 I remember when my younger brother annoyed me and I couldn’t hit him, I poured half cup of oil,two spoon of salt and a little saliver to make it . When he was done cooking and about to eat,felt bad and kicked the food, he almost cried (food lover)and reported. I luv u bro

And then we're gonna get you bubbly and clean.

4645 2018-04-17 15:19:04 Thank you SO much BC hippies. I too prefer oil to be shipped via more dangerous rail methods, and gas potentially going up to $2/L, all because you couldn't use your goddamn brains or look into something called "forethought"

4651 2018-04-17 15:18:43 Funny strange how provinces that don't produce oil/gas have cheaper gas prices than AB does.
Something is really skewed here.
4652 2018-04-17 15:18:43 Yeah, cutting off the oil supply to millions of people, that's not cynical at all, no sir, nope.
4653 2018-04-17 15:18:34 (1) @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley NO AND NO I am strongly opposed to all payment to Kinder Morgan and any retaliation on BC. Bullying is NOT to be tolerated, and I always though blackmail was against the law, or is it okay for oil companies and certain governments.

4669 2018-04-17 15:17:39 Hi Andy, the oil inside of the machine would class as an internal part. Only Karcher engineers would hold this information, which is why we would normally need to put you in touch with a repair agent.

4700 2018-04-17 15:15:19 I believe tax should be applied on every individual consumer based on how much of fuel/oil consumed or how much CO2 produced by facility/house/site=calculated by consumed energy 

This will help
-Less usage=Less fuel burning 
-Promote other energy sources(renewable)

4705 2018-04-17 15:15:10 Canada closed it's asbestos mines, we're phasing out coal,  kids don't play with mercury in school anymore, there's no lead in gasoline or paint anymore. Oil sands are a convenient choice. Not a necessity.
4706 2018-04-17 15:15:07 Select premiers would put our country in a recession because they think they are being holier than thou.  Alberta oil is what’s keeping this country above water.

4713 2018-04-17 15:14:45 Andrew doesn't want anyone to think about the debt our oil industry owes to our governments. Otherwise people might start asking for them to share more returns with us.
4714 2018-04-17 15:14:44 "If and when" an earthquake strikes, just as I always say "If and when" an oil spill occurs.
4715 2018-04-17 15:14:43 Major Oil leakage on Ring road infront of JW Marriot not less than 30 cars lost control and crashed. Please avoid this area all together
4716 2018-04-17 15:14:27 Would be a good reason to encourage American oil consumption!
4717 2018-04-17 15:14:12 For starters, unemployment is at historically low numbers. The tax cut would be second. And for third, I would go with lifting regulations on businesses, this way they can actually produce their product efficiently...we are now exporting 10 million barrels of oil daily! #Trump!

4723 2018-04-17 15:13:49 Olive oil, honey and brown sugar is an amazing homemade exfoliant scrub. My skin feels so niceeeee 
4724 2018-04-17 15:13:38 There's no future in bitumen. It has too low of an energy returned on energy invested. 3:1 is too low to run a modern civilization, 9:1 is the minimum and only light sweet crude does that in terms of oil types. We're tumbling down the back slope of Hubbard's Peak #peakoil
4725 2018-04-17 15:13:33 So since I’ve started sporting a beard, I’ve noticed that it is really rough. After doing some reading online, I’ve learned that I need beard oil/tonic. Any recommendations for someone with very sensitive skin?

4729 2018-04-17 15:13:21 To trump's supporters, when your grandkids grow up and they can no longer swim in our lakes because they're polluted, or go to national parks because they're littered with oil rigs, and your granddaughter has to use an inhaler because the air is hard to breathe, YOU are complicit
4730 2018-04-17 15:13:20 AKALA KO BABY OIL HAHAHA
4731 2018-04-17 15:13:19 Blackmailed for what? Not the so called pee tapes. More like the Steele dossier , collision, Rosneft Oil, sanctions, Magnitsky Act and more to come. Who's blackmailing him and why.

4741 2018-04-17 15:12:14 Russia also has an issue with Ukraine because all it’s oil pipeline goes through the Ukraine so that’s why they had the treaty in 1999 backing 26,000 troops in Ukraine. They do play ball sides as do we military complex everywhere.
4742 2018-04-17 15:12:10 Getting a full service real soon. Best oil I can get, new plugs and filters. Remapped petrol turbo problems

4744 2018-04-17 15:11:52 Cleaning up oil spill on wooden from an entire cruet of olive oil (courtesy of the 3yr old)  underneath the dining room table is so much fun said no one ever..
4745 2018-04-17 15:11:41 @AlexanderHandleton @uman I agree. The oil fields in WY and ND always boom before the price of oil...and my goodness is it BOOMING...
4746 2018-04-17 15:11:35 I live on the coast of the Moray Firth. I had the choice of fitting an oil boiler or going renewable. Rightly or wrongly I went for biomass. Here’s why 1) it’s not oil 2) I value trees 3) I only source sustainable suppliers 4) it’s not oil. #Renewables
4747 2018-04-17 15:11:32 When Ottawa designed the #OceansProtectionPlan for BC back in 2016, they basically just through some darts at a board and hoped that one or two elements of the plan might stick. I'm talking specifically in terms of marine oil spill response. A fantastic opportunity was missed!
4748 2018-04-17 15:11:15 หล่อจุง หยักดั๊ยๆ
4749 2018-04-17 15:11:10 Yeah also the oil industry sort of made the whole area a mess I agree. I actually think the political and economical turmoil is very important in the ressurgence of more radical version of any worldview. My view being that injustice breeds revolution.
4750 2018-04-17 15:11:08 BC:
We don't want your stinking dirty AB oil coming to BC either by rail or pipeline. 

AB:
We're going to shut off the flow of oil to BC then.

BC:
We'll SUE you if you shut off the Alberta oil!!!

4754 2018-04-17 15:10:41 Lemon juice 

Before applying lemon juice, add a few water drops on it for the purpose of dilution. This is not only one of the best methods to get bigger lips, but it also helps in removing any kind of dirt, grease or oil present on your lips.
4755 2018-04-17 15:10:40 Which reminds me of a North Sea oil drilling ad from the early 80’s, “Es gibt viel zu tun, packen wir’s an” 

Translates roughly to: “there’s much to do, let’s get to it” 

Petrol companies... always ahead of their time.
4756 2018-04-17 15:10:38 Shut up u think that people who are in office don't do any thing to try to spread their name make more money they all do! Look at Bush with oil! Obama endless speeches books sails now he's a millionaire. The Clintons the most corrupt of them all Clinton foundation books speeches
4757 2018-04-17 15:10:29 Yes we sell our oil to the United states at a discount, and the US sell's it back to us at a premium? Yes we have real genius of who we elect to govern our country.After all,closing down Kinder Morgan,who will pay the bill for their construction of pipe lines all ready done? Us!!

4759 2018-04-17 15:10:20 So what would you have private companies do? BTW, if a ship carrying coal sinks or has an accident, it is not as devastating as if an oil tanker does, which is one of the concerns BC residents have over the pipeline
4760 2018-04-17 15:10:16 And any brand of jojoba oil ?

Aunque particularmente creo q la revolución industrial permitió, mejoro la calidad de vida d la humanidad del siglo 19, el problema es la codicia de los grandes, no permite que desarrollos sustentables, florezcan y desplacen al oil.

4779 2018-04-17 15:07:25 if find it interesting that they are talking #methane, but in every PR publication refer to burning natural gas instead of oil as "emission reduction" ... 

sorry, #shell #BP, it doesn't add up.
4780 2018-04-17 15:07:23 When the Port of Vancouver is transformed into an oil tanker Port, they'll be increasing the amount of takers being loaded from 5 each month to more than 1 each day, almost guaranteeing a Fukushima like waterline incident where loading will be underway when an earthquake strikes.
4781 2018-04-17 15:07:13 Still doesnt change the fact that Talabani clan traitors sold kirkuk for $15m and oil smuggling routes into Iran.

4851 2018-04-17 14:59:08 An Impressive list. Unfortunate the administration clouded these good deeds by arrogantly staking its first media actions on approving the Keystone pipeline (currently leaking oil on public and private lands), and rescinding the Bear Ears Monument in response to mining money.

4859 2018-04-17 14:58:35 For daily sampling, I've never seen any effect from evaporation w/o oil. Bigger effects from evaporation due to the storage vial not being not full. Or waiting years to analyze samples as they sit in a fridge (not me btw).

3. Avoid strong soap; Strong soaps can strip oil from your skin, instead choose mild ones.

4910 2018-04-17 14:53:03 Saskatchewan has waded in on Alberta's side and are tabling legislation to block oil to BC as well, meanwhile Quebec has jumped in on BC's side.  There are 44 days left till deadline, I'm sure we can get Newfoundland and the Ontario candidates to dip some toes by then.

i tried them and man now i know why...
the actual powder really controls oil that i have less touch ups despite scorching heat here in ph
but its a lil expensive i guess but its worth it
its 115 pesos in watsons :)

4920 2018-04-17 14:52:06 Do you use mineral oil for daily sampling? My impression is that evaporation isn't as much of a concern for these, particularly in humid places with big rain events. Different for monthly collection though.
4921 2018-04-17 14:52:03 It was clearly a well crafted strategy to contain and control Alberta Oil, which will benefit everybody except for Canadians.

4927 2018-04-17 14:51:15 No irony there... the environmental crusaders aka. the bc government, who’s currently wanting to get away from the fossil fuels, and blocking the flow of oil, is going to sue over restrictions placed on the amount of oil coming into their province. Careful what you wished for.

4934 2018-04-17 14:50:00 I'm fully aware of what it is.  I see you watch MSM and buy into their narrative.  I have no time to waste with people that aren't open to receiving possibilities.  All wars are for profit, ammunition, oil, diamonds, poppy fields and the almighty petrodollar.  Research!

4968 2018-04-17 14:46:23 6) My guess if you force the pipeline onto regions that are so polarized and divided, so no party could actually win an election, you are going to see lots of resistance, and that in itself could cause oil spills. If I was Kinder Morgan I would be avoiding such an opportunity.

We have the technology right now to turn all of this around, we can heal this planet and us.

4990 2018-04-17 14:43:11 Stunning to me that so-called "social-justice-warrior types, even, will argue that bombing Syria's justified bc chemical weapons, but other kinds of slaughter, i.e. barrel bombs, Hellfire missiles, starvation are acceptable. Esp. if not in a country w/oil or strategic importance.
4991 2018-04-17 14:43:08 Hi Damarcia
I'd recommend Rosy Cheeks face mask! It contains Kaolin which absorbs excess oil, Rose Oil which has balancing properties and Calamine Powder to calm the skin. Follow with hydrating Vanishing Cream moisturiser! ~ Sam

That kept them off the muslim ban and now they've cut back oil production and gas is going higher. Trump is so easy
5042 2018-04-17 14:36:59 If 71% of a 42 gal barrel of oil goes to transportation fuel, assuming 36% is for personal vehicles, that would leave more oil from Macadam production.

5061 2018-04-17 14:34:34 .@albertaNDP says they can’t afford to not build the Trans Mountain pipeline and get their oil to market through BC. In order to drive that point home, they want to stop oil from getting to market in BC. Isn’t that the opposite of what they want!?
#bcpoli #pipeline #hypocrisy
5062 2018-04-17 14:34:25 Thanks. Very clear trends: oil, despite its dominance in transportation, is losing market share. Coal dropping faster. Hydro, nuke stable.  Renewables slow growing, but now a factor.

5081 2018-04-17 14:31:47 Krugman’s playing fast and loose with the facts: he claims that energy sector donations go mainly to Repubs - but the fact is, Hillary received more oil money than Trump in 2016.
5082 2018-04-17 14:31:05 What a load of crap. This brazen attempt you refer to was to make our land safer from the corporate evils of the oil industry

5120 2018-04-17 14:26:20 why do all the trolls hide behind a dumb handle?you have no way of knowing what i rely on. would guess you are middle aged and contributed to our current environmental situation.Its time for people like you to give up stop making excuses for big oil.

5121 2018-04-17 14:26:17 Start branding it Hindu- Muslim and put oil on fire because this is what u journalists related to ABP and NDTV have been doing these days. We r ashamed of these happenings but stop encashing these mishappenings.

5129 2018-04-17 14:25:19 Actually I'm cutting the grass  oil leaks I will leave to others  great afternoon on here forgot I was working at times  
5130 2018-04-17 14:25:14 Why can one province restrict oil leaving  and the other can’t restrict oil coming in.
5131 2018-04-17 14:25:00 While #OccupiedIran is ruling by mullahs and they have access to #Oil and #Money their expansion and ambition won't be limited. If you seek real peace and stability in the middle east you have to stand with #Iranians on thier struggle for #Freedom #Democracy
5132 2018-04-17 14:24:58 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine
5133 2018-04-17 14:24:54 I do not believe he is incompetent. Maybe he just has different goals than you think. Maybe all he cares about is propping up the prices of oil, and aluminum, and pumping money into the military-industrial complex. And here you are thinking he actually cares.
5134 2018-04-17 14:24:46 A man knows who his heart truly belongs to. So you can cook his food in diamond oil & do backflips on his dick, but if it’s not you, it’s not you boo. Stay wise to vibes.#realtalk #staywoke #itsnotyou
5135 2018-04-17 14:24:45 He gets paid, has gotten paid for work in the area of geology, which he has a degree in.  Oil, gas, and minerals are purview of the field of geology.

5139 2018-04-17 14:24:22 @Dave_Eby so you want to sue Alberta for stopping the shipments of oil and gas because it punishes your province so what do you think you are doing to Alberta by restricting the shipping of bitumen to world markets we do not have to sell you one ounce of oil

5141 2018-04-17 14:23:55 Gail, you make your points so well! Amazing how so many idiots think Reagan fought deficits!

He tripled national debt (in real $) during his 8 years, illegally sold weapons to Iran, & greatly increased oil imports. 4 Americans died in Benghazi; 241 in Beirut Marine barracks!

5144 2018-04-17 14:23:34 2) Add to that, about 1/3 of Canadians now work in precarious employment situations. It's not that oil and gas earnings are so good, it's that most people have slid down the earnings ladder.

5153 2018-04-17 14:22:19 I wouldnt say it’s flat but theres definitely top level shit going on in the Artic. Only scientists can go to certain parts on the edges; nothing over the middle. And no country can make claims to it or shits ton of oil and resources. Not mention the place is classified a desert.
5154 2018-04-17 14:22:16 It’s oil spill weekend and my nerves are bad because I can’t go this year. That’s my favorite party 
5155 2018-04-17 14:22:06 Let's hope it is quickly accompanied by a quick and expected fall. I can't see the idiots being able to pump this too high. Unless you are something else. The grey or blue vulture is near :)

5162 2018-04-17 14:21:11 The MSM also never talks about the Kurds holding Syrians northern well fields.  Nor Israel hold their southern oil fields and giving out contracts to companies to drill the oil.  The real reason we protect the Kurds is to keep the oil away from Assad so he can't rebuild.

5171 2018-04-17 14:19:31 I stopped using that bullshit and started using just soap and water and moisturizing with jojoba oil and my face literally cleared up within a week and half. It’s been flawless ever since
5172 2018-04-17 14:19:26 You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I’ll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
‘Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

5181 2018-04-17 14:18:37 N1.4 trillion spent annually on oil subsidy, yet the pump price of PMS remains at N145, while GEJ spent half of same amount and maintained the price at N87. What an irony!

5184 2018-04-17 14:18:19 I would also put in a nod to cutting the sprouts in half, tossing them with minced preserved lemon and olive oil, and then roasting them at high heat until they're crispy in bits. Maybe dust with parmesan at the very end.

5263 2018-04-17 14:09:49 aww but the "data is like crude oil" analogy works so well. Extraction, contaminants, quality, refinement, spills, externalities...

5266 2018-04-17 14:09:36 With lithium batteries, harvested in mines that used diesel equipment. And parts that were made, delivered and shipped using gasoline, diesel or other oil based products. Let's start measuring and charging for upstream and downstream emissions!! #cdnpoli #abpoli #bcpoli
5267 2018-04-17 14:09:24 Thanks everyone. Think I'll try the mineral oil in a trap to start with as this is effectively retrofit now and have a look at the rest for the upcoming project. Living and learning! :) That CIBSE detail would be fabulous if you can find it @SallyGodber
5268 2018-04-17 14:09:23 King David teaches us that when it's YOURS, it doesn't matter who submitted the application first, who applied first, who saw it first, who called first, or who got there first! The oil can’t flow until you get there! What God has for you, is for you!
5269 2018-04-17 14:09:21 Things Trinidad need to ban!
1. Circuses and Zoos.
2. Oil/Gas for Electricity (non-renewable's). Should be full solar/wind.
3. Potholes since you know...
we have a Pitch Lake.
4. All Styrofoam and Plastic...
5. Bad driving with compelling video evidence...
5270 2018-04-17 14:09:21 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
5271 2018-04-17 14:09:09 I'm not sure. When we were in NYC last November, we had it as it was so much better.
Whether it's the chicken itself, or butter cream or the oil it's cooked in. It just tasted much juicer and full of flavour
KFC is a bit bland

5278 2018-04-17 14:08:13 Thanks 4 this. The concept is good, but change needs to come from all quarters, including clients. If I don't change the oil in my car for 4 years, the mechanic won't give me a new engine for the price of the oil changes I missed.
5279 2018-04-17 14:08:00 Does that mean Spark is the new oil well? Oil drill? Fracker?

5287 2018-04-17 14:07:01 This is funny. They waited for countries like America to build oil plants there and then confiscated them and threw them out..I guess they had to break them down and sell them for parts?

5291 2018-04-17 14:06:28 Many people touting the virtues of our Federal Liberals say our economy grew faster than any other in the G7. So really we performed the best of 7 poorly growing economies. If we look at China it grew at 6.8% last 2 Qtrs but we can't get our oil to them.
5292 2018-04-17 14:06:27 US won't say a word about Yemen. 
Worse ongoing humanitarian crisis in the World right now. 
I researched this and posted on my Facebook Page. Yemen is a Hillary & Obama War- Obama w/drones and Soros involved & Saudi Arabia. S.A. wants Yemen for a corridor for gas and oil.
5293 2018-04-17 14:06:21 Indian Rupee ended sharply weaker today after slipping to near 7-month low due to constant dollar buys by foreign banks noting arbitrage in NDF market.

5332 2018-04-17 14:02:26 friends don't let friends use the "data is the new oil" line
5333 2018-04-17 14:02:25 We are saying the same thing. When oil was selling at $100/barrel, what did the govt do? Did they reinvest those proceeds? NO! Did the govt at the time and now put infrastructure (refineries, educational, health, agriculture) in place that will ease the pressure on USD? NO!
5334 2018-04-17 14:02:25 If oil and gas is in decline as we transition to renewables; I mourn the loss of geological knowledge.

5340 2018-04-17 14:01:21 They have passed small bills here and there that raise cost of living for poor.

Our bit of world must change now. Yesterday. Tomorrow is too late already!
5366 2018-04-17 13:57:50 Walk around some of these consulting firms and banks in Nbi such as Mckinsey, PwC, Citi and Morgan Stanley and you will find young Kenyans burning the midnight oil out there and enjoying it. Those guys will be the future corporate titans.....

5370 2018-04-17 13:57:17 That story again, Shell won't be competitive or resilient after 2030. Apparently that's when the oil runs out and the new dark age begins.
Or it's just bad copy...but I'm building a bunker anyways.

thieves they are !!
5373 2018-04-17 13:56:27 Yes I do based on the revenue from production and the value in a sale, the positive is the oil & gas sector is hotting up but at £25-30m they should see a further sharp decline 

Sources suggest the stock was taken up to allow city out #AST

5385 2018-04-17 13:54:39 Trudeau and McKenna talk a good game on taxing Canadians but fail miserably at getting our resources to market. Is it true France's Total SA oil company pulled out of the Alberta oilsands and went to Iran?  #cdnpoli

5387 2018-04-17 13:54:35 I’ve been directly attacked for this even before I arrived here

The only benefit to solar now is to the companies leasing the panels to you 

Some exceptions but the entire model was based on .50/kWh prices due to $200 oil

Solar panel=hazardous heavy metal waste

5388 2018-04-17 13:54:33 amazingly, he really does seem to mean by "geologist" "person who promotes oil company interests," which seems like a bit of throwaway dialogue for a cartoon villain.
5389 2018-04-17 13:54:23 I mean, he’s already had me mad but no self respecting geologist would do what he’s doing to the earth and specifically national parks and I literally work for the oil industry

5400 2018-04-17 13:53:16 Everyone is not seeing the benefits from or talking about the tax cuts. Many are worried about the deficit, the growing income and wealth inequity, and the looming cuts to Medicare and Social Security that are likely. You are selling snake oil.

5423 2018-04-17 13:50:49 Try baking soda and dish soap. It works on oil stains so I’m sure it’ll work on toothpaste! 

Get the spot wet, put a few drops of soap and some baking soda and rub it in. Let it sit for a minute or two then just throw it in the wash.

So truth I would like it to go back to where it was!!

Get the spot wet, put a dot or two of soap, a bit of baking soda and rub it in. Don’t rinse it off, just throw it in the wash.

5526 2018-04-17 13:37:57 Only if we control oil and money
5527 2018-04-17 13:37:41 Liberal Organizations claiming Trump trade equalization with nations as China, will increase product cost by 23%, forget Carter allowed the oil it’s all made from to rise 600%. America will ultimately benefit through manufacturing & jobs.
5528 2018-04-17 13:37:35 I will have to look for it. I was just thinking of how FARC surrendered their ongoing civil war with the Colombian Government last year. That the groups are fighting now sounds like Legitimate Business men have violent discussions over ownership of olive oil trade. 
5529 2018-04-17 13:37:33 When are we going to save the honor of international community by stopping the GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa for oil by British govt and their jihadists?. REFERENDUM.

He is strictly a corporatist who filled cabinet with lobbyist & billionaires to destry govt, H20, air!

5552 2018-04-17 13:35:00 I enjoy reading about the monumental mess.the UK was in before it got baled out by Europe and North Sea Oil revenues.What will they do now?
5553 2018-04-17 13:35:00 The officials at the Energy ministry are some of the most corrupt people. I will send you a link to an article am finalizing on the state of Kenyan oil. Did you know there are some barrels that have been transported to the Mombasa refinary. Yet the country knows nothing.
5554 2018-04-17 13:34:54 When Edm won McDavid,Don Cherry said if the Oil didn’t address their defence they were still in trouble.PC addressed the defence&it still needs more.Draft best players available then trade for need,PC has the guts to do what it takes despite the costs,just like the Hall trade
5555 2018-04-17 13:34:22 now if MILK wants to make some pretty CBD oil lip stains then they can take my $$
5556 2018-04-17 13:34:17 Scenario 2 ippc lands we get taken over. Scenario 3 ippc lands and we partner with additional people. I could go on and on .... we are profitable and there are deeper zones and oil potential which pick a scenario  #ast
5557 2018-04-17 13:34:11 I think the majority want the pipeline. It's only the vocal minority made up of environmental supporters that get the headlines. How else can we move oil? Let's have a public vote  to see where people stand.

Arar, gastar gas oil, usar herbicidas muy residuales, dejar de sembrar algunos campos inferiores, erosionar los mejores campos y los medios

5567 2018-04-17 13:32:51 We don’t need the current level of environmentals whose agenda is vague. If we leave it to Elizabeth May no one would work in oil industry.
5568 2018-04-17 13:32:46 Find the glitter! I got a bottle I can put almond oil in to mix it with.

5570 2018-04-17 13:32:32 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
5571 2018-04-17 13:32:31 Rather depends what the gene sequence for the enzyme gets spliced into. I'm sure there are extremophiles in the oil already. This could beef them up...
5572 2018-04-17 13:32:30 I guess we'll see if she turns off the oil to BC, which she won't.

5591 2018-04-17 13:30:33 Nice to see #alberta is moving towards a socialist state by controlling resources. I guess the free enterprise oil companies are okay with this.
5592 2018-04-17 13:30:23 ……まっまに勧められたギャルゲもついでって言って買いたい
5593 2018-04-17 13:30:16 It’s obvious to anyone that isn’t hooked in the nose like most socialists.  Destroy Alberta’s oil industry and then when it’s in ashes...nationalize it.  Drama reacher just finishing his fascist father’s dream.  If you can’t see that, you must be part of the socialist party.
5594 2018-04-17 13:30:12 Better example then: Why is there no fight about equalizing gender representation among garbage workers or oil rig workers?
5595 2018-04-17 13:30:10 That's only true nominally. On a real basis, quick search shows min wage peak in 1968 @ $8.54. & I don't think the pt here is that mkts for labor and oil are identical but that both fluctuate, and co's are far more averse to responding to fluctuations in the frmr than the latter

5603 2018-04-17 13:29:14 I don't believe they are anymore an eye sore than a cell tower, radio tower and an oil rig. So yeah I'd rather have windmills and they won't post a risk to our beaches and water.

5610 2018-04-17 13:28:11 He’s an oil and gas guy. A Cattleman’s boy as well. Now that’s not bad mind you. But just to lie. Well, now that’s the issue. He’s a fraud. Like the #potus. That’s not #American. That’s not like most #Montanans. And it breaks my head to see our state represented by #Zinke

5612 2018-04-17 13:28:05 There is a ton of research on "non-photorealistic rendering" that's all about making things look like oil/charcoal etc dynamically

5625 2018-04-17 13:27:02 Actually businesses are calling it as edible coconut oil and selling it as hair oil for decades coz tax is lower.

5627 2018-04-17 13:26:59 I'll have to see - I have a moringa, jojoba, rosehip oil that is pretty light as well as my Mad Hippie Antioxidant oil. My Derma-E Radiant and Kiehl's Overnight oils are heavier and I use them at night. I use lighter oils in the AM b/c there are also oils in my sunscreen.
5628 2018-04-17 13:26:58 Beard smell like coconut oil
5629 2018-04-17 13:26:57 Given the one that eats oil also uses so much oxygen that nearby fish drown, I really hope this is not just released into the environment. It's our job to recollect all the plastic
5630 2018-04-17 13:26:55 We will see how much @JeepCares actually cares today. Dropped off ‘14 Grand Cherokee for a known part failure that causes oil leaks. Anxious to see if they pass the blame or take ownership in their quality. Possible 1 time Jeep owner.

5634 2018-04-17 13:26:30 I always use coconut oil to cook. Much healthier.
5635 2018-04-17 13:26:25 As soon as they find some oil there we will be there with bells on.

5639 2018-04-17 13:26:12 Dear all understand that being an entrepreneur in Nigeria is extremely hard.

5641 2018-04-17 13:26:03 Once they were desert wolves. Relying on the hardship & daunting task. Still they were happy. Sudden oil discovery was a great test for them. The Economic prosperity was misinterpreted & wrongly implemented just to save kingship. Now these liberty will create chaos only.
5642 2018-04-17 13:25:52 Gee, I wonder how much of that tourism business is made possible because of oil?

5646 2018-04-17 13:25:15 Don’t think so, if he was in the globalist’s club they wouldn’t want him removed so that they can put the 2 strategic oil pipelines through Syria. In that club there’d be no false flag wars as they’d be working together

5659 2018-04-17 13:22:51 With oil & gas dev in NGR, I'm glad oil block license renewal will not be automatic anymore. So many companies have not been paying right taxes, royalties etc to the govt yet still want renewal. Now all of them will be rushing to pay what they're supposed to pay.

5664 2018-04-17 13:22:06 This is just in regards to opperations and it has nothing to do with the oil/gas that they sell. Thereforeit reflects significantly less than 1% of their emissions.

5676 2018-04-17 13:20:39 Good piece, and an important counter to those who claim oil and gas are sunset industries Canada should abandon sooner rather than later. I'm concerned about climate change, but economic suicide doesn't seem like much of a mitigation strategy.

5682 2018-04-17 13:20:11 A Reuters’ poll found that US crude oil stocks likely decreased by 1.90 mmbbl, following an increase week before. The decrease, if confirmed might reverse the upward trend in the crude inventories started in mid-January.
5683 2018-04-17 13:20:09 It’s not emotional— it’s different.  If I buy oil at $60 today, that doesn’t mean I have to $60 forever.  With labor, that’s exactly what it means — it elevates the baseline cost forever.   It’s fundamentally different.
5684 2018-04-17 13:19:37 @SarahChampionMP What do SYRIA, IRAQ and LYBIA have in common, besides oil?  Answer- They all refused a Rothschild bank. Now was that hard?

5686 2018-04-17 13:19:34 It's about ok.  Middle East equals oil.  It's a valuable piece of real estate.  A reward for becoming the world power after ww2.  Israel is there just as a client state to watch over.  Dictators on our side ate good.  The ones not on our side are evil.  Unless your religious.

5703 2018-04-17 13:16:30 It illustrates how compromised the Liberal party is to oil&gas interests. Makes no sense to be reducing demand (yay) while increasing supply. The primary beneficiary is oil&gas industry, not Cdn society at large.

5736 2018-04-17 13:13:55 I enjoy how BC is forgetting how they are already receiving their oil products through a pipeline AND train - one of the riskiest ways to transport oil.  #smh #cantseetheforestforthetrees

5741 2018-04-17 13:13:34 This whole thing is about Iraq. They need oil prices to rise before they turn their currency back on so they can have more money in the coffers.

Also, not well known, some notably Canadian oil companies, such as Suncor, Canadian Oil Sands and Husky, are predominantly owned by non-Canadians
5797 2018-04-17 13:09:14 Ah ok--so you mean the GCC followers you speak of perhaps don't realise they are out of step not only with the actual current oil price but with the changing GCC mentality
5798 2018-04-17 13:09:12 2/2 In terms of “warming up the planet”, the growth of global oil consumption *in 2017 alone* was roughly equivalent to Canada’s *entire* consumption. If we shut down the entire country and all move into caves, any difference to global warming would be inconsequential.

5801 2018-04-17 13:08:51 We make cluster bombs to sell to other countries because it is illegal to make them anywhere else. A war crime.

So many were used in 2015 (Or 2016 ), that we ran out.

Why because we want oil?
5802 2018-04-17 13:08:48 That is a stark contrast to my visit there 20yrs ago when there was very little expensive US bottled water, salt came in non-descript plastic bags and there was no olive oil. There was a frightfully spicy sauce which I excessed with on rice…

More than 2/3's of all oil sands production in Canada is owned by foreign entities, sending a majority of the industry’s profits out of the country. They want us to trade-off our environmental rights, as Canadians, for increased pipeline'd profits.

5932 2018-04-17 12:55:50 I am in the carribean, on an island full of sugar cane. The hotel serves italian bottled water, sea salt from france, pepper bottled in france, jam from england, sugar packaged in NYC. Nonsensical. The only thing that is legitimately imported is olive oil (cant grow olives here).
5933 2018-04-17 12:55:48 A another little piece from macrone report for you no voters,     In 1974, McCrone wrote a now-famous report for ministers predicting Scotland would become "as rich as Switzerland" if it controlled North Sea oil - a prediction that was kept from voters. Read the report still no ?
5934 2018-04-17 12:55:33 But oil pumps don’t? Wind turbines are an elegant solution compared to these.

5945 2018-04-17 12:54:32 So with Bill 12 Alberta can turn off the flow of oil to BC. But didn't they JUST want a pipeline?? Now I'm confused...

これが O il → oil → oui と変化して、現代フランス語に残っているんだな。

5980 2018-04-17 12:50:27 Recent data "suggest". Long term data paint a different picture, but labour force decline, which produces labour scarcity, is recent. Also, the oil patch not doing well and NB economy got a temporary boost lately. This helps interprov migration balance.

6012 2018-04-17 12:46:40 I think Trump was slated to get a cut of Rosneft if he lifted sanctions and  the arctic oil drilling deal went through. 
I don't think the American people - even many Trumpers - would accept being sold out. And evidence of this would probably be outright treason.
6013 2018-04-17 12:46:35 Something has bothered me about pipelines for years. After the Exon Valdez spill, it became standard for oil tankers to have double hulls. Why can't we do that with pipelines? You could have spill sensors in the outer hull.

6064 2018-04-17 12:40:51 How about a solution, a grain or a coal pipeline (or conveyor belt).  That will "free up" track space for the oil then.  Does that sound better?

6073 2018-04-17 12:40:13 Audit the Fed . That will stop interest rates . The only reason the US did not tank was because we can print money . China openly calls to be the worlds currency. They have gold backing we have oil . People have no clue what it means if we lose world currency status
6074 2018-04-17 12:40:13 Diluted bitumen is 10X the volume of refined product & much greater environmental risk. Just imagine... jobs to build, run & maintain refineries... domestic product instead of Saudi oil... less risky pipelines that can actually secure legal AND social licence...

6097 2018-04-17 12:37:03 Sure, but we only offer good clean drugs as a harm reduction effort, not an economic necessity. Reducing oil supply drives up prices which reduces unnecessary use. Now is not the time to race to flood the market. The same investment in alternatives provides...alternatives! ;)

6236 2018-04-17 12:17:49 There’s a book that should be written based on that last sentence.

Exploitation isn’t uniquely American but it has always been our way. THAT has to change. Renewable energy is great way to start that change. 

Coal & oil are the finite byproduct of planetary extinction events.

6304 2018-04-17 12:09:10 Also, I’m a broken record player w this point but why is the deployment of the US military to secure supply never factored into cost comparisons?

6339 2018-04-17 12:04:10 @Ventura_PD Why do we need oil when we have free energy? I have the patents. See now why Ventura County hates me?
6340 2018-04-17 12:03:58 Time to get an oil change and tires rotated before leaving for NIH. I remember last time the oil light came on that Friday before we were about to leave too lol
6341 2018-04-17 12:03:54 From a movie trailer:

Choosing a girlfriend is a lot like buying a used car.  If the oil doesn't smell right there's probably something wrong with the vehicle.

6357 2018-04-17 12:01:58 Rupee closes at 65.65, six-month low. Rising US yield, oil price hike, FII net outflow, rising trade deficit and corporate import covering and most importatly banning of LoU by RBI -- all played a part @ETFinance @ETForex #forex

6360 2018-04-17 12:01:04 hold on....you are saying just the act of moving 5% of the world's oil causes 2.2% of world CO2 emissions??  and what other unrefined things does it put in the air when you include the emissions to make the boats in the first place?
6361 2018-04-17 12:00:59 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. (1 Samuel 16:13 NKJV). He will favor you in the midst of opposition. Be Encouraged (Romans 8:28)

6362 2018-04-17 12:00:49 Making solid S. batteries with good features and low price would be equivalent of having Saudi oil fields.  Samsung and other companies spending billions on it.

6365 2018-04-17 12:00:38 The UAE has run of oil and now operates on smoke and mirrors. The current State is in debt to the tune of $120bn and like all good debtors borrows from Peter to pay Paul and then adds the interest due to the debt.
6366 2018-04-17 12:00:38 2/n Countries like Denmark don't really have much of natural minerals like Oil in Norway or big forests of Sweden & Finland but it had strong winds & now Denmark is world leader in wind energy. Why? Bcz govt invested in people & supported them

6381 2018-04-17 11:59:21 #ASt the funds needed to develop this field, which is undervalued ten times at current SP, is peanuts to a big oil&gas company! they will be interested in the long term asset which will produce and be profitable for many years
6382 2018-04-17 11:59:16 Rikki Hall's 'Booze and Baccy" beard oil. It smells quite nice and keeps the facial hair nice and soft. Or even Old Joll's Mandarin and Ceaderwood.
6383 2018-04-17 11:59:02 And those other oil producing countries are paying activists to block OUR product from getting to tidewater
6384 2018-04-17 11:58:52 the oil money has greased palms to turn a blind eye ...again

6397 2018-04-17 11:57:18 POMPEO'S CHRISTIANITY

Kill Muslims while stealing their oil.

Bombs trump words.

Lie about every subject while sending soldiers and civilians to their death.

False flag attacks to induce war.

Publicly pray to Jesus.

A throwback to the Western Crusaders.
6398 2018-04-17 11:57:09 Should we take men from the oil industry, road building, keeping forests, engineering in general, or what?

6403 2018-04-17 11:56:27 Good article: Oil delivery contracts cannot be disrupted. Any sustained embargo will cause a 50 car pile-up in the #Alberta economy.
Pity poor-oil rich Alberta suffering from a massive gov't debt & nothing close to a Norwegian style sovereign wealth fund

6405 2018-04-17 11:55:52 Brilliant work, Alexandra. And now there is an increasing number of top oil engineers working in...Russia of all places. Amazing how a bunch of military and other Chavistas who claim to defend the "Motherland" have screwed it up so much.

6419 2018-04-17 11:53:00 You have to soak the fries in water for 10 to 30 minutes to remove the nasty starch on the outside to make the oven do its job. The oil does that automatically and that's why it tastes better without any setup. Trust me, I used to hate baking fries.
6420 2018-04-17 11:52:53 People are dumber for listening to this snake oil salesman.

6479 2018-04-17 11:44:52 the govt should pull out of opec now and increase export in crude oil afterall, oil price will not go beyond $70/barrel the next decade.
6480 2018-04-17 11:44:49 One of these days, you're gonna drink like motor oil or something 
6481 2018-04-17 11:44:48 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
6482 2018-04-17 11:44:38 @KrissyCela saw your insta post, I suggest to use "Multani Clay+water" paste with a drop of "Eucalyptus Oil" daily on face for a week, wash after dry & acne will reduce by huge. I used it & it is great.
It's a Ayurvedic wayout and have no harmuful side effects #lovefromIndia
6483 2018-04-17 11:44:34 I’ve had a rental booked for over a month while my car gets fixed and when I came to pick it up I have to wait so they can take it to get an oil change....... annoying
6484 2018-04-17 11:44:29 I'm getting an oil change before I go to work. I wanted that two hours of sleep...

6486 2018-04-17 11:44:12 But I still believe that Norway is one of the best countries to live in. We are well provided for by the security of our oil fund, but Norwegians are also hard working people, and one of the most efficient in work aspect.
6487 2018-04-17 11:43:54 Have they band  all gas and oil products in B.C. , bad carbon footprint
6488 2018-04-17 11:43:47 Jason and The Argan Oil will be using it alongside the Jungle conditioner bar, which I have been loving for 8 months!

6494 2018-04-17 11:43:01 Why are they not yet charged? Oil & Gas ?
6495 2018-04-17 11:42:44 Africa now has a world class plant that burns waste and can also create a synthetic oil for fuel all whilst maintaining high omissions standards in an effort to tackle recyclable waste. Here Politicians can only blame China. Reality is we are 20 years behind in this field

6500 2018-04-17 11:41:54 Oh they care so much. Look at how they are oiling corruption. This is beyond them not replying but cooking to legalize a scum that will see we citizens pay for tokens via  contracted companies Dynamo Ltd and Vendit Ltd that will cost us extra money to oil private pockets.
6501 2018-04-17 11:41:34 Took me 4 hours to paint a portrait. First time to use acrylic and oil paint ahuhuhu

6503 2018-04-17 11:41:24 Nope. Oil is still so cheap that recycling isn’t profitable. That’s so messed up.
6504 2018-04-17 11:41:18 I don't know about vitamins but have you tried a lavender oil or a snake plant?
6505 2018-04-17 11:41:07 What has that got to do with scots having the same amount of oil?

6507 2018-04-17 11:40:49 We all need to change behaviours, there's more my family can do, we are pretty frugal, spouse uses bike for work, and we work on growing food, buying local.  Km wont stop oil sands, kxl and kochs benefit, oil will move by rail as demand drives market and biz case

6522 2018-04-17 11:39:29 Perhaps Russia would prefer big oil at small price $39bbl? They must take wood, enjoy it and say thank you

6526 2018-04-17 11:38:58 Maybe the G7 Leaders should risk their own lives to protect things like Rupert Murdoch's oil interests in the Golan Heights and leave the people out of it. Because this is what it's really about, isn't it. It's not about chemical weapons or children.

6531 2018-04-17 11:37:47 Km adds 1 tanker per day if approved, if not washington state would continue monopoly still sending own frieghters, oil would still transport by more dangerous rail, holding up grain exports, many products made from petro, want to stop KM, kill market for it,  demand drives it

6574 2018-04-17 11:29:08 BC is out of control.  We have more oil in this Country than what we know what to do with it.  All oil imports should be taxed to the equivalent of our own oil.  We are going to need leadership on this file from the next Government.  Should it be a National energy policy?

6577 2018-04-17 11:28:56 well no, saudi arabia sells the oil mostly to the US, avoiding parts of the trip makes it cheaper.. and even better if a move would lower the risk of the boats being sinked

6581 2018-04-17 11:28:43 Despite USA producing cheaper-priced 10 M barrels of oil/day, we’re still import higher-priced 7.5 M barrels of oil/day.

Many of energy producers in USA (including green energy) are foreign-owned—as are refiners, oil-byproduct manufacturers, ports & tankers.

6589 2018-04-17 11:27:36 The oil, tech, construction and transport sector. The right business can also earn you that much.
6590 2018-04-17 11:27:28 Interesting but we guess that the plan was more to directly convey the oil through a pipeline from Hadramawt yemeni province to Saudia Arabia, no?
6591 2018-04-17 11:27:28 Listen, oil & gas, Telecoms and multinationals like Dangote groups are paying this much but the chunk goes to foreign nationals.
6592 2018-04-17 11:27:23 Am i the only one who thinks ren is not going to cook? and the text is saying about turning forest diffuser into a reality...

For some reason i interpret is as making a DIY diffuser for beauty?  Like essential oil diffuser with forest theme or something
6593 2018-04-17 11:27:14 Oil it's sooo nice and you see a difference within days! And it also improves the texture of your skin I love it.
6594 2018-04-17 11:26:41 Don't need to be an oil maestro to understand #PMG. At the time of the tip cash covered most of its market cap, with extra cash equivalents in Faroe stock, and a lot of licenses with increasing activity. Many of us knew it was a bargain share before ST pumped it.
6595 2018-04-17 11:26:38 We believe this oil is remnants of that which collected in low flow areas and between boats during the worst of the spill in March. With boats now moving again, this frees up the oil, and Old Ford and Clapton are natural gathering points for it because of the flow of the river.
6596 2018-04-17 11:26:35 i 100% recommend coconut oil/products on ur hair i bleached my hair three times but it doesn't look like dead grass thx to all that
6597 2018-04-17 11:26:19 Many thanks young sir... the Beard oil these people have is class. Not to heavy duty and a little of their balm goes a long way. Beard is in good order, face doesn’t itch and I smell better than normal  Give them a whirl.
6598 2018-04-17 11:26:10 LOL,,,try looking at Norway,,same oil barrel count as scotland yet one of the worlds richest countries
The UK had more oil than Abu Dhabi and Dubai combined Stephen,,have you seen pics of Dubai?

6603 2018-04-17 11:25:43 And with that, BC’s government has become the equivalent of the cat that meows to be let outside, only to immediately stare at the door to be let back in once it leaves the house.  Trying to stop oil shipments at all costs and then complaining when Alberta decides not to ship it.
6604 2018-04-17 11:25:39 We dont need that line we have so much oil and we are moving away from it a lot. I mean we will use it in otherways. But not in cars much longer.

6613 2018-04-17 11:24:48 It's okay. My body is developing crude oil as a renewable resource, I am the key to rectifying the energy crisis, we'll milk it daily and once we're totally dependent upon solar energy I can van gogh this sucker... I have another ear anyway, NBD

6657 2018-04-17 11:18:58 A lot of nations have done wonders with just oil and gas. (Dubai, Kuwait etc). The problem is that Nigerians are not serious. The only OPEC member that imports petroleum products. It's a shame.

Indicting Abacha would have been equal to indicting himself.
6663 2018-04-17 11:18:11 Actually it is not, she is making a good point.  If you are so against oil, why continue to support those items that relie on it?

6702 2018-04-17 11:11:59 Euro zone needs to import about 10 million barrels oil per day. Prices go up a little, like from 30 to 60 dollars and the oil deficit reaches about 100 billion dollars. Economist oftenly think that energy supply is fixed by supply/demand market. It doesn't

6722 2018-04-17 11:08:59 Everyone WITH a brain sees that carbon pricing ONLY POTENTIALLY benefits the environment when the major contributors participate.

Currently none of the major GHG producing countries, nor the oil producing ones, for that matter are participating.

6727 2018-04-17 11:08:24 The modern one would be able to use almost anywhere. Certainly, in the future, more food courts & restaurants would be coming at higher floors. MWSC should be making the public aware about modern oil traps.
6728 2018-04-17 11:08:18 @CoriumSkincare Quick question. Corium does not have a moisturiser in the skin care range. Is it advisable to apply oils directly onto ones skin after cleansing and toning- ie the Tea tree oil? A product I've been using and been discontinued.

6730 2018-04-17 11:08:09 Trudeau is well aware we need pipelines to be able to divest away from US interests who are lobbying and sending paid activists into CDA to disrupt projects to keep the oil flowing into US at a 40% discount and then sell it back refined to CDA at world prices, and JT duz nothing?

6904 2018-04-17 10:36:44 I agree with Gio. The idea that nuclear is dangerous is what is promoted.

Oil and gas industry LOVE 'renewables' because turbines and panels are totally dependent on fossil fuel. Nuclear isn't.
6905 2018-04-17 10:36:04 Some false facts and guidelines that were suggested during #DeMonetisation and must be remembered during #CashCrunch too:
1. #Cashless is better for India
2. #Modi is best for India,
3. If we stop using cars/fuel for useless travels, it'll pinch Oil companies.
TBH #3 is true.

6940 2018-04-17 10:30:05 ..how about allowing oil to flow to BC (to mitigate inter-provincial trade legal challenge) - but oil to flow by rail only - this would have the desired effect on BC idiocracy  - only drawback?  negatively affect grain shipments? #ableg #ab #pipelines

6946 2018-04-17 10:28:30 Dana there was something on ch 9 I think a few weeks ago you might be able to watch it on their catch up channel it was about using the oil to stop fits in children

6968 2018-04-17 10:24:45 The North without oil can survive well. All we will do is massively go back to our abandoned farmlands and you will beg  to buy beans, pepper, onions from us. Don't be deceived because any region that can feed it's citizens will survive.

I think the reason more countries aren't nuked is that it makes the Oil radioactive and more expensive to extract.
7032 2018-04-17 10:12:29 lower temp, slightly longer cooking time, and a longer draining period as the chicken will soak up more oil. Nowadays, I use an air fryer. 400F for 18 minutes for a small batch in that, perfect chicken, no oil, no draining.

Kill them by melting some coconut oil, let it cool down & gently paint it on them with small soft paintbrush. A child's paintbrush will do fine. They breathe through their skin so this seals & suffocates them!

You're being lied to Dan
7056 2018-04-17 10:09:39 oh, and you might consider cooking it at a slightly lower temp. the oil should "shimmer" (have the slightest disturbance to the surface) not have ripples or waves or bubbles.

7065 2018-04-17 10:08:22 next time, remove it from the oil about 3 minutes sooner and let it sit for the 3 minutes to drain the oil off. It'll keep cooking, won't look as burnt, and will be less oily/greasy. Also, if you cook it with bones, let it drain bone down.

7074 2018-04-17 10:06:10 People are increasingly unhappy with measly 3-4% annual yields on investments. So they’re willing to navigate the snake oil to make those multi X gains on their principal. That kind of money is always going to attract some unsavoury types.
7075 2018-04-17 10:05:37 There is a lot of argument on this.. Loss making OMC were eating into the tax payers money and huge oil debt was left unpaid....Please check.. We want petrol/LPG at currrent international price when they fall and want subsidy when they rise ?

7303 2018-04-17 09:25:25 Yes was a good weekend with great guests, some of whom returned from last year! But a bit soggy Sunday 

We are out for pretty much most of the week now (after sorting our oil out) and photos of us are always welcome 
7304 2018-04-17 09:25:09 So true as some land for sale signs read "Own a piece of America" but what they did not say you will never pay for it and if by some chance you do you will not own the mineral right - just in case there is oil or something of value under it

7865 2018-04-17 07:28:19 They want to cut, but are on hold due to the perpetual inflationary threat from rising oil prices, and higher deficits. WPI matters less than CPI; although a strong INR, low food prices and prospect of a good monsoon helps. To me, this MPC has more Hawks than doves, so..

8047 2018-04-17 06:55:56 One thing that US might have overlooked in its trade war with China. US exports to China near 25% of its total oil export. This is only 2% of China's import. Suppose China stops importing US oil at $70 a barrel, what will happen? No problem for China, but great headache for US.

* Oil Exploration
* Revampin Rice, G/Nut Cotton & Ginger Farming
* Road Network Across Region
* Oil Pipeline Ajaokuta to Kano

8093 2018-04-17 06:48:23 Yes, until 1943 German production was able to keep up with demand, with the only shortages coming from standard oil. Obviously there were signs things would get bad when scaled up but in general things were okay until the early 43

8096 2018-04-17 06:47:33 See second paragraph in image, which says that plastic is currently NOT recycled into plastic. Issue isn't energy-friendliness, it's about being able to reduce need for oil to make plastic.

8099 2018-04-17 06:47:05 Yes, it is amazing how we have the technology to dig up oil from deep in the ground, refine it, process it, and turn it into plastic through complex chemistry. 
But we can't do anything to recycle the end product. Go figure.

8275 2018-04-17 06:14:50 hmm. both of those contain some unnecessary ingredients that just sound nice. You might want to try oil cleansing first to remove makeup, and switch to a moisturizer with niacinamide in it. CeraVe AM is a good option for most people.

8342 2018-04-17 06:02:20 Really , all you here about is the ones that don't want it , what about the ones that do ? What about their rights for their people ? Do they not deserve to be heard ? Do you know how much oil is shipped out of California and the gulf of Mexico with no problems ?
8343 2018-04-17 06:02:19 Change my oil today with mobile one plus got new windshield wipers yesterday
8344 2018-04-17 06:01:50 A sinking ship full of coal is a little easier to deal with than a sinking ship full of oil - likely to do much less damage. A coal train derailment is also easier to deal with than a Burt’s pipeline in a watershed, or residential area.

8345 2018-04-17 06:01:46 fml I just cooked shirtless with hot oil
8346 2018-04-17 06:01:25 A thought occurs. Check what black market activity in petrol running occurred during the oil crisis years of 1970s NZ.
8347 2018-04-17 06:01:17 My Monday night routine:

- cleanse and tone with Witch Hazel
- moisturize with organic coconut oil
- shatter light fixture into ONE MILLION pieces
- embed fine glass powder into feet and hair
- beauty rest ! 
8348 2018-04-17 06:01:09 Can you not see the big picture?  Its the fact we are all now on the mersey of a subsidized foreign BIG oil company.  We pay them to do business in Canada. They refine & send the gas back at huge profits

8351 2018-04-17 06:00:40 Someone asked me if my photos are edited. -- Yes. I would never lie about that. -- Very Minimum editing, but yes, editing & cropping. -- Even when I worked in a dark room, we edited photos with dodging, burning, filter, and oil techniques.

8355 2018-04-17 06:00:01 thee- oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all things are the best. How hast thou behaved hitherto to the nature of anything, whatever
8356 2018-04-17 05:59:36 Let me get this straight- the BC govt is hell-bent on stopping the #KinderMorgan pipeline expansion, but if the AB govt starts rationing oil/gas/energy to BC & gas prices skyrocket, they’ll sue?  This is looking more like a professional-level tantrum by BC 
8357 2018-04-17 05:59:17 Foam cleanser, oil cleanser, toner, essence, moisturizer, sunscreen, sleeping mask, face scrubs, sheet masks, face mask... damn I don’t wanna think about how much they cost altogether
8358 2018-04-17 05:59:16 He didn’t start a civil war, isil was created by remnants of the old Iraqi military after the war in Iraq. Until then, Assad was a close friend of the EU and the U.K. in particular...His crime? Trying to take away the dollar value from oil, guess which other countries also tried?
8359 2018-04-17 05:59:00 Indeed. Minister @jamespeshaw wants the Climate Commission to give an “independent and expert view” to “take politics out of.. politically charged questions”. That would have been a great forum in which to consider the future of oil and gas in NZ before making a decision.
8360 2018-04-17 05:58:39 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!

8367 2018-04-17 05:56:30 The U.S. started exporting oil over two years ago. No oil spill yet. In fact, over 50 million barrels move by ocean tanker, EVERY DAY. As more people are enlightened your spill argument becomes weaker and weaker.

8370 2018-04-17 05:56:20 *Alberta cuts off BC's oil supply*

*AB and SK lose their ability to send their products through BC ports*

*Bicycle sales skyrocket*

*Govt invests in green energy*

Our economy already sucks from real estate speculation, and low wages. This kind of "reset" might help us.

8397 2018-04-17 05:48:59 I sure hope we aren't being "played".  Horgan creates the situation for Notley and Trudeau to ride to the rescue, except the rescuers are both on record as being anti-oil.  Laws are passed for greater control over oil.  Nationalized without firing a shot.

Behind closed doors are they in fact aiding the middle east agenda?!

8421 2018-04-17 05:43:36 Did @MBuhari borrow the money to buy cows in his Daura farm? He was forced to borrow because the likes of you and your principal sold oil at the highest, met the reserve at its highest but stole all and mismanaged the ones you couldn't steal.

8431 2018-04-17 05:42:29 Lets be clearer. 
1)Governments are about their people not all the people. 
2) Oil companies only make profit after the have paid all their workers, contractors, suppliers, etc.
3) many of their shareholders are retirement funds
4) oil company profit is why 2) and3) do well.
8432 2018-04-17 05:42:26 @CanadaAction So, does BC want product coming down the pipe or not?  BC NDP want to sue to get some? “B.C. Attorney General David Eby threatening to sue Alberta over legislation it introduced to restrict the flow of oil, gasoline and natural gas ..”.  They be confused ..LOL

8443 2018-04-17 05:41:06 Well, that would be the point of CBD oil. It only has some medicinal properties and lacks the THC required for it to “do it for you”. I do recommend actual cannabis over alcohol though for many reasons. I would avoid edibles if you haven’t tried smoking or vaping it though.
8444 2018-04-17 05:41:05 And, and, K, it comes through the Port of Vancouver and gets trucked or trained to Alberta and beyond. If we pay, you pay! AB loses $ everyday it's shut off too. It makes no sense Leave the bitumen in the ground. What's wrong with conventional oil?
8445 2018-04-17 05:40:26 Iran is independent minded with oil. Pakistan is tributary of China. Which one you would choose?

8451 2018-04-17 05:39:38 But still in other countries oil and gas are available in half the price than that of india post 2014..why?because  modi reduced the subsidy given on each cylinder, otherwise it would have come around 350.. because he thot reduced subsidy amt 350 will go for other activities

8457 2018-04-17 05:38:41 NATO force for Middle East was proposed few years ago but oil price was hovering around $20.
Now at $70 appear a better sell for the Americans.
But Arab countries(Gulf & KSA) have pressing domestic needs particularly in education and economic diversification away from oil.
8458 2018-04-17 05:38:36 So they plan to seal the robbing of a very oil rich part of Syria with the help of jihadist supporters. Kurds happy with this?
8459 2018-04-17 05:38:27 Now that the oil price has soared high(highest in 3 years), I hope the narrative of the previous govt having it all and squandered it all will stop. Just tired of baseless excuses. @DemolaRewaju @MrStanleyNwabia

8493 2018-04-17 05:30:04 Where the hell do you think your oil comes from if not from Alberta and Saskatchewan?  I say no ships to ocean ports. No planes to airports. Sound stupid?  Because it is. Let’s starve ourselves to prove to others we are dumb enough to do it.

8503 2018-04-17 05:28:08 will try oil on canvas
8504 2018-04-17 05:28:04 If you do, i recommend them. All the good stuff in tea helps it heal and the clove oil numbs the pain. Just soak it a lil and put it against the sore for like >20 mins
8505 2018-04-17 05:27:34 At a top level view though - future investment should be in technologies that, when they fail (not if) cause very limited damage to the environment. If a solar panel fails it’s not likely to as much damage as a deep sea oil rig.
8506 2018-04-17 05:27:33 sorry bambi. I happen to take a break off here to change the oil otherwise, tweets will sound all the same and boring. Naye ndi steady. this was meant to take two years but some how, I chose to cut it short.  I have been well meanwhile. no poisoning at all. 
8507 2018-04-17 05:27:25 What double talk Horgan-weaver don't want the pipeline but will sue if Alberta restricts the flow of oil products to BC. Hypocrites and no they don't speak for all of BC

8514 2018-04-17 05:26:32 So much room for competition. And we really need more EV to give impact on big oil industries.
8515 2018-04-17 05:26:24 Data is the new oil so it’s getting harder and harder to find an app (even paid) that doesn’t suck up all my data. OmniFocus and Things 3 seem the best.  Although Things 3 could encrypt before it leaves the device as per OmniFocus.

8521 2018-04-17 05:25:26 Because oil companies can get away with gouging us by charging that much for it. It's utterly shameful.

8525 2018-04-17 05:25:09 Mills “if we believe in climate change” sounding impartial before lauding the govt for being responsible on their gas and oil policy. 

Is it not irresponsible to push ahead with policy based on unsettled science?

@MatthewHootonNZ at least speaks to the fallacy of its impact.
8526 2018-04-17 05:25:07 tonight i feel really wild. and like i want to go to the oil spill. and just live life. if this feeling continues til wednesday i’m gonna go.

8540 2018-04-17 05:21:44 I'm not anti-oil dude.  I'm pro-TM.  Pointing out niche cases where oil must continue to be used doesn't change the economics of a world commodity though.  A tiny drop in overall demand kills the price.  That kills Alberta oil.

8567 2018-04-17 05:15:52 So did you believe JT misspoke when he said we needed to phase out the oil sands. Pretty sure that caused zero wedge whatsoever between Albertans and the federal government. Let's phase out hydro in qc, lumber in bc, and mfg in on while we're at it!
8568 2018-04-17 05:15:26 America and other countries have lots of interest in Syria and do not want Russia to have the upper hand. That's basically it. They don't care about the people of Syria. Never will never have. Syria and other countries are needed for oil and pipelines etc.

8612 2018-04-17 05:08:18 She’s got it out for B.C. First, the wine ban, now threatening to shut off the oil and gas taps! We just want to protect our coastline! Sheesh:) Really not a winning approach. And First Nations need to be in on this whole thing.
8613 2018-04-17 05:08:17 The issue you are missing is this is a case of relative risk. We already have tankers and oil-by-rail that pose a risk and the pipeline represents an alternative risk scenario, which actually reduces the risks to the coast.
8614 2018-04-17 05:08:12 Yes, it’s an all out assault on the environment, humanity & Western Democracy. Putin needs oil, money & power... all of which the current imposed sanctions have halted. Today dotard stalled add’l sanctions for now. Hmmm
8615 2018-04-17 05:07:34 Canada ranks 2nd in oil exports, Canada and Alberta are in serious debt, is that in the national interest? Why should they be trusted. Horgan for new prime minister of British Columbia
8616 2018-04-17 05:07:01 Lmao we are forced to use cause they do not allow the world to use all oil free products! We would be using a lot more hemp products if people in power did not have money rollin in from oil companies!
8617 2018-04-17 05:06:26 Hope you RoS guys using the chemical factory oil tank bug to hide inside enjoy your bans.
8618 2018-04-17 05:06:23 Is rail safe enough between BC and AB to transport oil?

Morning: wash, exfoliate, rose water spray, colloidal silver spray, vitamin C serum, moisturizer 
Night: wash, rose water spray, colloidal silver spray, vitamin c serum, Clindamycin (gel), rose hip oil
All this is accompanied by less makeup wear, more sleep, and better diet

8623 2018-04-17 05:04:02 Washed my hair again but this time I didn’t load it with oil lol it’s soft  and my scalp feels soooo good 
8624 2018-04-17 05:03:59 The popularity of it might have gone down, as mustard oil is banned in the US (and probably other parts of the world). I had a look at the manufacturers site, and they dont seem to call it Mustard Oil now, rather Pungent Oil!! You are right, its an exceptional oil.
8625 2018-04-17 05:03:41 Keep oil wells out of our pristine waters - I appreciate your diligence Senator!
8626 2018-04-17 05:03:34 The report further gets the margins wrong. Heavy oil actually has higher margins and much lower bottoms (pet coke byproducts) than light oils. The author clearly doesn't understand this fact and thus makes a number of fundamental errors in the piece. 3/

8631 2018-04-17 05:02:49 Giving subsidies to a US corporation is just plain wrong. The risk of spills should trump getting oil to market.  Do you seriously think KML.T is going to pay for 100% of a clean up? #theyneverdo

8635 2018-04-17 05:02:27 Create more jobs for WA. Putting in some low risk oil well technology = cheap energy. We have learned from the past and odds for a spill are quite low. Plus it provides living wage jobs. Those can provide for a spouse to stay at home and raise the kids. #ImAnEnergyVoter #MAGA
8636 2018-04-17 05:02:27 Foreign entities are paying them to stop moving pollution, just oil and gas
8637 2018-04-17 05:02:16 The author claims that the large excess of light oil in the US somehow addresses the shortage of heavy crudes in the US market. The US exports light and imports heavy because their refineries are tuned to heavy oils and need it for an input 2/
8638 2018-04-17 05:02:06 Mate, admit you're wrong. May only had to recall Parliment. She broke the rule. Ok the evidence seemed to be there in video but was it recent, was it Assad? Likelihood yes. It's all about oil and sucking up to the US and anyone with half a brain knows that

8644 2018-04-17 05:01:24 @kenjilopezalt Hey someone needs to come up with a name for the good feeling you get when you use olive oil for anything (coating pizza dough or sautéing something). You're well situated for the task, what do you think?
8645 2018-04-17 05:01:07 No shame in my underpants with a watermelon on my oil tank by myself before my wife and I ran out of context.

8651 2018-04-17 05:00:34 I know this and I know about what happened in Alberta. You also know that we have the safest method of moving oil through the waterways as well. You might want to research that as well. They were successful in the clean up.

But no, these ppl are just stuck in their oil lobbying, gov subsidizing ways, no conscience or ethics
8655 2018-04-17 04:59:34 Public mood at the moment is just anti BJP. How will BJP deal with ever rising global crude oil price. A nymex crude oil ove $80 will imply petrol at 100 per litre.
8656 2018-04-17 04:59:32 Castor oil is an everyday essential....it transformed my eyebrows and eyelashes..
8657 2018-04-17 04:59:01 Excellent cherry picking. Charts end at 2012 before oil prices plummeted. Suspect if you did the same on the last few years, it would tell a different story.

8663 2018-04-17 04:57:33  I’m working on a thicker hair oil (more for use with protective styling) that incorporates Wild Hair Growth oil. I’ve been playing around with it to get it not to smell like concrete Lolol now it smells more like papaya and mango lol
8664 2018-04-17 04:56:49 My theory is that the US bombed the Middle East because they didn’t sell oil in US dollars but instead another form of currency..so it affected our markets and value of a dollar. 
8665 2018-04-17 04:56:40 It goes something like:

“Fire ants, fire ants,
Make us dance.
Guns tucked into
everyone’s pants!
Hostile summers
and weird politics
mix with hicks for oil slicks.
Half the folks listen
to the shrieking Alex Jones,
So I’m just thankful for the
USDA planting zones.”
8666 2018-04-17 04:56:18 This is Trump’s way of setting up Putin and Russia for an easy takeover of Saudi Arabia, and their vast oil supply and ports, not to mention the massive land grab in the Middle East. This is another intentional giveaway to Putin.
8667 2018-04-17 04:56:18 This wind makes me want to climb on the roof of people’s houses to oil their squeaky vent that spins and creates that annoying sound like nails zig zagging yet intermittently stopping on a chalk board.  #fixyourlife #makeitstop

8672 2018-04-17 04:55:36 I would definitely reduce the amount I drive at $2. Time for an electric. Aside from gas, beef & F-150s, almost everything sold in Alberta passes through the port of Vancouver. Oil is only one part of the economy. Does Alberta want to pay a steep tariff on all imported goods?

Sadly Syria has too much oil and gas that America and Europe want/need.

#bcpoli #vanpoli
8700 2018-04-17 04:51:41 People are fooling themselves if they think oil and gas won't be just as important in 50 years. Things won't move as quickly as you think. Glad the Prime Minister sees that. Ignoring the very vocal,and often paid,minority is the way to proceed to continued prosperity.

8747 2018-04-17 04:42:43 Long game guess: BC NDP match Alberta's oil holding play by increasing Spec Tax paid by Alt residents owning BC properties. Alt residents either buck up or sell = a win for BC NDP... Just a thought.

8767 2018-04-17 04:39:59 So BC wants to control flow of bitumen WITHIN B.C. And Alberta will (perhaps, maybe not) try to control flow of oil/gas INTO BC. Just so we’re clear. #bcpoli #AbLeg

8773 2018-04-17 04:39:14 I'm personally a HUGE fan of Aura Cacia's frankincense blend. I use it on my lower back when I have pain or cramps. Blended stuff (with jojoba oil, usually) is OK for use directly on skin if you're not usually sensitive to creams or lotions.
8774 2018-04-17 04:39:09 That sounds absolutely disgusting. But I'm averse to microwaved food in general. Get fresh veggies, put them in an oventray, put some mozzarella on them, add oil, rosemary and oregano, put in oven at 180C until cheese is molten. Enjoy.

8776 2018-04-17 04:38:56 My favorite preparation for broccoli: mince 2 cloves garlic, chop head of broccoli. Heat 1 Tbl oil in a large pan, add 1 tsp mustard seeds. When they start popping, add garlic, stir 30 secs, add broccoli, stir, cover for a minute, add a little water and salt, cover to steam, eat!
8777 2018-04-17 04:38:52 Yes but I used it because it’s to only way to cook chicken without adding flavour (from oil, salt etc)

8779 2018-04-17 04:38:45 Rinse and bake with some olive oil and sea salt. Then they are crunchy delicious in your salad. Or skip them cuz they cost like $1 ;)

8793 2018-04-17 04:35:41 thats the spirit, i heard clove oil can help with tooth pain.........
8794 2018-04-17 04:35:39 This is dangerous. If abused could lead to mass exodus of oil companies in Alberta. It's a slippery slope. Best option would be feds withhold spending to bc until they let the pipeline be built.
8795 2018-04-17 04:35:31 I CAN HELP my mom's been into them for years and I am a non-believer with 18 vials in my house...

SO: yes to putting them in a hot bath. That's my favorite. Five drops is magic.

You can buy a diffuser, which combines the oil with water and aerosolizes them.

8800 2018-04-17 04:35:00 We’ve seen commemorations morphed from contemplating the horror of war, to being some nationalistic cry for more war. It happened during the Howard years, when they needed to justify new wars for oil. The monuments get co-opted very easily :(

8808 2018-04-17 04:34:00 I wonder if there's an essential oil that smells strong enough to distract me from the sensation of pain until I can ask for better pain meds at my muscular dystrophy specialist appointment in June. Yes, I already have the earliest available appointment.

He’s a farmer and miner without mentioning the names of his company.

Very Very big liar.

8813 2018-04-17 04:32:44 This will backfire on Alberta. Notley cannot continue to threaten and bully the people of BC in order to get her own way. The Oil doesn’t belong to her it’s under Federal jurisdiction. BC has a right to stick up for its sensitive Coastal Area. She needs to get off her high horse.

8815 2018-04-17 04:32:34 You cancel permits for oil and gas transmission just like our greatest Premier Mr. Lougheed did. Period full stop. How long did it take Trudeau 1.0 to cancel his insane socializing of our energy industry. BC would be in a world of hurt with no jet fuel, diesel for ferries etc.

8824 2018-04-17 04:31:26 The fact that Petrol prices are almost as high NOW as they were when OIL was over $100 a barrel shows that there is that atypical naked Australian style profiteering going. Price gouging has become our favourite national past-time #auspol #oilprice

8885 2018-04-17 04:21:00 "...disused palisade and many little lamps of oil, already glimmering against the coming night..."
8886 2018-04-17 04:20:58 running out of oil is the most depressing
8887 2018-04-17 04:20:57 Mslhnya mmg nk oil cleanser. What else do you hv
8888 2018-04-17 04:20:46 To my mate? Lavender oil, stale sawdust, beeswax, warm cotton & coffee. To everyone else, lavender oil, sickly sweet maple syrup, and caffeine sweats.
8889 2018-04-17 04:20:42 Me neither. However there has been enough proof out there that some illnesses seem to be helped by cannabis oil...not getting high. I think CB is still illegal in many states? Particularly ppl with tremors n seizures, muscular n neurological illnesses.

8891 2018-04-17 04:20:38 This take is hotter than the oil they boil cheetos in.
8892 2018-04-17 04:20:35 Ok. Where do you think the Oil Kings get their overage players from next year.
8893 2018-04-17 04:20:28 But but. They don’t want clean Alberta oil?? Give your heads a shake BC, shame on you
8894 2018-04-17 04:19:56 Oh yeah. Plus they let you try them all. Olive oil is way better than you might think.
8895 2018-04-17 04:19:54 I AM THANKFUL FOR PEPPERMINT ESSENTIAL OIL GOODNIGHT
8896 2018-04-17 04:19:50 Embezzled oil money
8897 2018-04-17 04:19:50 Are you a Russian troll lobbying for big oil @bogieman1445 ?
8898 2018-04-17 04:19:35 I feel like the people who made this Belgard commercial have never actually used a grill before.

You *probably* don't want to pour just a ton of olive oil over a bunch of whole bell peppers on an already-hot grill.
8899 2018-04-17 04:19:10 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。

8904 2018-04-17 04:18:03 Km is a pipeline company not an oil extractor.
8905 2018-04-17 04:17:51 Just a little thought to ponder upon.. 1 lk crore from crude oil engines.. the next 9 lk crore will be from electric. Hopefully, you guys will be bringing a lot more models in electric for me to change my car.
8906 2018-04-17 04:17:49 Nothing only to award oil wells to northern oligarchs

8912 2018-04-17 04:16:58 Yeah we remember that theft was made more popular when the Late afrobeat king referenced it in his song “ 2.8 Billion Naira, Oil money issi missing “ 
How did we elect a covert kleptomaniac as president of  , former president OBJ & Thiefnubu are both  Yoruba sell-outs.
8913 2018-04-17 04:16:40 What’s the cheapest place in the fort to get an oil change
8914 2018-04-17 04:16:32 Yes. It would be great if Notley would shut off taps to BC & Washington State. Early 70s oil crisis led to all sorts of positive changes. We can get enough for essential services from Alaska.
8915 2018-04-17 04:16:29 No but it might have something to do with oil pipelines which connect mid East oil to the Med.
BTW What is your reaction to Robert Fisks article in the Independent?
8916 2018-04-17 04:16:26 coconut oil is heavenly
8917 2018-04-17 04:16:24 Tea tree oil is the shit

8921 2018-04-17 04:16:02 I literally can’t remember the last time I went grocery shopping, I have NO food in my fridge & NO snacks therefore I’m currently in bed eating a plain baguette. by itself. not even with olive oil or butter. is this it? is this rock bottom? is this what poverty feels like?
8922 2018-04-17 04:16:00 Peppermint or lavender oil
8923 2018-04-17 04:15:54 It actually does. Canadian social programs are great. Money in the Canadian economy will support renewables. Imports lead to debt mostly owed to countries that won't invest in RE like Canada will. It's a paradox but I have faith you'll get it. 3billion went to oil imports in dec.
8924 2018-04-17 04:15:45 trivia: before they used to cook Max's fried chicken in pure pork lard. Tiniis kong hindi kumain when I learned about that. yun daw kasi nagpapa sarap. pero ngayon palm oil na daw (bad oil pa rin pero masarap pa rin! wahahaha).
8925 2018-04-17 04:15:19 Good 2 know where do u get krill oil?  Also on Coumadin 4 factor 5 so INR is all messed up!
8926 2018-04-17 04:15:08 That is not generosity. Its a government gone rogue and drunk from Arab oil money and chinese real estate buying.
8927 2018-04-17 04:15:00 Meee

8928 2018-04-17 04:14:50 Holy smoke screen... Making it look like it's all about the politics and hurting BC when all I see is the Alberta government taking complete control of the flow of oil and gas... Just another way to choke the oil companies
8929 2018-04-17 04:14:40 My friends use to joke about me dying for oil after i joined the army... well look out Syria here I come #WWIII
8930 2018-04-17 04:14:39 Y'gotta love it when you hungry and decided to fry some Ayamas chicken only to find them pots we for frying is dirty with old-ass oil

2 hours later, you come back up with a pot of instant pasta, watching YouTube thinking that's a brilliant way to get me wash dirty af pots
8931 2018-04-17 04:14:23 Do SC/MJ have a lot of 19 year old players? If they do maybe the Oil Kings can acquire 1 or 2 as overagers.
8932 2018-04-17 04:14:11 The hot chips, while desirable, would mean a trip back in to town.  Instead I've just put a couple of spuds and sweet potato in the microwave.  I'll add cheese, sour cream and garlic chives, plus olive oil, salt and pepper.  Maybe some sweet chilli sauce ;-)
8933 2018-04-17 04:14:10 Buffalo said San Jose was the only team to call. No idea how the Oil don't at minimum send them an email. Oh well

8941 2018-04-17 04:13:30 I want to get a fishbowl, fill it with coconut oil, and rock it SpongeBob style for my itchy MF dreads.

8946 2018-04-17 04:12:59 And in it, there is the AP making part of the same gaffe, plus suggesting the PM must build KM pipeline, rather than stick to his campaign promise of winding down oil subsidies.
8947 2018-04-17 04:12:44 My dads stage 4 multiple myeloma cancer.. From being exposed to Agent Orange in the Vietnam war. From chemo he had a hard time eating if he even had an appetite.

8948 2018-04-17 04:12:27 Check dekat packaging or dekat website to be sure.

If dia ada state waterproof/water resistant/washable with face wash, better guna oil/wipes/micellar water to remove em first.
8949 2018-04-17 04:12:26 Yessss! Unfortunate part is it takes a good two weeks for the oil to settle in.

8960 2018-04-17 04:09:44 Who would've thought of #Trudeau as a socialist who proposes to nationalise #Alberta's oil & gas industry? 
Or is this a whole new meaning of corporate welfare re financing #KinderMorgan with no regard to fiscal responsibility?
If investors are backing out, maybe so should we?
8961 2018-04-17 04:09:38 and trust me, Susan... I'm a realist, thus no lover of HRC! But Trump is a disaster... I didn't like Bush Jr. either but nothing like what we are experiencing now.  He is dangerous to our nation. You say he is protecting the Constitution..I say he spits on it!
8962 2018-04-17 04:09:37 Fascinating I have just watched the @CBCNATIONAL plus @CTV_Television nightly news not one mention of the almost 300,000 litres of an oil spill in Northern #AB today! #bcpoli #cdnpoli #abpoli #StopKM #ProtecttheInlet
8963 2018-04-17 04:09:28 Yaga, and ask you must pour oil on and explained the comb.
8964 2018-04-17 04:09:26 Shhh, don’t let the oil companies hear you. 
8965 2018-04-17 04:09:03 Seems to me that Northern Gateway was going to be to tidewater through Kitimat BC. That was scuttled by Trudeau when he took office. He put the moratorium on oil tankers and that was the kiss of death for that pipeline.
8966 2018-04-17 04:08:51 Winds are making my truck need a oil change
8967 2018-04-17 04:08:51 Oil burner shutoff switches are mounted that high, though usually marked with a red wall plate.
8968 2018-04-17 04:08:34 I scrubbed my face with brown sugar and coconut oil after shaving and now my face is distractingly smooth
8969 2018-04-17 04:08:26 15years after the invasion of Iraq, & now largely out of the glare of the media, US & UK oil corporations start to flaunt the spoils of imperial conquest. British oil & gas company BP won the contract to operate the Rumaila Oil Field back in 2009. Yes, the Iraq War was about oil.
8970 2018-04-17 04:08:20 Feeling drained but Ik taking a chamomile bath with my candles and crystals would totally rejuvenate. But I ran out o coconut oil and I’m probably gonna have to use  lotion when I haven’t used it in years. But I have to buy it from the store and my mom is by gonna let me go  ugh
8971 2018-04-17 04:08:16 I was told tee tree oil helps with pimples.. so I put it on a pimple and now my face is on fire 
8972 2018-04-17 04:08:14 from what he was describing...pretty much just a salad

but like the kind of salad it costs way too much money to prepare with 3-4 fats like avocado and coconut oil and lots of seeds and yeasts and such, on top of dark leafy greens

...basically the kinda of salads I like most
8973 2018-04-17 04:08:08 I used an Alton Brown guide, so I thought it would be a good start D:

Also only used canola oil, so I'll try that next time.

8975 2018-04-17 04:07:54 thanks @East_Conn !!!!!
8976 2018-04-17 04:07:54 I believe oil production has its place in Canada. We produce what we need. We refine what we need. We keep our resources for our needs. When the oil in the world becomes depleted by small minds with no vision.  We will be a stronger nation if we conserve our resources. #StopKM

8985 2018-04-17 04:05:54 These are the same west coast clowns who can’t rationalize where meat comes from other than “the grocery store where it’s sold in cellophane covered packages”. In a few weeks, these idiots will understand how much their lives and the BC economy are dependent upon oil & gas.

8988 2018-04-17 04:05:24 Of course it is rising. Republicsns are owned by oil barons.

Under Bush2 it rose to more than $4/gal..
That caused the economy to crash. 
And banks collapsed under their own mortgage scams. 

But of course gas prices will rise. The GOP pays their oil baron owners what they want.
8989 2018-04-17 04:05:21 Either way oil is going to make its way to the ports. Either the KinderMorgan pipeline which will get built or it’s going to go on train. Start thinking important like what about the $40,000,000 lost everyday from people like you who are delaying this pipeline. #BuildKM

9006 2018-04-17 04:03:38 So you offer no alternative other than there is no alternative. The oil sands are a big part of the county’s economy. We, as a country, put demands and strict conditions on the pipeline, which KM has followed, without compromise. They followed the rules and won. Let them work.
9007 2018-04-17 04:03:22 the middle East is literally sand covering oil

9021 2018-04-17 04:01:38 See I would make my own Body Lava or buy a cheaper version but I make my Fenty purchases for Rihanna, not for me. If she wants 59 of my dollars for some oil and glitter then that's what she'll get

9027 2018-04-17 04:00:53 hahaha shame on me! thats funny. I'm not saying its our fault but don't be naive. We came out unscathed from WWII and took opportunities.  We had the bomb until USSR stole it from us! & they haven't gotten over us turning their world upside-down. Think like the enemy, Susan
9028 2018-04-17 04:00:48 None of the fake purist protestors  are at St Lawrence River ports, either, for those foreign oil tankers up and down the River. And who knows what bilge they're dumping in Canadian waters?
9029 2018-04-17 04:00:39 Just checking in, I’m directly inhaling peppermint essential oil from my diffuser and playing with my Otomatone. Current status: lifted.

Our bodies & environment are being systematically poisoned for profit.

9034 2018-04-17 04:00:27 You see here is the difference and note I should wait did @andrew_leach but I shan’t Stelmach anticipated this. He understood what the market could bare while also meeting Alberta’s obligations. He understood you can’t can’t oil and gas development without balancing the environ.
9035 2018-04-17 04:00:27 I just got out of a warm shower. I tried the cold, but our house is freezing at the moment. I put on coconut oil and took some Midol that was by my bed.
9036 2018-04-17 04:00:13 I support the growing economic boom of green energy. I DO NOT and WILL NOT support an expansion of dirty oil in a crucial time of climate change. This already threatened ocean and dwindling orca population does not need the additional risk of a spill by 7fold tanker traffic.
9037 2018-04-17 04:00:12 thank goodness @courtneyjs14 got a new essential oil diffuser because I got her old one!!!
9038 2018-04-17 04:00:10 Let's rebuild the whale oil industry!! Cutting blocks of peat from bogs will take lots of labor, and cow pies make a great fire if you dry them out.

9042 2018-04-17 03:59:56 Well that’s the media portrayals but remember Russia and USA are fighting for oil transportation routs.goes way deeper but that’s a start
9043 2018-04-17 03:59:54 This Vitamin e oil better help @caitlynisabella

9046 2018-04-17 03:59:39 どんなのにしたん？
9047 2018-04-17 03:59:39 Don’t you think that if the issue can be resolved without enforcing reduced exports of oil that would be better? After all, a reduction would hurt Alberta too with reduced revenues. It may also force B.C. to to seek oil from elsewhere. Once a customer is lost, they may not return

9049 2018-04-17 03:58:39 this Jamaican black castor oil is really making a difference in my eyebrows. i won’t need Anastasia anymore soon 
9050 2018-04-17 03:58:13 Maybe you require military support to clean up your current pipeline spill of 290,000 litres of oil and saltwater in northern Alberta.  The denial of the inevitability of pipeline spills is pathetic. Time to evolve and move forward with cleaner technologies. It's long overdue.
9051 2018-04-17 03:57:51 She didn’t have sex with POTUS, if any sex was 12 yrs ago when it was perform was just Mr. Donald Trump. So what? Donald if he did, paid her for services rendered like any prostitute. She was a well oil Machine at the time. Now she  operates for cheaper price as a broken machine

9055 2018-04-17 03:57:01 I just wanna buy an oil diffuser and some chlorophyll for everyone that I love. Life changing tings
9056 2018-04-17 03:56:53 Hey @JustinTrudeau why do I read that both we and France will be "doubling down" on climate change action, and yet you're all about putting in a pipeline for the dirtiest oil in the world? Am I missing something?
9057 2018-04-17 03:56:50 No but it’s half preference, I don’t like fish. Once in a while (like once a week) I take fish oil supplements though
9058 2018-04-17 03:56:11 Hahahaha..makati din ba pag crude oil?
9059 2018-04-17 03:56:07 Tin... Cleansing oil kau gune ape..?? Dah lama aku try nak beli untuk double cleansing tapi tak tau nak beli brand ape.. kau gune HL ke..??
9060 2018-04-17 03:55:45 @TheBodyShop your tea tree oil for blemished skin is a wonder !! Love it and result were almost instant :) 
9061 2018-04-17 03:55:44 I didn’t notice a difference myself, plus the coconut oil ruins the taste
9062 2018-04-17 03:55:39 “should I just get a new car so I dont have to get an oil change!?” pinshhe @araselihrndz_ se pasaa 
9063 2018-04-17 03:55:19 It depends on if the oil is properly preblended, like in American brands such as JIF, or Skippy. In many Canadian store brands the oil separates,  in these creamy is preferable as the salt content is much higher. I eat peanut butter, ever day of my life. Every, single, day.
9064 2018-04-17 03:55:14 "And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons."

9070 2018-04-17 03:54:04 Ay ang sarap sa feeling kae. Ako naman salonpas and efficascent oil. Haha
9071 2018-04-17 03:53:48 I'd rather join with Manitoba, who also has significant oil reserves, and upgrade the Churchill port - we'd be crazy rich.
9072 2018-04-17 03:53:45 Government really tryna go take over Syria fa the oil. sad.
9073 2018-04-17 03:53:20 You could always flood the oil market again. Drop the oil prices..... You know is one of Russia’s major exports.
9074 2018-04-17 03:53:08 I only ever get a zinger box  and my wicked wings  always taste like burnt oil 
9075 2018-04-17 03:53:03 You were saying that UAE made themselves on their own but there wouldn't be any UAE without British protectorate and west investing in oil reserves. So can we agree on that before moving to the subject of legitimacy?
9076 2018-04-17 03:53:00 Vegetable oil is recommended to season a cast iron skillet - which makes it an industrial product. 

Using it in actual food processing is commensurate to ingesting poison.

9080 2018-04-17 03:52:50 How about get rid of the NDP as an option? After all they did not win the election and don’t  necessarily speak for majority of BCers. Nobody wants oil spilled in their water or on their land. I think we all agree on that. But. It has to get to the coast somehow.

9083 2018-04-17 03:52:29 Do you support holding all imported O&G to the same standards of GHG emissions as Canadian oil?
9084 2018-04-17 03:52:27 You sound petty and jealous..did the Bushes or Cheney,give up their business interests or oil wells, did President Washington give any of his businesses. I would think if you are as successful as POTUS you have people suing constantly to get rich quick. Just more mud slinging.
9085 2018-04-17 03:52:22 honestly once you get into eating any other way feels weird. Like I don’t notice that I don’t have any oil in my house until
9086 2018-04-17 03:52:14 Awkward. Tastes like coconut oil.
9087 2018-04-17 03:52:10 Do you support holding all imported O&G to the same standards of GHG emissions as Canadian oil?
9088 2018-04-17 03:52:05 '｀ｨ(´∀｀∩
9089 2018-04-17 03:52:02 But while we are at it, if BC is going to sue Alberta for damages over restricting oil shipments, then the lawsuit against BC for damages for blocking KMX is racking up in the $millions per day....
9090 2018-04-17 03:51:57 I have no idea how you ascertained that I don't care about policy or country... I disapprove of Trump BECAUSE he is a poor POTUS.. immoral and possibly a criminal. Trump has clearly brought this to a level not seen in modern history which makes it about country for me!
9091 2018-04-17 03:51:57 Do you support holding all imported O&G to the same standards of GHG emissions as Canadian oil?

9093 2018-04-17 03:51:51 Cause a good rub down with some coconut oil would be everything
9094 2018-04-17 03:51:48 But Western Africa and Middle Eastern oil tankers go up and down the St-Lawrence River and the Great Lakes - 20% OF THE WORLD’S FRESH WATER - without anyone even care. Proof that all this charade WAS NEVER ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT.
9095 2018-04-17 03:51:47 To speed up hair growth, add a few drops of rosemary oil to your shampoo.
9096 2018-04-17 03:51:46 Do you support holding all imported O&G to the same standards of GHG emissions as Canadian oil?
9097 2018-04-17 03:51:39 Yes, that is why we have approved pipelines in our country. Do you support holding all imported O&G to the same standards of GHG emissions as Canadian oil?
9098 2018-04-17 03:51:38 Hada labo oil cleansing!
9099 2018-04-17 03:51:28 I used it on Brussels sprouts yesterday, worked super well. Just a little oil & vinegar
9100 2018-04-17 03:51:23 if you don’t have an essential oil diffuser you should really invest in one. eucalyptus essential oil helps so much with allergy season!!! 
9101 2018-04-17 03:51:16 The real reason Muammar Gaddafi was "removed" from Libya by Hillary Clinton

They were sitting on a TON of gold and he wanted to peg oil to gold and not the US dollar.
9102 2018-04-17 03:51:03 I’m not about to become one of those guys who talks about beard oil all the time but I really can feel such a difference in the health of my facial hair & the skin underneath over the last few weeks

9105 2018-04-17 03:50:37 Iran is a bad nation yes.  Saudi Arabia is far, far worse.  I wish like hell Russia would nuke their oil fields and rid their influence from this world.
9106 2018-04-17 03:50:13 I thought I was made of stone. I too have a daughter who has just this weekend had her first birthday, away at sea with work (oil exploration) and I fear leaving her but at least I have been present whereas this good family are suffering and the daughter will never meet her dad
9107 2018-04-17 03:50:02 Let’s do that with the oil companies!

9113 2018-04-17 03:49:09 Unfortunately you are absolutely right. The voice against oppression has a lot of hypocrites and full of discrimination when it comes to standing for the weakest. Africa, Afghanistan and Latin America is never on the radar. We only see countries with oil & their kins #AFG
9114 2018-04-17 03:49:04 Those are all Democratic Communists liberal lies Obama didn't do crap for our country he tried to destroy drilling for oil there was more people on welfare than ever before he did not create more jobs just about everything on that list is a lie and I can't believe the lies

9137 2018-04-17 03:46:17 Be with someone that helps oil your scalp at night
9138 2018-04-17 03:46:12 But olive oil is also fine. You just have to kind of adjust based on your skin. Everyone is different. Castor oil, sunflower seed oil, olive oil, and grape seed oil are all commonly used for facial cleansing. JUST NO COCONUT OIL.
9139 2018-04-17 03:46:10 Ao que parece em 1993 o Midnight Oil fez show no Maracanãzinho, houve uma inundação naquela noite e os caras caíram num buraco do estádio e morreram afogados

9146 2018-04-17 03:45:20 Castor oil and sunflower oil are better! Depending on your skin type tho, you may mix them. Oily skin: 30% castor - 70% sunflower. Regular skin: 20% castor oil - 80% sunflower. Dry Skin: 10% castor oil to 90% sunflower.

9161 2018-04-17 03:42:33 welp, not taking anything away from you or anything if you actually are a qualified doctor. But with the proven results and research of the still untapped potential of NATURAL CBD oil remedy’s helping heart problems how can you say it’s a “fake remedy”

The receptionist said in Japanese, "No. No, go do oil."
9181 2018-04-17 03:40:39 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.

9199 2018-04-17 03:38:47 10 yrs ago the oil price was far greater than today, so the differential didn’t matter. Since then, the US shale revolution took hold and the US’ reliance on foreign oil has waned. The US now has a NA option. And they know we have just one customer.
9200 2018-04-17 03:38:45 Yup. How much fuel do they keep burning flying around the world *talking* about climate change. All the *action* is subsidizing oil and pipelines. Such hypocrites.

For some reason I own a BMW...
9232 2018-04-17 03:34:00 Trudeau has levied a carbon tax on us, which only serves to allow the Gov't to overtax us —a way of taxing groceries, i.e., the carbon tax incurred with transporting goods is allowed 2b passed on to consumers! Meanwhile, he sides with Big Oil on building dangerous pipelines
9233 2018-04-17 03:33:50 @RecyclingBC heard you on @cbcradio today and I got to wondering. Have you started to consider cannabis industry waste? Health Canada wants virgin plastic for product packaging and there will no doubt be oil tanks and batteries galore in the near future. What’s your plan?
9234 2018-04-17 03:33:42 Thanks so much dude!! What I presumed was that the oils produced by the ground peanuts weren't substantial enough to make a big enough dent in the dryness of the protein powder, so I might try cutting in a lil coconut oil to see where that takes it

9266 2018-04-17 03:29:05 This is the typical zombie economics we've come to expect from Treasury.  Compared to the 'cost' of 'business as usual', ending new gas and oil permits is the bargain of the century.

9277 2018-04-17 03:26:57 If you truly cared for environment you would look at alternatives other than oil and gas and wouldn’t care if Alberta restricted the flow, why try to sue because we restricting flow #bcgovt all dumb politics. Go figure out life.

9289 2018-04-17 03:25:50 Mind to share Hada Labo punya oil cleanser tak? I ada baca some reviews on Simple product, ok jugak but still x berani nak try lagi for now i just guna cleanser tapi 2x cuci hahaha!
9290 2018-04-17 03:25:47 @HeyAprill What are your thoughts re: Sweet Almond Oil?
9291 2018-04-17 03:25:38 Yeah, I have more money now. Oh wait, gasoline just went up 30 cents.  Just gave up my profit to the oil companies.
9292 2018-04-17 03:25:31 Chinese refineries processed a record of more than 12.1 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in March, boosted by ample government import quotas and steady margins.
9293 2018-04-17 03:25:27 Amen

9300 2018-04-17 03:24:13 kalau boleh try guna cleansing oil yg takde mineral oil. takpun oil based cleanser lain macam cleansing balm, cleansing lotion
9301 2018-04-17 03:24:11 What the oil companies are saying is they have no buffer and no oil reserves otherwise the cost of oil now would not be passed on. They should be able to smooth the increases with the decreases instead of fleecing the public
9302 2018-04-17 03:24:00 And truffle oil.

9306 2018-04-17 03:23:19 Yes, but cannabis and its extract (oil) does have profound healing properties.
9307 2018-04-17 03:23:05 So if/when an oil spoil destroys the BC maritime economy are you going to help make financial restitution?
9308 2018-04-17 03:22:45 You'll get used to the feeling. Mas magandang maglagay ka ng oil or balm na hindi maganda lasa para everytime na maglilick ka ng lips, ireregret mo

9313 2018-04-17 03:22:21 So let me get the straight #bcgovt you don’t want Alberta to restrict oil any gas flow and yet you won’t let us build the pipeline because of environment but yet you want us to supply you with oil and gas, I’m sorry but you all are idiots, you can’t have it both ways.

9321 2018-04-17 03:21:11 Hi, my opinion u can  still double cleanse by using other than oil cleanser. Oil cleanser used to remove make up, oil, dirt and for deep cleansing kan. Used other cleanser with the same function
9322 2018-04-17 03:21:06 I googled one thing on safari abouy tea tree oil, now I’m seein ads of it all over fucking facebook
9323 2018-04-17 03:21:03 Let them make that mistake.  Maybe this time we will take the oil :)
9324 2018-04-17 03:20:48 As a fire fighter we are trained to handle hazardous situations. There are rules to go by on scene. Certain spills demand having safe zones a specific distance. This is beyond atrocious, but hail big oil 
9325 2018-04-17 03:20:43 This is scary stuff
9326 2018-04-17 03:20:30 In longer term accounts, I've been scaling into $XOP in my wife's 401K since Feb. I think upstream producers have lagged $OIL big time and should be higher.  Either that or $OIL should be much lower.   $XOP starting to come out of that 3 month base hopefully revisit 2016 hi's.
9327 2018-04-17 03:20:16 Aside from pipeline debates, I’m afraid that “lower for longer” oil prices and a world that’s moving away from fossil fuels means that we Albertans may not be able to count on the protective bubble in the future. 2/2

9337 2018-04-17 03:19:14 You have no plan to achieve Canada’s Paris agreement commitments; you’re actively engaged in increasing the development of the oil sands; you’re making misleading statements about protecting the environment and economic growth. You’re not credible or to be trusted.

9342 2018-04-17 03:18:51 my face just breaking out for no reason now. All this water and tea tree oil is for naught
9343 2018-04-17 03:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.

9345 2018-04-17 03:18:27 I've seen the analysis of oil production numbers. The pipeline is necessary to meet demand. It will be profitable.
9346 2018-04-17 03:18:23 He'd probably put coolant instead of transmission oil or something
9347 2018-04-17 03:18:13 Canada's RENEWABLE Pacific marine resources and tourism are a NATIONAL TREASURE and should be recognized by OUR PM not pitting one province against another or forwarding the agenda of a particular oil company...ENERGY EAST would create many more jobs ETC. ETC.
9348 2018-04-17 03:18:12 Cetaphil... it’s has a low pH and isn’t abrasive so it cleanses with out damaging the skin barrier which causes your face to produce more oil
9349 2018-04-17 03:17:58 Vitamin E oil?
9350 2018-04-17 03:17:55 I am the only woman in PDX not in an open relationship. I also use toothpaste instead of coconut oil. Total outlier.
9351 2018-04-17 03:17:55 The irony is that d glutons who claimed to have better economic policies depleted d foreign reserve while oil price was up up there

9360 2018-04-17 03:16:39 I'm not tracking the point you're trying to make but, obviously you're reffering to the Lac-Megantic TRAIN full of crude oil de-railing disaster. Note that pipelines are the safest means of transporting petrol products.
Question on Saudi Arabia? Open source search it yourself.
9361 2018-04-17 03:16:35 Never listen to a fake skincare heaux who recommends fragranced moisturizers/sheet masks, or to use coconut oil as a cleanser.

9363 2018-04-17 03:16:30 Think that $gold is going to pay you well.  Also had $oil short going but closed it today.  It can fall more, but timing has been off this year on $oil short swings.  Nailed the short into 4/6 NFP day, but stopped out previously on 3/21 short.
9364 2018-04-17 03:16:22 Fair. But why dont DEMs hold those in the DEM party to same standards. Why do WE the people accept this.  I did NOT VOTE DEM, REP or Trump. I voted for AMERICA Trump was the only candidate that was not the same snake oil.
9365 2018-04-17 03:16:19  Yeah! They look so good, but I used makeup wipes to take off mascara (apparently that's a no-no, even though they had no oil) and it pulled them out. Lol so I have to go get more put on
9366 2018-04-17 03:16:18 Oh so it’s only ok when B.C. does something to restrict flow of oil and gas
9367 2018-04-17 03:16:14 AChinese oil company was involved in the smuggling of a former Somali rebel officer, Colonel Abdikariim Sheikh Muse, to Ethiopia because his organization of (ONLF) was against oil and mineral exploration in Ogaden of the southeastern Ethiopia

9369 2018-04-17 03:15:38 awesome, what for oil do you use, a few days ago i resigned from my job
9370 2018-04-17 03:15:26 When I started as a staffer for the Alberta labour movement in 1995, our average wages were lower than Ontario and BC. The oil sands boom changed all of that. It was like living in a protective bubble. 1/2
9371 2018-04-17 03:15:20 Got my baby's oil changed today & filled his tank 
9372 2018-04-17 03:14:58 I’ll try it. 
Sounds plausible; coconut oil has a high burn temp...
9373 2018-04-17 03:14:55 Louisiana Offshore Oil Port can load 2 million barrels on a Very Large Crude Carrier for China Market. Port of Vancouver can only handle Aframax Carrier, which is only 550,000 barrels.

#KinderMorgan and export of diluted bitumen is an economic dud in this context.

9379 2018-04-17 03:13:36 Yup so rude !! I went to go fill up my oil and they never even fill it up and they let me take my car and everything!! 
9380 2018-04-17 03:13:33 Yes, it looks like the US military, under Deep State control, are setting up new illegal bases in Eastern Srtia's oil fields.
Russia and Syria are not happy.

9382 2018-04-17 03:13:29 Don't forget we have yet to see how much money the oil companies will very likely have to contribute as a result of recent lawsuit challenges. Compensation for the fact they knew how much their business would add to #climatechange . 4% in the case of Shell .

9385 2018-04-17 03:13:03 Probably have 100years of oil use. The IEA predicts global hydrocarbon usage in the next 25 years will increase, not decrease.  Canada has most environmentally/socially responsible industry on planet. If we don’t supply it, someone less responsible will.

9395 2018-04-17 03:11:57 The $$ lost on the excessive negative price differential for 2 million bbls/day of exported CDN landlocked oil plus the cost of importing some 1 million barrels a day of foreign crude, costs Canada about $35 USD billion/yr.  It's our national character, to suffer leftist idiots
9396 2018-04-17 03:11:47 Very similar to the book "Ill Wind" by Doug Beason & Kevin Anderson, except those enzymes ate an oil spill. Spoiler alert: it doesn't go well.

9427 2018-04-17 03:08:33 sis, mix together brown sugar and coconut oil and rub it on your razor bumps when you take a bath/shower. it makes you smell like a sticky bun, makes your legs shiny and moisturized, helps release ingrown hairs, and since it's not a chemical scrub it doesn't make it worse
9428 2018-04-17 03:08:28 I hope you will be so dilligent as to end oil imports coming in via BC coastlines as well.......
9429 2018-04-17 03:08:24 Excellent. Now you can get back to watching Trump defeat the Military & Oil Industrial Complex by bombing syria. Oh, hey. crude rose almost 1% today to its highest level in 4 years. what dumb luck middle east instability brings the oil companies.

9435 2018-04-17 03:07:41 So Alberta is telling BC they can't limit oil supplies by limiting oil supplies? Exactly how are they going to oppose BC in the courts by doing what BC is doing? That's hardly thinking ahead, is it?
9436 2018-04-17 03:07:38 With the exception of John Kelly, no one that 45 has appointed in their perspective positions have been qualified for the job. If he had a cyber-security chief, bet it was a former banker or oil tycoon.

9438 2018-04-17 03:07:28 Do not arrive by car, bus or airplane. Too much #CO2. #EBikes or walking to #Kamloops preferred.

The irony is of course that Kamloops is along the #KMPipeline route which ships much needed oil for cars, buses or airplanes to #Vancouver.

#CosmicCoincidence ?
9439 2018-04-17 03:07:13 I'm 100% aware she wasn't in power, her and other members of the current gov. actively protested pipelines, do you think that helped get them approved. she railed against the fmr gov. reliance on oil because of boom and bust, but currently is relying on a line not even built yet

9444 2018-04-17 03:06:17 Notley is all hat and no cattle. Gets a law passed that she doesn’t have any intention of using. The law should be amended to state that the taps are turned off on April 25 and turned back on when oil starts flowing on KM line. That is the only thing that will get attention.
9445 2018-04-17 03:05:53 Honestly both THC and coconut oil seem to solve most problems. Like I bet if we combined the two together the right way we could like cure diseases.
9446 2018-04-17 03:05:49 I was in the shower and my BLIND ASS saw this big black spot on my leg and I thought it was a bruise but it was actually just oil paint I’m stressed
9447 2018-04-17 03:05:26 Yeah, there's a whole section in my book on the role the elders have. The woman quoted in the story was almost certainly in the room when I witnessed a Dene elders' meeting with an oil sands co.

9455 2018-04-17 03:04:49 When washing your face, use warm water ? if the water is too hot, you risk washing away too much oil and drying out your skin.

9458 2018-04-17 03:04:13 I haven’t baked in a really long time but today I made an orange olive oil cake with vanilla buttercream and it was great, though it is hideous looking bc I didn’t wait long enough for it to cool before dumping it out of the pan ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
9459 2018-04-17 03:03:19 Lls come on these are facts the bombings of black communities, the failed eradication of the native Americans, the wars waged over oil, etc.etc. We could go on and on
9460 2018-04-17 03:03:10 This is what the war is really about. The rights to the vast reserves of oil in the Golan Heights Israel sold to Genie Oil. It had to come to this. Now a renegotiation with Iran for a new deal which includes #Syria awarding these right to #Israel.

9480 2018-04-17 03:00:31 I hope president #46 sanctions the fuck outta Russia. Banish their oligarchs. Seize all Russian assets in US banks. Don't buy their oil. Don't buy their vodka......and put a hit out on Putin. There. That's all.

9491 2018-04-17 02:59:09 What’s next? The military uses; knives, vehicles, lasers, fuel, oil, aircraft, robotics, and many other items as, or in, weapons of war. A large amount of what we use daily came from the military or NASA.
9492 2018-04-17 02:59:01 ALL these DUMB people thought the ‘oil money’ and huge purchasing wallet to buy players can win you title! *Duh*!! @$%#!! You just need ONE coach to carry a ‘winning heart’ in him. It’s what you carry in you that makes the difference! And that’s Pep! #Mancity #EPL
9493 2018-04-17 02:58:59 Canada is getting ready for an oil embargo on who?... Itself! Haha
9494 2018-04-17 02:58:53 I may need to actually check the case law. Darn. 

I *think* subparagraph (II) includes refining of oil, etc., but does not include petrochemicals. Similarly, 2x4s are included under (iii) but not furniture.
9495 2018-04-17 02:58:34 Hi girls! Sorry menyelit! I’ve always thought oil cleanser is also one of the basic routines sebab.. well, it’s cleansing right? And my skincare routine is very basic. It helps to clear my breakouts a lot. Maybe you girls can try on oil cleanser w/o mineral oil. Good luck!

9500 2018-04-17 02:57:54 He couldn’t fix a flat tire. Total waste of money him even being there. I don’t think Alberta should be allowed to do that . Oil is a natural resource of Canada. They just happened to be the lucky province to have it and have benefitted for years as a result.
9501 2018-04-17 02:57:45 Ok, what inventions exist that can replace oil combustion engines?

9511 2018-04-17 02:55:39 Gazette Poll: Alberta is threatening to reduce oil shipments, to make BC to move forward with #KinderMorgan.  Would such a move make you more or less likely to accept the new #TransMountainPipeline.

9521 2018-04-17 02:53:14 The US is an oil exporter. It just so happens that the Euphrates is a distinguishable border that can be used to prevent genocide of Syrian Kurds.

9532 2018-04-17 02:51:08 Great then bc doesn’t need our oil. Alberta does give equalization payments to Quebec.
9533 2018-04-17 02:51:05 Unlike the oil field I can move my ass around yalls job is limited, and I don’t wanna throw any numbers around but believe it or not hair dresses make around or more then some of y’all black gold men, Varys amongst clientele and the place you work at
9534 2018-04-17 02:50:53 That is rich coming from an organization heavily funded by US interests whose goal is to land lock Canadian oil.  BTW - Kinder Morgan Canada is 70% Canadian owned .... details, details...
9535 2018-04-17 02:50:50 See the win like its right now. No we will not kill anymore innocent lives for gold diamonds or dirty oil. Yes we forgive you. The world run by evil and eye covered sinners.
9536 2018-04-17 02:50:41 The dilbit is not what he is worried about. He is looking at shipping oil.
9537 2018-04-17 02:50:33 of course CBC pulled out Hibernia file, where Mulroney had to fix Trudeaus oil and gas mess in the 80's
9538 2018-04-17 02:49:58 I would say that the media's war against Tesla is unhinged at this point. UAW and Big Oil are swinging for the fences.

9541 2018-04-17 02:49:28 Put them in the oven and throw some olive oil and old bay on them  kale chips are the best! I do the same with spinach!
9542 2018-04-17 02:49:26 hmm I suppose I can understand now. it is kinda mushy??? but if u put olive oil, salt n pepper on it.. shits so good
9543 2018-04-17 02:49:25 Hey. Don’t eat beef. Don’t eat anything with palm oil unless it’s sustainably farmed. Chill out with the micro beads. Use reusable bags. Recycle. Thanks. This has been my TED Talk.

9553 2018-04-17 02:48:21 Alberta is willing to cut down on the amount of oil it ships through the current pipeline to BC. Now BC says it will take Alberta to court if they do that. Does BC want oil or not?

9557 2018-04-17 02:47:44 Just FYI, the oil rig in your picture wasn't built in the middle of the ocean. It's a portable jack-up rig that was towed into position and jacked up to stand on the sea bed.
9558 2018-04-17 02:47:39 I’d assume basically the same? Use less oil in either a stir fry or a salad? (Also low carb-ing so that’s what I’d do.)
9559 2018-04-17 02:47:21 I love this new herbal oil I got

9595 2018-04-17 02:41:51 They can. The manage to give oil companies billions in tax breaks and subsidies, if they can find money to do that, they can find money to subsidize renewable energy to make it more affordable. The cost of dealing with be immense if we do not do something NOW
9596 2018-04-17 02:41:49 I'm sure they have an ample supply of peppermint oil, at least.

9603 2018-04-17 02:40:03 The New Technology does not stop owners of Genie oil and gas from wanting to develop it and profit. Those leases don’t become worthless. I never said it would come to the US. It was competing with Russia’s Baltic pipeline to Europe.
9604 2018-04-17 02:39:59 Seriously, if Que/BC extorts on everything else, are they going to let oil pipeline companies off the hook? I believe Canada have forest fires and oil spills not b/c we are clumsy, lazy or climate change.

(Mother Nature is fine, it's those extortionists we have to worry about.)
9605 2018-04-17 02:39:52 Exactly. No one is saying end all oil production tomorrow, just slowly phase it out and in the mean time we import a lot of gas (and some oil) we should be refining for our own consumption, not shipping it out of the country.
9606 2018-04-17 02:39:44 True but I just don’t think the oil field is a smart place to work at for a long term, a lot of people in San Angelo are stuck here because the oil field is gone, also a lot of those people didn’t save or invest in their money
9607 2018-04-17 02:39:41 So a static oil pipeline is bad but hundreds of high speed oil laden rail cars is ok ? Ffs - reason has exited your mind.

9618 2018-04-17 02:38:14 Maybe oil rich neighbors could afford some of the Muslim charity and welcome refugees.  You know close to home, similar culture, languages, food, and religion?
9619 2018-04-17 02:38:08 Wars over oil? It's not like there is a demand / supply imbalance. Why spend trillions to secure something you can get anyway.
9620 2018-04-17 02:38:06 Real question is why the hell are you loading up on olive oil? I'm not judging the hyped up marketable terror of grains (maybe a little) but then you still consume things in excess? Maybe not eating hundreds of wasted calories in oil would help your T2D. Doesn't make sense to me

9624 2018-04-17 02:37:52 No one is coming to save us. 

If Canadians don’t break the U.S. monopoly on our oil, then our dear neighbours will continue to keep us over a barrel. 

If we let it happen, we have no one to blame but ourselves.

9631 2018-04-17 02:36:24 @charlesadler How come we always hear that our high BC gas prices are only due to refineries south of the border doing annual upgrades. So do we buy Canadian oil that's already gone to the US for refining? Huh???

9667 2018-04-17 02:30:28 To be fair, there's a lot of potential money coming from the oil, of course.  Jobs, stakeholder benefits.  But your absolutely right or point out that staggering amount of money being pumped into the 'environmentalist' side.

9685 2018-04-17 02:28:43 Can you reuse the oil? Or u change it every time
9686 2018-04-17 02:28:27 I agree with you, also late spring early May is a good time to do maintenance at production facilities. The big drop in 2016 occurred just after a multi year low in oil prices that probably also caused output to be reduced.

9699 2018-04-17 02:26:47 Olivier&Co. has great olive oil and vinegars. But, of course, expect corresponding priciness.
9700 2018-04-17 02:26:45 So what you're saying is, if we don't take another 300 tankers a year, that the other 30-40,000 ships, thousands of oil/fuel barge movements, 200,000 ferry sailings a year, don't need a response capability. We always knew the BCLiberals we're just Harper Cons.

9706 2018-04-17 02:26:08 Let's remember Alberta and Fed's have ran oil policy. Both are in huge debt so why should we think their ideas are only one that matters. If for national interest lets build refineries and sell retail for a change. We give away too much.

9725 2018-04-17 02:23:37 Now they say us conservative say the rebels did the chemical attack not Assad. Part of the NWO plan to have usa goto war with russia and china. Or its just another gas oil race.

9735 2018-04-17 02:22:50 hey everyone, chef josh here. just wanted to let you know that mise en place is actually bullshit and the correct way to cook is to slice the tip of your thumb off when frantically chopping onions while your garlic and olive oil burn in a too-hot pan on the stove behind you
9736 2018-04-17 02:22:45 There's pretty solid 'polluter pays' laws to force offending companies to pay for clean-up & damages. KM wouldn't have any obligations once out of port b/c it's outside of their control - the obligation is on the company shipping the oil - if they pollute, they pay. #bcpoli

9775 2018-04-17 02:19:43 And the BC coast provides nearly 100,000 jobs a year now. Why put those in peril for a temporary fraction of that from the oil patch?
9776 2018-04-17 02:19:38 Lucas Oil TV isn't bad. $100 a month includes Sprint cars, Late Mods, off road trucks, even some ARCA races.

9795 2018-04-17 02:17:40 12 pack of Redbull, baby oil, chafing creme, 36ct. Of 2oz Tupperware. (Just trying to pay the bills, man). #MySuspiciousShoppingList
9796 2018-04-17 02:17:38 Actually really dislike the taste - personal. Had some & couldn’t taste peanuts- all oil & sugar. That’s what got me to look into it. Must have been low % peanuts. Maybe they’re allowed to have varying nut facts. Why then is % proprietary? In US, would be peanut butter spread.
9797 2018-04-17 02:17:23 I’m surprised BC would sue Alta if the latter turned down the oil & gas tap. Given its stance on Trans Mountain, I’m surprised to learn BC is still using gas.
9798 2018-04-17 02:17:20 I need some advice: what do you tell your roommate when they have a very unhealthy obsession with an oil defuser??
9799 2018-04-17 02:16:57 And BTW, tar sands bitumen once processed is too expensive for domestic markets. That why KinderMorgan wants to the kill the project. World oil prices are not high enough to justify the investment. @JustinTrudeau got sucker-punched by a crooked American
9800 2018-04-17 02:16:48 @JeffMerkley if you really feel this way about trump then why are you letting oil drilling of Oregon's coast?
9801 2018-04-17 02:16:38 Are we still getting our oil from Russia?
9802 2018-04-17 02:16:30 Well of course, with the Canadian oil and gas industry in chaos the U.S can continue to increase its daily output.
9803 2018-04-17 02:16:24 The extra tanker traffic in the ports will affect the resident orca population which is already threatened. Not to mention the irreparable damage an oil spill would cause
9804 2018-04-17 02:16:23 Hint, that word can be found in there and guess what, oil is oil.
9805 2018-04-17 02:16:01 It’s so sad how so many people and families rely on the oil field in West Texas I’ve literally met so much of these people doing hair and I’m just like ummm what are you gonna do in a couple of years when it’s gone  should have gone to school! think about the future!

JMHO.

9811 2018-04-17 02:15:18 That's my belief why the tried to stop Venezuela. Not for the sanctions. But for the global realization that they don't need usd to sell oil barrels..  We are going to see some major changes, it's exciting to be a small cog lol

9816 2018-04-17 02:14:36 The weapon of mass destruction was selling oil without using the petroDollar.
9817 2018-04-17 02:14:36 Sources say that Scott Pruitt began drilling for oil in a passionate wizard, but you were too distracted by Trump's tweets to notice.
9818 2018-04-17 02:14:34 Coconut oil
9819 2018-04-17 02:14:18 The acceptance that people would be worse off was a Brit MSM success. 
The likelihood was people would be far better off. This was a mistake on YES. Oil worth 20b a yr. Not 10 quid and a half eaten Mars Bar. Late to party as should have been 40 years ago but let's be like Norway.

9847 2018-04-17 02:10:35 Except you aren’t doing what is in the best interest of British Columbia’s economy or citizens. I would rather have oil and gas at an affordable price. And Jobs! And the rule of law cannot be ignored without dire consequences for all. @shirleybond #2HeadedMonster

9856 2018-04-17 02:09:58 Didn't realize you were from BC; all good. I grew up fishing sturgeon in the Fraser, salmon from Barkley Sound so know what's at stake
The "someone else will do it" line is as sure for oil as for drugs. Better to not cede to worse producers. That's how you get carfentanil etc.
9857 2018-04-17 02:09:56 Good job Mr April. Using Heart Healthy Canola Oil must make a difference eh. Thanks for the shout out.

9860 2018-04-17 02:09:06 Great chat bud.. Thanks for your Insight.  Topic for another day... What if OPEC seeing the success of the Venezuelan petro coin.. Decides to no longer base all oil purchases in usd, and creates their own OPEC coin. Removing the only thing left giving the USD and validation.
9861 2018-04-17 02:09:06 Why @sabreeloves just sprinkle some holy oil on me in the library

9869 2018-04-17 02:08:01 The oil was set kn fire again during operation iraqi freedom by Saddam s rear guard army hence making it impossible to secure oils cause this was his same strategy during the first and 2nd gulf war. Yes i disregarded this knowledge in my comment and wasnt expecting negative

9879 2018-04-17 02:07:38 Hmm. Seems similar to opening up oil and gas off coasts, then sparing Florida and Mar-a-Lago. Couldn't be, could it?

Or the countless years you broke skulls and spirits to intimidate workers to stop them from organizing? I do, and we here do not want your history near.

9892 2018-04-17 02:06:07 I told my mom I treated myself today and she replied “Oh to a nice pedicure?”

No this isn’t some kind of fantasy land, I got brakes, rotors, an oil change & ordered tires. I’m a grown-up now, Nanc.
9893 2018-04-17 02:05:51 Pssst, @IdellaMithlynnd, was it the fries of the golden arches that you were discussing that has The Beefness in them? Because I've been avoiding them after I found out they are fried once in a combo oil/beef fat mix at the factory, then again with normal oil at the restaurant.
9894 2018-04-17 02:05:47 This pipeline needs to die. Alberta is now talking about cutting off our oil supply. What can BC do to retaliate? Block Alberta tankers?

Our environment is our economy and way of life. Very important to save it.

9920 2018-04-17 02:03:36 I never thought of that.  One of the largest oil spills in western cda history happened on our land I think It was in the 60's.  They did virtually nothing to clean it up back then you would never even know it happened. In fact I just found out about it last year

9929 2018-04-17 02:01:46 No im disregarding the oil issue i know about that. But their was weapons of mass destruction Iraq that the USAAF. Knocked out and destroyed during operation iraqi freedom.

Even if it was about oil lets not disregard weapon of mass destruction was found in iraq.

9952 2018-04-17 01:59:22 Maybe BC will cut off all oil shipments in response.
9953 2018-04-17 01:59:16 @VassyKapelos Just out of curiosity, what is the difference between Alberta saying it's going to limit oil sent to BC, and BC saying it's going to limit oil in a pipeline from Alta? If Alta has the constitutional right to do so, then why doesn't BC? Or am I just a confused guy?

9958 2018-04-17 01:58:36 I found this podcast very interesting. $10,000/yr/0.25ac is quite lucrative.  I farm around oil wells that take up 4ac and pay $3,000/yr. Sounds like I should be asking for a better deal.
9959 2018-04-17 01:58:36 it's not. The ream aim is to gain Pro-US governments that will install pipelines from Saudi Arabia, through Syria, through Turkey into Europe. Thereby cutting off an essential and vital income for Russia. Russia makes A LOT of money selling oil into Europe.
9960 2018-04-17 01:58:28 Was pretty sad to see streaks of oil in the Gulf of Mexico during the flight over :(

9966 2018-04-17 01:57:57 I'm happy to hear that. I hope it makes it better. I used to get really bad migraines and now I started taking cbd oil for it and I hardly feel it anymore. Have you heard of it before?
9967 2018-04-17 01:57:46 I'm told by some of the best geologists in Australia that NT could have enough gas to serve Australia for almost 200 years. There could be oil too which would help our national security. It is hard to get a geologist excited but they are excited about this!
9968 2018-04-17 01:57:45 Oil and gas industry can easily afford to pay more in taxes and fees. Easily.
9969 2018-04-17 01:57:41 Sometimes you gotta grab the real natural for the real hair growth. Avocados, Coconut Oil, Castor Oil, Mayonnaise, Shea Butter.
9970 2018-04-17 01:57:31 Mr. Sohi, thank you for your reply. I did as you asked and I do not disagree with anything the PM said. Where is the timeline on this being accomplished?  Alberta will turn off the oil. BC will take AB to court. We have a constitutional crisis on our hands.
9971 2018-04-17 01:57:29 The Delta tunnels are sucking the oxygen out of planning agencies. FYI— new intakes for Delta tunnels will be under salt water before project is paid off, but tunnels are more important stopping oil economy in CA.
9972 2018-04-17 01:57:22 Here’s how: Require activists & their funders to retract their false, defamatory info about Alberta oil. If they wont retract, SUE. That would expose the baselessness of Horgan’s stance, enable Canadians to finally understand what is really going on & restore investor confidence.
9973 2018-04-17 01:57:18 If you’re gonna blame Obama for VA issues, can we blame Trump for every inept and corrupt appointee? Want to talk about the $40,000 phone booth for Pruitt? And rolling back protections for clean water in lieu of profits? Or trump hiding his oil investments & pipeline approvals?
9974 2018-04-17 01:57:18 Maybe put a cap full of olive oil in his food?
9975 2018-04-17 01:57:16 @EPAScottPruitt Why do need a private phone? Easier to talk to oil and gas executives. What other possible reason? @MaddowBlog
9976 2018-04-17 01:57:15 For potential foreign purchasers of oil, the key question is how much it will cost to extract the dirty chemical compounds in bitumen so the quality is on par with oil being produced at high-grade, low-cost shale formations like the Bakken, Permian, and Eagle Ford in the US.

9979 2018-04-17 01:57:05 I’m with John Horgan. We must hang on to the natural beauty of B.C. Giving free reign to Big Oil out of Texas a license to kill is not my idea of leadership. BCLibs would give it away for next to nothing in return. #Pipelines #JustinTrudeau
9980 2018-04-17 01:56:45 Oil formation is unrelated to asteroid hits or extinction events, and not all biomass becomes oil.
9981 2018-04-17 01:56:44 ほんとそれです
9982 2018-04-17 01:56:35 it's an informative thing about the keystone oil spill in South Dakota
9983 2018-04-17 01:56:33 Yes. It will be up to consumers to push for it to be used for recycling or they will just keep using oil to make virgin plastic because it is so darned cheap.

9985 2018-04-17 01:56:25 The premium on rail transport is real. The discount is real. As for market, even @ElizabethMay admitted AB oil is in demand.
Educate yourself.
9986 2018-04-17 01:56:17 You really are a  don't believe the fake news! Isis get there money from looting places like Iraq Syria oil
Also they extorted $989million in 2014 to 2015 you really think they need a few dollars from the Saudi's
They were rich from the start! places like iraq and syria = isis
9987 2018-04-17 01:56:12 Avocado  Oil Mayo is SO good!
9988 2018-04-17 01:56:05 If I wasnt married and happily settled down, I'd have tried my hand at roughnecking in the oil fields, driving trucks or pouring concrete. 

The wanderlust comes out now and again, but thats a younger mans game now.
9989 2018-04-17 01:56:04 I’m tired of buying “matte” “all day wear” “oil control” foundations that slide off of my face by 1pm 
9990 2018-04-17 01:55:56 That's because the reason is she's covered in tanning oil, silly lifeguard persona, she's too slippery to hold onto!
9991 2018-04-17 01:55:51 Beard oils containing unrefined jojoba and pure argan oil help to thicken hair and make it easier to style as well.
9992 2018-04-17 01:55:44 I had to buy some new tires, and pay my rent, and on top of that I need to get my oil changed

Two New OilRefineries Planned for Texas: The Biggest in 40 Years 2017. New Asia refineries point to increased sources of petroleum
9995 2018-04-17 01:55:26 Bahahahaha! Nice catch. Hope it wasn't transport for a CBD oil company
9996 2018-04-17 01:55:13 Syria is protected under international law. The Syrian people decide their own leaders as do every other country..if ppl want their oil, pay the Syrians for it. All who fund arm rebels are criminals, bring charges to all involved. Arrest patent holders for public liability.
9997 2018-04-17 01:55:08 My face could genuinely solve the oil crisis
9998 2018-04-17 01:55:05 You are correct that currently we produce more heavy,  but, the forecast seems to be our tight oil production including crude, condensates & nat gas liquids (NGLs) to rise to 13m b/d by 2025, out of total US output of 16.9m b/d.

10001 2018-04-17 01:54:34 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.

10003 2018-04-17 01:54:26 Agreed.  The Russians will definitely attack if we try to cut off their oil pipeline running through Syria.
US needs to stay away from Syria, very dangerous situation!
10004 2018-04-17 01:54:23 @630CHED @charlesadler I'm a bit curious, BC wants to limit bitumen, Alberta wants to limit oil. It's a bit confusing.
10005 2018-04-17 01:54:15 I'm sure grease or oil would work much better
10006 2018-04-17 01:53:52 With low cross-asset correlations, increasing inflationary risks, a positive carry and the potential for oil supply disruptions in the Middle East, the strategic case for owning commodities has rarely been stronger,” the Goldman analysts wrote in their report.
10007 2018-04-17 01:53:51 there is no way that the people will let kinder and morgan make billions more of exporting our oil they made 280 billion last year of discounted oil  at least this way all that money will stay in canada  @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley @MichelleRempel
10008 2018-04-17 01:53:37 @BillNye curious as we move to renewable energy, batteries or energy storage is key, is mining for these metals just as bad as mining for fossil fuels, coal and oil, are these metals more rare for batteries than fossil fuel?
10009 2018-04-17 01:53:37 Concrete measures like investing in green energy and energy efficiency retrofits instead of a Texas corporation's oil pipeline?
10010 2018-04-17 01:53:36 @LeSelNashville quick question. Can you accommodate a soy allergy? Soy bean oil specifically.
10011 2018-04-17 01:53:28 BC's oil and gas come from a refinery across the USA border. Does Notley control that?
