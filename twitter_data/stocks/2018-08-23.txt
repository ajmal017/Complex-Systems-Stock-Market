40 2018-08-23 23:36:45 Good, maybe they'll sell off their stocks so I can get them cheap
41 2018-08-23 23:36:45 Invest that 32.89 in to natty light beer company the week before school starts, stocks will double the following week then sell, and repeat

43 2018-08-23 23:36:11 "with a combination of cash, stocks, and bonus options I am making over minimum wage!"

44 2018-08-23 23:33:36 Dumbasses think that’s a deterrent? Most of us are poor without stocks!
45 2018-08-23 23:33:09 Its funny that Analysts are still taken serious, when most of them have a terrible track record. The success rate isn't even disclosed or seem to play a role in the decision who gets to talk to press and make the stocks move.
46 2018-08-23 23:32:09 I think the stock market would soar on international stocks soaring
47 2018-08-23 23:31:13 It might seem boring to most but I enjoy looking at stocks. Literally any of them I'd take a seat and look through the history of them. Might be wierd but it's what I like to do. On and off the job.!
48 2018-08-23 23:30:35 I usually don’t invest in stocks of more than 20bn . I prefer 1-10bn companies . $NOW is 32bn , not for me .
49 2018-08-23 23:30:31 Same. I need to invent something, get rich, and just make my money at home while my stocks go up.

51 2018-08-23 23:28:06 I though turn private is the better way for Tesla. Wallstreet only wants to know how much money they wil put in their pockets each quarter. So look at #Facebook stocks last month. Wallstreet hungry for money there's no limits.
52 2018-08-23 23:27:23 Dear Rudy and Donald: Here's what would happen if Trump is impeached:  Stocks would soar. People would be out dancing in the streets.  Americans would throw a party the likes of which you've never seen.
53 2018-08-23 23:26:44 Didn’t Donald Trump say he loaded up on stocks after 9/11? So, I am pretty cool with doing bargain hunting on stocks after his impeachment @CNN @realDonaldTrump @DonLemon_CNN
54 2018-08-23 23:26:39 After year one of Trump, U.S. stock returns bested the historic average, but lagged behind Obama’s first year gains significantly!   International stocks were also far less than under Obama.                                            BOOM. Drop the mic Obama.

56 2018-08-23 23:25:03 We don’t get the stocks unless we work for two years and both it and our benefits eat out of our minimum, double taxed wages lol
57 2018-08-23 23:24:33 The pattern is clear in any market, fancies stocks may become expensive but lose the value quickly over time and fundamentally strong ones become more and more expensive even if they look expensive to begin with.
58 2018-08-23 23:24:18 What trump doesn’t want people to know that we have a “false” stock market now. Corporate buy backs have actually raised the value of stocks but this has absolutely no impact on the majority of Americans.
59 2018-08-23 23:23:08 I’m thinking tomorrow will see an opening gain up to .10 level. .10 could be strong resistance. People don’t like holding stocks over weekends. Watch for run up to .10 then sell off to support at .065-.060 range. I’m buying on the dip and playing the bounce...

63 2018-08-23 23:20:20 Andy Borowitz
Even if Trump is right that his impeachment would make stocks crash, the boost the economy would receive by people drinking and shooting off fireworks for a full year would more than make up for it.
64 2018-08-23 23:18:49 It's called spoofing and agree see it all the time. Often see it when stocks get extended too
65 2018-08-23 23:18:10 So you think you have the right to demand that I participate in what you deem as compassionate and be looted by government?

I dare you to say "yes".
66 2018-08-23 23:16:39 I do have a concern. Many companies are taking their windfall from trump & buying their own stocks. This could end up badly.
67 2018-08-23 23:14:20 what's quicker? Asking you to find a book which takes 5 to 10 minutes or having an AI Simulacrum find it in 3 seconds flat and guide me? Added benefit? Multiple AI's can be summoned by users at any time whereas humans..not so much.
68 2018-08-23 23:13:23 Rhetorical question? Of course there are people out there who believe it. Especially the 1% who own the most stocks and are benefiting the most from a DJT presidency.
69 2018-08-23 23:12:58 The strong dollar has caused international stocks to underperform US stocks this year.  With the Fed going to raise interest rates further, expect this trend to continue.
70 2018-08-23 23:12:50 I already got self-driving trucks deployed in Afghanistan. Other robotic devices from mules to transport are being tested and deployed. Government jobs tend to be archaic and outdated and riddle with paperwork. AI replaces it all. If I need a librarian..
71 2018-08-23 23:12:24 Imagine the Economy If @MSNBC @ABC @NBC @CNN @CBS was on Board to #MAGA! WOW! W/ Trump & MSM We'd Be 30000 pts on the Stocks almost Overnight.
72 2018-08-23 23:11:16 I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be heartless. Fact is Technology isn't going to be stopped now. Robotics and AI is going to do away with a lot of jobs. Why do you think I'm in IT? NetSec to be more specific? I mean look around. We're testing self driving cars.
73 2018-08-23 23:11:07 U have a knack on identifying BOs. How many stocks do u typically have on your radar ?
74 2018-08-23 23:10:14 Turnbull Wins: Continued progression

77 2018-08-23 23:06:38 For sure. "Break-even" is a standard multiple I tend to look at in my Bloomberg terminal every day when analyzing stocks, bonds, or any other financial instrument. How high does this have to go to reach ATH? Real value add fundamental analysis.
78 2018-08-23 23:06:32 Everything has volatility, even long-term U.S. treasury bonds.  Stocks are obviously quite volatile—yet we use it them calculating the net worth of people like Jeff Bezos.
79 2018-08-23 23:06:31 What is going on in your profile pic? It looks like you have just stolen food from a needy child and are greedily eating it, table manners be damned, while checking up on your stocks. More or less accurate?
80 2018-08-23 23:06:23 I would risk it.  Don’t care if our stocks take a dive or disappear.  Just want a little peace and safety in the world.

84 2018-08-23 23:03:52 #Stocks will crash anyhow - as soaring stocks while incomes near-flat (especially of current workers) and many incomes nil (especially of current workers) is a bubble, exactly same pattern housing bubble went.
85 2018-08-23 23:03:50 52% of Americans own stocks.
I don't know the breakdown of how the owners' investments are distributed, but I would bet most have more $ tied up in their homes.

No, I don't want the market to crash, but I wouldn't mind seeing coal mining and weapons manufacturing go bust.

90 2018-08-23 22:59:15 Which Dems introduced and the NRA helped block. You can't claim the NRA wants the ATF to regulate them if the ATF doesn't create laws and the the NRA blocks legislation that would allow the ATF to regulate bump stocks. 

It's like your trying to confuse uninformed people.
91 2018-08-23 22:58:55 It was honestly crazy how much I learned playing! the in-game market with trading, stocks, shops, etc. were a formative playground for me too, and running a guild was a trip as a middle schooler

94 2018-08-23 22:56:58 I had a colleague say "Trump sure seems to be making the stock market go up." I didn't have time, so I just said "That's good if you have stocks." Then we talked about work again.

97 2018-08-23 22:56:02 Slavery doesn't always mean iron and chains. One can place others into economic slavery. And yes, when one claims that taxpayers should be looted by government in the name of "compassion", that's exactly what it is. I dare you to say "no".
98 2018-08-23 22:55:42 The stocks for those who think Westminster polls only poll people in Westminster.
99 2018-08-23 22:53:51 Government begets more government. That's the rule. I could wipe out 30% of the bureaucrats and we wouldn't skip a beat. Be honest, a librarian is outdated. Everything is on Kindle these days. I don't hate you. I just dislike bureaucrats that are unaccountable.
100 2018-08-23 22:52:40 Agreed. These are things like stocks and bonds given to kids or purchased themselves...which sadly isn’t exactly a priority or an option for some folk

Its not too easy to reconsider the tb problem via johanes infection from importing cows into their stocks
And possibly vaccinations rather than blaming a wild badger who is hardly  making any difference to the cows at all
103 2018-08-23 22:50:48 Asking the ATF to review bump stocks is asinine as they already have and determined that that don't violate the law due to the way how specifically the full auto laws are written. It would take new legislation to ban them.
104 2018-08-23 22:50:34 When it comes to stocks, I prefer to ride the young thoroughbreds.  Leave the old mares out in the field to chew grass.  Made that decision long ago and haven’t regretted it.
105 2018-08-23 22:50:06 I deal with fishing and farming, Essex is the county with the biggest coast line and is flat prefect from crop farmers. We get a great deal regarding fishing, but we have cut back to allow fish stocks to grow. Farmers do well from the EU.

114 2018-08-23 22:43:03 This isn't about alchol or cars. Don't make apples to motorcycle comparisons.

There's a reason full autos are essentially illegal, bump stocks only purpose is to replicate the firing rate, in a less controlled fashion. They should be banned.

121 2018-08-23 22:38:19 Weed stocks, smart car sensors, electric car charging stations, were a few niche industries/companies that popped in past 12-18 months...

Gambling companies could see some action eventually.

123 2018-08-23 22:37:21 Increíble que la simple opinión de Delfina Guzmán sea más importante que la manipulación del número de stocks que perdieron la vida y denominados así también por la ex ministra de justicia Javiera Blanco.
124 2018-08-23 22:36:23 It sure makes his day smiling a lot while he stocks shelves.
125 2018-08-23 22:36:16 She's up there for sure.

I like all of it. No foreign lobbying. No private stocks. Mandatory tax return disclosure. Mandatory business divestiture. It's all gravy.
126 2018-08-23 22:36:00 Robinhood is great for ease of use, 24/7 accessibility, and a great all in one shop for trading stocks, options, and cryptocurrencies. Though their charting is subpar and it isn't as "fast" as brokers that charge commission, but you'll save a ton of money not paying those fees.
127 2018-08-23 22:35:54 Kids like the Parkland survivors? Yeah, "signs keep away shooters". Wasn't that an idea the NRA ridiculed for decades? Has that changed? Are signs now an effective deterrent? Hey, how do you feel about bump-stocks?

130 2018-08-23 22:33:40 $nbev AT, Some can't help but bitch. It's their nature. I've been in stocks where it went down, fundamentals changed, I didn't believe in the company anymore. I took my loss & moved on. I didn't lament ongoing. Sick of hearing about BW. Move on it your not happy with him. Simple.
131 2018-08-23 22:31:54 I always suspected that he was still trading stocks, since he said he turned his personal business over to his sons, and they're... well you know... He can manipulate the market with one of his tweets and be buying and selling.

142 2018-08-23 22:28:29 It's called Tithe. I do it at church. Here's the difference. What I do is completely voluntary and thus compassionate. What you demand of me is to be forced to provide more for others while lowering my family's quality of life. That isn't compassion. It's slavery.
143 2018-08-23 22:27:12 Not all shorts are available. Yes, no locate and interest fees. Nobody talks about the availability of stocks to trade.

147 2018-08-23 22:22:25 With so much derision for mining stocks there can’t be many sellers left. When the EM currency problems land on the shores of developed nations it will mark the end this credit tightening cycle and eventually lead to more QE. Got gold??
148 2018-08-23 22:21:02 Heh - yes... lots of ways to “tie” stocks together (and I’m sorry to hear you’ve picked one that is leading to frustration on your part... good luck with the approach though!)

153 2018-08-23 22:20:13 Orange 45 says stocks will go down if he is impeached. Today they went down because of his tariffs. Smoke and mirrors. Look up  GOP! When will you act?
154 2018-08-23 22:20:13 Productivity is to do more with less resources, is to make good sales with the minimum of "tied" money in stocks, is not to lose sales due to lack of stock.
#Productivity #Business #Management #Industry
155 2018-08-23 22:18:37 Ideally, you should keep your stocks at a balanced level, neither too much nor too low, and thereby increase the productivity of your industry.

Oh, and LIBERAL JUDGES that will punish them!
159 2018-08-23 22:16:23 Stocks dipped for the 2nd day in a row on Thursday in another range-bound day of trading on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index inched away from its elusive January 26 record close, ending the session lower by 0.2%, and the Nasdaq and the DJIA lost 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively.
160 2018-08-23 22:16:15 But it isn't quite the same without the gallows, or at least stocks on the APH lawns.

168 2018-08-23 22:11:20 History repeats itself. We have just passed the levels of real estate that we had in 2007, right before the 2008 great recession, only this time no amount of band-aids are going recover us. Last time the housing crisis dealt a major blow. This time stocks and debts will crush us.

171 2018-08-23 22:10:02 Stocks are cheap for a reason. The whole market consisting of accountants, hedge funds, individuals have gone over every aspect and priced it out. The market already is aware and prices it as such. Would you eat old sushi?

175 2018-08-23 22:07:42 super duper excited for junior yr!!!
176 2018-08-23 22:06:11  Stocks or shares are just pieces of a business. And there are great Real Estate opportunities on the stock market, such as Merlin Properties (Madrid).
177 2018-08-23 22:05:48 fuck your zodiac sign are you buying tech stocks

179 2018-08-23 22:03:17 Trump has done more in this short time then that clown Nobama did in 8 years. Who can do nothing but double the debt of all pasts and nothing to show? Stocks up since 8 years. Move to Canada  I’ll see ya back soon kissing American soil.
180 2018-08-23 22:02:19 I'm already very poor and I don't have any stocks so I say let's impeach him and see what happens!

183 2018-08-23 22:01:03 You know earnings season in stocks?   A stock could kill when they announce earnings, but the street (smart money, accredited investors, insiders) expected it to kill so the stock dosnt go up a penny.
184 2018-08-23 22:00:55 @realDonaldTrump Everyone is already poor because of you. middle-class and lower-income households would feel little impact from a market downdraft simply because they don't own stocks.

188 2018-08-23 21:58:18 First off, I was talking to the other young lady. I wasn't talking about you. And the bottom 50% of 141M tax filers paid...2.8% tax share. The 50% above group..paid 97.2%. I'm in no mood to make the bottom 50% lives any easier than what it is.
189 2018-08-23 21:57:51 @jimcramer Do you think the President's actions lead to a more volatile market? With the stocks retreating could the be an opportunity to buy?
190 2018-08-23 21:57:17 Charles, if you have two or three safe bet stocks, what would they be? I am not looking for grand slams with risk. Too close to retirement. I currently own Apple and have had Disney for 40 years, and both have been awesome. Double down on those two, or are there a few others?
191 2018-08-23 21:56:06 Rewarding the no skill/low skill isn't the right thing to do. Not by a long shot. Making them work their way up the ladder and prove their worth is the right thing to do. There are winners and there are losers. Guess what the perpetual MW types are? (hint: not winners)

197 2018-08-23 21:54:38 Really? You're a librarian. I work in the real world where economics is a daily thing. You don't run a business, you're not involved in a business. You have no risk, no capital, literally no skin. You're a consumer and that's it. Don't even pretend to think you understand econ.
198 2018-08-23 21:54:35 Bro as long as i can take out one of their stocks I'd feel like i made an impression
199 2018-08-23 21:54:00 I’ve had stocks for 20+ years but only something like 40% of people do. So it’s totally BS when he touts the stock market as being something that matters to most people
200 2018-08-23 21:51:52 That's fine and dandy.
201 2018-08-23 21:51:30 That's code for "Cash in your stocks now peeps, I'm going down!"
202 2018-08-23 21:51:20 You're a government employee on the teat of the taxpayer. You never worked a real private sector job a day in your life.  Need I say more?
203 2018-08-23 21:50:26 An EMT or a jr. bookkeeper starts at $15. A sous chef starts around that. What makes you they want to see some dude that can barely function in life get the same scale as they did?

206 2018-08-23 21:49:10 5) The dark side of me hopes you get the 15/hr. I'm assuming you like the Hunger Games? If you do, then you're going to love the corporate version of it when it's you fighting for 1 to 2 positions with hundreds if not thousands because every company constricted.
207 2018-08-23 21:47:58 Even if Trump is right that his impeachment would make stocks crash, the boost the economy would receive by people drinking and shooting off fireworks for a full year would more than make up for it.
208 2018-08-23 21:47:44 4. Not only will we be faced with higher costs of living, an entire segment of the population (high schoolers) will be effectively locked out of an entry level position.
209 2018-08-23 21:47:25 Is that stocks of meal or beans?
210 2018-08-23 21:47:01 3) You also managed to devalue everyone else on top of that.
211 2018-08-23 21:46:43 2). Everyone currently making $15/hr just had their job devalued by folks like you who think a person deserves for more breathing as opposed to actually working for it.

219 2018-08-23 21:44:19 I was listening to an analysis of Warren's recent proposed changes to corporate management, and one of the criticisms people have made was that it would cause stocks to drop. However, it was mostly because more profits went to employees rather than investors (like in DE or DK).

225 2018-08-23 21:41:49 I have stocks in my retirement accounts but 1) I'll never have enough to be able to retire at this rate, and 2) if we just taxed the fucking rich properly, Social Security would be flush and I wouldn't have to rely on a 401k.
226 2018-08-23 21:41:08 I think training people to see dividends as their real return, which reinvested in a down market buys cheap stocks, would help perception. Percentage returns mean little during early accumulation years.

236 2018-08-23 21:38:24 If I had stocks or benefited at all from tax breaks I would give all of it up to save this country.  It shouldn’t be about our wallets and sadly it is for many.
237 2018-08-23 21:38:10 You might have to try it out for yourself judging by the variance in the replies.  It is super easy to use to place an order for stocks or options.  Probably better suited for use other than day trading.  Really cool to not have any fees.

239 2018-08-23 21:37:03 For those in #Hawaii for #HurricaneLane - if you need water and the usual places are sold out, check office supply stores like Office Depot and Staples.

240 2018-08-23 21:36:26 RM200k is the reasonable amount of capital that can be obtained for people around 30 till 40 years old. 5% return a month from the stock market is a realistic average return based on studies. Trading in stocks only needs 10 hrs a week so time can be spent on other interests.

255 2018-08-23 21:31:19 How to trade stocks
256 2018-08-23 21:31:01 I say prove it! I have no stocks/bonds/securities. My house is still in the hole from 2006/7. I have protection against intruders. Let’s do it.
257 2018-08-23 21:30:43 @CGasparino more questions you can’t answer:
1. Is Tesla high or low right now?
2. What other stocks and/or coins do you like?
3. What’s your favorite hot pocket flavor?
258 2018-08-23 21:30:27 I am with you, since I have no money to buy stocks anyway Maybe if we flip Trump we all will have money to invest
259 2018-08-23 21:29:42 Some people don't believe in God. I don't believe in Stocks. What is a stock? The fuck is it? What does it do? Why does it make money? What are futures? Why are we letting Children sit in offices and print themselves money?
260 2018-08-23 21:28:55 Chinese Internet stocks getting whacked... music to US bull market ears. Shaking out greedy momentum players as AAII/II Bulls are still subdued. Bullish Wall of worry log along with tariffs, Trumpomania, flat yield curve. LT bullish...

263 2018-08-23 21:27:45 We don't want trump out that bad. None of us are missing meals, we have jobs, internet, clothes, stocks are up. When we are desperate enough we will do what the Egyptians and South Koreans did. Can't expect the courts to clean up our lack of action on this corrupt regime.

269 2018-08-23 21:24:01 I am progressive Dem & own stocks. I want liar Trump indicted & removed. I oppose his animus to immigrants, his trade wars. I oppose his dismantling Obamacare, his campaign against clean air & water. @CNBCFastMoney @timseymour @MelissaLeeCNBC

276 2018-08-23 21:21:35 Considering the majority of Americans don't or aren't able to own stocks, yeah, I'm willing to risk it.
277 2018-08-23 21:20:27 Have an account on there and am happy with it. None of the issues some have mentioned. (Of course, I only trade stocks long) Quick trade execution without issues. Saves sooo much in trade fees.

281 2018-08-23 21:19:28 I use it for collecting dividend stocks and that’s about it.  I use fidelity for my trading and research.  It’s good for people with small accounts.  It doesn’t have all the stocks available.  It serves a purpose
282 2018-08-23 21:19:24 Would rather live in a decent cou try with decent leaders than have my stocks increase. This won't last anyway, the lack of regulations will hurt us more and the lack of innovation for clean energy will leave us behind and ubable to compete
283 2018-08-23 21:19:17 Don't play the penny stocks.
284 2018-08-23 21:18:49 If that is true we need someone else. Wall street is going to crash with you or without you. The changes you made and tax breaks. Companies buying back their own stocks. They are artificially raising the stock and as soon as the stocks are worth more than the company. Down we go.
285 2018-08-23 21:17:46 Thanks, we're always getting those two mixed up. Sorta like "first show, then drinks".

What other stocks do you like?

287 2018-08-23 21:16:18 If Trump were impeached the world will once again have the confidence to invest in US stocks , knowing that the country is no longer run by an empty headed buffoon! The stock market would boom!

289 2018-08-23 21:13:17 I’ve been successfully swing trading options for free. You don’t get quite as good fill prices as other brokers such as E*TRADE or fidelity and there are no stop loss or sell limit orders for options but there are for stocks. No conditional orders for either.

291 2018-08-23 21:13:07 I have used Robinhood to trade stocks and options.  It works well and is indeed free.  Only problem I have seen is when trying to buy or sell options it sometimes makes me go up or down to the nearest nickel.

300 2018-08-23 21:07:52 When @realDonaldTrump talks about the stock market crashing, he is talking directly to the wealthiest Americans and the lobbyists that represent them. 10% of the richest Americans own 84% of stocks. Trump again shows he's only worried about the rich.

315 2018-08-23 21:03:06 Ya think? Hey, mr illegitimate president, stocks lost 42% of their value during Watergate. You're going to be responsible for tanking every cabinet member, every appointee & have revoked every stupid conman Executive Order you signed. Markets will tank worse than 08 thanks dick!
316 2018-08-23 21:03:04 Don't you like how Trump, his congressional cohorts and Faux News are always trying to convince you that you're better off, because corporations and the rich are doing better?

375 2018-08-23 20:32:53 Any more questions, just look at the price of the bonds.  Stocks may lie, but bonds never do.  Bonds say BK ahead.  Buh-bye.
376 2018-08-23 20:32:52 I will probably use Robin hood from here on out so I can manage my stocks and crypto together, although I usually use binance and kucoin. I did start on coin base but yeah, fees are outrageous and no way would I pay that on that large of transaction!
377 2018-08-23 20:32:47 Fenders with matching colored head stocks are to die for @Fender
378 2018-08-23 20:32:30 No way, clearly she’s an alien.
379 2018-08-23 20:32:20 I'd normally agree, but I see the hand of God in this one: 80-20 asshole to innocent picking up the tab. Because they aren't expecting the cascading shit storm that will hit their stocks that depend on illegal actions to maintain their value and this illegitimate Coup to make $$
380 2018-08-23 20:32:02 Remember when the economy fell Obama mentioned he was purchasing hundreds of thousands of dollars a month in stocks and bonds to prop up the market? Okay those should be worth lots and lots now whose name are they in and where they at???

382 2018-08-23 20:28:17 Tokenized securities are coming!  They are pegged to financial assets like stocks, bonds and real estate, with the aim of avoiding the volatility seen in cryptocurrencies.

383 2018-08-23 20:27:02 You tRumps are good at taking credit for the work of others!  Daddy inherited booming economy. NOT his doing. Stocks exploding because companies are using tax cuts to buy back stocks. They are NOT giving it to their workers!  Do you know anything about basic economic?
384 2018-08-23 20:23:46 @shopritewines Byram now stocks @ThistlyCross cider, which makes me very happy.  Could ShopRite Byram please stock @EdenMill gin, please?
385 2018-08-23 20:22:15 I seem to recall reading that the L30 Rifled gun that was selected because it was capable of using existing ammunition stocks. Because the thought was that they would make a Challenger 2 Mk.2 that would mount the 140mm FTMA gun that was still being worked on at the time.
386 2018-08-23 20:21:55 Yes, agree, but some way to pick good setup stocks needed from the thousands of others, there must be some method to this madness surely)))
387 2018-08-23 20:20:39 Y - stocks suddenly surging...it's a low-margin biz - I know becuz I was approached about investing $1 million in a growing operation. Didn't look all that attractive to me on the due diligence, but the stocks are moving.
388 2018-08-23 20:20:34 Just looked at a handful of #retail stocks that beat #quarterly #consensus #EPS ests & raised full year guidance.  Most barely raised by amount of qtr beat. Shows lack of confidence by mgt in my view despite what every Wall St. strategist says about better "guidance ratios". $SPX
389 2018-08-23 20:19:44 $SPX frayed nerves from politics displaced onto market, even though many stocks seem to want to go up?
390 2018-08-23 20:18:39 The economy is only strong for rich people with stocks. Its growth under O has slowed under T.
Wages have been stagnant for FAR too long and it is deplorable that conservatives refuse to pass legislation that would pay average workers a liveable wage.
391 2018-08-23 20:18:36 Kevin was   during   stocks .
392 2018-08-23 20:18:19 unbelievable you and your fellow #DemocraticParty’s SocialistView fail to realize your entire party has not said one positive thing in over two years, record low unemployment of minorities, record stocks prices, booming economy, lower taxes, positive economic forecast. #Winning
393 2018-08-23 20:17:07 How does the SEC continue to stain the crypto market w/ the price manipulation argument. Are they in a coma during the daily manipulation of penny stocks; or a Elon Musk tweet, sending Tesla shares soaring. Total BS!!
394 2018-08-23 20:16:44 @ShopRiteLiquorV Byram NJ now stocks @ThistlyCross cider ,which makes me very happy.  Could you possibly also stock @EdenMill gin?  Please?
395 2018-08-23 20:16:13 I love it for stocks and options. I do most of my trading on it. But I have other platforms for a research and for obscure stocks. My only problem is no stops on options.
396 2018-08-23 20:16:08 The markets will crash anyway.He's unbalanced them with tax breaks which companies have used to buy their own stocks, artificially inflate the prices,cue re-adjustment,panic,crash, then governments shift trillions of public money to refloat the banks and impose austerity. #trump
397 2018-08-23 20:16:03 Which is silly, because the black market for guns is predicated on its ability to leech off the legal market. Bump stocks and theoretical concerns about 3d guns aside, all the guns we're talking about were legal at some point in the supply chain

401 2018-08-23 20:15:00 Cool, a buyers market. I'll buy more stocks, ride it back up, and not have to listen to drumphuck.
402 2018-08-23 20:13:20 Stocks finish broadly lower as trade worries return, sapping some big exporters. Once again the mkt just ran out of gas after early rally. Dow ends -76, -0.3% to 25,656. S&P -0.2%, Nasdaq -0.1%, Russell 2000 -0.3%.

Among exporters, $CAT -2.0%, $DE -1.1%, $BA -0.8%.
403 2018-08-23 20:12:39 Options on robinhood isn’t the best wouldn’t recommend for it. For regular stocks it’s okay
404 2018-08-23 20:12:13 And quite frankly I don't give a damn if the Stock market reacts to Trumps Impeachment . Stocks can recover just like they did in the last meltdown . What we can't recover from is if we keep a Criminal as President . The world would nosee how we treat the Word of Law in The USA .
405 2018-08-23 20:11:28 World stocks generally slightly lower: US & Europe -.2%. Additional tariffs went into effect while US - China negotiations starting. Market should be fine until tariffs hit profits and GDP growth. But uncertainty will cause occasional volatility spikes. Mild optimism still fine.
406 2018-08-23 20:11:24 The #bullmarket in US stocks turned 3453 days old on Wednesday.... the longest in history. With that said, its a pretty expensive one too.
407 2018-08-23 20:11:20 Took awhile for me to get. follow satoshi flipper and read nik Patel alt coin trader if you are not. Use the alts to roll more btc. When they top jump out to btc or btc to tether. Don’t fall in luv with your alts they are not stocks and you can always find new ones. Btc is king

409 2018-08-23 20:10:55 Trade penny stocks while in the toilet, driving, etc.

If I want to do serious trading, I sit down, do research, check charts, numbers, etc.
410 2018-08-23 20:10:54 You cannot daytrade options with less than 25k in your account. 
You can have a cash account, but you cannot trade options with your cash account, only stocks.

419 2018-08-23 20:07:02 For stocks it's okay. Stay away from the options though. You can't set stop losses and fill times are sluggish. Day trading is limited, even on a cash account. 

I started with Robinhood but moved on to a "real" trading platform.
420 2018-08-23 20:06:25 @TheTigerGin is there any where in Glasgow that stocks your Gin as I would like to try it and so far can't find it
421 2018-08-23 20:06:21 Hi there -- we won't offer OTC at launch but will support over 8,000 publicly-traded common stocks and ETFs listed on major Canadian and U.S. exchanges. Thanks for your question!
422 2018-08-23 20:06:01 I by no means am arguing in favour of real estate agents or their fees.  merely pointing out that you have nothing to do with stocks going up yet charge a fee for buying stock in TD etc
423 2018-08-23 20:05:04 This is your Queeeennn @NICKIMINAJ #QueenRadio The stocks on Apple went up 
424 2018-08-23 20:04:41 WTF1 and F1 (in it's current state) are both laughing stocks in their own right
425 2018-08-23 20:04:26 I'm guessing it's inflation too (i.e. net real return is higher in lower example (!)). 

It's so a good example why illustrations are both (a) arguably pointless and (b) dangerous in that they can both over promise OR under illustrate and put people off.
426 2018-08-23 20:04:12 Have a good evening folks
427 2018-08-23 20:03:57 Few stocks holding up the market and that’s supposed to be positive? I’m calling DOW double top.

433 2018-08-23 20:01:52 You see those dips entering the end of 2017? Also look at stocks the day after election. It's fact Obama economy was headed to recession
434 2018-08-23 20:01:48 Complex source... See its folks who got stocks overseas and invest against the Rand... Keep international reporters overseas on the payroll, spread some weird propaganda and then watch the Rand take a knock, bank big bucks off the small decline.
435 2018-08-23 20:01:47 The market will not crash. People would buy stocks, the whole world would rejoice.
436 2018-08-23 20:01:24 We find many providers / administrators require annual resubmission even though our authority says it is valid until otherwise.

A real issue when dealing with DB schemes / legacy schemes and a waste of everyone's time.
437 2018-08-23 20:01:17 To be a good investor, you should get involved in the market, do not just rely on hear say. I listened to Brokers a bit, got my fingers burnt and learnt my lessons. I then started choosing my stocks, read the financial reports of companies. It was interesting and thrilling.

494 2018-08-23 19:32:42 The market which is manipulated by a few.  Companies are buying back their own stocks instead of investing back in their employees. You can win in Wall Street because it’s rigged for the rich.  They can gamble your savings away w no penalties.
495 2018-08-23 19:32:26 when you spend so much time thinking, learning, studying, and trading stocks that you find yourself spelling "apple' as "AAPL" instead of "apple" in everyday stuff. you know its real..

500 2018-08-23 19:30:11 Breakdown: There are enough Wall St. accounts for 50% of the population,  In reality, because rich people have accounts in every financial firm available to them, only 10% of the population actually hold stocks and bonds. and therefore only 10% profit.

504 2018-08-23 19:28:29 To which, that reasonable assumption has earned a block. Plenty to say on other stocks, yet #ASO falls a third and has no comment. Sure we'll hear more off him when he's rebought and wants his next run higher. Maybe I'll get an unblock then.

511 2018-08-23 19:22:42 Stories like this make me wish we could put these perps in stocks in the town/city center for a few days before their jail term.  She's a disgrace.  #ByeBye
512 2018-08-23 19:22:01 Here are a few *good* ideas on how to make our schools safer:
 
Make background checks universal & ensure data is getting into the system
Ban military-style assault weapons
Ban bump stocks
Ban high capacity magazines
Raise the minimum age to purchase rifles

535 2018-08-23 19:09:37 What if trump made a deal with Barron's? 

He says that stocks will crash if he gets impeached and then when he gets impeached the market goes up another 1000%.
536 2018-08-23 19:09:18 #I’mNotScared #LetsTestThatTheory Does he think everyone owns stocks or investments? So many people living paycheck to paycheck. I think we’ll bounce back just fine.
537 2018-08-23 19:08:31 Rants of a 1%er (at least someone who caters to the 1%): "If I'm impeached, stocks would tank, everyone would be poor" @realDonaldTrump in a softball @FoxNews interview. Because the average citizen owns a hedge fund? Most WORK, and are not immersed in markets. How out of touch!

Large "stocks" of all animals are almost always more resilient than small stocks for many reasons including:

- widespread distribution in time and space

Escapement objectives might be useful but establishment thereof will require a lot of research.

639 2018-08-23 18:26:45 Its a lot about lens and film guage.  Shoot 16mm on a bolex, or reversal super 8mm (super 8mm is the greatest cheapest way to trick production budget on earth).  Also ditch filter correction and shoot tungsten stocks in daylight then correct in post to where you want.
640 2018-08-23 18:26:30 Stocks. Definitely undervalued.

642 2018-08-23 18:26:10 Everyone gets so emotional over these micro cap stocks it's bat-shit insane. 

The exchange on which it changes is irrelevant. 

Sure sector is down, all base metals. But your avg investor here bought because of others. You did your due diligence so ignore the tweet.
643 2018-08-23 18:25:55 I love this thread, but  most blacks don't want to invest in stocks because they don't know how, they think it's for the "rich" and we don't like the term delayed gratification. We gotta have everything right away, instead of gaining wealthy slowly, we rather get "rich" quick

646 2018-08-23 18:23:05 While we do need to look for fundamentals determining the right entry points is also key. There is now a clear 4 year market cycle driven by presidential elections. Superimpose on that oil price movements and Naira/$ valuation. These affect all stocks no matter the fundamentals.
647 2018-08-23 18:22:32 TWN Stocks:  Quietly, and deservedly, Nantex (2108 南帝) stock has risen 50% in 6 months.  Investors are finally waking up to the fact that this fucker is for real.   Stock just recently broke out of a 24-year downtrend and oughta continue to trend upwards.
648 2018-08-23 18:22:29 I'm willing to take the chance. The bubble is going to burst on the market anyway when the Fortune 500's dump all their own stocks and walk away with an obscene amount of money and the leave the rest of us destitute. We've seen this story before. Cut to the chase already.
649 2018-08-23 18:22:20 Got home from the hospital yesterday with a healthy baby boy and wife.  Was an experience, I wont get into.  But during the heightened emotions going on, made sure to make no moves in stocks, didn't really have time either. Also lucky that the market was on the up swing lol.

659 2018-08-23 18:15:41 I must say, the best part about these early exploration stocks in the mining sector is that when speculators want to short gold via $GDX $GDXJ, they aren't affected. Those ETFs do more damage to the sector than anything else.
660 2018-08-23 18:15:20 Penny traders trade scammy stocks for a living and yet some are only finding out now that Trump is a complete fraud. Only took them, what, 2 years?   :)

664 2018-08-23 18:14:14 Honestly, I do not. There are plenty of stocks that could potentially fit that description, but none that stand out to me at the moment as having clear home run potential without appropriately significant risk. In a nutshell, stocks are expensive these days. Good luck!

671 2018-08-23 18:10:47 It is an exciting time in the cannabis investing space.  My simple thesis is that as more countries and US states legalize it, these stocks should do well.  Of course, our state will be among the last to consider legalization.  Sad!

720 2018-08-23 17:46:53 Why are largest BC sockeye stocks more resilient? Maybe because the Pacific Salmon Commission aims to meet escapement objectives for those pops.

727 2018-08-23 17:43:41 Sell #stocks which shows you no profit or reversal sharp. Clean your portfolio regularly and put that money into your winners. But average up step by step and don't increase your risk too quick.

772 2018-08-23 17:19:13 She's only required to report a range. Her total 2017 portfolio was worth up to $3.45m of which tech stocks were worth up to $1.095m. In 2014, her portfolio was worth up to $2.2 m. Tech stocks were only $47,000. Big difference. No insider deals, but still a conflict of interest.
773 2018-08-23 17:19:11 The NRA opposed a ban on bump stocks. Why?!

What reason do you need for something that replicates full auto firing speed that is less controllable?
774 2018-08-23 17:18:39 tRump might be telling the truth when it comes to the economy, who would guess that? We're riding a delusional uptide on the housing, stocks, funds etc. markets, with no backup in manufacturing, GNP, etc.  Worrying me.
775 2018-08-23 17:16:47 Yeah I do know and I know you're already misleading framing it. 

The ATF Dept under Obama said that bump stocks are legal due to the way the full auto law was written. Trump said he would look into it but that was almost a year ago with no action. 

Fuck off tool.

787 2018-08-23 17:12:17 I certainly will. But without sounding pretentious, the look and "feel" of today's film stocks has quite a warm, 'thermal-like' texture to them. If I wanted to, could I emulate the same crisp, raw aesthetic of the mid-to-late 80's stocks - today?
788 2018-08-23 17:11:47 A lot of people don't understand there will be a time to gather back the money that Trump gave the filthy rich and the corporations which use the money to buy back stocks by the hundreds of billions. When the EPA is put back together there goes some of your dirty jobs

798 2018-08-23 17:09:00 The market is going to do what it will do.  These tariffs are already hurting people.  Removing him and ALL the treasonous GOP will only strengthen America.  Besides, how many people actually own stocks in the middle class?  Most are foreign countries that own stock in US

810 2018-08-23 17:05:08 You think Obama has anything to do with the stock market success of the past year ?  You know nothing about how Wall Street works. Stocks go up and down on a daily basis.

811 2018-08-23 17:05:04 I am utterly astonished that the USA does not have this legislation in place. Every other civilized country has laws like this. Allowing people in power to hold individual stocks is the defintion of a conflict of interest and asking for corruption, QED currently.
812 2018-08-23 17:04:37 That’s really in bad taste.  Suggest you stick to stocks?

838 2018-08-23 16:52:28 Right. I didn't say it was bad thing, just explaining that the huge cash flows into money center banks had to go somewhere and it went into stocks. But a lot of private investors sat out the rally as they were burned by the crash. So, the 1% did really well in Obama's years.
839 2018-08-23 16:52:19 Facts for today.
Only about 50% of Americans own any stocks
85% of all stocks are owned by the top 1%
60% of American own their own homes
Of that 60% only 20% own their home with no mortgage.
3% own more than one home.

877 2018-08-23 16:35:35 I’m dedicated to trading stocks since I started last year. Rich by 25 the plan
878 2018-08-23 16:35:23 All mentioned are relatively safer stocks. Irrespective of the party in power, these shd do well over medium term due to good management
879 2018-08-23 16:35:01 other than that you choppin on glass, my stocks chrome though so what's tha point.
880 2018-08-23 16:34:02 $SSOK is interesting. Had a nice run this week but small pullback now in load zone now. Load up! #traders #otc #stocks #Load
881 2018-08-23 16:32:55 Long term maybe but if you’re looking for a good hobby stocks the way to go
882 2018-08-23 16:32:53 He means the rich 1% GOP will lose money invested in stocks, they won’t get any more tax breaks & they’ll have to really pay taxes!!! Won’t affect the 99% one bit!!!
883 2018-08-23 16:32:51 No, she's trying to end corruption.  Her bill prohibits U.S. Citizens from lobbying for foreign govts, members of congress from owning and trading individual stocks and former members of congress from ever becoming lobbyists.  What's bad about this?
884 2018-08-23 16:32:46 I’m guessing you have no clue who actually approved bump stocks and who actually said ‘wait this might be a bad idea’
You won’t be able to handle the truth so I would just keep head in sand
885 2018-08-23 16:32:41 Well my qualifier was “if you have the basics down” which is some in global stocks bonds and real assets. Exact % don’t matter ...

887 2018-08-23 16:32:26 Hedge funds use a merit based approach 2 asset selection...and this is why most of them perform worse than a monkey throwing darts at a wall to pick stocks.

We overestimate the ability of humans to design merit based selection strategy that perform optimally.
888 2018-08-23 16:32:16 Strong dollar, reversal of 1979 energy spike both helped (and arguably inflation 'moved' into asset price inflation - stocks, real estate - as the flip side of falling rates).
889 2018-08-23 16:31:21 Lol gotta think long term. I’m not saying stocks are bad. But real estate is a better alternative long term.

891 2018-08-23 16:30:22 How do you turn a profit off that though stocks are faster
892 2018-08-23 16:30:02 Opinionated frameworks like Angular enforce patterns created and vetted by a large community.  A good risk like buying large cap stock.  I can roll my own framework and I might even succeed...a high risk akin to buying penny stocks.   #softwaredevelopment
893 2018-08-23 16:29:06 You were like the rock, keeps ever falling back on profits-just because it is far from insuperable; though in ever so much the same quantity of paupers numbered in the several imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked, so that it never did.

897 2018-08-23 16:27:33 Smash 4's combo game still left something to be desired tbh. 64 and Melee (and traditional fighters) are way more "1 player" on hit and super fun to watch/play. Heavy combos with 3 stocks would be perfect
898 2018-08-23 16:27:23 Which market are talking about...we are getting daily 10 to 20% in stocks....this is a good trading market
899 2018-08-23 16:26:01 Imagine trading penny stocks over cryptos
900 2018-08-23 16:24:48 @StockmanNigeria Please educate me on these - Firstly, are you saying this on the basis of established principles that insurance stocks are inherently illiquid? Secondly, where can I find sufficient data on the sector for my models? Thirdly, how is data mined in Nigeria?
901 2018-08-23 16:24:33 $SPY Most will wait for market to go green again before believing it's bullish. I'm seeing (better) opportunity lower, on select stocks.

903 2018-08-23 16:23:31 Yep.....and our investments in banking stocks are doing well....great payback. The middle class are also shareholders....

907 2018-08-23 16:22:56 Trump’s been touting the stock market growth since February, but in November the S&P still lagged behind Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom.

In any case, the U.S. stock performance mirrors a global rise in stocks, suggesting it is not unique.

911 2018-08-23 16:22:32 I wonder what it would look like with falling stocks.

920 2018-08-23 16:20:19 Actually now beaten down stocks r also catching up so possibility is there that we may see fast upmove from here.
921 2018-08-23 16:20:19 If by that you mean a large, stinky, mean, prancing animal I guess so. You, the bull, have embolded insider trading, fraud, and false valuation by giving corporate America more money to buy back their own stocks, so be it.
But here comes the slaughter...and his name is Mueller

944 2018-08-23 16:12:28 Ya it would tank because he passed a ridiculous tax cut for the wealthy who are using that to invest in their own stocks and artificially inflate the market which will inevitably cause it to crash.He put this crash in motion and it will take a miracle to stop it even if he’s out

976 2018-08-23 16:01:06 Yes, it happens for stocks sometimes. A random chart will produce up/down spikes like that, too, once a year. But how often does it happen for GRPN, or any given regulated traded security? Because for BTC, it’s almost a daily occurrence.

985 2018-08-23 15:56:08 $VKTX not sure what's going on here. $PFE said they're interested in NASH & metabolic disorders, but $MDGL and the other NASH stocks are doing nothing. Technical break leading to short squeeze maybe? Much spec on options though. Still months b4 data.  I'll take it though.
986 2018-08-23 15:56:03 What platform do you use to trade stocks under $.01?
987 2018-08-23 15:55:43 Beyond these, insurance #Stocks are not liquid. There are enough data we can data-mine
988 2018-08-23 15:55:19 Yes, the Framers of the Constitution put Wall Street above Law.  I hear they also were very bullish on BioTech stocks....
989 2018-08-23 15:54:48 I need more friends who deal with stocks regularly.
990 2018-08-23 15:54:42 So if POTUS is impeached and the markets collapses, as he predicts, that's a great time to buy some stocks.  Historically the market, even with its ups and downs, far outpaces inflation.

992 2018-08-23 15:54:18 How much of this economic growth is due to:

* more coal plant expansions that were previously too costly because of pollution regulations

* more private prisons... just check out the prison stocks. Good thing?

* predatory lending and ‘diploma mill’ online colleges back

993 2018-08-23 15:54:17 Come on, Rosie, best economy in 15 years, why do you bother looking at data? Just buy stocks.
994 2018-08-23 15:54:08 I’m not saying it didn’t crash under Bush. Of course it did. I’m saying that recovery under President Obama is not a true representation of his policies taking a stock market and doubling it. Many lost their money-sold their stocks? A good portion or half was just rebalancing
995 2018-08-23 15:53:34 I’m interested in hearing someone’s experience shorting #PotStocks as the term is thrown around a lot HOWEVER finding someone who has real experience exclusively doing that is hard to find. I don’t short stocks FYI just would like to learn more about the other side.

997 2018-08-23 15:53:17 Less than 50% of Americans actually own anything in the stock market - and really about 5% of Americans own most of the stocks. The GOP wants to tout growth for that 5% while destroying health care for the rest.
998 2018-08-23 15:52:28 I have lost on individual stocks before. I’ve been investing in SPY since 2014, and the market has been doing well since then. I’m up about 35% on that investment.

1008 2018-08-23 15:48:31 Most of my brokerage account is comprised of an S&P ETF. It does pay a dividend and it mimics the S&P 500. It’s a good way to invest in the market as a whole without doing all of the research required for individual stocks. I reinvest the dividends.
1009 2018-08-23 15:48:23 And stocks return to their rightful owners.

1015 2018-08-23 15:47:30 Perhaps you should buy stocks in tissues, you may need large amounts in the future. I see the Trump cult is feeling a bit of pressure, it must be strange to feel so behind history.

1050 2018-08-23 15:36:14 Everbody?
84% of stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10% of Americans.
Only that 10% benefits from record Dow Jones closings.
And 30% of stocks are owned by foreign investors benefiting foreign countries. And those who assist foreign investors in money laundering.
1051 2018-08-23 15:36:08 Fisheries quotas are determined by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (not the EU) to maintain viable stocks.

1070 2018-08-23 15:31:11 It's likely that crypto will drop first

And then profit heavily off crypto returns... this is the likely scenario

1174 2018-08-23 15:03:22 He's actually right, but stocks are also going to crash if he doesn't get impeached.

1199 2018-08-23 14:56:35 Well the bull market lasted a few years. Everyone just missed the boat. Also this has been a time for growth stocks not value investing so the timing was bad
1200 2018-08-23 14:56:12 So I’m looking up how to go about investing in stocks and I see that a full service broker usually only work with people with a minimum account balance of $50,000  let me get my broke ass off this site

1222 2018-08-23 14:48:59 It think that’s what’s Trump’s plan. Did you see the Fox and Friends Interview KB? He said if he ever got impeached by the Dems the Stocks/Economy would tank.
1223 2018-08-23 14:48:44 I enjoy "if/then" stocks that cost $14 million, for the gambles that they are.    You see these sado's with the same equation for their $60 BILLION car company and it's like "Maaaate, you're gambling wrong!  $60 Bil cap is for a boring stock to leave for your grandkids."

1262 2018-08-23 14:37:55 It’s thoroughly depressing how morally bankrupt this clown is. It’s all about personalities with him, if OJ had tweeted such racism he’d be calling for him to be put in the stocks!

As it’s someone who he agrees with politically...racism, what racism?
1263 2018-08-23 14:37:47 And they don’t allow you to buy cannabis stocks either!! Same company that cheated Customers by opening Accounts without customer knowledge . Also, push employees to do it or get fired ! #WellsFargo#Banking#MMJ#Banks
1264 2018-08-23 14:37:46 I’m wondering if Eurodollars can break if stocks keep rallying like this.

1271 2018-08-23 14:35:46 Nasdaq this is how dot-com bubble burst- weak hands shorts throw in the towel and cover, FOMO traders think stocks are cheap-Analyst ignoring that all good news is priced in, yet raise price targets-valuations are ignored, insider selling ignored. $QQQ $SPY $IWM $EEM $DIA

1273 2018-08-23 14:34:52 No; #stocks keep climbing - for now - because it's a bubble, same pattern housing was: soaring prices while incomes of working-aged near flat and many incomes nil.
1274 2018-08-23 14:34:35 Different metrics matter for different types of investments and different industries, that’s why analysis is helpful. For growth stocks you want to see YOY (year over year) increases of revenue, EPS mainly. If they have a lot of debt u need to know they’re leveraging it properly

1302 2018-08-23 14:25:39 So to know if a stock is smallcap or midcap or largecap, one has to know the marketcap of all stocks greater that stock. Simply brilliant!!!

1304 2018-08-23 14:25:16 If stock market is the measure of nations wealth then you have to ask who owns stocks in the USA- the rich.

1320 2018-08-23 14:21:37 If he thinks the market would crash & he thinks everybody would be very poor, is it safe to assume he thinks everybody owns stocks?

Because I know plenty of folks I wouldn't consider "poor" who don't own stocks. But I guess we probably fit his definition of "poor".

1503 2018-08-23 13:31:23 No... The stick market translates into how much stocks cost. And a crash makes them cheaper. The stick market is only a canary in a coal mine - it can react to an economy but not control it.

1509 2018-08-23 13:29:13 Stocks would definitely tumble. A sudden shift in economic policy would cause chaos. Political turmoil is never good for an economy. I doubt we would enter a recession.

1629 2018-08-23 12:42:29 Not at all. Health insurance and energy stocks would go up. Others would rise because the risk of a moron starting a trade war that would damage thousands of American companies would be eliminated.  Impeachment won’t happen because the GOP is soulless and gutless.

1642 2018-08-23 12:37:24 Since Trump won, US stocks (S&P 500) have doubled the performance of non-US stocks (MSCI World ex-US index) at positive 34% v 17.6%. That's the Trump factor, helping the US break away from the rest of the world. Lose him and his America-first policies, and we could fall back

1701 2018-08-23 12:09:22 Trump  running scared and now threatens the stock market "says markets will crash if impeached " in my opinio a crash would be good to bring S&P below 2000, stocks are trading at insanes values at the moment .

1752 2018-08-23 11:39:06 And I go home in cash, 95% of what i do is day trade, like SMB. Stocks in play, with range. I really dont even follow the market that close, just what im trading. LABU looks ready to explode, would like a pullback there. Ill vote for Trump in 2020. Unless the left has a good idea

1760 2018-08-23 11:32:15 Wow! Your first stock post in months! Could it be because since January stocks have stopped going up? They are just hovering around 25k now..
1761 2018-08-23 11:32:03 For some reason I don’t get any company related stuff from the stocks I own within my isa.  VRS included
1762 2018-08-23 11:30:59 The economy post WWII was absolutely dominant, and the roaring 20’s. Now, we have perhaps the worst gap between the rich and the poor in our country’s history and stagnating wages. Stocks are doing well though, so visit your local hedge fund manager and give him a high five

1766 2018-08-23 11:26:29 My discussion for individual stocks aren't there because recent stock market is too high to trade stocks now. Many investor or many magazine talk about the stocks whose price will rise. I can't trust their message. That talk itself might be somewhat misleading.
1767 2018-08-23 11:26:07 the growth of The Spectator @spectator is because it's no longer about finding the odd newsagent that stocks it. Everyone can access it now. Living in a provincial town I have access to film criticism in a way that was unimaginable 20 years ago.
1768 2018-08-23 11:25:00 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

** Trump says the stock market would crash if he were impeached.  Separate news, U.S. stocks set to open flat on Thursday

** Asia markets mixed. Alibaba shares rally surge 61% (WOW!)

** European markets also mixed as new China tariffs kick in
1769 2018-08-23 11:24:12 Thanks to Obama and our global economy! You do know that most Americans do not own stocks, right?
1770 2018-08-23 11:22:58 So @Clicks_SA is following in the dismal path of @Dischem in no longer stocking inexpensive generics. For the past three months not one outlet we've tried stocks ibuprofen generics, only the ultracostly overpriced Nurofen etc.

1777 2018-08-23 11:19:17 Not only that but Dominic Raab in his speech today that some business' may actually have to fill in an online form. Disgraceful! Raab should be put in the stocks until further notice! 
1778 2018-08-23 11:18:02 Then why are all my stocks going down?
1779 2018-08-23 11:16:39 Trump - It will crash, because you have definitely corrupted stocks as well
1780 2018-08-23 11:16:18 Once again, on Liquidity for marketable securities.

Liquidity for marketable securities is very important. First if you'd like to sell your stocks, you can take the action at any second. You can save your asset before the market crush for instance.

1816 2018-08-23 10:54:14 The broader market was wholeheartedly outperforming in 2007 end as well as late 2017. In hindsight that seems more worrisome than a market going up lead by a handful of stocks.

1832 2018-08-23 10:40:06 Lots of tight patterns forming. Most look bullish to me. All we need is a little movement to get things going.

1858 2018-08-23 10:16:49 So what I recommend is once you hit that point, reduce how much of your bankroll you risk, instead of risking 100% all the time...  You can try playing in larger share price stocks, but a lot of those don't move 10% in mere seconds, minutes, hours, or even days...

1863 2018-08-23 10:13:41 It sounds easy, but as your bankroll increases it's harder to jump in and out of stocks effectively with big money. There is a, what I call natural resistance as you play with more money. When you throw 6 figures into a stock you effect its share price, especially when you sell.

2206 2018-08-23 04:44:53 It’s great news that the market has made so many people a lot of money, including those that do not have much to begin with. Truly capitalism works for everyone! If you invested about $10 k in famng stocks for example, in 2009  it’s probably worth over $500 k right now.
2207 2018-08-23 04:44:30 Yeah I’m a big fan of the HSA if that’s viable for you. What doesn’t get spent gets invested and I put a lot of it into tech stocks which has put me decades ahead of any regular savings account so far

Great fortunes come from owning a company with great economics for decades, after all.

2372 2018-08-23 02:37:00 I think it's amazing to see what his co has turned in to.  I've been working in the FC for over a year now and am quite content with my comp pkg.  (Which incl reg raises the first 2 years, monthly bonus and stocks.)
2373 2018-08-23 02:36:48 You do know this benefits a minority of Americans, right? Most of your "nationalist" base doesn't own stocks. But sure, keep talking to the 1%. Keep taking.
2374 2018-08-23 02:36:19 You are really speaking of things you know absolutely nothing about! Not to mention the fact you have the opportunity to buy stocks, you have the opportunity to have a 401k. Supply and demand, the industry that I am in, wages are much higher. More jobs available then workers
2375 2018-08-23 02:36:17 Wish you well my friend. Majority of my "mad money" is in conservative dividend stocks.  Have hand in speculative ones and some are on the exciting side. $RIBZ being one......
2376 2018-08-23 02:35:54 Nope. You're hamstringing yourselves. Not my fault that bottom half chose to have kids they can't afford, chose playing video games 24/7 over a trade or school. Or they choose fancy gadgets over practical ones. Not my fault. And I'm not rewarding you for doing that.
2377 2018-08-23 02:35:07 People still buy stocks?
2378 2018-08-23 02:35:06 He has done nothing to help stocks other than giving the rich an unpaid tax cut so they can not invest in their business, rather buying back their own stocks.

2380 2018-08-23 02:34:06 What the hell does that have to do with the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? I thought you were fixing CHICAGO? How about the 500 children who still aren't with their parents? What about bump stocks? RESIGN
2381 2018-08-23 02:34:02 7. Tell you what. You want 15? I want the bottom 50% to pay their fair share of taxes. 2.8% ain't it. 28% would be a nice starting point. Let's see how 15 looks after taxes.
2382 2018-08-23 02:33:10 isn’t that the argument in China. Stocks 52 week lows, but pundits say economy strong plus 6.2-7.2% . Stocks not reflection
2383 2018-08-23 02:32:53 she uses  the pissed white of stocks while she is sheepishly confused.
2384 2018-08-23 02:32:48 If you’re an accountant then COOL ! It does not mean you’re an expert in stocks or stock buybacks. Especially if you read the results of what’s going on.
2385 2018-08-23 02:32:47 6. IRS 2017 filing stats have 177M filers. Of that 50% paid 97.2% in Fed Income. You're in the bottom 50%. Your group paid a whopping 2.8%. And you actually, with a straight face no less, demand we be taxes more so you can get paid more.
2386 2018-08-23 02:31:21 Great phone!! So my question is how the availability will be? Regular xiaomi flash sales or more like one plus who supply sufficient stocks at the earliest. Cant wait to grab one! #GoPOCO @jaimani @IndiaPOCO
2387 2018-08-23 02:31:15 I’m not debating about the corrupt destruction of the value of stocks by companies who artificially inflate them because its basic knowledge and is a corrupt policy that does nothing for shareholders or consumers and only pockets higher wealth for greedy men
2388 2018-08-23 02:31:13 5. To prevent that from happening we have no choice but simply not hire you. Robots can do the job of flipping burgers and picking crops. It's either that or our economic landscape changes to fewer choices and lower quality of life.
2389 2018-08-23 02:30:02 Yes sir! And stocks like $CANB for only become hotter and hotter after Labor Day, and more so after the farm bill has gone through!
2390 2018-08-23 02:29:52 4. You just jacked over everyone. All of our costs of living is going to go through the roof. Most businesses who operate on less than 2% profit margin (if you don't know the difference between profit and profit margin, look it up) are dead in the water.
2391 2018-08-23 02:28:48 3. This is what happens. You close that gap, we want more. We have the separation for a reason: Because we earned it. You haven't. No way are you worth $15 v. tech support, cops, soldiers, EMTs, accountants, what have you. You close that gap...

2393 2018-08-23 02:27:57 You nevertrumpers  make us love him more.  BTW, what have you done to help the American people?  Trump has lowered MY taxes and my stocks have skyrocketed.  So you really need to shut up #MAGA

2395 2018-08-23 02:27:33 So.. Can you invest in Blockchain?  Serious Brain traumas caused me to forget large portions of life but, it also gave me a love of new ideas like buying stocks, even if it is only $10 a month  I am trying to learn to live again + remember
2396 2018-08-23 02:27:29 What is the damage he is doing? Asking for border security, protection for American workers or Asking for fair trade deals?

Stocks are at record highs and due to his policies, economy posted 4.1 GDP. He was mocked by "experts" for saying that he can achieve 3% GDP.
2397 2018-08-23 02:26:58 2 You want everything on a silver platter. $15/hr, free college, free healthcare and you want to hammer us, those who did everything right, for what? Parity? You think I want you or anyone else to get $15 for basic, bare-boned, non-existent skills and have you close the wage gap?
2398 2018-08-23 02:26:35 @realDonaldTrump
The Stock Market is not the economy.Did you not learn that @Wharton?Or perhaps you skipped Econ 101.The market is weighted and driven by a handful of high priced stocks.There are many metrics that help explain the economy, and the market is only one segment.

2411 2018-08-23 02:14:50 Please.  PLEASE tell us how what he's done is ok.  We're dying to know what we (and the entire world) is missing. Tarrifs?  Jobs lost. Stocks? Great for the 1%, but wages have stifled. No collusion? What about flat out lying? "I did not have sex with that woman"? Child's play.
2412 2018-08-23 02:13:34 How nice for you, congratulations. I wonder what the guy who stocks shelves in the evening for min. wage, flips burgers in the afternoon, for min wage and does odd handyman jobs when he can would give to have access to a 401k. most min. wage earners don't have that perk.

Didn’t your company get a YUGE tax cut last year? Did you put that money into your company or just buy stocks back?  Don’t blame the dang tariffs.  #BS
2417 2018-08-23 02:08:50 There are several indicators, 1) trading point: low volume, forced push up, concentration i. teflon stocks (nvdia, amz, aapl etc). 2) Geopolitical, trump changed the order...repricing necessary! 3) Psych: complacency...
2418 2018-08-23 02:08:40 Won’t ever happen. If it happens, inflation will wash out wages. Just accept it as a loss. Invest in stocks or wait for the crash. #buylow

2420 2018-08-23 02:08:04 Ok. Hear me out. If more people shift from active to indexing and the active funds happen to be disproportionately value based you can cause a positive feedback loop into growth stocks.

2423 2018-08-23 02:07:07 Interesting article but I like the safety of having some money saved for emergencies even though I still have some student loan debt.

I don’t want to keep all my savings in my bank account though and earn 
.003% interest on it, so I invest in some stocks.
2424 2018-08-23 02:06:50 With the way things are going where it seems like it’s turning into flag football, I’m selling. Just like stocks, you always sell high.
2425 2018-08-23 02:05:46 U.S. Market Check

    U.S. stocks slipped yesterday, halting a four-day advance as weakness in industrials outweighed gains in technology shares.
2426 2018-08-23 02:05:26 Asian stocks meandered this morning, with Australia’s benchmark down  modestly and Japan little changed, while shares nudged higher in South  Korea. Futures tipped a firmer open in Hong Kong.

2430 2018-08-23 02:01:17 I saw the same thing in the late 90’s.  On a TCW call a PM said they viewed all the tech names with 300+ PEs as value stocks because they were growing at 600+ percent.  PEG at 0.5 and all that.  #didntendwell
2431 2018-08-23 01:58:02 RIGHT!
1 single person murdered is too many!

So I’m Ute you will agree with this:
Many innocent people were murdered by assault rifles & bump-stocks.
It’s time to outlaw assault rifles & bump-stocks!!!

2436 2018-08-23 01:54:14 Share market is going strong. But main concern is that only few stocks are advancing
2437 2018-08-23 01:53:54 ETFs and individual stocks with no dividend are also considerations for taxable accounts. Especially when they are “buy and hold” and will qualify for long term capital gains after 12 months; or step up in basis for heirs after owners death.
2438 2018-08-23 01:50:05 I use Origins Ginger Rush, which is only ever available in the pre-Xmas season but which stocks up well for a year. One big tub of it (6.7 oz/200 ml) is about $36, but I usually only need two to three runs a year, and I use it a LOT.
2439 2018-08-23 01:49:13 If you're one of them, make sure you examine the stocks in your portfolio to make sure they'll hold up when the market turns bearish! #investing #stocks
2440 2018-08-23 01:48:44 It’s really lovely and the uht version tastes just as nice as the fridge version. Asda stocks it more than most and you’ll always get it at waitrose. Very refreshing. Closest to dairy I’ve found, but with ‘cleaner’ taste.
2441 2018-08-23 01:48:16 I bet most of those West Virginians at your rally did not benefit from the stock market increases because they don't have stocks or have minimal savings. You have no idea what it is to be poor in America and how many people live in squalor.

2473 2018-08-23 01:24:56 TWN Stocks: TMB (4147中裕) - to put in perspective the ridiculousness of the situtation: $51MM of sales in NT is like $1.7M USD.   Not enough to pay rent, salaries, or anything else, for that matter.    TMB (4147中裕) has a market cap of >$2B USD.   Insane!

2478 2018-08-23 01:21:32 It's a no brainer. When you have no more money than what you need to serve the basics of your life, stocks are a luxury. It is like asking a guy to go to racecourse when he can't afford a beachside buggy ride.
2479 2018-08-23 01:20:46 Time to short stairmaster stocks
2480 2018-08-23 01:20:07 I would like all who were in favor to be in stocks and be thrown rotten fruit and then apologize before being permitted back in politics.

2483 2018-08-23 01:15:34 I think you’re confused. What stocks are you referring to? Can you provide a link or something to show this?
2484 2018-08-23 01:14:31 I am in!  My stocks are booming, baby!
2485 2018-08-23 01:13:49 Wheat stocks are on the rise, good call
2486 2018-08-23 01:13:40 SOCIAL SOLIDARITY stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
2487 2018-08-23 01:13:28 Yeah,

Sometimes it seems like the investor is being strangled by the manipulated price.
2488 2018-08-23 01:12:48 Agreed for reversal but risk is some stocks are yet to breakout and stocks which broken out have slightly bigger SL. #marginofsafety #riskreward
2489 2018-08-23 01:12:12 Interest rates are rising; stocks are at an all time high-which means they are more likely to drop with any bad news, Oil is getting high, trade war with China a disaster.

2491 2018-08-23 01:11:46 I have always thought price weighted to be a wrong way of Index computation. I skews the index towards stocks with high price which might not deserve it. In comparison, computation of our indices which is based on market cap is definitely better. Any thoughts?
2492 2018-08-23 01:11:26 Again. Thanks #44. Bull market stocks is 103 months. #45 owns 11 of them. I swear, I can't make this ish up. #OMAGA
2493 2018-08-23 01:10:59 #stocks -price of bitcoin is Unchanged from where is was trading b4 the SEC announcement rejecting bitcoin ETF. It was bout $6.420 before &
After pullback its back to $6420 non-event
2494 2018-08-23 01:10:15 I can't speak to this re: crypto; but in stocks, you can use that info and ride the wave with them! And the other guys go to jail.  ;) 

See $AWX recently. There could be some SEC issues with it, but only looking at a particular firm; not us retail guys that jumped on.
2495 2018-08-23 01:07:45 Liar! If stocks are doing at all well it is thanks to President Obama and despite you, you racist, crooked, traitorous moron
2496 2018-08-23 01:05:29 U.S. stocks closed mixed Wednesday,08/22/18: $DJIA -0.34% (-88.6) at 25,733.60, $SPX -0.04% (-1.1) at 2,861.82, $COMPQ +0.38% (+29.9) at 7,889.10.
2497 2018-08-23 01:04:25 @CanopyGrowth I love your company. Buying more stocks
2498 2018-08-23 01:03:43 Kalonovic :In summary, buybacks are creating a shortage of US stocks, the Fed is creating a shortage of US dollars, and Trump’s trade wars and sanctions are further boosting the USD.
2499 2018-08-23 01:02:46 j’aime pas les stocks genre toi j’aime pas psq t trop tracé, les deux ils étaient normal hein
2500 2018-08-23 01:02:35 U.S. stocks closed mixed Wednesday,08/22/18: $DJIA -0.34% at 25,733.60, $SPX -0.04% at 2,861.82, $COMPQ +0.38% at 7,889.10, $RUT +0.26% at $1722.54.
2501 2018-08-23 01:01:44 Trump isn't doing anything different from his predecessor. The same bullshit 10$ an hour low wage jobs with stagnant wage increase is the same nonsense that was under Obama. 80% of stocks are owned by 10% of the pop. So high stock market is only benefitting 10%.
2502 2018-08-23 01:01:42 TWN Stocks: TMB (4147中裕) looks more and more like a fraud - it has $51MM of sales for the first 7 months.  In NT, not USD.    Which is telling you that its product is just about worthless.  And so is its stock.
2503 2018-08-23 01:00:32 My stocks are now worth triple what I purchased them for. Thank you!
2504 2018-08-23 00:59:32 True, although that is common in a falling wedge pattern. I'm going to watch it for a bit and see what it does. Trying to do this for as many stocks as I can to learn what works and what doesn't. Again, not so much on pot stocks because I was bearish on weed and then bam, $5B!
2505 2018-08-23 00:58:42 can anyone tell me what the thinking is behind volume nodes in a volume profile (or point me to a resource that can)? #stocks #trading #futures #options #technicalanalysis
2506 2018-08-23 00:57:53 Stocks which presents gifts for investors are bought before date of right allotment. If you sell your stocks in these days, you can escape from xxx day.
2507 2018-08-23 00:57:07 That quote is so correct though. Media and Liberals won't be so mad if Trump was not so effective. As per them stocks were supposed to tank, economy was going to be in ruins,  Trump was going to start a nuclear war and there would be a blue wave...
2508 2018-08-23 00:56:55 Oh and shout out to smart savvy traveler B who ALLLWAYS stocks up on gars before going ANYWHEREEE!
2509 2018-08-23 00:56:22 Legit question .. what percentage of Americans are actually invested in stocks ?
2510 2018-08-23 00:56:15 Actually, Elizabeth Warren admits it with no problem and she's working hard to make changes for the future regarding the corruption of politicians turned lobbyists, politicians and stocks, and politicians having businesses on the side.
2511 2018-08-23 00:56:12 The feds are talking about raising interest rates. If/when that happens I’m hopping in the bank stocks for a nice swing trade. It’ll raise the value of our dollar so banks should be bullish.

Back when you took this public, you did so because you had no choice. Since then, you have had ppl buy it just to use the stocks to attack you and manipulate the company.
Please take us private.
Plain and simple, many of us stockholders TRUST you, but not the manipulators.
2514 2018-08-23 00:55:29 At 5 per ... it is stupid... and does not affect the stocks...ffs
2515 2018-08-23 00:55:23 Part of me is beginning to hope that Trump is impeached & the FBI/DOJ/CIA can continue to control elections, tax cuts get repealed, taxes go up, the economy tanks, stocks crash, illegals flood neighborhoods, employers cut jobs & wages so liberals will finally be happy.

2519 2018-08-23 00:53:18 What if there was a side bracket where each team gets 4 stocks, and it's up to them how to divide them. You can have 4 people with one stock each, 2 people with one stock and one person with two, 2 people with 2 stocks each, or 1 person with 4 stocks.

2521 2018-08-23 00:52:04 @SenWarren's bill to ban congressmen from lobbying and owning stocks would have no effect on corruption or ethics. The main main way for "buying" politicians is campaign donations or PAC support (constitutional right). Warren's bill is just talk for her base. #Corruption

2529 2018-08-23 00:45:54 Though once again he's doing it to protect himself not so much for you. If you're racist and don't want White people to lose the majority in this country for an extra 5-10 years he's working for you. If you're a business owner who wanted to buy back stocks working for you.

The whole nation - each city - could reach out to Chicago in some way.   We have to save Chicago.   Group called "Save Chicago"?

2543 2018-08-23 00:35:46 It is unbelievable, President Donald Trump has built this country with so many jobs starts going up with stocks and people putting him down, Democrats have gone crazy, and I was a Democrat last year and changed to Republican, and I thank Hillary Clinton 
2544 2018-08-23 00:34:01 I’m in Kzoo we should get together and talk stocks haha
2545 2018-08-23 00:31:32 ryan's kids and ours will feel what ryan did to America for money . Sad, bc its not cash money,  ryan!  it's in stocks, foreign banks, which can disappear just like 45, after 45 takes all y'all$$

2547 2018-08-23 00:31:12 Online, like trading stocks online, is all automated bots now w no edge
2548 2018-08-23 00:31:07 This is great news for the rich. Too bad that the "forgotten blue collar workers" in this country that Trump claimed to represent don't own stocks. Less than 50% of the population is invested in the markets.  Great news for Trump's corporate masters though.
2549 2018-08-23 00:30:01 Options trading, Stocks, charts and lots of learning
2550 2018-08-23 00:28:41 I probably sold $COST too soon at $220. Need better rules for evaluating exits in stocks that are working... this is what I get for not buying enough and exiting incrementally.
2551 2018-08-23 00:28:29 Research published earlier this year by an economist at New York University found that more than 80% of all stocks owned by Americans are held by the wealthiest 10% of households. Almost half of US households have absolutely nothing invested.
2552 2018-08-23 00:28:19 Go back to Trump's campaign.  Trump claimed the market was going to crash at any moment and that it was all just a bubble like the housing crisis. Claimed he had already sold all his stocks and gotten out of the market before it happened.  Now he wants credit for it.
2553 2018-08-23 00:27:52 I gotta learn stocks before this year Is done
2554 2018-08-23 00:26:18 Nearly half of country has $0 invested in the market, according to the Federal Reserve and numerous surveys by groups such as Gallup and Bankrate. That means people have no money in pension funds, 401(k) retirement plans, IRAs, mutual funds or ETFs. They don't own stocks.
2555 2018-08-23 00:25:08 Only 50% of Americans have money invested in stocks. The stock market shouldn’t be the only measure of success.
2556 2018-08-23 00:22:18 $vet i been out the loop with how $ven is now $vet and its priced under $.02 and its supply incresed like 100x. almost like how stocks dilute their shares

2560 2018-08-23 00:15:40 Trump's tax cuts didnt do anything for the economy. Money at the top stays at the top. The middle class got shafted. Those "years of stock market growth" start in Obama 1 you Foxoron. You think the markets doing great? Buy some stocks you knuckledragger and brag at me in 2 years.
2561 2018-08-23 00:15:29 From the liquid leaders to the random penny stocks, the whole pot group is thus far holding gains extremely well
2562 2018-08-23 00:14:50 How about this: for the next month, notice what you can get for $15. How many hours would someone would have to work at $15/hour to buy your cell phone, groceries, gas, etc. Look up the budget options if your things are too fancy.

Is your perception of dollar value accurate?

2569 2018-08-23 00:04:39 Globally and locally the spectre of political unrest is haunting investors. The conviction of two associates of President Trump on separate matters pre-empted a cautious trading session where both the US dollar and top stocks fell @MicMcCarthy_CMC
