70 2018-04-30 23:51:51 Agreed. High volume breakouts kick off trends. This is a natural markets phenomenon, more easily observable (and tradeable) in iliquid markets such as crypto. Crypto markets are extremely directional and thus relatively easier to trade than most non-crypto markets.
71 2018-04-30 23:51:46 Juist !
72 2018-04-30 23:51:11 What do you make of the JP Morgan report that claims only ~$6 billion net dollar inflow into crypto?

76 2018-04-30 23:50:31 One of the common counterpoints I see during dialogues about crypto mass adoption is: "People need need something tangible..."

148 2018-04-30 23:42:30 No not currently. It’s PoS but it’s an ERC20 token so maybe staking will be possible this summer when ETH adopts PoS. If CS staking is possible right now I don’t know how to do it.

155 2018-04-30 23:41:45 If the explanation for why something in #crypto won't work is "because we've never done it like that before" don't get frustrated. Most people have a hard time conceptualizing innovations that challenge the status quo. Civil discourse and education are key.
156 2018-04-30 23:41:44 I think you can make a beneficial argument for a law degree in pretty much any industry :) I don't regret my JD because I think legal education has its merits, and hey, who knows if I'd have fallen down the crypto rabbit hole if I had done even one thing differently?
157 2018-04-30 23:41:19 Really want some, and love the project but what's your opinion on how many coins are entering the ecosystem each day? Feels like scarcity is going to take 8 years to happen

“There is something here that is worthy of greater attention," @giancarloCFTC says at #MIGlobal, noting that the emergence of cryptos is in part a reaction to lost faith in the banking system.

221 2018-04-30 23:32:39 If you can fix and resell slightly broken tools, you probably don't even need crypto.
222 2018-04-30 23:32:10 People are FOMOing into twitter calls blindly so often, that even 10k accounts can move smaller markets. If big guys with good track record would start shilling coins again it would be a nightmare
223 2018-04-30 23:32:00 Registered shares trading on blockchains is easy to do, you need a restricted class of tokens that require KYC'ed addresses to have a valid transfer. I was referring to all the ERC20 tokens that were issued unregistered last year. Currency, and crypto-derivatives much bigger.

282 2018-04-30 23:24:04 Ca vous intéresse un thread où je commence avec 500 balles que je ferai migrer de cryptomonnaie en cryptomonnaie et jvous montre les gains/pertes (je vous demanderai sur quelle crypto miser parfois) ?
283 2018-04-30 23:23:42 5? Holy shit, I dont think I made it to even 1 yet. XD
284 2018-04-30 23:23:33 selling my car for msp :P
285 2018-04-30 23:23:27 Did someone buy the entire book on Qryptos for $FSN/ETH?
286 2018-04-30 23:23:27 yeah I need to update my video card but fuck that crypto markup.
287 2018-04-30 23:23:25 Hxx is shit
288 2018-04-30 23:23:21 I honestly don't think there's any real difference. Western democracies feel even worse because they criminalize every single act of kindness here; but everyone just pretends that this crypto-eugenics hellscape is just... normal.

297 2018-04-30 23:21:56 Hey @joerogan - love your podcast! Would be cool to have @ted_livingston on to talk about crypto! #crypto @kin_foundation
298 2018-04-30 23:21:50 Projects like @Rewardsdotcom as essential drivers in the crypto economy as they fully enhance the consumer experience by putting real value into the currency driven by customer. This creates an underlying microeconomy that gives the currency true trackable value. All da best!
299 2018-04-30 23:21:42 Sweet! I'll shoot you a message when I'm down there and maybe we can meet up for a beer.
300 2018-04-30 23:21:35 HAHAHAHAHAHA yes.... That's why
301 2018-04-30 23:21:31 Is there going to be an investment path for non-accredited investors? Beyond excited for this tech.

303 2018-04-30 23:21:01 Btcp is gonna be finished soon  $nix is going to make actual $btc private to everyone who uses decentralised exchanges
304 2018-04-30 23:20:53 3/ Think how much money will flow in after people start to see the gains possible in crypto coming from their respected financial brokers, not some asshole a friend of a friend knows. It's going to be in the trillions. Fill bags for the long term. #bullish
305 2018-04-30 23:20:51 @Vadis50800112 do you offer crypto trade coaching?
306 2018-04-30 23:20:43 i loved mining so much it inspired my Twitter handle. Mining is the fucking reason why i love crypto so much.
307 2018-04-30 23:20:36 Sold at 840, will buy bk below 740.
308 2018-04-30 23:20:33 In other words, it has the same price movement as any other crypto token.

315 2018-04-30 23:19:06 You say "at the expense of poor" but with a deflating currency like BTC the rich no longer have to worry about making 2% to keep up with inflation. Instead they bank their BTC and collect both interest and deflationary gain. Crypto means that the rich rule forever with zero risk.
316 2018-04-30 23:19:00 whenever the those small caps i shared gets listed on major exchanges we will see some early gainers earn a shit ton of money just saying. buy low cap coins my friends. #crypto
317 2018-04-30 23:18:58 Just wondering what your planning on doing next in crypto.  Im planning on placing a massive bet and considering following you on twitter 
318 2018-04-30 23:18:36 Hey @jamesonwhiskey what's your thoughts on crypto currency
319 2018-04-30 23:18:30 Absolutely. Games shouldn't be pay to play and the current reliance on Metamask and high gas fees are a big hindrance to gameplay. We're fans of hybrid free-to-play/crypto approach as it converts "normal" game players into crypto asset owners.
320 2018-04-30 23:18:30 Knowing your timezones can be usefull if you invest in crypto.

368 2018-04-30 23:10:38 2/ When banks set up crypto desks it's their clients, with existing portfolios and money to invest that will be given the option to diversify a portion of their holdings into crypto. Think about how many brokers will recommend this option when they could see gains of 20% in a day

416 2018-04-30 23:04:34 Saying it softly...notice huge investments are pouring into crypto? It's called silent adoption while they buy up their investment. 
Ssssshhhhhhhyyyy!
417 2018-04-30 23:04:18 Oh the irony...a Chinese company accusing a U.S. #crypto of intellectual property infringement.
418 2018-04-30 23:04:10 Totally agree. In crypto, if you call something bs, you’re just spreading FUD. Lol. I had enough.

420 2018-04-30 23:03:42 $crypto twitter doesn't have to be helpful, educational or loaded with useful information. 

This is social media, many people follow for the personalities.

What's wrong with people bullshitting around and just having fun? Why so serious?
421 2018-04-30 23:03:38 Unfortunately I did not like how the card used biometrics. As the world becomes ever more Orwellian I feel it important to have the choice to pay anonymously. We need less government, more decentralisation and a return to individual sovereignty.

425 2018-04-30 23:03:24 I have used Alibaba to import product and I don't think people grasp how big it really is. If this happens, it would be one of the biggest crypto partnerships to date.

433 2018-04-30 23:01:45 It's actually worse in regulated markets because we are told they are pristine. Painful experience shows otherwise. At least with crypto you know there's some kind of something going on...

456 2018-04-30 22:59:04 4)  The 2008 depression was another of this same sort, a sort of failure of nerve of the wealthy class. It would have been as bad as the 1920s depression except for massive Fed pumping (which would be impossible under a gold or fixed crypto standard).

460 2018-04-30 22:58:26 2) The Great Depression was the sort where the wealthy quit spending money. Their characteristic is a huge decline in the "velocity of money". Under a gold / fixed crypto standard there is no way to exit them early and they are massively devastating.

464 2018-04-30 22:57:49 Do you have this copied on your notepad or something. I’ve seen you post this nearly every day. Just promote your own project @BTCNewsUpdates Otherwise you sound like a total scam.
465 2018-04-30 22:57:39 Good boy 
466 2018-04-30 22:57:36 Yeah I assumed it was the easiest to mine in the browsers. Monero is intentionally trying to undermine any advantages for Asics to keep it as decentralized as possoble. I wouldn't mind seeing monero as the top crypto one day.
467 2018-04-30 22:57:30 $BNB 
468 2018-04-30 22:57:07 Yea, these BTCers are all smack-talk and no substance.  No wonder they like the Lightning Network.

480 2018-04-30 22:55:36 I like the system charity:water uses. 100% of donations go to water projects. People donate separately to cover overhead. More credible that way.

502 2018-04-30 22:52:38 Warren Buffett needs to shut up. We get that you don’t like crypto, but you’ve even admitted to not understanding the technology. It will replace money in the same way the “intangible” internet has largely replaced libraries, mail, and numerous businesses.

545 2018-04-30 22:45:58 I would say its being currently integrated into more real world products than any other crypto tech out there. And by major European industrial players too.
546 2018-04-30 22:45:42 Exactly... it’s appalling that it’s still considered by many as the best crypto... 
547 2018-04-30 22:45:37 3 years from now we will be looking back at these prices laughing. We will be wishing we sold our moms for some more crypto. That’s how huge this shit will be.

563 2018-04-30 22:43:40 Stanley and Goldman were just screaming that "crypto" was a bubble and that it would fail. Now they want to come to the party? The "crypto" train is leaving the station: hope people got their bags packed!
564 2018-04-30 22:43:34 so much butt hurt all for what? crypto people need to grow up. I think free internships at wall street will do everyone some good.

571 2018-04-30 22:42:17 No idea but... I believe they have alot of BCH.  They must be well aware of DASH. Pretty much the entire crypto community is.  

When DASH makes BTC its submissive by sponsoring the Miami Bitcoin Conference, people tend to take notice. But even before that.

576 2018-04-30 22:41:44 Ha! Well, remember to state the age of that person. The older generations are completely against and apprehensive of the “new” That’s happening.
577 2018-04-30 22:41:41 Was going to ask if you’ve thought about going all in on crypto.

With USAA, I haven’t been into a physical bank in a couple decades.
578 2018-04-30 22:41:39 No, the whole point is that you don't have a hope in Hell of stopping that "kind of behavior". Humans are the planet's apex predator. The powers that be will easily win. The difference is that gold was still valuable (though illegal for decades) while crypto goes to zero.

603 2018-04-30 22:37:55 We are facing a real dilemma, a fork in the road in this revolution, and I obviously believe that this is a #revolution of #decentralization, with #crypto/#blockchain being the tools #decentralization is using to reinvent the entire human race.

660 2018-04-30 22:31:06 Read the thread for my counter to all of those points. Their "track record" is $3mil/year. So their model would've taken them 52 years to earn what they did in their ICO. Only in Crypto does a 13x valuation sound reasonable.

681 2018-04-30 22:27:32 This case is different a bit here because of what BOA said a while ago. Crypto is not good for their business. Google and amazon are not against his business but crypto is!
682 2018-04-30 22:27:15 ALL CRYPTO Currency. By @FINRA @SEC_Enforcement Those agencies, MUST regulate the Crypto.  Thank you very much.
683 2018-04-30 22:27:03 This truism is what allows PnD scams to dominate the ICO market. Those looking for guidance in the crypto space can't tell the difference between an expert and a shill. And those most knowledgeable understand that motive is typically the only notable difference.
684 2018-04-30 22:26:39 People need to understand that Israel is not protected by God.  They are the synagogue of satan Jesus spoke about.  Conservative America christians have been tricked into supporting Israel by decades of crypto Jews infiltrating christian churches. Hagee was a huge crypto
685 2018-04-30 22:26:02 Nice. The crypto lending space is ripe for growth. Imagine the implications when these types of companies start offering car/home loans!

5月1日朝です。

Cryptopiaは現在メンテ中です。
スケジュールされたメンテらしいのですが、そんなアナウンスあったかな？
いや～な予感、、、。
688 2018-04-30 22:25:51 1/ people & brands try so hard to be “real” that they come off fake or inauthentic online. now purely fictional/virtual instantiations are seen as more honest & relatable—take crypto: a virtual financial system perceived as more trustworthy than wall street/GAFA. next up? ... 
689 2018-04-30 22:25:44 Due to this erroneous fluctuation how about giving me back the $814 that was put into the bad trade or reinstatement of the trade that was being sufficiently monitored and maintained...

691 2018-04-30 22:25:37 2/1 Back to my crypto journal: 
Guy lamented: its not possible to make it in crypto if you're on low budget. You need a 1000 to start!

699 2018-04-30 22:24:51 The average attendance is obviously up. As the Ibrox attendance pushes the average up. But what about individual attendances? Plus, when Rangers did 9, how many times did Celtic finish 2nd? Not many. I don't remember any discussion about what Scottish football needs back then.
700 2018-04-30 22:24:45 Next month Australian people will start to invest money in crypto markets, as of the final of tax return.

710 2018-04-30 22:23:17 We got into a burgeoning market where 10x swings are expected and 100x moves can happen in less than 6 months. This type of movement won’t last forever. We are lucky!

712 2018-04-30 22:22:36 Not quite that simple. I would say we may see a period of increased volatility over the next two weeks, with the possibility of a sharp pull back. Then we think higher probability of a rally building May 15-June 10.

719 2018-04-30 22:21:33 A couple of months before the world cup (98 - France). That was amazing and that brazilian team was unbelievable. The world will never see nothing like that again, it doesn't matter if they losed the final, they will always be the best team in the history of football.

724 2018-04-30 22:20:34 The #Localbitcoins markets of several nations have produced significant spikes in recent weeks, with the peer-to-peer (P2P) markets of Hungary, Peru, and Venezuela establishing new all-time highs for volume when measuring in trade in fiat currency.

725 2018-04-30 22:20:32 I have them both, bought a dip of $chx, already 2x so i'm happy to keep both of them. Although, $TFD is a gem not selling any at this price, still so much undervalued.

733 2018-04-30 22:19:44 Yes and no. Sure in the future we will be using BTC and other crypto currencies for all our needs, but currently we still have to pay bills with Fiat. So setting yourself up via Fiat NOW is still a worthwhile goal.
734 2018-04-30 22:19:33 anyways, i started this account to stay anonymous, talk about crypto/$BTC, what i’m learning (new to the space) blah blah, and kick ass so

738 2018-04-30 22:19:09 Thank you
739 2018-04-30 22:18:55 Same here... crypto la la la land got way too much pump/dump and shilling of non sense coins recently. If (new) investors lose and than mainly shit coins go up... people leave serious coins. Not good. Besides 9 of 10 alts = garbage. The $btc $bch controversy is a bubble itself.
740 2018-04-30 22:18:44 Wise to be careful with giving friends financial advice. We share what we know, give sources, also tell 'm what we believe (XRP is the safest coin with a super future). But still warn: it's crypto, volatile, risky, only put in what you are willing to miss.
741 2018-04-30 22:18:40 Whats the over/under on that Suppoman shills #holochain tomorrow? Ill take the over.

750 2018-04-30 22:17:29 No I was about to pull the trigger yesterday but needed $TFD to pop to reallocate some funds. Can't catch them all sadly.
751 2018-04-30 22:17:26 Something refreshing to see outside crypto...thanks for sharing...
752 2018-04-30 22:17:20 The biggest inefficiency in manufacturing is "Bad Managers." The US economic policy has also had the problem of "Bad Managers." Nicaragua is suffering from them. One reason I love crypto so much is that it eliminates managers. It really is a new concept with new possibilities.

787 2018-04-30 22:11:55 'Scammer' in crypto usually means:

1. I don't like it
2. I don't get it
3. Competition
4. Scam
788 2018-04-30 22:11:33 I've been thinking about this a little more. Wouldn't Golem Network set the cost of H/GNT to be competitive with average cost of setting up a gpu rig? Too much discount could devalue their product?

810 2018-04-30 22:07:41 There is something called value investing if you are willing to do the work and do a proper valuation of the company... that’s for companies with proper data and proper plan on projected earnings ... this for sure is not for crypto, as there is no way to do a valuation yet ..

812 2018-04-30 22:06:56 See, you are a super babe . What a perfect reply.  
813 2018-04-30 22:06:55 i was referring to the crypto steam wallet meme i posted, i deleted it earlier lol
Just was letting people that replied to the old tweet know about me deleting it is all.
814 2018-04-30 22:06:40 maybe just stick to crypto...
815 2018-04-30 22:06:34 I second that.
816 2018-04-30 22:06:12 It would be nice if you could elaborate on why you called the 'crypto top' today, especially because that was a call across multiple coins (when typically you treat each coin independently)

Revolutionary token-based cryptocurrency utilized within a digital ecosystem allowing for instant peer to peer transactions. Main use-case is store of locution value within a decentralized network.

TL-DR; A dictionary on the blockchain.

889 2018-04-30 21:54:24 BTC is just correcting. Holiday tomorrow. Probably bottom a bit under 8500 and then alts will have their next run Wednesday or end of week.
890 2018-04-30 21:54:19 There is always lots of supply when everyone is willing to sell. That is not crypto.
891 2018-04-30 21:54:01 It’s going to be so exciting to see all of the things crypto is capable of. Imagine tipping people on YouTube or gaming streams being massively adopted. This is just one small thing. #bitcoin #crypto #verge #xvg #trx #ada #cardano
892 2018-04-30 21:53:52 And how is that in @CoinMarketCap appears 45 milions as total supply?

895 2018-04-30 21:53:42 You must really support $TRX if you dumped it for $BTC. Speculation is rampant and no coin seems to have supporters when it reaches ATH. Majority of #crypto users are weak hands that do not believe in the tech.

900 2018-04-30 21:52:58 I'm obviously not in the scene long enough to get this way of thinking. The first thing I did when I found crypto was to open up acc's on as many exchanges as I could because first instinct was that if this takes off it could be mayhem...
901 2018-04-30 21:52:53 Not surprised. I bet they didn’t lower the asset management fee. The AI machine could charge fees too. I heard that the self-driving cars will self-managing and self-negotiating. I bet they will love crypto.
902 2018-04-30 21:52:50 April was a great month for @MorphToken :) !!!

Growth from the previous month was ~4x, lots of new users, crypto markets overall (maybe?) bottomed, and we're getting ready to hire new team members!

If you're a full-stack dev interested in joining an emerging team, let me know!
903 2018-04-30 21:52:44 We haven't even started the mania phase of crypto. By the time that happens, we'll all be rich so 
904 2018-04-30 21:52:39 Evangelize people for the power ND usability of Blockchain is only possible when we have great proofs of concept like Bethereum... This is one of the reasons why I am all in in this project.

910 2018-04-30 21:51:50 Right now Coinbase seems like the king, but I see no structural reasons why this would go on. 1) For consumers, there's no network effect, strong competitors are going in (ie Robinhood) and Binance has shown that it's possible to create a big-volume crypto exchange fairly quickly

936 2018-04-30 21:48:10 @AphelionToken has really set a new standard in the crypto space with their new wallet. It is clean ,clean,clean. Excited for the DEX integration. Seriously, give it a shot, you will not be disappointed.
937 2018-04-30 21:48:03 Agreed - the major pieces of @Ripple's long-term plans are falling into place.  Time for the crypto engine to be ignited!  
938 2018-04-30 21:47:52 @YS i think you should stop ripping people off by selling none sense. You did that in crypto..people got rekt..now you do it again with Zero Pattern!
939 2018-04-30 21:47:43 I just see all those charts with a massive oversold Stoch RSI, so I think altseason may just be beginning.

947 2018-04-30 21:46:52 An 8k BTC as you said at the end of your vid would be really bad for crypto right now. Momentum in our favour,hopefully it can push on from here,tho a couple of flat weeks would be fine too I think (good few of my better alts trading in narrow range past few days).

961 2018-04-30 21:45:07 Also bullish long term.  The climb was much steeper in 2013 plus the market was much more fragile back then.  I fully expect 7100 to be tested again however.  Not lower.  Not a pro.  DYOR.  THANKS.

964 2018-04-30 21:44:16 The FA is hard to nail down, cause there are too many factors involved, individual opinions and the volatility/unexpected swings of a new market. I take my crypto trades as a one-movement-at-a-day strategy, because of this. As long as the "alts" are on a impulse I'm keeping them

Good coin with a huge community behind it, hard fork coming and atomic swaps, new Android Wallet and launching on new exchanges, huge potential for big gains.
1055 2018-04-30 21:33:08 I'm trying to bootstrap off less than $2500 and focused on 20% of the community because BCH is the Bitcoin I remembered, but if you have $2500 and can utilize other tools(crypto) go for it. My BTC maximalism made me lose tons by not seeing btc's failures before too late.
1056 2018-04-30 21:32:59 the one thing I agree with you on that is anything but absolute.
1057 2018-04-30 21:32:52 @timicoin any updates on when @timicoin will be listed on crypto exchanges?

1062 2018-04-30 21:32:23 Yes they are not actively talking to exchanges because the coin is seen as a security at this moment, it will be changed to utility when they get swapped for the real tokens I think. But exchanges can list them if they want (see IDEX for example)

1095 2018-04-30 21:29:22 Ye, tbh I think this level will be bigger problem for btc to cross than 12k but You know, time will tell. I am bullish longterm anyway, I really think that btc can reach 50 and even 100k$ level (but I dont need it, just give me few altseasons and btc nearly 15k and I'll be fine)
1096 2018-04-30 21:29:17 @ToshiDesk you know I got XLM, but for $250 BTC. I’m hoping it drops to hit my prediction of .41.  (briefly, Wednesday it can moon)

1121 2018-04-30 21:25:55 @iam_preethi Hey Preethi! I have followed you for a long time, and just saw you are also attending EdCon this week. I work at KeepKey/ShapeShift and would love to connect at the conference to learn about TruStory/talk crypto in general. Let me know if open to meeting up!
1122 2018-04-30 21:25:45 So how do you take profit ed?

1124 2018-04-30 21:25:25 God, bank transactions are slow. 

I'm getting used to #crypto transactions I guess.

Pretty sure banks will have similar processing times in the future ... Or go bankrupt.

1132 2018-04-30 21:24:17 But You know that inv h&s was completed(downtrend line was neckline). Adam and EVE target is around 14k(and even ~17k if full),so its above this resistance(12k). I think we will moon till 14 and then retest 12, which will become support.
1133 2018-04-30 21:24:11 When platforms without a mainnet are worth $10+bn, the question that has to be asked is...what would it take when the product is released to sustain that valuation? Speculation drives the market for pre-product tokens in crypto, that transition to launching is a delicate balance.
1134 2018-04-30 21:24:05 Too bearish, must remember this is crypto we have room to run. I expect alts to keep as long as btc remains bullish
1135 2018-04-30 21:23:38 It's funny that a likely 32 year old dude is pretending to be an 11 year old crypto trader from Manhattan. Trying to use what he thinks is an 11 year olds vernacular.

1174 2018-04-30 21:18:43 Here's what you have to remember about the volatility of crypto, all it takes is for a coin to have its own version of an Ethereum DAO incident and in this market it's done.

1193 2018-04-30 21:17:14 Agreed. I'm happy to see good actors come in, just wary of the nefarious group we're trying replace with our decentralized network and protocol.
1194 2018-04-30 21:17:04 Fiat v BTC is the same battle as Betamax v VHS or HD DVD v BluRay. And again the winner will be decided by pornography. When hookers and strip joints start accepting BTC instead of fiat, the currency/tech will have come of age. Until then, all crypto is just another casino table.

1211 2018-04-30 21:15:20 To me, the core thing that enabled sophisticated investors to make a profit here was the mania for crypto among retail investors. The deal buyers made a bet that retail would pay up, and in this case it was a good bet. Sometimes those bets work and sometimes they don't.
1212 2018-04-30 21:15:11 On a side not...I think Crypto is going to be the birth of a select handful of trillion market cap companies. What gets adopted into a every day currency is still up in the air.

1224 2018-04-30 21:13:45 Bitcoin Cash miners must coordinate a common fund to take care of this.

If they are not intelligent enough, in a matter of time, another crypto with better coordinated miners will overtake them.

1373 2018-04-30 20:55:29 I see a roadmap as a set of goals. The goal of a decent listing has not been reached, no big deal. They cannot give full details on listings as it would have negative consequences. And I'm pretty sure they're getting tired of people asking 'when exchange' at some point (as do I).
1374 2018-04-30 20:55:28 Aye she’s a beauty. She brewing. She will unleash hell!
1375 2018-04-30 20:55:24 I'm not sure any crypto is going to solve your millions of transactions per year requirement right now.  You need external funding to bridge the gap...so what I think I hear is less about the coin and more about the best way to get funding?
1376 2018-04-30 20:55:21 Unreal you can’t use actual cash to deposit...probably because they want to track people even more and/or change more fees...Crypto is for sure the now and future

1421 2018-04-30 20:49:50 #ERC721 and #NFT will promote crypto adoption and finally enable owning unique digital assets on the BlockChain- it should be on everyone’s radar and agenda!
1422 2018-04-30 20:49:46 No big technological startups neither (no need of crypto)

It's not a XXI century country with the actual government. And as you mention, probably due the high taxes and conservative laws (due an old traditional government)

1428 2018-04-30 20:48:29 Aliant offers choice to take payments in percentages. A business could take a payment as 20% crypto, and %80 fiat from what I gather. This lets businesses to  avoid volitility, and still accept crypto, at the same time, without chooseing one over the other.

1448 2018-04-30 20:45:43 2/4 But as #Bermuda pushes ahead with its #blockchain and #crypto strategy, it’s important to note a few things. 1.  #Binance has raised more than a few eyebrows over its operations. It’s highly unregulated.
1449 2018-04-30 20:45:35 There's no exchange located in Spain that is, nothing to do with old people or technology. The problem is probably more due to lack of regulation and the taxes being quite high...
1450 2018-04-30 20:45:31 It converts to fiat at sale, with no option for the vender to keep it as crypto ( which I hope is possible soon with other options, like Aliants terminals). I agree that is what is needed, crypto to crypto, but at least I can bank myself on a small scale with daily expenses.  1/2

1472 2018-04-30 20:42:34 Hi. Usually the equity investors want equity and not tokens, off course community can buy equity too apart from the token they already  held, but they are two separate assets and usually equity investors don’t want tokens as much as crypto investors and traders.

1479 2018-04-30 20:41:58 Ouch, ya that would place things on hold for a bit.  Hopefully we'd retrace to a higher low around 7,800.  Right towards the top of that box.
1480 2018-04-30 20:41:47 Insults now? Won’t get you far. Maybe you should read history yourself. EVERY fiat currency has died, ours will too. Crypto wasn’t here before though. The one single truth about ANY future is that you will live only what you can envision.

1503 2018-04-30 20:39:38 Keeping crypto trading very simple since I’m new. Limited analysis, watch volumes rise/fall for dipping coins. Take profits after 20-30% gain and volume starts to decrease. Repeat process. Nearly doubled in last 3 weeks.

1592 2018-04-30 20:29:28 Many appreciate it though. Bringing the negative things to light will help crypto in the long run. 

Pretending the issues aren't there and allowing them to fester will harm crypto. Allowing scams or shady activity in whatever form is one of the few things left that can slow us.

1600 2018-04-30 20:29:03 Agreed that's something I thought of while writing the post.
Honestly, most of the people having the problem of getting too hyped in a situation where they'd need my advice are people with little money.
5 BTC is a fortune for most, and most don't have liquidity problems.

1620 2018-04-30 20:27:11 Looks like they're doing it as a first use case. In my book that's good as they are following the Learn Startup Model.
1621 2018-04-30 20:26:50 So many #ICO promising the same thing. We dont need more ICOs we need to focus on scalability and mass adoption. If this keeps up there will be a crypto bubble after the fiat bubble pops.
1622 2018-04-30 20:26:41 What happened to crypto currency? I don’t see people talking about it anymore

1626 2018-04-30 20:26:21 The truly hilarious trend in crypto right now is for these stupid “tokenized security offerings” which are “regulatory compliant” in such reputable financial centers...like Lithuania.

Statism. You’re doing it wrong.

1635 2018-04-30 20:25:44 Haha what, I sold out of trx at .28>.31 after a .11>.14 entry. If you've been "holding" your trx after getting rekt by whales, maybe it's time for you to leave the crypto game?

1641 2018-04-30 20:25:22 Here is a pro crypto argument I haven't heard. Every other currency is tied to a geopolitical entity. You go someplace, you have to exchange what's in your pocket for the local coin. Crypto, on the other hand, is money without borders.

1682 2018-04-30 20:22:38 1)Youve got a point with reentering at support. However imo many people might then reenter under a certain uncertainty with fear of sudden movement. Taking partial exits allows you to not only reduce risk by reducing positions which are too big*

1737 2018-04-30 20:17:17 Paypal x-ceo called #bitcoin scam. Most were probably dismissive before adopting #btc. Kind of why banks did 180 on cryptos. Given his success, he has strong opinions. So does buffet. So did soros till he turned. Time will turn all of them to adopters. #crypto moon! #altcoins
1738 2018-04-30 20:17:15 Nice find. Looks like they're going down the right path by getting on as many exchanges as possible and getting their volume up. Are they focusing on developers forever or just as a first use case?

1765 2018-04-30 20:12:49 What’s this OcN coin airdrop all about.   Fine print and etc @AltOne_Crypto
1766 2018-04-30 20:12:36 I understand where you are coming from, however being able to prove who you are based on passwordless crypto across a network to anyone connected to that network is widely useful.
1767 2018-04-30 20:12:28 They do work in crypto. When the market is liquid. Right now BTC drops 300$ in a 1 min candle because of the gaps between the walls and fake buy walls.
So I'm pretty sure you or whoever is using them will have a hard time making money.
1768 2018-04-30 20:12:23 2) People are complaining that the @electroneum team are not coming out with any news or positive updates for a long time (which i can't disagree with at present) Please can you give us your opinion on this hardfork and what #etnx are planning?? I have held my tokens since ICO

1771 2018-04-30 20:12:12 The fact that Bitcoin has proven to stand up as a real currency, means that all crypto-currencies can also stand up as a real currencies too.  Bitcoin, the first crypto-currency, has pioneered the path for all crypto-currencies.
1772 2018-04-30 20:12:03 I don't mind partial exits but your target should've made sense in the first place.
If your take profit is based on a confluence of resistance and the coin pushes through and finds support there why not reenter a bit more expensive with way less risk?

1803 2018-04-30 20:08:55 What has worked well for me in my trading time is setting partial sell orders at targets, and if the setup presents itself scoop back in on dips and supports.

1849 2018-04-30 20:04:27 WHY WE BOUGHT STELLAR LUMENS. ((CRYPTO)) >>>  We realized that any crypto that succeeds must work closely with existing banks.  Kids creating crypto tokens on their laptop computers weren't going to be allowed to take over the worlds banking system. Reality.
1850 2018-04-30 20:04:19 cette stabilité depuis quelques jours est plutôt saine je trouve, ca prépare une belle montée par la suite.
1851 2018-04-30 20:04:18 And its ludicrous to think crypto is free from central banks; mining pools are central banks for cryptos. And China controls 80%+ of $BTC mining and 30%+ of $ETH. China is your crypto central bank.
1852 2018-04-30 20:04:11 Next stop...$3,000...

1856 2018-04-30 20:03:32 I was thinking about getting a lotus included in a japanese artwork sleeve im planning on getting lol its a beautiful flower, love it’s symbolism too
1857 2018-04-30 20:03:30 Ok, but the point is - if bitcoin / crypto didn't exist, how would they monetize the exploit? That is the central question - systems will always be hacked but they couldn't be easily extorted.  #crypto needs to address this (and other new crimes with ransome.) :)
1858 2018-04-30 20:03:22 There are many reasons for both sides...
My point is that you can state it like you did, its fully depending on the situation, sentiment and more.
You can protect your profits by setting a SL and move it up

1881 2018-04-30 20:00:43 I agree. Chances of a dump are usually higher than a pump in such a scenario. As you sold it probably means it pumped already.
1882 2018-04-30 20:00:42 i always try to leave enough that if it dumps, no harm, but if it pumps more then I can take advantage of that.

1970 2018-04-30 19:52:42 On the dark side, it's rampant on the junior stock exchanges where insiders coordinate market buying to inflate the price then sell/re-enter.

1988 2018-04-30 19:50:53 Crypto is taxed when you cash out and the company that creates it gets regulated so it is asking through taxation. They wont "stop" it. They will regulate it and it's already happening. Do you really think that all of the companies coming out with crypto arent controlled? Sorry

2120 2018-04-30 19:35:59 Dont really disagree but the evidence behind Satoshi Nakamoto as the Bitcoin creator is also just as flimsy. NSA who have a history in crypto vs some altruistic maths savant....i know which one seems more realistic to me.

2133 2018-04-30 19:34:36 The bear market of 2018 resulted in alot of people leaving crypto for a few months while the correction took place.

2155 2018-04-30 19:32:05 It's not a debate when the pretense is erroneous. Sirer is known to embellish, falsify information to emphasize his point and rely on his position at Cornell to establish his higher authority. Therefore, his opinion falls into the "fake news" category imo. Nothing to debate upon.

2164 2018-04-30 19:31:20 well, I think it's pretty obvious where the focus on crypto comes from.

2167 2018-04-30 19:30:59 Where ?
2168 2018-04-30 19:30:59 Please create your own crypto. It will afford you the resources to do what you’re about to do even faster 
2169 2018-04-30 19:30:34 Exactly what I was thinking when he said that. 

Take a look at the OTC Markets and stock pump and dumps in industries like Biotech. Stagnation + Scams.

Whereas crypto has scams but is full of some of the best teams and innovation on the planet.

ATM, BTC isn't of high liquidity, so tbh any EW right now is BS. (Liquidity not volume).
2173 2018-04-30 19:30:05 Today is a quiet day on the crypto markets. We don't see many days like this, and... It's obviously a calm before a storm. The only question is which direction it will head. I'm a perma bull, my gut says up. When $sys resumes trading after the fork will it fomo $dash style?

2180 2018-04-30 19:29:40 This is only the second alt pump I’ve seen, but given where we are in the BTC cycle, it feels healthier than Dec/Jan.  I’m mainly concerned with BTC spoiling the party, but I don’t see that happening until we get a serious look at breaking the 12k resistance.

2183 2018-04-30 19:29:38 Sure there are differences in vision. But you claim about "hijacking" is simply a matter of opinion that reasonable people can (and do) disagree about.
2184 2018-04-30 19:29:34 Do you believe that decentralized state channel atomic swaps between cryptos would further insulate blockchain from regulators? If such trading was to move to decentralized systems the only way to stop people's freedom to trade would be to ban all crypto including bitcoin.

2290 2018-04-30 19:20:25 I believe like any “call” it is simply a guess backed by history. Time will tell and getting positions as favorable as possible is the only preparedness we can take. Whether that is buying Alts on dips or loading up on $BTC is up to you.

2292 2018-04-30 19:20:18 Not so for large market makers. Poorly capitalized crypto market makers running some bots are at best second tier MMs. If it pays, you do it. A MM may also hedge at market.

2314 2018-04-30 19:18:25 For the first timers in #crypto:
1. Never take a personal loan to invest in crypto.
2. Never invest your crypto in mining schemes.
3. Keep your crypto in wallets and not in exchange.
4. Don't do trading in crypto unless you gain knowledge.
5. Read a lot.

2400 2018-04-30 19:09:15 Hhmmm that is not an exact science my man. To truly be delta neutral, you must long the underlying and find a way to get rid of delta, thereby earning the risk free rate. 

Not sure you can apply stoch calculus models to crypto. Although it moves in a GBM, crypto is too new

2449 2018-04-30 19:04:32 I'd like to suggest that you not fall into the common fallacy of expecting non-niche E2E crypto: if only we get usable key management. The far more severe problem with E2E is using previously received E2E email. MUAs just don't have the right interfaces, this is hard.
2450 2018-04-30 19:04:21 Indeed. r/btc is more representative of bitcoin since it is more about free speech, sharing innovative ideas, and working together to create solutions. r/bitcoin is entirely opposite since this is where all of the censorship occurs.

Now the different crypto communities should decide- do they prefer a fast network which allows anyone to join, mine, verify, and transact, or a network which **forces** miners to co-locate and coordinate

I think the less miner coordination the better, you?

2664 2018-04-30 18:40:28 I don't believe in bit coin or other crypto currencies because of a lack of
intrinsic value.  Gold and Silver has been considered currency for over five thousand years.

2709 2018-04-30 18:36:20 Yes you're correct that "Tech evolves." That's why OUTDATED 9 YEAR OLD TECH BTC has EVOLVED & we now have new replacement technology w/innovation now seen in BCH to make it the coin with EVERYTHING needed to replace BTC & more. 
Bitcoin as Cash is Bitcoin. "BITCOIN IS EVOLUTION"
2710 2018-04-30 18:36:17 I feel that crypto goes some way in righting the wrong towards developers who were integral in creating the internet and software as we know it. No one will ever say that these dev's didn't get the payment they deserved. 

I hope all open source devs are seizing their comeuppance
2711 2018-04-30 18:36:03 Well if that's the case why would you sell MAN when an exchange listing is immenent? Instead of buying a shitty pension platform that all the useless shillers on twitter have been pumping

2810 2018-04-30 18:26:40 Poor analogy. Most folks tell time via phone/smart watch/computer, all of which sync to master servers via NTP. In crypto terms this is analogous to a thin client, not a full node. Individuals do not need an atomic clock on their wrist nor do they need a full node.

2818 2018-04-30 18:25:25 Want to know how to best prepare yourself for this #altseason? Go back to #crypto twitter this time last year and study the trends, topics and charts - thats how to put yourself ahead of the rest.

2821 2018-04-30 18:25:19 Used to be a big fan, still a small bag holder. It’s just a testnet.
2822 2018-04-30 18:25:15 One thing #crypto has taught me:  How dumb “smart people” can be. I don’t care about your MBA or your PhD or any credentials that make your opinion more valid than any others. The amount of gross incompetence from the “intellectuals” is eye opening to say the least.
2823 2018-04-30 18:25:10 hands down you and @crypto_rand have taught me the most, thank you
2824 2018-04-30 18:25:02 How many coins you have?
2825 2018-04-30 18:24:46 Use Trezor or ledger nano s cold storage device. Never keep crypto on online devices.
2826 2018-04-30 18:24:45 You’re right, fraud is hijacking a twitter account and website, and using them as propaganda tools in order to confuse the crypto community and elicit financial gains

Over the past year, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have skyrocketed to become the bread and butter for crypto-based startups looking to raise funds from investors.
2842 2018-04-30 18:23:47 I honestly think with the global retail nature of crypto, current company evaluation models will miss the mark on crypto assets. What would the market cap for @Tesla be if everyone in the world can invest in it through a market with minimal barriers to entry??

2908 2018-04-30 18:17:27 True, and I think the more democratized funding of crypto startups helps, but VCs and PE need to look at the profiles of those they fund. Diversity means age as well as gender and cultural affiliations

2965 2018-04-30 18:12:16 Genuinely curious... Are there other markets with well known investors (e.g. @PeterSchiff @BillHarris_PC & Buffett) who can be so hugely wrong about investments such as #bitcoin & #Crypto for >5 yrs & still be spouting the same arguments? 

Seems like they just want it to fail!

2986 2018-04-30 18:09:50 Seems like a lot of work. I like larger positions and less micro managing (chances to miscalculate on short term volatility). But I'm also not a hodl fan at all either. I trade stages of cycles with trends/channels to support them most times.

2996 2018-04-30 18:09:06 Some people are going to school trying to aquire certitude and not knowledge. If you do "this", than "that" will happen, thats all they want to know, thats how you pass the test. This are basicly the ones who are troubled even after achieving a degree.
2997 2018-04-30 18:08:54 聞いてないけど？？
2998 2018-04-30 18:08:52 細かい額のビットコインを大量に受け取っていると（例えば，1時間ごとに自動受信する形のハイプで）「過去に受信した多くの小規模な決済を統合する必要」のために，送金手数料があとで多額になる可能性があるような気がします。
2999 2018-04-30 18:08:51 $XRP increase? what % of the market was $XRP then compared to now?
3000 2018-04-30 18:08:36 Stupid question but what do you mean by close?  Is t crypto 24/7?
3001 2018-04-30 18:08:20 I Guess no one has seen shit this time :)
3002 2018-04-30 18:08:17 It is warranted they actual hold it, at that time bitcoin was nothing, just a geek game, it had no value, they are the only pioneers. Total different situation is when crypto is a thing people launch projects already holding huge stashes without any real economical input or risk.
3003 2018-04-30 18:08:04 $IFXY is very thin, could see a major breakout. $ELTZ is the next diamond in the rough, here is your chance. #oil #crypto
3004 2018-04-30 18:08:01 pretty disturbing that the leader of a top10 crypto currency doesnt even know how nodes work in relation to miners

3009 2018-04-30 18:07:49 Not too exited about that. Some people don't know that it goes in cost of their own electricity bill and hardware depreciation. Also, I truly assume they will keep some of the mined crypto.
3010 2018-04-30 18:07:40 people just like to say tron.
3011 2018-04-30 18:07:37 @MichaelSuppo Use @get_delta Delta App, far more superior with lots of functions. You can add custom token and when it hits exchanges merge it with actual token and keep track of your investment!
3012 2018-04-30 18:07:30 As the number of orders on the platform increases, the number of secure transactions grows. Develop[crypto] should purchase a growing quantity of tokens to keep reserving them. The demand is constantly increasing. @devcrypt_io

3017 2018-04-30 18:07:07 #photochain
Photochain uses blockchain technology to rediscover photos around buyers and sellers. most crypto investors have been paying attention to this #photochain because experienced team members and their project plans must use a very useful blockchain technology!
3018 2018-04-30 18:07:05 The other the public doesn't know is that the huge increase in the money supply since 2008 was due to a huge decrease in "velocity of money". If we'd been on a gold standard (or fixed crypto standard) prices would have dived horribly and we'd have 50% unemployment now with riots.
3019 2018-04-30 18:07:02 Why?
3020 2018-04-30 18:07:01 I stay on this money grind. Microsoft not even my primary job anymore. I've made more money in $Crypto than 2 annual salaries.

3097 2018-04-30 17:58:57 You have to understand the importance of adoption as this gives Crypto real world use in both technology via block chain and currency, ultimately being accepted as a form of payment. The question is not if it will happen, but more so when it will happen. We have this influence.

3106 2018-04-30 17:57:53 If you read my article, I’m leaning bullish short-term.  It’s not a long term large bag for me though.

I picked some up about two weeks ago and will sell most of it when she pumps.

3111 2018-04-30 17:57:20 $TFD is one of the few projects that incorporated #blockchain and crypto into a pre-existing business model. Most promise future business activity, while TFD has been up and running for years.

3123 2018-04-30 17:55:52 I'd rather they focussed on becoming a challenger bank and add direct debit and faster payments than marginally improving their crypto offering.

3139 2018-04-30 17:54:33 Which video (source)
 i know he's mentioned a few times over the last two months Bitcoin could be going up, the words "Double bubble" was used on twitter telegram and even in an interview on CNBC crypto trader.

I never once heard "Bitcoin is dying"
3140 2018-04-30 17:54:18 also, roll-your-own-crypto is not always a bad thing, if #devs are competent and smart. 
as a matter of fact NSA rolled their own #crypto -- is that stuff reliable? I don't think so.
3141 2018-04-30 17:54:09 Indians are mostly here JUST for money. An average crypto trader doesn't even know what smart contracts are. Psychologically makes them feel better to hold many coins than fraction of a coin.
3142 2018-04-30 17:53:59 Such a good idea. Bags packed.
3143 2018-04-30 17:53:47 Wonder if the #cryprtoOG ever miss the fun days of crypto when you didnt know what was going to happen next ?

3146 2018-04-30 17:53:30 I agree completely! Their live settlement system is quite impressive! However, I believe that their centralised nature is conflicting with the fundamental properties of being a crypto currency! Your thoughts?
3147 2018-04-30 17:53:28 lol same rumours as the dec/jan pump

3155 2018-04-30 17:51:58 I will truly accept $BTC when the devs get off of that wacky #elliptic #curve #crypto. then it will be a safe asset. 
now it's just a guessing game, when will someone cracc the lame NSA stuff.
3156 2018-04-30 17:51:30 cc @Riana_Crypto ?

3162 2018-04-30 17:51:07 Prediction: every #crypto governance system being proposed today will fail. It is impossible to design a top down working system. The governance model that succeeds will emerge organically bottom up from a project never explicitly focused on governance.

3233 2018-04-30 17:42:26 I downloaded the mac os wallet but its not even connecting for me to sync the wallet, any ideas why? Would appreciate any help.
3234 2018-04-30 17:42:18 #BitRewards   A worthy project. I propose to look at the market right now, on new technologies and ideas for this company,

3237 2018-04-30 17:41:47 Check out Monero @NickJFuentes. it's the only private, untraceable, fungible crypto. Because Bitcoin isn't exchanges can block you or even not allow "tainted coins".

3239 2018-04-30 17:41:38 I mean, if TRX gets to $5 it'd have a market cap of $300bn (3/4 of current crypto cap), and $50 is basically impossible.
3240 2018-04-30 17:41:37 when you're selling your position someone is on the opposite end of this trade buying -- a valuable question to ask yourself is what does this person understand that I don't.

3245 2018-04-30 17:40:47 モスコミュール
3246 2018-04-30 17:40:47 How does that work on the vendor side though. They need to keep track of transactions coming in from different crypto, and relate them back to actual sales.

I think that there is a need for back end tracking as well, that I haven’t seen yet, and a crawler to make it easy.
3247 2018-04-30 17:40:47 So you call for centralization? You want to be on the same time or should i say dooms day clock. You should sell your crypto and transfer to the central banks time :)

3268 2018-04-30 17:38:48 The right criticism would have been to say I was too narrowly defining the potential sources of knowledge, which is correct and I thank you for pointing that out. My statements on intelligence are still valid tho and not substantially different from what you said.
3269 2018-04-30 17:38:44 The Japanese financial regulator forbids #crypto exchanges to conduct operations with #Monero (XMR), #Dash (DASH), #Zcash (ZEC) and other cryptocurrencies.

#AIREXE exchange #ICO is open. Registration and verification is started.

3351 2018-04-30 17:30:48 For assets that are native to the chain that's operating the exchange, you don't need an IOU. For foreign crypto assets, you need something to hold the foreign assets, but that can be a federation that uses distributed trust. There's still a threat that the federation just stops.

3377 2018-04-30 17:28:42 Fraud is misrepresenting an alt-coin as bitcoin leading users to a loss of funds. Also, launching a hostile hardfork that doesn't change the address format also leading to a loss of users funds. You can play semantic games all you want but bcash is not bitcoin. Period. Full stop.

3383 2018-04-30 17:28:12 TRON $TRX a beau être un shit coin, ses performances sont assez hallucinantes, mon plan est de le HODL sur plusieurs années, ou jusqu’à ce qu’il atteigne $1,5.

3384 2018-04-30 17:28:09 They will have some excuse like "processing crypto is difficult and requires manual work that we do not have resources for". The real reason is people who go to "blockchain" events nowadays do not have hot wallets and do not use cryptocurrency apart from "trading" on exchanges.

6. Wait for next FOMO

3593 2018-04-30 17:04:49 @jerome_corsi I suggest you begin to accept crypto currency donations. Far more valuable. Consider #bitcoin , #litecoin and #ethereum for starters #MAGA
3594 2018-04-30 17:04:25 The current #crypto valuation is the same as the inflation-adjusted NASDAQ in 1974. We have seen nothing yet.

3597 2018-04-30 17:04:15 Oui je m'étais trompé dans mon graphique la dernière fois. C'est bon maintenant je pense (ce n'est pas celui actualisé d'aujourd'hui)
3598 2018-04-30 17:04:12 Maybe bitcoin was created by a time traveler from the future who wanted to keep AI busy mining crypto instead of killing all humans.
3599 2018-04-30 17:04:09 The 4th and final video digs deep into the use case of Blockchain and Crypto within the @Hotel_Coin ecosystem and it is super dynamic, with a strong market opportunity.
3600 2018-04-30 17:03:59 Or we're all looking at the same chart and there's a couple pretty obvious things going on
3601 2018-04-30 17:03:45 #trx #tron $trx so I am sure most people have heard buy the rumor sell the news. If thats the case, we have more then a month of trx rising to potentially .25-.30 before #mainnet is active. Here is the time to jump on board and make a nice investment. #cryptocurrency #Crypto
3602 2018-04-30 17:03:33 On today's @badcrypto / what we experiencing today with crypto are people buying their first $bcash or $monero and this is the equivalent of plantation workers getting their first bank accounts. IMF terrified. 
Interesting point

3605 2018-04-30 17:03:27 if people are telling you theyre getting some insane multiple on newly released coins chances are theyre giving you information that could jeopardize their syndicate.
3606 2018-04-30 17:03:24 Crypto Currency seems to be a pretty new thing. Everyone seems to be trying it. Seems a little complicated & risky for my tastes though

3610 2018-04-30 17:03:01 Maybe they watched what the NSA did to crypto and network protocols over the last few decades and learned a few lessons
3611 2018-04-30 17:02:42 Of course it is... there’s news of another shitcoin airdrop.

I half wonder if ZCL isn’t overbought by some whale/ group who keeps pumping it with useless crap, and making tons off the dumps!

3650 2018-04-30 16:59:42 What if I told you there was a place that already has 20+ #Bitcoin ATMs and attracts millions of visitors a year from all over the world? Wouldn’t that be an ideal place to spread the word of #crypto?
3651 2018-04-30 16:59:40 Did bittrex ever fully reopen registrations? That'd probably help with a comeback. Especially with the coins u can only really get on bittrex (if ur looking for bigger orders)

3674 2018-04-30 16:57:18 Your future is in your hands...

Unless you're a crypto trader, then your future is in your ability to express to everyone you know what cryptocurrency is, why it's important and how they can get it and spend it.
3675 2018-04-30 16:57:18 there’s this whole network of pseudo oppositions between crypto-Rojavist crypto-Trot PSL and openly Rojavist “Maoist” Red Guards Austin / Anarchist IGD etc that we have to be wary about

3677 2018-04-30 16:57:11 I think @CoinText is a very important gateway towards crypto use & adoption.  

So you have an important choice to make:

Will you champion $BCH's goal to become global money that frees the world, strengthening it's position, or will you divert attention away from it?

3698 2018-04-30 16:54:33 There are probably a lot of reasons to dislike Bittrex, but I think that's probably more on Rhett and compay than on Trex..
3699 2018-04-30 16:54:15 What is your average entry? You have to keep in mind that the fiat price increased by the factor 10,000 within a year. This is not sustainable, not even in crypto. Obviously it had to go down from its all time high. It is still insanely higher than mid 2017.
3700 2018-04-30 16:54:12 Nah
3701 2018-04-30 16:54:08 Next step - accepting crypto as donations
3702 2018-04-30 16:54:01 If you have not noticed the whole crypto market is a bit pump and dump. If you have ever traded forex or stocks, movements there like 10% are something huge but in crypto you can see 50-100% and this is normal here. So if you bought the top and you lost it is your fault!

3743 2018-04-30 16:48:09 What if 2018 is the collapse of the USD?  

TBC is the answer for the average person, regardless of what happens to the USD!

3855 2018-04-30 16:35:38 Iota is awesome. You get trinary logic thrown in for free with your home brewed crypto primitives.
3856 2018-04-30 16:35:29 I'd say the same thing about those who get emotional about particular coins. I don't believe there will be one crypto to rule them all. Consider Europe before the Euro. The market can handle some diversity.

3858 2018-04-30 16:35:12 Crypto isn’t asking for permission from governments. If the government could stop it, they would have.The government couldnt even stop people drinking booze during prohibition, failed to stop “terror”, and failed to stop drugs.theyre useless at everything except hurting people.
3859 2018-04-30 16:35:11 Agreed. When I jumped into crypto I had this feeling I missed the bus a bit. Tron among some other great alts is the next wave  and will get a taste of what other have had.

3862 2018-04-30 16:34:58 Yes, but this is not a 1 day pump. Go in, stay in, and be patient. Thats how you make money in the field.
3863 2018-04-30 16:34:53 Does anyone else agree that the biggest danger to 

$zcash and $monero 

Is that they're TOO private? 

I think the weaker exchanges and the stronger regulators (when regulation arrives) will hit them hard.

I have watched this stock be hammered by day traders for months! It’s foundation is finally built to grow, looking strong and thin. Does anyone know how much money Crypto exchanges make?!? Once you find that out you’ll own this as-well.

Considering the move-out of crypto exchanges from China last year, this could be a signal that Chinese government is changing their position. #blockchain #cryptocurreny #crypto

3981 2018-04-30 16:23:26 Corrections are the time to "plant the seed" deeper. Been waiting on this for some time now 
3982 2018-04-30 16:23:25 Such a great way to use something that a lot of the general public views as "a currency for illegal activity". This can definitely help bring crypto into the spotlight as a use for doing good things.

4095 2018-04-30 16:14:54 The problem is that not all things that tend to slow government down are net problems. Crypto is going to shit right now, precisely because without oversight people are free to serve their own interests as aggressively as they want, regardless of what the means for everyone else

4102 2018-04-30 16:14:03 We can build parallel crypto systems initially & demonstrate their superiority over antiquated systems which would help drive demand for their implementation. #Bitcoin is already doing this with remittances & global banking, but could easily be applied to gov budgets & elections.
4103 2018-04-30 16:14:03 This coin literally does nothing and is valued in the billions. It is what is wrong with crypto. Long live the real coins that will change the world and let all the others including Tron go down in history as what they really are...SCAMS

4150 2018-04-30 16:10:10 Japanese regulators have reportedly considered restrictions on privacy coins like Monero & ZCash.

Regulators once wanted to ban the use of encryption, but now it is considered a best practice. Privacy elements of crypto will likely follow same path.

4179 2018-04-30 16:08:13 Most will avoid it if they charge 1.5% for sending crypto anyway.

Revolut works good for a bank card etc (although Monzo is superior just now), however I feel the crypto "features" are just to allow some exposure to price movements.

Jimmy, if there is one crypto currency that can disrupt visa, which would it be?
4205 2018-04-30 16:06:08 The use of Blockchain will allow the European Crypto Bank to seriously simplify the processes of the banking information infrastructure. The project team achieved high results, significant cost reduction and increased efficiency of banking operations. @EuropeanCryptoB
4206 2018-04-30 16:06:08 No, but he's quoting Martin Luther King...

My point is that if you're going to quote someone's ideology, you should best depict it accurately.
4207 2018-04-30 16:06:04 Maybe they started a little unsound, but great marketing got them lots of money and with that money they might actually build a succesful project.. thats crypto

4209 2018-04-30 16:05:57 Oh yeah, another lesson in the books --> Patience, something a lot of ppl dont have, including me sometimes
4210 2018-04-30 16:05:55 This is one area I think cryptocurrencies are going to show promise because they allow you to create a financial system outside of slow governments. If someone figures out how to do a basic income inside of a crypto, and enough people buy into it... It could work in our lifetime.
4211 2018-04-30 16:05:48 Looking at TRX market cap then 10x coming for OCN in a bull run

4213 2018-04-30 16:05:46 @arrington Can you please build/acquire a company that would destroy coinbase. thanks we need we need a bigger outlet to purchase Crypto with fiat.
4214 2018-04-30 16:05:33 It's going to be the biggest wealth/power shift since the creation of the stock market in early 1600's. I'd also go as far as to say governments that don't have the clearing system on a blockchain will face being under funded from crypto tax evasion.
4215 2018-04-30 16:05:30 This has been my running hypothesis for a few years now—crypto booms/busts are just another CB tool to inflate/deflate fiat money supply.
4216 2018-04-30 16:05:26 Fintech will lead the way.

4254 2018-04-30 16:01:30 I think there's a gap for an audience that's unlikely to deploy crypto in practice, but would benefit by learning about how the primitives fit together, what they give you, and where you'd use them.

4354 2018-04-30 15:51:11 If crypto has taught us anything it’s that some people will apply value to things that other people see as valueless. Most people do not value their data but others (big governments ad agencies, census groups, investors, journalists, etc.) place a lot of value on this data.

4363 2018-04-30 15:50:03 The paradox of being an influencer in this space is if you don't hold the coins you support, people question whether you really support it or not. If you do hold the coins, you get accused of pumping your own bags. #crypto #thestruggleisreal

4372 2018-04-30 15:49:21 I think pressure on inflationary, and unaccountable, fiat systems, as well as being forced to compete w cryptos more as adoption escalates, will devalue fiat to the point of govs being forced to adopt their own crypto, or relinquish control completely to global crypto.

4376 2018-04-30 15:49:13 The stock market on wall street is a gamble. Any day bad news could hit, a war, terror, bad news out of DC, rates rising, and the whole thing could tank. The markets have been on a steady dive since the end of January. While crypto is rising.

4393 2018-04-30 15:47:30 I think that nations & states will be incentivized to create their own crypto currencies to allow tax payments & gov spending to be transparent, and more efficient. I think we see this start with countries competing w dollar 1st, but it will eventually be standard for all.

4398 2018-04-30 15:46:37 They'll regulate crypto like they regulate precious metals.
4399 2018-04-30 15:46:34 The fact that late stage companies are valued at $500 billion and crypto market is at $450 Billion, means that we're valuing early stage projects much more than those with paying clients and proves use cases

4874 2018-04-30 14:59:44 Rodgers has already said that what rangers do is irrelevant to him. They are not celtics most difficult opponents on the pitch now and are a million miles away from us on and off the pitch. He is here because he loves Celtic and that’s it.

5012 2018-04-30 14:47:33 Don't you think these regs are going to eventually drive crypto traders to unrestricted decentralized exchanges? Traders will gravitate (extremely quickly) to the exchanges that are the most free & with the most robust spread of tokens. Binance rose to No. 1 in months bc of this.

5016 2018-04-30 14:47:17 3/ Notably, the proposed rules look at "spot crypto asset activities, including exchanges, custodians and other intermediaries, to be undertaken in the financial free zone of the emirate."
5017 2018-04-30 14:47:17 Wife all about these issues. Disturbing things we’ve been made privy to via our Daughter’s tragedy leads me to believe medical cartels have been reduced to agents for mass crypto-genocide on the horizon. Life in technologically advanced captivity is becoming outright incarcerate.

5027 2018-04-30 14:46:23 right, so according to you, all crypto is centralized - as there will always be a single party that has more money or holds more than another - unless everyone gets an equal share and is not allowed to trade it, it will be decentralized - Are you stupid or just a troll?
5028 2018-04-30 14:46:22 $LTC volume spike. 943 coin print at $150.79....
5029 2018-04-30 14:46:22 Also - the classic case of the Crypto conversation where the digging and discussion only starts when momentum gained as people take note. Like Ripple's run to $3 +... the convo around that turned mainly negative. Agreed re transparency though!

5122 2018-04-30 14:36:47 Without privacy/fungibility, the purpose of crypto is lost. Time to enact freedom and ignore the criminal syndicates that call themselves "Legal entities", Governments, Banks, Corporations. TENDER FOR LAW, is what Fiat is... Crypto, they have zero jurasdiction.

5156 2018-04-30 14:33:55 I've found another tweak to encourage my profit-taking - slightly oversize bags that I am very keen on.  If you use a standard size of bag then putting more in than you are comfortable with is a good way to ensure you take some (the "extra") out when it goes up a bit.

5164 2018-04-30 14:33:23 you are right about the rules. I believe these rules will come and that is good. but that will come with disadvantages as well. less profits for instance, and that is the main reason why many investors, big or small, are involved in #crypto in the first place.

5174 2018-04-30 14:32:47 All these regs are going to drive crypto traders to decentralized exchanges that carry no restrictions. Traders will gravitate (extremely quickly) to the exchange that is the most free & with the most robust spread of tokens. Binance became No. 1 in months bc of this.

5209 2018-04-30 14:29:36 Volume is a leading indicator in crypto as it precedes price increases. However I don't know whether that's a natural markets phenomenon or because of the prevalance of whales accumulating before pumping.

5215 2018-04-30 14:29:13 The key word is 'strong' . Attendances are up despite them being garbage.

There was no clamour for a 'strong' celtic then!
5216 2018-04-30 14:28:58 Even if people knew deeply what Bitcoin is, tech is unpredictable and ever changing with new innovations, which makes it nearly impossible to have any idea of what the future holds with any certainty. People are betting in crypto, picking the few that would last to the end.

5492 2018-04-30 14:03:42 The market is a limbo. When @AngeloBTC says 14k soon (in months) and @ToneVays @Crypto_Core says no bullish senario until you cross 12-13k btc. Unsubscribe anyone who says we are in a bull market or at least don’t invest based on them. #crypto #btcusd #ada #eth#eos

5503 2018-04-30 14:02:15 Stock markets and forex at least have rules. And blatant types of manipulation are criminally punished. Here, in crypto, they are totally unhinged. Yes, I have my picks, nothing changed but to comment on this market as if "nothing wrong" and expect real "moves" from alts...

#IOTA is going to be central to infrastructural energy distribution in the near future; it is only logical that energy-both from and to the grid-be monetized via micro transactions in a way only it can deliver.
5608 2018-04-30 13:53:33 in one of satoshi's posts he mentions he thought btc would not be able to scale properly in a world in hyper-bitcoinization and mentioned another coin would probably be made to support it.  this is where litecoins creator says he wants to take place in, as a supporter.

5717 2018-04-30 13:42:09 They wouldn't be allowed to cover it. The news has a narrative and anything that is bad for the clintons is not in the plan. That's why they won't talk about all the child sex trafficking that is being exposed.
5718 2018-04-30 13:42:04 Because you are sending a massage just like a transaction. It's 1 coin for now. Dynamic fees are coming in the next upgrade so fees for this will be like .0001 burstcoin or less. Potentially even free.

6161 2018-04-30 12:48:32 Hi $crypto, a while ago I bought some (not many, don't worry) $RISE to tag along for the interlet and chipz airdrop. Never got the airdropped tokens obviously, but I was wondering if anyone has suggestions what to do with my small bag ;-)
6162 2018-04-30 12:48:06 What makes crypto better is that it's not governed by a centralized body that acts in it's own self-interest. What the hell were they thinking giving more rope to hang themselves with?
6163 2018-04-30 12:48:01 1/ In just one century we transitioned through 1) a corporation age 2) a startup ecosystem age and 3) the crypto ecosystem age. Each is its own superorganism with a different structure of the underlying network.
6164 2018-04-30 12:47:51 Why do you suddenly support tokenism?

If you rewind to its last high of 7000sats, it was falling for 2 weeks and lost over 30% of its price before this 5 day pump. I think its a risky buy now.

6265 2018-04-30 12:36:22 BTC is divisible by 18 decimals.

6403 2018-04-30 12:19:28 今後、仮想通貨市場が
どのようになっていくのか
仮想通貨で億万長者を目指すのであれば

各国の情報などもしっかり把握して
今後の見通しを立てていきましょう。

この現状を見ますと
きっとまだまだ仮想通貨は
成長し続けていくといえるでしょう。

6406 2018-04-30 12:19:09 既に
ブラジル、ベネズエラ
ドバイ、エストニアなどは
独自通貨の発行が進められています。

アメリカ、カナダ、シンガポール、イギリス
フランス、ドイツ
日本でも政府が主体となり

独自の仮想通貨発行を
検討段階だといわれているため
各国が独自の仮想通貨発行に
次々と身を乗り出している現状。
6407 2018-04-30 12:18:39 クリプトルーブルは
完全に政府管理課で発行され
管理される予定となっています。

そして2018年7月頃に
クリプトルーブルのプロジェクトが
正式に発表される予定となっています。

ロシアはこの仮想通貨を通して
経済的にも、技術的にも国際的にも国益を高めることが
出来るだろうといわれています。

6416 2018-04-30 12:18:02 しかし
仮想通貨の市場が急激に拡大し
悪用されるリスクから計画は延期。

その間、ロシアでは仮想通貨取引や

しかし、
1月25日に遂にクリプトルーブルは
公式な決済手段として
導入される法案が提出。

ロシアはいよいよ仮想通貨関連に
身を乗り出しました。

6570 2018-04-30 11:59:38 Crypto Tip:

If you’re luck enough to find an altcoin gem...

1) under $1B market cap.

2) the 24hr volume is around 3-4%.

3) the dev team is respected & trustworthy. 

4) HASN’T been shilled on twitter by crypto ‘gurus’ yet.

Then you’re on your way 50-100x returns.

6593 2018-04-30 11:58:12 Downside is far worse than $6k. If it dips down below or more $5 or $4k, mining not only becomes pointless but unprofitable in a majority of regions, triggering sell offs, a slow network, a freefall. No wonder it was so desperately held above that level.

Key Drivers

At least when they use @CoinText it's a start to crypto adoption leading the consumers demanding merchants to adoption of crypto.

6746 2018-04-30 11:33:28 "Sad" but true : The coins with the best marketing and the best pumpers are often the biggest gainers in crypto. Signs of an immature market mostly composed of retail investors rather than institutionnal ones.

6767 2018-04-30 11:30:15 New traders dabbling with Crypto are probably thinking its normal for markets to move 10 to 15% in a day. 
Believe me, its not normal & while coins might be lighting up in your eyes, there will soon be tears instead if you don't use #riskmanagement.

6773 2018-04-30 11:29:38 Hmmm it's the thought process I had at the start...but holding through a 70% correction seems to be illogical, unless of course you bought lower than that in the first place - I know what you mean though, solid projects long-term and a % to swing around here and there short-term

6792 2018-04-30 11:26:33 It's brilliant to put a comedian up to mock the crypto-fascists and overt racists in the White House. Any professional liar like @PressSec can stand a little heat or get out of the kitchen. Trump calls people names & grabs genitalia, and you call the comedian indecent?

6795 2018-04-30 11:26:22 Another way of looking at it is he's taking a risk on real estate, agricultural land and gold. If fiat and $crypto crash I think think it's a better bet to have an internationally diversified portfolio of the above. #JustSayin

6870 2018-04-30 11:16:16 Crypto Tip:

If you’re luck enough to find an altcoin gem...

1) under $1B market cap.

2) the 24hr volume is around 3-4%.

3) the dev team is respected & trustworthy. 

4) HASN’T been shilled on twitter by crypto ‘gurus’ yet.

Then you’re on your way 50-100x returns.

6896 2018-04-30 11:12:30 Passion is great, hard work & results is usually the output of that. Delicate dance between building something for personal growth, a product of value to many, and solutions to problems that don't exist. Crypto winter (2014 - 2016) experienced a throng of this IMO!

6939 2018-04-30 11:06:38 There is this ecosystem of wealth management we call the financial system, and we are beholden to it in our current state. However, when that system evolves the movement of a great amount of wealth from fiat institutions into #crypto will take place. This evolution will be slow.

7014 2018-04-30 10:58:11 Het zijn óf crypto-marxistische clichés, óf het is ondoorgrondelijk. Je kan het niet allebei tegelijk hebben. Een Soreliaanse mythe is het politiek gebruik van mythes zoals dat beschreven is door George Sorel, om het volk te mobiliseren en tegenstellingen op scherp te zetten.

7027 2018-04-30 10:55:54 you answered your own question there. The higher the market cap the more volume you need to move the price (more coins, thicker books). That's exactly why you must consider it, since the higher up you go, the lower the potential upside is.

7152 2018-04-30 10:38:06 If memory serves me well it was as soon as January 2009 when one of first miners did the math and came with 10 mil. USD per 1 BTC should the BTC replace fiat money globally.

7167 2018-04-30 10:34:28 Bearish feel from $BTC at the moment, honestly this is a no trade zone. If we failed to go back at 9.3-9.4k, the bull will be running out of steam and a drop to 8.9k ish is highly. Be careful my crypto friends, always remember risk reward ratio. If it drops, hey cheap alts again

7227 2018-04-30 10:26:50 too early to tell
7228 2018-04-30 10:26:36 I’d argue there’s a correlation between inflation and security. More inflation incentivizes more miners/stakers to secure the network.

7274 2018-04-30 10:19:52 True, but nobody knows at this point how the crypto space will play out. Until then I am rooting for every project in the industry that tries to innovate. That's what I don't get about all the infighting and coin bashing.

7472 2018-04-30 09:49:16 I'm not worried about short-term price driven by speculation. I'm focused on long-term organic growth & adoption. Everyone is jumping ship from BTC & over to BCH. BTC is 9 years old and BCH is only 9 months. Wait until the first upgrade 5/15 & BCH's potential will be unleashed.

7596 2018-04-30 09:29:27 dommage, j'aurai aimé faire un event crypto à @LeContainer et diffuser la conf. Ce sera pour une prochaine fois peut-être ;)

7601 2018-04-30 09:28:24 On rev you don't buy crypto, even centralised monstrosities like XRP, you simply buy their equivalent of a CFD.  You can't add to your balance from a real crypto wallet and you can't move out. Basically they've opened up the option to gamble on price movement in a banking app.

7619 2018-04-30 09:25:21 Sold it after their launch when price didn't really move. I was expecting it would take a lot of time. It was more a mid term hodl. Took my profit and played some other short term swings. Price tanked after my sell but is higher meanwhile.

7638 2018-04-30 09:22:02 So, do we need cryptocurrency or blockchain? I heard a lot of critique from generation X and baby boomers that crypto is the biggest scam and only exists because of millennials desire to gamble using credit cards to buy crypto. I don't agree but they have power to play music.
7639 2018-04-30 09:21:42 Üstat Merhaba Bir silkelenme bekliyor musun? BTC de bekliyroum ne olur ne olmaz
7640 2018-04-30 09:21:34 LOL. Yeah, that's often the case when money is involved. That's why I like to laugh at all the crypto-currency blockheads, although some are even more laughable than others.
7641 2018-04-30 09:21:32 most important thing in #crypto trading is to avoid being too greedy, better to exit early and make a profit than holding the bags when there is a big retracement. HODL is probably the worse piece of advice ever given.
7642 2018-04-30 09:21:31 Tend to agree tbh, however EToro made me 100k so I can’t really complain. Revolut seem to have much more crypto integration coming. They have a new debit card coming in a few month which give cash back as Crypto. They are also looking at transfers on future releases.
7643 2018-04-30 09:21:30 I need to get more money into crypto market.

So many good trading oppurtinities . 

I have no account on @Huobi_Pro and I see there amazing trades.

Something I must have. 
7644 2018-04-30 09:20:43 Longest chain and proof of work (or alternativly POS) is what's making BTC or any other crypto safe and funciton. In DECENTRALIZED system, it's ONLY way to proof what is what. PoW and chain data, only thing that matters.

7815 2018-04-30 08:51:52 Of course , crypto currencies are appreciating assets themselves . Let’s say 350k worth of ETH to buy the house and next week ETH flies up $100 dollars . I basically gave them 125% of the asking price . Hypothetically speaking.

7824 2018-04-30 08:49:52 I say it too often to mates around me. Take profits not matter how small, 10%/20%/30%. Understand the people you are playing with. Look at your % rather than your $ gain. If you had 100k down and got 10% in a day, you best believe you are taking 10k.

7830 2018-04-30 08:48:22 Interesting to read this thread of short term day traders. 

Long term hold of crypto is the way to go. You can stay up all night and swing/gamble your money away based on curvatures of graphs OR you can go all in on a coin like #trx, get some sleep and prosper in 5 years.

7831 2018-04-30 08:48:14 Bitcoin is the first decentralized crypto-currency and has completely become “Market-Driven” on its pricing.  While there still is up to a 10% margin of arbitration between the Bitcoin Exchanges worldwide, generally the “Markets” drive the price of Bitcoin up and down.

7837 2018-04-30 08:46:56 Yeah. It was #OAX from @TheBPSignal PnD. Interestingly #SNGLS also pumped at the same time in similar volume and price change. Any thoughts?
7838 2018-04-30 08:46:31 of course
7839 2018-04-30 08:45:56 Slowly but surely you becoming my favourite Crypto Youtuber. Keep the good work Ivan! Well done.
7840 2018-04-30 08:45:45 I’ve always found @XGOXCOIN to be a highly speculative coin. Low sat price and no important use as a gaming coin. It looks like things are changing however! This might be one of those low volume gems on cryptopia. Will look into it and tweet again today #xgox #crypto #cryptopia
7841 2018-04-30 08:45:44 Oui mais fais gaffe, les comploteurs crypto-capitalistes vont t'empêcher de te faire rembourser par la sécu (ce qui est, clairement, de la persécution digne des pires heures de notre histoire).

7849 2018-04-30 08:45:17 I'd assume this is also related to your investment plan long vs short term coupled with any tax liabilities that may apply by making that move -> if you can absorb the drop long-term probably doesn't matter really

7891 2018-04-30 08:36:02 Perhaps for the holders @JoelKatz could have worded it slightly different: "primary duty to shareholders secondary to holders" but on a business level his statement is correct. Taking care of the fiduciary duty automatically takes care of the rest of the holders.

7896 2018-04-30 08:35:33 It takes getting used to, Kraken. The engine is pretty shitty idd, but FIAT to bank account and vice versa pretty fast. Sometimes within half a day. It's also one of the safest around, imo.

I use it for long term plays and as a bridge fiat-crypto and then it suffices.
7897 2018-04-30 08:35:26 Russian regulators are currently drafting crypto regulations. A  final version, which will be released in July 2018, will legalize and  set guidelines for initial coin offerings, blockchain technologies, and crypto mining. How do you think that will go?

7910 2018-04-30 08:33:27 With all due respect, It is not about disrespecting the holders.  It is about who is Ripple accountable to.  And that is not the co-owners of xrp, it is the shareholders of Ripple.  We, unfortunately are just riding on Ripple's coattails.

7916 2018-04-30 08:31:35 In two words. It’s 9220 now. There was an upward road, but it was impossible to break through 9500. We will have to wait to make a decision, because we have a hard resistance both up and down. I think we will fall down. The nearest stop is 9000 and 8700

7960 2018-04-30 08:23:42 Does that mean that a good play is to reduce your exposure within $alts across to #BTC for the interim and then move back into $alts once they have stabilised with the profited #BTC and a lowered $alt price?

8032 2018-04-30 08:12:15 there is currently no trust for any other country to assume the role that the USD fills as a bridge currency so crypto would be a obvious choice for this.

8046 2018-04-30 08:09:59 All in all, the crypto-currency world is still uncertain and full of shady actors, not to mention raging price manipulation.

8162 2018-04-30 07:49:22 Have you ever considered running for crypto twitter president?
8163 2018-04-30 07:49:09 @thenoelmiller what's that crypto currency video link you and @codyko were talking about on the podcast?
8164 2018-04-30 07:48:59 The thing I hate the most about this space is that it s plenty of pundits  criticising the system the are relying upon even now. 
Wich brand is your pc nic? How are your shoes made? Do you think crypto would change that ?
8165 2018-04-30 07:48:59 It's not wrong, just wanted to know if all that's necessary or that I can get these coins somewhere else without all the document verifications.
8166 2018-04-30 07:48:31 Indeed, in some cases, even beneficial to the authorities that criminals use crypto calculations. It's not always a covert operation. #LFE
8167 2018-04-30 07:48:24 Probably a good thing anyways if true. A lot of these terms have different meanings depending on who you talk to. Decentralization is particularly vague. That word gets thrown around in the crypto community like politicians throw around the word terrorism.

8214 2018-04-30 07:45:38 Can you explain how altcoins track USD valuation opposed to BTC? Since you sell to BTC, if you then buy another token surly it's BTC valuation?
8215 2018-04-30 07:45:36 Or a crystal ball .
8216 2018-04-30 07:45:23 i never understood how if most alts are only paired with btc, if you have  100 people holding 1k worth of btc of that alt, why would the price drop unless people sell it

8431 2018-04-30 07:15:31 With all major banks foraying into crypto with their trading desks, the traction of crypto will increase with common people. It's ironic because point of decentralization is to subvert the big banks.

8478 2018-04-30 07:08:31 Im not sure why Kenyans are crying out for a better education system.

The way i see it, the internet is one huge education resource - videos, audios, papers, blogs, twitter.

I never learnt "blockchain" in school. I learnt everything i know a out crypto and blockchain online.
8479 2018-04-30 07:08:29 imo the CFTC should oversee crypto exclusively. The SEC does not have the correct approach.
8480 2018-04-30 07:08:08 Dude, my original plan was to bum around in the hotel and annoy people, but someone gifted me a ticket.

8569 2018-04-30 06:58:21 lol you obviously don't follow the right guys like @kazonomics. To people with an extreme edge, sharing money/calls is like sharing happiness e.g. a happy person willingly shares his happiness with others, as it's meant to be shared/not a finite resource. Unhappy people don't.
8570 2018-04-30 06:58:10 In my opinion Bitcoin and Litecoin are must have crypto currencies in your crypto portfolio.
Ethereum and Monero I would suggest investing into a little as well.
Also day trading is pretty hard so it’s best to just buy and hold until mass adoption.

8591 2018-04-30 06:54:27 Crypto currency is so unstable that I don't think it'll work. There's no value to it whatsoever, which is pretty similar to our current system, but cryptos are so difficult to transfer that it won't break its way into businesses.

8675 2018-04-30 06:39:14 Comparing Bitcoin consumption to banking consumption is not making it less polluting. Banking pollution + Bitcoin pollution = even worse. 

We need to look at other more sustainable ways to reach consensus in crypto, such as #ProofofStake, #DAG or other hybrid models.

8697 2018-04-30 06:35:05 Market Cap seems relatively meaningless vis a vis the focus we put on this in equities given in crypto we can create a token for virtually nothing and with a relatively insignificant amount of money create the perception of billions of US$ of value.  So what should we focus on?
8698 2018-04-30 06:35:04 It's fun to laugh at moronic failures. All crypto currencies provide plenty of comedy gold in this aspect, but IOTA is especially bountiful.

8934 2018-04-30 05:54:29 ..but Kaz has turned me into a profitable trader. Keep in mind that this is in the bear market of crypto and high volatility situation of the stock market. If I can do it, so can you. Don't limit yourself.

9065 2018-04-30 05:28:00 the central bank of St. Louis published a statement that I was saying month ago! Cryptos have the same value as fiat money! It consists of ones and zeros!  The utility is the same. Another step in the right direction!

9071 2018-04-30 05:27:15 I've been meaning to try it again. Tried it awhile back and it was too new. Not enough features. Really, there needs to be a plug-in with a built in lightning wallet. Then brave doesn't need to reinvent the browser
9072 2018-04-30 05:27:05 It's basically neutral. The SEC makes their case so far about sales of restricted shares, so they wanted to freeze proceeds from these sales. These proceeds are not in Longfin's or Meenavalli's accounts, so they can't freeze their accounts. But they want to freeze three others.

• 4. 17 millionth Bitcoin is mined.
• 5. Binance more profitable than Germany's largest bank.

9205 2018-04-30 05:06:04 Might be the catalyst for a replacement.  The market will correct. Hopefully...
9206 2018-04-30 05:05:54 I see where you’re going.  Look for someone that has done business analysis work in unrelated fields.  I remember seeing a few good ones on there for previous projects I’ve used it for.
9207 2018-04-30 05:05:43 個人的には、通貨2種類の配布とビットペット1体の配布にしようかな！って思ってます。
通貨2種の方が食いつく分母が大きそうなのと、拡散されることでビットペット含めたdappsに興味を持ってくれる人が増えそうなので(｀・ω・´)
9208 2018-04-30 05:05:38 もう一つミクロ経済学で言えば、
トークンは上手に回れば厚生経済学で言う、
（負の）外部性の内部化も出来て総生産量の最適化できそうな気はします

All #burgers are sandwiches, but not all #sandwiches are burgers. 

All #cryptocurrency are cryptoassets, but not all #cryptoassets are cryptocurrency.

9495 2018-04-30 04:14:55 Hi Crypto,
I've been using both profit trailer as well as feeder that works on  top of it. The feeder is pretty accurate but conservative and sometimes slow in detecting both downtrends and uptrends.
 otherwise it is all about settings; adjusting them depending on market trend.

9667 2018-04-30 03:44:55 Bitcoin Core is not a coin. There is bitcoin, then there is BCash, a fork of bitcoin. One has the name bitcoin. One does not. If you can’t understand basic logic, I suggest going back to grade school.

9671 2018-04-30 03:43:24 I'm afraid they do! Let's say you need medicine from your local pharmacy. They only accept fiat, so you have to exchange your crypto for fiat to buy your medicine. Being blind to facts won't help #crypto s cause. Adoption is a long way away but it will happen gradually.

I've learned my lesson to take screen shots of their original tweet BEFORE I reply w/ something that could rattle their cage. Let's see if he deletes his tweet or pays up. 
9695 2018-04-30 03:38:10 Being married or having kids at 19 or 20 is not the move. I’d rather put my money in stocks and crypto currency and travel than be paying for doctor bills, daycare fees, diamond rings and unaffordable weddings. Be wise people

9697 2018-04-30 03:38:03 ANN, our #algorithmictrading bot has finally given the long-awaited short signal for $EOS. We are 85% confident that the top has been reached, at least temporarily. SHORT UP! #crypto #btc
9698 2018-04-30 03:38:02 Amazing
9699 2018-04-30 03:37:22 Soon...the only other major crypto I know of that is back at its ATH is EOS...so give LTC some time...it won’t disappoint :)
9700 2018-04-30 03:36:51 Involuntary or not people use fiat because it has an advantage over #crypto and that is adoption.
9701 2018-04-30 03:36:49 Sorry for no $BTC updates. I've been traveling all day.
9702 2018-04-30 03:36:41 yes some useless coins also more than millions dollar
9703 2018-04-30 03:36:22 But I 100% agree would love to start conference hopping
9704 2018-04-30 03:36:18 TBC is a PEER to PEER Private Crypto-Currency. 

Your efforts to expand our TBC community give you the opportunity to Sell TBC and to purchase goods and services using TBC/Kringle coins.
9705 2018-04-30 03:36:01 The problem with a lot of this crypto currency stuff right now is that all of the infrastructure is in an alpha state. A lot of things around transaction speed/cost, identity management and other infrastructure are still being built out.

お昼です。
HBC  HomeBlockCoin  224％↑↑

昨日もご紹介した通貨ですね。
4/29にBitcointalkで、決済手段としてとある企業と提携を進めている旨がありました。それがこの上昇につながっていると思われます。
9720 2018-04-30 03:34:08 I think the only coin that I've heard of that gave an acceptable heads up because of a conference was $STRAT
9721 2018-04-30 03:34:05 我全能の神なり
9722 2018-04-30 03:34:03 Well, I’m not so bothered by such insulting comments. I’m delighted to earn rebates — that I can easily and freely convert to $PROC — for buying stuff, including stuff I would have bought anyway, often from the same store I would have bought it from. Walmart, GoDaddy, Home Depot!
9723 2018-04-30 03:34:01 Kevin:  This is where we pointed out our last longterm Crypto call for our members.  They would've made 3x against $BTC and 6x against the US dollars in less than 2 months if held all the way through #BTC #ETH #BCH #XRP #EOS #TRX #XVG
9724 2018-04-30 03:33:48 Maybe I need to go back to tweeting about social media marketing strategies and crypto trading tips. 

6 days of crazy sleep schedules is making me feel a little Kanye.

9726 2018-04-30 03:33:37 @CNBCFastMoney You guy’s should interview @HeyRhett and ask him about his latest projects in crypto currency . #BitcoinPrime

9728 2018-04-30 03:33:17 I don't keep my crypto on an exchange like a pleb. I don't bother with less than 50%

9731 2018-04-30 03:32:54 Make room for crypto 20k soon. The message now is to open a wallet and buy $100 dollars in Satoshis. Spreading the ownership creates more stability. Convert new users to wallets. Pay kids allowance in Satoshis. Cool campaign
9732 2018-04-30 03:32:51 Well, have you actually tried buying crypto currency yet? Once you do that I’d start looking at @metamask_io & @CryptoKitties for examples of UX/use cases that leverage crypto. Apart from those most of the Daaps that are out there are decentralized exchanges.

9735 2018-04-30 03:32:19 Nope, it’s recent strength is simply a correlation to recent interest rate moves
9736 2018-04-30 03:32:15 so buy from IDEX as it appears or wait to dump?

9825 2018-04-30 03:17:32 Yep, you can bag some good buys due to the low volume, with a bit of patience..like Idex. Set and forget, check in in a week or two..
9826 2018-04-30 03:17:31 I really can’t wait to go for a few drinks & talk shop with you guys about your experiences building crypto currency mobile apps.
9827 2018-04-30 03:17:23 This is exactly why the crypto ban is problematic and is a particular form of censorship.

9829 2018-04-30 03:17:21 #bitcoin #Crypto #blockchain is the answer to a burning question at the core of our society that we don't yet know how to ask.  Same as thing with The Internet in the early 1990s. @aantonop @SatoshiLite @jimmysong @ToneVays @VitalikButerin @TimDraper Need to focus on the question

9832 2018-04-30 03:15:29 Crypto = coins/tokens or anything that is the "medium of exchange of value" in a blockchain network
9833 2018-04-30 03:15:27 So many people didn't believe me & called me a fake. I thought I'd take pics w/ ppl at bComm & upload those. But the topic continued. 

For the other people out there that have been referred to as fake but truly are not, I feel for them as it can be frustrating.

9837 2018-04-30 03:15:03 Every crypto with appropriate use case will win. No doubt about it.

Only thing is - Where are the use cases?

The strategy so far seems to be. . first distribute the crypto, and then hope that use cases will emerge. (And which is why people are still skeptical)

9839 2018-04-30 03:14:59 1/ Baby Boomers do not understand crypto at a fundamental level. They understand formal debtor/creditor relationships & quarterly growth statements.

9842 2018-04-30 03:14:33 Support is building. Sell walls are ready to back up at any sign of big candle volume. I think we may inch up, hit 10k, fly to 12k, then dip back down to 8k. How far we bounce back off that will determine the trajectory of the whole year

9875 2018-04-30 03:09:52 Crypto is at best in it’s infancy. If it matures to a viable global scale alternative to banks,   it’s highly unlikely that any of the current cryptos will be a ubiquitous standard. More likely decentralized competition crushes prices. BTC not a long term investment.

9913 2018-04-30 03:03:21 1/ One reason to be bullish on crypto that is rarely discussed (at least directly) is that the strength of conviction for those who believe in the underlying technology, cryptoassets, and economics is much greater than the conviction of those who believe it is all a scam.
9914 2018-04-30 03:03:17 Majority of the crypto will sink and only few will succeed. People are buying just keeping Bitcoin in mind. Don't compare orange with Apple

9939 2018-04-30 03:00:03 The most foolish prediction in the blockchain space are where people say only one or two cryptos will win and the rest will die.

9969 2018-04-30 02:55:07 Was the #1 reason I invested in EOS.  2nd reason" @brockpierce 1rst impressions of Brock are varied due to the garb he sometimes wears. But listening to him speak of the space & how he embraces other coins is impressive. fwiw.yes, I read about allegations. No charges filed.

9981 2018-04-30 02:52:22 I always have a confusion that can stock TA directly applied to Crypto TA ?
Crypto market is too naive and influenced by FOMO or any kind of news.

9984 2018-04-30 02:51:20 I am currently trading crypto and have a few contracts with 2 mining pools. I'm always open to looking at new ideas.
9985 2018-04-30 02:51:18 Is that a wig?
9986 2018-04-30 02:51:17 Not concerned. Maybe small $200 pull back but $10,240 target still in sight. We are blasting through that down trend line this week boss. You won't need to teach people how to draw proper diagonals anymore.  At least until the back test if we have one.  Ha ha. $BTC #bitcoin
9987 2018-04-30 02:51:04 Why not scale in slowly? It's 10% from where we are now to $8.2K -> if you're here for the long game, it'd be better doing that then #FOMO on a bounce to $11K? I get your rationale short to midterm...plenty of #FUD flying around that it was just a repeat if February again #BTC
