48 2018-07-02 19:48:25 For certain, housing doesn't obey simplistic supply-demand relations like simple commodities. But ultimately, "market rate housing" just means "the price that's available to anybody." The system currently may be unjust, but one goal of a better system should contain low MRH.
49 2018-07-02 19:47:28 Estamos desse jeito por causa da corrupção dos governantes e porque somos exportadores de commodities, se fossemos intensivo em tecnologia seriamos muito melhor. Apesar disso somos a 8 economia mundial e nosso território é enorme, o que torna mais difícil governar.

51 2018-07-02 19:35:40 Those are not tradable commodities that enrich and empower gangs. Actual violent crime is a crime against another person. The war on drugs has done nothing to slow the rate of overdoses or anything else. Prohibition breeds violence, as we saw in the 1920s.

55 2018-07-02 19:14:57 What is the role of the #MinistryofCommerce? What is the purpose of the price control act? Inflation of commodities is getting out of hand. No agency is regulating these prices based on the price control act. #bid0706 #bidsview #ThisisNigeria

78 2018-07-02 17:21:14 Thanks! It is worth looking at the financialization of commodities in the early 2000s as an analog. Not  the same, but significant change in market dynamics once institutions came into the market.

83 2018-07-02 17:08:03 Has anybody cross-reff'd Trump's stock portfolio with the commodities he puts tariffs on? I mean, is this the biggest, blatant stock market manipulation for personal gain EVER?
84 2018-07-02 17:03:22 Certainly, large organisations that want to treat employees as interchangeable commodities (e.g. gradism) need to eliminate trust as a dependency, thus driving crazy governance. But should an organisation rely purely on human relationships to operate well?
85 2018-07-02 17:00:38 Es correcto y más interesante aún,   hubo una crisis financiera en 2007 commodities en U.S.A. Que afectó a todo el mundo por lo cual no hubo crecimiento proyectado y la paridad perdió dólar se mantuvo 17% de $10.99 a 12.89 inflación 4.8% promedio
86 2018-07-02 17:00:31 Conflicts would focus on protecting males/claiming males as spoils along with other commodities.
Elves, able to cross-breed through their fey origin, might dominate, effectively choosing which shorter-lived races to perpetuate.
87 2018-07-02 16:57:35 Seems like a trade war on commodities, if they put tariffs on things people actually use there will be a coup.
88 2018-07-02 16:48:59 No thanks on the equities, but Commodities feel like value down here.
89 2018-07-02 16:48:48 Great stuff, we need more products into the European Markets. Zim has plenty to offer in terms of agric commodities.
90 2018-07-02 16:48:24 Oops—that’s “commodities,” *not* “commodies.”
91 2018-07-02 16:46:10 But where Durkheim, Mauss, and Freud are actually somewhat superior to Marx is in the fact that while the specific mediator may change (commodities, images), mediation/fetishes as such cannot be eliminated in toto.
92 2018-07-02 16:45:03 Or, in the same way commodities mediate for Marx, images/spectacles mediate for Debord (while for Baudrillard the images mediate each other)

106 2018-07-02 15:48:07 I've thought about making a video about it, but it would take a while to do so because I need to understand it way better. As to how it can help/impact the national debt, I'm not sure yet. Currently Crypto-currencies are treated like commodities, rather than legal tender.
107 2018-07-02 15:46:21 Cannot use a basket of commodities b/c the amount they would have to inflate to offset the debt outstanding would starve billions & make driving (oil) & electrification (copper) unaffordable to all but the richest people in the world.

115 2018-07-02 15:19:24 In the business of food commodities, Information in Quantity, Quality, transit timeline etc is as valuable as the product itself.

136 2018-07-02 13:52:58 There’s a view that Hausmann’s rebuilding of Paris generated new lifestyles and, therefore, new forms of consumption. It’s in Beaudelaire, people! Now, more commodities & consumption are immaterial. So what is today’s equivalent of Paris’s transformation?
137 2018-07-02 13:52:17 That was a seriously fucking stupid waste of commodities and profitable secondary market goods. It's the same damn thing with government forcing farmers to destroy their crops as a price control, because of the subsidies they're given.
138 2018-07-02 13:45:48 PC talks of essential commodities and that should be free of taxes. Thanks to him and his Ilk there area many who can't afford even essentials! When compliance increases and collections become healthy tax slabs can be reduced. Comparing to rich countries is stupid.
139 2018-07-02 13:40:41 Refreshing interview Prime minister! Thank you @SwarajyaMag ! On the GST, if tax rates lowered for essential commodities, hidden taxes removed, why hasnt fundamental cost of those commodities not come down to end consumer? Why is consumer outgo the same or increased only?

169 2018-07-02 10:52:21 One GST should only mean uniform rate through out rhe country and not single rate across all the con modified. Present rates of GST are fairly good and may be further reduced with higher compliance. Single rate of GST across all commodities will be chaotic .

180 2018-07-02 09:46:06 Ninad, you need to research how GST works. Truly said, milk and ration etc is not directly under GST but indirectly there is no fixed calculation of how much taxes we are paying on these commodities. Any idea why Milk is costlier these day?
181 2018-07-02 09:38:30 Yes the aim was simplicity. Even then, the gov has reduced tax on basic commodities. Milk, ration items are charged at 0%. I think @Shvetmehra should try and research why fuel is not under GST yet. FM jaitley in his recent blog has briefly mentioned the reason.
182 2018-07-02 09:31:30 Copper is the new gold for investments imo too. We should all have copper in our portfolios. Over the next 5 years copper will beat most commodities in my opinion.
183 2018-07-02 09:29:26 It's not surprising that Jobless growth is stated as benchmark despite Petrol diesel rupee jokes made by RW themselves! Btw, cutting chai was 5 earlier and commodities aren't limited to it. Admitting facts won't belittle your political heroes!
184 2018-07-02 09:21:38 MSP for most agri commodities is paper price to play with the sentiments of farmers.

211 2018-07-02 06:25:40 Certain commodities that are extremely  essential to the human life should be exempt or taxes reduced. Plus if you think we are generating enough revenue to do demand for all services we demand for, you are wrong. That doesn't mean that the system is perfect though.

221 2018-07-02 05:42:33 This is as foolish a statement as any of his numerous others. Surely there are many other essential commodities which are taxed at different rates. Naming Mercedez with Milk solely because both of them start with an "M" is an attempt to mislead & divert from the real issue.
222 2018-07-02 05:36:25 It wasn't Socialism that ruined Venezuela. Private Property is still very much a thing there. The "socialist" government came in and tried to lower the prices for basic commodities and food for the people. grocery store owners decided they couldn't keep profits...

225 2018-07-02 05:15:06 Well the problem with #fuelpricehike it has a negative ripple effect to commodities that also consumed by people without cars; for instance taxi fares will go up and definitely the price of bread and food will go up in the excuse of an increased transportation costs. U see?
226 2018-07-02 05:14:39 "applying basic economics to commerce"-- nonsense statement. Econ basically is the study _of_ commerce.

ec·o·nom·ics: 1. the branch of knowledge concerned with the production, consumption, and transfer of wealth.

Commerce:  the exchange of...goods, commodities, property, etc.
227 2018-07-02 05:01:36 I say this from experience - our system has ALWAYS SEPARATED FAMILIES & treated humans like shit & commodities. Comparing level 10 treatment now to levels 10, 9 & 8 prior to 2017 IS STILL UNACCEPTABLE TREATMENT ALL THE SAME & nothing worth settling for. #AbolishICE /fin
228 2018-07-02 05:00:32 There are things money are can't buy, they called Trust, Sincerity & Time. They are your most valuable commodities, treat them with utmost respect.

236 2018-07-02 04:23:57 Ah that venerable principle, Sickularism!  Bought & sold like commodities.
237 2018-07-02 04:23:27 Expected better from you Yusuf. That is crazy talk on so many counts. Even the units of the two commodities isn't common for anyone to compare, leave alone the regressiveness of such a tax structure.
238 2018-07-02 04:21:26 See.....GU....made a high @1.3215 range again last friday also.....against buy @1.3050-1.3030 range on last week.....see last week's buy call 1st--what next???

ARE YOU STILL LOSS IN COMMODITIES AND CURRENCY MARKETS????
239 2018-07-02 04:19:53 As with anything, there are varied results. The labor flows into the US says there was less economic opportunity in MX. If we are going to send commodities back and forth, labor needs similar freedom.

243 2018-07-02 03:38:40 Trump embodies a Baby Boomer ideal of family values. His narcissistic lack of empathy has led to multiple marriages and detached relationships with the wives and children he treats as commodities.
244 2018-07-02 03:35:59 Had lunch date with commodities trader who only talked about oil futures and kept checking price on his phone.  Doesn’t want to see me again cuz I’m not warm and passionate?  WTF?  #guyssuck
245 2018-07-02 03:32:53 thinking about B*st B*y phasing out CDs got me thinking...... like, what if there comes a time where kp()p abandons their high quality CD packaging? or if they become even more high priced cuz they'll be true commodities???? WHAT IF WE HAVE TO LIVE IN A WORLD W/O PHYSICAL ALBUMS?
246 2018-07-02 03:24:57 Gees it appears that I've quit being a FX trader and have become a crude oil/commodities trader now!

250 2018-07-02 03:11:26 What happened to the whole 3rd world debt / Jubilee 2000 thing? Did the commodities boom just take care of most of that era of global south debt?
251 2018-07-02 03:07:18 Does the payment of net export of commodities gets settled in USD or AUD ?  Do exporters use hedging from offshore or onshore banking ? It could have a bearing on your model.
252 2018-07-02 03:06:55 #Argentinatrucha Otro de los temas que en Argentina es crucial es el estado de los #puertos que se quedaron en el tiempo, en momentos de record en #commodities y el estado de los #caminos #rurales, y el querer cobrar extra por usarlos en el estado que están. Realmente trucho.

254 2018-07-02 02:52:36 Yeaper. Diversify your assest classes into commodities, fixed income or equities.
255 2018-07-02 02:52:23 Sir our foreign policy is totally failed. Sir you are compromising with foreign country to please your corporate friends like Ambani, Adani, Birla, vendanta, Mittal and other crooks. Sir pl@looked in to the price of essential commodities and petroleum product.NDA now corruption
256 2018-07-02 02:51:12 Malaysia roll out 6% gst across all commodities and it worked fine. It’s a separate matter that new govt has now abolished gst though. It was a big ticket item for winning election
257 2018-07-02 02:46:29 You better pay attention. These will be hot commodities when the socialism fails.
258 2018-07-02 02:41:54 No, it's not. Wage labor it's not free market capitalism nor some sort of financial schemes. Capitalism emerges from the evolution of property rights into individual property rights and when those properties (commodities) began to be freely exchanged.
259 2018-07-02 02:41:42 There could be just three slabs, tax neccasities (free), commodities (medium) and luxury (high). You see, it does not have to be a big economist to make it simple, now who is talking loose?
260 2018-07-02 02:35:27 Empower yourself by fighting your addiction to the capitalist commodities known as drugs.
261 2018-07-02 02:35:24 Capitalists look at the world and wonder, "how can I get all the money -- I know, by compensating my people minimally an treating them like a commodities."  Socialists look at the capitalist and say "could you please get your heel off of my windpipe?"
262 2018-07-02 02:29:35 it enables that problem - the banks created that mess. Fractional reserve banking fails once you start creating more money than the resources and commodities that have been mined/produced in a human lifetime otherwise you are selling debt to future generations
263 2018-07-02 02:26:47 Debt can only be sustained if there are resources&commodities to cover the capital, putting money in the hands of citizens and putting them in charge of their economic future is the answer & BCH along with crowdsourcing/pvt vc's already provides that power, making banks redundant
264 2018-07-02 02:22:16 @elonmusk just a quick thought: at which point will co opted infrastructure be adopted for the betterment of mankind? I mean synthesis of private and public services and commodities
265 2018-07-02 02:09:03 Most commodities aren't as unevenly distributed or as currently unsubstitutable as coltan. 64% -possibly more - of total world supply currently sits in Congo. 

From their POV, a monopoly like that would *have* to be destabilized, militarily or otherwise, if it wasn't already.
266 2018-07-02 02:03:38 O petróleo é estratégico, não pode ser só commodities! Que crime esse governo golpista está cometendo
267 2018-07-02 01:55:33 Farm commodities have been supported by government policy and, dare I say it, redistribution since the 1930's.  Without that price support and government efforts to buy agricultural goods, your livelihood would not exist.  Wierd, how you dont know that.
268 2018-07-02 01:54:53 Extreme wealth breeds a class of people for whom people are disposable commodities.  Once Oligarchs achieve unchecked economic and political power, as they have in the United States, the citizens too become disposable. - Chris Hedges
269 2018-07-02 01:54:03 Maybe Lebron is no longer as concerned about winning but always in the past he’s pushed out young players for proven commodities. I would think he’s still in win now mode.
270 2018-07-02 01:45:43 nunca vou perdoar um professor de economia brasileira que fez a gente ler um texto de 120 páginas em que o Bacha analisava mil variáveis pra mostrar que durante os anos lula todo o progresso se devia ao ciclo das commodities e jamais às politicas domésticas

How did people fall for his economic ideas?
274 2018-07-02 00:23:41 @narendramodi Sir I dont agree with your statement that the single rate of GST cant be applied on all commodities, whereas you are a champion of advocating an idea of Only One in all diversified utilities
