40 2018-09-04 22:15:30 I think a good argument could be made that cheap raw materials make cheap waste required, so increasing cost of waste = increase in cost of commodities. More evidence of the end of cheap nature.

52 2018-09-04 21:10:18 I think leftists get thrown in a tizzy over housing because they assume that, like pretty much every necessary commodity, that the issue is distribution and not supply, when in fact it's one of the few necessary commodities that we don't actually have enough of
53 2018-09-04 21:01:57 Drugs do not relax you, they reinforce your violent addiction to capitalist commodities.
54 2018-09-04 20:48:11 Far as I can tell livestock needs crops, that get turned into rations that are processed locally from local grain crops. Employing local people. Knowing income is stable from some commodities ensures business stay local too for all
55 2018-09-04 20:42:46 Mike - you know I did not mean that, please do not put words in my mouth. My take on it is that some communities like Clinton & Seaforth are very intertwined with SM, it would have a big effect on them if SM farmers & the businesses that specialize in those commodities were lost

58 2018-09-04 20:36:18 Sometimes, and even then that can be used more efficiently. But solar/wind is also on the rise, and once storage is a key part of the game, that solves a lot of problems. My main point tho was the increase demand for the new commodities- lithium/cobalt etc
59 2018-09-04 20:31:49 I have a super mondo hottake about the sexual marketplace. Theres a huge decrease of sexual interaction among American women.

63 2018-09-04 20:08:01 I can tell with a degree of certainty the next step of the govt of kenya would be to tax pharmaceuticals or healthcare commodities in guise of raising funds for #UHC but it will be to plug the #budgetdeficit blackhole. You can take that to Equity.

65 2018-09-04 20:04:33 US equity markets returned from holiday in a slightly defensive mood, S&P500 down 0.2%. US bond yields  higher, as is US dollar. Commodities weaker, copper -2.7%. Emerging currencies under pressure, led by Sth African rand - economy entered recession for  first time since 2009.
66 2018-09-04 20:01:04 I'd argue that literally every investor today has to be a global investor to understand what's going on - certainly in markets like energy and commodities, but also to take advantage of where we think the best opportunities are going to be. -- John Burbank
67 2018-09-04 19:58:45 Do y'all also think $DXY breaking back to the upside is hurting all commodities.  Copper was down big today too
68 2018-09-04 19:57:13 Estamos atrapados en la ruleta de las commodities.
69 2018-09-04 19:55:35 Pretty big flaw in there: if our labour is required to produce commodities then we won't collectively reduce any amount of work by all being forced into that exploitation, capitalism has divided labour and lead to alienation. Intrinsic to capitalism is also unemployment-- that;
70 2018-09-04 19:55:10 What we shouldn't do is use IMF as an excuse when we want to raise taxes. There is no law that VAT needs to be at 16% , we can stretch it across more commodities and lower it to about 11%

72 2018-09-04 19:47:45 He aquí una cadena de pensamientos... La economía se cae a pedazos. Recortan el estado a menos de un 50% siguen bajando impuestos a los commodities. Suben los impuestos a lo que el país puede o le quede por producir. Licuan las jubilaciones, asignaciones y planes.  Sigo.
73 2018-09-04 19:41:13 Si. A mi se me ha ocurrido un fondo dual de los commodities, uno de estabilidad fiscal y otro de Fomento. Cuando hay boom se guarda en el fiscal en el extranjero, cuando caen se transfieren al país en el de fomento. Para eso necesitamos renovar nuestra clase política.

77 2018-09-04 19:39:22 This #bjp gov is going on the similar path of India shining one from 2004,u need to reduce the prices of day to day required commodities.
78 2018-09-04 19:37:10 As long as human labor is required to produce the commodities we all consume, yes, you are just perpetuating the exploitation of others by running away. The point is to collectively reduce the amount of work needed to produce what we all need... How does that morality go?

102 2018-09-04 18:42:40 not sure for all commodities, but regarding the wheat - farmers already used the opportunity of high international prices and forecasts of record production in Argie also sold forward a lot of wheat. so now they could hold it for a while..

Its time we stood up over;

2. uncontrollable borrowing
3. Price hike of basic commodities.

But again it is a mockery of Kenyans when we cry of an exploitive cost of living and some people somewhere are carrying millions in bags.

132 2018-09-04 17:30:29 EMHO, el impuesto "transitorio" a las exportaciones es de pesimo diseño, dado que:
1) No cumple con el principio tributario de uniformidad. Toma 2 grandes grupos y establece $4 y $3 por dolar. Sin tener en cuenta las diferencias entre distintas MOI y MOA, como las de commodities
133 2018-09-04 17:28:43 En realidad no fue solo la chequera Venezolana. Se acabó el boom de los commodities y Argentina y Venezuela no estaban preparados, Bolivia si y Brasil no del todo.

145 2018-09-04 16:35:31 Excise is derived from the Dutch accijns, from the Latin accensare, meaning simply "to tax". 1755 dictionary:

EXCI'SE. n.s. ... A hateful tax levied upon commodities adjudged not by the common judges of property, but wretches hired by those to whom excise is paid.

172 2018-09-04 15:04:25 Parliament and the executive should have a round table meeting to look for other avenues to raise taxes and cushion Kenyans from paying more for essential commodities.
173 2018-09-04 14:59:37 Pointing to us how prices have gone up will not help in any way. Instead one should look at the positives and champion ideas on how we can facilitate the local production of such commodities.
174 2018-09-04 14:58:58 Pero el sistema impuesto, cuando cae el precio aumenta la retención. Es decir con la tendencia de los últimos años en commodities, cuando menos vale, más se pagará. Ilógico.

226 2018-09-04 13:09:39 Bullshit, I live in the real world. In Nigeria, 10,000naira can't alleviate you from poverty.
What realistic business can you start with 10k?buy Maggi and sell, onions? Tomatoes? All these commodities are more expensive in bulk. Like what business can you do with 10k
227 2018-09-04 13:09:37 This comment exposes Gladwell’s limitations. He’s been most successful flattering the status quo with unchallenging but well crafted observations. In this context “ideas” become commodities, for Bannon, they’re weapons. Malcolm brings oranges to a knife fight

Eles querem mesmo transformar o Brasil num imenso precariato produtor de commodities de baixíssimo valor agregado. 
 E tudi com tecnologia estrangeira, ficando todo espólio ambiental e social na conta do País.

230 2018-09-04 12:59:58 Guilherme: Blairo é a síntese do ruralismo arcaico brasileiro. Confunde uso de subprodutos da guerra química (aperfeiçoados pela grande indústria química) + TI embarcada com "modernidade".
São ignorantes completos que transformam o Brasil num mero produtor de commodities.

233 2018-09-04 12:55:09 In The Art of Being Fromm theorizes that people engage in "trivial talk" (politics,weather,family,etc...) in order to talk about themselves. Their commodities being their identity, trivial talk is a vehicle to talk about their favorite subject, themselves.
234 2018-09-04 12:49:56 Well done to @CharlieElphicke on #Treasury Select Committee for exposing the highly questionable assertions made by #BoE officials regarding cost of basic commodities with a No Deal (#WTO) #Brexit. #Carney & Co deliberately misleading the Committee & public over potential risks

246 2018-09-04 12:07:07 The real answer to that is I'm merely a citizen & not a member of MDC.

So if GNU can save us, GNU it is.
247 2018-09-04 12:06:48 While govt has turned deaf ears to sufferings of common man prices of essential commodities are sky rocketing and opposition is not taking this matter with full force. Opposition should come out on roads to fight for common people.

under MMS with increase in fue price-rate of inflation for all essential commodities increased many fold....during his regime we have always seen rate of inflation in double digit
269 2018-09-04 11:34:29 the other commodities whose prices are fallen in Modi Sarkaar,are hardly debated.Why??

271 2018-09-04 11:33:18 I have never analysed that in-depth to answer that question. What I meant was that some commodities/products try to address more user needs than their primary purpose, and therefore need to appear more unique.

273 2018-09-04 11:32:35 You ought to read up on your EU history. Its beginnings as the European Coal and Steel Community after WW2 was so that they identified commodities so important to trade, that they wouldn’t go to war to ruin that! How dare you liken history’s biggest peace project to the Nazis

279 2018-09-04 11:29:46 why there is a constant increase in fuel prices when the crude oils price is falling. Don’t you think this raise in price is killing us adversely in turn raising price of commodities. As tax payers we would like to know the actual calculation on fixings petrol & diesel price.

287 2018-09-04 11:13:50 True, but agricultural commodities(food crops) are also subject to price volatility. In the agricultural commodity value chain, wealth is asymmetrically distributed with farmers earning the least unless they add value. I believe we are speaking in terms of state IGR.

327 2018-09-04 09:53:24 It's not even a week since the oil prices increased and now prices of other commodities have increased. Sai ati chapo ya 10 bob ni 15. This is absurd. #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta

329 2018-09-04 09:43:17 Prices of basic commodities are skyrocketing,hospitals hv no medicine,poor sanitation (typhoid outbreak),stolen election,political violence,banks have no money  and were really does Chinese patronage come in!?.

331 2018-09-04 09:33:35 Prices are essential commodities rising daily no public or political parties opposed,only God can help .
332 2018-09-04 09:32:21 La industria pone precio de sus productos, los commodities no, asique la retención nueva de la industria se va a transformar en más precio al mercado interno, lo van a trasladar. Ósea que aparte de la devaluación el pais se morfa peoductos más caros. Vamos a pagar en el
333 2018-09-04 09:18:28 The problem with the rapid inflation rate brought about by the TRAIN law is that tumataas na nga ang cost ng commodities sa Pilipinas, pero yung suweldo ng mga ordinaryong mamamayan ay stagnant pa rin. Yes, inflation may be normal, but inflation THIS quick shouldn’t be.
334 2018-09-04 09:16:17 Gvt must do away with SI64 and allow people to import basic commodities and not let people in the hands of business jackals.
335 2018-09-04 09:16:01 People are in tears for soaring fuel price almost nearing Rs.100, all the essential commodities are increasing in prices but people like Mr.Bharathi raja and political leaders are voicing for Sophia's issue which she wanted to create publicity for herself

337 2018-09-04 09:15:18 No es una buena decisión poner un impuesto a las exportaciones, el cual agravará 1) la caída del PIB por debajo del -1% y 2) alimenta el círculo inflacionista en los precios internacionales de las commodities agrícolas

339 2018-09-04 09:02:37 I see folks celebrating shortages of commodities and price hikes forgetting that at the end of the day, this also affects them.
340 2018-09-04 09:02:23 Also most bulk commodities, such as wheat, ore, wood, etc go by rail for trips that can't be done by barge.
341 2018-09-04 09:01:36 Petrol is very essential. It is not only effects the personal transportation. But it will result into the price rise of all commodities. Because it is used in transporting goods as well.
342 2018-09-04 09:00:23 Stop increasing the prices of commodities recklessly for your loyal customers thinking they have nowhere else to go. One day they will leave never to be seen again

Most think currency is still underpinned by gold, assets or commodities. Few understand the implications of QE. Fewer understand they are materially effected by simple arbitrary decisions.

354 2018-09-04 08:33:46 It's official that  new prices are set.  While there is no telling how high prices of commodities are set to go high with higher costs of production one thing is certain, SAFI  HFO will be available and affordable. This innovation couldn't come at a better time for manufacturers.
355 2018-09-04 08:33:31 Rupee falling down to 71.21,fuel prices all time high,Sensex crashing by 338 points,economy crumbling- ‘acha din’ is arriving steadily With inflation leads to very high price rise of essential commodities,life of common man has become miserable Is FM Mr Jaitly aware of this?
356 2018-09-04 08:33:03 I agree after a good while there will be an increase in prices of commodities and when that happens do compare the increase in passenger fares to the increase in these margins. You'll note a queer difference
357 2018-09-04 08:25:18 “Colombia offers a stable long term growth of around 3 percent for the last decade independently of commodities prices and security issues”. Inflation expectations are around 3 percent,  stable exchange rate compared to the region.” President of Central Bank Juan Jose Echavarría
358 2018-09-04 08:24:31 Let Asad meet IMF and U.S foreign secretary. 
The next increase in price of commodities will open the eyes on entire nation.
Just wait and see.
359 2018-09-04 08:14:46 I agree there will be an increase in basic commodities and mind you it has taken that deep effect yet. The screaming increase in fare can only be alluded to a greedy Matatu transport system. You'll note not all fares have increased, mostly the "usual" saccos have done so
360 2018-09-04 08:09:06 Because an increase in fuel translates to a rise in prices for all basic commodities, even food, housing and clothing etc. Its about to get worse . Wait for almost all commodities to rise with a similar %

365 2018-09-04 07:55:37 The Bill should be assented to and then the government should genuinely fight graft because this is what causes the fuelling of prices of various basic commodities.
366 2018-09-04 07:51:55 May be. That time was time of boom n economic excessive upgradation. All banks, even private banks were giving loan too easily. Look at the property, stocks, commodities, crude, prices n inflation. But loan giving alone is not the only factor for loan defaults. Others?
367 2018-09-04 07:49:56 I don't care how good a game is; if it's built on crunch culture and a toxic environment, it is profiteering from damaging the health of people to produce commodities.

It's definitely not black and white but games built on bad crunch culture don't deserve adoration from peers.

379 2018-09-04 07:11:58 True Hon @hwende. The problem I have with some of your goons is that they seem to take joy in the fact that basic commodities are in short supply. They don't know that it's the ordinary, poor Zimbabwean who suffers including the ones who voted for them.

389 2018-09-04 06:30:57 So the prices for basic commodities has drastically risen.Cement has just disappeared from shop shelves. Companies are closing and some of the biggest companies like Delta are scaling down production. Where are we hearding? All we can do is wait and hope.
390 2018-09-04 06:30:32 Fuel prices under @BJP4India are heighest, inflation is <5%
Doesn't it mean  @narendramodi @arunjaitley managed to reduced prices of other commodities substantially to keep overall inflation under check?
Even with #Rupee #FuelOnFire problem #GDP growth is 8.2% & #inflation is <5%

396 2018-09-04 06:10:00 One of the major reasons inflation was controlled was because oil prices fell dramatically in first 2-3 years of Modi government. As they rise (and with a weakened rupee) inflation is set to rise. And I am still paying more for oil, essential commodities and everything I buy in $

399 2018-09-04 06:06:30 It is shameful that every time blame game will be on petrol prices, knowing the facts by every party. Whatever increase in other rates of other commodities may be, no one will bother. Every year there is abnormal increase in purchase of 2 & 4 wheeler, but they wouldn't bother.
400 2018-09-04 06:05:02 The hike in the price of commodities won’t hit the common people that much, if their buying capacity also rises accordingly & everyone has a secure job. Why isn’t the opposition rising this issue? Isn’t this issue attractive enough to secure more votes in #2019Elections?

404 2018-09-04 05:59:45 We're really going off on a tangent.
How about we bring it back home, and talk about "basic financial assets"?

Financial assets= stocks, bonds, funds, commodities, forex
All of these assets have Store Of Value.
Be it good or bad, risky or guaranteed, high or low gains.

Agreed?

418 2018-09-04 05:21:44 It's amazing how many of these closet misandrists never ever touch the fact that they are sold as commodities for exorbitant prices all in the name of "bride price".... Shouldn't that be the logical place to start

@dpradhanbjp
421 2018-09-04 05:08:16 Seeing the prices of other commodities and salary, the prices are still cheaper. You cannot expect the petrol prices to go down and salaries to just increase.

422 2018-09-04 05:02:51 I don’t think that would work with Russia as they aren’t as geographically isolated as Cuba and have access to other countries for commodities not produced by themselves
423 2018-09-04 05:02:46 U need 2 redirect Ur energy towards State Govt's who r reluctant 2 reduce d VAT & Surcharge on Petrol & Diesel.

430 2018-09-04 04:13:54 The petrol and diesel on all time high and the value of the rupee at lowest It is going to affect the transportation cost in turn all the essential commodities are being  expensive leaving the people in distress Nothing but sheer failure of governance of BJP regime!

433 2018-09-04 04:08:42 NDA Government has burdened common man by increasing Petrol price to 86.76 and  Diesel to 75.74 rupees in mumbai.This increase would lead to  inflation and increase in prices of essential commodities. PM Modi yeh ha hamare acche din.

438 2018-09-04 03:54:46 We should be having this convo in a locked boardroom, with white boards, flip charts and someone taking notes. A full day offsite and table the final product to DoL, SITA, DTI & DoE. We r giving away our precious commodities (time and brains) for free here
439 2018-09-04 03:49:03 Voices of D people can b controlled but not D commodities' prices. Using petrol-diesel is no more privilege of common men. Vehicles' of VIPs & riches will continue 2 run uninterrupted. Comport & privileges of lives R not of common public. Again bicycle revolution is needed 4 us.
440 2018-09-04 03:48:51 Children are not commodities or soft toys to just play with or for social showoff or for giving free advice to other people to have children.Every child is a huge responsibility that needs effort,time,divine love and natural upbringing so that they do no cause pain to others.
441 2018-09-04 03:46:33 @SakajaJohnson remind the president and vice president that increasing of prices for petroleum products will lead to increase of prices for basic commodities.What comes 1st between common mwananchi affording Unga or walking on a tarmac road.
442 2018-09-04 03:44:51 Oh,  please provide feedback! I'd love to hear if you have any tweaks. I've put together little baggies of the commodities, but the commodity cards are enough.  Also I've thought about integrating @ERBeckman presentation about language, but haven't gotten that far yet! #whapchat
443 2018-09-04 03:43:47 She seems to be excessively angry with everything and everyone...While we grudge hike in prices of certain commodities,  we are all okay with hike in salaries or reduced prices of certain other items of daily use
444 2018-09-04 03:34:29 Sí justo lo que se refería López Murphy al hacer un plan de ajuste del déficit para llegar al rebote de las commodities, el jamás pensó lo que iba a ocurrir con la soja a partir de 2002,, también De La Rúa fue demasiado tibio en no sostener a López Murphy y mantener el 1 a 1
445 2018-09-04 03:34:03 Stuff like this breaks the tie when I’m indifferent between products / commodities and pricing is similar, such as rental car companies.
446 2018-09-04 03:32:09 @MirchiJeeturaaj Having car does not make you out of middle class. Also all the 2 wheelers are on petrol and that is the middle class vehicles. Hope you also aware of Cascading effect of higher petroleum price on Commodities which consume by all classes of people.
@RadioMirchi
447 2018-09-04 03:31:10 >no fue buen tiempo para los commodities.
Creo fervientemente que la prensa fue un factor decisivo a la hora de la devaluación del 2002, máxime con el rechazo a la canasta de Cavallo.

448 2018-09-04 03:29:44 Marx started Capital with commodities for a reason folks
449 2018-09-04 03:28:24 I just realized my Sailor Moon dress gets me way more dates than my personality or looks (not that those were hot commodities).
450 2018-09-04 03:23:23 @MirchiJeeturaaj Having car does not make you out of middle class. Also all the 2 wheelers are on petrol and that is the middle class vehicles. Hope you also aware of Cascading effect of higher petroleum price on Commodities which consume by all classes of people.
451 2018-09-04 03:18:33 Samir.Your thoughts on Rs 11000 crore #NSEL fraud where 13000 families and PSUs have been LOOTED?

I am one of the victims and have stopped investing commodities and stocks...same like other HNIs looted.

Any impact of this on GDP if VHNI stop investing?
452 2018-09-04 03:16:32 And the 70 virgins shows that women are just commodities
453 2018-09-04 03:12:33 São tantos fatores que levam o crescimento do produto interno bruto pra gente ficar nesse debate raso, mas as commodities nesse ano provavelmente alavancaram a economia, depois pesquisa e me fala
454 2018-09-04 02:59:16 With commodities in shops disappearing what's Zanu saying? There is a deafening silence from Zanu.
1 free falling bond 
2 rhinos
3 shortage of drugs in hospitals
4 cement shortage
5 cooking oil

455 2018-09-04 02:52:18 Sugar crisis - soda is limited 
Rice Crisis - NFA rice scarcity. Bukbok rice.
Fisheries Crisis- imported Galunggung, Bangus shortage
Basic commodities Crisis - price hike spike 

FOOD CRISIS is HERE!!!! 

No economist needed to validate that. People know!
456 2018-09-04 02:45:30 Sumale commodities a precios planchados y casi sin financiamiento externo. Más los milicos levantados. Que haya llegado a 1989 es medio un milagro.
457 2018-09-04 02:35:42 Highest fuel prices under have broken the backbone of common people in India who are struggling for survival due to overall alarming increase in all the essential commodities.

459 2018-09-04 02:34:11 Modi govt has failed to curb rising prices of essential commodities , gas and petrol and diseal
460 2018-09-04 02:23:54 There is no cause for alarm because we should enjoy the pinch meanwhile as he leisurely thinks whether to sign it or not!  Price of commodities will go up and never drop with the prices of fuel as usual. Sarcastic one senator..
461 2018-09-04 02:23:17 I crave for an emotional connection,  far from money , commodities ,far from what you can give eachother.. more like what you can learn from eachother and be it a friendship or a relationship there is nothing like connecting and sharing your thoughts with people that won't judge
462 2018-09-04 02:21:28 No no no!! This cost doesn’t include the cost to SHIP things!! This is the ACTUAL cost of the commodities. Not shipping expenses.
463 2018-09-04 02:20:33 Why a long term heavy sanctions is the only way to treat Putin's Nuke armed Mafia state. Global Magnitsky must be increased,sieze offshore accts and prevent them from buying valuable commodities they convert their micro currency into portable wealth. Oligarchs will "retire"him
464 2018-09-04 02:04:05 Well management of #market expectation, appropriate policies, taking the initiative in the supply of some #commodities on the international market, as well as enhancing cooperation with third world countries are among the key measures #China can take to effectively
465 2018-09-04 02:02:11 I’m not sure aboot China dumping US bonds since commodities on the world market like oil have to be purchased in US dollars.  Hoarding when bond prices are low for future purchases is smart. Dumping them in retaliation only to buy them back is a huge risk

467 2018-09-04 01:41:08 Não amigo, a alta das commodities obviamente fez diferença mas não explica tudo o que ocorreu. Assim como a queda do petróleo e cenário externo desfavorável não isenta o governo Dilma dos erros internos.
468 2018-09-04 01:36:55 Seriously though kawawa talaga yung dati ng hirap lalo pa silang maghihirap. Kahit anong kayod sa taas ng bilihin kahit basic commodities sobrang mahal na.
469 2018-09-04 01:35:23 Tudo isso foi consequência. A causa: aumento do preço das commodities no mercado Internacional. Os dados comprovam isso isso e melhor prova não há do que o castelinho de carta ruindo ainda durante o governo Lula e país destruído ainda durante o teatro PTista.
470 2018-09-04 01:31:48 Não foi de forma alguma apenas devido ao preço das commodities.

Como mencionei, a redistribuição de renda foi um fato. Houve redução da pobreza, aumento real do salário mínimo, maior acesso ao crédito, e investimentos públicos. Há dados claros demonstrando isto tudo.
471 2018-09-04 01:29:53 Would you like it done to you? Just because we can enslave, torture and kill them doesn't make it right. We mass bred them like commodities, I guess if you spare yourself from viewing what we do to them it can easily justify you defending it.
472 2018-09-04 01:26:40 #Petróleo | #Argelia dice mercado petrolero mundial está en equilibrio.  #Oil #Prices #Commodities
473 2018-09-04 01:25:59 Tudo isso às custas do preço de commodities no mercado Internacional, e sem plantar uma semente para o futuro. A merda veio logo, no meio do segundo mandato, com a crise de 2008 e esse bosta não tinha plantado nada, só favores pra manter cabresto nos coitados dos pobres.
474 2018-09-04 01:16:09 The essential consideration is that all commodities follow gold....in terms of price. Why would a country peg to oil when its price is a derivative of gold? There is only one element that is ‘money par excellence’ and that is gold. #JudeToldYouSo
475 2018-09-04 01:15:53 I think focusing solely commodity crop farm support is putting too fine a point on it. The crop support is a small but integral part of a much larger program of an agricultural policy that has led us to a food system dominated by certain commodities.
476 2018-09-04 01:14:56 Yes, but there is many other jobs you can work expect trading. Don't be pathetic! Today everyone run paid groups, but I want to ask you all how many years are you actively trading U.S stock market, forex, commodities?
477 2018-09-04 01:06:21 "Você entende de commodities?"

hahahahahahahahaha #SegundoSol
478 2018-09-04 01:01:50 The Sacklers did not neglect this young lady to death. Nevada's court system and jail administrators did because people with addiction don't matter. They commodities for fee generation. Shame on Nevada court system for creating this dehumanizing environment.
479 2018-09-04 00:54:06 Uyu anorwara uyu. What development in all those projects? Why focus on infrastructure instead of basic commodities first.

483 2018-09-04 00:25:34 La Russia fa solo commodities, gioca a tutto campo
484 2018-09-04 00:23:13 Grains should be on the same schedule as Crude, Gold and Silver. All commodities should be open at the same time.
485 2018-09-04 00:04:47 One cannot simply take a Model S battery pack and put it into the LEAF or even a Model 3. Tesla cannot even take the cells of the Model 3 pack and put into an S without substantial redesign. It matters little if cells become commodities; battery packs are not.
486 2018-09-04 00:00:07 To him they are only commodities to be used- nothing  more.
