1 2019-01-24 23:58:33 Yes I understand the principle I just have no idea why taxing houses but not stocks is consistent with equal protection, but taxing both houses and stocks is somehow inconsistent with it. I don't think either option is problematic in principle.
2 2019-01-24 23:58:29 Stocks are not cheap, and this VIX isn't dropping enough... What one is being held up by BS?
3 2019-01-24 23:58:27 Ce serait pas mal pour les nourrissons de prévoir la livraison en urgence de stocks de produits d’autres marques que celle incriminée, à base de protéines de riz afin de répondre à la demande sanitaire des enfants de moins 6 mois qui ne peuvent se nourrir sans ces produits...non?

6 2019-01-24 23:57:47 Sue @GoldmanSachs for last minute downgrade on @Starbucks stock just before their earnings report. Preventing a big breakout in share price. Utter option price manipulation on their hand. #wallstreet #stocks #banks #investmentbank

14 2019-01-24 23:52:53 Also, looks like after Wald video, Guy Adami made it his final trade for tomorrow.  That was probably the delay in price move.  I didn't know FM guys can still move stocks.
15 2019-01-24 23:52:40 Analysts, investors and traders. CEOs are not the ones selling the stocks. CEOs are there to do their best. A higher level employee. They will never call for a recession in front of a board. When did they?
