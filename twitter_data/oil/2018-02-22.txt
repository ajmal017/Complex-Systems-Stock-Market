53 2018-02-22 23:56:06 Putin was mostly staying out of the way in the M.E. since 0bama claimed to be handling lSIS. lSIS kept spreading and reportedly earned a Billion dollars from oil refining, so Russia stepped in and began bombing lSIS which helped all of us. What on earth was 0bama really doing?

57 2018-02-22 23:55:45 Time will tell, sir. They deserve benefit of the doubt the same as every other person. How about in the meantime you ban gun lobbyists. While you're at it ban Tobacco, Alcohol, Big Pharma, Big Oil, and every other merchant of evil greed and death I'm leaving out.
58 2018-02-22 23:55:43 But that tea tree oil though...

62 2018-02-22 23:55:02 Unfortunately that won't be possible as they tend to keep Lucas Oil as quiet as possible. They literally only allow whisper-level talking.
63 2018-02-22 23:54:55 gretz best points guy but maybe not best all round player on the oil even mess gives him a run there...mario best i ever saw period(oiler fan)
64 2018-02-22 23:54:46 I'm ready to rage when oilers win it #rigged for oil country
65 2018-02-22 23:54:38 As the #USA continues to look the other way #RoyalMaya continues to make great progress. Our strategic Allies see the value in a new sovereign nation backed by a #Gold and #Silver currency. Our nations and its people will prosper thru trade, oil, and a stable currency.
66 2018-02-22 23:54:36 I put food in a ripping hot skillet of oil and some of it splashed onto my eyelid and I’ve never really felt pain until just now.
67 2018-02-22 23:54:29 Russia probably offered him a cut of that Rosneft oil deal if he and trump could get sanctions lifted.
68 2018-02-22 23:54:07 A few drops of oil in which chicken was fried fell into a pot of rice. If it's batul b'shishim can the rice be used for sushi?
69 2018-02-22 23:53:45 Our oil industry is walking the walk, they are always improving and complying to regulations.Our energy industry has the best record in the world. If you are looking for perfection it's not going to happen. Didn't your parents teach you that
70 2018-02-22 23:53:37 2) which is EXACTLY why Tillerson was influentially recommended (by Bob Gates/Condoleeza Rice Joint Lobbying Co) for Sec of State. Russia has NO ECONOMIC power except Nat Gas and Oil. Sink 'em on this.
71 2018-02-22 23:53:36 “You have a got secret cabal that’s actually running the world and they’ve managed to keep this technology under wraps until they can cash in the trillions of oil assets that they’ve got,” he said at an Alien Expo conference last June that recently surfaced on social media
72 2018-02-22 23:53:27 And you can't lose the war
When you sell the guns
Your car runs on oil as thick as blood
73 2018-02-22 23:53:12 nah international energy organizations or investment materials by banks.  Even if cars and power production were all oil and gas free, there's still increasing need for things produced with oil and gas as a base
74 2018-02-22 23:52:50 the Burt’s bees oil cleanser + witch hazel combo saved my life
75 2018-02-22 23:52:26 Fake news.  Under Harper two entirely new oil pipelines were approved and built: Keystone, non  XL from Alberta to Nebraska, and The Alberta Clipper adding 1.25-million barrels a day of pipeline capacity.
76 2018-02-22 23:52:16 If you’re trying to grow your hair out, do the inversion method and I recommend using Jamaican castor oil, Thank me later lol!
77 2018-02-22 23:52:16 the one thing we do talk about is the common oil leaks 
78 2018-02-22 23:52:10 Yup I know ppl like what though oil change breaks things like that
79 2018-02-22 23:52:06 Oil Nut Bay was awesome today though. Really had a time. And they treated us exceptionally well!
80 2018-02-22 23:52:00 My hands have so much essential oil on them that I'm pretty sure I've thrown my phone ten times now.
81 2018-02-22 23:51:34 @GovHolcomb 1) Congratulations on passing Sunday Alcohol. Who says republicans can't pass meaningful legislation? I do. Millions of us do. My 11 year old grandson can't get CBD oil in Indiana so he gets filled with big-pharma poison. That poison affects his health,his school work

83 2018-02-22 23:51:22 She says the coast belongs to all of Canada . . . just like the oil? 
84 2018-02-22 23:51:16 It seems helicopters fly out of Norwich airport to North Sea oil rigs. It's definitely not my secret lair...
85 2018-02-22 23:51:05 interesting... I could connect with him on painting since I oil paint too, but not on any other level. you just started some thought-provoking thread for sure!
86 2018-02-22 23:51:02 Tea tree oil really be doing my skin justice
87 2018-02-22 23:50:59 You don't even know the answer to these questions, yet you're okay with a 7 fold increase in tanker traffic off our coast? @bcliberals will jeopardize BC so a Texas Oil company in Alberta can increase its profit margins.

88 2018-02-22 23:50:43 I disagree, he was just another right wing snake oil salesmen.
89 2018-02-22 23:50:39 "I recently came here to get an oil change, and a few days later I thought my car needed more oil because it was shaking so i put some more oil" who the fuck told you to put more oil.... Idiot

92 2018-02-22 23:50:22 "Putin has big plans for Russia. He wants to edge out its neighbors so that Russia can dominate oil supplies to all of Europe," Trump said. "I respect Putin and Russians but cannot believe our leader (Obama) allows them to get away with so much...Hats off to the Russians."
93 2018-02-22 23:50:05 Barry did talk, and with TelePrompTers.  A lot.  There was even travel involved, and ya know how much work packing is.  That took some effort. And also, he faked a tear with pepper oil.  That had to sting. So give him some credit.
94 2018-02-22 23:49:47 My cousins here a debate on the levels of obnoxiousness that we going to reach if the oil money start flow right
95 2018-02-22 23:49:46 I enjoyed seeing George Galloway on the television more when he was facing allegations in the US Senate for taking oil money from Saddam Hussein's regime. He doesn't like me bringing this up. #blockedbygalloway #bbcqtw
96 2018-02-22 23:49:37 Large fire in #Barwick #Yeovil involing a heating oil tank and 2 bungalows, crews from #Yeovil, #Martock #Sherborn #Taunton in attendance and dealing with it. All persons accounted for.
97 2018-02-22 23:49:20 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
98 2018-02-22 23:48:51 Both #bcpoli and #abpoli need to act like actual leaders and step back from this rhetoric; must allow the pipelines to move forward exactly as they have been legally planned.  First BC/Alberta death(s) by rail or road transport of oil? Falls directly on shoulders of the #BCNDP
99 2018-02-22 23:48:38 My theory on him, in particular, is that his public stance is a climate-change denier.  In actuality, he has seen so much information from reputable geologists and scientists on climate change, that he's conceded we're past the point of no return.  Chasing oil $$$ is his god.
100 2018-02-22 23:48:37 @ChickfilA getting disrespected a second time at your store, you people could’ve at least reached out with an apology. I mean the food was horrible, down to the oil being really old and gave food nasty taste. I’m definitely never going back and I hope other people  as well
101 2018-02-22 23:48:27 Putang ina inutos niyo na lahat wag lang yung change oil puta

103 2018-02-22 23:47:52 I do all of them TBH. But never Tesco now. I can buy several brands of olive oil, coffee, biscuits. 

Only one brand of sugar though. Sonething dodgy going on there
104 2018-02-22 23:47:40 You'reorrect about Putin's agenda - recreation of USSR, despite the fact they only have one true global card to play currently - military/nuclear/major World power - UNTIL THEIR OIL IS FULLY RELEASED VIA MOBIL/EXXON/ROSNEFT DEAL OF THE CENTURY...1/2

108 2018-02-22 23:47:13 A fear that pushes us back on the the soap box and to the ballot box. Stop insinuating we are for armed confrontation. That tweet is so full of banana oil it's funny.

111 2018-02-22 23:46:32 So excited to try Grapeseed oil in my skin care routine. 
112 2018-02-22 23:46:11 If the budget made you feel good, let's not forget the horrific Site C decision and what is looking like a slow KM cave in. I suspect only the failing gas & oil economy will save us now, but will that crash come soon enough?
113 2018-02-22 23:45:50 Forgot Oil
114 2018-02-22 23:45:44 i remember they burned out a huge generator too by not putting oil in the fucking thing

how the fuck- ?????¿¿¿¿?????
115 2018-02-22 23:45:40 I think Nutley is play fighting. Where was her fight during Energy East campaign? Don't trust her. She hates oil industry. And farmers. And ranchers. And loggers.
116 2018-02-22 23:45:32 That oil pressure light tho
117 2018-02-22 23:45:21 There was no war in the middle East under labour, it was a heavy handed one way trade negotiation for oil
118 2018-02-22 23:45:19 Great. So now we can talk about getting "our (all of Canada's) oil" to "our (all of Canada's) coast". 
119 2018-02-22 23:45:15 I'm so thankful my bro changing my oil 
120 2018-02-22 23:45:14 Because it’s never been about humanitarian reasons. It’s been about fighting over oil and resources.
121 2018-02-22 23:45:05 I believe Cbd oil is good. Going to try it for my son. Currently, at 10 years old, he is on zoloft, Risperdal(sp) klonedine..He was born with a crack addiction. I took him from his mom. Wondering what I got myself into. He's worth it though. Had him 10 years
122 2018-02-22 23:45:00 Which is what every homeopath and snake oil salesman claims. 

Who needs evidence when you have confirmation bias? It's only children's futures.

126 2018-02-22 23:44:10 I thought he was referring to the UK when he mentioned oil rich country with starving citizens and queues.

129 2018-02-22 23:43:36 Middle East! We bomb the fuck out of it every chance we get. The ideology of jihad comes from the 1 country we don't bomb but we do sell arms to. Saudi Arabia; the maker & exporter of terrorism around the globe but because they sell us oil and buy warplanes they're OK #bbcqt

135 2018-02-22 23:42:55 Not always the most articulate JP, but he's spot on there. The war(s) in the Middle East are about oil and Western democracies wanting someone they don't like out and someone they do in; regardless of human cost #bbcqt
136 2018-02-22 23:42:39 Right. So if 'our coast' is destroyed from a catastrophic spill and all the tens of thousands jobs in hospitality and tourism in BC go bye bye (way more than the oil will create) it's going to affect BC not the rest of Canada.... #bcpoli

145 2018-02-22 23:41:20 OK, so I guess it's "our oil" and not just Alberta's?

151 2018-02-22 23:40:27 Oil provides over 6500 additional byproducts of which everybody uses - from plastic, cosmetics, asphalt ,shampoo , nylon , medicine , aspirin, lipstick. tooth brush, hair color . tools, cleansers, fuel. moisturizers, toothpaste, are a few. Yaba Daba Do !
152 2018-02-22 23:40:20 This divide's only going to get worse. We are anti-authoritarianism, anti-war, against fracking, Big Pharma, oil, Wall St. conservative centrist corporate politics. Dems are not. Not a purity test if unless you're well off financially and don't give a rat's ass about killing POC.
153 2018-02-22 23:40:19 No, nothing new and haven't dyed my hair recently either. So that's why I'm thinking it's a skin thing or if it's oil? I admit that I lack moisturizing and keeping a routine
154 2018-02-22 23:40:17 僕はただ油にこんにちはを言う練習をする。
155 2018-02-22 23:40:12 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
156 2018-02-22 23:39:51 @bbcquestiontime how is it possible to discuss Syria , without mentioning Russia ? And to discuss Brexit without mentioning Ireland . Russia has the oil/gas gun to our heads. #bbcqt

159 2018-02-22 23:39:28  This time , sweet . You can always add some chilli oil to spice it up . Thank you so much Adan !
160 2018-02-22 23:39:21 Maybe you ought to pass that along to Kenney. Not impressed with jobs & income as a dangle. They depend on the commodity prices. Oil tanks & the companies shrug & fold up but the rest of us have to carry on.
161 2018-02-22 23:39:19 Iv just started using the V E cleanser....would highly recommend. My skin is left soft and moistured all day without the oil you can get with most moisturisers. The spray is brilliant for settling make up too 
162 2018-02-22 23:39:13 Did you use coconut oil?
163 2018-02-22 23:38:49 Coconut oil feels great on the skin!
164 2018-02-22 23:38:36 Dinner tonight? 1/2 montreal seasoned hamburger patty (no bun) from @Publix topped with 1/2 slice gouda and a few baby bella mushrooms (slightly sauteed in olive oil). Dessert is 10 red raspberries (in an hour or so). #stuffed
165 2018-02-22 23:38:30 So the AB oil is "our oil?"
166 2018-02-22 23:38:21 A guy with an Australian accent was buying a Fosters oil can in front if me at CVS. He had a jacket that said "Wallaby" on the back, and a backpack that said "United States and Australia: 100 years of mateship." I think he's a plant. He's here to take our guns with his socialism.
167 2018-02-22 23:38:17 @BBCquestiontim to quote a song war what is it good for? Absolutely nothing unless of course you have an interest in what they have like oil for instance
168 2018-02-22 23:38:14 Also, Dear Jasmine: stop trying to take over the oil.  You only get, like, three drops in there, be good.
169 2018-02-22 23:38:13 Unless you live in Iraq, Libya, Honduras, Puerto Rico etc those places where you find it acceptable to regime change for oil and resources. Those "business opportunities"
170 2018-02-22 23:38:04 i'm getting little red bumps along my hair line/near my baby hairs and idk if it's from oil or what but it's really not cute 
171 2018-02-22 23:38:02 All started in 1976 when the AD goverment seized the US and other multinat. oil corps. The biggest mistake in Vz contemporary history. It took only 7 years for the first devaluation of the Bs4,3/US!. From then on, this has been a toboggan 'til today at Bs230MM/US$1. TEMPTATION!

175 2018-02-22 23:36:40 It looks like a movie that Adam Sandler would star in? 
176 2018-02-22 23:36:35 Were the credible reports all produced by oil companies?
177 2018-02-22 23:36:30 .@RachelNotley says Alberta could still bring back the wine ban and other retaliatory measures if they think B.C. is messing with investment around pipelines and oil #ableg
178 2018-02-22 23:35:45 WTH he put all the cooking oil o que 
179 2018-02-22 23:35:44 Y’all use coconut oil as lube?
180 2018-02-22 23:35:27 Dont forget to order your CBD OIL before you run out
181 2018-02-22 23:35:26 New #POLL for an upcoming theme magazine: While medical marijuana is legal in #Florida, you can only have it in the processed form: an oil, an edible, a topical or vaporized. Smoking it is illegal. 
But do you agree? Should smoking #medicalmarijuana be legal or illegal? #Health
182 2018-02-22 23:35:20 Er, because US/UK/UN want the #Oil & #Pipelines - & because it furthers #Israel's agenda to dominate the Middle East. #Iran is next..
183 2018-02-22 23:35:19 Yes they are different grades of oil, however the differential is causing us to sell our “Chevy” at “Kia” prices due to many factors including pipeline(s), it’s challenging the economics on many projects that provide employment, activity, etc. Projects mean jobs and income.
184 2018-02-22 23:34:57 Certain fires are actually stopped with other fires, from using demolitions to stop oil well fires to back burning on forest fires.  But hey, your plan of "the only person armed is the guy carrying out a mass murder" has only failed completely so why save lives? #CampusCarry now
185 2018-02-22 23:34:53 Where all those madow wanna bes? nacala idinkua yaala.
If these peopel and us were the same people, would we be having this conversation?  We ain't the same people like oil and water, we dont fucking mix.
186 2018-02-22 23:34:51 Are you talking about a particular sheriff in Florida?
187 2018-02-22 23:34:40 Preventable?  The oil industry knew the effects of increased CO2 decades ago and put profit over people.  Are future even worse extreme weather events preventable? You decide.
188 2018-02-22 23:34:34 aS IF SOFI DRANK OIL JUST FOR A DARE
189 2018-02-22 23:34:33 Listen you didn't book an appointment ! Bookings are Monday -Friday. Otherwise you get me answering with coconut oil on my face kmt
190 2018-02-22 23:34:26 it’s time to get another oil change and it’s crazy bc I just got one alittle over a month ago

193 2018-02-22 23:33:51 Sadly, yes
194 2018-02-22 23:33:31 Alberta Premier @rachelnotley says B.C never had the right to block oil shipments, calls move an attack on investors. “BC is stepping back from the brink and abiding by the law.” Alberta will immediately drop the wine ban.
#ableg #bcpoli
195 2018-02-22 23:33:29 Until they put more oil in the ground and try to change the de facto USD$barrel pricing structure......
196 2018-02-22 23:33:22 Presumably a pipeline would allow shipments of oil to fast growing regions where demand for oil is high. Like I don't know, India perhaps?
197 2018-02-22 23:33:21 Is this real life? 
198 2018-02-22 23:32:59 Yes bio oil definitely didn’t work  yes everybody body will naturally do what it’s gon do
199 2018-02-22 23:32:52 tacos are life ... i can always get another shirt lol ... i just realized all my shirts have taco oil or clorox stains 
200 2018-02-22 23:32:50 .@RachelNotley says BC is “shelving its threat” to regulate oil from pipelines. Not sure @jjhorgan would agree. However, she calls it a “small victory” and says BC is “stepping back from the brink." 
Therefore, Alberta will drop its wine ban, she says.
201 2018-02-22 23:32:46  no. I got my nails done, bought oil for my car and put gas in it
202 2018-02-22 23:32:40 Keeping car maintained is a must. Oil changes , tires ,  tires rotated , brakes inspections ,  it’s expensive  but if you want car to last you have to
203 2018-02-22 23:32:25 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!

213 2018-02-22 23:30:37 NIXON was president! Nothing changing war happened in first term, but spring of ‘71, hearts & minds were def changing (eff. of moratorium,Pent. Papers)-‘73 serious drawdown started. Then oil crisis & S.V. economy crashed, North took offensive spring ‘75.
214 2018-02-22 23:30:31 The rhino rolled his shoulders a little before continuing to wash the oil off the rest of his body.

“I appreciate the help. It’s way too hard to get the oil off from there on my own.”
215 2018-02-22 23:30:26 @MoPNG_eSeva .
When will we get LPG Cylinder with seals of better quality, where tampering can be detected easily by a common consumer. 
At present we are not able to detect if a seal is tempered or not, inspire of Oil Companies claim of the seals being tamper evident.

217 2018-02-22 23:30:23 “Don’t Forget Your Change!” is the reminder from this helpful canine cashier in a 1960s AC oil filters ad #TBT
218 2018-02-22 23:30:17 oh I forgot to give this too 

Biscuits made with fish oil? How about it?  I have to think about it in my dream somehow!
219 2018-02-22 23:30:17 Hey @GordonRamsay in what oil/butter would you suggest for cooking steak in an iron skillet?
220 2018-02-22 23:30:10 oh cut the bullshit, you’re a shill for a giant Texas based oil company.
221 2018-02-22 23:30:09 Can you imagine the stench of the fish oil spill on the Western Ring Road, especially in this heat *vom*
222 2018-02-22 23:30:06 That is a law fool
223 2018-02-22 23:30:03 Is that oil and business so important? ??,?
224 2018-02-22 23:30:00 Somehow I got oregano essential oil on my hands and my hands have smelled like a goddamn pizza scratch-and-sniff sticker all day long.
225 2018-02-22 23:29:53 There's the Sierra Club at work again, helping to keep Alberta dependent on only south-bound pipelines for its oil sales (except a small volume through @TransMtn)
226 2018-02-22 23:29:45 My husband threw a bottle of Omega 3 pills at me!  Fortunately my injuries were only super fish oil.  #punthursday
227 2018-02-22 23:29:40 It's oil receipts.. As long as oil prices are high enough and pipelines aren't blown that'll increase + they've augmented that with borrowings as well
228 2018-02-22 23:29:39 91.3FM The Edge is playing "Oil And Water [Album Version]" by Incubus.
229 2018-02-22 23:29:30 This lady is doing a fantastic job rubbing this warm oil on my feet. This is the best pedicure I’ve had in a while. 
230 2018-02-22 23:29:27 I need a hot oil treatment
231 2018-02-22 23:29:20 Hi. My apologies as I'm losing the thread of the conversation. If UR referring to commercial laundry detergents & fabric softener, please avoid. Get laundry detergent from a health food store. Not sure there is a natural version of fabric softener. Oil based face creams stimulate

I should fly down to Venezuela and cash out my life savings and all my Crypto to invest in their new oil back Cryptocurrency.

You know what I did?

I grabbed my shotgun and went on a little birdy hunt.
239 2018-02-22 23:26:59 Go Oil Capitals Go!
240 2018-02-22 23:26:51 .012 does look good support as the BOE isn't that great a number in the big picture. Plus oil not the hottest thing at present.
241 2018-02-22 23:26:34 babe can we share the oil pan
242 2018-02-22 23:26:33 : let them know how appreciated they have a touch of Brown & olive oil crackers, Vino e Formaggio "Asiago" cheeses - packed in this trio
243 2018-02-22 23:25:50 In Norway they use the oil money for the winter sports, and it shows in the results.
244 2018-02-22 23:25:41 I gotta order my oil filter
245 2018-02-22 23:25:10 Well, somebody does. I guess the “detailed inspection” with the oil change doesn’t include “starting.”
246 2018-02-22 23:25:03 Oil r in such disarray 
247 2018-02-22 23:24:42 The Chinese follow the Sun Tzu playbook. Let’s see how/what the long awaited, said to be up and running in one month’s time, oil bourse achieves by way of changing the game.
248 2018-02-22 23:24:03 That's one of the places I've stumbled upon. ;) The stock is $OIL. But after the first page of search results it's just about oil in general.
249 2018-02-22 23:23:59 When you get your oil changed without your parents telling you too...adulting
250 2018-02-22 23:23:46 How is electricity generation tied to oil?
251 2018-02-22 23:23:20 Did Mr Holness say when we actually stopped getting oil from Venezuela? Who are we getting oil from, if we stopped? Did he provide documentation?

254 2018-02-22 23:23:03 Most comical is that people say war in middle east has nothing to do with religion but everything to do with oil and some Zionist plan, this conspiracy crap what is killing us thanks for the help.

259 2018-02-22 23:22:07 Within Horgan’s referral to the courts of whether B.C. has jurisdiction to protect its coastline is a subtle suggestion to Notley. The most contentious aspect of the #pipevine spat is going to the bar. #bcpoli #abpoli #oil #wine
260 2018-02-22 23:22:06 Brilliant! I've never heard of using any Coconut Oil! Must look that up! ^Zanne
261 2018-02-22 23:21:38 We should be doing just as much to protect our school children as we do to protect our country against terrorist attacks.
262 2018-02-22 23:21:30 Well... the egg flavor was a bit too strong. I was told not to use olive oil, but I didn't have cooking oil xD

Next time I'll try adding a Portuguese spin and just put in onion and garlic instead
263 2018-02-22 23:21:09 I just don't know what the hurry of shipping it out is. It's Canadian peoples oil.

266 2018-02-22 23:20:30 no I think I stay away from oils because I have oily/combination skin and like oil= whiteheads in my mind.
267 2018-02-22 23:20:26 @BBCNews at 22:00h again talks about the TRAGIC situation currently in Venezuela!!! How an inept and corrupt administration has ruined the country with the highest oil reserves in the world!
268 2018-02-22 23:20:17 Maybe he should have been more “defensive” BEFORE the murder...
269 2018-02-22 23:20:11 Absolutely. I’m arguing nothing should be off the table, including more gun control. These are extremely complex issues, requiring complex, holistic solutions (in my opinion)

278 2018-02-22 23:18:59 AH! But it's ok for the SNP to misinform and expect the public to make decisions based on that... Think about oil, promises to get into the EU straight after the referendum in 2014, about a once in a generation opportunity, currency etc. etc.
279 2018-02-22 23:18:35 When you thought grandmas were supposed to come with the holy oil  lmfao not 2018 grandmas 
280 2018-02-22 23:17:48 I can understand! Baking soda is very cheap. Google it. I just put oil in it so my house smells like peppermint. But it will help for sure and it may cost 1,29.
281 2018-02-22 23:17:47 Bull its about thinking we are above the law. Typical left ploy. The Canadian Government has approved the pipeline, Alberta is suffering from the big drop in oil and gas. We are first Canadians and then British Columbians. I hope we get penalized and penalized big! Jerks.

300 2018-02-22 23:14:47 I just eat cottage cheese, cheese sticks, baby bel, and a whole avocado daily, and put olive oil in my veggies. Seems to help makeup the macros for my fat
301 2018-02-22 23:14:43 trump's denial of global warming is based entirely on the fact that he and his 1% buddies can make a lot of money off of oil.
He only cares about himself and money.
302 2018-02-22 23:14:32 Funny that you never mentioned some agreed to pipelines and oil sands expansion.
303 2018-02-22 23:14:14 Oil change, new filter and tire rotation for $21, FUCK YESS! 
304 2018-02-22 23:14:08  and i dripping oil down my hands ... i think to myself "damn it i got it on my shirt again"
305 2018-02-22 23:14:06 Ya I’ve seen the John Wayne movie. Your house is not an oil well. Unless it is then get the fuck out!
306 2018-02-22 23:13:59 An oil seep doesn't mean that we have Guyana or Trinidad levels of oil ... but it's still promising
307 2018-02-22 23:13:53 sorry they lied to you my friend  ppl throw coconut oil as a remedy for everything. it’s going to do nothing but make you’re hair oily. to actually moisture it you need a moisturizer. to lock in moisture you then use a small amount of coconut oil 
308 2018-02-22 23:13:52 yas so like the fcc has a set date to take away net neutrality, but like congress/ numerous lawyers within the next 10 days plan to challenge them in court. Im ready to watch this fight
309 2018-02-22 23:13:28 I could make the fanciest dinners, I’m talking truffle oil and capers spending freaking 3 hours prepping and cooking. You know what gets these mfs excited? Breakfast for dinner. I live with peasants.

313 2018-02-22 23:13:00 Eww gross! I know baking soda absorbs smells. You can have for instance a cup of baked soda, drop in oil like peppermint into it and put is insice he bag. If it smells on the outside too put it all in a garbagebag. It will absorb.
314 2018-02-22 23:12:57 SORRY. CORN FIRST, OIL SECOND. YOU CAN START A FIRE IF YOU ADD OIL TO ANYTHING TO A POPCORN POPPER.
315 2018-02-22 23:12:12 Why, when saving the guys on the oil tanker, as he's holding up final beam before it all came crashing down, did the camera pan to #HenryCavill's abs? Smh. We get it. He's jacked. Him walking around with his shirt off was enough. Don't create scenes for the audience. #ManOfSteel

334 2018-02-22 23:09:38 Why does the rest of the world watch this happening ? It can’t just be oil?
335 2018-02-22 23:09:28 Oh I agree it’s much deeper. Just as terrorism is much deeper than mere TSA checkpoint improvement. But that doesn’t mean we didn’t impliment MANY TSA regulations.
336 2018-02-22 23:09:24 Dolphins are more energetic, so Dolphin oil would be more effective.

Most of #Beni killings have taken place within an area where #Total has been conducting seismic testing in preparation for oil drilling.
AND
The #French army has been training Uganda’s army in mountainous terrain along the Uganda-Congo border.
338 2018-02-22 23:09:11 Exfoliation during the shower (usually w apricot scrub)
DAB face dry w a clean towel
Moistureize with a non-oil based moisturizer 
Dab tea tree oil on any acne    and most important, stay hydrated w that young H2O

Also natural face soaps help

So Museveni developed designs on the oil deposits of #Beni— a #DRC smuggling hub for natural resources into Uganda & Rwanda, & onto world markets that Kagame had been attempting to control for years.
340 2018-02-22 23:09:05 6/
Total agreed to build Uganda the heated oil pipeline, but experts argued that the scheme wouldn’t be cost-effective unless the oil on the eastern #DRC region of #Beni, flows through it, too
341 2018-02-22 23:09:03 5/
New Twist: Uganda’s 6bn barrels oil find is thick & waxy, getting it to the Indian Ocean will require running it through the WORLD’S LONGEST HEATED PIPELINE, which quadruples the cost of transport relative to that for ordinary crude oil.
342 2018-02-22 23:08:59 3/
The attraction beneath #DRC’s soil was an estimated (2011 prices) $24 trillion in natural resources, including oil, gold, diamonds, coltan, cobalt, nickel, copper, uranium, iron....
343 2018-02-22 23:08:53 I'm definitely trying the peppermint oil tonight! Stress has been affecting my sleep a lot so I'm trying anything
344 2018-02-22 23:08:52 Are they under siege by the Americans for oil? Or does that play no part?
345 2018-02-22 23:08:52 Thats okay! @lisamurkowski plan is to destroy Alaska, it's national parks, it's wildlife and put everyone on the oil dole. This works for her #GOPTaxScam
346 2018-02-22 23:08:40 Hey, we know that guy (second from left)! NorQuest College Assistive Technology Specialist, Lorne Webber hanging with the Oil! Looking forward to seeing him play goal for the Edmonton SeeHawks at the national championships in April
347 2018-02-22 23:08:38 Right now @IndyEleven is looking into opening up more stands for our games at Lucas Oil. We’d have filled up the small section they had dedicated for us with just the group that showed up to the preseason game today.

352 2018-02-22 23:08:13 Maybe i should get the speedo's and the baby oil out Kate
353 2018-02-22 23:08:04 Not at all - that's sort of my point: 1 tonne CO2, be it from oilsands or car tailpipes in YVR, is still 1 tonne CO2. Restricting oil sands supply while maintaining demand for its products reduces GHGs only (mostly) by the emission intensity difference of replacement supply.
354 2018-02-22 23:07:59 Not true government under siege from America over oil. Look it up
355 2018-02-22 23:07:53 My skin is so dry. No amount of oil or exfoliation can resolve this issue
356 2018-02-22 23:07:38 Of course. It, consumers only notice what comes out of their pocket via paper bills. If the dodo really hit the fan, everything would be a lot more expensive. If we ever have another world oil crisis we would all be up the creek without a paddle.
357 2018-02-22 23:07:35 Question Today: 'Can we just add peppermint oil to TPN for functional abd pain?' #educationmoment - umm no - and if you do it will only be once bc pt will prob not need TPN any more  #sigh #rdnstruggles #tpn #thinkpeople

359 2018-02-22 23:07:21 <3 Never having used one myself, have you tried a neti pot? My best friend swears they're amazing, etc etc. Alternately, what I usually do, is go start a shower as hot as I can get it, then stand there in the steam with my head back. And some menthol essential oil? In a diffuser?

363 2018-02-22 23:06:51 On the Crude Oil front last night’s API data showed a draw of 907 thousand barrels when expectations were counting on a build 2.9 million barrels. In the overnight electronic session the April Crude Oil is currently  trading at 6158 which is 10 tics lower.
364 2018-02-22 23:06:44 Now, we need oil and cigarette companies to complete the trifecta.

Boys

Let's settle this in a civil way

With you two oil wrestling and me being the ref 
366 2018-02-22 23:06:33 no, i'll have to check the ingredients in it. i don't use fabric softener anymore either. my skin cream is not oil based, either, and it's all natural. i very rarely drink coffee, tea in the morning 2-3 times a week, 2-3 bottles of water a day. i sleep okay, but i wake up a lot.
367 2018-02-22 23:06:21 @Gidi_Traffic  Dear fam, pls I'm in need of a 33k litres vegetable oil tanker , to load from shagamu to onitsha, rch me on 08063987683
368 2018-02-22 23:06:20 Then roast some olive oil drizzled veggies on a pan w garlic then salt n pepper them and you could add a small salad with a good fatty dressing like an avocado based one or my fav snack of diced tomato and avocado with cilantro and lime and salt squeezed on top 
369 2018-02-22 23:06:09 i thought i was slicker than car oil but i guess not

372 2018-02-22 23:05:47 LaPierre needs to put the fucking crack pipe down! We need to force special interest groups out of politics. Oil companies, NRA, drug companies and the like have NO place in a FREE AND FAIR political system. Their money is dirty and ideas based on lies and racism!
373 2018-02-22 23:05:28 Are they trying to follow the mysterious Russian Rosneft$$ oil trail? Follow the money is an age old way to find the culprits.
374 2018-02-22 23:05:21 Trying to figure out where she thinks she’s wearing this sexy smelling oil she purchased today.

Wow.
What a waste of money since no one will get to smell it on her. 
375 2018-02-22 23:05:20 It was an event.  We got to stay up late, order pizza and drink Grand Prix pop.  

Not to mention, popcorn.  None of that air popped or microwave stuff either.  Stove top in a pot with oil and slathered in butter and salt.
376 2018-02-22 23:05:17 watching Blood & Oil
377 2018-02-22 23:05:11 Remind me to never use the dealership shuttle when I drop off my car for an oil change ever again... Nothing like sitting at work for 90 minutes while you wait for a ride.
378 2018-02-22 23:04:56 I had a 9am appointment at @FirestoneTires to get my flat tire  fixed and an oil change and they told me it would be done by 4.. I showed up at 4:20 to my car in the same spot as last night with the flat tire still. Ugh.
379 2018-02-22 23:04:39 Oil well fires actually are put out by an explosion,which uses up the oxygen and smothers the fire. Strange but true.

382 2018-02-22 23:04:13 Goes well with olive oil
383 2018-02-22 23:03:44 Since all of that oil has to be imported into resource-poor  Puerto  Rico, it’s not surprising that the island’s electricity cost per   kilowatt/hour is just over 25 cents. This is about twice the average  for  the U.S. mainland.
384 2018-02-22 23:03:39 The U.S. Energy Information Agency found that in 2016, Puerto Rico generated 47 percent of its energy from petroleum. By comparison, on the mainland  oil has accounted for less than one-half of one percent of energy  production.
385 2018-02-22 23:03:28 When plastic came out Dow/Dupont & oil tycoons said hemp would be disasterous for their new plastic business. Thats why hemp/marijuana was criminalized.
The shareholders had pals Herst Pub. do a smear campaign against it. 9 months later it was outlawed. Plastic is made from oil.
386 2018-02-22 23:03:27 slapped coconut oil
387 2018-02-22 23:03:14 Best thing about Trudeau?... My Canadian friends no longer give me grieve about Trump.
388 2018-02-22 23:02:55 i hate getting my oil changed, it just reminds me how shitty my car is!
389 2018-02-22 23:02:46 Any adulting above work is stressful and gives me hella anxiety. With that being said I got my brakes and oil change done in one day and I’m exhausted.
390 2018-02-22 23:02:41 Real mayo should be creamy in color, not white, with flecks of orange. The ingredients are oil, egg yolk, salt, cayenne or white pepper, vinegar or lemon juice, and mustard. Nothing else!

398 2018-02-22 23:01:24 Roy, 
Would me posting videos from fox news or the NRA sway you at all?  

That's what this is to me. 

The NRA is a membership driven organization. That's why we have cards. 

We have a SAY in it's direction. 

Drug or oil comps aren't membership driven. It's board directed.

400 2018-02-22 23:01:18 I don't believe it is strictly based on self defense, although that is a part of it. Common usage and and update with an advancement in technology are factors as well.
401 2018-02-22 23:01:13 My dad taught me how to change my oil :-) but lmao I don’t think I’d ever do this on my own bc I’m not strong enough to loosen/tighten the bolt under the engine
402 2018-02-22 23:01:00 Tried like 5 different joints—avoid anything w fragrance, hard to match w deodorant, gel, body lotion, oil and cologne

404 2018-02-22 23:00:52 Why do I feel a heavy nauseous feeling in the middle of an oil change? Fml.
405 2018-02-22 23:00:50 Is the laundry detergent from a health food store? I dropped fabric softener altogether. I'm not sure there is a natural version. RU using an oil based skin cream on your face at night? Re coffee/tea/water how much do U drink of each during the day? Quality of sleep at night?
406 2018-02-22 23:00:50 The low heart disease rate associated with a Mediterranean diet is in spite of olive oil—not because of it!

408 2018-02-22 23:00:41 Rob did (though not on a farm). Had to drive at the back of the pack due to the combo fuel mix of gas/oil stinking everyone out. GREEN MACHINE was its nickname.
409 2018-02-22 23:00:35 Ch.12 interesting fact; Exxon spent $2 billion on the cleanup of their 1989 oil spill and still ended up with a tarnished image. #cppcom101
410 2018-02-22 23:00:35 But I think that cooked spinach goes best w/ tomatoes (in spaghetti sauce for example) or lentils (or lentils and tomatoes). Or plain boiled. Sautéed isn't my favorite way either, but def better w/o the oil. [of course I really prefer spinach w/ tomatoes and potatoes]

441 2018-02-22 22:56:11 "Land is the new gold. Food  is the new oil."@DrLenoreNewman keynote address at #urbanagriculture forum #UAF2018 today. Great day exploring edible Cities for a thriving future . From resilience to liveability.
442 2018-02-22 22:56:03 A cynical person might think their goal is not preventing deaths but rather the taking of guns from law abiding citizens.
443 2018-02-22 22:55:55 Celebrating our 1st successful day at the WWETT S HOW 2018 meeting wonderful people at the show and at the LUCAS OIl STADIUM!!!
444 2018-02-22 22:55:52 I have to wonder if this is about stealing oil again.
445 2018-02-22 22:55:52 I know it's not the same as medication but I can send you some oil blends that will take a little of the edge off? Say yes I really want too
446 2018-02-22 22:55:46 I get that, but certainly Vegas and this FL shooting teach us they can still do incredible damage, more than say, a hand gun, can do, no?
447 2018-02-22 22:55:44 Semoga Petro crypto currency pegged w/oil reserved bisa bikin kelen keluar dari krisis
448 2018-02-22 22:55:10 do u know if that eyeliner is oil free so you can use it when u have lashes extensions?! I’ve been trying to find a good one 
449 2018-02-22 22:55:05 What's the deal with $CPG? Light oil producer, assets in both the US & Canada, growing every year, yet the stock is down massively. Debt is $4 billion, but they recently put non-core assets up for sale to pay them off. Why is this not at $15 or $20?
450 2018-02-22 22:54:57 The purpose and design of an AR 15 is for hunting, defense and target shooting. The fully automated machine gun was designed and is used for one purpose - war.
451 2018-02-22 22:54:32 The tire was easily repaired. I got that done and an oil change. Then I went back to work to be productive and got smacked around by shenanigans.
452 2018-02-22 22:54:07 Yet I presume you want more benefits for the poor, aboriginals, etc.

Hindering our economy doesn't just stick it to whoever or whatever you dislike about the oil industry. It hurts everyone relying on the tax revenue from that economic activity.
453 2018-02-22 22:54:04 それは艦隊決戦ボイスだと思う。最終決戦だから多少はね？
454 2018-02-22 22:54:02 Factorio stream wrapped! Got lots of train stuff done. Next time (Monday), even more expansion! We need stone, oil, and more on our network still. See you Saturday for Slay the Spire, or potentially an extra stream tomorrow!
455 2018-02-22 22:53:44 Thank God I'm not Canadian. I'd be in jail for shooting this fool.
456 2018-02-22 22:53:42 Ruby got an oil change , new tires  and alignment. I can travel cross the world right now.

466 2018-02-22 22:52:40 I mix the red pimento oil from Tropic Isle with Jamaican black castor oil... it works so well
467 2018-02-22 22:52:33 This pipeline thing reads as if an economist, a lawyer, and a politician rewrote Waiting for Godot and made it about oil.
468 2018-02-22 22:52:24 The Left don’t want to repeal the 2nd Amendment any more than they want to solve DACA.  The Left needs issues to remain so they fund raise claiming to be champions of change.  Democrats are the snake oil vendors of politics!!!
469 2018-02-22 22:52:22 That makes sense, I think. Seems to come down to how weapons for “self-defense” are determined, versus greater damage of higher power weapons. Does that seem right?
470 2018-02-22 22:52:13 There has never been much call for snake oil down in the DTES, so why would Bremner ever have been there before?

476 2018-02-22 22:51:51 Congratulations to Keshab Thapa, a doctoral student in Civil & Environmental Engineering for winning the NDSU Graduate Student Showcase Award today. He's working on evaluating the molecular interactions between Kerogen (precursor to crude oil) and mineral in the oil shale.
477 2018-02-22 22:51:47 So I’m cooking & spilled the entire bottle of olive oil on me & the floor. Proceeded to try to clean up & slipped & fell down. Hoodie is ruined. Supper is ruined. I’m hurt. What a great day 
478 2018-02-22 22:51:36 So why isn't the EU telling the Turks to get their naval ships out of the area where southern Cyprus is drilling for oil.  Why are they not supporting Cyprus.  What is the point of the EU. They got enough money out of Cyprus a few years back.

487 2018-02-22 22:49:44 the Second Amendment accordingly guarantees the right to carry weapons “typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes,” id., at 625.[...]the same is true for the weapons most commonly used today for self-defense, namely, revolvers and semiautomatic pistols.

499 2018-02-22 22:49:02 Yeah, that's why foreign agents are trying hard to turn the American public against oil.
500 2018-02-22 22:49:02 Oh, so it's fairly small? Small notebook-sized? That's a pretty tight area, for oil paint.
501 2018-02-22 22:48:58 does castor oil really help grow out your eyebrows/eyelashes?
502 2018-02-22 22:48:56 all the credible reports I've seen show oil use not dropping before 2040, but the majors are diversifying into renewable anyway. BP wouldn't mind a huge global CO2 reduction movement, just swap all coal for their natural gas
503 2018-02-22 22:48:49 He starts as a big chunk of grey/metalic ice, with oil themed abilities. As he levels up he thaws to reveal a HR Giger-esque cyborg skeleton ala Terminator with progressively more lasers and creepy tubes ability FX. At max lvl his ult darkens the sky and brings AI apocalypse

Two slices bread (white or scalia), drizzle with garlic flavored olive oil and sprinkle w/seasalt...toast in oven. Then place MB maple-flavored bacon (sale $2.99), tomatoes, cucumbers, mayo...Mmmmmm...Marvelous!
514 2018-02-22 22:46:44 Came to get an oil change.. my service advisor has a serious bulge going on  #icantstopstaring

521 2018-02-22 22:45:33 Excellent question, also would like to know about care car? Do our favorite rappers change the oil for their exotic vehicles? Keep them clean?Some seem very reckless.
522 2018-02-22 22:45:27 No, No, and hell No. Cruz showed his true colors along with Kasich during the primaries. Trump was right about Cruz! A bible in one hand and lies with the other. He hasn't changed. He gives me the creeps. Reminds me of a snake oil salesman.
523 2018-02-22 22:45:25 What kind of oil change takes an hour and a half? 
524 2018-02-22 22:45:25 Build the computer so it's as compact as possible so there is less volume to fill with oil.  This will reduce the possibility of the case bursting open from the weight.  Copper tubing with water can be run through the oil to keep it cool.

526 2018-02-22 22:45:06 If you want a non-traditional non-dairy version, salted peanut oil with a tickener mixin is a great sub for butter.

And ghost chilis with unflitered apple cider vinegar are always a good sub for those weak cayennes in Frank's.
527 2018-02-22 22:45:05 Butter, coconut oil & Stevia. I’m addicted.
528 2018-02-22 22:44:58 Mark with a message from Diary: "do not throw food down the sink, that's what clogged it, not the oil"  ... oil probably didn't help tho
529 2018-02-22 22:44:53 Just used one of @LushLtd hot oil hair treatments and let’s just say it felt like i was doing a spa treatment at home
530 2018-02-22 22:44:49 I think oil have the biggest trade chip in the 2018 first. I suspect you're losing that if you want ek.

I don't know if it's possible, but i would want an extension guarantee from ek too.
531 2018-02-22 22:44:42 I wonder how long the list of subsidies for the oil and gas industry is. I really would like to have official numbers. Aside from official tax dollars if a country builds a road the bitumen isn't free for them. Atop of that the demand in fuel is likely to increase. #freemarket
532 2018-02-22 22:44:29 Erm so if it was deemed important and was required 350 million people couldnt organise to assist each other in removing weapons, thats yet another of those perpetuated myths by pro gun snake oil salesman who said but we can supply you with anything you want.

578 2018-02-22 22:39:15 I was referring the Canadian oil exports into USA getting only about half of what other oils fetch and/or half of world price. American buyers know Alberta oil has no rival markets so the buyers bid price down to cost.

594 2018-02-22 22:36:56 Prelim thoughts: overnight is sitting at 5980. R1 is 973. The DJ30 might be up but the $SPX was pretty anemic... 5980 feels optimistic unless the oil up overnight can assist. But the AUDUSD was up as well. Attitude atm is fade the open up to 995. See if 975 can hold. #ASX200

596 2018-02-22 22:36:54 So doing the same thing to semi-auto guns as was done to fully-auto guns would be unconstitutional due to the majority of guns it would cover. Makes sense. What if the ban has more limits? When is it not unconstitutional, like with fully-auto, and then becomes unconstitutional?

Also depends in NY where you get them. My in-laws live near a reservation so they used to get them there in bulk for cheap. Also a lot of people vape here now so the price of the oil or w/e is moderate
604 2018-02-22 22:35:37 If Venezuela has so much oil then where is the money going? Someone is playing games with people's lives and its not right.    #BBCNewsTen

611 2018-02-22 22:34:44 Datura (nightshade) in small doses is a powerful hallucinogen. Along with visions it is said to create a feeling of floating or flying. Mixed with an oil or salve it can be applied to absorbent membranes. That's why witches "ride" a broomstick.

Its time to start reducing unnecessary demand that we can't supply if we don't build renewables
621 2018-02-22 22:33:02 It's no accident that the Bernie Left believes the UN intervention in Libya was a horrible war of choice done for oil, despite being perfectly able to read the actual documents involved. Russia told them that. On purpose.

630 2018-02-22 22:31:16 The BBC’s story on the Venezuelan Medicine crisis is so disturbing for a country with the largest oil reserves in the world. One can only pray that the world learns of the inherent failures within a socialist regime. A regime Corbyn still fails to condemn...

723 2018-02-22 22:19:58 @cbdbrothers hi gonna buy your green tomorrow but can't decide on paste or oil which is best to start with and what ml for 1 month supply ?

I walked along the golden isles,
I felt the sand and gave a smile,
I thought how lucky I must be,
So please let's keep it oil free!

728 2018-02-22 22:19:42 I’m always grateful for my phone whenever I’m at the car place for an oil change... I can only read magazines for so long but I can play candy crush forever

732 2018-02-22 22:19:05 1杯やりましょうよ
733 2018-02-22 22:19:04 I'm not Paula, but if it works for the French, I'm all for it. Have you seen the per capita cheese, butter, chocolate and olive oil consumption rates for France and compared them to ours? The actual numbers look insane.
734 2018-02-22 22:19:01 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
735 2018-02-22 22:18:45 Play well !!! Insane we build for oil and gas pipelines but why not for water as well if its needed....hope the rain comes after your final putt
736 2018-02-22 22:18:44 100% nut, no palm oil, no added sugar pb as well !!!
737 2018-02-22 22:18:43 We got orange oil in the radiator scent thing at the moment.
738 2018-02-22 22:18:28 Sir. How is that beard oil. I am in the market for something.
739 2018-02-22 22:18:23 Oil rigs + drilling have already made 
impact on fishing stocks. Before the oil business there were sharks 
and tuna  in the North Sea until the atmospheric nuclear tests which reduced the 2 latter and by 1960's were not caught again. Oil and gas bad for fish stocks. TrustEUcrtts
740 2018-02-22 22:18:18 Citation needed
Prophecy needs to be extremely specific for you to make that claim
Not some vague statement that you can misconstrue as having meaning
The authors of the buybull had no idea where the sun went at night but we're supposed to believe the knew of oil fields
741 2018-02-22 22:18:10 Proper fiat 500 tweet but how nice is it covering yourself in coconut oil before bed uhhh

Lol..they should have turrets, and moats, and catapults, and hot oil, tar, and feathers. 
#gomedieval
743 2018-02-22 22:18:05 I just type in argan oil?
744 2018-02-22 22:18:00 i’m going to go three months without getting my brows done and only applying castor oil 

:(
745 2018-02-22 22:17:56 Harvest and replenish. How do you do that with oil?
746 2018-02-22 22:17:45 The assets on the island are owned by the islands government (They've sold some oil exploration rights but retain a right to a portion of said oil income).  The FIC is a private company that works on the island, not the owner of the islands.
747 2018-02-22 22:17:39 Ze needs pull up with the oil for the fried Oreos
748 2018-02-22 22:17:36 هههههههههههههههههه فكر شويه وبص في ورقتك
749 2018-02-22 22:17:25 Showing you don't need the backing of an oil country to be successful
750 2018-02-22 22:16:43 So true. Oil is a vital commodity to the global economy. The real fear should be in the lack of capex in conventional sources. Shale will fire up quickly and depletion rates will be high.
751 2018-02-22 22:16:42 I smell like tea tree oil, coconut oil, shea butter and manuka honey. #IssaSnack
752 2018-02-22 22:16:36 Being in the middle of the pack is not a bad place to be. Tax income is the supplier of services, education health etc. So if we drop the tax do we have to produce more oil which requires a market/pipeline? Would the investment from outside of Canada make up the shortfall?

755 2018-02-22 22:16:05 I need coconut oil in my life.
756 2018-02-22 22:16:03 That's the problem Try boiling or sautéing in a bit of broth or water. Or salute onions then garlic no oil then add a tiny bit of water or broth with the spinach
757 2018-02-22 22:16:02 Ehyah! Sorry case this is where you stand since 2003 pls stay tune!
758 2018-02-22 22:15:51 Oil ur own machine

760 2018-02-22 22:15:41 So lots of people are bashing her that she got an oil bloc for free. I'm just here wondering the kind of network she must have had to have received such a "gift"
761 2018-02-22 22:15:30 Yes, oil going up is the big investment theme for me for coming 2-3 yrs. Gear Energy and California Resources Corp are biggest pos
762 2018-02-22 22:15:21 So the coco oil weighs it down a bit and makes it looks way better imo
763 2018-02-22 22:15:17 As part of my health kick I tried to make a healthy dinner; failing that I’m sure I’ve put enough chilli oil in it to burn through me. #ShrinkingShiv
764 2018-02-22 22:15:15 @MadMoneyOnCNBC @madcan anyone explain the price movement of Apache Oil today. It dropped almost 10 percent when the market is up ; oil price is up; its earning and revenue both beat expectation; and its outlook forecast is pretty good.
765 2018-02-22 22:14:49 shut up.. Bad guy
766 2018-02-22 22:14:43 Is idiocracy your only language? 
Looks like it to me. People like you are the kind to blame for why the planet is like it is. Well that time is over. Time to wake up smell the coffee(facts) and step into the future.
Oil, Coal, pollution aren't apart of the future Earth NEEDS
767 2018-02-22 22:14:27 Infowars needs to come out with the best CBD oil in the market and sell it!
An entire Hemp line would be perfect

769 2018-02-22 22:13:54 you became billionaire through fraud, allocation of oil well to a fashion designer under the leadership of maradon
770 2018-02-22 22:13:53 @TheSimpsons Bush 1 throws out some shade. Cruz tries to adopt the family to his cause. Full circle? #StupidPeople 

GOP is the party of Bob, Burns, Texas oil tycoons, and vampires.
771 2018-02-22 22:13:50 zionazis are anti-human racist supremacists. it's the truth. it's a matter of choosing right or wrong, good or evil, truth is not a political view. LEFT/dems & RIGHT/reps serve bankers corps & israel. they are destroying our rights & funding big oil, wars, genocide & terrorism.
772 2018-02-22 22:13:49 Thats what Alberta Premier Lougheed did,  SHUT OFF the tap with the oil flowing east after Pierre Trudeau caused all the trouble for Alberta. We can do same with it flowing West, and that may happen yet.
773 2018-02-22 22:13:48 It's common knowledge that the SNP were desperate to try and save jobs in the O&G industry. I'd also mention that the profit and tax situation for the oil companies in other countries is irrelevant. Oil and gas production costs offshore UK are relatively very high.
774 2018-02-22 22:13:42 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
775 2018-02-22 22:13:42 Need an oil change.
776 2018-02-22 22:13:27 im just slicker than niggas like olive oil 
777 2018-02-22 22:12:48 Because “God” is actually the oil, gas and coal industry.
778 2018-02-22 22:12:44 So you’re saying rail isn’t free market because of regulations that have been contemplated for the oil industry?
779 2018-02-22 22:12:34 He has gotten the automatic ticket and if you like, kill yourself
780 2018-02-22 22:12:28 Not really. There's over 5 million AR-15s in America. Guess how many of them have been used in mass shootings. As for NRA, there's plenty of favourable laws Dems pass for their benefactors. Simple solution: Elect those who'll further your agenda.
781 2018-02-22 22:12:25 You spoiled me then 
782 2018-02-22 22:11:56 The last federal assault weapon ban didn't ban every semi-automatic gun. It was a pretty exhaustive list of guns on a select list of criteria.
783 2018-02-22 22:11:36 Who is belittling school children @TheJuanWilliams? Big oil, the wind industry, teachers' unions, labor unions, lawyers and dozens of other special interest groups influence politicians. But the NRA is the bad guy. Really. #TheFive
784 2018-02-22 22:11:30 Oil change went well! Got tires rotated! And had them fix a recall notice! So far, so good!
785 2018-02-22 22:11:27 Dow up 164points  .66% but not looking confident atm..
Gold up .5% to $1331 last time I looked respecting asymmetrical trend forming over the last 2 months..

791 2018-02-22 22:10:33 No. I am saying its not needed because the risk of having it far outweighs the benefits. And taking NRA money and passing favourable laws (or blocking unfavourable ones) isn't exactly democratic process. But to each his own
792 2018-02-22 22:10:22 あ！何かガスマスクつけた白い鳥がいるぞ！待てー！
793 2018-02-22 22:10:09 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
794 2018-02-22 22:10:04 Yes--have the better part of a pound of butter, a fresh bottle of olive oil, and plenty of cheese. I think we are covered. :)
795 2018-02-22 22:09:57 Wonderful just left the dealership,  no tires yet and no new brakes for rear until next service.   How did the oil change go?  Thanks for asking,  you never no if the hybrid battery is going out.  So a 2007 with over 150,000 it is a great day!
796 2018-02-22 22:09:43 Semi-automatic guns aren't designed for mass shootings either.
797 2018-02-22 22:09:36 Ah great I just wanted to know as there are oil patches on the offside which are only accessible by canoe or rowboat and whether you planned on using yours to access those areas during clean ups. Happy also to check with continuous cruisers in area
798 2018-02-22 22:09:29 god bless oil blotting sheets forever and ever amen
799 2018-02-22 22:09:25 See the Support Dog on the plane licking a man's bald head in the

800 2018-02-22 22:09:20 zero, none. @bobzimmermp doesn't approve of anything unless it kills something. He promotes the AR 15, environmental death through 1000 gas and oil wells, mines and such. Meanwhile, our only bridge is falling apart, roads are awful but he never mentions that!! #PoorRepresentation

802 2018-02-22 22:08:55 Changing oil and shit
803 2018-02-22 22:08:41 Sure, but nor is you saying ban this because I don't think it's needed. I'd rather put my faith in  a democratic process.
804 2018-02-22 22:08:34 I don't what Ndebeles are doing with Shona people, history has taught us we can't leave with these people. Its like mixing water and oil.
805 2018-02-22 22:08:23 It is 3” x 4” and it’s oil on canvas

808 2018-02-22 22:08:05 ....and that is why I don't listen to CHILDREN when it comes to moral questions facing our society.
809 2018-02-22 22:07:53 Now when certain countries disrespecting our oil down with the soup they making I can see getting upset about that....cause When I was there they even told me in my face that we doh know how to make it and theirs better....now this disrespect I won’t tolerate
810 2018-02-22 22:07:49 Cars have been used to do it multiple times.

812 2018-02-22 22:07:40 Any excuse for the Communists to start with the No Guns routine. Over in Europe only the criminals have guns. Some of the policemen in England aren't allowed guns! The people are now helpless, their politicians are all for Globalisation.
813 2018-02-22 22:07:31 I thought Obama was a decent president , not great, but not horrible. But with Trump...I just don’t get the appeal.  Ultimately he’s a snake oil salesman.  Or for NY...he’s playing 3 card Monty and we are all his marks.
814 2018-02-22 22:07:17 Spring is gearing up! Time to get those bikes serviced out and cleaned up! Call Jourdan today to schedule an appointment for your oil and tire changes! Also see Patrick or the ladies up front for spray polish! We have everything you need to get back to riding!

821 2018-02-22 22:06:21 2 stroke is alot easier than nitro fuel, it's basically a 30cc chainsaw engine,. Just need to get your oil mix right and its pull and go.
822 2018-02-22 22:06:16 Oil money, i got tanks of gas like Texaco
823 2018-02-22 22:06:15 Well, don't forget that Canada exports its oil via US Gulf Coast as well, and their production is rising as well.

825 2018-02-22 22:05:47 I'm going to guess there's some well funded video game lobbyists in DC. They may have some quid pro quos with the media for positive media spin. I love when teens say 'despicable'.
826 2018-02-22 22:05:38 Carl Icahn worked to change the Environmental Protection Agency's "renewable fuel standard" that required oil refiners to blend corn-based ethanol into gasoline. Changing the rule would save one of Icahn's companies, CVR Energy, hundreds of millions of dollars.
827 2018-02-22 22:05:36 ايوه كده 
828 2018-02-22 22:05:31 You claim to give so much care toward these things but you literally couldn’t give a shit about the lives and deaths of children. If you cared at all, you’d have the conversation to see WHAT you COULD do.
829 2018-02-22 22:05:23 i mean what kind of oil was in it? I assumed like avocado or olive or coconut.
830 2018-02-22 22:05:15 And Idk if every non-essential dangerous item should be banned. But yeah when one comes up that is used to kill dozens of civilians at one time, we can talk about them as well. For now, we can stick to banning assault weapons.

833 2018-02-22 22:05:00 Only a day or so after his confirmation as EPA chief,  an Oklahoma FOIA came thru on possible collusion with Oil and Gas companies. The timing was suspicious.  Reporters might want look those documents again.
834 2018-02-22 22:04:51 If it weren't for the ACLU & the okay from the Supreme Court, these guys would be locked up in the Insane Asylums. This wasn't happening when we had a place to lock the crazies away forever!
835 2018-02-22 22:04:48 The people who try to throw people in the lunatic asylum so they can make money out of their relatives who give orders about legacies, insurance have proposed a "residential home" of flats on the oil waste tip Scot Wilson Kilpratrick expertly cleared off Portishead Wyndham Way
836 2018-02-22 22:04:40 Cars have been used in mass killings. So have handguns. And the legislature already decided against your view. Get enough people to elect folks who agree with you, and you'll have the change you wish to see.
837 2018-02-22 22:04:29 @guarnaschelli I have a bottle of extra virgin olive oil infused with blood orange. Any suggestions on how to use it?
838 2018-02-22 22:04:24 At what fucking point does it become a bad thing to protect children BEFORE they’re killed? How are kids the bad guy for not wanting to die? For seeing how easy it is for someone to do this? How are you so blind that you can’t?
839 2018-02-22 22:04:07 Hate coming to get my oil changed because the guys always laugh at me because I’m dumb and don’t know what kind of oil I need. 
840 2018-02-22 22:04:04 My skin is stupid sensitive and tea tree oil directly is too harsh even when I water it down. Like I can use products with tea tree but for some reason using it directly burns.  But I use Sunday Riley and that shit saved my life.
841 2018-02-22 22:03:46 i've spilt oil from the dough balls we ordered for dinner all over my duvet and i can't get rid of the stain or the smell, why am i an idiot
842 2018-02-22 22:03:18 Not true! The reason it was allowed to expire was because there was no significant change in crimes committed with those guns.
843 2018-02-22 22:03:14 Took my jeep for her first routine maintenance appointment and found out my first 4 oil changes are free  what a great surprise
844 2018-02-22 22:03:13 Nobody is blaming law abiding citizens you ignorant fucks. People are blaming the lack of gun control. The lack of security around deadly weapons. The amount of random people who want to use guns with malicious intent.

846 2018-02-22 22:03:02 The only difference is Iran has oil to back it's crypto currency. Venezuelan regime broke the oil Industry. It's in Russian & Chinese hands.

848 2018-02-22 22:03:00 I know this oil is supposed to smell sweet, but there's a fine line between sweet and cloying.  *tosses out another mix*
849 2018-02-22 22:02:56 Not sure we can.
But on a second thought, Brexit should teach Nigerians that the single most important thing we have is the size of our market (consumers & labour) not oil or mineral resources.
We need to find a way to turn this country into an Asian Tiger.
850 2018-02-22 22:02:54 I imagine vampires listen to a lot less vicious than olive oil.
851 2018-02-22 22:02:47 I agree with this, but it kills motivation to do anything for most. Also it has been so manipulated. I think the oil heals and gives no affects that thc does.

855 2018-02-22 22:02:35 That gift should be investigated sef! 

You don’t just gift someone an oil block!
856 2018-02-22 22:02:29 The legislature does. As it has in the past. Civilians should not be owning weapons that can be and has been used in mass killings. Thats not really a hard point to get!
857 2018-02-22 22:02:09 iPath S&P GSCI Crude Oil Total Return Index ETN (OIL) price at close, 2018-02-22, is 6.95.

860 2018-02-22 22:01:48 I mean you can be given an oil bloc and still make a mess of it. Several examples abound. The late Arisekola Alao even without a University degree owned almost half of First Bank before his death. Several lettered men drank from his pool of wisdom daily.
861 2018-02-22 22:01:33 Sauté cloves of garlic in olive oil. Drain & rinse no salt cannellini beans. Add to garlic. Add white wine and no salt broth, bring to boil. Add bag of baby spinach. Cover and let wilt. Fold together and give it to me. Thank you.
862 2018-02-22 22:01:33 Right! Questions that no one asks! Mind you I saw a picture and guess who was there as they struck the oil? It wasn't a person of color that's for sure
863 2018-02-22 22:01:13 And the oil and coal guys are choking on their arrogance and greed.
864 2018-02-22 22:01:06 They are Making noise as if they are solely funding the project. Oil companies are the major financier.
865 2018-02-22 22:01:04 The USA doesn't have the geology or reserves to become a long term “massive oil exporter”.
866 2018-02-22 22:01:02 find out where you stay and act like we found some oil.
867 2018-02-22 22:00:57 items in grocery such as olive oil or beer or even any bulk section at all, so even if not expensive, it would still be inaccessible. I think this raises an important point in need of addressing: we gotta change how we talk about accessibility.  We can't label a (cont)
868 2018-02-22 22:00:55 If you can get your hands on it, use rosehip oil. I've had horrible acne scarring from really bad cystic acne but it takes away the bumpy red terribleness of it. It won't completely go away but it refixes the skin and it'll help make it smooth!

870 2018-02-22 22:00:40 Getting an oil change is for the straights what am I doing here
871 2018-02-22 22:00:38 I just found this document in my computer that I did 2 years ago when I first got into skincare and: "Coconut oil: Massage your face with coconut oil before going to bed and rinse off next morning with lukewarm water." - I GASPED OUT LOUD THANK GOD I NEVER DID THAT

875 2018-02-22 22:00:16 February 22, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
876 2018-02-22 22:00:08 Well actually that's a supply graph but yes there are projections of global demand for oil that do show there will be little if any decline in demand too - because of continued population growth plus the need to raise living standards in populous Third World nations
877 2018-02-22 21:59:57 That's amazing. A woman had all her blood taken out of her body, the doctors did the needful and then put it all the blood back in again.

Sort of like changing the oil on a car, but times a gazillion @helenczerski

879 2018-02-22 21:59:44 Spilled scalding hot fry oil on my wrist. Completely melted the skin where it dripped, around 2 inches in diameter. Raw, exposed flesh. Took weeks to fully heal.
880 2018-02-22 21:59:44 Defeted, and running low on oil, germany lanched operation barbarossa inorder to capture Russia's oil fields. Using blitzkrieg, they killed thousands of russians, burning any surplus crops, in order to break the Russians.
881 2018-02-22 21:59:43 Really nothing bad. Kid I played football with had a vat of hot oil fall on him at his first job though. Dodgey leg on equipment at Hungry Jacks (Burger King). I believe he got PAID!
882 2018-02-22 21:59:43 And who exactly decides that? Also, should every non-essential item that can be dangerous be banned?

884 2018-02-22 21:59:32 By "National Program", you mean the @realDonaldTrump plan to open-up nearly the entire U.S. outer continental shelf to oil drilling

Been a week since I last turned it on, it just shorted out, went up in flames, and instead of my room smelling like lavender now it smells like burnt out fireworks. Is this a common issue or am I just lucky

936 2018-02-22 21:51:58 Why was erdogan buying oil from them and treating their injured in YOUR hospitals? He calls YOUR citizens who think/write/teach/ protest terrorists to lock them up and silence his opposition.
937 2018-02-22 21:51:57 Labour don't think they are up to negotiating trade deals for the UK so want the EU to do it for them. Hardly surprising. The last one I remember them doing was Ken Livingstone's deal with Venezuela to trade oil for advice on tackling global warming, e.g. promoting diesel cars.

944 2018-02-22 21:51:14 Michael, the market believes that there is a lot of oil in the world & that it is fairly cheap. The IEA & EIA predict surging shale production. If tight oil companies claim that they can break even at $40, why should the market pay a premium? That's what I mean by re-pricing.

997 2018-02-22 21:44:01 Protect from what?There was an assault weapon ban for 10years and it didnt stop anyone from protecting themselves from imaginary govt tyranny. Oh and the num of mass shootings during those ten years fell significantly and  increased dramatically in the next 10yrs.Pure coincidence
998 2018-02-22 21:43:51 Except in this case it's a gasoline/oil/electrical fire. Everyone tells the firefighters to spray the house down with water, but that won't help. Will probably make the fire worse. The underlying cause of the fire needs to be addressed, or all the water in the world won't help.

1007 2018-02-22 21:42:06 @ShopprsDrugMart and @LoblawsON allow #homeopathic trash to get sold in their store while pulling a gun mag.

Really, guys, be consistent. If you want to get rid of head-in-the-sand product that causes suffering, you should ditch the snake oil too.

1011 2018-02-22 21:41:55 White Christianity is different from other religions in that they don’t really follow Jesus. They pay him lip service while following false prophets and snake oil salesmen. They believe in a war on Christmas, feel like though they are the majority that they’re somehow oppressed.

1018 2018-02-22 21:41:10 The ude aku is one of the best. That's what we've been using for my niece since she was born interchangeably with coconut oil and she's almost four.
1019 2018-02-22 21:40:58 can y’all stop drowning y’all face with coconut oil , y’all look sweaty af

1022 2018-02-22 21:40:41 I'm super duper sensitive so when I was told a long time ago coconut oil was "bad" for lube I just accepted it. I'm happy to hear it works for you - that's encouraging me more to try it!

...Alright I clearly need to do some googling, I didn't realize it was so useful!

1028 2018-02-22 21:40:03 The energy east, was a colossal loss for the Maritime provinces. It falls squarely in the Federal and Provincial @liberal_party We need to stop using foreign oil, and continue to invest in our selves, and our future.
1029 2018-02-22 21:39:57 Interesting stance when oil is at its lowest level in 5 months. But no drop in pump prices.
1030 2018-02-22 21:39:54 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
1031 2018-02-22 21:39:49 Oil slick hubs 
1032 2018-02-22 21:39:31 Oh I agree.  This isn’t about politics lol.  I was just pointing out that they have banked all on the oil and their oil sort of sucks.  Not wise.
1033 2018-02-22 21:39:29 Look up some essential oil you can rub on your baby’s chest!!!
1034 2018-02-22 21:39:21 I agree, I have been trying to do that.  Minimal processing.

I deep fried rutabaga chips in coconut oil yesterday.  They were actually pretty good, and low in carbs
1035 2018-02-22 21:39:11 yeah beef tallow, suet, coconut oil, apparently all good for deep frying. Or pig fat. For high temps I'd try for most stable fat possible just out of paranoia. lol.
1036 2018-02-22 21:39:04 Bigger shortage of representatives representing constituents instead of special interest/terrorist groups like @NRA, big oil, big pharm and also protecting Russia and Russian agents. Need to clean treasonous Congress up, then real Americans can tackle real issues.
1037 2018-02-22 21:38:45 but with lower IQs and more tanning oil.
1038 2018-02-22 21:38:42 What a "threat"! Would only make it easier to reimpose the sanctions and with lower oil price and growing uprising in #Iran will be more crippling than before
1039 2018-02-22 21:38:40 Can't wait for the insanely beautiful @AshleyEmmax to hit my screen tonight . Hopefully with some oil too 
1040 2018-02-22 21:38:21 I think he's trying to get a public opinion. It's a proposal, and will fail in congress because they are inept. 
Other than that, I think he's trying to appease the left, who wants more flame in the oil spill from the liberal media?
1041 2018-02-22 21:38:14 Today would be a good day for the @CapTimes to announce it has divested itself from big oil, gun, chem and pharma.
1042 2018-02-22 21:37:44 Just don't get caught in some snake oil crap.
1043 2018-02-22 21:37:43 Quite an unusual thing in oil and gas!
1044 2018-02-22 21:37:41 How is your beard supposed to flourish without pussy oil, man?
1045 2018-02-22 21:37:34 Adulting is when you have to use your college refund check to get groceries, a new tire, and your oil changed instead of going shopping.
1046 2018-02-22 21:37:32 Im a little more #high than i should be at school. Its a good high though, i smoked the saphire oil. I think i get too high before my classes bc im in fear of the pain of sitting through classes with my back, i wanna avoid that
1047 2018-02-22 21:37:31 yes no Oil paintings any of them
1048 2018-02-22 21:37:13 Thanks.  HIGH-oleic safflower oil interests me because it is great to deep fry in,)but highly processed) I suppose I could look for beef tallow as well
1049 2018-02-22 21:37:07 Are you feeling ok? Yes, it is warm - and that is why the people want a govt that acknowledges climate-science, not a govt that exists to shill for Big Oil. #SiteC #LNG #KInderMorgan #cdnpoli
1050 2018-02-22 21:37:07 You people are just hearing about her free oil bloc ? Idg the new outrage
1051 2018-02-22 21:37:05 Owowow- some oil splashed onto my hand q x q
1052 2018-02-22 21:36:51 I get dry skin on my face and the only thing that helps is before bed I apply some coconut oil to the area and the next day it’s back to normal! Worth a shot for her :)
1053 2018-02-22 21:36:50 But my general rule is if I need an entire chemical factory to extract the oil, it's probably not a great idea to eat it. You can cold press safflower oil iirc but idk how common it is. I just err on the side of limiting excess n6 (oils) and go for minimally processed fats

1060 2018-02-22 21:36:05 I replace the oil with coconut oil, add a sm can crushed , reserve juice, and add pecans. I make a glaze with the  juice and call it tropical paradise  . It's so yummy

1064 2018-02-22 21:35:37 Lurpak spreadable  which I love, Is made from Lurpak butter and rape seed oil
1065 2018-02-22 21:35:37 Also it was found the residents weren’t dispensing of their oil properly so they threw it out of the window down onto the building. And oil is flammable as you may or may not know. You reall  do need to read some more.
1066 2018-02-22 21:35:36 spent so much i got a free oil change 
1067 2018-02-22 21:35:25 I do bitch i just got an oil change and new brakes allat, this shit probably was fucked up when they sold it to me

1072 2018-02-22 21:35:06 Well, careful there. GWB qualifies as a war criminal & traitor who knowingly got us into an oil/revenge war that killed 100s of thousands, is costing trillions, & has completely destabilized the Middle East, killing yet more & making us less safe. 43's body count wins so far.

1076 2018-02-22 21:34:44 So tea tree oil just slipped in to my eye, so I’m currently tweeting with one eye, dear future husband, I have nice skin please don’t decrease my bride price.
1077 2018-02-22 21:34:43 it doesn’t work for anyone. especially if you already have oily skin. its just regular coconut oil.
1078 2018-02-22 21:34:37 And the courts and Lucas oil and bankers life and the airport,, but nothing at schools, and teenagers at the movie theaters
1079 2018-02-22 21:34:35 Depends.  If they shun the exchange, yes.  It would better serve CN to promote PVG-X as a viable exchange, not a price demand platform.  Others can threaten to move, but if oil doesn't flow, that is instant pain.

1082 2018-02-22 21:34:11 Totally!  The orphaned wells have nothing to do with the wells not being productive anymore. Those wells would be definitely be pumping away their 0.25 bbl/d if only there was somewhere to put all of that oil!
1083 2018-02-22 21:34:11 Yeah, I see it as a bunch of rich banker types(and big oil, big pharma as well) trying to convince people that everything is ok, and they aren't actually exploiting people at all, and if they are, it's basically good for us. Jordan is kissing up to power, as usual.
1084 2018-02-22 21:34:07 This is ridicilious. PYD has a relationship between Usa and they are killig innocent people. They are saying that they are fighting with isis which is not true. Only they are sharing oil and phoresperity.

1086 2018-02-22 21:34:06 Well I wonder why public Schools are failing now...Surely it has nothing to do with funding being cut every month while we continue to subsidize oil/gas and other corporations and bailouts.
1087 2018-02-22 21:34:06 Coconut oil dries tf out of my scalp so idk who told you that. I don’t really use it unless it’s for my face in combination with other moisturizers.

1100 2018-02-22 21:32:22 It's hemp seed oil. Very weak & people are being mislead thinking it's the same thing as cannabis oil needed for epilepsy, cancer etc ... it's not.
1101 2018-02-22 21:31:53 Canola is poison disguised. I admit it tastes good, but that doesn't mean it's good for us. Canola oil is added to Olive Oil, mostly undisclosed. Waitresses don't realize this. Be sure to ask. Twice.

No they apparently discovered oil onshore
1130 2018-02-22 21:27:44 Bloomberg, you are making a major mistake here. Petro is not oil-backed, there is no place where you can get it exchanged for oil, guaranteed. All "investors" get is Maduro's word that it's value is backed by Venezuelan oil.
1131 2018-02-22 21:27:36 Absolutely Agree-whole heartedly-Will they do it? No... why? Because the Gun, Insurance, Oil & Pharm & Bank Deregulation lobbyists pay for the GOP to ensure the sensible laws won’t affect their “ Bottom Line”

Witness the mandated consumption of corn ethanol which comprises 10% of our fuel even though we now export oil.

1170 2018-02-22 21:22:24 My nose and area on both sides of my nose is oil city.  The combo of the two primer controls the oil better than anything else I've tried so far. Depending on weather and activity, I can get a good 2 to 3 hours, sometimes more if I'm having a good day.

Given that I've stayed civil while being laughed at and called names, I've got no problem with doing that. No point getting angry over a Twitter debate.
1179 2018-02-22 21:20:49 Stopped and got some eucalyptus to add to my tangerine oil and oh my my head feels so much better 
1180 2018-02-22 21:20:47 Venezuelan oil is low grade, and needs heavy refining.  That’s why it’s not Uber rich like Saudi Arabia.

He's not sharp left that I have seen.
Maybe his middle ground can make progress for all.

1220 2018-02-22 21:15:54 Ok, different example: Currently, fully-automatic weapons are fully banned/illegal. We limit the freedom of all to own a fully-automatic weapons because of the immense damage and cost to human flourishing. Does that take away constitutional rights?
1221 2018-02-22 21:15:49 As a ciswoman with PCOS I have become an expert on this also. May I humbly suggest using a good oil rather than a shaving cream. My favourite being OGX argan oil. Technically for hair but works wonders on my skin.

1227 2018-02-22 21:14:53 Reading the Petro whitepaper.. They plan to launch it on a few reputable global crypto exchanges. It says nothing about how the Petro's backed oil reserves can be proven. You have to believe it.

1229 2018-02-22 21:14:22 I went to standing rock. You do realize Kennedy’s money is tied up in both the tobacco and oil industries
1230 2018-02-22 21:14:19 And yes, given that the oil and gas sector is only 7% of GDP I don't think any potential uplift should be relied upon (which is why the 2014 White Paper was pants). 

I do however think that UKGov has seriously mismanaged the sector. Whatever your views on indy, this shd change.
1231 2018-02-22 21:14:13 whoever recommends putting coconut oil on ur face is a liar and they want to see u breakout so they can look better than you
1232 2018-02-22 21:13:59 No. Just no. What you don't understand, or want to understand, is that the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of Americans don't want the snake oil the NRA is selling. Also, we want our country back. We want to stop the Russian-funded NRA from killing our kids for profit.

1264 2018-02-22 21:10:30 think i would characterize Norway more as a rare oil oversaver than a manipulator, but no doubt Norway's oil policy has lowered its RER too

1271 2018-02-22 21:09:57 Well, isn't the need for liquid fuel rising? If they are trained in refining crude oil, then it should be fairly easy to retrain for ethanol or liquid hydrogen.

1274 2018-02-22 21:09:40 Jeez. Aren't many oil companies simultaneously arguing that drones can help them monitor and prevent leaks? They love to talk out of both sides of their mouths.

1276 2018-02-22 21:09:22 So it that why Erdogan supports HTS in Syria, which is a terrorist organisation and bought oil from Isis at cheap prices?
1277 2018-02-22 21:09:16 I need to work at this! Trying to be healthy and thought I'd try Tom Kerridge's low fat Tuna Nicoise Salad...until the lady on the fish counter told me how much a tuna steak cost! Plus extra virgin olive oil,,greek yoghurt..fresh basil...um nope! Cheaper option needed!
1278 2018-02-22 21:09:14 She seems nice, but my heart belongs to Marion Le Pen.
1279 2018-02-22 21:09:05 I do believe the economy was in ruin at the time from Republicans destroying it. Obama had his hands full with trying to keep families from living in the streets. I remember it well. Then the BP oil spill happened to make things worse. The economy was devastated.

1284 2018-02-22 21:08:15 I got Oil of Olay in my eye earlier, so I’m using that as a cover
1285 2018-02-22 21:08:05 Thanks I've seen that report. It is good. The WSJ figures I showed you post-date that analysis and include the other elements of the costs incurred. Next update from GERS will be telling but you can't bake any oil revenue uplift given price volatility, agreed?
1286 2018-02-22 21:07:56 @cathmckenna your carbon tax can fix this right ? Or is raw sewage exempt from pollution ? Just oil from Alberta ?
1287 2018-02-22 21:07:50 OMG I HAD THAT! i really liked it too but i wasnt patient enough to let it dry bc it took forever ifjdjfjf i might have to so something like that again or just get a serum AND oil my face up and thank u so much omfg ill do that after class today

1301 2018-02-22 21:06:08 i rly love the mizon snail gel! and i use an oil to go on after it n it keeps my skin texture smoother. i dont rly use creams bc i have oily dehydrated skin. also i tell everyone ths but if ur looking for skincare recs look at the skincareaddiction and asianbeauty subreddits

1303 2018-02-22 21:05:49 i have a whole fucking army on my left cheek and it makes me so mad bc my skin is clear everywhere else and ive truly been eating so well lately so i guess i have to change up my skincare routine again :/ ill invest in those things too!! and rosehip oil is amazing for scars

1312 2018-02-22 21:04:42 Try this from the 50's:
In you salad bowl, put
Small clove raw garlic, minced or pressed
1/8 tsp dry mustard
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
1/2  tsp salt
Grind it together with the back of a spoon
Add 1 Tbs vinegar
1/4 Cup oil
Stir. Top with greens, cukes, radishes, scallions. Toss.
1313 2018-02-22 21:04:34 If you put a rainbow on the sign, maybe your snake oil will sell better.
1314 2018-02-22 21:04:14 Try beard oil form sorbet you can get it kwa clicks or woolies one. Also coconut oil does help.

1318 2018-02-22 21:03:47 i have one rn bc ive been slacking w skincare lately  i hate those. i heard rosehip oil is rly good tho.. maybe try using hyaluronic acid n then putting on a serum if u dont already.. i gotta start doing that again i never got them when i did that
1319 2018-02-22 21:03:35 Not much that’s why should be banned both. Why anyone need those?

1397 2018-02-22 20:54:17 Natural market forces maintain efficiency. Why do you think car manufacturers make such a big thing out of MPG? Because as oil becomes scarcer and more  expensive, people will seek efficiency. Don't need Juncker and his mob to get involved with  something that works already.

1399 2018-02-22 20:53:53 Not necessarily--just that it should be fish/krill not flax or chia, and not be oxidized. Carlson's has a good reputation and so does Nutrigold triple strength fish oil. I'm not endorsing any particular one. Best to get as much of your omega-3 as possible from real food.

1406 2018-02-22 20:53:32 @LinusTech in your recent video about the mineral oil PC parts working, after the short, does the GPU still work or is the red lines caused from a bad gpu as well?
1407 2018-02-22 20:53:30 Skin care: coconut oil w/ drop of daily moisturizer
1408 2018-02-22 20:53:27 Alas, the tragedy of the rapeseed. Poorly named, forever maligned. Could the tragedy have something to do with #Can #womenshockey loss last night? Will the #Curling loss against the US tonight be the end for #canola (Canada Oil eh).
1409 2018-02-22 20:53:23 Don't understand why they didn't just have Gabe go out there in a cut-off shirt that said LIFT or COCONUT OIL or SMEAR
1410 2018-02-22 20:53:18 Lol ah  nna re lapile Thato, waiting for the oil to heat up takes too long
1411 2018-02-22 20:52:58 But we can’t do that, and an actual Muslim ban would be unconstitutional because of the 1st Amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing the right to freedom of religion. Correct?

1413 2018-02-22 20:52:38 A lesser spotted GE Oil and Gas Arena mention! Superb work mab @Rod_Studd @Wayne501Mardle @hjvilla95
1414 2018-02-22 20:52:36 Needs doing. The most dangerous bit is lifting a pan with 30ltrs of red hot oil in it.
1415 2018-02-22 20:52:34 This is puzzling. First, the government will have used to spend the money raised, say to pay for Saudi oil. Surely the Fed will then have wired that money to the sellers of the oil. Also, even if all that money just sits there, interest would be added?
1416 2018-02-22 20:52:21 Before oil money came proper football
1417 2018-02-22 20:52:19 The left wing groups have helped substantially by completely paralyzing the Canadian Oil and Gas industry. Not a single new oil or gas export pipeline has been constructed in Canada in a very, very long time.

1421 2018-02-22 20:52:06 Of course. They’re just a computer. Easily hacked. It’s already been done LOL so pack your speedo and suntan oil...
1422 2018-02-22 20:52:05 True! Before oil, that was what we were running on and we did just fine!

1431 2018-02-22 20:51:36 I normally give mine a good exfoliating scrub and then pile on face oil - rub it in hands to make it warm - or coconut oil
1432 2018-02-22 20:51:34 i got robbed by an oil company in Indianapolis hows your day going
1433 2018-02-22 20:51:28 Well, the LOOP (Louisiana Offshore Oil Port) can, but that's about it for now. They had their maiden export in 40 years just a few days ago.
1434 2018-02-22 20:51:26 It's been a long day already. Went out to get my car's oil changed, had the brake pads replaced, bought new shoes, and went on a quest to find a new GC controller with no luck.

May or may not be at the weekly today. Running on 4 hours of sleep.
1435 2018-02-22 20:51:23 Confidence play is $SAEX due to oil bring up think we get a gap over 2.00 and run in the morning.
1436 2018-02-22 20:51:21 I woke up this morning to tj trying to tell me all about this essential oil class he signed me up for and I thought it was all a dream
1437 2018-02-22 20:51:09 I'm sleepy. I'm smiling. I'm ready to shave my sack and drench it in oil after I shower. Sensitivity Stimulation Therapy. SinnerSaint needs a woman who wants his oils on his sack.

1442 2018-02-22 20:50:10 So you’re saying law abiding gun owners shouldn’t be lumped in with psychotic killers, I agree.  Thanks!
1443 2018-02-22 20:50:06 As for Liberia, the main focus since the war has been in rubber as an extractive (which is a problem) and rice (which cannot compete with imported rice). Palm oil has received little attention as a result, as have rubber value addition, cocoa, fish and horticulture.
1444 2018-02-22 20:50:01 Keep up the good motivational work and maybe you can become official purchaser of coconut oil for the team.

He knows I love him, we do all equally, and I make the best meals, join on all trips, fish with him and laugh at his jokes, even tho I’ve heard all

1448 2018-02-22 20:49:29 Violent video games, violent movies and rap music are catalysts to loss of control of aggression.  Lack of proper parenting and the breakdown of the nuclear family are a powder keg and we see the explosions now.

1456 2018-02-22 20:48:57 They're planning to reduce expenses by gutting every program that helps the poor, seniors, children, disabled, the environment, and selling our National Parks, water rights, etc. to oil, gas and other private companies. So billionaires can save money

1471 2018-02-22 20:46:07 You say that like you give a crap about workers. If you did, we'd get more than $1.50 a week from your #Goptaxscam. Or, you could stop grabbing your ankles for the oil/coal industry and train those workers to build renewable power equipment. #LyinRyan

1478 2018-02-22 20:45:32 It wont be easy to phase out big oil but it will happen. Millenials are ready to take on the challenge of change and like he said, save humanity. The leapfrogging of change is what really excites me for the 3rd world.
1479 2018-02-22 20:45:14 I’ve never gotten to stay in my car for an oil change. IT IS V STRANGE.

1481 2018-02-22 20:45:10 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1482 2018-02-22 20:45:05 At least you weren't attaching jobs to this environmentally destructive economical farce you keep trying to sell. Cause the only people that benefit from this idea, is oil company owners and our federal government who gives our money to oil company owners.
1483 2018-02-22 20:45:03 Now Cunningham talking about 15 more minutes for an oil change like look

1505 2018-02-22 20:40:59 They want teachers to quit, parents to pull their kids out & homeschool. They want to kill public schools & only have religious indoctrinating charter schools where they can teach your kids about God, Earth being flat, oil & gas, & rising oceans are God's plan. No gays allowed.
1506 2018-02-22 20:40:50 Hate going through the phase of looking UGLY.

If I'm still ugly after this I s2g
1507 2018-02-22 20:40:36   Seat heaters is a nice idea but probably too late at this point. 
I did just acquire an oil pressure gauge that matches the Temp & Fuel, so it looks like I will be making some changes to the dashboard as well. It's already off 
1508 2018-02-22 20:40:35 Phil has been around LONG ENOUGH to know that it is NOT inventories ... but the PRICE which is SOMETIMES a fair predictor of the future economy ... and oil is at RELATIVELY LOW price compared to the past DECADE ... so that's a BEARISH outlook for the future economy ...
1509 2018-02-22 20:40:34 If not for the oil well you could have been in one of the tailoring shops. And besides what have you done for the people in the area the oil well is located.

1520 2018-02-22 20:39:35 The only background US needs to know is if the country it is invading has a shitton of oil

1526 2018-02-22 20:38:35 It is the lack of motive power to haul cars,,,,,also more crews would be needed.....moving oil is more profitable than moving grain....guess who owns the tank cars......WARREN BUFFET.

1533 2018-02-22 20:38:02 Arabs like Saudis and UAE threw Palestinians under the bus a long time ago. They don't want to upset the people they are more selling oil and buying weapons from the west.

1535 2018-02-22 20:37:47 if that doesn't work, oil and sugar make a great scrub that can help take the smell off 

OR if it's onion+garlic that's the problem, rub a stainless steel object (I've used my sink) under running water

1612 2018-02-22 20:27:20 Cool how we can eliminate capital punishment, parole the criminals after serving a fraction of their terms, fill every kid with antipsychotic drugs, take away fathers, and play killer video games 24/7 but the problem is just those damn guns.

1626 2018-02-22 20:25:30 The Left doesn't think 18 year olds should be able to by guns, but sending them to war for oil companies is fine. That way they can bloat their egos with mindless sloganeering: "I support the troops." They think 16 year olds (Tide Pod eaters) should have the Right to Vote, too.

1630 2018-02-22 20:25:24 Hugs or weighted blankets actually do a lot for your nervous system. Sounds hokey, but lavender essential oil may or may not help, asking yourself questions that make you feel grounded, ie, how many doors in this room, what is your mom's birthday, etc. Crying. Showers.

1662 2018-02-22 20:21:53 See, the way you’re behaving online toward a complete stranger you’ve never met is a good indicator of rage bubbling under your surface, and that rage is far more dangerous than shooting a gun at a paper target.
1663 2018-02-22 20:21:47 You've taken the gun issue and moved on to history lessons. Well you Americans have caused more death, pain and suffering to poverty-stricken, innocent civilians the world over than anyone since the British

- Bomb the s*** out of cities under siege.
- Torture detainees.
- Police shouldn't be too nice.
- Opioid addicts shouldn't have started in the first place.
- Arm schoolteachers.

Any idea this man has to fix a problem is the exact opposite of helpful. #ArmMeWith

1682 2018-02-22 20:20:11 Not traders, but long term investors, are avoiding sector, in favour of tech, financials.  Energy outperforms in current late cycle, but habits hard to break. Oil services being hurt because E&P's refusing to increase rates, so have very tight margins, even while working 100%.

1697 2018-02-22 20:18:39 So, in the analysis of risk for a catastrophic environmental event involving an oil pipeline into Vancouver, what role does the likelihood of a major earthquake in the area play? Such earthquakes happen about once every 300 to 500 years.
1698 2018-02-22 20:18:21 No the extraction cost research you've seen is not specific to the UK sector and so you've absolutely no basis to claim more revenue from oil until we see GERS. Plus as you know, the Growth Commission have stated any upside from oil will go to inter-generational projects. Next?

1706 2018-02-22 20:17:12 Mix as well as oil and water. We passed a law like 2 yrs ago allowing guns in bars so long as the gun owner isn't drinking and we've had zero issues with it. Not one violation. They don't want to jeopardize being able to own a gun.

1724 2018-02-22 20:15:23 Doubt it. Can you get a closer image? And ask if there’s a signature? 30k isn’t that much but old and oil with a trained hand doesn’t make it valuable.
1725 2018-02-22 20:15:18 This chart is meaningless in isolation. The accompanying chart in the news release shows oil and gas, respectively, account for ~50 and ~40 million toe.

1763 2018-02-22 20:10:29 Notice the answer you got? He didn't bother to check the validity of your comment. Just assumed it was stupid because it doesn't reinforce what he wants to be true
1764 2018-02-22 20:10:25 The cynic in me says they'd have more friends if they had oil.
1765 2018-02-22 20:10:13 One can support 2A and loathe the NRA. I know I do, especially in light of their divisive ads that try to pit US citizens against each other. It’s possible to support BOTH 2A and sensible checks that protect public safety. I wish NRA would focus on that balance.

1772 2018-02-22 20:10:01 That's pretty much all I use! It's solid at room temp, so it's easier to handle than lube. I find it really mild and soothing. I feel like most lubes mess with my natural balance, but coconut oil is great. 

I also use it on my hair, skin and nails, and cook with it. 
1773 2018-02-22 20:09:57 I have the extraordinary oil! Love that it can be used so many ways @LOrealParisUSA #ElviveRevive
1774 2018-02-22 20:09:48 I do think that because of scarcities of more and more stuff including oil... we see all these saving up on Government spending's for things such as healthcare and schools and so on, yet, they gain massive amounts of privatized gains in terms of money growth which manages to

1787 2018-02-22 20:09:04 Yeah, I'm not arguing that Venezuela is doing great. Just that they're not doing anywhere near as badly as US media portray and would be doing much worse if they had a more "market friendly" government.

The 2014 oil price crash fucked them, 95% of their exports were oil.

1819 2018-02-22 20:04:13 I got peanut butter but this was very natural like just peanuts and oil I'm gonna add honey ack
1820 2018-02-22 20:04:03 Wow.. yeah you see like it takes so little to halt our entire way of life. 
You asked before earlier what can be done and I would say that if someone manages to stop the flow of oil... it will be over in a heartbeat heh.
1821 2018-02-22 20:03:32 Coconut oil is your bestfriend. I used it on my arms and it worked so well
1822 2018-02-22 20:03:27 Oh, and also remember their negligent oil spill(s) that have done so much damage to our planet? I'll not go there...
1823 2018-02-22 20:03:06 It’s really annoying when a middle aged man comes into my store and tells me he’s tired. I talk to him about his diet and tell him he should be taking a fish oil and multi vitamin.
1824 2018-02-22 20:02:50 I read a blog today, mix it with coconut oil and pop it in the microwave! I’ll send it to you
1825 2018-02-22 20:02:48 have an appointment right now to have my car get an oil change & THEN drop it off to get cleaned
1826 2018-02-22 20:02:47 And the only terrorism the US faces is white men that shoot up schools... the only other incedent was 9/11 and don’t get me started on how it was our own government creating an excuse to go to war over oil and opioids...

1836 2018-02-22 20:01:45 Yeah, but isn't tea tree oil a little too strong? I love ALL of your products, but anything with tea tree oil needs to go!
1837 2018-02-22 20:01:38 Yessssir. Not too much. I usually wet my hands and rub my beard as if I was putting on the oil.

1839 2018-02-22 20:01:33 Precisely.

Years ago in the UK was an oil tanker driver strike. It made a huge impression on me because EVERYTHING stopped. It was like some futuristic novel with the whole city silent. In the end the government had to get the army to drive the tankers.

1847 2018-02-22 20:01:07 No #twitch #broadcast today probably. Oil change appointment at 1:30, and other maintenance likely needed. #acura is a nice, but expensive, car. And #Uber takes its toll on the vehicle. Maybe short #streaming of something tomorrow...
1848 2018-02-22 20:01:02 Yes! Then oil, the drug companies and the NRA (and probably a thousand more corporations) will lose their strangle hold on our politics... hopefully.

1854 2018-02-22 20:00:35 Delighted to see #RPT rebound nicely today. Comparing market cap, cash, and free cash flow to other oil and gas companies gives an idea of the upside here. Not to mention a tiny free float. This is perfect cocktail with drill imminent

1859 2018-02-22 20:00:04 Suggest more to do with the impermeability of the shale and limestone at BB. Oil or water mud would make little difference in this type of well. It will only flow "unnaturally" with a stimulated horizontal well. It doesn't have the natural genetics of HH.

1862 2018-02-22 19:59:59 I definitely don't use that much oil.
1863 2018-02-22 19:59:58 Get that cheese. I end up just eating the cheese from the jar, maybe it might make it on an ak-mak. But the oil was not used up and it was a flavor explosion!
1864 2018-02-22 19:59:57 #Trump's reading his talking points again.  He's just the messenger for NRA, oil billionaires, and Russia. How about we spend our time working on our talking points instead of reacting to theirs.
1865 2018-02-22 19:59:46 This sesame oil I got last october was like enough for the whole 6 months.
1866 2018-02-22 19:59:41 Do u have to dampen your beard again to use the beard oil (since it says use 2x a day)
1867 2018-02-22 19:59:34 Yes, they are party to this immense flow of illegal weapons, and the sick toylike craze, and support scrubbing public awareness of their effects, and making it more difficult to track dishonest sellers.  Yes I blame all of them for allowing and encouraging that.
1868 2018-02-22 19:59:28 There's always money for bombing the shit out of the world for oil profits & giant criminal bank bailouts, the question of how are we going to pay for that when it comes to spending on education & healthcare like functional democracies do instead of $700B+ on "defense."
1869 2018-02-22 19:59:28 It was a joke. But honestly using oil is a huge cost savings you could do as a food truck

1876 2018-02-22 19:58:48 Very true. Uncle Sam will not hesitate a second if he smell oil. Will use what it takes to gey hia hand the oil
1877 2018-02-22 19:58:45 You're correct.

1883 2018-02-22 19:57:14 YPG leaders are all delusional and will lose control of Afrin to either Assad or Turkey. Common sense should guide them to Assad. Actually Assad would have more ability to recover oil with Afrin than if it slips away.

1885 2018-02-22 19:57:06 Also India wants energy security. How can Canada provide it to them when we can't even move our oil efficiently or even at all?

1901 2018-02-22 19:54:49 mhh.. According to the "whitepaper", which I have bothered to read, at the beginning  said that the Petro was backed by oil. But in the current WP, it is not. The petro is generated from the crisis and the desperation, and it is very risky. I doubt this is successful

1904 2018-02-22 19:54:03 Thanks Mark.  Curious where you think the wishful thinking bias lies - in the choice of elasticities of supply?  Also curious what qualifies as 'slight' reduction, e.g. for each barrel oil left undeveloped, how much of a barrel reduced oil consumption?

1911 2018-02-22 19:53:31 This is so dumb and should get you banned off of Twitter. Are you trying to say going green is bad?

1946 2018-02-22 19:50:02 @NotJackKemp  What happened at Forney, happened at my Junior High in 8th and 9th grade.  Wrestlers who went up to Trinity came back and started doing it to kids.  They grab a kid when coaches weren't looking, hold down, use anything from pens to brooms.  They called it oil change
1947 2018-02-22 19:49:49 Iran exports are mainly oil aren't they? Truly embargoed rather than supposedly but has their economy totally collapsed
1948 2018-02-22 19:49:40 @US_FDA so you want to ban Kratom, but you allow canola oil? What kind of backwards ass agency is this?  

You approve beaver ass gland secretion,fluoride, paint thinner, & embalming fluid in our food and water!!! I think whoever Making decisions there needs Baker acted.

@POTUS
1949 2018-02-22 19:49:40 tons of soul imports too. Curtis. P Funk. That and post Oil Crisis vinyl so thin you could use it as a wobble board are the period details any discerning yoof film would have to get right to earn my my respect.
1950 2018-02-22 19:49:34 Before I continue, let me point out that you have deaths from cannabis oil in marijuana brownies. Cancer. Going on to harder and harder drugs. Give up admit you are wrong and I will stop.
1951 2018-02-22 19:49:19 It was fun listening to Nicolas Maduro showing of about his new #cryptocurrencie. I'm wondering if he really understands how it works. #politics #finances #oil

1953 2018-02-22 19:49:16 This bag of shit does not have compassion for anyone but himself. He is a full time snake oil salesman.He should be tar and feathered.
1954 2018-02-22 19:49:12 He didn't do that, so maybe you should check your own "logic."
1955 2018-02-22 19:49:11 And big oil, coal etc will all massively back GOP in addition to NRA
1956 2018-02-22 19:49:06 Wow. Someone actually thought the whole "canola oil" thing was funny and original? Is it 1947 again?
1957 2018-02-22 19:48:24 I have never had his many dudes putting oil in my car wtf
1958 2018-02-22 19:48:14 Yeah aside from the fact he's talking total bollocks and no idea of currency exchange, the rest of the world seemingly has no need for oil
1959 2018-02-22 19:48:04 #nowPlaying Midnight Oil - Put Down That Weapon on AIR FM the home of great 80's music
1960 2018-02-22 19:48:01 In response to numerous climate damage lawsuits against them, @chevron has: attacked communities, blamed another oil company, and now… completely omitted that inconvenient nuisance in their risk disclosure to the SEC and shareholders. #cool
1961 2018-02-22 19:47:55 2016: “No you see Clinton had to take oil and gas money but she’s actually going to regulate the industry”
2018: “Taking NRA money is the same as pulling the trigger.
1962 2018-02-22 19:47:54 I’d have the get the ton for it, it doesn’t use oil
1963 2018-02-22 19:47:51 Didn’t you wait till the last minute to change the tire and do an oil change?? Lmaoooo
1964 2018-02-22 19:47:49 Try using lemon, sugar and a drop or two of coconut oil
1965 2018-02-22 19:47:49 Same happened w the yellow bikini you had sun oil on and everyone was like PHOTOSHOP!1!1!
1966 2018-02-22 19:47:41 Look up Mifflin st jore calculator and use that to start tracking macros. Make up calories in are always more than calories burned. Brown rice and unbreaded chicken are your friends. Supplement protein shakes and healthy fats such as MCT oil and avocados
1967 2018-02-22 19:47:41 Didn't his #GOPTAXSCAM cut

Teachers deduction for classroom supplies they purchase?

Funnel money via Devros out of Public schools and into private schools

Seems to me buying books, paper, and pencils should be more important for a school - not bullets and gun oil.
1968 2018-02-22 19:47:27 If they did the #dailyfail wouldn’t employ them.

Look at that MoS hack with his fraudulent graph & photoshoped evidence re climate change being a hoax,  a few months back. Thanks to being well connected with oil ogliarchs & DM shareholders he’s up for an award now!
1969 2018-02-22 19:47:19 I hope you realize you are arguing with me about spending $150 more a year on a $10,000.00 engine to change your oil 2x a year.
1970 2018-02-22 19:47:17 Just found out the olive oil I have been consuming ad nauseam is, more than likely, canola oil - thanks to the Italian mob. I now understand how Regina George felt after eating Kalteen bars to lose weight. "Sweatpants are all that fit me right now."#betrayed
1971 2018-02-22 19:47:12 Oil or liquid? We only clean the food wrappers from the floor of ours when we hear a rustling that can't have come from a human inhabitant of the car...
1972 2018-02-22 19:47:12 UK,US fight against Christian in nigeria because of oil. Today governors in Biafra are more richer than others
1973 2018-02-22 19:47:11 And yet if they change to US friendly gvt investments flow in. It's a currency. And they have resources like oil which are in demand. If other players buy into it then it becomes potentially profitable. We don't know how this ends. It's new territory.
1974 2018-02-22 19:47:00 I couldn't give a fuck if it's an oil rich Russian mob we should be able to do basic fucking defending

This is the most embarrassed I've felt in a long fucking while.

1976 2018-02-22 19:46:41 If corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables i wonder what baby oil is made from?
1977 2018-02-22 19:46:32 Yer but there's no oil there.... Only humans who will grow up hating the west, of which some will become the new Isis members. Who will raise an army, which others will try and stop, which destroys a country, which makes people hate.. I see a cycle.
1978 2018-02-22 19:46:32 i cook mine in the oven! no oil hehe also im not making proper samosas cause the mixture in them is not whats usually in them
1979 2018-02-22 19:46:19 You are funny, Ted.  It was Washington that forced a oil pipeline through farmland through the use of eminent domain.  Trump could have stopped it. #NoDAPL #CPAC2018 #FarmlandIsCriticalInfrastucture

1988 2018-02-22 19:45:24 Take oil of oregano. Seriously, that stuff will KILL a cold. As hubby says, it tastes like gasoline - but it works. Go get some now - I’ll wait. 
1989 2018-02-22 19:45:15 The Principal's Office becomes tactical command and the admin. office can look after heavy artillery. Schools could be set up in oil rich, politically unstable regions to 'educate' the locals... Wait, that's happening now
1990 2018-02-22 19:45:11 The oil in the hash browns? Haha
1991 2018-02-22 19:45:08 I talk a lot of trash for someone who takes 4 Vitamin C’s, Oregano Oil, Spirulina, Echinacea and Rhodiola every morning...
1992 2018-02-22 19:44:54 I would agree w/ you on Malkin but others would not have in the past.

1995 2018-02-22 19:44:08 so 100 million $petro $ptr supply 

pre-sale/ estimate spot per coin is $60 
(correlating roughly to the cost of a barrel of oil) 

trading arbitrage of the Venezuela $PETRO against the value of a barrel of oil is going to be a complete shit show $WTI $HAL $XOM
1996 2018-02-22 19:43:50 I mixed 400g of cooked lentils. Then, I added : salt, pepper, turmeric, fresh parsley. Two tablespoons of sesame oil and 4-5 tablespoons of corn flour (make little bowls with your hands). Then, 15-20 minutes on a stove with a little olive oil 
1997 2018-02-22 19:43:45 Το ελαιόλαδο παράγεται από ελιές. Το ηλιέλαιο από ηλίανθο . Το  σησαμέλαιο από σουσάμι και ούτω καθεξής.  Δεν τολμώ να σκεφτώ από τι  παράγεται το baby oil.
1998 2018-02-22 19:43:44 I guess the service level of "incubators" varies greatly...

this being Britain nothing surprises me, this country's financial industry specializes in selling snake oil... (just one step above Nigerian 404 scams)
1999 2018-02-22 19:43:41 An oil change should be like 15 minuets, I’m tireddddddddd

 Don’t they have a great sense of place?
2006 2018-02-22 19:42:58 but, if it's a repair shop or lube shop, they can really rock it with adwords and targeted facebook - if you know people will come for an oil change every X months (depending on brand), you can set automatic campaigns to run at X month intervals, will get tons of biz that way
2007 2018-02-22 19:42:58 I was a pipeline opponent before the CLP. I saw it as a handout to oil companies. Now I see what we can get from it and know those funds will be going to addressing what I believe is a big problem
2008 2018-02-22 19:42:55 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
2009 2018-02-22 19:42:45 Whoever this is doing the WH briefing should do them all the time.  He is, at least what I've seen, not caustic, rude or degrading reporters.  SHS should be listening.  He's a better snake oil salesman, still selling BS but nicer.

2011 2018-02-22 19:42:33 Holly’s recipe, which is very good: 
1 block extra firm tofu, cut into cubes
1/3 c soy sauce
1/3 c rice wine or sake
1/3 c sesame oil
minced garlic/ginger to taste 

dump it all into a small baking pan, cover with foil, and bake at 325 for about 45-60 minutes.
2012 2018-02-22 19:42:32 Isn’t that exactly what all laws do? They hinder the freedom of everyone because of the harsh reality of abusers. For example: after 9/11 EVERYONE was affected by new TSA security measures, not just those who are terrorists

2014 2018-02-22 19:41:56 It's also possible to go vegan without relying on meat substitutes. Fruits, grains, vegetables, nuts, beans, and soy do not contain genetically modified protein or palm oil.

2037 2018-02-22 19:39:47 I think I bought my pure argan at Trader Joe and got it cheap. Now I use an Organix argan oil serum from Target, also cheap. It is thin and... Serumy? My hair is too fine for heavy oil, but I've hear it does wonders for thicker hair.

2041 2018-02-22 19:38:54 Used coconut oil as lotion and now I smell like a Samoas girl scout cookie
2042 2018-02-22 19:38:52 That is why Arcades faded out. Kids used Mortal Kombat to commit mass murder on a daily basis. Every quarter was a life lost.

2045 2018-02-22 19:38:24 It is SOO GOOD!! I’m addicted! And a little coconut oil goes a long way.
2046 2018-02-22 19:38:22 I want MORE Nurses on the Oil, starting with Sara
2047 2018-02-22 19:38:17 It seems as if the oil is boiling hot. Immerse your hand in the oil and take it out. The boil will be only warm and not boiling, though it looks like boiling oil to the viewers.
2048 2018-02-22 19:38:07 Pour the cooking oil in the pot with the lemon juice squeezed in the oil stealthily. Place it on the fire. Before the oil get hot and boiling, the lime juice settled at the bottom of the pot boils first and oil appears to bubble when the steam is released.
2049 2018-02-22 19:37:55 i am so done with hair products . trying out olive oil for the next 3 months - if this doesn't work i'm done

2052 2018-02-22 19:37:17 If was an Alta. resident, I would be severely distraught that my govt. provided free adverts for a TX oil company on my dime. @RachelNotley
2053 2018-02-22 19:37:05 No this is a travesty. This is the end. This is it. A criminal organization parading as a political party and you're all complicit like you'd all rather play with spinning fidgets than start the necessary Dan Rather level investigations. Forget it. We found an Oil section.
2054 2018-02-22 19:36:58 Good question. Looks like cryptocurrency is the answer. I guess if it works for oil, why not gold?

2058 2018-02-22 19:36:51 It’s well probably close to sardines, but I never had sardines not from the can, so not sure. Has vinegar, oil, salt, green onion, some brine spices.
2059 2018-02-22 19:36:44 He need some oil
2060 2018-02-22 19:36:40 Definitely need coconut oil.
2061 2018-02-22 19:36:37 People pray for cake. Then when they are given batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan and an oven... they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.
2062 2018-02-22 19:36:37 I use the renpure stuff too. Then I usually put argan oil on the ends and sort of run my hands over all of it. I bought the argan at Amazon because it's insane at the drug store.
2063 2018-02-22 19:36:27 I like how evolution deniers are the biggest advocates of the oil and gas industry.

2070 2018-02-22 19:36:02 I always mix it in with whatever I make so it takes on that flavor but when you cook it right before the water boils down completely add some sazón, accent, and adobo. Toss in a lil pepper for balance and add avocado oil to the water when you boil it to really enhance the flavor

2074 2018-02-22 19:35:27 I’ve never used just coconut oil. I liked it because it didn’t weigh my hair down and tamed my super course, curly parts.
2075 2018-02-22 19:35:08 No one is blaming millions of law abiding gun owners. What a tired comment. I think it's not working the way it used to.

2076 2018-02-22 19:35:06 Water will be the oil of the 21st century. Nestle, T. Boone Pickens, and others in the investing community have been buying up water rights all over the globe especially over the last 10 years.
2077 2018-02-22 19:35:02 Seemingly the only time that the numbers shift to "invest for growth" are during super-cycles, such as the telco buildout at the beginning of the century, and the two oil cycles we've had

2079 2018-02-22 19:34:51 @PatrickBMW2 tried to charge me for an oil top off. "Free for 'regular customers.'" Not going to be a customer now. @bmwna
2080 2018-02-22 19:34:41 Carted away what percentage please; What of the one that currently exists. Oil exploitation began mainly after independence.

2083 2018-02-22 19:34:32 I wonder about this on many levels. One question in my mind; "is it true that Saudi is nearly out of oil"?  Is this prep for the future?

2089 2018-02-22 19:33:21 A featureless, limited-palette, oil contamination facility? No idea why you struggled with that
2090 2018-02-22 19:33:21 Retailers profit margins r more important than choices made for our country. Guns, Oil, pharma,media moguls and on and on.

2091 2018-02-22 19:33:20 I have sent hella e-mails this morning. I've also detangled and doing a hot oil treatment. 

I am still in my pajamas but that doesn't mean I'm not productive!
2092 2018-02-22 19:33:20 Sería increíble y fabuloso que quitando al PRI se resolvieran todos estos problemas. Qué fácil sería. Es una visión miope pero padre.
2093 2018-02-22 19:33:16 The oil that is extracted is heavy of very heavy crude, it needs to be mixed with light crude to make a more saleable product, they have to import light crude in $, back to the same problem.
2094 2018-02-22 19:33:07 May as well stop expecting people to know anything or have any sense.  It's a total waste of time and energy.
2095 2018-02-22 19:32:57 And this is differnet from oil companies using the Koch brothers billions to lobby for pipelines? Lmfao. #hypocrite #NothingToSeeHere

2097 2018-02-22 19:32:57 anyone ever hear of fish oil having a bad reaction with joints?
2098 2018-02-22 19:32:51 yeah. i like the idea of having a publicly tradeable natural resource representative token.

but preferably it's  not oil, or Venezuela

2113 2018-02-22 19:30:45 Black Arts Oil, then aristocracy, today still by the most oppressed people.
2114 2018-02-22 19:30:35 Abeg park well,  your bank that has refused to fund a start up company,  even though the contract is with one of the oil majors in Nigeria and account domiciled in your bank.
2115 2018-02-22 19:30:29 For soap I use locally produced black soap and Palm kernel oil for body cream.
2116 2018-02-22 19:30:26 Pellets from my .22 Benjamin can do some damage, too. That's the point.

2121 2018-02-22 19:29:30 Now you can speakout for Biafra Jews and Christians Continued GENOCIDE by the British govt and jihadists for oil. REFERENDUM is the key.
2122 2018-02-22 19:29:11 It blows my mind at the amount of stupid.
2123 2018-02-22 19:29:09 cantu and a good hair oil, go to target
2124 2018-02-22 19:28:56 ((Heheheh. It's usually in oil because it's original purpose was as a salad dressing. ^_^ ))
2125 2018-02-22 19:28:49 Te vas a querer morir al tercer año de gobierno de AMLO, cuando estemos hartos de conflictos, de metidas de pata, sin crecimiento ni educación, peleados con medio mundo.
2126 2018-02-22 19:28:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
2127 2018-02-22 19:28:32 Adulting is spending 30 minutes looking for oil change coupons. Like $5 off? Wtf Is that. Don’t worry. I found a $25 oil change coupon. Let’s get itttttt.
2128 2018-02-22 19:28:20 yes to all of this, EXCEPT! after pressing the hell out of it and cutting it in slabs, freeze flat and then put in a ziploc or container. then pan fry dry until it starts to brown, then add to hot oil and finish it up. it gives it a delightful texture.
2129 2018-02-22 19:28:15 I know I said no more raves. But I feel as long as I got my life together. Pass all my classes. Good financially. Look sexy af. And change my car oil. I deserve to go to #EDC  right?
2130 2018-02-22 19:28:14 Read mine, I stated I have to have my oil changed, comedy gold
2131 2018-02-22 19:28:12 Big oil hates RINS so I say keep it
2132 2018-02-22 19:28:07 There's no pure private self-rage than there ever was to take from everyone for anyone's oil as a presumed worldstate fuel.  Solidarity disappeared; all our other laws are more strict than could exist as pure opposition to lost moral teaching, if you're cold g'love </1 next door.
2133 2018-02-22 19:28:02 Reminds me of the cryptobolivar Maduro wants to do. "It's gonna be backed by oil reserves...and a basket of other commodities"....like the Bolivar was. Some people don't seem to get this, but just because it's crypto doesn't mean you can't debase it like any other currency.
2134 2018-02-22 19:28:00 But albertans first. You said it yourself. Your family works in the oil and gas business. #cheapgasforallcanadians
2135 2018-02-22 19:27:58 Yeah, I was expecting better too.
2136 2018-02-22 19:27:58 Most Bernie supporters didn't care about her e-mails Trump lambasted her for. Like Bernie said no one cares (apart from the republicans). Her problem was that she received immense donations from big banks, super pacs, oil companies, fossil fuel companies, fracking, etc.
2137 2018-02-22 19:27:48 guys someone in my lab spilled a ton of vegetable oil on the floor and the first thing out of my mouth was “RUN IN HERE COME GET YALL JUICE” im going to hell
2138 2018-02-22 19:27:29 72 hours is an extremely short amount of time for an oil painting that isn't just like a study or a sketch - at least with the way I tend to work. I think I actually ended up doing an acrylic underpainting bc it dries faster and then painting oil over top
2139 2018-02-22 19:27:26 ((We have herb mixes for meats or fish usually, but not in oil, except as novelty items.))

2141 2018-02-22 19:27:23 Está bueno el artículo, hace pensar.
Pero para mí, creer que Anaya pueda ser presidente de México, o que tenga chance siquiera, es no conocer el país en que habitamos.
Puedo estar equivocado, por supuesto.
2142 2018-02-22 19:27:16 Use essential oils in an oil burner in your home to lifts your spirits or add a few drops to your bath for a relaxing experience.

2144 2018-02-22 19:27:13 "Back to the Future": my government sees oil and gas as its future #NLAdvance2030; My university @MemorialU financial services decided electronic signatures are not good anymore. Backward... one step at a time!
2145 2018-02-22 19:27:10 Not so sure. It has bad press with its Palm oil ...
2146 2018-02-22 19:27:06 Read my tweet bot. I said NO ONE CHANGES THEIR OWN OIL!

2148 2018-02-22 19:26:55 Cannabis. Without the THc which is what makes you stoned. Health food stores have it. Oil, cream, spray for intake.
2149 2018-02-22 19:26:53 Who can listen to him speak? Such a poor communicator talks like an uneducated                      inarticulate not so slick but sleazy snake oil salesman!
2150 2018-02-22 19:26:51 I just bought a tea tree oil that’s just the oil and I’ve been applying it! So far tea tree oil is the look 
2151 2018-02-22 19:26:46 im so gross my hair is oil

2153 2018-02-22 19:26:45 What's your conclusion then? He asked for a bunch of donations promising to dig up evidence. Instead he put out a bunch of drivel and then asked for more donations.

My conclusion is snake oil.
2154 2018-02-22 19:26:30 Calling them "law abiding" doesn't make much sense in this case. The laws - as created by politicians who are bought & paid for by @NRA, which doesn't even represent the interests of most gun owners much less most Americans - are the problem.
2155 2018-02-22 19:26:28 The gun owner victim complex is fascinating to observe.
2156 2018-02-22 19:26:28 I remember I was the oil and history was water 
2157 2018-02-22 19:26:19 Tea tree oil is fr doing wonders to my hair 
2158 2018-02-22 19:26:18 Like comparing oil and water.... That switch was replacing capacity with loyalty
2159 2018-02-22 19:26:14 I am now looking back & appreciating the last time I got my heart fukked bc it led me to do the gayest most cancer thing (write a poem abt it, make it into a book, & then coat it in lavender oil & carry it with me everywhere for 2 months) bc this happened, I am curating SCENTS 
2160 2018-02-22 19:26:02 So right now it’s the body shops tea tree line! I use all of it and it’s really calmed and soothed my acne. I also use pixies aloe mud cleanser occasionally. Because I have eczema I have to use rose hip oil too and bish that shit hydrates the shit out of my skin.
2161 2018-02-22 19:26:01 If you don’t put coconut oil in ur hair after a cut wyd
2162 2018-02-22 19:26:00 I spilled my Red Bull in my cup holder this morning and I didn’t have anything to clean it up so I told myself I would do it later. Fast forward to right now, I took my car to get an oil change and there’s still a puddle of Red Bull in the cup holder and I’m mortified...
2163 2018-02-22 19:25:54 we involve everywhere .and eventually achieving nothing. just wasting our oil revenue in the middle east .and our soldiers' life
2164 2018-02-22 19:25:49 No, money/jobs/economic development is one thing...but environmental issues, potential oil spills, irreparable damage to our environment from development, and a new wave of colonisers to contend with is a whole new set of problems ... if it comes to that.
2165 2018-02-22 19:25:43 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
2166 2018-02-22 19:25:31 Suffering from #acne? Combine 1 tsp of #turmeric with 2 tbsp of #coconut #oil. Drink this & then eat 5 or 6 #walnuts or #almonds.

2172 2018-02-22 19:24:51 I think step 1 is the best/firmest you can get, and press the hell out of it. Cut into cubes/slabs & pan-fry it in pretty hot oil until it gets crispy, add to whatever sauce you like (I put it in thai curry a lot)
ALSO I have a tofu piccata recipe that's amazing if you want that
2173 2018-02-22 19:24:38 People chanting "burn her" at Dana Loesch is okay but Seb Gorka shoving a urinalist is not.
2174 2018-02-22 19:24:36 I'm going to look into monoi oil since I stop using coconut. It gotta be lighter . Thanks!

2176 2018-02-22 19:24:27 Wish I could say the same for Megan Woods.... I tried contacting her over oil and gas but it appears she is too busy meeting with PEPANZ and industry reps.
2177 2018-02-22 19:24:22 Antioxidants and monounsaturated fatty acids found in extra virgin olive oil can help to decrease inflammation and lower the risk of coronary events such as heart attacks
2178 2018-02-22 19:24:18 - i wonder if my mama will let me take her car. mine needs an oil change that it’s not getting until next week
2179 2018-02-22 19:24:17 Oilers would. Cap is going up $5-$7 million, korp’s $1M hit coming off the books as well. Assuming Oil can fill remaining spots at status quo of 17-18, then could even afford to sign him at $10M/
2180 2018-02-22 19:24:04 Me, too. Also, fellow pet owners have shared on FB the dangers of essential oil diffusers for cats and dogs. It's making them very sick. As a bird owner, I know better than to use anything like that around G, but a heads up for dog and cat owners.
2181 2018-02-22 19:23:45 See you! Oil money no dey decrease, bruh
2182 2018-02-22 19:23:28 .@DougDeMuro When I was accepted to university, I tend to buy Cherokee XJ from 997 model year but with facelifted chrome grill installed , Country trim level, black one which has AR wheels. I could not buy the car because owner forgot to change oil and burn the engine :(
2183 2018-02-22 19:23:26 2 places to get oil changed in town. 1 rhymes w/ Spiffy Tube & they're always: EVERYTHING is broken on your car, pay us to fix it! So I went to Tall-Tart & they literally forgot about me bc they lost my paperwork. Trapped in Tall-Tart for two hours 
2184 2018-02-22 19:23:24 NO. You won't. you get nothing done unless it hurts the USA. Treasonous what you're doing to this country. Selling off our beautiful parks to big oil? You can't tell me you're not getting rich off your POTUS status. Well - you do say that, but no one believes it. oh - your base.
2185 2018-02-22 19:23:22 "Why won't you let me looove you?"

2188 2018-02-22 19:22:42 The problem weren't her policy proposals. During the general election her platform was great. Her problem was believability and trust. No one believed her because she told big bankers, oil companies one thing and voters another to pander them.

*bulk buys Jamaican Castor oil*
2190 2018-02-22 19:22:39 The US tried to overthrow the Left soon after taking power in VZ.

*After* that failed attempt, VZ's GDP quadrupled, and human development was excellent.

*Then* the oil price crashed, and US upped economic war. 

Yeah, they should have diversified. But ignoring rest is bullshit.

Holy crap ... that tanked them ... -40%,  single day carnage.

2202 2018-02-22 19:21:12 Fish oil supplements are for when you want all of the sushi burps and none of the satisfaction of actually having eaten sushi.
2203 2018-02-22 19:21:09 Apparently they found oil seeps so they're talking about exploring it to determine if its significant.
2204 2018-02-22 19:20:46 Just bought a new tire for my car last week now I have to buy another today & get my oil changed 
2205 2018-02-22 19:20:44 Don't let those "burdensome regulations" that protect air, water, soil, wildlife, & PEOPLE get in the way of the Oil Industry from making an easy buck & chump change for our state & citizens. Remember that you can spend your Trump brown nosing points in Hell (not valid in Heaven)
2206 2018-02-22 19:20:43 Hate getting oil changes
2207 2018-02-22 19:20:42 Brown your rice in oil first, then add stewed tomatoes, chicken stock, and seasonings and let it boil down!  #voila

influenced kids.
2213 2018-02-22 19:20:10 Babes, trust me when I say I've used almost everything Clicks has to offer in terms of natural hair care (except Carol's Daughter). Shea Moisture's Jamaican Black Caster Oil Leave-In Conditioner and Design essentials leave in mask are the only heros.
2214 2018-02-22 19:20:10 And he's not bought & paid for by NRA, Russia, China, Turkey, India, Suadi Arabia, Big Oil, Koch Brothers, etc., etc., etc..
2215 2018-02-22 19:20:05 If BC can ban Canadian made oil, then AB can ban BC made wine. It goes both ways, like Horgan.
2216 2018-02-22 19:19:35 At this time of night? Really? It's dark. Aaannnnd, no one changes their own oil....

At any one  time, the  pipeline can contain a rainbow of crude oil, jet fuel and  diesel. This  means that..

2226 2018-02-22 19:18:19 Nah, we’re just gonna blame the infantile fantasists that think their hobby trumps common sense safety measures.  Oh, and the gun lobby propagandists at the NRA.

2244 2018-02-22 19:16:24 With the amount of money that can be made from agriculture & mining, they should free oil tbh.
2245 2018-02-22 19:16:19 I wasn't just stock water, that's people's drinking water too. Wells are few an deep windmills don't pull that deep water. When they brought out tanks, the tanks were contaminated old oil tanks when they put water in them it came out mixed with raw crude oil .

2250 2018-02-22 19:15:36 I'm kinda happy with myself because earlier my family was eating a super calorie infested and greasy dinner: potatoes with lots of oil and cheese  and I said no thanks and had a glass of water instead. I'm happy about that :))

2272 2018-02-22 19:13:11 A question I get: Will Chavismo allow Henri Falcón, a covert Chavista, to win #Venezuela's presidency to create sense of renewal. Answer: No. Maduro didn't scrap a referendum, create a constitutional assembly and hand over oil to the military only to surrender power to Falcón.
2273 2018-02-22 19:13:05 And if he fails to do so ? Another 4 points on top of the 12 ?
2274 2018-02-22 19:13:04 My life flashes before my eyes every time the oil pops up when I'm cooking
2275 2018-02-22 19:12:59 yeah it’s weird. they had a 15$ special and i had a 15$ reward card plus a 10$ mail in rebate so basically their paying me 10$ to get my oil changed 
2276 2018-02-22 19:12:55 Wow
2277 2018-02-22 19:12:45 For a neat prank, switch your friend’s vanilla ice cream with mayonnaise and their chocolate syrup with motor oil
2278 2018-02-22 19:12:42 Maybe our hair doesn't naturally get greasy.. That is what big oil wants you to think..

2282 2018-02-22 19:12:28 Oil has a lot of useful applications. No one is suggesting ending it. The issue is the the increased export to Asia and significant threat to Burrard Inlet and the coast. Many countries have policies to reduce oil consumption over time, primarily in transportation and heating.
2283 2018-02-22 19:12:17 Extra sugar? Extra salt? Extra oil and MSG?
2284 2018-02-22 19:12:06 well that is an exciting thought. This could turn around fairly quickly then.

2286 2018-02-22 19:11:39 @POTUS I was hoping that you'd find other ways to get the oil from our land.. frakking is destroying our land and what's underneath our land. Our earth needs to be taken into consideration. We have $$. Research better ways to get our oil out other than frakking. Please!

2292 2018-02-22 19:10:59 Perfume oils are basically perfumes in Oil form without alcohol, ethanol or any fillers like perfumes. 

They tend to be a bit “warmer” than perfumes because they don’t contain alcohol. 

Perfume oils can be inspired by a brand or made by the brand, mine is the former.
2293 2018-02-22 19:10:56 You should probably get busy building more oil pipelines then—I hear that’s the solution. 
2294 2018-02-22 19:10:56 Who else has noticed
That the oil in condoms
Has reduced after increment of fuel ??

2295 2018-02-22 19:10:47 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
2296 2018-02-22 19:10:47 Yea, but I can see the same thing happening quickly. Oil companies buying lots of land searching for oil and displacing people. Then leasing back the land a few years later.
2297 2018-02-22 19:10:42 2/ Not all EV ambition is "green, or economic positioning, much is reliance on foreign oil.  It is the achiles heel of China, from both an economic and military, standpoint.

2309 2018-02-22 19:08:33 I'm no expert but when you say 'we' you seem to be suggesting Scotland   owns & produces the oil?

2328 2018-02-22 19:05:17 You mentioned nothing about India's appetite for our oil/LNG that Trudeau intentionally ignored, which could have represented $$ Billions in revenue. Trudeau didn't even bring his Resources Minister with him .. but he did bring an Indian chef .. to India.
2329 2018-02-22 19:05:11 That’s okay though, one day some mans gunna have no problem with me doing his laundry and changing his oil in the same day. 
2330 2018-02-22 19:04:54 I wouldn't say they haven't made threats against us but what could they feasibly do and what do expect? A lot of people believe the oil lobby runs the U.S. but if that was true, we would have had oil exports from there in the 90s. IMO, Iran is very comparable to Vietnam.

2336 2018-02-22 19:03:44 Something something, extra olive oil
2337 2018-02-22 19:03:43 as oil goes directly to the Gulf Coast for export that spread makes sense... ie. is demand still very strong and wti-brent no longer a good indicator of export levels?

2357 2018-02-22 19:01:08 my hair gets oily so easily so i usually don’t put conditioner near my roots just the ends of my hair then i bleached my hair to pink and it’s worse idk if it’s bc my scalp could be dryer so it produces more oil or what
2358 2018-02-22 19:01:06 .@jjhorgan and @GeorgeHeyman to provide update on BC’s oil pipeline regulations at 2:30pm today. Likely to be details on BC’s planned “public consultation” before it actually drafts regulations into reality.
2359 2018-02-22 19:01:05 It should not take two hours to Chang your oil. #toyota 
2360 2018-02-22 19:01:02 Plus it's more expensive than a gallon of gas now. I just dip my finger in Canola oil, rub my lips and call it a day now.
2361 2018-02-22 19:00:52 If we’re pre-blaming trump for oil spills, who should we blame for Deepwater Horizon after the fact?
2362 2018-02-22 19:00:41 Since y'day I've been seeing all sort oil on ma TL...from coconut oil to olive and all dems...and those ladies with dem natural hair , they look damn good. Pls ladies, can guys use some of those products cos ma hair looks like ma hair-cream was made with frytol.

2370 2018-02-22 19:00:06 Did you know that some castor oils have been washed with hexane? Not St. Francis Castor Oil. It's organic & comes in a dark glass bottle.

2372 2018-02-22 18:59:55 Yep. A cost to OPEC and dependence on foreign oil. America is Winning! Thank you @realDonaldTrump

2374 2018-02-22 18:59:42 يارب يصلح حالنا ويهدينا
2375 2018-02-22 18:59:41 Ask yourself why are Americans funding the blocking of Canadian oil while achieving RECORD exports of their own? Then they turn around and buy our landlocked oil at a 40% discount? Why? Damn fools in Canada. That’s why. You must be a big Trump economy supporter?

2377 2018-02-22 18:59:20 You mean the russian air force ... US did not even want to bomb oil convoys from daesh to turkey ...
2378 2018-02-22 18:59:17 Change is inevitable. The outcomes of changes lies in the motives of the beholder. Whatever you believe you want you will get. So Jamaica what do you want from the oil discovery?
2379 2018-02-22 18:58:58 It’s already a full blown proxy war. Has been for a long time, although things are getting more intense.
According to Mintpress News, the US airforce killed hundreds of Russian mercenaries, a few days ago, in a battle over an oil refinery
2380 2018-02-22 18:58:48 Destroying forests for PALM Oil?  Disgusting. #PalmOil is also unhealthy, it’s the worst for bad cholesterol. Aren’t there like 100  other plant oils that can be used in these products?
2381 2018-02-22 18:58:42 paying for oil changes suckkkkk
2382 2018-02-22 18:58:36 Waiting two hours at the dealership for a oil change is great.....
2383 2018-02-22 18:58:19 The Argon oil leave in?
2384 2018-02-22 18:58:14 China just wants the access to the oil without confrontation. PLAN  knows it has no hope against a US battle group let alone the US pacific fleet.
2385 2018-02-22 18:58:12 Baby oil cures ash, but even a lil bit is waaaay too muhfuckin much
2386 2018-02-22 18:58:11 Watermelon lip buff and lip butter, made with hemp, Shea butter, hemp oil and watermelon taste, a bit of pink mica for a baby pink colour!
2387 2018-02-22 18:57:59 I'm getting an oil change and there's this mom who is with her daughter who is speaking with a British accent. I asked the mom if they're British and the mom replies "no, she just watches too much Peppa Pig" I am dying!!!!!

2393 2018-02-22 18:57:40 Happy to see that our PM is out promoting Canada and trade, just wondering #when will the oil flow to tidal waters so we can get fair market value for our resources? #when will you have time to step in and finish what you started with the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion?

2396 2018-02-22 18:57:24 what about palm oil in dairy food? (excludes animal fat) ^^
2397 2018-02-22 18:57:16 #OOTT | It’s a constructive report. Declining storage in Cushing boosted prices, and we will continue to see that as crude is directed to the Gulf Coast for export. cc. @tortoise_invest #WTI #Brent #Oil
2398 2018-02-22 18:57:10 I meant re: oil
2399 2018-02-22 18:57:02 If you ever waited four hours for an oil change, you'd never go back right? Thats just logic.
2400 2018-02-22 18:56:57 Typical bloody run out of oil & it's going to be the coldest spell in 5 years! Can't get oil till Monday #Oil #anyonegotanyheaters? 
2401 2018-02-22 18:56:44 They don’t have religion, no religion teaches death and murder. They’re pagans. And even pagans can live without anyone harming them. Saudi Arabia is financing and funding extremism and giving a bad name to Islam for nearly a 100 years... they worship Gold oil and money

2403 2018-02-22 18:56:25 Agreed, I think most politicians are for the 2nd amendment but to what extent is where it varies. When over 90% of your $ comes from big oil and NRA there views becomes your views. Common sense guns laws don’t seem so common.
2404 2018-02-22 18:56:24 I mean, honestly, I could change my own oil but with my luck, the car will fall on me or some shit 
2405 2018-02-22 18:56:18 Is paying the fines for hazardous Fracking in South Florida more profitable than missing out on the financial opportunity?  After Exxon Valdez and the Gulf spills, the big oil companies are still turning a hefty profit!
2406 2018-02-22 18:56:17 Curious to see if #BlueJays and/or Donaldson would settle on a 5yr/$130M deal w/ an opt out after three. ($30M,$30M,$35M,$20M,$15M). My guess is he can get 4yr/$110-120M on the open market. @bnicholsonsmith @SNJeffBlair
2407 2018-02-22 18:56:10 Fucked around and set my scalp on fire putting this peppermint oil on in the shower feel like my damn roots are growing!!

2409 2018-02-22 18:55:59 @YETICoolers Hi! What are Rambler lids made of (both the bottles and the cups)? I put MCT oil in my coffee and the label says not to use with plastics except HDPE because the MCT reacts with many of them. Thank you!
2410 2018-02-22 18:55:38 Plays lazy.  I’ve been watching hockey for a long time.  He’s lazy.   Not a good look for a guy that young who just got paid
2411 2018-02-22 18:55:00 IMO, OPEC+ is will go all out to end oil over-hang, before US-TO can get to full prod. They see the prod increase, at $55 & see now is last chance for fast stock draw. I expect major prod reductions by KSA/RUS, through H1. Shale prod+100%, no matter 55 or 75.
2412 2018-02-22 18:54:49 Hi Gwennan, we were out today and we're out tomorrow on #oilspill clean up, from Old Ford Lock in Hackney Wick with @CanalRiverTrust (volunteers welcome!) but our regular Sunday litterpick is at Limehouse and thankfully the oil hasn't spread that far yet.
2413 2018-02-22 18:54:33 Pre-Saudi Arabia: West was where the culture /Islam' origins. East: where was oil & majority Shias. Centre: Desert. Including Najd, base of Abdul wahab. Saud came from Yemen, colluded with Wahab, did genocide of millions to conquer East & West and established Saudi Arabia.
2414 2018-02-22 18:54:30 Tea tree oil is also very harmful to animals! It’s not that they don’t like it, it’s that their bodies can’t break down the oils unfortunately :( makes them super sick
2415 2018-02-22 18:54:26 Yes, just eyeballing it they’re all either drillers or onshore US shale oil/gas players
2416 2018-02-22 18:54:20 I haven’t done a hot oil treatment.. it’s been too long
2417 2018-02-22 18:54:18 So what does he have to say on scottish fishing grounds, scottish agriculture, scottish oil, fracking in Scotland?
2418 2018-02-22 18:54:01 Actually,  OIL is the icing on the cake.  Read the Wolfowitz Doctrine which literally spells out the 'World Domination' agenda the Neocons lust for.
2419 2018-02-22 18:53:53 when i use flash they just expose all my pores and excess oil wtf

2438 2018-02-22 18:51:53 Except you've lived all your life in a rural/remote place where manual farming/trading is the order. It would be sheer foolishness to pick joy&poverty over wealth&sadness.

Poverty and Happiness are like oil and water, the two don't mix at all.

Be sad in wealth, lesser evil.
2439 2018-02-22 18:51:49 I had to comb my cat and spray her with a natural oil because she has fleas  and she is literally so pissed at me right now. I have to approach her with both my hands up and she still hissed at me.

"See? Like that. That's the order. Let's make around 5 and we fry those, then the next batch. I feel like we can makeup to 20 easily."

Moving the pan in circles to spread the oil, Gardna started preparing another fish piece, peaking at her with a smile.

2456 2018-02-22 18:50:10 Big money is behind much of the USA’s issues. Tobacco, pharmaceuticals, insurance, weapons manufacturers, oil & gas industries, to name a few, make decisions based upon profit margins, not for the good of mankind as a whole.

2459 2018-02-22 18:50:04 Omega-3 fatty acids play an essential role in stabilizing mood. The best sources are fatty fish such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, sardines, tuna, and some cold-water fish oil supplements.

2465 2018-02-22 18:48:54 I’ve nothing more to say. Anyone arguing that a six-month effort is literally achievable in half an hour is promoting outright snake oil. I can’t be any more blunt than that. Declaring it to be true, as you are doing, doesn’t make it true or plausible or remotely defensible.
2466 2018-02-22 18:48:53 Agree with Gerald.  $CPG sells in near WTI prices and much production goes thru Manitoba rather then Alberta, onwards to I believe Phillips 66 USA by Enbridge Line.  CPG lost 3x its value in just over a yr despite oil up nearly 50%. Ridiculous.

2482 2018-02-22 18:47:02 That’s poor design, usually it’s just a hole higher up to squirt the oil in from below and a drain at the bottom. I thought you meant he was doing it himself.
2483 2018-02-22 18:46:57 A few questions for you @KylieJenner 1.) Did your Mom short $SNAP before your tweet? 2.) How often are you using $TWTR these days? 3.) Do you think $ZN really found oil in Israel?
2484 2018-02-22 18:46:44 @EcoQuantIntel Day, may be Eco could suggest the better vehicle to ride this downside in oil - $DRIP or $DWT
2485 2018-02-22 18:46:41 Will, if you listen to the audio, when Gorka walked away, the leftist reporter said "When are you going to have that fight with me?", Gorka declined, then the reporter said "Why?, are you scared?" while walking to within inches of his face. He was clearly trying to start a fight.
2486 2018-02-22 18:46:35 The age old question. Do you buy and hold or do you bunt for quick return over and over again.i only play oil and gold sector.

2488 2018-02-22 18:46:34 I’ve recently become obsessed with the tortilla chips. They’re salsa Fresca flavored and are cooked in coconut oil... they’re vegan and gluten free and they’re SO yummy
2489 2018-02-22 18:46:34 I like the way oil and gas related companies are now calling themselves "Integrated energy solutions" company, because how else will they justify succumbing to the power of renewable energy!
2490 2018-02-22 18:46:17 what part did scottish oil play in the Thatcher economic miracle ? - how will the tories pull another rabbit out the hat? sale of the NHS?

2492 2018-02-22 18:46:10 When you lack ideas, it's hard to think outside the box.

All they know is oil and that's where all their attention is focused.

Ironic that the "clueless" GEJ did not suffer from such tunnel vision.

2519 2018-02-22 18:41:55 It’s more complex: Chavez tried to take a country that had history of dictators & establish democracy. Problem is economy is entirely based on oil therefore pegged to $. The oil global companies loved him at first! But poor policy/ corruption,$ debt= meltdown

2524 2018-02-22 18:40:55 Think of growing station food vending machines that are placed like bus stops , and pretty much the size of bus stops to grow the food right there in the city. The currency would be plastic bottles. That would get melted down to oil again on site.

2541 2018-02-22 18:38:57 They said "go to @jiffylube their fast and cheap for oil changes" well after a month of repairs and $1500 later here we are.  Thanks!
2542 2018-02-22 18:38:24 When will that over hyped snake oil salesman go away.  He is over thank God.  Obama ruined our country by letting small groups with big mouths take over.  Sorry ass-wipes but the truth is he "sucks" always has always will.  Deal with it!

You could ask drumpf about his meeting with the NSDAP following an oil spill, and he'd s say the same thing.  "Yeah, the top guy, he's doing a lot of great things."
2550 2018-02-22 18:36:24 I just want some garlic and olive oil pasta.

2563 2018-02-22 18:34:48 Let oil price rise to $120 per barrel. That when we will know how huge this is.
2564 2018-02-22 18:34:46 Yay! I’m hyped to use it, I usually just used witch hazel with tea tree oil but I decided to get fancy lol

2573 2018-02-22 18:33:48 I put peppermint oil on my body to try to see if it will help me tan and if it will keep the birds away. So far so good
2574 2018-02-22 18:33:47 The Saudi's supply the West so much oil, so when they say "Assad must go",the West swings into action. 
So ISIS and AL NUSRA (a. k. a FSA) start getting loads of ammunition. 
Just one problem, the the Russians and Iranians didn't read the script. #Syria

2578 2018-02-22 18:32:48 Hello. Yes and thank you. We are passionated by our languages (mine is Berrichon-Bourbonnais , among Oïl languages but there are about 27 in European France and 79 counting Overseas territories !!)
2579 2018-02-22 18:32:45 It used to be Tremblay after the Roy debacle..but MB was like, hold my beer. lit himself on fire and dove onto a slip and slide covered in oil that threw him into a building full of fireworks.

2582 2018-02-22 18:32:22 The 1960s were better than the 1950s to the extent Brits had learned that not all vegetables need to be boiled to pulp, but olive oil was sold motly by pharmacists (an ear-ache treatment) & garlic was used only by vampire-phobes.

2592 2018-02-22 18:30:55 Trump policies are built on his friendships not for the good of humanity. If he helps to continue to line the pockets of oil tycoons & weapons dealers, they in turn spend more on him. GREED is no way to run a country.

2599 2018-02-22 18:30:14 It's funny how all the other oil producing nations didn't see a similar crash despite the falling oil prices. 
2600 2018-02-22 18:30:11 Peppermint oil to the head works sometimes if you can get past the burn sensation, cut back on cheese and dairy products.
2601 2018-02-22 18:30:10 Another Trudeau divide and conquer move - Farmers vs Oil. He is trying his hardest is drive deep divisions wherever he can. This is what happens when you let pooches run the provinces/country.

2618 2018-02-22 18:28:01 Only argument against medically prescribed cannabis oil is that it’ll be a precursor to legalising cannabis for sale to the public.
Yet opiates (methadone, Subutex, DF painkillers etc) have been prescribed 
for decades and no suggestion heroin will be legalised.

2623 2018-02-22 18:27:39 Britain has never shown love to the people that occupy the Eastern Nigeria.

2626 2018-02-22 18:27:36 I put up a Facebook status about needing a nerdy BFF and the response was so great that now my next status will either be ‘needs someone to change her oil’ or ‘needs someone to bang’.

Try adding Mid-East oil to that milk and see what it looks and tastes like. Diversity is bad for cultures. It will get to the point where the cultures and nations no longer exist.

2639 2018-02-22 18:25:43 What's wrong out West? Thought Alberta was going nowhere before & after they struck sandy oil. 40 years of conservative nowhere, that's why the NDP are in Alberta. Best look at these PC clowns needing to find a leader again.
2640 2018-02-22 18:25:36 Love too buy 200 gallons of oil per month
2641 2018-02-22 18:25:34 ISIS/AL is one side of the story. But the first and last chapter is Oil and addiction to it.
2642 2018-02-22 18:25:24 I told my grandma how I just bought some oil and she tries schooling me by saying "I hate to break it to you but it's actually called wax honey" like ok grandma 
2643 2018-02-22 18:25:07 @jaketapper you mean those kids ar'nt reading the scrips they were given.
2644 2018-02-22 18:25:01 i need a oil change & a lil detailing
2645 2018-02-22 18:25:00 Now the IRS uses NSA parallel constructs to pour boiling oil down ours
2646 2018-02-22 18:24:56 Getting to some theoretical optimum decades from now is not the point. Over the next 22 year the oil industry will invest some $10T just to maintain status quo. EVs can replace all transport demand at a fraction of the investment. Delaying transition is suboptimal.
2647 2018-02-22 18:24:51 OOO NICE MY TEACHER LET US DO COMICS AND CHARACTER DESIGNS AND I GOT AWAY WITH DOING A GRAPHIC NOVEL ADAPTATION OF INTO THE WILD 

I SWEAR THAT GIRL THE DAY IT WAS DUE HAD OIL PAINTINGS AT HOME TRYING TO DRY THEM SHE BROUGHT THEM IN THE NEXT DAY RIGHT BEFORE HER BOARD WAS SENT
2648 2018-02-22 18:24:43 I had oil heat when I lived there too. It sucks big time.
2649 2018-02-22 18:24:29 “Maybe they surprise you? Doesn’t hurt to ask?” 

Lynda smiles at Freya across the pan, using a dish towel to wipe at her sweaty brow, using the spatula to turn the newest additions within the oil before scooping a meatball out »
2650 2018-02-22 18:24:27 You practically stole Patrick's car and now you expect him to wash it and change the oil too? Its time to get out of take down mode and focus on building.
2651 2018-02-22 18:24:25 What’s going to happen when we start running out of oil ???  Should we ban guns. ??? Is just the last man standing scenario  ??? Support the NRA ! And civil defense .
2652 2018-02-22 18:24:08 Ok, here’s a question for you. My son’s doing a big service on a 2006 Disco tomorrow. Usual stuff, oil/oil filter, gearbox oil/filter, diff oil etc. How much do you reckon?
2653 2018-02-22 18:24:02 I have a septic system and oil heat but paved roads
2654 2018-02-22 18:23:46 Even more terrifying if the heating  oil industry try to green their fuels by  mixing with  bio product from growing stuff instead of food!
2655 2018-02-22 18:23:22 Same as Cadbury’s- palm oil is the enemy.
2656 2018-02-22 18:23:20 So. You can’t just arm the school and leave the front door wide open. The “guards” would have to be trained and skilled shooters. Can’t just stick anyone in there. Don’t worry, they’ll figure it out if Dems will consider anything besides a constitutional amendment. Not likely.
2657 2018-02-22 18:23:20 You have no shame Russian embassy, you even use a photo of the civilians your bombing in your "statement", is it where you admit your bombing to protect your military base on the Mediterranean or that you have all the oil and gas rights in Syria to pay for propping up a dictator?
2658 2018-02-22 18:23:17 He only supports the killing of innoscents, not killing in self-defense.
2659 2018-02-22 18:23:08 I poured myself a delicious glass of olive oil this week.
2660 2018-02-22 18:22:47 Smell like an essential oil diffuser today
2661 2018-02-22 18:22:43 Avocado oil for the win
2662 2018-02-22 18:22:40 What is this?  Goalpost moving day?  We are talking about choice in regards to guns, and you come out of your mom's basement and talk about national parks and oil rigs.
2663 2018-02-22 18:22:39 #NoCollusionMyAss #ParklandStudentsSpeak  Sir.. Also Why has Trump been allowed by Congress to flagrantly disobey a Congressional Order for Sanctions vs Russia ,same sanctions that upset Tillersons historic Arctic oil deal for EXXON with Putin and Trumps 3 Hotel Deals there., ?
2664 2018-02-22 18:22:37 We know there are calls for reform, yes. But we don’t need to hear the NRA’s junk science over and over. The same way we don’t need to hear from oil and gas every time there’s a serious hurricane.
2665 2018-02-22 18:22:24 while there are horrific school shootings happening in the US, canada is arguing like middle schoolers at recess over oil

2669 2018-02-22 18:21:51 @oilfractals @Oil_Tradr Big Blue Up? I am in the middle of a city in Bolivia with barely any internet. What exactly happened today? How was EIA? I can't see it as my internet is limited and about to die.
2670 2018-02-22 18:21:44 Vzlan people* have been cut off of free market. Gvmnt officials have now been cut off of their secret stashes. During the period with highest oil prices, the same folks who now bring you Petro, stole it all. They have no choice but to cling onto power. Can’t say it’s not clever.
2671 2018-02-22 18:21:39 Oil strong today. About time.
2672 2018-02-22 18:21:20 Please try 1/2 tsp organic coconut oil 2 times a day if diagnosis is seizures or epilepsy.  For many dogs this is a miracle oil
2673 2018-02-22 18:21:19 CVE, ARX, SU are WCS impacted, but CVE and SU are integrated.  CPG, VET are not much exposed to Alberta mkt.  CPG is a NA (CDN/USA) oil play, with mid to light grade oil, 90% oil.  VET is more international, with Brent off-shore exposure, and Euro/NA natgas. I will soon buy CPG.
2674 2018-02-22 18:21:10 2. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a frying pan over high heat.
Add onion and capsicum. Cook, stirring, for 4 minutes or until soft.

2675 2018-02-22 18:21:03 Handsome yt repair man was v nervous when we spoke. Saw myself in the mirror after & now it’s clear why. Ironically, he was covered in confederate tattoos & I’m in a tie-dye President Obama t-shirt & ankara headwrap with frankincense & tea tree oil diffusing. He was shook

2681 2018-02-22 18:20:28 Everything is "fast," "beautiful," and "special" with Trump. When will the remaining 1/3 of Americans who support him wake up and smell the snake oil.
2682 2018-02-22 18:20:23 I’m pretty basic when it comes to daily maintenance. I usually wear my in a fro or a puff. A detangling/conditioner spray is a must have along with curling cream and a lil bit of oil. I usually just twist my hair down at night & undo it in the am.
2683 2018-02-22 18:20:23 I have to get my oil changed by myself and I’m really nervous because I’m a dumb bitch that doesn’t know anything about cars and they scare me into spending more money  please send help.
2684 2018-02-22 18:20:11 This oil change was long over do.
2685 2018-02-22 18:20:06 According to the @EPA , recycling one ton of #aluminum cans saves the energy equivalent of 36 barrels of #oil or 14,000 kWh of #energy or 10 cubic yards of #landfill space. One small act can help do so much good! #Recycle what you can, when you can.

2692 2018-02-22 18:18:47 Would getting the oil flowing from Alberta through the pipeline expansion not solve the Alberta corking of BC wine, lets grow up and get out of the sandbox and start making fundamental economic decisions that help all Canadians!

2696 2018-02-22 18:18:29 I know there was an article floating a few years ago about homosexuality in sufi poems - please share if you know.

2702 2018-02-22 18:18:02 But surely OPEC/EIA sunlit uplands of rising product demand drives the market? Why then would higher crude oil prices cut refining margins? #OOTT

Oh yeah, this is gonna suck. lol

2709 2018-02-22 18:16:59 We just don’t have this same bedbug. Oil and gas lobbying is so strong here that you see exactly this tactic: a govt creating phantoms to fight, actively blocking progress and looking everywhere except at the clear and obvious solutions.
2710 2018-02-22 18:16:54 Too many of "our" reps in DC protecting industries - the firearm industry, the healthcare industry, the oil industry, the tobacco industry, etc., not enough protecting us

2726 2018-02-22 18:14:48 For making soap, ..oil is required. But to clean oil, ..soap is required.  This is the irony of life.
2727 2018-02-22 18:14:43 The warning should not be limited to the lowlife #TPLF #mafia. We must challenge foreign governments & businesses that oil TPLF's killing & torturing machines to advance shortsighted political & economic profit at our expense. Do not use taxpayers money to entrench dictatorship!

2731 2018-02-22 18:14:13 Let me ask them. @AsiyaKyari @ameenah_taheer is it true?
2732 2018-02-22 18:14:05 Note to self: don’t point out the character flaws of “Get Rich in Real Estate” founders. Adherents are more passionate than an essential oil vendor at a Sceintology convention.
2733 2018-02-22 18:13:52 Serene. My grandfather painted landscape oil paintings like these
2734 2018-02-22 18:13:42 Oil pipelines are related to dinosaurs like Trudeau and Notley...not to climate change leaders or people demanding hope for a future livable planet!
2735 2018-02-22 18:13:35 1. Preheat oven to 220C/200C fan forced.
Line 2 baking trays with baking paper.
Place the wonton wrappers on prepared trays. Spray with oil. Season. Bake, turning halfway through cooking, for 5-6 minutes or until golden and crisp. #foodiethursday
2736 2018-02-22 18:13:25 Additionally we see how the greater powers deal with societies that have the tiniest bit of oil in their possession. Pffft! I was immediately concerned for JA when I heard the oil news.

2751 2018-02-22 18:10:43 Jim, your data is accurate and I agree that Indians will find it very hard (culturally) to remove dairy. This is true. But, the "international" hype that dairy boards sell producers is slick snake oil. There's no guarantee of this. Markets are built on domestic consumption.
2752 2018-02-22 18:10:38 Omg I love Argan oil!

2779 2018-02-22 18:07:19 Elon Musk and others are creating electric cars. We can move away from oil, drilling in national parks, etc., and use new, cleaner technologies. The oil barons will need to figure out to adjust.
2780 2018-02-22 18:07:18 Maybe oil or something. Or he's a momentum player.... But he just compared bonds denominated in different currencies.

2786 2018-02-22 18:06:27 And Lord knows Big Oil is all about saving consumers money, right? How many fish/birds have died in cornfield spills?

A soothing bath salt, lavender bubble bath, and a relaxing bath oil. She also set out a few scented candles before-
2791 2018-02-22 18:05:49 She’s pretty sensitive and not really serious but that’s all of them anyway.
2792 2018-02-22 18:05:47 Ignore everything and focus on Oil
2793 2018-02-22 18:05:12 It's better than taking meds. I smoked cbd or thc oil some nights when I couldnt sleep. I get bad muscle spasms at night and I will take three hits from my pen and they go away immediately. Nothing wrong with it if she needs to sleep or relax

2801 2018-02-22 18:03:17 Maintindihan ba ito ng ordinaryong working citizen ng bansa natin? For filipino consumers weaker peso means rising prices, mataas na presyo for oil/gasoline, food, commodities, and other goods and services that impact their cost of living.
2802 2018-02-22 18:03:10 This may sound whacky. But I guarantee if you try CBD oil, it will help. They make it strong enough to take the pain of AIDS and late stage cancer. Not sure if you've tried. I've spoken to people who described their pain like you do. It helped alot. Also helps with sleep. :)
2803 2018-02-22 18:03:01 Bestowed by god, my ass...this man is a sacrilegious dunce who doesn’t give a damn about other Americans unless they fit into his notion of what that is. A complete fake, demagogue,  and snake oil salesman.

2911 2018-02-22 17:49:39 You know ya house hot when ya coconut oil is a liquid.
2912 2018-02-22 17:49:38 Omg don’t tell me that  lol ima have to get Castor oil and smother my eyeballs in it haha

2916 2018-02-22 17:49:08 “Wayne LaPierre” sounds like the name of a villain in a 90s stoner comedy where kids have to save their ski resort from an evil oil tycoon. 
In reality kids need to save their country from an evil gun huckster. So I guess it fits?
2917 2018-02-22 17:49:02 Im still out getting a oil change lol i cant just sit in the house all day . The roads not as bad as it was yesterday

2919 2018-02-22 17:48:42 Oh, bother. Have you tried hair oil? My hair’s pretty coarse and it’s done wonders for it.
2920 2018-02-22 17:48:33 Out of recession, into recovery. Go us. Lower oil prices, less foreign trade, and an increase in public spending is really making an impact. There’s no rush to increase interest rates because things will get wild. How long will it last? #squatrecovery
2921 2018-02-22 17:48:26 Why is getting your oil changed by yourself the most awkward thing ever
2922 2018-02-22 17:48:08 Oil analyst 
2923 2018-02-22 17:48:02 I wouldn’t know. I’m not a member. But still, I think you should do what I said please.

2927 2018-02-22 17:47:35 I use rose essential oil in it and it’s my favourite scent
2928 2018-02-22 17:47:28 prolly should be carful. even tho btc is itself the subject of many govt. machinations, one would be wise not to attempt things that are of themselves currently illegal.  even tho i think that mary u. anna should be legal and hemp oil. but thats another discussion
2929 2018-02-22 17:47:20 The butter has little protein on it so it can help ya for hunger . And the coconut oil helps ya to get energized. But is also helps ya out to clean out of your stomach like maybe you have some little fungus on your inner body.
2930 2018-02-22 17:47:02 In order to understand, instead of attack the government of Venezuela is necessary to accept the negative impact in it’s economy of the international oil prices. Venezuela oil dependent economy was unable to avoid this economic change social implications

2935 2018-02-22 17:46:26 Time for a oil change
2936 2018-02-22 17:46:13 @Boilerjuice very disappointing service. Oil delivery ordered, paid for on 3 Feb. Expected latest 15th, still waiting. Called to explain out of oil no one called back. Latest update delivery next Monday  #rubbish

2938 2018-02-22 17:45:59 The US warned Japan & gave notice that it should surrender or a very bad thing was on the way. Something the Japanese failed to do before attacking us.
2939 2018-02-22 17:45:56 This is so grotesque. The problem we’re facing is that there are no solutions for the evil within mankind. You can’t legislate away human nature. But we can take steps to mitigate it. Taking away the rights of individuals is not how we do that.

2941 2018-02-22 17:45:53 Yeah girl idk if it was the way that i removes them or if they weren’t completely ready to come out but i used oil and now I have bald ass eyes lmao
2942 2018-02-22 17:45:51 Dude there’s another way for this . You can mixed butter and coconut oil on the blander and you have a special diet-v-.
2943 2018-02-22 17:45:29 Venezuela was not just about an oil slump the gov overspent in the good times and took no action to mitigate a drop in oil prices. They failed thier plp.
2944 2018-02-22 17:45:28 when it comes to pointing out the folly of greed, and the destruction it causes? I don't think that's insensitive at all. Greed is the foundation for most abuses in society, whether its the greed of slave owners or the greed of oil corporations IMHO.
2945 2018-02-22 17:45:09 Drove to oil change place, got oil change, drove back to work all on my hour lunch. Let’s. Go.

2947 2018-02-22 17:45:04 I feel morally obligated to detail my car before dropping it off at the dealership  hence the reason I hate oil changes or any other maintenance

2949 2018-02-22 17:44:32 You inspired me to get Invisalign’s last year and now I’m convinced it’s for life  Expert tip, new trays just before bed + a few drops of CBD oil
2950 2018-02-22 17:44:25 Can you name a country that we destroyed and took their oil????

2953 2018-02-22 17:44:11 If we want to make Pulaski County High School truly safe for students, we should drill an oil well in the courtyard. Then every branch of gov’t would be here to “secure our interests.”
2954 2018-02-22 17:43:47 There was a great article that came out when Thatcher died about how writing hagiographies for certain people is a dangerous thing to do. I wish I could find that article and apply it to the praising of snake oil kingpin Billy Graham.

2959 2018-02-22 17:43:23 I just want a damn oil diffuser 
2960 2018-02-22 17:43:22 I've tried to wash the new hands, but I didn't use soap because I've heard that oil and stuff like that can damage resin... Maybe the chalky feel will go away after a while, idk. i might decide to go ahead and put the hands on today.

Thank you for the reply! 
2961 2018-02-22 17:43:21 What about things behind US elected officials? All legal? If so, whom? At least there is Oil to back the #Crypto  . What backs the USD? No fan of #Politricks but if You're trying to see, open all if you're eyes. Salute

2970 2018-02-22 17:42:22 Venezuela seems to be the newfound favorite of conservatives everywhere. It's as if all around mismanagement, and pegging your economy to the oil industry had nothing to do with capitalism. #SoWeird

2978 2018-02-22 17:41:55 Thank you for the work you have done while in office. You stood strong and achieved getting help to Georgians that needed it.

2993 2018-02-22 17:40:24 I am not sure the long term benefits of having oil. Poor leader of many countries with oil has not given long term benefits.
Look at Nigeria and Venezuela to name a few.

Plus we don't have the engineering capabilities to gain max benefits from the product.

3016 2018-02-22 17:38:05 cold war was a sarcastic comment. my use of the word crusade wasn't in reference to medieval military expeditions. more the wests crusade to control all the world's oil reserves by installing certain dictators, setting up cartels, then overthrowing regimes when they see fit.

3059 2018-02-22 17:34:07 Always remember people, that processing photos and sound is almost the only thing AI is good at, and most other promises are just snake oil.
3060 2018-02-22 17:34:04 
3061 2018-02-22 17:34:02 I totally agree, it’s absolutely insane! It’ like pouring oil on to a fire to extinguish it!!!
3062 2018-02-22 17:33:59 Chemical Oil Refining  I don’t understand anything 
3063 2018-02-22 17:33:54 So anyway the doc says the reason I’m still shedding skin is that I fried my nerve tips, and apparently fried nerve tips don’t signal the glands to produce oil. Whoda thunk.
3064 2018-02-22 17:33:16 What’s warranty   I been fucked over mines and the dealer probably be mad when I go for my oil change
3065 2018-02-22 17:33:13 I romanticize oil spills. It's just a fact. I CANT HELP IT
3066 2018-02-22 17:33:11 Life Tip: Always keep the correct oil and coolant in your car at all times. Google/YouTube how to fill up each, especially since we’re about to get into hot weather. 
3067 2018-02-22 17:33:09 this oil fr gets me fuuuuuuckerd up
3068 2018-02-22 17:33:04 ไม่แฟร์จิงค่ะ ไม่ชอบให้มีการรันคิวแบบนี้เลย
3069 2018-02-22 17:33:01 I feel good doing good.
3070 2018-02-22 17:32:58 We don’t have a defense budget, cause we don’t have-need an army, and I assure you it’s pretty free down here, and not because of the US and it’s world police complex. That “tyranny” is called something else outside the US, oil...
3071 2018-02-22 17:32:46 We have a Democratic Party member in the southern part of the county who  freaks out over fracking. He cites the film "Gasland" as proof of its danger. Water is indeed a major concern here, and it's far more precious than oil or gas, but I want real data instead of hysteria.
3072 2018-02-22 17:32:42 Loesch is a vile, self-serving, snake oil saleswoman. Just out to make a buck and suck in the Trump Gullibles
3073 2018-02-22 17:32:24 And he also praise Kenya for the oil pipeline project too mr president!!!
3074 2018-02-22 17:32:21 Refine and use it in Canada. Why are we importing oil?
3075 2018-02-22 17:32:02 The government takes your kids, that just wanted a college education,  and couldn’t afford one so they joined the National Guard, Army, Navy, Marine, Air Force reserves, train them to kill and send them out to fight oil wars for their corporate owners! A generation without PTSD?
3076 2018-02-22 17:31:58 I’ve been putting tea tree oil on it since it popped up late night Ima make it work tho
3077 2018-02-22 17:31:46 Parsley Energy shares soar as Austin oil driller beats Wall Street estimates
3078 2018-02-22 17:31:34 I ended buying loads of different ones - if you have a look on their website you can see the whole range - particular stand outs are the natural moisturising factor, the silicone primer, caffeine, the rose hip oil....it’s so inexpensive you can experiment
3079 2018-02-22 17:31:31 Love to start my day by crying and then burning myself with hot oil
3080 2018-02-22 17:31:30 Hall week dey come, your MCM dey rub castor oil for ein face gidigidi.
3081 2018-02-22 17:31:25 AND they're elected MPs, so not really doing anything wrong. At least no more wrong than any other MP claiming for duck houses or heating oil for stables
3082 2018-02-22 17:31:17 Anyone who changed their own oil or wash their car or needs tools hit ya boy up for that discount
3083 2018-02-22 17:31:06 Same, and I'm already drinking lots of water. My sister suggested putting tea tree oil on them, it's helping the smallest bit but I want to see immediate results. 
3084 2018-02-22 17:31:03 That deep feeling of pain when you realise your coconut oil is finished 
3085 2018-02-22 17:30:55 No data, but an important note that Hemp oil and CBD oil are different. Most Hemp oils will try to vaguely claim the same benefits of CBD.

Hemp is much cheaper and is primarily for dietary use.

@bengreenfield is big on CBD oils and has a few podcasts highlighting them.
3086 2018-02-22 17:30:55 Of course my car has to take the most expensive oil out there
3087 2018-02-22 17:30:54 My laugh for the day. Slush fund or flush fund? No record to judge risk. Hmmm but ethical Hmm like 'ethical oil and tobacco?

3091 2018-02-22 17:30:17 Millions of alternatives found in proper shops and then perfected in our kitchens! Let's start cooking again with olive oil, salt and lemon!
3092 2018-02-22 17:29:57 Does cooking with coconut oil give the taste of coconut  i really hate the taste of coconut
3093 2018-02-22 17:29:13 I used rose hip oil and didn’t get not one.

3096 2018-02-22 17:28:33 In addition the government takes things away all the time. Even when law abiding like your land to build a wall, lay an oil pipeline, a railroad. Not for the real worth of the home. If your dog bites a person it's taken away even if that dog brings you the pursuit of happiness.
3097 2018-02-22 17:28:31 How is your workout going on
3098 2018-02-22 17:28:26 But doesn't oil pipelines/construction emit more than trucks? Doesn't say how many trucks are hybrids or even electric.
3099 2018-02-22 17:28:25 How much for a 10w-30 oil change that must be completed by three o clock!

3104 2018-02-22 17:27:46 THE ULTIMATE MASSAGE OIL 
To create your CBD infused massage oil, you’ll need the following~

- 10 drops of geranium oil
- 2 tablespoons of jojoba oil
- 10 drops of essential oil, such as lavender, eucalyptus, orange or peppermint
-  Your desired amount of CBD Oil

3107 2018-02-22 17:27:29 What is going on in Seria? The UN can't do F all, the Kuwaites are one of the world biggest abusers of human rights, the US, UK and others have caused upset in the Middle East for oil and control, Russia is also involved we will not fight a world war again people so think hard
3108 2018-02-22 17:27:11 It's a hard transition. Your scalp over produces oil to make up for taking so much away every day. It takes time for it to realize you're going to stop stripping out the natural oil. It could take a month. Maybe a few. It's subjective
3109 2018-02-22 17:27:02 anyone else starting to wonder where the bar is set for this mythical “elite” status?

so far i’ve got “chews with mouth closed”.

snake oil
3110 2018-02-22 17:27:00 When you FT your papa in the hospital bed and he tha first thing he ask is,”Did you check the oil in your car?” Gotta love his old Italian ass!!!
3111 2018-02-22 17:26:59 PSA:
just because the oil isn't as stable as glass and shatter like ice doesn't not mean it's low quality. Stability is barely taken into account for all around quality of the product. LEARN FOOLS

3151 2018-02-22 17:21:58 I problem in PA was the 1000's of little oil wells that were tapped out over a century ago.  Never capped properly, holes in the areas thought to be solid, ground shifts, old empty wells now contaminating groundwater.
3152 2018-02-22 17:21:13 Then we could actually say, who’s the best player in the Oil after CMD, answer, nobody

3218 2018-02-22 17:13:55 I strongly disagree - for any plausible path to a stable climate, reducing oil use is required. Reforestation and ecosystem management are not transport. They are needed in addition to, not instead of, reduction in transport-related CO2.

3384 2018-02-22 16:54:02 Oddly the economic problems of the 70's, were a reverse of today's Venezuela. - i.e - If oil prices rise, the economy of the country which imports oil will suffer badly. - If however oil prices fall significantly, - the economy of the country that exports oil will suffer. -

3387 2018-02-22 16:53:34 I'm not engineer or whatever but in order for Jamaica to extract oil it will have to depend on external companies/countries. Oil extraction technology is extremely expensive and I'm sure developers keep their technology close to their chest.

3402 2018-02-22 16:51:33 Skin can become oily/ breakout with a new product- within 30 days this should settle. Recover contains oils/ceramide  to nourish skin- this may also account for some oiliness. Reduce the amount applied and see if this helps. A  glycolic acid product would help reduce oil too.

3412 2018-02-22 16:49:48 Government was wise to not let the oil benefit pass to the people but given the disadvantages that the government started at I would say they have done a good job though below expectations.

3414 2018-02-22 16:49:34 It can be bought legally ..cannabis oil...from Holland and Baratt, I believe..but it would be nice to have it licensed and prescribed.

3416 2018-02-22 16:49:17 No.  Depends on RR's, change in entire oil complex, not just crude, and adjustment factors.  People make too much of weekly data.  As well, demand has been above norm, so even if true, likely a reversion to mean, if even that.

3449 2018-02-22 16:44:02 1) Tarsands oil is dirty: low quality, hard & polluting to extract. Saudi oil is oil, not bitumen.
2) I'm as oil-independent as possible: never owned a car, hydroelectric heat.
3) Ontario electricity is expensive for political reasons, not bc renewables aren't getting cheaper.

3479 2018-02-22 16:41:25 I understand that it's just that I trust Everytown for gun statistics like I trust BP for oil spill research.

3484 2018-02-22 16:41:16 I had a flashback but don’t wanna get killed. That oil almost had me in trouble last night man.
3485 2018-02-22 16:41:16 Yes. Almost every non-desi economist ( desi economists have political axes to grind ) agrees macroeconomic stability is much better now. But @gossipdatabase will say it's all due to oil.  Fact is oil is only one part of the reason
3486 2018-02-22 16:41:02 Same with peak oil in the 1980s.
3487 2018-02-22 16:40:58 So last night I took a bunch of CBD oil and that's all I remember 
3488 2018-02-22 16:40:50 US oil inventories fell last week, snapping a 3 week advance, but what I  was most amazed by was the oil exports.  They rose 55% last week to  2.04 mln barrels.  Wow.  Second largest since EIA data began in 1993.    #wow

3497 2018-02-22 16:40:14 Okay okay, then I was going to recommend sunflower butter but it also uses oil, vegtable oil, to make spreading easier. If I find anything I'll share it with you. Keep on trucking Steph.

3499 2018-02-22 16:40:09 Huge week-on-week movement on EIA crude imports and exports:
-- Imports down 867k b/d from previous week
-- Exports up 722k b/d from previous week 
If you add both week-on-week changes, it equals to more than 11 million barrels over a 7-day period. #OOTT #oil #shale @TheTerminal

3526 2018-02-22 16:36:15 Was your business affected by the oil spill? Owners should have their business analyzed to determine if they are entitled to recompense.
3527 2018-02-22 16:36:09 Exodus 30-22-24 How to make the Holy oil. "Messiah" means "anointed one". "Christ" is a Greek term meaning "The anointed one". There were no last names then so Jesus Christ should be Jesus the Christ. The Primary Christian Faith.
3528 2018-02-22 16:36:08 The uncontrolled growth in oilsands production has displaced AB grain shipments, passenger rail, gutted the non-resource economy, led to typical Dutch Disease social ills.

Continuing the unbridled expansion of oil production via the use of pipelines will only increase problems
3529 2018-02-22 16:35:50 Actually it may have literal “roots”  Grafting of olive trees is how olive trees were cultivated in the ancient past.  Olive oil was a commodity.  A literal olive branch from a good tree would be a tremendous gift and peace offering.
3530 2018-02-22 16:35:49 Americans don't mean oil pipelines when they say infrastructure. Call out conservative greed.
3531 2018-02-22 16:35:45 Put oil on damp hair, but it doesn’t have to be clean. Let it sit in your hair for a minimum of 30 min (I sometimes leave mine over night) then rinse out.

It smells so good that you could sleep in the car

But that fresh fart smell doesn’t last long homie. And that fart isn’t going to drive the car or change the oil

That’s what discipline is for
3538 2018-02-22 16:35:23 For what? Is there gold, platinum, oil, gas, diamonds in that place?
3539 2018-02-22 16:35:17 We need a legislature and leadership that works for the working class, and not the rich, corporate, vested interests like oil, gas, mining, ranching, nukes, etc.

3548 2018-02-22 16:34:38 Nope. I was against the war, too. Roughly ninety percent of that stuff would have been "No war for oil!" Or "Wants revenge for his daddy."

3551 2018-02-22 16:34:31 It was always due to go back in after 1000 miles to have oil change following the camshaft replacement, but it’s got a noisy belt tensioner and been having problems with an “underboosting Turbo”...

3572 2018-02-22 16:32:15 Of course he did, he’s lobbying for the sale of more weapons. It’s his job. But it’s our job not to fall for the snake oil sales pitch. It’s not a solution, it’s a business model!

3761 2018-02-22 16:15:46 The US hasn't stopped interfering and attempting control of that oil since the 1940's, with constant subversions, propaganda campaigns and violence. Same as with all of Latin America. Get the US out of Central and South America and they'll restore democracy.

3771 2018-02-22 16:14:39 Last time I used tea tree oil. Worked out quite well for me 
3772 2018-02-22 16:14:37 I do it, not because of flavor or sticky noodles, but because of the different density. oil is less dense than water, so it floats above and reduces starch foam (of the boiling water). only a few drops are enough...
And the spoon thing, thats a myth... 
3773 2018-02-22 16:14:26 Lol hold up. You forgetting oil prices are down? Who wants to spend $80 a barrel to sell at $55 on the market

3899 2018-02-22 16:02:15 This confirms my theory that POL specialists makes it nearly impossible to acquire oil as a concerted effort to undermine the war machine and not because they're lazy and don't want to fill out paperwork.

3941 2018-02-22 15:59:21 The UAE's success partly comes from its use of indentured labour, and it being rich before oil being found in Dubai. Resources don't make a country rich. Guyana and many African countries have oil and minerals, and are still poor because of dependence on foreign capital.

3943 2018-02-22 15:59:15 Alicia Silverstone gained five pounds before her Batman movie and needed someone to oil her down to help her fit into her costume. And I've always thought, "Someone got paid Union wages for that."
3944 2018-02-22 15:59:15 Also she is ignoring climate change, indigenous communities, environmental damage, economic damage, political damage, all to protect oil interests. Her willingness to ignore science to protect oil interests is incredibly short sighted & not the sign of a progressive leader.
3945 2018-02-22 15:59:10 Kapag oily ba yung mukha ko, ang tawag virgin oil? Kasi virgin, referencing to me, tapos oily face. So yung oil na lumalabas sa mukha ko is virgin oil.

3962 2018-02-22 15:57:01 Yeah, like the studies that said man is warming the Earth, or cooling the Earth, or that we'd run out of oil by the 80's? Bought and paid for like the Trump Dossier.
3963 2018-02-22 15:56:59 How much water will be polluted by all that fracking? How many people will get sick from that polluted water? We shouldn’t be dependent on oil at all. We can and should do better.

4028 2018-02-22 15:50:24 Hoooomigosh, the Archer Farms croissants are so bad. They're like raw flour and vegetable oil, pressed into a croissant shape. Upsetting.
4029 2018-02-22 15:50:22 Jason and the argan oil + jungle. Hair happier than ever and no landfill. Yay! 
4030 2018-02-22 15:50:21 @1a is he seriously presenting moving green electricity as how more difficult or taxing than a oil pipeline? That is absolutely unfathomable to me. Who buys this crap?
4031 2018-02-22 15:50:20 “hahax practice reunion feast sia ! first buy (egg flour chicken fish salt oil beef) seconf buy beer hahax then can drunk sia ! #fun #happy “
4032 2018-02-22 15:50:12 only i could let the oil burn my arm last night when making dippy fried egg butties so skincerity on it today
4033 2018-02-22 15:50:11 Sometimes -- and hear me out -- I do not read everything trending on Twitter.
4034 2018-02-22 15:50:08 This bitch really just put on essential oil/perfume IN CLASS like okay cool we ALL wanted to choke on it that’s neato my guy

4039 2018-02-22 15:49:54 I live in NY so I doubt this will happen but look how the snake oil salesmen flipped the conversation from banning AR-15’s to arming teachers. The day they start doing that is the day I quit teaching.

4042 2018-02-22 15:49:32 If you can’t wait that long and want to get paid to wait than you should buy $CJ.TO It pays a very safe 10% yield and this dividend is secure even if oil goes down to $50.
4043 2018-02-22 15:49:30 Coconut oil for some nice smelling lube as well. Black satin sheets. A fan on low setting, ropes. A whole orgasm
4044 2018-02-22 15:49:28 I need to start couponing saving hella money on this oil change boiii
4045 2018-02-22 15:49:21 Or how concerned they are about women. It's only how they can use women for their political goals.
4046 2018-02-22 15:49:18 Okonjo Iweala as Finance minister depleted our foreign reserves from over $64 to less than $30B as at May 29th, 2015. in spite of the over 4-yr period of oil windfall witnessed by that regime. So, u and ur likes can continue to insult Northerners as illiterates.
4047 2018-02-22 15:49:16 oh!イル
4048 2018-02-22 15:48:55 Don't want to splurge on oil blotting sheets? Take a thin toilet-paper square and use it to blot excess oil on your T-zone.
4049 2018-02-22 15:48:38 Veterans know this: proficiency in firearms does NOT equate to proficiency in combat. Teachers chose a profession of pacifism and education. This is oil and vinegar.
4050 2018-02-22 15:48:35 I get it. So eerily similar now vs. your oil trade above. I may try to lookup the oil chart after 7/11/2014. :-)

4053 2018-02-22 15:48:28 I invest so much time in skin care, I really see the results now. I tried almost every skin care product and nothing helped, little apple cider vinegar, honey, oil toner, baking soda, oatmeal and lemon juice does wonders
4054 2018-02-22 15:48:17 'In a moving system like the Hudson, cleanup of an oil spill is next to impossible' – Riverkeeper's Capt. Lipscomb on @NBCNewYork onhttps://www.nbcnewyork.com/on-air/as-seen-on/Crude-Oil-Trains-Spark-Derailment-Fears-in-NJ_New-York-474773063.html #HudsonRiver

4059 2018-02-22 15:47:42 New windshield wipers, bout to get an oil change, then new tires. My white girl gonna be lookin and feelin TOO GOOD
4060 2018-02-22 15:47:37 NRA CEO Wayne LaPiere reminds #CPAC audience that “The only solution to a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.” 
Read: Gun manufacturers want to sell 2 guns.
Like the snake oil salesmen who sells you poison, but conveniently has the antidote to sell you. #FollowTheMoney
4061 2018-02-22 15:47:34 This one that you’re shaking your head will you buy the castor oil for me? 
4062 2018-02-22 15:47:22 Now we’re cooking with peanut oil
4063 2018-02-22 15:47:21 Just found out I have to pull my trucks cab off to replace the high pressure oil pump....that’s just great....so great....

4064 2018-02-22 15:47:13 I put coconut oil in my hair last night and my hair feels amazing.... 
4065 2018-02-22 15:46:50 I guess shit-posting engineers in Bumfuck, NC read about NRA billboards?

(I have a very full plate of news to consume, mostly not gun-related.)
4066 2018-02-22 15:46:43 Up early getting this oil changed 
4067 2018-02-22 15:46:32 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
4068 2018-02-22 15:46:24 全力で殴りたい(´◉ω◉)
4069 2018-02-22 15:46:04 @russellgold  and @MichaelEWebber , there is a $37 difference between your predictions in the oil price pool.
4070 2018-02-22 15:45:42 We put out black oil sunflower seed for the birds. The deer eat from the feeder, too. I know feeding deer improperly can be a big problem for them, especially in winter. Suspect small quantities in bird feeders is not a problem, but lots of contradictory info online. Anyone know?
4071 2018-02-22 15:45:31 Bloomberg: "U.S. #Oil Boom Tempts #Saudis to Consider American Crude Sale." ^@business
4072 2018-02-22 15:45:21 Civil discourse is dead on the left.  Pathetic.
4073 2018-02-22 15:45:21 Same distinction existed for many years between Russia (top producer) and Saudi Arabia (top exporter). Depending on success of Saudi strategy to wean itself from oil, the situation may continue... Then again, it may not (e.g., Saudi domestic demand = ??)
4074 2018-02-22 15:45:11 And olive oil!! Heat it up a bit and you can even put it in your hair lol
4075 2018-02-22 15:45:08 I use coffee grounds + a lil bit of coconut oil :-)
4076 2018-02-22 15:45:05 "Why does it smell like marshmallows in here? It's probably Brandon's Vape oil!"

4079 2018-02-22 15:44:53 Do you have olive oil? You could purée in olive oil, freeze in ice cube tray. Or chop it and put it in a glass jar in the freezer for a little while. Do you like salsa? You could make a vat of salsa.
4080 2018-02-22 15:44:49 all white girls do is smoke cigarettes and skip their oil changes
4081 2018-02-22 15:44:45 OIL 15min chart VERY over extended up, all indicators higher exhaussted, #WATCH closely for confirmation lower and a move to begin 2nd leg lower from daily chart. DWT ?
4082 2018-02-22 15:44:44 Girl, let's talk about love
4083 2018-02-22 15:44:30 I’m like fighting with splattering oil 
4084 2018-02-22 15:44:28 I have oil you can put on them to help grow thick eyebrows
4085 2018-02-22 15:44:27 You probably don't know this, because it seems you don't know much.  But the majority of crude oil leaked into the ocean along our coasts, comes from cracks in the earth.  Look it up.
4086 2018-02-22 15:44:08 tea tree oil should fix that right up! if u dab some on a qtip and put it on the keloid every morning and night after u wash ur face it should shrink day by day
4087 2018-02-22 15:44:05 That poor kid in need of cannabis oil, his survival remains woefully low too 
4088 2018-02-22 15:43:46 Looks fantastic @alex_waller @tomwood678 how many coats of oil would you put on a bare slab like that?
4089 2018-02-22 15:43:28 They are like water and oil their situation is complicated #bbnaija
4090 2018-02-22 15:43:26 Now comes the #Petro-Gold (petro-oro) as announced by Maduro... really really bizarre all this.. #oott #venezuela #gold #oil
4091 2018-02-22 15:43:14 Well, THAT won't get ignored. Host would pretend to  have a heart attack.
4092 2018-02-22 15:43:13 Dana was composed and ready to debate, but the Left prefers to hurl insults. Hopefully this little creep will grow up and learn how to act.
4093 2018-02-22 15:43:12 Watching Wayne Lapierre of the NRA. Use the same speech patterns as Trump. Start responsible, tell how he had the idea years ago, start appealing to your fears and then telling you are afraid and that everyone but him is out to get you , he alone can save you. Snake oil sales

4097 2018-02-22 15:42:47 @McDonaldsCorp @McDonalds Allergy help! Does Shamrock Shake contain Peppermint Oil in syrup?!?! Thx!
4098 2018-02-22 15:42:41 And that box be slippery like trying to walk on oil
4099 2018-02-22 15:42:33 How does oil pulling and salt water help?
4100 2018-02-22 15:42:18 @Hanseizuremum good luck !  I hope that you are able to obtain and use cannabis oil anyway.  This government are not credible, you won’t get arrested, I’d love to see them try.....
4101 2018-02-22 15:42:14 If you let the oil settle for several weeks and let the C60 fall out of the mixture, you can wash the C60 with alcohol, weigh and determine what percentage has dissolved.
4102 2018-02-22 15:42:07 Oil authority
4103 2018-02-22 15:41:59 @ABDanielleSmith it is sad that the PM is not taking a stronger stand on this issue.  You are right that we need more people from BC to get on board with the Kinder Morgan Pipeline, as a last resort we may have to limit gas and oil supply to BC to show oil is part of their lives
4104 2018-02-22 15:41:53 Iran supports Palestine with money and weapons. Saudi supports Israel with oil used to kill Palestinians and take over Al Quds.
4105 2018-02-22 15:41:46 Roast cubed new spuds and sliced onions with bay leaves, thyme, olive oil, seasoning 30 mins then mackerel fillets for 10 on top.  Serve with lemon wedges
4106 2018-02-22 15:41:42 The answer is not to poor more oil on the fire.  

He's a clown dressed as a president.
4107 2018-02-22 15:41:22 Inform yourself on CBD oil or vaping medicinal cannabis. Also consider ketamine.
4108 2018-02-22 15:41:15 Oil or alcohol
4109 2018-02-22 15:41:05 I am old enough to remember when a few targets in a campaign ad was the equivalent of murder.
4110 2018-02-22 15:41:02 They gotta get someone to pay for that oil, workers and pipelines. While the world moves away from dollar backed oil with Venezuela leading the charge. Now China is following up with there petrol-yuan. Russia's also closing in on there share of market. How long petrol/USD last?
4111 2018-02-22 15:41:01 @FUDDSWORLD this weekend going to do like 2 or 3 cans of tuna, mayo, sunflower seeds, olive oil, and pecans every day for meals, good or anything to add?
4112 2018-02-22 15:41:01 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
4113 2018-02-22 15:40:55 Just took my hair out of my bun & was like oh god what the fuck why is it so greasy, but then I remembered putting coconut oil in it last night & was somehow very relieved
4114 2018-02-22 15:40:54 CBD OIL IS IN STOCK
4115 2018-02-22 15:40:53 Lol yeah I used to have the same problem! Sometimes still. Make sure on wash days you pre-poo with an oil of some sort. I use coconut oil because it helps with detangling. When you put product in your hair, always end with some type of cream or butter to seal in the moisture.
4116 2018-02-22 15:40:50 Tell me, do I seem much younger than I am, with my fam for an oil change and they did an inspection XD.
4117 2018-02-22 15:40:33 I am working in Saudi Aramco ARBI we'll head platform as a Lead E & I Commisionoing Engineer.I am looking New  oil & Gas project in any of the rotation field as a Senior E & I Engineer.rkt8286@gmail.com
4118 2018-02-22 15:40:17 One of my favorite pieces I ever made is an oil painting, but it's so hard to get back into it without the access to a well-ventilated studio, oils, solvents, a separate set of brushes, etc. Maybe someday, when I'm rich! 
4119 2018-02-22 15:40:16 えるしっているか、遠藤氏は油しか飲まない。
4120 2018-02-22 15:40:15 There is an olive oil pairing app, and an olive oil bot that answers your questions... or how to waste time while you should be searching for thesis bibliography
4121 2018-02-22 15:40:11 The oil man just gave a girl a discount cause she was pretty then turned around and charged me full price damn bro it be like that  she’s not banging for oil change discounts ahah
4122 2018-02-22 15:40:06 On a side note, I do notice my beard blow up in fullness and health when I am eating properly. Less oil from skin transferred to hair and so on
4123 2018-02-22 15:39:58 Sandwich Special,The Italian.Salami,pepperoni,provolone cheese,lettuce,red onion,bell pepper,tomato,pepperoncini,oil&vinegar dressing,and Greek oregano.

4125 2018-02-22 15:39:53 Jamaican castor oil. Rub it on you scalp twice a week. Google it
4126 2018-02-22 15:39:49 The country was too reliant on the socialism model, which is fine as long as there's money to support it. Once the bottom dropped out of the oil market, however, the Venezuelen economy completely fell apart.

4128 2018-02-22 15:39:45 Best popcorn I ever had was made by a friend's Mom. She had a knack for the perfect pop time (pan on the stove with oil and lid) for fluffy popcorn then she'd butter it, use seasoned salt and Parmesan cheese toss it and it was like nacho cheese Doritos!
4129 2018-02-22 15:39:45 Looks oil Twitter has blocked me. Nothing I'm postings on feed.
4130 2018-02-22 15:39:30 Bilal ko koi oil pila dey shayed boltey huay phansa band kerdey.
4131 2018-02-22 15:39:11 Such as what? Oil price? Anything else?

So tell me why the populations of Norway and even Russia are not eating their pets?
4132 2018-02-22 15:39:01 going back to sleep and diffusing this fucking headache away with peppermint oil
4133 2018-02-22 15:38:51 Exactly.  They want to poor oil (guns) on the fire (mass killings).  Good idea..
4134 2018-02-22 15:38:36 I just burnt myself with hot oil about 6 separate times
4135 2018-02-22 15:38:27 After all the pumps finished at the 2017 Extravaganza and the Neck Oil was barrelled out to most brewers to cater for us drinkers when everyone else ran out, that soon became my favourite! @dannybish007 @southstand_86
4136 2018-02-22 15:38:09 Damn you got that baby oil poppin'! 
4137 2018-02-22 15:38:08 When you sit in the "quiet waiting room" while your car gets an oil change & a guy sits down to eat his breakfast & all you hear is his chewing with mouth open!  Ugggh! #misophonia #mannersplease
4138 2018-02-22 15:37:58 We'll replace Common Core with tests on how fast students can disassemble, reassemble, and oil their AR-15s.
4139 2018-02-22 15:37:54 thanks! it was part of my senior thesis. and I will say this, oil painting is NOT like riding a bicycle.  It's something I would love to get better at again when I have the spare time.
4140 2018-02-22 15:37:44 Coconut Oil is the bomb
4141 2018-02-22 15:37:38 Humutan lage kaayo ko sa efficascent oil 
4142 2018-02-22 15:37:34 What’s the difference between regular hair oils and beard oil? Other than finding oils that are also beneficial to your face?
4143 2018-02-22 15:37:23 Dunno what you're talking about with the billboard. Or violent rhetoric against NRA members. Are there cases of violent rhetoric against NRA members?
4144 2018-02-22 15:37:19 $oil markets $brent more bullish than crude oil
4145 2018-02-22 15:37:12 A look at lipidomics shows many oils to be main lipid sources for the body (we manufacture C60oo). But olive has a high content of MUFA's  particularly  octadecenoic or oleic acid. 
This means olive oil is the best delivery system b/c avocado oil etc do  not distribute as well.
4146 2018-02-22 15:37:06 こちらこそ反応ありがとうございますまだあまりお話しできていないのでイメージというかなんとなくですが
4147 2018-02-22 15:37:04 Tancho busuk kottt!!

4150 2018-02-22 15:36:34 If you ever get bored of tomato soup, make Salmorejo (a Spanish tomato puree). Easy, super quick, and filling. Tomato, salt, olive oil, bread, garlic in the blender and it's ready. Serve it chilled. I don't mind it at room temperature btw.
#cooking #vegetarian
4151 2018-02-22 15:36:31 This scented oil vaporizer legendary
4152 2018-02-22 15:36:29 I read that tweet as ppl wanting someone to respond to her with strong words, shut her down verbally, etc. But when ppl seemed I was endorsing a *literal* burning, of course I clarified and deleted my tweet. Not here to fan violence.
4153 2018-02-22 15:36:12 One tbsp of coconut oil in my coffee is the best thing I have tasted in coffee!!
4154 2018-02-22 15:36:07 Ain’t no slicking a can of oil around here..
4155 2018-02-22 15:36:05 The media corporations aren't any different than Big Pharma or the oil industry. In fact you could argue they're worse because they promote the agendas of all large corporations. 
Their objectivity is really just a veil to conceal the truth in the name of profits.
4156 2018-02-22 15:35:56 YES! So like if you do a balsamic salmon thing, it goes great on a salad of field greens with grape tomato and olives with oil and balsamic dressing
4157 2018-02-22 15:35:44 Finna have the oil and holy water like heavenly father I humbly come before you today 
4158 2018-02-22 15:35:40 holiday sched oil report at 11am ET. No ideas on that one.
4159 2018-02-22 15:35:38 Buffet owns the rails that transports Coal and Oil . So why would he fight agains a pipeline?
4160 2018-02-22 15:35:28 Yes, Justin's grandfather was successful -- wiki Pierre:  The family had become quite wealthy by the time Trudeau was in his teens, as his father sold his prosperous gas station business to Imperial Oil.[12]  Justin is  worth a modest $10 million now. Pierre didn't squander it.
4161 2018-02-22 15:35:10 Thanks for the info! I agree. Stock performance makes no sense. It’s one of the only oil stocks to be at a 52 week low as oil has continued higher.
4162 2018-02-22 15:35:05 Imma start doing break jobs and oil changes hmu!!!
4163 2018-02-22 15:35:04 Leaving Mosul and Raqqa nearly demolished, and declaring he won't rebuild it. Whilst also holding on Assad oil to get revenue to rebuild.

4168 2018-02-22 15:34:48 So Outside of the already established tourism.... we have oil, marijuana, and agriculture with potential for being major industries in Jamaica. 

And mi know we just ago siddung and stay poor same way...... 
4169 2018-02-22 15:34:47 You do realise there are men and women that dedicate their lives to make sure oil spills do not happen.  They make sure that the pipe used will not burst under pressure? Stop making it seem like its an everyday occurence

4174 2018-02-22 15:34:07 @NRA nobody wants to take away the 2nd Amendment from the Constitution that is BS of you selling snake oil like always 2 sell more guns.
4175 2018-02-22 15:34:02 Not alot of action today in the market. We should get a move soon with the data coming out on those oil and gas plays

4178 2018-02-22 15:33:55 From my understanding the oil’s supposed to help them retain flavor... I think you can freeze them without it but they still have to be chopped tho.

4191 2018-02-22 15:32:44 People are treating this oil thing like they found a massive reserve. It could really be 10 barrels down there

4194 2018-02-22 15:32:07 I have a bit of Ukaliptus oil which is very similar to olbus, both work wonders.
4195 2018-02-22 15:31:42 The thing is, aside from the overpowering smell, I really like the oil that I'm using. And the wax is crucial if I don't want to look like I've glued raccoon fur to my face.

4198 2018-02-22 15:31:29 The paralympics is a real interesting and entertaining experience.
It's also a bit of a challenge wank, so get the oil out.

4204 2018-02-22 15:30:55 marijuana has a lot in common with economics of nuclear. Both of them have an industry on top of them that tries to suppress them (oil,tobacco,) and both of them are arguably better alternatives in terms of health, but cost is driven up by unnecessary regulations.
4205 2018-02-22 15:30:53 Its playbook is to combine spreading propaganda with corrupting politics, which it shares with Koch Bros., oil and gas industry, and many others.

4214 2018-02-22 15:30:14 Crude Oil Inventories data out in 30 mins. Details of crude stockpiles often directly impact the price of oil at the time of its release as traders base their decisions on supply levels. The CAD exchange rate can also be indirectly affected by oil price.

4234 2018-02-22 15:27:41 I’m guessing his ability to pick up a drop of used oil, in the most lopsided of parts per million scenarios, rivals a sharks ability to pick up a drop of blood from miles away.

4244 2018-02-22 15:27:01 My guess is they will want to take a look at RNH on his wing. They know Draisaitl can play there and if the plan is to go out and get a winger to put there, may as well figure out what their options are in house. I prefer RNH down the middle.

4270 2018-02-22 15:24:06 I think it was just for 'public consumption'. Don't think they got capacity to influence Indian foreign policy. Heck, they can't even make India pay $18 billion that India owes them for oil imports

4272 2018-02-22 15:23:49 energy is not all oil and gas is used for. Our life are surrounded by oil and gas in almost everything we see. If you want to use solar or wind to power ur house so be it, but know that they aren't ready for large scale use and that you still need oil and gas to function.
4273 2018-02-22 15:23:47 What a BS article. Oil companies create jobs and Canada selling its natural resources pays for the public sector.

4307 2018-02-22 15:19:58 I don't watch CNN, but when I do, it's through the lens of my conservative twitter friends
4308 2018-02-22 15:19:49 Ironically, most current republicans want to use our own oil, but democrats won't let us so we have to get it from somewhere else.
4309 2018-02-22 15:19:45 I'm so in love with this argan oil! 
4310 2018-02-22 15:19:36 Castor oil smells nasty though
4311 2018-02-22 15:19:29 @JakesTakes speaking of your hair, I died laughing when @FOX32Scott talked about the oil spill when you jumped in the lake for the PP LOL

4313 2018-02-22 15:19:16 自分一人でじゃできないこと、わからないことが沢山ある。

だから聞く勇気と間違える勇気が必要だね。

今日は頭をとても使う日だったけど、とても有意義な議論や話ができたと思う。

4327 2018-02-22 15:17:39 @NRA @waynelapierrejr @realDonaldTrump What a double-talking snake oil salesman!! Local schools and police are strapped for dollars and do great jobs for the most part. We do not need more guns, we need more humanity at the NRA and White House! Guns are the evil among us!!

4331 2018-02-22 15:17:13 Her brain works just like Trump's. Always blame the other guy for what you are doing. She incites violence in her videos so we have to arm ourselves. It's all about the $$$$. Snake oil. Just like Trump.
4332 2018-02-22 15:17:07 Great people, like the white supremacists in Charlottesville. No, theyre now big oil, big tobacco, puppets 4 gun manufacturers who give no craps abt people & only care about their bottom dollar. @DLoesch proved it when she lied about the NRA support for expanded background checks
4333 2018-02-22 15:16:53 But it is not surprising after all this tieme of terror and leading shit hole countries in the WORLD into debt, bringing those nations to poverty!!!
Not to mention the multinational companies making use of natural resources like oil, or sand mines for instance!!!

4338 2018-02-22 15:16:40 It’s illegal to sell suntan oil until after noon on Sunday. (Provincetown, Massachusetts)
4339 2018-02-22 15:16:36 Subsidizing green energy is “funding” subsidizing oil companies are “kickbacks” that’s biased. Correct answer is government subsidizes no one!
4340 2018-02-22 15:16:27 Everybody talking about how they are loving the warm weather while I woke up this morning with enough oil on my face to run a car because it's above 65 degrees

4343 2018-02-22 15:16:16 For dry and damaged hair I recommend the bio oil. It controls for hair fall. For flaky scalp apply with a mix of sugar and massage into your hair and head to remove air flakes or dead skin cells and your head will be renewed. Leave it in for a few mins and rinse with warm water.
4344 2018-02-22 15:15:55 @NRA has been selling snake oil on the 2nd Amendment 2 sell more guns. Lafayette represents gun manufacturers sitting on gun stock piles.
4345 2018-02-22 15:15:47 I use organic green leaf lettuce, some iceberg lettuce, (sometimes Romaine lettuce too); carrots, cucumber, celery, (sometimes add Kale); chopped walnuts, Avacado slices, cranberries, and top with olive oil.  YUMMY!

As a nation we have become so focused on big $$ & the interest of lobbyists (gun, pharma, oil) that we are harming our own future - we will have many kids that will have to bear the brunt of our misdoings.

4374 2018-02-22 15:11:48 Kecenderungan ini dilihat dari sudut mana? 

Kalau dari banyaknya investor apakah by design atau karena zamannya?  Misalkan pada masa Suharto banyak investasi Amerika di oil and gas dan pertambangan.  Sementara pada masa Jokowi, China sedang ekspansi investasi keluar.

4376 2018-02-22 15:11:18 In Beirut, these last couple of days have been pretty crazy between Israel and gas and oil and just politics in general. Hopefully it calms down a little bit in the near future.
4377 2018-02-22 15:11:16 Unifor lobbies against oil and gas,  gave millions of workers dues to Trudeau to block pipelines and kill the oil sands.

4381 2018-02-22 15:10:46 We are breaking up from a small falling megaphone on the 1H which has me thinking a potential retest of 62.70s we go through 63s then I began second guessing on a lower low on oil. If we get the retest of high 62s it’s very important it holds.

Bro: I’m sure it’ll be fine. *dismisses my concern* You worry too much. 
Me this morning: Appt is at 1015. 
Bro: Are you crazy? Look at all the snow!

4403 2018-02-22 15:08:25 Yup, that's the reality. And that is exactly what technology adoption theory tells us will happen. Old tech rarely falls off a cliff, esp. if it fills a niche that allows it to compete against the emerging tech. One reason why oil will be around a very long time.

4439 2018-02-22 15:04:45 We understand completely. How ‘bout we don’t buy this bullsh*t from the snake oil salesman. The @NRA only care about selling more guns and can go f*ck themselves.
4440 2018-02-22 15:04:25 that is sad news indeed.  But for the shipping I would buy direct, so easy with @AmazonUK fullfillment, send over a crate & start selling!  You should know there are at least 2 sellers on Amazon UK that sell your Brain Octane oil at least, might be old stock as is old label .

4455 2018-02-22 15:02:25 awww thanks, it's easing slightly. take some paracetamols yourself, it might help. Also, if you can, get hold of some olbas oil and put some on the tissue and sniff it in, it'll clear that heady nosey feeling.
4456 2018-02-22 15:02:14 Always brine, no need to “beer can”. Get under the skin with oil and rub. Spatchcock if short on time. Skin won’t crisp much in smoker but can throw in oven at end to crisp it up

4468 2018-02-22 15:01:20 There are certainly those elements of the policy.  No argument here.  But you are missing important trade benefits. Lowers price of oil and we still import alot of oil, for example.

4470 2018-02-22 15:00:50 Most people who own kayaks have one for their whole family. A $10 tax on each would add up. Leave the environmentally friendly boats alone, no noise, no milfoil, no gas & oil.

4472 2018-02-22 15:00:33 Oil cleaning method, é basicamente passar óleo no rosto de acordo com as propriedades, é muito bom, sério mesmo
4473 2018-02-22 15:00:33 But It’s okay for them to be owned by Banks, Big Pharma, Oil, Big Chemical, Insurance Corps, Military Industrial Complex, Warlords, Foreign Royals(Dictators) etc.... these people are so hypocritical, that I can’t take them serious in the “Gun Debate”
4474 2018-02-22 15:00:32 Palm oil is used in 50% of snack foods. If you look on the ingredients label on snack foods, it will most likely contain palm oil. It is also used in many household cleaning products.

4494 2018-02-22 14:58:48 It is not about the sources you is about how you manage it a lot of countries have oil however they are considered poor countries
4495 2018-02-22 14:58:43 It is if they fry in vegetable oil instead of beef dripping.
4496 2018-02-22 14:58:41 Also they hate the smell of peppermint, so spray peppermint oil around any of the places they seem to be enjoying or coming from
4497 2018-02-22 14:58:25 Sy pon penah pakai bio oil dua botol tak hilang2. Last sy pki ubat herba rm5 je hilang terus parut tu. tapi org tu dh xjual dah 
4498 2018-02-22 14:58:15 Do you think that we should get rid of palm oil completely and replace it with a different oil, or continue to make it and make sustainable palm oil?
4499 2018-02-22 14:58:04 Even oil blessed Saudi Arabia is gradually phasing out subsides, how will this N800bn supplementary budget for oil marketers help us?

4507 2018-02-22 14:57:39 Sure, but it’s super expensive and time consuming way to buy a few extra hours compared to just frying in coconut oil. Plus, the shells will still be greasy from liquid oil.

4514 2018-02-22 14:56:48 What kind of things is palm oil used for? Is it put in our food? What are it’s purposes?
4515 2018-02-22 14:56:31 It's basically a powder that absorbs excess oil from your hair :)
4516 2018-02-22 14:56:18 Oh and also using as much coconut oil as you possibly can for everything
4517 2018-02-22 14:56:08 Oil companies face "ocean of liability" over their damage to environment, yet many of them are predicting peak oil is decades away, when surely the growth of renewables and electric vehicles belies this. @PRI_News @CarbonBubble @IIGCCnews @ShareActionUK @solarcity
4518 2018-02-22 14:56:06 Railways move oil to maximize profits....makes sense.
Moving oil is more profitable than moving grain.
Wheat Board made sure grain got enough rail cars....Harper , Kenney and the rest of them eliminated the Wheat Board.
It is a business decision for railways. PERIOD

4520 2018-02-22 14:55:33 Need to add cod liver oil to my stack again for my skin tings
4521 2018-02-22 14:55:31 I use them for everything but have only had problems with foundation (& now just wrap that pot in a tissue..all class) The stacky ones always snap I find. Do want a good way to transport oil in mini but think maybe the answer here is samples... ?
4522 2018-02-22 14:55:25 That’s why they’re trying to censor us on social media platforms.
4523 2018-02-22 14:55:23 หล่อมากกกกอ่ะ

4525 2018-02-22 14:55:06 He’ll continue to take money if they support his agenda; so I assume if he’ll not refuse money from the NRA, he won’t refuse money from David Duke, oil companies, anti-environmentalist groups etc.

4529 2018-02-22 14:54:43 - compared to lasering which removes the top layer of skin imm., the dark spot solution is gentler and longer lasting effects. Another product from Kiehl’s that’s great is the midnight recovery conc, helps with radiance, skin renewal. Oil based but for night use it’s alright.
4530 2018-02-22 14:54:39 On a far happier note, I put a new oil into my hair after I straightened it and IT IS SO SOFT.
4531 2018-02-22 14:54:26 That's why u day fresh d dat. Lol
4532 2018-02-22 14:54:18 So oil is more important than food. ..terrifying
4533 2018-02-22 14:54:08 That fire was too close to Oil Libya service station near the bridge, in this heat & no water. Bad combo 
4534 2018-02-22 14:53:47 Thank you for your replies however where does the demand for an oil for products & fuel come from? I don’t believe there is not an alternative for small scale farmers the demand has come from companies such as @Unilver in the first place.
4535 2018-02-22 14:53:42 My boyfriend is the biggest tight ass, hates spending money, but he listens to @PatMcAfeeShow everyday and now we’re getting a Leesa mattress and he’s getting some fish oil.. 
4536 2018-02-22 14:53:39 As we enter the second points race this Saturday at Volunteer Speedway, can’t say thanks enough to our great Iron-Man Series Sponsors: Schaeffer’s Oil, Brucebilt, Custom Suspension, DirtonDirt, AR Bodies, American Racer Tires & Hoosier Tires.
4537 2018-02-22 14:53:38 I'd second this. I add AVC and lemon essential oil to my morning water that I take to the gym and then also keep lemon EO here at my office so I can add it throughout the day as well.

4541 2018-02-22 14:53:22 and the refuse nut after the oil has been extracted by boiling,
4542 2018-02-22 14:53:01 Is the market paying attention to Parent-Child well degradation? PE pointed it out of the Permian & now a huge issue in the SCOOP/STACK.. this will negatively impact the magnitude of future oil production from shale.. #OOTT maybe shale isn’t what everyone is making it out to be.
4543 2018-02-22 14:52:47 Bones don’t turn to oil

4545 2018-02-22 14:52:18 with the rise of electric vehicles, the demand of gasoline and oil and the vehicles that run off it will one day eventually go down  #UCCEcon @Econ_Sport_Prof
4546 2018-02-22 14:52:17 ANYONE that invests in Venezuela's oil or gold backed ICO's is a  disgrace to humanity! You're extending a disgusting dictators reign  which will do NOTHING for the people there. They will continue to starve and be oppressed longer thanks to you.  #petro $PTR $BTC #fumaduro
4547 2018-02-22 14:52:10 Guess who has to pay for a new door handle, windshield wiper, windshield, and to get the oil changed all in the next two weeks?
4548 2018-02-22 14:52:09 palm oil ago add
4549 2018-02-22 14:51:34 So when I get my job
I'm gonna buy:
- a new phone with a case and warranty 
- my gaming setup (not like a dream build or anything more like 1,000 dollars worth of stuff)
Then after that I'm saving up my money to move out asap.
4550 2018-02-22 14:51:22 Reagan thinks my morning face routine is her face routine. She’s going to need her own sunshine oil and she’s butter 
4551 2018-02-22 14:51:21 Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and viewpoints. I respect that. To me, it’s insensitive to draw a comparison between slavery and this pipeline. Also it won’t slow down or speed up “global warming” and oil spill... ya maybe I guess. Don’t fly anywhere #planecrash

4562 2018-02-22 14:49:41 And for an oil change, just find any place that does them, pull your car up, and they will handle the rest. Just be prepared to wait a little bit. And call around to see where is cheapest. I use a Groupon for jiffy lube 
4563 2018-02-22 14:49:33 Go and add coconut oil

4568 2018-02-22 14:49:09 Actually, after having attended many back to school nights, it’s probably a bad idea to arm teachers, now that I think about it. I can’t picture any of my kid’s teachers handling a gun. It would be like mixing oil and water.
4569 2018-02-22 14:48:57 Pro Tip: If you store coconut oil into your kale, it makes it easier to scrape into the trash.

4593 2018-02-22 14:46:11 Rail isn't a safe way to transport crude oil.  We're getting to the point where we'll no longer need to depend on oil - but building new infrastructure to support new drilling won't help us get there.

Here in Canada, cream, cheese, butter and olive oil all have a nutrition label but in general the more food sold the way it comes from the farm, the better, for sure!!

4611 2018-02-22 14:44:10 Agreed. Giving a teacher a gun is akin to running oil pipelines through a civilization's vital water supply. If we want to live in harmony, we (Americans) have to do the opposite of what we're doing.

4750 2018-02-22 14:26:19 They obviously want a permanent terrorist enclave near Damascus and Syria's main oil fields to the hands of Americans in US occupied area. They don't really care about us outside of US or our democracies or human values.

4763 2018-02-22 14:25:00 No one good would ever support Big Oil from stomping out alternative energy; no one good supports hiding cancer cures to sustain continuing cancer treatment.

Except those with agendas.

You and yours act exactly towards $IOTA as Big Pharma does to cures for diseases.
4764 2018-02-22 14:24:50 Y’all I put argon oil on my face as moisturizer

4774 2018-02-22 14:22:20 Take for example how oil corporations donate in a single election ten times more than the NRA has donated in 10 years to senators and yet congress has kept passing regulations and bills that do not favor the oil industry. 

Again, the constitution and gun right came first.

4776 2018-02-22 14:22:11 CNN/MSM are trying to divide, suppress the MAGA train vote; stay strong & focused.  Rehnquist will announce retirement, we need to VOTE in November to keep Senate!
4777 2018-02-22 14:22:08 Medical Mary Jane and CBD oil  will help solve many mental problems and other health related problems if we use it wisely. Pass a tax bill for Mary Jane and this will also lower our national debt crisis.  It will put FARMERS BACK TO WORK!

4779 2018-02-22 14:21:39 @RachelNotley can bc forbid shipment of oil after the pipeline is built ? we need the federal government to find that out.
4780 2018-02-22 14:21:29 So you’ll fix this right after you fix DACA right? Peddle that snake oil elsewhere because your record shows you won’t do a thing. Oh - don’t forget to say “I hear you.”
4781 2018-02-22 14:21:24 Well at least then the pipelines for Alberta oil would get built!

4792 2018-02-22 14:19:58 NO Syria is the product of the west funding and arming terrorist groups in efforts to topple governments of the region and take control of the oil.

4794 2018-02-22 14:19:57 Theoretically this makes sense. But is it practicable? How would this be handled logistically? I see how China can do it with CNY oil contract but what about Russia?
4795 2018-02-22 14:19:51 Great. Let's turn schools into military academies to train kids to go off to the next war for oil.
4796 2018-02-22 14:19:47 Let’s think like a country.need energy policy that puts energy security, jobs & climate action as shared goals. Build upgraders & refineries in Alberta, sell finished product across Canada; end the import of foreign oil; & plan for orderly phase-out of fossil fuel. @ElizabethMay

4817 2018-02-22 14:18:17 A closer look at the data is required but 1 q: Is it perhaps that imports have occupied the supply chains that were uprooted after DeMo? As I understand, this surge is not because of bulk imports (oil, etc)...
4818 2018-02-22 14:18:14 Ditto that @Abu_Troll, @PatrickOsgood is certainly not what you say @ATDLive he criticizes (& praises) men & women equally, mostly 2 set the record straight w uninformed reporting. Also, he knows more & has written more on Iraqi & KRG oil sector than almost anyone, hands down.

4848 2018-02-22 14:14:25 Feb.21 (Bloomberg) -- Rising oil supply from non-OPEC countries may cover global demand growth for the next two years, according to the International Energy Agency. That could force OPEC to stick to output cuts for much longer than planned.

4885 2018-02-22 14:11:21 America’s Emerging Petro Economy Flips the The effect of oil prices on the U.S. economy used to be straightforward: Higher was bad. Yet between 2014 and early 2016, as oil collapsed , growth slowed sharply. Since then oil has doubled, yet the economy has accelerated.

4889 2018-02-22 14:11:13 Big issue at the moment is positioning and market leverage - oil will follow s&p down in risk off scenarios

4892 2018-02-22 14:10:59 O yes I forgot Arabs invented everything. Thats why they received so many Nobelprizes...  Without Western technology the oil would still be in the ground. Islam destroyed all the knowledge and library's.
4893 2018-02-22 14:10:58 Yes it should be harder to own firearms than it is to dispose engine oil. Yes the assault weapons and extended clips should be outlawed but people still have the right to own firearms.

4941 2018-02-22 14:06:19 Yes, & Russia gains mkt share in china fr anyone only pricing oil in USD bc $44 is cheaper than $60.  IMO it's elegant bc upward pressure on gold is de facto downward pressure on USD.  This is why I keep saying china can use CNY oil & gold contracts to ctrl int'l trade val of USD
4942 2018-02-22 14:06:08 Man sees fire. Uses oil to put it out. Pockets $30 million
4943 2018-02-22 14:06:04 I follow Orthodox Lent wrt meat, dairy, eggs but I eat oil. Do you eat oil during Lent? Seems like that would be a big deal in the Med.

4957 2018-02-22 14:05:03 *speaking
4958 2018-02-22 14:04:52 So oil was revalued down rather than gold up...interesting
4959 2018-02-22 14:04:44 I don’t watch TV. From what I gather it’s all about pure-hearted rookies saving the world from corrupted money grubbing snake oil salespersons. Probably cost some viewers their lives but hey ad revenue.
4960 2018-02-22 14:04:39 My new favourite food tradition is (when I have a day off) to take an eggplant, slice it up, and slowly fry it in olive oil, paprika, and chili powder. As each piece finishes, you eat it in a sandwich with hummus 
4961 2018-02-22 14:04:38 Butts is worried that his gravy train is near its end and he’ll have to get a real job. Hey Gerry? Ever worked on an oil rig or pipeline crew? They pay top dollar and will give you new coveralls. The whole country would pay to see you in an honest job for a change.

4970 2018-02-22 14:03:39 Oil falls as stronger dollar eclipses U.S. inventory drop
4971 2018-02-22 14:03:36 Maybe...when a version of this happened in 2014 upon opening of SGEI (Gold/oil ratio went from 13 bbls/oz to 30x in 4 mths), gold bulls didn't party, oil bulls cried as oil fell from $93 to $40 in 4 mths...
4972 2018-02-22 14:03:27 K.. lets play that out.  Russia says we will give you 30bbls oil per oz.  Effectively 44USD in todays prices.  Russia give oil/gets gold.. and continues until physical drain/strain forces AU prices up due to lack of phys?
4973 2018-02-22 14:03:14 The title should be: Planning for our immigrants. I doubt  Infrastructure Australia has done any resource calculations: water, food, oil, energy etc. In 30 years Sydney will look different from today but not the way you naively think
4974 2018-02-22 14:03:14 Spelt oil sands wrong
4975 2018-02-22 14:02:50 Perhaps. But as demand softens price may soften. This happened or is happening with coal.  Falling oil price (plus pipeline wars) has impacted Canadian tar sands development. US tight oil may be vulnerable to downward price pressure in 15-20 years.

5013 2018-02-22 13:59:19 Yes.  Suddenly Russian Gold FX reserves are worth a lot more in terms of Russia's biggest export, & Russian oil is cheapest on the global mkt (400 bbls per oz v 22 bbls per oz COMEX/NYMEX.)  move wouldn't have to be that extreme, could go to 30 or 40 or 50 bbls per oz
5014 2018-02-22 13:59:19 I've learned that #sustainablepalmoil is palm oil that has been certified by  @RSPOtweets. What conditions make palm oil production sustainable?

5458 2018-02-22 13:00:13 The trouble is that with oil you can store it and wait for the infrastructure to catch up - much harder with electricity - though not impossible - hydrogen ferries anyone?

5471 2018-02-22 12:59:12 I HAD TO SKIP THE SEX SCENE ITS TOO MUCH FOR THIS 17 YEAR OLD VIRGIN OLIVE OIL
5472 2018-02-22 12:59:05 Because... 

Excess skin oil will be produced within the pores. During puberty and other life events, fluctuating hormones can result in increased androgen levels. As these glands mature, oil production increases.
5473 2018-02-22 12:58:37 Nice! Yeah, that is a great doc. If you're OK with oil, 'Isa Does It' by @IsaChandra is my all time favorite cookbooks my copy is well loved to say the least. On the other end of the spectrum there is anything by @ForksOverKnives, @Engine2Diet. @DrFuhrman's books are also amazing
5474 2018-02-22 12:58:36 Good thing you bought that overpriced snap on jacket to let people know that you change oil 
5475 2018-02-22 12:58:16 Graham was just another televangelist who knew where his bread was buttered. Pushing the southern white ideal that sanitized the status quo so he could sell more of his snake oil. Kissing presidential ass was just a means of marketing what he was selling, nothing more.

5483 2018-02-22 12:57:47 Hello, a boycott would mean brands stop buying palm oil and switch to another oil. These oils use up to nine times more land, which would lead to increased #deforestation and species loss.

5520 2018-02-22 12:53:28 I believe he did. Perhaps some oil workers are only just becoming aware? I don't know. 
What I do think is if the numbers have increased since 2014? Then that's quite worrying. 
I'd like to know if true? Then why?

5588 2018-02-22 12:43:07 I was in the military and I would not be comfortable in that situation at all.  Why arm a teacher with no weapons experience? Casualties, teachers with PTSD, etc. it's adding oil to fire instead of cutting the oxygen.
5589 2018-02-22 12:43:02 Rex Tillerson might know oil but all he's doing in the government is following orders from Trump as in "go through every piece of email HRC sent out or received and find something damaging" there's not enough email in the world t o catch up to Trumps crimes.
5590 2018-02-22 12:42:50 Try putting thieves essential oil on your gums, that’s what i used when I had braces and when my wisdom teeth were removed (I also had an infection). It tastes gross for the first few minutes but it numbs the pain so much. A life saver!!

5627 2018-02-22 12:39:02 And seeds. As well as to a lower extent of oil. - Again, people who just feel they can thrive off meat and meet every requirement is dangerous mentality.

5636 2018-02-22 12:37:57 Fair enough. As long as we agree that homeopathy is bunkum. Or (not even any remaining trace of) Snake Oil.
5637 2018-02-22 12:37:55 My understanding, through the Pheonix Tears folk, is that the oil MUST be rich in THC. They have been curing people for decades government has turned a blind eye @JustinTrudeau As a matter a fact, Trudope has a 300 page document #registered delivered to him #rso Yet it is illegal
5638 2018-02-22 12:37:33 Warning us about what will happen at $70/bbl, but oil eventually came down to sub $30/bbl,nobody should do any crocodile tears for us,our Govt managed a very difficult period in Nigeria's history with credit in 2016;economic team did a yeoman job.

5643 2018-02-22 12:36:56 Historically the goal of England's power is to 'quell' Scotland, by taxes, by limiting international trade, in the 20th century by land exploitation, oil, and destruction of our heavy industry. No one need feel a victim. You need to be angry and want to reinstall full democracy.
5644 2018-02-22 12:36:55 U know I'm speaking from experience geh
5645 2018-02-22 12:36:43 Whilst im@guessing palm oil has been around for many years, why is it now need in 50% of products, what did we use before?
5646 2018-02-22 12:36:28 haha - that looks pretty similar to me - baking soda tooth paste gives your hole a horny tingle and gets your natural lube flowing, Xylocaine, I like to add coconut, jojoba and clove oil to my mix
5647 2018-02-22 12:36:20 "a surplus of graduates only increases competition and devalues our certificates means overall it's at a disadvantage." --> so we should deliberately not let some people go to school ? There is competition now because Nigeria's economy starts and ends with crude oil.
5648 2018-02-22 12:36:17 Parents had been doing more work than I do over the years and here I am doing it for about a week plus (still much lesser) and I smell strongly of oil and muscle ache balms 
5649 2018-02-22 12:36:15 I am ready to wait for a low risk reward. it moved very early last time and oil prices are favorable right now.
5650 2018-02-22 12:36:09 Now all of the benefit of the oil revenues is in private hands and all the benefits provided by the oil revenues have been taken away. This is how American capitalism works. It is a very corrupt system held afloat by endless propaganda.

5655 2018-02-22 12:34:42 So, address the hate then. Fact is, America has a huge problem and you (the people) can't solve it by ignoring it or putting more guns out there. That's like oil to a fire.

5720 2018-02-22 12:24:58 Are there no sustainable sources of palm oil and why do we need it in our products?
5721 2018-02-22 12:24:54 Islam spread is a political movement more than a religious one, backed by corrupted oil tycoons in Qatar dreaming of a world ruled by Sharia law. When you convert to Islam you go a thousand years backwards to a false and ridiculous attempt to copy Christianity and Judaism

5726 2018-02-22 12:23:31 This is absurd,Sam.

Nowhere my tweet relate to region except the wicked cartel represented by oil major u reported about.

Ask any1 familiar with NNPC depot operation,they still hv more allocation than IPMAN,but prefer to auction right there at the depot to independent marketers
5727 2018-02-22 12:23:24 I love using oil pastels in coloring my assignments....tbh
5728 2018-02-22 12:22:57 Peddling conspiracy theories to sabotage democracy doesn't stop the inertia of the truth.

But it does does continue to paint the snake oil salesmen further into a corner.

5732 2018-02-22 12:22:32 My opinion of oil shale &fracking &ocean drilling is 1 cuts to injured workers allow oil to expand production 2 shale just fracking whole industry is environmental super duper crime done by elites caring little if 100 of millions starve or go thirsty cause the water is no good

5738 2018-02-22 12:21:24 The South produces crude. So many oil depots situated here. A lot of tankers moving petroleum products to different places. Road is bad. Road is very very bad. Edo state to Abuja is not motorable. We have a need to address this issue
5739 2018-02-22 12:21:21 I make a keto chia latte in the mornings, steep 5 bags black chia tea, blend in mixer with butter, coconut oil, hemp milk, half and half, red pepper, black pepper, cinnamon, Stevie, touch of black coffee. Maybe it is an "Everything Chia"
5740 2018-02-22 12:21:07 I am an essential oil lover & tea drinker so that’s that. As of recently, my whole lifestyle switch up has caught everyone off guard (which is good). I’m excited to see where this is taking me.

5742 2018-02-22 12:20:41 They are confused. At this point whatever they  used to believe has been crowded out by propaganda clickbate and memes. My Trump supporting fam would have lost their minds after opening up oil drilling on public land and blowing up deficit 3 years ago. Now they cheer.

5796 2018-02-22 12:10:51 The same argument could be made for nearly every natural resource yet this is how the global markets choose to do business?

5856 2018-02-22 12:01:47 The country recently struck oil & that's what everyone is eyeing. You may never enjoy the proceeds of the so called oil with this reckless borrowing & that's when Turkana will turn to another Niger.

I mostly follow a whole-food plant-based diet; I generally avoid processed foods, sugar, oil, and I hate how that's somehow "not OK" but promoting processed foods is..?

5931 2018-02-22 11:46:58 Yes, the problem is that not all oil is created equal...We can produce all this shale oil and that's fine, but if only a tiny % of it is refinery-ready, and it takes a lot of other heavy (imported) oil and other stuff to make it 'good', well, then it is not much use at all.
5932 2018-02-22 11:46:41 I had a huge problem with this when younger. Trick I used. I love mint. So before each ride, I would dab vick's or tea tree oil on my nose. And I'd do it at shows too, keeps the brain thinking it's just another practice ride, nothing different about it. Worked like a charm.

6140 2018-02-22 11:08:39 You are so right. We have moved on from the seventh century  and from 33AD for that matter. Those that want to treat these ancient texts as a blueprint for living should be riding around on donkeys and using oil lamps.

6160 2018-02-22 11:05:45 Last year, the Senate was told that Nigeria has since June 2015, been exporting its oil and non-oil products without documentation.This means the country lost over N23.6 billion expected to be repatriated proceeds of the export within the period.
6161 2018-02-22 11:05:37 Butter vs oil, is just a way of demarcating the real Hellenistic world from N.Europe. Beer vs wine would be a less precise way of doing it.

6192 2018-02-22 11:01:06 NRA is not a business. Know your facts when formulating a thoughtful opinion. These people are a part of an association (think assembly as I’m freedom of assembly...). It lobbies on behalf of actual voters not like pharma or oil who lobby for profits

6219 2018-02-22 10:54:34 Well, logical common sense would argue that ‘if it’s OK to continue with the use of strong Opiates in prescription painkillers’, then the use of natural herbs such as cannabis leaf & oil should not be considered a negative, as surely millions of MS sufferers can verify?

So I thought I'd ask those who know.

6490 2018-02-22 10:00:01 Totally not what I was meaning, I was meaning not smart about saving money for when it does fall. Oil field is good money my dad did it forever. It’s hard work, long hours, and frankly most people are too much of pussies to be able to. That being said hats off to those that can.
6491 2018-02-22 09:59:43 Exactly. Also the same reason I do no more than check oil, water and tyre pressures in my car. Modern stuff is not built for diy repairs. A TV that cost £1200 ten years ago has a bigger/better version for £300 so no sense in repairing the old set!
6492 2018-02-22 09:59:41 @gwennan_thomas Once this oil slick has been cleaned up/dispersed it'll be important to monitor the ongoing pollution that enters the Lea on a continual basis.

6508 2018-02-22 09:54:30 The reasoning is affordability. There are no private sector schemes like this still open to new members because they are so expensive to run. If oil companies, banks can't afford them it's unlikely a university will be able to, unfortunately.

If you lazy just use rose water alone or witch hazel alone sudah. For some people that's enough.

6698 2018-02-22 09:14:55 Umm... you do know which direction the fiscal transfer is going at the moment? And unless oil revenues suddenly reverted to their peak levels (which is unlikely) then subsidizing rUK (not just England) isn't going to happen.
6699 2018-02-22 09:14:08 I tried biore oil cleanser tp naik bump dua tiga biji dkt dahi. Before this guna hada labo and simple okay je. Maybe because biore tu ada mineral oil. Simple & Hada Labo skincare range is the best gais!

6701 2018-02-22 09:13:51 Chips will burn because they are starch-based and for the reason that they are fried in oil, which in turn is absorbed by the potato, hence, when exposed to an open flame, they will burn.

6711 2018-02-22 09:12:29 Russia is still locked in holding pattern by Soviet era ideals. Putin has a few years left as despot, controlling material wealth (oil) and seizing land. Other economies run on information and service and aren't looking back

6715 2018-02-22 09:11:34 Regardless of what your opinion on palm oil is, I do think you should mention that Michelle is a member of the RSPO complaints panel, and that Michelle has accepted money from palm oil companies, which I believe is a conflict of interest.

6745 2018-02-22 09:04:47 "Wyoming's Senate File 74 makes 'impeding critical infrastructure … a felony.'"

6758 2018-02-22 09:03:01 @leecamp "fracking" paved the way for drilling into America's enormous shale deposits fueling a dramatic boom in US oil production. USA citizens were only ok with fracking because they were told buying oil from Middle East would finance "evil terrorists" who would destroy USA?

6773 2018-02-22 08:59:42 The wealthy folks (like Elon Musk) who have suggested this idea know they're selling snake oil. If they weren't, they'd have cut the government out of it and set the system up themselves, knowing it'd be their income level taxed to pay for it & gov't involvement is unnecessary.
6774 2018-02-22 08:59:15 The US is controlled by big lobbies, guns, oil, banking, pharma. The “people” have no power it’s an illusion. Therefore those kids will not be anywhere close to leading anything unless they fall in line and follow the big agendas. It’s a romantic thought though.

6781 2018-02-22 08:57:40 I don't think so.  If we as consumer reduce ours usage of that product,  it won't be necessary for those guys to create more oil, if there's no demand
6782 2018-02-22 08:57:31 Following the pharmacist's advice, I put 2 drops of olive oil in my ear yesterday to clear the wax. Now I can't hear anything. As far as I can understand, the best response to this is to add more olive oil. I'm feeling like the main ingredient in a Jamie Oliver recipe.
6783 2018-02-22 08:57:29 it’s a funny/alarming article to read, where reducing oil consumption comes across as something to be worried about...

7096 2018-02-22 07:53:18 It’s the method to actually go deep down the root of the problem and slowly recover from it. There’s a lot of ways and a lot products to try on. There’s oil cleanser then water based cleanser then toney, vitamin C for the scars then mask etc. You should try it

7100 2018-02-22 07:52:13 When you look to see how many land speed records were in electric cars in the 1800s, you start to realize that we never needed to go down the #Oil path. After almost destroying our planet, the only real positive is that it made a few ppl & countries fabulously wealthy.

7229 2018-02-22 07:30:16 In Nigeria under PMB, mockery is an acceptable social standard.

Boko kidnapped truck with police women, students, researchers and oil workers looking for oil in the desert, snake ate Jamb's ₦36M, monkey took ₦70M, when would the president swears in his 10 dead appointees.

7234 2018-02-22 07:26:48 Zero desperation in the OT frame. Sucks to say, but the better team won tonight. That PP was awful. Looked eerily similar to the Oil PP.
7235 2018-02-22 07:26:42 Gotta say, I do find it surprising that there were so few legit scoring chances in OT. There were certainly some but considering both sides were on fumes, far fewer than one expects over 20 mins of 4v4. #CAN #USA

7239 2018-02-22 07:26:01 My dear friend, same pronunciation dosen't give the same meaning or derived similarities, that was my point
7240 2018-02-22 07:25:56 Bought a new air purifier. It stinks of plastic or oil. Ironic, because it’s supposed to clean the air, not stink it up. I hope the smell goes away. I figured the handful of reviewers who mentioned this smell were doing something wrong.
7241 2018-02-22 07:25:52 Crude #oil dipped to $61.00 a barrel, ahead of the EIA government report due later in the day
7242 2018-02-22 07:25:43 Oh, FINE!  Split hairs!!  Yes, yes... you are correct - the gasoline is the same... indeed, I do need the oil!  But..  did you miss the point?

While news of Saturday’s dangerous escalation involving Syria’s downing of an Israeli fighter jet is fizzling out, Israeli plan’s for a broader war to secure water and oil reserves in the resource-rich Golan Heights are just getting underway.
7244 2018-02-22 07:25:11 @JDefteriosCNN Few years ago a committee constituted by the government had reccomended that special norms should be adopted by all Oil Marketing Companies while posting officers/personnel at sensitive locations storing and distributing fuels across the country
7245 2018-02-22 07:24:58 Illegal logging concessions again, secret plans to change the Forest Code, now oil concessions all over your favourite REDD project area. What are you going to say about that?

7249 2018-02-22 07:23:34 Agreed. But not at increased risk. The economic contribution of Metro Van to BC & Canada is significant. Oil exports cannot take priority. A spill is too costly to the economy, environment, and health. There is too much at stake here.

7276 2018-02-22 07:18:24 "If crude oil does rally, which is the general expectation around the Saudi Aramco IPO later in this year, then we may see a large uptick in inflation which could lead to a reversal in interest rates back home as well.Could really puncture the secular bull market that we are in"

7300 2018-02-22 07:13:53 If after 6 decades, Nigeria is still asking how a summit held on her soil can benefit its economy,it shows one thing - leadership failure. We've failed as a nation.Nations which discovered oil after us have turned their countries to an el dorado of sort.Nigeria's case is pathetic
7301 2018-02-22 07:12:33 This summit should afford us opportunity to showcase our national commitment, policy & effort of gov’t in the entrepreneur sector,sanitize the sector, expand the investment opportunities to boost Nigeria content developmt & legalization of Nig as a leading oil producer in Africa!

7313 2018-02-22 07:10:11 Pushing flame scorched limos to the oil rig tonight, for the promenade dance
7314 2018-02-22 07:10:10 Why would, to take an example: Fewer people will drive large cars, be a bad thing? Given the huge externalities from using oil, the over usage of gasoline by huge vehicles is something that everyone else has to pay for.

7330 2018-02-22 07:06:14 Left a tiny rose oil bottle with rose petals on Aleeha's bed stand. I won't be surprised if it takes her days/weeks to notice I put it there since she's so damn oblivious 
7331 2018-02-22 07:06:02 Obviously corrupt liars saying the exact opposite while accepting big oil money?
7332 2018-02-22 07:05:57 Until we have the guts to deregulate the downstream oil sector, and the maturity to stomach the undulating prices that follow, this drivel will not cease.

7371 2018-02-22 06:59:56 The Int’l Oil Summit’s resolutions, should help Nigeria to produce Oil & Gas at cheaper cost, diversify the processing of our oil,internalizing & externalising investment in the sector & capture the requisite technological skills that are essential to help us operate efficiently!

7382 2018-02-22 06:57:26 You can do whatever you want to your citizens as long as USA controls your wealth and resources. It's about the money and has nothing to do with human rights, freedom,. It just makes it sound good to people. People don't want to send their kids to die so Exxon can pump more oil

Markets have a mind of their own. If an industry leader went after activist groups w/ media budgets 1/10th the size of theirs they would look like crybabies and deserve it.
7398 2018-02-22 06:53:18 Its the difference between Saudi Arabia and Iraq/Libya. Saudi Arabian leaders place all their wealth in U.S. corporations as investments, in stock market, allow U.S. oil corps to control their refineries where Iraq and Libya did not.

7404 2018-02-22 06:52:01 Now that I know how to change the oil in my car I’m pretty confident I could take apart and rebuild the entire engine without instructions 
7405 2018-02-22 06:52:01 Cuci tangan dulu. Then lap bagi kering. 2 kali pump. Muka dan tangan jangan basah. Urut kat muka slow-2. Dah rasa puas hati. Lap dengan tisu basah.. Nak basuh dengan air pun boleh. Then pakai cleanser yang harian tu. Kita pakai cosmoderm dan neutrogena oil cleanser.

"The Kurds" was never really a useful signifier for the complex alliances from Tel Abyad to Manbij & Afrin - the US can build up DMC without helping YPG
7408 2018-02-22 06:51:38 Flaxseed oil is a possible alternative, but it really is difficult to replace this source.

7797 2018-02-22 05:37:33 Aloe oil is really good for calming redness and bumps and I believe irritation? I know certain oils like Tea Tree can really help-just lower the intensity with water.

All I can do is laugh.  Just need to quit looking and worrying
7799 2018-02-22 05:37:06 Someone at the show insisted on writing their number on my hand in oil marker but the number is eight digits ...
7800 2018-02-22 05:36:50 but not soybean oil.
7801 2018-02-22 05:36:48 Of course...this time of year I search the internet for sports radio that talks hockey
7802 2018-02-22 05:36:37 I was at Trader Joe's today and checked for you. Both of them had either canola oil or sunflower oil.

7804 2018-02-22 05:36:28 Dnt mind this shameless man,I pray one day he's caught up by the inferno of the polity he's heating up with his shameless lies and propaganda, the greatest sadist of our time.
7805 2018-02-22 05:36:05 Well they got you to listen- the squeaky wheel gets the oil -it’s time for all of us to make some noise for change- so you are sooooo offended by these kids - bull shit try another tack ‘cause I don’t think these heroes are going to be silenced by your self righteous indignation
7806 2018-02-22 05:35:48 It's exactly the endless drip these groups were looking for to reach critical mass where the industry becomes non-viable. They're not there yet. But boy are we heading down those tracks faster. Meanwhile conflict oil eats our lunch.
7807 2018-02-22 05:35:43 He warned them over and over again at his rallies about the snake oil salesman he is. They didn't get it then and don't get it now. Some people were just born suckers.
7808 2018-02-22 05:35:35 Sad when they have to be praised for facing their constituents, it is part of their job. After all that is who they work for right?...oh wait...$NRA $Koch $Oil

7821 2018-02-22 05:34:02 But the bc government can stop a pipe line that would ship oil from coast to coast isn't that stopping free trade and trading products throw Canada also?!  The bc government really needs to take a long look in there mirror and ask if there really helping ppl!
7822 2018-02-22 05:33:57 It will be the joke of the century if it works, let's take Venezuela out of the equation: a cryptocurrency backed by  in-demand  commodity and exchangeable for btc. If the whales can use their excess btc to build up private stockpiles of oil. Interesting times
7823 2018-02-22 05:33:54 let me rub your booty with baby oil

7826 2018-02-22 05:33:33 You haven't seen peak crazy quite like Alaska. All the years of easy oil revenues causes people like Pete Kelly to throw childish tantrums.
7827 2018-02-22 05:33:26 Humari raw bhi KGB ki tarah strong and powerfull nhi he

7828 2018-02-22 05:33:23 When someone act just like you y’all either gonna be the perfect match or like water and oil.
7829 2018-02-22 05:33:09 I hear your theory, but realistically, if the poor spend, say R600 on Groceries, about R100 would arguably be on VAT exempt items (bread, milk, mealie meal, cooking oil etc). The 1% extra VAT impact on the R500 translates to R5.
7830 2018-02-22 05:32:59 Calgary needs to shut the pipes down in BC. It's time to stop this madness and get the pipeline going. Everyone thinks you can live without oil go live in BC when pipes go down. Then let  us know how well that works for you.
7831 2018-02-22 05:31:54 Maybe I should eat a whole tub of coconut oil since it gives life to everything else.
7832 2018-02-22 05:31:53 The fact that I can buy a gram of oil for 10 dollars and a gram of weed for 4 dollars is fucking mind blowing to me I love living in Washington state #marijuana
7833 2018-02-22 05:31:49 Looking great. Don't change your game on one opinion. If you really wanted to be a oil painted feeling. I think it's great , or maybe a different shader will do the trick. Good luck though. Best I have scene by far.
7834 2018-02-22 05:31:38 If we really have oil, wa Trinidad ago have over we now? Lol
7835 2018-02-22 05:31:19 1. Why, oh why, isn't there a refinery in #Alberta? More permanent jobs. Heck, we might even manufacture stuff there.  2. BC has every right to protect its own economy & jobs.  3. Hubby is one of 350K Ontario jobs lost when dollar soared on oil. We didn't whine.  #AlbertaWHine

7838 2018-02-22 05:31:01 At least 0.5 cents

7840 2018-02-22 05:30:41 extra @AngelsKimi olive oil
7841 2018-02-22 05:30:34 Or how about our increased domestic oil production? Increased domestic supply and export does NOTHING but hurt Russia.
7842 2018-02-22 05:30:32 Used to be able to get it from Blackfoot truck stop. Tasted like motor oil...

7850 2018-02-22 05:28:51 Yes, but the teachers have to buy their own bullets and gun oil.
7851 2018-02-22 05:28:33 Great observation.
7852 2018-02-22 05:28:26 Oh, but there was all of that sweet, sweet crude for foreign oil companies to plunder.
7853 2018-02-22 05:28:21 Every time I cook, the oil shoots out of the pan directly into my eyeball. Is oil sentient? How does it always find my most vulnerable bits?
7854 2018-02-22 05:28:12 E go shock you this weekend
7855 2018-02-22 05:28:06 i could actually hear you laughing @fuslie from your room at @iGumdrop_

7859 2018-02-22 05:27:34 Gears are jamming. With all that oil, you’d think the russkies could lube their bots.
7860 2018-02-22 05:27:33 Exactly, the input costs of Bread, cooking oil, Milk are not zero vat rated. The long and short of it is that poor people will pay more for food as a result of this VAT increase
7861 2018-02-22 05:27:20 We'll agree to disagree, sir.

7867 2018-02-22 05:26:08 Forsan Tx is named after the four types of sand they found digging here for oil. We used to have a cafe called Foursands Cafe.
7868 2018-02-22 05:25:47 Oil BOYCOTT? What about a CRYPTOCURRENCY BOYCOTT? The new Sadam Hussein. And poor Columbia footing the bill for all the Venezualans abandoning their country.  He needs to be removed.
7869 2018-02-22 05:24:58 Geez, how did we sell oil before you came along?
7870 2018-02-22 05:24:32 Today bought a huge hammer, went grocery shopping, ran a lot, took the best bath EVER, covered my body and hair in coconut oil, and held a plank for 90 seconds. New meds and all this working out are making me better I swear.
7871 2018-02-22 05:24:30 Week 3 of 16 - Day 7: nothing today... had to fix the car (broken steering wheel), no headlights, oil change, broken window...
7872 2018-02-22 05:24:30 Venezuela are an economic basket case - they try to fix their currency against the dollar or, as they are now, barrels of oil.

They will not fix their problems while they continue to not let market economics find the true value of the bolivar.
7873 2018-02-22 05:24:23 My dad just came in my room & blew out the candle that was burning my oil that helps me sleep.
7874 2018-02-22 05:24:16 Not a problem!! There are other trouble makers letting IPAC run the show too..blocking CBD oil and any medical cannabis legislation.
7875 2018-02-22 05:23:53 People pray for cake... but when the almighty gives them eggs, oil, butter, batter, a pan & an oven they get frustrated & leave the kitchen.

7879 2018-02-22 05:23:24 I tried CBD oil, without THC. It didn’t help me. I’ve heard that it needs a little bit of THC to be effect.
7880 2018-02-22 05:23:06 I believe you should use your detective skills more and shape your theory from evidence not select your evidence to match your theory. What is urban to you? I live in rural Canada, farming and oil country, travel extensively and have lived in mega cities am old and a skeptic.
7881 2018-02-22 05:22:57 This is the same Left that ball washes Venezuela dictators and funds nuclear dreams of insane Iranian mullahs. They back oil rich countries that shoot this own citizens in street. Self defense is a right. It's needed with self delusion of the Left
7882 2018-02-22 05:22:49 Just curious where your gas and everything else you get from oil comes from. Including your phone. Gonna give that up are you?

7888 2018-02-22 05:22:06 I have some very strong feelings from those years tied to pieces of music, so when I hear them it's like falling backward through time. I can smell pencil shavings, linseed oil and hear trains.  I suppose it's like being haunted in a way. *shrug*
7889 2018-02-22 05:22:04 ~5.~ When we take a bath for cleanliness it is necessary to use a little soap, so as to remove the oil

地中海沿岸です
7895 2018-02-22 05:20:50 Mostly L’Oréal or oil of Olay. The night cream stuff.  Neutrogena by day. 
But willing to try anything
7896 2018-02-22 05:20:48 If he gets the PDB he pretty much sees TS-SCI or worse and PaPa Trump doesn’t care as long as Putin gets sanctions lifted, Black Sea oil deal goes thru, Trillions for Putin/Russia, Trump Debt=Zero. That’s QuidProQuo for ya!
7897 2018-02-22 05:20:44 When I say massive dent, 1M bopd will cause a lot of heartache. Recent oil price plunge were due to just a 2% oversupply, approx 2M bopd and they still haven’t recovered from that almost 4 years later. It could be a lot more than 1M by 2025.
7898 2018-02-22 05:20:39 When oil men complain about taxes and regulations, remember they told Norway the industry would close before they paid taxes demanded. Instead, they stayed, paid about a trillion dollars in taxes and still profited. Bluff and bluster is part of the game. #abpoli #cdnpoli
7899 2018-02-22 05:20:20 Always check the temprature of your olive oil coarsely.  Feel free to substitute the non-vegan version.  Next, separate the beans.
7900 2018-02-22 05:19:50 The tobacco industry blazed a trail with its campaign of bold insistence that smoking didn’t cause cancer, and its decades of diversionary tactics as to the question— since copied by the oil industry, gun industry, and on various scales numerous others.
7901 2018-02-22 05:19:50 Rose waternya new kak...45k aja, kalo yg oil 60k aja kak 95%

7904 2018-02-22 05:19:21 I'm ok with this if we raise voting and enlistment ages as well. 
Honestly, I can't think of anything dumber than an 18-20 year old, on average.

7906 2018-02-22 05:19:13 There’s a doterra oil called last tense that you put on your temples also and it helps me also. My brother in law gets really bad migraines and he sniffs the peppermint oil like every five minutes lol

7917 2018-02-22 05:17:28 I can barely breathe this water thanks to YOUR oil spill.  Humans are heartless.
7918 2018-02-22 05:17:03 The LORD anoints my head with oil.
7919 2018-02-22 05:16:59 let me know how it goes. All you need is a cast iron skillet, 1 lemon, head of garlic, oil or butter, salt/pepper, and a good quality chicken. And an oven. So good.
7920 2018-02-22 05:16:44 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
7921 2018-02-22 05:16:07 I don’t understand how her comment has anything to do with Obama, try to stay on topic. She very kindly replied to your irrelevant comment and if you get someone to help you sound out the big words you will see she did answer your question. Vile deplorable attacking

7928 2018-02-22 05:15:05 Got a lot of coconut oil. Good idea!!
7929 2018-02-22 05:14:49 So bc can reject our oil and the pipe line, but we can't reject their wine??? Seems to be a bit one sided.
7930 2018-02-22 05:14:28 I have donated 50 million dollars worth of oil, which is approximately 73,000 shares of Standard Oil, to begin the establishment of the Rockefeller Foundation and it will soon become the largest foundation.
7931 2018-02-22 05:14:26 Issues too complex for politicians to solve:

Opiod crisis: Pharmaceutical manufacturers want higher profits

7940 2018-02-22 05:13:39 Folks. The NRA is not a corporation. It's not big oil, or wallstreet. It is made up of members, like myself that voluntarily join so that our interest can be heard. Candidates that are supported because they reflect our interests. Donations to candidates come from dues.

7945 2018-02-22 05:13:04 Putting coconut oil in really long thick hair is one of the most annoying/gross but well worth it processes
7946 2018-02-22 05:13:02 Self spa night  bath, deep conditioned my hair, almond oil head to toe, did my nails, healthy dinner & meal plan friendly dessert. Now up late with bae watching the women’s hockey game, stretching out by the fireplace. I love being home and not at work. 
7947 2018-02-22 05:13:00 So far it seems to be working a little. I'm using a mix of coconut oil (it's helped me in the past with the same thing) and castor oil.
7948 2018-02-22 05:12:39 @nailogical How long after a shower should I wait to oil my nails?
7949 2018-02-22 05:12:31 Btw if anyone is looking for a good  exfoliant.. ground coffee beans mixed with a little bit of coconut oil is great.
7950 2018-02-22 05:12:24 Lol, Mohan is the oil/ghee used for binding, basically makes or breaks the food.
7951 2018-02-22 05:12:17 Fed signals further rate hikes, interest rates rise, U.S. dollar appreciates, price of oil falls.  That's the news for today.  It's that simple.  I have a feeling tomorrow will be at least as interesting.#italwaysis
7952 2018-02-22 05:12:15 I pakai biore oil cleanser. I minta pendapat someone about my scar and share my routine skincare. So that she replied
7953 2018-02-22 05:12:07 E V I L
7954 2018-02-22 05:12:02 Jamaica has to learn from others like Trinidad that any major discovery of its oil remains truly sovereign and not allow explorers to rape our resources. #OilDiscovery
7955 2018-02-22 05:11:53 That too. I cannot believe the way popular culture treats conservative women. The fact that dehumanizing them is normalized is just so wrong.
7956 2018-02-22 05:11:44 Take a screenshot, then commission a floor-to-ceiling oil painting of the moment. Or maybe a mural
7957 2018-02-22 05:11:34 Cat mom moment of the day: I leave a bottle of peppermint oil open on the counter. Keep in peppermint oil can cause seizures in cats. 
7958 2018-02-22 05:11:13 1882 | I have a near-monopoly of the oil business in the United States...
7959 2018-02-22 05:11:01 Peppermint oil is good deterant for mice....not sure about rats
7960 2018-02-22 05:10:53 Take a screenshot, then commission a floor-to-ceiling oil painting of the moment. Or maybe a mural
7961 2018-02-22 05:10:48 Unless you’re like 75 lol. But yeah for almost everybody the $500 is a better deal.
7962 2018-02-22 05:10:47 These refs in this game make me feel like I'm watching an Oilers game. Atleast it's better hockey... oh, and thankfully the girls have a better penalty kill than the mighty Oil.
7963 2018-02-22 05:10:45 If that’s the calls then im even more perplexed at the non-calls??
7964 2018-02-22 05:10:42 @corbettreport I'm the slow kid in the corner. I watched Big Oil docs. Are you saying man made global warming is a hoax ?
7965 2018-02-22 05:10:39 hot oil treatments and jamaican black castor oil!

7969 2018-02-22 05:10:17 Err, and wiping the oil out again after, I mean. Not just cooking some oil crud  :p
7970 2018-02-22 05:10:15 Can the Oil hire their PK coach?
7971 2018-02-22 05:10:03 You mean the fall forward? Yeah that one 
7972 2018-02-22 05:09:45 Dishwashing liquid directly on the stain then wash normally works for all my oil stains 
7973 2018-02-22 05:09:45 นี่ก็ชงจัง
7974 2018-02-22 05:09:32 That market glut of ARs and parts is about to evaporate. Sales are going to skyrocket. The ONLY way leftist ideology stimulates the economy.
7975 2018-02-22 05:09:27 Obama & Hillary's were both 4 selling weapons and fracking around the globe at the expense of humanity & planet, facilitated brutality against the indigenous of this country and around the globe by big oil, Wall St., the expansion of wars, bombing, surveillance and privatization
7976 2018-02-22 05:09:24 No... she's from Korea. These things originated as a South Korean snack food. Very popular. spread all around SE Asia. Now on your doorstep. this shit is awesome if you overlook the massive carb burst inherent in the combination of starches and frying oil.
7977 2018-02-22 05:09:22 Disappointing.
7978 2018-02-22 05:09:19 Putting some oil in and warming it up is useful when it's cruddy
7979 2018-02-22 05:09:18 You fake snake oil salesman!

7983 2018-02-22 05:08:28 give me a break... he has not supported dictatorship. The U.S. is just trying to overthrow that government for oil.
7984 2018-02-22 05:08:22 Like EPA Scott Pruitt--gotta fly first class so people won't challenge his raping our natural environment, polluting our air and giving away our public commons to his oil & gas cronies.

7988 2018-02-22 05:08:06 As a libertarian I’d assume (correct me if I’m wrong here) that he believes in self ownership, responsibility and preservation. Of which the right to defense is inseparable.  He’ll be a member by dawn.

8004 2018-02-22 05:05:03 They booed an NRA rep trying to use someone else's story for explotation purposes. Women who have weapons in those situations are sometimes in more danger if their attacker gains control of their weapon

8018 2018-02-22 05:02:28 Him saying no to that question would just mean the NRA would support the next guy. The real issue is changing campaign finance rules so that NOBODY can buy a politician and influence law. Not he NRA, tobacco, oil, planned parenthood.. NOBODY

8023 2018-02-22 05:01:57 This is getting comical...
8024 2018-02-22 05:01:51 More kids die in car accidents, it would make much more sense to raise the driving age than that of getting a gun.
Regardless, they’re totally ignoring the mental health aspect and forgetting that they’ll find a way no matter what you ban.
#gunsense #guncontrol #guncontrolnow
8025 2018-02-22 05:01:46 This is about intensification. All of us in every province are dependent on oil. We collectively need to reduce not intensify. That also applies to selling it to other nations who too have the same  responsibilities to reduce consumption. There’s only one side here, us.
8026 2018-02-22 05:01:46 Jus an old cowboy doing my thang and making a little jingle off the oil.

8028 2018-02-22 05:01:38 @petromatrix said the same yday. Everyone hates the "$-oil" story but there's no escaping it right now. Correlation is alive and well

8042 2018-02-22 05:00:16 I wish someone would have told me, how beautifully coconut oil works as an eye make up remover.
8043 2018-02-22 05:00:16 And that was before someone tried to greenwash it as “oil sands”.

8050 2018-02-22 04:59:41 So i spent $63 on a oil change today
8051 2018-02-22 04:59:27 Playing devil's advocate: Initially, coal energy was a seemingly infinite new source of energy. And then, oil was a seemingly infinite source of energy.

Are we naive enough to think solar will be any different?

8062 2018-02-22 04:57:42 Good for him but he needs to point that finger at all Congressional seats for the past 20 years and ask the question “How much has the NRA, BIG OIL/GAS, PHARMACEUTICALS, ect....donate to your bs campaign?
8063 2018-02-22 04:57:35 Kuwaiti oil price down 62 cents to USD 60.80 pb.
8064 2018-02-22 04:57:14 What the @NRA  should really be scared of is that no one is buying their snake oil anymore. They can trot out this person and she can talk their talking points, and not one single person in that room tonight believed her.

8068 2018-02-22 04:55:41 You're totally right! I mean what is to stop them from driving an oil tanker through the school or bring a bunch of pressure cooker bombs? Why would they stop at an AR-15, why not a fully automatic? You cant stop a terrorist from getting a weapon of sorts, just the good guys.

8098 2018-02-22 04:51:03 Wow, we have a senator here! Cool!

Senator, do you have any comments re the FBI and Broward Sheriff's Office failure to respond to the numerous reports they received about Nikolas Cruz?
Also, is it your intention to ban all semi-automatic firearms?

Thanks
8099 2018-02-22 04:50:59 Yep. Forget everything everybody says about social networking. This American generation DOES NOT CARE ABOUT CARS. That has to really bother the oil companies, right?

8117 2018-02-22 04:47:20 you don’t need an oven tray just wrap the heads in foil with a little olive oil in there with the heads
8118 2018-02-22 04:47:14 Note: You'll find mashgichim/kashrut supervisors insist on turning on the oven in restaurants is to avoid the prohibition of Bishul Akkum/the cooking of gentiles (though in my text the idiom is בישול גוים). Some require more participation e.g. adding oil #DafYomi 38a

8122 2018-02-22 04:46:35 Haha. Guapo goes NUTS when I put coconut oil on my hair hoping I spill/drop some. I give him a little teaspoon when I do my hair.
8123 2018-02-22 04:46:24 @StateDept you can redeploy @BobGodec to Venezuela. His experience in Tunisia and Kenya will help get oil tenders at the expense of citizens rights. He can assist the country's elections body with US fake promises.

8130 2018-02-22 04:44:54 Why are non-resource economies typically more democratic than resource economies?

Because oil & other resource economies typically have a more autonomous fiscal base, so governments can get away with being less accountable.

Not so in a democratic economy that just raised #VAT
8131 2018-02-22 04:44:53 A bit bemused to see #PalmOil is a trending topic today. If you want my thoughts: go sustainable palm oil. Yes, it's possible and less harmful than alternatives.

8146 2018-02-22 04:42:20 I'd hazard to guess that the Oil would have a few more wins this year if they played as hard as these girls
8147 2018-02-22 04:42:16 Alrighty, in an attempt to help my poor unfortunate hands to recover from how dry it is and that one burn I got a couple of months ago, I'm dousing them in almond oil until my skin gets over itself.

8252 2018-02-22 04:27:42 Congress is not owned by the NRA, that is a ridiculous statement to just push a narrative that is currently the hit topic. Owned? Let’s compare donations over the years to Pharmaceutical Companies, Defense Contractors, Oil Industry just to name a few. CNN is just a waste of time
8253 2018-02-22 04:27:41 Stop taking CAIR money, insurers, pharma, oil, Soros, Koch the list goes on with every politician. Maybe our politicians should get out of the fund raising business and Americans need to end lobbyist & change campaign finance. Politics is just a racketeering/embezzlement cabal.

8255 2018-02-22 04:27:28 Fed hikes Short Term Rates. $$ strengthens as foreign "hot money" inflows chase Yields. Drives down said Yields, at Long End. Countering Fed Policy.

8259 2018-02-22 04:27:00 It's 2018. The American Dream died a long time ago. It’s clear we will be governed by bigots and it won't change before Earth runs out of oil. Sit back, relax, mix yourself a drink or crack open a beer and choose your character. #midnightphilosophy #mortalcombat
8260 2018-02-22 04:26:59 Climate Barbie, pull your head out of your ass and instead of trying to cripple Canada’s economy with ill-conceived green policies, try working with the energy sector- you’ll find the strides our oil industry is taking to be more enviro- friendly will amaze you

8263 2018-02-22 04:26:34 No organization will outbid oil for rail cars and keep the grain marketable. To suggest otherwise is disingenuous at best, and outright shilling for collective bargaining using lies at worst.
8264 2018-02-22 04:26:32 The solution in my humble opinion  is to change how our government works.That way our interests will be paramount, and not:The NRA,big Pharma,big oil, healthcare industry.

8370 2018-02-22 04:10:32 2016 In an interview with The Washington Post, Trump identifies Carter Page and George Papadopoulos as two of his foreign policy advisers, referring to Papadopoulos by name as “an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy.”

8373 2018-02-22 04:10:16 Research says there is an allergic reaction happening during N. To certain laundry detergents, fabric softener in sheets, or old mattress? I had all 3 & it caused poor sleep. I was falling asleep the next day. Oil based face creams do the same.

8378 2018-02-22 04:09:40 why does trump this adding guns to schools is gonna stop violence that’s like starting an oil fire and then adding for fucking oil to the fire
8379 2018-02-22 04:09:35 You might want to take some fish oil with all that memory loss
8380 2018-02-22 04:09:30 2.) Having large liquids like shampoo bottles, coconut oil and etc cause them to do bag check. Try putting your plastic container in the place that even if your bag did get search that people wouldn’t think to look. In the side pocket balled up in some socks or sumn.
8381 2018-02-22 04:09:15 @LlysseWylle: I saw the video of your address to the West Virginia House, listing the members of the Judiciary Committee and the amount of money each of them received from the oil and gas industry.
You were cut short by the House leadership.
Please post the ENTIRE list!
Thanks!
8382 2018-02-22 04:09:11 Yeah, ouch. Glad no bones broke (seemingly).

8385 2018-02-22 04:08:44 Don't forget the snake oil salesmen and grifters.
8386 2018-02-22 04:08:43 At today's currency rates, the White Line Beard Oil = £10.78 (+ VAT & Shipping), whereas the Silver Line Beard Oil = £17.97 (+ VAT & Shipping). While it's certainly more expensive, it's not £20-£30 more. 

Maybe, I can share ideas to earn more income to make up the difference?
8387 2018-02-22 04:08:35 Yeah but in a few years your oil stock will stop being profitable and it will be too late to invest in companies that actually changes the standards...

Good things take time to make and by placing money to companies that tries to make a difference will actually do in a few years

8389 2018-02-22 04:07:41 It's not just the NRA. Big oil. The Koch's. Lobbyists destroying this country for personal gains. No respect for politicians but they are forced to take the money. If they don't then someone else will and they get kicked out of the game

8392 2018-02-22 04:07:25 Coconut oil is everything 
8393 2018-02-22 04:07:15 Well key is that Oilers need to take $ off the Senators plate, but in doing so much take care of at least part of their own cap issue. Oil get a RW for McD, and a franchise D...added to the remaining signed core (plus Nurse new deal) ..and then going only with youth.  Can it work
8394 2018-02-22 04:07:11 Had shingles summer 1998. Worst thing I've experienced. Couldn't eat, sleep, sit, stand..nothing. I was in tears from no sleep. Doc gave me Valtrex I think. I ran a tepid bath and poured in peppermint oil. Finally slept that night. Not fun. Get well Amanda

8398 2018-02-22 04:06:57 See, that’s what happens when you can’t think critically: you can’t keep up with the rest of us. Those of us who stay mentally sharp and aware of what’s going on around us; those who don’t buy Trumps snake oil and call it miracles. Your mental laziness has made you an easy mark.

8402 2018-02-22 04:06:31 No you didn't. If they are as smart as you claim, they will realize that progressives such as yourself. And Democrats are the biggest frauds, and snake oil salesmen ever

8404 2018-02-22 04:06:15 Well there you run into a problem because just like drug companies and big oil companies - it’s big business in America and the NRA wouldn’t let that happen.

8425 2018-02-22 04:03:37 You have to take into account the fact that the military not only does background checks and monitors mental health but also extensively trains on gun safety. An 18-year-old in the military does not equal an average high school student or dropout.

8428 2018-02-22 04:02:30 I probably wouldn’t do the coconut oil, especially if you have acne prone skin. It’s comedogenic, so it’ll clog your pores! I’ve read that it works for some people, but there are several skin type factors that play into that. But for most people, it just makes acne worse.

8434 2018-02-22 04:02:10 Well pump it until it goes down to a 1$/per gallon.  Hahaha.  it's possible to enjoy low gas prices while believing in safe extraction of oil and availability of  alternative energy resources. I miss the @BarackObama  cheap gas price era. Hopefully it's coming back...
8435 2018-02-22 04:02:01 I know the oil is good for my hair rn because she's been through a lot lately and I do have to wash my hair less frequently but feeling like my hair is greasy makes me want to die

8437 2018-02-22 04:01:08 @DanWetzel  (Little secret. Tim's coffee tastes like ... motor oil. But like all the radicalized political folks out there, we'll never admit it and will remain firmly entrenched in our position and YOU'RE WRONG)

8440 2018-02-22 04:00:45 Mine are a solution with canola oil, yes. But how we do it is an 18 gauge (big, piercing thickness) to pull it into the syringe, but then switching to a much thinner 25 gauge to inject that I honestly barely feel going in at all.
8441 2018-02-22 04:00:32 How about oil?
8442 2018-02-22 04:00:22 Whoa, we are fighting them. Bring your money here! No oil wells off of NC! And there won’t be, once we vote out the GOP with the #BlueWave2018!

8445 2018-02-22 03:59:56 I think what could make it work is Oil taking 1/2 of Luc $, but getting a conditional #1 if they don't resign EK.  I'm not in the mood to sketch out how much Oil cap left to fill roster, but that would be interesting.
8446 2018-02-22 03:59:35 I can’t even oil my whole head white these box braids I need help and my mom isn’t here

8449 2018-02-22 03:59:05 I’m not saying it’s gonna happen in a year but it’s by investing in the futur that new technology will emerge and btw there’s more than oil and nuclear; look at Quebec 80% or more of the energy produced is from hydroelectricity
Big changes aren’t for lazy people it takes efforts
8450 2018-02-22 03:59:01 I cook my pizzas by dousing them in olive oil and then lighting them on fire.

I'm not working in an oil field or a bank or a corrupted cop shop or corrupted government office etc

In late 1980's, he wrote a book predicting that Japanese were just about to absolutely dominate the entire world economically . . . just before their stock market crashed and Japan never regained influence.  Still a pundit

8485 2018-02-22 03:53:17 I agree. Sometimes we give so much attention to conspiracy theories. Besides, even if it is Muhammad, it can be any Muhammad, not our Noble Prophet SAW. A name like that won't hurt him, nor us. He is already great and will forever be.

8488 2018-02-22 03:52:45 Shame on you. American and Russian and other oil billionaires are still billionaires after we all stop using fossile fuels. But if we don't stop using fossil fuels our (as all the people) world is fucked and billions of people starve as world turns into a dust bowl.

Woody's Restaurant,Bengaluru.
Will try to send the cook by AC Car if you wish.
The taste is good,however we wanted Vegetable Oil with the same quality as the year 2000 at Woody's.

8522 2018-02-22 03:47:03 Black mirror episode: very intense battle with suspicious motives rly ramping up the mystery of the fight.

Why they are fighting is revealed:whoever loses has to clean the pan of oil I burnt on the oven for 2 hours which looks like death
8523 2018-02-22 03:46:49 Oil in lifeの余韻に浮かれてて、なぜかハッピーファンシベビードール♪ラブリーファンシベビードールいぇい♪とか言いながら階段踏み外してダダダっとな……我ながらひどいと思ったネ。
8524 2018-02-22 03:46:48 Girl, you gotta grillem with olive oil and seasonings. Makes veggies fantastic
8525 2018-02-22 03:46:42 I need more Neutrogena body oil.
8526 2018-02-22 03:46:41 I just had bread and oil for dinner. 

How's your Wednesday going?
8527 2018-02-22 03:46:26 Public testimony: by the time any of this oil will be online, we need to have moved beyond fossil fuel extraction.
8528 2018-02-22 03:46:25 Doesn't everyone say "ole" instead of oil 
8529 2018-02-22 03:46:14 i need baby oil thanks
8530 2018-02-22 03:46:14 There's no conversation there without Karlson signing a new deal with Oil. I would move our 1st rounder + Klef for him though.

8534 2018-02-22 03:45:43 I'm not saying any of that BUT research says there is an allergic reaction happening during N. To certain laundry detergent, fabric softener in sheets, or old mattress? I had all 3 & it caused poor sleep. I was falling asleep the next day. Oil based face creams do the same.
8535 2018-02-22 03:45:34 this is the first time ive procrastinated so hard that im going to write a paper the morning that its due. do i care? nope! its about olive oil and nothing is real
8536 2018-02-22 03:45:20 Oil changes and a plate of food for $5?????
8537 2018-02-22 03:45:19 @narendramodi if you do not eliminate your political enemies, they will not only eliminate you,they will also destroy the country. Very disappointed with you in this regard.

8538 2018-02-22 03:45:11 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
8539 2018-02-22 03:45:04 felt like eating oil kaso wala ka choice... Mama! mapuli ko, lutoe ko food
8540 2018-02-22 03:44:38 Where are @SenSanders, Sean Penn and the rest of Hollywood leftists who think socialist is such a success? Venezuela produces a lot of oil. How can this happen?
8541 2018-02-22 03:44:31 Yeah, why talk about those pesky women issues like family planning and reproductive rights? Let's talk about something like sweaty coal miners or oil field rough necks - something Tillerson is comfortable with. That woman stuff really makes him nervous.
8542 2018-02-22 03:44:26 i’m back ack ack again to tell y’all that the marilyn hot oil treatment from lush is EVERYTHING not only is my hair soft as fuck but it removed so much brassiness from my hair that it’s almost a whole shade lighter like wow

8545 2018-02-22 03:44:02 The Oilers do need to do more work at D. Sekera is a huge wild card, hasn’t been the same since his injury... future also seems unclear... (feeling like Ference 2.0). All I know is the Oil need 2 players on D for immediate help... E. Bear 1 year away, Laleggia good 7th
8546 2018-02-22 03:43:57 Taking time out tonight for a little science, I successfully mastered how to have scented and colored oil float on top of water. To scent and color the oil without that joining the water was the thinking part. 

Then I did it. Essential oil for scent; oil-based dye. Boom!
8547 2018-02-22 03:43:44 HI Ashley, great snapshot. You do incredible professional work. Do you photograph concerts? Looking for a stand-in, and a top-notch liberal to document the urban oil crises east of Narragansett. Feel free to drop me a parachute, and a corkscrew. Otherwise enjoyable. Cheers. TM

CONCENTRATED GRAPESEED OIL IS AMAAAAZING FOR TATTOO HEALING!! it’s known for its natural moisturizing abilities & is great for anyone who wants anything that’s 100% purely natural (:(:
8549 2018-02-22 03:43:39 Me in high school: I MUST have the longest hair and I must wash it every single day! The slightest bit of oil is UNACCEPTABLE!!! 
Me now: I cannot bear to wash my hair more than once a week and as soon as it hits past my shoulders just euthanize me
8550 2018-02-22 03:43:37 This has been going on for more than 5 years...chemical weapons used on civilians is one of among many of the violations...yet the UN n world leaders r too busy in diplomacy n resolutions n committees to take any real positive concrete action...too bad Syria didn’t have oil
8551 2018-02-22 03:43:34 What kinda oil we talkin???

8569 2018-02-22 03:41:55 LifeStyle: Another one of the important health benefits of cashew nuts is that cashews can improve the health of your heart. Most of the fat that cashews contain is the same healthy, oleic acid that is found in olive oil.
8570 2018-02-22 03:41:49 @TommyAhlquist what is your stance on legalizing marijuana in the state of Idaho as governor? Not recreational, only medical marijuana or CBD oil for physical and mental health issues only.

8572 2018-02-22 03:41:31 My sister gave me so many skin products because she doesn’t use skin oil, hyaluronic acid, eye creams, face toner, etc. I didn’t even question her bc I was afraid she would want them back 
8573 2018-02-22 03:41:23 Lmao. That oil deep doesn’t mean it’s a high enough grade or in economic quantities.
8574 2018-02-22 03:41:16 @DLoesch very brave of you to do what you are doing tonight.  Rock and hard place. Why can’t everyone see what the real issue is?

8585 2018-02-22 03:40:33 There’s nothing better than taking a long hot shower after a day of getting oil splattered all over your body.

This is winning bigly! Heia Norge!

8651 2018-02-22 03:32:50 Just super diff behavior compared to PB. Those spreads are primarily sugar with liquid oil, whereas nut butter is pure protein and solid fat, so they aren’t really in the same family of ingredients to make a swap.

8653 2018-02-22 03:32:36 I still don’t get why the gubment so hot up for oil... clean energy is where it’s at
8654 2018-02-22 03:32:34 Aside from the likely bias of your followers, don’t they know they wouldn’t be forced to carry guns? Also, we had a shortage of oil until we found more.

8659 2018-02-22 03:32:01 Im definitely not! Love coconut oil...I use it to cook, I use it as a body moisturizer and in all my body scrubs and it’s an excellent hair moisturizer ! I even give a tablespoon to my dogs when they have an upset tummy & it’s great for their coat!

8672 2018-02-22 03:30:22 lol its a homemade pizza dough you shape it round fry it on top of stove in oil you can put on it what you want sauce,cheese,peppers takes only 45 minutes to rise then make them they are so good
8673 2018-02-22 03:30:20 Dana Loesch from the NRA is like the woman the oil company sends to your house to tell you that your water isn't poison.
8674 2018-02-22 03:30:11 I have friends who's kids were able to get find good work at the oil sands which turned their lives around. They are a few of 1000's who have benefited, but the rest of Canada slams OS all the same. We need the pipeline.
8675 2018-02-22 03:30:10 Haha. I pernah sekali clogged pores lepas pakai face oil.. Gatal sgt nk pakai face oil mungkin lembap elok je.. esok nye naik tiny bumps. Sah! Pori2ku tersumbat..   nuxe dry oil tu bau dia best sangat.. skrg apply dkt leher je sbb fragrant tak elok kan dkt muka.. 
8676 2018-02-22 03:29:41 I LOVE them! But I use caution when using them around my baby since there are few studies in regards to the Essential Oil safety w/ babies. And they are toxic to cats, so I try to prevent exposure to my little calico.

8683 2018-02-22 03:28:18 I like the curls creme brulee moisturizer .. with an oil.. I wet my hair and apply it .. I like flexy rods and also normal twist outs are cool but I can’t make mine last and plus my hair gets dry lol ..Cantu curling cream or curl activator is good too
8684 2018-02-22 03:28:18 So, if it turns out that any of our left-wing environmental groups colluded with foreign oil producers (they ALL do) to impact American energy policy, will indictments be handed down?

8689 2018-02-22 03:27:36 The spray is just bottled water & lavender oil. You spray the affected area with it first then put the ointment on. I recommend using it everyday to prevent eczema breakouts but it also treats flare ups pretty fast
8690 2018-02-22 03:27:28 Can’t see a trend there hey. The whole budget issue is just NDP. Has nothing to do with plunging oil price or lack of spending previously on infrastructure? Just all Rachel hey?
8691 2018-02-22 03:27:15 Vaseline, black organic soap, tea tree oil, coconut oil. (What i use).
8692 2018-02-22 03:27:08 Awesome idea, let’s start working towards that today starting with protecting this critically sensitive ecosystem from increased oil tanker traffic increased spill risk and plastics floating in our oceans.
8693 2018-02-22 03:26:50 $2.20?  I would pump extra on the ground because I would feel bad for the oil companies loosing so much money.

8696 2018-02-22 03:26:22 Either one is fine, it might be pricey if you don’t have the ingredients already. But it’s unrefined raw she’s butter, unrefined raw virgin coconut oil, vitamin e oil, lavender oil, chamomile oil, jojoba oil & finely grated oats. You simmer it on low & package to let harden

8707 2018-02-22 03:25:12 Of course it sucks, it's absolutely LUDICROUS that Federal Law still regards such a safe, effective medicine as something criminal.  LEGAL CBD oil has the promise of helping thousands, if not millions!

8709 2018-02-22 03:24:36 For me, it’s not about the pipeline but rather what comes after Westridge and the increase in oil tankers and the risk of oil spills in a critically sensitive ecosystem.
8710 2018-02-22 03:24:23 Hoiii Clifford needs an oil change, alignment, a new tire and then we need to do the inspection & renew the damn stickers. I just want to sell him & get some flying powers or something lol
8711 2018-02-22 03:24:20 @HCJustinn  Cooking oil temp: what I do is put a table spoon of olive oil in the pan and heat it up on medium until it starts to smoke a little, then turn it down a bit and put the rest of my oil in. Olive oil smokes at around 400F. Hope that helps.
8712 2018-02-22 03:24:18 I need some head that's going to make me lock up like an engine with no oil 
8713 2018-02-22 03:24:14 No friggn way , not one more dime . Go sell your snake oil else where because we are not buying and we are definitely not for sale . We need to take to the streets to stop this insanity now. We need recall legislation.
8714 2018-02-22 03:24:12 I've been taking a modest daily dose of (Finally LEGAL!) CBD oil for a couple weeks now, and it's had a very positive effect. It greatly helps me attain near-complete peace of mind, at least when I'm not otherwise frenzied with necessary work and household tasks.
8715 2018-02-22 03:24:05 Took some of our oil from church and poured it in my kids shoes they wear to school, and placed pieces of the red ribbon in them.

8763 2018-02-22 03:16:56 I've been wondering about this. Do you think maybe they are compiling a soup, albeit very slowly? I would remove the vegetables from the sock (use later maybe for bouquet garni). Dice onion, sweat in olive oil. Add other veg, stock etc.
8764 2018-02-22 03:16:51 There is no “promise”, only confusion: Petro is backed by oil but is not exchangeable in oil (obviously). It can be exchanged in bolívares or other cryptos by the Venezuelan state though (procedure tbd)

8781 2018-02-22 03:14:19 I have destroyed my room and I cannot find my coconut oil anywhere
8782 2018-02-22 03:14:08 Except they barely donate.  Big oil gives much more.
8783 2018-02-22 03:14:03 We finally have something in common.
8784 2018-02-22 03:13:45 Thank you! After reviewing the link provided, I now see that the republic credits are similar to the the new Venezuelan Petro cryptocurrency. However, instead of being backed by Oil, it is backed by the republic wealth.  With transactions still immutably stored on the blockchain.
8785 2018-02-22 03:13:37 The rosehip seed oil broke me out pretty bad too. I guess it depends on your skin because I see a lot of people use it with no problem

Back in my early days at my job, somebody forgot to leave the fryer off long enough to not make the oil drain pipe not burning hot after emptying a pot's worth

8802 2018-02-22 03:10:41 What the NRA donates to political funds is a drop in the bucket compared to pharma/oil/banks. Their power is in that they represent american gun owners.

8807 2018-02-22 03:10:20 I don’t think oil and gas industry can be blamed for solar panels not being covered in that 1% of the land (This 1% thing still needs fact check), homeowners r free to install solar panels, why r they not spread like wildfire...issues.

8818 2018-02-22 03:08:44 My roommate just rubbed his dirty hands all over my face and why am I cringing. There was a fresh layer of coconut oil over this face. I just did the 3627254 steps to get it ready for bed 
8819 2018-02-22 03:08:37 I think we can't connect b/c I read/watch real events and you read/watch Fox, Breitbart, Infowars. Oil & water. 2 different languages. I'm done   no more    just go away
8820 2018-02-22 03:08:36 Speaking of this weekend I HAVE to get a oil change... and if it's nice wash my car.
8821 2018-02-22 03:08:24 People do know that the NRA accounts for my be 1% of any given politician's donations?  And studies have shown that the 1% has no bearing on how they vote for gun laws.  Try Google.  Big oil is by far the biggest campaign doner.

8856 2018-02-22 03:04:37 The Third Industrial Revolution by Jeremy Rifkin is fascinating. How can we progress when we're all plugged into a revolution formed by oil & gas. I agree were on the verge of third, seeing incredibly efficient energy systems, transportation and communication. Well worth a watch.
8857 2018-02-22 03:04:36 That oil is being shipped outside Canada, and is produced more cleanly than other sources. Building the pipeline creates buy-in for vital policies like the carbon tax.

8862 2018-02-22 03:03:40 With all due respect, a cousin works in finance for Statoil the government run oil company & they have controlled production for 40 yrs & saved 75% yearly. Do the math for a country of 5.3m people who aren’t ostentatious, they will survive for years with just measured production.
8863 2018-02-22 03:03:34 You’re a quitter. Free trade of oil via pipelines? East? West? North? Not likely. But south? Of course. That’s what you’re about-being an American. You and your ilk don’t have the fortitude to do anything on your own.

8867 2018-02-22 03:02:55 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

8900 2018-02-22 02:58:34 It’s only gone down in the last two years up until the price of oil collapsed resources as a percent gdp was going up

8944 2018-02-22 02:51:45 Are you joking we’ve actually reduced diversification. Unless you count construction in oil and gas as a separate industry.
8945 2018-02-22 02:51:44 OALP visited the Panama Canal this afternoon. It takes 26 million gallons of water for each transition. We saw several ships pass through. One with wheat, one with oil, and one with 5,000 autos.

8952 2018-02-22 02:50:30 I always have mine checked or replaced with an oil change. Speaking of CHANGE, when are you going to move to an ad campaign that does NOT include #Bullying and #Negativity ? SO tired of having to mute during the Olympics etc.

8968 2018-02-22 02:46:39 Yes, WW2 did not really need to last as long in Europe. This particular terminal/train caused Eisenhower to ask Patton 2 find out who did it. Patton never found out, but had given orders to blow up any trains hauling American Oil. Uhmm

8971 2018-02-22 02:45:50 If you’re a parent. And you’ve ever had a constipated child, and given them drops of Olive Oil you KNOW the scary after effect
8972 2018-02-22 02:45:46 Combine 2 1/2 pints Irish stew with 9 oz edimame. Mix into  Olive Oil. Roast. Serve for brunch
8973 2018-02-22 02:45:30 Can you imagine trying that shit in a country like Nigeria? There'd be 100s of mini ethno states all competing for the South's oil
8974 2018-02-22 02:45:29 If Canada meets GHG targets and stops all oil production, oh hell, if we no longer exist,
will climate change stop or even slow significantly? I don't need a morality lesson either.
8975 2018-02-22 02:45:27 In Oregon you have to be 21 to buy cigarettes but not to buy an assault weapon. I guess we know who owns more politicians... Raise the age for all adult things to 21, (smoking, drinking, gun ownership & serving in oil grabbing wars)
8976 2018-02-22 02:45:07 Saudi Arabia flourished with the help of oil & USA but Japan made it's path on the most difficult time's with almost no natural wealth so they know better Value possessions.
8977 2018-02-22 02:44:56 If India wants to interfere in Canadian politics, support Alberta separatists - at least Alberta has oil and gas to sell.

8980 2018-02-22 02:44:21 Thank you Mother Nature for this small cash windfall! 76° here in MA meant heat stayed off - no oil used. 
8981 2018-02-22 02:43:51 DEMOLITION JOB BY THE SOYBEAN CARTEL. Coconut oil is the healthiest vegetable oil on God’s earth. Americans are grossly obese precisely due to unsaturated and hydrogenated fats. WAKE UP!!!
8982 2018-02-22 02:43:44 What kind of oil
8983 2018-02-22 02:43:36 Geez @NHLbyMatty if he hates continual losing and you think Oil are in the equation. Do you watch the Oilers? Have you been alive last 15 years?
8984 2018-02-22 02:43:32 Baby oil smooth boiiiiii 
8985 2018-02-22 02:43:23 so my car leaks power steering, oil, a/c, and transmission... but i have breaks again. 
8986 2018-02-22 02:43:13 I use the spray olive oil and it’s definitely an improvement but still more effort than I would like (that is to say, any effort at all)

8997 2018-02-22 02:41:37 This is why I call it snake oil. They have convinced you that if you lick the boots of the rich, that you will be given liberty. No liberty awaits you in that transaction. They have sold you a bridge to nowhere. You will not get rich and the rich do not care about you.

9003 2018-02-22 02:40:17 I feel sorry for you that you don't understand the connection between ppl and our planet. Who mourn polluted air, oil soaked wildlife, clearcut forests, poisoned water, & the ppl who don't get it.

9010 2018-02-22 02:38:52 The thing about Venezuela is that their massive reserves are easier to mine/ more economically viable than the oil sands of Alberta, that is why certain companies want back in there, so badly
9011 2018-02-22 02:38:29 I officially despair for America. Its the corruption of politicians. Corporate money and greed runs the country. How can you trust any politician who is taking money from NRA/OIL/WALLST/etc. You can't. They go with the money. You cant get rid of guns. This is why.

9017 2018-02-22 02:37:28 Leon is a 5on5 beast that should be a story. Instead it’s why can’t he carry his own line (neglecting the fact his wingers both haven’t scored in over 20games). Leon is so offensively gifted. When don’t talk about it enough because he’s overshadowed by 97

9019 2018-02-22 02:37:19 Girllllllllllll then I get home, check my account and be like "did I really need all this? 5 bottles of baby oil is a bit much........but I won't have to go back for a while.......yep it was worth it"
9020 2018-02-22 02:37:16 I usually end up reapplying the oil every 2 to 3 hours, so not too bad 
9021 2018-02-22 02:37:07 In Nigeria, a ship loaded with oil went missing, a satellite disappeared into thin air, 10 dead people were appointed as Heads of Boards by the President, the National Budget was alleged to be missing, a snake was said to have swallowed missing N36m & now a monkey swallowed N70m.
9022 2018-02-22 02:37:05 Hi Jeanan. Old two scoops is a flin flon man. A snake oil salesman who’s best ability was to bully people when he was in real estate. I’m not even sure if he would flinch if one of his own kids were hurt. Have you even seen him hug any of them. Oh wait, besides Ivanka.

9025 2018-02-22 02:36:42 Thank you. But really was aiming for a thought on this veggie fruit no oil diet crap that bill Clinton is now out pushing. No fat= heart attack proof
9026 2018-02-22 02:36:09 Bro just vape yr weed or vape oil carts. You don't deserve woods. 
9027 2018-02-22 02:35:59 Oil and water always separate
9028 2018-02-22 02:35:56 How sad & they have all that oil.
9029 2018-02-22 02:35:45 I would definitely search out another surgeon, depending on where you live. I know on the East Coast Dr Seckin is in New York and Atlanta has an endometriosis center. Anti-inflammatory diet and CBD oil can also help.
9030 2018-02-22 02:35:44 And I have SUPER sensitive skin, anything from the drug store - I can’t use. I mostly just use micellar water and Palmer’s skin oil on days I don’t wear make up.
9031 2018-02-22 02:35:37 Sadly that's not age...it's parental upbringing. The Apple doesn't fall far from the tree
9032 2018-02-22 02:35:32 Moana was just ightt... I’m not gonna hold you she ain’t have the 90s early 2000s Disney princess oil.
9033 2018-02-22 02:35:02 420 and peppermint oil on the area that’s most painful. Use as needed 
9034 2018-02-22 02:34:57 Don’t know about the Russians, but the Chinese launched an oil contract priced in yuan that can be swapped for gold. That yellow stuff is helpful if you’re under sanctions.
9035 2018-02-22 02:34:50 Perhaps but that's never been my angle. I look at it  like this. If  Leon finishes with 70ish pts but 20ish fewer PP points, doesn't mean he naturally finishes w/ 90+ pts next yr. It's all tied together and things change b/c of it.
9036 2018-02-22 02:34:12 @bp22 what did u do with ur oil position

9041 2018-02-22 02:32:34 you try a new brand of toothpaste. upon applying some to your toothbrush you notice it looks like oil and moves like mercury. it demands to be put in your mouth. s w a l l o w, h u m a n
9042 2018-02-22 02:32:18 It does not sound like you "overcame" any indoctrination. It sounds like you did not understand the ideologies involved very well to begin with and then got sold the snake oil of capitalism. Your mundane examples of political distress only enforce that impression.
9043 2018-02-22 02:32:15 Not because he's good or anything. He's slick alright, like a snake oil salesman.

9077 2018-02-22 02:27:37 The argan and coconut oil locks it in so it should work. Also try any shea moisture, Cantu products, even look up methods to define your curls more

9084 2018-02-22 02:26:53 Trump cut the legs off the Russian economy by allowing US to drill for more  oil. Hopefully, it will also kill the Iranian economy. Europe should be kissing Trumps feet.
9085 2018-02-22 02:26:20 Trump admires Putin. Putin causes opposition to disappear, sometimes by poison. Poisoned former opposition leader in Ukraine. Poisoned BP Oil exec who stood in way of Russian takeover. Hmmm...Trump is afraid of being poisoned... hang with the wrong guys makes you paranoid Donnie.
9086 2018-02-22 02:26:16 More like a snake oil salesman. #charlatan

9089 2018-02-22 02:25:42 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
9090 2018-02-22 02:25:35 You gotta get a c boost & take a shower with eucalyptus oil ... I honestly feel 100% right now 
9091 2018-02-22 02:25:25 Stands for having your pp QB (97) stand on right side instead of left side elimination almost all one-timers hoping a lane opens up for the one right handed shot 
9092 2018-02-22 02:25:11 I am going to my first Oil Kings game on Sunday.
9093 2018-02-22 02:25:10 I was using coco butter when I was pregnant and it didn’t do anything  now I’ve been using Burt’s bees vitamin e oil and I think they’re some what lighter but not the way I want them lol

9096 2018-02-22 02:24:53 Why does Walmart oil change take forever 
9097 2018-02-22 02:24:40 Haa, kalau mcm kulit muka hg x sensitif dgn apa2 ingredients tu okayy. Kalau mcm hg dpt detect muka hg sensitif dgn oil seed cnthnya hg kena cari produk yg xdak bnda tu.

9098 2018-02-22 02:24:32 probably greased up in coconut oil.
9099 2018-02-22 02:24:31 Poor oil. Under such attack these days.
9100 2018-02-22 02:24:30 As if the roads weren't bad enough already, and think of the gas mileage. Oh, wait, that means more money for private road builders and oil companies; it's a winner all around!

1 new 'chungi' on NH709A, karnal is wrecking havoc.Regular 10km standstill jam on each side, 1 hr stretched to 3 hrs.
Precious manhours & tons of oil wasted + pollution.
Business suffers. 
#easeofdoingbusiness
9103 2018-02-22 02:24:10 Lowkey want to try oil paint again but highkey hate that shiiiiitt
9104 2018-02-22 02:24:10 I don't think Trump or the NRA care about children. Looks like a snake oil salesman giving his pitch, "it will save children!" but really?
That's a lot of teachers. 
That's a lot of guns. 
That's a lot of money.

9107 2018-02-22 02:23:40 No dude, Not just you! I forgot to bring my de-frizz oil too so my hair was awful in Paris.  Now that I'm home my hair is so soft and silky looking ITS INSANE
9108 2018-02-22 02:23:34 Future Jamaica if the oil discovery actually develops into something big and is managed properly
9109 2018-02-22 02:23:34 Obama/Hillary collusion with Al Nusra & other "moderate terrorists" attacking Syria is well known. Russia defended Syria who housed their only naval base in the Med & critical oil/gas infrastructure. Not to mention the Ukraine psyop. But that's all ok and not "seeking influence"?
9110 2018-02-22 02:23:33 I fucking HATE my skin tone it’s so hard to draw with oil pastel I want to sCREAM
9111 2018-02-22 02:23:27 Ironic that the “Trump is LITERALLY Hitler” crowd is now demanding top down, executive action regardless of elected officials’ stances on this issue. Seems vaguely Hitlerian...
9112 2018-02-22 02:23:24 I used coconut oil as a makeup remover and now my face is covered in a rash #funtimes
9113 2018-02-22 02:23:22 Does PP stand for ‘predictable perimeter passing’?
9114 2018-02-22 02:23:10 Medicinal marijuana is "renewable" and a multi billion dollar industry... and we really need to get our act together. 

Now word is spreading that our island is seeping oil. All these game changers.
Hope when the cards are laid out. Jamaica chooses wisely.
9115 2018-02-22 02:23:00 Oh so every other country that minds their own business is complicit in mass murder? Nice got it. It’s a sham, it’s in order to get over there, set up American businesses and steal oil + more under the ruse of “setting up democracy”

9117 2018-02-22 02:22:51 "Eliminating oil in the long run" how do we get there? Pretending it doesn't exist while billions is imported from dirty producers like Nigeria? Tomorrow's dreams do nothing for today's realities. Fun to posture though right? How much GHG do the tankers delivering your gas emit?
9118 2018-02-22 02:22:41 Put almond oil in my bath water and my skin is silkyyyyyy smoooothhh honey 
9119 2018-02-22 02:22:26 Sounds like you’re trying to ignore them
9120 2018-02-22 02:22:23 Get interested in developing America Africa will come out on its own .how many years u.s.a is in Africa? Show me any developments if only not interested in oil!!
9121 2018-02-22 02:22:22 I just googled tea tree oil and now I need GALLONS of it right away!!
9122 2018-02-22 02:22:21 Foods containing trans fats are primarily in processed foods made with trans fat from partially hydrogenated oil. #BadCholesterol #LDL
9123 2018-02-22 02:22:09 It's not just them. "Big pharma", "oil and gas", "defense contractors" are all terms that come up regularly when people bitch about lobbying, in addition to the NRA.
9124 2018-02-22 02:21:52 So what did he do to her? Nothing
9125 2018-02-22 02:21:47 I’m not that confident in that
9126 2018-02-22 02:21:46 Of course not but when you are as bad on special teams as this team has been, goals are going to come from somewhere. Law of averages.
9127 2018-02-22 02:21:42 Essential oil lovers unite! Having a get together this Friday to share and learn:)

9133 2018-02-22 02:21:15 @bulletproofexec This is a good one! "Coconut flakes are a good alternative to pouring coconut oil in your mug—we’re looking at you, bulletproof coffee lovers. The American Heart Association advises limiting coconut oil due to its high levels of saturated fat" VIA @PreventionMag
9134 2018-02-22 02:21:04 I love the smell of tea tree oil
9135 2018-02-22 02:20:56 Higher oil prices is a tax on ALL low income consumers, regardless of education level.  High paying oil & gas extraction jobs represent a tiny fraction of available job opportunities.  Net net, disparate impact.
9136 2018-02-22 02:20:49 @Oil_Ranger Following you now if you could please follow me back.  Thank you.
9137 2018-02-22 02:20:47 Talbots had a bad year, nobody can argue that.  I think he'll be back to last year's numbers (or close to) next year.
9138 2018-02-22 02:20:47 Better we never find no oil
9139 2018-02-22 02:20:40 Arrghhh!  We kill wildlife in so many selfish human ways. Biggest? Maybe oil spills drilling fracking & burning? And they are killing the indigenous indigent brown & black people AND the poor of all colors including whites.  #WTF? Money and power are vicious greedy forces -

9144 2018-02-22 02:20:05 How Ezra, a man sued for libel multiple times, made a snake oil store disguised as journalism will always baffle and enrage me.
9145 2018-02-22 02:19:55 Desperate stuff. I'm not a Corbynista, but if you think this is going to save MayBot, I've got a bridge to sell you and a gallon of snake oil.
9146 2018-02-22 02:19:46 Oiler fans (Not all) turn on everyone having an off year.  It's an ugly truth.  Instead of pumping a guy up, they crucify him.

9151 2018-02-22 02:19:12 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
9152 2018-02-22 02:19:04 Embarrassing....
9153 2018-02-22 02:19:02 The prospect of oil doesn't sound bad at all...I just hope that if we should strike black gold that the people feel the benefits and not only a select few #infrastructure #education #healthcare #reintroduction

9158 2018-02-22 02:18:42 Vitriolic Eileen is your real name-a NASTY WOMAN! Your olive oil is too good for you. You should switch to margarine- it matches your phony constitution, and one hopes it will do wonders to your wicked heart.
9159 2018-02-22 02:18:17 I made dinner with sesame oil. Turns out I don’t like sesame oil. 

Peanut butter toast for dinner!
9160 2018-02-22 02:18:14 Yes, I read up on the palm oil issue with WWF. We do what we can.
9161 2018-02-22 02:18:13 I’ve actually cancelled my bc vacation this year. Heard from lots of guys here doing the same. First time in 15 years I won’t be going there with my family. We wouldn’t want to offend any BC people with our dirty oil money. Sandpoint will have it instead. You’re welcome.
9162 2018-02-22 02:18:06 Oil ang gas sector ke?

9165 2018-02-22 02:17:50 Dont think it's needed, he waited & worked a long time to get to this spot. Wasn't trying to suggest you were but the masses have certainly turned on 33.

9171 2018-02-22 02:16:57 What is one of the most successful green countries with social programs better than Canada? Norway. How do they beat their kyoto mandates and lead green tech? Investing in and selling their hydrocarbons. Know statoil? Best approach 4 resource rich Canada. Or import conflict oil.
9172 2018-02-22 02:16:56 @Sephora I ordered the @theouai to Go kit and the hair oil had opened up and leaked all over the inside. Could someone please help? I bought for a trip and am leaving Friday!

9178 2018-02-22 02:15:50 Listen weasel Weaver where do you think our prosperity is coming from it sure as hell ain’t from electric cars why are we selling our oil to America and they selling it for a profit?

9180 2018-02-22 02:15:33 If you haven't built up an immunity to what your kids are sharing ... here's my germ-fighting secret. I take an oregano oil gel cap once a day, every day, from September to May. Oregano oil is a natural antibiotic. Stay healthy step moms!
9181 2018-02-22 02:15:27 Every rise in crude oil prices will be reflected in the retail prices of petrol, diesel and LPG, with no thought given to the alternative of cutting excise duties on these petroleum products or bringing them under the GST.

9184 2018-02-22 02:15:11 There are other ways that are more impactful than sanctions. We have increased our out put of oil and gas depressing prices that hurt Russia in the pocket book. Expanding and fully funding our military really pissed off Putin. Think broader.

9197 2018-02-22 02:12:49 So there are people who want to buy the Venezuelan oil futures, but are blocked from doing so as a result of sanctions, and are willing to break the law and evade those sanctions using a cryptocurrency made only for this purpose. Seems unlikely.

“Oh look! Some black sludge in the ground! I’m rich!!!”
9225 2018-02-22 02:08:34 Maybe the revolution jamaica so badly needs will come when we see how the politicians dem sell off the oil, say it loss and we some how even worse in debt.

9230 2018-02-22 02:08:07 Let me guess.  You didn't want to become an oil painter or a dancer.
9231 2018-02-22 02:07:47 Top5 goals for and goals against 5on5 sounds like a decent line up. Be better during special teams
9232 2018-02-22 02:07:28 So, why is fish-free important to you? (My vitamin pack has a fish oil capsule. Genuinely curious about why you're opposed to taking them.)
9233 2018-02-22 02:07:25 Lol they found oil in Jamaica? That's a curse really. We're fucked
9234 2018-02-22 02:07:17 特に寒いって訳でもないんだけど、灯油が１缶残ってるのを使い切らなくてはいけないって言われてストーブ点けてるんですが、それなりに部屋が地獄みたいな暑さ。地獄まだ行ったことないけど。
9235 2018-02-22 02:06:59 I have my music, art, and oil disfusser. I'm thinking lavender essential oil tonight. A bih need to relax. For reals.
9236 2018-02-22 02:06:52 Nah, for real tho. Is Tosha aka Yung Jojoba Oil drunk? Somebody check on her.
9237 2018-02-22 02:06:44 I told my Dad that Billy Graham died this morning, and he told me how he met the manager of Midnight Oil on one of those Billy Graham crusades, when Billy came to Australia.
9238 2018-02-22 02:06:38 Going to get my oil changed! :)
9239 2018-02-22 02:06:34 Haha u wont even let me say that the guys wrong? I go to pray in gurudwara. Nobody is preaching khalistan. I hv never seen one. I think u have too much oil on that shiny crome dome  and sense reflects back.
9240 2018-02-22 02:06:27 I use jojoba oil to wash my face and it’s great
9241 2018-02-22 02:06:24 Oil isn't going to sustain your country for long. Venezuela produced massive amounts of oil. How are they doing? And no, you don't have money for 100 years. At least every major global investor seems to think you don't. But maybe you know better than them.
9242 2018-02-22 02:06:05 Essential Oils + Your Vacuum Cleaner!! =>  Add a few drops of your favorite oil. Maybe Lavender or Frankincense #healthcoach #essentialoils
9243 2018-02-22 02:06:02 Bones don’t turn to oil
9244 2018-02-22 02:05:46 Oil change this weekend
9245 2018-02-22 02:05:36 @Toyota I might purchase my 1st ever Toyota tomorrow. Was wondering if using synthetic oil in my new(er) 2017 Camry SE would cause many issues or void the warranty in any way?
9246 2018-02-22 02:05:32 Putting oil kicking in?!
9247 2018-02-22 02:05:26 The republiCons are lying hypocrites. They organized a group of grifters and snake oil salesmen to prey upon the febble minded & appeal to the rabble rabid predators. This gang is subverting our democracy. We have to rid ourselves of this cancer. RepubliCons took over the GOP.
9248 2018-02-22 02:05:06 I've never seen a holographic program this detailed before. I swear I can almost smell the gun oil.
9249 2018-02-22 02:04:48 Oil dey ur head. Correct bro
9250 2018-02-22 02:04:47 You're the best! Knew you'd have the answer (and another recipe to try)! I actually have the Kirkland choc hazelnut spread which seems to have the same formulation as the European Nutella (sunflower oil vs palm oil).  Would that change the melting point at all?
9251 2018-02-22 02:04:44 Emotional turt m'oil
9252 2018-02-22 02:04:38 I'm obsessed w that toner! It's freaking amazing. If u have sry skin it might be too much tho, cause ur skin to over produce oil and break out.
9253 2018-02-22 02:04:24 i literally have 2 cleansers, 2 huge ass bottles of rose water and witch hazel, sheet masks galore, the tea tree oil is coming out of my nose and the aloe vera smell haunts me at night, i got serums, essences and exfoliation and my skin is still fucking disgusting im sad as fuck
9254 2018-02-22 02:04:15 Buy back was done in Australia. If we can give oil companies billions in tax cuts and subsidies, why can’t we find money to save ourselves.
9255 2018-02-22 02:04:08 She even took the oil #my600lblife
9256 2018-02-22 02:04:04 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
9257 2018-02-22 02:04:02 She needs to say that's blessed oil. #My600lbLife
9258 2018-02-22 02:04:02 I use advantan oil on my eyelids and below my eyes you just have to be careful you don't get it in your eyes. But it's works the best out of anything else I've tried
9259 2018-02-22 02:03:52 Honestly I've done just balsamic and olive oil and it's good

9263 2018-02-22 02:03:16 it's actually an old wives tale that it gets rid of blemishes, i'd say its 50% true because toothpaste will dry out your skin (pimples full of oil)

9265 2018-02-22 02:03:02 Confidence is missing for sure.  The fear you might not be the #1 for long is a strong motivator.
For the record, I think he'll be fine.
9266 2018-02-22 02:02:48 #realtalk try using olive oil instead of butter for all egg cooking needs. Cleanup is like 10,000x better. Might not work for scrambled eggs though. Will try and report findings.
9267 2018-02-22 02:02:09 WV has devastated mountains that shall never be healthy places for animals nor humans to roam. Now the politicians want to give drilling rights for gas and oil, even on private lands to exterminate what land they have left over?  Rape of land to line pockets.

9287 2018-02-22 01:59:40 Why are people using silicone-based polishes? Tung oil is practically free, it’s better for the wood, and this doesn’t happen with it.
9288 2018-02-22 01:59:27 I have really similar eczema and used the advantan oil rather than cream for around my eyes and it legit works but you have to use it at least once a day and within a week I shit you not it so much better!! 
I have eczema on the inside of my elbows and I use dermaid cream.

9299 2018-02-22 01:57:34 Hungarian brass just wanking me off. Too much baby oil, too much Blossom Hill, not enough grip. As you were.
9300 2018-02-22 01:57:29 To be honest, I haven't followed Chinese oil consumption patterns during and after the latest stimulus, to get a sense of their effect on global oil prices. I should.
9301 2018-02-22 01:57:09 Coconut oil- work it in from the ends up, slowly, and comb from the bottom working up. Leave it on overnight, then wash in the am. Apply a couple drops to just the ends to deep condition. I swear by it.
9302 2018-02-22 01:57:01 By the way, you truly don't understand what decentralization is when a crypto currency is being backed by a state  and it's oil and gold reserve's. You are a crypto dumbass or is it "crypto expert" "crypto genius" 
9303 2018-02-22 01:56:56 was right  another oil price drop... inventories don't care. Stronger USD force the oil price to drop.
9304 2018-02-22 01:56:50 The benefits of coconut oil for your skin is fucking amazing

9312 2018-02-22 01:56:20 You can thrive off three scrambled eggs, gently cooked in copious amounts of coconut oil, and one avocado.
9313 2018-02-22 01:56:10 My boyfriends mom just threw my oil in the trash after I put it in the freezer. Her response “I thought it was a BBQ sauce cap.” Huh.
9314 2018-02-22 01:56:05 Raspberry tea and Castor oil is all I use. You have Advil or Motrin? Pop three with a glass of milk, that’ll help too, I just prefer home remedies before taking pills.

9353 2018-02-22 01:50:21 Wanted to plant olive trees when I lived in the diocese of St. Augustine — to produce oil for chrism, etc.  Some varieties can take the climate.

I wonder if any diocese grows at least some of what they use. Nobody in Florida seems to grow their own Palm Sunday palms.

9365 2018-02-22 01:48:26 Yes that’s correct you’ll cause a topical burn to the skin, same with tea tree. Any 100% essential oil unfortunately will do it

9373 2018-02-22 01:47:42 By this math it's ten years or so out until the economy recovers and times start moving up. That makes logical sense actually and times to the last oil boom ever. If OK blows this one like every other one it's bound to continue as west Kentucky... Without horses

9376 2018-02-22 01:47:25 Try putting some agave syrup and maybe a bit of spice or pepper on too, get a sweet/spicy bacon. Best on a drip pan to keep crisp as oil drains

9378 2018-02-22 01:47:00 It's sad when people are deceived into believing that when big oil companies get richer it benefits everybody.
Thank God @bcndp and @BCGreens knows enough to not 'hand over the keys' to @YourAlberta  who is controlled by big oil companies.

9381 2018-02-22 01:46:44 I oil him up so good! My oldest sons just already know to oil down after their nightly showers! 
9382 2018-02-22 01:46:42 I stand with Xavier Becerra because he’s fighting Big Oil, Wall Street, and Donald Trump head-on in court! #CADEM #XB4AG
9383 2018-02-22 01:46:39 Having oil means attracting ppl who wanna exploit it. Yes colonizers a unnuh mi a chat.
9384 2018-02-22 01:46:37 Friday catch me opening, going to yoga, an essential oil party, and then a concert cause I’m a busy bitch who can do it all!
9385 2018-02-22 01:46:36 she says she wanna meet my mama, i said i don’t think you wanna that’s like mixing oil and water
9386 2018-02-22 01:46:23 I have owned my new bedsheets for one hour, and I already got an olive oil stain on them. I’m incorrigible.
9387 2018-02-22 01:45:52 Looks like they are trimming your followers now.
9388 2018-02-22 01:45:17 Rub castor oil on your stomach, put a hot rag or hot water bottle on top and just chill for like 30 minuets.

9390 2018-02-22 01:45:12 I’m willing to get down to one kind of olive oil, if that helps.
9391 2018-02-22 01:45:11 Gotcha now!
9392 2018-02-22 01:45:11 I like oil
9393 2018-02-22 01:45:03 เรียนเกี่ยวกับprocessในโรงงานค่า เพราะฉะนั้นไม่จำเป็นต้องน้ำมัน โรงงานเกือบทุกอย่างต้องมีวิศวกรเคมีเป็นคนออกแบบ/ควบคุมprocessค่ะ หลักๆมี3อันใหญ่ๆคือ ยา,oil&gas,เครื่องอุปโภคบริโภคแบบอาหาร,สบู่ยาสระผม ^^
9394 2018-02-22 01:45:00 Yep...you really just chop pistachios, mix with a little bread crumbs and teeny bit of olive oil, and mix separately mustard and honey...drizzle that on top of salmon and press nut mixture on top of that..easy. peasy and you can't mess it up! No rules..always right!!!
9395 2018-02-22 01:44:58 Multivitamin and fish oil
9396 2018-02-22 01:44:50 must buy the best snake oil in the land.
9397 2018-02-22 01:44:30 Can’t wait to give myself this hot oil treatment tomorrow!!
9398 2018-02-22 01:44:27 Me too! Yay!
9399 2018-02-22 01:44:26 That is appropo....and in my opinion they lost that trade, even though both teams went on to win cups. Ari will lose any trade they can garner for OEL. If the Oil couldn't get him for T Hall, then their price will never get met, and OEL walks...
9400 2018-02-22 01:44:21 It is a tax grab but billions appear to be going to oil industry innovations so I don't know if the oil industry wants this gravy train to end. @jkenney @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley @AndrewScheer @OilGasCanada
9401 2018-02-22 01:44:20 On top of that I got charged $67 for an oil change fml
9402 2018-02-22 01:44:19 Thank ya. I know a couple parents whose kids get cannabis oil. The benefit a lot.
9403 2018-02-22 01:44:18 That and the cooking pray thing! I guess coming up here I'll be having to pay attention to my eating habits and spraying shit down with olive oil is already what i'm about so I want that
9404 2018-02-22 01:44:11 I take bedtime very seriously. face scrubbed, lotion on, oil diffuser on, sound soother on. GOODNIGHT.
9405 2018-02-22 01:43:42 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
9406 2018-02-22 01:43:28 There are few things that feel better than being freshly shaved and covered in coconut oil all over
9407 2018-02-22 01:43:23 That is absolutely untrue. Russiagate is CIA lies to promote war for war profiteers and Big Oil. I will no longer follow your Twitter account. Ridiculous. U.S. oligarchs installed Trump with voter suppression & fraud after the DNC took Sanders out as the leaked emails prove.
9408 2018-02-22 01:43:22 what have you tried thus far? olive oil eco styler gel and a toothbrush usually works for me.

9413 2018-02-22 01:42:56 Sorry, you don't want to stop fugitive methane emissions? Oil and gas aren't going away any time soon. Notley & Co committed to de-carbonize the existing energy system as best they can and I support that.

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
9415 2018-02-22 01:42:51 Proficiat! 1st time AusTX cultural exchange ‘87 threatened to fail cause NL lost interest in TX after oil went down.
9416 2018-02-22 01:42:30 Im so ready to just drowned my self in coconut oil and soak up sum sun
9417 2018-02-22 01:42:17 kylo, lips quivering, eyes moist: please... let me get you an spf moisturizer at least

rey, eating his sugar scrubs straight from the tubs: im just saying if dish soap is good enough to save a porg from an oil spill it's good enough for my face
9418 2018-02-22 01:42:15 I’m so in love with sunny isle black castor oil.
9419 2018-02-22 01:42:13 $ZN How to know if you’re a $ZN bagholder. 1.) you think earnings exist 2.) you think warrants and dilution is good 3.) you think a porta potty falling over into a hole is oil 4.) You don’t know what an Sec filing is but you’ve heard of them 5.) you’re praying for oil daily.
9420 2018-02-22 01:42:12 It worked out perfect too right as oil and gas dropped wow all hammers dropped on it
9421 2018-02-22 01:42:10 I still have my doubts it would do more than slightly slow down his snake oil chicanery.
9422 2018-02-22 01:41:40 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.

9425 2018-02-22 01:41:21 I was so nervous for Jamaica to find oil but i hope our leaders we manage this blessing well and that it will help to grow our economy
9426 2018-02-22 01:40:55 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

9432 2018-02-22 01:40:29 Olive oil AND balsamics. She restocks every time she visits me, and it's her regular Christmas present from me now too.
9433 2018-02-22 01:40:19 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
9434 2018-02-22 01:39:36 more water, less oil 
9435 2018-02-22 01:39:31 It's a little tight but with some Baby Oil, Joey can slide right in. Through the front door....
Wait for it.....
9436 2018-02-22 01:39:21 I’ve discovered when cooking, I can usually use half the amount of oil and (plant based) butter that a recipe calls for. The less junk, the better! 
9437 2018-02-22 01:39:18 Guess what, City lost their first meaningful game in 42. I agree they probably hated losing - don’t/shouldn’t all successful teams? Sorry to break it to you, there will be no meltdown. City will have success this season and will only get stronger - yes with oil money........
9438 2018-02-22 01:39:14 Yo buddy - we ain’t go no time for that as we is soooaaaring. Oil Gold Copper Nickel Cobalt Lithium going to moon - $tsla will get to 2m vehicle by Jan 2019, or have I been smoking some shit tonight from my buddy gerber? $tsla $tslaQ let u decide.

9441 2018-02-22 01:38:59 It’s crazy because in my trunk I have all types of Shea Moisture products.. and blueberry bliss.. and cantu.. and Creme of nature argan oil..  plus a sit under blow dryer lmao.
9442 2018-02-22 01:38:55 Its insane how many people take prescription pills literally 75% of them don't need them. My friends dad got rid of his diabetes and his nerve pain in his back and the doctor asked what he did... CBD oil not garbage pills
9443 2018-02-22 01:38:54 Driving down pipecreek with this oil and gas traffic is hell
9444 2018-02-22 01:38:45 We're playing a game called Snake Oil where one person picks a profession & the others try & sell them something. Tate was a teacher - I tried to sell her a nostril stick, Bill went with regret couch
9445 2018-02-22 01:38:44 My Likeof this tweet is not being added to the avatar bar!
9446 2018-02-22 01:38:15 Why do you ask silly questions? Of course they don't want any of that in real life. They just want to get rich on the backs of the American people.
They represent big business and big Banks and big oil. That's how I see it.
9447 2018-02-22 01:38:01 I looooooove Curls creme brûlée moisturizer tho. With water and Jamaican castor oil my hair literally is so soft and curly .. like how I do twist out curls !! I’m so happy I might have found a  hair regimen
9448 2018-02-22 01:37:41 Thank you...officially off the vegetable oil then 
9449 2018-02-22 01:37:27 Please show then where I can buy a tablespoon of oil, a pinch of thyme, a clove of garlic,a squeeze of tomato puree etc. In order to make said pie you need the ingredients,which would make many pies, & for that you need £12.50 whereas the ready meal pie cost £2.75

9451 2018-02-22 01:37:17 Mkts spooked to the close, and futures are down.  DXY up, 10Y-T tickling 2.95, oil is on low supports.  Still, AMZN most of the recent index rise.  Until tech admits the future earnings growth curve is flattening, we'll just keep rising, and dropping, rising and dropping.

9455 2018-02-22 01:36:50 the deadliest slip and slide has been created with over 50 bottles of dish wash and oil which will be the battleground for today's match
9456 2018-02-22 01:36:34 with fancy oil and everything
9457 2018-02-22 01:36:32 You ate all of them apart from one chip there is oil residue on ur macchips packet nice try hazz haha
9458 2018-02-22 01:36:25 Coconut oil is great for cooking and healthy.
9459 2018-02-22 01:36:06 I will admit disappointment on its reaction to the shooting of Philando Castile, a licensed gun owner.  But Tamir Rice? He's a kid who was shot by cops while brandishing an air pistol with its orange tip removed. News flash: That's what happens when you do that! (see #AndyLopez)
9460 2018-02-22 01:35:59 Although they are like oil and water, I like Thomas with Katherine. Not another young one hoping for a storyline.
9461 2018-02-22 01:35:26 I think clove oil has just saved my life. All hail the clove!
9462 2018-02-22 01:35:10 I stand with Xavier Becerra because he’s fighting Big Oil, Wall Street, and Donald Trump head-on in court! #FightingAndWinning #XB4AG

9464 2018-02-22 01:34:51 Accepting info from someone depends on that someone's credibility and personal motivations. 
Blindly accepting info without evaluating it or where it's coming from makes you a sucker, who buys snake oil.
What you did is normal to avoid being a sucker. Don't apologise for it.
9465 2018-02-22 01:34:42 @GlobalBC 

David Suzuki helped me respect the livelihood of oil workers.
Neil Young compared the sight of the sands to that of Hiroshima.
It takes more energy to produce the oil than the return?
Synthetic petroleum is an option, as are the jobs created elsewhere.
Go Oilers!
9466 2018-02-22 01:34:23 I am sure he made  a lot of money in the religion business. Never had much use for these kind of people. Snake oil salesman.
9467 2018-02-22 01:34:03 What’s pho without oil chili
9468 2018-02-22 01:34:03 A lot of that AB would be from red hit oil sands in the mid 2000s back when oil was roaring toward $150/barrel.  Now?
9469 2018-02-22 01:33:44 i read somewhere it supposedly "mimics" skin sebum so I thought I would try it out. but I might just try the bby oil

Me, an intellectual: Engine syrup
9475 2018-02-22 01:33:24 i need to go check my oil and do my laundry but i’m tired
9476 2018-02-22 01:33:20 Add also sauted garlic in butter or olive oil...
9477 2018-02-22 01:33:19 Have you ever read oil contracts? 
9478 2018-02-22 01:33:19 The hateful evil of the libs is astounding. If the DOJ doesn't step up soon & restore law & civility, then we will have civil war.
9479 2018-02-22 01:33:14 Or logic
9480 2018-02-22 01:33:12 Oil that reached Japan shores seen from sunken Iran tanker: Coast Guard
9481 2018-02-22 01:32:59 Will it be same as British govt continued GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa so as to steal oil. You judge who is right.
9482 2018-02-22 01:32:54 @AndrewHolnessJM they found oil yea....now let's see how much of a leader you are! There are a wealth of information out there Good and bad examples; successes and failures! Selfless or selfish? 
9483 2018-02-22 01:32:40 A run. Hot shower. Lavender oil and baby oil.

Or good dick.
9484 2018-02-22 01:32:33 Don’t get it twisted, sis. I wake up everyday to a headscarf and coconut oil. I’m married to a Black queen, not that it’s any of your business. #ThisIsUs
9485 2018-02-22 01:32:27 $160..for an oil change and air filter on my car! Over charged!
9486 2018-02-22 01:32:26 So when is Zinke going to put in the mines and oil rigs and pipelines here? 
Shame on @Interior @RyanZinke
9487 2018-02-22 01:32:22 탐라 진짜.. ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
9488 2018-02-22 01:32:15 InfoChip's #RFID products are ideal for industries like #oil & gas, rigging, lifting, #mining, #aerospace, construction, & rental companies.
9489 2018-02-22 01:32:10 A lot of the oil boom money went to skating rinks, not too many cities with publicly funded Olympic-sized practice rinks.
9490 2018-02-22 01:31:56 We just got some new *Emu Classic Mentholated Oil 20MG*
9491 2018-02-22 01:31:53 Well Obama and Hillary we're in the back pocket of the middle east, terrorist organizations, and the oil industry. At least Trump is pocketed by home grown Americans who care about America and not foreign billionaires.
9492 2018-02-22 01:31:45 & that box be slippery like trynna walk on oil 
9493 2018-02-22 01:31:31 My coconut oil shouldn’t be melting in February lol
9494 2018-02-22 01:31:16 some rare African cane sugar, organic coconut oil from the villages of Kenya and honey from endangered bees from Sudan
9495 2018-02-22 01:31:16 Ice on my neck. 
CBD oil under my tongue (I like @carebydesign 8:1).

And after it subsides: soak in an epsom salts bath with not-too-hot water.
9496 2018-02-22 01:31:12 I will not let people who don’t understand the concept of a vehicle’s oil change dictate the policies which affect my life.
9497 2018-02-22 01:31:08 President Obama, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
9498 2018-02-22 01:31:08 CBD oil works for some friends that have migraines
9499 2018-02-22 01:31:06 We just got some new *Emu Classic Oil 20MG*
9500 2018-02-22 01:30:59 Chances of the Oil landing OEL is slim to none.
9501 2018-02-22 01:30:56 List of reasons I hate water rinsing my hair:

1. *rinses out the gunk* BAM! Rock hard shrinkage like this mathead never meet a moisturizer.

2. Daily struggle to return to said length without greasiness and using all my product.

3. Realizing I need a trim and hot oil treatment.

9518 2018-02-22 01:29:21 Is it a remake of the old oil/riding video 
9519 2018-02-22 01:29:20 It appears you are struggling to put together a racist talking point. Unfortunately, you have failed due to a lapse in grammar, sentence structure, or general ineptitude. 

Please go huff some gun oil and try again later.
9520 2018-02-22 01:29:20 Allegedly tied to the price of our oil barrel.
9521 2018-02-22 01:29:06 I’m going there selling oil lol
9522 2018-02-22 01:28:58 You are such a dipshit! The last thing we want is further deregulation of oil and gas companies. I hope you don’t have grandchildren Ted because you want to kill the environment that they will be living in!
9523 2018-02-22 01:28:56 Bodohnya statement. Sakit hati pulak baca. Takkan lah dia tak perasan lepas seminggu pakai oil cleanser, iman kat muka terus tambah .

9525 2018-02-22 01:28:49 A man is crossing the street not paying attention and is hit by a truck carrying boxes of Omega 3 pills. His family rushes to the hospital and are so worried but the doctor comes out of the room smiling and says "don't worry, it's only a super fish oil injury" #SorryNotSorry

9527 2018-02-22 01:28:33 There is a deliberate effort to leave out the East in this development.Not even a federal luxurious bus going East.Yu take oil money & run.
9528 2018-02-22 01:28:15 Sure, but I can’t see him signing here and 1/4 (+) of his value would be having home for this year/this years PO.... which is obviously worthless to the oil.
9529 2018-02-22 01:27:52 The C tax is a fraud. It's a greenwashing PST; we're paying for the innovations of big oil. But once in a  tax is  hardly ever removed. I am curious what Mr. Kenney will do once he is in. Money going to the oil industry via the C tax difficult to stop. Inn required @RachelNotley
9530 2018-02-22 01:27:44 Got all of you

9532 2018-02-22 01:27:29 @ford_vibrant I went on 16/10/2017 for my first service 10K km 
Went again on 20/10/2017 as the gear noise still exists, they applied some oil and said the issue was resolved.(this is again temporary)
On Jan 29th I went again saying that AC noise, AC smell and same gear nosie.
9533 2018-02-22 01:27:25 Chop up a couple spicy Thai chili’s and throw them in the hot oil before putting the mushrooms in. Makes a hot oil flavor in the mushrooms. Amazing.

9546 2018-02-22 01:26:13 朝打ち合わせしてたんだけど、相手の方がオリンピックの男子ジャンプに関してあーだこーだ言ってて「はぁ…」と流してたら、一緒にいた姐さんが「あらあら、評論家気取りですか、おほほ」みたいな事言い出して、胃がもげるかと思った
9547 2018-02-22 01:26:12 NO I just got oil on my #WAWA T-shirt. I’m going to cry. I’m obviously going to keep wearing it even though it looks dirty, but still mad about it

9551 2018-02-22 01:25:58 Oh the oral exploration stage. Gotta love it. That has an easy solution though...look up some homemade playdough recepies. They are basically flour, oil and salt so you don't have to worry about him eating it.
9552 2018-02-22 01:25:39 What's this talk about oil?
9553 2018-02-22 01:25:31 It's pretty horrifying that America's political system has been brought to its knees by people who just wanted to sell snake oil pills.
9554 2018-02-22 01:25:25 Is there oil under the schools?????
9555 2018-02-22 01:25:18 WTH? A lot of these accounts of Patriots are restricted. Geez Twitter!?

9565 2018-02-22 01:24:11 So since I am the only one who changes the oil in my car, I swear, someone is sneaking around at night tightening my oil drain plug so that I can't get it off the next time.
9566 2018-02-22 01:24:10 Thank you @FP_Champagne for listening this afternoon to #sk industries on the importance of ratifying #CPTPP agreement. Happy to represent @SaskCanola on how we can grow #canola oil/meal exports to our overseas markets.

9571 2018-02-22 01:23:33 I'm with Germany is worse than me… :( I think you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
9572 2018-02-22 01:23:30 Many Jamaicans did geography in high school and  so knew that Cuba (legit 87 miles away) exports huge reservoirs of oil  . Suh why enuh surprised ???
9573 2018-02-22 01:23:28 People with very few followers and no bios are liberal trolls.
9574 2018-02-22 01:23:26 That brings back a lot of memories . That's what I used to do all summer until I was 25 and then I started racing hydroplanes, 350cc Alcohol and Castor oil burning 12 foot long  clocked at 102 mph in a measured kilometer straight away course, normally raced on circle courses.
9575 2018-02-22 01:23:24 Son i been tryna change my oil on my car for like two hours

9579 2018-02-22 01:22:41 Right BLM keeps telling utter, total lies, congress keeps buying it, the American public supports horses,, but doesn't realize BLM is a rogue org. - and more powerful than most think (cattlemen and oil interests).  I'm not sure what organization has the resources to sue.
9580 2018-02-22 01:22:32 I had one of the worst days and Alex bought me Mexican food to make me feel better and it worked because Mexican food cures everything. It’s the coconut oil of takeout.

9582 2018-02-22 01:22:21 The price of oil and inflation are often seen as being connected in a cause and effect relationship. As oil prices move up or down, inflation follows in the same direction.

9585 2018-02-22 01:22:04 Yessir! How do you feel about coconut oil? That’s really all i use on my skin.
9586 2018-02-22 01:21:55 I also block people who have no pics and/or have few followers. Better to be safe than sorry. I don’t care who follows me or not. Just trying to put my two cents in.

9591 2018-02-22 01:21:16 Red Eye is right Mic. I just noticed you are following 0 on your bio but you and I are following each other. Give it overnight to see if it improves.
9592 2018-02-22 01:21:16 FDGard, an OTC capsule that is peppermint oil and caraway essence yet has no taste. Take before breakfast and dinner, really helped me.
9593 2018-02-22 01:21:15 My painting teacher told me I had no artistic ability because I have never used oil paints before. The same guy also told another student that her artwork was identical to a kindergartner and that she should consider a different non-art related major. I hate professors like that
9594 2018-02-22 01:21:04 Give natural (no butter) popcorn with truffle oil a try sometime. Doesnt mean popcorn is good, but truffle oil damn sure is.

9600 2018-02-22 01:20:16 (i used to get actual baby oil rubbed on me as a young child to get a "better" tan but now i'm all sunscreen and reduced exposure, etc)
9601 2018-02-22 01:20:05 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
9602 2018-02-22 01:19:46 Smoke?! Are you sure you didn't get sold engine oil?! Or some fucked up thing like that?
9603 2018-02-22 01:19:37 For ur information My father is not paying my school fees with Maikanti Baru’s $25Billion oil contract neither is he paying it with Babachir Lawal’s grasscutter money nor is he paying it with illiterate Buhari’s Billions of Pounds hospital bills,until then I think I am good to go
9604 2018-02-22 01:19:13 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
9605 2018-02-22 01:19:13 Plus countries can stop overthrowing governments to gain access to their oil resources.
9606 2018-02-22 01:19:08 Hiya! I’d love to have opportunity to chat with you about coconut oil as lube... as well as any other ingredients I use for our lube. Dm me!
9607 2018-02-22 01:19:07 Why every time it’s a fat nigga in a video you always tagg me you know your ugly long chin venom off of spider man skin and looking ass need to find videos for your ugly ass and tagged your skillet/car oil skin ass in a video next time 
9608 2018-02-22 01:19:06 Really. I cook my own chips in vegetable oil and add salt. Much nicer then any deep fried bought chips cooked in fat.
9609 2018-02-22 01:19:01 I've just begun making my own toothpaste and I love it, so I thought I'd share so that more ppl know it's an option

The recipe I use is very simple: for 1tbs baking soda, add 1tbs coconut oil, 1/8ts salt, 1 drop of tea tree EO & 1 drop of eucalyptus EO

9611 2018-02-22 01:18:55 i wait about 10-15 days for each round of bleach and put One n Only Argan oil hair treatment (or any moisturizing + strengthening hair oil) day and night on the ends to keep it strong.
9612 2018-02-22 01:18:38 Please tell me where you can that an AR-15 for $130.   For that price I'll buy 5 or 6 of them tomorrow.   #idiot
9613 2018-02-22 01:18:35 Changed the oil in a short sleeve shirt at 8 wat
9614 2018-02-22 01:18:18 What if they run out of oil? ;)
9615 2018-02-22 01:17:56 Twitter is all fouled up. I followed you just to see what happens..
9616 2018-02-22 01:17:54 I live for the perfect flavor combination. In this case: Prosciutto, “Ménage” cheese (sheep/goat/cow’s milk), toasted focaccia withis olive oil, chased with Two Brothers Northwind Imperial Stout.
9617 2018-02-22 01:17:52 I hope so, the slight smoke it produced was awful and not even eyedrops helped me.

This happens when you can't fins good quality oil to cook ; _ ;
9618 2018-02-22 01:17:41 Yes agree with you there. Perhaps two rain gauges at each spot. One with oil which is only emptied every few months for accumulated rainfall?
9619 2018-02-22 01:17:40 How about we teach our daughters how to purchase a home, change their own oil, plant herbs and vegetables. Then we can talk about prom dresses and nipple piercings
9620 2018-02-22 01:17:29 Love to see em try!!
9621 2018-02-22 01:16:42 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
9622 2018-02-22 01:16:41 It’s not one of those stores that sells only gourmet olive oil, is it? Olive oil is maybe a worse offender than balsamic vinegar.
9623 2018-02-22 01:16:39 hate oil food.
9624 2018-02-22 01:16:34 The nice thing about cooking is nothing is simple if you don't want to be. Fries are pretty diverse to begin with and there's a lot you can do - oil choice, temp, potato type, cut type, etc.

9626 2018-02-22 01:16:28 People being more worried than excited that we found oil says how much confidence we have in whoever is in charge #Jamaica
9627 2018-02-22 01:15:36 Are you saying "marijuana helps children. On the autism spectrum live a better life?" Wasn't sure about the Pandas part agreed. Lots of children on the autism spectrum have benefitted from cannabis oil.
9628 2018-02-22 01:15:26 Massage that scalp sis get all up in them follicles w/ur fingertips & some Jamaican black castor oil
9629 2018-02-22 01:15:25 RELAX! To ease stress and prepare for bed, soak in a hot bath spiked with a few drops of lavender essential oil. #healthcoach #essentialoils
9630 2018-02-22 01:15:25 Then you throw it in a pan w oil or other things depending on what yr making, it's like ground beef but u gotta put the flavor into it. I usually fry up some garlic n onion n then toss it in
9631 2018-02-22 01:15:22 As a socialist pointed out to me, nuclear also has the potential to end oil dictatorships, especially since you can extract uranium from seawater.

9635 2018-02-22 01:14:59 I hope it’s all under warranty! I brought mine in for an oil change and they kept it for a week cause my brakes were bad.
9636 2018-02-22 01:14:54 I agree with you on so much, Sir, but not on this. He was a con man, a phony snake oil salesman.

9638 2018-02-22 01:14:22 Did you pour the oil on your eyes?!
9639 2018-02-22 01:14:15 They are the number one producers of oil in the world. That's a simple fact you just need to Google.
9640 2018-02-22 01:14:12 Which part dem say the oil was found? Parish? Vicinity? Off the coast of where?

9642 2018-02-22 01:13:55 So Jamaica has oil... there'll soon be  civil unrest and then boom, Jamaica is littered with army bases.
9643 2018-02-22 01:13:26 Oil, salt + pepper.
9644 2018-02-22 01:13:14 yep 80’s until first Iraq war. 
Trillions wasted to protect big oil and big autos when we could have free healthcare and free college tuition and paid apprenticeships.

9647 2018-02-22 01:13:05 i REALLY need to start doing my own oil changes..

9655 2018-02-22 01:11:04 The problem with these articles Mark is that they are all wrong. Firstly they vastly overstated the amount of electricity needed and secondly you never get the accurate costs of the existing systems. Oil drilling, refining, plastic card making, postage, buildings, lorries etc etc
9656 2018-02-22 01:11:04 Wait they reallly struck oil?
9657 2018-02-22 01:11:00 Same here, as a chef, folks can’t just come into a kitchen and start swinging a blade and cooking with hot oil etc without reference and background checks and many times with drug checks as well !
9658 2018-02-22 01:10:59 In what area do you work?

9667 2018-02-22 01:09:42 He was progressive before it was cool. If Sharia courts could afford to waste the oil they would be frying them up like hotcakes!
9668 2018-02-22 01:09:40 I just found out  Chick-fil-A uses peanut oil I'm so sad. Like I'm deathly Alaric to chick-fil-A I'm gonna cry lol

9674 2018-02-22 01:08:29 Using oil based lubes anally with toys is the best, but so far I've been hesitant vaginally. I'll have to do some experimenting!
9675 2018-02-22 01:08:15 My favorite way to cook a steak indoors. Just coat steak w/olive oil season w/ salt &pepper. Be sure skillet is Very Hot. Takes less than 10 min. Delicious!
9676 2018-02-22 01:08:15 Hey @jiffylube — your Poway location was the first place in 60,000 miles to tell me my oil is too hard to change. #isntthatwhatyoudo #wastedtime

9678 2018-02-22 01:08:13 Q1. My fave is a simple pasta, like bacon pasta. Just olive oil, garlic, bacon, and parmesan. I confess I use turkey bacon though! <gasp> #foodtravelchat

9687 2018-02-22 01:06:51 I didn't know about coconut oil treating yeast infections, that's interesting. It makes sense that petrochemical-derived oils wouldn't be good. If only you could crowdfund reliable studies!
9688 2018-02-22 01:06:49 Why exactly are you trying to compare us to Venezuela, Spencer???
Would you like me to loose all respect for you?
 Because, Canada no longer has any socialist crown-corporation oil company. Frankly, I’d be more inclined to support oil sands development, if we did...

9692 2018-02-22 01:05:39 You mix the egg with the mayonnaise, honey and avocado. Then pour the coconut oil in and mix together till there’s no lumps and put in your hair for 30 minutes
9693 2018-02-22 01:05:13 In the oil field.... we drill.... a lot.......

9734 2018-02-22 00:59:29 I've been taking fish oil for old war wounds and to improve concentration. I'm guessing the joints are sucking all the efficacy from them, because I can't really... oh look, a bird!
9735 2018-02-22 00:59:28 Dad made fried arepas so my eyes sting like hell now due the low quality cooking oil

I think that I'll call it a night for now
9736 2018-02-22 00:59:23 Ah. Well the coconut oils purpose is to help the body digest fat soluble vitamins more efficiently. You don't even taste it.  You can also use MCT oil. I don't mess with powders. Honestly there is no biological free lunch.  Eat healthy, move more.
9737 2018-02-22 00:59:15 I am still alive lol. weird stuff twitter is

9740 2018-02-22 00:58:54 I just got my air fryer. I used it and it’s life changing. I recommend anyone who likes to cook easy stuff and frozen foods without using little to no oil, to get one if haven’t yet.
9741 2018-02-22 00:58:45 I have to drop my car off at the mechanics tomorrow cos it's been leaking oil for a couple weeks now.
9742 2018-02-22 00:58:38 We definitely see your concern on this. We also care deeply about our environment & ocean life.Although the chances of a spill happening are VERY unlikely, there is still a risk. In fact, the US is shipping its oil & coal through those waterways as we speak-wheres the protesters?
9743 2018-02-22 00:58:02 Use jojoba oil

9746 2018-02-22 00:57:29 You will find doctors on both sides of the fence because there is only anecdotal info on oil lubes. Manmade oils are generally bad. Plant based are usually okay for most. People aren't doing the studies. There is evidence of coconut oil treating yeast infections.
9747 2018-02-22 00:57:16 short term thinking abounds in AB. I often wonder how many of these younger pro oil types are parents? 2m of sea level rise is real and in their kids' futures...
9748 2018-02-22 00:57:09 Cuz Merica! Your country's got oil? LOOKS LIKE YOU NEED SOME DEMOCRACY!!!!! Oh you want an education? And your only 17? Take out enough money to pay for it that you'll be in so much debt you'll be spending the rest of your life paying for it
9749 2018-02-22 00:56:53 We’ll wait!
9750 2018-02-22 00:56:53 I hope you find something to help! Have you tried using an oil diffuser? Peppermint, Basil or Eucalyptus for allergies.
9751 2018-02-22 00:56:43 After showering, taking a drop of peppermint oil & running it through your hair feels like toothpaste...but for your head. 

It sounds weird, but trust me. It’s AMAZING.
9752 2018-02-22 00:56:43 I did however get my oil changed and wiper fluid filled by the hottest unofficial mechanic in town. Even did a house call while I took a nap!  At least that was good for the day.
9753 2018-02-22 00:56:38 Yeah. It just seems to affect the grain cars. The oil cars seem to be moving by the house just as normal. They also stop often right outside my bedroom window all night. Didn’t know there was a “slow down”

9759 2018-02-22 00:55:50 True, and thus far the record is better here...but laying new pipeline to export cheap dirty oil? Costs to be amortized over decades, low revenues likely to decline as renewables get cheaper, and heavy subsidies to keep the businesses polluting?? Not a good idea, I think.
9760 2018-02-22 00:55:39 Don't you guys read the reviews before you take it in? I watched them change my oil and rotated my tires. Usually it's pretty easy to tell when they are full of shit 
9761 2018-02-22 00:55:35 When you have coconut oil on your hair & you step outside in -22 degree weather, so the oil freezes on your hair!  oops...! But I want nice hair!!! ...The things we do for #beauty. Sigh... #hairmask #haircare

9765 2018-02-22 00:54:59 Canola is half oil so I’m thinking it might have a very low freezing point?
9766 2018-02-22 00:54:57 if i put olive oil on the ends of my hair would it absorb?
9767 2018-02-22 00:54:32 Snake oil meets bullshit peddler

9777 2018-02-22 00:53:15 I prefer the round type gauges just for that reason: less surface area exposed to evap. Oil is a good idea but you would have to replace it every time you empty the gauge. A floating lid would be nice

9779 2018-02-22 00:53:04 I have a choice to use it or not, in my older engines I don’t use it, in my newer ones I do it’s that simple.  O choose to buy from American producers, not corporate companies or oil sheiks, but that’s just me.@JohnMarte1
9780 2018-02-22 00:52:59 Thank you!
9781 2018-02-22 00:52:31 Electric or oil heating? Both?
9782 2018-02-22 00:52:23 That's because they don't want to.  As soon as the US leaves the middle East they loose all that oil that they went in there for in the first place. The government has to stay there to make the illegitimate Iraq war "worth it".

9785 2018-02-22 00:52:07 I thought that the human microbiome wasn't yet well-understood enough to know definitively? Yes recommend their oil based lube just for anal play as I understand it, and they have the most extensive resources I've seen yet on what's ideal for vaginal health

9790 2018-02-22 00:51:53 Wow.   @jjhorgan    Not exactly coming with clean hands.   Tankers with US OIL up and down the coastline while you export coal but you choke fellow Canadians.

9795 2018-02-22 00:50:49 "What? Is there something on my face?" 

There's usually some kind of oil on his face, so it's really not that implausible.
9796 2018-02-22 00:50:33 There's a place in Ontario called Oil City.  They named it that before attempting to drill (since nearby Petrolia and Oil Springs have petroleum) but never found oil.  It's also a small town, not a city.
9797 2018-02-22 00:50:32 Liar. 
At the heart of the sector’s woes is a dearth of pipeline capacity, which has depressed Canadian oil and natural gas prices.

9808 2018-02-22 00:50:01 Staying out until I here “vast amounts of oil”
9809 2018-02-22 00:49:17 Donald Trump and listening go together as well as oil and water, too far separated to even have a pretense of cohesion #ItsAllBullshit
9810 2018-02-22 00:49:13 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
9811 2018-02-22 00:49:08 picking up my car from an oil change with a pile of towels in my arms, normal human things to do
9812 2018-02-22 00:48:42 @outlawdipper @LunkersTV What is a good Gun cleaning kit and what gun solvent and oil that does not smell to repel Wild game do you know of any that works good, if you can get a sponsor out of it great.
9813 2018-02-22 00:48:36 Very carefully. I’d heat up a small skillet with butter or olive oil and quickly re-sear it on both sides. Don’t try to heat all the way thru or you’ll end up with Trump steak.
9814 2018-02-22 00:48:26 And that doesn’t apply to oil?
9815 2018-02-22 00:48:21 Yes, the rebates come from the carbon tax revenue--which was supposed to be used by EFA for energy efficiency programs and household rebates. Reduction of emissions is a cost of production for oil and gas producers; it should be internalized by them, not socialized.
9816 2018-02-22 00:48:16 I am very good at drawing baths. Baths I draw are hot but not scalding, and have just the right amount of oil, bubbles, or Epsom salts as desired.
9817 2018-02-22 00:48:14 hi can someone change my oil for free? lmfao

9821 2018-02-22 00:47:05 my hometown of El Segundo is named so because it provided the worker housing for the second oil refinery that Standard Oil built in that part of California.

9823 2018-02-22 00:46:45 Next check I need to get my hair and nails done and I need more cetaphil and monoi oil.
9824 2018-02-22 00:46:41 Sidenote: Iraqi Kurdistan’s demand to sell oil independent of the Iraqi federal govt is absurd. There are many different systems of federalism in the world, but I can’t think of ANY that allow provinces to sell oil independently of the federal govt.
9825 2018-02-22 00:46:35 Commodities Trading Results (A) - WTI Crude oil:-

9826 2018-02-22 00:46:31 Petro will be a success cause it is backed by oil

 Petro to the moon
9827 2018-02-22 00:46:30 there was also walnut oil and a spoonful of chestnut flour in the mix.
9828 2018-02-22 00:46:27 Meanwhile, have you seen what our "clean" oil & gas sector has achieved in Alberta? Toxic tailing ponds and poisoned landscape that nobody really knows how to restore even if (hah!) the polluters would fulfill that responsibility instead of putting it on taxpayers.
9829 2018-02-22 00:46:25 Anyone still doing oil pulling or is that not compatible with kombucha?
9830 2018-02-22 00:46:22 Four main causes of acne:
1. Excess oil production
2. Clogged hair follicles (by oil and dead skin cells)
3. Bacteria
4. Hormonal stimulation (androgens)

9837 2018-02-22 00:45:30 You do know that MacDonalds isn’t Scottish? The “British” have fucked up England & the English as much as they have Scotland & the Scots! Merchant bankers & Etonian oil thieves have London in common!
9838 2018-02-22 00:45:30 No trouble building a pipeline from Canada to Gulf of Mexico for oil, but bugger doing anything about water for farmers...
9839 2018-02-22 00:45:07 With continued Dollar strength I think USDCAD will visit 1.2920. Stronger Dollar = lower commodities aka Oil
9840 2018-02-22 00:45:02 #canpoli @cathmckenna /2  How does your govt plan to reduce Canada's GHG emissions by at least 200 Mt (the @COP21 "commitment") by 2030, leaving AB's oil sands production growing or untouched?
9841 2018-02-22 00:45:02 Also - virgin coconut oil is great for skin and recovering over-night from a sunburn.  Knowledge acquired from growing uo in Hawaii and surfing my brains loose in Central America))
9842 2018-02-22 00:43:46 For a Texas oil company, that helps worsen global warming.
9843 2018-02-22 00:43:36 I had (small) hope Raanta would end up in Edm to push Talbs. I like the deal for both sides.
9844 2018-02-22 00:43:32 Ohh thanks iman :) sbb sy jenis combination skin tp ada terbaca kalau face oil ni dia bole regulate oil production. Tp xberani cuba 
9845 2018-02-22 00:43:26 You do realize we buy oil from countries that don’t give a fuck about the environment, or women or LQBTQ rights? If we can get our relatively ethical oil to the world there will be a smaller market for unethical oil.

9847 2018-02-22 00:43:16 When I worked in the oil industry most people thought I was a miserable bitch b/c I rarely smiled and acted very Serious. 

At home I’m basically very nerdy and chill. And I like to dance around my kitchen and sing to my cat.

9852 2018-02-22 00:42:49 Putting more guns into a school is like trying to put a oil fire out using napalm.

9856 2018-02-22 00:42:26 @Fox_Claire (3) . . This does no outward medical "harm" - the tribe can all still hear. One fine day, the jungle is cleared (for a palm oil plantation) and the rather numerous tribe all apply for asylum / refugee status in the UK, which is, of course, immediately granted..(contd)

9858 2018-02-22 00:42:10 List of today’s accomplishments: Got an oil change, skipped the majority of my classes cause I can’t breath through my right nostril, bought a shirt online that I didn’t need, and put off studying for a test I ended up not studying for. Wish me luck.
9859 2018-02-22 00:42:09 Giving teachers guns is like if AAA suggested responding to road rage by driving more aggressively, releasing an oil slick from your car, and trying to run the other car off the road.

9863 2018-02-22 00:41:17 Sorry old darling but inconveniently for you they deliberately badged themselves as Scottish, based their HQs in Edinburgh & excluded English folk from their boards until 2007 when the smell started! Odd how you Scots claim British oil is Scottish in marked contrast. 
9864 2018-02-22 00:41:16 SALAMAT SA DIOS SA LAHAT NG BUYERS NG MAGNESIUM OIL...SA MGA NATULUNGAN NITO...
9865 2018-02-22 00:41:15 Did u do DD on any of the financials? Or did you read the filing where the CEO actually wrote “pray that we find oil”? How about the money they’re not making? Also what u just posted does not support your claim at all. And buddy I guarantee u I have way better news sources then u
9866 2018-02-22 00:41:15 Imagine talking like you know cars and then have to call someone to find out how to put oil in your car... same people who forget to change their blinker fluid

9868 2018-02-22 00:40:23 As the news surfaced today that Jamaica has struck oil, a set of tweets that I saw earlier this month came to mind
9869 2018-02-22 00:40:13 You should add some eggs to your zuccini and fry it a like bit with coconut oil. You will be able to eat that way.
9870 2018-02-22 00:40:12 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
9871 2018-02-22 00:40:08 @DrAseemMalhotra have you reviewed your position on olive oil after seeing @bigfatsurprise research?
9872 2018-02-22 00:40:08 朝、無性にタマゴサンドが食べたくなってコンビニに駆け込んだんですが、コーヒーを淹れるのを待っていた若い男性２人が「コッテリ派？アッサリ派？」って会話をしててラーメンの話かな？って思ったら、フィギュアスケートの宮原さんと坂本さんどっちがタイプかって話でした。おはようございます。
9873 2018-02-22 00:40:03 Hi again, Terry, I’m curious... What’s this about 2 pipeline leaks per day in Alberta alone? Where did you get that statistic, if I may ask? 

Also, what about the First Nations who support oil sands development? Why only mention those who are opposed?
9874 2018-02-22 00:39:58 All Televangelist are snake oil salesmen, just like 45.
9875 2018-02-22 00:39:38 That seems more like it, yeah. So it's just a butter spread? Some are even mention with olive oil? I expected maybe a jelly or jam, but whatever works.
9876 2018-02-22 00:39:33 The Venezuelan goverment is technically in default and is dealing with 4-digit inflation due to its own economic policies. It is issuing its Petro token because oil production is down and desperately needs foreign currency to run the country.
9877 2018-02-22 00:39:23 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
9878 2018-02-22 00:39:20 Most places fill to order, or fill only as many as they can sell in a short period of time. But most cannoli are awful, so there’s that. But coconut oil is perfect for frying as long as it’s refined; you’re probably thinking of virgin oil.
9879 2018-02-22 00:39:19 I got complemented on my lashes  this vitamin e oil workin wonders
9880 2018-02-22 00:39:13 Don’t they feel more disturbed that some Hollywood goofball has better security than their children?

9884 2018-02-22 00:38:39 Other areas needed to be addressed and if it can be done using your backup, it is well worth the risk.
9885 2018-02-22 00:38:38 anytime i'm about to sing i eat a spoon full of coconut oil it makes my voice 2946392064538291 times better
9886 2018-02-22 00:38:32 In order for us to reduce GHGs we need to pump more oil and build more oil pipelines.
- Alberta Logic
9887 2018-02-22 00:38:26 Yes Hun, with conditioner & Argan oil/olive oil
9888 2018-02-22 00:38:03 the suggestion that AB has gotten anywhere close to 'full value' for oil and gas in the past 40 years is a joke! oh man. you have been pillaged by #bigoil and don't even know it.

9891 2018-02-22 00:37:27 oh i’ve never heard of jojoba oil  my skin is dry too sometimes, but i always use baby oil and it helps
9892 2018-02-22 00:37:11 I had a teacher who would throw chalkboard erasers at our heads when he got upset. Also had one who had us eat chalk and drink crude oil.
9893 2018-02-22 00:37:06 Nah. Don’t do Vaseline or force it. It’s hurts because it’s the first jump that is a full mm and not a .5mm. Wait 3 months in between stretches and use jojoba oil. You’ll thank me later.

9911 2018-02-22 00:33:49 Fair enough. Hard to get a jump on the originals with over 100 years of support though, and oil has enjoyed it! And why most struggle. David and Goliath. Have a great night, enjoyed the exchange.

9948 2018-02-22 00:30:22 I'm with you that Jones is a repugnant hate filled little man who seems to exist for no other reasons than to get others to hate and in the process fleece his followers with snake oil ("supplements"). I just feel his brand of psychopathy is part of the price of our freedom.
9949 2018-02-22 00:30:19 Canada spends 12 billion on Saudi oil a year, they are a country that beats women or wopeople in Trudeauisim with a stick! Let that sink in, we sell our oil to USA for $30 they sell for $60 think about that liberal voters beat women with a stick!!!

9955 2018-02-22 00:29:55 I agree on a free market! We don’t use ethanol for MPG or BTU though, although most believe that to be true. The real value for refiners is the octane (113). Unleaded would be much higher if oil’s benefits were removed and ethanol’s octane was replaced with hydrocarbon options.

9957 2018-02-22 00:29:42 Ahhahahaha, okay. Yeah, so, I like to make stir fries with canola oil, whole grain noodles, tons of veggies, garlic, and a variety of beans. All vegan. :) I'm excited
9958 2018-02-22 00:29:22 Oily matter that reached two islands in southern Japan is highly likely to come from a sunken Iranian tanker, given its similarity to oil floating near the tanker and a lack of other oil spills in the area, the Japan Coast Guard said on Thursday.
9959 2018-02-22 00:29:20 WHATS THE SECRET TO BEAUTIFUL SKIN??? SCIENTISTS ARE SAYING OLIVE OIL,  amazing results in one week, just dab a little, it should dry in a minute, apply make up, glowing radiant skin.
9960 2018-02-22 00:29:09 Use bio oil! I had a ugly scar from a piercing & it lightened it up & smoothed it out so much!
9961 2018-02-22 00:28:59 Forget all this neverending scapegoating of Assad. Syria’s a pipeline route. And there’s illegal Israeli settlement on the Golan Heights and Genie oil (look it up) steals Syrian oil there. But for msm it’s Assad this and Assad that.
9962 2018-02-22 00:28:57 @vanOnselenP @MathiasCormann And the chips MUST be golden brown, double fried preferably, not just waved over warm oil like most people tolerate... What are your views on sauces other than mayo? Ketchup over tomato?

9965 2018-02-22 00:28:29 Hari tu I pegi Klinik Hana, Dr pun cakap oil cleanser boleh buat pores tersumbat. But in my experience, I pakai oil cleanser laa pores jadi lagi bersih, it looks so diminished. Even using AHA & BHA for 3 months plus pun cannot compare dgn results from using oil cleanser

9968 2018-02-22 00:27:59 Equal amounts of beeswax, shea butter, and coconut oil, melted in a double boiler and poured into molds. I like these twist up containers so they’re more portable, but when I first started I used silicone cupcake trays.
9969 2018-02-22 00:27:33 Daz why it had rabs last night? JA found oil? Lmao they dk how to act?
9970 2018-02-22 00:27:31 They will only run the country further into the ground. Ultimately there will be no one to blame but themselves. An exodus of capable people has already begun and will surely continue, leaving the country to sink to unseen levels of poverty.
9971 2018-02-22 00:27:29 6 hours out from 12:23 freeze; Can you follow now?

9976 2018-02-22 00:26:59 Berman should be thrown in the slammer until the Kinder Morgan expansion is finished and shipping oil. I’d bring her a pack of smokes every week. #cdnpoli
9977 2018-02-22 00:26:57 Sooooo...needed an oil change but couldn’t remember the name of the places that do it. You think searching ‘lube’ on my work phone will cause me trouble?
9978 2018-02-22 00:26:39 What's a good oil for my beard
9979 2018-02-22 00:26:34 Y’all there is some weird grumpy energy out there. Let it test you but don’t let it control you. Wear some cedarwood oil and anchor yourself. Take three deep breaths before you speak. Stretch before you make a move. It’s going to be fine. #metaphysical #advice #HangInThere
9980 2018-02-22 00:26:32 *Goes to the garage and fetches her the finest oil*

Papa: " Ang iyong sasakyan ay nanghihingi na ng change oil."

9982 2018-02-22 00:26:23 It sometimes takes 3-4 hours for an oil change in NJ.
9983 2018-02-22 00:26:22 he's a stain and was spiritually vacant. just another snake oil salesman at the end of the day.
9984 2018-02-22 00:26:02 My wife pops corn in a whirly pop with coconut oil and salts it with Redmond real salt, no butter. It’s a choice snack, movie or no 
9985 2018-02-22 00:25:55 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
9986 2018-02-22 00:25:52 槌が強化されたのは嬉しいんですが、盾と槌、計略目当てで刀、って感じで他の武器種食ってしまってるのが難しいですねぇ…＞バランス

9987 2018-02-22 00:25:49 in a perfect world jamaica's discovering oil transforms us into a more developed country and i can go home after graduating college and not feel guilty about wasting my opportunities
9988 2018-02-22 00:25:49 Billy Graham was a snake oil salesman, harmless & entertaining but just an entertainer enriching himself & feeding his own ego. His best trait was staying out of serious politics, his worst was not practicing birth control the day he conceived his son
9989 2018-02-22 00:25:39 Oh its not snake oil, it is eugenics. 

He’s selling pills that make you sterile.

Php3.35 for diesel

Diesel & gasoline prices in NCR are Php11 to 13 higher than at start of Pres. Duterte’s term
9993 2018-02-22 00:24:34 By the way, 400 million$$ was Iran's oil money. We were holding it since 1979, and we had pay with interest.
9994 2018-02-22 00:24:34 what essential oil do i put in my oil diffuser for having a crazy ass son 
9995 2018-02-22 00:24:32 New carbon fuel infrastructure results in _increased_ harm from carbon emissions. Building new tools to exploit Alberta 'oil' makes the situation worse in the concrete sense of being more difficult to stop. Not building it signals a recognition of what's needed, better for all.

9999 2018-02-22 00:23:45 Bannister's claim that things which are presented as unmitigated should be questioned is not only relevant for Muskrat Falls, but also for Monday's announcement of the @nlliberals' @DwightBallMHA & @SeamusORegan that future oil dvpt in NL will be CERTAIN #MuskratSymposium #nlpoli

10005 2018-02-22 00:21:41 Why are groups running to collect money while Sunni  kingdom have oceans of oil running under their land. How humiliating is this. Buying 100 million palaces in France??? I don’t get it. Ya Allah remove these greedy cowards.

10008 2018-02-22 00:21:28 Oil prices have plummeted. I’m from North Dakota and know tons of people who lost jobs because of low demand. It’s not about oil Mark.
10009 2018-02-22 00:21:23 Obama put sanctions on them. He then also kicked some Russians OUT of the country and took there housing away. They were not happy. 
Why have you done NOTHING? Not signing congress bill, Russia sold NK oil, their interference proven in the ELECTION. (YOU did NOT win). We knew.
10010 2018-02-22 00:21:12 I have noticed that when i soak w a drop of acv, my skin peels even less and retains moisture better. That's great since spring is on deck. I need an amazing sunblock though bc my skin FRIED from drenching it in oil the last few summers.
