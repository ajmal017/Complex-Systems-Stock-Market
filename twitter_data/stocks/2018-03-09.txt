I think the point is that btc (out of all cryptos) is the most sound investment. Most alts are like penny stocks (only much worse), and most people investing in penny stocks don't get wealthy.

45 2018-03-11 23:38:42 Yeah, I know. During the 2008 meltdown, I was watching senior partners of an elite business litigation firm sell their stocks and buying CDs. I was doing the exact opposite because I actually understood markets better than they did.
46 2018-03-11 23:37:03 Funny, but there are laws against that. I guess that means you really don’t have a problem outlawing bump stocks and military style weapons.

62 2018-03-11 23:20:14 #stocks A sure way to great riches is to buy quality stocks with a proven track record no matter your age or income level. Quality, quality, quality. With all dividends reinvested in a 401,with yearly investments in them, especially when they're out of favor, and never sell them.

68 2018-03-11 23:17:06 The wins are, in part, the Tax cuts, the booming economy and stocks, the historically low unemployment for all groups as defined, and the reduction in illegal crossings. Plus the consumer confidence levels and patriotism. Many great wins and more to come.

70 2018-03-11 23:15:34 I honestly could care less about bump stocks themselves. Problem is the bill is not about bump stocks only. Just has that nice little name. It's about anything that increases the rate of fire. The loopholes are great/sarcasm.Thiscould include a lot of devices I won't mention here
71 2018-03-11 23:14:36 I like that you think buying stocks is a badge of honor, when they’ve been going one direction only since the 70’s. Thats a much easier market than crypto. Forex on the other hand, is the big boy table

101 2018-03-11 22:40:59 What they're trying to do is the same as putting a "bandaid" on a broken leg; get rid of the assault weapons, let there be a ban on gun stocks, make buyers have a waiting period in order to check for possible mental illness, and other important issues.

106 2018-03-11 22:38:59 Well-regulated. Universal background checks, no-fly list restrictions, insurance for assault-style weapons, no bump stocks. You can own a gun—but it comes with civic responsibility. You don’t have someone shoot a first-grader with 10 rounds and have government do nothing.

113 2018-03-11 22:30:37 That’s just it. The GOPs only way to win right now is not to force twitter and FB to kill fake bots as a threat to national security because you know capitalism. Twitter/FB have to get that return on stocks.
114 2018-03-11 22:30:36 Trump's father purchased his 'through the door'. His professors describe him as 'unremarkable'. He studied Real Estate yet made less at it than if he'd just stashed his inheritance in stocks & bonds. His casinos were a flop. He's $$$billions in debt. Face it. He's an #Idiot.

121 2018-03-11 22:26:14 .@whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. Instead, insist on clean reciprocity!
122 2018-03-11 22:24:31 Wall Street is not ignoring. This is why stocks are at all time highs. Central banks removed the risk premium from markets and added all this money

$UPS - In Apr20 110C @ 3.67.  Plan to be in to ~$117.80; then out for rebuy/until breaks $121.25.  See @Marlon_Dee and @Tr3ndyCharts for similar thoughts.
126 2018-03-11 22:20:21 Volatility equals profits when you are day/swing trading. These stocks can swing 20,30,50 or even 100% in hours or days and we take those profits and get out. Personally the longest I am in a stock is three days. Blue chips are lucky to make 3% on the year
127 2018-03-11 22:20:11 You’re so brave. We did the same with our broker and gun stocks so don’t be thinking you’re all that.  Now I’ve got to go out and buy Disney.

131 2018-03-11 22:16:02 What’s funny?
132 2018-03-11 22:14:53 I will offer you a wager my friend. I have a crisp $10 note with the lovely Kate Sheppard on it that says Phil Twyford and therefore Labour will have added more houses to required stocks at the end of term one than Nats did in 9 years.
133 2018-03-11 22:13:59 This is laughable.  The market is totally fickle going up one day and down the next.  All they are doing is gambling.  The day traders took the wind out of value investors who held onto stocks.
134 2018-03-11 22:13:37 Bump Stocks. Anyone else think this was Wall Street related? 
135 2018-03-11 22:13:23 Bump stocks?  Come on Congress.  Literally the least you can do.
136 2018-03-11 22:13:00 Icahn dumping steel stocks right before your tariff announcement....It does not matter if you are the President,  insider trading is illegal.

138 2018-03-11 22:10:32 I was telling people the other day that homey is TEFLON DON. the dude slaps punitive tariffs on the world and stocks SOAR over who will get exempted...WTF? there is ZERO consequence for his actions.
139 2018-03-11 22:08:21 So we do away with all financial punishments for crimes, then? You realise how many crimes carry financial tariffs? What do you want instead? Put people in the stocks & have the crowd throw rotten fruit?
140 2018-03-11 22:08:09 It IS the GOP that hands guns out like candy and won't ban bump stocks and assault rifles. Trump's America! Indiana is a GOP state. Shocking!

142 2018-03-11 22:07:24 That NRA statement  just shows the fact that the NRA is only about selling guns. They say “consider investigating” bump stocks but when it came time for legislation they pull back. In the aftermath of the worst mass shooting they call to destroy states rights to allow more guns
143 2018-03-11 22:06:37 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks is a slippery slope of banning any other firearm accessory. Bad idea. But since you can do the same thing as a bump stock with just your finger. Are you going to ban fingers? #firearms #guns #ConcealedCarry #CCW #alwayscarry #gunowners
144 2018-03-11 22:06:26 How're stocks now? I'm sure tgat info used to be on your website but I can't find it now...

148 2018-03-11 22:05:37 My question is how in the hell anyone would invest money with someone that’s this  if he had his way the economy would tank I bet he advised his clients to sell off there stocks when Trump won!

151 2018-03-11 22:03:59 Really? You are going to promote stories like these when GOP won't do anything about bump stocks and assault rifles and most of the terrorist shooters in this country are white? This story reads like propaganda for a Red State.

Provide a logical reason why anyone needs an AR-15. No responsible gun owner I know has one, and they hunt and defend their homes just as well

164 2018-03-11 21:50:45 Hey Matti o, just to be clear, the way you trade stocks is based on statistics and algos /other/or ?
165 2018-03-11 21:50:06 Answer: Because he passed the background checks, and under Obama, the ATF determined that bump stocks were an accessory, and was acceptable for sale. Gun manufacturers, and the NRA had nothing to do with it.
166 2018-03-11 21:49:38 For anyone who is upset about the bump stocks. You don’t need one. A piece of wood, 3 screws and a doll rod will do the exact same thing

168 2018-03-11 21:47:26 how about reading the bill about banning bump stocks n AR guns
169 2018-03-11 21:46:12 all fun and games until someone gets their feelings hurt 
170 2018-03-11 21:45:16 .@whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. Instead, insist on clean reciprocity!
171 2018-03-11 21:42:55 It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons- among them, pension funds- to measure their investment 'risk' by their portfolio's ratio of bonds to stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio INCREASE its risk. 
Warren Buffett, 24 Feb 2018, #USS
172 2018-03-11 21:37:27 Let's see if there teeth in the plan re gun control.  But I think it will only deal with what Trump thinks are good preventive measures & the crazy idea of arming teachers. Making bump stocks illegal will need Congress even though the President may try to do it by himself.
173 2018-03-11 21:35:38 Nantucket should go old school and put the   perpetrators in the stocks when they catch them. A day or two of public shaming and being pelted by rotten fruit should teach them the error of their ways.
174 2018-03-11 21:35:30 @realDonaldTrump has done good but it looks like he don't want to arrest elites! Sessions couldnt bust Clapper??? Then trump ORDERS Sessions to ban bump stocks???
175 2018-03-11 21:34:53 Yes i could agree but spreadsheet is solely based on revenue and current marketcap lol i can argue namaste marketcap should be higher as well currently since they only sell vaporizers atm. lol one or two weeks left for the cannabis sales license for more revenue streams
176 2018-03-11 21:34:36 @realDonaldTrump you are a traitor to the the 2nd amendment. Not a man of your word. You’ll lose in 2020 because of bump stock ban even though we want to own bump stocks. Dangerous precedent YOU set. BAD PRESIDENT JUST LIKE THE REST!!!!
177 2018-03-11 21:34:32 Have you spent any time looking into any other sales or purchases of any other stocks owned by any of the billionaire confidantes of Trump? Even if there were fire here, do you think Shah would have known, or bothered to prepare a different answer when the evidence is so weak?
178 2018-03-11 21:33:34 This rule  applies to many names advertising on Twitter offering subscription services for monthly and annual fees (WHO ARE NOT REGISTERED to advise re stocks, options, indicies, bonds, foreign exchange, commodities)(Similar rules in US with NFA and state regulators)
179 2018-03-11 21:33:15 Liar, liar pants on #FIRE! Bump stocks aren't dangerous devices, but - some of the people using them can be. Passing a #Law doesn't guarantee anything! Similar result can be achieved by hooking your thumb through a belt loop - are you going to ban belt loops next?
180 2018-03-11 21:32:57 Presidents cannot control the price of gas, the rise and fall of stocks or the Econ in 12 months...it takes years for policy re economy to produce results.  The Econ was trending up w Obama.
181 2018-03-11 21:32:44 I do like Disney though. I tend to ignore those overly bullish or bearish on stocks I own.
182 2018-03-11 21:32:00 Think I'll stay in bed and let Bonkers pick the stocks. As long as he has brekkie & basket he gives not a fig about RET or any such stuff.
183 2018-03-11 21:31:51 Banning Bump-Stocks is akin to pouring a kettle of hot water onto an iceberg to make it melt.
An action that'll make no difference... Like The Bullet-Buttons on California Market Assault Rifles.
184 2018-03-11 21:31:00 Yo @Snapchat y’all did the dumbest shit ever with the update & killed you all stocks lol who ever agreed to doing that need to be a fired dumb ass
185 2018-03-11 21:30:36 It’s a housing wealth tax, strategically targeting that. The difference being people with $3 million in stocks or their business aren’t contributing to housing problems, while paper wealth in real estate is.

189 2018-03-11 21:28:46 .@GOP 

Bump Fire Stocks. Need to be banned. But they are not the priority focus! Military Assault Style Rifles are. Anything using a large capacity clip and shooting faster than a finger pulled trigger. 2400 or so. All need to go.

Watch the video on Slide Fire Website...stupid!

I think going forward AIM traders will have to extend their horizons beyond 24-48 hours as we are not in that climate anymore 

We will see money migrating towards stocks with only the best BOD’s and a firm business plan
193 2018-03-11 21:25:20 In case you don't know it Trump a band on bump fire stocks is a Trojan Horse it's a slippery slope to getting all semi-autos band you are turncoat you will not be getting my vote. To get reelected I guess you're still that Big far-left liberal from New York
194 2018-03-11 21:25:09 Are bump stocks really worth fighting for?
195 2018-03-11 21:24:15 No auto or semi auto weapons in civilian hands/ sold anymore. To own one is a felony. Turn them in.
Restrictions on type & amount of ammo & clips.
No bump stocks.
Serious background checks.
Mandatory waiting periods.
Mandatory gun safety courses, tests and licences.

198 2018-03-11 21:21:23 HHHAHA
199 2018-03-11 21:20:43 just today I've read a news story about the experiment where ppl made a monkey pick the random stocks 10 years ago and it turned out that the monkey earned more than some high profile investment funds
200 2018-03-11 21:20:40 I can't believe the NRA are suing the State. over a tiny change in the law. They are evil. and anti-American. You should expose the people.behind them who really profit... the gun manafacturers, their execs and those who. have stocks. in them.. #followthemoney
201 2018-03-11 21:16:49 I fully believe that the radical lib lawmakers know exactly what they r doing at all times who the he'll ever heard of bump stocks before the Vegas shooting I didn't and I've owned firearms for over 30 so they r well researched while playing dumb2 push their confiscation agenda
202 2018-03-11 21:16:28 Actually I was saying on paper. Sure performance wise ISB takes the throne but if you had said before the start of PSL, the stocks of Karachi are richer.
203 2018-03-11 21:15:30 US tech market cap + AMZN

"Just five stocks account for half of the 7.4% rally from the February 8 low to today's all-time high in the Nasdaq 100. The five = Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Intel"
204 2018-03-11 21:13:54 citizens can't get machine guns, so they are using AR-15s and modifying them with bump stocks. 

those didn't exist 200 yrs ago like u are trying to imply about "guns" being around that long.
205 2018-03-11 21:13:16 @NRA doesnt give a hoot about murders of school kids,or murders of innocent victims of gun shooting. Its ALL SALES AND STOCKS. Buying politicians and air time with money from members to instill unsubstantiated fears. Same argument of "2nd A"under attack. Only ignorant ppl believe
206 2018-03-11 21:12:33 He's doing everything I hired him for. Low unemployment, record high stocks, ISIS back in their caves, wall in progress and tax cuts all in one year. 7 more years Trump as POTUS is a no brainer. He will win bigger in 2020 than 2016.
207 2018-03-11 21:12:03 Key is to be a skeptic. Every public biotech has a good *story* but you have to look under the covers. And you can't fuss about price movements - if you still like the stock, just wait them out or buy more. Focus on stocks with quality long-term investors (people like Baker Bros)
208 2018-03-11 21:10:49 Newly listed / 1960/70 selection / French new old stocks
209 2018-03-11 21:10:45 LONG $DIS!!! Hopefully the stock market will award it with a generous rise and hold of a long overdue price increase as opposed to stocks like $NFLX.

216 2018-03-11 20:56:54 Ruth Davidson will lose her seat if the Tories don’t back the fishermen, as 70% of all fish stocks are in the North Sea. Scottish fishermen have really suffered under the EU.
217 2018-03-11 20:56:53 Where is Trump’s Executive Order to ban bump stocks?
218 2018-03-11 20:56:06 ‘Common sense background checks’ sounds like spin. We need UNIVERSAL background checks, permanent bans of assault weapons, bump stocks, large capacity magazines, & cop killer bullets. The right to own a gun does NOT trump my right to live.
219 2018-03-11 20:55:35 <h1>Trending Stocks will be posted</h1>
220 2018-03-11 20:49:13 It absolutely does. And you can save bones to make stocks for soups and stews. And depending on the bone, and your bravery, you can eat the marrow, too
221 2018-03-11 20:46:03 how so? You have a problem with better background checks? Or with getting rid of bump stocks?
222 2018-03-11 20:44:16 Leader? Trump's a showman, a film-flam man, a con man and a reality TV host & I almost forgot Wrestling -Trump claimed he bought “Monday Night RAW” from the WWE empire built by the McMahons. It turned out to be an elaborate hoax, but the company's stocks went through the roof...!
223 2018-03-11 20:44:01 Wonder if rice stocks went up when the first iPhone came out.
224 2018-03-11 20:42:05 @POTUS @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @VP banning bump stocks are not enough. Pass a bill where everyone purchasing a gun must show valid ID & posses a current background check issued by local law enforcement where gun is purchased & all guns must be registered
225 2018-03-11 20:41:19 Lmao, Army dudes on this train are talking about dividend stocks and one is like “what do you think of cryptocurrencies?” I say to him “better investment right now than dividend stocks!” and they all give me the stink face before continuing their convo. 
226 2018-03-11 20:40:25 Crypto is like "stocks on steroids", so after a major dip, the market may recover faster. Plus, the good thing about some, like #XRP, it's more than stocks. The more #XRP is used (and it will be, because that offers companies the highest savings) => more demand => higher price.

233 2018-03-11 20:34:05 Yes it is a good idea. Only high yielding SA stocks make sense to me in a TFSA, but each person has their own quirks & I hate buying SA based ETFs.

237 2018-03-11 20:27:35 The stock market is being kept artificially high with corporations buying back their own stocks with the money they got under the #TrumpTaxScam.  Will the stock market see another 1929 because of it?
238 2018-03-11 20:22:07 We have an algorithm that reads the text of tweets for individual stocks and scores them for bullishness or bearishness. Then we aggregate them for the bullish and bearish lists. The breadth indicator is the monthly bullish count minus the monthly bearish count.
239 2018-03-11 20:21:53 Not true. On Friday’s show only one block was devoted to bitcoin. The rest was stocks and options. It’s just that the bitcoin stuff is so memorable. We should probably do more.

248 2018-03-11 20:11:37 This is an economy that continues to pick up steam due to @BarackObama policies. But it is not yet healthy for most hardworking Americans who don't have stocks, & need job training, healthcare, & fair wages.
249 2018-03-11 20:11:08 The NRA is a piece of shit. We don’t need bump stocks. That’s not a constitutional right. #MSDStrong
250 2018-03-11 20:10:52 Congrats on win guys  @nucci39 @CharlieMosey @elcreido18 @Stocks_68 @PeteyL88 @C_Schaber @RBirzi @Josh_Scoon @dirtydc13 @jjorgensen15 @Marrsy33 @Chadmister10 @RussMoyer
251 2018-03-11 20:10:07 Imagine all police officers walking around with assault weapons boosted with bump stocks? Would feel like living the army was controlling the country right? THAT’S WHY IT’S STUPID TO SELL THIS TO ANYONE regardless of age!
252 2018-03-11 20:10:02 I’m sure Bobby is really happy in little bro Danny losing today.  It would make a fun 4th of July bbq at the Hurley’s this yr. if true.
253 2018-03-11 20:09:40 Yeah its good and free to play, can get a little frustrating but no more than Aim stocks 
254 2018-03-11 20:09:35 That one should stick to stocks that just go up and up.
255 2018-03-11 20:09:09 Am very new to penny stocks I do own $VGID and I wonder what good investor hangout YouTube videos that like this one is a year old is it past may  perform that way again sorry so long trying to learn.
256 2018-03-11 20:08:20 Already republicans tried to trade less bump stocks for more guns + when democrats said no blamed them 

Horrifying willingness to risk lives of hundreds more in another Los Vegas type massacre by making bump stocks something to be traded instead of banning needs outed to public.
257 2018-03-11 20:05:52 @MagicPoopCannon in one day you will have a bull back up. and calling for your inverse H&S which i hope will happen. warren buffet said you only loose money trading in stocks. and i bet 90 percent of people who follow trading advice in bear markets actually lost money.
258 2018-03-11 20:04:58 Very well said Ed. It really is a fine line between #investing, #trading, and just flat out gambling. @EconGlobal #stocks #forex #bonds #yield #marketnews
259 2018-03-11 20:04:39 @realDonaldTrump which stocks do you like?
260 2018-03-11 20:01:41 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse an executive order to ban bump stocks sounds good in the short term but opens the door for future administrations to order bans on anything they want.  Don't betray your oath to uphold the constitution.
261 2018-03-11 20:01:00 Sad thing is that the  late  Min of Public works Stella Sigcawu was advised by White owned firms on how CIDB should be structured the like Steffane Stocks and Group 5 ensuring black contractors must really struggle to get higher grade hence its happening
262 2018-03-11 20:00:39 I really don't understand why people think it's okay or even necessary to ban bump stocks, that isn't a slippery slope and dangerous.

264 2018-03-11 20:00:37 The question for republicans is, "Are you willing to chance another los Vegas with 50 dead and over 400 wounded with rifles using bump stocks just to placate the do - nothing - about - guns - no -matter - what - it -is crowd?"
265 2018-03-11 19:59:36 Trump is about to become a one term president... Pushing gun control will only hurt him. How many democrats are going to vote for him because he bans bump stocks? I thought so... But how many republicans will not vote for him? Hmm, @realDonaldTrump might one to think about that
266 2018-03-11 19:59:33 Ban assault rifles bump stocks and high capacity magazines now
267 2018-03-11 19:59:04 Congratulations @Stocks_68
268 2018-03-11 19:58:40 In the old days Ted Turner owned the team of course, even though Braves were never a big spending team like the Yankees or LA. But it's more fun having a billionaire eccentric owner that might shake things up rather than only looking at profits and stocks.

273 2018-03-11 19:55:08 @chucktodd @msnbc @cnn @chrishayes et al  Cover the bill to ban bump stocks. 5 mos after LasVegas massacre still not passed.
274 2018-03-11 19:53:36 There's a supermarket near me that stocks them. Too tempting though
275 2018-03-11 19:52:32 I love how Trump takes away your gun rights in a way Obama could only dream of, think, if Trump bans bump stocks government can ban other parts as well, barrels trigger assemblies, handguards, etc
276 2018-03-11 19:52:05 Nope. Give the rest of us large bumper stocks. 
277 2018-03-11 19:50:28 Officially going back to @StocksToTrade absolutely can not stand finding stocks with out. All the info u could ever need all in one place. So much easier then ten different web sites

280 2018-03-11 19:47:25 High-beta stocks were leaders during the past trading week. Risk inclination among investors is also a bullish signal. Furthermore, the overall picture gets confirmed by short-term momentum. It is on the rise and yet another bullish hint.
281 2018-03-11 19:45:44 Those who did that need putting in stocks for the monkeys  P!!S on
282 2018-03-11 19:44:16 Ban assault rifles bump stocks and high capacity magazines now
283 2018-03-11 19:44:05 Ugh, that last paragraph. Yes, the National Rifle Association wants the next generation to enjoy shooting sports; how pernicious of them. This is not like bullying Congress to keep bump stocks legal; it's what they mainly used to do before they went nuts in the '70s and '80s.
284 2018-03-11 19:43:06 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
285 2018-03-11 19:42:54 Nic do you know anyone out there which has a deal with Tradingview to get a discount on the year charge? Been using the free version for long time but really want LSE stocks in realtime and not 15min delay.

@NicTrades
286 2018-03-11 19:41:51 So sorry too hurt your feelings. Stocks go up and down for no real reason all the time.
287 2018-03-11 19:41:24 @BranstonUK why is it that only @Tesco stocks your relish??!
288 2018-03-11 19:40:44 It's statements like this that make Conservatives hate Liberals and think we want to take all guns away. However, most want sensible gun control laws, like keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, banning bump stocks, and banning high capacity magazines.
289 2018-03-11 19:39:37 GA,, despite the magnitude of Friday's retracement  
on the sp500, the overall bearish sentiment has not changed. First, noticeable divergence between Djia and Nasdaq is never good. Second, only handful of stocks on nasdaq are responsible for 50% of the move from feb 9th low.
290 2018-03-11 19:39:10 As the NRA - defends banning bump stocks- yeah..no thanks! You are not supporting 2A...remember folks- Shall NOT be INFRINGED-
291 2018-03-11 19:39:01 Where is the majority of Fish currently landed in the UK sold. If no access to EU vessels allowed is there capacity for uk vessels to fish those stocks. Does the UK have enough resources to process all the fish that would no longer be caught by Eu vessels and processed in Europe?
292 2018-03-11 19:37:53 Florida increased age limit, banned bump stocks, increased bg checks. That's all the gun control they get for this year
293 2018-03-11 19:36:58 (Do any of my Michigan friends trade stocks?) What are your hot picks for Monday morning? I'm looking at ATOS and SNMX
294 2018-03-11 19:35:08 This is why we need to ban bump stocks and have common sense gun reform
295 2018-03-11 19:34:29 LETS GO! I’m not scared of losing stocks! “Losing stocks” is my middle name!
296 2018-03-11 19:34:18 Stoats and weasels, which they consider a threat to grouse stocks. The small mammals do naturally predate on grouse eggs. This wouldn't naturally be a problem but for the shooting industry grouse eggs = shooting profits, so any predators are ruthlessly eliminated.
297 2018-03-11 19:33:15 Bump stocks are no big deal.
298 2018-03-11 19:30:41 "I've spoken to a bunch of young Crypto speculators in the past few weeks who basically view it as a game.
Games with money is called gambling.
That's fine, and not that different from how some "play" stocks/fx/commods.
Just don't confuse it with investing."

302 2018-03-11 19:26:39 No guns before 21, a full and effective ban on bump stocks and semi-automatics.  You forget that the Constitution calls for "a WELL REGULATED militia".
303 2018-03-11 19:25:50 Joes watching CNN or something.  Fuck bump stocks anyways. No accuracy

311 2018-03-11 19:20:12 All well and good, but blue hair dye probably isn't something the Empire requisition officer stocks.
312 2018-03-11 19:18:54 That’s what I’m saying there is gun control look up the new changes being made. Even trump is pushing for the age to go to 21. I highly disagree with this but he is. Bump stocks are being banned. Threats are being taken more seriously. I’m just saying there’s been so many changes
313 2018-03-11 19:18:33 @realDonaldTrump, I'm an NRA member, been one a long time. Ban the damn bump-stocks, raise the age for AR/AK to 29. I'll still vote for you!!!! #MAGA

315 2018-03-11 19:18:01 Do we really NEED the WH to say anything? The facts are the facts. He dumped 30 mil in stocks a few days before the announcementsbof tariffs. Please! It's a stinkin roadmap of slimy deals and corruption. Trump's fingerprints are all over this!
316 2018-03-11 19:17:58 look at what they are actually proposing...no law abiding citizen should have issues with shit like no bump stocks...finger print tech so only registered owner can shoot it, etc. :P
317 2018-03-11 19:16:56 Yep. An IPO in stocks is I.P.O so my logic is ICO is the same
318 2018-03-11 19:16:44 Wow, that's quite bad. MG's are great but not worth THAT much. Shame that there's no proper place to get Gunpla in the UK. It's expected where i live but in the UK you'd think there'd be a shop that stocks them for a fair price.
319 2018-03-11 19:15:23 Haha, that it will indeed. At this point I wouldn't be surprised if Trump owned stocks in her brand.
320 2018-03-11 19:15:23 Seems to have a penchant for 18 yr, big boobed, adult performers.

321 2018-03-11 19:15:16 A rich person with mostly passive investments (stocks & bonds) can set up a genuinely blind trust. An active investor with complex personal business relationships can't really do the same. The next best thing is to cede management to a trusted partner.

333 2018-03-11 19:09:35 Some people commenting here really need to pay closer attention to #2A advocacy that doesn't come from the NRA or the Trump administration... It's not about bump stocks, and it doesn't end at bump stocks.
334 2018-03-11 19:07:50 about the company or the stocks you ARE holding.  You do however, all of you,, rely on the old adage that,,, "A Fool and his money are soon parted".  i.e. the investors that does no DD, and listens to you guys!
335 2018-03-11 19:06:51 Mr. Trump when it comes to guns and raising the age you R wrong you  R a family man would you want someone's daughter to be able to defend themselves at the age of 18 while going to college or anywhere else from being raped by 200 pound man or not? Stopping bump stocks won't help

338 2018-03-11 19:04:56 Trying not to answer because the answer is ridiculous and embarrassing, I see. Ok. Now explain to me why flash suppressors, bayonet lugs, pistol grips, folding stocks or barrel length make a rifle more “assaulty” than the same gun without them.

344 2018-03-11 19:03:29 Why would law abiding gun owners be against sensible gun reform? If the owners are law abiding, there will no problems obtaining firearms. Extensive background checks,raising age to 21 for firearm ownership,no bump stocks,restricting high capacity magazines, shouldn't be an issue
345 2018-03-11 19:03:26 But Seeking Alpha articles note the P/E ratio is dirt cheap on those stocks! Cyclical? What’s that!

352 2018-03-11 18:55:11 Agreed. But note the 3-way incandescents also: 3-ways and other "specialty" bulbs are exempt from the ban. I suspect there's no way a convenience store stocks 3-way bulbs otherwise.

356 2018-03-11 18:54:15 Ahh... good old feel good legislation! Bump stocks weren’t used last report I read. The age is going to be deemed unconstitutional in the long legal fight ahead. The national movement is about placing a bandaid over a gaping wound. When will y’all try and fix the real issue?

366 2018-03-11 18:44:56 This is kinda petty. They said to regulate bump stocks. That’s it. The 18-20 year old thing and the inclusion of other devices (it that happens) is not their doing. They are actually suing. What is GOA doing?

382 2018-03-11 18:33:57 That still beats investing in Canadian small cap resource stocks, where the chart on the right is the same, but the chart on the left is going down instead of up… (ie. SD, PWE/OBE, etc)
383 2018-03-11 18:33:27 Actually, I don’t care if I pay more taxes if it’s going somewhere useful.. I do mind tax cut to corporations.. getting these cuts only to buy up more stocks, end up firing people.. Where are these alleged jobs as promised? I pay more to make the rich richer? That’s absurd..
384 2018-03-11 18:33:14 Absolutely. This is why worthless low float stocks will often rip on air. Clueless buyers chasing each other for more expensive entries w/ limited inventory of sellers. They’re relying on the Greater Fool Theory to get them out at a higher price, before insiders/promoters sell.

388 2018-03-11 18:30:20 He looks like he stocks up on tiki torches
389 2018-03-11 18:29:27 Is that why their stocks keep falling ?
390 2018-03-11 18:29:09 The last I checked, Trump beat Hillary in 2016 with half the campaign spending and 1/6 the staffing. Sounds pretty smart to me. He is also banning bump stocks while you got elected to the Senate with the NRA’s backing.

392 2018-03-11 18:28:00 remember when a bajillion cruise missiles failed to significantly crater a single airfield and all the defense stocks shot up like 100%
393 2018-03-11 18:26:50 A standard semi-auto rifle, just like any other of thousands, but the killer added a bump stock to simulate auto capabilities. Ban bump stocks, for sure. They're stupid in my opinion.
394 2018-03-11 18:26:12 They would be ramping the stocks when they had already sold then moving onto their next one. Whatever price target they gave, half it and that's their selling price. #ggp target was 5p but rampers sold at 2-2.5p.

396 2018-03-11 18:25:17 @NRA even though I’m a gun owner and a card holding concealed carry permit holder, I don’t see the need for your support of Bump Stocks. None whatsoever. With the Delta issue I considered joining your ranks but this issue and your support has caused me to reconsider.

400 2018-03-11 18:23:02 Capacity meant more than rate of fire (don't misinterpret that as my advocating for bump stocks, I don't).  Shooter had drum mags holding 100 rounds each.  Even using the 30-round mags seemingly everyone wants to ban he'd have spent more time reloading than shooting.
401 2018-03-11 18:22:50 North Korea talks, Isis decimated, wages up, stocks rallying, gun legislation talks, mental health reform, AIR Traffic overhaul, infrastructure, DACA, tax cuts, regulations slashed, trade renegotiated, constitutional judgeships. Whats your beef really?

404 2018-03-11 18:18:59 I had a nightmare last night.  I woke up and it was Monday Morning 11am, and I overslept the open of the market, and my stocks had plummeted with no stop loss in place  looking forward to tomorrow $bpmx $andi $clka
405 2018-03-11 18:18:02 Do you support gun reform? Do you believe that bump stocks should be banned? Do you think all assault style weapons should be banned?
406 2018-03-11 18:17:55 Well sure but bump stocks are very unpopular among enthusiasts, psychos, and hunters. Like nobody uses them. Except that one guy.
407 2018-03-11 18:17:02 NRA is giving up bump stocks to save assault rifles. 

Bump stocks are a throwaway chip.
408 2018-03-11 18:16:27 Classic sign of market top? Less & less stocks participating. Funds selling most stocks and crowding into the largest cap liquid names, whether to chase or to be able to blow out quickly on next leg down.
409 2018-03-11 18:15:27 @SKIPDAWG A lot of stocks ripping now, including penny stocks however I don't suggest or trade these simply because of the high risk factor.

Girl - 

Guy to waiter - You must do SIP as well.

414 2018-03-11 18:11:33 Bump stocks are pointless, they make weapons very difficult to aim, and only increase fire rate. Sure, they should be banned, but it will solve nothing.
415 2018-03-11 18:11:16 So much faith in BJP! Does it mean those went out to vote are anti-BJP? Claimed 80% people of the country BJP supporters, RSS worshippers? So why 80% people from both the constituencies did not vote for BJP? Very human friendly leaders of BJP soon may run out of stocks of false..

417 2018-03-11 18:10:40 And why did trumps buddies dump their steel stocks the DAY BEFORE the announcement? #insidertrading
418 2018-03-11 18:08:52 Would banning bump stocks ever have stopped either in the past or future, a mad man from   ever doing harm to anyone with a gun? Same question with all your gun control agenda.

422 2018-03-11 18:05:14 Truthfully, it's my opinion that bump stocks are stupid and more of a novelty than anything else.  But it's not my right to tell someone they can't have one just because I don't share their views.

431 2018-03-11 18:02:41 Not sure if you're serious or kidding? The NRA buys off Republicans to vote against ANY limitations or restrictions on guns. Weapons of war, bump stocks & 30-round magazines = legal bc of #NRABloodMoney buying GOP votes. They represent manufacturers & defense contractors.
432 2018-03-11 18:02:19 Believe it or not, I tried to avoid popular stocks....everything else being the same.
433 2018-03-11 18:02:03 That's exactly what my impression was in the last couple of days. Literally no one capable of keeping it chill into t1. Best and cleanest racing I had so far was street stocks on this small oval surprisingly enough (stock content!)
434 2018-03-11 17:59:42 I've been meaning to research more on Abacus, I believe they allow you to buy stocks via their app that links directly to your CDS account. With such an option, I would move from my current stockbroker for good.

438 2018-03-11 17:57:58 @Swamy39 sir,around 9 years ago I was told to buy stocks of Shiva cement and the reason behind the stock to go up was karti chidambaram interest in the stock,interestingly that stock last year rose from 4 rs to 40 rs almost non stop..pls check 
439 2018-03-11 17:57:28 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
440 2018-03-11 17:56:28 Yep, not at all! Watching the weekly C&H, has a 50 point measured move on a b/o over ~75

443 2018-03-11 17:54:55 Dear Senator, don't waste your time using this verbiage. Bump stocks are now outdated tech. Concentrate on rounds per minute.
444 2018-03-11 17:54:26 In todays paper:"Feds act on bump stocks".  #MSDStrong It's working.  As I predicted your voices are being herd LOUD and Clear.  So proud of all of you.
445 2018-03-11 17:54:13 Stocks had a PE ratio of 6 to 8 in the 1940s with 100% debt to GDP ratio.  Today stocks have a significantly higher PE ratio of 20 to 35, depending on the calculation used with a debt to GDP ratio nearing 85%.

447 2018-03-11 17:53:40 You would better off contributing to a 401(k)plan rather stocks( volatile) 
the money is contributed before it is taxed and your employer may be matching your contribution with company money. 
A small downside to the employer contribution is that there may be a vesting schedule.
448 2018-03-11 17:50:53 @awealthofcs Ben, a few years back you wrote an article on Rick Ferri’s updated 60/40 and mentioned you’d do an follow on to Arends alternate 20//30/30/20.  Did you ever do that? You were concerned it might be too light on stocks. Thanks!
449 2018-03-11 17:50:31 does 2A protect modifications to firearms? or simply the right to have a firearm?
I've not interest in bump-stocks, and the only 2 reasons can think of that people may want 1 or more, is to have some fun on the range from time to time, or 2 hang it up for "just in case"
450 2018-03-11 17:50:03 I've had Trumpers say to me that brown ppl should be rounded up and shot; shout bigoted things to the direct faces of brown and black people;  say that gunz, pedo sports gods, stocks are more important than kids or people.

I live there. These ppl do NOT deserve political space.
451 2018-03-11 17:49:32 Stocks don't have a "debt to GDP" ratio.
452 2018-03-11 17:49:13 @FoxNews I target shot/hunt with mine! But hey, you see a scary black gun! BTW other guns with wooden stocks can shot just as fast as with the same bullets! So we should ban all guns! All “Semi Autos” That’s really where you’re going with this right? Why should we have guns?
453 2018-03-11 17:47:27 If we flex our stocks like a muscle they will grow.Repeat at morning and opening for one week.
454 2018-03-11 17:44:13 During WWII, what was the average PE on stocks in the US with over 100% debt to GDP ratio? Nowhere near the super inflated valuations that exist today, which also includes real estate.
455 2018-03-11 17:43:51 @number2TPACfan 
What lies...? Again-accusations & claims with ZERO support or evidence.

WHY is $TPAC such a great investment/trade?
What is time horizon to hold?
What company initiative drive your target price(s)?

You came here about $TPAC-not other stocks.
456 2018-03-11 17:43:28 We need to bring back the STOCKS!
457 2018-03-11 17:43:14 I’m am a true believer in 2nd Amendment. NRA member forever. I worry about ban on bump stocks. I am a legal class 3 weapons collector all with the required tax stamp. They are trying to make criminals out of people who bought these that is wrong.
458 2018-03-11 17:42:15 Some interesting stocks where people can do sip every month.
1. Canfin homes
2. Rpg life sciences
3. Suntv
4. Ashok Leyland
5. Ak capital
6. Gufic bio
7. Hatsun Agro 
Fundamentally very good stocks. Sip are best to accumlate these stocks
459 2018-03-11 17:41:34 @number2TPACfan 

Other stocks held really arent the issue though. You were claiming there has been a monumental shift at the core of $TPAC & refuse to build a case for WHY. Many consider that pumping. 

SHs that were lied to & manipulated by company & IR group arent bashing
460 2018-03-11 17:40:21 As such u can see my pinned tweet if u r doing SIP in stocks
461 2018-03-11 17:39:35 Try investing in stocks if you want to make money but maybe that’s out of your league.  I’ve made lots of money  in the last 12 months
462 2018-03-11 17:39:11 Collapsing, "it"s all over", valueless bitcoin is trending higher today, still over 50% above its low from a month ago. I bet Canadians are foaming at the mouth with their hair on fire, anxious for the markets to open, so they can continue selling crypto stocks at the lows.
463 2018-03-11 17:38:07 we have broken ever economic record, unemployment lower than ever, stocks higher than ever. Do you live in a cave? Americans are happy. Only wacko leftist that call for communism, yea communism are whining. Wh cares about them

465 2018-03-11 17:34:37 Forget the high yield savings account.  Invest in stocks that pay dividends.
466 2018-03-11 17:34:24 BTW - I think it's great that the U.S. will go a further $1.5 trillion into debt in order to benefit shareholders. About 30% of my portfolio is in U.S. stocks.
467 2018-03-11 17:33:20 You just proved Pascrell's point. Most of the Corp tax reform benefit will be returned to shareholders. The wealthiest 10% of U.S. households own 84% of stocks in the U.S. So most of the tax reform benefit will go to the wealthiest households in the U.S.
468 2018-03-11 17:33:02 Your question was already answered. No one on here is paid anything. We hold a variety of stocks, bonds, & other investments. Some are blue chip-some are OTC. Most are generally long to longer-term holds. Most on here arent short term traders.

So-Defend why $TPAC isa great trade
469 2018-03-11 17:33:00 Remember, When the Market Corrects, it’s the Big stocks that have been winners that get hurt the most.
470 2018-03-11 17:32:31 One of the important things in stocks is that a stock does not know that you own it. You have all these feelings about it; You remember what you paid. You remember who told you about it – all these little things. And it doesn’t give a damn. It just sits there.
471 2018-03-11 17:32:15 Every successful profitable long time trader (stocks or crypto) that I know, has a mindset & set of trading procedures (or methods) that are uniquely his or her own

And to continue, they never trade the same strategy in all markets. As markets (stocks or crypto) are always fluid

475 2018-03-11 17:30:20 Je pense qu'il y a peu de personnes pouvant se permettre de s'entrainer et de faire des stocks de munitions spécialisées hors de prix. Il faut rester réaliste. Sauf si on s'entraine 1 seule fois par mois, mais c'est alors irresponsable.

478 2018-03-11 17:28:38 As a 20 y/o student who wholeheartedly supports the spirit of cryptocurrency and believes in its future, does it make sense to own "traditional" securities (stocks, mutual funds) for any purpose other than a hedge?

482 2018-03-11 17:26:55 That’s good, hope paypal can help!! I’m more like hoping a bit that they still have more stocks, but i don’t think they will restock. I have 2 transactions that refunded last week, and I have 1 more. 
Also hoping they will not cancel my orders that are recorded.

484 2018-03-11 17:26:10 It doesn't make a gun fully automatic. If these are banned, a lot more than bump stocks can be bannned. You are aware that you don't need a bumpstock to fire most authentic weapons this way right?
485 2018-03-11 17:25:02 Steel tariffs are only going to create more bubble through by contracting investment opportunities in the same hypebolic tech stocks, they also will distort or churn WTO or NAFTA rule by other nations to work in their own advantage through retaliation
486 2018-03-11 17:24:35 It’s not full auto but it makes the gun act as such. I’m on your side I’m as pro gun as they come but bump stocks are unnecessary. Fun, but unnecessary.
487 2018-03-11 17:23:32 Huh? LMAO. I'm VERY clear about my positions - universal background checks on ALL gun sales; ban semi-automatic long rifles and handguns; and ban bump stocks, large magazines, and kevlar vests and other protective gear (except for law enforcement). No you can obfuscate . . .
488 2018-03-11 17:23:17 Bump stocks were never illegal

501 2018-03-11 17:13:16 I wanna get into stocks but the money seems too slow
502 2018-03-11 17:12:33 Wouldn't have? Bought stocks? I'm lost lmao

504 2018-03-11 17:11:20 My God how could Trump do this horror. Taxes lower on workers, companies coming back, stocks at record highs, unemployment way down. That Bastard. That wonderful Bastard!!!
505 2018-03-11 17:09:15 Bump stocks were illegal. Obama made them legal.

511 2018-03-11 17:04:04 typical New York lunch convo “do you use bitcoin?” “Have you followed the stocks?”
512 2018-03-11 17:03:29 FYI: According to Marketwatch's William Watts, "Stocks fell into a bear market between August and October of 2011 and again between May 19, 2015 and Feb. 6, 2016. So that would make the current bull just a shade over two years old."-And NOT 9 years old, as we have led to believe!
513 2018-03-11 17:01:36 Exactly right, David: Trump's followers think he is paving the roads with gold. Will end very badly with stocks and dollar way down.
514 2018-03-11 17:01:06 5/6 people wish Xiaomi will increase the stocks and flash sale may turn into open sale.
515 2018-03-11 17:01:04 Much sooner than anybody in stocks would like to believe
516 2018-03-11 17:00:29 If only my 401K/IRA and other stocks could grow this fast lol. Could you imagine if the winner gave a huge chunk to the public school system? It's sad to think, but it would put more pressure on Capitol Hill to institue flat raises state-to-state.
517 2018-03-11 17:00:26 ISIS lost 99% of the area they controlled under Obama that called them "JV". Tax Cuts are benefiting 85% of Americans, Stocks just happen to go up 35% in a year...accidental, nothing to do with policy...idiot. Jerusalem was/is the Capital...Trump had the balls to call what it is.
518 2018-03-11 17:00:19 I wonder if these same people tell Warren Buffett that he is a bad trader because he did not sell all of his stocks at the top of the market.

520 2018-03-11 16:59:16 With me it happened with the AMLT token (I think a week or so ago). Guess it corrects itself. By the way - any plans on adding the possibility to add regular stocks? And how about having fiat on your own bank instead of with an exchange?
521 2018-03-11 16:59:00 Does trading in Forex profitable or its just like stocks. You have to wait to see the benefits.
522 2018-03-11 16:58:45 Can’t wait for all of the self-proclaimed law-abiding gun owners to line up and turn in their bump stocks.  

Sales for bump stocks spiked after Las Vegas. Let’s see how really “law abiding” these people are.

531 2018-03-11 16:52:42 @jeffsessions This bump stock ban regulation is a violation of 26 U.S.C. 5845(b) and puts every accessory on the market at risk for "rate-increasing." Bump stocks are trash, but the regulation is bad for everyone under an anti-gun administration.
532 2018-03-11 16:52:16 dont you think on Friday stocks rates were free for many scripts
533 2018-03-11 16:51:31 But the AR *looks* more menacing, and that’s a large part of it. The hype works because the weapon looks the part. If I want to look like a badass I’ll choose the AR over a Mini-14, cuz woods stocks just don’t scare people. So much of this is about perception, not functionality.
534 2018-03-11 16:51:09 total bullshit nra propaganda that couldnt be further from reality no one needs an AR-15 even boar hunting the sport they keep bringing up could be done with another rifle or maybe a sega however the attack on bump stocks is totally unwarrented and designed to mislead the public

537 2018-03-11 16:45:40 Yep, that’s why I emphasized CAN. Growth stocks CAN work for youngsters too. If they latch onto one of those legendary stocks early, it can be life changing. Like most things in Investing, this is not a cut and dry issue. Much of it comes down to temperament of the practitioner.
538 2018-03-11 16:45:06 (2/2) I invest when I believe the conditions... are probably not permanent... you can't be short-term oriented with this investment philosophy. If you're going to worry about short-term volatility, you're just not going to be able to buy the cheapest stocks. -- Rich Pzena
539 2018-03-11 16:44:40 It can quite honestly happen. They don't like the ban on bump stocks so they could create a civil war over that even though Trump is initiating it.
540 2018-03-11 16:43:05 Invest in your future: stocks, properties, education, health , VUL-- NOT come-and-go trends like clothes and gadgets.

566 2018-03-11 16:28:55 I hope this doesn’t come across as moving the goalposts; my point about bump stocks and large mags in particular isn’t whether that would have prevented the shootings that already happened. More bullets fired faster will create more casualties.
567 2018-03-11 16:28:30 "Guns are safe
Stop falling for FAKE NEWS"--#QAnon

"#FalseFlags are #MisDirections and headline grabbers--#2A is safe"--#VT

Agree; but, #Sheeple will continue "falling for FAKE NEWS", so I suggest buying stocks in the guns and ammo sector e.g. $RGM--worked well for me!
568 2018-03-11 16:25:10 lol, doctor mommy is angry because now some party is calling the bluff of the so called elite pseudo-seculars. I would suggest go buy some burnol. The stocks would run out by 2019 :D

576 2018-03-11 16:15:35 Here's the issue with the "wealth transfer" - so much of Boomer wealth is locked up in housing, as as well as overpriced stocks and bonds. The Boomers still need to live on that. I'm very skeptical of the idea of a massive intergenerational wealth transfer.

578 2018-03-11 16:13:58 Last week I glanced through the charts of the entire list of stocks listed on the NSE (yes, entire). I like to do it once in a while to get a handle on how the broader market looks like.
579 2018-03-11 16:13:20 Which do you find is the best website or app to track stocks and shares? No text found
580 2018-03-11 16:12:53 When a weapon can shoot 40 rounds per minute without the additions like bump stocks, that sound like an assault rifle to me.  What kind of game are you going to hunt to need to shoot 40 bullets a min, except humans?  Dana.  We are not stupid.  We know what you are spinning. 
581 2018-03-11 16:11:44 Nearly every. And he did. To make the modifications he did to the rifle used and all the other guns he had in his possession would have taken a lot of law breaking. The modifications made to the firearm besides bump stocks were all illegal, all mods you can’t legally acquire....
582 2018-03-11 16:11:16 Good point, but in the case of a deranged madman his objective is not accuracy, his objective is mass infliction. But I'm not a gun expert so if your opinion is the bump stock is a non issue than you may be right. But again the 2 amendment doesn't blanket cover bump stocks.
583 2018-03-11 16:11:08 I wonder what would happen if all of the victims of AR-15s filed a federal lawsuit against the manufactures for selling military grade weapons to civilians?
I wonder what would happen if the victims in Las Vegas filed a lawsuit against the manufacture of bump stocks?
584 2018-03-11 16:09:47 And if you leverage that with short and long options instead of stocks, your chances grow up.
585 2018-03-11 16:08:35 US has 10x population of Canada and 10x the mass shooting incidents since 65. Difference is there isnt the same semi-autos and bump stocks  etc here.  Lower casualties.  Those guns should be banned for sure

597 2018-03-11 16:02:12 Again you have your facts wrong, Donnie. Most mass shooters have not been Muslim. All the crime is not caused by immigrants. All guns are designed to do is kill things, animals, people. Banning assault weapons and bump stocks does not violate the 2nd Amendment.
598 2018-03-11 16:01:17 Interesting to consider that there probably was never enough evidence of collusion to matter for this administration but from their own carelessness they’re potentially facing obstruction (Comey) and now insider trading (Icahn selling steel stocks).

603 2018-03-11 15:55:59 Agree that Bioenergy could increase atmospheric stocks but not the biosphere. Only new previously sequestered CO2 from buried hydrocarbons can do that. While bioenergy has shortcomings, it’s still important remember that it is fundamentally different than fossil fuels.
604 2018-03-11 15:54:32 Actually since you give such strong support to the ADA, you must obviously be totally in favor of not banning bump stocks. They were invented to help disabled Americans target shoot & hunt. So they are under the ADA umbrella.
605 2018-03-11 15:54:21 Have you even read those answers? It isn't mentioned once that private companies sell stocks. You really need to explain yourself better because you don't appear to have much of a clue on what you're talking about.

614 2018-03-11 15:47:58 True but there are missteps which could backfire - attacking 2nd amendment & amnesty of DACA. PA election will reflect on that. If he can ban Bump stocks thru an executive order then the next Dem Prez could ban a class of weapons & ammo. He has set a dangerous precedent!
615 2018-03-11 15:47:54 the eu has been a disaster for fishing stocks & marine conservation. we should take our lead from norway/greenland etc. to improve stocks and make sure eu boats have no access to waters unless they pay loads and comply with new regs.
616 2018-03-11 15:46:13 Fantastic report that explains the YTD indexes in Asia & EU at 4-12 months lows. US is not an island but is being viewed that way for now.

617 2018-03-11 15:46:06 I just thought the @baltimoresun headline "Justice Department proposes banning bump stocks" was "Justice Deparment proposes banning socks." And was like, huh. Okay. Sounds about right, all things considered.
618 2018-03-11 15:45:23 Sounds to me like hundreds of thousands of sixers fans are confusing "process" with "results." Anyone whose "plan" is to lose, perpetually, until you magically don't anymore, should be run out of town on a rail. Hinkie should be put in the stocks.

622 2018-03-11 15:44:30 The way I see it - downside for both is the same - both stocks and cryptocurrencies can wipe out 60 - 80% of value, but stocks in general don't have the same potential upside.
623 2018-03-11 15:44:23 What about other rifles? How do you justify banning one brand of rifles? I think some people reasonably believe this leads to a ban on all rifles. Then next its handguns. Where will it end? 17 individuals can be killed with handguns. Banning bump stocks is reasonable.

644 2018-03-11 15:28:44 Not really, all you get is worse income inequality, plus more government spending that increases the national debt. Which as of now is over $20 trillion.

647 2018-03-11 15:26:07 I'll bet a lot of men are scarfing up all the bump stocks they can find now, to sell on the black market at a very high profit when they are banned all over.  It's their mentality.
648 2018-03-11 15:25:59 So, let's say we get them AT THE LEAST ban bump stocks.

I'd like to know how many have already been sold.

How do we get them back?
If we try to.

There could be hundreds of thousands of them out there.
649 2018-03-11 15:24:03 Amen, brother. And these mass shootings = brisk business for the fun stores and manufacturers. I live a short walk from Mandalay Bay. Bump stocks were FLYING off the shelves, after our #massshooting.

21 or 18? Bump stocks? #NRA doesn't care. These will change little & are small incremental issues but NRA will fight these skirmishes like each one is a Waterloo to keep us from the heart of the matter...the #2ndAMD.
#NRA uses "the Law".  So we must change the law.

659 2018-03-11 15:14:32 He's already banned bump stocks, is pushing for a ban on buying under 21, and wants to grab guns without due process. Sounds like there's no "unless" left here, Mike.
660 2018-03-11 15:11:04 You called me a sore loser because I want to ban bump stocks. How does that make any sense?
661 2018-03-11 15:10:41 remember when the Democrats tried to boycott the companies that support the NRA but they just ended up causing those companies stocks to skyrocket and NRA memberships increase by 500,000? I do, good times
662 2018-03-11 15:09:03 Mass shootings are the work of undisciplined young people? How do you explain Las Vegas, Sutherland? If you’re right, then banning assault weapons, banning bump stocks, tightening loopholes, raising age to 21, universal background checks and mental health $ should help, right?

666 2018-03-11 15:06:35 With stocks rich & ROI low, the shareholder friendly answer is large one-time dividends. Doing that avoids overpaying for stock, throwing money at bad opportunities or "locking in" future dividend obligations. But, while good for shareholders, not as good optics for management.

Also, crypto stocks scans are available now as you mentioned and I have been having some great profit alerts from them the past month. both long & short.
668 2018-03-11 15:05:19 Want legislation that mandates a specific rate of fire(instead of just banning automatics), and applying that to bump stocks. Another thing might be that factory issue magazines can only hold 10 rounds, with special rules to slowly phase out high capacity magazines with buybacks.

680 2018-03-11 14:54:14 No where in the 2 amendment does it mention the right to own assault rifles, bump stocks, magazines enabling a 1 person army. In those days they had muskets maybe shoot 1 every minute if they were good. 2nd amendment has been desecrated to fit gun lobby interest.

696 2018-03-11 14:39:56 Do you think he invested in stocks and mutual funds as well or is he just being careful with his money? I can’t imagine that he was totally careful b/c of the damage done to it in the first avengers and age of ultron . Or is he just that rich?

707 2018-03-11 14:33:16 Good morning Mr. President. I see the extra hour of sunshine has not brightened your mood. For what it's worth, I like your position on bump stocks. Coming from a left-leaning liberal, that should make you smile.

714 2018-03-11 14:27:43 Okay, guy. I can agree with you about the bump stocks but disagree about calling them a terrorist organization or comparing them to isis. Not even the same f’n sport. Sensationalism. 

I’m curious, are you trying to sway people who may be on the fence about gun issues?

728 2018-03-11 14:21:18 So you advocate for Bump Stocks and other modifications to AR1-15 and AK-47 to make nearly fully automatic and Magazine that holds 30 to 100 rounds. You must have a latent desire to kill a large group of humans or animals without reloading. Sickening after Vegas mass killing.
729 2018-03-11 14:19:18 I see.  
he bought his gun legally. 

ban bump stocks
ban weapons of war
universal background checks
no loopholes, none. 

we have to try.  Anyone who isn't willing to TRY, needs to examine why not?  Why would they not be willing to TRY and stop these killings.

730 2018-03-11 14:16:38 Its called stocks
731 2018-03-11 14:15:09 Answer: too many gun owners would totally flip out. Just amend to apply to modern times with auto weapons, magazine clips, bump stocks, thorough background cks,close gunshow loopholes, etc. Ask neighbor what they want. Too bad the @GOP cannot help.
732 2018-03-11 14:14:18 But doesn't the red line need to drop near the 20% or 130 area before a significant correction in stocks? Latest is still  around 40% and 300
733 2018-03-11 14:14:06 Will the market uncertainty caused by introducing Tariffs create cheap stocks to invest in?

744 2018-03-11 14:08:36 I dunno about fundamentals but if tariff threats and bond yields going up haven't stopped stocks rising, not sure if anything stopping this from continuing onwards
745 2018-03-11 14:06:50 I sure hope it won't be one more. I thought post 08 might see a inflation hedge bubble. Where all the questionably precious white metals & stocks take part. It sure looked like it in 2011 but as soon as the public muttered bubble, it collapsed.
746 2018-03-11 14:05:54 Bring back public HANGINGS! Aso, bring back the stocks!
747 2018-03-11 14:05:25 #economy looks excellent: #Job market humming, inflation low, #TaxReform to lift supply-side. So what are the risks? Biggest risk for me is the #Fed. I actually heard some economists talking about 5 rate hikes this year. That is absurd unless the goal is to sink #stocks
748 2018-03-11 14:05:05 John Redwood was telling Brits during the referendum how great it would be to leave the EU. After the vote he told his investment clients to sell out of British stocks because he knew it was bad news for UK business. He financially benefits from a weak Britain.
749 2018-03-11 14:04:23 He also tried to conflate bump stocks with MSD shooting by crediting the kids....one had nothing to do with the other
750 2018-03-11 14:02:20 Yes Gillian, it's available at stores only while stocks last.
751 2018-03-11 14:01:41 regulating guns and bump stocks will do nothing to stop the sin of Murder
752 2018-03-11 14:00:28 @realDonaldTrump MR President, please stop saying bump stocks turn a rifle in to a machine gun!
You KNOW a bump stock still only allows ONE bullit fired for every trigger pull!

754 2018-03-11 13:58:40 Huge #fail, and most don't see why yet.
Categorizing bump stocks as machineguns means BATFE violated 922(o) machinegun ban when Obama admin ruled them legal. Now 922(o) is at serious risk of judicial review; _Heller_ said M16 ban was unconstitutional, M16s will be legalized.
755 2018-03-11 13:58:20 I know a girl who can handle those stocks. Call 1800McGrids snd ask for Gunther.
756 2018-03-11 13:56:35 Remember: conceding bump stocks costs the NRA virtually nothing, but is used as a sop to the gun control crowd in order to satisfy them with something, and prevent addressing the real gun issues. Standard negotiating ploy.

758 2018-03-11 13:53:55 Why do you care if Bump stocks (which are unnecessary) are taken away?
759 2018-03-11 13:53:29 Tariffs may or may not impact stocks but they WILL hurt the American consumer. We have reams of data on this and tariffs hurt Americans.
760 2018-03-11 13:52:55 Where is it written hat you have rights to bump stocks?

774 2018-03-11 13:39:48 1st, No one is trying to confiscate guns. Really. What else is there to say? Regulating the sale of things like bump stocks or regulating the sale of guns to mentally disturbed people is not confiscating anything. Your argument is typical but ridiculous.
775 2018-03-11 13:39:24 probably sugar stocks crashing in expectation of same, did you inform it earlier to HNIs

793 2018-03-11 13:23:27 It's time to end the bloodshed brought upon by reckless gun policies. And it's time to save American lives by banning assault/military type weaponry and bump stocks; require background checks for all who purchase a gun no matter where or from whom.

804 2018-03-11 13:16:18 The great thing about banks is: you don’t actually own the money once you deposit. They WILL lend out 98% legally through fractional reserve policy. They will bet highly leveraged stocks and give you almost a full fraction of 1% of the proceeds. Not to mention  the wars they fund
805 2018-03-11 13:11:45 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
806 2018-03-11 13:11:38 There's no way SCOTUS will reverse a ban on bump stocks.  They've thrice in 3 years refused to reverse restrictions on assault weapons.

810 2018-03-11 13:07:30 An ever-bountiful source of entertainment, Trump. One would prefer a Leader who isn’t a clown, but he’s just there to distract everyone while Paul Ryan robs the cookie jar and Mike Pence procures the chastity belts and installs stocks in every town square!

820 2018-03-11 13:01:34 You know why tuna stocks in the North Sea fell? Because UK overfishing. It'll be more than 50 years before stocks reach a level where UK waters could meet even half current UK demand for tuna. Same with cod (recall the cod wars?). And again, we import more prawns than UK waters.
821 2018-03-11 13:00:37 I’m still so happy about last night’s dnd session. Everyone except the rogue boi Peanut got put in the stocks and now they have to avoid horrible punishment. What a time to be alive.

830 2018-03-11 12:45:25 Being in favor of common-sense gun regulations such as banning military-grade weapons like the AR-15, high-capacity magazines, and bump stocks, closing loopholes, and requiring stronger background checks, is not inconsistent with hiring an armed bodyguard.
831 2018-03-11 12:45:23 She inflames from the first statement. Most are NOT anti-gun. We just want the “AR 15 style rifles” and bump stocks banned - not all guns!
832 2018-03-11 12:43:02 Potential for serious corruption was implicit in Trump’s pres bid. We have had wealthy presidents before.

840 2018-03-11 12:37:30 I see an overwhelming need to stay in the stock market and a repulsion towards safety as a guaranteed return that is just too low. To me only a huge decline in stocks changes the feeling.
841 2018-03-11 12:36:55 It banned bump stocks, raised the age requirement and armed non teacher personel. The NRA filed a suit against the age requirement. A law that arms lunch ladies, bans something that wasnt used in Parkland and is already contested.
842 2018-03-11 12:35:27 Sure they can.  Bump stocks are an accessory - like silencers, they can be regulated and banned.

4. Magazine limits.

Fundamentals are same as 40 days back for most of the stocks but are now at attractive levels
857 2018-03-11 12:20:31 One of the reasons that can be considered is whether the stocks themselves did not have momentum, or moved them when they were buds? Was the temperature steeply increased and steamed? Did you have too much difference in temperature? It will be considered.
858 2018-03-11 12:20:04 Name calling and like thought, keep that going you all are losing at what is really happening! How's your pay check? How are your stocks? How's your 401K?

878 2018-03-11 11:50:04 A feels good but useless left wing regulatory waste of time.  Bump stocks are the kind of accuracy degrading, ammo wasting device I would prefer my attacker to use were I ever unfortunate enough to be attacked.

883 2018-03-11 11:37:48 Lost two last stock last hit sets and went 0-4 in pools.
Then lost round 1 winners in amateurs.
Then ran all the way back from losers round 1 to amateur grand finals.
Also brought Avalancer to last stock both 0% in pools game 1 (2 stocks high% game 2).

What even is this game
884 2018-03-11 11:37:17 @BMTheEquityDesk Are `Chakri' stocks just smallcap in nature or can they be mid or/and largecaps too?
885 2018-03-11 11:37:14 I also thought promoting stocks whilst selling at same time was market abuse

888 2018-03-11 11:35:12 I’ll never forget all the time you gave me to discuss penny stocks. So generous.
889 2018-03-11 11:34:09 Taking a new approach to buying old vinyl going forward, multiple record store owners, some I have been doing business with for over 30 years, have told me if you see a LP you like buy it now if its decent. Stocks of good Metal and Punk are evaporating and may never come back.
890 2018-03-11 11:34:05 UK is a net importer of fish. We could be self-sufficient after we leave. If fish stocks will sustain further activity, we could allow EU boats in our waters under our rules. Limited days at sea, no discards, all fish to be landed and processed in UK. All good for our economy.
891 2018-03-11 11:32:15 That's the beauty of the system makes us take away our predictive powers and only follows the trend. Just that sometimes these stocks become the last beacons of hope for a bull market

895 2018-03-11 11:29:14 Here is how they will appeal. They are going to say that bump stocks are used by the disabled. and they will cite the ADA. This is what they did last time.

897 2018-03-11 11:26:48 African penguins are dying out. Fish stocks up the West Coast have dropped catastrophically. Overfishing and climate change related shifts of populations.
898 2018-03-11 11:25:12 Asian countries are always like this though. Japan overtakes Tuna stocks to the point where traditional Tuna fisherman don't practice anymore because of stock loss. Take so many whales, even though Japanese can't afford to eat it.. and then there's this from China.

900 2018-03-11 11:24:34 You mean stocks, which are currently experiencing massive bubble or bonds with petty fixed annual yield and unlimited potential downside?
901 2018-03-11 11:17:22 Agree. Most ALTs (especially mid-cap) have not surpassed their June/July highs on a BTC comparative.

People like market cycles but they need to go look at stocks like Yahoo and Cisco. They still haven't hit their dot-com bubble highs.
902 2018-03-11 11:15:45 If you follow my SHP disclosures & BUY stocks, my humble request.

I am always ready to first lose. My best investment performance was in stocks where I lost at least one-third notionally. Often, multibaggers first lost up to 50%.
So, pl don’t buy them and hurt yourself. And, me.
903 2018-03-11 11:13:22 Complete lack of understanding of fiat.  You simply have to hold your fiat in investments (stocks, bonds, businesses, etc.) that generate a positive real rate of return.  Fiat is inflationary is to generate spending.  Deflationary currencies generate HODLing e.g. BTC.
904 2018-03-11 11:11:45 Perks of an asset class in it's nascent stage. Most small cap and mid cap stocks globally have similar characteristics. It's the relatively low volume and retail investors who cause this to happen

908 2018-03-11 11:00:49 Has California banned bump stocks ?
909 2018-03-11 11:00:32 NRA opposes both of these. They also oppose a full ban on bump stocks. They oppose ANYTHING that sells fewer guns.

If you want ANY common sense regulation, you oppose the NRA.

956 2018-03-11 09:50:57 Nice try, but thats, 1; a single bottom feeding species that's already been linked to profiting to bye-catch, and 2; its arguable whether its because of the CFP that fish stocks are so good. 
Point is, if you weren't using a TAC based system, what would you put in its place?
957 2018-03-11 09:50:54 Watched the video and enjoyed the clarity. Something that wasn't mentioned was bump stocks. Wasn't that one of the main issues?

980 2018-03-11 09:15:16 Agreed, based on market volatility and current @GOP taxation, we can expect a repeat of the Reagan and Bush recessions. Corporations are using the current tax reductions to buy back stocks and consolidate ownership just like before. The worst is yet to come.

990 2018-03-11 08:55:41 No not at all.

The ancient man was a hunter and gatherer which meant they roamed as stocks deplete. Therefore, different races occupied different parts of the world at different times and this study is consistent with that.

992 2018-03-11 08:54:02 And like pixie dust, such a regulation will make all of the bump stocks already sold disappear and all the bad guys magically become good guys! Only in fantasyland!
993 2018-03-11 08:50:37 How do people who don’t have stocks benefit from stock market? Because i don’t get it. Trump base is talking about stock market like they own a lot of stocks.
994 2018-03-11 08:50:36 What crimes has President Trump  committed? Zero. President Trump  is doing a great job. He is keeping his campaign promises, stocks are up, unemployment is down, our military is getting stronger, he defends the constitution.
995 2018-03-11 08:49:31 Bitrex not supporting because they take forked coins themselves... No other reasons cannot exist. US stocks are always greedy and try to get customers in line to obey... Because regulations are going to appeal in the law. Self defense.
996 2018-03-11 08:49:02 Half of all US households don’t own stocks. Most tax break money is going towards buybacks and dividends. Great if you’re wealthy
997 2018-03-11 08:48:39 Very odd comments.

998 2018-03-11 08:48:27 Is it either logical or reasonable that anyone could find Growth Stocks with an effort no harder than reading a few simply worded brokers' free circulars in the comfort of an armchair one evening a week?
999 2018-03-11 08:46:02 If inflation is for real, rates won’t matter. Investors will be buying real property hand over fist like tech stocks in the dotcom bubble.
1000 2018-03-11 08:44:04 Because many of the fish stocks are shared, the UK would have to agree quotas with the EU.

1004 2018-03-11 08:41:20 Its the longer rather than the short economic run that will tell if the few things that sound good hold. My stocks are better and holding. But I hear my 2019 exempt losses will cost me. Most people don’t own stock and wages are still only1% up.

@LordMix__ By far the best Bowser Main during your prime. You did extremely well against matchups that other Bowsers could hardly take stocks off of and beat many of them(VoiD,ScAtt, Fatality, Wrath) and when you didnt you took them to last hit
1021 2018-03-11 08:07:46 Saw a report on Sky yesterday about fishing stocks in Seychelles being decimated by ships from EU using high tech search equipment. Little left for locals. There needs to be controls on these ships that travel so far and over fish. At least we might be able to protect our seas.

1034 2018-03-11 07:50:15 Blame violent video games (which are vile), failure to enforce existing laws, or mental health defects, etc. obfuscates the real culprit: guns in the hands of morons that kill.  Real solutions: no AK47s, background checks, no bump stocks, limited bullet magazines.
1035 2018-03-11 07:47:48 One comment, Stocks have not ignored the so called political turmoil  & news is making Trading Volatility Great Again...It's A Trading Market but still Bullish.

1049 2018-03-11 07:28:22 The @NRA should recognize the political climate and take a role leading the conversation on #guncontrol. Try axing some lownhanging fruit, like hi-cap mags & bump stocks, put a 10 year sunset clause in it, and see what it does in 10 years. Then use the political capital...
1050 2018-03-11 07:27:58 Oh, and my whole point in replying was that even my Vietnam Vet dad, who has a concealed carry permit, thinks that there needs to be limits to ARs, bump stocks, and armor piercing bullets. Little by little I hope we take our country back from the lunatic fringe (aka NRA).

1086 2018-03-11 06:32:08 .@whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. Instead, insist on clean reciprocity!

1090 2018-03-11 06:29:06 When teachers in elementary school would talk about the Great Depression and the “stock market crashing”, I thought that the market was literally a truck that went around and sold stocks, held money, etc. &
the the Depression could have been avoided if the truck didn’t “crash.”
1091 2018-03-11 06:27:47 I know these weapons well. Semi-auto, long rifles with a retractable stock and pistol grip are easy as hell to shoot. Ergonomic. Adding bump stocks and 30 rounds mags, they serve only one purpose and should not be in the hands of civilians.
1092 2018-03-11 06:27:42 Good time to invest in quality stocks when everyone is scared and running away.
1093 2018-03-11 06:23:05 Dude we only get discount on stocks

Limiting the 2A to CONCEALED firearms and banning bump stocks doesn’t take your freedom or the right to protect yourself!

1103 2018-03-11 06:18:11 Five months after bump stocks were used in the murder of 58 people the NRA gave trump permission to ban bump stocks in order to protect their more lucrative assault weapons sales. Sorry, no medal for trump. (See my previous post for the Obama DOJ on bump stocks.) Good night.

1135 2018-03-11 05:36:47 Bump stocks and 100 round drums make mass slaughter easier. If they aren't worth discussing than you'd have no problem banning them.
And by all means regulate guns like cars.
1136 2018-03-11 05:34:05 Any portfolio at some time could drop 25-50 percent of its value, however good the stocks may be. This is a reality of fundamental investing.

1138 2018-03-11 05:30:21 This group was responsible a lot of the property index performance. On my numbers if you didn’t own you did 9% and if  you owned the index (and these stocks) you did 14% (both annualised over 5 years). So large underperformance and investors move money to funds that are “better”
1139 2018-03-11 05:30:16 Stocks are gonna rose for these two ! All heart ! #GarciaLipinets

1143 2018-03-11 05:28:08 Bumps stocks are legal and background checks aren’t required so “talking” isn’t the goal anymore. Making sure gun whores like Carmine lose at the ballot is the goal.

1146 2018-03-11 05:23:50 No ONE WANTS TO REPEAL THE 2ND AMENDMENT!!!
THE BAN REQUEST IS FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS FROM BEING SOLD.
Age limit to 21
Universal background checks.

IS AN ASSAULT RIFLE WORTH
EVEN 1 LIFE? 
CHILD OR ADULT?
THEIR SMILE, LAUGHTER, LOVE FAMILY, FRIENDS!!!
IS IT???
1147 2018-03-11 05:20:53 Then offer a bill to ban bump stocks. A single purpose bill - no additional items, no amendments - would probably pass easily & quickly. Then what? There are thousands already out there. Are you going to confiscate them? Good luck with that.
1148 2018-03-11 05:20:00 I have some of the bump stocks. Are they going to buy them back? If not they are not getting mine.
1149 2018-03-11 05:15:19 We are watching the Market Makers adjust their inventory Buy/Sell Stocks &  institutional traders on the secret exchange buy or sell ONLY!
1150 2018-03-11 05:15:01 hey @KyleKashuv , what parts of the NRA's positions on guns or policies do you find yourself disagreeing with? For example, raising the age, types of weapons, bump stocks, etc..?  Thanks!
1151 2018-03-11 05:13:48 TVNZ news: Bumb stocks to be banned
Oh, please guys.....did nobody check that?
1152 2018-03-11 05:13:30 Present model was developed by British during WWII to control food stocks to ensure supplies to troops - objective was to avoid repetition of bad situation like Bengal Famine. Food security doesnt mean Govt owns stocks - it means enough food stocks shall be dr within supply line
1153 2018-03-11 05:12:55 7 hrs after watching #BlackPanther I have come to realise that the market discounts stocks like $DIS because it realises that companies like that need to keep making smash hits year after year just to maintain their valuations. Similar discount applies to $aapl.
1154 2018-03-11 05:12:51 Market Makers need to adjust their inventory stocks. They see what is going on advanced orders etc on secret exchange & adjust supply/demand
1155 2018-03-11 05:11:03 we need a model of storages in villages itself where farmers can keep their grains and trade stocks in farmers trading exchange no need for mandis or Govt controlled storages--such storages can be build in PPP model between Govt and Panchayats --

1158 2018-03-11 05:09:22 So we don’t care if half of America had their stocks go up? That’s absurd! Everybody or bust! Geronimo!!
1159 2018-03-11 05:09:03 Because the richest 10% of Americans own 84% of the stock market. They make money buying the bonds the government sells to cover debts for tax cuts that aren’t funded. Plus, when the markets crash and tank 401Ks the rich swoop in and buy back the stocks. Rigged system.

Stop riling up people that have no clue about trading to attack this man without, at least, the benefit of doubt.

1163 2018-03-11 05:04:56 I feel like I should buy a lottery card or invest in stocks when one of your favs gets discontinued. There must be some patterning or algorithm behind why this keeps happening and we should at least be making bank from it 
1164 2018-03-11 05:03:12 And every time an NRA supporter backs them on one or more of these ridiculous stances (semi-auto’s for all, 21’s too old, high cap mags and bump stocks are a-ok) they are undermining their own cause of maintaining gun rights for law abiding gun owners.
1165 2018-03-11 05:01:37 goofy girls are the best girls. y’all sleep on us tho cause our roast game is ruthless
1166 2018-03-11 04:57:44 So I suspect bump stocks will require registration, $200 tax and approval like any other Class III? News talks about “illegal machine guns” when all it takes is paperwork and $200 in revenue for the government and VOILA!  you too can own and operate an automatic weapon!
1167 2018-03-11 04:56:43 Every time I come home my dad stocks up on muffins, cookies, and ice cream! 
1168 2018-03-11 04:55:45 They also invest in private companies based on insider info which is bigger than stocks sales bc it leads to govt contracts and easier to hide - insider trading is bad but this exponentially increased private Corp & govt contracts is astounding think TARP & green energy companies
1169 2018-03-11 04:54:22 Now that Twitter seems to be owned by Common Sense Media, has anyone looked at their stocks?

a) you buy Fixed Income either explicitly or through “derivative hedges” to do market timing

b) you increase active share and only hold stocks where you still perceive opportunity

c) stick to your style and let investors do the market timing themselves

I like b.
1177 2018-03-11 04:44:35 only stocks. Don’t know options well. but if options is your thing and sounds like you just joined AoT, all I can tell you I have seen many members trade Stewie’s trades using options. You’re in good hands. He wants to see people succeed, members or otherwise.

1192 2018-03-11 04:34:28 Bump stocks are rarely seen on the streets. They are really impractical because of the inability to maintain accurate aim.
1193 2018-03-11 04:33:58 That's because many members of Congress use their positions to invest in stocks that are in their various oversight committees and also swap that information with other members of Congress.

1202 2018-03-11 04:26:23 Define..."common sense gun laws". Ex. US Federal law that prohibits the selling, or possession of bump stocks, or anything else that turns a semi-auto into a machine gun.

Tragic as those are, aimed semiautomatic fire at 1 shot per second should have killed ±900. The bump stocks prevented a massacre & 21,090 who were not hurt are lucky he used bump stocks.
1206 2018-03-11 04:18:37 We need to push the age for gun ownership to 21, eliminate bump stocks, and make sure that background mental health checks are given every three years from the time ownership begins! #NoBumpStocks #GunReform #NRABloodMoney #BanBumpStocks #GunControlNow #2ndAmendmentReform

1208 2018-03-11 04:17:36 Do the gun nuts who claim the left is meddling with the constitution know what an amendment is? It's a change to the constitution! The founders of the country didn't anticipate semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks.
1209 2018-03-11 04:14:15 Don't really care about bump stocks...but the 21 year old limit is crap & useless.
1210 2018-03-11 04:13:07 With all of this gun violence talk and banning bump stocks, etc... and the young kids shooting up schools and they blame it on mature video games, well what about young boys that play with these modable nerf guns. Those could also be a problem with shooting imaginary people etc..
1211 2018-03-11 04:12:42 That sounded delish and now that apple butter has me yerning omfg. There's this church nearby that sells some homemade apple butter every year and my family just stocks up on jars after jars. It's so goooood

1216 2018-03-11 04:10:45 @realDonaldTrump has actually taken a moral stance to limit bump stocks and sales of assault weapons to kids 18- to 21 years of age.
1217 2018-03-11 04:10:00 @CatherineWBRC bump stocks DO NOT turn semiautomatic firearms into automatic firearms. PLEASE attempt basic research.
1218 2018-03-11 04:09:43 We’ll bump stocks are a start even if a small step forward. Very small.
1219 2018-03-11 04:09:08 Tell me again how mass shootings are being carried out with handguns. The fort hood shooter, the Dallas shooter, the Parkland shooter...maybe when the CDC is funded to investigate gun violence those statistics can be brought to light. Until then, kiss bump stocks and ARs buh bye.

1241 2018-03-11 03:48:17 i'm sorry, your pat (yourselves) on the back politics is hard to swallow. you did not address the guns! Australia did what you would not. you merely addressed bump stocks. come on! you never talk about the guns. is it because of the NRA? #NeverAgain
1242 2018-03-11 03:45:33 LW: During a Cabinet meeting Thursday, Trump vowed that a ban on bump stocks as a legal item in the U.S. was almost "finished."
1243 2018-03-11 03:44:05 Please just make sure that there is enough stocks. @XiaomiIndia is facing lot of criticize due to lack of stock.
1244 2018-03-11 03:41:33 I’m sorry you feel this way. He is blocking bump stocks. Plus, going to source of problem. Families, video games. Kids don’t have social graces. Bullies! God open their eyes.

1247 2018-03-11 03:35:36 It's is the states right to form a militia and regulate it. Whether it's age restriction, banning of bump stocks, requiring a class, or keeping semi/automatic rifles in the hands of professionals, it is the states right to determine how it wants to regulate its "militia"
1248 2018-03-11 03:33:51 Also the daily webinars at 5pm ET are free. Mostly all discussions on stocks during webinars are swing related.

1250 2018-03-11 03:30:33 Fund managers are leaving domestic stocks and investing $$$$ in international markets.
1251 2018-03-11 03:30:14 I think the problem you have is that some ignorant people are egging you on when all you will get is what was going to happen anyway.Obama gave bump stocks and they were going away. All you "survivors" will lose the Obama mandate to keep you out of jail for the crimes you commit.
1252 2018-03-11 03:30:13 yea i wish there’s no delay this time, also more stocks, they underestimated armys smh

1258 2018-03-11 03:26:34 I like your way of thinking a lot! Keep going, it's a good strategy to allocate a portion of your capital gain into a dividend portfolio. It forces you to diversify and not reinvest all your gain into stocks and risk to lose all of them 
1259 2018-03-11 03:25:15 It’s like what prince William in the UK don’t just address the gun problem, go back even farther beyond the bump stocks and banning certain things and not other things. A longer waiting period, higher age, and full extensive background check why can’t that happen?
1260 2018-03-11 03:24:56 If people are going to legislate rights away, know what the hell your talking about! Throwing stats out like 28 School shootings since 2018 or 30000 homicides due to gun violence or bump stocks make your ARs fully auto and they can shoot 1000 rounds s minute! Yep liberal BS!
1261 2018-03-11 03:24:33 Something is going on where the NRA in the 20th century were for gun control laws, under President Obama the NRA was for banning Bump Fire Stocks but now they are not.
1262 2018-03-11 03:23:44 the rifle doesnt bother me, but there is no need for bump stocks at all.
1263 2018-03-11 03:23:15 This is called the "equity premium". There's a lot of literature on it. The basic answers are 1. stocks involve more risk than lower return investments. 2. no one's really sure beyond that.
1264 2018-03-11 03:22:37 that would be the case it seems f bump stocks makes a gun shoot like an automatic it should never have been allowed to be sold automatic weapons have been illegal in america for a long long long time but always remember GUNS NEVER KILL its always a person who does the killing
1265 2018-03-11 03:22:19 And don’t forget the bump stocks—Heaven forfend Flake should ban work to bump stocks. Or assault weapons. Or to implement background checks. Or to save net neutrality. But hey, tariffs, man.
1266 2018-03-11 03:22:18 Interesting that under the Obama Administration the NRA actually asked the Justice Dept if Bump Fire Stocks were legal after a high exposed shooting with one. Why now has the NRA turned a different foot?
1267 2018-03-11 03:19:16 McDonalds now has a vegan option and it’s free! It’s called the air and water meal! Get down to your local McDonalds today to try for free! While stocks last
1268 2018-03-11 03:18:26 I just invested 900$ into stocks. Possibly the worst/best decision I’ll make

1270 2018-03-11 03:17:55 Why bump stocks? The stocks don’t kill people, the gun don’t kill people, the bullets don’t kill people, PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE!!! Yes it’s good to ban the stocks but what is that going to do the 18 yr old can still buy a gun and wait for it, SHOOT PEOPLE,age limits and waintn.....

1277 2018-03-11 03:11:29 There are very few energy pundits left.  As much as the stocks are down, so is the professional coverage.  It's like asking a Toyota dealer if he recommends buying a VW.  When he says no, point to the advice as proof why buying VW is a bad idea.
1278 2018-03-11 03:10:54 That’s fine...bump stocks are gay anyway IMO
1279 2018-03-11 03:08:29 it wouldnt be ideal to have for your mian broker, but can be a great asset to a short seller especially being that they have had shorts on a lot of stocks people have had trouble getting with unlimited shares no fees and no ssr
1280 2018-03-11 03:07:28 Who gives a shit about these so called bump stocks anyway?
1281 2018-03-11 03:07:02 All in $spy
1282 2018-03-11 03:04:57 @GlennFife and others should check out @Tr3ndyCharts new chat and video room. Room is very educational and answers specific questions on stocks/options people may have quickly.
1283 2018-03-11 03:03:31 Yes. some stock arent available to be traded like some otc stocks and stuff, but for the most part they are and if it tradeable then its shortable also no locate or short fees..no ssr.. you really wouldnt know the diff. they follow same price action.
1284 2018-03-11 03:02:40 While you are partially correct, what you were seeing was not a full auto AR15. At this time bump stocks are legal and while they do increase the cyclic rate they are still not as fast as fully automatic rifles. There R ranges where you can rent and shoot full auto on premises.
1285 2018-03-11 03:01:11 You can google it. Celeb types net worth isn't that difficult to find. It's probably plus or minus some, but I'm not actually surprised. She probably has stocks or percentage of yearly earnings. She is their spokes person, pretty much the face of the NRA.
1286 2018-03-11 02:59:37 You should have read the whole article it wasn't Obama but the ATF. After Vegas Obama did try to outlaw bump stocks.
1287 2018-03-11 02:58:32 President #DonaldTrump 's announcement of #ImportTariff s, and the prospect of retaliation by other countries, is prompting some fund managers to pare their holdings of U.S. stocks and look for #opportunities #overseas.
1288 2018-03-11 02:57:55 No this is good for your friends that moved their stocks around and shouldn't effect the one % but it affects the middle classes.They will pay more on the costs of things. Any freaking raise. bye bye it goes not to mention trust countries don't trust you they were our allies!!
1289 2018-03-11 02:57:14 And I mean this in all seriousness, do you understand that most guns work as fast as you can pull the trigger for the most part? You can modify them to work faster (there are triggers that fire on pull and release, there are bump stocks, slide stocks, etc.)...
1290 2018-03-11 02:57:07 Booming economy? Stocks just fell record breaking numbers..yep..401k is our downfall thanks to you.
1291 2018-03-11 02:54:53 Umm...
Bump stocks were allowed under Obama.
Remember the big fuss Democrats made over it?

1293 2018-03-11 02:49:49 So banning bump stocks is going to turn the government into an oppressive dictatorship?
1294 2018-03-11 02:49:46 Hobby stocks = nap time
1295 2018-03-11 02:48:35 We could all figure out what stocks/businesses Falwell and his University are invested in, and boycott them?
1296 2018-03-11 02:48:14 They deserve it after scamming people.   The SEC took all the alerts they sent via email and looking into how they “front run” stocks.  Also posting fake results
1297 2018-03-11 02:47:11 According to Yahoo Finance, Biotech is a notoriously risky business. However, these are the five top biotech stocks that are poised for growth in 2018: Celgene Corporation, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Exelixis, Inc., Enzo Biochem, Inc., and AbbVie Inc! #SUACCS18

1304 2018-03-11 02:41:15 Yes and No. I think bump stocks aught to be banned, but I don't think the Executive Branch has the authority to do it. Congress makes the laws. Police enforce the laws. DoJ is the police.

1307 2018-03-11 02:39:49 Texas gets more money from the  @NRA than any other state. Bump stocks are legal, assault weapons easy to get and gun show loophole makes it easy for a felon to buy an AR-15 undetected.  26 people slaughtered in church by a guy with AR-15 and @TexasGOP did nothing. Beware of GOP
1308 2018-03-11 02:39:05 Ya but... bump stocks and arbitrary age limits. 
1309 2018-03-11 02:38:56 Did he mention draining the swamp, one indictment at a time? 

Now THAT'S real progress! 

Note to self: Time to buy some correctional service stocks...
1310 2018-03-11 02:38:44 Yeah that's great... Banning bump stocks still isn't unconstitutional.
1311 2018-03-11 02:38:09 Public traded companies are valued by their stock market capital. It's how much one have to pay to buy Apple... more like buying 100% of Apple stocks. 5 Billion Stocks at $180 per stock is $924 Billion close to $1 trillion is what you have to pay in order to buy Apple
1312 2018-03-11 02:37:47 Stocks did not seem to mind the departure for more than an hour.  Get over that Valarie is no longer calling the shots at the WH.
1313 2018-03-11 02:34:44 ..that you criticize. As I always say, problems and mistakes make you develop new skills. Mistakes make me grow and I thank you for helping me grow our community!!! The changes will take a bit of time, but changes will come! #trading #money #stocks
1314 2018-03-11 02:34:20 No, Trump's DoJ is gonna ban a device that Obama's DoJ ruled could not be banned without a change to federal law. Obama DoJ did not ban bump stocks, Trump's DoJ is gonna ban them.
1315 2018-03-11 02:33:52 The NRA isn’t concerned with bump stocks. Do some research and you will see that the NRA advocates gun laws and safety.
1316 2018-03-11 02:31:55 Machine guns and bump stocks have no place in civil society. I think students realize this very well.
1317 2018-03-11 02:31:46 I started building stocks again with some new wood, and I think my jigsaw just burnt out :/
1318 2018-03-11 02:31:17 Obama approved Bump Stocks, Firearms in National Parks & Amtrak in checked luggage. Under Trump we will get GUN CONTROL!!!
1319 2018-03-11 02:30:15 I dump those guys too...
I think a lot of people fell victim to Canada pot stocks pump.

1321 2018-03-11 02:28:25 “Oh please don’t take away our gun stocks! We need them for protection. Please don’t take them!” Brer NRA
1322 2018-03-11 02:28:22 They have had shares to short of soo many stocks that even sometimes centerpoint clients have trouble getting. But some stuff they also have of limits sometimes even for the long side. Some stocks will jst be totally unavailable..
1323 2018-03-11 02:27:52 When a person leaves and recieves a ban they should NOT be able to join back ffs @FACEIT @cookseyboi12 @stocks_william @Ellislee1212 @Jacko2321
1324 2018-03-11 02:27:14 Bump stocks wth!!!! Ban the PINCHE alualt weapon !! also
1325 2018-03-11 02:27:11 That's why it doesn't go into full effect for years.  Hope u won't need Medicare, Medicaid or social security.  Certainly hope the stocks hold up for u.
1326 2018-03-11 02:26:24 Has any shooter used bump stocks?
1327 2018-03-11 02:25:33 I cannot think of one good thing. I will however get deep satisfaction from watching stocks drop precipitously in the near future to the tune of shareholders moaning constantly about how the trade war isnt working. Feeling lucky im too poor to lose much of anything.
1328 2018-03-11 02:24:21 It’s not in the constitution to have it or not have it. btw that stocks a sloppy unsafe way to handle a weapon in which bounces off your shoulder w/o positive  control.
Meanwhile national reciprocity is growing and should be on the table
1329 2018-03-11 02:23:41 It may only be Spring Training but I am really confident in our OF stocks. #Dodgers
1330 2018-03-11 02:22:23 Finally, the government is growing some bolas to take on the NRA and the weapons manufacturers. People before profit. (Oh, btw...the 2A does not guarantee the right to own bump stocks, despite what the NRA tells you).
1331 2018-03-11 02:19:41 The left Vaginer Hat wearers kill more humans than bump stocks do. Ban their knives.
1332 2018-03-11 02:19:17 Bump stocks are useless anyways.
1333 2018-03-11 02:18:35 Imagine a world where Obama or some Dem proposed a gun regulation such as banning bump stocks

Even though Trump said he was going to do it in January. Just like you Tom he read the tea leaves and dumped his stocks. No there there
1338 2018-03-11 02:12:51 How about this reason for keeping bump stocks legal, because the Constitution requires they be legal.
1339 2018-03-11 02:12:42 Of course the Republicans r stalling in drafting a legislative prohibition banning bump stocks. U think Ryan, McConnell, et al want the NRA money faucet to dry up in 2018, a midterm election year. As long as there’s no legislation it’ll be legal to continue selling bump stocks!
1340 2018-03-11 02:12:09 why dont u add ur stocks arcotech and lasa and many more
1341 2018-03-11 02:11:41 Not the first time @INCIndia looted. Last time around in 2000 or so too situation was so bad that some of these banking stocks were trading below par values... Andhra Bank at 8 Syndicate 9. Was set right by NDA1... partly helped by fall in Govt sec yields... Congress only loots!
1342 2018-03-11 02:10:51 I’m not rich. I own stocks.
1343 2018-03-11 02:10:14 Get a grip, no one is wanting to take away your guns. Guns laws need to change. Universal background checks,  outlaw bump stocks, 48 hour waiting period. Stopping sales of assult weapons from now on.  Mental health issues need to be addressed.  I am a gun owner and not worried
1344 2018-03-11 02:09:56 Dahil sa financial conference na inattendan ko ngayon, mas napush akong aralin at mag-invest sa stocks. 
1345 2018-03-11 02:09:24 Actually, Obama would be happy if Sessions and Trump banned bump stocks. Legalization of bump stocks was the worst thing to come out of Obama’s presidency.
1346 2018-03-11 02:07:53 The left was wrong about Trump winning the election, highest GDP, hightest stocks, lowest unemployment for all American including African American, amazing taxes that help every single hard working American, lowest immigration illegal crossing.
1347 2018-03-11 02:07:35 My stocks are through the roof,  new jobs at record high,  NK threat is being dealt with...your right,  what a terrible job.  Your a moron #fakenewscnn
1348 2018-03-11 02:06:52 No law is likely to get rid of bump stocks, any more than Prohibition got rid of alcohol. Illegal drugs are epidemic even with laws against them. Our problem is unlikely to be solved by regulating the tools. It must be solved in the minds of people. Killing doesn't solve problems
1349 2018-03-11 02:06:52 Gov agencies can't save people from themselves.  Many idiots trading bitcoin now got #rekt trading stocks, options, futures, commodities, currency pairs.  They probably got #rekt buying into housing bubble in 2006 and over leveraging.  Regulations can't save stupid people.

1361 2018-03-11 01:57:22 This is why I don’t trade the stocks that @danshep55 does...

1362 2018-03-11 01:56:54 But that does not provide an excuse for deliberately moving grains from India to Europe for war stocks and letting the natives die of famine. May be he is a hero to Britain but for the colonies he is not much different from Hitler.
1363 2018-03-11 01:56:07 What sort of paper quality were you looking for? I’m really partial to their cardstock bc it’s one of their heavier stocks!

1365 2018-03-11 01:55:17 Hey @GOP this new generation is not going to let you slide with these fake “solutions.” Arm teachers, regulate bump stocks. Uh noe. #VoteThemOut
1366 2018-03-11 01:55:03 bump stocks are a misnomer. One can accomplish the same effect with nothing more than his thumb. But bump stocks are reckless and should be banned.
1367 2018-03-11 01:54:45 real estate, bonds, stocks all in huge bubbles. hes right

1369 2018-03-11 01:54:17 Dianne Feinstein initiated senate bill, S. 1916,right after the Vegas massacre. It never made it to the floor. It bans bump stocks.
1370 2018-03-11 01:53:51 That's nonsense. Stocks are sold on individual exchanges under a single jurisdiction, Bitcoin will be sold across multiple exchanges with differing rules.
1371 2018-03-11 01:53:46 Your legislation has more to it than bump stocks.  Your lies and deceit sickens me.

1374 2018-03-11 01:51:53 I own an AR-15 and it's that kind of talk that's not moving the conversation forward. I agree with banning bump stocks and a 10 day wait period.
1375 2018-03-11 01:48:31 Well, glad I sold my bump stocks towards the end of last year. Yes, I am setting up my alibi because it's true. I even have a craigslist post that I have since deleted after selling my bump stocks when it was legal to do so... 
1376 2018-03-11 01:47:03 The issue is that we have make the case that semi-automatics are different than "machine guns" but bump-stocks blurs this distinction.  This is why this isn't such a bad thing but I'd like to see a lawsuit to compensate the owners of bump-stocks.  Who have done nothing wrong.
1377 2018-03-11 01:46:54 i downloaded this investment app and forgot about it & this whole time it was rounding up my purchases and buying stocks. i made $55 
1378 2018-03-11 01:45:11 Hahahaha. Can’t stop other teams from taking him. All scouts is watching. His stocks is rising. I just hope knicks keep losing games so we can maybe get to the 7th spot.
1379 2018-03-11 01:44:48 Bump stocks in our communities are a negation of our democracy. Only a government that want to militarize its society may approve the sale of bump stocks and assault weapons. Or to create enough massacres to get an excuse to declare a police state.
1380 2018-03-11 01:44:09 Trump is a great president but he is not so great with the second amendment. Where is state carry reciprocity? Bump stocks are stupid and age 21 only works if we consider them children - no vote no military no alcohol and so on.
1381 2018-03-11 01:42:24 A while back I created a list in @stockchartscom that I call “FAANGST” = $FB $AAPL $AMZN $NFLX $GOOG $SNAP $TSLA.  As far as I’m concerned, Tesla belongs in the list of vapid, trendy stocks that are #HODL’ing this crazy market up... #FOMO #BTFD
1382 2018-03-11 01:40:37 #DOJ thankfully the authoritarians took action to make everyone safe and reclassified bump-fire stocks as machine guns. Now push for sticks and belt loops! Just a few more laws.... Almost perfect.
1383 2018-03-11 01:38:46 Watching Queer eye, and she said her husband looks terrible. Y'all have six children, he works from 9-5 and then stocks shelves at a hardware store at night. You're lucky the man can see straight.
1384 2018-03-11 01:38:41 my stomach is already in knots at this game
1385 2018-03-11 01:37:09 Bump Stocks, and what else (other Rate Increasing Devices)?
1386 2018-03-11 01:35:30 #stocks be safe
1387 2018-03-11 01:34:22 all these stars & you guys are worried about bump stocks and men kissing men
1388 2018-03-11 01:34:17 I could care less about bump stocks. Banning them is another useless solution since they can easily be made at home.
Speaking of Vegas, your age raise wouldn't have stopped that. So good example of how raising the age isn't the solution.
1389 2018-03-11 01:31:31 But security was still there right? And the only ban people want is a ban on bump stocks
1390 2018-03-11 01:30:37 Unlike you I can admit that Obama helped bring back the economy from bush's mess. Trump also helped it to go even further and you don't like that, even though economists agree.
We were told if Trump was elected stocks would crash, they didn't so he must have did something right.
1391 2018-03-11 01:30:15 I demand to speak to whomever stocks your bodega lobby.
1392 2018-03-11 01:29:32 Bump stocks are a Con-servative head fake. Typical close quarters shooters do just fine w/ semi-auto fire. No money for gun cos in cheap bump stocks made by small cos. All owners of assault rifles need to be drafted into state National Guards w/ thorough FBI interviews etc.
1393 2018-03-11 01:28:38 @tonyhwang reached out to say he will be supporting a ban of bump stocks along with a prohibition on sale of ghost guns. Thank you! #MomsDemandAction #momsdemandactionct
1394 2018-03-11 01:27:35 You know what I love? The hypocrisy.  Sessions issued a press release today that Bump Stocks will be banned.  Meanwhile, his personal attorney represents the @NRA and filed the suit against FL this week.  Politicians bought by the NRA.  They’re going down
1395 2018-03-11 01:27:32 Lol It’s called acting for Tv . Since you made so much in Realestate and stocks bruh how about you play in my game and try to take my money. Nothing big. Just bring 50k and take me apart . Bitch
1396 2018-03-11 01:27:09 Bump stocks have been used once in a mass shooting, and #Trump is working to outlaw them.  BTW, neither the #NRA nor any #2a supporter cares about making bump stocks illegal since they do illegally make a SEMI auto fire like an automatic.  Obama is the one who allowed them, too.
1397 2018-03-11 01:26:40 haahahhahahaha inform mko kung may stocks na ha?
1398 2018-03-11 01:24:59 Well, #Canada  exemption is relief for #hindalco . #Tatasteel  would like to have EU and UK exemption. 

#Metal #Stocks  rally also depends on mkts rally

1401 2018-03-11 01:22:56 Starting to consider a bit more diversification , always held onto really two stocks at a time. Looking for some good buying opportunities this week.
1402 2018-03-11 01:21:16 LMAO ya bump stocks are all over the street killing people, your a koo koo Bird,
1403 2018-03-11 01:20:43 it is not the bump stocks.... fix the people ..... mental health sucks in this country
1404 2018-03-11 01:20:41 Hope everyone is having a great weekend. Next week should be fun for 2 stocks that I'm holding over 100 million shares of. $MSPC $DCAC
1405 2018-03-11 01:20:33 Ahhh mec les ruptures de stocks sur les tables de jardins hein
1406 2018-03-11 01:19:25 Economy soaring, wages up, jobs plenty, stocks at record, unemployment record low, Isis pushed back, even No Ko willing to negotiate.  Wake up?  If this is dreaming, let's dream so more!  

What is it exactly, Tara, that you want?
1407 2018-03-11 01:19:09 What did they trade? Stocks? Baseball cards? Names?
1408 2018-03-11 01:17:56 I totally agree. I was blown away and not even finished with the course yet. What is so great about options is new traders do not need alot of money to get started. excellent for building up a stocks or crypto account. (once you learn the course)
1409 2018-03-11 01:17:22 Yet freaking Disney stocks are not flying.
1410 2018-03-11 01:16:41 Well some. But he has real estate and stocks and shit. They're basically anonymous and valuable.
1411 2018-03-11 01:15:51 Has he fought against the banning of bump stocks? Iirc it's basically the same thing?
1412 2018-03-11 01:15:43 Most parents, teachers, and students have varying opinions of gun controls and a lot of them are uninformed on the issue in the first place. I AM in support of gun control, no automatic weapons, no bump stocks, and background checks
1413 2018-03-11 01:15:20 Stupid question: he could have borrowed money to pay for the hedges and chose not to do that. 

He also chose the stocks to sell - presumably they are ones he likes the least.
1414 2018-03-11 01:14:50 Very nice shot!
What about Jeff sessions comments today concerning marijuana small small marijuana violations not being pursued?
Stocks May pop on Monday don't you think?
1415 2018-03-11 01:14:17 Lmao. CNN hasn't reported how well the economy is doing because they'd have to give Trump credit. Stocks are through the roof. But since he doesn't want to let illegals in, he's a racist? Net neutrality? Has your internet been affected since the bill passed? Nope.
1416 2018-03-11 01:14:07 I guess video games wasn't a right listed as an amendment in the constitution so you can sensor what video games they can play..  even though it hurts NO ONE..as long as people get to keep buying assault weapons..bump stocks..no permit..no training
1417 2018-03-11 01:13:04 Surely this isn’t a mystery to them after their initial statement post-Vegas on the bump stocks. It was unmistakable anger from members.
1418 2018-03-11 01:11:14 Since I was gone:

-The jaw-dropping #JobsReport was released, w/ 313k jobs added in February.
-The Nasaq finished at a record high as stocks skyrocketed.
-Denuclearization in N.K is becoming a reality.
-Trump is giving a phenomenal rally.

It’s no wonder Twitter locked me out.

1431 2018-03-11 01:03:37 Now the NRA is willing to offer bump stocks as their sacrificial lamb if it allows them to protect their assault weapon sales.

1434 2018-03-11 01:01:42 The Obama DOJ did not make bump stocks legal. It confirmed that bump stocks were not regulated under the National Firearms Act, as currently worded & outlawed similar devices that did qualify for regulation. The NRA could and would have successfully challenged a bump stock ban.
1435 2018-03-11 01:01:41 Seeing many signs of despair and ppl thinking about moving to stocks. We're close my friends, we're close. I particularly am waiting for some accelerated selling before getting in heavier again.
1436 2018-03-11 01:00:24 What do you expect people to do with their bumb stocks that they spent hundreds of dollars in? Burn them? Just because you all NOW decide it’s a felony to posses them when the law stated that they were completely legal when they where purchased!
1437 2018-03-11 00:59:51 The NRA supports more regulations on bump stocks but has not endorsed Trump's proposed ban. 
If it takes 6 months to get to this point, how long (if ever) before the really necessary regulations banning all public ownership of automatic weapons can be elected.

1443 2018-03-11 00:55:00 People who think the stock market moves randomly are wrong. It is moved with precision. Most likely machines moves all stocks according to its algorithms. People trade in between the predetermined ranges.
1444 2018-03-11 00:53:36 Everytime Trump makes the stock go down that's actually good for investors. It makes stocks cheaper which is when you should buy 
1445 2018-03-11 00:50:44 @cnn Pennsylvania better keep both eyes open with this Tariffs on Steel & Aluminum. If this is such a good bill why did billionaire Carl Icahn sold off his Steel Stocks. Europe & China going to play hardball with these tariffs on U.S. Pray Trump have his "Game Play" ready.
1446 2018-03-11 00:48:40 I never thought I'd say this, but THANK YOU @realDonaldTrump for standing up to the @NRA and banning bump stocks.  I sincerely hope you continue pushing this reform as the @NRA fight it in court.  #ProtectOurChildren #protectourschools
1447 2018-03-11 00:48:14 hopefully they sue for the bump stocks ban too
1448 2018-03-11 00:47:50 nah, they just boosted sales, making a game out of it. very cynical this bunch. close to crazy, as they'll probably not outlaw any guns/or bump stocks. they lie.

1450 2018-03-11 00:43:59 What a loser statement that was to make. Prior to the Las Vegas tragedy you were a full supporter of bump stocks, silencers, high capacity magazines, against background checks and had an A grade with the NRA. Update your resume.
1451 2018-03-11 00:43:22 @realDonaldTrump classifying bump stocks as machine guns is illegal. US code defines machine gun, and a bump stock does not fit that definition. You have overstepped your authority and oath to defend the constitution. Please reverse this.
1452 2018-03-11 00:42:04 Does he even realize most don't have stocks?

1467 2018-03-11 00:35:03 The 2A says "right to bear arms" and nothing about "accessories" like bump stocks that make a gun into an illegal automatic.
1468 2018-03-11 00:34:59 That is true, however come Good Friday stocks usually run out, I’m off tomorrow to get a mega 390g bag. 11 little bags used for treasure hunts £3.99 #value

1471 2018-03-11 00:33:26 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
1472 2018-03-11 00:33:00 I am considering subscribing to MPA. Can you give me more info? Or let me know if there are recorded videos with lessons on how you find the best stocks and trade them.

1474 2018-03-11 00:26:28 They come out in favor of banning bump stocks.
1475 2018-03-11 00:24:19 I actually completely agree, though I do think we should close gun show loopholes, fund better research into gun violence, and ban bump stocks and AR-15s. It’s possible to want those things without smearing other parents.
1476 2018-03-11 00:24:10 She’s not just worried about bump stocks. Read her bill. Dems want background checks expanded, gun show loophole closed, ages raised, assault weapons banned, etc. Look at @ChrisMurphyCT bill. #NeverAgain
1477 2018-03-11 00:20:18 If Congress does not support  Trumps 1.5 Trillion infrastructure upgrade  agenda then infrastructure stocks like Caterpillar (Cat) and US Steel (X), Bank of Amerca (BAC) erc..  may take dip in the market - Just FYI:
1478 2018-03-11 00:18:47 you're not giving hedge funds enough credit... they have PLENTY more ways to make money, --> arbitrage, lending, private equity, the list goes on and on.

The big boyz of hedge funds are just now firing up, and they will change crypto trading forerever, just as in stocks/bonds/
1479 2018-03-11 00:18:43 No but why are the NRA against the ban of bump stocks, why are they against a 3 day waiting period with no age on the 2A why are they mad against a bill that pushes the age to 21 after all handguns are 21
1480 2018-03-11 00:18:37 Can any of my gun owner tweeps advise the reason why “bump stocks” need to be in the hands of civilian, everyday folks like you and I on our streets? Honest question that I’m truly looking for the answer on.
1481 2018-03-11 00:17:17 Vampira peddles guns for NRA.  Public stocks up on garlic and crucifixes.  Final Solution to be held at daybreak.
1482 2018-03-11 00:15:21 Ban the guns that the bump stocks are made for. The ones that you banned before. What are you waiting for, Diane?
1483 2018-03-11 00:14:19 Good day. I'm thinking of playing the US stocks. Can you please recommend an online platform for suitable for pinoys. Salamat
1484 2018-03-11 00:14:12 Bump stocks were used in one crime in a century.
Hell, experts note they made the weapon LESS likely to hit anyone.
But target that instead of gang crimes and other quite prevalent violence.
1485 2018-03-11 00:13:39 By ATF’s own definition. Bump stocks are not machine guns or conversion devices.
1486 2018-03-11 00:13:24 You're an idiot. Bump stocks are to control the recoil. When you know about any kind of weapon them speak. Until then shut up. Better yet retire. Why doesn't Congress the Senate have term limits?
1487 2018-03-11 00:13:14 Mike did you just hear what Donald Trump said he's going to do. He's outlawing Bump Stocks. Next he'll raise the age of the purchaser to 21. Oh heavens what's happening. The NRA is losing their power over our Politicians. You can have Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Devin Nunez. No BD
1488 2018-03-11 00:12:40 I don't short stocks. But, a LEAP Put would be the method I'd use if I was so inclined.
1489 2018-03-11 00:11:13 Keep up the hard work you will get through it 
1490 2018-03-11 00:10:22 @PatrickHenry911 I'm an NRA member... Ya bump stocks not really Necessary , but that's not the point. If a law Abiding Citizen wants one it's a RIGHT. And another this u can fight a war at age 18 but won't be able to buy a gun? Very Crazy!
1491 2018-03-11 00:09:58 Temporarily probably. I expect it'll be like the rest of this regulation and be for "rate increasing" devices. It'll start as bump stocks, and who knows how quickly turned to regulate magazines and triggers
1492 2018-03-11 00:09:51 Well the guy in the Oval Office just announced he's outLawing Bump Stocks. Next he'll raise the age of the people who can buy guns. So hang on to the guns you have now! Who knows what Donald will do next.
1493 2018-03-11 00:09:44 One more! I started 5 businesses that flopped,1 that went so well it ATE MY LIFE!

1494 2018-03-11 00:09:42 Bump stocks don't kill people. People kill people!
1495 2018-03-11 00:09:37 @MeghanMcCain @TheView You are obviously a conservative. (As am I) 1. What is your opinion on “Bump Stocks”..and 2. What is Trump’s base’s option on them? (You talk about his supporters often on @TheView)
Will this effect his base? Or how will Republicans deal with this?
1496 2018-03-11 00:09:30 Heller: Immediately following the horrific tragedy in Las Vegas last October, I had the opportunity to speak w/the President about bump stock devices..the Administration's move to ban bump stocks is a positive step toward making our communities in NV & around this country safer
1497 2018-03-11 00:09:29 The US Department of Justice on Saturday moved to ban bump stocks, firearm accessories used to mimic automatic fire.

a good step taken forward, but not enough !  victims of #Florida school shooting or the deadly shooting in #LasVegas need more !
1498 2018-03-11 00:07:33 I never thought I would say this but THANK YOU @realDonaldTrump and Florida Governor for banning bump stocks!
1499 2018-03-11 00:06:36 Feinstein on Trump bump stock ban: The only way to guarantee bump stocks are banned is to pass a law. If Republicans truly wanted to get these dangerous devices off the streets, they would support our legislation.
1500 2018-03-11 00:06:10 The idea that Trump is banning bump stocks is a lie. He’s intentionally left a paper trail for the @NRA to block the ban in court. 

It’s a coordinated attempt to take air out of the push for actual gun reform and should be criticized by anyone who cares about the issue.
1501 2018-03-11 00:05:39 did i just earn £60 from babysitting???? consider my stocks REPLENISHED
1502 2018-03-11 00:03:06 @IngrahamAngle Great, We have outlawed Bump Stocks. So law abiding citizens wont be  able to buy them. I feel safer already. The first thing we learned in  the army was that full auto was only useful if you and the bad guys were  fighting in a phone booth.
1503 2018-03-11 00:02:56 NRA filed suit against state of Florida for banning the buying of guns under 21 to and a 3 day waiting  period and buying of Bump stocks!
1504 2018-03-11 00:02:03 Just spoke to raise your stocks would be having done an honor to throw out ins co's who can start working hard for by saying
1505 2018-03-11 00:01:51 You are stupid. Trump put tariffs on steel, reduced regulations so the mills can work again, coal mines open, stocks high, etc.
1506 2018-03-11 00:01:03 MACD crossover also supports a move higher. Volume on the up. Lots of ticks here.

Dow looks back on side breaking into overhead ascending channel last session. Not completely out of the woods of course but I'm expecting a lot of stocks to start moving well again this week.
1507 2018-03-11 00:00:49 Sure, let's compare the repeated mass shootings to one-off incidents?  What's next  A bus goes over a cliff and it's suddenly a WMD?

Rather than absurdity, let's do rationale things like ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks.  Tighten background checks.
1508 2018-03-11 00:00:18 Ban assault rifles bump stocks and high capacity magazines now @SenStabenow #AR15s #GunControlNow @SenGaryPeters
1509 2018-03-10 23:59:55 You say it's only a minority but West hams minority is a lot more than any other clubs minority. They fight amongst themselves and the owners are laughing stocks. Club is a complete joke and they don't deserve to be in top league
1510 2018-03-10 23:59:49 Just shut down speaker's corner in Hyde Park. It had a good run. Replace it with a small kiosk that only stocks copies of 1984.
1511 2018-03-10 23:59:16 Later. Go play with your guns.  Remember. Don’t send your children out to play. It’s people like you who get them killed. JUST THINK WHAT OUR WORLD WOULD BEVLIKE IF THERE WERE NO GUNS.  PEACEFUL, Loving, Safe.  Bump Stocks gone.  Next will be Ar’s and then maybe you’ll wake up
1512 2018-03-10 23:59:01 #Trump administration says it has taken the first step to ban rapid-fire bump stocks.
1513 2018-03-10 23:56:52 Great, We have outlawed Bump Stocks. So law abiding citizens wont be able to buy them. I feel safer already. The first thing we learned in the army was that full auto was only useful if you and the bad guys were fighting in a phone booth. You can't hit the broad side of a barn.
1514 2018-03-10 23:55:32 Trump WH's do-nothing on gun control: 
Ban bump stocks
Raise the gun-buy age
Take more money from the NRA
1515 2018-03-10 23:54:40 Raising the gun purchase age to 21
Banning assault weapons,bump stocks and high capacity magazines 
Require checks for all sales including internet, gun show and person-to-person/private sales
banning gun ownership for people with domestic violence convictions even misdemeanors

1517 2018-03-10 23:54:04 No, bump stocks don't turn semis into fully autos. Sorry. 

You need to go back to school and get an education.

1519 2018-03-10 23:53:55 Honest question.  Why the need for bump stocks??
1520 2018-03-10 23:53:06 Ano ba yan  so sad naman 5s na nga phone ko tapos available lang sabi ni papa 6 wala ng 6s plus  yaw ko na. Malas malas ko. Parang wala din pinagkaiba. Sana magkaroon ng stocks 
1521 2018-03-10 23:50:45 Candidate Trump truthfully told us about 22% unemployment, 200 Trillion unfunded liabilities, 20 Trillion Deficit matter, Wall St swamp...  and now - crazily owns this Fake economy and Mother of All Asset Bubbles (stocks, bonds, real estate)... our next Herbert Hoover
1522 2018-03-10 23:50:22 I don’t have one ASSHOLE. I said that. Shame on the NRA. DO U HAVE CHILDREN!   Bump stocks gone dumbass

1524 2018-03-10 23:47:55 Members of Congress shouldn’t be allowed to own stocks or mutual funds.  #ConflictOfInterest

Let them buy government bonds, CDs, and real estate instead.
1525 2018-03-10 23:47:14 @NRA I agree with President Trump!!! Ban BUMP STOCKS for CIVILIAN use, as there is NO LEGITIMATE USE FOR CIVILIANS!!! BTW, I've been A PROUD MEMBER OF THE NRA for nearly 60 years and VEHEMENTLY SUPPORT our 2nd amendment rights!!! NRA ALL THE WAY!!! SEMPER FI OOOHHHRAAAHHH!!!
1526 2018-03-10 23:46:22 dope, do you use stocks?
1527 2018-03-10 23:45:54 Very happy to see the 4 stocks that make up my portfolio are listed here.
1528 2018-03-10 23:59:55 You say it's only a minority but West hams minority is a lot more than any other clubs minority. They fight amongst themselves and the owners are laughing stocks. Club is a complete joke and they don't deserve to be in top league
1529 2018-03-10 23:59:49 Just shut down speaker's corner in Hyde Park. It had a good run. Replace it with a small kiosk that only stocks copies of 1984.
1530 2018-03-10 23:59:16 Later. Go play with your guns.  Remember. Don’t send your children out to play. It’s people like you who get them killed. JUST THINK WHAT OUR WORLD WOULD BEVLIKE IF THERE WERE NO GUNS.  PEACEFUL, Loving, Safe.  Bump Stocks gone.  Next will be Ar’s and then maybe you’ll wake up

1547 2018-03-10 23:45:29 Lately Andy has been trashing “old people.” Wonder how Rocky feels about that? I am into bitcoin and metals and stocks and in my 50s (“old geezer” - in Andy’s language)
1548 2018-03-10 23:45:11 I heard ramen stocks are at an all time. Just switched over.
1549 2018-03-10 23:44:45 It's simply a list of stocks that I suggest to avoid.
1550 2018-03-10 23:44:07 What is the difference in bump stocks and automatic weapons. It does not matter if it is a bump stock or an ar15 killing kids, concert goes or dr in a vet clinic killing is killing
1551 2018-03-10 23:44:01 Os he silenciado a todos. Ahora mi TL es una sucesión de anuncios "Invierta en el futuro. Compre Cedex Stocks". Y el hago replies. Le digo "nanai de la china"
1552 2018-03-10 23:43:38 ....they don't want to lose the market of 18-20 so they want to fight any common sense law. Also want bump stocks, which turns a semi into an auto which is illegal are against unaverisal background checks, 3 day waiting periods. Seems like they are for sales not #2A #NeverAgain
1553 2018-03-10 23:42:22 The NRA doesn’t oppose taxation/regulation of certain arms and attachments (back to the 1934 National Firearms Act). That includes bump stocks. 

What they oppose is firearms regulation via executive order. It’s likely unconstitutional (we’ll see in court). Congress should act.
1554 2018-03-10 23:41:20 Can you buy stocks in the value of Elon Musk, cuz he is creating the future lmao
1555 2018-03-10 23:40:07 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Build our wall, and hands off our bump stocks. Also end DACA and Chain migration as you promised. Other than that, great job so far!
1556 2018-03-10 23:38:28 Hey .@NRA 18 year olds are not adults. I say this as a mom of a 17 year old and a 19 year old, along with older kids. Ask any expert in neuroscience for full explanation. Btw, bump stocks are not useful for any legal reason.
1557 2018-03-10 23:38:17 Breathless coverage about Trump's making some noise about bump stocks. Bump stocks would have prevented 1 mass shooting @abcnews @marykbruce
1558 2018-03-10 23:38:00 Banning bum stocks and raising the age to purchase a weopon is a good start. But why not ban assault weapons for use by civilian persons???
1559 2018-03-10 23:37:51 Have seen countless US followers talk about wanting to hold longer, but if you hold stocks too long on asx..your profit erodes. Much different environments that have helped me in learning to adapt to different market conditions/phases.
1560 2018-03-10 23:36:57 @realDonaldTrump Sorry Mr. Trump, banning bump stocks won't stop the killings from Criminals And Crazies. Ur smart enough to know it. There are VERY many out there that any crazy person can get at anytime. Ask ur sons that hunt, they will tell U it won't stop Crazy people.
1561 2018-03-10 23:35:22 I believe FUD amplifies price action, but that’s my own belief. I do agree with the rest of your comment though! I don’t trade crypto, i am a long term investor in crypto. As for TA, i trade stocks and use TA extensively along with catalysts. Even then i am only right 65% of time
1562 2018-03-10 23:35:18 Narjarian book laid out the basic principles of options. I've been trading stocks for 20 years. I took a small amount and the gains with options on the same holding is astronomical.  Najarian give a seminar their guy was really good also hope that helps
1563 2018-03-10 23:33:19 This pisses me off but bumpstocks is not a hill I’m going to die on. Now legislation that makes belt loops bump stocks, well that is different. Or AR-15s or all semis or ammo limits. That’s a whole nother hill right there
1564 2018-03-10 23:31:37 Worst jobs record since 2010 and you call it an accomplishment. I am happy stocks up 25 percent but when they went up 148 percent under Obama y'all said it was nothing.
1565 2018-03-10 23:30:43 @SenFeinstein Funny, on the island of Maui, there's a bunch of guys who have "bump stocks" (aka slide stocks) yet no mass shootings on Maui! If it's "dangerous" I'd think there'd be lots of dead people on Maui! Hey, cars are dangerous too!
1566 2018-03-10 23:30:24 why are we letting 5 million NRA members hold the rest of the country hostage....get rid of PAC money.....get rid of bump stocks and get rid of assault rifles...#NeverAgain and yes I am a gun owner including some AR 15's.

1568 2018-03-10 23:28:48 Buzzwords .. It’s all they know. Assault weapon, 300 round magazine clips with bump stocks.

And yet a bunch of people legally permitted to vote will nod their heads listening to this crap.
1569 2018-03-10 23:26:55 Hot damn! No one is happy. It's called compromise people.

One side wants age limit raised, waiting period for purchases, bump stocks banned, school security and mental health addressed. Bingo. Got it!

One side wants the possibility for armed teachers. Bingo. Got it!

Compromise
1570 2018-03-10 23:26:21 I love how Joyce tells me she goes on my IG and stocks my pictures she’s the cutest.
1571 2018-03-10 23:24:11 @ctvottawa Bump stocks are banned in Florida now but the ban has not yet been put in place by US government. It's coming likely.....Be accurate in your reporting please.
1572 2018-03-10 23:22:26 If you own stocks of netfix sell now. Not because of this, because of the no doubt boycott this will cause. Such a dumb business move..... Stay out of this stuff......
1573 2018-03-10 23:20:51 Well then put restrictions on fire arms. Make it harder for criminals to get 30 rnd mags, bump stocks etc. To just say “criminals will do crime anyway” is ridiculous. If that’s your thinking you should be fighting for no laws. Cause that will make people safe.
1574 2018-03-10 23:19:25 How do you normally  handle stocks like NTNX? I sold most of them.
1575 2018-03-10 23:19:22 makes it official the current clown company had to wait until (more) children got killed, seriously wounded physically and mentally before they take cheap plastic half assed and totally junk bump stocks off the market. this is embarrassing..
1576 2018-03-10 23:19:07 they Want people to go to street drugs. They eliminate pain pills from people who need it and on top of it. They want to take away other options. Like Kratom. The private prison stocks must be down. And suboxone sales are low for big pharm. Dea also needs job security.
1577 2018-03-10 23:18:55 Justice Department files regulation to Jack Grealish 'bump stocks'
1578 2018-03-10 23:18:39 47 mods
39 stock cars
34 sport compacts
62 sportmods
50 hobby stocks
1579 2018-03-10 23:18:16 Is CMS negotiating drug prices? It's time to make drug companies not-for-profit, unable to sells stocks - which makes them beholden to shareholders, not patients (& also make their lobbyists illegal). It won't be easy, but there should be bipartisan support for such a law. Do it!
1580 2018-03-10 23:17:17 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
1581 2018-03-10 23:16:58 I completely forgot about bump stocks for AK’s. I should have got an ak sbr with a bump stock
1582 2018-03-10 23:15:44 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to improve your insomnia
1583 2018-03-10 23:15:05 Are we going to care about the 90% who depend on the paycheck or the 10% who own stocks.
1584 2018-03-10 23:15:01 But if they buy the stock back, the value of the stock will rise and more people would buy the stocks because of the higher value. Then the company's investment capital will increase. Which could result in the company expanding and more jobs.
1585 2018-03-10 23:14:59 check out this stocks girl
1586 2018-03-10 23:12:12 “oh fuck my stocks are fucking fire rn” 

when millennials grow up
1587 2018-03-10 23:11:48 You mean the excuse to ban bump stocks. Never was verified that the alleged shooter used one.
1588 2018-03-10 23:10:01 @smerconish the reason why Trump will survive is because too many of the @GOP is hypocrites when it comes to values and others only care oboist their stocks and mutual funds.  But this is not normal!  Nor are these true American values!
1589 2018-03-10 23:09:33  and his examples are?  Bump stocks, bigger/better unlimited high cap mags, etc.  Yep, the NRA is protecting a whole bunch of people - wait ---  I thought Fox/GOP hated actors, didn't think they had the right to weigh in on things
1590 2018-03-10 23:09:19 Check out INSTATRADER’S new IHub board with only seven stocks allowed to be discussed, called something like Long Term OTC stocks that are Mega Winners! Great board, by invitation, and I’m already up on the three stocks I bought, up on all 3!!!
1591 2018-03-10 23:08:56 I understand the fishing stocks of the Seychelles are in dangerous collapse having been over-fished by Basque contractors.

Sound familiar?
1592 2018-03-10 23:08:54 That would be the legislation you DIDN’T introduce for 8 long, horrible years even though bump stocks existed then, would it??  And look who’s solving the problem. President Donald Trump. And you clowns can’t stand it, can you?
1593 2018-03-10 23:08:12 Pls yell out 'Hands off our bump stocks, commie!' during his speech. I'd appreciate it.
1594 2018-03-10 23:08:02 You’d better call ahead to make sure that the prison commissary stocks your hair grease.
1595 2018-03-10 23:07:04 Stocks to consider into next week: 
 
$AKER $NETE $ZSAN $TEUM $CRIS $LTBR $APHB
1596 2018-03-10 23:06:41 How stupid is Trumps Twitter diplomacy?
The World used to have Adults in charge who made considered decisions.
Now Trump just tweets his whims.
Stocks plummet.
Peoples savings are lost.
Allies are left confused.
Messy.
As Putin wants. #insiders
1597 2018-03-10 23:06:37 Well, I started to read about this like 5 days ago!!! Was curious about the catalyst and now, this new development? I would say that $ACB will be green until finalization? On watch for sure for a quick/swing trade? Cheers! So manny stocks to track!!!
1598 2018-03-10 23:06:12 Who makes bump stocks?  Can't we stop that aspect?  Can we control the amount of ammunition allowed to be sold to one person?
1599 2018-03-10 23:03:56 Yeah and stocks going up actoss the board from tax policy Trump put in place. Damn that fact. It must hurt your feelings. If you're an sjw then facts don't matter anyways.
1600 2018-03-10 23:03:52 Who’s policy is it to ban bump stocks?
1601 2018-03-10 23:02:44 Investments in stocks
1602 2018-03-10 23:00:59 Put them in a moderately aggressive portfolio, 52% stocks and bonds, 33% fixed income, and 12% cash reserves
1603 2018-03-10 23:00:28 We named our firm Thunderstorm Capital because a thunderstorm is a frightening but temporary event... In constructing our portfolios, we try to invest in good companies whose stocks are depressed by frightening but temporary bad news. -- John Dorfman
1604 2018-03-10 23:00:17 #BREAKING Blockchain bought by yaoho (!)the exclamation point is cause its in there logo does anyone knowwhat lettres there are on the stocks
1605 2018-03-10 22:59:14 Slick. Be sure to talk about stocks and bonds. That will impress people too.
1606 2018-03-10 22:57:33 All NRA Members need to do a complete analysis of NRA Leadership before they screw us all.  The fundamental problem with mass killings is not AR15, not high capacity magazines, and not bump stocks, TELL THE NRA LEADERSHIP TO GET OFF THEIR ASSES.
1607 2018-03-10 22:57:32 Hi Steve it was during a Feb.26 interview with Becky Quick that he mentioned how he would choose equities over bonds "in a minute" and that he's been a net buyer of stocks in this bull market.He did a series of interviews that week on CNBC.
1608 2018-03-10 22:55:46 I just think that giving up bump stocks for Dems won't do anything. it'll never be enough. they'll always want more, and ppl will continue to say, "we need to compromise." I support you and I know you're heart's in the right place, but Dems want us to be unarmed.
1609 2018-03-10 22:55:27 It comes as no surprise that a play like $LG.V was most touted by guys like Canada Pot Stocks and realtheprophet - clearly these guys have no idea what they are doing.
1610 2018-03-10 22:55:20 Ban bump stocks. No reasonable gun owner needs one. I guess we’ll have to ban belt loops too though
1611 2018-03-10 22:54:59 Happy to see bump stocks banned as well. This should be nationwide!
1612 2018-03-10 22:54:55 Skin takes less than 5 minutes to do. We wet adopt everything whilst lambing is happening. If lamb dies later we skin to save the ewe having to go into a adopter/stocks for days. Better and less stressful for ewe and lamb 
1613 2018-03-10 22:52:04 Totally agree!! Don’t forget QCOM and CRMC (commerce one). You ride the momo until it’s not there anymore. I still remember when stocks like aol and dell and eBay would double every year and do a 2-1 split every year. You rarely see stock splits anymore.
1614 2018-03-10 22:50:28 Because I am solely responsible for the depletion of Salmon fish stocks and also it’s expensive.
1615 2018-03-10 22:48:44 When your in laws come over and stocks up ur whole fridge with nothing but filipino dessert 
1616 2018-03-10 22:48:01 Ok MRS IDIOT FEINSTEIN. We also needed to pass Obamacare into law to see what's in it!
I'm conservative. Ban bump stocks. We agreed. Now it's time to pass a voter Id laws in California. I compromised,,, will you?
1617 2018-03-10 22:47:39 Not surprising, out of control American Military Industrial Complex, needs to ramp up and start some more wars so they can dump excess bomb stocks on more innocent people, so they can get an even bigger budget next year to make even more bombs! Goto keep feeding the monster!
1618 2018-03-10 22:46:20 Yes would love go cut for you again, The carcass this week yielded chops of just shy of a kilo each!  She was a corker or a pig, well received @BreconFarmersM almost a complete sell out! we're going again with fresh stocks to @Marina_Mkt in the morning! #FatPigRules
1619 2018-03-10 22:43:17 Isn’t it more complicated? We slap #Tarriffs on euro cars? Most of those companies are owned or substantially invested by #USA auto giants #Ford #GM...so less euro car sales and #USA workers are laid off...#auto industry stocks drop. I’m no stable genius but...#steel #Tarriffs
1620 2018-03-10 22:42:42 I haven't got the article but clearly remember it being international news back in the first gulf war, America admitted it  had chemical weapons stocks and what a wonderful thing it was. The article will sill be out there.
1621 2018-03-10 22:40:02 Everyone has been collateral damage. The rest of the world where guns end up is collateral damage. The people counting their money, while looking at their stocks rise, sitting in their several thousand square foot homes, don’t care... Time to get people leading who do care...
1622 2018-03-10 22:39:27 Take deep breaths in between games and stocks. You're fucking amazing dude, you've got this. Losers bracket run EASY
1623 2018-03-10 22:39:13 Omarosa went from the White House to Big Brother, . When  white supremacy finishes using Black's or minorities they become laughing stocks of the world. Anything she says against those in power will be swept under the rug.
1624 2018-03-10 22:39:11 I imagine that there’s about to be a stark depletion in fish stocks  ;)
1625 2018-03-10 22:39:06 Lol, Cryptos sometimes reminds me of OTC stocks > Volatility
1626 2018-03-10 22:38:57 Got 5th in singles and 5th in doubles with Muk. I reaaaaaly need to fix my disadvantage because I kinda gave stocks away as if it was a yard sale.  @MeruSensei guide me.
1627 2018-03-10 22:38:51 Are firms buying back stocks at record valuations the ultimate dumb money?
1628 2018-03-10 22:38:39 Yep. Investors should keep high dividend stocks in tax deferred accounts to eliminate the tax drag.
1629 2018-03-10 22:37:27 This is a start, next step banning the weapons bump stocks were created for #neveragain
1630 2018-03-10 22:37:22 Would a ban on bump stocks change the outcome in Yountville CA?  WAKE UP!  It’s not the guns!  Its Mental Illness.  Every shooter was mentally ill.  Stop wasting our tax money on gun laws.  They don’t solve anything.  We need funding to treat mental illnesses!
1631 2018-03-10 22:36:31 Invested in 4 different stocks for my company yesterday, now I’m just waiting on my dad to get his real estate license. I really plan on putting my foot on everything.
1632 2018-03-10 22:34:46 The Justice Department formally submitted regulations on Saturday to ban 'bump stocks.'
1633 2018-03-10 22:34:14 yeah, three stocks, up to three characters, you can't swap mid fight, only between stocks where you have a 2 second window to choose between your remaining characters
1634 2018-03-10 22:32:21 That's not true though. Plenty of stocks with overfishing are sold on willing markets. It's like the headlines that NS cod is now "back on the menu". It always was! Still, even if there was a serious market danger, all the more reason to design UK-EU governance to avoid that risk
1635 2018-03-10 22:30:49 I feel like it would just be x amount of stocks. And you can choose to be your one main 2x or pick 2 characters or something.
1636 2018-03-10 22:30:37 I believe the technical definition is a stock that trades under five dollars. But, I am really talking about stocks trading under a dollar.
1637 2018-03-10 22:30:01 There is only one side of the market and it is not the bull side or the bear side, but the right side. #forex #stocks
1638 2018-03-10 22:29:15 Banning bump stocks does nothing...  Also if you think the shooter in Vegas used bump stocks, you've never heard a bump stock weapon fire before
1639 2018-03-10 22:28:54 I keep going from one extreme task to another. Now Im trying to figure out what stocks to invest in. 
1640 2018-03-10 22:28:37 Gotta couple stocks, gotta few bonds tryna accumulate tHings gain value and dont depreciate over time ... guns and butter; I want tHe burners
1641 2018-03-10 22:28:14 No he only does Aussie stocks, he finds all the dirty ones to avoid.. He will research the odd TSX for me
1642 2018-03-10 22:25:34 ...has taken a big bite out of people's buying power—as you know all too well. It hasn't helped anybody who doesn't own related stocks.
1643 2018-03-10 22:24:24 Have people lost their damned minds? Nobody wants to take their guns. Just implement common sense legislation to ban AR-15's- for civilian use and bump stocks
1644 2018-03-10 22:23:10 Just watch. This will
- not stop violent crime
- increase sales of bump fire stocks
- increase @NRA membership
- create havoc when they confiscate them
- lead us to rethink 2nd amendment & embolden  #MolonLabe crowd to defend against tyrannical government
1645 2018-03-10 22:21:58 I'd take you seriously if you could make any valid points. Fish stocks in the area of the Valdez spill are not back to normal, not even remotely close. In fact, nearly every study in the area has shown the opposite. Stocks continue to plumit as sell as show signs of deformations
1646 2018-03-10 22:21:42 What about @nra pushing for the BAN of bump stocks? Gonna just sweep that one under the rug? #2A #shallNOTbeinfriged
1647 2018-03-10 22:20:00 For goodness sakes Mozeliak if Lynn signs for less than qualifying offer go sign Arrietta or Cobb. Never will they be cheaper. Like buying stocks in 2009. Never before seen discount opportunity.
1648 2018-03-10 22:19:45 Just seen them last week at a lil hole in wall store 
Chain stores not stocked here locally yet, but I have mom & pops store getting them for me, dang they great! My whole family hooked-n grandkids-
Freaky awesomeness hope Walmart or Kroger or somewhere large stocks soon
1649 2018-03-10 22:18:10 I wonder how much $ #UBC and #SFU have invested in Kinder Morgan stocks?
1650 2018-03-10 22:17:33 Its Shatterday here at the Metta Lounge! You know what that means, get a whopping 25% off your favourite concentrates while stocks last!
1651 2018-03-10 22:16:40 Keep grasping Nicolle, with each unhinged reach, you are more and more irrelevant, like your friend Joe and Mika. Laughing Stocks
1652 2018-03-10 22:15:53 Was it not the Establishment, the established “wisdom” of the NY-DC Corridor who time after time predicted Trump couldn’t win a Primary, couldn’t win the R ticket, could NEVER beat Hillary, would never get the delegates, would have the economy & stocks collapse @paulkrugman ?!?
1653 2018-03-10 22:15:31 Bump stocks make the gun less dangerous, a gun shooting automatically is less accurate than a gun shooting semi automatic.
1654 2018-03-10 22:14:20 @news965wdbo great show this am on portfolio management. I was able to get thru and ask some Qs on stocks and bonds! 
1655 2018-03-10 22:13:53 Relative shares is the biggest cause of discards in the CFP rule book. It also causes discards through the scientific assessment process as it is also tied too reletive key so the data picture on some stocks is out of line with distribution of stock activity
1656 2018-03-10 22:13:49 You can make homemade bump stocks you do realize that right? It’s nothing more then the recoil of the weapon being manipulated to fire it again and again right.
1657 2018-03-10 22:13:42 I will fight in Congress for:
1. #AssaultWeaponsBan, high capacity magazines ban
2. Bump stocks ban
3. Universal background checks
4. Waiting periods
5. Stricter gun prohibition for those with mental illness or on no fly list
6. Enforceable relinquishment laws
1658 2018-03-10 22:13:08 Not with bump stocks. That's why 50+ people died in Vegas and 500 were injured
1659 2018-03-10 22:13:04 TERRA PRIME GROUP stocks rallying
1660 2018-03-10 22:12:51 Tesco didn’t have them this week—maybe didn’t get stocks back in after the snow. Coop has a space marked on shelf but has been empty a while. This is v small in the larger scheme of things.
1661 2018-03-10 22:12:46 Last couple of weeks there has been lots of calls for people to donate blood as stocks are low due to cold weather incidents & illnesses. How dare they sell it off. Last time we bought blood so many got infected with Hep C etc  #ToriesOut
1662 2018-03-10 22:12:30 So they are banning owning bump stocks? Is the government paying for them to be turned in? If not, this is highly unconstitutional. Imagine If it was something you paid hundreds of dollars for only to be forced under threat of violence to turn them in without compensation @NRA
1663 2018-03-10 22:12:23 Hey value stocks pro thanks for the follow!
1664 2018-03-10 22:11:59 I am a stock trader who makes decent bank trading stocks on a swing trading strategy.
1665 2018-03-10 22:11:49 If they let it. There's a lot of resistance right now. Maybe if it doesn't trend for a little while it will continue to inch back up a bit at a time. I hate seeing one of my stocks trend because the day traders and shorters come out en masse to beat it down.
1666 2018-03-10 22:11:48 Bump stocks are kind of stupid but did you know you can do the same thing by putting your thumb through your belt loop and positioning your gun just right.
It will bump fire.
1667 2018-03-10 22:11:26 Hey value stocks pro thanks for the follow!
1668 2018-03-10 22:10:31 Bump stocks still don't prevent the sale of weapons for mass murder, and this was brought about by the students of PARKLAND, BECAUSE OF THEIR MOVEMENT!! NOT DIRTY DON!!!
1669 2018-03-10 22:10:11 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1670 2018-03-10 22:10:07 They do not grow it is strictly for inventory of ready to sell weed once they get their license i believe it can hold millions of dollars of inventory cant find the source i believe it was mentioned in the agoracom video or namaste 420 video anyone remember?
1671 2018-03-10 22:09:44 @ Stocks o'clock... I miss the old you
1672 2018-03-10 22:09:26 When the NRA goes to court to get teens AR15's with bump stocks and larger magazines.
1673 2018-03-10 22:08:58 Of course, yes! 

It's a sad comment on our times that 36% oppose. To give them the benefit of a doubt, maybe at least some of those who 'oppose' think the charge should be more significant, or that she should go right to the public stocks.
1674 2018-03-10 22:08:49 2/ If, with your stocks, the taxman deems you an investor, you will be taxed as a crypto investor. If you buy one cryptocurrency and convert it to another, that is considered barter, and that is considered a taxable event. Have fun with your avoidance 
1675 2018-03-10 22:08:39 Don't need to. Based on the quality (or lack thereof) of your posts on biotech stocks, lack of followers despite 4000+ posts, tells me the story.
1676 2018-03-10 22:08:24 Definitely exist in tins, probably dried, too. We eat them at least weekly. Not entirely sure Coop stocks them, but Morrison’s and Tesco definitely. They are usually with the beans.
1677 2018-03-10 22:08:11 Many Thanks John... I was off Twitter for a week Catching up now. Hey Did you catch IBD Weekly on the Cover with Will Danoff? I started managing Stocks 2 years before he came in with the ContraFund in 1990... Man, seems like yesterday... only difference is GREY HAIR 
1678 2018-03-10 22:04:47 that's a Big THUMBS DOWN ... we do NOT NEEDE another ESTABLISHMENT #Globalist ...@potus needs someone who can actually help #MAGA for the #MiddleClass for a CHANGE ... the stocks are up 2,500% but wages WORTH LESS than 1970  ...ENOUGH IS ENOUGH .. Just say NO to #GOPe
1679 2018-03-10 22:04:44 Yes but 4.4bn in hedge losses were financed ~50/50 via stocks & bonds. Meanwhile recent Stk investment has underwhelmed & hold bns in cash. But shareholders are expected to look at only this legacy list which with 20/20 hindsight would have rained money
1680 2018-03-10 22:04:35 My stocks are always hiii Holmes 
1681 2018-03-10 22:04:22 What are the talking points against your legislation?  I am strongly against bump stocks among other things.
1682 2018-03-10 22:03:37 If this bill becomes law, will current owners have their bump stocks confiscated?
1683 2018-03-10 22:02:45 1/ lol, yeah, I would like to see you try not recording your activity to avoid the taxman. Any transaction you do with crypto is taxable, the only time you avoid tax is when buying goods and services with bitcoin. If, you've been trading stocks = you're a trader.
1684 2018-03-10 22:02:30 S/o to Smith's Marketplace @kroger for being the only place that stocks Shiner beer. I wish they had seasonal brews though. I'd kill to try some Shiner Cheer.
1685 2018-03-10 22:01:30 Justice Department moves to ban bump stocks at Trump’s behest - National -
1686 2018-03-10 22:00:51 nobody is interested in steel workers, one buys carbon fiber stocks. That's the big lie.
1687 2018-03-10 21:58:55 Still with the bump stocks even tho it was an m134 mini gun in vegas!
1688 2018-03-10 21:58:16 Multan and Islamabad, two exact opposites. Multan has seen quite a downfall even though they're such a strong side while on the other hand Islamabad has seen quite a rise even though their side and international stocks aren't quite high as they could be.

1690 2018-03-10 21:57:39 I’ve seen video on bump stocks easily made by anybody-no good will come of this.
1691 2018-03-10 21:56:32 A particular youtuber I follow, who does ta actually said that because of the volatility and unpredictability of crypto, the charts are better suited to stocks. The macd, fib & elliot waves are good indicators & unless you are right on it you'll miss the position.
1692 2018-03-10 21:55:23 One of the dot-com boom's biggest investors sees trouble ahead for tech stocks due to valuations.
1693 2018-03-10 21:55:05 You talk a lot about moral obligations... whose morals? Floodingg the economy with money to boost stocks that hurt savings was not not moral... it was robbery
1694 2018-03-10 21:55:03 You said, "Fish are a common resource for all."
They aren't.
Some stocks migrate and range widely, but those which do not can hardly belong to anyone other than the nation which owns the waters in which they occur.
I don't own the plants in your garden, do I?
1695 2018-03-10 21:54:06 Now the stocks too expensive! I bought in too late. Fuck me. You can’t tell me the cubs can’t send over some saber metrics nerds to Halas Hall
1696 2018-03-10 21:53:02 @realDonaldTrump instead of banning bump stocks you should ban idiot governor's and mayor's that protect illegal criminal immigrant's, how are they protecting the citizen's of their state's or city's?  I say put them all in jail with all the illegal criminal immigrants.
1697 2018-03-10 21:52:22 Comprehensive background check (including mental health screening), at least a 3 day waiting period, compulsory firearm safety training from a certified professional or law enforcement personnel, ban bump stocks.  At the very least.
1698 2018-03-10 21:51:45 #Brexit #economy stupid - whenever the CAPE ratio of the market is high, it means stocks are  overvalued, and returns over the next 20 years will likely be poor.
1699 2018-03-10 21:50:44 That's not actually true however, the NRA publicly announced that they supported banning bump stocks, it actually costed them some member. Now they don't support this bill because that's not the only thing in this bill
1700 2018-03-10 21:50:03 The more I look at it, the less gas concerns me. Last yr, to use a supply/demand analog, high was on 02/10 (~259k/kbbl's)  Consumed ~50k/kbbl's to yr low. This yr later to build high, assume 03/23 (~251k/kbbl's). If same demand (50k/kbbl's), stocks drop to lowest since 2012!
1701 2018-03-10 21:49:30 Ca m'a fait très plaisir mon chou !  J'en ai d'autres en stocks pour quand j'aurai de nouveau besoin de muscler ma nuque en petit comité !
1702 2018-03-10 21:48:17 It’s amazing how many people call the bond market a bubble. Without realizing that a bear market in bonds, with Stocks at all time high valuations, makes them an even bigger risk, from a percentage-loss standpoint.
1703 2018-03-10 21:46:31 #Yountville has proved to me that everyone needs to do something about the mental health and gun issues in our country.
I’m going to divest myself of any financial holding I have in stocks and 401ks that are connected to gun manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.
1704 2018-03-10 21:45:57 Bump-stocks are already in the process of being banned
1705 2018-03-10 21:45:24 What surprises me the most about the “what I want the most from the new smash” discussion is that I haven’t heard a single person ask for stocks to be the default in vs mode instead of time lol
1706 2018-03-10 21:44:38 We're getting sued for banning bump stocks and raising the min age to 21 to purchase all guns with one exemption. Anyone on active, reserve or national guard duty under 21 can still purchase. I was surprised they didn't go after the 3day cool down period. Imagine that?
1707 2018-03-10 21:43:55 We vote you just buy more ranch because you can't drizzle stocks on your pizza. 
1708 2018-03-10 21:42:44 Thank you for the explanation.  Just frustrating when stocks are low and I can't help. Does make sense though.
1709 2018-03-10 21:42:33 They think banning bump stocks will appease the masses. They'll just got after something else next.
1710 2018-03-10 21:40:41 @horseracingmama @ridinghat1   Cheltenham will be a changed town this coming week, all locals keep out.  Garage with most EXPENSIVE cars always sells all stocks talking about £100,000's
1711 2018-03-10 21:37:59 Fake news
1712 2018-03-10 21:37:41 Thanks I just bought seven more bump stocks.
1713 2018-03-10 21:36:01 @morran_alex where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
1714 2018-03-10 21:35:47 @chengevelyn and @CNBC are both jokes, if they weren't they would be writing stories on why @IHub_StockPosts is still utilizing paid bashers to manipulate stocks. #FakeNews #boycottihub #claymustpay #cellforshell
1715 2018-03-10 21:34:49 Never had a problem with background checks.

Bump stocks are irrelevant, it's the wording in the bill that matters.

I disagree with raising the age unless we raise the age to vote and join military as well.

Again, the wording is what matters. Violent/severe insane - yes.
1716 2018-03-10 21:34:22 As for Mr. Choi, his debts are so not Korean. Get a real lawyer, like a former supreme court justice to argue your case, and give him 100 million dollars for the whole service, including getting your stocks back. That's simple. You have pussy little lying girls as helpers.
1717 2018-03-10 21:33:59 Bait and switch.  People are demanding assault rifle ban.  DOJ bans bump stocks...
1718 2018-03-10 21:33:28 Market being held up by handful of tech stocks – “FAANGs” (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google).  Size = have disproportionate effect on wider market. Many now trade at astonishingly high valuations. Amazon’s p/e/ ratio 2016 – last full year of data –  229.98...
1719 2018-03-10 21:32:36 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1720 2018-03-10 21:32:32 STILL Slightly Irritated, The GOP Are Meeting In The Middle To Raise The Age, Require Mental Health Checks, Dealing w/ Bump Stocks, BUT Still Refusing To Take Assault Rifles OFF The Shelves For The General Public. Regardless, of Mag, A Civilian Does NOT Need An Assault Weapon!!!
1721 2018-03-10 21:32:18 Wow, more on Stocks and gave a commitment to see what
1722 2018-03-10 21:30:01 The GOP is more interested in passing a bill to further decimate LGBTQ rights. Guess they see us as more dangerous than guns, bump stocks, high capacity magazines. Love or bullets? Gosh. I know sometimes love hurts, but guns kill.
1723 2018-03-10 21:29:30 Like the number of stocks v. the number of stock indexes . . .
1724 2018-03-10 21:27:56 Fundamentally and historically speaking President Trump is a big supporter of The Second Amendment. I wouldn't think he would do something like that. However banning bump stocks would not infringe on gun owners rights. I am sure his administration will just do th hat.
1725 2018-03-10 21:27:00 but how does he kill at 20% without strings that end in stocks.
1726 2018-03-10 21:26:26 Whatever. Everyone gets a gun with no Bump Stocks regardless of race, creed, gender, physical ability.
1727 2018-03-10 21:24:52 اخي سألت ولم احضى بجواب وهو:صفقات الفرص المميزة ؟ ما سبب ميزتها ؟ علما بأنه قد يظهر سهم انه من الفرص المميزة لكنه قد يمضي عليه عشرة ايام وهو في مكانه ؟ مثل صناعات كهربائية فكيف اعطيتموه هذه الميزة ( الفرص المميزة)
1728 2018-03-10 21:24:10 Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world. #Stocks #Investments
1729 2018-03-10 21:23:46 A few stocks removed from the weekly ACJ watchlist: $ANET $TTWO $STZ $TEAM $AMAT $SQ $BZUN $MB and a few added: $IPGP $SFIX
1730 2018-03-10 21:23:10 Ohhh, and by "think differently" you mean you support the #NRA , an organization that makes money when gun stocks go up after a school massacre and that supports teens buying AR15s to slaughter children. #NeverAgain #GunReformNow #NRABloodMoney #NRAKillsKids
1731 2018-03-10 21:22:05 Bump stocks were never used by Americans to kill Americans.
How about dismantling the CIA & FBI implicated in all these killings.?
1732 2018-03-10 21:21:45 Stocks to Watch: AMRC, TWTR, XOM. Read our in-depth analysis for more.
1733 2018-03-10 21:19:37 It is, this is a go to option swinger for me. Just tends to behave like I want it too more than other stocks haha
1734 2018-03-10 21:18:34 You don’t have an idea do you? Bump stocks make a reliable rifles, unreliable. FTF and FTE problems. Plus civilian rifle were not designed to shoot that many rounds that fast. An entry level AR15 cooks itself after about 800 rounds rapid fire. An AKM cooks itself after about 300.
1735 2018-03-10 21:17:39 Buy stocks in all Swindon tanning salons whilst you still can
1736 2018-03-10 21:16:37 I guess you mean bump stocks.  :yawn:  a skilled shooter can do the same with a shoe lace or their hand in their pocket although you sacrifice accuracy.  When you're shooting fish in a barrel like in LV, accuracy isn't as important.  AR is for Armalite Rifle, your point?
1737 2018-03-10 21:14:52 so is #PeytonManning going to jail like #MarthaStewart then? cuz u kno them stocks bout to drop... and he did sell his shares 2 days before NFL dropped them... curioser and curioser...
1738 2018-03-10 21:13:08 BRAVO!  Wish I had stocks so I could do the same!
1739 2018-03-10 21:12:53 That is not fair just look at Canopy Growth , they helped that company's stocks rise and they are also allowing them to keep $40M of their of investment, #TOTALSUCCESS

1741 2018-03-10 21:09:12 Just remember #boycottihub
1742 2018-03-10 21:08:42  bump stocks are a joke. Only “used” in Vegas by a gun runner for iSIS. I don’t think you know what you’re talking about!
1743 2018-03-10 21:08:16 Screaming your head off to cheer for your friends isn’t cool, it’s douchy. Keep it bewteen stocks only or you’re a fucking asshole. My headphones broke at this tournament so there was nothing I could do
1744 2018-03-10 21:06:36 When no stocks left, flow has nothing to flow
1745 2018-03-10 21:06:10 I just want to be like you when I grow up 

Yuh nuh know how me deh ya a grudge yuh when you a tweet bout making stocks and all the nice things you do with them. Wait till me really leggo inna the kitchen
1746 2018-03-10 21:04:43 Which gut punch exactly r u speaking of? The economy? Jobs? Stocks? Please enlighten us
1747 2018-03-10 21:04:33 Stocks scare me but I would invest my life savings if somebody pitched me a lotion that didn't make those little booger lumps

1750 2018-03-10 21:02:40 Could argue that indexing has fair amount to do with div yield as well given passive tends to allocate more to most expensive stocks than active.  Several of top names such as amzn, fb, google, Berkshire etc don’t pay regular dividends.
1751 2018-03-10 21:01:35 I will have to see if my local shop stocks it - I assume you recommend?
1752 2018-03-10 21:00:35 How management communicates mistakes is very important. No one is mistake-free - as investors 40% of the stocks we buy underperform the market - and I'd be concerned about any company where shareholder communication doesn't include a candid assessment of mistakes. -- Bill Nygren
1753 2018-03-10 21:00:25 did you forget to mention the justice dept has file a petition to ban bump stocks or just leave that part out in the attempt to make yourselves look good and the other side look bad?  shame on you Dianne, listen get Jesus in your life spread the gospel and live in peace.
1754 2018-03-10 20:59:55 You want bump stocks and any "rate increasing device" but you can't even define the CURRENT rate of fire......nah I'm good.
1755 2018-03-10 20:59:46 Will it be limited to bump stocks or is this going to be like the last bill
1756 2018-03-10 20:59:33 Justice Department Proposes Banning Rapid-Fire Bump Stocks GII
1757 2018-03-10 20:59:08 If they are going to ban bump stocks, why not ban automatic weapons too? Bump stocks make guns to be like automatics - cit out the middle man and ban them all!
1758 2018-03-10 20:58:07 It's era of artificial intelligence to trade stocks.
The person will continue to increase the money without having to work even one second.
1759 2018-03-10 20:57:14 The only way to guarantee bump stocks are banned is to pass a law. If Republicans truly wanted to get these dangerous devices off the streets, they would support our legislation. #BanBumpStocks
1760 2018-03-10 20:56:32 He claims to have been long stocks from 2012 like many others.  How did that cost people their retirement? He'll it's like a bear that was never a bear.  Bull market for years? Two 60% collapses since 2000 followed by outlier financial leveraging-never happened from 82 to 00.
1761 2018-03-10 20:55:29 Hey @NYSE .. Really wish you could invest in athletes as stocks. Imagine buying @TigerWoods when the highway patrol was taking selfies with him at 4am for $.04 a share. Now he’s trading at $75 before the @TheMasters #thinkaboutit
1762 2018-03-10 20:55:10 leon and I are gonna try going to the local toys r us on my bday and raid the transformers+monster high stocks before it closes

1764 2018-03-10 20:53:57 Google finance is easy way to show all of it in one shot. Stocks are in 4 diff accounts. Questrade doesn't have a graph of account balance over time. I put in a request to QT for that, haven't heard back yet.
1765 2018-03-10 20:53:46 You know your country is fucked when it's high key headed toward another huge financial crisis, but all anyone cares about are tech company stocks and the national employment rate.
1766 2018-03-10 20:52:22 Stocks don't move off of fundamental so don't worry about what a conference call says...they move off algorithms programmed to technicals which has created a #fakemarket
1767 2018-03-10 20:52:21 Needed:
No guns until 21yo
No bump stocks
Ban AR-15s, equivalent guns
Ban multi-shot clips
Ban body-shredding ammo
Universal background checks & gun registration 
“Red flag” restraining orders
No guns if on no fly list
Boycott NRA
Vote out NRA puppets
1768 2018-03-10 20:50:09 Ok well generic demands don’t help either- semiautomatic weapons are already banned-bump stocks will be banned- school children need to be safe from all dangers- why are this kids in March for life not complaining about law enforcement failure?
1769 2018-03-10 20:49:17 Just like with bump stocks  and DACA, congress will huff and puff and then do nothing
1770 2018-03-10 20:48:01 WOW....can there be a bigger waste of time....only one person used bump stocks to murder people and he had so many weapons it didnt matter what he used. This is nothing but a lame attempt to shut liberals up..and as we know, nothing shuts a liberal up..
1771 2018-03-10 20:46:02 If you think that acting the hero is going to distract the American people from serious domestic issues you are wrong. Children are DEAD. When will you sign that order banning bump stocks?
1772 2018-03-10 20:45:49 I agree. They apparently have stocks n the porn business. They lead with her updates everytime. Decided it's time to switch more frequently to Cspan
1773 2018-03-10 20:45:46 About public service.  I have novel idea.  Let's make public service really serve the public.  All Congresspersons and Senators must put all their assets in blind trusts.  No trading in stocks and bonds while in office.
1774 2018-03-10 20:43:53 Fucking hell, are they going to put the poor bastard in the stocks, and let them pelt him with rotten fruit too?
1775 2018-03-10 20:43:03 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains

1777 2018-03-10 20:40:17 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1778 2018-03-10 20:38:45 I think it takes an extra level of “skills” to be long stocks that are going down, when we’re in a bull market, and basically every stock goes up! Lol!!

Talk about “bad luck”

1779 2018-03-10 20:38:35 Proud that Gov. Scott signed this bill to raise age to purchase guns, ban bump stocks and provide school security and much more. Disappointed that the NRA is challenging this new Legislation immediately. Their heart and mind is not in the right place.
1780 2018-03-10 20:38:26 I dont like this becuase bump stocks makers are currently open to class action law suits that could put them out of business id rather seem them go bankrupt than being protected from lawsuits
1781 2018-03-10 20:37:53 I moved mine to a self directed account and bought some solid stocks

1784 2018-03-10 20:36:30 It is my belief that bump stocks are the product of legislation. Manufacturers had to put trigger guard to make a legal collapsable stock. Unfortunately someone figured out it could be misused.

Just because one chose to participate in the Stock-holm Syndrome game by financial engineering doesn't mean it is a smart thing to do.
1788 2018-03-10 20:34:10 Justice Department Files Regulation to Ban 'Bump Stocks'
1789 2018-03-10 20:33:46 Not Dem but thanx 4 playing. Big business is enjoying only, not giving to employees instead buying back all their stocks. Glad you enjoy golf and Twitter. Would rather have the POTUS be too busy to do either. He does have a nation to run, oh and sleep w/ pornstars
1790 2018-03-10 20:33:26 I’m sure they’ll both be back in false pseudonyms telling you to buy or sell stocks they both get commission for !!! F*ck em
1791 2018-03-10 20:32:01 Deep Q's for a Sat night!
My view: the moment you remove an index constituent, you become actively managed. You could cause havoc rebalancing weightings and skew the index risk profile. If you're well diversified, those few mispriced stocks aren't likely to kill overall returns.
1792 2018-03-10 20:31:13 Jesse Council will lead the field to the green flag in the street stocks.
1793 2018-03-10 20:30:43 i wonder if i should sell my twitter stocks lol
1794 2018-03-10 20:30:00 The Trump administration is proposing banning bump stocks, which allow guns to become fully automatic and were used in last year's Las Vegas massacre. #HeartNews
1795 2018-03-10 20:29:48 Vegas. Remember Vegas. Maybe 20 less people get wounded and 5 more survive if he didn’t have the arsenal he did with bump stocks.

What’s the downside to making bump stock illegal?
1796 2018-03-10 20:29:07 I run screens during market hours. I pull up the 197 Ind Groups in MS and go through those on weekends with the stocks sorted by AD$V and usually stop at $10M unless I see strong RS below that.
1797 2018-03-10 20:28:37 And the slide down the slippery slope begins.
Age increase, ban on bump stocks, then a ban on semi automatic rifles followed by ban on all semi automatic guns..when does it end?
1798 2018-03-10 20:27:51 Let’s just say that the gin stocks have been severely depleted!
1799 2018-03-10 20:27:35 #Trump ‘s Justice Department Takes Actual Steps Toward Banning Bump Stocks. #Bumpstock #gun attachments have the ability to turn semiautomatic firearms into automatic weapons.
1800 2018-03-10 20:27:32 My advice buy small penny stocks that are going to be importantly American companies ad buy there steel and aluminium stocks lol
1801 2018-03-10 20:27:17 Trumpies, Trump’s taking your bump stocks away. Next your guns. 
Oh wait, that was what Obama was supposed to do, wasn’t it?

1805 2018-03-10 20:25:18 Banning bump stocks gives Trump a little good press, makes everyone think  he's not that bad .  And pisses off the NRA. it's no skin off of his back. As long as he gets good press and good ratings no good deed goes unpunished
1806 2018-03-10 20:22:54 Amazing app. I am reading news about all my watchlist stocks and checking scans in the app. Thanks for all your efforts. Wish you a great success. :-)
1807 2018-03-10 20:22:20 Real talk though: why is banning bump stocks more unconstitutional than banning fully automatics? Or short-barreled shotguns?
1808 2018-03-10 20:22:09 They may yet lose to challenges of denial of Constitutional rights to legal citizens but it is up to the states to a certain degree. That will likely be in the courts for awhile. Bump stocks serve a purpose for disabled people. Other than that the NRA opposed them.
1809 2018-03-10 20:22:08 "The market looks expensive judged from the entire sweep of recorded market history, but nearly normal over the past quarter-century, and far from being in bubble territory.

1821 2018-03-10 20:13:17 Today bump stocks, tomorrow bullet polish!
1822 2018-03-10 20:13:05 When I see people speak about what they THINK they know about guns it makes me cringe. The NRA doesn’t support bump stocks. They don’t sell them. @DLoesch  tried telling everyone that bump stocks should be banned BUT no one would LISTEN to her. Too busy booing her and not hearing

1824 2018-03-10 20:10:37 He did the same stuff with Retrophin, short selling of stocks, illegal stock trading, using it as a front for his investment company, buying drugs and hiking up their prices and developing NO new products

1828 2018-03-10 20:06:35 @JoeNBC @jaketapper Is anyone asking the question about the elimination of bump stocks that trump promised to do? Is that happening?
1829 2018-03-10 20:05:35 I believe his comment meant “why ban bump stocks when I can just use my belt buckle instead”.

I believe that’s not a worthwhile argument, and we absolutely can ban bump stocks. (But can’t ban using your belt buckle as a make-shift bump stock)
1830 2018-03-10 20:05:28 No thats what bump stocks can do.
1831 2018-03-10 20:05:09 IMO when markets dip, these are the equities investors should be buying. Not growth stocks.
1832 2018-03-10 20:04:00 ... as if there weren't any fake secondary offers (I.e. companies a,b,c inject capital in company x, company X  buys stocks of companies a,b,c, shares are issued, mcap increases despite no new value). The only difference with the stock exchange is that you risk jail if caught.
1833 2018-03-10 20:03:53 so much pretense. overvalued stocks.  overvaluation because of people’s emotional investment.
1834 2018-03-10 20:03:25 Why is everyone getting so touchy I don’t get it, are we losing them stocks in business? What’s HULA BAGULA about?
1835 2018-03-10 20:01:39 Stocks continue to  defy gravity!  How much more can these go up in a rising rate environment?
1836 2018-03-10 20:00:59 An index investor wouldn’t take a view on the stocks. The mandate is to strictly minimize active risk.

1838 2018-03-10 20:00:28 @21savage just read your article with  ssense, dope man!And yes, fuck jewellery invest in stocks and crypto ain’t no jewellery gonna make you richer....but a nice Philip Patek, hublot or roger dubuis Watch never hurt anyone
1839 2018-03-10 19:58:53 Well you're wrong as usual...the only thing that classifies one as an assault weapon is if it has automatic repeating rates of fire with a single press of the trigger...
It's just a rifle...bump stocks are not rifles.
This RIFLE had never been used by the military.
1840 2018-03-10 19:57:03 More gun control means - background checks, limit bump stocks, raise age limit and check mental health !
1841 2018-03-10 19:55:44 A military style weapon that can shoot an insane about of bullets with their magazines. Do you know what bump stocks are and what they turn AR-15 literally into?
1842 2018-03-10 19:54:56 hey @Saccone4PA18 Trump claims you "Love 2nd A," are you for banning bump stocks & "taking the guns first" without due process, as Trump said he would do last week?
1843 2018-03-10 19:54:53 Still won't make a damn difference. Stocks are made to support your shoulders
1844 2018-03-10 19:54:51 Semi Autos, bump stocks, etc are made to shoot people, many people quickly without a lot of training and with maximum damage. They don’t belong in your “Toolbox”. As Scalia stated The second amendment does not provide unlimited ownership. Keep pimping for The NRA.
1845 2018-03-10 19:54:35 I thought they were hired to win games. When they don’t they have cause to fire. 

I’m a salary employee and could get fired for lack of performance and lose long term earnings (non-vested stocks, etc)

Why do these guys get a free pass?

1847 2018-03-10 19:54:28 AR-15 murder weapons for sure, bump stocks, high capacity magazines for all guns. There are evil people, you're not going to stop everyone but we sure can make it harder. Sitting on our hands is no longer an option.
1848 2018-03-10 19:53:23 Pretty sure we'll survive without bump stocks
1849 2018-03-10 19:53:08 Do you have book recommendations on that topic or in general when it comes to stocks and investments?
1850 2018-03-10 19:51:46 Anybody, know somebody who can teach me the first steps in investing into stocks?
1851 2018-03-10 19:50:31 Banning bump stocks is a nice symbolic gesture. But Americans will still be able to buy completely unnecessary semi-automatic rifles with little to no oversight. They’ll just have to move their finger a little more when they want to shoot something.
1852 2018-03-10 19:49:53 1. The 2A is not a beverage or a smoke. 2. It’s not the gun, it’s the one who pulls the trigger. 3. Classify Bump Stocks as an NFA accessory.
1853 2018-03-10 19:49:22 Overfishing is a result of a quota system forcing fishermen to catch twice the TAC necessary to find what they can keep.That stocks are increasing despite this suggests UK fleet & our tech measures are well in line with environment. Decent UK policy will increase sustainability.
1854 2018-03-10 19:48:40 Bump stocks are not firearms. No court is going to rule in favor of giving a killing machine to civilians.
1855 2018-03-10 19:48:37 If a guy cannot entertain me with intellectually stimulating conversation, I don’t even want it. I’m allergic. Like, I know you’re not asking me “wyd” again.  Insight me with facts, knowledge, make me aware of something. Books, stocks, anything. But WYD spells B-Y-E.
1856 2018-03-10 19:47:34 Fits with your HF colleague who predicts the FAANG stocks will cease to "lift" the Nasdaq, very shortly....
1857 2018-03-10 19:47:34 Well looks like it’s time to start picking up bump stocks.
1858 2018-03-10 19:46:56 Bump stocks does not make a semi auto rifle into automatic rifle  not even close. These people are so uneducated
1859 2018-03-10 19:46:45 Mom’s dad was a teamster and Mom made artificial flowers. Dad’s father- tried to farm (didn’t work out), work in a furniture factory (had to get out health)and saloon/speakeasy made loads of money- retired when liquor was legal owned houses and stocks.
1860 2018-03-10 19:45:52 .@NPR or hear's another accurate alternative: IN AN EFFORT TO TIE UP BUMP STOCKS IN ENDLESS LITIGATION... @SenFeinstein spoke clearly about what needs to happen #BanAssaultWeaponsNow
1861 2018-03-10 19:45:21 Ban all assault weapons.  Without them, bump stocks are useless
1862 2018-03-10 19:45:05 The commercial #herring kill fishery in the #SalishSea kicked off in a huge way last week, with a quota of 23,000 tonnes.

1863 2018-03-10 19:44:31 It is not my room per say but the company Trade Ideas. CRYPTO traders will learn how to trade the charts and price action of stocks. And how to use backtesting scans. All of which can translate into trading the altcoins.
1864 2018-03-10 19:43:54 yes...but I think that when you have large mega cap weighted in an indexes, the covering of short positions on derivatives and passive funds will fuel these mega cap stocks indirectly. So let's look at "short positions" as a whole. For minor stocks I think allocation by passive..
1865 2018-03-10 19:42:15 Based on catches as a good reflection of distribution & predominance of stocks UK has every right to tip balance back.
What possible justification for France & Spain to have half alloted TAC on west coast of Scotland.? Does@marineeconomics endorse this situation & it continuing?

1872 2018-03-10 19:37:20 Answer: 18 year olds are adults as such have all constitutional rights and shouldn’t have to be defenseless for 3 arbitrary years. Bump stocks - just a step to banning other accessories. Waiting Period - no other CR has a waiting period. Liberals are untrustworthy is problem.
1873 2018-03-10 19:37:12 Unlike stocks, few cryptos have a delivered product, let alone an MVP. You're essentially purchasing call options with no expiration.
1874 2018-03-10 19:36:57 Bump stocks are a loophole to allow unqualified ppl to acquire full-auto capability for a semi-auto. Good going, President Trump. A bump stock used in florida's shooting would've been so much more devastating. Ppl should turn in all bumpstocks.
1875 2018-03-10 19:35:58 If enough cash out of the Federal Reserve casino asap, exchanging fiat currency & make-believe stocks for silver ASE bullets, we'll fire shots heard around the world. This is how We the People implement FedExit and not wait for an election day to start taking the Globalists down.

1883 2018-03-10 19:33:09 so make some laws that the police and FBI can enforce. Bump stocks, AR , any assault rapid fire weapons.
1884 2018-03-10 19:32:58 I am diversified into stocks and will keep diversifying when my alt bags pump hard. This will be a line of tweets of the stocks I hold, the reason why I hold them and so on.

1888 2018-03-10 19:30:42 I am curious: if you are an investor who constructs a portfolio based on replicating an index; but you become anxious about the sustainability of pricing of some stocks in that index (due to reasons specific to that stock, not broader market), what do you as the investor do?
1889 2018-03-10 19:30:04 maybe lets not demonize it so much. Same like with stocks 2008 crash, those who HODLed (even such sh*tty asset class like stocks), today are WELL above pre-crash levels.

1892 2018-03-10 19:27:48 Tbt quand les caresses antillaises coûtaient 1€ au 8a8 à Basse-Terre. On n'a jamais fait de stocks. Nous vivions au jour le jour.
1893 2018-03-10 19:27:30 Capital gains applies to stocks the same way it applies to crypto. You pay short or long term capital gains
1894 2018-03-10 19:26:57 Yes they do. Stocks are considered property
1895 2018-03-10 19:26:46 I HAD PANTS ON BEHIND THE AVACADO DONT TELL MUM
1896 2018-03-10 19:25:52 Ewwwwss
1897 2018-03-10 19:25:32 It's like a hashtag for stocks. Like $amzn
1898 2018-03-10 19:25:21 Lmfao mistake is throwing away stocks in pools
1899 2018-03-10 19:23:23 I make six figure salary but I don't go to Starbucks coz it's expensive...I have a single serve Keurig brewing machine, good coffee and cheap...I invest my money on stocks instead of Starbucks coffee...be smart!
1900 2018-03-10 19:21:57 Again, I’ve read the law and there is nothing about confiscation. Only age, three day waiting period and bump stocks. Do you remember the name of the interviewee? I’d like to further investigate
1901 2018-03-10 19:21:52 Cease fishing until stocks replenish. Having control of our waters to stop over fishing.
1902 2018-03-10 19:21:28 Que tu répares ma tête et mes sentiments qui fonctionnent plus bien
Que tu refasses mes stocks de sérotonine
Que tu me dises que c'est rien
1903 2018-03-10 19:20:56 The NRA filed suit
Against Florida, saying
The law banning
Bump stocks and
Raising the legal age
To purchase rifles
Is unconstitutional.
Now the DoJ
Is introducing
A regulation that
Bans bump stocks.
This issue is headed
For SCOTUS.
1904 2018-03-10 19:20:18 Canadian banks were the most active they have been in years on share buybacks. That makes sense to me given their stocks went nowhere for months and capital ratios are more than required.
1905 2018-03-10 19:19:29 Stocks will be peaking during the midterms and this will ensure a Republican sweep.
1906 2018-03-10 19:18:57 How fu****G  foolish!!!  As if BUMP STOCKS   were the primary cause of the Parkland shootings!!  How  absolutely  OFF point can these  political  shit heads  veer!!!!
1907 2018-03-10 19:18:53 Justice Department files regulation to Ashley Young 'bump stocks'
1908 2018-03-10 19:18:25 Maybe it will go to put more assault weapons into the hands of children? Blood on your hands. And I don't hate guns, I do hate inadequate background checks, and assault weapons and bump stocks that don't belong in the hands of civilians
1909 2018-03-10 19:17:00 TJU - just curious. Are you ok with tougher background checks, eliminating the gun show loophole and making bump stocks illegal? Just to see if we have any common ground...
1910 2018-03-10 19:14:29 Dude, i don't need lessons on market economics from u and importantly u need to understand that indian stock market is not the ultimate indicator of India's economy as investment in stocks is way below domestic savings.
1911 2018-03-10 19:12:45 Tax ammo whatever they call it these days the bump stocks, magazine whatever accessory to it, taxing the body of the child, tax that weapon out of existence, tax the proliferation of it, tax militarization, tax the furor's fury, whoever it is these days, tax the bombs--man made
1912 2018-03-10 19:12:39 cheers mate.. yes strictly price action.. i pick stocks based on a list of in-play stocks I create each morning. I make this list based on Asx news, relevant offshore moves, commodity overnight prices, ETFs, broker upgrades/downgrades etc.
1913 2018-03-10 19:11:59 All the freebies to oil& gas.  You know he has stocks in Mobile Exon.  He's working on their behalf-not America.
1914 2018-03-10 19:11:08 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
1915 2018-03-10 19:10:41 The EU policy cannot "increase stocks". It can limit damage, and even prevent it, preserving stock fecundity and genetic variability where the scientific advice is applied and ENFORCED. But yr after yr policy has allowed higher limits (often) than fish scientists recommended.
1916 2018-03-10 19:09:11 Sessions & his DOJ are more interested in banning bump stocks,SMH
1917 2018-03-10 19:08:17 I’m thinking of putting some Stocks in my braids.
1918 2018-03-10 19:08:15 low key hoping i’ll be put on registers today if only because i don’t want to deal with stocking up line bc Nobody Stocks Before Leaving
1919 2018-03-10 19:08:04 @RevlonUK Why is it so hard to find Revlon Colorsilk in the UK, ammonia free, easy to use, the best home product I have found to cover the grey! Savers is the only shop that stocks it but not consistently!
1920 2018-03-10 19:07:41 It's so obvious This has been Going on! See how quiet Trump is about stocks and shares after giving all the inside info??
1921 2018-03-10 19:07:05 Associated Press: Justice Department proposes banning rapid-fire bump stocks
1922 2018-03-10 19:07:02 When will you do something to prevent these killings?  No bump stocks-better background checks-stop sales if AR15s
1923 2018-03-10 19:06:20 We want to address it all and save some lives. NRA won’t even allow gun violence to be studied, universal background checks or end the gun show loophole. Maybe if bump stocks & AR-15’s weren’t easily available 76 people would be alive today just from the last 2 mass murders.
1924 2018-03-10 19:04:52 The NRA doesn't work to prevent all gun laws. They support a ban on bump stocks, and they don't mind a ban on many assault weapons. The idea that the NRA is responsible for the carnage in America is bullshit.
1925 2018-03-10 19:04:48 I don't get it. Does banning these bump stocks mean the guns can't be fired? Does that mean someone without a bump stock can't shoot to kill any longer?
1926 2018-03-10 19:02:53 Wes Welker, randy moss, aqib talib, Blount, Revis. Pats made their stocks way better when they signed with NE in FA. Yeah their have been busts but still those are just some.
1927 2018-03-10 19:02:07 Stocks are tricky!
1928 2018-03-10 19:01:29 But EU policy is responsible for increasing stocks, not decreasing?
1929 2018-03-10 19:00:43 Brexit is unlikely to improve things for British fishing and may make things a whole lot worse. Especially no deal. UK vessels would lose access to EU waters, conflicts with EU fleet.
Higher quotas would result in overfishing & damage the stocks. Trade barriers would be erected.
1930 2018-03-10 19:00:34 ***And then a run ensues*** ... Sorry
1931 2018-03-10 19:00:03 The markets are unforgiving, and emotional trading always results in losses. forex stocks
1932 2018-03-10 18:59:54 Stocks don’t go down on bad news fully anticipated - it’s already baked into price. Similarly with trump and Stormy .
1933 2018-03-10 18:59:32 Where is Groupon? GoPro? I love how they picked the day the market bottomed, 5 tech stocks that had a good run

1935 2018-03-10 18:57:56 Selling stocks won't help these Traitors.
1936 2018-03-10 18:57:11 Thanks. Yes. Concern; the trend is up, but by far the biggest problem (clearly) is EU allowed decimation of stocks which it's supposed to safeguard. CFP has always been about politics. Scientists not listened to. Caution, or genetic damage to stocks will worsen irrecoverably.
1937 2018-03-10 18:56:49 Bump stocks are unnecessary. But I’ve held an AR-15 and honestly they aren’t nearly as scary as people make them out to be. It’s just a rifle like any other. Actually, it’s a great rifle for a girl like myself because its small size makes it very easy to handle.
1938 2018-03-10 18:56:13 Les négros stocks qui écoutent du Marwa Loud vous êtes où ? Manifestons nous non ?
1939 2018-03-10 18:55:26 L'énorme désavantage c'est l'injustice du procédé (ne plus regarder les stocks de revenus donc les patrimoines c'est faire un trait sur une politique de justice sociale).
1940 2018-03-10 18:54:59 For sure. I bought a couple low end stocks just for fun. But I'm only out like $30 if anything happens
1941 2018-03-10 18:54:40 I would have thought stalled demand would led to increased gas stocks.  Seems to have been slower growth of gas stocks.  Agree demand should now pick up.
1942 2018-03-10 18:54:30 Thats cos stocks etc are traded only on one exchange . So u can wipe out an order book . Btc has multiple exchanges with prices on demand and supply. So no one order book to wipe out
1943 2018-03-10 18:53:57 I have taken screenshot of portfolio 90% down to teach me lesson not to be euphoric when stocks are making money.
1944 2018-03-10 18:53:49 Justice Department filed to ban bump stocks so I guess one good thing has happened in this sea of shit
1945 2018-03-10 18:52:01 It appears slower growth in gas stocks this winter was affected by gas product being supplied.  As gas being supplied never hit lows of prev yrs, growth of gas stocks was slower.  Now, last wk was gas prod suppl 9.276mbd vs 9.268mbd 2017.  Likely back on trend. #OOTT #EIAreport
1946 2018-03-10 18:51:23 Es probable que diesel ni siquiera en 2025. Y mientras las compañías tradicionales venderán los stocks a los más escépticos a precios "de ganga" para autofinanciar su propia reconversión.
1947 2018-03-10 18:48:00 Reactionary politics will only take us so far. Bump stocks have been around forever. Many have known of this threat. Why do our so called "leaders" have 2 see this much death to do something? We have to do a better job electing leaders that get ahead of problems!
1948 2018-03-10 18:47:46 We have had a change of heart... Assault weapons, bump stocks, hand guns should ultimately be banned! The least amount of guns the better for our entire country. We need to step outside of what has been ingrained in us. #GunControl #GunContolNow #GunRights #GunControlNever
1949 2018-03-10 18:47:12 Equal weight S&P under-performed cap weight once again on Friday. Largest cap stocks continue to lead.
1950 2018-03-10 18:46:58 Don´t worry retailers you will have time enough to close your positions easily, you will have time to slowly change your mind while the stocks are just going down a bit. Do you wanna be the next 2 years in a 20% average downfall market?
Don´t think and buy the dip. A pig is a pig

1954 2018-03-10 18:44:42 Should be ban straight away it’s dangerous as hell this modification or device (Bump fire stocks) are gunstocks that are specially designed to make bump firing easier, which allows semi-automatic firearms to mimic the firing speed of fully automatic firearms
1955 2018-03-10 18:44:39 Banning bump stocks, in no way, infringes upon a citizens right to bear arms.
1956 2018-03-10 18:44:14 "Bump Off Bump Stocks"  The Justice Department today introduced a regulation that would make it illegal to possess or sell bump stocks, the widgets that turn semiautomatic rifles into machineguns like those used in the Las Vegas massacre. Yay!

1963 2018-03-10 18:41:28 Actually, that sounds pretty good to me. The Rangeland Manger here says that the stocking rate is 3.5 per 640 acre section in my area. Privately owned land stocks 3 or 4 times this amount depending on location. That's still not much. It's pretty dry here.
1964 2018-03-10 18:39:42 Yes sure.
As much as I have learnt from Jatin:
1. he try to focus on growing business at reasonable price.
2. Don't like to speculate on companies like PNB.
3.understanding businesses, management, growth prospects, competitors and the valuations are key factors to look in stocks.
1965 2018-03-10 18:38:35 Would you like some second hand uniform to replenish stocks?

1973 2018-03-10 18:35:00 Honest question- what's the deal with bump stocks?

1980 2018-03-10 18:27:38 3) Also, their opposition for LC magazines and bump stocks restrictions means easier access for guns capable of slaughtering many people at once with little chance to be stopped, just what terrorists and mass-murderers want.
1981 2018-03-10 18:25:31 We should definitely support a ban on bump stocks but we should take care that this is not a bone thrown to us to avoid action on semiautomatic weapons!
1982 2018-03-10 18:25:27 Yes. Obviously...

1984 2018-03-10 18:23:40 The weapons laws we have in America are amusing:
At 18, you can get a rifle (what was used in various school shootings).
Some knives are illegal to possess (batangas, pilum, etc).
Bump stocks are still legal, full auto fireams not so much.

1990 2018-03-10 18:19:07 Actually guns have changed or we would still have muskets (tied to the days of 2A addition).Bump stocks are an example.That being said, society has changed. There are MANY factors that need to be addressed. It is a complicated situation requiring balanced talks from all sides

1993 2018-03-10 18:18:18 Hi there, I am very sorry about this. I have checked the stocks for milk in our main store in Slough and I have found that our last deliveries for milk was yesterday at approximately 10pm.

1995 2018-03-10 18:16:03 My cannabis stocks are not performing! When are these slackers gonna get their act together & get to work? Oh wait…… 
1996 2018-03-10 18:15:26 I'm not in the one percent but I get 60 extra bucks a week tax reform helped me.  Stocks rise and fall. Improving economy- 1st time home buyers increased. Jobs increasing, stock market is making everyone money who's in it. Meeting Kim is a matter of when not if.
1997 2018-03-10 18:14:30 Look at cannabis stocks.  Predictions abound that they will crash, based on extremely observable data.  Yet, they continue to hold exceedingly absurd valuations, and attract funds.  This is an example of a known being ignored, resulting in an absurd valuation.
1998 2018-03-10 18:14:04 The Justice Department formally submitted regulations on Saturday to ban 'bump stocks.'

2000 2018-03-10 18:13:41 I'm soooooooooo for the hearing protection act and getting rid of the SBR stamp. 

Bump stocks? Sure, NFA them.
2001 2018-03-10 18:13:01 Bump stocks are awesome, face reality, guns exist, ain’t nobody taking them away, just make punishment more harsh for armed robbers and people that carry guns in public.
2002 2018-03-10 18:11:50 Just watch all the stocks you really like and wait for one to offer what you would consider a really decent entry/dip
2003 2018-03-10 18:11:41 If Trump wants to parade our military, perhaps he should allow those homeless vets to tote the 5 million legally obtained AR-15 assault rifles, complete with bump stocks and hi capacity magazines, down Pennsylvania Avenue while he prominently observes close by, from the stands.
2004 2018-03-10 18:11:13 I'm sick and tired of these liberals coming on @FoxNews and lying to my face. Some old Hillary campaigner came on and said that Trump has had a horrible few days. Horrible? 313,000 REAL jobs announced, Steel Tariffs, meeting agreed with Jong-Un, pardoned Saucier, stocks up +440

2009 2018-03-10 18:10:45 The same result will repeat itself when #DOJ bans bump stocks.
2010 2018-03-10 18:10:44 This is an unacceptable infringement. The stock is a stock it doesn’t mechanically alter the firearm. This is a clear overreach by the Justice Department. Furthermore the ATF has already deemed the stocks legal for this reason.
2011 2018-03-10 18:10:31 Pick on this:
No guns until 21yo
No bump stocks
Ban AR-15s, equivalent guns
Ban multi-shot clips
Ban body-shredding ammo
Universal background checks & gun registration 
“Red flag” restraining orders
No guns if on no fly list
Boycott NRA
Vote out NRA puppets
2012 2018-03-10 18:10:24 DOJ now wants bump stocks included in machine gun ban/regulation - is it constitutional for any body except Congress to make law that holds citizens punishable by loss of their individual liberty?

2015 2018-03-10 18:07:45 @SenatorBurr 2nd Amendment not intended for people to arm themselves to shoot innocent people! Overturn the Dickey Amendment. Ban assault weapons except for those needed by the military & police; ban bump stocks.

2017 2018-03-10 18:06:47 #WeCallBS Why don’t you write legislation to enact meaningful gun reform & #BanAssaultWeapons instead? Oh and ask trump where his EO banning bump stocks is. #NeverAgain
2018 2018-03-10 18:06:00 You have to study charts deeply, apply your technical knowledge, and select those stocks in which your study works best and makes you confident to trade in those stocks

2021 2018-03-10 18:03:59 Agree @DB_Stocks . $mspc is legit, bashers are out for the sole reason to steal your shares for cheap... Days go by and then a ensues
2022 2018-03-10 18:03:14 And if look at the dynamics of stocks since begining of February (total of oil+gasoline+disel) it would be inline with 2017 nonetheless much lesser net import
2023 2018-03-10 18:02:35 But no recall of existing bump stocks?
2024 2018-03-10 18:01:15 Justice Dept. files regulation to ban bump stocks... Trump really is coming for our guns.
2025 2018-03-10 18:00:58 But Trump said on March 1 that bump stocks are “done.”  Interesting.
2026 2018-03-10 18:00:35 2nd Amend not intended for people to arm themselves to shoot innocent people! Overturn the Dickey Amendment. Ban assault weapons except for those needed by the military &  police; ban bump stocks. NRA funded Rep. Steve Chabot for  $113,689.

2027 2018-03-10 18:00:31 @cspanwj Soon investors will be able to choose between bonds, stocks, and real estate to invest their savings in!  We’ll have a real economy again!  We need the FED to shrink the balance sheet and keep inflation at bay!  #PJNET #TCOT #TLOT #P2 #FED
2028 2018-03-10 18:00:06 I think ledge hogging is good because it made stocks go faster, and in this game it would be good. The main thing about ledge in this game that I like is the lack of invincibility on regrab, since it makes stalling impossibls

2031 2018-03-10 17:59:34 IS ANNOYING LMAO just fuck me up 0-2 Melee style, make it end asap. Take those stocks asap
2032 2018-03-10 17:59:34 Actually that's false. 

Just like right after the tax breaks, corporations started buying back their stocks, artificially inflating them 

Like I said just parroting bullet points
2033 2018-03-10 17:58:21 L'énorme avantage de l'imposition des flux est que leur assiette est évidente et constatée explicitement lors de la transaction qui en est le fait générateur ...

A whopping 313,000 people entered the U.S. workforce in February, crushing the economists’ expectation of 205,000 by more than 50 percent.
2035 2018-03-10 17:57:39 Cheap and common, agreed. Maybe that IS the only issue then. If not just anyone could walk into Wal-Mart and buy one and then buy bump stocks, extended magazines, high-powered scopes, etc...

Again, things citizens do not need.
2036 2018-03-10 17:56:38 If you’re trading options, then of course next step into less volatile position would be stocks you want to hold several yrs or ETF’s some of which also earn dividends. Funds would be even less risk but nothing beats cash on hand in big corrections.
2037 2018-03-10 17:56:16 Well, that was obvious and why I asked you as a gun owner who is okay with a ban on bump stocks and reasonable rules, and regulations why others think I should be against this? This seems reasonable.
2038 2018-03-10 17:54:47 Anyone here trading stocks?!
2039 2018-03-10 17:54:26 I agree. Don't get greedy these OTC stocks drop very quick take safe profits
2040 2018-03-10 17:53:00 Actually it is. It’s little people like you and I that invest in stocks and we want to make money from those stocks.
2041 2018-03-10 17:51:26 U want bump stocks legal?
2042 2018-03-10 17:51:06 Baha well yes that would be great:) let's see what happens with Janssen this year maybe we'll get close
2043 2018-03-10 17:50:52 We have the second biggest fleet and second biggest catch in the EU.  Fish catches have been in decline since 1800s, and in last 20 years as part of the effort to replenish fish stocks. No one is stealing our lunch here.
2044 2018-03-10 17:49:57 J’ai vraiment peur de pas avoir les extras que je veux pour la dmwc2, je prie pour les stocks sur place 
2045 2018-03-10 17:48:38 Yeah! Alright! Ban bump stocks! Surely nobody figured out how to bump fire witha  rubber band or anything. Ban rubber bands too!

Ban everything we don’t like or are afraid of! Only way to be safe. 

Ban air and water too, those can kill you too, when they’re misused.
2046 2018-03-10 17:48:11 I'm an (I), not anti-gun. I'm anti gen pop owning semi-auto, automatic guns & things like bump stocks. I'm for THOROUGH  background checks, including @  gun shows.

No more internet sales of guns 2 gen pop either. Not until internet sellers can w/o doubt verify who buyer is.
2047 2018-03-10 17:47:38 Well the socialists didnt show up for the last DACA deal. Australia is on board with the new trade deals along with Japan and SK. He did deal with gun negotiations about bump stocks. Do you habitually ignore things or is denial your thing?

2054 2018-03-10 17:41:11 Regardless, yes, bump stocks make rifles much less accurate, burn through more ammunition, create significant safety hazards, and are impractical for both hunting and personal defense.  They only seem useful for shooting lots of packed targets indiscrimin.. oh wait.
2055 2018-03-10 17:40:58 I get that part but I'm not in the industry so I don't know what that infers for the future.  Stocks going down?  Climate change causing food supply increases?
2056 2018-03-10 17:39:02 So, after seeing the videos, please explain to me how banning bump stocks makes anyone more safe? 

It’s an unnecessary novelty item. Nothing more.
2057 2018-03-10 17:38:00 No I'm not, I see no need for bump stocks, unless you have a class III FFL, I am 100% agenst raising the age to buy a long gun for many reasons. And we have only had 2 school shootings and one attempted bombing of a school this year. And one shooting was a accident.
2058 2018-03-10 17:37:56 don't have a problem with eliminating bump stocks, but come on classifying them as something they are not undercuts word definitions.
2059 2018-03-10 17:37:55 Precisely why AR-15s & bump stocks should be banned too.
2060 2018-03-10 17:37:15 "Experts" who have stocks in foreign companies and markets?! 
2061 2018-03-10 17:36:29 The least economically valid argument is Fish stocks. I have to say this is the single issue which London bankers and midland car workers care least about; but it is intrinsic to the identidy politic and a showroom to the efforts of being open for business.
2062 2018-03-10 17:35:29 Had a dream I went into a betting shop and started smugly declaring how much more likely it was to turn a profit by investing in stocks and shares than betting on the football
2063 2018-03-10 17:35:03 i still got my rifle and shotty at least but my rifle isn’t automatic anymore cause this dumb bitch banned bump stocks

2066 2018-03-10 17:34:08 that's why setiap kali bila stocks dah sampai, sy terus balut dgn tape.  tau dah mesti ada tangan yg jenis tak reti dok diam. tak reti beza antara tester dan stock.
2067 2018-03-10 17:33:59 Excuse the abuser, don’t believe the victim, arm the teachers, ban bump stocks...no wait keep bump stocks, ban abortion, cut Medicare, kick transgender soldiers out...wait keep them, build the wall, white supremacists are “good” people too...MAKE IT STOP!!!
2068 2018-03-10 17:33:22 I also need to buy Remember, the second album.
I only have Always, Stand Up, Made and the Japanese version of Alive (I made a mistake, I wanted the Korean one but it’s not in stocks...)
2069 2018-03-10 17:32:33 They need to include "manufacture and possession" of bump stocks in the legislation, not just sale. Otherwise people will just crank 'em out in their workshops.
2070 2018-03-10 17:32:05 It will all work out.  get rid of the lines.  tremendous, believe me, it will be great, easy, believe me... Believe me, this is just double talk, bullshit, a creative distraction from the real issues.  Russia, Stormy, stocks, IMPEACHMENT...JAIL...TREASON.  RELEASE YOUR TAXES.
2071 2018-03-10 17:31:48 Because PoS is used to extend and add security to the blockchain.  So it's not like it's just there to receive dividends like stocks.
2072 2018-03-10 17:31:42 i believe so. lets wait until their suppliers are full of stocks!
2073 2018-03-10 17:29:38 @nra..looks like the Justice department is working on steps to ban bump stocks. That is a good effort Mr. President.  Sadness and prayers are meaningless unless we have strong gun control

2075 2018-03-10 17:28:25 Exactly, when I first got into this space the only experience I had with investing was from stocks/bonds/401K type investing so I used that as my basis for investing in Crypto, has served me well so far, especially in down markets like we’re in right now.
2076 2018-03-10 17:28:21 As they keep reacquiring stocks... they are going to be moving while the merger iron is hot (yes, even than usual) at SEC.

2080 2018-03-10 17:25:26 I agree bump stocks need to be banned but to classify them as ANY form of gun is ridiculous and degrades the law.
What's next? Ammunition being classified as Machine guns because they CAN be fired by one?
Sorry. Slippery slope. No. 
Clearly rewrite this as a bump stock ban.
2081 2018-03-10 17:24:54 Can’t legislate that, so oh well.

Doesn’t mean you shouldn’t ban an obviously unnecessary tool.

No need to have bump stocks, so no need to have them legal.
2082 2018-03-10 17:23:52 Really? Deeply saddened? Were you deeply saddened after your dinner with the NRA a few weeks ago when they made you forget about banning assault rifles, bump stocks and other gun control methods after the death of 17 teen in Parkland? #GunControlNow

2094 2018-03-10 17:17:17 I think he may be off the boards when we pick. His stocks seems to be rising
2095 2018-03-10 17:16:58 You know, I wondered the same thing.  I see no reason for bump stocks to exist, and don't understand why they're supposed to be an issue.

2100 2018-03-10 17:15:00 Better for all sides & individuals to focus on what's needed to make this work. Eyes of the world are on Brexit &fisheries -  neither EU nor UK will risk undermining the work done in re-building stocks & gaining a bad reputation.
2101 2018-03-10 17:14:40 Hi, I'm new to trading and become a follower of you and impressed with your trading. Can I ask you if you normally buy stocks or do you short them also?
2102 2018-03-10 17:14:18 So suprising  that people of minor minority  want us to buy the land that they forcefully removed our ancestors from it and also stole their live stocks. We want our land back and we are not apologetic. That era of blacks being puppets for whites has long past. #Bringbackourland
2103 2018-03-10 17:14:14 So there’s the law of supply and demand coming into play that he discussed. I think that’s also the essential part of O’Neil’s work, that in certain stocks demand builds for them because you have a reason, a cause, which would be the fundamentals.

2125 2018-03-10 17:03:09 This is what the successful value investors have done. Allocate large amounts of capital to high probability value stocks.
2126 2018-03-10 17:03:02 So they should while the hell would public need bump stocks?!  Farmers in the states are the only ones that need guns apart from police and the forces. Just don’t get the mentality of it.

2132 2018-03-10 16:59:26 Haven’t looked at the data but seems like that would be a logical assumption.  Same reason guy is always higher owned week after a big week and why people buy stocks high and not low .
2133 2018-03-10 16:58:10 I know a lot of guns rights activists are upset about this ... but I say, let them have bump stocks ... they’re not that important.  If you really are in a position where you need one, just make a mock bump stock or practice firing quicker.
2134 2018-03-10 16:57:20 Democrats wanted to ban ARs & were against the “guardian program” of arming teacher. The compromise was  raise the minimum age to buy rifles from 18 to 21, extends a 3 day waiting period for handgun & riles, bans bump stocks & called "guardian" program.
2135 2018-03-10 16:57:01 Important fact: these versions don't take eShop sales into account, Nintendo doesn't give them but in most cases they account for around 15% of the total sales. More in the case that were out of stocks such as Xeno 2.

2150 2018-03-10 16:43:07 TYT has found that seven of the 17 Democratic-caucusing senators who voted to advance a financial deregulation bill on Tuesday have direct investments totaling as much as $2.5 million in the corporate stocks of companies that stand to benefit considerably from the bill
2151 2018-03-10 16:43:00 Relationships are like stocks, once you go public everybody wants to put their 2 cents in 
2152 2018-03-10 16:42:18 They are giving us crumbs to appease us.  Banning bump stocks... really???  Bread crumbs...
2153 2018-03-10 16:42:17 Hi, Vishal! We will be replenishing stocks as soon as possible. Please stay tuned to our social accounts for news and updates. We appreciate your patience and understanding.
2154 2018-03-10 16:41:51 The DOJ push for bump stocks creates a lot of confusion. How can a bump stock be a machine gun unless it has a magazine full of ammo?
2155 2018-03-10 16:41:31 It's TIME, the GOP grow some BALLS, by listening to the dead and their survivors, crying out in  desperation, to STOP the innocent destruction of Human Lives, by selling Assault Weapons, Bump Stocks and Extended Multi Capacity Clips.
Unless, it happens to them, it may change.
2156 2018-03-10 16:41:27 By banning bump stocks ? @NRA NRA supporter 100 percent ...
2157 2018-03-10 16:41:05 How do you equate banning bump stocks and raising the age to buy a rifle being equal to grabbing everyone’s guns?
2158 2018-03-10 16:40:20 J’hallucine içi sur @ASOS y’a que 7 paires en 36 renouvellez vos stocks nn ?
2159 2018-03-10 16:40:17 Rupture de stocks ! Nous allons voir avec @Cultura pour réapprovisionner dans quelque temps  merci à tous !

2161 2018-03-10 16:39:54 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.131.私たちの株式投資への意欲をなくさせるような要因がかなりある。
2162 2018-03-10 16:38:40 It’s called toxic masculinity paired with gun culture. And there is NO need for bump stocks. How you’re even arguing for them means to me, you certainly shouldn’t be able to own guns.
2163 2018-03-10 16:38:30 Bas yahi kami thi for pharma stocks!
2164 2018-03-10 16:38:19 We can beat the gun issue all day long banning rifles and bump stocks from honest taxpaying folks will do nothing to stop the killing criminals will still get these  guns once you ban these items you will create a illegal market for them and places will still manufacture
2165 2018-03-10 16:38:17 I think we conservatives should stop. They want to pass a law banning automatic rifles, go ahead! They want to ban night-ballistic-turbo-clips, let them! High-cap-collapsible-trigger-stocks: GONE!
2166 2018-03-10 16:38:11 @steephillwines in Lincoln also stocks our bottles.
2167 2018-03-10 16:37:47 Stocks soaring, many unemployed back to work,no more tax penalty for not having ripoff priced medical insurance, pissing off the life time crooked politicians and the idiot liberals, getting law and order back in America, securing our borders #MAGA
2168 2018-03-10 16:36:58 @jimcramer I'm new to investing. I entered last month with purchases of MU, SNAP, CY, APPL YEXT & JNJ. My decisions based on my research & your repeated mentions of certain stocks. I want to educate myself better to understand the market & other stocks. What books do you suggest
2169 2018-03-10 16:33:45 I wish he would do some trades on smaller dollar stocks like you trade.
2170 2018-03-10 16:33:29 True, wait until he starts going about “silenced stocks”, he gets crazy.
2171 2018-03-10 16:33:10 DOJ bans bump stocks.
@NRA sh*ts its pants. #bumpstockban
2172 2018-03-10 16:32:56 The NRA said they'll give up the bump stocks, but not the AR-15.
2173 2018-03-10 16:32:33 All in progress though. Did you give your tax break back or donate your increase in stocks? No? Than you are a hypocrite
2174 2018-03-10 16:31:57 What about the illegal bum stocks on the street?All you need is money.
2175 2018-03-10 16:31:01 Nobody said "fully-automatic," or not. Fact is AR-15s banned in some states. If interested in protecting people instead of property speak of bump stocks on AR-15s which with one trigger pull come as close to full auto as makes no diff. Killed 50 in LV + wounded over 400. Please.
2176 2018-03-10 16:30:58 don't track it Rishi, bull run in IT Stocks.
2177 2018-03-10 16:30:31 If it’s in their value system to not have debt, where were they when speculation and criminality were being reported? Most stayed silent. Stocks go up and down. So do homes. Sorry, I’m not a fan of protecting equity gained by turning a blind eye.
2178 2018-03-10 16:30:04 Good point. Any downward moves in leadership stocks is incredibly brief.
2179 2018-03-10 16:29:31 No Twitter in prison, Dimwit Jr. Can’t wait!
2180 2018-03-10 16:29:31 This is extremely dangerous because fundamentally it is about the legal definition of “machine gun”. This is not about bump stocks, this may result in a ban on magazines, and or certain triggers that allow rapid fire. All gun owners should oppose this.
2181 2018-03-10 16:28:59 I didn't realise the #CVR Update came out late (although that explains why I didn't see it around 8am) - I think there's a big element of Bad Luck here and the only effective method I find is Diversification of Stocks.
2182 2018-03-10 16:27:55 This is not even a bandaid to fix the bump stock issue.  It will take months to happen,  just allows Trump to say he is doing it.  He can remove laws to protect our water, air and parks with just a stroke of the pen.  Why can't he do the same with bump stocks?  #GunReformNow
2183 2018-03-10 16:26:59 I'm waiting for a price drop. Like stocks. I think the price will drop day or two or for sure day of.
2184 2018-03-10 16:25:29 AND..to
You and those who support the NRA .
The Second Amendment was written long ago...Read up on it. You might learn something.
Do you think its writers envisioned assault rifles, bump stocks?
Do you want to make gun makers richer?
2185 2018-03-10 16:24:56 Florida's refusal to ban assault weapons renders these new laws meaningless. Banning bump stocks, funding mental health and raising the age requirement by 3 years will do nothing to reduce the proliferation of these massacre-type weapons in society. There is no reason to applaud.
2186 2018-03-10 16:22:28 Imagine being able to go back in time to 2005 and invest in Google stocks. $NAS $Nebulas #Nebulas
2187 2018-03-10 16:22:00 People who manufacture, sell bump stocks and automatics need to be looked at if this is where you plan to go #ASSHAT
2188 2018-03-10 16:21:42 Extremely bad news. Most stocks would have collapsed on news CAO leaving with no notice or explanation
2189 2018-03-10 16:21:11 Had to read it twice to make sure it didn't say "Banning Regulation of Bump Stocks"...which would not have surprised me.
2190 2018-03-10 16:21:07 Reasonable is universal background checks, "red flag" laws, closing the "boyfriend" loophole, limiting ammunition sales, banning bump stocks & oh yeah, not putting weapons of mass destruction in the hands of teenagers.
Guessing your definition of reasonable is different from mine
2191 2018-03-10 16:20:41 Then they buy apple stocks, they fucking buy stocks from a trillion dollar company, and i just..
2192 2018-03-10 16:20:20 this will become great news when his stocks are sold and returned to consortium of banks who are crying.  We were told by channels that NiMo seized assets were worth 7500 cr.  But after 2 days of continuous streaming, this breaking news disappeared.  Why disappeared. Nobody knows
2193 2018-03-10 16:20:00 @amjoyshow outlaw NRA, ban assault rifles, ban bump stocks, ban gun shows,  extreme background checks, increase age to 21 to purchase a gun!!!!
2194 2018-03-10 16:19:52 Darren, cash in some of your stocks and bonds  #NHLSaskatoon #Owner
2195 2018-03-10 16:19:31 I can already tell they're about to waste their money cause you're not supposed to fucking buy stocks if you don't have a minimum of £100k TO SPARE.
2196 2018-03-10 16:19:21 When Steel Traiff hiked in US, it is natural that metals stocks fall. Moreover metals stocks out performed in the last 1 to 2 years. Many stocks shot up by more than 100%. So naturally profit booking will be there when this kind of bad news comes.
2197 2018-03-10 16:19:05 @theyeezymafia why can I go through the whole check out process press place order and then have adidas crash
2198 2018-03-10 16:18:33 Does anyone else feel like the Trump admin was ready to ban bump stocks when Las Vegas happened but decided to hold out for when this issue eventually reached a breaking point (i.e. now) so they could look like they were actually doing something w/o *really* pissing off the NRA
2199 2018-03-10 16:17:48 #stocks#SaturdayMorning   When Jimmy Carter was presid this was one of the best times to have loaded up on blue chip stocks since 1929.. Then again during G W. Bush's presidency when the  S&P 500 declined and was lower when he left office than when he entered it.
2200 2018-03-10 16:17:35 Then comes ye olde 'Me and bae are buying stocks together' and i'm thinking "Oh dear god, they're about to waste their money trying to be cute"
2201 2018-03-10 16:16:55 Gun control: US justice department moves to ban rapid-fire bump stocks
2202 2018-03-10 16:16:53 1.  I am an avid supporter of the 2A.  I have plenty of guns in my house.  I support this new bill signed by Governor Scott.  It allows some teachers to get deputised and conceal carry.  It bans bump stocks, but let's be honest, bump stocks are a novelty anyway.
2203 2018-03-10 16:15:14 @adidas fix your website I am sick of being bated into thinking I can buy something and then having the site crash
2204 2018-03-10 16:14:02 But metal stocks got butchered!! Nifty doesn’t matter....look/present things into prospective if sharing on public forums!!
2205 2018-03-10 16:13:53 @realDonaldTrump Hey did you send your kids to schools with guns in every room? Not a safe environment for anyone involved. Pull your head out of your arse and ban bump stocks and all war guns from those who own them. WHY WOULD THEY OWN A gun of war that you use in a war Not Safe
2206 2018-03-10 16:13:51 Guys guy guys.. any idea when the Heafy Snøfall epiphone is due to hit your stocks? (6 string one)

2208 2018-03-10 16:13:42 Thank you Mr. President for banning bump stocks
2209 2018-03-10 16:12:24 DeVos is a corporate schill. She probably has gun mfg stocks. She has no credentials for this position. #FireDeVos
2210 2018-03-10 16:12:17 Why doesn't the DOJ take after the state of Florida it's lawmakers @FLGovScott & ban bump stocks all together. Guess Florida is more wants to be on the right side of history & not @realDonaldTrump & his playground of an Administration #GunContolNow #Parkland
2211 2018-03-10 16:12:08 Now I will say, that trying to bring the steel industry back could help. We'll need steel supports to hold up solar panels. But, telling all of his friends to drop their stocks in foreign steel, just before he imposes tariffs on foreign steel, not the brightest move.
2212 2018-03-10 16:12:00 I agree & what he did was minimal! It makes him look like he did something. Raising the age to 21 is no big deal. Bump stocks don't matter if you get rid of assault weapons. Arming someone in the school is just adding more guns! He needs to ban assault weapons period!

2215 2018-03-10 16:08:03 Wow. We're getting rid of bump stocks and raising the gun age to 21. OMG I feel SO MUCH SAFER, says no one anywhere 
2216 2018-03-10 16:07:54 Spain next Sunday xxx
2217 2018-03-10 16:07:37 I hope the teachers get bump stocks to really do the job!
2218 2018-03-10 16:07:29 And while it can’t be converted to full auto directly, bump stocks make it “in effect” a fully automatic rifle. 
Not that it matters. Reading up on the damage done by these bullets is what’s different. People shot with these are less likely to survive.
2219 2018-03-10 16:06:19 Um, I'm pretty sure they need legislation from Congress, not a bureaucrat arbitrarily classifying bump stocks as "machine guns". If the Obama admin. did this, the Right would have a conniption over executive overreach.
2220 2018-03-10 16:06:05 You don't need to know too much when you trade stocks or currencies. Your strategy matters but not as much as you think. What matters more is how you deal with wins and losses. Do you stay rational or become irrational? That's where people mess up the most.
2221 2018-03-10 16:05:56 Trump administration takes first step to ban bump stocks

2223 2018-03-10 16:05:12 Congratulations to #GovernorRickScott for the new Florida law regulating firearm sales: from 18 to 21, three-days waiting period, ban of bump stocks, money for #mentalhealth and #schoolsafety programs. Scott acting to prevent another #tragedy in his state. #NRA likes it or not.
2224 2018-03-10 16:05:02 I haven't listened to CNBS in about 15 years.  Their HATRED of gold and buy buy buy stocks at all times was too much.
2225 2018-03-10 16:05:01 Doesn't he get more annoying and irritating, every time you see him or hear him?
I'd really like to see him in the stocks and have a few bags of rotten apples handy.
2226 2018-03-10 16:04:27 I just heard on the radio that bump stocks turn semi automatic rifles into machineguns, hmmm?
2227 2018-03-10 16:04:15 Listen to #Brexiteers - they invariably speak about UK Territorial Waters - that’s the 12 mile limit to you or me.

2232 2018-03-10 16:01:03 Bump stocks are banned because of great recoil compensator or something? From 1st glance it looks kinda uncomfortable when shooting with it like cmon :v
2233 2018-03-10 16:00:36 Companies routinely buy back stocks when they have good years. It is sound financial strategy & a great thing for the employees who depend on their company for retirement & wages. Their is no down side to working for a strong company with good financial discipline.
2234 2018-03-10 16:00:27 You haven't had to mow down deer in your yard before? Bump stocks make it quick and messy.
2235 2018-03-10 16:00:25 My 5 year old just asked me "why do the people with ties on TV keep saying that stocks with have an ouchie if the 10 yr goes above 3%. Why don't they see that stocks will be the flight to safety form gov bonds? I want fruit loops.
2236 2018-03-10 15:59:26 Ban the manufacture, sale, and possession of bump stocks. These things have no use for  self defense or hunting.
2237 2018-03-10 15:59:24 Arggghhh... Bump stocks are only a tiny, almost insignificant, part of the problem. The problem is DETACHABLE MAGAZINES and HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES. A bump stock is meaningless if you have to stop to reload after 5 shots. @delaneytarr
2238 2018-03-10 15:58:54 No. Stocks Stocks Stocks
2239 2018-03-10 15:58:38 Ok with ATF limiting bump stocks as they can easily reverse decision. Laws will end up making rubber bands and belt loops illegal (or more likely semi automatic rifles)
2240 2018-03-10 15:58:23 Stocks are fun but have you tried 3x bull & bear ETF’s?

#GunReformNow #BANTHESALEOFAR15s
2244 2018-03-10 15:56:55 This should not be a hard thing. Nobody needs bump stocks. The majority of Americans agree. It's only purpose is to facilitate mowing down people rapidly. Period.
2245 2018-03-10 15:56:44 There are 3D printer files, for making bump stocks, floating around the internet. Why go to the store and spend all that money, when you can just print your own?

2253 2018-03-10 15:54:43 If stocks buy back are funneled into higher stock price then indirectly employees who are on retirement plan will see the benefit. Plus if co is making money chances of loosing your job decrease( not always).
2254 2018-03-10 15:54:13 Bump stocks are just stocks that are loosely attached to the rifle. You hold the stock firmly, hold your finger in front of the trigger, then push forward on the rifle with your other hand, pushing the trigger into your finger. What mechanism?
2255 2018-03-10 15:53:59 Just a normal correction will do. Stocks don't go up every year, every 5-7 years you have a negative year. It's been 9 years going up now so odds become very high the year of correction is this year.
2256 2018-03-10 15:53:58 Bump stocks probably saved lives at Vegas; early reports were many bump fire stock rifles were inoperable.

2259 2018-03-10 15:52:01 Let me be clear I was speaking in a generality and that was my mistake not blaming you but some of the reporting I have heard in general...it's just a hard subject....I raised to girls and we need solutions but this did little with exception of  bump stocks and trng/arming tchrs
2260 2018-03-10 15:51:46 the gom i ordered from hasn't received the stocks in sg yet so....
2261 2018-03-10 15:50:37 I can carve a bowl out of wood but the likelyhood of me doing that dramatically decreases when I can go to the store and buy a premade one. Banning bump stocks only helps.
2262 2018-03-10 15:50:30 Banning bump stocks is doable. very few gun owners have or want them,  except that to get this done you will need bi-partisan support and both sides insist on all or nothing legislation. That equals status quo. Opportunity lost.
2263 2018-03-10 15:50:00 Why did you tell @Emma4Change that the NRA supports banning bump stocks, and now the NRA is fighting to stop a ban in Florida?
2264 2018-03-10 15:49:25 I was livid when people suggested 2 stocks and it got through back in the days.. I couldn’t believe that people actually wanted it. Now a new smash will arrive.. what‘s next? 1 stock?
2265 2018-03-10 15:49:24 And they are two stocks to avoid as well.  Unfortunately those are the only two airlines that fly BOS to SAV...

2269 2018-03-10 15:46:58 Bump stocks are automatic weapons.  Ban them.  It doesn't matter whether the mechanism involved falls within what regulators at the time imagined or not.

2275 2018-03-10 15:43:46 Congrats to Trump for doing the bare minimum... as if that will in any way satisfy those calling for increased gun control.

Banning bump stocks will not do a damn thing to prevent mass shootings.
2276 2018-03-10 15:41:00 Stocks are correlated because they use the same unit of measurement -- the Dollar. The dollar is inflated by ~2% every year, so each stock should theoretically gain 2% a year if the company is operating in equilibrium.
2277 2018-03-10 15:40:51 Ya it did create a “guardian program”. (My bad missed that)Which I don’t agree with teachers having guns. However the rest of what it did is a great start. Including banning bump stocks. The article says a lot more than the video.

2282 2018-03-10 15:39:46 Exactly, we need to not only ban bump stocks, we have to have weapons like the AR 15 banned as well. We need to have tighter security at schools so that not everyone can enter until they have been through a security check.

2290 2018-03-10 15:34:38 No one is advocating a ban on handguns, shotguns or hunting rifles. It's about regulation, insurance, banning bump stocks, high capacity, silencers, etc.
2291 2018-03-10 15:32:53 Very simple Risk Management, my way:

Big caps-non volatile: Position 10% of portfolio - 10% stop --> 1% Risk
Mid caps-non volatile: Position 8% of portfolio - 12% stop --> 0.98% Risk
Volatile stocks: Position 6% of portfolio - 15% stop --> 0.89 % Risk.

2293 2018-03-10 15:31:10 If you are not looking for opportunities globally and only within certain region than possibly yes. In case of the above ( crypto, stocks and gold ) I am still very confident that each of them will outperform cash given average inflation rate in western countries.

2298 2018-03-10 15:28:35 No true Stephen. Florida jist passed the 21 age to own a gun and bump stocks as well. The NRA is pissed at Florida Governor. I'm glad I'm at Spring Training to see it 1st hand. #WayToGoFlorida
2299 2018-03-10 15:27:36 What is this about? There have been no attacks with bump stocks. What is the reason?
2300 2018-03-10 15:27:24 I don't care about bump stocks. They are stupid in the first place and they are a minor issue. We have a lot bigger problems than that.

2304 2018-03-10 15:25:31 Seems like a lot of good people are happy to call these stocks out.  I expect there will still be lurkers in the shadows and especially on the siloed bulletin boards, although I rarely look these days.  Good Job Riddler. 
2305 2018-03-10 15:24:49 @realDonaldTrump RELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS and PROVE you have no financial ties to Russia
~What about those Russian Sanctions?
~ What happened to that Executive Order on Bump Stocks? Or are you afraid of the NRA?
~Did you pay your lawyer back that 130 grand?
2306 2018-03-10 15:24:14 Lanz took his moms responsibily stored, legal guns and bump stocks...killed her, 20 babies and 7 teachers. Is it time to talk about it yet? It’s been 5 years. Most guns used in mass shootings were “legal and responsibly stored”. Till somebody stole mommy, daddy or grandpas guns.
2307 2018-03-10 15:23:41 No one is taking away rights. What is the issue with raising the age limit to 21? What is wrong with banning bump stocks? What is wrong with a 3 day waiting period for all background checks to be processed more effectively? People touting trampling on the 2nd only see one side
2308 2018-03-10 15:23:02 Bump stocks are so irrelevant. The fact you bring them up shows you have no argument. Any weapon can be used as an "Assault weapon" so you want to ban all weapons? The 2a is more relevant today than ever. It's about the preservation of freedom why is that so hard to understand

#GunReformNow
2311 2018-03-10 15:21:38 I think taking away assault style guns and bump stocks is what they need to do, not all guns..and raising the age for gun owners.. also the background checks and communication between agencies needs to be better... Florida is off to a good start but needs to be every state.

2317 2018-03-10 15:19:55 Your words are empty without action. Choose lives over NRA money and do, at the very least, what you promised. Ban bump stocks.
2318 2018-03-10 15:19:39 Stocks swing like @realDonaldTrump 's opinion at a beauty pageant. Stocks today are no more value based than bitcoin.

2323 2018-03-10 15:16:49 Will they require people who already have bump stocks to turn them in for destruction? Or will they "grandfather in" the existing ones like they did with hi-cap magazines? 
Also, is it just bump stocks or will they ban ANY device that increases rate of fire, like trigger cranks?
2324 2018-03-10 15:15:57 I'm not one to speak though.. I currently have about 6 or 7 different film stocks in my camera bag alone! Oh, and that's just the 120 rolls!
2325 2018-03-10 15:15:32 From a gun guy perspective, bump stocks are all but useless and can be made from scratch easily... will do nothing.

2330 2018-03-10 15:13:09 The 11/2007-2/2009 bear market saw stocks lose almost -60%, worst decline since The Great Depression.  Instead of bailing out and trying to “preserve principal,” staying invested in a globally diversified stock portfolio you would have fully recovered by 4/2011, just two years!

2369 2018-03-10 14:45:06 I get so tired of this narrative.  Human capacity for evil aside, explain to me why an 18 year old needs an AR or bump-stocks?  Or a 14 year old can buy them at a gun show?  How about you human nature that explanation?  No one is trying to take away any handguns/ rifles.  #NRABS
2370 2018-03-10 14:44:43 New Jersey United States already has magazine limits and silences are already illegal. I don't know where you would get a silencer legally in this state, plus you have to have a muzzle brake and you can't have a flash suppressor. Bump stocks are legal, but kind of pointless.
2371 2018-03-10 14:44:30 Just wait n pray lmao
2372 2018-03-10 14:44:15 Wait for it : NRA to litigate against Justice Deoartment for filing regulation to ban “bump stocks”
2373 2018-03-10 14:43:50 So let’s do the things we can all agree on. Background checks - should a felon have a gun? We can agree no. What about accessories like bump stocks and triggers that shoot on pull and release? Necessary, in my view no. Do you disagree?
2374 2018-03-10 14:43:43 Some pot stocks are down around 10% since tweet. May start looking now....
2375 2018-03-10 14:43:40 I think it would be incredibly difficult to maintain that policy as a system. Stocks would be all out if you had to put it through when the customer paid, which you'd have to or it would just be a tip. It'd also be ripe for exploiting by the staff too!
2376 2018-03-10 14:42:58 Yet Indian stocks have been beaten down the most. Panic selling is quite common indian behaviour it seems.

2386 2018-03-10 14:38:28 Reason to be bear in this bull market -
1. Monetary contraction gobally
2. Huge NPAs
3. Most of the people you meet these days talk about mutual funds and stocks
Reason to be bull
1. Past Good returns
2. Namo Magic.

3rd reason is really compelling to be a bear

2392 2018-03-10 14:35:11 I don’t think teachers should have guns . But we don’t need bump stocks or whatever it’s call and we do need mental health evaluations.  I don’t think it’s going against it if the age is going up to 21. What’s so bad about it

2413 2018-03-10 14:22:41 How about we enact #GunReformNow ? Bump stocks is not enough #MoronInChief . #ImpeachTrump #StrongerTogether #BlueWave2018
2414 2018-03-10 14:22:30 Not so.  Just look at a chart of the US stock market.  During the 18 months before Trump was elected, the stock market moved sideways.  Expectations for fiscal expansion from tax cuts, defense & infrastructure spending sent stocks soaring as soon as the election outcome was known
2415 2018-03-10 14:21:44 Well, tanks destroy roads. Be a proud American, we have a super power military. I’d like to see cool new weapons public hasn’t seen but others know we have.
2416 2018-03-10 14:20:17 @RichartRoss Hi Rich, I have enjoyed your commentary on the technical condition of the markets and stocks on FastMoney. I have on multiple occasions asked Melissa Lee when you will be returning to the show and have gotten no response. What gives?
2417 2018-03-10 14:19:27 are you top 10? Your promotion of International stocks has worked very well in 2017, +47% for me.
2418 2018-03-10 14:17:16 It’s not about your guns - it’s about an 18 year old buying a rifle when he’s not legally permitted to buy alcohol. It’s about bump stocks and background checks. Help me understand why any of the above is unreasonable. Please.

2421 2018-03-10 14:16:19 I know EXACTLy what bump stocks do, and my best friend owns an AR-15. Pls don’t engage with someone and make baseless accusations about their knowledge base. Again I ask: do you think bump stocks should remain legal? How about automatic weapons? Do we all have a right to them?
2422 2018-03-10 14:15:34 Exit Adani group stocks if invested
2423 2018-03-10 14:14:53 California Voters: PLEASE remember to vote NO on Prop 3, which would legalize carrying stocks.
2424 2018-03-10 14:14:06 Taj gvk, orient hotel, aksh optifibre, AVT natural, Andhra  cement, DCB, Welspun India. These stocks should be held for next 6 months. market fall in recent past is due to series of unexpected events.
2425 2018-03-10 14:12:55 Not ignoring anything. It’s my opinion that the bigger issue today is assault rifles, bump stocks and high capacity magazines. I believe that there should be restrictions on the second amendment. Tougher gun laws  HAVE worked in other countries that implemented tougher gun laws.
2426 2018-03-10 14:12:34 Are you guys going to sue Florida for not compensating those who bought bump-stocks legal?  I'm anti-bump-stock but the people own them should get financial compensation for surrendering them.
2427 2018-03-10 14:12:08 The chart from EU Mare is based on TACs & combined  landings & the information on the chart is highly  selective & misleading. The red column for coastal states managed stocks is probably  mackerel - a species that's grossly  underestimated.
2428 2018-03-10 14:11:54 true, but you had to be in those stocks and be patient to hold them inspite of the negativity. Some did, but most gave up
2429 2018-03-10 14:10:00 I am the one who takes stocks.
2430 2018-03-10 14:09:29 Sick of your hatred toward Trump & his family. Americans know what you & your Fake Media aren't covering. His policies are working, increased jobs, lowered taxes, Winning with Isis, Controlled Rocket Man, Stocks up, making better deals for USA. Winning fight with the Swamp.
2431 2018-03-10 14:07:56 Remind me how bump stocks are legal AT ALL anywhere?
2432 2018-03-10 14:06:56 Your statement is not quite correct.  It does not spray bullets with a bump stock.  It just makes pulling the trigger for 2nd and subsequent fires easier to do.  Bump stocks lessen recoil impact.
2433 2018-03-10 14:06:48 No gun control announcements? Now would be a damn good time.

You had that televised WH meeting with lawmakers TEN days ago! 

Florida has already CHANGED laws since then.

How about you? Bump stocks? ANYTHING at all??

You said you weren't scared of the NRA. Prove it!

2439 2018-03-10 14:02:37 I am not sure if all the stocks listed are "quality" stocks. Given the no. of issues marring its very existence, Religare is a very, very dicey bet. Even, Responsive Industries' performance over the past 2 years has been poor.
2440 2018-03-10 14:01:57 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.  私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。１

2447 2018-03-10 13:59:01 It is truly sad. 7 years ago I looked at buying a home in the BH Flats for a lil over $3 mil, on Arden Dr. Now it’s $8 mil. Property taxes are insane and so are the taxpayers. I did better leaving my $ in stocks and saving the taxes. No needles there but lots of liberal waste.
2448 2018-03-10 13:57:39 I have come to the conclusion the she has no clue what the fuck she’s talking about “we need to get rid of the bump stocks, we need to get rid of those magazines." Just the way she said it gives it away.
2449 2018-03-10 13:57:16 He told me how his grandfather was multi millionaire working as an electrician when he died. All because he bought land and stocks.

2456 2018-03-10 13:54:01 Correct me if I’m wrong...the constitution gives Americans the right 2 bear arms-a right that cannot be infringed. It doesn’t guarantee the right 2 all high capacity accessories or bump-stocks? It doesn’t guarantee the right  2 ALL guns? It doesn’t guarantee an 18 yr. old can buy
2457 2018-03-10 13:53:50 Great !  You & Media are bias. Our highly successful President & his Administration has increased jobs for all, lowered taxes, Winning with Isis, Controlled Rocket Man, Stocks up, making better deals for USA. Winning fight with the Swamp.
2458 2018-03-10 13:53:22 So @Michelle777* has gone - seemed a decent enough lady, but with a penchant for dreadful stocks and an even worse choice of “associates”. Not too difficult to spot whose pocket she resided in.
2459 2018-03-10 13:53:15 guess everything is sometimes like stocks where ups and downs appear inturns
2460 2018-03-10 13:52:34 Trump has called for a ban on bump stocks. Obama was the one that approved them. So that would make AR once again a one bullet per trigger pull.
2461 2018-03-10 13:52:28 This is flawed logic, as TA has 100 interpretations and is not that accurate. FA is. So we need both but FA is king, as it is in stocks.
2462 2018-03-10 13:52:13 Fixed shares means UK & EU agree on how to divide stocks. Could be 90/10, 10/90, etc.

2474 2018-03-10 13:43:31 @bbcaq Getting our fishing rights back & protecting the fish stocks are not mutually exclusive.
2475 2018-03-10 13:41:28 Banks don’t pay to buy stocks but ready to fund real estate, individuals can leverage with this asset class
2476 2018-03-10 13:41:05 Amen to that Rohit. It's funny how we have a ton of analysts covering a handful of large cap stocks which have failed to move either way, are fully known to the investing public and really have nothing to investigate into!
2477 2018-03-10 13:40:57 It's also not good manner for anyone but in dip buy in dip and stocks correcting 30-50% from their high. You also saw this on screen. When market was 7400 level I was given the target of 10398 and 10780 and 11402 almost all achieved. When I was posted this target I explain there
2478 2018-03-10 13:40:05 You & Media make me sick.  You wont cover our highly successful President fairly. Trump Trump's Obama! He is Making America Great Again!

2482 2018-03-10 13:36:35 If our country spent as much time, money, & effort rounding up assault weapons, bump stocks,& high capacity magazines as ICE does anyone who looks like a brown immigrant, we might  finally be safer in our own schools, retirement homes, shopping malls, etc.
2483 2018-03-10 13:36:19 We failed under Wilson to manage our own stocks. Correct. (Wilson failed at everything) That doesn't mean we need them managed for us now.
EU fishing policy, throwback especially, is catastrophic in every respect.
No stocks of anything are a common resource for all.
2484 2018-03-10 13:36:00 Stocking of new fish started today as part of of continued commitment to maintain fish stocks. It goes hand in hand with our conservation work to improve the habitat on our waters .

2486 2018-03-10 13:34:45 Apparently this is the best they can do for now which is sad. Changing the age to buy assault rifles to 21 and banning Bump stocks is a joke and a huge let down by our politicians in favor of the NRA.
2487 2018-03-10 13:34:41 Gone through all those hoops with other weed stocks. Trying to be reactionary has cost me more often than not. Although I did avoid a $143K loss by dumping the whole portfolio just before the Senate went back in session. Had a feeling that the sector would fall.

2496 2018-03-10 13:24:28 @realDonaldTrump, stay out of the people’s process. If you EO any anti-2a legislation you are removing the public from the conversation! S.2475 is a totally ambiguous piece of legislation. You’d do well to get educated on the facts surrounding “bump stocks”

2497 2018-03-10 13:22:14 .@whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. You cannot "ban" illegals from obtaining anything.

It means selection of stock with sound promoters and potential business model also important
2522 2018-03-10 12:59:09 Lack of price discovery for small stocks due to very little volume/liquidity is a major problem.

Diff in buy/sell pressure due to time of day is a problem. Market with too many buyers or sellers doesn’t give a fair price for both parties.

2532 2018-03-10 12:52:37 Economy great! If you believe that, you believe the earth is flat & rectangular. Stocks powered higher. NASDAQ reached all time high. Next two weeks critical. Stocks have to go to new highs, or experience rapid crash of at least 40%. Is there enough credit to push stocks higher?

2546 2018-03-10 12:45:23 Bump stocks are for mass murderers. Plain and simple. This organization is for terrorists.
2547 2018-03-10 12:45:18 Although since 2nd week of Jan, portfolios have given back a lot, mostly in BTC and marijuana stocks, as a percentage of overall portfolios, even if they don't come back well, if other sectors do better, there is a good chance 2018 still can be a good profitable year.

2553 2018-03-10 12:40:20 Very clever hyperbole, as always, imaginarybar!  The NRA insists that bump stocks and assault/military type weapons are codified as part of the 2ndA.  I mean, these days a well organized militia should have nukes, right?  Just fighting fire power with fire power.....
2554 2018-03-10 12:40:02 Glue gun violence is everywhere

2555 2018-03-10 12:40:02 Love you Today Show - but you got this headline totally wrong - give FL credit for age increase, waiting period, eliminating bump stocks, etc. This is a BIG WIN with a minor controversy.
2556 2018-03-10 12:39:39 Actually... Under Obama it was 4% unemployment. There was some slowing initially under Trump and it looks like it is now 4.1% unemployment.
More companies are buying back stocks than hiring and more planned one time bonuses have been given than raises. Time though will tell.
2557 2018-03-10 12:39:13 I would question why I should buy stocks that insiders (that know more than me about the business) are happy to sell.
2558 2018-03-10 12:36:32 I vepřová hlava může být prezidentem.
2559 2018-03-10 12:35:44 That has nothing to do with overfishing shared stocks and what is being discussed. Still, the answer is relatively straightforward: whatever is agreed by both parties. Hell, the EU could pay for access if the EU fleet (without UK) wants to fish Norwegian waters.
2560 2018-03-10 12:31:15 Fixed shares means UK & EU agree on how to divide stocks. Could be 90/10 or 10/90. And let's stick to facts. The value of landings is going higher & higher. Industry profits are at a record high. You can argue about distribution (and I do), but that's a different (domestic) issue

2565 2018-03-10 12:25:31 Selon moi le mieux à faire est en effet les pré-commandes, c'est le plus sur pour l'artiste. Les stocks c'est le mal, n'importe quelle personne ayant étudié le marketing un minimum te le dira!
2566 2018-03-10 12:25:20 It is not necessary that all invested stocks will give good returns . 10 out of 15 may fail but 5 will give more then required . Invest only that amount which u can forget for 5-10 years. Always make habit to free capital . If u invest at 50 and price reaches 70. Book capital .

2569 2018-03-10 12:18:13 Absolutely. Indeed other more progressive cities r doing exactly that 2 sensibly balance + justify costs of maintenance of their urban tree stocks. Not here. Sadly @SheffCouncil regard them as a luxury #sheffieldissuper cant afford 2 keep and @Ameyplc r only 2 happy 2 benefit.
2570 2018-03-10 12:17:40 Agreed. Suspect Computer A talks to Computer B but who fed the info into computer A and what's the cost of that mistake? 

Costs we as a firm and tax payers carry.

Schools arent a sanctuary from guns I think, just the age limit
2656 2018-03-10 10:34:30 I understand what you're saying but once they take away our guns there is nothing to stop them from taking away other rights, they will fall like dominoes what's after bump stocks anything considered semi-automatic if they don't get this wall built soon election is over anyway

2669 2018-03-10 10:15:10 Flagships are a different issue. But regarding the distribution of quota for shared stocks there is absolutely room for improvement. However changes will need to be made in a way that doesn't threaten sustainability.

2678 2018-03-10 09:59:51 The key point here is that the UK has a much higher proportion of shared stocks than those other countries. The relatively few exclusive stocks we do have (shellfish) are already managed nationally (Nephrops being an exception)
2679 2018-03-10 09:58:19 Well good NFP and wage growth in limbo , plus trump backtracking on tariffs hence stocks surge again, just wondered how much Wall Street pressure applied to trump to reverse the much needed correction of the stock market...  seems suspicious !!  Not rocket science
2680 2018-03-10 09:55:37 Anybody counselling holding on to your stocks should first mention:

1. What are the triggers/factors etc that would lead to a Sell call?

2. How current pullback doesn’t satisfy those conditions?

Else the advice is just a bunch of motherhood statements that needs to be ignored

2692 2018-03-10 09:45:31 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

2697 2018-03-10 09:42:09 I understand. I’m not suggesting that people be relieved of their guns at all. I have 2 myself which I use at the gun range. But there has 2B a compromise somewhere. Waiting period, more stringent BG checks, eliminate high capacity magazines & bump stocks, worth a few lives?
2698 2018-03-10 09:42:07 Most icos are just unregistered/unregulated stocks. I don't see how zero regulation would have prevented a global financial crisis.

2700 2018-03-10 09:41:52 I'm not, but it actually doesn't matter. The stocks in question will continue to be shared post-Brexit. That should be recognised and acted upon.

2706 2018-03-10 09:36:43 I believe the providers report the data to HMRC? That's my understanding. They then make changes to tax code and collect through pension income.
2707 2018-03-10 09:33:44 But at the same time exclusive stocks for Iceland and Norway are in very good shape, I think you are avoiding the fact that it’s EU involvement that creates the problem.
2708 2018-03-10 09:32:59 You again axed your master(mind)'s foot! Properties of thrice jailed JShah, chargesheeted FTIL also attached. You are right - stocks got converted to those properties and they ought to be sold. EOW @CPMumbaiPolice & @dir_ed , liquidation is long overdue.

2711 2018-03-10 09:31:04 Okay, so let’s take notes here.  Florists did pass a gun bill, but very watered down.  While they did raise the minimum age to 21 and ban bump stocks, people can still by assault weapons.  Um what?!?! So when there’s another shooting are we going to do nothing again?
2712 2018-03-10 09:31:03 I can well imagine lots of undeclared tax...
2713 2018-03-10 09:29:32 That's basically it. Shared stocks outside of the EU framework fare worse as unilateral TACs (and even their possibility) leads to overfishing. I recommend that the UK seek fixed shares (say for a ten yr period) as fast as possible to prepare for Brexit.

2724 2018-03-10 09:17:17 Client can't ring HMRC herself.  Client had to obtain tax certificates from numerous providers, many who (oddly) didn't provide them as standard. HMRC then issued an invoice and subsequently 3 X tax codes in the space of 2 weeks.
2725 2018-03-10 09:16:33 Monkey Toast! They have a new term starting very soon. Plus Shoot From the Hip

2729 2018-03-10 09:08:31 Exclusive stocks or shared stocks? Shared stocks between Iceland, Norway, and the EU set quota further from ICES advice and few have reached MSY status. Shared stocks is the point I'm making and the one of relevance to the Brexit discussion.
2730 2018-03-10 09:06:32 Does this mean that investment companies will report fund interest too, without the need for the client to declare interest?
2731 2018-03-10 09:05:21 No rights to fish, we can issue licences and we must control to preserve and build our stocks. We can sell them fish that our fishermen catch too. This country should have all the benefits of leaving the EU, every single one.

2734 2018-03-10 09:03:52 Yes. It increased armed security in schools and bumped the age of the 21 for ownership. And it banned bump stocks. The NRA immediately filed a lawsuit because increasing the age to 21 is unconstitutional. I'm hoping to not see too many more of these incidences before we get a

2813 2018-03-10 07:55:33 The NRA deserves prosecution as a terrorist organization. Support for silencers, concealed carry nationwide, AR-15s & semiautomatics, bump stocks. What else do terrorists need?

2817 2018-03-10 07:50:57 Do you think they have a case? Just to be clear I support gun control but is it supported by your constitution? And why are they suing about the age rise but not bump stocks? I have so many questions.

2822 2018-03-10 07:40:24 these MM's are constantly shorting, constantly buying, and constantly reshorting. It is a never ending process on all OTC stocks. Today VERT showed no sign of short aggression though, it was all retail. To conclude on this, retail rarely shorts anything OTC, especially sub-penny.

2840 2018-03-10 07:15:50 The trick is not to learn to trust your gut feelings, but rather to discipline yourself to ignore them. Stand by your stocks as long as the fundamental story of the company hasn’t changed.

2850 2018-03-10 07:07:36 Absolutely correct. There is no fun of buying stocks when market is all time high that to when Nifty PE 26 or 27. Look at Buffet sitting on huge cash. Is he not trying to time the market? Or look at big HNI who bought KRBL recently & now share price has corrected more than 30%.

2868 2018-03-10 06:47:37 The NRA is now basically interested in people easily getting a big collection of guns in a very short amount of time, for anyone to use it. 

Bump stocks were designed for easier gun firing by those with poor hand control. They have been abused, and must be removed from sale.

Bump stocks are used to make any semi auto guns fully auto or increases the rate of fire dramatically which are still very much legal in the US but hopefully not for long.

2903 2018-03-10 05:54:43 I do support the NRA lawsuit, as well. I do think that bump stocks are likely to be banned given that they are only useful for spraying bullets and are wildly inaccurate. That said, I am adamantly opposed to further 2A restrictions. Let teachers be armed if they wish!
2904 2018-03-10 05:52:43 The stocks were magically transformed into Rs 8000 crores worth properties moron. Go get it. Why do an auction you claim it..

2906 2018-03-10 05:50:22 But at least it raises the age to buy assault weapons to 21 and bans bump stocks.

2913 2018-03-10 05:40:22 Don't forget it also bans the sale and possession of bump stocks. I watched a YouTube video explaining a bump stock, and while I think semi-automatic weapons should be banned also, seeing what a bump stock could do was shocking.
2914 2018-03-10 05:39:52 This has actually happened during every presidential term. Nothing new. Do you think the government doesn’t invest in military related stocks before we blow up brown people in foreign countries?
2915 2018-03-10 05:36:52 But cig stocks are easy money too. It’s just funny how we work. We know soda is bad but look what that has done for warren buffet.
2916 2018-03-10 05:35:08 So, didn’t @realDonaldTrump say bump stocks were going to be done this week?! Legislators didn’t even need to worry about them? He was getting rid of them by Executove Order! What happened to that? #NeverAgain

2920 2018-03-10 05:31:30 You can't buy a hand gun until you're 21. But it's ok to buy a weapon of war assault rifle and bump stocks at 18?
This is insane.
2921 2018-03-10 05:31:27 Sure, but you're moving the goalposts there. Discussion of the broader goals of gun policy doesn't require precise legal definitions of "assault weapon/assault rifle", as those are malleable, varying from state to state, and furthermore are made a mockery of by bump stocks.
2922 2018-03-10 05:29:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2923 2018-03-10 05:28:54 An analogy can be drawn for stocks :P
2924 2018-03-10 05:27:59 I always walk into the store and use my stocks and bonds too. 
2925 2018-03-10 05:24:23 Love how your charts don’t include 2016 onward. Every chart you look at has a steep incline or decline, whether it’s unemployment, US stocks, other economy. Obama did nothing but maintain. He was a maintainer. He destroyed the healthcare of America.

2930 2018-03-10 05:17:25 The need for bump stocks is very odd! I don't need an automatic weapon to hit any target. There must be a lot of lousy shots around!

2932 2018-03-10 05:17:13 No doubt, they not gone teach you about trading stocks, investments, multiple incomes and etc... It’s all in the books 
2933 2018-03-10 05:16:55 Wrong, many of us are mad that the NRA went weak on bump stocks.
2934 2018-03-10 05:14:42 Thanks for all the good info.  The driver for social media stocks is user growth. Also realizing a TAM that is basically unproven in A/R is probably reflected in the extremely high valuation.
2935 2018-03-10 05:14:36 With the presence of 3D printers, banning bump stocks will be just a futile as our war on drugs.
2936 2018-03-10 05:14:29 @jimcramer since there are no stupid questions are potable water  related stocks a long term investment in your opinion?   With south africa's water problems in the news and recent concerns in California is there opportunity in this area?
2937 2018-03-10 05:13:44 baseball boys tho 
2938 2018-03-10 05:12:01 i agree! bump stocks are BS! but i doubt bump stocks are why the NRA has so many paying members, i think it has more to do with general uncertainty of the future of gun ownership. let’s make the argument something their constituents can’t disagree with

2940 2018-03-10 05:10:05 Please tell that to shareholders.... JAKKS Toys stocks plummeted due to bankruptcy concerns of Toys-R-Us.
2941 2018-03-10 05:09:23 Even minimal steps like banning bump stocks are being opposed by legal action from the NRA! They are not interested in sensible solutions; they are blanket opposed to any anti-gun legislation and it's unconscionable that anyone supports them.

2943 2018-03-10 05:07:18 U dont get update of ur real state prices whereas stocks show Price fluctuations every mili seconds. Secondary from real estate is very long term asset for most ppl, they stay in it or get the rent from it. Also ppl have clarity in real estate and not in equity
2944 2018-03-10 05:07:06 The offer lasts until the stocks lasts with the seller, request you to check out as soon as the product is added to cart. Request your understanding.
2945 2018-03-10 05:05:47 We always think of malpractice when we hear such news. Without ruling out malpractice by some or some malpractice by all could it be that most of such wealth are invested in stocks and stock market itself grew around 39% in last year?
2946 2018-03-10 05:04:33 Oh good job, you found a video of a world champion shooter. Still doesn't show how bump stocks are faster than full auto.
2947 2018-03-10 05:03:54 I didnt have anything saved but then my Nana & dad died within a yr of eachother & left me with 3.5 million.

2952 2018-03-10 05:01:30 that's not what liberals like me want we don't want our kids shot up in schools we don't want bump stocks used to Massacre concert-goers we want something that makes sense there can't be an absolute no 2nd Amendment but there has to be give & take on both sides, the NRA?= Sux
2953 2018-03-10 04:59:45 Why so laser focused on guns? What kind of paranoia leads a person to fight universal background checks, banning bump stocks, and letting terrorists on watchlists be able to buy guns? What are you fighting so hard for? Terrorist?

2958 2018-03-10 04:53:47 I didn't say they were not needed I said they were irrelevant to someone who actually trains and knows the manual of arms for a semi-automatic rifle. Bump stocks are just pieces of plastic usually.

2961 2018-03-10 04:52:19 @POTUS .@whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more-using the argument they also “accelerate” the fire of a gun. Instead, please insist on clean carry reciprocity .

2970 2018-03-10 04:45:46 Typical overreaction, this is why Main Street sells their stocks at the slightest whiff of trouble, 6 months ago everyone told me a war with North Korea was inevitable. I’m not saying it can’t happen, but people are so quick to jump the gun these days.
2971 2018-03-10 04:45:00 We usually will have stocks available at our Collection Locations.
2972 2018-03-10 04:44:15 You know, people can own stocks and actually disallow the banks from defrauding citizens.
2973 2018-03-10 04:43:00 No. Key elements of the bill:
- Raise min age to purchase guns to 21 yrs 
- Impose 72 hr waiting period for most guns
- Ban on sale or possession of bump stocks
- Up to $67m to train some school workers to carry guns but excluding most teachers
2974 2018-03-10 04:42:08 they all get paid to bring those so called "research analysts" on TV to pump and dump the stocks. If any stock go either way as per their recommendation, nobody is gonna put bullet on their head. So they are criminals on TV, there is huge nexus

2984 2018-03-10 04:32:18 If owning #stocks is a long-term project for you, following their changes  constantly is the worst possible thing you can do, because people are so sensitive to #short-term losses. If you  count your money every day, you’ll be #miserable #investing #etf #trading
2985 2018-03-10 04:32:16 Our sprinting stocks are looking  good Redzel , Redkirk Warrior, Brave Smash and Merchant Navy were all very good today
2986 2018-03-10 04:32:06 OK we all think it’s great FL raising the gun age 18to21 they addressed bump stocks with a no they didn’t address assault weapons.   Why is age 21 the magic number?? I know the basic answer, I’ve really been bugged by this,instead of jumping for joy ...
2987 2018-03-10 04:31:54 Lol the trump things with the due process later?? Lmao he’s a tool that was to make gun sales  go up cuz the gun company stocks went down after this last shooting so wat better way to create revenue by scaring ppl lmao oldest trick
2988 2018-03-10 04:31:43 funny when the indicators of the economy was ticking up for Obama. Trump said it was fake news. so now we are suppose to kiss his azz. trump didn't do shit but make his family rich. half of america don't own stocks just some more money for the 1%
2989 2018-03-10 04:31:19 Orlando victims were mostly the bungling Swat team who were shooting in the dark through walls. You should read the court report on that. Vegas was a guy that collected guns as if they were toys & he fitted bump stocks also. But there has been more deadly shootings in 30yrs
2990 2018-03-10 04:30:30 Ana, it’s not all or nothing. Yes, great that NRA opposes the age 21 provision. & there r a few other + things in the bill (eg banning bump stocks). But arming teachers & staff?  WRONG.  Refusing to ban assault rifles?  A travesty. Let’s have a balanced assessment of the details.
2991 2018-03-10 04:30:27 I agree with extra background checks, longer wait periods and no bump stocks. But not allowing a person to buy a gun until they are 21 is ridiculous. What about hunting rifles and hand guns for protection? There were other things that could have been done!

2997 2018-03-10 04:25:00 Although, if you wish to be pedantic, I would offer that bump stocks simulate full auto effectively enough in terms of rate of fire. And yes, I know exactly how they work. We must get assault rifles out of civilian hands. Enough deaths!
2998 2018-03-10 04:23:10 These stocks were fundamentally sound in past

3017 2018-03-10 04:04:46 So true.

3034 2018-03-10 03:55:11 It's absurd how much pushback there is on bump stock bans.  They're not even popular accessories and every single gun owner that's used one will tell you they are fun but actually suck for anything useful.  Nobody is in love with bump stocks and yet
3035 2018-03-10 03:54:46 Really need to look to see if it exists but would love to see a study of returns for “retail investor heavy” stocks vs the more “obscure” ones.

3043 2018-03-10 03:47:04 Here's an idea.  The same way police departments organize the ridiculous "gun buybacks", they can take from now to Oct bump stocks and offer a $100 gift card.  That way the owners have a chance to be compensated.

3047 2018-03-10 03:44:30 So Mew wanted #Pringles. This is the 1st time he’s had any in 3yrs. In this time they’ve ceased exporting from the US & are now made/packed/exported from Malaysia. The tube is smaller & the chips are smaller, at a higher price. No wonder the shop hardly stocks them. Total rip off

3053 2018-03-10 03:39:10 Getting into stocks and trading beyond my 401k. Additional income on a long term scale. Not looking to get rich quick.
3054 2018-03-10 03:38:11 Repeal the 2A would be fantastic, but I don’t think that will happen. Baby steps. Let’s start w some of the basics; no more AR-15’s and other similar guns, no more bump stocks, and no more private sales. Raising the age and better background checks would help too. 
3055 2018-03-10 03:37:59 thanks mark youre always there for your readers and clients, i appreciate your perspective..aside from american stocks performed horribly - chinese guys have RAN for past 10 years nonstop! please tell me which chinese stocks do you like..im tired of usa reverse split stocks

3065 2018-03-10 03:30:07 I would have no problem revisiting the 1st Amendment to see if it needs an update. Again, 276 years. Pre-internet. Pre-high tech. Pre-AR-15’s and bump stocks. Pre-a whole lot of things. Today’s world is not what the 2nd Amend was written for.
3066 2018-03-10 03:28:59 thx @charliebilello So stocks got the money. Next 5 years, likely less so. #BakesTakes_
3067 2018-03-10 03:28:45 as in True Market Leaders were leading & making new highs BEFORE the indexes & even during index volatility.  2.  the market easily absorbed the news about Cohn & Tariffs & shook it off  3.  Jobs report  4.  more & more stocks are setting up, breaking out, and holding their b/o's
3068 2018-03-10 03:27:38 I understand your logic. I would actually make it 25. Considering, car insurers feel that's the mature age for drivers. They typically pass laws that they feel were at fault from the last incident(bump stocks and age requirement/backround check). It's the comprise for both sides
3069 2018-03-10 03:27:06 that was so intentional. call that foul

3076 2018-03-10 03:18:53 $MDXG It is NOT prudent for investors to follow one person who is obsessed with one stock. Diversification of a portfolio is the best way to minimize risk. Seems like they would be discussing other stocks in their portfolios. There is  an opportunity cost to this obsession. edit
3077 2018-03-10 03:18:49 A drop-in auto sear and lighting link can both do the same thing. Both were explicitly created to illegally modify semiautomatics to go full auto. Bump stocks were created for this purpose and this purpose alone. They thus need to be as illegal as the aforementioned accessories.
3078 2018-03-10 03:17:16 2018-2022. I feel it’s guna be a good 4 years 

1. silver- because it’s cheap AF relative to everything else
2. cash- to trade with, especially with the oncoming forex volatility 
3. crypto- because it’ll be the last bubble to pop the everything bubble(stocks, property, bonds)

3080 2018-03-10 03:15:59 So bump stocks have never been involved in a violent crime?

Why are we making policy based solely on just the words of lying assholes?

3081 2018-03-10 03:14:42 They don’t care if you blow all your money at a casino,  so why the qualified investor for ICO??    I can also dump all my money on bad stocks no one cares... but we’re protecting you on ICO’s ...

3084 2018-03-10 03:12:06 It doesn't ban any specific weapons as far as I can see. It does ban bump stocks. The scary part is that now in Florida your due process rights are gone.Basically they can take your guns if  a LEO subjectively decides that you're unstable. No adjudication or other proof is needed
3085 2018-03-10 03:12:02 Did you already forget when Trump proposed banning bump stocks?
3086 2018-03-10 03:11:58 ... closed my foreign corporation  all that should be explained in my pinned tweet. Stocks are in a eay easier, but in a way harder. I do make more in stocks right now than forex but forex is my love, I am better at it And trades are easier to work out of, if wrong.
3087 2018-03-10 03:10:57 Amazing the differences between stocks.

3090 2018-03-10 03:09:48 @FLGovScott 
You signed a bill changing the age from 18 to 21 to buy a gun. You made bump stocks illegal. That is all great.
Why have you not banned semi automatic weapons? The kind of gun used to kill 17 people (kids) in your state?
3091 2018-03-10 03:08:49 @marcorubio grown adults thinking that PLAYING with guns is more important than trying to instill some simple rules & guidelines of safety like age increase, ban bump stocks, mental wellness.  Why do we have tell adults... enough!

3095 2018-03-10 03:04:13 3-@realDonaldTrump America and its allies overthrown Saddam Hussein because they believed that Iraq had stocks of chemical weapons. On the other hand,they couldn't find one reason to stop Bashar AlAssad from doing more bloodshed? And they couldn't see the use of chemical weapons?
3096 2018-03-10 03:03:59 Yes!!! Pretending that banning bump stocks and raising the legal age to 21 is significant.... no, it’s is the very least that can be done.

3100 2018-03-10 03:03:08 Florida legislature sends gun safety bill to the governor.  It bans bump stocks, mandatory waiting period, imposes a minimum age of 21, and mental health assistance in schools. steps in the right direction.
3101 2018-03-10 02:58:46 It's sarcasm ppl  high beta are highly volatile stocks/coins. I don't agree but I had a good laugh  We're all in the same fish bowl, pale

3113 2018-03-10 02:52:16 We all know those wipes don’t stay with one kid.  When the stocks are low or parents don’t replenish, they use other kids’ wipes. I’d check with all the kids’ parents to see if another child was affected...

3115 2018-03-10 02:51:18 But you all know they're in the market and loving how their own stocks and 401K has greatly increased in value since @POTUS was elected. @EricTrump
3116 2018-03-10 02:49:53 Pro tip: each fund in the plan has a symbol. Go to the company's website and there is a link to "all holdings". Search for gun manufacturers. Also BlackRock is in the process of eliminating all gun stocks from its funds.

3121 2018-03-10 02:48:15 Agree. They really have no case. Seems they’re attempting 2 use intimidation? Scott’s ruling would also ban the damn bump stocks, but NRA is ok with bump stocks? A Fing device that has 1 purpose only, 2 convert a semi -auto in2 an illegal deadly full auto? NRA are pure evil.
3122 2018-03-10 02:46:07 @davidhogg111 since neither of you are Economists you may want to chill. Stocks are going straight up (still). We all economists getting rich off of it. Plus listening to a SEAL like @mchooyah may teach you how the world really works (not how it works in American fantasy land)
3123 2018-03-10 02:46:07 Defensive play is very heavily rewarded, and 2 stocks is asking for trouble. They can eliminate 2 stock rulings by nerfing recoveries, the blastzones, or the ledge, any will do to warrant 3 stocks again

3127 2018-03-10 02:44:46 The Government can regulate which arms you can purchase. A nuclear weapon is a arm you cannot purchase one. At 18 or 100 try to get a nuke.  You don't need bump stocks or semi automatic weapons.  The 2nd Amendment does not guarantee you the right to certain weapons.
3128 2018-03-10 02:44:12 What a busy week in #MDGA18 and it ended great! This afternoon we passed the ban on bump stocks out of Judiciary and Dream Act expansion out of Ways and Means!
3129 2018-03-10 02:41:23 Absolutely agree that the next inflation wave will come from China. I'll stick to gold stocks gold silver. No RMB bonds thanks.
3130 2018-03-10 02:41:07 Please stick to the topic at hand, this has nothing to do with stocks. Although, the notorious "Make America Great Again" slogan clearly explains that he wants to revert this nation back to approximately the 1800's, the slavery age.

3134 2018-03-10 02:39:57 Dana Loesch said what she did, thinking nothing would be changed. The excerpt speaks about age, but I think FL also banned bump stocks. And you know Marion Hammer (?) is throwing a fit about all of it.
3135 2018-03-10 02:39:14 Also bump stocks were not used in the Parkland murders and raising the age to purchase will change nothing so long as these weapons remain available.

3161 2018-03-10 02:13:38 I imagine the process of moving to different stock requires lots of test prints and various downstream business decisions related to the printers.

It would even probably have an impact on the art department since different stocks have different properties, glossiness, etc.

3167 2018-03-10 02:08:21 @KyleKashuv what do you think about the recently passed Florida gun bill?

Here's what's in it that I disagree with:

■ Raise age to purchase gun to 21 from 18

■ Require 3-day waiting period for gun purchases

■ Ban the sale or possession of bump stocks
3168 2018-03-10 02:07:08 This isn’t compromise. This is placating the protesters. If it were compromise we’d have a minimum purchase age and a ban on bump stocks. #BlueWave2018
3169 2018-03-10 02:06:56 Florida's new #GunControl is a JOKE. 3 day waiting period? Age raised to 21? Banning bump stocks only? This gun control is an insult to intelligent people. Every shooter (with the exception of Sandy Hook) was over 21. AR-15 is just as deadly without bump stock. Of course NRA
3170 2018-03-10 02:04:18 類語編：「急に減る・下がる」
・plummet：「急落・暴落」の意。名詞と動詞の両方で使われ、アクセント位置同じ。Stocks have plummeted this quarter（この四半期で株価が暴落した）。

3175 2018-03-10 02:00:48 Going bankrupt due to unforeseen health circumstance is our biggest nightmare. The AHCA was there to prevent this situation. Remember you qualify for Medicaid bc you're in an extremely low income bracket. You don't have stocks, bonds or a 401(k).The sick who can't afford care die
3176 2018-03-10 02:00:40 What millions of jobs? Trump has caused tourism to suffer costing jobs! The tariffs will cost jobs! The companies are using the tax cuts to buyback stocks and cut jobs!  You do know the travel ban was knocked down right? What VA reform?
3177 2018-03-10 01:59:30 Reports that the Mexican owned Univision Spanish TV network is in dire stress and even stocks are not been sold and thousands of employees let go, this is one of the networks that took Trump head on with reporter Jorge Ramos in the front leading the charge against President Trump

3179 2018-03-10 01:59:17 Let's just hope that for glory has 3 stocks this time
3180 2018-03-10 01:59:15 8 years of stagnation, never much over 2% GDP. First year of Trump, 4%, stocks are at an all record high, business will thrive with his policies. When the private sector thrives, America thrives. Ya, thanks Obama lol!!!
3181 2018-03-10 01:59:02 I am normally trading stocks from 0.10-5.00 long and short. Although today I short some stocks higher than 5. Also I am trading pinksheet from 0.0001- 0.10  my exchanges for now are Nasdaq/AMEX  less noise.
3182 2018-03-10 01:58:52 Today would be a good day for @TIAA to divest gun stocks. #NeverAgain #TeachersAndGunsDontMix #teachers #nrasucks
3183 2018-03-10 01:58:25 What about bump stocks? What about ARs?
3184 2018-03-10 01:56:54 Can't buy a friggin hand gun until you're 21 but ppl can buy a weapon of war assault rifle and bump stocks at 18?? JFC!
3185 2018-03-10 01:56:19 Now I can combine pre market scanner and ER stocks
3186 2018-03-10 01:56:02 Ahh interesting!
What is your fave pattern these days? I usually trade stocks 20 and up but i know u r the queen of the smaller caps, always banking!
3187 2018-03-10 01:55:44 If you invest millions in stocks, an executive will get a nice jet. If you invest millions in Bitcoin, you may get a nice jet!
3188 2018-03-10 01:53:53 Bitcoin is not an investment in the same way that stocks are an investment. It might be a better asset. 

Bitcoin has a higher lifetime total return since it's launch that the S&P 500 during the same time period.

Plus, with Bitcoin, you don't have to pay executives millions!
3189 2018-03-10 01:53:01 Penny stocks!

3191 2018-03-10 01:51:18 Of course, Finviz has an option where you get all the stocks that are releasing ER next day with those stocks you can study in advance  which stocks has 
technical pattern or technical breakout.
3192 2018-03-10 01:48:29 Doesn't mean much, was a good day for most stocks after stong jobs report released. Hang on & wait til @amazon releases next quarters earnings report, that'll show if their revenue went down. THEN see what happens w/their stock. Ppl just nd to continue to #BoycottAmazon
3193 2018-03-10 01:44:57 Need to invest some change in these #MedicalMarijuana stocks
3194 2018-03-10 01:43:44 I'm glad the bill makes some improvements like banning bump stocks, and raising age to purchase shotguns and rifles to 21. Here’s what it doesn’t do: expand background checks, ban assault weapons, or enact a real extreme risk law. #NotEnough
3195 2018-03-10 01:43:14 Two bubbles I learned about today:

1. The 1969 “Poseidon bubble” in  Australian mining stocks. 

2. The 2001 palladium bubble. It’s surprisingly difficult to find any information about it...

3196 2018-03-10 01:43:11 Bump stocks if you tell a lie get it straight
3197 2018-03-10 01:42:59 Totally agree...if you see you tube videos of mohnish @MohnishPabrai mentions  that there are many stocks that fell after Monish entered.....this according to a certain author ( as mentioned by mohnish) is called pre accumulation....
3198 2018-03-10 01:42:51 That helps me how? I'm not wealthy enough to own stocks.
3199 2018-03-10 01:40:59 Yachty new album is NOTHING but slaps, do not @ me  nigga said “fuck that lil bih out her socks. Teachin’ this stripper ‘bout stocks.”

3201 2018-03-10 01:39:25 In 11/16, I advised selling USA stocks on Trump election because of the day.
3202 2018-03-10 01:39:15 Nice week for stocks. So many movers. $INDU-lagging might give room for higher for the likes of $Cat, de, lea, shw, Fdx, mmm, LLL. The market is a little overbought here but still looks higher. Trade your setups.
3203 2018-03-10 01:38:39 Subscribe to "IGottaMakeIt" on YouTube. He literally dumbs down everything to make it easier to understand, has a shit ton of videos on trading, penny stocks, etc. His videos are animated as well.
3204 2018-03-10 01:37:32 Why not spell out the limitation that banning the bump stocks would put in place, so there's not a new *whatever* that replaces it?
3205 2018-03-10 01:36:06 Maria Bartiromo,are you that dumb! Almost all steel Mills are shut down,and aluminum. That's a national security risk,so is selling qualcom to a China backed company. Almost all precious metals for mother boards are china. How near sighted are you,a fools folly! Stocks vs USA !
3206 2018-03-10 01:35:56 I met with a retirement advisor and I got to give the okay to liquidate a bunch of my stocks in my 401k and it felt amazing
3207 2018-03-10 01:33:24 Don't stop your SIPs in Mutual funds or Stocks, only because Markets are in pressure.

Most returns in SIP come, when you invest in such situations.

3210 2018-03-10 01:31:21 for better or worse.... I liquidated some stock and reinvested in money markets, l9ng and short term bonds, precious metals, lithium and only kept large cap american and international stocks.

We are not trying to take away your right to bear arms

We are not trying to take away your right to bear arms

BUT we do demand a ban on semi-automatics, bump stocks, & high capacity magazines! Who's with me?
3212 2018-03-10 01:29:32 Trading stocks is not difficult unless your heart is truly in it. It gets tiring watching the numbers like a fucking hawk.
3213 2018-03-10 01:29:13 @maddow Please acknowledge receipt of this tweet I am also a veteran that have very small investments and I bit the dirt On that steel deal when stocks took a dump. It is very unfair for his friend to profit an “we the people” cont’ to lose.

3216 2018-03-10 01:26:16 Oh he really put it to the nra.   In the end they can still sell all the same weapons minus bump stocks.  Tax payers are forced to pay for arming school teachers.
3217 2018-03-10 01:25:48 So yourna mind reader? Clairvoyant? Why did liberal Obama let bump stocks legal but the guy who doesn't care will ban them in the next week? You have to understand the liberals feeding u info don't care about protecting children you're only tools for gun control

3219 2018-03-10 01:23:27 Everyone including the EU & even Mark Carney agrees, fishstocks are overfished & in severe danger. Now is the time for us to take control of our fishing waters & protect our fish stocks. No sellout. No deals on access. @PhilipHammondUK can do one! @fishingforleave
3220 2018-03-10 01:23:15 Just raising the minimum age and banning bump stocks isn’t gun control. It’s a start but there’s so much more to be done before we can call it “gun control”
3221 2018-03-10 01:23:14 @realDonaldTrump  Mr President please do not open gun control for future pre with exc order on bump stocks
3222 2018-03-10 01:22:49 Thank you. This is terrible. No grandfather clause for Bump Stocks. I am a felon, with bags of cocaine basically in my gun cabinet now.
3223 2018-03-10 01:22:45 I hate people who get into stocks for all the wrong reasons. It’s a marathon not a sprint!
3224 2018-03-10 01:22:02 i hope for the next comeback, Bighit stocks over a hundred copies for the next album and the retailers ship it on time, we can honestly be #1 in Billboard200 if that happens i swear
3225 2018-03-10 01:21:56 they also said they were ok with doing away with bump stocks
3226 2018-03-10 01:21:27 Raised age to 21, ban bump stocks, allowed teachers to carry if both school & local governments agree, allow guns to be removed from people deemed unsafe/mentally unfit. Common sense stuff. Still no assault rifle ban. good compromise
3227 2018-03-10 01:20:58 No one can answer this question:

Where is the evidence of bump stocks being a threat to public safety other than the word of the FBI and Clark County Sheriff who were caught too many times lying about the facts of the #LasVegasShooting ?

Base #2A #GunControl on their word?
3228 2018-03-10 01:20:25 I kind of wanted @PG_Plup to die a 5th time in that game 1 so he could have lost more of @MVG_Mew2King's stocks than M2K would've.
3229 2018-03-10 01:20:12 @realDonaldTrump Large and mid-cap stocks 4X overpriced per historical measures for an economy in the toilet. Small caps are 6-8X overpriced! Short selling small caps is the best investment you can make. PE of 150 for the Russell 2000 !!

I know a lot of crypto-twitter hate stocks but it’s good to get balance.
3236 2018-03-10 01:17:46 I’m for banning bump stocks and arming school administrators and teachers, but remember you took an oath to support and defend the constitution. Explain why you’re not a sellout.
3237 2018-03-10 01:17:16 Done buying sneakers, I’ve been buying stocks

3239 2018-03-10 01:16:40 What is going to happen to our jobs in the steel industry when everybody wants to be our friend all over sudden and chinese steel in routed into the US via Canada?  The deep dive of the steel stocks yesterday and today is a bad omen.
3240 2018-03-10 01:16:11 Sir what broker do you for US stocks? Thanks po.
3241 2018-03-10 01:15:59 so @NRA is SUING Florida for doing the right thing against gun violence? ya know, like raising the age, banning bump stocks, things that shoulda happened years ago.... so are we gonna start suing everyone that does the right thing nowadays....? okay, watch out y’all.
3242 2018-03-10 01:15:31 a lot of people are proud of their real estate, cryptocurrency, stocks and bonds but i paid $40 for my bong and it's been going strong for 12 years. best investment i ever made
3243 2018-03-10 01:14:13 You also said you'd release your taxes and meet with Robert Mueller. You also said you were stopping trophy hunting, banning gun stocks, and building a wall. You do nothing.
3244 2018-03-10 01:14:13 Thank you sir  it’s simple! 

It’s only #TheTruth 
3245 2018-03-10 01:12:42 That's a fox news lie. There's currently $2.3 trillion in the SS fund.   SS does not take in $2.3 trillion & pay out $2.3 trillion yearly.  Ryan & the GOP want to privatize SS to be traded on the stock market & profit from it. What happens when the price of the stocks drop? Oops!
3246 2018-03-10 01:12:07 What is #InternetBillofRights
Privacy? Yes,but more import. data mining protection.Imagine you could know what stocks and bonds to buy or sell hours or minutes before their value changes.What is trending and popular? Think about it! Google/U-Tube/Twitter/Facebook @realDonaldTrump
3247 2018-03-10 01:12:00 Jeff, have you seen how cheap the public private equity stocks are right now?  Right up your alley looking for value.
3248 2018-03-10 01:11:15 Wow really . Brand development for a famous product. Even my little daughter knows that pot stocks are skyrocketing  and they discuss in the middle school
3249 2018-03-10 01:11:00 Why only bump stocks?
3250 2018-03-10 01:10:40 No available stocks.
3251 2018-03-10 01:09:17 I don’t think the fed owns public stocks. They do however affect liquidity by buying or selling treasury notes, bonds, bills and in certain cases asset backed securities.

3253 2018-03-10 01:08:01 This is way too little way too late, and banning bump stocks in Florida doesn't mean shit since they can just drive up to Georgia and get them. Without taking the assault weapons they haven't done shit and they know it, just more deflection from the republicans
3254 2018-03-10 01:07:47 Thank you  I’m doing it for all of us! This is not about me at all.

3269 2018-03-10 00:58:01 So what part of the bill didn t u like the 3 day waiting period bump stocks? What?
3270 2018-03-10 00:57:57 Senate Bill 7026 also: 1) bans bump stocks and 2) arms teachers

What it doesn’t do: ban assault rifles
3271 2018-03-10 00:56:15 For a split second #ADSK stocks reached $140 today. That's a new record.
3272 2018-03-10 00:55:21 Sickens me to see you use “#VegasStrong” when you’ve done NOTHING to stop the massacre of people by those using assault-like weapons and bump stocks. You have the privilege of being our representative and you chose to do nothing but cower to the NRA
3273 2018-03-10 00:55:01 @50StatesOfBlue

3284 2018-03-10 00:50:09 Not all speech is protected. Maybe some guns, magazines, bump stocks shouldn't be protected either. Maybe since specific gun laws aren't common law it should be up to the states to interpret, per the Constitution

3286 2018-03-10 00:49:01 High savings offer margin of safety for unpredictable future returns. In stocks, it is quality and price. In personal finance, it is always savings.
3287 2018-03-10 00:48:42 To hunt many humans at once. Why do we need high capacity mags? So we can kill more humans at once. Why do we now need bump stocks? So we can wipe out what could be an entire town in under 20 minutes, hopefully they'll all be in the same church, wait...
3288 2018-03-10 00:48:19 For all those American's in the bottom income quintiles, there's no need to worry. The Trump family, @FoxNews, and the @GOP say the economy is great therefore everything is awesome in the U.S.  
Of course you probably own no stocks, real estate and have no retirement or savings.
3289 2018-03-10 00:47:47 You said if banning illegals saves one life, that's one life saved...same with banning assault weapons, and bump stocks, which aren't even in the Constitution...the Constitution is actually really only about single-shot muskets.  Maybe we should just go back to those.

3293 2018-03-10 00:44:43 They are proposing solutions: stricter background checks, accessible and maintained database, restricting violent offenders and mentally ill, age minimums, banning of assault/military grade riffles, and banning of bump stocks. Protesting and legislation is the method.
3294 2018-03-10 00:43:24 Disney owns ABC I believe... the stocks will be going down fast. Boycotts work well.
3295 2018-03-10 00:42:52 Are they opposed to the age limit, the bump-stocks or both? I've seen a lot about them being against the raising of the age (which I for the record support) but nothing about them being opposed to a ban on bump-stocks and similar devices?
3296 2018-03-10 00:42:29 Florida has a right to put the age from 18 years old to 21 years old on guns sales and as a state they should be able to impose a three day waiting period on assault weapons 

They should be able to ban bump stocks too
3297 2018-03-10 00:41:00 Where is your husband's promised executive order banning bump stocks.  He said he would do it quickly.  #LiarAndChief #GunControl
3298 2018-03-10 00:40:18 Canvassed by 8th graders on the street today, collecting petitions for gun control. Their knowledge of bump stocks, etc was heartbreaking but their activism inspiring.

3302 2018-03-10 00:37:53 To be fair to them, the history of industrial fishing has been of constant over-fishing. Fish stocks have only recovered during major wars. The EU however hamfistedly was managing it in peacetime.

3313 2018-03-10 00:30:50 Jim Cramer gives a fresh perspective on what could be causing defense stocks to fall recently.
3314 2018-03-10 00:30:45 I met a fiiiiooonnnne gentleman today and he was so humble. Our conversation was based on investment and stocks.
3315 2018-03-10 00:28:20  it’s like listening to Jim Cramer for stocks.
3316 2018-03-10 00:27:42 My other headers were $10. I've worked with tons of clients. And it's not just stocks, 1/2 of them were made by me. I used 2 stocks form Mixo's pack and the rest were brush strokes that were edited. I should have made a speedart..
3317 2018-03-10 00:27:24 I'd  rather be a market maker in options on penny stocks
3318 2018-03-10 00:27:22 The 401k & stocks have done well after @Obama's 8 years of undoing @bushofficial messes!  ALWAYS a disaster with #GOP in the #WhiteHouse.  Save those dollars as #GOP #tariffs & everything they do will cost u more.  Where's that wall #Trump promised? Sucker!!
3319 2018-03-10 00:27:08 my body is aching so bad after doin stocks the whole day ytd wshisuqnqiwjwkqjs
3320 2018-03-10 00:26:38 Actually, the waiting period will have the most impact, as most suicides are impulsive, as are *many* shootings which are done in anger. It will save many lives. Bump stocks were also banned.
3321 2018-03-10 00:26:20 Good thing you banned bump stocks because that rate of fire increase is bad. Wait a minute; I can still buy a machine gun if I filed the paperwork.  Another day, another dumb law. Some things never change.
3322 2018-03-10 00:25:52 "New law raises minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21, bans sale/possession of bump stocks, gives law enforcement greater power to seize weapons & ammo from mentally unfit, & provides funding for armed school officers."

@NRA Which one of these threatens law abiding gun owners?
3323 2018-03-10 00:25:36 That is just stocks and lighting if that takes you 6 hours bro and your charging that much you need to take time by yourself and work at your own work. You’re way to early to start charging especially that much!
3324 2018-03-10 00:25:24 President Obama legalized bump stocks and the NRA has no problem with making them illegal!
3325 2018-03-10 00:24:07 @IcelandFoods when will the north east stores have stocks of the boxes of Mini Vienna in again? South shields store never has any in lately.  They are lush, they need more stock! 
3326 2018-03-10 00:23:59 Glad @FLGovScott signed this new gun law. It makes some improvements like banning bump stocks, and raising age to purchase shotguns and rifles to 21. Here’s what it doesn’t do: expand background checks, ban assault weapons, or enact a real extreme risk law. #NotEnough

3343 2018-03-10 00:15:00 Stocks rose on Friday as investors cheered a stronger-than-expected jobs report and shrugged off President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum, which weren't as stringent as some had feared.
3344 2018-03-10 00:14:48 Banning bump-stocks is as stupid & as ‘Red Herring’ as arming teachers. How any of these hair brained ideas get media time is as beyond reason, as allowing semi/or fully automatic weapons AT ALL! It’s 2018. & hand guns r in fact US’s #1 problem by far, but don’t get 1 mention
3345 2018-03-10 00:13:11 @realDonaldTrump when will you denounce the @NRA for filing a lawsuit against the state of Florida.............because if you dont, its clear you are their slave.  Its pretty clear too you are already as I dont see a bump stocks EO anywhere but you have plenty time to retweet.
3346 2018-03-10 00:13:08 You may be happy to have income from your stocks related to the military industrial complex, but the people in Yemen, etc, are being killed for coin in your pocket, and it's despicable.
3347 2018-03-10 00:12:53 Ya but properly regulated guns would have prevented so many from dying. For example why do people need bump stocks. Why do people need massive amounts of ammunition why did the Vegas shooter have military grade bullets.

3359 2018-03-10 00:03:09 How about to fix a trade deficit, we force a capital deficit? The government basically says you have to invest >50% of your investments outside of the US. All the US stocks would drop, motivating foreign investors to buy American goods instead. It'd be a trade miracle!
3360 2018-03-10 00:03:09 @cvpayne what do you think? I bought some US Steel & Steel Dynamic stocks this week, good or bad move?

3364 2018-03-09 23:58:47 Good job by FL Gov. Rick Scott for signing new gun bill.

Bans bump stocks
Gives police more authority to confiscate weapons

3409 2018-03-09 23:35:53 You did better than that.  Don’t stop now, keep striving.  There are big things to come.
3410 2018-03-09 23:35:47 @JennRavenna I like the Epson Workforce 7510. tabloid sized scanner, pretty high end print quality, can handle card stocks.
3411 2018-03-09 23:35:30 Gov rick Scott said his new law to raise age limit and ban bump stocks will fix the assault weapons issue
3412 2018-03-09 23:35:08 Large cap stocks have liquidity premium. That means returns are less than small caps. What trades at a premium returns less-otherwise no one will buy illiquid assets. In real estate, Manhattan condos are more liquid than other NYC condos, and returns are therefore less.
3413 2018-03-09 23:34:21 t’s not video games
It’s not age restrictions 
It’s not mental health
It’s not background checks
It’s not bump stocks
IT’S AUTOMATIC WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF CITIZENS 
BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS NOW
3414 2018-03-09 23:34:21 are you feeling anxious before entering a trade then write it down and figure out why are you feeling that way and find a way to change that feeling. Beware of your emotions is one step that you need to take in order to be a successful trader. #daytrading #trader #trading #stocks
3415 2018-03-09 23:33:06 Bad time to invest in stocks doing great like AMZN, Shopify, Netflix? via /r/Stock_Picks

Would it be a bad time to invest since they’re already so high? Did I miss my chance a year ago? Thanks in advance. Looking for short and long term
3416 2018-03-09 23:32:59 It means they don’t understand the first thing about cryptocurrencies, they think it works like regular stocks. And you will see what I’m talking about in the coming month.
3417 2018-03-09 23:32:36 Can’t wait, time to learn on what not to do on Chipotle Stocks.
3418 2018-03-09 23:32:33 Yep, all the laughing stocks from before like the Rams, Jags and Browns are turning it around and making moves but the Bucs are kind of just there... with an inept coaching staff and a GM who appears more clueless by the day.
3419 2018-03-09 23:31:37 How’s that #bitcoin and #stocks being correlated discussion working out for you?
3420 2018-03-09 23:31:36 Yeah, yeah, but U never could have done this:

MAGA! @realDonaldTrump
3421 2018-03-09 23:30:53 I was sure it would be about the bump stocks.
3422 2018-03-09 23:29:21 Facts. Like okay maybe stocks aren’t your thing, but at least show me how to cook dope dad, sheesh.
3423 2018-03-09 23:29:00 I’ve only heard he had AR-15’s and bump stocks. If he had fully autos then I correct myself.
3424 2018-03-09 23:28:32 Apparently you can buy Chronos Group stocks on the Nasdaq (they're a Canadian Marijuana company) but Aurora Cannabis and Canopy Growth Corp are thinking of joining as well, and they're much bigger players, so it may be worth keeping an eye on them.
3425 2018-03-09 23:27:46 I would just sell any stocks you have and wait a few months for things to balance out. They are injecting so much money into the economy that 99% of people won't be worrying about money anymore. That's the idea. Eradicate poverty and money problems.
3426 2018-03-09 23:26:35 If we are to allow them access, there must be NO dumping of fish, reduced catch, to preserve the long term interest and fish stocks of this country.
3427 2018-03-09 23:26:05 It won’t be thousands. And the other 3 parts were that they upped the age, and the holding time and made bump stocks illegal. This is called political negotiating...something that USED TO happen around these parts.
3428 2018-03-09 23:25:56 @NRA filing suit against Florida guns law just passed including raising minimum age, banning bump stocks and allowing teachers to carry.  Maybe they are concerned about the last part
3429 2018-03-09 23:25:21 Stop pretending violent video games ever killed anyone. You know what kills people? AR-15s and guns with bump stocks and high capacity magazines...but I guess those are ok with you.
3430 2018-03-09 23:23:33 Teaching a stripper bout stocks, I get a whole lotta guap.
3431 2018-03-09 23:22:54 Multiple catalysts.  Resolution of NAFTA, Alberta - BC, breakout to highs in crude. These stocks just get cheaper. SU is the obvious anchor, but others are interesting depending on ones risk tolerance.
3432 2018-03-09 23:21:12 I don’t think that it’s not keeping pace. I know if it were me, I certainly would not want to come to the United States fearing A.R. 15‘s with bump stocks, being hunted down by a Nazi organization called ICE, Or dealing with the GOP and president that’s sworn allegiance to Russia
3433 2018-03-09 23:20:38 But the $1.5T tax cut that corporations are using to buy back stocks and contribute NOTHING to America, that was cool, right? $1.5T is approximately $77B x 18.
3434 2018-03-09 23:20:11 Stocks to Watch: TGT, AAPL, AMZN. Read our in-depth analysis for more.
3435 2018-03-09 23:19:26 That's probably true in US but I'm still seeing lot of Value in UK Stocks.
3436 2018-03-09 23:19:11 This law isn’t perfect but .@Emma4Change .@davidhogg111 & other #ParklandStudents made FL Legislature pass a compromise bill which increases age to purchase all guns to 21; makes waiting period 3 days; bans bump stocks; addresses mental health & school security. You did this!
3437 2018-03-09 23:18:44 Yep, stocks added generally get a pop & may see buying as index funds rebalance. Those removed may take an initial hit but often recover at a later date.
3438 2018-03-09 23:18:21 Not a won. It doesn't ban assault rifles. Age, bump stocks, acknowledging mental illness and arming teachers doesn't address the real problem.
3439 2018-03-09 23:18:16 #Browns are unloading draft picks like they are steel stocks.
3440 2018-03-09 23:17:50 Shit, I thought you were telling me to go all in on beer stocks. 
3441 2018-03-09 23:17:48 Well, it may take some of the wind out of the gun control sails. I can hear some people saying how changes such as these (18->21, bump stocks, etc) _could_ be sufficient and that nothing else is needed. Y'know, the ol' appeasement strategy.

3449 2018-03-09 23:11:08 True but it also bans bump stocks and adds money for mental health. More progress in a red state than in Congress

3454 2018-03-09 23:07:47 I'm a Dem. from a long line of military servicemen & hunters. I support the 2nd amendment. Time to fix it though. No semi auto weapons, bump stocks or lg cap magazines, no violent offenders or mentally unfit allowed guns, wait period & 21 yo. age limit to purchase.
3455 2018-03-09 23:06:50 Love people who claim to make a shit ton of cash doing stocks. You don’t have the money till you sell the stock and take it out, buying bitcoin at its start was smart, buying now is hoping for a miracle

3462 2018-03-09 22:59:47 #EconomyToday Great Day in Mkts. Took out 2750 resistance and closed strong. Dollar down also so Resource Stocks also pushed . Bonds sold off and all closed oh highs. Looks like a test of highs for S&P as dollar weakens and rates rise . Monday should open well . Then??
3463 2018-03-09 22:59:40 FL Legislature & Governor ban bump stocks, raise age to buy all firearms to 21, 3 day waiting pd for all firearms,  prevent sale and take firearms from dangerous people, mental health $$, school hardening, etc.. So, Congress?  Anything?!
3464 2018-03-09 22:58:10 Exactly.. the guy is comparing cryptos to stocks thats why im not replyin even
3465 2018-03-09 22:57:43 Man they banned bump fire stocks, should have gotten one while I had the chance.
3466 2018-03-09 22:57:30 The difference is the Mt. Gox bitcoins were sold by a non-economic seller. When somebody spams sell orders without regard to price it causes sharp price drops even in very liquid markets (e.g. see prolonged price declines for spin-offs in stocks).
3467 2018-03-09 22:57:27 stocks
3468 2018-03-09 22:56:32 There are thousands of more liquid stocks you can go penny-flip. By all means...
3469 2018-03-09 22:55:31 And that was mainly a time problem with people going for slower playstyles and characters like villager being open to timing people out. 2 stocks limited it down a bit that more than likely a 2 stock game would finish before time was up
3470 2018-03-09 22:55:28 And stocks closed at another record high, today.. can we get Ryan to retire as a 2 for 1 with mccant.
3471 2018-03-09 22:54:51 Looking in to buying more stocks but idk which to invest in
3472 2018-03-09 22:54:24 How does it hurt gun owners to ban bump stocks? It even gives the illusion of doing something to gun control advocates, win, win for the right!
3473 2018-03-09 22:53:50 Y updl cuando lo incorporasteis
3474 2018-03-09 22:53:46 Oh crap!  Bump stocks?  Another Obama legacy item GONE?

3484 2018-03-09 22:43:25 Do you support sensible gun laws?  What is your position on bump stocks?  Assault weapons?  Freeloading Fant?
3485 2018-03-09 22:42:06 More guns are not the answer. Fewer guns,  less ammo,  no military weapons,  no bump stocks,  extensive background checks are the answer. Stop being an NRA pawn.
3486 2018-03-09 22:42:06 Frustrating game tonight. Some tired players but also some shoddy play. @Marrsy33 @Stocks_68 you guys played well. @Josh_Scoon some good play and tries tonight, nice seeing you take your chances. @nucci39 the stick done the magic again. Onwards and upwards guys
3487 2018-03-09 22:41:43 Florida Governor Rick Scott signed new gun regs

3494 2018-03-09 22:39:23 I think the new florida gun laws is bullshit. Whats the difference from a madman buying a gun at 18 years old or 21 yrs old. No difference.bump stocks needed to be banned, but how many of them are in peoples homes and on the streets already..i wonder how many?

3499 2018-03-09 22:37:14 Bump stocks are tactically foolish anyways, I’ve never bought a gun from a gun show, and I’m a strong advocate for redemptive laws that incentivize good behaviors rather than mark people for life, creating further hopeless situations.

Universal firearms safety education anyone?
3500 2018-03-09 22:36:00 Environmental experts calculate how much we can fish without wiping out species. They tell the EU Council, which is made of NATIONAL ministers. Those ministers then divvy up the quotas among their countries.
The quota system is far from perfect but it helps maintain fish stocks.

3530 2018-03-09 22:17:10 Student activism after Parkland school shooting has made a HUGE difference. It’s not apparent from usual inaction in Congress but it is in new law passed in  conservative Florida: 3-day wait for buying firearms;  age raised to 21 for gun purchases; bump stocks banned! KEEP IT UP!

3536 2018-03-09 22:15:27 Also outlaws bump stocks. But no ban on weapons of war.  Just because Nikolas Cruz couldn’t *buy* an AR-15 doesn’t mean someone older couldn’t lend him one.
3537 2018-03-09 22:15:13 Stocks close higher after strong jobs report and US agrees to meet with North Korea.
3538 2018-03-09 22:15:00 But there is support in Congress for banning bump stocks. Also public support.

3541 2018-03-09 22:13:54 Wages rise only 2%, Wall Street celebrates.  Wages rise more than that, stocks fall from fear of inflation.  So, managers make more money is good for economy.   Labor makes more money and it's bad.  Something is wrong with this

3551 2018-03-09 22:09:52 "Arms teachers" "bans bump stocks"  he signed a bill that does pretty much what Trump wanted to do but caught heat for.
3552 2018-03-09 22:09:45 "Other provisions of the law include raising the age to purchase a firearm to 21 from 18, banning the sale or possession of bump fire stocks, giving law enforcement greater power to seize weapons and ammunition from those deemed mentally unfit"
3553 2018-03-09 22:09:30 Last week: dozens of emails on stocks

Maybe next week: dozens of emails on bonds 
3554 2018-03-09 22:08:12 FL Gov signed new gun law. It makes some improvements like banning bump stocks, and raising age to purchase shotguns and rifles to 21. Here’s what it doesn’t do: expand background checks, ban assault weapons, or enact a real extreme risk law. #NotEnough
3555 2018-03-09 22:07:47 Bans possession of bump stocks. Criminal to own one. That could be a thing.
3556 2018-03-09 22:07:10 Too little, too late. Do something with real consequences like repealing the Dickey Amendment, support an assault weapons ban & bump stocks ban, close background check loopholes.  Hold a town hall & listen to what your constituents want. 242 days till election day.

3558 2018-03-09 22:06:01 @Visa I am a customer and I want you to stop processing payments from retailers that sell assault weapons, bump stocks, and other weapons of mass murder. Many other companies have taken action, and you have a responsibility to do the same.
3559 2018-03-09 22:04:58 Stephen Paddock, age 64, murdered 58 & injured 422 in 10mins w/ semi-automatic rifles fitted w/ bumpfire stocks. He had amassed dozens of guns & thousands of rounds of ammunition, including tracer & armor-piercing. He was a gambler, not a gamer. IT’S THE GUNS, NOT THE GAMES.

3570 2018-03-09 22:03:00 Not okay with warrantless searches. Suppressors have zero to to with our gun problems. Adjustable stocks and pistol grips are ergonomic features. Given the occasional cozy relationship of police with white supremacists I'm not trusting of their means of permit denial/approval.

3589 2018-03-09 21:56:54 @benshapiro  what do you think about the law that @RickScottUpdate signed into law today changing age restraints for buying a rifle in Florida and outlawing bump stocks with no recourse for current legal bump stock owners?
3590 2018-03-09 21:56:33 Killin it with these penny stocks
3591 2018-03-09 21:55:21 Bump stocks are highly impractical, anyway. Most users aren't used to managing automatic weapon recoil and would be hitting the ceiling after the first few shots, not to mention the speed at which you deplete ammo. Probably for the better on that one.
3592 2018-03-09 21:55:01 Counters are pretty lame with literally all of the fire emblem characters except having one and 6 others having them. Counters actually seem pretty weak in 4, I rarely lose stocks to counters
3593 2018-03-09 21:54:55 Companies are buying back their stocks not putting into infrastructure or pay increases. The job gains stay in kine for the last 10 years so sorry to tell you tax cuts didn't do much
3594 2018-03-09 21:54:27 honestly, if we had characters as stocks mode, i'd play that alllll day.

3605 2018-03-09 21:48:50 Sure.  Semi automatic rifles are rifles that you just have to pull the trigger to continue firing, the only limitation being how fast you pull the trigger (bump stocks allow you to fire at many times that rate) and how big your magazine is.
3606 2018-03-09 21:48:36 It's a start! At least bump stocks were banned! At this point, it's better than nothing. #VoteBlue

3610 2018-03-09 21:46:03 VP Pence is in Ohio right now stumping with our opponent Bob Gibbs. There is actual governing to do in DC. DACA, infrastructure, and a ban on bump stocks are all begging for leadership. But Pence and Gibbs are paying attention to us. #priorities
3611 2018-03-09 21:45:20 There aren’t too many stocks that don’t ‘fill the gap’ anymore Helene. Overwhelming.
3612 2018-03-09 21:45:08 The top five stocks that fell today were $MAT, $KIM, $SCG, $AMD and $HAS
3613 2018-03-09 21:44:58 FL Gov. Rick Scott signed a new gun bill. 

What it does:
3-day waiting period for buying guns
Raises age to buy guns from 18 to 21
Bans bump stocks
Gives police more authority to confiscate weapons
Arms teachers

What it doesn’t do:
Bans assault rifles
3614 2018-03-09 21:44:27 The top five stocks that gained today were $LRCX, $WYNN, $KR, $ALXN, and $NFLX.
3615 2018-03-09 21:44:20 Bump stocks could pass SCOTUS since aromatics are already restricted. "Assault" weapons argument will also be struck down since all weapons can be assault weapons.
3616 2018-03-09 21:44:14 They just mad that they are jokes on the internet while others are bettering themselves on doing something u like to do can't they take a hint and be idiots or laughing stocks
3617 2018-03-09 21:44:06 Also bans bump stocks. It's not perfect but it's a start. Better than what they had before, which was nothing. I hope the state legislature will continue to work on making this legislation stronger.
3618 2018-03-09 21:43:56 Yeah luckily we have a Hannaford which stocks local stuff & has a A rating from HRC but the fish isn't as nice (problems of privilege , I realize)

3621 2018-03-09 21:41:49 No. I’m suggesting that with controls on things the NRA has lobbied against controls on, such as high-capacity magazines, semi-automatic weapons, and bump stocks, it would be harder for mass shooters to kill as many people as they do.

3625 2018-03-09 21:38:58 You are cool... I'm down with a lively debate. But please pick your head up. Look around, feel the optimism in business, infrastructure, trade, stocks, foreign affairs, military readiness, national security... The sky is not falling.
3626 2018-03-09 21:38:20 Californians say ... nice baby steps, Ricky.
Why not a 10 day waiting period? Floridians just that impatient?
And banning bump stocks is fine, they've been banned here since 1990, but the single best thing you could do is adopt 10 round max magazine size on all guns like us.
3627 2018-03-09 21:38:06 Most of this law I agree with.  However the definition of bump stock in the bill is so ambiguous and makes a felon out of many legal  gun owners that don't even own bump stocks depending on how one interprets it.
3628 2018-03-09 21:37:32 $pixy   S. Holmes sentcd to 15 mo prison in 03' after a business he ran filed false taxes, acc to legal docs 2013, AL ordrd Scott Absher, CEO, to stop selling securities in the state on claims he pitched unregd-stocks that failed create EPS. He denied charges but didnt respond
3629 2018-03-09 21:37:20 I skimmed through it (long document).
It does make some important changes.

- raised age to 21
- enacted blocks due to mental health and/or court orders
- no mas bump stocks
- waiting period, 3 day min or background check, whichever later

So, some definite improvements.
3630 2018-03-09 21:37:00 790.222 Bump-fire stocks prohibited. A person may not
import into this state or transfer, distribute, sell, keep for
sale, offer for sale, possess, or give to another person a bump
fire stock. A person who violates this section commits a felony
of the third degree
3631 2018-03-09 21:34:52 Sure NASDAQ at ATH is no surprise from Momo stocks.
Broader NYSE comp not so much.
3632 2018-03-09 21:34:51 Nobody "takes" anything. The debate is to stop selling certain types. You can keep whatever you have. Just can't buy things like bump stocks or extended clips anymore. If I need more than 3 shots to get a deer, I need to practice more. Not get a bigger magazine.

3634 2018-03-09 21:34:29 Rick Scott just made a $400 mil. arms deal in trade for banning bump stocks in Florida. NRA & gun manufacturers are happy & that’s all that really matters to him & the GOP

3639 2018-03-09 21:32:56 Most of this law I agree with.  However the definition of bump stock in the bill is so ambiguous and is not fair for law abiding citizens.  This definition makes a felon out of many gun owners that don't even own bump stocks.
3640 2018-03-09 21:32:18 Good start. Wish it went further. Why does a civilian need to have an assault rifle? Why not ban them altogether? Ban bump stocks but not assault rifles.... Hmmmm where's the logic?

3651 2018-03-09 21:24:36 The bill Florida Gov. Scott signed today is the first major gun control effort there in decades: ups minimum purchase age to 21 (was 18) with some exceptions; imposes three-day waiting period. Bump stocks banned. Also lets cops seek court orders to bar those deemed risky
3652 2018-03-09 21:24:06 After nine years of rising stocks, the market has been struggling. The Trump administration’s big shift on global trade hasn’t helped, our columnist says.

3660 2018-03-09 21:22:29 After nine years of rising stocks, the market has been struggling. The Trump administration’s big shift on global trade hasn’t helped, our columnist says.

3662 2018-03-09 21:21:08 Update after the close on stocks. First indicator hit late, so NOW TREND DOWN, HALF HEDGES. A slight increase in risk in the portfolios new. Heading to the golf course, so enjoy the ride everyone!
3663 2018-03-09 21:20:33 why don't you trade stocks instead of crypto?

3668 2018-03-09 21:17:12 A new record close for the Nasdaq as stocks soar. A huge rally for stocks sends stock investors home with smiles on their faces
It has been since January 26th, but today is the first day since then that we can state that a major index closed at a record level.
3669 2018-03-09 21:16:40 Solid economic news & easing trade war fears (perhaps premature) spiked world stocks: US +1.7%; Europe +.4%. Markets want to rise reflecting solid 4Q earnings & expectations of more. Market P/E is now reasonable & prices should rise if not derailed by government dysfunction.
3670 2018-03-09 21:16:02 @CNBCClosingBell Evan's claim that Dom's segment showed the reason for indexing is strange-Dom highlighted well known stocks that went up 15x to 55x and the S&P was up 4x-I would say that shows the potential of good stock picking
3671 2018-03-09 21:14:24 @DaveRamsey If you say that part of Baby Step #3 can include stocks in an E Trade and Sharebuilder account in addition to cash on hand then I can safely move on to Step #4.
3672 2018-03-09 21:14:18 And for what it's worth, I don't own any bump stocks. Personally, I think they're dumb. But I don't think they should be banned. Plenty of law abiding folks own them and use them for perfectly lawful reasons.
3673 2018-03-09 21:13:58 Good for @FLGovScott & FL Legislature for passing a compromise law which increases age to purchase all guns to 21; makes waiting period 3 days; bans bump stocks; addresses mental health & school security. Parkland students, u did this. It’s ur win. Now, if only Congress would act
3674 2018-03-09 21:13:56 What happened to BAN of Bump Stocks?

Bans bump stocks that allow guns to mimic fully automatic fire
Creates a program that enables school employees to carry handguns
3736 2018-03-09 20:47:42 It does ban bump stocks, which is fine in my opinion. I think that's sensible. It's never going to be perfect in some people's eyes though.

3752 2018-03-09 20:42:05 Not that bill, they were backing one that kept due process intact, but the Dems killed it. If someone was on the list and tried to buy a gun the FBI had three days to decide if the sale should go through or not. 
They specifically said to regulate bump stocks like machine guns.

- Imposes a 3-day waiting period for most gun purchases
- Potentially puts guns into the hands of some educators
- Bans bump stocks

3760 2018-03-09 20:40:09 Oddly I find myself not minding that bump stocks are on the chopping block, but only because I abhor the idea of someone deliberately making their firearm less controllable and harder to aim.

There's a good reason you aren't allowed to bump fire at most staffed ranges.
3761 2018-03-09 20:39:08 In Florida, there was a few failures of the laws, the FBI, and the background of this kid when he bought the gun. The cops should have done something about this kid before he done this. We can agree on things like the bump stocks that raise the fire rate need to go.

3771 2018-03-09 20:34:39 Hey, total off topic question. Do you own and guitars with inverted head stocks? If so, is it inconvenient for tuning?
3772 2018-03-09 20:33:45 #bbcaq Yup. We can do that. Take care of our fish stocks.....while the rest of the world plunders them.   We get screwed over whatever we do and well you know it. 
3773 2018-03-09 20:33:25 Bump stocks or anything that changes the power of a gun? Gone. More rigorous background checks since majority of mass shooters have guns purchased legally, no more on the spot gun show sales, better records of child abuse or domestic violence offenders so they can't buy guns...

3778 2018-03-09 20:28:40 Why is that? The bill only bans bump stocks.... everything else approved are things that shouldve been in place to begin with! Can still buy semis, can still have lg capacity magazines, comprehensive background checks still have loopholes.... so what are they crying about now?

3781 2018-03-09 20:27:29 They backed a bill to prevent the sale of guns to people on the government's terrorist watch list. The "Fix NICS Act." "Project Exile," which worked great. They favor prosecuting people who try and buy illegally. The "Gun Violence Restraining Order" idea. Regulating bump stocks.
3782 2018-03-09 20:27:05 what are the stocks?
3783 2018-03-09 20:26:52 Sure! The key is every 20 minutes, pull an Andy Dwyer and pick up the phone and tell the dial tone “Hello, Wall Street? Buy more stocks...NOW.” Trump will totally go for it.
3784 2018-03-09 20:24:24 Too easy! Hedge funds never buy stocks or asset classes at all time highs! This is a blow off top in $QQQ that will fill back its gap next week!
3785 2018-03-09 20:24:16 SOCIALISM 101: It’s an interesting market dynamic to watch equities rally on a strong jobs report (macro) and also witness individual stocks pop when significant job cuts are announced (micro).  Are just some people assets?
3786 2018-03-09 20:24:04 Humble pie gets my vote. I was lucky to have only a very mild haircut from January’s tumble. Thank heaven for Canadian bank stocks.
3787 2018-03-09 20:24:00 or maybe the reason is stocks getting hammered. Why burn money when your stock is priced as worthless.  Maybe a DVN or NFX will cut a rig any buy some shares back. Sell some gas production since those CFs are being valued at 0 by Mr. market.
3788 2018-03-09 20:22:30 I bought the dip in February and holding on to my stocks.
3789 2018-03-09 20:22:27 You want to ban bump stocks and raise the legal age to buy a gun at 21.
You're not trying to say that you're pro 2nd Amendment , are you Ladder Boy?
3790 2018-03-09 20:21:46 WTF. So how you manage a portfolio of stocks decides whether you have a voting interest in their being well run? Oh pls kill me now.
3791 2018-03-09 20:20:52 INBOX: @FLGovScott signs school safety bill passed by FL legislature in response to the #stonemanshooting. Bill raises minimum age to buy a gun to 21, and extends waiting period to include long guns and bans bump stocks.

3793 2018-03-09 20:20:12 Based on my recent experiences, Trend following tends to work better with stocks than futures .  Any thought?
3794 2018-03-09 20:19:25 You probably should have read the article. Or just avoided discussing a topic about which you're so blatantly ignorant.

The article is about banning fully automatic weapons.

Which are already banned.

Oh, there's also an ignorant attempt at banning bump stocks, but that's it.
3795 2018-03-09 20:19:20 There was no real apology. This is all staged by Disney CEO Iger. Done just because it hurts their bottom line and stocks. If Walt Disney was alive both Iger and Behar would be carrying cups begging for coins in CA, like all the other homeless and panhandlers.
3796 2018-03-09 20:19:01 False, he did not use bump stocks in this shooting.
3797 2018-03-09 20:16:27 That’s difference between knowing and LOOKS like...If it tanks, I’ll be sure to say you were right.. I have no issue with that. But again, TA works even on shitty stocks.
3798 2018-03-09 20:16:03 "Bump stock" is the all the buzz from ppl who never knew bump-fire stocks existed before Vegas. They're a novelty item that are pretty useless. Banning them is just another way to appease/outrage the ignorant on both sides.
3799 2018-03-09 20:15:45 No it does not. A bump stock can be added to an AR -15 and turn it into a automatic killing machine. Example is Vegas. He used bump stocks. More than 50 died! 500 hurt! FIVE HUNDRED. Show me a hand gun with that kind of ammo & power. Come on now.
3800 2018-03-09 20:15:35 [Looks at daily planner and tablet]  Yes, it is, honey...   [Reads the information]   Looks like we're above expectations for the stocks and bonds and our production looks good!!!

3802 2018-03-09 20:14:59 So the GOP claims the economy is great and blah blah blah. Then they say the banks are being crippled by regulators. If the economy is great then y do u need to deregulate the banks? GOP claims stocks and jobs have never been higher. Then y do u need to deregulate the banks?

3806 2018-03-09 20:09:37 Martha got screwed over so bad....Her advisor told her things might be going bad so she sold. Meanwhile @realDonaldTrump former advisor and friend sold like 30million in stocks(steel company) last week before the steel tarif was announced. Nothings going to happen to either one.
3807 2018-03-09 20:09:32 I took a look. Its cheap on an asset basis but I'm guessing your reason for considering it one of the "best" deep value shares is that they have a dividend and earnings. In other words its cheap and it has some quality. I'm not sure how important quality is for these stocks.
3808 2018-03-09 20:09:00 cant wait to get back into stocks. fuck crypto shit is dead
3809 2018-03-09 20:08:31 I'm a real motivator. Sometimes I take stocks of broccoli out to the Arboretum and tell them, "This could be you if you just applied yourself."
3810 2018-03-09 20:08:05 Yeah, me too ofc. 
I mean they did do 4 stocks 8 minutes at the smash 4 invitational in 2013. So it's actually likely
We need our smash influencers to come forward and speak about that topic when the time comes

3823 2018-03-09 19:59:08 If they ban bump stocks then that’s will be awesome! But there’s a whole world between what they say and what they’ll do! Other experts who said the law made it so Obama had no choice.
3824 2018-03-09 19:58:51 (6)Trump is saying that they are going to outlaw bump stocks, raise the age to purchase these weapons to 21, & they are also trying to figure out what they can do to make the schools safer...
3825 2018-03-09 19:58:10 @Stocktwits started buying stocks in May 2009
3826 2018-03-09 19:57:56 @nytimes @washingtonpost Please do articles on 1) ages of mass shooters; 2)who used an AR-15) 3)who used a bump stock 4) who used any other automatic/semi-automatic weapon. Prez/NRA are trying to distract with raising age & banning bump stocks.
3827 2018-03-09 19:57:26 Why do people dislike rage so much? It does many good things for the game (seriously):

- Games are never over (super important for watcher perspective)
- Combos and gameplay overall are less static
- You have an incentive to get stocks early and not by slowly accumulating damage

3829 2018-03-09 19:56:26 Correct! #earnings are not always the main factor that drive short-term stocks prices. However, over the long haul, stock prices always, without fail, follow the direction of their sustainable earnings streams. Lots of diligent analysis needed to determine future sustainable EPS!

3831 2018-03-09 19:56:19 Even though he’s setting up a plan to make bump stocks illegal and making actual attempts to stop these massive mass shootings, also trying to create peace withNOKO and eliminate the threat there. With also more accomplishments.

3834 2018-03-09 19:54:44 Rage was a good addition along with the new ledge mechanics and everyone having a good recovery.  Rage prioritizes efficient edge guarding and optimal stock taking, which is fundamental in a platform fighter (stocks, not damage).  It wouldn’t work in other games but it works here

3839 2018-03-09 19:51:16 people cheer this as a tax the rich scheme. Its unfair. They don’t tax wealth like stocks and bonds and real estate held outside Canada. And it doesn’t adjust for the mortgages on many homes. With the $3MM + surtax for ‘schools’ and PPT, looks like a ‘jealousy’tax
3840 2018-03-09 19:51:03 To be more precise: when @GlenCasada shoots down affordable housing, bans on bump stocks, and votes to keep child marriages because he didn’t read the bill, he’s got no credibility.
3841 2018-03-09 19:50:27 So I give blood, and I received a message just yesterday saying that due to the period of bad weather the country has just had, blood stocks are low and there is a high demand for blood right now, so I went to book, No spaces until fucking July what would be the fucking point
3842 2018-03-09 19:50:04 Bump stocks are something that can be discussed, just like everything else. But yes, a thirty round magazine is completely understandable for a citizen to have. When under pressure, it can be extraordinarily tough to defend oneself when having a small supply of rounds.

3890 2018-03-09 19:29:53 Stocks should peak just before legalization or just after if legal shortages lead to retail price spikes. Excess supply hits in early 2019 and retail prices should start falling shortly after, dragging stocks down with them. We won't cover unless fundamentals change

3906 2018-03-09 19:23:57 Georgism would say that land is the only form of absentee investment that one should expect a positive return from. Capital depreciates. These sort of "capital stocks" are largely indirect holdings of land (in the economic sense).
3907 2018-03-09 19:23:40 I have just picked up shares of Aphria @aphriainc and Aurora Cannabis @Aurora_MMJ - Aphria looks great here and I see Weed Stocks making a run very soon.  Still Cannabis Wheaton- CBW.v is my favourite play and biggest holding @Wheatonincome  "Buy Best of Breed"

3920 2018-03-09 19:18:38 Lucio could buy the massive stocks ?!? >:( 
3921 2018-03-09 19:17:59 A significant factor, although Brexiteers seem mostly to also be climate change deniers too an dhence don't accept it, is that the warming of the North Sea has driven stocks of mature cod and haddocks north - thus moving more of them into Norwegian and Icelandic waters
3922 2018-03-09 19:16:32 I took a similar loss. However how many stocks have we held while 20% down only to get back into profit. Overall I would say I’m quite even, selling 4 stocks at 20% loss would give you more loss than selling 1 at over 60%
3923 2018-03-09 19:16:12 U keep piling up stocks when you have 29 and 97 on your team, i mean eventually it will turn, not to mention 93 is a good player as well. 
98 MIGHT form into something, so IF Dahlin went to Oilers, then that be insane
3924 2018-03-09 19:14:45 So yeah, there are jobs, but they don't pay enough to get ahead because the rich guys keep all the profits for more stocks. Most of us dont own stocks, just one of those crappy underpaying jobs that make the rich richer!
3925 2018-03-09 19:14:40 I'm weird about my even numbers for some reason. I like them. My fave random follows have been for penny stocks & cryptocurrency... which sounds like money in a fantasy story.

I'm really slow about following back most of the time anyway. (It's a protective measure.)
3926 2018-03-09 19:14:27 @sainsburys hey guys  How can I go about requesting my local store stocks more vegan products? Currently there are very little options in my locals (3x stores in central London, zone 2)
3927 2018-03-09 19:13:54 Rage would be better in a game with more than 2 stocks but its not bad. The only really thing bad about it is that it affects base knockback which opens up janky KOs like falling out of multi hits. Definitely not the worst comeback mechanic. *cough* blue shell *cough*

3929 2018-03-09 19:12:41 There were two other difference between then and now: we didn't have military grade weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines easily available to anybody, and we didn't have mass shootings where dozens were killed. Usually when you add 1 and 1 you get 2.

3942 2018-03-09 19:08:57 Bump stocks allow you to turn a semi-auto into an auto. Sure, it's not "technically" an auto, but it fires at a comparable rate. These mod needs to be banned. Even Trump supports that idea and hopefully he signs that EO soon like he said he would.

3998 2018-03-09 18:44:18 And as for how to fix this?
Gun control, that's the f--king answer.

Guns locked in safes, unloaded. Period.
No extended magazines.
No bump stocks.
No assault rifles/weapons that are a non-automatic version of the M16.
Banning weapon possession from domestic abusers.

4003 2018-03-09 18:42:36 That’s an opinion, not fact. No evidence or facts out to prove that deregulation helps economy. Lowering of corporate tax rate is now showing that corporations are buying back stocks, rather than invest in workforce

Accelerated rate hikes and the Fed getting ahead of the curve -> "good for stocks"

Did I miss anything?
4013 2018-03-09 18:38:14 Lot of stocks getting close to their option pin pricing, might have to consider laying off weekly scalps at this point in the day.
4014 2018-03-09 18:38:09 David is right.  Time for common sense gun laws.  Universal background checks, 48 hour hold or until background check comes back clean, no bump stocks, no 100 shell magazines, and licensing (with required classes and test).  That will do for a start.  1/2

4037 2018-03-09 18:27:27 of course thems are the coins and stocks you trade. and yes of course you love RIP. And do you work for BofA? Chase?
4038 2018-03-09 18:27:21 Also, how many American stocks they own? We are in grave danger!
4039 2018-03-09 18:26:30 O my god I'm tired of hearing about Goldman when there are thousands of stocks that are way more important. Brutal crap
4040 2018-03-09 18:26:01 I WOULD ADVICE TO STAY AWAY FROM FNO IF YOU ARE SMALL TRADER. AND IF STILL YOU WANT TO TRADE IN FNO THEN INDEX OPTIONS IS BEST TO START WITH. IN #Nifty YOU WILL GET MONTHLY EXPIRY WHILE IN #banknifty  EXPIRY IS EVERY WEEK.

4046 2018-03-09 18:23:09 $ES_F  The tech stocks and the financials have been strong all day. I clearly was not using my head! Really pissed at myself.  Im taking the PitBulls advice, after making stupid mistakes... push back and not trade for a few days.
4047 2018-03-09 18:23:08 Some of the moves are relentless especially the tech glamour stocks. Could be short covering!
4048 2018-03-09 18:23:01 back to the penny stocks?
4049 2018-03-09 18:22:59 Poor reporting again by LJS. Slide fire stocks or “bump stocks” do NOT turn a semiautomatic rifle into a select fire, full auto firearm. That is disinformation. That rifle with the slide fire stock is still a semiautomatic rifle. Nothing in the upper receiver has been altered.
4050 2018-03-09 18:22:49 Hahaha ang problema ay did they really tell BIR ning pagbenta nila sa OMIDYAR ng stocks nila @ kung gaano kalaki.deny to death nga sila sa sec eh 
4051 2018-03-09 18:22:22 Keep in mind that the mini 14 is a "rancher gun". What makes the AR special is that is lighter, has less recoil, has a tactical rail for accessories, can be modified for an automatic mode such as with bump stocks, a binary trigger or drum magazines....

4056 2018-03-09 18:19:47 I have had full green runs in trucks and street stocks, Phoenix can be rad.
4057 2018-03-09 18:19:39 So I started buying and selling stocks, and I love it.
4058 2018-03-09 18:18:55 Kindly giveaway some gifts for the current Mothe tokens holders as well.. ICO contributors might have sold out the stocks om exchanges.. The real supporters of monetha are those who are still holding and trusting Monetha Team for long term. 
4059 2018-03-09 18:18:50 Have read article.  This is literally the LEAST you can do without doing nothing.  This is a start.  Do not let it stop there.  Ban bump stocks, ban semi-automatic rifles.  Zip code:  78253
4060 2018-03-09 18:18:28 Great and I agree but how are those Russia sanction going? Seems like Putin got the right horse to win the race. No sanctions on him KJU fake beef w/ DTJ now they all win win. While Ichan making a shit ton on shorting steel stocks. I’m wondering who’s getting a piece.

4066 2018-03-09 18:15:56 Andu man. Madami ako stocks here bading hahaha
4067 2018-03-09 18:15:54 Following these stocks is so depressing
4068 2018-03-09 18:15:48 Corporations buying back their stocks and laying off white collar workers by the thousands.
4069 2018-03-09 18:14:44 Work on the background, it's too dark and plain for the text and effects to be at full effect, also work on your stocks, they are too repetitive and not enough change, making the text blend with the red theme would help the overall appearance. But it's nice, keep it up for sure!
4070 2018-03-09 18:12:44 quick peek at the #TSX60 $TSX - like to look at average daily 50-day price movement ( #volatility ) - several stocks +/-3.5% per day while +/-1% on the low end
4071 2018-03-09 18:11:38 Toy manufacturing stocks are already crashing as the industry is preparing to loose roughly 15% of their sales this year due to Toys R Us closing. This could possibly put Mattel under the ground also. They cant afford much disruption.
4072 2018-03-09 18:11:31 My long-term targets on these stocks
May make feel a bit exaggeration .But
I m prepared for a long long journey in
These stocks.

Balasore.   1000

Jayneco .    250

Inditrade.     3000

Ashok leyland.   1500

Rel home.   1000

I have a time frame of 7000days approx
20 years.
4073 2018-03-09 18:11:02 Best job reports for the stock market are usually the worst for the People.  Markets loved strong job growth but NO WAGE GROWTH.  Meaning, the People are working harder, making no more, as stocks go to all-time highs.  The People deserve more. #Revolution
4074 2018-03-09 18:10:47 Indefensible! Millennials Uninstalled My Blue Chip Stocks ?!
4075 2018-03-09 18:10:45 Technically it's up 200pts from feb low which made me to lock some profits. S&P still could break above 52wk high but would rather take 50% profits now then wait for all time high. I still ride the stocks. Take profit when market is high & buy when market is low/panic.
4076 2018-03-09 18:07:48 It has always maintained a discount close to 60%. When #Bajaj grp #stocks will go up so will this one

I'm very bullish on this #smallcap
4077 2018-03-09 18:07:19 Key insight - stocks still cheap vs bonds using the Fed Model.  Money always flows where it is treated best. Surging earnings offsetting rising yields.  Exclusive focus on PEs without considering bond yields is the equivalent of flying blind.
4078 2018-03-09 18:07:13 Think about what happened yesterday: Trump and Kim Jong-Un agreed to meet, The FBI conformed they are investigation the Clinton Foundation, Huge jobs report of 313,000 new jobs, Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum and today stocks are up with all the news
4079 2018-03-09 18:06:45 The same way USDA goes back and changes beginning stocks from 1, 2, or 3 years ago.
4080 2018-03-09 18:05:47 But yes, tech stocks are wayyyy up.
4081 2018-03-09 18:04:03 I'm going to nap so my general answer is prepare for the next few days when you have a good day. Everything from kitchen prep & shopping to putting emergency stocks nearby. It's always nice to have snacks, drinks, & books handy.
4082 2018-03-09 18:03:57 2017 was a record year for the market. Stocks aren't plummeting, it just can't maintain record growth
4083 2018-03-09 18:03:07 #Stocks,#Indexes No top signal. Going long: SPX=2773; NDX=7065.
4084 2018-03-09 18:03:04 It will be the @NRA that loses the Americans gun rights because they won't work together on common sense gun reform. No 18 yr old kid should be allowed to by a military style gun. No person should own a military style guns with out a training course. Bump stocks need to b banned!
4085 2018-03-09 18:03:00 Someone asked me If I were to buy a stock, what would it be? Well, what they don't know is I buy always. But my top pick would be #JPMorgan, just saying, someone asked. #invest #stocks

4087 2018-03-09 18:02:23 Why might stocks go right back down, making it stupidly dangerous to base #political arguments on market moves? Because GOOD #economic #news means higher #InterestRates--a negative for stocks.

4091 2018-03-09 18:01:14 Weird thumb hole stocks are banned on semi automatic.  Never thought there was much advantage in it.  Wild guess, some thumb holes are reamed out to make a 'near' pistol grip.  Which is again, stupid.

4106 2018-03-09 17:57:55 I watched my 401K go up for 8 straight years under Obama. You realize stocks can go up as well as down, right? 

Trump's been accused of sexual harassment/assault by 19 women. But you knew that already. So long, sucker!
4107 2018-03-09 17:57:54 By legal definition, the only "part" that is considered a firearm is the lower receiver. By this logic, we can ban barrels, upper receivers, stocks the whole nine yards.

4109 2018-03-09 17:57:24 That's really funny my stocks has fallen dramatically all because of you and your stupid tariffs resign while the gettin's good
4110 2018-03-09 17:57:12 Cohn resigns, tariffs passed, yet stocks surging. Focus on surging positive economic & earnings growth powering stocks due 2 tax reform, dereg & > confidence.  Admin focused on the economy.  They are rational, not foolish.  Expensive (hi opportunity cost) 2 believe Trump stupid.
4111 2018-03-09 17:55:55 Mueller on one side and #StormyDaniels on the other. Buy popcorn  stocks people 
4112 2018-03-09 17:55:16 How many times do I have to block your pump accounts? Stop pumping shitty stocks. Every one of your stocks your bosses promos take on tank and fuck people.
4113 2018-03-09 17:54:52 I agree. When stocks were up they said thanks obama... when stocks dropped they blamed trump. It’s comical.

4136 2018-03-09 17:42:10 Banks get bailed out and stocks are different entirely.

If everyone dumped $AAPL on the open market, it would take the price via simple market mechanics, but meanwhile private investors would be tripping over themselves to buy an entity that churns out $75B in annual cash flow.

4142 2018-03-09 17:38:22 NO THEY HAVENT! Stop spreading fear. They asked to do exactly what Florida is doing right now! Bump stocks, military weapons do not need to be in a home. Every country but US knows this???
4143 2018-03-09 17:38:13 Ahhh then it could be cause she didn't have enough stocks;; took in too much orders lo smh well she could've produce more 
4144 2018-03-09 17:38:08 Nope. Actually,  I said point blank a few times that I don't care one way or another about bump stocks or if people own them/ own guns.  But you don't like to pay attention to anything I've actually said and like to say I want things I don't.

4147 2018-03-09 17:36:52 The market contiues to condition the dip buyers. And stocks are under distribution. Matter of time...IMO
4148 2018-03-09 17:36:33 Bump stocks aren't firearms or even really arms,  they're an accessory,  meaning they aren't necessarily guaranteed coverage under 2a, hence the ban not being unconstitutional,  which has been my whole point the whole time.
4149 2018-03-09 17:36:03 This is just as bad as the #askneel where he neglected to provide a response on whether he thought it was appropriate for Swiss Bank to print billions out of thin air to buy US tech stocks.
4150 2018-03-09 17:35:45 Mag 2 am thoughts mi ug stocks hahaha
4151 2018-03-09 17:35:39 Hey Trump! Did u not say that you alone were going to ban Bump Stocks? What's taking so long? Was that just more BS from u for optics? WPE!
4152 2018-03-09 17:34:02 We must support Trump’s boom in Economy, Jobs, stocks! Dimms have no programs, no leaders, no money and no ethics!
4153 2018-03-09 17:33:25 the balloon loans- etc- borrowing against stocks- etc not the toys r us specifically but the mismanagement & shortsighted perspective- but everyone reacts diff in “survival” emo.
4154 2018-03-09 17:33:11 They would have used a different SA.  Parkland shouldn’t have passed a background check (issues 1 and 2), LV shouldn’t have had bump stocks or big mags (3 and 4) and I don’t know about his ammo but that’s probably 5.
4155 2018-03-09 17:32:51 Stocks Rising 
4156 2018-03-09 17:31:54 He’s a lefty Dimm - look what Lefty Obama did to our Economy! Compare that to what  Trump has done in ONE year! Boom in Economy, Jobs, stocks and freedom! Democratic Party opposes this progress ! How can you go BACKWARDS! Steelworkers now praise Trump!
4157 2018-03-09 17:30:58 wow.. I am in $AMZN , $NTNX .. somehow $BIDU - I missed it.. looking for an entry point.. hopefully this market will give me:)
4158 2018-03-09 17:30:53 I know that, feel free to read my other tweets.  I have repeatedly said that bump stocks will be replaced with other things (binary triggers, etc) if banned.

4160 2018-03-09 17:30:30 The same week the Stormy issue comes to light, Cohn quits, he doesn't do anything about bump stocks (after saying it was "done"), holds a ridiculous session on video games as a distraction, more known Russia contacts, KAC & Hatch, etc.  We are in a world of hurt here.
4161 2018-03-09 17:29:29 Ban 80% lowers
Ban the sale of full auto trigger groups as "parts"
Mandatory insurance
Ban fire adjustment systems

There's a lot more than just banning bump stocks.
4162 2018-03-09 17:28:59 Members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) said the report the report is expected before the end of the year. Why so long? This gives Wells Fargo more time to sell stocks to suckers.

4163 2018-03-09 17:28:06 Yesterday Miles Standish was put in the stocks for having been overheard saying “I’m not part of any particular group.”
4164 2018-03-09 17:27:40 untrue. Most broths/stocks are made in an entirely separate process from the soup in large quantities then stored until the soup is being made. A good stock take 5 or 6 hours of simmering.

4171 2018-03-09 17:26:19 ive been assuming that cryptocurrency is like stocks but its probably not. like in the way where you buy it low and then if its up really high where u think its the peak you could sell it for a lot and then watch the idiots who buy it  see it drop drastically from the peak where

4175 2018-03-09 17:23:49 #Stocks,#Indexes Waiting on the still potential top signal.  Will know within 1 hour.
4176 2018-03-09 17:23:36 Also, the semi-auto loopholes with positive reset trigger systems and bump stocks is ridiculous, and those manufacturers are intentionally skirting the law.

There is zero reason a military grade *assault rifle* should be in the hands of untrained civilians.
4177 2018-03-09 17:23:20 could easily have said "when the hill side drops a limited edition $200 canvas square"
4178 2018-03-09 17:22:09 Yes I do believe that NK wants Nuclear War.... They HAVE to Rid their entire stocks and quickly as President Trump will take no nonsense. Kim Jong Un and his regime are the Scum of the World. Trump shouldn't sit down with him until proof is shown that Nukes are being dismantled

4180 2018-03-09 17:21:03 You can carry many pistols meaning the "ammo" argument is irrelevant, bump stocks should be illegal, that doesn't mean ban the AR-15, it means ban bump stocks, and an AR-15 requires more aim than a  pistol due to the recoil you'll experience shooting one
4181 2018-03-09 17:21:00 #Stocks rise on goldilocks labor market report with strong job growth but moderating wage gains relieving inflation concerns & fears of aggressive Fed rate hikes.

4184 2018-03-09 17:18:47 That clip was a whole lot of speculation fact 1) EU = unlimited immigration, fact 2) EU = political union (it's in the name) fact 3) EU= total loss of control over our fish stocks (rest of the EU don't really have any). These facts will not go away. Brexit is the only solution
4185 2018-03-09 17:18:21 How is Scott Wapner talking about stocks?!? What is Wapner doing on a stock market program? lol Scott, Trump has led to economic acceleration & sentiment, rates will creep higher, banks are cheaps, buybacks, dvds....geeeeez!

4208 2018-03-09 17:12:31 Agree with you on bump stocks. I can't find any information to support your statement about pistol firing speed, but it is evident that a pistol must be aimed somewhat to do the most effective damage -- whereas something like an AR15 doesn't require perfect aim.

4213 2018-03-09 17:10:58 Bump Stocks. How is that ban you promised coming along?
4214 2018-03-09 17:10:41 Stocks are enjoying a relief rally thanks to a soft wage number (Fr morning) and (to a lesser extent) the nuanced metals tariff announcement.

4216 2018-03-09 17:09:38 Never heard of Bump stocks before!
4217 2018-03-09 17:09:35 To be honest I think we should just abandon stocks all together and decide our sets with the classic RPS.  Perfectly balanced gameplay, intense mindgames, high tension.  Optimal.
4218 2018-03-09 17:08:47 A pistol CAN be fired as fast as an AR-15, and I don't think bump stocks should be legal either, both guns are semi automatic meaning as fast as you pull the trigger, that's how fast each bullet with be shot

4227 2018-03-09 17:05:26 Fl. Gov. Scott 2 sign new gun bill.  THIS bill raises the age 2 purchase guns to 21, bans bump stocks. Bump stocks R not commonly used by terrorists. Most mass shootings were committed by people over 21.  CONSERVATIVES helping future LIBs. remove all guns from FL. 1 step @ a time
4228 2018-03-09 17:05:04 I trust NOTHING from the Trump "administration" he like numbers to brag about so they give him numbers to prevent the #RathOfDon . Companies are going out of business, retailers are closing doors, corporations are buying back stocks-where are the jobs coming from???

4241 2018-03-09 17:00:13 A libertarian revolution has to occur before we get the ability to directly buy stocks with cryptocurrency in an unregulated non-KYC way. Expect bitcoin to be merely an unregulated currency. Great for general savings but in the long term not great for retirement savings.
4242 2018-03-09 16:58:51 I’ve noticed stocks are only “volatile” after a series of big drops. But they must go up too to be volatile, right?

4244 2018-03-09 16:57:44 Bump stocks have no use other than what the Las Vegas killer used his for, indiscriminate shooting at a large mass of people. There is no accuracy when using a bump stock so making them illegal is fine with me.

4258 2018-03-09 16:52:11 John Cornyn is the @NRA Manchurian Candidate in Texas.  They bribed him with $60,000 to ensure assault weapons are unregulated, bump stocks remain legal and gun show loopholes remain. Currently a felon can buy an AR-15 at a gunshow undetected. The NRA owns @JohnCornyn
4259 2018-03-09 16:51:50 People SHORT stocks like its a LONG. Shorting requires a mindset not a click of a button. How are you trying to short a stock when everyone and their mothers are LONGING it and were talking about LONGING it on twtr. #SAD paper trade to learn and then maybe you'll earn.

*HF started by the billionaire investor Alan Howard last year gained 3% in February and 4% in January
*AH Master Fund gained through bets on rising bond yields and by avoiding stocks
4292 2018-03-09 16:37:49 I really don't need you to fix anything for me. Higher wages, more job, economy improving, conservative judges, more money from stocks in my IRA, more support for law enforcement. Eventually health care I can afford to use. Life is getting better and better.
4293 2018-03-09 16:36:54 Then they could make twice the money, First by selling the stocks and then by shorting them again  #RandomThought
4294 2018-03-09 16:36:52 That’s bullish for stocks

4300 2018-03-09 16:34:07 No such thing.  The markets go up because they can.  

Bond traders are as geared toward capital gains as anybody.  They’ll sell the bonds and look for some that returns more...capital appreciation of stocks.

4302 2018-03-09 16:33:11 No, I think you're lying.  If they were that easily modified, we would see them used all the time in criminal acts.  We don't.  That is why "bump stocks" were invented.
4303 2018-03-09 16:32:34 Friends... @SetYourStop just made an AMAZING point in the Trading Room.  "There's 1000s of stocks to pick from..." Question is WHY are you in one that isn't working for you?

4308 2018-03-09 16:29:35 In black swan, stocks can drop 50% in one day for example. A buy and hold investor in $SPY won't get ruined if unleveraged. A vol trader will probably get ruined. Do you see the difference? Not useless to imagine at all because if you ruined, it is out of the game.

4310 2018-03-09 16:28:59 It's been nine years since the S&P 500 hit its lowest point in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008. And if you started buying stocks then, as @BarackObama suggested at the time, you'd have made a very handsome return.
4311 2018-03-09 16:28:02 You can think that all you want. Doesn’t change the facts. I think people who put their wants (in certain kinds of guns and bump stocks) over the lives of Americans dying are morons. Difference is I used critical thinking, not wishful thinking like you.
4312 2018-03-09 16:27:53 um... bump stocks?

4324 2018-03-09 16:24:16 Stocks look bullish - $ndx and $comp at new highs. Low probability we get a low retest any time soon. Trump exempting Canada and Mexico indefinitely is a big signal that pro-NAFTA lobby is being listened to. Negotiations will be tough but trade war concerns r still premature imho
4325 2018-03-09 16:24:13 @SirFlopsalot @jon1212 why it took of on your 4th chart then? Don’t think it’s at the same level now is it? That’s how stocks move.
4326 2018-03-09 16:22:55 I'm glad I never sold all of my @MarkelleF stocks, and even bought everybody else's undervalued ones. We accounting majors stick together.
4327 2018-03-09 16:22:00 In terms of additional game modes, I would not mind having the mode where you can have each of your stocks be a different character. PM did it, I don't remember what its called LMAO

4408 2018-03-09 15:59:33 NASDAQ Composite has surpassed its January peak today, but only about half as many stocks that trade on the NASDAQ are making new highs vs what was seen in January. In fact at this point there are fewer new highs on the NASDAQ today than yesterday.

4411 2018-03-09 15:59:00 Umm no the media never said that.  They said prices of the goods the tariffs are for would increase therefore stocks rise.  Steel/aluminum now cost more to consume or utilize.  Companies got to jack up prices on their goods without adding any value.

4425 2018-03-09 15:53:24 Facts. . .like Trump’s approval rating is higher than Obama’s. The economy is humming. Stocks are high. Wages are rising. Unemployment is at record low. ISIS has been decimated on the ground. N. Korea is opening up to talks. But, but, Trump’s tone...!  Liberals hate facts.

4427 2018-03-09 15:52:49 There is a big difference between people showing up and stating their opinions (right or wrong) and having a conversation vs. the site itself deleting half the debate (often the side with some facts) and shorting their members stocks in to the ground.
4428 2018-03-09 15:52:48 Can't figure out why there is so much scepticism around our markets as not a slightest of buying interest seen in quality stocks, which were flying few months ago like there's no tomorrow.

4431 2018-03-09 15:51:23 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

4444 2018-03-09 15:48:50 With the tax relief given to them, companies are buying back their own stocks to keep them artificially high.  When they fall, as they'll have to, the sound will reverberate around the world as it did in 1929.

4455 2018-03-09 15:44:19 Spreads are very common on trading markets. In financial stocks brokers will usually charge a much higher commission and spread. Spreads on football index can sometimes work in users favour as it can protect there portfolio from a mass panic sale

4474 2018-03-09 15:35:47 Trump is not the problem. We are. For whatever reason, bills that never would have passed under Obama are going through and the NRA's strategy on bump stocks completely backfired. Also, with so many people calling Trump "Hitler", you'd think they wouldn't be for gun control.

4540 2018-03-09 15:13:59 A faster uptrend in wages sustained over time would mark a crucial turning point for investors, signaling the economy is speeding up and could pressure inflation higher. That, in turn, may push the Federal Reserve to lift rates faster, impeding a further move higher in stocks.

4621 2018-03-09 14:50:03 perhaps - but that takes the focus away from this point that shift to passive is pushing up prices of largest caps (which I maintain is flawed logic)... the biggest ETF's implement something like 99.9% full replication (i.e. pretty much ALL stocks in proportion)

4630 2018-03-09 14:46:02 Traditional asset classes preserve purchasing power just fine. The USD for example is supposed to lose 2%-3% of value every year by design, because it is best for the economy as a whole. To avoid that loss one has tools such as term deposits, the ability to invest in stocks, etc.
4631 2018-03-09 14:45:42 Most stock investors, unlike many bond investors, are not precision oriented. The reason for that is that performance of stocks is dependent on future events, something about which no one knows with any precision.

4666 2018-03-09 14:31:34 That's a great idea about the meeting. The three top shareholders are people though. Some of their firms own stocks from purchases. The 3 top shareholders are people not investment firms.
4667 2018-03-09 14:30:58 .@realdonaldtrump I agree with @gunowners, if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more using the argument they also “accelerate” the fire of a gun. Instead, please insist on clean carry reciprocity

4674 2018-03-09 14:29:49 @DLoesch  Florida surprise: Ban on Bump stocks ok. 21 age to by rifle is unfair to teenage hunters. 3 day waiting period could be the start of a slippery slope.  3 day waiting period would not have stopped the school shooting and Criminals do not wait 3 days to steal a gun.

4729 2018-03-09 14:05:16 And I didn’t say “no bump stocks” because then you just use something else.  Limit modifications of any kind that make it rapid fire.  Define a rate and ban all of them that have more capability than that under a given set of conditions.

4914 2018-03-09 12:45:33 @realDonaldTrump I agree with @gunowners and @NRA that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor (Obama-style) can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more -- Instead arm teachers, pass national reciprocity now and ban ALL gun free killing zones

We need universal background checks. We need to enforce CAP laws. We need to ban high capacity magazines and bump stocks.

4926 2018-03-09 12:39:43 In fact, the only thing that really concerns me for next week is the tendency of late for stocks to rise during OX week.  Fortunately, the charts don't seem to verify that.

Wonder why Sebi allows F&O in so many individual stocks by NSE. Pure and unadulterated way to milk foolish retail and also earn brokerage for members. Nothing else.

4946 2018-03-09 12:26:16 #Stocks,#Indexes In view of a not high fidelity completion, do we act, or wait on the assumption of a better completion, and reduced probability of buying early.

4947 2018-03-09 12:24:47 most bourbon must be a 3-year old spirit. I was tasting Irish whiskeys last night that sold for £200 - £300 a bottle because they had become collectors' items. Collecting has depleted the stocks of oldish whisky and the prices have gone through the roof.

5049 2018-03-09 10:56:49 If you look at the people behind many of these listed penny stocks you end up coming across the same names time and time again. There may be years apart but their actions suggest that they are very experienced at pumping then dumping and moving onto the next one. Digraceful

5095 2018-03-09 10:19:26 That’s something I will agree on. I always laugh when somebody say anybody other than the MM can possibly short these stocks.

5161 2018-03-09 09:11:45 Thanks for the reminder! I think Asda is the only place near me that still stocks the latter-day 'hair gel ad' incarnation of NME – a pallet near the entrance groaning beneath hundreds of untouched  copies.

5163 2018-03-09 09:08:30 Hello Sir @Adityaskarnik Could you please suggest 4 to 5 diversified and fundamentally strong stocks which I can monitor and invest during their dips for a 5-6 years term. kind of a SIP model but only during their dip.
5164 2018-03-09 09:08:14 Or I’m poor. Or I don’t want to own them; maybe I like doing factory work. Again, you seem to see “hard work” as one thing only without taking in the full scope of labor. I don’t think you’d say someone who carries and stocks refrigerators all day, i.e., isn’t “working hard.”
5165 2018-03-09 09:08:05 You could also say i want also more coins so part of profit create new coins. The website gets 1% x 10 as money and can invest extra in website and put money in real stocks lets say 10% profit a year. We could sell 100% but somebody need to put text on website want money to

5421 2018-03-09 05:29:07 Be careful. Chances are stocks will be very limited what with the high demand and exclusivity. I'm just warning you if you haven't already realized. If you want it, you'll want to get it ASAP or preorder it or whatever you can do with Amiibos (I've never gotten one).

5433 2018-03-09 05:19:25 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
5434 2018-03-09 05:19:09 They're now advocating policies for manufacturing and tariffs. Just wait, they'll tell you stocks to buy and weather next week. Howling for change is not the same as being productive.
5435 2018-03-09 05:17:38 2/2: the point of this debate is about proper control of weapons and banning certain categories: e.g. assault weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines and also who can own them: i.e. proper background checks. 2A is not under threat and never has been.

5452 2018-03-09 04:59:12 But why are steel stocks falling. Even though exposure to US is very minimum. Whether I missing something?
5453 2018-03-09 04:58:44 It is just sooo slow compared to melee. They only play with 2 stocks where as we play 4 stocks in melee. I could go on for hours why that game is inferior but it would be hard to explain.
5454 2018-03-09 04:58:15 Of course, they legalized insider trading for themselves. Any private citizen doing the same would be in jail faster than Margaret Stewart, who made $45K.  Legalized stealing.  Time for Carl Ichan to be charged for selling his steel stocks just before Trump announce tariffs.

We had a mix of deflaton/inflation.

5531 2018-03-09 04:03:59 Yes, I have used it for forty years on hundreds of hyperwaves. I always check log charts also. These phase lines are linear, each one of them. Log charts distort them. Week candles work the best. I built the theory using stocks, indexes and commodities. These close at end of week

They didn't short the market.

Currently only 50% of funds invested.

5552 2018-03-09 03:51:18 That was a nice 30-40% gain (depending on when you got in) in a week for us on $LIX. These are the types of stocks we need to focus on. I have a few I will be completing some DD over the weekend. Stay tuned
5553 2018-03-09 03:50:49 Otherwise you just get another gun, and modify it instead.  Or ban bump stocks, and then people will use the triggers that fire on pull and release instead.  The "Assault Weapons" ban is full of holes, drives responsible owners nuts because it's not effective for that reason.

5575 2018-03-09 03:40:52 Sometimes in this market there is things you can’t dictate, the beautiful thing about stocks is that you always pretty much have the option to sell at any point but there’s that 1% of time you can’t... such has suspension, big gap downs and such... I’m always prepared though
5576 2018-03-09 03:40:04 SNB owns size in the FANG stocks. Any wonder those never stay down?  How do they ever lose in that game?
5577 2018-03-09 03:39:34 I also believe there are contract talks with the UAW that probably add to their problems.  Like the article said,,,, avoid this stock.  I'd go one farther and avoid all car stocks.
5578 2018-03-09 03:39:22 I'm not reading much into that. Legal documents are always all inclusive, to make sure there's no loopholes.
Example: for someone's financial records, you'd demand info on stocks and bonds, even if you know in advance they don't own any.

PBOC ditto 
So -- WHY do you think stocks will crash, exactly? 
Why doesn't oil go up like AMZN? SNB ain't buying oil.
5581 2018-03-09 03:37:14 What is your plan to do so? Stocks? Options? Shifting certain things?
5582 2018-03-09 03:36:27 Sorry to jump in... You're still including me.

There are still sanctions in place. Trump doesn't feel additional are required at this time.

For the stocks. It's not always about the money when you do what's right. Also the stocks are still rebounding.

5585 2018-03-09 03:35:41 March is the end of the fiscal year, so giving their stocks a bump and being able to show investors they have products for next year is a good plan.
5586 2018-03-09 03:34:47 98% of mass shootings happen in gun free zones. It's very obvious why. They could be in the 2% category, absolutely. Or we could just politicize it, complain about the NRA and ban bump stocks. Your imagined country with no guns does not exist and will not for a very long time.
5587 2018-03-09 03:34:45 Honestly super excited to buy stocks once I turn 18... and ski diving. Both of those give me such a rush just thinking about it.

5635 2018-03-09 03:14:24 Semi-automatic rifles are not the cause of mass shootings. It's the irresponsible modification of semi-automatic rifles that causes mass shootings (ie. bump stocks and oversized magazines).

5636 2018-03-09 03:13:51 if wont how will new people subscribe to pms business... any one can highlight how much portfolio down by in just 2 months any porinju clients>??? whats worse can you get exit if you need money now in those small penny cap stocks.....

5639 2018-03-09 03:13:28 Can be true if you are margined all in long on a huge drop but not if taking gains all along and stay under control long. Just playing the 200 day on the mkt and stocks long term win.

5642 2018-03-09 03:10:40 why arrow above ath? imo what this chart shows is exact -corr with dollar since jan. and the outlier is the current rising dollar over last week while stocks still rising. but stocks hitting res and dollar rising leads me to think that based on that corr that stocks r going down
5643 2018-03-09 03:08:44 Oh you have to it's brilliant, an investing platform to help people that don't know what they are doing...it rewards the top brokers and let's people give them more money/coins and are rewarded. Includes stocks as well. I wish I had heard of it a few months ago when dirt cheap
5644 2018-03-09 03:08:12 This could be year of the A group and large midcap stocks. Small caps may be sidelined. So stick to well known, very liquid stocks.

Consider LT finance, trent and voltas on dips. Market won't run away in March so IMO there's no rush.

5657 2018-03-09 02:57:24 @realDonaldTrump   If you ban bump stocks that opens the door to banning other items which could conceivably increase firepower. The answer is to have the BATF classify semi-auto weapons with a bump stock as automatic weapons.  That way just about everyone is happy.

5671 2018-03-09 02:51:12 Tax cuts are fine. Tax cuts that disproportionately favor the top 1% are ridiculous! Big corporations aren’t spending it on raising wages!! They’re buying back they’re own stocks!!!

5673 2018-03-09 02:50:44 And for the record, I’m generally a 2nd amendment supporter and republican but the fact that they can’t even discuss any alterations to gun laws like f’ing bump stocks or assault rifles shows they are as crazy as the far left.  #commonsense #rantover
5674 2018-03-09 02:46:56 Though the moment I read One Up On...enlightened me about investing, I used to not follow one aspect of 'holding so many stocks' in the PF like Peter Lynch did as I never held more than 5 stocks in my IN PF.

I'm finally following that & hold around 10 in my US portfolio.

5677 2018-03-09 02:45:12 Is DPW still halted on news?  I hope its good news for your sake. Those crypto related stocks like DPW are basically toxic.

5679 2018-03-09 02:43:49 Seriously... you are CNBC you must not know anything about markets. Do you yell all that FUD when apple or amazon stocks drop a few points? This must be just a dump intern running this.
5680 2018-03-09 02:43:12 Jobs up, unemployment down, stocks up, manufacturing coming back, steel, North Korea crying uncle! It's embarrassing for all past Presidents how well Trump is doing in his 1st year in government.
5681 2018-03-09 02:43:06 Also remember ,I am signing no bump stocks immediately......
5682 2018-03-09 02:41:34 What gun control laws? NRA doesn't allow bump stocks on their own ranges so I'm pretty sure they wouldn't be against a law against them. CDC has been doing research for a few years now with results gun controllers didn't exactly like. I've heard them. Have you?
5683 2018-03-09 02:41:24 Which I'm not down with. I'm holding my crypto, but my stocks aren't looking to much better. The crypto bull run is supposed to be underway any time... So I wait and see... I hope it does. I have 1000 shares of $DPW

5688 2018-03-09 02:38:29 At what point do you take the call that the original hypothesis for holding the stock has been violated? As stocks reaction precedes that realization. At times isn’t quitting a good thing in markets?
5689 2018-03-09 02:38:07 Always wondered why Peter Lynch favored holding diversified and tons of stocks unlike many other who believed in concentration.

Its not the diversification that drove his decisions but trying to own as many as high growth quality businesses as possible due to the availability.

5695 2018-03-09 02:33:52 Yet Trump still hasn't banned bump stocks, which he said he was doing "today"
5696 2018-03-09 02:33:43 so u think tariffs will work but u can't even consider that making laws to ban bump stocks and ARs won't work. Distractions 101
5697 2018-03-09 02:33:28 European stocks rose on Thursday as the ECB offered a brighter assessment of the euro-zone’s growth outlook after leaving its interest rates unchanged.
5698 2018-03-09 02:33:26 And bump stocks don't even matter.  I can bump fire a rifle from the shoulder, without any special stock.  The bump stock just doesn't hurt my shoulder as much to do it.

5725 2018-03-09 02:21:06 The President is going to ban bump stocks  The Better have the BATF classify a bump stock as an automatic weapons.That way the President is happy, the threat  to other weapons equipment is removed, and only those who like bump  stocks(which I imagine is very few) would be hurt.
5726 2018-03-09 02:20:47 Sorry @nra- Americans are actually educating themselves on the difference between a pistol, a semi-auto and an auto...and the bump stocks that make the difference obsolete.

5732 2018-03-09 02:18:51 @marcorubio ban bump stocks and assault rifles. Stop being a spokes person foe the NRA little Rubio
5733 2018-03-09 02:18:48 We are in good news is bad news bulls*it right now, I personally don’t think the number means too much, it’s the wage inflation that is the key, if it is higher than expected the 10 yr yield will rise and stocks will go down, that is what happened last month if everyone recalls.

5756 2018-03-09 02:01:14 $CEI Yikes! That’s the risk with these penny stocks. This recently went through a 1 for 25 reverse split (Monday) and has had strong bearish momentum ever since. Be careful with these

Mexico and Canada are now indefinitely exempt. And other countries are welcome to request exemption as well.

The guy who didn’t jack 3s, and stuck to transition buckets/putbacks, and got ~4 stocks a game would be a great “3rd star”-type (or backend 2nd).

5816 2018-03-09 01:18:57 No, but that's why I kind of like it. In a federal Bill Is be okay with 21 age limits getting rid of bump stocks for ccw reciprocity and arming school staff, cause I know the SC coming our way is going to get rid of the unconstitutional BS.

5842 2018-03-09 01:06:33 I honestly think it's more the NRA et al. are stretching the second amendment bit by bit.
 
30 yrs ago it was illegal to modify a semi auto to shoot fully auto. In the years since work arounds to this have been developed (i.e. bump stocks) and have been allowed to remain legal.
5843 2018-03-09 01:06:01 @realDonaldTrump please stop the gun control talk. An executive order on bump stocks is illegal and dangerous  It would ban simple aftermarket upgrades and improvements of many weapons.  Gun control bills S. 2095 and H.R. 5087 are unconstitutional. Stop them.

5848 2018-03-09 00:59:08 I'm not crazy about this particular Bill, but it was a semi decent compromise. In a federal Bill Id be okay with raising the age to 21 and giving up bump stocks for concealed carry reciprocity and arming school staff.
5849 2018-03-09 00:56:12 Look at liberal Massachusetts, the people refused to give up their bump stocks. They made a statement to the gov't, even with a maximum penalty of life in prision, we will not comply. How is a ban on so-called assualt weapons ban going to play out? Great majority going to ignore?

5882 2018-03-09 00:31:50 Stocks close higher as trade concerns ease.
5883 2018-03-09 00:31:41 Just control the guns:  ban military weapons, bump stocks, up the age limit, national registry.  I want safe kids everywhere not just schools!
5884 2018-03-09 00:31:35 How do you AVOID a losing #stock? Never buy on hope--if a stock's price can't beat the #SP500 index, stay away-- stay away from stocks that drop drastically aka #Gapdowns -- stay away from a late stage story #stockmarket #trading #investing #investments

5888 2018-03-09 00:27:41 Buy some coins and/or marijuana stocks with it
5889 2018-03-09 00:27:25 Just go out and grow some.  It is a weed you know!  And it doesn't NEED any of this crap corporate weed stocks are proclaiming.  Find 10-10,000 acres and grow it. Your costs will be the same as potatoes and your margins will be 80% more.  Even with just one crop.
5890 2018-03-09 00:27:23 Been thinking of getting into stocks for the environment 
5891 2018-03-09 00:26:10 World stock markets rise at news of #NKorea / #US meeting as traders eager for good news grab the possibility of peace profits. Defense stocks will fall. This news drowns out catastrophic tariff increases. Markets befuddled
5892 2018-03-09 00:25:59 #Stocks Doji candle’s change direction at the high point of the trend or the low point of the trend. Middle trend Doji are less likely to change trend direction.

5894 2018-03-09 00:25:43 Well he sold a majority of his stocks from optic so..
5895 2018-03-09 00:25:32 Never said that. Just pointing out that my state senator ONLY owns gun stocks.  Shes a gun profiteer. At least since she was elected.
5896 2018-03-09 00:24:17 i'm gonna ask my stamp supplier if they can finish a small order by next week! i feel guilty when someone asks for a stamp and i don't have stocks.. but please next time, anyone can shoot me a dm during PO period so i can take note ;u;
5897 2018-03-09 00:24:05 Ha! Trump has been excellent. You just can't accept reality. Economy flying, jobs growing, stocks up, taxes down. Now he has defeated NK with tweets. It's called winning! #MAGA
5898 2018-03-09 00:24:02 stocks tanking ,economists are warning of dangers to the economy—thanks largely to Trump.  Trump now imposes tariffs of 25% on all imported steel and 10% on all imported aluminum.
5899 2018-03-09 00:23:41 Donald Trump will meet with Kim Jung Un right after he signs his promised executive order on bump stocks.
Never. 

@CNN @MSNBC @maddow @jaketapper @chrislhayes @AC360
5900 2018-03-09 00:23:19 @realDonaldTrump bump-stocks are not the source of violence in this country. It is our morality. And bump-stocks are not machine guns, redefining terms jeopardizes our entire legal structure; including Article 1 Sect. 1 of the Constitution, the 2nd Amendment & the 10th Amendment.
5901 2018-03-09 00:22:21 What should be done is save up some capital ( money ) buy up when the economy tanks land, stocks etc most commodities then sell when market recovers rinse and repeat. Own assets like land pass it on to the next generation rinse and repeat
5902 2018-03-09 00:21:09 Are you saying that making money from an investment, that also had dramatic unintended consequences on humanity somehow invalidates one’s critique of the company? (See also: do you agree with all the values of the public co stocks you hold, even via funds?)
5903 2018-03-09 00:20:43 #Today like Whoa!! #politics #stocks
5904 2018-03-09 00:20:26 Because I remember, like yesterday, the power of Reagans tax cuts and the parabolic move higher in stocks, this time frame (with Trumps tax cuts) feels a bit like like deja vu. In my view, most have no idea how powerful the move higher could be.
5905 2018-03-09 00:18:54 Cramer is right for the most part. The wrong stocks are going up. Those being the highly shorted losers.
5906 2018-03-09 00:18:44 there are some stocks here you are
5907 2018-03-09 00:18:13 When the second amendment was written they used muzzle loaders. Common since gun control is needed. No reason for bump stocks or semi automatics. I own guns used to protect my farm and home. Background checks, mental health checks are needed.
5908 2018-03-09 00:18:08 @RicochetLord are u using Tim Alerts or Stocks 2 Trade?
5909 2018-03-09 00:17:00 Stocks will be up 1000th tomorrow
5910 2018-03-09 00:15:54 you wont find me commenting on stocks i dont own.
Leave them to it. They don’t need your useless input...
5911 2018-03-09 00:15:51 stocks are worse no actual certificate is ever issued and 100 people could own the exact same record of that purchase , its just a number that means nothing
5912 2018-03-09 00:15:34 @whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. Instead, let's push concealed carry reciprocity!
5913 2018-03-09 00:15:14 I've traded stocks on etrade for close to 20 years.
5914 2018-03-09 00:15:00 Thanks but I'd like him to protect my 2nd amendment rights first and that's not done by giving in to gun control like bump stocks that leads to more control of other things being control ed later and gun control is unconstitutional so no gun control please.
5915 2018-03-09 00:13:13 @JFreedlender what do u recommend more?  Stocks 2 trade or Tim Alerts?
5916 2018-03-09 00:13:12 Stocks with bullish MACD crossover today: $UNP $MRO $CELG $LVS $TIF $KSU $KBH $KBR $VMW $AN and $GS
5917 2018-03-09 00:13:03 champion link is a new character

he's like old link but with witchtime, a witchtime that triggers from aerial specials, has the canonical powers of the 4 champions, and arrows that vaporize stocks
5918 2018-03-09 00:11:51 You failed to mention that when Thatcher brought in the right to buy councils could not use the money to replenish housing stocks, it had to be used to keep council tax down to keep Tory voters happy
5919 2018-03-09 00:11:11 I doubt Kamui is offloading to exchanges. Smokescreen for a significant event much like trumps tariffs being a smokescreen for stocks. If he were to sell at exchange rates the added liquidity is positive. Effect on price is negligible. Secular Bull still intact
5920 2018-03-09 00:11:07 I own zero stocks but  I got $50 more a week in my paycheck #MAGA
5921 2018-03-09 00:10:43 if everyone runs to the redemption shed at the same time, watch money flee from gold pile in droves. 75% of all cash will invest itself in other stocks and commodities that actually move with more fun than that old hag market.
5922 2018-03-09 00:09:59 [BATCH 25]

For the 2nd box, I will update once finalized with supplier coz she told me na some sold out daw and some due to shortage ng stocks in SK kaya delay.

Will double check all items with her muna and see if kaya iship lahat or hindi due to stocks.
5923 2018-03-09 00:09:58 Hopefully Disney stocks will plunge.  It’s a very small person who cannot apologize for such despicable remarks.
5924 2018-03-09 00:09:22 I am confused. Didn't steel stocks RALLY on news of the tariffs?

Sterling recovers after hitting …
5926 2018-03-09 00:07:36 Asia stocks open higher following the positive lead from US where President Trump confirmed tariffs but exempted Canada and Mexico, while Trump was also said to be open to relief for its allies.
5927 2018-03-09 00:06:18 Knew that was coming. Didn’t take them long. 
By ‘British’ fish stocks, you mean predominantly Scottish fish stocks since the vast majority are in Scottish waters. And we didn’t even vote for this shitshow.

5928 2018-03-09 00:05:03 Decided I’m going to start investing in stocks.  Contribute.
5929 2018-03-09 00:04:44 Totally agree. Crypto and weed stocks. Like to see a lot less of that. @CNBCFastMoney
5930 2018-03-09 00:04:42 Yes indeed. We need an upset in production somewhere to remind markets that global stocks can't be taken for granted!
5931 2018-03-09 00:04:36 Yes, I was right in the first place to say its in the ASX 300! Which it is!

But U come and said, "No"
" it's in the All Ords"

Which I said same thing, They are in the top 300 ASX stocks of the All Ords 500 index 

Cheers
5932 2018-03-09 00:03:10 If they can ban bump stocks they can ban all stocks.  How long until they're trying to ban every accessory and piece of firearm furniture?

Those things jutting out of the steering column are STALKs, not STOCKs. #model3
