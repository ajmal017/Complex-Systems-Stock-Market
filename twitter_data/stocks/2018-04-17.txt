 "Gun" stocks were counting on Hillabeast's election for a nice 4thQ bump.
They took a big hit and started to tank when Trump was elected.
10 2018-04-17 23:48:57 Yes I read the article. Owning gun stocks has nothing to do with their success as a massive net positive in the world. Customers should absolutely hold even the best companies to the highest moral standard. Their success doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be pressured to do better.
11 2018-04-17 23:46:33 Neither BlackRock or Vanguard issue stocks so no. Maybe their AUM will increase though
12 2018-04-17 23:45:35 While we're at it, let's boycott the Florida teacher's union that owns over $500,000 of stock in American Outdoor Brands aka Smith & Wesson (AOBC) and other gun-related stocks.

15 2018-04-17 23:43:02 It just goes to show you how the market still has a few more weak hands to shake out. Companies report good earnings=stocks fall. Doesn’t make much sense other then people profit taking out of fear
16 2018-04-17 23:42:29 I don't like to put ceilings on stocks like this, just like I didn't want to on BYOC in the beginning....As more comes out and becomes public we should see a gradual increase in price. If the right filings and decent PR's are released I would expect a healthy move at least .05+
17 2018-04-17 23:42:17 OR maybe people who actually JOIN the #NRA do so because they couldn't pass universal background checks if implemented. Maybe BECAUSE they intend to use bump stocks on their AR15s and turn them on American Citizens!

Anyone agree?
77 2018-04-17 23:16:18 You have a well documented history of cheating contractors, employees, etc. You brag about cheating on your taxes. You continue to outsource labor. I honestly think that you're trying to extort stocks from Amazon with your factless attacks on how it hurts the economy.
78 2018-04-17 23:16:07 Firing squad with a battalion of shooters using machine guns with high speed magazines and bump stocks and silencers.
79 2018-04-17 23:15:25 Do you mean not correlated, or anti-correlated? If btc is a bet against the bank-dominated economy it may be anti-correlated. In fact right now gold and crypto rise while stocks fall.
80 2018-04-17 23:15:13 Stocks moving higher as the yield curve is in danger of inverting makes perfect sense when you realize it's par for this cycle for something to not make sense.

82 2018-04-17 23:14:55 Yawn. And as far as investing, gun stocks are about to make SERIOUS bank with Dems swooping in next election.
83 2018-04-17 23:14:46 Morgan Stanley and Vanguard. I can invest outside of my 401K with mutual bonds and my stocks. Just gotta set it up.
84 2018-04-17 23:14:42 Other than their one moral that diversification should be accessible and cheap, Vanguard is completely amoral. They pick stocks according to indexes they don’t control. This is laughable. They didn’t choose to include ANY particular equity in any ETF.
85 2018-04-17 23:14:01 @FoxBusiness no one wants a stock to drop (unless of course you're short) but to post $LUV is falling because of a tragedy is in poor taste to me. Stocks can come back..unfortunately the lost life won't- people know why it's dropping

87 2018-04-17 23:12:51 Bigger question is what does boycotting funds that buy stocks in the after market accomplish? They don’t finance the company, only the IPO does that. Want to hurt a business go after its cash source, its lenders. This is lazy symbolism.

Wisdom#2: No tax-paying entity should be getting refunds beyond what they pay in, because then it's no longer a refund. If it's happening, a law should be added/changed to fix it.
95 2018-04-17 23:08:11 Fair point.  I judge investors by their stocks and should judge Corbyn by the company he keeps.  How about "well intentioned but misguided?"  Many of the people around Corbyn are not the nicest characters.  My impression is that Corbyn does "want to do good" but I could be wrong.
96 2018-04-17 23:07:33 This is not aimed at you. Large corporations told Congress they would give extra money to their shareholders and buy back stocks; they will not be adding new jobs or building onto their businesses. We were lied to. That is what people are upset about.

135 2018-04-17 22:47:41 @DavidHogg111 you are not a financial adviser so you should not play one on recess go back to class like a good boy. Also I guarantee your handler #GeorgeSoros will by these stocks if they dip. You are such a tool.
136 2018-04-17 22:47:06 Would be stupid to declare stolen sarin if officially you have any stock. So not a fact rebels didn't have Assad's sarin, if stocks still exists informally...
137 2018-04-17 22:46:46 It's about that time to take some investment risks...
But how when you damn cheap & hate losing money? 

Cannabis stocks??
138 2018-04-17 22:46:27 Market Wrap-Up: stocks close higher for fourth straight day and S&P is overbought with a caution. QID closed lower and looking for support and CMCSA filled at both levels with revised sell. Please see "Open Traders Picks"
139 2018-04-17 22:44:07 Unspoken truths in melee

-4 stocks are not hype in 2018 Doesnt mean someone getting bopped. Sometimes it just happens, sojust carry on

-if someone 4 stock comebacks u, it counts as that person going up 10-0 on h2h stats

-if ur offstage and legit cant make it back, stop trying
140 2018-04-17 22:44:00 @Vanguard_Group You’re doing exactly what your supposed to be doing, owning all the stocks in the index.  Don’t change a thing.
141 2018-04-17 22:43:56 Well I'm probably not the one to ask but today folks decided they liked yield stocks (not all, most). 2/10 went to lower low
142 2018-04-17 22:43:19 individuals/ institutions, it's not just mut funds that own stocks. I'm saying active better lobby target if goal is pressure.

148 2018-04-17 22:39:06 There are days when I think we should bring back public stocks. I’d toss a couple of eggs at that sad excuse for a human.
149 2018-04-17 22:38:54 I hope our mighty President Trump can increase the Capital Loss Limitation against ordinary income of $3000 per year, that is the worst tax policy ever, many people stopped buying stocks after big losses and still haven't recoup the 2008 losses..
150 2018-04-17 22:37:18 Don't forget he fleeced all his investors in stock symbol DJT on wall street for nearly a decade.  He took extravagant salaries while the company never made a cent...During a time which stocks performed well and casino stocks performed excellent.   #WallStreetHatesTrumpStock
151 2018-04-17 22:36:53 Im all for love and solutions! Im not for mocking bullying gun violence scaring people going after Amazon than there stocks fall. Which hurt many in the company who invested etc. Many people need too grow up
152 2018-04-17 22:36:40 What stocks??

154 2018-04-17 22:35:52 I wonder if Southwest Airlines  will go out of business  and their stocks  will take a nose dive  after what has happened today.

157 2018-04-17 22:34:07 Too bad the Swiss central bank is a fiat ponzi king unto itself, buying US stocks with vapour
158 2018-04-17 22:34:00 Agreed! Both floats are pretty much locked. 
Stocks go up and when they go down, people get emotional and jump to conclusions.
159 2018-04-17 22:33:45 people get upset when there plans to sabotage perfectly good stocks don't go through...
160 2018-04-17 22:33:33 Well, not only that but they’re tracking indexes, mainly.  And gun companies’ stocks are in stock indexes...
161 2018-04-17 22:33:31 stocks today zzz.
162 2018-04-17 22:32:12 Because my companies stocks have increased this past fiscal half, I just made 9.5k i didn't have before.  Buy backs that pad the stock prices can also help out the employees.  Also my taxes are going down and my paycheck went up.
163 2018-04-17 22:31:43 The chart does look good imo. Trying to find some DD why this company may have a competitive advantage over others in the space
164 2018-04-17 22:31:13 Yes. I could also think of lots of additional people who should be put in stocks on O'Connell Street. :-)

170 2018-04-17 22:26:28 You do realize most people won’t purposely take gains right now on their funds, right? Investors don’t trade funds like stocks. Good luck with these choices.
171 2018-04-17 22:25:33 It's not his company. He has a not very senior position in Capital Management. He does not work on the investment side, so has no role in choosing stocks.

177 2018-04-17 22:23:14 So far, not much. @Vanguard_Group is taking more of a "let the politicians figure it out" stance publicly, while working privately to engage/change gun companies. But they can only do that so long as they're invested; which's why total divestment from gun stocks isn't 100% useful
178 2018-04-17 22:22:57 Ok stocks I’ll take that

192 2018-04-17 22:16:14 Someone needs to send him back to school to collect a few more wedgies. I’m guessing he probably doesn’t realize most of that isn’t Blackrock or Vanguard choosing to invest but just owned in street name for individuals who mostly own indexes that contain those stocks.
193 2018-04-17 22:15:28 Better stocks. Better tax code. America is safer. Border patrol has what they need. Why are you crying. Liberal joke
194 2018-04-17 22:15:18 He just mentioned Blackrock and Vanguard owning to many gun stocks. I have Vanguard
195 2018-04-17 22:14:24 But it wasn't true. My government stated that they have evidence that the stocks hadn't been destroyed

206 2018-04-17 22:10:01 Those 2 companies should pay you, David. Their stocks are about to jump thru the roof just like the NRA’s and Laura Ingraham’s did. It’s hilarious to watch you help the companies/people you hate. Keep it up!!!
207 2018-04-17 22:09:37 On the other hand, stocks with buybacks have under performed their peers.. this analysis also ignores stock issuance via options grants by the corps that are buying it back with the other hand
208 2018-04-17 22:09:27 I think they just mean no personal assets like stocks, bonds, 401K, etc., on the part of the borrower and don't need to prove their income w/a W2 (i.e. stated income). I was half joking, but it IS scary IF those products start to gain momentum...
209 2018-04-17 22:09:20 Is Ivanka telling people only wealthy white elites & corporations got a big tax break? Also, they're using those tax gains to buy back their stocks at inflated prices to make them appear they're worth more than they are--something that leads to higher prices for the middle class.
210 2018-04-17 22:09:06 I'm currently thinking about taking all funds out of FTSE as not too sure what will happen here. Although the GBPUSD is currently near long term highs so maybe a slight correction due which would be good for ftse stocks. Made about £5000 in forex this week so far. Happy days

215 2018-04-17 22:04:35 Don't you think it would make everyday people more apt to invest in stocks if government had less control? Profit isn't a dirty word and good companies that make more money & want to attract good employees, do invest that money back into their companies and employees.

219 2018-04-17 22:02:02 Putting together a decent month almost solely intraday & 1-2 day trades. Fair bit of that in fad/hype small caps.

228 2018-04-17 21:56:27 I gotta ask - and this is no disrespect to you - I've been following you and pot stocks for a little over 2 years (not much exp. I know), but it seems like most of them start to get quiet around May and stay down until fall. Do you not see that happening this go around?

234 2018-04-17 21:52:38 I was raised poor. When I started investing in stocks I was making $6.50/hr. But I did it anyway. 

Nowadays, with low fees and managed investments like ETFs, there are few people so poor or so clueless that they can't start building wealth. But most of them would rather whine.
235 2018-04-17 21:51:47 What’s the catalyst that we r looking for these Cannabis stocks?
236 2018-04-17 21:51:39 Win May canola down A$2.63/t & EU rape up A$2.65. Stronger C$ against US$ held canola back against gains in US soybns. US soyoil stocks lower than expected & palm oil higher. Record canola plantings still expected despite cold start to season.
237 2018-04-17 21:50:47 I agree. The government is morally bankrupt, it's only a matter of time before we are physically bankrupt. But hey on the bright side, after our illegal bombing of Syria, creators of mass murderer stocks have increased, expeditiously.
238 2018-04-17 21:50:40 Are their stocks gonna rise by 20% as well?

262 2018-04-17 21:39:44 Hey David, have you checked your parents' pension funds? Perhaps they should give back those gains from those gun maker stocks, and Vanguard & Blackrock funds?
263 2018-04-17 21:39:07 "...argues that more than 40% of all earnings growth between 2009 and 2017 was due to share buybacks... not actual profit". That's a bit staggering (if I understand it right).

267 2018-04-17 21:37:59 He also says "to date corporations have spent 37 times as much to buy back stocks as they are spending on workers’ one-time bonuses and wage hikes." I just don't see anything that says there has been absolutely no benefit to workers.
268 2018-04-17 21:36:31 Reading yesterday's tweet on the runaway prices 
of Top Domains (URL), there is one thing we should 
be disclosing :    Not all of them were  cash-deals. 
Some of them were cash and stocks in a Silicon
Valley startup company.
269 2018-04-17 21:36:10 Simple, drive the stocks down, then buy them on the cheap.  Then back off firearms companies, let the stock go back up and make millions.  Just like Obama and Soros did with coal.

Keep laughing.
278 2018-04-17 21:32:26 If already fully invested and even more leaders emerge, do you buy on margin and/or do you switch stocks? And if switch, which one do you sell first to finance a new buy?
279 2018-04-17 21:32:11 le mec a intérêt de faire des stocks .................
280 2018-04-17 21:32:01 Neither. Personally, I buy real stocks and real companies with real assets.
281 2018-04-17 21:31:48 LOL, I think they get paid by the NYSE to mention all the shitty stocks
282 2018-04-17 21:31:14 @davidhogg111 I just bought bought more stocks based on your recommendations.  I will fully support gun makers.
283 2018-04-17 21:30:55 For some it’s better but for most Americans it’s not...fat cats get s payday, companies are buying back stocks, less taxes are sugar rushing their earnings and most Americans can only buy an extra pizza. Typical conservative agenda favoring companies & the rich
284 2018-04-17 21:30:54 He also made a video supporting JBZY. I supposed he's pretty pissed off about the R/S. Any word on Fins? @xlogit3k
285 2018-04-17 21:30:52 Chryst should call and appease this guy. What’s it hurt? Grudges in business is never a good thing. Why limit yourself if all it takes is a phone call or having a beer with the guy?
286 2018-04-17 21:30:43 Sell to whom? I'm not disputing your reasoning. But assuming these stocks aren't zeroes, someone is holding them, which means these actives are selling to other actives.
287 2018-04-17 21:30:09 Money lost. Sell stocks.
288 2018-04-17 21:29:26 no tbh. Have been focusing on something other than stocks for a while now
289 2018-04-17 21:29:07 I know I am. This dude will make these stocks skyrocket.
290 2018-04-17 21:29:02 A manufacturing company.  The owner doesn't increase the pay when he gets a tax break, he doesn't hire more people.  What does he do?  Buy new cars, and more stocks and equipment that will help put more workers out of WORK!  Stop buying in to the BS. Trickle down doesn't work!
291 2018-04-17 21:28:50 BlackRock and Vanguard are the biggest asset managers in the world and run tons of index funds. By to the rules they must own the shares in the index. If you want change, talk to the indexers that include these stocks or active managers that pick them. There's a difference.
292 2018-04-17 21:28:43 That’s exactly WHY he shouldn’t have just GIVEN a big tax Most of them are simply using the tax break to buy back stocks. He should have given them as incentive, with condition, like , say providing health insurance, passing a percentage on to employee salary raises, ect.

299 2018-04-17 21:24:33 @RepKevinBrady  why do we have to wait until next year.The Big Corp didn’t have to wait until next year  to get their tax breaks. And most of them are not giving anything to help their employees, only buying back stocks!!!that was all BULLSHIT YOU DAMN LIARS
300 2018-04-17 21:23:53 And what words of wisdom do you have for those who barely pay anything towards taxes but get nice fat refunds that far exceed what little they put in?
301 2018-04-17 21:23:18 Stocks going back up!!!!
302 2018-04-17 21:23:10 Note to self.  Buy up stocks in tiki torches
303 2018-04-17 21:21:36 Learn young (I didn't) that assets > income.  Assets are taxed way more favorably. live frugal and pour every dollar into real estate or stocks or businesses and you can beat the system. 

Make $200k in a year and you really make $100k, counting local taxes. It's brutal.
304 2018-04-17 21:21:11 Fun thing about people who pretend #UraniumOne is a scandal. They say that Clinton “sold US’s uranium” due to the company being bought by russians.

Uranium One is Canadian, and sold stocks to a russian company. 
By their logic, it was Canada’s uranium, as they owned the company

320 2018-04-17 21:08:42 Of course the wealthy own more stocks. Their stocks are part of their wealth. But with fees as low as $4.95 / trade and plenty of good companies trading at < $10.00 / share, almost anyone can become an equity investor. If they choose not to, fine. But why vilify those who do?
321 2018-04-17 21:08:25 With the $SPY closing above its 50 day we can now start to look towards the long side.  Look for growth sectors to move if we can hold the 2700 level.  Earning season can serve as a catalyst for lackluster stocks so pay close attention to post earning reactions.   Ease back in

325 2018-04-17 21:07:11 Don't get me wrong, we should ban assault weapons, have background  checks and vote out Rubio, Scott, Trump and all NRA puppets.  For financial pressure, go after the gun cos' banks, customers, etc.

But index funds contractually must own stocks in the index. It's the wrong fight

333 2018-04-17 21:03:23 Its more complicated than just selling stocks for these companies.  A lot of arms manufacturers are part of index funds:ETFs, and only at small percentages of a much larger fund for each.  divesting those products with many different customers & managers would be a logistics mess

Stuff defence analysts can tell though - was projectile dropped from air etc. US claims blood and urine shows sarin, a different matter.

Tapper’s wife works 4 Planned Parenthood

CNN’s VP married to Obama’s Deputy Secretary

ABC’s Claire Shipman is Jay Carney’s wife

Corey Booker gave Jeff Zucker MILLIONS in stocks for his kid

CBS News Pres is Ben Rhodes’ brother
431 2018-04-17 20:20:18 That's because they run "passive" index funds that own all the stocks in a given index.  For example, an S&P 500 fund by definition owns all stocks in the S&P 500.   No amount of protesting will change this.

I'm very sympathetic to your cause, but this may be the wrong battle.
432 2018-04-17 20:19:59 Whadda u think about Ryan Bertrand? Would give Robbo competition, add experience to our relatively young full back stocks, would be cheap (you know, cuz he is too good to be in the championship) and keep the memes coming
433 2018-04-17 20:19:40 Calling all investors! If prior “boycotts” are any indication- their stocks are about to rise!!!
434 2018-04-17 20:19:11 World stocks rally: US +1.1%; Europe +.8%. As investors attention shifted to earnings rather than trade, politics or inflation, they saw a great quarter & bought. Volatility - up or down - will be intrinsic to the market for some time. 2018 likely to end up in mid-single digits.

580 2018-04-17 19:08:17 We don't have any ready stocks now in India. We normally don't import, clear, stock and sale. Prices being erratic and considering the transit time it is very difficult to mitigate the risks involved and also currency risk. However some times we do sell on high seas sales.

638 2018-04-17 18:39:47 Ok but where to find such stocks
639 2018-04-17 18:39:46 you missed my point. Dividends often appreciate.  They've done this for decades.  Are your dividends appreciating faster than they have historically before the tax plan.  The answer is no.  Stocks have gone down. Whatever dividend gain you've seen has been mostly negated
640 2018-04-17 18:37:33 We are supply garments stocks

645 2018-04-17 18:35:23 I’ve always been firmly in the mindset of open and enjoy. Toys are for playing with. If you purchase collectable figures as an investment you really should invest in stocks. Much better return. I know I’m in the minority’s these days tho lol!

664 2018-04-17 18:28:02 What is MSE stocks?
665 2018-04-17 18:26:44 LATE NIGHT THOUGHT

Is it better to build a portfolio (40%) of MSE stocks?

Such stocks are illiquid and are largely unaffected by market falls.

Most return 30% to 200% in 12 months, provided you play it smart.

I think it's a good idea.

722 2018-04-17 17:59:13 What shareholders got bailed out? They all got diluted. If you mean that stocks benefited from the govt not allowing a second great depression, that's a really weak argument.

723 2018-04-17 17:58:58 My lord are people stupid. The stock market going up is BAD. The goal in financial leading is to maximize owners profits or the value of the enterprise. That's exactly what they did - they bought back stocks and gave out dividends so their stockholders would remain there.

734 2018-04-17 17:54:08 Many are talking about individual stocks . But i believe investing behaviour decides how big you can make in the market. Catching tailwinds or momentum will earn you nothing as compared to staying patiently doing nothing for a long period of time.

747 2018-04-17 17:46:49 What leads to inflation, then? Inflation isn't arbitrary - it's influenced by all those factors that you've mentioned. 

Investing in stocks isn't to beat inflation, at least to my mind. It's to outcompete returns on other asset classes thereby increasing "net purchasing power".

775 2018-04-17 17:32:27 "If owning stocks is a long-term project for you, following their changes constantly is a very, very bad idea. It's the worst possible thing you can do." @jasonzweigwsj

801 2018-04-17 17:24:33 C'est les stocks du tribunal des flagrant délires?
802 2018-04-17 17:24:33 So many promises for what will happen when w re supposed to see these things already. 

Meanwhile, corporations are using their tax cuts to buy back stocks, @GOP has added another $1.5 trillion to the national debts, and out annual deficit is back over a trillion per her
803 2018-04-17 17:24:26 Dow is down since Jan 1, 2018.  Do you even own stocks or pay taxes?

82% of the tax benefits went to the top 1 percent and corporations. Tax cuts shrink even further in time for avg person.

Wages are still stagnant. unemployment rate is the same
804 2018-04-17 17:23:29 OPEX week:
we want oil up
stocks up
bonds up
and volatility to crash to 0
805 2018-04-17 17:23:19 Corporations are buying back their stock. Experts say if it continues, there will be no stock market. Retirement plans own the majority of stocks. Retirement plans will suffer
806 2018-04-17 17:23:13 ,,long term security and stability'' nobody signs contracts for a couple of months .. and at CCJ still nothing and US productions is right now close to  ZERO ... and i don't see a strong selloff in uranium stocks today ..
807 2018-04-17 17:22:31 @germanrlopez so I just read a article you wrote saying that bump stocks make weapons automatic? Your joking right? I mean I hope you took atleast 2 minutes to do research.. if u did you realize how dumb you look
808 2018-04-17 17:21:57 Some IT stocks are exception... But many TV only experts advise those stocks as risk and out of favour stocks.. The same guys will later come back and advise to invest once it reaches 25x PE rating. If it goes down they will say I told you so. Who cares.

810 2018-04-17 17:20:22 Stocks
811 2018-04-17 17:20:04 Only 3 things matter in the stock market:
1) Liquidity; i.e. buying power in any form such as QE, corporate buy backs, option flow etc. Without it markets will fall
2) Economy = Earnings. A strong economy = strong earnings = higher stocks
3) Sentiment. Tracks both but is delayed
812 2018-04-17 17:19:45 BS. Corporations are using it to buy back their stocks not invest in workers or communities
813 2018-04-17 17:19:22 Stocks pause, bonds rip.  What a layup for the bond bulls, underlying bid ZB all day

831 2018-04-17 17:10:45 That really seems to bother you a lot. The companies may have bought back stocks to including ownership consolidation, undervaluation, and boosting financial ratios.

1051 2018-04-17 15:35:11 In my personal opinion, stocks like Netflix and Amazon are exceptions, not rules, so I just kind of find them interesting to study.  However, I don't think they represent a new paradigm as far as valuations go.  That being said, I wouldn't bet against them, either.

1093 2018-04-17 15:22:43 The tax scam bill only benefits the white wealthy elites. They're using their tax gains to buy back their own stocks & artificially boost the market. That's a key component of inflation. The middle class will only see higher prices & higher sales tax.

1121 2018-04-17 15:08:50 Just exactly do they think it will accomplish...It ain the gun its the person holding the gun. Also the AR 15 is a semi auto rifle and since bump stocks are no longer legal it the same as a 22 rifle. F"ed up shit.
1122 2018-04-17 15:08:20 Investing in your future. Look for stocks, or funds that sell at a discount and have a history of paying and or increasing dividends. I encourage reinvesting all dividends when share price is discounted. Compound interest is your friend. Protect assets, consider a trust fund.
1123 2018-04-17 15:08:19 Well given that your panel is fraud and shorting stocks, maybe you can ask an expert like Fraser.  Who paid him?  When did he receive the CTS report?  When did he setup his cancelled CNBC appearance?

1164 2018-04-17 14:54:34 The popular averages usually mislead investors from seeing key leaders emerge. When you focus on the market as your lead indicator (instead of individual stocks) you almost always miss a good number of key stocks. Why? Because leaders lead the market.
1165 2018-04-17 14:53:33 How about an easing of trade and geopolitical tensions, a NAFTA agreement $/JPY to 115 again, a pause in rate hikes... not saying it is definitive but there are plenty of levers to "pump" stocks higher again.

1172 2018-04-17 14:51:28 $$$ speak for themselves. Obviously, you don't pay much attention to the stocks I put out there every week. Right means making money. Sorry you are missing out. Others aren't, and are very happy! GL on SX, you are going to need it!
1173 2018-04-17 14:50:49 That's why you check the news on something if you're putting stocks into it

Back to paying over inflated prices on US brand goods.

1200 2018-04-17 14:41:49 If you believe as many do that Congress stole the Social Security trust funds, then you must also believe there is no money in any private pension fund because its assets are invested in stocks and bonds.

1206 2018-04-17 14:40:22 Old logo both times. Perhaps they're using up stocks of the vinyls?

And, more seriously, you're right - it is always disappointing when route branded buses go out on the wrong routes. If you can't get it right reliably, far better not to have route branded buses at all, I think.

1210 2018-04-17 14:37:20 Because to make real profits on stocks, it most often requires shitloads of money. Unless you invest in IPO's or have invested in tech companies, it doesn't really pay off with smaller amounts of money.

I believe 10-12 stocks should be max.

1238 2018-04-17 14:21:41 The long end is rallying along with stocks.  They won't be denied.
1239 2018-04-17 14:21:11 How is that different from all Chelsea sacking or Barca sacking, or LVG sacking and so on. Managers get sacked, whether young of experienced. The board just want big name signing to fuel the man united stocks and make profit.
1240 2018-04-17 14:21:04 He wants universal background checks for all gun purchasers, a ban on high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, and military-grade assault weapons. He doesn’t want to take away handguns or shotguns that are used to protect yourself.

1256 2018-04-17 14:13:49 You're trying to deflect again. Your GOP Middle Class Tax Rape is only good for the top 1%. Any relief for middle class families is temporary & fleeting.
Wages are stagnant & big corps are only buying back their own stocks & paying out dividends benefiting mostly Foreigners.

1334 2018-04-17 13:40:49 Liberal don’t believe in crooked government. Last year, Congress cut corporate taxes by $1 trillion. Corporations passed on 5% of the tax cuts to the American workers. The rest went to buy back stocks and pay dividends. That was crooked but it wasn’t liberal.

"Tax cut scoreboard: Workers $6 billion; Shareholders $171 billion"

1368 2018-04-17 13:26:42 Volatility rocked global markets in February after a prolonged calm in 2017, roiling stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities, and remained elevated through the end of March, helping Goldman book gains in both equity and bond trading in the first quarter.

1427 2018-04-17 12:59:48 Other then the wealthiest in the country, who are these tax cuts helping? What do the wealthiest do with what they save? They buy back stocks, artificially inflating their true worth.  They set yet another record on political contributions, or they park it in savings...

1472 2018-04-17 12:38:33 How so? My understanding is that it is going to be nearly impossible to dramatically change the size of the pie, other than a few stocks here and there. So there’s two choices: making fairer slices for smaller producers; or a smaller pie (caused by overfishing).

1482 2018-04-17 12:33:22 @WWFSouthAfrica  You haven't a clue when it comes to Elephant conservation - burning stocks of ivory keeps the price high and makes it profitable for poachers. Sell all the stocks, depress the price - no incentive to poach. GET REAL!

1484 2018-04-17 12:31:46 The consensus now is the Fed hiking rates for the 7th-10th time will have no impact on inflation. Why? Because we still want stocks to go higher
1485 2018-04-17 12:31:41 @WarrenIngram with going 70% stocks and 30% crypto it's now fair that even a R5000 monthly contribution to respective investment vehicles can compare with Julia returns. R3500 stocks R1500 crypto can grow big. Risk + normal

1567 2018-04-17 11:32:15 Those buybacks are keeping the cost of stocks artificially high.  Eventually, they won't be able to continue to buy back their own stocks and the only way they'll be able to go then is down.

“Gender, gender, money, oil, gender....wanna buy some stocks?” Lol.
2038 2018-04-17 05:02:12 Since Trump won the election the stock market has climbed to record highs. That is a fact. This doesn’t mean everyone makes money in the stock market. Overall stocks go up because Trump is good for biz.
2039 2018-04-17 05:01:01 I do not track mid cap and small cap stocks.
2040 2018-04-17 05:00:39 It has already shot up from 8500 to 9200. Crude prices are high and that is negative for Auto stocks.
2041 2018-04-17 04:59:16 How soooo ? How is Crypto any different from capital gains on stocks ? Not understanding your point. We get taxed on our personal income too. We get taxed when we buy consumers/durable  goods again . Respectfully,  what is your point ?
2042 2018-04-17 04:58:42 Utdelningar inom stocks and shares ISA är helt skattefritt. Annars är utdelningar skattefritt till 11k pund årligen har jag för mig.

2044 2018-04-17 04:55:57 Seeing Twitter's effect on Royal Orchid. Can tweets on hotel stocks from @Gautam__Baid @safiranand @dhavalp yesterday influence them so significantly? :)
2045 2018-04-17 04:54:53 I have noticed on tv you have talked up a possible switch from growth stocks into asx top 20 dogs. Are you personally doing some of this rotation or is this just your prediction on what the market will be doing?
I struggle with the thought of selling my APX & CSL for TLS & AMP
2046 2018-04-17 04:53:59 Haha..That's what I thought so, but you never know about ADAG stocks 
2047 2018-04-17 04:53:30 They can't admit something is wrong. If they do their stocks will drop even further.
2048 2018-04-17 04:52:42 What you say is not true. It is easy to make stuff like bump stocks with my belt. There are multiple modifications you can do easily by looking it on the internet. Also, you may want to look at your second sentence I don't really understand it.

2052 2018-04-17 04:43:31 Diversification Or Di(WORSE)ification? The basic premise of diversification is to reduce the risk. Just adding more and more stocks in the portfolio will not eliminate the risk. #EquityEducation #EquityPower #StockMarket

2054 2018-04-17 04:41:28 Global Markets: Asia stocks edge up on steady China GDP, earnings in focus: TOKYO (Reuters) - Asia stocks rose modestly on Tuesday following data showing China's economy grew a little faster than expected in the first quarter.
2055 2018-04-17 04:40:17 Dear God people, embrace the mutual fund!
You don't really need 57 separate stocks. Put them all in a mutual fund PLEASE!!
2056 2018-04-17 04:39:06 So what is the problem with lowering the fraction? What is the problem with raising the age to access to 21? Can't drink before 21 in USA, why own a gun before then? What is the issue with banning the AR15 and bump stocks? Why does a citizen need the same weaponry as military?
2057 2018-04-17 04:38:05 True No recurrent cost, only the replenishing one. Just like Trump wrote off few days ago $130 million Tomahawk firework display on Syria. Many observers called it finishing USN old stocks to give space to the new ones. Happy news for Hughes and Raytheon, more orders.

2071 2018-04-17 04:26:11 Bank Nifty at 25350 is at inflection point.  Unless it gets past 25500 it would be difficult to sustain at current level.  Most stocks of BN are range bound and volumes are not encouraging.  Sell at 25400 with SL and target 25250 for the day
2072 2018-04-17 04:26:08 You've made good changes so far. WA banned bump stocks, devices that effectively let semiautomatic weapons function like fully automatic ones. Cincinnati, OH, wants to do the same. IL is trying to pass a criminal background checks for all gun shop employees and more. Good job.
2073 2018-04-17 04:25:01 Think about this for next time.  I can own tobacco stocks, stocks in companies that provide nicotine replacement, stocks in pharmaceutical companies that make lung cancer drugs, stocks in the hospital & buy a funeral home.

2081 2018-04-17 04:15:10 The huge wealth gap between 1% and the rest is only going to get worse; the amount saved for lower income is nothing compared to business/high income; the deficit/debt will sky rocket; companies are mostly using the $ to buy back stocks; the personal tax cuts expire...

2159 2018-04-17 03:04:07 Promoters have dubious records in compliance.  Sebi fined for manipulating stocks.  Income tax fines and Mandi tax evasion clearly shows what kind of promoters.

2166 2018-04-17 02:58:38 Pretty premature the #TaxScam has not provide anything. Auto sales are declining layoffs coming. Big Banks just reported there stocks all went down, not enough business. The CBO reports predicts 1.9 GDP for next 10 years. And not the 3-4 GDP Repub's claimed it would be.

2176 2018-04-17 02:54:54 Whole market etfs. I might rebalance a little more to or away from int’l stocks depending on my interpretation of the cycle and economics. 
I’m bad at timing, bad at picking stocks, and probably bad at calling macro econ trends so I monkey with allocation % as little as possible.

2179 2018-04-17 02:50:44 Nope. Corporate America is not
creating jobs, they are investing their new given tax breaks to invest in stocks and make more money. TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS IS A FARCE.
2180 2018-04-17 02:50:13 Heartening to read on a 97 percent monsoon. Not just for economy or stocks- more for the absence of a winter this year. Would love to see showers and lots of green

2205 2018-04-17 02:30:17 It depends on where the money comes from.

Whose money is going into the stocks?

2208 2018-04-17 02:28:59 Why wouldn't they? They lose nothing if people buy stocks they already hold, or sell stocks they've shorted. And there are small investors I've followed who don't do this for a living but are both generous and insightful.
2209 2018-04-17 02:28:31 Is this true? Out of all the stocks why would Dalal Street recommend something which is okish and free float close to Mt. Everest?
2210 2018-04-17 02:26:15 Traders should take comfort, with Most Stocks, that we Shouldn’t experience a Huge Selloff! Too Close to Earnings! #MarketTimer

2212 2018-04-17 02:26:04 As far as guns themselves are concerned, yes, I do think we need to look into certain weapons such as an AR-15 and why it’s such a common choice for mass shooters.  I think high capacity magazines, accessories like bump stocks, and legal age to purchase should also be addressed.

(And who do you think I'm talking about?)
2246 2018-04-17 01:57:39 Funnily enough, I absolutely hated stocks since Feb'16, completely manipulated to the upside when the fundamentals said the opposite and still do. That said, if you follow the big picture from the Fed, it appears to be the most predictable. TBD.
2247 2018-04-17 01:57:27 I never understood why do investors have to look industries which have disruptions not from home country. India is. Large country and there are many listed stocks which are non linear and dependent on external factors. Ride your puts locally.
2248 2018-04-17 01:57:18 Asia #stocks edged higher on Tuesday, tracking Wall Street gains as the focus shifted to corporate earnings and looming economic data from #China amid signs Western-led strikes on #Syria weren't likely to escalate.
2249 2018-04-17 01:55:22 Hay fuerte stocks en toda la cadena retail ya que el consumo q proyectaron no se está dando. La baja de tasas es en cierta forma (errónea para mí) para fomentar ese consumo y cerrar el gap. La única forma q hace crecer el consumo es bajando inflación. No queda otra.

2268 2018-04-17 01:42:23 Sure there's a strategy - overthrow Assad, create a failed state, let ISIS take over, wait for ISIS to strike the US, declare another "war on terror," invade a country that had nothing to do with it, create another failed state, sell stocks in Lockheed, make tons of money, etc.
2269 2018-04-17 01:42:10 It's pretty well known that the Australian V8 Super Cars are essentially a stock car series. Much like Sports Cars under the IMSA fold. They aren't street stocks, but they aren't Indy, DP, or F1 type cars.

2271 2018-04-17 01:39:30 The good news is that soon we'll have a real president who'll return our tax money while making the multi-billion-dollar international companies pay their fair share, rather than seeing our money disappear from our country altogether as they buy back their stocks.

2279 2018-04-17 01:30:38 Well to be fair the GOP didn't say that they were going to do it. Trump did and he could have just as easily just sign it into law with an executive order. But I'm not for bump stocks I don't think they are necessary. To be honest I barely support ARS.

2301 2018-04-17 01:12:14 Looking back a year from now, I never would have expected to already be working for myself in a way that could provide sufficient income for years down the road. Trading stocks for my own gain sounds much nicer than consulting people about financial advice.

2304 2018-04-17 01:10:21 Most Americans haven’t seen a dime of these so called tax cuts - companies used the money to buy back stocks and give to CEOs like yourself  @IvankaTrump
2305 2018-04-17 01:09:46 The CBO now reports hat 80% of all the economic gains from Trump's tax cuts will go to nations other than the US.

50% of US stocks are owned by non-US citizens.  Another bulk of the companies receiving the tax breaks are non-American companies.

2307 2018-04-17 01:08:09 Too much comment on launch platforms. The main problem is very low stocks of missiles (in fact any sort of ammunition). Storm Shadow is an exception, where we have the missiles and could soon have a gap in qualified aircraft
2308 2018-04-17 01:06:38 The real problem is the stocks are overvalued and we are in a correction.  Would be the situation with or without news.  News provides convenient cover for large sell offs.

2311 2018-04-17 01:05:59 Great decision the Kroger Company made, unlike other major companies that touted bonuses, hiring, expansion plans from 2-3 yrs ago - while laying off workers and buying back stocks. The tax law is still a terrible mistake, but good on Kroger to do right and invest in themselves.

2313 2018-04-17 01:02:49 John. A correction hasnt begun. It is incredibly overvalued.  When local incomes and wages are stagnant. Only one way for prices to go.   Down.  Bank stocks will follow as mortgages dry up. @kt52545265 @StephenPunwasi

2319 2018-04-17 00:55:04 Not entirely true Mr President,for those that own Stocks and bonds it is still very complicated and requires aCPA to complete the return.
2320 2018-04-17 00:54:46 Meanwhile @SCHEELS will continue to display assault weapons with bump stocks prominently at the entrance to their guns departments.

Boycott Scheels for cycling gear, athletic gear, golf gear, camping gear, and all else, and leave them to be a gun store only with a Ferris wheel.
2321 2018-04-17 00:52:23 Where have you been?  I think in another world.  Not on earth that's for sure!  Let me update you with the latest.  Ever since Trump became president things have been improving: the stocks, the security of our nation, jobs, the economy.  The Chinese aren't screwing us in the ass.

2325 2018-04-17 00:48:43 I mean I agree that the news may have made xvg start to rise, but what does that have to do with anything? You think stocks or currencies just move based on your chart TA? Your chart TA is simply a map of market sentiment, which news has a part of...charts are money movement

2334 2018-04-17 00:39:20 I told Sean Broderick that I’m glad I didn’t start in 2015 . First   U308 stocks last summer. Long 2018 winter dip. Today was a good day. 
2335 2018-04-17 00:38:10 It has nothing to do with the decisions Trump has made. Notice how my sources or yours haven't touched 2018 yet? Ok so now that we're talking about Trump's economy, he's adding to the deficit with his tax plan and the stocks took a yuge 700 point drop with the China trade wars.
2336 2018-04-17 00:36:02 "Many people are pessimistic with their words but optimistic with their actions. If you say the world is going to hell but still invest in stocks, the latter is probably a more genuine feeling.""
2337 2018-04-17 00:35:05 NO. But I am not one-sided. I get why they do it. They care about their retirement and personal future. In one year, stocks have doubled under Trump, especially after that fucked up tax bill the Republicans passed. My stuff on eBay is selling way faster in the last 6-months.

2347 2018-04-17 00:26:58 If they wanted to, the GOP could pass legislation banning bump stocks easily. They’re not, in hopes of drawing out the process so that, if/when people forget, they can forget the regulations.
2348 2018-04-17 00:25:31 So let me clue you in. What the GOP is doing is taking the most time they can to regulate bump stocks. They’re hoping that, if they can convince people they’re working on it, we’ll stop checking on it, and they’ll be able to drop the regulation.

2. Learn how to manage a couple stocks at a time and stick to your trading plan. Only going to be a handful of stocks in play for the day. Focus on them!

2357 2018-04-17 00:19:08 Obama reversed bump stocks but I think that supposedly Trump is already putting bump stock to the fire. But I guess we will see and I wouldn't be opposed to or the removal of bump stocks

2361 2018-04-17 00:17:03 Hi. Are you seriously that out of touch? 50% of the US is paying taxes and has a pension fund paid for by the stock market. Stocks have gone up 500% in the last decade. So, someone who had $50K now has $250K. People are willing to look beyond the racism and bullshit to make $$$.

2369 2018-04-17 00:08:51 I'm happy for these people. And I'm tired of you ignoring all the analyses which show most of the benefit of the ill-conceived tax cuts are going to corporations, who do stock buybacks and dividend increases (and have you seen the percentage of non-American holders of US stocks)?
2370 2018-04-17 00:07:36 Nice after hours close on $EBIO at 1.60.  Holding stocks that trade a/h has me sitting at my computer until 8pm. Its why i mostly swing OTC stocks overnight.

2372 2018-04-17 00:05:57 2/ Think of investing in stocks like planting a tree. You can’t yell at it to grow faster, something analysts stupidly do. With time, sun, and water, that little sapling will become a tree. Successful investing requires patience and a strong stomach.
