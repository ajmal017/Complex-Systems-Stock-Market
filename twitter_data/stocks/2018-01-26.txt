133 2018-01-28 22:24:33 But more to that point is that Trump managed to unleash America's economic engine from the worst of Obama's job-killing micro-management and things are kicking into high gear!  Stocks have been on a record tear anticipating this, and wages are climbing significantly.
134 2018-01-28 22:23:57 Crypto market cap got a lot more coins than all forex pairs or stock market shares, anyone can invest in crypto unlike in forex or stocks. Your analysis doesn't take in consideration a lot of variables. Basically it seems good for a comparison but lacks too much things.
135 2018-01-28 22:23:03 I think Motif is interesting, but I think reason hard for them to compete with ETFs is advisors totally prefer SEC-approved, 40 Act funds when it comes to a basket of stocks.
136 2018-01-28 22:22:22 SD, I haven't set up crypto accounts yet but I applied for margin account to start sorting stocks that I haven't done before. I'm still evaluating my Crypto options because of my current work load. Thank you for following up. All the best for coming week.
137 2018-01-28 22:21:46 That's a good thing because most average American can't do due diligence for stocks in the stock market let alone a start up. So if this was the case, the amount of fraud that would be committed
138 2018-01-28 22:20:36 You have to buy and then sell the same amount at the market price. 
You pay the spread at the market maker to do money laundering or tape painting.
Net sum must be = 0. If i'm only buying splitting my order in small tranches that's not wash trading and is legit also on stocks.
139 2018-01-28 22:20:00 Last week was the 10th week in a row that S&P Futures had broken the previous week's high. This sequence last extended to 11 weeks on 2 March 2012, 309 weeks ago (when the run lasted for 11 weeks) #stocks
140 2018-01-28 22:19:36 I'm sure Dems want it boycotted! Stocks up, 401ks, retirement soaring, economy, GDP3%, gangs out, jobs, bonuses!
141 2018-01-28 22:19:25 it was originally intended for stocks and etfs, back when the crypto markets you see today were just a gleam in daddy's eye. $SPY = S and P 500 . owning $SPY put options is a short position (betting it goes down).
142 2018-01-28 22:19:17 Where the women that’s into stocks?
143 2018-01-28 22:19:02 Hope you enjoyed the game!  All the best with everything

145 2018-01-28 22:18:11 Here’s an idea, stock screening normally involves a bottom up approach so u risk finding stocks in poor sectors. What if we add a top down approach and weight against the stock? Ie Utilities -1 pt due to political risk etc @traderdiarycouk @InvestedGeordie

147 2018-01-28 22:17:49 You understand those record high can only be happeneing BECAUSE of the previous admin right? The stocks tripled under obama and put them up to where they are today. The economy was literally spiraling downward after the bush admin and obama saved it and passed it to trump
148 2018-01-28 22:16:12 What percentage of Americans own stocks?
149 2018-01-28 22:15:17 The actual changed MGL makes it quite clear that a green card allows you to possess bump stocks - while not being able to obtain a green card because of bump stock possession, it is clear by having a green does allow possession of a bump stock. EOPS is either lying or inept.

153 2018-01-28 22:11:40 Patience young man... these things take time... do you invest regularly?  Nothing goes up continuously bud... price has to reset, find a higher base line support level and then increase again... happens with stocks, forex, crypto, gold, silver, oil etc. another spike will come

158 2018-01-28 22:06:58 Not really, essentially it’s about the same. The problem is, you want an accessory banned. It is a wedge issue. Get bump-stocks banned, then magazine size, mounts and so on.
159 2018-01-28 22:06:00 I will buy them after they announce on Friday. Stocks go up and down in short term. I would hold them for at lest 3-5 years or longer to maximize my profits. Good luck!
160 2018-01-28 22:05:00 The Dow has rallied for 17 of the last 20 weeks, adding a total of 4819 points (+22.1%), making this the biggest 20 week gain seen in the 426 weeks since 27 November 2009 #stocks
161 2018-01-28 22:04:40 I guess he’s talking about the Wall Street fat cats and Corporate shareholders! Most Americans don’t hold stocks ,and wages for Working Americans are stagnant!

I don't have any tire company stocks so I'm good either way.

171 2018-01-28 21:57:44 As far as stocks, frack stocks, means nothing to average American, since 1% own most of them. 401Ks were  scam on the American Worker, and should be eliminated or backed up by the government, & bailed out when crooks from Wall Street crash the market, instead of bailing WStreet!
172 2018-01-28 21:56:46 Maybe some stocks are up but more people getting laid off. Economy sucks

178 2018-01-28 21:52:38 Instead you duped the poor, crashed the economy, gave the money back to the banks where they bought the stocks back for 25 percent of value.

183 2018-01-28 21:46:48 Not really. He's entirely holding equity, and his "net worth" (and income) is based on the idea that he can take other rich people's money by selling his stocks. A major sell-off would crash the stock price of AMZN. He owns fake money, basically.
184 2018-01-28 21:46:24 Trump, as long as stocks hold over a certain line.... Is one of the best nationalist presidents this country has produced.
185 2018-01-28 21:45:15 With the market and most stocks being significantly above the 200 dma, do you tighten up stops and exit signals more than you would typically or stay true to your process of using the 200 dma? Thanks
186 2018-01-28 21:45:02 Everyone keeps arguing that stocks AND bonds are overpriced.  But I have money going into my 401k and investment accounts every month - what else am I going to do with it?  100+ Million of other people gainfully employed in this rocketship of an economy have the same problem.

194 2018-01-28 21:39:47 well they are certainly more dynamic, specially Chinese stocks, they are far riskier but way more interesting

205 2018-01-28 21:33:30 1 - Small number of respondents. 2 - Still many unknowns and promises regarding the stocks of many metals (for instance, rare earth elements) on Earth crust. 3 - Anthropocene means that we reached many limits, a fact that many people seem to ignore (including environmentalists).

211 2018-01-28 21:29:21 I did get some joy at H&M - just have to make sure it’s one that stocks maternity stuff.
212 2018-01-28 21:29:17 Wishing you all the strength you need.
213 2018-01-28 21:29:14 I ask the same question. Words hurt.  Go scream at the sky.
214 2018-01-28 21:28:40 I’d say that’s a better matchup for Samus but not an easier one. Icies can still take stocks off of execution errors, while Marth has to consistently outplay you to win.
215 2018-01-28 21:27:49 Ted Williams took batting practice constantly the year he batted .400.   We do the same. #stocks #investing
216 2018-01-28 21:27:05 Damn I should’ve invited you. I didn’t think you’d do stocks.
217 2018-01-28 21:26:37 Highest in how many years ? Stock market is crazy, hope you have stocks, if not that could be a sore point for you. Democratic shenanigans #release the memo. I think the country is doing great under this President. Oh yeah he doesn’t send our money to countries that hate us.
218 2018-01-28 21:26:01 The thing is, Target told me they aren’t returns. These are being stocked already tampered with by the company that stocks cards there.
219 2018-01-28 21:23:39 And then twitter and facebook stocks fall - so yeah no they like fake accounts as it makes a larger number of users
220 2018-01-28 21:22:26 I like a lot of utilities setups. A lot of uncertainty in the sector I guess, but there was good volume in many stocks last week. I am holding XLU Jan 19 $50 calls right now for a swing, bought last week. See how it goes.
221 2018-01-28 21:22:07 at the small biotech where i work, the sam young men  with to much testosterone, who use to talk about buying stocks, now talk about BC

240 2018-01-28 21:09:12 I’d agree with that. As the wealth gap widens, so the ‘1%’ (to use your shorthand) are increasingly able to distort the free market. The best ideas and most efficient newcomers should be able to challenge the existing firms, but they are not

244 2018-01-28 21:06:23 Unlike yourself I've invested in stocks for the last 30 years. I can tell you Obama drove my stocks on a plateau forever . every month I get statements and my stocks in less than one year have skyrocketed 35% I'm a 6% average across the board.
245 2018-01-28 21:06:14 Still think any relative measure is off the mark. If someone has more or less 'wealth', that's no meaningful way of measuring your own.

The 'rich' in 'poor' countries could well have less wealth than those in 'poverty' in a 'wealthy' nation.
246 2018-01-28 21:03:05 I tend to trade the most volatile stocks in a sector, and COG is one of the most stable. Good downside protection, not sure of upside
247 2018-01-28 21:02:37 I'm not saying there's no poverty, the point is that there's seems to be a focus on relative not absolute (the 1% being an example).

The point on @bbcthisweek being capitalism fails as the wealth gap widens (relative).
248 2018-01-28 21:01:36 "The sad truth is that it is precisely those who disagree most with the hypothesis of efficient market pricing of stocks, those who pooh-pooh beta analysis and all that, who are least able to understand the analysis needed to test that hypothesis."

261 2018-01-28 20:47:59 I don't buy name brand everything. I get haircuts because there is no interest attached. I save more that way and I add that savings to the savings I get from not making car payments, I then reinvest that money currently into my stocks/index funds which earn me more money.
262 2018-01-28 20:46:30 @stockpigeon Hey buddy! I'm pretty new to the this (tsxv and cse) and I have been following you for a while. I was just wondering what scanner you use to go thru those two exchanges to find momo stocks and what is in play? Cheers
263 2018-01-28 20:46:11 My Bleach Bit stocks are looking good.
264 2018-01-28 20:45:57 Win Mch canola down A$3.80/t & EU rape down A$3.32/t. Both hit by strong A$ again. Canola acreage in Canada predicted to rise by 1 mill acres this yr. Big lift in ending stocks for this yr as well.
265 2018-01-28 20:45:46 3 main investors sold 4millions stocks at discount of 12% still they have 14% ownership. But alot of insiders selling recently. Same as in NEL
266 2018-01-28 20:44:55 dat support on 11660 levels!! $BTC $BTCUSD
267 2018-01-28 20:44:34 Newham Bookshop stocks this and I will be at Genesis selling your book. It is really good
268 2018-01-28 20:44:32 Absolutely. Relative is a nonsensical concept. Unless of course you measure poverty relative to the real poverty of 3rd world countries. That is a relationship worth measuring.
269 2018-01-28 20:42:48 So instead of let's say buying a car for $6k and saving $12k which could then be used as a down payment on a rental property that could bring you cash flow you'd rather rent a car? Or 12k that coulda gained interest in stocks over that time period and made more money?
270 2018-01-28 20:42:36 Win Mch canola down A$3.80/t & EU rape down A$3.32/t. Both hit by strong A$ again. Canola acreage in Canada predicted to rise by 1 mill acres this yr. Big lift in ending stocks for this yr as well.
271 2018-01-28 20:42:18 Awesome look forward to seeing you hun x
272 2018-01-28 20:41:48 Senate Democrats might have a rude awakening as the Trump empire gives the green light to invest in stocks and bonds... With banking taking its turn in the news, will Trump certify billions on investing in coal ash profits or will the indusry be spinning its wheels???
273 2018-01-28 20:40:30 We do apologize for that! We try to replenish our stocks on a weekly basis so hopefully, Dirty will be back online soon!
274 2018-01-28 20:40:19 1.) Enforce the +20,000 current laws with passion & vigor;
2.) Enhanced mandatory sentencing for violations;
3.) Public display in stocks for violators complete with optional tomatoe tossing;
4.) #GameOfThrones-type Walk of Shame;
5.) Pay-Per-View/televised caning like Singapore!

277 2018-01-28 20:39:11 I think it will be cool to quickly exchange crypto profits for stocks though. Much better for me to transfer money through bch or ltc to their exchange than  bank acct..
278 2018-01-28 20:36:30 Precisely which made the last Labour governments pledge to eradicate poverty in the UK a rather pointless exercise. Trying to make everyone above average.
279 2018-01-28 20:35:56 It will be interesting to see how Home Depot stocks do next week.
280 2018-01-28 20:35:27 Many people who work lower paying jobs have to chose between food on the table and insane healthcare insurance or stocks.  Reality of usa.
281 2018-01-28 20:34:59 Maybe it’s time to buy stocks in a company that makes flamethrowers 
282 2018-01-28 20:34:55 What a Birthday week. 3 finals tables. 1st, 2nd, 9th. 

11 free stocks that I should get tomorrow on Robinhood. Hit for Apple, ashame they cap referrals at $500. 

2 Binance referrals. Let’s keep this going!
283 2018-01-28 20:33:44 I hold quite a few of those name in stocks and long calls. The class built up an impressive watchlist.
284 2018-01-28 20:33:34 I dont know much a out all of this but I bet if unemployment was going up and stocks were plummeting it would definitely be Trumps fault and nothing to do with Obama
285 2018-01-28 20:33:27 Interesting, but it's only one index of large cap stocks.  What do the other indexes look like?
286 2018-01-28 20:32:29 Thanks for this wonderful piece! Transactions are already being done below 50 kobo per share Over The Counter (OTC) on these penny stocks, hence makes a lot of sense to remove the price floor and make it official. Significant bulk trades were done at deep discount to the par val
287 2018-01-28 20:30:50 No problem man. Good luck trading man! Whether you come here to PDXP or elsewhere.  Also share with me any hot stocks you find that look primed to run! I'm always on the look!
288 2018-01-28 20:30:46 stocks
289 2018-01-28 20:28:44 Think? We are in The Mother of All Bubbles (not crypto - which total of 1400 tokens is less than value of Apple)- Stocks, Bonds , Real Estate all record highs thanks to 15-20 Trillion of CB printing, Blockchain Revolution/Trust changes everything
290 2018-01-28 20:28:34 True. I think I need to shake my traditional stock market views away. Usually we buy small cap stocks and stay away from the expensive ones. However, stocks rarely reach $500, where as crypto's do. If I can buy in at $60 and it goes to $1000 in 2 years thats awesome.
291 2018-01-28 20:26:09 Booked! Can't wait x
292 2018-01-28 20:26:03 what app that for desktop weather and stocks?

298 2018-01-28 20:18:48 It's funny, I have some stocks, and they are not at an all time high. And even if they were, I would rather have them drop to an all time low than have him President. #worstpresidentever
299 2018-01-28 20:18:47 Stocks ! Of course , you know the PK " post Trump election crash".  Those of us in the real business world knew deregulation, tax cuts and pro business WH would pay off big. Anyone could see it immediately , it didn't require genius...actually and many were it baking it in early
300 2018-01-28 20:16:19 You sound gullible enough. Would you like to buy some stocks and bonds?
301 2018-01-28 20:16:16 What stocks are you people investing in this 2018?
302 2018-01-28 20:15:55 Again wrong. I'm not a Democrat & your opinion is not fact, simply an incorrect assumption. 

If not a bot, then you can provide a statement, video or article showing where a gun ban was demanded. Aussault rifles & bump stocks perhaps, but all guns? Non-NRA only please.
303 2018-01-28 20:15:47 the #GOPe's TOO BUSY LOOTING the Treasury & passing out #CorporateWelfare to the YUUGE Multi National Corps to PAY BACK their RICH DONORS to worry about RUINING the lives of Millions of common working men who can not afford the lifestyle men had in 1960 while stocks are UP 2,500%
304 2018-01-28 20:15:24 Stocks go up on expectations for profits in the next year. Investment in building factories go up when tarrifs are higher and domestic taxes are lower. Businesses do that in advance. Like the tax cut bonuses.
305 2018-01-28 20:13:41 Lots of people making lots of money because of stocks. I’m one of them. Retired is another.
306 2018-01-28 20:13:02 Your android widget only shows traditional stocks and not the crypto
307 2018-01-28 20:12:43 No fees will get some people over to Robin hood,  but there is other exchanges also coming that will be even bigger competition for @coinbase.  When you have a big name like fidelity allow customers to invest and stocks in one spot that is where we are going.
308 2018-01-28 20:12:01 Yes and the stock market is now heavily inflated due to binge buying us stocks at bottom dollar rates and every smart financial analyst knows we are heading for the biggest crash in history.
309 2018-01-28 20:11:32 Nobody is a genius, that’s the thing. One thing I do know is jobs are back and stocks are up.
310 2018-01-28 20:09:41 You're just annoyed because you listened to the experts who said the economy would crash and the stock market would plummet if Trump was elected. Those of us who were smart enough to throw every  $$ we could into stocks have made a small fortune. If you missed out, blame yourself
311 2018-01-28 20:09:26 Yes and the stock market is now heavily inflated due to binge buying us stocks at bottom dollar rates and everybsane financial analyst know we are heading for the biggest crash in history if you don't do something intelligent.

315 2018-01-28 20:02:44 CAPM works. If you had used it, you would have given lower discount rate for low volatility stocks, bought them and benefited from the low vol anomaly.
316 2018-01-28 20:01:58 That’s  because u can’t lie 2 people when they see the truth in their paychecks & in The raises their getting their 401k their stocks when they look 4 a job & can finally find 1 the American people r not stupid & we don’t believe whatever they want us 2 we do have r own minds uno
317 2018-01-28 20:01:05 My brain says: #BernieMarcus has net worth almost $6 billion. No #HomeDepot employee benefits as much from  #GOPTaxScam as he does, proportionate to each one's wages. Bernie gets tax breaks on everything: stocks, income, capital gains, estate, not one-time bonus. @TheDemocrats
318 2018-01-28 20:00:57 Invite a few to live with you! Or how about the 47,000 on skid row,,,,,,Funny your stocks should be doing better then ever! Illegal means illegal!! 
Funny concept,,,,
319 2018-01-28 20:00:06 My company just had layoffs, two close personal friends got laid off... my stocks are great, but where else is there impact???
320 2018-01-28 19:58:57 This is really good! Yes as Koi said the stocks could use a little more blending to the piece, however, it still looks f’n amazing ((:
321 2018-01-28 19:58:25 This market is economy driven. Obama economy was just the feds printing more money, over valuing stocks. 0% interest rates. 1 to 1 half gdp growth. They didn't clean up anything. He just kick the can down road.
322 2018-01-28 19:57:33 I’m thinking of investing in stocks and shit, I’m on some advanced adulting rn
323 2018-01-28 19:57:03 This feels similar to the investor’s dilemma, how people find it easier to buy stocks at the right time than to sell them.
324 2018-01-28 19:56:24 Better? Companies are laying off people and using that tax incentive money to buy back stocks! How does that help us?
325 2018-01-28 19:56:23 Come on ! The stock market hit records 99 times since trumps l election in just 1 year! Almost 3,000,000 people are getting bonuses raises stocks additional benefits as a result of president Trump’s tax reform bill.
326 2018-01-28 19:56:05 The satistical relationship between stock prices and the unemployment rate is not very predictive. However, the correlation seems to lean towards the unemployment rate affecting stocks, not the other way around.
327 2018-01-28 19:56:03 Maybe they meant the up/down 5%/10% alerts that you can receive for stocks?
328 2018-01-28 19:55:26 Thank you very much
329 2018-01-28 19:55:03 Are you really surprised at anyone at or on CNN can't saying anything positive about Pres Trump? That's how their "screening" process must be. You know they're all killing it in stocks, so shut the hell up.
330 2018-01-28 19:53:06 Addendum: The Dow Jones has been going up rapidly lately, because a lot of huge cooperations have invested in buy-back of their stocks. That's where their tax-cuts are going. Not into more jobs, not into moving plants and jobs back to the US, not going into higher saleries.
331 2018-01-28 19:52:58 Crypto markets respond to news and announcements with much larger price swings compared to stocks... good or bad! This does create opportunities though so if you love a coin and you see it drop significantly but unjustifiably, it’s probably a good time to get in! #CryptoMoodSwing
332 2018-01-28 19:52:02 VOTE LIST OF WORLD STOCKS OF BEEHIVES 2020
333 2018-01-28 19:52:01 Yeah, it's just a coincidence that unemployment is so low since Trump took office. Companies hiring & giving bonuses, due to tax cuts. When I first bought stocks, I didn't have much money. The more that people have jobs/get pay increases, the more that can invest.
334 2018-01-28 19:51:39 Investing in stocks funds companies that cure cancer and make us hamburgers. Society is powered by debt. Bitcoin world would be too bud :)

Modern markets seems to allow more conditions though:
overbought-er & oversold-er,
overbought-er-er & oversold-er-er,
etc.

337 2018-01-28 19:50:10 If you bought stocks in May 2008, just months before the financial crisis started unfolding, and you're still holding then you have made 10% per year and are up 100%. 

But if you bought in May 2008 and sold anytime between 2009-2012 then you lost money

358 2018-01-28 19:38:33 Watching @bbcthisweek  and the debate on capitalism / inequality. 

Shouldn't wealth (or otherwise) be measured absolutely not relatively? i.e. poverty shouldn't be measured against the wealth of others (otherwise there will always be poverty).

Not to mention steady nerves and ability to ignore short term noise. Much of the volatility you see is noise. Stay calm.

380 2018-01-28 19:25:39 That has been their MO. These clowns pitch stocks that are way overbought to mindless sheep. That’s when they unload the dogshit on them. Once it crashes it has already been forgotten because the majority have short attention spans. Rinse/repeat

390 2018-01-28 19:15:10 @OddStockTrader can you explain why people spend so much time bashing certain stocks from otc? Any purpose?
391 2018-01-28 19:14:23 This is because JYP and SM are Public company. While  bighit is private so they don’t sell stocks

487 2018-01-28 18:58:21 One of the greatest fallacy that one can have is to look for great stocks that have low P/E ratios, while it is true for majority to hit a home run you have to look beyond it. (1/n)
488 2018-01-28 18:58:00 If you think market is going too high too fast, you're probably right. But shorting the market too early or watching from the sidelines missing out on huge $$$, might not be your best move. Learn to hedge! #money #market #trading #stocks #options

496 2018-01-28 18:50:33 The stock market is the heart beat of the largely capitalist
U. S. economy.  If stocks are up then money flows through all hands, more job openings, increased opportunity and if it's down then money gets tight & people get laid off from work so they can't pay their bills, get it?

501 2018-01-28 18:40:00 If you’re interested in crypto gains. Many charts out there are wrong but sold to you in a way that makes their lines seem to predict. Their analysis is far too simplistic and just tries to apply rudimentary trends to crypto which acts different than stocks

522 2018-01-28 18:26:03 Hard to say with gold stocks, they don't track gold perfectly. They will likely outperform as gold gains while broader market sells off.

Remember, gold rose into 2008 handily then was slammed for 6 months. Just see what real yields did after declining. Comes atcha fast

524 2018-01-28 18:22:39 Probably right, and I’m not saying Santana is the man. I just like him more than Broxton. I like Phillips more than Keon as well but I’m not sure where he fits in either
525 2018-01-28 18:20:37 The old, old forms of public punishment should be brought back, IMO. Start with dunking, wearing a sign admitting guilt, being locked in stocks, tarred/feathered, up to execution by hanging or firing squad.  Law would require televising event.  Bring your own popcorn.

527 2018-01-28 18:19:56 Yes and that’s the improvement.  Working counts in your favor and not having a game plan is the reason why. 2-1 or 3-1 and only and not able to recognize pitch puts you at 2-2 and 3-2 which gives high K numbers

530 2018-01-28 18:17:49 I agree with that but isn’t that’s been the story sold on us about Broxton or any player in this org?
531 2018-01-28 18:16:41 Thats where I’m at with him. Having a better idea at the plate and working counts to his favor. So yes in dropping his K rate is the only way it’s going to happen.

536 2018-01-28 18:12:08 We were in a recession 9 years ago, that our last president pulled us out of.  Corporate prosperity has not  translated to middle class prosperity. Middle class wages are stagnant ... corporations are firing people and making money on stocks the middle class can't afford to buy.

545 2018-01-28 18:05:35 Disagree. Broxton is who he is and Santana is younger and still ascending.  I’m in the minority on Santana. I think the data at 24 yr old is still a work in progress.  Just my opinion. I think Santana can still improve at plate.

547 2018-01-28 18:05:17 Time to really dedicate some time to python programming, binary options, and penny stocks. Passive income is great, but don’t listen to these YouTube guru’s promising you’ll learn In a week if you buy their course.
548 2018-01-28 18:04:04 Do you mean all of the African Americans? As in non of us had good paying jobs, stocks, bonds and riches before trump? It’s almost like the poor black people of our “community” speak for all of us. How is that?? F*ck all of you touting this statistic. It means nothing.
549 2018-01-28 18:03:49 Did you mention stocks all time high? Unemployment all time low? And the lowest ever for African Americans? Not to mention tax cuts, less regulations, and our vets have better resources just to name a few. You are bias and bias news is fake! Boycott WMUR!

563 2018-01-28 17:54:10 And the question that springs to my mind is:  Did he invest in those stocks personally or through a financial consultant?  Not a big difference, but if you are going to invest your money, and want to make a profit, who do you invest with?  Where do you draw the line?

588 2018-01-28 17:40:15 Sir, I was exactly going to say the same. No idea how a fund manager thinks, many stocks still available at a bargain, and this will continue even when Nifty reaches 15k, one just needs to pick them.

608 2018-01-28 17:27:58 I knew a mother who had to pick her child up from school because he had a "weapon" it was a nail file. We can buy bump stocks, bypass regulations and buy guns easily, bring a gun to Walmart but a kid gets suspended for a manicure tool. Something is seriously wrong here.
609 2018-01-28 17:25:47 No, and since 1% of Americans own 91% of stocks, neither is it. The truth about the economy is that 85% of American households are living paycheck to paycheck, 40 million Americans live below the poverty line, and the majority are in more debt than they were in 2007.

630 2018-01-28 17:11:01 I will say that Trump mentioned (as a candidate) that the good stock market and unemployment rate numbers that Obama had weren’t important because they weren’t hitting the people that were suffering the most.  People that don’t own Stocks and “middle America”. Now it’s important

633 2018-01-28 17:08:55 TV pundits say "the economy's good" because the stock market is high. The bottom 80 percent of households owns only about 7 percent of stock. The Richest 10% of Americans Now Own 84% of All Stocks. So "good" for whom? 

They think they can sustain this because they have so far.

659 2018-01-28 16:49:51 Idiot. The stock market is only booming because of Trump. All you people with a lot of money in stocks have made a fortune thanks to Trump and yet you still suck on that suspect president. Look at what he did with the FBI, DOJ and IRS. And you still think he's a god. Laughable.
660 2018-01-28 16:49:17 Salby is a crank, he refuses to differentiate between stocks & flows. Do you understand the difference between a balance sheet & a cash flow statement? One is a snapshot in time of where all the $$ are, the other is a statement of flows & where they have gone or come from.
661 2018-01-28 16:49:17 Stocks and unemployment are just following the trend started by Obama. Trump has only managed to increase the national debt.

670 2018-01-28 16:44:27 An ex-coworker/suitemate once shared that she used to work in stocks as a desk receptionist and had a similar experience. Best she could do was quit, so she did. There really isn't a lot you can do. :/

672 2018-01-28 16:43:27 Does anybody know a Tesco that stocks Halo Top at the moment? Seems sold out everywhere. PS - you need it in your life. It is godlike.
673 2018-01-28 16:43:26 Just remember.... Everybody who voted for Trump was not unemployed........ We have not all gotten raises......And some of us don't even own any stocks or IRAs... 
THAT IS A BIG POOL OF PEOPLE STILL WAITING FOR WHAT THEY VOTED FOR......END ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
674 2018-01-28 16:42:49 Haha. What I mean by clean slate is that I am looking at the market objectively, holding no prejudices, and following my trading rules. Same ol' stocks because thats where the volume is :D Happy Sunday to you!
675 2018-01-28 16:41:25 Mine has been pretty late also. Mine averages 7-9 days and I am in Florida.
676 2018-01-28 16:41:03 Ppl investing in stocks can be considered as saving, from a macro point of view?
677 2018-01-28 16:40:47 Stocks & pillory
678 2018-01-28 16:39:39 It was a joke.  I don't believe in pure chart analysis.  And, given only 5 days, 30-mins is the largest sample period to utilize if you understand ANYTHING about statistical analysis. I have advanced engineering math degrees and have traded stocks since the 90's.
679 2018-01-28 16:38:13 If it's truly a clean slate why are you looking at the same ole stocks? :) Jk jk, rest easy!
680 2018-01-28 16:37:52 The market is finally moving because of corporate confidence and now tax break it is not based on phony dot com stocks like the 90s
681 2018-01-28 16:37:14 @RealJamesWoods   Demos vote against EVERYTHING yet BENEFIT from all POTUS does to make America Great.  Stocks up, 26,000 and they get richer!  What hypocrites!
682 2018-01-28 16:34:24 It might but with the USD $UUP set to reverse course, I wouldn’t bet on a sustainable rally in oil and energy stocks $USO $XLE
683 2018-01-28 16:31:27 Accept for gun control. Even after one of there own representatives was shot in a random act of gun violence, snd after all the school and mass shootings, they still refuse to pass any gun control legislation whatsoever, not even on bump stocks.

I’m buying Tesla Stocks...! 

(I don’t believe in stocks...but I’ll buy Tesla for sure)
688 2018-01-28 16:28:44 Puh lease. You found one article. Only those against trump can argue the economy isn’t better now.  But keep trying. Did you sell your stocks when he got elected?
689 2018-01-28 16:27:14 To accumulate money then see how they can duplicate their money by investing into stocks, bonds, currency market such as cryptocurrency and forex also to tap into the ICO risk market to get 20X 
690 2018-01-28 16:25:41 Hold up I legit stopped watching figuring he'd lost this. I guess they were all playing Fox instead of their mains but he had like 13 stocks of players on the AZ PR to take, several of whom helped beat his team last Cliquefeast, and then he had Medz. This is nutty

692 2018-01-28 16:24:10 im no designer but id focus on trying to blend to stocks into the scene better with lighting, colors etc., looks too out of place/fake

694 2018-01-28 16:21:32 2000 lies. ISIS defeated in 30 days? Mexico paying for the wall? Making fun of the disabled. Pussy grabbing. Inciting people at rallies to fight & offering to pay legal fees. Calling nazis very fine people. Encouraging police to rough people up. Stocks are volatile.
695 2018-01-28 16:20:35 @JimCramer I’m want to start investing. What company should I work with? Also, is it best to buy stocks or bond, or diversify? Thanks

698 2018-01-28 16:17:22 "crypto's a speculative bubble. They just make money out of thin air"

Stocks: Company X produces a product or provides a service and as long as sales are justified the stock price can double and split endlessly. So twice the value after a short span

700 2018-01-28 16:15:27 Imbyerna parin ako sa RL cause been waiting for the stocks na dumating then pagdating yung orders ko wala?  Dinamihan ko yung choices para kahit isa may dumating pero wala talaga  Pabibo kayo staff 
701 2018-01-28 16:15:14 As long as the decline of the dollar continues... The stock market will keep rising... A declining dollar is great for stocks because it artificially increases a companies assets which increases the value of a company
702 2018-01-28 16:15:02 Low performers get booted so that theY don’t take the market. There is also the fact that >90% of all stocks are owned by the top 20% richest people in the country...
703 2018-01-28 16:13:30 Additionally, Visa and MasterCard have never been value stocks. You are paying for the growth. Is 30x too much to pay? Depends on if those earnings keep rising at a steady clip. Crypto, PayPal and others are threats.
704 2018-01-28 16:13:16 Understood, but don't use that to make trump look better... and most Americans don't own stocks, so that's largely untrue.
705 2018-01-28 16:13:11 And your name should be LAY-Z. Pres Trump is MAGA. You’re a businessman & you know now that Trump’s economic policies are good for business. And if you are an investor & own stocks, admit that the value of your investments are much higher. So, who is the super bug?
706 2018-01-28 16:13:11 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains

708 2018-01-28 16:08:58 Hio stori ya trap ni true! You've not met a lady in her early 30's baying for a child! FYI menopause has gone to 35! It's like hurry while stocks last.
709 2018-01-28 16:08:58 Ah, another person that doesn't own stocks.
710 2018-01-28 16:08:22 Gets at your premise earlier, are they to the point where they want to shock the market? Are stocks making them nervous enough yet?
711 2018-01-28 16:07:55 Buy insulation co. stocks.
712 2018-01-28 16:07:52 It is so obvious, It is something like an account identity, same as 1-1=0. But people always confuse stocks and flows. Apart from 'special' cases such as IPOs and stock repurchase, no matter how high the value of the market is going, the net flow of money is just... null !!!
713 2018-01-28 16:07:35 Good companies and good stocks are not the same thing. The world needs good companies, but traders only need good stocks. How do you find good stocks? Charts!
714 2018-01-28 16:05:45 Investments made  with emotional attachment and lack of knowledge are a good recipe for disaster. #knowledge #investing #quote #stocks #business #study

716 2018-01-28 16:03:36 My mother has owned various dividend stocks since the 1970s and a couple of them have done spinoffs. I tried to convince her to sell GE in the $50s back in 2000 but she has held through them.
717 2018-01-28 16:02:04 @kurteichenwald  Your tweet about dumping all your stocks upon Mr. Trump being elected.   You were a complete dunce to do that.  I hope your children are now satisfied that they won't be able to go to college now.  Don't know what you do but that was a stupid thing to do.
718 2018-01-28 15:59:42 In my own personal portfolio, I own stocks for long periods. I have owned one position for 18 years. I'm  an investor, not a trader.
719 2018-01-28 15:58:57 Hi! I just ordered SHINee SG from Kpopyah Shopie on Facebook. Try asking if they have more stocks ;)
720 2018-01-28 15:58:14 This is your proof. A chart U made at home. NO PROOF OF WHERE IT CAME FROM. U MUST NOT HAVE A 401K OR ANY STOCKS THAT U HAVE WATCHED OVER
721 2018-01-28 15:56:46 All #Investment is like that. Whether I buy gold, stocks, real estate, collectibles, art as an investment avenue, it is with the idea that someone will buy it from me at a higher price. You might say there's no real value in #cryptocurrency, but so is the case with #fiatcurrency
722 2018-01-28 15:55:47 Remember when 45 sent Boeing stocks plummeting when in Dec. 2016 he said that cost of new planes was way too high? Now we know he was thinking strategically, putting money aside knowing he had 2 fridges to replace pretty soon. Best thinking of the presidency so far!
723 2018-01-28 15:55:31 Bonds crashing is the reasin stocks are rising. That money has to go somewhere
724 2018-01-28 15:54:52 $HMNY unfortunately all the pumpers are bag holders. They are not going to buy or add more stocks.
725 2018-01-28 15:54:46 Theoretically, pensions will need to sell stocks to buy bonds to keep their asset allocations in check. Major brokerages are throwing around huge numbers for the current monthly rebalancing. I have seen these numbers thrown around before to little effect so I did some digging 1/n

727 2018-01-28 15:50:28 401k and investing in stocks are my shit for when it’s pouring outside. When I was @ the Home Depot In 4 years since the beginning I started my 401k and when I got fired I didn’t have shit saved. So in those four years I accumulated $7,000 almost 8K. That’s 400 20’s
728 2018-01-28 15:50:20 sexism is dividing the class into girl/boy and teaching the boys how to do taxes and stocks while the girls learn how to sew a button on cloth and make pancakes (as if they can’t read the box)
729 2018-01-28 15:50:10 I had a quesiton: do people work for ZH have a 401k ? do they have it in equity etf like SPY EEM etc? they dont believe in bonds, dont like cash, no stocks, so what do they do?
730 2018-01-28 15:50:03 People should be looking at what they are doing. Repatriation of money, buying back of stocks and laying off and reorganizing. That looks like to me they are shoring up for something.  is coming
731 2018-01-28 15:49:13 I hope you are willing to give President Obama the same credit and props he deserves since that decline began under HIS watch...same with stocks, economy etc.

734 2018-01-28 15:46:21 When looking at stocks like $FDX $BA and $DE, I wonder if $WMT is just beginning a meaty move to $130.
735 2018-01-28 15:44:26 These ain't stocks.  These are the currencies of the new world.  Seller beware.
736 2018-01-28 15:43:18 Yup! All in agreement. I’m excited to see what Robinhood does around security though as if they do offer a stocks/shares/crypto platform together that works and is secure, that really is a very big deal.
737 2018-01-28 15:42:06 And Carrier, as an example, after you praised them, is leaving the U.S. Don't break your arm trying to pat yourself on the back, will you take the credit if things go back down? (Stocks always go down again) Or blame it and name call some Dems? #AlternativeFacts
738 2018-01-28 15:41:44 I tried to make point more saliently when @bradloncar posted the flows but no one noticed lol.  Two big deals will take $20B out of circulation. I iagine $3-4 billion flowed into those stocks by merger and arb guys. Add $ABLX where deal was in flux. Lotsa $$$
739 2018-01-28 15:41:05 Fired up to see he and Tim Settle show off and keep raising their stocks
740 2018-01-28 15:40:57 Buying quality stocks is not enough, at what price it  matters.
741 2018-01-28 15:40:57 Yea, about that memo,  so you know secret things, have inside  knowledge?  Then i have some stocks i can sell you lol.
742 2018-01-28 15:40:22 He has stocks in big pharma so of course he is not for Medicare for all, he is against marijuana legalization because big pharma is against it. He is down with unconstitutional mass surveillance. No thanks on Republican lite joe
743 2018-01-28 15:38:49 my three passions, stocks, sex, and sports (Ok really baseball) two sex and stocks play well on twitter. baseball not so much. But now that AVN and expo are over, time to turn to baseball. pitcher and catchers report in 20 days...:)

746 2018-01-28 15:35:31 Good luck Lynsay hope all goes well
747 2018-01-28 15:35:22 I think if you had one, you'd know what it's called.  My 401K didn't change at all.  What stocks are you invested in?  (By the way, that wasn't a lie.  He thought that was going to be true at the time.  Republicans got in the way of that.)
748 2018-01-28 15:34:21 Our local newspaper's stocks columnist released his 2018 pick stocks this morning. He must have written the column before last week. One of his stocks was WYNN.
749 2018-01-28 15:34:00 Crytocurrency going back up. First time all my stocks been up.!
750 2018-01-28 15:33:38 No. It never has. When the wealthy get those tax breaks they buy stocks and pay dividends. They do not invest in jobs in America. Expand overseas sweatshops definitely, but very little, if anything, for American workers.

755 2018-01-28 15:31:51 Congratulations to those who can afford to buy stocks.  Too bad the rest of us have just enough money to cover the rent/mortgage, food, gas, clothes, heating fuel, phone, and maybe a movie a couple of times a year.
756 2018-01-28 15:31:44 We will notify you of the stocks you should BUY and those you should SELL!
757 2018-01-28 15:31:12 Markets are up globally. trump is not responsible for that. Most Americans don't own stocks. Walmart only gave bonuses to 20 yr employees - then closed stores. Nothing but a stunt to take cover for their undeserved windfall. They could've given bonuses to those folks before now.

767 2018-01-28 15:22:16 Who cares.
1. My stocks are doing well.  This includes teacher pensions.

775 2018-01-28 15:17:22 Some stocks yes. I would argue that’s unlikely for most large cap companies. It’s all about what you buy.
776 2018-01-28 15:16:44 + remettez dès stocks bdp. Non seulement c'est cher Mais y a pas ce qu'on veut.
777 2018-01-28 15:16:37 The problem with stocks is that if it's ever goes very low , it's worthless. Magic cards you can still use them to play and collect !
778 2018-01-28 15:16:33 What will be tgt for all the above stocks and timeframe?
779 2018-01-28 15:13:57 Bighit stock can't rise because they aren't a openly traded company where anyone can buy stocks, they are a private corporation
780 2018-01-28 15:13:33 For the 2018 version of the #BradRedmanMemorial the GLASS field has been split up into 3 different divisions, the 440s, the 330s and Stocks. So there will be 3 winners of the race, which is Wed-1/31.
781 2018-01-28 15:12:46 The DEMS need to get over their hate of President Trump and send him THANK YOU NOTES for their increase in Stocks and making them richer, legally!!
782 2018-01-28 15:12:30 I catch myself being emotional about stocks at times but have succeeded in taking small losses when I believe a trend is broken. Also I have been able to let my winner run. This has helped me greatly. Still difficult not to get emotional on stock you believe in.
783 2018-01-28 15:11:36 The stocks and shares are not IOUs. They’re contracts. But I get what you’re saying re the cash. The banks do lose out in my example though - I think you missed the point in ref to security.
784 2018-01-28 15:11:20 Its amazing a yr into this president & these idiots thank Obama for all ur good. Yes O did some but our stocks were stagnant unemployment & welfare were getting worst. All this has changed & its not O its Trump. I will never get tired of #Winning 

Thank you To the best President

789 2018-01-28 15:06:40 Trump gave OUR money to corporations so they could buy out their stocks & a FEW gave 1K one time bonuses to help sell the tax cuts. 1K is a LOT for workers because shithole employers like Home Depot pay minimum wages.

794 2018-01-28 15:00:15 People who follow the market know markets have two directions: up and down. We all like up when we are already invested. We like down when we want to buy in. Keep in mind that if the market is rising too high too fast, stocks may be over-valued. That means they're going to adjust
795 2018-01-28 14:59:41 Boom? Really,  cause the DOW continues to rise? Its an Index of only 30 largecap multinational nyse stocks. It doesnt even represent the health of stocks in general, let alone the economy or even the American economy.  It reflects sentiment of 10% of tge people and investment cos
796 2018-01-28 14:59:34 Why do you keep lying? Billionaires are buying up their own stocks to inflate it and draw suckers to buy. 400,000 jobs were lost in 2017; 372 malls closed; 6,300 stores closed, and the carnage continues into 2018 unchecked. Fire Stephen Miller, his advice is dangerous & stupid.
797 2018-01-28 14:59:24 Actually, I disagree. Treating crypto as a unique asset type holds it back from being mass market. Robinhood merges it with commodities, stocks and shares. 

Tiffany, you and I understand cryptocurrency but the average investor shouldn’t need to - otherwise it will never sustain.
798 2018-01-28 14:58:53 I owned Corus a few years ago, was one of my first dividend stocks. Ended up selling it and buying weedstocks.  Sold pretty much even. Looks like you are buying the dip, good play.
799 2018-01-28 14:57:15 They should care enough to verify that the platform offers the same level of security as it does with stocks instead of blindly assuming.
Crypto is unique in that it can be spent by anybody who gets their hands on the keys and that transactions are instant & irreversible.
800 2018-01-28 14:55:20 Do you have stocks or shares? Do you know the real technical details of how the platform you use to buy, stores them? And by the real technical details I mean the physical contracts and assets? I would guess no...
801 2018-01-28 14:53:00 This is just flat out stupid statement. Sorry. Stocks have had huge gains due to 45s cutting stufling regulations and lowering taxes across the board. NObmana sucked and was a fraud and corrupt. He will get his.. it’s just beginning.
802 2018-01-28 14:52:44 my mom asked me whats on the news... so i did... and she was like 'may balita ba about sa stocks?' and ngayon ko lang naalala... 

anong paki ng masa sa stock exchange? di naman sila target audience nun. 


803 2018-01-28 14:52:32 The question is how many blacks,  latinos and low income families have STOCKS? Trump always taking abt high number but where he gets that info?
804 2018-01-28 14:52:22 What stealing? The SNB saved us from a deflationary spiral, we essentially have no inflation. Economy is running well and stocks, bonds and real estate had good performance.
All is well and SNB making good gains and can distribute to state where we are also well financed.
805 2018-01-28 14:51:58 Stan Wanner and Korey Sites should be considered in the street stocks as well.
806 2018-01-28 14:51:35 @MariaBartiromo I don't own stocks but wonder, because the market is rising so quickly, is there something supporting it. Can it crash as fast as it rose? Some times I worry that the better we do, the harder the fall if it comes like in 2008.
807 2018-01-28 14:50:54 People have been using digital trading platforms long before crypto. You and I know the difference in storing crypto v stocks. But the users of trading platforms don’t care - nor should they. Mass market isn’t about being experts in each investment type...
808 2018-01-28 14:47:50 The numbers are truth- w trajectories relative to all factors, including Trump's destructive policies already causing lowered GDP growth. Stocks will catch up to what the bond mkt, a near-inverted yield curve & tanking USD already know

Now run along, my ignorant deluded friend

816 2018-01-28 14:38:58 What’s really amazing is because the stock market is so high people say look it’s a better economy BUT the people he claimed to want to help DO NOT HAVE MONEY TO INVEST IN STOCKS!!

833 2018-01-28 14:24:35 No - but I think you’re wrong. While you and I want to move coins to a private wallet, the average investor absolutely does not. They want security and a platform which can hold their investment like with stocks and shares...!
834 2018-01-28 14:24:17 1) who says MM incentives have any conflicts?   Rebates only on the stocks they make markets in is both simpler and less extreme than giving discounts across all stocks traded.   2) They could also have given them queue priority like NYSE.  That said, their plan is smart.
835 2018-01-28 14:23:55 (Hums) especially with the new marked mate and if you also turned, horny will be not enough to describe the feeling. I already have the new batch of stocks, why?
836 2018-01-28 14:20:11 What? Only 50%? Not on top of my leaderboard as other stocks you recommended in 2017 are double and triple baggers, compared to them, this is zilch.
837 2018-01-28 14:19:35 I’m far from rich. In fact, I’m on the lower end salary wise but I own stocks because I had the discipline, yes that horrendous word, to do without whatever was trendy at the time to put some back for the future. Everyone is victim of their decisions, quit labeling people!
838 2018-01-28 14:19:19 Obama brought you out of a recession,  unemployment went down,  stocks were up,  Trump stepped into a good thing,  the bottom will fall out!

Thank you for your feedback.
We would highly prefer to have enough stocks for everyone to order/start their instance whenever they want/need to. :)
We are doing our best to provide more stocks asap !
842 2018-01-28 14:17:49 Trump Fake News. Twisting actual facts into outright LIES. Like never before? Receipts man. Last year's job creation was lower than almost EVERY year under Obama. Companies are using the #GOPTaxScam to buyback stocks & layoff workers. This tweet is pure bullshit propaganda.

Pam: jim....*smiles* i'm rich too now. my stocks are doing so well *kisses jim*

Jim: we'll buy a mansion

Dwight: i've become rich also, from bitcoin and crypto currency

Jim: *looks at camera*
882 2018-01-28 13:40:05 That's wrong lol. About 90% of all stocks on the stock exchange are owned by the richest 10% of Americans. The stock market is a great indication for how well people like Trump, Linda McMahon, Betsy Devos,Steve mnuchin, Wilbur Ross and Gary Cohn are doing. Trump's oligarchs
883 2018-01-28 13:38:40 I have some stocks and the bank automatically take my taxes from the profits I make on dividends etc
884 2018-01-28 13:36:50 I’m trying to find some new stocks to invest in and it’s stressing me out
885 2018-01-28 13:36:43 Also I have a tracking list of about 100 stocks. After sometime you know what your levels are where it’s a safe entry. Recent one for me being Radico at 265. Something I told @Rachitpandey299 about. 

Also don’t sell at exactly 10%,ride them with a rising SL.Covers the bad trades
886 2018-01-28 13:36:40 I know Jamie Oliver means well with his 5 ingredient meals, but my Co-op only stocks maybe 2 or 3 of the ingredients for all of his recipe's. 

To be fair, it now stocks red cabbage after the red cabbage incident of 2016
887 2018-01-28 13:35:55 Thanks Dirty Donald for staying on Twitter and out of the way of governing. Youve made the office a joke but as long as my stocks go up I dont care anymore.
888 2018-01-28 13:34:49 A record number of business are laying off hundreds of employees, closing stores and factories and buying back their stocks with that fabulous wind fall of a tax break.  I can’t wait to see the employee ent numbers next month and how you’ll spin that one.  Can’t blame Obama
889 2018-01-28 13:34:18 And my mantra is I track trends. Then find a couple stocks from that trend. Sometimes I am ahead of the trend. Then I try entering them when I see a breakout. Last one was crude (still has a long way to go Coz results will start from q4) and next could be Infra/Power.
890 2018-01-28 13:34:08 It's a global rise in stocks fuelling employment. Not due to your policies at all.

904 2018-01-28 13:23:17 If they are disseminating good relevant information about the company or product i think its fine, if they are repeatedly talking about potential short squeezes in their stocks No!

910 2018-01-28 13:22:34 You can't take credit. Your mess is about to begin. President Obama gets all the credit. Sure stocks are up etc but you forgot a huge chunk of America. The poor and the middle class.
911 2018-01-28 13:20:20 They floated on the stocks so they could make more money for themselves that's a fact nothing went to utd coffers only glazers pockets and utd didn't borrow anything the glazers did to buy the club and then put the debt on the club and we can still do what we do, imagine no debt?
912 2018-01-28 13:20:15 I love stocks because although I know I could lose I put it all on the line I want it all or nothing 
913 2018-01-28 13:19:57 Imo ward should be given gametime, no matter how bad he plays hell still be better than blth the laughing stocks weve veen playing recently
914 2018-01-28 13:17:53 VXX & UVXY look interesting on a 2 yr monthly chart showing large back-to-back green volume bars that are at highest levels of the period. Someone is paying attention and gold is sneaking w/ rising rates, higher stocks and a VX most people are dissing. Cracks are appearing.

916 2018-01-28 13:16:42 Could be multiple reasons. Since he's such a big player the club wanted him to play his last game to prove lack of commitment to the fans. Dortmund losing out on stocks if info is leaked. Dortmund wanting him to attend court as a Dortmund player in respect.

921 2018-01-28 13:11:51 Ja, exakt. De håller jag med om och skriver i inlägget. Men i med att lagstiftningen är som den är så är det ändå en förlust för aktieägare. Om bolaget inte kan dela ut hela när de har tänkt kan de lika gärna hålla inne den senare.
922 2018-01-28 13:11:40 You into stocks now?

935 2018-01-28 12:59:45 Don't forget gold. Only time gold was higher since 2007 was from 2011-13. Gold is rising when the VIX is dead, stocks are soaring, rates are rising. This is a story here that many are overlooking. Is gold smarter than the stock or bond market at sniffing out the future?

944 2018-01-28 12:47:14 This implies a lack of broad based large sample size components that make a market not in complete sync & supportive of ATH status-a red flag of caution if you will. Why werent more & more stocks turning green from prior close?

987 2018-01-28 12:03:34 of course its a gamble. The mistake they made was not adding " like stocks, real estate and bonds, all investments that provide a potential profit also contain a risk element.

1010 2018-01-28 11:31:49 This blew up in 2008. In my backtesting, I found that highly leveraged value stocks suffered declines around 80% during the crash. If you stuck to low debt/equity, those losses were contained to the market decline of 40% or so.

Last season -

Outcome = Dead stocks cleared

This season -
50℅ production due to #GST
Expected sales 100%
Outcome = Sales will perish

1027 2018-01-28 11:09:07 To buy stocks in companies that people really need is an old stock investment strategy that proved to work well (e.g. Warren Buffet). Could faircoins be the stable "people-really-need-coins" within blockchain? #FairCoin #blockchain

3- stocks like manappuram  ...muthoot finance
Or any other stock like pcj ...vaibhava global?
1030 2018-01-28 11:01:55 Even Warren Buffet endorsement is not working for Airline stocks in US. Major major fall this week in all names. Warren Buffet would have lost 1 billion dollar in this investment this week alone
1031 2018-01-28 11:00:27 Hmm. Well, FTSE 100 and 250 are not good indicators of economic performance because the companies listed predominantly derive income and profits from global trading/investment holdings, not domestic economy. UK-focused stocks have underperformed massively since the EU ref.
1032 2018-01-28 10:56:20 The only time gold was higher was from 2011-13. Gold is rising here where the VIX is dead, stocks are soaring and rates are rising. Is gold a story that many are overlooking or not considering? Is gold smarter than the stock or the bond market at sniffing out a different future?

1149 2018-01-28 08:26:21 I think quality stocks are going much higher, and will benefit from the bond bubble popping. Huge amounts of $$$ will want to find a home in tangible assets. The DOW has been getting some of this as we speak... EU -> US capital flow. DOW 30,000+
1150 2018-01-28 08:25:04 As for your objection, prof: you don't make an investment in a stock based solely on what happened over the past decade (as does CAPE), so some degree of forward looking IS required. 
PS I am NOT arguing 'stocks are cheap', just dissing CAPE bellwether fetish.

1179 2018-01-28 07:48:07 If you are investing directly in stocks, don't take index returns as a proxy for long term buy and hold returns. An index, by its very nature, benefits from survivorship bias.

1192 2018-01-28 07:19:16 People are buying the economist because they expect to get valuable information.  This is foolish.

People buy shares, stocks, gold, collectables, art, real estate because they expect other people to buy it higher than them.

1199 2018-01-28 07:02:02 All that strong stock market has done is create more layoffs and closing stores than ever before, now that they got tax breaks they don't have to sell as much product to make as much money so mass closings and layoffs have begun but hey who gives a shit with high stocks right?
1200 2018-01-28 07:01:00 Oh, you're a vampire as well? I think I kinda need some for today... But I'll be filling my stocks tomorrow, so maybe if you wanted some I can get them for you too.

1205 2018-01-28 06:53:52 Yeah even though stocks are rising economy rising lower unemployment and not part time jobs. Wanting to fund current and ex military more than paying taxes on illegals. Yeah you’re part of the problem. @realDonaldTrump best president in decades. Obama crippled business

1217 2018-01-28 06:38:01 Stocks are up because these big corps receiving tax cuts are increasing dividends. It's not trickling down. Huge layoffs and closeouts, like Walmart's Sam stores.
1218 2018-01-28 06:36:56 They let the fox in the hen house and they’re all excited because stocks went up a little but guess what eventually someone is coming for the fox. And the FBI and Mueller are gonna let that fox get away
1219 2018-01-28 06:35:32 You're welcome.
I'd say investors were patient and truly believed in LT value investing in stocks, from 1929 till the 1950s (avg holding period of 8 yrs). 
Later, everyone seems to have become a short-termist, an opportunist who just wants to have a one-night stand with stocks!
1220 2018-01-28 06:31:15 The top 10% own > 80% of stocks. The bottom 50% have no money in the market. 2017 GDP growth similar to Obama’s last term. How is increasing wealth inequality good for anyone besides the wealthy? Tourism money actually goes to poor/middle class in the service industry.

Its 1 mil on potentially millions of shares traded, but could be EARNED on thousands of shares posted that trade

1256 2018-01-28 05:38:44 It's not impossible, in fact, traditional stocks have broken parabolic advances and then continued to go up. 

It just seems unlikely.
1257 2018-01-28 05:38:33 When something is too good to be true, it generally is. This is what @udaykotak also said during the 1997 Asian crisis. This applies to individual stocks as well

1287 2018-01-28 05:00:38 I’m not sure what you meant. The dotcom era was a frenzy and a speculative bubble. People looked at the internet, they realised it was the future and people went nuts for stocks. Then it crashed. Now look where we are now
1288 2018-01-28 05:00:15 You've got to carry out a long-term investment plan, if you don't have time to manage a day trading account.

1298 2018-01-28 04:52:31 3. Sadly, leftists don’t understand that when businesses do well, Americans do well. When businesses make more money, their stockholders make money. (Think retirement accts, 401K) Stocks go up, & business have CAPITAL $$. They use that money to expand their businesses.

1305 2018-01-28 04:44:17 I hope that any Democrat will "use their stupid  brains" and dump their home depot stocks. I know now, I will never give them a penny!!!!!!
1306 2018-01-28 04:40:26 What gets lost in the reporting is the fact that European and Asian country stocks are doing great also. It's the global economy that's fueling the surge. Not Trump all by himself. If Germany or Japan falter, it will affect us also.

1308 2018-01-28 04:39:39 Hey congrads on the FB stock.
I have only recieved 4 free stocks valued at 5$
Still great tho. I have a serious question for you.
Did you choose Left Middle or Right for that FB stock?
1309 2018-01-28 04:38:37 I thought HOME DEPOT removed him from the board because every time he opens his mouth the stocks drop. I gave them up months ago. Ace and Lowe’s for me
1310 2018-01-28 04:37:30 these shoes are literally you “DC” “darth cure” and they’re made from your flower stocks!?
1311 2018-01-28 04:37:21 I follow him closely and I feel he is promoting more than normal stocks which is not required
1312 2018-01-28 04:36:24 Not only did ty Cobb invest in Coca Cola he put heavy action on cup stocks that year. If spiking a guy in the balls moved his stock up it was a win win for him.
1313 2018-01-28 04:35:38 Growing debt servicing is a sign of increasing debt stocks as the government relies heavily on borrowing for budgetary support and development expenditure.
1314 2018-01-28 04:35:29 OK, campaign finance reform. I’m in, as I believe mostest people would... let’s say us with little to no stocks. You know, the people who labor everyday.
1315 2018-01-28 04:35:13 #SNL so true Bush created the 2 wars Prez Obama is the reason 4 stocks going up the job market etc no one wants to give him credit 4 anything
1316 2018-01-28 04:33:20 Stock market is independent of the president. They're up globally. The average American doesn't own stocks. Job creation has decreased in the last year.

1320 2018-01-28 04:32:08 Stocks completed five-week winning streak on Friday with the KSE-100 index notching gains of 372 points (0.84 per cent) to close at 44,551.
1321 2018-01-28 04:31:41 Ako din nahirapan hahaha, nagkataon lang talaga. Mga last stocks na yan eh, wala nga ko nung malaki
1322 2018-01-28 04:30:57 If you have just one card then just sell it at MSRP and wait for stocks to arrive. I hope they arrive atleast i a year time.
1323 2018-01-28 04:30:51 Saudi's start to play with Iran financial war's game stocks ,Bond's etc.
1324 2018-01-28 04:29:55 I am buying only those stocks, where I have atleast a 3 yr view, and prepared to take a 30% drawdown and ready to average lower.

As said earlier, good distribution happening in small and mid caps.

All can keep some cash in pf.
1325 2018-01-28 04:25:26 Robinhood is fine for stocks. You just have to know what it is and use it appropriately. Not sure what people expect from an app with no commission trades.
1326 2018-01-28 04:21:52 I said split, not reverse-split. Why do you think so many retail investors get burned by penny stocks? To them, penny stocks seem cheap and Berkshire Hathaway seems expensive. #sadbuttrue
1327 2018-01-28 04:21:40 Obama took office at a bottom,w/nowhere to go but up.  Despite being outgained by BHO in his 1st year,the strong stock market performance since DJT’s election proves that the daily noise projecting DJT’s poisonous effect on stocks was not only overstated; it was  simply incorrect

1337 2018-01-28 04:06:00 There are Class A and Class B Stocks. Class A are publicly held but Class B is private. Class B is where the control is and that is majority owned by the Ochs/Sulzberger families.

1339 2018-01-28 04:02:44 My parents invested in stocks under my name when I was born and you won’t believe how much money they have earned.. you better believe I am going to do this for my kids
1340 2018-01-28 03:59:05 Why not just trade forex or stocks & bonds?  If you can't make $ in those markets, what makes you think you can profitably trade crypto, and then actually cash out without any hiccups?
1341 2018-01-28 03:56:13 I do use a lot of leverage; 90% of trades are options 
Longer term plays I either use LEAPs or some combination of stocks + options
1342 2018-01-28 03:53:51 I got in same day to buy stocks and the crypto isn’t available yet. Coinbase better up their game or they are in trouble.

1344 2018-01-28 03:47:15 yep, and I have stocks which have almost doubled. And most people i talk to here in NY have had less taxes taken out of their checks. And we're in NY, which is supposed to be where the tax bill didn't help as much. i can only imagine how good it is for people in low taxed states

1346 2018-01-28 03:45:40 @Bloodbath_TV So, I was checking out January’s Horror Pack and was really interested in knowing when your unboxing video for it will be up. :-)
1347 2018-01-28 03:44:52 Yeah Johnny b's, only 2 games were last stocks
1348 2018-01-28 03:44:50 How do you find stocks that are showing this pattern? you have a scanner?
1349 2018-01-28 03:43:46 The top 10% financially savvy population which invests in stocks gets tax favourable policy. The bottom half, which knows only banks and post office deposits, has to pay tax on interest. Different brand of socialism.
1350 2018-01-28 03:42:59 Investing in stocks these last couple months have taught me a lot also.
1351 2018-01-28 03:42:26 So, is it good time to buy the stocks?
1352 2018-01-28 03:40:50 Neoh vs Pgh crew battle was hype af, @cilvanis took 7 stocks im pretty sure? And @colinies clutched it out last hit. Lots of cheering from Neoh which was hype to hear lol.

1356 2018-01-28 03:30:45 The best investment you can make is not in stocks or property, but in the hearts of the people.
1357 2018-01-28 03:30:06 I WATCH YOUR SHOW EVERYDAY - I DONT EVEN HAVE STOCKS BUT WHEN @realDonaldTrump TAX CUTS KICK IN - I WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THE MONEY- JUST HOPING @NBC TANKS THE MARKET WITH FAKE NEWS BEFORE I BUY [JUST A DAY]
1358 2018-01-28 03:28:02 Bauer said they “only made a few” of the #VAPORADV sticks. But let’s be real, the NHLers who have them, are using their normal pro stocks with the ADV graphics. So it doesn’t apply to them.

1359 2018-01-28 03:23:29 Sorry for the boring response but I would buy some solid stocks.

1367 2018-01-28 03:12:53 A high surprise GDP report might have shaken stocks as it means Fed will boost rates. If revised upward later it won't be a headline.
1368 2018-01-28 03:09:25 It's what Twitter told the Senate Intel committee. That high of a number of fake accounts will have a negative impact on their stocks. That's why they initially said they didn't think the number was that high. Their wallets will suffer, so they have no motivation to lie about it.
1369 2018-01-28 03:07:47 Hi Ashwini gujaral sir, I watch your views on cnbc tv 18 at 8.30 pm around..my dad invests in Penny stocks a lot. Do you have any paid workshop that can equip me with the skills to identify multibagger penny stocks that can make us rich by making a rigorously studied investment??

1407 2018-01-28 02:29:06 /2 positively and remove those that are not. And, let’s say this for the millionth time, A GOOD STOCK MARKET IS NOT INDICATIVE OF A GOOD ECONOMY. The more businesses pocket and give back to shareholders, the more stocks rise. That has NOTHING to do with how the actual people

1415 2018-01-28 02:17:21 The big winners come from the so called high risk categories,but the risk have more to do with the investors than with the categories. The greater advantage to investing in a stocks, to one who accept uncertainties, is the extraordinary reward for being right.
1416 2018-01-28 02:15:26 It is also disappointing that in US high schools or colleges we do not have a mandatory finance class that teaches you about checking/savings accounts, stocks, bonds, stop limit losses, hedge funds, 401ks, etc etc. Imagine how much better our society could be if we taught this.

1425 2018-01-28 01:58:58 Agreed, but use in the context of mean reversion (technically anti-persistence). Current "average" yields fairly uninspiring. So I expect reversion. But that doesn't mean same impacts (good or bad) for everyone. Hence why I favour "mixed bag". Like stocks -some rise, some fall.
1426 2018-01-28 01:54:45 The stock market doesn't represent the economy. The rich are pumping money into it now, so that when the companies buy back stocks with their tax cuts, they can get a bigger return.
1427 2018-01-28 01:51:22 Is it not how futures function? Lol just because $btc appreciated a lot in a short period of time why should expectations differ if people have bullish expectations. It’s all speculation after all  be it stocks or commodities

1433 2018-01-28 01:44:08 But the lost of $$$$$$ for Boeing could end up much bigger with fighter jets, the complete order could be to get 88 jets the complete jet stocks. That is xxxxx Billions $ !

1442 2018-01-28 01:32:37 There's actually been a lot of change in design even since I joined in 2015 - 2015 GE stuff looks very dated to me.

But there's colour and design - changing colour would be huge, think of stocks of merchandise - many small local parties wd struggle to find £ for dramatic chg.

1444 2018-01-28 01:30:24 This couple at the bar, the guy is like “I’ve been having fun with crypto coins” and the girl immediately launches into a long rant about how stocks are fake money
1445 2018-01-28 01:28:45 Watch the market leaders, the stocks that have led the charge upward in a bull market. That is where the action is and where the money is to be made. As the leaders go, so goes the entire market.
1446 2018-01-28 01:26:58 Not good stocks
1447 2018-01-28 01:26:06 But thanks to him, I invest in stocks for longer term and feel completely safe having all of my networth in it

1458 2018-01-28 01:13:38 #TamponGary has picked a really, really ridiculous issue to rant about. He doesn’t appear to have any self-awareness whatsoever, or any grasp that he’s made himself and his party twin laughing stocks. I can only assume it’s that time of the month. #TamponParty #SoundsKinky
1459 2018-01-28 01:13:22 There are many other markets that are not subject to Fed interventions. I am beginning to learn these markets and am not going to trade stocks and indices as there is way too much emotion and artificial stimulations in them. There's always a choice.

1471 2018-01-28 01:01:27 Darnit, im gonna miss all the tweets about how your stocks are doing and what executive decisions are being made
1472 2018-01-28 00:58:59 Most members of the 30-stock Dow make a big chunk of their money overseas. That means they should enjoy fatter profits thanks to the weaker dollar. The Dow's 3 best-performing stocks this year -- Boeing, Apple and Visa  rely on the U.S. for less than 55% of their total revenue.
1473 2018-01-28 00:58:48 Booming America! Jobs, jobs, jobs!! Growth! Higher Stocks! I know for all of you that didn’t believe a year ago its tough but dont miss the opportunity before is too late $$$$!
1474 2018-01-28 00:58:48 Higher oil, inflation. Weaker dollar, higher input costs. What does this mean for many consumer stocks?
1475 2018-01-28 00:58:08 Everybody piles in for the momentum trade ... oil and stocks.....which leads to more momentum until the train crashes. Timing ... when to jump off .... is key.

1479 2018-01-28 00:56:36 He wrote about ES, which means he's referring to stocks (well, that's an S&P 500 futures contract)

1486 2018-01-28 00:46:09 Most super rich vast majority of assets are invested in stocks and companies. Companies that create jobs and serve us. All in USA are in top 1percent of income bracket.
1487 2018-01-28 00:45:32 Steve Wynn us probably 80 or 85. Who cares. These rich guys are going to have women sign releases before they take their Dicks out! I'm sure this was about someone making a killing Shorting Wynn Stocks!
1488 2018-01-28 00:44:38 Yeah it's a problem finding good trades.  I set a limit per week of finding 5-10 stocks.
1489 2018-01-28 00:42:17 automatic weapons. Handguns should be enough unless you're a hunter. Bump stocks should be banned. Silencers should be mostly outlawed. Better background checks that are more thorough. But let's be honest here. Do you think some tighter laws would have stopped the last series?
1490 2018-01-28 00:38:38 @About_Finance Mr. Kolakowski, any additional stocks you can mention which meet your high ROIC criteria? Thanks!
1491 2018-01-28 00:34:54 I don’t know anything about picking stocks but I sure do know how to pick the locker at the gym right between two lockers that people will need to get into within 3.6 seconds of my getting changed.
1492 2018-01-28 00:34:36 @Eminem no disrespect cuz u my artist but trump has actually has helped the economy grow. unemployment is down and stocks are climbing. I ddnt vote for the guy but hes shown results
1493 2018-01-28 00:34:15 Or the fact the university won’t provide the materials to make it happen. You think all the WVU fans brought those shirts and light up stocks? I sit lower arena and yes older fans don’t get as rowdy, but you have to provide the supplies.
1494 2018-01-28 00:34:03 2018...Stocks won't earn more just because you pay more for them....and yet..
1495 2018-01-28 00:32:28 Wonder if Alex Iwobi stocks blue WKD's?
1496 2018-01-28 00:31:04 Fish stocks: Unlimited by-catch limits recovery.
1497 2018-01-28 00:27:53 Would be true for most stocks. There’s a bigger picture in play with the PR this week. Boustead institutional investors buying, accumulation climbing daily, big $ is loading this. CEO already stated Nasdaq. It’s trading to that tune. We shall see 
1498 2018-01-28 00:25:42 That's your reply? Was it pre-made? 
If you think it is void of fact then you have never looked at the stocks he owns in the companies that have helped destroy this nation. 
If that's not a vested interest, then what is?
1499 2018-01-28 00:25:01 ... lets look at a trio of casino stocks...
1500 2018-01-28 00:24:55 Can someone point me to a single god damn bookshop in Sydney that stocks Priestdaddy?
1501 2018-01-28 00:24:46 I'd have to start a boiler room to run more trades. Too many stocks to monitor as it is. Even with double my screens I still only have 2 eyes. I see 7 of everything on a busy da as it is. It's like jumping on a trampoline then trying to jump on the ground. It's wierd. Lol
1502 2018-01-28 00:19:14 First off he says he owns substantial amount of stocks in Facebook and Google, which is BAT competitors.

Secondly its 7 months old, mass adoption has already happened

Third, Google and Facebook ads have both been criticised past 6 months

Etc, this didn't age well...
1503 2018-01-28 00:18:59 "Value investing doesn’t always work. The market doesn’t always agree with you. Over time, value is roughly the way the market prices stocks, but over the short term, which sometimes can be as long as two or three years, there are periods when it doesn’t work"

Joel Greenblatt
1504 2018-01-28 00:18:44 A fine reminder, okay, I'll cover the casino stocks after energy...
1505 2018-01-28 00:18:26 I agree with that, but I don't think most people are willing to learn the basics around derisking a portfolio of individual stocks when they can take the comfortable fund gains even after fees.
1506 2018-01-28 00:16:52 Exactly. Wall st. is NOT Main Street. Reality is, stock market does well at the expense of main st. Operating overseas lowering cost 2 operate, stocks rise etc. Again Reality is, most American workers R & have been struggling 2 survive. Wages r low or stagnant, layoffs abound.
1507 2018-01-28 00:14:43 You can't help but wonder how different The Dark Knight Rises would feel if Bane used leverage and manipulation to fuck up Wayne stocks. 

Seems to tie back into my 'TDKR And Interstellar Are Secretly About The Stupidity Of Male Hubris' Theory.
1508 2018-01-28 00:13:53 For better or worse we are in a period of uncertainty. The more artificial stocks are the more the potential ceiling rises. We should not mistake that for a healthy system. I don't hold much for granted on a timescale beyond a year or two.
1509 2018-01-28 00:13:47 Why are big corperations buying back their stocks. Is so that they don't lose control of the businesses when this market comes down around tRumps ears. They must be afraid of hostile takeovers in the, future.
1510 2018-01-28 00:13:29 are your friends asking you to invest in crypto for them? would you like the ability to buy stocks on that same platform. read the white paper!! #GVT IS DOPE!!! $GVT #BTC #LTC #ADA
1511 2018-01-28 00:13:24 52% of Americans do NOT have stocks or 401k
1512 2018-01-28 00:12:37 Yes the stock market is going up, though I personally suspect a major crash in the future. However, most american families, DO NOT OWN STOCKS... so all of this is actually being profited on their backs.
1513 2018-01-28 00:11:55 @CFollowTheMoney I believe this is Carlos Reyes other personal twitter look  at the stocks and timing of tweets lives in Florida 90% sure
1514 2018-01-28 00:11:30 What really matters in the difference in PAYCHECKS people will be getting next month. bonuses. Stocks. Secure boarders. Racism in politics only exists when your trying to take down your opponent and MOST Americans get that.

Excited for my stocks <3
1518 2018-01-28 00:07:49 I'm sure you aren't buying new stocks all the time and you already have the portfolio built so how does it work for new subscribers wanting to build a portfolio?
1519 2018-01-28 00:07:07 I’m thinking, tar and feathers, stocks, running the gauntlet, forfeiture of property to the victims, etc. Nothing radical.
1520 2018-01-28 00:07:04 Blaming 'evil' is a great tactic because it means advocates don't have to take tangible action. Evil has always been around, right? WA State just banned bump stocks. Tangible. Not evil, just metal and plastic. You want evil? Witness the next school shooting w/out feeling outrage.
1521 2018-01-28 00:06:18 His job totals were less than Obama's last 6 years, stocks only help a minority of the country, while foreign nationals benefit the most, and President Obama deported more undocumented immigrants than any President in history. You need better claims. These did not work.
1522 2018-01-28 00:04:29 All the stocks she has are owned by Wall St. companies she swears she can't stand.
1523 2018-01-28 00:04:18 So jobs and growing economy record stocks stopping illegals mean nothing ? Just to name a few!!
1524 2018-01-28 00:04:03 What's your point? Im almost 6 years in ForEx, stocks and commodities and 1year in crypto, Twitter since 3 months
1525 2018-01-28 00:03:11 So I have two major watch lists, one for stocks, one for options trades. Another list of cryptocurrencies.

I've broken the stocks list into three. So altogether I have freaking FIVE lists. Haa ha ha!

I never even gotten to ETFs yet.

Its been a busy day.
1526 2018-01-28 00:03:06 Page 1 of momo trader's bible: buyers are always higher and sellers are always lower. True for stocks/doubly true for crypto. Many hedgies who are just watching BTC now would suddenly get very bullish a few thousand points higher, because to them, price is validation.
1527 2018-01-28 00:02:58 Ya. Problem is biggest stocks are such a high % of index. Hard to move index huge without top guys

1529 2018-01-28 00:01:33 Lmbooo Wynn Resorts is slowly taking this L. Plunged from 6% to 9% and now 11%. If you’re into buying casino stocks this is the perfect time.

1531 2018-01-28 00:00:32 true, it took me a while and a lot of books to master it. my main weakness has been seeing small caps stocks double or triple , so i’ve put 10% into these stocks to take advantage and reduce emotional response , so far it has worked

1562 2018-01-27 23:44:39 The high demand of live grouper in China is the main reason why the grouper stocks in Palawan have declined! And there were published studies about that in case you want proof.

1564 2018-01-27 23:42:24 Sergio, I am focused in early stage, do a lot of angel investments on @AngelList and have joined a couple of industry specific funds as an LP, such as @SpaceAngels and @drjennyrooke’s new fund, Genoa Ventures, focused in Biotech. No stocks, unless @SpaceX does an IPO :)

And who else to reap the benefits other than stockholders? It’s their risk being invested! #handouts

1592 2018-01-27 23:12:14 I don't care about them doing. I Keep my dividend first. If any one don't needs dinner? So sale stocks low. Me not.
1593 2018-01-27 23:12:11 Those same companies that turned around and laid off employees. 85+% of stocks are owned by the top 1% of wealthy Americans. They laid off employees to pconduct stock buybacks, bc the market is doing so well. Sorry, but that isn’t a thing to celebrate.

1598 2018-01-27 23:06:27 I will send you the info and explain how I do it. Only trick is I do ASX only as it's under-analyzed. I'll DM you the list and an explanation when I wake up properly. Schwab or Interactive Brokers can do Ozzie stocks.
1599 2018-01-27 23:04:18 Got it. Interesting. I hv an E-trade account too and buy my stocks using it. Having my complete portfolio in one? Yes!!
1600 2018-01-27 23:03:45 This new incentive will redirect significant fee revenue from non-IEX-listed stocks to make a tighter market in IEX-listed stocks. Many exchanges do similar things, and there's nothing wrong with it. But many of their complaints would apply, in my view

1609 2018-01-27 22:54:09 3 trading tips which might be useful:

1. Turn off Twitter (try it for a whole day)
2. Turn off CNN/any TV, it’s just noise
3. Try doing trade entries with your opposite hand, slows you down, better mental/application pace (this works!)

1663 2018-01-27 22:44:07 To me, this is the mindset that has led us to where we are now. Huge world stocks, prices in the tank,  living and dying by the commodity price, and focusing solely on yield disregarding quality for the most part. 2/2

1676 2018-01-27 22:29:28 Public ownership would require publicly traded companies in which the public can buy stocks which is capitalist which is voluntary or state owned companies run by boards chosen by the government (We have plenty of these they are fucking awful) which is not voluntary.

1685 2018-01-27 22:18:23 Say there is just 1 IEX-listed stock (e.g. WYNN), if you make the tier on that 1 stock, you get 1-2mils back on your volume on all other stocks.

1690 2018-01-27 22:11:09 Wrong.  It is a cornerstone of the bullish sentiment.  With access to export markets, the global energy complex is more stable due to diverse supply points.  Higher exports denotes greater global demand, while global stocks deplete and production is threatened due to reduced E&D.

1696 2018-01-27 22:06:15 Im one of the most optimistic people you’ll meet.  Told everyone I knew in 08 & 09 to buy buckets of stocks.  Believe it or not you had people shorting stocks after a 66% peak to trough.  Not to diff in IMO of those shorting vol now.
1697 2018-01-27 22:06:02 The only way it will not get into the economy is if you keep it in the mattress. 

A buyback puts it in the economy; dividend puts it in the economy; spending it on Goods puts it in the economy. Investing in stocks/bonds/cash, puts it in the economy.
1698 2018-01-27 22:05:07 The 6.94% might evaporate, but the long term gain depends on what happens financially. It's common for stocks to drop when a strong leader leaves, but rebound if the business does well. Wynn earnings growth was +66.79% last year. Projected 3% growth annually for the next 5 yrs
1699 2018-01-27 22:04:58 I bought 108 000 tgod stocks in the 3rd PP that came as you probably know with half a warrant tradable on ipo date. Any idea on warrant price?
1700 2018-01-27 22:04:20 What’s David Beckham got to do with an investment bank ?  Marketing madness - stick to selling funds , bonds and stocks
1701 2018-01-27 22:03:16 Stocks at record high; N-Power and School feeding programs;Jobs beginning to pick; More made in  in use; road/rail projects all over; No interference with NASS functions. No money sharing, politicians aren't used to it.
1702 2018-01-27 22:02:06 I don’t get you, America is working again, job market is on fire ,stocks are crazy, housing market is going crazy and all you can do is SULK. I am not sure there are meds for that.
1703 2018-01-27 22:01:27 Best to watch Zulu Dawn then......Rorkes Drift was the Blairite New Labour positive spin for the massacre at Isandlwana by stocks and fruit....in the mould of the miracle evacuation of Dunkirk....Boz
1704 2018-01-27 22:01:11 Well @meijer I try to support #union but u make it so difficult. I can't remember the last time I made a shopping trip with 100% success of all my items in stocks. Finally after waiting a week 4 my creamer 2 come back n stock? #Kroger
1705 2018-01-27 21:58:12 Hilarious lol ask him what was trading stocks back then
1706 2018-01-27 21:56:48 Realizin that if Future Biff had gone back in time to tell past Biff which stocks to invest in instead of giving him a magazine full of sports scores,Marty McFly wouldn't have been able to stop any of the Biffs.And the movie probably would've been a lot lamer. #BackToTheFutureII
1707 2018-01-27 21:55:25 It is hype. He probably got all of his rich friends to buy stocks
1708 2018-01-27 21:54:39 “The most valuable things in life are not financial, but e often don’t learn this until too late in life. 
The important things are not houses, lands, stocks & bonds or cars, but friendships, trust, 
confidence, empathy, mercy, love and faith.” Bertrand Russell
1709 2018-01-27 21:54:11 Where in Fayetteville stocks bottles of Viking? I don't know where to go now that Bob and Sheree's closed. Please don't leave me high and dry. @D9Brewing
1710 2018-01-27 21:53:53 Selfish answer. Remember what goes up comes down. Majority Americans  don’t have stocks. Trying to put a roof over their families head & feed them. Higher wages would help. Trump isn’t concerned about Working families. Obviously.
1711 2018-01-27 21:52:45 POTN screamed dip buy, I was locked and loaded but didn’t get filled. Im only focused on this one pattern of dips now. It also had support of 200ma on 5min which is typically a good bounce indicator on bullish stocks. Keep on grinding man!
1712 2018-01-27 21:52:28 We have been doing a lot of backtesting today on a variety of stocks while creating a nice watch list. A slimmed down watch list will be posted tonight or tomorrow.
1713 2018-01-27 21:48:55 Could buy 10k worth of marijuana stocks to make money to travel the world, or I could buy 10k worth of marijuana and send myself to the fucking moon right now.
1714 2018-01-27 21:48:43 "George Soros calls Facebook and Google a 'menace' to society and 'obstacles to innovation' in blistering attack"

Well, well... What we have here. Reptiloids are angry because of loses from shorting tech stocks too?  Truly hated bull market.
1715 2018-01-27 21:47:53 Yeah I have most of my stocks with HL. The trading fees and exchange rates are pretty bad though.
1716 2018-01-27 21:47:44 For example stocks go up when companies cut jobs. I just hope it’s not as bad as it was 10 yrs ago. I’ll never forget that as long as I live. A ton of ppl forgot and think it isn’t happening again
1717 2018-01-27 21:47:34 IMO New money and cryptonoobs are looking at the buying options like stocks. Getting advice from CNBC and looking for a good buy on a cheap stock and seeing BTC as unaffordable Berkshire Hathaway. But I could be full of shit too
1718 2018-01-27 21:47:30 @parishilton but it's about the actie ectie octie igzie uctzie, what is it, yea, in german the common duck is the stock duck, so, it's about the stocks, in english, these are jurisdically safe, ok. it's about the stock duck market. they are safe, that's all that counts.
1719 2018-01-27 21:46:44 That’s because the top 10%  owns 80% of the stocks.
1720 2018-01-27 21:46:09 Stock market doesn’t get affected until it hits the fan last time for proof. And ppl think because stock market is doing well ppl are doing well that’s bullshit not many working class ppl invest in stocks. Stock market prosperity isn’t state of the economy
1721 2018-01-27 21:40:28 Bigbird plays these 2007/08-like stocks. Times will change. Value will be key. He wont say good bye when he deletes twitter, broke, cryin.
1722 2018-01-27 21:39:40 This market is for rich people. Who  can afford to buy stocks at this ridiculous cost?  Hold on to your money, and when the market crashes, but buy buy.
1723 2018-01-27 21:38:13 I don’t know about you but I’m still waiting for an entry point
1724 2018-01-27 21:38:10 Sorry.. Just realised I’m on Coins Exchange - not Stocks Exchange... 
1725 2018-01-27 21:37:38 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-01-26, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (3/6):

1727 2018-01-27 21:36:30 Heard on the radio "I wish I'd invested in Boeing January of last year" you're a moron you should have invested in Boeing a decade ago #Boeing #hedgefunds #stocks
1728 2018-01-27 21:36:27 Hmm not a good sign imo
1729 2018-01-27 21:35:53 The pace stocks of Bangladesh, and even Zimbabwe U19s, look promising. Good signs for world cricket.
1730 2018-01-27 21:34:15 I need these stocks to start trending in my favor
1731 2018-01-27 21:33:34 McWhorter is a fave of mine too. If you have audible or a library that stocks the Great Courses, he has several lecture series that are well worth a listen.
1732 2018-01-27 21:33:00 Tom Price wouldn't like that! his stocks.
1733 2018-01-27 21:31:40 Ma mom picks would be mast or 10 for dundee. And stocks or mosey for fife.

1737 2018-01-27 21:29:43 Firework in altcoins vs Bitcoin means crush of Bitcoin vs USD

BTC prices of altcoins are bullshit same as to count the price of apple stocks in microsoft stock units
1738 2018-01-27 21:29:19 OMG I WASN’T EVEN THINKING ABOUT THE BAIL but I mean David did put 1 million on his Tesla stocks so.... but it would be between Liza or Jason because Liza would probably feel bad so she would bail him out
1739 2018-01-27 21:28:44 OT underway!! Bloodoff stocks n young for fife.
1740 2018-01-27 21:26:28 2 of my favs who were overlooked all week @seniorbowl Mike White and Rashad Penny balled out! stocks on the rise. #Browns @Browns why is nobody talking about these cats?
1741 2018-01-27 21:26:09 3nunso ny3 bad. Tilapia di3 3y3. But consider stocks too.

1745 2018-01-27 21:22:44 Been using @RobinhoodApp for stocks, really happy about this move to include crypto. Can’t wait.
1746 2018-01-27 21:21:30 Yep same goes for me $uav $akr $n $rks $gsi $sft all are good at communication. $n is the best by far though kory and sean replies to all emails and phonecalls. Also they do a live stream every wednesday at 4:20 never missed one yet great insight and info
1747 2018-01-27 21:20:18 Most of his voters do not purchase stocks.
In reality he just helped the elite get 7 trillion.
1748 2018-01-27 21:20:11 Great article, I been in market for 3 years an almost double my money in good blue chip An taken risks that didn't work out, the right stocks An market run is the key
1749 2018-01-27 21:19:47 Nice image of mainland fire fighter. Stocks of Tas fire fighters limited?
1750 2018-01-27 21:19:41 @AliExpressFr 2 commandes que je passe et deux produits différents Merci de faire le nécéssaire auprès de vos vendeurs. Est ce fait exprès pour débarasser les stocks?
1751 2018-01-27 21:17:50 If you make the tiers on IEX-listed stocks, you get 1-2mils back for every share traded on other stocks. If your total volume is 100x your IEX-listed volume, you could get the equivalent of a 100-200mil rebate for quoting those stocks
1752 2018-01-27 21:17:24 For years there have been problems with the housing market , it’s nothing new.  HA homes should be halted and council houses should be built and remain council houses. HAs are holding too much cash .Stocks were lost during the right to buy .... but you can’t have it both ways.
1753 2018-01-27 21:14:30 There are other coins than btc. And who will go back to stocks after touching the crypto ??? ;-)
1754 2018-01-27 21:14:18 All this correlation is making crypto prices feel a lot more like stocks/indexes/funds/wall street driven equities.
1755 2018-01-27 21:13:12 The new law simply makes US competitive with the rest of the world.  It also allows US to hire more and pay more to US employees.  You obviously don’t understand how to run a business.  Finally, companies are owned by employees thru 401K retirement funds.  Stocks at record highs!
1756 2018-01-27 21:13:02 Israel Technology Stocks Log Best Year Since Dot-com Boom. nine out of the 10 biggest showing double-digit gains and only one, CyberArk, showing an actual loss for the year – about 9%. #tech#startupcapital
1757 2018-01-27 21:12:54 It's not "leading" to anything Charlie. Stocks, bonds, and housing are already in massive bubbles. Will become clear in hindsight.
1758 2018-01-27 21:12:52 Stocks only up because of buybacks. 
Only rich getting richer.
Get a educated russian lover.
1759 2018-01-27 21:10:26 Gaz gets a nice goal after the pass from Stocks and Hazlet 1-0 Eagles!!!
1760 2018-01-27 21:10:16 Bitcoin is not like stocks. Bitcoin is a different animal. Stocks don't go up 10X on average every year, Bitcoin does. Satoshi Nakamoto was a crappy programmer, but a genius mathematician and a genius inventor.
1761 2018-01-27 21:10:14 @Btrover1977 (460 follows)
Sign up for #Robinhood to invest in #Bitcoin and #stocks, and we’ll both get a #free #stock like Apple, Ford...
1762 2018-01-27 21:09:51 Ppl that pay for advertisement are getting fucked, FB n Twitter stocks will take a dive
1763 2018-01-27 21:08:50 Buy $AERM
At .06¢ was at $3 not that long ago
Market cap$100,000 you'll have to do the nasty-stocks exchange
1764 2018-01-27 21:08:03 @HilaryKramer I'm a growth stock picker of over 30 yrs (81 yrs old) that uses data from IBD, MktSmith, Thomson-Reuter, L. Navellier & ChartLabPRO for stocks to meet my benchmarks to buy, to hold, or sell. I do it for myself & my Investment Club monthly. Am I on the right track?
1765 2018-01-27 21:06:36 stocks and crypto... Being bought by millennials that don't have no money and using credit cards to pay for investments. The next crash should be epic
1766 2018-01-27 21:05:38 Investors should purchase stocks like they purchase groceries, not like they purchase perfumes 
#BenGraham
1767 2018-01-27 21:04:23 He only stepped down because he stocks started dropping like water in a waterfall. Otherwise he would still be there. When it starts affecting their money, people get pissed. The only way it ever happens.
1768 2018-01-27 21:03:01 I seriously doubt that will happen. Stocks will have to keep plummeting and I don't think anyone's attention span is that long. I think we've all become numb.
1769 2018-01-27 21:02:08 Ok, let me correct my original statement... Looks like a P&D, but if it's not their was probably news leaked. Just look at the chart. Stocks don't just go up 1500% in two days for no reason. I saw someone announce it on twitter, then saw a few more, and more. 1/2
1770 2018-01-27 21:02:03 ...Based on Crime, WEAK on Stocks and fulfill their ratings were thrilled to our great Military hostage over the Senate Intel
1771 2018-01-27 21:01:39 When im hungover af and mom talking to me about stocks and investing #chill
1772 2018-01-27 21:00:20 1/ Respectfully disagree. There can’t be hand-holding every step of the way. Are there requirements for stocks that would be considered speculative? Are there requirements (besides age) for stepping into a casino? This is on Robinhood IMO to properly warn of risks...
1773 2018-01-27 20:59:35 like more simple headers that actually use shapes and patterns instead of headers using 10684924 effects and stocks
1774 2018-01-27 20:58:45 I am probably a annoying shareholder.

Almost everything I buy as a possibly a long hold I try and make contact. 

If they don’t respond I am not near as interested. Especially for stocks on CSE or Venture. Seems very important to me. 

I don’t expect the CEO respond but someone
1775 2018-01-27 20:58:30 He is so far ahead, brilliant @realDonaldTrump
1776 2018-01-27 20:57:22 FACT: Bear Markets last on average—1 to 2 Years. Bull Markets last 5 to 9 Years. The Bias—is Always to Buy Stocks. This Bull Market—Will Break All records!  #TrumpParadigmShift
1777 2018-01-27 20:56:33 He still owns most of the stocks.
1778 2018-01-27 20:55:43 Yea they called me to offer i promo after i cancelled which means they care about customers and retention i told them my feedback and they mentioned no plans for app at the moment
1779 2018-01-27 20:55:37 What could go wrong with #Robinhood offering free crypto trading somehow. Getting 800k sign ups. And yet it’s not even been blessed by the SEC. nor explained where they will buy and hold all these coins. Which are pot stocks or ETFs and behave very differently.
1780 2018-01-27 20:55:24 no stocks used
1781 2018-01-27 20:55:03 Most people Obama's policies hurt don't own stocks. And THEY are the reason @POTUS is president and she isn't.  Her elitist crowd wasn't powerful enough to take down our country. Thank God! #GodBlessAmerica
1782 2018-01-27 20:53:54 Can We make Money—Strategically Shorting the Markets?—Yes—But Why work that hard.  The Bias—Is ALWAYS  to “Buy” Stocks.   #MarketTimer
1783 2018-01-27 20:53:32 Look at these SICKulars & Minority Appeasers, such is their hate for BJP/Modi that they can bloody imbibe any nonsense and bunch of lies (even if it's against the Nation) as long as it goes against Mr. Modi. 

These 10 Janpath darbaris in the garb of Journalism r laughing stocks
1784 2018-01-27 20:52:52 Not sure about password policies but Degiro are worth a look if picking stocks and Vanguard directly for ETFs. Vanguard do ISAs.
1785 2018-01-27 20:52:21 $IFXY is for those that "missed out" on huge runs of Bitcoin and Pot Stocks for all those that didn't get in early and became rich $IFXY is YOUR CHANCE NOW to be in it to win it and still "very early" perfect to get in now! 
1786 2018-01-27 20:50:39 Not agree from France chère t'm trading stocks he la Simply the best
1787 2018-01-27 20:50:36 This is my opinion only as is all my Tweets about Penny Stocks are for educational purposes only not buy or sell advice do your own research always! I have to state that every now and then.
1788 2018-01-27 20:50:33 Notice the correlation between anaesthetists and them being cycling fans (bike clips)? ... wonder if they also have stocks in whichever brand makes brown pants?!
1789 2018-01-27 20:49:32 You can also participate in lottery pools have tried it for a couple months and won a few dollars i want the app more than expansion the webpage is hard to use on mobile
1790 2018-01-27 20:48:58 Should be investing in stocks 
1791 2018-01-27 20:48:58 Jan... 30% of US stocks are owned off-shore, so those profits go there. Most Americans -50%+ - don't even have $400 for an emergency repair. FIFTY PERCENT. Income inequality is a serious problem in America.

So please, get off that high horse you're on.
1792 2018-01-27 20:48:50 Feel good legislation.  Bump stocks are nothing more than eye candy. They are virtually useless when it comes to accuracy. On the other hand 5 minutes with a metal file in the right hands, fully automatic.
1793 2018-01-27 20:48:18 @CNBCFastMoney @MelissaLeeCNBC @GuyAdami @timseymour @BKBrianKelly @SteveGrassoCNBC @k_finerman Please take sometime next week to discuss value stocks as a means to balancing risk in portfolios.  It seems that every asset class is overpriced or like utilities no good news ahead!
1794 2018-01-27 20:47:10 You know after twitter jail they just straight put you in the stocks, right?
1795 2018-01-27 20:46:58 Yeah, but he stocks up on Aqua Amore – $37 per bottle – because it's the least impure water Comrade Sanders deigns to bathe in.
1796 2018-01-27 20:46:31 Announcement For Shine Saga: There will be a special bracket for Shine Saga under the name of 20XX! Taking place before Singles, 20XX has a few special rules:
- Only FD, Battlefield, or PS2
- Fox or Falco
- Four Stocks, Eight Minutes

Hope to see you all at Shine Saga!
1797 2018-01-27 20:45:22 I use this and it is magnificent. NO COMMISSIONS on trades! Also they cap free stocks when you hit $500 worth of free stock rewards for referrals... so when you max out you could start sending people my way! just saying... :D
1798 2018-01-27 20:42:29 Never understood or taught about stocks... but curious
1799 2018-01-27 20:41:34 It's not apples to apples.

These markets have different risks, currency valuations (which may not fully account for inflation/cpi/interest differences), rules behind the benchmark indices, etc.

In general, an expected huge corporate tax break will advance stocks.
1800 2018-01-27 20:41:14 "In sum, Mr. Womack didn’t make anything complicated out of the stock market. He taught me that you can’t be buying stocks every day, week or month of the year and make a profit, any more than you could plant rice every day, week or month and make a crop." John Train (1978)
1801 2018-01-27 20:40:04 LIVERPOOL are laughing stocks really we defend shit with shit players n a shit captain doing nothing in da transfer market sold our best player losing at home to pardew
1802 2018-01-27 20:40:04 Lynch used to say he knew something was up when people started telling him what to do in stocks at parties
1803 2018-01-27 20:39:36 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
1804 2018-01-27 20:39:24 Spent
1805 2018-01-27 20:39:22 コインチェックやるじゃん。
1806 2018-01-27 20:39:13 If so, the question would be”why?”
1807 2018-01-27 20:38:07 Yeah, they are also promoting their fast bowlers too much. At a time it used to be a norm for our bowlers to be bowling at 140+ and Indians were way down in terms of fast bowling stocks. Today 4/5 of their bowlers bowled 140+. Plus that 18 year old guy was paid in crores.
1808 2018-01-27 20:37:19 $HMPQ SO PISSED OFF AT THIS SHITTY SCAM OUTFIT AKA #OTCmarkets THEY FORCE COMPANIES TO PAY THEM FILING FEES OR ELSE THEY SLAP A  ON THEM! PEOPLE THAT TRADE PENNY STOCKS SHOULD CARE LESS ABOUT UP 2 DATE FILINGS YOUR NOT INVESTING LONG TERM SO WHO CARES IF THEIR CURRENT
1809 2018-01-27 20:37:17 This wouldn't have happened at a nice store, but for some reason Walmart only stocks xxxL and the Smalls are actually larges, so you will be seeing me in the kids department I guess.
1810 2018-01-27 20:37:10 But unconventional monetary policy has no other means of transmission than through asset holders. I think Bernanke and Yellen pulled 3 decades worth of demand forward/stole from the future. Once tax cut effects are priced in, stocks top, bonds are a huge buy.  Might be 6+ months
1811 2018-01-27 20:36:43 No?
1812 2018-01-27 20:34:36 speculation：the buying, holding, and selling of stocks for short periods of time to make money from price fluctuations　投機
1813 2018-01-27 20:32:52 YOUR move, Mrs Romney McDaniel!
1814 2018-01-27 20:31:02 GOAL FLYERS!!! STOCKTON!!! Jorgenson with the set up skates in round the back n plays it to stocks whos headin for the crease. 3-2
1815 2018-01-27 20:30:33 IMO, we will never have another liquidity event again.  The Fed has rationalized that intervening/making asset holders richer is worth it.  With that being said, I think everyone is about (within 3 qtrs) to go all in & that will signal the top for stocks & bond yields.
1816 2018-01-27 20:30:02 Love how Twitter stocks went up on Friday. If only someone could buy GoPro...
1817 2018-01-27 20:29:51 Asia is awake stocks going green #BTS

1819 2018-01-27 20:26:19 There's only one bottle of wine in the house, and I fear that wouldn't be enough. Maybe I'll try it when stocks are more healthy.
1820 2018-01-27 20:25:17 my one supreme purchase has a 230% ROI, my lesson here is don't invest in bitcoin or stocks, invest in hypebeast purchases
1821 2018-01-27 20:24:10 This is my exact fear, I’m dumping a ton of money in 401k, Roth, Stocks because I don’t want to be like my parents, 70 and still working, but then I think I’ll die at 50 and have wasted my life working. 
1822 2018-01-27 20:23:31 Ways to make money/save in 2018:
Fix your credit
Invest in stocks
Start a small business
Use a rebate app like ibotta 
Use a credit card with cash back rewards
Refer friends to services that give cash/credit back on services
Reevaluate your 401k setup
1823 2018-01-27 20:20:27 If my boy wasn’t so impatient he would’ve banked on the stocks picks i gave him

1834 2018-01-27 20:10:16 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1835 2018-01-27 20:10:10 Stocks (esp. cyclical ones), precious metals, industrial commodities, TIPS (depending on rates move) tend to outperform in rising inflation environments. Given the sharp increase in most of those assets lately I feel like mining stocks might still have upside potential...
1836 2018-01-27 20:09:46 and one of these days he'll be asking why stocks are going down
1837 2018-01-27 20:09:45 Happy b day man!

1840 2018-01-27 20:07:22 what scale is this? stocks trade billions of shares per day and combined DARTs at TD and ETFC are around 1M. the right axis is misleading.

1845 2018-01-27 20:02:47 I'm not unsure, he doesn't understand the modern NHL. He alienates his young players, stocks his roster with aged, two-way Forwards who get absurd deals and he thinks a rebuild takes 10-15 years.

1851 2018-01-27 19:56:43 Flipping properties is the real estate version of day trading stocks. Both are risky approaches to investing. Neither method generates passive income.

1858 2018-01-27 19:48:35 Investing through Canadian stocks, or...?
1859 2018-01-27 19:47:46 Bar is quite low when the Dow dipped to 6400 & change in October 2008. Market lost 54%of value from Oct. 2007.  Those who rode it out, or doubled down & moved assets into stocks have seen a near 20,000 point Dow index gain. Buy low, sell high.
1860 2018-01-27 19:47:45 After pocketing a $5 billion tax cut from the GOP Tax Scam, Pfizer decided to end all of its Alzheimer's and Parkinson's research. Then they did exactly as it was predicted, they fired 300 scientists and used that money to buy back their stocks.

1864 2018-01-27 19:45:26 I have used lotogopher in california personally it is cool since you dont have to buy in local store but i wish they had a mobile app which they dont also financials are not that great but good potential
1865 2018-01-27 19:45:20 Possibly if stocks started dropping along with #gold and #silver.  Time will tell if #bitcoin could be viewed as an alternative to declining stocks.
1866 2018-01-27 19:45:12 I've only just seen this. I was in about an hour ago and grabbed one from the DOOM section. Your Stones Throw stocks are looking good! Thanks!
1867 2018-01-27 19:44:55 Noted.i will keep it in mind.However Greece is a great comeback story and certain stocks are extremely discounted in relation to their european peers
1868 2018-01-27 19:44:32 This year

1870 2018-01-27 19:44:00 Cause it doesn’t happen often
1871 2018-01-27 19:43:32 Hang around financial analysts and stock brokers. They say things like, Stocks are dead, & No one buys companies anymore. It’s all about fancified products. Of course they’re all assholes. #nooneknowsanything
1872 2018-01-27 19:43:20 It's good but you should have added so me more color and stocks
1873 2018-01-27 19:41:44 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
1874 2018-01-27 19:40:37 R118.36 (26/01/2018)....a share price is the price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks in a company...basically when you buy you own a portion of the company.
For u to make money the share price value must grow above the time you bought.
1875 2018-01-27 19:40:16 Hah lol, y’all just can’t deal with losing.
1876 2018-01-27 19:38:38 I’d say that’s pretty dang good but go celebrate this victory Ik Ncstate fans don’t get to do this to often
1877 2018-01-27 19:38:36 If these programs were stocks, which would you be inclined to buy?  Two have historically troubled programs. One has stayed above the fray
1878 2018-01-27 19:37:42 32-4 now
1879 2018-01-27 19:37:35 What about gold and stocks and oil?
1880 2018-01-27 19:37:11 Good game tho i have nothing to hang my head about 2 teams going at it Ncstate just came out on top today
1881 2018-01-27 19:36:47 He is accurate...stocks are up by almost 40%

1884 2018-01-27 19:34:29 If we are living in the present, you just lost bud.

1887 2018-01-27 19:33:32 I guess smoking can kill is also objected to by @ndtv what a bunch of you know whats. Where do these intellectual so called journalists collect their brains from? They excel in making laughing stocks of themselves much like their masters. Hilarious Jokers
1888 2018-01-27 19:33:24 And stocks?
1889 2018-01-27 19:32:39 Live in the present, take your defeat and go home. Learn how to lose with some dignity.

1892 2018-01-27 19:30:28 So... My puff can beat Foxes with 1 or 2 stocks remaining. But my Falcon can beat Foxes with 3 stocks or more remaining... And it cooler to main falcon... Should I main falcon?
1893 2018-01-27 19:28:06 Thanks President, I’m investing more on defense stocks...:D
1894 2018-01-27 19:26:17 @sherbn Hi Al, based on my watchlist, a decreasing list of HV is shrinking and the increasing HV list is growing.  Do you think this market will take a pause soon based on the less stocks with HV declining?
1895 2018-01-27 19:26:03 Well, it is now true, since stocks only go parabolically up now with no pullbacks, just like the image implies.
1896 2018-01-27 19:25:20 Do we really know this? So far there seems to be a correlation in liquidity between stocks and bitcoin. If the market crashes, people pull cash out of the lowest hanging fruit first. Bitcoin may be that.
1897 2018-01-27 19:20:58 $uav connect the dots
-Uav issues 1.5 million options to thomas yingling
-thomas yingling is ceo of berkwood resources
-berkwood resources sources pioneer aerial for their uav mag survey
Now thomas yingling has a vested interest in global uav

Your thoughts?
1898 2018-01-27 19:19:23 The biggest lie you are told is that humans are created equal. That isn't even remotely true. Einstein is more valuable than bill who stocks shelves. If giving the option of which one to save, then Einstein would be saved every time.
1899 2018-01-27 19:19:19 It's real, I've been using the app for trading for a bit over a month now.  Easy way to really learn how to buy and sell stocks. Most of the free stocks are lower cost stuff and they likely make way more long term by brining people in to the app.

1902 2018-01-27 19:14:41 i was supposed to buy a mang passport case but the seller have no more stocks, his was the cutest design :-(
1903 2018-01-27 19:14:41 The last 6-7 weeks of the market have been truly phenomenal for me.  I took some profits yesterday. Closed out 1/2f my position on a  leveraged EFT that invests in Chinese stocks. Gain was over 100% in less than a year. Not sure how far this goes but I'm still in. Halfway.
1904 2018-01-27 19:14:09 Thanks. I can/will simulate it by not touching profits at any cost and have a cap on the $ amount that I can use for trading options. as you mentioned before in one  posts, some surplus money will buy stocks from ur safe exponential growth list than trading options.
1905 2018-01-27 19:13:36 Oh same. But Fortnite stocks on our campus are somehow rising.
1906 2018-01-27 19:13:07 the #DJIA increased 38.0% over the 306 trading days leading to its record high in January 2000

it then fell and didn't reach a new record high for over seven years

1907 2018-01-27 19:12:50 Tons of dumb $ flowing into low vol etf’s & funds.  Managers will keep buying just like those managers that did when they kept getting billions to buy aaa junk mortgages or tech stocks or oil.

1921 2018-01-27 19:05:50 It will also depend on what you want in retirement/how close you are to retirement. If you plan on just living off the dividends you may want an average yield of 3.5%+ but if you plan on selling stock then you will want growth stocks as well.
1922 2018-01-27 19:05:11 CAN US government own stocks? Why not? Lots of pensions are invested in stocks. Maybe instead of cash, government hold stocks? Well, then conflict of interest? 
1923 2018-01-27 19:04:47 Ion be tryna fuck with stocks and bonds because I need to be in control of my losses. Smh
1924 2018-01-27 19:02:25 Check 1996 and 2004 when smaller but similar laws were passed. Guess what? The corporations bought back stock and paid dividends and their stocks soared. This is historical , not theoretical
1925 2018-01-27 19:01:30 If the 10yr settles around 3, and no more raises, we're going to see some of that money come out of stocks and into bonds.

1957 2018-01-27 18:53:30 Just be careful of high div yield stocks. They may offer low growth on the principal and low growth on the dividend. Its possible the dividend may not grow or be cut if the payout ratio is near 100%
1958 2018-01-27 18:51:27 Wait a minute you're claiming you don't have stocks?
1959 2018-01-27 18:51:27 No seas pelotudo Recalde..realmente pensas que es economico tener todos aviones diferentes?? Claramente sos un pelotudo e inutil..stocks de repuestos de diferentes aviones, capacitación de pilotos, etc etc. Llamate al silencio inutil de mierda.!
1960 2018-01-27 18:51:18 Truly, watching retail money absolutely FLOOD Into the market, proves the phase, there is nothing new in the game of stock speculation. Rebalance, add some bonds, defensive, recessionary stocks.
1961 2018-01-27 18:50:48 It's understandable that RE is the best collateral but most big banks value stocks at a 2 : 1 and bonds at 1.25 : 1 as collateral (obviously cash is good) but can't give you a straight answer why RE is 100%+ but avg GTA price just dropped 15%+ in 8 months

1964 2018-01-27 18:47:25 Ha! The stock market does not equate to the economy. Our economy has not improved. Unemployment is not down. Unless you invest in stocks not everyone is making money.  Btw, investing in the SM is down 11%. 35% of investors are foreign businesses/investors-does not benefit America
1965 2018-01-27 18:47:09 My stocks did great under Obama. If yours didn't, bad investment choices in a prolonged bull market are to blame... not Obama
1966 2018-01-27 18:46:39 The suckers aren't even in boring ass stocks anymore they are chasing even dumber things.
1967 2018-01-27 18:45:21 Very true, I wrote this a while ago when these stocks were 4-5x cheaper. This is more just about day to day price drops. If or when the bubble bursts then that will be a different story, but just as important

1973 2018-01-27 18:41:29 I'm new to stocks. I would like to ask what will be the effect in terms of the stock price if the company's par value changes? Thank you Sir @marvingermo!

1995 2018-01-27 18:22:05 You can try FNG. That one weights the FAANG stocks pretty high and I do know Tweeter is in there also and its weighted pretty good also.
1996 2018-01-27 18:20:31 Just check the stock graphs since the next day after the election. Stocks rose from 2009-2014 bec. they crashed in once in 50 yrs lows, because of QE (which funded buybacks) and slow recovery. As soon as QE stopped, stocks started to slowdown and resumed since Nov16.

1998 2018-01-27 18:20:04 You could say the same for all stocks right now.  Those walls are what control investor emotions.  Once the emotions are gone those walls don't stand a chance.  This is what happens everytime.  Nothing new.

2012 2018-01-27 18:12:42 ETF is an exchange traded fund....a type of stock mutual fund where you purchase shares on a stock exchange rather than through the mutual fund company. Most of the big ETF are index funds like the ticker SPDR (an ETF that holds shares of the S&P 500 largest stocks).
2013 2018-01-27 18:12:01 No, no, no... Hundreds of Billions in tax cuts to corporations, where SOME of those companies are passing on a tiny fraction of their permanent savings as a 1 time bonus, while MOST are just going to buy back stocks and/or increase dividends.

2016 2018-01-27 18:06:21 Starbucks is a corporate business and is probably one of the most professional restaurants to work for. We get stocks, health insurance, college aid (if we go to ASU), paid vacations, and at least 4 people per store are full-time (40+ hrs/ week). We deserve paid sick leave.
2017 2018-01-27 18:05:33 About 30% of stocks are owned by Foreigners. That is close to one third. The tax break we citizens of the US will pay for is going straight into their pockets. Stupid!
2018 2018-01-27 18:05:23 Comparing all crypto to penny stocks may be a little harsh. A majority of them may fit the bill. Maybe take a look at a project like EOS and see what kind of backing they are getting. Rolling over $1B into applications and startups built on their platform. Hardly penny stockish

2037 2018-01-27 17:52:38 I listened to the podcast. I was curious because you said you take less than a percentage of risk on your stock picks, but then you said you had about 20 stocks. Are you saying you are 80% cash or am I misunderstanding? @LMT978

2041 2018-01-27 17:49:39 Im not against trying it...I get the attractive risk/reward setup...just out of my comfort zone since I can't trade it thru a real brokerage account except for now being able to trade futures. Penny stocks have amazing risk/reward too and I don't buy them.

After 2 yrs. of buying stocks off the firms trading desk (Ill Liquid under 20 mil mkt caps I might add) I wanted the other side of this whole stock thingy, other than the buy em sell em and move on to the next idea that was bred into new brokers here.
2043 2018-01-27 17:47:08 @AskRobinhood Hi, the today summary shown on the main page is way less than actual gain for the day from all the stocks. Why is this difference? Where is my money that i gained?
2044 2018-01-27 17:45:07 (2/2) I invest when I believe the conditions... are probably not permanent... you can’t be short-term oriented with this investment philosophy. If you’re going to worry about short-term volatility, you’re just not going to be able to buy the cheapest stocks. -- Rich Pzena

2052 2018-01-27 17:38:36 Paper money.   Huge corporate profits.   This is like a corp game of cooking their books.   $500 in stocks is nothing.  Private healthcare  cost $1,000/month.  We call this in our business “window dressing”.  Hypocrites
2053 2018-01-27 17:38:26 Exactly- because the stocks went up but companies still laid off employees.

2056 2018-01-27 17:35:15 These are not just cryptocurrencies and ICO's (although definitely some scams) for the sake of it. These are like IPO's in penny stocks in companies with viable applications. The coins will be used to participate in the applications network.

You are all crooked, but nice try in trying to make Trump look bad. Numbers don’t lie and he’s doing really well with jobs, Economy, stocks, and global trade.
2058 2018-01-27 17:33:27 I think it's a thing with me to keep adding new stocks rather than adding to successful existing positions, I know I would have seen greater gains if I had topped up more. I am holding around thirty stocks across sips and isa's which is too many. A good spring clean beckons.
2059 2018-01-27 17:29:21 The stocks and shares mindset doesn’t work so well here. Under all the get-rich-quick noise it’s an S shaped technology adoption curve. The bitcoin price chart is basically repeating hype bubble cycles superimposed on an long S adoption curve.
2060 2018-01-27 17:28:05 The question: is this just the beginning of heading back closer to “trend growth” in which case stocks r much cheaper than they appear OR we are close to “as good as it gets” and some point this year is a “rut-roh” moment? :)

2068 2018-01-27 17:21:41 Energy stocks have been known to lead, but for the two to diverge after this extended of a rally says energy stock investors aren't buying the recent move in oil & my guess is they're waiting for an oil PB to buy & think the R/R is bad here.

2095 2018-01-27 17:03:56 I need to make more bets like this (other than stock market investing in climate sensitive stocks).  Seems like easy money/food.
2096 2018-01-27 17:03:34 Just listened to rebelfm. Nvidia stocks have definitely went up (122% in the last year) but like you alluded to, it must be unrelated since amd stock is trippin
2097 2018-01-27 17:03:27 Everyone who has an IRA, most any other retirement account or investment account will benefit from the corporate tax reductions.
Believe approximately 60 million Americans own stocks.
Plus reinvestment of profits creates new jobs.
Far more than just the rich benefit!
2098 2018-01-27 17:01:12 Completely anecdotal but I think they go much higher before hurting stocks, like 4-4.5 on 10 yr. Fitting pats r in SB as this markets theme song should be crazy train
2099 2018-01-27 17:01:00 #Electric #Car #EV are #Wonderful But More Needs To Be Done With Work Commercial Vehicles #SchoolBuses #Trucks Etc That's where #Adomani Inc. #ADOM comes in with their #Impressive retro-fitted electric drivetrain after the holiday volitivity the stocks will surge
2100 2018-01-27 17:00:43 30 biggest companies control Wall Street. Stocks go up or down. Another 500 companies called S&P 500 can't do their regular stocks trade.
2101 2018-01-27 16:59:00 Donc là on a des gens qui croient dur comme fer que du Nutella serait contaminé au Lactalis. 
Déjà.
What the fuck 1 - Pourquoi des produits Lactalis seraient dedans ?
What the fuck 2 - Ils pensent qu'un industriel écoulerait ses stocks en promo massivement en le sachant ?
2102 2018-01-27 16:58:50 Seems to me like you did not due proper due dilligence, or the people you communicated with are just slow. Either way, saying stocks are dead is clearly idiotic.
2103 2018-01-27 16:58:42 Depends on what the goal is. If your goal is to pump your stocks so you can dump your holdings on someone with strong FOMO, than it's smart. If your goal is to stay in the #Blockchain niche for the long haul, then you'd better have a plan or you're dumb.
2104 2018-01-27 16:56:07 The same people preaching about how good the stock market is don't even invest in stocks
2105 2018-01-27 16:55:46 Ok Norman... i will stop replying to your tweets regarding cannabis unless it's totally out of line...we know stocks are finding their footing with valuations and mergers but no public bashing... take care and careful investing
2106 2018-01-27 16:54:49 I had a lecture on Dogecoin. It’s good because it’s “cheap”. And $1000 could turn into $500000 with some luck. (Serious). Reminded me of people buying dotxom@stuff because cheaper stocks move higher faster 
2107 2018-01-27 16:53:10 People like safety. No one wants anything that has a chance to go down. People like gold, as they see people around them wear it. When a day comes whr, everyone around owns a portfolio, then people will buy stocks too like gold.
As of now people earning 50k, don't care 3k SIP.
2108 2018-01-27 16:53:00 Yet these families lose their jobs & the nation's sick will suffer because of #GOPTaxScam.

After pocketing a $5 billion tax cut from the GOP Tax Scam, Pfizer ended  its Alzheimer's & Parkinson's research. Then they fired 300 scientists & used that $$ to buy back their stocks.
2109 2018-01-27 16:52:47 87.2% of annual flux is from plants and soils. But nearly 100% of new additions to the flux are from human emissions. Must differentiate between stocks and flows like difference between balance sheet and cash flow statement in finance.
2110 2018-01-27 16:52:19 Really don't think it matters. As soon as bonds move appreciably lower markets going even more ballistic. Investors haven't faced this set up in bonds since '66. When losses on " safe" bonds come to fruition it'll be a stampede into stocks
2111 2018-01-27 16:52:03 @Amber_Stocks
2112 2018-01-27 16:51:26 Right, because everyone has stocks on the S&P. Not to mention Trump's job numbers not as good as Obama and many corporations are laying off thousands of workers.
2113 2018-01-27 16:51:05 Guy, they haven't even received the tax cut money yet, so how did they use it to buy back stocks?
2114 2018-01-27 16:50:46 @prestonjbyrne would disagree. ICO's are illegal and that's the end of it. It's for your own good you're not allowed. Please buy stocks instead, where the value is extracted by VCs &accredited investors & major shareholders.
2115 2018-01-27 16:49:58 Quinton and Woakes are great multi utility and now there isn't anyone to be picked from among d Indian stocks to match their pedigree.

2117 2018-01-27 16:48:19 And yea Obama's policies were so bad that it got us out of a recession, got the economy booming ( which trump takes credit for), unemployment went down ( that trump takes credit), and stocks were soaring ( that trump takes credit for)

2121 2018-01-27 16:45:08 (1/2) When I talk about the companies I invest in, you’ll be able to rattle off hundreds of bad things about them—but that’s why they’re cheap! The most common comment I get is ‘Don’t you read the paper?’ Because if you read the paper, there’s no way you’d buy these stocks.

2123 2018-01-27 16:39:28 Once these hurdles are cleared for stocks like $AAO and $PKK then they will move. And it'll happen one day when you least expect it. Then IROC halts the damn thing and asks for a clarification news release and kills the momentum.
2124 2018-01-27 16:38:15 WRT penny stocks, all that matters is what big buyers & sellers think. Same thing is happening to me with $PKK stuck at 6 cents even with clear progress being made. Pinetree selling $AAO has nothing to the company, but new management wanting to liquidate Sheldon's old positions.

2126 2018-01-27 16:37:08 "By selling winning stocks too early, investors are willingly paying a fee (a "regret premium") to avoid feeling regret if the price falls."  But, by selling, one isn't  precluding feeling regret.  If the price continues to rise, regret will still come.
2127 2018-01-27 16:36:33 @RobinhoodApp you should be giving free stocks to people that downloaded and used your app like 2 years ago when it came out. New users are getting free stocks and I started using this in 2016 and never got anything. #salty

2135 2018-01-27 16:31:24 Tom, I love reading your stuff. I was watching a YouTube video with grantham talking about a melt-up, with stocks potentially moving much higher; and I wonder if your major maket top commentary, correction is simply a pause that refreshes? Trying to bridge the gap....thank you.
2136 2018-01-27 16:30:48 Asking people which tech companies they love in their personal life and picking those stocks works better than sweating over every analyst up, downgrade or fancy hedgefund idea.
2137 2018-01-27 16:30:34 My nausea became too much to bear when it took casino stocks 3 days to recover.
2138 2018-01-27 16:27:34 I tend to invest in high div stocks for my individual/roth/ira accounts and stick with target date through vanguard for SIMPLE.

2169 2018-01-27 16:09:10 I've been a garbage man to a Rock star. I've been from here to Europe and back. I don't know stocks but I know a good product when I see it. APP FDM BLO. From a medical app to a sports app..a sports app.. With chicks. I'm sorry, you're buying out because?..That's what I thought.
2170 2018-01-27 16:08:38 Unless you sell all of your stocks now, the “market wealth” is just numbers on paper. It’s for this reason that I should repeat, the stock market is not the economy. Also, the market went up 194% from when Obama came into office and when he left.
2171 2018-01-27 16:08:36 I'm told the public is still not involved. Check out the chart of TD / ETRADE retail trading of NYSE stocks as a %.  Absolutely parabolic in last number of months, highest by far since 2000 market top area.
2172 2018-01-27 16:08:16 Updating the watch list. A lot of stocks out there consolidating looking like they want a big move. Thats why we are here. We want to catch that move! Its all about being paitent
2173 2018-01-27 16:06:45 @YLindaQiu “richest 10 percent of households controlled 84 percent of the total value of stocks.” I can’t access study but it seems highly unlikely considering the large stockholdings of public and private pension plans and by foreigners. Are you misinterpreting the study?
2174 2018-01-27 16:05:08 This would be a good time to look into stocks on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. Don't just be a spectator while your friend's economy is rising. Join the eating!

2178 2018-01-27 16:01:41 Earning 7% by “holding stocks” is the same as being a property rentier... only markets of the future will be monetary/agricultural futures markets.
2179 2018-01-27 16:00:36 “dark pools”, a common term in stocks trading for liquidity that can be sourced outside of traditional exchanges, these pools became a way of ‘bypassing’ the public market when seeking liquidity. I think Ripple’s inventory might be similar solution for FI.

2185 2018-01-27 15:55:22 The only one I'm aware of is $IBB. The more cautious will always stick to ETFs, rather than individual stocks. I will add, health/bio is my least fave' sector, as few are ever profitable.
2186 2018-01-27 15:53:43 Obama admin, market goes up with no growth.  Why?  Artificially low interest rates causing people to pile into stocks to get a return.  Trump admin. Market goes up due to to measurable growth, and the expectation of additional growth (and profits).  Where'd this guy get his PHD?
2187 2018-01-27 15:53:40 2/  It exempts certain guns typically used for hunting or recreation, and would allow people to keep banned weapons they already have.
The bill also bans bump-fire stocks and other devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire at fully automatic rate
2188 2018-01-27 15:52:31 "issues that both parties say they agree on, from raising military spending to banning 'bump stocks,' which allow a semiautomatic weapon to fire like a machine gun, remain undone"
2189 2018-01-27 15:51:35 Like stocks, gold, real estate.......what a hatchet job @TheEconomist
2190 2018-01-27 15:50:10 Some stocks are like a Hendrix song

"I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run,
Tire tracks all across your back, uh-huh, I can see you had your fun.
But a darling, can't you see my signals turn from green to red
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead"
2191 2018-01-27 15:48:54 Thanks for the great interview. I was a chef years ago and make my own stocks regularly, but have never kept feet!  I’m so in this year!
2192 2018-01-27 15:47:48 #Bitcoin is not only a "currency" but also becoming a commodity. Super interesting to see how traders are going to integrate it into their migratory routes like stocks to bonds.

2195 2018-01-27 15:46:18 WHY MOST STILL NOT HAPPY? A large number of people missed the six-year bull market. More than half of Americans, 52 percent, are currently not investing in the stock market, either by buying individual stocks or mutual funds or through a retirement account such as 401(k) or IRA
2196 2018-01-27 15:44:45 How can trades be taken with 0 investment .... do u mean, pledge stocks' portfolio n use that margin for trades, leading to very small capital requirement.....or am I missing something?
2197 2018-01-27 15:44:07 False. I can't wait 30+ minutes to never speak with anyone, have emails ignored, and have agents hang up on me because I ask them to remain professional when they get out of line with me in an online chat. I'll just hire a financial advisor for stocks. Less stressful.
2198 2018-01-27 15:43:53 The pathology that has permeated the @GOP has gone beyond the pale. They need to be held accountable by US, the people! If they want to take US back to the 17th century, then let’s get out the stocks and the pikes! #GOT
2199 2018-01-27 15:42:57 Why do you think stocks go up.   The man making money off the poor.  Profits high for the man pockets dry for the poor.
2200 2018-01-27 15:41:30 Money? I hate to niggle but, they own vast amounts of volatile stock. Our notion of their wealth is a result of our use of the availability heuristic. Since we have not recently observed stocks collapse to zero value we don't factor in this very real possibility Precarious wealth
2201 2018-01-27 15:40:43 Hello everybody 
Please check your indicators after someone give nice stocks for next day. Best friendly to your indicators. I love all people as good well tips but I am still checking my own indicators first before I play. Many good feeders are positive not negative.
2202 2018-01-27 15:40:22 Unless it means buying back stocks to make investors happy.

2208 2018-01-27 15:36:07 The deal with increasing the AS is that every time it reduces the shareholder's value of their stock. Now you might argue AS is different from OS. However, for Pinks the two are synonymous, and more so for "Emerging growth stocks".

2214 2018-01-27 15:32:38 The SNB had no choice but to print money with the Euro racing the dollar to the bottom. They couldn't buy gold without raising its price, which would be unacceptable. US treasuries are a money losing proposition with the dollar tanking. US stocks are really the only choice.

He figures he can pay them off, cut regs, cut taxes on them, etc. Keep the stocks booming, he figures, and he has a shot to survive. He doesn't like you, he's embarrassed you exist. You got taken.

the recent Cannmart announcement means Health Canada licensing approval is at hand once the facility is constructed. The stock has been a big winner and may be running a little ahead of prospects. I would maintain existing positions.

2233 2018-01-27 15:22:11 I tend to stay away from stocks with very high yields. Most often it is not sustainable. I try to buy a mix of lower growth higher yield stocks with higher growth lower yield stocks. Does that answer your question? It may require a longer note than a twitter response

2334 2018-01-27 14:08:40 He’s so full of crap. Most in the Resistance can’t afford stocks. No clue of the grass roots levels. For the love of God, Mueller a few bread crumbs right about now would be comforting.
2335 2018-01-27 14:08:33 How come I don't notice anything! Only th wealthy benefit there! I can afford stocks!!!
2336 2018-01-27 14:07:20 Exactly, the majority of Americans cant afford to invest in stocks bc the economy has not gone up for us, it has gone up for the rich only.  Average American economy has remained stand still or worse in some cases.
2337 2018-01-27 14:06:41 Stop bro you killing draft stocks 
2338 2018-01-27 14:06:39 My top driver of this run up in stocks: 
 A stock shortage compounded by increased demand for equities from numerous types of asset managers. This will be compounded further with companies increasing 401K matches.
2339 2018-01-27 14:06:24 Corporations are buying back their stocks. Thousands of people have lost there jobs over the tax cuts. Even with DACA. What ever goes around comes around. As you sow, You shall reap. You will get old one day.
2340 2018-01-27 14:05:48 Just wondering if Corporate donors  who have benefited by thriving stocks & decide to boycott the circus?
2341 2018-01-27 14:04:29 But read somewhere it's about the stocks etc., they're not revealing anything to the papers with certainty. Also Auba has this court case hearing on Monday. So if it isn't clear by Tuesday, then there's a problem.
2342 2018-01-27 14:04:29 @Ptuchmannyse You have the gift to prognosticate stocks that would make most money in quickest time. A champion of the markets!

2349 2018-01-27 14:00:05 Sir, as per ur marketing ur style is QGLP so do u mean to say that whatever has gone up in last one year is not QGLP and only contra/deep value/high beta is,thats where the disagreement is,imho QGLP stocks are doing pretty fine in this market, maybe not the ones u have 
2350 2018-01-27 13:59:55 If a token is like a stock / security: there are hundreds of different retail stocks, hundreds of restaurant stocks. There are different classes of securities: there are preferred shares, bonds, coupons, exchange traded funds (ETF), etc.

It's only natural.
2351 2018-01-27 13:59:45 @chrisbrecher will tell you that the best stocks to short in a correction are ones that "already look bad" vs. those that held up well to begin with.
2352 2018-01-27 13:59:21 Robinhood already has over 300 Billion in assets under management.  When their users get instance access to these coins there will be billions moved from stocks to crypto.  I suspect the new crowd will buy up the cheapest coins first.  It's going to be huge!

2354 2018-01-27 13:58:45 the bull market is being driven by low interest rates, Not trump...when low interest rates produce very little return, the demand for stocks increases
2355 2018-01-27 13:58:35 To believe in the company ask yourself.  1- why no inside buying  stocks?2-Where are all the great investors  that do not see the big opportunity? If you have company that you know that soon you fly, end you can buy 25% stocks with 1 billion! Why FPC don't buying back stocks?
2356 2018-01-27 13:58:24 I’m not worried about the Auba deal anymore from what I’ve seen from the media reports I think if you piece it together the court case and BVB stocks have something to do with all of this. Deadline day.

2363 2018-01-27 13:55:25 After pocketing a $5 billion tax cut from the GOP Tax Scam, Pfizer decided to end all of its Alzheimer's and Parkinson's research. Then they did exactly as it was predicted, they fired 300 scientists and used that money to buy back their stocks.
2364 2018-01-27 13:55:06 Every now & then the City Police (some of whom may have also been patrons) would "raid" the bootleggers to make it look like the City was doing something. I expect the 'leggers were tipped off in advance to keep their stocks low to minimize the "damage".

2368 2018-01-27 13:52:12 Market went up on Institutional buying 30% + before tax cuts. Study Max Keiser research on this. Average Joe not buying new stocks but speculating in real estate now. Bubbles are all set in place. Idol worship of Trump will only bring doom. Buy physical Silver to survive.

2372 2018-01-27 13:45:21 Seems to happen all thru markets, they even rigged LIBOR, penny stocks forever, commodities supply/demand controlled by storing/releasing after futures rigged. All derivatives,options,etc should be stopped, it's all criminal imo. Back to investing would return confidence

2392 2018-01-27 13:31:44 Weak dollar artificially props up stocks and hard assets like commodities. Since these assets are largely owned by the rich,  incentive to keep this trend intact until they have rung the register. Dollar will then get stronger once they have moved to cash/ bonds #bananarepublic
2393 2018-01-27 13:29:20 Stocks are reliably chaotic. The problem is the investors who expect otherwise.
2394 2018-01-27 13:28:43 I finally make enough to actually invest in stocks. And all my investment ideas from 3 years ago (that did work) can't work now...
2395 2018-01-27 13:27:34 This is not a surprise when they did not pass a ill on banning bump stocks. Each and everyone should be voted out. They are there to represent party and obviously not for the people.

2411 2018-01-27 13:15:01 funny how trump only wants to take credit for what he believes is positive. like the stock market. if these closures aren't a mark against him because they were in the works before, he can't take credit for the stocks either.

2416 2018-01-27 13:12:11 One thing that really help me was staying away from stocks that weren't green on the monthly. Red on monthly = no trades. Trying to fight gravity was suicide to an account unless short.

2426 2018-01-27 13:02:03 Hey pal, this could go on forever. if you genuinely disagree that Trump has not been effective in creating market wealth, I assume you sold stocks after election day? And that you're happy you did.
2427 2018-01-27 13:00:47 1st two penny stocks  I’ve ever done were a success.  $frlf for $128 profit and in at .36 for $potn.  Having a hard time selling this one though.

2430 2018-01-27 12:58:19 Thanks for following. Not just those pinned on my profile. Typically I choose to focus on about 10 stocks. And I update that watchlist regularly.
2431 2018-01-27 12:57:40 To @theprospect “White people — blinded by racism — still suffer under Trump” Of course! They’re overtaxed underemployed undersavings & if own stocks will soon lose 70% as Oligarchs sell! Fix: Vote 4 @OurRevolution @SenSanders @AP_Politics @AFLCIO @_richardpainter @maddow @CBS
2432 2018-01-27 12:56:18 Flows create stocks 
2433 2018-01-27 12:55:44 I can make a strong valuation case for stocks based on economic growth and tax reform ... that said, passive money is driving the run ups and that’s only gonna get stronger
2434 2018-01-27 12:54:19 @katiecannon2 your equation includes both flows and stocks  (typos?)
2435 2018-01-27 12:54:11 Just to add something else in the tax we all pay doesn’t really pay for public services or infrastructure it’s there to keep inflation down loosely. The Bank of England ie government bailed the banks out this all stayed in stocks and shares which the very rich make their fortune
2436 2018-01-27 12:52:48 Sure, the stock market only helps those who trade and buy stocks. How many base trumpers play the market? Why don’t you look at the dollar, all time low against 10 world leading economies, not a good sign. Keep shucking the chum Doris.
2437 2018-01-27 12:51:18 De la misma manera, el Estado podría intentar poner suelos y tejados al mercado de compra y alquiler utilitzando "buffer stocks" de viviendas (siempre puedes ir de alquiler por debajo de un precio, o alquilar al estado para hace run beneficio mínimo).
2438 2018-01-27 12:47:42 Just remember. Stocks are like sports gambling. No one brags about their losses.

2459 2018-01-27 12:18:20 Not sure how 2 explain this any clearer...but if some1 barely makes enough 2 live on they can't invest in stock market because they have no money 2 do so. The majority of US citizens do not own stocks so therefore they do not benefit from rising stock prices.
2460 2018-01-27 12:16:55 The DJIA was at 381 before it crashed in 1929. We are way above that number. Therefore, stocks must be a bubble.

These are named derivatives.
Derivatives because their value depends on the underlying item.

2473 2018-01-27 11:55:29 This is absolutely not true in stocks though. People buy stocks because they like looking at the charts imo.
2474 2018-01-27 11:54:52 I wonder, what it would take for economists to generally acknowledge an asset bubble and/or a mania?  #economics has used the last 50 years (or so) on rationalizing asset bubbles, and where has that led us? #stocks #bonds
2475 2018-01-27 11:54:16 Lately, Pharma stocks bounced back from 52 wk lows & participated in the rally but nothing exciting seen in Q3 Nos of Ajanta & DrReddys. US generic biz continue to see pricing pressure. Recent Approvals & Regulatory clearances will take time to reflect in Financials (1.5-2 yrs)

2488 2018-01-27 11:29:59 Yes there is a spike in the Dow, however if your in stocks, that is a long term investment, depending on his economic decisions over the next few years, and outside factors, that can change.

2502 2018-01-27 11:16:23 Stocks may not be cheap but they are still far more attractive than many other asset classes. Arguably we still have not seen the individual investor embrace this market in a big way. Everyone wants to call the end to this party. Enjoy the ride!  Greg Newman

2536 2018-01-27 10:39:09 Erm... that’d make sense, if it weren’t for everything in the UK from property to goods to services to stocks and shares being horribly overvalued. Invest in Moldova and DPR Congo if that’s the philosophy.

2595 2018-01-27 09:25:28 He isn't an entrepreneur though. The real successful people get big off of something new that they create, not the people who buy and sell stocks or sell stuff online. So keep on creating until you make something that blows up.
2596 2018-01-27 09:23:36 Why is it that there is so little volume on recent breakouts with other strong stocks too (SHOP, WB, GRUB)? Just a trick to attract buyers maybe? Should we consider this a warning? Thank you :)

going naked on puts is actually a gud strategy if done on gud stocks and within ur auks (aukaad)
2614 2018-01-27 08:50:38 Yes, you asked any good option seller will agree and never advice to sell naked. Do in form of strategies and you should have very dynamic mind to move when tide turns against you. Specially in stocks where sigma event is more often than index
2615 2018-01-27 08:48:07 Everything that I see from here tells me that Nigeria's FG merely HOPE to secure diplomatic stocks from this unconscionable, cutthroat deal which is concurrently demeaning cos it does not even facilitate skills acquisition by local maintenance crews

2632 2018-01-27 08:26:06 Yes, actually it is good the average and poor. When stocks start to drop companies look for ways to cut on a much larger scale. And that will start at the bottom and works it's way up.

2744 2018-01-27 05:58:07 That very well could be Wynn selling his own stocks.

2753 2018-01-27 05:45:45 Yup, it’s amazing. Invest big amounts in income producing assets... businesses, stocks & real estate. Small amounts in gold/silver, cash, tiny amount in speculative assets with big potential, like crypto or high-risk stocks like small biotechs, miners, & turnaround plays. #invest

2762 2018-01-27 05:31:08 True. The beauty of crypto is that a coin doesn’t have to do much to keep appreciating. It’s so unlike stocks. If a company loses revenue over the long term then the stock is dead. But with crypto less new fiat can come in but as long as holders don’t liquidate the value can rise

2812 2018-01-27 04:41:43 One way to dump trump is progressives dump all stocks and tank the markets - dreamers key so cough up the 25 b for the dumb wall - lots of jobs created when dems take control and we tear it down
2813 2018-01-27 04:41:28 Jaylen seems like an anomaly in a lot of ways. Randle's lowish stocks with the physical limitations were still a red flag even if he got over the min threshold. I'm prob a Swanigan skeptic.

2913 2018-01-27 03:00:13 It's been said that the next Mark Zuckerburg won't create a social media platform. The next Bill Gates won't create an operating system. The next Warren Buffet won't invest in blue chip stocks. Why do we try to replicate what they did instead of replicating the principal?

2920 2018-01-27 02:53:04 In Stock Market Wizards one guy said he felt super guilty his pappy was toiling on farm in hot sun while he messed around with stocks. Doesnt bother me. I once had a job at a bookstore where I had to take out the garbage.
2921 2018-01-27 02:52:17 May i join your group? For stocks and crypto mentoring. Thanks
2922 2018-01-27 02:52:06 I believe TA works in the stock market but is not as effective in crypto. There is no fundamental value in crypto when compared to stocks. Why are you so hostile?

2955 2018-01-27 02:18:24 i used to have conversations w/ppl when discussing siegel/etc 'stocks for long run' that logical thing to do is to have equities represent more than 100% of portfolio and never look at it. ignoring practical capital depletion for retirement, of course, but that's the idea.
2956 2018-01-27 02:18:17 What if the new bitcoin futures market is going to make 2018 a flat year for cryptocurrencies while precious metals and stocks outperform?
2957 2018-01-27 02:17:34 Everybody talking about stocks goings up. Holla at me when gas goes down or the price of something that affects me changes
2958 2018-01-27 02:16:00 Um, stocks change hands all the time at different prices. Once the company issues shares, they don’t care.
2959 2018-01-27 02:14:21 3/ @PolymathNetwork working with #tZero working on ERC20 like solution for securities. 1H 2020, I say we will have stocks on blockchain, and derivatives to follow.
2960 2018-01-27 02:14:15 idiot...if it's all so good, please enlighten everyone as to what has helped you in any way.

what did you get a $42 increase for less taxes? Stocks have been rising since 2009.

Enlighten me
2961 2018-01-27 02:14:11 Idiot.y stocks ate up 25 percent.
2962 2018-01-27 02:13:40 @seanhannity  All fake news networks, newspapers donate all of their personal earnings from 401k, stocks, etc. to RNC.
2963 2018-01-27 02:12:04 ウケたw
2964 2018-01-27 02:10:53 Sure, via profit. Made through contributing to the economy via stocks in a company. That does not mean they’re having their money sit in a bank doing nothing.
2965 2018-01-27 02:10:44 2/ #tZero is next logical step in this Crypto story, to have stocks on blockchain, CEO has epic story about investors short his stock. One of the big one is now long $OSTK. What an irony.

2968 2018-01-27 02:09:17 When Forecasting $DAX and other indices & stocks, use statistics to guide you..

Assuming 70% WIN% ~ you are getting 30% loses
STUDENT T Dist prob tables show around 8 to 10 consecutive loses are average.

Can your Bank withstand 8 loses in a row? 
Hardly = RUIN PROB high..
2969 2018-01-27 02:08:00 @SupportNRAILA @NRAILA Where is your support for those under attack in Mass. Why haven’t you come to our defense on bump stocks?
2970 2018-01-27 02:07:42 Infinite? Think of it this way. If your wealth is $50,000, how much would you allocate to cash, stocks, real estate, etc.
2971 2018-01-27 02:05:46 The biggest issue I am observing with crypto, and getting the world onboard with it, is that it is complicated and difficult to understand.  Stocks are easy...if you like Coca-Cola, buy their stock...if you like Apple, buy their stock.  People are familiar with these. #crypto
2972 2018-01-27 02:05:39 I honestly hope that is true... Hopefully the tax cuts will be the catalyst... But stocks have been this overbought before and rallied another 100+ percent... And we also have circuit breakers in place to protect against mass panic selling... A correction would be healthy
2973 2018-01-27 02:05:28 @scottevest Scott Jordan probably owns a fortune in ScotteVest stocks.  As usual, we're winning, don't stop the boycott.  Why purchase anything from a company that will make a moron like this guy rich?  RETWEET!!!
2974 2018-01-27 02:05:20 Working at the bank made me realize that the real money is in stocks. Learn stocks and you’re retired in no time

2977 2018-01-27 02:04:21 @tonyhawk My three boys only wear Tony Hawk shorts and shirts, and I’m dying that Kohls no longer stocks your clothes. Is the clothing line being discontinued?? Please tell me it’s just going to another chain, and if it is, where?!

Rich people spend money too.
2983 2018-01-27 02:00:08 National banks investing in risky assets like stocks?  NOTHING NEW THERE....Norway...Japan...etc. THE PROBLEM is when a government invests in risky assets like stocks AND prints money....do u see the conflict?

2987 2018-01-27 01:55:44 Just take a look at the #s of the DOW and all the other stocks.. Eh? Not that hard... Look at unemployment rates. Look at statistics instead of listening to the media.

2990 2018-01-27 01:53:46 Go pro?  He can’t hit a 12 foot jump shot. He’s not playing in the nba without a jumper.
2991 2018-01-27 01:53:28 ok now wait i've thought some more -- if your stocks went up from 0.01 to 0.02, wouldn't they be an attractive thing for buyers, like "hey these stocks are on the rise, buy them while u can"??
2992 2018-01-27 01:52:40 You think going to go up forever? The stock market was ready for a correction over a year ago.  The only thing really pushing up stocks is tech (AI, IOT, Self driving cars, etc.). Stuff that was going to happen no matter who won the White House. How's that for a childish reply?
2993 2018-01-27 01:52:02 @realDonaldTrump ARCH COAL BEGGED Americans and Veterans to buy their stocks. They stole everyone’s money and erased their stocks, forcing Veterans to loose MILLIONS. However they paid their EXC MILLIONs in Bonuses, 3 days before filing BK.
2994 2018-01-27 01:51:41 @shaffnerronda thanks for adding me and good luck on your penny stocks!!

2999 2018-01-27 01:44:45 Shhhhhh!  It's going to bust soon..so the Corporation can buy back their stocks...it's timed right after the Indictments. Allow the Trumpettes to go broke!
3000 2018-01-27 01:43:15 With a legal backround surely you would be better suited to a more pressing and important use for blockchain technology sheree! Bitcar... i mean come on. There are real issues to be fixed with this tech and you guys are playing swapsie stocks with exotic vehicles :/ so backwards.
3001 2018-01-27 01:42:21 Why would it matter if it did crash? Virtually every relevant exchange has crashed in the last couple of months. That comes w/ the #crypto territory when millions want in. Also, @RobinhoodApp had millions lined up ahead of time to buy stocks so they wouldn’t crash. They’re legit.
3002 2018-01-27 01:38:56 The Republican Party seem to be involved in criminal activities their self by protecting Trump baby inside Trading inside trading that's why the stocks are going up all I get is a filthy rich For the Love of Money
3003 2018-01-27 01:37:52 There you go. Get your immigrants, higher taxes, less jobs, poor stocks, great idea. #MAGA
3004 2018-01-27 01:37:28 No trading or deposit/withdrawal feels for stocks.  My guess There will still be a few for the crypto transfer depending on cost so like 9 cents for LTC or ~$20 for BTC but no user fee like coinbase has
3005 2018-01-27 01:36:40 Obama started the economy the way it was got unemployment rates down and stocks went from 5000 to 19000 when all was said in his last year so trump did squat. And what about all companies laying off thats not booming stop listening to trumps lies
3006 2018-01-27 01:36:22 I believe the contrary, that it will take up the skilled labour. Accountancy, finance, stocks etc.. Would love to see AI lay bricks..

3009 2018-01-27 01:31:45 Just because you don't like the truth doesn't mean it isn't the truth. I have no idea about your personal stocks, but the stock market is growing slower than it was before he took office.
3010 2018-01-27 01:31:30 So riddle us neophytes on your definition of “economic health” and explain why  $ increases  in funds and stocks in 401ks are not included. Thanks ahead of time
3011 2018-01-27 01:31:12 You are picking Hardik pandya in place of Ben stocks..  Seriously bro
3012 2018-01-27 01:30:56 True. Next few months should be interesting. I bet the day C45 passes senate, all the cannabis stocks will be on fire . So many catalysts like govt MOU, retail chains, licenses on there way !! #excited . Whole diff story if Senate delays or rejects C45 
3013 2018-01-27 01:29:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
3014 2018-01-27 01:28:37 I need to learn how to trade stocks!
3015 2018-01-27 01:28:21 今日レポート終わらなかったら死ぬ
3016 2018-01-27 01:26:54 I'm referring to existing stocks that are doing financing, not stocks yet to IPO.
3017 2018-01-27 01:26:45 Agreed 100%. I trade stocks on them. I use another site/app for tech analysis but buy with Robinhood. Hope it’ll help bust out some $trx manipulators
3018 2018-01-27 01:24:51 I’ve tweeted about the absurd valuations given marijuana stocks many times , Andrew.  Your turn to hear from the marijuana cheerleader wackos.

3020 2018-01-27 01:24:18 Why be in a hurry to hurt one of their stocks. For one good fight?  This champ vs champ is a bit out of control.
3021 2018-01-27 01:23:29 If you play traditional stocks, I wouldn't think $MGTI is a bad pick right now. Been in a downtrend, but after cutting ties with Jmac, they might have a chance to get re-listed on NASDAQ. Also one of the few debt-free stocks trading on the pink sheets.
3022 2018-01-27 01:22:55 Just fried chicken flavor essentially?

Looking out for that Motley Fool party stocks report
3023 2018-01-27 01:22:53 They are not a smart basketball team. These mistakes is not because of youth.....it’s talent and IQ.
3024 2018-01-27 01:21:18 The Democrats don't want hard working Americans to keep their money. Look at all the raises, bonuses,  and in some cases stocks the company's are giving employees because of the new tax law. The dems want your money. Think before you vote.
3025 2018-01-27 01:21:10 Pay attention to your inter self  If you get: 

goosebumps.. heart starts racing. fulfillment. Joy. happiness. You can’t stop thinking about that one thing you enjoy!

3031 2018-01-27 01:11:58 After pocketing a $5 billion tax cut from the GOP Tax Scam, Pfizer decided to end all of its Alzheimer's and Parkinson's research. Then they did exactly as it was predicted, they fired 300 scientists and used that money to buy back their stocks. Quite the response, Mimi.
3032 2018-01-27 01:11:58 You don’t remember your own Fake News? In 2016, CNN reported “If Donald Trump wins the election, U.S. stocks (and likely many other markets overseas) will almost certainly tank.” Based on CNN’s own comments from over a year ago, 150% of the rally Credit goes to Trump.
3033 2018-01-27 01:10:16 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
3034 2018-01-27 01:09:11 So more $ in your check, more $ in your stocks, more women and minorities working & making more $, more companies moving production back to the US which means more jobs, etc.  

As for compassion, your generation sucked that out of mine. 
3035 2018-01-27 01:08:52 you cant find any gpu anywhere on the shelves

3036 2018-01-27 01:08:26 My dad asked me to tell him all that I know about buying stocks so he can start investing money. I feel so smart. Lol

3038 2018-01-27 01:03:50 Well, mine are part of my retirement plan. I don't own stocks but my 401 looks great.
3039 2018-01-27 01:01:13 Or how about you stop babbling like a moron and pretending a few talking points excuse a con man traitor from violating the Constitution and betraying the nation? Yes? Thanks. Half the people in this country don't have stocks/bonds and aren't benefiting from the tax scam.

3042 2018-01-27 00:59:31 If the davos meeting people are Investing in USA, it's a good sign that you should too. Buy 401k or invest in stocks. Trump just let everyone know how to make money if you did not pick up on that.
3043 2018-01-27 00:57:27 And how does 401ks doing better and stocks doing better not affect or show positive out comes from the policies and changes being made he has really just showing that he doesn't care about what people think of him he cares about how the country is doing and moving forward
3044 2018-01-27 00:57:20 There are no Commission fees for stocks and dont believe there are going to be any for Crypto
3045 2018-01-27 00:57:13 A "reflexividade" de Soros é Kant aplicado às finanças e atualizado pela ciência comportamental do século XX e XXI. Foco no sujeito (investidor/especulador) e não no objeto (stocks/moedas/bonds).
3046 2018-01-27 00:56:21 You do know you can buy bump stocks in another state.

3050 2018-01-27 00:53:39 I am guessing you did not have stocks, 401k, or the company you work for did not give you a bonus. I guess you will have to wait for your tax return if you were working......

3056 2018-01-27 00:48:14 it seems reasonable to me at least, but then again i am no stock market wizard so maybe there's something about penny stocks that prevent that??? idk??
3057 2018-01-27 00:47:44 Hanging out with my dad- he walks in and says "Not to talk about stocks, but.." And then talks about stocks.
3058 2018-01-27 00:46:45  ok so then.... why not invest heavily in very very cheap stocks since a few cents change would be a massive percentage change for them compared with a very expensive stock that would need a much larger amount of money to increase the same percentage?
3059 2018-01-27 00:46:17 Guess you better not ever invest in stocks either! You degenerate gambler!
3060 2018-01-27 00:45:51 What imma go ghost like ye n start a clothing line, be on them stocks, n other businesses on they ass
3061 2018-01-27 00:44:09 It’s an app you can use to invest in stocks, but like, super simple and you don’t need more than 5 bucks
3062 2018-01-27 00:43:36 Have you actually done any research into bump stocks? You going to ban fingers, rubber bands and 3d printers next? It's not rocket science to bump fire a a weapon. There are literally videos of people using just a finger, a rubber band, and 3d print plans.
3063 2018-01-27 00:43:03 I wonder if there will be fees to transfer out of RH...is there with stocks?
3064 2018-01-27 00:42:24 We DO have stocks and multiple investment portfolios. We just choose to NOT let personal greed override our loyalty to this country, and to our fellow citizens. Our faith tries to follow the word of Christ, not one that ignores His teachings in favor of hate, bigotry, and greed.
3065 2018-01-27 00:42:13 when your brother is a business major, you bond by investing in stocks
3066 2018-01-27 00:40:51 Robinhood got crypto currency stocks coming in February. That news really made my day
3067 2018-01-27 00:39:42 Ok what if there is a stock that is 1 penny and you buy 1,000,000 stocks, if the price goes up to 2 pennies wouldn't you have basically made $10,000 just from the price increasing 1 penny each?? Cuz the value doubles?
3068 2018-01-27 00:38:24 Lying Media has 90% negative coverage of President Trump, but...

Four qtrs of 3+% growth.
Stocks are at Record Highs.
Unemployment for minorities at record lows.
Passed budget, 1st year.
Jerusalem is Capital of Isreal.
ISIS on the run.

Plus more, but lying media won't admit it.
3069 2018-01-27 00:37:41 There was a decent sell off in the US stock market after Brexit on that Friday and Monday. I bought 3 stocks at the end of the day Friday, I didn’t even time it right (free advice: you can’t).

Those 3 stocks, as of close today, are up a combined 399.78%. #buyandhold
3070 2018-01-27 00:37:40 Yeah since no one is buying their $7 swill anymore, stores are underperforming, stocks down. Someone said add Blockchain!!!!
3071 2018-01-27 00:37:01 Hey, if anyone hates Trump so much and does not want the extra earnings from the Trump admin. This year (retirement, stocks, bonuses, raises), please give it to me. I will take the money for the sake of your hate and you will feel a lot better, I guarantee you.

Analysts at Royal London Asset Management said the state of Brexit negotiations had probably had little influence over recent moves …

Client is up 40% the last 2 years. Wanted to sell all stocks in Jan ‘16 which we talked them out of. Haven’t taken any recommendations to rebalance last 12-18 months. Constantly grating us about “underperformance”.

3077 2018-01-27 00:34:42 #Bailouts If the bailouts had gone to individuals everyone in America could be millionaires. Many would have bought new cars saving the auto industry.

3078 2018-01-27 00:33:56 Stocks work one feels instead of reals. 
This IS LITTERALLY an example of damage control. Intel probably paid them off so the stock will bounce back.
3079 2018-01-27 00:31:33 Crash is coming bud.  Look at Trump’s business history.  Boom then bust.  But by all means, buy some stocks now!
3080 2018-01-27 00:31:30 Y'all gave Obama 8 years. And look what he did to our country. You tell me one thing Trump did to deserve the treatment you all are given him. Stocks are up. Unemployment is at an all time low. You and Schumer are doing nothing but causing division. You and Schumer are possessed.
3081 2018-01-27 00:30:39 I tried Trading some alt coins on #Binance. $btc. I feel like they are mostly pump and dump.The only strategy is buy and hold. Stocks futures are better. 5% move with leverage can yield 40% 1day. Crypto pop 40% then do nothing for 40days. No skill imo
3082 2018-01-27 00:28:30 @realDonaldTrump Thank you Mr President!!! More $ in our paychecks and more money in stocks!!!
Now We can get things fixed in the house and start buying again!

Anyhow that's likes buying stocks on credit.  Just really silly actually.
3086 2018-01-27 00:24:18 Unfortunately the Dollar's tanking. Because most Americans' DOLLARS will buy their food / shelter / clothing. Not stocks / bonds / retirement plans.

3091 2018-01-27 00:22:50 Interesting close to the week.  Was in the green for all stocks with just one red $BTL, and one flat liner $FAT.  Was anticipating a red day for marijuana stocks so was pleasantly surprised.  $NF was my winner today with a 20% increase.
3092 2018-01-27 00:21:29 Ok I’m back in TWTR and SCHD. Of course I’m going long. Remember to keep your portfolio diverse. Just because I talk tech doesn’t mean I’m not in t-bills a few bonds and ETF’s. Just Incase stocks get hit I can pull from my backbone. @CNBCtech @CNBC @CharlesSchwab @Twitter

3094 2018-01-27 00:19:25 Great moves on stocks always look so easy after the fact but truth is many miss out on them because of panicking on short term 5 min charts!
3095 2018-01-27 00:19:23 Bah bien sûr 
Quel est le but ? 
Le client est contente et le magasin écoulé ses stocks sans faire de gâchis et prend un peu d'argent
3096 2018-01-27 00:19:08 Stocks are overvalued until the earnings reports come in... The rally this year has been fueled by fear of missing out more so than fundamentals of the company... Any bad news report could send a stock tumbling... Look at Facebook... They lost 10 bucks overnight about 10 days ago
3097 2018-01-27 00:18:35 How much are my commodity stocks gonna get smoked?
3098 2018-01-27 00:17:21 You are right Dianne; nothing has changed except we now have tax cuts, stocks soaring, GDP headed to 4%, Americans have more money in their pockets no thanks to ANY DEMS including you.  Those are the things the average American cares about.  #MAGA

3101 2018-01-27 00:14:27 US stocks are just begging for a big fat correction tho. line has gone near vertical.
3102 2018-01-27 00:13:31 @djhifi @AlexStark almost never on these sub $5 stocks really depends on the company that's upgrading to.. like a JPMorgan or Goldman
3103 2018-01-27 00:12:30 Wait! Banks are buying their stocks back, which creates less liquidity, which then increase value, which then increases 401k, IRA etc, then
The middle class gets bonuses, and higher wages, which then gives them more money to set asside into 401k, IRA etc, sounds bad to me.

3113 2018-01-27 00:04:54 Stocks up today nicely
3114 2018-01-27 00:04:43 No savings. No 401(k). No pension. No stocks. No bonds. No gold bars. Maybe a jar of coins for a bad week when you need gas in your car, food for family or pay your bills.
3115 2018-01-27 00:02:48 I’ve always said whether betting teams, picking stocks or picking DFS players-give me your reason-your logic was sound-it didn’t work out-don’t sweat it bro
3116 2018-01-27 00:02:18 Overplayed his hand, thought he could do better when his stocks were high and eventually when he decided he wanted to leave CD, those offers were of the table. Does not mean they will not happen in the future. He is a good offensive center and things change quickly in Euroball.
3117 2018-01-27 00:01:57 I am a single income mother, my taxes went up $200 per month, my health insurance went up $200 a month, the deductible went from $600 Family to $4000 per person....under Obama. Your stocks went up . Sounds like Obama helped the rich - stole from the poor. Thanks

3119 2018-01-27 00:01:14 J'avais même aménagé une cave avec des rayonnages et on avait une sorte de mini-supermarché "à domicile" avec tout ce qu'on avait besoin au quotidien et on renouvelait les stocks au fur et à mesure des consommations.
3120 2018-01-27 00:00:47 How many times a day do you check your stocks?
3121 2018-01-27 00:00:42 love how every hotel stocks the rooms with one satchel of normal nescafe, and then four packs of decaf because no one ever drinks those
3122 2018-01-27 00:00:00 It's great to make money in the markets. However, times like these, where there is so much euphoria causes me to pause and revisit my entire investment portfolio. It's time to be mindful of the possibility of a correction in the horizon. #StockMarket #stocks #investing #Investor
3123 2018-01-26 23:59:26 Seriously?!! @sccstreetsahead @Ameyplc @SheffCouncil Poisoned tea?! Have you not a scrap of dignity left? What absolute laughing stocks you’re making of yourselves. #SaveSheffTrees #STAG #PFIScandal
3124 2018-01-26 23:58:24 But the VIX! I’m holding some biotech stocks that regularly move 5-8% in a day and sometimes 15%. Both ways. I just shrug it off. Usually no news at all. Thin vol, twitchy traders.
3125 2018-01-26 23:55:18 what haunts me is the idea that everything reverse in unison. US stocks. our stocks. our economy. house prices. Maybe with a China trigger so China's plummeting too. will be tough to pull out of.
3126 2018-01-26 23:55:03 So, not the racism. Not the incompetence. Not the sexual assaults. Not violating the emollients clause. Not making us laughing stocks to the rest of the world. But THIS is too much? Well give them an f'n parade.

3138 2018-01-26 23:45:10 Next year do the NBA All Star Draft right. Full on show. I want a podium and a commissioner. I want a green room for players.

3163 2018-01-26 23:41:10 FTFY: With Bitcoin getting smacked by almost 50%, he had to chase the stocks.
3164 2018-01-26 23:38:33 too bad you sold all your Stocks Because you listen to fake news
3165 2018-01-26 23:37:44 @AskRobinhood Will the new cryptocurrency capability allow users to trade partial amounts? Currently regular stocks have to be traded in while amounts. Will that be the case for Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc?
3166 2018-01-26 23:37:19 @moneysnoteverything I don't trade casino stocks.
3167 2018-01-26 23:36:39 Who do I know that is an active swing trader? Stocks. Not crypto. Starting my journey and looking to see who else is out there
3168 2018-01-26 23:36:31 Better hurry and make that money on the stocks,  it's going to crash!

3173 2018-01-26 23:32:45 So I just bought some stocks in @sprint
3174 2018-01-26 23:32:38 Do you still do daily stocks notes and picks those day sir ?
3175 2018-01-26 23:32:30 I hit my 80 hours today, my stocks went up and there storms coming in. This is the best day of my life.
3176 2018-01-26 23:32:11 Buy pot stocks. Make money off these stoners
3177 2018-01-26 23:31:22 Have a blast ! If your as good at counting cards as picking stocks you can end up owning WYNN .
3178 2018-01-26 23:31:11 I have a secret trading method to make money off stocks that works as well as every other trading method does in a rising market.
3179 2018-01-26 23:30:08 haha maybe is a terrible company but there was huge money to be made buying the breakout on the otc weed stocks.. just dont fall in love and lock in profits.  easiest money ive made so far
3180 2018-01-26 23:29:49 Quite possibly the dumbest person twitter. Stocks up 300% under obama. But he didn't take credit
3181 2018-01-26 23:29:12 Not enough money for food? Invest in stocks. You get free steak dinners at the shareholder's meetings.
3182 2018-01-26 23:28:38 USA lost 93,000 jobs last year. Stop trying to work and buy stocks and bonds instead.
3183 2018-01-26 23:27:46 Fang stocks: next week $FB, $GOOG $APPL and $AMZN all report. It will be a wild week especially if they don’t kick it out of the park and guide higher. Enjoying the run till it lasts. Bull run for 9 years and it is stronger than ever.
3184 2018-01-26 23:26:57 Ils sont épuisés chez l'éditeur et dans nos stocks. Coup de fil au diffuseur lundi au cas où.

3186 2018-01-26 23:25:24 Rotate into what? Cash or crypto? Stocks is the rotation. Everyone is rotating out of bond. Cash is paying 1.55%. Usd is free falling. Rotate into tips or gold/silver?
3187 2018-01-26 23:24:42 1-2MMbl excess production for 2 years - should have 800MMbl+ stocks Adding: Oil on water +OCED +China +KSA +Other OPEC. Inventories are lower than they were in 2014. 900MMbl vanished!! DEMAND, 1/2 of the equation. Crude will be $10 higher in 3-4 weeks.
3188 2018-01-26 23:24:02 Finally about to start investing in stocks 
3189 2018-01-26 23:22:33 Labor is an expense to be minimized or eliminated to increase profits for the owners. So instead of working, buy stocks and bonds.
3190 2018-01-26 23:22:09 $FB Kramer bashed this don’t all the other fang stocks window open for stock selling from insiders also why did he say that about Fb?
3191 2018-01-26 23:21:40 Zack, I doubt you are old enough to have been an adult when the last Stock Market Balloon popped. Guess what! All of the regulations he has relaxed of eliminated were put in place to keep from having another bubble. The stocks are being overpriced AGAIN! Another recession looming
3192 2018-01-26 23:21:30 She's checking her stocks to make sure she doesn't throw the enemy through a company building she has shares in.
3193 2018-01-26 23:21:24 Any stocks we should keep an eye out for?
3194 2018-01-26 23:21:19 Has any of the haters noticed the stocks have been up since he took office?!  I guess not. @realDonaldTrump
3195 2018-01-26 23:20:03 The team awesome calls. working relationships so ons. haven't release my 20k soons brothers. Watings an then its ons. Money longs.
3196 2018-01-26 23:19:50 The gradual stocks are always the best ones and tend to hold onto their gains like your VLE TOT ANP etc of this world
3197 2018-01-26 23:19:44 he looks musty.
3198 2018-01-26 23:19:10 Ikr! When a friend of mine and me tried to go into the stocks i was so confused on how to find info on the project. Cant speak to the head guys, cant ask the community opinion and i even had problems to visualize simple stuff like mcap distributions and roadmap.
3199 2018-01-26 23:18:47 That may be true for those who have stocks but I haven't seen even grocery prices go down since the talk of high diesel prices were the blame for them going up! Avg PPL don't see things much better ourselves.

3202 2018-01-26 23:16:35 It's hard to see how stocks outperform residential real estate in a growing market purchased with a 30 year mortgage at 3.7% and 25% down.
3203 2018-01-26 23:16:21 : Stocks rising due to QE, ppl dropping out of labour market, Iran & Russia dealt with ISIS, 2 Koreas acting bilaterally…1/2
3204 2018-01-26 23:16:20 @jimcramer Hey Cramer my uncle is a huge fan of the stock world! He watches @MadMoneyOnCNBC every night :)  He's got 3 stocks that he invested in Sirius XM Radio, TrustCo Bank, and Groupon! Are they good long-term?? #MADTWEETS # titletown! #booyah!
3205 2018-01-26 23:16:01 Looking into getting into stocks .. this shit is interesting 
3206 2018-01-26 23:15:49 I heard his stocks plummeted today. Trump just takes his money from the USA coffers
3207 2018-01-26 23:15:07 While @WASenDemocrats advanced ban on bump stocks, Sen Pedersen said action unlikely on bills dealing w/high capacity magazines, enhanced background cks, safe-storage bills. “I don’t think so, not this year," he said. #waleg @WashingtonSRC @WAHouseDems @WaHouseGOP
3208 2018-01-26 23:14:32 Launching cannabis stocks okay haha
3209 2018-01-26 23:14:14 Today the Dow Jones reached near 27,000, at a price/earnings ratio of 28.6, higher than it was in September 1929. Operating cash flow is flatlining yet stocks are up 39% in a year. It's a question of when not if there will be a potentially catastrophic crash & loss of confidence
3210 2018-01-26 23:12:00 Never thought I'd see the day RT @Stalingrad_Poor: Things are so euphoric, even Alex Jones is a bull on stocks. Let that sink in.
3211 2018-01-26 23:11:56 If we assume a positive day for stocks as a result of “great economic reports,” or assume the market drops because of “worries about the Fed," we build a faulty cause-and-effect association into our analysis. It does not matter why XYZ moves; only how it moves. #metaphysics
3212 2018-01-26 23:10:59 @realDonaldTrump just got my paycheck..... there’s more $$  in it.  Thank you! @POTUS
3213 2018-01-26 23:10:43 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
3214 2018-01-26 23:10:33 Because the Turnbull government is absolutely useless

Trump as much as I dislike him and a lot of his policies he is making America a much easier place to do business(at the expense of environment), tax cuts will help stocks prices/business he is removing a lot of the red tape
3215 2018-01-26 23:09:49 It's a mix of different stocks. That's how the app works
3216 2018-01-26 23:09:01 Brian sell my stocks Stelter ??? Who cares what he says
3217 2018-01-26 23:08:04 They're all laughing stocks
3218 2018-01-26 23:07:13 You’ve heard of bump stocks once in your life and you act like it’s used in every gun crime

3220 2018-01-26 23:06:30 I find it interesting that the Wilshire 5000 only has ~3500 stocks.  Maybe  there are simply too few public companies today.  This is what happens when the public sells stocks for 19 years and buys bonds to such an extreme degree that interest rates go negative.
3221 2018-01-26 23:05:28 You cannot say you are customer centric if you use profits from customers to buyback stocks, which only benefits shareholders.

3223 2018-01-26 23:04:28 The dollar is down significantly. The dollar and stick market have inverse relationship, as dollar goes down, real assets appreciate (stocks) because they are worth more dollars.  Dollar is down because of low interest rate (and possible safety issue).
3224 2018-01-26 23:04:21 i am on the fence about that. i understand the arguments and havent decided either way on bump stocks to be honest
3225 2018-01-26 23:04:03 My stocks went down 5$

3228 2018-01-26 23:03:05 Robinhood is OP

3229 2018-01-26 23:03:00 I used to get pump and dump spam for penny stocks. Now it's for cryptocurrencies.
3230 2018-01-26 23:02:46 Do you trade stocks as well?
3231 2018-01-26 23:02:19 Maybe the whole tide pod thing was a scheme. Tide was going under and So they started the "eat a tide pod" challenge to raise their stocks back up!!! Or someone lost a bet, and said " hey, I bet I can make people do some stupid shit ;) " #TidePodChallenge

3233 2018-01-26 23:01:53 Serious: kid flipping burgers at local family run burger place asked me if I was into stocks (im short) . I said no. If I said yes, I’m certain stock tips would have followed along with stories of riches. I’m the poor  idiot and the burger flipper is a rich genius.
3234 2018-01-26 23:01:49 Scott deliver pls. Also what’s gonna happen with SEEK stocks?
3235 2018-01-26 23:01:31 Things are so euphoric, even Alex Jones is a bull on stocks. Let that sink in.
3236 2018-01-26 23:00:38 Bruh I love learning stocks.. I wish I knew about this shit when I was 17 smh
3237 2018-01-26 23:00:38 Every bluechips used to be penny stocks. Whats wrong with that?

3239 2018-01-26 22:57:30 What a world of Prudes the Dem-Libs-Fems are flipping to after decades of tits & ass on display, full sexual liberation and sexual capitalization. Puritan overreach and oppression and fear as all go to the stocks who have shared spit, rubbed skin, or asked
3240 2018-01-26 22:56:32 This could be reversal of lithium stocks getting hit hard for past 2 weeks. $fat also closed strong. $rez looking great. Good consolidation levels.
3241 2018-01-26 22:55:49 It’s an example, the stock will bleed for a few days unless bad news keeps flowing but eventually it will recover like most stocks it’s not going to drop one day then making new highs the next like all the call buyers today are now hoping.
3242 2018-01-26 22:55:00 Bon j'ai épuisé mn stocks là, si vs avez des idées partager pcq mon imagination a atteint sa limite
3243 2018-01-26 22:54:39 According to Wikipedia, 95% of his holdings are cash. Pretty obvious why he does not like Bitcoin. He also said “Never invest your money as though you are gambling at the casino. Buying and selling individual stocks is a waste of time."
3244 2018-01-26 22:54:30 Give a shout out.  You would be suprised at response.  I do that with a lot of stocks I own. Most companies that want to succeed listen to their consumers.
3245 2018-01-26 22:53:59 Well I know the stocks are record high but again a major reason for that is XFL announcement.... And while still WWE  is a shark in wrestling business.....the product has been struggling for ratings....
3246 2018-01-26 22:53:21 Just went in stocks sober, left 15 mins later. Dry jan is making me see life differently
3247 2018-01-26 22:52:25 Jeremy Grantham, rare interview on WealthTrack this weekend discussing rationale for his market melt-up scenario, why emerging market stocks are cheapest & his "hedge against regret" strategy
3248 2018-01-26 22:51:45 @OptionsAction Carter: follow up on top 6 tech stocks.  Still think AAPL is ready for up move?  vs. others as group?
3249 2018-01-26 22:50:44 Stocks are 2007 real estate - cheers happy weekend 
3250 2018-01-26 22:50:43 And 10% of Americans own 80% of all stocks, while 50% of Americans own no stock at all.
3251 2018-01-26 22:49:41 There was a reason stocks did a steady rise under obama, obama kept printing Money and Interest was Always guaranteed as well. So the Market was Virtually predictable. 
And If you Sold when Trump was Elected, you missed out YUGE!!!!!!!
3252 2018-01-26 22:48:41 Not only that, if the stocks keep going up and wages go up, and the money supply goes up, that's an inflationary trigger.
3253 2018-01-26 22:47:04 That don't mean a thing when only 30% of the country (to include companies, not including mutual funds) actually own direct shares of the stocks on the DJIA. And only 30 stocks make up the DJIA.

3259 2018-01-26 22:42:19 Every gun owner needs to #boycott #Massachusetts for their unconstitutional law regarding #bumpfire stocks. Their stupid law won't last a court challenge. You can't make ppl criminals for owning a legal item.
3260 2018-01-26 22:41:44 We can see artificial dairy products&live stocks are almost equals to real&Organic food products,similarly major organs of human body will be available in the stores exactly like real ones and that will happen not far from now.

3262 2018-01-26 22:41:20 Buy stocks.  Not bc things are so good, but bc they are so bad.
3263 2018-01-26 22:40:31 like Obama’s saying our darkest days are still to come. Our Potus (Trump) brought jobs back, tax cuts, etc. lowest unemployment, stocks 7 trillion , defeat ISIS! @brhodes @realDonaldTrump

3288 2018-01-26 22:27:52 Anyone's cabbie or Uber driver talk about stocks recently? @michaellebowitz @DiMartinoBooth @DavidBCollum
3289 2018-01-26 22:27:20 bump stocks are an outlier here. its a controversial device used nefariously in one mass shooting at this time. people have been bump firing with their belt loops before bump stocks were invented
3290 2018-01-26 22:26:50 BVB haven’t formally “accepted” the bid (even if they have privately) and won’t until they are certain the deal can go through I.e. after the medical. They can then announce the acceptance of the bid and the transfer complete in one go so stocks get less hurt
3291 2018-01-26 22:26:31 The volatile week is ending on a quiet note with MBS trading in a tight range for the past few hours. Stocks holding strong gains - Dow up 1
3292 2018-01-26 22:26:19 All that said, some of the top Canadian cannabis stocks are way over the $10 per share while still waiting to be fully legalized in July 2018. #SCNA has real revenue and lots of #BusinessGrowth, $30 mil last year should put it up to .10 this quarter or higher. @marijuanafund
3293 2018-01-26 22:26:10 Because nowadays, people try to not use stocks a lot, I mean I wrote it in my latests post too, but I wont do anymore
3294 2018-01-26 22:25:31 Bump stocks lessen accuracy. How would they help?
Shooting at what???
3295 2018-01-26 22:25:16 In wealth, sometimes an accumulation is enough, as in stocks, or cash, but other times, a collection is preferable, like in comic books or sportscards
3296 2018-01-26 22:25:07 You are focused on more than your core stocks now.  Huge day for everyone.  Cheers option holders
3297 2018-01-26 22:24:14 Ill give you an advice, dont flex with no stocks used in 2018
3298 2018-01-26 22:24:03 Right but we all know you can buy bump stocks that modify fire rate so nice try.
3299 2018-01-26 22:22:24 Look at nasdaq stocks also :)
3300 2018-01-26 22:21:53 Bump stocks were meant for shooters with disabilities. No they are not. Lets say you take semiauto guns....then shooters will use lever action and single action revolvers. Then you will clamor for them to be banned.
3301 2018-01-26 22:21:22 The minority opinion is that Bitcoin and similar products are another "bubble/crash" scam, preying on the fears of the reactionary, brainwashed masses, who still remember Y2K, 2012, and 9/11, and believe that traditional stocks & currencies are less safe than hacker instruments.
3302 2018-01-26 22:20:35 2 stocks I own are that and Netflix. Just crushing it
3303 2018-01-26 22:20:25 Sound suppression is just unnecessary unless you are in some type of law enforcement. Semi-automatic weapons ARE a problem. And what the hell would anyone need with bump stocks???
3304 2018-01-26 22:20:03 A weaker dollar sends investors to stocks and the reverse is true also.
trump is an idiot.
3305 2018-01-26 22:20:01 If I remember correctly I got the same crumbs from obama. I guess not much difference other than jobs coming back with Trump magic wand, don't forget record stocks and now I don't have to buy over priced health insurance that I can't afford to use
3306 2018-01-26 22:19:44 you only make money in stocks if you sell. equities and bonds are bubbled and ill bet gold will outperform stocks in the next year. im getting out of cash and putting it all in gold. in the next couple years ill see 50% to 100% gain
3307 2018-01-26 22:18:51 Gotts keep buyin ya products to keep ya stocks up 
3308 2018-01-26 22:18:21 Ok, well you still need a license for a sound suppressor, which is still loud enough to hear. Semi-auto weapons are not the problem, and bump stocks can be placed on the class 3 list with full auto weapons. What else?
3309 2018-01-26 22:18:17 Dude I'd like to give you the benefit of the doubt but penny stocks are predatory scams - they prey on the finically illiterate people who follow you might trust you and infer that things you endorse are equally trustworthy. I dislike wall street but 1p price is to warn ppl away
3310 2018-01-26 22:17:11 On the Economy Democrats look like absolute idiots. Stocks up 144%. Business booming. Businesses repatriating. Great Again! We owe it to Trump! @Politacs7 #Trump @realDonaldTrump #MAGA

3315 2018-01-26 22:14:26 No one believes the lies democrat Party sputters anymore. Stocks keep going up,everybody’s happy, nobodys NEGATIVE everyone’s POSITIVE. THEIR  lies fall on deaf ears.
3316 2018-01-26 22:14:08 I love that my new phone gives me updates on stocks. I think knowing about: nasdqu, Dow Jones, best buy inc., and Pepsi co. is good.
3317 2018-01-26 22:13:24 And why do people make so many assumptions!? How would you know what outrages I have and don't have??? This is why I can't have these conversations.

But if you really want to know, we don't need silencers, semi-auto weapons, bump stocks, etc just for starters.

3325 2018-01-26 22:10:49 These ETF's go through reverse splits nearly annually. $DGAZ went through one in March 2017 already. A reverse stock split won't impact these ETF's the way they do stocks because they are based on #natgas prices. Natgas does not do reverse splits so they are irrelevant.
3326 2018-01-26 22:10:31 Certainly not this record stock rise. The Obama economy was largely stagnant during the election year. The stocks took off after the election like a rocket almost immediately.

3389 2018-01-26 21:37:40 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-01-25, these stocks have buy signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (3/6):
3390 2018-01-26 21:37:20 $NDVA if you like weed stocks this one is DIRT CHEAP compared to all weed stocks do your homework for BIG DOLLARS
3391 2018-01-26 21:37:16 Still trying to figure that out. News is posted to there OTC page under news. PR was really vague!
3392 2018-01-26 21:37:14 This is unsatisfactory! We check our stocks regularly to avoid incidents like this. Sincerest apology for any disappointment caused Ems. :( Please return the packaging to store for refund/replacement. May I ask which of our store you purchased this from? Thanks, Sam
3393 2018-01-26 21:36:26 $WY !!! what a crazy day for this stock. I am happy to carry more stocks after price decline to 37. I am looking forward to chill out on saturday in mountains during #lh24 event as a support. And sunday...yes, market preparation is coming! :-)
3394 2018-01-26 21:36:17 And the run on bump stocks starts......... meow!
3395 2018-01-26 21:35:46 I think the stock movement this month is directly related to the tax reform that was passed last month. Stocks are pricy, but not greater than they were at the end of 2017.
3396 2018-01-26 21:34:48 $BABA and $JD, the two best stocks I have ever owned.
3397 2018-01-26 21:33:30 Waiting for oil stocks to go up snd hoping Q4s spark a much needed catalyst!

3399 2018-01-26 21:31:58 I know SeriousEats already had a hot pot feature, but would love to see more info - perhaps DIY stocks and bases (the other feature recommended store-bought stocks).

3401 2018-01-26 21:31:24 Today was a good day in stocks!
3402 2018-01-26 21:30:31 Can everyone at least agree stocks are finally a bubble? 
#Netflix $NFLX a $100 billion plus company is up 42% already in 2018.
3403 2018-01-26 21:30:19 Of course not! Just because a trading platform allows you to speculate on something, doesn't make speculation a useful activity. I'm also against people momentum/speculation-trading stocks and gold. Buy index funds and other productive assets, hold for most of your life.
3404 2018-01-26 21:30:07 Damn good day.  Soon as I get more liquid I'm gonna start delving into bigger cap stocks, just playing around with smallcap/penny right now.  $PIRS was my pharma pick last year.
3405 2018-01-26 21:30:02 @LedgerHQ Hi I would like to buy ledger nano s from your website. but it shows "As my cart contains an item not immediately available, I understand that my order will not ship before March 26, 2018". do you have any stocks in your online shop ?
3406 2018-01-26 21:29:32 What if stocks are rising precisely because it is NOT different this time?  Other nations w/stats like the US (fiscal, CB policy, wealth inequality, not having its deficits sterilized by global CB's) have their stocks do what US stocks are (see Venezuela for an extreme example.)
3407 2018-01-26 21:28:03 $IDXG nice accumulation under 1.15 for some time now...watching it closely over next week or so
3408 2018-01-26 21:28:00 Agree on banks. Exchanged some mutual funds earlier this year to get in on the banks rally . Watching several stocks for entry points.
3409 2018-01-26 21:27:58 I am in agreement with both rules and in same order. I’ll evaluate position at $5. I have pulled out my initial investment via trades that I have taken off. I have a stop in place if it would crater. The issue with OTC stocks is getting the limit filled
3410 2018-01-26 21:27:45 U.S. stocks, VIX dance in tandem in break with history #money #is #king #crypto or #fiat
3411 2018-01-26 21:26:59 Bank staff need compliance clearance to buy stocks on regulated exchanges. But speculating PA in unregulated payment systems used for laundering the proceeds of drugs and people trafficking: that would be ok, yeah?
3412 2018-01-26 21:26:57 Ah bah je t'en prie va regarder des stocks que certains ont pris tu vas vite voir que la situation était bien différente de ça :/
3413 2018-01-26 21:26:15 How much of the US population has stocks? That is what you should report on. Too few people benefit from this bubble.
3414 2018-01-26 21:26:11 Good week more most people’s stocks. Not for me with $PETS $AAPL and $SBUX all losing & making up almost half of my portfolio. #NeedToDiversify
3415 2018-01-26 21:25:49 E vamos de #NBBnoTwitter com Joinville e Caxias. Do lado dos gaúchos os destaques são os excelentes Cauês, Borges e Verzola. O Joinville, apesar da colocação, tem bons valores como o americano Stocks, dono de encerradas antológicas no @NBB e o bom ala Max
3416 2018-01-26 21:25:45 $CNIT 2.5s watching for bottom somewhere here and bouncing off this bottom sooner or later

3420 2018-01-26 21:24:44 Like in the ‘80s we go to Russia and bring the movie instead of silk stocks and french perfumes
3421 2018-01-26 21:24:33 That makes it closer to stocks than currency 

The purpose  of crypto should be closer to currency
3422 2018-01-26 21:24:22 Just divested from all of my WYNN stocks.
3423 2018-01-26 21:24:01 @mavericneo @AjAwesomecalls Thanks for your guidance and opening my eyes! I never thought I’d bank on high price stocks like ss $WYNN, long $OSTK, $INTC! What a rush! And of coarse thanks @SpartanTrading alert $BSPM for my gravy type plays!
3424 2018-01-26 21:23:55 Stocks had a monster week how about shitcoin?
3425 2018-01-26 21:23:26 American stocks are looking spicy, bring in the money
3426 2018-01-26 21:23:17 Courage to you Mr. president, Economy, Tax cut, Stocks, Jobs, Trades, despite all negative and depressing NEWS MEDIA, I am glad that I have switched channel.
3427 2018-01-26 21:22:31 The passion that Jo Williams from @homebrewhops has for quality, straight from the farm hops, is infectious. In the presence of us beer geeks who sapped her knowledge and she just kept giving. We are so looking forward to spending more time this year at Stocks Farms. Thank you Jo
3428 2018-01-26 21:22:28 I know exactly what you mean. My mentality for stocks is way different than crypto. Good coins or tokens in crypto have a project with purpose in mind. A public company who issues stock is just raising money to improve it's earnings and profit. Purpose > earnings
3429 2018-01-26 21:22:28 #GOAT market
 
#SuperBull or #SuperBowl ?? Haha stocks are ripping
3430 2018-01-26 21:22:14 Our stocks are doing so well that we're no longer afraid to invest again!
3431 2018-01-26 21:21:28 Stocks can stay over-valued or under-valued for much longer than most think. Markets are liquidity driven, not valuation driven.

3438 2018-01-26 21:19:22 Them Googles didn't want you to have a fair, educated, and open reasonable discussion on the topic of bump stocks because  C E N S O R S H I P. Especially around the time of the shooting. Kudos to Zack for being unbiased and fair during the video. 
3439 2018-01-26 21:19:17 US stock surge into the close. Records once again. Nasdaq leads the way
US stocks surged into the close and the major indices are going out at record highs and also very near the highs for the day.  The gains are starting to take your breathe away.
3440 2018-01-26 21:19:13 I’m just stoked that @Costco stocks it again. Propel is all I drink. I cut out soda. Not too big on the berry flavor but def watermelon and kiwi

3446 2018-01-26 21:16:55 $OPTT nice close ...watching it next week for 1.3s break
3447 2018-01-26 21:16:55 My stocks didn't move a lot in Nov and Dec when everyone else's did and now we're in Jan they're all moving up well when all the comments I read are about flat markets and boredom, funny old market sometimes, near double digit growth in Jan here  just awaiting the sucker punch!
3448 2018-01-26 21:16:49 Growth in our nation is unbelievable...never in the history of our country has one man been responsible for so much change in our economy than President Donald J. Trump.  Jobs are up, stocks are up, unemployment is down, and money is flowing back into our nation by the trillions!
3449 2018-01-26 21:16:36 Picked up so lowbpriced stocks his week. See how these picks turn out next week and beyond.
3450 2018-01-26 21:16:26 Yup, I know the feeling. It's been nerve racking watching my stocks get beat up over the last few weeks.

3453 2018-01-26 21:16:12 The new @RobinhoodApp for coins is sleek. But @RobinhoodApp you really need to give the user to set the filter on "Cryptocurrencies", "Stocks" and "Watchlist" lists. Changing the filter for one list shouldn't change the filter for all the list. cc: @AskRobinhood

3467 2018-01-26 21:12:36 I don't really have any stocks yet. I'm only now starting to diversify a little out of crypto. But crypto is my jam, ya know. I want the majority of my worth held in crypto. Because I believe in the projects. Im thinking 5% stocks, 95% crypto.

3501 2018-01-26 21:04:02 Yes, the market seems poised to roll on for a while - per @bpopken of @NBCNews—in my view, though, stocks aren’t likely to rise as steadily or quickly as in 2017.

3503 2018-01-26 21:03:20 As confidence in the stock market dips, we will see a reallocation of capital into the crypto markets. Profits are like drugs to an investor: give them a taste and they get hooked! After the success stocks have seen as of late, investors will not  sit around inactively.
3504 2018-01-26 21:03:14 Stocks closed at 99th record hi since election last Nov. TREND STILL UP, NO HEDGES. Risk remains at high levels to stops that can hardly keep up with this meteoric rise. Keep moving up stops and managing position sizes, reducing back if you need to and, enjoy the ride!
3505 2018-01-26 21:02:51 يعني مش بهي الصورة يا صديقي

3507 2018-01-26 21:02:45 بالنسبة لي 
بعد كل ما قرأت عن البتكوين
هي ليست للتعامل في الوقت الحالي
حتى تستقر وتتضح للجميع آلية عملها
وتصبح لها قاعدة بيانات محترمة
الموجودة بدايتها بكم سنت ونهايتها عشرين الف دولار
لا يمكن وضع قراءة لسلوك كهذا
ما فات في بحر وما حدث بعد انفجار السعر في بحر اخر
3508 2018-01-26 21:02:25 Earnings growing 10% per year, stocks on pace for 122% returns this year. How is that remotely justifiable?
3509 2018-01-26 21:01:43 First week my stocks I decided to hold through the weekend avoided a huge end of week selloff. Good feeling.
3510 2018-01-26 21:01:35 Good long term hold growth year over year
3511 2018-01-26 21:01:28 I’ve been managing my mums portfolio for the last 15 yrs , she loves a punt so I concentrate on making safe stocks look risky so she goes for themironically I’ve POA but love getting her to buy in to stuff of her own accord. She’s a one off
3512 2018-01-26 21:01:26 Congrats to all crypto investors who rotated into stocks at the bottom
3513 2018-01-26 21:01:04 You actually have skill i just spam stocks lol this is dope
3514 2018-01-26 21:00:55 Breaking (4:00 PM EST): Dow pops more than 200 points, stocks notch record close on strong earnings... -- CNBC
3515 2018-01-26 21:00:35 Wow.. i'm #hodling all my stocks.
3516 2018-01-26 20:59:50 تصدق
اطلعت على شارتات متنوعة للعملة الرقمية
لا نماذج واضحة ولا نقاط دعم ومقاومة واضحة ولا اداء اسبوعي ولا شهري ولا سنوي مرتبط بتحركاتها
العملية كلها حظ 90% وعشرة بالمية اجتهاد نسبة الخطأ فيه تسعين بالمية 
3517 2018-01-26 20:59:17 نعم سيدي الان الظاهره الاكبر من العملات الرقمية هو حمى ICOs  وهو الاكتتابات الرقمية
اصبحت العلامات التجارية تصدر عملات رقمية بغرض تمويل مشروعاتها واسماء كبيره اصدرت عملات وايضا بالمقابل الباب مفتوح لشركات الخشاش والنصب 

عالم كبير ومتسع جدا فعلا هل العولمة بأسمى معانيها
3518 2018-01-26 20:59:14 How’s your stocks doing?
3519 2018-01-26 20:59:06 it bothers me when i realize how much of the stock market stocks up compared to our debt and its ludicrous..even the 700 billion bail out of 2008..means nothing next to the 135 trillion in us obligations.
3520 2018-01-26 20:58:56 almost forgot....Bump Stocks.  Didn't we 'all' agree on those?
3521 2018-01-26 20:58:54 Company stocks lose cheddar
3522 2018-01-26 20:58:21 I have used Acorn as well. What I did was open a Robinhood account to trade and open a TDAmeritrade account with $10 to get all my technical stuff. But ever since I met crypto, what are stocks? For 2017 being my first year trading and investing, it was a super busy first year.
3523 2018-01-26 20:58:00 I am scared as seeing everything in green in my portfoli...
3524 2018-01-26 20:57:59 Such an epic short squeeze this week in stocks! Gotta love it if you’re trend following!
3525 2018-01-26 20:57:56 وبالفعل
البتكوين اليوم علامة تجاربة أكثر منها عملة
مثل الابل والسامسونغ والمرسيدس

3527 2018-01-26 20:57:03 والله ممكن
على فكرة...فكرة العملة تحدث عنها سامويل هانتغنتون قبل عقود
قال
ان العالم لن تحكمه الدول بل العلامات التجارية...ولن يخضع لعملة تسيطر عليها دولة، بل سيخضع لعملة لا تسيطر علبها اي دولة، عملة ستكون بمثابة العلامة التجارية شأنها شأن أي علامة تجارية أخرى
3528 2018-01-26 20:56:40 RT @jdroth: I like the mainstream financial media. They play an important role in education. But man, 90%+ of their content is IRRELEVANT. Who cares which 15 stocks have gained the most this year? How is that useful? Who cares when the DOW will hit 50,000? Come on, guys.
3529 2018-01-26 20:56:27 كلامك صحيح في ناس اعماهم الطمع ماردو علينا
وكانت المشكلها اغراء الوسطاء لهم بالشراء مع رافعة مالية كانت تصل الى 1:5 و 1:10

وهذا بالنسبة لنا ممنوع ولا ننصح به ابدا وفعليا من يشتري مع التصحيح وفقط برأسماله وشراء حقيقي وليس بنظام العقود

سيحقق ارباح قد لاتوفرها له الاسواق المحلية
3530 2018-01-26 20:56:17 Stocks on pace for record close.. The Trump economy is like a runaway freight train & it has the democrats running scared. They want him to fail, of course it will be at our expense. We want freedom and prosperity, they want identity politics and a failed welfare state. #MAGA
3531 2018-01-26 20:55:34 $OTTV I have Viva App, and was a very long time shareholder, but the dilution is killing the stock. Once I sold it, I made 5 x the amount of money in one day with other stocks. May buy back if dilution ends. GLTY
3532 2018-01-26 20:54:42 Given what is going on with commodities, stocks, and the dollar, the Fed with it's interest rates where they are appears woefully behind the curve - at least that is what the market's are saying
3533 2018-01-26 20:54:29 Congrats! BTW was it mostly from options or stocks?
3534 2018-01-26 20:54:11 شوف يا خوي
حين نقول ان العملة الرقمية فقاعة فالمقصود هو سعرها وليس وجودها
الفقاعات تتلاشى وكذلك سعر العملات الرقمية
كما حدث مع الدوت كوم مثلاً...بقت الدوت كوم وتلاشت الارقام
هذا ما يتنبأ به معظم المراقبين للعملة الرقمية
تلاشي الاسعار "فقاعة" مع استمرار العملة في السوق
3535 2018-01-26 20:53:54 Be wary of Internet stocks.  Golly.  The more I look the more concerned I am.  With both Soros+Trump against Internet stocks @ Davos up on the Internet outlook is perhaps worse than I thought.
3536 2018-01-26 20:53:47 Crypto is an inherently different game than stocks
If you have less then 1 $BTC I think it’s better to go all in on a sure deal.
3537 2018-01-26 20:53:29 Bro $POTN are literally gonna be paying for my car repairs. Thank Eva for pot stocks.
3538 2018-01-26 20:53:27 Trying to talk my dad into buying mutual fund / ETF. Tells me his brother made big loss on stocks- something about currency movements

This is the context I think in when hear objections to international bank acct as default savings vehicle for most people (no deposit insurance!)
3539 2018-01-26 20:53:13 Always easy to pick out the bottom feeders!  Obviously you don’t have stocks or a 401K.  Lmao!  Bless your heart.

3541 2018-01-26 20:52:37 نعم اتفق معاك ان ليست كل الاسعار مناسبة للدخول والشراء

وعلى مدار اسبوع احذر من البيتكوين عندما كان 19 الف واصدرنا في مركز ابحاث موقع نمازون تقرير خاص فني يؤكد عملية التصريف ورأينا بعد ذلك انخفاض السعر الى 9 الاف

لكن من يدخل مع التصحيحات السعرية ويقوم بالبناء الصحيح سيحقق ارباح

3547 2018-01-26 20:50:10 اشتقنا لنقاشاتنا من ايام المنتدى في 2005 الله يرحم هديك الايام 

شوف صديقي كلامك صحيح لكن لا احد ينكر ان العملات الرقمية حققت طفرات اكبر من الخيال والتصور وبقياس حجم الارتفاعات والفوليم والماركت كاب ومقارنتها باكبر الفقعات المالية نجد انها تجاوزتها بكثير واصبحت ظاهره وليست فقاعة
3548 2018-01-26 20:49:26 I still like $PBYI long. 1hr chart under pressure to move higher. Limit order long is in for Monday AM move. Stocks not reflecting overall market gains today, Monday could "catch up".

3556 2018-01-26 20:48:10 ليست بأسعار اليوم
ولا جنون اليوم
العملة ستسقر في نهاية المطاف في نطاقات سعرية معلومة وستخضع لرقابة عالية وستكون خاضعة للكلندر الاقتصادي والسياسي بطريقة او بأخرى
وفي النهاية ستطبع كأي عملة فيزيائية أخرى
3557 2018-01-26 20:48:07 Still no word on bump stocks.

3561 2018-01-26 20:47:03 BS.....only those with stocks benefit . The average Joe/Jane never benefits..those $1,000 bonuses are 1 time to appease the masses it would have been better to get the raise so you would have it forever...we are fools.
3562 2018-01-26 20:46:48 But Billy, your real world is not everyone's real world. The real crime in the United States is the widening equality gap. The top 1% own 93% of all stocks.
3563 2018-01-26 20:46:21 Actually my 401k is GREAT, stocks are up/taxes are down, companies are re-opening, people going back to work. It's quite nice ??
3564 2018-01-26 20:46:15 العملات الرقمية
عملية بلا مركزية
بلا تنظيم
بلا كلندر
بلا غطاء
غير مرتبطة بأي شيء سواء اقتصادي او سياسي
تذبذبها العالي يجعل من شبه المستحيل تداولها كأي عملة أخرى
فقد تأخذها اليوم بعشرة الاف وتبيعها بعد ساعات بسبعة
اراء الكبار حولها تكاد تكون متطابقة
العملة هي مستقبل التعاملات

3666 2018-01-26 20:36:57 ولكن تبقى الاسواق العالمية قابلة للتنبؤ المبكر لأنها تتمتع بشفافية عالية وكلندرها واضح وارقامها واضحة
مثلاً
ترامب جمهوري ومعروف منذ عقود أن الجمهوريون يفضلون الدولار الضعيف 
فمعظم المحللين راهن على ضعف الدولار منذ تولي ترامب الرياسة
3667 2018-01-26 20:36:34 I like the mainstream financial media. They play an important role in education. But man, 90%+ of their content is IRRELEVANT. Who cares which 15 stocks have gained the most this year? How is that useful? Who cares when the DOW will hit 50,000? Come on, guys.
3668 2018-01-26 20:36:03 That's a risky way of investing no? I get nervous not knowing what the company is doing that I'm invested in. Pot stocks are going to have gains unlike we've ever seen coming up soon. Legalization on this level is never seen before just remember that.
3669 2018-01-26 20:35:00 كل شيء من عملات وسلع وغيرها يتأثر بأمور بينة من تقارير واعلانات وعلى توقيتها وتوقعاتها يتم اتخاذ القرارات بالبيع او الشرء
وهناك احداث استثنائية غير مرتبة لعا تأثيرات معاكسة وهذه لا يملك اي احد التنبؤ بها أو توقعها
مثلا اليورو امسات، طلع مثل الصاروخ ورجع نخ بعد تغريدة من ترمب

3676 2018-01-26 20:32:07 Bump stocks are a great enhancement for every law abiding gun owner. Extremists think they know best what people should own and try to legislate their morality.

Yet codes are legal since no-one has put them together. Seriously pointless trying to get money from forex or stocks since no-one cares to fix it.
3685 2018-01-26 20:27:53 Fuck what I said earlier. I am trimming even more gains in these overvalued fucking stocks. Will put the shit to work in bonds next week. $$ $SPX $DJIA $VIX #IrrationalExuberance

3688 2018-01-26 20:26:57 Okay... you do know this is 2018. What would you suggest? Dragged through the streets? Beatings? Put in the stocks? Or something else? Yes I know what she said was so out of order and in bad taste. I don’t know her but again, I’m going to guess she regrets it. 1/2
3689 2018-01-26 20:26:47 Buy calls in stocks of the hot sector dujour, hold a couple of days, sell then buy more calls on whatever sector money is flowing into. wash rinse repeat. lol #meltup
3690 2018-01-26 20:26:04 I’m so bullish on gold mining stocks that I had to use margin funds to buy $gdx puts this morning. I don’t like writing calls even tho they would be covered.
3691 2018-01-26 20:25:42 Wow, hello #stocks. I'm predicting a surge in IPOs this year.
3692 2018-01-26 20:25:39 When Trump supporters lose their jobs hopefully they will realise what a fraud they have elected . How well the stock exchange is doing means nothing to people who don’t have stocks, shares or a job .
3693 2018-01-26 20:25:37 They’re too busy buying stocks...
3694 2018-01-26 20:25:15 The #WHL players at the #CHLTopProspects game appeared to be suffering from jet lag.  Outside of Florchuk..none of them helped their draft stocks. Fonstad and Sutter had trouble keeping up with the pace, Smith struggled defensively, esp. in 1st period.
3695 2018-01-26 20:25:11 Could be but remember we played Sanchez right to the end and Dortmund don't want the media knowing because of their stocks.
3696 2018-01-26 20:24:26 Wayne Gretzky said you miss 100% of shots you don't take Another crazy day for stocks
In this stock market, you hit 100% of the shots you take.
Everything is up, all the time. The S&P 500 is up another 0.9%, or 26 points, to 2865. It's a raging bull market that's gone into o…
3697 2018-01-26 20:24:22 I wanna buy stocks but idk how
3698 2018-01-26 20:23:56 It is unhelpful when the vast majority of tax breaks are benefiting the top 1% of earners and corporations who plan on using that money to buy back stocks from shareholders and pay off debt, NOT HELP CREATE JOBS OR INCREASE WAGES.
3699 2018-01-26 20:23:34 #Soybeans closed lower.  Wheat & Corn ended higher.  US #Dollar was lower.  Cattle, Crude & Stocks all higher today.
3700 2018-01-26 20:23:25 nice nice. i havent been following up to all their releases because its such a sure thing. seems like pot stocks might make an up trend the next two weeks then. $lg.v is also trending half decent
3701 2018-01-26 20:22:28 Wheat acounts for increase in Russia's total grain stocks. But barley stocks are marginally above last year whille corn stocks are 15 pct down last year.
3702 2018-01-26 20:21:17 Whatever happened to the massive stock market collapse that everyone said would occur after Trump was elected? Last I checked my stocks have been steadily increasing #stockmarket #Trump
3703 2018-01-26 20:21:09 Stocks continue to skyrocket!! Thank you @POTUS for helping me make money!

3724 2018-01-26 20:15:18 My point is, If its too good to be true, it usually is, and if its a real mover, its gonna take DD to stay up that high.  We want stocks that that move up based on DD, and stick to charts based on FIBS (Fibonacci) Stocks w Merit not just hype!  They'll move in due time!
3725 2018-01-26 20:15:11 Where's this big document of lies?  Here's the results: GDP over 3, record high stocks, 401k growth, more jobs, lower taxes, secure borders, over 6500 pedophiles arrested in 2017, all make America great again!  Results speak louder than your lame, uninformed opinion.

3769 2018-01-26 19:57:13 The imperative here is it that is THEIR money! And the people who have money are more likely to pay HIGHER SALARIES and DONATE money and buy STOCKS with THEIR money if they have lower taxes. That's democracy.

3803 2018-01-26 19:39:26 Oil went to 42 dollars in the summer based upon 2 key factors 1. doubt that OPEC+ was impacting stocks (due to a build) and 2. An increasing rig count was fomenting the shale over-production theory.  1. proved a wrong assumption.  2. was ameliorated by rig declines.  IMO.
3804 2018-01-26 19:38:55 yeah true i dont enjoy day trading i feel like alot of easy money is left on the table especially with small cap nasdaq stocks. I love swinging trash
3805 2018-01-26 19:37:59 Still waiting for that 4% growth. Looks like 4th quarter didn't even hit 3%. The stock market is high, but 93% of all stocks are owned by the top 10%. The bottom 90%, especially the lower 50%, are totally left behind. So far, all we have is some temporary paper gains in 401Ks.
3806 2018-01-26 19:37:57 I love stocks
3807 2018-01-26 19:37:55 Le sigh. $BTC can be bought in fractions unlike stocks. Along with other alternate projects. For instance, you can own just .01 $BTC.
3808 2018-01-26 19:37:40 Thanks for the great advice though #snowflake. Enjoy your #trumpbump on your stocks for the next 7 years. #maga isn't going anywhere
3809 2018-01-26 19:37:15 last april Goldman said FANG stocks over valued and mkt came off hard. Now they are twice as expensive, Complacency is way to high. we keep hearing a 7-15 pct pullback, but mkts go up 1 pct a day, so nobody cares
3810 2018-01-26 19:37:12 He’s done nothing but break everything. If the think that increased stocks are going to help you, you’re a fool. It’s the top 1% buying stock not middle class

3813 2018-01-26 19:35:44 We live in Oklahoma, where his policies and regulations decimated our economy. Stocks are one thing, but when you run a service based business and 50% of your clients lose your job, or are affected by it, it's a big deal. #racism has nothing to do with it. #FridayFeeling

3822 2018-01-26 19:31:15 mostly all call options this week. hardly any put trades... one sided for sure. but this stock is the biggest laggard of all chinese stocks (mid caps). so to some deg. it's catch up trade
3823 2018-01-26 19:30:12 Hardly. Plus the international stocks would have no impact.
3824 2018-01-26 19:29:33 Oh it’s much, much better than recent years for sure. For a while there football and basketball were the laughing stocks of the league. I’m just hoping we can pick it up and have a good enough run to make the NIT, or at least strong consideration for it. It’d be a lot of progress
3825 2018-01-26 19:28:50 huge call buys for 12.5 and 15 strikes.. hardly any put activity. one sided options this week. still under IPO price while China stocks r on tear - biggest laggard in china sector

3827 2018-01-26 19:26:20 Well, if you are happier with Trump giving all the tax breaks to the uber wealth to pad their own stocks while the 99% pay for it than I can't help you. Keep supporting the rich #DotardDonnie who doesn't do anything at all for you. #TaxScam GOPtaxscam #complicitGop #idiots
3828 2018-01-26 19:25:23 Hi @Fozziebear1964 

Didn’t think anyone would be keeping count  Yes, I’ve just over 20 stocks & won’t go much higher than this. I’m disciplined but look at opportunities on share by share basis...NOT trying to over-complicate works for me. 

Keep things simple!
What about you?
3829 2018-01-26 19:24:53 The money given to banks benefited the 1% rich through stocks and shares check how the  stock market preformed around 2011 ish money to the mass population got tighter because banks were unwilling to help out
3830 2018-01-26 19:22:18 If a 1987 crash were to happen today, a -20% drop would put the S&P at 2,290, last seen in January of 2017 (a drop in the bucket). An 80% drop would put the S&P back at the highs right before the 2007-08 crash. No, stocks are not a bubble at all.
3831 2018-01-26 19:22:04 $XIV is back down again!  Looks like more people are buying protection as the stocks appreciate more!
3832 2018-01-26 19:21:14 $CANN isn't as exposed to risks as other #cannabis #stocks good opportunity to buy low.
3833 2018-01-26 19:20:31 Stocks going up makes people feel wealthier so they spend more, and combined with modest wage growth this makes spending go up faster than income, which must mean lower savings
3834 2018-01-26 19:20:16 Hard for some to realize that you can be wrong 50%+ of the time and still make a fortune. Majority of gains come from a minority of stocks.
3835 2018-01-26 19:19:59 This is for penny stocks?
3836 2018-01-26 19:17:41 “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed”. Hmmm, nothing about bump stocks. And all the dude in the video is doing is showing how easy it is with a .22
3837 2018-01-26 19:17:25 Unless you are a day trader and  watching stocks to sell at the right time you have to expect them to ebb and flow.
3838 2018-01-26 19:17:01 your error is thinking that some of these scam stocks have any direct correlation to Bitcoin.

3840 2018-01-26 19:16:06 Someone genuinely thought you wore them like this when I told them about the bib stocks!
3841 2018-01-26 19:15:51 What? That is as clear as mud. Are you saying wage growth is too modest to boost savings or that savings are down because rising stocks are too alluring?
3842 2018-01-26 19:15:43 Hi Bee, our Milton Regis Express only sells the peanut butter flavour and is showing to have 16 in stock and our Canterbury Road Express stocks the mint chip flavour however is unfortunately sold out. 1/2
3843 2018-01-26 19:15:10 Like they always do.  People keep comparing bitcoin to stocks and gold.  Bitcoin is a network.  A growing independent economic community.   Those comparisons don't apply.
3844 2018-01-26 19:14:10 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
3845 2018-01-26 19:12:55 Capitalism is simply defined as private ownership of the means of production. If you think people should be allowed to own stocks, LLCs, etc... then you’re a capitalist.

Reshaping the welfare state and so forth is reinventing things but capitalism remains in place.
3846 2018-01-26 19:12:51 Closet indexers , Yes but there are some that actually pick stocks.

3849 2018-01-26 19:11:46 @IFTTT I seem to be having problems with the stocks app. It seems to have stopped working completely for me. Any idea why?
3850 2018-01-26 19:10:36 Because the moneyed ones can manipulate stocks and other markets-kind of insider trading -but legally avoiding penalties
3851 2018-01-26 19:10:24 @RevShark 2 stocks you might want to keep an eye on-AYX -growing revenues at a rapid pace & a unique co. in a crowded field-BTX gone nowhere for years-much hated, but making real progress with pipeline & aesthetic product should get EU approval soon-USA later
3852 2018-01-26 19:10:15 The funny thing is the client missed out on massive gains because he was stuck in a balanced portfolio when he should have been more in stocks cause NO ONE compares market risk/opportunities along with personal risk profiles. Drives me up wall
3853 2018-01-26 19:09:57 Today might be the least impressive new high in stock market history.  52% of stocks down.
60% decline in Volume. 

Keep buying suckers 
3854 2018-01-26 19:09:19 Thought i would try @RobinhoodApp turns out they dont carry useful or newer stocks like Cannabis company’s but worse you cant close an pull your inital money back out!!  Suddenly they dont answer EMAILS #FraudNewsCNN #stocks @FTC

3858 2018-01-26 19:07:39 It is interesting on its face but its know that the company was bought out and that the Clintons just had stocks in the company because they were friends with the original owner.
3859 2018-01-26 19:06:22 That’s why you invest in both crypto and stocks 
3860 2018-01-26 19:05:47 Hey, did you know Bump Stocks are still legal?
3861 2018-01-26 19:05:16 My friend with the sprint and under armour has these stinky stocks because of robinhood, I talked to him today and he says he's excited to get into crypto. I've stopped shilling to him long ago so let's see if he wants to talk again

3870 2018-01-26 19:01:27 Long ago, Ben Graham taught me that 'Price is what you pay; value is what you get.' Whether we're talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down.
3871 2018-01-26 19:01:15 @TheLincolnList You've mentioned before in one of your videos using the ATR indicator. Does that indicator apply to news/earnings driven stocks? Or is it just for regular day to day stock moves?

3873 2018-01-26 19:00:25 The innovation of printing money and buying stocks is just brilliant!
3874 2018-01-26 19:00:07 The only ones nervous are the perma bears who have said to sell since March 2009. Stocks have steamrolled the euphoric sentiment surveys in unprecedented fashion. Wonder if the top will look like NASDAQ 2000 or the typical long, rolling one.

3894 2018-01-26 18:50:08 The Dow reaching 26,000 is not a fair representation of today vs. 8 years ago.  The stocks that made up the Dow Jones 8 years ago are not the same stocks that make up today.

3905 2018-01-26 18:44:18 Hey friends! I’ve been using this app for a little over 6 months and have done pretty well on it. It’s a great app to buy and sell stocks without paying the normal fees. The link will be below in another tweet! Goodluck!
3906 2018-01-26 18:43:44 In the week ended Jan 24th. Stocks saw global inflows of USD 33 billion. American Stocks saw inflows of USD 7 bln, Europe USD 4.6 bln and Emerging Markets USD 8.1 bln. India benefited with Foreign inflows in Indian Markets crossing USD 1 bln .
3907 2018-01-26 18:43:35 I’m not sure anyone would prepare anything but fast and bouncy when you have SA’s fast bowling stocks. You can’t get away from the fact that when a team gets 220 in a t20 and the bowlers get nothing, everyone thinks it’s a spectacle. Finally the bowlers dominate, it gets slammed!
3908 2018-01-26 18:43:03 Think this is a long-term move into crypto or just an extremely savvy customer acquisition play? Come for the crypto, stay for the stocks!
3909 2018-01-26 18:42:47 I’ve made more money in the past year holding Canadian cannabis stocks than I have in crypto trading. Anyone else playing both? #aphria
3910 2018-01-26 18:42:08 @POTUS44 @WSJ @FTC Anybody who sold Google, Facebook, Twitter or Reddit stocks is going to fucking Federal prison for RICO ACT conspiracy charges at the very least and Treason for those who interfered with me reaching the public.  @FBI @CIA @DHSgov @SecretService @USCommandCyber
3911 2018-01-26 18:41:07 No but anybody who's the least but informed knows that they have already been seen record profits and stocks are already at record highs, so why give a giant tax break and put ourselves into trillions of dollars of deficit just so they can get even richer.

3923 2018-01-26 18:37:57 Yeah it's more accessible to most than stocks so it's bringing in more average Joe's. Which is a good thing, but they do get rekt at times. Good job helping educate them 
3924 2018-01-26 18:37:51 Yes, but you would have had to SPEND more to get more shares. The stock split won't lead to a situation where you get more dividends. The dividend splits along with the stocks. It's a common misconception, people refuse to get it.
3925 2018-01-26 18:37:38 Oh fuck it. Free and stocks go well together

3928 2018-01-26 18:36:45 YES!!!! I'm tired of hearing about "stocks are up".

3933 2018-01-26 18:34:47 @KAL79 @DocThompsonShow @realKrisCruz, I heard that @RobinhoodApp is soon getting into the trading of crypto along with regular stocks all commission-free (though a waiting period between putting money in their app to actually buying stocks/crypto unless u pay extra). Thoughts?

3946 2018-01-26 18:29:39 Are you really young or do you have the memory of a fish? In 2008 I put money into the stock market because stocks were dirt cheap. I’m 30 and I made my retirement. Not touching that money till I’m 60. Only 20% is in the market though.
3947 2018-01-26 18:29:36 الظاهر أن اللي معك كثار
3948 2018-01-26 18:29:30 Probably, just wait. Study history, when stocks go very high they also far very low. When no one buys from your farm or businesses can you live of your 401k (if it is still there) for an extended period of time.)
3949 2018-01-26 18:29:21 131. There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.

3989 2018-01-26 18:12:12 It's not an uncomplicated issue. Republicans can just say "stock market up" and they're done. Dems needs to explain the concept of what the stock market is and who owns a majority of the stocks before they can start to make a point about things like stock buybacks, growth, etc.

4003 2018-01-26 18:08:17 Oops - I forgot Pfizer.  They are facing LOE's on some of their major brands, which will significantly lower their profits.  Since their stocks skyrockted over exclusivity of these drugs, it is projected to decline rapidly.  They are planning for the inevitable.
4004 2018-01-26 18:07:59 George Soros is also hating on Facebook and Google right now. His main goals are to short stocks when he sees an opportunity. I think NN is some nuanced legal bs that nobody for or against it understands. It's like a silent pawn move that will have an impact 10 moves later.

4035 2018-01-26 17:52:05 I had a dream where I was playing Zelda against @XanIota and I think he was playing Bayo
I knocked down two stocks, but then he switched to Zelda last stock(?) and half the time my moves had NO hit stun or knockback

But my brain's an egotistical bitch so I somehow still won lmao

4037 2018-01-26 17:51:35 Democrats should point out that excess demand for stocks aren’t an indicator for the overall economy. And two quarters of GDP growth over 3% isn’t remarkable-Obama had 8 quarters over 3% and Fox never mentioned it, so you KNOW it’s not remarkable. So where’s the win?

4041 2018-01-26 17:50:59 Beat me to it @shane_allenn! I don’t know why it’s so hard to understand that stocks are more a reflection of corporate health and has little to do with economic health. Since ~80% of Americans don’t own stock, stock market growth has little effect on the average citizen.

4048 2018-01-26 17:46:29 Curious.  If companies are buying back their stocks because of the #GOPTaxScam  would that drive up the markets?
4049 2018-01-26 17:45:36 Right? It's so true. Tip: sometimes the Marshalls in Solana stocks really killer formal dresses from outrageous designers. I once picked up a very cool Helmut Lang gown for not much money. Stop there on the ride up?
4050 2018-01-26 17:45:12 Every time the stock market has declined, it eventually has more than fully recovered. Hedging the stock market by shorting stocks, or by buying puts on the S&P 500 Index, or any other method usually is expensive, and, in the long run, is a waste of money. -- Ed Wachenheim

4077 2018-01-26 17:34:27 The best thing about stocks like $BYOC is (if played right) that they are absolute life changers for many people. This is still in the early stage, just imagine once the rest of the acquisitions are announced, once it uplists, and much more. Absolutely a millionaire maker.

4169 2018-01-26 16:58:52 Most ICOs represent a quick way for founders to get rich.

4198 2018-01-26 16:48:46 Many of these cannabis stocks represent buying into oligopolies early for pennies on the dollar. Yes, barriers could be broken by quick government decisions.

4214 2018-01-26 16:43:34 Great point — claiming that the economy is controlled from the hands of the Trump admin gives credibility to his claim that growth in stocks, investment and decline in unemployment is due to his policies and not an uphill climb from ‘09

4302 2018-01-26 16:17:16 Cost of living keeps rising, but the incomes of the masses do not. We will start seeing more and more dramatic downturns very soon, IMO. Why should it matter if stocks are doing well? That just means companies are having huge profits (currently our expense), it's unsustainable.

4331 2018-01-26 16:04:54 Indices are missing 'this time is different' narrative we know from dot com bubble or crypto world. It was the new economy on Nasdaq AD2000 and a new decentralized economy in Crypto AD2017. No fancy story for stocks so far.
4332 2018-01-26 16:04:10 It seems that money is flowing into a few popular stocks which are driving the index higher. Thats why when you look at the rest of the stocks in broader market they look anaemic. Its crowding in the market. I wonder if there is some convenient metric to measure this phenomenon?

think of internet (blockchain) vs. AOL (BTC).

a blockchain app has zero to do with bitcoin.

while it's true that *today* BTC hype boils over into blockchain stocks - the internet did great while AOL became nothing.

Also, many "average" Americans don't have stocks or even 401K's, gains there aren't a great sell for R's.

Of this, wheat accounted for 29.9 MMT against 24.11 MMT year ago. Low  & flat wheat prices will be like an anchor for other grain prices.

4699 2018-01-26 14:12:02 Powers that be will only do something when the fish stocks are so depleted there's virtually none left. But then what? Restocking rivers? otter cull? It's a mess
4700 2018-01-26 14:11:18 Yes it can. That's what buffer stocks do. The objective is to optimise stocks whilst maximising sales. You attempt to smooth out flows to take account all scenarios. Complete blockages occur all the time.
4701 2018-01-26 14:10:33 BIG list here for me today. Watching well over 8 stocks this morning which is crazy. Quality control is sky high today.
4702 2018-01-26 14:10:24 HS jumped in at the wrong time then NBF filed 3(a)10 and stock went downhill, HS got burned and pissed now bashing stocks that he used to pump few months ago
4703 2018-01-26 14:09:36 We no longer have any FDA approved YF vaccine available in the US. It has been a problem for years now  and even the yet to be approved vaccine is in critically short supply. Even in other countries it is being given diluted, not as full strength to stretch the stocks.
4704 2018-01-26 14:09:25 I’m fortunate enough to be able to invest. My stocks has been doing really well since Obama’s recovery pulled us out of the shitter. Here’s my tip to you:
Sell high.

4731 2018-01-26 13:59:41 1st lesson of 2018: I've been underexposed to stocks for months now, mainly listening to gurus talking about the overbought indexes for months!. Next time, listen the market and just ride the trend until the pullback comes. One would be better off than holding back just in case

@POTUS lies--on a regular basis to deceive and line his pockets. Rising stock market doesn't help people who don't own stocks in companies.
4735 2018-01-26 13:56:29 It is spin when the Rs are telling companies to hype these bonuses to make the tax cuts look good, while they're taking the rest of their billions to boost their own stocks and fire more people.
4736 2018-01-26 13:55:46 Meanwhile a man is sitting in the WH charging the men protecting him for using golf cart at his own property. I will take the man who bought stocks in a heartbeat.

4754 2018-01-26 13:46:31 The economy is "better" for the 1%, which owns 80% of stock. The limited benefits of avg Americans are short lived, while the benefits for the 1% is permanent. Using the stock market as an indicator of economic health only concerns those who own the stocks: the 1%

4758 2018-01-26 13:44:13 It makes one question the data. I see same thing in $XBI data though. Remember I was talking a 5-6% drawdown. I presume some of the drawdown replaced by arb funds though. If 10% of done deal stocks in arb hands that is $2 billion, swamping outflows.
4759 2018-01-26 13:43:57 You know who has tons of stocks & retirement funds? Trump, & his pockets are only growing fatter with his corruption of our govt.

4814 2018-01-26 13:18:57 You realize they dont have to operate within the USA right? So SEC registration is irrelevant as to whether its a scam. Also, stocks and premined tokens have nothing to do with each other.
4815 2018-01-26 13:18:46 I think you are right on point in your ‘18 strategy given the positive but high priced stock market: 1) Reinvest dividends in existing stocks you own, 2) limit “reaching” to buy expense stocks, 3) build up dividends for passive income! Financial freedom is hard but worth it!

4949 2018-01-26 11:45:39 I have CBI on all my stocks. Don’t you?  It guarantees that if my stocks go down that they will soon go up again. ( even if I buy inexplicably overpriced stocks). It works. Guaranteed!!! Central Bank Insurance is great. Everyone has it.

5171 2018-01-26 08:13:04 Here's a good one for you. At the grocery store tonight the cashier was bragging on how well Trump was doing.

So I asked him what Trump has done for him and he told me.
Trump made him $47,000 on stocks last year.

Now get this picture this man works as a cashier at Albertsons.
5172 2018-01-26 08:12:11 Both exchanges are way undervalued against peers.  People busy buying #TRIN and #CERP when obvious bigger value and upside is in #TXP - all are good stocks but you hunt value for returns.  MCAP is way to low, 10 wells should see 2000-2200bopd.

Solid signals from the futures market so far. Asian stocks are also faring quite decently on the day, with only the Nikkei bucking the trend.

Asian shares are mostly higher on the day, except for the Nikkei. The index closed lower, dragged down by energy and financial stocks. Energy stocks were down by a whopping 3.42% on the day.

5193 2018-01-26 07:54:14 I see signs of euphoria in stock market. People who have never bought stocks are picking random names based on TV channel recommendations. Worst part is no counseling helps here as the newbie believes himself to be an expert already.
5194 2018-01-26 07:54:02 I don't think #FIAT market is as affected because it isn't so liquid. Crypto money comes in and out really quickly. Long-term investments like stocks, equities, ETFs, don't tend to move as quickly.

5343 2018-01-26 05:36:14 Depends on you po pero while stocks last lang po tayo.
5344 2018-01-26 05:33:25 There are still many stocks.

5358 2018-01-26 05:16:42 I want more than banning bump stocks. I want serious curbing of guns of all kinds. Push the envelope beyond what currently enjoys bipartisan support
5359 2018-01-26 05:16:31 You guys keep saying market hasn’t starting this well since 1987 and dollar hasn’t seen this type of decline since 1987 so should I sell all positions in September and short the crap out of stocks in October as they say history in stocks repeats itself?

5365 2018-01-26 05:12:06 The new Democratic majority in the Senate is hard at work on our popular progressive agenda - banning bump stocks, standing up for DREAMers, protecting voting rights, banning conversion therapy, campaign finance reform, and more. Exciting stuff! #waleg

5372 2018-01-26 05:06:39 cryptocurrencies and real estate are terrible investments. Stick with roth IRAs and some stocks that match your risk portfolio

5374 2018-01-26 05:04:04 Meanwhile in Massachusetts: "I bet we can make an ex-post facto ban on bump stocks and force confiscation without compensation... Here, hold my beer while I snub the constitution, I got this..."

5385 2018-01-26 04:49:52 Why would they want to ban bump stocks?

5400 2018-01-26 04:40:56 How did they incur risk when they owned stock for less than a day? The whole purpose of stocks was to allow people to invest in companies and enable faster than organic growth. Not to allow for someone to own stock for 24 hours and make 5% profit on the sale.

My name is Greg Walker, a military officer with the U.S. Army living in Houston, TX. Very interested in learning your product and teaching on penny stocks . What advice would you give to beginners?
5427 2018-01-26 04:13:35 Totally unethical! He should lose his law license and be in prisoner for unethical behavior! Martha Stewart went to prison for back dealing stocks. Hillary bought this mans ethics and integrity and He should have known better!

5429 2018-01-26 04:12:54 So the dudes in 1791 sat around their candlelit table and said, “you know we need to make sure people can have bump stocks and silencers/suppressors”? How is it “liberal anti gun nuts” to think NO ONE needs these?! Have your precious damn gun, no one needs a bump stock.
5430 2018-01-26 04:11:37 (oops ... I should read more closely ... I thought this tweet by Grant had to do with SNB purchases of stocks ... not that I think that central banks want to prop up markets)
5431 2018-01-26 04:11:14 got bored and found two penny stocks that would yield me ridiculous profits if i'm right in about 2 years. thanks robinhood
5432 2018-01-26 04:11:02 Robinhood makes money from people buy and selling stocks on margin
5433 2018-01-26 04:06:51 They already do for stock trading pretty good app I just started using last year. It shows you related articles to the stocks.
5434 2018-01-26 04:05:15 Also drunk trading stocks after hours  poor choices here we come!
5435 2018-01-26 04:04:05 Don't be surprised when Republicans push Meehan out ... he voted against their healthcare reform, wants to #ActOnClimate, ban bump stocks, let states decide who can carry guns, and is pro-Davis–Bacon.

5448 2018-01-26 03:59:53 Republicans are already laughing stocks. And they’re making America one, too, sadly. Every day is a fresh laugh at these bozos. The Dems had better wipe the floor with them!

5453 2018-01-26 03:56:20 For a company growing at 60% bottom line the P/E of 100+ is extremely high. Going forward the PAT growth will go below 50%. We might see a couple of years of consolidation in the stock going forward. 
Just my view m not invested in any FMCG stocks.

5478 2018-01-26 03:36:58 The Green Bay Packers are a publicly owned team, let's do that with the @BostonBreakers. 

I'd buy stocks!

5479 2018-01-26 03:36:00 The truth is the the Dow was at 14,100 October 2007, when investors saw that a BLM community organizer was going to win the presidency, everyone and their brother unloaded their stocks, markets crashed. It took 8 years and the Fed dropping rates to 0 to recover.

5487 2018-01-26 03:30:01 You would be surprised Alex how traders trade each others plays, sometimes quietly, sometimes publicly, but it takes people to move stocks, Why fight the money train when there is money to be made, We are all familiar with each other and we share the same goal > to make money
5488 2018-01-26 03:28:11 I remember watching/holding $appl peak around $132 in 2015 and sink slowly and painfully to the $90s for the next year. It doesn’t act like other stocks so...good luck figuring the buy in, I just close my eyes, ignore it and hodl in slow motion.
5489 2018-01-26 03:28:04 What do I say when someone asks me if they should buy airline stocks? Sometimes a good eye roll just won't do it.
5490 2018-01-26 03:26:49 Ok I will match the bond
I will pull all my stocks out of NBC
I know part of the business moves going on 
Working of females thing got there late but better late then never
Other personal money knowledge I have to hold or throw away
5491 2018-01-26 03:24:56 Don't feel bad for us....while some stocks are up 50% since last January,  we experience this increase on a weekly or monthly basis.  Haha!  CryptoforLife!
5492 2018-01-26 03:23:50 * Vietnam stocks up as much as 1.7 pct to 1,123.83, highest since may 2007
5493 2018-01-26 03:23:37 this is how tops are formed. the the crowd is sitting in stocks that have been bought at ridiculous prices are the forced to sell.
5494 2018-01-26 03:23:01 Lmao, I've never seen someone lose so much. The stock market is not the economy, 2 very different things. So when stocks drop is it your fault?
5495 2018-01-26 03:22:53 Isn’t that what we do with EVERY investment?  Stocks, houses, art, metals?
5496 2018-01-26 03:22:40 $HSI +1%. Banking stocks such as China Construction Bank $939.HK +4%, Industrial & Commercial Banks $1398.HK +3.4% and Bank of China $3988.HK +2.61% leading the charge within the index. Energy stocks is the laggard today as Oil retraced gains overnight.
5497 2018-01-26 03:22:22 this is quintessential wave five behavior. #stocks
5498 2018-01-26 03:22:05 The #cryptocurrency market is different now. It's exploded onto the public scene,  forever changing history.  But volatility in the space has peaked. Gone are the days of ridiculous profit with basic #hodling unless researching what are basically penny stocks. No more free ride.
5499 2018-01-26 03:21:20 Who else needs advice about stocks and transfer value listings. Atiba???
5500 2018-01-26 03:18:42 She's right. He bet on the US failing. I use a financial manager. Trading not my thing, but basically their are several places to put money that might gain if US stocks went down. Currencies, gold, silver, or stocks in other countries, Someone who trades can tell you more.
5501 2018-01-26 03:18:27 One more thing, Pres. Obama came
into office with double digit unemp.
Housing mkt. In deep trouble.
Wall Street and stocks crashed.
Its called recession. rump entered office with 4.4 unemp. And stocks
at 18.
5502 2018-01-26 03:17:19 I have idea to code an indicator which would count how many stocks inside each sector ETF has closed over / under S1. That may be an interesting type of breadth indicator. What do you think?
5503 2018-01-26 03:17:04 Well there ya go. I’m gonna invest in something I know is certain like Dollar General stocks because they are always building more of those 
5504 2018-01-26 03:17:04 All those Stocks  are just off the base .. nice ones twinsy 
5505 2018-01-26 03:16:44 It "depends" on if I have enough stocks to switch. Hahaha!
5506 2018-01-26 03:12:16 hi Hannah, great to see you here. been trading stocks and options for 20+ yrs (since teenager). i'd say it took me roughly 5-6 yrs to really understand what trading is (e.g., charts, discipline, acct management, etc.). then another 3-5 yrs to really develop my own system.
5507 2018-01-26 03:11:57 Hallow the friction between treating people stay in stocks.
5508 2018-01-26 03:11:46 @jimcramer How do you feel about Cannabis stocks now that California has legalized marijuana for recreational and medical use? 
5509 2018-01-26 03:10:51 I am a  big fan of Buy now sell now weekend. Unfortunately the program is not coming since last few weeks. Even all about stocks is also gone

5511 2018-01-26 03:08:36 Since moving to Denver I’ve found it difficult to get ingredients I need to make curry. It was easier to get international foods, including British stuff, when I lived in Florida. I’ve yet to find somewhere that stocks international foods I could get in a regular store in Florida
5512 2018-01-26 03:08:23 Oh yeah... somehow this has fall off my radar... i hold 300 of them since it was around 80s during the demon time... traded too between 90-144... When some of the other stocks also went up like RS software Quick Heal TVS Electronics .... Will surely add datamatics now... Thanks.
5513 2018-01-26 03:07:32 Tell me the last time a mass shooting occurred with an full auto rifle? I personally dont care for bump stocks. I take it you probably have never shot anything but your mouth
5514 2018-01-26 03:07:18 @jimcramer Schlumberger, one of the weakest stocks in the AAP Portfolio  with an average cost basis of around $73 and a recent buy in December, it hasn't moved much. Stock isn't impressive, should be removed. Not happy with this one.
5515 2018-01-26 03:07:12 Pretty solid but I don't use as don't have time for picking and choosing stocks. Prefer wealthfront style passive investing
5516 2018-01-26 03:05:48 @WarrenBuffett and a BITCOIN INVESTOR both walk into a bar. They both walk out immediately, as neither stocks nor bitcoin is ACCEPTED as a PAYMENT METHOD.
5517 2018-01-26 03:05:37 When one of your "preferred" stocks seems to be in either a consolation mode or downtrend like $AAPL or $BIDU what indicators do you watch for a reversal to enter a trade
5518 2018-01-26 03:05:05 Read charts. Read News. Read Financials. Read Financial Reports. Read Quarterlies. Read Disclosure Filings.

Read, read, read.

That's what gets you ahead with stocks.

5520 2018-01-26 03:04:30 I understand you don't determine kitchen stocks, but maybe don't partner with a restaurant that can't offer your vegan burger in a vegan fashion? Was the company aware this was the case when you reached an agreement with @umamiburger? Or discovered later?
5521 2018-01-26 03:03:53 It adjusts to burn less fuel and put more away. And sends urgent messages to the brain, "FIND FOOD" because survival depends on it. When the famine is over, it still builds up stocks.
5522 2018-01-26 03:03:39 Hahaha! Penny stocks all over again.
5523 2018-01-26 03:03:35 Idc how many green stocks you've invested in! Crypto is all based off of algorithms right? That's energy you fool! Hella energy

But all I really want is to buy is some  index funds.

5538 2018-01-26 02:56:18 I just believe we need to put up a fight every time the government tries to take away or restrict something with our guns. If we let them take bump stocks they’ll go after certain triggers next and it’ll never end.
5539 2018-01-26 02:55:52 I don't know how to buy OTC stocks

5542 2018-01-26 02:53:44 Hi, just seeing your tweets. They are truly backed by data and cutting emotional play. The likes of stocks are also in the short list. Good analysis and good role model for small traders like us who wants to trade with discipline and not by emotions. If data says yes means "yes"
5543 2018-01-26 02:52:58 Finally got approved today to begin investing in stocks 
5544 2018-01-26 02:52:29 I saw that. Is this the system that you've done stocks on before?
5545 2018-01-26 02:52:05 @TripleH So Vince is starting up the XFL, selling huge amount of stocks too do so, & since WWE been on a budget its probably true its going too be sold too Fox by next year & in doing so making the show go from PG to G and end up losing views that will end up having people fired
5546 2018-01-26 02:51:28 Same with me, I finally decided that it’s a company that I root for and know quite well so investing in a couple stocks feels right.
5547 2018-01-26 02:50:36 You must have been a minor in 2008. Stocks, 401ks, jobs tanking in the Bush recession, Obama’s administration help turned it around, made the economy boom for you. Unless you’re in the approx top 1/4 income bracket, tax cuts end in about 7 years.
5548 2018-01-26 02:49:46 “Deflection” did we expect anything differently from WAPO on a booming economy, positive proposal for immigration reform, warm welcome in Davos, oh yeah tax cuts - bonus, wage increases and stocks from numerous companies to employers. WAPO hates America!

I think the proper way to think about FP is in terms flows, not stocks. Eg, FP could be viewed as the stock of debt after X years, or the deficit/surplus in anyone year.

5569 2018-01-26 02:35:32 My liberal CPA, normally a smart guy, divested himself from all his stocks believing that Trump was going to destroy the economy & bottom would fall out of stock mkt.
Being a koolaid drinking liberal is costing him tons of money. Expensive lesson, hopefully will wake him up.

5598 2018-01-26 02:14:36 The reason the suits against bars have been successful is because it's illegal to over serve patrons.

You won't see shops sued for selling legal bump stocks, just as you won't see car dealers sued to selling a car that kills a kid 3 years down the road.
5599 2018-01-26 02:13:25 Because tens of thousands don’t die from bump stocks. And when you take out suicides, gun related deaths per year are going down as the amount of guns goes up
5600 2018-01-26 02:11:07 TPP only cost me a couple limbs.. very fortunate wonder if infrastructure and higher stocks end it for me..
5601 2018-01-26 02:11:03 Nice GIF. Is it referring to your head?

There have already been successful suits against bars that over-serve. Where is the suit against the shop that sold bump-stocks and thousands of rounds to the Vegas shooter? Can't mass purchases of ammo be tracked?

5609 2018-01-26 02:04:14 I like $SYK...I liked it from back in the 90s...I don't have it in my portfolio because I decided to avoid stocks that went down 55% or more during the 2007-09 financial meltdown
5610 2018-01-26 02:04:09 @BOOMIEtrader isang malupit na sample naman po jan paano mag hunt ng stocks.. hehe
5611 2018-01-26 02:02:15 My dad keeps texting me pot penny stocks I feel like im receiving a constant stream of gibberish.
5612 2018-01-26 02:01:28 @POTUS Why use bothersome interest rate raises to slow stocks when you could use mini-tradewars and tariffs with China thieves and the like?
5613 2018-01-26 02:00:50 So comical how stocks/investors think bankrupt Donnie has a clue about finance...this is just all so bizarre.
5614 2018-01-26 02:00:02 There is only one side of the market and it is not the bull side or the bear side, but the right side. #forex #stocks
5615 2018-01-26 01:59:35 May your stocks go to the moon and never stop rising good sir!! Godspeed!!
5616 2018-01-26 01:59:28 Starbucks just announced another 500 in stocks per partner, paid sick leave, maternity leave and pay raises.... and they already pay for me to go to college  #tobeapartner #asu
5617 2018-01-26 01:59:02 Bump stocks? That's just the beginning. 
There is no justification whatsoever for war weapons in the hands of civilians.
5618 2018-01-26 01:57:30 I can also say 99% of penny stocks and anything people are glamorizing with their huge returns are strictly trades and not investments. Longterm losers as businesses can’t meet expectations set upon them. Millions of ex. in market but are ignored in an attempt to get rich quick.
5619 2018-01-26 01:55:11 I think he looks better on D this year, I thought BPM kind of overrated him in previous seasons as the only guy on Virginia who gets stocks but also gambles more than others. This year those gambles have been more calculated. At same time a 6'8 center, not elite athlete/length
5620 2018-01-26 01:54:59 Available Stocks For Clearance Sales. *While Stocks Last 
5621 2018-01-26 01:54:15 Agree, doesn't appear to make much sense. What makes it worth $17M ? First impression...Kinda seems like PR posturing with no substance.
5622 2018-01-26 01:53:00 First people need to get educated about guns. Bump stocks aren’t even a problem. You can make a gun do that with a regular stock. And you can legislate criminals. We can teach kids to learn to handle their emotions so they don’t go to guns when they get bullied.
5623 2018-01-26 01:52:36 GREER (Hearty Laugh) Plenty of time B4 the 2018 NFL Draft. Guys stocks will rise & drop no question. Let's move to Sports True or False!
5624 2018-01-26 01:51:39 Ok, but if he does he'll be the Herbert Hoover of our time.

Hoover was the 1st businessman elected president with no elected office experience.  He was sent to fix Washington and the stock market doubled.  When it became apparent he was going to lose to FDR, stocks crashed 94%.
5625 2018-01-26 01:50:45 Unfortunately there’s a big learning curve that comes with it. Especially picking individual stocks. “If you want to invest wisely, you constantly need to be fighting off your own worst impulses, we're not robots” we have emotions, and those emotions can really damage returns.
5626 2018-01-26 01:50:38 And for the record I own trx too lol I just get tired of seeing everyone put down coins. You don’t see people on Wall Street doing this about people’s stocks or portfolios. I don’t understand it on here. Everyone should want to do good and benefit from this.
5627 2018-01-26 01:50:08 I believe they teach that in tradtional stocks
5628 2018-01-26 01:49:45 Okay. I'd feel safer if our country could agree on some common sense gun laws. Like getting rid of bump stocks. Or holding people accountable for what happens to their guns. Carelessness is unacceptable when it comes to guns.
5629 2018-01-26 01:48:18 When income growth is near flat, stocks offer some of the best wealth creation around and regardless of income people should have skin in the game. #letyourmoneymakemoney
5630 2018-01-26 01:47:50 thinking ahead if these listed stocks will not be chosen as 3rd telco's, amazing to see the stampede selling..for now strike while the iron is hot
5631 2018-01-26 01:46:24 In 2018, do not get into:
- marijuana stocks
- bitcoin

5632 2018-01-26 01:45:44 Thanks for the like and the RT on the top 5 EPS #stocks @santiago0612 $EC a nice double from October. Have a super day.
5633 2018-01-26 01:45:20 i commented "you done goof'd" on yonghwa's stocks scandals post on reddit and got downwoted. Now he hurriedly enlisted after the uni admission scandal.

What's good??

I only feel bad for the rest of cnblue who're left without the main vocal
5634 2018-01-26 01:44:26 Learning about stocks is soooo interesting.
5635 2018-01-26 01:44:16 I mean shit if I’m CEO we not taking stocks down we pushing more of that shit on the shelves
5636 2018-01-26 01:44:15 Bump stocks prompted that answer??
5637 2018-01-26 01:44:07 We need to bring back the stocks.  It's only cruel and unusual punishment if you don't use it.  So the more we use punishments like the stocks the less unusual they become,
5638 2018-01-26 01:43:37 How did Boeing go up ? #stocks
5639 2018-01-26 01:43:11 All those foreign Central Bankers that created money out of thin air and bought US stocks are  their pants. Exchange rates are going to rip them just like what happened to Iceland in 2008. Can't wait to buy a Swiss chalet for a $1.
5640 2018-01-26 01:43:11 SOCIAL SOLIDARITY stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
5641 2018-01-26 01:42:42 $SPY Thinking we'll continue to get more mixed bag effect near term. Will continue to focus long on select stocks. Example $LX $LABU etc
5642 2018-01-26 01:42:41 how many middle income families & folks that less are getting rich off stocks & bonds? How many will really get a tax break after the midterm election & the bill reverts?
5643 2018-01-26 01:42:28 Good Lord people. Quit complaining, more (better) trading! Oh manipulation this, weird tape action that. Shut up and make money! #daytrading #trade #stocks #longs #shorts #money #stockmarket #nasdaq #btc #bitcoin #Ripple #tron #xrp #trx
5644 2018-01-26 01:42:25 Yeah..Like Sugar stocks..Most of them hitting lows
5645 2018-01-26 01:42:00 "What's...the deal....with bump stocks?"
5646 2018-01-26 01:40:55 So it's like coin base but trades in stocks too?
5647 2018-01-26 01:40:41 Yeah I saw that and thought how unlucky #GVC holders are with such a 'Black Swan' type thing. Totally unavoidable and a fact of life with Stocks.
5648 2018-01-26 01:40:25 Bump stocks then...
5649 2018-01-26 01:39:59 Welcome to GOP/NRA/Trump America.  But stocks are up, so aok.
5650 2018-01-26 01:38:46 Dont focus on the stocks  to buy which are making new highs - focus on the stocks which are making new lows and try to buy at good valuations just i added LUPIN. now one such stock is MCX on my radar
5651 2018-01-26 01:37:18 Same, for almost a decade now 

And of course if you have stocks, you're talking to traders & advisors on the regular & you know that Trump personally has very little to do with the great market he inherited ;)
5652 2018-01-26 01:36:11 The following Republicans voted against banning bump stocks, the device used in the #LasVegasShooting:

5661 2018-01-26 01:29:51 @StocksNJocks I really missed the 30% #TrumpBump in stocks. After listening to @MariaBartiromo @Varneyco this morning...I'm feeling a little sick about being out still.
5662 2018-01-26 01:29:03 I'm not familiar with stocks that trade on the TSX, unless they also trade on the NYSE or Nasdaq

5666 2018-01-26 01:26:22 They’re kinda like stocks but it’s a digital currency. But they work like stocks in a way
5667 2018-01-26 01:26:02 What shall not be infringed.  ?  A piece  if plastic?  Gun Owners don't need bump stocks.  They make rifles too dangerous.
5668 2018-01-26 01:25:55 I have a small portfolio of 5 stocks and four are from AAP. Dow is up 25%, I'm down 25% (GE & APA). Is the above valid for me?
5669 2018-01-26 01:25:33 @MistakeZss I agree fully with di away to avoid getting hit with WT, my friend does it all the time. But how does the string work into a up air off top for early stocks?
5670 2018-01-26 01:23:33 Perhaps, but the graph is saying that stocks had not historically (in the time graphed period) trailed the underlying commodity.

5672 2018-01-26 01:23:06 human Intellect and information is creating far more wealth than stocks of material resources, we are moving into a far more collaborating world.
5673 2018-01-26 01:22:27 The talk of $BTC has shifted to marijuana stocks. Don’t play yourself 
5674 2018-01-26 01:19:16 JC I agree on terms of trading you have to be long stocks. In terms of value investing though, there's not much of a margin of safety. Would you invest your $ long term at these levels? Looking parabolic higher this year.
5675 2018-01-26 01:18:45 I think it's self explanatory? Tiny pay. Sell stocks as income and fund operations. Also give Keith a call if you have more concerns. Don't listen to a guy on Twitter.
5676 2018-01-26 01:18:38 Could be a magical February, man. We'll see. No news would mean buzz kill, but I suspect they're smart enough to get news out before the conference.
5677 2018-01-26 01:17:49 There 2 sides an opportunity to buy undervalued stocks if you pick and choose carefully but some nervous sells as well. But also a reminder how easily the market swings from publicity.
5678 2018-01-26 01:17:39 And I can answer that with one recent shooting: The shooting victims of Las Vegas. I'm surprised u would actually have 2 have some1 answer that. U know where 1 guy mowed down 100s cause of military-grade weapons and bump stocks.
5679 2018-01-26 01:16:32 Just stop. This dog don't hunt. People will find out in very next check the truth. A mere pittance vs the 100,000s for the wealthy. See Wells Fargo: banks huge benefits but they are buying back stocks and closing 100s branches. Stop lying
5680 2018-01-26 01:16:24 I bought some stocks, now what?
5681 2018-01-26 01:16:09 Won't short any stocks, only currencies and commodities. Looking for a possible short position in crude and gold tomorrow or next week.
5682 2018-01-26 01:16:05 All the DACA People will have to register for pathway, then we find out who really gets to stay. Criminal record- you’re out. They rest are already more assimilated than others. Not a total win but it’s a start we get a wall no visa lottery and limited chain migration
5683 2018-01-26 01:15:03 That seems to be the sanest way to trade stocks
5684 2018-01-26 01:14:26 You don’t lose money in stocks, real estate or bitcoin until you sell. Buy and hold...Real estate is an investment! 
5685 2018-01-26 01:14:19 Aww yeah, I got nervous a few months ago cuz he sold his own stocks to fund the XFL
5686 2018-01-26 01:14:00 Wow typical crazy lefties with their stories on “scary” stocks. You guys are a laughable. Try actually standing for something the American people need. Try liberty.
5687 2018-01-26 01:13:49 Noticing a lot of stocks breaking down after blowout earnings (e.g. FFIV, CAT, WBGO) others doing well e.g. NFLX, LOGI. The market is still a raging bull but is beginning to pay attention to valuations. Calculated risk and tighter stops warranted.
5688 2018-01-26 01:13:43 Mutual Funds Weekly: Veteran investors say cash is trash as momentum rockets stocks
5689 2018-01-26 01:13:32 No it’s never too late but nobody will make that kinda money from those specific stocks or any of the big ones like that unless you’re already putting up hundreds of thousands of dollars.
5690 2018-01-26 01:13:22 @timseymour Suggest you brush up on how foreign exchange markets work. Dollar weak because world in great shape & investors don’t need go to dollar for safety. Forex 101.  Politicians can move forex but Trump can move stocks.
5691 2018-01-26 01:13:03 Hi I'm zane cupp and the only way to fill the void in my life is by making minuscule amounts of money on shitty stocks
5692 2018-01-26 01:12:58 1) you're going 8 digits with crypto but can't do any for stocks?
2) will your BTC/LTC wallets have segwit?
5693 2018-01-26 01:12:21 And it's a LOT more than the lousy $40 Obama gave us in around 2011. So yes, it's wonderful! So are the raises, stocks, job creation, investments in US economy that are happening/coming.
5694 2018-01-26 01:11:35 For all those wondering I use Alamy to upload my images as Stocks. They're very strict and view each of your images at 100% to check for any blemishes or inconsistencies. If they find any, you are denied and your account has to restart, even if you have 6 images already on sale.
5695 2018-01-26 01:11:01 Of course, most people who think they can beat the market don't have any kind of special or even interesting info. They just have vague hunches and good feelings, or nonsensical systems. Then they do OK, because most stocks go up. And they rationalize the losses.
5696 2018-01-26 01:10:24 Yet the Dems shutdown for illegals  which cancelled chip for 3 days
5697 2018-01-26 01:09:18 For the record, the NRA came out against bump stocks almost immediately after the shooting. The NRA never supported the proliferation of bump stocks. It was during the Obama administration that bump stocks were made available to Americans.
5698 2018-01-26 01:06:08 So @RobinhoodApp has gone krypto. Stocks and Coins in one app I’m shook

5706 2018-01-26 01:02:41 Long live sandbox! They had an affiliate or something similar on a different site where you bought stocks on players in most sports and depending on their play their price changed. Was pretty fun back then.
5707 2018-01-26 01:01:27 gotta find the best Canadian weed stocks before they go league
5708 2018-01-26 01:00:36 Whatever works best in the current market environment.. shortselling in a bear market you would have beret odds of stocks not being able to bounce as much and I go long in overall bull markets because the stocks can bounce more and easier.. I go both ways haha
5709 2018-01-26 00:59:28 I wonder if @TomHolland1996 stocks our social media profiles to see what’s up.
5710 2018-01-26 00:58:06 The trading volume of Bitcoin is more than %70 of the stocks in the stock market. And if you look down the thread, I shared an article that outlines the unfair advantage of HFT's and how they are legal but are market manipulators.

5713 2018-01-26 00:56:41 Yep. They make money on interest from your uninvested cash in the brokerage account (you can buy only whole stocks and they don’t automatically reinvest dividends). Also I think they sell trading data, and there are day-trading limits on volatile stocks. But they’re 100% legit.

5728 2018-01-26 00:43:20 I'm utterly convinced selling too early is my biggest mistake by far. Now when I really get a strong urge I just TopChop so I'm still in the game. Stocks with momentum often go further than we expect.

5739 2018-01-26 00:34:54 Jim Cramer breaks down why owning fewer stocks can help make you more money and why you should always have some cash.
5740 2018-01-26 00:34:43 It's not about bump stocks. If we let the government take them away they'll keep going until we can't own guns at all.
5741 2018-01-26 00:34:33 New level of toughness 4 da stocks
5742 2018-01-26 00:34:26 Precisely which stocks to buy
5743 2018-01-26 00:34:14 its 2018 and stocks still going up.

5745 2018-01-26 00:33:28 Might be time to start investing in stocks
5746 2018-01-26 00:32:59 The left is obsessed with #Russians and #FelixSater while the markets continue to perform at historical highs, stocks go up, and the economy is on a roll. The clear message to the left is: Who the fuck cares?! Trump is doing what he said he would! #MAGA
5747 2018-01-26 00:30:25 Anyone in Montreal stocks @seeedstudio parts ? Looking for a Grove - LCD RGB Backlight unit. Ideally over the week-end.

5748 2018-01-26 00:29:54 While Growth stocks still have momentum this will move up. But once we see that shift to Value stocks. These companies with no earnings will reverse course. IMO.
5749 2018-01-26 00:28:09 How bout... oh I don't know, maybe banning bump stocks and no CCR
5750 2018-01-26 00:27:23 Too much risk in $SX for me. I can understand the value that the stocks have that I currently own, and I have a good sense of where they are going long term. With $SX I don't have enough faith in the management team to execute. Also great technology gets passed over all the time.
5751 2018-01-26 00:25:49 Market V: @IntuitiveSurg off nearly 3% after hours, but overall rally looks intact. Even at 437, it's still above a recent breakout at 405.15, flat base. Q4 earnings up 25%, a good beat; rev +18%, matches Q3 gain. Net margin up 140 bp to 33.4% #stocks #investing #medical $ISRG
5752 2018-01-26 00:25:43 Really proud of my bros. We in the group chat talking about stocks and credit. We used to roast everybody all day long
5753 2018-01-26 00:25:42 Stocks up on soup, jello and pudding and crawls across the ceiling with them attached to my back as I out skitter the bone graft gods.
5754 2018-01-26 00:25:07 2 days from now pinanood ko yung vid ni annacay about belo tinted sunscreen and naghanap ako kahapon gosh out of stocks na nga 
5755 2018-01-26 00:25:04 If you're playing DDD sealing stocks is more so on DDD than it is you. Have to rely on Dsmash at the ledge too much
5756 2018-01-26 00:24:44 Better sell of your stocks in bioware if you have any.
5757 2018-01-26 00:24:25 Only 5 select states for now and not until February. Otherwise it will work the same as for stocks.
5758 2018-01-26 00:24:04 no....trump is not in hedgefunds money mamagement or stocks....soros is
5759 2018-01-26 00:23:56 I’ll also check out NDVA. My average is fine for namaste just seems like the company is catching up to the stocks current price. I know in a few months it will probably double over again but until then I guess I’ll have to just be patient....
5760 2018-01-26 00:22:38 What's up..... with not
splitting stocks anymore?
5761 2018-01-26 00:20:45 Stormy Daniels Stocks to a nose Dive with her tricks once they found out She Slept with Dementia Don they want a Discount !!
5762 2018-01-26 00:19:41 @MrBaileyM  so unfortunately Oakland airport only stocks Oakland postcards 

You'll have to visit for yourself
5763 2018-01-26 00:19:27 Well that escalated quickly... From owning a few shares of AMD to margin trading $2k in 3 days #stocks #helpme #pray4me
5764 2018-01-26 00:19:26 Great I also picked up a few more sub penny stocks I've done my DD on a few so I should be fine.
5765 2018-01-26 00:18:45 @Ford get your heads way out of the sand . and show a Chevy a Nissan  BOX FULL OF RUST OUT IN 2 YEARS , AND THE Ford box has no rust . HELLO ANY ONE HOME AT FORD TRUCK ??? MY STOCKS ARE NOT DOING GOOD , DO I HAVE TO COME DOWN TO THE GALSS HOUSE AND FIRER YOU ??
5766 2018-01-26 00:18:36 Everyday smokes   like car stocks .
5767 2018-01-26 00:16:47 I very much believe so, although still soon to say. In the meanwhile playing around with options in commodity stocks and ETFs

5770 2018-01-26 00:15:47 どう転んでもモンハンはいつかやり始めるので精神が安定している
5771 2018-01-26 00:15:38 I picked up $HAON today I hopfully I didn't miss much I usually don't trade sub penny stocks.
5772 2018-01-26 00:14:40 Me too. In fact I am very overweighted commodity related stocks and ETFs at the moment. 
Today's market outlook resembles to the 70'a when inflation skyrocketed. Terrible time for bonds and equities alike, great time for commodities.

5774 2018-01-26 00:13:42 Are you speaking of my mind today? 

Every time I scale something out, feel more relaxed and get better results.

I focus on a selected group of stocks and ETFs, study the charts... which make both life and trading easier. 
5775 2018-01-26 00:12:21 Trumps always selling & promoting the idea that arising stock market somehow helps all Americans but the reality is that the stock market is forward looking & most Americans still don’t have enough of an investment in the market to actually benefit from the growth in stocks!
5776 2018-01-26 00:12:20 Anyone who thinks if Hillary would have won stocks would be up like this or businesses coming back is living in dreamland
5777 2018-01-26 00:11:48 Any news on the bullpup stocks?
5778 2018-01-26 00:11:26 100% agreed. I own a lot of commodity stocks.
5779 2018-01-26 00:11:20 I really wanna get into investing in stocks!!
5780 2018-01-26 00:10:31 I don't buy into scams and made-up Monopoly money. I trade and invest in real companies and assets and make a good living doing so. Yeah, I know, someone you know made 1400% on bitcoin, some also made that much on penny stocks, but both are scams and highly speculative.

5782 2018-01-26 00:08:37 This is not to say that Jr steamrolls Falco, as I once thought.

Falco has viable options in this matchup, and can take stocks devastatingly early with rage and well-placed bairs.

He can juggle Jr fairly well with upairs

He can also stuff kart approaches if he's smart about it.
5783 2018-01-26 00:07:45 It’s healthy to not get carried away in the unrealistic gains of the crypto world and balance stability in another real of sustainable growth like stocks, business ventures, etc
5784 2018-01-26 00:07:08 Your stocks are worth more dollars. But your dollars are worth much less.
5785 2018-01-26 00:06:47 He was betting against the US economy. He though Hillary would win and he thought the market would weaken because of it. That’s why he lost a billion while everyone else made money in stocks. What a sicko.
5786 2018-01-26 00:05:08 People won't know what hit them when a recession hits, but that's a big, big, big opportunity to pry stocks away from the nervous handed skeptics that never make money.

5787 2018-01-26 00:04:45 A big Thank you to you that I got introduced to this stock at a level of 34.
5788 2018-01-26 00:04:19 I have the mobile app for stocks and don’t get ads. They offer higher tiered paid memberships w exclusive benefits like more $ instantly available upon deposit.
5789 2018-01-26 00:04:08 Well. I went to Sephora for the first time yesterday and fuck that. Apart from the fact that the Aus version stocks all of about 2 cruelty-free brands, I was horrified to see ppl putting the testers straight on their face/lips. Gross. Gross. GROSS. #HerpesYall #YouProbablyHaveIt
5790 2018-01-26 00:03:17 Weekend plans with my BFF @EmilyPiver State, we’re coming for you
5791 2018-01-26 00:03:04 I would assume the #Nikkei 225 Stocks would positively benefit from this currency manipulation today... (Considering #Yen $JPY was artificially pushed down... also BOJ minutes will be released from the 12/20-12/21 meeting) $NKD_F
5792 2018-01-26 00:01:24 @POTUS Then do something to assuage the American people...  like closing gun show loopholes and banning bump stocks.
5793 2018-01-26 00:00:39 Make sure you know the price you paid for any stocks or funds you have sold. If you don’t, call your broker before you start to prepare your tax return. #taxtip
5794 2018-01-26 00:00:34 Right now, only a handful of stocks are keeping the rally going. If the the number of unemployed starts to go up, the market could collapse.  The stock market base support is very small.
5795 2018-01-26 00:00:27 follow up on $ADVM, i've seen these biofarm stocks SKYROCKET & tank for no reason over and over for years - so much that i've stayed away from trading. but after seeing this pattern over and over, i'm shorting them. maybe one day they'll pan out, but short term - i'm short.
5796 2018-01-26 00:00:06 Biggest concern about crypto investing from my part is that the youngsters with no stock experience are going to pour their money into cryptos make some money. And later  have an unhealthy view on expected return from stocks and other things.
