13 2018-11-19 22:59:33 Hey President. We need to be working on getting China back to buying our commodities cause every time the market makes a run the mention of additional tariffs causes the market to fall. The average American farmers are hurting!!
14 2018-11-19 22:52:33 Nossa economia ainda é muito fechada, e já fomos a quinta maior economia do mundo. Pena que não soubemos aproveitar a onda de crescimento de 2004 com o boom das commodities. Crescemos, mas crescemos abaixo da média da América Latina e abaixo da média mundial.
15 2018-11-19 22:52:24 Yet CB's stopped buying USTs over 4 yrs ago.  China holds 26% of GDP in FX rsvs, US just 0.6%.  As other nations can print domestic currency for critical imports (for China & EU, primarily commodities), then FX rsv needs fall precipitously over time.

37 2018-11-19 22:42:46 Commodities have traded under production cost before. When hash rates drop the difficulty will decrease, lowering the cost of production.

39 2018-11-19 22:35:24 We have enough wind in Iowa to power the country. Ethanol is nonsense that doesn’t pay in the end but farmers are indeed hell bent on keeping it. It’s why they’re losing money, they refuse to understand. Presale of commodities works and gives profit but, old minds don’t change.
40 2018-11-19 22:27:22 Its almost as if your class isn’t determined by what commodities you purchase but your relationship to the means of production that produce sais commodities. Mind blowing I know.
41 2018-11-19 22:23:03 I mean ofc it would disappear under full communism because there wouldn't be work or commodities so it's a pointless thing to say.
42 2018-11-19 22:18:06 For the sake of all Americans let's just hope he knows what he's doing. There's a LOT at stake here and as a member of a Global economy, our foreign customers have many options beyond the US for their commodities.
43 2018-11-19 22:14:17 Retail store that sell basic commodities continue to make money because the need for basic commodities is still there... babies still need diapers moms still need to get milk, people forget to buy things. If a company didn’t make money on thanksgiving it would be closed. 
44 2018-11-19 22:14:17 What has been a thing? Lol compared to the other commodities, this one particularly had stronger impact then something like tabbaco or coffee. Yes fuck the system, (obviously) just crazy learning how evil these owners were coming from this specific commodity.
45 2018-11-19 22:11:00 Well, the good news for you is now there is no wait. 

But the larger point remains - phones are now commodities. They all do the same things with similar performance levels. There is no single feature that would drive a consumer from one phone to another.

49 2018-11-19 22:02:54 If there is a possibility to bypass the sanctions and sell the commodities , then find a way to import the medical needs as well. 
You’re detouring the sanctions with pride and honour; Why begging EU to set up a payment system then ?

51 2018-11-19 22:00:01 Zwirb: One of the problems with attempting to "shoehorn" spoofing into the wire fraud statute, as defendants argue, is that the elements of the wire fraud statute are far more exacting than the elements for commodities fraud. #Fraud #Spoofing
52 2018-11-19 21:50:16 Labs marketing to them and kickbacks making it worth it. Patients are commodities.
53 2018-11-19 21:46:01 >> look a lot more like securities than commodities, and smell strongly of scam (e.g. they worry about price manipulation in unregulated exchanges).  But the SEC is reluctant to classify cryptos as securities, because it then would have to >>
54 2018-11-19 21:43:55 First, that is not quite true.  The CFTF decided that they get to regulate crypto furures because, *for that purpose*, cryptos could be considered commodities.  The SEC has been dragging its feet on ETF and getting tougher on ICOs, precisely because it can see that they >>
55 2018-11-19 21:39:25 In multipolar system with onerous off balance sheet social obligations need a neutral reserve asset priced appropriately in commodity terms or else commodity wealth will stay in the ground.  That will require a big 1x reval of something apolitical v oil/commodities.

58 2018-11-19 21:28:40 Why Bank Of America Expects Stocks To Hit "Big Lows" In The Next Few Months
 
We are bearish stocks, bearish bonds, bullish commodities, bullish cash & bearish the US dollar. Our stock-bond-cash asset allocation heading into 2019 would be: 50% equities, 25% bonds, and 25% cash.
59 2018-11-19 21:27:30 The vigilantes are already here driving long rates down against the fed wanting to raise.  Credit bubbles, tariffs, low international rates, commodities imploding. Those are all deflationary, the fed is on the wrong side of the prevailing global slowdown. #inflation #Fed
60 2018-11-19 21:22:34 You also know that is pure subsidy and agriculture prices are showing downward trend. So we should buckle and become commodities supplier to the Chinese like a good colony at tax payers expense?
61 2018-11-19 21:18:27 There's a tendency of linking misfortunes to Chamisa by some politicians like @lilomatic and her frnds varakashi

62 2018-11-19 21:12:05 Commodity - a raw material a product that can be bought and sold. Trade - the action of buying and selling goods and services. Commodity market is a market where traders buy and sell commodities. If something has value people will trade it. Do you want BitcoinSV to be stable?
63 2018-11-19 21:09:22 Hope the next level isn't to double FX, fuel and price of commodities
64 2018-11-19 21:05:38 I get it, I grew up farming, but we are getting screwed by China on trade, agriculture markets have always had huge swings up and down, it will bounce back in other commodities.
65 2018-11-19 21:03:47 I'm not disagreeing with you. The way animals are treated like mere commodities is abhorrent & utterly heart breaking. Realistically, the purely animals rights rhetoric does nothing more than deter some people. It can also just reaffirm the vegans are sanctimonious cliché 
66 2018-11-19 21:03:36 You're pretty wrong. From corporate farming to food commodities, there is a terrible lack of competition. Apparently, you don't know.

69 2018-11-19 21:00:14 Whilst I love the content of the new Geography GCSE, the 4 mark questions on figures e.g. comparing the market price of two commodities, irritate me. So many students undone by a graph - yet they could explain Milankovitch cycles. Hmm...
70 2018-11-19 20:52:41 By the way. Would someone like to give me an Oxford English Dictionary definition of the term "'retail' politician". IfIt'sRetailThenPolitics'sAMarketableCommodity. The primary defining feature of all commodities is a lack of distinguishing features between individual units.
71 2018-11-19 20:51:11 The worst part of this aint the money; it’s the moral hazard and social anger that resulted. The wealthy were able to clean up in commodities, oil and gold. Govt did nothing to tax any of that. This and the austerity is a fucking disgrace: Brexit & Trump resulted
72 2018-11-19 20:49:06 O maior apoiador de Jair Bolsonaro no Congresso Nacional é a bancada ruralista, que representa os exportadores de grãos e carnes. O maior comprador destas commodities é a China, país considerado ditadura comunista clássica.

74 2018-11-19 20:48:06 Policies and laws should be public commodities, i.e arise from, debated and endorsed by the public as opposed coming/benefiting those few who are privileged ones and have access to the power elites. Also fair justice to all... in a nutshell Confidence building

83 2018-11-19 20:14:11 Yemen’s Ministry of Industry and Trade, in coordination with the Central Bank of #Yemen, reasserts its role and key regulations in the market, especially on food commodities, to better control the prices of goods and to blacklist merchants who are in noncompliance.
84 2018-11-19 20:13:45 Through Decree 75 for 2018, food commodity dealers will be able to meet essential goods through letters of credit and bank transfers to ensure the full flow of all imports of basic commodities to #Yemen to enhance food stocks and humanitarian conditions.
85 2018-11-19 20:09:11 There are two words that shouldn't be in our vocabulary when talking commodities - never and guarantee.
86 2018-11-19 20:05:02 In the end, China just needs commodities.  They don't care if they have $3.1T in USD's & a de minimus amt of gold or $3.1T in gold & a de minimus amt of USTs (on a real basis.)  They simply need cheap & plentiful commodities as a matter of nat sec.
87 2018-11-19 20:05:00 Commodities Update: NYMEX WTI Crude 56.76 (+0.30%), ICE Brent Crude 66.98 (+0.33%), NYMEX Natural Gas 4.633 (-8.45%). [delayed]
88 2018-11-19 20:01:07 So much to talk about. You people that don’t know how to run with the short sellers. Also saying commodities change price like the weather was a common sense statement.
89 2018-11-19 19:56:37 One of the most precious commodities we have is time.  Creating time through a better rhythm, or just making things simpler, is one of my favourite parts of what we do.  #releaseyourpotential
90 2018-11-19 19:53:06 Commodities nome a nome é bem difícil mesmo. Na média delas todas faz muito mais sentido. Na última década China puxou forte soft commodities/metais industriais. Começo do século passado o café era mais importante q petróleo. Antes disso tivemos metais preciosos, etc.
91 2018-11-19 19:50:40 .@weareiowa5news has new info on how many farmers have been getting paid from the farm bailout program....
-As of today, $1.128 billion has been paid to farmers
-Top 5 states – Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Indiana & Minnesota
-Top 5 commodities –Soybeans, Corn, Wheat, Dairy & Hogs
92 2018-11-19 19:45:21 Virtual commodities have a real world value of anywhere between $0.00 and $0.01.
93 2018-11-19 19:43:58 Se puede monetizar todos los commodities, los gringos no pueden porque no tiene nada, nosotros si muchos recursos que valen, no como el dólar que está respaldado por la confianza del plomo que te pueden echar cuando les da la gana
94 2018-11-19 19:35:42 The traditional role of petty smuggling in essential commodities by border community residents in ensuring local community resilience and national stability. A factor to consider.
95 2018-11-19 19:35:03 Maybe what africa needs are commodity backed tokens

Commodities that mean something in their real world

Like a chicken coop, or bale of maize/wheat flour or prepaid electricity

99 2018-11-19 19:06:51 PJ defaulteó deuda, licuó salarios públicos y jubilaciones (Kirchner las congeló varios años, son las q ahora está pagando Macri con la LRH) en medio de auge commodities secular. Pobreza en 2007 recuperó el nivel pre2001 y dejó de caer. 2007-2015: el peor gobierno de la historia.

102 2018-11-19 19:00:27 Help me out here. If the JA$, is gaining value, should prices on all goods, commodities ect, follow suit?.
103 2018-11-19 18:58:57 That’s really good to hear yr.. i hope they understand that they are only being used as commodities
104 2018-11-19 18:54:12 For me it isn’t about whether or not they use the players themselves so much as maintaining value in the system. If they’re entering the phase where they plan to acquire talent then guys like Stephens and Adams have value as commodities. 1/2
105 2018-11-19 18:51:52 Drugs make you a slave to capitalism and an enemy of the community sober up, get rid of these filthy commodities.
106 2018-11-19 18:51:15 And the change mantra characters have to make it worsen. Do you know the state of the economy in 2015 compared 2018 ;increament in debts incurred , dollar exchange rate gone beyond normal, price of commodities , fighting corruption one side , killings and the rest. Don't b fooled
107 2018-11-19 18:49:36 If CNY oil/commodities works, they will be fine.  If it does not, they will have the Current Acct Deficit-driven BoP crisis you are looking for.  This is why I am on record saying CNY oil has the potential to be a game changer.
108 2018-11-19 18:39:39 That’s very vague. Tariffs depend on commodities. Only a handful of currencies are convertible, hence the capital invested in them .
109 2018-11-19 18:36:09 China driving down the price of #Gold since April 11 via the weaker CNY in response to US tariffs. Does this mean that Gold is not going to explode higher at some point soon? Of course it doesn't. Same goes for all commodities.

112 2018-11-19 18:22:16 CB I think would be betteraddressed in free agency than the draft.  The 2 he mentioned are known commodities and would be an immediate upgrade and difference maker.

114 2018-11-19 18:15:54 The thought that keeps going through my mind is if commodities follow next like it did after 2000 and in 2008.  I’m biased long but ferts, uranium names, nat gas names have been resilient (oil/copper/gold/silver not so much but can argue they’re setting up for big moves)

116 2018-11-19 18:12:13 Especially since those endowments - especially if they move aggressively into commodities markets - can do things like drive up key food prices around the world. The rate of return on a $20bil endowment could easily become a kind of misery index.
117 2018-11-19 18:11:31 @FredMatiangi @InteriorKE @UKenyatta @JBoinnet @MOH_Kenya please do something about KEBS. This is the department that needs complete overhaul like yesterday.
Kenyans are dying slowly from toxic commodities and buying fake products because of them.
118 2018-11-19 18:09:31 Com certeza, nosso presidente @jairbolsonaro e nosso ministro @ernestofaraujo estarão atentos a isso, aquisição de terras por estrangeiros, exploração de nióbio como rejeito pela China e manipulação de preços internacionais de commodities em seu benefício.
119 2018-11-19 18:08:27 Wait until commodities break free from the collusive Fed/Treasury ESF sell bombing prices to suppress interest rates.
120 2018-11-19 18:04:13 Six months, use it for food commodities
121 2018-11-19 18:03:01 There is a HUGE fundamental difference between the US's massive current account deficit and China's. The US is rapidly *losing* its capacity to print USD for imports of finished goods, whereas China is rapidly *gaining* its capacity to print RMB for imported commodities.
122 2018-11-19 18:01:31 NOPE! Cindy=TRUMPIST= .@POTUS supporter. Is this REALLY kind of America we want? Leaders NON-CREDIBLE w LYING (WAPO), HATEFUL DIVIDING (NYT), CRUEL (sep'd families, #DACA, PR), USE PEOPLE as COMMODITIES - use & discard W/O COMPASSION, SEEKING WEALTH @ ANY COST even humanity,..
123 2018-11-19 18:00:02 Commodities: Natural gas +11.00%, Lumber +2.45%
124 2018-11-19 17:59:25 IMO commodities tem um componente imprevisível que quebra qq análise histórica: carros elétricos (transporte com eletricidade).

Ano que vem tem BMW, Volvo, Audi (desesperados), Porsche e os chineses.

E tem o choque do trade war, que desacelera China e compromete demanda.
125 2018-11-19 17:57:12 Contracumbres sin commodities por los aires no tienen el mismo color.
126 2018-11-19 17:55:32 You must have missed the federal courts decision on crypto currency being commodities. That’s ok I guess it was an “honest” mistake.
127 2018-11-19 17:53:05 Next person to tell me “you’re a princess at home” I swear I’m throwing hands. Y’all don’t even know the sacrifices all family members have made to get the little commodities we have today.
128 2018-11-19 17:49:24 I understand that dynamic; this is why CNY oil is such a big deal.  If they can print CNY for oil & other commodities, their current acct deficit "doesn't matter", just like the US, b/c China's non-commodity trade surplus = $700B.
129 2018-11-19 17:39:30 Aquecimento global antropogênico (AGA) é um engodo usado pelos globalistas, capitaneados por George Soros, para criar uma oligarquia de empresas de setores estratégicos  em nível mundial para obter total controle sobre preços de commodities. Criaram um gigantesco cartel mundial.

141 2018-11-19 16:39:53 I don't think we're at the point to be trading proven commodities for prospects, unless we're assuming a partial rebuild right now.  I guess Realmuto market was too hot.  Give me Ramos.  BRING ME THE BUFFALO.
142 2018-11-19 16:37:26 Is this setup applicable on commodities charts too? as there are too much speculative trade happens with high volatility...sometimes false breakout also displays on chart.. Please  guide

144 2018-11-19 16:27:37 Can I give you an example. You can not make GMB any better right now. The moment they start buying commodities at the world market prices people will start to import to Zambia etc for USDs so I don't think it's still worth keeping it under the government wings

I will like read your advice on the capital market especially on WTI and other commodities
153 2018-11-19 16:02:35 You don't track agri-commodities at all?
154 2018-11-19 16:02:10 Foreigners hold $11T in FX rsvs (sov debt) as their rsv "assets"; 2/3 of that is in USDs.  If USDs are no longer needed for commodities/imports (ie if more nations became monetarily sovereign), then it's a problem.  Monetary sovereignty = why global CB's buying gold/selling USTs.
155 2018-11-19 15:59:54 Good job on uncovering this!  am on background for Reuter’s and bberg in manipulation cases in past. As well as on the record on less sensitive stuff. Feel free to DM me on markets, mkt structure, options, commodities. Do not like how frauds are fleecing ppl
156 2018-11-19 15:58:48 Who is afraid to say it? Healthcare (other people’s labor, supplies, equipment, and facilities) is not a right. It’s a group of commodities. You have no right to other people or their stuff.

159 2018-11-19 15:47:38 I’m sorry you are going through this somewhere along the way people have become commodities and it is horrible that you have to suffer from a disease doctors know is treatable.  I hope you are comfortable and will be able to get your meds soon.
160 2018-11-19 15:39:09 To clarify, you’d like to plant groundnuts (producer)?
Prices of export commodities are very volatile, we’ll get back shortly.

Trade is dependent on demand. Do you need a particular commodity?
161 2018-11-19 15:38:34 I am not big on subsidies, however it is keeping the commodities markets stable. These subsidies are normally the delight of Democrats, however the RESIST! movement means anything he does needs to be shot down.
162 2018-11-19 15:30:34 Trump has decreased our wealth.  The deficit is an all time high, the debt is at an all time high, the stock market is down, gas prices are higher, wages are low, his tariffs are making numerous commodities more expensive.  I can go on.
163 2018-11-19 15:28:21 Por tal razón si abrimos las casas de cambio en todos los municipios, y más casas de cambio en la frontera y hacemos competitiva la tasa de cambio muchos van a venir a cambiar en Venezuela y no en Colombia, tenemos gracias a nuestros commodities, y anclado al Petro mucha ventaja
164 2018-11-19 15:28:00 Quite, although I fear sanity and deliverability are precious and rare commodities in these times.
165 2018-11-19 15:24:00 I teach people how to trade digital commodities like bitcoin & make over 20-50% monthly on their own
166 2018-11-19 15:20:36 Better argument for this in true commodities, like agriculture and insurance.
167 2018-11-19 15:19:39 Monetize which part? One thing capitalist hyperrealists miss is that the very field upon which the great God Capital operates has changed. Capitalism hasn’t advanced far enough to not rely on both labor and mass consumption of useless commodities. Climate chaos changes everything
168 2018-11-19 15:17:19 E num espaço de tempo tão curto. Em menos de 1 mês:
1) Anunciou transferência da embaixada do BR em Israel de Tel Aviv p Jerusalém, ameacando nossas importações de commodities por uma causa que não é nossa e cujo imbróglio estamos longe de entender
169 2018-11-19 15:13:56 In @_DigitalIndia it is very much possible to forecast realistic demand/shortage in the coming quarters for various kind of agri commodities so as to manage appropriate supply & pricing of the produce..will manage both inflation as well as farmer income well..
170 2018-11-19 15:12:43 Por ley el bcv debe proteger nuestra moneda de uso local que es el Bolívar, hacer funcionar el anclaje al Petro, tenemos commodities y pueden ser monetizados con tantos Petros necesitemos, vender el Petro solo en BsS en el mercado interno se debe revalorar nuestro Bolívar
171 2018-11-19 15:11:37 Commodities regularly enter extended bear markets:

- b/w 2014 & 2016 oil went from 107 to 26 (-75%). Price now 57.
- b/w 2008 & 2012 nat gas went from 13.7 to 1.9 (-86%). Price now 4.6.
- b/w 2011 & 2015 silver went from 50 to 13.5 (-73%). Price now 14.4.

Bitcoin is a commodity

178 2018-11-19 14:56:43 Será pura maluquice, para não dizer burrice, o petróleo é uma commodities, o preço varia de acordo com o mercado externo. A Dilma fez isso e quebrou a Petrobras! (Mais as roubalheiras, claro!) O que pode ser feito é criar um fundo para contrabalançar o sobe e desce do petróleo.

181 2018-11-19 14:40:20 So simple: watch the applications you download. Most of them hold spyware. Nothing is really for free and we are not protected by our governments. We are commodities and traded off between politicians and businesspeople.

186 2018-11-19 14:30:55 A budget deficit is not a big problem. It only becomes a problem only if we are importing more of non productive commodities. If our deficit goes on to purchasing of raw materials because we hardly have none in Zimbabwe, the deficit will be an advantage.
187 2018-11-19 14:23:15 once they start the online Shopping nobody is going to buy any kind of merchandise from the so called traditional ethiopian 'souqs' as alibaba will offer varieties in the commodities and not to mention the delivery service

198 2018-11-19 13:43:14 O mundo atrás de commodities e o Brasil querendo vender as suas reservas a preço de banana para, segundo eles, pagar uma dívida que eles nem mesmo sabe nós explicar.. Se for igual a privatização do sistema Telebrás, nunca saberemos pra onde vai o dinheiro
199 2018-11-19 13:39:53 @atiku The work to reduce the price of basic commodities starts now. I have ideas in that regard. I need an audience sir.
200 2018-11-19 13:23:49 I would argue that post-2008 they have been engaged on the biggest arbitrage in world history: It became obvious that all obligations would be printed, which meant the future price of commodities/finite assets was wildly undervalued & fixed rate debt overvalued...
201 2018-11-19 13:21:59 Because I believe I make better decisions with my money than the government would (when buying certain commodities and services). Make sense?
202 2018-11-19 13:19:21 Nope.  Stocks bonds and commodities are better.  Stocks are down 40% since 1989 in Japan.  That’s a 27 year runway

209 2018-11-19 12:53:42 Definitely not a party who patronises men looking at their sisters, mothers and unknown women in their age group as ‘hottest’ commodities in all possible ways. 
210 2018-11-19 12:49:48 Fair to say commodities are another category, characterised by their value converging on their marginal cost of production/extraction. Note: to the extent cryptoassets circulate as a kind of money inside their protocol (like ETH), they are subject to MV=PQ and velocity problem

215 2018-11-19 12:16:53 Burning and destroying would make them more valuable in the market because they become more rare. I think that's a bad idea! Government must impose strict ban on import/export of such commodities and exile poachers but i hope they get a death sentence. It's time we act now!

229 2018-11-19 11:53:34 Concentration camp prisoners were commodities to be used/sold for all sorts of purposes. European and American corporations used them.
230 2018-11-19 11:27:12 Ca and Au are the only good commodities exporting countries with a rule of law still working, the currencies will get stronger against USD no doubt in the commodity mega cycle, no other option, USA wants a weak dollar
You will not see that happening with Brazilian Real however.
231 2018-11-19 11:25:43 Being poor is more expensive IN Nigeria than any other country. You can't afford quality and equally more expensive things, so you'll die by cheaper, fake and substandard commodities approved by our sleeping NAFDAC and it's useless sister agencies.
232 2018-11-19 11:21:37 Be kind enough and tell how much all those commodities were sold before 1999? 
Pot always calling kettle black.
233 2018-11-19 11:13:15 Tell us the prices of the aforementioned commodities when the PDP took over in 1999... Do you think, we were all born in this indomie generation? Fuel was #20 but PDP left it at #87, rice was #1700 PDP left it at 10k, Dollar was #88-90 bt they left it at #230

241 2018-11-19 10:44:02 Nationalise everything in sight and then some. This rotten poverty causing, community destroying capitalist system needs to be confronted head on. It is getting to the point where virtually all services used by the public are private run. Makes them commodities that rob us.
242 2018-11-19 10:38:43 Here's the big problem. Commodities have got hyper asset classed. And so much investment money is coming in. Actual physical settlements of all contracts could kill some of the volatility. But even so option seller will always have huge risks. Especially the call option sellers.

247 2018-11-19 10:27:06 Or how about getting a better price for the commodities we sell. Not sure who to blame, CAP, Supermarkets or the consumer. Year on year price reductions leaves us more dependant on subsidy. While the processors and supermarkets keep their profit margin.
248 2018-11-19 10:25:44 Wow! Can you equally share the prices of the aforementioned commodities when the PDP took over in 1999? I think it will balance the equation and make your submission more reasonable.

273 2018-11-19 09:13:54 Celebrities and commodities alike have a built in obscelence which creates a demand for new products. Today we are so focused on these images of fame bc it is the image of them that sells them #cm203

276 2018-11-19 09:09:37 celebrities serve as commodities because they are only useful for their act #cm203
277 2018-11-19 09:08:50 celebrities are like commodities because we pay money to see them and after they have completed their "act", they no longer care about how they apperar to the public  #cm203

286 2018-11-19 08:23:20 I request all people to report this tweet and protest intensely . If people dont speak up at the right time it will become the norm. They will continue targeting commodities separately and firing from the shoulders of gullible people like jack.

288 2018-11-19 08:17:40 Moving around paper in any trade lifecycle is a multi billion dollar cost in a lot of industries. My guess is that just as blockchain has made zero impact in syndicated loans over last 3 years, it will likely have similar impact in commodities trading.

291 2018-11-19 08:04:21 I bet it is there because its age. In the commodities market the age of a commodity is crucial for the historical movements factor
292 2018-11-19 07:52:22 I think the model should be customized for where they work and not any other factors.

Where they work matters because the price of commodities and inflation of that location can be used to determine what a living wage is.
