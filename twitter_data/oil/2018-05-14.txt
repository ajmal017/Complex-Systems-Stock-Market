5 2018-05-14 23:58:45 The EU supports the Palestinians, because they need the Arab oil and business deals with Iran and Iraq. Most of the money they give to Gaza  goes in war material, terror tunnels and in bank accts of the leadership. The people suffer at the hands of their own leaders.
6 2018-05-14 23:58:41 Why do you Kenney supporters like to blame her for job losses? It’s like you’re choosing to ignore the fact that the previous conservative government, over decades, led us to an economy so dependent on the oil price that 100,000 of jobs were lost when prices dropped.
7 2018-05-14 23:58:38 Or, I’ll pay someone to create a oil change delivery service app. Whichever one takes the least amount of involvement from myself would be great
8 2018-05-14 23:58:37 And castor oil lol that started my contractions but I wouldn’t do that til your closer to your due date though
9 2018-05-14 23:58:08 Can you get refunds on oil changes. 
10 2018-05-14 23:57:57 Provided there's no compromise on taste, personally I like to regulate my own sugar intake & don't like all the recent policing of products but i'm happy to read you're not using artificial sweeteners instead. Happy to try them. Sustainable palm oil needs to be a priority though!
11 2018-05-14 23:57:50 He has to get the money somewhere  and it’s not coming from oil and gas
12 2018-05-14 23:57:37 Funny thing... The more you spend on Homeless the more homeless people you have... Just ask SF.. They spend $100k per homeless person per year.. And what did they get... More homeless.. Its all spent on managing the homeless people.. Its like welfare for city employees.
13 2018-05-14 23:57:29 Not only am I oppose of most of tRump’s policies (deregulation on oil, coal sensitive environmental issues, cabinet choices eso education, NASA, SOS, SCOTUS...), MAGA, any policy from Obama’s admin  they r trying to remove. Over 2000 lies/deceits, collusion (1/2)

16 2018-05-14 23:57:08 I wonder if volatility lingers longer in some underlyings. Wondering if the $VIX hanging around at 17 DID NOT portend higher levels .. it was just slow dissipation. Maybe we are headed toward more 2017 action  .. it was just a slow descent, slower than you see in /CL (oil) .

39 2018-05-14 23:56:26 The other day my boyfriend gifted me with fish oil supplements and doans back pain patches and he got me a big tub of cottage cheese from Costco and I sat there feeling super loved and realized that I am pretty old and have a very low bar when it comes to presents.
40 2018-05-14 23:56:18 Right? How many people forget that he is a war criminal, but only know him as that nice old fellow who does oil paintings?

The memory of a ##$%^#$% gnat, I tell you!
41 2018-05-14 23:56:09 Know what would be handy? If y’all knew of a place where you could get oil and make your own gasoline. Too bad there aren’t any readily available supplies of such up there.

42 2018-05-14 23:55:54 I will pay someone a good amount of money to take my car to get an oil change while I’m at work

44 2018-05-14 23:55:01 Pass a 15/hr min wage... Increase prices therefore increasing Sales Tax... Lure people from across the country to jobs that don't exist because at 15/hr business had to cut back... Order book on Amazon "How to Kill Jobs while Increasing Homelessness." Solution - Headtax...
45 2018-05-14 23:54:38 @iamjohnoliver : John you didn't mention about USA sanctions against Venezuela which is the main reason of economic collapse. 
Oil price decline is also contributory.

52 2018-05-14 23:53:14 Henri eats better than I do most days. His dinner for this week has chicken thighs, carrots, peas, collards, raspberries, olive oil, and lentils.
53 2018-05-14 23:52:58 Dear Snake Oil Salesman, The Finance Minister is right you asking the wrong question because you do not understand basic cost economics. The government is simply using taxation to disincentive the use carbons by taxing the redirecting the proceeds. It is a simple arithmetic dude.
54 2018-05-14 23:52:41 i love putting on rosehip oil because it makes me feel like a fresh bowl of italian pasta mmmmm

57 2018-05-14 23:51:43 it’s a low carb-moderate protein-high fat diet, so sugars & carbs are limited (some people remove them altogether), but proteins like meats, seafood, and poultry cooked in fats like coconut oil & butter are great, and I’m working on a page dedicated to keto desserts. my favorite
58 2018-05-14 23:51:41 Thank you I always dip my brush with Gamsol oil (Gamblin brand) throughout the painting process!

60 2018-05-14 23:51:38 I guess a war in the Middle East is in our future. War monger Bolton and Trumpino will start one to deflect from this corrupt administration. Oh yeah, the baby tax cut will be eaten up by higher oil prices. Thanks Pat.
61 2018-05-14 23:51:33 Doing this oil treatment
62 2018-05-14 23:51:31 In the case of an oil spill due to error/negligence, the company would still be liable for cleanup/repirations, no? And gov't would still enforce that? Sounds like you agree that taxation and regulation are both necessary for human flourishing!

65 2018-05-14 23:51:01 More of a tone deaf administration. Putting oil on the fire, just because they can....
66 2018-05-14 23:51:00 Do any of you use bio oil for stretch marks? Does it work? Or is there anything any of you recommend for stretch marks? Send me your suggestions please 
67 2018-05-14 23:50:59 It's hilarious how painfully obvious it is that oil money funds news media when they slam @elonmusk and Tesla for stupid shit.
68 2018-05-14 23:50:23 Russia only supports lower pricing to drive US competition out of business.  But we were pumping so much oil that they were powerless to do anything about it.
69 2018-05-14 23:50:23 In the King Fahd stadium. Of the Americans are trying to get more oil
70 2018-05-14 23:50:20 Coco oil all we need. Use it to refresh ur mouth too

73 2018-05-14 23:50:01 Oil corps get subsidies, got a massive tax break from tRump making more $$ than ever, and now rip off consumers with higher prices just cuz they can (and they are greedy fucks)
74 2018-05-14 23:50:01 Amazon has already held up the big project they were building... And said they would cancel it if the tax passed.
75 2018-05-14 23:49:52 是呀

80 2018-05-14 23:49:21 Payt and I just lathered ourselves in coconut oil to lay in the sun and we were running through her house and both ate shit so hard just now 
81 2018-05-14 23:49:19 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。

83 2018-05-14 23:48:59 Only oil companies in OK leave when that happens. Starbucks and Amazon have a better gauge of civic responsibility

91 2018-05-14 23:48:14 Elon couldn’t agree more however ther is an agenda to this. Keep oil prices high as long as possible.
92 2018-05-14 23:47:55 When you say that shipping by rail is unsafe most people probably think about the oil that blew up the town back east. Had that been bitumen in those railway tankers there wouldn’t be dead people and if in pellet form a few vac trucks would have cleaned it up! Rivers @ Oceans

95 2018-05-14 23:47:29 I really took my sister to get an oil change and wash the car... I didn’t even do that when I drove this shit
96 2018-05-14 23:47:27 This is not true. Iran will continue to sell oil and will use the proceeds to make mischief in the middle-east. The Europeans will continue to do business with the Iranians. All you have done is isolate the USA.
97 2018-05-14 23:47:23 Lol I KNOW! Crazy, right?    So cooking them in coconut oil is the best way to go if I want to try them?
98 2018-05-14 23:47:21 But, those killings are paid for by #SaudiArabian & #PersianGulf #Arab states' money who work closely with #Zionist #Israel & US to keep middle east in a state of chaos. It all began when they discovered #Oil in that part of the world & the killing won't stop until it has run dry
99 2018-05-14 23:47:06 All oil is sold in our Petrodollar. The Russians control so little of the world economy. This world is controlled by global banking, not humans. Trump is their media distraction. Why do you think all we ever see on TV, 24/7 for the last three years is the Trump shitshow?

115 2018-05-14 23:44:47 It’s weird. When other countries act like Israel does, the US & UK bomb them, maybe invade, get a bit of the old regime change lark going down, you know, mix it up, see what happens. Yet not now... Does Israel not have oil? Or is it all just a fucked up money game? 
116 2018-05-14 23:44:47 what if oil me up scooby

119 2018-05-14 23:44:20 Got sweet almond oil (amongst others) to add to my hair oil mix. 
It's fragrance is delicious. 
So I tasted it. 
Yep. 
It's oil. 

It tastes like the fry that got forgotten in the frying pan. 

Deeefinetly oil....
120 2018-05-14 23:44:13 3 years or 10 years ago, Xamar sold 90% of our oil revenue to a foreign company. Just like they sold our seas to Kenya. Puntland can't depend on Xamar not to sell us out and therefore we will always be against centralization
121 2018-05-14 23:44:12 Yes, if it affects the price of oil in any way.

129 2018-05-14 23:43:33 Did you get the over heating oil taken care of?
130 2018-05-14 23:43:19 I got off the oil monkey precisely because of stuff like this, so I enjoy driving by gas stations and seeing the prices rise.

134 2018-05-14 23:43:05 OPEC claims higher gas prices on Nuclear a deal with IRAN, yet less than 2.8% of our oil comes from IRAN.
 Who’s BS-ing whom here.
135 2018-05-14 23:42:51 I love cooking plantains in coconut oil!
136 2018-05-14 23:42:51 They say oil & water don’t mix.
137 2018-05-14 23:42:46 I cook my own super supper..

139 2018-05-14 23:42:43 It's about time someone really stood up to them. Like I've said before I don't know a lot about what's really happening in the Middle East, but the sooner we have electric vehicles, the oil producing companies will lose their power & I'm a petrol head.
140 2018-05-14 23:42:31 But why?  Why are gas prices rising in a market absolutely glutted with oil?
141 2018-05-14 23:42:30 Got my oil changed
142 2018-05-14 23:42:25  nobody asked you this? "Aaaah so much of oil on our hand" un-healthy miss!!

144 2018-05-14 23:42:19 Smoking, a health menace, evidence was there, lobby lost. Large-scale oil extraction, a climate menace, evidence incontrovertible, the lobby is being challenged and losing ground. Israel is an illiberal demon state, menace to life and human rights, evidence clear,challenge lobby
145 2018-05-14 23:42:13 Yup then all SUV sales decline and people reach for electric cars. Republican administrations know they have 4 to 8 years to rape American taxpayers and to keep us dependent on oil.

        Diamonds on my teeth
Your shit look like foil
       Chris Brown said these hoes ain't loyal
None of these hoes got no morals
150 2018-05-14 23:41:29 Ok, got it. I see the stuff you wrote in ‘08 & ‘10. I’m finally beginning to understand. But why the 15/1 oil to gold ratio?
151 2018-05-14 23:41:26 Drillin for honey oil
152 2018-05-14 23:41:20 ‘Do you have WD-40?’

‘... I have olive oil.’
153 2018-05-14 23:41:05 You can make your own healthy nuggets at home using arrowroot and almond flour for breading (egg wash in between) then you can either bake them or cook them up in some coconut oil. So delicious!
154 2018-05-14 23:40:59 なんだかんだ関東がよいってのは人間関係やイベント関連があるからで、そこら辺がVRで解決されるならやはり地元がやりやすい
155 2018-05-14 23:40:57 Bill, why don’t do us a favour and eff off back to the states. You remember the states, where coal exports are at an all time high, oil production is at an all time high and where the dirtiest oil in N. America is produced in California
156 2018-05-14 23:40:30 あ！何かガスマスクつけた白い鳥がいるぞ！待てー！
157 2018-05-14 23:40:26 And the value of Gazprom has gone up, Russian oil more expensive now Iran is cut off. Putin gets the boost  he wanted. Job done, bribes repaid. Everybody go play golf. Nothing to see here..
158 2018-05-14 23:40:18 They do with oil prices high.  Which is where Trump came in. Otherwise, not so much.
159 2018-05-14 23:40:16 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
160 2018-05-14 23:40:03 Oil prices will rise so Putin can afford his war machine.
161 2018-05-14 23:39:58 Lots of vegetable oil
162 2018-05-14 23:39:58 Premier @marshall_steven says #SouthAustralia Roundtable will continue and state will continue to support oil and gas industry to grow economy. #APPEA2018
163 2018-05-14 23:39:58 Zimbabwe and clean elections are like oil and water.
164 2018-05-14 23:39:51 good thing I got my trusty pocket parachute in chase duck duke flicks the wrong switch
165 2018-05-14 23:39:42 It’s that oil girl lol i told you it works
166 2018-05-14 23:39:42 When we tried to make an oil exploration deal, Ethiopia wasn't involved and it was Xamar that purposefully soured the deal. Only to turn around and sell 90% of our prospective oil revenue to Soma Oil and Gas. It's easy to see where the problem lies in this 
167 2018-05-14 23:39:40 We have CBD oil!
168 2018-05-14 23:39:31 Starbucks, Amazon, and Boeing will be out of there in no time..
169 2018-05-14 23:39:18 The power of Russia when it comes to gold, oil, and control over the world economy is nothing but spit on the ground compared to the wealth global banking is accumulating, while people talk about politics. Global banking bought our country. We have no vote.
170 2018-05-14 23:38:59 French hysteria. Total, the French oil company, has large oil and gas holdings in Iran. Surely the French would not have paid huge bribes to maintain this ? Now the yearly cash hush fund from the US has stopped. We could well find out. Everything about this secret deal stinks.
171 2018-05-14 23:38:43 Brought the bitch to work today and got her some new oil in her life and my slicks are getting close to needing replaced
172 2018-05-14 23:38:41 Yeahhh that tends to happen when you invade a country, extract the oil, create a power vacuum that gets filled with murderous religious extremists and have an occupation that leads to 500k dead civilians. They tend to hate ya.
173 2018-05-14 23:38:28 What happens when Europe refuses to purchase oil in $ ?
174 2018-05-14 23:38:28 I was just changing the oil in my generator in flip flops. Also bad idea.

176 2018-05-14 23:38:22 @MaryBuchzeiger — you’re seriously whining that “your president” is making a mistake? No — YOU’RE the one who’s made the mistake being conned by this snake oil salesman. We New Yorkers have know about his narcissistic bloviating for decades. You get what your stupidity deserves.”
177 2018-05-14 23:38:06 I've been watching. One take away is no nostalgia for Eberle on Oil.
178 2018-05-14 23:38:02 To deny dire environmental threats to our nation as long as they possibly can, while raking in profit for big oil/business off the backs of vulnerable communities. The "protection" part is for their interests only, not the health of our citizens.
179 2018-05-14 23:37:57 They're not bigger than the US Government. Or the UN. Or the EU.

They couldn't begin to buy the free parables that Virtue Signaling Hollywood preaches in support of the AGW. Big Oil bad; SJWs good.

All hail AGW.
180 2018-05-14 23:37:38 なかーま
181 2018-05-14 23:37:28 Branding! The Trump name will NOT be forgotten.

*cough* unlike Osama, oroma Oromo, obena...whatever his name was
182 2018-05-14 23:37:25 I thought W A Criswell was as bad as you could get during his 1000 yr reign at the First Baptist Church in Dallas, but Jeffress as turned him to just another snake oil, tent show yeller of low report. Jeffress on the other hand, is certifiably bat-shit crazy.
183 2018-05-14 23:37:22 siempre leo "oil" y me acuerdo de aceite ayufa
184 2018-05-14 23:37:22 Fundamentalist Christians can never pass up an opportunity to start a horrible war, now can they?  BTW, we skyrocketing oil prices are good for Russia, we know who you take your orders from!
185 2018-05-14 23:36:42 I also bought black castor oil. The smell is ATROCIOUS but I deal with it because I want my hair to grow
186 2018-05-14 23:36:41 I put my coconut oil in my hair after like 3 months and it feels so much better already 
187 2018-05-14 23:36:31 おやしゅみありがと!
188 2018-05-14 23:36:07 He's a complete Oil Tanker !
189 2018-05-14 23:35:59 I had apples, banana, and a small amount of walnuts for breakfast. I had an all vegetable salad for lunch with only a tiny bit of olive oil. I had no snacks or coffee all day. In the last 30 minutes I ate two donuts and three mini cupcakes. I will try again tomorrow.
190 2018-05-14 23:35:53 Tea tree oil mixed w baby oil n spray liberally.
191 2018-05-14 23:35:49 “Don’t waste gas cause ima need the car in Wednesday.. you NEED to check the car oil” what.... my gas ? That I paid for ?  I don’t need to do shit  wtf you think this is ?
192 2018-05-14 23:35:41 Yes, because Canada importing oil from other countries will definitely insure my children’s future. Especially since they have such environmentally clean practices.
193 2018-05-14 23:35:33 Thank you! I was getting an oil change in my Prius at the local Toyota, browsed the showroom and saw this car. Fell in love, end of the week, car was in my driveway. It’s fully-loaded with accident prevention, backup cam, bluetooth, 7-speed CVT, just $20k 
194 2018-05-14 23:35:14 just cooked with coconut oil tonight!
195 2018-05-14 23:35:03 Peppermint oil on my scalp has got to be one of the top 10 most pleasing sensations I can think of. 
196 2018-05-14 23:34:47 I wonder if Bern has one of those dripping oil lamps, or maybe even one of those rotating fiber optic flowers in the little case
197 2018-05-14 23:34:34 And watch the companies run out of the state.
198 2018-05-14 23:34:30 @realDonaldTrump These MORONS in the Houston P.D. are crossing the line coming out flat out LYING about CBD oil and the people are getting sick of the garbage and totalitarianism they spew every day! BIG PHARMA PAWNS!
199 2018-05-14 23:34:24 Insider trading regulation is a myth. Fiat currencies are only accountable to the ones who control the monetary system, which btw are not democratically elected. You're right, USD is actual money and that why the federal reserve has to back it with gold and oil. All differences.
200 2018-05-14 23:34:18 does that include listening to tax payers and voters about not continuing to invest in Oil, let alone put a pipeline through the country?
201 2018-05-14 23:34:07 Hey, Amazon -- move to Tacoma.
202 2018-05-14 23:33:25 I admire you a lot.
I strongly believe in your leadership.
Can't wait Sir.... 2019 is here already. 
Going forward Your Excellency in the waiting... what are the measures you will deploy to curtail the cabals in the oil industry.
203 2018-05-14 23:33:10 Premier @marshall_steven tells #APPEA2018 delegates that #SouthAustralia support for oil and gas is reflected in dedicated govt department for mining and resources
204 2018-05-14 23:33:09 寒いのは着込めばいいけど、暑いのは服脱ぐのに限界があるから嫌だよぉぉぉ。

206 2018-05-14 23:33:05 We were able to replace her anti inflammatory (that could cause liver/kidney issues after long use) with the oil and had a lot better results with her limping as well.
207 2018-05-14 23:33:04 Company dinner meeting. All they talking about is oil and I’m like

209 2018-05-14 23:32:56 We support Cdn refineries that process Cdn #oil. But as @CanadianFuels would tell you, Canada produces more energy that we consume so naturally we export it - it's one of Canada's largest and most valuable export industries. A growing world needs more Cdn energy - so #BuildKM
210 2018-05-14 23:32:51 Poor wittle oil exec babies. They want us to pway nice wiff em.
211 2018-05-14 23:32:48 #Cooking tip....sauté veggies in coconut oil gave veggies a nice flavor  #yummy #nomnom
212 2018-05-14 23:32:45 Let me oil my scalp & go to bed.
213 2018-05-14 23:32:39 Big Oil. Brand recognition for clicks. Greed. Lack of integrity. Pick one.
214 2018-05-14 23:32:36 My hubbys old truck was a damn rodent magnet. Turns out 2004 chevys used a veggie oil based wire coating that was delicious when it aged.
215 2018-05-14 23:32:34 #QuierenCerrarC5N
Magnetto quiere C5N, Aranguren y Shell quieren Oil. Muchachos insaciables.
216 2018-05-14 23:32:27 Who knew, coconut oil is the worst.
217 2018-05-14 23:32:22 Bush was never a Democrat. Democrats are smarter than Republicans because they don’t want to start wars. Killing military over Oil is never a good idea to a Democrat but I guarantee trump will get service members killed because he has no idea what he’s doing. Mentally unfit. 
218 2018-05-14 23:32:15 The greatest sub is publ1x b0ars head ultimate with provolone.

220 2018-05-14 23:32:04 Why is trump getting Comission from a Russian Oil company?
221 2018-05-14 23:31:58 おいおいおいおい！
222 2018-05-14 23:31:43 So where is the problem, cut out blue states and let them figure out their energy sources, we will take the coal and oil for our use.
223 2018-05-14 23:31:36 Sunflower seed sama rice bran oil.. 2tetes masing masing...aku gitu sih, ga tau kalau doi -ns
224 2018-05-14 23:31:34 Yeah it getting up there. National avg right now is $2.87. It’ll be well pass $3 when the summer months come. Crazy because crude oil exports in the US have doubled in production, yet gas continue to rise.  Pulling out the Iran nuclear deal didn’t help either.
225 2018-05-14 23:31:34 And exactly what would you do to force process down? When oil companies decide they need a profit bump, they take it, what are you going to do about that?
226 2018-05-14 23:31:23 That's because it doesn't involve Muslims, "Terrorists", or oil.  If it's not a part of the big 3, America generally isn't interested.
227 2018-05-14 23:31:05 ...to hasten the apocalypse.Also,one of trump's goals is to start a war-somewhere.Iran ideal bc of trump's love of oil.A statement he made in 2016 regarding the Iraq War: "It's too bad. We shoulda' kept the oil,shoulda' kept the oil. Oh well,maybe we'll get another chance'.
228 2018-05-14 23:31:00 Part 1: Born in 81. I missed the glory days. Born in London went to school in Bedfordshire. It was full of United and Liverpool fans. Equal amount of Spurs and Arsenal can count on one hand Chelsea as no oil money then. At no point did those Liverpool fans care about spurs.
229 2018-05-14 23:30:57 I thought I was the only one feeling high anxiety over this shit show with #Thump, Nutandyahoo,China,Syria
Spiraling oil&gas and etc.,etc. 
The common goal is they must go!
He has sabotaged ACA,he's openly allowing predatory consumers protections to go away!His admin is shit!
230 2018-05-14 23:30:53 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
231 2018-05-14 23:30:52 Yup, this will be one of the "surprises" of 2018. E&Ps are saying cost inflation is under control, but it can't be as underinvested-in equipment and people are called to work. E&P margins will get pinched, but higher oil prices will still refloat the broader model back onside
232 2018-05-14 23:30:43 she doin my dreads butt naked w jamaican oil
233 2018-05-14 23:30:43 Roast green beans or Brussel sprouts at 425 for 15 min, then flip and another 10. I like using a lil olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder
234 2018-05-14 23:30:40 Tea Tree Oil from the body shop!!!
235 2018-05-14 23:30:39 #QuierenCerrarC5N?

En realidad no. 
Sólo que su CEO retuvo impuestos a los combustibles, quebró OIL y no dejó artículo del Código Penal por cometer.
Bastante que con mis impuestos "pagaba" los viajes de muchos a Miami -eso ahora se corta-, encima salvar con ellos a #C5N?
236 2018-05-14 23:30:37 Hey @elizabethforma please consider signing the @NoFossilMoney pledge. It is a crucial next step in the fight against big oil and we need your help to protect the climate! @SunriseBoston supports you and hopes you will work with us in this movement

247 2018-05-14 23:29:09 We just got some new *TRUE CO2 1/2 GRAM HEADBAND CANNABIS OIL DISTILLATE APPLICATOR*
248 2018-05-14 23:29:08 Got smashed in the oil field
249 2018-05-14 23:29:07 So are you saying the media should not be showing a pipeline squirting oil and the Supreme Court shouldn’t hear if the government has broken the law? We allready know that nobody can guarantee pipelines or trains. Oil companies even have too admit someone will die at work! Got it
250 2018-05-14 23:29:07 The people at the oil change place are always shocked that my car is a 2011. It’s funny bc it’s 7 years old but also pretty much brand new. 
251 2018-05-14 23:29:04 Snake oil salesmen ... both of them!
252 2018-05-14 23:28:42 No jokes, 9 billion Italians die each year to make olive oil 
253 2018-05-14 23:28:40 You're consulting for oil companies in Calgary, why are you pretending we don't know that?
254 2018-05-14 23:28:36 Check out the Qataris going up in Trump tower just before Russian oil deal. That's exactly what the dossier said had happened. Trump Org brokered a deal with Russia to gain 19.2% of the oil company.
255 2018-05-14 23:28:29 No difference between the two, except a mirrored image aka flipped.  Oil/No oil... no difference, no wilting, no color difference w the other (if they were steamed for example) in pics.

258 2018-05-14 23:28:15 @TommyAhlquist you contradict yourself when you say you want the people to be in charge instead of the governor or legislature but yet you want to keep marijuana out but CBD oil in. Most of America want marijuana legalized you dope. #tommyforhimself
259 2018-05-14 23:28:03 #TrumpLiar is waging war on the middle class. Oil billionaires cleaning up while the rest of us suffer.
260 2018-05-14 23:28:02 Trump is a Russian oil barron now. He has a big stake.
261 2018-05-14 23:27:55 Wow, I just tried my Mum’s Tata Harper cleansing oil and  game changer!
262 2018-05-14 23:27:50 ช่าย ช่าย ช่าย รักอยู่แล้ว ยิ่งรักมากขึ้นอีก 
263 2018-05-14 23:27:44 Proverbs 27:9 ESV - Oil and perfume make the heart glad, and the sweetness of a friend comes from his earnest counsel.
264 2018-05-14 23:27:27 I heard that because of this they aren’t moving forward with the thousands of planned hires though. Socialism doesn’t work.
265 2018-05-14 23:27:24 Ahh a delusion deplorable. Keep drinking the koolaid. You may as well, you already bought the snake oil.
266 2018-05-14 23:27:19 This vacation to Cali is going to oil up my gears. They be grinding lately,need to recharge

268 2018-05-14 23:27:04 Yes I have a friend whose mom didn’t want radiation treatment and used pure CDB oil and it alone shrunk her tumor by 80% from her first diagnosis
269 2018-05-14 23:27:00 “Let's stop fracking. Who knows about hydraulic fracking? I'm like, whodie, get that oil out the ocean”
- @LILBTHEBASEDGOD
270 2018-05-14 23:26:20 At least I don't have any petrulli oil
271 2018-05-14 23:26:15 I remember when oil came in quart cans and the funnel had an opener built in
272 2018-05-14 23:26:13 @hetero_hubris when you cook meat, do you drain the oil/grease thats in the pan or is that good for you?
273 2018-05-14 23:26:04 Are you okay? Middle East,  for what? I really don't know what do you think about people?  You think they are stupid?  You guys are here to Rabe OIL and you guys don't care about anything , ISIS and others are your house dogs
274 2018-05-14 23:26:03 I know Venezuela’s government with the world largest oil reserves is an unmitigated corrupt socialist disaster while Chile is a sane market led social democrat ( sort of socialist) success.
275 2018-05-14 23:25:37 There's no justification for his appointment. But oil money they care/ reason
276 2018-05-14 23:25:36 It could do with a just a hint of oil 
277 2018-05-14 23:25:28 “It’s like oil and water trying to blend and it’s not working” best thing my mom has said in awhile
278 2018-05-14 23:25:27 Oh wait, it’s because I decided to use straight baby oil on the beach for 3 hours. NOT A SMART MOVE!!
279 2018-05-14 23:25:27 The ride TO is more dangerous...shall the doc. start questioning your driving skills, how often you change the tires\oil, get a tune-up...?
280 2018-05-14 23:25:21 World prosperity is often measured as the number of people in poverty, average wages compared to living expenses, etc. 

And oil, combined with capitalism, has dragged literally billions of people in to wealth.
281 2018-05-14 23:25:08 " keep de oil, I working soil" 
282 2018-05-14 23:25:07 It may sound funny but make your own. Mix one tablespoon of olive oil and an egg yolk with a little of your regular conditioner and BOOM all you gone feel is softness when you wash it out

284 2018-05-14 23:25:03 "And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him." ~Luke 10:34 #Jesus #God #Bible
285 2018-05-14 23:24:52 My little sister pushed the button on my oil pen in front of me and my older sister and my response was: “stop you’re wasting it” and my older sister said “don’t push it cause then you’ll get high”

She said “smh you see the difference of parenting, she’s the good mom” 
286 2018-05-14 23:24:51 Kokatha elder Sue Haseldine, lobster fisherman Kyri Toumazos, and tourism operator Elise Lavers are among the community leaders sending a clear message to Big Oil today: @Statoilasa is not welcome in the Great Australian Bight.

289 2018-05-14 23:24:40 Hey @elizabethforma. Thanks for your work on #climate. Will you sign the @NoFossilMoney Pledge, reject campaign contributions from big oil and instead prioritize the health of our democracy and climate? Asking as a constituent.
290 2018-05-14 23:24:30 I'm an educated an peaceful young man. You ask me what's the capital of #Palestine, I will tell you Jerusalem(East). So what's the point of moving the U.S embassy on Palestinian territory if not to put oil in the fire?
291 2018-05-14 23:24:28 Lmao shit sucks girl. Use thieves oil. It'll help numb your gums around your teeth . That's how I survived
292 2018-05-14 23:24:27 @JamieHyland silver and gold prices are a little out of my wheelhouse, sorry. As far as commodities, oil is all I follow.
293 2018-05-14 23:24:26 Fuel price hiked just after Karnataka elections. It shows oil company and there product prices are influenced by the governments.
294 2018-05-14 23:24:16 He is happily throwing fuel on a middle Eastern fire.
But hey oil prices are rising, unprecedented demand for arms and ammunition all his friends are winners.

299 2018-05-14 23:23:38 There are always alternative treatments for cancer besides chemo. You can try eating raw vegan and taking supplements and using CBD oil and meditation/yoga and what not. You can go to healers. And i’m sure there’s much more you can try. Do whatever you want bby girl.
300 2018-05-14 23:23:33 This is what it's come to? You made a little pronoun mistake and you get jumped on and have to apologize ? 

Seriously, no wonder people fell for a snake oil salesman with a foul mouth and no idea of how things work. They just wanted this stuff to change.
301 2018-05-14 23:23:29 My guess is foreign oil money from someone he knew before..
302 2018-05-14 23:23:20 I hate when my mom uses my wild growth oil
303 2018-05-14 23:23:08 Bill Schuette has had the power to #shutdownline5 for nearly 8 yrs. A line 5 leak will destroy drinking water of millions, the tourist economy, and coat beaches in oil. Michiganders deserve a governor who puts their futures first. #ShamefulSchuette #ShadySchuette
304 2018-05-14 23:23:08  We know some of those policy makers currently frothing due the sound of the bell indicating an increase in the price of crude oil!
305 2018-05-14 23:22:53 Another point that I didn’t get into that much, is that as the price of oil rises, service companies start charging more so this also eats into profitability of oil producers.
306 2018-05-14 23:22:34 You'd think he could defend Clagary's oil producers without being so dang rude. I used to like this guy.

309 2018-05-14 23:22:06 I just use my wig, under the wig are the cornrows and I wash them about 3 times a week then spray coconut oil mixed with water. For my skin I use coconut oil with abit of e45 at night, also use the rooibos antioxidants range from clicks
310 2018-05-14 23:22:05 And one step further; the billions of oil and gas tax funded subsidies already going to Texas, need to be stopped & re-directed to Renewables. Just make the payments to Elon Musk and associated Corporations as example. Places like California are putting us to shame.
311 2018-05-14 23:22:04 I know!!! Coconut hair products smell so bad but they’re so good for your hair. The struggle is real . I try minimising the smell of coconut by using argan oil
312 2018-05-14 23:21:54 I use She Moisture: Jamaican Black Cator Oil, strengthen & restore leave-in conditioner.
313 2018-05-14 23:21:45 Well Bibi needs a war and Donny needs a war and Putin wants a war and China is salivating 
and then there's the oil
314 2018-05-14 23:21:45 i have two laughs and they sound like this;

1: that sound when you're using a sponge to clean a window, and it makes that squeaky sound
2: a creaking door you need to oil
315 2018-05-14 23:21:44 Whatever the current month is
316 2018-05-14 23:21:40 Trump gonna want to slow his fucking roll...we do give America crude oil for pennies on the barrel
317 2018-05-14 23:21:24 As far as the middle east is at war with eachother oil prices will rise and you know what that is

If you know you know.

321 2018-05-14 23:20:41 3) It will accelarate cost declines for hydrolysis, potentially critical for decarbonisation of industry. 4) Subject to hydrogen sourced from hydrolysis, it will reduce the power of oil and gas majors and increase risk of stranded assets. There are probably other benefits! 2/2
322 2018-05-14 23:20:40 Cool. I stopped bio oil, it started to break me out. My Holy grail is actually a gentle cleanser from Elf
323 2018-05-14 23:20:38 Great info!! CBD oil is helping SO many people.
324 2018-05-14 23:20:26 CBD oil is bae.

327 2018-05-14 23:19:42 Most are packed in oil, also - but I think I like the ones in salt water better. I’m going to look for those next time.

333 2018-05-14 23:18:16 On the point of selling oil to other countries oil is a fungible commodity and while he can create temporary disruptions it all levels out.

335 2018-05-14 23:18:01 Electrification and privatisation of Railways can make India reduce its oil imports bill in a big way.
336 2018-05-14 23:17:55 Cannabis plays an important role for me too. Used carefully as a microdosed oil it reduces inflammation and is neuro-protective. An infused topical oil made from high THC flowers used liberally is like a magic bullet for fibromyalgia and joint/bone pain. #pwme

343 2018-05-14 23:16:38 No lol it only uses a small of amount of oil I believe. I’ve never actually used one lol
344 2018-05-14 23:16:25 Do you realize how you come off? They are referred to as the Oil Sands. If you wish to live in the past so you can continue with your hypocrisy, fly at it. I am sure that you do not live a fossil fuel products free life.
345 2018-05-14 23:16:20 i had my summer tires put on the BMW yesterday. they totally fucked it up putting one 225 & one 255 in the front & on each the back. pretty pissed. I knew it wasn’t driving right almost immediately. I’ll take the free balance, alignment, and oil change - and then find a new shop.
346 2018-05-14 23:16:07 Me.

I need to find a way to keep them away so I just avoid the problem altogether. I wonder if peppermint oil really works?
347 2018-05-14 23:16:05 Had meatloaf, mash  potatos , and green beans (which were first boiled, then fried in garlic and  olive  oil with butter and pepper flakes for dinner
348 2018-05-14 23:16:04 Lmao, I will I will. I just don’t have any products at the moment. All I’m using is water, coconut oil & eco styler gel at the moment 
349 2018-05-14 23:15:58 Maybe Saudi Arabia, Qatar & the other rich oil nation's should take those Syrian refugees.  They are not doing their fair share
350 2018-05-14 23:15:51 What happened to the Zero Emission Mandate? CA backed off on a bill that would have us breathing clean air right now but the state government reneged on its promise and vowed to the car and oil companies.
351 2018-05-14 23:15:50 He also turned water into gun oil IIRC
352 2018-05-14 23:15:49 the hell is the difference between beard butter and beard oil? Do people use both?

355 2018-05-14 23:15:32 Mercers, Koch's, Murdoch, Hannity, Trump, the GOP, Xi, Putin and all of their friends. Assad, Duterte, maybe Kim is joining. They are privatizing our planet and destroying democracies around the world. Propaganda, oil, water, money laundering. These people are a disease.
356 2018-05-14 23:15:25 I better get that quick oil change alv.

361 2018-05-14 23:15:00 this tea tree oil is making my eye tear up
362 2018-05-14 23:14:38 My skin cleared up so much! God bless.
Just looks a little oily but like that healthy oil u know?
363 2018-05-14 23:14:34 That's exactly what I did!!! It worked so well until it came off. The squirrels tried so much that most of the oil came off on their greedy paws 
364 2018-05-14 23:14:29 Sure. Global daily oil production is about 95 million bpd and Canada is about 4.5 million of that.

367 2018-05-14 23:14:20 Yesterday, my daughter washed the dog, and several hours later my wife says “Weird, the dog is still wet!”

That evening I get in the shower and see a bottle of baby oil.

Believing it was baby shampoo, the daughter had anointed the dog in oil, instead of washing her.
368 2018-05-14 23:14:17 American cheese is literally lard, oil and butter Streach to a unbelievably consistency. If it’s wrapped in individual plastic it’s not real cheese 
369 2018-05-14 23:14:15 Story of my life: 

Cut my hair. Whine that I want long hair. Religiously take vitamins. Coat hair in oil once a month. Finally have long hair. Sees short hair cut. Chops hair off. Repeat.
370 2018-05-14 23:14:05 I've been outside with oil on for thirty minutes and I'm not charred to a crisp yet this is upsetting

trump ends Iran deal
Oil prices shoot up
making Rofsnet and Russian oil companies and Putin rich again. Follow the money  trump secretly owns shares in Rofsnet. Ending Iran deal was by Putin's orders
373 2018-05-14 23:13:38 My sister used a different oil sheen spray on her hair. ....her face broke out. ...
374 2018-05-14 23:13:37 Yeah, oil tankers still visit Hodeida and I originally had a ton of data on about those volumes but it got cut for space, though there are still overall figures for Q1 2018 (no fuel officially comes through Salif, so it is all Hodeida). Metrics from WFP, UNVIM, YCHO, ROYG, NGOs.
375 2018-05-14 23:13:32 Will it work with any other coconut oil? I penah try castor dulu. It lengthened a bit tapi masih ke arah bawah  give up betul haha
376 2018-05-14 23:13:09 The media just doesn't want electric cars to take off because half of what the news covers is gas and oil related crisis.

379 2018-05-14 23:13:01 Lmao it’s not a deep dryer ... the point is for it not to be soaked in oil
380 2018-05-14 23:12:57 Easy for Dudley to say that $50-65 works. The global OFS sector is barely profitable and not investing in equipment or younger people. Sorry Bob, the model is broken and only higher oil prices will fix it (incentivize risk-taking longer term by far more E&Ps)
381 2018-05-14 23:12:46 疲労がコンパイル。

383 2018-05-14 23:12:27 @Kia_Motors hello

i imported a vehicle from USA, a Kia Sorento 2.4lt GDI 4wd, 2012, and now the vehicle is presenting a oil pump and motor problem

i know you recall this vehicle for this problem, but right now the Sorento is here in Dominican Republic.
384 2018-05-14 23:11:56 Mike, if you use “oil sands” just once in a tweet I will like and retweet regardless of what it says.  That would be a win win for both.
385 2018-05-14 23:11:56 I’ve heard great things about Bio oil! Do you know where they sell it?
386 2018-05-14 23:11:41 So, was this a surprise visit from your mom or did you guys plan it...?   ;-P
387 2018-05-14 23:11:38 I’m for it, however, my concern is about scammers peddling their snake oil preying on terminally ill patients and their desperation.
388 2018-05-14 23:11:30 頑張って！！まずはお昼まで頑張って！おいしいもの！
389 2018-05-14 23:11:03 My day? I'm out of coconut oil! 
390 2018-05-14 23:10:52 My humble opinion: It ALL goes back to the Rosneft Oil deal. 19.00% with a tacked on .05% for the #TrumpCrimeFamily as profit brokers. No reason otherwise to engage Tillerson as SoS. 

Then the deal went sour as the Quataries did not bail out Jared's 666 property.   #TrumpRussia

394 2018-05-14 23:10:16 To the imbeciles who thought I was wrong about oil going up because of #PutinsBitch decision to violate Iran treaty

Biggest winner? Russia. Putin was going broke on low oil prices

Biggest losers? Americans who have to cut back and then watch ANOTHER Republican recession unfold
395 2018-05-14 23:10:14 My take is this...oil has been on a slow upward climb since 2015. Partly it is because of strength in the global economy pushing demand.
396 2018-05-14 23:10:00 Tuesday, 9P for my son, Ryan, whose invention was chosen from his class to be presented to the whole school for the "Invention Convention" on Wednesday morning. His invention is the Splatter En Guard which protects your hands from oil/grease splatter while cooking.

404 2018-05-14 23:07:56 Wow this is incredibly dangerous. They are selling snake oil.
405 2018-05-14 23:07:53 the pelicans BOUGHT VOTES to protect big oil and who wins? them who loses? those little green cops

407 2018-05-14 23:07:40 The study you referenced from 2007 included three boys ages 4, 7, and 10. All used lavender-scented soap and skin lotions, or shampoos or styling products that contained tea tree oil and lavender oil. After they stopped using the products gynecomastia had subsided or resolved.
408 2018-05-14 23:07:36 don’t talk to me about cars I don’t even know how to change the oil in one

411 2018-05-14 23:07:20 Is she a yinzer?
412 2018-05-14 23:06:29 Big Oil is scrambling to get out of Alberta. Rules , Regs and Tax. Not a good place to do business. It has nothing to do with renewables.
413 2018-05-14 23:06:00 There is no faster, easier and common sense way for Californians to reach our climate goal of 100% renewables than by solarizing #EveryNewHome built across our state. At the same time, we can need an #ExtractionTax like every other oil producing state and to #BanFracking!
414 2018-05-14 23:05:45 車掌さんの声がイケボ過ぎて笑った
415 2018-05-14 23:05:40 Well, it's an odd one, James...because one assumes the difference between normal and exceptional high prices go into the pockets of the oil companies
416 2018-05-14 23:05:39 Data = crude oil of varying density and sulfur content ?
417 2018-05-14 23:05:36 Exactly they showed the reality of big ships ferries, oil pipe lines, recycling plants. I rather play in the peat bogs.
418 2018-05-14 23:05:33 @ctvwinnipeg @CTVNews Our dollar and the cost of oil per barrel does not justify the price at the pumps.  Do your homework, report some real investigative journalism.
419 2018-05-14 23:05:32 Seriously, it always looks like Congress was ordered at gunpoint to spend unwisely and waste time.  We need ejection seat term limits.
420 2018-05-14 23:05:23 My car needs and oil check and brakes 
421 2018-05-14 23:05:18 @PaulLee85 Thats why he is leaving.A traitor to his party and to his constituents.He was in bed with oil guys and Soros.Not all republicans are good.The swamp is thick with thieves.The whole FBI DOJ OBAMA CLINTON BIG OIL BIG PHARMA To them people are only a vote.
422 2018-05-14 23:05:16 There were people in wheelchairs there too, what bothers me the most though is bringing your children! WTH is wrong with you that you’d bring children
423 2018-05-14 23:05:14 Yes, it’s oil dimwit. They are being responsible as a corporation to the potential risk to their clients.
424 2018-05-14 23:05:01 OK genius.  Please list all of the Trump actions that align with Russian interests.  Oil policy?  Nyet.  Syria policy?  Nyet.  Eastern Europe policy?  Nyet.    Please reply once you are done with the sads.
425 2018-05-14 23:04:27 Thank you for making such great efforts. Also can you work on OPEC? Can you make them lower the oil price?
426 2018-05-14 23:04:21 You mean great propaganda! Misleading & self serving for oil lobby.
427 2018-05-14 23:04:11 /3 Despite everyone obsessing over trading charts and oil pricing moves off the bottom, spend time at the ground level and ask what top line pricing incentivizes companies to invest for the longer term. We are not there yet
428 2018-05-14 23:04:08 What carbon dioxide removal?? The rest of that tweet hurts my brain because you don't read the news for geoengineering (China-Olympics, unis in U.K and U.S since 1989) & HAARP oil to microwave transmissions, etc.
429 2018-05-14 23:04:08 Yes I remember that old term. Now they have improved their ability to remove the OIL from the earth so they are called the Oil Sands. As far as being condescending goes, pot, meet kettle.
430 2018-05-14 23:03:38 Got my oil changed right in time before it started storming.

433 2018-05-14 23:03:00 Unfortunately the powers that be in the oil industry are using this to stop people from buying electric cars. This is what I'm trying to fight by working with the Oregon Electric Vehicle Association and working on Uber Electric
434 2018-05-14 23:02:59 There are foods that taste like non-foods (usually soap/motor oil/dirt) to some people. Cilantro is the worst offender. Arugula, pine nuts, & beets are some others.

443 2018-05-14 23:02:07 Better than landfill, but won't compete with oil on price most likely. Direct conversion to electricity with CCS in stationary plants would be a better environmental outcome so would be more justifiable. There's be a better energy return than 2 stage conversion/refining.
444 2018-05-14 23:02:05 /2  Oil prices still need to migrate higher to incentivize higher E&P field spending levels, OFS prices (partially to pay higher wages to attract younger talent) and ultimately sufficient ROIC to allow OFS co's to invest in their businesses. The energy model is still broken

453 2018-05-14 23:01:21 Since the US is by far the richest economy in the world, that means everywhere else is poorer. Even on a per capita basis, excluding tiny principalities like Hong Kong or Middle Eastern oil shiekdoms, only a handful of countries outpace the US and no major ones. So wrong again.

476 2018-05-14 22:58:10 Good point. OTOH, How many people die from coal particulate matter, natural gas leaks, wars over oil, etc? I'm thinking the advantage here is on the side of renewables.
477 2018-05-14 22:58:08 We count 67Kbpd in shipments to Israel (22% of total) since Erdogan threatened to cut off KRG oil exports on account of the Kurdistan referendum last year on September 25th.
478 2018-05-14 22:57:59 I just kinda feel like if you’re using a face wash and JUST a face wash to get your make up off and clean your face.. It’s kind of counter productive.. like use a makeup remover (balm, oil, lotion, watev) then clean your face with your wash. It’ll make a huge difference.

486 2018-05-14 22:57:01 It's heartbreaking.

493 2018-05-14 22:55:58 If he actually believes in God, (I hear he publically prays a lot), he must feel he is sent here to help destroy the earth AND that he and Trump are elected by God who evidently can't get enough oil and money either.

565 2018-05-14 22:43:48 Ha! So you haven't heard the new excuses? Let me tell: 1) the oil price just increased so not enough time to reflect on our economy. 2) there have been small changes so at least give bubu a break. 3) Go and create your own opportunity and don't wait for the govt

568 2018-05-14 22:43:35 My vote wasn't a protest vote. I voted for the candidate that was for universal, single-payer healthcare, against fracking, endless wars of aggression, for ending the Jim Crow prisoners for profit system, strong on climate change, tough on big oil, banks & big pharma.
569 2018-05-14 22:43:34 Neither here nor there, but a lot of money: Met Council Transpo Committee approves up to $65M contract with Mansfield Oil for bus diesel fuel for two years.
570 2018-05-14 22:43:12 @datekunkle Happens to the best of us! Did you get the oil changed yet?
571 2018-05-14 22:43:03 If you are focused on interests, the map is one place to start. Israel is an ally that is armed to the teeth and located in close proximity to huge oil Reserves and Europe's Southeastern flank.
572 2018-05-14 22:42:39 You know a huge part of the price you pay at the pumps is because of all the taxes added. You might want to ask the greens their plan to replace this revenue as well as the revenue generated by the royalties paid by the oil and gas sector.
573 2018-05-14 22:42:29 No no no no no no no. Yours is succincter, subtler, cleverer. Mine required three shoehorns, two crowbars and a dollop of lubricating oil to pull together 
574 2018-05-14 22:42:08 Does anyone have any recommendations for products to help prevent oily skin? I need to contain this oil

577 2018-05-14 22:41:35 @TimAndrewsHere Norway also gives all its citizens a cut of their oil earnings.

581 2018-05-14 22:40:59 Prior cancer treatments I had to cut out alot. No sugar low carbs etc. My kids found receipe for homemade nuggets. Chicken breast cut into nuggets - dip in egg, then pork rhine mix (crushed porkrhines, parmesan cheese and seasoning) repeat then fry in olive oil

585 2018-05-14 22:40:14 It may well turn out that fish oil supplementation is ineffective; but these studies, like most, use placebo amounts (1g) of fish oil. Hard to tell the amounts of EPA/DHA, but whatever 1 g is insufficient for a true test.

587 2018-05-14 22:40:08 Like asking the working poor to do more, big oil would have to suffer the market. Cuz I guarantee you if gas were to ever get that high, regular folks will find a way to get around without a car.
588 2018-05-14 22:39:48 We know oil never sleeps!

591 2018-05-14 22:39:35 Unlike the NDP who is doing nothing but taxing and hoping oil will go up in price. Takes a real idiot to support the socialist NDP.
592 2018-05-14 22:39:34 You know you're a redneck when you want oil and solvents in your water supply.
593 2018-05-14 22:39:29 When full service was full service...get a kick out of the 5 gallon cans of oil...fill er up and add a quart...

604 2018-05-14 22:38:10 Georgia finally passed two new qualifications for their 5%thc oil! PTSD and intractable pain! Only have 6 doctors in the state who write recommendations and take insurance. My closest one is 70 miles away, and no way of getting the oil but to drive it back from Colorado myself...
605 2018-05-14 22:37:40 September!!
606 2018-05-14 22:37:37 I guess you're not up on the times the United States is now the number one exporter of oil. We are no longer Hostage to the Middle East they can take their oil and shove it.

Me: “well you don’t need to check the oil on a car you’re not driving 
619 2018-05-14 22:36:08 Fuuu I just splashed some hot oil on my aRM
620 2018-05-14 22:36:04 Same thing I do but for OIL
621 2018-05-14 22:36:01 I don't think you have compensated for the fact that bitumen is a lower form of crude that requires greater upgrading than conventional light oil. Tidewater access does not improve the product. #cdnpoli
622 2018-05-14 22:35:43 Brian from Hillsong & ‘the smiling Preacher’ Joel Osteen. Only in it for the millions they get out of it, nothing more than that. Never understand how supposedly ‘smart ppl’ get conned by these carnts of ‘snake oil salesmen’ & they get conned out of $’s annually.
623 2018-05-14 22:35:14 Stealing by trick, wasting our oil money
624 2018-05-14 22:35:11 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
625 2018-05-14 22:35:09 #iVoteBTSBBMAs @BTS_twt  also people tend to think that climate change isnt a serious problem but currently the UN belives that natural gas and oil will be used up by 2050. like lads that shit serious
626 2018-05-14 22:34:51 Dad: “you know how to check your oil, right?”
Me: “yeah there’s a wand or something, right?”
Dad: “yeah it’s called a dipstick”
Me: “oh they named it after you?”
HEYOOOoooOoOOOooooOoooo
627 2018-05-14 22:34:47 So dumb. Billions gambled illegally and via off shore websites that could be a source of revenue, but no, let’s keep it “illegal”
628 2018-05-14 22:34:41 @ this person, you can try but you should first get medical advice,, (i’ve never noticed my anxiety getting less) or start with CBD oil to see if that helps. you’re very welcome
629 2018-05-14 22:34:34 I use Tatcha oil cleanser + Klairs foam wash and follow it up with a toner and a vitamin c serum. And moisturize!
630 2018-05-14 22:34:27 Hey Mike. Thanks for sharing your insights. Question: what sources did you rely on re shipments? Oil tankers are calling on Hodeidah.
631 2018-05-14 22:34:21 Nothing against people who work in oil field or anything like that but I don’t ever want to hear someone (with that type of job) say to me or even someone who’s working at a random place while IN COLLEGE to get a real job. NEVER.

633 2018-05-14 22:34:05 New oil projects also threatening UK coastline, one proposed by one of UKs finest beaches in Bournemouth. Decommissioning of oil removal rigs also a major concern.
634 2018-05-14 22:34:01 Do you have coconut oil or shea butter that helps hun!
635 2018-05-14 22:33:52 #iVoteBTSBBMAs @BTS_twt back to politics lads... as said before climate change is a serious world problem you can combat it by a) stop buying products with palm oil (check out indonesias rainforests) b) vote green politicians c) eat less meat
636 2018-05-14 22:33:45 Avocado oil is really changing the way I cook and how food tastes. Amazing. 
637 2018-05-14 22:33:31 The win of Anti American cleric in Irak elections should not be surprising. Since US presidential campaign, Trump keeps saying that US should “take” Irak’s oil and Irak should pay the US for its “help.” How can a pro-US Iraki candidate win with such rhetoric?
638 2018-05-14 22:33:27 Its the first day of summer classes. I made it from work in Viera to class Palm Bay in 25 minutes. I smell like oil and transmission fluid. Happy Monday 
639 2018-05-14 22:33:11 In political science there is something called the "curse of oil". Basically, how is it that many countries blessed with the abundance of oil are unable to harness it into shared wealth? Instead, many see corruption and extreme inequality.
640 2018-05-14 22:32:58 Turmeric is definitely good for inflamation. I have recently begun smoking a strain of marijuana called Harlequin. Its a high CBD, low THC strain so it helps with the pain without getting me too high. So maybe CBD oil if that's legal where you are.
641 2018-05-14 22:32:55 WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO HAVE COCONUT OIL IN IT
642 2018-05-14 22:32:51 Bet 45* is working on an oil crisis to justify rescinding oil-related sanctions and make a deal to buy Russian oil.
643 2018-05-14 22:32:39 I got an oil change and did laundry today and I feel exhausted af like I just worked a double or something. Teww murch honey!
644 2018-05-14 22:32:35 I agree the benefits of an “ideal Brexit” are clear.

However, the “ideal Brexit” that was sold to the 17.4m by a bunch of snake oil salespeople is totally, and utterly unbelievable.

656 2018-05-14 22:30:36 George Marshall didn’t oppose the creation of Israel for “Oil Flow”. He forsaw EXACTLY the problem of a group of outsiders talking land away to one group of people and “giving” it to another.

667 2018-05-14 22:29:32 Ya, Canada has VERY few refineries. We ship our oil to the U.S to get refined. 

Our production remains the same- AKA the best!
668 2018-05-14 22:29:25 Stupid olive oil.
669 2018-05-14 22:29:25 So you don't know if it was being autopiloted or not. You just bring it because.... why? I see accidents that look like this every day in Houston with normal cars. You're just publicizing this because the oil industry is giving you a fat check.

676 2018-05-14 22:28:05 I'm sad to say that most of these haters are from within the US. Big Oil, big auto, US MSM reliant on commercials, your President, Koch brothers, Rothschild, Rockefeller, the list is endless. :/
677 2018-05-14 22:27:58 if you heard of fossil fuels you're brainwashed. no way what so ever that bones turn into oil that isn't logical. they say that so the price can be high and sound more valuable. it's taxed heavy. in actuality oil replenishes faster than we drill it. it's like the earth's blood.
678 2018-05-14 22:27:27 意味ねぇええええw
679 2018-05-14 22:27:15 BiBi wants an Atlantic side home in Fl (gulf side too close to Mexico) when he is kicked out of Israel. One that has a view unencumbered by oil rigs. Oil Slick Rick needs help from Black Cube to find others to blame for his company's Medicare fraud. They need each other.
680 2018-05-14 22:27:06 Tesla & the EV explosion is definitely going to have huge, lasting impacts on our environment, probably just as frightening as what a century of CO2 emissions are doing.

It'd be nice if people just didn't drive as many cars but capitalism.

Honestly can't wait for an oil crisis.

693 2018-05-14 22:24:35 I wish men could treat me as well as coconut oil does
694 2018-05-14 22:24:17 For good reason. You get what you pay for and they sold their souls to a snake oil salesmen. They should feel disrespected. At least we know they can feel something.
695 2018-05-14 22:23:56 We're sending a message to Big Oil deep in Bight country this morning. Stay tuned! #PeopleVsOil #FightForTheBight
696 2018-05-14 22:23:49 You put me on that R.I.P. bumper sticker and that car will always have a dead battery or a flat tire. You’ll need an oil change every five days. Both tail lights will go out every time a cop is behind you. Don’t do me like that.
697 2018-05-14 22:23:46 Koch's use donation with "demands attached".(see FSU) .They pick who runs Science Dept and Economics Dept...insuring stupidity kelps their polluting oil profits up. Koch ran for Pres. once, on ending every social program this country has, incl. Public Educ., Soc. Security etc.
698 2018-05-14 22:23:42 Thanks to idiot Trump, we are on the cusp of major hostilities in the Middle East. If that happens, oil prices will rise, recession will follow & the long suffering people of the region will suffer even more. Trump isn’t worried because he’s too stupid to see it.
699 2018-05-14 22:23:39 I need some holy oil for my desktop. This thing run too slow.
700 2018-05-14 22:23:34 I get the same bullshit because I take it black...Who cares if I like my coffee like motor oil..
701 2018-05-14 22:23:29 I started using essential oils on my dryer balls and now all my laundry smells amazing. Thank you grapefruit essential oil!
702 2018-05-14 22:23:28 I pampered myself tonight, used dollops of moisturiser, treated my hair to a coconut oil overnight mask, applied a more than generous amount of balm to my lips and brewed a good cuppa 
703 2018-05-14 22:23:09 Thank you. In the same way that the tuna industry adopted the dolphin logo on sustainably caught fish in the 80s/90s, how about an Orangutan logo for palm oil based products that meet only the highest standards of preserving virgin forest  for prescious wildlife?
704 2018-05-14 22:23:02 I voted no, but he should probably use some beard oil, or other manscaping product.
705 2018-05-14 22:22:56 Lilac! Citrus blossoms! Truffle oil!
706 2018-05-14 22:22:56 The Oil field of Douleb is one of Scotland's top clubs.
707 2018-05-14 22:22:51 Cannabis oil helps many patients here in the states as well. Our leaders need to realize that cannabis is good medicine
708 2018-05-14 22:22:47 Made a essential oil blend that smells like roses. Too bad I didn't write down what I added. It has vetiver for the adaptagen but that's all I remember. Smells so good! #essentialoils
709 2018-05-14 22:22:33 2018, and the West remains silent in the plight of the #Rohingya
The massacres continue, rape, slaughter, beatings..
Is it because #MyanmarsKillingFields have no oil or natural resources to offer?
Or is it simply because Muslims are being murdered?!
710 2018-05-14 22:22:23 theo: why are you covered in baby oil?

717 2018-05-14 22:21:19 Sorry to interrupt your tweets, 
Apply mustard oil before you sleep. It has anti bacterial content.
718 2018-05-14 22:20:53 Just finished the book Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI. Awesome book but gruesome story of the conspiracy of prominent white citizens to murder the Osage & steal their money & oil rights.

720 2018-05-14 22:20:29 Have some shame the kingdoms in Arab world.Your oil will dry up one day. You have your hands stained with their blood too @kbsalsaud

725 2018-05-14 22:19:15 Entah lah. Tapi temenku pakai face oil organik kalau gak cocok itu reaksinya gak separah pakai serum. Jadi gak apa mencoba. Urusan skincare adalah coba mencoba
726 2018-05-14 22:19:01 We carry CBD oil!
727 2018-05-14 22:19:01 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
728 2018-05-14 22:18:59 Not if oil companies are exploiting more US oil.
729 2018-05-14 22:18:57 Wouldn't be so proud of winning things with billions of oil money thrown in. No build. No youth players. Just money. Kinda not something to celebrate.
730 2018-05-14 22:18:54 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "My mom put oil on her bird feeder to keep squirrels from stealing the bird food and" à l'adresse
731 2018-05-14 22:18:52 CBD peeps!!!! I need a quick bottle (like tomorrow, lol) of the BEST CBD oil for my dad in NJ! Any ideas???
732 2018-05-14 22:18:44 I'm thinking Trump tells Putin if I slam you with sanctions, don't worry, I'll give you this instead.  Qatar and Russia are owning oil right now.
733 2018-05-14 22:18:33 First thing I’m gonna do with my graduation money is get an oil change 
734 2018-05-14 22:18:26 Well gonna change my oil tomorrow hopefully and slap a new air filter in
735 2018-05-14 22:18:24 Just walked thru the make-up aisle.

Because someone broke an olive oil jar in the aisle i needed and im all about #ConflictAvoidance
736 2018-05-14 22:18:21 Kind of hard to restrict "mental issue" rights since medical records are PRIVATE and the left just made it legal to give someone HIV without disclosing you're infected in Cali.

I live in Texas...oil lovin' Texas has more clean energy than Cali.
737 2018-05-14 22:18:17 How I got -10% oil In my car 
738 2018-05-14 22:18:15 @GeorgiaEdeMD Coconut and avocado oil seem fine for me but I am not sure about olive oil. Do you have any thoughts on olive oil? Are there known problem compounds in olive oil (organic, extra virgin)?
739 2018-05-14 22:18:08 Aaaand consider taking vitamins or supplements that support your hair growth like biotin or fish oil
740 2018-05-14 22:17:51 u can be my mule before i slaver myself in baby oil bc if it works for u it will work for everyone
741 2018-05-14 22:17:37 Con-men and snake oil believers.
Old school carnival crap .
742 2018-05-14 22:17:35 Punkinbutt teething oil 
743 2018-05-14 22:17:33 look. look. it was a genuinely worrying and harrowing moment for me ok i thought i stole some olive oil and pesto from an italian restaurant and poured it in the toilet ok
744 2018-05-14 22:17:29 In our current state of living and infrastructure, one needs oil to survive. In the future I hope we can reduce.
745 2018-05-14 22:17:22 you know, all the fun things in life
746 2018-05-14 22:17:18 Guess Man City fans don’t like being reminded of their irrelevance up until oil money fueled their kitty.
747 2018-05-14 22:16:59 The WH is been turned in to a Department store/auction hous. Contracts being sold, oil and gas producers made a high bid to let the Iran deal go away. 
Ofcourse oil and gas prices  go up. 
And god knows what else they are selling? 
DT friend sells steel & aluminium stock #tariffs
748 2018-05-14 22:16:50 Struggle a oil bit just to get to Success

750 2018-05-14 22:16:17 I took my car to get new tires, alignment, rotation and a oil change. Shawty said hour and a half...more like  two and a half.

752 2018-05-14 22:15:58 He E4’d Galchenyuk to the Oil lol.   E5 idiot
753 2018-05-14 22:15:55 My skins is very sensitive I’m allergic to everything you can think off so I have to be careful for what I use and I use this oil before applying makeup and when I take it off and it helps so much with break outs you can get it at ultra for like 10$ it’s great !
754 2018-05-14 22:15:43 I’ve worked with a lot of FN people, hard working, eager to learn, and back the oil sands
755 2018-05-14 22:15:31 Too good to press olives but will be the first squeaky wheel asking for oil
756 2018-05-14 22:15:30 There is money in drilling oil I hear mind you...
757 2018-05-14 22:15:18 Basically a mini Houston with more of a direct path to oil lol
758 2018-05-14 22:15:17 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
759 2018-05-14 22:15:10 I’m irritated. Besides OIL, ICE, Wall St...even NTSB is busting your balls. Tesla is a national treasure. A major manufacturing...
760 2018-05-14 22:15:04 why is everything i own covered in coconut oil
761 2018-05-14 22:14:51 桃井さん起きてえらいね！！

Get a Free chicken box with an oil change
765 2018-05-14 22:14:09 @realDonaldTrump my gawd you're a bloviating bag of hot air, aren't you?
The rubes in Angrywhitemanistan love this snake oil salesmen thing, but any educated American is insulted beyond the pale by having a president as obviously stupid as you are, not uneducated, just moronic
766 2018-05-14 22:14:06 HATCH,  RESIGN NOW, MAKE ROOM FOR YOUR REPLACEMENT.
767 2018-05-14 22:14:06 お持ち帰り！

769 2018-05-14 22:13:46 Mix some sugar and a little olive oil
770 2018-05-14 22:13:46 There is an oil in everything / 
That's how the hue gets in
771 2018-05-14 22:13:39 Will #USA, #uk #France and #UN bomb #Israel  for killing dozens of ppl in #Gaza.
Or these A holes can only act in countries having oil fields?
#shame #POTUS
772 2018-05-14 22:13:36 You know what makes eating a healthy salad even worse? A criminally low amount of dressing. 2 tsp of olive oil and 1 tsp of balsamic is not enough for ANY salad.
773 2018-05-14 22:13:16 Is it a wealthy oil baron sheik taking his tigers for a swim?
774 2018-05-14 22:13:06 Haha ok 1st double winners, 1st winners in Europe actually 1st to win a second time in Europe before any other team, won it all and where were you totally non existent without Abromovich oil money a no one! Who bought success!
775 2018-05-14 22:12:40 Try avocado oil or olive oil
776 2018-05-14 22:12:30 When I stopped oil in my diet things started to get much better in my health.
777 2018-05-14 22:12:02 No heavy oil, no health, no fun. 
778 2018-05-14 22:11:56 Basically, to put it simply: I take my car in for an oil change. While it's there, the mechanic breaks the axle. The mechanic then wants to charge me to replace the axle. You're the mechanic in this scenario.
779 2018-05-14 22:11:56 lmaoooo the boys at the oil change spot got my instagram and gave me the synthetic oil bc i said i'm a rockets fan and gave them lil rockets shit i had in the car.
780 2018-05-14 22:11:56 What the hell would we want Australia for? You literally have no exports, no oil, and a bunch of shit that kills people!
781 2018-05-14 22:11:52 They are Forcing us to except drilling in the  Gulf or More F racking which is causing all kinds of unforseen problems sinkholes ground tremors getting worse We have the technology we must change to alternatives to Oil we must stop being greedy 4our great grand babies and yours
782 2018-05-14 22:11:50 Daily washing with a gentle cleanser that doesn’t dry out ya skin (I use plain rose water or witch hazel), moisturizer ALWAYS, and exfoliate with a gentle scrub or peel. Spot treat with tea tree oil and weekly masks.
783 2018-05-14 22:11:28 Hmm, the gas station attendants wear suite and neckties. The man that is checking the oil level, was using his neck tie to wipe off the dipstick and he had to send it to the cleaners.
784 2018-05-14 22:11:27 Arabian oil was controlled by the Saudis for the explicit purpose that Britain and America could control it.  Sure they overthrew Iran's democratic government when they were going to nationalise their oil

786 2018-05-14 22:11:11 *mom putting oil blend on my forehead* 
“miya you have a nugget head”
wow thanks mother, so much love
787 2018-05-14 22:10:53 There’s nothing quite as refreshing as chugging 3 teaspoons of fish oil mixed in a cup of Bai blueberry lemonade on a 90 degree day! 
788 2018-05-14 22:10:47 I was more worried about bushes, trees, grass and dog poop. Sure though, we can talk about fire and grease and I guess oil.
789 2018-05-14 22:10:44 Hmm.... idk then lol. I only wet it a little put the oil and 2 shampoos and i do that like every week sometimes every 2 weeks
790 2018-05-14 22:10:43 this oil change is gonna take an hour and a half and I’m in desperate need of a nap 
791 2018-05-14 22:10:43 if I got that done, and the fuel starvation flap+filter, then the next weekend would be finishing brake ducting and a simple oil change, basically
792 2018-05-14 22:10:41 my mom, sister, and I just spent a good fifteen minutes trying to open a jar of coconut oil 
793 2018-05-14 22:10:31 inject a costco multivitamin in there and some fish oil and u good
794 2018-05-14 22:10:28 My question is spot on. Before Tax Cuts, OPEC controlled Domestic US Oil & Gas prices. Tax Cuts give a $2.5 Billion break to US Oil Companies. They chose to use OPEC speculation to determine Consumer gas prices, ignoring the Tax Cuts benefits that can be passed on to Consumers.
795 2018-05-14 22:10:27 I even put baby oil or Vaseline on top.
796 2018-05-14 22:10:26 おはご！

801 2018-05-14 22:09:45 Yes but it has began to fail and become an over-priced cartel. When Arabian oil was first nationalized they brought in Western contractors. That's why it worked.
802 2018-05-14 22:09:40 Ese vacio que uno tiene cuando ves que la persona que te gusta falta
803 2018-05-14 22:09:38 Gonna fix this acne the all natural way again. Gonna do a before & after collage in the future but I bought:
- black soap (cleanser)
- rose water (toner) 
- Shea butter & lemon oil (nighttime moisturizer & dark mark corrector)
- jojoba oil (daytime moisturizer).
804 2018-05-14 22:09:33 Try the inversion method with castor oil for like 2 weeks and then again after a pause of 3 weeks
805 2018-05-14 22:09:26 I know saying this to you, of all people, might be dangerous, but I know, experientially, full spectrum cannabis oil, aka RSO, not only extends lives, but increases the quality of that time. Please, look into it. If you live in a bs state that doesn't approve, come to Oregon.
806 2018-05-14 22:09:24 Liberals do the same thing we jus want equality and jobs in our country and working Americans what libs want socialism make a six figure income right out of college and frown on oil field workers making 70 thousand first year out or any blue collar job
807 2018-05-14 22:09:17 War and unrest in the Middle east higher gas prices and Russia will be able to sell their oil cheaper but they can sell even when their are sanction  on them. Will say it one more time WHO PROFFITS from everything Donnie has done the money trail  is so strong nobody can hide it.
808 2018-05-14 22:09:01 Pitch oil #NiceForWhat 
809 2018-05-14 22:08:44 When the oil industry was nationalized, Arabia flooded the oil market that drove the prices down at the behest of the US.
810 2018-05-14 22:08:13 Por qué  no tienen la máscara de pestañas milk de cannabis oil? @SephoraMX
811 2018-05-14 22:08:06 Since it's birth the Wahabbists have been a cancer not just on Islam, but on this planet.  They export their extremist ideas everywhere in the world, and get the US to suck them for oil.
812 2018-05-14 22:08:05 I don't know anyone that dislikes the sprouts. Baked Brussels with lemon & oil & truffle salt--oh my goodness.
813 2018-05-14 22:08:04 I’m willing to go and load my cart full of patchouli oil and see how serious they are.

815 2018-05-14 22:07:37 Last year our cukes were killed off a tad early by a white powdery mold. I wonder if this clove oil will work on that this year... I'll tell the head gardener (i.e. the wife), I'm just the "help" (i.e. I dig holes)
816 2018-05-14 22:07:31 ال baby oil ده أحلى منوم في العالم
817 2018-05-14 22:07:27 The guy at the car shop just told me he paying for my oil change  real nigga
818 2018-05-14 22:07:22 I know that the Rapture sounds kind of sweet, but all of us leftovers pretty quickly die if it happens. too many pious Christians would be piloting airplanes, operating oil tankers, pushing the no-it's-not-nuclear-war-don't-fire-the-missiles buttons, etc.
819 2018-05-14 22:07:20 I just looooooove oil. Bio oil on my skin coconut oil on my hair olive oil on my roasted butternut squash
820 2018-05-14 22:07:04 use the tee tree oil she said it’ll work better she said ... smh

824 2018-05-14 22:06:33 Lmao the Nigga doin my oil change offered me a water cause the weed was so loud he assumed I had Cotton mouth  I ain’t even bust pack open let alone blow it.
825 2018-05-14 22:06:32 I don't understand why anyone would ever drink any alcohol anywhere ever when there's unrestricted access to supercritical CO2 extracted full spectrum cannabis oil distilled to ~99% purity. Eat it drink it vape it, blissful nirvana, the gateway to nextgen perception // #ThirdEye
826 2018-05-14 22:06:17 You do know that we no longer have $40 oil
827 2018-05-14 22:06:10 Hot oil: 1
Medina's hand: 0
828 2018-05-14 22:06:02 Cooked some aubergine earlier, being all domestic goddess.  Left it in kitchen roll to soak up the oil.  Popped it in fridge.  Found it in the compost bin after I'd put the boy to sleep.  Mr Banane is in for a few choice words!
829 2018-05-14 22:05:57 Condescending attitude aside, you must be quite young (or not well informed) to think that
They were called the tar sands for decades before being rebranded the more PR-friendly but deceptive "oil sands"
I don't use the term "clean coal" either, for the same reason, it's BS
830 2018-05-14 22:05:19 Yep. The mass media refuse to cover continued GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra in West Africa by British govt and their jihadists for oil. Did you know that 21 Jews and their children got arrested on Shabbat for worshipping in Nigeria?
831 2018-05-14 22:05:14 @NorthCountyBCG has the absolute worst customer service ever. I JUST need an oil change. If I would’ve known I’d be waiting over an hour I would’ve done it myself
832 2018-05-14 22:04:52 my dumbass bought a vehicle that requires octane 93 during a fucking oil crisis. i’m paying 50$ for 30L what heck
833 2018-05-14 22:04:48 Actually Ulay ran out of oil a good few years ago and have been replaced by Olay, there nearest neighbours. Different countries, although very similar oil.
834 2018-05-14 22:04:28 my cleansing balm is (finally) running out and i can't decide whether to go back to jojoba oil or get fancy and try a cleansing oil

836 2018-05-14 22:04:21 You love righteousness and hate wickedness; 
therefore God,your God,

あなたは義を愛し、悪を憎む。
このゆえに神、あなたの神は喜びの油を
あなたの友がらにまさって、あなたに注がれた。

837 2018-05-14 22:04:16 @gossmakeupartis  Hi Regarding Ordinary skin care products.  Yes they are great but I think they use Palm oil.  I tried to get answer - none came!!  Please try to get ethical on your sight
838 2018-05-14 22:03:56 If O's teleprompter broke the "Uh Uh Uh's" would #multiply ad nauseam. He can't communicate what he really is.

861 2018-05-14 22:00:41 Oil revenues were in the basement but they could have instituted incentives for companies to come work here instead of taxing them further. But hey if you want to think I'm unreal for thinking what's happening in the US oil patch would be good up here then think so.

877 2018-05-14 21:59:10 Who would fund such a study & be objective about it?
Obviously anybody who would pay 4 a study like that would be in pursuit of a desired outcome
Obviously there are pros and cons of each but the point is moot because new pipelines are for expansion, not to displace oil by train

894 2018-05-14 21:57:05 That framing makes the tweet make sense for sure but I also wanted people to understand the rent price gouging that’s going on in Austin and in the oil patch. Texas is much more complex than the southern states it is usually lumped in with by coastal ppl.

935 2018-05-14 21:49:28 Side note about earlier: An oil crisis at this stage is very much avoidable if the correct decisions are made. We're not freefalling.

The thing is... they cheer over the actions that lead to an oil crisis. So... it can be avoided, but if nothing is done, it'll happen.

950 2018-05-14 21:46:40 Regardless of Andrew's moronic notions on tax, it's a bad idea to suggest those of us who consume alcohol or to tobacco or who gamble should be subjected to the ridiculous tax rates on those items. Sin taxes generate more revenue in Alberta than oil & gas royalties.

975 2018-05-14 21:43:42 Where’s all the big nations who want to fight “terrorism”. This is genocide and you won’t lift a finger, because it doesn’t fit your agenda. There’s nothing in it for you. No gold and no oil. #RohingyaCrisis #Rohingya
976 2018-05-14 21:43:31 The jealous will always say we bought it yet..Blackburn born and bred, not Russia. Millions made in Blackburn, not Qatar. Blackburn fan, and if I had oil money, I’d do the same as Jack. #BetterOnceThanNever
977 2018-05-14 21:43:19 Money for old rope, can't believe so many owners have bought snake oil
978 2018-05-14 21:43:17 @TheTravisW with that sweet sweet bicep oil
979 2018-05-14 21:43:03 Finally getting an oil change and one of the filters changed 
980 2018-05-14 21:42:42 U.S. shares rose Monday as trade tensions cooled off and energy companies posted gains amid higher oil prices.
981 2018-05-14 21:42:33 saudis have no shame they want the oil in yemen 
they dont rule yet yemen and i pray they never will
the #sauds are bad people and most saudis have no idea what is being done in their name as all news is censored including internet in saudi
982 2018-05-14 21:42:24 And your grandparents were playing u7 when city last won the title without oil money
983 2018-05-14 21:42:23 Me: the US will be the world’s major oil supplier by 2020

People: oh that means gas will be cheaper right?

Me: nooooo
984 2018-05-14 21:42:19 Tesla has a lot of enemies. Imagine you were an oil company? A legacy auto maker? An auto dealer? What’s a few million in spreading fake news like this when trillions are on the line
985 2018-05-14 21:42:13 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
986 2018-05-14 21:42:13 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
987 2018-05-14 21:42:12 Looool Sipho unxibe impahla yakwa Jumbo.. Unuka I fish oil 
988 2018-05-14 21:41:42 So what about sending our troops to war for oil and what about police brutality how come all that isn't outlawed lol
989 2018-05-14 21:41:39 Gas is a dollar a gallon more than when Republicans rammed through GOPTAXSCAM. Big Oil is reaping huge profits just like Trump promised them for campaign contributions
990 2018-05-14 21:41:24 China has a very young economy and will dwarf all others. One the oil price is pegged to the Yen instead of the dollar, which is inevitable, America will be like Superman wearing a Kryptonite suit.
991 2018-05-14 21:41:16 Moving our embassy to Jerusalem was a colossal screw up. Like previous gop administrations, they are owned by Israel and this is just going to destabilize the area. Makes more money for their wealthy donors in oil and military industrial complexes too. It doesn’t help anything.
992 2018-05-14 21:41:10 Bit let down could of done better with all the oil money
993 2018-05-14 21:41:07 Great, maybe they will finally leave Big Oil alone.
994 2018-05-14 21:40:53 While the US has 7200 (as of 2.5 years ago). Is it only termed WMD when another country with oil reserves and a non-cooperative government has it?
995 2018-05-14 21:40:33 Just need to swap city for arsenal to return to the days without Arab oil money
996 2018-05-14 21:40:16 Just a little bit of oil, and... Come on! Come on, you little son of a bitch!
997 2018-05-14 21:40:13 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
998 2018-05-14 21:40:13 The oil companies kidnapped my dog. Osama bin laden is still alive!
999 2018-05-14 21:40:10 Meridian peanut butter doesn't contain palm oil....just peanuts :)
1000 2018-05-14 21:40:06 For sure! The 2 thoughts seem to blend as seemlessly as beards and oil. Or poop.
1001 2018-05-14 21:40:01 every day El Trumpo tries to formulate a clear sentence, a russian bot assumes he is winning #tiredofwinning
1002 2018-05-14 21:39:49 Gear oil is the worst!!! Lol
1003 2018-05-14 21:39:46 Oil changes are coming!

1006 2018-05-14 21:39:39 By the way, the tax cuts really do stimulate the economy somewhat and inflation is good for oil guys and bankers. Go figure.
1007 2018-05-14 21:39:36 Our long-term @Ford Mustang Shelby  GT350 drinks oil, eats rubber, and consumes California canyon roads for dessert:…
1008 2018-05-14 21:39:34 Well, I'm upset about the 5 people a day that are killed on UK roads, the pollution, the decimation of wildlife, the destruction of our environment, the sheer space given to cars, the oil industry, the motorists threatening my life for using the roads I pay for... aren't you?
1009 2018-05-14 21:39:24 Is it for warming the engine or buying engine oil?
1010 2018-05-14 21:39:23 Didn’t before. No. This is 3 months old. Saudi has been supplying the world oil since the 70s. Let’s go back to the moderate part though. When we’re women allowed to drive again?
1011 2018-05-14 21:39:22 These cats out here with the snake oil
1012 2018-05-14 21:39:22 Just stood like a twat for 30 mins dripping head to toe in baby oil and my tan looks 20 times worse brilliant x do not recommend
1013 2018-05-14 21:39:21 My father finished my Cod Liver Oil & never remembered to buy a new bottle for me

1017 2018-05-14 21:38:57 i was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna
1018 2018-05-14 21:38:54 Hmmm.  Yeah, that oil change outfit looks kinda Deep State.  Better send a patriot with an AR-15 to check it out.
1019 2018-05-14 21:38:54 Nah just use castor and coconut oil at night does it help?
1020 2018-05-14 21:38:46 I spoke to our Oil Policy Expert Ellen Wald who said, “I expect that we will see oil prices continue on an upward trend throughout the summer and therefore we will see gasoline prices increase probably throughout the summer.” @ActionNewsJax
1021 2018-05-14 21:38:45 So today it took the toyota car people 2 hours to do my oil change. Which they said would happen in an hour.

1025 2018-05-14 21:37:56 Waiting to get my oil changed and the employees at valvoline are chanting the spongebob theme song. Service and a show. I ain’t mad.
1026 2018-05-14 21:37:53 The first traces of olive oil can be dated back to…
1027 2018-05-14 21:37:28 Explain to me how the people of Alaska are stealing from the oil companies.
1028 2018-05-14 21:37:27 Por encima de los 60 dolares o mas, Trump sabe que los Saudis trataran de aumentar su producción para desalentar el Oil Shale , y es ahi donde Trump los pillara al salirse del tratado de Iran, no podran con el empuje! Trumpism
1029 2018-05-14 21:37:08 I'm home alone cause my mom is meeting a friend and while cooking i accidentally spilled a drop of oil on the stove and there literally was a fire for a few seconds
1030 2018-05-14 21:37:00 Hmm...have you tried the peanut butter with no palm oil....would be better maybe? What company produces the one you buy?
1031 2018-05-14 21:36:50 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
1032 2018-05-14 21:36:42 The Bush government would have done anything to control the oil in the east. ANYTHING, Cowboy! Gop control = anything goes.
1033 2018-05-14 21:36:35 it’s an oil based skin treatment , but it worked really good for me like a year ago
1034 2018-05-14 21:36:05 They’re awful. Peppermint oil on my temples and excedrin are my saviors!
1035 2018-05-14 21:35:53 So you're telling me that HPD can test CBD oil but they can't test all the thousands of rape kits???
1036 2018-05-14 21:35:50 Your beards need coconut oil.
1037 2018-05-14 21:35:35 It was either debt or watching twice as many people out more unemployed.  Oil revenues were in the basement.
1038 2018-05-14 21:35:21 Moms dont like it but its normal for babies there learning to grip & grab ya tu sabe put some baby mittens socks(spsnishShit) put cream in his face so it slides off u know vaseline/baby or coconut oil
1039 2018-05-14 21:35:10 A bronzing facial mask, earthy purple, with beetle mica, peacock oil, and exfoliating coconut fiber. It's a rough brick.
1040 2018-05-14 21:35:09 Oh you mean when we had the CIA overthow there democratically elected president who was going to nationalize their oil. We paid to have the Shaw of Iran installed as a puppet so we could get oil cheaply.
1041 2018-05-14 21:35:06 RT @LivingSafely: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this May? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.

1047 2018-05-14 21:34:16 The oil lobby and union lobby are alive and strong (read: fighting for their life)
1048 2018-05-14 21:34:06 Buy a oil drain plug for the lawn mower at Keith's Small Engine, $6.80, good deal, and then clean up the side walk by the garage and deep wash 2 bike, beautiful. 今天买割草机配件，洗水泥地和两部单车，招财进宝。
1049 2018-05-14 21:34:02 Gustavo estas viendo esta situación políticamente y no es tu fuerte, Trump lo que esta tratando es de crear el ambiente económico correcto para las industrias de Oil Shale , sabemos para que ellos puedan sacar su derivado costo efectivo el barril de petróleo necesita estar >
1050 2018-05-14 21:33:55 So, no floats for the oil industry basically
1051 2018-05-14 21:33:52 I got an oil change this morning. They told me my two front tires were bad and needed changed ASAP. Still made the 150 mile drive one way to see @TriviumOfficial. And the tires haven't blown so far! @TriviumPaolo @matthewkheafy @coreytrivium @AlexBentDrums
1052 2018-05-14 21:33:40 Hey @EPA, 
I am reaching out to better understand the agency and its purpose. So, what is your purpose? What do you guys do to promote certain issues like climate change, pollution, oil spills, etc? And what is your stance on climate change? Is it real and is it important?
1053 2018-05-14 21:33:35 フォトショで変換してます？それとも別ソフトですか？？フォトショだと変換の仕方次第であまり変化なく変換出来たりもするんですが…
1054 2018-05-14 21:33:32 Think of it this way:
The bigest sales advertisements company in the U.S.A. is our government. They have A lot of sales men and women that sells us "snake oil" just too make broke.
1055 2018-05-14 21:33:31 Potential new comedy, where @grahamhenry and I spend 30 mins trying to work out how to put oil in his car 
1056 2018-05-14 21:33:28 I would agree organic is irrelevant. The reason I asked was that the Peanut Butter we buy says that it contains organic sustainable palm oil. Just want to understand whether these plantations are contributing to the problem.
1057 2018-05-14 21:33:28 lol yeah if after 2 more days or so i will...currently have like oil in ear to soften wax and see if it’ll help
1058 2018-05-14 21:33:11 Sounds like when Cadburys ruined their chocolate. I knew it tasted different, then I found out about the palm oil.
1059 2018-05-14 21:33:05 have you tried bio oil ?
1060 2018-05-14 21:32:48 Coconut oil
1061 2018-05-14 21:32:40 Yeah, but i also know Texaco Tillerson was brought in to Make Oil Big Profits Again.
1062 2018-05-14 21:32:37 Countries accepting oil over being strong with Iran will be hurt in the long run.Iran will cave anyway.
1063 2018-05-14 21:32:36 Domestic oil and gas, tech(social, mobile and cloud), industrial, healthcare, and retail.
1064 2018-05-14 21:32:36 Buy jasmine or basmati rice . Then use the ratio 1 cup of rice is to 1 and a half cups of water , add oil but not salt because salt does something I forgot what .. let it boil and as soon as the water reduces to the same level as the rice, lower your heat to the lowest
1065 2018-05-14 21:32:35 Happy Birthday T @Steele3000 peace, love, and coconut oil haha  love you and I hope you have a great day!

You can eat it with palm oil stew. Something traditional sha.
1069 2018-05-14 21:32:18 Try using organic coconut oil, rub on scalp leave on over night then wash the next morning. Works great!

1073 2018-05-14 21:31:51 It’s been awhile since I’ve been a Nebraska prosecutor but when I was there poss of mj >2oz was an infraction, by statute punishable by a fine only. Hash oil/edibles/PWID were obviously different but that’s not the same as the “smoking weed” that was originally referenced
1074 2018-05-14 21:31:39 every time I paint with oil I underestimate their ability to get on my entire body
1075 2018-05-14 21:31:32 So you're saying that someone that isn't good at speaking English is not intelligent.... You are an Engineer, i expect you to know beyond that circle.

1078 2018-05-14 21:31:22 Think about what you have just said the next time you fill your car with gas. It's an inconvenient truth, but it's all about the oil that the world needs and cannot survive without.
1079 2018-05-14 21:31:20 The baby oil in the bath trick to remove fake tan works a treat 
1080 2018-05-14 21:31:18 is there an explanation somewhere for why the oil industry and not the coal industry
1081 2018-05-14 21:31:10 Facts everyone knows:
Palm oil comes from palm trees
Pee is stored in the balls

1088 2018-05-14 21:30:10 Who’s the snake oil lady lol
1089 2018-05-14 21:30:04 That was the rationale behind the Iraq invasion 16 years ago, it was going to be "self-funding" because the oil, only al Quaida in Iraq started to sabotage the pipelines and we never could get that to work.
But hey, maybe a Very Stable Genius can succeed where others failed.

1091 2018-05-14 21:29:56 I can vouch for how good the honey oil is in the Burgh. Just sayin'.
1092 2018-05-14 21:29:54 Thank for the info. However, @beardbrand does way way more than just beard oil my friend. The name “beard” may be in the company name, but they give everything you need to succeed at LIFE as well. It’s more than a store, it’s a community. Please don’t try to push your brand on me
1093 2018-05-14 21:29:49 Mueller is following the oil

1094 2018-05-14 21:29:44 Yes, it is called “We recommend a $255 service every time you want a simple oil change”
1095 2018-05-14 21:29:42 Many highly educated people such as engineers,  geologists,  IT professionals do FIFO to mining and oil/gas projects. The pay is usually vastly superior to a city job and offers great experience. I dislike the sentence,  "They are people usually without a year 12 education".
1096 2018-05-14 21:29:35 Yeah parabens do nothing, propylene glycol is totally fine, you could maybe be concerned about SLS but only if you have VERY sensitive skin.

Looks like most of the suggested replacements here are expensive junk and half of them have actual irritants like essential oil/charcoal
1097 2018-05-14 21:29:10 I often find myself running out of olive oil mid-session and it's super embarrassing
1098 2018-05-14 21:28:48 every time i put coconut oil on my legs my dog makes it a challenge to lick it off
1099 2018-05-14 21:28:44 ALL I FUCKING WANT IS A SYNTHETIC OIL CHANGE FOR UNDER 60$ !
1100 2018-05-14 21:28:12 Sandal and beard oil sales would soar. The place would thrive.
1101 2018-05-14 21:28:10 Just when #Ford announces the 'death' of passenger cars, #oil prices start rising again & will probably not drop for the rest of 2018. Those new #SUVs better have tiny #turbo engines! #OPEC #compactcar
1102 2018-05-14 21:28:02 Imagine that. Make China Great again. Instead of punishing China for bad acts, why not just give them our secrets? We’ve already saved Russia’s economy with high (manipulated) oil prices, let’s help Chinese govt also
1103 2018-05-14 21:28:01 boil u some potatoes, take them out, and then season em then roast em in the oven w/ olive oil 
1104 2018-05-14 21:28:01 And which oil executives run the GWPF? You seem much given to making wild allegations.
1105 2018-05-14 21:27:50 Is oil block d only way to amass wealth in govt? Mumu on steroids!
1106 2018-05-14 21:27:48 I feel a bit calmer tonight. I bought a coconut oil and pink grapefruit bodywash, so I’m looking forward to my morning shower.
1107 2018-05-14 21:27:37 Do not get me started on Kit Kats and plam oil... we will be here all night. ;)
1108 2018-05-14 21:27:34 Tea Pain @TeaPainUSA
If what @MichaelAvenatti is sayin' is true, then we have verified one of the biggest pieces of the Steele Dossier.  This involves the sale of 19.5% of Rosneft Oil and pushes the corruption/collusion/bribery numbers into the billions.  Yep, BILLIONS!
1109 2018-05-14 21:27:11 You're my tweeter here right now. Ppl in 45's camp have abandoned logic, constructive criticism of a snake oil salesman that has shown without doubt to be an out right liar  so $$ grubbing as to sell our his own country. Can we get some smelling salts to WAKE UP the "base"
1110 2018-05-14 21:27:02 Can’t forget labels that say “healthy” “natural” and so on usually are pack with nasty oils and added junk. Canola oil = bad Soy = bad.
1111 2018-05-14 21:26:51 Did you know Ted Cruz’s Dad killed JFK and his wife’s no oil painting?
1112 2018-05-14 21:26:51 When you look up places selling CBD oil in OKC, The Oklahoman is on the list. Either Google's made a mistake or we've got a new business model.
1113 2018-05-14 21:26:50 WHAT A SHIT DAY SEEING A BIT OF OIL CELEBRATING
1114 2018-05-14 21:26:26 Haha!... See the Share Holder Action Group was being pushed again today on LSE, wonder who instigated that???.
See they need someone with Oil & Gas technical knowledge to lead the group, no point collecting votes on paper if they don’t know what to do with them???...
1115 2018-05-14 21:26:01 It does have more, but without new right of exploitation & development, the 33% from OPEC can make or break the oil market of the United States. Oil is not unlimited, it's not rain water. Once supplies are gone, they are gone. We need good deals with OPEC & Trump is damaging that
1116 2018-05-14 21:25:56 Same when Iranians say down with the US Regime. It's not targeted at US people. US/UK overthrew elected Mossadegh in 53 as he nationalized Iran's oil etc. They know their history
Hasbaras know this. Better to block them like this one They get paid We only get a headache from lies
1117 2018-05-14 21:25:55 Didn’t even have to ask...Got my oil change paid for  Suzie out here today! 
1118 2018-05-14 21:25:48 My mom swears on those fish oil pills??? I dont have any good advice, i just take excedren. Sorry man! Good luck!
1119 2018-05-14 21:25:32 Once again, agreed in general, although BS detectors were always needed! Religion, snake oil sellers etc.
1120 2018-05-14 21:25:29 Baby oil is the best way to get tan off, pass it on x
1121 2018-05-14 21:25:28 Good someone pointed they knew about. Probably hamas puting fire to their own source of food and oil did not provide a lot of hope
1122 2018-05-14 21:25:26 Salmon with some shit sprinkled on top (I like Old Bay because I’m from Maryland), asparagus with some other shit sprinkled on top (salt, pepper, olive oil; lemon and red pepper flakes if you fancy). Bake at 350 for 15 and 11 mins respectively.
1123 2018-05-14 21:25:20 I think the only RX in Texas currently for CBD oil is for epilepsy. Mine is a desiccated slipped/compressed lumbar disc. Sometimes I cannot walk or stand. It sucks because I am only 44 and I have two small kiddos.
1124 2018-05-14 21:25:14 Fire farm bureau coop oil and gas. Jesus is insulted by em. And huge sabic plastics. And Fire  Expressway automobiles.
1125 2018-05-14 21:24:56 Sadly, not until September.

Also, my beard oil guy would fall right off his unicycle if he thought I was ordering beard product from Amazon.
1126 2018-05-14 21:24:51 Senior good pm 4rm Naija. Hope ur doing fine today? I guess u will be in the studio. Really want to work with you but, this $$$ always slow us in making the move. We have the dream but only insider can view it and make it happen when the oil is there.
1127 2018-05-14 21:24:44 Yes, but there's no way we can plant enough soon enough, let alone wait for them to mature.
The best place would of course be the tropics, for fast-growing trees and bamboo; but good luck with persuading Brazilian ranchers and Indonesian palm oil farmers to give up their incomes!
1128 2018-05-14 21:24:43 No don’t scratch! Oil! Pain is beauty!
1129 2018-05-14 21:24:29 You hos stay talking about how your pussy is so bomb, yet you have to spit to start or drown that bitch in baby oil. 
1130 2018-05-14 21:24:21 It's apparently about making monies due to unrest in the Middle East causing volatility in oil markets
1131 2018-05-14 21:24:03 Living Lord,

Your love has held @FLOTUS and kept her through this suffering. Now may your hope and healing lead #flotus quickly to a place of restoration. O Lord the oil of your healing flows through her like a living stream. Amen
1132 2018-05-14 21:23:58 Only thing you can do to impress me is to find or create a substitute for Oil!

1134 2018-05-14 21:23:40 @RealCandaceO I have 30 gallons of Neem oil for you!...give @kanyewest some...before you use it..Google the properties of it...
1135 2018-05-14 21:23:29 Just remember, the People are firmly behind you. Make the case. Oil/ICE, Etc. want You gone.  Book yourself on Morning Joe.
1136 2018-05-14 21:23:26 Lynda. All aromatherapy oil and well-intentioned advice. Brrr.
1137 2018-05-14 21:23:23 @jaaayLENo peppermint oil is great for headaches ... rub some on your temples and in the middle of your forehead it cures the pain quickly. 
1138 2018-05-14 21:23:23 Lol....Tesla vs Big Oil take one 
1139 2018-05-14 21:23:21 Boeing's cutting oil....not to be messed with and I had to mess with approximately 12 gallons of it.. Well it messed with me... Yup... Monday. ...
1140 2018-05-14 21:23:20 Socialists seem to divorce themselves first from simple economics. Chavez thought that everyone could live off oil revenue and nationalised and closed up most everything else. Exactly the opposite of what was needed. Then the price of oil fell. Not a shovel left, just a hole.
1141 2018-05-14 21:23:10 RANDY WADKINS IS A DUMBASS quote un quote Scientist

He spent 30 years trying to develope DRUGS to Kill cancer cells..

CANCER IS an INFLAMMATORY DISEASE

IT CAN BE CURED BY YOUR BODY WITHOUT DRUGS IN 45 DAYS !!

HOW ?

STOP INFLAMING THE BODY ! DUUHHH !!

STOP EATING ALL OIL !!!
1142 2018-05-14 21:23:09 I always thought "prosperity gospel" was too kind a phrase for that brand of snake oil…
1143 2018-05-14 21:23:02 oooooh just pulled the coconut oil out of my cupboard and it’s a little melty... summer is here
1144 2018-05-14 21:22:50 Of course it would get cloudy right when I go out to tan and use the last of my tanning oil(,:
1145 2018-05-14 21:22:46 I’m using my moms emu oil shit every day now I’ll let u know if I can see myself in an iPhone camera without barfing in a few weeks n if u truly can believe the hype
1146 2018-05-14 21:22:39 Hand santizer isn’t the same as washing your hands with soap and water. I’m not sorry. Dirty and oil is still embedded in your skin.

1148 2018-05-14 21:22:07 How much tax money goes into extraction it costs money to make money and it isnt gov money being used. If it was you would have reason to be upset. Other countries have national oil companies assume all the cost and the risk along with all the profit.
1149 2018-05-14 21:22:03 if i put coconut oil on my butthole bam u got an almond joy
1150 2018-05-14 21:21:55 That is a spout for an oil can!
1151 2018-05-14 21:21:54 If this is true, it is scary. There is genuine problem of muslim societies struggling to come to terms with modernity. But to mix it with the oil politics and Israel issue, and supporting armed rebels against regimes leads to civil wars and blocks any chance of real reform.
1152 2018-05-14 21:21:34 I’ve been looking to carry some in my office. They have massage oil too. It’s hella expensive tho.
1153 2018-05-14 21:21:15 Someone called me an 'essential oil wizard' today. I couldn't feel more touched. 

Except that I'm a witch not a wizard.
1154 2018-05-14 21:20:49 Can news sources stopping beating up on Tesla? Car crashes happen all the time but because Tesla is creating something that big oil companies hate this is why Tesla crashes headline 24/7 even if it results in minimal damage
1155 2018-05-14 21:20:47 You don't support Alberta Oil, I won't do business with you.
1156 2018-05-14 21:20:47 @BoniestAmoeba has been getting his oil changed for almost 5 hours... 
1157 2018-05-14 21:20:41 Maybe planned parenthood is snake oil #UnbelievableExcuses

1160 2018-05-14 21:20:04 He should at least threatens to release oil from his tweets
1161 2018-05-14 21:20:01 twitter is an art form but instead of "oil on canvas" it's "utter horseshit on timeline"
1162 2018-05-14 21:20:00 I GOT MY CAR BACK AND RUNNING!!!!!! Got a new battery, tags and insurance and am now waiting on an oil change!!! Next is to get 2 parts replaced and new tires!!

I did all of this BY MYSELF!! I am ecstatic! It's been over a year since I've had my girl and I finally got her back!
1163 2018-05-14 21:19:59 You use CBD Hemp Oil. I’m new to this and thought there was CBD Oil and Hemp Oil. The difference being CBD Oil is made from regular Mary Jane and hemp oil from in industrial hemp seeds?  Just looking for some enlightenment;) THX
1164 2018-05-14 21:19:54 LOLZ, the "UK bargaining power on our side" Have they not seen Brexit, or the size of their oil fund compared to the UK debt?

1167 2018-05-14 21:18:48 #Moron45 is looking desperately for a war. Since the swift Kim Jon Un outsmarted the #dotard he's looking for any other excuse for war. Needs to move usa oil and the weapons business.... or Jared trying to pacify and #Moron45 undermining all. It makes no sense. Moron looks4war
1168 2018-05-14 21:18:47 Man. Since I spent a few days oil painting, I have kind of been avoiding my computer.
1169 2018-05-14 21:18:28 It's simple. They know they can do it and get away with it. Just like crude oil's run up in 2007. What changed to justify oil at $145? Nothing. But once again they know they can do it and get away with it.
1170 2018-05-14 21:18:20 Applying coconut oil on lashes is tricky. My vision is suddenly blurry
1171 2018-05-14 21:18:20 I use cannabis oil for pain. The raised eyebrows i get when I tell people confirms although thinking is changing we are unfortunately a long way away. That's before taking into consideration the loss of profits by drug companies
1172 2018-05-14 21:18:08 Hey if a tanker catches fire and it is not put out in time can it explode because of the oil
1173 2018-05-14 21:18:02 Hi Alex, thank you for your reply. As my colleague stated previously the price changes in crude oil are out with our control. 1/3
1174 2018-05-14 21:17:48 The US also subsides oil companies who sell to foreign countries. What's your point. The US didn't pay to install those batteries, Belgium did.
1175 2018-05-14 21:17:38 I’ve struggled with bad anxiety for over half my life- been in several different daily meds for it over the years. I have been anxiety med FREE for 7 days and can’t tell the difference. Love more natural ways! CBD oil for the win 
1176 2018-05-14 21:17:18 no it's ok! i'm glad to get any recommendations just so i know what works for people. the seaberry oil is one i've looked at, fresh is a company i really love
1177 2018-05-14 21:17:13 I’ve come across the essential oil but I don’t think I’ve ever seen the actual plant! Good to know it helps headaches! 
1178 2018-05-14 21:17:08 Hey MolASSes I'm sorry I cancelled your appointment for a booty rub but I couldn't import that much oil at such short notice
1179 2018-05-14 21:17:04 Just got back from watching The Quiet Place. Cracking film. Very intense.
Talking about the quiet place i wonder how The Oil Parade went? Very quiet i expect.
1180 2018-05-14 21:16:59 Was is worth for that, to move with the US Embassy in Israel? Was it reasonable? What for? To provoke Arabian people and to activate the conflict in this region? We should work for peace not throw oil on the fire like #Trump does.
1181 2018-05-14 21:16:58 They are patriots - reporting on your INSANITY. Why don't you tweet us more info on the "brokerage" deal which Putin gave you in regards to QIA & Rusiian oil? If we know, Mueller knows- so buckle up, buttercup!
1182 2018-05-14 21:16:50 Big S/O to my madrina for the oil change 
1183 2018-05-14 21:16:48 Cantu leave in and coconut oil
1184 2018-05-14 21:16:46 Soaked my hair in olive oil for ages and now my hair is ducking amaze
1185 2018-05-14 21:16:26 @elonmusk Any efforts by industries Tesla disrupts are pointless. Oil/ICE etc simply want control to slow the inevitable. Self serving BS.
1186 2018-05-14 21:16:21 Oil... well oil and opium is what I think. No other reason for us to still be in the Middle East.
1187 2018-05-14 21:16:14 we have a snake oil salesman for a coach, only the FMF would hire him ! sucked with Puebla, sucked with Chi, sucked in Brazil... but yeah hes going to make Mex team better
1188 2018-05-14 21:15:55 people who say essential oils don’t cure cancer are just doing it wrong. you’re not supposed to drop a few drops in your bath. you’re supposed to chug a gallon of that good ass birch oil
1189 2018-05-14 21:15:13 These poor people don't have oil, so America see no value in human life...
1190 2018-05-14 21:15:07 Oil circa $78.50, M/East tensions up (on Jerusalem US Embassy news)

...not about the Fed hiking to infinity
1191 2018-05-14 21:15:02 The blame lies not with Netanyahu & Trump but with the Saudis, the Emiratis who would rather sell oil , buy football teams and build fancy resorts than use their financial wealth to pressure the world to treat Palestinians better.
They'd rather sup with the devil Shame on U #Gaza
1192 2018-05-14 21:14:55 So many good ways to eat it! I also like chargrilled with olive oil, lemon and Parmesan, or with a boiled egg 
1193 2018-05-14 21:14:38 Its been a long day y'all
It would be really satisfying if we could just take our spine out, oil it, crack it and then put it back.
Fixed.
1194 2018-05-14 21:14:36 Crypto currency world is waaay too full of charlatans selling snake oil right now. Pseudo intellectuals who think their projects are worthwhile fleecing the general public. Stick with #Bitcoin.
1195 2018-05-14 21:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
1196 2018-05-14 21:14:31 I make my own. Buy some raw peanuts, roast them until really brown and then blitz them. You’ll probably need to add a bit of salt and oil of your choosing
1197 2018-05-14 21:14:26 NET WONT NUKE IRAN BC NET WANTS IRANS OIL. WILL STRIKE SECOND TIME TO ELIMINATE ENEMIES. CAN NOT STRIKE SAUDI BC OF BIO’S. THE BIO’S ARE PRIMARY WEAPON FOR THESE CORRUPT GOVS TO WIN THEYR WAY OUT OF THEYR SELF MADE DISASTER .
1198 2018-05-14 21:14:11 Each night I try to sleep peacefully without the anxiety of what tomorrow holds.

It has honestly been the best skin-clearing remedy after coconut oil 
1199 2018-05-14 21:14:07 CBD oil rocks; my 60 year old sister who shames pot tried it and couldn’t believe how it helps her chronic pain
1200 2018-05-14 21:14:01 Difficult situations are unavoidable when one marries into a family way below his or hers. Water & oil just don’t mix, no matter how hard you stir. In the end, oil rises to the top. There are of course exceptions 
1201 2018-05-14 21:13:58 It's like I will buy this beard oil. Let me grow this my small goatie. As the thing has refuse to grow by itself. 

I've tried. 
1202 2018-05-14 21:13:40 We’ve been getting MCT oil at the Bulk Barn. A tbsp of that and a tbsp of peanut butter to smooth the texture out then blend that shit 
1203 2018-05-14 21:13:36 Hahahahaha City has the most mins for u-23 players. Yeh eh....they were all BOUGHT for 40-70mil haha. Not one youth player has come through since the oil men bought you out almost 10 years ago. Cheque book winning club.
1204 2018-05-14 21:13:19 Keep tweeting - but it will never change the fact that you are a greedy, dishonest, unethical, science denying, big oil/chem/gas/coal purchased, sneaky, cruel, paranoid, planet polluting VILLAIN, and that history will remember you that way. #BootPruitt.
1205 2018-05-14 21:13:07 paid my car insurance, got my oil changed, tires rotated, and a wash. life’s goooood
1206 2018-05-14 21:13:01 Fredo’s suit game was worse than GOAT Olive Oil Eyes
1207 2018-05-14 21:12:59 cuz the elites that own the media also own oil...and they'll air the sh*t out of a tesla crash or any electric car crash.. I still remember when Prius was getting crap for the brakes thingy (that I think was made up)
1208 2018-05-14 21:12:49 basically super inflation because the prices of oil crashed a few years ago so they starving one banana like $500 or something I’m bout to post the video
1209 2018-05-14 21:12:46 Tonight’s Grilled Flatbread Pizza

1210 2018-05-14 21:12:18 Meanwhile we've been burning cities to the ground, forging metals with open hearths, and burning wood and olive oil for warmth and light  for millenniums.
1211 2018-05-14 21:12:03 I made mayo in home and has whole eggs (not just the yolks) garlic vinegar lemon juice and olive oil. That's full of nutrients.
1212 2018-05-14 21:11:44 i'm with you on that one. but i also dump cheap probably fake truffle oil on things whenever i have it so take my thoughts with a grain of salt
1213 2018-05-14 21:11:34 Rise without fear - or have you forgotten the gulf oil spill?
1214 2018-05-14 21:11:32 WHAT. Oil diffuser!? Oh man. That’s my jam.
1215 2018-05-14 21:11:16 It's summer when your coconut oil is completely melted.
1216 2018-05-14 21:11:11 Mr. Ambassador, if you take into consideration oil production and the total population. The result is worst,  in 1949 = 4.8 million. Today 2018=32 million. The revolution (Twenty First Century Socialism)  is driven Venezuela people to misery and no future.
1217 2018-05-14 21:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: moist crust with damp motor oil and egg.
1218 2018-05-14 21:11:03 Good timing with Caspian Energy Forum due to start soon.
Great to see Georgia becoming self sufficient in Oil and Gas.
1219 2018-05-14 21:11:00 They vary in price. Mine also has a oil diffuser built in and other features so cost about $500 but you can get them cheaper. Joel also has LifeX lights that he has programmed to do this and they cost about $100
1220 2018-05-14 21:10:50 $ES_F $CL_F $USO oil rigs not looking too friendly for bears here
1221 2018-05-14 21:10:43 @elonmusk The People love Tesla. A PR tour where you spell out the efforts of Oil, ICE, etc would help. Battery storage/power is inevitable.
1222 2018-05-14 21:10:31 Think I will do baked chicken, garlic & olive oil pasta and mixed veggies...hawaiin rolls. Since I can't have mexucan food every night....
1223 2018-05-14 21:10:21 I thought this interesting on the $OXY call that the stock languished in the $60s for at least a year and after reporting earnings at a 52 week high with oil the highest in a while, will now reinstate its buyback program!  Now!? Huh??
1224 2018-05-14 21:10:08 RT @LivingSafely: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this May? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.

1226 2018-05-14 21:09:59 Sliced courgettes with some soya slice, olive oil and a bit of paprika : ) cook them for 15 minutes : ) Italian style : )
1227 2018-05-14 21:09:44 I pakai TBS Tea Tree mmg x sesuai for like a month to two. takde apa perubahan but pedih je lebih. so maybe it depends rasanya. tak semua orang sesuai. but i would like to recommend the tea tree oil botol kecik tu. mahal tapi its good tho. kecutkan jerawat. toner & cleasner bese2
1228 2018-05-14 21:09:37 Can’t believe the baby oil trick for taking fake tan off actually work 
1229 2018-05-14 21:09:32 Drank literally no water yesterday yet my skin was still nice THANKS CBD OIL
1230 2018-05-14 21:09:28 How many you had since we had oil money?
1231 2018-05-14 21:09:22 Only if it adversely affects the oil & gas guys. Then, the fur will fly.
1232 2018-05-14 21:08:55 Not cheap, property prices relatively high, but current oil price makes it a buyer's market @ the moment, weather relatively dry but coldish compared to rest of uk, good shops in city centre shopping malls, green & leafy city, lots of social attractions. Very good universities
1233 2018-05-14 21:08:47 aaaand powering the car from oil/gas burning...next...
1234 2018-05-14 21:08:38 So far since the late seventies, most (half?) of our wars are about controlling oil. We need to get off oil (fossil fuels).
1235 2018-05-14 21:08:22 @AholdDelhaize Love your products.  Can you please stop putting whole sesame seeds and cumin in your classic hummus?  It should only have: Tahini, Chickpeas, Lemon juice, Garlic, Olive oil.  While the seeds are a nice visual effect, they can get stuck in a person's colon.
1236 2018-05-14 21:08:20 Hubby and I are here at buckeye Nissan getting a oil change. Hopefully won't take long at all.
1237 2018-05-14 21:08:18 There are no aging issues or weekly costs associated w a gun. If cared for properly a gun costs 5c in oil and 1 rag per year.
My dog cost me $500 just last week.
1238 2018-05-14 21:07:58 @hodgman @JesseThorn FYI, I just arrived at the dealership where my 19yo son has a summer job changing oil. I was due for an oil change. I rolled in, he stepped up with the clipboard. I looked around and asked for the Kung Pow Chicken.
1239 2018-05-14 21:07:41 That’s German.Warm potatoes with bacon-oil-vinegar dressing
1240 2018-05-14 21:07:36 If my funeral is anything but lighting my body on fire in the middle of a giant pile of wood and oil while everyone watching is tripping, I’ll be very disappointed. This is what life insurance is for, right?
1241 2018-05-14 21:07:35 Remember when the US conspired to take over the Middle East by any means necessary. Including Trump colluding with Russia and making deals with China so they wouldn't get in the way when Bolton decided to invade Iran and take control of that oil rich nation.
1242 2018-05-14 21:07:27 There's absolutely no reason sports teams should get a cut of sports wagering revenues - do oil companies get a cut when I bet on oil - total joke.
1243 2018-05-14 21:07:25 Not to worry, because the boss, Comrade Putin is the big winner with higher oil prices. Putin is getting an excellent return on investment for buying trump and the GOP

1253 2018-05-14 21:06:22 @CNBCFastMoney @timseymour we did boost some retailers because of low oil. Just been a while. Maybe we forgot. Wen up 170% last 5 years. For 1. @MelissaLeeCNBC good point. Coupled.
1254 2018-05-14 21:06:13 Here's another fun comparison--go on Fox News, lie through your teeth, dangle a teeny tiny lil carrot like, say, a miniscule tax cut, but then BLAMMO! artifically drive up the price of oil so that we pay at the pump intsead. Have fun!
1255 2018-05-14 21:06:12 @RevBeccaStevens  I see that @thistlefarms has lavender essential oil but I also need peppermint and eucalyptus so that I can buy only from @thistlefarms. Is that coming?

1259 2018-05-14 21:05:43 You don't talk at all about Chavez's 21st century socialism. The price controls on goods. The expropriation of private industry. Venezuela was starting to have food shortages when oil was still $100 a barrel. The erosion of democracy and free press didn't start with Maduro.
1260 2018-05-14 21:05:40 No whiskers!?!? That's horrible. Fish oil def can't hurt skin & coat, but won't help with a food allergy. I'm a trainer & owner, not a vet, I always defer to vets first!

1262 2018-05-14 21:05:23 Pigouvian tax on oil production seems like a decently controllable decelleration into the withdrawal stage atm.

1265 2018-05-14 21:05:16 SIPRI ignored facts that Russia had planned those cuts for years and based on $42/bbl oil... true figure is 7%. Not only has Moscow broken virtually every arms control treaty on the books, it now has over 20 nuclear programs underway, not six.

1268 2018-05-14 21:04:44 My original, larger point is that unlike crypto or art, oil is a commodity with complex dynamics on the demand AND supply sides. It's not purely about speculation and sentiment.
1269 2018-05-14 21:04:25 Pleaseeee.. what a comparison!!   Must remember Hammad was created by Israel State! Won’t be v surprised if they also created Daesh / ISIS... it all adds up!!

1304 2018-05-14 21:00:00 America and their allies clearly want war in the Middle East, fanning the flames as usual.Looks like they want a big one this time, with Israel, Saudi Arabia ( that’s why we keep selling them arms ) Syria, Iran and some big guns and lapdogs waiting on the sidelines.

1305 2018-05-14 20:59:51 Fee of .5% and value increases as oil prices increase. Hence, violating of Iranian deal@pushed oil higher.
1306 2018-05-14 20:59:33 I've given it to cats, dogs & horses. Dose by size, if using human vitamins, start w/smallest dose avail (mgs), squeeze on food. Medium dogs can take 2 - 3 times that amt Good for skin & coat, constipation & hairballs too. Coconut oil is also safe & effective for skin & coat.
1307 2018-05-14 20:59:29 #iVoteBTSBBMAs @BTS_twt palm oil can be found in so many processed foods. but if you look at the ingredients you can buy palm oil free foods and help save the planet
1308 2018-05-14 20:59:24 @potus Looks like U.S. Oil production is of little comfort to Americans. Pump prices are rising as is always the case near summers start. Press is saying, oil shortage. Its a real shame as to how Petroleum, abroad and domestic, rapes decent hard working Americans.

1321 2018-05-14 20:57:45 ive been at the mechanic for 2 freakin hours i’ve been trying to get this oil changed for 2 freaking weeks why the hell does the universe hate me
1322 2018-05-14 20:57:29 Hmmmmm. One week's worth of clothes, travel kit including beard oil, tablet with enough space for "books," & a laptop? Shoes seem like the biggest problem but 2 pair are possible. Or is the whole family going? If the latter, you are so screwed. ;)
1323 2018-05-14 20:57:27 I found out that I have a fatty liver and diabetes, but the interesting fact is that it could be linked to cooking with Canola oil the past few years. This is why I gained 20 lbs so quickly.

Only Olive oil from now on.

1327 2018-05-14 20:57:10 Watching your video now, have you ever tried to use almond oil or argan oil (pure ones)on your scalp and sleep with it and wash it the morning once a week, it might help to make your natural hair grow longer!
1328 2018-05-14 20:57:07 “They” are trying oh-so-hard to see you fail. A vast big oil conspiracy.
1329 2018-05-14 20:57:06 Yes, there's special CBD oil for pets such as dogs & cats we carry those
1330 2018-05-14 20:57:05 Thank you! I have to try more of your stuff, ordered your primer oil for my bestie as well ^.^
1331 2018-05-14 20:57:04 I’m sitting here thinking... I realized I left my tanning oil in someone’s car last year 
1332 2018-05-14 20:57:02 It’s funny how Republicans like to do things that makes oil prices go up, and they deny climate change. So strange, why would they do that?? Hmmm
1333 2018-05-14 20:56:44 Screw him.  He has barely been an ali. Erdogan is more interested in being an extremist society that lines his pockets.  Check the oil coming from isis in Syria to Turkey being sold by turkey.  Eg profited from the war.  Give the Kurds their homeland “Kurdistan”
1334 2018-05-14 20:56:32 Smells like pink lotion and olive oil 
1335 2018-05-14 20:56:31 In all the 18 months he's been in office he's done nothing to get the insurance companies to compete , get people jobs, nothing about better wages, no infrastructure. All he has done is given huge tax breaks to the wealthy, & $$$ to Big oil & more military weapons.
1336 2018-05-14 20:56:13 Literally every time I go to get an oil change I some how finesse them into giving me like $20 off. 
1337 2018-05-14 20:56:08 Yes it’s what it was. Have to say better in traffic, and with near 200 bhp pulls like a train. Got it from a quality used car dealer in Stone near Stafford. Audi was drinking oil, front wings were bubbling so it had to go. Had a better day today?
1338 2018-05-14 20:56:04 The Syrian situation was created by Obama and Hillary, which created a vacuum for ISIS to gain power, who were aided by Obama administration. It was all about regime change. Think Gadaffi and Sadam Hussein. Troubles in ME is all about the oil.
1339 2018-05-14 20:56:01 Yep, check out the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000.  Mandates export of food, medicine, and medical devices in jurisdiction-based sanctions programs. Partly a counterpoint to the disaster that was Oil For Food.
1340 2018-05-14 20:56:00 One time I was at work and this girl said “I can just smell the Coconut Oil in your hair” 
1341 2018-05-14 20:55:56 Has she been talking to my 12 year old? Try buying biscuits or sliced bread without palm oil (Choco Leibniz here we come). I admire their stance but it doubles  my shopping time reading ingredients labels.

1348 2018-05-14 20:54:34 This for example, is why UK drivers are now paying thro the nose at the pumps: Russia's Rosneft, world's biggest listed oil biz by output, saw its profit rise 7-fold in 1st qt, lifted by rising & manipulated oil prices @HowardCCox @Kirstene4Angus @halfon4harlowMP @steve_hawkes
1349 2018-05-14 20:54:29 Oh don't worry already ahead of you on that one pal. Our State oil company "Statoil" is changing name due to the word Oil in it and seeking to remove Lal oil with renewable energy.
1350 2018-05-14 20:54:28 CBD oil is really great for anxiety! We have some pretty strong dosages that makes you cool off and be fully relaxed
1351 2018-05-14 20:54:22 i love the feeling on my skin after shower. how the flowy loose shirt feels. putting coconut oil gently on my towel dry hair. smelling like flowers and almond milk. feeling so light and clean
1352 2018-05-14 20:54:16 Perry is a POS. With the administration pushing a war in the middle east, even though we have huge reserves of oil, the admin seems to want to go back to the 1950s instead of helping alternate energy sources.

1355 2018-05-14 20:53:34 My grandfather was one of those men who came back from the Vietnam war. He also fought in the Korean war as well. I still think even if Communism was the real reason why the US really went to Vietnam then why did the supply all the oil from that country as well?
1356 2018-05-14 20:53:26 Who ever said baby oil takes your tan off “like a dream” chats utter shit it’s made it worse :))
1357 2018-05-14 20:53:17 Wouldn’t argue with that, but what sunk him was oil nationalisation, which the West couldn’t stomach.

1373 2018-05-14 20:52:05 If he'd stop taking big oil money!

1376 2018-05-14 20:51:29 A year ago oil was a lot cheaper than it is now - approx $50/barrel vs $70/barrel so that def has an impact. And there are provincial and city taxes - I"m in Vancouver, it's hell. Not sure what the feds could be doing but in Vancouver the feds aren't the problem.
1377 2018-05-14 20:51:28 You gotta show off more of that oil money Charley.

1380 2018-05-14 20:50:56 I use coconut oil to moisturise my hair and rise water. It's good to monitor your hair length each month to see results obviously
1381 2018-05-14 20:50:44 We don’t mix like oil and water 
1382 2018-05-14 20:50:41 Lmfaaaaaooo you can always spray a little oil on the chicken before you air fry it if you want your arteries to be clogged 
1383 2018-05-14 20:50:25 Why do women always try to get over us women with the cars and shit . BOY give me this oil change and let me be OUT
1384 2018-05-14 20:50:23 But it's s full meal on it's own. How do you have space for yam & oil still?
1385 2018-05-14 20:49:59 I’m excited to try CBD oil
1386 2018-05-14 20:49:56 add groundnut oil to the yam 
1387 2018-05-14 20:49:50 @johnsweeneyroar would I be crazy to think #Trump is causing trouble in the middle East thus  pushing up oil prices. Good for #russia and #America big oil producers. It's business
1388 2018-05-14 20:49:41 i currently have a mask on my face, my hair, and my feet. i am the king of kaolin clay and avocado oil. fear me.
1389 2018-05-14 20:49:35 The oil alone to do it yourself is about $25 for quality oil. Then another $6 to $12 for an oil filter. I usually watch Walmart or Advance Auto for when they have sales and stock up.
1390 2018-05-14 20:49:16 It would be really satisfying if we could just take our spine out, oil it, crack it and then put it back.- #becauseimaguy
1391 2018-05-14 20:49:15 @IMHoppingMad Can you do an episode about MMT and Venezuela? With the drop in oil prices Venezuela has printed money and they have hyperinflation.
1392 2018-05-14 20:49:11 First of all, it is not the tar sands, it is the oil sands. There is no tar. Second stay out of Canada's business.

1394 2018-05-14 20:49:02 oil is up 40% yoy, metals ($BCOMIN) almost +25% YoY, even gold ($XAU) is slightly up YoY. how does the graph falls -6,5% YoY? Overweight sugar? the roll yield, even if negative, is much smaller than the moves in metals & oil
1395 2018-05-14 20:49:00 why is everyone out of oil sheen , i don’t understand

1400 2018-05-14 20:48:06 Oil prices rose on Monday as #OPEC reported that the global oil glut has been virtually eliminated, while U.S. crude's discount to global benchmark Brent widened to more than $7, its deepest in five months.
1401 2018-05-14 20:47:58 olive oil
1402 2018-05-14 20:47:57 we need oil, even Israel understands this
1403 2018-05-14 20:47:53 God bless us with tea tree oil
1404 2018-05-14 20:47:53 Ok Tell you what. You keep the dwindling revenues of North Sea oil, we’ll keep all our revenue from the City of London by ripping up the Barnett formula. More than happy if you are. You may find that blue column shrinking quite dramatically. 
1405 2018-05-14 20:47:27 If by some weird chance they did an oil analysis on any of the previous services check those records. The metal type/content in the oil can tell you if there was odd wear on the rod bearings.
1406 2018-05-14 20:47:21 Does the recipe start with: 1lt of greek virgin olive oil?
1407 2018-05-14 20:47:01 while i was outside for literally less than 10 minutes, tank managed to get ahold of an entire bottle of vegetable oil, chew the lid off, get oil everywhere and eat the bottle!!!!! happy monday
1408 2018-05-14 20:46:43 It would be really satisfying if we could just take our spine out, oil it, crack it and then put it back.
1409 2018-05-14 20:46:34 We believe in Human Rights...unless you're not aligned with us, or we believe you're aligned with Russia, or you're not giving us oil, or you're trying to call out our corruption or corruption of our donors, but other than that, we believe in human rights.
1410 2018-05-14 20:46:32 Heroic doses of cannabis oil may be worth a shot.
1411 2018-05-14 20:46:31 I’ll pay someone to go get an oil change for me! 
1412 2018-05-14 20:46:09 So why can’t we apply that to corporations? Big oil still gets subsidized. The banks are being deregulated. Doesn’t seem much like Darwinism if they’re given more on top of they already have...
1413 2018-05-14 20:46:08 I use the shea moisture castor oil, i guess I’ll keep using it ahah I’ll try the carols daughter
1414 2018-05-14 20:45:51 I mean the foundings of Greek civilization is olive oil and wine and they invented all of philosophy and also maths so I feel good about the Mediterranean diet
1415 2018-05-14 20:45:49 It means you liberals live in small condensed areas, and somehow are arrogant enough to think your decisions are best for everyone with a one size fits all mentality, when the truth is, one size doesn't fit all: you control less of the land, the oil, the crops and the money.
1416 2018-05-14 20:45:41 Try some baby oil or some rubbing alcohol fam, that might remove it.
1417 2018-05-14 20:45:38 Only time I heard of a rod punching through the oil pan was when a dude shredded his serpentine belt, sucked the bits into the oil sump, and clogged the engine and kept driving it
1418 2018-05-14 20:45:35 OMG I never thought of doing it this way literally just sat for an hour n a half with baby oil on n nothing budged 
1419 2018-05-14 20:45:33 Now talking about lava in Hawaii. Do you even have any insights on why the market was up today? Which way the price of oil/gas is heading? Why gold is down? Or just rerunning the same stories as #foxnews ?
Disappointing...

1420 2018-05-14 20:45:23 I think I got hit on while I was getting my oil changed and my tires checked but I can’t tell because it’s been so long since a guy gave me any type of attention

1427 2018-05-14 20:44:32 No, I don't miss. But you and people like you don't want to understand that this conflict were synthetically created by the USA, UK and a small part of zionists in the 20th century. It's all about money, domination and oil. Jews and arabs are first cousins according to the Bible.
1428 2018-05-14 20:43:59 Yeah, sounds to me like they either 1) didn't change the oil at all (for like the last two times), 2) massively underfilled the oil, 3) left the drain plug open, or 4) got a ton of shit in the engine and plugged the oil pump.

1432 2018-05-14 20:43:35 I feel like the quoted tweet here implies the person just drinks spoonfuls of oil on the regular which, like, if that's your thing I'm not judging but that's weird, weird and bad and maybe learn about food, it's a superb oil delivery system
1433 2018-05-14 20:43:29 Gas prices were higher under the previous government because oil was more expensive. With oil being cheaper now you’d think gas would be too. Nope, still just as expensive and gonna get even worse. Don’t consider outside influences at all, it might not fit your narrative lol

1435 2018-05-14 20:43:16 The EPA is back in the pocket of big oil .. criminal garbage .. Pruitt should be in jail
1436 2018-05-14 20:43:15 Brent Oil climb above $78 a barrel, a price last seen in November 2014.
1437 2018-05-14 20:43:08 You do know there is a coo to defame Tesla from all OIL COMPANIES! All motor companies Chevy, ford, etc are owned by big oil. The funny thing is that all car companies know that Eletic is very violable for transportation.
1438 2018-05-14 20:43:04 Add oil and stir for a while. Leave to fry and add water.
1439 2018-05-14 20:42:50 ugh why discuss Venezuela if you're not going to talk about it's history? The USA imposed econ sanctions on PDVSA in 2011, three years before oil prices plummeted. USA had a major role in the fall of the Venezuelan economy, and you're saying they didn't? Is this journalism?
1440 2018-05-14 20:42:36 I need one of these for checking out oil tank installations. 
1441 2018-05-14 20:42:27 I wasn't listening to the interview, but I assume he was referring to the price of oil, not income from an oil source.
1442 2018-05-14 20:42:22 Considering the environment, period -- he's now allowing mining companies to dump their waste into the water supply, planning to drill for oil off the Atlantic coast (except for Florida, he's allowing companies to destroy the landscape, etc., etc.). #NotMyPresident #LiarInChief
1443 2018-05-14 20:42:18 The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that oil production in the seven major shale plays in the U.S. is expected to hit a record of 7.18 million barrels a day next month, up 144,000 barrels a day from this month.  WSJ

1455 2018-05-14 20:40:45 ok so when the manual says to use "2-3 drops" in an essential oil diffuser, apparently that means three drops will either scent up an entire house or make a single room impossible to breathe in, got it

1467 2018-05-14 20:39:51 Of course. But you're still relying on someone else to value that future cash flow when you want out. Where would you place an oil royalty trust on the Marks spectrum?

1473 2018-05-14 20:39:31 Israel, as the sole democratic and prosperous country not reliant on oil & gas in the middle east, surrounded by dictatorships pursuing an ideology of submission and hate, can never be abandoned alone by civilized nations. Wake up world! Stand up for Israel.

1477 2018-05-14 20:39:11 You can also add lavender oil to your face creams and cleanser.

1480 2018-05-14 20:38:44 It's still very suspect that palm oil goes into allegedly sustainable biofuels in Europe also. How can that possibly be sustainable? The carbon footprint of transport alone.

1482 2018-05-14 20:38:41 The world is jacking up oil prices. Also Russia and Europe agreed to uphold the JCPOA. Again Trump's withdraw from the Iran Deal is against Putin's wishes. It's a 6 party deal
1483 2018-05-14 20:38:41 This tweet was expressed to me almost 10 year ago. John completely changed my thought, not just about oil but also free trade, and all government spending is deficit spending.  Do yourself a favor, read more John Tamny.
1484 2018-05-14 20:38:36 We're killing ourselves in all kinds of ways for oil - global warming, global warring...that black slushy ooze was always meant to stay in the Earth's crust to keep it lubed as it travels & spins 30 km per second, tectonic plates moving...
1485 2018-05-14 20:38:31 Which less resources? You have recovered trillions of naira and billions of of dollars in the so-called "looted funds," plus the price of oil has been stable - what are you talking about? Your administration has never accounted for the recovered funds, have they been RELOOTED?
1486 2018-05-14 20:38:21 Don't be tricked by "light olive oil". It has nothing to do with calories, its a reference to a "lighter color and less potent taste" #fitminds

1497 2018-05-14 20:36:58 I have no idea how you can claim that. Now Iran can sell their oil and use the proceeds to spread their agenda of Middle East domination.  The return of US sanctions just makes Americans pay more for fuel. Welcome back $100 to fill your tank and increased cost for everything else

I often make a „potato salad“ with green chilies, fenugreek seeds, oil, lemon and chopped tomatoes. Everything sautéed and poured over warm cooked potatoes. Spicy and hot. Absolutely amazing!
1506 2018-05-14 20:36:20 Every winery we seemed to visit and/or drive by in the Douro Valley seemed to also grow olive trees and produce their own olive oil! Loved it!
1507 2018-05-14 20:36:14 I use expensive AF shampoo, conditioner, coconut oil PLUS 3-4 finishing/styling products. Daily. Just on my shitty ass hair alone. And it still doesn’t even look that great. 
1508 2018-05-14 20:36:03 Why does sesame oil smell like asparagus pee?
1509 2018-05-14 20:36:03 it actually had oil. XD I was shocked.
1510 2018-05-14 20:35:57 Why the oil? Other than that yes
1511 2018-05-14 20:35:52 i know the experience of people fucking with my hair because it's curly all too goddamned well if i have to deal with it from white oil money ladies for some knit hats that might be a sacrifice i have to make

1513 2018-05-14 20:35:43 Art, crypto, and oil are all ways to invest in rarity, not in an ability to "create" or produce more. I believe that's his general proposition.
1514 2018-05-14 20:35:28 Excuse me, should’ve specified, most tolerant ally. Not ones we’ve made oil deals with.
1515 2018-05-14 20:35:19 It would be really satisfying if we could just take our spine out, oil it, crack it and then put it back.
1516 2018-05-14 20:35:16 ...and it was never approved by congress, or signed by them. It was a not deal. obama sold America some snake oil.
1517 2018-05-14 20:35:12 Getting my oil changed with momma, both smirking at the same dude lmfao

1520 2018-05-14 20:35:03 It would be really satisfying if we could just take our spine out, oil it, crack it and then put it back. #funny #goofy
1521 2018-05-14 20:35:00 Its is very unfortunate Muslim Ummah having the best weapon in the form of OIL but due to Hypocrite Middle East Royals we can't use it against US and others who support illegal occupation of Palestine land.
1522 2018-05-14 20:34:55 Who wrote the ''history'' you now BELIEVE? Not the dead people you lied, invaded and murdered to regain control of the price of Saudi Arabian Oil and bankrupt America and the world with the price of Saudi Arabian oil? You salute, worship and obey the Lies you were TOLD TO
1523 2018-05-14 20:34:51 Those pipelines are to save America from sending troops overseas fighting wars over Oil. We will be able to use our own reserves making America a highly competitive opponent in Oil production.
1524 2018-05-14 20:34:50 A free oil change for some chucks you got it
1525 2018-05-14 20:34:42  "unuka I fish oil"

1529 2018-05-14 20:34:20 Highly highly recommended Pyranha fly products. They’re oil based so they last longer and they’re the only thing I’ve seen that repels the horse flies that come out in the summer
1530 2018-05-14 20:34:16 His examples were the Dutch republic in the 17th century, harnessing wind, the British empire, fueled by coal, and the U.S. with oil. Each new form of energy displacing the one before it, along with the nations that rose to power using them.
I can't do the book justice in a tweet
1531 2018-05-14 20:34:10 It would be really satisfying if we could just take our spine out, oil it, crack it and then put it back.

1533 2018-05-14 20:33:47 Need to go ahead and get this oil change
1534 2018-05-14 20:33:38 Oh so true.

I learned cricket as a lad. Yorkshire, Test matches, grass stained whites, orange wedges, sunny days and the smell of grass and linseed oil. 6 bls prr over and leisurely stroll every 6 balls to the other side

No fucking 100 ball bollocks....

It's Britain matey....
1535 2018-05-14 20:33:37 There’s nothing like a war to cause an increase in the price of oil... Trumps decision to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem is provocative, the man is a Psychopath who’s greed is out of control!

1537 2018-05-14 20:33:27 Five straight for the Dow but very dull. Highlights: 10 year Treasury at 3%, crude oil over $71, and the VIX under 13.  Breadth 1 to 1.1 and 1.1 to 1 - the epitome of dullsville. All Street denizens must be tired from the weekend.
1538 2018-05-14 20:33:17 Or tanning oil...
1539 2018-05-14 20:33:11 Well,I hope so.
1540 2018-05-14 20:33:04 You see, oil was cheap with Iran flooding the market. This was hurting Putin. So Dotard canceled it. Overjoyed at destroying the good BO did. Now Iran has a clear path to nukes. And Dotard, having broken his promises on no NK nuked ever, and Mexico pays for wall, will chicken out
1541 2018-05-14 20:33:02 Gerald you have not learned from your Dad it seems. 

You work smart. 

Smart at fleecing Canadians at every turn with more taxes, smart at killing oil industry, smart at strategical changing legislation to hang on to power, smart at divisive race, gender and religious politics.
1542 2018-05-14 20:33:01 What are R2-D2 and C-3PO's IP rating? The oil bath was shallow, and I don't think the Dagobah swamp was too deep either...

1549 2018-05-14 20:31:42 If it was all about an oil pipeline, wouldn't we do better being buddies with Iran and Syria, and just tell Israel to fuck off?
1550 2018-05-14 20:31:35 1/2 The conservatives had 44 years to make us a front runner in green energy, among other industries. Instead, our economy is still completely dictated by the price of oil. You complain about taxes but try living in any other province. Taxes pay 4 services.
1551 2018-05-14 20:31:19 I cyah go in wayne house with paint muchless ole oil...lmaoo
1552 2018-05-14 20:31:11 If the Tin Woodsman had lived a little later, he'd have found that "WD-40" is a lot harder to creak out than "oil can".
1553 2018-05-14 20:31:09 I get nervous when I get an oil change. I’m always afraid something will be wrong with my baby.

1561 2018-05-14 20:29:56 I use that brand and look like an oil well hit my hair. Not a fan of their products.
1562 2018-05-14 20:29:51 If I ever meet the person who designed where a oil filter goes on a dodge, I will punch them in the face!
1563 2018-05-14 20:29:47 Is Turley olive oil as good as Turley zin?
1564 2018-05-14 20:29:40 Oil is now being traded in Yuan as well as the Dollar.  China has set up an alternative to the IMF and an alternative to the World Bank. These things are started.

1567 2018-05-14 20:29:36 I remember reading somewhere that Saddam Hussein had an exclusive oil trade contract with France. It's why France refuse to join the Iraq invasion...read this somewhere on the internet over 10 yrs ago...don't know if my memory is serving correctly
1568 2018-05-14 20:29:22 True. Just not taking this snake oil salesman seriously.

1570 2018-05-14 20:29:00 My daughter has gone full @GreenpeaceUK and banned palm oil products from the home. I gotta eke out my last few Twirls then god knows what I’m gonna do.
1571 2018-05-14 20:28:59 If you love science then you should love declarations of conflicts on interest. What are yours? I read that you own a coal mine? And who funds Nigel Lawsons Global Warming Foundation run by oil executives?
1572 2018-05-14 20:28:55 "seize the means of production" IS the motto of socialism. I'm all for seizing private property/companies when they're exploiting the people to explode wealth inequality. Chavez relied too much on oil prices instead of diversifying exports. No one's saying he was perfect.
1573 2018-05-14 20:28:39 Best part of doing my oil change is free popcorn and drinks  blessings!
1574 2018-05-14 20:28:30 My guy I no no oo oo
1575 2018-05-14 20:27:58 Anyway, I feel very accomplished and ready to burn the midnight oil on orthopaedics 
1576 2018-05-14 20:27:57 Mossadeq wanted to nationalise the oil. He was therefore deposed as PM. The Shah took control with the help of the West, and introduced a cruel despotic regime, making the country ripe for Ayatollah’s take over which at the time was pretty popular.
1577 2018-05-14 20:27:51 おきた
1578 2018-05-14 20:27:47 We allow the oil industry to manipulate prices by cutting production when they want to drive up prices...it should not be legal
1579 2018-05-14 20:27:37 For my birthday last year, I bought a dress. A dress I love. It's bottle green and flowy and I look great in it. 
I have worn said dress 4 times. 3 of those times I have dropped food on the front of the skirt. The food is always coated in butter or oil.
This dress is cursed.
1580 2018-05-14 20:27:36 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
1581 2018-05-14 20:27:34 Howard Marks, who's usually pretty crisp, lost me on lumping in oil with crypto and art, calling them all mediums of speculation.

1597 2018-05-14 20:25:26 I know  .. but I also can cook and change ya oil wit out you taken it to a car shop so 
1598 2018-05-14 20:25:24 I always feel like a twat for not knowing what oil I get, but the guy in front of me (probably my age) didn’t even know his cell number or zip code and called his gf to ask her 
1599 2018-05-14 20:25:23 @POTUS Mr President, what is going on with the gas prices? We have more oil and natural gas than any county on earth and yet we’re paying more and more for gas. Pease address this issue. I know you can make a difference. God bless.
1600 2018-05-14 20:25:14 If you don’t change your oil in your mower every year. You are doing it wrong. And if you pay someone to change it. Yes. I’m judging you.

1612 2018-05-14 20:23:58 & this is just the start. Oil restrictions, mirror modes all to be adhered to will see the demise of @ScuderiaFerrari yet they will blame another Italian company for their poor performance as per usual. More money than any team & still fail to produce a winning car

1619 2018-05-14 20:23:21 It's all still about the oil...pipeline routes from the Caspian Sea and Iran through Syria (end run around the US 5th Fleet in Bahrain), a port on the Mediterranean, servicing US clients in the region, Saudi investment, grand (C. Asia) chessboard...but again it's all good.

We have the right to say no.

1623 2018-05-14 20:23:02 Plain filtered water is fine, I would add rose oil and lavender. I don’t know what’s in that facial spray, is it only rose water? If it’s only rose water then it’s fine.

1628 2018-05-14 20:22:20 And they approved it because it is entirely accurate. 

Hilariously, Hilsop just blocked for questioning why we don't sell oil to Asia already with our existing pipeline. 

So maybe you are right. He could just be an uninformed shill for the industry...lol
1629 2018-05-14 20:22:01 Good riddance! LA's addiction to oil money is the worst possible thing for our beautiful state! The sooner we're forced to fix our real economy and actually make things work here, instead of patching it over with energy dollars, the better off we'll be!
1630 2018-05-14 20:21:47 @OregonHempWorks was ahead of it’s time. 
Also the Indiana new CBD oil is amazing! Still trying to find a product even close in WA. Used it for my dental pain caused by the VA’s malpractice. It is . Hemp is the future.
1631 2018-05-14 20:21:45 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
1632 2018-05-14 20:21:42 #lightbulbmoment if the iran deal fall through who is going to get hurt or benefit. Europe is going to hurt, since its oil is from the middle east and it already has frosty relations with Russia. Russia is going to benefit, since its will benefit from being the only source of oil

1644 2018-05-14 20:20:52 Ling was also valuable  for its  liver, for making oil that could be used for lighting & other purposes.
1645 2018-05-14 20:20:50 Come work with me and make friends with the regulars, you receive random gifts from wholesome elders and the oil money white ladies are only a little racist
1646 2018-05-14 20:20:37 Where you think the metal comes from? I’m guessing the ground, probably dig up using machines that use...you guessed it, oil and gas.

1648 2018-05-14 20:20:33 Whole cauliflower, cut into florets, two carrots in chunks, a leek. Put on baking tray, drizzle with oil and chuck spices on (salt, pepper, random seasoning mixes). Oven at 200 for 30 mins.

1662 2018-05-14 20:19:31 Inderdaad is Shell de grote Satan en sceptici worden betaald door Big Oil. Ik denk overigens wel dat de aarde opwarmt. Het klimaat verandert immers steeds. En ik ben niet tegen beperking van de CO2-uitstoot. Maar dan moet je alle mogelijkheden openlaten, dus ook kernenergie.
1663 2018-05-14 20:19:22 things i learned in 2018 so far:
1) cleanse tone moisturise is a must 
2) Vitamin E oil is my skin saviour
3) never leave home without sunscreen and red lipstick 
4) get rid of clingy and toxic people asap 
5) trust god and go with a flow 
6) ice cream is my best friend
1664 2018-05-14 20:19:20 And that’s all fine and dandy, but you understand oil is used in basically everything. You know those wind turbines, guess what, made from machines that need oil and grease, which comes from...
1665 2018-05-14 20:19:10 Boycotting products which contain Palm Oil is surely a start? My family didn’t understand until seeing that programme; they now check items before purchasing.
1666 2018-05-14 20:19:09 Since fracking, the US has enough oil to export for profit. Why r gas prices at $4

1672 2018-05-14 20:18:04 Opinion piece from ALBERTA OIL MAGAZINE,

Vivian Krause herself is nothing but an ignorant paranoid opinion piece paid by the fossil fuel industry to clutch at pearls and feign indignation that anyone could ever have a bad thing to say about our industry.

1680 2018-05-14 20:15:38 Good Q today from a student today I didn’t know- science teachers? Why are there more natural oil deposits in some parts of the world (Middle East, Venezuela) than in others?
1681 2018-05-14 20:15:33 Check with your doctor and massage therapist about using essential oils. Citrus oils like orange, grapefruit, and lemon are stimulating for lymph glands. Peppermint, ginger, and  rosemary (dilute with carrier oil first) are good for circulation.

1695 2018-05-14 20:12:00 Oil . Oil is important for you . Not Israel. Not middle East.  Not human . 
All the leader of middle East country in fact are your leader . And all the thing happened in this area  is a map with different acter for oil .

1701 2018-05-14 20:11:26 The closer you are to crude oil,  the poorer you become. Visit communities where oil is produced and compare with Abuja and Lagos.
1702 2018-05-14 20:11:15 What? Now you are being an Azz...whether a 2-state solution may still work all depends...Jordan has land, Syria has land, Israel has land, all the Arab Soil that is so Rich in Oil...Brothers + Sisters to Palestinians would be Glad to Help..No?

1705 2018-05-14 20:11:03 Trying to find a moisturiser that doesn’t cause more oil is so hard. I think I’m going to have to bite the bullet and buy one that’s expensive that I know will work 
1706 2018-05-14 20:10:55 koong yik red oil... one application fixes the problem.
also, soaking your socks with apple cider vinegar works.
do not use these two methods... use one only.
1707 2018-05-14 20:10:45 Such bull crap. Such drivel!  The leaders are hoping for the end of days. Great! Let them all find it and leave the rest of us out of it. There, we all get what we want! The entire world would be better off without these snake oil salesmen who value MONEY, Power over true faith.
1708 2018-05-14 20:10:26 "Quality essential oils are more potent than herbs and supplements, due to the manufacturing and availability. If you want all the benefits of the essential oil, it’s important to choose a supplier who produces quality essential oils in their whole distilled form."
1709 2018-05-14 20:10:26 it’s not toxic and it doesnt in itself kill or harm birds (and preen oil is constantly replaced). problem is, mammals carry bacteria that are dangerous to birds. Surface contact wont cause an infection, but ingesting (say while preening) likely will. This is still irresponsible.

“You just gotta be all holistic n shit huh? Glade ain’t good enough for you?” 
1714 2018-05-14 20:10:03 Yes.  Read my dollar/oil commentary.  Biggest driver of oil's direction is the value of the dollar.  Oil was never scarce in the 2000s just as it wasn't scarce in the '70s.  The dollar was in decline.  Fracking only makes economic sense insofar as we wreck the USD and oil spikes.

1731 2018-05-14 20:07:55 It is clear that oil can't sustain any economy again due to its unstable pricing. Why not set up structures/legislation to tap the billions from football?

1770 2018-05-14 20:01:03 Holy crap. Guy next to me is using a broken smart phone where it looks like someone poured motor oil across all the cracks in the screen. It’s 3/4 covered in black, and there he is, trying to show his girlfriend a picture on it.

1772 2018-05-14 20:00:58 @vwcares Why can’t I find a decent dealer service dept in El Paso? First one stripped my oil pan drain plug and acted like they didn’t, and second one wants me to pay $110 for each simple problem i want to diagnose, one of which is a warranty issue. Worst service ever...
1773 2018-05-14 20:00:58 Love it ! Are you familiar with the oil that was leaked into the gulf during Katrina? Why did it take FEMA so long ? # mindcontrol #hurricanemachine
1774 2018-05-14 20:00:46 Read some of my profiles of French trams at oil free transport blog spot.

I know quite a bit about international transit. Such as French found trams have 1) higher ridership & 2) Lower life cycle costs than buses.

Le Grand Paris Express will move 1.5 bus riders to Metro

1778 2018-05-14 20:00:39 When you do a big shop, roast up a tonne of mixed veggies, with a little olive oil. Take half of it to use for pastas, salads, pita fillings etc. With the rest, whisk up eggs, pour over & bake into a frittata. You'll get around 4 or 5 meals from one bake.

1791 2018-05-14 19:59:32 What's so great about #MAGA? I guess watching innocent people be slaughtered just so trump can collect on a bribe. Rising costs of food, oil, and healthcare--not because of caring about Americans, but paying off bribes and corruption and greed! #NoCure4Stupid

1795 2018-05-14 19:59:03 SB1 funding is a set cost that was applied over a year ago. The price increase since then is the oil companies gouging us. Russia needs high oil costs so they can be profitable.
1796 2018-05-14 19:59:02 I always see all these girls running around the park by my work and all I think about is must be nice to have time in the middle of the day to exercise  i literally took time off work just to get an oil change and do some yoga cause I'm going cray lol
1797 2018-05-14 19:58:59 Hopefully this estimate will get bigger as oil price would settle around $100 per barrel for the coming years. Let's look at the half full side of the glass!

1810 2018-05-14 19:56:20 The coconut oil ones are the most perplexing ones to read. In general the results from most dietary studies are very tricky to extrapolate to different populations and expect the same results and this only sets unfair expectations on people.
1811 2018-05-14 19:56:18 But everybody forgets the last 8 years when gas prices were at $4 a gallon  oil prices always increase in the summer
1812 2018-05-14 19:55:59 Air has improved because we don’t use fuel oil for lights anymore :)

1819 2018-05-14 19:54:48 I used to think that POTUS could not directly affect gas prices but I’m having to reasses that theory. Tax cuts for the middle class will be absorbed by big oil.  But at least there will be fewer deductions. After Bush/Cheney are we still that naive to thing Trump/Tillerson would
1820 2018-05-14 19:54:46 No. The party is a deconstructive force. The supporters r a mix of the hopeless, the marginalized, fundamentalist end timers, billionaires, banks, big oil, racists and hawks.
1821 2018-05-14 19:54:28 But I know for a fact when they open up our reserves and pump more oil it drives prices down I learned that when Obama was in office in a history class bc he did that to lower prices on gas

1824 2018-05-14 19:54:11 "only another oil and financial crisis will bring emissions down, through reduced economic activity" - Economic collapse will bring emissions down but in the meantime rapid transition to 100% renewables would certainly help.

1834 2018-05-14 19:53:04 A theme of the day is that "gas prices don't matter to the economy"... you know, they tried to pass the same nonsense a decade ago and even 5 years ago... those higher pump/heating oil prices get directly extracted from household discretionary spending.

1842 2018-05-14 19:52:30 Short answer: No.  #MAGA are stuck in the uncomfortable position of having to admit their team isn't what they thought. Like been had by a snake oil salesman.  Embarrassing. Denial better.

1849 2018-05-14 19:51:50 Add sesame oil to the mix and you'll never go back to eating anything else.
1850 2018-05-14 19:51:46 Omg that would be amazing of you. I definitely did not want to use olive oil in his ears, skin maybe but not into his little ears like

1853 2018-05-14 19:51:27 The only oil analogy that makes sense. I spend billions of dollars building massive rigs to pull it from the deep sea then someone invents fracking and turns oil on its head. Old DW = rig. New DA /Elastic/spark/etc = fracking . I agree the oil is data analogy is bunk though

1856 2018-05-14 19:51:22 Yes indeed.  Hitler had a life-sized oil portrait of Henry Ford in one of his offices.  The Dulles brothers signed off on Hitler's rise to ultimate power in Germany in 1933.  Wall Street and banking interests underwrote the building of the Nazi war machine into 1942.  Etc.

1874 2018-05-14 19:48:39 US avg regular #gasprices nearing $3.00/gal. Ignoring the first week after Hurricane Katrina, first time past $3 was July '06. Crude oil price about where now. Otherwise a different world: US at peak oil imports, no shale oil, 1/3 as much ethanol, and new cars averaged 20 mpg.
1875 2018-05-14 19:48:12 Oil, vinegar, Italian seasoning and garlic salt!!
1876 2018-05-14 19:48:11 this makes sense up until fear of a US invasion. does the US find reasons to be in the middle east to exploit countries for oil: yes, but only because these countries give them an easy excuse when they say they want us all dead and blow up our buildings 
stop that no invasion wow
1877 2018-05-14 19:47:59 without oil money you needed it in the first place
1878 2018-05-14 19:47:34 There are no renewable resources that can replace oil and natural gas.  Not now.  Probably not for the next 100 years.

1883 2018-05-14 19:46:39 I actually tried putting baby oil/bio oil in my bath and chilled for 20 mins, used an exfoliating glove and oyf the tan came off so fcking easily!! JESUS
1884 2018-05-14 19:46:23 Sadly, the fat rich fucks who've made hundreds of billions on oil are going to continue to make their hundreds of billions until the last drop has been sucked from the ground. And Alberta's economy will still be chained to oil prices, and we'll be SOL in about 30 years.

1887 2018-05-14 19:45:52 Yeah because none of those countries brought hate and war to the middle east so they could control the oil. I don't agree with terrorist at all, but maybe opening some kind of dialect that doesn't end with the threat of war might help some.

1901 2018-05-14 19:44:20 Possibly, they could've just as easily sold 1500 barrels of oil. They produce over 4M barrels per day so reallocating 1500 wouldn't be difficult based on current market data.

Ok dad thank u
1904 2018-05-14 19:44:05 I have a bit of left over oils from ACMPR. I am having trouble with getting a prescription. The clinic I used shut down, then the next guy would allow no THC and then I looked at what I was paying and gave up. To buy this edible oil on the BM is possible? I am thinking gel caps.
1905 2018-05-14 19:44:04 Could be worth a shot but any oil from skin moots getting it back where it was...and potentially falling again

There is what looks like oil coming out of the blade unit?
1915 2018-05-14 19:43:18 This will never end, thousands of years these people have hated each other.  They will never get along.  #Israel #Gaza   What national security interest does the US have in Israel?  No oil.  Small trading partner.  Just get out of their way while they kill each other.

companies can label their product as "zero trans fat" if it contains a certain amount of trans fat per serving size but we all know how well people adhere to serving sizes

1928 2018-05-14 19:41:37 Nationalists everywhere are aware of this danger to their homes, they want all nations to be provinces of Judae, but you can't talk about it without Mossad gangs coming to kill you. At the end of the day they can't overcome all nations.
1929 2018-05-14 19:41:22 To take the edge off & lil relief, I use lavender oil, arnicare, salón patches & tried heating pad but bc skin is very very sensitivity to hot & cold had to squash that! Injections are a waste of time and are no good for us

1931 2018-05-14 19:41:00 Hey guys, I saw your live show and I remembered a book I read. "Who won the oil wars" the WW II would have ended in less than a couple of months if the American Oil companies (7 sisters) would've stopped supplying Hitler with oil ! They were in control of all the oil then..
1932 2018-05-14 19:40:45 Why not sell Israel real estate to oil rich Arabs and buy a chunk of northern Mexico? Move Israel to the America's. It is STUPID to have Israel in the middle East. Otherwise you people bring this on yourselves. Seems Israel is the terrorists all to often in this equation. Move.

1936 2018-05-14 19:40:22 Get off your computer, throw away your medicine and start walking. You don’t believe in basic science that -yes, cuts into oil profits so if you want to find where the money conspiracy is, it’s right in front of you. Not even convoluted...and even they admit to climate change now
1937 2018-05-14 19:40:19 #Palestine #Gaza

Israel & USA are terrorist states. All Muslim countries must boycott them and shut all their embassies there and kick their ambassadors out of Muslim countries. Stop supplying oil to US. Muslims must unite and kick Israel's ass.

1954 2018-05-14 19:38:26 There of course is a relationship between them, I said it's not 100% meaning if oil goes up X it doesn't mean gasoline goes up Y and vice versa.
1955 2018-05-14 19:38:08 Trump's relationship with the Russians goes back decades.  We just don't know the depth of the ties.  Why won't Trump release his tax returns?  What is he hiding?  Why is he trying to disrupt the oil markets to help Putin make money, while we pay for it?

1965 2018-05-14 19:37:03 To clean paint off your hands, use olive oil - it softens the paint and makes it easy to remove.
1966 2018-05-14 19:36:23 I don’t understand how I have an appointment for an oil change and tire rotation and I’ve been here for an hour and a half and they call these the speedy services... 
1967 2018-05-14 19:36:13 How much was crude oil then and how much is it now? How much was in our external reserve then? How much is there now? Compare and contrast, you would see the answer

1971 2018-05-14 19:35:41 Fracking is bad, but we will base our entire economic agenda on stripping the North Sea for oil. Yes the SNP put the environment 1st! Don’t listen to the baaad critics.

1973 2018-05-14 19:35:31 I’ve been working on the oil pastel class for Thursday. We will be working with “Aluminum panels”. Without a pastel primer, difficult and possibly frustrating. With two coats of pastel primer, nice. First pic is with primer, second not.
1974 2018-05-14 19:35:18 I feel like it comes from dipstick which is the thing you use to measure the oil levels in your car. not sure why or how it became an insult.

1983 2018-05-14 19:33:54 i don't get why israel is allowed to do this shit and the world doesn't care. I guess its because the world leaders are racist and couldn't give a fuck about the people. its all about profit margins and oil prices
1984 2018-05-14 19:33:47 "Israel has the right to defend itself"

This is the lisence they gave  to kill as many Palestinians as it so wish every time they dare protest the cruel stealing of their ancestral land!

52 dead s so far  today alone but it don't matter, their blood is  crude oil!
1985 2018-05-14 19:33:45 It's time to prepare for $100 oil. A price of $150, taking out the 2008 high, may also be a real possibility if events in the Middle East continue to escalate, as we have witnessed in recent days.
1986 2018-05-14 19:33:41 We should all be looking at ways to depend less on oil. It won’t last forever.

2032 2018-05-14 19:28:14 I had customers ask me all the time for conventional oil in their Mercedes Benz. Like bruh if your car was $80K you think a 30 dollar oil change is going to suffice?

2037 2018-05-14 19:27:40 @realDonaldTrump  Mr. President, Stop the future increases 4 Oil!  We need relief of oil price gouging & xtreme gas taxes/ California. This affect on economy, car sales, energy costs, everything unless U reduce gas prices dramatically. Screw all else,high gas prices NO1 concnern.
2038 2018-05-14 19:27:40 Hey america how about allowing another overseas company to drill for oil in the gulf of Mexico near the San Andreas Fault.
2039 2018-05-14 19:27:25 I don’t think it’s “dictating” as they are two different systems. But the “increase” taxpayers saw for a few weeks are not there anymore. Perhaps oil companies feel more comfortable raising prices? Again, just a hypothesis. Not quid pro quo.

2062 2018-05-14 19:24:07 Evangelicals are just using the Jewish people. They’ll turn on them in a blink of an eye. The Middle East is a mess because of oil and religion. It’s just a sad commentary on humanity at this point. Aristotle was wrong when he said humans had rational thought.
2063 2018-05-14 19:24:05 Only reason they're kicking Iran out of the deal is to keep their oil from hitting the worldwide market.  The lack of supply will cause price increases.  You'll pay more at the pump and banks will lend to "emerging markets" who pay back loans with oil revenue.  It's a scam.

2071 2018-05-14 19:23:04 @LastWeekTonight JFI , Venezuela may have huge oil reserves but it's poor quality, high sulphur/sulfur and is therefore not worth much relative to light crude and costs a lot more to refine. Current  $/barrel makes it nigh on worthless. $100/barrel? Kerching!!!

Someone in my little Twitter-club any idea of the gas and oil reserves in the Gaza Strip and off its coast? Like the Golan?
2114 2018-05-14 19:18:47 The national average peaked at $4.09/gallon, but there's no magic ratio that has aged gracefully since that comparison 10 years ago. Oil and gasoline are not a 100% direct relationship. It varies.
2115 2018-05-14 19:18:42 "That is the same argument being used for crude oil." Tony retorted, with a laugh.
2116 2018-05-14 19:18:32 If you draw parallels between the geopolitics , nationalism & warfare that has taken place for oil with the geopolitics, nationalism & cyber-warfare that is forming at this point around data - then it makes perfect sense.

2131 2018-05-14 19:16:58 Minor correction: Not our oil interests but his oil interests. He's done nothing to further American sensibility only things done are to fill his criminal pockets
2132 2018-05-14 19:16:57 We subsidize oil companies to make record profits, we subsidize land developers like Donald Trump who took millions of dollars from taxpayers so we could build overpriced buildings and then sued when he was no longer getting those taxpayer dollars.
2133 2018-05-14 19:16:39 I completely agree. I think it is oil-related as well (Exxon Mobil had a drilling contract with Russia. Russia has tons of oil but not the extraction technology that we have). Follow the money wherever it leads.
2134 2018-05-14 19:16:37 Trump seems to be hell bent on starting a war with the Arab world. the US oil companies which funded his election would be the biggest benefactors of the war as the oil price would rocket thus improving the profitability of their franking operations.
2135 2018-05-14 19:16:36 After dealing with my skin breaking out and not knowing why, I went on a long mission lol. It’s hard when you break out with everyone, need oil control but all need hydration so you don’t have crusty dry skin.

2152 2018-05-14 19:14:21 You're fine, no need to apologize.

33% from OPEC countries, Iran is at its core, the Iran deal helped stabilizing the price of oil. For reference see pre and post Iran deal.

2165 2018-05-14 19:12:34 Too bad the tiny bit the middle class are getting won’t be enough to cover the rise in gas prices Trump just triggered. But higher oil prices will be great for Russia- and that’s what really matters to your boy.

2167 2018-05-14 19:12:30 Become like oil ...flow smoothly & freely without “friction”
2168 2018-05-14 19:12:26 I’m weak af at “oil and water” . I thought I had one but hey you know how that goes
2169 2018-05-14 19:12:25 Solid oil report.  I love to hear that... "Rig count is higher"  Music!  Well, Olivia, beauty and brains along with useful information!  Winning combination.  
2170 2018-05-14 19:12:20 Plus I buy a 50 pounds bag of black oil sunflower seed a week for the birds and squirrels ..they only want black oil one haha  apples and accorn for the deer less in the summer the deer needs more at winter early spring
2171 2018-05-14 19:12:16 It's all part of trumps plan that has suddenly brought us respect from the entire world! Haven't you heard, it's in all the papers. I swear, this carpet bagging snake oil sales man is going to get us all killed, already has us hated by our allies.
2172 2018-05-14 19:12:11 Asparagus with 1tbsp of olive oil and some slivered almonds makes for an awesome healthy side dish to bring to a party.
2173 2018-05-14 19:12:03 Y’all I took too much MCT oil now my tummy is noooot happy
2174 2018-05-14 19:12:01 Leading to Putin & branching out over money/oil. Syrian War is in that mess, along with Iran, Russia, over competing Natural Gas pipelines through Syria, to the EU! Human life,  even yours and mine, mean nothing to Trump, ME, Russian Oligarchy. Except as fuel for war machines!
2175 2018-05-14 19:12:00 Arab Israeli conflict evolving into Sunni Shiite conflict - is good for oil prices, arm sales and corrupt leaders. Corrupt as in morally & financially. Hello Trump hello Bibi - the first will be brought down by a porn star and the later by his wife! That’s what they truly deserve
2176 2018-05-14 19:11:45 I'm still in, and still have faith in the project, just wish someone had been to PR school....
2177 2018-05-14 19:11:45 Over 60 but he doesn’t care cause brown and no oil.
2178 2018-05-14 19:11:33 Oil crisis had a huge impact on 70s high inflation. Overall inflation is quite simple: supply vs demand. Supply has factors such as cost of products and amounts of supplies. Demand is mostly based on purchasing power. Globalization favors low inflation from both supply and demand
2179 2018-05-14 19:11:26 The only reason they bought Harrods, and other property etc is because they wanted to get their feet well n truly under the table in this Country. 
Why don't the Arabs spend their oil money on rebuilding the Middle Eastern countries to stop mass migration from there?
2180 2018-05-14 19:11:13 honestly working in a grocery store can be so gross. People will buy meat and the juices leak through the packaging. oil, blood, etc. it’s so hard not to gag in front of a customer.

2183 2018-05-14 19:11:09 I can always tell when it's getting hot outside because my coconut oil becomes liquid.

2192 2018-05-14 19:10:04 Oil is definitely still the dominant energy resource in Japan, and while coal has understandably gained a bit post-Fukushima, renewables and gas have grown far faster than coal from 2010-2016 - renewables 10x faster, gas 2x faster
2193 2018-05-14 19:09:53 As long as there's discourse in the Middle East oil companies will be raking in massive profits. So Trump moves the embassy to increase tensions in the Middle East. No matter who it affects in the long run
2194 2018-05-14 19:09:50 @dpradhanbjp @FrustIndian why dont we compare rates of fuel, yes few changes in market condtn forced to hike, yet y gov patted its own back wen oil price was low in world market n in india as if they came in power so it hppnd!!! jus a few err in sayng.. but its a concern!
2195 2018-05-14 19:09:48 Ooo - you're in a feisty mood tonight
2196 2018-05-14 19:09:47 Coal, oil, and he refuses to be manipulated by shareholders. They don't care about the humanitarian/environmental benefits. Elon is a billionaire, and money is shit to him. 

They can't understan Elon Musk. He really should have never become wealthy. It was a fluke!

2201 2018-05-14 19:09:18 Good, so stop moaning.
2202 2018-05-14 19:09:18 I absolutely did thank u coconut oil. Smoothest quickest shave of my life
2203 2018-05-14 19:09:14 the flex be so real. people be so quick to show off their “foreign” steering wheel but their AC don’t work & they’re behind on their oil change.
2204 2018-05-14 19:09:13 You were on the right website, just not looking at the right numbers, OPEC countries are 33%, Persian Gulf countries are 17% & we're loosing bits of the 17% of Mexico.

You're correct, it's not quite 95%, but it's far above half of the oil we have. Loose 10% & we have a problem.

2208 2018-05-14 19:08:32 @LushLtd can I take a moment of your time to applaud you on your time and effort spent in removing palm oil from your range? Great work! Save the orangutans! #orangutans #tigers #elephants
2209 2018-05-14 19:08:31 I give up on my mower. Has new gas. Has oil. Filter is clean and spark plug is fine. Still won't start.

2213 2018-05-14 19:08:17 Also, it’s not like each application of crude oil requires the same oil. It is processed into downstream variants depending on application. 

“You need entirely different types of oil for each application; it’s highly specific”.
2214 2018-05-14 19:08:13 You guys are some flip floppers...flippitty flip flip flop flop. Some stories go this way today.  That way tomorrow. PLO's dying today. FAKE Christians causing wars. Russia, Syria, Iran teaming up in defense to save their oil.

Que: Oil

Lmaoooo done
2217 2018-05-14 19:07:56 Of course we don’t. We blow them up for attempting to change their oil trade currency to anything other than the US petrodollar. Blowing things up for any other reason is just silly, am I right?
2218 2018-05-14 19:07:55 My car is getting an oil change and I’m so happy. Like my child has a cold and is it at the doctor

2243 2018-05-14 19:05:49 McCabe does fall into rhetorical trap on oil trains by referencing Pilgrim Pipeline. Pilgrim is an outrageous concept and will likely not see the light of day but certainly  the solution for oil trains is not to build pipelines.
2244 2018-05-14 19:05:45 Aloe vera gel for the burns then if magkabald spot ka, castor oil agad mumsh.
2245 2018-05-14 19:05:34 Higher gas prices and eventually another blood for oil war, PTSD and suicide for soldiers... we're doing the most "American" thing, as usual.

2247 2018-05-14 19:05:11 where I dey go b4? Oil bloc sharing na scam, fuel subsidy na scam! The Pandora's box just opened! Politicians are all thieves
2248 2018-05-14 19:05:09 The whole point of Trump "wagging the crusades cross" AND reneging on the Iran treaty is to keep the price of oil high to bail out Putin's ailing Russian economy. Price of Trump & his GOP Oligarchs' Rosneft Oil stock is up 33% since April 9, 2018.
2249 2018-05-14 19:05:09 I'm really loving my new shea butter, jojoba oil & green tea gro oil. it smells wonderful, I may start making my sissies start using it.

2252 2018-05-14 19:04:59 This Navy Chief reservist has no anti-terrorism or national security policy experience from a strategic or operational level. He is a fraud... a snake oil salesman. Quite embarrassing actually.
2253 2018-05-14 19:04:54 This peppermint oil in my head got me feeling like a whole fresh mint
2254 2018-05-14 19:04:53 @GeorgeWill You certainly got mileage out of oleaginous. I define the word as #1 may be considered a positive when describing olive oil; #2 never considered a positive when describing a politician. (You alone have driven people to pick up a dictionary. That's a mighty power.)

2259 2018-05-14 19:04:22 i thought you checked the oil level tho :o
2260 2018-05-14 19:04:13 There's a reason places like China are investing in Solar energy and less in oil while Trump doubles down on dying coal industry and raises taxes to prevent renewable energy.
Live in the past, get left behind.

2263 2018-05-14 19:03:44 Watch them flood the oil market to fund their activities and then watch out fuel prices plummet!
2264 2018-05-14 19:03:39 I agree with what you are saying but is there not a carbon "tax on oil sands operations that should be used to help bring down emissions in that area. I'm an ordinary citizen and not an expert on anything to do with operations in the tar sands. Trying to gather info tho.

2267 2018-05-14 19:03:16 Sen. Weinberg asks about oil trains and emergency response plans. McCabe defers to federal response but NJ Legislature needs to take action to mandate emergency response plans at the very least. Oil trains are an environmental and safety threat
2268 2018-05-14 19:03:09 These two were wrong for each other from the start, a case of oil and water
2269 2018-05-14 19:03:04 I found out if you cook french fries in a pan with oil it makes hash browns.
2270 2018-05-14 19:02:59 I have a solution for this get us off of oil in a couple years.
2271 2018-05-14 19:02:58 Yeah get the Jamaican black castor oil from the store, they have hella different kinds, I normally get mango, original or peppermint.
2272 2018-05-14 19:02:49 Especially when the Calif. oil fields are far more polluting
2273 2018-05-14 19:02:48 /2 further still to incentivize longer-term risk-taking and field spending among a much wider array of Oil and Gas co's - including NOC's
2274 2018-05-14 19:02:41 That is the Golden Mine for oil spread traders.
2275 2018-05-14 19:02:30 Bro do they have the castor oil one ?!
2276 2018-05-14 19:01:58 Interesting, with the caveat that what you are essentially testing is how various types of oil under various types of conditions will behave in a test tank, as opposed to, say, anywhere along the BC coast.
2277 2018-05-14 19:01:50 I accidentally shaved my whole face and now I’m viciously putting castor oil on it to undo this tragedy
2278 2018-05-14 19:01:41 I haven’t tried castor oil. Maybe I’ll try that.
2279 2018-05-14 19:01:40 lol not me
2280 2018-05-14 19:01:24 The global Oil Service/Supply sector is barely profitable at current oil price and activity levels (after massive cost-cutting).  Look at reported earnings among public co's-mostly still weak. Without long-term ROIC in this sector, there is no oil business. Oil prices must rise
2281 2018-05-14 19:01:22 @blueapron sends you eggs! You only have to have olive oil, salt and pepper! I love them
2282 2018-05-14 19:01:18 #StateOfAmerica I think it's quite simple & I hope someone follows the money trail.
What if Trump & friends shorted ZTE, then went long ?
Is it too far-fetched that they shorted AMZN before he viciously attacked the company ?
Oh... & why is oil at $70 ?
The list goes on & on...

2285 2018-05-14 19:01:12 And the cost of oil actually decreased!!! How does this make any sense?
2286 2018-05-14 19:01:08 So we should ignore obvious truth and appease them? Three Presidents of two terms each and we are finally taking a stand. About time.
2287 2018-05-14 19:00:54 Maybe. But what do oil producers then do with their Yuan?

2292 2018-05-14 19:00:37 You disagree w/ me, & I with you. & you now are repeating. My point: coal & oil have a limited future. My red district (but blue state) has a surprising number of homes, businesses, & govt facilities that already have invested in renewables. We will join them this summer. :)

2303 2018-05-14 18:59:35 Get this shit off my feed. No one cares about Man City. No amount of oil money will change that.
2304 2018-05-14 18:59:28 Did you know? Marijuana-based CBD is generally going to have more THC and other cannabinoids. CBD oil does not contain THC (the compound that causes a “high” feeling). This is an important distinction that many people don’t understand. #TheMoreYouKnow #CBD
2305 2018-05-14 18:59:20 RT aumzan: 2wenty jmettle Too much oil!!!! ...it's NtokozoMbambo 
2306 2018-05-14 18:59:19 I cannot recommend the @WeledaUK oil highly enough. Also, @NYR_Official. My absolute pregnancy must-haves! xo
2307 2018-05-14 18:59:18 More interesting question is why is the presidents daughter and son opening and Israeli embassy in Jerusalem one week after he scrapped the Iran deal.Operation desert sword gearing up and this time Iran are in the cross hairs. Why? US control of oil price and Russia
2308 2018-05-14 18:59:16 But oil prices will go up, and Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and General Dynamics got shareholders to support.  Plus, we can’t have that many veterans using the GI Bill.  That would be socialism!  Got to thin the herd a little.
2309 2018-05-14 18:59:09 Strictly oil pen Brodie
2310 2018-05-14 18:59:07 Oil money effect.
2311 2018-05-14 18:59:01 You use castor oil on her? That thickens hair pretty nicely. And monthly or bi-monthly protein treatments
2312 2018-05-14 18:58:40 Good let them do so, there is oil in that country and that is all our so called allies want!
2313 2018-05-14 18:58:37 The best way to serve the public and protect our national treasures would be to fire @SecretaryZinke and hire someone who cares more about the land than his oil exec donors. #ThisLandIsOurLand
2314 2018-05-14 18:58:28 Sure, but if it messes our entire economy first, the funds to make that process happen would go away in an attempt at avoiding an economic crisis of larger scale. It is too slow of a process for us to be fine without oil today. Soon, I agree, but today, this is lethal.
2315 2018-05-14 18:58:25 Castor oil for my afro. Gentle magic for my face,avo+ lemon juice as a mask for my face and honey+ brown suger as a mask for my face. As for my body glycerine+ spirit stretch marks are less visible now
2316 2018-05-14 18:58:20 guys. my oil didn't run out my hot water tank is broken . l.m.f.a.o I don't think this week/month could possibly get more expensive idk what to do I think im gonna have to sponge bath for awhile 
2317 2018-05-14 18:58:18 Or coconut oil
2318 2018-05-14 18:58:05 Heeedu how about anointing oil
2319 2018-05-14 18:58:05 Keeping quite while Nigeria govt and British are slaughtering Biafrans because of our oil #BiafraExit @WhiteHouse @VP @theresa_may @USUN
2320 2018-05-14 18:58:01 @EmmasRectangle do you know of a dupe for the Sunday Riley ufo serum thing?? I have really bad blackheads and oil on my nose but that is to expensive for me atm.. tysm xxxxxxx
2321 2018-05-14 18:57:43  never had I heard someone say they use oil to prevent noodles from sticking
2322 2018-05-14 18:57:39 Dirty oil? Anyone ever bathed in "clean" oil?
2323 2018-05-14 18:57:25 Of course we could always ask the audience which CEO tweeted a picture of a frozen Christmas tree and hinted he was striking oil only to announce an unmitigated pile of crap just a few days later. Anyone know who that was??:
2324 2018-05-14 18:57:25 I voted No, plus it's no healthier than regular cake. Has tons of extra sugar and oil. How do I know all this? Worked in a bakery
2325 2018-05-14 18:57:05 Ya3ne ghayyath instead of calming the situation he is pouring oil on fire.. it’s bad buddy.. already the tension at its peak..#riyhom
2326 2018-05-14 18:56:57 Stay with me here:

1). Pull out of Paris climate treaty
2). Create instability in Israel 
3). End Iran nuclear deal
4). Watch oil prices  
5). Friends + Russians make lots of money

I'm waiting for the memes about price of gas on Trumps first day

@FoxBusiness @CNN @POTUS @VP
2327 2018-05-14 18:56:56 Ignoring the " brown skinned" that live within the borders of Israel? You know, the ones that vote and are Citizens. Simplistic race baiting
2328 2018-05-14 18:56:53 Oil is like no other resources. You can't grow as much as you want. If those who trade with us run out and their sources dry out, we run out too. So this is russian roulette.

But Iran won't keep its prices low after what Trump did.
2329 2018-05-14 18:56:39 We’re sorry to hear about your experience. Car Scented Oil is now sold by Kraco, who licenses the Glade name. We want to be sure you get in touch with them directly so they may learn more about your experience. You can contact them by phone at 800-678-1910.
2330 2018-05-14 18:56:36 You don't think we'll find a stretch of land to build it on? Have you seen oil pipeline projects? Pretty sure we can do it.
2331 2018-05-14 18:56:19 اللهم بلغنا رمضان وحنا بصحه وعافيه.
2332 2018-05-14 18:55:37 the tissue oil did wonders for my black stretch marks.  they still there but they light now
2333 2018-05-14 18:55:26 You should not have contacted the Russians. Putin benefits from having a conflict in the Middle East. Thanks to this, the price of oil is growing, and the Russian economy is held by the price of black gold. Moscow will betray you at any convenient moment. Beware.
2334 2018-05-14 18:55:24 Where is the ececonomy booming?  In Wa our gas at the pumps is going up.  This while oil trains run through our state with North Dakota crude.
2335 2018-05-14 18:55:12 So they've bn buying you things n u dnt tell me
2336 2018-05-14 18:55:07 Not 95% from Israel, but messing up Iran, now Israel and Palestine. These are some of our important oil trader.

An economic crisis doesn't require no oil coming our way at all. Just cutting 50% of incoming oil would double the price again and again.
2337 2018-05-14 18:55:04 @steveliesman not quite sure I agree with the latest oil rise belief that an oil increase will be a wash.

I agree, money going to U.S. oil producers is good, but whether foreign or domestic, the increases all comes out of one pocket, the consumer’s.
2338 2018-05-14 18:54:54 When I stopped using products from those silly commercials my body started to flourish. Skin got clearer, hair got healthier, teeth got whiter. Coconut oil is life and straight from the earf.
2339 2018-05-14 18:54:54 That’s why you hit it with the oil or butta in the skillet dumbass
2340 2018-05-14 18:54:52 لا اله الا الله.
2341 2018-05-14 18:54:35 and in wars that you soley fight, notice this trend, all those countries have no foreign owned banks and are "independent", they resources and mostly oil or a way to oil, and after every war do you notice that the evidence that lead to war, is proven wrong?...
2342 2018-05-14 18:54:19 If anyone has any personal experience with CBD oil or anything Cannabis oil related for real medical use please let me know. I have a bunch of questions.
2343 2018-05-14 18:54:14 Someone threw a packet of Omega 3 tablets at me .... I had super fish oil injuries
2344 2018-05-14 18:54:07 Well Netanyahu is not gonna compensate for rising crude oil prices
2345 2018-05-14 18:54:01 But girl, you can’t take your rage out on innocent bystanders: I’m not the one who hired oil tycoons to environment protection agencies, why do I have to suffer the consequences of your shit ass mood? #dontdomelikethat
2346 2018-05-14 18:53:41 For first time in Canadian history we we have a PM Chief of Staff who wants to keep Alberta's oil in the ground.
2347 2018-05-14 18:53:39 Yes, just like a car salesman! Or snake oil.
2348 2018-05-14 18:53:36 In fairness, we have a deal to sell oil to the US below market value. That's been in place for many years  (Trudeau Sr.?)
What SHOULD be happening is that agreement should be on the table for the NAFTA negotiations.  #cdnpoli
2349 2018-05-14 18:53:22 .
Really...

Without wanting to defend #Trump pouring oil into the fire, you’ve got to see both sides:

Palestinians also want the whole of #Jerusalem.
#Israel was founded as a home to the persecuted and has a right to exist.
Doesn’t justify excessive violence.

Just balance it!
2350 2018-05-14 18:53:22 Our CEO, Rodney Uchytil, visited with the management and team members from Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) this week. KOC has utilized FLC 2000® on more than 25 wells in the last six months to help solve specific drilling challenges. We would like to thank KOC for the opportunity...
2351 2018-05-14 18:53:21 Kiddo, did you know fuel is linked to OIL price? Check out how that’s moved in past 4yrs. Btw your silence on #WestBengalPanchayatElections is understandable. Congratulations also on your mum being recognised as having more $$Billion than Queen. Enjoy.
2352 2018-05-14 18:53:15 For a gov to spend trillions subsidizing coal oil & gas GM Ford etc is OK? 

Spending 500 mil to speed up advent & adoption of clean ren energy & EV is no brainer.
Do u have an answer on how to cut the cost of batteries, land, infrastructure, robots, labor & keep investors happy?
2353 2018-05-14 18:53:09 If tea tree oil can’t fix it then it’s lost cause sis
2354 2018-05-14 18:52:23 Not true. The cost of oil is determining factor. Having a surplus helps drive the oil prices down. The fact countries import OUR oil/gas prove deregulation works. If you want reduction of fuel prices petition the govt you love so much to reduce taxes on fuel. Good luck with/that.
2355 2018-05-14 18:52:15 There's nothing like firing up a barbecue next to an oil tank! I love people who live life in the fast lane!
2356 2018-05-14 18:51:53 Came across something online. Do you endorse Tanya Kim’s product “Essence of Arian” oil?
2357 2018-05-14 18:51:45 Russia needs higher oil prices for their economy.
2358 2018-05-14 18:51:42 “post Zarb e Azb target killing”
It is OK to do ‘target killing’ during Zarb e Azb because you lot were endorsing that and now the same target killing has become Haraam.
2359 2018-05-14 18:51:41 Would say the vitriol is amazing but I expected it. Policy of appeasement in NOT recognizing an obvious truth has gone on too long.  
2360 2018-05-14 18:51:36 apparently they hate Jews. Not one Dem went to embassy opening. Does the left want to continue to call Trump anti-semitic? Do the “antifascists” believe anyone is buying their fascist, racist, unAmerican snake oil? Answer: yes. problem? America needs them to stop chugging koolade
2361 2018-05-14 18:51:24 When are you going to remove palm oil from your special toffee @thorntonschocs - am sure it’s not an original ingredient and the orangutans don’t approve either!
2362 2018-05-14 18:51:23 Madness. Getting grief about supporting united because I live in Barnsley from an oil fan who lives in London
2363 2018-05-14 18:51:20 Hitchhiked: Alaska natives brought him to barrow, he then went from barrow, worked at an oil rig for a year since he had his experience, then used the meoney to buy a plane ticket to metropolis or he used his bank account to buy a ticket from barrow to metropolis
2364 2018-05-14 18:51:19 Reached "oil and goldenberg" chapter of @joekhamisi1 book. The thing with corruption in Kenya is that it isn't even smart or sophisticated or Morphing just blatant theft
2365 2018-05-14 18:51:19 So why in the world would I want to educate someone who clearly is simply a religious zealot? A believer just on faith? U have no interest evidence, in facts. If u did, understanding that US corps want Iranian oil would not be difficult for you. Good luck!

2368 2018-05-14 18:51:13 While I did my Obs/Gyne rotation with Women’s College’s high risk team, there were many more stories.  The one that that still makes me laugh was large bottle of virgin olive oil, a distressed nurse, & a husband who really wanted to please his wife as recommended by their doula!

Wel can U tell me in which language our constitution wrote? Half Bake chicken & half knowledge ppl both R dangerous 2 culture  & Society
2371 2018-05-14 18:50:46 Since I was born in Nigeria 

1. You pay huge bills for electricity 
You will be deprived. 

2. Pay for school fees, you will be denied good quality education (private schools trying though) 

3. No good roads, 

Nigeria has oil but can't refine oil
2372 2018-05-14 18:50:29 @eric_shorey whoever edits the nobodies videos deserves a raise for adding the oil rumble belt to strowman's shoulder. I popped!

2378 2018-05-14 18:49:15 paging @justinstaple - come in js put down the bok choy and sesame oil.
2379 2018-05-14 18:49:15 Thank you! The pupils cover beige sugar paper with a layer of white oil pastel and a layer of brown oil pastel then scratch away the brown layer with a wooden stick. We love how authentic the work looks as a result!

2381 2018-05-14 18:48:56 Epa Leader Scott Pruitt who has been under fire of late says he is proud of the deregulation accomplished so far and I'm sure more is to come the new Mission of EPA IS TO WHOLEHEARTEDLY PROFIT BIG OIL/GAS/CHEMICAL/OTHER INDUSTRIES NOT PPL&AIR&WATER&LAND
2382 2018-05-14 18:48:55 Josh, I went to Le Coquette and the truffle oil cocktailes cured my hamster foot syndrome (which is a totally real and not made up disease). 

I'm glad that someone is  giving this little known restaurant the attention it deserves (btw, I knew about first).
2383 2018-05-14 18:48:51 oh my GOD

2384 2018-05-14 18:48:48 I really think you might need to keep an eye on them and see if they might need to rescue her later because closure... but that's mostly cuz I'd really want it, myself, even though fey and takebacks are a bit like oil and water....
2385 2018-05-14 18:48:38 WAU! Prepood the mane with coconut oil then forgot. Now my pillow!! WAU!
2386 2018-05-14 18:48:35 Well, the most important thing is to control the oil and gas industry. If you notice, Jared Kushner said these are the counties allied for common interest: US, Egypt, Saudi Arabia with Israel. It really isn’t about religion.

2394 2018-05-14 18:47:26 The oil prices are artificially inflated to take anyone's tax refund away from them and give Big Oil a lot more $$$ than they need,this is a Conspiracy larger than anyone has ever seen in the United States history perpetrated by DICTATOR Donald Trump.

2397 2018-05-14 18:47:14 Working in oil and gas doesn't prevent you from working out that there are, for example, costs related to fisheries. Try to think objectively.

2416 2018-05-14 18:45:22 THIS IS ONE AREA I AGREE WITH KAMALA HARRIS WITH.  I did my research. We've been lied to for years about the classification of Canibus.  LOOK UP THE HISTORY OF HEMP,  CANIBUS OIL, DO YOUR HOMEWORK & you'll SEE!
2417 2018-05-14 18:45:15 And we produce so much oil, hard to take these hikes knowing that.
2418 2018-05-14 18:45:10 Perhaps, but this time people won't be in a corner of having to choose between buying oil or going without power. This time there is solar to move to.

2425 2018-05-14 18:44:43 #USEmbassyJerusalem
This tag is interesting. No one from the right seems aware that this is where 95% of America's oil come from. Ruining the deal with Iran, the conflict between Palestinian & Israelian... those will mess up the oil price.

If you didn't know, well now you know.
2426 2018-05-14 18:44:19 They use their oil money instead of giving it away.

2435 2018-05-14 18:43:20 That might make sense if Israel had oil or produced something of value for the U.S. But they dont. It's literally parasitic relationship. They get everything billions of $ and weapons, U.S. gets nothing in return but resentment and hatred from most of the world. A franchise?
2436 2018-05-14 18:43:16 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
2437 2018-05-14 18:43:16 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2438 2018-05-14 18:43:14 Romney knows nothing about Christianity. Godless oil slick.
2439 2018-05-14 18:43:10 Truly think taking my eye makeup off with coconut oil has made my eyelashes healthier and longer

2441 2018-05-14 18:42:56 I’m gonna need the Costco size vegetable oil.
2442 2018-05-14 18:42:53 19.5% of Rosneft oil was "sold"  just days after the Trump Tower Dec. Meeting. Carter Page knows a lot about it. He went to Moscow the day before the transaction to meet with Rosneft management. 19% was in the dossier as an award to Trump via Page for lifting sanctions.
2443 2018-05-14 18:42:50 The Politicians who hv been plundering Nigerians wealth since 1960 r nt a problem?! Oil bloc sharing is a scam,fuel subsidy scam
2444 2018-05-14 18:42:45 Coconut oil bc it fixes everything x

2447 2018-05-14 18:42:12 Every damn round. I prefer a natural fiber rather than something made from crude oil.
2448 2018-05-14 18:42:07 Thank you, it's just oil and acrylic paint 
2449 2018-05-14 18:42:06 I see two sides entrenched. Both having a worthy moral argument. I see one side that refuses to bargain and calling for 2nd holocaust
2450 2018-05-14 18:41:48 Yea theyre pretty solid. Still needs oil just much less.
2451 2018-05-14 18:41:37 once the President opens his mouth, Mitch Mcconnell whistles the #starspangledbanner

2454 2018-05-14 18:40:59 OIl and and auto lobbies would be big opponents. Check out what Heartland Institute, ALEC etc. and other nefarious players have to say about this.
2455 2018-05-14 18:40:56 Use Coconut oil to cook rice or beans and your neighbors will come to yours to " charge phones".
500ml is just #500.
2456 2018-05-14 18:40:54 Chained to big oil? Are you joking or just insane?
2457 2018-05-14 18:40:25 あの時のBBの言葉はスッゲー嬉しかったなー…
2458 2018-05-14 18:40:18 Gas prices rocketing as Donny ratchets up tension with his Jerusalem stunt.  US dollars to a Chinese company ZTE and to help N Korea buy Russian oil. Tax breaks for the rich increase national debt. When will Republicans actually become fiscally responsible?

2460 2018-05-14 18:40:07 When all said & done, there will be no more Palestine, only the ones left in the zoo survive. That will be Greater Israel, US taking Syria oil makes a Greater USA... do you think that is what Trump meant when he said He will make America Great!!!   2 cents for your thoughts...
2461 2018-05-14 18:40:06 Ayyyye my dad got me more oil

2463 2018-05-14 18:40:01 It’s really quite simple it’s all about money Iran has oil that equals money Russia has oligarchs they have money. China has cheap labor so people with money can make more money #BlueWave2018 by the way Israel has diamonds more money
2464 2018-05-14 18:39:53 Honestly not surprised his archaic competition is running hit pieces on it.

The oil companies do the same to solar/wind/etc.
The old motor car companies all smear electric cars.

Old money dies hard.
2465 2018-05-14 18:39:53 I wish I could put coconut oil on my emotions
2466 2018-05-14 18:39:45 These ppl families being martyred likely will be compensated as suicide bombers who kill Jews, rewarded, thus enticing more to do the same.
2467 2018-05-14 18:39:35 Supposed to be good for liver x but I would go to MMS or Cannabis oil first for most ills
2468 2018-05-14 18:39:32 They will never get peace there, its like trying to mix water and oil.
2469 2018-05-14 18:39:30 #Hemp Seed Oil is not the same as true #CBD Oil. While it’s still plentiful with health benefits, it contains very little, if any, CBD. I’ve seen some branded as Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil, which may lead people to believe it contains CBD #cannabis #MedicalCannabis
2470 2018-05-14 18:39:18 There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise, But a foolish man swallows it up.
2471 2018-05-14 18:39:18 For soup, cook cubed shallots in oil, then simmer with meatballs, chipotle, chicken broth and zucchini. Top with pesto.

2474 2018-05-14 18:39:05 Why  @realDonaldTrump and his Administration Don’t Talk about Oil & Gas Prices Rising Way UP.

Much more important than Embassy move.
2475 2018-05-14 18:39:05 Funny you bring this up. Had a friend just yesterday who works in the industry highly recommend CBD oil for muscle recovery/inflammation.
2476 2018-05-14 18:39:02 Im getting an oil change by myself wow im such an adult
2477 2018-05-14 18:38:42 How much stock do the people/banks to whom trumplethinskins owes money have in coal and oil?? I bet it is a lot more than they should in this day an age. It is time to invest in CLEAN sustainable energy!

2479 2018-05-14 18:38:39 Just heating some oil in my Trangia frying pan prior to cooking tonight’s steak & a very large moth landed right in the pan. I flicked it out but it did not survive.

2492 2018-05-14 18:36:23 No Oil for Israel. No Muslim country should supply oil to Israel
2493 2018-05-14 18:35:54 You anonit my head with oil, my cup overflows

2495 2018-05-14 18:35:50 Who knows... But even now, that there are religions, the main reason for wars is not religion, but resources (oil, gas, ...). Without those resources, this life that we are used to, would stop - simple as that.
2496 2018-05-14 18:35:46 Thanks Yas

2498 2018-05-14 18:35:32 Are they going to eat more fish caught in American waters...where Trump is expanding offshore oil wells?
2499 2018-05-14 18:35:28 She was use to putting oil in her bowls but never a straight up dab. She won’t go back to it lol

2502 2018-05-14 18:35:06 You can par boil, cover in oil, and then freeze as partly done roast potatoes - they get a bit insubstantial, but they are good for emergencies
2503 2018-05-14 18:35:02 Justice a captured soul, lets hope he didn't tea with excel oil tonight
2504 2018-05-14 18:34:51 Oil hit 72 last week..

2506 2018-05-14 18:34:35 Trump didn't invite them to riot. This is absurd. 
I don't condone everything Israel does but they are in fight for lives against
2507 2018-05-14 18:34:34 What does big oil have to do with this?
2508 2018-05-14 18:34:34 Tanker confirmed to have been carrying an unknown type and amount of oil.

2510 2018-05-14 18:34:05 Also worth noting that The Sinai was bigger than Israel itself and contained oil reserves but in return for Egypt's recognition of Israel's right to exist, Israel returned it to Egypt. (& although there is peace, textbooks still dont show Israel. 1 sided deals just like 2day)
2511 2018-05-14 18:33:48 I fell in love with an oil and vinegar store and I just need all the spices and oil.
2512 2018-05-14 18:33:41 The water source needs to be maintained frequently..  

Vehicle's oil need to be changed too..  
2513 2018-05-14 18:33:35 Curry is the best food, but it's even better with chili oil.
2514 2018-05-14 18:33:24 The end of cheap oil will be a problem, and it's flippant to assume that technology will inevitably save us. But if there's anything that can steer us through withdrawal, it's AI, for both renewables research and central planning.

2517 2018-05-14 18:33:12 @steveliesman 
Price of Oil, Gasoline and Nat Gas going up is terrible for USA Citizens the USA Corps are creating inflation plus putting the screws to USA Citizens!!! 
1) Huge Tax Cuts 2) no ocean tanker cost — therefore, all prices should be coming down not up ! #oilprice #gas
2518 2018-05-14 18:33:11 You are as if Congress never did that keeping in view the soaring oil prices in the past. If you can justify this decision when u were in power citing the valid reasons, why such a hue n cry.
Double standards!
2519 2018-05-14 18:33:09 who can forget it was the US who made big money during the Afghanistan war with the profits made by Poppy's sales in drugs.  It was interesting to see how US used Afghanistan for oil/drugs sales yet the media only talked about the Terrorist.

2521 2018-05-14 18:33:00 In a shocking turn of events: coffee tastes bad with vinegar and oil
2522 2018-05-14 18:32:57 Those oil companies need to make record profits
2523 2018-05-14 18:32:57 Reminds me of when we lived in a bog, and our next door neighbors had an 8 ft poison oak hedge.

When they realized what it was, they burned it off... not realizing that the oil simply goes airborne when you do that.
2524 2018-05-14 18:32:52 wait until oil reaches $100 a barrel this summer.
2525 2018-05-14 18:32:49 Yeah good talk my friend. And you got it. Always goes back to oil.
2526 2018-05-14 18:32:47 I give these niggas 20 min to complete my oil change
2527 2018-05-14 18:32:44 You can also fry oil with garlic. You use that oil when it's not so hot and give it to him, it works for my dog when she has an upset stomach!
2528 2018-05-14 18:32:43 Oh dear. Scotland has it's own wealth. UK hid whisky and oil export figures for years. England doesn't GIVE it TAKES. We are not going to agree. Glad to discuss without abuse.
2529 2018-05-14 18:32:42 sorry i meant 6ml of oil
2530 2018-05-14 18:32:38 ‘Intercity 125 / HST with original paxman engines’ is a subject I can’t discussing for a long time.

2534 2018-05-14 18:32:29 So do y’all really be buying lingerie to sit around being single and independent in? Or is that just Twitter’s new “water and coconut oil”? Because I know EYE am not fussing with all them hooks and snaps and ties and not getting no secks after.
2535 2018-05-14 18:32:29 I totally agree. This is likely the collapse of the empire, & maybe that’s appropriate. But it’s an interconnected world. Better for everyone if we get a legitimate government in & focus on redefining ourselves than having trump gleefully pour rancid oil on nat’l & global fires.
2536 2018-05-14 18:32:24 The only bad thing is I don’t know how to do those type of things on my own without begging them to teach me.... I have to sneak around just to get an oil change for my own car.

2539 2018-05-14 18:32:10 the fact that I’m ready to leave and I’m still sitting here with conditioner and coconut oil in my hair 
2540 2018-05-14 18:31:57 cheap and decent quality. not spectacular. feel like i pay mostly for the chili oil but i keep going back.
2541 2018-05-14 18:31:55 I’m getting my oil changed and they are definitely going to judge my car because it’s so dirty on the inside. 
2542 2018-05-14 18:31:51 Yeah idk how Saudi Arabia could be ally considering how they do business. I’m guessing oil? In any event this has been quite informative. 
2543 2018-05-14 18:31:44 True. Sad fact is majority of it ends up misused and in the hands of despots and oppressors. In this we are complicit
2544 2018-05-14 18:31:43 Trump not only invited them he gave them intel 
2545 2018-05-14 18:31:40 Yes. Didn’t he have oil interests that profited?
2546 2018-05-14 18:31:30 I shoulda had my daddy bring my truck in like im ready to go. Longest oil change
2547 2018-05-14 18:31:24 by sublingual i mean i leave the oil under my tongue for 2 minutes, because if i just straight up swallow my dose, i don't feel pain relief at all nor does it get me even slightly high at 2ml of 5mg/ml THC-CBD each.
2548 2018-05-14 18:31:20 So for a 15km road commute, mostly wax but oil when it’s wet?

2551 2018-05-14 18:30:52 Koch Bros also have their eyes on oil drilling in the Canadian Arctic. Trudeau's preventing it, Scheer would allow it. So, would Koch Bros fund CPC? Yes, coz they would cash in big in return. Turning Canada into US: lawmakers owned by big corporations, since they provide funding.

2559 2018-05-14 18:29:36 OK. What I meant to say was CBD oil should be available as medicine. Although legal it can only be bought as a "food supplement" this makes it difficult to ask about dosage etc. And yes, I do take it for pain relief.
2560 2018-05-14 18:29:31 I was assuming it was possible, but hadn’t ever met someone. I’ve seen people puke before, but that’s a lil different.

2565 2018-05-14 18:28:37 Sorry but I am slammed right now and don’t have time to fully explain it to you Suffice to say it is RUs largest oil company and it figures prominently in the Dossier and at the heart of TrumpRussia.
2566 2018-05-14 18:28:24 Old castor oil is more meaningful. These days brainless Selfie Stick is just horrible chicanery babble
2567 2018-05-14 18:28:13 Actually their control on oil prices is indirect. They are the largest oil importers because of heavy industrialisation. 
They need oil and for that they need the middle East to be under their clutches. That's why they keep on invading West Asia (Iraq, Syria).
2568 2018-05-14 18:28:09 My car needs an oil change and a DEEP detailing

I've been oil painting a lot, gonna learn the way he does things! See you there!
2572 2018-05-14 18:27:15 Context? Who here would invite Russians to set up an Embassy in the WH? You accuse me of stupidity?
2573 2018-05-14 18:27:11 I have to say that today is the first time that I ever had somebody with the fetish that wanted to rub me down with coconut oil and Waller around in it. It was both very interesting and fun at the same time! So if you're into oil wrestling I'm down for that now too!
2574 2018-05-14 18:27:10 @MODPizza your Hawaiian pizza should be this:  red sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, olive oil, bacon, Canadian bacon, pineapple, and asiago.  I don’t know if you have a prefab Hawaiian for featured pies but throw that in the trash if you do because this pie rules

2588 2018-05-14 18:23:38 Not likely. Alberta has squandered its future through proving tax breaks to oil companies. 40 years ago, it should have stood up to the oil industry like Norway did. Norway has a couple of trillion in the bank. Alberta only has a pile of debt thanks to Conservative mismanagement.

2595 2018-05-14 18:22:53 You have to actively work the mix of shampoo conditioner and facial wash into your beard. I like to go face wash -> shampoo -> conditioner. Follow up with combing and beard oil after . Oh and we usually only go up to about ear level.
2596 2018-05-14 18:22:39 Shit! I would suggest Peppermint Oil. But, I am NOT sure that would keep the smell off of your herbs.
2597 2018-05-14 18:22:32 Fuckin gas and oil lobbyists
2598 2018-05-14 18:22:32 This is the dumbest shit I've heard all day, but I have to admit I'm intrigued. How, specifically, does your body tell you that coconut oil is "the most dangerous of oil among all edible oils"? How does it convey that?

2612 2018-05-14 18:21:10 Just wait a second fellows, just when everything was looking good, tax cuts, good economy, then what happens? The greedy SOB Oil companies takes what little ahead of the game I had. Gas prices going up  a terrible rate

2615 2018-05-14 18:20:55 It’s the needlessly provocative act of an idiot, ignorant president. 

His ‘policy’ on Iran & Israel is entirely driven by US fears about oil no longer being priced only in dollars. 

Desperate acts at the end of empire.

2621 2018-05-14 18:19:51 It shrank when the price of oil plummeted. Don’t you remember? Eck promised us billion from oil in 2014 - and, guess what? - it vanished before his eyes as the price crashed.

These cannot both be true. Perhaps the author has an agenda?

2631 2018-05-14 18:17:50 Gulf states will collapse economically as they depend on oil as their primary USP.

2694 2018-05-14 18:11:13 The biggest risk that Asia's third-largest economy faces is rising crude oil prices, which hit $78 a barrel last week, their highest since November 2014 following prospects of new U.S. sanctions on Iran.

2707 2018-05-14 18:09:21 If you go to Avenatti's tweets, he tells you the times to look in the videos. Popular speculation seems to be that the people Cohen was meeting with are tied to the Rosneft oil deal. If Cohen/Trump received any benefits from this deal under the table, that would be huge.
2708 2018-05-14 18:09:00 Republican leaning Supreme Court just legalized sport gambling..more crime coming. Republican Nixon was the Rowe vs Wade President. Republican Bush began the Iraq ,war for Oil. 10s of Thousands killed for oil interests. Bush=severe economic depression. COOL?
2709 2018-05-14 18:08:57 Oil is a commodity, and one that is traded globally. TONS of factors affect the price. But Trumps horrific rhetoric regarding Iran and the Middle East in general is doing nothing but driving prices up.
2710 2018-05-14 18:08:48 While many things are at play, I think it is no coincidence that the labour force in all four provinces peaked in 2012 and 2013, just when the oldest baby boomers entered the second half of their sixties. Oil at $100 in NL for many years might change this, but not much else.

2712 2018-05-14 18:08:46 @MeghanMcCain Your father is in our prayers. Pls, go to youtube& search: (Frankincense Oil: The King of All Essential Oils?)have shown to that help fight cancer Also studies have proven that artificial sweeteners cause brain cancer. There are natural cures for cancer.
2713 2018-05-14 18:08:44 He made a lot in oil trading but the liberal media and google bury that for the hypocrite. Plus nothing Trump has done mirrors Hilter so can't Mr.Billionaire come up with something original AND factual?
2714 2018-05-14 18:08:43 Price of Oil, Gasoline and Nat Gas going up is terrible for USA Citizens the USA Corps are creating inflation plus putting the screws to USA Citizens!!! 
1) Huge Tax Cuts 2) no ocean tanker cost — therefore, all prices should be coming down not up !!! #oilprice #oil #Gasoline
2715 2018-05-14 18:08:36 Soooo thankful Luke knows how to change my oil for me and other stuff too so i don’t gota pay 81828292038 dollars at the dealership for stupid stuff at the dealership 
2716 2018-05-14 18:08:36 Hot oil treatment time
2717 2018-05-14 18:08:19 We will need to wean them off the oil gradually or their economy will fall off a cliff
2718 2018-05-14 18:08:09 Oil and gas stock $WRD still in a halt (news). Down 9.53% today.
2719 2018-05-14 18:08:09 Coconut oil > any other hair cream there is out there.

2724 2018-05-14 18:07:46 It is not oil that they hate, it is ALBERTA OIL. 
Every "environmentalist" spins this story while supporting Saudi, Russian, Venezuelan, and other foreign oil. This is politics, folks, plain and simple.
2725 2018-05-14 18:07:43 No. If hikes were declared during election it would amount to oil companies are working for Congress.
By no hikes they are neutral.
2726 2018-05-14 18:07:43 I guess you should be thankful for the arab oil money then
2727 2018-05-14 18:07:41 Yep...!  Mark on the map Poland and Ukraine too.! This is what they want fresh water, green lands, coal, oil , titan, silver, gold , money and other things from Poland. Free Palestine!
2728 2018-05-14 18:07:35 Tema Oil Refinery  CEo Isaac Osei threatening to resign is life goals my brother.. Let that sink in deep
2729 2018-05-14 18:07:25 Exactly. They want regime change but first they wan the oil.
2730 2018-05-14 18:07:07 During emotional Oil Boom farewell show, J leaned forward, for what I thought was going to be a special moment between us, and whispered into my ear “I think we need to be saving more for retirement”.
2731 2018-05-14 18:07:06 ****EXTRA BONUS**** Who benefits from higher oil prices stemming from instability created by Trump's backing out of the Iran deal? Big GOP  donors and, you guessed it, ROSNEFT.
2732 2018-05-14 18:07:06 Peace for @jaredkushner means what? Getting read of palestinians by killing them? He should resign or being impeach for putting oil on fire
2733 2018-05-14 18:07:04 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow.
2734 2018-05-14 18:07:02 We’ve been sitting at Walmart for 2 hours waiting to get my oil changed and they haven’t even taken my car back yet
2735 2018-05-14 18:07:00 If it's mundane items only, a suit of armour might be good. Does that count as 1 item though? With a backpack I could carry stuff I find...

Oh I know what I'd take: An extra flask of oil so I can cast the poor man's Fireball.
2736 2018-05-14 18:06:53 Ugh gotta get my oil changed 
2737 2018-05-14 18:06:42 Neo-liberalism has led to:-
•A widening of the gap between the very rich and the poor and failure of its so called ‘trickle down’ economic theories.
•A squandering of the assets from North Sea Oil.
•The creation of Tax Havens and Tax Avoidance.
•The Banking collapse of 2007-8
2738 2018-05-14 18:06:40 At first I wondered what would happen if Trump was prevented from lifting sanctions by Congress.

Then I realized that backing out of the Iran deal could achieve similar effect: Raising worldwide oil prices by putting sanctions on Iran would increase the value of Rosneft, too.
2739 2018-05-14 18:06:37 I think he'll be ok...lol
2740 2018-05-14 18:06:07 Have you ever worked on a oil rig, I have. 
I agree renewables are the future as long as the wind blows.

Nicola Sturgeon is the problem, you need to realise that.

2744 2018-05-14 18:05:09 Topical Bars and a VERY limited supply of Sweet Relief oil are now back in stock!

2746 2018-05-14 18:04:18 I agree Jordan Peterson is overly optimistic. Nigeria is now a net food importer and its oil revenues will not last forever, with a huge growth in car ownership and a population forecast to hit 400 million by 2050. Only technology has saved us from the Malthusian trap.
2747 2018-05-14 18:04:13 @potus @realDonaldTrump let's be honest the sanctions on Iran are about stimulating the local economy. There was a 30% economic spend overall not just military to your suggestion of 40%. I would however agree we should not import conflict oil from anywhere. #uspoli #cdnpoli
2748 2018-05-14 18:04:09 i’m at the car repair place getting an oil change and i’m nervous they’re about to tell my my sweet baby has 4 days to live
2749 2018-05-14 18:04:00 There was oil in it. I don’t know how it happened but I did leave the stove on for a minute and was away. When I turned around I saw that the pot was burning. I am glad it wasn’t an electrical fire
2750 2018-05-14 18:03:33 @SenSchumer white man, steal land killfor oil, mass murders, oh y’all really like kids
2751 2018-05-14 18:03:31 made the most beautiful batch of lemon oil and my bby lemon plant is growing nicely. here for it 
2752 2018-05-14 18:03:31 Sigh. So, you know nothing about Asian heavy crude oil markets or refinery demand, but you state with absolute certainty that there is no Asian market for Alberta bitumen? Then you try to cover your ignorance by challenging me to do your work for you. Good debate technique.

2762 2018-05-14 18:02:27 We actually dont have to agree on global warming, but we should agree on not polluting, things that fossil fuels do albeit have gotten better over time. Support sustainable energy so that your children can breathe better. DOnt be reflexive and in pocket of oil companies.

2764 2018-05-14 18:02:14 No, we shouldn't boycott Hawaii or impose sanctions on a volcano. But can we reasonably reduce pollution from other man-made sources? Such as oil drilling? Absolutely we can, if we increase the use of alternatives to fill the world's demand for 95 million barrels of oil a day.
2765 2018-05-14 18:02:12 I hate waiting on oil changes

2775 2018-05-14 18:01:39 What I don't understand, is how you can't see, we can do both. Big oil means energy independence for the US and it means big profits from exporting. Meanwhile, we are still working towards solar and wind power. We are also using better quality materials and not Chinese crap.

2777 2018-05-14 18:01:09 4 big factors influencing US oil markets
2778 2018-05-14 18:00:59 34 times a day! Their heads touch the floor. Not too long ago. Cults in America and elsewhere in the west were illegal. Normally consisted of a man with full access to a woman's body and he was the law. Polygamy was illegal. What happened? Oil? Did oil cost us our freedom?
2779 2018-05-14 18:00:56 Isis was Bush's fault for starting that damned illegal war that has killed THOUSANDS! All over oil, it's always over oil and money.
2780 2018-05-14 18:00:50 Hmmmm..... That's disappointing. An Oil change should be 40 minutes or less depending on the car. Easy money for the dealership. Just get the customer in and out ASAP so you can get onto the next one. Your experience shouldn't happen.
2781 2018-05-14 18:00:43 With oil prices — which sway pump prices — increasing, and summer travel demand just weeks away the price of regular unleaded could approach $3 per gallon by Memorial Day, says Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst for fuel savings app GasBuddy.
2782 2018-05-14 18:00:42 Tab crude oil price 150$ tha, abhi 70 hai.
2783 2018-05-14 18:00:38 One boiled egg.
Half one baked sweet potato. 
Three handful spinach, steamed, seasoned with olive oil.
Three Quorn chicken slices, lightly pan fried, but if you eat the meat you could just use some sliced lean chicken breast.
Sriracha for seasoning.

2795 2018-05-14 17:59:33 Ooh nice. A friend of mine had one of those (RX-8). He loved it but it guzzled fuel and oil.....I’m sure you’ll enjoy though!
2796 2018-05-14 17:59:30 Carbon pricing is only prevalent in Canada so the "broad base" is the same as our broad base in supplying the world market in oil.

The change has to start somehere though.

2802 2018-05-14 17:58:51 You sure about that? I know we don't get oil from Iran and I know that we only produce 40% of our patroleum needs, I wasn't suggesting that Iran was raising oil prices on the US. I was suggesting OPEC was in response to our actions on Iran.

2816 2018-05-14 17:57:28 Yeah and even before the sanctions tightened, the expropriation risks have always been really high. What’s to stop NK from  “renegotiating” its cut of the oil revenues whenever it wants after the pipeline has been built?
2817 2018-05-14 17:57:15 Ask him why he is endangering New Englanders' health, fisheries, and environment by allowing incompetent BP to drill in Nova Scotia. The currents will bring all our oil spill and Corexit to Georges Bank  and the Gulf of Maine too.

2821 2018-05-14 17:57:00 That oil has a more sensual smell that draws chicks even more into you caught up by the scent.
2822 2018-05-14 17:56:59 Per bbl of oil equivalent - CEO Sound got a great reputation but valuation looks nuts to me
2823 2018-05-14 17:56:56 Bonus Bonus - Because Trump hasn't been able to lift all the russian sanctions entirely, plan B: he kills the Iran deal for no real reason onther than removing one of the larger oil suppliers from the market, whilst helping Rosneft make a ton.
2824 2018-05-14 17:56:50 And the oil price is rising. Cui bono?
2825 2018-05-14 17:56:45 hell, he says. He may be right; our city's suburbs are hell. He does not believe hell is just the abscence of god. He believes in the classic Dante version of boiling pots of oil w/ people in them. Aren't I lucky.
2826 2018-05-14 17:56:40 Snake oil is a term used for a reason, buddy! I'm exceptionally glad to be proven wrong.
2827 2018-05-14 17:56:38 I think it helps to inform individuals with some basic facts that Canada’s oil & gas industry is not the black sheep it has been purported to be.  True that most articles typically don’t cover all relevant materials - this dialogue helps balance some of that.
2828 2018-05-14 17:56:34 Lol.  I don't have to, the world's already catching on especially with the UN and they're prostituting themselves for the Arab oil dollars
2829 2018-05-14 17:56:24 The oil can can disappear up there as well!

2832 2018-05-14 17:56:12 I love your recipe, but I don't like fish so I made it with pork and butter is bad for you so I used olive oil and nobody in my family likes olives so we added extra salt and blueberries. Thank you!

2834 2018-05-14 17:55:59 FACT: To avoid a lawsuit relating to the discovery of electricity in the 19th century, nervous systems used oil.

2840 2018-05-14 17:55:18 Let's not forget the important butter with carbon dioxide and Omega 7 benefit. Coconut oil to sooth the static grind of space. Of course, olive oil is good too. But, butter is essential!
2841 2018-05-14 17:55:04 No one feels bad for you. Your vote screwed the whole country. You’re paying the price for voting in a traitorous conman snake oil salesman just like the rest of us. Thanks.
2842 2018-05-14 17:54:55 Will be interested to hear if anyone -- anyone -- talks about the need to ramp down oil and gas production in the state as a complement to the (important!) demand reduction policy pathways.

2857 2018-05-14 17:53:17 US dollar is strong, because, among other things, oil is mainly traded in dollars.

2866 2018-05-14 17:51:50 The SNP didn't move their asses to help Aberdeen when oil went down, it was the Tories from WM that actually helped Aberdeen at the time. SNP don't rarely care for anything north of the Central Belt.
2867 2018-05-14 17:51:44 LIGHT olive oil.... it has to be light or it tastes awful
2868 2018-05-14 17:51:31 Perhaps if Church of Scotland declined to use any oil or gas to heat their congregations, or protect the fabric of their buildings from cold/damp deterioration, folk would be more convinced by their position.

Their congregations would vote with their feet.

2870 2018-05-14 17:51:11 As supporters of Trump, shouldn't 9/11 conspiracy theorists by now celebrate the government for faking reasons to invade unchristian, foreign nations and ensuring the USA their rightful share of oil (which is, as is public knowledge, all of it)?
2871 2018-05-14 17:50:55 Hello @BillNye . On one of your shows you were talking about Mexico City and how it was sinking because they were take the water beneath them which cause the earth to settle. #BillMeetsScienceTwitter what about all the oil being taken from the earth leaving behind huge holes.

2873 2018-05-14 17:50:45 Continuing sentiment and data show that consumer gas-at-the-pump costs will nullify any tax cuts from the #GOPTaxScam for vast majority of USA citizens. Oil industry does better. USA consumers get screwed. Just another reflection of true Trump and @GOP way.

2878 2018-05-14 17:50:03 Well, sure, and I've written hundreds of news stories and columns over the past 5 years detailing just how oil sands industry is de-carbonizing. But that doesn't mean Lorrie gets to cherry pick data on crude oil carbon-intensity. Also, CA's LCFS is relevant here.
2879 2018-05-14 17:49:54 Yes, @swadhin_pradhan, you’re right, it makes sense. To build any ML model you need large sets of training, validation and test data. If you believe ML and AI will transform industries in the future just as crude oil did in the past, then Data is indeed the new Oil.

2885 2018-05-14 17:48:58 Yup, I think the best bet is now to focus on preventing projects or at least follow New Zealand's example of banning new future oil & gas exploration. Gotta start somewhere--emissons are getting out of control!

2890 2018-05-14 17:48:08 What's worse is that Canada has far greater environmental protections than the US (and maybe everyone else?). So we kill our heavy oil, and that leaves room to grow California's even dirtier oil, thereby worsening the poisoning of our planet.
2891 2018-05-14 17:47:53 Rocket man stuff was flaccid penis waving. What is starting to happen in the Mideast is evangelical prophecy profiteers’ and war mongers’ wet dream. There’s no real money in NK, just good will with China. Mideast is tons of cash and not just from oil.

2897 2018-05-14 17:47:00 But like he was fine when I got home he was playing and everything. Just came out of nowhere. Vet said he may have issues with his ears now he is older, and once a week to massage a few drops of olive oil in his ears to stop build up. Would you suggest that?
2898 2018-05-14 17:47:00 We don't even have oil for our own use but okay

2902 2018-05-14 17:46:49 You aren't comparing apples to apples. Carbon pricing (good!) works because of it's broad-based application. With oil, killing AB's production won't likely increase price by a substantial amount as other suppliers, US notably, will happily cover the difference.
2903 2018-05-14 17:46:44 Obama's team has done nothing but divide us oil n the US...he's reaching out further...are you really surprised?

2931 2018-05-14 17:43:08 @LBC @IainDaleWHTID this MI5 speech has a ring of propaganda abt it. Is the West after Russia’s  gas , oil and minerals? Also why is there no news of the Skripals? After all, we heard nothing else day after day? Is there a blackout D notice on Salisbury ?
2932 2018-05-14 17:42:38 Maybe they’re just sick of the disregard for their rights. I don’t expect many to have empathy for Palestinians. After all, not many had empathy when US took more of sacred Native American land for an oil pipeline in North Dakota. Greed at its finest.
2933 2018-05-14 17:42:34 Not over $1. Iran has a lot of oil, and it's not in SA or Russia for them to bring the cheaper gas to the market.

2936 2018-05-14 17:42:12 Data is the new oil. It's valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used. It has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so must data be broken down, analyzed for it to have value

2964 2018-05-14 17:37:59 I'd bet on securing Oil profits, but under the guise of religious fundamentalism, which lies under the guise of religious solidarity, all of which is... terrible.
2965 2018-05-14 17:37:48 Buy oil stocks as hedge to offset
2966 2018-05-14 17:37:42 Best advice is to leave if possible coz one day you're going to be burned with cooking oil, crazy women out there
2967 2018-05-14 17:37:35 I've always had a thing for women in uniform.....
2968 2018-05-14 17:37:32 One word: OIL
Israel is an imperialist outpost, which acts as a watchdog and helps protect the USA's geopolitical interests in the region.
2969 2018-05-14 17:37:32 The amount of "available" oil always takes into account the costs of retrieving and transporting it, which is why oil companies have drilling leases they're not using.  They know the oil is there but it may not be worth getting.
2970 2018-05-14 17:37:28  Just watched #RedApe What on @BBCEarth are we doing ?. Palm Oil no more #heartbroken please  stop buying
2971 2018-05-14 17:37:24 I hate getting my oil changed 
2972 2018-05-14 17:37:16 I absolutely need a haircut soon, but I'm waiting for an oil change right now so I took my first selfies in ever and I surprisingly don't feel awful about my appearance?
2973 2018-05-14 17:37:15 Hair got so much oil in it it’s dripping down my face 
2974 2018-05-14 17:37:08 it was obvious from nov. 9, 2016 on that a huge oil deal or deals were it. dont forget koch bros., tillotson, perry, zinke, pruitt all oil ppl too. Putin is running the show.
2975 2018-05-14 17:37:06 Not everyone wants to join the military, especially now when the US foreign policy is right out in the open. We invade other countries for oil, and the corporate media cheers it on like it's a good thing.
2976 2018-05-14 17:37:02 Waiting for an oil change and the waiting room is playing just non-stop 90s country bangers, we're doing "This Kiss" right after Shania and Trisha Yearwood, bless
2977 2018-05-14 17:37:01 Oil money ba?
2978 2018-05-14 17:36:58 Trump has saved us Trillions. Get out of your bubble. He’s slashed UN budget, compelled other NATO nations to contribute their share, exited TPP, threatened tariffs, renegotiate NAFTA, exited Paris Accords, accelerated domestic oil production. These are ALL America first. Wake up
2979 2018-05-14 17:36:57 Did you try CBD oil?
2980 2018-05-14 17:36:52 52 killed and 2,400 injured today-so far, Welcome to your new Embassy, Trump

Saudi are too busy being jealous, bitter and resentful that Iran has one of the biggest oil reserves after them and Iran has huge exporting to customers from China and India
2981 2018-05-14 17:36:52 Try frying in coconut oil instead of butter. Higher smoke temp, complementary hint of flavour. Put melted butter into the batter instead.
2982 2018-05-14 17:36:46 How do you feel about this whole, "Higher oil prices will be offset by capital spending" meme that has been making the rounds? I mean, even if we are a net oil exporter, the consumer is still 70% of the economy, yes?
2983 2018-05-14 17:36:30 @HavmorIceCreams Tried Havmor cone today. Havmor is my fav brand but it was disappointing to see that cone ice-cream is made up with vegetable oil. It's not real milk ice-cream. Didn't expect this from Havmor.
2984 2018-05-14 17:36:29 Adulthood is realising what I want most in life right now is a really, really good bottle of olive oil
2985 2018-05-14 17:36:26 Try coconut and Shea butter, its probably dry and I'd like to assume organics hair shampoo and conditioner won't harm her, but you can always look for a child friendly shampoo and conditioner, but coconut oil will make it soft and moisturise it.
2986 2018-05-14 17:36:26 As a collateral story, this explains why Trump withdrew from the Iran agreement lying incessantly & publicly about his reasoning.His intent is to marginalize Iran and it’s dependence on oil, failing to realize he is causing another Middle East war far worse than the previous ones
2987 2018-05-14 17:36:25 The 'Teapot Dome Scandal' where Albert Fall, Secretary of the Interior, was bribed by Harry F. Sinclair for control of the Teapot Dome federal oil reserves in Wyoming. He was the first U.S. cabinet member to ever be convicted; he served two years in prison. (1922)

2991 2018-05-14 17:35:15 Not to change the subject, but it’s frustrating when u talk about “finite resources” but still support the Republican Party. They are chained to big oil, and will go down with it. Now we will be behind in all that technology. I don’t understand how u don’t see that.
2992 2018-05-14 17:35:14 In other words, the oil off Scotland's waters, Scottish agricultural and fishing produce, and our distillery output.
2993 2018-05-14 17:35:06 Actually, state of Wash. joined 2 other states in the climate-change lawsuit against 5 oil companies. So Sen. Ericksen's proposal for the state's 5 refineries to not provide oil to King County would more logically be extended to entire  state -- if such a move is even possible.
2994 2018-05-14 17:35:06 Plus, he’s not that special-Republicans in hock to the oil industry who will grandstand while taking legally and scientifically unsupported positions is literally all of them. Why not replace him with someone who’ll do slightly less blatant grifting?
2995 2018-05-14 17:34:59 We can keep our soldiers safe by not having them fight in foreign countries for the elites oil money. America was great when we didn’t get involved in every conflict under the sun. #maga Have y’all figured out where the 6 TRILLION dollars the pentagon lost went to yet?
2996 2018-05-14 17:34:45 oil prices have definitely played a role when things got ugly, at least historically
2997 2018-05-14 17:34:40 Is it water boarding if I use motor oil?
2998 2018-05-14 17:34:25 So I was changing oil on a lady’s car..and I noticed she had a California license plate..and around the plate said Bakersfield. (cries inside) I miss home lol
2999 2018-05-14 17:34:23 It’s a horrible, merciless disease. My deepest sympathies and condolences.
3000 2018-05-14 17:34:18 Well one things for sure.. you don't have to worry about making it mad.. and it spitting in your coffee..Though it may squirt some servo oil in it..
3001 2018-05-14 17:34:16 Dropped my car off for a little ol oil change this morning and have now spent over $200 
3002 2018-05-14 17:34:06 Ever wanted to make more savory edible meals? You can with our medicated ghee & olive oil from CYOC! (works great with baking too!)
3003 2018-05-14 17:34:06 Also, the girl doing my oil change at Valvoline just asked me if I smoke and if she could take a smoke break, so I’m doing great. #class #blessedlife #whatishappening #justchangemyoilplease

3021 2018-05-14 17:32:02 my son has extremey bad allergies, he won’t stop fighting with me and rubbing his boogers on me, i spilled oil all over the floor this morning, and i still haven’t brushed my hair. how’s your day going??

3024 2018-05-14 17:31:41 what happened to forte oil?
3025 2018-05-14 17:31:27 "Nobody" talks about it because...

A) The left thinks muslims can do no wrong.

B) The right doesn't want to lose the oil.

C) Those in the middle don't matter to anyone.
3026 2018-05-14 17:31:26 got my brow appt made just gotta change my oil and we should b good for acen
3027 2018-05-14 17:30:59 i cant drink orange powerade because it reminds me of when i lived off of free food from the BP oil spill
3028 2018-05-14 17:30:55 Exxon and oil. Sounds like a good analogy...is a bit on the edge these days...how about sunlight and solar. ;)
3029 2018-05-14 17:30:52 Argan oil cream ممتااااااز! استخدمته بعد ماصبغت شعري وشعري رطب مره.. لما ارجع البيت حصوره لك
3030 2018-05-14 17:30:39 I’m so over paying $125 for oil changes 
3031 2018-05-14 17:30:38 Or 280g of oil or butter. (but then, yoh would have not enough protein, and not enough vitamins and minerals)
3032 2018-05-14 17:30:38 Most of your investment should be deductible in the first year. You could save thousands of dollars in taxes by investing in Oil & Gas Working Interests. We always suggest consulting with a tax advisor regarding the tax benefits for your specific situation. #oilinvestment

3037 2018-05-14 17:30:04 You left out supporting ISIS for regime change in Syria and profiting from passage and sale of ISIS oil.
3038 2018-05-14 17:29:52 Thingspeak says your oil is low
3039 2018-05-14 17:29:48 didn't high oil price in 2008 nothing to do with recession just after it?

3047 2018-05-14 17:29:28 Glad to see antisemitism alive and well in Europe . Europeans and Obama have been following the nazi play book since ww 2 . Iran stole UK oil to give to Germans in ww2 , Hilter befriended Palestinians . Europeans full of nazi fascist .

3056 2018-05-14 17:28:28 Production is, over the medium- & long-term, invariably tied to demand. Canada has the 3rd highest per capita demand for oil of all OECD nations, and the world continues to demand more oil. 

Targeting production is a losers game; we need to focus our efforts on reducing demand.
3057 2018-05-14 17:28:25 Coconut oil smoothes the face. I tried it today. #coconutoil #beautybloggers
3058 2018-05-14 17:28:15 You can also add highest gas prices in 5 years caused by increase costs of crude oil and increasing instability with the Iran Nuclear Deal.
3059 2018-05-14 17:28:12 There is no such thing as a gender wage gap. Men and women get paid the same, it is found that women prefer to work non-riskier jobs like construction work, Sewers, Oil Factories and such that these are jobs that requires physical strength.
3060 2018-05-14 17:28:03 Its also known as Canola oil outside of Europe i think.
3061 2018-05-14 17:27:57 I mainly smoke oil over flower because I feel like medicinally it works better and faster. Some people I think just don’t handle drugs very well..  I wouldn’t consider that incident a normal one you see with dabs/oil

3074 2018-05-14 17:26:02 41 peaceful Palestinian protesters were shot dead today in Gaza. An ever rising body count on it's way to genocide, for the benefit of an Apartheid State in Israel. The number of dead in the Middle East is uncountably many, on behalf of foreign oil interests, 1/

3088 2018-05-14 17:24:43 Shale oil drilling now accounts for about 5.5 million barrels per day of US crude production, up from just 500,000 barrels a day in the summer of 2008. Two-thirds of America's total oil demand is now satisfied by domestic production. Wells are profitable at $50/bbl- Barron's
3089 2018-05-14 17:24:38 For a small country with high standards & whose main industries Oil & Fish operate operate outside EU (EFTA/EEA states dont have to sign up to CFP) the situation is not a bad compromise.

3097 2018-05-14 17:23:47 If the sanctions are only aimed at individuals and not the economy (especially oil sector) then the only other cause for such economic circumstances are the obviously catastrophic policies of the govt 
"Material support to fascist opposition" I assume you have evidence for that ?
3098 2018-05-14 17:23:45 The root of all evil is when you're getting an oil change and they try to sell you useless things and convince you that you're vehicle is dying. #evil
3099 2018-05-14 17:23:34 why does rosehip oil smell like hojicha,,,, like i love it but i get so confused every time i put it on my face
3100 2018-05-14 17:23:27 Yep... based on a religious text. 


As usual, the United States gets involved in matters that they shouldn’t. They shoved Isreal into the country of Palestine and then armed them to the teeth so that we would have an ally in the Middle East... yanno... cuz oil.
3101 2018-05-14 17:23:18 Take your phone, hold phone tightly, get olive oil (can be coconut or vegetable), lubricate eye socket ( be generous with lubricant), insert phone into eye socket.

3104 2018-05-14 17:23:08 I’m old school mate these new jokes go right over my head. I remember the days when gay meant you were happy, slick was oil in water, smashed was potato, rip it up or tear it up was meant for the bin. #whoosh rightovermyhead

3107 2018-05-14 17:22:33 Are you F'n kidding me?  How about you study what causes oil prices to rise before tweeting nonsense.  WOW.  #Stupid
3108 2018-05-14 17:22:32 All the reasons crude oil might go back to $100 a barrel.
3109 2018-05-14 17:22:29 Russian economy is dependent on oil sales. Oil prices double with Trump in Oval Office and with Iran out of oil market, climb even higher.

Hmmm, do you think Putin might be behind this?

3111 2018-05-14 17:21:56 Oil going up to $90 a barrel by the end of the year  Buy it in bulk now!!!
3112 2018-05-14 17:21:42 @GideonOPowell completely disagree that Texas will be the mining capital of the states. Hot summers, humid weather. Look around at current mining rates for large scale power in Texas it’s not cheap unless you own an oil/gas field, it can’t compete with Washington. #consensus2018

3119 2018-05-14 17:20:32 No, he and Ollie North would probably sell guns to both sides while deploying our military to protect our oil interests in the region.
3120 2018-05-14 17:20:29 The U.S. has routinely been floating the idea publicly of sanctions on the oil industry (and there's a good chance they're coming in the upcoming round of sanction), and the very threat of that alone plays a role.
3121 2018-05-14 17:20:24 Hey #America most of our oil comes from the #MiddleEast therefore it's safe to assume that when we unnecessarily sanction countries like #Iran over bullshit the logical retaliation is to raise oil prices. It's not rocket science people.

It's not our problem. But the 1% needs the oil.
3124 2018-05-14 17:19:22 Of course they do and that is what’s so laughable about these people

3128 2018-05-14 17:19:01 possibly you are correct. If there has been increased investment by oil companies & PRES comes out with forecast beating statement then some good gains could be made. This was a profitable company & it will be again. Lots of ifs & buts that's why I have only a small holding

3133 2018-05-14 17:18:39 Yea! I'm pissed, I can't even slough it off as Cohen being a typical snake oil, ambulance chasing lawyer, he makes John Wilkes Booth look like a patriot.
3134 2018-05-14 17:18:33 Yes. Oil prices are not under govt's control. Only way is to check misuse of vehicles. We should shut off car engine at red lights. This way we can check pollution also

3194 2018-05-14 17:12:24 Massive GOP tax cuts for oil companies will do that.

3225 2018-05-14 17:08:12 1) Russia will not intervene on behalf of Iran because they are going to benefit BIGLY by PDJT sanctioning Iran's ability to sell oil.

Oil is currently selling at $70.94. 60% of Russia's exports are from oil & gas while more than 30% of real GDP comes from the sale of oil & gas.

3256 2018-05-14 17:04:07 How much of Rosneft did Trump get thanks to #TrumpRussiaConspiracy?  Destabilized Israel and Iran means oil prices go up.  Trump can’t contain his whole graft to scamming the secret service out of hotel bills when he golfs every weekend.

Also WTF is Ivanka opening the embassy?
3257 2018-05-14 17:03:46 Sorry I'm just a dumb nationalist who can't do anything. So Scottish oil revenues from Scottish waters goes directly to Scotland. So why do I see so much poverty in an oil producing country. Why is Aberdeens infrastructure so bad in the oil capital of Europe. Explain that one
3258 2018-05-14 17:03:45 Most likely. Not a real supply & demand market condition. OPEC, & other countries that follow, raise price of crude oil because they can.
3259 2018-05-14 17:03:45 Oil market should be a free market many countries don't control prices of petroleum products bcoz its not stable. When the price of Crudeoil goes up automatically prices of those products does too. If we are still buying as same N145 so long someone is paying the difference

3283 2018-05-14 17:01:39 Assad trained & sent al-Qaeda terrorists to Iraq, facilitated ISIS take over of vast areas in Syria, ISIS supplied Assad with oil & always had safe passage through regime lines. Some fools still think these terrorists are 'Western backed'. Only US backed in Syria are the Kurds.
3284 2018-05-14 17:01:33 OBSERVATION: Although Iran’s crude oil exports boosted to recent highs in April, the storage tanks on Kharg Island export terminal actually ADDED more oil! We didn’t see enough floating storage. Therefore, Iran either boosted production (very unlikely) or cut refinery runs. #OOTT

3363 2018-05-14 16:54:11 Unionists and maths, like oil and water
3364 2018-05-14 16:54:07 Started with Dossier

My pain is water and oil that can’t mix
3366 2018-05-14 16:53:50 All the trouble in the Middle East really and truly stems back to Israel. It doesn’t belong there and I don’t believe for a minute it was put there for religious or historical reasons. It was put there for the same reason the West always interfere with the Middle East - oil.
3367 2018-05-14 16:53:28 This is what happens when you get conned by a narcissistic snake oil salesman. Don’t look for sympathy.
3368 2018-05-14 16:53:28 So I repeat why isn't all oil revenues going to Scotland.
3369 2018-05-14 16:53:21 So I put baby oil on to sit out in the garden all day. I’m not even burnt

mmmmmm can't wait to see what a month of oiling treatments will do! :D
3378 2018-05-14 16:51:47 History is repeating itself, back in the 1920 's the administration  of Warren G Harding, got busted handing off Federal Oil Leases after being bribed. This appears to be heading the same way, but this time it goes all the way to the top. Re: Tea Pot Dome
3379 2018-05-14 16:51:30 I’m sure @algore has a home somewhat close to there. Funny he’s only concerned with Canadian oil.
3380 2018-05-14 16:51:27 Whisky revenues are a tiny part of UK revenue, although larger % in Scotland. Oil / Gas revenue very small but growing a little this year. It would be fiscal suicide to base an economy on O&G (and/or Whisky revenue) as the idiot Salmond did

3396 2018-05-14 16:49:19 HUGE day for Israel as their army kill dozens of Palestinians and injure thousands. Your embassy move decision has poured oil on the flames of the Middle East. Blood on your hands and the hands of that crook and thug, Nethanyahu. The world will remember this day of slaughter!
3397 2018-05-14 16:49:09 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww

3399 2018-05-14 16:48:57 Preparation
Mix 1 teaspoon of mustard , with 2-3 teaspoons of hot water.Then add 3 teaspoons of olive oil and the egg.Finally mix it all together and make the paste.

3402 2018-05-14 16:48:34 Moderate Americans hate the fact that: 

* tensions in the middle east increase with this move
* protesters are dying as martyrs and thousands are injured
* oil prices are increasing setting the stage for economic catastrophe
* it undermines America's standing with allies

3404 2018-05-14 16:48:28 That price hike in oil is for the benefit of the Russians! Trump will not stop helping them as he owes them barrels of money! Wake up, America, we have a corrupting con as our President. GOP will do nothing about it bc they are benefiting their own pockets! Let's get rid of them!
3405 2018-05-14 16:48:17 Not quite sure yet. Will have a couple with the steak. Might just slice them up and put in olive oil with lots of fried garlic. Chargrilled red pepper style. Or might make a pasta sauce out of them for later in the week.

3409 2018-05-14 16:48:08 This is not true Ryan . With oil at its peak , Ottawa only got around .75 cents from every barrel.  
Also the oil sand were around 97% forigened owned .
3410 2018-05-14 16:48:02 Unpopular Opinion:

Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion is a necessary evil until gov’t implements drastic changes to switch from oil to renewable energies, and oil companies realize there is endless financial gain from renewables...
3411 2018-05-14 16:48:00 You absolutely are backing the Republican party. Because that's what the DNC is now.

3414 2018-05-14 16:47:40 The biggest winner for the #Trump's Iran policy is definitely Putin's Russia. With World oil prices at a very high level as a result of #Spanky's decision to pull out of the #IranNuclearDeal, the Russians have made all the money they lost from the sanctions.
#Trump paying #Putin.

3419 2018-05-14 16:47:05 I would be glad to give Trump his Russian oil profits if he would pack up and go away quietly. He could have a nice Dacha and live happily ever after. His wife could visit home more often.
3420 2018-05-14 16:46:57 Yeah, it has nothing to do with the regime printing money and over reliance on oil (i wonder why they can't diversify their economy with their anti business policies)
3421 2018-05-14 16:46:47 He knows better. He’s bought and paid for by Russia & China- age old allies in the undermining of US influence and strength. Every policy pushed by drump undermines the US and strengthens China & Russia. Every policy either allows China to replace us (tpp) or increases oil price.

3436 2018-05-14 16:44:48 The sunken ferry has nothing to do with pipeline . It's an accident with a vessel fuel spill, as any boat that might sink . Not an oil tanker nor to do with right of way for oil pipelines.

3452 2018-05-14 16:43:43 What tax “break?” Most of us have seen little to nothing—and won’t. (In fact, we’ll be paying more.) Those who really benefitted also benefit from increased oil prices. ALL of this was done to benefit the few & with wanton disregard for the vast majority of Americans.
3453 2018-05-14 16:43:21 I really prefer a potato salad with olive oil and bacon, I don't know what you guys are even talking about with your mayo.

3457 2018-05-14 16:42:48 Well, for one thing, Exxon had a deep partnership with Russia's Rosneft. His background in big oil made him a natural disaster waiting to happen with regards to climate change (although to his credit, he didn't want Trump to back out of the Paris Accord), but probably the most
3458 2018-05-14 16:42:43 I know these facts: When 1.5 or so million farmers & children in Sudan were being genocided in recent years & Muslims unarmed funded by Osama Bin Laden originally 2 take over oil rich territory, Iran Syria or Gazans couldn't care less because they were Black maybe #Israel #Gaza

3471 2018-05-14 16:41:16 Trump and Nyetanyahu are starting another war. The Iranian "nuclear power" is the narrative while we all know Iran is the 5th largest petroleum exporter in the world. Unfortunately, China is the biggest buyer of Iran oil and they are not ready to lose a supplier.
3472 2018-05-14 16:41:16 BABY OIL.

3481 2018-05-14 16:40:55 No we don’t.  That was just something you and Israel made up for whatever evil you intend to do there.  Take their oil perhaps?  You always wanted to.  How many of our troops will that cost?  Not any of your kids! Nope not yours!
3482 2018-05-14 16:40:51 I know violence is not the answer, but can we at least kill anyone who owns an oil company and also invests in water commoditization?
3483 2018-05-14 16:40:50 GST implementation messed up and hare brained Demonetization were both self-goals. The fiscal cleanup was on the account of a windfall gain due to decline in oil prices which were not passed on. NaMo and his fans complained to high heavens when oil prices were high but silent now

3497 2018-05-14 16:39:58 As I fashioned an #improvised vase for my mom’s #rose yesterday, it occurred to me that I’d been using this same trusty #leatherman #Fuze for 14 years. It’s earned an oil bath.
3498 2018-05-14 16:39:56 Sunday Night Futures: Weekend: • Schedule for Week of May 13, 2018 Monday: • No major economic releases scheduled. From CNBC: Pre-Market Data and Bloomberg futures: S&P 500 are up 7, and DOW futures are up 71 (fair value). Oil prices were up over the last week with WTI…
3499 2018-05-14 16:39:49 It's all about Oil.  Israel doesn't have oil.
3500 2018-05-14 16:39:42 If u LIVE next door to a fruit orchard, fruit is pretty cheap...if that fruit has to be refrigerated then put on a truck....it gets more expensive. #SignalHill still pulls oil out & its refined right next door
3501 2018-05-14 16:39:41 It's really not difficult to discern Trump's allegiances. He's not subtle or smart. The oil price is up 50% since Trump took office.  That translates to a 350 million dollar tax on US consumers per day. It also translates to a 1 billion increase in Russia's GDP per day.
3502 2018-05-14 16:39:41 The we accept Yuan for oil didnt stop them?
3503 2018-05-14 16:39:33 (I just reread and you're already using an oil )
3504 2018-05-14 16:39:17 Of course oil.... Has to be oil.

3512 2018-05-14 16:38:14 People it's simple, oil and water don't mix! Never will exist so let's all call it a day, The US should not be in the middle, the Palestinians don't trust the US any more. UN will be the arbiter. Stop any aid US give to either party and be neutral! Do not light a fire!
3513 2018-05-14 16:38:13 AND an Oil Change!
3514 2018-05-14 16:38:07 Please don't drive your car, take the bus or diesel train if they are powered by North Sea Oil derived fuel then as fracking has been in operation there for a long time. Don't forget plastics etc. made in Scotland may also be from fracked sources. Boycott them all to be safe.

3518 2018-05-14 16:37:57 Obvs not a Mum but you could try an oil like rosehip oil or hemp seed oil - you could get them from Holland And Barrett I expect xx

3521 2018-05-14 16:37:29 When you are the 5th GHG emitter, the largest oil exporter & the largest country in the world (with tremendous renewable resources), "better than nothing" doesn't cut it IMO.
3522 2018-05-14 16:37:28 Good luck @Sarajcox 10pm a magical slot. Massive memories of Nicky Campbell and @WhisperingBob from 10 till 0100 when burning the midnight oil as a student. Lucky kids these days have u now!!
3523 2018-05-14 16:37:24 Anyone Interested in Buying or Selling CBD Oil from an Awesome Company??
It's FREE to get started. Insane Commissions...PM for more information
3524 2018-05-14 16:37:12 Also, gambling is WAAAAAY more injurious than taking CBD oil to alleviate the symptoms of glaucoma, Parkinson's, epilepsy, arthritis, chemo, etc. "Here's next month's rent on black! Come ooonn black.. DAMN, 00. Sorry guys, can't afford food for a while".

OIL NOT INCLUDED
3528 2018-05-14 16:36:43 "No president can do much of anything to affect the short-term price of oil, and therefore gasoline. The overriding factor that determines the price of oil from day to day is supply and demand. Simple economics: When demand is greater than supply, prices rise."

3531 2018-05-14 16:36:31 Don't be tempted to wipe the rail with your finger or use a cleaning product. These can leave a layer of oil on the surfaces.
Flux cored solder is best it delivers the right amount of flux to the joint.

3532 2018-05-14 16:35:56 Feb - Mueller indicts 13 Russians. Congress mandates Trump must enforce Russian sanctions. Tillerson affirms they will be enforced
March - Tillerson fired
April - Sanctions take effect, Ruble drops 10%
May - Trump pulls out of Iran deal, oil price spikes, stabilizing the ruble

I'm really not interested in killing the planet for the sake of big oil, or making life miserable for the poor for the sake of taxpayers.
3535 2018-05-14 16:35:42 Just saw a Medium post titled "How To Become the King of UX Portfolios". 

If you're just starting in UX, please focus on the work you're doing rather than becoming the king of anything.

Also, do ignore the snake oil salesmen / writers who keep polluting our discipline.

3540 2018-05-14 16:35:00 I’m sure those really compassionate, philanthropic oil & gas companies would NEVER try to confuse the public about climate science. I mean, what do THEY have to lose? Just innocent victims of those dastardly, greedy scientists who r ALL living lives of luxury & oppulance, right?
3541 2018-05-14 16:34:59 Yeah, unbelievable hoy people wish to keep getting shoot for the location of an embassy, plus putting fire their own food and oil.

3545 2018-05-14 16:34:52 Why is it so important to you?  Yes, there is unrest, but why does America have to pour oil on the fire constantly?  Pun intended.
3546 2018-05-14 16:34:49 Rosneft is a multi-billion dollar company controlling trillions of dollars of assets (gas & oil fields). Even a small commission is worth millions of dollars. That's a hefty bribe. Also note, Russian deal was run through a Cyprus bank controlled by Wilbur Ross, now Commerce Sec.
3547 2018-05-14 16:34:37 their economies have nothing to offer except oil,I hope they will survive post oil era.
3548 2018-05-14 16:34:17 I used to argue with Helena that Dave Ramsey was a snake oil salesman.
3549 2018-05-14 16:34:04 Agreed. I retired from the oil industry. OPEC sets the market prices months in advance.

3567 2018-05-14 16:32:53 California is pushing that by 2030 all new homes will require solar panels. Combined with our state's adoption of electric vehicles, this is how we get off the oil teat.

3572 2018-05-14 16:32:37 This has been building since the late 90s,but latest phase began with Trump. Behind the scenes negotiating between Saudis, Israel and US. Huge weapons sales to SA and assurance that regime will be supported. Israel gets Jerusalem, oil in Golan heights, pipelines to the Med.
3573 2018-05-14 16:32:30 I've been to Israel many times. I've also been in the Golan Heights and to Palestinian govt headquarters in order to negotiate a deal with an Israeli oil company.

They were more peaceful, less extreme, hopeful times.

3577 2018-05-14 16:31:58 Hi Shelli, if your prone to having oily skin or if you use moisturizer that is oil based along with WunderBrow, it will not last and smudge. If this applies to you we recommend you switch to water based moisturizer and also use a toner on your brow area.

3579 2018-05-14 16:31:24 Fishing does not employ that many and a lot of boats, crews are not based in Alaska. Oil has taken hits with low oil prices. Never here much about mining. Tourism, I think, is the big driver. And people running away from whatever....lol

3591 2018-05-14 16:30:51 Oil, carbon emissions and oil spills are, regardless of what you believe about climate change, a serious problem. Moreover, oil is ultimately a finite resource. I don’t like higher fuel costs or dependence on foreign oil but I think it’s safe to say we need better alternatives.

3605 2018-05-14 16:29:06 Okay, so if thats the logic we're using - why is it you can't use say monopoly money to purchase things if YOU FEEL like the money is worth more than dirt? Your feelings dont matter bc of an objective truth. Yes to a degree our money now is based in trust, but backed by oil.
3606 2018-05-14 16:29:06 I'd rather ride to America on a trolley than pay shipping don't wanna go by car coz oil

3608 2018-05-14 16:28:38 Barely a premier league team before the oil billions.. whoppy do what an achievement! You bought your history
3609 2018-05-14 16:28:37 They cling to big oil because it’s big business. We need to start the carbon tax discussion at a national level. Won’t happen with current EPA admin.
3610 2018-05-14 16:28:26 Never been to a drive thru oil change and am an awful driver so my anxiety is killing me as I am scared I will drive into the the hole on the ground and fuck my car over in an embarrassing mess

3613 2018-05-14 16:28:22 That's great but also these people of cloth are  doing daylight robbery imagine paying large amounts only to get anointing oil is it the new religion please if that's what the Bible says I will say amen #give us a signal mama # on these prophets # Julius malema challenge

3616 2018-05-14 16:27:50 I think oil, fishing, and mining are their big ones? I guess they have troubles coming too.
3617 2018-05-14 16:27:35 Issues I found in the game (probably broken as I don't know, if it's ment to be)
- using pickaxe at trees should drop more bark then wood
- seeds in press don't produce oil anymore
- yellow lotus seeds have no use, as they don't grow
3618 2018-05-14 16:27:26 Coconut oil got me smelling like a freshly baked cookie
3619 2018-05-14 16:27:26 Yup...it's all about $$$ and oil.
3620 2018-05-14 16:27:25 But as far as Trump is concerned it's okay because he's profiting bigly from the spike in oil prices
3621 2018-05-14 16:27:24 We knew that  have you tried coconut oil?
3622 2018-05-14 16:27:24 There is also the problem of too little water and too much oil...but...

It's not who votes, it's who counts the votes~Stalin
3627 2018-05-14 16:26:34 Yes but Trump will continue profiting as oil prices continue to rise what this man just did is absolutely beyond disgusting it is atrocious and dangerous!

3631 2018-05-14 16:26:19 The whole reason Hemp/Marijuana was made illegal was because of vested interests, nothing to do with the drug at all. The cotton industry saw it as a threat, if you can grow a easier crop which produces cheap fibre, oil feed and paper, their huge investments would be screwed.
3632 2018-05-14 16:26:06 My mom won’t make my dentist or doc appointments for me but will set up an appt for my oil to be changed and then actually go with??????
3633 2018-05-14 16:26:00 Found a Walmart gift card in my wallet as I was waiting on my oil change. Had exactly enough on it for a Monster and some beef jerky 
3634 2018-05-14 16:25:56 A few years back, people told me that the main reason Venezuela is not a socialist utopia is because the oil price had crashed. Now that the oil price has doubled over the last couple years, is Venezuela going to be a socialist utopia again? Or are they still eating pets?

3640 2018-05-14 16:25:31 Never seen someone completely destroy an oil rich country because of ultimate greed and pride.   You are a horrible leader and should go back to driving buses  ppl R dying of malnutrition!  Just step down for the sake of humanity! #Maduro #Venezuela
3641 2018-05-14 16:25:30 She is a good history teacher & she understands that throughout History you do not seek peace by putting oil on the fire. You try to reconcile people by understanding them all not arming them against each other! How much kids & babies dead today in #Gaza?? #JerusalemEmbassy

3650 2018-05-14 16:24:56 lol me neither, when I go to lunch today I have to get a new tire and oil change, then go home get my clothes and come back to work until 5.
3651 2018-05-14 16:24:47 Oil is finite, sources are concentrated, marginal cost of extraction is increasing.  Data is infinite and broadly distributed. 

Maybe data is more like sand - annoyingly ubiquitous but useless until you figure out how to turn it into something (silicon wafers)

3661 2018-05-14 16:24:01 Of course you're right but it's the wrong question. Iran needs investment but Western or Chinese investors don't need Iran. They need massive focus on renewable energy & EVs. I believe the oil industry will be in a state of collapse by late 2020s. But I'm not mainstream.

3666 2018-05-14 16:23:40 I only have to give a UA every 3 months so I just stop using cannabis a month before. That guarantees I don’t lose my prescriptions. Are you looking into CBD oil? If so, I highly recommend it for chronic pain.
3667 2018-05-14 16:23:40 think i should listen to those fastmoney guys on CNBC not to buy $GE here? when was the last time these guys recommended buying any at the 52weeks low? take $oil as an example, did anyone of these guys say to buy $energy back in 2016?  they ONLY chase the winners at/near the high
3668 2018-05-14 16:23:36 No you cant face reality,,to WM you are just another daft jock with no balls who lets then take our wealth.
When the oil is gone westminster will say "At least we got the oil before they went indy",,,,to be in a union where 92% of your wealth goes somewhere else is NOT rational
3669 2018-05-14 16:23:35 And you don't think it's nuts to continue using oil when it means mass extinction? If Canada burns all the carbon in the Tarsands, it will use up 30% of the remaining GLOBAL carbon budget. That is completely irresponsible for any one country.  The very definition of "Nuts".

3673 2018-05-14 16:23:21 Like oil and water, politics and religion seldom mix. Throughout history Fundemental Religions have caused more war and hatred than any other conflict. What you say is a perfect example of this. Keep religion out of political ambitions, keep politics out of religious dogma.
3674 2018-05-14 16:23:14 The difference is an electric car CAN run on either coal, oil, gas, wind, hydro, geothermal or solar derived energy at 80% efficiency. An ICE can only run on oil dug out of the ground, refined, transported, distributed and THEN burnt at ~30% efficiency.

3694 2018-05-14 16:20:45 OPEC MOMR data on oil on water is pure fabrication. They revised down the older dates raised the newer ones, while oil on water storage has gone to zero. All their data is skewed to make things look bearish, so that companies keep hedging until its too late.

3749 2018-05-14 16:16:01 Probably because the US manipulated the oil market so that Venezuela wouldn't be able to sell. Now the US is considering an embargo to make it worse. This information can be found within 3 minutes of Google searching.

3767 2018-05-14 16:14:09 Im aware that westminster has near bankrupted an oil rich UK,,yet yoons seem to not be able to accept that.
Why should scots stick with fools who blew the oil money on tax breaks for rich?
Scots can do better than reducing an oil rich nation to poverty
3768 2018-05-14 16:14:07 Both styles are contrasting - like oil and water. Not a bad thing in isolation but not sure how it will fit together.
3769 2018-05-14 16:14:00 Yes. Lots of oil will eventually lift them.
3770 2018-05-14 16:13:53 Gas Prices I was paying BEFORE Obama came into office  $4.34 per gallon.  When he left office I was paying $1.56 per gallon.  Trump is on office less than two years gas is $3.09.  No president controls the oil, obviously, but funny how it goes up under GOP
3771 2018-05-14 16:13:49 چند سال پیش هم نظریه استخراج نفت های شِیلی (shale oil) در امریکا مطرح شد ولی قیمت تمام شده هر بشکه بیش از ۱۲۰ دلار بود و نفت ۵۰ دلاری (حالا یه کم بیشتر یا کمتر) خاورمیانه حالا حالاها وسوسه کننده ست

3851 2018-05-14 16:04:07 @lpk1657 @NIACouncil You need to grow up, Trump! You have no understanding that Iran was a friend of U.S. until we overthrew democratic govt. in Iran in 1953 so Britain & U.S. could lay claim to Iran's oil under the Shah. Let us hope our allies hold firm & do NOT listen to you.

3879 2018-05-14 16:00:58 tRUMP is pulling us out of the Iran Deal as a thank you to Putin for installing him in the White House. Congress wouldn’t lift sanctions so tRUMP found another WAY TO PAY PUTIN. Russia’s economy is in a depression. Rosneft Oil stocks (Putin’s Oil Co) have risen 33% since April.
3880 2018-05-14 16:00:58 Oil, as a commodity (or good), has two basic real economic inputs for valuation: cost of production, and utility (benefit of consumption). The market price remains relatively bounded by these.

For #XRP, these factors are unknown, convoluted, negligible, or nonexistent.
3881 2018-05-14 16:00:52 Businesses too (AWS is the only thing they're actually making money on). Bezos is like a late-stage capitalism oil baron in that rather than building museums he's selling toilet paper below cost.

The young prince is really pushing things forward here and trying to soften the image of Saudi.

3899 2018-05-14 15:59:48 @AmitShah Patrol rate highest, but the crude oil rate less than 2014 in international market.
 Are BJP making fool to us?
Think about it.
3900 2018-05-14 15:59:47 Higher oil prices are good for $NAO? Higher incentive to pump from the platforms = more supply work? Scratched it as a loss, so any upside suprise would be a welcomed shock.
3901 2018-05-14 15:59:43 You say it continues a trend . I'll say : I told you so. Trump is a snake oil salesman.
3902 2018-05-14 15:59:38 The model 3 is now $35k, the same range as a Honda Accord. And solar energy is now cheaper than coal and oil.  I’d consider these major wins. soon enough people will be driving a $20k car on renewable energy they generated at home.  Tell me how that isn’t going to change shit.
3903 2018-05-14 15:59:35 You can shine leather shoes with a cloth and some vegetable oil.
3904 2018-05-14 15:59:34 Honestly. Fuck SoHo. $6 for a cup of coffee. Niggas put olive oil next to the stirrers and I put that shit in my coffee thinking it was simple syrup. Threw that shit right out......

3913 2018-05-14 15:58:53 They're getting desperate – invoking Obama? LOL. Obama was hugely responsible for fracking proliferation. Gas co's feel they're doing good deeds by getting ppl off oil/coal. They're stuck in the 19th, 20th century. We can skip over gas at this point.

3927 2018-05-14 15:57:14 The difference is a Tesla CAN run on either coal, oil, gas, wind, hydro, geothermal or solar derived energy at 80% efficiency. An ICE can only run on oil dug out of the ground, refined, transported, distributed and THEN burnt at ~30% efficiency.
3928 2018-05-14 15:57:09 You mean CA is a corporate controlled state with big oil and all? Yep. Yuk.

3930 2018-05-14 15:57:02 Drilling productivity report due out shortly. Quick checklist of what EIA predicted:
-6.996 million BPD production from major shale plays
-3.183 million BPD in Permian
-New-well oil production of 626 bpd per Permian rig
3931 2018-05-14 15:57:01 Babe rosehip oil is like a coldpressed oil (like olive, coconut avocado) and it helps with hyperpigmentaion and dull skin. and since it seeps into the skin pretty quickly it's really good for oily skin

3935 2018-05-14 15:56:51 Again, you're proving ur ignorance. Are you really asking me how an economic system based on competing for "scarce" resources leads to countries competing for resources? Wow! How genius, why is the US only concerned w/ oil rich countries human rights?
3936 2018-05-14 15:56:40 So let me get this right you cannot have a gun video on YouTube but I looked up how to make honey oil on YouTube and found it. We are living in backwards world!

3938 2018-05-14 15:56:16 Thank you!!! Lol. It’s really quite simple. I bought fresh Italian bread, melted some butter w/roasted garlic infused olive oil, added fresh chopped garlic, garlic powder, basil, parsley.Spread the butter mixture on the bread &put it in the toaster oven. Added cheese at the end.

3940 2018-05-14 15:56:08 Going to be built #Mongolia-n new refinery will produce 1.5 million metric tons of oil, 560,000 tons of gasoline and 670,000 tons of diesel fuel, as well as 107,000 tons of liquefied gas per year. The refinery would boost country's GDP by 10 %

3949 2018-05-14 15:55:45 that I agree on - would be really good to hear from the manufacturer about which kind of peanut oil was used. The way the label reads at present, I would not suggest it as a suitable food for anyone with a peanut allergy.
3950 2018-05-14 15:55:33 Friendly reminder palm oil is in a lot of products that are not vegan, you cannot hold veganism accountable for it! Quinoa also is not a food that vegans eat 24/7, it is also a food, you guessed it that meat eaters eat! & finally lots of quorn is only veggie not vegan!

3958 2018-05-14 15:54:23 Dose it have the air pump next to the washer bottle in the engine bay? These engines have a plastic breather and oil separator under the inlet manifold. my guess its either the pump or the breathers need replacing... (its good to replace them anyway as the heat makes them crack)

4032 2018-05-14 15:48:08 Girl it is!! I had a dream once that I accidentally drank oil and when I spit it out all my front teeth come out  they feel so fucking real
4033 2018-05-14 15:48:01 me and co conversations be like bro what’s the difference btwn engine and transmission oil 
4034 2018-05-14 15:47:51 I also think Trump is giving something to NK to get them to say they will denuclearize, something under the table. Not sure, but It may have something to do with all the oil riches and possible oil deal. Trump and his buddy Putin gets rich from Rosneft, war with IRAN raises oil $
4035 2018-05-14 15:47:47 Perhaps organizing a rally closer to home might be an option? But I do encourage people like you to continue to speak up and protest because you are becoming the oil sectors best friends. When CDN's see how nuts most in your movement are they side with the energy sector.
4036 2018-05-14 15:47:43 So my medical terminology teacher said hot oil treatments aren’t good for your scalp not hair growth

4039 2018-05-14 15:47:29 If you've got some anti-competitive practice the oil companies engage in to list, go ahead, I'll read. I'm willing to give you that. But be aware, I know something about the production of ethanol and the storage, transmission, and reliability issues around other renewables.

4045 2018-05-14 15:46:44 If big data is the new oil... that means a huge corporation wants to drill ever deeper into your house, life, and ultimately your brain.  Am I wrong?

4051 2018-05-14 15:45:53 Your response is quite apt. People think because we have oil, everything should be free... Lazy mentality.... This is no Finland or Norway... Population matters....

4054 2018-05-14 15:45:16 DJT has stated repeatedly that we should've stolen their oil. He still wants to take their oil. That's what this is about.
4055 2018-05-14 15:44:45 Shouldn't he be using her real name then?
4056 2018-05-14 15:44:45 The #MomTips have sprung out of talking to my mom and me general experience. She was lamenting on how much little stuff my dad took care of that she never even thought about. Changing filters, oil changes, pilot lights, etc.
4057 2018-05-14 15:44:39 Thani we understand Qatar has concerns about Saudi foreign policy, you want to be the last one standing in the gulf as the west abadons the Saudi when oil runs out because their relationship is on interest, they did the same to shah. Your fathers feared this

4064 2018-05-14 15:44:00 America first is the process of bringing the ability to be successful back to the individual We have a tangled mess of interests now (support refugees, oil, international agreements, etc) These agreements are not good for most people Rip up and let people solve their own problems
4065 2018-05-14 15:43:54 Have you ever noticed that we only care about dictators in places where there’s oil? The way you keep trying to make this seem like a humanitarian mission is laughable

4067 2018-05-14 15:43:53 I hate how bad my anxiety is right now. My heart is racing just because my car is getting an oil change, and I'm afraid they're going to call me and tell me I can't drive it anymore because something horrible is wrong with it.

4072 2018-05-14 15:43:06 I wonder if she washed her hands after rubbing oil on her arms. 
4073 2018-05-14 15:42:56 The production and use of renewable fuels has grown recent years as a result of higher prices for oil and natural gas, and a number of state and federal government incentives, including the Energy Policy Acts of 2002 and 2005.

4083 2018-05-14 15:41:40 @realDonaldTrump Also very high prices on Gas, and Oil.Gas prices are at 2:91 per. Gal ,oil is very high also,we need help also...

4085 2018-05-14 15:41:24 Iran oil sanctions? Now we know the true intent of breaking the treaty. Watch as our corrupt gov. makes Russia our biggest oil import.
4086 2018-05-14 15:41:21 Thanks for the feedback Shiv! Have you tried our Almond Oil Fiery Thai? It's similar to the old Spicy Thai; perhaps that will fulfill your craving!
4087 2018-05-14 15:40:59 my plan today was to get up, shower, and go get a new tire but here i am still laying in bed telling myself i can get up extra early tomorrow and do it before my oil change
4088 2018-05-14 15:40:58 I don't even know what to call it, it's made of wood...I got it at an artist fair in Providence. I'm sure if you typed "wood bracelet essential oil" into etsy you'd see stuff like it come up.

4092 2018-05-14 15:40:45 One way to do that is to mandate the bitumen be upgraded to synthetic crude before it's exported. Oil co's don't want that. It's way cheaper to sell it to China raw. Sinopec can outbid the Americans with what they save on labour.

4098 2018-05-14 15:40:26 We can all find info to support our arguments but you're missing the point. This a war about power & wealth over oil and pipelines. Israel wants Syria. It has already annexed the Golan Heights. Israel is aided and abetted by US. #FollowTheWonga

4102 2018-05-14 15:40:09 Well, today I almost started a grease fire. Side note, I learned that vanilla and cooking oil in fact does not make popcorn taste very good it makes fires and splashes grease all over the place to the point where I had to clean it all up and nearly got burns from grease and fire.

4112 2018-05-14 15:38:42 I misspelled it (it's Cermalon). It cleans up like magic but I've taken to heart its warning never to use extra virgin olive oil in it as apparently that WILL burn on(!)

4114 2018-05-14 15:38:34 There is a lot of oil left - and a lot of coal left. But most of both will not be exploited. Have you heard of decommissioning costs? Of low taxes on oil companies (Swinney begged Osborne to do that when prices fell)? Of difficult and expensive extraction in Scottish wells?
4115 2018-05-14 15:38:20 Mind = blown

Still happy that gas isn’t $4 like it was in 2011. But on the flip side oil money is good for Texas.

4117 2018-05-14 15:38:18 I paid $3.39 per gallon for #diesel fuel today. The average cost on the day #Trump was elected was $2.45 per gallon, the result of the his energy dominance policy. Oil companies win. #Americans lose.

4132 2018-05-14 15:37:37 All they need to do is shoot at a couple of tankers and oil prices will sky rocket.  They don't need to sink it or seriously hurt it.  Just a few bullet holes in a couple of tankers will do the trick.

4134 2018-05-14 15:37:23 Agreed Texas discounts have nothing to do with White House but, couldn’t the Western Canadian Select heavy oil discount be attributable to White House delay on KXL approval though?

4140 2018-05-14 15:36:45 You'd rather we have a tax increase?  You see a relationship between oil prices and the GOP tax cut?  Nah, you're just another 'resist at all cost' whining little girl.
4141 2018-05-14 15:36:38 No-one puts you down. But your ignorance is staggering. Does the government own all the food companies? No. So who gets the profits from food sales? The companies. They pay tax on the profits, and that is what the govt gets. Govt does not get all the income from food, oil, whisky
4142 2018-05-14 15:36:22 They weren’t shit till 2010. Lyon had that league locked down but once that oil money came in it was ovo for everyone. Sounds a whole lot similar to city  #oilmoney
4143 2018-05-14 15:36:08 Translation: "fully committed to propping up the price of oil no matter what the cost to people or planet."
4144 2018-05-14 15:36:01 Oil flow from Iran wont be cut off much anyway.  Japan and Korea get exemptions, spice will keep flowing to China and India (their top 2 export markets).  Europe may see a small cut, however Iraq can pick up any decline here, or even the Saudis

4148 2018-05-14 15:35:28 And this is all *before* Trump cuts us off from Iranian oil, and, in theory, also kicks out european energy companies doing business in Iran too.
4149 2018-05-14 15:35:17 Norway created is oil fund at the beginning of oil production, so creating one now is ridiculous, based on current NS production levels. Norway also kept taxation and borrowing high in order to avoid touching its oil fund.

4152 2018-05-14 15:35:01 A country (Israel) which gave up a land rich in oil & greater in size than itself to a country (Egypt) which once threatened its existence, when the same country (Egypt) agreed to peace, defends itself from violent rioters who threaten to destroy it. "41 Palestinians" #Gaza

4154 2018-05-14 15:34:47 I liked this way of putting it. You could in a bath of pure CBD oil while eating a CBD edible and drinking a CBD smoothie, and guess what? You still won't get high!

4156 2018-05-14 15:34:44 sounds like some are hoping for another housing crisis to profit off of congress is working on deregs while trump is driving oil prices up
4157 2018-05-14 15:34:42 One question remains. When? 2020? 2030? 2040? 2050? Maybe a race condition between countries could help taking our efforts to reach that goal up a notch. However low oil and energy prices keep delaying that race. #Australia

4163 2018-05-14 15:34:31 Oh, you don't like oil and gas? No problem.
4164 2018-05-14 15:34:29 PH hv some breathing space cos of the higher Oil & LNG prices.But it maybe only a short window. 

They need to quickly find a more sustainable revenues &

4201 2018-05-14 15:29:37 No denying it. Trump has stained us all with his contempt for decency, casual mendacity, willful ignorance & disdain for diplomacy. His corrupt one-man snake oil show of chaos and death is enabling the killing of Palestinians today. Who will be next?

4207 2018-05-14 15:29:00 I have to say even though I dont feel 100% still today I've gotten a good amount done so far. Got the oil changed in my car, did dishes, took out trash. I still want to vaccine and fold laundry but I dont think I'll get that done before PT. Going to lunch with mom in a minute!
4208 2018-05-14 15:28:58 ...are necessary or justifiable. Both regime change and torture are very much on brand for the CIA, so Haspel is a good look for them, I suppose, but neither of these activities cause benefit for the general populace, here or abroad, just for weapons industry & big oil.

4219 2018-05-14 15:27:44 This is a very fair point. I'm all in favour of drawing attention to important issues via peaceful means. Important to ensure that the palm oil industry is aware that, pros and cons aside, the world is watching how they operate... and taking notice.

4303 2018-05-14 15:18:51 And why??? Because a large misinformed part of our population and politics is focused on a tiny part of our economy, oil.
5% of our GDP, tar sands is half of that.

4309 2018-05-14 15:18:24 As opposed to Imperial Oil, who operate on sheer altruistic patriotism? IMO, halting green & brownfield expansion to cry about red tape & not getting a pipe is a great move by IMO. Costs nothing, applies pressure... where's the downside?

4315 2018-05-14 15:17:51 Most foods with a cap have an approximate measurement in the cap. Salad oil? One tablespoon. Milk with plastic caps? One teaspoon. And so on.
4316 2018-05-14 15:17:46 There you are, already making assumptions about people you don't know. What have the 'English media' misled us about regarding oil and whisky revenues?  You must know, if you are making that claim.

4357 2018-05-14 15:15:00 So.....let me get this straight.  It's okay to count on and budget revenues from a pipeline that (in defiance of reason) may not ever get built, but higher oil prices is where you draw the line.

Palm oil is in most of your ugly ass cosmetic products... cool #plantlife but I bet y'all didn't know palm oil harvesting has the largest impact on deforestation? Hundreds of species are dying at the cost of your... "beauty". Eat vegan y'all it's hip.
4360 2018-05-14 15:14:38 Like you have raised electricity bills. People must pay for the cost. Oil producing countries don't supply oil for free or on subsidy. Have you understood Mr Duffer.

4362 2018-05-14 15:14:11 You and @TuckerCarlson  should do a segment on info coming out about how China is pushing to use a PetroYuan.....they have new contracts with those buying oil to use their monetary form and move away from a global use of US dollar.

4364 2018-05-14 15:14:10 That is silly

From a position of dominance it may appear such, but we are rapidly approaching a point where economic dominance fails

Like when oil starts getting traded in other currencies, and/or as that trade diminishes

There isn’t enough labor to be diverted to 1000 walls
4365 2018-05-14 15:14:04 Lame and old. You need a new whine. Oil interests were against US recognition of Israel.

4377 2018-05-14 15:11:52 Tea tree oil and coconut oil helped my dry flaky skin
4378 2018-05-14 15:11:48 And in a vegan diet maybe worth checking how much palm oil/coconut oil/veg oil etc they are eating, and encouraging consumption of nuts, green veg etc if they are not already eating these. (I'm guessing you'll already have asked about diet, but juuuust in case!)
4379 2018-05-14 15:11:48 Actually, terrorism is what Israel has been doing for decades like exterminating Palestinians and doing 9/11 which was a false flag operation carried out by the Mossad to blame the Muslims and bomb seven countries into the stone age to steal their oil resources.

4444 2018-05-14 15:06:40 The U.S. can be trusted, unless you are every other ally except Israel.  Of course we seem to have gained the trust of Russia, especially as we help drive up the price of oil.  And maybe gaining favor with China as we help to rebuild ZTE.

4448 2018-05-14 15:06:31 :)  thanks! Tar sands...just two accurate adjectives, used by laypersons and scientists alike. I guess for some any deviation from Big Oil euphemisms are pejorative. #StopKM
4449 2018-05-14 15:06:23 I'm not sure why anyone would have expected anything different. Alberta seems determined to become the Alabama of Canada. Alabama with oil (for now).
4450 2018-05-14 15:06:18 So the oil companies in India were forced by Narendar Modi government to not raise fule prices till it cons ppl in Karnataka?? Minumum Governance ? #CorruptBJP

4452 2018-05-14 15:06:14 Not too many voters, of thee largest voting base...give two shits about all of the accomplishments overseas...when fucking gas approaches $4 a gallon...and oil is near a 4 year high.

4453 2018-05-14 15:06:07 Why is McKenna meeting with Greenpeace ? Caribou, plastic straws, oil..............When does Greenpeace ever actually DO anything to help the environment ?
4454 2018-05-14 15:06:02 They are all inter-related. The Governments involved seek power and money through oil and the citizens get slaughtered live in servitude or are forced to flee. Our government for the last ...oh, 75 years have been involved.
4455 2018-05-14 15:05:50 Is there an Essential Oil® to make Mondays easier?
4456 2018-05-14 15:05:27 Asha. Could you get into the details of what laws were broken with them brokering this Oil sale? I would guess the Logan Act but beyond that no idea. I think it's important people understand the difference between unethical and illegal. Thanks!

4462 2018-05-14 15:05:04 Because the salt and slimy oil is the only sources of flavor in their crummy product. Gag!
4463 2018-05-14 15:04:54 I think at one point i tweeted about vaping cum or cooking oil or some such shit, and a vape oil store followed and retweeted me
4464 2018-05-14 15:04:51 They are not. Scotlandid doesn't receive oil or whisky revenues because whisky comes in English ports so it classified as uk
4465 2018-05-14 15:04:32 Trump has 19% in a Russian oil company pulling out of the Iran deal is gonna mean Russian and Saudi oil prices will rise, this is a win win for the orange bagOshite

4467 2018-05-14 15:04:26 .@GeorgiaLLS and @smhwsn: Most of Canada's MPAs are open to extractive activities. Oil and gas, fishing, deep sea mining etc. can all be allowed through exceptions. 

This isn't great. Law needs to establish minimum standards for MPAs

4485 2018-05-14 15:03:02 Flynn was slated for decades in prison.  The fact he may see little jail time is not because he was a witness to Trump tryin' to lift sanctions.  

This weekend's news of Rosneft Oil money puts Flynn at ground zero for the "Quid Pro Quo" of the Russian Collusion/Conspiracy.

4488 2018-05-14 15:02:56 What oil wealth and whisky revenues do you think aren't already allocated to Scotland?
4489 2018-05-14 15:02:50 "The dollar's in great shape today, it will stay in great shape."
Who in their right mind could make that statement? Countries are fleeing the USD left and right, in the areas that matter (oil, for example). I, myself, certainly don't trust the USD to be useful for retirement.
4490 2018-05-14 15:02:45 It’s May and the coconut oil in my room is liquid. Which means it’s above 76 degrees. I could be in for a long summer in my humble room. May look into a mini ac unit. My sweaty meatball half Italian ass ain’t sleeping in that haha.
4491 2018-05-14 15:02:41 Oil is about to hit $80 we need this to work for the UK or we will be hammered by the imports. Jeez get behind UK PLC . We are all going to need the revenue .

4498 2018-05-14 15:01:53 every time i go in for an oil change, i end up spending more money on my car by fixing something

4505 2018-05-14 15:01:38 Bhai, we don't produce crude oil in our factories (like we produce potatoes, as per you). Prices are determined globally. For your kind info, global prices are at 4yr highs and there is a limit to which it can be subsidised. Can't blow up fiscal.
4506 2018-05-14 15:01:38 We knew of the oil scandal well before the election took place. Glad to see it hasn't been swept under the rug.

4526 2018-05-14 14:59:58 Doesn't that statement apply to *everyone's* oil, though? So perhaps the cited number is inaccurate, but it's useful as a relative measure to other countries' oil production

4531 2018-05-14 14:59:27 For the 15th time this year, oil prices have increased. Including impact of TRAIN, price hikes per liter now total:

Diesel - Php8.95
Gasoline - Php8.07
Kerosene - Php9.15

Since Duterte became President, oil prices have already increased by Php14+ to Php16+ per liter

4545 2018-05-14 14:57:38 I love robotic oil poffins~!
4546 2018-05-14 14:57:35 Check again.  Trump's policies and selling of US oil to other countries is clearly leading to higher oil prices.  The uncertainty and sanctions with Iran will add significantly more to the price of oil.  If he starts a war or lets Venezuela collapse it will get much much worse.
4547 2018-05-14 14:57:34 Sounds more like a snake oil salesman everytime he opens his mouth.

4552 2018-05-14 14:56:46 Apparently fuel price hike has very little to do with the market situation. It is currently used as a state apparatus to manipulate cashflows for the oil companies.

4562 2018-05-14 14:55:54 Agreed. But two peoples legitimately claim the same land, and have for eons. Outside of constant warfare, there are only two solutions: an agreed peace settlement; or one side's complete victory, followed by ethnic cleansing. Trump just poured oil on the fires of warfare.
4563 2018-05-14 14:55:51 Politician are looting common people money.

In 2014, crude oil per barrel was $110 & petrol was 72.

When crude oil rate came to $26, why petrol rate hadn't reduced.

Now it is $70, petrol should be less.

4567 2018-05-14 14:55:37 So, monopolize as in they do not produce better energy value as it's not renewable, if its subsidies were removed, it would have to convert coal, natural gas, & kerogen(tar sands & oil shale) into synthetic petroleum.

 Synthetic fuel can perform better, but it's not permanent.
4568 2018-05-14 14:55:35 USCG clarifies that some expenses are covered by the spill liability trust fund, which comes from taxes on crude oil. If/when a responsible party is identified, officials will determine what if anything they'll pay.

4574 2018-05-14 14:54:50 Oil brought in £208m based of geographic share in 2016–17. That's actually less than was raised in Air passenger duty (£264m). An oil fund now would be ridiculous based on the low revenue.

4587 2018-05-14 14:53:38 The astonishing ignorance and naïvety Brian shows is summed up in tat tweet. He has't a clue about the current value of oil to the economy. Trickle up? WTF? Doesn't he think growth has been tried? - and not very effectively. Removing the threat of separatism would promote growth.

4599 2018-05-14 14:52:40 Hope it is true.  We know it involves Airline manufactures and Politicians with stock in those companies. Plus those involved with oil imports, friends of Obama like Soros
4600 2018-05-14 14:52:36 Also, oil price now based on speculation, when in the past, it was based upon supply & demand. A more accurate headline would be “Jump In Fuel Price Softened By Tax Cut In States With Higher Road Taxes.”

4604 2018-05-14 14:52:14 When this is over?  If any of us survive, what will be the gain?  Wh9 cares about having all the money and oil and assets if there is nothing to spend it on, no one to repair the cars, refine, transport, pump the oil, grow, harvest, and transport food, etc.?

4606 2018-05-14 14:52:07 ENI's senior management did not make a final decision to stop oil imports from #Iran. Their supply  contract ends in Nov, and they will wait and see how the sanctions are implemented before renewing, another option is reducing volumes #OOTT #Iran #Opec
4607 2018-05-14 14:52:05 Sold out of the June 15 $CRC $35 calls. Average cost was 1.97 and sold for 3.00. Looking to buy back into the August calls and take some risk off the table. This is a high beta play on higher oil prices. #OOTT

4609 2018-05-14 14:52:00 16 trillion total number reduced in bank spending oil consumption will reduce by say 10 percent of 100million per day 90 million would be the per day consumption
4610 2018-05-14 14:51:58 As China re-introduces physical gold as oil payment, trading action of unbacked 'paper' gold contracts becomes irrelevant.

Flynn was slated for decades in prison. The fact he may see little jail time isn't because he was a witness to Trump tryin' to lift sanctions

It can’t be a good idea to do something that clearly pours oil into the fire.
For a peace process whether to start a new one or to continue, it needs de-escalation.
But then again- de-escalation doesn’t seem very popular in the US if you look at their police e.g.

In contrast in India, if futures volume increases, regulators find it as too speculative & look to curb. Who is more inward looking - China or India? @RBI @SEBI_India @SandeepParekh
4723 2018-05-14 14:41:56 Nix Iran deal in return you get illegally held captives (photo op) & the appearance of possible peace in Korea. This is a trump/putin deal. Russia sells goods & nuclear technology to N Korea so they have influence. Russia gets  increased oil prices. It's Raining Rubles!
4724 2018-05-14 14:41:54 The phrase ‘Data is the new oil’ only makes sense if you understand almost nothing about machine learning
4725 2018-05-14 14:41:51 Sprinkle with a Little salt oil & wine vinegar
4726 2018-05-14 14:41:40 Place open order to buy July coffee at 116.5 or better. Trying to retest the lows. Stay long Soybean Oil and hedged soybeans. Should be filled & long July sugar. Weak beef complex-waiting #Agriculture #Commodities #Soybeans #sugar #Beef #Farming

4728 2018-05-14 14:41:30 OffICIALA MEMBERS OF REGIME IN IRAN AND THEIR FAMILIES SEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF OIL AND PEOPLE MONY AND THE MONEY OBAMA SEND TO THEM ,SAVE TO OVEREAS BANK , THEY BOUHT PALACES IN CANADA , ERUOP , LATIN AMERICA ,THINK TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ISSUE
4729 2018-05-14 14:41:29 When I first heard @bitstein say “Bitcoin is a revolt against fiat money, and an all-meat diet is a revolt against fiat food” I thought, funny but glib. “Red meat causes cancer, veggie oil is heart healthy, nutrients are only in veggies” All fiat, just proclaimed with no data
4730 2018-05-14 14:41:26 argan soap, celeteque toner, clobetasol (for pimple), tea tree oil and aztec lang. haha ikaw?
4731 2018-05-14 14:41:18 Fried yam is bae
Then Roasted yam and palm oil 
4732 2018-05-14 14:41:08 Oil isnt an infinite resource & drilling has been shown to have serious consequences for the environment but since oil tycoons own Washington they are doing everything possible to keep their product relevant even if it means invading other nations for their oil
4733 2018-05-14 14:41:06 beard oil
4734 2018-05-14 14:40:56 You don't have to be defensive. Let the barbarians attempt to storm the gates but beat them back with facts and information. That scares the shit out of them and runs them off like scalding oil pores from the ramparts.
4735 2018-05-14 14:40:51 楽しいよ？みんなやってるよ！！
4736 2018-05-14 14:40:49 Add some oil and you can make mayonnaise...

4738 2018-05-14 14:40:36 This is absolutely brilliant Adam! Well done! You have clearly done a lot of research. We’re really happy you’re supporting our campaign to make Chester the first sustainable palm oil city and letting other people know too! Keep up the amazing work and spreading the word!
4739 2018-05-14 14:40:30 Smug, entitled, Ivanka and Jared sitting there as revelations come out about Trump brokering oil deals with Saudis and Russians in the WH.

4745 2018-05-14 14:39:47 We are always happy to do business with the rogue royal Al Saud family. We buy their oil, sell them weapons. Double standards!
4746 2018-05-14 14:39:35 The decomposition point of Olive Oil is 220 degrees Celsius
4747 2018-05-14 14:39:28 Are the Royals a dumpster fire with an endless supply of oil to keep burning or are they a forest fire that looks bad now but will soon have a plentiful growth of new life that looks better than before?
4748 2018-05-14 14:39:26 A good album should be like a puddle: wet; Cozy, in the streets, caused by rain, Dry; a camel, oil, rich in texture, Sold By The Pound, far, near, The President, in my ass, also
4749 2018-05-14 14:39:20 Yes! Jars of things like pickles, beetroot, cooked veggies in brine/oil that can be drained and eaten as they are too. Also the little jars of sandwich pastes (my Grandad loved them) last a long time and can be eaten as they are.

4751 2018-05-14 14:39:09 I'm wondering about whether using fresh avocado in a marshmallow recipe would cause it to brown after a bit.  Maybe better to use avocado oil for the flavor (or extract, if such a thing exists), and food coloring for the green?  Thoughts?

4763 2018-05-14 14:37:05 The faster we move away from a reliance on oil the better the world will be

4765 2018-05-14 14:36:52 People are losing their lives over a business deal. trump only makes business deals that benefit him. Korean deal is a business deal. Look for trump properties to pop up over there.  The oil companies are cashing in on their new tax break with the oil prices rising. #Greed
4766 2018-05-14 14:36:52 I use the oil as is.

4794 2018-05-14 14:34:21 We could sell oil, as long as the market price enables it to make a profit. And while we could do an oil fund the revenues aren't there at the moment and, if we're putting the money into an oil fund, you're going to need to find other money to spend on everything else.
4795 2018-05-14 14:34:19 Clear your mind before you !! Because That Oil Will Make You Talk!! #ThatsRealTalk
4796 2018-05-14 14:34:18 Israel and Hamas are exchanging bombs and rockets at the Gaza strip. As the price of oil rises, it's only a matter of time before a match is lit. In the Middle East,  t U.S. has no foreign policy personnel. All we have is Kutsner. That does not give me a sense of security
4797 2018-05-14 14:34:17 I never said bankrupt....and it’s far from bullshit. Try reading the UN report. As for the deaths that’s in the DWP’s own reports. Tantamount to Tory genocide...we’d be invading an oil rich country if they did the same.....killing the county and killing its most vulnerable

4810 2018-05-14 14:33:31 Sure there has been pill form called Marinol for ages. It’s more for appetite in cancer patients. The oil does wonders for certain people with seizure disorders. I don’t want recreational use. The lobbying force that comes with it are worse than the gambling lobby.

4836 2018-05-14 14:31:23 Doesn’t it depend: 1. Oil goes up cause robust demand from growth is ok, 2. Oil goes up from lack of supply (embargo), bad?
4837 2018-05-14 14:31:13 It’s the Putin program. Make megabucks selling guns and oil. Kill anyone who disagrees with you.
4838 2018-05-14 14:31:12 Gold and silver's trading ranges are extremely narrow. Both are gathering momentum for a big move. But will it be up or down? As long as oil keeps going up, I favor long.
4839 2018-05-14 14:31:08 100% agree. biggest goal for #Putin is to utilize his #ManchurianCandidate to circumvent  #RussianSanctions oil is ALL Russia has why @realDonaldTrump pulled out of #ParisClimateAccord & why dt "digs coal" Putin told him to.

4854 2018-05-14 14:29:56 It's not just lack of oil which causes problems - we see many cars with advanced wear and gear change issues because the wrong oil is used. Always check the manufacturer's handbook and buy an approved oil!
4855 2018-05-14 14:29:49 Full service. Would you like your oil checked?
4856 2018-05-14 14:29:45 Nice piece. Perhaps Trump's next move will be to help Putin diversify the Russian economy away from its reliance on oil to Make Russia Great Again
4857 2018-05-14 14:29:41 Keep a side your ego and ask how MMS managed oil prices in control during crude were on top and without disturbing our growth rate.
4858 2018-05-14 14:29:36 Why are you not supporting to bring oil in the GST?
4859 2018-05-14 14:29:35 Agreed. A PJ trader myself, I bought today. Good day 4 market. Trade tensions , but who knows could come bac in next couple days. Keepin eye on Israel tensions in Mid-East. Military & oil stocks could get lift. + EU increasing military spending. Trump will keep avoid war

Environmental regs would be repealed, CA healthcare would disappear & oil drilling & fracking would become CAt's largest employers.

4864 2018-05-14 14:28:48 The reason I’m not worried about rising rates and oil prices is because stocks keep moving higher. I’ll worry about rising rates and oil prices when stocks stop moving higher.
4865 2018-05-14 14:28:48 Same with the oil price, less than $60 a barrel is bad news. More than $60 a barrel is also bad news

4869 2018-05-14 14:28:28 A year ago I had a dream it was Kushner who did the deal with Putin and Rex and Trumpsky for the Russian oil
4870 2018-05-14 14:28:24 I love the $4 gas prices.  That is a great accomplishment for the oil tycoons.  So, much for the tax cut, it's all going towards hire gas and not being able to write off stuff like in the past.  Oh, but if you own a private jet you can.  That helps who?
4871 2018-05-14 14:28:19 Actually, the Iran oil embargo was the starting bell, and that happened under Carter.  But we would have recovered better without Reaganomics.

4917 2018-05-14 14:23:47 The notion that Trump could personally financially benefit from a major war breaking out in the Middle East by jacking up the price of oil and that that in turn might influence his foreign policy is frightening, and frighteningly plausible.

5002 2018-05-14 14:13:39 Plus there are more jobs in green energy than in fossil fuels now and it's a growing industry as opposed to the shrinking oil one. Add in the jobs of actually cleaning up spills and sites rather than covering them up and its a virtual boom waiting to happen.

5004 2018-05-14 14:13:17 When Election Comes...Oil Price Goes Down..!!! When Election Over...Oil Price Raising High..!!! Why it is Happening ???? Since Govt. has Decontrolled Oil Price, then it Should Not be Happened...!!! Or that Price Decontrolled Decision of Govt..was a Public Stunt Only ????
5005 2018-05-14 14:13:11 ขอชุดปังๆให้พี่เจ
5006 2018-05-14 14:13:10 Yay my 14 months of running a oil change place.
5007 2018-05-14 14:13:07 When I try to remove mascara and then I get both coconut oil mascara in my eyes so my eyes cry and then suddenly I’m a fucking bigger mess..... lmao
5008 2018-05-14 14:13:05 The active disinfectant ingredient is thymol which is a component of thyme oil, and it does have a strong herbal scent to it. At this time this is the only scent we offer for our wipes. If you would like to know more, please give us a call at 1-800-456-1191.
5009 2018-05-14 14:12:57 久しぶりに引っ張り出して聞いたけど初期メンよい…

5011 2018-05-14 14:12:54 Been using that oil again you hahahahaha
5012 2018-05-14 14:12:47 Just learn to stop feeling. They need to disinfect instead they desensitized us as humans. Look beyond because they only see green, gold and now black as in CRUDE OIL. All an act.
5013 2018-05-14 14:12:18 You do not drive, heat your home, eat food, use oil based products evertday essential for your survival? Its not perfect but its the safest way to deliver . Until humanity can survive without out oil we must get it to market. We must Hold the companies to the highest standards
5014 2018-05-14 14:12:16 The story is Greed and Corruption dominates the oil and gas industry from the governor's office to the mayor's office.They do what they want, when they want,and how they want to do it.Biggest destructive thing that could've ever came around. Sure people got money but not worth it
5015 2018-05-14 14:11:45 Looking at US Pentagon Mentality, guess you have to break all the agreements with Iran before you can attack Iran...to steal the Syria Oil... So US is on the path on destruction...Your really going to try this aren't you...Hmm  need to give them a choice they can't refuse.
5016 2018-05-14 14:11:44 Great Video Dave!  20 minutes was too short.  How does MCT/coconut oil confound your data?
5017 2018-05-14 14:11:37 Board member pushes the point, asking for an assessment of how much time conditions in the Straits would make it difficult to respond to on oil spill because of brash ice, gale-force winds, blizzard conditions, etc.
5018 2018-05-14 14:11:32 I don’t think I’ll be doing an oil change today. I’m not sitting at the dealership all day.
5019 2018-05-14 14:11:28 India was buying Iranian oil by paying in Rupee (45% of total cost & 55% in Euros) and Rupee is not backed by Gold. Why Yuan has be backed by Gold?
5020 2018-05-14 14:11:18 I think second gen from 2012. Asides from an oil consumption issue that thankfully was fixed in a recall, it runs very well and I'm getting wicked good gas mileage compared to my old Jeep Libby.
5021 2018-05-14 14:11:17 Tarek tryna put his pee in my oil diffuser ?
5022 2018-05-14 14:11:17 Records show Trump got .5% of the Rosneft Oil deal.
He offered to remove Russian sanctions in return.
5023 2018-05-14 14:11:12 おでぶになりますよ！
5024 2018-05-14 14:10:54 Can we use jojoba oil ad a cleanser right?
5025 2018-05-14 14:10:47 Step 1. Invest and Russian oil
Step 2. Become president 
Step 3. Destabilize the Middle East oil and drive up prices. 
Step 4. Profit
is this a crazy liberal conspiracy…Or plausible?
5026 2018-05-14 14:10:39 She needs to stop meddling and let the voice of the people speak at the ballot. If UK wants to destroy Chamisa that wouldn't be the first time they have destroyed a change agent,They have done it in oil rich countries. If @CamAnalytica can shut down for meddling this is zilch

傷口は舐めて治すからいいんだと、勿論縫いましたが舐めてもOKと。
犬なので嚙み切る心配は殆どなかったですけどね。
ストレスが一番いけない、というのはあるんでしょうね。症例にもよりけりでしょうけど。

5029 2018-05-14 14:10:24 we got "west country butter" brownies at work and everyone told me to look at the ingredients bc they had bad ingredients in them... was SO SHOCKED at the fact the 2nd ingredient was MARGARINE i didnt realise they meant the brownies had palm oil in them lmao
5030 2018-05-14 14:10:21 I need windshield wiper fluid, gas and an oil change. Wish somebody would do it for me

5033 2018-05-14 14:09:56 Strange coming from the guy who funded ISIS buying their oil
5034 2018-05-14 14:09:47 Also, and check with your doc before taking medicines, but Magnesium is excellent for my migraines. Peppermint oil on a warm compress is heavenly! So is fresh air and... grr... working out.

5037 2018-05-14 14:09:44 That's a specific sect within the GOP :) Money and oil is the great unifier for them.
5038 2018-05-14 14:09:38 There isn’t just one input though. All of the energy stored in the earth’s resources (especially oil, for the past few centuries) is another input energy source.

5040 2018-05-14 14:09:33 Dropped the minivan at @DuxlerTire last night for an oil change today, completely forgetting the kids’ leftover pizza in the back. My apologies now for the smell…

5042 2018-05-14 14:09:23 The power of the CBD oil here in the states has meant I’ve hardly used my walking cane, and I’ve suited for hours, slept amazingly and has near 0 anxiety. I have never felt more normal for years. I’m so sad to be leaving it and the edibles behind :(

5044 2018-05-14 14:09:16 I’ve used Renew Gold and Dac Oil to get extra weight on Enzo. Both he gobbled down! If Fleur’s not picky straight oil would work and will be the least expensive route
5045 2018-05-14 14:09:15 There's no 'positive side' to evicting elderly people from nursing homes/assisted living centers - because you wanna save a few bucks to send to Oil Companies.

5047 2018-05-14 14:08:58 Really gotta wait THREE hours for a recall and an oil change what THEE fuck
5048 2018-05-14 14:08:58 Israel is the West’s plant in the Middle East. All the conflicts over the last 50 years are from western intervention for control of oil and other financial gains. Each terrorist group is an offshoot of a previous group put in place by western countries. It’s an almighty mess!
5049 2018-05-14 14:08:50 Red onion

5058 2018-05-14 14:08:17 Warmage Turmil & Warwitch Sh’ohch created these vessels of destruction. Each is an area spell contained within animated battle armor. When the armor fails, the suit explodes (2d8 DMG w/in 10ft) and the area spell is released. 
Here, the suit is filled w boiling oil, as well.
5059 2018-05-14 14:08:16 @CNBC  the S&P will benefit from rising oil ???   This girl has no idea what 3 dollar gas does to people's spending
5060 2018-05-14 14:08:07 This looks like my old oil pastel style! I had so much fun experimenting with color and learned SO MUCH doing these. I should buy a new set and get down on some color studies. Although I'm sort of sad I don't have the old ones to compare anymore.

5062 2018-05-14 14:07:58 So the increase in a product that uses milk as it's main ingredient is bad for the producers? Like using more gasoline is bad for the oil industry?
5063 2018-05-14 14:07:56 Ironically my hybrid car burns as much gas//oil as any old V8.
5064 2018-05-14 14:07:53 What the hell did Palestinians ever do you to call them your enemies?! They don't even have oil for god's sake.....
5065 2018-05-14 14:07:45 Gonna ship a few bottles of oil today and spend the rest of the day in the studio. #staybusy
5066 2018-05-14 14:07:42 Thanx bro. Smoked a j of blue dream rolled in keef and diped in oil , on a boat, saturday. 
Good f'n times
5067 2018-05-14 14:07:35 @realDonaldTrump Gas Heading to over $3.00 a gallon?  This will cost you dearly this fall. I don't understand why, if we are exporting more oil, we must pay world prices when it comes out of our ground. Other Countries don't do that to their citizens. I am starting to get pissed.

kau dapat bezakan oil&gas and marine pun dah okay dah
5075 2018-05-14 14:06:46 All these other companies are so tied up in the Economies of scale that they have side tracked innovation. They are just waiting for oil wells to dry up. Then cry and ask for subsidies. If every one of the giants contribute some R&D, this space might be evolutionary again!
5076 2018-05-14 14:06:31 OIL 1H that was the last push higher this moring as ALL indicators now exhausted higher. Consolidation lower next. Needs a deep correction lower to set up higher. WATCH

5078 2018-05-14 14:06:21 When you speak with a chef, and hasnt heard of Broighter Gold or rapeseed oil. Shock to start with! Lol

Then he proceeds to say, he only uses some sort of frying oil for all his dishes.... nice! 

Nice salads... nice dipping oil on your fancy menu! Etc lol

5080 2018-05-14 14:06:18 Because this is the only thing why people are fighting? ... because they are not even bit selfish and fight for oil or power ... What you say is total BS ... sorry man but religions are giving 99,999% believers at least some morals which hold them causing no more evil ...
5081 2018-05-14 14:06:07 You are spreading misinformation. 

Economic crisis? 

The unemployment rate dropped from 6.6% to 5.3%. 

Growth remains brisk despite it not being a national election year. 

FDI are at record levels.

Inflation is driven largely by global oil prices.
5082 2018-05-14 14:06:03 Idiot - my wife if from Venezuela and have many friends from there.  Go try it for a few months you live through it let me know.  No food, no medicine 83% poverty, 3rd oil reserves but no gas

5088 2018-05-14 14:05:43 In the era of the #metoo movement. Your client is out pouring oil all over her naked body in front of random dudes who are throwing money at her. Must be expensive to have Better Call Saul on retainer.

5090 2018-05-14 14:05:29 I've tried that earlier, but those roots became kadak and didn't reheat very well. Which atta do you use? And when you knead it, do you do it with water or milk or add some oil/ghee to it?

5093 2018-05-14 14:05:11 The price of gasoline in Canada is approaching a record high. The average price of regular gas across the country is $1.38 per litre, close to the $1.40 reached in 2008 -- when oil was selling for nearly US$150 a barrel.
5094 2018-05-14 14:05:09 My hair is so soft rn and I realized it’s ONLY because I put castor Oil on last night.

But realistically...it doesn’t look greasy so I can go out in the wild and no one would know how greasy I am.

5097 2018-05-14 14:05:00 The manipulation of oil and gas prices by producers and refiners is nothing more than legalized extortion!
5098 2018-05-14 14:04:59 I miss my last car more & more every time I have to pay $70+ for an oil change
5099 2018-05-14 14:04:57 @UPAllianceuk Is CBD oil legal in the UK? I see it selling on  Amazon as bud & oil along with vapes etc.
5100 2018-05-14 14:04:45 Hmm disappointed there’s not a recipe for popping with lemon olive oil (don’t use the fake flavored stuff—get it from a real farmer!), drizzling w/same, add salt, rosemary, tomato powder, freshly ground white pepper & a  glass of #SantaBarbara County Viognier. #Dinner
5101 2018-05-14 14:04:33 Why have the republican party courted the christian right and their vile rhetoric for so long? Hatred of Islam and Muslims while loving their oil shouldn't be an excuse. None of this is new for Jeffress and many other so called faith leaders. The hypocrisy ofis embarrassing.

5109 2018-05-14 14:03:32 @SurreyCouncil clearly have a lack of understanding about the oil and gas industry. They need help
5110 2018-05-14 14:03:22 Board member says most people are more concerned about what could have happened if the dents to the Enbridge line had been holes. 
"If we were trying to respond to an oil release on April 2, what would the situation have been?” he said.
5111 2018-05-14 14:03:22 One has to wonder about the role of oil interests in shaping the decision to pull out of the Iranian agreement!
5112 2018-05-14 14:03:21 But if you like him you forgive everything ... Kennedy’s family corrupt - LBJ took his to Vietnam falsely (Gulf of Tonkin) ... NIXON ( watergate ) - Jimmy carter ( high oil prices and was a mess ) - Reagan ( took us out of Cold War but ran up deficits and debt ) - BUSH 1,...
5113 2018-05-14 14:03:11 Petrol prices# govt says oil company decide prices and they dont have any interference . But last 15 days no price change, and as polling done in karnataka they increase price today only. Now if we say they lie? Are we correct or not?

It has worked for centuries. 

I am requesting no money and would like everyone to have a 100% share in the commen sense business.
5120 2018-05-14 14:02:11 I’ve only used CBD oil 2 nights and I already notice myself sleeping better and being more alert and relaxed during the day. Excuse me while I go buy in bulk.
5121 2018-05-14 14:02:07 I am just never going to make potato latkes ever again or attempt to make them because the oil kept spitting at me and I needed an umbrella for oil!!!

5127 2018-05-14 14:01:32 Are you still here? You've probally never been a game. City have had fans for like 6 years. Just an oil club. Fair play to winning the league like city did. No one else came close. Reaching 100 points is crazy. But they have to do it again consistently
5128 2018-05-14 14:01:25 Not up to the international community. They have no rights over USA law..  The U.N. is run by Arab oil and is a failed organisation. What peaceful solution the Arabs have never wanted one. They seek Israel's destruction.

5133 2018-05-14 14:00:46 A term I that is bandied about a little too freely is “our European allies”. Who are they? Can you give a recent example of their support of the US? Even in the 1st Iraq war Europe ran to the defense of their oil rich ally Kuwait much more than in support of the US.

5136 2018-05-14 14:00:12 and i thought he made it pretty clear that reliance on high oil prices is a shitty economic policy for any country so no, war with iran would not "help" venezuela any more than a bandaid "helps" with a broken arm.
5137 2018-05-14 14:00:10 I have never understood why some Muslims get mad over everything. What has any Islamic country in the Middle East ever produced for humanity besides oil? Their own Quaran doesn’t even mention Jerusalem at all, but it’s in the Bible 650 times.
5138 2018-05-14 14:00:06 @iocolivenews Hello, I'm writing an article about Egypt rejoining the IOC for the Olive Oil Times. Would I be able to send some questions on the matter to someone at the IOC? Thanks.

5140 2018-05-14 13:59:59 Putin is fine with Israel killing Palestinians or bombing Iranian bases in Syria, hence he invited Netanyahu to Moscow to be chief guest at Victory Parade. All Netanyahu has to do is keep buying Russian oil.
5141 2018-05-14 13:59:57 Oil prices have been ramping up since we dropped out of the Iran deal. I watched the gas in upstate New York move up 60 cents in less than a week. Thanks Donny boy

5144 2018-05-14 13:59:18 It’s okay. Once I bought some clothesline, olive oil and a fly swatter for various uses and got all kinds of side eye at the register lol

5147 2018-05-14 13:59:09 Oil is the next bubble that's gonna blow. Rip industry. Oh and btw, anywhere else in the world oil is f'ing expensive. The US just had a good power over the market due to having power over the middle east, where the stuff is pumped up

5149 2018-05-14 13:59:02 Russia wanted sanctions lifted to pursue oil deals with US companies. Clinton wouldn’t support that. Clinton criticized Putin and the Russian incursion into Ukraine. Russia wants to put a wedge between US and its allies and NATO. Trump is easier to manipulate than Clinton.

5153 2018-05-14 13:58:53 It’s gonna be war - I have no idea when policy went to snipers there but it’s got evangelical & Russian money support markets all over it - Bibi agreeing with Trump on anything is just like WTF does Putin have on both? Also gas prices go up because folk think there’s oil there.

5173 2018-05-14 13:55:39 Of course oil prices fell. Fracking is the balance to disrupted foreign supplies.

5185 2018-05-14 13:54:33 Let's not forget oil prices are through the roof and Trump's 0.5% commission on Rosneft's sale to QAI is going up accordingly. Oh and of course Putin is happy. And Netanyahu. #TrumpRussia
5186 2018-05-14 13:54:31 Are each of those sections between the pillars separate markets, that, together, function as a whole market? That's what the prefix "Portuguese" means, right? (I am so sorry for this joke.)

I'll just assume it's a regular market with fado music and more olive oil varieties.

He uses people to get what he wants in a moment & discards them once he has it.
The embassy move is payback to Sheldon Addleson for the campaign finance/legal fees. The move on Iran is to empower a Trump associate in that country.

5276 2018-05-14 13:43:37 Imagine what our oil prices would be if Trump hadn't opened up oil/gas exploration/production in USA from all Obama's restrictions. USA now biggest oil producer in world, thanks to Trump.  
Weird, NE liberals import Russian gas while demanding sanctions on Russia?! Hypocrites.

5288 2018-05-14 13:42:42 Trump really came through for Putin getting oil prices up.  Russia is solvent again as a result and can afford to continue their war with the West and keep their economy viable.  Is Trump shedding debt to his creditors as well?
5289 2018-05-14 13:42:38 Bwisit oil price hike na naman!! Lakas maka punyeta
5290 2018-05-14 13:42:38 Use creams and oils! 

Start applying extra virgin olive oil in your nails once a day. The olive oil with make your nails stronger and less likely to chip. (Cocount or any tipe of oil will work too).

Yeah you might still be okay, but you’re not gonna have the really sweet gig your dad or uncle had back in the day.
5293 2018-05-14 13:42:07 Yes it will take time to open economy completely when you have a railways like giant owned by govt and moment u speak of privatization all hell breaks loose same with oil marketing cos and when govt owns them govt will control things for populism
5294 2018-05-14 13:41:57 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
5295 2018-05-14 13:41:56 It will be interesting to watch oil consumption rates as per capita earnings approach and eventually pass the $3,000/year mark in India.  Are they on the same path as China or different?
5296 2018-05-14 13:41:49 TRAFFIC ALERT!!!

an oil spill has caused lane closures on Nashville Hwy at Frye Rd.  Expect lane shifts and delays if you are travelling in the area.  We will advise when all lanes are back open.

5299 2018-05-14 13:41:44 Really? Because oil rig employment practices have been so open to women? Nursing (as opposed to more lucrative medical careers) have been so well promoted for men? No condescension or hypocrisy here. Those professions have been as subject to entrenched gender bias as any other.

5307 2018-05-14 13:41:04 2/2 Here in the oil patch there’s definitely an understanding that the left is opposed to hydrocarbon development and would prefer to go as close to 100% green as possible. 
Maybe the green jobs would backfill layoffs, but everyone doubts it, and there just isn’t as much (contd)
5308 2018-05-14 13:40:59 All I learned was that war with Iran would be good for Venezuela because oil prices would rise.

I mean this was all really shallow. No real information on how this country could be helped
5309 2018-05-14 13:40:57 Hahaha maybe he forget that in Congress TIME from 2004 to 2014 price of oil increase 34 to 72 means more than 100% in 10 year just classifying what are you saying Mrs @RahulGandhi

5312 2018-05-14 13:40:46 Curious. I wonder if they're aware of processes that can convert coal into gasoline. Though, maybe they're against oil because it's just so dirty--compared to dirty coal.

Next thing you know, we'll be hearing Vancouver, Canada wants to export solar energy...
5313 2018-05-14 13:40:32 To be fair, that's only because that is exactly what happened.

5407 2018-05-14 13:29:11 But Israel is a democracy with an independent justice system that put a president,prime minister or soldier in to the jail if found guilty!What about our justice system?Why no referendum for nuclear energy?Does Iran with oil,gas,wind&solar power need it?YES/NO?Let people decide

5483 2018-05-14 13:21:04 and it will benefit Russia big time, because the flow of their oil will not be encumbered by the middle east tensions, and price wise it will become more competitive on the world markets. So as a World leader in Putin's pocket Trump is doing a great job

5507 2018-05-14 13:19:12 Fracking is the process used in the North Sea oil industry for extracting oil.

5553 2018-05-14 13:14:03 I hope everything comes to light very very soon regarding Rosneft Oil money.  I’m sure it’s no where near the bottom of Cheetolinis corrupt iceberg.
5554 2018-05-14 13:13:58 Cool. Let's start again. I asked someone how to get deficit sub 3% of GDP. You said by cutting oil revenues to WM. That only helps if Scotland is net contributor to UK. #GERS show we're net beneficiary. So, either GERS are wrong, or your suggestion is useless. So, your source?

5590 2018-05-14 13:10:52 Why has oil not increased of late? Consider September '17. It was clear that OPEC+ cuts were impacting inv, but $ + levels remained cautious. It takes time to believe the data shows a legit trend. It's happening again, with mkt fear to + $'s on present data signals.
5591 2018-05-14 13:10:43 Please send us a tweet explaining your post-inaugural profit of $228mil from the sale of Russia's oil company shares to Qatar - as "broker."  If we know it, Mueller knows it - so start explaining, please.

5600 2018-05-14 13:10:10 Mr. Goldstein @TheTorontoSun. Nowhere in the Swart & Weaver paper your May 9 column references, do either S&W say, “all global oil production is an insignificant contributor to global warming,” as you say they do.  Nor does their data suggest it. #cdnpoli

5719 2018-05-14 12:57:51 That’s not accurate. Russia slowdown was planned for some time and also the result of one off administrative measures that actually reduced spending by only about 7%. Now rise in oil will boost budgets. SIPRI ignored those facts.

5734 2018-05-14 12:56:40 This and allowing China to drill oil in Alaska! The picture is becoming clearer that China is directly involved, along with Russia, and Trump admin, in the degradation of the US.
5735 2018-05-14 12:56:20 Palm oil was supposed to be an environmentally friendly alternative allowing undeveloped countries a sustainable harvest but instead its  turned into a monster destroying virgin tropical forest and wiping out species as the biological diversity is replaced with monoculture

5737 2018-05-14 12:56:19 Trump is no doubt happy about the rise in oil prices.  It's his present to Russia, Saudi Arabia, and all the countries that are lining his pocket.  No doubt he has interest in oil companies as well.  He is destroying us for his financial gain.

5804 2018-05-14 12:48:06 But wasn’t Tillerson part of this plan? Putin hand-picked him. Had the oil industry bona fides. Seems like he was executing - gutted the State Department. Perhaps his personal distaste of “prez” was too strong?
5805 2018-05-14 12:47:59 I do not hate Trump I hate his policies.  Hate the fact he plays to the person with the most cash to offer him. I look to the future and play out all his moves to what could and probably will happen. I knew when he hired Tillerson, that it was all about oil. I know Iran is oil.
5806 2018-05-14 12:47:56 っべー、変態と勘違いされちゃってるわー
5807 2018-05-14 12:47:47 Use old engine oil
5808 2018-05-14 12:47:35 One of my partners is circumcised and good lube is essential when he wanks. He uses astroglide. I find it a little greasy but better than most. I prefer gun oil, but he says it isn’t greasy enough! I think there is a bit of a trade off.
5809 2018-05-14 12:47:26 coconut oil is amazing! baby oil & olive oil didn’t do much for Emily’s cradle cap and coconut oil has finally done the trick! also SO good for her skin
5810 2018-05-14 12:47:25 45 knows exactly what he's doing. He's instigating a war in the middle east.Why?#Money A war in the middle east will drive up oil prices allowing oil cos. to make a killing along with govt. contract cos. like Lockheed.
5811 2018-05-14 12:47:21 The Govt have been losing their earnings  in increased prices for the last 3 weeks. So they were waiting for the elections to be over to get their butter after a long diet of skimmed milk. It will be claimed the Oil companies have done it, but the power lines are elsewhere.

5816 2018-05-14 12:46:34 I am also glad he pointed out the social programs were a net positive and that trusting your economy on just oil lead to the core of their issues.

I am also going to guess tankies will not be trilled with his portrayal of Maduro's Authoritative decisions.

But seriously. How best to reach out to you guys? what’s the secrecy squirrel way?
5827 2018-05-14 12:45:15 Interesting get out of jail free card. All a dispensary has to do is sell a medically necessary product such as oil and edibles that the feds are unwilling to regulate but courts have allowed.
5828 2018-05-14 12:44:56 And they would have got away with it too if it hadn’t been for a plucky little band of oil company CEO’s...
5829 2018-05-14 12:44:52 coconut oil!!
5830 2018-05-14 12:44:50 At least Forte Oil is... so you are good.
5831 2018-05-14 12:44:47 Were you in somber when crude oil price was $150.00/- barrel and yet price of oil was at Rs. 60/- ltr now where your cheer leaders were wondering from pillar to post protesting now it is still at $55.00/- but petrol at Rs. 80.00/-
5832 2018-05-14 12:44:36 Oil is going to 80
5833 2018-05-14 12:44:28 This point. I said, well, they went from mistakes in Iraq and you want to just bomb the oil. You know, Trace came onto The Apprentice. Every single poll, every single decision that I think you know the guard rails.
5834 2018-05-14 12:44:28 I keep encountering new kinds of oil that are supposed to be healthy and have various benefits. But is it worth it? Hard to say. Already have coconut and olive oils, cocoa butter and grass fed ghee. Thinking about avocado oil and MCT oil. My objection to MCT oil - it's unnatural.
5835 2018-05-14 12:44:21 Probably just take my car in for an oil change, and head to work today... But now I'll feel pretty good about getting it done! 
5836 2018-05-14 12:44:19 Just saw on TV that if you have 20ml of any oil a day it’s good for your heart. Who knew?? @KariByron

5839 2018-05-14 12:44:04 Hey, @SoapandGlory I absolutely loooove the Vitamin C face wash. It's a pity I can't buy it anymore due to my realisation that it contains palm oil. You can do better. We all can do better.  #stopusingpalmoil #savetheorangutans

5841 2018-05-14 12:43:58 Thank you. The original is oil on canvas
5842 2018-05-14 12:43:46 So 14 years to repay the debt you have created?? Actually you've created more than that. Got an idea for you. Get some royalties off our gas, minerals and oil and make multinationals pay their tax and that debt would be paid back in a year or two. The  ountry would be rich!

5852 2018-05-14 12:42:22 Have you tried CBD oil? Either tincture form or edibles... The research seems pretty solid.
5853 2018-05-14 12:42:10 Really doesn’t. 

Point is oil is still there in the most prolific oil producing region onshore US. With its >70% WI in the Held By Production lease, as operator #NTOG stands to benefit greatly from future drilling here

This all reflected in BP hedging & Wash. Fed. facilities

5857 2018-05-14 12:42:02 MOT day today. First BEV they've tested. Comments from the tester: 

"It's like brand new! There's no old oil covering everything."

 "There's nothing much to test."

"Is it on?"

It passed of course.

5871 2018-05-14 12:40:36 You can’t just kick them out. Especially with only the somali diaspora youth. Realise that there are people you spent hundreds of millions to get power in somalia. They’re not going to give away the 7th most oil rich nation away because some kids said so.
5872 2018-05-14 12:40:31 New alternatives are being developed rapidly. Soon whatever profitability in oil will be dwarfed by the advantages of moving to the new alternatives. 'The Man' can't stop it anymore.

-clean your ears with a non-fragrance soap
-you should wait at least 2 months between stretches, but don’t stretch if it hurts
-do lots of research before stretching

6074 2018-05-14 12:20:10 How ironic.  You cite the "military industrial complex" and "big oil" yet you're a self-avowed Hillary supporter.  How more hypocritical can you be? You're definitely not very smart..."canon" (duh - did you mean cannon?) fodder, are you?

● lots of blame on the oil crash and Maduro (good)

Saudi FX increased to $737B (They reached a record high of $737B in August 2014 before starting to fall)

UAE FX increased to $94B...

Nigeria FX depleted to $28B by Jonathan...

The same people blame the present & say we should forget the past....OK

6137 2018-05-14 12:14:03 Certainly  builders of this deal considered this downside, higher price of oil. The cost to the American driver over Trumps term, 150 billion.

6139 2018-05-14 12:13:55 Cannot say if it is intentional or not - but a lot of #45's recent actions are contributing to the rise is crude oil prices. Or at least that is how I perceive it.

6142 2018-05-14 12:13:42 You get the 'taste of fish' from the 'oil' ?

What genius is your tongue? What is its genre? 

Dude, the taste you get belongs to the spices used. Not the meat. 

Meat doesn't 'leak' into the oil, you know.

So, no you don't "taste fish" when you eat pakoras fries in the same oil

6156 2018-05-14 12:11:41 Of course. However it's interesting that the change can be consistently +/-0 when the oil ministry openly concedes its limited grasp of production levels from the northern Kurdish region

6163 2018-05-14 12:10:46 there is no hurry. when you accidentally think there is, while cooking when toddler sleeps, you might drop a bottle of olive oil on the floor, first kicking it around (in the air) without a top

6188 2018-05-14 12:07:30 And why is oil over $70??
6189 2018-05-14 12:07:26 More like £200k to NTOG. They will make that back quickly on the rise in the oil price and new production from the Twin Well and the G6 well that is being completed
6190 2018-05-14 12:07:20 Trump abandoned the Iran deal for two reasons, 1) Obama did it, 2) because we are out, oil prices have gone up which is a gift to struggling Russia.

6197 2018-05-14 12:06:27 I would say that nearly all nutritional studies are uniformly awful (epidemiological garbage) but why eat artificial, manmade crap when you can simply eat healthy, natural butter or coconut oil?

6199 2018-05-14 12:05:46 Hike in petrol and diesel prises today poses a very important question? Did the oil companies colluded with the ruling BJP govt to help the party win the Karnataka elections? If so, isn’t it amounting to using govt machinery for poll benefits? @Swamy39 @dhruv_rathee @ElectionComm

6205 2018-05-14 12:05:26 Trump made it clear that he views gulf states as tools. Provide him with oil, he'll provide you with protection. Disagree with him, he'll end his support. America doesn't have allies, but vassals.

6208 2018-05-14 12:05:09 Trump's "America First" is breaking the Iran Agreement  but letting  the China's company get around Iran sanctions but Boeing loses a 39 billion$ contract & 100,000 American job PLUS higher gas prices for us but helps the Russians sell more oil. Now he wants to help NK's economy.

6226 2018-05-14 12:02:31 America is an oil exporter now.  America is now energy independent.  America does not rely on foreign oil.  Canada had better start building pipelines and refineries quickly, or any and every geopolitical event will continue to affect your economy.

6230 2018-05-14 12:02:17 @TeamCoFH COFH world feature idea: link to generators so that both generate in a chunk, e.g. generate surface samples of an ore vein, generate underground oil and oil sand on the surface.

6250 2018-05-14 12:00:02 in a competitive market place there is always more than one buyer for valuable commodities.  A commodity differs from a service in that it has tangibility.  Something that produces commodities, an oil well also has tangibility.  The Internet produces intangible commodities.

6295 2018-05-14 11:52:56 Trump introduces rapid change. Obama had no authority to end Korean war. Trump will threaten and bluster but won't bomb Iran.

6314 2018-05-14 11:49:43 Of course he shouted it. Islam destroyed the Middle East now it’s out for the world. If the Middle East didn’t have oil, where would it be today??

6333 2018-05-14 11:46:17 trump tears up Iran deal & guess what?  It pushed up the price of oil (Russia's key export) to a 3 year high. trump's move also boosted the ruble, Russia's currency.  Coincidence?
6334 2018-05-14 11:46:06 @Erin_BurnettCNN 
I can't believe, that the white house is talking about jobs in China. Jobs for designers in the oil field are no longer around. 
The oil companies are out source design and drafting jobs to India.
We have a large number of people fighting for jobs.

6343 2018-05-14 11:45:13 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, if you want to save the benefits of your tax cut, reduce or eliminate the federal taxes on gasoline and diesel! Oil prices are rising and they are going to eat up every penny of extra cash created by lower taxes. #FACT

6356 2018-05-14 11:43:26 Hi Greg, we do lightly fry our products to set & crisp the coating. This also means our products can be cooked in your oven or under the grill instead of having to fry them at home meaning you don’t need to add any oil to them to prepare them. Hope this settles the debate! Thanks
6357 2018-05-14 11:43:23 The extended 2days off post election and the new appointment of council of elders aided with the cushioning from crude oil price hike just at the perfect timing in the midst of such market volatility are one hell smart of strategies i tell youuuuu

6360 2018-05-14 11:42:59 I agree JM, although Obama didn't control the global Oil Market, he did shift the Domestic Oil Leases to drillers that used them. Big Oil was sitting on them. It increased domestic supply lowering the price.

6364 2018-05-14 11:42:22 Inflation in 'fuel and power' basket rose sharply to 7.85 % in April from 4.70 % in March as prices of domestic fuel increased in line with rising global crude oil rates.

6465 2018-05-14 11:27:37 When the oil boom hit, the UK govt was advised to start an oil fund like Norway to give a buffer when the price of oil fluctuated. They elected to spend the money on the SE of England, London especially. Scotland recieved a tiny fraction of those revenues.
6466 2018-05-14 11:27:36 Your right, its the fault of the Liberals that oil is going up and that the Canadian dollar has dropped, both of which contribute to the price of gas greatly

6472 2018-05-14 11:27:16 Mate the thread has had many different topics. Exxon has always suppressed unfavourable data sets. It’s a very poor analogy and one that doesn’t actually address the claim re the oil and gas complete cock up of the policy. A better policy would be leave the oil and gas

This of course depends on what whether the oil can be extracted cheaply enough to generate a profit. If oil can be extracted in the US in vast quantities as now for $20 a barrel why extract at $50 a barrel?
6675 2018-05-14 10:57:06 Agree, but the squeaky wheel does gets the oil.

6754 2018-05-14 10:43:22 Can some explain this gas price thing to me please! So the price of a barrel of oil has gone up, so we pay 139 at the pumps but when I drive to work at 10:30pm at night the same gas station and others, have there gas at 119. So does the barrel of oil cost less during the night?

6921 2018-05-14 10:19:08 “Money changes everything” . It’s no coincidence that since your influx of oil money you’ve been winning trophies as opposed to being a mid table side or at your worst playing gillingham in a third tier play-off final . U play great football btw and should commended 4 that .
6922 2018-05-14 10:18:56 CBD oil is amazing stuff.  It helped me alongside the treatment I had for tongue cancer. It helped my mrs anxiety. CBD Balm pretty much stops itching, stings, eczema you name it. It is the elixir of life.

6929 2018-05-14 10:17:28 You get Bullet proof coffee by mixing black coffee and coconut oil. Is that what you are having?
6930 2018-05-14 10:16:46 So here's a short story for you @MoPNG_eSeva, @dpradhanbjp.
A good friend of mine got cheated while filling fuel at an Indian Oil outlet in Chennai. She filled for a certain amount at night.
6931 2018-05-14 10:16:39 Like most US sanctions a work around will be established by those tired of "Team America World Police".  Sanctions just lead to shadow markets, like UN oil for food scandal.  Its about making markets for criminals.

Patrick Moore is an infamous oil company propaganda man btw. Google him.
6935 2018-05-14 10:16:03 CBD Oil helped me with my pain during radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is notoriously abhorrent with side effects, I came out 80% side effect free using it.  CBD Oil helps my mrs anxiety. CBD Oil isn't addictive, it's an amazing product. Simply amazing.

6941 2018-05-14 10:14:53 Fair point but politics is an incendiary field due to what’s at stake...we need to call out politicians on either side of the aisle who sell us snake oil...we also need to look beyond personalities and hone in on policy matters!

6966 2018-05-14 10:09:43 Where as the Russian Air Force use Syrian airports to attack ISIS from...because...

7018 2018-05-14 10:01:57 Thank God for clove oil.

7020 2018-05-14 10:01:17 Who and who are we paying too? Is it all those criminal  5 staff only oil company? Cronies of politicians?Or are we paying it to real major oil players? The only way subsidy would end is if 1. We begin to refine locally at least 70% of consumption or 2. We take away fix pricing.

7028 2018-05-14 10:00:11 Good. We need a far more active sense of urgency in our need to get away from fossil fuels. The technology exists for most of their use as an energy source to end & the only ones who truly benefit from it not being so are the 1% & their minions. Oil is going to run out soon.

7031 2018-05-14 10:00:06 Again, there was and is no difficulty to get fuel for these things. It's a 50:1 or a 33:1 mix of regular gasoline and two-stroke oil. The latter is still available at every gas station today, since many two-stroke engines remain in use in Germany (from chainsaws to boats).

He anointed his eldest son as his successor.

7059 2018-05-14 09:56:36 Specifically the implications of withdrawing GST, what mechanism do we use to replace the revenue from GST, the feasibility of reliance on oil etc. Again, not saying activists aren’t relevant to our economy; but to overhaul our current mechanism, our current CoE is fitting.

7061 2018-05-14 09:56:08 Shares of state-run oil marketing companies reversed intraday gains triggered  after announcing hike in fuel prices.
7062 2018-05-14 09:56:02 Gammanpila must be a real joker. Petrol was sold at Rs 150/- during MR era, while oil price was below $40. Today oil price is at $70 and recent fuel price hike in #lka is still reasonable compared to the previous regime.
7063 2018-05-14 09:56:01 As oil prices rise so will your wealth. Hmmm interesting
7064 2018-05-14 09:55:32 Yes, they are from upper middle class family with a business in sesame oil. Their neighbours even informed that there weren't anything strange about them and the father always go cycling with his kids every week. It makes us wonder how did they get brainwashed.

Whether the paupers that voted for him can no longer afford to bathe in cheap gasoline doesn't bother him, he's Dictator for life now.
7066 2018-05-14 09:54:43 In Astana, they realised that the economy was too reliant on oil. So they did a future impact assessment and set up the AIFC finance hub. I hope it goes well for them. I think it takes real courage to follow through with these ideas you know?

7074 2018-05-14 09:53:25 Yes.  I have seen the top one before and myself and several other people could not figure out what it was.  We thought it might be an ampule that could be used for oil or a tiny gun powder keg, but the others are too pretty to be used for that.

7079 2018-05-14 09:51:42 I can totally see him doing that.

The question is - regarding the competing oil pipelines is why would Qatar buy a share of the russian company whilst advocating their own pipeline? Why would russia want either of these pipelines to succeed?
7080 2018-05-14 09:51:39 Maybe if we start looking for the trillions of dollars stolen from the pentagon and the state dept. And if we stop bombing and warring for oil, we might not be in such rough shape financially? Oh and sending plane loads of cash to Iran? Might help.

7181 2018-05-14 09:34:57 Further price rises are on the way. Not so much to do with the government but by the action of one Mr Trump. His decisions and policies re Israel are guarantee to increase oil and gas prices worldwide within days. It's unavoidable.

7192 2018-05-14 09:31:18 Nice Chart Schism. Your Wave 3 in 2011 is probably an irregular B wave of 1 - the highs in #Gold #silver #copper were not confirmed by #oil & most other #commodities. Also your Wave 4 occurred at extreme pessimism - this can only make it a Wave 2. So maybe we are now in 3, not 5!

7229 2018-05-14 09:22:18 There is definitely something there.  Wasn’t there an early scandal involving a deal for Russian oil. Is this the same thing?

7413 2018-05-14 08:39:31 This is finance terrorism, since inception of this govt. & despite price of crude oil remaining on lower side, there has been no relief for genuine taxpayers & then we hear, for hike in oil prices govt. is not to be blamed. I think we must blame ourselves for choosing a thug govt

7420 2018-05-14 08:38:36 Obama must go put out his fire. Trump won't do it. They got the oil they wanted. He needs to be more considerate, at the very least.
7421 2018-05-14 08:38:30 OK 
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil and gas revenues or the 8% we get at present?
2) Do you think the scots that want too,are wrong to want to run their own country?
I predict you will get yer running shoes on rather than answer those easy questions
7422 2018-05-14 08:38:25 I have oil change on engine and retarder. Fuel filter also this time. And a lot of other check point. Then there was an error on the split part of gearbox. Had a bad CAN signal so it changed very hard. They planned all day on it.
7423 2018-05-14 08:38:14 That’s good to hear.  I was generalising about alternative therapies being available and explored.  I know about the oil being out there as I have seen it in the shops.  Smoking anything is not a good idea.  I agree.

7432 2018-05-14 08:35:54 What's the problem in that, how much price is increased from may 2014 till date?Had we not puchased fuel on much higher price before may 2014?

7449 2018-05-14 08:32:13 Depletion doesn't mean to completely use up something. If you have to raise the prices until nobody can afford it anymore or destroy whole coastlines for a few more million barrels of oil, depletion is in full progress.
7450 2018-05-14 08:32:10 The fuel hike means the following
 - Saudi wanted to bypass GOVT, and pass lower oil prices to Indians.
 - Modi kept it uniform, & used surplus to reduce fiscal deficit to 3.3%
 - So, Saudi's r pissed. So, they raised it now.
 - Now asking Leftist media to spit on the govt.

7471 2018-05-14 08:28:28 The Trumpcession is coming. Rising oil prices are an early indicator. When the price of oil goes up the price of everything else goes up.

Probable cause for colour change of Tag is due stack omission  flue

limit of SOx , NOx and unburnt oil

However industries should treat effluent for water recovery & recycle .

7838 2018-05-14 07:15:27 You want total deregulation. Privatize all oil companies. No more govt control in base rates of #Petrol. Want further reform. Put #Petrol & #Diesel under GST. Is any party including Congress ready for that?

Oil has come back from $US30 bbl in the last three years to be above $70 bbl....interesting that it is now a headline Wage growth is flat. Margin pressure for households maybe
7939 2018-05-14 06:54:59 Putin needs his wars to get the price of oil to go up.... Kinda like Dick Cheney and Halliburton when they needed 70 a barrel to frack....
7940 2018-05-14 06:54:58 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
7941 2018-05-14 06:54:31 what do you want from iran???!!   oil...
7942 2018-05-14 06:54:20 Enggak ko, justru katanya face oil buat yg oily justru bagus, aku pernah nyoba pake face oil dan kerennya bikin glowing 
7943 2018-05-14 06:54:11 The EU limits fracking, not that you'd care. Post-brexit the Tories are going to open the floodgates and let the oil flow. And you know it.
7944 2018-05-14 06:53:41 I was sincerely hoping that Ibushi at the very least would have ran his own shows with him and Nakazawa wrestling blow-up dolls covered in oil before returning to new japan.
7945 2018-05-14 06:53:18 なるほど
7946 2018-05-14 06:53:16 #Petrol Now the reason for hike is the rise in crude oil prices in international market! Makes no difference when prices fall

7953 2018-05-14 06:52:11 #Petrol fuel prices increased after a gap of 19 days. Am trying to ascertain whether the oil marketing companies are more worried about their profits, nations economy, public interest or elections.
7954 2018-05-14 06:52:02 .@netanyahu you're just as much of a fraud aka crook as @realDonaldTrump.  Your shit show a couple of wks ago displayed yur snake oil skills very well especially with the use of your fake props & information.

7961 2018-05-14 06:50:12 wasn't that oil deal the whole reason Tillerson was brought on?
7962 2018-05-14 06:49:59 Our fore father who were taken as slaves built America, the systematic way America invade a country all because of their oil, the systematic way America makes every country bend to their will for their interest and yet u are there condemning boys who are doing the job of a nation
7963 2018-05-14 06:49:42 すげえ...
7964 2018-05-14 06:49:29 Again telling u Mr Bhagat at dat time crude oil was 145$ nd price was 75₹ so there were min taxes imposed NW crude oil is 75$ nd price is 75₹ wid max taxes...so who is looting the public...current gov or last..I m waiting for Ur economic crisis nd misgov tweets as last time.

7972 2018-05-14 06:46:14 A barrel of oil was trading at $120 then while now at $70 is one reason
7973 2018-05-14 06:46:13 It isn't right to compare the price #Petrol just in $ terms. Even the exchange rate matters. Is the Modi Govt. Achaee Din? In a way yes. Compare our INR and Venezuelan(oil rich) bolivar in May 2014 and today. See the difference for yourself.
7974 2018-05-14 06:45:58 When UPA was in power, crude oil was US$148 per barrel. Today, crude oil is less than US$70 per barrel. While UPA was in power, petrol price did not exceed Rs.76 per litre. DISHONEST & ANTI-NTIONAL MODI IS TAKING Rs.50 PROFIT per litre Petrol and filling his coffers.

Buy an essential oil defuser & make sure it has an LED light on it. Put some lavender essential oil in it & turn it on in the bathroom. Cut the shower on & make sure the water is HOT. Close the door & let the steam build up for a few minutes.

7986 2018-05-14 06:44:30 Discussing credibility with someone who happily accepts fellowship at the Atlantic Council, which is funded by weapons manufactures, big oil, and gulf states - and directed by the likes of Kissinger - seems like a waste of time.

7990 2018-05-14 06:43:59 True, but with more efficient engines and a decreasing reliance of oil based products, a lack of discipline amoungs oil producers, with increased global production, it's not going to be the 70's again.
7991 2018-05-14 06:43:59 Another part of the ban game or snake oil orrrrr mom stories
7992 2018-05-14 06:43:52 Surely Trumps strategy is to lower oil prices. He is allowing drilling in Anwar and removing regulations. Isn't the higher price due to producers? Iran just happened.

Surely BP has downscaled it's drilling in the area due to such a huge dirty oil disaster? Nope! 

Anybody protesting that? Nope!

This of course has no correlation, with elections in Karnataka having just got over, none at all, the Oil Marketing Companies are free birds, as free as the CBI, they take their own decisions.

8088 2018-05-14 06:25:15 Telegraph admits that Scottish oil & gas was a key component of souths growth over past decades.
8089 2018-05-14 06:25:04 Could you argue that if Iran and Venezuela are already priced in, investment in oil&gas is due to rise in 2018 (1st time in 4-5? years) then $75ish is as good as it gets for Brent?
8090 2018-05-14 06:24:40 N and S Korea are bringing an end to their differences themselves.  Trump deserves none of the credit.  While stock market hits highs so does the cost of oil... we all will be dealing with a higher cost of living. Yeah, you can thank your dear leader for that.
8091 2018-05-14 06:24:38 Do you even know how much is the gasoline at gas station now?. Your actions are impacting other countries economy as well as the US economy. Whats the point of cutting tax, you erased them with higher oil price. period.
8092 2018-05-14 06:24:05 They will tell you that oil price was $100 and so on... that they met it at 20 dollars,for over a year now it's hovered above $50. Today it is over $70 yet nothing!!! As the saying goes a bad workman blames his tools, an irresponsible one blames his predecessor .

8094 2018-05-14 06:23:20 The govt promised release of oil to PSUs from the oil reserves in madurai,that is why there was a moratorium of price hike .
Only after the oil for Madurai reserves was shipped from Saudi to replenish it yesterday was the moratorium removed 
It has nothing to do with election

8097 2018-05-14 06:22:25 Reason #sowhat = Canada. U.S. imports very little oil from overseas anymore. If Canada cut off U.S. oil exports, that would be worse for Canadian economy than American. Demand for oil will fall soon anyway. At this point, the U.S. is energy independent enough. #mootpoint

8108 2018-05-14 06:21:13 Actually if we switched over to biofuels and other sustainable alternatives there would be no need for oil which has been the cause of war between countries the past 100 years and since then humans have been stuck in a loop. So yes, it could essentially be a key to world peace.

8114 2018-05-14 06:20:48 A bit of both I guess...the massive opec oil price rises in early 70s had a big economic impact and helped kill centreplan 70, there would also have been an impact on the hook road...which yes did generate lots of opposition

8134 2018-05-14 06:18:57 And there's your mistake. Dry skin needs moisture (water) and not oil. Also try using a body exfoliator 3 times a week to remove dead skin cells. It will allow better absorption of products. Avoid taking long hot baths/showers.

So are oil revenues for the both of them. Delink from America and interest rates need not rise. Japanese decades-old near zero interest rates is a good example.

8211 2018-05-14 06:02:56 Modi ji keep on hiking #Petrol even during crude oil slump by hiking excise duty again and again and now when crude is moving up they are not going to give any relief but why people are still powering them is beyond any logic
8212 2018-05-14 06:02:56 This oil money was used to construct drains and very good roads in my neighborhood in Mahama days. Don’t only see negatives always.

8231 2018-05-14 05:59:10 1.       Why India don’t take reactive action against this conspiracy of increment of international price of oil. It will good message to world that India is not going to look all this nonsense in dead mode.
8232 2018-05-14 05:58:46 You’re into cause and effect but refuse to consider the effect of oil when discussing rising co2 levels?

8239 2018-05-14 05:57:32 Scotland wanted to leave before brexit due to 1.tories 2.oil wealth. I don't blame them for 1. But 2. was shown to be a lie. Brexit is problematic for the SNP because 1. many of its own supporters agree 2. successful brexit wouldn't damage Scotland economically but unsuccessful..
8240 2018-05-14 05:57:30 Lmfao. See my meme was perfect  Norway  has a total population of 6 million. They are so rich because of oil and gas  we sit on the second largest reserves in the world and could be just as prosperous but people and governments block our prosperity. Nice try tho  Next
8241 2018-05-14 05:57:18 Alberta is 30 years ahead of the US on environmental regulations that oil and gas producers have to meet but in true American arrogance, that possibility would never even enter their mind.
8242 2018-05-14 05:57:15 As expected. And they say price of oil is determined by companies

8256 2018-05-14 05:54:37 Lastly, Al Gore would have an once of credibility if he first worried about the real dirty oil in the world, from regimes that still behead women in the streets and murder their own citizens for speaking out against the government.

8258 2018-05-14 05:54:17 More likely driving conditions/habits. Octane should not have an effect as it’s mapped for 87. Oil change can help, especially if it’s really bad, but unlikely a large percentage.
8259 2018-05-14 05:54:02 Sprinkle a little salt in your pan if you're frying. This will prevent the oil from splattering.

8265 2018-05-14 05:52:46 I'm surprised. The gear oil that came out of the Audi's transmission looked brand new. They must have changed it shortly before parking it.

...in 1996.
8266 2018-05-14 05:52:39 1.For e.g. IIT can suggest how can we make paper from PIRALLI which will stop North to become gas chamber in winter specially Delhi, Haryana and NCR or oil from flowers and other sources which will reduce imports bills of oil.
8267 2018-05-14 05:52:25 *countries that have oil reserves
8268 2018-05-14 05:52:23 Lol. When the Congress govt was in power, the price of oil was 150 dollars per barrel. And since 2014 it has been hovering around 50 dollars per barrel. Still no reduction in prices of Petrol and Diesel. 
Educate yourself. You are the one who is illiterate here.
8269 2018-05-14 05:52:17 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
8270 2018-05-14 05:51:59 Isn't this how the greedy oil companies justify the OUTRAGEOUS  FUEL PRICES we ate being subjected to? Please get a handle on this.
8271 2018-05-14 05:51:57 Prime News: Oil Retreats on Surge in U.S. Drilling Activity, Iran Sanctions Resistance: Oil prices edged down on Monday, pulling away from the previous week's multi-year highs as a relentless increase in U.S. drilling activity indicated an increase in production, while…

8273 2018-05-14 05:51:45 Similarly, we can make oil from waste of liquor like Sheera etc.
8274 2018-05-14 05:51:33 Obama’s latest scam to use Climate Change as an excuse to landlock Alberta oil ,while at the same time lifting the ‘70s ban on exporting oil out of the US, is an obvious play to profit on $40million a day differential to help pay off the Wall Street scams that he didn’t address
8275 2018-05-14 05:51:27 I 66  Advocate and media person both Congress and BJP concern for power busy creating wealth assets for self with help of corrupt Govt employees Today corruption and scam touched the sky and India number 1 in the world Are you people not ashamed I know Oil companies most corrupt
8276 2018-05-14 05:51:11 like shell oil, bio diesel from Ganna and other things from which extraction of oil is possible.
8277 2018-05-14 05:51:02 1.       Charging 5% GST on CNG Vehicle whether commercial or personal. It will increase green energy vehicle in India. And after 2025, it will cross total 75% of vehicle running in India. Can’t we develop indigenous sources of energy sources and oil
8278 2018-05-14 05:50:18 1.       Importing CNG and PNG in more quantity from Iran and other these both energy independent countries at cheapest rate compare to oil price. We need to stop imports of coal for electricity in next 5 years. Local production of indigenous coal need to produce 24X7.
8279 2018-05-14 05:50:00 Good luck. Doesn’t work google oil pulling unless you already know what that is

8282 2018-05-14 05:49:25 I'm hearing with one ear that Abba Kyari has appointed his brother, Mele Kyari as Nigeria’s National Representative to OPEC

8284 2018-05-14 05:49:04 time has come to review oil policy.
8285 2018-05-14 05:48:57 1.       Time has come to say to OPEC sorry we can’t afford costly price of your oil. Hence, we are unable to import oil from OPEC. Thank you very much. Imports of oil from OPEC are fruitful till indigenous sources are cost expensive compare to import oil price. Hence,
8286 2018-05-14 05:48:46 Wondering why cant Congress takes Oil companies to court for this?
8287 2018-05-14 05:48:46 Bro did you watch Rizin the other night? That guy from  Suriname? Who wants to teach MMA to poor kids in his country ? he got caught with oil or something all over his body on way to ring.. They even yellow carded him the minute he stepped in.LMAO hilarious..
8288 2018-05-14 05:48:38 It getting hot in Washington and the chickens are frying in lying oil.
8289 2018-05-14 05:48:24 Oil marketing companies have started regulating petrol/diesel prices starting 6.00 AM today after a gap of 19 days, 2 days after Karnataka elections. Embrace yourself for the price spike to follow
8290 2018-05-14 05:48:21 1.Stopping publications of news related with green fuel and e vehicle policy in news papers and media and at international which will increase worries of OPEC and will provoke them to raise the price of oil. We need to reduce oil imports and dependent on import of oil.
8291 2018-05-14 05:48:16 #ThisDay 2013 - The London offices of BP and Shell were raided by European regulators investigating allegations they had 'colluded' to rig oil prices for more than a decade.

8298 2018-05-14 05:47:33 @GeoffCutmore @steve_sedgwick i think if oil price goes up then Commodity Currencies start to rise then it means not so much room remains for USD to get stronger ! unless trend changes !

8306 2018-05-14 05:45:15 But, as per usual, oil inc will make record profits, so it's all good. As for the peasants, well they'll be safer when they can't afford to drive as much. Not afford to eat? Obesity problem solved! #MAGA win-win!

8308 2018-05-14 05:44:37 I think what he's talking about is when the US armed and funded terrorist during the cold war as a way to keep the USSR out of the middle East in case they tried to get the oil there for another world war
8309 2018-05-14 05:44:33 lets speak about the refugee crisis, as well as the manipulation of oil prices,  and how iran manage to impact them.

8315 2018-05-14 05:43:38 As anticipated after Karnataka elections, petrol and crude oil prices have risen after remaining static for the period of 19 days. Petrol and Diesel prices were last revised on 24th April 2018! 
#KarnatakaElections2018
8316 2018-05-14 05:43:34 She is short of memories, it was her party when in power gave the oil companies free hand to fix prices on daily basis. Everyone in Congress towing Sivaganga Seeman's line, forget their own policies!
8317 2018-05-14 05:43:28 Pure drama between the govt and oil companies
8318 2018-05-14 05:43:11 Is oil companies the agent to loot the people on behalf the government? #Petrol #Diesel
8319 2018-05-14 05:43:05 Look at the big picture: The economy is up because of standing economic policies. But those policies are being torn up daily. So far: Stock market gains lost and now stagnant. Oil doubled in past 8 months. China is no longer buying US soybeans, 1/3 of our total crop.
8320 2018-05-14 05:42:44 Even if they turn a blind eye amid killings at Kapedo, they will not stop us from interfering about oil plans @GovernorNanok @HonLomenen @loree @JennipherNawoi

8342 2018-05-14 05:38:00 Can it see russias oil and gas drilling operations, environmental impact, international agreement broken.
8343 2018-05-14 05:37:54 Please pass me the cbd oil.  And a beer mug.
8344 2018-05-14 05:37:43 I’m a firm believer that oil of oregano fixes everything
8345 2018-05-14 05:37:39 Sounds like your dream family home would be next to an oil refinery. 
Can I help you with that?


8346 2018-05-14 05:37:20 おめでとうございます
8347 2018-05-14 05:37:14 Also make sure to drink as much water as possible and get extra electrolytes. The hardest part for me. You will know if you need more. My calfs will cramp up, mouth will be a desert, breath will be worse. Definitely take some vitamin supplements and check out mct oil.

8349 2018-05-14 05:37:06 I have been in denial that it's getting hot out, but my coconut oil is no longer solid and I can't hide from the truth any longer.
8350 2018-05-14 05:36:57 So I’m tired and my dry skin is keeping me away... i went to open my coconut oil.... and when i did it spilt everywhere. 

Everywhere. 

How do i get this out of carpet??
8351 2018-05-14 05:36:55 LOL...IDF... nothing but terrorists.. You should fit right in. Go invade another country for bankers and oil companies pawn.
8352 2018-05-14 05:36:54 Ever since I started using rosehip oil my skin is a lot clearer
8353 2018-05-14 05:36:51 The oil companies will get right on it. . .
8354 2018-05-14 05:36:43 I am disappointed at the Arab nations. Despite all their oil  wealth, they have looked the other way while Israeli throws Palestinians under the bus . They could have been the most vocal proponents of a two state solution. How safe do they think they are while Syria and Yemen go?
8355 2018-05-14 05:36:32 My impression is like many things the new plants will put the older less efficient plants out of business but demand won’t grow anywhere near the amounts people expecting. Petchem seen as the biggest driver of oil demand growth going forward but think is being way over estimated
8356 2018-05-14 05:36:28 Also, if Alaska residents receive money for oil, why are Michigan residents not receiving profit % from their water..being stolen. Would like to hear the research and various perspectives about the water issues in Michigan. Thank you for reading/considering.
8357 2018-05-14 05:36:24 No.  The PM is an employee of Canadians. Canada is a country, not a business. (It certainly wasn't a Texas business last time I looked.)

8362 2018-05-14 05:35:22 Do u know international situation in oil market ..US getting out of Iran deal force oil prizes to hit 77$/B so its likely praise wil increase..( not considering taxes yes gov can reduce it )

8376 2018-05-14 05:33:14 Yeah, just we need some oil from Arabs to make it 
8377 2018-05-14 05:33:13 Any amount of green energy jobs should be welcomed. Taxpayers have funded foriegn oil long enough with no benefits, just debt.
8378 2018-05-14 05:32:15 If the government could find a way to extract the oil from my nose, gas would not have to be 4$ a gallon
8379 2018-05-14 05:32:13 Those who have done mathematics in class XI & XII can easily understand this. 
Price of #Petrol & #Diesel are inversely proportional to #Elections .
The Oil Companies are Directly proportional to # BJP Govt.

8445 2018-05-14 05:21:43 So agree...Citz United is a nightmare to democracy. And i think in part Trump got out of the Iran Deal cuz Adelson, a huge DJT donor per Citz United, hated the Deal. So oil prices going up. Israel launching attacks in the Golan, Trump made Adelson  very happy.
8446 2018-05-14 05:21:42 As expected! Who is controlling the oil companies? We want to know.
8447 2018-05-14 05:21:42 May be paranoia but it's interesting how oil prices are heading upward . . . Realize that Putin's ONLY source of income comes from oil and gas. Hard times before Trump elected when oil/gas prices fell to below $50/barrel. Just a thought . . . #TrumPutinLove

8449 2018-05-14 05:21:22 The price of petroleum products hikes just after Karnataka reveals that public sector oil companies are not independent. NDA govt is making fool of us.
8450 2018-05-14 05:21:14 That's not the news. It's only been reported in right wing nut job sites. Kerry knows leaving the agreement is insane. Trump did it to enrich Putin, Russia, etc. by increasing oil prices since he couldn't lift the sanctions. Putin has already made billions.
8451 2018-05-14 05:21:03 Do you think leaving the Iran deal is just to boost his .05% stake in Rosneft as oil prices rise?

Regardless of the new section of the pipeline being constructed or not, the world is still going to consume the same amount of oil. With pipeline, world consumption=99MBD. W/O pipeline, W/C=99MBD.

Transplanting souls from expired soil
Shifting poles and syphoning the oil

It's the only way to fix any foible
8475 2018-05-14 05:15:48 This goes from worse to obscene the twists and turns and every oil and oligarch and IAE and Qatar etc. What a disgrace. I don’t know if I can ever forgive Trump voters. This was the dumbest thing they did in all their lives.

8477 2018-05-14 05:14:45 Venezuela will take decades to recover from the current crisis. It's long and hard road ahead. To make matters worse I don't see oil price going back over $100 for a long period. With almost everywhere moving to renewables and electric vehicles, oil consumption is on the decline.

8480 2018-05-14 05:14:01 Sirji Instead of hiking Petrol & Diesel prices, mismanagement in oil marketing companies should be stopped. There is no improvement in their working in last 4 years. No cut down in their operating costs.Employees are rewarded lavishly on many occasions.Let there be tax cut.

8612 2018-05-14 04:50:16 Um actually I’m a snake oil client services specialist.
8613 2018-05-14 04:49:45 Indeed - plus the reward in savings  of having to import less oil/gas. 
Couple that with increased uptake if #EVs... win-win-win!

8620 2018-05-14 04:47:49 It's all for business.. Repeal environmental regulations to increase profits, etc. Trump is a businessman (a,bad one) who associates with the people who got rich from coal and oil. He doesn't care about the environment and wants to frack off everywhere but
8621 2018-05-14 04:47:43 sarah - I'm impressed how you burn the midnight oil.  keep tweeting 24/7 - I always need my fix!
8622 2018-05-14 04:47:32 @realDonaldTrump  so what happened to our oil independence and the price of gas?

8625 2018-05-14 04:47:15 Protest exists against fossil fuels in all major democratic nations that export oil. 

Stop acting obtuse.

Rub meeeee down with some 
Hot oil baby
And I'll do the same thing to you
8628 2018-05-14 04:46:44 Govt uses oil taxes to control prices, nothing wrong with it. Need to keep inflation in check. Re the timing, tell me if Congress won't do the same. E.g. Congress proposed separate religion for Lingayat just before election code of conduct. Why?
8629 2018-05-14 04:46:09 Yeah you gotta go organic because I've looked at rose hip oils in store before where the main ingredient isn't even rose hip oil
8630 2018-05-14 04:45:22 And the longer the winters are the more oil and gas and coal Alberta would sell.
8631 2018-05-14 04:45:13 I need an oil change
8632 2018-05-14 04:45:11 I definitely need this kinda Dr. Injections and I = oil and water. 
8633 2018-05-14 04:45:06 Why waste 1000scrores on ev , old vehicle, announce 10 crore prizes for New energy, batteries techs, winner gets market, save 2lakh crores oil imports, reduce pollution, more rain!
8634 2018-05-14 04:45:02 Digging an oil field in this store is prohibited!
店内で油田を掘るのは禁止です！
8635 2018-05-14 04:44:41 Then go ahead and make them and reduce future use of fossil fuels. Didn't need all the math and diagrams to figure that out. Wind, water, solar that should be where our power comes from but the oil and coal industries won't benefit from  cleaner fuel or Earth
8636 2018-05-14 04:44:41 Right idea wrong house. That telecoms deal, um rethink that. That floating nuke in the Arctic when oil rigs are self-contained, suspect! JT needs eyes in the north. Iran is in checkmate by pushing to hold a deal with Europe.

8638 2018-05-14 04:44:36 @arunjaitley The rupee breached the psychological barrier of ₹67 against the dollar  amid strong demand for the U.S. currency from importers, as crude oil  rose to $75 a barrel. @narendramodi @AmitShah @RBI @RahulGandhi
8639 2018-05-14 04:44:32 Dem. Rep. Cohen, you should be ashamed of yourself. If you said those things about a woman, or a minority, they would run you our of town on a rail. They need to reboot that time honored way to deal with Democratic Snake Oil Salesmen.

8642 2018-05-14 04:43:48 In the case of gas and oil harvest, massive indemnities would apply against spillage all the way along the value chain. Solar and wind spillages by contrast result in pleasant weather (or at worst, less unpleasant weather).

8644 2018-05-14 04:43:41 That’s awfully myopic. Do you count wind or solar, as energy projects? It seems that these are booming categories although they, by nature, don’t require billions in infrastructure. Or is it that you just want the government to spend billions on oil infrastructure?

8646 2018-05-14 04:43:38 Borrowing to pay salaries, setting jumbo salaries and allowances for politicians when the means of payments is borrowing or revenue accrued from crude oil, accommodating ghost workers and ghost salaries earners in govt payrolls are indicators of imprudent management of resources.
8647 2018-05-14 04:43:08 make it snow :)

It’ll take like 5-10 attempts before you find a recipe you personally enjoy.

My safe recipe:
Extra virgin olive oil (presses can vary to your taste or quality)
Minced garlic
Oregano (not too much)
Grated Parmesan
Salt (not too much)
Black Pepper (not too much)

8678 2018-05-14 04:35:20 Actually, the material in the tailing ponds is much cleaner and less toxic now that the bitumen has been removed from it. In Alberta, we are hard at work cleaning up Mother Nature's gigantic oil spill, which has contaminated the soil for millions of years.

8735 2018-05-14 04:26:29 I guess my point is really, these two issues are not necessarily related. The demand globally is increasing while there is also risk in other oil producing countries putting at risk supply. So, the main drivers of prices increase is seasonality, demand and election risk. Nice try

8746 2018-05-14 04:24:15 It's really great to see what is lacking in your relationship, the communication, fun, excitement, connection, etc. But knowing what's lacking you can start working your relationship better again, it's like pouring oil in the small fire that your relationship currently have.

8755 2018-05-14 04:22:34 You apparently haven't been paying close enough attention. The cost of oil has doubled in the past 8 months. China is no longer buying ANY soybeans from the US which accounts for 1/3 of our total crop. The stock market has lost nearly all the gains and is now stagnant.

8766 2018-05-14 04:20:36 Prior to the deal Iran cut back their financial support to hezbollah due to sanctions and falling oil prices (Curtailing their pol/social/military activities). The sanction relief due to JCPOA increased funding to hezbollah, enabling it to push back.

1-2 tsp raw honey 
Mix with hot water

-Cohen was working w/ a corrupt Qatari businessman unhappy w/ Iran deal since it cost his company massive oil revenue
-ZTE was violating sanctions w/iran + more

This is all connected somehow

8851 2018-05-14 04:06:49 I'd say that relief from crippling sanctions, disbanding of NATO & access to a critical oil pipeline/reserve in Crimea are great reasons for Russia to ensure that THEIR preferred candidate wins a US Presidential Election.

8911 2018-05-14 03:54:28 Cheney should be in prison. Today he's also a stakeholder in an oil & gas exploration company based within the occupied Golan Heights. He's busy cozying up to the Rothschilds. Hardly impartial but it doesn't matter in the world of Fox News. Oh, Rupert Murdoch has a stake too.
8912 2018-05-14 03:54:24 I've tried toothpaste and it didn't really help. The tea tree oil is actually the only thing helping it currently 
8913 2018-05-14 03:54:23 I beg your pardon, small islands with little resources, we still have vast recoverable oil and gas resources in the North Sea. We have a vast network of inland waterways and old coal and tin mines.  Based on isolation we also have a resourceful native population.
8914 2018-05-14 03:54:19 Sounds like oil barons too
8915 2018-05-14 03:53:46 Exactly- it is not clear if the oil is highly refined or what. I’ll be calling @MayfieldScoop in the AM to learn more!

8918 2018-05-14 03:53:17 True.  However, the flyover states control the oil & coal, much refinery capacity and most of the food production. A lockdown would set all parties back. Playing along w/his scenario I’m thinking everyone would come to see value in cooperation

8966 2018-05-14 03:44:52 I've told you before, opposing Canadian oil hurts many people. There's no fence sitting. Meanwhile you type on an electronic device made from oil, maintained by oil: that's hypocritical.
8967 2018-05-14 03:44:37 Why is one arab a billion Indian rupees? Guess our ancient economists always knew we’ll never catch up with their oil money 
8968 2018-05-14 03:44:33 Ya. Nothing to do with the “oil” economy. 

Nothing like phasing out oil as an economic driver to up the happiness factor.
8969 2018-05-14 03:44:32 #KapedoUnderSiege it is so shameful to see Uhuru run after Turkana oil when the people themselves are being killed by one greedy community called pokot.  Does it mean that pokots are doing that in consultation with Uhuru and so called Kamkatet?

9007 2018-05-14 03:37:48 Not *just* narcissism. Given that ending Iran deal also means increased oil prices which benefit Russia & its ally Iran, it's also consistent with Trump following orders. Watch oil prices and their respective currencies & see why Russia's happy.

9028 2018-05-14 03:34:44 Are you nuts? #Trump is continuing to openly finance jihadists to overthrow the government of Syria including re-badged AlQaeda. He’s helping ISIS thrive, like Obama & Bush did to overthrow countries to steal oil.
9029 2018-05-14 03:34:43 No es lo mismo , con todo respeto estás desinformado. Estos señores de OIL. Son unos perversos. Y evasores. No pagaron. Los aportes durante años y así estafaron a sus empleados y ni siquiera pagaron las indemnizaciones de despidos. Y tengo pruebas .
9030 2018-05-14 03:34:37 there is absolutely NOTHING  I love more than laying in my bed, journaling, & listening to music with the oil diffuser & Christmas lights in the background
9031 2018-05-14 03:34:15 They don't need to hold political office to have power.

You came into this thread selling your snake oil in response to someone complaining about bigotry.

If you think me not ignoring rudimentary context is "putting words in your mouth", you may feel free to jump up my butt
9032 2018-05-14 03:34:00 So, Trump's trying to shore up his base.  Get rid of Iran deal, higher gas prices is a two fer.  Russia makes more money and so do all those rich donor oil companies.  Work with China on ZTE, maybe get those crops flowing and appease hi digruntled base.

9050 2018-05-14 03:31:33 So let's take at face value the claim musk is trying to solve any problem other than the numbers in his bank account not being big enough (lol). Your thesis is that socialism... propped up oil for vehicles? Prevented people going to space? Fought against solar power?
9051 2018-05-14 03:31:21 Context is everything: Placerita production = 5,196 b/d in 2013. Alberta oil sands production = 2.8 million b/d. California's entire crude oil production is only around 550,000 b/d. Why not focus on AB's efforts to LOWER carbon-intensity?

9053 2018-05-14 03:31:14 I remember early on Roseneft was in the news and I said then- watch, this is ALL about oil. Sure enough the dots are being connected.

This is huge news.
9065 2018-05-14 03:29:39 On Sep.14,2013 crude oil price was $109.47 per barrel;diesel in Chandigarh then was ₹52.39/litre. Today crude is at $72 and diesel is historically highest at ₹64.01. Why so? Govt has collected  ₹ TEN LAKH CR. extra in 4 yrs from hiked excise duty.This also led to price rise.

9099 2018-05-14 03:22:54 Best way to keep weight off: eat quality fats/fiber/carbs eg dried beans that won’t spike blood sugar.

9115 2018-05-14 03:20:51 And it isn't helping American coal workers- its benefiting Russian oil.
9116 2018-05-14 03:20:51 Okay so the shine will probably be ruined, but you can get it back with polish after they’ve dried. When they’re mostly dry (not totally-you want to avoid cracking) ~very lightly~ oil them. Olive oil, vegetable oil, doesn’t really matter just put a very light layer outside only

I forgot to check the oil and kept driving it even when it sounded a little funny.  Ruined the engine.  SORRY MOM!
9118 2018-05-14 03:20:42 Ambient temperature has an effect on product vis. The heavy oil has the same properties. The operator will dial diluent input up or down to manage pressure. (Ie: more dil in winter)

To be pedantic, pipeline pressure is generally measured in kPa, not MPa. We’re not gas guys.
9119 2018-05-14 03:20:39 These countries are full of resources. That have been looted throughout history. Full of Coco leafs, lithium, gold, oil etc...The Jews that occupy Israel are of European descent who escaped Nazis. The Canaanites occupied that land for thousands of years.
9120 2018-05-14 03:20:35 No. Most of the complaints revolve around too many tax breaks for the rich, and not enough for the middle class. Secondly. There are dozens of ways you can help US companies, outside of taxes. Like, and I’m just spitballing, not sending oil prices skyrocketing.

9130 2018-05-14 03:19:25 This continues to conflate medical and recreational cannabis, though. They're not the same, and the parallels with alcohol are strained for that exact reason.

9146 2018-05-14 03:15:39 US refineries process heavy crude, like that from Venezuela and Canada.  Fracked oil from USA is sold onto the global market.  
The price your seeing isn't production cost--it's risk cost and it's largely created by #MAGA man and his ditching the Iran deal.
9147 2018-05-14 03:15:35 The article falsely pretends that this is just about gasoline and not about simply upgrading bitumen to oil. 

The author also ironically destroys the oft repeated right wing narrative that pipelines would stop imports of oil and gasoline.  

So it's right about one thing.

9180 2018-05-14 03:11:21 > oil, our oil industry can’t sustain us, and even if it could would be subject to the slings and arrows of global commodity markets we can’t influence?

9188 2018-05-14 03:09:46 Why are the Greens so concerned with Alberta oil while saying little about the coal (high emissions) shipped out of Vancouver or the oil shipped in
9189 2018-05-14 03:09:39 Does Trump pulling out of the Iran deal and saying he would have taken the oil fit into this?

It's also sad well bc he died never seeing how we see his art today.

Crude oil prices are looking to the monthly market update from OPEC as well as EIA statistics on US drilling productivity to inform supply trend expectation...
9202 2018-05-14 03:07:44 Understood. You realize they were running a money laundering scam.  Oil/Weapons/Human/Organ Trafficking and allegedly murder.   Among other things.  Doubt Hyde would be a concern. #Rigged

9221 2018-05-14 03:05:26 I totally think this is about an oil deal. Obama put sanctions on Russia killing a $500 billion deal with Exxon. Russia gets Trump in office. Trump hired Rex Tillerson, who struck up the deal. Oil prices are rising. Trump will save the day with a new deal.
9222 2018-05-14 03:05:03 this oil meme is really cool

9250 2018-05-14 03:00:21 Donnie also covertly invested in the Russian oil giant Rosneft via Qatari investors. He’s making money on the oil run up — which is the rationale for Iran and the Israeli embassy move. This is a big crime syndicate play!

9267 2018-05-14 02:56:57 and however many deaths, we destroyed their country on the notion of WMDs, which has since been debunked. Guess our oil companies just accidentally profited from it tho lmao
9268 2018-05-14 02:56:56 It does ;; hoping by the end of this year I'll figure something out, CBD oil has been getting me by though ;u;
9269 2018-05-14 02:56:50 Thanks! I give them a lot of variety. They get various suet cakes, some are berry or high energy, I also hang up one that has dried mealworms in it. I also provide a lot of black oil sunflower seed, as well as blends that feature sunflower seeds & dried fruit and safflower seed.
9270 2018-05-14 02:56:50 Go home Al-you have ZERO to contribute so HIT THE ROAD. THE ROAD PAVED USING OIL!!!
9271 2018-05-14 02:56:38 Great news.  #CBD oil extracted from #hemp is #legal in all 50 states b/c of 2014 Farm Bill section 7606.  The 2018 Federal budget bill renewed federal protections for the cannabis industry.
9272 2018-05-14 02:56:36 @nailogical you should sell your nail oil pens. I’m sure I can buy/make my own but your concoction seems perfect. Make your own and put your own label on them and sell them as merch!!!

9274 2018-05-14 02:55:57 When I look at how much gas to get to work, and oil to heat my home - have gone up dramatically under Trump,... Add that to his healthcare BS cost increases and that 'tax break' vanishes. I bet for 90% of us all
9275 2018-05-14 02:55:53 Yeah I don't like most sauces either but on a cold sandwich I need something like a little mayo or oil & vinegar maybe red wine vinaigrette.
9276 2018-05-14 02:55:46 Pffft, I could have told you that. The BEST hot sandwich in the world. Which one did you get?
9277 2018-05-14 02:54:47 Has he spoiled you with any of his oil field money! If not that ring better be no less then 5k
9278 2018-05-14 02:54:37 Technology is out there that you can make anything out of plants that you can make out of oil. Limiting factors are costs and size of operation. These are areas to be investing in. We need to curb our mentality that oil is king.
9279 2018-05-14 02:54:16 Mix castor oil, coconut oil and badaam oil. This is what I use.
9280 2018-05-14 02:53:48 I expect compassion clubs will stay open once they realize the need is still there, and from there we'll have to see. If government allows the clubs to quietly sell hash oil to medical patients, it should hold the status quo. Of they move to close em, the courts will wade in
9281 2018-05-14 02:53:42 The only definition I’ve come across is from the AER and it’s based on where the oils produced; nothing chemical. The AER matched the regional boundaries of their field offices in Bonnyville and Wainwright w/ what production was heavy oil and what was bitumen
9282 2018-05-14 02:53:41 The full wash is my bedtime wash. Note: I am very sweaty, have rosacea, get over heated easily, and wash my face with oil.
9283 2018-05-14 02:53:30 The illusion of free trade is one of the biggest magic tricks western capitalist corporations have ever deceived the public with. Most major oil corporations (BP, ExxonMobil, Texaco, Shell) began as Standard Oil, a cartel that divided the world up into areas for plunder in 1928.
9284 2018-05-14 02:53:23 Has he ever thought what goes into creating a terrorist?  Maybe a culture of violence and oppression? A disregard to human rights and human value?  A desire to profit off another country’s oil? Valuing money over humanity? Cheney is an evil man!
9285 2018-05-14 02:53:20 You do know alwaleed bin talal that the moment your country runs out of oil you gonna be back to the old ways of riding camels and get your head at the exact right place where it is supposed to be... #justsaying #syriableeds #palestinebleeds

Fooling people in name of decontrol.
9291 2018-05-14 02:52:42 I don't have any connection with ATSB but have friends in Auz and Tassy so know the real oil beyond the media.  There is a big upward in the aviation sector though so who knows what filters to the ATSB. Either way under find of 9M-MRO (Right) ICAO and Malay say its ATSB's ball.

9297 2018-05-14 02:51:33 If you live your life on the basis of policy saving you, you will continue to suffer for the rest of your life!

Not sure where you pulled ur stats of the Iraqi war either, ur number is 5x too high and what oil do we have that we didn’t have before? 

Sounds like conspiracy..

9299 2018-05-14 02:50:32 But Pakistan have some benefits regarding import of crude oil since it's an Islamic country. They have different arrangement with UAE
9300 2018-05-14 02:50:30 Oil Got Him SLUMPED 
9301 2018-05-14 02:50:25 Why did we want Iran or any nation to build a nuclear reactor? We don't want them built in our own country. Iran has so much oil they don't need nuclear energy!
9302 2018-05-14 02:50:20 That whole glowing globe, sword dancing nonsense was the after sex cigarette of a big, fat “Fuck Iran and take their oil” deal was made. You can just tell.

9305 2018-05-14 02:49:49 Oil tank cars?
9306 2018-05-14 02:49:46 Venezuela has $Trillions worth of oil. Why is it starving? Socialism/Communism is about removing the power of money, so that only one power exists. There's no such thing as a communal rule, can't happen, won't happen. If you pay taxes, you are a "socialist".
9307 2018-05-14 02:49:34 F u all snake oil grifters!
9308 2018-05-14 02:49:31 Update: my mom takes 1000 milligrams of CBD oil for her anxiety but still hates the fact that I smoke 
9309 2018-05-14 02:49:29 Fuck United Fruit (now Chiquita)
Fuck Standard Oil of new Jersey (now BP)
Fuck Standard Oil of New York (now ExxonMobil)
Fuck the Oil Cartels
Fuck all transnational corporations that play with people's lives like it's chess
9310 2018-05-14 02:49:25 It's helped me when I had a cold and I'm definitely not "that crowd" type. I was never into cannabis, but I keep CBD oil on hand for certain things. It helps with mild anxiety.

9316 2018-05-14 02:48:32 omg this was the oil I used today! your mind!!
9317 2018-05-14 02:48:21 Oh dear Donnie, so you covertly invested in a Russian energy company and then worked with the Qataris and Saudis to let the price of oil run up? Then you took actions ti stir up tension in the middle ease via Iran and Israel! You are a devious swine!
9318 2018-05-14 02:48:20 there’s less cocoa and it’s made with buttercream or something like that and more of some kind of oil smh sweaty 
9319 2018-05-14 02:48:17 When washing your face, use warm water ? if the water is too hot, you risk washing away too much oil and drying out your skin.
9320 2018-05-14 02:48:15 Calm down mechanic guy. Just here for an oil change. lf l wanted to know about all the other shit wrong with my car l'd turn the radio down.
9321 2018-05-14 02:47:55 yeah it looks awesome, like CBD is completely legal here but sadly we don't have easy access to getting those kind of products. CBD oil is very easy to get but finding food/drink products is not
9322 2018-05-14 02:47:53 I need another oil diffuser.
9323 2018-05-14 02:47:44 I hope she gets to follow that oil money to the farthest wildest coolest reaches of the Earth.
9324 2018-05-14 02:47:27 Oh dear Donnie, so you covertly invested in a Russian energy company and then worked with the Qataris and Saudis to let the price of oil run up? Then you took actions ti stir up tension in the middle ease via Iran and Israel! You are a devious swine!
9325 2018-05-14 02:47:12 Olive oil and balsamic vinegar is better
9326 2018-05-14 02:47:06 I understand you don’t like Trump but why do you say he’s working for Putin. What proof is there of that? Bombing Syria? Pulling out of Iran Deal? Building oil pipelines? Expanding our military? Modernizing our nuclear arsenal? Supporting Israel? Please let us know specifically.
9327 2018-05-14 02:46:47 ...an oil painting of me and a bunch of cats. That’s the picture it paints.
9328 2018-05-14 02:46:45 You can buy CBD oil at pretty much any health food store or online since it doesn't contain THC.
9329 2018-05-14 02:46:43 Donnie covertly invested in a Russian energy company and then worked with the Qataris and Saudis to let the price of oil run up? Then he took actions to stir up tension in the middle ease via Iran and Israel! It’s on film!! He’s a devious swine!
9330 2018-05-14 02:46:41 Sorry Rachel I for one will not be voting for you and your policies. You have doubled the cost to heat our homes and the working poor can not afford to heat their homes or drive their cars. You have not supported Alberta and the oil industry until you destroyed it with policies

9334 2018-05-14 02:45:47 I'm trying to cook spam while my cousin is making pancake. The oil keeps on going everywhere. WHY.
9335 2018-05-14 02:45:23 It's so much better to make your own! 3 yolks (organic eggs) 1 egg, 1 tbspoon vinegar, 0.5 teaspoon salt, 1 tbspoon mustard and 1 cup of olive oil, avocado oil, MCT oil, even coconut oil, butter or tallow (these warm), add fat little by little on high until it's done.
9336 2018-05-14 02:45:17 I have a fucking close crop of just that olive oil line saved in my stupid images folder and at some point in the past year i honestly forgot what i screenshotted it from and now im losing my mind

9338 2018-05-14 02:45:03 Thanks to my student’s mom, I’ve been into essential oils since January. 

I kicked it up a notch yesterday and bought an oil diffuser for my room. 

I put some lavender in it and sprayed my pillow with lavender and sage. 

I was out cold instantly.
9339 2018-05-14 02:44:42 They have enough for both can export all the oil they want and still meet their domestic demands. As for the second statement now your a nuclear physicist? Please And you never answered my question why not explore clean options like wind solar and hydro?
9340 2018-05-14 02:44:37 U do know Jeffress is a Christian fraud right.  He is a fake snake oil salesman selling mulligans
9341 2018-05-14 02:44:24 Why should we believe anything he says. The rest of the countries said Iran is living up to the deal.  I believe Germany and France over trump any day. His reasons are about oil 
9342 2018-05-14 02:44:21 Enjoying the thread.

You have to be careful in bifurcating bitumen and oil, categorically speaking. To the best of my knowledge, there is no authoritative chemical definition of bitumen. 

I’d love to be proved wrong.
9343 2018-05-14 02:44:13 You, FOLKS, AND I HAVE PROOF FROM THE BEGINNING. I DIDN'T WANT TO KEEP THE OIL. But WE NEED GREAT BORDERS. Because WITHOUT BORDERS, WE DON'T USE THEM. We USE POLITICAL HACKS.

9345 2018-05-14 02:43:41 I don't think the west keeping a failed rebellion from being destroyed is a great example of restoring peace to Syria nor is US bases around key oil fields.
9346 2018-05-14 02:43:36 CBD oil for coughs? No shit?
9347 2018-05-14 02:43:27 @ nominate myself lol why? Because I'm curious about my skin. It's generally clear but there's definitely room for improvements. Especially since I did the lemon oil thing before and coconut oil as well 
9348 2018-05-14 02:43:24 Oh dear Donnie, so you covertly invested in a Russian energy company, and then worked with the Qataris and Saudis to let the price of oil run up? Then you took actions ti stir up tension in the middle ease via Iran and Israel! You are a devious swine!

9355 2018-05-14 02:42:45 “His mom didnt buy butter bc they just moved so she put seasame oil in the mac and cheese! It tasted like nut! Wait, i mean nuts!” 
9356 2018-05-14 02:42:40 Mitt is ignoring that fact that Netenyahu and Trump are both under criminal investigations and will do anything to change the subject. A new war in the Middle East is just what they need. 
Putin and Saudi Arabia are happy because the price of oil will sky rocket.

9363 2018-05-14 02:41:59 BUT... At the 11 July 2013 peak: 91 was 2.269, and 2.259 today. If NZD/USD was 0.79 on 11/6/13 cf. 0.67 today & oil cost $USD72p/b today cf. $USD105.26p/b in 2013. NZ paid about $NZD127 p/b in 2013 and $NZD103.250/b today right? I don’t get it.
9364 2018-05-14 02:41:31 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one

9397 2018-05-14 02:36:58 One of the most calming things to me is sitting in bed reading about oils lmao. Every day I learn about something new. If my skin wasn’t so sensitive, I’d be trying all types of shit. Black seed oil, blue tansy, etc.
9398 2018-05-14 02:36:54 My skin just doesn’t want to cooperate. I’m breaking out like crazy  time to bring out the strong stuff. Tea tree scrub, mask, and oil being used tonight

9404 2018-05-14 02:35:34 So are they going to close down all your oil production which from memory amounts to about 25% of your countries income or is it ok to export it to others to burn?

9406 2018-05-14 02:34:42 I don’t understand why gas prices keep going up. I thought we were energy independent. We are exporting oil so wouldn’t you think we have a lot of it. This means prices should be going down
9407 2018-05-14 02:34:26 You would never be able to keep up, and I am unwilling to waste additional time on you. What I want? Weren't you the initiator of the thread Scotty and I just a troll? LOL, dude, aren't first person shooter games and a high quality Skittles flavored oil calling you?
9408 2018-05-14 02:34:12 But that's ok ... Russia benefits from higher oil prices
9409 2018-05-14 02:34:06 I used pre-made wrappers but sauteed carrot, cabbage, mushroom, ginger and garlic to fill them, then cook then in a skilled with oil & water.
9410 2018-05-14 02:34:03 That joke I made about eating a Gulf-state oil billionaire's ass was crude. But it was meant to be tongue-in-sheikh.
9411 2018-05-14 02:34:00 America violating the Iran Nuclear deal will cause oil to go even higher. Feel sorry for all those flag pulling Pick up trucks! #winning
9412 2018-05-14 02:33:33 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;
9413 2018-05-14 02:33:22 Yeah, why we just hold hands and kiss Saudis. They got all that money and all that oil and just raise oil prices. No military help
9414 2018-05-14 02:33:10 It's obvious that President Trump had a lot to do with the Chinese helping.  It seems that, when it first started, our spy planes saw oil traveling to North Korea and exposed the Chinese for it.  By keeping the pressure on them they put pressure on the NORKs.
9415 2018-05-14 02:33:04 I looooove putting a few drops of rose oil right onto my pillows before bed 
9416 2018-05-14 02:32:42 Yeah! Now Russia can fund their military buildup because you just destabilized the region and oil prices are increasing and they can sell it for more, also Iran is back to making a nuclear bomb! Your an idiot! You think it was bad, just watch what happens now! #MAGA #TrumpLies
9417 2018-05-14 02:32:41 you sound like a kid impressed by a broad making a appearance on tv and selling the usual snake oil talking points of the hedge funds:) indians have evolved from ramanujan to call centre swindlers and peddlers.
9418 2018-05-14 02:32:35 I tried to use her as shampoo about 4 times before I just gave up. It strips your hair of oil (weird, after looking at the ingredients), and leaves it feeling still somehow grimy. 3/10 would not bang.

9426 2018-05-14 02:31:31 Russian oil is also dirtier. University of Victoria published similar results about 10 years ago.
9427 2018-05-14 02:31:22 can’t fight that oil chart
9428 2018-05-14 02:31:14 The economy did not go down because of oil
9429 2018-05-14 02:31:12 It’s convenient how you’ve set up everything to be “agree with liberal foreign policy or you must just care about oil and nothing else”. No one can ever disagree with you without wanting oil prices to go up can they?

9431 2018-05-14 02:31:05 Oh yeah, I usually just spoon the gills out. 

After that, standard seasoning would be salt, olive oil, maybe some pepper. I have a Mediterranean spice mix I usually throw on them.

As for cooking, I prefer the grill.
9432 2018-05-14 02:31:05 G and here I just thought it was so they could hide all the bribes they take in Arab oil dollars
9433 2018-05-14 02:31:01 Oil will help. I’ve read that the hemp seed oil is good for sealing moisture in skin and actually fights rashes, too! So it might work 
9434 2018-05-14 02:31:01 Really want an essential oil diffuser 
9435 2018-05-14 02:31:00 Stop stealing other peoples oil probably
9436 2018-05-14 02:30:47 Rubbing on coconut oil after a bath is just A1
9437 2018-05-14 02:30:40 E100 is not a legal fuel and never has been.  As for subsidy’s, The blenders credit ended in 2010 which went to the blender (mostly oil companies) The RFS is designed to break the monopoly and allow competition.  It’s working.

9444 2018-05-14 02:29:15 Is that a fact? Your country needs the international community as much as it needs you. Isolation never ends well. Pulling out of deals negotiated over years because of made up bullshit serves nobody. But hey, at least the price of oil went up and Iran can have nukes again. Yay.

9454 2018-05-14 02:27:54 No this definitely hurt Russia a lot. It drive up oil price which mean small number of really rich Russian get lot of money and really poor Russian cannot afford to drive their car. No country would ever do such a thing to its people. Chex mix, liberals.

9465 2018-05-14 02:26:14 ||: Squeaky wheels get the oil and all that.
9466 2018-05-14 02:25:45 How ignorant you are. Venezuela became a petrostate. 50% of GDP and 95% of exports. Bottom falls out of intnl oil market, economy collapses. Canada: only 9% of GDP, 13% of exports. Who wanted to make us more like Venezuela? Harper.
9467 2018-05-14 02:25:45 Oil companies could put a stop to this if they wanted to.

9472 2018-05-14 02:24:55 Gas prices are already rising. Russia loves it because they're a major oil producer. We will be bailing out their economy.

9484 2018-05-14 02:22:05 Take a previously successful capitalist country to socialism;  whereby you run your biggest money maker (oil) into the ground, rob the country, and rob the creditors, you end up with no oil, no people and no credit.
9485 2018-05-14 02:21:50 Well cucumber juice is anti-aging (and deeply moisturizing), so that might help. Aloe Vera juice (aloe vera gel from the plant blended with water) + rose water (Roses boiled in water) are also anti-aging/moisturizing as well. 

Sweet Almond oil, Avocado oil, & jojoba oil are
9486 2018-05-14 02:21:46 Thank God we have trillionaire oil companies to protect us from those greedy climate scientists.
9487 2018-05-14 02:21:45 Russia's only real export is energy. Low oil prices have been killing them. They desperately need the price to go up. And the US pulling out of the Iran deal will have the exact result. Putin gets what he wants, and puts US even further offside with its European allies. #basta

いいお天気ですね今週あたりか５月ですがもう初夏気温がまた急上昇のようです、暑さ対策と紫外線対策、お肌だけでなく髪の毛さんのケアお忘れなく(`・ω・´;) 
9530 2018-05-14 02:15:36 I think so yes. I also started using bio oil which without stabbing my face I have had success. The derma roller I notice for reducing my scars and on other ppl I can tell when they've used recently.bBut more involved to do it.
9531 2018-05-14 02:15:22 How about helping the oil industry which in turn helps all of Canada. What leader in their mind sits on the 3rd highest oil reserve in the world.  ????
9532 2018-05-14 02:15:14 Oil is around $70. I don’t see it going up much anymore. Oil price of $60 is sufficient enough to keep everyone happy. Now only if oil stocks can also increase as much as oil has.
9533 2018-05-14 02:15:12 Wash your hair several times after the coconut oil though because it’s very hard to get out and your hair will look so greasy if you don’t get everything out! 
9534 2018-05-14 02:15:07 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
9535 2018-05-14 02:14:59 I get money like I’m oil affiliated.
9536 2018-05-14 02:14:57 Can’t get dispersed well enough. I think their tongue grooming them helps push the oil along? I’m not sure the science behind it, but his vet said shaving them often helps long term. Might be something worth discussing with your vet.
9537 2018-05-14 02:14:52 I’ve had awful migraines for 3 days and what finally helped with lavender oil and peppermint oil nature is cool sometimes

9552 2018-05-14 02:13:04 You think it happens overnight? Industry always looks for the faster - cheaper way. Less control on poisons, dumping sludge, opening fed parks for oil and gas drilling. Open your eyes it will happen

9560 2018-05-14 02:11:31 A reasonable person who ask why a country w so much oil needs nuclear power. Hmmm
9561 2018-05-14 02:11:30 Interestingly take. It remains to be seen how prophetic you are. You are already right about the rise in oil prices - I'm hearing they could be heading higher still.

9566 2018-05-14 02:10:38 I feel very happy. My mom liked my gift and I had amazing food. Portobello mushrooms grilled with balsamic vinaigrette, chicken grilled with italian dressing, tomato/olive oil/feta asparagus, salad with "western" dressing, and some cookies and cream cupcakes <3
9567 2018-05-14 02:10:38 Sorry but you're looking at this wrong. Since the tax cuts do not have any effect on oil prices, if not for those tax breaks Americans would be paying for their gas from their prior disposable income. They'd be poorer.

9578 2018-05-14 02:09:47 No,not  the ABC And our oil reserves are good but 6 years ago America stopped buying our oil so our country is now in a depression ..
9579 2018-05-14 02:09:18 Best guess? Oil company business and how to get that ownership % to Trump & co under the radar...the deal Christopher Steele referenced in the dossier, and that was transferred to Qatar that month! #TrumpRICO #TrumpRussia
9580 2018-05-14 02:09:15 As I learn Korean language, there are times when I know how to say words like transcendence, artificial intelligence, satellites but i dont know how to say oil! hahaha
9581 2018-05-14 02:09:11 But we do. When the price of our fuel doubles because of the shift in world oil supply inflation rises. All of our goods are shipped using fuel. This is deja vu. America wants a war in the Middle East, American oil companies make Bank. We suffer. This is how we cause recessions.

9584 2018-05-14 02:09:01 legit all I did was freeze, then thaw to get rid of the silky texture. Use garlic & onion powder, S&P. cook on low heat to draw out extra moisture, then cook on high heat w/ oil to crisp up.

It was dope for my 1st try
9585 2018-05-14 02:08:59 Can't figure this out.  We are self sufficient in oil and gas production.  We in fact export oil.  Now we are told because of the US sanctions against Iran, oil prices will rise.  How does Iran effect the US in this case?
9586 2018-05-14 02:08:54 You should try using vitamin E oil!! It helps a lot tbh. I use it for my acne scars and it works miracles.
9587 2018-05-14 02:08:34 How about also making doctors accept insurance.  Making insurance companies cover this that for people in #chronicpain arent luxuries, like hot tubs, cbd oil, massage chairs, cannibas in states where its legal and I could go on and on...
9588 2018-05-14 02:08:28 And droppied the Iran deal to make Oil more of a commodity.

9694 2018-05-14 01:48:12 Oil Producers and Distributors manipulating the market. OPEC controls supply that is : how much released to the Market at any given time. No such thing as a free Market.
9695 2018-05-14 01:48:05 Expect 10 yr treasury yield fall below 2.93% 
Cauitious, rising price of crude oil price. 
Bearish gold ..

Bullish stock market..no doubt expect shall happen.
9696 2018-05-14 01:47:52 Your side won't win until you acknowledge your greed.  Be greedy for solar, like the oil companies.
9697 2018-05-14 01:47:49 idk hot oil burns all over my arms i guess
9698 2018-05-14 01:47:44 It’s called research. NK imports it’s oil from China and others. Why, if you have it under your own ground? As well it is not listed among the 98 countries that produce it. Education erodes bias based on ignorance.
9699 2018-05-14 01:47:36 This bitch said she put oil sheen on her pussy hair 
9700 2018-05-14 01:47:33 olive oil carrot juice and coconut oil sis never forget
9701 2018-05-14 01:47:24 ranted for a bit this weekend after filling my tank!!! talk about sticker shock!! Who knew russian oil cost so damned much, or Iranian oil was so cheap!!
9702 2018-05-14 01:47:15 sure it will, you just gotta hastag and tag every channel on twitch as well, that will bring some extra spice to the bots as well, really oil the machine, ya know?
9703 2018-05-14 01:47:00 Your supposed to oil your scalp
9704 2018-05-14 01:46:59 any soap product w/ coconut oil + tile floors = death trap
9705 2018-05-14 01:46:38 Seeing stuff like this I miss the bike but I spent a couple years only getting it out on the day I changed the oil and decided I'd sell until kids were older..
9706 2018-05-14 01:46:11 มันเลือกไม่ได้ หนงเป็นทุกสถานะ
9707 2018-05-14 01:46:09 Friend in Steilacoom counted 106 oil train cars came through today
9708 2018-05-14 01:45:48 Mike Pence, the oleaginous snake oil salesman.

9710 2018-05-14 01:45:29 You deleted your tweet because you looked like an idiot but it was too late. Next you’re going to say something about Arabs and oil money next? Go back to crying about Wenger
9711 2018-05-14 01:45:14 Aww ty <3 This lipstick stays put too :) real trooper, nearly survived oil dip and bread after a long day of theme park wear and tear.
9712 2018-05-14 01:45:02 I love baby oil i be glistening
9713 2018-05-14 01:45:00 “we work in the oil field, we spend all our beer on money”
9714 2018-05-14 01:44:56 What a coincidence, I just restarted oil painting afyer years of cartooning.
9715 2018-05-14 01:44:41 Putting baby oil on her cheeks so you  see the wave in HD >
9716 2018-05-14 01:44:39 Wyatt out here looking like an oil tycoon #Timeless
9717 2018-05-14 01:44:32 Today at work someone asked if canola oil was a dairy product. This is the same person who thought her car was broke when she accidentally shifted into neutral on the highway and who thought that ministers were people who rang giant bells... this right here is why I love my job
9718 2018-05-14 01:44:30 Add a few drops of Eucalyptus Oil
in the bowl and no one
will know what you've done. ;)
9719 2018-05-14 01:44:26 Good news for oil producing states.
9720 2018-05-14 01:44:26 @smartertrader if you believe oil has limited future such as I do, are there any alt energy spec plays you believe in?
9721 2018-05-14 01:44:24 Trump is a good snake oil salesman. He’ll tell you what you want to hear, with the helps of his minions brainstorming, what will makes you vote for him. You know like his show Apprentice

9723 2018-05-14 01:43:51 Just eat a meat, vegetables cooked in coconut oil, and a avocado. 

I eat that for basically every meal and I’m good to go. 

I have no appetite now, so I only eat between 12pm and 8pm. I eat 2 meals.
9724 2018-05-14 01:43:43 Now Playing Wojtek The Bear - Oil & Water #wojtekthebear
9725 2018-05-14 01:43:37 Give me a day or 2. Changing oil on both cars right now
9726 2018-05-14 01:43:36 fresh extra sharp cheddar cheese + olive oil/sea salt crackers = basically heaven on earth
9727 2018-05-14 01:43:28 LMAO JASON IS HOLDING COOKING OIL
9728 2018-05-14 01:42:58 Motor oil, masking as a drink.
9729 2018-05-14 01:42:53 Yep. Whadda you think about Comrade Bone Spurs now?! He's leaking oil bad now....
9730 2018-05-14 01:42:39 Lavender oil is so nice like without it I'd be dead from chronic sleep deprivation but it just doesn't work anymore
9731 2018-05-14 01:42:21 the spoon was for mixing in the oil at the end!!!
9732 2018-05-14 01:42:09 LMFAOOO CHILL
9733 2018-05-14 01:42:08 People try to make it out to be too difficult. Here’s bottom line what it is: 

Eat a meat, eat vegetables cooked in coconut oil, and eat an avocado. 

If you eat that for every meal, it’s keto.
9734 2018-05-14 01:41:37 I use Vaseline or coconut oil
9735 2018-05-14 01:41:18 Have any of y'all ever took CBD oil pills before and do they really work?
9736 2018-05-14 01:41:12 You can't really believe that there's not other athletes have given the time and opportunity would succeed best basketball players ever never made the NBA they only played on the playground. You're buying into player hype
9737 2018-05-14 01:40:52 Dang them petroleum engineers really makin that guap trynna extract oil
9738 2018-05-14 01:40:50 having a boyfriend who works in the oil field is so hard. i miss him so much & he’s literally only been gone 8 hours. 
9739 2018-05-14 01:40:46 On May 9, 2011 gasoline averaged $3.96 per gallon nationwide.  Who was President? Today the average is $3.13 per gallon.  Who is President?  Did Obama’s oil buddies make out big?
9740 2018-05-14 01:40:42 Futures firm Sunday night withTrump trying to make nice with ZTE and China, a lot of bullish commentary on energy ($100 oil I read a lot this weekend), and we are still bouncing post earnings.   I am watching for any signs of a reversal before we hit the old highs $QQQ $DJIA $SPX
9741 2018-05-14 01:40:40 It’s crazy that eucalyptus essential oil opens up my chest faster than my inhaler
9742 2018-05-14 01:40:31 Well your trying to steal oil Dumbnuts
9743 2018-05-14 01:40:26 Use cold water to rinse off remaining hairs after trimming. Thereafter apply 1 or 2 drops of baby oil 
(Aloe & Vitamin  E)
9744 2018-05-14 01:40:18 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
9745 2018-05-14 01:40:16 My dad: do you want an essential oil diffuser for $6?
My mom: is it free?

.....Happy Mother’s Day!
9746 2018-05-14 01:39:57 huge difference between being a prepper in case the fucking oil economy collapses and selling all your possessions (or starting world war 3) because something something Jesus.
9747 2018-05-14 01:39:50 When will people realize the Bush Crime Family's connections to
John Hinckley Jr.  
Iran Contra 
CIA War on Drugs

Mena airport 
JFK assassination
911 Attack
Bin Ladin family oil/business
9748 2018-05-14 01:39:48 All you had to do was ask a New Yorker about Trump. We’ve had to put up with his mendacity and self-aggrandizement for decades. He’s a snake oil salesman and the country got Trumped.
9749 2018-05-14 01:39:41 I would recommend you stick with it for at least 3 weeks. The 1st week you wont feel too great, your body is basically going through sugar withdrawals. Get some macadamia nuts and MCT oil will save you lol.
9750 2018-05-14 01:39:15 Right, you just made it worse AND boosted the price of Gas for both "#WeThePeople" and the Oil Companies, #SoMuchWinning 
9751 2018-05-14 01:38:53 Who gives a shit what Trump said 6 years ago? Would you like me to show you what your politician of choice said 6 years ago? Go take another hit of your oil dude.
9752 2018-05-14 01:38:53 Someone else’s relationship is none of my business. 

Continue to drink your water, lather your edges with coconut oil, and mind yours
9753 2018-05-14 01:38:49 Look at Opec, every time someone, Gadaffi/Sadam, tried to move away from selling oil on the dollar they became a threat and were eliminated. What the Saudi's did was cooperate while advancing their own goals, hence a desert is now the capital of wealth.
9754 2018-05-14 01:38:45 Because Iraq is barely stable & it besides oil loss would not be huge blow to nation state. Syria is a failed state while Turkey and Iran are both very established and would be huge blow to two relatively large economies.
9755 2018-05-14 01:38:26 It shouldn't.But the oil companies will use it as an excuse to raise prices.
9756 2018-05-14 01:38:26 Yep, if we don't take action by 2020, the climate will. We can watch upper ocean temperature this year and next, read about hurricane damage and cross our fingers, or get stuck in to shutting down the oil sands, pipelines and LNG terminals.
9757 2018-05-14 01:38:18 i believe it went up 5 cents during yesterday. that's them there oil companies holding the country to ransom. imho.
9758 2018-05-14 01:38:15 there’s a teenager I know (not naming names) that doesn’t know how to check the oil in car let alone change a tire or drive bc mommy babies the shit out of him & daddy is no handy man either.
9759 2018-05-14 01:38:05 Dean Heller & POTUS missed last week
Hawaii has 17 fissures actively flowing lava
North Korea blew up nuclear test facility three times last year
Oil $70/barrel
Gasoline 3.00/gallon
LaDavid Johnson remains sent home on different aircraft
Obama met remains of fallen military
9760 2018-05-14 01:37:50 Please tell me they came to Phoenix and found oil!!
9761 2018-05-14 01:37:36 Sonuvabitch used olive oil..... O__O
9762 2018-05-14 01:37:31 Muito difícil colocar um label nas coisas. Dizem q mglu foi turnaround. Discordo. Foi mistura de sorte c/ pitada de short squeeze. E Petr e Vale? Tem contribuição dos movos mgmts, mas o principal são oil e iron ore. As pessoas gostam de dar nomes. Nós só queremos ativos baratos.
9763 2018-05-14 01:37:26 Lol! You idiots. Russia & China will never go along with more sanctions.  France, Germany, may not even implement sanctions.  

You twits blew it.

And we all get higher oil prices.

Own-goal of the century by FDD!
9764 2018-05-14 01:37:12 There are parts of Texas with grandfathered air and water quality standards for refineries.  Grandfathered out of the EPA restrictions over and over until they clean other countries' crude oil there and dump the toxins into the ocean.
9765 2018-05-14 01:37:07 Their moves to exit dollar denominated trade in oil and to develop an alternative to SWIFT have been going on for several years. Wake up West.
9766 2018-05-14 01:36:46 just got the CN oil train video uploaded
9767 2018-05-14 01:36:36 Somebody doesn't understand the concept of constitutional carry.
9768 2018-05-14 01:36:31 They don't - there is so much oil and nat gas there that the world would choke itself to death before they could use it all up - can't you just see the nuclear power plants and imagine the bullseye they would be
9769 2018-05-14 01:36:05 #Macrisis   Todos creen que Macri y Su Banda van por @C5N...nono..solo les interesa #Oil destilerias y el Puerto que Tiene en #Rosario
9770 2018-05-14 01:35:30 They probably put cannabis oil in it lmao
9771 2018-05-14 01:35:27 Not oil but a mixture of meat, veggies and sauce. It only hurt a little bit.
9772 2018-05-14 01:35:05 Haha.. if they cannot handle the oil... Lets ged rid of all the oil dont you think? So the solar panels again are a good idea..;-)
9773 2018-05-14 01:35:05 Pork loin, oven-roasted over a bed of classic mirepoix, with garlic, rosemary, salt & pepper.  Green beans boiled then sautéed in leftover bacon fat, and sautéed wild shiitake mushrooms in olive oil.  Paired with a nice white wine and I'm food coma'd by 9pm, tops.
9774 2018-05-14 01:35:01 Oil those babies up n toss em on the grill!! As for the ground...I'm thinking some tasty tacos or ooooooo, maybe enchiladas?
9775 2018-05-14 01:34:53 Looks like there was a type of oil on it before you painted.
9776 2018-05-14 01:34:31 I've started making pork "ramen" in the slow cooker. 1 pork shoulder, onion, shallots, wild mushrooms, garlic, ginger, chili oil, soy sauce, fish sauce, chicken stock. 6-8 hours on low.

9780 2018-05-14 01:33:02 That’s just about how much oil we have left in the world...perfect!
9781 2018-05-14 01:32:57 Find a place where you can run (towards an exit) and leave cooking oil in a place you can avoid in that path
9782 2018-05-14 01:32:34 From same link, Americans spill 17 million gallons of fuel each year while filling up lawn care equipment. That’s more than the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989.
9783 2018-05-14 01:32:13 Oil

9789 2018-05-14 01:29:38 I hate the smell of coconut oil being cooked
9790 2018-05-14 01:29:33 The smoke point on coconut oil is very low. Do it in 10 second spurts instead. Or 5 seconds.
9791 2018-05-14 01:29:17 はあ？？？？いきたい
9792 2018-05-14 01:28:57 1. ... After?
2. Industry and commercial buildings.
3. Yes, but is it worse or better than GHGs released from oil? Also, burning things better used for plastic has an opp cost too.
4. See thread, storage still needs to come down. But, distributed and diversified sources are key.

9796 2018-05-14 01:28:20 in his adult years, whenever they'll be. Oh, The Cannabis Oil will help sooth his sore gums? Might be a good idea to apply some when its time to brush his teeth.
9797 2018-05-14 01:28:20 Mum: put thid lavander oil on this handkerchief and see if helps you sleep tonight. 
Me: okay.

Holy shit
9798 2018-05-14 01:27:56 I don’t remember a lot from year 11 chemistry but I do remember OIL RIG. Oxidation is loss of an electron, reduction is gaining one. Not sure about actual oxygen though.
9799 2018-05-14 01:27:49 And Trump always said "we should have gotten the oil". He was obsessed that we didn't get the oil.

9810 2018-05-14 01:25:12 I had a bunch of the packets today lots of energy and I might be sweating small amounts of oil also.
9811 2018-05-14 01:25:03 Massage coconut oil into your hair once a week and let it sit for 20 minutes, then wash like normal or taking B vitamins should help too. Either one should do the trick!
9812 2018-05-14 01:24:56 I want to know why my dumbass scheduled an oil appointment for 8am in Terre Haute on a Monday 
9813 2018-05-14 01:24:48 And really there is alot of natural gas and oil in new jersey. I mean i know there are lot of landfills. So lots of methane but thought all the heating oil you use is from north Dakota and texas
9814 2018-05-14 01:24:07 Once we were told energy independence wud keep price @ pump level. Now know it was a lie. We r exporting to highest worldwide bidder. US consumer suffers. Big Oil/Gas get richer. Tax exports or afford US consumers price break.

9817 2018-05-14 01:23:36 “Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.”
2 Kings 4:7 KJVhttp://bible.com/1/2ki.4.7.kjv
9818 2018-05-14 01:23:30 frozen vegetables roasted on a sheet pan with a little olive oil/spices is super low mess and low effort, plus you can stock up on frozen veggies without worrying about them going bad! you don’t even have to defrost either, just bake at 450 for 10-15 min
9819 2018-05-14 01:23:29 Israel; and we hid snares of Ephraim, Oshea the way by judgment seat, with oil.
9820 2018-05-14 01:22:34 I always double boiler oils on the oven - pan of water, then the oils in a Pyrex bowl. You can geat the water in the microwave and do the same thing. Coconut oil goes liquid at 76 F, so that will be plenty of heat.
9821 2018-05-14 01:22:23 Stop Lying Dipshit Donny Trump! You scrapped the Iran deal to help big oil and the Russian economy, and because it was Obama’s deal. Meanwhile Americans pay more at the pump and more for groceries. How many workers are going to be laid off at Boeing because of your stupidity?
9822 2018-05-14 01:22:14 And...
You are aware of the Billions the energy sector has been receiving from Govts for Decades right
Oil & Gas specifically have been sudsidized by Feds & Prov's still are in fact. Direct funding, grants, Subsidies & Tax breaks worth Billions paid for vy & with Taxpayers $$
9823 2018-05-14 01:22:11 Apparently, a chemical compound resulting from the reaction of an alkali (like sodium or potassium hydroxide) with a fatty acid. Made from animal fat or vegetable oil.

Still don't know. 
9824 2018-05-14 01:22:11 been letting it go, no beard oil tho what did you use
9825 2018-05-14 01:22:03 Pulling out of Paris accord and lowering fuel efficiency standards also coincidentally will help preserve demand for oil.
9826 2018-05-14 01:21:45 Where all addicts, and we are addicted to oil,almost everything we make is made with oil
9827 2018-05-14 01:21:28 Well John
If you and best pal

For favors to win Presidency 
Wouldn't you try turn GOP against FBI DOJ
9828 2018-05-14 01:21:09 sad. the weed has been lost on our journey, from the vehicle to the front door. But I found the oil. At least there's that.
9829 2018-05-14 01:21:08 That mandate protects the oil industry not the E market. The oil industry is fully embedded in government and uses that influence to protect its wealth. Capitalism needs strong government to protect their monopolies & wealth. Its the only logical out come.
9830 2018-05-14 01:21:02 33:11 The LORD came viot out threescore things and according to the altar of Ammon: and God said, Ariser, O God men, and he that hath a witness happeted you, that thou comest these things to cover so from such oil.
9831 2018-05-14 01:20:50 Wow. There is nothing called big or small mistakes. It's about intentions. Practice what you preach. For political gain not changing oil price is unethical.earlier govt did these mistakes and jumla party continuing
9832 2018-05-14 01:20:49 Who cares about corporate losers how about the citizens of USA why don’t you go to the table with the saudis and turn oil faucet on so we don’t go back to 5 dollars a gallon

9834 2018-05-14 01:20:28 Si soy un bruto. La verdad voy a leer mas sobre eso de teletransportacion de oil y de que las ultilidades futuras en un negocio no se pueden demandar en Corte si te roban el contrato. Gracias. Aprendi mucho hoy
9835 2018-05-14 01:20:22 Russia told you to pull out of the Iran deal because they benefit from the higher oil prices.  You sre trying to fool Americans into believing it's because of Iran.  No, it's because the Russian banks ordered you to do it.
9836 2018-05-14 01:20:22 And let those honest, altruistic guys who head up banks, ins co’s, oil co’s & the like, who wud kill their brother for an extra dollar, just govern themselves, huh? Collude? Set pricing? Jonathan, often you show just how much u don’t know or understand.

9857 2018-05-14 01:17:40 i was gonna charge less but her fiancé is an oil field man and her kids are bad as hell. i had to get my coins
9858 2018-05-14 01:17:25 I had the savings part of step 3 down, but then things fell apart. Was doing some guestimate math last night. At $3 a gallon fuel costs me about 7 cents a mile plus oil changes and such.
9859 2018-05-14 01:17:04 It's a population tiny country of 5 million. Obviously they aren't letting in big numbers.
Also it's a historically poor country that didn't become wealthy until oil was discovered in the 1960s. Before that, fishing was one of Norway's primary ways of making a living.
9860 2018-05-14 01:17:01 So, no, the reason why I feel oil and gas development, pipelines, etc, are good is specifically to allow your communities to achieve a level of independence by negotiating good deals, seeing financial benefits. I want you to be 100% independent of the Feds.
9861 2018-05-14 01:16:14 I put olive oil on mine, never really had any issues. I don’t put them directly over the coals though..
9862 2018-05-14 01:16:11 It blackened the little screen thing inside the oven. I figured the oil vaporized and became combustible. Aired it out and tried running it a few seconds with nothing in there and ZAP flashed again. Did that a nniversary out 3 times. Thought I killed it. But nope. Still works.
9863 2018-05-14 01:16:04 A lot of guys posting up in the “reds” till they fail the cdl test and get let go. then go cold on social media no more post about “oil field baby!” Or “dirty hands clean money”  bum asses

9898 2018-05-14 01:10:09 I think I discovered tonight that it is a bad idea to liquify coconut oil in the microwave. I put a blob in a casserole dish and hit it for 35 seconds. The oven lit up like a spotlight.
9899 2018-05-14 01:10:08 They have different kinds at stores too, the distilled ones. They are the same, they are just only able to be used externally and for diffusions on oil burners
9900 2018-05-14 01:09:39 Even better and will save more lives in the long run is that you announce a study and R&D program to phase out the use of Palm Oil in your products within ten years and a zero tolerance to single use plastic. You could lead this.

9908 2018-05-14 01:08:40 Lemme get this straight: this is all due to a vast cabal of scientists plotting to get the global community to reduce carbon emissions (and stop the reliance on fossil fuels) and were it not for a plucky band of oil lobbyists we'd all fall for it.

9939 2018-05-14 01:03:56 They are problematic: Ask China and India, where the pollution is so thick one rarely sees a blue sky. As far as a solution, maybe the oil industry can unpack some of the solar patents they secreted away to keep the competition from being viable.

9967 2018-05-14 01:00:07 Seriously? I think we should go totally with renewable, clean energy. Oil should be the last option, not the first.

9969 2018-05-14 00:59:35 All kinds. I love Indian food prepared in mustard oil. I love Japanese karashi. I love sweet German mustard. All mustard is good.
9970 2018-05-14 00:59:31 And if Russian sanctions are lifted they can crack into that sweet Arctic oil...
9971 2018-05-14 00:59:18 The price of oil rises & falls for a bunch of reasons. Always has. I make my living from it.
We have oil. We are just fine.
Let the man work.
You are aware Iran never signed that agreement, right?
It never was binding. Check with the state department.
9972 2018-05-14 00:59:12 Cristóbal Lopez compró Oil Combustibles gracias a los millones de pesos de retenciones que cobró y no ingresó al fisco...pero eso te parece bárbaro @robdnavarro no? #CinismoK 
9973 2018-05-14 00:58:58 Coconut oil is the best trust me I use it for those exact reasons!!
9974 2018-05-14 00:58:53 Ok, this is real simple. You have 1 liter of silicon oil in a perfect dewar. You heat it to 250 C.  Now you open a small hole so 1 J/sec leaks out.  How much heating do you need so the temperature stays at 250 C? Oil heat capacity =100 J/liter. What's the heat content of the oil
9975 2018-05-14 00:58:46 So what? Your accusation is that trump is leaving the Iran deal to help the Russians. That is is baseless and a slander. Conservatives oppose the Iran deal based on principle not oil
9976 2018-05-14 00:58:27 The problem is the voters always fall for the “I will vote that way next time” it’s just bs
9977 2018-05-14 00:58:24 山下清っていうんだ、
おにぎり好きそう
9978 2018-05-14 00:58:20 And remember who chose Rex Tillerson as Sec of State. Putin did. T-Rex just happens to be the guy who negotiated the $500 Billion oil deal with Russia. Yes, the same deal that Obama's sanctions stopped from going through
9979 2018-05-14 00:58:06 Yeah I use the shea moisture rose oil one !
9980 2018-05-14 00:57:41 Tea tree oil is working wonders on my keloid acne. Fuck that White doctor who just bleed the system for over a year
9981 2018-05-14 00:57:39 Rincan US. Privacy-aware oil with hierarchical sputum. Comput Mech. 1980;2:787-827.

9984 2018-05-14 00:57:30 Because stupid people a) conflate weather with climate, and b) cherry pick data to support their whacky, oil and gas funded ideas.

But wait... big oil and gas **does** accept climate change and **supports** CO2 pricing.
9985 2018-05-14 00:57:29 Thanks @BarackObama. Oil may hit $100/barrel in 2019!  Without the middle man buying it no revenue will be produced. Ppl if that happens please consider NOT driving unless necessary!  We must stick together. Trump said long ago. (Iran) take the Oil and go!
9986 2018-05-14 00:57:25 So does Saudi Arabia but we are friends with them because they sell us oil. Fact
9987 2018-05-14 00:56:46 of course. deli style for hot dogs & sandwiches; dijon for oil & vinegar dressing & egg salad; with added horseradish just in case you want to go nuts with yr condiments.
9988 2018-05-14 00:56:39 I don’t recall any automaker taking a revolutionary step towards reducing dependence on oil in the 80’s, which was ultimately what will Be their undoing.  The 80’s warned them, they ignored the warning.
9989 2018-05-14 00:56:34 @Citron_oil フォロー返しありがとうございますー！とても可愛らしいイラストですね！
9990 2018-05-14 00:56:08 I use coconut oil in some of mine
9991 2018-05-14 00:55:42 Sprinkle of mince garlic, oil of choice, salt pepper and a sprinkle of oregano. Roast until golden brown.
9992 2018-05-14 00:55:13 Hahaha if the EU did see it the way you did then why didn't the go with you? 
Perhaps it would be in their interest to build a Oil pipeline from Iran into Europe, block the straight of Hormuz so no ships can trade oil to US.
9993 2018-05-14 00:55:12 Try coconut oil it always helps mine
9994 2018-05-14 00:54:50 Thank you for your tweet. The oil used is in fact rapeseed oil. Feel free to email us if you have any questions. We hope you enjoyed the cookies   have a safe flight! 
9995 2018-05-14 00:54:47 @nailogical Cristine, do you know if reusable nail oil pens exist? I hate having to throw them out when I’m done with them - plus I’m a poor student, so if I can reuse them and save some money that would be great lol
9996 2018-05-14 00:54:39 I saw this tweet that said “kehlani looks like she squirts engine oil” and i really cant stop thinking about it
9997 2018-05-14 00:54:28 Ang tita ko na natutuwa ako kapag binibilhan ako ng vics at efficascent oil hmmm
9998 2018-05-14 00:54:24 Hey @JustinTrudeau Hempworx CBD oil has been helping thousands of Canadians but have yet to receive there approval back from health Canada! What’s the hold up?! So many people are going to go without! #breakthestigma
9999 2018-05-14 00:54:20 For a thicker one try olive oil, castor or wild growth oil. For a lighter one jojoba oil these the only ones I use and they work perfect with my hair bc my hair can’t keep moisture literally at all. Occasionally I use vitamin E and neem oil
10000 2018-05-14 00:54:17 Never mix oil & blood.
10001 2018-05-14 00:54:06 That's awesome. Defeat despots everywhere- ditch oil
