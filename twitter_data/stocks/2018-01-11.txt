41 2018-01-11 23:47:18 Fuck buying Bitcoin or stocks and shares - a warehouse full of Irn-Bru will be worth about 600% more in a year's time. Guaranteed earner
42 2018-01-11 23:46:40 @SmartyPig Invest at least $10 in ETFs and other individual stocks and bonds on a weekly basis #SmartyTips #Sweepstakes
43 2018-01-11 23:46:40 #BBCQT only the state can enact censorship through regulation and enforcement. Any individual or private entity has the right to choose what it stocks or sells or makes available within the law. Virgin simply made a choice. You can buy the DM in plenty other places
44 2018-01-11 23:46:21 It means for every 1 share of $GBTC someone holds, they will receive 90 more. 

Basically companies/stocks do this once the price is "too high" this will lower the ticker price "not affecting the market cap" but give the perceived notion that something is more affordable
45 2018-01-11 23:45:54 I think they have increased their overall demand for stocks which has come from a reduced demand for bonds, mainly through postponing or eliminating rebalancing. Thats my best guess.
46 2018-01-11 23:45:42 Why are bump stocks still legal?
47 2018-01-11 23:44:28 Got it. The big issue for tech industry is poorly informed investors spouting investment theses for companies that are totally flawed and cast a negative light on the entire industry. But if one wants to play casino with stocks, I don’t fundamentally have an issue with that.
48 2018-01-11 23:44:23 The great rotation is a description that was used to describe investors shifting from bonds to stocks which could push valuations of stocks higher and would put a potential floor on interest rates, no?
49 2018-01-11 23:44:19 Don't let stocks run low in future.
50 2018-01-11 23:44:17 I believe that all "kits" or "mods" that make a legal gun illegal should be outlawed (including bump stocks).  I also want to see gun safes be made more affordable, through tax deductions or federal grant application, in addition to this (and as an educator) I believe that all .
51 2018-01-11 23:43:38 DM stocks making all time high except eurozone
52 2018-01-11 23:43:24 My first tweet in this thread “It may not be due to sales of bonds for equities, but households are pretty darn overweight stocks vs history”
53 2018-01-11 23:42:51 And still not a damn thing has been done abt bump stocks. Too soon? Or were you hoping we’d forget in the chaos of your parties ineptitude?
54 2018-01-11 23:42:35 @jimcramer not only is higher oil not hurting airline stocks, it is not having nearly the effect it should be on energy stocks. It seems crazy that oil can make this run and yet the sector barely moves... people will come around eventually
55 2018-01-11 23:42:34 A brilliant businessman who’s had dozens of failed businesses, multiple bankruptcies, and would be worth more money today if he’d simply invested his inheritance in stocks and bonds. That’s some brilliance.

59 2018-01-11 23:42:06 My mood flips quicker than Bitcoin stocks
60 2018-01-11 23:41:49 Before I came to play $DAX, or to comment on BITCOIN recently, 5 years I have been forecasting 18 indices and stocks, 

A forecast is not personal and millions can see it in the various blogs, funny some people try to answer them?

I make it a point not to trade in USA, no sides!
61 2018-01-11 23:41:44 One of my stocks doubled two days ago. There are opportunities too. Biotechs can move much, for example, although it can be treacherous to trade them.
62 2018-01-11 23:40:52 You’re so awesome
63 2018-01-11 23:40:11 I think he is referring to stocks. Being a new console with the opposition already out there this would be the case as far as stocks goes. But him not saying they won the NPD(is that what it's called?) Probably means they didn't. Or else he would be bragging about it.
64 2018-01-11 23:39:57 Just reading about South Korean raid into offices and taking all data related to crypto coin exchange. Why they can’t agree about taxing crypto because all this crypto coin exchange stocks and webs are run by private people not state government
65 2018-01-11 23:38:59 One question and I’ll drop it...

Scenario A: you own $100 in stocks and they give you a $10 dividend, leaving you $90, and you buy back stock with that $10, leaving you with $100
Scenario B: you own $100 in stocks and there is no distribution

Is your demand different in A vs B?
66 2018-01-11 23:37:55 $1 in US large value stocks in March ‘09 is worth over $5 today.  That’s a pretty good reason to stay the course...

77 2018-01-11 23:27:59 I made 100k this year through stocks. I don't like to brag but for a person who went through struggle, pain, and losing a lot of relatives, this isn't bad for being 27 years old. Pain is success.

131 2018-01-11 22:55:18 HOUSING Should never be controlled "Investnents" like stocks or bonds.
132 2018-01-11 22:54:43 Any pointers on where and how to buy such stocks? I’m keen on getting into it. Thanks!
133 2018-01-11 22:54:38 Thanks for nothing @SpeakerRyan

We haven’t forgotten your #GOPTaxScam

Go support @IronStache to get rid of this rich-loving shill, Speaker!
Also, he is letting this unfit @POTUS drag this great country to the ground.

But if the plan was for the corporate tax breaks to give the wealthy more money, then yes, it is a good thing.

141 2018-01-11 22:52:43 You're assuming employees are invested in a 401K (stocks). People where I work make $15 an hour and most can't afford to even donate to a 401K. Plus the fact, if waste management can afford it now, they could have the whole time, this is a scam.

147 2018-01-11 22:48:20 That's true about MJ cooling could force investors to look at other stocks, such as $IDK. It's always good to hold a diversified portfolio anyways. Imagine if someone was 100% invested in MJ and then something happened to that sector.

158 2018-01-11 22:42:48 It perplexes me that among those who accuse the Fed (rightfully so) of inflating asset bubbles, very few are fully invested in stocks and bonds. If you believe what you espouse, why not take advantage of the free ride?

161 2018-01-11 22:41:01 Its quite an interesting topic. As time goes by, it May become more risky to invest in conventional stocks rather than crypto, as crypto becoming main stream.

177 2018-01-11 22:34:52 I'm tired of Trump supporters claiming he's improved the economy. It is factually incorrect. The number of jobs added in 2017 was LESS than the last 6 years under Obama. The DJIA is up, but 80% of stocks are owned by richest 10%. Trump MAY improve the economy, but he hasn't yet.

Sure employees got bonuses but if like most working Americans, they have 401k accounts, the lower tax rate pulls stocks higher benefiting all. Simple economics!!

207 2018-01-11 22:25:50 Can't say much about it. Yesterday's unexpected dips made all weak-hands panic sell their stocks. It's a good time to buy and there's still people selling at low. I think we must hit average 0.0000120 $BTC before seeing any positive movement.

232 2018-01-11 22:12:30 Jaime Dimon is a greedy pig. Look how he's able 2 become a billionaire while his colleagues arent billionaires yet. On top of that his stock has risen more than all the other stocks of other banks.Hes able 2 do all that by cutting costs on all angles and paying his employees shit
233 2018-01-11 22:12:09 What do you mean?!?  It was bump stocks and "assault" weapons that made him do It!  Didn't you hear,  just being in the proximity of them makes you lose all self control and go on a killing spree!
234 2018-01-11 22:09:58 You know been in crypto currencies for a few years now, one thing is clear, the commentators #cnbc and #Bloomberg get, makes me realize how horribly out of touch they are, and how bad their reporting must be on stocks and bonds, ignore them.

316 2018-01-11 21:30:51 this is so true. My portfolio was only up 12% last year but I was at ease with my selections and I think there is always value in picking steady performers rather than the racy stocks that can treble or die. I will never get the amazing returns that some do but good luck to them

323 2018-01-11 21:27:41 Walmart stocks are continuously growing so while devesting in their Sam's Clubs they are investing in their continued growth of their Walmarts. And you named 3 stores when many more have offered raises or bonuses.

330 2018-01-11 21:24:51 Exc that 80% of the cuts went to the top 10% and corps, who didn't need a "wage increase."  And corps buy back stocks, not give raises.
331 2018-01-11 21:24:23 No way to prove this, but I'd guess the vast majority of investors would prefer the next 10% move in stocks be down rather then up.

362 2018-01-11 21:12:10 The biggest loser is our country. This tax cut is incr. debt by 1.5 trill.  This weakens our country.  Also, 30% of the ownership(stocks) for Major corps is foreign owned (China, Saudis, etc). So by-by to 30% of that tax $$. $1.5 trill could have been used for infrastructure.

386 2018-01-11 21:00:26 Yes, that's the economy we've created.  Most of the spending is done by the top 10% of US taxpayers.  The top 10% get most of their comp (via options/restricted stock) & wealth from stocks.  The Fed knows this.

398 2018-01-11 20:55:24 We expect to see much higher natural gas prices in the coming weeks with a potential of over US$5/mcf this winter. On any dips buy or add to current positions in natural gas stocks and the land drillers.

Does anyone know how to buy stocks of Nintendo when you're in US?!

(I really need the answer, thank you)
403 2018-01-11 20:53:28 LOL.... maybe they should use Coinbase. At least blockchain news for smallcap/microcap stocks have crazy action.
404 2018-01-11 20:53:05 NYC talking of suing fossil fuel co's (GLWT, you idiots); noticed that coal stocks strong this week. Look at $CLD go
405 2018-01-11 20:51:26 I do not think anything was meant maliciously. I know I started saving with Lending Club which was 25 bucks. Maybe someone couldn't afford the 25 every month but maybe in 4 months they could start. Penny stocks when properly researched also can be awesome.
406 2018-01-11 20:51:05 One caveat is when stocks are leveraged in some way. Same applies to Coins, which represent an instrument without a liability
407 2018-01-11 20:51:04 Ur an idiot. Any 401 or pension or life insurance is invested in stocks.

414 2018-01-11 20:47:54 I've traded crypto, invested and traded stocks and from my experience shorting penny stocks tends to be the most predictable strategy

420 2018-01-11 20:45:24 There is a whole school of traders on the payroll of various funds that play the options arbitage of when an earnings date is confirmed on momentum stocks.
421 2018-01-11 20:44:17 Which would be the reverse of what the last 25 year "plan" has been. Run stocks down while ignoring scientific advice. When stocks such as bass reach crtical levels, pretend its sea anglers that caused the problem.
422 2018-01-11 20:44:17 Increasing the deficit doesn't bother you?... for a tax brake that no one wanted & which mainly benefits the 1% more and for a lot longer than it does for that 90%?

And, what are you guys doing about 'bump stocks'?

Exactly. Way a to go to focus on 'what's important'

428 2018-01-11 20:42:49 @CDBaby_com_DP @Stocktwits It might impacts volumes on some stocks as the players all rush over to cryptos. Someone should study that.
429 2018-01-11 20:42:12 as a common denominator. Otherwise you need to hold stocks of every currency pair. If you want to trade THB to BRL, that might be uncommon so you need correspondant banks. THB -> XRP and XRP -> BRL might be much more common

434 2018-01-11 20:41:06 @sainsburys Hello. The upgrade of the Wood Green N22 branch is great- except you’ve cut the cleaning product range in half. It no longer stocks wood floor cleaner, only the harsh stuff. Barely any choice on the cleaning front now too.
435 2018-01-11 20:41:00 We see natural gas stocks as very cheap and oil stocks as relatively expensive. We recommend selling the oily names and buying the cheap natural gas stocks.
436 2018-01-11 20:40:41 Saw a note that volume in $GDX and $GDXJ is at multi-year lows. And sure. yeah. But volume in individual miners ($AUY, $HL, $KGC, etc)  is quite high. Maybe look at where the money is flowing? Now is time for individual stocks to shine

481 2018-01-11 20:21:58 You’re saying that they would do something (release info) if another  something occurred (Trump lead in the polls). If you’re that good you shouldn’t be on Twitter. Try out the stock market. Predict when it fails. Short stocks. STFU
482 2018-01-11 20:21:50 the whole piece officially done is your work yes. but the stocks and effects  you made to make it you don't necessary own. that's what im trying to say
483 2018-01-11 20:20:06 Volatile because it is very speculation and emotion driven. It's so early in the story of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Also volume is very low compared to stocks in sure, so more people are able to drive price...particularly big players.
484 2018-01-11 20:20:05 My god, what vile people. I'd bring back the stocks and let the public deal out punishment for such wicked treatment of animals. And for fly tipping.

522 2018-01-11 20:09:43 U.S. stocks rebounded from the first retreat of the year to set fresh records, as energy shares surged after Brent crude topped $70 a barrel for the first time since 2014. The dollar fell.

530 2018-01-11 20:07:14 They say that the best stocks to buy are the ones you already own, that’s why I keep adding to $fat. But damn do I envy the $sx holders! Took months for me to get from .13 to $1 and sx doubled that in a matter of weeks. Congratulations $sx

538 2018-01-11 20:03:52 @maxdermilian @Stocktwits To find stocks, I always start with the Zacks Rank of 1 or 2. That usually means rising earnings estimates.
539 2018-01-11 20:03:45 That moment when you look at cryptocurrency charts, and the stock market suddenly disappears off the grid from your field of vision. #Cryptocurrency #stocks #CRYPTOTRADER
540 2018-01-11 20:03:13 Yes, but why do you insist on ending in 2000 2.0 (i.e. right now)? Even more significantly, why are you changing portfolio composition? The relevant stocks to follow from 2000 until now are: CSCO, JNPR, JDSU, CIEN, INTC, DELL, MSFT. You know, can't miss, blue-chip tech companies.

543 2018-01-11 20:02:46 That being said, most of Amazon's wealthiest employees are wealthy for exactly the same reason Bezos is - on paper, their stocks/options are worth a lot of money. Increasing taxes on their income would have roughly the same effect: not much.
544 2018-01-11 20:02:17 I’ve set my 2018 stall out on the basis if the mkt closes for a year I’m relaxed about all the stocks I hold, looking at your portfolio I think you’re in the same mindset

It's not like it's something special. 

I had one when I worked at a crappy restaurant. 

Vast majority aren't going to buy the shares.
554 2018-01-11 19:57:04 Headline on #CNN financial today: "Stocks that Trump trashed on #Twitter are soaring." They have to find something wrong with #Trump . It's getting unbearable now.
555 2018-01-11 19:56:03 With regard to DGI: it turned out that this investment strategy suits best to my temperament and I just love building a portfolio with strong dividend paying stocks providing me with an ever growing passive income stream, taking advantage of the compound effect
556 2018-01-11 19:54:58 The #ATF is attempting to pass new regulations that would effectively ban "bump stocks." Not only are they attempting to do this without Congress or President Trump's approval, they are doing everything in their power to make sure they don't hear from you on this issue.
557 2018-01-11 19:54:11 by the way, the profit is 130K actually.
558 2018-01-11 19:54:02 Nope, but you will hear her bitching about corporations who trade pensions for 401k schemes in order to allow the wealthy to gamble with your retirement fund. 
The top 20% of Americans owned 92% of the stocks in 2013. Most economic gains now go to the top.

560 2018-01-11 19:53:39 Feels like a bit of a rotation from highly rated to better value stocks at the moment. Certainly the latter doing better in my portfolio at the moment. The 'buy the dip' on growth stocks which has worked so well recently may become 'buy the rollover'. Exercise caution!

Time to go.
564 2018-01-11 19:52:11 But they buy back stocks to increase their value and/or pay dividends to stockholders. Kind of same thing, right? (sarcasm)
565 2018-01-11 19:51:59 One guy makes the product. Another guy transports it. Another guy stocks the shelves. Another guy makes the sale. And yet another guy earned the profit. What does “earn” mean under these circumstances?

597 2018-01-11 19:39:22 The only way an index etf will beat B&H is the avoidance of a sustained bear market. It's impossible to beat the index in a bullish environment because the etf is the index. Alternately try using higher beta stocks.

606 2018-01-11 19:35:21 Question from a first time investor: Do stocks tend to rebound after dilution? I own $LEAF at an average of $28.75 a share and things were looking up until this announcement. Am I SOL?
607 2018-01-11 19:35:18 I me cards are stocks. New stuff is the more volatile stuff but if you know what you are doing you can make a ton of money fast. They are high risk stocks. Vintage is slower moving and more save. But can’t make nearly as much in a little amount of time.
608 2018-01-11 19:34:46 No you have to find someone to buy the crypto currency to cash out something like that stocks you can cash out when u choose automatically

630 2018-01-11 19:27:13 @trish_regan despite the appearance of a "rosy" economy utilities eg. water,electric& produce increased.

631 2018-01-11 19:27:03 Trading demand spiked to unprecedented levels in 2018, driven in part by demand for speculative stocks. Marijuana, notably.
632 2018-01-11 19:26:03 Over 75% of US citizens do not own stock. And yet, the media yaps on & on about stocks. The DOW is in most every newscast.  Yet we should care in this regard; the Corporations get richer by overcharging people, keeping wages low & students in debt. Modern slavery is alive & well.

644 2018-01-11 19:21:23 OK, spell this out for me. A relatively small number of highly-influential investors divest from fossil fuel stocks. Then what? How does the world improve as a result? Does ExxonMobil stop drilling for oil, just to get those investors back?
645 2018-01-11 19:21:08 Trump is working with his Goldman Sachs cabinet cronnies knowing Trump's tweet attacks on companies ahead of time...will drive the company stocks lower to sell short that company. Trump is using his office to violate SEC stock rules.

654 2018-01-11 19:17:10 I started messing around and reading up on stocks and Shit about 6 months ago. Watchin your money grow without doing anything is kinda coo
655 2018-01-11 19:16:49 I mean i can think of a few things i want lol ..... but I think some shares of some notable stocks would go a long way.
656 2018-01-11 19:16:36 What about his tax cut which has resulted into companies giving large bonuses to their employees? Reduction in the unemployment and many big companies returning to the US. US stocks going higher daily For once this guy has done a bit good than our own Pres @MBuhari
657 2018-01-11 19:16:35 Quite a jump from undelivered positions to market abuse....but hey, ho for AIM stocks see ‘casino’...but that’s a different matter
658 2018-01-11 19:16:28 No I’ve been debating. I’m not good at investing in stocks and such.
659 2018-01-11 19:16:14 Always surprises me when I put positions on through this platform how few clients are in those stocks and how many are long “traditional names” like Barclays and BT.
660 2018-01-11 19:15:19 MJ Stocks - Price Alerts - With recent Session's development & pull back consider accumulating more QUALITY MJ stocks for the long term.  Overall the industry and momentum are on our side. $ACOL $KSHB $VAPE etc...

677 2018-01-11 19:10:12 Good spot. Forget that these penny stocks are less than a penny!
678 2018-01-11 19:09:56 Notable in #markets today is what is/isn't happening. 
On the former: records for #stocks , higher #oil & stronger Euro.
On the latter: failure of US government bond yields to move higher after yesterday's scare.(10-year is 2 basis points lower at 2.53%,where it was two days ago)
679 2018-01-11 19:09:39 All my stocks are in the green today #Investments
680 2018-01-11 19:09:37 Long term, invest in stock market with stocks that pay dividends. Or GIC with interest. Never taxed. TFSA is Not part of any rif either like RRSPs.
681 2018-01-11 19:09:37 2/2  you're wasting your time. If analysts or reporters were good at picking stocks to outperform the market they'd be managing money. Analysts are helpful in other ways like helping you understand a sector or trends. But not in picking your stocks.
682 2018-01-11 19:09:19 मायालाई नै Stocks market भन्न थाली
त्यसैले मायामा Risk diversification गर्न थाली

माया पनि Investment गर्नु जस्तै त हो रे
सही sector मा भए जिन्दगी नै बन्छ भन्न थाली

मलाई पनि अलि माया देऊ न भन्दा

683 2018-01-11 19:08:52 Could someone explain whether gold stocks are a good investment or should I buy the ounce?

686 2018-01-11 19:07:00 @BarackObama is no way in HELL responsible for this economy. He's not responsible for stocks, jobs, bonuses, tax relief, companies coming back/building, hiring and THE BEST DAMN PAST YEAR IN AGES. Screw your Obummer, Jake. @POTUS gets all the glory.
687 2018-01-11 19:06:32 I’m still a newb. I know penny stocks can be manipulated easily. I’m just surprised this stock is so dependent on NR’s. They’re sitting on a figurative gold mine that will be more and more in demand at least the next 5 years. They can’t not make $$$$
688 2018-01-11 19:06:15 Trade volume is a beneficial tool when analyzing upward and downward trends with stocks. Definitely a useful indicator for any trader #stocks #trading #strategies #investors

695 2018-01-11 19:05:18 Would this be a legit use of blockchain?

A decentralized trading platform for stocks where users buy "stockcoins" which are then used to pay trading commissions, and miners earn "stockcoins" for processing stock transactions. #bitcoin #Ripple #cryptocurrency #Litecoin

705 2018-01-11 19:03:18 If you want to be remembered as being prescient then you have to time your "sky is falling, dump stocks" message hours before an actual correction.   I will release mine at  9:25 a.m. , February 13--Shrove Tuesday!

719 2018-01-11 18:54:11 I've spoken with many pro gun conservatives who also support some new gun control measures. I'm curious Rick, whether your stance is so nuanced. Any loopholes worth closing? Bump stocks OK? Whatever the answer you are still a valued anti trump ally.

721 2018-01-11 18:52:38 CNBC headline was stocks soar on earn beats. Surprise. CEOs & analysts have under promised to over delver for awhile now & investors get all giddy. The days of beats by pennies not by miles are long gone, when those people were honest. The foolishness of this game is most amazing
722 2018-01-11 18:52:10 Real world use cases are always going to win. Not everyone is an investor. Not everyone is going to buy Bitcoin to make money off of it. Plenty of people shop at Walmart but don't own Walmart stocks. The same applies to the #crypto field.
723 2018-01-11 18:51:50 I get really nervous with investing in block chain and crypto coins/stocks. It's going to come crashing down eventually just a matter of when. These companies don't really have much profits or a future they just say crypto and their stock rises a lot.

725 2018-01-11 18:50:55 hi, I know it's none of my business, but shorting microcap (nanocap?) biotech stocks can lead to bankruptcy, and I mean real one, where you owe your brokerage more than your entire net worth. There are examples on twitter of ppl that lost all and then some.

767 2018-01-11 18:40:32 People have worries about crypto, but as long as the people continue to trust and value it, that's all that matters. Of course rich stock investors don't want you to stop investing stocks and invest in crypto instead. You have to realize there's a lot of politics to it too
768 2018-01-11 18:40:25 yup! But it's alllll bullshit. I had better years with stocks like Qualcomm in the late 90's than I ever did holding a coin for 3 years. Seriously.

790 2018-01-11 18:31:18 Why do you sell your products for so much when you get so little in return? I really thought you guys were going to take off. You’re now easily one of the worst stocks and declining. #ineedanswers @fitbit

800 2018-01-11 18:28:32 When and if I could yessir I will. Although, All Star weekend is going to be at LA this year. Nike usually stocks the city hosting All Stars with a bunch of pairs. This means that you probably have a better chance getting yourself a pair than me. Lol.
801 2018-01-11 18:28:16 1/ individuals will drop the Medicaid, instead going to their local Emergency Room .. unable to pay, US taxpayers will still foot the bill for the sick and indigent

805 2018-01-11 18:27:41 He’s no Shinji Kagawa!
806 2018-01-11 18:27:34 $SPY made me trade again as the bull flag under .75 3 count was to clean we did punch on push by as this is getting silly need to be safe. #trade #stocks #invest
807 2018-01-11 18:26:46 I was looking for stuff that had been thrown overboard by US investors intent on chasing FANG stocks,seemed to be a groupthink that GameStop had no future but listened to their presentations and it was apparent that this was classic baby out with bath water territory #sofarsogood
808 2018-01-11 18:26:06 Walmart stocks more crap from China than any other retail outlet!  Are you looking for more retail jobs or manufacturing jobs?  I thought you were going to get tough on China?

810 2018-01-11 18:25:49 Ya, at 0.11. Only 7600 shares. I only have so much cash. Hard to pull from other stocks cause they are all so good
811 2018-01-11 18:24:30 Pay off my consumer debt and then put some in an emergency fund and the rest invest in some stocks.
812 2018-01-11 18:22:39 $CCIH 3.10 big break imo
813 2018-01-11 18:22:30 Hee hee, I see you switched from stocks to bonds. Did you read the Deutsche Bank report on inequality last year?
814 2018-01-11 18:22:27 Yup, likely most overbullish EVER. CBs ****ing with everthing these days to suit their needs - create inflation to justify more rate hikes, please the Saudis to get their IPO and protect the #Petrodollar, and boost stocks all at the same (banks and energy big % of S&P)
815 2018-01-11 18:22:04 @GlobalProTrader The oil chart soon to become the gold chart. Only the good Lord knows what the mining stocks are going to do/most likely nirvana. Maybe a pullback to 1312 before explosion occurs
816 2018-01-11 18:22:04 it definitely does help those stocks!
817 2018-01-11 18:21:04 I don't want to cause a mass panic or anything but @sainsburys are currently selling packs of four short crust mince pies for 10p. Whilst stocks last. #boughttwelve
818 2018-01-11 18:20:21 If you flipped USDJPY upside down that would be a flat top breakout formation; and since it works on stocks like a charm...

821 2018-01-11 18:19:50 Take the Steinhoff debacle as an early warning.

All stocks are overvalued. Especially traditional stocks. 

Shares like TenCent worth holding, but not the rest.

I may be wrong, but there's huge Market crash coming. 


822 2018-01-11 18:19:39 Lol not really... Please be aware of dead hot stocks

824 2018-01-11 18:18:30 If you properly manage your stocks you shouldn't have dead flies unless something is wrong with the stock. In that case you need to figure out what's a cause of mortality (bacterial or fungal infection, special nutritional needs, temperature, etc).
825 2018-01-11 18:17:47 Nice recovery for Team Canada as #cannabis stocks halve their losses.

Team USA is raring to go but they'll have to wait out that silly doping scandal.  Meanwhile, Team Oz will lace 'em up in four hours after a few days of healthy consolidation, er, rest. #cannabinoid #wellness

840 2018-01-11 18:11:50 Gotcha, at this point, RIOT could get down to that 50 day MA but the one thing about this stock and stocks like it, i.e. OSTK, ROKU etc. Is they are very explosive, so they literally can do anything they want at any moment!

842 2018-01-11 18:11:47 I concur. Congress allowed this. They broke the law by not enforcing it! Sell their 6 or 10 houses, stocks, bonds, companies, to pay for illegals! It’s their baby!, let them rock it!

844 2018-01-11 18:11:39 Eventually under capitalism the economy will stagnate or go through recession. Buying back stocks accelerates this
845 2018-01-11 18:10:53 The guy next to me is brokering an important real estate deal while he checks stocks on his laptop and I'm over here looking at tigers wearing spandex.
846 2018-01-11 18:10:48 Stocks up on record third shirt.
847 2018-01-11 18:09:58 @SEC_Enforcement Could SEC please check tradings in AMZN and BA? These mafia pumped the stocks to so high and if mkt is going to crash, everyone would suffer.
848 2018-01-11 18:09:38 You may have heard us featured on @bbcmerseyside! You can find our cleaning products with #BottleReturn at @ClaremontFarm, @ChesterHealth and at The Owl Tree in Birkenhead. @Drainswirral's online shop also stocks our eco sewage treatment products with local bottle return.
849 2018-01-11 18:09:36 Don’t think stocks give the same returns as Ive got from $XRP (and other Cryptos).
850 2018-01-11 18:08:53 You can apply the same logic to all pot stocks then.
851 2018-01-11 18:08:53 US Dollar Index too skewed $EUR (57.6%) *it’s poor “measurement of USD”. Misses impact of the $AUD $NZD & many other #FX. I prefer USD denominated #commodities, like #Gold $GC_F or #Oil $CL_F. USD going to go lower but won’t hurt U.S. Stocks, think #Yen vs. #Nikkei for reference.
852 2018-01-11 18:08:39 As soon as Trump got elected stocks started going up so let me guess that's thanks to Obama? Trump took away a lot of regulation which allowed companies to invest more hiring more people!Obama averaged 1% growth when u break it down.Obama did nothing for our country!
853 2018-01-11 18:07:50 I don’t believe in relationship goals but if I did I want Kim’s & Yeezy shit. Buy me stocks with my name on it.

856 2018-01-11 18:06:52 Would suggest we all buy stocks in those companies that provide the products required for automation.
857 2018-01-11 18:06:21 So far - best uses, for me, is cooking rice REALLY well and stocks going fast enough to warrant doing a second wash. I still braise my meats in my cast iron in the oven.

861 2018-01-11 18:04:26 Sovereignty never lost. UN fish stocks act regulates fish stocks.. That wont change. Check up how UK gov allocate their rights. Trade partners nowhere near the number or deal UK has now. Am afraid you've made my point.. U no understand
862 2018-01-11 18:04:07 Small view : i think one can find the right stocks to short rather waiting for nifty to fall.many opportunities for bears as well _/\_

864 2018-01-11 18:02:10 1/

Don't forget to take a look at our reports on stocks in the #Truck Machinery Industry.

Some thoughts from @KrisRosemann: "Demand  for heavy-duty trucks (class 8) looks solid, as do other areas related  to construction markets (access equipment)...
865 2018-01-11 18:01:48 Interesting again; and better than nothing (which, for the most part, was the situation for the majority of our UK citizens - although there were some stocks, at least of respirators, I recall; eg at Preese Heath, in Shropshire...

871 2018-01-11 17:58:37 Maybe Donny wants to trash good stocks so they are tanked then while they are cheap he'll snap them up and make the fortune he craves. His Ulterior motives are always suspect.
872 2018-01-11 17:58:03 I get that but stocks are just as vulnerable to speculation. From that aspect, I see no difference in market volatility.

876 2018-01-11 17:57:08 Well if dems win back house in Nov.try looking at the collapse of stock market.Why would you keep any $$ in stocks. DEMS HATE THIS ECONOMY SO WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY GOING TO GIVE US IF THEY WIN....?
877 2018-01-11 17:56:56 When will we stop measuring the economy by how well the rich are doing? Most jobs are part time with no benefits and most people don’t have 401k’s or own stocks!
878 2018-01-11 17:56:55 I think that is the problem.  People confuse stocks with fx.  Stocks = market cap of a company and the cost of ownership.  FX = the value of one currency against another.  Cryptocurrency shouldn't be so volatile on rumors because they aren't a stock.
879 2018-01-11 17:56:31 During the army I bought houses and rented them out. That income I used to then buy stocks... And then real learned fast about real estate and wall street investing. I had skin in the game way advance way then just reading some author about it hey hey.
880 2018-01-11 17:56:30 US gas production increased in December with the largest increase in the Eagle Ford region which increased 226,000 ft^3 / day.  Second was Appalachia with 77,000 ft^3 / day increase. So those gas stocks should rebound quickly.
881 2018-01-11 17:56:21 I had some weed back in December, I bought aurora and then sell for investing in undervalued companies. $SX and $FAT was one of them.
Now I'm looking at many undervalued stocks.

885 2018-01-11 17:53:53 Have to be diverse in this sector everyone is buying weed stocks. The easy money has been made. It's why 30% of my funds is in weed stocks. So many undervalued plays out there in a different sector . Trading 101
886 2018-01-11 17:53:30 Hi! Thank you for reaching out to us. We are still waiting for new stocks to arrive kindly try again next week.
887 2018-01-11 17:53:28 Stocks broadly positive higher with all sectors up except for 2 defensives: consumer #staples $XLP & #utilities $XLU
888 2018-01-11 17:52:39 Stock prices rising mean nothing to the average American trying to make ends meet. I own stocks that are doing well and I still worry about family finances.
889 2018-01-11 17:52:30 Have to be diverse it's why now I only have 30% of my funds in weed stocks. Easy money was made there . Now it's time to look at other sectors .
890 2018-01-11 17:52:29 I found out I had some money in a 401k account with Fidelity.  They suggested I invest in stocks.  Doing research now
891 2018-01-11 17:51:29 That’s the boy! You’re spending the dosh mate.. him and Origami Sushi already!
892 2018-01-11 17:51:21 Since 50% of the country holds zero investment, boosting the stock market won't help them. As you said, stocks go up via projected profit increase. That rules out price cuts, more jobs, and significant wage gains. Thanks capitalism...
893 2018-01-11 17:51:16 Yep, am still overweight on stocks atm but looking to buy more GLD/SLV on dips & add a bit more to ETH/LTC & BCH + ICOs

894 2018-01-11 17:51:04 It Seems bad news is better for stocks. And good news is bad for stocks.
895 2018-01-11 17:50:40 @sourew123 stocks are never to low to go down. I hope it goes up but to think it can’t go down will make you broke. Fast.
896 2018-01-11 17:50:26 Stocks were way up under Obama. The small savings on the front end of the tax cut won't overcome the loss of services on the cuts to vital services. Your friends sound like losers.
897 2018-01-11 17:50:09 Current account deficit, USD is getting ready to go through the roof. Smart money getting out of stocks at highs. Twitter experts ultra bullish. Junk stocks hitting upper circuits. What can go wrong 
898 2018-01-11 17:49:25 I am so old I remember when markets and stocks traded off of weekly charts. 
899 2018-01-11 17:48:49 Every time he opens his damn trap my stocks go down. Very frustrating
900 2018-01-11 17:48:46 A @hopenothate -style campaign for the Spectator is in order imo. Then again, nobody stocks it anyway and its only readers are weird High Anglicans with a hedgehog obsession

911 2018-01-11 17:45:51 If money is rotating out of housing it’s likely going to cover debt, and won’t be rotated into stocks or anything else (not directly... second order impacts to financial system but that’s messy)
912 2018-01-11 17:45:35 The top five stocks higher at noon today are $APC, $VIAB, $SIG, $APA, and $DISCA.

918 2018-01-11 17:44:04 Despite stock valuations already at record high, where is money coming from to buy stocks as Dow and Nasdaq reach new high despite bad jobless claims data.Smell 2007 financial crisis
919 2018-01-11 17:44:02 A for dummies book would be good! I lowkey just jumped in though bro. I got this app called “Robinhood” easy to buy shares of stocks and it shows you the growth and fall constantly of stocks. You have to do research though on what’s on the rise
920 2018-01-11 17:43:30 Un peu tout le monde savait,il y a aussi une réelle volonté des grandes enseignes commerciales à vouloir liquider volontairement ses stocks sans se soucier des conséquences sanitaires

925 2018-01-11 17:39:22 This is the mini me version of Trumps corporate welfare. We, the taxpayers, pay for companies to have more money in their stocks, bank accounts, ceo bonuses. The company can then decide to make more money any way possible: layoffs, off shore tax havens, off shore labor.

1011 2018-01-11 17:12:08 $WMT starting wage hike today is important for investors & economists. They don't raise wages out of goodness in their hearts.  They do it because they can't hire acceptable workers at the old wage & need 2 compete more effectively.  Bullish for inflation, higher rates & stocks.
1012 2018-01-11 17:11:43 It's not ideal but it's the here and now. I've worked 50-70 hours a week for like... ever. Still found time to learn to trade stocks, will still find time to learn to code this year. I hate bootstrap mentality but this is STILL land of opportunity

1017 2018-01-11 17:09:28 #WDHR - ~ Rapidly growing broad-market sales 
Yet another reason there's been a lot of buzz surrounding marijuana stocks is the rapid sales growth and potential within the industry. Regardless of the source, pundits expect significant yearly growth from the legal weed industry.
1018 2018-01-11 17:09:07 $WDHR !! A massive new sales channel on the horizon 
A third reason marijuana stocks were on fire in 2017 is the expectation that our neighbors to the north, Canada, will legalize adult-use pot by July 2018.

1053 2018-01-11 16:53:41 Those that keep bidding instead of hitting the ask on stocks already up on year-end bottom - or where longs secured bid to keep shares from iHub  flippers in 2017 Q4- will get left behind - applies already to $DIGX $INCC $APRU $BTGI $VMGI

1065 2018-01-11 16:51:48 $EXAS Exact Sciences stocks sometime traded very crazy.  Hard to see selloff sometimes.  Investors took the opportunity jumped in below $50 now are in good shape.  Will not see any selloff again, only Wall Street Investors did that once in awhile.

1077 2018-01-11 16:49:10 The only reason for the high stockmarked.  Is the buybacks . Companies are buying back stock . Butt to little stocks are available. 
So therefore the stockmarked rise .
After the dividents payout the stock's will go down . Wait for it .

1096 2018-01-11 16:43:17 I was in heavy at .39 cents and sold at $3.30.  I will get back in and want to around $3.  If they announce the licence next week i see it hitting $4.50 maybe more before a pull back.  I think when it is legal and people see the financials stocks will crash for a bit
1097 2018-01-11 16:43:02 Too much political bias in such polling. just look at what the stock market did before Nov 8th,2016 and after... Stocks are mostly speculative trading so the mood of the market is, to a large part, determined by the emotions of the traders until the concrete repercussions set in.
1098 2018-01-11 16:42:58 $TGTX  MC<650 mil -->Their crazy current valuation is one of the most undervalued stocks I've seen.
1099 2018-01-11 16:42:53 A lot of leadership stocks having their wings clipped. You got to decide if trader/investor - I have stops written down. Trading is often emotionally easier, but not neccesarily the correct call.. no right/wrong answer

1168 2018-01-11 16:19:55 The trends under Obama were moving in the right direction.  We are headed towards higher deficits, interest rates and inflation because of poorly considered macroeconomic policy.  The economy will have a sugar high followed by a crash.  Hope I am wrong because I own stocks.

1180 2018-01-11 16:15:48 I have both margin and cash accounts which I trade options on. Your broker wants to give you every warning that without risk management, you can definitely blow up an account. With that being said, if you use risk management, options are actually less risky than stocks imo

1182 2018-01-11 16:14:48 Julius Bär is bullish on value stocks, mainly due to improved earnings momentum and undemanding valuations. The latter should, in combination with the expected normalisation of the interest rate environment, support value stocks.

1183 2018-01-11 16:14:47 Though Ben Graham avoided investing in expensive stocks yet he invested around 25% of the capital in GEIKO which made him earn millions.

1361 2018-01-11 15:20:06 BUT, if something BO did when he got in office had caused it, then it really would’ve been BO’s fault & not Bush. Just like how stocks rallied on Nov. 9, 2016 when Trump won. BO can’t take credit for that. Nor could he take credit for it going higher after regs got slashed.

1372 2018-01-11 15:14:11 I think it depends on the real cause as to blame/praise. When stocks fell in 2008-9, it was bc banks lost $ betting mortgages wouldn’t fail. That began under Bush, just burst under BO. Once it turned around in 2011, he could’ve slashed regs like Trump 4 the same growth. He didn’t

1413 2018-01-11 15:03:54 Investors must be cautious that there is high risk, especially in short-term trades. Often such stocks trade completely divorced from their fundamentals. Short squeezes are common. Many stocks are nano-caps and have few shares outstanding; that makes them a target of manipulation

1697 2018-01-11 13:19:07 A small window on a much larger landscape. Meanwhile, children are without healthcare, Dreamers' promise is in limbo, veterans waiting months for appointments, mass layoffs, few bonuses, and half of Americans don't own stocks. (When they "correct", will GOP claim blame, too?)

1701 2018-01-11 13:18:36 Not all stocks are treated the same. The larger more popular names have the most price targets and coverage. Depends on the stocks you're looking at
1702 2018-01-11 13:17:13 The cool thing about the crypto market is that when I cash out my gains, I receive the exact same cold hard cash that I get when I cash out my stocks/bonds. If your in to making money and can make rational decisions, your missing out on another stream of income.

1855 2018-01-11 11:38:34 When trading stocks, it’s great to get tips or info from other people. But don’t let that drive your decision to buy or sell. Do your own due diligence!  Make your own decisions!
1856 2018-01-11 11:38:18 I’ve skewed my Indian portfolio to IT & industrials. IT has been battered for no reason - poor sentiment. All my stocks are same since 2011. I’ve made 3 sells since that period.
1857 2018-01-11 11:36:59 We may bet that technology stocks are way expensive but these have generated unprecedented returns compared to earlier generation of charmers like consumer discretionary on scale of decades. Expensive valuation does not indicate fallibility.

1880 2018-01-11 11:27:47 I used to actively flip out stocks into new vials every 2 weeks. For “sickly” lines (ie multiple mutations /double balanced). I would “clean” by selecting for live adults. So yes

1888 2018-01-11 11:20:10 Children’s savings accounts help students realize the “payoff” that college promises. Evidence suggests that children’s savings accounts may be a gateway not only to higher earnings as a college graduate, but also ownership such as stocks and bonds and more wealth accumulation.

1953 2018-01-11 10:21:49 You will always get a some people that do not show respect and honor we it is due. I am a crypto investor and trader. Mr. Buffet has a proven track record. For many years he refused to invest in FANG stocks, now he owns Apple shares 
1954 2018-01-11 10:20:54 When you look at where people have their money you will start to realize why they say and do what they say and do. Buffets got his money in stocks, what would happen when he start backing crypto who many ppl will sell shares to buy crypto? #crytocurrency

1956 2018-01-11 10:17:02 I guess hotel stocks are undervalues. May be ITDC which is more like a mid-cap and other small caps.

2122 2018-01-11 08:03:22 I agree with the magic of compounding. However the probability of 18% cagr is debatable. But yes, investment in good stocks or mutual funds over long period with risk assessment will work.
2123 2018-01-11 08:03:17 Yes, loss for 2017 was expected although loss for 2018 disappointing and no new Chairman! In a bull market, holding stocks like AUK can be frustrating as opportunity cost is always at the fore. Personally I am happy retain some locked up capital here in anticipation of a bid.

2299 2018-01-11 05:49:57 I don't look at it as being "right" or being "wrong".... 

I look at it in terms of what's the stock most likely to do? What is the overall trend? Is the trend UP or DOWN? Stocks in UPTRENDS will most likely continue higher until the uptrend is broken. The stock decides. Not me

2331 2018-01-11 05:29:54 I’ve had people explain cryptocurrency to me slowly multiple times and it’s just barely registering. It’s like nerds made fake money that Link finds in Zelda a real thing then barter and treat it like stocks. If I’m wrong just shhhh idgaf anymore.

How much money do you and your family expect to gain from those stocks?

We're waiting for your answer?
2339 2018-01-11 05:25:46 That's not the point! If I sell you mutual funds or stocks or bonds or any other investment I cannot predict the rise or fall of any asset or I'm liable. The only economists that are agreeing with him are on crack or on TREB's payroll.

2341 2018-01-11 05:22:14 + only if it is liquid, to cover a call on XPR. Which is NOT the case. So, investors with other assets might end up selling stocks to cover margin calls on XPR. If you face twin calls on both XPR and BTC, you will sell non-crypto assets to cover both. So contagion is not exactly+
2342 2018-01-11 05:21:45 Ok, but it also trades with the #bicoin 'basket' of other stocks and me thinks they all gap down tomorrow....barring any company specific news. PS I may pick up a few tomorrow on any major weakness for a bounce. Cheers

2346 2018-01-11 05:20:43 So I dabble in a range of passive income streams. Crypto currencies being one of them and also Stocks/Trading.. the currencies are where I make most of the income, and currently the flatness of the markets, well makes me rethink that side

2356 2018-01-11 05:12:59 Stocks are overvalued; fixed income yields are low. If you are wondering what do with your  money, here's a suggestion: Go spend it. You will drive consumption, grow earnings and enjoy the process.  Best use :-)
2357 2018-01-11 05:11:45 How much is news worth? What would you pay to know a storm is comming, or that your stocks are dropping? @washingtonpost charges homeless for information about their status.

2359 2018-01-11 05:10:20 It is a Mathematical triviality that capital accumulation causes profit rate to fall assuming of course that it is all put back to production and that demand remains constant. I think our reality is a bit more complex wouldn’t you agree? For example labor owns stocks, finance etc
2360 2018-01-11 05:10:10 The greatest part of the crypto currency crush is that money will pour into other stocks as safer havens. Action tomorrow could be steep!

This essentially means Canopy Growth $TWMJF is the proxy for market risk. Stocks won’t resume upward momentum until these LPs finish correcting & subsequently lead again

2373 2018-01-11 05:02:27 #45, u touting the lowest AA job #’s in history is b/c of u. It ain’t anywhere close to being truth. Can anyone name just ONE thing/policy that has gotten better - FOR BLACKS - since 1/20/16. Don’t name the stock mrkt cause a lot of black folks don’t owe stocks. I’m waitin!!!
2374 2018-01-11 05:02:09 there's some evidence that housing flies with dead conspecifics reduces survival rate. and i think i see some aid to my stocks when i let them lay, clear, and then debride. but i've not convinced myself yet. so asking the masses.

2377 2018-01-11 05:00:31 I have quite a lot of American stocks. And European. All are doing well. Thanks, Obama!
2378 2018-01-11 05:00:25 .@Bakari_Sellers schooled @mshields007 on @donlemon’s show. A few more stats for you all: 

1. 52% of Americans own no stocks 
2. 80% of the stock market is owned by the wealthiest 10% of Americans. 
3. 70% of Americans born into poverty remain poor into adulthood. Coincidence?

2382 2018-01-11 04:59:12 Me while in college: "after I graduate I'm gonna invest in stocks, contribute to a 401k, and save for a house"

2385 2018-01-11 04:56:02 no surprise. we do remember when stocks were traded on credit with nothing behind the shares. what is behind bitcoin? seems analogous to me.

2388 2018-01-11 04:54:05 Again, just say thank you Mr. Obama. All you mentioned was begun under his presidency. Trump merely riding his coat tails.  Unemployment went down 8 points during the last 9years, only OBE point lower since Trump took office. Stocks were already high.

2398 2018-01-11 04:42:44 Bill, most Americans don't have money in the market and won't see any benefits. Just a bubble from Corps buying back stocks with taxcut $$.
2399 2018-01-11 04:42:10 Selloffs like this normally do not end (bottom out) until something happens to shock the markets causing nervous money to bail out.  Seen this many times like 73, 87, 2008 related to stocks.  This appears to be the news which started it all.

2406 2018-01-11 04:35:42 I guess I still don't understand what you mean by "currency exchange" and why that's a trivial thing. The contracts can hold money themselves and disperse it according to rules. A ton of concepts can be distilled to that. Stocks. Bonded commitments. Kickstarters.

2456 2018-01-11 03:53:46 Most people don’t own stocks and don’t benefit from this. The job numbers are weaker under trump too
2457 2018-01-11 03:53:17 You can keep your optimism on this economy. I’m still getting emails at Christmas Season levels. I’m selling. ALL the stocks. Ha!
2458 2018-01-11 03:52:04 So far I put 20$ a night away. I started looking to invest some money into stocks(maybe) started making 1100 more a month going on a cruise in may and starting to FINALLY put myself my health first. Not that anyone cares but damn feels good to let people know.
2459 2018-01-11 03:51:52 I learned my lesson with internet stocks 20 years ago:  get rich quick schemes are a great way to lose your money. Better to learn to be happy living small. Anyone who thinks money=happiness need only look at Donald & Melania Trump's perpetual frowns.

2465 2018-01-11 03:48:51 So sad that every mass shooting has resulted in zero changes to gun laws. Not one law has been passed impeding the purchase of large magazines, bump stocks, gun show loopholes, or controls on rifles meant only for killing human beings, not animals for sport. #NRAhasnomorals

2482 2018-01-11 03:42:44 "When you make this kind of purchase, which you should never do, you are speculating, which is not a useful activity." 

We all speculate. That’s what we do when we buy particular stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds instead of others.
2483 2018-01-11 03:42:18 Stocks have been rising like that for the last seven years. American stocks have done well this year, but not quite as well as European stocks.
2484 2018-01-11 03:41:51 My thoughts:
1. "stock allocation for our new and existing customers differ" - Why?
2. "availability depends on the demand for the device" - So you have wrong allocation since new users have stocks and a lot from recontracting ones are waiting.

It's kind of strange. Every time I bought the upgraded stocks following analysts's upgrades, then the stocks went down in few days big lost. I also, noticed, every time stocks got downgraded after a few days, they went up a lot. Should I trust the analysts or not??

2523 2018-01-11 03:14:23 Rates higher and steeper is a tailwind for stocks as financials lead the way. Still not worried about inflation as technology and consumer trends suppress many goods prices. Gas still relatively cheap also. Let’s get this market melt-up goin!!

2594 2018-01-11 02:37:17 @CiovaccoCapital  Bond yields seem to be in the headlines a lot lately. What does history say about rising rates vs stocks? Is it concerning that the decades long low rate environment may be coming to an end?
2595 2018-01-11 02:37:14 Les gars c'est écris que y aura plus de shops qui les auront, pas qu'il y aura plus de paires (c'est possible mais c'est pas ce qui est écris là) c'est pour ça qu'ils précisent "In terms of LOCATIONS" et pas "of STOCKS" donc à voir.

2615 2018-01-11 02:26:50 What’s confusing about that? I think you are on wrong side of the whole pot story. Stocks may be ahead of themselves, but they aren’t close to as big as they will ultimately become (mkt cap). Explosive growth ahead.

2628 2018-01-11 02:19:19 Regardless, moves that benefit shareholders benefit millions of ordinary Americans. A great many people have retirement plans that grow when the stocks in those plans increase in value.
2629 2018-01-11 02:18:47 LOVE investing in regular old boring stocks.

So much money there and it's pretty damn easy if you stick with your methods.

2641 2018-01-11 02:13:40 Also those stocks are taxed at a pretty low rate. So he can't sell off without losing control, and he can't really pay his fair share of taxes. He's still probably a dick, but you're misrepresenting the actual situation.
2642 2018-01-11 02:13:39 As long as my stocks and retirement investments are making money they don’t have to care about me! I have family and friends who care about me! Keep law and order and let me keep making money Iam happy happy!
2643 2018-01-11 02:12:37 For energy investors the bargains are  in the natural gas stocks and the oil stocks are trading at lofty valuations. We recommend investors consider switching.
2644 2018-01-11 02:12:07 I dont worry as long as my stocks not travelling with nifty. else i will buy nifty options to protect. Is this right approach? :-)
2645 2018-01-11 02:12:04 Dude, are you a TNR/ILC paid promoter? Nothing wrong with that, but it would be nice to know at least. Because the amount of times these, let's face it, garbage stocks get mentioned makes no sense. For the record, I owned ILC from the spinoff.
2646 2018-01-11 02:12:02 He doesn't have that much money on hand. He's worth that much.
Most of that is in stocks, and it's the estimated value of how much his control over his business is worth.
If he sells off that stock to help people he loses control in the business.
2647 2018-01-11 02:11:41 Yes and what is the incremental bonus the CEO gets? The reason valuations of stocks have gone up is because the tax savings will accrue to the shareholders, thus yielding higher valuations. If all tax savings was disbursed to employees, stock values would likely not have changed

2655 2018-01-11 02:08:31 Commercial crude stocks fell 4.9Mb but this was offset by a rise in gasoline inventories of 4.1Mb and of distillate fuels of 4.3Mb. The net result was a small rise in the price of crude oil today.
2656 2018-01-11 02:02:10 Yes, but a different kind. Bitcoin is a crypto currency, but alternative cryptos are small, just getting started coins that have relatively high margins of growth. An analogy would be buying shares of google stock (bitcoin) vs penny stocks (alt coins)

2701 2018-01-11 01:32:02 No growth and income are value stocks that pay dividends that's where the "income" part comes from. So they're large cap stocks, which is the growth aspect, that pay a good dividend which is the income. Should have no bonds in them.
2702 2018-01-11 01:31:47 And they save their surplus revenues in the "Oil Fund". It has over US$1 trillion in assets, including 1.3% of global stocks and shares. In September 2017 it was worth $192,307 per Norwegian citizen. Not so Trumpy.

2708 2018-01-11 01:25:52 You could have argued that for the US in 2012. The ECB are still buying everything except stocks. $MIB $IBEX $SSEC $RTSI are all set to have breakouts... monstrous implications for most other markets, inc' the US.

2710 2018-01-11 01:25:13 Well, their fucking stock is like $300 plus!  What a joke!  For what?  Double Apple stock price for example, and triple even quadruple other more valuable stocks!  Drop the price of that stock about 75% might be a start!

2717 2018-01-11 01:20:47 Given millennials have a long investment time horizon, the efficient risk/reward frontier says young people should have a large allocation in the riskiest investments possible like small-cap stocks, Bitcoin is even riskier so they def should have an allocation.

2736 2018-01-11 01:05:30 Thanks John, great link. Yes absolutely, we need to consider resilience to stress & factors difficult to predict. But for many species, genetic heterogeneity, found in regional natural variability, will surely be crucial to that, rather than all-out nursery stocks & import risks?

2742 2018-01-11 01:02:35 Uncle Warren says stocks are not overvalued relative to interest rates.
2743 2018-01-11 01:02:12 I have objections. Comparing owning a home to owning stocks is not entirely germane. I either rent or buy housing. Compare owning to renting. If I rent I rent forever. If I buy I retire rent and mortgage free. This has to be part if the calculation not just valuations.
2744 2018-01-11 01:01:46 Remember the saying, with what I know now, things would have been different back when I started? Forget short cuts.  Small consitent gains, easier attained with simplicity.

2018 will see a variety of stocking trials (translocations? artificially designed brood stocks? other?) to "recover" at-risk westslope cutthroat trout in SW AB. No plan is publicly available. No statutory SARA action plan. My view? It's illegal.

#Brian Rich Billionares Portfolio,  Pro Perspectives. A must follow .

So, as I said last week, despite the quadrupling of the stock market, money may just be in the early stages of moving OUT of bonds and cash, and BACK into stocks.
2753 2018-01-11 00:57:27 This is a PRIME example of doing due diligence in regards to investments  I see a LOT of stocks changing their industry to blockchain, crypto or cannabis, just to pump stocks. I like $kodk, but this isn’t unusual at ALL. Don’t let FOMO make you make a bad investment.
2754 2018-01-11 00:56:39 Had annual physical today..told doctor I've been anxious this year and havetrouble sleeping..Doc  said, I have put more people on anti-depressants this year then any other year!!!  DT You are making these type of drugs stock price go up! Freak us out....drug stocks go up!
2755 2018-01-11 00:56:16 Buffett is being his typical Crazy rational, Brian do you invest play with stocks and bonds and options?

What was reported spins on that idea of a put option, but most of his investors would find it much too speculative as it is it was at 17 today it's at 13th
2756 2018-01-11 00:54:51 I would be pissed if he announced details from a phone call especially discuss her stocks. But I don't believe he ever spoke to her.
