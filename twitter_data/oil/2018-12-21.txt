13 2018-12-22 23:58:22 Hopefully this will bring down the price of CBD oil. Many people use it for pain, especially those in states that have no legalized marijuana use.
14 2018-12-22 23:58:17 Oh I’m concerned now. Your educated enough over the last 28 months, I mean weeks, sorry years- to understand the power of BP.

Everyone who's worked cattle understands the concept.
40 2018-12-22 23:56:52 By "swamp" you mean Exxon and Lockheed.  Its either one or the other that owns Trump big oil or the defense contractors so you don't make any sense.
41 2018-12-22 23:56:48 Well I just guess things are different now. Must be due to Climate Change..
42 2018-12-22 23:56:45 Armie Hammer is obviously the great-grandson of Jewish oil man Armand Hammer.
43 2018-12-22 23:56:41 The value we assign to natural resources is subjective.

Oil, land, animals, silver, and gold  are forms of vanishing currency people have used as a unit of measure to add value to the skills needed to acquire, or count these resources.
44 2018-12-22 23:56:29 Oil change. 30,000 miles on the new "kidneys".
45 2018-12-22 23:56:28 Syria is the only significant crude oil producing country in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Vladimir Putin covets this strategic resource. Can there be any doubt who Syria will turn to for defense support once the USA pulls out? What does Putin have on President Trump?
46 2018-12-22 23:56:23 Because without Alberta oil, oil will be coming from the Middle East with awful human rights records as they practice sharia law. Stay focused. It’s not difficult.
47 2018-12-22 23:56:22 Liberal here.

You would get me to vote for you instantly if you said approve all the pipelines, but have 40% royalty on the oil for Ev subsidy.

62 2018-12-22 23:53:47 Yes, if USSR sells oil to Poland for bad manufactures then it is losing. 
USSR was a very special empire that in order to maintain its political power was impoverishing both itself and its satellite states. So it was quite different from France/UK.

74 2018-12-22 23:52:39 So you're sending me a pic of a poorly designed wall/ fence, to prove what? 
Concertina wire on top and laced the entire height of the backside coupled with sprayed coating of imbedded broken glass would keep them off it. It's not 30 ft tall either.

79 2018-12-22 23:51:30 Mr. President,   TURKEY IS THE PROBLEM.. NOT THE SOLUTION..

They enlisted ex-ISIS and ex-Al Qaeda fighters to fight the Kurds and Yezides and will do a genocide against them and Christians.. and ethnical cleansing. 
They will occupy N-Syria where oil is and put islamist there.
80 2018-12-22 23:51:22 You don’t need pipelines to get oil out of The Newfoundland coast. KM bailed because our PM killed pipelines. If Trudeau can find a way to kill offshore oil, he’ll do that too.

87 2018-12-22 23:50:31 The USSR subsidized oil sales in exchange for its manufactures, but those manufactures were low-quality.
88 2018-12-22 23:50:19 Would appear it’s more prolific in the oil and gas industry though Graham. “From 2008 through 2017, 1,566 workers perished trying to extract oil and gas in America. About as many U.S. troops died fighting in Afghanistan during that period.”

100 2018-12-22 23:48:51 Too much sugar but fat is harmless as long as it isn’t corn or seed oils. Stick to lard, tallow, butter, avocado, olive & coconut oil and eliminate carbs.
101 2018-12-22 23:48:49 , that’s hilarious, palm oil or no palm oil ... no ma like the Bairbre ma! X
102 2018-12-22 23:48:48 Yup, I’m agreeing with your principles, but in a world where humans blow other humans up, start wars over oil and do unspeakable things to each other, what hope do you honestly have that we’re all just gonna stop eating meat, when we can’t stop killing and abusing other humans.
103 2018-12-22 23:48:45 Because of a basic bilateralism in trade everybody tried to sell overpriced "soft" goods and import traded goods like oil. The so-called "transferable roubles" that you would earn when running a trade surplus could not be used to buy goods from another country.
104 2018-12-22 23:48:38 Remember Lawrence of Arabia? What happened when the Arabs took over and the British stayed on the sidelines. Generations, thousands of years with oil creating wealthy 'kingdoms' who defend their wars between tribes using faith as basis. Russia tried in Afghanistan. did that work?

115 2018-12-22 23:47:03 Fantastic idea Mollie don't forget the reason Obama/Hillary were there- Arab Spring or Regime change in Egypt/Libya/Tunisia/Yemen/Syria- Oil & Gas pipeline -from Yemen thru Syria to Turkey- backing moderates (Isis) Muslim Brotherhood Al Nusra White Helmets etc- Supplying arms etc

119 2018-12-22 23:46:22 Hmm very interesting episode. My thought is that the only way they can keep oil prices higher is to go to war with Iran or Saudi Arabia. This would benefit the dollar, oil demand, Israel, arms suppliers, lobbyists and religious rivals. They’ll be thinking about it for sure. Bad.

139 2018-12-22 23:44:58 It is not exactly true. USSR used to subsidize Eastern Europe through cheaper oil for example. And trade generally never played much of a role in CMEA So drawing parallels with UK/France is misleading. These were entirely diff systems.

141 2018-12-22 23:44:54 Both parties have war mongers. So if Trump wanted to invade Iran and NK they will be for it. The same people will be calling him very fit for office. As long the Military war machine keep fighting, the banks keep pumping dollars and the Middle East keep producing oil.

154 2018-12-22 23:42:57 So long as there’s an oil pressure gauge, I’m in!
155 2018-12-22 23:42:57 I’m almost positive my hair oil is making my nails grow. It’s only been one week and I had to get a fill 
156 2018-12-22 23:42:55 My new oil makes my beard smell like maple syrup
157 2018-12-22 23:42:50 Andrew Sheer would commit us all to catastrophic climate suicide for fossil fuel industry profits. He works for oil and gas companies, not Canadians.

160 2018-12-22 23:42:24 Trudeau having dinner in Mali! How about lunch in Alberta.. build TMP and get the oil to market
161 2018-12-22 23:42:22 Mullens might be legit but over Marcus? It’s like I’ll take a fiat with a full tank over a Lamborghini that needs an oil change
162 2018-12-22 23:42:06 Nobody in the UK oil & gas industry denies that H2S can be present. Itis present also in farms, brewing, iron foundaries, storage silos, water wells, mining and a host of other industries But it is easily managed using standard controls.
163 2018-12-22 23:41:57 Fish pills? 
Is this the same as fish oil or krill oil; or is it something different?
164 2018-12-22 23:41:38 @davidhogg111   So the question is, who paid for the Fix?
165 2018-12-22 23:41:31 I have fracture my neck and back in a few places and other fractures I would like it very much if the GOVERNMENT would make cannabis oil a lot easier to get for people in chronic pain it would stop me taking S8 drugs and no side effects with taking cannabis oil.
166 2018-12-22 23:41:23 Odious lot! Draining their country's oil revenue , like there is no tomorrow!

170 2018-12-22 23:40:50 Who out here can help me change my oil. I ain’t got no jack or anything 
171 2018-12-22 23:40:46 I’ve considered this a lot in the last few weeks. You may be right but oil hit/almost hit a major descending trendline on the monthly chart at 76/77.
172 2018-12-22 23:40:37 The US is the worlds largest producer of oil. Why do we wage war? Christ the fraud.

174 2018-12-22 23:40:30 even if climate change data is BS, we still need to get off of oil, renewables also have to potential to be ECONOMICALLY sustainable by offering cheaper renewable electricity, you know LOWER power bills for everyone
175 2018-12-22 23:40:27 みちえちゃんとか誘ってタイミング合わせて行きましょうw
176 2018-12-22 23:40:25 Might help if USA stopped attempting regime change around the world to quench their thirst for oil and minerals.

179 2018-12-22 23:40:00 So, how big of a role does oil and gas play in your Christmas celebration?
180 2018-12-22 23:39:46 Thank you. I will. Happy holidays to you too.

I customize my Hungryroot meals by adding ingredients like MCT oil, ghee (घी), turmeric (हल्दी), and spices (मसाले) used in Indian cooking.
181 2018-12-22 23:39:37 And Russia now has free reign in Syria ...... and there oil but yeah you clowns are “debating” Israel while trump sells out the US
182 2018-12-22 23:39:33 Russia is the world’s aggressor. They have oil but need everything else. Putin used Trump.
183 2018-12-22 23:39:23 I hate when my brother asked if I checked the oil in the car like I’m suppose to know how to do that
184 2018-12-22 23:39:21 having a crush is actually a sign of madness. i need anointing oil fast fast

187 2018-12-22 23:39:08 @teraxwest ,Jo, and I actually came to Tyler to get her oil changed, not to go to santaland 
188 2018-12-22 23:39:01 Thank you so much! I picked up some aloe in town today and I already have vitamin e oil so thank you!

193 2018-12-22 23:38:00 oil on canvas and mixed media?
194 2018-12-22 23:37:58 they look really good wow? congrats on not burning down your house i definitely would while looking for like oil or something
195 2018-12-22 23:37:54 Totally agree we need strong leadership like we had back in 2003, Tony Blaire and even the Conservative leader Ian Duncan Smith we’re very decisive in sending other people’s  children off to die in a war over control of the oil and imagined WMD’s OH HOW I MISS THOSE DAYS
196 2018-12-22 23:37:21 Mines are dirty and dangerous! TELSA USES lithium, nickel, cobalt, aluminum oxide. Replacement EVERY 8 YEARS cost $10,000 and $8,000 for the 60-kWh and 40-kWh packs. LIKE A CELL PHONE, There will always be bigger and better BATTERIES TO BUY! WHY ARE MINES LESS HARMFUL THAN OIL?
197 2018-12-22 23:37:12 Utter delusion. But buying local oil isn’t on her radar, how much were you paid off by saudis?

200 2018-12-22 23:36:24 Can @radionz explain why we are paying for a 'biz for normal people' show that trots out oil and gas industry propaganda?
201 2018-12-22 23:36:23 so at the nail salon the woman was massaging my shoulders and made a comment about how tense i am ... then as i’m paying she hands me a brand new bottle of body massage oil and says she hopes i can get some use out of it  thanks for the reminder that i’m stressed and alone !!!
202 2018-12-22 23:36:18 Mr President, please know that lower oil prices negatively affects oil and gas industry here...some of your staunchest supporters.
203 2018-12-22 23:36:15 Recently I started using CeraVe facial cleanser followed by grown alchemists grapefruit facial scrub. After that I wipe down my face with diluted tea tree oil. I do this before bed every night.

207 2018-12-22 23:35:15 I only use miscelar waters and cleansing oils. Simple miscelar cleansing water, simple also makes a good oil cleanser if you can find it and the body shop has a really good one in I think (not positive) the almond collection
208 2018-12-22 23:35:15 There’s an ice cream store here called Cookie Dough Creations that uses oil exclusively.

Scoop of ice cream topped with a scoop of cookie dough.
209 2018-12-22 23:35:13 Scramble no oil. Super easy to digest and great protein source.

212 2018-12-22 23:34:50 Hmm. That would worth exploring imo. How it's funded would be the challenge. Norway saved it's north sea oil money, and I can't see huge support for tax rises in the UK to fund it.

215 2018-12-22 23:34:24 I don’t know why these news outlets do not tell the truth about northern Syria. The only want us there for the oil that is rich in north eastern Syria. That’s what Russia, Turkey, and Iran are trying to get, they are coming for spoil. We don’t need to be there. Trump is right!
216 2018-12-22 23:34:11 I got my mom an oil diffuser and I low key want it for myself 
217 2018-12-22 23:34:02 My dog started seizing uncontrollably for hours 2 days ago, he had zero balance or ability to carry himself. His hind legs had no strength. You wanna know what stopped the seizures and brought him to full recovery? Wasn't thousands spent on blood work & vet care. It was CBD oil.
218 2018-12-22 23:33:53 Q is also getting its oil from Nigeria.  Google it. The slaughter.  But I guess humans and woman rights are no big thing.
219 2018-12-22 23:33:47 Remember the last time repubs had control. 911, two wars, two economic downturns, two stimulus packages, record climb of oil and gas prices. Thousands of US troops injured and killed. Thousands of businesses closed, thousands of people out of work. List goes on.
220 2018-12-22 23:33:47 @FoxNews is running a shutdown clock.

223 2018-12-22 23:33:05 I bought coconut oil today does that mean that I’m getting my life under control?
224 2018-12-22 23:33:04 Unfortunately they will only be available at the game tonight. There won’t be any sold at the stores afterwards, so hopefully you know someone who might be able to get one for you at the game!
225 2018-12-22 23:32:50 Fully just forgot what a coconut was and said I used olive oil to take my makeup off
226 2018-12-22 23:32:46 Imagine getting a facial and there’s a hot towel on your face. You breathe in the most amazing essential oil smell and it smells like you wanna tip your esthetician really well. What is that smell?
227 2018-12-22 23:32:37 There is nothing environmentally friendly about any part of our oil sands
228 2018-12-22 23:32:36 This Christmas, I have sent you a special Barbie that is bathing an a barrel of oil! Have you received it yet?

Build the pipelines and stop shipping via rail you hypocrite
229 2018-12-22 23:32:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
230 2018-12-22 23:32:26 One time @blindandboujeee took my car to get the headlight fixed and came back with the oil changed, but a headlight still out.
231 2018-12-22 23:32:25 I’ve said this before but.., nobody I know even considers separation. I know a lot of oil and gas people from all walks of life. It’s a ridiculous, grab your balls, look at me, walkoff.
232 2018-12-22 23:32:16 Artist in ATX. On Instagram.  Mainly oil painting and ceramic sculpture.  Appreciate artists who are striving to be good at what they do.

235 2018-12-22 23:32:06 They will be sold in Ford Hall before the game as well at booths inside the concourse during the game as well!
236 2018-12-22 23:32:00 That’s one way or looking at it. Now, if we stop buying oil from the region, that might help even more. What’s your bet on that?
237 2018-12-22 23:31:19 Like chasing down illegals on horseback, pretty low tech,  once detected by sensor? How about a wall to deter the majority in the first place?

242 2018-12-22 23:30:18 Let's not forget:  the Kurds were our biggest allies fighting ISIS, along with fighting Iraqis in Gulf War I.  Saddam slaughtered them after we left GWI, and the Turks are trying to do the same to them now.  ISIS sold oil to the Erdogan sons to finance their terror.  A NATO ally?
243 2018-12-22 23:30:11 It’s funny you’re saying there will be no polluting anywhere yet your government want to put leaky oil pipes through First Nations lands, in the middle of important forests and across waters that support local drinking water for several communities.

251 2018-12-22 23:29:47 Snake loves oil. Who knew? 
252 2018-12-22 23:29:46 He should tho.. @realDonaldTrump Powell thinks it's a good idea to raise rates. Meanwhile oil is crashing, and all the economic numbers say he should have stood pat or even cut. We have no inflation, and all he managed to do was cause the market to crash. Seems fireable to me imo
253 2018-12-22 23:29:40 I hate, hate, hate coconut oil, however, I am out of body lotion.
254 2018-12-22 23:29:35 (*∩ω∩)
255 2018-12-22 23:29:10 I don't mind them at all. I'm in the oil and gas business. There are thousands that work in this industry. I'm just telling you that you can't pick and choose your laws. Is there something about that, you don't understand? You can't rob someone and go, dang, I don't like that law
256 2018-12-22 23:29:02 Feeling anxiety and anxious about everything this year ! Found and alternative to help instead of meds! Hemp oil it works !#hempoil
257 2018-12-22 23:28:59 I googled them and learned that their patent-pending white box technology diffuses the key and offers “immunity” and not just “protection” from key extraction.

Sure sounds like that white box is full to the brim with grade A crypto-snake-oil.
258 2018-12-22 23:28:53 Our right wingers are ANGRY but mostly they just hate Trudeau and love oil.  They are still nice people who could drink a beer with you and make jokes any day.  Politically unhinged but friendly in person. It’s a weird dynamic.
259 2018-12-22 23:28:47 mom got an oil change for my car when i was doing my christmas shopping:’)
260 2018-12-22 23:28:38 It does work. That's why we spend money repairing poorly designed fences now and NOBODY says just take them down.
Even @NancyPelosi says fences work but walls are immoral. Go figure that one out.
261 2018-12-22 23:28:29 whats that oil thats not gun oil but works better than gun oil
262 2018-12-22 23:28:29 That is the first time someone has explained redistribution in a way I could comprehend. Do you see it in a similar way Norway use their oil wealth fund?

265 2018-12-22 23:28:11 I mix baby oil with my lotion and it makes my skin SOO soft
266 2018-12-22 23:28:00 Where can I find a cheap oil change? My car uses synthetic oil so it’s pricey as hell but I’m poor so I need help.
267 2018-12-22 23:27:56 Pretty ironic to that when ISIS has control of the oil fields that Iran was buying the oil from them.
268 2018-12-22 23:27:44 Butterscotch Pie: Add 1/3 bags of olive oil, 3 pinches of sliced chicken & 1/3 handfuls of salt to a dish. Broil for 2 min and enjoy!

271 2018-12-22 23:27:24 Apparently there's a Bob Ross energy drink called Positive Energy and when my mom asked what flavor it was, I said oil based paint.
272 2018-12-22 23:27:23 I like to exorcise them nowadays by cutting them in quarters, rolling them in olive oil and salt and cooking them till they're crispy like potato chips.

274 2018-12-22 23:27:06 Check out @Patrickesque thread about all the oil & gas money Sanders took in Primary (including a couple that may be over legal limit) that doesn't seem to bother Sirota at all. But remember when St Sanders pledged he'd take no $ from oil & gas in primary? Lied about that, too

276 2018-12-22 23:26:53 why my moma made me drink allat oil 
277 2018-12-22 23:26:51 Donald Trump thought he could go steal Iraq's oil. No chance in hell he concluded on his own that he can't fire Powell.
278 2018-12-22 23:26:40 Finally, if Dems cared so much for the environment, why do they refuse to get on board with a #GreenNewDeal ? @NancyPelosi appointed someone that takes oil money and is weak on climate, refusing to ban members that accept fossil fuels. It's all a house of mirrors.
279 2018-12-22 23:26:38 Please for the love of god, don't think oil paint is the same as acrylic
The stuff is very dangerous and just paint with acrylic, it's cheaper and safer

285 2018-12-22 23:25:39 So be it. Refineries bad. That they happen to be what made bazillions for the Koch brothers just across the border is immaterial. But I certainly agree it is about time we shipped our own oil to world markets and cut out the American middleman. But takes 2 to tango.
286 2018-12-22 23:25:38 Lol
287 2018-12-22 23:25:30 Actually the " whole amount," was only a promise, very similar to all the others previous.
There was no lockbox with money in it ever offered. Just a hollow promise money would be allocated in the future, which we know never happens
288 2018-12-22 23:24:58 its best to make sugar cookies with olive oil instead of butter or margarine

292 2018-12-22 23:24:21 He didn't desert any allies.  If you mean the Kurds they are in cahoots with the Israelis for oil and gas pipelines, which obviously Turkey is at odds with. Let them hash it out. Absolutely right to get the hell out there. Allies? You mean Israel?
293 2018-12-22 23:24:06 All about me smelly secrets history questions..

excuse me while I stuff my face #yummyyummyyummy
295 2018-12-22 23:23:39 War monger doing his best to scare us. It’s time another country steps up to police that region.  Does he have a vested interest in their oil?
296 2018-12-22 23:23:39 Boy you look like penzoil high mileage vehicle motor oil with active cleansing agents.
297 2018-12-22 23:23:32 It would be nice if you can rub oil on them or paint your toe nails 
298 2018-12-22 23:23:03 I bought CBD oil today and it was orginally $50 but the guy said it's holiday season and since my day was bad he gave it to me for $25, thankful for that energy

303 2018-12-22 23:22:23 "Technology" by itself cannot solve this. Just dimm talking point. 
Drones useful, but dont have capability of UH 60. 
Cameras/ sensors work, but you still have to have horses, kind of ol timey, or chase down illegals on foot when you see them. Walls work
304 2018-12-22 23:22:19 Oil! I use Simple cleansing oil or something, removes 100% of my makeup and helps my skin!
305 2018-12-22 23:22:17 I made @PJ_Byrne a sandwich and he clearly said no oil and I put oil  I’m sorry ! &Thank you for being so nice !
306 2018-12-22 23:22:12 Burn gel saved my arm today after i splashed up a lot of hot oil on it. #owie
307 2018-12-22 23:22:06 I need to oil my scalp 
308 2018-12-22 23:21:54 Damn today was busy at the shop. Like The whole parking lot was full and people just kept pulling up. 
Oil change, pads and rotors all around, tires. Serpentine belts , a whole bunch of hoopla 
But I was getting that bread tho 
309 2018-12-22 23:21:45 Stoned Or stoning. Ass backwards society will revert back to the Stone Age.  When there is no more  oil it’s all over.  Elon Musk can take them out sooner.   They would destroy the western society if they could.  We should do it first
310 2018-12-22 23:21:40 Let’s see you count the externalities’ costs of oil extraction. Put a business case together before trying to ram your pipelines through. Level with the public Andy, - pipeline liabilities outweigh the assets big time. But you never talk about ALL the liabilities.
311 2018-12-22 23:21:25 Can an increased oil supply due to fracking in North America destabilize the Russian government?
312 2018-12-22 23:21:19 Iraq was invaded because Hussein wanted OPEC to allow oil to be purchased with the Euro and not just the US dollar
313 2018-12-22 23:21:09 Oops, He spilled at little oil right where the dems were trying get a foothold. Now watch what happens.
314 2018-12-22 23:21:09 xd we still need to pillage for oil
315 2018-12-22 23:21:06 3.5 months since ive been using coconut oil. Here's my thoughts. 
It did not reduce any lines. It did not cause new lines. My skin is still soft & I have noticed through our "winter" months, I have not had any dry patches of skin or redness. I'm ok w/ continued use of this. 
316 2018-12-22 23:21:00 Why are oil pastels always included in kids art sets anyway, they’re messy and finicky and hard to kill.
317 2018-12-22 23:20:07 Maybe now you'll stop lying about where Quebec gets its oil. Or likely not.

319 2018-12-22 23:19:40 @KathyCastorFL thank you for standing up for the oil lobby!
320 2018-12-22 23:19:32 I am itching after reading that. I put tea tree oil in the shampoo bottles now and serenity hasn’t had them since.

327 2018-12-22 23:18:28 That the status quo is unacceptable and we’ve had it. That we want a govt that supports the oil and gas sector and working ppl in general. That things better change for Alberta in confederation or shit’s gonna hit the fan.
328 2018-12-22 23:18:23 changed the oil on my car and covered in fluid, this is not good
329 2018-12-22 23:18:22 It may be just lavender oil to you but to me, it’s... paaaaiiiinnn

Usually, #stock markets moved up during the week of Christmas. Unsure if WTI will move in sync with equities although its chart pattern is similar to that of #SPX.
333 2018-12-22 23:17:36 Define the word"secure", for us that notice the 30,000 plus illegal aliens that pour into America every month. There are so many illegals here sending money back to Mexico, the remittance is more than what the country makes from their oil sales.
334 2018-12-22 23:17:22 Fucking $90 a bottle for CBD oil #sofuckme

337 2018-12-22 23:16:36 One time, my sister was really pissing me off so I poured vegetable oil on her hair brush. Bitch’s hair was greasy for weeks.
338 2018-12-22 23:16:28 Donald Trump did not give up the Saudi  arms deal. Because he didn't want Putin to have it. We are right now not dependent on Russia for oil because of trump Ed krassenstein is a lying troll Farm getting paid by Hillary Clinton
339 2018-12-22 23:16:23 PLEASE RESPECT MY #DuckRights @AnimalJam I still need my oil xd
340 2018-12-22 23:16:10 Randomly combined vanilla and a few drops of lime essential oil in my diffuser and it smells so good.
341 2018-12-22 23:15:56 Unfortunately as seeing in EU attacks on cities and gathering of the youth, not everyone comes with the same feelings. you go to another country, destroy it, steal their oil etc..kill family members then what sort of feelings you think they would have ?
342 2018-12-22 23:15:37 I deserve to be rubbed down in oil. That’s my mood right now
343 2018-12-22 23:15:30 That's a waste of time.  This isn't even about the wall.  It's pulling attention away from the oil grab in Syria.
344 2018-12-22 23:15:25 Keep forgetting to get an oil change...

349 2018-12-22 23:14:30 Exfoliate your face, neck and hands with a mixture of baking soda and olive oil. It is very gentle, and keeps skin very soft and smooth.
350 2018-12-22 23:14:24 Non-thc CBD oil? Your personal experience? Your knowledge based on reliable science from pub Med or NIH? Looking for info. Don’t promote products other than Young Living essential oils here please. I’m just looking for education. TIA
351 2018-12-22 23:14:19 Why is an oil rich country skint? Fucking great question.

355 2018-12-22 23:13:19 @jkenney so the 40+ yrs of the 'screwing up' of the oil management by the Conservatives & oil 'handlers' they had the GOLDEN GOOSE not planning nor not anticipating a possible down turn ie US EXPORTING world oil glut chnage in auto ie elec vehicles/more efficient....
356 2018-12-22 23:13:13 I think most 17 year olds use baby oil.

359 2018-12-22 23:12:11 Funny, Never seen @MaximeBernier at any rally supporting Canadians, whether it be for the Oil and Pipelines, or any other group.  He's too lazy to get up and vote for important matters, never mind support Canada.

363 2018-12-22 23:11:51 I remember when I believed in Q. I believed (only for a minute) that maybe someone on the inside was finally tell us the truth. Then it changed for me. It became a marketing tool for other tools to profit by and Q and those who follow it lost me forever. It's ez to sell Snake oil

366 2018-12-22 23:11:44 Turkey ready. Rubbed with olive oil, pepper and prosciutto. Stuffed with a meat dressing. Italian saugage, ground pork, lamb and roasted pine nuts. Add some bread crumbs and fresh herbs and a few cranberries. Yummy!
367 2018-12-22 23:11:42 Wow that's a really shitty thing to say. Not to mention the snake oil salesman is really ballsy coming from a fuckin "mirror therapist"
368 2018-12-22 23:11:41 Nail it off when oil was how much ? Didn't you know how many months they blew pipeline
369 2018-12-22 23:11:36 Yes, I quit the DOD on Oct 1 and left for the ND Oil Fields on Oct 3. Never looked back. Piss on the Govt.

Oh yeah, let's not forget those spiky ball things on the end of a chain.
373 2018-12-22 23:11:09 Oil paint and turp cause a toooon of health problems btw. The supplies for my painting class deteriorated the tips of the gloves I was using to protect myself FROM it. It’s highly toxic

375 2018-12-22 23:11:06 Then why not allow Energy East so AB oil can get to tidewater and NB refineries?
376 2018-12-22 23:11:05 I haven't actually! How does it work? Is it like a liquid oil or in tablet form? I'd love to see if I could get some and give it a go
377 2018-12-22 23:11:01 Olbas Oil >>> Vick’s (if you know, you know)
378 2018-12-22 23:11:01 So @GeoffRMartin and @DavidCCoon, if Higgs is so fired up about the need for the Energy East pipeline to bring Alta oil to Saint John why isn't he pressing for Nfld oil to come here instead of being shipped to Europe & the U.S.?
379 2018-12-22 23:11:00 LOL

And what, fail to get elected after trying 8 times? (A clown dressed as a dolphin got more voted than the Snake oil salesman Farage)

In any case, the city needs representing, not 1 single issue.
380 2018-12-22 23:10:57 Mexico should set up a ‘Mexico Wall Foundation’, tell Trump supporters Mexicans are paying into it, in a year’s time announce the total raised as $10,000, then use that money to purchase a six-foot oil portrait of Donald Trump building a wall and leave it on a rock at the border.

383 2018-12-22 23:10:50 How was the oil disposed of? Did the archbishop drink it?
384 2018-12-22 23:10:37 That oil rig is 
385 2018-12-22 23:10:36 Beto, u still haven't explained why you pledged not to take oil industry money during your senate run but did anyway. You owe people an explanation.
386 2018-12-22 23:10:35 Saute in olive oil a sliced onion along with a handful of mushrooms, 2 pasilla peppers, 2 Anaheim peppers, and a jar of roasted red peppers diced up. Add some salt and a few teaspoons of regular and smoked paprika.

394 2018-12-22 23:09:58 If anyone has had any success with CBD oil for themselves or pets shoot me a note.
395 2018-12-22 23:09:58 How do you do the icing? I can't use ready-roll as it has palm oil in and without any marzipan it's really hard to get smooth.
396 2018-12-22 23:09:57 I it won’t, because it’s the 21st and a barrel of oil is like $49.
397 2018-12-22 23:09:55 A lot oil money out there
398 2018-12-22 23:09:43 Totally works, but it doesn’t need to be disagreeable. Roast a whole head with olive oil and spread on hard/toasted bread.
399 2018-12-22 23:09:42 Why oil?
400 2018-12-22 23:09:20 Castor oil really does work well wow

402 2018-12-22 23:08:45 But ultimately, the earth’s oil would be much better spent in using it as a petrochemical than burning it as a source of fuel.
403 2018-12-22 23:08:20 Trumps been using more wall dialogue specifically a steel wall which makes ya wonder what cronies he has tied in with this. But I was thinking he might as well lay in pipe with nozzles every so often shooting flames burning oil, lp, gas whatever maybe even ethanol. This huge...
404 2018-12-22 23:08:06 fancy canned tuna is the most pretentious fucking thing. it's FISH in a CAN. and you want it to be packed in spanish olive oil? get out
405 2018-12-22 23:07:53 My son was the same hes now 24. We discovered lavender oil in a warm but not hot bath before bed. The more pure/expensive the oil the better and put 6 drops in a teaspoon of milk before you add to the bath. He still swears its witchcraft because it knocks him out.
406 2018-12-22 23:07:46 My second #TeamTypingFast shirt came in. Had to buy another one because some disrespectful as drop off oil fell on my white one. I needed you in my hair not on my shirt bisssh
407 2018-12-22 23:07:44 Jesus, man. Fair play to you keeping a smile in the face of all that. Hoping that things improve for you healthwise. Have you ever tried CBD oil? It's supposed to work wonders for spasm and seizures. Might be worth looking into, either with your GP or at a chemist.
408 2018-12-22 23:07:43 Agreed.  In the 80s,they stated they would only use organic veg in their products. That proved a bridge too far cost wise. They are values led and palm oil is the latest thing....but not particularly crucial to their average customer. Let's hope they guilt the other supermarkets.
409 2018-12-22 23:07:37 Leftists be like:
'Don't like Exxon not selling gas to you? Start your own oil refinery.
Don't like Ford not telling you about the safety recall on your F-150? Start your own truck company.
Don't like Pfizer not selling you that hypertension medicine? Get your own FDA approval.'
410 2018-12-22 23:07:37 Ok, I agree with this. I wonder why they want to annex these countries, they already are the biggest country in the world, it's not like they need more territory.
I have no idea if Crimea/Ukraine have oil or are strategic states.
411 2018-12-22 23:07:36 No one agrees with you about pulling out of Syria and everyone is quitting.  You don’t know what your doing and leaving our country in term oil!  Stock market is at the lowest in years and now a government shutdown!  Time for you to resign and get out of dodge!

413 2018-12-22 23:06:19 About time America stopped their foreign interference & conflict. 
Murdoch & Rothschild have purchased the oil rights in Syria... this will be interesting. The wealth belongs to its citizens.
414 2018-12-22 23:06:18 He framed it later by the org that pulled Beto from their list of recipients of oil money because of the CEOs.  That is all I know.

I think it's getting blown way out of proportion.
415 2018-12-22 23:06:16 Turkey bought oil from isis during isis's  peak

Like the Koran says - Do not befriend them coz they are friends of each other.
416 2018-12-22 23:05:58 Victoria’s coronation was a farce, beset with mistakes and conducted in the wrong order in parts. I’d be hugely surprised if the oil exists still, but I know that some of her wedding cake is still around.
417 2018-12-22 23:05:56 Also encircling what exactly? Encircling an empty desert which is not near the SA oil fields? SA needs sea trade not overland trade across Syria. I don't understand the importance of Syria in a Iran-SA conflict, other than Iran just generally trying to expand influence.
418 2018-12-22 23:05:46 When you've got snake oil to sell, facts are pretty inconvenient.

Just saying.
419 2018-12-22 23:05:41 @trevortombe if we focused on becoming a world leading oil and gas producer with the ability to transport our oil and gas around the world we would have a significant impact on global carbon emissions. The world and Canada win at the same time.
420 2018-12-22 23:05:35 @ZionNPS pretty park. Too bad our current administration, looking at you @POTUS @realDonaldTrump, doesn't believe in nature and would much rather drill for oil. #ResignTrump
421 2018-12-22 23:05:08 That does sounds like the title--a basically unsearchable series of vague words....still haven't been able to turn up the cover with an oil painting of a massive sea monster
422 2018-12-22 23:05:07 Syndication is oil
423 2018-12-22 23:04:49 That may be a reason but it's also surprising because Texas is one of the highest oil producing states and gas is still sells for $2.70 on the average.
424 2018-12-22 23:04:33 You can make a good salsa or even a chimichurrri with cilantro or some parsley. And avocado tomatoes garlic and onion. Little olive oil salt and pepper. Blend it up. It’s good. Omit avocado if you don’t have it.
425 2018-12-22 23:04:26 sooo my oil is leaking..
426 2018-12-22 23:04:22 Texas politician has millions in oil money? Shocking!
427 2018-12-22 23:04:19 I have seen you continue commenting about Iran being in control of Syria being a threat to Saudi Arabian oil fields. Please explain because Iranian influence in Syria seems more of a threat to Israel than SA oil fields. And yes Turkey controlling Syria is more likely.

431 2018-12-22 23:04:03 I specifically mean new jobs in green tech / energy. Obviously the long-play needs to be there, but why not let existing resources fund it? The punitive position against "Big Oil" is baffling. It's still what drives the majority of Alta's prosperity.

434 2018-12-22 23:03:40 We should focus on becoming an oil and gas super power. With Canada leading the way in oil and gas production we will have a significant impact on global climate change. Canada wins and the world wins. #abpoli

438 2018-12-22 23:03:11 Also can try to burn a candle made with essential lavender oil. It's a huge help and all natural...I always try it before I go to my meds
439 2018-12-22 23:03:11 A person at work today bought yeast rolls and canola oil. I read them as yeet rolls and Canela oil. 

My mind is on twitter even when I’m not.
440 2018-12-22 23:03:04 Took the guy who works the desk at the gym some beard oil and he told me he loved me and the fact that we (beards) look out for each other. 

Told him it’s a brotherhood, not just a fashion statement.

444 2018-12-22 23:02:39 Aye but that oil deal is Man City-esque. $50mil a year for 10 years as part of their Saudi Western program. Immoral, but probably keeps them in profit for next decade. Hopefully Tony Khan/his son is happy to challenge

446 2018-12-22 23:02:20 What about being the main sponsor of Daesh (ISIS) ? Erdogan bought plundered Syrian oil from ISIS and gave them free access through the Turkish border. Without strong Turkish support , ISIS would not have metastasized.
447 2018-12-22 23:02:14 When I dropped my new car off for its first oil change it felt like I was dropping off my child at its first day of preschool. #mymazdaisgrowingup
448 2018-12-22 23:01:54 Oh do grow up. Wrong side of history? This Mermaid fuckery and all it entails will, eventually, show itself for the snake oil Munchausen’s crap that it is. Well-meaning and gullible? No, more heart-sore, for the vulnerable youngsters being used & exploited by this 'charity'.
449 2018-12-22 23:01:53 Exactly.. I’m in NL and we have the largest offshore oil rig in North America yet we have Saudi Refined oil sent here !!!
Ludicrous

451 2018-12-22 23:01:48 A lie of omission is still a lie. He intentionally left out "individual donations" and reframed it as oil industry money, which is not how these things have EVER been calculated. It was a lie and unethical and rat fucking nonsense that should be called out as such.
452 2018-12-22 23:01:48 The invaders have temporarily given up fighting for the west's pipeline designs. On the proposed route the US and funded proxies were dug in deepest. Now, Syria can once again begin drilling and marketing its own oil, without outside destroyers preventing such normal behaviour.

470 2018-12-22 22:59:33 I find Balsonaro elected to Brazil one of the more scary recent events. His priority: to open up the Amazon to mining and oil. "One small stupid short term profiteering step for man - One Giant Catastrophe for Mankind" and sod the ancient tribes. Could tip us over the #EcoEdge
471 2018-12-22 22:59:33 They have "wiped out" many others and US occupied 1/3rd Syria including oil fields that belong to ALL Syrians of ALL groups!

473 2018-12-22 22:59:18 What is China’s climate plan. India’s climate plan. US climate plan. We can plan all we want but we need other countries to be in board as well.

475 2018-12-22 22:59:11 Only the t.v. & oil deals are profitable right now. This year's video game is the lowest selling ever. Merchandise sales lowest ever. House shows a money loser. They're publicly traded so all the stars are available to read. Stock price down 45% since September to.

477 2018-12-22 22:59:01 Essentially, we never had it in the first place. It seems to me everything's the same as it has always been -  Alberta must still be sending to market the oil they always have, providing, of course, there are markets in this time of over-production and a glut in the market....

485 2018-12-22 22:57:58 There was no rebuilding. The oil erupted from the vat and showered the kitchen. The floors were covered in oil, impossible to walk on. No one was injured. Everything just needed to be cleaned.
486 2018-12-22 22:57:54 We've tried marijuana, kratom, cbd oil, on and on. Nothing helps. As for the vaccine, it was a Tetanus Diphtheria booster, but it has the same aluminum adjuvants and other harmful ingredients as the Inactivated Polio (IPV) vaccine that's recommended for 6 month old babies.

491 2018-12-22 22:57:12 Thank you  I’m gonna look for an oil somewhere because tbh I don’t really prime that’s probably another reason why my foundation breaks up. I only use the ponds lotion

493 2018-12-22 22:56:52 US is already a net exporter of oil, why would they give a sh!t? And if you think Trump will still be Pres, you're smoking the good stuff.
494 2018-12-22 22:56:46 To affect global climate change. Canada can play a large role in becoming a world leading superpower for oil and gas and therefore lowering the GHG emissions around the world. Canada wins and the world wins. #abpoli

496 2018-12-22 22:56:40 Turbines and solar panels have been a disaster for Australia and Germany.  Criminal to think about oil and gas $ for inefficiencies that survive on tax subsidies
497 2018-12-22 22:56:22 THAT I was not aware of. I hope people will soon wake up and realize that most of the antipipeline protesters are being funded by foreign oil co’s...

499 2018-12-22 22:55:45 Anyone. If u just add water to your hair/skin and nothing else it will feel dry. Case in point, after you shower or wash your hands you know if lotion or oil is not used you become ashy regardless if you're dehydrated or not. That's why moisturizer is so important to use

520 2018-12-22 22:52:31 We definitely have platforms. As for accomplishments, if you consider endless warfare, record oil drilling, keeping thieving bankers out of jail, and allowing private companies to get rich off the backs of sick people “accomplishments” then that’s where we differ.
521 2018-12-22 22:52:30 Mhm. He spent 3+ weeks on vacation playing golf while Deepwater Horizon was on fire, then sunk, spewing millions of gallons of crude oil at a rate of 60,000 barrels per day.  He always had something to say about the leak, though he did everything to hamper response and clean-up.

525 2018-12-22 22:51:28 The asymmetry is not only in media. The constructive things that Democrats want to do, such as stop climate collapse, are more difficult than ob/destruction. The solution is simple. Prevent collapse by destroying an oil company, which is easier than building an alternative.

But like stretching in my sleep, walking stairs sets it off, crouching down on the floor sets it off, lots of things really trigger it. But that oil sounds great
533 2018-12-22 22:50:13 2018 year in review: no one did more for my sanity this year than Suds @JiffyLubeON oil change car detailing package deal. They detail the toddler right out of my car every time.  Also the oil change folks are lovely and the time sitting alone in my car is v. decadent.

540 2018-12-22 22:49:42 Has anyone tried CBD oil?
541 2018-12-22 22:49:17 Right - I recall that the north of Iraq been assigned to the Kurds, and  it's oil producing territory, at that.  Syrian Kurds could go there.

546 2018-12-22 22:48:50 So Elias, you would use the NW clause to overrule BC’s rights. Liz is correct, economy is booming in Canada despite the AB oil situation, also not all oil sectors in AB are suffering but those that are, are political fodder, also we ALL ‘pay’ transfer payments thru taxes equally
547 2018-12-22 22:48:37 That’s right! The B&N includes an exclusive epilogue and oil painting. The book actually has both 1st and 3rd POV! 
548 2018-12-22 22:48:35 Just another "good people on both sides" snake oil salesmen.
549 2018-12-22 22:48:28 Turkey is only going after the Kurds and u know that. Honestly Mr president don't understand y u will allow this to happen. Erdogan was buying low priced oil from isis . Ur a smart man there has to b something else behind this decision. But turkey going after isis is a joke

555 2018-12-22 22:48:03 I like coming to get my oil changed because it’s some alone time
556 2018-12-22 22:48:00 That's nice. I just spent $100 for an oil/filters change. I could've done it for half that easily.

572 2018-12-22 22:46:36 Good to know. I’ve sprayed canola oil in my hair. Not conducive to looking your best.
573 2018-12-22 22:46:34 #johngaltmoment @albertaseparate #AlbertaOil   Stop as John Galt did let the liberal elites try to live without oil just stop producing walk away
574 2018-12-22 22:46:32 Prepping car for long drive and finding that everything is at optimal conditions. Tyre pressure, oil, coolant etc is all good. Windows are clean and clear. 
The only thing I could find to rectify was the window wash- not quite full.
575 2018-12-22 22:46:06 1. The exclusivity of the deal
2. The Fragile capacity to repay
3. The _massive_ strategic importance of the littoral approaches to global maritime and oil traffic
4. The displacement of local fishermen and supporting industries, a long established contributing factor to piracy
576 2018-12-22 22:46:06 Call me the Gulf of Mexico after the BP oil spill cause I got gas boiiiiii
577 2018-12-22 22:46:02 I put oil on it 
578 2018-12-22 22:45:50 Except oil right?
579 2018-12-22 22:45:48 Just bought my dog CBD oil because, I’m not a regular mom. I’m a cool mom.
580 2018-12-22 22:45:46 The mission where you go help the indians fight at the oil place, the mission where you fend off the o’driscolls, the last train mission, the mission where you get John home from prison, the mission where you go and save Abigail ... one of those
581 2018-12-22 22:45:45 Oil and coal embody the gold rush mentality; get in there get it out of the ground quickly. Then get the hell out of there at the lowest cost in dollars as long as the wallets are filled.
582 2018-12-22 22:45:38 ... and as much as I hate war & hearing about soldiers being brought home in body bags, what I hate more is the prospect of Putin becoming totally dominant in the Middle East with control over a major portion of the world's oil supply, then moving on to Africa and south Asia.
583 2018-12-22 22:45:34 We just need to stop putting active oil wells on fire in Syria. That should do it 
Merry Christmas 
584 2018-12-22 22:45:30 It’s not even that. Alex is lying. Beto took more than $200 from 24 individuals who happen to be energy execs. It didn’t specify that they were major execs (a friend works for an oil company whose CEO has FIVE employees) or the ones on the pledge list.
585 2018-12-22 22:45:22 For now, oil will be used for vehicles. We are also thinking about incorporating oil in weapons for things such as flaming arrows.
586 2018-12-22 22:45:13 Hello if you like pain try splashing boiling oil on the inside of your right hand. Merry Christmas x
587 2018-12-22 22:45:06 Our afternoon member spotlight is Nancy Melchor, she offers Bob Ross oil painting classes at @HinesvilleArts the 4th weekend of e/month! #local #art
588 2018-12-22 22:45:00 One of the reasons I can't wait to have my own house... I'm tired of paying a fortune have my oil changed buy a guy that might be as qualified as I am. #MechanicsDaughter #FuckThatsExpensive #ChicksWithTools
589 2018-12-22 22:44:56 Tell Nigerians what you did with oil money for 16 years - Osinbajo tells PDP - osibanjo,tell nigerians what you too did with biafrans oil money for 4yrs now,propaganda govt.
590 2018-12-22 22:44:53 Some of y’all bitch need a oil change & a tune up. Y’all ran up a lot of mileage this year
591 2018-12-22 22:44:39 Well, there's a rub there.  I beg to differ a tad.  I love Beto, and I'm pissed at David, but there were donations from CEOs in the oil industry.  

I personally could care less, they were not large, not over $3,000.

But, it's not a gas pump attendant.
592 2018-12-22 22:44:25 Why would we want to pay for this medieval apparatus? We might as well have vats of boiling oil and catapults.
593 2018-12-22 22:44:22 En ce moment, le coût moyen de l'essence aux USA est de 2.27$ le gallon, ce qui équivaut à environ 60 cents le litre… oui, 60 cents le litre 

#BuyLocal is the way to go ... Buy Alberta oil
594 2018-12-22 22:44:19 But for real like my oil teacher told me a story of someone who threw out his oil rags and wound up catching fire and burning his house down! Those are hazardous waste for a reason
595 2018-12-22 22:44:19 Me: My back hurts :c
Parents: Want some pot oil?!

My parents are hooligans.
596 2018-12-22 22:44:11 Putin accomplished his objectives without starting a “hot” war: keep MIC war-friendly HRC out of the WH, install someone who will aid ’s $$ &amp; oil interests, & protect his plutocrat’s loans. Not bad, as coups go.  GOP complicity is the problem.
597 2018-12-22 22:44:10 馬肉でも食いながら飲みに行きましょ( ^ω^ )
598 2018-12-22 22:44:10 Shey you like Bread and Engine oil with chilled Zobo
599 2018-12-22 22:44:06 Yes it is salami, chorizo, ham, cheese, tuna, pate de foie, black chocolate, olive oil and wine, I like it very much.
600 2018-12-22 22:43:56 Even @cheezit have palm oil. This news has ruined my life
601 2018-12-22 22:43:49 Και όμως «φτηνά» την γλυτώσαμε κάτω από τες περιστάσεις. Εάν οι εκλογές το 2013 έπεφταν μόνο λίγους μήνες μετά, σήμερα θα στεκόμαστε γυρό γυρό που τες βαρέλλες καίγοντας βουνά από Κυπριακά δεκάλιρα για να βράσουμε.
602 2018-12-22 22:43:46 Its either that or canola oil, but now I'm on a mission: corn-less chips and tomato-less salsa
603 2018-12-22 22:43:43 I’m not an academic either, just a humble trader with a 2 week thesis that IF stocks rally from around these levels oil will go along for the ride...
604 2018-12-22 22:43:43 Exxon just pulled $25,000,000,000 of investment out of Canada because of all the uncertainly your Government plagued the oil and gas sector with.
605 2018-12-22 22:43:39 What problem is solved? It won’t raise oil prices, won’t get pipelines built, won’t help move more AB products like AGRI to market and creates all the costs associated with a sovereign country (defence, currency, to name two). Seems knee-jerk to a partly made in AB problem.
606 2018-12-22 22:43:33 See you looking like the groom 
607 2018-12-22 22:43:32 Face oil sih gue ngaruh walaupun emg lama wkwkw gua pake rice bran oil
608 2018-12-22 22:43:30 This the kind of concert where if u ain’t wearing button ups open wit baby oil covering yo chest gristle you a whole lame 
609 2018-12-22 22:43:15 Thinking about buying my sister an essential oil diffuser or Xmas so she can chill the fuck out
610 2018-12-22 22:43:14 Shut off oil to BC and turn off the money to Quebec simple as that
611 2018-12-22 22:43:11 Look. I don't really care...

But as a matter of fact, countries that have invested so much into supposedly "green" technologies, like Germany, are only increasing emissions. Why is that? Maybe the stats are wrong? 

BTW global oil output is increasing at unchanged rates, too.
612 2018-12-22 22:42:33 Yep. 100%. There's a sinister component to it. It's snake oil on steroids.
613 2018-12-22 22:42:30 I want to let you know that the Linda McCartney pulled vege "chicken" tastes wonderful cooked in oil and butter with a good dose of mixed herbs. Still add the water for extra bulk and texture. Just like stuffed roast. Serving it for xmas.
614 2018-12-22 22:42:28 I think I stepped in some woo. My shoe smells like patchouli oil, scented candles and hippy tears.
615 2018-12-22 22:42:18 Sana oil
616 2018-12-22 22:42:08 Lol they there for line 
617 2018-12-22 22:42:01 *hug* sorry oil face
618 2018-12-22 22:41:55 It's not just one thing. He also voted with Trump to open up offshore waters to oil exploration. The guy isn't a climate hawk. We need a climate hawk.
619 2018-12-22 22:41:55 Like Yemen, open knowledge what is happening there but we’re all quite happy to let millions die. “Oil” and “they buy our weapons” is a massive hurdle to jump before we’ll even slightly leave ajar our conscience
620 2018-12-22 22:41:49 Lavender essential oil & coconut oil mixed, also less baths (it dries out their skin and washes off all their natural oils) and Aveeno or however you spell it has really good baby lotions too! I wouldn’t put the essential oils on his face tho. Just his body!
621 2018-12-22 22:41:48 Buy local Canadian oil Cat
622 2018-12-22 22:41:48 Oil needs to be minimum $65/bbl to avoid massive layoffs in the industry. It is now at $45. I am worried that after xmas I will be out of a job, along with thousands & thousands of other oil & gas workers like me. It is going to happen unless price rebounds upward.
623 2018-12-22 22:41:39 2500 auto workers get laid off cry me a river the national does stories on how families may be impacted takes up half the federal news feed. 10’s of thousands of oil workers all ready laid off and suffering...... silence. It’s your exact attitude towards the west that’s done this
624 2018-12-22 22:41:38 They deserve each other
625 2018-12-22 22:41:34 Headgasket 99%. Because you say it doesn't blow smoke it looks like it's the portion between the pistonshead and the oil returning passages. Of course it doesn't overheat because of the quantity of the oil in the cooling water. You have to also clean the cooling system.
626 2018-12-22 22:41:29 Yeah well what do you think of THIS

[throws down a smoke bomb, leaving behind a note that says "I AM JONH GORT" and a burning oil field]
627 2018-12-22 22:41:02 1270. UCSD, UCLA, UCI all turned him down.
628 2018-12-22 22:40:54 Am not impressed, coconut oil can do better
629 2018-12-22 22:40:50 Pro tip for removing canola oil sprayed on a television: use alcohol based cleaning cloths for glasses and clean the television screen in small sections.  Repeat as necessary.
630 2018-12-22 22:40:46 同意
631 2018-12-22 22:40:44 Oil tariffs will never, ever happen. No way.
632 2018-12-22 22:40:41 Who the fuck calls engine lotion “oil”?
633 2018-12-22 22:40:37 Clarins Lip raspberry lip oil 

Best thing for super glossy lips
634 2018-12-22 22:40:33 He's not "right" at all. Individual donations do not mean "oil industry money". It's asinine to even suggest it. By that metric Bernie Sanders is the number 1 recipient of defense industry money, which is silly.
635 2018-12-22 22:40:30 The sure cure for lung cancer is to get rid of the REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & "OIL" CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS, EVERY PHUK'N ONE OF 'EM !!!!!
636 2018-12-22 22:40:26 If it’s big oil, where is the EPA , NASA and the air force in all this, they work for and are payed by us ? Why are they letting oil company’s , bill gates and others do this to the world ?? I don’t think it’s that simple....
637 2018-12-22 22:40:15 Thanks for the oil stained driveway @Dobbsauto Why can’t you do a better job on oil changes?
638 2018-12-22 22:40:11 Stew... wit enuf oil
639 2018-12-22 22:40:08 Pro tip: a bit of olive oil helps the fingers glide across the belly during belly massages. It's a bonding and soothing experience for both.
640 2018-12-22 22:40:04 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
641 2018-12-22 22:39:51 Always good to see the Blue oil frauds being found out x
642 2018-12-22 22:39:44 No oil no blood 
643 2018-12-22 22:39:38 Any kind of face oil? Where could I get some?
644 2018-12-22 22:39:34 Blabla; electric vehicles aren't so green. Their electricity comes from the power grid (oil, gas and nuclear, not generally solar power or hydroelectric). And:batteries have environmental concerns. So greater co2 footprint than gasoline cars in their entire life cycle.
645 2018-12-22 22:39:33 Reports say he was unbolted and hydraulics line was cut. According to police hydraulic oil was found all over the floor.

But yeah how did nobody notice????
646 2018-12-22 22:39:28 bubba: “there we go! now we’re cooking with peanut butter!”

@2ndamendmenter
647 2018-12-22 22:39:09 I was oil face
648 2018-12-22 22:39:02 All Albertans do depend on oil and gas workers to stabilize and maintain this economy. Trying to deny that is incorrect.
649 2018-12-22 22:38:47 Maybe try some virgin coconut oil? It’s actually quite good for cats, and it will help lubricate and make stools easier to pass. Works for humans, too.
650 2018-12-22 22:38:44 I have dry skin too and loooooved the NYX total control foundation buuuuut seriously mixing oil into the foundation does help a lot. For high end I loved the fenty foundation & urban decay all nighter
651 2018-12-22 22:38:41 ISIS is not defeated in Syria. And why retreating out of Syria and not Iraq? Because US is already too much involved with American businesses like KBR/Halliburton connected to Iraqese oil? Trump 'delivered' to Putin giving the oil/gasfields from NE Syria to Rosneft or Gazprom
652 2018-12-22 22:38:33 I thought he made a 400 or something on his SAT?
653 2018-12-22 22:38:17 Ask her if she wants a hot oil massage?
654 2018-12-22 22:37:51 I live in north Florida and today’s price for gas is 2.05. Have the oil companies forgot it’s Xmas and they are suppose to be sticking it to us. Maybe it’s Trumps fault we have cheap gas.  Damn dirty republicans.
655 2018-12-22 22:37:47 Pine oil heaven
656 2018-12-22 22:37:45 He is an absolute moron. He was born 4 feet from home base. He is a snake oil salesman. He would have been better off investing the money he inherited and doing nothing. He would have more money.
657 2018-12-22 22:37:41 @dpcarrington hey rocket scientist, 90% of Brazil's soy is pressed 4 soy bean oil which is nearly entirely consumed by humans. 70% of Brazil's soy meal gets exported to China, most of the rest is fed to Brazil's HUGE chicken industry, very little goes to Brazil's cattle
658 2018-12-22 22:37:40 Didn't someone insist on throwing out the original rancid anointing oil back in the 16th or 17th Century? Maybe Charles II?
659 2018-12-22 22:37:22 From individual employees. No Pac money. Contributions from oil is lower than those from occupations listed under human rights, non-profits, educators, medical professionals, hospitals, civil servants, publishing. No employee should be vilified for participating in Democracy.
660 2018-12-22 22:37:21 I think this damn Titan QB is covered in baby oil.. he's slipping out of everything
661 2018-12-22 22:37:20 Oil changes for newer cars are too expensive.
662 2018-12-22 22:37:19 character development level: they used lard instead of cotton seed oil in these dollar store refried beans! Thanks, @DukeU!! The Textile Heritage Trail Preservation Project thanks you from our very hearts!
663 2018-12-22 22:37:14 You’ll need:
Castor Oil + Aloe Vera + Vitamin E Oil + Olive Oil (add Vaseline if too oily)

You will need a Old Mascara Wand and a Small bottle. Mix together then apply a light layer on every night and morning
664 2018-12-22 22:37:13 I got a $30 oil change from Honda for seasons givings. 
665 2018-12-22 22:37:00 I saw that a family video is now selling cbd oil, and if that’s not a deep reach to stay alive I don’t know what is. #giveuptheghost
666 2018-12-22 22:36:34 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
667 2018-12-22 22:36:33 There are legal, soundproofed Oil Rigs hidden as office buildings in Californian Cities.
668 2018-12-22 22:36:03 they are slowly killing themselves, caring for your health should be a necessity. I think we Somalis would be like that as well if we used our oil sadly.
669 2018-12-22 22:36:00 Jackie Bear restores the lead.  goes to Flanny. 4-3 Oilers.
670 2018-12-22 22:35:58 Goddamn baby you thicker than some motor oil
671 2018-12-22 22:35:57 There’s Big Oil in Los Angeles?
672 2018-12-22 22:35:38 oreos but the cream is motor oil
673 2018-12-22 22:35:22 Shopping for my mom is impossible because everything has coconut oil in it and she's allergic
674 2018-12-22 22:35:20 looks like I will have to update my usual reminder about Labour on the SNP , from every leader since Callaghan- "Labour will never form a Westminster Govt with the SNP" , to now include " But we will with the political arm of the orange order the DUP".

Turns oot nae oil in NI.
675 2018-12-22 22:35:13 Really?  Read the list I sent you.  It's a list of some of the many things made with oil.  It's not just fuel for vehicles, it make and is used for every day items as well.  Including laptops, cell phones, etc.  That is what i want to know what you are giving up.
676 2018-12-22 22:35:13 The Islamic golden age ended due to the Mongolian empire. Then colonialism started up until the 20th century. Now it is about oil, protecting the US dollar and making money from weapon contracts. The West has invaded and bombed Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria and now Yemen.
677 2018-12-22 22:35:11 Love the passion, go Oil.
678 2018-12-22 22:35:04 RT @LivingSafely: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this December? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
679 2018-12-22 22:34:40 Red Deer ties it at 3’s.
680 2018-12-22 22:34:08 Veggie burgers!! U don’t crave meat !! U crave the salt, spices and the oil !!
681 2018-12-22 22:34:07 We tried another recipe and this one is MUCH better. That first one called for a CUP of oil?! Blech!
682 2018-12-22 22:34:06 This horse shit of big spending is so aggravating. Frydenberg’s government has spent 7 billion on drones, how much per asylum seeker? And tripled the debt. Surely eventually the Australian public will stop drinking the snake oil
683 2018-12-22 22:33:51 "Well, I definitely do. But that's because my nose is so well-developed that I pick up things most people don't.

... You smell like leather and oil. It's a good smell, even if it doesn't sound like it."

With her face in his neck, he scratched the back of her head, caressing.
684 2018-12-22 22:33:47 All you need is peppermint oil and then depending on preference, either a napkin/paper towel or steam from a shower/boiling water
685 2018-12-22 22:33:46 GOT HEMP Oil? We will soon. You can get it after January 1, 2019.
686 2018-12-22 22:33:33 Some fireworks in front of the Oilers nets. Results in 4 ejections. 2 aside. Guido and de Haas are finished for the day.

695 2018-12-22 22:32:32 Ike let the CIA and State start just about any wars and overthrows of democracy the Dulles Bros or their corporate sponsors wanted.  United Fruit in Guatemala. Oil companies in Iran. Vietnam. Cuba. Latin America in general. Middle East.
696 2018-12-22 22:32:17 10 ~ (Optional) If you want to do something a little extra, apply any oils such as avocado oil, coconut oil, almond oil etc. Oils are very helpful to restore any damage and to leave your hair feeling silky and soft!
697 2018-12-22 22:32:10 Then why do you buck up snd pay for them. You left wingers dont want oil and gas but expect Alberta to transfer payments. Well my friend you willing to pay???
698 2018-12-22 22:31:53 LOL, his farmhand’s confused expression during his looooong ass speech about olive oil and his shitty dad.
699 2018-12-22 22:31:48 Manchester City may be bankrolled by oil money and be buying the best players from around the world, but this is England and you are still owned by the Palace!  @CPFC
700 2018-12-22 22:31:43 @RevDrBarber please check and research CBD oil it saved my friend’s life and she had stage 4 breast cancer, her brother who is an oncologist made her take it along with chemo. Your brother is in my prayers
701 2018-12-22 22:31:34 get some clove oil! I had a dead tooth that was killing me and had to wait to get a root canal and clove oil numbs that shit up.
702 2018-12-22 22:31:17 Even had tissue oil applied on my face it’s all gone because of the tossing & turning 
703 2018-12-22 22:31:15 Wow, great reporting slapnuts. Do you ever report news? Oil spills, war in Africa, human smuggling, opiod crisis,. Do you know what news is?
704 2018-12-22 22:31:07 I have a very bad cold! Caught on the plane, probably. Sitting in bed surrounded by tissues, breatheasy oil, throat lozenges etc. Hoping a quiet day will make me all better by Christmas!
705 2018-12-22 22:31:07 Has your 6 year old escaped and is doing great oil jobs elsewhere  @oneplanetmikey  -?
706 2018-12-22 22:31:03 BS! Border security, yes and border wall NOT FLIPPING DIME. What's next, a moat with fiery oil and catapults.
707 2018-12-22 22:30:45 hello. Just got home. Took some cold medicine. Got an oil change. Bought some oranges. Bought dubby food. It's the love shot.
708 2018-12-22 22:30:40 @NAkufoAddo 
Dear Mr President, please I have a Christmas question for you.

Why does an individual who owns no oil reserve, cocoa, timber, forest, mineral deposits and with no work of over 30million people is said to be richer than our country?

Merry Christmas!
709 2018-12-22 22:30:31 I exorcise them with Himalayan salt, olive oil, bacon, and balsamic vinegar. Works every time 
710 2018-12-22 22:30:25 Bring them all home! Use our Navy to protect our shores, our Air Force to protect our skies and our Army to protect our borders. We have our own oil. Let the rest of the world take care of itself. 30 years US Army. Been shot at in seven foreign languages! Bring them home!
711 2018-12-22 22:30:24 There are 8 oil and gas companies that make over $100 billion a year. The top 3 each make over $300 billlion a year. The “money train” is in denying climate change, Jay, not preventing it.
712 2018-12-22 22:30:23 The cleansing, healing oil of the Holy Spirit is applied to our hearts when we are hurt or wounded.
713 2018-12-22 22:30:12 Even my mascara has cannabis oil in it 
714 2018-12-22 22:30:09 Jeremy misunderstands the meaning behind the term 'snake oil'
715 2018-12-22 22:30:05 RT @LivingSafely: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this December? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
716 2018-12-22 22:30:02 So much baby oil and steroids in one shot.
717 2018-12-22 22:29:43 It’s just me. No need for reinforcements . I can handle all the baby oil and powder and Vaseline 
718 2018-12-22 22:29:34 Foreshadowing of the next House term. Democrats will be boiled in oil by Trump.
719 2018-12-22 22:29:29 You look like the right material for a huge beautiful oil painting or something wtf I'm devastated
720 2018-12-22 22:29:22 @NTB has had my truck all day for a tire rotation, an oil change, and to fix the brakes they screwed up. The guys just keep telling me over the phone that it’s the next vehicle up. I’ve heard it three times today.
721 2018-12-22 22:29:22 Y’all only like darkskin women when they got wide hips, big titties, and oil all over them. But don’t want darkskin babies.  the most disgusting concept ever.
722 2018-12-22 22:29:06 Ποιός πληρώνει για να απλώσουμε την τιμημένη κιτρινόασπρη πάνω στους παγωμένους ρότσους;
723 2018-12-22 22:29:05 Doug Ford answers only to his mother, the religious right, Tim Hortons, the development/building industry, Big Oil and his hero Donald Trump.
724 2018-12-22 22:29:00 Imagine if Australia produced a shit load of oil? Imagine that
725 2018-12-22 22:29:00 How much was oil price when Obasanjo came to power?
726 2018-12-22 22:28:58 Precisely, something will happen that requires all the values you hope exist in the person you (or others) have elected. Both the last two responded poorly to BP oil spill and Katrina. Trump hasn’t the skill or the staff to manage a large event. IMHO.
727 2018-12-22 22:28:58 @enterprisecares got a minivan with smoke stink, oil change light and rattling noise in engine. Took to Ewr airport location to switch and had the worst customer service experience by an enterprise manager. Been loyal enterprise customer for 10yrs. Family of 7 now stuck .
728 2018-12-22 22:28:52 Combination of military tactical warfare applied here IMO. 
Armored Spearhead and Swarming, 
CA is the weak spot that the " spearpoint" can penetrate by concentrated pressure on a tiny area. 
Swarming, results in exhustion of resources = catch and release.
729 2018-12-22 22:28:37 Data is the new oil ; )
730 2018-12-22 22:28:34 Y’all need to stop buying those bootleg oil cartridges mannn lol
731 2018-12-22 22:28:27 Cod liver oil is great for battered nails, good for skin too, that's if you're not a vegetarian!
732 2018-12-22 22:28:26 What’s more devastating and hurtful to our economies climate change or the destruction of our oil industry. Get a realistic grip you fanatic .
733 2018-12-22 22:28:24 maybe now the hemp oil moisturizer i like won't be $30 for 12 oz 
734 2018-12-22 22:28:17 Feared would be the best. Balance of power is critical. US imperialism and wars for oil must stop!
735 2018-12-22 22:28:12 InshaAllah
736 2018-12-22 22:28:08 Damn that’s awesome so no Fatty oil or nothing.
737 2018-12-22 22:27:59 お断りします(￣･ω･￣)
738 2018-12-22 22:27:52 Science: CBD oil is essentially a miracle drug, I can help with heart issues, pain, anxiety, and more
Me: cool, so should I talk to my doctor
science: nah, I’m sure the dude at the head shop has a gummy worm or some shit
739 2018-12-22 22:27:52 I’ve just launched my own brand of face cream in time for Christmas.

It's called Oil of Ugly
740 2018-12-22 22:27:45 Buying local, such as oil from Alberta versus Saudi Arabia, right?
741 2018-12-22 22:27:43 X'mas 
742 2018-12-22 22:27:25 Justin Trudeau just doesn't care about the Western Canadian Energy Sector. The Oil & Gas Industry is very toxic right now in Canada and that is very unfortunate. Consumer confidence is down and Canada is headed for a Trudeau made Recession. How Nice
743 2018-12-22 22:27:15 Thank you Scott Moe for being the one premier who stands up for our Canadian oil and gas workers! I hope next year Jason Kenny will join you and go to Ottawa and kick JTs skinny ass
744 2018-12-22 22:27:15 I just saw your IG story on grape seed oil and I’m taking notes
745 2018-12-22 22:27:15 Our Good Lady & Lord within us all Judges everyone at death. I always felt Iraq & WMDs was a crime against humanity, when its real motive was oil&gas, as we passed beyond peak oil&gas production. Rapidly switch energy systems B4 O&G runs out, for 2days youth in a colder world
746 2018-12-22 22:27:13 Right now I'm using the argan oil one... Didn't realise there were about 10 
747 2018-12-22 22:27:08 Despite dropping hints and making, none too subtle requests weeks in advance for Victoria Regina’s coronation anointing oil, (it was every teenage boy’s dream back then); imagine my disappointment rushing downstairs, opening the Christmas packaging to reveal a bloody telescope!
748 2018-12-22 22:26:56 Is Lorenzo’s Oil Change taken as a band name?
749 2018-12-22 22:26:41 Richard it’s incredible how dumb many in society are who pretend to despise plastic because they are told to. 
We have to endure dolts who think oil plastic should be replaced by plant plastic from hemp etc.
So millions of hectares of biosphere destroyed instead of a 5” oil pipe.
750 2018-12-22 22:26:39 @MaynardsBassett For the first Christmas in years, I didn't buy Liquorice Allsorts, Wine Gums or Jelly Babies - and won't until you lose the palm oil. Please consider alternatives. (I realise there isn't any in Jelly Babies; not buying anything of yours on principle.) #BanPalmOil
751 2018-12-22 22:26:27 Mix a few drops of face oil into the foundation and it helps a lot!
752 2018-12-22 22:26:13 I hope they pass medical here so I can get the oil for my tremors. Medical CBD oil
753 2018-12-22 22:26:06 Yup.
754 2018-12-22 22:26:03 34 (12-22): USGS identifies largest continuous #oil and #gas #resource potential ever
755 2018-12-22 22:26:01 @coldclimate Thank you for the card! The newsletter could only be more Oli if it was deep fried in a barrel of hot oil 
756 2018-12-22 22:26:00 Garlic is the golden ingredient of savory food, it’s so good and magical that on its own with some olive oil it can revolutionize pasta, it can give taste to bland chicken..it’s just one of the nice things that God decided to give us. 
757 2018-12-22 22:25:57 Really glad you’re clear again. Cannabis oil is really the best cure for a lot of things. I take it for my anxiety and depression. Really helps me relax.
758 2018-12-22 22:25:39 As long as I get regular access to CBD oil and edibles, I'll consider that two times the lotto. Fuck Creed and the Pats
759 2018-12-22 22:25:29 うらやますい

761 2018-12-22 22:25:02 I've found your CI work very valuable for gauging if oil is over or under "valued" from the reality of inventories & price usually reverts to the yield curve. Of course issue on my side of things is timing though where I need to use raw price data/patterns to find an edge
762 2018-12-22 22:24:58 Moonpig got another late afternoon. My resting my laptop are worried about Engie Benjy, Engine oil it
763 2018-12-22 22:24:52 Aev'stuo, archdemon of mullets, cries tears of engine oil, which form into a pool; lemurs gather around the pool to drink. #Aevstuo #mullets
764 2018-12-22 22:24:37 look critically at biased sources when they offer hokum and snake oil

768 2018-12-22 22:23:53 Al-Bashir isn't above using violence on his people. 

It's probably why he was the first Arab leader to meet Assad recently.  Make any friends he can get.

I wonder what caused that inflation spike this year. The S Sudan split, w/ it's oil, was a few years ago already, so not tht
769 2018-12-22 22:23:39 I would use a BEAUTIFUL, EFFECTIVE,  STEEL SLAT WALL W RAZOR SHARP POINTS AT THE TOP.  If I don't have that it's Tear gas, rubber bullets, laser taser tag, fire hoses and maybe a catapult with hot cauldrons of oil.
770 2018-12-22 22:23:30 Oil spill
771 2018-12-22 22:23:27 Well shit

*jumps in vat of hot oil*
772 2018-12-22 22:23:20 Valvoline can do an oil change on two vehicles faster than Wendy’s can give me a damn salad!!!
773 2018-12-22 22:23:13 Weimer with a couple of big saves to start the 3rd. Still 3-2 Oilers.
774 2018-12-22 22:23:12 *technomodernist voice* inspiring! elon musk stops climate change by investing $5 billion in a giant freezer in the arctic, saving millions of oil execs!
775 2018-12-22 22:22:59 I’m wacthing the Lucas oil late model dirt series
776 2018-12-22 22:22:51 Cut in half, toss with salt, pepper, olive oil, roast in oven until crispy - OMGWTFBBQ. So good.
777 2018-12-22 22:22:32 Manmohan Singh managed well during the high crude oil prices in the international market & financial crises of 2008.
But what NDA government is doing will lead to financial crises.
They don't have any respect to reputed institutions.
Wait for the economic recession in India.
778 2018-12-22 22:22:29 come oil my hair for me..
779 2018-12-22 22:22:17 I agree. spreading the load across more time would have allowed the market to settle and adapt to the changes over a longer period of time. kinda like gas prices with oil; rocket up and feather down. the fed is trying to take advantage of it, but they're not being smart about it.
780 2018-12-22 22:22:16 What oil?  There have been lots of claims that America is in for the oil, but not one American tanker of oil has made it here without the approval of OPEC and payment.
781 2018-12-22 22:22:06 No Jason, you're my friend  so therefore I won't dare mention that for the 10 years that we were in power under @stephenharper and you were the minister we did f*ck all to bring Alberta oil to new markets. So let's blame the @liberal_party together for our mistakes. Luvs ya! XO
782 2018-12-22 22:22:04 csp also has a super good community that makes it real easy to download brushes. I used an oil brush pack from there for some of the blending.
783 2018-12-22 22:21:49 おぱっよーーーー！
784 2018-12-22 22:21:36 Disagree. Price vs CI contain every aspect of oil system dynamics. Doesn’t mean we know how to interpret it correctly.
785 2018-12-22 22:21:31 Someone: Do you do essential oils?

Me: If you’re talking about whatever oil @ChickfilA uses, then yes. Yes I do.
786 2018-12-22 22:21:23 Also palm oil tastes like candle wax.
787 2018-12-22 22:21:19 It's hard to discuss this rationally with an Albertan without having a gut-wrenching fear that you're in for constant craziness. I'll try. First, IMHO you need to take any path toward keeping oil in the ground, diversify your economy away from oil and encourage any alternatives.
788 2018-12-22 22:21:08 No groundnut oil did
789 2018-12-22 22:21:07 #Pressurewasher Tips: Always check the oil and gas levels on a gas power washer. Only use unleaded gasoline.
790 2018-12-22 22:20:53 Baby oil, duct tape, baby powder, Vaseline... what kinda game we playin? 
791 2018-12-22 22:20:50 Lmao I might as well changed my oil too
792 2018-12-22 22:20:46 It’s disappointing to see a blogger you’ve followed for years change so much and turn into a snake oil salesmen and post softcore porn selfies and go from preaching body love to getting boob implants and shit. Like ugh. This women can be better.
793 2018-12-22 22:20:35 Unless he uses the time stone/reality stone and changes the course of history like Babangida’s Almagamation of Nigeria and The 1999 amendment/delaying the discovery of crude oil for 2decades then yeah sure
794 2018-12-22 22:20:22 I made ramen for dinner 
I added seaweed, chicken and olive oil 
795 2018-12-22 22:20:17 So stop exporting coal that BC sells to China and cut off foreign oil shipments to Canada.
796 2018-12-22 22:20:16 3-2 Oilers after 2
797 2018-12-22 22:20:07 Rachel...your entire career has been about shutting down industry.  The oil industry in particular.
798 2018-12-22 22:20:01 omg ;; use it a lot!! or use oil too if i'm not mistaken owò
799 2018-12-22 22:19:48 First I pulverized the herbs and then soaked them in the oils like coconut or grape seed. Then strain the oil and add your butters like shea or cocoa and some beeswax
800 2018-12-22 22:19:40 yes let the nations in the middle east get control of their terrorists. esp since they are all rich with oil money. if not for the west (jp getty) the middle east wouldn't even know what to do with oil. let's remember that.
801 2018-12-22 22:19:35 ???  Our tax to iran?? I think i remember diff than u!!the banks here hoarding  russian spy sabbotauge money same banks doin same for iran money fm oil. Both given back to owners of said $$$ i think i remember
802 2018-12-22 22:19:18 I am dying at the transition. From plantain frying and oil on the bed. To follow my page dedicated to mental health sksksksksksksksk
803 2018-12-22 22:19:15 All these primary 6 cert holders will come online and be speaking grammer, the ECA of an oil producing country was depleted from meager $2billion which is  shame to $600 mil in 1 week, and you are here talking to me, issorite
804 2018-12-22 22:19:15 Vegetable oil comes from soybeans, not corn
805 2018-12-22 22:19:10 We have oil also.
806 2018-12-22 22:19:02 Lol olive oil 
807 2018-12-22 22:18:56 < #油song の曲目から、中の人が主に誰のペンか想像がつくと思います…ふふっ

809 2018-12-22 22:18:48 What do you know from Iran, Oil and Javad Zarif but you are not allowed to talk to the Iranian people
810 2018-12-22 22:18:30 She is not of royal descent, she's just the daughter of a really, really wealthy oil baron. Also a model and martial artist, which are profitable careers for her~
811 2018-12-22 22:18:26 Uh-oh, I ate too much bacon, egg, cheese, bagel, potato salad, beef jerky, burger, butter, smoke meat, chicken parm, sausage, shrimp, lasagna, turkey breast, avocado oil, and cheesecake.
812 2018-12-22 22:18:26 What about cauldrons of boiling oil
813 2018-12-22 22:18:23 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
814 2018-12-22 22:18:23 And plastic the SAVING substitute for enormous quantities of forest timber, stone, metal & transport fuel. 
Most plastic is made from what was a waste byproduct of oil refining. Actually, so was petroleum & nearly 50% of every oil barrel- just waste. Minds made value from waste.
815 2018-12-22 22:18:17 I have searched half of nyc for almond oil this is ridiculous.
816 2018-12-22 22:18:17 I know it maybe hard for you Andy but there is more to this country than just the oil industry in Alberta. As a person that wants to be Prime Minister, you should know that.
817 2018-12-22 22:18:15 Out at full of early rose oil being the throat.

819 2018-12-22 22:17:57 What do you know from Iran, Oil and Javad Zarif but you are not allowed to talk to the Iranian people
820 2018-12-22 22:17:53 8 years of good oil revenue and 3 years of poor oil revenue. Looting is 10 times the difference.
821 2018-12-22 22:17:47 Mine is almost 19 and started having them a little over a year ago. We give him CBD oil for dogs and he’s only had 2 in the last year. Highly recommend @VETCBD, it saved his life, good luck!
822 2018-12-22 22:17:41 Wondering how many months the new secdef will last , former secstate was oil exec , look how long he lasted , only Don T knows in whose pocket he is sitting
823 2018-12-22 22:17:40 
824 2018-12-22 22:17:33 I bet he also got a splinter from the true cross and a thorn from Christ’s crown. Historians say the oil was not possibly genuine.
825 2018-12-22 22:17:32 Do some CBD oil raffles, that'd be pretty fun
826 2018-12-22 22:17:28 What do you know from Iran, Oil and Javad Zarif but you are not allowed to talk to the Iranian people
827 2018-12-22 22:17:25 #ImperialUSA never ever left Iraq, who was protecting the oil fields in the east on the Iran border ??? who was always embedded with the @1StrugleOfKurds since the Iraq2 war against WMD?? 

And how is it good news for Russia or Iran that the Kurds get massacred??
828 2018-12-22 22:17:22 この前入って良かったセラピストさんが年末出勤多いから、そこでメンエス納めにしようと思います
829 2018-12-22 22:17:15 This power struggle between patriarchy oligarchs religious corporate monetary arms/war manufacturers oil/gas control for regional dominance in the middle east is more than pipelines as Entire nations lives depend on flow of oil/gas monetary system
830 2018-12-22 22:17:03 How can you listen to a "doctor" who wears gold chains and has oil in his hair?
831 2018-12-22 22:17:02 It’s not just the ‘economic sense.’ The world has changed and shipping oil sands - upgraded or not - is going to go to zero. Alberta needs to prepare for that.
832 2018-12-22 22:16:59 Literally the first thing he does in MOS is save the guys on the oil rig.

And that's before he's had a single line of dialog.
833 2018-12-22 22:16:56 I have the very phial of Oil of Clovis used by Dustin Hoffman in Marathon Man. Yours for a tenner, guv'nor!
834 2018-12-22 22:16:42 An “increase of efforts” to get rid of the occupying force while you are at it would be even more effective in spreading your message across and widening your audience. Without that, you will be forever preaching to your faithful few, and not a single person more.
835 2018-12-22 22:16:42 A few dozen barrels of whiteangelica oil?
836 2018-12-22 22:16:36 Literally all my homies work at Toyota fixing cars and stuff and they hook my baby up and all i went for was a oil change
837 2018-12-22 22:16:34 いいじゃないの…泣けるのよ
838 2018-12-22 22:16:29 CBD Oil Fun Fact #4: CBD May Actually Fight Cancer. Although research is still ongoing, a study indicates that not only is CBD effective in helping with various symptoms associated with cancer treatment, but it might also have properties that hinder or destroy tumor cells #cbdoil
839 2018-12-22 22:16:28 Oh well, it’s probably all for effect.  But you are right, heating a  house these days can be expensive. Our oil tank is cracking and we need a new one or they won’t bring more oil...£1400 eeek...we have enough oil and  we are saving up like billio bad time of year too.
840 2018-12-22 22:16:23 What do you know from Iran, Oil and Javad Zarif but you are not allowed to talk to the Iranian people
841 2018-12-22 22:16:19 Go ahead try living w/o fossil fuels .. I guess you are ok with getting oil from foreign countries.. Seriously wake up!
842 2018-12-22 22:16:15 What do you know from Iran, Oil and Javad Zarif but you are not allowed to talk to the Iranian people
843 2018-12-22 22:16:03 What do you know from Iran, Oil and Javad Zarif but you are not allowed to talk to the Iranian people
844 2018-12-22 22:15:51 Given Adam’s oil/stock correlation thesis (both topped on the same day), would mean we’d likely see a tradable rally in stocks too...
845 2018-12-22 22:15:50 hoes don't get cold it's time for me  to skirts and tights/thigh high socks , summer is coming, shaved legs will be back with coconut oil
846 2018-12-22 22:15:46 My mom had knee surgery and has had a metal joint inserted. Apparently asking if she identifies as robosexual now and making oil can motions isn't funny
847 2018-12-22 22:15:46 Vitamin E oil will help a lot with any scarring that may happen. Aloe Vera gel will help with any pain you have. (i know this is super late but i hope you’re okay)
848 2018-12-22 22:15:39 I use Pond's cold cream.. it says make up remover on it, and its lotion. oil based is also good.
849 2018-12-22 22:15:22 Try @afrobotanics hot oil 
850 2018-12-22 22:15:20 Give it a rest you paranoid person your hands are still dripping with blood on previous war in the Middle East divide and conquer and create war so you can steal oil wealth and in return sell arms and weapons so the circle continues
851 2018-12-22 22:15:09 What about buying Canadian Alberta oil to avoid foreign and expensive oil ?
852 2018-12-22 22:15:09 every night a oil up this totally ripped fucking appendage n tense it like a six pack in front ae a mirror 
853 2018-12-22 22:14:57 Have you used the CBD oil? I’m interested in trying for anxiety.
854 2018-12-22 22:14:50 Found a dead mouse in our cooking oil today. It scared both Evil and I. The mouse chewed a hole in the plastic bottle and fell in and it couldn't get out. We threw out the bottle.

858 2018-12-22 22:14:07 Facts matter.  Quebec is as hypocritical as it gets. Without oil equalization your "balanced budget" is a deadweight utopian nonsense. Quebec is a basket case without rest of Canada. The reverse is totally untrue!
859 2018-12-22 22:14:02 Can you ship him with olive oil?
860 2018-12-22 22:13:54 Anointing oil fall on you.
861 2018-12-22 22:13:42 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
862 2018-12-22 22:13:41 Just because a product says it contains sustainable palm oil doesn’t mean it only contains sustaible palm oil. It’s notoriously difficult to trace and like for cotton unsustainable products will infiltrate the ‘sustainable’ chain @RSPOtweets
863 2018-12-22 22:13:39 Scotland has moved on since 2014, it matters nought what we use as a currency, we will still sell our oil in US dollars.
864 2018-12-22 22:13:32 So we're leaving a strong de-facto Kurdistan in control of the oil wells which once nourished ISIS, NOT in the control of our de-facto enemies Russia, Iran and Syria, and we've left "our" Kurds in a stronger position than the Kurds that threaten Turkish national security.
865 2018-12-22 22:13:23 Hi I run a social media account for a dog AMA about CBD oil
866 2018-12-22 22:12:45 Just take $5 billion of the $15 billion given to oil and gas industry each year.
867 2018-12-22 22:12:32 Damn you sure do love fracking and bill Clinton and oil huh
868 2018-12-22 22:12:23 You wait...this kid will be AOC's running mate some day
869 2018-12-22 22:12:13 裏で走るしかないですね(笑)
870 2018-12-22 22:12:11 Wow this has to be the most stupidest excuse for a Schumer shut down yet...Trump was ready to sign the bill with only 5.7 billion funding and Schumer refused to sit down and hash it out. Oh and we are one of the largest oil EXPORTER and do not need the oil... wow do some search.
871 2018-12-22 22:12:10 Lets pollute the drinking water but no oil is aloud to flow.
872 2018-12-22 22:11:36 We must be in the same mindset. I use cinnamon essential oil in my toothpaste recipe for that reason!
873 2018-12-22 22:11:21 very blissful especially when the red oil is all thick and hard from harmattan air passing over it.  yummy
874 2018-12-22 22:11:16 Wait, first it was Bush (both of them) and his cronies who wanted all the oil, then it was Trump and his billionaire buddies...now it's Trump helping Putin get the oil? 

875 2018-12-22 22:10:54 I really invest so much into keeping my hair healthy and shiny. Biotin supplements, tea tree oil, organic shampoo/ conditioner, coconut oil. I never use heat. Like twice a year I use a flat iron. And this bitch still has the audacity to fall out in clumps. WHY
876 2018-12-22 22:10:51 I need a oil change and some brakes 
877 2018-12-22 22:10:46 I'm not a trader but understand that traders must trade. If I were a trader, I'd take a break from oil for now.
878 2018-12-22 22:10:41 4/ Solar and wind are imploding fossil fuels' prospects in the electricity sector. Transport will (agonizingly) slowly decarbonize, as will industry. Still-huge oil demand tho: plastics/petrochemicals. (Less emissions-intensive than metals, glass ... unless they're burnt.)
879 2018-12-22 22:10:40 Tell Nigerians what u did with oil money for 16yrs Osibanjo Funny isn't? Profs  ask questions which they already knows d answers. In this case, this particular professor seems to have experienced a short term memory loss amnesia if u like. Prof it was used to elect Buhari in 2015
880 2018-12-22 22:10:38 Be careful with MSA here. Has done a remarkable job but heavily tied to energy industry employment levels. Stock go destroyed during the last oil downturn
881 2018-12-22 22:10:28 Finally did my oil pan on my240 . Hopefully that’s where all my oil was leaking 
882 2018-12-22 22:10:12 Shut up about environment, if you really care you would not have protested against pipeline or have people on your team that want to shut industry down.  Pipeline way safer and farmers would not have to compete with oil for shipping grain.
883 2018-12-22 22:10:07 RT @LivingSafely: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this December? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
884 2018-12-22 22:10:04 I try cooking and oil is ready to explode GREAT
885 2018-12-22 22:10:03 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
886 2018-12-22 22:10:01 I agree Art little has been reliable in this environment. I approach oil mostly from the technical analysis side, these patterns provide a slight edge under normal circumstances and also a way to manage risk when wrong (ie they fail). Big fan of your comparative inventory work!
887 2018-12-22 22:09:55 $1.1b Malabu oil bribes: Swiss to reveal Nigerian beneficiaries.
888 2018-12-22 22:09:46 There was never anything anywhere in the Middle East worth fighting over. The moment we started producing enough oil ourselves we should leave the Middle East for good.  Israel included.
889 2018-12-22 22:09:36 I would like to see a climate change policy that does not simply look at reducing our carbon footprint but takes into account how our (industralised countries) demand for resources is leading to deforestation etc in third world countries. Palm oil being one example.
890 2018-12-22 22:09:25 United States  is currently leading the world in oil and natural gas production. We don’t need Syria. Let Putin put up the trillions of $ for the reconstruction. Make a safe space for the Kurds.
891 2018-12-22 22:09:17 Nope, they are on Christmas break but there will be one on the 29th
892 2018-12-22 22:08:50 i was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna
893 2018-12-22 22:08:43 And it turned out to be Fake oil too.
894 2018-12-22 22:08:42 How appropriate: A tribute to the #BigOil President of modern times by naming a freeway to honor his accomplishments.  An environmentally disastrous major oil spill would have been a more fitting tribute.
895 2018-12-22 22:08:37 USA have two big millitary basses in Quattar and Bahrein. From there can control all.USA dont need middle east for oil.USA problem is China and his influence on that region.China economic connections with Iran.
896 2018-12-22 22:08:25 If it was piston rings, there’d be smoke. You’d be burning the oil and that would produce smoke
897 2018-12-22 22:08:18 But u also don’t really need them lmao tell them all u want is a basic oil change

903 2018-12-22 22:05:37 Word of advice: if buying only one thing like car oil dont go to walmart today. It is busy!
904 2018-12-22 22:05:27 3/ RCP 8.5 (worst-case scenario) assumes nat gas and oil run out, so the dominant fuel of the 21st century is ... coal.  Won't happen, so worst-case IPCC scenario won't happen (unless unknown feedback loops bite us, always possible).
905 2018-12-22 22:05:15 @Toyota @ToyotaMotorCorp I have driven scions since 2005 . My 05 Scion xB did not use any oil till I got over 200000 miles . It currently is still going with almost 300000 miles and only uses a quart of oil every 6000 miles on full synthethic oil . Do better Toyota . You failed!

910 2018-12-22 22:04:31 What is China’s climate plan. India’s climate plan. US climate plan. We can plan all we want but we need other countries to be in board as well. To lower overall emissions Canada could become an oil and gas superpower and lower overall  GHG emissions around the world. #leadership
911 2018-12-22 22:04:22 A warning though- white bread sprayed with olive oil (e.g. PAM) and then toasted is addictive . If you used like country crock spread- it tastes even better. Fyi- Toast it on medium heat- turning every 15 seconds or so until browned.
912 2018-12-22 22:04:20 I like how instead of actually talking about the ecological damage caused by fracking and oil extraction, which you think Dems should support apparently just to spite the left, you're just doing some weird myopic hero worshipping.
913 2018-12-22 22:03:59 I was born in the oil field ain't nothing baby bout that whooping crane life.
914 2018-12-22 22:03:57 I've been trying to understand shale gas and tight oil business for a long time. Rule out stupid and you're left with psychotic or I'm missing something.

917 2018-12-22 22:03:44 I once poured a pitcher of ice water into a boiling vat of cooking oil and basically shut down an entire country club kitchen at rush hour. It’s only two points.
918 2018-12-22 22:03:29 @Toyota @ToyotaMotorCorp a quart of oil in 1200 miles . Toyota informed me that they are ok with a car using up to a quart of oil in 1200 miles . That this is regular consumption . WTH? Anytime a vehicle uses any oil this is not normal!!! I love Toyota but I think they failed me.
919 2018-12-22 22:03:25 Under a policy begun by the Obama admin.

929 2018-12-22 22:01:47 .. can it burn down / explode and pollute the waters? xD stores oil used for cars etc? maybe plain fuel?
930 2018-12-22 22:01:34 Please focus on the pipelines. That is the best way to lower world GHG emissions instead of using Saudi or Azerbaijan oil. We can be an oil superpowwr and make a positive global impact on climate change. #abpoli

937 2018-12-22 22:00:22 Police are actions are indeed not cheap. Nor are they in fact police actions. They are investments. Billions of dollars worth of reconstruction projects and oil/gas exploration is the return on investment. Only in Trump's book the ROI is not there anymore. So time to cut the loss

946 2018-12-22 21:59:44 Yes, I understand and thanks.

In current oil situation, however, I don't think there are any reliable indicators of trend. Free-fall must end first. A change in rate of change is needed at very least.

952 2018-12-22 21:58:47 Not sure why this is all surprising.  Iowa and other heartland states voted for all this.

Oil and Republicans are joined at the hip.  Never really cares about farmers or energy independent renewables.

956 2018-12-22 21:58:19 No, it's not about oil in Syria.  The interests of the war state, including its arms contractor allies in permanent war guarantees power and trillions in budgetary resources and profits. That "great game" is orders of magnitude bigger than any possible oil leases.
957 2018-12-22 21:58:16 Ok....Andrew Weaver made mention years ago. Now that he’s part of the government- nothing material. Horgan - nothing.  All their efforts seem to be against oil and gas.
958 2018-12-22 21:58:15 Finite resources? Iron, oil etc are just raw materials- they were useless to primitive man until the human MIND created value from them. The human mind is the resource.
Imagine your ilk in 2000BC being worried about finite copper ? 
We can create, substitute, adapt or go without.

966 2018-12-22 21:57:10 The policy of keeping oil in reserve for National security is outdated, but big oil wants to keep that dependency going. As you stated, there are many other alternatives to fossil fuels.

993 2018-12-22 21:52:50 Individual donors who work in an industry are not the same as corporate donations. The secretary at Goldman Sachs does not have the same interests as the CEO. As someone from TX, it's natural Beto would receive many contributions from oil industry. Sirota's article conflated
994 2018-12-22 21:52:44 We will never use all our oil, if I had my way we would be focused on nuclear research...both fission for now and fusion for the long term. Less money lost on wars...less money out the door to terrorist supporting regimes. That's how I see it anyway.
995 2018-12-22 21:52:41 Sarahmichie3 @SarahMichie3    Annointing oil.   This is getting down and dirty.   No, dont look....

997 2018-12-22 21:52:18 Bring a new car home and the first thing my grandpa does is check the oil
998 2018-12-22 21:52:04 Mate, bet you don't even know about some of the shit you had in your side before the oil money arrived
999 2018-12-22 21:51:49 There was also the little matter of Saddam the insane who tortured & murdered his people-used poison gas on his neighbors-torched oil wells in Kuwait and said-'The next time I invade Kuwait I'll have a nuclear weapon-
1000 2018-12-22 21:51:48 unless u already have amazing skin i don’t recommend this... make sure in the morn when u wash ur face to use a hydrating moisturizer (or even an oil, like hemp seed oil) to even out oil production throughout the day
1001 2018-12-22 21:51:46 Avoid regional airlines when hopping around Africa. I speak from experience. I have to travel there for work (oil &gas.) Also, don’t be surprised if airport security tries to get bribes from you. Just play along with the game. A few dollars here and there will make life easy.
1002 2018-12-22 21:51:42 I'm sniffing on lavender oil and sipping chamomile tea
1003 2018-12-22 21:51:34 Why would we need to replace it? The Trans Mountain and Energy Easy we’re both about exporting oil in addition to what’s being exported now to the US and making up that 10% of GDP that existes today. The environmental and political risks far outweigh the estimated benefits.
1004 2018-12-22 21:51:28 Who said GOAT? We all want border security, just not a stupid wall. It's 2018, what's next a moat with fiery oil.
1005 2018-12-22 21:51:26 I speak German but even before that I had never seen anyone mispronounce Euler ever. So my interpretation was that euler sounds like oil and so the Americans would to go war because of oil?!

1007 2018-12-22 21:51:06 I can never come to get an oil change without them telling me I have nails in my tires what is wrong with me
1008 2018-12-22 21:51:05 Have you ever tried CBD oil for your pain? It’s legal in the UK now. I’ve been using it for the past couple weeks and it definitely takes the edge off the pain most days (some days I’m almost pain free if I’m lucky) x
1009 2018-12-22 21:51:04 I often find that coconut oil works best if I need to be gentle and remove long-wear stuff. I just slather it on, let it sit for a moment, then gently wipe it off with cotton balls or rounds. I can't leave excess on my skin, but the amount that soaks in feels great. No dryness.
1010 2018-12-22 21:50:59 It supported it politically as you k ow perfectly well.  They wanted gaddafi out so their thieving bourgeoisie could get its hands on. Libyans oil
1011 2018-12-22 21:50:54 my grandma fried some chicken and the smell of the oil is making me sick 
1012 2018-12-22 21:50:52 That's a different protest from earlier in the day. Walked by it around 1:30pm myself. Yellow vest one was bigger (maybe 300 when I walked by it on O'Connell Bridge at 2:45ish) but was filled with crackpots. I've no interest in whatever snake oil they're selling.
1013 2018-12-22 21:50:49 It sounds like a fabricated story 
1014 2018-12-22 21:50:42 I didn’t know I was going I came with my mom to get an oil change and she was let’s go while we wait
1015 2018-12-22 21:50:37 " Harmful" in that it would prevent them from setting foot on U.S soil? 
I thought it was ineffective and useless.
1016 2018-12-22 21:50:27 It’s veggie oil and water in an emulsion, so add vinegar and vinaigrette I guess?
1017 2018-12-22 21:50:24 Have you ever worn hemp?  It’s the most comfortable. “Rick Simpson” oil removes those precancerous basal spots on skin.
1018 2018-12-22 21:50:23 Too cheap to change your oil ? Buy a Toyota these shits be driving smooth as fuck 15k miles past due 
1019 2018-12-22 21:49:55 Don't spill the oil
1020 2018-12-22 21:49:31 When it has gone so long between washings that dirt, dead skin cells & skin oil residue bond the hairs together in filthy clumps commonly referred to as “dread locks”
1021 2018-12-22 21:49:28 Tillerson was a successful CEO of an oil firm, which requires an understanding of foreign policies and leaders. Mattis is a retired General, revered by soldiers from all branches and respected by our allies and adversaries alike.
You're a mindless drone on Twitter. #Perspective
1022 2018-12-22 21:49:28 This kind uses coconut oil and potato starch as base. Idk how they get it to taste good it's like magic lol.
1023 2018-12-22 21:49:21 My granny just made me put this damn oil on my face 
1024 2018-12-22 21:49:13 The Farm Act of 2018 was signed. This legalizes Hemp farming at a federal level. This law removes Hemp derived CBD from the Controlled Substances Act. Hemp and CBD can be transported into all 50 states. Don't get ripped off! We sell Premium CBD in Oil and Water Soluble Powder!
1025 2018-12-22 21:49:08 Possibly. China and Copper are both very China centric/sensitive and both took a beating last week. I think markets whether it is equity, oil, copper or cotton are telling us that demand is going to be much lower than previously thought.

1028 2018-12-22 21:48:55 I wonder what %age of this oil price drop (started on Oct 3) was Trump squeezing MBS on Khashoggi (murdered around same time), so that he could get lower inflation at home, and stop Powell from hiking rates further #conspiracy #orjustplaingeopolitics

1030 2018-12-22 21:48:26 Not sure but I know I’m not dead yet.
1031 2018-12-22 21:48:12 Rick Simpson oil is great,  make sure you get hemp oil, not hemp seed oil.  Seeds don’t have CBD like the plant does.  You can also put a bunch of hemp in a crock pot with coconut oil and cook it at over 200 deg. but stay under 300 for over 45 min and all the CBD enters the oil
1032 2018-12-22 21:47:42 My latest right wing fight is respect for situation. You can have a load of teams on Sunday and a few games boxing day but most the 27th. So the wealth creators can get fucked on Christmas Day. This is how the oil of the economy works.

1034 2018-12-22 21:47:39 APC signature is to make promises they cannot not keep. Same way Buhari promised to do things he has no control over, e.g stabilising oil price in the international market.

Drones, cameras, sensors cheaper but without capabilities.

1037 2018-12-22 21:47:23 Quebec financially sustains itself based on Federal transfers. If it weren't for Alberta oil, where would those transfers come from? Alberta contributes a surplus higher than the surpluses of all other provinces combined. Sounds like Quebec badly needs oil, even if its indirect
1038 2018-12-22 21:47:22 @JustinTrudeau Is it possible to build a Canadian oil refinery jointly with Alberta? Instead of a another pipeline? A win win win. Or shall we continue to be hewers of timber, fish, oil ...
1039 2018-12-22 21:46:56 Depends on your skin, if you have dryer skin than definitely but if you have more oil prone skin I’d opt for some type of gentle cleansing wipes for your midday cleanup. Not too harsh but still wiping away any excess oils and dirt leaving your skin refreshed.
1040 2018-12-22 21:46:54 Not stop.
Limit.
You have a lower limit.
Use castor oil for sores.
1041 2018-12-22 21:46:53 Exactly. No matter if the PM is Trudeau or Scheer, the odds of pipelines for oil is going to be slim. Maybe focus should shift to partnering with First Nations, industry and government to refine & export finished product, if the issue is shipping raw? Adding value and jobs here.
1042 2018-12-22 21:46:29 Whatever happened to that "clean coal" you were touting in your State of the Union address?  And when is the Atlantic oil drilling going to start off the Florida coast near Mar-a-Lago?

1050 2018-12-22 21:44:38 The fact that we abandoned a large force of Saudi and Afghan soldiers who were fighting for the Americans and when Russia came along we left with all the oil and replaced half of the leaders of those counties with American pawns. After you fuck people over enough it gets old

But I agree we need to get out of there.  

If we spent  as much money on Green technology  as we did on the wars we would cripple the oil regimes. Nobody would fight for that region except  for religious nuts.
1056 2018-12-22 21:44:27 You're actually very pretty.  Avoid sulfur foods, which includes coffee.  They cause eczema when you hit your limit.  Lists of sulfur foods are on the web. Use castor oil to heal your sores.

Slice in half
Add a bit of olive oil to a wok or fry pan, medium-high heat
Cook minced garlic in olive oil for 30 seconds, then add sprouts
Add a bit more oil, then salt and pepper to taste. Toss it all together.

Cook until browned on one side. Delicious!

Remember when ISIS held large areas and cities in Syria, & had a semi tanker fleet selling oil?
So far he's right on target.

1070 2018-12-22 21:42:07 Avoid sulfur foods, which includes coffee.  List of sulfur foods on the web.  You have a limit. Castor oil makes it feel better and heal it.  You can mix it with other lotion if you want.

1079 2018-12-22 21:41:05 The strategy has always been to hold domestic oil in reserve. Buy their oil, and give them dollars to consume our finished goods.

1087 2018-12-22 21:39:57 If they had protested during Harper’s tenure we would not have a pipeline problem.

1090 2018-12-22 21:39:35 It’s easy to them, because they only pretend to care about the American tax payer. They could easily cut oil subsidies (4.6 Billion a year) and pay for the stupid wall. But Ted Cruz etc wouldn’t want to give up their state handouts..
1091 2018-12-22 21:39:17 Those 2019 “E” estimates are laughably too high. Even if everything else grows a bit, the drop in oil prices(and rise in the $) will bring S&P 500 EPS down in 2019. $150 should be base case, not $170-180.

It feels better and helps to heal it. Avoid sulfur foods, even coffee.  Lists are on the web for sulfur containing foods.  You have a limit.
1096 2018-12-22 21:38:45 Agree with the first comment. Not so much the second. I don’t see courage, devotion or leadership in anything he’s done. I see a budding snake oil salesman,  taking advantage of a tragic situation for his own benefit. He’ll make a fine politician, lawyer or media member someday.
1097 2018-12-22 21:38:14 He is an ignorant puppet who is self serving and using America for his own good while selling it to a hostile foreign ruler. @POTUS @senatemajldr @SpeakerRyan Snake oil salesmen, all of them.

You LIED!!!! You’re GUILTY!!!!
1106 2018-12-22 21:37:17 How about taking the 4.6 Billion a year in tax payer oil subsidies and using that to build the stupid wall? Why are tax payers paying oil companies..? Let’s hear it?
1107 2018-12-22 21:37:16 #OIL #OOTT #WTI

1116 2018-12-22 21:35:46 Now, if they could just make it less expensive! Hemp, with no THC in it, costs as much as regular weed! WTH? I need some for a healing oil I want to make, but at $80.00 for 7 tiny grams, I'm thinking I can live without it!
1117 2018-12-22 21:35:42 I agree. 

Which makes me wonder why it took our politicians so long to focus on getting enough oil domestically? R' & D's...I was furious at McCain when he said drilling in USA would take too long to produce results. He's been proven wrong
1118 2018-12-22 21:35:40 where does skincare twt stand on using coconut oil as makeup remover
1119 2018-12-22 21:35:33 These people honestly make me angry. My drug rep relative's best answer to "what should our friends' heavily autistic son with 1 week's supply of his meds at their pharmacist do?" was "I know it can't be easy, but maybe explore the possibilities of cannabis oil".

1121 2018-12-22 21:35:28 From behind a rusty iron portcullis, you hear a snarl. An oil lamp lies discarded nearby.
1122 2018-12-22 21:35:09 that away end at cardiff today,
something you cant buy with 
all the oil in dubai. x
1123 2018-12-22 21:34:56 .@GinaEPA like so many of generation at the helm looney birds are not responsible enough to step forward and admit to horrific mistake that is shale gas&oil extraction. Horrible horrendous vile calamity that it is.
Clean safe electricity paid for by consumption, #forkids now!

1125 2018-12-22 21:34:36 A pledge created by a Mickey Mouse environmental lobby which still allows candidates to take money from big oil, so long as the donations don’t exceed $200. Gtfo with this stupid shit. Also Bernie is no longer viable.
1126 2018-12-22 21:34:28 I'm about to have cheesy tomato rice (arborio rice, Mexican grown Romas, goat milk, sunflower oil, jalapeño, serrano, salt, WI Romano) and then I may have the last bit of cajeta ice cream (sugar, goat milk, heavy cream, Maldon sea salt). #Mylunch is Mexican-ier than yours! 
1127 2018-12-22 21:34:22 U should explore. Start off with easy stuff. When i’m in the mood for some toast (white bread is my personal preference)- spray a lil olive oil on both sides and toast it in a small frying pan. Sprinkling some cinnamon sugar and then toasting it is my alternative to cinn rolls 
1128 2018-12-22 21:34:12 Except CBD oil still illegal is South Dakota..
1129 2018-12-22 21:34:11 Surely, it would be snake oil?
1130 2018-12-22 21:34:04 Anyone out there know of chocolate and biscuits NOT containing palm oil?
1131 2018-12-22 21:34:02 Ew rancid oil
1132 2018-12-22 21:34:00 Oh remember this back and forth started because you said he KEEPS his promises ! What businesses is it helping coal, oil, banking, like they needed help ! We're all immigrants and I suppose your ok w/o the separating the children ?
1133 2018-12-22 21:33:56 Elon Musk - SNAKE OIL SALESMAN IN THE FIRST PERSON!!!
Jaguars new iPace takes the light and puts a huge shadow over this disrupters PRETEND cars.  BTW, the enviro impact of a new Tesla is worse than keeping your existing gas guzzler going for ten more years. #carbonalreadyspent
1134 2018-12-22 21:33:52 ممكن سؤال لو سمحت؟
هو اoil-free moisturizer مفيد لأصحاب البشرة الجافة؟ هو سؤال مش منطقي بس لو بشرتي dry with acne-prone ممكن يكون الزيت الموجود في المرطب العادي بيمنعها انها تكون كلير و بحس اني ف لوب من الbreakouts مبتخلصش
1135 2018-12-22 21:33:51 Oil has now lost 40% of its value in barely two months.  Gas prices should be plummeting also.
1136 2018-12-22 21:33:41 Also known as snake oil, just like the salesperson.
1137 2018-12-22 21:33:37 Well oil is made here .. it shouldn't be 2.50 
1138 2018-12-22 21:33:36 The military rarely does anything without a plan. If they pull out quickly, there’s a high probability that things will destabilize and we will need to go back in a few years. There’s always oil for future war skids
1139 2018-12-22 21:33:34 Invest in Solar, Hydro n wind Power not in Sadi Arabia Oil
1140 2018-12-22 21:33:32 I didn't mention AB. That's total jobs according to stats can.  O&G employs about as many people as fisheries, but fisheries gets millions, not billions.

My point is that you can't understand QC mindset. We have other industries, predate oil, non-anglo, non-germanic.
1141 2018-12-22 21:33:30 So getting an oil change, used one of those motorized scooters to get around while waiting for my car. Brilliant concept and idea but def not meant for being on certain roads. My bloody brain is still rattling around my skull post ride. Fun tho 
1142 2018-12-22 21:33:20 finally getting my oil changed after saying I would for 2 weeks!!! productivity!!!
1143 2018-12-22 21:33:11 U will go down till u discover oil
1144 2018-12-22 21:33:03 kanada, emptied of its minerals and dirty oil. emptied of its trees and water. a crippled thing, drowning in a puddle, covered in ants. the ocean doesn’t give a shit because it knows it’s dying too.
1145 2018-12-22 21:32:50 Drink castor oil
1146 2018-12-22 21:32:49 Turkey doesn't care about  ISIS. They want to wipe out the Kurds that are fighting against ISIS.  Trump Is handing the Mideast to Russia and Iran. They will control most of the worlds oil supply. How can that be good for national security? Our planes and tanks run on fuel.
1147 2018-12-22 21:32:32 I love the raw dough representing him not burning in oil lmao
1148 2018-12-22 21:32:28 Why are there so few articles in the press questioning why the US is in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc.. in the first place? Trillions spent, american lives lost, for what? Oil? Safety? What is the point? We could have put solar panels on every house in the US for the money spent.
1149 2018-12-22 21:32:27 CANADIANS AGREE, we are proud of our country and all it's natural resources, there is one thing we are ashamed of,  it's TRUDEAU, not the oil sands.
1150 2018-12-22 21:32:23 Shea butter is good with castor oil, there is night one i get from Sephora (let me find the link), also lip scrubs like 2 times a week makes a huge difference.
1151 2018-12-22 21:32:21 The price of oil is down and air fares and cruising fares are down. Big SUVs are more popular. Travel and tourism is booming. Pollution will continue upwards.

1153 2018-12-22 21:32:05 No all talk....Russia just wants oil in Syria...Just talk....
1154 2018-12-22 21:31:40 We should build a pipeline to efficiently move all the snow and then come summer just pump oil through it since we already have the infrastructure
1155 2018-12-22 21:31:38 Hair cut and oil change outta the way.  Time to finish up the rest of this XMas shopping...
1156 2018-12-22 21:31:26 Curious... mayonnaise in a sweet cooked dish?  That's a new one on me. I wouldn't because in Australia at least mayonnaise has vinegar in it.   I'd have gone for butter or a small amount of coconut oil. Let us know how it turns out
1157 2018-12-22 21:31:24 Dermatologist: use oil free make up if not at all 
Me: *uses red lipstick to blush and brown lipstick as bronzer*
1158 2018-12-22 21:31:20 Bake ur buds on a baking on at 150 to activate for a little, and then slow cook the buds in coconut oil for 6 hrs

Then strain with cheese cloth and back with the oil 

Have fun
1159 2018-12-22 21:31:18 Coconut oil. Drink more water. Put Vaseline on them at night to keep the moisture in. Camomile and calendula have properties that can help with this too.
1160 2018-12-22 21:31:15 We really don’t need oil.  We have enormous oil deposits right here in the US.
1161 2018-12-22 21:31:15 I am all ready for Santa, the hardwood floors have been scrubbed with Murphys Oil!
1162 2018-12-22 21:31:14 Oil of Olay?
1163 2018-12-22 21:31:11 We have to stop with the dirty oil and fracking
1164 2018-12-22 21:30:47 Greg doesn't use much oil when he does use it, so, no worries, there.
1165 2018-12-22 21:30:47 I took my car to the dealership to get the oil changed and they charged me 200 dollars. Merry Christmas.
1166 2018-12-22 21:30:46 My issue with Alberta, where I lived for 30 yrs beginning just before the first calamitous oil price collapse, was turning their backs on Canada when it suited them after the insane monies came flooding in. They bought the multinational spin on transportation and refining.
1167 2018-12-22 21:30:43 Been there. Reading quiet stories and cuddling, singing softly, rocking, tickle-scratching their backs, a drop of lavander oil on the corner of their blankie... anything so they can drift off to sleep b/c I'm not getting out of there until they do. Often I fall asleep first :)
1168 2018-12-22 21:30:32 @EmmaHardieUK facial oil is incredible - my pregnant hormonal skin is literally glowing 
1169 2018-12-22 21:30:21 He inclines his head. "So it is a wise decision. But your misery is something that tugs at the heartstrings." Unlike the doctor, this drow has blue eyes, the irises clear against the white sclera. "I also have a scented oil, to rest on skin or clothes, which will help you."
1170 2018-12-22 21:30:18 Yep, not all fries.  I have only found two places that use separate meat free deep fryers and vegetarian safe oil.
1171 2018-12-22 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1172 2018-12-22 21:30:08 Heavy Dying i just did so much things and spent So Many Money but now all of my adult errands are done i have NEW OIL
1173 2018-12-22 21:30:07 HE LOST THE PIPE LINE ACCESS ROUTE. Ohh Sorry ya all did not know what the war was about ? Mr French and the entire corrupt Previous administration do. "OIL"

How do u leftists feel now. You are supporting an OIL WAR ?
1174 2018-12-22 21:29:54 @angry_ustaaz
1175 2018-12-22 21:29:46 Why are low oil prices a good thing for people in a State that makes quite a bit of money when oil is high?
1176 2018-12-22 21:29:45 Girl put you a spoon in the freezer and then put it to your neck for a few minutes like 4 times a day and then massage some tea tree oil into it
1177 2018-12-22 21:29:35 Are they hand crafting the oil??
1178 2018-12-22 21:29:21 A snake oil fails man
1179 2018-12-22 21:29:19 Yea, stick it to those GOPers
You are aware I know " border security" is an integrated system that includes walls, fencing now, that work. Fact, substandard design keeps us spending more repairing, but NOBODY suggests taking it down. They know its needed
1180 2018-12-22 21:29:14 Get ready for the DC geniuses who bought Paul Ryan’s snake oil to be blown away by Sasse’s earnest thoughtfulness.
1181 2018-12-22 21:29:08 If those people  oil and gas so much, why do they want to send it away?
1182 2018-12-22 21:29:07 Dear family please put everything back in the cupboard securely, the last thing I wanted on my first night back was to be drenched by a bottle of sunflower oil

1184 2018-12-22 21:29:01 new #massagerooms scene  just dropped with @AlyssaReeceXo #oil
1185 2018-12-22 21:29:01 Can you find the pattern?
 
At Interior: Unethical Ryan Zinke Out. Oil Lobbyist In.

At EPA: Unethical Scott Pruitt Out. Coal Lobbyist In.

At HHS: Unethical Tom Price Out. Pharma Executive In.
 
In the Trump swamp, things are so bad they turn to lobbyists to cure ethical lapses.
1186 2018-12-22 21:28:57 How were consumers hurt? The refineries were making windfall profits and not passing it along to consumers. “Big oil” are the ones that complained about what Notley did. It was small oil that appreciated it. The resources belong to Albertans, not the oil companies.
1187 2018-12-22 21:28:55 puta que pariu,é shatter oil???
1188 2018-12-22 21:28:36 Also, if Quebec is so amazing and doesn't want Alberta's oil, they should also cancel their shipments of Saudi oil and get @Bombardier to build them a million electric cars, but hopefully not with taxpayers' money, like all their other projects.
1189 2018-12-22 21:28:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1190 2018-12-22 21:28:28 Why does she look like she’s covered in vegetable oil, you need to mess with that skin shader lol
1191 2018-12-22 21:28:21 I use a full spectrum CBD oil by mouth daily.Nightly I use a THC vape pen.Problem is CBD is 125$ a month and THC is 75$ a month.I get the CBD online but have to get the THC cartridge from a friend.I only take a few "hits" of the THC at bedtime as I don't like the "stoned" feeling

1194 2018-12-22 21:27:41 Remember how good it felt to see our way out from under the oppression of a 40 yr Conservative gov't that let so much slide under the guise of prosparity. The NDP came in full of hopeful ideas...and the big fire happened and the oil industry took a big hit.We have come a long way
1195 2018-12-22 21:27:38 #OIL #OOTT #WTI 
For WTI day trading, the focus should be on the patterns and market behaviors, not barrels counting unless you have a father like #Trump. Even for swing traders, it's a big question as to how you can translate the number crunched into live WTI trading.
1196 2018-12-22 21:27:38 Bigtime na pamasko, oil price rollback umarangkada na; P1 sa kada litro ng gasolina, diesel at kerosene #RapidoHatawBalita #DZRHNationwide
1197 2018-12-22 21:27:16 Business model does not include making money from producing oil. 
It’s about getting money from others to “prove” reserves then sell to next greater fool.
Perfectly reasonable business model but not what most think.
1198 2018-12-22 21:27:16 No, even the gov’t of Alberta is saying 1 oil tanker / day in their @KeepCanWorking spots. In 2017 only 1.7M tones of oil was exported all year according to Port of Vancouver stats and an Aframax oil tanker carries 650 009 barrels. It’s a massive increase in oil shipments.
1199 2018-12-22 21:27:01 Tomorrow: Make sauce & lasagna, olive oil cake, meatballs, millionaire shortbread, spice cookies, cheesecake, egg nog cookies. Monday: Clean & start the celebrations!
1200 2018-12-22 21:26:51 Day 1 of CBD oil and for the first time in months, I don't feel like my chest is being crushed by a thousand bricks. I can't even express the relief.

Starbucks Cinnamon Dolce k-cup, 2 packs Stevia, 3 tbsp MCT oil, 1 scoop collagen powder, 2 tbsp Kerrygold butter, 1 tbsp heavy whipping cream. So delicious & burns fat while drinking!
1204 2018-12-22 21:26:35 Imagine the Nigeria economy when crude oil becomes obsolete.

1213 2018-12-22 21:25:49 Just remember lots of sex and olive oil runs on your opening will prevent tears... have to keep active
1214 2018-12-22 21:25:27 @GiniaNYT Regarding your column on cashless stores & restaurants. Banks have gotten laws passed to forbid stores charging different prices for cash and credit. Only gas stations can -- perhaps oil companies are the only ones with more lobbying $$ than banks!
1215 2018-12-22 21:25:26 Unusually stable because of the plummeting oil prices.

1219 2018-12-22 21:24:18 Find the coolant leak. 

Check your coolant level. Level normal? Any oil in the coolant? 

Drain oil in a drain pan and see what it looks like. If the oil is cloudy you have coolant in the oil. 

The oil usage and coolant leak don’t have to be related either.
1220 2018-12-22 21:24:17 The oil and gas industry effects economies all over. Even Toronto, or yourself in PEI. How much of Toronto's economy is dependent on O&G?

1225 2018-12-22 21:24:05 That would make sense to me, there’s no evolutionary reason that a plant would include cannabinoids in its seeds right? But that research article clearly states products being sold as hemp seed oil contain cannabinoids.
1226 2018-12-22 21:24:04 Tell Nigerians what you did with oil money for 16 years – Osinbajo tells PDP
1227 2018-12-22 21:23:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
1228 2018-12-22 21:23:55 Had a cousin in the machining for the oil companies,  got laid off & one day a job come up and within one hr 1500 applications went in for the position so when Trudeau paints a rosie picture its not what he imagines in his small world of personal days off but still gets paidbig$.
1229 2018-12-22 21:23:52 They Droped Oil price from $75 down to $45 for the reason they know only))))...watch Oil price at $365 in a few months
1230 2018-12-22 21:23:41 Imo oil is up to bat now being used as diplomatic tool to reign in Putin get him to leave Syria also and back off Ukraine give ships ppl back etc. 

This is all just my conjecture but I have seen a plethora of evidence to support it.
1231 2018-12-22 21:23:24 Hanging out in the McDonald’s Walmart while waiting on a oil change is the worst experience

About 2 months ago, #Croft even suggested her clients got ready for a $100 a barrel oil due to the possible conflict between the #US and #Iran. Her team's study of oil prices was sub-par at best. I would think they couldn't read WTI charts at all.
1241 2018-12-22 21:22:04 I'm assuming Iceland will now stop banking with HSBC, who finance palm oil extraction, and the CEO will cease his donations to the Tories. Still, it's a start.

1247 2018-12-22 21:21:46 Martina made me drive her all the way to Devils Lake to get an oil change and they’re closed 
1248 2018-12-22 21:21:39 Yeah, a full defrost is key, oh and not over filling the pot. A turkey will displays a little bit of oil.

1250 2018-12-22 21:21:32 I worked for a company that repaired oil refineries. I ordered all the parts. Nothing was ordered from China. Not even nuts and bolts.
1251 2018-12-22 21:21:25 There is a truck rally in support of the oil and gas industry going on in Edson AB right now. #EdsonStrong So proud...

1256 2018-12-22 21:20:36 Dude same hello fish oil
1257 2018-12-22 21:20:32 That’s a lot of oil.
1258 2018-12-22 21:20:19 Pence (all-purpose liar + climate denier) is bought by the Koch brothers and the Russian-paid NRA, to enable fossil fuel profiteering + oil&gas route racketeering. 

Pence's brother was head honcho for Cummins engines in Moscow, & his longtime pal is bloody mercenary Erik Prince!
1259 2018-12-22 21:20:11 lil bit of Oil in a pan cut some little slits in a garlic and put them over fire.. after the garlic and oil warm asf soak it up w a cotton ball and put that shit in yo ear let it sit for as long as it takes for the pain to go away
1260 2018-12-22 21:19:58 just used peppermint essential oil to cleanse behind my ears bc I was still stinky getting out of the shower and let me tell you! Amazing!
1261 2018-12-22 21:19:40 i just got introduced to the sous vide a couple months ago! Also, try using grapeseed oil to sear! the smoke point is higher! i think you'll really like it!
1262 2018-12-22 21:19:18 I don’t think my dad hates anything more than olive oil stores
1263 2018-12-22 21:19:17 i was gonna say that it kind of looks foccacia-like, with all the oil and stuff. hope it turns out good!
1264 2018-12-22 21:19:13 No one that wears a Fur collar is an environmentalist, and visits Putin (the largest oil baron)in the middle of a election campaign, she somehow took the exact amount of votes away Lock her up!
1265 2018-12-22 21:19:08 @palmersworks I've been having a very difficult time finding your Skin Therapy Cleansing Oil Face in any stores near me. Are you doing away with it and if so what do you have to replace it with? It's the only product that truly gets makeup off cleanly!
1266 2018-12-22 21:19:05 Has anyone tried cbd oil, & have there been any side effects from it?

Effective tips for wt. loss:

Healthy diet:

Low carb, high protein, moderate-high fats.

No processed foods, bread, pizza, rice, pasta, oats, added sugar (brown ain't healthy, it's just sugar), vegetable oil, legumes if they upset your stomach.

1275 2018-12-22 21:17:33 #OIL #OOTT #WTI 
Unless barrels counting is the only way you know for WTI trading, don't do it. The incompetent oil pundits had real-time data of supply and demand worldwide still made fatal predictions of $100+ a barrel oil back in the summer. Can you crunch the number better?
1276 2018-12-22 21:17:31 Oil change places always trynna finesse. Bitch give me what I asked or move so I can pull off. Tf.
1277 2018-12-22 21:17:19 I suspect most people don't even know they consume palm oil since they don't bother reading ingredients lists.
1278 2018-12-22 21:17:17 Exactly. After they’ve all killed each other, we’ll go in and get the oil.  Trump is right !
1279 2018-12-22 21:17:09 Welp, THE LUCK: car battery dies while car is idling in line for an oil change! Plus the oil change place doesn’t stock or install batteries, natch!

Today has probably turned into an EXPENSIVE ADVENTURE, GAHHH
1280 2018-12-22 21:17:08 Mr. Man go and answer your oil subsidy and NYSC scandal.
1281 2018-12-22 21:16:58 The Trudeau government killed 3 pipelines which would have got the oil to tidewater! So don't give me the crap it was Harper's fault, you sound like Trudeau whining about everything being because of Harper! He's been in 3 years and fucked everything he touches! He's a useless tit
1282 2018-12-22 21:16:57 I take cbd oil for my anxiety it's supposed to be mint chocolate flavored but it tastes so bad
1283 2018-12-22 21:16:56 which btw vaccines taste the way motor oil smells
1284 2018-12-22 21:16:49 Leave dem make dem dey find who to deceive. We can never forget how they set this country backwards, especially when crude oil prices were highest!
1285 2018-12-22 21:16:33 bro i just remembered a day when we were learning to use oil paints, and i never used them before so i left the room to get a cup of water for the paint and i was wondering y no one else got up for water and they just looked at me like,.. what is she doing, i felt so stupid 
1286 2018-12-22 21:16:27 Got an essential oil diffuser it's amazing 
1287 2018-12-22 21:16:25 In short, I'd look for signs of obvious leaks (I'd start with the oil cooler) or cross-contamination – if none then I'd wipe that off, check the level cold, refill, start it cold and see what comes out the back and go from there.
1288 2018-12-22 21:16:22 Accessory

Blue lagoon,
in the dew hours.
Glare of your eyes,
at the sunrise -
your palm,
takes me 
by surprise...
Humid drip
from palm leaves,
coconut oil
dries with the breeze.
Your bronze 
and golden
Goddess-like skin,
makes me lose touch 
with my kin.
1289 2018-12-22 21:16:12 Further hypocrisy. Victoria pumps an average of 82 million litres of raw sewage daily into waters just off Victoria’s harbour. It is pumped into your pristine ocean through two one-meter wide pipes 60 and 65 meters under the surface by twin 1000 horsepower motors. AB dirty oil?
1290 2018-12-22 21:16:08 oil exec & military general = the swamp??

Trumpism is confusing.
1291 2018-12-22 21:16:06 Name one mega project coming online. Without shale, oil prices would be topped out and demand destruction would be underway. You're in a tiny minority opinion with your views on this. Don't bet against shale cos when oil rises.
1292 2018-12-22 21:15:47 @FuhrMP what about helping Rachel Notley fund some new upgraders in Alberta. It would make it easier & safer to transport their oil not to mention getting them a better price higher royalties for the government & create some much need jobs.
1293 2018-12-22 21:15:41 Coconut oil on the skin
1294 2018-12-22 21:15:36 Sean’s friend who is a chef gifted me truffle oil and I got goosebumps. This is the holidays guys.
1295 2018-12-22 21:15:36 I put a drop of peppermint oil on my chapstick for the holidays and lemme just tell you that my lips are living their best life
1296 2018-12-22 21:15:34 Do love a bit of Rambo,the only special forces soldier that hides under every light bulb going and is covered in baby oil
1297 2018-12-22 21:15:31 The fat drippings are much tastier than regular oil. Still very simple, and eliminates the need to heat oil, if you use the drippings as soon as the roast comes out of the oven.
1298 2018-12-22 21:15:22 mom says coconut oil helps your hair grow faster ?? is this true bc we were looking for some but cant find it .
1299 2018-12-22 21:15:19 That's awfully judgemental.  You still won't admit your wrong so I'm not sure who the narcissist is.  I did admit they would not use strictly Alberta oil. Not sure what political side I'm on has to do with it.
1300 2018-12-22 21:15:03 Another common failure is the air/oil separator, which can lead to excessive oil consumption; they may not be seeing the smoke, or look to see if the tailpipes are excessively dirty. Oil level sensors can play games, too; best checked when stone cold on a level.
1301 2018-12-22 21:14:52 I wonder if Donald has done a deal with Erdogan if they tone down criticism of MBS over Kashoggi and perhaps additionally with ongoing deal over oil from Kurdistan?
Something has certainly changed.

1303 2018-12-22 21:14:45 To win Narusegawa's pancakes, Keitaro must eat 21 dimes covered in olive oil
1304 2018-12-22 21:14:36 and if Members of Daesh were hosted by certain factions of Kurdish Forces, if members of Daesh were able to ship oil through Kurdish Territory with the blessing of Masour Barzanji the KRG leader,

1306 2018-12-22 21:14:21 So when XOP shoots right back up with oil you're going to be scratching your head clinging to this theory they cannot attract capital. It will come back just as fast as it left. That's what traders do. Hedge funds are buying DVN.
1307 2018-12-22 21:14:17 しよしよ〜！
1308 2018-12-22 21:14:12 Try cannabis oil
1309 2018-12-22 21:14:11 Mayonnaise in the oil cap generally means head gasket......oil & water don't mix well.
1310 2018-12-22 21:14:04 Wish every person against oil could have volunteered passing out hampers to humble people who have no option but to apply for one. Their kids who’ll get the basics & no frills! Proud of their employers today standing up for them in the truck convoy!!
1311 2018-12-22 21:13:54 Further Quebec hypocrisy. The St. Lawrence is the outflow for all of the Great Lakes, holds 20 per cent of the world’s fresh water. Roughly 45 million people depend on it for drinking water. But it still OK to pump raw sewage into it. No to a maybe oil spill though? Ridiculous.
1312 2018-12-22 21:13:41 Sure I’ll have a little bread with my dipping oil. And a smidge of pasta with my wine.
1313 2018-12-22 21:13:40 Managed to sneak in for an oil change and tire rotation today. I was about 600 over, so that was definitely necessary
1314 2018-12-22 21:13:38 Continue to be impressed how the oil and gas employees show their passion and power!
1315 2018-12-22 21:13:35 Baloney, Trudeau doing what he can. The crap coming from UCP, CPC is manipulation of hyperbole to sucjer people too busy or not informed to check facts.  Need a boogeyman to blame instead of decades of wasting oil revenues.
1316 2018-12-22 21:13:20 Vitalite is probably the best around. Why doesn't she consider it? Alternatively a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil on homemade sourdough bread is delicious. A great mayo is Veganaise (Sainsburys stock it).
1317 2018-12-22 21:13:16 The fact you can't seem to grasp is Trump gave out Iranian oil waivers and hurt everyone drilling for oil. They needed those barrels off the market. They spent money to prepare for Nov 5th and Trump screwed them all. Everyone agrees with me on this except you.
1318 2018-12-22 21:13:12 Fuckkkkkkk!!! Better fill the fridge! Spend £500 on a "big shop" , fill the cars with fuel, chop wood, fill the heating oil, because everybody and everything shuts down over #Christmas .. For one fucking day.
1319 2018-12-22 21:13:07 It's got nothing to do with a superior intellect my friend, you just demonstrably don't know what you're talking about.

I never said that Venezuela's economy was non existent, I said that it's tied to oil, so how could Labour copy their model, even if they wanted to?
1320 2018-12-22 21:12:44 Just finished a most delightful playtime with my newest boy toy #coconut oil #bdsm #mistress in #STL
1321 2018-12-22 21:12:27 I’ve pictured her on a beach with her kids for Christmas. Alex rubbing on the Sun oil...
1322 2018-12-22 21:12:20 Take a dollar off that $1.86 and it would be 1986 ..... Merry Christmas from the oil companies
1323 2018-12-22 21:12:08 Question 2.

I'm FULL..my leptin is up and my ghrelin down

So why do I want to finish the crispy shredded chicken, that deep fried lovely sweet and sour yummy oh my...

I really don't think that desire comes from see oil 

at 2am I'll be woke up by ghrelin and go back 2 sleep
1324 2018-12-22 21:12:04 I love seeing darkskin women get their praise but damn they gotta look like the number 8 and be covered in baby oil for yall to acknowledge them for half a second
1325 2018-12-22 21:12:02 Try to fry bread and palm oil....tnk me later
1326 2018-12-22 21:11:53 Think about what it was before 2013 when oil was at this price. Production/delivery costs account for at least $1 per gallon increase
1327 2018-12-22 21:11:51 The oil issue goes much further than combustion engines. 

Plastic is everywhere. In our clothes, packaging our groceries, in our tools and kitchen ware.

Plastic is everywhere.
1328 2018-12-22 21:11:50 No harm in changing oil regularly otherwise hanzi "dzingazoshisha"...... Ndokutaurawo kwevamwe.
1329 2018-12-22 21:11:47 After delivery, I started facing massive hair fall. Hair fall is a normal concern post natal. But I would like to thank the onion oil as it helped my hair fall to stop and made my hair look healthier. Thanks Rey Naturals..
1330 2018-12-22 21:11:34 I almost totally lost the plot in Frome Lidl when, as a last straw, I couldn’t find any truffle oil and I realised would probably have to make the journey to Waitrose in Wells too. Maybe there’s the beginning of a support group here?
1331 2018-12-22 21:11:28 so like I lost my charger and I ordered a new and now I feel like it was a waste because I'm damn near out of oil
1332 2018-12-22 21:11:28 Could be multiple bad valve seals. Would puff smoke on takeoffs from a stop but might not see much smoke during highway speeds. Would still eat through a lot of oil. A head gasket that bad would surely be putting out smoke on the highway and overheat.
1333 2018-12-22 21:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: burning crust with greasy coconut oil and shrimp.
1334 2018-12-22 21:10:55 Nothing quite beats the simple joy of a baguette dipped in Olive oil and balsamic vinegar, though I did goof and grab balsamic concentrate which is... intense
1335 2018-12-22 21:10:44 @BossTruckShops 

$227 to provide only the labor & grease to service my Volvo VNL430. I have the oil/fuel filters and the oil. I’ve used your Tulsa store for this many times. As well as multiple sets of tires, wheel seals, pinion seals, flat repairs, etc.  Never again.
1336 2018-12-22 21:10:35 Tahir looks really young must use oil of Ulay
1337 2018-12-22 21:10:26 ウルフはクッパ意外にしんどいです
1338 2018-12-22 21:10:17 The 2019 Appropriation Bill presented by Buhari to the @NGRSenate is a national embarrassment. For a start, the Budget Office and the FEC got all indices and forecasts wrong, especially oil output and price proportion.
1339 2018-12-22 21:10:15 I used ro call him oil of olay coz he has such a young wee face 
1340 2018-12-22 21:10:13 Oil Changed, car washed and now some breakfast. T-bone steak & eggs – bij IHOP
1341 2018-12-22 21:10:11 また通話とかしよな！！
1342 2018-12-22 21:10:11 Since oil carts became a huge deal I'm noticing a lot more strangers out and about are stoned
1343 2018-12-22 21:10:03 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
1344 2018-12-22 21:10:02 I am definitely out-classed here. I'd have to look up "sous vide." I use olive oil in the skillet and then let the fat in the steak do the rest as it melts. If I were cooking for two I'd probably be more inventive, adding some garlic and red wine as a sauce.
1345 2018-12-22 21:10:00 + Tea Tree Oil
1346 2018-12-22 21:10:00 Olive oil and grapeseed oil have antioxidants that will help remove lotion. It will also help prevent breakouts.
1347 2018-12-22 21:09:54 嬉しい〜〜！！
1348 2018-12-22 21:09:40 Aren’t they doing it for like the same but opposite reasons we are :L They hate our culture, so they blow our shit up. We hate their culture, so we blow their shit up.
Also oil.
But y’know.
So maybe we should all just get Teslas and stay home.
1349 2018-12-22 21:09:31 moving on from using castor oil in my hair to using coconut oil, wish me luck 
1350 2018-12-22 21:09:14 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1351 2018-12-22 21:09:07 Agree it’s a buy, but recently many stocks have fallen sharply (URG, DNN to say a couple of examples in the U space I follow, without mentioning other sectors like oil&gas...) so it’s hard to decide where to add some of our very scarce capital!
1352 2018-12-22 21:09:00 Perhaps Harvard will teach this young student that “y’all” is not really a word... especially for a well-educated individual. @JesseKellyDC
1353 2018-12-22 21:08:57 Oil? 
1354 2018-12-22 21:08:39 or supporting them in prison, they are not making remittances to Mexico. Mexico must pay to jail their own criminals. Remittances are one of Mexico's top sources of foreign income, outpacing oil exports, which totaled $18.5 billion between January and October.
1355 2018-12-22 21:08:27 And let's not forget Quebecs hypocrisy. The St. Lawrence is the outflow for all of the Great Lakes, holds 20 per cent of the world’s fresh water. Roughly 45 million people depend on it for drinking water. But it still OK to pump raw sewage into it. No to a maybe oil spill though?
1356 2018-12-22 21:08:05 I used to want video games and Nerf guns for Christmas. Now I want a free oil change and some jeans.
1357 2018-12-22 21:07:56 Need to get a oil change soon but there isn’t enough time in the day
1358 2018-12-22 21:07:55 When you've got @RandPaul  and @SenMajLdr  representing the State of Kentucky, the snake oil scenario originated long before #BubbaTrump stole the election.

Your statement is spot on!
1359 2018-12-22 21:07:51 はぁ〜ほんと癒し、推しだわ
1360 2018-12-22 21:07:51 Rubs tummy n offers peppermint tea (peppermint oil is supposed up help)
1361 2018-12-22 21:07:48 If anyone is interested in saving money on an oil change... don’t ever go to Jiffy Lube. They just charged me $100 for a $60 oil change. Never again
1362 2018-12-22 21:07:47 You lost the popular vote by 3 million. In contrast Barack Obama’s 2008 election victory gave him 10 million more votes than his opponent. Hardly the greatest of all time on your part you bloviated snake oil salesman
1363 2018-12-22 21:07:42 But Palm Oil is so tasty! Was a lovely lass that once gave me a palm oil massage
1364 2018-12-22 21:07:39 The US never supported ISIS, we supported rebels who were in bed with Al-Qaeda.  The Russians, Turks and Saudis supported ISIS with money, markets for pilfered oil, border entry ways and Chechen commanders.
1365 2018-12-22 21:07:35 Big Oil and Big Auto surely have a hand in how the US shaped transportation the past 70 years or so.
1366 2018-12-22 21:07:35 can i be next for the whole "getting married to and then killed by you" thing?

i'm not an oil tycoon or have any money but i'd just really dig both of those things
1367 2018-12-22 21:07:22 like Vick’s it helps open up your chest. Or you could use essential oil in a hot towel and place it on your face.
1368 2018-12-22 21:07:13 My dad bought 60$ CBD oil for my aging dog lol
1369 2018-12-22 21:07:08 I love oil
1370 2018-12-22 21:07:03 Man - I don't want to waste my time on you. Sorry - but the pissed me off. Look at Oil and AUDUSD - and then do the math yourself. Please un-follow or I will help you!
1371 2018-12-22 21:07:02 "And now here's Nigel Lawson to tell us why humans have got nothing to do with it and it's all just a natural cycle" BBC News (sponsored by the oil industry)
1372 2018-12-22 21:06:56 I've heard a rumour that you have to pay extra for your ads every time someone responds to them.  Always happy to let the big oil companies funding you pay a bit extra.
1373 2018-12-22 21:06:54 They aren’t out of touch they simply don’t give a rats ass about the middle class. Their attention has always been on big money donors & big oil. #sad
1374 2018-12-22 21:06:50 Your snake oil isn't selling as well as it used to, is it?.  Clock is ticking!  Be sure to say "Hi" to Speaker @NancyPelosi at Noon on January 3rd!!
1375 2018-12-22 21:06:42 There are 6 tbsp of olive oil in that recipe
1376 2018-12-22 21:06:32 んはぁ〜〜！！
1377 2018-12-22 21:06:28 What a crock of B.S. here's an idea for fairness: Stop giving oil and gas corporations massive tax breaks for raping western North Dakota?
1378 2018-12-22 21:06:28 Finally got an oil change and my eyebrows done 
1379 2018-12-22 21:06:24 Have u tried bud oil for the seizures
1380 2018-12-22 21:06:02 There's no better way to be! I always give my husband crap for going onto Before It's News lol cuz it's full of snake oil salespeople but it is how we learned of Q last fall. Sometimes you get a gem or 2, but it's like they say, be careful who you follow. Discernment wins!
1381 2018-12-22 21:05:59 It is vehicle tax exempt in Germany, taxed only half as much on income taxes for company cars that can be used for private trips. It needs less maintenance and costs far less to „fuel“ and brakes last longer. It doesn’t need oil changes. That’s a lot of money you don’t spend.
1382 2018-12-22 21:05:45 Wash your face with tea tree oil, it’s in the body shop and you can get the toner too.
If you couldn’t find it, wash your face with La Roche-Posay, it’s in el ezaby.
And if you get any pimples put TriAcnéal on it, it goes away and it doesn’t oil up more.
1383 2018-12-22 21:05:35 I am thankful for the opportunity to make a cozy Christmas setting for my family and friends. So excited to see  you all! 

PS Thank you Hempworx for the CBD oil that keeps me pain free throughout my favorite season of the year. So many blessings this year...so many...
1384 2018-12-22 21:05:31 Think about every hundred hours you change the oil in those hubs or bearings whatever you call them. On a Ford Trac machine your give enough about 80 horsepower compared to a 2 track just to spin the tracks

1386 2018-12-22 21:04:54 There's nothing that makes a Sunday more that the mixture of cow shit and hydraulic oil.
1387 2018-12-22 21:04:48 Only if they have oil
1388 2018-12-22 21:04:45 Gotta get on the baby oil bandwagon. Best post lobster bath skin cure.
1389 2018-12-22 21:04:38 It’s true! Like an undiscovered oil field
1390 2018-12-22 21:04:37  lol ... i told you to buy olive oil it helps

1394 2018-12-22 21:04:16 Since I've been diffusing thieves essential oil for a week straight my room smells like cinnamon all the time

1396 2018-12-22 21:04:07 wash days two days two days a week, protein conditioners at least once a week, hot oil treatment atleast once a month, detangle then to style to style,  a strengthening and conditioning leave in followed by a curl activator cream. i get it trimmed every 3 months. only wash n goes

Call to spend more to process and admit millions who use those very same services, compete for housing/ jobs, being non net positive tax payers is a good idea? Jobs Americans wont do, 20 -30 million?
1400 2018-12-22 21:03:48 Keep Yorkshire puds simple! One mug of eggs. One mug of milk. One mug of flour. Mix. Table spoon of oil in a muffin tin x8. Heat the oil in a hot oven and then pour in the batter and cook till risen. So simple. No need to complicate it.
1401 2018-12-22 21:03:33 そんなの分かんないよ！
1402 2018-12-22 21:03:19 All I’m saying is yersterday I was buying Christmas presents and got an oil change and got a new tire and everything and today I wake up and someone has stole over 200$ and I broke my axel on my car a few mins ago
1403 2018-12-22 21:03:19 Two-Face cleaned the .22s quietly with some fresh gun oil. Helped him think. He used to do this in their basement, back when @MrsGDent and himself were together, and also on their getaways...

He lowered the gun gently. Could it be? "What is this?" he whispered to himself. -
1404 2018-12-22 21:03:15 #AskMamrie Assuming your short term memories are all fast asleep on multicolored inflatable swans in a shallow lake of cherry snapz, what fragrance/essential oil scent brings a fond memory back instantaneously ?
1405 2018-12-22 21:03:14 Does McKenna even realize that we are already taxed on energy!? GST, and provincial whatever.  Now trying to sell the snake oil carbon tax guilt trip over and above the already tax. We are clean, and we need to heat our houses without getting robbed. Stop the deception.
1406 2018-12-22 21:03:05 In 2019 we’re no longer getting any old bread. Let’s get this rosemary, sundried tomato and olive oil focaccia
1407 2018-12-22 21:03:02 It's complicated. No doubt about it. But think about this. ~ 80% of GHGs are created by end users - us. We buy oil, gas, we eat meat, we fly in jets, etc. And we use every excuse to avoid making uncomfortable change. We'd rather repeat BS arguments and go on emitting CO2.
1408 2018-12-22 21:03:00 Leakage rates for supply/demand-side actions on tar sands are roughly equal.

So stopping KXL doesn’t mean that oil all comes from elsewhere. It means it doesn’t get extracted/burnt at all.

This isn’t a pure substitution game. It’s keeping FF in the ground & preventing lock-in.

1414 2018-12-22 21:01:42 True it’s not complete protein.  But they  are high in glycine.  And most keto and carnivore folks eat mostly muscle meats so it can help balance that ratio.  Yes, everything seems to have a lot of omega 6’s.  Maybe we should start a company cooking our rinds in coconut oil. 
1415 2018-12-22 21:01:38 When you get a new windshield and an oil change for Christmas .... and you’re excited about it .... 
1416 2018-12-22 21:01:30 hmm i see why they might've done it but sarol da tel (mustard oil) and coconut oil have been used in punjab for ages. maybe only the rich could afford it or something? back in the day, jatt used to be a less rich caste than the rest
1417 2018-12-22 21:01:23 @Tesla @elonmusk we need the Tesla tuk tuk but no money in that though . crude oil wholesale price dropped sharply but not being passed onto consumer at the pumps by cartels very few options for the majority of the population to go carbon free  @CMAgovUK

1421 2018-12-22 21:01:10 I am very high maintenance in that I require two to three oil changes a week now or else I will fall apart.
1422 2018-12-22 21:00:46 Research shows that using about 45 g of fish oil per day for 6 months can be helpful for lowering inflammation.
1423 2018-12-22 21:00:44 The only thing we really need to cut out is  processed food.  Quality meat (or fish) about twice per week, small amounts of diary, carbohydrate served with olive oil. Large amounts of vegetables. Mediterranean appears to be the best overall choice.

1425 2018-12-22 21:00:32 I have just written the Premier of Ontario asking if it was feasible to have the GM plant turned into a refinery. We need to work together to keep Canada united in spite of the liberals who want to destroy us. We want Canadian oil, not Saudi oil.

#cdnpoli #onpoli
1426 2018-12-22 21:00:26 Definitely a relationship..but different commodities are going down for different reasons..Oil is down because we have an oversupply thanks to US shale, alternative energy sources and electric vehicles. Lower energy has a pervasive effect through other categories and inflation
1427 2018-12-22 21:00:26 Parsley, basil and green onions. Wash and pat your herbs dry. Put in a blender and blend with a clone of garlic, salt and black pepper and unflavoured oil(groundnut, canola or grape seed oil). Strain, then heat it to evaporate water. Strain with a coffee or oil filter.

1434 2018-12-22 20:59:05 Modi blatantly copies russian democracy and Russia is full of cronies. Russian eco is dependent on oil&gas and consultants say that their technology is decades behind west, and even sometimes worse than india. No competition means no pressure to improve or be more efficient.
1435 2018-12-22 20:59:04 Go for medieval executions Boogie, there's a real untapped market. We haven't had anyone boiled in oil in ages :P
1436 2018-12-22 20:59:01 In 2012 in Tehran I forecast crude oil would collapse when QE ended. It did. In 20th September in Moscow I forecast oil would imminently fall. In both cases in conferences for @isrs_ucl I'm a strategist, what are you, apart from being a troll?
1437 2018-12-22 20:58:58 I think it's a little of both. Some people get very trashy and rude flaunting their rolls, while others take the game way too seriously to the point they blow up over others' results in a system they know is pure chance, and both of these things oil the retention/money machine.
1438 2018-12-22 20:58:48 Thanks! Loving the boxes so far! Can't wait for my grapefruit to do the Grapefruit Olive Oil cake.
1439 2018-12-22 20:58:44 Now imagine cold water diving.  Same cold, much better conductivity.  The butter is drenched in olive oil after a few days of that.

JERK....sadly a snake oil situation.
1448 2018-12-22 20:57:24 And when the oil and gas runs out in 50 years what will we do for energy? Nuclear & coal = 130 years. a growing 7.5 billion people now accelerates depletion. Take the less than perfect and find solutions = human ingenuity/innovation.
1449 2018-12-22 20:57:18 dude, i don't know how much more clearly i can tell you that oil & gas employees aren't even close to a majority of people in texas

i don't think you know much about texas at all
1450 2018-12-22 20:57:15 I always forget about this bc I was taught right from the start to use oil as medium/a cleaner between colors, and to wash my brushes with a brush soap bar. Some people have told me I HAVE to use paint thinner and that the soap is just conditioner but it always worked for me
1451 2018-12-22 20:57:01 There is lots more oil outside our borders and a lot of money come through those borders 
1452 2018-12-22 20:56:53 It was fantastic. No mayo, no oil and vinegar means no soggy sandwich for this guy!
1453 2018-12-22 20:56:50 How exactly is pulling out of an illegal war designed to overthrow a democratically elected government for more oil money a bad thing? You do realize the mainstream media lied about Assad gassing his own people right much like they lied to get into Iraq?
1454 2018-12-22 20:56:43 Surely APC government promise all this! but dont cry with out shed tears, remember all condition it found!, for the first time that the APC government seat in the office there is an empty Nigerian treasury and ecomic crisis do to our rely in crude oil. So be patience.
1455 2018-12-22 20:56:37 Fellas, she just brought baby oil so she can imitate the belt scene from “This Christmas.” 

She thinks she caught you cheating because she has a guilty conscience. 

That’s why your homeboy is a comedian every time she’s around. Lol. Be safe out there.
1456 2018-12-22 20:56:11 Since WW2, the US hasn't fought for the borders or freedom of foreign nations.  It only has fought for oil and self-enrichment. Especially during GOP years.  You are not the first GOP pres. to do so. But, you're a tyrant to boot. #TrumpResign
1457 2018-12-22 20:55:54 Although I'm no oil painting and I don't have much time for societies idea of good looks, when that Liddle fell out the ugly tree, he hit every fucking branch on the way down.
1458 2018-12-22 20:55:28 Not how that works Lee. You need some oil from an old tractor that plowed the corn patch where the MOG shucked corn to swipe on his rabies.
1459 2018-12-22 20:55:15 That's great that you know what to avoid! Does it bother you if you eat something with coconut oil in it?

I break out even from touch. So I'm just screwed

1461 2018-12-22 20:54:45 As for "then why are we still in the middle east?" Follow the money mate. Do some self investigation if you have the time. Between cheap oil, and extreme levels of funding by Israel, we are literally fighting THEIR illegal war. The proxy war games are real.
1462 2018-12-22 20:54:43 Came here for a damn oil change. Why is I’m spending $150???? 
1463 2018-12-22 20:54:33 @realDonaldTrump is a big 'ole pussy but the passing of the legalization hemp and CBD bill is fantastic news. Maybe one day when he retires we can hit the oil together. That's just showbiz baby #Hemp #CBD

1471 2018-12-22 20:53:41 I'm trying to show you what it looks like to people from a non scientific background. Did some fact checking because of the fires we had here. I found an interesting PDF on BC Gov site about sprays to kill trees that eat the most CO2 and give the most oxygen. But kill oil ind. ?
1472 2018-12-22 20:53:36 I’m an oil on canvas/linen guy - only use a pencil for my initial drawing, just a basic 2B graphite, but thought I might try a small portrait with Keith’s recommended Cretacolor pencils.
1473 2018-12-22 20:53:34 So the wells are the only factors in oil and energy. GOT IT. again, it's a deceptively false metric being used, bad oppo masquerading as reporting
1474 2018-12-22 20:53:34 Cars can be used if they are electric and not runned by oil fuel, also hidrogen cars dont pollute.
But i mean the big problem is that using fuel and not electricity gives tons of money to some people and they dont want to change that

1477 2018-12-22 20:52:57 You specifically want cannabis oil with the high levels of THC accompany the CBD. While that in my opinion is the best option in the best route to go, good unadulterated CBD is a powerhouse
1478 2018-12-22 20:52:46 Thank you, Beto. Btw, I’m sure you’re aware of the hit piece on you from David Sirota. Well, here’s from a life long Democrat(I don’t mind labels) and “oil money” donor that will gladly give to you again for 2020!
1479 2018-12-22 20:52:42 I've been dead wrong on oil, so take my views with a grain of salt. But I think everything since ~55 been forced selling. Fundamentals are not bearish, USD hasn't been an issue, & OPEC+ announced a completely sufficient cut (especially in conjunction w Canada's cut).
1480 2018-12-22 20:52:35 It’s a lyric from a Midnight Oil song Beds Are Burning. That gif reminded me of it because he looks like the singer
1481 2018-12-22 20:52:26 I told my dad to check my car bcs I felt it weird and he starts yelling at me bcs he’s like well it needs oil again !okay dad if I fucking knew that I wouldn’t be asking

1484 2018-12-22 20:51:58 One way to tell the difference is through consumption and the sedative effect that high-quality CBD oil has which  this crap that's been floating around does not have

1486 2018-12-22 20:51:37 This year, we decided to keep the house temperature lower than usual because heating oil costs are out of hand. The living room is coldest and there are presently four blankets on the couch of varying sizes. Some nights it is brutal but today
1487 2018-12-22 20:51:36 Had to use my mom’s shampoo this morning... shit got me smellin like some argan oil from Morocco but damn I ain’t hatin it 
1488 2018-12-22 20:51:32 Yes that is the same as explicitly endorsing literal military allies of the US Governent, the destruction of Raqqa, occupation of oil fields, war crimes.

It's the Nazi US government that is "not so great" you asinine neocons.
1489 2018-12-22 20:51:28 Obama fracker in chief? Oil extraction Chief? Sorry but if the shoe fits wear it. Also why did Exxon think the Paris climate deal was great? I don't think it was because they'd have to give up their business.

1492 2018-12-22 20:50:53 @FernandezTarja  I wish you a Merry Christmas and a prosperous year 2019 for you and I present you with a new project for your country. Finland H2G project kicked off in the USA, (95% water and 5% oil) for every vehicle in the world.
1493 2018-12-22 20:50:53 You have plenty of discretionary money outside of Congree. After all, Obama gave $1Billion to Brazil to drill oil in the same place he forbid the US.
Feel free to take 25billion and have the military build it.
1494 2018-12-22 20:50:52 Hemp is also used for making clothing and hemp oil is rumoured to cure/alleviate the symptoms of certain types of cancet.

1496 2018-12-22 20:50:20 US is largest producer of crude oil now this is a multi decade strategy by US to reduce Middle East Oil and extract as much leverage only to 50 years later back its own $ de facto oil standard.  Trump Putin MBS alliance has been agreed.

1501 2018-12-22 20:49:27 Author of this article is making a lot of generalizations and I think that's a mistake there growers in Indiana who are growing for the specific purpose a through z high quality CBD oil they already had a full growing season and we're starting to see these better products

1510 2018-12-22 20:47:49 How about a safe haven in a dollar weakening scenario (in a bear market)....oil strengthens :D
1511 2018-12-22 20:47:40 Jus throw some oil at them
1512 2018-12-22 20:47:35 mannn. just having that oil makes me happy
1513 2018-12-22 20:47:27 Where I live they just passed medical marijuana but it's going to take them over here to decide how they're going to do it however I did find some hemp oil kind of cream that helps with pain as well and it's 100% organic so I'm using that
1514 2018-12-22 20:47:08 You fight for other countries borders. You are not that ignorant. Stop lying. You fight to steal whatever you may find of use in other countries (cough cough oil). No one is so stupid to buy into the things that you say.
1515 2018-12-22 20:46:50 Is there oil in semen?

1517 2018-12-22 20:46:42 Headed home for a few days and I already know my mama is about to have me cleaning every piece of visible furniture in the house. If I have to wax one more decorative plastic tree with baby oil ima lose it

1519 2018-12-22 20:46:36 I would describe the diet as low carb, high protein and relatively low fat. Healthy carbs of green veg, berries, quinoa, occasional wholemeal wraps. Healthy fats - avocado, olive/coconut oil, almonds. Lean protein sources - chicken/turkey/fish/eggs. (1)
1520 2018-12-22 20:46:35 You know you’re adulting when an oil change and new brakes feel good

1522 2018-12-22 20:46:24 I've had this oil and treatment in my hair for like 3-4 hours. I'm being lazy and I don't feel like washing it.
1523 2018-12-22 20:45:50 i need to add almond oil around my eyes to my skincare routine because this ain't it chief
1524 2018-12-22 20:45:45 NEEDY
1525 2018-12-22 20:45:42 Our CBD oil is specifically derived from hemp. I made that clear I thought but I often interchange hemp and cannabis, because the differences are often lost on people who are not advocates
1526 2018-12-22 20:45:36 Yesterday I got the letter stating that my insurance refuses (again) to pay for the CBD oil my doctor prescribed me. I desperately need it, but as a #PhDisabled I can't afford it.
1527 2018-12-22 20:45:22 All alcohol tastes like motor oil tbh
1528 2018-12-22 20:45:21 It seems as if a darkskin woman isn’t drenched in oil or have extreme surgically enhanced features, she’s deemed as ugly.
1529 2018-12-22 20:45:10 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1530 2018-12-22 20:45:10 Removed properly, I have a cuticle oil, that sally Hansen thing and nail glue to try and stop the tearing. Life’s falling apart lmao

Boil your labia in motor oil to bring out that new pussy shine
1535 2018-12-22 20:44:27 Oh my, it seems it was over-deleted and got all shriveled up. *sigh* What else is there to do. Some salt, and pepper, and olive oil, plip-plip-plop

1537 2018-12-22 20:44:19 I do my dailies and not much else.

1540 2018-12-22 20:44:06 So @RachelNotley with Albertans comin out in droves across our province in support of oil & gas do you even think for a moment you could be some of the problem?
1541 2018-12-22 20:44:05 Didn’t realize how bad I needed a oil change until my shit was shaking lol, so here i am on Saturday getting my oil changed. :-)
1542 2018-12-22 20:44:03 I’d agree if there was an Aramco or Gazprom in the U.S., it is way too complicated for independent oil producers to overcome time-consuming and expensive production hurdles in the U.S. The problem for U.S, producers now is to have access water for shale production and to dispose+
1543 2018-12-22 20:43:53 Idk why I didn't buy coconut oil when I knew I was gonna bake potatos during the holiday.

1545 2018-12-22 20:43:46 This isn't news. Taking less than 1% off your donations from employees of oil and gas companies in Texas is not news. It's muckraking nonsense intended to paint anyone but Bernie as unacceptable. And it's pathetic this is the best argument against Beto

1547 2018-12-22 20:43:44 Today has not been good for my wallet:
Expencive Oil Change leads to
"You need new tires"
Trip to the tire store leads to nasty pot hole.
Nasty pot hole leads to 
"What in tar nation did you hit!"
Which leads to horribly bent rim.

FML!
1548 2018-12-22 20:43:43 Get some truly conservative policies and your political life will get even better. You might start with ditching the Dairy marketing cartel. you might also consider a policy of tariffs on imported oil (non USA) to encourage Eastern Canada to use more West oil
1549 2018-12-22 20:43:38 I'd die in a foreign country for that, but if I went off to war I'd be dying so some rich fuck has a slightly better chance of getting oil.
1550 2018-12-22 20:43:30 3- just for show.  We're leaving them to Putin's Russian ( for oil reserves ), Iranian, and Turkey's army, maybe Israeli bombs too, and for ISIS.  Leaving courageous Kurdish forces, our longtime  #1 Allie against ISIS, after almost 200,000 Kurdish casualties to our two, without w
1551 2018-12-22 20:43:25 The funny thing about the protests in France are that they are protesting the implementation of the Paris Climate Change Accords.  (basically, it means that industrial nations pay a new tax on oil that gets given to non-industrial nations in the form of a "carbon credit")

1553 2018-12-22 20:43:12 Read the Indiana law  we're talkin about CBD oil not hemp oil  not THC not any other derivative. There're hundreds of cannabinoids in the cannabis plant thc is probably the least beneficial, and that's saying a lot

1555 2018-12-22 20:43:03 We can shift toward this goal, but oil will still be essential to this world for decades to come. I'll have to ignore the rest of your comments if you disagree with that.

1557 2018-12-22 20:42:51 Time and time again, the MSM will bang their wardrums, to rile us up into the middle east. Why? There is oil there. If the middle east wont sell their oil to the US, at the price the US wants, they invade, or do sanctions, or will do whatever necessary to get it cheaply.

1564 2018-12-22 20:42:24 Do you buy oil or just not run nodes?
1565 2018-12-22 20:42:20 Apparently cbd oil helps for dogs w cancer / old age n shit
1566 2018-12-22 20:42:15 Maybe Canada should look to increasing its GHG to lower the world’s overall pollution. If we increase LNG exports it means some of the 1500 new coal power plants being built may convert over. If Canada can increase oil exports, it could reduce GHG from wars over fuel supplies.
1567 2018-12-22 20:42:10 lrt) I’ve never worked in oil paints but my prof won’t let us use them in studio because the ventilation is bad and breathing in the fumes can lead to serious health problems, same for some acrylic paints too, do research into them/check the backs of products etc, before using

1572 2018-12-22 20:41:46 We need to get out of the Middle East, except for Israel. Stop buying their oil, funding their terror... stop all money and bring our guys home and let them kill each other
1573 2018-12-22 20:41:43 Damn, shout out to Rogers Auto on Michigan Ave, taking my car for a last minute oil change right before Christmas break.
1574 2018-12-22 20:41:43 A. I don't speak French, B. Our grids could never handle a shift like that, so quickly, C. Canadians don't have enough money to convert to electric, collectively, and D. A massive amount of precious metals are mined, and OIL IS USED to produce these cars.
1575 2018-12-22 20:41:40 the fracking boom in texas has increased the proportion of oil & gas employees since 2014, but not enough to make it anywhere close to being the largest sector, much less the majority

1579 2018-12-22 20:41:10 if I have this right only scientists sponsored by big oil are the ones influenced, any other is not influenced at all, even climategate never happened and Mann never conspired to fix data because he's not sponsored by big oil, right, you win #sarcasm
1580 2018-12-22 20:40:59 You also have to ask yourself why now? Think about it.The president is sick. The government hasn’t lived up to all its promises like all governments around the world.They did it now so they can say hey he’s sick anyways let’s get him out of power so we can have control of the oil
1581 2018-12-22 20:40:53 Except we didn't take their oil, they received the market value for every drop.
1582 2018-12-22 20:40:45 We are there for oil, opium (for big pharma), and the distribution of weapons. Our corrupt gov’t wants us there for their own personal gains. Why is everyone fighting our pull out now when 17 years ago no one wanted us there?
1583 2018-12-22 20:40:42 ...our PM and informed us all that this matter would be considered when planning future projects. What on earth could be wrong with that? What on earth would cause Alberta oil wives - women themselves! - to ask him to apologize? For shame!

1585 2018-12-22 20:40:35 Compare AB to Norway though [re: oil revenue et al] and see good governance and fiscal responsibility vs. absolutely the opposite. 44 years of Conservative rule in Alberta, and this province's fortune is still largely hitched to a commodity. It's time to work around it.

1589 2018-12-22 20:40:17 Yes. The Rest of Canada is apparently tired of Alberta. We'll just pack up and be on our way then. We know when we're no longer welcome. Have fun with those transfer payments. You should see a huge spike in your economy without our oil industry dragging you down.

1595 2018-12-22 20:39:48 I’m about to go to the nearest valvoline and propose to the first decent looking mechanic I see. I just need someone to take care of my car because I clearly can’t. In 2019 we’re not trying to marry doctors anymore. It’s all about the people who know how to change oil.
1596 2018-12-22 20:39:41 So Putin wanted this so he could fight against isis wothout us jn syria?  How dumb would that be?  He wants us out bc he wants to take over the oil fields there and put Assad back in place
1597 2018-12-22 20:39:37 I should clarify that brushes are just ONE thing I use to paint with. I also use fingers, and also I need to be able to hold and work with pastels (both soft and oil), charcoal, and other mark-making media. Nails just don't work for me at all.
1598 2018-12-22 20:39:34 No way Harvard accepted him. No damn way.
1599 2018-12-22 20:39:30 6/2 we need to stop burning oil as a source of fuel, which only serves to deplete the cache quicker and pollute the earth and turn to clean energy sources for fuel, so we can use the oil we have to continue producing the products that we need.

You need plenty of cuticle oil/butter to keep the nail hydrated, then use a nail strengthener in the mean time, like OPI or Sally Hansen. This is the first nail related tweet I've made in a year and a half...my handle needs changed
1606 2018-12-22 20:38:28 It wasn’t oil face
1607 2018-12-22 20:38:24 Eastern Canada is quite happy to receive transfer payments derived from oil production over 11 billion to Quebec alone this is obscene .What is the amount received in transfer payments from Saudi Arabia zero unless you look at the amount paid to political parties .

1610 2018-12-22 20:38:17 5/2 oil is a natural resource that I would be very concerned about depleting because a lot of people don’t realize that oil is the primary ingredient in many products that we rely upon. There is only a finite amount of oil on the planet...

1613 2018-12-22 20:37:30 I disagree that foreign relations are in the gutter. That’s not how I see things. Goods to market? Oil? This government are doing EVERYTHING it can to change that. Borders are the same as ever and you know what they say about death and taxes? Inevitable.

1627 2018-12-22 20:35:31 I'm think you may soon be granted honourary Australian  status! I would also suggest chopping into cubes of about 4cm before roasting, sprinkle with olive oil and pinch of salt and cumin.
1628 2018-12-22 20:35:26 8 hours of shopping... 

And someone has forgotten to get some cooking oil.

Oh well, I'll set my alarm for sparrow fart o'clock, sort out my running kit, and go to bed. I may actually get a bit further on my 10 mile run plan for tomorrow, maybe to the kitchen.

1643 2018-12-22 20:33:14 Start with the Levy Kalecki equation: 
Profits = Net Investment - personal saving + government deficit -CAD
When oil imports fall, CAD shrinks, means less drag on profits. In the last recession it accounted for 2/3rd of initial profits recovery.
1644 2018-12-22 20:33:11 Agriculture still remain the strong means of economic diversification from mono economy in Nigeria, largest workforce employer, and poverty reduction. More work needs to be done to make agricultural production match oil production.
1645 2018-12-22 20:33:01 Uh oh. I spilled Sichuan chili oil in my workout bag.  I guess I will be having a very mala workout.
1646 2018-12-22 20:32:56 Where are the pussy hats?  Thanking Trump for not spilling blood for oil?
1647 2018-12-22 20:32:49 The guy was a carb addict. That's the whole point.

People get addicted to seed oils do they?

Ooooh I've just gotta finish that bottle of seed oil. mmmm yummy
1648 2018-12-22 20:32:38 This is the star comment fam.
 one cannot get into Tesco/Sainsburys oil groceries and claim to pay later or even dinner .
People need to stop being ludicrous and taking freelancers for granted.Big corps have serious TCs don't see why freelancers shouldn't .
1649 2018-12-22 20:32:30 'marijuana smokers' 
Some who get hard time, when

The Constitution,
Gives people the RIGHT to "INGEST" anything into their BODIES, like
'cigarette companies' and, even
'olive oil' that has been proven to be bad to "INGEST" and cause not only obesity, but at times DEATH,
1650 2018-12-22 20:32:30 Oil profits drop to zero though when the world burns
1651 2018-12-22 20:32:22 CBD oil is CBD oil. It's a compound found in hemp called cannabidiol.  this the only thing there is you can't get it from anywhere else. It is extracted from him plant it still contains Trace amounts of THC the psychoactive compound found in hemp.
1652 2018-12-22 20:32:18 Agree few rookie NDP MLAs expected to be in #ableg. #abpoli with UCP, WRP, PC fans raging vs loss of power, it's climate of hate vs NDP MLAs. Another not running, @bpaynemla, accomplished woman, is dissed as 'yoga instructor' despite 15 yrs in oil/gas sector & owning yoga biz
1653 2018-12-22 20:32:16 State of u and your fans. Oil 
1654 2018-12-22 20:32:14 Maybe on some aspects but honestly I am pro clean fracking. We must break the OPEC cartels and end our dependence on Middle Eastern oil. The new green deal will do that as well so I would be open to hearing her out but I remember Obama doing something similar with “green loans”.
1655 2018-12-22 20:32:05 Or gee.... maybe the US could have stopped interfering in the rest of the world’s politics.... oh but there was that pesky need your oil thing. That’s the only time you get involved- when it suits your interests. Bunch of clowns!
1656 2018-12-22 20:31:59 Notice how @inside_r3 wil be another part of XRP rail. Its another commerical DLT.

Example: $XRP is like oil today, and @Ripple is Chevron. @inside_r3 is British Petroleum.

#Ripple could one day, use the asset less than another company / 3rd party.
1657 2018-12-22 20:31:59 Why APC and all other sensible Nigerians are lamenting is because of lost opportunity under PDP. Price of oil has dropped and 16 years is gone.
1658 2018-12-22 20:31:36 Policeman was apologizing to me. He regularly patrols the area. Said he’s never seen my truck and trailer before. I work out of state most of the time, oil and gas industry. He laughed when I said that and told me I live in the most libtard area...unbelievable. No tickets though.
1659 2018-12-22 20:31:32 nails done, pedi done, oil change done, feeling complete 
1660 2018-12-22 20:31:28 Biafran oil and gas is the string that unites Nigeria together since 1958. That is why One Nigeria will continue to be fake.
1661 2018-12-22 20:31:21 You "fight for other borders" in return for money, oil and power...
1662 2018-12-22 20:31:18 Nut it was only Anglican oil so doesn't count?
1663 2018-12-22 20:31:11 Don’t tell me I’m a “baby” for not eating something that may contain sunflower oil. I’d like to live to see tomorrow thx.
1664 2018-12-22 20:31:09 If you're prone to ear infections, look to garlic oil for its antibacterial properties. Use a dropper to apply warm garlic oil inside ear.

1666 2018-12-22 20:31:01 this man told me i look like sweet love and coconut oil and honestly i’ve never heard that before
1667 2018-12-22 20:30:55 All our own means of support thrown out to cheap imitations made in Eastern Europe- crap, essentially- and we turn to Wahabi jihadist Saudi oil to refuel,  instead.
Madness.
1668 2018-12-22 20:30:53  Our Oil & Gas Energy sector workers! Keep up the good fight 
1669 2018-12-22 20:30:51 next to oil energy
1670 2018-12-22 20:30:38 Eaters: what’s your favourite medium spicy chilli oil?
1671 2018-12-22 20:30:17 I hate coming get an oil change
1672 2018-12-22 20:30:04 When the war started you were saying we were there for oil.  If you want to be there, go. Glad my son wont be going
1673 2018-12-22 20:30:02 書き出すとそんなに飲んでない(というか何を飲んだかほとんど思い出せない)
1674 2018-12-22 20:29:59 What makes it great is it’s against OIL FC
1675 2018-12-22 20:29:39 If you don’t have lots of acne then I recommend Cetaphil as a cleanser, or any creamy cleanser that may contain a lil bit of oil. If you looking for moisturizers, I say Pond’s and butters like shea, mango, cocoa butter etc (use em together). toners, Aloe Vera is moisturizing.
1676 2018-12-22 20:29:37 If we build that wall we will kill many species of animals. Buess that doesn't matter to Republicans. 

We're torturing marine life with our sonar explorations for oil. Probably why many whales are beaching themselves, they commit suicide to end their torture. 

God Bless America

1679 2018-12-22 20:28:57 @Heid_oil all the best for you and yours over Christmas and  new year  heid from me ally ...and the dogs Dillon, Murphy and Bronte 
1680 2018-12-22 20:28:52 Bread and red oil for the night . Blissful bliss   .
1681 2018-12-22 20:28:52 Whisk the flour, baking powder, salt & sugar together in a bowl. Add the cornmeal mixture, eggs & oil until it looks smooth. Pour into a pan, bake for 35 minutes 
1682 2018-12-22 20:28:45 I like your predictions, thank you. What do you think about oil, silver and other commodities?
1683 2018-12-22 20:28:39 Is the energy privately owned and sold on the world market? Yes. It's not Independence. Oil prices are still heavily dictated by the Middle East.
1684 2018-12-22 20:28:23 Very astute point. I’m sure American steelworkers wouldn’t benefit. Just like China going with russian oil now that we’re in a trade war with China. Great for russia.
1685 2018-12-22 20:28:19 oil
1686 2018-12-22 20:28:19 i need to stop being lazy & change my oil
1687 2018-12-22 20:28:15 The Manor mission and the fight at the oil factory where you charge down the hill in formation, simply amazing
1688 2018-12-22 20:28:11 And #Syria?  #Bush and #Cheney weren't interested in Syria because it didn't have oil to steal.  The US became involved after problems with #ISIL a result of #GeorgeWBush destabilizing the #MiddleEast by invading #Iraq. Maybe #DonaldTrump is tired of spending on that, too.
1689 2018-12-22 20:28:06 Maybe because your hospitals have no medicine or your mothers deliver babies on cement floors and 19 women die daily in labour. Or that you have 100 units of blood for 43mln. Or that your education is diluted and your MPs are illiterate. Or that you have oil????
1690 2018-12-22 20:28:03 The economy is booming. We have over a 4% GDP.  Obama barely had 2% and said it was the new normal.  Where have you been.  Unemployment is at an all time low.  Why do you think Obama wants to take credit for it?  We are the largest oil produced in the world now.
1691 2018-12-22 20:27:59 Oil company money ensures Beta will fold to their demands
1692 2018-12-22 20:27:54 聴いたことある曲がいっぱいあって楽しかった〜
Olive Oilさんもめっちゃいい人で、もっと色んな曲聴いてまた行きたいな〜
1693 2018-12-22 20:27:48 i got my oil change for free s/o to tire kingdom for saving me $35 lol
1694 2018-12-22 20:27:40 1 1/2 cups cornmeal - 2 1/2 cups milk - 2 cups white flour - 1 tbsp baking powder - 1 tsp salt - 2/3 cup white sugar - 2 eggs - 1/2 cup vegetable oil - Preheat oven to 400 degrees - combine cornmeal & milk; let stand for a few minutes. Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan..
1695 2018-12-22 20:27:27 Beto is a Wolf in Sheep’s clothing.  Do not support a man who took the no oil money pledge and then broke it when offered oil money for his campaign.  His Beto and Switch is not what we need.
Bernie Sanders 2020!!!
1696 2018-12-22 20:27:14 CBD oil is proven to stop grand mal seizures it's proven to stop other forms of seizure such as epilepsy it is proven to help control things like ADHD and anxiety it's proven to retard and reverse the growth of cancer cells. There have been many many studies on this
1697 2018-12-22 20:27:11 Olive oil, lard, butter, bacon grease. Savor the sweat animal flavor, not you olive
1698 2018-12-22 20:27:06 Who drains the extra oil from their peanut butter? Besides me....
1699 2018-12-22 20:27:01 I’m obsessed with this plug in oil I bought  Got my whole room smelling like sweet peppermint
1700 2018-12-22 20:26:44 I might have put a lil too much coconut oil on my face. Shiny as fuck
1701 2018-12-22 20:26:41 linseed oil was there for me when paint thinner tried to kill me 
1702 2018-12-22 20:26:32 I think we need a draft... What do you think... least Bush kept his promise not to rip your children fresh from graduation and draft their ignorant asses. Tell me do you know the reason we can’t nuke the MidEast? 10x’s worse with oil in the equation!!!
1703 2018-12-22 20:26:32 Any data online?
1704 2018-12-22 20:26:29 Hopefully all those hippy gardens can feed all of them because with out oil and gas there's no trucksor boats to ship their food.
1705 2018-12-22 20:26:24 If he ate chips / fries in a restaurant, I will bet you $1,000 it was fried in high-L6 seed oil.  Even the so-called high-end restaurants do that.  Very rare to find a restaurant that deep fries in lard or tallow.
1706 2018-12-22 20:26:18 Man my old avenger went through so much oil in between oil changes, this bitch I have now is perfect
1707 2018-12-22 20:26:06 All the more reason to elect  @POTUS to 2nd term: If ISIS comes back, he will beat them down again: He did not make a speech to them about their evil ways, he took them out: They did not carry the oil with them, so there is no fight about DEM's using that for "mo' voters.
1708 2018-12-22 20:25:53 ok, even with gas station employees included that's not even close to being true

you're just very wrong here: oil & gas employees are a small fraction of texans, dwarfed by other much larger sectors like agricultural workers, manufacturing workers, retail employees, etc.
1709 2018-12-22 20:25:52 Oil/Vinegar Uneducated
1710 2018-12-22 20:25:44 I need some lavender oil. Honestly
1711 2018-12-22 20:25:41 Pls verify this as soon as possible,as the villagers were told to pay for the oil. We don't only pay for bills,we pay for the transformer oil.
1712 2018-12-22 20:24:54 Who the fuck is Kathy Castor? Why the fuck should big oil have a voice?!
1713 2018-12-22 20:24:51 Oil plugs your arteries and salt raises your blood pressure.
Eat what you want. The Earth has too many humans on it now...
1714 2018-12-22 20:24:13 Fish oil, Black seed oil and Oregano oil >>>
1715 2018-12-22 20:23:35 weed, dabs, vape pen/oils, grinders, bongs, cbd oil, neat likkle smoke room too. also there is a tour of the facility at a cost too.
1716 2018-12-22 20:23:24 tasia basically called me, woke me up and is now explaining to me what an oil change is..........
1717 2018-12-22 20:23:11 Did I really need an oil change or did I really want to take cami out for a spin? 
1718 2018-12-22 20:23:05 ...here I spend all of my life taking biotin, zinc, applying coconut and castor oil concoctions for that kind of hair and they’re just wasting it 
1719 2018-12-22 20:22:58 9 y/0: If coconut oil is made from coconuts, vegetable oil is made from vegetables, and avocado oil is made from avocados, what is baby oil made from?
1720 2018-12-22 20:22:53 Thodi si economics padhi hoti to itni problem nahi hoti.. 
Do some research before suggesting to bring petroleum under GST. Oil prices are never stable and NOT governed by Indian government.
1721 2018-12-22 20:22:48 Looks like Beto became Beta for the oil companies
1722 2018-12-22 20:22:40 Is there oil in Syria 
1723 2018-12-22 20:22:39 Done! Really need an oil change 
1724 2018-12-22 20:22:30 Am I correct in saying that oil demand is expected to grow even after aggressive climate policies are enacted?
1725 2018-12-22 20:22:23 Got Jordan’s oil changed, washed his truck, and ordering him his truck a new tire.... he better give me the best damn back and foot massage.
1726 2018-12-22 20:22:19 View the oil rigs
1727 2018-12-22 20:22:14 Drink the olive oil
1728 2018-12-22 20:22:08 Why do these corporate giants who are allegedly helping to kill mankind via making the planet unloveable make these heartwarming films about the very human spirit their practices are helping to eradicate. Make a film about the effects of an oil spill by all means.
1729 2018-12-22 20:22:06 Almost pulled my shorts at 2450. Should have. Just had that nagging feeling. I'll probably get run over on Monday. EM seems interesting in short run. Falling dollar/oil should at least provide short term boost
1730 2018-12-22 20:22:06 Unless your Syria and you sell oil...that is not taxed. Fraud.
1731 2018-12-22 20:22:03  you’d have to be working in Oil & Gas to be pulling in 100K at 25 ...so H-town would make sense 
1732 2018-12-22 20:21:59 An honest conversation would reveal the true $$$ costs of Canadian oil extraction.  There is NO business case to justify pipelines. Problem is, the power brokers keep the conversation dishonest in order to justify the business case (& make the few even wealthier!)
1733 2018-12-22 20:21:40 Have a great getaway! Viva "Roma"! Happy you'll have time w/your brother. Ylang Ylang essential oil does a psychololgical joy job on my limbic system. These days need it more desperately than it other times in recent memory.
1734 2018-12-22 20:21:39 The idea that 97% of scientists are all in the pockets of some rich corporations to somehow make this planet more greener, safe and habitable but the oil sponsored politicians you literally worship are actually in it for altruism is quite a feat of phony intellect.
1735 2018-12-22 20:21:37 An oil tanker named after a university. Only in Russia.
1736 2018-12-22 20:21:36 Oil #VoleiNaGazeta
1737 2018-12-22 20:21:35 Didn't know oil is bouncing in a bear market :D
1738 2018-12-22 20:21:24 The only thing I need to do is get the car a oil change but I don’t feel like it 
1739 2018-12-22 20:21:23 took 20mls of cbd oil lmao
1740 2018-12-22 20:21:23 mans can’t just stfu and do your oil change eh
1741 2018-12-22 20:21:14 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
1742 2018-12-22 20:21:11 @trending_medic any recommendations on naturally inducing labor without castor oil?
1743 2018-12-22 20:20:44 If politicians and scientists wanted money, why don't they work for the oil companies? Do you generally believe that all scientists are therefore liars and when you require medicine you refuse to it because you can't trust why they'd use it?
1744 2018-12-22 20:20:25 I’ll never forget the one time Lorenzo called me a Bruja bc I used peppermint oil to clear his sinuses and give life to his respiratory system Lmaooo
1745 2018-12-22 20:20:16 No. They are definitely not doctors. They peddle their snake oil products, have no understanding of pathophysiology, and have no “real studies”. If you have the slightest bit of scientific knowledge, you can easily see their “studies” are hugely flawed.
1746 2018-12-22 20:20:15 Still difficult in oil and gas......might start fruit trading again
1747 2018-12-22 20:20:14 We froze their assets and then released them.  It was their oil money we froze from overseas. We didn’t actually send them anything.
1748 2018-12-22 20:20:13 How is it bad???

Every price of any commodity or service in the world is influence by the law of demand and supply. Name it?

Crude oil, gold, forex, transport......anything.

This is not politics.....but common sense!
1749 2018-12-22 20:19:43 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of The LORD for ever.
1750 2018-12-22 20:19:42 Keep thinking that.  Economy failing how?  Low oil prices bad?  Better deal than NAFTA?  Yup, lots of failure there.
1751 2018-12-22 20:19:37 Most of those though have palm oil, but there is #Naturli butter now #Yummy
1752 2018-12-22 20:19:36 Yeah I've been keeping up with her politics ever since she got on Twitter, you've been sold snake oil
1753 2018-12-22 20:19:23 most the videos id seen had been using acrylic paints thank god. but its def something to be concerned abt! i know when i took art classes at my local community college, oil paints had been banned from the on campus studio space for these reasons.
1754 2018-12-22 20:19:16 Ohhhh, anti-Semite too?  I hope not.  Israel has a history of helping others--even those who despise them.  Perhaps the oil rich nations of the Middle East could step up to take this over? You know- the ones who REFUSE to take in their Muslim brethren.
1755 2018-12-22 20:18:58 This! Is why I switched to using linseed oil during my oil painting classes- but it turns out I’m super allergic to linseed whoops. So I use mineral spirits now, but only out on my porch.

1758 2018-12-22 20:18:40 I am truly useless,  you are correct.  I also have TDS, and one of the main symptoms is having compassion for human beings who are in less fortunate situations....another symptom is the ability to detect BS from snake oil salesmen.  How can I get help to fix this?
1759 2018-12-22 20:18:28 And #DonaldTrump wanting to reduce forces in #Afghanistan?  Remember the #Caspain #oil #pipeline?  #GeorgeWBush made sure that deal was signed before Afghanistan had its first post-US-invasion #elections, where former #Unocal negotiator #HamidKarzai was elected...
1760 2018-12-22 20:18:24 I like the classic technique! Was it acrylics, or guache... Oil?
1761 2018-12-22 20:18:20 Ormai la PA è diventata un'area di privilegio assoluto. Vinci il concorso e vinci la lotteria: come lavorare nel settore Oil&Gas, Banche, Assicurazioni, Pharma, anzi meglio.

1767 2018-12-22 20:17:30 you said the "large majority" of people in texas work in oil & gas and that's fantastically untrue
1768 2018-12-22 20:17:11 Well, if Trump-Zinke-Bernhardt BLM is shut down, they can't lease more public land to oil-gas-coal? Nice to find some silver lining in the Trump mess!

1771 2018-12-22 20:16:54 It's true that capitalism has got us to this point, but not alone. And it seems to have no answers yet other than dont worry about it or pretend it's not happening. Big oil and corporates have only themselves to blame if others are offering solutions that dont include them.

1779 2018-12-22 20:16:10 turns out snake oil is actually a breakthrough butter substitute
1780 2018-12-22 20:16:06 We're all told to smother a chip pan fire with a damp towel. Having had to have done it, I know it's not so easy as just saying it: it's scary, and you do get burnt. But it does stop your kitchen from catching fire.
Don't use a dripping wet towel: that'll hurt when the oil spits.

1782 2018-12-22 20:15:44 What do you think Kenney will do that will fix the oil industry? I haven’t actually seen a platform other than carbon levy = bad.
1783 2018-12-22 20:15:32 BREAKING: Union declare war with Confederate States.

FAR-LEFT: No blood for oil!
1784 2018-12-22 20:15:30 I just found that exact pan at a thrift store! It's not too bad with enough oil.
1785 2018-12-22 20:15:29 Can you get CBD where you are? I used to get up to 3 migraines a month (at least 3 days each). I take Avidekel CBD oil from MedReLeaf. (Your required dose may be different, I take .5ml to .75ml 3-4x / day). And IF I feel a migraine coming on, I take a Triptan (like zomig)...

1787 2018-12-22 20:15:25 Scheer is legit trying to gain votes with capitalism, big oil, anti-immigration, and anti-women rhetoric. I sincerely hope that anyone who cares about the environment and other human beings doesn’t fall for his trash fire politics.
1788 2018-12-22 20:15:25 Woke up with a mild headache, and that includes my face? Took a couple ibuprofen and hammered down my usual 32oz of used-engine-oil-style coffee, and got to flatting. Page 21 start to finish 1.5 hours. On to page 22!

1790 2018-12-22 20:15:18 Remember when Bush Sr. made the mistake saying the Saudis HAD to sell us oil? They didn't and the US made nice.
1791 2018-12-22 20:15:16 It's all theatrics. Nothing will stop the oil.

1793 2018-12-22 20:14:48 I pay 80 for oil change
1794 2018-12-22 20:14:43 Ok, I see your apparent hatred of how America has been treating everything and everyone for 100 years or so, when oil was found, cannabis was banned. For petty reasons, no less. But I am slow, and I apologize for not really being in synch with your responses...
1795 2018-12-22 20:14:40 RECIPE #5

- 2 tbsp dry orange peel powder
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 10-12 drops almond oil
1796 2018-12-22 20:14:28 To protect oil shipping lanes?

1802 2018-12-22 20:13:37 Thank you. What is your view on the profitability of Oil and Natural Gas producers (US shale) from a long term perspective - positive, negative or too many variables?
1803 2018-12-22 20:13:36 That’s motor oil
1804 2018-12-22 20:13:20 There is no comparison, one is infinite, one is not. However, right now, oil runs the world, as such, having the third largest reserves isn't about what we actually pump today, it's what we can in the future. It attracts those who exploit it, by any means.
1805 2018-12-22 20:13:20 Thanks, added oil and antifreeze. No bueno. Considered smacking the boy in the back of head. Mrs. Admin said no. Tow it to garage on Monday

1807 2018-12-22 20:13:03 Bring in them oil money in January, I say. Fuck UEFA, cannot make more mistakes from now on in the League. Rather see United got back to back relegated than Liverpool lifting the Premier League trophy. Come you, Arabs!
1808 2018-12-22 20:13:01 Blessed day !! Let’s get this oil money

1811 2018-12-22 20:12:35 I care about the future of the planet.  I have trouble wrapping my head around why the government hits us with a carbon tax, then supposedly refunds it.  Then they spend $6 billion in the oil patch buying a pipeline they will likely never build
1812 2018-12-22 20:12:23 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

1820 2018-12-22 20:11:25 What about if you made money in it then divested away from oil, like beto?
1821 2018-12-22 20:11:12 We don't know what those in power are trying to force Trump to do. Maybe try to overthrow Assad and kill a million people in the process so Europe can have access to more oil. Maybe Trump is pulling troops out to prevent it.
1822 2018-12-22 20:10:50 I lost my beard oil... I'm pissed
1823 2018-12-22 20:10:47 The human & ecological costs of oil extraction are enormous, - in Canada particularly.  An honest conversation, where GDP is calculated including externality costs, would show the true cost of oil extraction.  Guaranteed, #GreenTech would start looking a whole lot more enticing!
1824 2018-12-22 20:10:41 I see nothing wrong with our country's educational system that can't be corrected. Starting with the caliber of teachers. We've trusted & been complacent too long and now we will change but you can go peddle your snake oil somewhere else. It's not just math. You use that as bait.

1831 2018-12-22 20:10:04 And why did we sponsor our client Saddam's assault on Iran?

Because Iranians were still angry about Operation Ajax, deposing an elected leader because he wanted Iran's oil to work for Iranians.

Iran never asked for this. We had no enemies in the Middle East just 70 years ago.
1832 2018-12-22 20:10:03 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
1833 2018-12-22 20:09:55 I read this like surely no one is being so stupid but lo and behold the comments.

I skip the turpentine entirely on the rare occasion I oil paint and just depend on liquin which is marginally less toxic.
1834 2018-12-22 20:09:45 oil cheap was super cheap at that point in time and the world was the most peaceful it has ever been. But I do agree with you, trickle down has a 40 year history of failure

1836 2018-12-22 20:09:08 Why don’t you ask for a flaming oil mote surrounding the whole USA.

1839 2018-12-22 20:08:24 And they are completely complicit with leftist mob rule. On a much larger scale. These dix need to prove that the recession once every ten years was necessary. We now know that it wasn't and the oil tycoons should be brought up on charges of conspiracy. Oil goes down Fed goes up.
1840 2018-12-22 20:08:15 For sure, olive oil is a luxury. If I could have a garden things would be a little easier, but as is, I can during the summer, make my own bread, use every piece of food. Bones and veg scraps become stock, skin becomes cooking fat, meats get stretched with grain, etc.
1841 2018-12-22 20:07:58 I’d do a BP oil disaster all over that
1842 2018-12-22 20:07:55 Junction in Canton. They’re usually awesome there. Weird taste makes me think the frying oil was left in overnight or something. 
1843 2018-12-22 20:07:55 The most profitable cows are the ones grown in the shade of an oil pumpjack.
1844 2018-12-22 20:07:55 Obama wanted to build pipline inside Syria, and the regime change in order to control the oil supply in Syria.
1845 2018-12-22 20:07:50 George, come on!! 130 years of dependence on oil, gas, and coal!  These businesses can do their own security.  Our troops are supposed to be defending These United States, not industrial complexes.
We could replace the oil industry with Hemp oil in 1 to 2 seasons.
1846 2018-12-22 20:07:45 masterchef judge: unfortunately u did leave the mackerel to cure for a moment too long so it's started to cook and that sauce has split bc u added the oil a bit too quickly

me, shovelling fistfuls of doritos down my throat: rookie mistake
1847 2018-12-22 20:07:29 Shout to @CravingChloe with her hair essential oil hair growing growing! 
1848 2018-12-22 20:07:27 With the deals with China and India, I seriously doubt the oil gets stopped in reference to Iran, besides we never really stopped it before. My question since the abandonment of our allies caused a career marine to quit, have we just set the stage for bin laden 2.0?
1849 2018-12-22 20:07:14 I guess you only know un-informed people... WE are over there because of the PETRO-DOLLAR nothing else... Pull our people out and send in the Bombers and turn that whole area into a glass and oil factory... Then send the Rothchilds and the Rockefellers the bill.
1850 2018-12-22 20:07:04 Use coconut oil. Swish it around your mouth for about 15 mins. Hangover immediately gone
1851 2018-12-22 20:06:58 一回目なんだが？？？？
1852 2018-12-22 20:06:56 @Ford Your engineers are assholes. Is there any particular reason they made it as difficult as possible to change the oil in a 2014 F150?
1853 2018-12-22 20:06:55 Gas, Water, Oil, Communication Law's Apply, Banking, u let the Ukraine area back in our lives & I won't stand 4 it!

1855 2018-12-22 20:06:33 I wonder @ruffnecknation all the oil truck protests in AB&SK be more effective if they pooled resources to pay for 10% of those trucks to drive to Ottawa and protest there? Better to haul the bed trucks, but I think they should be there, not just the highway rigs. What say U?
1856 2018-12-22 20:06:32 We haven't got nearly enough boiling oil to pour down it. #ReasonsNotToBuildTheWall

1858 2018-12-22 20:06:12 @realDonaldTrump Guyana have just discovered potential of 5 billion Barrels of oil with the collaboration of ExxonMobil. However Venezuela is making a point of testing the soverignity of our country with their latest move of intercepting a ExxonMobil contracted drillship. Help
1859 2018-12-22 20:06:12 Nice deal! We just got ours working!!! It’s a huge 16kW standby Generac generator. Apparently we weren’t supposed to run it for a day and a half without giving it a break. Lol. Oil cap came off & blew oil everywhere. Cleaned it up, refilled the oil & now it’s working again. Phew!
1860 2018-12-22 20:06:10 Yoghurt, honey, castor oil and egg yolk. Deep conditioner for hair during harmattan.
1861 2018-12-22 20:06:07 Have u heard of chop saws, tunnels or airplanes? You know Turkey supports ISIS by buying their oil, right? You know Erdogan's daughter built a hospital on the border for wounded ISIS soldiers, right?
1862 2018-12-22 20:05:53 Great work alone up front Wilf. Occupied 3 of the oil boys
1863 2018-12-22 20:05:42 I keep forgetting to treat myself kindly, so I'm putting on some perfume oil & making myself some soba noodles with peanut sauce, and I'm going to start reading the last Murderbot book by Martha Wells.

Because I deserve kindness.
1864 2018-12-22 20:05:24 When I was college the Persian Gulf War was going on. I remember the leftist protestors then: 'no blood for oil', 'Bush = Adolf', 'flee to Canada if there's a draft', etc. 

Now you guys like endless foreign wars, because Muh Bad Orange Man? Weird.
1865 2018-12-22 20:05:23 She was leaking oil:.(((

1867 2018-12-22 20:05:12 More obvious lies from @wearenorth99 
The 5 biggest oil companies in Canada are:
Suncor
CNRL
Cenovus
Imperial
Husky
Not a single one of them has laid off anybody. The reason they remain profitable is that they have a lot of US holdings. They also paid $4.72 billion in taxes.
1868 2018-12-22 20:05:00 What about me olive oil?
1869 2018-12-22 20:04:55 if it weren't for shale, oil prices would be $200 a barrel now, or whatever you could afford. Either way, demand destruction would be enormous had shale been a failure. If true, we're in even more trouble because prime acreage is used up now.
1870 2018-12-22 20:04:20 perhaps I shouldn't be allowed in kitchens. making a pot roast for family Christmas dinner and managed to slightly burn myself on the hot olive oil. this is the 3rd time I've burned myself in a kitchen in a month 
1871 2018-12-22 20:04:13 How can you take anyone seriously about TGND with facts like “Amtrak will be underwater and we can’t drink oil?”
1872 2018-12-22 20:04:09 For y’all who love Nutella but want to stop eating products with palm oil... Costco makes a generic “hazelnut spread” that tastes exactly the same without any palm oil. Take care of your body, AND the environment. you’re welcome.
1873 2018-12-22 20:04:03 What you meant to write was that your editors insisted that any of the few stories published on Singh are negative, like this one.

1877 2018-12-22 20:03:48 I think I get it now. You're a Trump fan. I used to be before I smartened up. Trump literally stuck a knife in the back of every oil driller in the world on Nov 5th and if you don't see that then we have nothing left to discuss.
1878 2018-12-22 20:03:32 The state of Virginia is going to make me open up my cbd oil stash early
1879 2018-12-22 20:03:10 I'm wondering if I can give it back, next Christmas, if I repackage it as lightly scented lamp oil?

And a Happy Christmas to you, too!
1880 2018-12-22 20:02:59 I need oil, lead, and steel. BULLETS FOR DAYS!

1883 2018-12-22 20:02:37 So you would rather burn oil and wreck the environment for future generations... if there isn’t a good environment, it doesn’t matter about jobs, cause we will all be dead... when will people realize that...
1884 2018-12-22 20:02:37 A complete big oil shill!!!! Bernie bots just love to over react. You know Beto is from Texas right? And part of his job as a congressman is to support Texans right? Cherry pick all you want. All the way to irrelevance.

1886 2018-12-22 20:02:24 He already is...look at the price of oil dropping. That equals less $$$ in the pockets of Iranians on top of the sanctions. Double whammy.
1887 2018-12-22 20:02:21 gas and oil prices lower for 3 months thank you
1888 2018-12-22 20:02:05 Can't help but notice that both the Conservatives and enviro groups are using the same "OMG Libs are exempting Big Oil" attack line on what's actually a pretty sound policy tool. SMH.
1889 2018-12-22 20:01:44 HOW DO WE REMOVE THE THC FROM OUR CANNABIS? Once oil from the whole plant is extracted, the small traces of THC in the oil are isolated and removed without harming the other very important cannabinoids and terpenes that naturally occur in our cannabis strain. #cbd #cbdoil #hemp
1890 2018-12-22 20:01:34 it's amazing how people think this is 2015/2016 all over again! This isn't a market share war like 2015 was. The fall in oil companies' share price is a direct reflection of the size of the knife Trump lodged into their backs on Nov 5th.
1891 2018-12-22 20:01:33 I’m the kimi oil
1892 2018-12-22 20:01:29 Even though he still somewhat despises Christmas, he appreciates the gifts he's been getting so far.

A bunch of Mad Max movies, and a bottle of oil/hydrorepellent.
1893 2018-12-22 20:01:20  I have noticed lately that if I'm checking my oil or putting in my tires that younger people will come and offer to help me!!
1894 2018-12-22 20:01:14 We the people had no say in sending troops into Syria. How long Senator do you want to fight this war? The Afghans beat the Russians, after they spent nearly two decades there. We have been there nearly two decades, for what? Oil? Israel? What is the definition of winning there?
1895 2018-12-22 20:01:13 Well I hope you and the incoming beard oil have a Very Happy Christmas.
1896 2018-12-22 20:01:11 Get some oil of oregano. 2 drops under your tongue every day. Won’t help you now, but I haven’t had a cold in over a year
1897 2018-12-22 20:01:08 Plenty. Saudi Arabia's gender apartheid  should have had the world boycotting it decades ago. But women never seem to matter that much. And especially not when oil is at stake.
1898 2018-12-22 20:00:55 Nor is the GOP the standard bearer of "family values" and personal responsibility. What a lot of bullshit, but there are snake oil preachers and Fox News that still convince the aggressively stupid that the GOP gives a shit about them. Sadistic and tragic.
1899 2018-12-22 20:00:54 For exam, AB gov is providing half a billion in subsidies for new oil refineries. Or tax incentives for manufacturing jobs. Or think of all the economic incentives that were dangled before Amazon when they looks at a new HQ.

Pretty normal when developing new industry.
1900 2018-12-22 20:00:52 It took @realDonaldTrump to turn raging lunatic "No Blood for Oil" prog pacifist drum-circle idiots into sober neocons overnight.

Is there anything the most amazing President in U.S. history cannot accomplish?

1903 2018-12-22 20:00:36 Did y’all peep?? I think they showed the exploding oil rig from Man Of Steel in #AQUAMAN
1904 2018-12-22 20:00:32 Well, i am ok with staying in my corner if they stay in theirs. 
Let's be honest, if oil wasn't discovered in Basra, we wouldn't give a darn about the region.
1905 2018-12-22 20:00:30 Browned off onion, garlic, ginger, 5 spice, star anise in a pan with a little oil.. Then rolled featherblade joint in mix, added a couple of quartered clementine . Cooked at 160c for a couple hrs... Then poured in beef stock... Soy sauce.. Mirin.. Cooked under foil until tender
1906 2018-12-22 20:00:29 Let your BEARD GAME be on POINT come 2019! Groom better quality beard with this super amazing beard oil. Disclaimer: Some say this oil is known to make hair grow even on an egg. So whether you have a beard or wish to have a beard, you need this. INBOX ME IF INTERESTED.
1907 2018-12-22 20:00:27 It’s complex mix there:

- OPEC mix has many jugular members with totally different end goals of how to twist arms with oil.

- One OPEC player wants to capture market to alienate the other big player even at the cost of dipping into reserves to balance budget.

- and many more
1908 2018-12-22 20:00:23 I watched it. Two hour convoy. Oil patch, farmers, local lumber yards, plus people from Taber and other towns participating in it. Couldn't be prouder. No disrespectful signs. People want pipelines and to go to do their jobs. No handouts

1910 2018-12-22 20:00:18 And imported oil is not subject to the "upstream emissions" criteria, especially when it comes from regimes with no carbon tax ... Its unfair to domestic producers who abide by the rules.

1914 2018-12-22 20:00:12 It took @realDonaldTrump to turn raging lunatic "No Blood for Oil" prog pacifist drum-circle idiots into sober neocons overnight.

Is there anything the most amazing President in U.S. history cannot accomplish?

1915 2018-12-22 20:00:12 the oil companies nowadays aren’t even trying to hide it. “buy our shit or go fuck yourself”
1916 2018-12-22 20:00:05 Why couldn't the FOMC have paused in Dec and waited till the first meeting of 2019 to hike interest rates? The FOMC lowered inflationary targets, real GDP and increased expected unemployment rate. Commodity price have plunged: copper, lumber, hot rolled steel, crude oil.
1917 2018-12-22 20:00:02 When you go in for an oil change and they immediately start telling you all the other 10,000 other things you need. Geez with the upsell  #justdowhatiasked
1918 2018-12-22 19:59:56 Im awake, im going to grab some food and oil my bones and go live.
1919 2018-12-22 19:59:43 He prob gets so much money from oil companies and the NRA he doesn't need his govt paycheck anymore.
1920 2018-12-22 19:59:42 When ur dad takes ur car for an oil change and then also fills the tank 
1921 2018-12-22 19:59:36 I don’t get thank god but I remember rebiff days, and I used almond oil!
1922 2018-12-22 19:59:35 How much was a barrel of oil when Obasanjo came in? @ProfOsinbajo
1923 2018-12-22 19:59:10 I’ve made the herb oil tonight. 
A little burnt. But still green. 
Should probably bake the beet tonight as well
1924 2018-12-22 19:59:05 Noted, ta! We kept the fireplace after the oil heating went in, but have never bothered lighting the fire since. I do miss a crackle.
1925 2018-12-22 19:59:02 I have TMJ and it's usually triggered by stress. Use peppermint oil for pain and then whatever helps you best with anxiety! also, I usually go to chiropractor and get my neck adjusted because sometimes I'm grinding more when the nerves in my neck are fucked.
1926 2018-12-22 19:58:57 @narendramodi @AmitShah @BJP4India 

Sir,  aap iss bar income tax 5 lakh tak free kar do,  petroleum oil ko gst me lake sasta kar do..  Dekho 400 seat akele BJP ko milati h ki nhi.. Desh sudharo lekin bhikhari ke kataura me dalate raho. Yaha buniyadi chijo se logo ko matlab nhi h
1927 2018-12-22 19:58:34 He was fantastic domestically because there was usually only one other club challenging United for the first 10 PL seasons before Chelsea got money. Ferguson’s greatest feat was his ability to adapt when the likes of Chelsea and City came along with oil money.
1928 2018-12-22 19:58:30 I'm Kosher and because of 911 I have to take Krill oil to repair my brain and my 3rd eye
1929 2018-12-22 19:58:27 Well, my point was if the Libs wanted to show leadership,the tax for  resources such as coal (china) and oil (usa) should be applied to them ... Remember the downstream emission argument used to kill Energy East?
1930 2018-12-22 19:58:26 It's the government, whatcha expect? IT and government are like oil and water.
1931 2018-12-22 19:58:22 Budget 2019 strange projections;
Crude Oil Prices 60 dollars per barrel
Growth for the year at 3.01%
Exchange rate N305 to $1
Oil Production Benchmark 2.3million Barrels Per Day
Inflation Target for the year 9.98%

No wonder they heckled the President! This is so unrealistic!
1932 2018-12-22 19:58:13 I guess if I didn’t hit the tire and fuck up my oil pan, I wouldn’t have found out that the lady repair done was done horribly wrong.
1933 2018-12-22 19:57:50 I love how everyone still thinks shale is going to produce huge amounts of oil in 2019. It's going to be a major disappointment and the price has to go higher from here. Nobody is talking about Iran exports dropping in May as well.
1934 2018-12-22 19:57:26 Hope that's not oil he's being "smeared" with! 
1935 2018-12-22 19:57:23 I love coconut oil. Skin and hair smoooth and glistening. Meanwhile Im dying of dehydration and no body can tell. Amazing.
1936 2018-12-22 19:57:16 Mom : take me to get a haircut  
Me: ok
Mom: let’s stop by Macy’s first. Oh! Then we have to go to Costco to get oil. Then we can go get the hair cut

 I swear I get played every time she asks me to drive her somewhere
1937 2018-12-22 19:57:05 New synthetic oil and full tank of shell so nice bruh like my car feels like I’m riding in clouds or something haha

1939 2018-12-22 19:56:31 Coconut oil on my Darkskin be having the skin glistening 
1940 2018-12-22 19:56:17 That’s adorable. You think we use oil because of campaign contributions instead of about the other hundred thousands indispensable applications for which we have no substitute. Oh to be young and ignorant again!
1941 2018-12-22 19:56:17 i feel bad for the guys changing my oil rn bc i have gas spilled in my trunk and there’s random ass shit everywhere in my car lmao ugh my life is a mess
1942 2018-12-22 19:56:03 Lush kalamazoo, keep skin well moisturized. I use cosmetic lad from lush and also an aftershave moisturizer and a pre shave oil to stop razor burn
1943 2018-12-22 19:56:01 Paint a mason jar and fill it with homemade body scrub (sugar, coconut oil and essential oil)
1944 2018-12-22 19:55:53 I went to an art class in middle school and we worked almost exclusively with oils and turpentine... I mean I knew turpentine was “dangerous” (like, don’t drink it, weirdos), but I never knew that oil paints themselves were that dangerous!
1945 2018-12-22 19:55:42 We know Iran did it. We blamed Libya because we wanted Gaddafi gone so Marathon, ConocoPhillips and Hess could break the Libyan National Oil Corporation's monopoly. Just as  Halliburton's Cheney and Rumsfeld wanted Saddam gone. Just as Unocal wanted the Taliban gone.
1946 2018-12-22 19:55:29 Haven't used it myself, but boss' friend w/colon cancer says it's the only substance that relieves all her symptoms - pain, nausea, etc. - plus gives her an appetite. Co-worker's mom w/severe back pain was able to reduce almost all opoids w/CBD oil.
1947 2018-12-22 19:55:18 Too many people just cannot believe some people could be so greedy and insidious as to sabotage a whole industry in a rival independent nation but the proof is in the pudding and that IS what is happening to #abpoli oil nowadays, naifs notwithstanding. It also hurts #bcpoli.
1948 2018-12-22 19:55:06 Free oil change and tire rotation 
1949 2018-12-22 19:54:44 If Trump cuts off their oil exports in May they won't have money for much fighting before too long. This is going to get very interesting now. Oil should not be falling!
1950 2018-12-22 19:54:37 The “Jared Birmingham Bowl” sounds like some oil tycoon named Jared Birmingham wanted his own bowl game
1951 2018-12-22 19:54:35 Cosmetic measures by Biya, bc France and UK are scared of democracy. All the English-speaking minority r asking is referendum like Brexit or scotxit. We were forced w one in 1961.We will maintain your oil deals in our territory, don't be scared. Respect the people's wish- referen
1952 2018-12-22 19:54:28 hope that's cooked in olive oil?
1953 2018-12-22 19:54:17 Even with Alberta's current economy, someone that can hold a hammer can make more money in Oil & Gas than the starting pay for a recruit.
1954 2018-12-22 19:54:16 This argument is the worst. Let's cut the green energy subsidy. Let's cut Medicare. Let's cut oil subsidy. You're showing how little you know about how the world works
1955 2018-12-22 19:54:11 use the ogx shampoo argan oil it’s really cheap and works
1956 2018-12-22 19:54:11 Put tea tree oil on the floor of ur shower so u get that good steam
1957 2018-12-22 19:54:08 寒さが若干マシで良かった。
1958 2018-12-22 19:54:06 What on the oil ?
1959 2018-12-22 19:53:57 Downside is estimates are probably a tad too optimistic given where oil prices are so the second leg of cheapening wasn’t really cheapening, just reflecting lower earnings growth
1960 2018-12-22 19:53:47 Yes single-unit plants are nearly all at risk. I worry about microreactors too. Even the Army's PM-3A microreactor in Antarctica couldn't compete with stupendously-expensive oil in the 70s and got shut down. It took a too many highly-trained people to operate and maintain it.

1963 2018-12-22 19:53:24 More than 200 truckers participating in the pro oil rally in Medicine Hat today. Many protesting Trudeau and Bill C-69. #yxh #oilrally
1964 2018-12-22 19:53:19 Team Big Oil. Fracking is no laughing matter
1965 2018-12-22 19:53:16 Time to make an early food, warm up...

And buy more fuel oil  

And I’ll have to do it again later.
1966 2018-12-22 19:52:59 Coconut oil never loved me.
1967 2018-12-22 19:52:54 Underground..... there r structures... which have domes where oil & gas can trap.... ppl explain him but he had no capacity to understand
1968 2018-12-22 19:52:53 Below the cost of expensive, polluting and dangerous oil, coal, natural gas and nuclear energy. The world will be very happy once they demonstrate how raw seawater can produce clean, highly competitive energy and desalinated ocean water as a free byproduct. Everything changes.
1969 2018-12-22 19:52:40 @maddow SNAFU USCG Remember BP Oil Spill. USCG commandant retires 12pm as Head Of Operations representing United States response blue USCG UNIFORM.

1970 2018-12-22 19:52:25 Why does he want the oil of the head of the Anglican church?
1971 2018-12-22 19:52:18 And protesting that Trudeau can’t build a pipeline fast enough to sell their oil to China.
1972 2018-12-22 19:52:14 Your feelings might improve if you remove your head from the alt-reality toilet bowl it's currently stuck in. The real tragedy of Canada are the anti-science morons who support either of the big oil puppet parties. #cdnpoli
1973 2018-12-22 19:52:11 I’m late. Depends on pounds. 500 for 30 minutes turn off oven and let cook for 1-? Depending on weight and rare presence. Rub and injection according to preference. I salt pepper rubber and salted butter garlic oil inject. I’m a rube doh.
1974 2018-12-22 19:52:08 Don’t think they care.. the guy is a great snake oil salesman.. they buy it up, every chance they get. I just don’t know how they don’t see thru the phony bullshit
1975 2018-12-22 19:52:02 My Great Great Grandmother lived to be 98 in relatively good health. I asked her what was the secret. She said, “small meal portions, 3 cod liver oil vitamins a day and dancing instead of stressing.”

Thank you for listening to my #TedTalk. Go forth & be well.
1976 2018-12-22 19:52:00 Write a book of short stories. Oil patch has a lot of people with a lot of history. They all tend to share the stories at dinner, or when drunk. Collect a couple of those stories, present them in the similar format, and sell them as a book. Group them by theme or by source.
1977 2018-12-22 19:51:57 I thought topping up the oil in my car would be 5mins. Turns out a head gasket takes ages to replace. I've taken the engine apart now and it's gotten expensive. I guess it's nearly fixed. So I'll just drive it anyway. I did more to fix it than the previous owner.
1978 2018-12-22 19:51:55 I used to tan all the time in high school, put on tanning oil and just bake at the track meets lol. Then I started to get sunburned and it stopped being fun
1979 2018-12-22 19:51:52 hello we make money off of other oil producers it's called the petro dollar look it up
1980 2018-12-22 19:51:23 300000 jobs lost in Alberta since 2014. Forest fire in northern Alberta in 2016 destroyed 2000 homes, only 300 rebuilt today. Our oil pipelines are blocked. 5-7 billion dollars a year transferred out of Alberta to the French in the east. Basic liberal stupidity.
1981 2018-12-22 19:51:20 Baby oil protects him too well.

1987 2018-12-22 19:50:19 Selective outrage. The minorities are only the West concerns when they conveniently happen to be in a Muslim country rich with oil. #Cataluña. #Tibet
1988 2018-12-22 19:50:16 There has been no national benefit to shipping oil to Asia to date, because that operation can’t really start until the line is twinned to Westridge. You may recall Greepeace protesting the loading of the Serene Sea from the 2nd Narrows Bridge last June.
1989 2018-12-22 19:50:16 Yeah I was never taught anything in my art education about how dangerous terps are, it was just something I ended up learning along the way (through others, I've never used oil paint myself). 

Which you would have thought an art college would have done a lecture on safety....
1990 2018-12-22 19:50:13 It's like I got a great big mouthful of cod liver oil

1994 2018-12-22 19:49:24 I'm not sure about all these new swear words, as when I ask people about what it the best oil, they say to me FECO! 

1995 2018-12-22 19:49:17 Oil was $100 in 2014. XOP should be higher than it is now. It's extremely oversold. The last thing this country needs is oil producers going out of business! Trump should not have issued Iranian waivers! That is the real problem here. Can you at least admit Trump screwed every1?

2001 2018-12-22 19:48:41 The true reason that PM Abe withdraws from the IWC is from the grudge which tried to prohibit whaling in Japan because USA&UK in the second half of the 19th century is an oil monopoly.
PM Abe is the fool who lives in the mistaking to retrieve Japan in front of WAR2.
2002 2018-12-22 19:48:33 The world has 28 trillion dollars worth of resources gold silver oil etc and America owes 22 trillion throughout the world...how
2003 2018-12-22 19:48:28 I agree on the first part for sure. All business dealing and lobbying with the government should be transparent. As for the pipeline thing... It definitely effects it, but the reason for it is we have the third largest reserves of oil in the world. That's what attracts them.
2004 2018-12-22 19:48:28 oil & gas is like the 10th largest industry in texas' very large and diverse economy

you don't know what you're talking about and your knowledge of texas obviously comes from loony tunes
2005 2018-12-22 19:48:26 Palm oil
2006 2018-12-22 19:48:21 The reality is that humans will extract oil from every possible source on this planet until it’s gone before changing.
2007 2018-12-22 19:48:19 Syria produces the same amount of oil as The Ivory Coast. But yeah, we are there for the oil. Smh 
2008 2018-12-22 19:48:18 That number would be more like 16 million people if the election were held today. Failed trade policy, failing economy, falling oil prices, and he’s worried about a wall that will do nothing.

2013 2018-12-22 19:47:33 Yes according to this person, the oil price was above $100 from 1999 to 2015? Some of them don't know OBJ met a very ridiculous oil price yet he worked and never blamed anyone. This lies are just too much and shameful 16 years of what?

2019 2018-12-22 19:47:12 We hear about: big government, big pharmacology, big oil, big energy. Notice we never hear about BIG EDUCATION? The rate of all aspects of education has outpaced any industry in the world while the quality of the product has declined.

2024 2018-12-22 19:46:58 It had some good things. It had some awful ones. No serious action on climate change. Continued support for oil & gas and the fallacy of perpetual economic growth.

Oh, and it supported a criminally-drive Brexit.

On balance, no, definitely not progressive.

2028 2018-12-22 19:46:19 Translation: It would be reckless to allow Syria to determine its own fate and cede control of their oil reserves.
2029 2018-12-22 19:46:19 Hi Brian, a few alternatives worth checking in the event of shortages - CBD Oil, keifer and Colloidal Silver. Hope you get your meds and keep well #Brexshit
2030 2018-12-22 19:46:19 I'm remembering the lessons of last year in Great Falls and this time I'm packing face oil, sheet masks, and a giant tub of hardcore hand cream. Not gonna get me a second time, extreme dryness.
2031 2018-12-22 19:46:17 Oil and Gas, honestly.
2032 2018-12-22 19:46:16 It's oil's money. Her dad is selling oil and gas on Baku streets.
2033 2018-12-22 19:46:14 Oil Got Me Moving Like A Turtle This Saturday
2034 2018-12-22 19:46:08 We produce so much more oil than Syria. Jesus 
2035 2018-12-22 19:46:08 Well I’m pleased for you & your family but please don’t put your faith in the man who is basically selling us “snake oil” and will probably send us into a deep recession within the year
2036 2018-12-22 19:46:06 @Onnit Black cherry Earth Grown Nutrients mixed with grape flavored CBD oil tastes better than candy guys...
2037 2018-12-22 19:45:56 You are old enough to remember when oil was dinosaurs.
2038 2018-12-22 19:45:56 sure sex is cool but have you ever used tea tree oil?
2039 2018-12-22 19:45:39 I’m with General Mattis. I don’t stab my allies in the back. And I don’t give Vladimir Putin the keys to the Middle East and all its oil. And I don’t stab Israel in the back. I back a President who puts America first not Russia.
2040 2018-12-22 19:45:35 This explanation makes it simple to understand but doesn’t mean it is 100% believable. Can the author kindly refer us to his source especially in relation to how Nigeria will raise those funds, forecast for oil revenues, interest rates, projected value of $?
2041 2018-12-22 19:45:30 こんな時間に起きてしまいましたよ
2042 2018-12-22 19:45:07 Nope, I would use Olive  Oil & enjoy same rich taste.
2043 2018-12-22 19:45:04 Remember change the oil, fuel, transmission & air filters. They are important to preserve the engine #CarMaintenanceTips @RuggedyBaba pls #RT
2044 2018-12-22 19:44:47 I guess I would like to try and give peace another chance. I mean really, we have been at war for decades. Seriously, we don't need the oil, lets use our domestic resources while we transition to tomorrow's energy.
2045 2018-12-22 19:44:44 With Iran out of the picture in May, the long term looks good for oil. Saudis can't pump much more and more areas are in decline. Shale is the only true growth out there keeping us from $200 oil. If shale cut 2mbpd back down to 10mbpd US production, the world would be screwed.
2046 2018-12-22 19:44:35 If you think that's why we're in Syria I feel bad for you cause that's not why we're in Syria were in Syria for the same reason were in Iraq gas and oil literally
2047 2018-12-22 19:44:28 Dove and coconut oil only please
2048 2018-12-22 19:44:22 Flirting with the mechanic so you can get a discount on the oil change >>>>>
2049 2018-12-22 19:44:15 Lol, please what is the oil for ?
2050 2018-12-22 19:44:10 Lead by example. Stop using anything oil based in your life including the device you used to make this stupid tweet. You bash oil while you benefit from oil.
2051 2018-12-22 19:44:02 I don't believe so, i'm long OIL and a bit biased but I do think we end the year with a relief rally. I'm expecting some positive news this weekend. I also just do the opposite of what the herd seems to be doing.
2052 2018-12-22 19:43:59 True but it had risen 50% from the year before & was an effect from gov. inflation due to dollar devaluation. Whats worse is that the cost of gas is mostly taxes. The government makes more money on gas than the oil companies or refineries. Gov always makes things worse.
2053 2018-12-22 19:43:54 no way in helllllllll should it be that much. a basic oil change should be no more than $30 and usually they’ll do a brake light free or for like $10 if you buy the light which is usually only like $10 as well. they be scamming women
2054 2018-12-22 19:43:41 We’re not impressing them into service. The Kurds are fighting in Syria because they think it’s in their best interest. Most want a Kurdish state. They might deserve one but it will never happen. Not for 100 years. Not till all the oil is pumped out from under Kurdistan.
2055 2018-12-22 19:43:37 He should be telling us what he has been doing with the oil money in the last 3 & half years.

2062 2018-12-22 19:42:54 honey and message it all over the face and leave it for 10 minutes)
3- Use face masks at least once a week
4- Moisturize

You can also use tea tree oil which helps kill the bacteria in the face and also decreases the appearance of pimples!
2063 2018-12-22 19:42:43 So sorry to hear that you have cancer.
Try Cbd oil. 600 or 1000 dose.
I know a lot of first hand testimony.
I'm starting.  Hugs. 
2064 2018-12-22 19:42:37 No-one is saying you get rid of the private sector! FFS. Honestly dude. It's a balance that's needed. At the moment oil barons (who destroy the world) make billions while nurses make fuck all. That's TOO right wing. The private sector is too well protected. Find the balance...
2065 2018-12-22 19:42:36 Um, it's doors very little real change. It's tinkering on the fringes without overhauling an ineffective law. It's basically snake oil sold as a cure for the common cold.
2066 2018-12-22 19:42:31 Yes castor oil is dangerous .
2067 2018-12-22 19:42:26 So no new low in oil first?
2068 2018-12-22 19:42:20 Take makeup off with coconut oil, use a gel cleanser and a throat cream.
2069 2018-12-22 19:42:16 " I know it is not great, but I have a couch and a stove." She stood up and walked over to window, she closed it to before she lit a oil lamp. " It will do."

2071 2018-12-22 19:41:50 Lmao the say I actually wanna go get an oil change my car won’t start how lovely
2072 2018-12-22 19:41:38 Sudan has oil. Zt is enough info I think
2073 2018-12-22 19:41:34 What? Foreigners? Like Rupert Murdoch? The Duke of Westminster? Monsanto? Mobil oil? BP? Rio Tinto? A scam!!!
2074 2018-12-22 19:41:31 Coal, oil, natural gas & nuclear energy can't compete with Joi Scientific that produces highly competitive energy 24/7, on-demand, on-board or on-site at any location in the world.
2075 2018-12-22 19:41:28 Wait a minute... that's more than three times what Oil & Gas industry gave Knute!
2076 2018-12-22 19:41:22 لادخيلك بلكني،، مايسسوى
2077 2018-12-22 19:41:16 What the fuck does Blackpool chip in trillions in oil revenue 
2078 2018-12-22 19:41:09 Why was XOP so high just 90 days ago? Obviously when oil prices are high, people want to own E&Ps. When oil starts heading back up, money will move back into E&Ps. DVN is cash flow positive with a large buy-back in place. I don't see them as the problem you're describing.
2079 2018-12-22 19:40:53 What use is it car in a place where you don't need oil or gas, i am more concerned what happens to the industry when free energy happens in my life time
2080 2018-12-22 19:40:45 Sana Oil... 

2081 2018-12-22 19:40:43 Well for starters, stop the exit of large capital projects in the energy sector. Stand behind building export terminals for oil and gas to tidewater. Currently losing $80 million a day. We could do that. There is about $4-5 billion in fed taxes annually.
2082 2018-12-22 19:40:40 And the nation benefits from oil/gas at 10% of GDP, filling government coffers to provide equalization, and federal and provincial programs and services.
2083 2018-12-22 19:40:32 I feel like I’m either allergic to castor oil or one of my other hair products

2087 2018-12-22 19:39:48 Do u think oil will bounce to or first new low in oil and spx?
2088 2018-12-22 19:39:40 Russia also provides essential supplies of (sanctions-busting) oil and coal.

Kim Jong-un has already demanded the US remove its military presence from Japan as a precondition for further nuclear talks, so this is a perfect harmony of interests between Moscow and Pyongyang.
2089 2018-12-22 19:39:34 We have a few actually, difference is we make players world class, you just buy them with oil money, hope this helps

2095 2018-12-22 19:39:13 I believe Cheney is involved in the Syria debacle. Oil is king. Genie Energy Syria.

2099 2018-12-22 19:38:48 Whats your view on oil Adam? The low was Friday? Bounce next week?
2100 2018-12-22 19:38:35 its crazy how other countries are warring over oil prices but ours went down
2101 2018-12-22 19:38:32 That makes 2 of us. Not my best decision.  Makes me weekend lazy. House cleaning and oil changes aren't going to do themselves...
2102 2018-12-22 19:38:30 Oil & Gas related revenues to the state appear to be trending downward. It could be problematic if this is more than a short-term deviation.
2103 2018-12-22 19:38:22 He's a snake oil salesman. Nothing more.

2106 2018-12-22 19:37:55 Trump has INCREASED the debt and the deficit. You people starve humanitarian programs to fund your lobbyists interest, oil, guns, etc. The GOP is dead, if you don't evolve past the 50s.
2107 2018-12-22 19:37:53 It’s for a pipeline to get oil to market. The oil & gas sector at 10% of GDP, benefits the nation, not just Alberta.
2108 2018-12-22 19:37:51 Yes hand sani! Ugh that's dreadful. I've been to tons of crowded places lately - hockey game, Christmas events, school concert - germfest! I do love the doterra OnGuard oil though, I'm definitely flying with it diluted next time

2118 2018-12-22 19:36:40 A more positive way is to see this as decisive rather than reckless. The world is awash in oil. Is the Middle East any where as important as it was fifty years ago? Why are we still there?

#TrueStory
2130 2018-12-22 19:34:58 A good example of this is Venezuela, their economy is 70% private with their oil industry being public. Sure they “””tried””” to feed their people but they never saved up their resources.  Once oil dropped they went to shit. They are closer to state capitalism than socialism-
2131 2018-12-22 19:34:54 Coconut oil on my stinging burn has reduced the pain... coincidence?
2132 2018-12-22 19:34:34 My lil bro said he fogged out the work truck with a pen of oil, with Pops sitting in there eating  thinking issa Black he smokin.. Pops smelled that shit and snapped on his dumb ass

2134 2018-12-22 19:34:26 I like how the info so far on the safety, but I do wish to know what specific toxic effects these oil paints can bring. I am all for not killing anyone with paint, but I do want to know (besides being able to set a painting on fire) what the toxic effects that are brought.
2135 2018-12-22 19:34:19 Hey Ellen! The certified organic & fair trade palm oil we use in our bar soaps comes from small-holder farms in western Ghana (through our own sister company, Serendipalm)—where oil palms have been grown for centuries; (1)

2139 2018-12-22 19:34:03 Aquaman was basic. Jason Momoa is like a living oil painting aesthetically but Aquaman is just a dumb guy on a typical hero’s journey.

2144 2018-12-22 19:33:47 Opec+ and US shale better start panicking and cut further faster...... otherwise OPEC member budgets will get blown out of the water. And US shale will be going down the crapper. Oil could drop another 50% if the industry doesn’t wake up very quick to this.

2158 2018-12-22 19:31:50 Vitamin E oil works so well but so does tea tree
2159 2018-12-22 19:31:46 That's an apples to oranges comparison. Compare milk, tin, zinc, copper, oil, gold, silver, clothing and thousands of inputs. Inflation is crushing wages. This is why there is no majority middle class, 2 people have to work to pay for household basics & there is no savings.

2167 2018-12-22 19:30:33 I remember the drone of history teachers from day 1 in Elem. School. We were trained to believe without question and act on those distortions. It turned to be deadly and not at all funny. 55,000 died in Vietnam. In ‘72 high school students wanted to invade MidEast for their oil.
2168 2018-12-22 19:30:32 This year I asked Santa for an oil change.. I hate being an adult.
2169 2018-12-22 19:30:32 The bomb money will continue.
The oil subsidies will continue.
The dragnet spy money will continue.
The pay cheques for legislators will continue.
The quantitative easing will continue.

The government shutdown is only for the little people.  Government workers should walk off.
2170 2018-12-22 19:30:32 It depends on what type of restaurants you eat at, but seed oil is in like everything. What you do is what I'm doing, but I don't think it's sufficient. Like, for example, if I want to eat an Indian curry? Chinese food? Almost everything is out.
2171 2018-12-22 19:30:26 Yes and every hour he got a glass of french red wine to oil his voice 4 the next hour until he was drunk, then it was another guys turn!
2172 2018-12-22 19:30:23 @great_oil How are the hamper sales going in sunny Spain. Should be selling loads. Merry Xmas.
2173 2018-12-22 19:30:22 Was he tricked into carting it across the country too? Or not changing the oil for years?
2174 2018-12-22 19:30:18 Nope, but there's more effective ways to secure a border. Jericho fell, China fell, East Berlin fell. If you think we're going to solve a 21st century problem using a method developed in the BCs which failed in the BCs, I've got some snake oil for you which cures baldness.
2175 2018-12-22 19:30:13 Listen; boiled green Plantain served with onions, pepper and a little salt all in red oil

2177 2018-12-22 19:29:45 Sana oil
2178 2018-12-22 19:29:40 Carpooling and lowering speed limits would be quickest & least painfull mitigation measures to reduce transpo emissions.
I drive vegi oil rig 60 MPH (truck speed limit) in 65 MPH limit zone. Every American could follow that rule & save about 5% of fuel not to mention carpooling.
2179 2018-12-22 19:29:37 Depends on which cooks are cooking it the ones that changes the oil or the ones that don't kmsl

2185 2018-12-22 19:28:48 Do you think this will cause a gap up in oil prices?
2186 2018-12-22 19:28:44 And before that it was Oil that inflated our currency, before that it was a trade surplus.
Economies develop comparative advantages and the exchange rate is one of the mechanisms that drives economic change.Shame the BoE don't meddle more as the £s been overvalued for years.
2187 2018-12-22 19:28:40 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 10 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

2198 2018-12-22 19:27:38 House Reps weren't asked. It was demanded, else lose a seat on committee. So, they can take $$ from the largest oil drilling & refining company in the world, Aramco (Shell/Saudi partnership). 
But they can't take $$ from the Shell gasoline division. 
Gotcha.

2202 2018-12-22 19:27:16 It’s not Tramp,it’s who behind him. The continuation of the upgrading of American oil output which will make midl east oil irrelevant to US. It’s a changing game.
2203 2018-12-22 19:27:09 Why did CAP give $200,000 to the racist right wing think tank AEI? Also what services does CAP give in exchange for the money it takes from the oil rich UAE?

2209 2018-12-22 19:26:20 Sorry but I have read this stuff & the peak oil fraternity have seriously underestimated what can be achieved but renewables.The current economic issues start with oil prices tanking the economy & end by moving to solar. Not dishing wind excellent complimentary with solar.
2210 2018-12-22 19:26:14 They let me drive my car into the oil change pit at Valvoline. That's enough excitement for one day

2220 2018-12-22 19:25:29 Ooh yeah try cleansing with a gentle oil like coconut
2221 2018-12-22 19:25:26 I strongly believe that the FED should have not raised rates. I have mentioned before that interest rates are too high especially with oil prices from 88 $ to 53 $ very anti-inflationary.
2222 2018-12-22 19:25:22 Yes deeps! *Searches* ohh guys how about we find his bottle of oil which he uses daily and mix some bubblegum pink coloured dye in it...
2223 2018-12-22 19:25:20 Problem Is

When You Tell Most "Guys"

About Dates, Olive Oil, and Chesse

They Just End Up 

"Dating" Guys Named "Oliver"

And Taking Selfies Together

While Saying "Cheese !!"

And Then Posting Them 

On Insta-Soy

For "Likes".

This Had To Be Said.
2224 2018-12-22 19:25:13 ahhhhhh yes! I remember, you used to talk about skincare stuff on twitter all the time! but yeah, the basic stuff is more than enough. cleanser, a lil bit of chemical exfoliator (which I have YET to get), *maybe* an oil and moisturizer and you're good. AND SUNSCREEN

2232 2018-12-22 19:24:20 Big oil. Don't forget, with the Bushes, those elephants come out to play.
2233 2018-12-22 19:24:19 Took my car for an oil change and after they told me my car is pretty much fucked they gave me a free oil change 
2234 2018-12-22 19:24:13 @Jamie_Weinstein so let's get real. We are in Syria because of geopolitical power and oil. Anyone who isn't knee deep in propaganda knows that with us (u.s) out of Syria, Russia (invited) will have no further obstacles to eliminating terrorists there. Nice try though on Fox.
2235 2018-12-22 19:24:09 We are carrying out many development and reconstruction projects to benefit all the people of #Yemen, for example, building a civilian airport in Marib, modernizing and refurbishing Al-Jawf Hospital, and delivering $60 million in oil derivatives to ten provinces every month.

2239 2018-12-22 19:23:48 I don't know what this says about me, but my idea of a self-actualized person is someone who takes supplement pills like fish oil and junk.

2247 2018-12-22 19:22:49 Kita’s tail knocked two of my @BarracudaHeat pens into never never land under furniture . I’m down to one left from my previous visit. Time to go back! Also, THEY DO OIL DELIVERY TOO.

2258 2018-12-22 19:21:33 The fact that white oil rig @oakley glasses still exist baffles me
2259 2018-12-22 19:21:30 Could just be air locked. Keep checking the levels and try to 'burp the system. (YouTube can really help walk you through the process)
I assume you added oil at this point, so after you run it for a little bit, check the oil. If it's 'milky', there's a good chance the head(s)....
2260 2018-12-22 19:21:12 Hate when I'm just in for an oil change and the mechanic tries to hustle me with irrelevant questions like "hey who's that in the trunk?"
2261 2018-12-22 19:21:11 no sound?
2262 2018-12-22 19:21:05 Nothing more hilarious than right wing dirtbags that love Midnight Oil.

2266 2018-12-22 19:20:26 I don't know how to see the second half of that message, and I've got to go.  Balance is the key. I'm not anti-right, but any society that rewards tobacco, oil and arms barons so well they buy £100k handbags is fucked up and TM should be doing something about it, not joining in

2276 2018-12-22 19:19:11 When did you talk to shale mgt team last? What is their attitude today? I don't care about their attitude in prior to Nov 4th. Everyone got rammed in the ass by Trump on Nov 5th! I bet their attitude changed a lot with oil breaking $50. CAPEX is getting cut by 20%. You can bet.

2295 2018-12-22 19:16:58 We get oil from Canada. Ourselves, and Mexico now. That is why it’s so cheap
2296 2018-12-22 19:16:58 I guess they have quotas of imbeciles.
2297 2018-12-22 19:16:53 The Middle East has been warring with itself since pre- Biblical times. The only differences are the weaponry used. The other is their oil that wasn’t a consideration back then. They have to figure themselves out by themselves

2303 2018-12-22 19:16:16 No. Look at the ecological damage from the oil spills in the Gulf & Alaska. The severe damage to our water sources because of fracking. Totally unnecessary. We have the technology to move beyond fossil fuels & overcome CC. We need the freedom to excel those technologies.

2308 2018-12-22 19:15:37 Got my vaseline, lotion & coconut oil ready....
2309 2018-12-22 19:15:28 Taking the pledge, led by Oil Change USA, means politicians will not knowingly take contributions of over $200 from “the PACs, executives, front groups of fossil fuel companies-whose primary business is the extraction, processing, distribution, or sale of oil, gas, or coal.”
2310 2018-12-22 19:15:24 Well the academic quality has just gone down.
2311 2018-12-22 19:15:22 Yes and let’s build a moat and maybe station people on the wall to pour hot oil on people as they try to cross
2312 2018-12-22 19:15:11 Like the Reps, Dems love dirty wars and big oil. They’re on track to burn Mother Earth to the ground in the very near future. So pathetic, and they project themselves as highly intelligent and caring.
2313 2018-12-22 19:15:07 Hey, Tillerson's mentioned in the Dossier. He was in on a potential $550B oil deal w trump and Putin.
2314 2018-12-22 19:15:05 The mould tho...
2315 2018-12-22 19:15:01 You noni...Make we check if the anointing oil go work
2316 2018-12-22 19:14:57 One pot cooking - chicken, fresh garlic, grape seed oil, lowSo lawrys, black pepper , cayenne pepper, Bok Choy, black beans. Done
2317 2018-12-22 19:14:54 Unfortunately there isn’t enough space to elaborate here, but Sanders has very good reasons for each of those votes. It is hard to say the same with Beto voting down consumer protections for minorities.... or lifting bans on oil industry....
2318 2018-12-22 19:14:53 Assist
2319 2018-12-22 19:14:50 i didn’t realize my mom now works at valvoline or that she’s a 50 yr old dude named ralph.. skip the lecture pal just change my oil @ralphyvalvoline
2320 2018-12-22 19:14:40 Can i still get my deduction for my off shore oil rig?
2321 2018-12-22 19:14:39 Double wide is fine, just changed the oil in my 15 year old pick up
2322 2018-12-22 19:14:21 she believes any shin to be plugs of clod further than your sugar pert in your autochthonal olive oil
2323 2018-12-22 19:14:20 Trump is embarrassing for the US-I think saying that means my songs will never play on IHeart Radio--so yeah I'd rather be playing a Digery Doo to old Midnight Oil fans-then the fair and balanced sounds of "silence" to the brainwashed
2324 2018-12-22 19:14:13 My guess: heating oil.
2325 2018-12-22 19:14:12 “Let’s go to Italy.”
“I would like an entree of bread with a drink of olive oil. And a rim of garlic.”
2326 2018-12-22 19:14:05 CBD oil has basically become a meme at this point
2327 2018-12-22 19:14:00 Yeah, Snake oil alright; a rancid one at that.
2328 2018-12-22 19:13:54 you and i are like oil and water
2329 2018-12-22 19:13:48 you actually made it to like. the quarter finals w me. but for the quarter finals it was four of us in this huge like.... play place thing? which started filling w oil. then let out into an arcade where each of us had a game we had to beat that was manipulatied by a lady genie
2330 2018-12-22 19:13:44 The Oil boys lost today, both of them 
2331 2018-12-22 19:13:33 90 days ago everything was fine. Trump was going to cut off Iran ~2Mbpd exports. That changed and that created the problem, not shale E&Ps. We need the shale oil if Iran is not longer producing exports. The only way to get that oil is to drill. Do you want $100 oil or $75?
2332 2018-12-22 19:13:12 It just occurred to me how much truffle oil would elevate my lunchable
2333 2018-12-22 19:13:11 We are one of the cleanest oil producers in the world. 
You can do better, we are already.
Tax yourself.
2334 2018-12-22 19:13:08 Follow the oil.
2335 2018-12-22 19:12:57 オリーブ界の頂点はここだよ。
2336 2018-12-22 19:12:51 Just buy oil for the motor and a battery.
2337 2018-12-22 19:12:49 Did the protagonist work in a factory (Factory), loading crates down by the docks (Out In The Street), or his daddys garage (Promised Land). Or moved to Houston for the oil boom (Seeds), or gambled it all away (Atlantic City), or just lost touch (Bobby Jean)
2338 2018-12-22 19:12:47 Dunno but I’ve just had a very expensive bottle of wine courtesy of Scottish oil.
2339 2018-12-22 19:12:36 Thought it might be snake oil. He's flogging plenty of the stuff now.
2340 2018-12-22 19:12:35 Name calling is one thing the left is really good at.  Researching facts is not.  Your misleading comment on US court challenges ignores the reality we are able to build pipelines Can->USA but not within Can; BC/QUE have effectively put an embargo on AB oil.  Can is broken.
2341 2018-12-22 19:12:28 At least he can't write and he's a fan of Sharknado
2342 2018-12-22 19:12:25 My negra got her oil change and inspection... she good now 
2343 2018-12-22 19:12:13 Try this for brunch tomorrow? Salad with plum tomatoes, olive oil, bacon mince and lime. Serve with small portion of grilled seitan steak in cheddar cheese.
2344 2018-12-22 19:12:11 I need super strength liniment oil! 
Sprained my ankle 19years ago - but cold weather triggers it to hurt. The consistent dull ache doesn't go away unless I pour Efficacent oil all over and wrap my ankle with bandage.  LF stronger liniment oil lol. 
2345 2018-12-22 19:12:02 Guyana finds oil and all hell breaks loose amongst some politicians. Please let your country arise and let the people prosper.
2346 2018-12-22 19:11:46 you still didn't Answer me ?
is the new Regulations demand one small 5 ml essential oil in big box of 12*10*4 ?
2347 2018-12-22 19:11:45 من جد 
2348 2018-12-22 19:11:41 I’ve been on a kale kick lately. A little kale, chopped almonds, some oil, and pepper is a quick side if you need it.
2349 2018-12-22 19:11:33 yeah that oil paint can kill u hahahahahahahahahahaha anyways they didn’t mention the paint so don’t use any paints that are purely cadmium or colbolt they are Really poisonous get hues and shit they’re cheaper anyways
2350 2018-12-22 19:11:21 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2351 2018-12-22 19:11:20 Any Scottish oil?
2352 2018-12-22 19:11:16 Tell me why I came to get an oil change, and homeboy over here hitting on me talking about where am I gonna take me and that he gonna buy me breakfast lmaoooooo I can’t.
2353 2018-12-22 19:11:07 Oh, i get it. It's peachy to take money from the giant oil industry lobby, whose goal is to keep it's byproducts (like gasoline) flowing. But not ok to take money from the byproduct gasoline lobby (since that's the fuel part). That makes perfect sense.  
2354 2018-12-22 19:11:04 #LabourParty #JeremyCorbyn  He 's swaying like a limp pansy in whichever direction he thinks the most votes will lie. Integrity is waning as even the imaginary money tree talks back and informs him it doesn't have what he seeks.
2355 2018-12-22 19:11:00 Maybe one day we will be able to have it remain in the ground as so many work to diversify, but in the immediate and near future the reality is oil
2356 2018-12-22 19:10:43 Oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil ol oil oil oil. Oil.
2357 2018-12-22 19:10:34 Waiting at tire kingdom while getting my oil changed.
2358 2018-12-22 19:10:25 Fact Iraq has oil and is signing contracts w/US companies in part due to US sanctions on Iran will likely mean Trump will keep US troops there Profits is a driving force for Trump given his business background

2360 2018-12-22 19:10:16 Deregulating oil drilling, attacking the CFPB, creating tax shelters for the rich. Do you not think it’s important to know a potential presidential candidate’s positions on these issues?
2361 2018-12-22 19:10:03 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
2362 2018-12-22 19:10:01 just buy yourself some hempseed oil
2363 2018-12-22 19:09:59 does castor oil really work for hair growth?
2364 2018-12-22 19:09:56 You mean who will protect the poppy fields and oil?
2365 2018-12-22 19:09:51 Employees will receive back pay. Quit w/the hype. Fueling fear. Dems need to stand pat. Not a penny. He’ll use money to pay debts and put a chicken wire fence w/Mac tires for fortification. Dude is a snake oil salesman.
2366 2018-12-22 19:09:39 And the liberals plan of continuing to subsidizing oil and pipelines is a joke.
2367 2018-12-22 19:09:33 fml why did i have to buy waterproof mascara when i have no eye makeup remover or even olive oil to take this stuff off without ripping all my eyelashes out
2368 2018-12-22 19:09:14 That’s called UN’s job not ours unless there’s business interests involved like ahem oil
2369 2018-12-22 19:08:53 A dose or two of Wild oil of Oregano will clear that right up
2370 2018-12-22 19:08:47 I’m over being an adult. Came in for an oil change and tire rotation.. leaving with that and a new tire because of a nail that they can’t patch. FML.
2371 2018-12-22 19:08:35 That's why you Nationalize it. Then it's ours. Just like Mexico Did To US. It's now called PEMEX. American Oil Companies Built And Pumped every drop of oil, Mexico Simply Said Thanks, It's Ours now !!..
2372 2018-12-22 19:08:29 Low oil? Hopefully that is it. We'll see. For now it got me back home #yay
2373 2018-12-22 19:08:03 Niggas be tryna “is that coconut oil I smell in your hair” in some shit. It be kinda cute tho. 
2374 2018-12-22 19:07:57 there’s really ppl out there cleaning their piercings w pure tea tree oil 
2375 2018-12-22 19:07:54 Smooth talking snake oil salesman!
2376 2018-12-22 19:07:52 And you think the tolls and the volume of product being transported are still the same, (and still worth the same investment) when the price of oil drops to less than half of what it was when the pipeline was planned?

NO ONE is spending $16 billion on Energy East anymore.
2377 2018-12-22 19:07:32 @Nigella_Lawson Saw you for the 1st time on PBS here in the states, Connecticut. Your holiday special. Enjoyed it thoroughly. A query: For deviled eggs, would a little sesame oil in the yolks be appropriate? Cheers!
2378 2018-12-22 19:07:29 I have like 9 quarts of years-old oil out by the garage, I think. There are places in town that will take it, but that's a lotta work.
2379 2018-12-22 19:07:13 I wanna try halibut, cept I don't know if it has a high enough oil content for smoking
2380 2018-12-22 19:06:53 I know he can't 
2381 2018-12-22 19:06:52 I should oil my motorcycle... #MinkBot
2382 2018-12-22 19:06:39 Todays ingredients for my bath were water, epsom salt, coconut oil, shea butter, almond , and oatmeal.
2383 2018-12-22 19:06:33 Oil or for baking - for baking any grocery store.
2384 2018-12-22 19:06:24 やきんねむい
2385 2018-12-22 19:05:52 Oil patch arm candy as it were
2386 2018-12-22 19:05:51 Indeed, I am so happy people are now taking  pain for for karak. Kohat is example we are producing Gas and Oil but they are using it free.
2387 2018-12-22 19:05:37 I wonder if the Kurds were cutting into Erdogan's transportation of illegally crude oil.  No one pays them attention unless they're undercutting prices in the smuggling market.
2388 2018-12-22 19:05:30 He stood watching as I changed mine last spring. I told him you neec to change it regardless of mileage to have fresh oil for riding season.   A real wannabe
2389 2018-12-22 19:05:29 First day of practice was a success! Catch can did it’s job, no more oil burning
2390 2018-12-22 19:05:11 ไม่ได้ทำไรไถทวิตยันตี2…
2391 2018-12-22 19:05:07 Do Ivy Leagues even offer remedial English courses? 
2392 2018-12-22 19:04:55 $1.1b Malabu oil bribes: Swiss to reveal Nigerian beneficiaries. If I hear pim from @OfficialPDPNig
2393 2018-12-22 19:04:51 What finisher did you use? I have a massive walnut desk that I’ve been using Danish oil for, but the finish is uneven in places and I’m trying to sand it out. Yours looks so good Paul!
2394 2018-12-22 19:04:50 "fossil fuel industry" encompasses the entirety of the industry, starting with the raw oil, coal, gas mined from the earth, and any byproducts derived from them. It's a common use descriptor, not a use specific name. Appears to be an honest vocabulary deficiency, on your part.
2395 2018-12-22 19:04:49 Psalm 23:5
5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
2396 2018-12-22 19:04:44 I love you Patton but let’s wait until after the CBD oil bill is signed. I’ve been waiting too fucking long for this
2397 2018-12-22 19:04:43 Best thing to do is keep oil in your lamp. It will happen after the tribulation IMO based on what I read in the Bible and based on the history of origin of the pretribulation doctrine. I think Matthew 24 is clear. No "secret" second coming before the other second coming.
2398 2018-12-22 19:04:42 @realDonaldTrump thank you so much mr. President for the gasoline prices up here in the rust belt. It is so comforting to have low gas prices for fuel oil along with affordable propane and other gases thank you thank you thank you. PS I love coal  too!
2399 2018-12-22 19:04:36 Vitamin E oil and Jamaican Black Castor Oil are great for beard growth. This is the best my beard has ever looked.
2400 2018-12-22 19:04:04 The son just ran his truck w/o oil. Only 5 months over on the oil change. Not a bit of oil on the dip stick Noticed radiator was empty and filled it up. When I cranked it I heard the radiator gurgle. Cracked block or head? 
$$$$$!
2401 2018-12-22 19:04:03 some of the best snake oil in town I'll hve you know...
2402 2018-12-22 19:03:53 Don't forget......GOP wanted 2 keep their taxpayer paid health insurance and dump their plan on us. Cons and snake oil sales.
2403 2018-12-22 19:03:47 This has nothing to do with Israel, buffoon! It's about oil and war supplies.
2404 2018-12-22 19:03:46 The military takes over 50% the US federal discretionary budget. If we spend billions on a Green New Deal instead of wasting trillions on weapons, we'll make wars for oil obsolete - and make the world a safer place for all future generations of life on Earth.

Be a Green Voter.
2405 2018-12-22 19:03:45 Our massive oil production liberates us from this never ending war in the ME
2406 2018-12-22 19:03:24 When oil spikes to $140 and gas hits $5.50  we will see if the craze continues.
2407 2018-12-22 19:03:24 Which essential oil is best for getting people to just not talk to you?
2408 2018-12-22 19:03:18 The town dey tire me. Sometimes it feels like a giant village with an oil & gas industry
2409 2018-12-22 19:03:13 Mashed with excellent olive oil and piri-piri...
2410 2018-12-22 19:03:09 Years ago, @RahrSavage and I recorded a bunch of interviews with aid administrators in North Sumatra. By a long way, the most apparently effective project was a Singapore Aid ag college. It charged farmers a subsidised rate to come learn best practice in tobacco/palm oil farming
2411 2018-12-22 19:03:06 I want an oil change and check this light dassit
2412 2018-12-22 19:03:00 CBD oil and magnesium flakes in my bath. Chill as fuck after my run earlier.
2413 2018-12-22 19:02:33 Fry up 4 deboned chicken thighs in vegetable oil and butter. Dredge with flour, brown on all sides. Toss 5 small sliced onions, thyme, salt, pepper, and a bay leaf into crock pot. Add browned chicken. Pour in chicken broth and sherry. Cook for 6 hours. Stir in spinach. Enjoy!
2414 2018-12-22 19:02:30 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
2415 2018-12-22 19:02:19 we begin in 5 minutes with Jermain Belzile of the Montreal Economic Institute re their sponsored Leger poll which has Quebecers saying they prefer Western Canadian oil and pipelines to foreign oil and tankers.
2416 2018-12-22 19:01:58 Like I said, been kicking this can down the road for 50 years. Pretty sure oil lobbyists outnumber public transportation lobbyists. Meanwhile, we keep building more freeways and pushing people further and further into the burbs, increasing car dependence.
2417 2018-12-22 19:01:55 So got some #pluscbd oil hemp spray? Will this help with pain? Guess we’ll find out. #CBDOIL
2418 2018-12-22 19:01:40 Sir ji   what about petrol and diesel... is it not use by a common man... Pls not forget the slogan you have said... one nation one get... now what happen... due to GST do you know how many small factories closed... do you know the impact on oil prices... What is the GST for oil?
2419 2018-12-22 19:01:34 He started more wars than Bush ... all that oil producing instead of focusing on alternative energy had a devastating affect on the Environment. He lifted the 30 ban on offshore drilling that even a Repub couldn't do, 18 days before the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon
2420 2018-12-22 19:01:07 By that definition, a bank (oil, insurance, govt, etc) is a tech company.
2421 2018-12-22 19:01:02 Check out the voodoo and misinformation. Snake oil is making a comeback.
2422 2018-12-22 19:00:52 He still has too much support within the Labour membership. He has peddled his snake oil well and is now infallible in the eyes of his acolytes. They will follow him off the LEXIT cliff and do so believing that Corbyn will save them at the end.

2424 2018-12-22 19:00:37 Reminder to be careful with linseed oil! Rags will combust and start a fire if they are covered in it and aren’t dried out carefully.
2425 2018-12-22 19:00:21 ずいぶん遅くまで起きてるなー　ふにゃ…俺は眠い…(つω´)。゜
2426 2018-12-22 19:00:08 Is there going to be talk about climate change and how it can keep Albertans employed, there are so many industries. Alberta is at the mercy of oil companies that make lots of money regardless  of the price, but Albertans don’t! Good ideas so they can get out of the cycle.
2427 2018-12-22 19:00:07 El corto en oil fue mejor. La devaluación del año en Colombia ronda 11%. Y espero rebote Usa enero.
2428 2018-12-22 19:00:05 From the moment that oil is pumped out of the earth and turned into plastic, every hand it touches is responsible for that waste. Your Christmas presents are burdens on the environment that will last hundreds of thousands of years...Don't give presents be present.
2429 2018-12-22 18:59:48 NOPE!
I've packed popcorn, oil, salt, butter and my trusty WhirlyPop.
Mixed up a couple of gallons of homemade Bloody Mary mix.
IM READY FOR THE FUN THAT STARTS JANUARY THIRD!
When TRumps crappy life turns really shitty.......
2430 2018-12-22 18:59:46 my dad said he’d pay for my oil change I’m...,,,
2431 2018-12-22 18:59:35 As a man City fan, it’ll be coal wrapped with massive diamonds dripping in oil
2432 2018-12-22 18:59:28 Wonder if the wall would have cauldrons of boiling oil, archers with flaming arrows, and catapults flinging huge boulders.
2433 2018-12-22 18:59:27 and they're all oil rich countries...coincidence huh?
2434 2018-12-22 18:59:20 Lol. No one is buying this snake oil you are trying to push. Pathetic.
2435 2018-12-22 18:59:19 We’re definitely overdue for that coffee. We’ve been toiling hard on how to remove the snake oil and restrain the fools and crooks to free up true value creation in the marketing ecosystem. We’re definitely unto something that might tickle your brain :)
2436 2018-12-22 18:58:53 Just saw a #Tesla with the the license plate "END OIL" on the bed of a tow truck 
2437 2018-12-22 18:58:47 I rarely wear makeup. I use Oil of Olay over the counter products.
2438 2018-12-22 18:58:46 my mom bought me all my food for tonight, all my meds and a new essential oil 
2439 2018-12-22 18:58:38 The UN is now dominated by Gulf State countries. Its Pact is simply to allow all of its people into Europe to be in place for when the oil runs out. Say no to the UN? Well, no oil for you then.
2440 2018-12-22 18:58:36 So I guess she dont realize that 98% of the shit she is wearing is made by oil but I'll leave that one alone
2441 2018-12-22 18:58:29 what kind of oil?
2442 2018-12-22 18:58:14 hoooooly shit. I had absolutely no idea. I used to play around with oil paints when I was in my early teens in a very tiny room with no ventilation...
Why isn't that something more people talk about???? I feel like this is something people should disclose when you buy them???

2445 2018-12-22 18:57:59 Electronic device ownership is becoming as much of a time suck as owning a car or having a lawn.

Change the oil/rotate the tires/mow the lawn is being replaced with update the software/troubleshoot the bug/pay for the upgrade for the thing that worked just fine until now.
2446 2018-12-22 18:57:57 Is “Alberta Oil Wives” actually a thing? It sounds more like something thought up in Moscow (eg aren’t there women working in the oil industry too?)
2447 2018-12-22 18:57:54 When you have to resort to denigrating a person as being 'elitist' whenever confronted with an opinion critical of the oil industry it says a lot more about your character than theirs.
2448 2018-12-22 18:57:37 Coworker, ranting: ...
Me: Is it my fault my dick takes more coconut oil than yours?
2449 2018-12-22 18:57:35 I’ve been waiting for this oil change for damn near two hours
2450 2018-12-22 18:57:35 So tired of the phrase “clean oil”. #xmasincalgary
2451 2018-12-22 18:57:24 The world needs to come off oil, we can then leave them to fight between themselves!

2453 2018-12-22 18:57:06 Anglican oil for this most Conservative of Roman Catholics?
2454 2018-12-22 18:56:51 And this from organizations (like Whistler) that want the oil industry to pay for Global Warming! Gross hypocrisy! 
2455 2018-12-22 18:56:38 Definitely recommend trying cbd oil for pets, it's really effective for dog seizures!! 
2456 2018-12-22 18:56:37 haha you should never add that red stuff and that oil into the soup. Those two ingredients come from hell
2457 2018-12-22 18:56:36 Is turpenoid (turpentine substitute) also dangerous for the same reasons? That’s what we used in college, and I wanna make sure I get a safer replacement if I ever get into oil painting again.
2458 2018-12-22 18:56:34 They need to stop telling Canada we owe everything to Oil & Gas it’s that simple and leaders including our debate needs to explain that if we just built a pipeline we would be breaking the law but that never comes out of the mouths of the effing politicians in this country!
2459 2018-12-22 18:56:26 Definitely recommend trying cbd oil for pets, it's really effective for dog seizures!! 
2460 2018-12-22 18:56:23 End of this cycle I still think usdcad hits a record high. All Canadian investment dollars for the last decade have gone to real estate and oil. This one will be bad.

2463 2018-12-22 18:55:42 Does he really? Blimey! But wait, our economy isn't dependent on oil like Venezuela's is, is it? So now you don't know the history of the Labour Party, and you don't know how Venezuela's economy works, but you're still calling others uneducated and ill informed? Very interesting.
2464 2018-12-22 18:55:24 That type of attitude carried me to the very last round of layoffs in 2016 after the major downturn in oil and gas. It is one of the things I look for in new employees, too, because they are seeking guidance.
2465 2018-12-22 18:55:22 For me personally it's because 1. I can easily dismiss City's victories as oil money and 2. City already have one over on us by winning the league recently, so it makes no difference in that sense if they win again
2466 2018-12-22 18:55:11 I know a guy like that he has the same oil in his bike for over 3 years.   He said the dealership said it wasnt due for service

2469 2018-12-22 18:54:55 About to go get an oil change bet 5 a nigga say something to me 
2470 2018-12-22 18:54:53 Well, it's not the most grammatically satisfying tweet I've ever read.
2471 2018-12-22 18:54:47 Exactly my point. OPEC and oil prices have nothing to do with "Tinfoil Hats", nor does "Tinfoil Hats" have anything to do with the "Study of Q and waking up, on your own". Get it now? Tactical Humor:Agree and Amplify with something even more 'Lamer' than what you opponent said.
2472 2018-12-22 18:54:39 There must be an oil leak on the floor too. They fall down unprovoked too much to be stable.
2473 2018-12-22 18:54:19 When your brunch conversation consists of discussing the solar industry, conflict & climate change, the crash in oil & natural gas prices, hedging, the power grid & the Middle East, you know you're reunited with your smart little cookie twin.  @GeogBucky
2474 2018-12-22 18:54:19 Why nobody told me Neem oil smells horrible . I have to mix this with peppermint oil and almond oil  or is it on wash days only .
2475 2018-12-22 18:54:14 It's all about the Oil from the beginning!
2476 2018-12-22 18:54:14 うっせぇなマリモ食わせんぞ
2477 2018-12-22 18:54:00 And  imagine this
99% of the population thinks that oil is a fossil fuel(decomposed dinosaurs )
No one has ever dug up a dinosaur bone , while they are building a house or doing road construction. But scientist supposedly are the only people who can find dinosaur bones
2478 2018-12-22 18:53:54 You know you’re old when you get your husband an oil change for his birthday.
2479 2018-12-22 18:53:44 It was a big fat lie anyway. The oil wa poured away or destroyed in the Blitz.
2480 2018-12-22 18:53:29 ¡Extra! ¡Extra! Thor  acostó  a Oil Can Harry en Ecuador con un viejito junto a Robin.
2481 2018-12-22 18:53:27 Yep and I bumped into them at Iceland...mine had no palm oil!
2482 2018-12-22 18:53:27 Sen McConnell stood before America and said, the wall is between the president and Senate Dems. It's not my job.
That is weak as piss. If he wanted the Govt. to stay open, he'd burn the midnight oil until the job got done. The man has no interest in leading, he should retire.
2483 2018-12-22 18:53:03 Someone remind me on Christmas to buy the sunflower sweets oil plz
2484 2018-12-22 18:52:41 Yes 'external factors'.. Harper faced the largest financial crisis in 70 yrs, a drop in oil prices from $120/bbl to $20/bbl 2014, USA negative GDP economy yet Harper still was back to balance in 2015. Trudeau has faced none of this and if he does his deficits will skyrocket.
2485 2018-12-22 18:52:35 Definitely recommend trying cbd oil for pets, it's really effective for anxiety and stress for dogs!! 
2486 2018-12-22 18:52:30 Oh it's that Rachel Swindon person - wasn't there something about them? Anyway, when he was 17 his dad gave him a vial containing some of the annointing oil from queen Victoria's coronation 
2487 2018-12-22 18:52:29 Gotta go get my brakes done, oil changed , Tren hair done , and the of her stuff 
2488 2018-12-22 18:52:29 But it’s refined, so it’s ok. It’s well-mannered upperclass fish oil

2490 2018-12-22 18:52:19 They add groundnut oil to everything.
2491 2018-12-22 18:52:17 $TWTR and 37: oil & water.
2492 2018-12-22 18:52:15 WORLD oil prices are down. Not just Alberta. You want to increase how much we are selling when its $15 a barrel? SHORT TERM THINKING
2493 2018-12-22 18:52:14 I don’t remember but it’s enough.  It crazy. Heat is bad if you have oil heat tho
2494 2018-12-22 18:52:14 bouta drop this hot oil treatment in my head.  well needed moe
2495 2018-12-22 18:52:14 Stop driving so damn much or stop getting the expensive oil
2496 2018-12-22 18:52:10 For Christmas I just want peace.. a band, an oil Change and a spa day. Lol
2497 2018-12-22 18:52:05 Taxing imported oil would hurt Canadians, especially the middle class. Oil sands produces oil for export and so does not increase domestic supply
2498 2018-12-22 18:52:03 Yeah. There’s 4 different ways for the Third Gulf War to kick off, and zero reason for us to have troops in the same *hemisphere* when it does. 

Fracking means America has no ME interests any more. Europe and Asia needs the oil, we don’t. Not our problem.
2499 2018-12-22 18:51:53 Cooking a big pot of chicken and rice soup (‘Cuz that what Momma wanted). Starting with chicken broth and initial seasoning. Add oven roasted chicken breast, seasoned with olive oil and @PERFECTBITEBBQ Chicken rub. Then peas, carrots and rice. Pics to follow!
2500 2018-12-22 18:51:52 Anyone notice the absence of @SohiAmarjeet at the Oil and gas rallies? If this govt truly cared wouldn’t you think he would be there? During the Nisku one he was gladhanding community knitters. Let’s make him unemployed at our first opportunity.

2506 2018-12-22 18:51:04 I just made an aphrodisiac body oil infused with angelite, tiger lilly, and root trauma. Take a rose bath.
2507 2018-12-22 18:51:01 lol No no, don't withdraw yet. You still have SOME hot air left in you. 

Are you further alleging that all those things, enacted by Fed Libs and Prov NDP are so far reaching they've had a dramatic impact on the differential of US Bakken Oil [WCS's US equivalent]?
2508 2018-12-22 18:50:55 Thank you! I was finally able to fall asleep last night, but I’ll get peppermint oil at the store today bc I know it’s gonna come back over the next day or two. I really appreciate your help!! 
2509 2018-12-22 18:50:50 Putting baby oil on the floor is not a prank ,it’s dangerous somebody could really get hurt
2510 2018-12-22 18:50:49 Why is that federal credit needed at all for overpriced cars that fly off the shelf like there is no tomorrow? 

One would think the federal incentives should go for cheapest electric cars if it's about clean air and anti oil agenda...
2511 2018-12-22 18:50:48 I can't read the news anymore. Trump is defecating our country. This mornings headline is that he is in process of destroying the Alaska Arctic Wildlife Refuge 's entire 1.6 million acre Coastal Plain. He is leasing all of the property to oil and gas exploration and drilling.
2512 2018-12-22 18:50:47 that and 5 million quid from shell oil
2513 2018-12-22 18:50:35 Olive oil bénì
2514 2018-12-22 18:50:32 Lol maybe they should grease them with olive oil just in case.
2515 2018-12-22 18:50:26 My mama does that as well. 
She always checks things and she makes sure nothing has palm oil in it. 
She loves the orangutans. 
I think it’s because the have the same colour hair 
But they are very cute!
2516 2018-12-22 18:50:16 Am familiar (low income) with living that way. No doubt you found adaptations I did not. What did the pre-20thC folks do? They certainly not have  olive oil. DM me to discuss, if you wish. NO POLITICS, only survival housekeeping.
2517 2018-12-22 18:49:49 Causality and correlation bud.

The budget deficits exists before the NDP. When oil was $70 a barrel Prentice was projecting a $6b deficit.

I thought you knew the facts.
2518 2018-12-22 18:49:48 I'm just a old veteran, trying to learn drones. Have worked for some of the biggest oil gas comp, also the world's biggest lead mines. X~Ray tech, Water tech /inspector & many other jobs. Could have used a drone many times. #vetswithdrones
2519 2018-12-22 18:49:45 Trophies for everyone
2520 2018-12-22 18:49:38 Those guys working on slant rigs up there in that heavy oil are tough as nails. I worked lots in Slave and Wab but never Bonnyville. Beautiful lake country.
2521 2018-12-22 18:49:24 I have an essential oil for that 
2522 2018-12-22 18:49:23 Chili oil sounds like a painful experience in any application I can imagine using it.
2523 2018-12-22 18:49:17 i’m going to try the oil right now. thank you! 
2524 2018-12-22 18:49:04 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
2525 2018-12-22 18:49:00 No need to shift energy platforms. Just energy sources. We simply need to use our own oil and natural gas resources.

"Renewables" will grow in use as the free market requires. No intervention required.
2526 2018-12-22 18:48:21 Where is rent $825 in a city where a 25 year old could earn $100,000? North Dakota working on the oil pipeline? This is fantasy.
2527 2018-12-22 18:48:17 There’s nothing I hate more than coming to get my oil changed
2528 2018-12-22 18:48:04 85% of America's global economy is powered by oil & gas & coal. Our #RFID tags are made to tolerate the conditions of these fields.
2529 2018-12-22 18:47:33 They believe in USING God's name, in vain, to make LOTS of money, sanctify sexual adventures, and APPEAR religious! Smoke & mirrors! They read the same "How to Sell Snake Oil" sales manual as the GOP!
2530 2018-12-22 18:47:30 Did you know that the engines of the German Panzer tanks were manufactured and sold by the Ford Motor Co? Did you also know that the Luftwaffe would never have been able to fly without a special fuel additive patented and sold by JD Rockefeller's Standard Oil Co?
2531 2018-12-22 18:47:29 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil.

2539 2018-12-22 18:46:19 Yes im still here waiting for highways to clean up the oil. Couldn’t miss me had the van with the blue lights on 
2540 2018-12-22 18:46:10 Point is, if 'Union' requires Ireland to go against its interests how long before Irish decide its not worth it?
After all its not EU but UK that's Ire' largest trading partner, with 50% of exports. Also Ire' is dependent on energy, importing 90% of oil and over 90% of gas.
2541 2018-12-22 18:45:59 I forget the name of the store but in the village on the corner by trat they’ve got lots of natural remedies and stuff and I know they have cbd there in multiple forms. Gummies, tea, oil
2542 2018-12-22 18:45:53 Thank you so much! All of these are oil! But I try to do some acrylic pieces now and then!

2555 2018-12-22 18:44:32 I had to often use HF when acidizing sandstone core plugs about 1 inch in diameter. We used these flow tests to simulate permeability through oil producing sandstone formations. Just exercise CAUTION and wear PPE.

2559 2018-12-22 18:44:25 What it means is Australia can pull its military out of the Middle East and save taxpayers $0.5b a year. It’s not our oil war and we should never have been part of killing thousands of innocent people. #auspol
2560 2018-12-22 18:44:23 War mongering.  Are you also looking for WMD’s?  Let’s take a good look at who advertises on State of the Union.  Oh, it’s Defense contractors and big oil.  Might have something to do with your reporting. @jimmy_dore @JayarJackson @KyleKulinski
2561 2018-12-22 18:43:55 You have economic data that shows that? The costs of this policy are immediate and certain. It hurts the poor and middle classes. The costs on the other side are much more uncertain and difficult to measure. It certainly helps big oil though.

2564 2018-12-22 18:43:29 Justin Trudeau, talks about peace. Sells weapons to terrorist nations.

2566 2018-12-22 18:43:13 If you're searching for an excellent Christmas present for a loved one, consider buying a phial of Viper and Kirkpatrick's Sacred Chrism. It has all the miraculous properties of anointing oil AND oil the mundane properties of Olive Oil from Aldi.
2567 2018-12-22 18:43:12 Yep that's all I could think of too. Though those folks better have a "savings" category for when oil boom cycles go bust.
2568 2018-12-22 18:43:04 USA is always after oil in the Middle East!
2569 2018-12-22 18:43:03 Why are you selling water? To buy more color spray for your hair? You seem like a snake oil salesmen to me.
2570 2018-12-22 18:42:58 Many Christians in America do not care for their brethren. They support politicians who befriend nations where fellow Christians are thrown off roof tops for their faith in Christ. They worship the oil calf for their own wealth.
2571 2018-12-22 18:42:57 salt and oil with cucumbers. what do u want more?
2572 2018-12-22 18:42:34 My family has a Codfish tradition on Christmas, it's a little unusual for most Brazilians but my father who is always in charge of Christmas dinner makes a delicious Codfish Portuguese recipe with olive oil, potatoes and tomatoes.
2573 2018-12-22 18:42:34 My baby is getting an oil change, tire rotation, car wash, cleaning on the inside & all today.
2574 2018-12-22 18:42:32 Ah poor you. Without oil you'd be back in the fucking 3rd
2575 2018-12-22 18:42:14 Ask them how you say “oil”  it will piss you off haha

2580 2018-12-22 18:41:23 It’s got 5 woodburners - I think , exactly that reason cheaper than oil .... I would have to master a chainsaw 
2581 2018-12-22 18:41:21 I'm fine with that. And, yes, I meant economic interests. Once the last drop of oil is squeezed out of that region, we can put it back on ignore and let them revert to the Stone Age.
2582 2018-12-22 18:41:09 Consecrated by an Anglican priest whose holy orders JRM's Catholics church didn't recognise. So dad have him some oil in glass capsule. Probably bought it from a bloke down the pub.
2583 2018-12-22 18:41:01 I was just about to say try putting some coconut oil on then but if he isn't letting you touch his Paws that might be tricky
2584 2018-12-22 18:40:49 I'm not a bean counter but the military procurement issues were absolutely dreadful. The blossoming of the oil patch way too self serving and suiting American interests and not Canadians. Equalization payments a peculiar line drawn in the sand especially now.
2585 2018-12-22 18:40:46 Oil and gas is a boom/bust industry. It’s never been a stable career. These families knew the risk when they chose it. I have difficulty finding sympathy for those that demand Govt stay out of industry, and enjoy profits in the good times, but then demand Govt assistance in bad.
2586 2018-12-22 18:40:39 Thank you for the compliment. Since trump may be your standard for decency, I don't mind you considering me disgusting. God bless you and yours.

I have epilepsy. trump hemp bill keeps cannabis illegal. I already died once, 4 years ago from grand mal seizure -cannabis oil heals,
2587 2018-12-22 18:40:37 We need a sound for the knee hitting the thick oil
2588 2018-12-22 18:40:35 So all the “haters”, you don’t think border security is important? Needed? Ask the family that just this week lost a family member due to an illegal with the added sanctuary protections.

You make me sick, go pick on a oil company or something. #L
2589 2018-12-22 18:40:35 Katanya innisfree bagus tapi di muka w sama aja, masih bagusan ponds oil control nya
2590 2018-12-22 18:40:12 I’m about to drive all the way to Havasu for an oil change 
2591 2018-12-22 18:40:05 プールとか入るとよくわからないけど凄まじい勢いで浮くよ。
2592 2018-12-22 18:40:03 I live in Alberta, but I don’t get ANY of the perks from the oil industry Dave. NONE. Many of us don’t. Stop thinking that oil money ends up in all our pockets, it doesn’t. Not to mention how we’re getting pennies on the barrel for royalties. Go make you dough and stop whining.
2593 2018-12-22 18:40:00 Yes then this should work also try to get black seed oil and if you have a humidifier that’s also beneficial.
2594 2018-12-22 18:39:58 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
2595 2018-12-22 18:39:58 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2596 2018-12-22 18:39:56 Sci Fi. Action. It’s one of my favorites. Roughnecks from an oil rig saving the world by drilling a hole deep enough in an Earthbound asteroid to deploy a nuke. The nuke is meant to fracture the asteroid and force it off course. Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler
2597 2018-12-22 18:39:55 LEMON

2598 2018-12-22 18:39:53 RT is coconut oil is for your hair and skin, not food 
2599 2018-12-22 18:39:52 Laying around and watching movies , I don’t think y’all realize how out of the ordinary this is for me. I literally haven’t laid my eyes on a TV in forever. Send cuddles I got the weed and oil 
2600 2018-12-22 18:39:49 Have you looked into c.b.d. oil?
2601 2018-12-22 18:39:44 Take the oil! Take the mantle! Take the oil from the mantle!

2605 2018-12-22 18:39:06 How can our gas by 6 to 10 cents more expensive in #yql then in #yyc?!.  What a scam by local stations.  Yelling to protect our oil on one side of their mouth while ripping us off on the other @Spearmac @albertaNDP @SPhillipsAB @Alberta_UCP
2606 2018-12-22 18:39:06 1:37 and I'm now getting into my car after having a 9AM appointment for tire installation and oil change.... Smfh!!!!! NEVER!!!!!!! AGAIN!!!!!! Whole morning wasted now. Thanks so much @pepboysauto 
2607 2018-12-22 18:39:02 Bruce Lee once said that every time The Donald abolishes a crucial regulation, a member of congress assumes he is winning #tiredofwinning
2608 2018-12-22 18:38:58 January is always a rallying time, post Christmas n cold wave oil prices or dollars free movement.
2609 2018-12-22 18:38:56 I was eating spoonfuls of coconut oil just to get enough fat shit was ridiculous I’d rather just watch what I’m eating
2610 2018-12-22 18:38:48 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
2611 2018-12-22 18:38:46 My truck is slowly making it up hills not sure what could be wrong, back to you tube lol.
1 year of it sitting maybe a tune-up & oil change 
I'm just trying to get my kid to school  and continue running my business . — feeling confused
2612 2018-12-22 18:38:42 Wow, Bangladesh makes more money from Garment export more than we make from crude oil export.
2613 2018-12-22 18:38:32 They started drilling in Alaska's Arctic Wildlife Nature Preserve for oil and natural gas.
2614 2018-12-22 18:38:30 Are their oil supplies depleted already?
2615 2018-12-22 18:38:17 They're all so pissed off because.....well,
there goes all that lovely oil. Wonder how #Genie is feeling right about now. They'll have to vacate the #GolanHeights soon. After all, it belongs to Syria & Syria is NOT going to sit by and do nothing. #Israel or no Israel.
2616 2018-12-22 18:38:11 Preparing festive filet of beef tenderloin stuffed with spinach, roasted red peppers, garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper. Easy peasy! Throw on the grill later for yummy party sandwiches! Danielle Kinney

No oil, no progress

2621 2018-12-22 18:37:53 Our local store brand ice cream uses peanut oil! Why?!
2622 2018-12-22 18:37:49 No it's not. You said Alberta suffered credit down grades, has deficits and lost the Alberta advantage. Those are the results of low oil prices. Not a plan of action.

Besides low taxes have little correlation to improved economy. That playbook was tested in Kansas and failed.
2623 2018-12-22 18:37:41 I'm watching a mechanic at NTB try to sell a young woman and her grandma on high mileage oil for her oil change right...
2624 2018-12-22 18:37:35 We'd actually use water based oils in school, we were educated on dangerous pigments too, but they basically worked like normal oil paints with water as solvent! Turpentine was banned
2625 2018-12-22 18:37:30 MINT SUGAR

2627 2018-12-22 18:37:14 A life hack your Mama may not have told you: never buy olive oil on sale.
2628 2018-12-22 18:37:11 Exactly. This genius could complained about inflation when oil fell from 85 to 57. He's pretending to he dumb but I find him more suitable to run for politics.
2629 2018-12-22 18:37:06 Yeah, without the oil all you make is a huge mess.
2630 2018-12-22 18:36:47 Sudan is Oil Rich country but still with biggest social-economical problems... They can be second Saudi Arabia or UAE but corruption in all stage can't to reach this.
2631 2018-12-22 18:36:41 You asked if it was a fact?@proftaillefer shows you it's a fact by sharing a video. You then ask what it changes/proves. What do you think? It means there are more chances that his research may be influenced by oil companies. It doesn't prove anything, but it just seems likely.
2632 2018-12-22 18:36:37 my dumbass ran out of cbd oil right during the holidays lmao helllllo anxiety attacks
2633 2018-12-22 18:36:34 Just some M-grain essential oil  ;)
2634 2018-12-22 18:36:29 Stop oil drilling in #Alaska !

2636 2018-12-22 18:36:20 I'm 1kmiles early for my oil change they better check too make sure it's not leaking.
2637 2018-12-22 18:36:05 2019 would be highly affected by the price of crude oil and natural gas. And this price would be mainly  determined by speculative factors rather than by consumption /production levels.

2639 2018-12-22 18:35:47 Wow how could you not  what’s the point of soup and oil down 
2640 2018-12-22 18:35:42 burning the midnight oil ayy
2641 2018-12-22 18:35:34 Wait, Canada can always improve. Past the Post isn't ideal - but presidential countries tend to be subject to more corruption (e.g. phillipeans, or Russia tampering) ... arguing trade barriers and importing Saudi oil in consecutive sentences is incoherent though... your point?
2642 2018-12-22 18:35:34 my hair even has the audacity to fall out my head, bitch don't act like i moisturize you with coconut oil and repair you with expensive natural hair products that you like
2643 2018-12-22 18:35:28 Your using a hydrocarbon based product to complain about hydrocarbons. Stop using oil and the bi-products. Do your part.
2644 2018-12-22 18:35:21 Hi Helen, where are the racist remarks going to bring you up just like oil again? You allow people to lure you out then do you respond as above? We look up to you and see a senseless mud fight? As a fellow child of the Lord I ask you for Matt. 5: 22,23? No judgment.
2645 2018-12-22 18:35:16 It's spent on promoting fossil fuel, as a whole. A byproducts of oil happens to be petroleum, which also has byproducts, such as chapstick and, gasoline. In promoting the whole, it also promotes the byproducts.
2646 2018-12-22 18:35:13 Wonder why we need to drill more wells when there’s already a crude oil glut?

Big oil wants to pump out and sell all reserves before alternate fuel sources make it irrelevant and unprofitable.

They want to burn every last drop...

ASAP
2647 2018-12-22 18:35:12 Let me get up and get an oil change.
2648 2018-12-22 18:35:04 Paired with citrus, bacon, or even just crudo with salt, pepper, and olive oil, #Scallops are definitely on our #SevenFishes dinner tables. How about yours? We have fresh, delicious, Domestic-Caught U10 Scallops are on special for the rest of the month. #yum
2649 2018-12-22 18:35:03 Let us pause in a moment of silence, to honor all of the comfort colors shirts & pull overs who have lost their lives to oil stains.
2650 2018-12-22 18:35:01 Pan sear only if you’re going for breasts. Score the skin, generously season both sides with salt and pepper, sear slow and low in olive oil until the center is fully cooked by still moist and tender, using a meat thermometer will help gauge how well done or rare you want it.
2651 2018-12-22 18:34:53 All the really green people seem to have no idea how much of the electrical distribution system is composed of oil based products.
Including the system distributing electricity through their homes.
Not a huge pipeline supporter but I support hypocrites even less.
Sorry
2652 2018-12-22 18:34:46 Oh noo!!! Oweee! To minimize scarring, use vitamin E oil/extract. Really helped my scar on my shin, when I went through a glass table.
2653 2018-12-22 18:34:33 Can't be bothered to peel potatoes so little baked spuds it is. Chucked in a roasting dish with oil & salt. If it's good enough for James Martin...
2654 2018-12-22 18:34:29 There are basically two types of Republican Congressmen:
1) Hypocritical, sycophantic Trumpian snake oil salesmen, and
2) see above.
2655 2018-12-22 18:34:25 She is right, croplands have potential for storing carbon. However not under the management vegans support, that is leading to agriculture being the most destructive & extractive industry ever - more so than coal and oil.  I would give up on @_life_imperfect
2656 2018-12-22 18:34:24 That's way too much for oil change
2657 2018-12-22 18:34:16 Oil’s changed. Never underestimate a big@$$ piece of pipe and a Rudy!
2658 2018-12-22 18:34:13 Hasn't anyone else read the article that says oil companies are moving to driverless technology? There won't be trucking Jobs, pipeline or no. Suncor is building a fleet that will cut 400 jobs over the next 6 years. So are mining companies.
2659 2018-12-22 18:34:01 My favorite vinaigrette to make at home: tamari, rice vinegar, agave nectar, lemon juice, toasted sesame oil. Take out the oil and it's a bomb tofu marinade too 
2660 2018-12-22 18:33:27 You're being lied to.  China's state run firms aren't anymore subsidized that a lot of american firms.  Why do we subsidize our oil companies?  Farms?  Electric Battery Companies?  And others.
2661 2018-12-22 18:33:26 Sana oil
2662 2018-12-22 18:33:24 When I reach my body goals , I’m having a full blown photo shoot . Body oil , lights , very sultry . Imma be on my grown woman shit fr 
2663 2018-12-22 18:33:20 Or host it in an oil rich country.
2664 2018-12-22 18:33:14 made a olive oil and lemon juice, spiced honey, and mustard sandwich
2665 2018-12-22 18:33:11 my car won’t stop beeping at me bc it needs oil?? like ok bitch i’m hungry too shut up
2666 2018-12-22 18:32:47 I think the LFC aversion we have is probably linked to the fact that they are kind of succeeding in the way we ‘should’ have been doing all these years. 

No oil money, unheralded signings (until they were positioned for VVD) etc. They’ve taken our model and executed far better.
2667 2018-12-22 18:32:41 Huh. I did not know about cedar oil. Pogo hates that stupid medicine for fleas and he drools like a Newfoundland after each application. Smellin like the forest = bonus!
2668 2018-12-22 18:32:29 * Italian sis like wh*te But with olive oil
2669 2018-12-22 18:32:29 All provs indispensable, one not more than others. Each with probs and strengths. Only 1 seems to complain about its woes being only others’ fault. Eastern pipeline is not PQ, it’s uneconomic w low oil prices. West pipeline no JT ‘silver bullets’. Deficit: unaffordable tax regime
2670 2018-12-22 18:32:22 Biotin, oil, and comb it. And when you get a lil stubble don't shave it
2671 2018-12-22 18:32:18 Your tweets are apt. I like them. 
More oil to your thinking process.
2672 2018-12-22 18:32:14 @Honda wants to charge $244 for oil change and tire rotation...
Called @Valvoline they said about one fiddy 
2673 2018-12-22 18:32:04 I love doing my makeup when it’s chilly. My face doesn’t produce so much oil lmao
2674 2018-12-22 18:31:59 Coconut oil
2675 2018-12-22 18:31:50 I hate myself for the amount of oil I poured in these eggs yhu
2676 2018-12-22 18:31:42 People be trying to sell a damn truck that's almost 20 years old, over 250 thousand miles but it's got a fresh oil change and a light bar! And fancy rims!!! Asking 15 grand.. get the fuck out of here.. it's a piece of shit
2677 2018-12-22 18:31:38 I have been fighting bad policies since Harper took power and I haven't stopped in spite of Trudeau. The system is simply designed to push oil forth either way. Doesn't matter what side one sits on. They own the scales and calibrate it as they wish.
2678 2018-12-22 18:31:32 Parboil and then drain and give a shake in the pan with some fine polenta. Then put in oven tray which has already got hot oil at bottom!
2679 2018-12-22 18:31:30 Don’t Blame IRAQ,Was Hillary/Liar OBAMA FRAUD Created ISIS
Recruited Encouraged/Paid Arranged Fighters From EU/Around The World For
ISIS Fighter 
OBAMA Financed/Regularly Supplied ISIS
OBAMA Allowed ISIS Selling Oil&Ship
OBAMA Shielded ISIS & Did Not Fight ISIS  @realDonaldTrump
2680 2018-12-22 18:31:21 I say yes lol it sounds kinda like a hair dryer but clean up and actual cooking is way easier than oil fryer it just takes a little longer
2681 2018-12-22 18:31:11 Try castor oil, hair oil, however enforce our laws.
2682 2018-12-22 18:31:04 As an old Cold War Warrior I read that piece and damn near cried.
 
Our country is like a finely tuned internal combustion engine that has been red lined with contaminated oil.  It can be fixed with a lot of work, but will never run the same again.
2683 2018-12-22 18:31:03 The oil imported into Canada will be taxed when it is burnt.  Having said that, yes, border carbon adjustments would be preferable to output based subsidies.  And having said *that* Sheer is saying he won't try to meet our Paris targets after all.
2684 2018-12-22 18:30:58 Hope I'm not an awful person.... I love Brussel sprouts, baked with olive oil, salt& pepper.
2685 2018-12-22 18:30:47 Stir together 3 pints Graham crackers with 1 pound Ahi Tuna. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve warm.
2686 2018-12-22 18:30:43 And he and his supporters excoriated Hillary for taking contributions from individual donors in the oil and gas industry.
2687 2018-12-22 18:30:42 Got that oil change out the way . I’ll get brakes next
2688 2018-12-22 18:30:42 William Rees-Mogg of course thought the Hitler Diaries were genuine so not surprised he was fleeced for some fake snake oil 
2689 2018-12-22 18:30:41 Surely you can't be certain of that. You claim that the oil was used and then disposed of... How can you know that it was all disposed of, and that however many vials weren't kept by whoever?
2690 2018-12-22 18:30:31 French company Total license denied by Brazilian Environmental Agency to drill for oil near the Amazon Reef.
2691 2018-12-22 18:30:12 You just keep using oil every day as much as the next person, pretending you are green. At least I am frank about the use of it.
2692 2018-12-22 18:30:09 Cars need attention just as patients do.Took me time to get used to checking oil levels and checking my dashboard for warning signals.God is able.
2693 2018-12-22 18:29:37 My oil changes always expensive af 
2694 2018-12-22 18:29:36 Look no further that oil. Trump talked down the oil price, oil price collapse. Energy sector stocks hammered, credit spread widening. Good luck with the energy capex in 2019!!
2695 2018-12-22 18:29:34 Republicans want only one thing, power. They’ll say or do anything, true or not, to convince their mean-spirited voters to buy the snake oil they’re peddling.
2696 2018-12-22 18:29:32 I have seen too many tweets lumping oil workers,racists and climate change deniers all as one, they have no fuckin idea all the different ethnic groups that work in that sector and how stringent the environmental polices they follow are.
2697 2018-12-22 18:29:25 I know it's just Cardiff but under Opana we would have been sitting so deep we could find oil
2698 2018-12-22 18:29:22 2 Vaselines plus baby oil 1litre
2699 2018-12-22 18:29:16 Your palette is incredible! Do you work in acrylic or oil?
2700 2018-12-22 18:28:56 Today I learnt the following in a very short space of time:

A1Z26 ciphers on numbers to letters,
Steganography,
The St Luis Oil Spot prices,
That my heart rate can exceed 200 bpm,
& how to hate Tom Dante with every ounce of my body.
2701 2018-12-22 18:28:43 It's about centralized control more than oil. The problem has been batteries that they can store enough energy for centralized distribution. Eventually, oil requires more energy to extract than is extracted.
2702 2018-12-22 18:28:18 Desaceleración hay, pero creadas por situaciones políticas, hasta el precio del OIL es lo mismo, trapicheos entre la OPEP...
2703 2018-12-22 18:28:15 Is the tea tree oil strong the smell gives me migraines 
2704 2018-12-22 18:28:09 Exactly! So much. But that’s sooo good I’m so happy for you! (‘: but thank you so much! also what type and brand of cbd oil did you use?
2705 2018-12-22 18:28:09 Politicians lie.

People trying to avoid answering g simple questions like what AB would do to weather low oil prices lie. 

I don't.
2706 2018-12-22 18:28:02 Where can I buy cbd oil in nyc/jersey? It’s for a Christmas gift.
2707 2018-12-22 18:28:00 The person from that restaurants is very rude and non sense. I have received worst quality food. Only taste of color and worst quality oil is used. Thrawn all these stuff in dustbin.
2708 2018-12-22 18:27:56 Turkey wants to murder the Kurds. Russia wants to control Syria and by proxy the whole Middle East and their oil. Meaning you (or the next President) will have to make a BAD deal with Russia for whatever goods you need from the Mid East. Putin and MBS are already on “high five..”
2709 2018-12-22 18:27:48 They do! When you think about it,  oil doesn't evaporate exactly,  so it makes sense.
2710 2018-12-22 18:27:47 me: CBD Oil doesn’t even get you high!

also me: JUUL LIFE amirite!?
2711 2018-12-22 18:27:39 Oil Change 
Tire Pressure 
Full Tank 

Mama, I am coming home for Christmas!!!
2712 2018-12-22 18:27:31 2.4 lakh Crore pending Oil Bond created by UPA 
2713 2018-12-22 18:27:27 Your car probably didn't "blow up" because of pressure from not changing the oil. It probably "blew up" because it didn't have enough lubrication to reduce friction and cool internal parts. Totally different mechanism than your envisioning.
2714 2018-12-22 18:27:16 yep and even scumbag "neoliberals" in europe are saying trump is doing what putin wants by getting troops out of syria  (belgium, germany, france, netherlands) in a nutshell these ppl all want wars for oil and natural gas...but will never ever tell the truth about it
2715 2018-12-22 18:27:15 I loveeee bluff city soap. All you natural soap/oil/body butter etc users should check it out 
2716 2018-12-22 18:27:05 This wonka oil cart fire
2717 2018-12-22 18:27:04 You can see similar playbook in EPA in USA which Trump stuffed with hostile s from oil corps just to make his enemies die of high BP 
2718 2018-12-22 18:26:56 Had to call soda *clears throat, puts hands on hips, does jumping jacks, meditates, gets eyebrows done, drinks eight glasses of water a day, changes oil, checks my cat for fleas* “pop” today.  Family from Ohio was in the room and a translator was not.
2719 2018-12-22 18:26:55 Manny. My goodness spend some time learning about how oil sands are extracted in comparison to oil wells. This sort of ignorance is unacceptable!
2720 2018-12-22 18:26:45 Me too. After the Worlds Fair, the display traveled across the country, and they included injection-molding machines that made the dinosaur toys for sale on the spot. You got them while they were still warm! Sponsored by Sinclair Oil.

2724 2018-12-22 18:26:23 It’s Oklahoma. There’s an oil derrick in front of the state Capitol!
2725 2018-12-22 18:26:17 @realDonaldTrump Why are we giving 10million to the Ukrain.  The BIDEN,S own the OIL & GAS WELLS, let these drug dealing bastards pay for there own security.  Our tax dollars are needed here for out people and our own security.  HUNTER BIDEN, has made millions military dealing.
2726 2018-12-22 18:26:15 Gotta go get breaks oil change and more priorities today 
2727 2018-12-22 18:25:51 Thank you so much !!! 
A question though do you use normal Nuln oil  or Gloss ?
2728 2018-12-22 18:25:40 I came to get an oil change and I didn’t know how to pop the hood so I looked retarded :)))
2729 2018-12-22 18:25:37 打倒さおりん
2730 2018-12-22 18:25:36 Fake news dude.  The vast majority of C02 released into the atmosphere occurs naturally.  Rotting vegetation, dead trees, cows, algae in the ocean etc. 

Not 20 some odd oil companies.
2731 2018-12-22 18:25:24 Hemp oil and industrial hemp are legal.
2732 2018-12-22 18:25:18 lmao this oil change go up $10 every time I come through
2733 2018-12-22 18:25:18 4 pints at my now long-gone local from my big brother. 

Better than anointing oil any day
2734 2018-12-22 18:25:04 You don't have ANY national security interest in there! There is a fucking ocean between Syria, Afghanistan and the US! You have oil and gas by yourselves! The US could be COMPLETLY self-sustaining. Put your troops at the US border and defend from there.
2735 2018-12-22 18:24:55 so i’m getting an oil change and why is it $83 for full synthetic 
2736 2018-12-22 18:24:53 散々しごいてやろう
2737 2018-12-22 18:24:35 I have some engine oil from the Old Testament it was from Moses Triumph I think...
2738 2018-12-22 18:24:35 did not Trump also say he will «take the oil»? How can he leave before having taken that oil??
2739 2018-12-22 18:23:53 よし

2740 2018-12-22 18:23:51 Lots of peppermint oil in places like behind your ears, nape of your neck, temples (not too much or your eyes will burn), and all around the jaw should help. Also something that will heat the area & loosen it up (like a warm cloth). Hope you feel better this happens to me a lot
2741 2018-12-22 18:23:45 Still playing much better without Mou .. I reckon they could park the bus away at Cardiff with Mou. ManUtd is big enough and worth to be the ones we fight for title against instead of the fraud Oil City.
2742 2018-12-22 18:23:40 Chins oil

2744 2018-12-22 18:23:29 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
2745 2018-12-22 18:23:27 I tease of course. I got me mum some oil.
2746 2018-12-22 18:23:13 So I used @mydrunkelephant’s virgin marula face oil lastnight for the first time... OH MY GOODNESS. Just that one use of it, the texture on my forehead went away completely! I had little bumps everywhere, even in my chin. My face is so smooth and soft!
2747 2018-12-22 18:23:03 Hitting him with oil soaked Lithar!
2748 2018-12-22 18:22:40 Give us a fucking pipeline! Oil companies are getting killed by taxes and regulations in this country. Canada has the cleanest oil in the world! Social license has been paid for. Wake up!
2749 2018-12-22 18:22:38 I’m a combat Marine, fought in Iraq- I agree, the most American thing we can do is have a Manhattan Project type program to realize cold fusion and let those backwards fucks drown in their oil.
2750 2018-12-22 18:22:27 Onions in suya are actually very important. Onions neutralise the oxidative effect of the chemicals in the oil and help prevent cancer
2751 2018-12-22 18:22:23 Olive oil and sit it out in the sun all day
2752 2018-12-22 18:22:16 Oil changes are boring
2753 2018-12-22 18:22:13 Apparently baby oil helps? Never tried myself tho!
2754 2018-12-22 18:22:10 So his favourite Christmas present ever, was, quite literally, Snake Oil. Who would have thought it?
2755 2018-12-22 18:21:56 They're the same here, the high oil is why I'm not a fan
2756 2018-12-22 18:21:48 The oil isn’t the only thing buried deep in the sand. Honestly there ARE environmental impacts from oil sands. To suggest otherwise is a lie. Does that impact outweigh the economic importance, no.
2757 2018-12-22 18:21:38 Hobby lobby and other craft stores sell linseed oil too so it's easy to find
2758 2018-12-22 18:21:30 Hey Garnett nice sentiment but let's focus our energy on defeating socialist Liberals and getting jobs in oil for your constituents
2759 2018-12-22 18:21:26 Lavender or tea tree oil and certain supplements such as Dong Quai and Tribulus terrestris have also been associated with gynecomastia.
2760 2018-12-22 18:21:22 @BetoORourke took the LARGEST amount of oil & gas money in the entire Congress. You cannot seriously put Beto and #GreenNewDeal in the same tweet!

2762 2018-12-22 18:21:01 Endless. And useless.
Oil = money.
Money = power.
We all know this war has 2 purposes... protecting oil (for power and money) and testing new weapons and tactics.
There is no noble principle behind it.
Let’s get American values back in focus and practice.

2763 2018-12-22 18:20:38 Because building roads, subsidizing oil and car manufacturers is the definition of cost efficient. And then paying to clean up affer the break the environment afterward.
2764 2018-12-22 18:20:38 Does anyone have any good tricks for darkening leather? I was given a devocoux girth and it’s still orange . Have tried hydrophane darkening oil and efface conditioner.
2765 2018-12-22 18:20:34 Good.  Trump supporters deserve to be talked down to.  Even Trump knows you’re poorly educated and will believe whatever snake oil he sells you if he wraps it in bigotry.

You guys are ruining the country for the sake of hate and greed.
2766 2018-12-22 18:20:34 Oil is Oil. The idea that some customer is going to buy "ethical" oil or because you have stringent standards is bunk. Its the price and type of oil that matters. Period.
2767 2018-12-22 18:20:30 The war was over oil. Same reason has is buddy buddy with Saudi  Arabi
2768 2018-12-22 18:20:22 Artist Loft paint is like oil paint on the low low low

2772 2018-12-22 18:19:50 3) cod fish fillet with onions, garlic and potatoes. lots of olive oil. put it in the oven, there’ll be no error.
2773 2018-12-22 18:19:38 Really wished that @subaru had shared their issue with EyeSight, rough idle and Sirius radio/Harmon Kardon issues with me before I signed the paperwork. Oh and also. That my 2017 #outback's oil capacity really is 5.1 quarts and not 6 that the dealers always use.
2774 2018-12-22 18:19:37 If we'd stop pissing around with fossil fuels, we wouldn't have to get involved in any wars.  It's all about oil.
2775 2018-12-22 18:19:13 Put on some massage oil and you’re gonna be invincible :)
2776 2018-12-22 18:19:12 putting pure tea tree essential oil directly on my pimples like a motherfucking badass 
2777 2018-12-22 18:19:09 It is not primarily for oil fields and pipelines in Syria, same was true in Libya. The point is to destroy any independent power, now that the US empire is weakening, to facilitate continued exploitation of the former colonies.
2778 2018-12-22 18:19:03 but i dont have any olive oil
2779 2018-12-22 18:18:56 No OIL, No LIFE!!!

2781 2018-12-22 18:18:22 Erdogan's son-in-law is in the oil business with ISIS. They aren't going to destroy ISIS. They're going to massacre our allies the Kurds. #TrumpResign
2782 2018-12-22 18:17:51 You have oil
2783 2018-12-22 18:17:43 alguém me ensina a pintar com oil pastel

2786 2018-12-22 18:17:35 9) le pétrole a été découvert en Iran en 1908, dans les environs de Masjed Soleyman (Khouzistan). Mozaffaredin Shah ayant accordé un accord de concession pétrolière au britannique William D’Arcy, cette découverte mène à la formation de l’Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC)
2787 2018-12-22 18:17:34 Take away the oil and you will have a village of 100 People in a year. School will close, stores will close and then you will be driving an hour for more than just your fast food. But you are right, separation will destroy Canada @JustinTrudeau is well on his the way to do that
2788 2018-12-22 18:17:30 Yay! Heating oil delivered! I can shower and do dishes/laundry now!!!

Pbbffftt - who am I kidding? Couch-potatoing is the extent of today’s activity. #spoonie #HeatingPadOnHigh
2789 2018-12-22 18:17:16 Oh god i forgot that people use to actually whip their oil.
2790 2018-12-22 18:17:08 I agree that their current predicament is precarious. They used the chaos created by the insurgents, to seize control of important oil wells & reserves. Without US forces there to protect them, they will likely have to relinquish control
2791 2018-12-22 18:17:05 Shut up, we need to get out of reservations for oil in the USA, we need Americans to be out of work or making more than minimum wage. They can’t live like that.
2792 2018-12-22 18:17:05 Dan, forget us educated elite. You should contact Coal Producers, Oil Companies, and the Tories with your iron clad proof. They will love you for it, and make sure we all hear about it. Go on, be the hero!
2793 2018-12-22 18:17:03 Your comprehension skills are as astute as your politics. When our Albertan economy is thriving so do our small business’. This is a two way street. Our oil prices were roughly $11 a barrel last I checked. Which is as terrible as your argumentative skills.
2794 2018-12-22 18:16:49 Vendiendo clubes de barrio a la Standard Oil.
2795 2018-12-22 18:16:45 Because the US made the middle East worse, all for oil. The unlawful invasion of Iraq and the removal of Saddam created ISIS. The least they can do is clean their mess. The interference in the middle east makes it the US governments problem. Protect the Kurds, your allies.
2796 2018-12-22 18:16:15 Added eucalyptus oil to my shower last night after I saw that HeyFranHey tip. Life changing. I don’t wanna take a regular shower again.
2797 2018-12-22 18:16:12 @realDonaldTrump... Obviously to keep oil low... Dangerous policies.... Just throw out Powell to make it catastrophic!!! Bloody narcist!
2798 2018-12-22 18:15:59 I’m capable of checking my own oil thank uuuuuuuu
2799 2018-12-22 18:15:59 How do you begin to process that comment? A phial of anointing oil? I got driving lessons
2800 2018-12-22 18:15:48 The thing is we need to know prior to visiting. The difference between pineapple juice as a base or olive oil are very different when adhering to a lifestyle such as #keto.  Not worth the risk.  Not sure why you can’t post at least basic ingredients? Seems shady :-(
2801 2018-12-22 18:15:37 Trying to Mix oil with water, katse le legotlo
2802 2018-12-22 18:15:15 Wish it was that cheap in north east pa. Nepa is always last to feel effects of cheap oil 
2803 2018-12-22 18:15:15 my coworkers collectively got me all the ingredients to make julia child's croissants, fancy olive oil, rosé gummies and a jade roller and TBH I've never felt more SEEN
2804 2018-12-22 18:15:06 Let's see:
for pescatarians I would suggest Bacalhoada. It's basically salted codfish baked in a shit ton of olive oil with potatoes and onions.

2806 2018-12-22 18:14:37 wild how he got rejected from low tier state schools when he applied of his own merits but SUDDENLY he was good enough for harvard after he used a shooting that he wasnt even at school for to become famous
2807 2018-12-22 18:14:33 Also Im spending like 10 thousand dollars on rick simpson oil to revitalize my organs from damage I did caused by a mushroom overdose I took which made me hallucinate constantly for 5 years because I was low on vitamins I'm now healed from the hallucinations but wtf
2808 2018-12-22 18:14:27 About to make some steaks for my man using this cannabutter & canna oil I made last night lol
2809 2018-12-22 18:14:25 @mlpguy 1/food for thought ... could the fear driving MLPs now be the possibility that Putin and/MBS play on Trump’s stupidity in wanting oil prices much lower.  They could try a replay of 1999,  drive the price below US marginal cost to produce.
2810 2018-12-22 18:13:57 So, which oil and gas executive will get the job now?
2811 2018-12-22 18:13:42 Not claiming I'm a scientist...but I have blown up my car by not changing the oil lol! I would think if that example was scaled to the globe,  it could cause some damage.
2812 2018-12-22 18:13:40 All the money for us Americans ends up in the wallets of corrupt American politicians.  What's your point?  If Trump wanted to #MAGA,  he'd challenge the major corporations and their control over our politicians.  Remove oil/cigarettes/big pharma from the equation.  But he won't
2813 2018-12-22 18:13:30 Haha, como que I stopped w the glowing oil. I  just use face mists.
2814 2018-12-22 18:13:29 tentatively the class war is gonna start on the next once yearly occasion I let myself go into the Detroit road heinens. ill have to punch out the first 50 year old rich bitch that almost runs me over with her grocery cart that has only 2 bottles of olive oil in it. go from there
2815 2018-12-22 18:13:28 Limits to Growth and our idiotic continuing dependence on supplies of oil we have known since 1956 are inadequate to our needs have been accepted by everyone as reality  National policy is to survive at the expense of everyone else.  This is a recipe for disaster.

2817 2018-12-22 18:13:13 Yes, our current government is on track to destroy our forests and give nat'l parks to big oil.  I am sorry for everyone having to pay for a President's tantrum.  I do appreciate your service and pray for our parks and forests every day.
2818 2018-12-22 18:13:11 ...of the Titanic. Big Oil got their price spike from the Iran Nuke nix. The GOP got their tax cut, defense spending & a hold over the SCOTUS. Now he's a liability. Oil & the markets are tanking. They'll eventually drop him. Face it ... McConnell holds the real power, not Trump.
2819 2018-12-22 18:13:02 Use enough oil
2820 2018-12-22 18:12:41 Oh my gosh that's the best news!!!!!!! I hope so too! Enjoy every moment, every second. Can she take castor oil?
2821 2018-12-22 18:12:18 PH airport still remains the biggest joke. I remember the first time i went there. I was so shocked to see our luggage on the bare floor. Like a whole oil producing somewhere
2822 2018-12-22 18:12:00 Alex? Huh? Are you okay? 

You know you haven't actually explained how AB has (or will) weather the continued and long term low oil prices.

2828 2018-12-22 18:11:36 Scheer tweets with oil soaked fingers that he'll come up with a climate plan someday. If he wants  to contribute extra to climate breakdown, he should just clearly say it. There are tremendous long-term costs to this approach economically, socially, and morally. I wanna know.
2829 2018-12-22 18:11:31 It may be a signal of Global de-escalation. Turkey, Saudi’s and Russia will cool the Middle East. USA now produces more oil than SA that war is Over. Thank God for Texas

2842 2018-12-22 18:10:11 Making CBD legal on itself is huge. Anti seizure and cancer fighting properties. No more paying thousands to get CBD oil. Huge for the healthcare field and everything else.

2846 2018-12-22 18:09:54 Could have been "beard oil," which is a thing.

2857 2018-12-22 18:08:24 Correlation and causality are not the same. Credit downgrades and lost investment weredue to huge drops in international oil and differentials not provincial policies.
2858 2018-12-22 18:08:06 As a European I am so scared that Russia with their $40-60 billion military budget and crumbling oil/gas based economy will just invade all of Europe and put us in communist slave camps. Get a grip you are just swallowing up the war machine propaganda no questions asked.
2859 2018-12-22 18:07:50 I haven't read a single scientific study that suggests if we don't tap oil out of the earth we will have more volcanic eruptions. It looks to me like a completely unsupported musing by someone with no science background.

2861 2018-12-22 18:07:43 Dear @realDonaldTrump 
You put your own interests over the people.
You accept big $$$ from lobbyists, including coal and oil industries. 
You’ve threatened future generations with your war on climate. 
Your actions in Syria are reckless. As a US citizen, resign now.
#TrumpResign
2862 2018-12-22 18:07:33 I thought I was living life dangerously driving on 0% oil... Be careful!
2863 2018-12-22 18:07:33 That's great! Like I said, not knocking them. Although I buy my books used and/or go to the library, trees can be planted, and your e-reader is made of plastic derived from oil and natural gas liquids, so in my case the environmental argument is kind of moot.
2864 2018-12-22 18:07:29 making it oil what?
2865 2018-12-22 18:07:26 French fries aren't vegan or vegetarian, as the oil can contain beef fat.

2870 2018-12-22 18:06:38 Again, that goes back to the disappearance of disposable cash with low government spending, low oil prices, and investors’ lack of confidence in the market. Businesses , thus people, don’t have the disposable cash to spend on stuff anymore, which is all a result of fear.
2871 2018-12-22 18:06:34 Why would the federal Liberals will not listen to a man who is very astute in the Oil & Gas sector is beyond me! Free flowing Western Canadian Oil to Canadian refineries means $$ & jobs for all Canadians!

2873 2018-12-22 18:06:23 Hi James, we’ve never used palm oil in our chocolate, yet small amounts come indirectly from added ingredients, such as biscuits. In all cases our suppliers are RSPO certified which guarantees the palm oil we use is sustainably sourced. Tweet 1/2

We arent your garbage truck.  Its just our garbage, and we are a clean white christian country.

2876 2018-12-22 18:06:11 I want greater Canadian oil access to world markets . The US $TarSands Campaign has resulted in them being their our only customer. They get our oil at a huge discount, refine it and sell it back at a big profit and make big money selling theirs on the world market. It’s crazy.
2877 2018-12-22 18:06:09 do they use motor oil for lube 
2878 2018-12-22 18:06:09 I need to get my tires rotated and oil changed today. But I really don't feel like it.
2879 2018-12-22 18:05:53 You must be kidding— the oil industry is one of the most regulated in the country. Provincial and federal regulators- environmental, resource conservation, public safety, health, occupational health and safety,
2880 2018-12-22 18:05:43 And I don't support any candidate that takes money from big business especially oil and gas

2882 2018-12-22 18:05:35 I ran a mechanic business for 5 years back in the late 80’s and always said the engine designers should maintain one for a year before they go into a car. Mercedes had an oil filter on upside down and over the exhaust making it impossible to not smoke. This is the same.
2883 2018-12-22 18:05:29 Really?? Never used it. The stylist was saying it’s a light version of gel and cream and allat. Did you try using it with oil
2884 2018-12-22 18:05:25 I live in Alberta, I work in oil and gas. I believe there are more important things to worry about, such as human rights. Not saying I like what our PM is doing, but I don't think our industry is going to end anytime soon.
2885 2018-12-22 18:05:23 Check your peanut butter jar to see if it has palm oil in it. (If so, buy another brand that just has peanuts in it. That is better for overall health.)

2892 2018-12-22 18:04:41 What about defense industry? AMAZON and Microsoft ? How about agro business. You have problems with Beto’s funding from oil industry employees but willing to look over Bernie’s funding sources? Is that fair?
2893 2018-12-22 18:04:38 Someone stole one of the essential oil samples from the oil diffuser my mom got me for Christmas. How dare you.

2895 2018-12-22 18:04:33 Yeah, that too. I’ve got some olive oil drops for that. It soothes if nothing else. I don’t really seem to need painkillers, but I’m fed up with my dysfunctional nose and this dratted cough! The Night Nurse seems to help with that. I just wish I could go to bed and sleep it off!

2903 2018-12-22 18:03:34 Love this. We need to support each other. When I see other women ending marriages... I take them some Lavender oil, a journal, give them my number to call me if they need help with the kids, I tell them like birth, the transition is hell.  But the newborn (you) is worth it.
2904 2018-12-22 18:03:34 So reducing greenhouse gases, do you know where the CO2 comes from? The burning of fossil fuels - coal, gas and oil. So why do you not stop the leading of parcels of the Wayne National Forest? Show you mean it..

2914 2018-12-22 18:02:56 I feel your pain on this. 
I did a mix of things to get mine off. 
1. Steam face & apply oil to lashes to remove. 
2. Leave oil on eyes over night & try to remove in the morning. 
3. Ardell sells lash glue remover for about 5 bucks. 

Goodluck

2917 2018-12-22 18:02:46 Time for annual chopping board maintenance. Sand with fine sandpaper, rub with lemon juice, and dust with hefty amount of salt. Wrap in plastic wrap and leave for a couple of days. Or more. Rinse, dry, and oil and TADA(!) they're like new. #kitchenwisdom
2918 2018-12-22 18:02:40 I use spike lavender oil and walnut oil based paint, instead of the more typical turpentine/linseed oil paints, it really has changed my workflow for the better, I a brand of oil paints from a company known as M.Graham, they place a huge emphasis on solvent free oil painting
2919 2018-12-22 18:02:37 Looked at the ingredients on my well known butter substitute spread, 30% palm oil. aggh! didn't realise this. Going back to low fat butter, ingredients, cream, milk and a small amount of salt. My grandfather used butter everyday and was climbing a ladder to fix a roof at 94.
2920 2018-12-22 18:02:33 The US is the self proclaimed, "World Super Power" with the "Leader of the free World". They have had their finger in the middle East making things worse as soon as they discovered oil there. Also why waste so much on military if you aren't going to finish what you wrecked.

There are people who cut oranges.

This may also be a major division in the human species.

#TeamPeel

(Orange oil is a major bitter; when you cut an orange, the oil gets on the knife and transfers to the fruit. There’s a lot less when peeling.)
2923 2018-12-22 18:02:14 So I was learning how to change the oil in my car and I was super excited and turns out my bolt was stripped lmao so now I’m at Walmart.
Still excited tho.

2935 2018-12-22 18:01:01 Assad previously granted the Kurds considerable autonomy, but, the Kurds took advantage of the chaos caused by the insurgents, to seize control of most of Syria’s best oil wells. They will likely have to relinquish control, if the US forces aren’t there to protect them #oilwars
2936 2018-12-22 18:00:54 Coincidence that the food industry has marketed to cook with canola oil for decades as "healthy".

If you listened to them and did that for past 2 decades, your body is a pit of inflammation at this point.

2950 2018-12-22 17:59:11 The evidence is clear that shale didn’t tank the price of oil.  KSA/OPEC policy (whether intentional non intentional) caused the oversupply.  Shale growth didn’t help but could have been absorbed easily.

2987 2018-12-22 17:54:50 To me yeah or I’ll have my humidifier going with some type of essential oil in it its peaceful clear the air but everybody don’t like how sage smell
2988 2018-12-22 17:54:43 oil sands is under 3% and oil sands EXPANSION (mines, pipelines) is less than 1%. it is that expansion that is the first thing to stop (while transitioning workers).
2989 2018-12-22 17:54:41 Hey @AnnCoulter

I got this snake oil for you. It will turn all Dems into Republicans and all POC will become White. 

Guaranteed it will work.

Just give me 0.11% of your income.

I’m waiting.
2990 2018-12-22 17:54:26 So you are in favor of our troops invading a sovereign nation trying to force regime change & secure a competing oil pipeline?
2991 2018-12-22 17:54:22 Oilash pulchra, udh campuran castor oil, almond oil. Mantul juga
2992 2018-12-22 17:54:16 If you're gonna give someone oil it should be something useful like piri piri oil at least then you can make good chicken or something
2993 2018-12-22 17:54:13 I’m out here changing oil and givin out clean line ups lol
2994 2018-12-22 17:54:12 Jill Stein, the leader of the "Green" Party, sat at the same table as the man who dedicates his life to ensuring that alternative energy never replaces the oil that his country's economy depends on.  

Jill Stein voters - you got played.
2995 2018-12-22 17:54:04 Jill Stein, the leader of the "Green" Party, sat at the same table as the man who dedicates his life to ensuring that alternative energy never replaces the oil that his country's economy depends on.  

Jill Stein voters - you got played.
2996 2018-12-22 17:54:04 He sent it in middle of the night unmarked plane then lied about it. Then said it was payment from like the 70’s?  I do appreciate your calm tone and support clean energy in time when available at reasonable cost but for now oil & natural gas are king for economic stability
2997 2018-12-22 17:54:03 Is he sure it wasn’t snake oil?
2998 2018-12-22 17:54:00 I have TMJ disorder and I wake up like that a lot. I rub peppermint oil on the bottom of my chin and jaw line. That usually helps me. You can also put some heat on it.
2999 2018-12-22 17:53:53 Jesus Christ. Steel slats. With spikes. How about some well positioned catapults and buckets of hot oil too.
3000 2018-12-22 17:53:52 Some time in 2016 or 2017 oil stick paintings felt like giving up
3001 2018-12-22 17:53:47 Really?! Lovely ... I’m on the side of universal healthcare not being bargained off because some Dem owes a favor to the insurance Industry... or not adopting a green deal because they own stock in oil and gas ... etc ... no for profit Dems period ... That is the progressive side
3002 2018-12-22 17:53:38 Rosemary laughs uncomfortably revealing her Lib bias saying we have to stop oil production eventually. Too bad
3003 2018-12-22 17:53:36 JUST the oil industry?  OMG!  Alberta gives Canada BILLIONS in transfer payment!!!  You really don’t give a shit!  Just like Liberals and Trudeau
3004 2018-12-22 17:53:36 I use an oil called serenity from doterra. I have TMJ and get baaad jaw pain. Since its accompanying w neck pain that might be your Cspine. Have you been checked for spinal stenosis?
3005 2018-12-22 17:53:27 Chanyeol looks like those body builders who coats themselves with those brownish yellowish oil for shows
3006 2018-12-22 17:53:27 oil and agriculture
3007 2018-12-22 17:53:27 Oh okay. Well, I will say that double cleansing has changed my life. I use one called Banila Co. Melts makeup clean off.  Sokoglam has greattt cleansers and oil cleansers.
3008 2018-12-22 17:53:23 I hate cars.  Been trying to reset the oil light for the past 30 minutes with no luck
3009 2018-12-22 17:53:13 I’m also going to try olive oil
Though after the vinegar it really seems like I’m making throat salad
3010 2018-12-22 17:53:09 Let us help Waorani land free from oil!
3011 2018-12-22 17:53:08 And that’s what it should be use for! Especially if it really helps. I’ll personally look into more herbs and cbd oil since I have a bad leg/ankle.
3012 2018-12-22 17:52:43 I wonder whatever happened to that horrid indomie with the nasty palm oil and chicken chunks that they rolled out some months ago ...
3013 2018-12-22 17:52:41 oil will go up up up
3014 2018-12-22 17:52:40 Im so upset tea tree oil kenapa cpt habis
3015 2018-12-22 17:52:39 Smokin dick if you think I'm paying $80 for an oil change, I'll do that shit my damn self FOH
3016 2018-12-22 17:52:29 Hey girl I’ve been using olive oil it smells funny but it helps. Your hair is gorgeous it will grow back fast.
3017 2018-12-22 17:52:24 btw gue mau rekom bgt face oil: hemp seed oil. 

comedogenicnya rating 0, which means non pore clogged. Linoleic acidnya juga tinggi bet, molekulnya cukup kecil jadi bisa menyerap ke pori2 dg dahsyat. bagus banget buat memperbaiki tekstur kulit.
3018 2018-12-22 17:52:10 Airlines have been dropping in December while oil prices have been collapsing. Something does not add up here.
3019 2018-12-22 17:52:07 What again is the Crude oil price benchmark?  I am curious why they keep quoting it in USD. Do we buy Petrol in $$?  Help me out, my friend.
3020 2018-12-22 17:52:04 
You should buy some of that snake oil he's selling, too. I heard it cures naitivity. LOL
3021 2018-12-22 17:52:03 aahhhh I'd really love to see more of this, for real!  it's lovely
I never tried zinc tbh, but I did paint a lot on brass (G O L D E N) and copper plates, but with oil. we were lucky a professor started studying it and decided to teach us!!
3022 2018-12-22 17:52:00 Maybe CBD oil would help?
3023 2018-12-22 17:51:53 “Wonder Boy”, really? More apt epithets will be Disaster Boy, Terrorists Appeasing Boy, Spineless in front of USA Boy, Imposing senseless Carbon Tax Boy, Refugee Burden Boy, Lax Border control Boy, Islamaphoic Boy, Alberta Oil Pipeline Wrecker Boy, and so on.
3024 2018-12-22 17:51:51 My ire is directed at the government, I don’t care what the industry wants or needs. Big oil expects profits, capitalism right? I expected much more from Justin on this issue and the environment in general, it was a huge let-down. The 1.6B was a punch in the nose.
3025 2018-12-22 17:51:50 Bull...the world oil market has collapsed... Drug Fraud's policies have nothing to do with current oil/gas prices...quit lying like a rug.
3026 2018-12-22 17:51:44 first time doing a hot oil treatment in a looonggg time. gotta start back doing these more often
3027 2018-12-22 17:51:35 Powell is doing just what he is paid to do, which is driving interest rates lower by sacrificing the stock market to save the Fed's Bond Book. While keeping the economy alive by attacking oil to stimulate a wounded economy. It's a sick game but the Fed has a 4 Trillion bond book.
3028 2018-12-22 17:51:29 Was it packed I gotta get an oil change smh
3029 2018-12-22 17:51:29 Olive oil makes everything better.
3030 2018-12-22 17:51:14 I suppose the idea of quantitative easing wasn’t snake oil economics?
3031 2018-12-22 17:51:14 Gigi Gorgeous really won the game. Began as a gay Canadian YouTube star, transitioned and looks flawless, and now she’s married to a family of billionaire oil tycoons. Yes hennnyyy
3032 2018-12-22 17:50:55 Oil
3033 2018-12-22 17:50:32 Puerto Ricans inject the hell out of our w Goya seasonings, recaito, baste for like half a day in more seasonings, vinger, oil and garlic. 

It's off the hook for some black/Spanish/Sicilian and European mix breeds  oh n most of us look white. (blessed not privilaged) 
3034 2018-12-22 17:50:27 “I like all violence. Especially the messy parts and the tearing things up parts.”

“You smell like death and alcohol and masturbation and sex and gun oil.”
3035 2018-12-22 17:50:27 I don't invest in these fake news companies! I only invest in beautiful coal, oil, and TRUMP!
3036 2018-12-22 17:50:14 always keep da coconut oil on ya night stand
3037 2018-12-22 17:50:09 I have seen the same. I think it is all to do with bang-for-buck. Maximum calorie yield for minimum effort. Fresh sunflower seeds will be full of oil for good calorie boost, with no time or energy spent de-shelling them. @leicester_llama
3038 2018-12-22 17:50:04 I went and got an oil change once, and as soon as I left my battery died (my car was brand new with all new parts). So, i went to get a new battery and found out the place where I got my oil changed switched it with a super old one.
3039 2018-12-22 17:49:59 Part 61 f8. The Kingdom of Saudi Arbia and Qatar's plans for project (A) a direct pipeline from their gas and oil fields through Iraq and on into Turkey were dead. Fore Obama and Democrats crsated a void by pulling out to soon.
3040 2018-12-22 17:49:57 He who is without oil shall throw the first rod
Compressions 8.7:1
3041 2018-12-22 17:49:43 Did you read the other tweets? Because oil industry companies “require” them to do it. That’s why federal law requires them to report it. It’s a loophole for corporations to donate huge chunks of money that apparently seems perfectly innocent to outsiders. It’s the same as PAC 
3042 2018-12-22 17:49:38 Imagine splashing 100+ in January for signings .. the Oil money never dries.
3043 2018-12-22 17:49:35 My boyfriend in Ghana got married yesterday. I can’t rinse him of his oil money when I get to Ghana now. Kmt
3044 2018-12-22 17:49:32 Just got in a good sweat this morning while listening to Ice Cube. Now time for a protein shake and a lil @NaturesUltra citrus CBD oil. #SaturdayMorning #rapmusic #icecube #CBDlife #natural #pure #TeamIsEverything #RavensFlock
3045 2018-12-22 17:49:30 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
3046 2018-12-22 17:49:14 Does that include foreign oil from Africa and the Middle East, cement factories in Quebec and sewage dumping in the St. Lawrence?
3047 2018-12-22 17:49:09 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
3048 2018-12-22 17:49:09 tell me madarchod how much you get paid for this negetivity ? is your boyfriend #KaranJohar behind your back and your gaand ? bhadwe 1.1/2 to daku ki film ko bhi nahi dete.teri maa ko jaroor kali choudas ke din chouda hoga bina oil lagaye #aajtak18 #ndtv #sahara
3049 2018-12-22 17:48:55 There wasn't any oil at Citeh
3050 2018-12-22 17:48:53 No, Oil and Gas funded the Unemployment lines throughout UK, allowing Thatcher to close Coal Mines and dismantle our industrial base.
3051 2018-12-22 17:48:49 I need to do laundry, I need to mop, I need to wash dishes, I need to eat, I need to wash and oil Zurri hair.. all of this but I just wanna sleep 
3052 2018-12-22 17:48:43 Or an oil
3053 2018-12-22 17:48:34 I'm really scared about using oil on my face :( I think I'll try the aloe sheet masks from sephora
3054 2018-12-22 17:48:28 وحياتك لولا قلبو عالناس كان مشي من زمان
3055 2018-12-22 17:48:23 Why is everyone and their mom and dad getting an oil change today 
3056 2018-12-22 17:48:13 I'm trying to be nice here, but ok, I'll go for a gentle schooling instead.

How many billions has Alberta made off oil alone in, oh, say, even just the last 50 years?
3057 2018-12-22 17:47:55 Carbon tax to fight climate change, not just oil tax
3058 2018-12-22 17:47:42 im just abt to make smth in the crock pot and it says to grease it so olive oil is better than that nasty ass cooking spray also ive actually never used it before now
3059 2018-12-22 17:47:32 Body lotion, Double Clenser - Hobo cleansing oil.

I'll get this both, soon.
3060 2018-12-22 17:47:31 I like the fact that he realizes that in today’s political climate, you have to move a little closer to centre with your views if you are going to get Junior out. He’s a huge oil patch supporter. He has a fantastic team behind him and I TRUST him. I DO NOT trust Max.
3061 2018-12-22 17:47:28 コンビニで酒とつまみを買ってるいい感じに酔った男女がいて、いいから飲み直さずにそのままベッドへなだれ込みなされ、と思っていたら男がキムチに手を伸ばしていて、…なるほど、という気持ちになった。
3062 2018-12-22 17:47:28 पहले कहते थे पेट्रोल 40 रु लीटर से भी कम होगा, सत्ता में आने पर Crude Oil सस्ता हो जाने के बाद भी पेट्रोल की कीमतें बढ़ती ही गईं।

कहते थे $ के मुकाबले रु मजबूत होगा, मजबूती तो दूर नई गहराइयों तक गिर गया।
3063 2018-12-22 17:47:27 No...  How could you, get in line with whatever oil company shill the Democrats decided to run this time or you're clearly a Russian agent who loves Trump
3064 2018-12-22 17:47:15 think of the oil paint. Think of the pizza. It will b okay
3065 2018-12-22 17:47:08 The cash during the 08 crisis was needed and unfortunately lost as GM took the handout and ran. Most in the west can’t imagine Trudeau as anything but a villain because his dad was hard on oil. Get over it already. 50 years and still crying. Alberta pissed away all that cash.
3066 2018-12-22 17:47:06 We have a huge line of Essential Oils and beautiful Essential Oil Diffusers! They make great Christmas gifts.
3067 2018-12-22 17:47:03 หมูทะข้ามปี
3068 2018-12-22 17:47:00 I’ll be downtown to watch the Preds game as soon as this oil change is done. DM me for more info on how to make the transfer.
3069 2018-12-22 17:46:54 They should and anyone else who has a greater stake there. We are supposed to be energy independent now. Let them  protect their oil interests.
3070 2018-12-22 17:46:53 โด่ววว55555
3071 2018-12-22 17:46:52 He forgot the part where a @JustinTrudeau majority and continued LPC obstructions to a healthy oil and gas industry sets off a chain of events that leads to The Republic of Western Canada.
3072 2018-12-22 17:46:50 I dont understand people who criticise chicha etc etc. This is the side with most quality we’ve had in a very very long time. People forget that it took 4 years even for citeh to do something remarkable even with their oil lord sugardaddies we are work in progress 
3073 2018-12-22 17:46:47 I need to start using castor oil on my hair and eyelashes tbh
3074 2018-12-22 17:46:45 When I gotta go get an oil change  why I wait so late
3075 2018-12-22 17:46:43 Woy!!! Mending rendem kaki pake air anget dan oil daripada minum2 begitu kutakut:(
3076 2018-12-22 17:46:21 kakain na ako ulit sa mang inasal kapag wala ng chicken oil shortage 
3077 2018-12-22 17:46:13 I came to get an oil change at letis job and I also did a surprise visit , she blushed it was cute
3078 2018-12-22 17:46:12 President Obama, yet don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
3079 2018-12-22 17:46:02 The utter self delusion. He sells the snake oil to himself.
3080 2018-12-22 17:46:00 Please stop calling it “Western Alienation”. Alberta isn’t even the real west. And many of us in the real west are tired of Alberta complaining about problems that are the result of their own mistakes including letting the oil industry run their province.
3081 2018-12-22 17:46:00 Cut yam lengthwise
Line baking sheet w/parchment
Drizzle olive oil on parchment, then coarse salt
Lay yams on cookie sheet
Bake @ 400 20 min, test for fork tender.
Roasting brings out natural sugars, no need for sweet w/it.
3082 2018-12-22 17:45:40 Let's ALL just remember, the United States NEVER decided to intervene in Syria because of ISIS. They assisted rebels (who later joined ISIS) in trying to overthrow the elected government (presumably because they wanted a friendly Govt who would give them the oil).
3083 2018-12-22 17:45:36 Western Europe wants the oil, now that France's TOTAL Oil has abandoned the $4.8billion it invested in Iranian Oil&Gas I believe France ( and others) are back to the Saudi-Qatar pipeline. Perhaps they will try to negotiate an agreement with Assad this time.

3085 2018-12-22 17:45:24 As a non-American I have very strong views that the American military should not be in most of the oil prosperous countries they are fighting in ... but my concern is an unplanned withdrawal
3086 2018-12-22 17:45:21 The sociopaths who want to sell you grain oil (corn), bean oil (soy), & grass oil ("canola") lie that they are "#vegetable" oil. It's actually 2 lies in one, b/c they are not #vegetables , and they are not healthy. #diet
3087 2018-12-22 17:45:14 I need an oil change
3088 2018-12-22 17:45:00 กวนเก่ง
3089 2018-12-22 17:44:37 A Must Read Article.  Nikola Tesla gave us Free Electro Magnetic Energy.  The same Rothschild Rulers hid the technology.  It takes $$ to control the whole planet.  We do not NEED oil but they do.  Anyone who creates patents for a better world are silenced.  Know the Enemy.
3090 2018-12-22 17:44:25 someone just got oil on my NEW makeup bag i hate life pls help
3091 2018-12-22 17:44:18 IN USA AND ACROSS THE WORLD HAVE HONNEST PEOPLE, BUT RICH COUNTRIES LIVE ON BACK OF THE POOR WORLD . NATURAL REASUORCES IS ALWAYS BEEN HIS TARGET, MINDS, OIL FIELD,MINERALS, AGRAR LAND. COLONIALISAM AND IMPERIALISAM IS CLAVER COVERED WITH STORY OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS.
3092 2018-12-22 17:44:09 Let oil be 500 Dollars per barrel today, APC will still give reasons why they would not perform. The problem we have is not the price of oil,  it is incompetency & nepotism. Countries without oil are progressing. PDP generated revenue they used,  APC should generate theirs & use.
3093 2018-12-22 17:44:01 I have said it times without number that anyone supporting APC must have killed his/her conscience. Always lying at every given opportunity.
"16 years of good oil revenue".
3094 2018-12-22 17:43:55 Blount caught a pass for a TD in a regular season game against the Colts some years ago. It was at Lucas Oil but the original tweet doesn’t seem to specify that it has to be at Gillette.
3095 2018-12-22 17:43:52 Believe all that started over Harkin Energy oil concession in Kuwait owned by Bushes
3096 2018-12-22 17:43:45 When we don’t seek their oil, their money, their regional significance or their influence.
3097 2018-12-22 17:43:43 Her first step is to boycott all oil products & walk the talk. Then she might have a shred of credibility. Nobody is forcing you to consume oil products, you do this because they add quality to your life.
3098 2018-12-22 17:43:41 Went to a doctors appt, got an oil change, ran errands, went grocery shopping now I’m cooking for tonight’s festivities. Ok Gen, slow down there lol
3099 2018-12-22 17:43:41 หายแล้วครับ กินเยอะไปหน่อย
3100 2018-12-22 17:43:05 I discovered that CBD oil comes down like a hammer on my leg pain. I was able to walk like a normal person yesterday for the first time in months.
3101 2018-12-22 17:43:01 I’ve been setting my make up w lavender and rose hip oil and I feel like a queen
3102 2018-12-22 17:42:56 Waiting to get a fucking oil change 
3103 2018-12-22 17:42:55 Yes. Over drying your skin produces more oil to make up for the oil not being there.
3104 2018-12-22 17:42:52 no .. like ... they have olive oil. in a can
3105 2018-12-22 17:42:52 I like & respect Chomsky, but I disagree with him about Syria. The US should seek assurances that their Kurdish allies won’t be attacked, but its complicated because the Kurds (with US backing) seized control of important oil wells that the Syrian government wants back #oilwars

3107 2018-12-22 17:42:36 How about new jobs in green energy and technology? Or how dedicated are you to getting paid by big oil?
3108 2018-12-22 17:42:35 March 2018 Top Tweet #10 

PENTANOVA Energy PNO to reach Total Depth on 1st Colombia Gas Well This Week by 24March. 3MM-18MMft3 nat gas potential. Shares 30 cents, warrants 13 cents (expire 2022). Upon success, could mean acres of oil at 50 cent cost per barrel in $60 bbl enviro

3110 2018-12-22 17:42:24 I dont work in the oil fields but I am a lineman and make 6 figures per year and have for the 8 years without going to a 4 year university
3111 2018-12-22 17:42:21 if it makes u feel better i have a whole bottle of Real olive oil at my apartment too so
3112 2018-12-22 17:42:16 Sure. Canadian Business, Alberta Oil Magazine, Hart Energy Publications of Houston, Vancouver Magazine, National Post, Financial Post, and numerous magazines and news sites that have re-published my columns. Accredited by Canadian govts, corporations, etc.
3113 2018-12-22 17:42:14 Good.  This is how it should be. Countries in the region protecting each other. Given that most of N. America was once covered by shallow seas and very close to Equator for millions of years, a steamy swamp, we have plenty of oil, coal or natural gas. Plus, innovation.
3114 2018-12-22 17:42:11 it seems like that should be the other way around
3115 2018-12-22 17:42:09 Honestly just need to take the day to myself and get my overdue oil change and have fun but I guess I gotta go to work and I’ll see a day off next month
3116 2018-12-22 17:41:52 YES! I used to break out pretty badly and my oil control.. well there was no control  and now my acne is non existant (except that time of month. I dont think even God himself can stop those) and I have little problem with oily skin!
3117 2018-12-22 17:41:49 Me either, however I knew that a passel was racist, greedy, stupid, ignorant, and impressed by snake oil salesmen
3118 2018-12-22 17:41:39 Coconut oil IS very good but I find Silcocks covers the "water and oil" part of moisturising as opposed to just the oil.  And it's quite a bit cheaper in terms of volume. Coconut oil is great in baths and on dry hair also though.
3119 2018-12-22 17:41:36 Koch + Oil + Russia +Tea Party + bribes, graft, fake charities, Citizens United and ALEC = Oligarchic Kleptocracy of the USA

3128 2018-12-22 17:40:43 You are saying that Turkey should take care of ISIS remains.
It’s like a joke.
It was Turkey delivered weapons to ISIS, buying Oil from ISIS, helped ISIS to get Musil.
At the war of Kobani, Turkey was directly with ISIS....there is camera footages.
No jailed ISIS member in Turkey

3131 2018-12-22 17:39:50 Also, starting to phase out oil, like every other economically advances country is doing, is feasable... Only idiots argue it's all oil or nothing. It means you don't understand the argument at all.

3135 2018-12-22 17:39:22 It used to be when Stevie GBH was there but Liverpool are the only team to stop the oil nonces winning the league. Man City have built nothing and been given everything. Liverpool get my backing.
3136 2018-12-22 17:39:12 nearby. Syrian army had crossed Euphrates at Deir Ezzor after series of wins over ISIS. About to defeat ISIS east of Euphrates. US stopped advance by bombing Syrian army and Russians. US then seized oil fields that would have aided Syrian economic rebuild. Reprehensible.

3143 2018-12-22 17:37:54 Then why are we doing business with them
Mexico is our number 2 Trading partner and in the top four oil exporters to the US
And receive billions of dollars from the us
When the minimum wage in Mexico his $10 a day
3144 2018-12-22 17:37:54 Terrible, even worse is Canola oil. Canola is made from a hybrid plant developed by Monsanto. Straight up garbage.
3145 2018-12-22 17:37:38 This matter is much more complicated than you think. They are our supporters to us and to Israel and help to keep peace in that region. Not to mention they control the worlds oil prices. We do billions of dollars in business every year with them. It is a delicate situation.
3146 2018-12-22 17:37:35 Well, this should help crude oil ..

3152 2018-12-22 17:37:09 Also, nuclear energy isn't exactly unfeasible and neither are things like hydro dams or wind and solar farms. And Canada has a massive surplus of oil in storage currently and guess whose lobbying the govt to spread misinformation to try and hold onto this bullshit? Big Oil!
3153 2018-12-22 17:36:58 Yes, but demand is more complex that 1 guy maxing his credit card. Takes 100s millions guys w/ same behavior & lots of time plus much consumer demand for oil inelastic.

Big component of demand is movement of stocks in & out of inventories—long value chain process.

3156 2018-12-22 17:36:36 Literally nothing about that entire tweet makes sense. The age, income or expenses. Only possibility I can think of is working oil fields in TX.

3160 2018-12-22 17:36:09 I haven’t heard many if anyone talking about oil prices and the high yield market. 2015-2016 it took away over 1% of GDP.
3161 2018-12-22 17:35:59 This is classic Liberal manipulation, let a guy into their club, use them up for political purposes and then distance themselves. Exactly what they did to Ford during Kavanaugh witch hunt.
3162 2018-12-22 17:35:58 That 300 billion bolivars had been embezzled as you claimed Tim Worstall, when @MaoistRebelNews was much closer to the real damage that capitalist appropriation of the oil rent.

3164 2018-12-22 17:35:52 Also worth noting that there were more donations under $200 from oil industry employees than there were at the max. A lot of people work in oil in Texas—glad to see some of them supported Beto over Ted.
3165 2018-12-22 17:35:24 Just to recapitulate - Dick Cheney's Iraq oil invasion (which @HillaryClinton voted for) created ISIS & spread it to Syria; the US indiscriminately bombed Syria for years before Russia arrived and armed al-Qaeda in Syria (which @HillaryClinton arranged). So why blame Trump?
3166 2018-12-22 17:35:22 Maybe you should look up how much oil companies have paid for environmental damages in the past. Or the fast growing green industry and how it's becoming increasingly profitable. You should also look up countries who lag during industrial and cultural revolutions.
3167 2018-12-22 17:35:16 I think we agree. Drill drill drill. Free market solutions to potential environmental disasters only curb lawsuits and worse yet knee jerk regulations. What oil company wouldn’t want to pool an oil leak under the platform?  They could quickly separate it and send it to market...
3168 2018-12-22 17:35:15 GE.  Oil che & Gas was created following the acquisitionof the Nuovo Pignone companyfrom ENI ; production ranges from compression systems for the extraction, refining and transportation of oil and gas; systems installed all over the world; from individual components like

3181 2018-12-22 17:33:29 It is not the FX falling that causes inflation .
More money spent on oil less to spend on sausages .It only affects relative prices ,not the general price level.Inflation can't be driven by wage spirals, trust me

However I doubt the crooked GOP would. They have to many personal investments in the oil companies!
3184 2018-12-22 17:33:09 The pledge is badly worded and excludes huge swaths of individuals like me who are progressive yet work in the oil/gas industry. This is being used as an excuse to attack a perceived political threat. Your position is problematic.

3189 2018-12-22 17:32:28 If you're referring to Bill C-69, it is not clear to me exactly what the oil patch is complaining about.  Do they want to trample indigenous rights?  Forget about the environment?  Not let Canadians have a say?
3190 2018-12-22 17:32:28 Killing people for Israel, oil pipelines, and the Rothschild Banking System tends to aggravate people.

3196 2018-12-22 17:31:29 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
3197 2018-12-22 17:31:24 I would only add you need whole plant oil, not hemp oil, which is not legal in Ind. So if testing is an issue.....
But I'm a huge proponent of cannabis. Legalizing it would change my life.

3200 2018-12-22 17:30:51 Absolutely agree with that. I was more referring to the more recent trauma to the industry. I also agree that the oil lobby would be large supporters of Harper's. No different then saying that the current legislation regarding pipelines etc are being written by environmentalists.
3201 2018-12-22 17:30:20 I will let you in to a secret... The lorry body is 24v and the tractor is 12v so at moment we have no decks!!!! Hydraulic people coming on Monday to convert to full oil !!!
3202 2018-12-22 17:30:07 @Jeep so I bought my Jeep into jeep service center because I was leaking a lot of oil. They fixed it saying it was a oil switch ($400) they told me it was good to go! I went on a little road trip 400 miles and when I returned I was still leaking a lot of oil.

3216 2018-12-22 17:28:38 My hair grows really slowly esp as it's very curly, so I'm fussy about it now, and it's so dry even when in its 100% natural state, I oil it. It takes three 40 vol bleachings to get it beyond ginger. So I *really* must use Olaplex if I do it again. You've def. tempted me though!
3217 2018-12-22 17:28:36 Yes, but it'll be thinner
If you somehow have oil around, a little bit of that can thicken it back up

3222 2018-12-22 17:27:59 Obama just bragged about how much oil he got the US to produce. That's not a great strategy for the future.

3227 2018-12-22 17:27:32 Chrismation and Eucharist. I know a lot of folk who believe in infant baptism but keep Eucharist from their children until they reach a certain age or level of maturity. We anoint with oil at baptism and many (though not all) introduce the bread and wine. Full initiation is right

3234 2018-12-22 17:27:05 YUP!  Dupont, started producing it, 1937, right after it, hemp, was lumped into the "drug" category, in 1936.  You hit the nail on the head.  Most don't know that!  I loved terminology of its medicinal value, esp. CBD oil, how it is not addictive, proven safe, non toxic by FDA.
3235 2018-12-22 17:27:04 Trump allegedly took the decision after a telephone conversation with Erdogan. It’s heaven for the Syrian people, hopefully they can rebuild the country using the oil proceeds with Western sanctions on Syria strangling its economy et al.
3236 2018-12-22 17:26:46 I'd suggest a 10% tariff on non-USA imported oil, along with accelerated write offs to eastern refineries to add heavy oil upgrader capacity to their plants.  Then you'll see Quebec and Maritime refineries actually EXPORT upgraded oil, instead of importing it.
3237 2018-12-22 17:26:39 AB'ers spend their oil money on American made pickups.
3238 2018-12-22 17:26:31 They really tried charging me $200 for an oil change LMAOOO I’ll do it myself 
3239 2018-12-22 17:26:30 Executives from the oil industry giving thousands of dollars in donations are a distinct category of donor, which is an obvious enough distinction that Beto himself signed a pledge to not accept that category of donation, and subsequently broke that pledge. 1

3248 2018-12-22 17:25:14 Note that the Canadian oil lobby literally wrote parts of Harper's environmental legislation. Much of the oil patch has been quite profitable.  The crash in oil prices in 2015 was not due to the environmental lobby.

3253 2018-12-22 17:24:53 Alberta is sick of being eastern Canadas source of funds.  We have kept this country going for years.  We get no support for our oil from @JustinTrudeau at all.  So of course there is talk of separation.  He is forcing our hand.
3254 2018-12-22 17:24:49 How is oil generated in the earth? That's a good question. Any other object without a mirrored surface at our distance from the sun would climb to 249 degrees F, but the earth surface averages 59 degrees F.  The difference is a lot of energy that is probably used to create oil.
3255 2018-12-22 17:24:35 "I smoked weed and oil haha"
3256 2018-12-22 17:24:34 Castor Oil got my nose all up in the air. I’m so moisturized right now
3257 2018-12-22 17:24:33 So yeah my dumb ass cracked the oil pan in my friends BMW race car. $200+ gone out the bank account  and I get to help take the motor out just to replace the damn thing. God what is you doing??
3258 2018-12-22 17:24:31 During the Three Day Week, there were rota power cuts and reduced broadcasting across the UK to preserve power due to the Oil Shock and the miners' strike.
3259 2018-12-22 17:24:24 No one trusts the US especially when we fund and train you today and abandon you tomorrow. And then two administrations from now you’re the enemy because your sheep graze where the new oil pipeline goes
3260 2018-12-22 17:24:14 Its about time for another hot oil treatment
3261 2018-12-22 17:24:08 If you think Zola would be a good manager I feel for you deeply.

Remember that one time you won something without oil money?

Oh you probably weren't born
3262 2018-12-22 17:23:51 Either RahulGandhi is so stupid that he hasn't a clue regarding what does he speak abt or those buying his snake oil r stuck in a cult.Regardless, his complete destruction of democracy r beyond horrific. @NitishKumar @MSufiSaint @alok_ajay @AmitShah
3263 2018-12-22 17:23:40 Hey selling snake oil is a profession too. Don’t judge.
3264 2018-12-22 17:23:32 Jon I like your tweets but this is daft. In the last election a large part of why Corbyn got close was remainers lending their votes to deny May a blank cheque, myself included. I will not fall for the again, the man is another snake oil salesmen.
3265 2018-12-22 17:23:30 First took 20 mins to find the tires I bought and was gonna charge me again. Is that not in your system?? Now going on 3.5 hours to install them and get an oil change. Everyone in the waiting room has come and gone. Please remind me never to use @pepboysauto again!!!! 
3266 2018-12-22 17:23:30 Yea , they would rather an oil money club to win.
3267 2018-12-22 17:23:25 @IanBrzezinski How come no media discuss, the real truth, of our involvment in this malaise, the mid east.
RIP George sr.
Germany, Kosovo, I get.
But oil, Kuwait.
Cmon media?
Short memories.
Vietnam, school shootings, etc etc.
Weak!
3268 2018-12-22 17:23:20 But that is the situation on ground for a very long time. The village has been in darkness for several months. The transformer has been brought back and the villagers were asked to contribute money for oil. And it's 280k. Investigate this please.

3269 2018-12-22 17:23:20 Governor of Khouzestan province: Iranian #oil industry's dependence on imported spare parts at lowest level as more universities join efforts to make spare parts incld drilling equipment. #Iran
3270 2018-12-22 17:23:06 And what is the main industry in BC Northeast... Oil and Gas I know Mr Weaver said there are lots of green jobs but I haven't heard what green jobs there are outside of the lower mainland
3271 2018-12-22 17:22:58 If you could only read French. It's not a deliberate slant. Oil tax was the last straw after ALL the crappy policies that benefit the wealthy and corporations.
3272 2018-12-22 17:22:27 They go to the campus. Use the facility. Gossip. Some do research. 
But Christmas period like this, they share Christmas rice and oil. 
No lectures at all.
3273 2018-12-22 17:22:26 Good point. I'll ask specifically now how they track. I assumed they use the odometer. As that's what they use for maint items (oil changes, tires, etc). But they could be telling me the uber app miles. Good point to make a finer ask around that.
3274 2018-12-22 17:22:23 Must be nice! #SoakUpTheSun and #FeelTheHeat enjoy your day .@heatherbob45 don't get burned oil up!
3275 2018-12-22 17:22:18 forgot about the oil in the kadhai that i had kept for frying  kadhai went in flames. chimney went in flames fkdkdk my dumbass threw cold water on it??  the power of the entire house went out and everything was black i-
3276 2018-12-22 17:22:16 When will the squeaky wheel get the oil?
3277 2018-12-22 17:22:11 Finally a poll I care about. Roasted with olive oil, sea salt, rosemary etc.
3278 2018-12-22 17:21:59 ก็มีแค่คนกลุ่มเดียว
3279 2018-12-22 17:21:57 Can’t negotiate with a snake oil con man
3280 2018-12-22 17:21:55 We have enough oil that I guess I should be nervous now.
3281 2018-12-22 17:21:42 .....
3282 2018-12-22 17:21:42 How does it have a slightly smaller engine than the trans am but takes double the oil German engineering amiright
3283 2018-12-22 17:21:42 I’ve been finally getting everything I wanted. My glass waist beads are coming , my yoni egg is on its way, my tarot cards . Im so excited!!!  my “Mmm…” oil is being paid for today! & im still saving money!!! 
3284 2018-12-22 17:20:54 Мне понравилось видео "TECH - Electric car with oil disc brakes part 4 - Car steering system"
3285 2018-12-22 17:20:41 Right, indoctrination. I recall a science lab from the 80s where we were given bitumen and had to build an apparatus to extract the oil. 
3286 2018-12-22 17:20:26 And the US environmental lobby killed the pipelines and oilpatch in Canada. They made us non competitive so that we gave them oil at a massive discount which they refine and sell for much more.
3287 2018-12-22 17:20:21 I use that CBD oil top up with space monkey weed  only thing,, it’s £70 a tin in Scotland 
3288 2018-12-22 17:20:14 Gomez and Trent are mainstays, in fact Gomez is as important as any player in our current squad ..we don’t have oil resources remember. We’ve also had Mane, Matip, Lovren, clyne, Milner, lallana, Henderson and Keita out for periods of time.
3289 2018-12-22 17:20:12 Maybe not, want he the one who bragged about making America an oil exporter or something?
3290 2018-12-22 17:20:12 True. But dont forget a significant portion of the manufacturing sectors GDP exists to support energy but isn’t reflected in the 10%. Also, dont forget that somethig like 25% of Canadas export is oil. Strip that away and we move closer to trade deficit territory.
3291 2018-12-22 17:20:08 In 1800's Hemp was the largest Cash Export for US.. Used in rope, paper, clothing etc. Oil for Lamps and medicine.  1970's Big Pharma, bad drugs.. Thank you!
3292 2018-12-22 17:20:01 Cory Gardner forgot a long time ago that he is supposed to work for us and not Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Ag, Big Corps and worst of all Big Fat Trump. 
Precisely why he needs to be retired by us, the PEOPLE of Colorado, in 2020.
3293 2018-12-22 17:19:57 The war in Syria is about oil pipelines. We've been deliberately escalating racial & religions tensions to overthrow Assad government in order to get them.

"Russian propaganda"

IT'S ON THE CIA'S WEBSITE! Read their declassified docs!

*blank stare... "Conspiracy Theorist"

SMDH
3294 2018-12-22 17:19:34 Of course he does because War is big money, and we are footing the bill in rich oil laden lands. How long are we suppose to fight in a civil war losing precious American lives.  This is no surprise he made this promise long ago.  Stop the war machine.
3295 2018-12-22 17:19:15 Yeah I rarely get blowouts, probably once a year. my hair sucks up oil so fast

Nut butter yes
3300 2018-12-22 17:18:35 Apakah sdh saat nya memiliki posisi beli pada harga Oil? Bagaimana dengan Emas? Sdh kembali lepas naik dari level $1,250
3301 2018-12-22 17:18:31 Don’t get me wrong. I love my job. But I’ve had worse rooms before. And gagged. Blood on sheets and towels, ADULT shit on the floor and in the garbage, food everywhere (and I mean EVERYWHERE), oil spilled all over carpets, etc.

3303 2018-12-22 17:18:23 Soooo, we had to leave the car at the dealership. Possibly starter or alternator yet they don't have anyone except oil & tire guys there until Monday. We rented a car - a Jeep.  Whatever happens happens.
3304 2018-12-22 17:18:12 And when I got out of that, beyond a doubt in his dreams; but the smell of oil was all great wizards, father and grandfather kept before me.
3305 2018-12-22 17:18:09 Ordered for a hair oil product in Snapdeal.. never used snapdeal before, but it looked like some irresistible deal.. they delivered a fake product.
3306 2018-12-22 17:18:04 lmaoooooooo wtf plus that’s so much effort and wasted oil??? dunno where some ppl get the gall to ask for shit like that honestly i felt like a piece of shit sending back tempuradon that they’d covered in whitebait even though i’d asked them not to put it on cos i’ll die
3307 2018-12-22 17:17:55 Sage your room/house and or about your room with oil.
3308 2018-12-22 17:17:51 Are you sure that it wasn't snake oil?
3309 2018-12-22 17:17:48 Any update on this: On 15 February 2012, two Indian fishermen were killed off the coast of Kerala, India, aboard the St. Antony. India alleged that the two Italian marines aboard the Italian-flagged commercial oil tanker MV Enrica Lexie killed the fishermen.
3310 2018-12-22 17:17:37 I agree and I also agree to get the hell out of Syria.  They only care about their oil fields.  Yeah and they should pay our country for all the expense we put out to orotecg them.  Our soldiers should also be paid by them additional funds.
3311 2018-12-22 17:17:36 หนีไปนอนดีกว่าาา
3312 2018-12-22 17:17:31 LADIES DO NOT GO TO NTB FOR NOTHINGGGG!!! 11041 E FWY THEY WILL TRY TO SCAM YOU FOR YOUR MONEY. I went for an oil change for 45$ and they tried to come up with some bs that I have to pay 1,000 etc.... luckily my bf checked that shit
3313 2018-12-22 17:17:29 What? The French aren't fighting for oil pipelines? #ViveLaPipelineLibre
3314 2018-12-22 17:17:25 I think you’re trying to say it’s a non-renewable resource. It’s not dying, it will simply run out at some point in time in the relatively near future. It’s in demand more than ever. $ are leaving this country as we export our oil at $40/barrel less then the rest of the world.
3315 2018-12-22 17:17:14 ไม่เอาสิพี่นท ใจบางหมดละ555

3317 2018-12-22 17:17:03 Sharks with freakin shock collars!
3318 2018-12-22 17:16:57 Oil company employee contributions are fossil fuel money 

Then federal govt employee contributions are Trump money?
3319 2018-12-22 17:16:55 I don’t know if it’ll help your back pain specifically, but in November I began using CBD Oil. it’s been a huge help pain wise.
(Can be bought at Holland & Barrett: At £30, it’s expensive, but I’d never look back).

Hope you find something that works soon
3320 2018-12-22 17:16:51 no world power is quiet...but oil requirement is making them silent.....these Muslim countries have oil..... otherwise Christians have no such special love towards Muslims....and some humanitarian organizations have also their roles.....
3321 2018-12-22 17:16:50 Just burnt my hand with some hot ass oil ... Like whyyyy are these things happening to me ? This shiit hurts ahhh 
3322 2018-12-22 17:16:48 Took my car in for a routine oil change the day before I drive home for Christmas. Picked it up and was told I need $500 in repairs and my car is undriveable until it’s fixed. Merry Christmas!
3323 2018-12-22 17:16:45 Has not been bought yet.  Fairly rare tumble in oil prices holding up deals in the space at present. 
Cash burn reduced by half in 2019 at $50 vs higher oil in 2018.  
EBITDA / BOE among best in group ... not tier 2.
But you making fun isn't conducive to conversation. Grow up.
3324 2018-12-22 17:16:45 Better secure them with catapults and boiling oil. 

This dude is borderline retarded even by 14th century standards.

3329 2018-12-22 17:16:17 Congratulations to American oil baron and real estate mogul Mark Ogren. We are lucky to have you.
3330 2018-12-22 17:16:14 I'm a Great Value brand guy 'til I die, but there's something depressing about using "Great Value Classic Olive Oil". There's not even a picture of an old Italian lady on it. Sad face.
3331 2018-12-22 17:16:12 Compare what tobacco did for society vs what oil and gas did.
3332 2018-12-22 17:15:45 Agree. Standard Oil was never one of my faves, but it loses its architectural integrity with this nonsense.

3334 2018-12-22 17:15:17 #JakeTheFake, stop lying to people. You're a snake oil salesman who knowingly miss leads your followers.

For example on GATT Article XXIV.

Now let's see who the snowflakes are.
3335 2018-12-22 17:15:17 Pineapple and olive oil on pizza is the best combo ever don't @ me
3336 2018-12-22 17:15:13 There’s at least a possibility of a placebo effect from snake oil. These people are donating money into something that won’t even reach the intended target.
3337 2018-12-22 17:15:06 Stopped voting for Labour when we invaded Iraq for USA & Blair. It was an illegal war,evidence was fabricated. Opened door for more terror in ME, it was all for oil. SNP gives us hope in-that we break from neocons who want world domination.We just want peace & get along with all
3338 2018-12-22 17:14:58 Getting an oil change.

3342 2018-12-22 17:14:47 why is an oil change for my car $80 
3343 2018-12-22 17:14:44 Kiddos coughing like mine? Give them a bath in some @doterra breathe oil, or rub some on their feet.  The cough literally disappears. It works for me as well. #BreatheBlend
3344 2018-12-22 17:14:40 No, I live in the oil patch and have been watching this process closely for a long time. The Cons were close to getting the NG thru. If they had got back in the patch would be in much better shape right now! I think you have watched listened to too much CBC!
3345 2018-12-22 17:14:39 my hair : *produces more oil than Oman and I'm almost going bald*

3347 2018-12-22 17:14:16 Lookit this "papaya extract, coconut oil" MFer right here!

You're looking great!
3348 2018-12-22 17:14:15 My favourite is once when I was asked to change the deep frying oil for one person's shiitake tempura.

I'm like... We fry oysters in this I bet you the entire machine is contaminated and no one's gonna sanitize it tonight. (seafood restaurant to begin with)
3349 2018-12-22 17:14:05 Translation: Here you go wealthy oil corporations. Here's more money to line your pockets with. Don't worry about those workers who have no money due to Christmas shutdowns. So long as *you're* happy. That's all that matters.

3351 2018-12-22 17:13:36 The American media always throws freedom and liberty in our faces and tries to camouflage its pipeline wars and wars for control over oil and natural gas with pretty imaginative pictures of liberty. "Liberty" is the toxic drink that blurs ones eyes from seeing the truth.

Why tax "consumption but not savings ie wealth"?

A poor guy consumes 80% of his income on food & essentials...a rich guy only 20%.

And why link oil prices to GST?

3388 2018-12-23 23:58:35 This a is something for Albertans should learn from.
The Conservatives basically gave Alberta’s oil riches to the billionaire oil barons.
The #UCP will continue this theft . #ableg #abpoli

3391 2018-12-23 23:58:11 When they tried to speak a word curse over your life in a moment of rage & jealousy but the oil on you won't allow it to stick
3392 2018-12-23 23:57:24 Hi Friends: Does anyone take CBD oil for anxiety? Gimme the deets?
3393 2018-12-23 23:57:22 Well, when I was young Olive Oil was the object of my affection.

3394 2018-12-23 23:57:15 Kirsten, is never late to learn. Besides reading is the oil that keeps your mind & body going.
3395 2018-12-23 23:57:04 Those are the other four players in the game. Oh, well Russia, too!

Forget people who want to attack us/hurt us, tho! What about a little tiny thing like oil/resources? Have us denied access to it, cut off, or get sweetheart deals from Kurdistan?

Pulling out of Syria = disaster
3396 2018-12-23 23:56:59 I live in London, Ont. and I don't have a truck but if the Feb 15th convoy gets to Ottawa I'm gonna be there. @PremierScottMoe there are many people in the east that support pipelines and western oil.
3397 2018-12-23 23:56:58 Moroccan oil... It's magical!
3398 2018-12-23 23:56:54 First batch, mustard greens with prosciutto olive oil, salt and pepper with a balsamic glaze drizzle.
3399 2018-12-23 23:56:51 Olive oil, salt, pepper, and sesame seeds?! What the hell is that? Where’s the smoked meat? Horrible
3400 2018-12-23 23:56:42 ITS LIKE IM BEING TIED TO A YELLOW RENTAL TRUCK BEING PACKED WITH FERTILIZER & FUEL OIL PUSHED OFF A CLIFF BY A SUICIDAL MICKEY MOUSE
3401 2018-12-23 23:56:39 Tune it up, communicate, and get that oil changed
3402 2018-12-23 23:56:37 Oil to break the seal. Coconut or olive.
3403 2018-12-23 23:56:33 What’s the Venn diagram look like for trump supporters and MLM esstenial oil entrepreneurs?
3404 2018-12-23 23:56:29 I put my cousins peppermint oil on my face (apparently not supposed to) now I can feel it in my eye and smell it everywhere gosh
3405 2018-12-23 23:56:16 I mean your work schedule is so strong I'm gonna need baby oil to sneak in
3406 2018-12-23 23:56:11 Are you even a fan!!1!1??? Grilled Italian no tomato xtra onions drown that bitch in oil & vinegar
3407 2018-12-23 23:56:04 Was talking to my 17 yo son about this... It's been a long time since the federal govt broke up Standard Oil but i think we will eventually see something similar with FB/Google. With officials at every level of govt and emergency services on these platforms not just social anymor
3408 2018-12-23 23:56:01 >>>"But it's not your life which you are gambling with ..."<<< How many lives has the US "gambled" with? Until US Plan A and Plan B failed, the SDF didn't need to negotiate with Syria. They will do well, especially with Syria's oil as a bargaining chip.
3409 2018-12-23 23:55:53 Now back to what I was doing before the TwatWaffle almost caused me to burn myself with hot oil. Be back asap
3410 2018-12-23 23:55:40 @Oil_Guns_Merica needs to give her a pep talk
3411 2018-12-23 23:55:34 I’d love to hear a podcast/your opinions on the essential oil fad  @josh_um_clark & chuck! @SYSKPodcast tell me I’m not using them for nothing!!
3412 2018-12-23 23:55:06 Castro oil. Drink about 8 ozs  Everything will be coming out         Call your in-laws to make it worthwhile
3413 2018-12-23 23:54:57 It is still a national cake even if you have a grouse with how it is made and distributed. You found yourself where there is oil and gas but did you make it ? Why are we so covetous of these natural resources given to us by God. Is it sheer greed ?
3414 2018-12-23 23:54:53 First Step: Stop the U.S. Embargo.
Why blackmail those who want to live differently from them ?!? Colombia for Example. U.S. wants Oil but Maduro says: "Yes but with MY Price. Not Yours Alms." 

There's an alternative market called B.R.I.C.K.S.
3415 2018-12-23 23:54:35 But this is par for the course. The mainstream media are complicit in all of this. Political journalists and editors? I could do a better job holding the snake oil salesmen to account. They smugly sit there, trotting out sound bites safe in the knowledge they won't be challenged!
3416 2018-12-23 23:54:24 Used some last night for anal! Whipped coconut oil, argan oil, and shae butter. It needed reapplying for sure, but felt really great. I wonder if thickening it with xanthan gum would help it be less runny when it melts. Also, citric acid won't dissolve in oil, so adding aloe.
3417 2018-12-23 23:53:33 Let the meat do the magic!
Salt pepper garlic and lots of lemon and drizzle some olive oil in so it thickens and sticks when you dip it. Greek magic
3418 2018-12-23 23:53:24 Finally freedom is your congratulations 
3419 2018-12-23 23:52:25 Think he's shaved off some stubble (and then immersed himself in a vat of Oil of Olay!)
3420 2018-12-23 23:52:17 His oil does clean me out nicely.
3421 2018-12-23 23:52:16 Chris, listen to me. I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin... ...and Jake Muller. He's Albert Wesker's son.

3424 2018-12-23 23:51:44 Spray with olive oil, skewer and throw on a hot grill (rotate a bunch). Maybe 15-20 minutes?
3425 2018-12-23 23:51:37 It’s glossy from the oil buildup
3426 2018-12-23 23:51:35 let the iso sit in a pot of hot water, let it simmer, put your oil slick mat in the bottom, been there, the worst
3427 2018-12-23 23:51:30 One thing about olive oil or any oil for that matter: if your cat has a liver condition you aren’t aware of the oil will certainly complicate it. I think better to bring your cat to the vet. Also check for any blockage like ribbon/string/hairball also
3428 2018-12-23 23:51:27 In this universe it seems Blake and Ruby are on speaking terms, Blake and Weiss....aren't, but are Blake and Yang not togeather or friends? Did something happen after all the crazy 
3429 2018-12-23 23:51:20 You ever get out of a long day of work, lather yourself in cooking oil and pretend you are a buttered biscuit while blasting Michel Jackson? 

Genuine question.
3430 2018-12-23 23:51:18 @CarlyCrewXo that’s true, but if you own the Bugatti they mention about the oil change, $21k is pocket change!

3437 2018-12-23 23:50:26 Bought fancy body oil for myself in an effort to do this self care thing the internet taught me this year. Didn't know how much I'd need and now I am very oily and am afraid to tough anything in case I leave oil stains everywhere. But also don't want to take off, it was pricey.
3438 2018-12-23 23:50:19 Balm untuk make up yg lbh tebal kalo di gunain tiap hari it's ok si tpi saya kalo buat daily kalo buat daily oil aja ua

3440 2018-12-23 23:49:54 I don’t understand this thing w oil/check engine lights. Is it a joke or y’all really don’t know how to do basic car care or take it to someone?
3441 2018-12-23 23:49:48 Predictions for Artrage 6: 
- Brush script recordings can be sent to a robotic hand that’ll paint your creations in real life 
- Capsicum brush 
- Advanced realism e.g. your tablet will begin to smell of oil paint, and you can accidentally knock over the glass of water.

3454 2018-12-23 23:48:23 okay, but why is the sesame oil on the “oriental” isle cheaper than the nonsense on the oil & vinegar isle?

3462 2018-12-23 23:47:09 Lithium is not scarce at all. Most of it is mined from brine in a salt desert where nothing can live anyway. It can also be mined from sea water (leaving behind fresh water) or even mined from the waste of oil sands.
3463 2018-12-23 23:47:05 Old man ... classic , pot calling the kettle black ... GT badddd , we got Oil ... lol stuff Venezuela..!!!
3464 2018-12-23 23:46:53 They knew. Just didn't want to get involved. No oil.
3465 2018-12-23 23:46:41 Waiting for an oil change and honestly I just keep peeking at the bar next door trying to convince myself I technically don't need to go there.

3469 2018-12-23 23:45:50 If they do, they've reasons not to say. Maybe even good reasons. The question is, do they have a plan to smooth the transition or will it be chaos worse than the 70s oil crunch.
3470 2018-12-23 23:45:49  more water? Nah need some damn baby oil & KY make dat shit look like somethin

3473 2018-12-23 23:44:58 Yes it is a oil town. Took me a few minutes waiting on the train tracks near town to figure out all the rhythmic noise was coming from the pumps and a train was not coming.
3474 2018-12-23 23:44:41 @SouthieJack heard your cannabis podcast today. Thanks for raising awareness. We use CBD to make a topical pain cream w/emu oil, & essential oils that help pain.  CBD orally stops my bros restless legs. May help cancer, needs SERIOUS medical studies. Now!!!
3475 2018-12-23 23:44:38 Not true..
The real cause is Global Warming 
Words Matter ~ Don't get the gender wrong
3476 2018-12-23 23:44:38 I think what you're missing, is that it's not and CAN'T be about how it was 'sold'. The law is the law. It's either right or wrong. You either comply, or you don't. Snake oil shouldn't come into it. Draft appropriate legislation, and snake oil ceases to exist.
3477 2018-12-23 23:44:20 You're a disgrace, a corrupt spin doctor. Every day you're in office is an insult to Australia.

#renewables are the only way power prices will drop, the fuel is free and they're now cheaper overall than #coal, oil and gas. But when you open your deluded mouth you lie about this.
3478 2018-12-23 23:44:09 use baby oil or vaseline,, that’s what i had to use when i pooped after i ripped my ass
3479 2018-12-23 23:44:07 There are different grades of oil used for different purposes. The oil we export is not the same as oil we import. Much of the oil we import is “heavy”, while mostly all, if not all, of the oil we export is “light”. Pretty simple.
3480 2018-12-23 23:44:02 When you underestimate edibles and food infused with oil, it will take you there believe me
3481 2018-12-23 23:43:57 Opiates.... As a nation we are self reliant when it comes to oil.
3482 2018-12-23 23:43:55 FYI, the Canadian reliance on Saudi/foreign oil imports for Eastern Canada predates the Saudi reliance on Canadian LAVs by more than 30 years.
3483 2018-12-23 23:43:50 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
3484 2018-12-23 23:43:46 Ponds cream and argan oil. Dassit dasall 
3485 2018-12-23 23:43:46 “Big Data isn’t the new oil, it’s the new uranium”
3486 2018-12-23 23:43:32 It is possible to have oil stopped by the end of 2019. But it means a real social revolution.  
Real violence.
Real results. 
At some point in the future when climate impacts hit harder, this will likely happen.
3487 2018-12-23 23:43:24 If climate alarmist really believe we are in danger of catastrophic climate change, stop driving your car, using electricity, heating water, cooking your food, eating meat, flying in planes,  using computers made from plastic/ oil because YOU are the problem, Apparently
3488 2018-12-23 23:43:09 This VEGAN Oil Down! 
3489 2018-12-23 23:42:46 That manning statue out front of Lucas oil says otherwise.
3490 2018-12-23 23:42:45 You will play football and sign for Dembare and be sold for a box of cooking oil  nah, itai zvemabook team yangu
3491 2018-12-23 23:42:37 Starchy ones are ok for cooking in stews and stuff. Young ones are great in salads. I just steam them for a couple of minutes and have Olive oil or butter and salt and pepper on them. The only real draw back is getting the skins off which is  a bit time consuming
3492 2018-12-23 23:42:20 Oil change for his hair?
3493 2018-12-23 23:42:10 Oil

3496 2018-12-23 23:41:47 Somebody get my oil changed for Christmas. That’s all I want.
3497 2018-12-23 23:41:38 The sad news is... at this rate... our oil and gas reserves will still be in the ground!
3498 2018-12-23 23:41:31 I don't doubt that true olive oil has some healthful properties to it. What I doubt is that 20,000 years ago & Buffalo hunt was successful that  someone in the tribe was foraging a bunch of plant matter & extracting oil from olives to make a nice salad dressing. #history #keto
3499 2018-12-23 23:41:18 anything with tea tree oil in it

3504 2018-12-23 23:40:54 Yeah, we’re irrelevant until there is an oil crisis,war, human suffering, or American planes that have nowhere to land during a crisis...
3505 2018-12-23 23:40:52 Haritu RR kata harga patut turun 10 sen jadi rm2.10. Tapi tak turun2 , walaupun harga crude oil dah cecah 50usd. Boleh ajar kira2 lagi tak berapa subsidi sekarang?

3512 2018-12-23 23:39:44 I wonder what people are pissed off about. The oil prices are a direct result of what has been happening in the industry. Our provincial and federal governments do not control the price of oil. Maybe pissed off they never embraced a view of the future.
3513 2018-12-23 23:39:39 จะคัมแล้วหรอลูกกกก
3514 2018-12-23 23:39:27 The gdp ties in to the record # of imports and lowest # of exports since 1940. 
Lets not forget how 44 killed Venezuela while handing the majority of oil sales to SA. Granted Ven is a socialist country. They made a huge mistake by making oil their only major export.
3515 2018-12-23 23:39:03 Beto is in bed with both oil and gas and AIPAC. He’s no progressive

3522 2018-12-23 23:37:44 You're kidding, right? Anyone with half a brain would have seen through this worthless, creepy snake oil salesman long ago. At the GOP debates, Trump made Ben Carson look half-way intelligent.
3523 2018-12-23 23:37:31 Sauté shallots or onions and lots of garlic in a little olive oil. Add 1 cup beef stock. I like Penzeys, 1 cup of good white wine,  a little squeeze of tomato purée and reduce by half or more.
3524 2018-12-23 23:37:26 You all know I’ve been really struggling lately. I finished my Christmas gifts, all my shopping, and I think I’m ready for Christmas. Tonight I took a nice bath with some candles, rose oil, camomile tea, and meditated. I feel 100x better.
3525 2018-12-23 23:37:20 you know you are getting old when all you ask for for christmas is an oil change

3528 2018-12-23 23:35:45 You are a liar and hypocrite.  You & your lying boss @Justintrudeau give permission to empty Quebec cr@p into St. Lawrence as if it's French-Can. toilet & holier-than-thou Victoria pretends 2 protecting water from oil tankers, flushes it's toilets into ocean when it wants
3529 2018-12-23 23:35:43 See you, until you win she will not rest. Mummy will be praying and laying hands on you, thereafter kiss you with a beautiful smile. Your "oil" have just started. "Mama di mama"
3530 2018-12-23 23:35:32 We be out here huffing olbas oil

3534 2018-12-23 23:34:52 I always had a good supply of this stuff by my side when burning the midnight oil typing bits and pieces for my fanzines 
3535 2018-12-23 23:34:44 To stop America from pumping their own oil pumps!  So they would need to rely on a 7th Century cult that worships a you know what?
3536 2018-12-23 23:34:30 Took down my braids tonight and it was the easiest I have been able to achieve ever. 

I sprayed my hair with warm water and applied oil all over. This made my hair soft and manageable.
3537 2018-12-23 23:34:26 Because guns makes the streets smell like piss. You'd think the surplus of guns would make the streets smell of gun oil. Do you know how many homeless are in NYC?
3538 2018-12-23 23:34:10 My mom comes in from church and looks at herself talkin about “ugh my face is so oily” and she starts wiping and then she gasps & stops wiping and goes “it’s the oil the pastor put on my forehead”  lmaooooooo
3539 2018-12-23 23:33:54 Ameeennn
3540 2018-12-23 23:33:51 I think I seen Doris at Dollhouse in The Cross back in ‘95, the things she could do with a shower curtain and a bottle of baby oil 
3541 2018-12-23 23:33:38 JT doesn’t mention that people all around Canada are “disturbed by the detention” of Canadian oil,  because of his hostile Western Canada bias and appeasement of foreign funded eco-activist groups. Let’s face it, he just wasn’t ready!
3542 2018-12-23 23:33:34 There seems to be no problem risking American lives for oil. With the technology the army has there's probably a bigger risk of injury on an American freeway. How many have been lost in Syria to date?
3543 2018-12-23 23:33:28 i just got into a really heated argument with my dad over olive oil
3544 2018-12-23 23:33:25 when they are payed more than oil & gas Co. pay them.
3545 2018-12-23 23:33:22 I used to say the Colts should move Luck and roll with Jacoby and use the extra funds and picks to build a solid team, Niners should do the same and move Jimmy G and let Nick Mullens sling the oil for the low low and build
3546 2018-12-23 23:32:53 No you just don’t seem to know that at the end of most years the stock market drops but if course when you have a Federal Reserve upping rates is not helping at all . By May oil will go up at least Thirty dollars a barrel along with the economy
3547 2018-12-23 23:32:52 wait2 lang kami diri nga side. pa oil change na dayon
3548 2018-12-23 23:32:51 So dabbled with some CBD oil..... where has this been all my life?
3549 2018-12-23 23:32:45 Why are people only worried about impact of low oil prices on Govt Budget?It is very small...

The real worry of low oil prices is the impact on biz sector,ringgit,commodity prices etc

Govt can borrow the few billion revenue loss BUT biz and household cannot.

Open your otak
3550 2018-12-23 23:32:36 Yes! That's the one. It tasted fine with the tomato paste but the amount of oil it asked for seemed excessive so I halved it and the consistency was more like pasta sauce.
3551 2018-12-23 23:32:35 لان المواد الكيماوية الى تنحط في شامبوا الى يقتل القمل يسبب تهيج للبشرة و ممكن يسبب تساقط للشعر و اصلان بعد فترة شهر ممكن ترجع العدوى و يرجع القمل

3552 2018-12-23 23:32:21 Probably smells like motor oil
3553 2018-12-23 23:32:14 What about those journalists arrested and held without trial for exposing Turkish security services selling oil to ISIS?
3554 2018-12-23 23:31:59 Can we trust anyone who doesn't understand direct and indirect?

For instance, the ability to drive oil prices below $20 barrel by opening up the Texas taps has OPEC over a barrel. This indirect pressure forces ME countries to stop using their funny money to sponsor terror.
3555 2018-12-23 23:31:58 Al those gold coins and grandma’s  old European oil painting will be of good use in January .
3556 2018-12-23 23:31:52 Nah, the real reason for invading Iraq was Israel, not oil.
3557 2018-12-23 23:31:38 Anyone in Ireland wanting to join Hempworx CBD oil?
3558 2018-12-23 23:31:23 Checking oil prevents engine damage.
3559 2018-12-23 23:31:16 Lamar's gone. Hopefully for good. Unless he ends up an oil lobbyist for the Heritage Foundation, or oil legislative lobbyist for ALEC.
3560 2018-12-23 23:31:13 And what's more he's not in charge. He courts arms/oil/finance corporations openly, he has the GOP establishment around him, and looks a lot like he's beholden to Russia with the anti NATO stance, the unilateral withdrawal from Syria etc. It's the same machine but more volatile.

My hubby says not you, I think it is. Sounds like you, looks like you. If not you have a “doppelgänger” please settle our disputeIs ad online?
3566 2018-12-23 23:30:15 @SYSKPodcast you should do an episode on how coconut oil works.
3567 2018-12-23 23:30:09 and $100 billion ( according to most sources) for the money owed to them for the sale of their oil to world markets and that cash was frzoen under sanctions
3568 2018-12-23 23:30:04 I'm sorry, I already died from net neutralality. I can't hear you.
3569 2018-12-23 23:29:57 Tell the people that if you pull the Troops out of Syria & China & Russia can purchase their own oil that the American dollar will loose its value. You already caused the Stock Market to bottom out. You are intentionally weakening the Dollar for Putin & Saudi Arabia.
3570 2018-12-23 23:29:46 What’s that glistening? 

Oh, just my ‘Vybranium’ Beard Oil from @VelvetNoirBC

3574 2018-12-23 23:29:12 Not really. In future Christmases you may not be able to afford petrol. Pound collapse against the dollar, lose your job and Trump induced chaos in middle east restricting oil production forcing prices up.

Merry Christmas 
3575 2018-12-23 23:29:03 Oil, always the oil, Syrian war is a land grab for pipelines into, and the benefit of others. Let them maintain and defend it, with their human capital.
3576 2018-12-23 23:28:54 Umm, the US is already "oil independent",  and exporting crude.  everything we like about living in alberta would become a lot worse as part of the US.
3577 2018-12-23 23:28:46 i use a macadmeia oil conditioner so the smell doesn’t come thru at all
3578 2018-12-23 23:28:42 Gas prices in Bowling Green today,    $1.89 - $1.98

3579 2018-12-23 23:28:40 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 5 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

3581 2018-12-23 23:28:15 God I remember the time I wanted to get into oil painting and went to buy turpentine but someone had busted a small bottle of it and when I picked it up, it got on my hand. Remembering what I read about it being toxic, I panicked and raced to the bathroom.
3582 2018-12-23 23:28:11 Venezuela has the reserves  changes in energy policy by Chavez and onward.....has taken oil as the primary target for social change.
2nd largest gas reserves after US.....but because of gov, though the world accepts it's oil, few want to invest or help in infrastructure
3583 2018-12-23 23:28:06 For me it's oil, oil is huge turn off

3587 2018-12-23 23:27:49 for my dad’s christmas present i’m just gonna check the oil in my car
3588 2018-12-23 23:27:22 Hey @CadburyUK, there are so many other options besides dirty palm oil! Choose substainable or a different kind of oil.
3589 2018-12-23 23:27:16 Snake oil salesmen  wishing you well likewise, yung jedi
3590 2018-12-23 23:27:12 There are many places In the near east where oil burns above ground . It’s hardly likely humans have ever been away from fire in our whole history . Whether natural fires or whatever else
3591 2018-12-23 23:26:55 I've ate so much oil paint and painted in a room with no window for years, is this why I'm stupid?
3592 2018-12-23 23:26:51 don't know much about Christmas but i'm pretty sure the kids today get oil from fracking instead of coal
3593 2018-12-23 23:26:42 @talkRADIO Just my opinion, but this is a big load of total snake oil.
3594 2018-12-23 23:26:41 Vaca muerta es un recurso natural que con el oil en  u$45 se complica por el momento. igual es como que me digas que impulsó el campo que no dejan de ser recursos ajenos a los gobiernos de turno  sin ellos hoy seríamos Haití
3595 2018-12-23 23:26:39 Oh PragerU is a legit propaganda channel for... Oil, I think? So they want people to vote for Trump since he's good for Oil
3596 2018-12-23 23:26:24 Shoulda told her you actually made your own cannabutter with coconut oil!
3597 2018-12-23 23:26:23 The original coating was getting very poor so I recently scrubbed it clean with soap and water and a steel cloth, covered it in oil and let it bake for an hour. It's so much better now. Better than it's ever been!
3598 2018-12-23 23:25:55 So cheap! Garbanzo beans, olive oil, lemon and lots of garlic. Really good. And cheap.

3604 2018-12-23 23:25:20 People that aren’t straight edge are always concerned with other people’s edge. CBD oil is sick it helps me out with nausea and panic attacks. Like I don’t use it to get fucked up I use it to make my daily life better. No different than taking over the counter medicine.

3609 2018-12-23 23:24:00 Most of what he says are lies, so hows is one to know what's a promise and what's a lie. Like I thought Mexico paying for wall was a promise, but now it seems American tax payers will pay. I assumed helping middle class was a promise, now seems like a tax cut for big business.

3614 2018-12-23 23:23:13 You think he shaves against the grain? Probably some tea tree oil to condition?
3615 2018-12-23 23:22:45 He knew exactly how to tap into, and exacerbate their fears.
He's a snake oil salesman.
3616 2018-12-23 23:22:42 It's not about the oil; it was never about the oil. The oil is a distraction. It's about a different way of life and a different kind of politics and governance.

3619 2018-12-23 23:21:54 Definitely has some effect. I tried 350 mg oil. It wasn't enough for me. Need to try stronger but haven't been able to afford yet. Have been trying to make my own FECO oil from medical mj. That does help some too. Lots of experimentation needed to find right dose. Best  to her!
3620 2018-12-23 23:21:36 Bar shege
3621 2018-12-23 23:21:20 ? 
The current reaction is bc the world economy is really bad. 
look at oil, there is no demand. 
The stock market is not the real economy, most trades are now done by Algorithmic trading machines, not ppl.
3622 2018-12-23 23:21:18 I want to go out in the sun lathered in oil/cocoa butter to take one of those melanin pics and look rel sweet but i go roastttt.

3656 2018-12-23 23:17:23 David doesn’t understand that someone from Texas will take more money from employees of oil & gas companies than candidates in other states. Just like Democrats in CA will get contributions from people in the entertainment industry. It’s common sense actually.

The money John A. received in the Pacific Scandal came from US sources. For Albertan neocons, taking US bribes isn't corruption; it's a career. #abpoli #ableg
3661 2018-12-23 23:16:33 Oil Borb
3662 2018-12-23 23:16:28 ...and arguably misleading tweets about O'Rourke taking money from "the oil and gas industry" when the figure includes _employees_ of that industry and Texas residents comprise 39% of that industry's American jobs.  It's not a principled critique, it's spreading FUD.
3663 2018-12-23 23:16:25 @FBI @Comey @handsfactor  Have you noticed how Putin has allied with all the most corrupt in the oil/steel/iron/aluminum businesses to create divisions,  strong polarization, hatred around the world? You have to stop  Putin and his lackeys. Trump among them.
3664 2018-12-23 23:16:20 ICONS. Fuck, ANY superhero game I own. Superhero movies make more money than oil and heroin, but no one wants to play a supers rpg.
3665 2018-12-23 23:16:18 Qbout time, no more false flag and Russia can deal with that threat, remember tyo Turkish oil convoys, were Eliminated.
3666 2018-12-23 23:16:00 @ASavageNation have you tried Doggy CBD oil or CBD isolate? I would try mixing it in a sweet Greek yogurt with probiotics & giving him at least 10 MGs of CBD per day. It’ll 100% help in one way or another.
3667 2018-12-23 23:15:58 Why is gasoline in California $2 more a gallon than the rest of the country? Oil is below $50, and no change in price.
3668 2018-12-23 23:15:50 and Snake Oil Sturgeon trying to stir up the pot hasn't earn't her the greatest deal of respect while it threatens the whole country either.

"Several years ago, Wendy's switched to a vegetable cooking oil that contains 0 grams of trans fats."
3671 2018-12-23 23:15:14 Guess I'm gonna fix an oil leak for ma instead of getting dusted
3672 2018-12-23 23:15:10 Jerusalem is imptnt to all Abrahamic religions. But that narrative is just a globalist facade. The truth is that  is a geographically and militarily strategic nation for Western countries. Access to big oil. It’s the largest USA military base in the region. Globalist agenda
3673 2018-12-23 23:14:58 Ororo no be crude oil
3674 2018-12-23 23:14:52 Can't decide whether to watch The Princess Switch, Bird Box, or to fall asleep with a book on my chest and my diffuser misting 'tranquility' scented essential oil. Decisions, decisions...(recommendations/opinions welcome!)
3675 2018-12-23 23:14:49 To late Steve the incompetence in the WH and this administration will cost investors big time in 2019 !!

PS — you are just another GOP snake oil salesman !!
3676 2018-12-23 23:14:41 Think I wanna do a hot oil treatment
3677 2018-12-23 23:14:27 Oil up
3678 2018-12-23 23:14:14 All lanes now open on the #M1 northbound between J8 #A414 #HemelHempstead and J9, traffic collision, debris and oil spillage have all been cleared. No delays.
3679 2018-12-23 23:14:11 Now that is really interesting. Though not sure if that's the full fluoride dose of adult toothpaste. But it proves you don't need palm oil to put it in. Because SLS is what contains the palm oil in toothpaste (and some other ingredients too.)
3680 2018-12-23 23:13:54 Turkey is siding with isis and favor getting rid of Kurds in Iraq as kurds have oil. When will turkey become a secular state honoring all religions
3681 2018-12-23 23:13:50 Yeah via Turkey. We all saw Russian Military release the evidence of ISIS oil trucks entering turkey via middle men. Most of the oil went to other jihadis in Idlib and in return ISIS regions got more money. All part of the ISIS-Idlib oil trade that was stopped by Russia.

3684 2018-12-23 23:13:29 So that’s how Cybermen do an oil change!
3685 2018-12-23 23:13:27 you... don’t oil it??
3686 2018-12-23 23:13:16 Exxon oil ships were in Venezuelan maritime territory, violating sovereignty and of course pretending to explore and produce petroleum from Venezuelan grounds...
3687 2018-12-23 23:13:12 Problem with those RedNeck Albertians, they could be pumping out 100 times what they are now, but without buyers, the oil goes nowhere, so get buyers then make demands for delivery
3688 2018-12-23 23:13:08 Coming from an opportunist like Paula, who took a duly elected Senator's seat then promptly voted for an anti Oil bill, we should listen up!
3689 2018-12-23 23:13:00 I’m sure anyone who reads this re-hashed dirge will realise in a few years that they have been had by a snake oil salesman. The man who knew too little but thought he knew everything @matthewsyed
3690 2018-12-23 23:12:57 I only recall the closing of monuments, which made even less sense.
3691 2018-12-23 23:12:57 The problem with social democracy is that those egalitarian welfare states are built on a global imperialist system. Norway’s oil is destroying the planet, Germany’s banks are ravaging Greece, Switzerland’s benefits come from a banking system drowning in blood money, etc.
3692 2018-12-23 23:12:47 Yeaaaah I don’t think anointing oil will fix a broken leg...so I’ll pass on the lecture thanks
3693 2018-12-23 23:12:46 I can’t find my golden rod colored oil pastel 
3694 2018-12-23 23:12:40 Right now, I'm using the bliss clay cleanser, it cosmetics confidence in a cream, Paula's choice skin perfecting liquid, all in that order. No9 oil cleanser to remove make-up, followed with the usual routine.
3695 2018-12-23 23:12:32 This is a note for @JustinTrudeau... yes oil out of AB has no value... waaa... that’s the cost of putting an entire provinces value into only 1 asset. Here’s a radical idea... let’s build the gas plants needed HERE so we are independent of  for gas since we make so much oil
3696 2018-12-23 23:12:27 Mmm, scooter snuff video! Where did I put that @JoeyRyanOnline oil....
3697 2018-12-23 23:12:08 Have oil & gas industries claimed they knew climate change would be a result of their actions like big tobacco admitted that they knew smoking could cause cancer? Was there an acceptable reason to use cigarettes like hunting for gun owners? What oil and gas have done is heinous/
3698 2018-12-23 23:12:00 本人と職場が離れていると、確認するのも難しいですね。管理職は本当に大変だと思います。
3699 2018-12-23 23:11:55 Trump never betrayed any ally.  He just asked them to pay their fair share.  Also, I don't believe the the Middle East is going to blow up and even needs a US intervention. Oil is everywhere so to hell with terrorist Saudi Arabia.  Let those folks workout their own problems.
3700 2018-12-23 23:11:51 @TeaPainUSA Logging and drilling for oil in national parks, cheating on my taxes. No one is trying to stop me. #trumpshutdown
3701 2018-12-23 23:11:31 Where are the Saint John protestors where all the Saudi oil is coming in....Norman Same place 32 of 32 Atlantic Canada MP riding went Liberal, you see the Atlantic Canada did not like Harper telling them the truth so now they have no Energy East but love the Equalization money.
3702 2018-12-23 23:11:29 Do you avoid any other oils for the environmental impact? I'm thinking of chipping away at them one by one starting with corn oil being the least effecient.
3703 2018-12-23 23:11:24 I know.....I saw it.

Satan's loose and CNN os his spokesman.
3704 2018-12-23 23:11:23 @SenFeinstein Why is gasoline $2 more a gallon in California than the rest of the country? Oil is below $50, but no change in price.
3705 2018-12-23 23:11:21 If you wanna get me something for Christmas I’ll take oil for my motorcycle and a new clutch thank you 
3706 2018-12-23 23:11:20 I got a cool new hat thanks lucas oil
3707 2018-12-23 23:11:20 Just like Unifor bailed on the oil & gas industry in Alberta. I have sympathy for your members who are losing their jobs, but none for Unifor. What hoes around comes around
3708 2018-12-23 23:11:16 maybe if you set up your own servers in an abandoned offshore oil rig somewhere
3709 2018-12-23 23:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: soggy crust with sad motor oil and cheese.
3710 2018-12-23 23:10:47 ||True, but when you think about how basically anything mass-fried is fried in corn oil and how ethanol is mad out of corn and if you’re old enough, alcohol? We learned a lot about corn in school.

3716 2018-12-23 23:10:22 some girl was looking at my aftercare selection and looks at emu oil and goes “what in the heck is emo oil?” to which i replied “my tears”
3717 2018-12-23 23:10:19 I accidentally spilled some beard oil on the countertop and now it’s wearing a bow tie, drinking a Pabst Blue Ribbon and listening to some band only two people have ever heard of.
3718 2018-12-23 23:10:11 Nothing like having defense industry exec as Secretary of Defense.  An idiot in Education, oil man in Energy (also an idiot), environmental raper in Interior, anti-vaccine Dr in Health, and other totally unfit and useless cabinet secretaries coveting special interest groups.

3724 2018-12-23 23:09:45 Petroleum jelly, olive oil or mineral oil.
3725 2018-12-23 23:09:26 As long as we can keep selling arns and access cheap oil.
3726 2018-12-23 23:09:20 Not many moving parts left, probably doesn't need much oil.
3727 2018-12-23 23:09:17 Listen, if you get me an essential oil diffuser for Christmas, you're getting punched in the face. #GiftGivingGuide
3728 2018-12-23 23:09:14 My mom and dad paid for my oil change yesterday and I thought I could cry. They are seriously the best. 
3729 2018-12-23 23:09:08 Lead us to salvation pour that oil please
3730 2018-12-23 23:08:59 Make mint sauce: In a small bowl, combine vinegar, mustard, and honey. Whisk in oil and mint. Season with salt and pepper; set aside. If making ahead, cover and refrigerate up to 1 day. Before serving, bring to room temperature, and whisk.
3731 2018-12-23 23:08:56 Is  ex chancellor (CDU Party) of #Germany Gerhard Schoeder (chairman of Rossneft the Russian state controlled oil company) the driving force for German pro-Putin Russian support?
Also instrumental in leading attacks against Ukraine with aim to undermine support for Ukraine.

3736 2018-12-23 23:08:03 That granddaddy purp sounds good.  another bunch of CBD flavored oil added to mine won’t hurt anything, and thanks for the clarification.  Fields of hemp is another site.  Never bought from them,  but tweedle had some AC/DC that was theirs that I grabbed,  good tasty and aromatic
3737 2018-12-23 23:08:02 The articles have been attacks on him because he gets money from oil & gas industry employees of Texas, the states largest employer.

What's he supposed to do? NOT take money from the people of Texas?
3738 2018-12-23 23:07:34 Don't spoil it all by being nice and caring. Surely we can sell them life rafts or life jackets or tents or something.  FFS they have oil and theyre  not even white. Surely somebody like you can negotiate a deal for America out of this.

3741 2018-12-23 23:07:14 Not sequestration.  Just a change from the 33% old fashioned low temperature burning to the 50% or more efficient process.  But I actually want to get rid of coal and gas and oil burning, solar and wind won't do it this century if ever.  But nuclear can.  11pm here and goodnight.
3742 2018-12-23 23:07:13 In fairness, authorities are unsure of a motive.
3743 2018-12-23 23:07:07 I'mma tell you what is a good moisturizer that can double as a leave-in and is cheap---African pride "Olive Miracle---Anti-breakage formula" Leave-in conditioner. That stuff is so good and is under $3 at Wal-Mart. I love it since I'm on a budget. I apply oil or hair grease next.
3744 2018-12-23 23:07:04 Try lavender oil on your pillow case! Either it'll work, or your pillow will smell awesome.
3745 2018-12-23 23:07:02 No. Bless .I really don't do girlie songs.
3746 2018-12-23 23:06:47 That and we’re all dead already
3747 2018-12-23 23:06:31 We? What do you mean “we”. The globalist oil investors and bankers are still butt hurt over not being able to ravage Russia’s resources and control their economy.  Looking at Ukraine I see it’s still a neocons wet dream.
3748 2018-12-23 23:06:30 me desperately trying to distract myself from my troubles by turning to twitter is like throwing oil over a fire omg im rlly a dumb bitch
3749 2018-12-23 23:06:30 has olive oil always been so expensive??
3750 2018-12-23 23:06:25 Im literally going to throw your father into a vat of hot oil
3751 2018-12-23 23:06:05 Hey can you do some side word for me?? Looking to get brakes and ball joints fixed up, and maybe the oil pan...  HMU
3752 2018-12-23 23:05:53 Wow, it's really over for oil. I mean, it's a matter of months. Serious question: Does any major #canpoli politician realize what's unfolding?
3753 2018-12-23 23:05:53 "@BetoORourke backed off supporting #MedicareForAll, aligned with the party’s #WallStreet faction, voted to gut financial regulations, supported #GOP-crafted #TaxCuts, boosted the #FossilFuel industry – and then broke his own pledge to reject donations from #oil & #gas execs."

3762 2018-12-23 23:04:28 How is climate change his fault? We are the only country that has reduced our carbon levels. All those other countries that signed that thing up. Oil fracking!
3763 2018-12-23 23:04:18 Great, clear it up for us.  Is it, A) Canadian oil companies are carbon taxed out of the market against competitors from non-ctax jurisdictions? Or B) Oil companies don't pay ctax (because there's an election coming)? Can't have it both ways.
3764 2018-12-23 23:04:13 BTW, lap dogs are an oil and gas industry thing. It always has Scooby snacks available to give out to good lil public servants who do its bidding. #copolitics #coleg @ColoradoRising

3776 2018-12-23 23:02:31 Very random thought, but I need to take it back to the basics and start doing hot oil treatments on a regular basis. I need to start using my hair steamer too. I just hate having to find ways to prop it up so I can sit under it. 
3777 2018-12-23 23:02:15 Daily bubble baths with baby oil & epsom salt added keeps my skin so soft and mosturized !
3778 2018-12-23 23:02:09 1- never use normal soap
2- Neutrogena or Clean and Clear OIL FREE face wash (They're expensive but they last for several months)
3- never use face moisturizers
3779 2018-12-23 23:02:06 JT sent two ministers to send a funding message to the oil industry that both could not even get behind themselves. Have you ever seen such a flat, apathetic, emotionless delivery. Sohi stared at the ground the entire time. He knew it was smoke & mirrors!

3795 2018-12-23 23:00:03 Odds for an effective Euro Army slim and none. Cutting Putin’s income by Euros not using his oil and gas different story.  NATO remains viable...Russia not USSR!
3796 2018-12-23 23:00:00 Next put pots of hot oil and rock throwers on top
3797 2018-12-23 22:59:59 #UKOG DL said oil tankers at HH don't matter..

Really! Oh yes they do DL

Yea lots of tests agreed .

But don't tell me tankers don't matter just coz right know you're rapped up with Brockham mate !
3798 2018-12-23 22:59:58 Clearly a design for self policing and the population control of a desert dwelling culture due to a lack of resources. After all if it weren't for oil they would still be killing each other over mudholes, their mentality is obsolete but now they are being used as weapons !

3808 2018-12-23 22:58:12 I stopped doing side work completely when a "friend" stiffed me after doing-brakes, ball joints, and oil pan on his F250. I spent countless hours after work in the garage/shop. My income at the dealer has gone up 40k plus after that.
3809 2018-12-23 22:58:05 I agree .... but it’s not about oil anymore

3820 2018-12-23 22:56:20 If you’re buying full gram cartridges for less then $35 a piece, you’re smoking coconut oil haha.
3821 2018-12-23 22:55:52 They've gotta choose whomever they can to reduce natural gas prices, just as we continue to import oil from unfriendly nations in the Middle East, when we have the option to import *only* from allies.
3822 2018-12-23 22:55:46 It may not come as a surprise, but there is a metric shit ton of racists in the oil industry.
3823 2018-12-23 22:55:44 Smuggling guns into the USA?  Sounds a lot like smuggling oil into Saudi Arabia.

The current pre-market quote:
45.82/45.24
3827 2018-12-23 22:55:19 Not all heavy oil is acquired by surface mining. Majority of deposits are too deep for that. All you will see on the surface is standard wellsite.
In contrast to massive deposits of oil, lithium is scarce and way more expensive to cover transportation needs.

いや、元々正社員が解雇できないと言うことに端を発して、有期雇用の今の惨状があるのだが……
3831 2018-12-23 22:55:07 I just had a memory from 2016. Bernie was attacked on just this issue. His contributions from “Big Oil” were actually a large percentage. Turns out it was workers in the oil industry. This was a strength, said the Bernies. For Beto, no!
3832 2018-12-23 22:55:06 ダブルおめでした
3833 2018-12-23 22:55:04 I found some reed diffuser oil that isn’t a gross artificial pine smell but rather that nice subtle smell that live trees kind of give off. It’s not the same by any means but it helps :)
3834 2018-12-23 22:55:02 so not only did my cartridge break and my precious oil leak out, but the bottom broke off into my pen & now i have to get a new one. my life is a jokkkkeee

3836 2018-12-23 22:54:50 Thank you. Coming from someone that lives in the middle of the oil patch. I've been arguing with some of those dolts before about this and they are worse than Trumpers in the lack of comprehension department.

3844 2018-12-23 22:53:49 My recipe for hummus: 
1 can garbanzo or chickpeas. Save liquid, use as needed.
1 large lemon
1 clove of garlic
Tbl of roasted sesame seeds, a splash of olive oil, a pinch of salt (cuz who has tahini) 
Blitz to taste.

3845 2018-12-23 22:53:34 Imagine willingly using sunflower oil, like do you want your food to come out of the Simpsons or some shit?
3846 2018-12-23 22:53:30 yes. but I'm incredibly nervous about people trying to elevate someone who 1) just lost his high-profile race 2) is a relative policy unknown to me (but seems to have some unpleasant ties to oil & gas, and made some bad votes on consumer finance protection)
3847 2018-12-23 22:53:29 nope.

even though I hate soeharto regime

the truth is... the east timor developnments were much better (roads, schools etc)

and remember they were no oil/gas money back then.
3848 2018-12-23 22:53:26 Since all of us are saying we are broke this Christmas. I think it’s best we do joint celebration. I have vegetable oil, who will donate chicken and jollof rice ingredients

Blend.
3856 2018-12-23 22:52:30 There is probably a step in there too where we invade Mexico and steal their oil to pay for the wall.

3858 2018-12-23 22:52:29 Yes. The protein treatment was a product by my hairstylist. the coconut treatment was coconut oil and this other oil I can’t think of I put it on my hair dry and sat under the dryer for about 30-45 mins.
3859 2018-12-23 22:52:15 Do you use real authentic dick oil in yours?
3860 2018-12-23 22:52:14 Ooooor you can just not use oil paints since its a fucken hassle to clean your supplies up, not to mention that once you use it with a brush, that brush cant pick up any other type of paint.
3861 2018-12-23 22:52:04 The Right in Canada is like the Right in the US. They’re for lower taxes, pro business, pro oil, pro defense, anti-immigration, and anti social services. They want to privatize our public healthcare. Pretty much assholes in my book. Neoliberalism isn’t any better. Just shinier.
3862 2018-12-23 22:51:46 depends on who will kill the kurds first Turkey or Syria, just for a load of oil
3863 2018-12-23 22:51:45 Yes I do remember screaming when Bush send troops to Iraq, Of course bush lied about weapons of mass destruction and it happened right after 911 but we went to the wrong country, it was really over oil, Please let’s see some proof about what you’re saying, I’ll wait
3864 2018-12-23 22:51:44 Lemon Essential oil will remove it. The good kind not the crap fake kind.

3882 2018-12-23 22:49:44 also I think there is very little novel fats / industrial seed oils. There are omega 6 fats from mustard oil, almond oil etc but those are produced differently, then there are saturated fats like ghee and coconut oil and coconut milk with is ubiquitous in Northern India.

3897 2018-12-23 22:48:12 depends on your hair individually. my pores in my scalp already produce oil naturally so it needs a oil with a thin coat in order to be able to penetrate. coco nut oil is thick so it usually just sits on my scalp and builds up causing flakes.... you honestly have to test it out
3898 2018-12-23 22:48:05 Wah gwan fi di missing barrels a oil??
3899 2018-12-23 22:48:03 Your body responds to stress by producing cortisol. Which then triggers excess oil production in your skin, and this results in clogged pores and...you guessed it. Acne.

3908 2018-12-23 22:46:40 Yes I have kids, and they eat meat too. They are healthy.

And I want humanity to stop using oil and use sustainable energy only. That will stop global warming. Veganism doesn't do sh!t for reducing global warming. You make it look like GHG are just from animals,.. just dumb.

3913 2018-12-23 22:45:11 What about the oil we export that is burned?

Thats ours
3914 2018-12-23 22:45:10 Yes? oil futures and gold futures are paper assets and there is paper bitcoin on the CME

3924 2018-12-23 22:44:10 Did you feel the same way when the tobacco industry was held responsible for their practices? How about the current lawsuits against Purdue Pharma for fueling the opioid crisis? Or those against the oil and gas industry for climate change?
3925 2018-12-23 22:44:05 I guess it will depend on why prices have fallen. Lack of demand or over supply? Or one oil block trying to put another out of business? Need to do a bit of surfing.

3931 2018-12-23 22:43:31 staying in a hotel with my family and my mums bf's family and honestly? i'd rather choke on oil
3932 2018-12-23 22:43:20 Syria is oil rich, which is most likely why Russia and possibly Turkey want control. Trump is doing as he is told to do because Putin owns Trump.

Prescient. 

Getting off oil hurts Russia, because they live off oil revenues.

This explains everything re Trump: AGW denial, ANWR drilling, hamstringing solar and wind projects, ceding the Middle East. 

Makes me sick.
3936 2018-12-23 22:43:02 Shell BP and other so called gas and oil companies are also exploring and developing green alternatives to petrol and diesel such as hydrogen. The  only exhaust product of hydrogen combustion is water vapour. Maybe we shouldn’t be so judgemental.

3939 2018-12-23 22:42:50 He ran a surplus in 3 of the 10 years including the last year when oil prices dropped in half. Guided the country thru the worst recession since 1929, using deficit spending on infrastructure to help. The current government is unsuccessful meeting almost all promises made.

3945 2018-12-23 22:41:11 He did it last year and didn’t tell us so we were really confused and concerned that we’d have to pay money we didn’t have when the oil truck rolled up. This year was also a surprise because he has to replace our roof next month so we figured there wouldn’t be an oil gift haha
3946 2018-12-23 22:41:11 His plan didn't include steel slats. Also he's changed his story so many times in front of public crowds and gone back on things to be said often more so than not. He's just a charlatan selling snake oil to all of his believers who have faith in it.
3947 2018-12-23 22:41:05 i dip a qtip in baby oil and stick it up his butt to stimulate and force him to poop.
3948 2018-12-23 22:41:04 Ok, but that’s the exact point of this article! The Bernie orbit is arguing Beto is not (that) progressive because of taking NON PAC money from individuals who work in the oil industry in his state.
3949 2018-12-23 22:40:52 Any hormonal changes you’ve experienced recently? Increased stress levels? The sudden excess oil and increased breakouts sounds hormonal. If not, what changes have you made to your routine recently? Even the most minor change.

3952 2018-12-23 22:40:45 Yes. You are right. To clarify: The investigation found that the number of deaths of US oil/gas field workers almost exactly equals the number of deaths of US soldiers stationed in Afghanistan over same period of time. In both cases: between 2008-2017, 1566 dead.
3953 2018-12-23 22:40:37 think I saw my boss use olive oil as lube for the dough mixer today. I can't wait for white genocide.

3960 2018-12-23 22:39:53 Would take those attacking him for being doctrinaire more seriously if they weren't also people who bought the psuedo-handwringing "powerful people have to make difficult decisions" routine when it came to illegal oil wars.
3961 2018-12-23 22:39:52 ME has 3 neg factors that US can't solve. 1. Oil fuels &empowers a very conservative &extremist base. 2.There are 2many young men who r easily manipulated &no jobs 4them 3. Religion is very conservative. No matter what the US does thesefactors will NOT CHANGE.
3962 2018-12-23 22:39:47 This smells like the 'Oil For Food' scandal with Iraq and our so-called European allies including the UN (Kofi Anan).

And they question the dependability of the United States? 

Bribes to get the US to pass the Iranian Nuclear Deal? What did Obama & Kerry know. Were they bribed?
3963 2018-12-23 22:39:34 Donald Trump’s Bizarro World: Russia is making great gains in the Middle East. Do you think the play is for control of global oil supply, other than in N. America? Which would explain why the US is working so hard to increase its oil production.

3967 2018-12-23 22:39:06 Hemp based CBD is what I've been using. The CBD in hemp and mj is the same thing. With CBD you won't test positive in a urine drug screen because it's THC they test for and CBD oil hemp-based but I think also mj based has no THC in it. I had the same issue re: quality.
3968 2018-12-23 22:39:03 She’s against fracking, against wars for oil, supports a Green New Deal and wants us to move completely to renewables by 2030.
3969 2018-12-23 22:38:52 Wastefully burning up the oil backlog and adding CO2 needlessly to the atmosphere, all in support of getting more dirty oil out of the ground spread around the world. Fail.

3974 2018-12-23 22:37:35 It’s misleading to say he took “oil industry money.” He didn’t. He didn’t take Oil PAC money. He only accepted money from individuals. Are you suggesting there aren’t democrats and progressives who live in Texas and who work in the industry?
3975 2018-12-23 22:37:27 Do u think we can go lower in oil first?
3976 2018-12-23 22:37:11 I GOT GESSO, CANVASES, AND MORE OIL PAINTS!
3977 2018-12-23 22:36:47 Splashing water into a grease fire will only send the burning oil flying. This will not help your situation

3985 2018-12-23 22:35:34 Sorry George but if we speak truth about them we are better informed and if Debbie Wasserman Schultz didnt play Bernie we would NOT have a Trump presidency. Beto is not a saviour of nothing except oil profits.
3986 2018-12-23 22:35:34 If I didn’t know better, I’d say the Middle East Muslims have bought most European & N. American leaders with their oil & war blood money, and they are attempting the Muslimization of the West. Of course, I could just need a drink and stop worrying about the end of civilization!
3987 2018-12-23 22:35:32 I'd check my oil, hoses, & belts.
Never hurts to be safe.
3988 2018-12-23 22:35:24 Mourning the deaths of oil/gas field workers while working to make #fossilfuel extraction a thing of the past and demanding a just transition for workers. That’s love, not hate.

3991 2018-12-23 22:35:17 How did the call go? Waited you gave him the #kurds to murder over what? Oil, money weapons
3992 2018-12-23 22:35:12 I now own and use a bamboo toothbrush.

So if I'm not using the plastic wrapped, palm oil containing toothpaste I currently own, what should I use that contains enough fluoride and is "good for my teeth".

Any dentists out there with opinions on this?

3995 2018-12-23 22:35:00 They sell 호떡 mix kits in a box that's tasty. Comes with everything just gotta add water and oil or smth and cook it. If there's an Asian market near you, they prob have it. It's Beksul(?) brand by CJ foods~
3996 2018-12-23 22:34:57 I guess buying local doesn’t include Canadian oil

4001 2018-12-23 22:34:10 Yeah no that’s not what happened. His tweet was directly misleading, attempting to make it seem he was taking money from corporate oil. It was disingenuous, you can review his record and that’s fair game. But he deliberately was trying to slime Beto, it’s just a fact
4002 2018-12-23 22:34:09 How can you not understand that I’m saying that your coochie smells like olive oil you burn the sausage and it’s ruining my backyard hope you’re happy you slut
4003 2018-12-23 22:33:48 That snob attitude it’s exactly what will allow Carbon lobbies to keep winning over and over again, until the last drop of oil will be burned. Thank you for your useful job on sparing few kilos of co2 instead of finding a realistic way for the masses to cut co2 emissions for real
4004 2018-12-23 22:33:38 Oh well I figured cause they do have people who take their cars for them for oil changes and all that shit so I wouldn’t see why he isn’t gonna do that
4005 2018-12-23 22:33:38 It’s like we are the “special oil” for their happiness... SMH
4006 2018-12-23 22:33:28 Wait till all the truckers find out that driverless trucks are coming fast and in the oil sands they are already there, these people are just gullible and deserve everything they get in the future
4007 2018-12-23 22:33:25 To do what? Collect the oil?
4008 2018-12-23 22:33:18 That a value system can be so corrupt as to deem Trump a success is a testimony to American society, not to a single individual, disgusting as he might be.
4009 2018-12-23 22:32:48 Omg I’ve just tried my first pork scratching. That is the worst taste in the world. U might as well pour oil down my throat

4014 2018-12-23 22:31:29 Based on your thoughts and knowledge of world politics? I think you missed out on how much we are spending to be in the fight in Syria, and for what?  What is the US gain? They have oil, that's why we are there. Not gaining anything for US, just oil companies getting rich again.
4015 2018-12-23 22:31:20 Bernie exemplifies what a true politician  should be, someone who will not sell out his constituents for “campaign contributions”. Beto voted to deregulate Wall Street and he takes money from the oil industry. This is what wrong with some Dems you vote for party instead of record
4016 2018-12-23 22:31:13 thanks for getting in touch. General Mills is a member of and supports the principles of the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), whose efforts aim to encourage and certify sustainable palm oil production practices.

4020 2018-12-23 22:30:40 The "war" on Beto, from my perspective, has nothing to do with Bernie. Beto is too close to big oil and his voting record is a deep concern. You might be able blow that off because he's "cool" but the only issue I can't make any comprises on is climate. It's life it death.

4059 2018-12-23 22:24:15 The greatest wealth Nigeria  possesses is not the oil wells and the petroleum fields. No, the greatest wealth of Nigerian is raw untapped human resources.
4060 2018-12-23 22:24:01 You caused the BP oil spill don’t think we forgot you dunce
4061 2018-12-23 22:23:59 Omg......my bff turned me onto rosehip oil....love it!!!!
4062 2018-12-23 22:23:50 Have you every thought what goes through a cashiers mind at wall-mart? Hmm, Tootsie Rolls, jumper cables, vegetable oil, two bananas, a pannini press and a Martha Stewart cookbook. = Date Night?
4063 2018-12-23 22:23:32 Let’s remember what happened when Ken Livingstone wooed his marxist pals in Venezuela buying oil for our buses in London. That didn’t work out well. Corbyn wouldn’t know how to strike a deal. He couldn’t even negotiate his definition of anti semitism with antisemites in his party
4064 2018-12-23 22:23:23 Hedge has flipped opinion on Powell 

- while the marker had to endure pain b/c of the ridiculous run in PEs, Powell has killed 10 yr yields putting a floor in equities

Add to this a very nice sell-off in oil and perhaps a trade deal... the  can re-emerge in 2019
4065 2018-12-23 22:23:15 Oh, you mean like gutting the EPA and removing those pesky regs. So coal and other pollution heavy corps. can dump more sludge into our waters and freeing up the public lands selling them off to big oil to free up all that sequestered carbon.
4066 2018-12-23 22:23:11 With oil also at near record low prices and gasoline prices near record highs, perhaps the refineries that use so much natural gas to refine oil into gas should be paying more of their fair share!
4067 2018-12-23 22:23:07 Alberta problems are almost entirely due to the collapse of oil prices. That sucks, but the rest of the economy is enjoying reduced gas price. Even here in Doug Ford-ruled Ontario there is generally optimism, even though we've lost 1000s of manufacturing jobs.
4068 2018-12-23 22:23:06 He owns an oil company 
He is the founder of five star music 
He is the CEO of Emmy Don electronics...have clear ur questions 
               Now ask again
4069 2018-12-23 22:22:46 I’m really having some kind of allergic reaction to the oil I’m supposed to apply to my breast everyday for the next two months lmaoo I’m about to lose my mind
4070 2018-12-23 22:22:43 The colonial power of the United States and Europe's intervention in Somalia is to steal Somalia's natural resources especially oil but unable to lay foot because they will get burn by an IED explosives from the peoples resistance. 6/6
4071 2018-12-23 22:22:28 Problem is we don't even have oil
4072 2018-12-23 22:22:25 Beto was OK but that’s about it. I did hope he would beat the repulsive Ted but he didn’t. He didn’t win against Ted Cruz . And he took oil $. That’s not where we should be 
4073 2018-12-23 22:22:17 Buy local!?!?!? How about you doing everything in your power to ensure we keep buying oil from Saudi Arabia instead of our own?

Can you go a day without exposing your hypocritical agenda? No, you cant.
4074 2018-12-23 22:21:37 peppermint oil on your inflammed joints 
4075 2018-12-23 22:21:17 True that, dirty oil, not socially acceptable. Refined stable hydrocarbons only sterilize the soil, no problem. The massive content of the sewage surfactants will bind to the hydrocarbon molecules and only kill plants and animals. Good to go for drinking.
4076 2018-12-23 22:21:08 man their fight is with colombia if we're being serious they need the oil anyways

4083 2018-12-23 22:19:43 Beto has voted for Wall St banks to charge black people more money than white people, for Trump's deportation policies, for Big Oil to drill off the Gulf and increase its profits. But sure, it's all "Bernie Bros," a paid-troll talking point. You didn't get paid?! Sucker!
4084 2018-12-23 22:19:39 You guving up everthing made frim oil and gas and its byproducts?
4085 2018-12-23 22:19:31 Neither will them tackling like the running back has baby oil all over him

4087 2018-12-23 22:19:17 Tht nigga Kamara slick as oil
4088 2018-12-23 22:19:17 This might actually benefit Brazil,  as new rounds of public bids for oil extraction sites approach in 2019, reducing relative risks for institutional investors and increasing bid values. Brazilian economic authorities should pay close attention to AMLO's next steps.
4089 2018-12-23 22:19:02 I used turpentine in the past, until I changed to linseed oil to dilute the color from the brush and dishwashing soap

4091 2018-12-23 22:18:41 Coconut oil + blow drier is very good hair grease, weakish hold but not bad for medium hair. Definitely requires daily showers.
4092 2018-12-23 22:18:33 Lol.......u get oil....for up there
4093 2018-12-23 22:18:20 
4094 2018-12-23 22:18:06 Costco near where we did Thanksgiving only had 3-pound bricks of cream cheese. Had to make cheesecake to use it up.

(Dangerous discovery - they have a Nutella imitation that doesn't use ecologically disastrous palm oil, and comes in Costco-sized packages.)
4095 2018-12-23 22:18:03 i suggest anointing with oil
4096 2018-12-23 22:17:44 i wish my car didnt tell me how many miles past due i am for an oil change, its harder to ignore lmao

4100 2018-12-23 22:17:00 yeah me too the engine broke bc i forgot to get an oil change lmao im a dumbass 
4101 2018-12-23 22:16:55 But wait there’s more! The public schools children are the last unharvested natural resource like oil, wood, and minerals, but in harvested up to this point. The standardized testing industry sprung up because their lobbyists paid politicians to  demand standardized testing

4105 2018-12-23 22:16:24 I love those albums with Wilko especially the debut. Only got into them a few years back after seeing a pal play in a Dr F covers band & then the Oil City Confidential film.
4106 2018-12-23 22:16:17 she’s a god for not fearing oil splatters...

also, she needs a bib
4107 2018-12-23 22:16:04 This is the first year. Definitely you can do ornaments next year! May I suggest usind dolomite? Works well to place a drop or two of essential oil on to add fragrance to a room! I use one with eucalyptus oil next to my bed to keep sinuses open at night.
4108 2018-12-23 22:16:01 tried to soak my eyelashes off with vegetable oil and now think i’m blind
4109 2018-12-23 22:16:00 These are all wrong. The answer is to promote American interests. Sometimes that means policing, sometimes it means oil, sometimes it means defending the sea lanes.
4110 2018-12-23 22:15:57 On what planet do the Liberals support Oil and Gas in Canada? If they actually cared about the environment they would support Canadian Energy but that’s far from reality.
4111 2018-12-23 22:15:45 Kanang napigsikan kag oil and gipukpuk nimo literally ang kalaha kay sakit. Shts. Hahaha. 
4112 2018-12-23 22:15:34 They studied and understood PETM sediments in the arctic before academics got hold of samples.

They also research oil plays in the arctic and shipping lanes they expect to open up as sea ice retreats.

4117 2018-12-23 22:14:45 We're talking about different things. It's not really the fault of the left or "leftism" that conservatives don't know how to make their ideas appealing or seem necessary.

4121 2018-12-23 22:14:28 bet to begin with you have to shampoo and condition with shit that don’t got no sulphates, so do like coconut oil or argan oil infused shampoos and conditioners
4122 2018-12-23 22:13:55 You mentioned common sense and the left. Kinda like oil and water.
4123 2018-12-23 22:13:53 You forgot Big Oil Baron
4124 2018-12-23 22:13:46 Following the money isn’t good enough imo, any Texan will have too many connections to oil and gas. The bigger problem is if his genuine principles are more favorable to bad policies
4125 2018-12-23 22:13:04 i did the shaving -> sugar + lemon + coconut oil scrub -> shaving again thing and damn i'm soft
4126 2018-12-23 22:12:49 Bro I got plenty of unused beard combs I get with my beard oil. The wood ones, though so they don’t cause static  I got you.
4127 2018-12-23 22:12:42 “Over-conformity is not new to Saudi Arabia,” said the kingdom’s OPEC governor Adeeb Al Aama. “Our conformity with the previous cuts was 120 percent between January 2017 and May 2018.” #oott #crudeoil #usoil #oil
4128 2018-12-23 22:12:10 “outrage after activists reveal that beto o’rourke consistently votes in favor of big oil and receives the second most money from them” sure is a story we’re doing, isn’t it
4129 2018-12-23 22:12:01 Looking for new oil blends to diffuse?? Here are a couple yummy ones to try! 
4130 2018-12-23 22:11:58 Than make every truck driver pull over and check shipping container.  Hire more coast guard.  Seriously building a wall won't end that problem.  We spent a ton of money protecting oil field but we can't spend money to hunt and Eliminate the drug cartel.
4131 2018-12-23 22:11:51 I didn't argue it not been our major funder, but only. Even oil is only going to fund around 52.8%,also remember that it's a deficit budget.

4142 2018-12-23 22:10:37 My anxiety has always been terrible, but particularly worse over the last few months. CBD oil has helped me deal with it.
4143 2018-12-23 22:10:27 With anything else? also: do you prefer springwater, brine or sunflower oil?
4144 2018-12-23 22:10:19 リナちゃんどした？考え事か？可愛いけど無理すんなよ？(なでなで

4146 2018-12-23 22:10:03 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
4147 2018-12-23 22:09:54 It’s also worth remembering that oil companies know that climate warmed in the past when GHGs were higher. They even use the same climate models we use to predict future climate to help find where oil source sediment accumulated in the past. This is part of their business model.
4148 2018-12-23 22:09:30 Dove Unscented soap, dickinsons face products , and Vitamin E Oil.
4149 2018-12-23 22:09:11 The trick is to use oil on your locd and scalp 1st, THEN add the other products so that you dont get the ashy/white cast. Also, some leave in conditioners dont work well with other products no matter what you do.
4150 2018-12-23 22:09:03 I only get my oil changed at this one place cause the guy flirts with me the whole time. I probably pay double 
4151 2018-12-23 22:08:59 1- No one believe Alberta oil and gas worker to be anything near monsters. The only issue is the transition to a more renewable energy and in this acknowledging that oil will still be needed as plastic and many components are derivatives of oil byproduct. Transition = time.
4152 2018-12-23 22:08:50 Sana oil

4155 2018-12-23 22:08:23 Because he was a failure. Did you not see him bragging about increasing domestic oil production? The planet cannot survive another term of fossil fuel centrism.

4162 2018-12-23 22:07:30 Grocery shopping for your parents is like a scavenger hunt, except it takes 3 hours and the prize at the end is being told you got the wrong brand of toasted organic sesame oil extract
4163 2018-12-23 22:07:16 I think Beto should prove you wrong by proposing a bold green energy policy more sweeping than Green New Deal. It’d prove that the oil money doesn’t affect him and as we all know people don’t make voting choices based on economic anxiety
4164 2018-12-23 22:07:00 I haven't boiled a sprout in my entire life. And I'm nearly 50! Every year we slice them, then stir-fry them with a bit of xmas ham, chillies and a wee bit of oil. 
4165 2018-12-23 22:06:57 Or maybe they don’t have as many oil reserves as they claim

Seeing as they won’t allow anyone to verify the amount they have left

They have made a lot of golden toilets over the years

4166 2018-12-23 22:06:57 Obama regularly compared himself to Regan. His cabinet reflected his beliefs. He literally just bragged about how good his presidency was for oil companies, and complained he didn’t get enough credit for that.
4167 2018-12-23 22:06:51 But if an individual who works at an oil company donating to a candidate is "taking money from big oil", than Bernie is guilty of the same crime.
4168 2018-12-23 22:06:43 Agreed. Lev loans look bad, probably some losses in oil patch coming (some overlap there). But nothing too awful if we don’t talk ourselves into it.
4169 2018-12-23 22:06:42 This is naive nonsense.  

Lamar Smith and his family made lots of money in the oil & gas business.  Then he goes to Congress and supports that business.  He also gives climate consensus mavens a hard time.  To claim he's been "bought" by that business is absurd.

4174 2018-12-23 22:06:09 We'll ALL pay a high price if we wait for your donor-owned centrists to get to work against climate catastrophe. How many millions will die before Oil/Gas/Wall Street donors decide to let their pet politicians do  anything?
 Dems are to climate change, what the GOP is to deficits
4175 2018-12-23 22:06:00 I’m all for environmental protection but does the science not show safe transport of the oil via the pipelines? Per capita Canada could be quite wealthy with all that oil being sent out, one would think?

4183 2018-12-23 22:05:12 Saudi Arabia has volunteered to take the lead in trimming production by more than it has agreed. The world’s biggest oil exporter plans to pump 10.2 million barrels a day in January rather than the 10.3 million allotted to it in the OPEC+ agreement. #oott #usoil #oil #crudeoil
4184 2018-12-23 22:05:12 imbecility!#Malthus projections wrong,  #Brandt #ClubofRome predicting #famine 2000 wrong , #peakoil-theory ‘200$ a barrel’ oil dead; actually in 2025 USA will produce more oil than  &  combined, oil age will end as solar kicks in (like Stone Age)70% of oil unextracted!
4185 2018-12-23 22:04:48 Iran nuclear deal was horrible! It gave our rogue regime more opportunities to sell the oil and spend this money on terrorism. That’s why Obama was pleased with it. Obama was a supporter of terror in the middle east. thank you, President Trump, for your support

4191 2018-12-23 22:04:04 ... pretty much a deal breaker for a good number of progressives, nevermind being supported by 70% of the country rn. Throw in his questionable votes on oil, and I think its logical for us to be worried.
4192 2018-12-23 22:03:54 He also has the advantage of being the darling of the donors and the oil & gas industry, while Bernie only cares about "the people".
4193 2018-12-23 22:03:39 @neiltyson Watching "Cosmos" 1x12 on global warming. It's all nice and good what you say, but if the world stops using coal and oil, how is it to survive? Everyone and everything is driven by these! We are far beyond help now!
4194 2018-12-23 22:03:32 I am taller than KAI... I guess that peaches helps you grow better than curry and chili oil...
4195 2018-12-23 22:03:01 Thanks to oil and gas I will be quite warm this winter!
4196 2018-12-23 22:02:46 Your a part of the mess as well. That is a bullshit line  we all are accountable for this earth all of us. What do u do for the earth how much trash do u produce r u an oil addict I wonder. All the young kids the trash that they buy they would side with google or nike favoritetun
4197 2018-12-23 22:02:44 Still doesn’t alter the fact that there’s a glut of oil now and our oil is not the most efficient, economically speaking, to produce. 
We’d be better off leaving the sands for now and waiting until we can make us some profit instead of lining US pockets
4198 2018-12-23 22:02:41 Yes! I teach how to make customized yoni oil during my workshops. It’s amazing masha Allah.
4199 2018-12-23 22:02:38 Soybean oil is also certified halal. SBO is in a lot of packaged foods, fried foods, as well as used in food preparation. These people are smart
4200 2018-12-23 22:02:29 Thanks for doing the heavy lifting on this. Fact is, you can’t drive down a street in Beto’s home state without finding oil and gas employees. Vermont? I don’t think so.
4201 2018-12-23 22:02:29 Yes! We still do that, usually with Olbas Oil or vapour crystals in hot water.  And it’s meant to be unlucky to give a purse without a coin in it, I’m not sure why xx
4202 2018-12-23 22:02:16 If oil gets in the 30s, will there be credit blowups soon, or is there time for shale companies. I have been reading for years about neg cash flow in shale patch, but drilling keeps happening ?
4203 2018-12-23 22:02:09 Clove essential oil is in thieves oil!

4205 2018-12-23 22:01:30 Iraq, Kuwait, U.A.E. affirm Saudi’s call to extend OPEC+ deal.
 Group’s president hints that deeper cuts could be considered. OPEC cuts may end up being deeper than agreed because of planned maintenance and production snags in some member countries, Al Mazrouei said.  #oott #oil
4206 2018-12-23 22:01:27 i don't want to support a bunch of centrist friends of oil & banking, but third-party is getting us nowhere.  we need to drag the democratic party toward a green new deal from the inside.

4209 2018-12-23 22:01:20 OK, the shortbread for the millionaire bars is just about done. Olive oil cake is done. Need to put the lasagna together, make the spice cookie things (dough logs have been chilling all day). On to the caramel of the bars! Still need to do the cheesecake! Also, need to clean!
4210 2018-12-23 22:01:13 Where can I go to get my ends clipped and a hot oil treat meant ?!
4211 2018-12-23 22:00:55 You must've not read where I said  it helps offense contractors make a profit.

US imperialism, oil, and offense contractors are all why these incidents happened.

It isn't the "globhomo" movement. It's the military industrial complex.
4212 2018-12-23 22:00:52 Maybe employees of oil companies. I know plenty of good democrats that work for oil companies.
4213 2018-12-23 22:00:35 December 23, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

4217 2018-12-23 22:00:23 because I love giving my hard earned money to greedy oil barons
4218 2018-12-23 22:00:08 Hahhahahahhhahah. Yeah they're going to pick the one who votes to help oil companies and banks and is against getting them all health care over the one against oil companies and banks and is fighting to get them health care. Dream on
4219 2018-12-23 21:59:18 Do you ever use setting sprays after you powder? The urban decay all nighter spray gets rid of that powdery look and still controls my oil
4220 2018-12-23 21:59:02 Idk if I should be grossed out, find it kind of cute or go to the store for garlic infused olive oil and shallots
4221 2018-12-23 21:59:01 If you think that way, the first part of a graph is also a case for whale oil. The thing about technology is that we retire it when better options appear.
4222 2018-12-23 21:59:00 he may have been a decent man but why on the night he signed the devolution documents, did he give away 100s of mile of scottish sea on the east coast from berwick to st andrews which has over 15+ oil wells
4223 2018-12-23 21:58:56 Bullish, double bottom and rsi bottoming out at below 30. Bottom BB crossed

4225 2018-12-23 21:58:39 After d crude oil...what else?
4226 2018-12-23 21:58:24 Thanks for your response. If no oil nat gas or wood is available then one will freeze in the winter. For example hydro tripled in cost and people in Ontario who could not afford electric heat were freezing. I.e. my point" do you live near the equator?". I was serious not flip
4227 2018-12-23 21:58:12 rationalizing non-productive expenditure. In sum, the only policy in my view is and has always been regime sustenance but now w/o the cushion of oil revenues.
4228 2018-12-23 21:58:04 Sounds like natural selection. I am okay with that.
4229 2018-12-23 21:58:00 Damnnn try vitamins and black castor oil it makes hair grow. 
4230 2018-12-23 21:57:40 The pundits, consultants & think tanks won’t admit but the reason it’s good Beto voted for Wall Street and Oil & Gas is because those industries pay the think tanks, consultants and pundits.
4231 2018-12-23 21:57:37 ive Been Posted On the Couch All Damn Day Shmoking On this Cannabis~Oil Watching these Games the Whole Damn Day Done Got the Hell Away from me.

4235 2018-12-23 21:57:13 To Sarah, an oil change and lube job are the same thing as an abortion.
4236 2018-12-23 21:57:10  Thx. Doing a Goggle search you can definitely see the Cortina in its ‘blood’ (or should that be oil?) & reckon you’re right with your assumption. Shame, though, as I quite like it & certainly wouldn’t object to owning one today. 
4237 2018-12-23 21:56:53 i just realised my bed smell like “india” cause lately i’ve been used coconut oil for my skin 
4238 2018-12-23 21:56:44 You clearly dont if you think this isnt about oil and profit.
4239 2018-12-23 21:56:43 This is Sean Biggerstaff's assistant. He's too busy anointing his loins with antler oil, but he wanted me to tell you you're all fannies.
4240 2018-12-23 21:56:26 #MeanWhile: In the kitchen washing dishes, letting this oil get hot. #Thinking I have to get these two important processes out the way. One is ending completion that I AM working on now, the other is JUST about. Should I move in May or stay here for now? 

#Hm
#ThanksGod
4241 2018-12-23 21:56:23 TL:DR - Canadian oil companies face increased costs compared to competitors in non carbon-taxed jurisdictions, except in cases where Canadian companies get a free #climate pass (thus begging the question on whether it’s really reducing emissions). #cdnpoli
4242 2018-12-23 21:56:23 Ummm, he is way more hawkish than the democratic base and we have no idea of his views on say oil, tax rates, regulation, lgbt rights, immigration, and basically everything. Ideas do matter too.
4243 2018-12-23 21:56:06 Unemployment at an all time low, tax cuts for middle class, oil production has reduced fuel prices. Oh and Federal employees got paid. You don't know what the Hell you're talking about lmao!
4244 2018-12-23 21:55:55 In f/f I recommend Olive Oil and White Bread.
4245 2018-12-23 21:55:43 #Angs #Dor PV DL it's time to put up or shut up at Brockham guys. Show us the tankers and show us the oil like #Horsehill has.

4248 2018-12-23 21:55:23 Venezuela’s navy “intercepted” a ship exploring for oil on behalf of Exxon Mobil Corp in Guyanese waters over the weekend, Guyana’s foreign ministry said
4249 2018-12-23 21:55:23 It’s tuna with sesame oil and minced spring onion.
4250 2018-12-23 21:55:20 @disruptfascism 
Heard you all had an 18 wheeler Christmas parade, Drew.

I just thought our RWNJs did stupid shit (See GoFundMe page where a wall that would need congressional approval has given some Snake Oil salesman a gazillion $$$).
4251 2018-12-23 21:55:19 I like asparagus a lot better. Especially when its sauteed in coconut or extra virgin olive oil.
4252 2018-12-23 21:55:12 When are Trump's supporters going to wake up to the fact that they elected a Snake Oil Salesman as President?
4253 2018-12-23 21:55:08 At 5am my elder sis texted me na magpa salon daw kmi at 9am sa KCC GenSan. Yeheeyyy! 

Honestly, I need a haircut/hot oil, a change of nail polish, facial, microblading, etc. 

I also need a red silk/satin dress. 

Sis, ready your wallet. 
4254 2018-12-23 21:54:52 Ya girl told you her oil light was on and you said "damn that's crazy" and now her lol's under other niggaz tweets getting more & more o's by the day.

4257 2018-12-23 21:54:01 I’ve suffered for over a decade, with my earliest memory of attempted suicide is 5th grade. I’ve looked into CBD oil but it is kinda expensive, and I’m hesitant to invest money in it if I’m not sure it’ll be for me - or if I should stick to weed 
4258 2018-12-23 21:53:52 Rara iwe who cares about the midnight oil isu tinemagetsi 
4259 2018-12-23 21:53:49 Conservative radio is loud, finacially successful and cannot be silenced by shadow banning or censorship. So what if true, voice of the people. 
It's the one place left where Conservatives cannot be silenced, yet.
4260 2018-12-23 21:53:47 @bouforyou Hi. Saw your gravy cubes at the store today, but an ingredient is palm oil. Didn’t see it on the @RSPOtweets or @CheyenneMtnZoo lists of sustainable PO. I’d like to buy your gravy but am concerned about fate of orangutans. Why is the PO you use “sustainable”? Thanks!

4262 2018-12-23 21:53:40 And the Saudis get the money to buy them from Canada from the money they receive from the oil we buy from them. I don’t understand why you cannot connect the dots.
4263 2018-12-23 21:53:37 Trudeau is on the side of communism. He has been destroying Canada making everyone dependant on government. Our largest sectors auto and oil he has assisted in shutting down. He wants to be dictator!
4264 2018-12-23 21:52:40 If 1 then #SDG13 but #SDG4 so people understand. #SDG7 is needed to replace oil. #SDG10 helps to resolve #SDG1, #SDG2, #SDG3 & 
#SDG5. #SDG12 as we have to reduce resource use. Without #SDG6 life is impossible. Without #SDG14 & #SDG15 life is grim. #SDG16 & #SDG17 too. So all 
4265 2018-12-23 21:52:37 i need to try CBD oil for my migraines but it’s so expensive 
4266 2018-12-23 21:52:23 You're doing wonderfully!  I use heavy cream and MCT oil.
Go!  Keep at it during the holiday.  Merry Christmas!
4267 2018-12-23 21:52:14 Olive Oil...Sesame Seeds..? Somebody needs their ass beat

Oil on canvas. 100x100cm
4269 2018-12-23 21:51:52 Well we won’t get into that debate. I eat both. I eat sugar, carbs, the fattiest cuts of meat, loads of oil, nuts, 4-6 eggs at a time etc and I’m 7% bodyfat. That’s just me.
4270 2018-12-23 21:51:51 Lo shale oil US non è buono come l'altro. Non è facilmente raffinabile, troppo leggero, non consente il diesel. I puntini sono più chiari adesso.
4271 2018-12-23 21:51:49 Agreed! I have been questioning for years why Alberta governments have be allowing oil sands expansion to continue unabated. As to the Feds, each & every one of them are scared to death to sit down & start the inevitable: regulation. Only thing that will make a difference.
4272 2018-12-23 21:51:48 ...you think climate change is about where the oil we use domestically is sourced?
4273 2018-12-23 21:51:40 من شوي المحلل فياض قالها عالجديد مع جورج العقده باسيليه بإمتياز وخلصت
4274 2018-12-23 21:51:40 Everyone on the windowsill with one pie being for a discount on artisan olive oil.
4275 2018-12-23 21:51:37 Do you use water soluble oil paints?
4276 2018-12-23 21:51:32 The current low oil prices during end December lull are not sustainable. OPEC is cutting production. In 2015 when prices fell this low, OPEC was boosting production.  Huge difference.
4277 2018-12-23 21:51:21 I finished mine a month ago. Old school but nice clean fragrance. No patchouli oil for me
4278 2018-12-23 21:51:15 Easy. Simply stop using oil products on New Years Eve. Start with yourselves

4280 2018-12-23 21:50:45 The economy of Texas is arms and oil.
4281 2018-12-23 21:50:26 I did Chinese stir fry one night during Hanukkah, for our food cooked in oil. I love the sharing and creating of customs.
4282 2018-12-23 21:50:19 Seems pretty accurate to mine but this scene with my sister we have:

Dec. 23 . Your my awesome big brother, I love you Happy Holidays, [hugs]...

4284 2018-12-23 21:50:12 @realDonaldTrump we don't need sand monkey oil anymore...thanks to you !!!!
4285 2018-12-23 21:50:01 i'm sitting in the chair where oil replied me for the first/only time, hoping for good luck
4286 2018-12-23 21:50:00 Only theft is oil wars
4287 2018-12-23 21:49:56 Except that is NOT TRUE. It doesn't stop drug trafficking. Trump says it does, but experts know that the most of drugs come by sea and air. Drones are being used more often
In 1342 a wall was fairly effective if you had men with tubs of hot oil at the top.  In 2018, not so much.
4288 2018-12-23 21:49:44 How's about you cease all oil and gas production and plough the lingering profits back in to transitioning your business in to renewables? Oil and gas should have no part of a carbon neutral city!
4289 2018-12-23 21:49:38 Turkey didnt move a finger to fight ISIS when they were strong.  

Erdogan, like Assad supported ISIS buying oil and allowing commercial exchanges . . .Because they were fighting the Syrian Rebels and the Kurds

They will massacre the Kurds
How that looks for future US alliances?
4290 2018-12-23 21:49:09 Wastefully burning up the oil backlog and adding CO2 needlessly to the atmosphere, all in support of getting more dirty oil out of the ground spread around the world. Fail.

4297 2018-12-23 21:47:54 Mike, Sirota is making a whole slew of Bernie supporters like myself bent. He purposely tried to make it seem like Beto took corporate oil money. When in fact it was from employees of oil and gas companies. Real shocker in Texas. Also it was less than 1% of his money.
4298 2018-12-23 21:47:44 Shame on you who can't protect their moms and sisters. Shame on you who use them only for your satisfaction. Shame on the media who pour oil on the flames but fail to bring up the real issues

- don’t touch/ fiddle with it 
- don’t use too many products 
-don’t tie it up like jo jo siwa 
- brush it more 
- drink more water

4302 2018-12-23 21:47:03 You're confusing the Syrian rebels with the Kurds. Two totally different groups.

I know our sole purpose of being in Syria is oil, but that still doesnt make Assad a good guy.
4303 2018-12-23 21:46:56 Yeah this is all socialism and has nothing to do with the fact that literally their entire economy is based off of exporting oil. Lets blame socialism on one of the least diversified economies on the planet, based on an incredibly volatile commodity, crashing
4304 2018-12-23 21:46:49 @GlobalBC   I think because the United States re-imposed sanctions on Iran, they are enriching Saudi and Russian oil production to drive down prices and negatively impacting Canadian oil production.
4305 2018-12-23 21:46:39 Tnx for the advice, you have said well. I only with the guy can see this
4306 2018-12-23 21:46:29 why did you ask mary as you do every month if her snap is gone? if she has money? why is that your business? oil, bail, stamps, st johns wart, a storm door --get it?
4307 2018-12-23 21:46:23 Lately reversal of some headwinds: USD stable (EM high carry currencies outperforming), Oil lower, and apparent thaw of trade war. Plus technical position in EM clean since october. Tourists have left.
4308 2018-12-23 21:46:23 just made the chocolate chocolate chip walnut cookies from the #veganomicon cookbook and they're probably some of the best cookies i've ever made. the only change i made was subbing out canola oil for coconut oil. delicious!
4309 2018-12-23 21:46:18 have you ever tried cbd oil? idk if that’s something you’d be into but it really does help! maybe give it a try! helps me sleep better as well.
4310 2018-12-23 21:46:07 LOL buy local oil.  

Nope.

Your government is doing a great job at killing our oil industry.

LOL buy local.
4311 2018-12-23 21:45:41 @JenosonTwit another idea, Shiro hold keef with his tail right and since he's huge as fuck he can bend his body over him or something and not complain, slides his dick in keef mouth. Boom instant tears *Slides some oil to me~*
4312 2018-12-23 21:45:32 @Lionelvinyl aaannnd there it is. The typical response of anti oil. Can’t actually put an argument forward, so resorts to baseless attacks. You STILL haven’t been able to address even one of my arguments.  When you actually want to have a fact based dialogue I’ll be available.

4314 2018-12-23 21:45:12 Endless profit selling moonshine & snake oil as victim hood & discrimination.

If the reality of racial differences was acknowledged a huge industry of lofty experts would lose their positions

& a whole underclass of black youth would have to man up, get a job & be responsible.
4315 2018-12-23 21:45:10 Depends on the aid and why but there is a lot of items in the budget that could be cut. Looking at massive weapon systems for starters. Could also stop subsidizing oil with low prices in national forests and land.
4316 2018-12-23 21:44:46 AND I was amazing!!! i'm like how i'm a bit on wednesday to do that i get castor oil for understanding we just like thank

4320 2018-12-23 21:44:23 Obama is bragging about oil consumption increasing under his administration. I'm glad you're confident humanity will survive. That was the we I was talking about. I'm sure you'll be fine.
4321 2018-12-23 21:44:07 @bakermayfield 's animosity towards Hugh Jackson may have little to do with Hugh now being in the #Bengals locker room and EVERYTHING to do with his tenure in the #Browns locker room. They are oil and water. The water has been likened to Michael Scott. #browns took the fuel.
4322 2018-12-23 21:44:05 EM after massive tail winds to JAN/18 got 4 head winds. Higher US rates, higher USD, higher oil (rare with strong USD) and trade war (never really seen since inception of MSCI EM index).
4323 2018-12-23 21:44:00 I hate the "you need a gun to defend your house" argument. Have you never seen home alone? Just use marbles and olive oil and shit like that
4324 2018-12-23 21:43:39 Oil price went up by shah of Iran and then western countries with Jimmy Carters leadership and bbcpersian supported Islamic opposition to take the power.

4325 2018-12-23 21:43:22 They are smoking that Mexican weed , it will poison your mind.  Somethings added to it , one thing I know of is ignorance oil , it taste like nothing, feelings like nothing , but leaves a dull whinny low pitched thought of emptiness
4326 2018-12-23 21:43:16 If oil wasn't struck Nigeria would have ceased to exist since
4327 2018-12-23 21:43:07 Lots of folks are challenging the Liberals to come up with a better climate plan. That depends though on Alberta stopping expansion of the oil sands. Certainly hope @AndrewScheer will start doing his job and come up with a better climate plan forcing the Libs to up their game.

and tbh, I like Beto. But its important to realize that he definitely has this liability
4330 2018-12-23 21:42:37 Used motor oil makes great fertilizer
4331 2018-12-23 21:41:57 Blimey we are in sinc tonight...just posted that to you. 
4332 2018-12-23 21:41:55 Toast some pine nuts, add olive oil, find some olives
4333 2018-12-23 21:41:38 I’ve never been more amused. When US troops are sent to the Middle East, the #hippies and/or #Liberals march in the streets, trash the area and yell it’s all about the #oil. When the US troops are pulled out of the M E they remain silent or trash #Trump
4334 2018-12-23 21:41:17 That death rattle at the end is one of the most painful and satisfying things about oil pens lol.
4335 2018-12-23 21:41:12 Just saw a billboard for ihop pancakes with the syrup dripping and it looked soooo good but then I remembered it’s motor oil and not real syrup 
4336 2018-12-23 21:41:11 Syria, minerals & oil. Afghanistan, minerals. Now you know why Putin & Tablecloth are celebrating?
4337 2018-12-23 21:41:06 Why can't jiayou be a regular part of the English vocab!!!!! It's such a good and concise word for supporting people! Add oil! 加油!
4338 2018-12-23 21:40:59 Oh, Trump's complaint from the NATO meeting--gotcha! Germans have used that deal to leverage US into lower prices for exported natural gas, but saying it makes them "in cahoots" with Russia is no more true than saying we are with Middle Eastern countries from which we import oil.
4339 2018-12-23 21:40:43 i guess i'm gonna leave this coconut oil for 2 days on my hair because it's too late for me to take the long, warm bath i deserve
4340 2018-12-23 21:40:37 I'm sure someone's probably already mentioned but have you tried CBD Oil? My man has 2 cousins who had struggled since they were kids with seizures and CBD oil helped them slowly get off their meds. It's worth a shot  Hope you feel better. Sending positive vibes your way. 
4341 2018-12-23 21:40:24 That sounds bomb. you should try Infusing some mct oil and throw it in with the gravy.
4342 2018-12-23 21:40:11 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
4343 2018-12-23 21:40:11 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

4346 2018-12-23 21:40:00 Yes and it's great BUT it's hard to tell if a company is using sustainable palm oil when 99.9% of packets just label it as "palm oil" or a different name entirely so I try to avoid it where I can.
4347 2018-12-23 21:39:52 Castor oil, use a small amount and a small teeth comb & comb it thru every night
4348 2018-12-23 21:39:34 But but fundamentals? High leveraged loans? Zombie companies? Trade war? Tariffs? Economy slowdown? Oil prices? Bank liquidity?

4351 2018-12-23 21:39:24 Haha - you have been rumbled - off you go to another thread with your snake oil and your propaganda
4352 2018-12-23 21:39:18 Ngl, I think CBD oil is 80% placebo. I think it works for seizures and stuff, full blast 100%. But for anxiety and other things I feel like it works for people because they desperately need it to work and it's something they haven't tried yet. 

I would love to be proven wrong!
4353 2018-12-23 21:39:09 As Trump & Co conspire with Russia to profit from their #oil and #gas shipped via the new #meltingArctic route & the old #CaspianCorridor (oh hi Cheney) that #Exxon left the #Kurds to be killed over, @RandPaul sez "#WarIsOver".
#ClimateCatastrophes are just beginning. #MerryXmas!
4354 2018-12-23 21:38:57 Who knows the trajectory Nigeria would've taken if 15th January 1966 boys didn't strike? Who knows how we would've been if oil wasn't struck? Who knows where we would've been if Buhari & his junta didn't disrupt our democracy in '83? What about 1993 annulment by IBB? Who knows...
4355 2018-12-23 21:38:41 Somebody told me about the pile the other night. I pray this cream work or we will be going to the doctor to get this oil because all she do is dig all night and we gets no sleep

4369 2018-12-23 21:37:16 You link oil to gold via dollar, plus some stable growth and suddenly people will view travel like they did in the early 60s. Glamorous (and w/o CAB restrictions). The reification of the software covers up the issues. Gastric bypass is same. Improper diet "solved" by closing...
4370 2018-12-23 21:37:16 That isn't what Sirota said though. Sirota lied. Also, I never heard of oil change USA. Keep splitting those hairs though, I get it....it's becoming the primary season.
4371 2018-12-23 21:37:10 Anyone can have body odor. Body odor is caused by bacteria on the skin metabolising sweat and oil produced by the skin. Different people have different smells because everyone has different flora
4372 2018-12-23 21:36:59 Blah blah blah Tory propaganda supported by the msm narrative the thatcherite economics actually cost Britain more in lost taxes higher benefit payments and the waste of north sea oil revenues the rest of Europe protected it's key industries the Tories protected themselves
4373 2018-12-23 21:36:30 It is an issue that Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology could give fossil fuel companies an excuse to keep burning oil, but this will still be short-lived as renewable energy continues to fall in price. #ClimateChange

4378 2018-12-23 21:35:50 If your recipe doesn’t start with “sauté onions and garlic in olive oil” I aint wanna hear it
4379 2018-12-23 21:35:48 Lord dis joker got dat oil in him and will NOT be quiet #whiteboywasted
4380 2018-12-23 21:35:45 In 50 years, all the fuss about crude oil will vapourize. How many oil firms still rank amongst the top10 highest grossing in the world? How many? 

Today, it's all about tech- Tesla, Amazon and all. Electric & hybrid cars are becoming rampant in the West. Nigeria, are you ready?
4381 2018-12-23 21:35:35 US is a top oil producer,its only a matter of time before we invade ourselves 
4382 2018-12-23 21:35:32 Dinner idea: chicken breast seasoned w black pepper, garlic salt, &amp; bread crumbs. Squash &amp; broccoli, light olive oil. Bake 415 ~35min.
4383 2018-12-23 21:35:27 Leftists dont wait for organic acceptance by society over time. They force compliance by any means possible. Being moral and a person of core values is a natural disadvantage against those who have no morality or core values.
4384 2018-12-23 21:35:15 the other day i was fucking around tryna twerk and my knees got to cracking  my friend talmbout “he need some oil” 
4385 2018-12-23 21:35:14 Because buhari denied you to renue  your oil block deal
4386 2018-12-23 21:34:54 How do u not know this? Iraq is a perfect example. We supported Hussein, armed him, even gave him chemical weapons & looked the other way when he used them. But then Hussein refused to give up his oil meet our demands, so he had to go. Didn't have a damn thing to do w/ freedom!
4387 2018-12-23 21:34:29 And they get paid during one of them
4388 2018-12-23 21:34:28 Coconut oil is nice!  I had something needed healed bad and tried EVERYTHING! CRAZIEST thing finally really helped? A foaming oatmeal hogwash! LOL! I was gonna send a pic but can't find it. Extremely healing!!
4389 2018-12-23 21:34:22 Every issue would be fixed we currently have. Couldn’t agree more. Even becoming the next state of America makes sense. They’d become oil independent over night and we would have access to any port of our choice.
4390 2018-12-23 21:34:21 I always know we are in SoCal as soon as we see some oil well rigs

4394 2018-12-23 21:34:06 Now ya feking talking girl! :)
4395 2018-12-23 21:33:56 Incorrect. Someone has intentionally misrepresented donations to Beto’s campaign to have people like you believing he took big donor monies. The donations are all individuals from people who work in oil/gas which practically speaking would be a lot of Texans.
4396 2018-12-23 21:33:46 Expansion stopped with rise of Europe and retraction slowly approaching the centre. End of oil will end this curse on humanity on many good soils . Fun will start when  centre collapse & can't hold any more.
4397 2018-12-23 21:33:43 Salem stop digging theres no oil at the end of this hole.
4398 2018-12-23 21:33:42 Imbibe the squirrel oil, or whatever you do with it. A new war looms.

4400 2018-12-23 21:33:01 US has never provided any political support and is not seking any reassurances. A pullout & YPG defeat hands oil fields over to Turkey. Am hoping PYD can negotiate w/ assad govt.
4401 2018-12-23 21:32:42 What we need to be very aware of here is not how much Beto took from Oil donors BUT how much BERNIE takes from Russia and how much of this twit attacks are from Russian trolls... again. "it is being pushed almost exclusively by Sanders supporters online and in print" benefits RUS
4402 2018-12-23 21:32:42 These mechanics keep making fun of me cause I never got an oil change LMAOOO
4403 2018-12-23 21:32:33 Beto constantly voted to help the oil and gas industry though. His voting record as a member of Congress is very suspect
4404 2018-12-23 21:32:32 It's nice but it's girlie music. Soz ..I don't do girlie music.  I like rock and roll plus!
4405 2018-12-23 21:32:32 Land mass = controlled onshore mining/oil/natural gas/fracking potential.
Land mass = natural resource exploitation, which at 5.5%GDP in Aus, so far, represents considerable potential.

4416 2018-12-23 21:30:49 That’s not a recipe though! That’s punishment. Considering I don’t eat meat anymore I can’5 make them like I used to, but still.. you can do more than salt, pepper and olive oil..

4446 2018-12-23 21:28:13 Saw the lights in use at the oil spill on the A45! They do their job pretty well!!
4447 2018-12-23 21:28:10 Of all the reasons to use our military resources helping prevent the complete genocide of the Kurdish people should be a priority. We destabilized Iraq for Oil (WMDs were false flags)and in Afghanistan we took down the Taliban who were put in place and trained by USA
4448 2018-12-23 21:27:59 I am still employed in the oil industry but have started taking classes outside the industry, just in case. It’s called being in control of your life.
4449 2018-12-23 21:27:55 Both USA and Russia are breaking international law being in Syria without declaring war on a sovereign country. It's an economical war over oil as any other war in the middle east. Think you need to pay attention Sir.

4453 2018-12-23 21:27:23 I’ve looked deep into the average miles these truck can run and over 200k seems to be a very real thing. All you gotta do is show the truck some love (oil changes) and it’ll run forever

How much does it cost to start Atarodo business? Let alone expand it and keep it running.

4469 2018-12-23 21:24:29 I don’t believe any of that homeopathic bullshit but honestly oil diffusers are fucking amazing at relieving cold symptoms.
4470 2018-12-23 21:24:29 damn! With this price I could buy brand new Toyota Camry every time I change Bugatti’s oil 
4471 2018-12-23 21:24:16 Lol I only tried it cuz we didn’t have no coconut oil either

4481 2018-12-23 21:22:58 Amla oil is magic in a bottle. I’ll vouch for that
4482 2018-12-23 21:22:46 Of course the inaction on pipelines is forcing crude oil to rail and in turn it will, not might, impede agriculture shipments. So 2 vital industries will suffer needlessly.
4483 2018-12-23 21:22:39 There is some real flawed thinking  here. NG is one of the cleanest fuels we have for home/office heating. How else are we to heat during power outages as we are presently experiencing? We still need oil for air, water and land travel to bring food to our population.
4484 2018-12-23 21:22:36 A Venezuelan Navy Ship on Patrol between theirs and Guyana’s territorial waters has ordered and forced a Exxon Exploration Ship looking for Oil/Fuel Deposits underwater to

4489 2018-12-23 21:22:14 They lookin to secure their access to our oil resources but the enemy of my enemy is my friend kind of thing.

4491 2018-12-23 21:21:33 No they won't, it would mean 1.5 million people control 30% of Syrian arable land, 80% of its oil, preventing rebuilding, starving the people, preventing refugees from going home, in any case even if the US try to balkanise syria it will only result in a war with Syria or Turkey.

My dressing is a combo of oil and vinegar mixed with dijon, a little mayo (or I guess yogurt could work), red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. I just mix to taste. I like it to be just a tad creamy with a little bite, but it can’t be TOO creamy.
4498 2018-12-23 21:20:33 @BraveTart Hi Stella, I’m looking to make your Snickerdoodles from Bravetart, but I don’t have coconut oil on hand.  Do you think I could sub in an equal amount butter and get a good result?  If not, any other options?  Thanks!

4506 2018-12-23 21:19:19 We all are, but I'm not talking about war or oil. I'm talking about resigning because you don't agree with an order. Pershing didn't agree with the order to withdraw, but he followed the order and remained part of the team. That's what made him great.

Beto VOWED not to accept big oil donations. He accepted them and to date has not returned those donations. He is owned.

4512 2018-12-23 21:18:46 Ain’t it’s the same as putting coconut oil on your skin ? It’s natural right 
4513 2018-12-23 21:18:34 Unfortunately nobody, but like all other Canadian taxpayers, I am paying for CBC to produce their persistent fake news on climate, environment, the oil & gas industry, pipelines etc, that from your twitter id you appear to pay attention to.
4514 2018-12-23 21:18:25 Have they got oil? Not just in the tank but to the burner. Check the pump pressure and that the solenoid is opening. If so then go down the route of having the burner out and check the nozzle, electrodes & HT leads.
4515 2018-12-23 21:17:55 while Washing panties now, disinfectant alone isn't enough we must add anointing oil too... but why can't these guys go and buy akube pants...at least that one will bring dollars

4521 2018-12-23 21:16:44 In one of my Public Speaking classes, we debated what was the superior peanut butter: smooth or crunchy.  

One student said crunchy, if for any other reason, it keeps the peanut oil in check and less slimey.

This was a few years ago. I think about it at least once a month.
4522 2018-12-23 21:16:38 On Saturday Kitchen, Nigel Slater suggested adulterating the leftover bread sauce with soy, Tabasco, whole grain mustard and rapeseed oil. Why he didn’t make a new sauce I don’t know.

4525 2018-12-23 21:16:09 Want fried dumpling but I don’t have any oil 
4526 2018-12-23 21:16:08 Crazy thought, but maybe not being in full resistance mode might alleviate some of this. 
A large number wont even sit at the table, and it's kinda like voting. If you don't vote, how much is your opinion worth?

4529 2018-12-23 21:15:56 There's suspicious links behind even the Kurds, we know they were given disproportionate power in Iraq after Saddam fell to essentially give away the oil to Israel for free.

NATO and the UN are religions of peace.

4536 2018-12-23 21:14:59 Incorrect. He, your great leader, has repeatedly bragged about how the oil prices have come down due to Saudi’s lowering prices. We are not independent and still import. Please continue to live in your fantasy world if Trump. Have yourself a Merry Christmas and please learn to
4537 2018-12-23 21:14:59 You are the one thay is uneducated about how the world works. America has an abundance of all resources this includes wood, metal, fertile ground for crops, and oil. We have more oil in America than anything we could get from thr middle east. Even so, we are switching to solar

4545 2018-12-23 21:14:06 The protests and complaints would be equally strong if Oil was at $120/barrel.

This is pre-election fear mongering, at its Conservative worst. 

Complete bullshit.
4546 2018-12-23 21:13:53 That oil be so bomb
4547 2018-12-23 21:13:44 AMEN! Dems & GOP just two wings of the same vulture. Each beholden to Wall St., Big Oil, Big Insurance, Big Pharma, Military & Prison industrial Complexes. Blow it up, burn it down and start over.
4548 2018-12-23 21:13:20 Idk, I think that any political party needs to leverage culture and media to create interest and all the organization will happen organically because people are interested.
4549 2018-12-23 21:13:01 Without oil we wouldn't have plastic stir sticks we all use to stir our hot beverages. Do you want that? #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming

4551 2018-12-23 21:12:53 Well every nation has stolen. But China is on a whole different level. They literally encourage knock off companies and literally produce so many fake items. The baby milk crisis this year? Fake toxic beer? Fake rice? Dirty cooking oil? The country is a disaster.

4553 2018-12-23 21:12:36 With olive oil (?) still good tho
4554 2018-12-23 21:12:31 Funny, it's not so bad. With all this supposed corruption and collusion, one wonders how that is. Seriously, 92% negative news stories. Still above 20% in stock market, employment all time high,  now #1 producer of oil in the world ...Nothing but inuendo. We're in good shape.
4555 2018-12-23 21:12:31 So you have no idea what’s in it for America basically.  You gave verbal diarrhea for an answer because you don’t have one.  There is no benefit to the American citizen.  The only benefits are to the oil companies
4556 2018-12-23 21:12:29 It’s true. Why are we building up the Middle East- let the wealthy oil rich countries do that not us.

4561 2018-12-23 21:11:52 "His votes favored oil companies."

We are talking about the Beto O'Rourke with the  2017 League of Conservation Voters rating of 100% (95% lifetime)? Right?

And we are talking about the Beto O'Rourke who took no PAC money, right? (Unlike Bernie Sanders, who took PAC money).

4564 2018-12-23 21:11:03 From Oil and Gas CEOs. And I mentioned that you idiot. Stop turning into a corncob from the fact any examination of Beto's record means he's just a flavor of the month candidate who comes up every elections cycle and goes nowhere.
4565 2018-12-23 21:10:55 It's even better if you make your own:) Try this in a blender: can drained chick peas, 2 clove garlic, bit of sea salt, splash of lemon juice, & 1or 2 drops of (the brand that's safe to ingest like doterra)lemon essential oil,  a little olive oil Add more olive oil if too thick

4574 2018-12-23 21:09:44 then when you look at how long Texans live and how many people don’t have proper medical care, it’s clear they don’t have the formula...And this is with Texas being able to have lower taxes bc of its oil wealth.  It’s a model won’t work in other states.
4575 2018-12-23 21:09:42 That’s also during the same period decreasing net crude oil imports by 60%. But yeah, Obama never did anything right for climate change.
4576 2018-12-23 21:09:39 The Oil crisis followed the Yom Kippur War with Egypt & the other 5 Arab League Nations.
That was 1973.
I am talking about the UK being screwed by the Unions in the 1950s through to the 1970s before we joined the EEC
4577 2018-12-23 21:09:33 Especially when it’s over flooded with oil 
4578 2018-12-23 21:09:26 if I go one more day without an oil change I'm gonna spray my load all over the fucking parking lot
4579 2018-12-23 21:09:23 America does not gain resources by fighting wars in the middle east. We lose more money, resources, and gain more debt from middle east wars. The reason we are there is to keep radical Islam contained from spreading. We don't need middle east oil we have plenty here & going solar

4585 2018-12-23 21:08:07 Oil is not falling in a vacuum, look at industrial commodities in general and you see a similar similar pattern. Meanwhile the Fed is more concerned about accelerating #inflation The price instability is on the downside.
4586 2018-12-23 21:07:53 my first cat seymour have been FIXING oil prices
4587 2018-12-23 21:07:50 With 50k, I'd be able to start palm oil production....
4588 2018-12-23 21:07:45 Brit. I dont like how it came down either but we allowed Iran to fill a void in Iraq and Iraq has big reserves of oil that can fuel Iran aggression. What are our strategic interests in Syria? We removed Isis 99% . Cant hang around for the 1000 year war betw sunni and shia
4589 2018-12-23 21:07:20 #WarForProfit is wrong. D.T. did the right thing. Stop being world police, killing brown people & stealing oil. CBC: stop promoting lies.
4590 2018-12-23 21:07:20 I was very meh on Beto. But I am now all in on Cop/Oil Baron 2020
4591 2018-12-23 21:07:18 Afghanistan and Iraq are all on Bush II . Syria was Obama and against Assad s inhumanitarian use of chemical warfare. AND Iran and Russian desire for a direct route to the sea for an oil pipeline. For Russia.
4592 2018-12-23 21:07:13 I was cool with Truffle Oil until I found out it was from mushrooms...
4593 2018-12-23 21:07:11 Seriously? He's a self described non progressive who hoards cash from oil and gas execs and has a billionaire real estate developer father in law. The jig's up on this one NBC.
4594 2018-12-23 21:07:08 Raw sewage, heating oil or anything else flows away from Quebec so what does it matter.
4595 2018-12-23 21:07:03 Buy palm oil free products kids!
4596 2018-12-23 21:07:03 @sonicdrivein can we get a health inspector at the location here in Antioch, Tennessee? I sent my food back after getting VERY old tenders to still get old food. I’m sure my food was cooked in old cooking oil. I’d hate to get sick from this....
4597 2018-12-23 21:06:46 Cold engine oil is bae
4598 2018-12-23 21:06:35 Work the math. They are throwing billions to the oil patch?  Am not aware of any true subsidies or grants for the Oilpatch. Everything is either an investment or a commercial loan. 

And given the Paris Accord is non-binding - do you think most other countries are ignoring? Yup.

4605 2018-12-23 21:06:10 i think it's a default position where white People don't have to go thinking about systemic racism, or how their society in itself (like capitalism and oil, and imposing their laws and culture upon us) is inherently genocidal, or how to reject all that.
4606 2018-12-23 21:05:46 Copying what's effective is not a bad idea. 
This Cortez woman, a total flake, beat an incumbent. Vote harvesting defeated R's in CA.
The devious nature of the left puts them steps ahead. Where were the R vote harvesters, will we have any in 2020?
4607 2018-12-23 21:05:45 No not all but coconut oil far as I read up on.
4608 2018-12-23 21:05:33 Oil slick leap
4609 2018-12-23 21:05:31 Lets drain as much oil we can and lets get out in peace  This agenda keeps repeating it self time after time 
4610 2018-12-23 21:05:24 Silly question but do you worry about companies like $bte going bankrupt with these low oil prices and their debt? Wasn't on my radar but read some stupid monkey fool report usually dont
4611 2018-12-23 21:05:15 I need it for chicken and a bottle of oil ooo. I can't afford to buy this for now cuz of the thin size of my bank account. Private schools have vacated, meaning no salary for December. Biko

4614 2018-12-23 21:04:54 i have food poisoning but i can't stop thinking about how much i love when they give you toasted but still soft french bread and little dipping bowls of olive oil and herbs for the bread. really a fucking stunner of an appetizer
4615 2018-12-23 21:04:41 The best part of my day is the moment I put my fluffy robe on my tingling skin after waking up before the sun rises, rubbing almond oil all over my body, and massaging and pounding on my lymph nodes under an ice cold shower. Euphoria. 10/10 recommend.

4617 2018-12-23 21:04:31 These shortcuts are, mostly, snake oil. You will invest your time better learning other, more down to earth and time tested, reading strategies.

4624 2018-12-23 21:03:42 Felt so good to be back inside Lucas Oil... Go Horse 
4625 2018-12-23 21:03:40 Эй, вы мне сломали голову первее. Значит и дата смерти раньше. Тем более я уже очередь заняла.
4626 2018-12-23 21:03:37 Went and got a massage today and the lady used her CBD oil all over... my pain level is almost non existent. That stuff is Magic for chronic pain management!

4633 2018-12-23 21:02:44 How about cooking oil?

4635 2018-12-23 21:02:42 This isn't the lord of the rings, we do not have 'Magical words'.
If you think we do I have some snake oil that will clear that right up.
4636 2018-12-23 21:02:30 Sigh, it was in response to shit management and the problems caused by the doubling of the oil price after the wars in the Middle east.
4637 2018-12-23 21:02:28 I think @deshaunwatson has baby oil on him the way he slips away from defenders!  #Texans #GoTexans
4638 2018-12-23 21:02:25 Really? Hmm. Let's see Prison reform, denuclearization of NK, passing of bill to revitalize the inner cities and help people of color become more prosperous. First time ever, were exporters of oil. Hmm.

4646 2018-12-23 21:01:49 The stipulation by Oil Change USA is that you pledge not to take money from Oil/Gas PACS and Executives. He broke the latter. Betoa has also since removed the pledge from his website.
4647 2018-12-23 21:01:09 Watson got some damn baby oil his ass so slick
4648 2018-12-23 21:01:03 I am definitely buying some and noticed the Palm Oil Free notice 
4649 2018-12-23 21:00:58 I am guilty of that one lol to lazy to go get an oil change

4651 2018-12-23 21:00:43 If you had a reasoned point beyond spouting off a string of insubstantial, hyperbolic talking points it may have deserved more than an lol as a response. I live in Alberta, my personal income is 100% derived from the sale of oil. But I'm a hippy. Sorry my amusement triggered you.

4654 2018-12-23 21:00:09 The amount of crude oil lifted per day is still unknown 

The amount of income earned daily through the sell of crude oil is still unknown 

The number of oil block license issued is still unknown 

Buhari, the fraudulent man of fake integrity, is the minister of petroleum
4655 2018-12-23 21:00:07 I wonder how much Dawn liquid it will take to clean the black oil from these magnificent creatures when the oil lords have their inevitable spills.
4656 2018-12-23 21:00:07 If the @liberal_party wanted to phase out oil in the near future, they sure have a funny way of showing it, tossing billions of $$ to buy a pipeline & invest new clean technology. I guess if your sweetie bought you new truck, you would think she was telling you to hit the road ?
4657 2018-12-23 21:00:04 @lowetide I hope u have ur heart medication with u. #EaglesD
4658 2018-12-23 20:59:59 Definitely! I think it's harmless to wash w water, but soaps are drying. I like using a little rose/lavender/orange blossom/etc water mixed w water as a light astringent, and moisturizing w a light oil right after. I like sunflower w a little tea tree oil
4659 2018-12-23 20:59:57 When the rice and oil hit the house
4660 2018-12-23 20:59:56 I get that you believe Trump is delivering on campaign promises. Ordinarily, that would hold some merit. It’s just that all those promises are terrible policy. I don’t want deregulation of health and safety provisions, nor judges who decide prior to hearing the case. No thanks.
4661 2018-12-23 20:59:51 Too? What?

What is the difference between getting massive paychecks from the CEO's from these companies and the companies themselves? Certainly isn't effecting his voting record on behalf of Big Oil, whose boots Beto licks.
4662 2018-12-23 20:59:39 It was good! Just veggies, garlic, olive oil and angel hair pasta.
4663 2018-12-23 20:59:33 Obama just told a room of oil execs to thank him for making the us a bigger oil producing nation so yeah I'd say he was not in fact up to the task
4664 2018-12-23 20:59:32 Then use the strained coconut oil,  I usually end up with a few ounces of it,  can use butter too.  Can get dozens of CBD edibles or dinners with that $90 z
4665 2018-12-23 20:59:27 So it can't hear the oil in the pan getting hot
4666 2018-12-23 20:59:09 Hia, red oil? 
Julius why, na so e bad reach?
4667 2018-12-23 20:59:06 Colts score to get the lead and of course they play Wipe Me Down in Lucas Oil lmao
4668 2018-12-23 20:59:00 brand new cart & all the fucking oil just spilled out of it great
4669 2018-12-23 20:58:56 AND REMEMBER don’t overbeat/stir your mix (it’ll become dry) and butter will do what oil just can’t..

I believe in you! Rock out, Rox !
4670 2018-12-23 20:58:52 No one thinks we should stay much longer, but... coordinating an exit strategy with allies, insuring oil fields in eastern Syria where we are currently engaged do not fall to Isis to further fund their global is necessary before leaving
4671 2018-12-23 20:58:50 Holy water is behind this. You make like oil
4672 2018-12-23 20:58:39 おまえはちゃんとやれ
4673 2018-12-23 20:58:36 Не надо. В очереди в загробный мир ты после меня. А мне нужно пока мозг свой собрать и сложить аккуратненько
4674 2018-12-23 20:58:32 ...I need an oil change
4675 2018-12-23 20:58:31 Sheesh all oil?
4676 2018-12-23 20:58:31 Wolfgang, you got me wrong. I wasn't talking about legacy car makers. I was talking about the fossil fuel industry (oil, coal, gas.) That's a lot more than gas for cars.
My point was other industries are more subsidized.
Legacy car makers can have EV subsidies when they sell EVs.
4677 2018-12-23 20:58:13 If your good at changing oil but your boss keeps asking you to change wiper blades then who is to blame? You for being slow at blades or him for not using you the best way possible?
4678 2018-12-23 20:58:04 Argan oil smells v good
4679 2018-12-23 20:58:02 I'm not sure what you're arguing, but if it's that soy and soybean oil are healthy, you're crazy. I agree, they provide plenty of calories, about the last thing the world needs now.
4680 2018-12-23 20:58:01 Alrighty Eli. Another 4th qrtr comeback in Lucas Oil?
4681 2018-12-23 20:57:56 Kinda a rash? I’m trying three tea oil
4682 2018-12-23 20:57:44 Holy shit..269kr for olive oil?? Is it made of golden olives? 
4683 2018-12-23 20:57:44 Fun fact: the transformer in my village hasn't worked for 2 years cos niggas kept stealing oil from it. So they stopped even operating it. Generator is our only source of power.
4684 2018-12-23 20:57:41 Trump only pulling out after his and Israel defeat. No more Oil and resources to steal

4688 2018-12-23 20:57:31 CNN is a war hawk station. Corporate media like corporate profit from arms sales and dead brown babies. Stolen oil is the American way.
4689 2018-12-23 20:57:20 He is so frustratingly non political too Paul. Don't know where I got him??? :P Was born during the Coal/oil strikes '73..someone must have switched him when the lights were oot! :P :D
4690 2018-12-23 20:57:04 @jimmyjohns why would you ruin an Italian sandwich with mayo? The point of that sandwich is to not ruin it with mayo, and use oil/vinegar instead. Now here I am throwing away a perfectly otherwise fine sandwich with no time to go back and get another
4691 2018-12-23 20:56:38 I use several different brands. Walnut Hollow (but they discontinued their oil pencils ). Rose-Art. Crayola (really). LiquiMark. The metallics are The Fine Touch from Hobby Lobby. I mix ink and pencil to get the deep colors.
4692 2018-12-23 20:56:29 a family is surprised to put together they make together in sonic mania wrestlers is so tired and i heard the oil.
4693 2018-12-23 20:56:22 Well a company showed him just that, but Big oil didn’t like it.
4694 2018-12-23 20:56:21 You taste good Brother. What is that i’m tasting, Cocoanut oil?
4695 2018-12-23 20:56:18 В класическата си дълга рецепта, да. Аз често го правя по като T Punch.

At what cost? I'll never know
4706 2018-12-23 20:54:45 And we take entire countries full of them and governed by them seriously. Why I always wanted to not depend on them for one gallon of oil. Let them exterminate each other
4707 2018-12-23 20:54:44 And I have already finished my 12 contracts in ETS2! Time to burn some oil in my VNL 760's engine in ATS to take there 12 contracts!

4710 2018-12-23 20:54:11 So how long do you want to stay in Afghanistan and Syria and why? We have oil independence, we cannot remold their societies. It will be 200 years before they are fit for a modern world.
4711 2018-12-23 20:54:10 Its always been about Greed. And our failure to accept our own deaths. We need a global enconomy that is not so fully encompassed by oil and arms. #OurPlanetNeedsOurConsciousness
4712 2018-12-23 20:54:10 Have they recently had an oil delivery. Check oil filters , clean burner head and photo cell. Check baffles / sooting. Analyse Co2 around 13% O2 around 3 %
4713 2018-12-23 20:54:07 Let's say it is. This is why you care about thousands of miles away? Is your oil reduced? Are you afraid of the end of the American dream? When you get out of Muslim countries, those countries will be happy. Are you the gendarmerie of the world?
4714 2018-12-23 20:53:55 Declining and mostly eliminated. Back in 1970s oil crises, Canada’s outlook for conventional oil was very limited. Exploration and development incentives helped produce the offshore and oil sands that provide  the energy security and #1 export revenue we enjoy today.

Check your air conditioner pressure. Simple refills at the store. Bug wash, oil change, ck tires & go.

4723 2018-12-23 20:51:47 Being in Lucas Oil Stadium right now is stressful.
4724 2018-12-23 20:51:38 I haven't even noticed a "war." I was a pretty big Fan of both of them until I saw Beto was supported heavily by Big Oil. But I'll vote for either in the general election.
4725 2018-12-23 20:51:35 Apparently Lindt has it too. Buying palm oil free Nocilla tomorrow. Like Nutella but palm oil free. Making pancakes on Christmas morning. 
4726 2018-12-23 20:51:31 That's perfectly fair and entirely reasonable. But that's not what Sirota (e.g.) is doing when he attacks O'Rourke for accepting donations from oil company employees.

4732 2018-12-23 20:50:31 Now add on the tariffs we’d accrue from transporting our oil through Canada, the leasing of Port Waters in BC, as well as the added diplomatic and social costs of becoming a new, landlocked nation. Separation would be foolish, shortsighted, and incredibly damaging.
4733 2018-12-23 20:50:24 That’s just where you dump everything in Quebec sewage heating oil anything you want goes in the river because it’s socially acceptable
4734 2018-12-23 20:50:08 You buying first thing Monday morning? Any other sectors look appetizing? Bio? Oil? Natty?

4736 2018-12-23 20:49:58 That place looks good, do they sell the flavors without the CBD?  They have 5000 mg full spectrum coconut for $230, you get 5000mg out of an ounce that is 17.5% CBD, that cost 90 at tweedle, then cook that on low in a crock for about 2 hrs w/ $5 worth of coconut oil saves $100

4738 2018-12-23 20:49:52 I've never cooked collards but I do cook other greens and ugh I'd never cook them without cooking down some bacon first and using that fat... I feel like olive oil just wouldn't cut it.
4739 2018-12-23 20:49:46 Sweet potato fries are easy and delicious - cut up potatoes, toss in bowl with olive oil, add some kosher salt and bake for 20-25 minutes. May need more or less time depending on size of cut fries.

4745 2018-12-23 20:48:42 Are you saying that the Kurds don't actually exist and were made up by the oil & weapons industries? Because if not your argument is incredibly hollow.

I already stay hydrated and run a humidifier + use a ton of oil externally + internally, but it's just not enough. 
Thank you in advance! — looking for dry skin relief
4749 2018-12-23 20:47:51 Grandmothers from the south are looking at this recipe in disgust. Where is the hamhock at. And olive oil Wth u know it’s bacon grease 
4750 2018-12-23 20:47:48 I find it interesting that a heating oil leak into the river demands concern yet Quebec repeatedly dumps refuse into the St Lawrence and it’s socially acceptable. Hmmmmmm
4751 2018-12-23 20:47:41 Alberta has transferred 220 billion dollars into Canada with equalization money. If the liberals government has its way and phases out oil. This will effect all of Canada.  That’s only equalization money.
4752 2018-12-23 20:47:27 Oil appears to be following the SP500. Both moving on growth fears. News out of China today the talks are going well on IP transfers. New defense sec in place. Might be a good week!
4753 2018-12-23 20:47:12 Dummy, this started when people realized how much money could be made from oil and realized there was a crap load in the middle east! So what 125, 150 yr's ago! Can you get any fact right at all??? Or even come close???

4756 2018-12-23 20:46:21 That 'horrible' Iran deal Corker helped craft stopped Iran from moving forward on working on a nuclear weapon, and got Iranian oil on the market to reduce the amount of money going to Saudi Arabia. What a monster.
4757 2018-12-23 20:46:17 Okay, copy their playbook and start TELLING these young people what to do.
4758 2018-12-23 20:46:08 I really don't know enough. Tired of our people being away from home

4761 2018-12-23 20:45:54 I said the USA spends $7 billion a year on Russian oil. Only a completely foolish person could say those numbers aren't facts or can be manipulated.  You're just sore because I destroyed your point with truth.

4763 2018-12-23 20:45:49 incredible correction of the oil price. maybe hard to see it recover to the recent highs
4764 2018-12-23 20:45:44 Erdogan is the father of isis . Turkey had a great relationship with isis . They were buying oil from isis for half the price and USA was aware of that .
4765 2018-12-23 20:45:42 Try it and see for yourself. Certainly not snake oil.
4766 2018-12-23 20:45:41 Uuuhhhh... the deal that was keeping Iran from seeking nuclear weapons and which dropped oil prices that you tore up for no reason?
4767 2018-12-23 20:45:37 I would advise about the Ibiza high 1.6Mpi engine listed in the car, because there are rumors that it is an engine that consumes a lot of oil at the expense of piston friction with the cylinder, to help me buy.

Not saying all these are good, but they are creative in getting out votes

4782 2018-12-23 20:44:30 Yes I can sleep.  But, dont think these same issues are not world wide.  They are.  The true base problem with a nuclear plant is that unlike a Gas or Oil plant when you shut them off the heat stops generating.  When you stop the gas flow the plant stops producing heat.  Not with
4783 2018-12-23 20:44:25 We can pray that the Trump economy, the oil independence, et al Trump has enough muscle to overcome these elitists who want the American people impoverished.

4788 2018-12-23 20:44:02 And Saudi Arabia has been backed by the USA and the rest of NATO for a long while despite being pretty far-right because of the oil and how Saudi Arabia was able to fund various extremist groups and schools of thought

4806 2018-12-23 20:41:40 Frankincense is so underrated as an essential oil. Mix it with some lavender and you have the best diffusing scent.
4807 2018-12-23 20:41:34 Prices did respond but the general market weakness is dragging everything down. Nice to see they are committed to higher prices though at all costs. Not a good time to short oil now.

4840 2018-12-23 20:37:16 then there's the geopolitical implications of oil dependence. more plastic = more oil = more money & political support to oppressive regimes. I think on balance I'd prefer glass.

4863 2018-12-23 20:33:51 It's much more complicated than that I think.  One of the reasons Gaddafi was taken out is because he tried to change the money system to the Dinar.  Hussein did the same thing - changed the money system to purchase oil from the dollar to the  Euro.

4867 2018-12-23 20:33:21 I'm so pissed at the fact that the worst burn I gave myself was from an oil splatter and not from the proper fire situations I created on the grill I was using

4871 2018-12-23 20:32:54 Love the idea of the potato peels but I need more directions. Temperature? Time? How much oil and how long to soak? It sounds yummy and I want to try it.
4872 2018-12-23 20:32:52 You know what, when we moved from coal to oil it was a major improvement, and moving from oil to natural gas has been a major advancement.
4873 2018-12-23 20:32:50 Taking the reigns of power away from Trump but leaving them in the hands of Wall Street and Gas & Oil, Big Real estate and other corporate interests would be a Hollow victory imo.
4874 2018-12-23 20:32:34 Yeah, do you realize health insurance isn't even true insurance? Imagine your auto insurance being the same. You'd fill out paperwork and get something back for every oil change. Or home insurance, perhaps I'll sign after my house burns down. Logic much?
4875 2018-12-23 20:32:31 But why were you rubbing your eyeballs with coconut oil in the first place!? 
4876 2018-12-23 20:32:19 Ah, yes. "Do your own homework." In other words, Kelley, you have no evidence. 
This, from the same nutbar who thinks a combo of habanero peppers, garlic, ginger plus emulsified cod liver oil will “balance your metabolism” and erase cancerous tumors.

4903 2018-12-23 20:29:46 My sarcasm is directed at the Denial Industry (backed by Big Oil). Yes, I'm speaking of BECCS and beyond. There are CCS net negative that are in operation. It's ramp up costs to scale of these newer tech that is required even with current carbon reduction goals met.

4908 2018-12-23 20:28:47 What are you talking about? Oil and gas isn't much of a sector in Ontario at all.
4909 2018-12-23 20:28:39 Rationality in the 1970s held that oil was running out, so we should consume less today. But rationality was wrong. There are other reasons to consume less oil but economic rationality is not one of them. Therefore, economic rationality, which always assumes scarcity, is useless.

Then Yahweh was jealous for his land, And had pity on his people.

Yahweh answered his people, “Behold, note I will send you grain, new wine, and oil, and you will be satisfied with them; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.
4919 2018-12-23 20:27:04 The 10% move in oil correlated with a huge move in SP500. You need to know the cause/effect of what is moving. Oil does not just move on its' own unless an inventory report or skirmish causes it to move. Fundamentals are bullish but general mkt sentiment is pulling everythingdown

If Saddam was allowed to take over Kuwait’s oil fields, he would have likely invaded Iran and effectively controlled the world’s oil supplies and had our economy on our knees.

4961 2018-12-23 20:22:36 I used to think the same thing.  If anything, this episode in US politics has revealed how dysfunctional DC is and how much we are being played.  Red vs. Blue is a distraction.  How many Dems are taking oil or arms manufacturer money?  How much influence do voters actually have?
4962 2018-12-23 20:22:25 Potatoes are considered a vegetable.  If you are making mashed potatoes, cook them a day ahead with a small amount of oil, chill for about 24 hours, and they will create resistant starch.  Rice does this, too.  That will reduce the carb load for humans, and feeds good gut flora.
4963 2018-12-23 20:22:19 Nice thought though, but would that condition extend to life outside their own sovereignty? So for instance would we stop selling weapons by law? Or regime changing because of minerals/oil?

4993 2018-12-23 20:19:13 I take fish oils not only for working out, but the positives affects of omegas 3. Helps my MH significantly. MCT oil is a really good supplement. I use to add a teaspoon to my coffee when I use to drink that crap. 
4994 2018-12-23 20:19:06 What is it you expect our PM to do? He's invested in two pipelines, one of which is delivering oil and generating revenue for Albertans and Canadians, and the other pipeline awaits approval. There are no easy steps, here.
4995 2018-12-23 20:18:57 The north was doing just fine before the oil rent. There's a need to revert to fiscal federalism to make leaders think outside oil rent.
4996 2018-12-23 20:18:56 Beard oil wtf!!! Do share

4998 2018-12-23 20:18:46 Is there anything on this earth more delicious than sesame oil?
4999 2018-12-23 20:18:44 Not at all... My husband got it.. he was excited he got something special.. Behold the palm oil mix...
Indomie onion forever!
I hope you had a good weekend...
5000 2018-12-23 20:18:36 Oil =/= coal. Natural gas =/= coal
5001 2018-12-23 20:18:31 Yo so I gotta get new slacks for New year's cause my friends like to be boujee one day out of the year. I also gotta get a synthetic oil change. And since I decided to be cautious I checked out my tired and I need new ones  New Year starting off broke lmao
5002 2018-12-23 20:18:31 Climate change is elephant in room. Alberta a leader in sustainability in oil & gas but planet's warming is speaking for itself. Liberals will hinder oil industry with carbon pricing that doesn't include expanded pipeline transport. We have little in place for alternate energies
5003 2018-12-23 20:18:29 Yup dropped the oil and the barrel right on his head from a the top of the Peace Tower. Make sure it is Alberta oil!
5004 2018-12-23 20:18:19 Slits. I cut the garlic cloves in half lengthwise so they're skinnier and sharper. Then I stab the roast with a sharp paring knife, pull it out, and slide the garlic in. You can't add too much. I coat the cloves in salt, pepper, & olive oil first to infuse flavor. Bon appetit!
5005 2018-12-23 20:18:17 Oil Changes Done Got A Lil Pricey
5006 2018-12-23 20:18:11 Are u still using purpul hair oil?

5008 2018-12-23 20:17:41 Chef Louis cut up some live rats, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some  human flesh, along with Play-Doh.
5009 2018-12-23 20:17:32 The gov't just gave yet another $1.6B to the oil industry. That's on top of the $4.6B for a pipeline, which is all on top of the billions they give the industry in subsidies. Kinder Morgan pd no taxes in 2017. Just how much does this industry need w/a yr of $46.6B in profits?
5010 2018-12-23 20:17:25 Imo when oil bounces (opec plunge protection team incoming) will lead short term bounce on sp500 (similar to early 2016)
5011 2018-12-23 20:17:22 AB oil sector has never been content with profits as greed strikes all levels
In bust times streets are lined with expensive toys of all sorts bearing for sale signs
Albertans live in denial of busts & are great at building debt
Then they blame gov & other prov when $ is tight
5012 2018-12-23 20:17:20 I’m so slack I still haven’t made myself more Nourishing oil 
5013 2018-12-23 20:17:19 Is that why Pelosi put in a Oil Money Grubber the head of "The New Green Deal?"  Sure they accept it, but, they still love they're oil money.  To bad you aren't up to speed on reality politics.
5014 2018-12-23 20:17:01 I felt like it was inappropriate to keep her as a friend if I was just reading her updates to drink delicious oil?
5015 2018-12-23 20:16:54 Not an oil and gas expert. But fairly certain that British Petroleum has some operations in the UK.
5016 2018-12-23 20:16:42 As a dem, u know wht's an alarming put off? How Beto's pushed as the rising star while his pockets are deep in Big Oil (during a climate crisis, no less!), how he wants 2deregulate banks by reforming the already lax dodd-frank (criminal!), & how he's been a TPP enthusiast (vile!)

5019 2018-12-23 20:16:34 I will not procrastinate putting up my Christmas tree or getting an oil change anymore. I will not procrastinate putting up my Christmas tree or getting an oil change anymore. I will not procrastinate putting up my Christmas tree or getting an oil change anymore. 
5020 2018-12-23 20:16:31 We caught a glimpse of an angel with 6 intimidatingly huge wings, made of oil. It gave us a deck of cards.

5024 2018-12-23 20:15:58 Are there birds or bats inside Lucas Oil?
5025 2018-12-23 20:15:55 Breaking news: lots of people in Texas work in the oil industry it’s a pretty big deal down here
5026 2018-12-23 20:15:53 I read yesterday that oil industry sector workers represent 1.4% of Canadian workers, so it's easy to see why they need special treatment. 
5027 2018-12-23 20:15:37 This is the theory indeed, but it deeply understimates Russian leverage. Assad & Russia won't stay idle. For instance, strategic DeirEzzor's oil fields are vital for Assad.
5028 2018-12-23 20:15:11 that would take a whole bulb of garlic and at least a cup of oil to be tasty 
5029 2018-12-23 20:15:10 Dark skinned women being saying that for ages tho. They’re fetishized and only praised when they’re hourglass/pear shaped wearing little to nothing and covered in oil.
5030 2018-12-23 20:15:09 missing context: O'Rourke didn't take money from corporate pacs & the donations attributed to the oil/gas business are from a handful of execs & many others from lower-level employees of his home state's main industry. They account for 1/2  of 1% of all of money he raised.
5031 2018-12-23 20:14:49 いい感じです(^^;)
5032 2018-12-23 20:14:36 You’re welcome. That’s interesting that a social worker would talk about that, but you never know in today’s world. Death is of course the end all, but not reasonable. Prison, and fish oil supplements are the two most effective treatments we have.
5033 2018-12-23 20:14:33 I wish my victories were celebrated as much as one colts touchdown at Lucas oil 
5034 2018-12-23 20:14:30 Mlima Kilimanjaro upo hapo Moshi hauhitaji kubadilisha oil wala plugs,.. Wameshindwa kuutumia kuleta elimu na afya bora,.. Wataweza na ndege 7... 
5035 2018-12-23 20:14:24 So exactly why the fuck would a country with Scotland's oil reserves not aspire to emulate Norway? 
Are you normally stupid?
5036 2018-12-23 20:14:21 So long as oil prices stay it effects putin and his gangster cronies I don’t have any problems with that good analysis from Jlee as always

5038 2018-12-23 20:14:12 And I'm still completely baffled* as to why there hasn't been a larger push to get these people jobs in alternative energy programs. If they can work a pipeline, they can build solar panels and wind turbines. 

*not really baffled. Big Oil holds sway; politicians love money.
5039 2018-12-23 20:14:11 And we p....d our oil money away on tax cuts, courtesy of Thatcher & the Tories
5040 2018-12-23 20:13:56 Maybe Trump thinks Syria is Iraq? (The never ending war reference.)

All he cared about was taking the oil as spoils of war.
Once he found out that’s a war crime even with a brilliant POTUS like him, he didn’t see any sense in being over there. (I am not joking either.)
5041 2018-12-23 20:13:56 The government is sending the wrong message. Yes oil and gas is 10 percent of gdp and if the resources were probably managed it would be much more then 10 percent GDP.   Anyone with common sense would be supporting alberta right now.  Unless you want to see a housing crash.
5042 2018-12-23 20:13:48 if margaritas count as baking I can make in like 54433 different flavors. Or you can make an italian stuff: focaccia with Nutella. it’s basically a white pizza with salt and olive oil and you put Nutella on it!
5043 2018-12-23 20:13:41 Looks great. So is the petrol Co-op brand too? I don't see any oil company brand.
5044 2018-12-23 20:13:39 I’m sitting in the drive thru oil change place horny af because the mechanic started barking orders at me LMFAO I NEED ASSISTANCE
5045 2018-12-23 20:13:28 Syria, the gateway to your shipping route for oil and opium poppy. There's no way you're leaving that unattended.
5046 2018-12-23 20:13:19 got my brother his own oil pen set-up for xmas lol he better appreciate this shit
5047 2018-12-23 20:13:12 Went to a dispensary today to get my husband some CBD oil for Christmas, came home smelling like weed and he now has his gift early  didn’t think it through lol
5048 2018-12-23 20:12:57 リクエストは受け付けないぜ！
5049 2018-12-23 20:12:57 The oil crash? That’s weird considering how Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Middle East is.
5050 2018-12-23 20:12:54 Yeah how dare he put lives in peril by bringing them home.  How dare he not continue to spend trillions of American tax payer dollars to help the Kurds protect THEIR oil.  How dare he
5051 2018-12-23 20:12:40 Oil did not collapse last week ??? WTI started the week at 51.25 and ended at like 45.40......That is a 10pct+ fall. In one week !!!!!
5052 2018-12-23 20:12:37 Hes setting that aside for thousands of oil paintings of himself
5053 2018-12-23 20:12:27 hot oil treatment  protein treatment 
5054 2018-12-23 20:12:01 strange New Years resolution: start changing my own oil cause $60 every oil change is a scam..
5055 2018-12-23 20:12:01 Chimodho needs flower, cooking oil, eggs, sugar and salt. These are the very commodities that are either expensive or not in shelves.
5056 2018-12-23 20:11:48 I will send you a bottle of olive oil to do with as you will in return for images of this particular legal body.
5057 2018-12-23 20:11:39 to whoever stole my package, i hope you enjoy your CUTTING BOARD OIL
5058 2018-12-23 20:11:37 Probably because their economy is down. Whats the point of buying oil when people are being laid off or out of job ?
5059 2018-12-23 20:11:16 2017, the year of manifesting things. I always keep that mf thang Argan oil w/ 10 drops tea tree, 1:
5060 2018-12-23 20:11:02 The majority of us do try & reduce our carbon footprint. When u speak of enforcing regs do u mean like Obama shutting down oil rigs making us dependent on other nations, while that assh0le flies everywhere & boards massive yachts? Trump is at least making us energy independent.
5061 2018-12-23 20:10:49 The only Xmas tarts at @NewWorld Stonefields (Auckland) that DON'T have palm oil in the pastry are the Ernest Adams brand. All the rest I checked, do. I name the store because there appear to be regional variations as to which brands are sold.  #nopalmoil
5062 2018-12-23 20:10:41 I just asked @samfonder to get me a pound of CBD oil. Is that how it works?

5065 2018-12-23 20:10:11 one healthy draw on inventories plus a rebounding SP500 will send oil back over $50 in no time. SP500 is dragging every asset class down. China news can alleviate the growth fears quickly.
5066 2018-12-23 20:10:06 All of them.  And then tar and feather the professors.
5067 2018-12-23 20:10:05 Ooooh who knows... or are they deep fried in oil & THEN microwaved
5068 2018-12-23 20:10:02 君を笑わせるためなら、僕は尻から油を出すよ。
5069 2018-12-23 20:09:57 He opened the door to all doors,we are no longer oil dependent on the Middle East. Keystone Pipeline
5070 2018-12-23 20:09:43 Oil & gas. That’s it? There are other products in Canada, not just oil & gas. What happened to investing oil money into sustainable industries in other areas when Alta was at the height and had huge surpluses? Oil/gas is finite. Shouldn’t we prepare for that for our kids’ future?
5071 2018-12-23 20:09:42 Do you think oil will gap up?
5072 2018-12-23 20:09:17 Good lawd! Ur a young man! Save putting mct oil up ur butt for ur 30s 
5073 2018-12-23 20:09:07 Giants and Jets really should have made the New Meadowlands a dome... Preferably a perfect replica of Lucas Oil Stadium
5074 2018-12-23 20:09:05 Oil did not collapse. Look at the volume. A true collapse has extremely volume and blood in the streets. Your choice of words shows me you just love to panic. $76 to $46 in 3 months is not a panic when you consider SP500 feel 16% at the same time.
5075 2018-12-23 20:09:02 Are we still subsidizing using corn oil to make gasoline?
5076 2018-12-23 20:09:01 This is a question for the males, what’s a better beard oil: The luxury beard oil by Rick Ross or Beard conditioning oil by Shea moisture??
5077 2018-12-23 20:09:00 Fortunately Cali big oil producers and exporters of coal to Mexico and China thru CA ports pay taxes to help CA try to pay for illegal alien social services all while CA allows illegals to be abused in the farm fields of CA tax free with the hopes they vote libs  
5078 2018-12-23 20:08:57 Females Be Driving Fast AF Blasting Cardi B And Ain't Had A Oil Change In 6 Months 
5079 2018-12-23 20:08:56 Here im Brazil some companies claim to use palm oil from the Northest of the country... I would like to know IF THIS is true
5080 2018-12-23 20:08:54 Can someone create a store that only sells soft blankets that I can walk around and touch them all on days I need a little pick-me-up? Maybe add in some essential oil sniffing?
5081 2018-12-23 20:08:45 @JBelmo when do you resurface your bowling balls because all mine are filled with oil. And when you do resurface them do you do it by hand or with a ball resurfacer.
5082 2018-12-23 20:08:44 Observação interessante da equipe de transmissão da CBS: essa será a última vez que um Manning jogará no Lucas Oil Stadium
5083 2018-12-23 20:08:41 Look, she has been good to me, hooked me up with info on Olbas oil and has paid attention when I have had a bad day. She is good in my book, but I do reserve the right to tease LOL
5084 2018-12-23 20:08:37 Why does Nutella have palm oil in it¿?
5085 2018-12-23 20:08:11 Trump just found out that the Kurds are cozying up to Iran, the Shiites and Assad. Now Kurds are selling oil-and-gas to Assad. That really pissed off Donald Trump and that's why he's going to withdraw troops from Syria in April. The truth is coming out.
5086 2018-12-23 20:08:00 They can all sit around the flickering light of the rendered body oil lamps, while they feast on her lightly sauteed parts, and give many thanks for her preparedness.
5087 2018-12-23 20:07:50 Coconut oil sis!! It helps so much.
5088 2018-12-23 20:07:37 If the Colts can't beat the pathetic Giants -- who don't even have Odell Beckham today -- at Lucas Oil, they don't deserve to make the playoffs.
5089 2018-12-23 20:07:37 Why do you think they are shitting bricks with the trade war. It’s 40% of GDP in China. Non-NAFTA foreign trade not involving oil is less than 5% in USA.
5090 2018-12-23 20:07:33 I knew it. Syria’s just trying to get their oil fields back.
5091 2018-12-23 20:07:32 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
5092 2018-12-23 20:07:29 They don't have a government that is practically a wholly-owned subsidiary to Big Oil, or appear compromised by the next two biggest oil exporters; Russia and Saudi's.
5093 2018-12-23 20:07:14 I hope not....But everyone else disagrees as you can look at the charts and oil simply had a collapse last week. And clearly everyone is challenging OPEC. It may take months for these cuts to affect the price.
5094 2018-12-23 20:07:09 These people are so proud of their Saudi oil. I guess they just love OPEC that much
5095 2018-12-23 20:07:08 Cross is part of Alberta’s Coat of Arms. The idea of separation is moronic and will never ever happen!  How would Alberta’s situation improve? They would remain land locked with only one customer for their tar sands oil. What do they teach in schools nowadays? People are so dumb!
5096 2018-12-23 20:07:02 Render it and use it to fry potatoes. It's the best. Remember when McDonalds fries were so good. Before they were wrongly shamed into switching to vegetable oil they were fried in beef tallow.
5097 2018-12-23 20:06:59 Does Eli have part ownership of Lucas Oil Stadium? It certainly appears that way. 
5098 2018-12-23 20:06:58 Lucas Oil Stadium is ELI Manning’s House! #NYGvsIND #Giants 
5099 2018-12-23 20:06:57 “Take some CPT oil and calm down.” A noble effort, mom.
5100 2018-12-23 20:06:53 Briefly sauté rice in oil, in a big frying pan. Add water to cover. Cook, topping up water as needed, for about 20 mins. Halfway through, add a tin of tuna. Near the end, stir through a generous spoonful of Marmite. Then crack an egg into it and stir that in too. Done.
5101 2018-12-23 20:06:53 Letme go watch This Christmas and watch that fool slide on some baby oil
5102 2018-12-23 20:06:52 I got a question for you. And no, I don't sell it. Lol. But have you tried CBD oil? I hate the supplement industry and "alternative medicine" woo so I was extremely skeptical. I'm waiting to see what happens long term but at this point it seems to be helping a lot to my amazement
5103 2018-12-23 20:06:46 Traffic on N1 in the direction of spintex road around tullow oil. Find alternative route
#HeavyTrafficGh
5104 2018-12-23 20:06:44 It depends. Maybe your favorite president is someone who trades blood for oil like before. You sure wouldnt be a hero of mine, nor the bloodthirsty liberal politicians who want innocent families, women and children to suffer.
5105 2018-12-23 20:06:31 motor oil isnt for drinking
5106 2018-12-23 20:06:28 It's okay... I was going with the recycled oil being constantly repumped over it all.
5107 2018-12-23 20:06:21 クラウンのオイルが減ってる……

ってレベル…
5108 2018-12-23 20:06:19 WWI. Saudi Arabia was part of the Ottoman Empire(Turks) until their defeat as part of the Central Powers during WWI. The British knew of the Arabian Peninsula's potential for oil production since the early 1920's. Oil was discovered in Bahrain in 1932 & in Saudi Arabia in 1938.
5109 2018-12-23 20:06:14 Anybody use CBD oil??
5110 2018-12-23 20:05:59 Is it as simple as The Keystone Pipeline. As we are now oil efficient ,and exporting for the first time in 70 years. OB shut it down. Isn't that the ultimate goal. Follow the money .and how they used Oil as blackmail?

5114 2018-12-23 20:05:34 Sounds good to me.  Let China fight the wars in the middle east and then deal with terrorists afterwards, if they want oil.
5115 2018-12-23 20:05:26 Snake oil adds

5119 2018-12-23 20:05:05 Eli Manning sendo feliz no Lucas Oil since 2012
5120 2018-12-23 20:05:03 Yes 
But mis-pricing is not a subsidy
Coal, oil  and gas don't get financial aid from the government
They pay taxes and have product people will willingly pay for
5121 2018-12-23 20:05:01 I don't need a history lesson in what oil did. Anyone can look at a chart to see oil fell. Oil isn't heading to $26 like 2016. Not even close. OPEC is talking today already about increasing cuts. They can all increase farther in a blink of an eye. Shale can cut fast too.
5122 2018-12-23 20:04:55 Funny thing - if Alberta had stuck-with vs. killed-off the NEP - then Canadian owned company's would have been selling oil sands product to Canada's east coast & to world markets for decades already & Alberta would have an ample heritage fund as well.

5123 2018-12-23 20:04:51 @KBowen1070 can you write a column about how bad and quiet and soft our fan base is at Lucas oil. ALWAYS quiet these days. Barely a home field advantage.

5125 2018-12-23 20:04:39 It’s too late for PDP to talk about taking a holistic look at SMEs. They had 16 years to do that but didn’t. We need a president who has the liver to stop paying 60% of taxes to service debt and to properly monitor how much Oil is being lifted from Nigeria.
5126 2018-12-23 20:04:09 1 oz. melted coconut oil + 5-6 drops of an essential oil = beard balm that's basically free if you already have the ingredients and still cheap if you don't.

5130 2018-12-23 20:04:00 Why does the U.S. continue to import oil from Saudi Arabia while simultaneously exporting oil?
5131 2018-12-23 20:03:55 Yes but what is going on in the middleeast is beyond his control, America only has 2000 troops there, better get out now before stuff really goes down and they have to send more in, 2000 American troops is not gonna stop Russia Iran and Turkey from moving into Syria for the oil
5132 2018-12-23 20:03:48 I know that grandparents really love giving actual presents but I’d be much more grateful for $10 than an essential oil diffuser
5133 2018-12-23 20:03:48 Rubbish England has relied on Ireland for food since before the 1840 genocide,when it continued to transport huge quantities of food out Ireland despite people starving here (2 million died).Scotland Oil has been plundered off them in recent times.
5134 2018-12-23 20:03:44 The cart the Bills use to take players to locker room is gonna need an oil change soon.
5135 2018-12-23 20:03:44 Sorry. On behalf of my Jewish dad, my Jewish grandparents, and all my Jewish friends & relations, I call out nasty anti Semitism when I see it.  I support pipelines. I support Alberta. I don’t support hateful scapegoating. How does such nonsense get Alberta oil to China?
5136 2018-12-23 20:03:35 *Oil joke*
5137 2018-12-23 20:02:34 I have the unpopular opinion that Morrison and Marvel are like water and oil. Lots of rough art in that run doesn’t help either, sadly.
5138 2018-12-23 20:02:31 I’m talking of the poll that 60 per cent of Quebecers are in favour of western Canadian oil rather than the 80,000 barrels of oil that our disgraceful PM allows to pour in
5139 2018-12-23 20:02:15 I love this soil,

5140 2018-12-23 20:02:12 The same set who think oil field protesters are racists. Sad
5141 2018-12-23 20:02:03 The market disagrees with you as oil is pretty much collapsing...Brent alone fell about USD 7 last week. Talk about an implosion. At this rate we will be at USD 25 oil in less than two months.
5142 2018-12-23 20:02:01 NYX comes in clutch with certain products man. I've purchased 6 pans of that powder foundation.  also the matte setting spray helps.
You'll win the battle against the oil.
5143 2018-12-23 20:01:59 65% of oil consumption is for personal vehicles. The mother of all gluts is on the horizon, and you have to be an utter fool to rely on it as a revenue source after what we saw just a few years ago.
5144 2018-12-23 20:01:53 They have GLUT because we do NOT buy their oil or buy our oil back at a higher price!
5145 2018-12-23 20:01:53 Oil is one of the last so-called refuges for the manly man.
5146 2018-12-23 20:01:43 It wasn't specious. Beto took several large donations from oil company execs after pledging that he wouldn't. @OilChangeUS took him off of their candadates-pledge list because of that reporting.
5147 2018-12-23 20:01:32 Make law to unprivatize public utility and make law banning buy and sell of natural resources such as oil, water, forest land.
5148 2018-12-23 20:01:02 LOL, LOL, LOL! How will they export their tar sands oil? They would be still land locked only now it would be in@Canada’s interest to make them suffer.  It will never Ever happen. It’s ignorant to think otherwise.  It’s moronic!
5149 2018-12-23 20:00:59 Nkongnist Philosophies: On the Future of Africa
The greatest assets of the Afrika of the future is the mind of the teenagers of today.
I pray that our African leaders consider that generation and the content of their mind as a natural resource more important than oil & gold.
5150 2018-12-23 20:00:56 Because you know what Tennessee is famous for...oil
5151 2018-12-23 20:00:43 Aye, if Scotland didn't have oil or whisky, we'd have been independent years ago. Sad truth.

5156 2018-12-23 20:00:20 Have you tried cbd oil I’ve heard it helps with add and adhd I’m trying to get off my adderal and want to try it I’ve talked to so many people who have it and made the switch
5157 2018-12-23 20:00:13 I've been hearing about this from tech friends for years. If you keep it lubricated you can clock a processor to go way above capacity. Hence why a fishtank if baby oil is a must for big calculations.
5158 2018-12-23 20:00:12 Nobody believes KSA can pump 12Mbpd for long if at all. They had to pull oil out of storage just to hit 11Mbpd. You can't trust the data on their fields either. Likely way overstated by them. KSA is weaker than most think. Need higher price just to pay the bills.

5163 2018-12-23 19:59:33 Question for everyone that lives in #SouthernCalifornia... How do you make friends in person when you have seizures? How do we get everyone to stop judging us adult men from still not driving, going to school or working (yet)? BUT have the seizures under control with the CBD Oil?
5164 2018-12-23 19:59:29 Solar isn't as cheap as oil. That's obviously a lie. Thank you for pointing that out. 

Solar is CHEAPER than oil.
5165 2018-12-23 19:59:18 The beard oil no work ni?
5166 2018-12-23 19:59:15 Me with a lot of people is like oil and water
5167 2018-12-23 19:59:05 And you keep bring up local subsidies for oil without addressing the fact we buy oil that is already subsidized
5168 2018-12-23 19:59:00 @NGRPresident PLEASE SAI BABA, CONTINUE WITH THE GOOD WORK YOU ARE DOING. DO NOT ALLOW ALL THESE SO-CALLED GENERALS WHO HAD BEEN CONTROLLING OIL BLOCKS WHICH HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM THEM FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE MASSES DISTRACT YOU. GOD WILL SHOW THEM WHO HAS POWER
5169 2018-12-23 19:58:58 The oil tho 
5170 2018-12-23 19:58:54 So how are we doing on the oil and gas consumption for the holidays, folks? Going to stay home or are you planning on traveling either by car or by air? Staying home is good for keeping your carbon footprint low.
5171 2018-12-23 19:58:47 As an Albertan I recognize the need for oil but I'm also shocked, disappointed, embarrassed, ashamed & disgusted at the way so many Albertans including right wing politicians are responding with selfish hate driven messages & attacks. It's time to drop the anger & mature.
5172 2018-12-23 19:58:47 Have you tried cbd oil
5173 2018-12-23 19:58:43 The lacquered layers of childhood. Mine was my grandad smelling of compost, machine oil and mints.
5174 2018-12-23 19:58:33 So.... CBD oil in coffee is a thing now??? saw it on menu at local cafe. who's tried it? How did you feel? I saw someone describe it as "It was as if someone spiked my latte with teeny tiny bits of Xanax," which would be my literal dream come true.... should i try it?!
5175 2018-12-23 19:58:26 @philvickerytv saw you saying about cooking roast potatoes fully , then reheating for about 20 minutes . I’m having a nightmare Christmas with family illness so need to make Christmas dinner as easy as possible! Do I reheat the potatoes in hot oil again ?? HELP!
5176 2018-12-23 19:58:17 if you get tea tree oil on that bitch 3x a day for a fortnight it will drop right off.

5178 2018-12-23 19:58:09 "The difference between a wick that is lit and consumed, lit and burns out or lit and continues to shine peacefully and perpetually is how saturated it is with the oil. Let yourself become saturated with the Holy Spirit so you can shine." @AnbaThomas @CMANAmerica #CMANARMOR

I've heard it all, none are valid. 
Fact is they just hate Trump.
5185 2018-12-23 19:57:03 And like I stated, many countries such as the US buys lots of oil that is essentially 100% subsidized.
5186 2018-12-23 19:57:01 Buy an essential oils kit! It comes with peppermint oil and all other kinds that are so helpful for your health.
5187 2018-12-23 19:56:45 It’s hard when you have a liberal government destroying industry mainly oil and gas in Canada. It sends the wrong message. While we have this liberal government we are definitely not open for business.
5188 2018-12-23 19:56:42 If gas and oil companies aren't making the money, it means consumers are saving money. It's not an either or. Plus, alternatives are the future. Hybrid cars,solar panels and wind turbines are now mainstream where they were a pipedream 20 years ago.
5189 2018-12-23 19:56:40 Yorkshire people will be busting a blood vessel with no gravy in that list.
As for sprouts. I roast mine after par simmering them.
I double roast my parsnips after par boiling then. I use olive oil (not extra virgin as too tart) & fresh rosemary.
Same with the potatoes n carrots
5190 2018-12-23 19:56:38 Oh goodness. He might as well give you castor oil. 
5191 2018-12-23 19:56:28 Sometimes a little roasting goes a long way. Went to a party when I was just out of college and a woman touched my beard (which, like—don’t touch me). But she said, “Baby, gotta put some oil in that.” 

I’ve never been caught out here lacking since.
5192 2018-12-23 19:56:13 The honourable minister is talking about the size of the budget.we trade our crude oil in dollars. There is no difference btw 8 trillion naira in 2018 and 4 trillion in 2014. Dollar was 186 and now 365.thata double and that's why the budget is double.
5193 2018-12-23 19:56:05 nor is he an inventor. 

he is a classic snake oil salesman.
5194 2018-12-23 19:56:00 Uhhmmm, world demand for oil is going up EVERY year, can't see any buggy whips. Be an adult and try to read and understand things
5195 2018-12-23 19:55:56 If you have access to CBD/THC oil please look into it.
5196 2018-12-23 19:55:45 Let’s hope this mix of vitamins, greens, collagen, protein, and castor oil will help my hair 
5197 2018-12-23 19:55:20 Bad polices didn't help but when oil prices crash so bad that the Saudis nearly get wiped out, it's fair to say oil prices played a big factor.

5200 2018-12-23 19:54:56 Similar in taste. But, they are small pumpkins about the size of a honeydew or cantaloupe melon. Thin skin and thick flesh. Wonderful when baked. They can take a savory or sweet treatment. I use them for both. Sometimes I just rub them down with olive oil and rosemary and roast.

5207 2018-12-23 19:54:24 what exactly did the American citizens gain from the governments post 9/11 policy? the opportunity to buy more oil? the complete loss of privacy? soldiers permanently posted up in Penn Station? taking shoes off at the airport? a permanent military presence in the middle east?
5208 2018-12-23 19:54:24 Global oil prices fell near 1% on Friday. Brent crude fell by US53 cents or 1.0% to US$53.82 a barrel and the US Nymex price fell by US29 cents or 0.6% to US$45.59 a barrel. Over the week Brent fell US$6.46 or 10.7% with Nymex down US$5.61 or 11%. #ausbiz

5239 2018-12-23 19:50:37 The main argument over Beto I heard was that he “broke his pledge” not to collect more than $200 from oil “execs”. Like 13 times? My answer, stupid pledge. Stop corporate money, and from the very wealthy. But they don’t donate to Beto. Stupid pledges are purity traps.
5240 2018-12-23 19:50:35 So strap yourself with an Ak47 let you go. Fight your own war. Let you settle it that way.. Blood for oil.
One guy once said that ummm
5241 2018-12-23 19:50:32 I always find it odd when oil people complain like this. You KNOW oil busts and yet you never plan for it. Your anger is misdirected. Maybe previous governments should have diversified our jobs and helped retrain workers for different prospects.
5242 2018-12-23 19:50:19 The Syrian civilians like Assad and legally voted him in. Look up Syrian girl and others on YouTube. Obama and the Dems funded ISIS to try and topple Assad to access pipelines and OIL. Google the facts and stop promulgating propaganda you silly billy
5243 2018-12-23 19:50:16 I’m sorry but why are we in Syria again? Did the Senate approve this? We were is Iraq bc of a war Bush raged for oil & popularity. You can’t compare Iraq to Syria.

5256 2018-12-23 19:48:43 Foreign policy is a mess, many of us want out of oil, Alberta doesnt want to, northern ontario is in shambles, opioid crisis from coast to coast.

You need to step up your game and think about the people... and fast.
5257 2018-12-23 19:48:42 I'm bringing it up only because bulls keep talking about how subsidized the "oil legacies" are, without ever mentioning that taxes derived from said legacies are far bigger.

I'm not a fan of subsidies, but of free market forces. BEVs would die instantly... Sustainable future.
5258 2018-12-23 19:48:42 I want to try this CBD oil stuff, but I don't want to risk my career over it. We have random drug tests, & if it shows at all, then I can't use it. I hear a lot of great things about it…
5259 2018-12-23 19:48:34 we leave pans with oil just about anywhere so we can reuse it
5260 2018-12-23 19:48:03 Finish on cast iron with avocado or grapeseed oil. Higher smoke point.
5261 2018-12-23 19:48:00 Just heard someone in the hallway say “You’ve never eaten anything with truffle oil in it!?” In a shocked/exasperated voice.
That’s our area officially gentrified.
5262 2018-12-23 19:47:57 Maybe just a grease & oil change as I am Vintage & Heritage Listed.
5263 2018-12-23 19:47:44 Just look how well that worked for Hillary. Just heard that Hickenlooper is "pragmatic". Practicality demands that we die together in this prison colony from morbidly rich oil pig hot air.
5264 2018-12-23 19:47:34 *smacks lips several times*

mmm yess... this CBD oil pairs nicely with the adderall
5265 2018-12-23 19:47:29 Coal oil???
5266 2018-12-23 19:47:25 She doesn't buy locally. She bans Canadian oil and gas but imports from wherever else.
5267 2018-12-23 19:47:12 Anyone else’s family leave pans full of used cooking oil in the oven to reuse later
5268 2018-12-23 19:47:06 Already said it but this will be #1 deflection, even though the biggest donors employed by Big Oil are execs and it doesn't address whether O'Rourke will be over friendly to fossil fuels!
5269 2018-12-23 19:47:03 Please, ask the minister why the federal government hasn't thought it wise to build federal housing scheme in most of the oil rich states where the government has benefited emensely in terms of the oil generated which the whole of the country is relying to grow its economy?
5270 2018-12-23 19:47:02 People build mineral oil cooled computers in fish tanks?!?!??! I love the internet.
5271 2018-12-23 19:46:53 That wouldn’t have stopped the oil crash and if the corporations were corrupt, then what?
5272 2018-12-23 19:46:29 The only Countries who adhere to the Paris targets are those that are not oil producers! The 7 Sisters are progressing: instead of killing somebody (Enrico Mattei -ENI), they now use false statements and politics!
5273 2018-12-23 19:46:26 no ppl is perfect for now , its stable , buy and forget any oil and gas
5274 2018-12-23 19:46:21 lettuce bone marrow. . .16
buttermilk olive oil and sweet & sour chestnut. . .9
scallion chow fun and truffle cheddar chicken wings. . .11
chestnut. . .25
5275 2018-12-23 19:46:20 We have been following the same Foreign Policies in the Middle East since the 70’s, doing the same thing over & over and expecting different results!
Are we safer today than in the 70’s?
With the U.S. current oil supply secure we have nothing to gain by our War Policies.
5276 2018-12-23 19:46:18 Did you see Prof Kate Williams' response to it - there was no anointing oil!
5277 2018-12-23 19:46:10 Check your Engine oil today.
5278 2018-12-23 19:45:59 Yes it is. Saudis paid M-E war effort. Its about knocking your competitors out of business. Secretary Zinke said it. We should use the navy to block russian oil exports to europe.
Its not a coincidence. Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran. All oil producers not in cahoots with Washington
5279 2018-12-23 19:45:52 @GrouponHelpUS I I am contacting you because I purchased a Groupon for Valvoline synthetic oil change went to the location in Lancaster Pennsylvania and they would not except the Groupon I would like a full refund on this Groupon very dissatisfied
5280 2018-12-23 19:45:43 As usual, Oil and Gas is very tricky game. 
5281 2018-12-23 19:45:41 That’s what I’m using, the organic coconut oil
5282 2018-12-23 19:45:40 Trump probably helped arrange this. He probably thought, "Well, if it helps keep the price of oil down... what are friends for?"
5283 2018-12-23 19:45:23 OMG. Aren't you a dear? That claptrap about how capitalism "respects liberty and rights" falls by the wayside when countries with lots of oil democratically elect socialist leaders. Then we impose economic sanctions on them, cripple their economy, and blame it all on socialism.
5284 2018-12-23 19:45:10 When in doubt, put chili oil in it.
5285 2018-12-23 19:44:57 幸子彼氏は居ないけどお亀ちゃんが2匹いるわよ(￣･ω･￣)
5286 2018-12-23 19:44:51 Tbf I don't disagree with that but avo on toast with salt and decent olive oil and chili is amazing. And guac is a burrito requirement.
5287 2018-12-23 19:44:50 It isn't snake oil. Russia as a #Capitalist #Oligarchy is a far worse foe than Russia as a Communist dictatorship. #Putin learned much from his puppet and then decided to become its master. You might call #Vlady a corporate raider of the lost ark. I see the two as mirror images.
5288 2018-12-23 19:44:35 I have to depart with you here. We can’t leave our allies here or let Putin rule the worlds supply of oil.
5289 2018-12-23 19:44:34 Yes, I will cook'em in olive oil, garlic, parsley and some chile de arbol and mix with pasta
5290 2018-12-23 19:44:31 cooking with my mom is funny bc i’m used to cooking for 300 versus her cooking for 4 and apparently i use too much olive oil
5291 2018-12-23 19:44:29 Love This Question Family !!!
Why ??? Is It Now Legal ???
Can We All Do Invasions Now & Take The Oil Anywhere ???
5292 2018-12-23 19:44:26 I JUST GOT THIS SET AND BROKE A NAIL CHECKING MY OIL; I CANT BE INDEPENDENT AND A WOMAN?????
5293 2018-12-23 19:44:21 Keep telling yourself that every time you use #automobiles, #electronics, #televisions, #computers, #mobilephones, #LCDs, #oil and #oilproducts, #silver, #fruits, #vegetables, #coffee, #cotton.
5294 2018-12-23 19:44:01 I agree that mid-east oil is no longer a strategic interest to the US.

I would like the US to continue train and support where that can help, but not take the combat mission. Israel needs our support, but we don't have to fight for them.
5295 2018-12-23 19:43:59 i switched from in shower body lotions to baby oil and i don’t regret it my skin is like SOFT soft
5296 2018-12-23 19:43:58 He has no chance of winning.  

He is married to a billionaires daughter, he voted for Trumps bloated military bill and was caught lying about taking oil money.

He is a disgusting phony, just like Obama and Clinton.
5297 2018-12-23 19:43:49 Thanks for helping me reach 25 followers! I sell pure coconut oil...it has amazing benefits and is available in different sizes, pls like and retweet our pinned tweet @DelightOil and @ladydelight93  Thanks
5298 2018-12-23 19:43:46 @GrouponHelpUS Hi I Purchased a Groupon for Valvoline synthetic oil change went to the Location Columbia Ave., Lancaster PA and they would not except the Groupon I am reaching out to you because I would like a full refund.
5299 2018-12-23 19:43:43 My baby always act right when I get her oil changed 
5300 2018-12-23 19:43:43 Shit had me ready to bring out the baby oil gel 
5301 2018-12-23 19:43:41 It took us younger voters years to get Beto to deregulate banks, push oil & gas, shun #M4A and continually give Trump whatever military budget he wants.

We’re not letting go of him after all that work.
5302 2018-12-23 19:43:28 Slip in some CBD oil. Then, everything pans out
5303 2018-12-23 19:43:21 My wife can’t smell my oil vape pen in the next room. :) Time to sneak in the gel caps and oil cartridges. Seriously though with clinical studies underway the medical establishment will be forced to acquiesce.
5304 2018-12-23 19:43:18 All bought and paid for by Koch.  Look into them, they do not care about laws or the safety of anyone, just oil
5305 2018-12-23 19:43:16 Abeg dey where you dey with your black oil
5306 2018-12-23 19:43:12 Have you read that article from The Guardian? Or the research on it?

You're having a straw man argument with me. I'm not even doubting that oil and gas are heavily taxed at the customer level, so I'm not sure why you keep bringing that up...
5307 2018-12-23 19:42:41 To busywhring fir Russia Givin Syria to Russia who cannot compete with cheap oil markets TRAITOR
5308 2018-12-23 19:42:32 Shoutout my sister for putting me into olive oil as a deep conditioner my hair comes out silky smooth everytime
5309 2018-12-23 19:42:23 ขอบคุณทุกคนน
5310 2018-12-23 19:42:21 I could see a baby 2014-16 investment cycle due to the oil drop and the housing cost issues. Pretty minor stuff overall though.
5311 2018-12-23 19:42:19 y’all niggas scared to moisturize y’all skin but I step fresh out the shower and apply organic coconut oil and aloe vera 
5312 2018-12-23 19:42:15 next time that happens use coconut oil to get it out u dumb bitch
5313 2018-12-23 19:41:58 Sex is a good idea to have a single chin and the cod liver oil and gas industry and the first thing you did was walk around

...What
5314 2018-12-23 19:41:55 I'll try thanks! I always dread that little tickle in my throat I know it's gonna get worse and it's probably already too late. I've been drinking green tea and using olbas oil
5315 2018-12-23 19:41:53 Sure, but also Canada Post. Canada Post aren’t saving lives and neither are oil field workers and they all should rev paid like they AREN’T.
5316 2018-12-23 19:41:47 sana oil
5317 2018-12-23 19:41:45 The oil of joy instead of mourning. AMEN 
5318 2018-12-23 19:41:44 Coal oil? Haven't heard of that dad yet 
5319 2018-12-23 19:41:33 #AmericaFirst is good for the world. In terms of trade, security, leadership, if America was 2nd or 3rd? Is our current policy sustainable in blood/treasure in addition to calls for universal health, general social/domestic allocation of resources? Prob not.
5320 2018-12-23 19:41:24 He said "Be courageous, the God who provided the yam will also provide oil to eat it."
5321 2018-12-23 19:41:20 Everyone's going on about palm oil being really bad but it's not my fault I get sweaty hands #croissant
5322 2018-12-23 19:40:57 Italian seasoning-> italian herb, usually McCormick grinder one lol. Usually use olive oil for baking. Cover it first with aluminum foil during baking, & then broil for bronze look & crispy texture. It usually depends how much chicken you have for the cooking time 
5323 2018-12-23 19:40:56 You should save the oil sands....for Jesus.
5324 2018-12-23 19:40:54 Headline probably will drop a bit further thanks to low oil prices.
5325 2018-12-23 19:40:50 LRT: I’ve only oil painted once and I didn’t follow some of these instructions (and neither did my classmates, someone left a jar of turpentine open for a period of time). Please please PLEASE be careful when using these materials
5326 2018-12-23 19:40:40 Oil paint? Cool
5327 2018-12-23 19:40:31 Thanks jare lemme follow @miss_aykay you will help a lot in the future
5328 2018-12-23 19:40:31 $100/bbl of oil for at least half a decade...@tundefashola
5329 2018-12-23 19:40:30 I have so many but my favorites are clear quartz and rose quartz. Just got some amethyst and I'm so excited to see how it treats me. 

I like lemon oil because its associated with cleansing the aura, it being in my sheets means that happens once a day, everyday for 2 weeks.
5330 2018-12-23 19:40:27 In da gaske yana tsoron Allah ya kyaleta tayi zaman auren ta kada ya sake nemanta!! Ya roqi Allah zai bashi wadda ta fita
5331 2018-12-23 19:40:24 Very good of her, they would have even given you olive oil to drink sef
5332 2018-12-23 19:40:17 Miscellar water can also dry out your face so be careful not to over cleanse either! Using natural ingredients to cleanse your face would be ideal and then using a face oil or light moisturiser would be better :)
5333 2018-12-23 19:40:08 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
5334 2018-12-23 19:40:01 like Beto’s oil/gas $, how much of Booker’s pharma $ is small donations from ppl who work for them
5335 2018-12-23 19:40:00 Without #fracking, the oil and gas industry would not exist in New Mexico. It’s essential that fracking remain in our state for the vital state funding that it brings.
5336 2018-12-23 19:39:41 Gronk is leaking oil...bad.
5337 2018-12-23 19:39:31 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!
5338 2018-12-23 19:39:31 Brushed with oil sea salt and pepper
5339 2018-12-23 19:39:31 We only heat it in the woks with vegetable oil
5340 2018-12-23 19:39:27 I put a bunch of vegetables in the biggest pan I own with a bunch of herbs and spices and Szechuan sauce and sesame oil and it's delicious and that's where I am in my life.
5341 2018-12-23 19:39:22 @sairashahhalim

Why cant you even spend even Rs 30-50 on a egg breakfast ? Spend less on the sh*tty lotion/powder for face and spend on food. Will make u happy

Madam, the day middle-east oil dries out or no longer needed, you will start asking for vegetables. Remember my words
5342 2018-12-23 19:39:17 that would be true if this were anything other than a gesture to his base. There're something like 40,000 US troops stationed throughout the middle east. They are there to ensure that access to oil is not interrupted. This announcement changes none of that.
5343 2018-12-23 19:39:12 1-3 drops of Peppermint Oil in your bong water.

You're welcome.
5344 2018-12-23 19:39:06 Ah, the oil, yeah. I’ve got one flakey patch but it’s much reduced with the H&S. Works eventually! On that Australian shampoo now. Smells great
5345 2018-12-23 19:39:03 Just one drop of the glistening oil can eventually stain even a soul as stalwart as a loxodon's beyond redemption.　《Loxodon Convert》[NPH]
5346 2018-12-23 19:39:00 Need either stuffing or mashed potatoes or both to sop up gravy. We usually do braided red cabbage and roasted brussel sprouts. Both super easy. Latter just needs to be cut in half, salt, pepper, oil, touch of maple syrup and popped in oven to roast.
5347 2018-12-23 19:38:59 I've heard great things about cbd oil for dogs suffering from anxiety, seizures, cancer etc. basically just like humans! 
5348 2018-12-23 19:38:59 A trump fan made laugh out loud, usually I just shake my head at their silliness.
Diane- besides math, you don't recognize a snake oil salesman that most teenagers can see.
To divert from investigations, he's got you disagreeing with facts that engineers have told us for decades.

5350 2018-12-23 19:38:41 I meant red oil
5351 2018-12-23 19:38:35 Bath time w/ @fatbellybella top hits on @iTunes with tea tree and peppermint oil. #relaxation ...
5352 2018-12-23 19:38:24 Those greens will taste like olive oil salt pepper sesame seeds and green hay.
5353 2018-12-23 19:38:24 The way the Giants are playing in Lucas Oil Stadium today you would think they won a Super Bowl there or something.
5354 2018-12-23 19:38:22 What shampoo do you guys use? They stopped selling the hask coconut oil shampoo and conditioner I was using and now my family can’t decide which brand to pick up.
5355 2018-12-23 19:38:22 I was literally saying this today to the hubby while we were outside a fishing & hunting shop and he asked that surely worms would make a great present. And I said “Some nice motor oil would go a long way.” 
5356 2018-12-23 19:38:16 Olive oil marche pour les deux. Mais the best pour moi pour plaquer le clear et pour wash n go (je déteste en faire) flax seed
5357 2018-12-23 19:37:59 Oh my God...that sweet feeling after exfoliating ur skin and using a good cream and oil.
I can sleep like a baby and have a fabulous week.
5358 2018-12-23 19:37:58 Old Bay over crab oil all day
5359 2018-12-23 19:37:42 In an era where football is a bigger business than oil and gas, an era where football is the biggest diplomatic instrument. We have an Amaju running the NFF like his pocket business of bread and beans. As we speak there is no accounting for all the money brought in by sponsors.
5360 2018-12-23 19:37:33 dad "you need these" hands me boxes of oil paints around 200ml
me, who never used oils in my life "a"
5361 2018-12-23 19:37:33 Fish. Plantain. Black Oil.
5362 2018-12-23 19:37:31 I did only one project with the oil ink, and I believe I put the waste into a glass pasta sauce jar :x
5363 2018-12-23 19:37:30 My poor baby cat got into some oil or something so I had to give her a bath and now she’s crying under my bed
5364 2018-12-23 19:37:29 Squirrel oil...... 
5365 2018-12-23 19:37:27 A couple days ago I got burned with oil while cooking. However, its Advent IV and we are almost ready for the birth of Jesus, my Lord. Pray for me and also get your ass in Church! Christ-Mass is coming!!
5366 2018-12-23 19:37:27 Oil won't run out in your lifetime and probably not your childrens. New oilfields are being discovered all the time. This year a new field was discovered almost as large as Prudhoe Bay. And who knows what the Chinese are discovering. Russia with the introduction to modern tools.
5367 2018-12-23 19:37:12 ありがとう私のクリスマスガチャ三銃士ガチャだったわ
5368 2018-12-23 19:37:11 Does your quit smoking plan extend to vehicles? I just bought a used pickup truck and I think oil is leaking into the gas tank. 
5369 2018-12-23 19:37:11 I used coconut oil & cocoa butter.
5370 2018-12-23 19:36:54 I'm dancing like crazy to Uyo Meyo by @TeniEntertainer on repeat. Awesome song!  Teni! Your  head shall never lack oil
5371 2018-12-23 19:36:41 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
5372 2018-12-23 19:36:14 Orange oil
5373 2018-12-23 19:36:00 Aw my dad got me a whole kit of oil paint  I’ll be busy as fuck this month.
5374 2018-12-23 19:35:49 It’s that cbd oil vape
5375 2018-12-23 19:35:46 Oil prices are down but my town is still at $4 gal. 
5376 2018-12-23 19:35:32 Baguuuss, make dikit udh mantul bgt, aku make shade 020 di botol keliatan putih bgt, tp pas dipake nyatu banget sm kulit, sebagus ituu pokoknya, oil controlnya jg mayan, ga bakalan nyesel klo beli
5377 2018-12-23 19:35:26 Wow, at this very holy time of year that was about as kindhearted and thoughtful as an oil change.
5378 2018-12-23 19:35:17 You just described the oil field, except wages are much higher.
5379 2018-12-23 19:35:16 There were 4 houses between mine and the North city limits back then, last time I was there many moons ago the limit had moved several miles North of there.Calgary suffers from too many oil company offices.
5380 2018-12-23 19:35:08 Just imagine Sir, imagine the freedom to drive clear across the USA on 20 gallons of tap water, zero oil, zero gas, byway of the Meyer's DIY water-to-hydrogen combustion conversion kit.
#NonstopOilWars, faked inflation, faked recessions/depressions, fake bank bailouts would stop.
5381 2018-12-23 19:35:07 Hey be nice!
I'm further down the table...any lower and I'll be finding oil.
5382 2018-12-23 19:34:55 Obama himself said we should thank him for making the US the world leading oil producer, just a few weeks ago.
5383 2018-12-23 19:34:49 He has no pension from them. They all don’t all get it. I know many well educated CP workers and many uneducated oil workers with much higher wages and much better pensions
5384 2018-12-23 19:34:40 You didn't note that many of the "oil industry" contributions to Beto came from ordinary workers employed by such companies. The article on NBC News noted that
5385 2018-12-23 19:34:23 لا يا ورع 
5386 2018-12-23 19:34:19 Don't say X! They will sharpen their pitchforks and oil up their torches just because they think you aren't celebrating Christmas but Xbox.
5387 2018-12-23 19:34:18 My landlord has done it again! Another Xmas gift of furnace oil. He’s literally the only non trash landlord in history. He legit also LOWERED our rent this year lol
5388 2018-12-23 19:34:16 Aku sih harus pake toner dan face oil baru bisa bobo nyenyak
5389 2018-12-23 19:34:07 So far my on Christmas Vacation in FL my mom has gifted me some CBD oil, dad is currently about to get in the hot tub and start happy hour while mom is napping hungover on the couch.  Who is this young hip family and what did you do with my parents? 
5390 2018-12-23 19:34:04 occult showing Satan is God&God of t bible emits prophecy into t bible so since they believe Satan is God they hint prophecies)&thus by the calling card of their plan to reign on the high seas like global warming is designed to tell occult nations get away fr oil&gas>sink tankers
5391 2018-12-23 19:34:00 I don't remember all that was in it, but olive oil, lemon juice, and two other ingredients was supposed to get rid of gall bladder polyps or something. It worked, but that polyp or whatever it was, obstructed the conduit between my kidney and urinary bladder. The poison backed up
5392 2018-12-23 19:33:54 Same outcome. Sorry, but on this Democrats get zero fucking credit. 

They created an oil boom. They bugged delegates in Copenhagen and sabotaged the conference. They supported a coup against the Brazilian left that has led to fascists threatening the Amazon.

5398 2018-12-23 19:33:16 Whitecourt has changed dramatically. When I last visited, in 2011, it had completely transitioned into forestry. Only oil company that remained, from all I could tell, was Haliburton. It was kind of strange.
5399 2018-12-23 19:33:14 We have legalized weed in Canada. But it's NOT either/or. Canadians have an important resource industry that we need for jobs, AND so we're not dependent on ME oil. 'Alternate energy sources' are still not viable. #TrudeauMustGo #JustinLovesJihad

5402 2018-12-23 19:32:54 You won't challenge the oil companies or make any effort to build wind farms,  hydroelectric plants,  solar farms. You lack the depth and understamding of the free energy production we could have.  The jobs you'd create. Thr Americans you'd be taking care of.  Doing your job.

Let's see how happy Putin is about the withdrawal, about his plans for the oil pipeline.
Let's see how happy theexiled Syrians are.
Let's see how happy Iranian imams are.

5414 2018-12-23 19:31:15 I spaced our on getting my oil changed for WAY too long.  The worst of it was the shameful looks I got from the guys at the shop.
5415 2018-12-23 19:31:07 So back to the middle east:

Trump's announced withdrawal (and that's all it is so far, an announcement) may be good for the people stationed in Syria, but that is a far cry from it being a genuine act of peace, or a change in fundamental US mideast policy to keep the oil.
5416 2018-12-23 19:30:59 President Trump is the long term strategic thinker here.  Middle East oil is becoming less important to the USA.  Previous administrations have spent trillions there for what?
5417 2018-12-23 19:30:56 The snake oil salesmen had something people wanted to buy.
5418 2018-12-23 19:30:49 For folks who for whatever reason don't like long-boiled vegetables, you can get good results by cutting them in long strips and stir-frying them in a good bit of oil, but if you do that, that oil better be really, really hot and you better leave them in there a good bit.

 Very relaxing.
5422 2018-12-23 19:30:12 @Jacob_Rees_Mogg mentioning snake oil? Surely not....
5423 2018-12-23 19:30:11 Every 2 weeks ! & I use black castor oil , you tried that?
5424 2018-12-23 19:30:08 I like getting my oil changed at Valvoline because I don’t have to let some stranger get in my car and judge me for the amount of crap in it
5425 2018-12-23 19:30:07 I didn’t miss it, you are wrong. I can pull twenty job postings right now with starting wages higher than them. Any oil field labourer makes more, most couriers, and many other jobs. Particularly in Alberta.

5429 2018-12-23 19:29:31 Venezuela's navy "intercepted" a ship exploring for oil on behalf  of Exxon Mobil Corp  in Guyanese waters over the weekend,  neighboring Guyana's foreign ministry said in a statement, while  Venezuela said the incident occurred within its territory.
5430 2018-12-23 19:29:21 In the 1970s we looked ahead and saw less oil, but we were wrong because we lacked knowledge. What was considered rational in the 70s is no longer rational today. Thus rationality itself is a fickle, useless, arbitrary concept.
5431 2018-12-23 19:29:03 Several problems: blanch means they won't be the right consistency, drizzle with olive oil salt and pepper means it wasn't cooked in, sesame seeds I don't even know what purpose they're serving here and last but certainly not least, where is the pork/fatback #NotMyCollards
5432 2018-12-23 19:28:41 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 7 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

5436 2018-12-23 19:27:48 Kale doesn't have as much of the bitter defense chemicals in it as collards do. You can massage kale with oil to the point that it's tasty. I tried this once on collards just out of curiosity and as expected it was bad.

5441 2018-12-23 19:27:28 Also traditionally they only raise rates if there is inflation. Bloomberg reports commodity prices & all way down. Oil 2 yr low. Silver 10 yr. USD strong. IE: no inflation. WSJ commented on this. Fed also warned Trump not to criticize them, which you can guess how that went.
5442 2018-12-23 19:27:17 Humanity constantly strives towards advancment in bettering our daily lives and the lives of the future generations. In this case, the generation in power resists to evolve in this process over greed and power. Excusing them for economic and social stability. Eg. oil industry.
5443 2018-12-23 19:27:13 It's a new age. Islamists not your traditional nation states of past, when defeated accepted defeat. It's a theological ideology that will arise no matter how long we stay. 
Trump is conveying this truth. Once committed it's likely generational.

No one knows how to cut any gears, assemble working engines, or mode of manufacture, it's all broken up like, someone is the crumb, someone is the oil
5447 2018-12-23 19:26:47 I’m sure they said the same thing about oil, but they had the sand to stick with it and ride it out.
5448 2018-12-23 19:26:40 “if i was an oil life percentage i would be in the negative”

5451 2018-12-23 19:26:05 If he's selling his snake oil under the banner of "promises made, promises kept," I think it's fine to point out that they were bad ideas that he was lying about anyway.  It's doubly relevant.

5469 2018-12-23 19:24:13 Btw I agree w/ @JigarShahDC that the “we were ready to decarbonize and didn’t” story is flawed. My take is oil cos initially saw research as a way to influence policy, then decided nah let’s just kill it altogether. It was always about influencing regs, just a shift in tactics.

5472 2018-12-23 19:24:02 Sudan was a rich oil country before the split in 2011. Now South Sudan holds all the oil reserves, and Sudan no longer benefits from its profits
5473 2018-12-23 19:23:58 Sirota claimed that Beto was funded by "big oil". the reality is he was funded by individual small donations from folks that worked for the oil industry (which is a LOT of people in Texas). I really HOPE you can see the dishonesty in that take, because it is dishonest.
5474 2018-12-23 19:23:51 I await the invention of the electric aircraft engine with enough battery power to fly an A380  from UK to Australia. Oil will still be needed in future for all sorts of applications & uses & it's better to be a country with supplies of it than not.
5475 2018-12-23 19:23:45 You mentioned oil companies being your non negotiable so in turn the person you talked to told you people soft on gun control are theirs
5476 2018-12-23 19:23:43 What part of “and I’ll get Mexico to pay for it” is confusing that addled, little brain of yours? We gave all your big money donors a big oil’ tax break. Maybe you can fund this one... pick a corner and shake what your momma gave you and see if you can get some $ that way?

5497 2018-12-23 19:21:17 Lots of people like to point to "my country doesn't have that much subsidies" while correct they ignore that in the major of cases they don't source all their oil locally and often buy from counties that have oil industries which are essentially 100% subsidized

5526 2018-12-23 19:17:47 Kracie naive cleansing oil the best sih dlu banget beli di AEON lg disc jd 35rb woi parah dan mnrt ku lebih bagus itu drpd Biore. Tp sayangnya udh susah bgt dicari
5527 2018-12-23 19:17:46 As I replied to @CanadaLove2019, the Irving’s buy foreign light crude and ship the refined gas mostly south. Some of it is sold in the Maritime provinces but most goes South to the US.
It’s a private company. They own the biggest refinery in Canada. Our govt. does not buy oil.
5528 2018-12-23 19:17:45 man oh man....I was REALLY looking forward to the match-ups this week with Anaheim and the Oil....now the Anaheim game looks to be much tougher with one of our two big guns from the back out. Plus, getting used to & LOVE watching the Erik speed/rushes up the ice
5529 2018-12-23 19:17:34 Then people would use knives, rocks, spears, bricks, hot oil, etc. Naiive is right.
5530 2018-12-23 19:17:32 Westminster doesn’t manage the oil the oil companies do.
5531 2018-12-23 19:17:27 My mom practically forced TWO different kinds of CBD oil down mine and @mmargaretgrace’s throats before 10am today. Merry Christmas to us?

5534 2018-12-23 19:17:25 I hate war, too. A lot. I have learned that war is often about oil, or land, or politics, or gun sales, or allies, or keeping allies, or keeping the bad guys like ISIS in a different country.
5535 2018-12-23 19:17:22 I think you're wrong, on those points. But why @JustinTrudeau  & @RachelNotley are #ThrowingBillions to the oil patch, but not to the #ParisAccord, I do not understand, nor like :(
5536 2018-12-23 19:17:21 I'm gonna puke
5537 2018-12-23 19:17:16 Those types are NOT inclined towards your type. It’s oil and water.
5538 2018-12-23 19:17:15 So many idiots tweeting!! 1st they think using US soldiers lives to protect opium in Afghanistan and oil lines in Syria is worth loosing men and women over. 2nd this war is the longest war ever in US history with no end in site. You all want US soldiers to die for nothing!! Shame
5539 2018-12-23 19:17:05 Panic?  No. Review contents of go bag? Yes. Clean and oil 45? Yes. Verify 3 loaded magazines with defensive rounds? Yes. Check on loved one? Yes. And hug the cats?  Hell yes.
5540 2018-12-23 19:17:01 We were on a tramp and there was no hot water and my make up remover is oil based and I didn't wanna be more greasy!
5541 2018-12-23 19:16:53 The only reason why I agree with 150 billion estimate is that is supposedly what their oil refineries and assets were worth upon seizure. Or at least that’s what I read
5542 2018-12-23 19:16:49 Polls show a majority of Quebecers prefer AB oil to SA oil and (like BC) want the pipeline
5543 2018-12-23 19:16:47 I need to do a hot oil treatment
5544 2018-12-23 19:16:32 He was hanging out with Republicans bragging about making Wall St rich and producing more oil than anybody like 3 weeks ago...
5545 2018-12-23 19:16:32 Have you looked at the price of oil lately? Quid Pro Quo
5546 2018-12-23 19:16:18 The esequivo belong to Venezuela, that territory is in reclamation For so many years, Guyana should'nt explore oil in a territory in dispute
5547 2018-12-23 19:16:12 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
5548 2018-12-23 19:16:06 Dude I’m so happy for you!! Parents and boyfriends/girlfriends can either mix or be like oil and water.
5549 2018-12-23 19:16:03 Most muslim countries are backward, except maybe the ones that have oil.
5550 2018-12-23 19:15:56 You're misleading people. With a switch to electric transportation, and a requirement to #LeaveItInTheGround to avoid more climate change, oil demand is going to drop while supply increases. That means unprofitable prices for #tarsands oil.

5553 2018-12-23 19:15:44 These refs were paid off by oil money #FlyEaglesFly

5555 2018-12-23 19:15:35 You are saying that Turkey should take care of ISIS remains.
It’s like a joke.
It was Turkey delivered weapons to ISIS, buying Oil from ISIS, helped ISIS to get Musil.
At the war of Kobani, Turkey was directly with ISIS....there is camera footages.
No jailed ISIS member in Turkey
5556 2018-12-23 19:15:27 why did I think going to get an oil change today was a good idea?!
5557 2018-12-23 19:15:26 I'd love to buy that skin! Too bad I don't have a Jintsuu to use it on, even after spending over 20k oil on 10-4 
5558 2018-12-23 19:15:21 Who Barack Hussein Obama, the Snake  Oil Salesman !
5559 2018-12-23 19:15:19 Uh sure if you want to burn. I mean olive oil off hair, hair masks, deep hair conditioners.

5561 2018-12-23 19:15:09 Is radis an omega 3 fish oil?
5562 2018-12-23 19:15:01 That the outer flesh of an olive contains up to 30 percent oil—a concentration so impressive that the English word oil comes from the ancient Greek elaia, which means olive.
5563 2018-12-23 19:14:58 Oil is mud.  Again,  your crude oil is processed mud.
5564 2018-12-23 19:14:53 i forgot shatter/oil isn’t legal in Canada like weed and guess who packed ALL THEIR SHATTER AND THEIR PEN IN THEIR SUITCASE PRIOR TO FLYING??? ME. Send prayers that i don’t end up in airport jail.
5565 2018-12-23 19:14:48 She uses only a touch of veg oil but better to not use any version of ghee at all. For ideas and advice join the FB group WFPBNO Desi and increase your #indianfood cooking skills! A nut or seed puree work well to add healthy fats. Especially cashew.
5566 2018-12-23 19:14:38 So, 

You trust Erdogan, but not America's military leaders?

You trust Putin, but not America's intelligence agencies?

You trust oil company lobbyists over climate change scientists?

HOW is ANY of this good judgment?

5567 2018-12-23 19:14:23 The security issue is this turkey. The territorial integrity is not threatened by the USA. It's not the American problem a thousand miles away. You love creating a perception of genocide. Do not stare at the oil wells under the pretext of bringing freedom beyond the ocean.
5568 2018-12-23 19:14:04 Isn’t oil global demand still rising? And don’t all the forecasts see it rising for several decades? Even at peak oil it’s not going to drop off a cliff. If special interests groups would get of out the way, indeed there’s decades upon decades of high value industry potential

5573 2018-12-23 19:13:50 It is beyond absurd to expect #Erdogan to seriously fight #ISIS and to defeat Jihadi terrorists in #Syria, esp since many of them transited through #Turkey on their way to Syria.  
+ both Erdogan & #Assad were buying #oil from ISIS = supporting Jihadists financially
5574 2018-12-23 19:13:37 I lived in AB for 42 yrs between 54-2007, had many friends in the oil patch all did well, 2 made Millions, knew many PPL in AB not associated with oil who lived in abjest poverty, the AB dream was a mith, a balloon that burst, the PCs did that.

5581 2018-12-23 19:12:34 No, there is not. Snake oil.
5582 2018-12-23 19:12:30 Palm oil is also as a Bio fuel.
5583 2018-12-23 19:12:29 .@nathancullen  Alberta's energy policy: sell oil low; buy high for domestic consumption. NDP should push Alberta 1st energy policy: oil processed in a new Alberta refinery for domestic use. Pipelines are not the answer.
5584 2018-12-23 19:12:15 Bruce, instead of making this a carbon tax war how about we do a more effective job of making renewables and other non emitting energy more readily available and affordable. Oh and stop giving a bye to oil sands and cement plants.

5586 2018-12-23 19:12:13 Need to blockade pipeline route so it can be built.!Trump is paying protesters to prevent canada from selling oil to China. Also wants delays so canada can’t sign free trade deals with China after new nafta is signed!

5594 2018-12-23 19:11:03 Stock markets highest in history, employment best, wages up, pulling out of wars, Korea negotiations started, China being taken to task, border control tightening, oil supply and pricing positive, what else. Just continued Trump trashing from left.
5595 2018-12-23 19:10:53 Yes Sir, it is time that the mideast fights it's own real estate oil wars, without innocent Christian Americans dying for Israeli Zionist real estate oil war agendas, and OUR taxes ALWAYS footing THEIR BILLS.We don't need oil Sir, we need the Meyer's water engine conversion kit.
5596 2018-12-23 19:10:33 AB oil busts aren't new. Think back to 2008. Trudeau was prime minister then.

5598 2018-12-23 19:10:24 Turks are also trying to lay claim to half the Greek islands, sea for the oil and gas 
5599 2018-12-23 19:10:19 Then act like it.
5600 2018-12-23 19:10:10 Trumpers keep going on with the lie that Germany's a slave to Russia because of natural gas. FACT: It gets NINE PERCENT of its power from Russia. FACT: The USA buys $7 BILLION of oil a year from Russia. Also, the US has a president who is beholden to Russia. So your point?
5601 2018-12-23 19:10:04 The reason the top estimate is 60 is those were the amounts that Iran was paying Italy and Russia for military systems and oil refinery building.
5602 2018-12-23 19:10:03 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
5603 2018-12-23 19:09:57 Pot is relatively easy and inexpensive to grow, with an amazing affinity to be used. From the fiber to the flower to the oil and seed, it will command value in med, rec,  commercial, industrial, and branding in markets globally
5604 2018-12-23 19:09:51 Harper is a great example of how to screw over the oil and gas industry and put and end to the conservative legacy as it was. Not exactly a shining star example of a politician to look up to.
5605 2018-12-23 19:09:45 Correct. He referred to his own policies as such and very recently was bragging about the US being the leader in oil production. He enshrined much of Bush's legacy. Geez can't imagine why we were less than enthused about his 8 years and dont want another

5610 2018-12-23 19:08:29 i did an olive oil hair mask in my favorite sweater ONCE like FOUR years ago. ive washed it probably 300x and it still smells like olive oil. HOW AND WHY
5611 2018-12-23 19:08:08 Thanks for sharing. It's a really bad thing and I hate seeing such things. But, violent outbreaks from demonstrations can be found in many countries since many years. This specific one has nothing to do with a war, the EU, immigration etc. It's started because of high oil taxes
5612 2018-12-23 19:07:34 Irish mining worth considering, cobalt is found with copper, isn’t it? Suspect currently unviable though. Of course oil has difficulties also, ask the Ogoni people. Important that Ireland works with EU and African Union to address this
5613 2018-12-23 19:07:31 Another 15 years when oil will have no takers all will end.. No takers of these nations.. We know money has corrupted the minds of rich and they will leave as soon as they see these lands are draining their assets.
5614 2018-12-23 19:07:25 I'm trying to pour water on fire. But I don't know which is water and which is oil.
5615 2018-12-23 19:07:17 Trump runs a well oil machine, that has stopped working 3 Times this year alone. If he was a company CEO the board would fire his ass.
5616 2018-12-23 19:07:12 Our oil prices are well past bust, and yes I'm quite aware of it. So what, I shouldn't care about the people affected by it? Is that your stance??
5617 2018-12-23 19:07:06 girl pls don’t put more oil on a fire or i’ll break your neck
5618 2018-12-23 19:06:59 Where do you get the idea that fighting climate change means replacing Alberta oil with oil from other places? I’m genuinely curious.
5619 2018-12-23 19:06:58 I don't understand why people are missing why the stock market is down.

* A trade war with China is going on.
* Oil prices are down
* Housing market is down
* Interest Rates are going up
* Economic data is missing targets
* The US Administration does not inspire confidence.
5620 2018-12-23 19:06:58 Am thinking of taking up peppermint sticks. Or maybe a cute cream tone pipe with a drop of peppermint oil at the end. Would overalls be too much? Maybe dial it back on the overalls? :)
5621 2018-12-23 19:06:43 Ups trucks are gross I just took my phone in and the dude was cleaning out my charger port and was like dude what you do for a living and I told him and he was like I figured oil field with all this dirt in here so I can’t set it on the dash anymore lol

5626 2018-12-23 19:06:00 What about the 300 trillion you spend on attacking the Earth killing women and children so you can steal oil? 5 Billion is peanuts.....
5627 2018-12-23 19:05:36 raspberry cleansing oil nya natural green nder! a lil bit pricey but sangat worth the price

5629 2018-12-23 19:05:29 Taken a look at the tax levels in Norway recently.

Very small population relative to large natural oil resources. Even that isn't helping them much since oil dropped lots from its highs.
5630 2018-12-23 19:05:25 I got oil paints today and I'm so excited to paint something !!!!!!

5637 2018-12-23 19:04:36 Oh please, drop your faux concern. You are completely anti oil and gas, thus is what you dippers are all about.
Tick tock tick tock tick tock your time is running out
5638 2018-12-23 19:04:26 appreciate the implied confidence. and technically i do know "how" to do that. but I also know how to change oil in my truck, but trust professionals instead. to both save time and reduce risk.
5639 2018-12-23 19:04:03 Exactly!  I have no time for “any” politicians, promising something that is BS & cant be achieved.  Or for that matter something they have no intention of delivering.   
Only way to meet Paris climate targets is to shut down Oil & Gas ind & all transportation

5642 2018-12-23 19:03:58 Trump should stop talking to Erdogan. This tyrant cares only about  slaughtering the Syrian Kurds who helped the US destroy ISIS. Trump should remember that Turkey helped ISIS by allowing foreigners to join them and helping them sell oil to guarantee their survival
5643 2018-12-23 19:03:44 Hey,  I'm so disappointed by KU national oil petrol station, on 15th Dec I refilled there but by the time was getting to Nyeri my full tank was empty 5000Kshs. I had to fuel again in Nyeri same amount which toke me to Nyahururu and back to Nairobi and had remain for a week.

5645 2018-12-23 19:03:19 She’s consistently spoken in favour of Alberta’s oil and gas sector and expressed concerns with a number of pieces of Liberal legislation. She’s new to being a politician though, and I’d give her the benefit of the doubt on that second reading vote.
5646 2018-12-23 19:03:09 How did they spill oil! #nailedit
5647 2018-12-23 19:03:06 Exports more expensive to foriegn buyers & imports cheaper so worse balance of trade, & generally lower oil prices to name a few things.
5648 2018-12-23 19:02:56 Ah, that must be why the likes of Stormy Daniels doesn't advertise Oil of Olay.
5649 2018-12-23 19:02:52 'Permaculture and solar, not Exxon', the oil soaked pod seemed to be mouthing, as they fought for air.
5650 2018-12-23 19:02:31 Yes, they'll make nice scapegoats  for your biggest failed promise. 
I don't blame you though.
I blame all the fair weather Patriots that were stupid enough to buy that snake oil.
Getting real results means voting for real Patriots. #VoteThirdParty2020
5651 2018-12-23 19:02:29 I'v seen the"grant programs" before. PSC in NE bury dark lines to service big cities (eventually) rather than build out rural broadband because they say no rural towns apply for said grants. Solar, just like oil and gas decades ago, needs tax incentives for massive build outs.
5652 2018-12-23 19:02:28 #OIL #OOTT #WTI 
Some #futures brokers offer low margin requirements for WTI [$1,000] and #SPX [$500]. Others request full maintenance margin of $4,000+ for WTI and $6,000+ for SPX. Which one would you prefer to trade with?

5655 2018-12-23 19:02:13 Are you one of JCs stupid people. Go on then DUP give them a run for their money you well fkd over Treeza  pretty good. Labour should get you another wee billion funded by Scottish Oil.  But hey Jo for the many not the few lol
5656 2018-12-23 19:01:51 Never happen now trump has opened his mouth or the record and said he wants to use her as a bargaining chip with Chinese! What he really wants is to keep China mad at canada so they cannot sell their oil to them or sign any free trade agreement before senate
5657 2018-12-23 19:01:51 He's right. There is no need for Canadians to buy oil from Saudi Arabia. Past governments have failed Canadians in this regard. Voices of a few have held the Canadian economy hostage. All those who oppose best be driving electric cars, using solar power etc. Or it's hypocritical.
5658 2018-12-23 19:01:50 Oh, they use oil in #Quebec?  Huh, who knew?

5662 2018-12-23 19:01:28 What has @realDonaldTrump  accomplished ?
Well let’s see :
Unemployment: 3.7%

5663 2018-12-23 19:01:27 Also, judging from yr scepticism of climate change & general anger at life, I'm gonna wager that u're a middle-aged white guy who probably got his degree in the 70s/80s (so doubtful u would have studied anything to do with climate science) & who works/worked in the oil industry.
5664 2018-12-23 19:01:19 don't have a lot of sympathy for whiners.  People who blame others for their lot in life. Funny how RW think being gay a choice,but they have right to endless oil jobs, they think women shouldn't have right to choose,but they have rights to always have same job for life. wankers
5665 2018-12-23 19:01:19 If I could live off of only Himalayan salt and olive oil I would
5666 2018-12-23 19:01:10 Sorry that I have to disagree.  
In 2017 about 36% of Germany's electricity came from coal in total, about 2/3 of that from brown coal. 36 % renewables, 12% nuclear power and the rest gas and oil, gas alone at about 11%.
Not all nuclear power plants are shut down yet.

5668 2018-12-23 19:01:00 Assad rarely bombed or confronted ISIS. ISIS terrorists supplied Assad with oil & grain, & they always enjoyed free & safe passage through regime's lines.
5669 2018-12-23 19:00:59 So they’re back to normal
5670 2018-12-23 19:00:56 The gearbox, the oil leaks, the exhaust issues, the engine management system, the LED headlights that never seemed to want to work.........
5671 2018-12-23 19:00:53 Eric you’re an idiot. Toomey is fighting Trump on this. So that means it’s Trump vs. Toomey which means the commander and chief wins every time! By the way 90% of the military loves Trump’s move because now our soldiers are dying over oil and Opium anymore!! Shame shame on you!!
5672 2018-12-23 19:00:50 PLEASE BE CAREFUL USING OIL PAINTS IF YOUVE NEVER PAINTED B4 PLEASE......theyre v hazardous if youre not careful. I havent done any oil painting since college bc of ventilation and space needs actually
5673 2018-12-23 19:00:39 Where will transfer money come from now that @Justintrudeau has killed  golden goose, the oil industry?
Thanks to @Justintrudeau's renewing the 5 yr transfer formula 1 yr early,  it ensures that Quebec got over $19 BILLION!  I'm afraid of what's going to happen next year.
5674 2018-12-23 19:00:32 Why are we buying Saudi oil then? How about you support our awesome country.
5675 2018-12-23 19:00:29 The kurds shed their blood on ISIS.  Mattis won with resolve to stay. Few US casualties.  Russia cant support Syria w/o oil fields to reimburse. We stay Russia bleeds dry.  Campaign promises immaterial to military strategy.
5676 2018-12-23 19:00:28 Illegals can try to suck the economy and the treasury dry all they want. I've got almost 50% of my tax bill that says our military will provide all we need and more going forward. Food, oil, football, beer. You're really worried about illegals costing too much? Bucket, meet drop.

5680 2018-12-23 19:00:09 You like him voting to protect oil companies from having to clean up their own messes or being held liable for environmental damage and loss of life? That’s on his voting record. Our environment can’t support that. But, you do you.
5681 2018-12-23 19:00:09 Empty platitudes from big oil's boy Beto? No, thanks. If he's the nominee in 2020, I'll vote Green at the top of the ticket, again. Give me Sanders or Warren or both, or take a hike.
5682 2018-12-23 19:00:07 Climate denialism has been fostered by the oil companies deliberately, but it must be viewed in a larger trend of anti-intellectualism, people voted for Trump because TV has rendered them dumb as a post, dumbing us down is a deliberate corporatist tactic, fascists want us stupid.
5683 2018-12-23 19:00:05 They’re going after him. Much more than other potential candidates. He’s not that bad. Clearly the idea of being beaten at his game isn’t fun. But Beto did grassroots even better. People get mad that he took oil money. But it’s Texas. A lot of people work in oil. That’s expected.
5684 2018-12-23 19:00:04 if someone wants to pay for my next oil change as a xmas present, I would graciously accept

I was born and raised in Alberta and spent my career in the oil field 
Worked in drilling rigs and finished in mid stream Operations.  We lived the Alberta dream and cashed out 60 days after the NDP were elected.   We sold the grain farm and ranch.

5700 2018-12-23 18:58:20 @lisamurkowski is the reason oil will be drilled in the Arctic.  Native Americans won’t forget.

5702 2018-12-23 18:58:09 Crude oil is nonexistent 
Biomass and ethanol ARE it...

Precious Metals are made not mined. 

Unfortunately...... I’ve been a natural resource and metals analyst for many years on Wall Street.  These fuckers have played us since the start.

5712 2018-12-23 18:57:14 Economically tyrant, lay off crack pipe too sweetheart, Trudeau lowered middle class taxes, more $ and tax free ctb, extended EI, purchased oil pipeline to keep construction going, so stop listening to cpc, read a real book, turn off reallity tv.
5713 2018-12-23 18:57:14 ah yes baby oil, made from liquified babies
5714 2018-12-23 18:57:06 Halve.  Steam 2.5 minutes, toss with red wine vinegar (or citrus), coconut aminos and a spot of olive oil, S&P to taste.  Bacon bits optional.
5715 2018-12-23 18:56:59 I'd prefer anal as a dessert. So, coconut oil would be a great flavor enhancer. And a garnish of whipped cream.
5716 2018-12-23 18:56:51 Let's just hope citeh are paranoid about being banned by ueafa for cheating FFP rules and won't throw more oil money at pep!

5721 2018-12-23 18:56:13 How is American soldiers coming home to their families a pro Russian move? They are American soldiers coming home or do you hate our soldiers so much that you want to waste their life on a war for oil? Shame Shame!!
5722 2018-12-23 18:56:11 Just how essential is this oil?
5723 2018-12-23 18:56:07 Try a homemade sea salt paste too! You put it on overnight & about 2/3 days it should be gone. It’s a bit better than tea tree oil since that can be harsh for certain areas depending on where the keloid gets formed
5724 2018-12-23 18:56:02 Keep Listerine, Castor Oil, burnt eggs, and add that great new flavor lemon fresh Lysol...

5731 2018-12-23 18:55:14 NO MORE WASTED OIL!!! @HendricLady #sundayworshipservice #reloadseries
5732 2018-12-23 18:55:13 I really want to know what happened. Building just don't fall like that. Too hell with it we want Iraq's oil. How did that holy hell of a mess working? Not so much.
5733 2018-12-23 18:54:58 Did You Know: 

CBD Oil Health Use #1 – Reduces Nausea & Vomiting

CBD oil is great for reducing nausea and vomiting, which can occur as symptoms due to most of gastrointestinal disorders, as well as other (more serious) systemic diseases.
5734 2018-12-23 18:54:57 This just in: chili oil and white pyjamas are not a match made in heaven despite what you may have heard.
5735 2018-12-23 18:54:45 裏垢見れば明白だけど、セラピストは全員お金のために働いている。でも、お水と違って、風俗やメンエスはホスピタリティのある女の子がとっても多い。
風俗と比較しても、出来るサービスが限られているからか、やっぱり思いやり溢れる女の子が多いと思う。
5736 2018-12-23 18:54:31 My student missed class because their car needed an oil change and their pencil was out of lead
5737 2018-12-23 18:54:30 The people should be able to understand the basic economics associated with this. Lower oil price = less money for government to spend. But the killer thing here is how we're STILL wasting money on non-essentials, the third national car project being chief.
5738 2018-12-23 18:54:29 How is American soldiers coming home to their families a pro Russian move? They are American soldiers coming home or do you hate our soldiers so much that you want to waste their life on a war for oil? Shame Shame!!
5739 2018-12-23 18:54:27 Sheer claims to be working towards a better future for future generations but also denies climate change and calls oil a clean energy. He can’t keep his messaging consistent.
5740 2018-12-23 18:54:07 I’m sorry but who else’s day gives them a g of oil and half an oz of herb for Christmas besides mine? crazy ass, you’re the best, love you daddy

5742 2018-12-23 18:54:00 Aye.....but we are spongers here. Of course.....

And our oil is a burden not a boon.
5743 2018-12-23 18:53:52 Might also try transdermal via epsom salt in your bath water or even sponge baths w/dilute “magnesium oil”. (Popular name, but it’s just water + MgCl.)
5744 2018-12-23 18:53:11 And what do you do with cocking oil?
5745 2018-12-23 18:53:04 Why would God waste His oil on you when you still stink?!?! @FREEOFNC @HendricLady #sundayworshipservice #reloadseries
5746 2018-12-23 18:53:03 Greenpeace's opposition to hydrogen production using natural gas and capturing the CO2 emissions so that they do not cause global warming (if it does) shows they are not against global warming, they are against oil. GW is just an excuse for their flakey ideas.

5759 2018-12-23 18:51:43 Getting out of my parents' house for a few hours for some literal fresh air since it seems that my mom has gone "nose blind" to the competing scents from the plug-in oil scent diffusers in each room of the house.
5760 2018-12-23 18:51:36 Call me cynical but he has made this announcement on Christmas Eve to save his rotten self from being voted out at the election! He's now using Christ as a vote catcher! Also people with a severe form of MS! I am so ashamed that this sham snake oil salesman is our PM!
5761 2018-12-23 18:51:15 if you’re stupid just take fish oil
5762 2018-12-23 18:51:01 Same. Big fan of CBD oil for medicinal (bought me 6 months time to find best neuronsurgeon). It is made from hemp seeds & plant. This could possibly allow for producers like us to have an opportunity into its production.
5763 2018-12-23 18:50:57 いきなりハグしてくるお客さん、本当に自分のことしか考えていないなと呆れる。健全メンエスではお触り禁止で、そこにはハグも含まれる。

5766 2018-12-23 18:50:38 Joe, what is your other industry? Trucking is subsidized because oil is subsidized and the highways on which you travel are subsidized. And driving a truck around the country does not make you a well-rounded traveler. It means you’ve seen *this* country - not another continent.

5768 2018-12-23 18:50:23 i just had to shoo my cats out of my room because i wanted to put my oil diffuser on and there was already oil in there, and they looked so betrayed, i'm so sorry my angels y'all spend every moment of every day on my bed tho!! i just need a short break

5772 2018-12-23 18:49:59 In 1985, Britain signed the biggest export contract in UK history - the Al Yamamah arms-for-oil deal with Saudi Arabia. BAE Systems was the prime contractor and it paid out billions in bribes to senior members of the Saudi royal family.
5773 2018-12-23 18:49:44 How about this for a "perk", personal invite to the Lucas Oil Suite and an engraved bottle of Jack Daniels Sinatra. 10 great years and counting...
5774 2018-12-23 18:49:42 at least having ideologically aligned support from groups who have a genuine interest in the security of Rojava is far more reliable

and the SAA has been in talks with the SDF for months and it seems the deal is Rojava gives Syria their oil fields, SAA gets military access
5775 2018-12-23 18:49:03 Saw a mouse in my house two nights ago. Trying to get rid of it the no kill way, with peppermint oil. So now when you walk in the front door it’s like getting punched in the face with a candy cane. On the plus side, my sinuses have never been more clear.

5782 2018-12-23 18:48:30 Why not? Not only @ImranKhanPTI but many pak politicians take political advantage of issues related to Indian Muslims. It just adds oil in RW's fire.

5786 2018-12-23 18:47:59 Who is saying "the greatest of all time" It doesn't count if you're the only one saying it. More self promotion of a snake oil salesman and a charlatan. Oh, and one last thing,

5788 2018-12-23 18:47:52 Being a parent and grandparent I also believe these things are important. What parent wants their decedents to live in a country that is filthy because people with no regard for the future want to stuff their pockets with cash from big oil and others who care only for money.
5789 2018-12-23 18:47:51 Polarization is very good, actually. It will take radical anti-capitalist action not just a “passionate voice” of someone beholden to big oil to take on climate change. Time to force people to pick a side. It’s #Bernie2020 or it’s Trump. Inbetweeners like Beto are worthless.

5797 2018-12-23 18:47:02 So today, I am going to attempt to take in the car for an oil change & inspection. Then drive it through a car wash. I also need to pay my taxes or at least put the check in the mail. Otherwise I will ruin the last week of the year worrying about these things.
5798 2018-12-23 18:46:59 And V don't care about CICO model. Barnard, Gregger McDougall all back that CICO theory so they fail on diabetics. Right now after the front organization of PETA & their VEGAN claims. Will come to McDougall starch solution some day. How much of MCT oil taken gets stored?

5800 2018-12-23 18:46:54 Your excellency sir, permit me to ask a question. The bench mark for oil in 2019 budget is $60 pb. But now drop to$45 pb .what will you do to fill d gab, when you become President? Thanks
5801 2018-12-23 18:46:51 Coconut oil also helps 
Also a little known tip...fresh eggs don’t bake as well as eggs that have sat in the fridge a few days (but in either case take the eggs out & let them sit 15-20min before baking)
5802 2018-12-23 18:46:51 Oil of what?

5806 2018-12-23 18:46:20 If you voted for trump, yes it is your fault, if you voted for Stein, yes it is your fault. This carnival barker, snake oil salesman is reeking havoc on this country and all he cares about is himself and how he can profit both economically and mentally
5807 2018-12-23 18:46:20 I really don't like mashed potatoes but I live for the baked and grilled ones, throw some salt, spices and olive oil and *mwah* beautiful

5817 2018-12-23 18:45:29 For a second on this CBS commercial, it was playing Cher and I thought they had just returned to Lucas Oil.  Seems about right.
5818 2018-12-23 18:45:21 Jackson stop! I need all  Bruins fans, management included, to read Haggerty. As an Oil fan, i want nothing more than the massive heartfelt return of Milan Lucic to Boston.

5820 2018-12-23 18:45:02 So does cannabis oil but that doesn’t get promoted, I wonder why, because you can’t make billions from something you can grow in your garden. But they do by synthesising it, have they not learnt from the spice and fentanyl problem

5825 2018-12-23 18:44:16 maybe you dont understand oil and gas pipelines, and mineral rises.  Why Russia is in Crimea and Backing Assad up your education on the Qatar  Turkey Pipeline maybe the picture will become clearer to you
5826 2018-12-23 18:44:11 My brother took my car to get a oil change. Oh I love having a little brother lol
5827 2018-12-23 18:44:10 For the last time. I don't work in the oil and gas industry.

5833 2018-12-23 18:43:38 What’s damaging the pod, is the EXISTING shipping.  Is BC going to immolate itself to save those whales?

Oh, and the septic waste being flooded into their feedstocks probably isn’t helping either. 
Vancouver’s storm sewer system is responsible for more oil in the ocean, than TM.

5840 2018-12-23 18:43:15 We are losing oil by being disobedient to our leaders @worshipper11 #sundayworshipservice #reloadseries
5841 2018-12-23 18:43:13 Obama gave Iran ~$2B. Iran gives Hezbollah ~$1B per year. Iran exports ~1.6 million barrels of oil per day. So knocking oil prices down ~$15/barrel with the help of the Saudis is worth a lot more than 2,000 troops in Syria (assuming prices stay low).
5842 2018-12-23 18:43:10  I'm retired, have some minor investments, but didn't work in that field. 
I have degrees in natural sciences, worked in the oil industry, my passion is reclamation of polluted areas. Checked your profile, liked your pinned tweet.
5843 2018-12-23 18:43:10 And, back to 3) for a moment, Erdoğan reportedly supported Da'esh also by buying the oil they extracted, and allowing arms/fighters to cross border into Syria.
So, given #SyriaWithdrawal, a risk is that Turkey expands its occupation east of Euphrates, involving genocide vs Kurds.
5844 2018-12-23 18:43:08 @WickedHealthy - just purchased Big Bros enchiladas, extremely disappointed to discover that one of the ingredients is palm oil! As a vegan I do not eat any products containing palm oil, due to the cruelty to animals in the harvesting process. #angry #false #Advertising
5845 2018-12-23 18:42:58 Not just any groundnut oil, the one he bought with his money. He might just go and “fall in love” with someone that sells oil now
5846 2018-12-23 18:42:52 Can’t seem to relax. Have chucked a load of lavender oil in the bath water in the hope that helps.

5852 2018-12-23 18:42:15 Couple months ago my dad gave me his car bc “I’m proud of you” ... last night it broke down bc I didn’t check the oil this week & he had to come rescue me at 1 AM
This morning I asked if he was disappointed in me... he said “no, this is just a learning lesson” and let me tell you
5853 2018-12-23 18:42:03 Halah bli.. bli.. jangankan legal. CBD oil untuk kepentingan medical aja gak legal apalagi lintingan. Never deh! hehe dan juga masyarakat indo kan lebih gemar nyalah-gunain. So, it's impossible
5854 2018-12-23 18:41:50 if you're confused... the Happy Orange Gorilla is an oil.
5855 2018-12-23 18:41:25 Lemme get this oil change

5857 2018-12-23 18:41:21 You’re crazy, the Cowboys are the most Overrated team in the nation. That gets Prime Time games due to oil money in Dallas and marketing. The refs are their best friends.
5858 2018-12-23 18:41:20 I got some CBD oil body butter that changes that game.

Assad helped facilitate rise of Da'esh by releasing jihadist prisoners + oil/gas deals
5871 2018-12-23 18:40:12 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
5872 2018-12-23 18:40:12 No, weed increases your heart rate and it would make me tremble and things would be opposite of how they should be when youre stoned. It is not fun to have a panic attack high  but the oil is just CBD, not THC so you get the same positive benefits minus the high
5873 2018-12-23 18:40:12 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

5878 2018-12-23 18:39:50 Why do you think people from all over came to work in the oil fields when it was boom time? They go where there's work, they don't expect to stay home and have it handed to them.
5879 2018-12-23 18:39:33 @Ocasio2018 Along the lines with climate change...has anyone ever done an investigation to determine if Big Oil is paying automobile manufactures NOT to produce electric vehicles, but to build only fossil fuel burners? 20 lbs of CO2 per gallon of gas burned!!

5888 2018-12-23 18:38:47 I know this. But I wouldn’t have to worry about new oil rigs in my mountains. ( Smoky/lower Appalachia). They’ve already been ravaged by the evils of strip mines. The first drilling proposal was shot down, luckily.
5889 2018-12-23 18:38:46 So if anyone wants to get me a Christmas gift I need an oil change really bad 
5890 2018-12-23 18:38:45 To put it in simpler terms: Our oil is the hardest in the world to extract, ship and process. There's a reason why, even with another coastal pipeline, most of it will be headed to the U.S. at a discount.
5891 2018-12-23 18:38:42 You are definitely a contractor on a high platform. Basic ores in trading are your suppliers . Keep base metals, ores and crude oil down and the economy can build .
5892 2018-12-23 18:38:37 It’s not about pipelines, it’s about the oil tankers at the ends of these pipelines and the environmental risks they pose for our people, our cities and our coasts.

5898 2018-12-23 18:38:09 Separation of church and state is pretty easy to understand, like oil and water they don't mix.
5899 2018-12-23 18:38:09 that actually makes complete sense! I grew up eating (and later making) my mom’s scrambled eggs just with s&p and oil so whenever I encounter scrambled eggs elsewhere it always feels too wet and weighed down to me

5919 2018-12-23 18:35:20 The most annoying thing is that the media used the ‘trophies’ stuff to hit Wenger over the head through years of a stadium move, oil money coming in, losing our best players, etc. Now it’s Liverpool & Spurs not winning things, the goalposts have moved. It’s embarrassing.
5920 2018-12-23 18:35:20 ...or Baby Oil

5923 2018-12-23 18:35:10 He literally broke a pledge not to take donations from oil execs, but yeah I guess he thought that was a lie all along and just didn't read it or something.
5924 2018-12-23 18:35:04 Oil and water repel (oil is hydrophobic), they dont actually touch microscopically. They have no intermolecular attractions w one another, therefore you cant saturate water with oil

1) Trudeau responsible for >$100B in energy investment fleeing Alberta - what a gift! 
2) Vacuous lotusland moralizing knows no bounds
3) US oil workers replicate Canada’s entire oil production every ~2 years
5942 2018-12-23 18:32:46 Better hope for 3 things then.

1) That Asia grows a desire to import oil from North America (you can express the % of North American oil in their market using your fingers

2) That they start building refineries

3) That the multitude of world-wide sources of light crude dry up
5943 2018-12-23 18:32:32 Sorry. Don’t want to win turbine in my backyard the same way I don’t want to know oil derrick
5944 2018-12-23 18:32:26 Dose oil tankers are on sale today. Great for topping a joint or blunt or refilling a cartridge!
5945 2018-12-23 18:32:24 Eli feeling that Super Bowl Mojo at Lucas Oil. Impressive bomb. Like what I'm seeing from this team. They came to compete. #GiantsPride #Giants
5946 2018-12-23 18:32:22 Eli did win a Chip in The Oil Can. Don’t forget.
5947 2018-12-23 18:32:19 Down went one charity slush fund and up went another. This just proves there is always someone that  will buy snake oil by the gallons. Drink up Trumpers.
5948 2018-12-23 18:32:18 Many bands along route r strongly in favour of pipeline. Trudeau & his manipulators like Butts, & foreign oil interests funding & throwing up barriers & promoting anti-pipeline protesters. And there's Bill C 69 that'll allow foreigners 2 openly challenge/stop Canadian industries.
5949 2018-12-23 18:32:18 Lucas Oil is the house Manning built
5950 2018-12-23 18:32:17 Clove oil directly to the tooth. Tastes vile but helps. Go to the dentist i had locked jaw too and it was infected
5951 2018-12-23 18:32:13 
5952 2018-12-23 18:32:12 Oil money. Link me x
5953 2018-12-23 18:32:11 I was working Oil Exploration just South of Glacier NP in Montana when it happen & the Governor enacted a 3 day ban on outdoor work.
5954 2018-12-23 18:32:10 Tá acontecendo um troço chato no Lucas Oil Stadium
5955 2018-12-23 18:32:04 If the oil is too much it’s going to just burn and mould
5956 2018-12-23 18:31:47 Music. Crying. Writing and then burning the pages. Lighting candles. Cuddling my cat. Smoking. Drinking. Talking it out with someone. Taking CBD oil. Sleeping
5957 2018-12-23 18:31:36 This pic smells like coconut oil
5958 2018-12-23 18:31:31 Frickin fake news peddler. Why don't u switch to ur original job of selling snake oil with a heavy dose of lies. Shame.
5959 2018-12-23 18:31:19 hey bro no homo but can i use ur cum as body oil again no homo lol
5960 2018-12-23 18:31:17 I have not just seen someone smoking a joint with their pet bird on their head. DO YALL KNOW HOW FUCKIN SENSITIVE BIRDS ARE ITS GOING TO DIE????? SPRAY OIL USED ROOMS AWAY KILLS BIRDS
5961 2018-12-23 18:31:07 No hormones or steroids in my animal food. Animal fat is very healthy. Most of the fat in animals is same as in olive oil. Saturated fat has been shown to be fine for health. I suppose I could come back with glyphosate contaminates veggies. But you probably wash it off.
5962 2018-12-23 18:31:06 300k manufacturing jobs lost in Ontario over a decade and 50k in oil and gas in West, yet we still have lowest unemployment in 40 years. Most lost to automation. Much of this happened under Harper, so why is Trudeau treasonous when I see his doing more about it?
5963 2018-12-23 18:31:00 We’ve been using 5W-40 all year round. It’s stored inside cold storage. Both oil pan and engine block heater...seems fine too.
5964 2018-12-23 18:30:58 It's another extension of our proxy wars with Russia. Putin backs Assad and most of the conflict comes down to rights over an oil pipeline. I understand that pulling out isn't as simple as just up and leaving overnight, but we have to get out. We can't keep doing this.
5965 2018-12-23 18:30:58 Do you ever hang them upside-down and dry them?  Or dip them in silica to dry?  Or pack them in oil to make rose oil?
5966 2018-12-23 18:30:51 nunca entenderé a la gente que se va de viaje unos días y ya extraña la comida como si llevaras años fuera del país, en lugar de aprovechar el viaje y probar nuevos sabores, nuevos platillos y sazones. En fin, mejor viaja en el interior de la República qué hay mucho que conocer
5967 2018-12-23 18:30:43 Manning going deep in Lucas Oil Stadium. This time it was Eli for 55 yards. #Colts
5968 2018-12-23 18:30:38 Who’s trying to change my oil for me because I am too damn lazy right now
5969 2018-12-23 18:30:36 the weed issue was only to motivate the potheads to vote, lets hope they stay home in '19. 
the oil issue seems to be to please big unions, once the pipelines are built they run themselves (mostly) unions need their dues to pad the execs back pocket.
5970 2018-12-23 18:30:32 Definitely putting oil over the fire! Still not clear why Trump would believe and rely on the wannabe Sultan Erdogan. The guy helped ISIS all along, and now he promised Trump that he will take care of them? Erdogan will instead slaughter the Syrian Kurds who helped us beat ISIS!
5971 2018-12-23 18:30:30 1 Cup Flour

5972 2018-12-23 18:30:29 Well said Steve. I can’t believe so many people are still stupid enough to fall for the BS from that Snake Oil Merchant in the White House.
5973 2018-12-23 18:30:27 I just bought the oil control one from urban and I’m reallllly liking it!!!!! I use it everytime I put a face of makeup on

5975 2018-12-23 18:30:03 I put last spring's tax refund into an emergency car repair fund.

Which, despite a cross country road trip (6000 miles!) I didn't need. I think I got a couple of oil changes.

I'm taking $110 out and going to buy toys for toy drives.
5976 2018-12-23 18:30:01 During his visit on Wednesday, Sarraj met with the representatives from the “Fezzan Rage Movement” and leaders from Battalion 30 affiliated with the oil facilities guards. #Libya
5977 2018-12-23 18:29:43 Whey y'bugger! There's Souness saying expensively assembled Everton shouldn't have 'taken spurs on at their own game' yet did him and his chums not berate Benitez with his team of bargain buys for not 'having a go' against oil money Man City? 
5978 2018-12-23 18:29:34 なんでこんなにも
5979 2018-12-23 18:29:29 No problem. Also butter is great for flavor but doesn't give you the moistest or tenderest crumb. You get that from oil or shortening. I dislike shortening, so do half and half with a good European butter with a higher fat content and a buttery Olive oil.
5980 2018-12-23 18:29:22 Very little blame is out on Rand Paul for convincing the president to pull out of #Syria before defeating #ISIS and giving oil to #Iran
5981 2018-12-23 18:29:06 Detroit’s will always leak oil but 0/40 is what we do for winter only a change or two per truck and then back to 15/40 for spring summer fall
5982 2018-12-23 18:28:55 What The Shit! The United States is *HIC* is by far the largest in the oil and gas from Russia.
5983 2018-12-23 18:28:43 When I look at Schiff, my first thought is that he is the epitome of a snake oil salesman. My second thought is schiester.
5984 2018-12-23 18:28:28 If you read Maghreb politics you will realize Sudan has been simmering for a while due to dictatorship,drought and South Sudan moving away with the oil fields hence economic downturn
5985 2018-12-23 18:28:22 Making rum slush. It is the best drink for the best time of year. Frozen limeade, lime juice, lime oil, sugar, cranberry juice, & a ton of white rum. Gets all sticky slushy and you top it with soda water or sparkling wine. Divine.
5986 2018-12-23 18:28:14 Therapy!!!!! 
Meditation!!!!
CBD Oil!!!!
Essential Oils!!!
5987 2018-12-23 18:27:50 It's not an opinion to say oil is dying. The prices show that
5988 2018-12-23 18:27:48 Hopefully not mine. I don’t need that much burnt oil in the air #MySubaruIsFallingApart #CantBeLegal.
5989 2018-12-23 18:27:47 What!? You read the article to actually see what it said? Pretty sure that’s a violation of Twitter protocol.
5990 2018-12-23 18:27:37 nah, deep cleaning is bad for my health apparently. Had to help cleaning the store where i work at yesterday and spent 3 hours kneeling and brushing oil out of the floor... it may not sound like it but it was tiring as fuck and this pain is the aftermath
5991 2018-12-23 18:27:36 you need motor oil stop at a garage they’ll fix that in 2 min
5992 2018-12-23 18:27:12 Again:
Where There Is Oil
Don't Throw A Stone There!
5993 2018-12-23 18:27:05 Good one. 

Oh that reminds me of another fav finger dipping combo... balsamic vinegar and Olive oil! After all the baguette is gone of course. lol
5994 2018-12-23 18:26:52 Or different cooking oil. (Sorry, that’s a GOTBO.*)

*Glimpse of the bleedin’ obvious
5995 2018-12-23 18:26:44 I’m getting my oil changed and dude says.. “here’s the remote I know you don’t wanna watch football.” .. what if I did  women watch sports too ugh
5996 2018-12-23 18:26:42 A belated reciprocated #FF for @davidgaffen, a great source on all things oil and gas, energy in general, and other interesting stuff
5997 2018-12-23 18:26:14 は？
5998 2018-12-23 18:26:08 Their brain refused to tell them that you can't get quality university education for 100k. Apparently, it must have been subsidised by someone; government. The subsidy payment is what @ASUUNGR  is requesting 4, just as their colleague in the oil sector.
5999 2018-12-23 18:26:06 “Smile. Life is good!” 
Here’s some STFU oil, Cheryl. 
6000 2018-12-23 18:26:04 Your positive message is weaponizing a downturn in oil prices by dishonestly blaming your political opponents and promising solutions that aren't realistic.
6001 2018-12-23 18:26:02 Treasures of the East. A Shea based hair and body oil made right here in Philly! Me and my fam been using it for years!
6002 2018-12-23 18:25:42 And on top of everything, Quebec preferring Saudi oil.  Unbelievable!
6003 2018-12-23 18:25:37 More than a few times I've cooked mine for 45 minutes, pulled one out to check for doneness and cooked for another 15 minutes.

WTF is blanching going to do? Might as well serve it uncooked and claim you enjoy the "raw" flavor (especially when paired w/ olive oil & sesame seeds).
6004 2018-12-23 18:25:34 NoDak is Open! Stop by between 10:30am and 12:30pm and say “high” to Select Oil!
6005 2018-12-23 18:25:32 Mad KGB skills.  He saw through the snake oil salesman pitch The Gullibles took as gospel.
6006 2018-12-23 18:25:29 only because there is not enough investment in clean technology because we are STILL too invested in oil and gas.
6007 2018-12-23 18:25:16 The last great moment in the history of the New York Football Giants occurred in Lucas Oil Stadium.
6008 2018-12-23 18:25:12 Did Trudeau not just buy the Trans Mountain Pipeline, and gave the oil industry a 1.6 Billion Dollar Bail Out .
6009 2018-12-23 18:25:11 CBD oil still banned in SD. Silly separate issue, this should tip that over eventually. #Silliness
6010 2018-12-23 18:24:52 And CBD oil definitely helps my pain most days. If the pain is super intense then it’ll just take the edge off but it helps with my daily pelvic pain and I’m not completely bedridden anymore, just have to take it easy  x
6011 2018-12-23 18:24:24 see why i said we are no longer friends? red oil head
6012 2018-12-23 18:24:21 why do white people make scrambled eggs with milk....? black pepper, salt and a spoonful of oil. that’s all you need. scrambled eggs are not meant to be gross and moist ya heathens
6013 2018-12-23 18:24:20 How much y’all oil change be?
6014 2018-12-23 18:24:11 Lime essential oil 
6015 2018-12-23 18:24:04 There's literally nothing he could do that Albertans would appreciate because their position is one of bad faith. He could singlehandedly make oil $200/barrel and they'd still complain.
6016 2018-12-23 18:24:04 I’m considering selling my favorite little Toyota.  It is far from perfect.  It has an oil leak at the front of engine.  I just watch it close.  Recent tires.  Recent brakes.  I’ll be getting a newer one if it sells.  Great truck driven daily.
6017 2018-12-23 18:23:57 It's not complicated. Many women agree with their men. Like minds stick together.  I'm not saying its right, I'm just saying. I see it every day in my neck of the woods. Men make big oil money around here. Women don't. They marry it.
6018 2018-12-23 18:23:44 In 2008 Barack Hussein Obama said "For the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, we must end the age of oil in our time." Ten years later he takes credit for the US becoming world's largest producer of oil.
6019 2018-12-23 18:23:31 Of course but Vontaze kept screwing us over in back to back seasons.

1) In 2014 during the Wild Card at Lucas Oil Stadium penalties Vontaze committed gave Indianapolis 60 yards.

2) In 2015 when we hosted Pittsburgh Vontaze committed 45 yards in penalties.
6020 2018-12-23 18:23:26 no we prop the US. Thats who we sell 99% of our oil to. but Your point is taken. You seen genuine. but your facts are not right. please research before you post. Your credibility takes a hit.
6021 2018-12-23 18:23:20 1 paint of Rice #1400
I kilo of Chicken #1100
Vegetable Oil #700
1 carton of Pepsi #1100

0012006918 GTB... Xmas made!
6022 2018-12-23 18:22:49 No. At least two US States have a bigger economy.  Russia is a Mob Boss, henchmen, and army, but good at deception, and cyberwar. The western elites and their politicians surrendered. They don't want to suffer economic pain that victory by sanctions, oil/gas embargoes would bring
6023 2018-12-23 18:22:40 It's just a rallying cry for the "Blue No Matter Who" crew to amplify their anti-Bernie sentiments. Favored talking point ATM is that Bobby O'Rourke's fossil fuel cash is from workers, not corporate. No answer on whether this will influence him to give Big Oil an easy ride!
6024 2018-12-23 18:22:37 Could drive a fucking oil tanker between Coleman and Keane today.
6025 2018-12-23 18:22:35 I need the dollar to weaken for oil, my oil stocks have gotten killed
6026 2018-12-23 18:22:29 Хмхмхмхмх, ну, я как человек, который знает твое имя, могу сказать, что оно тебе подходит)
6027 2018-12-23 18:22:25 きたぁああああああああぁぁぁ
6028 2018-12-23 18:22:20 きた
6029 2018-12-23 18:22:16 Really? I'm a bit surprised. Now I need to plan a trip.
Yeah, I actually have to cook now, which is fine. Except I never expected how limited groceries would be in a small town in the dead of winter. I had to bring truffle oil and a few other things from home to cope.
6030 2018-12-23 18:21:54 you're lookin at a lot of oil and careful probing of chicken temperature
6031 2018-12-23 18:21:54 I use CBC oil and capsules plus 
Med. Weed perfect. 37 surgries
Later it is hard to get off the 
Hydo or the oxy but once you
Do it is better i still need them
Some but i have went down alot
I also do a lot less activity
6032 2018-12-23 18:21:42 It won't bc Scheer/Kenney are all about oil and they don't give a damn about Canadians or climate change.
6033 2018-12-23 18:21:34 Americas history with the troops is like the history of a bad boyfriend, they mean to pull out they just forget. It's called passion. for democracy. Gotta get that wet wet oil
6034 2018-12-23 18:21:28 Of course, but doing so affects only the financial economy. Reducing $ oil price, on the other hand (which in my analysis, China is currently engaged in doing either actively or passively) affects the real economy by cutting energy costs.
6035 2018-12-23 18:21:27 Car dealers giving money to politicians and other policy makers?
Perhaps the oil industry?
6036 2018-12-23 18:21:09 Correct but where do we go from here? We all know the attack by the US against Iraq. Bush, Cheney and Bolton: WMD’s, Sadaam Hussein and oil? So fir those who suggest that it was up to President Clinton or President Obama to clean up after?
6037 2018-12-23 18:21:07 We can’t especially fix the problems our corporate overlords created overseas. NAFTA is a major issue in the nonsensical wars the USA started thanks to cia involvement so big oil can get what they want. The whole Isis thing was generated by us arms dealers the the media

6040 2018-12-23 18:20:58 If it were not for their supreme ruler Ayatollah Khomeini,USA,Britain and France who have overthrown that regime and install their puppet to siphon Iranian Oil.
6041 2018-12-23 18:20:57 This picture represents every quintessential aspect of the Trump Presedency, from his primary spectacles to current day. He’s nothing but a “snake oil salesman” with @FoxNews mass marketing
6042 2018-12-23 18:20:57 It does say sustainable palm oil, which is better than just palm oil that is used in everything else. I try to avoid palm oil in most foods. Which is easier being vegan.

6048 2018-12-23 18:20:25 I made a living with that trade after discharge. Oil field. Gulf of Mexico. Thirty years. But only three diving myself.

I went into saturation diving. It takes a team of twenty professionals to keep one diver at a time safely on the work site for a 24 hour day.

Good work.
6049 2018-12-23 18:20:19 we should be an oil powerhouse yet we can't even sell a bag of weed apparently. sad, so very sad.
6050 2018-12-23 18:19:59 Please start drinking MTC oil so your mind will clear.

And the change to fill gas
E no most make I wear new cloth or shoe make I just chop better thing
6055 2018-12-23 18:19:17 @leahmcelrath Do you have a copy of the list of executives on the oil/gas pledge list?  That one that Beto supposedly failed off of?
6056 2018-12-23 18:19:11 I already responded to your bizarre statement on oil subsidies.

State subsidies are a guarantee that capital will not be allocated optimally. Usually leading to death of the industry. Look at solar firms in Germany. Once leading, now subsidized to death. Gone. Great achievement.

6059 2018-12-23 18:18:52 I wonder when the southsouth will wake up and understand that the oil is the only reason they managed to see them as Nigerians.
6060 2018-12-23 18:18:48 isnt doing sumn artistic both oil paint and digital
6061 2018-12-23 18:18:48 I do too. I take a deep glass bowl grease the inside w 2-3 tblspoons of peanut oil in the bottom w a piece of Reese cup  n the bottom center then put some wood blocks for them to climb to access the rim   They will climb in escape. Empty mice in 5 gal bucket take away, release

6063 2018-12-23 18:18:24 I could do to buy more cbd oil anyway but it’s just so expensive
6064 2018-12-23 18:18:14 The economy?  The economy that was just recently seeing rare synchronized global growth and the two largest economies on track for 6% & 2.5% GDP growth?  #Oil is sentiment driven imo.

6067 2018-12-23 18:17:50 Frankincense and myrrh are basically aromatherapy shit. So two of the three wise men were basically essential oil pyramid salesmen predecessors. Talk about some shitty baby gifts.
6068 2018-12-23 18:17:47 All of them are more interested in $$$ off of OIL than any diplomacy. The US is illegally in Syria against international law. Russia isn't
6069 2018-12-23 18:17:46 I agree, parts failures added interest to the show. Now they could go 1000 miles and the biggest risk is probably the oil pump belt.
6070 2018-12-23 18:17:46 Should be 170 million.
6071 2018-12-23 18:17:45 Hey. Yeah I tried it recently and had a severe allergic reaction  it’s typical as it actually helped the pain. Tried 500mg and also 250mg and still had a reaction  now on CBD oil for pain relief and see what my doctor says next for pain relief x
6072 2018-12-23 18:17:45 Yes, they can. Because we are in a disinflatonary industrial -digital- revolution, the world economy is weaker and on the verge of commercial war, the dollar is strong, price of commodities & oil is falling, globalization means price competition, trade unions have lost power, ..

6074 2018-12-23 18:17:09 The biggest concern is who controls and own the images once it’s uploaded to the cloud.  Data/Medical data is the modern day oil and the most valuable commodity. Tech companies will monetize this data to their own benefits.
6075 2018-12-23 18:17:04 Have you ever considered trying an amber necklace for teething? @RachelleSwannie we got ocean one and the pumpkin butt teething oil and it has worked wonders
6076 2018-12-23 18:17:04 I just bought some organic olive oil from Turkey. It is excellent.
6077 2018-12-23 18:17:02 And Mr Scheer has magic wand to allow  a conservative pipeline across Quebec to get Canada off Saudia Arabia oil imports to eastern canada #ctvqp #cdnpoli and speaking further to oil - not one mention of newfoundland oil and renting oil tankers to get the east coast off imports
6078 2018-12-23 18:17:01 There is 2 trillion of USD denom debt extended to CN & HK firms. Oil complex related USD debt is massive. Interlinkage wwide? $DB is below $10 w balance sheet much larger than LEH

C'è molto da fare, si farà, ormai è questione di tempo.
6080 2018-12-23 18:16:55 You still dont get it. We no longer have time for lesser evilism. Candidates in the Clinton mold have no interest in a green new deal, bc they don't really believe the science. Well, they do... But all that oil money.
6081 2018-12-23 18:16:53 Says the american city fan. Piss off bandwagon boy. I'm sure you were a city fan way before the oil money, right??
6082 2018-12-23 18:16:49 Brócoli , olive oil , sea salt , or pink salt, whole grain bread , sweet potatoes, non dairy milk bc it’s not fattening , no juice unless organic with low sugar, no soda , just water . A choice of a healthy cereal . What you don’t buy you won’t crave !
6083 2018-12-23 18:16:39 As for your knuckle slapping of greedy Alberta..

That’s up to interpretation as yes we had a dumb government that didn’t save properly 

An old trailer in fort Mac cost a million bucks

Cost of living in oil country is a little higher than Quebec

6085 2018-12-23 18:16:28 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
6086 2018-12-23 18:16:16 Why don't we dig a little 2 ft ditch along the border and call it a big, beautiful moat? How about sending off fireballs of oil with a slingshot? How about putting trampolines all along the border so when folks climb over the wall they'll land on the tramps and then bounce back

6088 2018-12-23 18:16:07 We finally managed to plan a family Christmas during Bush 42’s DesertShield oil war. I got a call that my USMC hubby was being deployed to an unknown place for an undisclosed length of time. Deployments suck but they heighten my appreciation for our Military.
6089 2018-12-23 18:16:06 Today's the day! Coconut oil hair mask, bleach bath, dye, and then I'll be a green haired lady. 
6090 2018-12-23 18:16:06 Its just a bit of eczema. Rub some baby oil on it
6091 2018-12-23 18:15:58 Also can somebody deliver me some oil cus I’m cranky
6092 2018-12-23 18:15:44 Please report on how the US is illegally in Syria against international law. SMH 
Rand Paul, Ro Khanna and Ted Lieu think it's a good idea. Only the warmongering Neo Cons and Neo Liberal petro $ folks are having a hissy fit. Do you think they own stock in MIC or OIL???
6093 2018-12-23 18:15:25 Oil price is weakening while US$ is strengthening therefore local currency must adjust to contain inflation. In process, people buying power becomes a nightmare.
6094 2018-12-23 18:15:04 Panels NOT piplines. California is. GO Solar/Wind NOW. Stop all oil imports. Restrict domestic US oil to only proven sources. Stop shale oil extration, no more fracking. Clean renewable power sources only. America can & must wean itself from old energy & IC vehicles. Buy EVs now.
6095 2018-12-23 18:15:01 #thearchers Alice sold Adam a drone didn't she? Just wondering ...
6096 2018-12-23 18:14:52 That sounds like the loveliest surprise ever.
Have a lovely time x
6097 2018-12-23 18:14:39 It’s not even a bust it’s the liberal government working against the oil industry. They only bought the pipeline because they would have had a nafta lawsuit.  Naw they stall stall stall.
6098 2018-12-23 18:14:39 Venezuela relies on oil for 97% of their exports. If that oil had been owned by corporations, that would still mean nothing if oil prices ranked and if the government was still disliked by people like the USA
6099 2018-12-23 18:14:36 Anything that runs in winter or only 1 oil change a year gets 0W-40. Runs in summer only gets 15W-40.  The only other engine oil around here is this 5W-20 the GF's SUV and mom's car calls for.
6100 2018-12-23 18:14:31 What wars in South America did the United States start?  Colonialism has given us clean water, reliable electric, hospitals, education, standard structure.  The US is the worlds largest oil producer and it’s cheaper than ever.  Cheap labor?  You mean illegal immigrants?

6102 2018-12-23 18:14:15 Oh bull . It's about being egotistical whiners and being racist.

You're a racist, plain and simple.

You are in no danger from immigrants.

And Alberta led the country in economic growth last year.

So, seriously, hush. The oil industry is less than 3.5 % of GDP FFS.
6103 2018-12-23 18:14:14 What do you have against innovation? Oil is non renewable. Once it’s gone it’s gone. Technology will improve your life and it won’t rely on oil and coal.
6104 2018-12-23 18:14:06 Disagree - if we had the energy east line we could eliminate oil imports on the eastern coast.
6105 2018-12-23 18:13:59 The world must to use less oil. AB/SK will continue to produce oil for long time but at lesser volumes. Economy needs some other industry to grow. The earlier you start, the easier transition will be.
6106 2018-12-23 18:13:47 I love that you have to "like" your own tweet!!  Enjoy your snake oil!
6107 2018-12-23 18:13:46 Defense better show up big today. Don’t blow this!!!!!
6108 2018-12-23 18:13:42 You don’t understand simple economics: extracting a material ONCE to make batteries is far better for the environment than extracting oil over and over and over again to be CONSUMED. Don’t get me wrong, EVs are close but not there yet, but don’t use flawed logic it’s embarrassing
6109 2018-12-23 18:13:24 Drink castor oil
6110 2018-12-23 18:13:13 First of all I will massage you when we are naked and use an olive oil then kisses all over your face hehe

Conclusion :
I wont make you hurt like in the vid 
6111 2018-12-23 18:13:12 Saudi & the petrodollar is what influences the US government. Remember US invaded Iraq, deposed Saddam, & converted Iraqi oil sales back to the U.S. dollar. Sam with Gaddafi when he tried to create a unified African currency backed by Libyan gold reserves to to sell African oil.
6112 2018-12-23 18:13:06 Had a horrific one yesterday. Excedrin, a bath, peppermint oil on my temples, and forcing myself to eat a lil bit (they make me nauseous too) made it go away in 2 hours
6113 2018-12-23 18:12:52 I'm about to cook up a storm and by storm i mean disaster. I'm about to make the most miserable looking pancakes. Na only me dey fry pancake wey dey scatter inside oil, but i go chop am like that.

6116 2018-12-23 18:12:09 Finally gotta oil change 
6117 2018-12-23 18:12:05 Hmmm both have palm oil in. They are very naughty Unicorns.
6118 2018-12-23 18:12:04 This is true, we are. And let us remember the reason we even inserted ourselves into the Middle East to begin with: oil. But now that we are there we cannot just walk away. There needs to be a strategic, diplomatic exit plan. Something that isn’t happening.
6119 2018-12-23 18:12:01 スマブラとまらないね
6120 2018-12-23 18:11:54 Shaw - Media which is really Shaw oil owns the Global Television Network in Canada - plus at one point NatGeo Canada was owned by one of them. SO pathetic. Like that news station is going to feature Climate Change and Green energy seriously.
6121 2018-12-23 18:11:52 There are multiple disconnects:

1. Albertans who ignore how much Trudeau has done for them (much more than Harper)

2. Vancouverites who want to ban oil while sitting in traffic in gas powered cars

3. Prairie oil workers who are in denial about climate change

6124 2018-12-23 18:11:09 Not creeping haha just reading responses so I’m tagging onto what I just tweeted at you - weed didn’t have the same positive effect as the oil? Now I’m really interested because same - weed doesn’t HELP (and I’m surviving on pills but don’t want to if I can help it) so if oil
6125 2018-12-23 18:10:49 Coconut oil and cocoa butter
6126 2018-12-23 18:10:47 Focusing on oil is fighting the proverbial last war. It’s a finite respurce. The winner of the next proverbial war will be the one who controls and can provide the largess of an infinite resource.
6127 2018-12-23 18:10:44 y’all i was craving hummus and started making it (so i mixed lemon juice, olive oil, spices, etc) and didnT EVEN CHECK IF I HAVE CHICKPEAS...
6128 2018-12-23 18:10:44 Oil dealer like you
6129 2018-12-23 18:10:43 Im remembering painting w oils in high school and how unsafe I was being about it like using mineral oil in my bedroom w/o ventalation and just throwing my rags everywhere YIKES
6130 2018-12-23 18:10:39 That makes no sense at all. The world needs more Canadian oil & gas, not less. If you want fewer emissions, tell people to ride bikes and walk - ban autos from downtown Toronto & Montreal, that sort of thing. Which, as this is an emergency, we should have done by now.
6131 2018-12-23 18:10:37 There can be no reduction in carbon without giving up a standard of living. Oil for example, produces pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, synthetic fibres, heats homes and fuels farm equipment, jets & cars.
How can alternative energy replace the equivalent in oil?
6132 2018-12-23 18:10:37 Obama bragged about making America the world’s top oil producer. Establishment Democrats can say they oppose climate change but they’re not going to do much about it.
6133 2018-12-23 18:10:30 def the worst day so far post surgery, but my essential oil diffuser helps sooo much

6136 2018-12-23 18:10:08 I could’ve had an oil change a week ago but the first thing my dad tells me every time I see him is that I need an oil change

6138 2018-12-23 18:10:03 Fuck holidays fuck brunch fuck holiday brunches fuck ur lil snotty nose fucking kids fuck ur lives fuck ur olive oil allergy fuck u FUCK
6139 2018-12-23 18:09:56 It can't be sold on equal ground because it's not equal. Bitumen is low-quality product that requires special refining, so it's not worth as much as other kinds of oil. Plus it costs more to extract in the first place. Who's going to pay the difference to create honest jobs?
6140 2018-12-23 18:09:52 Holiday car travel tip. At a minimum check your oil level and tire pressure before going on the open road. Safe travel :)

6142 2018-12-23 18:09:50 Mi moto sigue en fuel oil creo 
6143 2018-12-23 18:09:41 In Canada, we have two major federal political parties. One, the Conservatives, won't do anything to address climate change. Two, the Liberals, won't do anything effective to address climate change and promotes the oil and gas industry. See why I go @CanadianGreens?
6144 2018-12-23 18:09:40 He is still eating baby food out of a syringe, but we got a new recipe from a Vet that we are trying today. He is also on CBD oil, which is helping a lot.
6145 2018-12-23 18:09:24 Shoutout to the guy at Valvoline for hooking me up with a $10 off coupon for my oil change. Let good things happen to this man

6148 2018-12-23 18:09:14 Putin needed a president who would disregard climate change & throw us into lasting reliance on fossil fuels. They had a huge plan for the Russian oil fields. Climate & humanity is never a consideration.  Nature & habitats have no meaning
6149 2018-12-23 18:09:08 Oil cleansers are 
6150 2018-12-23 18:09:03 We have clean technologies in those industries. For instance steam assistant gravity oil production in oil sands.
6151 2018-12-23 18:08:58 Nothing compares to EVs?
Please, google the numbers first, Wolfgang.
Oil/fossil fuels get 20 billion per year. Dream on, Wolfgang.
6152 2018-12-23 18:08:53 You do realize you use oil and gas everyday right. That is being pulled out of the ground and refined and sold to Canada. I'd rather use Alberta oil and see the people of Alberta working and spending. If your so scared of a spill turn your heat off and get walking. Smh.
6153 2018-12-23 18:08:47 I would have sued the judge and lawyers and eye witnesses
6154 2018-12-23 18:08:42 My mom and I quote: “Morgan if you take that oil pen to your grandparents for Christmas I’ll end you” ... bet

6156 2018-12-23 18:08:20 Yeah but occasionally I’ll glance at the decoration-books. Why just this morning I read three paragraphs of “Lord Jim”
6157 2018-12-23 18:07:59 I like to get into the mountains on my Sunday’s. Today I’m making some cannabis oil for gifts!
6158 2018-12-23 18:07:58 Over the years, constituency empowerment have been an insult to our people.
Sharing rice & oil in place of jobs to youths on TV is mockery.
Business loans for entrepreneurial youths, agricultural subsidies to farmers, scholarships for students, now that's empowerment.
6159 2018-12-23 18:07:57 I'm all for hydro power as its clean. But solar and wind are dirtier to build and not efficient. Id love nuclear but all the environmental idiots cry that its bad. As for batteries they are super expensive and dirty to build. Oil is fine and coal is fine as well.
6160 2018-12-23 18:07:51 Lack of it is assured poverty, it should have been our fallback when oil resources dwindled, but it wasn't there
6161 2018-12-23 18:07:39 Our ever increasing dwindling oil reserves, its been runnin oot since the day they found it, but they just keep finding more.
6162 2018-12-23 18:07:26 Venezuela Navy Interrupts Oil Exploration Off Guyana
6163 2018-12-23 18:07:11 Boots off, Where's the WD40?...not here, not there.  Bet you it's in the truck.  Too bad. Olive oil on the zipper, to be able to put my boots ...
6164 2018-12-23 18:07:10 Why are the only people that say CBD oil isn’t straight edge people that aren’t straight edge lol
6165 2018-12-23 18:07:09 Ask the restaurant if there’s soy, soy oil and/or ANY seed oil being used. If you’re a Man, you don’t support businesses that poison you and those you know

6168 2018-12-23 18:06:56 My car oil is at 4% I can’t even drive to get new oil and oil filter 
6169 2018-12-23 18:06:51 Keeping troops here helps the Arms dealers, the oil barons, the dictators ,we spend Trillions of Dollars to do so, the only people who suffer most are the Wounded Warriors and their families, Trump is bringing them home,  that is why families of these troops love him.
6170 2018-12-23 18:06:51 He's into oil business(big time) and also into music business bit unfortunately for you he's married with lovely kids. All this is very very genuine. Thank you
6171 2018-12-23 18:06:50 Me Chimpy agrees....oil is way to go.
If wanting actual weed then knowing someone that “knows someone” is still best quality.
6172 2018-12-23 18:06:48 Vitamin E oil at night. What are you using as a moisturizer?
6173 2018-12-23 18:06:44 Can you get medical marijuana there? CBD oil? Alternative/holistic medications can seem a little over the edge, but maybe worth a shot?
6174 2018-12-23 18:06:42 Bigger problem now is that VZ’s oil is very sour and more & more of US refining capacity wants it as US shale cranks out more light & sweet
6175 2018-12-23 18:06:35 Don't buy our Oil locally buy it from Saudi Arabia instead
6176 2018-12-23 18:06:19 There are two types of people: (1) Those who do the work (2) Those who make announcements. You’re a lazy snake oil salesman.
6177 2018-12-23 18:06:09 I think, if he comes back for a one-shot, Grog would like this. If not, Yasha could sure use it! @WillingBlam @TheVulcanSalute *Bugbear leg oil lamp from the far off kingdom of Fragile not included.
6178 2018-12-23 18:05:52 I suspect if I could get some kit installed to serve it my Wife would like one of those Neck Oil KeyKegs about now :-)
6179 2018-12-23 18:05:50 Let’s see if this coconut oil remedy works 
6180 2018-12-23 18:05:49 I think that means you need a beard balm/salve/oil
6181 2018-12-23 18:05:20 My nana is definitely gonna drown us in holy oil for that 
6182 2018-12-23 18:05:19 How come you have exempted oil from Saudi Arabia from your carbon tax and are not subjecting Saudi oil to the same environmental regulations you have imposed on Western Canadian oil @JustinTrudeau ? #cdnpoli #Canada #yyc #yeg #ywg #yxe
6183 2018-12-23 18:05:15 .@realDonaldTrump Doesn't Texas produce a lot of oil? Wouldn't Texas like a pipeline from Texas to California? Put a pipeline on top of the wall and make Texas pay for the wall.
6184 2018-12-23 18:05:13 Thank you!  Heat some olive oil in a skillet, add the cubed potatoes, cook, covered, over medium heat, (flipping the potatoes over occasionally) about 15 min or till they're golden brown & tender, add salt to taste, plus I like to add some Italian seasoning! 
6185 2018-12-23 18:05:02 How to sear salmon filet perfectly... cast iron, medium heat, no oil, flip once. Perfection. Served with quinoa and kale salad.
6186 2018-12-23 18:04:52 @RachelNotley @Brian_Pallister @PremierScottMoe @fordnation all your provinces are on board for a pipeline maybe you could build energy east bypass Quebec and take it into Sault Ste. Marie and ship the oil out that Great Lakes and St Lawrence seaway.
6187 2018-12-23 18:04:47 Just like Tillerson from big oil as sec’y of state. Yikes.
6188 2018-12-23 18:04:42 It's amazing people brooding over pricing of piddly oil and haven't figured it out when the same things been happening all the time in the exorbitant real estate business
6189 2018-12-23 18:04:40 "He's also the CEO of the 'Spark of Freedom Foundation', and senior fellow for environment and energy policy at The Heartland Institute.

6190 2018-12-23 18:04:38 Again, see the very article you posted about Labour's commitment to North Sea oil, inter alia.

6194 2018-12-23 18:03:54 I've lived in AB all my life & been laid off three times before because of poor economy & low oil prices over the last 35 years. In those days we saw that as being part of the deal when your economy is based on a boom & bust cycle, & we got other jobs & carried on. 1/2
6195 2018-12-23 18:03:41 Dude said he went in for an oil change and came off the lot w a new car 
6196 2018-12-23 18:03:14 Oil and gas are to big and rule without any impunity. They want to destroy the water table and we are gonna fight u tooth and nail about it.
6197 2018-12-23 18:03:12 i literally got my oil changed on the 6th and i only have 1000 more miles till my next one, these road trips are killin me but i’m not gonna stop doing them
6198 2018-12-23 18:02:58 So I haven’t done oil painting since my classes in college, where we had fire-proof containers for used rags and containers to dump old turpenoid/solvent into. I’d like to eventually get back into oils, but what safety recommendations do you guys have? (1/2)
6199 2018-12-23 18:02:51 Dear @OfficialPDPNig, Tell Nigerians what you did with oil money for 16 years?
6200 2018-12-23 18:02:50 Or, indeed, Olbas Oil. #victormeldrew
6201 2018-12-23 18:02:39 EU wouldn't let us in until we got oil and gas via North Sea. Greenland and UK tried to join. EU rebuffed both then passed reg meaning whole of member states sea belong to EU. Greenland stopped app and stayed out. We joined and lost fishing industry. They tried it with oil.
6202 2018-12-23 18:02:22 No wonder you can’t spell ingenuity coz you think corruption, thievery, externalization, tax evasion r transfer pricing are inguiniety. We shouldn’t wonder why Zimbabweans can’t even produce their own cooking oil coz illiterates think fraud, theft & criminality is ingenuity
6203 2018-12-23 18:02:21 Yes but..its made from Saudi oil and American coal...so its ok and environment friendly and been through a gender based lens..
6204 2018-12-23 18:02:11 Lucas Oil is packed!!!!
6205 2018-12-23 18:02:10 For fuel the technology to process it has grown quite advanced.
Its easier and cheaper to make, yet the cost fluctuates dramatically.
The sudden hike in price before a holiday.
Why?
Because suddenly it became harder to make?
Or because "Big" oil wants to profit.

6207 2018-12-23 18:01:32 I’m thinking BIGGER agenda. We’re pulling out of conflict zones that contain oil, poppyseeds, and opium... you don’t have to be a genius to see the much larger picture. Politicians that have been baffling pockets off these locales for decades are about to lose money big money!
6208 2018-12-23 18:01:31 The problem isn't the traditional villages though is it - the problem is a human population of 7 BILLION and growing, billions of whom are eating more & more meat, which requires more land, more oil, more energy. Do you think eating meat as much as we do now is sustainable?
6209 2018-12-23 18:01:19 My moms loving that CBD MCT oil I made her  instant relief of chronic pain, and keeps her blood pressure low  it works wonders! #WakeUp
6210 2018-12-23 18:01:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however flourish here.
6211 2018-12-23 18:01:08 Let's play a game called what other team apparel have I seen worn at Lucas Oil today. So far we have Titans, Seahawks, and Packers stuff being worn.
6212 2018-12-23 18:01:03 So I had a dream... I was an investigative reporter producing a #podcast about a northern Montana oil company earning $581 billion annually as a non-profit organization. Is that normal?  #podcasting
6213 2018-12-23 18:00:51 I dont get sore knockers thankfully any more. But pre hysterectomy i couldnt walk down the stairs without them hurting pre period. Oil of evening primrose really helped me woth that!
6214 2018-12-23 18:00:43 Does everyone else find car manuals useless too? I don’t need to know the type of oil needed in all 174 variants of my car, just in the one I have.

6217 2018-12-23 18:00:19 Oil should be the least of your concerns.
6218 2018-12-23 18:00:16 Be nice if you supported buying local -i.e. Canadian- oil.
Vacuous twit
6219 2018-12-23 18:00:12 Sir ji dhanda without oil this timex you're making huge fan club! More power to you Good luck!
6220 2018-12-23 17:59:53 Armoured turnips are an ACA classic.

Another goody is onion and garlic slow roasted in wine, olive oil,  and spice (from Apicus)
6221 2018-12-23 17:59:53 Lucas Oil is so ugly
6222 2018-12-23 17:59:39 I actually know my facts on oil quite well.  That you don’t agree w it doesn’t make it wrong.
6223 2018-12-23 17:59:37 we had to call an ambulance for a kid who had to have been in middle school bc his parents didn’t tell us he was allergic to nuts. he had the calamari and started showing shock symptoms and THEN they decided to ask if it was fried in peanut oil. your kid is allergic
6224 2018-12-23 17:59:28 Tip... soaring lamps seem to have a (temporary?) affect against daytime apparitions. Talk about "putting some light on the subject"... though I'd strongly advise against choosing any oil lamps one may have (good thing THAT wasn't near)... end this cursed sun and hurry back night.
6225 2018-12-23 17:59:20 Haven't started working but the rice and oil no need lmao. What if I only eat basmati ? Convert and give them the money plz
6226 2018-12-23 17:59:09 Propaganda? By Stats Can? The oil isn’t running out anytime soon and by then we’ll be green. But right now it’s too expensive to simply go full throttle. And yes, our oil companies use the best technology to extract oil.  So why wouldn’t we use our own, instead of importing?

6231 2018-12-23 17:58:12 Isn't olive oil supposed to be in dark bottles so the light doesn't damage the quality 
6232 2018-12-23 17:58:01 I know I say this a lot, but it’s hard to overstate how much more electric the atmosphere is in Lucas Oil this year. Hell, even from the beginning of the season.

6236 2018-12-23 17:57:06 Same guys that work on oil rigs, to pull more oil, to roll more coal.  Sounds like that #Cocaine psa
6237 2018-12-23 17:57:04 LMAOOOOOOOOOOO. You dey find oil?
6238 2018-12-23 17:56:58 You should have...

- Travel size perfume 

- Pocket folding hairbrush 

- Makeup for touch ups

6241 2018-12-23 17:56:37 United States is now the largest oil producer in the world, surpassing Russia & Saudi Arabia. 
6242 2018-12-23 17:56:27 The ExecutiveOrderSanctions were instituted for US national interest. I don’t think they really care about white people but the interests of the US industrial military complex & big oil. All they want is to impoverish Zim to control strategicResources & ensure they get them cheap
6243 2018-12-23 17:55:55 Grumpy old man time

"Unsung heroes working Christmas"

Fook off, for many it's just another day. There are loads that "volunteer" for Christmas cos of the extra funds

And

What about all those "not heroes"

Shop workers
Taxi drivers 
Oil workers
Airport staff

Huh
6244 2018-12-23 17:55:49 I used to use coconut oil all the time. I’ve literally cut down to pure water and a pH balanced cleanser! I always react to body shop 
6245 2018-12-23 17:55:46 Do you know where I can buy a bow flex sx13000 with extra oil ?

6247 2018-12-23 17:55:28 Exactly... that’s literally being ready to buy a Mclaren and then trying to complain about the cost of an oil change 
6248 2018-12-23 17:55:28 What will Niger deltans whose land crude oil is sucked from say?
6249 2018-12-23 17:55:24 You know if the pipeline gets built Canadians would end up paying more for gas right? Currently oil companies have to sell the oil at a discount to Canada and US. The pipeline would give access to world market allowing oil companies to jack up prices.
6250 2018-12-23 17:55:14 Yes very sad  people don’t read anything about the carbon tax issue in Canada. Our emissions are 1.6%. If we stopped using oil products today it would make a difference. It is China, Pakistan, India that put 20% is carbon output
6251 2018-12-23 17:55:13 jojoba oil is fucking amazing for fighting hair frizz, but it’s CHEAP and it’s EASY. 

just a few drops in your palm, rub your hands together, and distribute the oil through your hair with light, swiping motions.
6252 2018-12-23 17:55:09 Just imagine what he/she needs it for!!! Meanwhile a woman in my area got little above that in support for her 30litr fuel/engine oil selling at the junction, she came to thank me that she make 1.5k every evening of fuel sales. Made 8k in 6days of turning 7k over!!
6253 2018-12-23 17:55:07 Russia is a net exporter of oil, so is the USA
6254 2018-12-23 17:54:57 Your warmongering privilege is showing. Thanks for putting it on the open, so there are no doubts you side w/waging an illegal war for profit & Big Oil and don't care about killing innocents & our troops. Most Americans don't want war. You're disgusting & immoral!
6255 2018-12-23 17:54:54 Oil
6256 2018-12-23 17:54:40 To quote myself:
We've been fighting wars for oil for decades. It was taken up a notch when Bush/Cheney took us into Iraq using 911 & WMDs as an excuse to go after the oil. See how well that worked out for us. A lot of Americans died & are still dying while the 1% get richer.
6257 2018-12-23 17:54:30 We aren't the police of the world.  We are more like the Sylvio & Pauley Walnuts for Wall St. bankers, oil companies, sweatshop & plantation owners that keep the peasants in line.
6258 2018-12-23 17:54:21 My dad took my car in for an oil change and turns out I have like 5+ things wrong with it. I’m going to get my ASS CHEWED /:
6259 2018-12-23 17:54:19 Who says that oil disasters don’t occur. Must be the oil companies! They are or should be 100% percent responsible for clean up bill. Not against the building of pipelines but am for those companies to be 100% responsible for every penny of any disaster that may occur.
6260 2018-12-23 17:54:19 This is amazing, but my mind keeps correlating this to the palm oil industry, and how destructive to the environment and the orangutans.
6261 2018-12-23 17:54:00 Doing adult responsibilities and getting an oil change even tho I have work in one hour enjsksks
6262 2018-12-23 17:53:54 Chloe, all these cleansers are awful for your skin. Use coconut oil or the chalomile cleanser balm from body shop amd just use hot then cold water and get the aloe vera with tea tree from holland and barret. Does wonders for me
6263 2018-12-23 17:53:48 Really? The movement is because so many people are out of work. Of course there was no movement when oil prices were high. Stop being ridiculous. And IF the government can help get the oil to the east coast, perhaps someone would step up. Nobody is gonna until then though
6264 2018-12-23 17:53:26 Oil burning steam locomotives with them fancy steam atomizers are vaping
6265 2018-12-23 17:53:08 Vixen Oil is always a win
6266 2018-12-23 17:53:04 Let’s be clear, oil is responsible for where Alberta is at. Our total and utter reliance on it and the vulnerability to OPEC price fixing. There is no magical conspiracy, it was a lack of planning on behalf of conservative governments in this province.
6267 2018-12-23 17:52:59 That's not all. Soy products act like estrogen. They're saying soybean oil is breast cancer food.
6268 2018-12-23 17:52:53 You do not grasp the concept of an energy unit of account, and the objective nature of energy cost. There is no such thing as gold cost: gold is priced in oil, but oil is not priced in gold.
6269 2018-12-23 17:52:48 Oh nevermind, they've got oil, and we sanctioned them.
6270 2018-12-23 17:52:37 Dorchester Minerals is investment co. Sanchez Oil & Gas does property mgmt. BP & Shell both have renewable/wind divisions, do you know which this exec of? Have friends who work at Schlumberger, it’s down the road from me. It’s a technology co. Guess you don’t know so much, huh?
6271 2018-12-23 17:52:36 Oh I dunno, honours Algebra in high school? Sorry, missed adding that to my profile. Oil resources are finite. The damage their extraction does to the environment..? I’m sorry your province is a one-trick pony bent over backwards for foreign profit.
6272 2018-12-23 17:52:33 Digging into Leek and Potato soup recipes. As you do. So simple, but so varied. Butter or veg oil or olive oil? Onions? Sweat the veg first in the fat, or just boil them, adding (butter) when serving? Ratios? Greener bits? Blend or finely slice first?
6273 2018-12-23 17:52:33 I’m flashing back to this “very mature” man sensually rubbing oil on a potato.
6274 2018-12-23 17:52:24 I am roasting the vegetables in rosemary. 
And oil of course. Obviously. *duh*
6275 2018-12-23 17:52:23 He just wanted all of the Park Rangers to be laid off for a bit so they aren't around to pester the oil prospectors.
6276 2018-12-23 17:52:20 We expect these MPs to be burning the midnight oil to find a solution to the economic pickle that the country is in. Alas, it's nothing but a Punch & Judy show, a poorly chorographed one for that matter. You would be forgiven for thinking they got into cabinet on a quota system.
6277 2018-12-23 17:52:19 Honey, we've been fighting wars for oil for decades. It was taken up a notch when Bush/Cheney took us into Iraq using 911 & WMDs as an excuse to go after the oil. See how well that worked out for us. A lot of Americans died & are still dying while the 1% get richer & richer.
6278 2018-12-23 17:52:00 My oil pan heater in my T800 is only 150w. Kinda small to do much good in weather colder than -20C.
6279 2018-12-23 17:52:00 If we use alternative power sources we don’t need to ship any oil & people can just get a different job. Lots of us have jobs change in life, me included. It’s not impossible, it’s important for preserving the environment.
6280 2018-12-23 17:51:59 right, i can do bare minimum including changing a tire and checking the oil (i even changed oil once or twice) but hello the car will die and burn up if u don't keep the engine lubricated. humans are 3/4ths water....HOW DO U NOT DRINK WATER??!?!?!
6281 2018-12-23 17:51:57 Article states’Trump Admin. prioritize protecting an oil rich ally over humanitarian concerns’. Killing a person is bad, but where was WPost when BHO’s fave Iran was ruthlessly killing 1,000’s in Green Revolution? Planning to send $150,000,000,000 in gold, Swiss Francs #hypocrisy
6282 2018-12-23 17:51:39 Buddy, even your ignorant base is beginning to get this border scam is more of you selling snake oil.
6283 2018-12-23 17:51:38 White lines at NE and SE (marked with ?) are most pribably floating pumice carried away by the waves (same as oil spills). The large anomaly looks more like an atmospheric plume than something on the sea surface (should have been affected by sea currents)
6284 2018-12-23 17:51:33 C'mon! They need to get that cheap oil to market in order to further depress the global price of oil!
6285 2018-12-23 17:51:29 And I suppose it has NOTHING to do with the slump in oil. Yet you continue to WHORE La out to oil companies rather than investing in renewable energy jobs.
6286 2018-12-23 17:51:25 Toothpaste is now toothbrush oil
6287 2018-12-23 17:51:19 It's bigger than big oil. Continue researching. #ClubOfRome #GeoEngineering #Agenda2030 #Eugenics. Build the puzzle and reconcile. Oligarchical big money has been behind the control of resources for generations. Ocasio Cortez is a pawn. She works for them.
6288 2018-12-23 17:51:14 @arvindsubraman sir I want to know about the meaning which write in your book the counsil when say about reduction of kerosene oil and pds food so it gain state and PDS shop how,
6289 2018-12-23 17:51:05 Then go buy one, give up your phone, your iPad and all the other products made with oil and gas. Have fun using your electric car at -40
6290 2018-12-23 17:51:04 Did it raise global oil prices? No?
6291 2018-12-23 17:51:01 That’s that fresh filter new oil chicken wings
6292 2018-12-23 17:50:47 This all the messe pmb inherited from ur collosal party for good sixteen years ur nonsense party can not account for moeny of cruel oil sold out by them is a pity,so oga Reno stop complain about hunger or no hunger is cause by ur party.
6293 2018-12-23 17:50:23 Obama was no pacifist. He set the record for most bombs dropped by any president in our nation’s history not to mention paved the road for trump to pick up where he left off. He signed off to murder millions of innocent people so that the war hawks would shut up and oil
6294 2018-12-23 17:50:23 any country with its own large source of oil would have won because Romania’s oil fields were inadequate for providing Germany’s great needs
6295 2018-12-23 17:50:22 about jungkook's pancakes it looked so satisfyingly perfect
he made sure all sides got into oil
ugh this is so pleasing to see as a cooking lover
6296 2018-12-23 17:50:16 Gas prices are likely to continue to decrease without an abrupt rebound. Losses in the stock market this past week were reported to be a result of the effect of lower oil and gas prices. OMG it takes heading to depression for this to happen.
6297 2018-12-23 17:50:13 Sugar and ground almonds flavoured with almond extract/oil. Old fashioned sweet.

6299 2018-12-23 17:50:03 The erratic and impulsive behavior by presidents was in the past when they sent our troops to wars that lasted more then 10 years like Vietnam and 17 years in the middle east with thousands of our kids killed and Trillions of dollars spent to Protect Dictators and big oil ..
6300 2018-12-23 17:49:59 No I would not, For the same reason I don’t want to know oil derrick in my backyard either
6301 2018-12-23 17:49:52 Oil extraction all over, untreated oil wast dumped in the ground, dirtiest air in USA, water extraction for export almonds up DURING the drought, Delta tunnels to rip off anything left. Yep. Heckuva job, Brownie!
6302 2018-12-23 17:49:49 "economically tyrannical "
Hmmm... I guess that includes extending EI benefits to Albertans, backdating them 9 months, buying a pipeline when KM was going to walk away (& then you never would have gotten the new pipeline, and approving $1.6B for assistance for oil companies.
6303 2018-12-23 17:49:39 Getting my oil leaks out the way so I can swing my shit without any worries
6304 2018-12-23 17:49:21 Yeah I will. Thanks. The oil gives a crisper finish btw. And some shine.

6319 2018-12-23 17:47:28 what the fuck is wrong with these assholes in the white house?  none of this oil even stays in the states for starters!
6320 2018-12-23 17:47:14 It's not lying just bc you don't want to hear it! IDGAF whether or not he's better than Ted Cruz. We're not talking about a Senate race anymore, but a national contest for pres. HRC had no problems telling W Virginians coal  needs to die- would O'Rourke say same about oil?
6321 2018-12-23 17:47:11 me: makes peace w russia

me: sees they have oil 
me: ITS FREEDOM TIME BOYS
6322 2018-12-23 17:47:08 what did I do before CBD oil
6323 2018-12-23 17:46:57 If Trudeau wants to help the Oil and Gas industry confidence immediately and perhaps slow investment from leaving Canada he would immediately Kill Bills C69 and C48.
6324 2018-12-23 17:46:40 This is akin to me saying set Gold/oil ratio to say ~400 bbls per oz and then letting each country decide how expensive they want oil to be based on how expensive they let gold be in their currency
6325 2018-12-23 17:46:35 which essential oil will fix my credit
6326 2018-12-23 17:46:33 It’s funny that’s when you go get your oil changed one person tells you all the things you need you pass then when you come back they tell you everything is fine except one thing
6327 2018-12-23 17:46:32 There are sex workers on Twitter begging people to buy them $140 CBD oil....? Because they don’t have the money? Ok so you’re not a very good sex worker? Or?
6328 2018-12-23 17:46:31 Mmmm......Had an interesting couple of days Oil smell from boiler. fan & cistern in bedroom no. 3 causing problems & today blocked kitchen sink. Maybe an interesting Christmas!!!! 
6329 2018-12-23 17:46:21 My brother asked me to help change the oil in his truck the other day. I replied right away. I texted him asking what time he was going to our family Xmas party. He never replied nor did he show up. Guess who's gonna be changing his own oil?
6330 2018-12-23 17:46:18 Any relation to Brett Kemp from the Oil Kings?
6331 2018-12-23 17:46:14 We Oil fans have suffered enough
6332 2018-12-23 17:45:55 What is this oil you ladies now rub on your faces before standing under the sun to take a picture
6333 2018-12-23 17:45:46 Blend 11 lbs cereal with 1 cup hash browns. Blend with Olive Oil. Squeeze out excess liquid Serve
6334 2018-12-23 17:45:42 Swap the oil for melted butter with brownie mix. Way better. 
6335 2018-12-23 17:45:27 Interest rates are at historic lows, the TMX pipeline moves 300,000 barrels of oil to market every day, and there is a great deal more than gender politics. Perhaps you should pay more attention to what is going on, and spend less time nursing your performative outrage.
6336 2018-12-23 17:45:26 Vitamin E oil
6337 2018-12-23 17:45:22  Castor oil for the drinkers.
6338 2018-12-23 17:45:16 closed down the oil sands driven away investors and has made us look like fools on the world stage. He has worked against this country, her people & his policies that will have a long-lasting negative effect. I'd say that fits the definition.
6339 2018-12-23 17:45:06 At least you got your oil changed finally lol
6340 2018-12-23 17:44:57 The butter just brings fat to make it creamier. If you have some oil, that will work as a replacement. Also you could just roast the potatoes.
6341 2018-12-23 17:44:48 I have to get a oil change today , but it’s so cold outside
6342 2018-12-23 17:44:44 Yep , my wife will be getting 1 litre of Engine  oil n some Spark plugs as usual !!
6343 2018-12-23 17:44:41 .Evangelicals are the worst. They're like bands of traveling gypsies trying to sell you snake oil.
6344 2018-12-23 17:44:38 Yep, the Democrats want high oil prices so their alternative energy donors can get government subsidies. 

SOLYNDRA
6345 2018-12-23 17:44:29 Butter and olive oil 50/50 split in a frying pan and slice them and fry until they go toffee coloured looking slightly well done. The natural sugar in the Plantain turns to toffee. Eat them warm with a spot of cream or ice cream. Absolutely delicious!
6346 2018-12-23 17:44:24 I swear I use a skillet, cropped up collards, a little water, olive oil, onions, garlic, red pepper and cook until tender and dry when I am in a hurry and want some greens. Tasty!
6347 2018-12-23 17:44:22 I'm starting to think the most popular early Christmas present in Indy this year is a blue 53 jersey. Seeing tons of those strolling into Lucas Oil today. 

Remember, that's what Chris Ballard wanted: Homegrown players becoming fan favorites.
6348 2018-12-23 17:44:20 I made mine with too much flour for years. When I finally cut the flour they went mental. No need for oil in the batter, imho, think the eggs only get properly foamy whisking them first with a little salt. 

Have a go if you're seeking the holy grail of yorkshires. They're huge.
6349 2018-12-23 17:44:07 I promise ain’t a oil spill slicker
6350 2018-12-23 17:44:04 GreenNH3 (30 ¢/L) and zero carbon. Reason JT does not reply is he will lose gas tax and b seen as guy who hurt CAN oil business. What he dosent see is it will take 10 years 4 us to make dent in oil. Pls contact us + we can do some remote electric grids <10¢/kw in meantime
6351 2018-12-23 17:44:02 The US military & oil ccy has a lot to do w/ it. And up until 08, it was still mostly Wall St that was selling "reserves" in MBS et al. It's only after 08 that US govt debt became THE reserve. The Bush deficits were just seen as any other backsliding govt before 08
6352 2018-12-23 17:43:36 put olive oil in my ear bc it's been blocked for days but now it's just blocked up with oil instead of wax
6353 2018-12-23 17:43:30 Wrap it, oil it , Saran Wrap it and then sit under the dryer for 20-30 mins! Twist it off and then flat iron! Works for me!
6354 2018-12-23 17:43:14 DARK to LIGHT
THINK cabal
WHAT if Syrias ports was needed 
THINK EU
WHAT if Assaud stood in way
THINK ISIS
WHAT if u used excuse to illegally go into Syria after a group u birthed
THINK Qatar
WHAT if war about oil
THINK troopsplan collapses 
THINK Trump drainswamp
6355 2018-12-23 17:43:03 Lastly, it's an oversimplification to say that our oil sands projects are not profitable. We have world leading extraction technologies and reclamation processes. There are massive governmental tax burdens in play, not just to industry but to all citizens.
6356 2018-12-23 17:42:51 The last time I seen wrestlers having long hair was at a bar where 2 women were oil wrestling
6357 2018-12-23 17:42:50 Is it a bad or a good thing that the people at the Oil and Vinegar store in the Strip know who I am?
6358 2018-12-23 17:42:48 Yea thats what i do, but when i get gifted edible oil or butter its always bitter or grassy. I make mine using simple methods and i filter out the grassy n bitter notes just seems the "old school" guys that gift it to me just dont care. Then again these guys have never seen a dab
6359 2018-12-23 17:42:48 Rosehip oil is a miracle!!!
6360 2018-12-23 17:42:48 Sana oil, hanap moq ebeb
6361 2018-12-23 17:42:28 Go buy some organic oil of oregano.  Couple drops every 5 hours. Works like a charm. It is very strong so take with water. The best thing for any bacteria or virus!
6362 2018-12-23 17:42:11 i'm still pissed that juul has sucked up so much of the money & attention re: vaping. it's like if k-cups were all laced with cocaine and motor oil and people used 'keurig' and 'coffee' interchangably
6363 2018-12-23 17:41:56 OMG, that is stunning!! That is definitely going to be my next oil painting. The colors are beautiful. As an Az-er, I have seen some pretty extraordinary sunsets and sunrises, but this photo is particularly magnificent.  Thanks for posting!
6364 2018-12-23 17:41:42 Was it the demo crew, some sentimental technicians, or just their creature shop that did it wrong and didn't want to report the oil spill? And like, what was the motive?!?
6365 2018-12-23 17:41:29 Hears a thought what if tomorrow it was discovered that heaven and hell are real and that the entire time we have bin digging up coal anbmd pumping oil we have in fact bin cleaning out the devils septic tank
6366 2018-12-23 17:41:27 Only ignorance will make you expect diversification in a few years of a country dependent on crude oil for over 50 years. If we ask for a blueprint of the party your want to vote you'd most likely draw a blank. The question is are we on the path or in the opposite direction?
6367 2018-12-23 17:41:26 Sunflower oil, seasoning salt, black pepper, rosemary, basil, minced garlic, and any other herbs you like (say, marjoram). Toss it all in a big bowl, lay out flat on a cookie sheet, bake at 450 for 20-40 min depending on your preference for crispness. Win dinner. Profit.

Mayor Helps wants oil money for climate change, but forgets she is the facilitator.  Prompting cruise ships and whale watching terrorism. The mayor is enabling 2 out of the 3 things with decline of the Orcas. Just keep dumping sewage.

6375 2018-12-23 17:40:49 Back when I was really fat, right before I would ever go out and get fast food I would watch Reviewbrah to hype myself up
6376 2018-12-23 17:40:44 Use new mediums;
-Clay
-Pastels
-Coloured pencils
-Oil, acrylic, water coloured paint.
(if you already paint w acrylics or oils, you can try painting on something different like wood & things made out of wood- you can find these at your local craft store)
6377 2018-12-23 17:40:43 Just spent more on shit for an oil change than I normally do on groceries for the week, I take better care of my car than I do myself
6378 2018-12-23 17:40:32 *fire up google’
ta, I wondered what to use. 
salt water or tea tree oil just didn’t feel right 
6379 2018-12-23 17:40:29 美少年は今日も可愛いなー！
6380 2018-12-23 17:40:22 Ah. I use 400 milk, 4 eggs, 250 flour, dash oil, mustard powder and salt. 

That makes 20 of mine.
6381 2018-12-23 17:40:17 Ah here,  and they think they could control the border with technology. Was that an oil tanker went by ?, no an ice cream van I think
6382 2018-12-23 17:40:14 Like i clearly didnt drop my car off for an oil change... tf wrong w/me mane
6383 2018-12-23 17:40:12 We should bomb all the pipelines in the middle East before the world is destroyed in oil and it's plastic.
6384 2018-12-23 17:40:10 Is that what the oil is called?
6385 2018-12-23 17:40:09 Endless oil story
6386 2018-12-23 17:39:59 All the things you mention can be supported by electricity. With possible exception of flying.
And "our oil" is crap that needs Super Refining. and if its so valuable why do we not have enough of our own refineries to produce it? But JT is supposed to fix it overnight.
6387 2018-12-23 17:39:54 Bible says "Anger rests in the bosom of fools".

They keep anger close to their chest. Anger is their "go-to".

Anger fuels them, drives them, reminds them they are alive.

Not work, not preparation, not skill, not study, ANGER, jealousy, envy.

Thats their motor oil. OR IS IT?

6391 2018-12-23 17:38:53 Are you saying that UNC sees oil in its future?
6392 2018-12-23 17:38:37 430ml whole milk, 4 eggs, 150g flour. That's the perfect amount for 2 deep 6 hole muffin tins, dessertspoon of oil in each hole. Electric whisk is a must. Heat the milk to just warm. The mix is fine to stand until ready to cook with it, but no need. Stir it well before pouring.
6393 2018-12-23 17:38:34 Blackwater was the Bushes private army but the GOP still has ties to them. So does big oil.
6394 2018-12-23 17:38:32 To recap: The Nazis controlled Germany through invasive regulations. Trump is removing regulations. Russia gets 3/4 of its revenue from petroleum products. Trump's support for oil extraction has depressed the prices of petroleum products.

Try harder, sweetie.
6395 2018-12-23 17:38:28 Most industries (and yes, legacy car makers as well) are living off subsidies and bail outs, e.g., farm subsidies, oil subsidies,...
There are many, many more with a higher amount of money than what Tesla gets.
SpaceX gets money for services rendered, but, yes, give it to Russia.
6396 2018-12-23 17:37:56 I used to play Golf, Tennis, Basketball, Roller Hockey, Volleyball, cooked my own food, worked on my own car (from Oil Changes, to changing clutches and even an engine swap), I used to work out everyday and was very fit, healthy and attractive, I actually got an A in university.
6397 2018-12-23 17:37:56 I generally don’t go much above a medium heat, unless it’s a weaker hot sauce. I’ll try sauces, but I could never eat an entire wing(s) or anything. I get Dan Dan noodles that have a little chili oil in it and sometimes even that’s too hot.
6398 2018-12-23 17:37:47 And you want us to fight wars for the oil companies? O.o
6399 2018-12-23 17:37:45 It’s just me, myself, and this bottle of vitamin E oil........
6400 2018-12-23 17:37:42 Curious about concentrates? Don't know how to dab? Come in to Nectar on 122nd ave & chat with a friendly budtender about our oil options
6401 2018-12-23 17:37:34 The government doesn't have to control oil prices, but they can help get the oil to tides a it can be sold on equal ground with other countries, and just because racists are using this as a platform it doesn't mean everyone involved is. Some are just honest working people
6402 2018-12-23 17:37:18 Did they strip and oil him next put him up on the auction block for the college wrestling teams to bid! His work study job could be on the school's weed plantation.

6406 2018-12-23 17:36:49 I have a colleague who’s 3 month old is going in for emerg surgery tomorrow. Huge oil fan. Looking to get a message of support to him from someone in the org. @KellyHrudey @CassieCampbell @EricFrancis
6407 2018-12-23 17:36:48 Developing the oil, since we are a resource-based country, really is the best option to keep people working and food on the table to feed their families. What’s hilarious are voters like you who want a welfare state, or handouts!
6408 2018-12-23 17:36:47 Also note the sweet deal the west esp usa got in this. They print paper $ hand them to oilsheikhs for real oil. Who then have to invest the money back in the west, where it can be lent to industries and pay for gov spending. That game is up soon.
6409 2018-12-23 17:36:46 And boiling oil! We'll pour it down on them! That'll show those coyotes!
6410 2018-12-23 17:36:35 Do you think at some point oil resources will become nationalized? At some point there is a limit and the only way to manage limited resources like oil is to manage demand or limit supply. What should the long term strategy be? Save oil for highest and best use?
6411 2018-12-23 17:36:34 @realDonaldTrump didn't call for war's end. He called for a withdrawal of troops for Putin. He cleared the way so Russia has no obstacles in their plan to push into the Middle East to get at the oil. This move confirms Russia's hold over Trump. Putin & his state are thrilled.

6413 2018-12-23 17:36:29 water based oil paint sounds so bad on a chemical level, also can't you just use alcohol for cleaning?
6414 2018-12-23 17:36:19 Let's say you are dressing up a lemon box cake. Use 4 eggs, 1 package of lemon or cheesecake pudding, 1 cup sour cream & 1/2 cup of butter or oil. If you really want to be snazzy you can also throw in a splash of extract
6415 2018-12-23 17:36:10 “Our oil is in the oil sands of Alberta. Don't be ashamed of it. Our oil is not only "ethical," as compared with the dictatorship variety, it is also no more emissions-intensive than a full 45 per cent of feedstocks the U.S. uses, bought from the likes of Venezuela and Mexico.”
6416 2018-12-23 17:36:03 I need it to gift Mama wey lost her groundnut oil... 
6417 2018-12-23 17:36:01 If we could get more oil to west and east coast load outs and onto tankers for worldwide markets we could afford many things you want like the stc but since the feds are killing our oil industry we cant find all the socialism projects the libtards and NDP want

6419 2018-12-23 17:35:58 Well, we went down there wearing blue and out chanted the Yellow Vest people and our chant was "No Hate no Fear Refugees are Welcome here!".

6421 2018-12-23 17:35:52 Should be good for 6k or more with synthetic oil.
6422 2018-12-23 17:35:48 The most ridiculous aspect is that climate change research-wise the oil companies were well ahead of the curve in the 70s/80s, but instead of reinventing themselves as diverse *energy* companies they chose to double-down on oil and take the tobacco approach instead.
6423 2018-12-23 17:35:40 So, errm.. if you took a bath in olive oil you'd absorb it all and become immensely fat? Bit like a sponge?
6424 2018-12-23 17:35:37 The health insurance, prescription drug, defense, and oil industries all face serious loss of profit or even complete liquidation of their businesses under a Sanders presidency and a progressive congressional majority. +
6425 2018-12-23 17:35:35 Look lady. I don't work in the oilfield first of all. Secondly I hope I'm never as heartless as you to look upon people having hard times and say find another line of work. And lastly our oil once it's refined is as clean as any oil around. I assume you don't use any oil at all
6426 2018-12-23 17:35:20 omg  that is not true, but for breakage try deep conditioning more, hot oil treatments & keeping your ends moisturized

6430 2018-12-23 17:35:02 It came from people. Oil and gas is the biggest industry in Texas. You can keep lying all you want but it doesn't change the fact that corporations favored Ted Cruz.
6431 2018-12-23 17:34:44 Mr. Prime minister are you aware that more people die in oil sector accidents then active military duty?  These fine folks provide fuel for our military and for you to jet around. So instead of shitting on Canadian oil how about support it over Saudi blood oil you import. #OOTT
6432 2018-12-23 17:34:42 This body oil smells amazing!!
6433 2018-12-23 17:34:28 Sure you go right ahead. In a perfect world there would be some of each. If you supported oil and gas there would be tax dollars to develop alternative sources of energy

6437 2018-12-23 17:34:10 I ended up *not* going to the mall. Found everything I needed between Shoppers (our pharmacy) and one other store (for a paraben-free moisturizer/oil thing that Ashley asked specifically for)
6438 2018-12-23 17:34:02 @Tesco I am curious to know if you will be banning the use of palm oil in your own brand products anytime soon?
6439 2018-12-23 17:33:42 My dad was furious because now he actually has to work Christmas Day and his company was fined for him being late to bring his pressurized Gas to a fort Mac oil company. It’s completely non-productive. I’m sure many people have better things to do then have their travel blocked
6440 2018-12-23 17:33:41 Same here but I went to your old spot and you weren't there! That said are you in Lucas Oil Stadium now?
6441 2018-12-23 17:33:39 2, ... and we know what happened in Maidan etc. US caused entire mess in Ukraine. US f****d up Ukraine. This was all about gaining access to oil, gas in Black sea. Hunter Biden sits on an energy board based in Kiev. Does any more need to be said?

But sure, what we need is a Yes Man SecDef.

6457 2018-12-23 17:31:44 Maybe .@realDonaldTrump would to put pots of boiling oil on top of the wall too!
6458 2018-12-23 17:31:40 Pursuing “not-GREEN” energy: ask HOW MUCH fossil fuel required to produce one GREEN-energy vehicle?  [gas used to produce electricity, gas furnaces to melt plastics/metals, petroleum by-products for composites and adhesives, huge oil/gas to mine nickle, lithium, silver, etc ]
6459 2018-12-23 17:31:30 Shine the tires, vacuum, and change the oil too
6460 2018-12-23 17:31:30 Also we always play without oil money and the constant threats that UEFA always pays heed to because money is pouring in and football is a business now.

6462 2018-12-23 17:31:23 PEOPLE, WHAT DONT YOU GET ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING!  YOU’DE RATHER THE PLANET EXPLODE, JUST SO YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OIL MONEY!!! SHAME ON ALL OF YOU REPUBLICANS
6463 2018-12-23 17:31:13 Palm oil will only moisturize your skin it will prevent it from drying up.....Palm oil no fit cause anything for your face.
6464 2018-12-23 17:31:13 These rich ppl is buying the CBD oil...
6465 2018-12-23 17:31:00 Hehe, it’s the same situation with ‘gmo’ oil that I mentioned earlier. What I tried to say is that I would say it’s not ok when you lie about SDS (to lie about SDS of colchicine in this case. Not SDS of the fruit) The post doesn’t lie about SDS of watermelon either.
6466 2018-12-23 17:31:00 Oil=money=greed=corruption
6467 2018-12-23 17:30:57 Pffft. Bring it, Big Oil. It's different this time. The genie is out of the bottle...
6468 2018-12-23 17:30:50 Try surviving with no oil like the libtards and stupid NDP are pushing for. Just try
6469 2018-12-23 17:30:41 Yes, the eucalyptus oil is making it tingle and itch like mad! Worth it though...
6470 2018-12-23 17:30:40 You still have the snake oil in your system or you are seriously mentally challenged....
6471 2018-12-23 17:30:40 Lol it’s oil, they do that after to moisturize and so that in the pictures/videos, the nails will be shiny
6472 2018-12-23 17:30:34 Most software design that I have been involved with is neither designing a Maseraiti nor changing its oil, but rather designing a Pinto, or maybe a Honda Civic.  I really do believe that this guy's analogy breaks down with the Maserati/mechanic dichotomy.

6476 2018-12-23 17:30:02 20 mins late to work. Went over 15,000 miles for my oil change, and 49 miles to empty in my car. But at least my Bluetooth work
6477 2018-12-23 17:29:48 Sha ini kugadzirwa msoro with olive oil  35 mari eish ndakarwadziwa. ..this is the time where we should do half half nabae
6478 2018-12-23 17:29:46 Sesame seeds?! “Drizzle” olive oil? Do these people not know what what bacon grease, cracklings and filet gumbo are?
6479 2018-12-23 17:29:45 My dad was changing my oil and we look over and addi is standing in the oil pan. That’s full of oil 
6480 2018-12-23 17:29:34 2021 Democratic US President can declare natsec emergency 2 fully implement #Mission100 #GreenNewDeal + other #ClimateChange reforms by 2023.

Take Cuba+Venezuela oil+gas supplies in exchange 4 pootinrusher control of Syria+Rusukraine.

Oil market, opec cartel go down.
6481 2018-12-23 17:29:21 He was #1 recipient of donations from Oil & Gas sector in the House this year. How many of the $492,620 in fossil fuel cash came from oil field workers  as opposed to execs? How likely is he to buck the industry in favor of strong climate action? He gets lots of corporate $$!
6482 2018-12-23 17:29:10 So...he was sold some snake oil. Fitting.
6483 2018-12-23 17:29:00 "Pipeline opponents have tried to force investments in their preferred energy sources by preventing investments in oil and gas. While they have generated headlines, they have not stopped those fuels from getting to market, nor did their actions lead to increases in renewables."
6484 2018-12-23 17:28:51 Not endorsing capitalism or socialism but, you do realize the US has been screwing with their economy ever since Chavez started charging the US more for oil. Not an honest comparison
6485 2018-12-23 17:28:47 Pandering to oil workers again.
6486 2018-12-23 17:28:46 Science recognized the benefits since creation so they made concerted efforts to divert our attention away from them. We have propaganda research condemning palm oil, cocoa, maize, coffee, just to name a few. We also swallowed it whole without doing our counter homework . Lol
6487 2018-12-23 17:28:43 Yes, but he also said he would make the oil industry work - which of course was a ridiculous lie. He went down to Texas and made a fool of himself saying, Canada is open for business. His childish lies r catching up with him.
6488 2018-12-23 17:28:37 Sending healing thoughts your daughter's way.  Mine is 21-yrs-old & I've had to take her to the ER/urgent care at times, glad we have insurance.  I think her asthma was caused by fracking at the local oil field (just a few miles away & exacerbated by #AlisoCanyon emissions).
6489 2018-12-23 17:28:31 When soliciting sponsors to switch drunk tired revelers to transit on one of the bloodiest nights of the year, should they skip oil companies?

6491 2018-12-23 17:28:07 If the United States really want to hurt Russia with oil exports to Europe we can do that with no problem being the #1 oil exporter - that's not the issue. 

Wait 'till they start denying passage and we have to get involved again. It's going to take more than 2k troops to fix it.
6492 2018-12-23 17:28:02 Put your oil hands in velvet gloves.
6493 2018-12-23 17:27:57 Pass through Galaxy oil let me fill ur tank and join u
6494 2018-12-23 17:27:34 One of feds reasons for the earlier hikes was high energy cost and "threat" of inflation. Now no threat of recession, slowing world economy, lowest oil prices in over a year...
What was the excuse for this hike? Hatred of my President, America, ME?
6495 2018-12-23 17:27:33 Facts! I used this and olive oil massage
6496 2018-12-23 17:27:20 They presume you are not already well educated in physics and chemistry. When you show you are they retort that you are not a climate scientist. When you show you are a climate scientist (not me) they claim you are owned by big oil. When you prove this to be false they block you.
6497 2018-12-23 17:27:04 #BuyLocal is a great! Maybe you can pass this novel idea on to @gmbutts & @JustinTrudeau so we can get local #CanOil to the east instead of buying oil from places like Saudi, Iraq, Nigeria.
6498 2018-12-23 17:26:54 Great compound. I use rosehip oil in the Men’s Face Oil.
6499 2018-12-23 17:26:32 Man needs a serious 2 hour massage charley..a low lit room, full bucket of baby oil n jazz music..nothing else.. is duh too much to ask..
#Swgn #Dreamteam #Kokosuckers...
6500 2018-12-23 17:26:31 Trudeau could ban those imports in a heartbeat and Quebec can shut it's mouth to allow EE to be built to replace barbaric oil with Alberta oil until we can go green in a way that protects the poor.
6501 2018-12-23 17:26:22 I’m currently listening to Bled Dry. 3 hrs to go. It’s very tense.  I’m really hoping Oil Apocalypse 4&5 make it to audio book. A descendans book sounds ace. I’d also really like to listen to Gray #4, if it gets written 
6502 2018-12-23 17:26:19 it took 3 shampooings but my hair is recovered from my attempt at a diy hair mask (don't use olive oil if you don't have dry hair kids)
6503 2018-12-23 17:26:14 >(USSR) Lmao Which Americans, the dead ones? 
>(Burkina Fasco) You mean that country that had like two coups in a little over a decade? Very functional.
>(Libya) Not a really big claim to fame seeing as the region is a hellpit..also 'oil'
6504 2018-12-23 17:26:07 It rang 2 my ears tht we were no longer @ the mercy of othr oil producing countries.That we cld no longer b held hostage like in days past. & that maybe we hd a new barginng tool. Is that a possibility? Is it possible tht 1 thing can b good on 1 hand but negative on anothr front?
6505 2018-12-23 17:26:05 I am not for sure what is going on here - is anyone? Tuaregs have opened the oil fields in Fezzan but pipe lines go up to the coast, Tripolitania.  However NOC keeps saying fields are closed ? ! ?
6506 2018-12-23 17:25:37 I know my deceased Mom would not approve, but dug an old oil painting still life of mackerel and jug of wine out of my parents' attic and rehung the painting. Graced our family dining room for decades & my dad always liked it, but Mom got an upgrade w/ a gilded mirror in the 90s.

6508 2018-12-23 17:25:25 The hurt of the Persians invading (what is now claimed by Israel) some 2,500 years ago is unforgettable.  The present land of the Persians should be blasted and their oil resourcrs taken.
6509 2018-12-23 17:25:24 It’s not only common, but the norm in my industry Oil & Gas.  Engineers right out of university make $80,000 and in a couple of years make $100,000 or more.  Oil & Gas is the highest paying industry I know of for 4 year degree.
6510 2018-12-23 17:25:20 Not long ago Russia had to consider a nuclear war before even thinking to about stationing a tugboat in the warm waters of the Middle East. Not just of oil but the strategic defence of the West.
What they get for free today, tomorrow we have to get back with blood.
6511 2018-12-23 17:24:40 Oil demand hasn’t even peaked yet. It isn’t a dying commodity. I don’t understand why leftists are trying to get rid of the very jobs that feed the east
6512 2018-12-23 17:24:36 There was a carryover from another game. Doesn’t eastern Canada put a cap on their sales?
6513 2018-12-23 17:24:24 Word of advice, don’t chug a hot chocolate that has cbd oil in it as fast as you can
6514 2018-12-23 17:24:19 Yeah but we are talking about Pallone here who takes over a million in PAC money, and hundreds thousands from the oil and gas industry being put in charge of a committee on the industry. If this does not bother you I can't help you.
6515 2018-12-23 17:24:18 Always an oil rally when it sells off this hard and dollar drops! I'm getting back in to oil due to solid PEs, plus some good dividends. $XOM $BP $RDS.A $EQNR $CVX
6516 2018-12-23 17:24:18 Really you don’t have a job ? A huge part of the Alberta economy is based on spinoff jobs ... there are less dishwashers working in restaurants because rigs aren’t drilling for oil ...that’s as simple as I can say it ...period
6517 2018-12-23 17:24:10 @AyushyaP bhai ! your oil tanker company is from Neptune Kya !
6518 2018-12-23 17:24:03 Oil seems to trading with spx
6519 2018-12-23 17:24:03 .....Should’ve backed up the Lenti Olive Oil Co. truck to land Hurley, who was a Chicago legend in waiting.
6520 2018-12-23 17:23:48 Let me put this baby oil in a spray bottle real quick
6521 2018-12-23 17:23:47 Haha. Funny!
6522 2018-12-23 17:23:41 Iraq Oil Minister sees improvement in oil prices early next year: Iraq's oil minister said on Sunday he expects "an improvement" in oil prices at the beginning of next year, after the implementation of the OPEC and non-OPEC decision to curb production made earlier this month.

6525 2018-12-23 17:23:15 Nice.
Now we need to figure out how to scale it up to replace container ships that run on bunker oil.
6526 2018-12-23 17:22:53 This is Big Oil's fault.  We need to stop the oil drilling which is removing the lubrication needed for the earth to revolve smoothly around its axis.
6527 2018-12-23 17:22:52 16 points.  Draw with the oil boys
6528 2018-12-23 17:22:51 Hmm.. odd they're using an optical sensor in a gas unit.  Oil rigs are notorious for carbon fouling. Most gas units use a thermocouple  and run clean anyway.
6529 2018-12-23 17:22:46 Clove and oil of oregano would also be good in any of these home remedies and their flavors are strong enough to balance the garlic flavor
6530 2018-12-23 17:22:41 Tad bit of oil to keep them from sticking?
6531 2018-12-23 17:22:38 you mean the stuff on the fish? made a marinade for the fish and just threw it into the frying pan as well so it's just onions, glaric, olive oil, salt, black and red pepper and oleander. Or do you mean the red stuff? that's a pesto I made out of dried tomatoes :3c
6532 2018-12-23 17:22:29 You make Johnny & Carl look like they could do with a bit of cod liver oil to loosen up a bit 
6533 2018-12-23 17:22:23 I don’t watch @FoxNews, so I’m unaware of which snake oil the fake news is selling Americans today.
6534 2018-12-23 17:22:22 Lmao the oil bucket was the best still when he spilled oil outside the door 
6535 2018-12-23 17:22:19 They don’t want clean energy?  You don’t get oil and gas subsidies?
6536 2018-12-23 17:22:16 Scheer’s plan:
1) Hope the price of oil goes back up
2) Complain about “socialism” even though he has no idea what it is.
6537 2018-12-23 17:22:13 So may people from BC and the Maritimes work in the oil patch.  However not all will admit it.  Many of them don’t even have to spend a cent  in Alberta depending on where they work.  Time for them to step up and spread the word.
6538 2018-12-23 17:22:11 I wonder how #Israel will export gas to #Europe if #Greece and #Cyprus are having gas and oil in the #Aegean - who will sell what is the question
6539 2018-12-23 17:22:06 He doesn't take oil and gas money corporate money, that is a complete lie. I have a mid level job at a casino, if I donate to him it doesn't mean he takes big gambling money. People aren't corporations.
6540 2018-12-23 17:22:03 Man fuck that guy. Enough oil in his hair to start a war with the US

6542 2018-12-23 17:21:46 Can I put baby oil on you and take videos of you twerking cause the world deserves
6543 2018-12-23 17:21:31 you can easily make a petra collins film by smudging an iphone camera lens with the oil from ur fingertip
6544 2018-12-23 17:21:14 My massage therapist fucks me up man my body is like when oil soldifies in cold & is a bit gross but alluring

6547 2018-12-23 17:20:53 It's a revolving line at low interest rates.  The interest payments to debtholders are largely spent within the country.  Your concern would be better focused on why Imperial Oil's tax rate is lower than a person making an average salary.

6549 2018-12-23 17:20:45 my favorite part was blaming Syrias' economic weaknesses pre-2011 entirely on Assad while ignoring the sanctions, decreased oil production,  and massive drought that wrecked its rural economy.
6550 2018-12-23 17:20:38 The Ingredients are 1 Cup Flour, 2 Tablespoons Sugar, 1 Tablespoon Baking Powder, 2 Tablespoons Loya Milk, 1 Egg, 3/4 Cup Water, Vegetable Oil,  Chocolate Chips #MerryWithLoya
6551 2018-12-23 17:20:34 I post meals on here and on insta (myplantbasedrecovery), but i’m hclf and oil free and I exercise MOSTLY on the daily, lotsa carbs n fruit n veg 
6552 2018-12-23 17:20:32 I love it! It's absolutely beautiful.  I applaud your dedication to oil painting!
6553 2018-12-23 17:20:26 That's why the stop production when the oil futures are at $40 a barrel. I haven't seen any oil companies declaring bankruptcy recently. $63 a barrel is a healthy rate for companies and consumers.
6554 2018-12-23 17:20:25 Because they are lying... @realDonaldTrump Hemp production readily produces small buds roughly as strong as really cheap 40-25 USD/OZ cannabis/pot/weed/smoke - ahem - hemp from Mexico fifty+ years ago.  Persuade all Central/South American+ oil production to CUT BACK ~ @Repub_News
6555 2018-12-23 17:20:17 That’s horse crap. Obama was bombing open fields and empty buildings. He wouldn’t bomb their oil supply trains (their entire source of revenue) cuz he didn’t want to hurt the environment.

6557 2018-12-23 17:19:52 Exciting possibilities yes, but have we ever been in or started a recession while oil prices this low in relative terms? I don't know. In any event, I believe future still very bright in crypto regardless. Thanks! 
6558 2018-12-23 17:19:50 Still you can't define or articulate what that means.
Also if billionaires were hoarding ( define that too)
Where did your Twitter machine evolve? Cars? The oil to run said vehicles.  To include busses, planes.
I presume if given a billion you would refuse as to not be a scumbag?
6559 2018-12-23 17:19:49 I would recommend a cbd edible to start off or the cbd oils are amazing and help you within. I’ve tried the cbd oil and they’re definitely effective!!! Cbd ALIVE 20:1 Cbd/thc is award winning. So is Papa & Barkley 1:1 CBD/THCA.

6568 2018-12-23 17:19:04 Educate yourself!!  Quebec gets over half it’s total oil from Alberta and nearly all the rest from US. Irving on Coast is buying Saudi oil, a private company; not Quebec and not Trudeau. How can such ignorance be so common?
6569 2018-12-23 17:19:03 A quorum of the tensions in world today likely tied to the fact that Eurasia began forcing gold back onto the US back in 1999 (EUR w/its floating gold treatment followed shortly thereafter by Saddam pricing oil in EUR), & more recently China/Russia/EU gold buying & repatriation.
6570 2018-12-23 17:18:57 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
6571 2018-12-23 17:18:51 I went to my #Ottawa gas station. I wanted to purchase oil produced by hard working #Canadians but your government makes it impossible for us to get #AlbertaOil . Stuck purchasing oil from #SaudiArabia, #Liberia #Venezuela #TrudeauMustGo
6572 2018-12-23 17:18:51 If we want to have a significant impact on global GHG emissions Canada can become an oil and gas superpower and export our product around the world. We can then take this new found wealth and invest in sustainable alternatives. Bottom line is Canada wins and the world wins.
6573 2018-12-23 17:18:48 My hair sucks because if I wash it everyday it geta brittle but if I go a couple days w/o washing it, its like i poured canola oil straight into my hair. There is no happy medium. My hair hates me.
6574 2018-12-23 17:18:36 Typical rainwater is ~pH5.7-5.5. Near a coal or oil fired power plant, rain is often down to pH4.0. During the worst of the TVA emissions, our snow was pH3.0. Skin is normally about pH 4.5 - 5.5. Acids are not alike. HCL is not very dangerous but sulfuric acid is. Pepsi is pH 2.5
6575 2018-12-23 17:18:34 well, if we could go back in history and prevent the gulf oil spill, then we could have prevented the changes to the gulf stream.  it was those changes that are now causing europe to head right into an ice age.  go check it out. this was done deliberately.  by whom?

6584 2018-12-23 17:17:29 Bought oil fron Isis
6585 2018-12-23 17:17:22 hehehe uwu ganito po tayo kasipag. hehe burning the midnight oil!
6586 2018-12-23 17:17:09 Olive oil tossed with some pasta, grilled vegetables and chicken. Delicious. 
6587 2018-12-23 17:17:05 Wow, you’d think the weed would calm you down. 
What this guy is selling obviously doesn’t work
6588 2018-12-23 17:16:41 American interests a.k.a oil, money and war. Prove me wrong.
6589 2018-12-23 17:16:37 Hey, @AndrewScheer - where exactly is oil selling for $75 per barrel? #cndpoli
6590 2018-12-23 17:16:33 Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba separate and build a port near Churchill to ship oil to the east coast through the Hudson Bay.  Problem solved.
6591 2018-12-23 17:16:27 The coastal elites are hypnotising Fox News viewers with Druids to blow up offshore oil rigs.  #hollowearth
6592 2018-12-23 17:16:24 Getting an oil change with a toddler is toward the top of my “Hate To Do” list
6593 2018-12-23 17:16:22 I dont blame him, i blame the 2 months old bride. Wannan ai jahilci ne!
6594 2018-12-23 17:16:14 Just another never ending war guy. Let’s just stay in the Middle East forever or until the oil runs out. Wait how much oil does Syria have???
6595 2018-12-23 17:16:00 Congress fighting for higher oil price but didn't reduce tax in their ruling states why ,it's dual face of Congress which they show to different people of their choice @ RahulGandhi @BJP4India @News18India
6596 2018-12-23 17:16:00 These rallies have nothing to with oil. These people are bigots, racists, and homophobes.
6597 2018-12-23 17:15:37 I was suppose to do an oil change this morning
6598 2018-12-23 17:15:22 When my son was constipated my suegra cute a super small piece of soap and made it into a stick rubbed a bit of oil and stuck it up his butt to stimulate it so he can poop and it really works. Dont worry the soap doesnt stay stuck, they poop it out.
6599 2018-12-23 17:15:21 Agreed. Let’s buy LOCAL OIL and not Saudi oil! 
6600 2018-12-23 17:15:10 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
6601 2018-12-23 17:14:59 Web謎解きに見せかけてマルウェア仕込む事件とかまだないんですかね
6602 2018-12-23 17:14:54 exactly! Oil drilling ALWAYS allocates resources like time, energy and money in addition.
6603 2018-12-23 17:14:53 My foreign policy as Potus: "You have the oil. We wish to buy it at market prices. We are leaving now. If you decide not to sell the oil or screw with it geopolitically, we will come back, and there will be hell to pay. Have a nice day."
6604 2018-12-23 17:14:52 The unfortunate reality is that all the ones with integrity will be hard pressed, while the rest will enjoy paying their bills with oil money and such.
6605 2018-12-23 17:14:48 Yes there is an overlap especially when it comes to support for a big oil & the military industrialize complex, the yellow jackets in France are protesting neo liberalism!
6606 2018-12-23 17:14:38 @tizzyranking Guy! Your FPL players get oil this week o!
6607 2018-12-23 17:14:27 Did he offer to sell you the Kurd's oil reserves? I hear they are extensive... #TrumpResign
6608 2018-12-23 17:14:20 For every 10 gallons of hemp oil it takes 8 gallons to make it. Where are we supposed to grow the millions of acres required?
6609 2018-12-23 17:14:11 Sexist 

....men view groping different than women; chicks just have to accept that, mic drop and walk; but all working men are potential rapists that invade isolated communities because all oil workers are fucking vikings !!

wtf alien is living in that meat puppet ??
6610 2018-12-23 17:13:56 Difficult to know because Chávez eliminated all PDVSA audits, but OPEC calculates that according to figures of Venezuela’s oil buyers they have paid to the communist regime of Chávez/Maduro figures in the order of $977 billion in 18 years, and it became the poorest country in LA.
6611 2018-12-23 17:13:45 for farming ssr ships or events

Can you winch it back onto all four?

6625 2018-12-23 17:12:50 Heat pumps in their hundreds of millions... A lotta steel, copper, plastic, oil and leaked to the atmosphere refrigerant. You save electricity but open up a whole new problem waiting to happen - and it will. All HVAC systems lose gas over time.
6626 2018-12-23 17:12:47 By the way, the Kurds are not our allies, they want us to protect THEIR oil.  If we were attacked on home soil they wouldn’t come and help us
6627 2018-12-23 17:12:41 There is many job postings on the roadways next to big businesses. Please tell your followers that they need to get out and apply. 
Entitlement doesn't get u the high paying jobs of the past. The big corps laid off those folks when the price of oil tanked. Boom/bust cycle
6628 2018-12-23 17:12:40 What we have to do is STOP importing Saudi Oil. That Wiuid send a message to Saudi Arabia and keep our economy going.   Trudeau loves shooting us in the foot to show the world how good we are
6629 2018-12-23 17:12:38 I was thinking about releasing it only on oil can echo
6630 2018-12-23 17:12:18 ありがとうございます！！
また色々お話し聞かせてくださいな…
6631 2018-12-23 17:12:15 We’ve “engaged” in FAR more countries than the ME. We also didn’t give a crap when Saddam gassed the Kurds - we did nothing - but we sure cared when he tried 2 get Kuwait’s oil. Lithium in Afghan mountains; oil in Libya/Iran/Iraq. The govt wants $$$ & will create wars to get it.
6632 2018-12-23 17:12:05 UAE - oil producers will have extraordinary meeting if output Gary Anderson 'not enough'
6633 2018-12-23 17:12:03 In many years gone by, Oz told Oprah that stem cells are not the boondoggle people thought they may be. If it were Pharma would have snatched it up. This is snake oil in most cases.
6634 2018-12-23 17:12:02 Tea tree oil on your temples works wonders
6635 2018-12-23 17:11:53 200 miles offshore in the North Sea on the Brae Bravo Oil Rig
6636 2018-12-23 17:11:24 Yes he also promised Mexico would pay for it. If he can't keep the entire promise, he should drop it.
6637 2018-12-23 17:11:19 lrt: my teacher last summer told me all of this and I’ll definitely take it to heart when I finally venture into oil painting. (He also said to wash your hands with any random oil instead of toxic solvents/harsh soap or expensive walnut oil. The expensive oil is for brushes only)
6638 2018-12-23 17:11:09 Stop taking dirty oil money
6639 2018-12-23 17:11:07 The only acceptable  "second way" to cook Collard greens besides stewed in potlikker is Brasilian style where u roll them & chiffonade/ribbon cut them then saute in olive oil with slices of garlic. This isht on the sign is a culinary abomination.
6640 2018-12-23 17:11:06 Canadian oil is a great start!!
6641 2018-12-23 17:10:56 Remember Ivan glansberg robbed mark rich who was an apartheid businessman and  supplied apartheid government with oil and was latter given a contract at eskom and he employed Ivan glansberg who latter robbed him off his company and turned it to glencore
6642 2018-12-23 17:10:49 Oil paint
6643 2018-12-23 17:10:45 But these are the same “experts” who lied to get us into the wars in the first place. Congress passed no to intervene in Syria under Obama admin. He still did it. It’s battle of oil. Russia wants to keep the oil pipeline going into Europe. Qatar, US, Saudi want to built one.
6644 2018-12-23 17:10:16 I work on the financial end of it. You know seeing how much money to pay for repairs and how much they generate. So I do know how much the subsidies are. 37% less than oil receives

6648 2018-12-23 17:09:58 He’s also in a tough spot - populism is taking root in Alberta. They don’t want federal intervention when oil is up (let the market decide), but as soon as oil is down their hands are out and they go into whingy b*tch mode. Their pissy enough that some are talking separation.
6649 2018-12-23 17:09:34 "Garlic and tonnes of olive oil" is probably the solution to world peace.
6650 2018-12-23 17:08:59 Thank you so so so much girl!!! I gotta try CBD oil!

6661 2018-12-23 17:07:13 So you have spoken to 22km of drivers, all of them? You are fooling yourself by ignoring the con party had a major role is orchestrating this fiasco. What about the rights of others that use those roads to get to work and hospitals. Respect is not only for the oil sector.

6665 2018-12-23 17:07:00 the Dem leadership won't back the green new deal bc they are bought by gas/oil. They have stopped talking M4all bc they are bought by insurance companies. Trump is destructive but corrupt politicians (Dems included) will ultimately destroy us if we don't stop them.
6666 2018-12-23 17:06:49 And Baby Oil!
6667 2018-12-23 17:06:46 The price of oil had gone from $57 a barrel to $19 a barrel. Oil was the basis of Russia’s economy. They no longer could fund their military in East Germany. You and me and your Uncle Phil could have gone and torn down the wall. Reagan was a poser.
6668 2018-12-23 17:06:38 Because ole Jase is a bought politician. He is doing exactly what he’s been told to do by big oil.

6669 2018-12-23 17:06:32 Eli was one of the few who asked the rhetorical question (Eli knew) why the US stopped the SDF from attacking IS north of Euphrates when the SAA finished them off at Al Bukamal. The SDF secured the oil fields and then stopped for more than a year.
6670 2018-12-23 17:06:18 The government can’t control world oil prices and that no one wants shitty dirty oil when they can get better oil elsewhere. Time to get into another line of work. Diversify. This has nothing to do with immigrants, why are #YellowVestCanada veering into that issue?

6719 2018-12-21 23:56:34 I love love love oven roasting butternut squash in a olive oil/balsamic vinegar with some seasonings. 10/10
6720 2018-12-21 23:56:20 Steel corrodes. Seems like that will be a particularly big deal if you have a river but everywhere it will be exposed to weather. What is the plan for dealing with corrosion? Paint it? Oil it? How are you going to maintain it?  How hard will it be to knock down or cut the slats?
6721 2018-12-21 23:56:11 Bruhhhhh. I literally feel like I get a dayummm oil change, every other month 
6722 2018-12-21 23:56:07 Will always need some oil but no where near as much
6723 2018-12-21 23:55:27 Transportation costs are too high for EE and they don’t have any subscribers because it is a dead deal. Quebec should get credit for a huge increase in Alberta oil consumption instead of ignorant scorn.
6724 2018-12-21 23:55:17 Shiny af like a oil spill
6725 2018-12-21 23:55:14 Nightly Specials!

Soup:  curried parsnip 

Salad: Spring mix tossed in olive oil with salt + pepper & lemon juice, chickpeas, red onion, feta, sundried figs, and grape tomatoes 

Risotto:  Artichoke hearts and caramelized Cipollini onions 
6726 2018-12-21 23:55:07 Holy sh@t!  In the “Farm Bill” Trump just made hemp LEGAL again!
Do you know what this means?   Hemp has over 4000 uses!  From livestock feed, to clothes that are softer and longer lasting than cotton!  Even fuel oil!  MAGA BABY!  
6727 2018-12-21 23:54:55 Reminiscent of when GWB said the oil would pay for the Iraq War.

(The oil didn’t pay for the Iraq War)
6728 2018-12-21 23:54:54 Is God's will really murder flooding the streets?
Can we measure her love by the oil underneath?
All I ever wanted was what I was told I was owed
At what cost? I'll never know
6729 2018-12-21 23:54:44 Firestone does not have rubber trees in the desert. Otherwise, it's send in the troops. Why we do not need to be in Syria..."Syria is a relatively small oil producer, that accounted for just 0.5% of the global production in 2010, falling to less than 0.05% by 2016..."
6730 2018-12-21 23:54:40 I like USDNOK strong dollar weak oil. Or the Marcus TV ad with the dusty mattress might be good.
6731 2018-12-21 23:54:34 That good ol oil sir 
6732 2018-12-21 23:54:30 The ten year yield does a U-Turn nose dive back to well below 3% ...oil collapses..and Powell says he will hike more in 2019? Do you people take us for fools? This is a political stunt to try to assure Trump is a one-term...
6733 2018-12-21 23:54:24 Your point?  Our oil is discounted to OPEC oil so what does that have to do with your so called free enterprise?  If we could get our product east they would use it.
6734 2018-12-21 23:54:15 sesame oil with salt & pep will work wonders on the bland ass piece of meat that one family member who absolutely cannot cook brought
6735 2018-12-21 23:53:34 Oh, that stack of portfolios must be original oil paintings of you to give away for Christmas and are paid for through the Trump Foundation. 

Since you're killing time anyway, please check the US flag behind you and see if Pres. Frank Underwood's cigarette hole is still there...
6736 2018-12-21 23:53:32 No, the ownership makes no difference. There should be no new oil, gas or coal regardless of ownership. Existing mines and wells should be shut down as soon as possible. This is really a #ClimateEmergency, and it merits a "war effort" response. #StopAdani
6737 2018-12-21 23:53:28 Had to take a break from watching @GhostAdventures to get my oil changed. It's that serious. Lol
6738 2018-12-21 23:53:25 凄いですwww
6739 2018-12-21 23:53:06 Please bring “Wintershall” A German company to Pakistan  for Oil and Gas  Exploration. I worked with them, they are highly professionals. 
6740 2018-12-21 23:52:52 What would be extenuating circumstances? World oil Price collapse? Recession?
6741 2018-12-21 23:52:44 Never noticed how much a fence can look like snake oil.
6742 2018-12-21 23:52:26 I make this really good oil and I think I want to sell it. I swear it works miracles!
6743 2018-12-21 23:52:23 17 years in Afghanistan.  Syria and Middle East have been fighting this same war for 1000's of years. There will never be peace in those regions bc its religious and about oil as well. As far as terror attacks, they are planning those daily, whether we stay or leave.
6744 2018-12-21 23:52:23 Yup, but didn't you know the oil and gas companies paying little Marco won't let him act on climate change
6745 2018-12-21 23:51:59 Nobody but Noel and Liam Gallagher gave a shit about them until the oil money.
6746 2018-12-21 23:51:59 The cost of oil is regulated through OPEC. Visit their policies to learn more.
6747 2018-12-21 23:51:40 Not sure if it was the clove oil, Colloidal silver, cbd paste, oregano oil, coconut oil or white willow bark that helped my tooth some.
6748 2018-12-21 23:51:28 字幕あるだけでホントに言ってるように感じますよねぇ。
6749 2018-12-21 23:51:26 what kind of oil are you using in this video? it looks amazing.
6750 2018-12-21 23:51:24 Sir have you signed up to fight these illegal senseless wars over oil?
6751 2018-12-21 23:51:22 4.....this isn’t charity...one place he gets big money is from the fossil fuel industry. Do u think he is going to get on board with the green new deal when big oil is greasing his palms? Like Hillary, Obama, and the rest of them Corp dems they say progressive
6752 2018-12-21 23:51:10 Not happy with the Dems here.  Being owned by big oil is selling out constituent’s future for your personal pay day.  DONT BE REPUBS!!!
6753 2018-12-21 23:51:01 Chicken and Broccolj Rice Bowls with Chile Garlic Sauce.  A stir fry of 5 spice chicken. Broccoli. Ginger. Soy sauce. Sesame oil. Onions. Carrots. Cabbage. Garlic. Bean sprouts. Friday night dinner.
6754 2018-12-21 23:50:51 Snake oil salesman.
6755 2018-12-21 23:50:44 The only reason we have a war on Christmas is because they found oil at the North Pole.
6756 2018-12-21 23:50:32 So why ask the barriers to get our oil to market?  Also if our oil is a $40/barrel discount don't say its free enterprise. It's not allowing our oil to get to market by fake regulations and back door politics that's the problem.  Our country is a laughing stock
6757 2018-12-21 23:50:31 I do so seriously hope this judge is boiled in oil! Or is he looking for 2 min. of fame?
6758 2018-12-21 23:50:28 The US Announces Plans to Withdraw Ground Troops From Syria: BUT THE REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & "OIL" CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS' PENNY-GONE HOODS ARE STILL GONNA BOMB DA PHUK OUTTA SYRIA, MURDERING MORE PEOPLE !!!
6759 2018-12-21 23:50:24 It is amazing that the city is always regarded as a failed city yet the people have refused to leave. Even the HQ of oil companies that were told to relocate to the Niger Delta didn't leave Lagos. There must be something in that Lagos that keeps people there despite its failings
6760 2018-12-21 23:50:19 Stock market is lowered in price so that poor people can get a cut of the dividends. Same with oil. It is cheaper to buy oil and gas now.
It is a good thing!
6761 2018-12-21 23:50:18 Well guess what?!!! Sudan is ruled by a terrible regime which deprives the people of  their basic rights such as bread and oil, and most recently the access to Facebook!!! No one gives a ****. Even the biggest human rights organizations!!!!
6762 2018-12-21 23:49:54 モリ様ごめん遊ぼってとこで耐えきれなくなりましたwwwwww
6763 2018-12-21 23:49:29 @Matt_VanDyke it certainly wasn't oil or gas ? I read the story thirty years ago and it is definitely a true story that I do know so what the hell is it that's worth more than any thing Saddam Hussein owned because  there is go back 50 years ago and yo will find the answer s star
6764 2018-12-21 23:49:23 Bullshit! You are literally handing billions to oil and pipeline companies while Indigenous children are giving up hope on decent water, minimal health care, basic education and health care. There is no "we" when you have mishandle your brief so despicably.

6766 2018-12-21 23:49:09 Remember like 2-3 years ago when every company was pushing coconut oil in everything? Soooo...

......is the fad over?
6767 2018-12-21 23:49:08 Garri plus palm oil
6768 2018-12-21 23:49:07 I got an oil change and new tires today but what I’m really excitied about are these empanadas y mi  juego d mango en agua
6769 2018-12-21 23:48:54 There are 5.2 million people in Norway. All rich from oil. Oil buys batteries. Batteries need to be charged? Get a lot of sun in Norway? Batteries pollute too.
6770 2018-12-21 23:48:45 So what’s the best essential oil that will add a few chromosomes on my face?
6771 2018-12-21 23:48:35 You’ll often find that you achieve better results if you run your air fryer at a temperature that is below the smoke point of whatever particular oil you’re using at the time. #ChefPaulsProTips

6773 2018-12-21 23:48:27 Oil prices are going to fall UNTIL the energy deals are on the precipice of default. They will pump until they do, and the market will go looking for stops just like in 2016. Breakevens are just the new price targets.
6774 2018-12-21 23:48:22 Jesse just told me not to look at the TV so of course I do and it’s the dawn commercial with the baby ducks covered in oil and now I’m on the verge of tears ranting about how we’re all shit
6775 2018-12-21 23:48:03 True but why the hell are we still buying oil from them then
6776 2018-12-21 23:47:47 One step at a time. Fixed my own car damaged wiper. Next, needa learn how to change my oil 
6777 2018-12-21 23:47:45 こちらこそ、お誘いありがとうございました！
あの場所は絶景でした…役得ですね…
6778 2018-12-21 23:47:33 If there are huge oil Wells in those countries, you'll send troops before long, don't you worry.
6779 2018-12-21 23:47:30 Your brain Oil the over flow .
6780 2018-12-21 23:47:27 I was in Odessa,Texas last week,which is ground zero for the oil boom.The 24 hours McDonald's closes at night for lack of employees and the Blue Beacon Truck Wash is paying $24/hour to wash trucks.
6781 2018-12-21 23:47:21 Uhhhhhhhhhh. The dish of olive oil is a nice touch.
6782 2018-12-21 23:47:19 ああ 気付けばカラダは蜂の巣 ドクドク 流れるVirgin Oil
6783 2018-12-21 23:47:12 Where’s the crocodile filled moat and the burning tar and oil?
6784 2018-12-21 23:47:12 I might try those with like wild growth oil and make a mixture then apply it everyday
6785 2018-12-21 23:47:08 Just what I thought; the hard left is just as bad as the hard right. Both angry, hateful, yet somewhat charismatic in the way of a snake oil salesman, but always able to charm the ignorant.
6786 2018-12-21 23:47:07 Is there any research for this oil?
6787 2018-12-21 23:47:02 I think it is more that this mine is Indian owned, it gives protestors the opportunity to participate in xenophobic protests against a soft target...India. 

They never protest about middle eastern oil or propose close down current mines.
6788 2018-12-21 23:47:00 my hair do not act right without coconut oil 
6789 2018-12-21 23:46:46 They’d rather split California than sell off a money maker.   Alaska has oil.   Hawaii though is a culture itself that was a kingdom.

6793 2018-12-21 23:45:46 @donlemon 1st-u r my FAVOURITE.  Great heart.  Now- U know D.T is a snake oil salesman.  Totally corrupt in all ways.  He's pushing 4 the 5B because he either is getting HUGE kick-back, or has shell co. to build it. Expects to be indicted or impeached, so cash is for future.
6794 2018-12-21 23:45:39 And I’m changing my own oil tomorrow lol I’m getting more accomplished in the last week of 2018 than I did all year

6800 2018-12-21 23:44:21 @Matt_VanDyke pay for the Iraq war but they didn't take any so what is worth more than Saddam Hussein owned more than all  the oil  in the ground more than all  his hispalaces all his gold all the money stashed in foreign  bank accounts so what the hell did they realy go in Iraq
6801 2018-12-21 23:44:11 Primary anyone taking the oil money.

6817 2018-12-21 23:40:38 According to Fox News and Business it’s oil prices fault. The feds fault and world economy doing bad. Not Trump at all.

6824 2018-12-21 23:39:58 Lol just stood in line to ask for an oil change for 25 minutes for the guy to come up to me and tell me no. HAHAHAHAHA FUCK YOU
6825 2018-12-21 23:39:49 Think about That. 
If the oil cos drilling in ANWR have ANY kind of oil spill they are legally allowed to WALK AWAY. 
Please Retweet . 
I dont think many people are aware of that gift Trump sneakily gave to oil cos.
6826 2018-12-21 23:39:48 That’s a big reason why CNG and Propane vehicles won’t get any popular. All the oil companies want to bitch and fight amongst each other.
6827 2018-12-21 23:39:33 i wanna learn how to oil paint it looks so good
6828 2018-12-21 23:39:29 lol, no it’s more of a joke. I saw something on twitter that said “What’s the best essential oil to get someone to stop texting you” and added my own spin to it

6836 2018-12-21 23:38:49 Why don’t you use wind and solar exclusively? 
You can & live by your principles but you hypocritically remain on the coal grid ... and use as much oil as any westerner and so more oil than 95% of the earths population- your self evidently an irrational hypocrite.

for freedom.
6842 2018-12-21 23:37:31 Thats how it was done , by those 2 sellouts. 
There was no discussion about ANW
& no environmental testimony taken.
There was no discussion of Trump's new policy that IF the oil co had an oil spill there, they owe ZERO money to repair it .

6854 2018-12-21 23:36:06 Anyone out there use CBD Oil? I bought it for my back pain, tell me if it works for you
6855 2018-12-21 23:36:05 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
6856 2018-12-21 23:35:54 Black castor oil does the trick
6857 2018-12-21 23:35:54 Some boiling oil at the top of the wall?
6858 2018-12-21 23:35:52 And here I thought car blood was motor oil. Huh. Learn something new everyday
6859 2018-12-21 23:35:51 Depende oil
6860 2018-12-21 23:35:50 You mean the Syrian oil the US seized?

6862 2018-12-21 23:35:15 Where are the moat and the catapults that shoot flaming oil?
6863 2018-12-21 23:35:05 Shame I thought you could have held up your argument by telling me CNN, MSNBC didn’t report it.

Then we could have moved on to why you think this news is so big given that the USA still imports millions of barrels of oil per day.

Hey but at least you know your own flag now 
6864 2018-12-21 23:35:03 When ya hair is thinning and looks dry bc you don’t moisturize/seal w oil... the last thing you should be doing is letting the Dominicans wash and set w that high heat

6866 2018-12-21 23:34:41 All these people have been getting rich off Wall Street War Stocks and Oil Stocks for so long now, it's like a drug for them. Wars paid for off the backs of Americans living paycheck to paycheck. @ACLU @POTUS #NYC #Congress #MSM
6867 2018-12-21 23:34:41 Or they come here because we've been there.  The man that took down the world trade center was the same man we trained to fight the Russians. We're exporting oil now, we need to ween ourselves off of Saudi Arabia's teat and make the Petroldollar a conspiracy theory again.
6868 2018-12-21 23:34:36 Wasnt long ago you were tossing yerself off beating Gillingham in a play off. 
You are where you are coz of oil money. 

A city fan using money spent to make a point.....Remember, it was 1976 since your last pre oil money trophy.
6869 2018-12-21 23:34:32 Surely there is something more worthwhile you can focus on? Anti Fracking, promotion of EV’s, advancement of Solar? .. why pick on #UKOG at the moment we need oil, why not get it locally?
6870 2018-12-21 23:34:29 Where’s the oil ??

6872 2018-12-21 23:33:25 Listen up and soak some Slovak wisdom:
Finely chopped onion, Hungarian sausage (but chorizo will do), mushrooms all on oil, water, potatoes, plenty of salt, lentils. You can cook, figure the rest on your own. Optional broccoli and green beans. Thank me later.
6873 2018-12-21 23:33:18 I think the biggest stumbling block to unlimited economic growth is the cost of energy (look at how oil prices affect the economy!). We need a cheap and clean source of energy and with cheap, I mean so cheap that it is essentially free. It would cause an economic boom.
6874 2018-12-21 23:33:08 ค่ากดเท่าไหร่คะ
6875 2018-12-21 23:33:07 Senator Lisa Murkowski , Alaska traded her vote on the 2017 Tax Bill in exchange for Trump sneaking in the hidden clause (into that tax bill ) saying oil corps can now drill in ANWR. 
Thats how the most valuable untouched wilderness owned by US
got sold off.
6876 2018-12-21 23:32:50 He’s after me too as I need the oil to walk

6878 2018-12-21 23:32:44 Cars are only ~27% of overall oil demand and electrification will take several decades to reach a penetration rate that is meaningful. Oil demand to continue to grow to ~2040.

6880 2018-12-21 23:32:35 TFW there’s oil under the Golan Heights, but troll prez won’t let you overthrow Assad for your masters.
6881 2018-12-21 23:32:33 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
6882 2018-12-21 23:32:31 You’re so dense!!!! One thing is getting fired, another is quitting, because that’s exactly what he did, he couldn’t be an accomplice for the UNHINGED snake oil salesman,seating in the Oval Office!!! 
Read the letter of resignation!!! Thurd!!!

6885 2018-12-21 23:32:15 Bring George back into Labour I mean. He's never wavered in his loyalty nor in speaking out for what he believes to be right even when it has not been popular. Blair on the other hand is a snake oil salesman that long after having been seen through is still peddling his wares
6886 2018-12-21 23:31:49 It is so archaic that we don't have better rail, esp high speed rail service, throughout this country.  Thanks goes to the oil lobby!! And prob automotive industry lobby.
6887 2018-12-21 23:31:43 Sir u really should check yourself & ur facts. 1st. Campaign promise Mexico will pay 4 wall. No USA residents 2. Stocks falling 3. Jobs coming home 4. Oil will be in wide demand. Stop using Trump as a rating marketing hoax. Love ur country more than ratings
6888 2018-12-21 23:31:09 Poloz “we don’t see anything signs of a recession in 2019”  .....yeah maybe if the oil industry and real estate are excluded. What a complete idiot
6889 2018-12-21 23:31:03 The last thing I'd ever recommend is a "high end gaming" router. Most are just snake oil.
6890 2018-12-21 23:31:00 yummmm seal oil is the best!
6891 2018-12-21 23:30:51 The oil industry doesn’t take us serious because of all the end fighting amongst the different groups. We can’t even get on the same page to work together.    Very few people even understand how the fuel works.

6894 2018-12-21 23:30:36 Oil capped its biggest weekly decline since 2016 on concerns that weakening economic growth and surging U.S. supply will lead to a surplus next year, overwhelming OPEC’s efforts to stabilize the market.
6895 2018-12-21 23:30:31 Cooking oil* Lmao
6896 2018-12-21 23:30:26 I have started eating a lot more fish, and supplementing the cod with fish oil for the vitamin D. And I feel a LOT better now. Not sure why you need extra magnesium?
6897 2018-12-21 23:30:20  I thought we just got an oil change?

6900 2018-12-21 23:29:40 As I recall, Jimmy Carter said we were running out of oil and lowered the national speed limit to 55 and said we needed to lower our thermostat in the winter and wear a sweater at hiome. I thinking he had been listening to his drunken brother
6901 2018-12-21 23:29:38 Oh god, I don’t even know where to begin with it... the dolphins, Axel trudging along the deck of an oil tanker and showering with his clothes on, Slash soloing and gliding, the gratuitous smoking, the walking on water, drowning Axel getting pissed at people trying to save him...
6902 2018-12-21 23:29:37 look for an oil barrel and cut it in half and you will be good to braai
6903 2018-12-21 23:29:08 Money, oil, bribery, treason, what a soap opera.

6906 2018-12-21 23:28:47 Joel 2:24-25 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil. And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.
6907 2018-12-21 23:28:45 I head about that episode, haven't seen it. But there is an actual episode of a snake oil salesman character and get this. His name was Trump. Truth. You, being you Mr. King could get your hands on it. I've seen it. It's remarkably creepy.
6908 2018-12-21 23:28:42 Is fruit healthy? How about veg oil? Potatoes?
6909 2018-12-21 23:28:41 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 9 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

6910 2018-12-21 23:28:36 I guess that or cookie oil will have to do 
6911 2018-12-21 23:28:25 its about the infilling only of the holy ghost oil of joy at work in u seen by world around u all-get revived not by begging God for revival but by much labour to spirit ways of God-prayin-reading bible-study his word-u think God going to do all for u-
6912 2018-12-21 23:28:13 So let's review:  CIA and MI6 illegally overthrow Democractic Iran Prime Minister in 1953, install puppet Shah for oil interests which leads to Iran Theocracy, which threatens Isreal, which leads to unilateral US sanctions which rest of the world have to follow. Go forth lackey.
6913 2018-12-21 23:28:05 Hopefully my car stop shaking after i get a oil change 
6914 2018-12-21 23:28:00 Should personal information be viewed as a resource to be extracted and monetized? Is all data like gold and like oil? The conversation should be about digital rights and not property.
6915 2018-12-21 23:27:57 I worked on the fringe of the oil Industry all my career and my husband worked in Mgnt on SAGD, CSS, open put, refinery construction his whole career too. Sorry I misspelled your name and yes I do wish you all well but not at the expense of life. That is true.
6916 2018-12-21 23:27:54 get hold of the altar of God before his seven burning fires of his heavenly lamp now always a great preserve of God's oil and fires but u need get with program of heaven not man as see here a tradition only a religious vain cerimony seen only-
6917 2018-12-21 23:27:48 As is ur ignorant assessment. The US has no military policy other than to rule the petrodollar. Ur the 1 in need of a major wake up. But ur correct on the 70,000 cost of illegal/immigrant/refugees (CAUSED By OUR GREEDY OIL TAKEDOWNS)-They don't cost that #...THEY COST FAR MORE!
6918 2018-12-21 23:27:36 Call me old fashioned; but if a girl calls you daddy, you should prolly go check the oil in her vw Jetta.

6926 2018-12-21 23:26:44 Just wait till we buy 7000 rail cars and really get the oil flowing.  #abpoli
6927 2018-12-21 23:26:39 Why process heavy crudes at all? Their emissions per barrel are far higher than other oils. The point is that if you build pipelines more Canadian heavy oil will be produced. If you don't, it won't. Then we can move on to closing or retrofitting heavy oil processing refineries.
6928 2018-12-21 23:26:37 Oil and oregano covered thin sliced pizza crust!
6929 2018-12-21 23:26:25 I've thought about trying CBD oil
6930 2018-12-21 23:26:19 Why do investors flinch at every squeak and rattle the market, if it hurts them more than anyone else? I can see fears, but push fordward regardless. You can’t win a war if you’re in constant retreat. The market should be over 30,000 by now. Oil, Tariffs, interest rates, push on!
6931 2018-12-21 23:26:18  Christmas Wishes
1 MSM become unbiased journalist again - it can be done
2 Politicians actually answer questions in Question Period 
3 Quebec realizes the importance of oil industry to all Cdns & lets a pipeline be built
4 Notley & Trudeau are voted out in 2019
ho ho ho
6932 2018-12-21 23:25:53 The the price of oil seems to be the indicator of the sentiment of the mkt.
6933 2018-12-21 23:25:42 And patchouli oil
6934 2018-12-21 23:25:34 Go back to selling snake oil to parents who hate their autistic children.
6935 2018-12-21 23:25:28 Just a bet on oil, everything overvalued with oil here.
6936 2018-12-21 23:25:24 Joel 2:19 Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen:
6937 2018-12-21 23:25:23 I'm waiting for an oil change and they're playing nothing but Christmas music in here PLEASE end my existence thank you in advance
6938 2018-12-21 23:25:18 i hope my mom gets me CBD oil for christmas (mom i know you’re reading this you’re beautiful and i love you please get me CBD oil for christmas)
6939 2018-12-21 23:25:12 Really simple.  Just use a Heron from CDC Scotland Ltd  and link to standard  oil and gas buoyancy systems. Its not rocket science. @PetrostarsAT time to act rather than more head scratching @ORECatapult @Orsted etc. Scotland needs affordable clean energy for the less well off.
6940 2018-12-21 23:25:09 It's not last but begining !
6941 2018-12-21 23:24:59 Islam is +1400 years old and terorism was born in the 70's exactely right after the petrol embargo by saudis in 71.
coincidently oil rich countries seemed the only ones infected at the time.
you do the math
6942 2018-12-21 23:24:45 Is being there for us a New Years resolution?
Oil field workers hate you,  CUPW and unions hate you.  Been to Oshawa lately?  I bet they’re not to fond of you.
6943 2018-12-21 23:24:44 I started Googling how to change the oil in my car, and wound up reading an article on how to milk a camel.
6944 2018-12-21 23:24:36 I think that's the point. He was lobbying in opposition to the cabal oil interests, and thus was targeted by Obama/Clinton for annihilation.
6945 2018-12-21 23:24:25 The fact is that #abndp has been championing the TMX pipeline for some time, plus other measures to protect oil jobs. I suspect the recent spate of "grassroot" rallies is the right's attempt to pretend they are the champions of oil workers.
6946 2018-12-21 23:24:04 Coconut oil and coconut cream are good.
6947 2018-12-21 23:24:03 In 1910, Gattefosse burned a hand very badly and later claimed he treated it effectively with Lavender Oil.
6948 2018-12-21 23:24:01 Today, Nigeria’s the 4th largest country in the world that produce oil. With the same token, Ethiopia is also knowing for Coffee yet not one day I witnessed label In supermarket which mentioned both country as in “Made in_____” #Ethiopia #Nigeria
6949 2018-12-21 23:23:45 Really wanna make my own yoni oil but have no idea where to start
6950 2018-12-21 23:23:35 Oil and Israel? Damn, please do tell me more about this subject you evidently have tons of knowledge on.
6951 2018-12-21 23:23:33 god I really like the idea of weed infused thai iced tea but the reality is it's like the worst parts of making thai iced tea and the worst parts of making weed oil and I fucking hate myself rn
6952 2018-12-21 23:23:32 Remember @realDonaldTrump said, "He'd take Syria's oil", Now he hands Syria, and Afghanistan to Putin, as Trump ruins US economy, ALSO FOR PUTIN. #TrumpsShutdown is just to distract US from the INSTABILITY he's causing worldwide by taking US troops out to let Putin & ISIS rule.
6953 2018-12-21 23:23:28 @zimAdverts_com looking for a closed oil barrel
6954 2018-12-21 23:23:26 It doesn't affect me...but why invade and not grant statehood? But the point was "wars" for oil and other resources. 

I'm pro-statehood and yes, absolutely, the island is better off with the U S. than it was under Spain (my opinion).
6955 2018-12-21 23:23:24 the mop of snake oil salesman, bet and switch! soon you hear from his cult followers, he’s genius negotiator!
6956 2018-12-21 23:23:22 I got home and wanted to nap so my mom busts out the essential oil diffuser w some lavender lmao bro I’m hella spoliled here 
6957 2018-12-21 23:23:17 @realDonaldTrump Why don’t you double down in Syria, take their oil and sell it, then you can pay for your Mexican wall?? I think you’ve mentioned something like this in Iraq in the past.
6958 2018-12-21 23:23:15 You're right about pipelines (mis-spoke on that, reading too fast), but I said that Canada and Venezuela heavy oils are far worse that Saudi oil.
6959 2018-12-21 23:22:57 Also I've forgotten how much I love the little pops of oil that pop onto my skin??? It makes me feel so ALIVE!!!!
6960 2018-12-21 23:22:51 *Lavender oil on pillow*sweet dreams
6961 2018-12-21 23:22:49 I’m definitely getting my car detailed, aligned, new tires, oil change, new headlights, and figure out why she start making that noise two days ago 
6962 2018-12-21 23:22:47 Throwing in my two cents! This presidency  is the worst con job since the first guy who sold snake oil. Hell, at least that guy could spell #TrumpResign
6963 2018-12-21 23:22:40 Perfect. And he does kinda look like Bill Mumy fell into a vat of hot oil. (with apologies to @BillMumy .
6964 2018-12-21 23:22:39 I am old enough to remember how #Turkey was helping ISIS sell Oil
6965 2018-12-21 23:21:56 I did this to a @latinhoneyshop jar to clear the label. We now use it for coconut oil sent over from the amazon jungle

6967 2018-12-21 23:21:48 I Stevie , the non-sceintist likes you, that's pretty impressive. I asked you to define "climate scientist" not just vaguely describe what the can do. Where did you answer whether you though oil had o be biogenic?
6968 2018-12-21 23:21:45 Copaiba, Lavender and Melaleuca in coconut oil in a spray bottle for my babies bottoms!

6970 2018-12-21 23:21:32 Teachers won't give a damn if oil revenues to the state slow down. They want more money and every other priority can go to hell
6971 2018-12-21 23:21:20 Would representatives who accepted contributions from fossil-fuel company employees (meter readers, gas station employees, miners, etc.) be excluded? What about those receiving funds from oil and gas industry unions and union employees?

6981 2018-12-21 23:19:53 I see so much big talk from Nigerians on Twitter. That’s a country that sat out the great period of African liberation in the 60s and 70s because they were too busy slaughtering their own. That executed Saro-Wiwa on behalf of Dutch Shell oil. Maybe time to chill?

6989 2018-12-21 23:18:57 Dan Meis: "Ahhh...yes...for the record, I don’t love Lucas Oil.  There are some aspects of the historic “fabric” that are relevant but BM will feel more contemporary, unique to its site, not a copy of an older architecture"
6990 2018-12-21 23:18:51 There’s a difference between “isolationism” and opting not to intervene militarily in every regional squabble just because oil and Israel are also in the hemisphere.
6991 2018-12-21 23:18:48 Snake oil can literally do anything. That's the power of snake oil.
6992 2018-12-21 23:18:46 The purpose of the KXL pipeline was to substitute Canadian heavy sour crude oil for Saudi, Venezuelan and Mexican heavy sour crude.....what exactly about that do you not understand?   Heavy sour crude is the preferred feedstock for gulf coast refineries which can process it.
6993 2018-12-21 23:18:39 いっその事風呂でシコりつつお食事どうですか。
6994 2018-12-21 23:18:27 Saudi Arabia oil is still cheaper to produce than fracking they were inflating prices to secure their wealth. Fracking keeps oil below $70  every time oil starts rise out production shoots back up dropping the price again

6998 2018-12-21 23:17:43 And how else could the oil be transported?  Got any good ideas?  Pipelines brake also.
6999 2018-12-21 23:17:36 @NatureValley yo how are you guys all about nature if your stuff has palm oil in it?
7000 2018-12-21 23:17:23 i need some good oil for my hair 
7001 2018-12-21 23:17:22 You think the US as the world’s Number One oil producer is good for Russia? Do they like our military buildup? We are not helping them.
But they have noticed they are living rent-free in Dems heads. What a great return for $100K of Facebook ads, to drive half the US crazy.
7002 2018-12-21 23:17:22 Why not a moat that burns Saudi oil 24x7.  They owe you one and according to you there is no climate change. #nowall #buildamoat. Arm border agents with horses and swords, not jeeps and guns.  Make immigrants joust for entry #impeachnow

Nah, you definitely not spilling all the secrets. Wow just wow. MLK didn't die for this uno!

7011 2018-12-21 23:16:45 There Will Be Blood. I never thought I’d be interested in oil lmao
7012 2018-12-21 23:16:40 Too late. I'm glad your colleagues see oil down 40% in a month and think "wow growth and inflation is out of control, better hike some more".
7013 2018-12-21 23:16:38 Thought I was done, but no. To those who said Flynn didn't deserve a happy ending. maybe he didn't, but Wyatt did, seriously? If it's about the number of people killed, did Wyatt kill less? At least Flynn did it for love, not as a soldier protecting oil pipes. #Timeless #Garcy

7018 2018-12-21 23:16:08 Some people are fighting for the restoration of
sleaze,
slush money,

selling  oil fields at 1% value,
export of understated quantities crude oil,
budget 'allocation and ownership'.

This 'unusual' government is their economic bane.

@noorazor back me on this
7024 2018-12-21 23:14:58 Seriously that’s the best you can come up with . I suppose without your oil hugging rule breaking owners you would still be nobodies but hey whose counting
7025 2018-12-21 23:14:50 How's the snake oil selling?
7026 2018-12-21 23:14:40 This looks so medieval! I like it! What about a moat? A bucket that dumps hot oil!? Very Game of Thrones. I mean, it’s fucking stupid, but cute for a child to imagine.
7027 2018-12-21 23:14:23 Nearly 100% of carbon emissions come from oil, gas and coal.
7028 2018-12-21 23:14:17 When I worked in Oil Industry with branches & customers worldwide you had to be flexible, esp at this time of year where folk went on holiday & were uncontactable. I was also supposedly 9-5, but had responsibility over Indonesia team, meant early in, late out.
7029 2018-12-21 23:14:14 “To grant those who mourn in Zion, Giving them a garland instead of ashes, The oil of gladness instead of mourning, The mantle of praise instead of a spirit of fainting. So they will be called oaks of righteousness, The planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified.” Isaiah 61:3
7030 2018-12-21 23:14:01 If you’re using “the” rice pot, let it heat then add oil and salt but don’t add rice yet. Add rice to hot oil (Use 1:2 rice to water ratio) and “stir fry” dry rice for like 30-40 seconds then add water, boil then simmer. Buen provecho
7031 2018-12-21 23:13:55 Your tweet is nonsense.   Heavy sour crude oil from tar sands in Canada & Venezuela (including tar sands in that country) are very similar as to life-cycle CO2 emissions.   Pipeline transport is far more energy efficient with less emissions than train transport.
7032 2018-12-21 23:13:55 Friends & family with sleds: We're finally getting some snow over the next few days!

I've got a lot of 2-stroke and 4-stroke oils in stock, along with some chaincase and gear oil, give me a shout!
7033 2018-12-21 23:13:45 Use shea butter or coconut oil on the scar.  It will diminish it

7043 2018-12-21 23:12:15 So what if it had been your flight downed by one of these idiotic things?  I'm sure your air brained supporters would've blamed Westminster, the Butcher's Apron, the theft of North Sea Oil or a small Union Jack on the tail plane.

7054 2018-12-21 23:10:58 The massive expansion of expensive to produce oil meant for export. That is the big mistake they made.
7055 2018-12-21 23:10:48 Controversial...but cut PEF... we class teachers have the biggest impact on attainment rather than the snake oil salesmen that have preyed on schools knowing their PEF allocation! Some PEG interventions are fantastic...but a lot are more than questionable!

7068 2018-12-21 23:09:33 @ElizabethMay So you are a environmentalist. You bitch about pipelines. But BC ships out 11.3+ MILLION TONNES of coal per year. So it's fine for BC to do this crap but you don't want oil shipped out of the lowermain land. #Canada #CANADA
7069 2018-12-21 23:09:18 It’s mandatory for my dad to come w/ me to get my car checked. These mfs tried to charge me $80 for an oil change & they told my dad $60 I swear men ain’t shit
7070 2018-12-21 23:09:16 I've been off all week and I managed to get my oil changed....read a book and a half....oh and I got jiggy with it.
7071 2018-12-21 23:09:15 Peppermint oil in candy canes contains a substantial amount of antioxidants, in fact among the highest found in nature.  Peppermint oil in candy canes kills the microbes that cause bad breath
comforting multiple gut ailments such as irritable bowel syndrome, cramps and nausea.
7072 2018-12-21 23:09:15 May the Syrians invade this country and murder your family b/c they want your oil.
7073 2018-12-21 23:09:13 Tis a tough situation but gas is circa 50% of prod so I wonder if the crash in oil prices would materialise to losses in profit sub the actual drop, as nat gas hedges are lower and prod(30% of it) for oil is hedged at 69 dollars and, 72 bucks in h2.
7074 2018-12-21 23:08:54 No. Whaling is their culture and they use the oil and blubber. They won’t be told. It’s very disappointing.
7075 2018-12-21 23:08:33 Look into the dark money that Mitch is getting from oil companies.
7076 2018-12-21 23:08:17 In this case, almost any liquid will do which will thin the oil. A small amount or sulphuric acid, varnish, water-glass, or linseed oil will be especially effective.
7077 2018-12-21 23:08:05 Would any health/beauty bloggers be interested in reviewing our CBD oil and products in the new year. Email info@paradisecbd.co.uk :)

7080 2018-12-21 23:07:30 I'm unsure if it's really helping this early or not, but since started the fish oil tablets to help with omega-3 levels and such... I just feel a lot better. Less foggy, more focused, remembering things already... is placebo effect? Dunno. But it's workin'.
7081 2018-12-21 23:07:25 It's just usually a three letter word that the strategy is focused on....OIL
7082 2018-12-21 23:07:21 I have watched Alexandria Ocasio Cortez speeches on the Green New Deal and her words match the Green Party version of the Green New Deal.
The issue is that Congress members are bought off and are corrupted by oil money and their donors prohibit them from supporting alternatives

7085 2018-12-21 23:06:35 It's like a game of Monopoly where players can pick up new icons at any time + start playing all positions at once. The only coherent ME position in past 50 yrs was one that helped American oil companies. The rest is murder of our soldiers and civilians + theft of tax dollars.
7086 2018-12-21 23:06:29 You get those things looked at?

7090 2018-12-21 23:06:12 Yes , I was associating a question about Arrhenius with a different troll with a handful of followers. Why don't you answer my questions? If you can't call up someone to ask, you can try Google. But here: Do you think oil cannot have abiogenic sources? Define "climate scientist."

7093 2018-12-21 23:05:50 Grimoire for the Green Witch by Ann Moura is fantastic. Tons of info on candle, herb, essential oil purposes, circle instructions, basic spells, charms. I use it almost every day to coordinate moon cycles with charm making.
7094 2018-12-21 23:05:28 It's an idiotic, medieval, isolationist idea, and a colossal waste of money, promoted by a damned fool real estate salesman who has no clue of how to get along with his own allies.  

Don't buy his snake oil.  The answer is NO, and forever NO.  Read your own Statue of Liberty. 
7095 2018-12-21 23:05:17 America has; invaded multiple nations to steal OIL, murdered civilians, assassinated heads of state, financed revolutions, installed dictators & supported oppressive regimes!

7098 2018-12-21 23:05:02 Let’s try this.. how about a ‘reputable’ group takes an actual popular vote of Quebec’ers on a pipeline and see just how many vote ‘yes’ to Canadian oil and pipelines.. let’s expose the corruption. I hazard a guess that there is more support there than we ever hear of!
7099 2018-12-21 23:04:48 If the world knew that there is a Plan to take Saudi oil by trump & Putin!
7100 2018-12-21 23:04:48 @niknanos Just watched you with Steve Murphy and noted the changes in our political leanings.
I did see a poll result quoted today (not yours, I presume) that 66% of Qeubecois prefer Canadian over imported oil. I wonder if politicians have ever really presented EE to QC voters?
7101 2018-12-21 23:04:47 Gotta go buy more chili oil at the store! We're all out....again. >_>"

7104 2018-12-21 23:04:14 yeah coconut oil doesn't always work with people, sis dm me
7105 2018-12-21 23:04:05 I have a question for you, what happens if we didn't pull oil out of the ground? If the core is hot and gravity puts on pressure wouldn't we end up with more earthquakes and volcanoes eruptions? Isn't the layers of earth just overburden compressed by heat and pressure?
7106 2018-12-21 23:03:48 they’re chakra oil blends :)
7107 2018-12-21 23:03:35 I’ve been using Cantu’s detangling conditioner, Shea moisturizer Jamaican black castor oil leave in, and oil and it has been a miracle. Surprisingly Cantu’s conditioner doesn’t dry my hair out like others
7108 2018-12-21 23:02:59 Your not wrong. But just because some company builds more oil infustructure doesnt mean even remotely that itll change or even effect international trade agreements
7109 2018-12-21 23:02:58 Put clove oil on it...
7110 2018-12-21 23:02:50 I can’t believe they making me get my own oil changed 
7111 2018-12-21 23:02:45 Oil is not for the weak, it's the Earth's milk, and only the strong can suckle it mothers teat!
7112 2018-12-21 23:02:41 The only thing Trump can do is take over the oil industry, or go green!

ドラマパート良いですね!!というかこれだけ入ってて400円ってお買い得過ぎますね!?!?
7114 2018-12-21 23:02:26 I do most of my shopping at my local Co-op store. I decided a long time ago to be very conscious where I spend my money. I check to see if anything has palm oil, tested on animals or contain anything that harms the environment. Yes, it’s a bit more expensive. I’d rather pay more
7115 2018-12-21 23:02:24 Came to my uncles shop for an oil change but it just turned into a family reunion 
7116 2018-12-21 23:02:14 I’ve been putting CBD oil on my back these past 2 days for the insane pain I have... and let me tell you.... WOOOOOOOOOOOW!!! I haven’t slept that good in so long. I’ve been with this pain since high school and it’s only gotten worse.

7128 2018-12-21 23:00:25 Fact is we have more then enough oil infustructure to be energy independent. The problem is Canada doesnt own its resources private buisness' do and they only sell to the highest bidder so no amount of pipelines will ever be enough under this model

Looked into geothermal - est to put in the hot air ducts was $60,000 (not the well or pump) 15 years ago.  We have oil.

7181 2018-12-21 22:53:37 Indeed, but isn't it then also true that Alberta oil is moving to tidewater even in the absence of a pipeline? Perhaps oil by rail is simply the path of least resistance and we should run with that.

WTI had been ultra volatile this week and the oil markets were chaotic at least. That said, it was a good time to trade WTI and make profits if you know how.
7253 2018-12-21 22:45:27 All anyone has to do is google where the US troops are. OIL fields. The US is in Syria illegally and Russia is not. The US needs to follow International law and get out of where it NEVER should have been.
7254 2018-12-21 22:45:22 I think Elise Stefanik follows you so you can come up on my feed so I can oil at it and see what an entitled swamp rat looks like
7255 2018-12-21 22:45:11 Funny, I dont see Trump tweeting about how well the market is doing anymore! Cant believes he has so many tricked. Total snake oil salesman. And a bad one at that!!!
7256 2018-12-21 22:44:49 I once got jalapeño oil in my eye. That was fun
7257 2018-12-21 22:44:45 Palm oil and Sugar.
7258 2018-12-21 22:44:45 赤しいたけさん、前回と会場場所わかりやすくツイート頂けるとうれしいです(..)
7259 2018-12-21 22:44:43 I say "unnecessary" because if we stopped killing innocent people overseas in the name of oil and defense corps, we wouldn't have any enemies worth fighting. Know what I realized? You keep attacking "socialism" because you don't have a real argument to make, Jim...
7260 2018-12-21 22:44:42 Oil worker in the Permian or Bakken fields living in a man camp and driving a company suppled pick up truck.
7261 2018-12-21 22:44:40 I would ask the @TSJ_Legitimo to designate an executive in exile, and recognize it as Maduro's transitional replacement, give it Citgo and proceeds from all oil being delivered to the US to buy food and arm a small army.
7262 2018-12-21 22:44:39 While Stephen flowed
The oil by night
All pumped up from the ground
The manager of Next came down
And convinced him to buy brown 
7263 2018-12-21 22:44:30 BREAKING: #Trump is happy oil prices are low because he can make more trips to Mar-a-Lago on Trump Force One and it won’t look as costly to taxpayers. #TrumpResign
7264 2018-12-21 22:44:17 Yes, nutella for christmas! Why not consume a bunch of murderous palm oil? Yum! Osian doesnt like nutella anymore 
7265 2018-12-21 22:44:08 Showing up to a turn up with no oil in my pen. What an L
7266 2018-12-21 22:44:06 Syria doesn't have oil

7268 2018-12-21 22:43:48 It's not a caricature - Poirot was really like that with the prissy hair oil & patent shoes & waxed moustache....Branagh & Malkovich are to be criticized just as Charlie Laughton & Francis O'Sullivan were - they weren't Poirot!
7269 2018-12-21 22:43:47 Oil prices decline as rate increases lead to concern of weaker crude demand: Crude oil prices fell… @environmentguru
7270 2018-12-21 22:43:47 Not true. GPs, Dentists, Opticians, The BBC, drivers, train travellers, educators, engineers, pharma, water cos, National Grid,  oil & gas, ,  BAE, solicitors, Rolls,  Royce, film makers, pensioners & ISA holders, food retailers, newspapers - all some subsidy. Why not food?
7271 2018-12-21 22:43:33 yeah cause you won’t get my oil changed 
7272 2018-12-21 22:43:32 The US becoming a net exporter of oil, and its $46/bbl price, is not the fault of Trudeau.  That it is being cited as a justification for Alberta secession is perpetrating a fraud on the Canadian people. And to think @AndrewScheer et al. used to call QC separatists traitors.
7273 2018-12-21 22:43:29 Ok, lavender oil applied and cling film over it for tonight. Chemist first thing tomorrow morning to get a proper dressing on it. No more nacho cheese for me.
7274 2018-12-21 22:43:27 “Pass the camomile cleansing oil please”
7275 2018-12-21 22:43:26 Hey @jon_bois - don’t you think the best part of the real Jurassic Park is that it solves the oil crisis for people 65 million years in the future?
7276 2018-12-21 22:43:04 Grateful @VassyKapelos didn't ask Scheer about climate change or the housing crises or income inequality or healthcare or any other issue important to Canadians.  

Oil and pipelines.     Yay for media holding the powerful to account.   #pnpcbc #cdnpoli #bcpoli
7277 2018-12-21 22:42:59 2019 I'm dabbling in oil paintings.
7278 2018-12-21 22:42:55 i gotchu lol. if it’s once it’s probably not bad, the only thing is that there will be glue left on your nails but if you use cuticle oil it should be ok
7279 2018-12-21 22:42:51 @mikexingchen do you know why the hot oil I made might have gelatinized?
7280 2018-12-21 22:42:47 Are you confused now?
You run out of wine?
Do whatever he instruct 
He will fix the scene 

Do you have no oil?
Do you even owe?

He will fill them all

7281 2018-12-21 22:42:42 I have a contrasting story from early as a student, with a very strange pump that had to be switched on to drain the oil: it shot ~3 liters of oil across 2 meters of the room, completely drenching me.
7282 2018-12-21 22:42:39 "As global energy demand increases, 27 per cent of this demand will be met by oil in 2040, the largest single source of energy."
 - Not largest source of energy... Nuclear Power is the best we can get.. Oil/Coal/gas is the least efficient
7283 2018-12-21 22:42:34 I order the cheapest dumbest ish from amazon. You will be pissed of stealing  my organic almond oil and ankle socks.
7284 2018-12-21 22:42:28 Where will we keep the cauldrons of boiling oil?
7285 2018-12-21 22:42:26 Cool! Now do oil spills!
7286 2018-12-21 22:42:21 Where’s the pot of boiling oil and archers with flaming arrows??
7287 2018-12-21 22:42:17 eyeing those crude oil prices like o_o
7288 2018-12-21 22:42:08 Pbr tiene la misma correlación con el oil?
7289 2018-12-21 22:42:04 Snake Oil: it's ineffective and at the same time a waste of money. No one benefits, except the snake-oil salesman. #LyinDonniesMagicElixer #StepRightUp #MAGA
7290 2018-12-21 22:41:51 I was gonna go with boiling oil, but this is better.
7291 2018-12-21 22:41:43 Ok, I guess we're back to, why is this a US problem, more than any other problem area in the world.  Oil, maybe, but few want to say that out loud, and the US is now a net exporter.  And Israel is a nuclear state that doesn't US troops on the ground.  Thanks for the discussion.
7292 2018-12-21 22:41:31 Tried to surprise my mom with an oil change and the dealership sent her an email confirming the appointment 
7293 2018-12-21 22:41:21 And i think the outer shell has an oil that is poisonous if consumed. That's partly why cashews are not sold in a purely raw state.
7294 2018-12-21 22:41:18 WAR should not be in American oil. Once American Military come back home, Putin will reform ISIS 2.0. and Russia will take the Oil.
7295 2018-12-21 22:41:14 To target what exactly? That strategy has been tried over and over with predictable results/outcomes..and is akin to fighting oil fire w/ water..partnered ops is the way to go. Also no such thing as winning..obj should be to maintain balance.
7296 2018-12-21 22:41:08 Its all about access to oil
7297 2018-12-21 22:41:07 She’s not leaking oil she’s sweating purrrrr
7298 2018-12-21 22:40:59 When the oil men get bored , KDB will go to his spiritual home
7299 2018-12-21 22:40:49 Before I throw alot science out here,consider the Bottom Line: 
* Oil drilling in Sec 1002 would destroy the entire area
* Endangered animal species live there ; they will be killed off
* Sec 1002 is one of the MOST important international bird breeding center.

It's 15 miles to the nearest grocery store from home.

Our car costs us almost $400 a month.
Car insurance $130 a month.
License & registration $180 a year

Then we add in gasoline, tires, oil changes, wiper blades, car washes, washer fluid........

7309 2018-12-21 22:39:12 Car in the shop. Gotta fix my baby. Then she need brakes and an oil change. I’ll put the brakes on myself if I can slide to the Mexican homie house, he got all the tools, might do the oil change myself too.
7310 2018-12-21 22:39:09 Boiling oil, from what I can tell.
7311 2018-12-21 22:38:59 JJulie, I so wish you tried CBD Hemp Oil, because up to a month ago and for many years I've been in the same boat as you. But since on Hemp Oil, I swear, chronic headaches are truly a thing of the past. DM me if you wanna talk more about it 
7312 2018-12-21 22:38:52 Winning a war should be measured by accomplishing premeditated goals.  With Iraq’s made up WMDs and Afghanistan’s divided tribes and terrorist cells, those were wars that America could never win.  If we take political rhetoric as the metric of victory, the US lost. Oil? Won.
7313 2018-12-21 22:38:45 My cat knows I’m trying to give him CBD oil....

7318 2018-12-21 22:38:19 Not attending Super Splat Bros afterall, but at least my car got a fresh oil change anyway huhey!
7319 2018-12-21 22:38:18 Thought: It's a Human nature to be emotionally attached to non-living things they care about. Ex. Our bike, books etc. Ex: What does a bike need? A regular maintenance, fuel filled stomach (tank). Who is the user of an engine oil? Is it the owner of the bike or the bike itself?
7320 2018-12-21 22:38:06 Could be wrong but think correlation may change (or has changed already) with oil being smaller part of cad econ now than in past and the US producing more oil now
7321 2018-12-21 22:38:05 Belching flames! Caused by the oil leak?!

Seriously, this is great!

coming from the oil patch !
7329 2018-12-21 22:37:32 According to article QC gets about 50% of oil from Alberta and 50% from US. US oil supply is a mix of US and foreign origin. So it’s probably still accurate to say some oil comes from despotic origins.
7330 2018-12-21 22:37:22 OIL is double fisting at 2 o'clock.

#AnInLawXmas
7331 2018-12-21 22:37:13 Actually oil is correlated with US stock markets. If Trump stop his trade war both will go up strongly.
7332 2018-12-21 22:36:56 Imagine what gas would cost if every politician in congress didn’t take a cut of every oil field they send soldiers over to die for.
7333 2018-12-21 22:36:55 Well over a decade ago, I walked into a top law firm looking for an internship. At the firm, I was asked - 'who is your father?' Today, I am a 'go-to gunslinger' for most of the Seven Sisters. I have become an expert in oil spills defence. Able God!

...not to be dramatic but this issa WHOLE tragedy >.<

7339 2018-12-21 22:36:32 I like to just throw some light oil and seasoning in a pan and sauté
7340 2018-12-21 22:36:31 But the cleanup is going to be heavy lifting...kind of scary...a lot of us are already suffering the effects of this mess. Like I have way less fuel oil for the winter. Wonderful.
7341 2018-12-21 22:36:28 Time to prioritize what’s important. Wasting time on CBD oil is not important.
7342 2018-12-21 22:36:22 Naive! Russia Putin welcomes to do so.  Because Russia will reform ISIS 2.0. and Russia will get the Oil. Russia always wants to control the Oil in Middle-East
7343 2018-12-21 22:36:21 the NBA is a shit-show. What good is a salary cap, if every player on the team can be paid like an oil shiek?
7344 2018-12-21 22:36:09 The Potato Bowl, where a 6-6 team plays a 7-5 team, is made much more compelling by painting the grass blue.
But what would be really compelling would be a pit of boiling oil at midfield.
And maybe giant potato dicers along the sidelines.

7361 2018-12-21 22:34:03 Stop being naive. Syria was never about being humanitarian. It was always about oil and the Saudi pipeline to Mediterranean in order to cripple Russian oil exports.

Please share information and how horrific this would be.
7365 2018-12-21 22:33:35 Yes but #climatechange needs to be fought smarter, not mere pandering to #climate alarmists nor giving cred and $ to IPCC but instead lead by example eg cutting pollution in a smooth shift that enables coal, oil and gas to continue to grow as #cdnpoli and export demands warrant.
7366 2018-12-21 22:33:34 water + coconut oil is a great curl refresher just shake that shit and spray it on
7367 2018-12-21 22:33:33 I am googling that right now. THANK YOU!  I’ve been putting straight coconut oil on my face with my moisturizer because that’s how dry my skin is too. DRASTIC change.

7377 2018-12-21 22:32:32 Once, I sat at a table and explained to some white people how to moisturize. It was a DIY body oil demo. How much is too much, too little, why they should do it, etc.
7378 2018-12-21 22:32:28 He’s a gutless snake oil salesman who thinks that compromise is a canonized virtue rather than one of a set of tools.
7379 2018-12-21 22:32:27 It’s a 2000 Toyota 4Runner. The auto shop originally found one oil leak, which was going to be $150, but then found another one that damaged some other components, which to fix and replace all that would be $950. Then I had to replace my brakes and some other maintenance fees.
7380 2018-12-21 22:32:11 Don't forget daddy cheney wants an oil pipeline from Syria to KSA...troops pull out, he'll lose it.

7382 2018-12-21 22:31:51 I first wash my face either with water or with a cleanser and then i put some witch hazel on a cotton pad and wipe my whole face! It removes left over dirt that the cleanser didnt get and then you moisturize! A few drops of Tea tree oil plus the witch hazel works wonders too!

7387 2018-12-21 22:31:23 Wrong on several counts. Saudi oil is far better than Canadian and Venezuelan heavy oil. Trains have lower emissions per unit transported. But the key point is that less oil will be produced if fewer pipelines are built. #keepitintheground

7389 2018-12-21 22:31:10 Oil dey your head please loud it
7390 2018-12-21 22:30:59 I spend that much in just gas almost.  Not counting car payment, insurance, oil changes, plates....  Terrible.
7391 2018-12-21 22:30:57 They went outside to get oil for thier lamps 
7392 2018-12-21 22:30:42 Eugene Schvidler’s (Russian oil) yacht LeGrand Bleu is in Bart’s.  Steve Winn’s Boat is in St Martin as is Bernard Arnault’s yacht (LV/Moët/Hennessy).
7393 2018-12-21 22:30:23 There are plenty of fish in the sea, but do you know what else is in it? Plastic bags, plastic six-pack rings, and oil spills. Three things that will suffocate you just like all of the fish of my past.
7394 2018-12-21 22:30:20 i used to use argan oil!! and then i ran out.. and haven't restocked. 11/10 would recommend
7395 2018-12-21 22:30:04 There are people with engineering degrees here working at mcdonalds because  nobody's hiring...our oil and gas sector has been crippled here ..economies dictate unemployment...i cant even get a second job because they want someone younger ...meanwhile my hours are being cut
7396 2018-12-21 22:30:00 Definitely, it's a natural oil packed with vitamins and suitable for this harmattan season too
7397 2018-12-21 22:29:57 Tryna slick a can of oil.... who you think you foolin
7398 2018-12-21 22:29:54 Big risk that could happen but counting on Haynesville closing. If oil prices linger or drop further for 2-3 months, no way Williston deal gets done.
7399 2018-12-21 22:29:51 Since you’re more knowledgeable about tech and also technology than anyone else, I’m sure you’ve thought about where to stage the large vats of boiling oil to pour down upon the enemy and their children but I don’t see the staging area in your picture.
7400 2018-12-21 22:29:51 Change the needle or oil the machine
7401 2018-12-21 22:29:49 Cause they put motor oil on it
7402 2018-12-21 22:29:32 Germany is the EU. You say put your foot down with sanctions but the EU is not going to and they are next door! Again, if they are not worried about Russia, and they live next door and pay for the military through oil purchases, why am I as an American worried about it?
7403 2018-12-21 22:29:16 GOP Record:
Oil Recession (73-74)- Nixon
Iran/Energy (81-82)- Reagan
Inflation/Debt (90-91)- HW Bush
Dot Com Bust (01)- W Bush
Great Recession (07-09)- W Bush

*Worst DOW week since '08 & worst December since the Great Depression; DOW down 9% for the year.

=19-Trump Recession
7404 2018-12-21 22:29:05 Oil Money for all Democrats who want it....
Who will be first to develop green oil? It's not impossible, it's just not done, because its too cheap. Not enough profits for executives.
7405 2018-12-21 22:29:04 他国の前大統領がサンタに扮してその国の子供にプレゼントあげたとか、朝一番のニュースで取り上げることか…一体なんのニュースなんだ…
7406 2018-12-21 22:28:53 Sorry, I've lost your point: Are you asserting that oil can't have an abiogenic origin because the consensus is that it's a fossil fuel? Or are you just unsure what you're arguing about?
7407 2018-12-21 22:28:48 There has been enough blood split in foreign lands for globalist bullshit agenda for oil and gas
7408 2018-12-21 22:28:46  listen mannn it’s the oil sheen
7409 2018-12-21 22:28:42 How to get creamed' if you related to Haiti vote crisis: 'These charges only £10 notes. Criminals like my hand at oil facility
7410 2018-12-21 22:28:42 i can’t imagine the false information conveyed by Tati in her last few videos  If I have to guess, I’d say that she’d be talking smack about mineral oil, parabens, silicones and alcohol 
7411 2018-12-21 22:28:14 That's a very good list. Small bite oil adoption across the Non-OECD (lots of new users still to come online likely with small engine or short-trip demand) is my key growth risk for oil. And then NG in powergen, not just OECD but also China.
7412 2018-12-21 22:28:08 It’s not dirt it’s human oil lol
7413 2018-12-21 22:28:07 The world revolves around oil and drugs...….we have most of the oil in the world and pot is legal...….can't make ends meet....laughing stock of this globe...good job @JustinTrudeau
7414 2018-12-21 22:27:59 I'll be back on later. My brain tumor decided to pound earlier. This tumor is in my Acoustic Canal. I gave it a dose of My Cannabis Oil and it stopped but now I'm so fucked up my keyboard on my phone is a huge blur.
7415 2018-12-21 22:27:52 My dad had off today & he rlly cleaned my car in/out, changed my oil & put gas in my car. He’s the real MVP I appreciate him sooo much #daddysgirlforlife #MerryChristmasToMe

7418 2018-12-21 22:27:39 Trump wants a monetized paramilitary. From the early years of the Iraq war, HE wanted oil as comp. He is a marauder who seeks to plunder those who don't 'pay' their fair share. No concept of global politics.

#US #Military, best on this planet, NOT FOR SALE.

7419 2018-12-21 22:27:30 Please look again at his record; he started illegal wars and drastically increased the wealth gap. He did very little for most of us; was very generous to the 1%, big oil and big pharma.
7420 2018-12-21 22:27:28 Gangaa!!!!! Then iron Lady (Indira)
7421 2018-12-21 22:27:25 I be so annoyed when it’s time to get an oil change

7423 2018-12-21 22:27:23 Will you like to try Palm kernel Oil?
7424 2018-12-21 22:27:22 If I had my way, oil would be a thing of the past. I refer to containing the spread of Daesh.
7425 2018-12-21 22:27:17 Its gotta be something very serious that we do not know about to keep Ryan and many other Republicans silent about the evil surrounding Donald.  I think it has something to do w/$ plus the oil find by Russia in the Arctic Circle?
7426 2018-12-21 22:27:12 Van a bajar y te vas a tener que tragar tus palabras con un sorbo de gas.oil.
7427 2018-12-21 22:27:07 This vegan chef is on ig telling people to put tea tree oil in their vagina on a tampon and everyone in the comments said sis wyd that would burn and she was like 'read the comments, I said dilute it' like they were the foolish ones
7428 2018-12-21 22:27:04 That’s good to hear man and I’m just chillin as well. Gotta get an oil change that’s about to take an hour to an hour an a half which I’m kinda beat about
7429 2018-12-21 22:26:59 what's better for dry skin? coconut oil, avocado oil or argan oil?
7430 2018-12-21 22:26:59 They were yummy! I used your olive oil to toss them in a bag of salt, pepper, diced onions and your fresh garlic & served with your peppercorn tenderloin, broccoli casserole, & glazed carrots! YUM! Sorry no pic. We were hungry lol
7431 2018-12-21 22:26:57 Our government has no regard for human rights home or abroad. The wars are about selling arms and stealing resources for private gain. Oil. Heroin.
7432 2018-12-21 22:26:46 What car you got? My dad has had oil leaks from the engine in his car before but at the most had to spend around $100-$200. Depends on the auto shop though.
7433 2018-12-21 22:26:43 Oil dey your head Bruh
7434 2018-12-21 22:26:19 The hot oil is in the cauldrons ready, my Lord. 
7435 2018-12-21 22:26:14 I can locate anywhere in the world with a wet cooling tower and guarantee an oil temp of 35C and chip temps of 70C. Lower with direct cooling. Dry cooling is also available, but the chips would run hotter as you are limited by the dry bulb temp, instead of wet bulb
7436 2018-12-21 22:26:12 The pledge wasn’t contributions over a limit, but contributions over a limit /from oil company execs/. There’s no check box on activeblue for “I work at an oil company and am an exec,” though. You can’t stop the donation, you can only review it later and maybe return it.
7437 2018-12-21 22:26:06 Changin da oil to my girls car who ain’t even my girl but she my girl so ima take care of this one 4 her

7442 2018-12-21 22:25:33 Yes, the oil is from his land
7443 2018-12-21 22:25:28 cooking oil is a bullshit point with Iran and Russia occupying syria
7444 2018-12-21 22:25:20 Saturn SC2 Coop. I had to put in oil literally every week to keep it running. It was my commuter car to the U, too. Rough times..
7445 2018-12-21 22:25:18 @Shell no thanks! #climatechange #seismicblasting #polarbears #whales how about stay out of the #arctic for oil drilling & exploration? Thanks
7446 2018-12-21 22:25:01 Yeah right Richard, they want the corporate oil industry bonus, after all US military is about invasion, war and pirating resources from countries that want to remain independent of the US corporate military.. Most of the Middle East countries would appreciate terrorist go home!!
7447 2018-12-21 22:24:53 Always the salesman...
...snake oil, fences, and despair.
7448 2018-12-21 22:24:41 Got an oil change for 13.49..cant beat that
7449 2018-12-21 22:24:34 Yes, it also works well with direct seawater cooling. Oil temps would be near ideal at 20C which would result in chip temps of ~55C.
7450 2018-12-21 22:24:24 imagine, the Saudis got only oil yet see how fine they're living. in Nigeria we got OIL, AGRICULTURE and many other mineral resources yet many of NIGERIANS are starving
At this stage it's obvious our leaders are evil and unqualified to be in the positions they occupy. @segalink
7451 2018-12-21 22:24:24 In the future if I have to pay my own rent, pay every single bill, feed myself, change my tires, get myself an oil change, I WILL. ALONE. Lol not with a MAN in the house.

7458 2018-12-21 22:24:02 No, I still think they folks who are sheep and believe the snake oil salesman.
7459 2018-12-21 22:23:47 Oh, no, I know people who have them. And who have both. All it takes is some nice hot water heated by the aforementioned oil.
7460 2018-12-21 22:23:45 Get over yourself mukka, nothing will change, EU country's need to trade as you of all people know, they like to buy our goods as we like to buy theirs! Stop worrying, plane's will fly (drone attacks aside) wine, cheese, olive's and olive oil will still be in our shops!
7461 2018-12-21 22:23:31 Well what do you have to say about those who would call you a science denying conspiracy nut? After all Monsanto's scientists claim its safe.... I wish we'd do that. Gmos are in everything now. Once corn and canola are modified their oil is used to make a lot food products...
7462 2018-12-21 22:23:28 @PnPCBC  With humanity facing it's greatest challenge,Climate Deterioration, Albertans want to churn out more dirty,low grade oil, that nobody wants to buy, not even China. The hot pursuit of self interest trumps the welfare of future generations. Food insufficiency is the future

7472 2018-12-21 22:22:06 Because it's time to oil up.
7473 2018-12-21 22:22:03 Interesting, but why is oil T and oil P shown on opposite sides of the dash?.... I’d have them together so that you can see what is going on in one place in one scan.

7476 2018-12-21 22:21:46 I’ve been sitting here waiting on my oil change for HOURS.. nobody even here 
7477 2018-12-21 22:21:37 Dust them in cornflour before tossing in the oil & then cooking them like oven chips. Gives them a cruchy outside.
7478 2018-12-21 22:21:27 I'd be okay with boiling oil... nobody boils oil on their walls anymore...
7479 2018-12-21 22:21:24 I cleared all my teenage acne that carried into my 30's with the use of 100% lavender oil & tee tree oils, have'nt enough space to tell how but google it & find how to do face wash, toner & moisturer but do invest in a facial scrub brush,, all works better than any medical aid

7490 2018-12-21 22:20:11 @PnPCBC  Mr. Scheer blames Trudeau for Oil companies pulling out of the Oil Sands. He misinforms once again. They pulled out because the Oil Sands is not economically a feasible enterprise. Government subsidies(taxpayer money) keeps it afloat.
7491 2018-12-21 22:20:05 My supervisor has a story about a pump during his postdoc that seized up after 3 years w/o an oil change, and all the oil was completely polymerized inside
7492 2018-12-21 22:20:05 Sorted oil and filter change, plugs out and turn her over and carbs back on. Just waiting on plugs and fuel pump then

7494 2018-12-21 22:19:38 In Athens, Alabama where I just spent $1.979/gallon on gasoline. Big kudos to @realDonaldTrump and the U.S. oil industry for making this moment possible.
7495 2018-12-21 22:19:33 On the plus-side.. I’m beginning to be able to smell the olbas oil. On the down-side, I just rubbed it in my eye. #Flu #TheRealThing
7496 2018-12-21 22:19:28 1 cup of rice/2 cups of water +hella adobo/garlic powder (whatever u have it just makes it flavorful when its done) & a lil olive oil, stir it up n let it boil for like 2 mins, turn it way down &let it simmer with the lid on but leave a lil crack for the steam to escape

7505 2018-12-21 22:18:14 You let people come on CNBC and predict oil going up to $70 a barrel by the end of the year .. why do you do that! Screen your "experts" .. economies in the world are going down - oil production is increasing

7511 2018-12-21 22:17:39 Agreed. Everyone is backtracking the prices they just raised in September
7512 2018-12-21 22:17:33 How does invading countries with oil, propping up dictators and funding Islamic fundamentalists protecting our country again?
7513 2018-12-21 22:17:28 I think @BrianMulroney4  idea on our oil. No oil on our waters and just for Canadians until we make a transition to alternate energy sources!   Doesn't Ottawa have the right to go through QUEBEC?!
7514 2018-12-21 22:17:27 When I were a nipper all we had for breakfast was a seller of snake oil, and we were lucky if we got a brick in the forehead for dinner!
7515 2018-12-21 22:17:25 Next time mix it up a bit. Buy some plastic wrap, rope, a lighter, duct tape, and some baby oil and let her imagination run wild.

Welcome to the rabbit hole. 
7519 2018-12-21 22:16:44 Do you know where to get replacements? Some Hardware stores ,but years ago, we had a store in Halifax long-since gone, but I found a new place, Wood-stove-oil-tank store where Motel was removed, bottom of Burnside 'Value Sales' In case you are looking.

7523 2018-12-21 22:16:38 My eyes have been opened to what a corporate sellout @BarackObama really was: record highs in oil and gas production, a halfass #ACA with no price protections or public option, continuing existing wars and started #Syria with the #CIA. We need real progressives with...

7525 2018-12-21 22:16:37 A Christmas list as an adult consist of an oil change... or an alignment.... or a brake check... or basically all the adult things and responsibilities I’ve put aside bc I’ve gone crazy baby shopping
7526 2018-12-21 22:16:34 So by “our side” you must mean the donors: billionaires, wall st., big pharma, oil companies, etc. 
Well then go ahead and add my name to that list too.
7527 2018-12-21 22:16:30 This either sucked in something really nasty that got cooked inside the pump or worst there is a mechanical friction inside the pump that chipped away metallic powder inside the oil. If it means anything to you I pray for you it is first option.
7528 2018-12-21 22:16:23 Nope you can make it with oil or vegan butter substitutes
7529 2018-12-21 22:16:23 Nonsense. CDNs have reduced per capita GHGs by 18% since 2006. CDN GHGs R down from 740Mt to 705Mt since then yet the economy is 25% bigger.  If we'd made no progress our GHGs would be > 900Mt.  We R also a huge oil exporter to the USA. They burn it, let them wear GHG cost
7530 2018-12-21 22:16:19 How could much of what CNBC puts on Air be happening .. letting "analysts" come on and predict $70 a barrel oil by the end of the year when economies are going down and  productions are going UP!
7531 2018-12-21 22:16:18 The Green New Deal didn’t have legislation attached yet, but I’m glad you’re so gung ho about protecting Dems’ ability to be bought by oil.
7532 2018-12-21 22:16:17 Hi tweeps,
We are giving out 5kg bag of rice and 1 litre bottle of oil to families who cannot afford food this Christmas.
If you see anyone around, kindly send in their locations and we will get to them.

7533 2018-12-21 22:16:14 Check your Engine oil today.
7534 2018-12-21 22:16:10 Hi Alex. No. 2016 GDP was **$70B** less than forecast in summer 2015. 

The Bank of Canada governor famously said in *spring* 2015 that the oil shock was "front loaded" and behind us.

So, the 2016 GDP shock was not foreseen by anyone I know.
7535 2018-12-21 22:15:55 #Brent: $53.49 (-1.58%)

7536 2018-12-21 22:15:44 Is Putin happy because Trump is going to invade Iran?  Putin wants their oil.  Also, Netanyahu has been silent.
7537 2018-12-21 22:15:34 Brings the car for an oil change, dude recommended $1700.00 worth of shit that needs to be done. How about we apply this oil change coupon and I’ll just bring it back.
7538 2018-12-21 22:15:33 Just two months,oil price fall down from 85 USD to 53 USD ........
7539 2018-12-21 22:15:28 ISIS made by you America and your CIA you creat this monster in Iraq and Syria and you have to take the moral responsibility of it , destroy countries,killed people just for oil and protect Israel
7540 2018-12-21 22:15:02 What unity is there in letting people who get paid to make oil profitable board an actual climate policy committee? 
Do you want 'unity' in the Democratic party or unity in actually taking action? 

There won't be 'unity' if 2/3 of the members resist every piece of legislation
7541 2018-12-21 22:14:59 i should be banned from pep boys for how often i don't show up to my oil change appointments
7542 2018-12-21 22:14:51 I 100% need an oil in my skincare routine this time of year cuz dang what a difference
7543 2018-12-21 22:14:49 Because the majority of Australians want action on #climatechange and investment in #renewables.  The alt right has an addiction to #coal and will lie to the Australian public to try and snake oil sell it to us.
7544 2018-12-21 22:14:41 @NancyPelosi 

People who take money from oil industry donors have a conflict of interest on climate change and regulation of fossil fuels. 

It’s not a free speech issue. Period.
7545 2018-12-21 22:14:40 It mostly oil so...
7546 2018-12-21 22:14:34 えっ、なんかそれはそれで嬉しいような複雑な気持ちです()
是非ともお話したいです!!語り合いたいです！
7547 2018-12-21 22:14:31 If Canada exported its own oil the dollar would be at least 5 cents better off. Maybe higher.
7548 2018-12-21 22:14:29 When you post a picture titled "Brussels EU" Dictatorship, that lists Drug and Oil Cartels at the top, you reveal yourself to be a batshit crazy lunatic. Go talk to Alex Jones about Jewish conspiracies, or David Icke about lizard people. Good bye.
7549 2018-12-21 22:14:26 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
7550 2018-12-21 22:14:25 Our oil is bloody expensive to get out of the ground. We benefitted with the US being so close, not sure how this becomes feasible selling to China.
7551 2018-12-21 22:13:59 Canada is no better. Here the government is pushing through the building of a mega oil pipeline! In a sense the people in our country are also responsible, as we elect those parties in. There are much better alternatives, but they have never been elected. #FutureOfOurPlanet
7552 2018-12-21 22:13:58 This soup! Red lentils with lots of spices like cumin, cinnamon, middle eastern spices, chillies, fresh ginger, , chickpeas, lamb meatballs, Brussels sprouts, chard, yogurt lemon added at end, olive oil and garlic browned croutons........ @ Waterlooville
7553 2018-12-21 22:13:41 Yeah, they don’t really have that much oil. You’re kinda expecting $3-4bn to go a long way.
7554 2018-12-21 22:13:40 Must be public school's teaching this stuff!!! Coal and oil are good you libtards!!! How can polllution  be bad if it's not new ?? Doesn't even make sense at all
7555 2018-12-21 22:13:32 Cookies. Motor oil. Movies. Whatever.
7556 2018-12-21 22:13:29 Anyone need an oil change? Lmk, I got good deals 
7557 2018-12-21 22:13:22 To bad ... Canada just couldn’t sell more products to get more royalties to like .... pay this shit off ....... hum ....... like ..... gee I don’t know ..... ummm ficcck  .......OIL
7558 2018-12-21 22:13:21 This sustained selling reminds me of the Oil market.
See you at -40% Nasdaq
7559 2018-12-21 22:13:20 It’s money from Coutinho’s sale we don’t have oil money
7560 2018-12-21 22:13:17 soo good & freshhhh! manchu shit be looking like they fry it in rat oil
7561 2018-12-21 22:13:15 Not sure "greener" and more oil development can occur at the same time.
7562 2018-12-21 22:13:10 So,

Old and broke: Big Oil

New and Woke: Big Weed?
7563 2018-12-21 22:13:07 Current beta is -0.43. Long TLT, Gold, UNG, XLU, VNQ and USD. I'm short Euro's, Sterling, Copper, Oil, Russel and Corn. Each sized on vol.
7564 2018-12-21 22:12:56 Next time go to Walmart very early, have them change your oil and you happily browse or do your shopping for 45 mins. problem solved.
7565 2018-12-21 22:12:44 Put a new battery in the Mustang. Old battery had gone dead despite having it on a tender. Taking her cruising for a few hours this solstice. Really need to take every opportunity to get her out of the garage in winter, if only to keep the oil circulating.
7566 2018-12-21 22:12:38 Oh, so big oil and other big corporations don't lobby and try to leverage state politicians, just federal ones?

7568 2018-12-21 22:12:33 You turned hardworkung real Canadians into wefare recipients!
Libs are anti oil anti Canadian!
7569 2018-12-21 22:12:30 Beto literally got removed from the "no fossil fuel money pledge" for doing exactly that, not for taking a couple bucks from a bunch of salt-of-the-earth gas station attendants and oil field workers.
7570 2018-12-21 22:12:27 Water and coconut oil are all I really need
7571 2018-12-21 22:12:25 I am a business person. A problem ghat can I be solved is the ideal business opportunity. It drives continuous demand. 

China is already using our oil and gas to build renewable technology. Why aren’t WE using our oil to build renewable tech? Why give them the opportunity?
7572 2018-12-21 22:12:22 I only learned that this summer. The isolate is the most economical way to get high amounts of cbd. Then you can make your own tincture with oil. I just add mine together in my mouth to get every drop.
7573 2018-12-21 22:12:18 Thank you Art. Truth is painful. Especially when a large share of my income is from oil/gas royalties. Next few months will be interesting
7574 2018-12-21 22:12:07 I was at the hair salon and I was scared af because I lost a lot of hair...the lady asked me if I was under stress....whoa that made sense, well more coconut oil, more sleep and not letting the other old lady to touch my hair...NEVER.
7575 2018-12-21 22:12:03 Yea same and I have oil and my homie has the syringes too but I don’t want those lmao
7576 2018-12-21 22:12:00 I'd rather spend my time disputing misinformation, laughing at snake oil salesman, and doing my best to show the rest of Canada that my province is not made up entirely of uneducated rubes, thanks.
7577 2018-12-21 22:11:56 My Aphria CBD oil is coming on the 27th but I could’ve had it today if I chose fedex instead of Canada post </3
7578 2018-12-21 22:11:49 iron, copper, coal, zinc, oil, sulfur and saltpeter...
7579 2018-12-21 22:11:43 You missed the fact that the industry got lazy with basically 1 client buying almost all its product. This is about US finding oil and basically screwing us. AND it is not guaranteed that any pipeline will create the desired revenue from Asian markets.
7580 2018-12-21 22:11:38 The Abrams tank doesn't need fossil fuels.
It's Honeywell AGT1500 gas turbine engine can run on used cooking oil, AKA Biodiesel.
7581 2018-12-21 22:11:32 Boo Hoo Israel can't stomp their feet and get their much wanted pipeline. It's all about OIL and $$$. Start following International Law and get out of where you don't belong.
7582 2018-12-21 22:11:31 Speaking of the CNOOC deal, did they ever make a mistake on buying into the oil sands at $100 oil, still no pipeline, good for China!! #pnpcbc
7583 2018-12-21 22:11:25 Why isn’t anyone talking about Trump’s intentions toward Iran? The troop withdrawals are a a precursor to that.  Why do you think Putin is so happy?  He needs the US Army to steal Iran’s oil for him.  Why has Netanyahu been silent?  The border wall is a smoke screen.
7584 2018-12-21 22:11:22 Midnight Oil - Helps Me Helps You
7585 2018-12-21 22:11:21 ...and if you are wrong, which you are, humanity & other species will suffer badly. If we should be wrong, which we are not, the worst that would happen is that the oil, gas and coal industries will succumb to market forces a few years earlier than they would naturally.
2/
7586 2018-12-21 22:11:20 STorms are caused by coal from N Americas largest coal port in Vancouver- near ferry terminal &DSuzuki mansion Then coal is burnt overseas and Karma- it returns to BC as extreme weather. Ask the Whistler guy, its how it is. wait I meant Alberta oil and gas - not BC coal.sshhh
7587 2018-12-21 22:11:19 Then eat honey, olive oil is also great and drink hot tea everyday before sleep, wear a scarf and cover your neck outside 
Take care of your health 
7588 2018-12-21 22:11:18 tea tree oil is beautiful.
7589 2018-12-21 22:11:05 Well, as one proud Scottish guy told me: We got England's Nukes and it's oil....
7590 2018-12-21 22:11:03 Oil's Well is better than The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
7591 2018-12-21 22:10:54 i was excited for oil paints because they dont dry so fast. but now that im done. and its still wet. i dont know what to do with it.
7592 2018-12-21 22:10:44 Actually the Koch's are employing another bait & switch when it comes to regulations.

No regulations allow for Big Oil & Kochs to have privatized profits while leaving the cost of business on the shoulders of tax payers.
7593 2018-12-21 22:10:39    Worst December for the 'Stock Market' since 1931.  Worst Free Fall in  stock prices since the Crash in 2008.

7600 2018-12-21 22:09:35 If you think Halliburton had more pull than oil concerns, you’ve been wildly misinformed.
7601 2018-12-21 22:09:31 Why does LOS owe Eli a ?? Because his brother played here?  New rule guys, all family members of all ring of honor inductees are now owed a standing ovation at Lucas Oil. Hell, where’s Cooper? Maybe we bring him down from the luxury suites and give him a standing O. 
7602 2018-12-21 22:09:24 いやあやはり好きを語れる相手が居なかったから嬉しい限りです、今後ともよろしくお願いしますm(_ _)m
7603 2018-12-21 22:09:17 So much nope, Chris. 

Once lived through a -22F blast in Indiana. Flexible stuff hardens & breaks. Motor oil is glue. Grease is JBWeld. Tires get flat spots that have to be rolled out. 

Nopeity nope nope.
7604 2018-12-21 22:09:16 Is that oil on his arms 
7605 2018-12-21 22:09:02 Tem vários, mas de preferência pede um oil free, geralmente são feitos de ureia, hidrata e não deixa oleoso, que é um dos causadores de espinhas
7606 2018-12-21 22:08:54 I like them because they sound healthier than the usual order of potato plus oil.
7607 2018-12-21 22:08:48 Do you oppose the oil industry too? Because if so I only see gas cars driving in NYC and not much electric cars (except for some MTA buses). Bring in more electric cars for regular day people by giving them a credit of $25k so then they can buy one
7608 2018-12-21 22:08:35 Whole that is true he’s managed to give Iran the land bridge to the Mediterranean that they’ve always sought.  Between that fact and those asinine exemptions he granted for buying Iranian oil, how much more can he do for them?  He’s reached a new low on the stupidity scale
7609 2018-12-21 22:08:35 Don't let the midnight oil burn low.
No, don't let it burn out.
Let's see how things turn out,
In the end


7610 2018-12-21 22:08:31 Sad to see @waitrose Christmas pudding by @HMBlumenthal contains palm oil, an ingredient only found in factory processed food and directly implicated in the destruction of rainforests and imminent extinction of orangutans. Happy Christmas @RainforestResq
7611 2018-12-21 22:08:18 When oil went below $40 - what was CAD then?
7612 2018-12-21 22:08:14 Got my oil changed,  filled my tank up , washed my car and ate wingstoppppp
7613 2018-12-21 22:07:55 Too bad all that "output" from a barrel of oil is mostly in the USA....

Also, I somehow doubt you're "facts sheet" is factual..  I haven't looked at it yet... but I know the FACTS are not something you would be promoting
7614 2018-12-21 22:07:32 "ugh. This fucking fuckboi keeps leaving his expensive underwear all over the place. STOP LEAVING YOUR DICK IN THE SINK! YOUR KEEP DRIPPING OIL ON THE FLOOR!"
7615 2018-12-21 22:07:02 taking goldenseal, oil of oregano, and emergen-c. bye bye sickness!
7616 2018-12-21 22:06:52 Exactly as my previous tweet. Old guys in old companies and I would have added they are also in $Oil
7617 2018-12-21 22:06:45 食パンさんおはようございます！
7618 2018-12-21 22:06:41 Sorry. Russia and China now have control of the the Middle East. The only other big oil is Canada, which is why Russia built up it’s force off the coast of Canada just before Trump was elected. The U.S. is now just cheap labor. Arrogance has it’s price.
7619 2018-12-21 22:06:38 It's not about the oil.
It's about the minerals.
It's about the superb quality diamonds.
7620 2018-12-21 22:06:32 I called out the snake oil salesman.

Created tools that generate an edge, do this full time, and apparently Im a hypocrite. Okay man. Yeah im not sharing my years of work for free.
7621 2018-12-21 22:06:28 Everytime I come to get an oil change I have nails in multiple tires. Why? I don’t understand.
7622 2018-12-21 22:06:23 hot deep-frying oil: *pops at me*
me: this is fine :)
7623 2018-12-21 22:06:18 Just got home from work with no rice and oil, hmm
7624 2018-12-21 22:06:09 Dont know about that , my father has worked in the oil fields since he was 18 and retired a multimillionaire with his earnings by saving and also his 401k and IRA investments . Making 6 figures for 75% of his working career , I wouldn't mind retiring at 49 like he did
7625 2018-12-21 22:06:08 Standard I’ll get the baby oil
7626 2018-12-21 22:06:04 I've worked with children with disabilities for years and the shit people will try to *sell* to them and their parents is worse imo. Everything from snake oil sales to surgeons doing risky/unnecessary/ineffective surgeries.
7627 2018-12-21 22:06:02 All of our power comes from the sun, including coal and oil.
7628 2018-12-21 22:06:02 Right. And what did you do before you ran for president? Beto's more qualified than a two-bit reality show host and all-round snake oil salesman named Donald Trump.
7629 2018-12-21 22:06:00 i expose frauds and liars - see QPP ( commended by regulators), GBO, the china frauds, CUP, SER, GKP & dozens of others . Its my job and am good at it. You want to ignore my warnings then you will lose ££ on #FRR. I am right & a trained oil analyst. you are a moron

7634 2018-12-21 22:05:44 Just like oil and water, oil is always repelled and it cant mix inside the water.
7635 2018-12-21 22:05:30 When you pull your bird out, pour out the liquid and separate the fat from the juice. Measure fat and add more oil or butter as needed and an equal amount of flour. Proportions are 2 T fat and 2 T flour and add 1 cup of liquid to roux to produce 1 cup gravy.
7636 2018-12-21 22:05:30 I am visualizing bags of oil based paint and portable catapults.
7637 2018-12-21 22:05:25 Big oil get the hell out of my life.... We got ways to run things without oil....
7638 2018-12-21 22:05:25 Gillies, you AGW deniers have your jumbled belief system(s), and we have our evidence base, well-established and robust science. You believe that the oil, coal and gas industries should continue to grow until the bitter end. You are in a small minority, and if ...

7639 2018-12-21 22:05:14 Bottom line is Alberta has a GDP of about $360B. Norway about $460B. Sumilar pop ratio. Norway seems to do just fine, so with Alberta’s massive oil reserves, Alberta would do just fine. Especially without Quebec siphoning billions.
7640 2018-12-21 22:05:08 Is this another @JustinTrudeau lie??  He said Quebec doesn’t want Alberta oil so just Saudi oil

7642 2018-12-21 22:05:03 Only on King Ranch & XIT. You also have Mexican food &, in Houston, oil. But none of these is the Official State Smell.

Barbecue!! A slab of brisket slow smokin’ in a pit!! You smell that, you KNOW you’re in Texas.

PS - If you’re eating BBQ now, add 25 Cool Points. 
7643 2018-12-21 22:05:02 My big fear is that with crude demand undershooting supply this year (with all the hybrids/evs), we are seeing a desperate coordinated attack on $TSLA stock to slow that down. Between Big Oil and Big Auto, they can easily pound the bid at will with small portion of their wealth.
7644 2018-12-21 22:04:53 Those fossil fuel donations were mostly from small donors. Individual people who happen to work for oil companies. And would you believe that there happen to be a lot of people who work for oil companies in Texas?

7647 2018-12-21 22:04:26 Higher interest rates, declining oil prices,  and war not to mention lack of confidence in the White House  by the entire world. Your spewing nonsense.

7655 2018-12-21 22:03:14 Every time I think my job can't get better it does. My PI has a fine arts minor and OIL PAINTS in his free time like ok art and science could I fit in here any better???
7656 2018-12-21 22:03:11 This has anything to do with the First Amendment, but I do wonder whether barring anyone who has taken oil company money calls for an impractical degree of ideological purity.
7657 2018-12-21 22:02:58 Kasich is and has always been a typical member of the GOP. Anti-women, anti-local control over gas/oil, anti-environment. I always marveled when people told me he was “different”- HE IS THE SAME!
7658 2018-12-21 22:02:53 Zach and I are getting the oil change in his truck and he farts in the lobby and turns to me all serious and says “I think I just shit myself” 
7659 2018-12-21 22:02:51 Having a full tank of gas and a fresh oil change feels so good, but at what cost?
7660 2018-12-21 22:02:47 I’ve tried coconut oil.. I’ll try Vaseline next time so I don’t scrub my skin off again
7661 2018-12-21 22:02:47 @POTUS  it is a mistake to aleign ourselves with Turkey/Erdogan, he bought oil from ISIS @ 50% of it's value, funding their war machine; he is not a friend of ally; Kurdish people are, let's not betray them, they are a friend of Israel also.
7662 2018-12-21 22:02:46 That was Rudolph's naughty brother! Don't cross the Spider! Ha ha! Ding dong merrily on Fa la la la laa la la la Wenscleslas!
7663 2018-12-21 22:02:37 i just spent an hour watching videos of people teaching how to varnish oil paintings. am i an artist? no. is it extremely satisfying? yes.
7664 2018-12-21 22:02:34 @USRepKCastor Money still talks. We can't afford any more oil spills nor pollution, but apparently if slipped the right amount of money, you will turn your head. We need more like Alexandria and less of people like you. Heartless.
7665 2018-12-21 22:02:34 To enforce the trade of oil in USD. Sorry Iran. Not allowed to sell your own product in the currency of your choice.
7666 2018-12-21 22:02:24 They make great progress for bankers,  oil execs, insurance execs, the military industrial complex, and that ilk so... progress making them progressive.
7667 2018-12-21 22:02:22 Which one did you use?
I just bought tamanu oil and tea tree.  but haven't use it yet.
7668 2018-12-21 22:02:15 For Death Watch, something to consider is perhaps drybrushing - Spray Black Drybrush your dark grey highlights. paint in the silver bits including the ribbing on the armour - wash the whole thing with nuln oil and then any areas that need tidying up block back in with black
7669 2018-12-21 22:02:11 Oil
7670 2018-12-21 22:02:11 I hate coming to get my oil changed
7671 2018-12-21 22:02:02 透き通った鎖→サヨナラの合図も個人的に捨てがたいです(*´﹃`*)
7672 2018-12-21 22:01:57 There is a huge population of sea otters in California. Many people are worried about an oil spill occurring and killing the wild life there. They are trying to look into re locating the animal to save their numbers today.
7673 2018-12-21 22:01:52 Kanye is in the Illuminati! So is Jay-Z! Beyonce isn’t though! The electric car was killed by Walt Disney! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
7674 2018-12-21 22:01:43 Das 'Oil on Water'-Shirt ist ein Traum! Bin sehr spät dran, aber falls es niemand haben wollte, ich würde es nehmen 
7675 2018-12-21 22:01:42 [the Apocalypse happens]

Last friend on Earth: How can you sit there and be so relaxed in the face of disaster????

Me, legs propped up, hands behind my head: Well I think we'll be just fine after I remembered someone gave me this "essential" oil. I'm set.
7676 2018-12-21 22:01:33 Bouta b off this oil gotta eat first tho ... But what to eat 
7677 2018-12-21 22:01:32 I did this before and my nipple was in 2  omg just use some black castor oil 2-3 times a day and you can use a small bandage if you want but the skin will mend together in about 2 weeks
7678 2018-12-21 22:01:14 orange oil is highly flammable so yeah probabLY
7679 2018-12-21 22:01:07 Put a couple of drops of oregano oil in a shot glass with water and shoot it back.  Works like a charm!
7680 2018-12-21 22:00:55 If anyone wants to get me a gift, get me an oil change.
7681 2018-12-21 22:00:48 Chicken: spinach, artichoke heart, sun-dried tomato, garlic and olive oil, Fusilli
7682 2018-12-21 22:00:41 RT @LivingSafely: General Mills #Bugles this December? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.
7683 2018-12-21 22:00:30 Shut off those subsidies to big oil. There your money for your wall.
7684 2018-12-21 22:00:28 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
7685 2018-12-21 22:00:27 December 21, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
7686 2018-12-21 22:00:22 Your also pretty funny if you think it's just the Democratic Party..... who do you think Big Oil lobbies more, Dems or Pubs. Of course Pubs (tax cuts), overwhelmingly.

Social Democrats are trying to put a stop to the crony socialism of corporate politicians.
7687 2018-12-21 22:00:22 Nothing but a snake oil salesman.
7688 2018-12-21 22:00:21 Please bring back the "gurus" who predicted oil would be $70 a barrel by the end of the year and have them explain .. thank you.
7689 2018-12-21 22:00:09 You really have no idea how regulated the oil industry is or how many communities in places along the gulf coast depend on it.
7690 2018-12-21 22:00:05 That’s so sad  It’s hard for me to tell whether or not the oil is working. Though my dog hasn’t had a seizure in months, his seizures aren’t regular - he’s gone months without seizures *without* CBD oil. All we can hope for is for him to never have a seizure again...
7691 2018-12-21 22:00:04 it's a fully sealed chamber + paper filter. Super high pressure and minimal oil transfer into the actual coffee concentrate it produces

7694 2018-12-21 21:59:28 @EKOnFAM turned me onto cold pressed hemp seed oil and that has also helped me kill inflammation!  Tumeric is wonderful (but make sure you take with black pepper for anyone who's never tried)
7695 2018-12-21 21:59:26 my oil is literally oozing out of me, i'm so horny for a hot piece of hummer ass

7701 2018-12-21 21:58:51 maggie got me this roller oil de-stress shit and i’m pretty sure it’s the bees knees... or maybe it’s the whole placebo affect either way damn yah girl is relaxeeeeed
7702 2018-12-21 21:58:42 Oh seen, got ya. Was your first one in 2 years. Don't worry about the oil, grease is good sometimes 
7703 2018-12-21 21:58:37 So your fries can be doused with gravy, cheese, oil or vinegar, but once it's ketchup it's not okay? Smh

7705 2018-12-21 21:58:28 Hey Premier Notley, Can you run for Prime Minister ? Apparently the one we have is somewhat, oil = $ =deaf, you would get my vote for sure.
7706 2018-12-21 21:58:20 The bananas act as a binder and give moisture to the bread, so you might have to add in an extra egg or oil along with the apples
7707 2018-12-21 21:58:02 I'm being told in the thread that it's common for a 25 year old to make $100k/year. You just have to work in the oil fields. I've spent the last 20 years saving peoples' lives, but I guess that's not as highly valued.
7708 2018-12-21 21:57:58 Tonight’s Dinner Feature

7709 2018-12-21 21:57:53 my mom said "someone in my quartet uses-" and then paused and the end of the sentence was "argan oil hairspray" and not, as my brain assumed, "they/them pronouns"
7710 2018-12-21 21:57:41 Jobs aside, we should be championing AB oil because we pull it out of the ground more cleanly & ethically than anyone else will
7711 2018-12-21 21:57:37 And what “interests” are you referring to? The expansion of greater Israel? The theft of oil?
7712 2018-12-21 21:57:28 Who got THC oil cartridges ?
7713 2018-12-21 21:57:07 To the curly girls ; please do a hot oil treatment if you never have. That shit feels SOOO good on your scalp and it leaves your curls soft asf and hydrated !

7719 2018-12-21 21:55:51 I don’t like oily food. Bul jol I buy is always too greasy for me and I end up with a pool of oil at the bottom. Once you cook the food to a soft enough state, you don’t need all the oil to lubricate your throat. But oil up as you wish, this is MY preference
7720 2018-12-21 21:55:39 Well, I was out having a life. The possibility of abiogenic oil is obviously being researched. Unlike you, I don't believe in squelching anti-consensus research.
7721 2018-12-21 21:55:23 Blimey...splendid news.
7722 2018-12-21 21:55:19 どちらも征圧低いのが難点
7723 2018-12-21 21:55:10 You could stop drying to dig every single last drop of oil or gas out the ground as well?
7724 2018-12-21 21:55:04 He disgusts me! I mostly love Oprah but I rue the day she introduced that snake oil salesman to the masses
7725 2018-12-21 21:55:03 おぱよーーー(*´ｪ`*)
7726 2018-12-21 21:55:02 So 5 minute oil change really 15 minutes and counting.....
7727 2018-12-21 21:55:00 syria, china, venezuela, saudia arabia, etc etc etc. they all either produce oil or are key to securing oil.

7730 2018-12-21 21:54:51 If Pep Guardiola and billions of oil money can’t stop Liverpool winning the league this year then football is well and truly dead.
7731 2018-12-21 21:54:50 Me:get me some chi oil please
Keith: ok send me a picture of the shea butter so i get the right thing. 
Me:  
Keith: tea tree oil?
Me:  
Keith: just send me a picture! 
Lmao
7732 2018-12-21 21:54:41 Refining won't help. There's excess capacity all over the continent and even if it was upgraded here, the product still needs pipelines. Government has no business telling producers what to do with their oil, this isn't Iran.
7733 2018-12-21 21:54:22 Hey gorgeous, sorry you’re feeling so terrible. I just got out of a lovely bath with your bath oil; helped my demanding week calm down loads. Thank you xxx
7734 2018-12-21 21:54:19 I thought the main reason for the struggles in the 70's was weak government and the oil crisis brought about by the carnage in the middle East and the oil cartels that sprung up around it.  Joe Gormley was the miners leader at the time of the 3 day week not Scargill.
7735 2018-12-21 21:54:14 Programming is fun at first. Burning the midnight oil, hacking stuff together.

As the years go on and one becomes weary of abusive management, nonsensical business requirements, and insane deadlines... Burn out sets in.

I've seen dev friends leave the dev industry over burnout
7736 2018-12-21 21:54:09 Crater filled with ice found on Mars!

7740 2018-12-21 21:53:26 Shit oil nobody wants
7741 2018-12-21 21:53:23 Favorite ways to cook unknown veggies: blanch it, stir fry/stove cook it with a bit of oil, salt and pepper. Add other veggies.
7742 2018-12-21 21:53:19 An open package of madeleines lying in an East Harlem gutter drain, getting soaked by the rain, while a rainbow-tinted river of oil & water flows around it into the sewer below, is some kind of neo-Proustian metaphor, but I don’t know for what. #amwriting #amwritingfantasy #NYC
7743 2018-12-21 21:52:56 how about getting off oil instead
7744 2018-12-21 21:52:45 Hopefully they'll break the record in poverty eradication and industrialization.  With the biggest oil derivative in Nigeria, Akwaibom state should wake up
7745 2018-12-21 21:52:44 I love this Tricia. There are so many things I wish I had time for: voice lessons, piano, oil painting, water colors. I’m going to pick 2. 
7746 2018-12-21 21:52:36 Nationalise, it is you Tory Arsehole’s who caused all this mess from electric, gas oil railways national grid power generation don’t blame the snp
7747 2018-12-21 21:52:35 Bull Sit.  And miss golf and big macs in a warm climate. Waste mass dollars on secret service protection for a country's first mentally challenged president when he could be taking advantage of low oil prices to operate Air Force One. Doesn't everyone want to work for free?
7748 2018-12-21 21:52:30 Vegan pesto??? What’s not vegan about pesto? I literally grow all the ingredients, except the olive oil.

7753 2018-12-21 21:52:09 OK. But u realize leaving now is a powerful reason not to rebuild former ISIS areas in Syria? Because ISIS is still there. And if we rebuild its former heartland then we are re-empowering it for its next attempt. Better wait till oil age is over and it can't regrow parasitically.

I don't want you on the phone hours each day begging corps for $ & for God's sake, don't brag about your corp fund raising! You have 200M$. You are the 4th? largest vineyard owner. Stop!
7758 2018-12-21 21:51:39 In 1974 the OPEC oil embargo crippled the US. In 1975 I took a course in solar energy as it was being touted as the future boom. That's when I learned how greedy & corrupt our government is. They have fought hard to keep us dependent on oil. We did know better but greed won.
7759 2018-12-21 21:51:35 came to get an oil change & the young guy that took my car saw two pairs of loose eyelashes & told me “always need some back ups huh”
7760 2018-12-21 21:51:33 Oil pricesgetting
7761 2018-12-21 21:51:28 There are plenty of 25-30 year olds making 100k . Linemen , different positions in the oil field
7762 2018-12-21 21:51:24 Hate taking my car to service, I go for a oil change leave with 5 other things wrong 
7763 2018-12-21 21:51:18 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
7764 2018-12-21 21:51:17 You know how sometimes you drive behind a car that is burning motor oil..and the burning oil fumes fill your car.

Last night I had that happen, but it was marijuana smoke instead of motor oil. I got a contact high from the car in front on me.

7767 2018-12-21 21:50:55 Yeah, if Erdogan kills off all the Kurds, Turkey can get in there and take the oil, Trump will get his kickback.  Anything is possible when psychopaths rule.

7769 2018-12-21 21:50:50 Russia has enough of its own oil & Syria will need it's own to finance reconstruction. Russia was asked by Syria's government for help & provided it unconditionally. Russia had been Syria's ally & armaments supplier for decades previously. Like US is Israel's friend & protector.
7770 2018-12-21 21:50:46 When his phone is almost dead
7771 2018-12-21 21:50:34 Oil being so toxic as it is can kill sea otters by damaging their lungs and eyes, creating severe liver and kidney failure. We have to keep our oceans clean and oil free!!
7772 2018-12-21 21:50:23 You know that’s probably a really great idea, but I’m pretty sure that new oil tankers are too large to fit through the Great Lakes locks. They would need to be rebuilt to accommodate the much larger ships. If there are oil tankers that fit through that’s an idea worth exploring.

7774 2018-12-21 21:49:55 What’s the best oil diffuser
7775 2018-12-21 21:49:48 Oil companies must have paid big bucks to get that pump house to the top of the pipeline. The fed us prime rib and salmon and put us up in a sweet condo plus paid us $220/day plus our USAF pay. Took 2 trips to get it up there.
7776 2018-12-21 21:49:35 Another reason sea otters fur is so precious to them is because without the fur keeping them warm they will die from getting hypothermia. One of the biggest threats to sea otters population are oil spills. The oil mats down their fur and makes it not protective for them anymore.
7777 2018-12-21 21:49:29 Bul jol is all raw (except for the saltfish) and tossed in oil. I use coconut. I however don’t like overly oily food so you won’t see oil dripping from this. Just my preference. The food is soft enough that it isn’t dry

7788 2018-12-21 21:48:32 Did you know, too, that there’s surprisingly little protein in a Big Mac?  Only 25 grams. It’s more like Big Bread and Big Sauce.

7791 2018-12-21 21:48:16 The irony is Mattis resigned because Trump did what NATO ally Turkey asked him to. The EU would probably let Erdogan join if he agrees to merge his army into the EU army so they can invade Syria together and divide up the oil between them.

7793 2018-12-21 21:48:09 Global warming is a far, FAR bigger problem globally than "material or airborne" pollution. Although it's worth worrying about production, operation, and disposal pollution (and again, common sense views 10 tons of dirty oil as worse than 2 tons of car), it's not a crisis.
7794 2018-12-21 21:48:02 You want open borders so that religions that you started wars for oil with can come move in next door. You care about oil, hence Russia. Your use of guilt as a weapon against Americans who want to preserve their communities is worse than a hundred nuclear attacks on the USA.

7804 2018-12-21 21:47:00 1- All the blame is on China but 70% of US Steel comes from Turkey. They won WTO suit against tariffs because there is already an agreement in place.Turkey bought 25b US weapons it will use to eradicate the Kurds and steal their oil Putin takes Syria’s oil & Ukraine ports.

7816 2018-12-21 21:45:06 Fighting the KXL pipeline IS a huge mistake.  That oil replaces Saudi & Venezuelan oil that isn't much different than Canadian heavy sour crude, and putting the oil on trains means more, not less, greenhouse gas emissions.  Fighting KXL is also fighting AFL-CIO union labor jobs.

7822 2018-12-21 21:44:01 That doesn’t work very well because the oil will oxidize and it isn’t cheap. Plus doing it in tanks limits the volumetric density, going with the server rack gives us a small enclosed and inert system where individual miners can be pulled easily.
7823 2018-12-21 21:43:54 Government loans are not the solution. Canadians rely on natural gas and products made from crude oil to meet more than two-thirds of their energy needs each and every day. We need greater market access, which means we need pipelines. #oilandgas #AlbertaStrong
7824 2018-12-21 21:43:52 He also received the 2nd highest amount of cash from big oil by collecting the maximum “individual amount”  from a ton of oil executives. An effort to keep it off the record.

7825 2018-12-21 21:43:46 Actually, it's the way palm oil is produced.  It's generally made by ripping large parts of the rainforest.

7828 2018-12-21 21:43:32 Not surprised Quebec is against Canadian Oil. Quebec for some reason always gets gouged at the pumps. Few months ago Ontario gas was about 1.22/ltr. Quebecers were getting screwed, paying 1.37/ltr. Quebec always gets robbed. What’s with that???
7829 2018-12-21 21:43:18 If the effing QCers would for once be less selfish, this country might have a chance. After 150 years of confederation, they still haven’t gotten with the program. Don’t support foreign oil over domestic oil. Their cheese or milk is all that tasty or of quality anyway.

Cadbury still uses palm oil in their chocolate, and harvesting palm oil comes with life-and-death stakes for innocent wildlife and ecosystems. (1/2)
7837 2018-12-21 21:41:48 It's really up to what oils work best with your skin. Jojoba and sweet almond oil are popular in part bc they are so similar to sebum.

How much you use also has to do with what your skin likes/doesn't like. I put about a tablespoon of oils into a 16 oz container of lotion.

7869 2018-12-21 21:39:42 The government should issue Wall Bonds payable in 15, 20 and 25 years. That would pay for the wall now. Then we could squeeze Mexico for cheap oil to pay the dividends on the bonds.
7870 2018-12-21 21:39:42 I think the catch-phrase “dirty oil” comes from emotional opinionated people who have nothing more than a bias against the Cdn oil industry.

Also your views on nuclear power as an oil substitute?
7918 2018-12-21 21:33:14 Brakes are close to out, and there are two oil leaks in my engine :/
7919 2018-12-21 21:33:10 But we don't have any libs out where I live. When I'm starting my fires with used motor oil and cutting laws with my chainsaw the neighbors are usually out shooting guns and riding dirt bikes and stuff
7920 2018-12-21 21:33:06 This "commander" is full of banana oil. An "investment" in #Afghanistan? 17 years worth.... Like being in a marriage where your spouse beats the hell out of you for 15 of 17 years, yeah you have an investment you can't walk way from. @TeamCavuto
7921 2018-12-21 21:33:05 The oil wey de your nose too much.. Clean am you go understand my friend 
7922 2018-12-21 21:33:05 Ugh  oil change is NOT cheap! At times like this I wish new. How to do it, but I’m really about to get under this car? Fuck no that’s DEAD  you can try me again!
7923 2018-12-21 21:33:04 Soil .... Oil ..... Earth .... Clay ..... Carbon ..... All taxed but they didn't create it?
7924 2018-12-21 21:32:54 It is very unfortunate we have an archaic president who lives in his own mundane reality. OPEC placed Nigeria oil production at 1.6m bpd to avoid oversupply of oil in the int'l market, @MBuhari made his budget based on estimated oil production of 2.3m barrel per day. Dead budget!
7925 2018-12-21 21:32:49 No stream today guys. Just got an oil change and am off to get mom her meds. Have a great night and sorry for being late.
7926 2018-12-21 21:32:49 Never do what a place doing your oil change says. Always take it to an actual shop not some crappy quick lube.
7927 2018-12-21 21:32:41 The Saudis are absolute barbarians, dressed up in fine robes and gold. I cannot wait until the next President, who hopefully will get the USA fully involved in solar and electric, and then WE CAN DUMP THOSE BASTARDS AND THEIR OIL
7928 2018-12-21 21:32:40 Thanks Isobel - I spent 2 hours on an oil painting this afternoon ( unsuccessful ) then managed this little guy in 15 minutes ! - Enjoy the festivities 
7929 2018-12-21 21:32:27 おいるさん、おはよーございます！
　本日もヨロシクお願いします
7930 2018-12-21 21:32:18 Annoying in winter doing all the time, but in summer you only have to clean and relube about every 300 miles ish. I do as the manufacturers suggest and clean with paraffin and relube with thick gear oil.
7931 2018-12-21 21:32:11 Online! Nudity & oil show tonight!! Merry Xmas! 
7932 2018-12-21 21:32:10 I just got a notification about gourmet olive oil for sale on my Nextdoor app. Am I officially an adult now? #NextDoor
7933 2018-12-21 21:31:59 I wonder if the north pole has oil
7934 2018-12-21 21:31:41 | Jamie : exists 

Ollie : Merry Chrysler I bought you motor oil for your augmentations

7938 2018-12-21 21:31:26 burning used motor oil is more effective and far safer. It has the added benefit of driving the libs crazy
7939 2018-12-21 21:31:11 Short / long value style. No trading. Could have used your signal back in September on oil
7940 2018-12-21 21:31:08 I gather is more just with very new plastic.
In later missions this was solved by doing the off gassing in a lab before the mission.

Same when you get a new car, you will get the new car smell and an oil film on the windows for first few months.
7941 2018-12-21 21:31:07 Getting my oil changed here at wood house and I'm bout to fall asleep.... #CRIPES
7942 2018-12-21 21:31:00 i should start using castor oil again. this time im gonna start putting them on my lashes because uHhH idk

7945 2018-12-21 21:30:51 So how long are we all going to ignore that Hayward/Brown are like oil & water & will not succeed on the same team together?
7946 2018-12-21 21:30:18 Cannabis oil doubtfully "cures cancer", but it can help with chemo side-effects.
7947 2018-12-21 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
7948 2018-12-21 21:30:14 This is the Christmas where every grandparent wants to talk about CBD oil
7949 2018-12-21 21:30:12 For the week (yuk!): The Dow was down 6.9%; the S&P off 7.0%; and the Nasdaq, down 8.4%. Worst for the week? The Philly Oil Service index, down 13.13%.
7950 2018-12-21 21:30:11 If you need to keep it kosher,  use olive oil. You can use cold broth.... from the store us fine... if you don't want to use milk or cream. 

Keep the temp medium low and stir it with a whisk as it cooks.
7951 2018-12-21 21:30:07 I can’t help you if you love the snake oil, just don’t blame me for it’s after effects. I’ll just say I told you so. You got taken by a grifter, it’s going to suck when you realize that.
7952 2018-12-21 21:30:03 Oil sand girls are hot, sexy and beautiful. 

Liberal girls are cold, disgusting, and ugly. 

That is a fact! 
7953 2018-12-21 21:29:40 Couple of issues I see: def not enough butter and you need to cream the butter (beat room temp butter on medium for 1-2 mins) before adding in the oil, sugars. I wouldn’t add any more egg. Try creaming some butter and adding that? It’s hard to salvage batter—steps are key.
7954 2018-12-21 21:29:37 Think I finally struck oil with my Vixens of Venmo IG account idea
7955 2018-12-21 21:29:34 Brezhnev: undoes all the reforms, nearly bankrupts the soviet state, institutionalizes corruption, over stretches the Soviet military, massively ramps up oil production & uses it to control client states, ecocides central asia
7956 2018-12-21 21:29:34 Ion call this shining, I call this oil sheenin
7957 2018-12-21 21:29:28 If the Kashoggi Op had worked OPEC would have defied Trump and raised oil over $100/ brl. 

Fed and Oil must councide to get the crash BIS requires to blame Trump and install Central Crypto. 

Central Bank block chain has Israeli written backdoors = Massive Debt Slavery.
7958 2018-12-21 21:29:27 I cut off all my hair AND I got a new oil today. Life is GOOD
7959 2018-12-21 21:29:27 KICK ASS. ALL OF TRUMPS IDEAS ARE STUPID IDEAS. TRUMP RUNS EVERYTHING LIKE A BUSINESS WHICH IT IS NOT. I BELIEVE IN GLOBAL WARMING AND IT NEEDS TO BE STOPPED. DRILLING FOR OIL NEEDS TO STOP. WE NEED TOUGHER GUN LAWS.
7960 2018-12-21 21:29:23 Let me guess, Israel paid her to throw a fit, because they still need the U.S. to further destabalize the region and not actually fight ISIS, but rather use ISIS as a deterrent for the Syrian Army so they can steal the Syrian oil. It's always the same narrative.
7961 2018-12-21 21:29:10 Just in time for the oil money
7962 2018-12-21 21:29:09 I’d recommend finding an spf for your face that works for you so the scars don’t darken. Rose hip oil is pretty popular. Vitamin c serums are good for some people. With that you have to use an spf because it makes your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Niacinimide serum is nice.
7963 2018-12-21 21:29:06 #ChristmasAnd__GoTogetherLike
Christmas and motor oil go together like similes.
7964 2018-12-21 21:28:46 I've been asking my dad since the being off November to point air in my tires. Well nearly two months later the Ford guys did it when I got my oil changed
7965 2018-12-21 21:28:45 a good oil treatment and deep condition  >>>>>
7966 2018-12-21 21:28:39 Oil is fallen down an and it will pull down other prices, groceries as well.
7967 2018-12-21 21:28:39 Quit babying these farmers.. almost as bad as the oil subsidies
7968 2018-12-21 21:28:37 What is near may seem so familiar that we take it for granted. Often, we know only what an oil company or local government pays for.
7969 2018-12-21 21:28:14 Our show has a cheque coming for you.
7970 2018-12-21 21:28:14 Still feeling constipation to me maybe we need some castor oil to get things moving!
7971 2018-12-21 21:28:10 I LOVE sprouts roasted with olive oil, black pepper, garlic powder and salt 
7972 2018-12-21 21:28:08 Kevin didn't hide his dumbness. Brett hid his under a veil of being the nice guy, when he was not. As part of the 1%, I guess you can't blame Brett trying to protect his oil investments.
7973 2018-12-21 21:27:39 Used for skid marks and oil spills.
7974 2018-12-21 21:27:34 Naaaa cause I had a bad experience with cooking oil. I walked past it and the shit popped in my eye
7975 2018-12-21 21:27:32 I use a jamaican castor oil w/ flax seed gel & a curly hair pudding I just bought from Walmart with a pro growth hit oil
7976 2018-12-21 21:27:17 I wonder what these people would do if the big oil companies bought up the Big Green energy companies there's a conundrum
7977 2018-12-21 21:27:07 #probillcosby facist,racist oil co had russian kill dr cosby son,lynch him,seperate him fr family to murder him in prison,then hound Camille out of the land,wealth,the strong cosbys will survive#kgnjam
7978 2018-12-21 21:27:07 That “Mobile Oil” Aden it througha few battles
7979 2018-12-21 21:27:01 Salt water gargles and honey. My esthetician also recommends putting eucalyptus oil under the pads of your toes and on your chest to help w congestion before bed
7980 2018-12-21 21:26:57 Seeing ‘no palm oil’ on the packaging of meat products makes me laugh, the hypocrisy is just &1&2&&118911!!2!22&&
7981 2018-12-21 21:26:49 But yet it's still the highest it's ever been in history. It's a correction, combined with the fed rate increase and oversupply of oil by Russia and Middle East.
7982 2018-12-21 21:26:48 Hannukah is Jewish, and about lighting candles in a menorah, one each night for each day where the fire kept going while under a siege in their history/book. There's also dreidels, and oil and dairy based foods?
7983 2018-12-21 21:26:40 If I had to pick 
Jets
Habs
Leafs
Oil
Flames
Ott
Van...
Unless van does back to the 90's bure jersey... then they jump to #2
7984 2018-12-21 21:26:36 Last year's expectation was 7.1trn while this year's projection is 6.96trn..our GDP unexpectedly grew by 1.81% in Q3 from 1.5 in Q2 largely fuelled by non oil sector..My prognosis is that it cannot get worse than Q2 particularly after general elections..
7985 2018-12-21 21:26:31 Maybe it's time the euro weenies and oil dictators to step up ! Enough of our treasure and children's blood on these dysfunctional tribes . Let them go at it as they have been for centuries
7986 2018-12-21 21:26:30 Bizarrely, Gaetz co-sponsored a bill to amend the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to penalize any foreign offshore oil refineries for “spills or other damages. Because he is an “environmentalist”, who, like, totally cares for the planet, dude. Probably. Kinda.
7987 2018-12-21 21:26:24 Cuz I’m loyal to my soil, good to my hood like oil.
7988 2018-12-21 21:26:13 Whale Oil Beef Oct!!    Who would’ve guessed!!
7989 2018-12-21 21:26:10 1. ISIS got beaten up very bad.
2. US arms won't slip into ISIS hands like it happened during Obama's time.
3. ISIS no longer has money to pay their militias (no oil sale revenue).

These are decent reasons for Trump to pull out, except Kurd's future. #MAGA
7990 2018-12-21 21:25:57 I hate taking trash out, pumping gas, getting oil changes, all that stupid shit 
7991 2018-12-21 21:25:48 The stock selling that began in early October kicked into high gear this week driving the market to one of its worst weeks in recent history.

Dow -7%

7993 2018-12-21 21:25:29 Spray em with Nubuck/Suede protector and let it dry.  Protects against mud, oil, beer the lot!

You can put em in a pillow case, cool wash, on the radiator to dry out and spray again when dry.  Tried and tested method for the last 35yrs, I swear by it.
7994 2018-12-21 21:25:26 Oil change, car wash and filled my tires???? I'm adulting 
7995 2018-12-21 21:24:51 When i see those provocative photo,the thing that come in my mind is that you love and encourage division....YOU dont want to fix the problem, you just want to put oil on the fire so it come bigger......The ONLY thing i see in that photo is 2 stupid human and pathetic editor....
7996 2018-12-21 21:24:49 ULTA LIP OIL IS THAT WORK!!!!!!
7997 2018-12-21 21:24:34 Honest, don't have a lot of hate in me. I hate the Arse because they are a franchise club with franchise fanbase who are puffed-up and they chose to build their business (not club) next to mine. Don't like Chels because oil money and preciousness of fans. everyone else irrelevant
7998 2018-12-21 21:24:26 I am grateful to have the opportunity to do many stories that matter to people. Tonight, CBD oil is my topic at both 5 and the full story at 10.
7999 2018-12-21 21:24:23 Why does everyone in Hawaii have to have a Tacoma it’s so hard to find good oil filters
8000 2018-12-21 21:24:23 She smirked and took a big sniff

“Ah, I love the smell of oil and lube in the morning!”
8001 2018-12-21 21:23:57 Yeah oil has nothing to do with it
8002 2018-12-21 21:23:47 Filled my tank, got an oil change, hit the gym, feeling like a brand new girl 
8003 2018-12-21 21:23:42 Use beard oil to grow your beard, use beard balm to balance everything out, and do squats to increase your testosterone.
8004 2018-12-21 21:23:39 Mr President  3 things that you should do in 2019: 1-Stop buying oil from the communist country of Venezuela, 2- prohibit the sharia law in USA, 3- build the dam WALL
8005 2018-12-21 21:23:37 if you believe that I have a dried up oil field to sell you
8006 2018-12-21 21:23:33 That short position on crude oil futures seems to be paying off. 
The Catholic in me always feels guilt pangs whenever a short position pays off ... but the Wolf in me tends to balance those feelings out.
8007 2018-12-21 21:23:30 I'd respectfully submit that extension+amendments of LCFS deserve at least honorable mention status. Commit to significant decarbonization of transportation through the only mechanism strong enough that the oil industry truly fears it. New support for ZEV infrastructure, CCS, etc
8008 2018-12-21 21:23:24 Be his beard oil 
8009 2018-12-21 21:23:12 I mean you splashed some oil on this fire tbh. At least you can see this is now a mainstream ideology now 
8010 2018-12-21 21:23:08 Roasted broccoli is amazing fwiw, great flavor even with a small amount of oil.
8011 2018-12-21 21:22:59 spain is challenging what i know about all food. i had:
- octopus + potatoes
- chocolate ice cream + salt + olive oil + bread
- calamari sandwich
and they were ALL DELICIOUS WTF WBXJQKLZ
8012 2018-12-21 21:22:57 thank you soooo much car oil:( u forgot to mention im funny:(
8013 2018-12-21 21:22:45 And probably now goes by Joanne
8014 2018-12-21 21:22:42 شكرًا جزيلا علي ذوق معاليك
8015 2018-12-21 21:22:36 Irresponsible bi-product of the oil industry plastics that never leave the planet but shrink into microscopic form until they end in food chain of all organisms. Microplastics are a result of single-use plastics like bags and water bottles.
8016 2018-12-21 21:22:27 The only commuter I saw this morning was big guy cycling a supermarket special fitted with a oil free fully rusted chain that was cross chained from the small end of a triple chainset to the opposite end of the cluster.
8017 2018-12-21 21:22:23 Because America controls the oil business in Syria and everyone pays them in dollars. I don't understand it all, but it's a façade to cover up their influence and remain in control of it rather than China, Russia, or the EU.
8018 2018-12-21 21:22:22 Do you happen to have any eucalyptus oil or Vicks? I put it in the tub and run a hot, hot, hot shower so it steams up. I hope you feel better soon!
8019 2018-12-21 21:22:10 Wall funding is not major border security priority. Border security is, not a wall. Total cost $24B to $40B and rising. Cost to maintain for years to come? Complicit snake oil sales.
8020 2018-12-21 21:21:55 Vitamin e oil, tea tree oil, lemon oil and frankincense oil
8021 2018-12-21 21:21:46 Perhaps inflation caused by increase in wages not cost push inflation, what is more important is that the non oil sector, particularly agriculture is witnessing a steady growth, revenue expectation decreased only by less than 200bn, that's marginal..
8022 2018-12-21 21:21:38 It's one of the most important oil shipping corridors in the world. Who's going to protect it from Russian aggression?
8023 2018-12-21 21:21:34 @TheLastLeg This drone bullshit is about Government creating legislation to stop the public monitoring them and the authorities taking away our human rights and stop corporations like Oil & Gas companies destroying the environment. 
But you won't dare say that live. Will you
8024 2018-12-21 21:21:25 This and CBD oil are the only reasons I can walk straight with my Degenerative Disc Disease.
8025 2018-12-21 21:21:19 No it can not if you  think about if we have a big storm and hail it will smash all the panels and wind  turbines.we need to fine out what runs the wind turbines  it is a lot of oil and power
8026 2018-12-21 21:21:14 This group is just talking about oil - pretty clear what went on and happened - wouldn’t call it Trump hating - the day I meet a perfect politician I will give it all away - why I loathe Partisan politics
8027 2018-12-21 21:21:14 yes..I have seen organic turmeric root in whole foods, trader joes, many local stores, indian stores. Coconut oil (cold pressed, unrefined, virgin) costco, amazon
8028 2018-12-21 21:21:11 I have atleast gotten my 17yr old to know where to check the oil, and how to add it... but he hasn't figured it out to check it regularly..before the light comes on. My 19yr old daughter has learned to check it atleast before she makes long trips back and forth to school (5hrs)
8029 2018-12-21 21:20:54 hey should i do a coconut oil hair mask on dry or wet hair?
8030 2018-12-21 21:20:45 An oil change and my tires balanced what what
8031 2018-12-21 21:20:44 If we want to help the people of Benezuela, STOP BUYING OIL FROM THAT COUNTRY..
8032 2018-12-21 21:20:44 I ran out of tea tree oil 
8033 2018-12-21 21:20:39 rosehip seed oil helps with redness and texturization of scars!! it saved my life lol
8034 2018-12-21 21:20:38 Ué... vendo Twitter nos últimos dias achei que oil e minério tinham sido substituídos por energia solar e nióbio 
8035 2018-12-21 21:20:33 おやあり～( ˙ᵕ˙    )
8036 2018-12-21 21:20:30 Putin will put in OIL pipe line in tomorrow....45 paid his boss(Putin)off  with this one act!
8037 2018-12-21 21:20:22 Make a roux of = parts flour and butter or olive oil.

Cook about 2 minutes for a light gravy, lower temp and longer to get it to brown a bit for darker meat. 

Add your COLD liquid... ALWAYS  Never add hot or warm liquid to hot roux. Season

Cook low and slow. DM me if you need.
8038 2018-12-21 21:20:22 That was then with $120 oil. This is now with $60 oil. The foreseeable future belongs to the oil importers. You will quote some numbers from John Redwood next.
8039 2018-12-21 21:20:20 Now Americans are privately funding ladders to go over the wall. Next we will privately fund boiling oil to go down the ladders.
8040 2018-12-21 21:20:18 Dip em in olive oil n slip em in some cotton gloves for the night! Juss dont eat em :))
8041 2018-12-21 21:20:12 Home made bread, Sardinia made olive oil
8042 2018-12-21 21:20:11 Yes, the 25 year old who makes 100k and has $825/rent and can make $615 in monthly charitable contributions... 

They absolutely live in like, the furthest reaches of Montana and live on an oil field they own I'm guessing 
8043 2018-12-21 21:20:07 Turkey gonna take Syrian oil fields if Assad doesn't work w SDF & move assets quickly

8046 2018-12-21 21:19:45 Someone told me years back the reason oil/gas prices dropped so low was the global banks were trying to prevent putin from circumventing them (when he tried using oil as currency).
8047 2018-12-21 21:19:44 We took an oil diffuser and it kept getting stolen lol didn’t think it was going to be that big of a hit
8048 2018-12-21 21:19:42 Bear markets expose overvaluation. Canadian & shale have been slaughtered while international micro-cap E&P's w exposure to Brent have held up much better. Demand is still strong globally but as you know FADE can control price on any strategic commodity. Oil is the new ZIRP.
8049 2018-12-21 21:19:26 Brett is a climate denier himself, as he protects his oil investments. He is not going to criticize one of his own.
8050 2018-12-21 21:19:20 Anyone use CBD oil vapes?? What does it do lol
8051 2018-12-21 21:19:20 I keep a jug of used motor oil handy to start bonfires with outside
8052 2018-12-21 21:19:16 had 45.50 area but it breached. Next level would be 44.60 area. Not in oil right now nor even trading. Just had a bid below on ES but got stopped entry so I did some $SPY calls for next week lottos and will let them go. Throw away $$$
8053 2018-12-21 21:19:16 @KathyCastorFL opposed barring those who have received money from big oil and fossil fuel co.panies from partaking in the committee for a Green New Deal bc it "violates free speech." 

fuck you. that's my free speech. stop supporting corporations over the whole goddamn planet.

8055 2018-12-21 21:18:55 Shoot ya Joe!!! there's billions of barrels of oil left in the middle east and pipelines to build in Aleppo and the Ukraine!
8056 2018-12-21 21:18:49 Yikes! I never recommend using gasoline to start fires. Used motor oil is fine though
8057 2018-12-21 21:18:49 Or I recognized the machine was rusty so I looked for my own oil. You can continue with the Twitter fingers or you can do what you can to not get caught in the machine. Dealer's choice.

8061 2018-12-21 21:18:17 They think this all because of oil burning. I say this bullshit. What we are going through is our destiny on Gods promise of his rath on our sins And you have not seen nothing yet just wait it coming yet to come worse.
8062 2018-12-21 21:18:10 So who wants to talk about how @circlekireland @CircleKStores is turning into the modern day Ohio Standard Oil monopoly?
8063 2018-12-21 21:18:08 Clean out the dust, add some light oil.  Or just do what I'm doing. Get your wife a rock for Christmas.
8064 2018-12-21 21:18:00 It's almost like the bumper-sticker "Please lord give me another oil boom. I promise not to piss it all away this time!" wasn't intended to be a user manual for the province of Alberta.
8065 2018-12-21 21:17:55 oregano oil helps EVERYTHING
8066 2018-12-21 21:17:47 My beard oil smells like holy water. I’m bout to grow a beard like Jesus
8067 2018-12-21 21:17:41 What about oil ThePivotKing? Also gap up and go?
8068 2018-12-21 21:17:40 Another lump of coal. Nothing jolly about the Dow being down 414; the S&P, 51; and the Nasdaq, 195. And there is no sense that this is over. The inside was 1 to 3.5 and 1 to 6.4. The 10-year went out at 2.8%, crude oil, $45.38 and the VIX about 30.
8069 2018-12-21 21:17:40 @USRepKCastor so now you just say things with out knowing if they are correct. ie, barring members who take funds from big oil. A page frim the trump book. Know your facts before you talk. #nooildollars
8070 2018-12-21 21:17:30 If you knew in 2011 that oil would be down 60%, and you believed that $CDN was correlated, you would have shorted $CDN and made good money.
8071 2018-12-21 21:17:23 I think automation will help change their minds for them, but I think it's also about explaining to them that UBI belongs to them just as much as Alaskan's oil dividends belong to Alaskans. It's not free money. It's freedom and it's rightfully theirs as the investors in tech R&D.
8072 2018-12-21 21:17:22 Except the US troops weren't there to protect the Kurds. They were there to stop Assad constructing a pipeline from Russia to Europe. Can't allow rapacious big oil and warrior corporations to be out of pocket.
8073 2018-12-21 21:17:22 The oil cartridge I got from LA be bussin !!! Like 3 pulls and I’m feeling dumb

8076 2018-12-21 21:17:18 Chef Gusteau cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was chicken, along with Silly Putty.
8077 2018-12-21 21:17:16 So why arn't we selling them our oil? Because we are not offering to ship it to them. Germany is also going through hard times with far right trying to take over.  We could do a boycot on their oil, rather use it as a threat against Putin
8078 2018-12-21 21:17:13 Now this is a worthwhile cause. Hi Corbyn. However the truth is really sorry. That the UK govt will do nothing to jeopardize the military contracts. The Saudi can kill and no one will do anything. Oil is worth more than blood.
8079 2018-12-21 21:17:07 Not at $45 oil...
8080 2018-12-21 21:17:05 castor oil has done me good ladies
8081 2018-12-21 21:16:58 I hate getting oil changes because like I never know what they telling me I need. All I see is $200 this and $149 that. To which imma always say NO
8082 2018-12-21 21:16:51 Between equalization and the cut to oil  prices due to federal decisions, alberta is over-taxed. 

And yes, i count the federally caused pipeline capacity squeeze to be a “tax”.
8083 2018-12-21 21:16:47 • Wasteful self-indulgence: tax-paid ads, external consultants, overloaded cabinet, excessive Min. offices, an empire at the PMO;
• Muzzling of scientists;
• Selling substantial oil sands assets to Chinese state owned CNOOC...

Seriously. I’m no fan of JT, but let’s be real.

8086 2018-12-21 21:16:40 Not that she's nearly the only one doing this, but it's too bad she's undermining the message of her own journey by selling snake oil products and other BS.
8087 2018-12-21 21:16:36 Last is it could be possible that all this Mattis leaving and oil falling was a divergence between them as we were firmly in the diplomatic lane and now could be moving to oil as a diplomatic tool. Risky business.
8088 2018-12-21 21:16:32 Ok I just got olive oil as a office Christmas present...
8089 2018-12-21 21:16:13 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
8090 2018-12-21 21:16:11 I need to take my car to Honda to get a oil change
8091 2018-12-21 21:16:06 It is the best tasting flavored CBD oil I have ever tried!  Delicious!
8092 2018-12-21 21:16:04 Getting my oil changed 
8093 2018-12-21 21:15:56 In my earlier dirt bike riding days, if I went with my buddy to their cabin, we’d always enjoy making a giant bonfire. Bigger the better. Using old engine oil and a LITTLE gasoline got her chooching REALLY quick!

8101 2018-12-21 21:15:39 Oil painting is honestly perfect bc I can get distracted in the middle of a painting, come back to it like hours later, and the paint is still wet as if nothing happened
8102 2018-12-21 21:15:33 I can't wait to have my own apartment so I'd have my own kitchen, which means I'd have space for things in my fridge and freezer like frozen coffee cubes, frozen oil cubes, multiple forms of milk and cheese, and homemade preserves and dressings. So sick of sharing space.
8103 2018-12-21 21:15:25 Dude, she thinks oil backed politicans should be able to lead on climate change. Heck, looking at her donors she’s bought and paid for too. Read the #IPCC report, time is almost up to meaningful stave off the worst effects of climate change. Her district will be underwater soon.
8104 2018-12-21 21:15:25 KFC staff and everybody that eats those wings with oil
8105 2018-12-21 21:15:05 I'm just challenging your wars for oil theory. It's military history...no one wants wars...but they happen. And despite what critics may say...the U.S. has a very disciplined and capable military.

Look at Venezuela...sooner or later we'll be there too...who else can help them?
8106 2018-12-21 21:15:00 October GDP release mechanically boosts the #ScotiabankEconomics Model Nowcast for Q4-2018 up 50 basis points to 2.07% – but ongoing Alberta oil production cuts could still drag it down to a more modest 1.7% to 1.8% #CdnEcon
8107 2018-12-21 21:14:48 #cdnre through the roof last 8 years. Oil down 60%. $CDN/$USD down 30%.  In other words, if you knew for a fact in 2011 that CDN R/E was going to double by 2018, and $CDN would mirror CDN R/E, you would have went long $CDN... and lost your shirt. #vanre #vanrecrash
8108 2018-12-21 21:14:48 Went to get my oil changed and they told me that mice are living in my car and made themselves a little home by my battery. Awesome.
8109 2018-12-21 21:14:48 She doesn’t have any oil or gaz and it is nothing to envy to Russia but for political reasons it makes think.  Sure the so famous values of freedom, equality and fraternity are increasingly violated.
8110 2018-12-21 21:14:48 Somebody has to get all that sweet crude oil in the Golan Heights...  Or "Northern Israel" as the neocons would probably like to rename it.  Why share the wealth with sovereign citizens, when they can simply be displaced or eliminated through foreign meddling and regime change.
8111 2018-12-21 21:14:44 Essential oil diffuser would be AMAZING
8112 2018-12-21 21:14:24 You are just like them. Both don’t appreciate ethics. But it’s understandable the media in this country and ethics = water and oil
8113 2018-12-21 21:14:20 Absolutely agree! Dispensaries have their products tested so customers won’t have to find the information themselves. I think this conversation is more of finding CBD oil on many sites and not having their testing/information available. 
8114 2018-12-21 21:14:06 Green tea. Mint green tea is super good in the mornings. Also use tea tree oil & rose water (only at night because of smell). It’ll burn for a few minutes but you’ll wake up with MUCH clearer skin
8115 2018-12-21 21:14:02 US put the kurds in charge of the oil fields because the neo's want a Free Kurdistan state. It's been in the works for over 10 years. It's a handful of rich people mapping out how they want the world to look. Every action the US foreign policy is towards neocon/neoliberal goals.
8116 2018-12-21 21:13:53 Bi oil je crois que ça aide à faire partir les cicatrices
8117 2018-12-21 21:13:44 They never benefited from Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya anywhere. They will never benefit from Syria. Syria has no oil just in case you are mistaken, nearly negligible quantities. The US will only gain a bully's ego massage and many dead young men and women across the desert there
8118 2018-12-21 21:13:33 I have family and friends in Alberta I care about deeply. Watching a bunch of irrational, far righties blame Trudeau and the rest of Canada for oil prices and threaten to tear my country apart instead of making any bipartisan attempt at solutions is killing me #CdnPoli 1/2
8119 2018-12-21 21:13:06 With whomever you want as long as you are full of oil
8120 2018-12-21 21:13:04 I have upped my vitamin D and mineral intake, and my doctor recommended oil of oregano to amp up immunity. ESPECIALLY during the onset.

I should probably get lots of rest, too. Heh.

8131 2018-12-21 21:11:59 Do you have any idea how much money Alberta has sent Ottawa that has been divvied out to the have not provinces? Where do you think that money came from? The world demand for oil is increasing not decreasing.
8132 2018-12-21 21:11:56 They spent $580 Billion on renewables and are strip mining new areas for coal. Again, oil is a commodity. They could get it from us but chose Russia, probably because Schroeder is with GAZPROM. Why should i worry about Russia gaining power if Europe is not? I do not get that?
8133 2018-12-21 21:11:55 I'd take it further by saying ISIS was America's boots on the ground to undermine the safety,security and the growing prosperity in the region!Anyone that believes US could not curtail ISIS oil getting to market is blind!
8134 2018-12-21 21:11:47 He obliges to steal the Iraqi Oil lol

8139 2018-12-21 21:11:16 Supply management IS bad. Costs Cdns money. But dairy wants it. Oil industry doesn’t want it (mandated cuts are not best option).  Didn’t want govt to buy TMX.

8156 2018-12-21 21:09:32 I remember 2014-15 quite vividly. CNBCs finest would roll up their sleeves, loosen their tie and call #oil bottom at $85..$80...$75...$70...$65...$60 (oh, no getting close to breakeven)...$55...$50

8160 2018-12-21 21:08:50 I’m for pulling out but how do we have your oil fields? Far as I know you produce minimal oil compared to your neighbors and that was a common talking point of left wingers in the early 2000s

8164 2018-12-21 21:08:40 @TeamCavuto Oil levered and dropping margin calls abound that's what's causing selloff-thought U knew this stuff! #MAGA
8165 2018-12-21 21:08:30 I'd recommend actual oil over them, but they're really not much different.
8166 2018-12-21 21:08:27 1) Because the individuals affected by the ROW would scream & have the fullest amplification from a skeptical media
2) Because our politician class hates transit
3) Because we need to buy vaporware fighter jets and give oil companies huge tax breaks!
8167 2018-12-21 21:08:23 These bitches take toooooo long to do a oil change 
8168 2018-12-21 21:08:22 The man next to me at the airport bar is trying truffle oil for the first time and his reaction is amazing. “OMG they should put this on everything”.

8175 2018-12-21 21:07:48 @TeamCavuto explain Oil margin calls causing selloff!
8176 2018-12-21 21:07:47 Oil is a commodity. If Germany wanted our oil, we would have sold it to them but they have the last chancellor on the board at GAZPROM. You are not making any sense and blaming it all on the US who funds NATO and has the only real military in Europe-Germany funds Russia-now what?
8177 2018-12-21 21:07:47 Every lawmaker that comes along  wants to change a law  to please their group of voters. We have so many laws on the books that have become impertinent to our country today. Cartelneed to make their countries beautiful. Oil countries use & make towns beautiful
8178 2018-12-21 21:07:31 Best is vegetable oil. Olive is also good, a bit expensive though.
8179 2018-12-21 21:07:17 Sana oil
8180 2018-12-21 21:07:11 My dad let me borrow his truck for camping and when I came home he got my oil changed and my car detailed:,) #WhatASaint
8181 2018-12-21 21:07:07 Have you checked on oil spill on Okemah lake?
8182 2018-12-21 21:07:07 With time, dust, conditioner, oil, germs, even dust mites can collect in your hair brush! Clean your brush on a regular basis!
8183 2018-12-21 21:07:07 I shouldn't need to explain this to an adult. 

She used CBD oil that was not THC-free, the dog got high and was distressed. 
Animals should not be given psychotropic drugs as they can cause tremors & seizures.

I have no problem with people using it.
8184 2018-12-21 21:06:57 2019 Preview: Renewable energy race to ramp up as oil use skyrockets: As global demand for energy… @environmentguru
8185 2018-12-21 21:06:57 These oil tanker accidents explosions and accidents, is becoming worrying! Hope they ain't terror related. @azzy_TVCNews @tvcnewsng
8186 2018-12-21 21:06:56 Furthermore, “Children came to cheer on their parents, holding signs like: “I am a proud patch kid” and: “All dads in oil and gas kick a** because hugging a tree doesn’t feed me!” is an awful view to pass onto your kids. That tree keeps you alive. Wtf is wrong with these people ?
8187 2018-12-21 21:06:53 They also work as wearable oil diffusers #TheMoreYouKnow
8188 2018-12-21 21:06:53 The point is that there is no *technical* reason why we can't go to Chi by train in 6 hrs. It's a political question. So why are we willing to seize land & ram through highways, pipelines, and oil wells while we can't find a few bucks for a decent train?
8189 2018-12-21 21:06:43 I need to get a oil change like today .. smh
8190 2018-12-21 21:06:34 Things overheard while waiting on my oil change: “yea all these Brazilians come and drive on the wrong side of the road. This isn’t Brazil. Go back to your country”

Someone should let this bitch know that they drive on the same side of the road there.
8191 2018-12-21 21:06:34 Who is this 25 yr old? What does he do for a living? A person that young making money like that either lives in North Dakota (oil boom) or a large city. Unless this person is shacked up or has roommates, rent seems a little low for most cities. And $615 in donations? Get real.
8192 2018-12-21 21:06:32 @KNMAIndia I saw Sh.Nadarji walking slowly & analysis he might have back pain, if yes, I can try to cure that without any medicine, just some body message, few light yoga poses & almond oil, I am at sec 126, please call me, May God bless him good & healthy health 2 serve nation
8193 2018-12-21 21:06:30 And on the third day god made Bertuccis dipping oil
8194 2018-12-21 21:06:18 That's NOT "parroting". (As any 8th-grader could see).  Exxon claims a 1st A right to support any view that they want. Castor expressed reservations about barring people from the Committee that accepted oil industry donations.  Not even close.
8195 2018-12-21 21:06:17 Once I oil my feet I'm off no time to do more
8196 2018-12-21 21:06:08 IM 1,310 OVER AND NEED AN OIL CHANGE LOL
8197 2018-12-21 21:06:02 Due to government policy Alberta just received 1.6 billion. You let our oil get to new markets you have more jobs, more royalty payments etc.
8198 2018-12-21 21:05:47 After #SyriaWithdrawal by #Trump lead- #USA, #Turkey and #Russia must be more than happy to get a bigger share of #Syrian 's new found oil and gas fields. 
Make Them Great Again
#MAGA #fail #sad
8199 2018-12-21 21:05:44 We could eat orange only for Christmas, and it was limited to something like 1 kilogramm per person. Bread, sugar, oil, rice, flour, milk only limited amount per person per month. Never again. 
8200 2018-12-21 21:05:42 Good thing you didn't trust him on his oil to $30 call in the beginning of the year.
8201 2018-12-21 21:05:40 At this point, ditching coal for renewable energy is just statistically much more lucrative on every KPI. It all comes down to how much deep in bed govts are with the oil and coal lobbies.
8202 2018-12-21 21:05:32 I dont agree, we have went thier for decades, for one thing, OIL. 
Thats the simple truth, the West wants control of the middle easts oil. The West wants the ME oil and the West wants pipelines in Turkey and Ukraine. Just like Hitler in WW2
8203 2018-12-21 21:05:30 Females b driving fast AF blasting cardi B and ain't had a oil change in 6 months
8204 2018-12-21 21:05:30 That’s what oil money buys yes. How long have you supported City? 3/4 years?
8205 2018-12-21 21:05:08 Funny...the Marshall Plan did so much good to Europe. No oil there! Next!
8206 2018-12-21 21:04:57 got my oil changed yesterday and somehow got them to change both of the air filters for free instead of getting charged $90 and i’m very proud of myself for that one
8207 2018-12-21 21:04:55 And oil prices are going down so that hurts them on a different level.
8208 2018-12-21 21:04:36 Europe, Russia, China, India and everybody else in the world did not accept this unilateral sanction. Be realistic.  that was perhaps a  tactic by US to bring the price down. This administration is not pro oil. On this regard, it is similar to the Regan area. WTI is to $ 27.
8209 2018-12-21 21:04:26 Christmas and I go together like oil & vinegar #ChristmasAnd__GoTogetherLike
8210 2018-12-21 21:04:23 Almost none. Most oil we import comes from Canada and that has been going down. U.S. is basically energy independent.
8211 2018-12-21 21:04:17 What I like on the second pic is the number of oil field symbols.... very interesting
8212 2018-12-21 21:04:01 Females be driving fast af blasting Cardi b & ain’t had a oil change in 6 months 
8213 2018-12-21 21:04:00 Crude Oil.

Washed down with oil juice.

(The rest of the country hates that shit.....)
8214 2018-12-21 21:03:59 Looks like a fucking hotel room
8215 2018-12-21 21:03:58 So you can't vape cbd oil? I really don't know.  Serious question.
8216 2018-12-21 21:03:53 wow I can't imagine $20 oil!
8217 2018-12-21 21:03:50 No, I asked you first! You asserted that our armed involvement/conflicts are related to oil.

Is that why we fought in WWII? Oil?
8218 2018-12-21 21:03:47 Ahhaha oil i dustry worker, tabt explains everything. Omg ahahah.
8219 2018-12-21 21:03:45 "Who got the oil?"

Uhh... oil companies; the ppl who received Iraq's previously state-owned oil industry?
8220 2018-12-21 21:03:44 Ina sheda 
8221 2018-12-21 21:03:42 Another way to stop Western Canadian economy. Shut down the railway.Stop exports of oil,grain,potash,lumber and the movement of goods into the prairies. Merry Christmas from Team Trudeau!
8222 2018-12-21 21:03:28 I just got an oil change and the mechanic just asked me out on a date. Instead of just saying no, I tried to leave really quickly and ran into the door. My life is great I promise
8223 2018-12-21 21:03:17 I agree. No money for you But we will protect our coastlines so if you don’t start talking to us...you can drown in your damn oil
8224 2018-12-21 21:03:13 GOT BALLS crash da stock market & KILL big OIL..... build da cain (magnetic engine) ..... in my twitter feed !!!!!
8225 2018-12-21 21:03:08 Asia trip in response to a reporters question re Putin in Syria Trump replied “we just want him/them to leave”. 

I said at that point we’ve gone about as far as we can with diplomacy and now oil is up to bat.   

I thought we’d with allies drive oil down to 10-20 before Russia
8226 2018-12-21 21:03:00 They need oil and Gas, where are we in supplying Germany with that? If we do not step up then Putin will fill that void
8227 2018-12-21 21:03:00 There are some of us on restricted diets for health reasons. I certainly can't eat bread, rice, pasta, turnips, margarine, vegetable oil, potatoes, sweet potatoes, sweetcorn, for example.
8228 2018-12-21 21:02:59 We don't need the oil or the headache. Declare victory and say "Bye"......
8229 2018-12-21 21:02:56 I honestly think it's about pipelines. People are figuring out that we are losing $80 million + a day bc we can't get our oil to tide water. It highlights the incompetence of the Trudeau Liberals. Surprised by those BC numbers.  Didn't think the PC's had that much support there.
8230 2018-12-21 21:02:50 The US has never bought most of the ME oil. It's about keeping the system open, not maximizing transactional leverage over one resource. Not China wld keep the system open.
8231 2018-12-21 21:02:46 If this was an oil painting it would look out of place in the 18c gallery of the national
8232 2018-12-21 21:02:25 @MSNBC  Hope this teaches Lindsey Graham a lesson; i.e., that is to never buy snake oil from a snake oil salesman.
8233 2018-12-21 21:02:24 Bio oil
8234 2018-12-21 21:02:21 Hi welcome to Hobbs New Mexico the home of syphilis and oil, red or green?
8235 2018-12-21 21:02:18 Went to Jiffy lube and they said $45. Drained my oil then said $100... Awesome
8236 2018-12-21 21:02:17 The point of the article is that if Trudeau wants to avoid populist parties becoming more powerful, and him particularly losing power, then he needs to make sure the oil patch is healthy. If you read the article and not just the headline, then does that mean you disagree?
8237 2018-12-21 21:02:11 Maybe.  My guess is that, as in Syria, Mr. Putin may have the last word here.  "We'll sell all Russian gas & oil to EU in EUR" would have important implications in the outcome of this discussion.  My guess US wouldn't dislike Nordstream 2 so much if this wasn't being discussed.
8238 2018-12-21 21:02:08 YW! Aren't you glad? This oil drilling will be stopped one way or another..
8239 2018-12-21 21:02:00 My brother has MS, and takes CBD oil for his legs when he feels like can't drive, (you can't do that w/ pain meds).
I take CBD oil when I have arthritis in my hand while playing guitar.
I would rather not trade being addicted to meds for my playing.
Miracle non- drug medication.
8240 2018-12-21 21:01:50 This assumes I have oil or know where to put it!
8241 2018-12-21 21:01:50 yes!! i’ve just been calculating expenses through printing or buying a printer and also future projects such as oil painting which is my DREAM medium  so far i’ve been using my handy pencil and paper lol
8242 2018-12-21 21:01:49 Use turmeric and CBD oil thatGod created. Works wonders.
8243 2018-12-21 21:01:33 Allah yasa albarka

8246 2018-12-21 21:01:01 $SPX is finally following $OIL again.
8247 2018-12-21 21:00:59 Probably smells like leather and gun oil.
8248 2018-12-21 21:00:56 We are the largest oil exporter - busted myth...next!
8249 2018-12-21 21:00:50 i leave for Lucas Oil Stadium tomorrow and finally get to see the Peyton Manning statue in person...i’m probably going to cry
8250 2018-12-21 21:00:48 I don't unfortunately. I only know where to get great CBD oil. Maybe have her try the 2500mg CBD oil from Pharmaxtracts. It always helped me sleep, but I'm down to 1000mg now
8251 2018-12-21 21:00:44 woke up @ 5am, found Morning Joe on YT. within 20 minutes:
"gift to Putin" 
"wrong time to exit" (is there EVER a good time?) 
&
"this could trigger another 9/11".

get ready for more WMD type bullshit. their job is ratings and sponsors (military/big oil)not information. #Syria
8252 2018-12-21 21:00:39 Nat leader who wants to be PM didnt know that 2 of his Ministries were doing this - lying or incompetent... oversaw issue of 20k dodgy WOFs causing 1 death, signed DOC park to oil exploration, used 15 abused women to save his own skin... but docs clearly ILG = farce @TovaOBrien
8253 2018-12-21 21:00:34 So, how much of our imported oil is from that region, at present?
8254 2018-12-21 21:00:30 As your so smart maybe you can tell me why Russian's are so poor yet live in the country with the biggest oil & gas producer on earth & Just raise pension age past the average life expectancy of 63 to 65 ? For men #Russia #Putin ??? & #usefullidiot
8255 2018-12-21 21:00:24 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
8256 2018-12-21 21:00:15 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.
8257 2018-12-21 21:00:14 How many more people should we kill in the middle east to prove to Putin we are the toughest kid on the block? Few thousand? 100's of thousands? Be honest, is your family in the oil business in Syria? Iran? Libya? Iraq? Kuwait? Pipelines in Turkey?  The Ukraine?
8258 2018-12-21 21:00:11 And the Pennsauken Mart, where they sold “pimp oil.” I miss that jawn too.
8259 2018-12-21 21:00:10 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy
8260 2018-12-21 21:00:05 Hey add Puerto Rico to the list. 125 years of colonialism under the U.S. ...what was the motivation there? There's oil, gold...just a bunch of **Spanish Speaking aliens **according to the 1900 Supreme Court.

What did the U.S. gained there?

I'm challenging your theory.
8261 2018-12-21 20:59:57 Dude, this bi southern male would take said pliers, and smack the gift giver on the head with the damn things.  I make money so I can pay assholes to do the shit that bores me.  I don't do repairs, I don't change oil, and I don't tinker with shit.  I stay good looking and clean.
8262 2018-12-21 20:59:56 Spot on sir! The only thing that made us relevant was oil! And these days Oil is no longer a hot commodity, everybody has oil, we literally have nothing to offer the world that will make dem care about us
8263 2018-12-21 20:59:55 Well I announced and tweet about it.
8264 2018-12-21 20:59:48 Of course.... it has nothing to do with oil in the South China Sea????
8265 2018-12-21 20:59:29 House cleaner? What am I an oil baron?
8266 2018-12-21 20:59:22 I got the oil change covered!
8267 2018-12-21 20:59:18 Gaetz argues each state should handle own environmental regulations.  This move has diddly-squat to do with campaign contributions from “family friends” Harness Oil & Ga, Inc, Smith Energy, Gulf Power, NextEra Energy, Southern Company, or Koch Industries.  The man is a prince!
8268 2018-12-21 20:59:18 Question: a friend off mine just passed his driving test, very good, but they popped the engine and asked where oil and water is! ...... question what if u had a Tesila?  
is that part off test?? 
8269 2018-12-21 20:59:12 All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting marijuana and cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening your property.
8270 2018-12-21 20:59:10 Quebec's 1995 sovereignty referendum culminated after over 40 years of the Quiet Revolution, based on issues of preservation of Francophone culture, language, and political sovereignty-association

Alberta's sovereignty movement is based solely on low oil prices
8271 2018-12-21 20:59:09 No, I said more with real estate than oil.  Doesn't necessarily mean it's a direct correlation in merely pointing what people on trading desks tell me

8274 2018-12-21 20:58:52 I used to run from my mum when she used to put oil in my hair as a kid and now I run to her for it, the switch up is mad
8275 2018-12-21 20:58:51 John, this is a Very Old News. The sanction on Iran Oil was impractical, not well thought as most of the refineries using Iranian oil can not use lower qualities produced by others. US also shoot to their foot when introduced a sanction which was illegal to begin with.
8276 2018-12-21 20:58:48 And this all based on a 3 percent GDP growth 60+ oil prices no further corporate welfare and no additional taxes.  We are nowhere near that right now so the deficits will be higher still so maybe 2045?  @JustinTrudeau does not understand economics just drama!
8277 2018-12-21 20:58:48 Erdogan wants to exterminate Kurds, who are US allies against ISIS. Trump will leave Syria, abandoning Kurds in exchange for Erdogan not releasing more incriminating info on MBS/Khashoggi. Protects Jared/Trump from MBS blackmail & gives Putin control over crucial Middle East oil
8278 2018-12-21 20:58:47 This law is what I would call a common sense law.
Murder is murder.
Whether you shoot someone, stab someone, strangle someone, bury them alive, boil them in oil,
cut their throat, Lynch them, yeah that's Right.
Murder. Apparently, people had to be told that this was murder.

8279 2018-12-21 20:58:34 Kuwait please they had Iraq spend million and millions defending them and to thank them stole Iraq oil. CIA told Iraq USA wouldn’t get involved and then did and then Iraq wanted to negotiate and USA gave them the finger all as kuwait was stealing their oil
8280 2018-12-21 20:58:31 Aye man, anyone that uses beard oil has to have bitches man
8281 2018-12-21 20:58:30 Still sounds like a European problem. What ever happened to the left’s mantra no blood for oil? Blood ok for natural gas then?
8282 2018-12-21 20:58:29 The best person to rule Nigeria and make it great in my own opinion is Donald Duke. The man has clear vision and knows what to do to booster the economy not just through crude oil & agriculture but Tourism and many more. I wish Nigerians can be wise to see we need bright minds
8283 2018-12-21 20:58:27 We do nit have a boycot on his oil, also we did not try and to supply Germany with the oil they need, that is on us. The Olympics is a different issue all together that has nothing to do with any of it,, it is something to bring countries, enemies and allies alike together

8286 2018-12-21 20:58:12 @elonmusk has anyone tried to do a Input Carbon Tax? Simply tax only the points where extra carbon enters circulation: coal mines and oil wells at a fixed tax per ton of coal and per barrel and let free market resolve the rest of supply chain.

8289 2018-12-21 20:58:03 And yet ? Still the #1 country in the world. Now # 1 producer of oil, economy still in good shape, veterans are better off than they were, on and on. Everyone wants to be here. We need a wall!!!!
8290 2018-12-21 20:57:50 @GreggJarrett Mattis and McCain would have been very compatible; Strong American military presence, Nation Building. Do we forget that OIL always has been and is a major cause for our involvement in the Middle East; as it has since WW2.
8291 2018-12-21 20:57:45 Any comments on the #3rdWay corporate fascist appeasement arm of the #DNC working to gut it by loading the Committee with Oil Executives?

8292 2018-12-21 20:57:38 Coffee might have killed me but tea tree oil saved my life!
8293 2018-12-21 20:57:35 The FG @NGRSenate @SONNigeria has to work real hard to eradicate fake products that have flooded the Nigerian market. From fake motor spare parts, to products, drugs, electronics, etc. I bought super glue only to find oil inside the pack.

8294 2018-12-21 20:57:34 Try in Whole Foods if u have one for pasu manjal or any Indian grocery. Virgin Coconut oil (cold pressed & unrefined) can brought through Amazon, available in Walmart / Costco etc... hope, it helps
8295 2018-12-21 20:57:34 Hi Kate! I'm answering back from a car dealership. My shift ended at 1 pm. @ArizonaDOT will have all your  I-10 closure updates. Getting an oil change now and Car Wash. So expect rain soon.
8296 2018-12-21 20:57:30 not just for eyebrows but taking vitamin e or biotin is good for hair growth! i have also heard applying castor oil to your eyebrows will help them grow
8297 2018-12-21 20:57:01 panic! at the disco, twice! once somewhere in mid-indiana and again at the lucas oil stadium in Indianapolis
8298 2018-12-21 20:57:00 วันนี้กุเอฟอะไรไปบ้างนะ มีเคสโทสับ มีพาเลทตา มีพาเวอร์แบงค์ มีสายชาร สบายใจละ
8299 2018-12-21 20:56:48 when I spoke to some of the big oil dudes,
they were 100% behind the new cities of the future. 
they even offered soultions to some problems.
it must be the French/Vatican Spanish Inquisition
motherfuckers that have us stuck in reverse to 1888
with a love of mass schadenfreude.
8300 2018-12-21 20:56:47 Oh wow, so oil could be in the mix. Scary!
8301 2018-12-21 20:56:28 Yes, due to government rules one charged me hundreds of pounds for a few minutes work which was probably done by the office junior.
Snake oil salesmen if you ask me.
8302 2018-12-21 20:56:24 No doubt some unironic griping about Big Oil from supposed conservatives.
8303 2018-12-21 20:56:01 Please STOP USING PALM OIL.
8304 2018-12-21 20:55:57 Oil and gas, it's always about the money isn't it.
8305 2018-12-21 20:55:25 $50 barrel of oil...hurting rubles...19.5% Rosneft commission not so much either if based on price of shares....
8306 2018-12-21 20:55:24 Sorry for not being more articulate.

What I meant was, the big oil money lobbying against our political class to be against the shift to renewable and clean energy

As for costs, everything I’ve seen actually shows renewables as being less expensive than oil
8307 2018-12-21 20:55:24 It continues to blow my mind that Nugenix and similar "supplements" are able to advertise on TV. Would you like a little toxic masculinity to go along with your snake oil?
8308 2018-12-21 20:55:22 Hillary/Liar OBAMA FRAUD Established ISIS,Not IRAQ

OBAMA Permited ISIS Selling Oil&Ship
OBAMA Shielded ISIS & Did Not Fight ISIS

8309 2018-12-21 20:55:21 baby got her first oil change today 
8310 2018-12-21 20:55:18 I love the Garden 7-grain "fried chicken" pieces! I loathe tofu pups/smart dogs yeeech.

Tofurkey, I don't really like the slices but I love the roast. I just use a mix of olive oil and Montreal chicken rub, but you have to put moist root veggies around it for moisture.
8311 2018-12-21 20:55:08 Talk to me about 9/11...was that because of oil?

Enlighten me.
8312 2018-12-21 20:55:03 Calms toothaches and other dental pain — Given its analgesic properties, clove essential oil can be used to soothe toothaches. Simply place a few drops of clove oil on an organic cotton ball and place it next to the bothersome tooth.
8313 2018-12-21 20:55:01 Cooking oil. Which one. The normal is bad
8314 2018-12-21 20:54:52 when the GPS systems went online,
they found the petroleum motherloads
and began to use nukes to frack.
fast forward to today, 
we have more oil than they know what to do with.
it'd be at $15-$20 a barrel if there wasn't the 
$46 dollar a barrel loans time bomb baked in the cake
8315 2018-12-21 20:54:52 Bringing our troops home is progressive. We've been there way too long and I'm sure the Afghan people are brave enough to protect themselves by now.let's face it this wall was never about people it's about the oil. if I had to bet the oil fields are corporate controlled already.
8316 2018-12-21 20:54:34 If his votes are so awful, which they are, why invent lies about him taking money from oil execs?
8317 2018-12-21 20:54:19 Yes it terrible when your perpetual state of war gets interrupted. Now the CIA will have to plan a new terror attack to make themselves and this vast offensive army, relevant. And look at those oil prices, gasp. No this wont do. Its 2001 all over again. Sigh...
8318 2018-12-21 20:54:17 Although thats assuming i know what everything else in between. It very well could be big oil, endless wars, deregulate wall street, etc.
8319 2018-12-21 20:54:17 still have a terrible headache but i need to get my ass up and get an oil change and go look for something to wear tonight. ;)
8320 2018-12-21 20:54:08 This was my favourite. Do not boil and throw away the water. Add tomatoes, onions, cooking oil, salt and do not overcook.
8321 2018-12-21 20:54:06 It all started getting a jump on the taco meat for tomorrow’s caroling and taco party. Leftover bones led to making a bone broth that yielded some garlic infused olive oil that is quickly leading up to what will be my first risotto attempt. Hold my beer...
8322 2018-12-21 20:54:04 Some kind of redemption policies would be a good start. Rebuilding efforts that are real and not just shelling out to contractors for oil and resource interests. Building partnerships. We can find billions for walls and wars but not a drop for us or regions we "stabilized".
8323 2018-12-21 20:54:01 My car just sent me an email saying it's time for my 2nd oil change and tire rotation. 

I'm about to send it an email saying the sun's out, it's 59°, I don't have to pick up my grandson, I don't buy gifts, so I'm about to . 

Can it read emojis?

8324 2018-12-21 20:53:56 First things first, get an oil change.
8325 2018-12-21 20:53:56 using coconut oil as lube is great because of the plausible deniability 

“oh, are you making smoothies? :)”
“yeah, some nice fresh santorums”
8326 2018-12-21 20:53:50 Someone: So tell me about yourself.
Me: Well I really like coffee.
Someone: Oh, me too!  What's your favorite?  Do you prefer foreign or domestic?
Me: Well whatever they have in the Jiffy Lube waiting room while you get your oil changed?  Man.  That just turns my day to eleven.
8327 2018-12-21 20:53:47 Yea, but what about Germany and Europe (EU). If they are going to buy the oil and gas out of Russia with hard currency, then your plan fails. There is no other option but a cold war but how do you have a cold war in Europe if the Germans are doing all the business with them?
8328 2018-12-21 20:53:40 Females when they oil change light come on .... This little light of mineeee I’m gonna let it shineeee 
8329 2018-12-21 20:53:27 Guessing Oklahoma- has possibility of big oil $ with lower cost of living
8330 2018-12-21 20:53:15 A/D is still declining into the close.  Maybe they got swallowed up by a huge wave of oil.
8331 2018-12-21 20:53:14 Are those oil paintings?

#yyccc #ableg #abpoli
8332 2018-12-21 20:53:09 Baby oil isn't vegan because it's made of babies
8333 2018-12-21 20:53:03 That must cost a small fortune. I was going to make CBD oil. Need more weed.. much more ;-)
8334 2018-12-21 20:52:56 Also banks, oil & gas, food etc etc
8335 2018-12-21 20:52:42 Biotech, oil, consumer, construction, electricity or technology stocks, all down with the same pattern!! Mankind is not master of his own work! Just stopp artificial intelligence for stock market. Traditional and booooooring trading!
8336 2018-12-21 20:52:39 Obama didn't care about the Kurds when we got into Syria. It was always about ISIS on the outside, and about control of gas and oil in the inside.
8337 2018-12-21 20:52:38 Evan's original point (correct me if I'm wrong) was that $CDN moves in correlation to CDN R/E prices, not Oil.
8338 2018-12-21 20:52:37 i remember but i called but hawke uses oil as being trans
8339 2018-12-21 20:52:36 This isn't unheard of in Houston, especially for petroleum eng or geologist grads working at oil cos. The donations part is likely tithes to a church. I do find the lack of student loans suspicious though.
8340 2018-12-21 20:52:22 Wait, Germany is the largest economy in Europe and they essentially run the EU. They are stating quite clearly that they are going through with this Nordstream pipeline from Russia. Schroeder (Chancellor before Merkel) sits on the board of Gazprom, the Russian oil giant. soooo?
8341 2018-12-21 20:52:19 Cook this one with tomatoes, onions, mhiripiri, cooking oil, salt and pinch of soda and full cream milk. You can also  add dowi and serve with straight run mealie meal or njera or mhunga.
8342 2018-12-21 20:52:09 Time for oil change, intake manifold gasket went bad, valve cover gasket leaking, and my exhaust came loose lmao
8343 2018-12-21 20:52:09 Hope your not the one buying groceries when I’m trying to grab an oil filter and get out quick. 
8344 2018-12-21 20:52:01 You used always be like “Ryan wear a bun.” And I’m like “girl no!!!!”. But yeah! Lots of oil! Castor oil!
8345 2018-12-21 20:52:00 Cbc oil 30:1 or 1:1,  how does the ratio of cbd/thc work?  Lookin at cbd 20:1 for $130 also lookin at 20:1 for $60.
One is extract the ot...
8346 2018-12-21 20:52:00 All them meddle east country’s depend on oil to pay their people welfare they have no infrastructure except oil now you know how to defeat them drill your own oil
8347 2018-12-21 20:51:59 Sounds so wonderful. Dakota you say. And what lands are being destroyed/fracked? Seems odd if all this were true, why do we still buy ME oil? I’m thinking there’s a missing piece somewhere.
8348 2018-12-21 20:51:55 He wouldn’t answer but I fear the implications of recalcitrance for the guy who doesn’t sit on the world’s oil might be somewhat worse.
8349 2018-12-21 20:51:55 You can infuse onion in oil alone, remove onions and proceed with recipe. Fructans in onion are water-soluble so will not leach into oil.
8350 2018-12-21 20:51:54 At least they didn't ask the oil and gas industry to pay their fair share.
8351 2018-12-21 20:51:53 I know these people better not take forever with this oil change
8352 2018-12-21 20:51:52 The way it's going it's going to happen here, work as a carer, low wages oil prices have dropped 30 dollars in the last few weeks but price at the pumps don't match. It's time for the yellow jackets here I think
8353 2018-12-21 20:51:51 US war with Persians NOT in RU interests now? For self-perceived role as Great ME Peacemakers, not controlling hydrocarbons for 20 years, Oh-No-No, may need Israel neutered & paid, for future Oil & Gas plans @ humongous Iran South Pars & Qatar North fields. All just posturing...?
8354 2018-12-21 20:51:48 rosehip oil and a face scrub!
8355 2018-12-21 20:51:46 Coconut oil is trash for your hair
8356 2018-12-21 20:51:41 Babe do you add some oil when you put it in the oven or nah. Also is this in your cook book?
8357 2018-12-21 20:51:36 When you're told it'll be an hour and a half to get through the oil change and new tires, but still waiting over 2.5 hours later... 
8358 2018-12-21 20:51:36 Jamaican black castor oil lol. Naw that’s just that iPhone XS Max boo 
8359 2018-12-21 20:51:04 So to be clear the war was to have a pipeline through Syria from Saudi to get oil to EU cheaper but Assad had made his deal with Russia years ago & was happy with it so told Obama to bugger off that’s why Obama started the war
8360 2018-12-21 20:50:55 Lil Fizz BETTER be using some castor oil to grow that ponytail back out for this tour. I wanna get taken ALL the way back. Omarion too!
8361 2018-12-21 20:50:46 Where is all the money going from the sale of public land for private profit? Back to the endless cycle of tax breaks and campaign donations. In order to buy more pirated federal land and wage more Wars to protect or sell oil.
8362 2018-12-21 20:50:43 nah this one uses it to gauge oil
8363 2018-12-21 20:50:42 POTUS!  How about this!  Dig a trench from the gulf to the pacific! Then:  2 choices:  fill it with oil, gasoline, kerosene, and hit it with a torch! Then you have a blazing barrier!  Cross at your own risk!  Just like on JFK GRAVE-an eternal !
Choice 2:   ( next tweet)
8364 2018-12-21 20:50:37 What? I don't use olive oil. I use an actual ear drop wax removal. 
8365 2018-12-21 20:50:33 That has to be really frustrating. I walk around saying the word of what I am looking for so I don’t forget or get distracted. Any supplements help? Prevegen,fish oil,coconut oil, or some herbs?
8366 2018-12-21 20:50:28 It was spiced up by frying a mix of yellow and black mustard seeds in oil before stirring them in, and with a significant grating of mature cheddar on top
8367 2018-12-21 20:50:24 Deadlifts, squats, niacin (not flush free), fish oil, d3, ubiquinol/Co-q10. These, from my own experience, work to reverse heart disease. 

Notice: No big pharma required.

@nntaleb @ScottAdamsSays
8368 2018-12-21 20:50:21 We have not been involved as much with Germany on that issue, if we get the backbone bank we could do a boycot on Russian oil, Putins main source of income

8371 2018-12-21 20:50:01 Colombia’s state oil co. @ECOPETROL_SA announced a new block is added to another pre-salt block won jointly w/ BP and CNOOC. Ecopetrol will hold a 10% WI in the Saturno block. #Brazil
8372 2018-12-21 20:49:40 The middle east is the goose that laid the "oily" golden egg. For decades ourleaders humanity has been measured in barrels per day. Exactly like Hitler in WW2, Washington and Wall Street want ME oil and pipelines in Ukraine & Turkey.
8373 2018-12-21 20:49:38 Haha yes, I do see. I'm sorry you get clogged ears so regularly, but at least your olive oil does the trick.  xxxx

8375 2018-12-21 20:49:28 THANKS DAD. Going to the library today because that’s how I do on Friday nights  (and Thrive Market was for Whole30 condiments, butter, and oil!)
8376 2018-12-21 20:49:19 STOP developing dirty oil from the TAR sands!  Albertas support for oil companies who are killing all life on earth must STOPfind clean alternatives

8378 2018-12-21 20:48:57 I bought a car from a dealership who told me my warranty was over and wouldn’t fix anything. I was always told “The squeaky wheel gets the oil”. I am bringing the car to the shop next week and everything is getting repaired at no cost to me
8379 2018-12-21 20:48:56 I pay £20 into my account a month, then blow it on the Christmas box and an additional case. Christmas box this year was 13 bottles of wine, prosecco, champagne, my favourite gin, port, beer, olive oil and glasses.

8381 2018-12-21 20:48:54 Makes sense, Obama led the way on increased oil production.
8382 2018-12-21 20:48:50 Obama & his globalists masters supported ISSL to destabilise Syria to push Russia energy out & sell billions in arms at the same time. Genie oil has been drilling in the golan heights between Israel & Syria illegal board members are W Bush Cheney Rupert Murdock Rothchilds

8386 2018-12-21 20:48:21 So, let me get this straight. USA "overpays" NATO so Germany pays less to NATO while Germany pays Russia for oil, however, we created NATO to defend Europe from Russia. You can't make this shit up!

But we can't #BuildTheWall ?!

WTF?! Liberals are fuckin' stupid.

8387 2018-12-21 20:48:21 Don't forget about all that oil in Syria. You just know Putin will get a cut of that.

8390 2018-12-21 20:48:00 Oil didn't make new low today despite the drop in SPY. Oil long play with tight stop a good idea too?
8391 2018-12-21 20:47:45 Let's not kid ourselves into thinking trump won't expand other wars or start new ones. This isn't a `Trump Doctrine' retrenchment; it's just a reconfiguration of American Empire. His policies are incoherent except as they relate to oil exploitation and enrichment of oligarchies.
8392 2018-12-21 20:47:42 Lucky me I fried it before and threw everything, the oil, washed and washed the pot and my gas multiple times to remove the stupid smell

8395 2018-12-21 20:47:24 Ummm.... aren't the oil fields in Syria?  
How can Bashar Assad "take over" oil fields that belong to Syria. 
You mean "take back"?  
From those they don't belong to?

8402 2018-12-21 20:47:07 Ohhh Catherine!! I do NOT support you in your so called battle for the environment. If you cared about the environment you would promote businesses in Canada that produce responsible oil rather than allow Quebec to buy Saudi oil and ship it across the world!!

8405 2018-12-21 20:46:44 Turkey will come and get the Syrian oil fields..  unless of course the Syrian state and Russia come to the defense of the Kurds and Yezides..

8407 2018-12-21 20:46:23 So we should end the billions of subsidies to oil corps? You know, to ‘level the playing field’ for once.
8408 2018-12-21 20:46:14 $65 internet. $100 phone.  $200 in oil. $100 in electricity. $920 in mortgage. Yeah.  I WISH my bills were so low. 
8409 2018-12-21 20:46:03 The fickle industry has built this nation’s foundation and prosperity for the past 100 years? Not to mention paying for all the social welfare in this commusocialist state. To clarify; oil companies don’t pull out and abandon employees when the economy is good do they?
8410 2018-12-21 20:46:01 You don finish the oil for una house Abi

8419 2018-12-21 20:45:01 I can't believe it I actually agree with that decision we have been there too long and the Afghan people should be able to protect themselves by now. I think the reason is maybe corporations control your oil fields. Let them protect themselves already! Charity begins at home.
8420 2018-12-21 20:44:42 What do you add to oil to make it boil?
#think_wisely
8421 2018-12-21 20:44:38 I don’t straighten it a lot. I just do buns and oil. Back to back.
8422 2018-12-21 20:44:38 Vitamin E oil and rub on the scar everyday
8423 2018-12-21 20:44:36 @Onnit I recently bought your mct oil and I’m impressed do you guys have any samples of other products I could try?
8424 2018-12-21 20:44:36 I'm not burning the midnight oil! I'll try to change things, whatever it takes.
8425 2018-12-21 20:44:36 Which essential oil is the best for getting people off ya dick?
8426 2018-12-21 20:44:28 My hood homegirls always thoughr I was boogie cuz, as broke as I was, I just wasn't with buying footwear from the same place I got my pink oil moisturizer.  
8427 2018-12-21 20:44:24 Oil?
8428 2018-12-21 20:44:22 Well, correction, it’s usually naked if I’m putting lotion on or handling any type of hair oil or getting dirty while cooking.. but das it! Haha.
8429 2018-12-21 20:44:08 all you guys want is a pipe line running through Syria for your oil buddies to challenge Russians monopoly of gas to Europe. It is always about money (&power) with u guys.
8430 2018-12-21 20:44:06 castor oil!!! 
8431 2018-12-21 20:44:03 first time all sorts of sick this year 

decided to knock this w/  coconut oil,  tea tree oil &  oregano oil ... it’s working 
8432 2018-12-21 20:43:49 People fall for an obvious snake oil salesmen and this is the consequence.
8433 2018-12-21 20:43:48 Bless! I gotta get some and say no more, I got some black walnut oil drops that I’m gonna add for now.
8434 2018-12-21 20:43:47 For real tho, I had to go to the nearest gas station for oil and we filled it now I think it’s the battery smh. And got no jumping cables in this damn SUV.
8435 2018-12-21 20:43:46 Does an oil rig count? Thanks can pull a friend into this.... 
8436 2018-12-21 20:43:23 I find epsom salt/Dead Sea salt baths with essential oil helps to detox and take in minerals...You will know what is right for...will feel right and you just ‘know’.
8437 2018-12-21 20:43:22 If level playing field means giving the worst possible service to your customers subsidised by state oil or not, then delta does indeed play on the levelest playing field.
8438 2018-12-21 20:43:18 The graph ends in the 2014/15 fiscal year and I did not think it covered the recession. Harper's last budget presented was in surplus, but the minor recession and oil crisis dipped it into deficit by around 1/2% during the election. They disputed it, but left off stuff.
8439 2018-12-21 20:43:12 Instead of being dependent on foreign oil for gasoline, the deep state wants us dependent on Afghanistan for the $8,000 battery packs we will have to replace in our cars every few years.
8440 2018-12-21 20:43:11 What habitats that haven't yet been poisoned by industrial toxins or oil are now being rendered unlivable for adapted species by man-made climate change
8441 2018-12-21 20:43:05 True. On the other hand the oil patch has been one of the only sources of high paying jobs for non-college graduates this decade.
8442 2018-12-21 20:43:00 Oil no dy the brain.. The brain Don knock
8443 2018-12-21 20:42:59 I reported and blocked them for this. It’s targeted harassment of millennials and a big oil’ buncha lies.
8444 2018-12-21 20:42:48 foodstuff (rice, veg oil and chicken)
8445 2018-12-21 20:42:46 We’ll lose our roads if we don’t use the oil. We’ll be going back to dirt roads since the sludge at the bottom of the oil barrel and rocks is what we use to make asphalt
8446 2018-12-21 20:42:40 It's not going to work...We won't be handing over the 39 billion without a total copulation to the nut jobs and snake oil salesmen who have sold us down the river..While leading us up the garden path...trust me we are not dead and buried  yet. .Help us don't abandon us..Love EU
8447 2018-12-21 20:42:26 What is apricot oil though?
8448 2018-12-21 20:42:10 Each state can generate billions of Naira if they harness their human capital and resources properly instead of relying solely on oil money from the Federal government of Nigeria. #Nigeria
8449 2018-12-21 20:42:02 Oil changes
8450 2018-12-21 20:41:40 venezuelas main export isn't actually oil its short women with short hair and glasses and red lipstick

8452 2018-12-21 20:41:31 my oil a ride me
8453 2018-12-21 20:41:21 And the thing is the guy is so transparent you don’t need to be sherolck to see he is a snake oil salesman. He was projecting throughout his campaign. Every single accusation he threw at Hillary, wa his very own crime. From the foundation scams all the way to the collusion.
8454 2018-12-21 20:41:19 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!
8455 2018-12-21 20:41:17 How soon until t pushes for relief for those he sold stock market snake oil to?
8456 2018-12-21 20:41:15 Yeah adding onions, tomatoes, olive oil , some spices and chilli sauce greatly helps!
8457 2018-12-21 20:40:55 Who would have thought that a government would have the rights to oil and gas in its own land.
8458 2018-12-21 20:40:53 Motor oil is just carbecue sauce
8459 2018-12-21 20:40:50 Amen...keep the oil in the lamp.
8460 2018-12-21 20:40:43 are you special... the rally's are being held because 100s of 1000s of people are out of work. also alot of these people do have trades skills etc. welding. also do you drive because if you do then you rely on oil and gas and more than likely live in Ontario or BC .
8461 2018-12-21 20:40:43 ...search for more markets to sell to meaning getting our oil to shorelines. The inability to ship all of the oil produced costs AB about $40Million per day. 
3. Recent pipeline proposals have been the most environmentally intense, heaviest regulated in history, setting...

8466 2018-12-21 20:40:19 @sullivanradio 
1. ISIS got beaten up very bad.
2. US arms won't slip into ISIS hands like it happened during Obama's time.
3. ISIS no longer has money to pay their militias (no oil sale revenue).

These are decent reasons for Trump to pull out, except Kurd's future. #MAGA
8467 2018-12-21 20:40:14 I had no idea snake oil was a real thing..
8468 2018-12-21 20:40:08 I’m considering even shorting oil and gas lol we going to get some cheap ass gas prices soon

8473 2018-12-21 20:39:58 So a truck loaded with bags of rice.. looks like most companies do rice and oil Christmas package 
8474 2018-12-21 20:39:44 definitely just ate a small can of olive oil tuna for breakfast because I don't feel like eating anything else
8475 2018-12-21 20:39:27 i took my car in to get an oil change (on time for once) and they were like nothing is wrong with it everything is good IT BETTER BE ITS 8 MONTHS OLD HOW DARE YOU EVEN SUGGEST
8476 2018-12-21 20:39:21 @marksandspencer I looked through your Christmas treats; found next to nothing that you haven’t stuffed with Palm Oil! Shame on you, it’s bad for us and you are destroying the environment through your support of this unwanted & unhealthy ingredient! #PalmOil
8477 2018-12-21 20:39:20 I got burnt compressor oil spilt In my truck and it smells like I have 10 dead whores in my truck lol
8478 2018-12-21 20:38:48 That Mr Tire oh we got cheap oil change for you then be like oh btw you need some new brakes and tires that don’t really need to be changed. Oh and let’s not forget about that filter bs.

8480 2018-12-21 20:37:50 1. Oil is being phased out, but it will take quite a while if we want to balance not going bankrupt with green energy. Understanding that it’s still a cornerstone of AB and Canada is essential when having this discussion. 
2. With the price of oil dropping AB has had to....
8481 2018-12-21 20:37:49 I truly can’t how anyone can volte liberal with the way Justin Trudeau is ruining this great country.  Spending out of control, immigration out of control, giving our sovereignty away to the UN, and he is certainly not helping the oil industry. He is an embarrassment!!
8482 2018-12-21 20:37:49 Both vessels are on an almost head on collision at their current doped and bearing.
We also have oil tanker seacod in the immediate vicinity as well. Which is a laden crude oil tanker
8483 2018-12-21 20:37:48 Washed my hair and greased my scalp with Wild Growth oil and blew it out.. my room smell like a Rasta house
8484 2018-12-21 20:37:45 By Design Hillary/Liar OBAMA FRAUD Created ISIS
Was Not IRAQ
Recruited Encouraged/Paid Arranged Fighters From EU/Around World For ISIS

Dems.OBAMA Allowed ISIS Selling Oil&Ship
OBAMA Shielded ISIS & Did Not Fight ISIS

8485 2018-12-21 20:37:33 #COT = spec book for #oil as of 12/18/18, net long 309,608; change of 102 or 0.03% from prev. 309,506; 41.89% of 739,097 max on 02/06/18
8486 2018-12-21 20:37:29 2/2 Just think of our grandparents who did not have all today's modern conveniences. On prairies put stones in oven to warm them up and put at foot of kids beds.  There would be frost on inside of windows on farm.  They would stand around cook stove to stay warm.  Oil lanterns.
8487 2018-12-21 20:37:03 前回サプるか悩んだので嬉しいです！
ナーフされてなければなおのことかでしたが、今金剛を入れるか悩みますね…ｗ
8488 2018-12-21 20:36:56 agree, longer term into next year, oil has much more to go..should have clarified ..in the very short term (as in now)

8492 2018-12-21 20:36:39 CBD oil is the fuckin’ truth for aches and pains 
8493 2018-12-21 20:36:29 I feel for you, seriously. From Bayern's point of view, though, if they lose ground to the oil barons out there, they might never catch up again.
8494 2018-12-21 20:36:23 The country needs to get back at @jamieoliver and ban olive oil.
8495 2018-12-21 20:36:16 Oil and gas money. Go figure...

That’ll teach me to not be so lazy and to make my own.
8498 2018-12-21 20:35:37 My only intention in 2019 is to finally join the beard gang. Few folks have suggested biotin supplements and lots of argan oil. Any advice or suggestions? CC: @bevel
8499 2018-12-21 20:35:35 my cbd oil finally got here and my mom came in my room and slipped it into my hand and whispered “your weed is here”
8500 2018-12-21 20:35:21 Try lavender essential oils and Yogi Bedtime Tea! Put the oil on your upper chest and wrists before bed and then drink a cup of tea before going to bed. This is my nightly routine!
8501 2018-12-21 20:35:00 I just dont see this think bottoming out finally until we hit $20. All we need is a strong dollar now, which is very much looking on the card for 2019. Lets see, it'll bounce soon but I cant see it holding (oil) and the dollar is becoming my key focus after todays price action.
8502 2018-12-21 20:34:53 Social change in Saudi = the king ( or his prince) says jump- ppl and the media says how high ! It’s only for show! In anyway, One cannot should not spoon feed democracy, equality! Ps. Stop bombing ng #yemen for oil!

8504 2018-12-21 20:34:43 Okay. If they can just mimic us, where will Canada grow all its produce? Where will Mexico magically get its oil and more space to grow crops?

8515 2018-12-21 20:32:51 Richard N. Haass considers that  Donald Trump  fits in the category of the "Reluctant Sheriff " and is  dismantling America's global footprint. 
Yet, the oil market seems undisturbed by this fact. 
Less geopolitical influence in the price formation process should be expected  !!

8517 2018-12-21 20:32:22 @kilmeade Brian here’s the MEast plan. Pull out completely. Israel will take out Assad by air. Saudi’s will help. Next target Iran, & Palestine will wave the white flag. Putin thinks he outsmarted Trump. Oil at $45 no accident. Russia runs out of $$$ anything under $50 a barrel
8518 2018-12-21 20:32:18 Did you think about that BoC would need to drastically drop CAD in order to keep the Canadian economy competitive? We have two major industry in Canada: Oil and Real Estate, and both falling now.
8519 2018-12-21 20:32:14 Waiting to get my oil changed and there are only men’s magazines to read. Breaking news, but women drive cars too.
8520 2018-12-21 20:32:07 I don't know why bc we're the number one oil producer in the world not them.
8521 2018-12-21 20:31:45 I sometimes have trouble too. Have you tried a beer shower? Hot shower/bath while drinking ice cold beer. Then pjs and some bedtime or chamomile tea. White noise machine and lavender oil helps too. Works for me. Good luck-sleep is important!
8522 2018-12-21 20:31:37 "OIL CITY"  MAY 11, 2019 Ya gotta love the smell of diesel in the morning! Crude has to be seriously cooked at boiling temps to make high octane products.

8523 2018-12-21 20:31:33 I’m sorry to say but @realDonaldTrump coal fires  are excellent can’t afford oil coal is a cheaper alternative sorry environment but my life matters I don’t want to freeze
8524 2018-12-21 20:31:29 Thanks to lobbying from gas & oil companies something like that will probably never happen in the United States
8525 2018-12-21 20:31:03 well it turns a himalayan salt lamp and an essential oil diffuser are not a viable alternative to clinical therapy
8526 2018-12-21 20:31:02 Iran sells into the open market when permitted. Why would Iranian control be worse than American control? American oil companies are not international charities.
8527 2018-12-21 20:30:55 Me thinks it's time for someone to start a GoFundMe for some vats of boiling oil, crossbows and a few trebuchets.
8528 2018-12-21 20:30:46 Blend 3 pints dumplings with 8 oz cheese. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Drain. Serve over kale.
8529 2018-12-21 20:30:41 Exactly and WE cannot Chang them!  Either make some glass outa that sand or let them kill each other. We have our own oil & gas!
8530 2018-12-21 20:30:40 Why would u add oil
8531 2018-12-21 20:30:39 YES!! Used to make them as a little girl. I used GF flour and I didn’t have shortening so I subbed coconut oil  might be tropical flavor  but they smell good
8532 2018-12-21 20:30:38 Well, one of the great things about this country is people can have differing opinions...  i agree on the refining, however refineries are insanely expensive to build, so oil companies work to make sure refineries that are already in existence run at 100%...
8533 2018-12-21 20:30:37 @silkdynastystx Are u buying oil here or still see  lower prices???
8534 2018-12-21 20:30:19 What is ‘Satisfried’? Dinah’s Chicken is “Fried Under Pressure”.   Sealing the juices of the chicken in and keeping the cooking oil from penetrating.
8535 2018-12-21 20:30:05 @ajmitchell do oil and water go together?!
8536 2018-12-21 20:30:04 What are you talking about? Dig out of car wreck drama much lol FYI most cars have warning lights for oil an tires do it off to the side if needed.
8537 2018-12-21 20:29:57 @realDonaldTrump You are losing the support of the oil industry as fast as you possible could. If you are going to screw up every single decision you make, maybe you shouldn’t destroy your supporters lively hood in all industries.
8538 2018-12-21 20:29:46 What have you done sir to change the narrative? You have been a Senator pocketing twelve million oil money monthly without shame while the Niger Deltans are dying of hunger. Busybody!
8539 2018-12-21 20:29:41 Plus we can always use those oil revenues that paid for the Iraq invasion
8540 2018-12-21 20:29:40 Nothing more pathetic than watching neoliberals spew neocon talking points about why the US has to police the middle east in perpetuity.  They pretend to be humanitarians, while their backers salivate over the "oil bonanza" they've discovered in the Golan Heights.

8549 2018-12-21 20:28:47 'THEY' WANT THEIR OIL AND GAS  AND HUGE AMOUNT OF GOLD. HOPE VENEZUELANS CAN SEE THAT AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. LET'S STOP THIS MADNESS . PAY FAIR PRICE. AND PEACE WILL BE UPON US.
8550 2018-12-21 20:28:45 Great, you posted the exact moment oil reached its high for the day.
8551 2018-12-21 20:28:45 Oil and migrant Pipelines form Canada's  Nationalism.  

For Alberta and the NDP(Notley's dippers), it is existential.   Migration and multi-culturalism both really loud  Dog-whistles piercing social cohesion and public safety.
8552 2018-12-21 20:28:42 Not “man made CO2”. It is ancient carbon that had been removed from Earth’s ancient, hot, toxic atmosphere millions of years ago, by ancient life forms and sequestered as coal, oil and gas. Now we burn these, releasing CO2 into our atmosphere. “Residency”isn’t the time it remains
8553 2018-12-21 20:28:38 Merry Christmas and happy New year 2019 to everyone. So like in other years ago, I hope that we have good news to Renewables Energies and all kinds of energy. Why not?! Because in Mexico wish to recover the oil industry. Maybe some years more. 
8554 2018-12-21 20:28:22 I want one!!

8557 2018-12-21 20:27:50 Glad I went on and got my oil changed 
8558 2018-12-21 20:27:49 Why not do something productive to slow climate change instead of the usual gesture politics. Maybe start by cutting the UKs reliance on burning fossil fuels for energy, put a stop to fracking and deep sea oil extraction and look seriously at nuclear power as a clean alternative
8559 2018-12-21 20:27:47 Any CBD oil supplies in Australia? I would like to give it a go.
8560 2018-12-21 20:27:42 Good news for growth but it won't last long even oil production in America is increasing. Not enough for growth stimulation compared to high interest rates and low inflation.
8561 2018-12-21 20:27:22 Are we looking at oil companies trying to sell down the build in oil reserves?

One argument is the slide in oil prices is demand driven. Some are saying that demand is soaring.

The other argument is supply rose too fast to chase the higher prices this past Summer. 
8562 2018-12-21 20:27:13 Lying about him taking donations from oil companies, when those donations came from workers of said companies, is ad hominem.
8563 2018-12-21 20:27:01 Why does my car need some expensive ass oil

8566 2018-12-21 20:26:39 Dip a clean mascara stick or a cotton swab in warm coconut oil ( or any oil on the list) carefully on your lashes before going to bed leave it over night then wash it out with warm water repeat daily

8568 2018-12-21 20:26:25 Oil?
8569 2018-12-21 20:26:24 Pep would be an average manager if it weren't for oil money.
8570 2018-12-21 20:26:21 And yet he has no shame.. All in the name of opposition. Smh
8571 2018-12-21 20:26:09 @DNC Dems block the Green New Deal that even 64% of Republicans support, put Kathy Castor as head of house climate panel, refuses to bar corrupt oil money from the panel, and the DNC wonders why young people don't trust them. Castor got $73,000 from the energy industry btw.
8572 2018-12-21 20:25:57 #Agile so called “professionals” are oil snake salesman who failed as IT professionals but found a niche where they can make money selling bullshit.

8575 2018-12-21 20:25:47 my parents really played me. So I finally get my license (that they been bugging me to get FOREVER) and we have another car they said would be mine and my mom just told me the stickers are expired and that the oil is leaking so I can only drive to work or the store with it. Wow
8576 2018-12-21 20:25:41 I don't know to be honest. They are essential oil diffusers but different kind of. You breath in your mouth out your nose but like you don't really inhale. They are weird but I actually like them a lot. Zen is my favorite.
8577 2018-12-21 20:25:37 nah once they hit the oil burner again they won’t feel all the brain matter floating around
8578 2018-12-21 20:25:33 Tom next to our nuclear arsenal I strongly believe that our greatest military weapon is the American economy-because of the oil glut Russia is suffering greatly & if we do things right we may be able to topple Iran with sanctions & other intense pressure @sullivanradio

8584 2018-12-21 20:24:52 Ofc the one time i go by myself to get my oil changed it takes over an hour
8585 2018-12-21 20:24:46 Using a soft rag, apply a thin coat of oil to the face, edges, toe and back of the bat - it is very important not to over oil.
8586 2018-12-21 20:24:40 They’re not fighting for oil in Syria, you imbecile, they went there to help the Kurds fight ISIS.

8589 2018-12-21 20:24:18 Amtrak doesn't see any risks, as were reported in the resent climate change report. Wjat? Are they blind or blindfold by big oil?
8590 2018-12-21 20:24:13 Today's least favorite cusromer The woman who came in for an oil change, went shopping in the main store, came back amd had me cash all of it out. 600$ worth of smaller items. My bg rack holds one back and I have a hand scanner not a slide scanner.

8592 2018-12-21 20:24:05 The Middle East is a cesspool of eternal conflicts that will likely never cease, & t/USA’s persistent meddling in foreign affairs exasperates tensions that will never come to a peaceful end, no matter how many decades go by. T/facade of human rights issues dies in t/face of $OIL
8593 2018-12-21 20:24:03 Let me guess, brought a dust cover, some oil and some electrical wire to comfort it?

What part of climate calamity do you not understand? To curb emissions in time to save our species and ecosystem we must end oil now. Your criminal deeds of the past 40 years are now understood & your profits do not trump the planet’s health.

8605 2018-12-21 20:22:59 Maybe give 1.6 billion in green incentives instead of wasting it on the oil industry?
8606 2018-12-21 20:22:56 Eso es lo q t contaron, la realidad es otra. Brasil y Argentina son principalmente agroexportadores, Brasil se vio muy beneficioso x la explotación d oil presal.

8611 2018-12-21 20:22:26 The US is in the middle east for oil. They aren't there for humanitarian reasons. If they actually gave a shit about human lives then they would stop selling weapons to Israel and Saudi Arabia while they bomb Palestinians and Yemenis.
8612 2018-12-21 20:22:22 I smell like baby oil, I’m doing dead sea mud mask and playing Assasins Creed, I love Fridays.
8613 2018-12-21 20:22:22 Colder air causes the tire pressure to drop, just add air, usually free to $1.50. Oil change is needed doesn’t mean it has to be immediately, you could possibly wait until next pay day and not stress over Christmas. Tire pressure higher priority but quick /cheap

8617 2018-12-21 20:21:59 Legal Hemp is huge. Hemp matures in 120 days. Produce more pulp than trees for paper. Fibers strong enough to build fighter jets, produces more oil than peanuts, no pesticides, and the oil can run vehicles. Thanks President Trump!
8618 2018-12-21 20:21:56 You're absolutely right we've been there in many years already and charity begins at home there is no reason that the Afghan people cannot protect themselves by now. The only reason I could think of that was still there is corporate control of the oil fields.Bring our troops home
8619 2018-12-21 20:21:46 Our Earth's mantle can be stabilized by a slurry of plastic, rubber, and refuse pumped into crude oil extraction points by reversing the drilling rigs operation with ships filled with the slurry, thereby calming Gulfstream effects of our weather.

Instead the US is again faced with a federal government shut down. The US is really being made great again
8643 2018-12-21 20:18:51 Saudia still the leader of oil produsers so it still conrol oil prices

8646 2018-12-21 20:18:45 You must've read my mind! I'm just trying to devise a recipe for a low #FODMAP curry. Can you infuse onion in oil the same way you can with garlic? Or does it leach too many FODMAPs?
8647 2018-12-21 20:18:44 4) So in summary,until govt finally approves full deregulation of PMS,potential for subsidy(under-recovery)will still be there once crude oil price gets above $60/bbl.
Lastly, 'subsidy' is technically incorrect since it isn't paid to anyone,NNPC is selling below PMS cost price.
8648 2018-12-21 20:18:43 Another lie used by big coal/oil is the supposed thousands of scientists who disagree re:climate change -which is actually a website where anyone can claim to be a Scientist w/ no verification (many are doctors, less than .01% are climatologists) yet this is used to discredit
8649 2018-12-21 20:18:40 Totally, whole situation is a clusterfuck to appease big oil

White helmets make some propaganda films and Assad has to go

But it's fine for Saudi to do as it pleases in Yeman, and NATO even gives real time satellite feeds to target strikes...

8652 2018-12-21 20:18:23 First of all charity begins at home and these Afghan people we are supposedly protecting should be able to protect themselves by now. Are you sure we are not looting the oil fields and that's the reason we are still there? There is no reason we should still be there.

I'm sure not every oil employee is voting for the guy who will keep their employment, but many are! Many aren't donating to a guy who will shut them down

8657 2018-12-21 20:17:46 That our leaders have sacrificed so much to maintian control of the middle east oil is sickening. A million dead, millions now refugees, 10's of millions now living in rubble?
Who profits? Wall Street? Thier puppets in our goverment?
Their propoganda machine, the media?
8658 2018-12-21 20:17:33 Lol how many times have OTHER countries tried to correct this. Soviets tried and failed. We tried and fail. California is blowin up with homeless people - let’s fix that. Let’s get off oil. Let’s get some healthcare. Our job isn’t to try to fix other countries.
8659 2018-12-21 20:17:22 They do have a predatory streak.  Philanthropy is more geared towards buying good will than altruistic motivation IMO.

8662 2018-12-21 20:17:08 This looks like the entire 2018 oil bull rally. Same set up. Months after months passed and the technicals said to buy the dip until the catalyst. I’m waiting for the catalyst for the 85% net long to unravel.  Not sure if it comes in Jan feb or march but if buying LE puts.

He knows his days are numbered and he’s going to damage the country as much as he can on his way out. Like Torching all the oil wells in Kuwait when we kicked what’s his face from Iraq.
8667 2018-12-21 20:16:36 If you stop taking fossil fuel out of the earth ie oil, a lot of the population would loose there jobs, and I'm one of them. Also I wouldn't be able to travel on my motorcycle any more. I agree we should do something about this situation, but don't blame the general public.

8682 2018-12-21 20:15:38 One example is the rich oil industry preventing electric vehicle production further delaying a switch from fossil fuels. Congress is bought with money. The lack of money holds poor people back obviously.

8684 2018-12-21 20:15:32 Pelosi chose Castor Oil and her tepid environmentalism. 

Business as usual.

#GreenNewDeal needs to call a March on Washington to get it through these fossils’ heads that fossil fuel money has no place on environmental committees.
8685 2018-12-21 20:15:18 Can’t sleep and you have body acne? Dilute some drops of lavender essential oil in water and spray it on your sheets and pillows every night. Lavender kills bacteria and the smell helps you relax and sleep!

8689 2018-12-21 20:14:57 The colors of the Giant Panda serves as camouflage which help the animals blend into the lights and shadows in their environment! Their black and white fur  is dense and filled with oil to keep warm and protect against water.
8690 2018-12-21 20:14:54 ISIS was decimated. When Trump came in, they held Mosul Iraq and Raqqa Syria, their capital Caliphate city and the land in between. Now they are a couple of pockets of losers with no oil revenue or taxes taken etc. Truly Decimated.
8691 2018-12-21 20:14:52 These are the global Consumption rankings for 2017 for Germany from the 2018 ed BP Statistical Review of Global Energy. Oil Rank 9, Coal (incl lignite) 8, Gas 8 and global CO2 emissions Rank 6. You need to see the whole picture. Media has a key role in telling the whole story.

8695 2018-12-21 20:14:27 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
8696 2018-12-21 20:14:19 You must be Liberal! Always using other peoples money, no sense of business that until there is clarity from Que, why throw money at it? Very telling that JT doesn't want to upset Que. Oil and gas is dead with this govt.
8697 2018-12-21 20:14:15 Politicians choked the life out of the oil industry and now we're reaping the rewards of a direct attack on a pillar of the Canadian economy. 2019 looks pretty grim.
8698 2018-12-21 20:14:10 Just for fun, Google 'Who owns the oil sands' and see how much of that would actually stay in Canada, in public hands.
By the way, I support the pipeline's construction, but it is not a panacea, just a good thing to do.
8699 2018-12-21 20:14:09 yeaa i just remembered about using oil lol i’ll do that tonight instead of suffering with discomfort thank you! i’ve never had the machine thing but it sounds v satisfying

8703 2018-12-21 20:13:26 Guys. Listen. Im sitting waiting for my oil change and this gross ass looking man gets up and starts wandering around. He walks up to the TV and then walks back right past me and conveniently drops a condom onto the floor right in front of me.

8707 2018-12-21 20:13:03 Is that oil in the coolant or already in drain tray ??
8708 2018-12-21 20:12:54 CBD oil should just be reclassified as sleeping pills.
8709 2018-12-21 20:12:51 Yesterday was so fun. We went to disneyland and brought in our oil pen and were just so stoned and drunk the whole time. Lemme tell you christmas time at disneyland high is amazinng
8710 2018-12-21 20:12:37 I sat in the bus quietly on my own, the man beside me started a conversation about the oil I was holding
Man: Which one is that one?  Is it part of your office package? 
Me: (reluctantly answers) yes
Man: How many kg be this? 
Me: I don't know (at this point I'm like )
8711 2018-12-21 20:12:25 i haate earblocks. have you called your GP? you usually have to use eardrops/warm oil for a few days and then wait til the nurse is available to sort it with that machine thing. the machine is vibes though. so satisfying. ive typed so many letters in this tweet about ear block
8712 2018-12-21 20:12:16 I would agree but I’ve carried on with some modelling so paint has replaced oil and iron 
8713 2018-12-21 20:12:12 well it's going to be forced on Israel within 20 years by the international community. Get ready for oil boycotts and total disinvestment if the Palestinian Apartheid situation isn't fixed. And Bibi's Bantustan "2 state" solution with Palestinians as vassals doesn't qualify
8714 2018-12-21 20:12:09 Or not, because our economies and resources are fundamentally different, with different available resources and products. You think Canada is a viable location for mass amounts of produce? Or that Mexico is viable for mass amounts of oil?

8717 2018-12-21 20:11:43 But did you read the pie chart? Internets only cost $20. And transportation (car payment, insurance, gas, oil changes, tolls, parking) are only $130. So we’re obviously messing up.
8718 2018-12-21 20:11:41 where are the allies? #Russia is one of the biggest oil, gas, wheat exporters in the world, and #Iran too!! #Assad today arrested the head of red crescent on charges of embezzlement and corruption, why don't Assad and #Makhloufe pay?!

8723 2018-12-21 20:11:03 This morning I woke up to an email from Hyundai in which they gifted me an oil change, tire rotation, and a filter replacement for $8.88.  
Too bad I don't need an oil change because it expires next week

8734 2018-12-21 20:09:49 No we don't but charity begins at home. We already been at war for many years and still failed to negotiate with the Taliban for some type of peace. Are these people were supposedly protecting incapable of protecting themselves or are we just really looting the oil wells?
8735 2018-12-21 20:09:41 And the problem is clearly demonstrated by the deniers on this thread alone -we won’t do anything because 35-40% of our country believes conservative propaganda and false “science” put out by oil and coal companies that tells people that predictions were wrong before etc..
8736 2018-12-21 20:09:37 If Trump's economy continues  spiraling downward, we will need another Obama. Trump has also ruined the Republican party.  Tried to take away health care. Build a border wall. Drill for oil in protected wildlife areas. Denied climate change
#TrumpResign
8737 2018-12-21 20:09:33 Yes it is.  Black, Asian and Hispanic all time record lows for unemployment.   Women lowest since the 1960s.  3.1million off of food stamps.  Dropping regulations that strangled business.   Opening up the pipeline that put America first in oil
8738 2018-12-21 20:09:29 hot oil splashed on my face and now im scared to look to see if i got burned  PRAY FOR ME
8739 2018-12-21 20:09:25 Canada was told he was being tortured (which included being dragged back and fourth in his own urine and pine oil**) and did not do anything. While no Canadian official tortured him, we kind of just looked the other way.

8752 2018-12-21 20:07:43 Apologies I didn’t notice the number of companies that went bankrupt in your tweet. I know of at least 10-15 companies that disappeared in the US and about 5 or so London listed oil companies! Bond holders can be unforgiving when debt covenants are breached!
8753 2018-12-21 20:07:28 Are they finite? Is the earth constantly creating new oil? We don't know the answers.
8754 2018-12-21 20:07:27 how about marijuana? is CBD oil the only tool for somethings or is there other cures? how about other medication? what country you live in?
8755 2018-12-21 20:07:22 CBD oil for the cure.
8756 2018-12-21 20:07:09 So sad half of US is brainwashed to think its OK to take over the middle east to steal oil and open more banks.
8757 2018-12-21 20:07:08 I'm reminded of Saddam Hussein setting all the oil wells on fire as his troops fled Kuwait.

Another malignant narcissist.

8764 2018-12-21 20:06:31 Oh, so there's no pipeline problem and everything in the Alberta oil market is peachy thanks to the Conservatives? Thanks for sharing!
8765 2018-12-21 20:06:11 2/2 My view is China aims (as Buyer of Last Resort) to assert buy-side market dominance, backed by massive storage capacity & buy-side benchmark. If China can cap product prices, crude oil will remain lower for longer. Asia buyers will join China: EU will probably also jump East
8766 2018-12-21 20:06:06 @ToyotaCanada @erinparktoyota My moms car is burning oil, and despite my best efforts to get a solution with you guys, after running through hoops with e-mails, twitter, phone calls etc, you guys REFUSE to help. NEVER EVER buy a Toyota, nothing but problems.

8786 2018-12-21 20:04:24 Implications to our national security:
1) Stop bombing civilians on behalf of oil companies; people stop hating the US
2) People stop hating the US; we won't need huge 'defense' spending
3) Take savings from reduced spending; put towards healthcare, infrastructure, and education.

A great wallowing & trotting out of #Genius thinking, relishing the tornado of inanity over #pipelines & oil & “we don’t get paid enough for it”.  Amazingly, in the end it took Rosie to squeak out ‘I guess we hafta get off oil’-no one cared
8789 2018-12-21 20:04:05 Shout out to all the E&Ps that hedged their 2018/2019 oil production at $55.  I'm sorry I doubted your judgement $SD

8792 2018-12-21 20:03:50 If youre the oil and gas industry, you should just say so.
Youre not for economic prosperity if you just want oil exploration with most of the revenue going to multinational corporations.

8821 2018-12-21 20:00:41 Trump and sense, is like oil & water..
8822 2018-12-21 20:00:17 Now how about some common sense.  1st, who cares of Russia has a stronghold there? For oil? Will they invest there and allow ISIS ot terrorists to run it NO. Why don't you go over there
8823 2018-12-21 20:00:15 No , in actual FACT the one commodity that Mr. Harper worked so diligently for 9 years to pin the Cdn $ to,,aka. OIL, saw it's value cut in half & a good portion of Gov't tax revenue with it. 
Add to this a President next door on a spending spree & I'd say 'We are where we are'.
8824 2018-12-21 20:00:12 this $CL oil crash is truly epic
8825 2018-12-21 20:00:03 Now playing I Need Your Oil by E. Dewey Smith, Jr. & The House of Hope Atlanta!
8826 2018-12-21 20:00:03 Now it's in my head.. taking the place of Smack Jack by Nina Hagen! Oil & water.
8827 2018-12-21 19:59:54  what does that mean ..something like how Saibaba lit diyas using water instead of oil ?
8828 2018-12-21 19:59:41 The smell of baby oil is intoxicating
8829 2018-12-21 19:59:24 Oh cool! This is made from coconut oil so it's all natural and is also cruelty-free, phthalate-free, non-GMO & vegan!

8832 2018-12-21 19:59:18 America vote for Hillary full stop! Purging voter's & throwing out mail in & provisional ballots! America has been attacked by greedy corporations tied to Koch's Network of Billionaires! Plus the Koch's invited Putin in? We know it's the Koch's & Big Oil Industry!This is real
8833 2018-12-21 19:59:17 1/2 In my analysis the market has been clouded for c15 yrs by financialisation of crude oil in tank, tanker or reservoir, via Enron-style prepay (sale & repurchase agreements)  #DarkInventory of oil is created & liquidated where beneficial interest is not where traders think
8834 2018-12-21 19:59:16 What will never happen nomonde and lindiwe are like water and oil
8835 2018-12-21 19:59:15 Fairbanks. It was for an oil concern. They had trouble keeping qualified techs up there for obvious reasons.
8836 2018-12-21 19:59:08 when i was 12 any type of oil was a huge fear food for me (it still kinda is) & one time i forgot that caramelized onions had oil in them so i started coughing and spitting them out but my family thought i was actually choking so i played along and pretended i almost died HDBDH
8837 2018-12-21 19:59:02 Sonic has a similar problem with the music. Composer of Sonic 1 and 2 has rights to those songs. They have to pay him every time they release em. It’s also why Green Hill, Chemical Plant And Oil Ocean aren’t on the official Sonic Mania soundtrack.
8838 2018-12-21 19:58:51 U.S. oil futures settle at lowest since July 2017, down over 11% for the week
8839 2018-12-21 19:58:47 Thank God for my CBD oil today  
8840 2018-12-21 19:58:40 you should definitely try cucumber fried in olive oil and when it’s done you need to add garlic, vinegar and salt
8841 2018-12-21 19:58:27 People don't want concern, they want policy goals. As long as Democratic contenders take money from the Oil and Gas industry, you can't say Sirota is lying (i.e. making a baseless claim). At most, you could say he is pessimistic.
8842 2018-12-21 19:58:25 coconut oil & tea tree oil
8843 2018-12-21 19:58:23 My oil options have gone all the way from zero down to zero the last couple days.
8844 2018-12-21 19:58:12 Just sitting here thinking of how much money our government waste on welfare for oil companies, bloated defense spending, and tax cuts to companies that are already worth billions. Imagine If that money went towards education, health care, and universal basic income imagine that!
8845 2018-12-21 19:58:11 When Assad's father was in charge the Saudis did the samething using the "Moslem Brotherhood " trying to create a civil war & topple Hafez Assad,but he was able to crush the so called rebels  ,Saudis wanted to use syria to send oil to Europe market & sell cheaper than Russia
8846 2018-12-21 19:58:09 I thought you were in MLPs, they move oil, they don't make it, haha
8847 2018-12-21 19:58:05 TExas got Mitch to do their dirty work and the oil barons and the ranchers caused it in the first place. So now they get to scapegoat. Shale covers a large part of South America and guess who will be digging that up... so the wall was a power play and it will be open for business
8848 2018-12-21 19:57:55 Yet, you are calling on @JustinTrudeau to #socialize #oil and #gas? Wouldn't that cost money? #abpoli #cdnpoli #pipedream #poisonisreal
8849 2018-12-21 19:57:51 You know what this market needs? Some more rate hikes. Nothing says runaway inflation and growth like oil dropping 40% in a month.
8850 2018-12-21 19:57:45 Alberta had robust credit too till the NDP Notley & Ceci economics have provided us with 3 credit downgrades in so many years 
Can't wait to see the real damage from their last budget!!  They based it on oil prices soaring  
I'd laugh but it really isn't funny
8851 2018-12-21 19:57:37 Decades of war to secure western globalist control of middle eastern oil have left more than a million dead, millions more as refugees, 10's of millions more left homeless? And now the 1% media call bringing an end to this rebranded colnialism a grave mistake?
8852 2018-12-21 19:57:31 The Koch brothers seem to be more like a wolf in sheep clothing than authentic libertarians.
8853 2018-12-21 19:57:30 What companies exactly are purchasing their oil?
8854 2018-12-21 19:57:17 Are you fussy about what sort of cake? Big difference between a Victoria sponge a ‘healthy’ cake made with olive oil and honey instead of butter and sugar. 
8855 2018-12-21 19:57:17 Dropped my car off for an oil change I forgot to take my house key :)))
8856 2018-12-21 19:57:12 Interesting....seeing some indications myself.  My oil company's dividend is about to hit 10%.  That is my trigger.
8857 2018-12-21 19:57:09 @realDonaldTrump this is the moment, stop buying oil from Venezuela. Stop supporting that dictatorship.
8858 2018-12-21 19:56:53 Welcome to Canada, where getting bent over every day by Big Oil is a commonality our government does literally nothing about.
And that’s $1.25.9/L btw.
8859 2018-12-21 19:56:49 I usually discover I have an oil change for the car scheduled the day before and I'm never sure if I should risk cancelling.
8860 2018-12-21 19:56:43 Re-curated the national design book project research files and my unfinished design work into a new better physiognomy. All 435.3GB of them. Fresher perspectives two-years hence. Midnight oil fires of the past two weeks end today, 3:56 am. Saturday. Satiated and inspired 
8861 2018-12-21 19:56:41 Maybe you should try the kale tip I saw on facebook - if you cook it in coconut oil it makes it easier to slide out of the pan straight into the bin ;-)
8862 2018-12-21 19:56:16 One day soon one hopes the truth will out and these snake oil salesmen be brought to account for their acts of ill-intent.
8863 2018-12-21 19:56:11 That feeling ordering new oil and various filters for your car 
8864 2018-12-21 19:56:05 If you ain’t putting pure synthetic oil in ya whip then you fuckin up
8865 2018-12-21 19:55:56 Lmao he better pull out that oil
8866 2018-12-21 19:55:53 Indigenous people already know the truth about these ruling classes. We’re victims of it globally. We don’t hear enough of our indigenous relatives in Russia being marginalized for oil too. These greedy elites are the same everywhere.
8867 2018-12-21 19:55:53 a small part in akwa ibom, "Oron" provide 80% of the oil, are treated like Nigeria treats niger delta
8868 2018-12-21 19:55:35 So Texas oil and gas barons and the ranchers can take over and play president for a while since they oceaned the stock market
8869 2018-12-21 19:54:44 A Panadol, half Xanax, some pain relief oil and I’m still struggling with this headache.

8872 2018-12-21 19:54:22 Anyone else wondering if the whole #albexit thing is another Russian influence operation like Brexit and the 2016 US election?  Rip open the old East-West, French-English wounds, and keep Canadian oil in the ground?
8873 2018-12-21 19:54:18 Calm down, its even half of the prayer, and you get serious reward from it.
8874 2018-12-21 19:54:08 What a well crafted lie.  Texas is in control. Shale oil technology and Gov Abbott has part of USA military at his beck and call here. Ranchers and oil and gas having way too much influence. All that networking at Bush funeral gave Jr. more status  check who has the Air Force
8875 2018-12-21 19:54:08 They bought a diamond lock
8876 2018-12-21 19:54:05 1) I am curious about whether the ratio of oil from the Permian to the other plays is sustainable. I know you've looked at the numbers Art, so I'm curious if you think the quantity / quality of the resource supports the Permian dwarfing the other plays?
8877 2018-12-21 19:54:05 It means norms of Islam encourage higher reproduction of people with worse genes than of those with better genes and it's one of the major reasons why Islamic nations aren't improving, other than from mentioned they get for oil.
8878 2018-12-21 19:53:50 Happy to see @AndrewScheer making himself visible in Western Canada, coming out to support oil workers. However, if he has any hope of forming the next government, he has to make himself more visible here in the East. We never see him. This is where elections are won. #cdnpoli

8882 2018-12-21 19:53:07 wash face with dove exfoliating soap before going to sleep with hot water to open your pores and put on baby oil/baby night time lotion overnight, then wash face again in the morning with warm water and same soal and use regular baby lotion, i use Johnson&johnson, that's it
8883 2018-12-21 19:52:54 - Sanctioned Russian firms and oligarchs
- Sold lethal weapons to Ukraine
- Pushed Europeans to increase NATO contributions
- Killed Russians in Syria
- Shamed Germany for buying Russian oil
- Promotes US energy independence
- etc.
But Trump loves Russia! RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA!
8884 2018-12-21 19:52:48 I totally get it! Use Some lavender essential oil’s on the bottoms of your feet...off to Lilly bye land you will go
8885 2018-12-21 19:52:46 To a small saucepan, add coconut milk, almond milk, ground turmeric, ground ginger, cinnamon stick, coconut oil, black pepper, and sweetener of choice (I usually add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) maple syrup.. found this on Google
8886 2018-12-21 19:52:44 its a JZ, just assume the oil pressure is low
8887 2018-12-21 19:52:43 I'm sitting at the oil change place and its super busy and they are blasting Christmas songs and everyone is wearing Santa hats and I'm all

8889 2018-12-21 19:52:35 I highly recommend buying CBD isolate. It is a powder that is 99.6% pure CBD. You can take it straight but it does better when added to oil. It is oil soluble but not water soluble. It is easier to dose and get higher amounts of CBD than with straight tinctures.
8890 2018-12-21 19:52:31 In a few months Venezuela will be worse off than we've ever seen. China will try to weasel in to get the oil. The US could annex Venezuela. Rename it... File off the serial numbers.
8891 2018-12-21 19:52:30 Time to shut it rather than expand (new pipelines are 2 expand).

Since Trump/Saudis made a deal to drive down oil prices by increasing Saudi exports (for geopolitical reasons: Iran, Venezuela, Russia) the Tar Sands have been shipping at a loss - with Massive Public Subsidy.

8896 2018-12-21 19:52:03 @silkdynastystx Are u buying oil into the close? Or still waiting?
8897 2018-12-21 19:51:58 Ehhhhh Yemen has massive oil and gas reserves Syria more or less the same still to be tapped

8901 2018-12-21 19:51:37 I finally got a oil change after a month  I’m so proud of myself.
8902 2018-12-21 19:51:32 Oil change real quick

8904 2018-12-21 19:51:27 Cleaned my kitchen, then Immediately knocked over a deep fryer that was full of oil. 10/10 would knock over again.
8905 2018-12-21 19:51:26 I live in a relatively inexpensive locale & this is laughable. You could find cheaper rent, depending on standards,but internet is $50 for the cheapest possible connection, cleaning  more like $100. (Pretty much NOBODY except upper level govt, ed & some oil ppl earn $100K here.)
8906 2018-12-21 19:51:26 Oil prices will be reduced from midnight;

8910 2018-12-21 19:51:14 p.s. think it is still too early to see impact of fall in oil prices in the data.  but would worry that will see a fall off in investment and less employment in related manufacturing in q1 and q2 of 19
8911 2018-12-21 19:51:08 Daaamn an oil change, car wash, & detail really hit different when you’re an adult.

8914 2018-12-21 19:51:02 What % of those ETFs is related to oil E&P?
8915 2018-12-21 19:50:54 I really need some coconut oil
8916 2018-12-21 19:50:47 No, it's not True. Our government framed Saddam so daddy Bush can get his grubby hands on their oil.
8917 2018-12-21 19:50:36 Well that definitely makes sense. Everything comes down to oil and money when it comes to illegal occupation of countries.
8918 2018-12-21 19:50:35 It’s all that oil money lmao 
8919 2018-12-21 19:50:33 We do not want to die for kurds Israel Saudi or oil, understand?
8920 2018-12-21 19:50:25 In 2015, head oil guys voluntarily gave me a lot of information. 
which makes me think the actual cluster fuck shit show we are 
experiencing now is more due to the bankers reluctance to change
& hackers newfound blackmail power. (even if it means the death of everything)
8921 2018-12-21 19:50:17 I take 1000mg cbd oil tablets a day. They do nothing for my pain but do seem to help my neurological muscle spasms.
8922 2018-12-21 19:50:13 "It does." She commented, moving around the room to get everything set up before returning to him and she began to rub the oil onto his back, being gentle this time.

"I shouldn't have done that.."
8923 2018-12-21 19:50:12 The 6% who want Algerian oil must have their minority rights protected you know. (sarcasm)
8924 2018-12-21 19:50:07 2016 on oil had gone from 26 to 77 (WTI) and the Canadian dollar went from .69 to .82.  2hat does that say
8925 2018-12-21 19:50:03 Read the whole piece... I'm more surprised that enviromentalists didn't know who the Dem leadership was than anything @TeamPelosi's up to. Of course they'll kick the can. Just keep the oil cash spigot flowing.
8926 2018-12-21 19:49:58 I need an oil treatment but i only came for an oil change so ima get that and mind my business
8927 2018-12-21 19:49:54 And I have already said each situation is unique and separate. The more resources we can control, the better. That doesn't mean we start a war over every pool of oil, though.
8928 2018-12-21 19:49:48 Well after this weak ass oil change 
8929 2018-12-21 19:49:42 Oh yes, that’s why much resistive heating is now replaced with heat pumps. But my point was, around 1980 when oil was changed to resistive heating, was that good or bad? Good for CO2, bad for efficiency accounting in spreadsheets.
8930 2018-12-21 19:49:30 Thanks for reminding me I need an oil change.
8931 2018-12-21 19:49:19 Don't forget Russia made American oil executives steal land from Native Amerindians to put oil pipelines through their sacred burial sites, then got North Dakota police to shoot peaceful protesters, gas them, attack them w/dogs and strip them naked. Oh and Russia caused Flint..

8934 2018-12-21 19:49:15 you forgot the $1590 a month it would cost to drive from your apartment in cincinnati to your job in DC, the $120/month for weekly oil changes, the lease on your prius to get the gas number that low, and the time-travel fees to make that commute possible.
8935 2018-12-21 19:49:14 Yup the UK did not give up the colonies because there were nice,nor because they were defeated in war but because in an era of capitalism it's cheaper to buy form them than run to rule. And the whole control the oil thing is wrong,because it's a world market and oil is fungible.
8936 2018-12-21 19:49:09 No OIL, No LIFE!!!

8938 2018-12-21 19:49:07 Wacha wivu soma ndugu. People read and juggle. If you yourself hate books there are others like GG Kariuki and Dr. Ruto who burn midnight oil. If you dispute ask the VC UoN.
8939 2018-12-21 19:49:04 It’s high time somalia allowed capable countries her resources for the benefit of the Somali people.If siyad Barre allowed the exploitation of oil and other resources maybe today somalia could have been a different country. The same mistake should not be made again
8940 2018-12-21 19:48:56 They are trying to develop other income streams for when we’ve moved to other types of energy- but that will be a while yet. They are more worried about shale oil undercutting them at present.
8941 2018-12-21 19:48:50 Can we incorporate a moat and big pots on the  wall so we can dump hot oil on people?
8942 2018-12-21 19:48:38 use any type of oil but don't go close to the olive oil
8943 2018-12-21 19:48:15 I will pull the figures on ‘10-‘14 monthly growth but pretty sure it was less than the 25k per month jobs in mfr being added now, and we do have a strong dollar and declining oil prices now as well, so the current growth compares well against both periods.
8944 2018-12-21 19:47:46 $130 for transportation?  Okay, last I checked a monthly Rapid pass was $105, so maybe.  But if the person actually lives someplace where they need to drive a car, $130 doesn't cover gas, insurance, parking, oil change and, oh yeah, CAR PAYMENTS.
8945 2018-12-21 19:47:44 After ardently supporting Liberals under a @JustinTrudeau leadership, I too am having serious misgivings considering his Foreign Policy and dubious trade negotiations, to say nothing of the deaf ear to our oil industry. cc: @RuddKim

8947 2018-12-21 19:47:28 Mattis in charge of keeping wars continuing in Middle East?
Middle East must stop depending on U.S. handouts....Start
bartering with each other....Trade oil for food, medicine, etc.
Not murder families, destroy villages, schools with American weapons....
8948 2018-12-21 19:47:20 Fracking is a method of extracting oil. Refinements  in the process led to American oil boom in 2012 because it allowed us to take advantage of the oil shale deposits throughout the country specifically North Dakota. This is why the price of oil crashed  to $40 after being $145
8949 2018-12-21 19:47:17 Chef Kawasaki cut up some live rats, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with gravy.
8950 2018-12-21 19:47:14 Check out oil after the close. That will help.
8951 2018-12-21 19:47:11 Lol why do you think America "invaded because of oil"? Who got "the oil"? You think they just went over there and raided a warehouse full of "oil (tm)"? Childish foreign policy understanding. Take a look at the oil pipeline from the caspian sea: will find something interesting.
8952 2018-12-21 19:47:11 The only “essential” oil is the oil that is anointed.
8953 2018-12-21 19:47:03 What’s the timeframe on new ATH?
8954 2018-12-21 19:46:52 On the right. 
You see much evidence of research paid for by Big Oil that is published in science papers? 
How about government funded research?
8955 2018-12-21 19:46:36 Here's an easy one: stuffed mushrooms.

Get a couple of large flattish shrooms. Remove the stalks & fill the cup with finely chopped peppers and onions, lightly fried in olive oil. Top with grated cheese and breadcrumbs.Bake in the oven until the topping goes crispy.
8956 2018-12-21 19:46:35 EVERY fucking time i get an oil change & they do a light check, i turn on my fucking windshield wipers instead of my blinker as if i’ve never driven a car in my life jesus CHRIST why am i this way
8957 2018-12-21 19:46:30 Lol. He still works in the oil sector but doesn't go offshore anymore.
8958 2018-12-21 19:46:28 Excuse my ignorance Eugene - “oil stamps” ? What a great customer and human being. Merry Christmas 
8959 2018-12-21 19:46:15 Whoever Told Ghanaian Employers That Christmas Is Celebrated With Rice & Oil Erh 

That Person Won’t Make It To Heaven ooo
8960 2018-12-21 19:46:15 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
8961 2018-12-21 19:46:12 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
8962 2018-12-21 19:45:41 sana oil
8963 2018-12-21 19:45:26 Yeah a committee packed with fossil fuel industry lackeys, I'm sure they will totally come up with the solution. Oh right we can't say they were bought off just because they took money from the oil industry! Yeah we actually can.
8964 2018-12-21 19:45:20 my shit brain: You Are Lazy, Look At You Doing Nothing
me: it's my day off? and also I'm doing laundry AND i got my oil changed AND ran an errand to the post office? um?
my shit brain: L A Z Y....STOP DOING NOTHING....DO MORE THINGS
8965 2018-12-21 19:45:09 Every time I come get an oil change they tell me I need something extra like I already hate spending money on this shit dang
8966 2018-12-21 19:45:08 I have oil for sale
8967 2018-12-21 19:45:08 Midnight Oil - Power And The Passion
8968 2018-12-21 19:44:56 Really excited for thousands of witchy LA hipsters to join their suburban moms and dads in the essential oils MLM movement by peddling the newest oil essential: CBD.
8969 2018-12-21 19:44:52 #US Markets@Afternoon: #WallStreet sees more #BearMarket insinuations, with #NASDAQ -2.30% the tech heavy index, losing most. Durable orders, GDP both came lesser than expected. Oil rigs counted higher; #Crude dips further. #DJIA -1.01% #SP500 -1.27%. Treasuries rise. $GE -3.2%.
8970 2018-12-21 19:44:52 It's literally about selling weapons and selling oil. It's not about American safety. The shit is absurd.
8971 2018-12-21 19:44:51 hello i am sad and will watch to all the boys i've loved before again and then do a castor oil hair mask and re-organize my sock drawer and read. okay. thank you. bye now.
8972 2018-12-21 19:44:50 I work in the "gas/petroleum/energy" sector and I donated to Beto and I guaran-damn-tee I don't represent what my CEO overlords want. This whole "Beto excepted oil money" because people making less than 6 figures donated to his campaign is fucking stupid.
8973 2018-12-21 19:44:45 The hemp oil I made my dog smoke is not calming him down at all
8974 2018-12-21 19:44:26 sooo my oil is leaking..
8975 2018-12-21 19:44:14 On the other hand, the 460K was less than .05% of his total donations: considering how big an employer oil and gas is in Texas (likely to donate), it's most likely regular Joes kicking in their $50, like you or I would do. And your reason for not believing that's the case is...?
8976 2018-12-21 19:44:03 How are the Trump Base doing these days? He sold them snake oil and they bought it.  Please wake up to how he is only lining his pockets, he cares not for you, or anyone other than himself. He is using the office to try to make friends with the rich #TrumpResign
8977 2018-12-21 19:43:57 'House cleaner', $40 for cell and $20 for internet should be the first indicators this graph was made by the person you mention. Family cells are $~150 & net is $~90 w/o cable tv where I live. All utilities $195? HAHAHA my oil ALONE is on the cheapest yearly plan for $220/month.
8978 2018-12-21 19:43:53 Hemp seed oil
8979 2018-12-21 19:43:51 Campaign lie for votes. Just like his mid-term bs about tax cuts for middle class just for votes.  He’s hell bent on bankrupting the country for Putin and the Kochs. Bedfellows in  a pool of oil
8980 2018-12-21 19:43:45 Speaking of train-sets you obviously advocate Alberta oil producers get their own rail cars. But, Howe have Canadian farmers been asking for more grain cars to move their produce. What did you do when you were a part of the Federal cabinet?
8981 2018-12-21 19:43:41 What now? Steel slats with solar panels and numerous shipping pipes for oil and gas running through it?
8982 2018-12-21 19:43:40 Oil companies abandon projects, wells, and workers all the time. What leads you to stand up for the mechanical objectives of the bottom line, and ignore the fact that #oil and #gas is a fickle industry? #abpoli #cdnpoli #pipedream #poisonisreal

8984 2018-12-21 19:43:34 So... green activists take money from American oil companies to block pipelines in Canada... isn’t that the pot calling the kettle black
8985 2018-12-21 19:43:24 Perfumes in beard oil can be soothing. 

For some odd reason.
8986 2018-12-21 19:43:11 DT.  All companies in west Texas and New Mexico are hiring with great benefits and moving expenses.  Oil and gas.  Equipment.  Trucking.  Diesel mechanics can name their prices!
8987 2018-12-21 19:43:08 It’s good seeing businesses use social media to market their business... 
& to think a lot of people told me it would never happen in the Oil & Gas Pipeline Industry... 
That’s why I created Macadelic Media

8989 2018-12-21 19:42:51 Did you know that in California the state and federal government make  more money per gallon of fuel  than oil companies.  You miss the point that corps don’t just pay more taxes.  They raise their prices and you and I get to pay.  What is criminal is what Govt does with the $
8990 2018-12-21 19:42:35 Tea Tree Oil. Or Coconut oil (not recommended for oily skin or scalp).
8991 2018-12-21 19:42:31 Tranny back in. Just gotta my starter, battery, intake and a few more things together... and fill the tranny with oil
8992 2018-12-21 19:42:28 You better be. Don't forget the lubrication oil though!
8993 2018-12-21 19:42:17 of course my car would take the most expensive fuckin oil, $144 oil change bruh 
8994 2018-12-21 19:41:58 Robbie is off today so I asked him to come pick up my car while I work and take it to get an oil change thinking that was gonna be a hard no but he did
8995 2018-12-21 19:41:56 Cashiering at the grocery store just felt like someone pissing motor oil on my brain cells for 6 hours while I stared at the clock and got verbally abused by community members
8996 2018-12-21 19:41:54 Marriage without sex? That’s like running a car without oil.
8997 2018-12-21 19:41:43 Coconut oil
8998 2018-12-21 19:41:38 The VP should have seen the type of market that Warri calls Main Market in the heart of Oil producing Area like Warri. Big big shame again and again.
I am beginning to hate politics in Nigeria, where honourable men are enmeshed in murky dirty lying water.
8999 2018-12-21 19:41:29 I don’t know if any of y’all ever look at the stock market but crude oil is down to $45.53 a barrel
9000 2018-12-21 19:41:23 Then quit using all oil products and byproducts.
9001 2018-12-21 19:41:17 well given what the fuck it is oil is doing right now spooz could flash crash to 2400 into close and it wouldn't surprise me.
9002 2018-12-21 19:41:16  yauwa your head get oil
9003 2018-12-21 19:41:10 Brilliant!! There’s a new show called “can’t retire, won’t retire.” A cookery based snooker show hosted by Rory McLeod. They pour olive oil on the tables and have guests who are working into their 70’s. In all different sectors.
9004 2018-12-21 19:40:57 I was all in for Beto, saw his voting record. Voted with GOP over 30% of time on some ACA, Clinate and Oil legislation. Against Cruz he’s a star but comapared to other Dems. maybe not. 

Just sayin’ resistors look at his record and past all the hype. Need to learn more.
9005 2018-12-21 19:40:55 ily too!! argan oil, rose hip seed oil, essence tinted brow gel and minimal plucking !! 
9006 2018-12-21 19:40:45 It's a factor but "oil money" is where the focus will be. If there's anyone left to focus.
9007 2018-12-21 19:40:41 Except the data Sirota used to claim "oil companies" didn't even separate out various energy companies. Utilities, wind, solar, and others were all lumped in.
9008 2018-12-21 19:40:39 To paraphrase Gil Scott Heron,
‘Afraid of shoeless undernourished Guatemalans

Just how blind will America be?’
9009 2018-12-21 19:40:30 The worst Christmas ever... unfortunately work just hasn't been there. Oil Sands fell through, maybe time to head to home & Log #SoSorrySons
9010 2018-12-21 19:40:09 Which sanctions? Country negotiate freely with Rusia, China, Cuba, Bolivia, and many others. US is the major oil customer. Which  sanctions?
9011 2018-12-21 19:40:07 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
9012 2018-12-21 19:40:04 Use macadamia oil I swear by it !!
9013 2018-12-21 19:40:03 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
9014 2018-12-21 19:40:00 They getting yo oil from buttfuck Egypt
9015 2018-12-21 19:39:45 karway oil ne bheja fry kr diya

9017 2018-12-21 19:39:42 The Taliban was *literally* funded by the CIA to purge and kill leftists (the Democratic Marxist federation, however problematic, provided education and housing and women's liberation)

What we don't like about Taliban is they're not giving up the oil
9018 2018-12-21 19:39:39 Which is why comments like McGuire's are so terrible. Also, the examples he gave were far from accurate. Yes, all those teams have dabbled in them but so did the vast majority of others, including all of the league's recent Cup winners.
9019 2018-12-21 19:39:33 The reason I believe in pseudo science is it allows me to do whatever I  like as long as I remember to take two drops of cbd oil a day.#lifecoach
9020 2018-12-21 19:39:31 How and what has trump sold out to Putin? You are quite mistaken. Trump has been stronger on Russia than his predecessors. Strengthening nato, producing oil, advocating for Germany not to be dependent on Russian oil.
9021 2018-12-21 19:39:30 Allow me to clarify: find me a job posting for an entry level position (meaning NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED) paying $100k per year in the ND oil industry. 

I’ll wait.
9022 2018-12-21 19:39:12 Aw man that’s horrible, I’ll try that oil see if it helps me any x
9023 2018-12-21 19:39:05 @McNeil_Parkins was just listening to you guys convo about “smoking” listen that vape oil is amazing and probably saved my marriage, because the “smell” is gone, now everyone is happy 
9024 2018-12-21 19:39:03 Because in those days Christmas *was* in July due to the extension of British Summer Time because of the oil crisis of the time
9025 2018-12-21 19:38:55 It has a low smoking point so I'd say a good old veg or sunflower oil is best to make sure you don't smoke out your kitchen.
9026 2018-12-21 19:38:55 The open secrets data seemed unreliable as far as which employers are in the oil and gas industry.  The list had people who said their occupation was "retired" and "homemaker" for example. How did Open secrets classify those as coming from oil and gas industry?
9027 2018-12-21 19:38:53 Types of problems due to the infrastructure deficit in this country. No light, water, no roads.., we cannot even refine the “crude oil” we have. The government of @MBuhari is working tirelessly to address these 16 years we lost due to #atikulooters and there party’s senselessness
9028 2018-12-21 19:38:50 Oil is starting to climb
9029 2018-12-21 19:38:49 In other words, yes we can restrict oil money recipients if we choose to, and nothing requires us to include them. Does that make sense?
9030 2018-12-21 19:38:48 Skincare friends--

Do you have a favorite facial oil?

(Not fragranced/no essential oils please)
9031 2018-12-21 19:38:44 The only people I know close to this are construction or oil field workers who work 12 hour days, get 1.5x overtime pay, and live in man-camps.
9032 2018-12-21 19:38:38 Internet $20? Rent $850? I’m not sure where the hell you think this is
9033 2018-12-21 19:38:22 File, Clean your nails & hands with lemon juice. Soak your fingertips in warm olive oil 10 minutes. Then, use your own polish at home :)
9034 2018-12-21 19:38:20 Sadly Ernie is paying for my oil change, shoes & last nights dinner 
9035 2018-12-21 19:38:19 Non-centralized power will be more secure, sustainable, get us away from bad oil players internationally & locally, and improve our environment in a multitude of ways.

It’s already getting close to the cost of a new heater.
9036 2018-12-21 19:38:14 Forget, jifa baizo kanka bane , I paid 160k fr my 2 sis
9037 2018-12-21 19:38:12 It’s about to be 7. I been taking NyQuil everynight i got an oil diffuser full of eucalyptus and rosemary it seems to be the worst at night
9038 2018-12-21 19:38:04 2 hours for an oil change. This why I don’t do this shit. I miss my dad lol
9039 2018-12-21 19:38:01 Well, Ryan was talking about the absurdity of the first amendment argument against restricting oil money, and I was concurring with that. Yes, we can do what we want and we don’t need a reason and 1A has nothing to do with it.
9040 2018-12-21 19:37:55 When you take your car to get an oil change and it's done in less than 30 min  thanks @Kia
9041 2018-12-21 19:37:54 does cbd oil work
9042 2018-12-21 19:37:43 - Oliver?
- Да, Oli
- Я буду звать его Oil. Ну чё, масло, давай
9043 2018-12-21 19:37:37 I think I’ll try and practice at the weekend. Is olive oil acceptable or so I need something else?
9044 2018-12-21 19:37:18 $OIH was well above $20 in 2009 (WTI low $34) and 2016 (WTI low $26). The ceasing of oil & gas production is beginning to be priced in with the seize up of civilization next year.
9045 2018-12-21 19:36:48 really in this game no bootm no top exist. we may talk 100 dollars oil again in 2019 or we may see another 18 dollars oil regardless inflation. Those values are in range.
9046 2018-12-21 19:36:47 With the immersion cooling if you can get oil inlet temps at 20C you can get a chip temp of 60C which allows overclocking of each miner. Using a wet cooling tower in Central America you can get an oil temp of 35C
9047 2018-12-21 19:36:40 Yes, oil futures & EV's are key to when that tipping point occurs. China EV shock will destabilize not just oil demand but pol econ of Global trade as Auto supply-chain investment in the 3 manuf powerhouses (NAFTA; Ger/C Europe; Japan/E Asia) turns to #strandedassets. Buckle up!
9048 2018-12-21 19:36:37 And do some oil treatment
9049 2018-12-21 19:36:34 南がしっかりせんと前線がかなり下がるからやめて欲しいんだがな
9050 2018-12-21 19:36:31 I do change my oil
9051 2018-12-21 19:36:20 Had to get me a oil change
9052 2018-12-21 19:36:14 The only one headed the way of the dodo bird is you, oil demand is on the rise worldwide and will continue for several decades by the most conservative of estimates.
9053 2018-12-21 19:36:11 Could be said before dimms abandoned heartland working Americans. Most parroting this line never really understood who they really were or their true ideological beliefs. 
They are not partial to either party, just globalist ideologues
9054 2018-12-21 19:36:07 Bring our boys home! Only DC elites are for eternal war in the Middle East. Why do we care about the Middle East? We have plenty of oil now. Why is Iran our enemy and Saudi Arabia our ally? How many trillions of dollars and thousands of death for neocon goals will wake DC up?
9055 2018-12-21 19:36:06 Fastest growing economy?  Since delaying operations in Syria, could
please work with PM Madhi exchange OIL for water from your DAM
for the dying and salty waters in No. IRAQ?  The water buffalo are dying...
Please help....I cannot sleep when animals are dying over politics..!
9056 2018-12-21 19:36:03 Great idea. Leave us alone. We can have a new nation with out the jackboots of the left on our throats. We will fund our nation with toll roads, selling oil, coal fired energy and food.
9057 2018-12-21 19:36:01 As everyone else had said. Let the better rest and very hot oil/fat. Also don't open the oven door once they're in until you think they're done, as all the heat will escape and they'll sink
9058 2018-12-21 19:35:52 Look how long WoW a mek oil and them thing deh. Them upgrade
9059 2018-12-21 19:35:40 Oil won't really press n defend properly, it's just part of his being and style
9060 2018-12-21 19:35:38 Good job @realDonaldTrump. Now, if we could pull troops from other places where we have troops serving the interest of big oil, that would be great. Let's put that money toward alternative fuels, renewable resources, energy independence and infrustructure.

9065 2018-12-21 19:35:05 The only reason why we're there to begin with was to clear the way for Saudi Arabia to lay pipelines between it an Europe, weening Europe off it's dependence of Russian oil/natural gas. Doing this would collapse Russia's economy, which is why they intervened.

9067 2018-12-21 19:34:53 bakersfield friends! would anyone be interested in a little open house essential oil party if i hosted one?? i know it’s busy around the holidays so you would be able to go and come throughout the day whenever works for you to come sample & learn about safe essential oils use!!
9068 2018-12-21 19:34:48 It may help a little but not as effectively as the CBD from cannabis. I would still try it. I’ve used some hemp CBD products that had other ingredients like menthol and camphor that helped, and copaiba essential oil has cannabanoid properties so it helps a tiny bit.
9069 2018-12-21 19:34:47 Nah, brah. You made the claim which means you must provide the evidence. Find me an entry level job listing in the oil industry in ND that pays $100k year. I’ll even take before taxes. 

I’ll wait.
9070 2018-12-21 19:34:42 Basic/primary needs: rice, turkey, vegetable oil and maybe small cash. Depending on your budget.
9071 2018-12-21 19:34:31 The only people I’ve ever known that are anywhere close to this graph are workers on oil fields who work 12 hour days and live in man-camps.
9072 2018-12-21 19:34:23 Hey Tina, how can you tell that bae is officially on winter break? Hmm maybe all the nudity and joints and giggling and mischievously spraying me with Murphy's Oil Soap...
9073 2018-12-21 19:34:19 Top 2 country's on your list have resource's of Iron Ore, Uranium, petroleum,

9074 2018-12-21 19:34:16 You prefer to continue to Occupy Syria? 
You prefer never-ending War?

Corrupt. Evil. 
CIA created ISIS to destabilize Syria 
Grab control of oil and gas distribution for Banksters. 
Russia destroyed ISIS. 
Trump just got out of the way. 
BRAVO!
9075 2018-12-21 19:34:15 I think somebody needs a Christmas-stress hot oil massage.
9076 2018-12-21 19:33:54 We get into these messes on behalf of the oil companies and other conglomerates, and then have to stay for humanitarian purposes. What brilliant fucking foreign policy!
9077 2018-12-21 19:33:53 Nothing like changing truck oil for some father-son bonding, I’ll tell you what
9078 2018-12-21 19:33:43 So, somehow, I tweet I made to @ryangrim laughing at the absurdity of claiming the first amendment prevents Dems from banning oil money recipients from serving on committees got interpreted exactly the other way. Not what I wanted, so I deleted the original confusing tweet.
9079 2018-12-21 19:33:37 “The oil industry brought campaign cash, PR savvy and climate denial strategy” and InsideClimate is bought and paid for propaganda for climate alarmism.  Purely political operatives. Pot calling kettle black. Wake up people
9080 2018-12-21 19:33:36 The Leafs are an organization that run on said mindset and it's the way every organization should be run.
9081 2018-12-21 19:33:35 Yes, timing & order.  US has run $200B deficits 2 of last 4 mths.  In at least 1 of those mths, true interest expense was >100% of tax receipts.  Falling stocks & falling oil will make this much worse, rapidly.
9082 2018-12-21 19:33:34 This gives them hegemony over fungible energy, which the first world needs (needed). The key, IMHO, to make this irrelevant is to grow and expand Tesla to make oil useless. But alas, our US government seems hell bent on preventing that.
9083 2018-12-21 19:33:27 Good move! We can't be involved with mass killings! I know there's oil there but it not ours and we need clean energy to protect our environment. Our boys aren't referees. We should have never invaded. These Afghan  people have their own culture and weren't directly involved 911.
9084 2018-12-21 19:33:13 Wow Hott gagging to taste your hole sexy package, love the swell wet look covered up in oil and cum  xx 
9085 2018-12-21 19:33:10 All the Oil major companies operating in Nigeria has been Directed by the Federal and State Government of Nigeria to relocate their Head Quarters to the Niger Delta Region,  failure is as a disobedient to the Federal and State Government directive / policy.
9086 2018-12-21 19:33:05 K so have no clue how but just got fryer oil in my mouth and if I ever need to torture someone, this is the exact method im choosing
9087 2018-12-21 19:33:04 Unless you’re working 70 hour weeks in the West Texas oil fields or something
9088 2018-12-21 19:33:04 Did you just promise a trade war with @realDonaldTrump by blocking US Energy Exports? "We'll get rid of foreign oil coming into Canada and replace it with Western Canadian Energy" - @AndrewScheer
9089 2018-12-21 19:33:02 For me, it's less about finding hidden gems and more about putting the best players in place to help your team win games. Be it via analytics or scouting, there will always be finds and misses. There is no perfect solution but a marriage of the two is the only way it'll work.
9090 2018-12-21 19:32:59 What no 5 billion dollar wall? When our infrastructure is in desperate need  bridges dams, etc ok let’s go green and stop@oil imports Donald

9095 2018-12-21 19:32:40 Are you using cannabis oil too ?? X
9096 2018-12-21 19:32:39 It’s awful :( I’ve get CBT oil for it now and its helping but I’m still in pain! On sleeping medication too and day medication@x
9097 2018-12-21 19:32:38 Having a pretty face saves you $20 on an oil change 
9098 2018-12-21 19:32:35 Love Midnight Oil.
9099 2018-12-21 19:32:31 I love the smell of tea tree oil 
9100 2018-12-21 19:32:14 I made the children some playdo. 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of salt,2 cups of water, 1 tablespoon of oil and 1 tablespoon of cream of tartar. (This makes a lot!) Then I added some googly eyes, matchsticks and pipecleaners for the accessories. 
9101 2018-12-21 19:32:10 Yeah seriously this never happened to me until I got a new car  me n my sis oil changes are this mhch. I’m use to paying like 30$
9102 2018-12-21 19:32:04 The issue is oil. Russia and SA are two of the biggest oil producers in the world. Russia in Syria and Iran, and the lack of an Iraq buffer puts in direct contact (so to speak) with SA. Unlikely to see a direct invasion, I suspect a Russia-SA oil bloc.
9103 2018-12-21 19:32:03 Doesn't Alberta want jobs and sustainability? Or continued job losses with no plans for sustaining their new national economy when oil prices collapse?
9104 2018-12-21 19:31:41 The Smartest thing Indy did for the Super Bowl was making sure you never had to actually go through the 65/70 split to get to Lucas Oil from the Airport.
9105 2018-12-21 19:31:37 Honestly I forgot how damn GOOD the argon oil shampoo & conditioner is from Poundland !!!
9106 2018-12-21 19:31:36 I agree breakeven is irrelevant. However:
  10     oil price
- 5      Opex 
-1.5     Legacy Decline 
+0       Prod Growth 
=3.5

I think your statement says the above math = 5 as it ignores legacy decline.
9107 2018-12-21 19:31:24 Citation needed. Because man it's bad news for earning money, when oil, coal and deregulation is way more profitable.
9108 2018-12-21 19:31:21 When you got to get your oil changed and find out that its free today and you have 3 more free oil changes left!  #illtakeit
9109 2018-12-21 19:31:18 dwh really makes me think that the worse form of escaping from an emergency situation in rig is jumping to the sea full of oil and fire. and that'll be me+2things i hate the most. oh and death.
9110 2018-12-21 19:31:15 "our oil" is under "our feet".  It sure is not in Saud's sandbox. 

Let's cause and effect the waste of the DOD, amortized, and see if the numbers match.
The US is our grandparents' dreams, made real. We will awake from it, by necessity. Face the morning or...
9111 2018-12-21 19:31:13 Took my 5-year-old, 70K mile car in for an oil change, and the mechanic said my car is in great shape! Why, thank you Mr. Mechanic. I try to make sure I maintain my car, that I bought all by myself :)
9112 2018-12-21 19:31:06 Oooh okay. That makes sense. So, this hemp oil w/ 3% CBD is more of a dietary supplement than an analgesic? BTW—this small bottle was $40! I didn’t buy it, my BIL gave it to me. Seems expensive.
9113 2018-12-21 19:30:50 Castor would have to recuse if she were using oil & gas $ as a metric. She's taken $73k herself, and not just individual donations. $60k came from corp PACs. She's #owned.

9118 2018-12-21 19:30:22 WHO TF GOT OIL CARTS
9119 2018-12-21 19:30:19 we need Siege Platforms, Catapults, Burning Oil and all the most advanced technologies fron the 9th Century. #TrumpShutdown

9123 2018-12-21 19:29:54 You do make me laugh. For what it's worth, I once spent £50 on a 'olde oil painting' of a dog walking under a lamp post. My Becci took one look, scratched it several times and declared it 'an effing print done on a poxy dot matrix printer'. Looked ok to me :(
9124 2018-12-21 19:29:45 we are not better today. I think we where better two years ago because two years ago we can buy stuffs for our self but today this Christmas is dry to the extent that we can't buy a bag of Rice, Cooking Oil, Tomatoes, Fowls etc. Mr Kwesi Twum CEO of Multimedia #GhanaConnet
9125 2018-12-21 19:29:40 I disagree with the decision personally. As I said, my tweet was based on the fact that it’s not a first amendment violation to ban members who take oil money.
9126 2018-12-21 19:29:38 my theory is oil engineer in bumfuck nowhere texas
9127 2018-12-21 19:29:38 Good luck trying to get a teaching job by saying you’re qualified just because you finished that level of school. That doesn’t happen anywhere, nor should it. That’s like me claiming to be a mechanic because I changed my oil once or twice.
9128 2018-12-21 19:29:28 I mean, even COSIA (Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance) is taking care of the impacts of climate change in order to correctly restore forests on reclamation lands.

9130 2018-12-21 19:29:24 The only government in the world that can lose money on oil and marijuana sales. Unfucking believable.
9131 2018-12-21 19:29:19 Much more than a few part time jobs. I get the feeling you’re east of Alberta. I think we should stop sending Canada equalization payments. If you don’t want the oil you must not want the money. Your debit card shouldn’t work at the gas pump if you post anti oil on social media.
9132 2018-12-21 19:29:18 Are you going to pledge not to take money from big oil then?
9133 2018-12-21 19:29:17 Very tempted to be irresponsible rn and go to Target and buy things I don’t need. But I think I’m gonna go to the bank and then get my oil changed instead bc that’s what adults do or something.
9134 2018-12-21 19:29:06 i remembered to take my cbd oil today and yesterday :)
9135 2018-12-21 19:29:03 I tried to work at the oil and vinegar store on the plaza and they wouldn’t even respond to my emails 
9136 2018-12-21 19:28:46 i lose my hair from thyroid disease and have tried so many things but making coffee oil was the only thing i noticed results from
9137 2018-12-21 19:28:34 Oil Crooks strike again; look at what they did in 3 minutes
9138 2018-12-21 19:28:33 The point is still that it supposes he will vote in the interests of Oil and Gas companies which are destroying all life on earth and creating a climate crisis. Good work by Sirota who takes this problem seriously
9139 2018-12-21 19:28:07 One could just dose with an oil and leave behind all the unnecessary additional ingredients and calories.

Mum: “well, in order to get butter you have to squeeze a cow!”
9142 2018-12-21 19:27:51 I call Bullshit on all of this.  Where is rent $825?  And that transportation cost is fine if you don't have car insurance, need gas or require any maintenance(like oil changes, tires...etc).  Internet for $20?  Sign me up!  I could go on and on....
9143 2018-12-21 19:27:49 Ugly Blondes - Oil and Wine
9144 2018-12-21 19:27:47 I hate getting oil changes
9145 2018-12-21 19:27:45 Yeah it'd be really great to have a guy like Beto in the Senate for few remaining years our planet is habitable for human life. I'm sure the oil companies will appreciate it!
9146 2018-12-21 19:27:35 done: chocolate chip cookies, oatmeal raisin, bread

to make: peppermint meringue cookies, orange olive oil cake, more bread
9147 2018-12-21 19:27:33 President Trump, I've been behind you til now.  And now you are beginning to screw up.  I know you don't give a damn, but I don't agree with the pull out in Syria or your meddling in markets especially oil.  Let the markets work!  I'm retired on fixed and have suffered 4 years!
9148 2018-12-21 19:27:08 Your article is six years old. These comments are from this year. Between six years ago and now, the shale oil industry in ND collapsed and now those jobs pay less than half what they did. 

Details matter. Facts matter. Truth matters.
9149 2018-12-21 19:27:02 Then why do you politicize when the oil prices go up with respect crude prices. When you bash them when prices go up, give them credit when they come down. You can’t have both ways.
9150 2018-12-21 19:26:44 too bad the democrats are all paid by the same oil and weapons corporations and are just going to say you're an assadist who wants kurds to die 
because the whole world needs to be occupied by the US military forever, I guess
9151 2018-12-21 19:26:41 They alternate, sometimes they use crude oil, sometimes they use blood from EJ communities. #OutOfTouch #OilMoneyOut
9152 2018-12-21 19:26:37 I’m overdue for an oil change. I can’t do Blue Ivy like I did Becky

9154 2018-12-21 19:26:26 i love argan oil!
9155 2018-12-21 19:26:21 I appreciate you guys wanting to expedite me vomiting but I'll just wait it out instead of forcing it to happen with fizzy motor oil
9156 2018-12-21 19:26:20 I don;t disagree with that..  But: 1) she lied to them and then did a 180; 2) she COULD have done climate and gun legislation in 2009 when they controlled all three branches, but didn't, so there goes your argument in her defense.  She had no intention of going against big oil.
9157 2018-12-21 19:26:16 Don't forget he put a Marine Protected Area over top of what is suspected to be tens of billions of barrels of oil in Landcaster Sound. This government is trying to permanently shut down oil and gas in Canada.
9158 2018-12-21 19:26:12 Bread,Milk and heating oil after working 63.95681 hours a week.. happy new year and merry Christmas to the shitty govt
9159 2018-12-21 19:26:08 Do u expect the same scenario in oil Mr. Valletutti? Nice bounce today from 45. short term bottom in place?
9160 2018-12-21 19:26:07 Glowing skin: Massage your face daily at night with almond oil and honey mixture and wash it with cold water after few minutes.
9161 2018-12-21 19:25:52 Yes, we hate to see our own citizens get killed for the benefit of oil companies. And you?
9162 2018-12-21 19:25:31 striking to me that even with oil boom and associated demand for manufactures of inputs into oil investment still a long way from pre-great recession levels.
9163 2018-12-21 19:25:24 My day is interesting, something it hasn't been over the past few days, and I'm finally starting my day by taking hemp oil. 
9164 2018-12-21 19:25:02 There's NOTHING cheaper than oil and natural gas.
9165 2018-12-21 19:24:53 Only way CBD would,per my dr, is if not 100% pure. Said may b a trace of thc which because he put me on oil, would ignore.

9167 2018-12-21 19:24:37 I’ve felt ‘Win’ ‘Win’ for a while.  My thoughts were during these early development days when one is on a flat patch because of low activity perhaps the other will have something going on and give reason for cheer. I still think SS accumulation of licence area is the masterstroke
9168 2018-12-21 19:24:33 This hoax economist (mihir) masquarending as journalist was predicting oil and inr, which have fallen flat in just one month, is giving gyan on economics, which clearly is not his forte.

He think 10% inflation, 4.9%+ fiscal def and 12lacs cr npa is good legacy by UPA.
9169 2018-12-21 19:24:27 It looks more like cooking oil
9170 2018-12-21 19:24:20 Irbil better double down on fortifications. Many Amer oil companies will have a lot to lose.

Belcalis! You did not have to do us like that @iamcardib
9173 2018-12-21 19:24:04 Also I felt like a witch when I was using goodies out of the garden to make myself beautiful. I used beet juice in a home made lip gloss with olive oil, cocoa butter, and vaseline. It was a real pretty shine BUT it turned foul outside of the fridge! I just threw them all away
9174 2018-12-21 19:23:58 friendly reminder with the new Lush store opening in St John's: they are AGAINST the #transmountainpipeline, saying it will "inevitably" spill oil into the ocean (that hasn't happened in *60* years) they are RUINING Canada's chance for more jobs and a better economy 
9175 2018-12-21 19:23:58 At d end of 3qtr of 2018, Fed. Govt's actualaggregate revenue was N2.84trn, 40%higher than 2017 This includes:Oil Revenue of N1.5trn 10% higher than 2017);Company Income Tax of N500.37 billion 23%higher than 2017);
9176 2018-12-21 19:23:55 Perhaps cook outdoors in peanut oil & it will give you new outlook in taste of turkey. Try not to burn yourself or house down. Cook away from house & research carefully. You'll never eat another way again!#run1.com
9177 2018-12-21 19:23:49 And oil was more valuable when Harpoon was in office.
9178 2018-12-21 19:23:47 ‘This blog explores the complex problem of palm oil, arguing that switching to ‘sustainable’ palm oil, approved by certification bodies with robust requirements, may be preferable to boycotting it altogether.’
9179 2018-12-21 19:23:46 You gonna respond to my point? What’s your plan for the oil execs that will definitely get in the way of your tax plan?
9180 2018-12-21 19:23:43 The way I look at it Guy is #lithium #cobalt #graphene = the new OIL, the new ENERGY right?  If that is the case, look at the historicals charts of all the canadian oil companies.  Within 2-7 years they were at 10$ lets say, then lots went up to 30$, 40$, 50$.  So if we get 10$
9181 2018-12-21 19:23:34 what crazy? crazy was a horrible trade, unsecure border, funding, and arming ISIS. a 17-year oil war, and regulations that ran our jobs out of the country.
9182 2018-12-21 19:23:33 Tough to do that when they keep subsidizing oil and pipelines.
9183 2018-12-21 19:23:20 Let them kill each other then we will go in and get the oil
9184 2018-12-21 19:23:20 You are starting to use "weasel" words: "a lot", "little". I can't argue against nonspecific 'non-quantities'.
How much oil do we import?  How much oil does the military use? 
Much like income taxes: income tax revenue (oil) is matched by interest on debt (mil use).
9185 2018-12-21 19:23:19 I'm betting it is to take Trump out, which will cripple the govt, since there are few leaders left.  Then a few cyberattacks on grid and banking and we'll be at his mercy since we're selling off our oil supplies. 
But we should be able to eat soybeans,  we have an abundance
9186 2018-12-21 19:23:16 Today's solstice essential oil blend that I have diffusing: 2 drops of pine, 1 drop balsam fir, 1 drop of peppermint, 2 drops of orange.
9187 2018-12-21 19:23:15 If you believe that I have a war in Iraq that paid for itself in oil revenues to sell you.
9188 2018-12-21 19:23:14 Oil and gas is 40% of the AB economy. Canada's pipeline earns money 24/7 thanks to PMJT.   The feds aren't trying to "phase it out." Geez. Hey if u believe that bs I've got swamp land in the mountains you may be interested in.
9189 2018-12-21 19:23:07 @ Americans 1/ Have you realized that your Army navy air force really   are neither patriot nor Americans? They planned executed genocide of   9/11 now all over the natural resource rich areas of world or geo   -strategically 
significant areas such as oil rich ME Africa,

9191 2018-12-21 19:23:02 I have a bad habit of leaving my car at the dealership while I’m getting an oil change
9192 2018-12-21 19:23:01 If you kill an oil company executive you should be able to plead self-defense.
9193 2018-12-21 19:22:59 If you don’t smoke oil on low temp get away from me freak
9194 2018-12-21 19:22:29 BREAKING: MN governor says Line 3 pipeline is not needed in Minnesota because the oil goes somewhere else. We bear the risk for Enbridge’s profit margin. Get off our land! #StopLine3
9195 2018-12-21 19:22:23 hahaha aww poor Steve..
My daughter called me from university for my Brussel sprouts recipe...LOL  she didn't believe the secret was just olive oil & steak spice..I cook baby potatoes the same way...no lie...a bunch of university students were planning Brussel sprouts into a meal
9196 2018-12-21 19:22:09 Agreed. I'm confident that if Quebecers (& all Cdns) were educated as to what O&G means to Canada (GDP; revenue, jobs; social services, eqaualization, etc); & what advantages using Cdn oil vs foreign oil provides; a proactive & supportive Govt coiuld get pipelines built quickly.
9197 2018-12-21 19:22:06 I was done with your troll responses if you’d like to debate this logically I’m here, and yes I understand thats how the government gets money, did you forget about the oil executives who pay even more to make sure such projects don’t even start?
9198 2018-12-21 19:21:55 If you're trying to get big picture from left of center today, it's #sad. Both Dems and gop love foregn wars, think the oil industry needs free speech protection, and anyone asking for a change from forty years of late stage capitalism is labeled an ally of trump. #normalcountry
9199 2018-12-21 19:21:40 Ha ha - not blaming POTUS for every ailment you know that BUT he really did mispeak, mislead probably all unintnentional on oil and Iran - that is the discussion I am not partisan at all - acknowledge what is good and bad and open minded - I get the disruption tactics but ...
9200 2018-12-21 19:21:20 Hey Rob, it's our addiction not Albertas. The west isn't forcing oil on anyone...we're demanding it. Keep swilling Saudi oil...hope that satisfies your moral outrage.
9201 2018-12-21 19:21:16 Beto is an opportunist and media sponge. He voted for more Republican legislation than most Dems. He is one of the top ten recipients of oil and gas money across BOTH parties. Don’t be such a sucker.
9202 2018-12-21 19:21:16 @tyschmit our fathers sound pretty similar. I put on a tribe called quest when we were driving through Indianoplis this summer and that CD may still be on the side of the highway that overlooks Lucas Oil Staidum
9203 2018-12-21 19:21:06 The only thing that CPC cares about is AB oil, but only when the federal gov’t is Liberal & oil is in the doldrums otherwise they could care less about any part of the country as long as the rich are getting richer & paying less taxes & wages are low.
9204 2018-12-21 19:20:54 Good for you.  The cheap oil going south is horrible for the environment and shipping by rail is dangerous.
9205 2018-12-21 19:20:51 Another day in paradise cars knocking hard and has low oil pressure woohoo
9206 2018-12-21 19:20:48 I’m coming for everyone today. But I’ll be back about to do this essential oil bath!
9207 2018-12-21 19:20:24 Then demand for the dollar will drop and it will lose value. Like I said the only thing that makes the dollar so attractive is OPEC only accepting USD for Oil/Gas. With Americas huge debt not only at government level but at public level the currecy will weaken leading to OPEC
9208 2018-12-21 19:20:15 Since Tuko's surgery, we haven't been able to bathe him. We also forgot to bathe him before the surgery. So basically, I have used so much lavender oil on him that I think he is now immune.
9209 2018-12-21 19:20:05 My question was how man support the fund,  but at the same time do not support oil and gas development.
9210 2018-12-21 19:20:04 Who needs a limited slip diff for a S4 FC. I got one with metal in the oil chilling in my garage. Offer literally anything

9212 2018-12-21 19:19:45 The current staff is still getting their sea legs, and Pruitt is selling snake oil until he establishes a track record as a HC. Not saying they wont accomplish something in a couple of years, but seems like a big risk when he was in a great situation at UM.

9214 2018-12-21 19:19:32 I had an interesting conversation with a Chinese man who thought I was 21 until I told him my age. The highlight was that he applied for some tender in our Oil Sector and he was confident he was going to get it tomorrow. The kicker is that his company is not even registered.
9215 2018-12-21 19:19:19 Send them to Venezuela. Russia is taking control of that failed socialist experiment. Where they have the most proven oil reserves on the planet. Trust me, we don't want Russia in control of that right in out back yard. So please @realDonaldTrump do something about it.

9224 2018-12-21 19:18:37 I've said it before, but I feel the need to say it again. If all you're dressing your sandwich with is mayo and mustard, you've got a 30% sandwich. Splash a few drops of red wine vinegar, a few drops of olive oil, dab some salt and pepper, and sprinkle some oregano.

9234 2018-12-21 19:17:57 Foreign policy is not something you can be thrust into past the age of forty. Harrison and Haley were criminally inept at their jobs. Meanwhile Madeleine Albright had a PhD. Perry previously being Gov of a large oil state, wasn't a significant prerequisite for his job. (1/2).
9235 2018-12-21 19:17:57 Being oil independant for first time in 75 years doesn't hurt either.

What is still under debate is its origins, ratio to biogenic petroleum, & economic quantities for recovery. The hypothesis sees hydrocarbons present in Earth's formation developed into abiogenic oil.

9243 2018-12-21 19:17:09 Yes, but they live on oil rigs and on the road, not in an $825/mo. apartment. You make sacrifices. And I’d like to see anyone show that they cleared more than $100k.
9244 2018-12-21 19:17:02 iirc Chinese oil investments were solely in Sudan c. 2000. As of 2009 in over 20 countries. The Chinese, in some cases, bought 99 years of future supply at spot price in exchange for money and infrastructure projects like this one. Pushed many multinationals out

9254 2018-12-21 19:15:38 Yes it does matter. A manager for an oil firm doesn’t represent that firm with their donations. And Beto can’t say no to indicidual donations. Millions work in that field
9255 2018-12-21 19:15:37 The pollution comes from cars not the source of production. Your view on the cost of oil does not take into account the how it’s accessibility and low cost is the reason the last 30 years have seen poverty rates decline to historic lows. Taxing oil will keep the poor down.
9256 2018-12-21 19:15:18 But we literally do not have enough homes to house every person. To your energy & car analogy: there are alternatives to oil (renewables) and cars (transit, etc); the alternative to homes is *homelessness*
9257 2018-12-21 19:15:17 When will the wars for oil end? When will people realize that Trump is just a puppet of the banking elite/multinational corporations just like every president before him?

They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
9260 2018-12-21 19:15:13 The connections for the oil and power are blind, only Ethernet and serial data (control and indication) come through the front. The power supply has its own control software to provide protection for the miners.

9269 2018-12-21 19:14:15 I order mine on amazon it’s called Radha rosehip oil! Just throw a little bit on after you wash your face and if your face feels too oily just spray a little rose water on and your skin should feel really good!

9273 2018-12-21 19:13:48 I stopped using regular lotions and commercial perfumes a long time ago! It’s coconut oil or other natural oils for everything & I blend my own smell goods with essential oils! How about you?

9279 2018-12-21 19:13:31 So by all means, let's not even funking try. Let's not try to MINIMIZE our use of petroleum products. Let's don't even try to find new materials. Let us just throw our collective funking hands in the air like toddlers and say, oh well, can't be done without oil. Merpy derp.

9287 2018-12-21 19:12:34 Too bad we can't refine and use our own oil! Instead we send dirty oil to the states, risk more dangerous environmental damage should there be a spill, derailment or crash all so Ontario can pay premium prices, & employ American workers!
9288 2018-12-21 19:12:32 thought this was short cycle oil - all responsive & nimble.  Now it's inertia?

9290 2018-12-21 19:12:17 Turkey absolutely does care about NATO. The Kurds will be fine. And yes, the US does not need NATO, but Europe does need the US to be in NATO. The US was just there to get Saudi Prince Bandar his oil pipeline route to Europe.  If you go to the ME, this is common knowledge.

It absorbs quickly so you're not left oily but it leaves your skin moisturized & satisfied! & it goes deeper in the skin than anything I've ever tried, penetrating the dermal layer, most moisturizers don't go this deep.

9325 2018-12-21 19:07:48 Like a Chevy dealer telling you it is normal to burn a quart of oil every 800 miles? I have had that happen. Stop buying them if that is the way they are going to treat us
9326 2018-12-21 19:07:43 "Stop taking your meds cuz Big Pharma."

"Stop going more than walking distance from home cuz Big Oil."

"Stop eating cuz Big Ag."

#Twitter is no less corrupt than #Facebook. 

Bots, trolls, influence campaigns, Russians galore. You reach people where they are. 

On FB.
9327 2018-12-21 19:07:41 Wait?!Maybe I got you wrong....Engine oil? Like the one used for vehicles?!
Cuz I think using crude oil is just bae
9328 2018-12-21 19:07:16 It's not as presented. It's a return to policy before it was changed during Obama admin, allowing states to exempt more able bodied workers with no children from EXISTING work requirements in areas above 10% unemployment.  
Today that is virtually nowhere.
9329 2018-12-21 19:06:54 Horse manure, you failed on all the major fronts, the oil  economy, foreign policy with China and the US, and so on. Yes you are good at photo ops.
9330 2018-12-21 19:06:52 The dawn commercials really bother me and here is why. They either cover the ducklings in oil themselves or they wait until they get a camera to was them off. Neither are acceptable

9332 2018-12-21 19:06:43 How does organic matter become oil and gas?
9333 2018-12-21 19:06:32 got cherry limeade flavored cbd oil 
9334 2018-12-21 19:06:32 I would just like to send a Merry Kissmyass to @TSA and/ or @SouthwestAir for spilling alll my expensive ass toner and hair oil in both of my toiletry bags. I had the shit in the clear travel containers y’all demand and STILL somehow y’all messed my shit up
9335 2018-12-21 19:06:22 Solo con la participación del pueblo organizado , y sectores avanzados, movimiento revolucionario,y en un profundo debate político idiologico,se podrá alcanzar soluciones de la grave crisis económica y moral que vive la patria Bolivariana.!
9336 2018-12-21 19:06:02 Looks like oil should drop more as per this news
9337 2018-12-21 19:06:01 All you need is shampoo, conditioner and oil
9338 2018-12-21 19:05:47 Oil Dey my head 
9339 2018-12-21 19:05:47 What's not to love about oil and gas? Ok, sure the planet may not survive, and we're visiting untold horrors on the next generation, but c'mon! It's oil! And gas!
9340 2018-12-21 19:05:40 Making $100k a year in some place that also has only $825 monthly rent? Either they have roommates or they’re an oil and gas worker in North Dakota
9341 2018-12-21 19:05:40 Motor Oil Is Motor Oil Sis
9342 2018-12-21 19:05:29 So, its all about the shutdown ~ to cover what he gave to Putin for Christmas. One Iranian/Russian oil pipe line and the inevitable  slaughtering of our close allies the Kurds. The fuckin moronic .@POTUS strikes again. America what have you become?  #TraitorTrump #LiarInChief
9343 2018-12-21 19:05:25 I hate paying this money for this oil change

9345 2018-12-21 19:05:19   you will rather buy oil to massage it
9346 2018-12-21 19:05:17 everybody with daddy issues is way overdue for their car’s oil change

9351 2018-12-21 19:04:50 I know we're deep within summer bc my coconut oil is in it's liquid phase 24/7
9352 2018-12-21 19:04:18 My buddy that changes oil down at Walmart had to have a psych eval. I mean... He's batshit crazy but so is Trump so....
9353 2018-12-21 19:04:12 Bruh me everytime I just take my car for an oil change at my dealership smh and they come up with all this shit 
9354 2018-12-21 19:04:02 They’re already in place.  Midstream pipelines from west Texas and New Mexico is mostly in the oil private world. Won’t show you on a terminal or any public data space.  EIA shows it soon on their monthly report.
9355 2018-12-21 19:03:59 ... Girard doesn't — obviously — denies that scarcity entails violence as well (oil, platine...). He's more interested in what he calls the “metaphysical desire” : humans ontologically tend to acquire the being of (some) others
9356 2018-12-21 19:03:54 U can come up w/money for a stupid wall, but not for ACA healthcare? Keep  bringing in cocaine/opium in by the kilo in your ships holds in cooking oil, etc for Russia/Afghanistan, South America. But u expect us to keep paying for all of your health/retirement benefits?  Really?
9357 2018-12-21 19:03:51 Boiling Oil is THE growth industry for 2019.

9359 2018-12-21 19:03:43 Be careful about image searches involving candles, oil, and dreidels.
9360 2018-12-21 19:03:31 It's called misdirection the standard strategy of the snake oil salesman or woman you tory!
9361 2018-12-21 19:03:28 Oil Stocks

I just bought some BP.  

The stock is currently trading for around $37.50, earnings are up 22% YOY, and they pay a dividend of 6.5%.  Although the trend on this stock is down, I feel like it is a good fundamental play.
9362 2018-12-21 19:03:28 Hey, what do you know? Fabinho starts again! Clearly on his way out on loan to oil rich billionaires! 
9363 2018-12-21 19:03:23 About to get an oil change and fully expecting to walk out with a new car bc of all the stuff they’ll say is wrong 
9364 2018-12-21 19:03:23 the oil is bad
9365 2018-12-21 19:03:23 Lol biggest snake oil salesmen on Twitter
9366 2018-12-21 19:03:21 When I was a student (back in the OPEC oil crisis days), the library was so hot that half of the people in there were asleep on the desks and in the cubicles.
9367 2018-12-21 19:03:02 Never mind things like court rulings. Those pesky things are always getting in the way. You guys need to diversify alongside your oil addiction. Bring in some manufacturing or Green energies. Spread your wings a bit. This coming from a guy whose living is based on oil product.
9368 2018-12-21 19:02:55 Just #walkaway from Twitter you snake oil salesman
9369 2018-12-21 19:02:48 Eggs fried with baby oil

9370 2018-12-21 19:02:44 Well my doctor says that fish oil supplements help boost fertility so that might help
9371 2018-12-21 19:02:26 When you're championing a report that willfully failed to distinguish between oil industry donations and Texas voters who happen to work in a statewide industry making individual contributions to a campaign, you're no judge of journalistic ethic.
9372 2018-12-21 19:02:21 I only meant the one above -“you keep referring to ‘snake oil salesmen’. Don’t see the irony in some of the methods, used by HMRC, to sell Parliament, MPs and the public on the idea that the LC isn’t retrospective and somehow follows from Rangers or collects the right tax?”
9373 2018-12-21 19:02:19 Measurements on dropper? is it thick oil like resin or thin oily, like olive oil?
9374 2018-12-21 19:02:16 That includes Beto voting repeatedly against big oil, fracking, the keystone pipeline
9375 2018-12-21 19:02:11 years last rig counts always suspicius and must not consider much, US generally for rig claim needed to open before years end, Canada always closes massive number rigs last week of the year and opens them back in new year. Look YOY #oott #usoil #oil #crudeoil #rigcount
9376 2018-12-21 19:02:10 Every one is thanking UAE govt. for coming to rescue Pakistan in the time of need, but no one is telling how have they done it ? $, loan, oil or something else?
9377 2018-12-21 19:01:56 There is no such thing as a minor oil spill unless you're in someone pocket in trying to cover it up
9378 2018-12-21 19:01:43 need to hire someone just to put oil and creams for me cuz I’m too lazy to do all of this
9379 2018-12-21 19:01:41 In a vacuum yes.  It's also when they re-opened Bretton Woods gold window thru CNY & began buying oil in CNY fr Russia, something that would have put tremendous downward pressure on CNY/USD.  Few consider if FX rsv selling was simply managing that (there is much to say it was)
9380 2018-12-21 19:01:34 I have read the link sorry I see no mention of Kenny saying Quebec is importing Saudi oil. I'm sorry I can't fix your lo info status. Merry Christmas to you
9381 2018-12-21 19:01:32 Mane don’t ever go to jiffy lube for an oil change 
9382 2018-12-21 19:01:28 Baby oil too.
9383 2018-12-21 19:01:28 What surprises me about the Mexico wall is that Mexico is STUNNING and immensely rich in coastline and resources. I’m surprised the US doesn’t open the border then plunder their nation like we do with oil rich countries. Like shooting ourself in the foot.

9384 2018-12-21 19:01:21 Have to assume we are now oil indepenent without even considering tha Canadians.
9385 2018-12-21 19:01:20 Crude oil almost cut it but engine oil is best
9386 2018-12-21 19:01:11 --- Thanks Federal Reserve.
--- Thanks Democrats for your petty #resist and obstruct agenda.
--- Yes! Democrats hate war for oil, right?
--- Sessions was feckless. Part of the club.
--- So what?
--- Good.
--- Hope he enjoys his long awaited retirement. Served with honor and valor
9387 2018-12-21 19:01:08 Oh I don’t know, maybe declare independence and keep our oil money to build a better infrastructure denied us by Westminster who don’t see beyond the M25.

9390 2018-12-21 19:00:57 So a barrel of Saudi oil is cheaper then AB oil?
9391 2018-12-21 19:00:56 So, uh Merlin

Does he do oil changes for the cheap
9392 2018-12-21 19:00:55 As at 9M 2018 oil and gas accounts for 51% of Diamond loan book which is mirrored in the NPL as well. Power is 9% of loans and that asset is a legacy challenged one. Would be interested in Diamonds 2018 FY. These things make a mockery of auditors though

9403 2018-12-21 18:59:49 1/2 Can even ONE environmental activist please give me a solid explanation on how removing Canadian, responsibly produced oil products will reduce the global demand for oil.  Will it not be replaced by other nations who have terrible human rights or environmental records?
9404 2018-12-21 18:59:42 Not surprising that a Globalist Puppet would dislike peace and think its dangerous not to be killing people to control their oil and gas. ISIS is an Obama creation! Laughing at Gadoffi’s death is reptilian
9405 2018-12-21 18:59:23 Stop painting your brother black just to win. Remember you are the owner of the black paint. Stop this hatred and bitterness, if you keep fighting someone that is succeeding especially anyone with a special oil and grace upon, you will surely die.

9409 2018-12-21 18:59:03 Pat your events are not in sequence or media has been sleeping on the slavery issue in Libya but those groups that evolved is in my understanding from the result of USA invading their land in the name of overthrowing saddam and seeking weapon of mass destruction just 4 the oil

9415 2018-12-21 18:58:11 Meanwhile the oil lobby is whipping up oil crisis hysteria and Albrexit nonsense. The Feds pour some more public money on the squeaky wheel but the industry turns up its nose. The real targets of the oil lobby are JT, Rachel and bill C-69. They want the Harper days back.
9416 2018-12-21 18:58:03 Does anyone know if you’re supposed to do any routine maintenance on an Ultrex? Like, should I be changing oil or updating the computer or something? It just seems way more fancier than a regular tm.
9417 2018-12-21 18:57:52 I’ll check it out. Cannabinoids are obviously not the same a sugar pills for some things (they have psychoactive elements) but CBD oil lacks most of the active compounds and the evidence for effects on muscles is not there. -G
9418 2018-12-21 18:57:48 told my dad i had a shitty day yesterday and he took my car from the parking lot of my work and washed it, got me gas, and an oil change. I DONT DESERVE THIS MAN.
9419 2018-12-21 18:57:46 Ok so I use the soothe regimen from Rodman fields and it takes all the redness out of my face and it’s keeps my face so soft. And I don’t breakout from the oil. It’s awesome.
9420 2018-12-21 18:57:27 It’s called reporting and journalism, not attacking. The oil industry still in operation is a real attack. It’s an attack on our environment, drinking water, and citizens health with carcinogenic material.
9421 2018-12-21 18:57:22 Zzzz waiting to be helped out at @goodyear and good god they are slow! Just want to see about an oil change but honestly I’ve waited 10 mins without any acknowledgement or anything! I miss having my dad work! @pepboysauto was soooo much better!!

9428 2018-12-21 18:56:55 Been waiting to get my oil changed for an hour 
9429 2018-12-21 18:56:50 We just crossed into the fossil fuel convo bringing up Jair after the Petrobras scandal and Syria, where Russians want another route to pipe their gas into Europe. 

War/Proxy battles, oil and currency is an entirely different conversation though.
9430 2018-12-21 18:56:38 There won't BE any fascism if governments fall apart from being unable to provide food and water for their people. What was that saying the water-protectors who opposed DAPL? "You can't eat money, and you can't drink oil."?
9431 2018-12-21 18:56:38 chiquilinada... Si quiere analizar ese punto ya le dije, elija uno y lo analizamos, tmb le recuerdo q durant el gob d Evo el oil cayó a 30 u$s y hace + d 4 años q está alrededor d los 50 u$s. Esto resalta la acertada idea d diversificar e industrializar el gas...

Raqqa was majority non Kurdish

The US occupied oil fields illegally, immorally & violently that belong to ALL Syrians of ALL groups

Collaborators!
9438 2018-12-21 18:56:19 Oil happened
9439 2018-12-21 18:56:15 I certainly will not vote for anyone that takes oil money. I hope that info is available.
9440 2018-12-21 18:56:13 I like them roasted with sesame oil and cayenne pepper
9441 2018-12-21 18:56:10 You say oil production growth was not part of the Trump plan? (it's not Navarro's department). Dereg was begun in 2017, but even on Jan. 1, 2018 production was forecast to grow 1mm bpd and it grew 1.5mm. It's a tech-driven supply shock, not just based on price.
9442 2018-12-21 18:56:00 Beto pledged not to take contributions of over $200 from “the PACs, executives, or front groups of fossil fuel companies." He took 29 large donations from fossil fuel executives. Thus he broke the pledge. Texans in oil and gas can donate to Beto. It's about his pledge he took.

9449 2018-12-21 18:55:05 Surrendering Syria opens the tap again for stolen oil via ISIS/ISIL through Turkey, over the Black Sea and through Crimea into Russia.

Surrendering Afghanistan gives up the poppy trade (ok not so bad) and access to the rare earth metals required for modern technology (a killer.)

9453 2018-12-21 18:54:51 Weed to be smoked gets decarbed in the whole light-it-on-fire-before-you-inhale thing.  Weed to be made into oil, butter, sugar, etc, needs to be decarbed because it is NOT lighted.  Lemme look at the list.

9461 2018-12-21 18:53:34 Placed a Foley on a patient yesterday and forgot the extra lube packets in my pocket so when I got in my car lastnight I took them out and put them in my cup holder and I went to get my oil changed and the guy said nice lube 
9462 2018-12-21 18:53:33 @silkdynastystx Are u waiting for another low in oil to buy? Or did u buy now?
9463 2018-12-21 18:53:14 Yeah!! Doing well with 27 bankrupt states, $27b FR, $2 ECA balance, non payment of 81months old pensions arrears, oil price at $30 Per barrels, crude production at 800k BPD!! To whom brain is given sense is expected
9464 2018-12-21 18:52:46 To start a fire with rocks anymore and were just too dang dependent on those fancy matches and oil lamps!
9465 2018-12-21 18:52:39 Hai next year we go look for anointing oil
9466 2018-12-21 18:52:33 Bruh the weed booty tho i just wanted to support black business if u ever go there bring a wax or oil pen cuz that jamaica weed i was smokin just cause lmaooo
9467 2018-12-21 18:52:32 in our country they are selling CBD oil and it very expensive it cost thousands
9468 2018-12-21 18:52:32 God damn I feel so relaxed after that massage, hot stone and lavender oil for 80 minutes. Never done that before
9469 2018-12-21 18:52:31 When has he EVER been a man of his word? C’mon @KamalaHarris - he’s a snake oil salesman
9470 2018-12-21 18:52:21 Мне понравилось видео "TECH - Electric car with oil disc brakes part 3 - Frame the electric car"
9471 2018-12-21 18:51:50 My across the street neighbor just told me she sells CBD oil, and does card readings lol. I got you thenlol
9472 2018-12-21 18:51:46 Its a shame your two own brand Christmas puds I looked at on your website both still have palm oil given all the attention you have drawn to it? Disappointed and won't be coming in store- the search continues. #PalmOil #christmaspudding
9473 2018-12-21 18:51:34 Burt’s bees deep cleansing cream and Noxzema daily deep pore twice or once a day followed by neutrogena’s oil free moisturizer for sensitive skin 
9474 2018-12-21 18:51:20 I can clearly remember how they sunk the chips into a sizzling vat of oil and being so impressed.
9475 2018-12-21 18:51:17 I need to take my car to get an oil change this weekend
9476 2018-12-21 18:51:14 lord pray for the baby oil manufacturers of the world

9478 2018-12-21 18:51:02 But unlike other EM's i guess India is more vulnerable to crude oil prices when it moves northwards. Once crude crosses ~$65, India starts to worry and slowly in corporate results and stock markets. But thanks to shale and US becoming net exporter of oil
9479 2018-12-21 18:50:55 Maybe the news hasn’t made it to South Africa yet but he’s a crook, carnival clown, snake oil salesman who sexually assaulted multiple women (admittedly). He rode a porn star raw while his wife was home with a newborn. He’s repulsive and I can’t wait for him to be impeached.
9480 2018-12-21 18:50:55 what does he have to say abt oil
9481 2018-12-21 18:50:48 The fake news has legitimately reported on your works with Russia & china. You refuse to sanction Putin & the only thing you have done with China is create a tarrifs war which is particularly devistating our farmers. China ignores your sanctions & still ships oil to N korea
9482 2018-12-21 18:50:32 Sounds like snake oil to me. Not one of you had a "clouds and the rain" moment. Sounds like a haven for lonely, horny, hopeless blokes hoping for a free feel.
9483 2018-12-21 18:50:26 Could you support the #GreenNewDeal already? We are facing global climate catastrophe. Screw the oil companies and their lobbying power. You look like a total shill in their pockets and it costs you all integrity and authority.
9484 2018-12-21 18:50:11 Afaik it was gluten and dairy free. It had soy and egg but I eat those most days. I’m guessing maybe oil and/or MSG as it was Thai Fried Rice.
9485 2018-12-21 18:50:10 This and tires are the ones I know how to do. Basically add more oil.
9486 2018-12-21 18:50:10 Electric cars for the rich and everyone else walks or busses. Oil and gas dead. Too bad AB.
9487 2018-12-21 18:50:00 WTI crude oil plummets to fresh 16-month lows around $45.6 area. Baker Hughes rig count +10. #OOTT
9488 2018-12-21 18:49:38 Except the oil industry ,the car industry, and almost everyone except Quebec. Throwing money at problems is no substitute for leadership.

9497 2018-12-21 18:48:26 It's ok to check oil, transmission fluid, power steering fluid, brake fluid, coolant level, tire pressure and wiper fluid level.  It's also ok to fill the tank with gas.  Routine maintenance also includes cleaning the inside of cars and washing the exterior of the car.
9498 2018-12-21 18:48:19 Yet you give your oil Tax revenue to out of state oil companies gladly with glee in your eyesand at the end when oil is dead the oil companies will leave you with nothing but a radioactive waste land that will cost your state trillions to clean upcan’t fix complete stupidity
9499 2018-12-21 18:48:16 Someone sit with me while I get my oil changed.
9500 2018-12-21 18:48:11 Urgh! :(

9503 2018-12-21 18:47:58 Oil companies dump oil in seas, it hurts sea life. Stop use of oil and stop oil companies from doing this. #sealivesmatter #nomoreoceanoil
9504 2018-12-21 18:47:46 Any excuse when oil prices are so low.
9505 2018-12-21 18:47:38 Perhaps too old school. The military types are pretty rigid, something that is like oil & water when dealing with a businessman like Trump. In the final analysis, Trump was elected POTUS, Mattis was appointed. His letter was born out of anger, something he should have risen above
9506 2018-12-21 18:47:35 Let's hold our breaths for that
9507 2018-12-21 18:47:34 you don't like 'em cuz whoever has been cooking them over the years has been cooking them wrong lol  they get bitter when over boiled & cooked to death

9509 2018-12-21 18:47:31 I agree regarding #gkp as long as the oil price go’s back up to a reasonable level and not down even further. Having said that, I do think oil is around the bottom here. I like gkp at these levels. You never know, might even get taken out for a fiver...
9510 2018-12-21 18:47:30 I need my oil changed bad ! And this man don’t even be at work !!!
9511 2018-12-21 18:47:29 isn’t cbd oil already legal?
9512 2018-12-21 18:47:26 Nope .  I’m going to use even more oil.

9515 2018-12-21 18:47:16 So power hungry @AJWVictoriaBC gave up LNG and Site C, both cornerstones of long term environmental policy for BC, in order to shove his PropRep referendum down our throats. Now what? Back to blocking pipelines for US Oil, I guess...
9516 2018-12-21 18:47:11 Want better change in oceans? You can help! Change consumer habits and keep bad oil out of oceans. #controlconsumerism #nomoreoceanoil

9518 2018-12-21 18:47:06 All right, Ms. No oil. Give up all use of petroleum immeadiately. No driving, flying, heating your home, electronics, email, internet for you. Up for it?  It’s a challenge for you, I love challenges. If you were serious, you would do it NOW. #Hypocrites
9519 2018-12-21 18:46:38 I think I knew one or two when I was that age. All chemical engineers for oil companies.

9521 2018-12-21 18:46:37 Then why are you so hell bent on oil pipelines? You seem hypocritical to me.

9523 2018-12-21 18:46:29 They're out here stopping traffic as a demonstration against a government who comitted $10b or so to a pipe, and threw in another $1.6b to backstop a bad oil market, and that sentiment is damn near universal. Doesn't seem very narrow or impotent.
9524 2018-12-21 18:46:27 manufacturing employment is the U.S. is up, but b/c of domestic demand growth/ the stimulus + renewed oil investment.    that wasn't the Trump/ Navarro theory of the case.
9525 2018-12-21 18:46:25 decision making by a compromised, impulsive sociopath, feckless ring leader of a criminal enterprise.. and POTUS.. supported by a solid 38% of the country and a Party of morally deficient politicians, wholly owned by big oil, PHARMA, Koch dark money .. & the Putin government.
9526 2018-12-21 18:46:22 This was discussed by former US policy advisor brzezinski. I don't think he wants real destabilisation in Europe as he sells lots of oil and gas to the EU market,

9532 2018-12-21 18:46:00 A journalist would never suggest that donations from individual Texas donors who happen to work in a statewide industry are the equivalent of oil industry donations. And yet, weirdly, that happened here. Mind you, I am not for Beto; I am done trashing any potential Dem. nominee.
9533 2018-12-21 18:45:46 Whip together 2 tablespoons cheese with 9 oz cherry. Mix in Olive Oil. Cut with butter. Serve over basmati rice.
9534 2018-12-21 18:45:35 It is Canadians from Quebec and the maritimes. They kiboshed energy east. And with all the ridiculous shit going on out of Saudi Arabia they should be boycotting Irving oil out of principle.
9535 2018-12-21 18:45:31 @KremlinRussia_E I know there is no reason to do so as France doesn’t have any oil or gaz but it starts smelling like a real dictatorship in here.

9536 2018-12-21 18:45:28 Roadmaps are nice to have, but need to be dynamic. Milestones, on the other hand need not change so much. Zero emissions is a one milestone. Assuming oil companies cannot change, putting one out of business is another milestone.

9545 2018-12-21 18:45:05 Well, one was a blip in the price of oil in the middle of an expansion, the other happened in a catastrophic crash of the whole economy.
9546 2018-12-21 18:44:45 How would he restructure the debt? Debt is debt you must pay back with intrest. If the intrest rates go up the government also has to pay back with the new rate. Like I said the petrol dollar is the only thing keeping the dollar afloat. The irony is that oil or as Americans say
9547 2018-12-21 18:44:41 If shale oil CEO’s used the oil price rout to buyback their own depressed shares now instead of investing in new wells and increasing oil production they would generate higher returns for their shareholders.
9548 2018-12-21 18:44:37 EE did not have enough interest in regards to capacity so was dropped by the Company planning to build it.  People oft assume that eastern refineries will us Alberta oil. Some are not tooled for it and as those refineries are private businesses, they buy from whom even they want.

9553 2018-12-21 18:44:23 IDK though, a luminous hazel-eyed ENTJ oil heiress, waving long and lustrous hair off her face while pulling on a cream-colored sunbonnet, is quietly walking with a chestnut Isabella horse.
9554 2018-12-21 18:44:20 Claiming someone is in the pocket of oil industry and then citing donations that aren't corporate but are instead individualized Texas voters who work in that statewide industry is very much a decontextualized and purposed attack. And he did that.
9555 2018-12-21 18:44:17 Natural Alternative:  Wild oregano oil. Take few drops daily, boost your immune system, its a viral and bacterial antibiotic...protect yourself all year round!  No to toxic flu shot...Wild Oregano oil,  natural and safe alternative!
9556 2018-12-21 18:44:11 Please obstruct the dollar's entrances to Iran from Herat's borders in Afghanistan and Sulaimaniyah's borders.

9557 2018-12-21 18:44:08 There is sense in what they do. It didn't make sense to the grunts on the ground, but it did make sense overall. Syria was about oil and interests, that's all. It was another stupid war waged for the benefit of everybody except the US peasants
9558 2018-12-21 18:44:05 y'all know where I can send RBG some blessed oil?
9559 2018-12-21 18:44:04 Kale > iceberg lettuce in all situations. Massaging the kale with a bit of oil & vinegar or lemon will make it less tough when raw. You might already know that, but I just discovered kale massaging this year and have become a proselytizer about it.
9560 2018-12-21 18:43:58 Many employees in Texas work for the oil and gas industry so the fact that  he got money from them  is true if understandable.  However he does not need the money he got from an oil executive and his voting record on the subject should be explained to make him a viable candidate

9564 2018-12-21 18:42:54 India is doing well. Indian 50 is positive and so is their Rupee. Think about why this is. #Commodities have taken a hit and India has MANY ways to boost their GDP. Exporting #oil is not something that contributes a lot to their GDP where as in other economies, this IS the case.
9565 2018-12-21 18:42:49 Another chaotic week for OIL & related exposure. I only have one pure play tho otherwise far worse. '19 should highlight deep value in #GKP. Elsewhere,UK & European Nat Gas continues to show strength. UK NBP & Dutch TTF +10% & +7% over past 2 weeks.#SQZ & #RPT both super steady
9566 2018-12-21 18:42:41 Whats funny is that if shale oil dropped the tech like obsession with growth at all costs and spent capex within cash flow then the entire industry would have made a lot more money in the last few years. EOG is not uber. Selling more oil at lower prices isnt winning.
9567 2018-12-21 18:42:37 @FoxNews Ask yourself why influential right wing nuts Like Hannity Levin Limbaugh & other drones on Fox not news wont go into elected office? Its because they get paid VERY well as snake oil salesman & have to keep up the propagation of bullshit spreading & division to get rich!!
9568 2018-12-21 18:42:33 Kind of like when oil companies get fined millions of dollars; which sounds impressive to those of us who will never see that kind of money in our lifetimes, but is less than a few hours of operating profit for them and is just another cost of continuing to do business as usual.
9569 2018-12-21 18:42:32 What pipeline are you referring to? The pipeline to provide oil to turkey and Europe (our allies) through Syria or the Russia backed pipeline to feed oil to Syria? Your point doesn’t really make sense. What also doesn’t make sense is us turning our backs on the Kurds... again

9571 2018-12-21 18:42:27 No sale. He's got a bet down and I'm tired of the dishonesty in that. He purposely manicured a report so that Beto seemed to be taking oil industry money rather than individual donors. That's decontextualized horseshit. I'm not for Beto. Or for running him down. Same w/any Dem.

9573 2018-12-21 18:42:23 clearly a function of two things:

a) revival in oil 
b) strong domestic US demand

doesn't rebut my argument, namely that a large share of revival in US demand is flowing to the United States' trading partners
9574 2018-12-21 18:42:19 lolol i asked ‘how’ are those.
but hell yeah the coconut oil base is nice. that’s what they use in the CBD isolate stuff i’ve been using has
9575 2018-12-21 18:42:18 Can't wait to move to a climate where my coconut oil is always in liquid form
9576 2018-12-21 18:42:14 You got oil, belts, tire rotations, brakes, lights, registration, insurance, having a car is a curse lol
9577 2018-12-21 18:42:08 So not sure why you posted this narrative in reply to the original posting, Jay. Since the original posting was about the lies that our PM put forward (notice the second half which was a rebuttal from oil company) I get you hate conservatives, but come on Jay, Really?
9578 2018-12-21 18:42:08 Your Irving masters must be pleased, I myself have boycotted Irving and their Saudi oil imports

9580 2018-12-21 18:41:58 Thanks to the coale this area is a fragile swiss cheese, the people had to live with decades of polluted air (finally they have fresh air now) and coale, beside oil, delayed alternative fuels for decades. Seems Bild is still having amnesia.
9581 2018-12-21 18:41:54 No, I'm the guy who said "vote her out", stood up for Alberta's oil patch from the start & has for many years been calling for tougher sanctions against Iran, Pakistan, Russia & Saudi Arabia, a more rigorous policy towards China, as well as an enhanced Canadian defence budget.
9582 2018-12-21 18:41:50 Don't know, but US has same problem - we owe $100-200T in Entitlements (that's just public sector.)  Here's the really funny thing though: If the world doesn't dump the USD, the world will pay for our entitlements thru oil inflation when we print & then export them $100-200T.
9583 2018-12-21 18:41:41 The best way you clean up oil based printing ink is by using more oil so now my entire desk and myself are covered in canola oil, I’m in hell.
9584 2018-12-21 18:41:36 If only much of the western world didn't need the oil from the middle east it could sell them all the arms they could pay for and leave the warring #Islamic tribes and factions to destroy themselves, bringing the world to a potentially more peaceful future.
Merry Christmas!
9585 2018-12-21 18:41:34 Coming to work yesterday and the change oil light comes on & going home the low tire pressure light came on.. if that’s an indication of how the holiday will be, I’m staying home!!

9587 2018-12-21 18:41:32 Rub some eucalyptus oil on the back of your neck and on your temples! My last concussion resulted in horrible horrible migraines quite often that even medicine can’t help. So I sit in a dark room, lay down, and rub the oil on. Doesn’t work for everyone but worth a shot!
9588 2018-12-21 18:41:24 そのくらい察してほしい…
9589 2018-12-21 18:41:13 But we're supposed to be the world's leader in oil production in a few years?!$
(I guess it's fuck earth, let's suck her dry and put it all in the atmosphere)
Wtf
9590 2018-12-21 18:40:48 We are only in Syria as paid mercenaries for Saudi Arabia who wish to run an oil pipeline through Syria against the wishes of Assad.
9591 2018-12-21 18:40:47 would expect that to weaken with fall in oil prices

but part of the point of the article is that US manufacturing doesn't depend heavily on foreign demand, e.g. manufacturing export base (and in recent qs growth) is weak
9592 2018-12-21 18:40:41 What if they wind up with Yemens military hardware and they threaten Saudi oil? The 'JV team' is still playing, while we slink away.
9593 2018-12-21 18:40:40 Rumsfeld said the Iraqis would pay for the war with the sale of their oil. Both lies.
9594 2018-12-21 18:40:36 @nhg7280 oil the bill @realhewitt
9595 2018-12-21 18:40:35 These are big energy companies, not just big oil companies. They aren’t short sighted and are probably working on sustainable energy as we speak. The reason why the oil industry is so important for AB because it turns that negative 10 billion into a positive.
9596 2018-12-21 18:40:32 I’d imagine (if oil is really the issue) that the Qatar-Turkey pipeline has some sort of strategic advantage the US interests that could be crippled if Russia had control of the pipeline instead
9597 2018-12-21 18:40:31 Money managers have increased their bullish ICE Brent crude oil bets by 12,403 net-long positions to 152,000, weekly ICE Futures Europe data on futures and options show.

9598 2018-12-21 18:40:29 3/ Greens were not getting what they wanted from R's and D's. They do not support endless war, oil company ownership of govt., & WallSt. bailouts So they formed their own party. That's not stubborn--that's a legitimate way to help move the majority parties in a given direction.

9602 2018-12-21 18:40:18 To the contrary, the problem the US has is the rest of the world is taking that $600B in USDs & locking up finite supplies of rare earths, oil, copper, ports, gold, etc., which ROW will happily sell back to the US at much higher prices in the future (& maybe in CNY.)

9617 2018-12-21 18:39:26 I would do free oil changes as well no matter the place but now that I work for an OEM servicing and purchasing from their dealers is super important because that brand loyalty goes a long way should you need their help with a repair.

9619 2018-12-21 18:39:15 OPEC will have to accept or the other countries will turn to other oil rich nations. Thus the dollar will then be completely worthless. The reason the USA was able to win the cold war(with ease i might add) was due to the petrol dollar.

9634 2018-12-21 18:37:34 It’s our oil u ass and u weren’t gonna offer reconstruction assistance unless Assad left, and wtf would he do that / all US troops did in Syria is bomb the shit out of Raqqa and sent the SDF as cannon fodder to dier ez zour which is a non Kurdish area just to sit on our oil
9635 2018-12-21 18:37:32 No more blood for oil to me is a great idea.
9636 2018-12-21 18:37:21 midstream refers to oil servicing companies like drilling rig operators, marine shipping and the sort
9637 2018-12-21 18:37:20 Questions: Could the oil companies, theoretically, just say “we’re out of here” and shut down all sales points in that area? How okay would people be without fuel for vehicles (boats, cars, busses)? Are there no share-holders? Does Victoria still dump sewage into the ocean?
9638 2018-12-21 18:37:09 I had to get an oil change without my dad and the guy asked me what kind of oil I needed and I have never been more confused in my whole life
9639 2018-12-21 18:36:54 Admittedly I haven’t tried marijuana are derivatives or oil’s all that much but from an experience nothing has helped old injuries or neurological like pain meds do (or did!! I should say) past tense! QOL in a word

9648 2018-12-21 18:35:53 Here's the thing though @LittleTittle1, for the market to work we must internalize all externalities and provide full consideration for future cost, including avoiding climate change, or costing all cosequences must be part of the equation. This is where oil gets expensive.

9652 2018-12-21 18:35:30 Yo, the lack of technology along with a physical barrier on the border are the issues. We find oil miles below the surface. Finding tunnels will be child’s play when similar tech is applied. A ladder! Sensors on the wall will detect an object being placed agains the wall.
9653 2018-12-21 18:35:29 I asked about abiogenesis; you are assuming I don't have some knowledge about how oil is generally thought to primarily be formed.

9658 2018-12-21 18:34:53 @AliVelshi POTUS’s comment is crystal clear 2 me. He said that illegals cost us $ per year & if U build the wall, the slats will create wind & drive turbines, generating power, that he will use 2 drive pumps 2 pull oil from shale, that (yawn) ... & that’s how to pay 4 the wall.
9659 2018-12-21 18:34:51 Not how it works. It costs more today then before the 'sunk costs'.
Costs are things like oil for generators, combat pay and assets required to provide security in combat zone, logistics, etc.
9660 2018-12-21 18:34:43 The corporate dems got a trunk full of oil cash, and the pedal to the metal headed right toward the cliff . They don’t care
9661 2018-12-21 18:34:41 You mean Assad gets the Syrian oil fields back. And he won’t rebuild. He’ll murder more Syrian people.
9662 2018-12-21 18:34:30 Now I know the years you spent is school was a waste. Under whose government Naira went to 360/$? Using d same analogy you virtually earn the same Naira equiv. From crude oil when it was $100 @ N160 and $60 @ N360. We Need to sue ur schl 4 a refund of fees paid.
9663 2018-12-21 18:34:25 U assume so much. I said BOO about Bernie Sanders. Our country needs a progressive movement. Beto can not be a part of that if he takes money from people labeling their donation as "oil & gas." Doesn't matter individual or group. No Dem is winning 2020 with ANY oil money.
9664 2018-12-21 18:34:22 As long as oil is still going to 10, I’m good
9665 2018-12-21 18:34:14 It could be cheap, but mine was not.

It suggests all will be fine again once oil and gas prices rise again and AB and SK are richer again. 
My preference would be for Atlantic Canada to gets is fiscal and economic act together and cooperate on development, reduce size of govt.

9680 2018-12-21 18:32:54 Shale oil is beautiful. But it needs the right price to make money and be cash flow positive as an industry not just the best in class companies. But shale oil acts like its a tech company that needs to grow 25% a year. In reality it should focus on making as much money.
9681 2018-12-21 18:32:54 I miss my Colombian au pair. She was one of the nicest, warmest women I've ever known. Every day she would tell 5 year old me "tú eres el tesoro de dios". She would also massage my head with a lil coconut oil and brush my hair till I fell asleep.
9682 2018-12-21 18:32:50 I’ve been going progressively more veg(an) this year and SERIOUSLY why are there animal parts in literally everything? I guess with roast potatoes they’re traditionally done in duck fat but they’re just as tasty when made with oil so WHY

9687 2018-12-21 18:32:35 Was the selloff in 2015 balance sheet issue too? If oil goes down 40 bucks quickly in 2015 and 2018 and in both cases markets selloff but in one case you have balance sheet unwind and in the other not, wouldn't you conclude the cause is oil, not the balance sheet?

•Lifting up your pride when you would rather quit. #FridayMotivation
9689 2018-12-21 18:32:27 The one and probably only thing that surprises me is that anyone would be surprised of Trudeau shutting down the oil sands. In his own words by his own mouth he said it needed to be phased out. I didn't think he could do it in three years but I was wrong.

9697 2018-12-21 18:31:07 The only thing that will move them is massive policy change. It’s starting in EU with EVs, but US + oil&gas + “freedom” + “Billy Bob” + gerrymandering means we will be last to the party on many things.

9702 2018-12-21 18:30:21 True, but it seems like those places are ripe for it.  We need to get off of our dependence of their oil and then stay out of their lives and maybe they wouldn’t hate us so much.

@RoyaPTI
9707 2018-12-21 18:29:53 Dollar will fall. Then other countries will demand OPEC accept there currency or gold in exchange for oil The only thing that makes the dollar great is that it is the only currency you can buy oil with fron OPEC. Thus making sure every nation has to have dollars.
9708 2018-12-21 18:29:41 I think OPEC now wants the United States to become the largest producer in the world by far such that it needs high or higher oil prices. They want the US to have the same interests as them financially. If US oil production is 20 million, suddenly the US needs higher oil prices.
9709 2018-12-21 18:29:41 What Trump pulling out is doing is basically giving Turkey the green light to go ahead and invade all of Rojava with the US's help as the US now have soldiers placed in the Levant. Meaning that they can make a two pronged attack against the Kurds and then just divy up the oil

9712 2018-12-21 18:29:20 Haha climate change extremists wearing  polyester clothing & waving plastic flags all derived from crude oil..takes 200 yrs or more to bio-degrade
9713 2018-12-21 18:29:13 Rosehip oil to moisturise face, throat and décolletage ... sea salt with a few drops of lavender oil for a body scrub ... coconut oil to moisturise body
9714 2018-12-21 18:29:04 I remember buying a VW without knowing about that. I was used to spending $2 on an oil change. First time I got one done with the VW, it was $100 and I though the guy was trying to strong arm me. I just about lost it.

"Ororo" meaning hot oil...
9717 2018-12-21 18:28:47 JIFFY LUBE GUY pulls out my SPLEEN

"Sir, would you like the SPLEEN replaced this winter?"

"No thanks just the oil change"

The JIFFY LUBE GUY crushes my SPLEEN in his FIST
9718 2018-12-21 18:28:45 Build a terminal at Thunder Bay there is a pipeline there and or Churchill it not that far from the tar sands of Saskatchewan and Alberta .   They say Arctic is ice free now use it build a terminal  up north there a lot of oil up there   Russia’s can see this what is the problem
9719 2018-12-21 18:28:43 The greatest trick the Devil ever played is convincing workers that oil and gas business cares about them and their jobs. #Abpoli
9720 2018-12-21 18:28:38 You can't say you "know technology" when you push for obsolete things like coal and oil, and use Aquanet.
9721 2018-12-21 18:28:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
9722 2018-12-21 18:28:25 What is a good oil to burn tonight
9723 2018-12-21 18:28:18 Enough money to get my teaching certificates to the next level....but more importantly, enough that I didn't have to choose between groceries and oil for heat
9724 2018-12-21 18:28:06 So, anyone setting up the cauldrons of boiling oil gofundme yet? 
I could get behind that.
well, better behind, than under, right?

9727 2018-12-21 18:27:51 in the last 36 hours I have treated my bleach-broken hair with:
- coconut oil mask (overnight)
- Olaplex no.3 for 2 hours
- protein restorative shampoo & conditioner
- 30-min deep conditioning mask

it looks better!!! I am happy!!!
a very short haircut is still on the table
9728 2018-12-21 18:27:50 Last weekend I made brownies for a party and accidentally used Jalapeño infused olive oil and THAT was disgusting
9729 2018-12-21 18:27:34 Oil dipstick next question
9730 2018-12-21 18:27:33 David Simon, creator of The Wire, and longtime idol of mine, just blocked me because he wants to give Beto a handy after @davidsirota reported Beto is an oil money sponge. Centrist hack. Oh, and The Duece is slow and plodding with no fire.
9731 2018-12-21 18:27:30 I don't want to have to explain to the next generation that our coastal cities are under water and our farmland is crippled because it was too inconvenient to give up oil company profitability.
9732 2018-12-21 18:27:29 Yes, dear Tom. I just didn't know which work to choose on his memorial day, but I did know what I would do on that day as I eventually did: visit the @BellasArtesAR again - for the 7th time ! - and enjoy 84 watercolours and one oil in the @tate Collection
9733 2018-12-21 18:27:19 This country has been meddling in the affairs of the Middle East for decades and “what we are getting from it is allies and oil. You seem so uninformed and unintelligent.
9734 2018-12-21 18:27:03 Love how this free oil change turned into a forced 15k mile tune up and $200+

Even better is the 2 hour wait and lack of seating

9735 2018-12-21 18:26:55 candice took me w her to get her oil change & the car company is having their christmas party & walking around w plates full of food. i’ve never been so sad in my life 
9736 2018-12-21 18:26:52 oil cost $3/bbl in 1972.  If you held you were a USD bull holding your money in USDs, you've probably starved to death, having suffered from malnutrition for 40 yrs as your USDs went from buying you filet mignon to dog food to fish food to sawdust.
9737 2018-12-21 18:26:52 Aye, an oil change shouldn’t take this long. 
9738 2018-12-21 18:26:51 How much is tea tree oil please?
9739 2018-12-21 18:26:37 Let them all kill each other over there we don't need their oil anymore World has changed and for the better Americans First 
9740 2018-12-21 18:26:31 @davidhogg111 claiming credit for banning bumpstocks is like Obama claiming credit for the oil boom. Do these two smoke weed 24/7 or think everyone is stupid

9742 2018-12-21 18:26:25 You can’t really prevent inflammation and some of the worst offenders are not animal based- such as oils high in O-6 like sunflower oil.
9743 2018-12-21 18:26:25 Thanks for sharing! Now I'm curious. What's the situation for companies making conventional cosmetics (e.g. shampoo with hemp seed oil) and topical cannabis products? Or for companies making conventional hemp derived NHPs (e.g. hemp seed oil) and cannabis products?
9744 2018-12-21 18:26:19 People are so helpless. It makes me sad. Check your oil. Check your other fluids. Keep an eye on your tire treading. Rotate your tires when you need to. This stuff is not that hard. 
9745 2018-12-21 18:26:13 Just played: Faceshopping - SOPHIE - OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES(MSMSMSM)
9746 2018-12-21 18:26:12 It's 65° the week before Christmas. It's a good thing those plucky oil execs have revealed #GlobalWarming to be a hoax!
9747 2018-12-21 18:26:09 This is hilarious. Turkey has been providing AID to ISIS and their proxies. Buying their oil, giving them safe passage across their borders. They will not do anything against ISIS, they only want to massacre YPG.
9748 2018-12-21 18:26:02 Sure because Britain ton of free oil for the expense of your comfort. Sounds great.
9749 2018-12-21 18:26:00 @brodiegal Are my suspicions correct that the cheese rolls from @WOOLWORTHS_SA are made with palm oil?
9750 2018-12-21 18:25:59 She turns the handle as it begins to fill with warm oil. Oh the joys of a group living chamber

Try a touch of food oil this time around? Odd - it seemed to have jammed so soon after your first picture?
9753 2018-12-21 18:25:47 I’m making “donuts” tonight. Similar to biscuits cuz I use the tube biscuits and then cook them in a little oil and then dust them with cinnamon and sugar.

9765 2018-12-21 18:25:06 Tea tree oil really be saving my skin when i need it
9766 2018-12-21 18:25:05 I was in the waiting room, getting oil changed, and Access HW was on and Michelle walks out in this butt ugly yellow schmatta with those terrible hooker boots and they were FAWNING over her “look?” I mean-come on! Man in a yellow tent with snakeskin thigh high boots is not cute!
9767 2018-12-21 18:24:49 They had large exposure to many casualties of the oil price collapse in midstream and small E&P independents. I always found Uzoma's head in sand posture at calls curious but I stopped looking at Nig banks in March 2017.
9768 2018-12-21 18:24:47 Time will tell and I want both to do well.
Im not impressed with Vonk this week though.
9769 2018-12-21 18:24:44 I run Peanut oil or soybean oil in my diesel truck. No federal/state gas tax. Called Biodiesel made here on the farm. Sometimes I use rendered poultry fats from Tyson Plant near by. I sell them corn to feed their chickens & Plant more corn with biodiesel
9770 2018-12-21 18:24:37 getting my oil changed i hope everythinf i own gets stolen including my car
9771 2018-12-21 18:24:26 Tree's finally up, Christmas oil's burning, Bailey's poured. Not quite feeling it yet. But two weeks off work! Woo hoo 
9772 2018-12-21 18:24:23 We have our own oil, let them pay and die to keep theirs.  W all the wealth they have generated for the last 80-100 years and basically nothing to show for it their countries
9773 2018-12-21 18:24:20 What is your term for Obama who wouldn’t bomb ISIS oil deliveries
9774 2018-12-21 18:23:47 My list:
Buying a fucking pipeline for Alberta.
Keeping Harper's anti environment protection roll backs
Keeping Harper's carbon reduction targets
Continuing to give oil and gas 3.3 billion annual subsidies
Reneging on his #ProportionalRepresentation  promise

@JustinTrudeau
9775 2018-12-21 18:23:47 i went to get an oil change and a new tire this nigga tells me all my tires bald so i need 4 new tires FML
9776 2018-12-21 18:23:44 Trump the liar is saying this is a Democrat Shut Down.  The man does not keep his word as he said he will own the shut down.  Trump is a snake oil salesman 
Mueller bring it all out indict this dictator
9777 2018-12-21 18:23:38 As if that will prevent the oil from being transported. It's being moved by rail now, a much more expensive and potentially dangerous mode.
9778 2018-12-21 18:23:33 Oh look, a photograph of a Sneak Oil Salesman (at best).
9779 2018-12-21 18:23:31 @realDonaldTrump So is your BS statement about your dumb #wall paying for itself like when W said the Iraq war would be funded by Iraqi oil? Yea, thought so. 
9780 2018-12-21 18:23:21 Well at the moment it’s not crashing. Especially if it’s still peeking along with lower oil and natural gas prices. But keep hoping...

9784 2018-12-21 18:23:06 If the world goes into a recession in a multi-currency commodity system (ie if CNY oil contract works), then the currency markets will turn into a deficit & balance sheet contest.  As the ONLY nation w >100% debt/GDP & twin deficits, US will be the dirtiest dirty shirt by far
9785 2018-12-21 18:23:06 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

9789 2018-12-21 18:22:54 I dell CBD oil. This very oil os very effective in all kinds of ailments. Starting from bp,stroke,diabetes, infertility, autism, cholesterol  arthritis etc.Its a suppliment  A trial will convince you.
9790 2018-12-21 18:22:53 use coconut oil to take your makeup off and biore charcoal face wash yo wash your face!
9791 2018-12-21 18:22:48 What about the Wayne National Forest? The only national forest in Ohio which has parcels of land auctioned off to oil and gas. Shame. Is it because it is in SE Ohio and we don’t matter?
9792 2018-12-21 18:22:47 One could just dose with a high potency oil and have a brownie after
9793 2018-12-21 18:22:38 Victoria--a city that had no problem pumping sewage into its harbor has the balls to sue oil companies for their nebulous connection to weather patterns.
9794 2018-12-21 18:22:37 Someone scoop me from tire kingdom while I wait for this oil change :)
9795 2018-12-21 18:22:32 今からOL Oilの”Play All”をクリック…
9796 2018-12-21 18:22:22 So you’re trying to tell me a politician from Texas voted in favour of the oil and gas industry?
9797 2018-12-21 18:22:09 No comparison. Vonk hurts his share holders time and time again. Bet this share price #angs is dragged down for the placeees to have a 2nd bite of the cherry.
9798 2018-12-21 18:22:08 Yes I love them!! I’m planning on getting oil too. I get stressed and anxious super easily and they’ve really been helping me manage that. I love them!!
9799 2018-12-21 18:22:06 Mofo is so greasy that even his hair and skin drips oil
9800 2018-12-21 18:22:01 Major development: we have repeatedly explained gold is held out of fear and/or as a hedge against recession. This week gold went dramatically inverse to oil price drops by rising dramatically. Fear, more than inflation issues, now drives gold's price.
9801 2018-12-21 18:21:59 Mcjesus looks like a damn hippie, oil need to fire that dipshit PC and hire Lou
9802 2018-12-21 18:21:55 Shale oil and electric cars will continue to diminish our need for ME oil
9803 2018-12-21 18:21:55 drown me in coconut oil
9804 2018-12-21 18:21:55 It’s like a regular fryer except without the oil and the unhealthyness
9805 2018-12-21 18:21:52 Not for long... at these levels all shale players loss making. Only a matter of time #oil #oott
9806 2018-12-21 18:21:52 Why do oil changes take an eternity
9807 2018-12-21 18:21:46 BLM Releases Draft EIS for Potential ANWR Oil, Gas Leasing Program
9808 2018-12-21 18:21:45 Utica Shale Oil, Natural Gas Production Both Increased 30% in Third Quarter
9809 2018-12-21 18:21:44 I note you keep referring to ‘snake oil salesmen’ Ray. Do you not see the irony in some of the methods, used by HMRC of late, to sell Parliament, MPs and the public on the idea that the LC isn’t retrospective and somehow follows from Rangers or collects the right tax?
9810 2018-12-21 18:21:37 I got a funny ass brother. Dude say nun of his kids or ain’t nobody getting Christmas. Only thing getting Christmas is his car. Two new tires and a oil change. Man that shh was funny asf I almost died 
9811 2018-12-21 18:21:36 You know they have CBD Beard Oil. Just sayin' you might be interested in that.
9812 2018-12-21 18:21:30 Penski oil I think that’s what is called on ballenger.
9813 2018-12-21 18:21:29 Super Wings gets weird in season 2. Every episode has a "that escalated quickly" moment. "I'll help this brother-sister badminton team cooperate--volcano!" "Let's go find a mermaid--oil tanker ran aground!" But it's always just an aside then back to the main plot. Really jarring.
9814 2018-12-21 18:21:14 US shale has changed the world of oil!
Waarbij stijgende olieprijzen stijgende reserves geven. 
Het omgekeerde is een pijnlijker en moeizamer proces.
9815 2018-12-21 18:21:13 Sounds to me like we want more of the control.. Russia and Syria are allies.  Us and Europe wanted a stop to that a lot to do with oil.
9816 2018-12-21 18:21:12 So take some action and stop leasing the Wayne National Forest to oil and gas. Fracking releases CO2. Take action.
9817 2018-12-21 18:21:11 A bottle of wine, a piece of coppa and one of bacon from a supplier, salami, rice, oil, dried mushrooms, lentils, two bottles of wine, panettone and some sweets from the employer of my boyfriend...I love food #xmasgifts
9818 2018-12-21 18:21:07 I was looking for a stage w/ 2 close walls to just get pinned between but there aren’t any, but then I noticed cpus don’t fall off ledges easily so I just had my back to that oil drum and held the A button. Eventually he did get free though. I thought it would stop at 999.
9819 2018-12-21 18:20:52 I actually don’t like the hot oil , had the breakfast pie this time which was pretty decent  #hotoilgivesmetheruns

-Chocolate
-Tomatoes
-Most meat

9822 2018-12-21 18:20:46 They won't answer those types of questions because they are both receiving pay from Murdoch's news channel. The same Murdoch who sits on the board of Genie Oil & who was recently handed drilling rights in the Golan Heights by Netanyahu.
9823 2018-12-21 18:20:43 Oya now shake body for your Brother nah! My akant has been leaking like oil Spillage since World War 1.
9824 2018-12-21 18:20:36 Vaseline or coconut oil. Treat it like you would chapped lips—May needto reappy frequently throughout the day. And overnight, wrap them in plastic gloves so they can heal.
9825 2018-12-21 18:20:31 I mean so are Popeye and Olive Oil.

9826 2018-12-21 18:20:25 Use coconut oil!!
9827 2018-12-21 18:20:07 Because you are in the remainer camp and you read their posts. OK, you could say that about me but I also see the European firms setting up on the Humber bank since Brexit. DFDS, SIEMENS & lately an aeroplane oil fuel refining company building another refinery here. + others.
9828 2018-12-21 18:19:54 My exact experience last week. Moral: Dont changed oil
9829 2018-12-21 18:19:50 The US was only there for oil and Israel and Saudi Arabia. If anyone thinks the backstabbing Neocon and neolib trash care about the Kurds they need their head examined. How much of the northern Iraq oil is now flowing to Israel courtesy of the Kurds?
9830 2018-12-21 18:19:49 I guess that oil spill in Valdez, and Exxon fighting for decades to reduce the settlement they were supposed to pay to the lives they destroyed, that was free speech too? They can go back to bashing Bernie some more because they've shown once again what a REAL Dem looks like.
9831 2018-12-21 18:19:45 can they please stop using palm oil in eyeshadow palettes????
9832 2018-12-21 18:19:42 So much this. You can only do what you can do. People with money cannot grasp that those making $10 /hr literally cannot save enough to be able to pay for bloodwork to prevent illness or an oil change.

9835 2018-12-21 18:19:19 Ati bonchari kunaweza kuwa na oil
9836 2018-12-21 18:19:19 And Canada. We provide 40% of American oil and have been beside you through thick and thin and yet Mr. Trump treats us worse than he does California. Very strange.
9837 2018-12-21 18:19:12 How when damn near every teacher is liberal? That's brainwashing the young into being trannies and anti oil for ya.
9838 2018-12-21 18:19:05 Dump trump is a Typical snake oil salesman who never admits wrongdoing and runs out of town as soon as there is a trouble.
9839 2018-12-21 18:19:04 Trudeau thinks a small but vocal group of activists are the voice of Quebec. His anti oil agenda of killing the resource industry is coming along nicely.
9840 2018-12-21 18:18:58 I'm pleased with the weaker housing economy. Perhaps my children may be able to live here; I haven't noticed any addition tax dent in my paycheque;  To get off our dependence on Saudi oil you have to build refineries not pipelines with the sole purpose of shipping out dillbit.

9849 2018-12-21 18:18:00 That's a starch clump! Not pretty, but harmless. Starch clumps are a result of the sugars in the potatoes that are released during the frying process. These starches over time collect in the oil, stick together & form clumps. We inspect for these but missed this one. I'm sorry!
9850 2018-12-21 18:17:58 On one level, I agree. Arab nations will always be at war. It's their nature (sons of Ishmael Gen.16:11,12) It's all about sp(oil). Otoh, by pulling out of Syria/Iraq/Afghanistan, we're setting the stage for step-up in Russian/Iranian aggression and endtime Ezekiel 38-39 War. 1/2

9859 2018-12-21 18:17:11 Maybe it is time for Alberta Oil workers to stop blaming the government and start blaming the Oil companies greed and selfishness?
9860 2018-12-21 18:17:11 No way I'm making that right now  I don't use that much oil nor do I use pizza dough though.  . . My dough is currently rising while listening to BTS playlist on Spotify 
9861 2018-12-21 18:17:01 I deliberately waited because I know   such question like budget would arise.Nothing like compulsive desire to seek excuses when we can verify things by& for ourselves. 13% oil derivative allocation to oil producing States& TSA rev generation platform %age are deducted b4 sharing

9872 2018-12-21 18:15:49 This rig counts before new year infact meaningless cause they need open or close for year. Look Canada.

9875 2018-12-21 18:15:36 Like, we would go MOOOOOONTHS without oil changes. Cars don't like that. It breaks them.

Does it cost more in the long run? Of course. But if you have to choose between an oil change or eating, you skip the oil change.
9876 2018-12-21 18:15:33 When you have to choose between an oil change or the water bill...well.

9887 2018-12-21 18:14:40 The oil yes, but not the pipeline. Trains maybe so there can be another disaster?

He's a car guy. Growing up, his dad kept an honest-to-God LEDGER detailing their oil changes and whatnot.

My family... Not so much.
9891 2018-12-21 18:14:30 New York is just New Jersey dipped in truffle oil.
9892 2018-12-21 18:14:13 why don’t you just change ur own oil, it’s a lot cheaper more convenient smhhhh

9894 2018-12-21 18:14:02 I bought my car at a Toyota dealership but since it’s not a Toyota I have to wait longer to get my oil changes. It’s free but I’ve been here an hour now. Annoying as hell.

9902 2018-12-21 18:12:38 I craved Smarties in the hairdresser's chair this morning. Then I read they contained palm oil on the TL of @brodiegal. So, no Smarties bought after the hair appointment, just the items on my shopping list.
9903 2018-12-21 18:12:34 That would be some of the people that are invested in the genie oil corporation or maybe people that set on their board people from halliburton the rothchilds the CIA
9904 2018-12-21 18:12:29 interesting look @ the big picture. I think Israel is pulling all strings for Russia & USA and Syria is key geographical piece of land for expansion of Kushner invested/Israeli owned Genie Oil Pipeline.
9905 2018-12-21 18:12:22 Oil and gas brother. They are everywhere down there
9906 2018-12-21 18:12:21 yeah CBD oil is great, especially when taken on top of several ibuprofen and prescription migraine medicine. really good stuff.
9907 2018-12-21 18:12:19 DEMs want open boarder so drugs human trafficking keep flowing like Obama’s Operation Casandra when DEA & ICE told to stand down over Hezbollah trafficking drugs & girls into us. They want Troops in both Afghanistan to protect the poppies & Saudi Oil pumping across Syria

9909 2018-12-21 18:12:03 SA was the head of the snake, the Commonwealth is the body. The US is part of that, not officially under crown rule, but through land patents, oil companies, corporate bodies, Payseur (see excellent work by @intheMatrixxx) it is the crown that controls it all and SA was a trust.

9916 2018-12-21 18:11:32 Probably plastic wreaths - so you're pretty close, since plastic is made from oil.

9923 2018-12-21 18:10:58 I would just love to have one article of clothing that doesn’t have an oil or grease stain on it. Why am I like this?
9924 2018-12-21 18:10:40 Sounds like full spectrum. We'll get you the pure isolate. It's just pure CBD powder and coconut oil (great delivery agent). I mean it when it's been a miracle for me. Just DM me when you're ready. You won't need as much and I didn't want the flavorings and who knows what else
9925 2018-12-21 18:10:35 They simply wanted a Committee to study Green Energy and Climate Change.  Big Whoop. The old dems just didn't want to irritate their Big Oil Donors. Don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining. please.

9940 2018-12-21 18:09:44 Just don’t get why you keep rooting for more hikes when the previous 9 have already caused an equity bear market. Oil, copper, steel, DRAMS, NAND, aluminum all in big declines. There is no inflation. But PLENTY of slower corporate outlooks. Fed making a mistake.
9941 2018-12-21 18:09:43 Why not give your name? Stand up. Also oil was around before 71.

9943 2018-12-21 18:09:37 I’ve always cooked pasta in a steel pot. I make enough for several meals and refrigerate them in zip-locks.

9952 2018-12-21 18:09:06 A lot.  Delta operates on a level playing field with competitors that are not subsidized by state oil revenue.  By adhering to international treaties and not using ownership to skirt Open Skies agreements, the difference is substantial.

9956 2018-12-21 18:08:55 It may be.  Congress as it stands votes for big oil, and simply will not address global warming.  We should stop drilling, fracking and pipelining right now and start putting square miles of solar in west texas to so cal deserts, and wind on low value land

9979 2018-12-21 18:06:16 This is hilarious. Oil and natural gas industry actively lobbies to pay less in taxes that go directly to the upkeep of communities and roads. This especially harms rural Oklahoma, where they make county dirt roads near impassible when their trucks tear up the roads.

9986 2018-12-21 18:05:36 Oregano oil kills bacteria! If they sell oregano oil pills at like a Whole Foods or something similar to that, take half a pill and suck on it as if it’s a cough drop then a couple of mins later swallow it. I do that at work and girl it works wonders
9987 2018-12-21 18:05:34 Good. Because they are turning into thieves like big pharma. Hundreds for a few mg of CBD. Cheapest I can find is $90 for 2000 mg, makes it economical to grow it at home and just infuse it into coconut oil.
9988 2018-12-21 18:05:32 hell is waiting for an oil change and being forced to listen to the minions movie on like 700 volume

9994 2018-12-21 18:04:59 We use a blend of coconut oil and shea butter as his daily skin care.

9999 2018-12-21 18:04:34 Are you up for eliminating @fraserinstitute too?  The Koch Bros are the biggest donors.  Nothing like private American oil interests driving Canadian policy.
10000 2018-12-21 18:04:32 And of course, those very non linear gas springs are designed in conjunction with their mounting geometry (variable leverage ratio) to provide a nice constant torque, and include oil damping to prevent rapid movements.  Today, often assisted by electric motors too, for the V.lazy
10001 2018-12-21 18:04:27 I am not disputing that was how it might have been sold, the snake oil salesmen in the Isle of Man and elsewhere would tell you anything, but it is simply wrong to say the there is little difference between a Ltd and a loan based tax scheme
10002 2018-12-21 18:04:22 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

10007 2018-12-21 18:03:39 One if the biggest hustles in business is oil change places charging twice as much for high milage oil than low milage oil. Respect, but also thank u next.
10008 2018-12-21 18:03:32 Q: To anyone who thinks animal fats are bad, plant carbs are good: What happens to the carb, once the muscles have their fill? A: Muscles reject more, and send it to the liver, which turns it into fat.  And the liver doesn't make olive oil!  It makes animal fat.

10010 2018-12-21 18:03:23 We are no longer dependent on the Middle East for oil. You don't know what you are talking about!
10011 2018-12-21 18:03:14 So blocking traffic in their own backyard work? If they want to make noise drive to Ottawa or Quebec and shut down their cities. We’re already supporting the Oil industry. We don’t need to be convinced.
10012 2018-12-21 18:03:05 Can't compare conventional oil reserves to oil sands production
10013 2018-12-21 18:02:55 Thank you for the tips, we have never tried hemp oil, any particular brand suggestions.

We have a homeopathic practicitoner that we have seen for a few years, he takes silica once every 10 days which greatly seems to help immensely with his chronic itchiness.

10018 2018-12-21 18:02:31 Dude, the guy promised everything during his campaign. He promised he would bring back the troops as much as he promised he would go full throttle and bomb the shit out of ISIS. His words always meant nothing. He's always been a snake oil salesman with zero credibility
10019 2018-12-21 18:02:31 Get a medical card. The NY MMJ CBD oil is good quality and competitive pricing.
10020 2018-12-21 18:02:29 Exactly. So we agree that simply having a better method isn't all that's needed to effect change, and you see why 

"What's easier compressing gas or drilling for oil?"

doesn't really make any sense.

Not to mention that sequestering carbon from air isn't actually all that easy.
10021 2018-12-21 18:02:23 Better yet, we look like coconut oil and Shea butter

10024 2018-12-21 18:02:14 Less maintenance with electric.  No oil changes, plugs, tuneups, or failed emissions gear.  And performance is as good or better.  My Volt does 0-60 in 7.9 seconds.  Without dragging around fuel and a motor, it would be much faster.  Lots of torque.
