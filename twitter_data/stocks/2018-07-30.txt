37 2018-07-30 23:41:42 These hot takes on the death of FANG are hilarious. What stocks do the “death of FANG” promoters own that have outperformed FANG over more than one week. More importantly, which are you willing to bet on going forward?

40 2018-07-30 23:40:01 The tax cuts benefitted the wealthy the most not the middle class. How’s that stock market doing this year??? Ps the stock market benefits the wealthy the most. The top 20 percent of Americans own 92 percent of the stocks. Stop buying into the propaganda.
41 2018-07-30 23:39:48 Cashman buys low on stocks and sells high on them. That’s what good GM’s do.
42 2018-07-30 23:39:03 Here are the facts. During the Obama admin, unemployment dropped to almost 4%, gas prices fell, stocks went up, and it was that way for the better part of his years. Donald Trump has come in and given us economic polices that are short sighted, but are working on the short term.

57 2018-07-30 23:28:39 Well, I'd argue it's not yours.
The tax cuts for people go away.
They stay if you're a corp. 
All they're doing is buying back stocks.
A measly "tax cut" (& I mean measly) does nothing to help w/increasing costs everywhere else.
My 401 shows not much. And I bet it crashes soon.

60 2018-07-30 23:25:32 As FANG stocks drop,  leveraged players may receive margin calls.   To meet these calls,  they may have to sell whatever stocks they can.   Since FANG investors tend to invest in a combination of #FANG stocks,  expect a major drop in one to cause others to drop. #StockMarket #FB

68 2018-07-30 23:23:05 I feel like the theory imagines that stocks are purely devices for speculation. You buy a stock for the purpose of selling it at a higher price, not because there’s intrinsic value based on present value of future cash flows. By that reckoning, the proposal has an internal logic
69 2018-07-30 23:22:41 I have stocks, emergency funds, 2 everyday savings, and a 401K. Working on my IRA now

77 2018-07-30 23:15:41 ok does anybody know how to buy stocks? Moviepass is trading at $.80 a share and I want to buy like 50 shares
78 2018-07-30 23:14:17 on SEC website and the most recent writting on “penny stocks” or low priced securities was in 2013.  No info from Merrill...   when advisors inexperienced with low priced stox tell clients they need to sell by 9/30..... & put in a market order.  significant dislocation possible
79 2018-07-30 23:12:58 $bioaq what a bounce today! That was one of the craziest opens I've ever experienced. Not going to lie I was shocked in that drop under $0.01. Was able to pick up a few shares for a nice move to EOD. Was down 3k on the trade but managed to salvage it by keeping calm #stocks
80 2018-07-30 23:11:55 Forex u pay only difference bat prices just like option in stocks.reality is not 5 trillion a day.
81 2018-07-30 23:11:48 Not to worry.  People can't help themselves when it comes to Social Media. See what I mean...  I'm even doing it right now. The stocks will rebound. Does anybody really think FB, LinkedIn,  and Twitter will ever go belly up? Buy on the dip.
82 2018-07-30 23:11:36 They should boot out Facebook for Tesla.

122 2018-07-30 22:51:59 You are making us laughing stocks. Border  wall unnecessary. One of your companies must be bidding on it. Border security important. Think countries must be cringing at you separating parents and children. What about the alleged sexual abuse of the children.

124 2018-07-30 22:50:52 I love how stocks can go up 250% over a year or two, but sell off 1-5% and you think they are ridiculously cheap. Silliness out there.
125 2018-07-30 22:50:48 ... Eschewed Tech completely and felt like a stock market genius as my Healthcare, Defense and Consumer Staples stocks soared while market went down. It was really kind of just lucky to have those investment opportunities. I don't think value will ever get that cheap.

129 2018-07-30 22:50:05 Indexing capital gains to inflation would be insane. The
current low rate on gains is sufficient to attract investment.
Remember gains accumulate tax free until stock is sold.
That's how Buffet became a $$$$billionaire. Margin holdings to buy new stocks is huge leverage!

132 2018-07-30 22:48:26 So yeah.... shout out to my stocks though for going up like a crescendo
133 2018-07-30 22:47:49 Lol dick riding the contra. Do you know how many stocks he's suggested that have done very well???? No you just like to paint the negative aspects as it fits ur narrative.
134 2018-07-30 22:47:20 If Takeuchi Miyu don't make it in the final line up...I will pull out my stocks in MNET....

135 2018-07-30 22:46:46 The avg household is only making 1000 more than they made 10 years ago while the dow Jones has doubled in value in the last 10 years. Stocks do not accurately indicate economic strength by any means
136 2018-07-30 22:45:52 Now all these expert analysts are warning about FANG stocks after they upgraded $NFLX 10 days straight before earnings.....#logic
137 2018-07-30 22:45:25 I do think we will see a comeback... but will it hold? That is the only real question. Same deal for all these stocks.
138 2018-07-30 22:44:42 Investing in stocks is not an end all be all to become a millionaire. If so, it wouldnt be companies in charge of managing other people’s money, they would be rich off their own capital. It is a gamble. Just because you learn stocks don’t mean you will be rich.
139 2018-07-30 22:44:05 Can you post your portfolio so we know what stocks to short

146 2018-07-30 22:40:24 Tech stocks might blow up due to valuations, but increasing technological advancements are here to stay. Tech won’t be down for long, humans aren’t remaining stagnant.

148 2018-07-30 22:40:18 Have to love guys on twitter saying "FANG" holders feeling bad.  "FANG" stocks up 50% last year and still over 20% this year.  Silly.  i don't own any, so i am allowed to feel bad! $goog $NFLX, $amzn $FB
149 2018-07-30 22:40:16 Not really in long term, specially when Holiday season starts. However, when you have a large firm believing that Nintendo stocks will go down, it makes a trend in the rest of the market. Nintendo just have to report nice big fat numbers to reverse it
150 2018-07-30 22:38:03 8 breakouts:$HABT (gap), $MCY (gap and 200-day MA). Two sub-$1. Penny stocks slowly reappearing?
151 2018-07-30 22:38:01 My ex who I was dating for 6 years traded stocks. Had her series 6, series 7, & other licenses . Just because YOU don’t know the gripe of someone in the field, don’t group me into that with you. It is no facet of an American system that is not set up against us.
152 2018-07-30 22:37:37 Ofc 25 years of combat ops have resulted in a good chunk of it being scattered to the wind (I'll have to tell the story sometime of the Great Afghan LAMS Hunt of 2013), and there's also prepo stocks OCONUS so a decent amount of the AF's total stocks are currently forward deployed

155 2018-07-30 22:36:03 John you have much more knowledge in the investment universe. I know my own situation and invest to that. I understand the Media business because of my experience. I own media stocks. Other than that I trust what you say and thank you for your help!

157 2018-07-30 22:35:37 The GOP are a bunch of punks, they don't give a damn about our country; only support him because 401k & stocks are going up. TRUMP would sell the USA to Putin if he thought he could make some money from it.
158 2018-07-30 22:35:15 Your the only one scrambling.  Did you sell off all your stocks at election time
159 2018-07-30 22:33:55 Please do. Is this legal? And please report about Russia liquidating American stocks in order to hurt our economy.
Should we be thinking of dumping stocks ?
160 2018-07-30 22:33:06 @EdRileyAugust I'm curious, I've watched Chris Kachers' videos on pocket pivots and buyable fap ups. How does one find a list of fundamentally strong and sound leading stocks as suggested in the video?
161 2018-07-30 22:31:30 Copies were retained until April 1940, but stocks were then pulped as part of the Paper Salvage campaign.  The remainder of the campaign was cancelled in October 1939 following criticism of its cost and impact - and its patronising and divisive tone.
162 2018-07-30 22:31:26 Number of leading stocks today: 15 $SPY $QQQ $FB $GOOG $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL #DailyStkLeaderCount

164 2018-07-30 22:31:21 After watching this China Hustle video, it is 100% clear to me that the next spot (it may not be a large) will be Canada and Canadian listed stocks merging into US companies.
165 2018-07-30 22:31:18 @ByronBernstein What is the app/website you use to buy and trade stocks and invest?

170 2018-07-30 22:28:40 I wonder if anyone trading stocks at GS uses analyst opinions.. maybe they just put them in a seperate building?
171 2018-07-30 22:28:18 They are buying back stocks, not giving raises. Facts remains despite all the Republican lies.

178 2018-07-30 22:20:40 Haha, have you ever invested in stocks or real estate? Crypto is like a sprinter. Speed bursts, with in between fall-back and rest periods. Only to go for another sprint. So far in this short history. No reason to believe it's not going to do this again & again until mature state

182 2018-07-30 22:18:36 All those corporations that got their tax break and bought there stocks back didn't go down to the workers or to upgrade factories.just the big boys got any money out of it. I'm sure part of it found its way into trumps businesses.
183 2018-07-30 22:18:26 $AKS always seems to go down after earnings.

187 2018-07-30 22:14:14 V. Good explanation. The analyst said there was 2 much money invested in Nintendo long stocks (buy low sell high, the opposite of a short), so this is an attempt from this company to seize an opportunity 2 set up a massive short so even the smallest downturns create huge profits

190 2018-07-30 22:13:55 Haven’t watched Keith but there is a serious point: The bad weather this year means famers yeilds are seriously down, meaning we will have to import food stuffs. Most of which will come from Europe so Let’s just hope the delay at customs is less that the stocks of wheat we have.
191 2018-07-30 22:12:34 I smell something Fishy ,Trump's. Rally Soon Stocks are heading 
192 2018-07-30 22:12:34 If I had a nickel for every time this week someone-with no stocks- cited the stock market increase as if it would benefit them personally then I would have enough money to actually buy stocks
193 2018-07-30 22:11:54 @jack You are the biggest creep to walk the earth. I'm glad that your stocks are taking a fall. What comes around goes around. Stop bullying the conservatives. You will pay for it in the end. #mondaymotivation #MAGA
194 2018-07-30 22:11:20 These 3 men own stocks of big corporations which not only do music but other businesses as well. This is not the matter which group is currently big or not. Try read SM Wikipedia page you will know why they are so big.

197 2018-07-30 22:10:51 I seriously do not understand why stock buybacks are not a bigger deal in this country since executive compensation is in stocks.

203 2018-07-30 22:05:23 Think mkt is disconnecting a bit from CNY -weakness equal total risk off...Asean stocks, especially likes of Thailand, INdo etc have been performing pretty well - sentiment very much like start of 2016 when you couldnt give these mkts away
204 2018-07-30 22:04:48 You clearly don’t trade single name stocks.
205 2018-07-30 22:04:44 Nice....
206 2018-07-30 22:03:58 The exact same thing happened to me. I had to create a second backup account after they shut mine dow. This is censoring pure and simple. I hope their stocks continue to fall until they realize we are not going to be silenced.
207 2018-07-30 22:03:20 $AAPL will most likely going to fall after the earnings call as they don’t seem to have any innovative product or new devices lined up. In the wake of recent after earning disasters, it seems pretty probably that AAPL may follow NFT stocks.
208 2018-07-30 22:03:08 Stocks and enormous stock buybacks for CEOs show the beneficiaries are the wealthy. Top 1% own more wealth than bottom 90%. Your base is not benefitting!
209 2018-07-30 22:01:16 V. interesting - especially the barbell part. 2 questions:
1 How often do you calculate lookback to potentially re-adjust allocation?  Every month?
2 Would this model be applicable to trading a basket of individual large cap liquid stocks?

216 2018-07-30 21:58:17 Twitter and Facebook stocks are falling fast! Wtf... How can I short the stock market? I foresee a crash similar to the 2008
217 2018-07-30 21:58:01 I remember when airlines were like $99 each way and not just Jet Blue types. No wonder stocks are down! Good luck in your quest.

219 2018-07-30 21:57:34 THIS!! And people too poor to buy stocks don’t understand what is happening. They think they are the big benefactors of the tax cuts.

263 2018-07-30 21:28:55 I read a recent report and their is black outage for the service and no confirmation yet for it being back up and already stocks fell $1 per share as low as 98c. Their parent company Helios and Matheson Analytics (HMNY) plunged by a rather bleak 60%. Jeeze!

269 2018-07-30 21:26:20 FANG stocks are becoming risky for the long-term. The 50/80 rule. When a secular leader makes a major top, there's a 50% chance it will drop 80% and an 80% chance it will drop 50%

272 2018-07-30 21:24:56 @inittowinit007 Most of Congress have become rich from insider trading. With holding a paycheck wont hurt the entrenched crooks. Take away congressional perks. They should have to divest of all stocks and companies like they made Trump do. Go on Obama care.
273 2018-07-30 21:23:54 you need a margin account i guess!!
274 2018-07-30 21:23:32 The investor's class action from 2015 for causing a 40% slide in stocks just got the go ahead last week.

Jack sounds like he'll be one of them.
275 2018-07-30 21:23:27 Oh wait I think American people own stocks , correct me if I’m wrong but if corps buy backs stocks , the price raises of that stock and retirees and 401k go up , who would of thought #maga

277 2018-07-30 21:22:24 Everything playing as expected imho. Perhaps Gold fell a little further but stocks, bonds, FX, Fed, global CBs, politics... all going to plan at the moment. 'When' the crash does come, that'll truly shake things up for the foreseeable future.
278 2018-07-30 21:22:10 Buying lithium stocks right now when everything is crashing and burning is NOT easy! Ppl are scared, many sitting on HUGE losses, and almost too demoralized to even look at the screen anymore.

293 2018-07-30 21:15:39 Netflix charts looks like one of those they talk about in the trading textbooks. Those fad stocks. Reminds me of Crocs back in the day on the chart. The difference is it really doesn't have competition right now. Players are starting to enter the market but they aren't
294 2018-07-30 21:13:33 ok now my Toyota stock going up when all my other stocks (except AMD) went down, makes a ton of sense. This could be a HUGE thing.

304 2018-07-30 21:09:36 BRK does invest in some stocks, and some BRK companies like GIEKO invest a substantial amount in stocks, but the essence of BRK is to buy and hold a diverse portfolio of private companies. It’s basically a conglomerate.

384 2018-07-30 20:38:02 But they won’t contend next year. Just like they aren’t contending this year. Same way they didn’t contend last year. And until something gives with this owenship or they’re removed completely, the Mets will continue to be one of the biggest laughing stocks in all of sports
385 2018-07-30 20:37:49 I must have been hiding under a rock because this is the first time I've seen the term "glamour stocks".
386 2018-07-30 20:37:45 Some people choose happiness over uncertainty because its easier, less risk or comfortable. Uncertainty tho is the only way to get to your full potential. Always look to learn more and try new things, dont limit yourself to “simple”. #business #finance #MondayMotivation #stocks
387 2018-07-30 20:37:22 It's also worth noting that 85% of all stocks are owned by the top 1%. Most of the 4.1% this quarter can be attributed to stock buy-backs & foreign countries stocking up on commodities before tariffs take effect. Next quarter will be dire.
388 2018-07-30 20:36:30 it seems like all the other big tech stocks are taking a bit of a hit alongside the giant drops from twitter and facebook. 

i mean the market economy is completely irrational so anything might happen short term but that long fabled Tech Bubble Burst I think is imminent
389 2018-07-30 20:35:14 Funny some "real talk" shorters quiet on Fri after $AWX loss $50K $100K+ & only posted today's win (part of it back)

Don't hate on guy run-up $AWX cuz it made us GREAT profits! Hate on your own bad shorting skills!

2 stocks doubled today $SSLJ & $MYND
Traded both for nice total
390 2018-07-30 20:34:47 These last 3 days have seen strong stocks go down for no reason or any major news event. These liquidity events are of short duration and mean reversion to previous price levels are more than likely.
391 2018-07-30 20:34:06 Idk why people keep mentioning fundamentals when talking about micro cap and small cap stocks. It's a given that's they're going to be shitty . Get over it . That's not why we're here . Majority Americans suck at managing finance .

395 2018-07-30 20:33:23 ...if stocks are imploding (properly), it implies lower for longer monetary policy, which ripples out to credit...eventually. Weak hands and worst credits will take a hit, but the move will gravitate towards monetary policy reaction functions.
396 2018-07-30 20:33:20 Are you saying that people on shareholders boards are paying the same price for stocks as you or I?...I call this insider trading-Not to be confused with trading on inside information 
397 2018-07-30 20:33:08 I see a giant head and shoulder top.    Pointing lower.   I would sell many stocks that seem to be developing this pattern.  BA stands out as well.
398 2018-07-30 20:32:57 Texas Roadhouse $TXRH reports 5.7% same-store sales growth and the stock crashes 13%. We're at a stage where market expectations are so absurd for many stocks, that even the best-run companies in the US can't meet them.

400 2018-07-30 20:32:10 @FishwickDavid how do you start investing in stocks, shares or future tech without knowing a stockbroker ? 
401 2018-07-30 20:31:59 365 stocks were down 4%+ on Friday...it will be interesting to see how many ended today down the same.

405 2018-07-30 20:30:44 Many of the stocks that were leaders in the most recent rally now have some very ugly charts! Short term swing traders should be cautious here if not in cash
406 2018-07-30 20:30:20 Wow. Feel like we're at a stage where built-in expectations for so many stocks are impossibly high. I see 5.7% SSS growth for a dine-in restaurant chain right now and I think that's pretty good. But the market wanted 6.2%.
407 2018-07-30 20:29:43 Well...the relative performance of both is incomparable. Stocks blown credit out of the water so stretched valuations will be (should be) a stocks narrative before it becomes a credit narrative. The vol upside for stocks just looks way more than credit right now...
408 2018-07-30 20:29:37 that's not really an attack, the attack is when almost young Putin in 2006 with armed soldiers comes to the TV station and arrest everyone, forcing to sell all stocks to state=in result the Russia is pristine clean country from any private media, everyone work on government
409 2018-07-30 20:29:34 It’s a great stock , but it’s gone sideways since February and seems to have run out of gas. Big entry point too, you are buying at the top. If you hold it, keep holding - if you don’t, well, there’s more potential in other tech stocks, especially AMD due to 7nm leadership.

415 2018-07-30 20:27:04 Realistically what can Powell turn Dovish on? Stocks (FB/Netflix drops)? Housing bad (existing/new sales)? But there are also others who have recently turned more dovish and their language will be emphasized this week. Think that is our best bet for $GOLD

425 2018-07-30 20:25:25 Stocks retreat. The Dow closed at 25,306.83, down 144.23 (-0.57%). Nasdaq -1.39%. S&P -0.58%.
426 2018-07-30 20:24:38 but david we also never had two mega stocks like FB, NFLX crash by 20 percent.  If money is leaving FANG's and FANG's contribute 25 percent to the index than index should drop significantly. isnt it ?

432 2018-07-30 20:22:51 Review: Last week markets and stocks started acting weak and whippy. This caused us to stop buying, lock in gains, and limit losses. We listened and avoided most of this decline. We'll watch closely and let the markets guide us. #stocks

443 2018-07-30 20:20:35 @IBD_KShreve Ken,  can you clarify how Leaderboard has a cash position.   I thought Leaderboard was only a list of stocks.  Are you referring to FFTY ?
444 2018-07-30 20:20:32 Cuz you assume that trading stocks is based upon an equal playing field after I pointed out insider trading...so I'm assuming your doubt is race based ignorance

449 2018-07-30 20:17:34 European shares retreated from a 6-week high on Monday as industrials & tech stocks slipped & disappointing earnings.
450 2018-07-30 20:17:31 Watching the plains pass by, we talk about stocks.
451 2018-07-30 20:17:10 pro tip: the best trades I'm seeing right now are not in stocks, they're in options, forex and crypto.
452 2018-07-30 20:16:57 Stash app allows you to buy fractionalized stocks. So if you only wanted to buy $5 worth of Amazon stock you could do that, instead of buying a whole stock for $1750+
453 2018-07-30 20:16:46 Doesn't matter what one purchased a product for - it's a matter of demand for such product now. Supply & Demand, plus many quality RP arms are no longer avail. Just like stocks, buy low, sell high. Can the Nats pull off the flip, that remains to be seen.
454 2018-07-30 20:16:40 the biggest lingering question is just how far president Trump, who has made his displeasure with falling stocks clear on numerous occasions, go before launching another attack on the Fed and demanding an end to tightening, if not lower rates and, eventually, QE?
455 2018-07-30 20:16:08 Question: Can #FAANG stocks continue to grow revenues at their historical rates?

@hussmanjp answers by referring to the notion of “logistic growth” – which is the tendency of growth to slow as the size of a system approaches its mature “carrying capacity.”
456 2018-07-30 20:15:57 is it worse than most media takes on mid-cap stocks? At a minimum she is funny.
457 2018-07-30 20:15:51 The core I'm getting at, is how can anyone (ethically) run a "company that invests in stocks" and charge users for investing in it, if they believe that a low cost index fund is superior.  Maybe I'm just not understanding...
458 2018-07-30 20:15:51 @OptionsHawk might need your program, single worst day I've ever had buying tech stocks prematurely.
459 2018-07-30 20:15:44 World stocks fall: US -.6%; Europe -.3%.  With no reason to rise US stocks had their 3ird day of losses. Tech fall starting to shake investors' confidence. More worrisome is lack of pricing in of trade war. Could cause short-term market shock. In any case expect rising volatility

I was told no new stocks until 2nd week of August.

I am so stressed about this whole ordeal.

It might sound like a first world prob to some but almost all my daily stuff are phone-dependent.
463 2018-07-30 20:14:49 People/companies don’t ‘hoard wealth’. A persons/companies net worth is reinvested into other companies/stocks/projects/etc. Besides no one forced you to buy Apple products or buy from amazon to make them all that money
464 2018-07-30 20:14:47 Aleafia one of the weakest pot stocks in Canada. Many directors and less quality!!!!
465 2018-07-30 20:14:22 He's right: as a reminder, the vast majority of the stocks most widely held by the hedge fund community are tech names.
466 2018-07-30 20:14:12 no one ver made a dime chasing wildly overpriced stocks just believing another moron will buy higher which has been cramer strategy all along

470 2018-07-30 20:11:20 You are probably right given buy the dip is strong.  But I feel it’s just the beginning.  AMZN stocks reaction to its awesome earnings is my tell.  Overowned I think
471 2018-07-30 20:11:04 3 stocks allows better consistency imo. also looks faster.
472 2018-07-30 20:10:55 Chip stocks well-represented among the handful of tech names that stayed green today. $AMD, $INTC, $CRUS, $AVGO, $NXPI and $MXIM among them.
473 2018-07-30 20:10:48 You can’t go into investing with the mindset that every day will be profitable, especially in the OTC. There are tough days just like any other job. Just keep your head up and move on to the next if things don’t work out. See you all in the AM  #Investing #Stocks #Market

483 2018-07-30 20:05:55 right time to buy tech stocks.. deeps everywhere, Nasdaq closing down 1.4%
484 2018-07-30 20:05:51 My gambling did not work out with $TWTR: Lost a solid 8%. I am OVER trading. I also am focusing on a long list of stocks to see which one of them works rather than focusing on a FEW high-quality stocks.....continued
485 2018-07-30 20:05:15 Oh yeah I’m keeping notes on who to boycott or stocks to divest or funds to avoid.
486 2018-07-30 20:05:15 #Microcap Truth #9: Index funds are poor vehicles to get exposure to #microcaps because they screen out the most illiquid stocks which may offer higher expected returns.
487 2018-07-30 20:04:50 Maybe you just need to review your strategy. Chasing stocks higher ends up being painful when they miss & correct, especially the ones with low/no earnings and/or growth. Take profits after a good run, buy great companies after a nice selloff/consolidation.
488 2018-07-30 20:03:35 Years ago, over a decade ago, I had this mindset, "The markets open! I need to do something." Cost me capital. Financial capital. Emotional capital. Both are Priceless. #stocks

497 2018-07-30 20:00:31 Ah, thanks. As in bear/bull markets? (I’ve been to Wall Street). I have no stocks or shares so the accusation is bull.
498 2018-07-30 20:00:18 Of the FANG stocks, Facebook $FB was the only one to rally back significantly this afternoon, up $5 off its lows.  It led the way lower, will it lead a short-term bounce?

548 2018-07-30 19:37:30 They should all be put into stocks and let people throw all kinds of unmentionable at them to let them know how it feels to be so humiliated, upset and probably downright petrified the poor lady was.
549 2018-07-30 19:37:10 Makes sense, off loading a large number of stocks would drive any stocks down. My guess he made quite a bit of money doing it and most likely bought them back during the dip.
550 2018-07-30 19:35:15 If these stocks are done for, topped, etc, then Mr Market is in serious trouble.  I don't think that's the case but agree these (and lots of other high growth names) are still very extended above major support and need time to reload.
551 2018-07-30 19:35:13 Dude that’s not all that bad. I was messing with super volatile stocks and I’d drop hundreds to thousands of percents a day haha. Roght now I’m looking into what the next crypto is going to be

554 2018-07-30 19:33:09 Stocks are overvalued while consumer and housing debt is rising. Tax cuts provided a recent jump but there isn’t much room to grow. It may not be as severe, but there’s little room left to go up
555 2018-07-30 19:32:58 I'm just saying, if you bought 100 shares of $AMD in 2014 instead of a 1 pair of J's, it'd be worth $2k, and can be unloaded with a click of a button. Also, stocks aren't limited, theres no hustle and jig to get a share like kicks that actually flip.
556 2018-07-30 19:32:43 Do you make reservations?
557 2018-07-30 19:32:05 Lol,  then layer today or tomorrow we will hear about their stocks "mysteriously" falling again. Someday it may fall so hard A&E  couldn't save them.
558 2018-07-30 19:32:02 Several worrisome issues 1). Rapid Chinese debt buildup.  As that has been the engine of world growth, could lead to decking prices for financial assets.  2).  Normalizing rates can lead to bear market in asset prices (R/E, Stocks, bonds, a la 1994).  3). Eurozone instability.

561 2018-07-30 19:31:28 I see everyone talking about the big tech sell off in a negative way, this is good for active long term investors - it keeps the game healthy and controlled.

Get the short sellers out & keep the substantial investors in the stocks, by alllowing them to buy more shares for cheap.

563 2018-07-30 19:31:14 Do you have some information about actual increase in demand, because this price increase seems to be caused by supply shock by big mining companies? If these penny stocks are only ore exploration companies, then they could be quite far from actual production.
564 2018-07-30 19:31:03 Sure. Because you can’t rely on it or touch any of it without a penalty. Same reason I don’t count my stocks or crypto in the total as well.

768 2018-07-30 18:13:12 When insiders buy on penny stocks, I use the 30 day rule for news streaming/ company MOMO. $cybx.c July 13 was last buy! 30 days is right during the CBOE ETF news. #blockchain #crypto #cybersecurity
769 2018-07-30 18:12:17 3 stocks because the game is fast, has higher damage output than smash 4, and edgeguarding/juggling will be more lethal. I feel as the game progresses it will quickly show that stocks can drop at a faster rate than smash 4 and 3 stocks can help balance that
770 2018-07-30 18:11:53 Gotcha. There’s been plenty of dips in gamers $EA $ATVI $TTwO $BaBa $TCEHY $V $NfLX $FB $AMzN. Remember the best stocks tend to get max oversold around 50rsi in bulls. To each his own, this is gift-I’m not a day trader so I don’t care if I’m a bit early I just buy brands on sale
771 2018-07-30 18:11:20 The Americans could have supplied it....they had verifiably taken custody of Syrian chemical weapons stocks prior to the Khan Sheikhoun incident...I'm curious to know by what logic you are able to exclude such a possibility...I won't hold my breath for an answer..
772 2018-07-30 18:10:48 Although, I dont reccomend stocks for the average investor

774 2018-07-30 18:10:30 Agree. No stocks is a big mistake. I probably have 20x stock dollars over crypto dollars.
775 2018-07-30 18:10:28 We should at least start with 3 stocks then go from there
776 2018-07-30 18:10:26 Yes! Thanks
777 2018-07-30 18:09:58 Tech-minded rookies who bought lithium juniors are learning that the market does not price mining stocks on multiples of sales.
778 2018-07-30 18:09:50 As a cyclist in NL, I'd wonder whether there's any evidence for that trend now actually re-reversing, given that e-bikes now constitute a large fraction of new bike sales. I joke that one should buy stocks in lithium & futures in health care here 
779 2018-07-30 18:09:48 The game is much more aggressively minded, meaning stocks are gonna go a lot faster. Shorter games aren't a bad thing, but more stocks means it's easier to be consistent and harder to make upsets, which makes the upsets that do happen more impactful.
780 2018-07-30 18:09:13 You're making an awful lot of assumptions here, Teri. Time reported that 10% of Americans own 84% of stocks. More people own their home than stocks. I don't resent wealth. I resent that wealth is concentrated and the high/low gap is widening.
781 2018-07-30 18:09:09 Lloyd's still waiting for a final rule on bump stocks from the Trump admin. (It's been 10 months since 58 people were killed in Las Vegas by a shooter using a bump stock.)
782 2018-07-30 18:08:33 The flow of the game feels faster but I've not actually had the chance to play myself. 3 stocks seems fine at the moment, but that's purely from a spectator point of view.
783 2018-07-30 18:08:17 He also said we were the laughing stocks of the world. I cant argue there but it's for different reasons than what he said.

789 2018-07-30 18:05:41 [FACEBOOK] One of the contributors, according 2 @THErealDVORAK, 2 stocks plunging 4 @facebook is that there is no way for the public/press to communicate with them. They don't respond to customer/press/media--makes fighting fires (negative stories) impossible and exacerbate them.

796 2018-07-30 18:02:27 For now, then you’ll see the reverse happen. I’m not knocking AMD, just the manipulation that happens with these two particular stocks. The trolls of AMD just tend to be more fair weather in when they tweet, however.
797 2018-07-30 18:01:21 Also the tax on trade that I’m talking about is 50 cents for every hundred dollars traded on the stock market (0.5%). I think if you’re trading stocks, you definitely have that amount of money.

1036 2018-07-30 16:34:25 Other standout areas today in the green:

Grains, insurance stocks, pharmaceuticals, transports, & homebuilders.

1043 2018-07-30 16:29:53 Nice breakout $ADMA  "A" momentum grade. No current position. Tech stocks weak again today. Don't forget they hit all time high Wed.
1044 2018-07-30 16:28:55 Trust you me we do not have enough Kenyans to demo for 3 days continuously. Most do not have enough food stocks to last 3 days. The few who can do that are very secure with their tribal hatred. They hate even on the poor amongst them. So, not yet revolution
1045 2018-07-30 16:28:14 @Stockengg  One more query bhai. As per the trading plan of squeeze strategy, you place both buy and sell orders (AMO) of selected stocks , to trade in direction of breakout

1047 2018-07-30 16:27:20 @HalftimeReport could the FANG downturn be a result of the buy backs being halted during reporting season and the stocks will resume upward momentum (or at least stop the fall) once the buy backs resume ?
1048 2018-07-30 16:26:44 These scumbag investment banks, who were bailed out in 2008, should be refilling these pension funds with the record profits they are now making. Most will buy back stocks and stuff the pockets of their CEO’s. Dodd-Frank Act was repealed just for this purpose. #ThanksTrumpGOP

1065 2018-07-30 16:22:08 Most of the best Growth Stocks seldom trade at low P/ E. If you avoid stocks just because the P/E or share price seems too high, you will miss out on many of the biggest market movers.

1067 2018-07-30 16:21:28 #Trading Rules

1. Buying a weak #stock is like betting on a slow horse. It is retarded.
2. Stocks are only cheap if they are going higher after you buy them.
3. Never trust a person more than the market. People lie, the #market does not.

1079 2018-07-30 16:16:59 Yes, but the point is that if the leaders are in retreat the single stocks that do well are going against the grain and usually get crushed as well.  That's the reason I was selling my stocks like $MDB $YEXT and $ROKU on Friday despite the fact that they were acting well.

1131 2018-07-30 15:56:44 Yes. It. Is. Same as the sovereign funds that were investigated for shorting airline stocks on 9/11. If Russia profits from the sale of those treasuries due to something Trump illegally whispered to Putin about his policy that’s exactly what insider trading is.

1694 2018-07-30 12:29:17 Hi Dan, we have had some very welcome heavy downpours recently, we still need these temporary restrictions. We estimate some parts of our region need a good few weeks of rain like this / that before we can be confident we have the reservoir stocks we need to see us through...

1697 2018-07-30 12:27:26 Thoughts: 90% of the mining stocks are dog shit, and you would probably be better off just buying the metal itself. Only pick companies with good/experienced management who have skin in the game and try to go for big quality projects that does not require $1,300+ gold to work.
1698 2018-07-30 12:26:48 I have 500 stocks on my primary watch list and only a handful look bullish.  Of course, I'm also consistently surprised by waiting a few days often provides many bullish setups.  With that said, I think defense and caution is the game plan for the coming weeks.

Pause should not be left on. But if it is left on then in that case you are forced to forfeit one of your stocks (so you still beat the game). Depending from the ruleset it can also lead into game loss for you or DQing both players for not playing with correct rules.

1920 2018-07-30 08:25:14 A number of top-rated software stocks report earnings this week, including Paycom (PAYC), Qualys (QLYS), Fortinet (FTNT), Mindbody (MB), Hubspot (HUBS), Tableau Software (DATA), Shopify (SHOP). Paycom and Fortinet are IBD 50 stocks.
1921 2018-07-30 08:24:40 Out performance of high P/E Growth stocks versus low P/E Value stocks is close to a 20-year extreme. This is shown in the chart below and was last seen at the peak of the dot-com boom in 1999. Since 2007 growth has been on a tear. Now (maybe) is good time to tilt to Value.

1923 2018-07-30 08:20:29 First: Insider Trading is when an insider uses non-public information about their company to gain an advantage in the stock market. It's not illegal for an "insider" to acquire (purchase) or dispose of (sell) stocks in their own company. They are just required to publicly report
1924 2018-07-30 08:18:15 Or maybe everyone’s focus is on index stocks today
1925 2018-07-30 08:18:07 Never invest in stocks blindly.  You might be lucky some times,  but not always.  Do your home work and invest in a stock only if you see its strategies pay off to be a clear winner
1926 2018-07-30 08:16:54 never seen such narrow market,  everything going down and ten stocks going up for new highs,and have never seen the broader markets catching up after such narrowness,well it could be different this timewell i guess markets would finally turn down when our dear RS gets bullish

2029 2018-07-30 06:48:18 I wouldn't argue that. Like I said I see the financials, I see a LOT of warning signs, and $TSLA isn't looking good, man. But I've got no horse in the race, I don't get emotional over stocks. It is what it is & if they can't raise $2 billion by end of Q3 - over. It's daunting!

2033 2018-07-30 06:44:28 Thanks for sharing. It must be the simplest I ever heard of. Do you have a maximum number stocks you hold? EMA or SMA?
2034 2018-07-30 06:39:35 I never know which stocks will behave the way I want, or for how long, but my goal with all of them is exactly the same. Buy when price is just above the 200d line, and hold as long as it stays above that line. It’s that simple.
2035 2018-07-30 06:39:07 There was a time when Hindustan budget was finalized in Bombay House in Indira Gandhi time on how much excise duty will be hiked so that businessmen stocks go up overnight.  That culture is not now there.  You cannot blame others after sowing the crops of thorns.

2127 2018-07-30 04:47:13 I have learned. Just asking a simple question. Pumping stocks is far from holding hands. It's misleading the gulable and could cause people to loose a lot of  and cause financial ruin to families. It's easy to say due your DD just so there is no accountability for pumping.
2128 2018-07-30 04:46:12 where can we find the full 20 list of stocks?
2129 2018-07-30 04:45:05 Agreed. I just hate it that literally every other 1st round QB is signed yet here we are now 4 days into Jets training camp and Darnold still isn’t signed.. There’s many reasons why Jets are laughing stocks of the league. This doesn’t help that narrative..
2130 2018-07-30 04:43:12 Technically, no.  A share in a REIT is Equity in a company that owns real estate.   The company pays dividends but has a heavy load of fees and expenses.  REIT stocks experience market volatility.   Direct ownership of a fraction of a specific asset is different.

2171 2018-07-30 03:59:14 @traecrowder Serious question. Would you be surprised to find that Trump shorted USA stocks and sacrificed us to profit from it? I wouldn't.
2172 2018-07-30 03:57:32 Or perhaps people should spend less on consumer goods and more on buying stocks 
2173 2018-07-30 03:54:57 Those dividends are going largely to retirement funds for workers - and it gets used to buy more stocks. I do not see why you have a problem with that.
2174 2018-07-30 03:54:10 The only people that believe, and it is a belief, that housing affordability has much to do with regulations and zoning are ideology pumps like Heritage, AEI and Brookings. Housing is a financial asset that people live in. Find rental yield, compare to stocks and bonds. 1/2
2175 2018-07-30 03:53:05 So, the #FlintWaterCrisis has been an ongoing source of profit for the bottled water industry? Time to check who has ties/stocks/relations to these bottled water brands that are constantly being distributed to the residents of #Flint instead of the crisis being fixed.

2200 2018-07-30 03:30:56 @dimeshpatel203  Hi Brother good morning, Is there any source from where i can download Historical data for last 1 year, or 1 month or say of week, of all stocks in one excel file?
2201 2018-07-30 03:30:53 What are your thoughts on Pot stocks?
2202 2018-07-30 03:30:30 No
I'm saying all those who make less than 75,000 will pay taxes when our tax cuts expire so corporations who bought back stocks and foreign investors got a bigger tax cut
With rising core inflation our meager tax cut disappears
2203 2018-07-30 03:29:06 Factually wrong but enjoy your propaganda.  Wages are down, most companies use d the tax cuts to buy back stocks.  Might be good for the company and stockholders but not for workers.  Obama did much better but you just keep buying Trumps lies.
2204 2018-07-30 03:27:06 FB let’s trophy hunters post their kills of beautiful innocent wildlife and they support this better wake up yr stocks are dropping
2205 2018-07-30 03:26:58 I am middle class and I have stocks
2206 2018-07-30 03:26:50 You buy stocks in companies then push policies to drive up your stocks.  Perhaps you’re aware of how much wealth Mitch McConnell has accrued?  Kind of hard to do in a short time on his salary.  Just one example.
BTW this information is publicly available.
2207 2018-07-30 03:26:17 You're just reciting the same thing over & over again. Suppliers are bound to have a corporate policy at present to say "All should be fine". All businesses will say that in this situation. But when stocks start running low, they'll absolve themselves of any responsibility.
2208 2018-07-30 03:26:09 Me dreaming of inversion stocks after this tweet
2209 2018-07-30 03:25:30 Lower taxes for the rich were never meant to help low income families, and they haven't. NK has NOT gotten rid of its nukes; talking? We'll see. No one in my income level has stocks, but Dow Jones has been up and down. Companies are still moving out, police always had support.
2210 2018-07-30 03:25:29 U.S. Market

2216 2018-07-30 03:22:16 Are lower taxes helping low income families? Is NK getting rid of their nukes and willing to talk?  Are minorities getting more jobs?  Are stocks still up?  Are less companies moving to other countries?  Is law enforcement getting more support?  You think its all bad?
2217 2018-07-30 03:22:12 If FANG cant lead then all growth stocks are in trouble imo. These next few months will test our patience if they go into deeper corrections.

2226 2018-07-30 03:15:33 I just read the article. I think 13% seems fairly reasonable considering the circumstances of the last 5 years. Many tech stocks came into their own in terms of dividends (ie $AAPL, $MSFT, $CSCO) plus many large banks that cut divs to 5 cents during the crisis had large increases

2239 2018-07-30 03:04:51 if it was me at 70, i would own all stocks that i liked and maybe 2 years worth of cash, and i would take much less than 4% withdrawal rate.  i would try to live off dividends.   most people want to withdraw as much as possible without running out. i think rmd’s in 401ks are 5-6%
2240 2018-07-30 03:04:03 Don't need to watch your videos! I did MIGHT! MIGHT! MIGHT NICE! last week! And Friday was a day for the ages. Wasn't expecting anything to to zero. called the UP Now calling the DOWN while they are buying Bullish positions as the stocks are going DOWN. Seeing both sides

2253 2018-07-30 02:54:13 Are you that dumb? You gave huge tax breaks to big corporations, already wealthy, and they used the money to buy their own stocks. They invested in themselves, not in workers' wages, job creation, America, economy or future. Just greed, plain & simple. Something U know all about!

2280 2018-07-30 02:26:00 2. They may really not like strategies phrased in terms of "reducing risk" because a) the stock market always went up eventually in their experience, and b) they believe they need investment returns from stocks to keep them going over another 30 years.

2299 2018-07-30 02:13:31 She doesn’t have a point, she’s lying. America enjoyed the longest stretch of economic and job growth in history under Obama, with stocks tripled. Didn’t help the Comrade though!
2300 2018-07-30 02:12:12 From today's ET newspaper "Though flows from high net worth individuals appear to have tapered off, retail flows are still going strong with systematic investment plans showing no signs of slowdown yet." 
Time to be cautious. Pick your stocks/funds carefully.

2324 2018-07-30 01:54:24 From a -traditional- value perspective, when a stock is above its intrinsic value, it becomes an speculation and not an investment. Of course that has change a little because it's become harder to find value stocks. Now its about an exceptional business at a reasonable price.

2339 2018-07-30 01:36:13 If I knew he was scheming, his set would be DQed from the event. If it truly was an accident and he was a good dude, he’d restart the game with his foe and be up only 1 stock. If he did it by accident and was a cheap ass, then I guess his foe would be down 2 stocks.

2341 2018-07-30 01:34:01 Actually, the effective rate of fire for an AR is only about 50 rounds a minute. A shooter needs time to acquire each target.  The gas system in a carbine can jam if the action isn’t allowed to cycle.  That is why bump stocks are not serious assets.

2350 2018-07-30 01:29:54 stocks are based off projected earnings... just saying.. may not be today but the future looks bright.  all the best to you
2351 2018-07-30 01:29:18 Hey. I don't take Trump or his rivals too seriously. But at least we are working and taxes are going down. Stocks doing pretty good. So American business is happy. Seniors have SS and other retirement money. We will muddle through. Just keep interest rates low for college kids.
2352 2018-07-30 01:29:06 Been telling that to crypto bulls and they look at me like I'm crazy. The difference is I'm trading stocks for a living from the comfort of my home. They are just dreaming of another get rich quick scheme.
2353 2018-07-30 01:27:36 He was both. Remember his response to the 2008 financial crisis when families across the country were losing their houses? He told Peter Mansbridge that it was “a great opportunity to buy stocks at lower prices”. What a leader. 
2354 2018-07-30 01:27:27 Oh that's a bit of a change .. a delay getting through customs as opposed to no Insulin at all ? You expect delays of years to get through customs ? Months ?  Weeks? days? You know we have NO stocks in the UK for more than a few days at a  time ? There is not time to stockpile ?
2355 2018-07-30 01:24:44 All of those stocks have been leaders since 2012 & GOOGL & AAPL from maybe 2004 that is a long time.
2356 2018-07-30 01:24:21 Can only appreciate getting to the top by going through the lows.  Whether its stocks, business and life
2357 2018-07-30 01:22:32 Trump has criticized everyone and everything, so let's not talk about that.
Now to the actions of Trump. Banks deregulated. Tariff for certain merchandise, not all. Give 12 billion tax dollars to subsidized lost of revenue. Stocks deregulated. 
Sanctions to a few countries. (1)

2362 2018-07-30 01:19:10 Why is it that people who work hard and earn income are taxed more than millionaires who trade stocks back and forth? Trump gives away billions of our money to the wealthiest and wages have dropped. It is time for the working class to wake up and vote them out of office.
2363 2018-07-30 01:18:42 Not any more...that was early last year. Also...the big tax cuts...?? The 1% is just investing back in their Own Stocks!!

But, the breakdown of some market leaders such as Facebook, Tweeter, Netflix, and to some extent Tesla warrant attention. Is there a shift in leadership out of some favorite tech stocks to the next generation techs?

2410 2018-07-30 00:34:53 FANG’s are likely topped out. Waterfall type action is possible.  10 tech stocks can cause global market dislocations. Let us see how this action unfolds
2411 2018-07-30 00:33:30 Don’t know many analysts who have been bullish cable stocks while being bullish big cap tech.  congrats on being one of the few to not let dominar narratives control analysis
2412 2018-07-30 00:31:05 Investing in stocks is an art, not a science, and people who’ve been trained to rigidly quantify everything have a big disadvantage. - Peter Lynch
2413 2018-07-30 00:30:42 My guess. Stocks and bonds are known as securities. Securities dealers know that when the value of stocks goes up the value of bonds go down and vice versa. 

Anyone who is confident that the stock market will increase in value will wisely move out of bonds.

2419 2018-07-30 00:27:18 There’s nothing wrong with taking the traditional route in investing, like stocks, bonds or mutual funds, they usually give 5-7% return which is better than nothing !!
2420 2018-07-30 00:26:21 You have a point, but so did new/early investors in the FANG stocks - and they were right. I’m just trying to make an honest assessment of the underlying tech. DISCLAIMER: DOES NOT APPLY TO ALL ALTS BY ANY MEANS

3-Open Pakistani Banks in US and all Western countries for easy money transfer
4-Invest in Solar energy projects and manufacture Solar Panel & Invertors and  other solar plant equipment  in Pakistan instead of importing solar
2424 2018-07-30 00:22:19 People saying you have to forfeit 2 stocks only works in 2 stock format.
Oh no.

2427 2018-07-30 00:19:37 Now what...for starters, keep $1M in the pot sector.  Put $1M in general stocks.  Put $1M in real estate.  Put $1M in bonds and gold.  Spend $1M on stuff over the next few years...keep $1M in the bank as a bare minimium.

2431 2018-07-30 00:17:22 Green back out on the @DIRTcarNE Pro Stocks @cms_speedway Jocelyn Roy leads but CD Beauchamp is there to challenge with Rock Aubin Guy Viens and Rich Crane
2432 2018-07-30 00:16:02 European stocks rose on Friday with their strongest weekly gain in more than four months, helped by an easing of fears over US tariffs and some solid company results
2433 2018-07-30 00:15:02 US stocks fell on Friday following disappointing results from Twitter and bellwethers including Exxon and Intel, while much-anticipated gross domestic product data showed economic growth remains relatively strong, if a shade below expectations.
2434 2018-07-30 00:14:55 Ditto! Don’t make us delete Twitter..we will and your stocks will crash. Free speech is Free speech. You can’t choose that for us..#ConservativesMatterToo
2435 2018-07-30 00:13:50 I’m with Art on this. Price is a symptom not the cause.  Market pays, disincentives storage. Incentivizes stocks from other places to move to the pricing point. People are looking at Brent only. They fail to to see that crude on water is still in backwardation relative to Padd3
2436 2018-07-30 00:10:42 Dont get defensive now,,, I was referring to your comparison between sports wager and stocks.  There are many more distinctions than similarities.  Your choice of words in a effort to get ppl to buy your package is even funnier than this platform.

2446 2018-07-30 00:00:17 Crystal ball.
The NSA will combat the hackers into our voting software, sans congressional support.
The dems will win. 
The overdue crash will happen because of grossly overinflated stocks from tax scam.
GOP will blame dems for it.
