40 2018-02-14 22:35:19 So the president wants to give everyone the #NativeAmerican experience of getting commodities.  Protect those "Gold bricks" and powdered milk.
41 2018-02-14 22:35:05 One thing, however, is clear — Nature does not produce on the one side owners of money or commodities, and on the other men possessing nothing but their own labour-power.
42 2018-02-14 22:34:27 The question why this free labourer confronts him in the market, has no interest for the owner of money, who regards the labour-market as a branch of the general market for commodities.
43 2018-02-14 22:33:12 In a society where all products assume the form of commodities, these commodities must be sold after they have been produced, it is only after their sale that they can serve in satisfying the requirements of their producer.
44 2018-02-14 22:32:35 In order that a man may be able to sell commodities other than labour-power, he must of course have the means of produc- tion, as raw material, implements, &c.

@Kora_Network
48 2018-02-14 22:18:50 He knows that when a long period of time is taken, commodities are sold neither over nor under, but at their average price.
49 2018-02-14 22:17:35 I totally get you. Obsession with technological advancement has a tendency to lead toward seeing nature as a potential commodities lying in wait, rather than something that should be left to be, and that we are not separate from.
50 2018-02-14 22:15:05 The conversion of money into capital has to be explained on the basis of the laws that regulate the exchange of commodities r in such a way that the starting-point is the exchange of equiva- lents.
51 2018-02-14 22:11:58 It is therefore impossible that outside the sphere of circu- lation, a producer of commodities can, without coming into con- tact with other commodity-owners, expand value, and conse- quently convert money or commodities into capital.
52 2018-02-14 22:07:57 The side with all the guns and ammo also has nearly all of the farms, food and other necessary commodities. And the libs are isolated mostly in a few small areas surrounded by the rest of us. Logistically they wouldn’t stand a chance.
53 2018-02-14 21:57:39 yea but I’m more into reg currency and commodities what i posted was crypto  XRPUSD (ripple vs US dollar)

61 2018-02-14 21:25:27 I can understand that too but growing up on commodities wasn't the worst thing that ever happened to me.
62 2018-02-14 21:23:59 WFB wrote an article years ago advocating for freely providing  four commodities essential for staving off biological hunger.  One was  wheat but I can't remember the other three.  I read it in his book Right Reason.  Very interesting proposal.
63 2018-02-14 21:23:32 That’s why commodities are better than food stamps.
64 2018-02-14 21:17:01 For instance, Condillac says: "It is not true that on an exchange of commodities we give value for value.
65 2018-02-14 21:16:24 Hence, we see that behind all attempts to represent th& circulation of commodities as a source of surplus-value, there lurks a quid pro quo, a mixing up of use-value and exchange-value.
66 2018-02-14 21:08:17 It was not clear cut,it was like I’m in JSE watching markets commodities going up and down 
67 2018-02-14 21:07:11 Probably not feasible with fresh whole foods but think back to the "commodities" distributed in the fifties and sixties. Cheese, powdered milk, peanut butter, canned ham and other surplus foods.
68 2018-02-14 21:06:26 My single mom picked fruit here in California and we are White. No food stamps...once a month you could get "Commodities" which were powdered milk and canned chicken etc. We survived!
69 2018-02-14 21:03:48 Martis, don't  you think we can de-couple from the Dow to the extent that we did not go up as rapidly? And what of resource companies and commodities  in an inflationary environment?

77 2018-02-14 20:51:13 And the more the #socialcare system treats people as commodities then the greater the vulnerability and risk becomes
78 2018-02-14 20:44:31 If now we take in turn each of the two different forms which self-expanding value successively assumes in the course of its life, we then arrive at these two prop- ositions: Capital is money: Capital is commodities.
79 2018-02-14 20:40:20 Non perishables and government peanut butter are already distributed as "commodities", I thought. This sounds like it's just an excuse to take SNAP away, along with healthy fresh food purchases.
80 2018-02-14 20:38:27 Yes I know that, I was there. But  the commodities were so much they easily lasted a month. I'm not saying food stamps should b replaced but these commodities should be brought back. It was good food and really helped people.
81 2018-02-14 20:37:52 Give them all commodities. It's what they gave out on the Indian Reservation when I lived there. Canned meat, fruit and all the Staples. No soda or frozen ready to eat meals
82 2018-02-14 20:37:38 On the discovery of money, barter of neces- sity developed into xotTirjUxT), into trading in commodities, and this again, in opposition to its original tendency, grew into Chrematistic, into the art of making money.
83 2018-02-14 20:31:22 Literally, the income of the food and beverage industry dropped by almost 50%, destroying the subsidy mechanism for basic food commodities and massively expanding the black market
84 2018-02-14 20:28:56 Canned foods aren't healthy!

If their going to pull this off it will have to include sustainable community gardens.

Have you ever done a nutrition study on the ingredients in commodities or canned foods?

Fresh produce or not at all!

88 2018-02-14 20:21:30 Buying wholesale I can't imagine how it would be less. I remember commodities and they were in huge amounts. So much that often times they were bartered for other food items.
89 2018-02-14 20:14:59 Women aren't treated as commodities. This video is about vegan men.
90 2018-02-14 20:10:46 They are both money, and therefore are not qualitatively different use-values; for money is but the converted form of commodities, in which their particular use-values vanish.
91 2018-02-14 20:05:46 "And in fact, I still think the chances of a Central Bank gone rogue melt-up is way higher than the market believes.".   That's it.  Is what it is.  Buy commodities.....

99 2018-02-14 19:40:12 Commodities up up big today pretty much across the board.  They must have heard the inflation news and decided to catch up!  The beginning of a new commodity boom era?  Many analysts think so.
100 2018-02-14 19:38:54 Have you ever tried to find a competent lawyer or doctor? Only few are truly competent. Many of their services have become commodities  too.
101 2018-02-14 19:37:00 If you don't mind my saying so, I think they didn't record it because it was too significant to record. Commodities don't have birth days. People do.
102 2018-02-14 19:35:00 Most traders don't trade commodities, and that's probably good. There's just way too much risk.  Look at #NatGas for instance. Thankfully I didn't rush in...
103 2018-02-14 19:33:56 No people, no customers. It is in the capitalist-class's self-interest to ensure the reproduction of customers for the commodities it produces. Not that letting people die is much of a problem for them either, OTOH.
104 2018-02-14 19:31:41 Valentine's Day spreads the lie that love and affection are scarce commodities for those lucky enough to find it, and takes one of the actual human universals and reduces it to one specific type of good deemed desirable.

118 2018-02-14 18:59:00 I allocate capital opportunistically, so I am perhaps a bit different than average investors in that sense. With that in mind the opportunities I see on my radar right now are commodities, emerging markets and renewable energy.

139 2018-02-14 18:34:25 The weighting on cost illustrates which projects are seen as commodities vs. which are primarily value-based.
140 2018-02-14 18:32:53 I wasn't talking about the proposed boxes but the commodities produced by US farmers/ranchers that go into the CURRENT commodities.
141 2018-02-14 18:31:29 I agree, Maria. Children are not commodities. 
Every child should know their mummy and daddy.
142 2018-02-14 18:29:19 Were VIX futures manipulated???????Manipulation is a civil and criminal violation under commodities law, said Craig Pirrong, a professor of finance at the University of Houston.

And if I may temper this tweet I would suggest; Don't consider yourself a genius if you haphazardly found yourself here like a late 90's dot com investor or a late 08 real estate/commodities trader. Recognize where you are within what is occurring or be humbled

145 2018-02-14 18:24:08 The moon comment was a bit of a joke, though the nice long green candle was a hell of a ride. Nonetheless I made bank, closed the position and I'm happy. Crypto for me is a long term thing, commodities allow me to play the other side of the market for future investment capital.
146 2018-02-14 18:20:30 US 10Y just hit new 52 week high...market doesn't care. Last week, it was a big deal, with equities, commodities, cryptos down, with $ up. Today, all 3 are up, $ down 
147 2018-02-14 18:19:47 Nice thought to het publicity but expired commodities are thrown not used
148 2018-02-14 18:17:08 fuck this capitalistic holiday that emphasizes buying shit to show how much you care/ love certain ppl in your life. appreciation doesn't need to be expressed through commodities & it certainly shouldn't be done once a year
149 2018-02-14 18:17:04 The obligations falling due within a given period, represent the sum of the prices of the commodities, the sale of which gave rise to those obligations.

151 2018-02-14 18:14:35 It’s the old commodities scam.
152 2018-02-14 18:13:19 The value- form of commodities, money, is therefore now the end and aim of a sale, and that owing to a social necessity springing out of the process of circulation itself.
153 2018-02-14 18:08:24 OFFS It's not "Reagan's Government" anything. Google Commodities. It's a way for the US to sell off free market produced goods to keep production here in the US. And they taste GOOD!!!

160 2018-02-14 17:56:37 This is a throwback to the 1980s, when a lot of low-income people were eligible to receive surplus commodities.  The "government cheese," powdered milk, powdered eggs, beans and in some instances canned vegetables/fruit.  The canned stuff?  The low-quality generic.
161 2018-02-14 17:53:58 Again, the production of different commodities depends on different seasons of the year.
162 2018-02-14 17:49:56 Is this whole dollar down situation way better for emerging markets and commodities then  ?
163 2018-02-14 17:49:16 Food assistance needs to go back to the distribution of commodities, beans, rice, cheese... nothing makes me more angry to be in the grocery line seeing EBT used to buy a mountain of t-bone, steak and the like. If they worked for a living they wouldn’t eat that way. #Corruption
164 2018-02-14 17:45:25 It’s back to the days of commodities. Lived on that food for awhile back when America was great. No fresh fruit or veggies. Not a good diet at all.

170 2018-02-14 17:26:29 Just as every qualitative difference between commodities is ex- tinguished in money, so money, on its side, like the radical leveller that it is, does away with all distinctions.
171 2018-02-14 17:19:29 Its good that commodities are now more expensive so more or less everything you need to live on is more expensive? we already have foodbanks...
172 2018-02-14 17:18:59 Had to process a bit.  Think its fairly simple,  trade from here:  Weak dollar and ultimately and absolute flood into inflationary stocks and commodities.
173 2018-02-14 17:17:57 Everything is a business, the harsh reality is fighters are replaceable commodities, so they need workers rights to protect themselves
I'm all for laws to guarantee a certain %$ so a promoter or manager can never earn more than the fighters & profit should be offset for aftercare
174 2018-02-14 17:17:54 An “acceptable” level of inflation as a way of letting the price of labour “float” like other commodities: a cut in wages would trigger unrest, just having that money being able to buy less just triggers grumbling.
175 2018-02-14 17:17:38 His wants are constantly making themselves felt, and necessitate the continual purchase of other people's commodities, while the production and sale of his own goods require time, and depend upon circumstances.
176 2018-02-14 17:14:19 Bring back commodities, it worked in the past.
177 2018-02-14 17:10:09 Commodities are thus sold not for the purpose of buying others, but in order to replace their commodity-form by their money-form.
178 2018-02-14 17:07:57 That hot inflation number is shocking the interest rate complex. I expect pressure on equities to follow. 

US dollar continuing its downward trend. Will help emerging markets, gold & other commodities,and hurt margins of US importers.
179 2018-02-14 17:07:07 I’m an American Indian, and had to use the food allotment program (Commodities) and it feed my family when I lost my job. I was glad to have it, and it worked fine.
180 2018-02-14 17:07:02 E essas categorias nem são adequadas. Talvez exportadores de commodities x desenvolvimentistas faça mais sentido.
181 2018-02-14 16:56:36 They should just put more emphasis on the Commodities program. But I suppose they have to get the money back that they gave all of those rich people in tax cuts somewhere. Why not take it from poor people? All for small government but want them to control what people eat. Legit.

184 2018-02-14 16:54:32 Only in so far as paper money represents gold, which like all other commodities has value, is it a symbol of value.
185 2018-02-14 16:53:55 The relation between it and the values of commodities is this, that the latter are ideally expressed in the same quantities of gold that are symbolically represented by the paper.

189 2018-02-14 16:46:36 The government cheese was the best! It was made in Wisconsin. The factory burned really bad and the government chose to stop the commodities rather than rebuild.

191 2018-02-14 16:44:26 My family received commodities when I was very young. I remember dried milk that was lumpy when rehydrated, big blocks of american cheese, chicken parts in a can with lots of greasy jelly, etc. Jars of dry peanut butter, bags of dry beans. Once a month.
192 2018-02-14 16:44:10 When I was a kid, before there were Food Stamps, we had "commodities." My Mom got boxes of surplus cheese, butter, flour, canned goods, peanut butter, etc. We ate good.
193 2018-02-14 16:43:30 That's why they gave us prunes with our commodities. I remember it well. This plan has me really pissed.
194 2018-02-14 16:42:28 This is nothing like Blue Apron. It's like getting a box of canned goods from the Food Bank. It actually seems like a restarting of the old Commodities program that used to  be around before food stamps. You'd stand in line for a box of powdered milk and eggs, lard, flour, 1/
195 2018-02-14 16:42:03 Money based upon credit implies on the other hand conditions, which, from our standpoint of the simple circulation of commodities, are as yet totally unknown to us.
196 2018-02-14 16:38:01 Crypto currencies are like Bitcoin are commodities. Some tokens are securities. Coins are critical to the decentralized ledgers and make them work. Past is prologue. Look at the way the US treated options and see how they are widely accepted now.
197 2018-02-14 16:37:28 @blaypalmer @CharlesLevkoe Congrats! I like it, specially the "Food is sacred" part. Perhaps you can use multidimensional food valuation (see my papers) as indicator for this section. In p. 32, it refers to farm commodities but p.77 says food shall not be treated as a commodity.

199 2018-02-14 16:31:12 I understand. As I posted earlier, I grew up dirt poor...5 kids in my family. We lived in a small town with very few jobs. We got food stamps, commodities and ate from Kroger’s trash when they would discard out-of-date items (bread, cookies, etc).
200 2018-02-14 16:20:49 As to the further development of this theory by Ricardo and his disciples, James Mill, Lord Overstone, and others, see    MONEY, OR THE CIRCULATION OF COMMODITIES 125  the establishment of a standard of prices, is the business of the State.
201 2018-02-14 16:20:28 Interesting Fun Fact.....the government have our food Commodities during '70's called surplus, in addition to food stamps
202 2018-02-14 16:19:05 While I have sympathy for his loss he does not have the knowledge necessary to deal with a crisis of this magnitude. He's a former commodities trader and talking head who, sadly, lost his son. Can we can get someone like @drdrew in there who is familiar with the topic. PLEASE!
203 2018-02-14 16:18:57 If we start from the notion that all commodities together form one single commodity, of which each is but an aliquot part, we get the following beautiful result: The total commodity=x cwt.
204 2018-02-14 16:18:45 Exactly. And the horror of those commodities boxes is that they contain canned fruits (in heavy syrup-yuck and not healthful) and veg (just yuck) and it’s presumed that everyone can eat the same cereals and pastas. Why replace already tricky SNAP with that?!
205 2018-02-14 16:17:42 That the price of each single kind of commodity forms a part of the sum of the prices of all the commodities in circulation, is a self-evident proposition.
206 2018-02-14 16:15:50 Sounds like the old USDA commodities program that they had in the 70, back then we were happy to get it n
207 2018-02-14 16:08:55 If your company gets paid US$ for commodities sold, this Zuma saga strengthening the Namibian Rand is bad for business
208 2018-02-14 16:08:25 The crisis of modern democracy is a profound one. Free and credible elections, a free press and an independent judiciary mean little when the free market has  reduced them to commodities available on sale to the highest bidder.
209 2018-02-14 16:08:00 Remember that USDA food benefits were originally “welfare” for over production by corporate farms....this is what the “commodities” (cheese anyone?) program was too...dumping over-refined “foods” on the poor...

211 2018-02-14 16:06:27 The quantity of the circulating medium will increase, provided the number of commodities increase quicker, or the rapidity of circulation decrease quicker, than the prices fall.
212 2018-02-14 16:05:49 With a general fall in the prices of commodities, the quan- tity of the circulating medium will remain constant, provided the number of commodities increase proportionally to their fall in price, or provided the velocity of currency decrease in the same proportion.

216 2018-02-14 16:02:05 These three factors, however, state of prices, quantity of circulating commodities, and velocity of money-currency, are all variable.
217 2018-02-14 16:01:27 But the sum of the prices of the circulating commodities depends on the quantity, as well as on the prices, of the commodities.
218 2018-02-14 16:00:44 Helped deliver food boxes to children & their families during a local school's winter break. Was surprised by how many families were hungry. Those children & families were ecstatic to receive the food. Also, I remember commodities from years ago.

227 2018-02-14 15:51:22 My Grandmother used to buy (or was given?) Govt. surplus cheese - but it was her choice not something imposed. The govt used to buy some commodities (mostly to prop up prices for farmers). Does that still happen & can SNAP/welfare families get it at a discount?

231 2018-02-14 15:46:10 All roads point to gold and to a lesser extent commodities...
232 2018-02-14 15:45:50 If the mass of commodities remain constant, the quantity of circulating money varies with the fluctuations in the prices of those commodities.

234 2018-02-14 15:42:54 Financial pundits claim commodities do poorly when rates look like they are going to rise...so anyone care to take a stab at why CPI numbers, which nearly guarantee rate hikes for this year, are driving metals up?

237 2018-02-14 15:41:47 I remember at one time the federal government attempted to give food stamp recepients government commodities and all you heard were complaints.
238 2018-02-14 15:40:30 @realDonaldTrump Sir, you're a GENIUS and so brave. Commodities instead of Food Stamps- GREAT IDEA!!! (but watch out for grocery lobby)

240 2018-02-14 15:37:06 My husband & I qualify for food stamps, choose not to. We do get commodities from USDA through local food pantry for seniors only. If we had to live off that box we'd survive 5 days. That's having cereal 2 meals a day,  2 canned meat based meals total, lots of cheese sandwiches
241 2018-02-14 15:36:29 There was so much waste of those commodities ( that's what my folks called them) people traded sold  but those damned pinto and lima  beans were a treasure. Don't like them to this day. 
242 2018-02-14 15:33:33 My mom, as a minister, helped run a gvt funded commodities program for seniors in her small town. The results weren’t great, most of the food did not meet the nutritional needs of the people who got it.
243 2018-02-14 15:32:37 When I was a small child I remember vividley going to the Fair Grounds with my Grandfather (60's) and getting boxes of what they called commodities. They were large boxes and all I remember was the big thick cheeze was off the chain. They did not get stamps, actual food.
244 2018-02-14 15:31:55 Exactly what I was thinking... if commodities were to be handed out to the rest of the population just imagine to uproar and backlash it would cause.
245 2018-02-14 15:25:58 They already get this if they want it. It’s called commodities. They have to drive somewhere to pick it up. If they have a car. If they can afford gas. It’s processed cheese in a box. Off brand canned meat, fruit and veggies.Not fit for human consumption.

250 2018-02-14 15:22:42 When I was a very young kid we very poor and received government commodities.

251 2018-02-14 15:22:05 We called it "Commodities" when I was growing up in the 60s. Grew up on them and they kept us alive.  Of my other 5 siblings, none of us continued on welfare as adults.

265 2018-02-14 14:59:00 It is constantly being precipitated into new places in the arena of circulation vacated by other commodities.
266 2018-02-14 14:54:27 Doesn't make sense still... arbitrage means trading commodities between different markets. Google the definition. 

You are simply trying to say swing trading, arbitrage does not fit that bill.
267 2018-02-14 14:52:37 Pre-foodstamp days, I recall as a child, going w/my grandparents to take some poor folks from church to get their commodities. It was rice, beans,cheese,can goods, etc. No junk food, no waste. Not trendy, but they didn't lack for necessities & didn't go hungry.
268 2018-02-14 14:51:16 $AA on sale. Ahead of inflation/ commodities bull cycle. And Trump sanctions. And infrastructure. The market gives you gifts. I love it when a plan comes together. #ValentinesDay
269 2018-02-14 14:50:59 True, but what pushes commodities ?
270 2018-02-14 14:46:33 Run to commodities when inflation spikes. Perfect time to pour money into Gold ETFs
271 2018-02-14 14:45:23 American Indian welfare has done this for years. You show up sign in, put the number living in your household, then wait a little while while they box up your groceries. The program is called Commodities.
272 2018-02-14 14:45:08 RT @AustralianASX: The proof points keep mounting for battery minerals demand. Car makers  have spent billions on plants to build cars they worry they can’t get  the commodities for. Physical cobalt prices were up last week during the  “correction”. We’re still early cycle.
273 2018-02-14 14:40:51 What can be done to combat ESPN's corrosive influence on CBB? Their "coverage" emphasizes individuals (Ben Simmons, Trae Young) over teams, cynically manufacturing commodities they can follow as NBA'ers & has ruined recruiting (3 PFs at Duke just for the path to the league)
274 2018-02-14 14:35:22 What happened to the good old days of obvious welfare handout food stamp coupon books and standing in line for agriculture surplus commodities -- I loved that cheese, butter and canned stuff -- especially the cheese #FoodStamps #Snap

277 2018-02-14 14:29:40 More like they transfer it onto commodities. Ever watch a car ad these days? You'd think someone was about to marry an automobile.

282 2018-02-14 14:22:47 The dollar surged on this morning's inflation data and the bulk of the dollar-denominated commodities immediately came under pressure, including crude oil and the grain complex. The dollar has eased back from its highs during the AM pause in the grain trade. #OATT
283 2018-02-14 14:21:20 “In 1847 The Economist described China’s ban on opium as ‘silly’ (it continues to argue that prohibition of drugs does more to boost traffickers’ profits than to prevent addiction). Until 1916, this newspaper listed opium in its weekly list of commodities prices.” @TheEconomist
284 2018-02-14 14:20:56 Agree but deflation is bad for debt and bad for commodities. Prefer modest inflation so business and consumers don't  hold off on spending.
285 2018-02-14 14:20:25 During Reagan, we received commodities for three years. My wife had two jobs and I was in medical school. We also benefited from low-interest student loans. Both programs were helpful, appreciated.
286 2018-02-14 14:19:01 Huhhhh??? 
~did that guy on TV just say higher inflation is bad for commodities??
287 2018-02-14 14:17:06 Native Americans have been getting commodities for years. Grocery store wit free food if you apply. Not junk but the necessities. Good idea!

293 2018-02-14 14:10:57 Did you know that native Americans on reservations still get commodities from the gov't? And much of the food arrives in a moldy or otherwise inedible condition. They won't get anything close to Blue Apron.
294 2018-02-14 14:08:17 Commodities are still a thing. Separate from SNAP at this time, and there is also a commodities program for low-income seniors. Again it is separate from SNAP. In both programs the products are much better than this. Generally. Gov't Cheese is still a thing.

297 2018-02-14 14:02:37 Change what type of foods that qualify. Go back to the commodities. Soft drinks and snacks cakes at 7-11 are not a healthy choice . This saves on healthcare payed out for these people's shit disisons .
298 2018-02-14 14:02:21 That's where James Watt's 1778 Smart Swap business model is useful. Rather than  selling Pumps-as-Commodities he provided Pumping-as-a-Service to Cornish tin mines in exchange for a third of coal savings. Same Tech/IP for fuel savings smart swap is possible with shiptech

300 2018-02-14 13:58:44 I  have a couple of older family members who receive the supplemental commodities boxes each month. The intention may be good, but the food is largely gross and most of it is tossed.  They also receive SNAP, and that is what allows them to shop for healthy food they enjoy.
301 2018-02-14 13:57:51 Why did all commodities drop on the news. Seems odd!
302 2018-02-14 13:54:29 I’m waiting on the market to really pour into commodities. Growing deficit spending, infrastructure bill, weaker dollar, global growth, cheap relative to everything else, Fed tightening . #Commodities #uranium

305 2018-02-14 13:51:51 When you take water from the deep end of the pool and you pour it into the shallow end, Did you raise the shallow end? No. SNAP and EBT etc. are commodities within poor communities that enable the continuance of a permanent underclass. The stats here are deliberately naive.
306 2018-02-14 13:49:24 This "box' is reminiscent of the surplus commodities handed out to the poor and welfare recipients  in the 60's before food stamps. Processed cheese, Spam-like canned meat, beans, rice, flour, butter.....mostly carbs and fat, nothing fresh.  And they think it's a new idea?
307 2018-02-14 13:48:13 U.S. JANUARY CONSUMER PRICES RISE 0.5%; CORE INDEX UP 0.3%. Seguirán aumentando el yield de los bonos, short en Bonos y commodities, y neutral en acciones.
308 2018-02-14 13:46:17 One of the WGS talks was on education in the classroom & what I ultimately perceived as spying. To answer the question. Figure out how to end need & any rationalization for spying & then still deal with the stock market like commodities of people, how they change w/environment.
309 2018-02-14 13:45:02 I remember the old commodities program. Sometimes that was all I had to get through an entire month. Using cloth diapers; saving the Pampers for the babysitter/daycare ctr. Working my ass of in a good job w/shit pay while listening to other people complain...
310 2018-02-14 13:44:06 Commodities as use-values now stand opposed to money as exchange-value.
311 2018-02-14 13:44:04 @FoxBusiness @morningsmaria Get out your chairs.Surround studio with charts of vix,tresuries,currencies,commodities etc then relate to econs globally then bring it down to sectors and finally company specifics. Be a REAL business network. Too complacent/lazy reporting
312 2018-02-14 13:42:52 Commodities, first of all, enter into the process of exchange just as they are.
313 2018-02-14 13:41:32 @TheFive I guess you're all too young to remember when welfare recipients received boxes of commodities to help feed their families.

318 2018-02-14 13:31:14 If I read correctly, the proposal is to not completely eliminate the food stamp program, but to reduce the cash amount and make up the difference with the boxed commodities. I would hope that the USDA would recommend nutritiously balanced boxes.
319 2018-02-14 13:27:27 Those commodities kept my family from going hungry on many occasions. It was a welcomed favor in our household.
320 2018-02-14 13:25:25 plus, 99% of our history, currencies has been self decreed only by the usage of commodities. Like Bitcoin is (a commodity)...
321 2018-02-14 13:23:36 In the early 70’s my mom got "commodities" for several months, had to find a ride to pick them up, if you weren’t one of the first in line, no real cheese, only powdered.
322 2018-02-14 13:22:53 Yeppers when your hungry,you don't care were your food comes from, i remember as a kid we would go get our commodities and was very grateful for them, and last year watching a person trade their food stamp card for drugs.
323 2018-02-14 13:20:34 Not proposing any increase in petrol prices, but convert the existing tax into cess. Also, petrol prices usually don't cause commodities and transport price hikes, but diesel price increases do.
324 2018-02-14 13:16:05 I grew up eating #commodities.
I HATED - powdered milk.
Now I know why. I LOVE dairy fats (if you’ve met me in real life, then you know this about me)
Govt cheese - made the best cheese toast (grill cheese sandwiches) but it locked up like mad
325 2018-02-14 12:59:26 I had an elderly aunt who received "Commodities" before Food Stamp Program. A box of food each month filled with nothing more than flour-powdered milk-govt. cheese-etc. Nothing healthy. We can't go back to that.
326 2018-02-14 12:57:19 #cobalt and #lithium are the “designer” commodities of today, but what will tomorrow’s in demand metals be? Work that out, get set early and ride your profits. Patience is the key to wealth.

No, @politico you shouldn't be able to basically buy an immigrant, and no GOP you should not use their lives as some
330 2018-02-14 12:39:49 Commodities with definite prices present themselves under the form: a commodity A=x gold; b commodity B =z gold; c commodity C=y gold, &c, where a, b, c, represent definite quantities of the commodities A, B, G and x, z, y, definite quan- tities of gold.
331 2018-02-14 12:38:18 @TheFive In the 60's and 70's my grandmother was poor, but she received a small welfare check and food commodities. She would go to the grocery store to supplement with fresh veggies and fruit. Some of the best meals I have ever had were commodities foods my gransmother cooked.

336 2018-02-14 12:27:51 When poor Trump supporters find themselves in food lines waiting for their commodities and government cheese to feed their families, I wonder if they'll be thinking about how #MAGA is now?
337 2018-02-14 12:27:37 Mining cobalt, copper and diamonds. Wonder which British companies operate there or profit from these commodities? The usual winking emoji applies.
338 2018-02-14 12:24:59 In simplest terms, Food Lion used to relabel fresh food, pushing out expiration dates. Don't just think of luxuries, think of perishable commodities.
339 2018-02-14 12:21:34 They still are but too many grifters learned they could become county employees/friends w/them and get over the commodities and make a bit of money on the side off the backs of the poor.
340 2018-02-14 12:20:11 Second, I don't care whose idea, Obama, Clinton, Trump,  the Dali Lama, it is a stupid idea.  The logistics of it would be an expensive nightmare.  Plus you have the government spending money on commodities, instead of organizations and businesses.  This will hurt the job market.
341 2018-02-14 12:17:21 It is because all commodities, as values, are realised human labour, and therefore commensurable, that their values can be measured by one and the same special commodity, and the latter be converted into the common measure of their values, i.
342 2018-02-14 12:15:10 Experience is one of the most valuable commodities you can have. I will not be afraid to harness it. #experience #life
343 2018-02-14 12:14:50 I didn't get that point from it. I saw the point as what the actual proposed commodities being distributed were- and I read it as fresh foods NOT being part of it. I'll have to go back and re-read in case I misread!!
344 2018-02-14 12:11:06 Before you disparage #Commodities distribution directly to people who need assistance, you don’t understand snap is administered by USDA. Our Local Medicaid office gives Farmer’s Market Vouchers for fresh foods. Churches, civic groups, restaurants can step up. Skip Middle Men!
345 2018-02-14 12:10:47 When I was a kid we would go to the courthouse and get commodities this must have been before food stamps @LauraMonteverdi @TheRealAPNews @RobEvansTV
346 2018-02-14 12:01:41 When I was on welfare as a child, we got ‘commodities’ and they were awful.  Commodities are the same thing being proposed.
347 2018-02-14 11:54:33 Increasing access to and use of #FamilyPlanning commodities can make valuable contributions to achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). @pai_org @PathfinderInt @PATHadvocacy @PalladiumImpact @riseupforgirls
348 2018-02-14 11:47:43 They're called commodities and they're already sent to Indian reservations
349 2018-02-14 11:46:02 When I was growing up we used to get “commodities” of things like cheese and other food assistance. To this day the word commodity retains a slight association with poverty. And cheese.

354 2018-02-14 11:25:21 This is one of the reasons why prices of commodities are on the high side. they dn't consider the fact that many of the steps the take ar directly or indirectly tied with the economy and that's why our economy still remain unfriendly to Nigerians.

359 2018-02-14 11:08:57 I am old enough to remember when we had a govt commodities program. You would go pick up a box of food that had a big tin of peanut butter, bags of rice and beans,  and a huge block of  velveta style govt. cheese! We were happy to have it

368 2018-02-14 10:42:03 Society doesn’t care if you know dates of wars or Generals names or what an infinitive clause is (unless on Jeopardy). Do we only learn things because society values them as sellable commodities? (Plus lots of people making money playing video games in a variety of ways).
369 2018-02-14 10:39:04 People are pricing in inflation in the US yet nearly every G20 nation has been reporting weak inflation & PPI for the last two months, time to long everything again for the final blow off top before the crash. Eur Long, Commodities Long, & equities long. It’s all about liquidity!
370 2018-02-14 10:38:09 Fetishism inherent in commodities, or by the objective appearance of the social characteristics of labour, is shown, amongst other ways, by the dull and tedious quarrel over the part played by Nature in the formation of exchange-value.
371 2018-02-14 10:26:20 Also, church volunteers delivered commodities back in the day.
372 2018-02-14 10:18:11 Let 9 million lose their jobs, pay through the nose for houses, oil, electricity, natural gas and other commodities as well as 35 States losing Canada as their #1 buyer of goods. We shouldn't do biz with a country with a broken moral compass anyways. It's hypocritical.
373 2018-02-14 10:15:48 he may be true but question is that who will solve country problem like unemploymnt,hungr,garibi,illiteracy,speedy trial,rampant corruption in systm,farmer suicides,tute roads,lack of school/hospital,rising prices of essential commodities,punishment to big politicians/ghotalawaz?
374 2018-02-14 10:14:42 Yeah, I'm old enough to remember commodities. There was a reason we went to food stamps & away from humiliating people with big ugly cans of nasty "food".  Been there, doesn't work.
375 2018-02-14 10:06:20 Here the par- ticular and natural form of labour, and not, as in a society based on production of commodities, its general abstract form is the immediate social form of labour.
376 2018-02-14 10:04:26 Love the idea!  Commodities like people got in the 60’s!!!

 #poetry #quantum
380 2018-02-14 09:54:29 The whole mystery of commodities, all the magic and necromancy that surrounds the products of labour as long as they take the form of commodities, vanishes therefore, so soon as we come to other forms of production.
381 2018-02-14 09:52:25 Guarantee my kids wouldn't eat 98% of what's in a box of commodities, which I have seen because my mom has gotten them from the senior center. Glad we don't need it or they'd starve. Shelf stable milk, processed cheese, canned vegetables, some other crappy stuff..
382 2018-02-14 09:49:36 Commodities usually move against Bonds & indices 
.
Lower US dollar means higher Commodities prices that leads to higher interest rates and higher inflation which all pressure on Bond prices and pushing it down and so do the indices

383 2018-02-14 09:48:19 So pay farmers (probably Perdue cronies) more, paying more to package and distribute "food" instead of letting people buy it-- to punish them. Ignorance! Commodities are in addition to, not a substitute for buying food.
384 2018-02-14 09:43:24 So basically his vision is a new New York. Tar and feathers are still commodities
385 2018-02-14 09:42:33 They did a something similar in January 2016 right? Commodities to run again?
386 2018-02-14 09:29:11 This program existed when I was a kid. In the families on the “commodities” program the kids were obese but had nutritional deficiencies. Adults had diabetes, cancer and heart disease. All were dead in their fifties or earlier. These programs feed food industry waste to the poor.

388 2018-02-14 09:25:47 Whence, then, arises the enigmatical character of the product of labour, so soon as it assumes the form of commodities?
389 2018-02-14 09:24:45 Oro al alza al igual que el Bitcoin. Caen petróleo, commodities agrícolas y el cobre.
390 2018-02-14 09:23:21 I grew up in a neighborhood of poor. My own family wasn’t on welfare, but families who were received “surplus commodities,” high starch, sugar, fat bulk foods. Kids were all obese but with deficiencies, adults had diabetes and heart disease. I’m suspicious of the nuttition.
391 2018-02-14 09:19:38 "houses are turned back from commodities into community assets... with wit, grit and brilliant strategising."

It's a wonderful article.
392 2018-02-14 09:13:19 Like all other commodities, it was also capable of serving as an equivalent, either as simple equivalent in isolated exchanges, or as particular equivalent by the side of others.
393 2018-02-14 09:12:42 Gold is now money with reference to all other commodities only because it was previously, with reference to them, a simple commodity.
394 2018-02-14 09:05:12 This equivalent has no relative form of value in com- mon with other commodities, but its value is relatively expressed by a never ending series of other commodities.

396 2018-02-14 08:59:03 @hans_nich Hi! Are you interested in a new analysis on the environmental and human impact of agricultural commodities trade (including palm oil, soy, timber and beef) with the EU in 11 countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia?
397 2018-02-14 08:58:58 Form B shows that only one single commodity at a time can completely expand its relative value, and that it acquires this expanded form only because, and in so far as, all other commodities are, with respect to it, equivalents.
398 2018-02-14 08:57:57 Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs is investing more into the bank's bond trading business, after its fixed-income, currencies and commodities (FICC) unit faltered in recent years.

400 2018-02-14 08:55:14 The expanded form of relative value, which is the expression of the value of one commodity in terms of all other commodities, endows those other commodities with the character of particu- lar equivalents differing in kind.
401 2018-02-14 08:53:21 That form consequently makes it indispu- tably evident that in the world of commodities the character possessed by all labour of being human labour constitutes its specific social character.
402 2018-02-14 08:52:25 Happy consumerism of love & association of mass produced monetary symbols and commodities day 
403 2018-02-14 08:48:59 The bodily form of the linen is now the form assumed in common by the values    COMMODITIES 67    of all commodities; it therefore becomes directly exchangeable with all and every of them.
404 2018-02-14 08:47:19 I remember the food commodities that were given out in the 50’s
405 2018-02-14 08:47:07 All commodities being equated to linen now appear not only as qualitatively equal as values generally, but also as values whose magnitudes are capable of comparison.
406 2018-02-14 08:46:29 It thus becomes evident that, since the existence of commodities as values is purely social, this social existence can be expressed by the totality of their social relations alone, and consequently that the form of their value must be a socially recognised form.

409 2018-02-14 08:43:22 By this form, commodities are, for the first time, effectively brought into relation with one another as values, or made to appear as exchange-values.
410 2018-02-14 08:42:08 The third and lastly developed form expresses the values of the whole world of commodities in terms of a single commodity set apart for the purpose, namely, the linen, and thus represents to us their values by means of their equality with linen.
411 2018-02-14 08:41:43 Depends on where you are - commodities are still around. Others besides ebt qualify. 

Do you understand how fraud actually works? USDA uses volunteers not fraud investigators.
412 2018-02-14 08:41:30 The expanded form of value comes into actual ex- istence for the first time so soon as a particular product of labour, such as cattle, is no longer exceptionally, but habitually, ex- changed for various other commodities.
413 2018-02-14 08:40:53 On the other hand, any general expression of value common to all is directly excluded; for, in the equation of value of each com- modity, all other commodities now appear only under the form of    66 CAPITALIST PRODUCTION    equivalents.
414 2018-02-14 08:40:43 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
415 2018-02-14 08:40:15 This form, it is plain, occurs practically only in the first beginning, when the products of labour are converted into commodities by accidental and occasional exchanges.
416 2018-02-14 08:35:50 We're all just commodities Scott.
417 2018-02-14 08:29:05 In fact there is another story . During 2014 elections my son told the same seeing modiji and I followed it but today I am repenting..Skyrocketing fuel prices and other commodities ,joblessness .  can't see any real change except wondeeful speech
418 2018-02-14 08:28:24 In the same way the manifold concrete useful kinds of labour, embodied in these different commodities, rank now as so many different forms of the realisation, or manifestation, of undifferentiated human labour.
419 2018-02-14 08:27:47 The bodily form of each of these commodities figures now as a particular equivalent form, one out of many.

423 2018-02-14 08:22:47 It becomes plain, that it is not the exchange of commodities which regulates the magnitude of their value; but, on the contrary, that it is the magnitude of their value which controls their exchange proportions.

425 2018-02-14 08:19:40 The linen, by virtue of the form of its value, now stands in a social relation, no longer with only one other kind of commodity, but with the whole world of commodities.
426 2018-02-14 08:17:48 The Expanded Relative form of value  The value of a single commodity, the linen, for example, is now expressed in terms of numberless other elements of the world of commodities.
427 2018-02-14 08:15:35 Yeah. It sure depends. GOOD for me, my $ pension is happy. Altho the increase is negated by the concomitant increases of prime commodities! HELPPPPP!
428 2018-02-14 08:09:04 For them there consequently exists neither value, nor magnitude of value, anywhere except in its expression by means of the exchange- relation of commodities, that is, in the daily list of prices current.
429 2018-02-14 08:07:49 The mercantilists lay special stress on the qualitative aspect of the expression of value, and consequent- ly on the equivalent form of commodities, which attains its full perfection in money.
430 2018-02-14 08:07:11 This, however, is the delusion as well    COMMODITIES 61    of the mercantilists and their recent revivers, Ferrier, Ganilh, l and others, as also of their antipodes, the modern bagmen of Free-trade, such as Bastiat.

432 2018-02-14 08:00:09 I think comparing  #TrumpBoxes to Blue Apron-style meals over-sells the project. What they're really talking about is boxing up commodities people usually go to the local food pantry for. Beans, processed cheese, canned everything… powdered milk…

440 2018-02-14 07:33:24 Aboriginals regularly made slaves of conquered peoples. I think it was in part a consequence of not having prisons. In fact, slaves were one of three primary “commodities” shipped across prairie trade routes. Here’s an article about slavery on the west coast.

444 2018-02-14 07:22:51 Therefore, when we say that a commodity is in the equivalent form, we express the fact that it is directly ex- changeable with other commodities.

450 2018-02-14 07:06:42 ya, it's pretty obvious that's happening, canada subsidizes companies to export resources which get sold back to us, it's why the dollar moves lockstep with major commodities, yet no canadian government has ever had a guts to diversify the economy
451 2018-02-14 07:06:31 Yeah, I think the “Blue Apron” thing is a good idea.  I lived on Indian commodities for 15 years raising 3 kids. The food was good, wholesome, and very edible. Especially those blocks of cheese and the canned pork and beef. Fresh vegetables as well as canned. @realDonaldTrump
452 2018-02-14 07:02:53 By putting itself in rela- tion with commodity B, as value in propria persona, as the matter of which human labour is made up, the commodity A converts    1 In a sort of way, it is with man as with commodities.

460 2018-02-14 06:47:54 In order to express the value of the linen as a congelation of human labour, that value must be expressed as having objective existence, as being a something materially different from the linen itself, and yet a something common to the linen and all other commodities.

466 2018-02-14 06:24:48 Here two different kinds of commodities (in our example the linen and the coat), evidently play two different parts.
467 2018-02-14 06:22:56 Hence the relation between the values of two commodities supplies us with the simplest expression of the value of a single commodity.

471 2018-02-14 06:14:49 The reality of the value of commodities differs in this respect from Dame Quickly, that we don't know "where to have it.
472 2018-02-14 06:14:11 They manifest themselves therefore as commodities, or have the form of com- modities, only in so far as they have two forms, a physical or natural form, and a value-form.
473 2018-02-14 06:13:30 You have said it well. Do away with cash. Give commodities. Money is often not spent as it should be. Children rarely benefit from food stamps.
474 2018-02-14 06:12:56 Commodities come into the world in the shape of use-values, articles, or goods, such as iron, linen, corn, &c.
475 2018-02-14 06:11:02 The next big Silicon Valley idea is going to be treating prisoners in for-profit prisons as commodities, where anyone can buy and own portions of individuals and earn a return on their labor profits. It'll be call Blockchaingang.
476 2018-02-14 06:10:29 Actually I have to speak out against this one. I dont know if you are lold enough to remember government commodities but it sounds a lot like thats what Trump wants to bring back. Its going to cost the government more to 1/2

479 2018-02-14 06:02:10 There was a “Commodities” program at one point. Poor people got left over “commodities” that farmer’s couldn’t sell. It frequently included rancid butter and lots of Spam. It was NOT healthy
480 2018-02-14 06:01:04 Since the magnitude of the value of a commodity represents only the quantity of labour embodied in it, it follows that all commodities, when taken in certain proportions, must be equal in value.
481 2018-02-14 05:58:17 Exactly. The return of the commodities programs of 60 years ago.

488 2018-02-14 05:36:05 Only such products can become commodities with regard to each other, as result from different kinds of labour, each kind being carried on independ- ently and for the account of private individuals.
489 2018-02-14 05:35:27 It goes both ways surely - no workers, no company, no profits. Resource companies benefit from the commodities that are owned by all Australians. The debate about what is fair and reasonable in our society at a time when wealth & income distribution is increasingly skewed.
490 2018-02-14 05:34:51 In the primitive Indian community there is social division of labour, without production of commodities.
491 2018-02-14 05:30:23 This is what food assistance used to be.  People called it “commodities”.
492 2018-02-14 05:29:15 I live in Oklahoma where the native Americans have received commodities for years. And nobody has batted an eye.  The food assistance program is just that....assistance!  It's not meant to be a free food for life program.
493 2018-02-14 05:29:14 Let us take two commodities such as a coat and 10 yards of linen, and let the former be double the value of the latter, so that, if 10 yards of linen =W, the coat=2W.
494 2018-02-14 05:28:20 Does anyone else remember the humiliation of standing in line for "commodities"? The perception (if not the reality) that those shoving those boxes of peanut butter and cheese and canned pork off the trucks to us looked on us with disdain. Let's not go there again.
495 2018-02-14 05:22:54 Runny, your argument is nice, but a new government program with commodities is the last thing you want done with your money...

502 2018-02-14 05:08:37 The total labour-power of society, which is embodied in the sum total of the values of all commodities produced by that society, counts here as one homogeneous mass of human labour- power, composed though it be of innumerable individual units.
503 2018-02-14 05:06:16 Agreed. Still long Gold $GC_F here... while I also do think Stocks will globally move higher, I think #Commodities will outperform Equities this year led by breakouts in #Metals like Gold. *And helped by a weaker U.S. Dollar...
504 2018-02-14 05:05:07 Futures are looking okay and all the news coming out is positive for the US economy. Has been steady growth for years now but just depends how the market takes it. Somehow if the economy is doing well it's not good for wall street! Go figure. Commodities the place to be imo.
505 2018-02-14 05:00:02 Commodities: Rubber +1.93%, Wheat -1.36%
506 2018-02-14 04:56:06 The prices of the commodities at the market now increasing day by day leaving an ordinary citizens with an exclamatory faces. #AccessibleFoods
507 2018-02-14 04:55:57 Not a new concept. I grew up eating commodities from the Reservation. This is just a way for the rich to get contracts and take all the money instead of food stamps going into the economy. It will effect businesses in a negative way. Just my opinion.
508 2018-02-14 04:55:33 Dear people having a fit because they want to give out food to people on SNAP. They used to pass out what they called commodities. Rice, beans, cheese, peanut butter, and etc. I know because my single mother used to get it. Calm down. We were glad to have food.
509 2018-02-14 04:54:53 But the exchange of commodities is evidently an act characterised by a total abstraction from use-value.
510 2018-02-14 04:54:15 Such properties claim our attention only in so far as they affect the utility of those commodities, make them use-values.
511 2018-02-14 04:53:00 In the same way the exchange-values of commodities must be capable of being expressed in terms of something common to them all, of which thing they represent a greater or less quantity.
512 2018-02-14 04:52:07 They used to be called commodities.
513 2018-02-14 04:51:23 I grew up with a single parent. This was called government commodities and we went to pick them up once a month. Best grilled cheese ever with what we called government cheese. They handed out rice, beans, peanut butter eyc.  NOT A NEW IDEA. #itdidntkillus #gladtohavehadfood

516 2018-02-14 04:43:06 They did that years ago. It was call commodities.
517 2018-02-14 04:39:55 Correct, the basic commodities that are cornerstone of nutritious meals. I use these on a daily basis and eat healthy and royally.
518 2018-02-14 04:31:52 So, #Trump is proposing giving the commodities issued free from the USDA in place of SNAP; instead of allowing the working poor, elderly, and unemployed to purchased healthy food. Tell him healthy foods do not come out of a can.
519 2018-02-14 04:31:35 I still see commodities when I visit fam.  I don’t want to admit it, but I liked making grilled cheese from the government cheese.
520 2018-02-14 04:30:05 Not sure why the angst.. commodities are given to Native Americans tribes for years.. you are concerned NOW?????
521 2018-02-14 04:29:54 The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as "an immense accumula- tion of commodities," 1 its unit being a single commodity.
522 2018-02-14 04:29:19 We used to have this, it was called the  commodities program. I am from rural Appalachia, most people were too proud to pick them up at the delivery point. They were in serious poverty but wouldn't stand in line for a hand out.

524 2018-02-14 04:29:08 I remember my wonderful Grandmother received commodities & one item was a large container of lard. She had an apple tree & would make delicious crusts for those apple pies with the lard. That was back in the late 40’s early 50’s. My folks supplied her with other healthy items

526 2018-02-14 04:26:54 Yes. It was called commodities. Cheese. Dry milk, peanut butter, dry eggs, etc.
527 2018-02-14 04:24:32 Back in the sixties it was called commodities. Lots of people needed help at that time in northern Arkansas.
528 2018-02-14 04:21:58 Back before food stamps, there were government “commodities”—food...actual food, given out to families in need. I wasn't fancy but it was good wholesome food. Why did we ever abandon that for stamps or cards? Try trading government labeled food for beer and ciggeretts.
529 2018-02-14 04:19:03 It wasn’t food stamps it was separate. You got commodities like cheese, cans of meat and beans etc to supplement your food stores. And to supplement food stamps.
530 2018-02-14 04:18:39 This is excellent idea. In the past pre-snap people received "commodities" when in need, not as a lifetime fund. It worked very  well.
531 2018-02-14 04:16:21 Yep. It used to be called “commodities”. Issued monthly.  Sugar, butter, powdered milk, canned meat, peanut butter, rice, oatmeal, etc. Br
532 2018-02-14 04:13:10 I remember the "Commodities" program. You got a box of powdered milk, slab of velveeta-like cheese, peanut butter in a can, farina, and some Karo syrup. Those were good times.
533 2018-02-14 04:12:52 That’s actually pretty different from the existing H1-B program, in which skilled workers (many already living in the US and working for their sponsor) are awarded residency status and paid a living wage. But sure, let’s buy and sell human beings as commodities, why not?
534 2018-02-14 04:12:00 What could go wrong? The USDA commodities boxes are a good example. Vile, watery canned carrots, potatoes and applesauce. Inedible canned meats with the grease on top, indigestible chile, bags of white rice, but bitter, whole wheat pasta.  Boxes of corn flakes n' powdered milk.
535 2018-02-14 04:09:27 I grew up on this. It is called commodities.  Dried milk, dried eggs,  government cheese, dried beans, corn meal, flour. No fresh food, nothing that can't be stored in warehouses.  Get practical people.
536 2018-02-14 04:07:11 In the 60’s prior to food stamps there was a program that gave out “commodities” to poor folks.  Our family got them to include powder milk & eggs, spam, flour, sugar and I don’t recall what else.  The food was bad, nothing fresh.  It’s a bad idea
537 2018-02-14 04:05:20 Maybe they'll put recipes in the box too. I imagine the biggest problem will be ...too LAZY to make a meal from it. #Commodities
538 2018-02-14 04:03:12 There isn’t another way to drive down cost, which is Amazon’s primary advantage. You need suppliers competing within your marketplace, esp. on commodities. 

Or buy a medical supplies manufacture like Becton Dickenson. But more likely they’d sub-contract out production. 6/
539 2018-02-14 04:02:19 I ate it in the 50's, we called the food commodities. We were happy to get it! Reminds me that "beggars can't be choosers".
540 2018-02-14 03:56:20 Commodities. They're bringing back commodities.  Yeah, that'll take care of the deficit. It's like 45's lighting everything on fire so he can watch us go up in flames... as we watch his impeachment trial.
541 2018-02-14 03:56:09 The indignation of the new SNAP concept never existed when it was imposed on Indigenous people who needed help with food. It’s time to assess why one is terrible and the other doesn’t matter. #FoodStamps #snap #Commodities
542 2018-02-14 03:50:13 Thank you for sharing this thread. Having grown up on Commodities and Food Stamps (at different points in time because you couldn't do both), I can fully back @hugwins thread.
543 2018-02-14 03:42:25 I can see the meals-ready-to-eat (military rations) & commodities, already. True Story: A friend, activist Dyan French Cole, told our local public school board that her dog wouldn't eat the commodities (fed distributes & board buys) they served our children.
544 2018-02-14 03:40:42 They were Called #Commodities...

Back in the 50's and 60's...

#SatansSeed and his #EvilSpirits are trying to take the US back...not forward...

I guess that's how Russia do things...

Father, GOD, please hurry to our rescue!
545 2018-02-14 03:40:37 bigger picture it looks good mate - but i'm generally cautious short to medium term except maybe on some commodities - gold in particular.  A larger 5-wave pattern may have completed in Oct last year as well on $EML which means lower still needed. Been wrong before though LOL !
546 2018-02-14 03:39:29 Let's stop calling it "blue apron".  The box of "commodities" program this administration is proposing WON'T resemble any of the current food delivery programs by a long shot.
547 2018-02-14 03:35:42 Can you say commodities? Lard, flour, cheese, spam. Just as our Indigenous population
548 2018-02-14 03:28:57 In my youth there were food commodity warehouses where the poor could go and pick up various excess commodities, not the most efficient or equitable of systems.
549 2018-02-14 03:28:24 Of course not.   He's giving people peanut butter and powdered milk and government cheese.  He is going back to the old days of commodities.  How could this possibly be a positive change?   "You'll eat what I say and you'll like it!"
550 2018-02-14 03:28:12 Crypto Currency that's not backed by an asset base is just like counterfeit money. The tech is only window dressing. It has 'value' only so long as the illusion of value remains in place. In the end-it can be worth zero, unlike tangible commodities.
551 2018-02-14 03:24:10 suck my commodities. Awe snap.
552 2018-02-14 03:23:36 What Trump wants to send people on foodstamps is not blue apron style food. I remember when commodities were the only food program the government had. Here is what was in them depending on supply. Big cans of spam meat and canned corned beef,beans,rice,flour,corn meal,
553 2018-02-14 03:22:16 @marthamaccallum @FoxNews 
I’ve always thought the ‘commodities’ style food program will keep the govbcost down.  You may have to use your oven and stove but you can feed your family. Why do low income get to eat so well..maybe if they have to work for the better choices....
554 2018-02-14 03:21:53 So he’s proposing commodities for all food stamp recipients?
555 2018-02-14 03:19:10 This is what we had in Minnesota when I was a kid. Many Saturdays were spent standing in line for government commodities: giant cans of white label vegetables, meat, powdered milk, etc. A black market grew up around food people didn’t want or couldn’t eat. Was a horrible system.
556 2018-02-14 03:19:06 The reason we have food stamps/ebt cards is major food chains complained that Gov issued commodities to the poor were in direct competition and effecting their bottom line.
557 2018-02-14 03:18:46 This is no different than the commodities handed out to the poor and working poor in the depression and post-depression. There's a reason we changed the method. It didn't work. Add in the extra expense of delivery and specialized dietary needs and the cost skyrockets. No savings.
558 2018-02-14 03:14:54 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
559 2018-02-14 03:09:47 I think it would be great ....they used to give out commodities all the time and people never complained about being hungry because they had food instead of junk....
560 2018-02-14 03:09:28 Growing up we went to the commodities store. It was government food. You could get canned meats, cheese,  peanut butter and powdered milk (from what I remember). The amount you received depended on your household. We qualified for food stamps but my father refused them.
561 2018-02-14 03:08:52 But in most competitive markets for other commodities, sellers don’t have to sell at an insufficient offering price. They are free to withhold their product.
Is that true in electricity?
562 2018-02-14 03:07:32 I grew up on commodities, which is what this is. Nothing more, nothing less. They were not good. This is taking us back 60 years or more. Heinous idea. Those with food allergies, diabetics, etc., would be negatively impacted by this kind of system.
563 2018-02-14 03:04:55 Lots of maybe's and hopefully's in there. I know there are cap concerns, but I prefer proven commodities in the secondary. It's the main reason we went from 12-6 to back to back 8-9-1 seasons.
564 2018-02-14 03:03:49 Our president should know that we already have a federal program that buys needed food stuff at commodity prices and distributes it to those in need, the USDA commodities program. It is amazing and need and does not solve the same need as the "food stamps" program.
565 2018-02-14 03:02:29 Harvest Boxes, along w/ EBT cards 4 fresh food-great idea. Delivered or avail 4 pick up. No vehicle/gas req. 

Pushback b/c greatly minimizes food stamp fraud opportunity. Big business.

566 2018-02-14 03:00:04 Sounds exactly like what the Commodities program gives to low income seniors. No choices and not very healthy. Also, let’s talk logistics of distribution. Not to mention the increased stigma associated with this. 
567 2018-02-14 02:55:16 The value of the CDN dollar very much impacts demand. There are many high quality global mfg competitors. Germany, Japan, UK, US are a few. Specialty products may have ineleastic demand, but commodities are price driven.
568 2018-02-14 02:49:53 In case anyone is curious what the GOP’s replacement for SNAP would look like: ask anyone who grew up on a reservation or Google “USDA Commodities”.
569 2018-02-14 02:48:03 Dont think they are, local context. If here start taxing crypto..definitely shares, commodities, everything tat has hint of revenue will/has to be pulled in. Then again..this would cause outflow of revenue overall out of the country. Unless what i know is wrong?
570 2018-02-14 02:47:38 When I was a kid these were called “commodities”.  People got gallon cans of things like peanut butter, cheese, spinach, honey, green beans etc.  Enough to live on if you also had a vegetable garden and some chickens.  The idea was for people to be motivated to get a job.
571 2018-02-14 02:46:31 You don't remember commodities and the big 5lb blocks of cheese?
572 2018-02-14 02:42:25 Sounds like a throwback to the old days of “commodities” being given to the poor.
573 2018-02-14 02:39:36 Yep... I remember standing in line for U.S. Commodities cheese and powdered milk w/ my mom. For Thanksgiving one year we got a basket of food from the local church that had a box of Kellogg’s Raisin Bran and I remember being so impressed that we actually got name brand cereal!
574 2018-02-14 02:37:34 Do you also play charts in other asset classes ? It would be interesting to hear you in equity/commodities etc
575 2018-02-14 02:37:30 Even Bing! Should be able to find the USDA website where all this is documented for the 40 year old commodities program the trump proposal is based on.
576 2018-02-14 02:36:10 No on bringing back food commodities @chrislhayes  
The problem is some people do not have a fixed residency.  @maddow 
Let’s repurpose the wall money, to block Russians!
577 2018-02-14 02:34:30 I need to read this. When food stamps replaced commodities in the 1960s, there were complaints that the new program was just a boon to grocery stores. But that's only because it was a boon to grocery stores.
578 2018-02-14 02:32:29 *There is no "be all end all" in this market environment, only short term shakes / vol spikes. Either way - it seems the dips eventually get bought back up. I would like to see some inflation & think commodities / fx will be most sensitive to this data rather than stocks anyways.
579 2018-02-14 02:31:33 #9 to be knick knack ashtrays or for bush meat where they are eaten.  This different species are commodities and "products" is how many humans in the outside world view them.

583 2018-02-14 02:26:23 Agreed, Some states have both F.S. & Commodities, depending on qualifying for either. If you only qual for Commodities you have to stand in line & get what’s given that month. It’s not ideal but helps many ppl. Changes like this don’t happen overnight so not to worry.
584 2018-02-14 02:25:20 That is what commodities were.   WW 2 and aftermath.  Country lost a lot then.  Not just our military but citizens suffered as well.  Food was not plentiful for many.

587 2018-02-14 02:24:00 Long before SNAP and Food Stamps, the Dep’t of Agrivu[ture gave out surplus cheese, peanut butter, corn oil
commodities and got overpaid for them.  Reinstating this would satisfy people who think SNAP recipients eat lobster

588 2018-02-14 02:22:06 Looks just like the commodities we had as kids.
589 2018-02-14 02:21:26 2/ We get the majority of our food through the area food bank, including what we receive under the federal TEFAP commodities program.  The amount we receive is based on the number of people we serve, and is doled out separately from the other food we get from the food bank.
590 2018-02-14 02:20:01 I need to learn more about commodities boxes and efforts to replace them with something better because holy shit, no one should have to live like that.
591 2018-02-14 02:19:46 My wife was raised on commodities. I'll be dam she made it to adulthood
592 2018-02-14 02:18:52 Commodities são muito correlacionadas c/ global growth, e rising treasuries yields. S&P menos. S&P subiu muito, em parte, pelo free money (yields em queda).

593 2018-02-14 02:17:40 Australia exports commodities.
We have no commodities. We export services.
It's easier to export commodities through trade deals and the WTO than it is services.

596 2018-02-14 02:15:15 Those commodities are still available on some Native American reservations. I disagree with them but so think we could build a better program following the WIC program model? Lots of choice but no soda pop or chips or garbage food
597 2018-02-14 02:10:12 Yes, living off of government commodities led to a Type 2 diabetic crisis among native populations. I could see these boxes being filled with cheap, high carb stuff like mac and cheese, sugared cereals, cans of creamed corn, etc.
598 2018-02-14 02:09:57 their employees’ salaries from them, even if they money’s being spent on drugs. Why? That’s coz we believe that as long as the payer is getting something—i.e. labour/other commodities—in return for their money, it doesn’t matter how the payee spends said money. Which shows 3/

603 2018-02-14 02:01:03 @chrislhayes don't you know that the government already delivers food in a box? It's called commodities, and they are delivered on the rez. They are filled with lard, salt, and sugar. I watched so many struggle and die from diabetes as an EMT, because of that crappy food.
604 2018-02-14 02:00:57 @chrislhayes @JoyAnnReid American Indians have lived w/commodities food distribution for decades Food chosen for them & suffer from highest levels of diabetes as result This is BIG FOOD Disgusting corporate pocketing of taxpayer $$ to look like they are solving "welfare" problem
605 2018-02-14 02:00:42 Anyone who knows anything about commodities on the Rez knows that this is very fucking much America.
606 2018-02-14 02:00:38 This crap is not even as good as the commodities boxes of the 1960s. The cheese, that canned chicken, flour, some really good things. This is all processed garbage!
607 2018-02-14 01:59:46 Haven't heard of Trump proposal to give SNAP recipients a box of provisions they're discussing on @chrislhayes right now. How is this different from commodities distribution?
608 2018-02-14 01:58:40 The government cheese was good and over the years i have gotten some good stuff on commodities. It sounds like Trump wants to go back to the days before food stamps when commodities were just basic survival foods.

610 2018-02-14 01:57:37 I remember recieving something called commodities as a child.  We got some kind of mystery meat and really oily peanut butter.  Both were disgusting.  Went to bed hungry several nights. Sounds like a big step backwards.  Very sad.
611 2018-02-14 01:57:06 This has already been done. The food companies did not like it. Kennedy-Dole changed the USDA commodities programs in the 70s.
612 2018-02-14 01:56:44 I need more info on how they got this data, because the commodities aren't lining up like a recognizable diet.

614 2018-02-14 01:47:54 They used to have commodities instead of food stamps. It was excess of farm foods, not good quality. Same things, beans, butter, dry milk, dried eggs, flour and such. People were so thankful for it, nowadays they would turn up their noses. Liberals would faint.

616 2018-02-14 01:45:33 @Dave_MN My dad always called it Commodities?
617 2018-02-14 01:45:20 Capitalism thrives on  your addiction to its commodities, these commodities include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth etc etc
618 2018-02-14 01:44:19 Ok so when Trump brings back Commodities who gon let me get there block of Cheese and Grape Juice
619 2018-02-14 01:43:58 Did you know that native Americans on reservations still get commodities from the gov't.? It's just as humiliating for them as for other poor ppl.
620 2018-02-14 01:41:09 You can gamble the shirt off your own back in a game of poker if you can find someone willing to take up the bet. The shirt has inherent value depending on the person. Digital commodities have inherent value, as proven by counterstrike markets.
621 2018-02-14 01:40:41 It's the old fashioned cheese and peanut butter commodities.  Good food.
622 2018-02-14 01:40:30 My household lives on the commodities program instead of foodstamps. We eat healthy and nutritious meals,grow a garden.We're on fixed incomes.
623 2018-02-14 01:37:45 These are what have commonly been known as government commodities. Supplies are prob decades old.
624 2018-02-14 01:36:38 If they are sending Govt commodities that is food we have already paid for. Good idea.
625 2018-02-14 01:34:59 Capitalism has always been an ugliness under the surface but the current political environment is ripe for venal accommodators procuring human commodities for wealthy rapacious predators and their appetites.
626 2018-02-14 01:33:21 My mom fed us with what they then called "commodities". When she went to pick them up, she made sure that nobody could see the box.  She was so ashamed. THAT is what this plan is all about--shame. They want us to be so ashamed that we wont sign up.  #IDespiseRepublicans
627 2018-02-14 01:33:09 We had commodities back then and if people want assistance, then everyone should be grateful for what is given! The goal is self-sufficiency for those that can be gainfully employed!
628 2018-02-14 01:31:48 Welcome to the Native American reservation. It's called commodities.powdered milk, powdered eggs, canned meat, how about the box of cheese. It wasn't to bad. Canned juice. Oh yes, health issues.
629 2018-02-14 01:31:39 Back in the 70s it was called Commodities. We got 2 1 lb cans of mystery meat, 2 bags of macaroni, 2 cans of vegetables, 2 lbs of butter, 1 container of powdered eggs, 2 bags of pinto beans, 1 5lb block of American cheese & 1 lg container of powdered milk a mo.
630 2018-02-14 01:31:37 True story. I grew up on commodities. Processed cheese, powder milk etc. nothing cold. White labeled vegetables. Glad to have had them.  Thank GOD I don't need them now. But it has a way of humbling you and making you work your way out of poverty.
631 2018-02-14 01:31:01 commodities used to grow on trees in the form of crops for trade.
632 2018-02-14 01:26:32 Commodities are something you get to augment food stamps, not replace them. Trump, Mulvaney, and the GOP are just plain hateful and evil.
633 2018-02-14 01:25:51 However, the answer is not a box of commodities furnished by the government. I grew up a very poor child before food stamps. Pretty much all we got was government commodities. We had more days than I care to remember when we ate nothing. Restrict what can be purchased.
634 2018-02-14 01:25:19 Apparently, The Donald must have known about commodities when he was growing up. Probably some class at his elite prep school.  It worked pretty good in the mid 20th century but not sure it would be effective now. Would be a great add-on to assistance for those needing it.
635 2018-02-14 01:23:13 Over 20 percent of SNAP money goes to junk food. If 50% is commodities, and the rest is discretionary, how is that bad? It guarantees 50 % hits the target and cost of fraud drops by 50%,  WIC and free lunch where 70% fresh produce gets tossed continues. #outcomes #publichealth
636 2018-02-14 01:23:05 [Extremely not falling rate of profit voice] hey in lieu of ads please help us speculate on commodities
637 2018-02-14 01:22:57 Totally and now thanks to this article ppl can start thinking of them as commodities. Yay, America!
638 2018-02-14 01:21:39 That too!  My Grandmother could geniously transform those commodities with her garden items into delicious food.
639 2018-02-14 01:20:21 If I'm reading it right it will be commodity food that the tax payers have already paid for through farm subsidies. To me it looks like a win-win. We paid for it so use it to help ppl just like food banks provide commodities to less fortunate ppl.
640 2018-02-14 01:15:32 yep..and yep
Grew up on commodities, too. (Didn't realize that was the official name...I thought it was just what we called it in the hood)
641 2018-02-14 01:15:24 It's "commodities," like my father used to get once a month at the county distribution center.  Surplus food for poor people.  We got all kinds of crap; surplus C-rations, powdered eggs, meat in a can, and of course, government cheese.

Awful food then, awful idea now.
642 2018-02-14 01:14:48 Por isso q gosto de comparar o gsci. Belo ponto. Ele reflete a cesta de consumo de commodities vigente. Assim como a composição do S&P, do Ibovespa, e de qq índice de equities no mundo muda ao longo dos anos, seria tbem mais inteligente q a cesta de commodities tbem mudasse.
643 2018-02-14 01:14:25 Today in Khartoum, The Minister of Trade and I agreed that resumption of border trade with South Sudan will help combat the smuggling of commodities!
644 2018-02-14 01:10:18 It is NOT like Blue Apron. It's commodities -- like Indian people get on reservations. There is only so much you can do with a few cans of beans, a loaf of white bread, some peanut butter and no meat, fruit or fresh vegetables. Ask @B_Ehrenreich
645 2018-02-14 01:08:42 My Dad used to deliver food commodities in his community. He fought on Omaha Beach to help liberate Europe. But when able bodied men would sit on their front porches and complain about the food or tell him where to put it down without bothering to get up and help him....he quit.
646 2018-02-14 01:08:37 Blue Commodities, new business name, I call it! #nativetwitter #beentheredonethat #welcometoindiancountry #indigenousoutloud
647 2018-02-14 01:08:13 My grandma got it, too.  It was called “commodities” and she also gave it to the grandkids in college.

650 2018-02-14 01:04:37 We had this in CA when I was a kid.  Commodities

652 2018-02-14 01:00:51 John: "We subsidize a lot of our agriculture. Most of that goes to corn and soy, which are calorie dense. They're very cheap, but healthier food, like lettuce, is much more expensive. Unprocessed commodities need to be affordable options for everyone." #JohnToursThe12th
653 2018-02-14 01:00:18 Thank you. As a child in the 60 's I stood in line with my mom for "commodities." The public shaming was just as bad then, and in a small town all knew we got them. Powdered milk and eggs, greasy peanut butter... Mama did the best she could to make meals. She cried every time.
654 2018-02-14 01:00:05 I’m jealous. I remember when my tribe got government commodities. They were so good. I still feel the government owes the tribes these commodities. But if we make over 23K a year, we get zero.
655 2018-02-14 00:54:39 It's the commodity food program. Remember "government cheese"? It's not real cheese anymore, but those kind of commodities.
656 2018-02-14 00:54:09 Sad but true. Or 1/2 a month of grocery junk food, garbage in a box. Decent food & classes on how to cook from scratch w basic ingredients might help break the obesity/junk food addiction. I'm poor & sickly, was on commodities for yrs. It was decent food,  and I was thankful.
657 2018-02-14 00:54:09 "El precio de los commodities ha mejorado un poco, el crecimiento de China se ha mantenido más o menos constante" Carlos Végh del @BancoMundialLAC en #EntrelaEspadaylaPared
658 2018-02-14 00:53:15 Here’s the thing...they used to have this in  the 1970’s. They called them commodities.  No one delivered them.  My mom would have to hitchhik (we didn’t have a car)  into town with three small children to go to the AFS office to pick up the box. It was all government rations.
659 2018-02-14 00:52:54 During the '80s, my husband was in the army and we qualified to receive the surplus commodities from the USDA.  Government cheese, flour, powdered milk, powdered eggs, dry beans.  Also WIC when I was pregnant & breastfeeding after the baby was born.  We probably qualified...
660 2018-02-14 00:52:41 so.... 45 wants to put mainstream 'murica on commodities to save a few bucks on SNAP. 

the savings would be miniscule as 45 would need to tap current infrastructure and delivery systems (a fixed cost) or create all new ones to meet demand.
661 2018-02-14 00:47:02 Not to mention they’re also trying to defund or have defunded programs like senior commodities.
662 2018-02-14 00:43:52 I am a fan of #snap benefit changes, problem with delivering food is the recipients sell the food. I witnessed it first hand with commodities and the Native Americans. Drive around sell the food to get cash for other goods #USDA
663 2018-02-14 00:43:38 The current admin wants to replace SNAP (food stamps) with a blue apron type box with hi calorie , low nutrition commodities. Nothing green here. You need to check out this stream @AnnieLowrey #snap
664 2018-02-14 00:41:51 Oh My Goodness, mr. Fowler you didn’t just go there ?Ppl stand in line for free commodities the gov hands out and you’re telling the audience this is wrong & how would you get it to them ? They’ve always managed to find a ride before now. Please
665 2018-02-14 00:40:12 @scottlincicome What kind of affect would the Trump budget SNAP proposal have on commodities prices if it were enacted?
666 2018-02-14 00:38:30 SNAP recipients deserve the choices we all have - regardless oh how it’s paid for. This box o shit nothin but ick govt commodities. Stop punishing folks cuz their poor.
667 2018-02-14 00:38:10 They're bringing back commodities...
668 2018-02-14 00:37:23 I grew up in poverty and when we received “commodities” (boxed food) I loved  them.  It was when I was a 12yo and if mom wasn’t home we had food and I could cook for my younger siblings. #FoodBox @realDonaldTrump
669 2018-02-14 00:37:01 So, the Trump wants to take away food stamps and replace it with “food boxes” aka commodities and save over $120 billion over the next ten years.

This is coming after budget cut proposals and a tax scam that are set up to make the rich richer. But uh, let’s MAGA right?
670 2018-02-14 00:35:36 Gaze up at polarized commodities and omnipresent singularities,
 #poetry #art
671 2018-02-14 00:34:08 Yep. Commodities. Good old bad old gummint cheese- like Velveeta, only less flavor, with a horrid chalky almost plastic-ey undertaste. And generic spam- even greasier! And powdered milk. And beans. And white flour.
672 2018-02-14 00:33:12 The proof points keep mounting for battery minerals demand. Car makers  have spent billions on plants to build cars they worry they can’t get  the commodities for. Physical cobalt prices were up last week during the  “correction”. We’re still early cycle.
673 2018-02-14 00:31:40 Does any one remembers government commodities?  Cheese, butter, rice, beans, oatmeal, powdered milk..my parents never received food stamps but during my childhood I can remember my parents getting them and it really helped.
674 2018-02-14 00:30:12 When I was a kid I lived in a state that didn’t have food stamps.  We were able to receive “commodities”.  There was only 3 of us in the household so we were only able to get them every 3 months.  I would make oatmeal with the Karo syrup and powdered milk. Dried goods had weaves
675 2018-02-14 00:28:47 grew up eating "commodities" as we called them. Plain labelled food like RICE, CEREAL, and the every infamous Gov't Cheese
676 2018-02-14 00:26:18 "Dear friends, the rations are small and usually frozen, and I am almost too weak to write. But anyway, about the price convergence of commodities in early modern Europe..."
677 2018-02-14 00:24:09 My family received food from the Gov in the early 50s. It was called commodities in those days, and included, dried beans flour, canned meats, flour, cheese, powered milk, powered eggs and rice. We all grew up healthy and are productive middle class ppl today.
678 2018-02-14 00:23:48 They were called "commodities" in my youth, and now they're trying out "Blue Apron" because that sounds a lot sexier than telling you to go down to the mill and pick up a box of generic powdered milk and a big bag of rice.  #hoboheretic  Enjoy.
679 2018-02-14 00:15:35 I remember in the old days my parents old friends would get commodities.They would receive so much damn boxed cheese that there was no way they could eat it all.The would give my parents boxes of velvetta because my parents had 8 kids & even we couldn’t eat all that crap cheese.
680 2018-02-14 00:12:26 I still have #Soybean $ZS_F #Wheat $ZW_F & #Corn $ZC_F position. I was riding Soymeal for a while - & have taken that off for now, missed a bit of the last few day strength, but can't win them all. Overall higher #Grains is a good sign for #Commodities & #Ags #FX in general.
681 2018-02-14 00:12:03 I remember commodities some of the stuff was better than you CAN buy,and betraying my age I also remember army surplus powdered eggs and such pretty good stuff for cooking.
682 2018-02-14 00:11:45 This! We had the commodities from the gummint when I was growing up: long block of "cheese," peanut butter, rice, powdered milk, powdered mashed potatoes. All were less than appetizing. All were stigmatizing. At least today's SNAP cards are nearly invisible.
683 2018-02-14 00:11:43 GMO’s are here, and they are the future. Our ability to feed the billions more to come are dependent on them. The problem is the capitalists who only see them as commodities.
684 2018-02-14 00:08:09 I DO remember commodities in WV. Both my parents worked, we did our best, but we still struggled.  Government cheese, powdered eggs, sausage in a can...SO many things in cans. And the long lines...

You're suggesting we bring back bread lines. 

Do us all a favor and stay in FL.
685 2018-02-14 00:07:55 JUST LIKE IT WAS BEFORE FOOD STAMPS.WE GOT A COUPLE OF BOXES OF COMMODITIES.PRE-70'S.
686 2018-02-14 00:04:53 What the Trump Adminis proposing to do to SNAP recipients is how “food” — commodities — is distributed on Native Am Reservations. This is NOT Blue Apron.
687 2018-02-14 00:03:43 Food banks already have Goverment commodities they give to families one time per month..noodles, canned food, peanut butter, chicken. It varies weekly. Not enough food to feed the family of five for a month. Research.....
688 2018-02-14 00:02:53 It's a shaming tactic for the poor. I remember those long lines winding down city streets. I asked mom what that was, she told me "commodities" for the poor; another word for "surplus" programs. Rain, snow, broiling heat they were out there waiting and waiting
689 2018-02-14 00:02:09 Why do you have to "make a deal" this is their lives! These are young people for the most part brought here not by their choice,they have known no other country ! Surely their lives are worth thoughtful consideration and compassion! They are not commodities to be bargained!
690 2018-02-14 00:00:33 I remember. My grandparents got these "commodities". Powdered eggs - ewwwww.
