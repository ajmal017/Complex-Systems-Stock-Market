You can NEVER win your fight against "big oil" companies.

Let me tell you save up, purchase stocks/bonds/CDs & flip that money. 

Don’t live check to check cause that return be something serious !
5 2019-01-10 23:53:34 Lol, you could say that same thing about hundreds of stocks lately, but backing up the truck to buy bottoms is not a great habit to get in. Just my take.
6 2019-01-10 23:53:33 1. Deal does not get voted through. 2. Country goes into meltdown. 3. Stocks tumble and pound devalued by 25%. 4. We hold a snap ref to get Scotland the fuck out of the shambles. 5. Independence voted by 80%. 6. We rejoin EU and Edinburgh becomes a huge financial centre  done

8 2019-01-10 23:51:36 thx @ukarlewitz Stocks roll over well before official recessions, correct? Stocks discount the economy's (economies'?) future, not the reverse. #BakesTakes_
9 2019-01-10 23:51:27 I think that's right because I recall having two different Harvey Kuenn's from that set era (two different card stocks, white & gray) and he sure wasn't a slugger.
10 2019-01-10 23:50:31 As the stocks rise so do twitter beefs. @VancityReynolds just wanted to let you know that my friend actually took a dump while watching Deadpool2 in the movie theater. All I’m trying to say I invite you to Vegas and stay up all 7 days/nights doing hell knows what
11 2019-01-10 23:50:25 @DavidAsmanfox J. Hoenig (howdy doody) only cares about his stocks. Supports anti Trump chamber of commerce.
Hoenig says 9/11 was an emergency. No it was a catastrophy. I guess Hoenig doesn't think that people who die every day from drugs coming in is ok.
12 2019-01-10 23:49:25 I think Petes aim is to bring awarness to the sector and start a dialogue around certain stocks. Nothing replaces someone's own research and the viewers know that. I think it adds value.
13 2019-01-10 23:49:03 @realDonaldTrump some of us are well aware of why you switched from a concrete wall to a steel one, the art of the deal is a CON. Blue stocks and pink sheets.  #EndCorruptionNow #investments #wolfofwashington
14 2019-01-10 23:48:24 Fadlan waa codsi inteey goori goor tahay before it is too late. revoke that chinese fishing license. 30 chinese trawlers fishing in our seas will deplete our stocks.
15 2019-01-10 23:48:11 This is weekly support & buy has to be from weekly or monthly with the understanding of running into daily R ahead.. Stocks are for long term investment for me when i buy it & everyone has a different style of buying/holding/selling etc...
16 2019-01-10 23:47:29 #ChiringuitoBarcelona Señores, parece que veis desde la grada Worten.
Antes de cualquier toque, al delantero se les afloja los stocks, ya tenía claro que pitará penalty.
17 2019-01-10 23:47:18 Getting in touch with my broker; need to double up on popcorn stocks.
18 2019-01-10 23:47:06 To the stocks with you.
19 2019-01-10 23:45:09 They will reverse and reverse hard. This is all an orchestrated pump, starting with oil to ramp credit to ramp stocks. They all have the same charts. And they are all WAY overestended and losing momentum
