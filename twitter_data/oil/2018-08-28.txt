Not only made khamenei fund Assad regime and pay for their own military adventure and took over oil and gas assets, it was a good advertisement for Russian military hardware and weapons secured major sales

16 2018-08-28 23:56:28 @TomJMO you must obviously see that not merely Kenyan politics, but rather, the world at large. If Kenya finds any real 'coudlron' of oil, for instance, & determines to keep it, chances are likely that Kenya will be determined a "harbour of terrorists". Need I say more?

You British need a Trump in a bad way.
40 2018-08-28 23:54:42 Oil prices crashed during Obj regime but he did the much he can do. It is not about crash in oil prices but implementing a good policy. If it has been handled well things can be so bad like this.
41 2018-08-28 23:54:31 you missed my point.  Tobacco was known to be harmful, Tobacco companies hid this fact from the public, but no CEO's went to jail for this.  Sadly, same with Big Oil.  They've known for 50 years that they are warming the planet, they hid this at first, later attempted to deny it.
42 2018-08-28 23:53:53 
43 2018-08-28 23:53:48 I'm sure there's a nice oil rig in the gulf to turn into a paradise.
44 2018-08-28 23:53:04 Already regretting the oil change I scheduled for tomorrow cause that means I have to talk to people about my car. And both those things are very stressful for me

59 2018-08-28 23:50:38 CBD oil can be such a huge help for PTSD, and chronic pain conditions - I use it for both and it’s been life changing.

61 2018-08-28 23:50:25 Salt pepper, drizzle of olive oil and splash apple cider vinegar.  Coat evenly. Couple of minutes on each side on grill.  Mix some brown sugar and chili powder in a small bowl and toss scallops in mixture. Serve
62 2018-08-28 23:50:21 No mention either of oil price going up & NZ$ down. But then again the Nats are not that competent on financial matters.

70 2018-08-28 23:48:59 Cut back on the coconut oil,Gabe.
71 2018-08-28 23:48:54 I did try the CBD oil in a control experiment and I did get a slight buzz so I would recommend a small dosage first Will.
72 2018-08-28 23:48:50 Where tf can i get an oil change at this time ?!
73 2018-08-28 23:48:43 Yeh we’re the uUS second biggest trading partner. We should start selling hydro to US at Canadian rates. We should quit being the biggest purchaser of US steel. We should sell China a $1billion worth of oil/month which is the amount China buys from US instead of selling to US
74 2018-08-28 23:48:24 They forgot to put oil pan to catch drip
75 2018-08-28 23:48:19 I have added terpene's to the corner of a paper towel and placed it in my bag of herb for min 30 min and accomplished the same deal without placing any oil on the herb itself . I even tweaked tobacco for the hell of it . Terps are amazing to mess with . #PlantScience #Works4Me

81 2018-08-28 23:48:07 I live near fracking. It damages groundwater and pollutes the air. It is actually worse than oil. That doesn't include the damage to the local infrastructure and the rise in crime rates.
82 2018-08-28 23:47:41 No not at all. This may be ridiculous but I like having my oil changed in my vehicles every 3500-4000 Miles. I’m going to still take it to Toyota for the Routine maintenance for the warranty. But definitely not going to wait every 10k Miles to change the oil. 
83 2018-08-28 23:47:10 Oh snap, you telling me to oil up??? 

Or are you telling me to change the oil in my car, cause if so I still have 3,500 miles left to go lol

90 2018-08-28 23:45:49 Funny. Squirting water is actually a good idea. Adds moisture to the food while giving the sizzle for presentation. Oil too dangerous to serve. Fajitas cooked on grill anyway.

125 2018-08-28 23:40:50 It's almost as tasty as proper microwave popcorn. You can control the salt. It needs the butter because there is no other steam or oil. So the salt doesn't stick if there's no butter. (I love butter, so I'm fine w this.)

151 2018-08-28 23:37:22 So your oil point wasn't really relevant in the matter then.

I get the reasons suggested for the lack of development in Africa. Agricultural bootstrap wasn't there as it was elsewhere.
152 2018-08-28 23:37:20 Oh nah, I don’t trust myself or any other place to change my oil after the little situation I went through the other day 
153 2018-08-28 23:37:18 I get fused up with anger at this GDP report, when oil booms, should the economy be left out?...  innovation  uplifts a nation not #GDP

156 2018-08-28 23:37:02 Yes, but then again, so is buying the wrong peoples oil, the wrong peoples gas...
157 2018-08-28 23:36:54 I have my own car I bought MYSELF. But my mom just gave me one of her cars she got it smoged paid 4 the tags a tune up breaks & oil change so sweet of her! Then She calls me back to tell me she just bought myself new car since I was waiting here. Lmao crazy lady. Mush be nice
158 2018-08-28 23:36:40 So true. I had the pleasure of cooking 4 my wife tonight so left the TV on w/@FoxNews on. Before I had a chance to change channels I heard that clown & had 2 let him know the idiot oil he is drinking is going 2 do him in. For sure he is lower than a catfish sucking the on bottom!

161 2018-08-28 23:36:05 Has nothing to do with oil. The guy can't talk, can't read, admits he is slow, his performance reflects his lack of vigor.

163 2018-08-28 23:35:52 Always amazing to read how part of conditions are to give US companies a stake in the oil trade as if the United States is entitled to the property of other nations.

So gut the oil & gas sector. Run off all big investment. Drive a stake through the Auto industry....

169 2018-08-28 23:35:24 When I was 18, I visited Cartagena, Colombia, my family's ancestral city. I ate a hot beef empanada on the beach. The sea salt on my fingers mixed with the oil and salsita and I couldn't eat that deliciousness fast enough. I savored the next one.
170 2018-08-28 23:35:22 Resources? We’re not interested in your Irn Bru..... but if you mean your oil, well, that’ll run out - then what?
171 2018-08-28 23:34:40 I’ve used the the b-hydra which is mediocre, the marula oil broke me out, la la retro is also mediocre, c-firma I like but I’m not seeing big results, probably won’t repurchase.. I think I like other vita c products more. The framboos is my favorite, immediate and great results.
172 2018-08-28 23:34:35 So would I.
Solar reduces energy cost.
China created entire region of solar area.
China will be without need of oil.
S.A. same.
Countless nations now moving toward no oil consumption.

177 2018-08-28 23:33:41 How many people need to die because we need to wait? Even the Saudis know that oil is going away and they are making plans for its demise. Coal was replaced around WW I. England was slow to change over and the US surpassed them as a world power.
178 2018-08-28 23:33:41 Beda jenis nya sih nder. Kalo kleveru kan face oil, kalo scrub St Ives kan exfoliator. Tapi bisa sama2 bersihin sihh

188 2018-08-28 23:33:03 Thanks for admitting that you only care about your gun, nothing else.

It's what we always say about gun nuts. So, good for you. Eat your gun if you ever find yourself starving to death. And drink some oil. It's good for ya.
189 2018-08-28 23:33:03 YES! Been a pleasure working with #asburyPark as they become @littoralsociety  "Champions of the #Coast"! No to oil & gas! No intentional balloon releases! And yes to smart #oceanPlanning!!

191 2018-08-28 23:32:53 Let's look at all the other countries that have a nationalized oil supply: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Mexico, Ecuador, Russia, and Canada. What do they have in common? A lot of censoring and overly controlling governments. Venezuela is no exception here

201 2018-08-28 23:31:30 I discussed "mandate" vs "goal".

All economic legislation, or it's lack, picks winners and losers. e.g. CA is the only state that does not charge oil producers an extraction tax, favoring them.

Avoiding renewables, knowing oil is finite & usage growing, takes us over a cliff.
202 2018-08-28 23:31:27 Nice! I see your family favors the cheese & veggies pizza. Mine is the traditional pepperoni & 4 cheeses, or olive oil, buffalo mozzarella, parmesean & arugula.

228 2018-08-28 23:28:10 If they even support it? What Petro seems to be is a way for the government to generate revenue in a country drowning in debt. Remember the government controls the oil sonanything related to oil and gas goes back into the hands of an already corrupt government.

258 2018-08-28 23:23:47 Africans have abundant natural resources and have been in the region for a long time compared to the Norwegians.

Oil is particularly abundant in Nigeria so by your reasoning it should be a developed country? 

You are refuting your own points.
259 2018-08-28 23:23:42 I'm hoping that when I get my oil changed this weekend that the dudes also tell me whats leaking out of my car so I can get it fixed.... I just want my car to run forever

286 2018-08-28 23:18:57 Relaxing? Essential oils diffuser bought on sale last year. Never used one before. With air quality in NW unpacked and plugged it in last night. The orange oil was nice - I kept thinking kitchen needed cleaning. Lemongrass today is making my nose twitch. Just took allergy pill.
287 2018-08-28 23:18:54 Can't happen soon enough,stick it to the big oil...
288 2018-08-28 23:18:24 Don't worry, you can get pumpkin spice practically *anything* these days. Want pumpkin spice potato chips? No problem! You can probably get pumpkin spice motor oil!
289 2018-08-28 23:18:14 And oil worth almost 1T
290 2018-08-28 23:18:13 It's weird because they are like water and oil
291 2018-08-28 23:18:08 #NewBluehand #Bluehand After pushing to shrink protected land, an Interior Dept. official is leaving to be a lobbyist at BP — one of the biggest oil companies. The government-to-lobbying revolving door spins faster & faster under realDonaldTrump. Time to #EndCorruptionNow. …
292 2018-08-28 23:17:38 #UPDATE: I can now confirm the Russian navy has 10 warships and 2 submarines in the Eatern Mediterranean near the Tartous Russian Naval base now: 1 cruiser, 1 destroyer, 4 frigates, 3 corvettes, 1 oil replenishment ship and 2 submarines. Thanks to @BabakTaghvaee for the details
293 2018-08-28 23:17:28 Simon when oil went down to 30 bucks a barrel we still were paying almost GFC prices . I didn’t hear any National MPs saying a God Damned thing #nzpol

295 2018-08-28 23:16:37 Learning to change a tire, change oil, and perform basic maintenance on your car should be on the drivers test.

I really don't know why its not...
296 2018-08-28 23:16:16 Tax remittances to Mexico. They rely on that money even more than oil.
297 2018-08-28 23:16:14 And may I add Duterte and the Myanmar military. By comparison Trump is merely an arrogant self-promoting loud mouth. A snake oil salesman.
298 2018-08-28 23:15:55 Her warmongering and pandering to Wall Street donors showed her interests were as selfish as Trumps and her support of fracking and big oil as egregious.  She was ready to kill more people in the middle.east, more in Africa, more in America by stifling a single payer movement.
299 2018-08-28 23:15:51 Seems interesting read, but I disagree with strong Sapir-Whorf implication here. It is more likely that French language was “club” language at that time. Considering most of France didn’t speak French (Oc, oil, Breton), aristocracy simply had their own secret verbal handshake
300 2018-08-28 23:15:49 Doesn't that imply that African's had a head start? 

Nigeria has massive oil reserves.
301 2018-08-28 23:15:47 I smoke a cbd oil pen. ThoughtCloud
302 2018-08-28 23:15:46 I made a grilled cheese on rye, sliced Jersey tomato with sea salt, olive oil and balsamic glaze. Pickle.
303 2018-08-28 23:15:46 I finally got the oil that smell like Arje lol I’ve always loved her scent
304 2018-08-28 23:15:19 I think it does...I always add like 3x what my wife thinks I should...plus I usually throw in like a tbsp of olive oil

306 2018-08-28 23:14:36 WTI Oil …..The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported an oil inventory build of 38,000 barrels of inventories for week  8/25/18  …@jonnajarian @CNBCFuturesNow @ScottNations @BrianStutland @jimcramer
307 2018-08-28 23:14:27 I smell the chest to be your oil flowering farther down than your bloc cupped riding on flours of ambrosia
308 2018-08-28 23:14:25 Some oils can increase the skins blood circulation but it might be just a unintended effect. Vitamin E oil supposedly prevents/removes stretch marks but i'm not 100% sure theres just too much to remember at once ^^
309 2018-08-28 23:14:21 ケンタッキースキン出てほしいです(´；ω；｀)
310 2018-08-28 23:14:08 I certainly don't agree that it's "pure poison," but I think the health benefits they originally claimed were overstated. I use it in moderation. I think it's healthier than the highly processed oils out there, like corn oil & soybean oil. But, I prefer olive or avocado oil.
311 2018-08-28 23:13:58 This Castor oil >>
312 2018-08-28 23:13:45 Sakita ana uy akong gitambal lang gud sauna bie kay gibutngan ni mamag baby oil akog dunggan aron mamatay sa sulod tapos malumos mana niya mo gawas
313 2018-08-28 23:13:40 Is nicotine a essential oil 
314 2018-08-28 23:13:35 So Iran controls the flow of Oil in the Middle East right now. The reason is because if a war breaks out in that region then the shipping lines basically shutdown closing off commerce and insurance along those shipping lines. Price of oil changes over night.
315 2018-08-28 23:13:22 ごま油。。。くっそ。
316 2018-08-28 23:13:17 Woke up later than usual pero may time pa talaga ko mag-apply ng oil sa hair ko at i-cover sya sa shower cap for 30 mins. bago ako maligo kahit start na ng class ko in ~45 mins.
317 2018-08-28 23:13:09 If I call you phone and your boyfriend pick it up ima say 
This me jones from knockover oil company you still looking for a job 
318 2018-08-28 23:12:59 Its a great thing that my boyfriend knows about cars that he does my oil change and helps me w it :) <3

320 2018-08-28 23:12:47 Theres a group of white boys in my arabi class who are interested in the culture(not in a fetishing way) then there’s a group that want to learn Arabi to understand mideastern politics&eventually steal oil& cause mass destruction I believe these are the only 2 defaults of a white
321 2018-08-28 23:12:21 They should do what they did to Standard Oil.
322 2018-08-28 23:12:20 Mac-n-cheese with tuna, teeny onions, and peas. Use olive oil packed tuna and put in the oil instead of butter. DELIGHT
323 2018-08-28 23:12:10 Not sure what in “prison terms”,this means exactly, but why afford him the luxury of Olive Oil?
324 2018-08-28 23:12:02 Nah I mainly smoke glass & smoke blunts like 95% less than I used to. But even vaping chokes me. Except this vape my coworker got from the dispensary that uses oil that I’m finna cop as soon as she gets back from med leave. But dabbing hurts, glass, papers & especially blunts.
325 2018-08-28 23:12:01 Blame LBJ and NSA they were in charge and BLAME the attackers Isreal. I read it all in “body of secrets”   Otherwise blame every soldier in Desert storm for BUSHes actions of oil power plays 1991 and 2003
326 2018-08-28 23:12:00 You are exactly who trump was thinking of with his "I love the uneducated"

Because you're easy marks for a conman.

You just keep buying his snake oil
327 2018-08-28 23:11:49 Fish oil, vitamin D, and magnesium. That goes for you too, @dongillette
328 2018-08-28 23:11:43 The only reason the looney is “strongish” it’s because oil price is up.
329 2018-08-28 23:11:35 If you think CBD oil is bad for you you're a fucking idiot
330 2018-08-28 23:11:33 バカだよ
331 2018-08-28 23:11:22 Monday: Tire Bursted, Bought 2- $160

Today: Front tires snap belts- $160
Oil change: $50 (I hate CarX but it was my only option)

Check engine light is on, now I need a tune up and serpentine belt- $380

Valve stem was split so tire sensor needs replaced- $180

Im gonna lay down
332 2018-08-28 23:11:08 Yeah buddy, need to check the oil every 500-1000miles to see how much is burning off if any.
333 2018-08-28 23:11:07 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
334 2018-08-28 23:10:56 Oregano oil will help they sell them in tablet form

336 2018-08-28 23:10:45 Good dodge on the fact that people were becoming less nourished under capitalism. 
Anyway, look up how Reagan intentionally isolated the Soviet economy and artificially drove down oil prices, which the USSR got a lot of its wealth from.

338 2018-08-28 23:10:39 for over 200 000 years shows that she has no understanding of history or geography. It's literally directly related to the point she makes. Norway was a poor farming nation until he hit the ultimate jackpot and found massive oil reserves, which artificially sped up our dev.

340 2018-08-28 23:10:31 Governments go out of their way to target civilians.  Have since at least WWII.

That's what makes all these "humanitarian" wars like Syria and Libya ridiculous narratives.

It's no coincidence that the instability of region sits on vast oil reserves.  It's all about greed.

344 2018-08-28 23:10:09 That sounds amazing. Good evening. I just finished work for the day (I work in the energy sector, oil and natural gas). :) In 1st year undergrad before I was at Harvard, I was really interested in cell biology (bioinformatics was my major with a minor in chemistry and RS).
345 2018-08-28 23:10:08 Everything is renewable eventually.  Just might take a couple hundred million years for more plankton and algae to turn to oil
346 2018-08-28 23:09:56 It helps everyone. It’s Canada’s number one economic export. The world won’t be off oil for decades if ever. Get over the virtue signalling and let the Country fund our social programs. After all Canada is a leader in renewables world wide. Quit biting the hand that feeds us.
347 2018-08-28 23:09:50 Coconut oil will help with inflammation and healing. It's also good for the hair, you won't need much to rub it in.
348 2018-08-28 23:09:49 To murder countless amounts of people so they can have access to the countless oil reserves?
349 2018-08-28 23:09:39 nope - just roasted it in good olive oil + onions + garlic + bacon
350 2018-08-28 23:09:34 Poor McJesus....soon enough Oil will have yet another coach and GM. This org can't get out of it's own way...
351 2018-08-28 23:09:15 Coconut oil works very well tbh
352 2018-08-28 23:09:07 Other sport but great name, “oil can” Boyd from the Red Sox I believe. Learned about him when I was young and never forgot that name.
353 2018-08-28 23:08:59 And where will I be getting this money??? Beard balm for what?? Use castor oil. It's tough
354 2018-08-28 23:08:54 As much fun as I had this weekend I was also soooo fucking stressed & constantly around people whilst not getting any sleep or feeding myself enough. 

Tonight’s agenda include lots of vegan Chinese food, coconut oil, @tarabusicreek skincare & lotzzzz of water. SELFCARE
355 2018-08-28 23:08:29 Try CBD oil! It has changed my sleep life.
356 2018-08-28 23:08:19 oo i had never heard of sesame oil! but you’re probably right abt it being a rip off :/ lmao i’m gonna try to find it! thank youuu
357 2018-08-28 23:08:09 missing the lanes sa Funland, the smell of fresh and clean oil 
358 2018-08-28 23:08:00 Ladies I have a hair care tip for u!!!! Put coconut oil in your hair and massage it root to tip. Wrap it up in a towel and leave it overnight. Wake up & wash it out and boyyyy it feels fantastic
359 2018-08-28 23:07:48 Took my 4Runner to Toyota today for its first 5000 mile maintenance. And I didn’t know this but they don’t change the oil until 10k miles. Like, whoa! That’s a new one on me. 
360 2018-08-28 23:07:45 Twenty first century snake oil
361 2018-08-28 23:07:38 There’s a difference between a man getting in to the swimming pool in trunks & as the Daily Mirror headline said, ‘CBB girls squirt cream & oil on their boobs to ‘arouse viewers’ in filthy striptease task’.  Spot the difference?
362 2018-08-28 23:07:33 It did to an extent. There would be weeks where the fish oil would work then he would have set back and his ears would swell back up and his eyes would puff up and Id have to give him allergy meds. Gave in to the CBD and it has worked these past 2 months.
363 2018-08-28 23:07:22 the straw thing is based off a 9 year olds report he conducted via phone. feel good PR to ban and makes life harder for disabled people. nonpoint source pollution (predominately fertilizer, motor oil, herbicides, and drainage from mines) is #1 in ocean pollution
364 2018-08-28 23:06:38 Paying for the capping of the Scottish North Sea oil wells, it will amount to more money than Scotland has paid to Westminster in total. Scotland is lucky they have Westminster to pay the 70 BILLION for this. Just one example why Scottish Cringe should wake up.
365 2018-08-28 23:06:37 The war on Christmas progresses well as we continue our march on the arctic. With each passing summer we weaken the foundations of the fat man's workshop. Soon, we will have our victory, we will have our CEO's BB gun and we will have the oil on the arctic floor #tytlive
366 2018-08-28 23:06:34 I really do love that it's a perspective shift depending on the orientation. Either give or take. Is it hard painting with oil?
367 2018-08-28 23:06:26 I’ll be run over by some donkey-cap on an electric bicycle who is to busy checking his/her “vintage” iPhone to see where he/she is going. 

I will die covered I latte, beard oil and hipster tears 
368 2018-08-28 23:06:25 Olive oil! 
369 2018-08-28 23:06:22 I read it happens when some of the oil in the shot gets into the bloodstream and to the lungs. Completely reversible but can cause fainting and other side effects
370 2018-08-28 23:06:16 Under the most happy circumstances, I cannot give light for another hour unless fresh oil of grace is given to me.

371 2018-08-28 23:05:52 In present Us-Chaina trade war, Indian goverment should take initiative and talk to china government for direct export of fishmeal and fish oil to china.Komkan region will be benefited directly. @DoC_GoI @sureshpprabhu .
372 2018-08-28 23:05:40 Do people still get hot oil treatments?
373 2018-08-28 23:05:32 Today someone asked me what I wanted for Christmas, and I literally told them if they can pay for my oil change and a tune up for my car that’ll be great. I’m officially a mf adult like yessssss this shit ain’t no joke .. fuck all that other shit , give me what I REALLY NEED.
374 2018-08-28 23:05:32 Go Pro lenses-Drone optics--all need regular #opticalcleaning to maintain pristine conditions for optimum imaging. Nothing better than #ROR to do the job-- the only Residual Oil Remover that gets that grimy residue off lens surfaces--the difference is "CLEAR"!!!
375 2018-08-28 23:05:19 It's too hot. Felt like 100+deg today w heatwave.
@TheRealTriscuit black pepper+olive oil crackers, red pepper hummus, and @HaagenDazs_US pistachio ice cream for dinner.
Yup. #notashamed #toohot
376 2018-08-28 23:05:16 Gotta get that holy oil out!
377 2018-08-28 23:04:52 I am saying USA bombed Iraq caliming they had mass destruction weapons just for their oil.
They will have a solid case when Sudan's turn eventually comes 
378 2018-08-28 23:04:43 Seriously.
Full spectrum cannabis oil.
THC KILLS tumors.
Not derived cannabis based drugs... 
Grow flowers, dry flowers, heat flowers to 240° F for 15 minutes.
Mix crushed flowers well with 95% ETHYL alcohol. 
Strain off the alcohol.

381 2018-08-28 23:04:11 ... So I guess It’s a good trait to be forceful and unpredictable after all the presidency is a Bully pulpit. A perfect example is Theodore Roosevelt who broke the power of Rockefeller’s standard oil monopoly, He once said: wield a BIG stick but speak softly.....
382 2018-08-28 23:04:05 indeed.  but how likely is that to happen?  Seeing as how big oil and our government are intertwined.  How many tobacco CEO's and former CEO's went to jail because their research proved that smoking kills people and they hid that research?
383 2018-08-28 23:04:02 Cranky Oil Baron of Man Kind
384 2018-08-28 23:03:58 Just watched an episode of #TheBRAVE I saw a series that fails to carry out research before they shot a movie and certainly have no eye for details  firstly the group MEND was a Niger Delta militancy group  operated mainly in Niger Delta destroyed oil facilities, holding a store
385 2018-08-28 23:03:45 The oil isn't in use anymore, so youre in the clear. Feel free to eat as many eggrolls as you like.
386 2018-08-28 23:03:39 Indecisive Theresa May along with her ridiculous dance moves showing her true colours incapable of making any decisions, flip flops on everything. The most hopeless PM. To think this women is in charge of Brexit is shocking. You wouldn’t let a learner steer a oil loaded tanker.
387 2018-08-28 23:03:39 ち〇こと迷ったけど思いとどまった私を褒めて
388 2018-08-28 23:03:14 Yeah, somebody dumped a load of used grease and food oil.
389 2018-08-28 23:03:13 Far more simple.

After the end of slavery (Due to the industrial Revolution)

The former Slavers rushed into Africa to carve up the continent for it's valuable resources.

Oil - for motor cars  + Rubber for car tyres. & More.

Since then the West has resourced it's development
390 2018-08-28 23:03:08 How hot is it? 

My coconut oil is fully melted
391 2018-08-28 23:02:52 my tea tree oil is one of the most important things i own. idgaf about what it can do for acne it's a natural bug repellant (INCLUDING LICE!!!!!!!!!! ARM YOURSELVES!!!!!)
392 2018-08-28 23:02:46 Was ever thus, when was the last time a trade delegation to Saudi Arabia pointed out that they’re backwards barbaric c*nts? Never while there’s oil to buy and guns to sell.
393 2018-08-28 23:02:42 It's just oil, I know I'm a mortal but I'm not made of glass... I'll happily eat them though.
394 2018-08-28 23:02:24 I have dry earwax, and I do the qtips but dipped in oil (like coconut or even baby) and it feels so good

401 2018-08-28 23:01:07 My car doesn’t have a dip stick . The computer tells me when I need to change my oil or when it’s low .
402 2018-08-28 23:01:06 Learned this one from my ex brother in law. Dip her in a little oil to lube and clean. Dandy.
403 2018-08-28 23:01:00 Next time keep us out of your referendum, we want to dissolve the union, and stop bailing you incompetent chinless Brit yahoos out with our exports of  oil, whisky, gas, fish, beef, and electricity. Those goodies down there are welcome up here. Bye.

410 2018-08-28 23:00:02 The US government is not a friend of the Venezuelan people. It exists to help its corporations exploit and plunder the people and resources of countries around the world. US corporations can't stand the fact that they can't get their hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves.
411 2018-08-28 23:00:00 Oh goodo - you'll be making Climate Change a priority then, because neither Australians nor anybody else on this planet has a future as long as our representatives continue being stupid about coal and oil rather than having the guts to do what MUST be done NOW.
412 2018-08-28 22:59:50 so i bought this cooling shampoo & im actually obsessed. it makes your head tingle, and smells amazing. what is it you ask? head and shoulders filling shampoo and conditioner with tea tree oil. no, i don’t have dandruff i just love their shampoo
413 2018-08-28 22:59:42 Ain't nun slick to a can of oil
414 2018-08-28 22:59:31 The middle of my back is sunburned bc I couldn’t reach it when I was putting on tanning oil smhhh
415 2018-08-28 22:59:14 My psoriasis has been out of control lately, especially on my scalp, and I picked up this new tea tree oil shampoo today and I really think this is the cleanest my head has been in about two weeks and I’m just really excited about it.
416 2018-08-28 22:59:12 Due to the grind, I got two ships into the 70s. So, I could just autorun with those two for 20 oil.
417 2018-08-28 22:59:06 "Yeah...there not only was a lot of oil to clean up afterwards. Not to mention it takes up a lot of time and electricity. My appologies for the small blackout earlyer by the way...i was trying to reconnect my circuits and everything decided to give out on me."
418 2018-08-28 22:58:58 It's so sad that some  Cameroonian don't even  know how wealthy that country is. That's why Biya and his cronies can easily pocket the money. Where has oil revenue been going to since 1973? Late Jean Asomo -  once said oil revenue is to complicated for Cameroonian to understand
419 2018-08-28 22:58:43 So the oil rich nation will now be importing gas & selling it at an international price? I guess everything's going up again, including Doubles. Wonder if #Trinis remember 'Caroni'. #Trinidad #Venezuela #Oil #Gas #Inflation

424 2018-08-28 22:58:17 I want to know how you get oil from a snake. Cold-pressed? Expeller-pressed? Stick the snake in a blender?

428 2018-08-28 22:57:23 I saw, I was more comparing CBD to a supplement or essential oil, which have no regulations; therefore the regulation is ridiculous.

432 2018-08-28 22:56:42 Restructuring and PIB were part of APC's manifesto in 2014/15 -  pre-presidential election. By their pre elections posture was that of coming to "right" the "wrongs". Many innocent Nigerians fell for their antics and supported them. Alas this is what we get. It's a pity.

451 2018-08-28 22:54:56 Me, too. Farmers have been shafted by every government except maybe the UFA in the 1930s. Govts should be directing investment to CC adaptation in rural AB in lieu of subsidizing oil companies to dig up more bitumen.
452 2018-08-28 22:54:48 What is truly outrageous is the sanctions imposed on anyone who buys Alberta oil. Bank accounts are frozen and travel visas refused.
453 2018-08-28 22:54:46 Yeah I remember his sucking up for Secretary of State before Pompeo got it; What was that other guy’s name —some oil dude?

456 2018-08-28 22:54:09 Economical with the truth Fraser. Venezuela encountered deliberate USA/Saudi flooding of market with cheap oil to wreck Venezuela economy which was heavily reliant on that oil. The USA cannot countenance anything other than complete submission to their system.

459 2018-08-28 22:53:36 My experience of ultra low mileage old  cars is that they are nothing but trouble- I’d rather pay 80k less and get a high mileage car that operates without constant oil leaks and tedious issues

461 2018-08-28 22:53:23 The bevel alone worked well for me but it worked best when I used the entire system (primer, shaving cream, oil). My only problem was I felt like I smelled like a man. Should be fine for you though lol.

465 2018-08-28 22:52:52 Africa. The entire continent of Africa, 55 countries, put together, that's all of the diamonds of Botswana, all of the gold of South Africa, all of the oil they can export in a year from Angola...All of that put together.... Half the GDP of France!
466 2018-08-28 22:52:41 The woman with an oil tanker named after her. How fitting.
467 2018-08-28 22:52:34 What does a girl have to do to be one of those people that cleans penguins and ducks after an oil spill with dawn soap?!?????? Ugh.
468 2018-08-28 22:52:33 I want a big grilled turkey, roast beef, Swiss cheese, onions, oil and vinegar, a lil salt and pepper, and just a tab bit of lettuce sandwich ohhhhh yeah and mayo! 
469 2018-08-28 22:52:23 To recap special session so far: BOTH chambers have now passed an infrastructure funding bill and a bill to create a state lottery. Now, they'll debate how to divvy up $700 million in BP oil spill damage payments.

528 2018-08-28 22:42:53 That'd be the dream for sure. A lot of things would probably have to line up for it to happen, but not impossible in my opinion. Motivated owner, league interest, team willing to move here, city buy-in, etc. Oil rebounding would help too. Having a rink might help.

The US can't compete with China on emmisions so until China steps up we can't make a sig difference. Bill Nye is right.  We must end people.

561 2018-08-28 22:37:10 I like to get a hot pan, some butter and oil and unions. Cook them until you #DissolveTheUnion then add mince, some garlic and tomato puree and there you have it #Leaskana

568 2018-08-28 22:36:24 me at Disneyland for the last 5 months. When I wear my grey hat i have to wet the whole thing to hide the sweat. Light color hats get oil stains from face sweat, black hats get salt marks from sweat. Im disgusting
569 2018-08-28 22:36:09 I need an oil change, a car wash, & a new tire. Who got me??
570 2018-08-28 22:35:55 I think they have their own essential oil diffusers 
571 2018-08-28 22:35:55 what foolish leader reign in Iraq and KRG as the region could attract people from far and wide to visit such beautiful creations!  Tourism could bring as much as oil - without corruption - and give work to the poorest of citizens

574 2018-08-28 22:35:04 $69 million is a drop in the bucket compared to the billions wasted on subsidies for the coal, oil, gas, and nuclear industry.  Also, $69 Million equals to about 40 Missiles that Trump launched at a Syria air base that was operational within 48 hours after the attack occurred.
575 2018-08-28 22:34:49 for me art should be combined with a pleasurable idea. not pouring oil into a fire. big #fail of curators >:(

579 2018-08-28 22:34:22 Venezuela is suffering from a deep economic depression and hyperinflation. President Maduro devalued their currency by 95% & issued a new currency pegged to the petro, a unit of account backed by oil reserves. It started falling in value soon after its introduction- The Economist

581 2018-08-28 22:34:07 It will be important for @NGRSenate to state the areas that President Buhari has issues with if the PIGB has been rejected. 

As long as we create exclusive rules for the oil industry, we aren't progressing to the country of our dreams.
582 2018-08-28 22:33:30 Yes, but the UK is bigger, so if there is (for example) a downturn in the price of oil, it is a relatively small part of the UK budget, but a massive black hole in an Independent Scotland's
You're welcome
583 2018-08-28 22:33:24 Trump is a disgusting snake oil salesman.
584 2018-08-28 22:33:24 If any of my people from Dallas wants to send me some weed or them oil cartridges I will really appreciate that for this weekend 
585 2018-08-28 22:32:51 Compared to a tablespoon of olive oil, a tablespoon of coconut oil contains about six times the amount of saturated fat, nearly meeting the daily limit of about 13 grams that the American Heart Association recommends.
586 2018-08-28 22:32:50 Exactly the same thing that happened when Venezuela nationalized their oil industry.  It's as predictable as the sunrise.
587 2018-08-28 22:32:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

591 2018-08-28 22:32:08 I imagine VTNZ won't fix the leak unless it's something as simple as the filter or plug not being screwed in properly. Mechanics also do oil services (which is just replacing the oil with and putting a new filter in)

600 2018-08-28 22:30:12 Don't see that at all. No one has said he had a bad day, he's a monster, inhuman. People are trying to understand something that is so incomprehensible. How does 1 go from seemingly having the perfect family to killing them all & putting those poor girls in an oil tank?
601 2018-08-28 22:29:43 I really should have kept an eye on my oil. Never realized how fast it can burn out.
602 2018-08-28 22:29:42 I do daily. Peppermint oil, lavender oil and a few others.
603 2018-08-28 22:29:16 At which time the earth's most powerful will have a serious battle over who controls oil. We have reached an age of exponential demand coming now from China, India, Europe, and the United states. Supplies are being diminished rapidly.  Intelligent people see the trouble coming.

606 2018-08-28 22:29:03 but this is what happens when your immune system is so down and fighting infections or mold/oil in your body, your body doesn't have the capacity to catch up and filter it all out correctly, especially if you have a sluggish liver like me.
607 2018-08-28 22:28:49 Fastest oil change ever
608 2018-08-28 22:28:40 And the oil companies are well aware of this along with many other people, EXCEPT the users, which are only there to gain profits.

616 2018-08-28 22:27:16 #climatechange denial is a sadly classical action by coal and oil industries to privatize short-term profit while socializing impacts and costs.
Prior historic industrial example was cigarettes and smoking.

Diagnosing and repairing cooling systems, doing oil changes,etc. learning a new trade out of pure necessity because I refuse to pay a mechanic $200 an hour just for something simple.
627 2018-08-28 22:24:35 Also just this fact should move investments away from fossil fuels "[...] found that fossil fuel companies risked wasting more than $2tn over the coming decade by pursuing coal, oil and gas projects that could be worthless"

637 2018-08-28 22:23:49 Exactly! At 11 one of my chores was to change the oil in the family car. Brakes and tune ups at 13. My dad wanted me to not have to depend on others, or break down and possibly be taken advantage of by a man. It's funny, I helped a car full of older black guys that were broken...

691 2018-08-28 22:14:48 Your explanation of the cause of the Venezuela crisis was appallingly wrong. The drop in oil price was not the problem.
692 2018-08-28 22:14:39 And yet Bernie, Dimms in general want to expand fed gov? It fails, or in this case, unfairly blamed yet if we only send more money and make it bigger it will get better. This idiocy boggles rational minds.
693 2018-08-28 22:14:36 Sounds good, but to put blind trust in the hands of politicians is tantamount to insanity. Look at Venezuela. I’m sure the people thought they were getting a great system. And, living in an oil rich nation they should. Standing in line for hours to buy bread?

699 2018-08-28 22:13:07 I change my own oil in my Toyota but in my Volks Wagon it take the same oil as BMW so its hella expensive
700 2018-08-28 22:12:38 The good thing is, batik doesn't take too long to dry so it is not an asshole like a huge oil painting which may take weeks to stop smearing...
701 2018-08-28 22:12:37 dude yes ! i went to get my oil changed months back, and they told me i needed other things done and it came out to 1k+. i was like wtf i can’t afford this.  i just came for an oil change.

705 2018-08-28 22:12:09 I think the thing preventing you from properly enjoying the best type of pasta, spaghetti, is using too much sauce! I toss my spaghetti with a couple dollops of olive oil with spices in a sauté pan — perfection.
706 2018-08-28 22:12:05 I don't understand why anyone would say vote against big oil when it's big oil that does so much for this state. They put millions back into the AK economy with jobs & supporting so many non-profit.  How about VOTING NO ON 1 because it's the right thing for AK @standforalaska.
707 2018-08-28 22:12:03 Yuck. Could mean the engine is burning oil too. Be careful 
708 2018-08-28 22:11:58 Yo what exactly is Canola oil..? I always use olive, coconut, or sunflower oil to cook
709 2018-08-28 22:11:49 While I was distracted, @PhilBryantMS widened the special session call to include dividing $700M in BP oil spill money, as well as spending $50M set aside in special session's earlier use-tax diversion bills. There could be $100M in special or "pork" projects in play. #msleg
710 2018-08-28 22:11:36 We ignore the warnings at our own peril. And Trump has added gasoline to a coal fire---litrerally. By law. Oceans at breaking point...and Trump adds oil to the water. Plus open season on whales!
RESIGN.
PLEASE.
711 2018-08-28 22:11:26 watching this guy eat in HK and he asked for hot oil and was surprised bc it was /actually/ spicy lmaoooo 'usually they don't rlly eat that much spicy in this area so this is nice' no need to call us out like this
712 2018-08-28 22:11:22 He’s thinking of vegetable oil. EVOO is so good for you.
713 2018-08-28 22:11:19 Always feel as though you’re burning the midnight oil? Get yourself an academic planner and spend a few hours planning for the month ahead.
714 2018-08-28 22:11:12 You’ll perhaps remember we were in crisis at the time; OPEC was holding the western powers hostage to the flow of oil. It was hardly Carters fault.
715 2018-08-28 22:10:56 I think I'm leaking! Ahhhh, I'm leaking! There's oil everywhere!
716 2018-08-28 22:10:54 Akwete River is part of Abia state..... deris an oil company there .
717 2018-08-28 22:10:53 You and I might agree that Walmart should be their own supply chain,  but we need to understand the financial impact on entire communities much like oil and gas in Alberta. Nobody seems to give a shit about actual farmers and downstream industries that depend on them.
718 2018-08-28 22:10:38 Bros you be the highest abeg... Ur oil no go ever dry
719 2018-08-28 22:10:37 Wtf you should really shop around next time cuz 229$ is wayyyyyy too much for an oil change
720 2018-08-28 22:10:37 also lmao, yeah
on the run from usada and the ghost of melvin purvis, jonny bones covers his path in both oil and thick production cables. he scores yet another illegitimate win over AKA by injuring khabib

726 2018-08-28 22:09:56 Had to pin this to my Small Business & Entrepreneurship on @Pinterest: Haitian artists make these fantastic masterpieces from empty oil drums. These upcycled art pieces are produced by reusing objects that many people see junk and transform them into fantastic wall oranament…
727 2018-08-28 22:09:55 They won't think Trump is the meanie when we lose jobs income and oil because of our governments incompetence.
728 2018-08-28 22:09:52 Looks like someone's hastily sewn together a pair of sweatpants from the beginning of the last century with makeshift boots made for wading through the oil spill infested beaches of the American east coast.

738 2018-08-28 22:07:58 Your husband was more concerned in getting his load blown rather than concern for killing innocent people for oil. USA should be ashamed under bush Clinton and otrama .  Disgusting war mongers to self  enrich at the costs of people's lives and countries. There is hope with DT .
739 2018-08-28 22:07:53 Tariffs in the way & I don't think  they want 2 invest in re tooling car factories. They wld have shares in oil as well I imagine. They're pretending taxpayers money is theirs 2 waste.

751 2018-08-28 22:06:05 The US economy has grown yes, however it is not all down to Trump, a lot of the things he took credit it for to start with were the result of the Obama administration. Other elements helped as well such as oil prices increasing. But yes, it’s grown under trump.
752 2018-08-28 22:05:56 Are you drilling for oil?
753 2018-08-28 22:05:52 Back in Berlin and my coconut oil is still liquid at room temperature this summer still isn’t over xxx
754 2018-08-28 22:05:34 Playing Devils Advocate now. Is coconut oil not an illegal pesticide then? Not registered for use as such and neither is Neem Oil, they have not been tested for that use so no-one knows what problems they might cause to the environment.
755 2018-08-28 22:05:24 1. I burn super unleaded, don’t care about price of regular. 2.  I’ve said Texas several times,  which is also posted on the tweet.  3. My original post was about the difference between price of oil vs gas.  I used the same type of gas back then as I do now.

Cold shower tomorrow.
758 2018-08-28 22:05:09 C'mon on guys, it's so simple maybe you need a refresher course. It's all ball bearings nowadays. Now you prepare that Fetzer valve with some 3-in-1 oil and some gauze pads, and I'm gonna need 'bout ten quarts of anti-freeze, preferably Prestone. No, no make that Quaker State.
759 2018-08-28 22:05:07 I agree. We should have listened to him about renewables. He installed solar panels on the White House and was ridiculed by big oil billionaires like the Kochs.

765 2018-08-28 22:03:57 As the price dropped cities and states added taxes that were masked by the dropping gas prices. Also the connection between oil and gas prices has diverged as refineries have closed and regulations hamper new refineries being built.

802 2018-08-28 21:58:35 Of course, we learned since when pdpigs failed election they've used terrorist groups like Niger/delta avengers to destruct pipelines of oils in Nigeria, as a result of that we could lean forward to think of what we had done b4 introduced oil.
803 2018-08-28 21:58:21 and personally it wouldn't surprise me if there are basically floating colonies out in some of the oceans with the oil rigs and the people with money who know where to hide in international waters

There's probably an entire civilization out there

808 2018-08-28 21:57:27 Went to get an oil change and then they wanted to charge me $140 to change two filters... nah fam! I replaced it myself in less than 5 minutes and it was only $18... FOH! Lol

811 2018-08-28 21:57:10 Tips On Cooking Plants  

Homemade hashbrowns without burning them to the bottom of the skillet?

Start with a bowl, splash of oil then toss the diced potatoes  with the spices you want. Oil the bottom of the pan then cook COVERED. I love this method for breakfast potatoes.
812 2018-08-28 21:56:59 Me in a Tesla is a good enough flex for me lmao ain’t trying to impress these whores no way. My shit don’t need oil changes ever that’s a good enough flex 
813 2018-08-28 21:56:58 At the same time that sperm whale numbers were dwindling, some government tax subsidies (in a round about way) benefitted kerosene. And so, the petroleum-based oil replaced whale oil, allowing populations to stage a comeback.

820 2018-08-28 21:56:31 Lol we are claiming trump is victimizing us when we did same shit to Ghana our neighboring country because we just discovered oil and thought about ourselves only.
821 2018-08-28 21:56:14 with all the newish oil from fracking, the appeal of forward-thinking subsidies loses to the brute fact of market forces
822 2018-08-28 21:55:51 Shall I shield you from the oil?
823 2018-08-28 21:55:47 That's part of it, although they've allowed to keep much of their population without opportunity (and giving them subsidies) while importing labor from South Asia / Philippines to do the necessary work. It's a bizarre set up

UAE & Qatar have to a large extent gone beyond oil too
824 2018-08-28 21:55:22 But I see the British going apeshit if Brexit is stopped.  And these two economies control the world.  The Deep State Worldwide Cabal will loose if either country goes off.  Even oil is good for like 20 years before we reach 50% extraction, then costs will skyrocket.
825 2018-08-28 21:55:11 So I’m getting my oil changed, and I’m sitting in my car while he’s doing it. Toward the end, he brings over my oil dip stick and asks me a question, while showing it to me. I nod and smile and he walks away. #masc

830 2018-08-28 21:54:47 The issue on this topic is that the choice is not the pipeline or nothing. It is the pipeline or Liberian-flagged Saudi tankers and oil-by-rail. It is Canadian-flagged tankers with pilots and escort tugs versus foreign-flagged tankers without pilots or tugs. 2/

835 2018-08-28 21:54:11 But you still here sis  you tried to make your point, & yet I’m still gonna continue to use my coconut oil on my face everyday lol
836 2018-08-28 21:54:08 No!
837 2018-08-28 21:53:52 I kept looking for my roll-on peppermint oil but the gods were against me; I couldn’t find it 
838 2018-08-28 21:53:51 I CNT comprehend what's going on sir 
839 2018-08-28 21:53:42 Wow, that's a beautiful shot! That would make a terrific oil painting.
840 2018-08-28 21:53:40 no oil painting

841 2018-08-28 21:53:30 Here are alternatives....Noodles with margarine....only a little....or use that spray oil ....a low salt stock cube...veg please...lean meat only, white meat preferable....

Let’s get some dairy in, low-fat please 

.....etc 
842 2018-08-28 21:53:25 I’m getting my oil changed right now and the only other people in the waiting room are a cute elderly couple. We were all silent and out of no where the husband goes “Honey, I want to buy a crossbow.”
843 2018-08-28 21:53:21 my worthless dream, went extinct when society decided to fuck me over, i was here to help, my father pushed me when i was 3, the back of my head broke the fall on a sharp pointed rock, all a sudden everything is My fault
your oil is dry, my fault
prayers arent answered, my fault?
844 2018-08-28 21:53:20 Gave my homegirl money for an oil change. Now that’s a grown up bday present
845 2018-08-28 21:53:04 this tea treee oil got my face lookin inmaculate.
846 2018-08-28 21:52:58 sounds like someone could use some oil of oregano
847 2018-08-28 21:52:55 My car has made an awful noise for a month and it stopped when I got my oil changed. That and more on this week’s episode of “William Needs Supervision at all Times!”
848 2018-08-28 21:52:54 Hahahah why not?
849 2018-08-28 21:52:36 I want to practice my oil painting tonight and would love a face for practice! If you guys have any portrait photos that you’d love to share I’d looove that 
850 2018-08-28 21:52:35 Thank you very much. Designed in the city I live in, so it’s got a special place in my heart.
851 2018-08-28 21:52:22 Your living in dreamland.
You can mix water with oil.
Get your facts right Mr. Maduro
852 2018-08-28 21:52:07 Other part of the answer is that we could never rely on national resources alone. We had to travel and trade to survive (back to vikings). Keeping the shipping sector is important for the nation. Oil companies have been forced to buy locally, making room for oil supply industry.
853 2018-08-28 21:51:50 LOL - I’m too soft clearly! I remember watching a show featuring a WW1 pilot saying they had to smear whale oil on their faces to avoid frostbite. Apparently it stank but if you got frostbite it was a court martial offence!

859 2018-08-28 21:51:07 1/ Are you misinformed or just that naive? It’s ALL about the pipelines Donnie. Or lack of ....Are you aware that we are not getting WTI prices????  Why is that, you might ask... Because our oil is stranded, due to the lack of pipelines. Energy East, Northern Gateway, TM

863 2018-08-28 21:50:38 I know in libspeak it can mean whatever you want it to. Myanmar is just " shunning" Rohingya.
864 2018-08-28 21:50:37 This Liberal government can’t blame oil for lost revenue! They don’t even want oil revenue! Try again!
865 2018-08-28 21:50:35 I have many many questions after reading Petrotrin's press release, as I'm sure many of us do. For an economy built on oil and gas, most of us don't have a clue how that sector works.
866 2018-08-28 21:50:32 Lol no Yoruba Demon allowed ,
867 2018-08-28 21:50:31 So here is the question I'd like you to answer. How much better is the clean-up of oil from US tankers on the American side of the border and oil-by-rail along rivers. Your argument founders as you fail to consider the alternatives 1/
868 2018-08-28 21:50:24 I have 12% oil in my car and can’t find anyone who knows how to change it without paying an arm & a leg so i guess I’ll just run my car until it blows up

880 2018-08-28 21:48:43 If you woke up, drove to an independent bookstore, and called the first bookseller you saw a ‘liberal shyster’ who is ruining the country: hello, that was me you spoke with and I hope my shystering made you late for your hourly snake oil enema, you incontinent old goof.

884 2018-08-28 21:48:34 It’s amazing how the opinions are flexible when it comes to Big Oil.
885 2018-08-28 21:48:21 I grew up in NYC and have always known Trump is a snake oil salesman, but understand why non-NYer’s wanted to give him a chance. Trump is the result of decades of corruption creep in D.C., not just the cause. I wish I had been wrong. Love to you and yours from my family.
886 2018-08-28 21:48:07 So it seems we have to get our oil production up to fulfill the need for rubber maids.....pun intended
887 2018-08-28 21:47:57 Shure they can, but the conservatism are leaving the "big oil" actors behind and other actors are taking their place. A new set of entrepreneur culture is needed. OTEC is an overseen huge potential RE source eg from Namibia to Nigeria can supply EU! Do it!
888 2018-08-28 21:47:55 Not complicated, 1 word: Halliburton-oil fields protected, museums containing irreplaceable treasures from the birth of civilization left to be looted-a sad metaphor for US geopolitical military industrial empire protecting oil interests at incalculable  cost

895 2018-08-28 21:46:59 Then 2 tbs in each wrapper. I buy premade wonton wrappers. Theyre in basically any grocery store. Make sure they vegan. I spray the wontons with oil then place on a pan. Cook according to direction! I did 300 degrees for 15 mins, flipping mid way through.

897 2018-08-28 21:46:53 Global collapse in oil? Why is U.S. now the #1 producer? Excuses for mismanagement are just that. The Prov with all the Oil can’t get it out.
898 2018-08-28 21:46:38 Inhofe is a fool, too old to do anything except what big oil tells him to, a traitor to the people of OK & a total asshole. I’m endlessly stunned by the idiots who have kept him in the Senate all these years.

901 2018-08-28 21:46:09 Route 104: Detour via William R Allen Rd, Finch Ave W and Wilson Heights Blvd due to an oil spill blocking the roadway.
902 2018-08-28 21:45:53 Yes oil. But part of the answer is in other energy, particularly hydro. When our oil age started, we'd already based our industry on hydro. Still, 97 % of our electricity concumption is hydro. Oil is and was earmarked for export. We tax petrol over 100 %, and ban oil for heating

913 2018-08-28 21:44:39 And protesting against public officials is not "assembling a mob" -- it is exercising the right to peaceably assemble, and the right to speak.
914 2018-08-28 21:44:29 Is that the oil that is in international. Waters and most of it is closer to Norway. And was discovered and  drilled by multinational. Company’s and there money .  Good luck to Scotland on what you choose     Changing the flag is the easiest thing to sort
915 2018-08-28 21:44:11 China will get tired of Venezuela situation soon as they don't see the same return of their investments here. And as oil exports dwindle to China then endgame soon.
916 2018-08-28 21:44:11 No this is not obvious. Due to oil the UK colonized Iraq, Mussadegh ws killed, the shah installed, the gulf wars fought, the saudis supported. But the Zionist cause has obviously to do with the history of the jewish people which (as others) originated from Palestine.
917 2018-08-28 21:43:54 You should try paying a hundred or so pounds to have some dudes spray your yard with some rosemary oil bullshit that reduces the mosquito population on your property by up to .001%

922 2018-08-28 21:43:07 I think the point is that the SWF helped prevent the advantage of oil turning into a disadvantage for the domestic manufacturing sector (Dutch disease) by limiting currency appreciation @Ramanan_V
923 2018-08-28 21:43:03 Valvoline -$30 for 5 quarts
Mobil 1 - $40 for 5 quarts
Royal Purple -$60 for 3 quarts.

I dont fucking understand the price of engine oil.

925 2018-08-28 21:42:39 Brouzdám po US automobilový aukci a frajer tam vo autě, který prodává píše: "It has been said the only Alfa that doesn’t leak is out of oil."
926 2018-08-28 21:42:31 not to be too heteronormative...but every thing I perform an errand I hate I give solace to myself by thinking “well when I have a husband, he’ll get my oil changed, go to Kroger, talk to the people for me”
927 2018-08-28 21:42:20 @unasur I agree with #Colombia that #Venezuela should free its political prisoners and work with countries like #Uruguay to deliver Oil and grow there economy. Reunifying their government structure through peace.
928 2018-08-28 21:42:11 Made a giant batch of (oil free) sofrito to add to a homemade turkey chili! So much more flavor than without! Added a lot of extra onion and jalapeños!
929 2018-08-28 21:42:03 Support sustainable energies, for no better reason than to withdraw the global power enjoyed by this cruel, immoral regime. Let them drink their oil.
930 2018-08-28 21:42:00 apparently they're melting him with whale oil now ?!
931 2018-08-28 21:41:57 They’re the Syrians of South America, rich in oil and can’t survive in their homeland. That’s the real question..where is the oil and who benefits from this?
932 2018-08-28 21:41:41 No wonder,our surgeon in the making, may God see you through.
933 2018-08-28 21:41:41 Actually the Obama govt. did quite a bit for people losing their homes, to stimulate the economy, improve sustainable energy infrastructure and stabilize financial markets. And if we stopped buying oil from SA tomorrow, the dollar would be fine. What are you actually advocating?
934 2018-08-28 21:41:37 cook oil, i decoded

936 2018-08-28 21:41:11 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
937 2018-08-28 21:41:11 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
938 2018-08-28 21:41:09 Little olive oil and garlic salt

950 2018-08-28 21:39:14 apart from being import dependent i think the fall in oil prices was one of the reasons Trinidad experienced the recession in 2008. So what you basically saying is an increase in the oil prices does nothing for Trinidad's economy? or it's negligible?
951 2018-08-28 21:39:04 I got cussed at because I called this SGRho that had hella baby oil on “RHOtisserie”..... I thought it was a good one.

957 2018-08-28 21:38:31 No, didn't you read it? It says they will come down!
958 2018-08-28 21:38:29 Meanwhile is oil rich dubai the locals are driving gold cars and fly million pound planes.
959 2018-08-28 21:38:28 Why are they protesting. All of Canada needs these pipelines. If you find a replacement for oil then start using it. Until then, its what we have.
960 2018-08-28 21:38:00 It’s a dog whistle for the $TSLA fans to harass critics and short sellers.  Same as the “big oil” conspiracy that we all supposedly work for. $TSLA
961 2018-08-28 21:37:25 OK Donald do something about it like Teddy did at the start of last century with the big oil, steel and railways barons........
962 2018-08-28 21:37:20 Bottle of olive oil character is eternal.
963 2018-08-28 21:37:01 Dude, when you run out of oil you're going to let it happen.  It's absolutely certain.  California too.  Even Hawaii.  Anywhere there might be oil.  At least the oil companies offer us a price we can pay.  Unlike hospitals, drugs, and doctors.
964 2018-08-28 21:37:00 It's called a "sunset industry" for a reason. Investors are divesting from oil, not running to it. They are running to alternative energies for a reason - the 2nd dino age is over.
965 2018-08-28 21:36:33 On my second month of drinking 2 gallons of water a day , no sodas, no sweets , no cow milk, no pork & my skinnnnn is really WOW. I feel like I’m in 6th grade again  S/O to that rosehip oil too
966 2018-08-28 21:36:23 Never done an oil painting before :P
But the skull cloud would definitely be fun to do a picture of!
967 2018-08-28 21:36:19 A clarifying facial mask, vivid green, with lemongrass, jojoba oil, and exfoliating ruby dust. It comes as a sticky powder.
968 2018-08-28 21:36:18 Y’all: peel whole carrots. Brush with oil du jour. salt, pepper, garlic powder, marjoram. Bake at 375 for 50min. 

Ohhhh man. Oh man. 
969 2018-08-28 21:36:01 it's insane. Loopholes upon variances upon exclusions. Oil and gas does whatever they want in CO, with barely any oversight.
970 2018-08-28 21:35:51 This plus his coconut oil deal...I think this was the plan all along 
971 2018-08-28 21:35:45 اعتذر لحضرتك اكيد فهمت خطأ
972 2018-08-28 21:35:04 Yes, the oil was just way too hot.
973 2018-08-28 21:34:52 In that case shouldn’t it be milk made from Palm(er) oil? I’ll get me coat...
974 2018-08-28 21:34:52 Whatever mission the oil companies are on, we are on the opposing side.

If stopping someone from destroying the planet is a "religion", then I am one of the Apostles.
975 2018-08-28 21:34:48 "hey simone you gonna be awake at 8am, the oil gets delivered for our heating"

976 2018-08-28 21:34:39 The oil was suggested to me but in all honesty I don’t like the idea.  There isn’t sufficient evidence of the effects and dosage I’ll stick with my tried and true pain meds and antiemetic.  I work and drive and I don’t want to either under the influence.
977 2018-08-28 21:34:33 “Aramco IPO is an impossible plan.

982 2018-08-28 21:34:04 What a load of bullshit.
1. The choice is not Saddam or ISIS - as if nothing else exists.
2. By numbers killed, Saddam is FAR worse than ISIS.
3. "War for oil." Please spare me your Marxist conspiracy theories.
983 2018-08-28 21:34:00 The US should have imported the Oil from Mexico and Mexico built the wall. But my main concern is the Puerto Rico debt is going to pass 120 billion and we don't have a jobs loan bill stimulant all we have is austerity.  We also need the jones act removed
984 2018-08-28 21:33:57 Actually, the video shown of Jason Kenny speaking in Halifax at a pro pipeline rally had a number of very young people protesting his speech.  They looked about 19 - 20 years old.  Why do they know of the oil and gas industry in Canada?   Who paid them to protest?
985 2018-08-28 21:33:56 Take your loupe and look at all the mint marks when you get a chance. Try not to touch the uncirculated ones because the oil from your fingers will make them change color or leave prints.

995 2018-08-28 21:32:53 I don't think it is at all equatible. The Russia of 60 years ago was agrarian. Now it is more capitalist and has oil. Piss Russia off at your own risk. Obama scoffed at Romney for calling them an enemy. You are calling Mitt correct?
996 2018-08-28 21:32:37 How many people know that standard oil supplied fuel to both sides of the war in WWII????   all those lives lost... had the nazi's ran out of fuel ... so many lives saved. war feeds the greedy

If we continue with the status quo of bad , pernicious and visionless leadership we may end up the Venezuelans way. Think very deep!
1002 2018-08-28 21:31:25 Crude oil in Midland fetched -$18.00 to WTI today, biggest discount since 2012. Combination of the Plains All American tank fire and pipeline closure and local refinery maintenance, with Phillips 66 starting work on a plant in Borger, TX.

Put your hair oil/grease (squeeze bottle only with the skinny tip) in the freezer and then apply to your scalp

1047 2018-08-28 21:26:13 Disagree. Stealing signs builds character. I have scars from running through thorny bushes, was almost killed by a large herd of deer on a 280 offramp at 4 AM, and ruined a pair of pants grabbing a sabotaged sign that was covered in some sort of oil. And I'm a better man for it.

1061 2018-08-28 21:24:41 I don't even understand it,I mean,I understand the english,but the implications of what they saying is what I don't get.

1076 2018-08-28 21:22:40 It would have been amazing if the deal went through but perhaps a % of the Aramco to go private would be apt. As the crown Princes idea was great as Saudi oil will not last forever. So a proportion of the Aramco empire to get the crown Princes vision for 2030 up and running.
1077 2018-08-28 21:22:40 No mention of short/long term impacts to sea life, water quality.  Spend all the money you want understanding mixing oil/water, but if you can't clean it up, restore health to coastal life, nothing matters. 7x more tanker traffic is not comforting.

1082 2018-08-28 21:21:42 International laws do not allow such provocative and hatred activities, the world is standing on the throne of the war, the international crisis will work on oil It will use by terrorists the enemy of humanity, for their fascinating purposes.

1116 2018-08-28 21:17:54 Tinture + coco oil = Space Lube...

...to own the libs.
1117 2018-08-28 21:17:46 Fear of Dutch disease in one of the main reasons for the oil fund. If we don't spend the money nationally, but rather buy investments abroad, the oil money won't hurt the other industries.
1118 2018-08-28 21:17:44 Chef Ramses cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some live hornets, along with sushi.

1121 2018-08-28 21:17:15 Oil prices wavered between gains and losses after U.S and Mexico  reached to revamp their trade agreement
1122 2018-08-28 21:17:15 Makes sense. Im not usually one to go sit out somewhere by myself, but I was on my way home from school and hadn't ate and still had to get my oil changed so I didn't have much of a choice. It wasn't terrible, but I still prefer company!
1123 2018-08-28 21:16:42 Boom they discovered oil n everyone turned to criminal n pursue for his/her selfish interest.
1124 2018-08-28 21:16:42 I get sardines in spring water in my local supermarket. 1.49 a can. Might be a Canadian thing? Cause i can't get them from Costco unless packed in soya oil.
1125 2018-08-28 21:16:40 You'd be betting against everyone in the field who's knowledgable. And, what you're actually trying to predict is the cost of renewables COMPARED to the cost of oil...taking into account the changes in both.  You will lose.
1126 2018-08-28 21:16:29 where do you think we'd be just relying on whale oil and timber?
1127 2018-08-28 21:16:21 And so we will now see the auto sector now go the way of the oil workers and petroleum industry.
1128 2018-08-28 21:16:20 do u still want to smoke without oil if once started with?

1130 2018-08-28 21:15:50 I'm not talking about eating shitty Wonderbread on it's own or something like that. I mean real bread. A good honey oat or even a rye. Or Sourdough. Sourdough bread is the orgasm of the bread world. And Rosemary Olive Oil bread is the cuddles afterwards.

1134 2018-08-28 21:15:29 Chuck Todd!  The REASON Democrats in FLORIDA GIVERNORS RACE are running against trumpy is b/c trumpy wants to drill for oil off the coastline.

1137 2018-08-28 21:15:09 I studied the concept of peak oil almost 20 years ago with Hubbert who was a Shell Oil scientist who correctly predicted US peak oil back in the early 70s. People think shale oil will save us but the EROEI requires it to be at least $60ish a barrel just to break even...

1165 2018-08-28 21:12:33 but no one in power is proposing this - I have to ask why not? surely venezuela could do this as well? must be plenty of demand for their oil
1166 2018-08-28 21:12:17 Also, I know you're a good person and I want us to win. Don't embrace their binary! People fighting the racist oil kleptocracy down here need allies everywhere.
1167 2018-08-28 21:12:17 No, don't mind the headline,what's important is if implemented,wud it curb the corruption in d sector. It's hard2tell cuz it kinda feels like the NA wanna have more control. But I say this without full understanding. Restructuring still seems like the best option to me.

1177 2018-08-28 21:10:37 Poor @LouDobbs. There was a time when I couldn’t wait for his show on @CNN. But now he is feeding into the division of America and the destruction of good conscience as nothing more than a snake oil salesman. It’s a shame when your paycheck is bigger than your heart.

1190 2018-08-28 21:08:57 It is not a matter of “competitive prices”. To Vzla it is most important to increase oil production in Monagas North field through gas lift operations (stategic decision )than to sell the natural gas to Trinidad (short term)

1208 2018-08-28 21:07:12 The moves made by you and your terrorist government joined with our terrorist oposition, are causing serious & lasting damage to Venezuela, But i is not an accidente. Your goal is to take control of our oil fields, gold and all our wealth. But you will fail.

1217 2018-08-28 21:05:51 @CKNW : Canada needs to economically ween itself off the USA and any other countries . Contrary to Globalism we need to refine our own oil, turn our natural resources into  useable merchantable products and sell them to the highest bidder world wide .We will then surpass the US .
1218 2018-08-28 21:05:43 Correct. Very few people know the full name of the building was going to be the IBM-Volkswagen-Coca-Cola-Standard-Oil-Kodak-Bayer Building, but the owner thought it was a mouthful.
1219 2018-08-28 21:05:22 Uh._ is this oil meme going around
1220 2018-08-28 21:05:05 This is ridiculous! How could you possibly say this? McCain voted for every war and increase in military spending. Only 35 COUNTRIES use more oil than the Pentagon! Why is the US in Iraq? Oil. Why is the US in Syria?  Oil! Why does the US want to invade Venezuela? Oil/Socialism!!
1221 2018-08-28 21:04:52 Sigh! When will we begin to build institutions and strengthen our laws to ensure that our resources will be well managed even when a prospective theif finds his/her way into position of power and authority?
1222 2018-08-28 21:04:36 no it isn't the USA has used their power for oil and removed democratically elected people is true. but  to say Liberalism is dead is bullshit. I'm alive, and socialism and liberalism  have the same agenda

1239 2018-08-28 21:02:07 Grazie mille. Color with oil is my favorite painting technique. That feeling is mutual. You guys make this whole experience much richer. 
1240 2018-08-28 21:01:46 So you don't believe in the right of Americans to speak against or refuse to associate with those whose words and deeds they find reprehensible?  I guess you don't have any use for the First Amendment to the US Constitution.
1241 2018-08-28 21:01:32 As for Maduro, the guy is fending off a fascist US and UK supported opposition that actively murders Chavistas because the US wants access to Venezuelan oil and labor.
1242 2018-08-28 21:01:19 I don't normally wash my face in the morning unless I just want to because I'm trying a new skincare item or something, every couple of days I do a honey and peppermint face mask with my Dabur Honey and now foods brand of Peppermint oil then rinse off

1258 2018-08-28 21:00:06 yea, + veganism as a movement can be more environmental. like palm oil is vegan, but it’s impact on the environment makes people who are conscious of it (like vegans) feel like they shouldn’t have it. it’s hard to balance ethics & environment 100% of the time but trying is nice

1262 2018-08-28 20:59:22 Mutti M is playing a dangerous game here. If the US sanction those who help Iran, German business might face ugly consequences. Maybe the Iranian market of luxury automobiles is larger than the American one. And their oil smells like roses.

1268 2018-08-28 20:58:52 We used baby oil first to soften it and then put shaving cream on heir heads for a couple of minutes - then used a soft brush for scrubbing. It was weird but it worked!
1269 2018-08-28 20:58:51 I can’t drink water when I’m drunk I feel like it’s the same as mixing water with oil.. I’m weird like that.
1270 2018-08-28 20:58:49 I’d say spit and baby oil/coconut oil would do the job
1271 2018-08-28 20:58:35 Delicious drenched in olive and coconut oil with sea salt and a pinch of paprika, whack in the oven for crunchy kale chips!

1393 2018-08-28 20:40:22 Imagine our country had a weak military and a David Koresh type took power over Texas oil. Then another country came in and backed him to take over so they could make deals. There would be a whole lot of fundamentalist Christians wreaking havoc on the rest of us.

1399 2018-08-28 20:40:00 Why would you not support electric. It only spells good things for costs, the environment, and fights pollution, maintenance and waste. Which will ultimately make our world a better place.  You are either just incredibly stupid, foolish, or are just a paid bitch for oil.
1400 2018-08-28 20:39:58 4. The carbon levy is good for business.  You don't have to believe it but economists all support it, as well as many of the big players in the oil and gas industry.
1401 2018-08-28 20:39:45 I got my membrane stripped, drunk castor oil twice & guess what? IM STILL PREGNANT! at this point Khloe can’t say shit to me!
1402 2018-08-28 20:39:34 Pretty much everywhere else in the country, it's just pickled vegetables in a jar, usually with vinegar instead of oil.
1403 2018-08-28 20:38:59 Also read how people were tortured for hours on end. Babies boiled in oil, children picked by their hair and shot through the head. Forgive me, but they shove broken beer bottles into vaginas. Burn old people with irons. .....
1404 2018-08-28 20:38:55 Who appropriates oil wells is the bone of contention... I stand to be corrected though!
1405 2018-08-28 20:38:55 You claimed oil is the reason we have Largest economy, after denying in the first place tho. I asked you how much we are exporting now and for how much, you're asking me question. Adam....

1409 2018-08-28 20:38:42 if oil is an option and she still puts better on her bread, leave her. she’s childish.
1410 2018-08-28 20:38:34 It’s not all about oil. There’s whiskey, fishing, wind farms.  It’s about progression. Why can other small nations do it with a lot less resources then? There’s a massive amount of fear mongering with you I see, you’re a bit like that bus saying we’d give 350m more to nhs.
1411 2018-08-28 20:38:20 It appears restructuring is more pronounced in the 5 or 6 oil producing states.
1412 2018-08-28 20:38:17 Today I learned that a lot of depressed people really like spicy food.

Fun fact: spicy food triggers our reward center of our brain. You get a rush of dopamine from the spiciness! 

Now I'm more worried about my hot sauce and chili oil addiction
1413 2018-08-28 20:38:06 3. Yeah, the price of oil hasn't returned to that level yet.  Things are getting busier though and the economy has stabilized.

1416 2018-08-28 20:37:46 Nationalism in it's most basic form enabled us to win two world wars. Without a commonality of purpose and unity within the country this wouldn't have happened.  Americans only rallied when threats were presented as existential to the homeland.

1439 2018-08-28 20:34:59 I’m a big ranch and dressings person, and today I tried my salad with just olive oil, salt, pepper, and lemon. Honestly, it was soooo good and I was shocked that I wasn’t disappointed
1440 2018-08-28 20:34:59 This country should be for everyone not just the rich. I resent my tax money going to defend oil company interests in the Middle East. Maybe they’re the ones that should move or step aside for the people who actually want to make this country better for everyone not just the rich
1441 2018-08-28 20:34:51 This is really disappointing & annoying. This is a President that campaigned to reform our oil sector & make it more efficient. He failed to act, NASS stepped in to pass the PIGB that previous govts had not been able to make and now, he rejects it. Seems someone is lifeless here

1445 2018-08-28 20:34:28 I was curious myself so I took a look. As of 2016, half of Norwegian exports were oil based. Followed at 12% by fish products.
1446 2018-08-28 20:34:22 Key xl was cancelled by obama - not anything harper could do and on top of it all oil took a precipitous decline 2011-2015/16, it was in a strong bear market afterwards it reversed and is in strong bull mrkt. Companies don't invest in downtrends
1447 2018-08-28 20:34:17 The US Coast Guard apparently has no plan if Enbridge’s Line 5 has an oil spill. If the Coast Guard thinks a Line 5 disaster would be too much to plan for, how can our coastal communities hope to cope? Our Great Lakes are too precious to risk in this fashion – Line 5 has to go.

1510 2018-08-28 20:27:33 1) I expect a president that doesn’t support bombing for oil whether we are #1 or not.

3) The reference to bombing he made was not towards Syria, but Syria also has oil so I would not be surprised.

1524 2018-08-28 20:26:22 How many dems voted for that #TaxScam. Also...didnt the @DNC reverse it's decision to ban taking donations form big oil and gas companies? Until dem stop taking money from billionaires and multinational corporations...you have no place to talk about being beholden to donors.
1525 2018-08-28 20:26:21 Getting my oil changed:
Tech: Do you want our complimentary inspection?
Me: No.
Tech: What?
Me: I'm just going to tell you no to any problems you find.
Tech: Okaayyy.

1528 2018-08-28 20:25:43 They paid less cause oil prices low, so many didnt make as much as normal.  Affected other categories of corps, ceos, execs
1529 2018-08-28 20:25:40 I still wonder who got the wisdom to cook beans with red oil. Blessed a whole generation bro.
1530 2018-08-28 20:25:33 But a big hole will be left,so its a big evidence
1531 2018-08-28 20:25:28 True.
But Like Qatar, Norway has a small population.
Only about 5.25 million people live in Norway.
*So oil money & shipping money go a long way.
1532 2018-08-28 20:25:23 For things that you put in your body it would be wise to keep a hard lindy effect rule

1. Olive oil
2. coffee
3. meat
4. veggies

Easy rule. But for other things that are lindy compatible like typing, maybe writing longhand isnt necessary. Just slow down....
1533 2018-08-28 20:25:05 Was happily eating bole and now my acrylic nails are ruined with palm oil. Stress men
1534 2018-08-28 20:25:03 I've literally been pampering myself all day. I covered myself in coconut oil and massaged my body, and after that I layed in the sun and just listened to the breeze and the birds and all the little outside noises that calm my soul.
1535 2018-08-28 20:25:01 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1536 2018-08-28 20:24:59 @Aronja_Art Do you have any more ESO oil paintings? Possible to order one? Loved it so much haha would be great to hang in the background of an ESO stream
1537 2018-08-28 20:24:54 Svoboda shares many similarities with ANTIFA, notably, use of violence, tearing down statues, mainly of Lenin. This fact alone doesnt tie them to fascist antifacsist movement here though. 
Was there a trial I missed? You seem to have convicted him.
1538 2018-08-28 20:24:44 Anyone tried #Hempura CBD oil for #anxiety? And which product (oil/capsules) and strength is best to begin with?

1540 2018-08-28 20:24:19 Somebody wanna take my car to get the oil changed? I'm too lazy
1541 2018-08-28 20:24:13 Hey!  What was all crazy I think the Santa Barbara oil drilling plans
1542 2018-08-28 20:24:08 Yeah, forgot the name of the law but secondary sector matters more than primary sector. But I guess for Norway, it either has had enough oil or has developed policies to concentrate on the secondary sector too.
1543 2018-08-28 20:23:48 Pranam SIR pailagu. I am at garage getting oil change done. It's a hot one here in Toronto #ABEFTEAM #ABEFCANADA #Yourstruly #DiehardABfanToronto
1544 2018-08-28 20:23:40 #PrimeTimeEdition conversation...sweet kisses.. complements.. sensual touch or shower together then body oil and massage u
1545 2018-08-28 20:23:36 So putting tariffs imports of Mexican oil into the US will pay for the wall?
1546 2018-08-28 20:23:33 Omg, Ben suggested getting a tub of lard instead of oil for frying; doesn't mind a path to a heart attack?! #CBB
1547 2018-08-28 20:23:25 Egbami ooo @segalink @stevensonolush3
1548 2018-08-28 20:23:08 I put a bit if oil in a casserole dish.
Sliced 4 rashers of bacon into lardons. Didn't have smoked so used plain. Fry gently. Wash and slice 1 leek and quarter half a dozen mushrooms. Add them to the bacon and fry for a bit. Meanwhile make up 1ltr of chicken stock.
1549 2018-08-28 20:23:05 okay then it's probably page 13 through 17 but I know those are the two numbers that I recorded when I have to put in the bankruptcy law so what she's doing is keeping you all from filing bankruptcy and digging in the ground for oil for Saudi Arabia to have an gasoline account.
1550 2018-08-28 20:23:04 How do you change the oil in your car?
1551 2018-08-28 20:23:01 Nigeria is the only country that have oil and refine oil outside country it is a shame,thanks be to God l am a @Biafran,glory be to God amen
1552 2018-08-28 20:22:51 With @interior’s latest rule on methane waste rule due any day now, we have the materials to keep you informed on everything you need to know about the needless loss of natural gas during oil and gas production on federal lands and the billions of dollars in taxpayer losses.
1553 2018-08-28 20:22:51 This is like if big oil spread propaganda that slandered clean energy and someone was like “this propaganda is false and damaging to our cause” and you were like “I assume you call clean energy out just the same?”
1554 2018-08-28 20:22:49 ขอสักทีเถอะ
1555 2018-08-28 20:22:38 Ahhhh, OK. You can mix with almond oil or you can buy something called dipropylene glycol, which is completely odorless with a high smoke point. Some craft and most chemistry supply sites should have it.
1556 2018-08-28 20:22:34 TEA TREE OIL WORKS MAGIC
1557 2018-08-28 20:22:32 Granted there's certain items I choose to purchase elsewhere....but I literally just bought coconut oil, rubber kitchen tongs, black pepper, bathroom cleaning supplies, solid Tupperware and more with pretty much couch change.
1558 2018-08-28 20:22:11 If you can spot your Pastor in this closed door meeting - you need to find yourself a new church. Water and oil doesn’t mix...light and darkness can not share the same room.  Just saying
1559 2018-08-28 20:22:05 Lmao the chemicals dry your skin out. Gotta oil em up before you snap up
1560 2018-08-28 20:22:03 We just put out a HUGE Essential Oil order!! ;)
1561 2018-08-28 20:21:54 TR Oil Research forecast crude inventories increased by 2.8 million barrels for the week ending August 24th, 2018. Let's see where we land......
1562 2018-08-28 20:21:52 How much does oil extraction cost in Norway compared to North Sea? Do they pay for healthcare? Does their population share the same demographics?
Ridiculous.
If you like Norway, go live there. Off you pop.
1563 2018-08-28 20:21:39 If you want an example how about their crude oil they dont have the infrastructure to move it anywhere else how long do you think they'll last if we decide someone else has a better deal
1564 2018-08-28 20:21:24 Bugs love me they want to take part in a jar full of oil and anxienty.
1565 2018-08-28 20:21:23 @DGodfatherMoody Godfather for your question of the day I would say I would love to see Lucas oil raceway park instead of the Brickyard, or take the trucks to Kern County motors speedway
1566 2018-08-28 20:21:20 Shutting myself off; theres olive oil in my ears, good night 
1567 2018-08-28 20:21:20 Seriously, did HE collapse the economy? Johnson and Nixon (and JFK) had messed up US public finances and a second oil shock hit. HE appointed Volker who ended inflation.
1568 2018-08-28 20:21:16 I still enjoy a Marathon and a pack of Opal Fruits before moisturising with Oil of Ulay. Paid for with a pound note!
1569 2018-08-28 20:21:12 Except for a fish oil ( dha)and a multi vitamin. I just got a gnc womans multi. I just was taking too much and not feeling better and too obsessed about it all. I took 2 steps back. It's nice.
1570 2018-08-28 20:20:59 We normally let her go to bed first, so she is a bit more chilled - then straight back to bed after so the oil has overnight to do its stuff.
1571 2018-08-28 20:20:49 Who doesnt need an oil change out there?...
1572 2018-08-28 20:20:44 Warm salt water soaks once or twice a day and put tea tree oil only before you go to sleep. Will clear up in a few days. :-)
1573 2018-08-28 20:20:42 Aren't there a bunch of poor oil countries though?
1574 2018-08-28 20:20:40 climate hawks don’t net a total of over $3.3 million in contributions from the oil & gas industry.
1575 2018-08-28 20:20:34 Sold over 2millionbpd in 2010-14 @ over $100bp. Sold as low as 900k amd as low as $27. How come it dropped this low yet it is oil that has made us largest economy? Btw you claimed i was lying earlier but now it's always been largest since GEJ?
1576 2018-08-28 20:20:31 This man and power. Be holding on to power even when ..........

1579 2018-08-28 20:20:22 Her tenure intersected with a huge spike in oil prices, raising the dividend significantly and giving her a 90% approval rating in the state. Without it she might not have been nominated VP!

1581 2018-08-28 20:19:40 Are you telling me I shouldn’t have confidence in what the President states? I was in support of bombing Syria for human rights issues. He has mentioned taking action for oil gains, which if you truly believe in a free market would be better placed in the region it’s located.
1582 2018-08-28 20:19:38 No pictures/videos loool
1583 2018-08-28 20:19:15 Bath, but then rinse it separately with shower head, and don’t really use lots of bubble stuff really. Plain water, then shower/bath gel cream etc directly onto brush or mitt or something.
I tend to use Neals Yard or some kind of relaxing oil, so not much in the way of froth.

1587 2018-08-28 20:18:44 This is true Tim although not quite sure how it relates to an olive oil spill in the kitchen 
1588 2018-08-28 20:18:25 Made fatouche again. I learned that the limes oil and seasonings (everything except the cucumber eggplant and tomatoes) make a great meat marinade too
1589 2018-08-28 20:18:24 I wouldn’t know, they cook everything in peanut oil 
1590 2018-08-28 20:18:22 I drink wine, 2 standard drinks at every evening meal, very occasionally more, and my ALT and AST are 15. Sometimes keto but always avoiding seed oils, using ghee, dripping or olive oil, very little sugar.
1591 2018-08-28 20:18:19 I think I'll just get the oil change tomorrow, I think my car will be ok until then.

1594 2018-08-28 20:18:03 Indeed. They were told all about it by a passing snake oil salesman.
1595 2018-08-28 20:18:01 True grater is faster but sometimes I accidentally cut myself with those (also razors). And only good thing B&BW has done is introduce roll-on purse/pocked sized orange ginger aromatherapy oil. They discontinued my orange ginger bath salts & concentrated aromatherapy oil. 
1596 2018-08-28 20:17:52 Lol can u explain this better
1597 2018-08-28 20:17:27 With Trudeau shutting down the pipeline and a bill being passed to put over 250 more regulations on our oil and gas industry, Canada is done in regards to energy. As well, Trudeau has also made Saudi oil exempt from the carbon tax.

Trudeau’s an idiot.

They are insane, totally insane.
1601 2018-08-28 20:17:10 We have used arsenicum & sulphur for mange which works if you the mange isn't too bad plus garlic oil and arnica for various sprains and sores etc. But always on the look out for any other treatments. The marmite sandwich is a good idea.
1602 2018-08-28 20:16:53 U think say geebois they play,God we thank you for not giving up on us,we would have bn led astray to be involved in all these,even with the knowledge.

1608 2018-08-28 20:16:23 Why is Twitter putting ads for oil company spokespeople and car buying services for police cars in my TL? It's like they don't even know me. But now I'm wondering if I could buy a police car.
1609 2018-08-28 20:16:09 so i know how to change my oil but my boyfriend is going to change my oil for me after work bc he wants to and i just think its so cute idk
1610 2018-08-28 20:16:00 Too often our elected officials represent:

 Big Pharma
 Big Telecom
 Big Oil
 Big Banks

Real campaign finance reform means a system where we get back to representing the people who elected us.
1611 2018-08-28 20:15:49 3) Called PEPPER trucks because vegetables were shipped along with the drugs to mask the odor. They also used specially modified Oil carrier trucks were the drugs were inserted inside the outer vessel in a double designed vessel.
1612 2018-08-28 20:15:40 #45 will have to find an excuse to knock Iraq's oil production offline then, as he did with Qatar's LNG.

1615 2018-08-28 20:15:20 Battery environmental issues aside, nuclear is the only viable option for an electric transition. And even then, it would take thousands of large scale reactors to supplant world oil demand.

1617 2018-08-28 20:14:54 I worked with our graphics wizard Mitch Kersey on this new whiteboard video about how aggressive R&D, streamlined permitting for C02 pipelines and public-private partnerships can lead to huge ECONOMIC benefits if we capture and use carbon for enhanced oil recovery.
1618 2018-08-28 20:14:49 'All sides' is a bit like Trump on Charlottesville no? Except you can replace Nazi thugs with our favourite oil supplier and terrorist exporter.
1619 2018-08-28 20:14:48 If we had energy east we could refine more of our own crude which we are currently selling for less than 40 dollars a barrel and the gasoline we do produce is mostly from imports at higher oil cost. Most likely oil producing nations have gasoline at sub $1 so it is doable
1620 2018-08-28 20:14:40 Everyone with money wants a leg in the game just like the oil tycoons, casino owners, sports team owners, etc..
1621 2018-08-28 20:14:37 Buhari and his cronies intend to stay more than eight years. Even at that, they don't get that this oil they are looking at won't be around for more than a decade and half.
1622 2018-08-28 20:14:37 No. Based on their consistent censorship of the right and their monopoly status. Not much different from Standard Oil.
1623 2018-08-28 20:14:36 When you take your car to the KIA dealer to get an oil change and you get tired of the repeating Netflix preview and suddenly your realize the WiFi and Apple TV they use is unsecured. Needles to say I made that tv my bitch!!! 
1624 2018-08-28 20:14:24 and allows aquifers to be contaminated with oil extraction wastewater.
1625 2018-08-28 20:14:10 Thank you!! I’ll seek out the oil! I braid my bangs back every day so I’m just trying to change my look up a bit but it’s impossible lol!
1626 2018-08-28 20:13:59 I am having a sweet and pretty dream that

 chestnut mustang.
1627 2018-08-28 20:13:50 Cause when you speak bullshit reek like oil leak
1628 2018-08-28 20:13:46 Don’t stop with McCain. Keep this idea going. Take a look at Jerry Brown, who leads the chorus of climate change action while his administration has approved tens of thousands of nw oil wells
1629 2018-08-28 20:13:41 So tired of having to post how shitty your products are. I don’t have a lot of money. I spent 400$’s at this place for my prescription. The THC-Indica oil and THC-Pills were just a waste of money. The vap cartridges tastes like you’re smoking plastic. We need to reform the law.

1632 2018-08-28 20:13:14 Popcorns are normally fried in the same pot, in the same oil, at the same time and under the same heat conditions, 
But they do not all pop at the same time..My friends never compete with anyone in your life ,your time will come
1633 2018-08-28 20:13:14 Yet our govt is planning to waste $410m on elections. I'm not even talking about the yearly NASS budget which costs more & the cost of running successive rogue, clueless & insensitive govts. I wish crude oil disappears from this country so that this evil dance can end.

1637 2018-08-28 20:13:08 Electric cars are the future. In 15-20 years oil prices will reach a new high. Most people won’t be able to afford it. Battery cost will come down and efficiency will go up. Making it way cheaper to go electric. I can also see autonomous vehicles as mandatory and inevitable.
1638 2018-08-28 20:12:50 @realDonaldTrump savage behaviour, no respect for disabled people. You must see what they do to our people. Burn them with hot irons and cooking oil. Then kill execussion style. No shame. No respect for life.  They just want everything for free.
1639 2018-08-28 20:12:38 for those of you who are believing the presidency that Donald Trump want Nigerian oil. America actually stopped buying Nigeria oil since December 2014. We have even been begging them to resume the importation of Nigerian oil.
1640 2018-08-28 20:12:19 I’m stuck with #Maury as I wait for an oil change.  All I’m saying is... if you don’t want to be seen as animals or trash, don’t behave like such.  Holy crap, my ears hurt from all the screeching.  Spoiler alert; he *was* the father.
1641 2018-08-28 20:12:18 apparently the chorizo is added at the same time to release the oil for the onion!

1654 2018-08-28 20:11:12 Do y’all know y’all oil percentages for your car off the top of your head?
1655 2018-08-28 20:11:09 this the deal with the tories, pro Empire pro colonialism, anti democratic proponents of racists idealogies  - now they are back in Africa selling snake oil.
1656 2018-08-28 20:10:33 I picked up a couple of oil stocks today, so watch for oil to drop through the floor and drive a few multinationals out of business
1657 2018-08-28 20:10:28 i constantly treat my lips with the necessary scrubs, following it with a drop or two of rose/lavender oil, and top it off with vegan lip balm in the case that i become unconscious and a prince (fine asf duh) has to kiss me to break a witchcraft spell.
1658 2018-08-28 20:10:23 For basic salads I’ll use red onion, chicken, spring mix, and oil and vinegar. Some I’ll add tomatoes avocados green peppers,and red peppers. I’ll season my chicken to what I know will be in my salad.

1660 2018-08-28 20:10:15  ...hope there’s no oil slick from the barrels
1661 2018-08-28 20:10:10 That's easy. Quarter about a dozen and a half while a clove of garlic, diced onions and a half cup of chopped carrots heat up in a pan on the stove with the help of some olive oil. Add a can of tomato paste and the cherry tomatoes and cook till hot. Add to freshly cooked pasta.

1671 2018-08-28 20:09:26 i've not made this myself but my dad does it quite often, i think the dressing is şalgam (turnip juice), pomegranate molasses, sumac, lemon juice, bit of olive oil and lots of parsley
1672 2018-08-28 20:09:23 Thank you! I am using coconut oil and running it under cold water or air!
1673 2018-08-28 20:09:12 Americans Christians think it's perfectly OK to kill anybody who elects somebody who won't pander to the western oil companies.  Why are you complaining about anyone else?  Americans are the biggest killers on the planet.

1691 2018-08-28 20:07:24 Mujaddara: fry sliced onions (maybe 3) in olive oil; 1 1/4 cup washed green lentils; boil in 4 cups water for 15 minutes with pinch salt; then add 3/4 cup white rice with several grinds pepper.  Mix 1/2 of the sauteed onions in when done (15 min.); the rest for topping.

1702 2018-08-28 20:06:16 Thank you, very informative!

Grid seems very clean but oil use still significant. Transport would probably need electrification, so there could be increasing need for electricity. Could that require nuclear growth or best met with RE?

1706 2018-08-28 20:06:05 Yeah, that and all the nonsense about putting oil in the British channel and setting it on fire. I think he came up with the idea to use mustard gas on the beaches as well.
1707 2018-08-28 20:06:05 Bro if I set an appointment to get my oil changed at 4, why am I still waiting an hour to get my car back? What the fuck was the point of making an appointment? Now I’m stuck on Warrensville Center looking stupid

1776 2018-08-28 19:57:33 I mean, in the US don't we constantly see arguments that tie economic growth to deregulation of industries that produce oil/gas/coal? It's the same argument right: we all benefit economically if we perpetuate unsustainable environmental policy.
1777 2018-08-28 19:57:16 Funny the US energy sector seems to be doing pretty well with the same oil prices, except for the deep discount Canada suffers due to no pipeline to tidewater of course.

1781 2018-08-28 19:56:50 I mean we're trailing off into far afield territory. My point is that a SWF could lock into unsustainable policies- regardless of the policymakers- because they are necessary for the SWF to function. E.g., Norway, oil.
1782 2018-08-28 19:56:47 Plus the manufacturing of wind turbines and solar panels require heavy metals & result in extremely toxic waste. Neither wind or solar can store energy. We can store oil, coal & natural gas. Plus, we don’t need to “manufacture” them.

1786 2018-08-28 19:56:32 Planes using corn oil or somesuch, You really think there is the landmass to replace oil with plant matter? come on . Why do you need new vehicles? you can run old diesels on corn oil straight from the bottle.

1790 2018-08-28 19:56:10 Damn, that was quick. Rent free in your head already. Damn, you hate a lot.
Emotion and logic are like oil and water, they don't mix. You're all emotion, no logic.
1791 2018-08-28 19:56:08 I didn't even bother with that. You're perfectly okay to point out the 48% of the food we grow locally is good to go. Fair enough. What that has to do with the over 50% that we do is making me confused. Milk but no cereals, okay. Meat but no sauces or oil for fries or salt/pepper
1792 2018-08-28 19:56:01 Snake oil, well stated Mr Blake
1793 2018-08-28 19:55:59 Okay so lavender essential oil (make sure to mix with coconut oil), I constantly iced mine, and aloe helped me a lot
1794 2018-08-28 19:55:56 You, too, can have this treasure! 

1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 1.5 Tbsp cocoa powder, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp vanilla, 2 Tbsp oil, 2 Tbsp water.
1795 2018-08-28 19:55:39 Canada has oil, sure. 

But the maple syrup reserves are far more valuable.

1804 2018-08-28 19:54:53 Then add palm oil
1805 2018-08-28 19:54:49 Looks like taking oil possibly for cooking.
1806 2018-08-28 19:54:46 Girl I seasoned up some chicken once it was towards the end at some butter to baste it. Juicy as hell. I used mixed greens for better nutrition all the iceberg lettuce and stuff is a way to eat your water. Mixed greens red onion chicken oil vinegar. BOMB
1807 2018-08-28 19:54:31 You can put kale in a frying pan with some olive oil, stir it over the eye of the stove until the oil is spread consistently, then slide the kale into the trash and use the oiled frying pan to make taco meat.

1811 2018-08-28 19:53:56 Even with energy east, we would have to make sure that most oil pumped through is for domestic consumption. I think that such requirements from Trudeau would be viewed as anti-Canadian / too interventionist among many Canadians.
1812 2018-08-28 19:53:48 Made the boyfriend go with me to get my oil changed bc i hate going alone

1814 2018-08-28 19:53:28 This is news? The bottom dropped out on oil, creating less revenue for individuals, capital losses, and layoffs of workers who were making 130k-150k. Geez, who would have thought that.

1819 2018-08-28 19:52:56 I like the smell of fuel but grease doenst smell really and the oil, only the fewest can and will work on their cars. Most just buy one of the new muscle cars and dont care about anything.

1830 2018-08-28 19:51:13 Nicola Sturgeon's SNP bleat about the number of jobs at risk through Brexit. They are silent about the number of jobs which would be lost through Independence. Snake Oil Selling for Scotland.
1831 2018-08-28 19:51:11 It's no socialist experiment at all! Venezuela is oil rich and it's economy is largely based upon this. However, it's restricted largely by US sanctions. Venezuela isn't a socialist country and for the record, its economy has no relevance to the UK's whatsoever.
1832 2018-08-28 19:51:04 the idea that what non-nationalists are saying is that we can't "manage our own affairs" is a carefully crafted myth that nats repeat endlessly because they know we're already a free country and all they're selling is snake oil.
1833 2018-08-28 19:51:03 I understand that what's that got to do with the oil companies gouging are eyeballs out on the gas prices

1838 2018-08-28 19:50:30 Indeed, though that's why it was brought (oil and gas)
1839 2018-08-28 19:50:25 Is the fragrance you have essential oils or fragrance oil?
1840 2018-08-28 19:50:09 Perhaps you could expound on the US sanctions that are strangling the country. A country that, by chance, has the most oil/gas in the world.
1841 2018-08-28 19:50:09 @deandelray listening to the george lynch episode, can you shed any light on who the 80s band was who bought their way onto every big tour with daddy's oil money?
1842 2018-08-28 19:49:57 Sounds like it's time we all go electric or fuel cell. Get off the oil company's teet.
1843 2018-08-28 19:49:52 oil pulling is no joke people.. longest 15 minutes of my LIFE
1844 2018-08-28 19:49:51 Remember that Harper did almost nothing for Ontario. All he cared about was easy money from oil while manufacturing evaporated away. A lot of people lost money and jobs. Energy superpower. Oil was over $120/barrel and royalties were good. Ontario noticed.
1845 2018-08-28 19:49:49 Sea Salt bath and oil burning 
1846 2018-08-28 19:49:48 No exact recipe but dates, peanut butter, honey, mixed nuts, and coconut oil. Chuck it all  in a food processor, press into a container, chill overnight, and then slice into bars. They're like rocket fuel.
1847 2018-08-28 19:49:43 Africa. The entire continent of Africa, 55 countries, put together, that's all of the diamonds of Botswana, all of the gold of South Africa, all of the oil they can export in a year from Angola...All of that put together.... Half the GDP of France!
1848 2018-08-28 19:49:43 The takings measure doesn't just apply to oil and gas /mineral rights. It would actually be much more broad than that wherein lies the rub.

1850 2018-08-28 19:49:31 I used tea tree oil and it worked super well to get rid of the bump. Mine got SUPER infected for some reason and so I had to take it out but there was about a week that I thought I had a totally healed
1851 2018-08-28 19:49:24 Sounds good,  but I find baking gives an even cooking and it uses less oil.

1854 2018-08-28 19:48:34 Me too. I’m on meds for it but I still have a lot of trouble with it. Are you on meds for it?  My sister in law uses the cbd oil and does great but it didn’t work for me.
1855 2018-08-28 19:48:32 We have a 2017 Highlander. It is one yr old and has 20,000 Miles. Not a single problem. Uses zero oil. A great family vehicle. I highly recommend the Highlander.
1856 2018-08-28 19:48:29 True... Miracle Whip has the delicious flavor of water, soybean oil, high-fructose corn syrup, vinegar, and modified corn starch - just like nature intended.
1857 2018-08-28 19:48:23 I can’t believe them to leave from Venezuela... there is rich oil in South America no more ? Where is oil petroleum?
1858 2018-08-28 19:48:15 Largely because western countries backed Islamic opposition forces against regimes that they didn't like and allowed Saudi influence to spread in return for oil is the short answer I think.

1860 2018-08-28 19:48:03 In your opinion. This is the issue. Your opinion, in all due respect means nothing. When you have a NS accredited document, it’s robust and fit for purpose. That’s the end of the story. GERS was great for Nationalists when we had oil revenue, but now we don’t it’s evil.
1861 2018-08-28 19:47:56 I started taking CBD oil 5 months ago for foot and joint pain. Foot pain is gone joint pain is much better. Be careful where you buy. Many are a ripoff. Buy from a certified dispensary
1862 2018-08-28 19:47:48 How much was oil in 2010-14, and now 2015-18? Also how many barrels were sold daily in these years? Let's calculate oil and gas.
1863 2018-08-28 19:47:47 I find frying it is more labour intensive and it can go wrong. When Baking the tofu the heat is more even and its uses less oil. Let me know how you get on

1876 2018-08-28 19:46:31 As a Canadian in hoping they dont.

It would cause my country to potentially work for itself.

We are building a pipeline.. to send oil to china... so they can refine it... and we buy it back.

Instead of refining it ourselfs.

1884 2018-08-28 19:45:38 For all other 2.5 SkyActiv engines, Mazda recommends the use of 0W20 Full Synthetic oil. The 5W30 oil is not anything “special” but is different than what Mazda has been recommending in the past for the 2.5 SkyActiv engine. Sorry for the confusion.
1885 2018-08-28 19:45:20 The 2018 Mazda CX-9 has the 2.5T SkyActiv engine and Full Synthetic engine oil is not recommended because it is turbo charged. Mazda recommends 5W30 non-synthetic oil to be used in the turbo charged version of the 2.5 SkyActiv engine.

1902 2018-08-28 19:43:46 I think there will always be buyers of Iranian oil that will shit on US sanctions.
1903 2018-08-28 19:43:41 all of this is from US blockading Iran's oil shipments not 'Islamist Dictatorship. The US pushed this war and now Iran and China Navy has taken a step against our Regime Change tactics. US caught with their pants down.

1935 2018-08-28 19:39:54 A vote for @BetoORourke  is a vote against a macro agenda that is producing results. More jobs, better trade deals, safer communities , ending theft of intellectual property and addressing international inequities previous presidents have failed to address.
1936 2018-08-28 19:39:51 I do this but with oil
1937 2018-08-28 19:39:44 Then you need an alternative to oil, ps, there isnt one. Where can you find an easily transportable energy source? which makes all the things oil makes? Trees btw are solar batteries and carbon sinks, youve just dissed them, are you sure you believe AGW?.
1938 2018-08-28 19:39:44 OHHHHH where are my basic b's at lol we just released Pumpkin Spice Latte CBD flavored oil.... — feeling excited

You that we know you hail from jenifa's hometown...

Yelz, we oil knows you's from Ayetoro
1942 2018-08-28 19:38:53 oak or maple are probably going to be your two best bets. Both pretty sturdy and resistant to dents and dings while also being p cheap. I might look into finishing the wood with an oil + sealant combo. coconut oil is a good one to use. gives a nice shine and makes it smell great!
1943 2018-08-28 19:38:49 Liar OBAMA Fraud Did 9 COUPS, Made 200.000.000 People Homeless Around The World Living In Tents ,Created ISIS Allowed Them Sale Oil in Open Market @PressSec @Varneyco @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @GovMikeHuckabee @DevinNunes @RepGoodlatte @LevinTV
1944 2018-08-28 19:38:34 Nah bro I’m getting my oil change
1945 2018-08-28 19:38:32 Well that would make the President a Hypocrite lauding a man who mixed with him like Oil n Water, was responsible for the Phony Dossier, being the last vote to not repeal Obamacare, it isn`t shameful it`s honest
1946 2018-08-28 19:38:12 Because those candidates get money from Gas and Oil duh.

The rest of us however need to live here and raise familes here.
We don't need contaminates in our ground causing health issues that will bankrupt us and the potential for earthquakes and damages from that.
Thanks, but no
1947 2018-08-28 19:38:07 In the documentation Line 2 is primarily a heavy oil line and is supposed to mostly carry bitumen. Line 1 is to carry a mix of refined and light crudes.
1948 2018-08-28 19:38:01 Snake oil salesman.  Hiding behind freedom and liberty.
1949 2018-08-28 19:37:56 LMAO! 
Oil and gas he said. How much is oil pb now? How many barrels do we sell daily? Go and find out these facts. how much we sold 2010-2014, then how much 2015-2018. Then we can continue this conversation. In the meantime, start a fire, you'll be burning your cert tonight.
1950 2018-08-28 19:37:51 I politely declined.  Years of Coleman selling snake oil I don’t need to hear about how they’ll fix it this time around.
1951 2018-08-28 19:37:46 under threaded jurisdiction of my own making, at my very well-capacitated guise and authority seconded by concerned tweeps, I, @eberovic authoritatively ended a seemingly viral madness. Y'all should be greatful
1952 2018-08-28 19:37:45 Nope as russia is creating a huge oil pool
1953 2018-08-28 19:37:43 And isn’t that directly tied to their oil industry?
1954 2018-08-28 19:37:35 No surprise since everything seems to cost about 20% to 30% more these days.  It's that huge jump in the cost of oil since @realDonaldTrump took over that's the major culprit.  Those transportation costs mount up.
1955 2018-08-28 19:37:15 It’s all fun and glitter till you get in bed with Soleil Blanc body oil on.
1956 2018-08-28 19:36:16 LRT, went there today to get just olive oil. Left with a full shopping bag and no olive oil.
1957 2018-08-28 19:36:13 No, its the CO2 emissions from burning coal and oil and gas plus methane mostly caused by fossil fuel extraction.
1958 2018-08-28 19:36:06 Alaska has it right with regards to gas companies.  They tax gas companies and pay Alaskans that revenue. 

CA is a big gas/oil state too. We would benefit greatly from the same type of system. We need it. They should pay for our healthcare with all the pollution they create.
1959 2018-08-28 19:36:03 As you get older Greig, you’ll soon realise it’s the best part of the day and your body clock wakes at the early hour of 4am! As someone who burned the midnight oil in night owl status for years, it came as a shock to me too! 
1960 2018-08-28 19:36:01 Wait wait WAIT. Has my tea been entirely vegan?? (artichoke pasta w garlic, chilli, parsley, lemon, nutmeg, olive oil. Wine, obviously) *frantically eats a lump of bacon*
1961 2018-08-28 19:35:40 I’m sure he’ll be back in Wilkos soon to get some motor oil

1981 2018-08-28 19:33:14 @sendavidperdue is an embarrassment to Georgia. He lied on the national news about trump's "s- hole" countries remark only to have trump admit that he said it. He agrees with trump's plan to put oil platforms off the Ga. Coast in spite of the fact that he lives on Sea Island.
1982 2018-08-28 19:33:14 The discussion should be what is ideal not required. To thrive not survive. You can survive off boxed vegan foods full of veggie oil. Thriving is eating organ meats. Wild animals know this and go for the organs first.

1985 2018-08-28 19:32:48 More cash for Buhari & his con men to share 'cos all the returned so far hasn't imparted on our economy. Bottled groundnut was N300 now N600, Palm oil N150 now N300, petrol N97 now N145, Rice N7500 now N15000, dollar N180 now N370. What! Is it by force to be president? #resign

1989 2018-08-28 19:32:10 He lost the primaries two years ago. These people need to accept reality: Bernie was a flawed candidate and had minimal chance of winning a primary. He went from regional grifter snake oil salesman to nationwide. He serves no purpose right now except to divide the party.
1990 2018-08-28 19:32:01 What’s the best way to infuse olive oil? Also what’s your favourite cookie recipe? 
1991 2018-08-28 19:31:58 Ooo mine were slightly different... used wholemeal flour, coconut sugar & coconut oil 
1992 2018-08-28 19:31:48 Wasn't the Great Salad Oil Swindle November 1963? Vague memory that it only ended without complete disaster because someone shot the President and knocked Aldous Huxley's death off the front page.

1995 2018-08-28 19:31:34 You keep Calling Ignoring People Biafra.  The undertone to your Statement is loud.  But that's not the Point. The reason Why Nigeria Retains that Spot in Africa is Due to Oil and Gas and We have Maintained that Position since the Time Of Jonathan. So No thanks to Buhari
1996 2018-08-28 19:31:28 Keep hydrateing, a cold compress on your head or face, cool dark quite room. I put lavender or peppermint oil in my diffuser but you probably don't have all that. I also take Aleve. The cold compress helps the most.

2003 2018-08-28 19:30:49 Oh I was not gonna let up on them and they knew that.  I was ready for that fight.  Plus the fact that I took a video of me checking the oil yesterday that showed there wasn't no oil in it, how were they gonna argue that.

2061 2018-08-28 19:24:24 In 2014, the oil crash led to large unemployment (aka recession) but stock market went up. Could the longest bull run in history be a result of unforeseen consequences from QE and the government bailout? Based on new economic indicators, did the US already skip our downturn?

2208 2018-08-28 19:07:50 @senJamesInhofe Probalby dictated this demonic screed. This state respects oil rigs more than The Cross.
2209 2018-08-28 19:07:47 I just had the best customer service experience at @valvoline getting my oil changed. Like seriously, compared to 5 star resort good.
2210 2018-08-28 19:07:45 Can’t wait for solid coconut oil weather.
2211 2018-08-28 19:07:14 Have you tried turmeric paste (cooked with an oil and freshly cracked black pepper)? It’s much more bioavailable to the body in that form, if you just take the powder you aren’t really absorbing it. It’s magic stuff with incredible anti inflammatory properties!!
2212 2018-08-28 19:07:12 @marksandspencer love the Irish Brown Soda Bread with extra virgin olive oil Houmous 
2213 2018-08-28 19:07:05 question is how fast will this happen, given that oil prices are working in the other direction?

and in Turkey's case, getting rid of the current account deficit is necessary but not sufficient if external debt doesn't roll ...
2214 2018-08-28 19:06:59 Daily scalp/face routine: MG217 3% Coal Tar for psoriasis, Thayers witch hazel as a toner, Texas Beard Co Oil brushed in to moisturize. Need a recommendation for some SPF. My perfect skin secret is accutane tho 
2215 2018-08-28 19:06:55 I can only wear for about 3 seconds before my oil slick nose decides it won’t play ball
2216 2018-08-28 19:06:48  it is true.  Am watching news on Spark TV where minister Sseninde says @GovUganda can't work on all school.
I agree with you he is here for oil deal and retirement package.
2217 2018-08-28 19:06:38 Lindsey Graham is a SELF-SERVING snake oil politician CROOK; it is you who are confused
2218 2018-08-28 19:06:29 3. Study theology all you want but truth is we rot when we die, stop selling to Kenyans the same snake oil that colonial powers beat your ancestors to death so that they can memorize verbatim
2219 2018-08-28 19:06:16 First oil is not good, then rice , then wheat, then sugar, then salt... what else. And it's so much food out in market with varieties. So important the purity of food without any chemicals. Anything in right quantity is always good under nature's laws.
2220 2018-08-28 19:06:14 I have been trying in vain to get in touch with my pain doctor to arrange an appointment to discuss alternative is to narcotics. Message six was just left 10 minutes ago. do you put the oil on your food or do you take it straight? i'm assuming it's less addictive than pills??
2221 2018-08-28 19:06:11 That time you buy an essential oil blend that has a name that sounds really nice & poetic, but it smells too much like the old pine air freshener that your parents hung from the rearview mirror in their mini-van. And you think you want to throw it out, but feel guilty about it.
2222 2018-08-28 19:06:07 Mike, Hmm?! Is that 10w-30 pumpkin spice oil!  #LOL #PSL
2223 2018-08-28 19:05:58 Ok let’s give Modi the Bharat Ratna. Then the question arises, for what ? 1. 2002 riots 2. Vajpayee disowning him 3. Demo 4. Rafael 5. Gujarat oil scam 6. Gau rakhshaks. List can go on.

2229 2018-08-28 19:05:32 Venezuelans can solve their own issues. The only reason Venezuela is an American issue is Venezuela holds the worlds largest oil reserves. Venezuela has been sanctioned, and embargoed into their current economic chaos by the IMF, the world banks that want that oil for themselves

2231 2018-08-28 19:05:27 Well I’ve been on many NATO operations and I must admit oil and its derivatives helped our mobility in doing good. It’s the snarling “certainty” that’s the most irritating.
2232 2018-08-28 19:05:06 Bet you can’t wait for oil drilling off your coast. They don’t stop.

2240 2018-08-28 19:04:16 If u live in Colorado, vote NO on 97. Its a way for basically Boulder and Erie to shut down oil and gas production all together. 97 would end close to 200,000 Jobs in Colorado by 2020 and would delete close to 32 billion of the 240 billion in the states annual budget.
2241 2018-08-28 19:03:59 The innocent civilians were collateral damage, not the objective.

Ask yourself this question: Would the Bush administration and the other warhawks have had the United States invade Iraq if they did not posess oil resources?

2251 2018-08-28 19:02:45 No, definitely an O2 generator, loaded with an O2 candle, which was initiated using a blank 4/10 cartridge. Candle were prone to exploding if contaminated by oil....just to add to the fun....

2258 2018-08-28 19:02:09 Aint gonna work this time Senator. You can fool us once but not twice. Will you be illegally putting in Goldman Sacks cash in this campaign too? We Texans are tired of snake oil salesmen from Canada. We've got a real Texan to send to Washington.

2266 2018-08-28 19:01:09 That was given as an update at 3pm afternoon? Oil added just after. Now 12 hours later the pump station should have power? Listen we appreciate guys working around the clock really we do, but you made empty promises to communities about ETR. This makes planning a nightmare!
2267 2018-08-28 19:01:01 Perhaps you missed the part where Chavez nationalized the oil industry. Before nationalization, Venezuela received about 20% of the profits for Venezuelan oil. After nationalization that number is almost 100%.

2273 2018-08-28 19:00:04 Oil is worthless per se. It is only useful as energy. And energy is used in production of goods. Which you then need to sell to someone.  Many ways to skin the Russian pussycat.

2277 2018-08-28 18:59:51 That’s bunk, Brad, and you know it. Tax receipts are down in Alberta because of the global collapse in the price of oil. That ALWAYS happens during an oil bust. It has nothing to do with the new tax rates.

2282 2018-08-28 18:59:17 Sorry, I must have missed your argument? If I needed snake oil I'd syphon it off you.
2283 2018-08-28 18:59:03 Germany is in the pocket of Russia due to its dependence on gas and oil imports.

France has always acted in France’s best interests.

The rest of EU either does what it’s told by Germany or is too irrelevant to matter.

We’re better off out.
2284 2018-08-28 18:58:53 For those who don't know, the Dib is the smallest unit of dabbage, the minimum you can put on the tool and legitimately offer it to a toker. Then it goes Dib, Dab, Glob, Slab in base 3 (1 Slab = 3 Globs = 9 Dabs = 27 Dibs) cuz dividing oil by 3s can be done by sight, >3 can't.

2288 2018-08-28 18:58:26 La principal ventaja es eliminar el flúor de pastas y enjuagues, y luego  mejor limpieza sobre todo con el oil pulling. Desventajas pocas, quizás no es tan "refrescante" y se tarda un poco más.
2289 2018-08-28 18:58:05 Having my blonde hair ...more deep conditioner....more hot oil treatments.... use oil in my daily hair routine ....these are the things I have to work on cus my hair needs to stay poppin
2290 2018-08-28 18:58:02 This is correct. Coffee and pumpkin/pumpkin spice were never meant to be together. Much like oil and water, it just doesn’t work.

2301 2018-08-28 18:56:26 The greenhouse industry in the Westland area just north of Rotterdam is pretty damn impressive. They even pipe in waste CO2 from nearby oil refineries. But they sure aren't growing corn or potatoes.
2302 2018-08-28 18:56:25 You're right. It's probably the  one of the most hazardous jobs in the sector. But we can't afford to import crude oil and pay people that kind of salary. Compensation means very little when you have to use that same money on your health.
2303 2018-08-28 18:56:15 Aye @OBJ_3 remember that time at football camp I was throwing dimes to you and LSU offered you right after?  I don’t either but man let me hold something i need a oil change....
2304 2018-08-28 18:55:55 Wow, senility has really kicked in. B/c of him, CIA etc, Iran was in upheaval. Which in turn caused the gas shortage. Lest we forget this feckless "leader" didn't turn around the decision by Nixon to use oil as a commodity to back our dollar as opposed to gold. #DecadesOfWar
2305 2018-08-28 18:55:51 Yeah he said he is sorry, and now really needs some work so he can afford rent and..what? Oh I'm sorry. No I mean he needs us all to jack off his ego so he can feel big again, so get some oil.

2309 2018-08-28 18:55:37 Reminder: ACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE. Take local, collective, systematic and political action. Push for bans/restrictions/rations on oil/gas, subsidize Carbon Capture facilities (now actually viable tech! Net negative is a possibility.) Etc. Do your part, vote, protest, organize.
2310 2018-08-28 18:55:19 Not that is not true, gas engines are not in idle, they are using motor break, so cero consumption of oil.
What they are not doing generally is recovering energy like you.
2311 2018-08-28 18:55:11 drilling shit rules. i totally get where those oil moguls are coming from
2312 2018-08-28 18:55:10 3 years with @MBuhari and yet 90% of our revenue is still from crude oil. #SaveOurDemocracy #PDPTakingOver #YourPVCyourVoice @OfficialPDPNig @APCNigeria

After all, who would want those poor kids traumatised, if a limb was to snap off?  Those poor children have suffered enough...
2314 2018-08-28 18:55:00 I've made a terrible mistake. I spilled a few drops of eucalyptus oil on the carpet in my office and now I'm aromatherapying the hallway. I shut my door partway to be considerate of my poor colleagues, but now the soothing smell is putting me to sleep. Send coffee! 
2315 2018-08-28 18:54:58 LOL,,you are a gift Alasair
Unionists dont like ot when told scots would be a rich country if our many resources were kept in scotland for the 8Million and not have 92% go south to look after 65Million.
They even disrespected scots after scots oil propped westminster up
2316 2018-08-28 18:54:50 I experienced the mythical “Black ice” of Florida. For those unaware, it’s not really ice, but oil that coats the ground and gets nice and slick during the rain. I did in fact hydroplane and crash my car. Nothing broken! Just hurting a lot!

2327 2018-08-28 18:53:36 Nothing worse than hearing some girl say “well, guess I’m gonna spend $18 on tanning oil” when you literally have a $0 balance in your checking account
2328 2018-08-28 18:53:26 Everyone who finds oil thinks they’re going to be Norway, but at best they’re going to be Venezuela.
2329 2018-08-28 18:53:23 Senator @tedcruz helped lead the fight to rob Texans’ future of a clean environment by refusing to acknowledge climate change & bigger paychecks by passing the #GOPTaxScam. So irresponsible he’s considering taxpayer money to protect big oil from climate change. #TXSen #VoteBlue
2330 2018-08-28 18:53:22 Bartrand likes to make me deal with the harbormaster. That man always smells like cod liver oil.
2331 2018-08-28 18:53:02 You can try coining! Better if you have eucalyptus oil but lotion works just as well! It helps to expel the toxins in your body! Or even doing a homemade sauna with a pot of hot water and a steam bath with eucalyptus oil...that always helped me. Old wives remedies
2332 2018-08-28 18:52:51 Lol! Oh I see. I didn’t know it came in a pill form. It can be quite expensive when it comes to oil  I paid $82 for 1FL oz 
2333 2018-08-28 18:52:42 What a cool pic - Stevie is my favorite guitarist of all time, and you're my favorite that's out there now.

2336 2018-08-28 18:52:36 Keep taxes low. Give rich people tax breaks. Subsidize big oil. Make coal great again. That's the right for you.
2337 2018-08-28 18:52:35 Stay prostrate before God. Stay under. Stay humble. Oil can only flow from above.
2338 2018-08-28 18:52:25 Under what jurisdiction, in what capacity,under what guise ,on whose authority,seconded by who are you ending my tweet , i mean the audacity to perpetuate such heinous crime against my thread
2339 2018-08-28 18:52:21 I used to care about the rest of the UK when i voted labour 30 years but they dont care for scots ,,they think they subsidise scots cos thier media has told them that for 40 years/I believe in scotland and indy.
Westminster blew thier chance when they bankrupted an oil rich UK
2340 2018-08-28 18:52:19 Right now an avacado is about 3-4$ a piece and coconut oil is cheap cuz there’s so many brands (under $5 for a 500ml bottle unless it’s a “big brand”  but I still get it even cheaper from home
2341 2018-08-28 18:52:08 @Tzeporah How can you sleep at night and support the one-sided environmental BS you spout? The Saudis must pay you well to support Saudi and Venezuelan oil sales to California over Canadian oil? Why not leave, move to one of those destinations and support their lies in-house?
2342 2018-08-28 18:52:04 Who is going to lather the oil on...?
2343 2018-08-28 18:52:00 Have you tried soaking your entire body in coconut oil? It heals any and everything.
2344 2018-08-28 18:51:55 oil
2345 2018-08-28 18:51:40 Yes. The other side of the commercial hedge is the speculator. A 50/50 mix is nice. But if a market becomes too weighted to speculation, look out. But remember, like with$140 oil...for every buyer there is a seller. There are also commercial long hedgers.
2346 2018-08-28 18:51:28 I feel like the ordinary 5% retinoid oil worked just as well for a fraction of the price for me!
2347 2018-08-28 18:51:26 He didn't put the plug back in so all the oil came out.
2348 2018-08-28 18:51:21 Can you imagine Americans out of poverty able to pay for universal healthcare an research and development of oil replacements and medical advances.  Keep peddling that rubbish.

Thanks!
2352 2018-08-28 18:51:08 The episode that Ramsey broadcasts a message implicating the Navy in a disaster. Captain and others went to oil rig to disconnect Valkyrie network where Lt Bivas (Burk’s crush) lost her life due to Bomb explosion

2357 2018-08-28 18:50:34 Westminster has taken 92% for 40 years and STILL managed to near bankrupt the OIL RICH UK
They did`nt show gratitude though they have dissed scpts at every turn and unionists are HAPPY WITH THAT!

No they had a chance and blew it
2358 2018-08-28 18:50:29 They counted utilities? That includes cable/satellite TV and cellphone service. Hardly essential.
2359 2018-08-28 18:50:28 Great! Let's declare war on North Dakota and occupy the Williston Basin/Bakken oil fields. Our National Guard is better than their National Guard! #mtpol
2360 2018-08-28 18:50:17 I was watching and was surprised how good it was straightening. For a self proclaimed hairstylist she sure made lots of poor choices. The oil she used is good for hair. I use the same stuff just a different brand.
2361 2018-08-28 18:50:15 Time to give the car  break and some TLC .. oil change .. air filter changes .. tire rotation .. dealership eyeballs .. as I relax in a Wyndham hotel and get my laundry done.
2362 2018-08-28 18:50:13 i cannot tell the last time i wore makeup. whenever i think imma beat my face, i just throw on hoops and massage some coconut oil into my skin.

2369 2018-08-28 18:49:26 Not really. Salad cream only uses the yolk. It's mostly vegetable oil and vinegar. A bit of mustard.

2374 2018-08-28 18:48:52 All these graphs and stats implying Trump inherited great economy from Obama are so intellectually dishonest. Simple question. If Trump is doing everything Opposite of O, like deregulation, mine coal, drill oil, lower taxes, then why do these Econ stats keep rising??
2375 2018-08-28 18:48:27 And that's how a mad thread ended
2376 2018-08-28 18:48:08 That’s what the randomization is for . The trial was set up properly to evaluate the benefit of fish oil . You can argue that findings in diabetics may not apply to all, of course .
2377 2018-08-28 18:47:59 maybe they want that small oil leak to be in front of your house instead of their driveway

2384 2018-08-28 18:46:51 @Thom_Hartmann Ok, so what's the truth? Tom Perez says no oil money is being accepted, & yet we keep seeing tweets, etc, to the contrary. Wish you'd ask him why they keep countering/fighting Progressive candidates? I Vote Progressive first, then Dem.

2387 2018-08-28 18:46:47 Very mad thread. Ended again
2388 2018-08-28 18:46:46 And everything I peeped, can't just unsee
2389 2018-08-28 18:46:41 Says the man who openly supports candidates who deny the existence of climate change and thinks coal and oil are the most glorious resources on the planet.

And you probably want South Africa for their diamonds. And to collaborate with DeBeers and FF+ to bring back Apartheid.

2392 2018-08-28 18:46:12 Look. No regrets but I'm pretty sure I've been sweating deep fryer oil since this past weekend at the MN State Fair because my skin is a mess right now....

But damn that deep fried pizza on a stick was delicious.
2393 2018-08-28 18:46:11 Fine, in d last 3yrs, APC rakes in $94bn oil money while GEJ earned far more. It simply  mean that APC has problem wit diversification. If oil dries today, APC govt will shutdown
2394 2018-08-28 18:46:10 And this is new, news. He's been a snake oil salesman all his life

2396 2018-08-28 18:46:08 Capitalism is in the late stages of destroying its ecosystem so not surprising. Energy & Society, Fred Cottrell, first looked at this in 1955. Energy density: example rowing a ship vs wind power vs coal then oil for steam power. High grade iron ore vs taconite low grade iron ore
2397 2018-08-28 18:46:07 I'm curious to know what your responsible sourcing programme consists of, seeing as 85% of all palm oil is sourced from Indonesia and Malaysia, and orangutans are only in Indonesia and Malaysia #savetheorangutan #stopdeforestation #palmoil
2398 2018-08-28 18:46:05 We’ll speak on that later. But what you feel about working in the oil field 2500 a week type shit

They went to illegal war in Iraq for oil
there is no way they will let scots walk away with thier oil without an effort to keep it.
This is westminster we are dealing with here
they lost an empire through unfairness and have treated scots like a colony
2402 2018-08-28 18:45:46 The quietest drive train I've ever experienced was after cleaning and soaking the chain in motor oil. I know that quietness is not equal to efficiency (necessarily).
2403 2018-08-28 18:45:33 To speak in such a way at John McCain and what he stood for I guess nothing rubbed off on our traitor. Meanwhile Lindsey Graham is willing to sell the coastline of South Carolina 2 Big Oil companies he goes plays golf with this Russian loving freak and now all of his views change
2404 2018-08-28 18:45:29 Ouch! She needs some oil for those stiff joints

2412 2018-08-28 18:45:01 My scar tissue where I had a skin graft was getting swollen and my nerves began firing. Moments after I put on my CDB oil it stopped hurting and it was already starting to go back to it's regular size... How is this illegal in Arizona but narcotics aren't? Thank u Portland
2413 2018-08-28 18:45:00 So much wrong with this tweet, Line 1 will move refined fuels and light crude, The majority of the bitumen will likely end up being refined in North America (while fetching world oil price) and biggest, no sensible politician is suggesting the gov't get into refining business

2419 2018-08-28 18:43:54 Aye, we had essential oil plug ins at my home, but I refuse to use them after reading an article about how they can cause cancer in cats, considering I have three cats in my home? I wish not to run that risk.

2431 2018-08-28 18:42:19 I'm going to go out on a limb and say that if your ad copy has to include the phrase "this isn't snake oil pills" then you are 100% selling snake oil pills.

Also, maybe don't reinforce the stereotype you should be embarrassed to talk to a doctor about erectile dysfunction.

2463 2018-08-28 18:38:19 he is not dumb. Shutting down nuclear in CA means that he can "sell" his gigafactory services to the state with the support of the politicians known to have connection with the gas and oil industry.

2477 2018-08-28 18:36:55 fao food index fall mainly for sugar and vegetable oils, but cereals dairy and meat are a little lower but still 60-99% higher than 2003. and also don't forget about distribution cost that with oil at 80$ with currency falling against $ put another stress on lower income.
2478 2018-08-28 18:36:49 My sister and I don't talk much, but because she uses my #PrimeAccount I always get notifications when she orders something. It's like catching a little glimpse into her life.

2486 2018-08-28 18:36:18 Not even cause of the price crash. The oil price and gas prices closely linked. When oil price low, gas price usually low as well
2487 2018-08-28 18:36:18 I want to put you in a bathtub full of baby oil and watch you try to get out without hurting yourself
2488 2018-08-28 18:36:05 However,it is important to look into all components of inflation.consumer goods such as electronics,clothing,remains stable,while energy oil,gas increasing. So a mixed bag ,but real wage increases reflect current positive trend in economy,which in itself is somewhat inflationary.
2489 2018-08-28 18:35:33 I agree, people who bitch about subsidizing the green technology are fine with the oil industry and the auto industry being subsidized. B
2490 2018-08-28 18:35:30 Exactly right! Floridas economy is heavily driven by Tourism. Who wants to swim in oil slicks and go to beaches that have oil all over the sand! TX beaches have oil balls on the sand & it’s pathetic that they aren’t supporting solar power, but no  for these crooks to pocket!
2491 2018-08-28 18:35:25 I'm so ill I just nearly added Shloer to the cooking pan instead of oil
2492 2018-08-28 18:35:20 Old people are always so fucking difficult. Listen Helen you haven’t gotten your oil change since 2016, you were not here earlier this year you whacko.
2493 2018-08-28 18:35:09 Why are canned sardines without oil so much more expensive than sardines in sunflower oil or even olive oil?
2494 2018-08-28 18:35:03 @McVities why do u use palm oil in some products +not others? Every year, mil acres of rainforest r destroyed + replaced by huge palm oil plantations. Deprived of their natural habitat, orangutans starve. When they feed off palm fruits on plantations, they’re shot.
2495 2018-08-28 18:34:57 Plenty of good evidence available now that shows consumption of sat fat isn’t harmful. EVOO & Virgin Coconut Oil for example actually raise HDL-c whilst having little effect on LDL-c. The cholesterol ratios are most important: Trig/HDL and TC/HDL ratios better risk predictions.
2496 2018-08-28 18:34:54 I’m sure he would agree with you. Something about the oil being good for joints, right?

2499 2018-08-28 18:34:49 $65 puts were $0.28 last night upon hearing the rumors in oil market. They have the potential of being $5+ in a few weeks.
2500 2018-08-28 18:34:48 No one is nationalising the "oil industry". Without oil everyone in Canada would be dead within 2 months. You should be overjoyed there is oil.
2501 2018-08-28 18:34:47 Combination of black seed & coconut oil should do... topical and internal.
Green Papaya powder in ya smoothies for a while for the internal also.
Hope it helps! 
2502 2018-08-28 18:34:40 Light can never work with darkness in as much as oil will never mix with water.

2503 2018-08-28 18:34:40 I need oil
2504 2018-08-28 18:34:30 And they are VERY smart. My buddy raised 20 pigs one summer. 1 ran away, one died of unknown cause and the other 18 we could not keep penned. 

We finally gave up. They wandered around the farm eating AND routing in the oil pit - for sunscreen! 

Pre-enviro laws of course. 1/2
2505 2018-08-28 18:34:23 No worry... You'll get used to it, speaking of which, great profile pic, almost asked which oil painting that was...
2506 2018-08-28 18:34:18 Things I have accomplished today:
• Oil change
• Replenished box making supplies
• Dropped off loads for charity
• Took out the trash
• Replenished paints
• Dropped off packages in the mail.

And it’s only the early afternoon. Some days I’m on 
2507 2018-08-28 18:34:11 I dare say Canada's resources are far greater than ours. Canada has one of the largest heavy metals supply in the world. Mexico has one of the greatest oil supplies in the world, along with fertile land and minerals.
2508 2018-08-28 18:34:10 It will not make you hungry. Its the thc that increases your appetite. Full spectrum oil contains a minimal amount of thc.

2516 2018-08-28 18:33:38 Wow ... so it’s bad over there, too!

Here in the US, the Republicans named to “environmental” posts are all from Big Oil/Energy, & they don’t even try to hide it.  Everyone’s beholden to the might Koch bros.

So if US & Europe aren’t leading the way, who is?
2517 2018-08-28 18:33:28 Daddy lol we have been a natural gas based economy. Transition occurred late 80s, early 90s. We were losing money with petrotin and in the grander scheme of things, we didn’t earn as much revenue from oil when compared to natural gas.
2518 2018-08-28 18:33:24 I say the kit is a good deal cause you get to try it all & also the oil is very good
2519 2018-08-28 18:33:11 oil and water will forever be a fav from lights so underrated so melodic

2521 2018-08-28 18:32:53 The oil industry's own scientists knew about global warming and its consequences in the late 1960s and could have invested in protecting their facilities long ago.

It is ironic that one of the most profitable industries in the country wants government hand outs. #WelfareQueens

2543 2018-08-28 18:30:08 Even more than other venture firms, I'd love to be able to "shadow" across industries -- just watch operations at a manufacturing plant or oil field for a week
2544 2018-08-28 18:30:07 How do the lobbyists that work for the big oil companies respond to this witchcraft way of thinking?
2545 2018-08-28 18:30:04 Super--what? What's the Income tax rate? It's better to say we are underpaid. If we were super taxed, we will not be super dependent on Oil and IMF/WB Loans.
2546 2018-08-28 18:29:46 @LindseyGrahamSC How can u give such an emotional speech about Sen. John McCain on the Senate floor; & yet praise #ToxicTrump at the same time? It’s like oil & water!

2550 2018-08-28 18:29:20 correct. Pseudoscience is a disease that is killing people. Snake oil and made up diseases treated by doctors that don't take insurance - all sounds legit right? wrong. Legit doctors use research backed treatments and scientific data
2551 2018-08-28 18:29:15 Speaker of the House @PhilipGunnMS announces that they should have a decision from the Governor within the hour on whether or not he will extend the call to BP Oil money #msleg
2552 2018-08-28 18:29:13 @boonepickens we have solar energy technology that recovers the 4-8 % oil that is in produced water (about 440 to 880 barrels per day). During that process, we make 2.4 megawatts of electricity for free. This electricity can be used as a base load for wind energy. Perfect match
2553 2018-08-28 18:29:04 canabis oil is not a opiate ! This is crazy
2554 2018-08-28 18:29:02 Libertarians are the ones funding the entire right. Wealthy libertarians who want to deregualte everything so they can exploit those who dont have the resources to compete business wise. Thats a recipe for fascism. Certain industries NEED oversight. Pharma, Oil, banking etc...
2555 2018-08-28 18:28:48 LOOOOL fam I do not oil and wrap my hair for this comparison. I do not keep my BMI in triple digits for my thighs to be recognised as slim. Do better 
2556 2018-08-28 18:28:34 yes and all that oil money from saudi arabia that goes to paying our politicians so they can tell the media to make it seem like islam is compatible with our constitutions and charter of rights and freedoms
2557 2018-08-28 18:28:33 Here's an Idea. How bout u lower the cost of OIL!? Or even better, make more Ethanol refineries so we can have E85 @ every station for ½ the cost of Petrol. This way we cut back on our emissions by 80% & @ the same time put Millions of $$$ back into the pockets of AMERICANS!

2562 2018-08-28 18:28:13 Not that I've tested for intensity, but I'd say a 1/2 oz of zest, ground with the sugar before creaming would be a good start, then lemon extract (oil) to taste in the batter. Maybe a lemon syrup soak?
2563 2018-08-28 18:28:01 Osibanjo asked Gej and Obj to come and account  how they spent the money gotten from the sale of oil for the past 16yrs but his buhari led government can't give account for just three years.
2564 2018-08-28 18:27:50 @JustinTrudeau and the oil goons AKA @rcmpgrcpolice better be ready to kill us over this shit.  There is NO chance this is going through without a major conflict.
2565 2018-08-28 18:27:48 Cameco shutting down McArthur River is the equivalent of Saudi Arabia halting oil production entirely.  Think about that for a moment.

2576 2018-08-28 18:26:15 I'm bleaching my hair tomorrow, and I put a disgusting amount of coconut oil in my hair.. it's so.. greasy.
2577 2018-08-28 18:26:12 When the oil dries up, do you think the oil companies will say "hey thanks for the use of your hospitals, infrastructure, etc" and pony up some cash for them or real cleanup of the tailing ponds? nope they are laughing all the way to bank.
2578 2018-08-28 18:26:12 I spent 35 minutes doing my hair *barely* & forgot to put on deodorant and properly oil my legs  why do I hate myself.

2584 2018-08-28 18:25:32 Surely an investment in green energy/batteries would be better than relying on oil
2585 2018-08-28 18:25:08 @jeneuston this can be prevented with coconut oil on the skin. Ticks will not bite you and if they do they die.
2586 2018-08-28 18:25:06 I was thinking the VLCC could have preferred to divert to Brazil instead, pick up crude there first and then return to Jose to co-load Venezuelan oil. Would make sense, I have seen this before when line for loading at VZ ports is too long
2587 2018-08-28 18:24:57 2/2. He alienated the brothers in the union and after 2 months was advised by his foreman to leave the job before, “someone hurts you”. It was a time of 1 man 1 job. But dad didn’t adhere to that and just kept doing jobs that needed doing, ie, tighten a loose screw & oil a hinge.
2588 2018-08-28 18:24:44 My dad called me at 9 this morning to ask if I got the oil changed in my car yet?? Lol
2589 2018-08-28 18:24:44 Lmaooo not the “oil spill” though

2592 2018-08-28 18:24:04 India is the major buyer of Iranian oil! Will USA also ask India to stop buying oil from Iran! Will India listen to USA? If it is so then what about Indo-Iran relationship?
2593 2018-08-28 18:24:00 ok, besides illegal stills, obviously a stolen oil takes aprt in taxidermy . they dep fry humans. I have tried to explain they do this to the very rich and what appears to be the very poor. they aren't poor at ll. they are apartide victims.
2594 2018-08-28 18:24:00 Like Canada has traded at a deficit with us most years! Just let it go and deal with tariffs!  Duh???? Car tariffs hurt both countries &  Canada will retaliate with higher oil prices! Discuss dairy tariff that protects a dying Cdn industry & Canada asks about our lumber tariff!

2615 2018-08-28 18:21:16 Says the guy who implemented an oil embargo and gas rationing. Perhaps his willingness to abandon the Shah of Iran helped? And he lost by a landslide to a guy who campaigned by asking Americans to consider if they were better off today than they were when Carter was elected. Hmm
2616 2018-08-28 18:20:56 All the things others have mentioned: good sleep, healthy food, time-outs, exercise, emotional catharsis (aka a brief cry in the privacy room or a scream and hitting of things in the privacy of your home - a personal fav), CBD oil and, occasionally, finding another job.
2617 2018-08-28 18:20:48 When I hear Italian court.  What comes to mind is that oil well and that former minister of justice.  There's also a goodluck involved!
2618 2018-08-28 18:20:48 Freke get oil for him head.
The anointing dey sharp.
2619 2018-08-28 18:20:47 I don't know what projections look like, there are a lot of citizens certainly. but I think the idea would be to get at wealth outside of oil too. @MattBruenig might have some more specifics?
2620 2018-08-28 18:20:45 If you use doctors that don't take insurance - and make you pay out of pocket....they are going to diagnose you with anything so you will pay them. They are snake oil salesman with Medical Degrees. Still Thieves #Afflicted
2621 2018-08-28 18:20:42 I can do all the little maintenance things like change a light, a tire and change a radio system....but I CANNOT change my own oil.....
2622 2018-08-28 18:20:27 No dear they are using mineral water not oil or CNG
2623 2018-08-28 18:20:26 But the question is wht is ur implication? Modi is not taking this money home. Govt. Is earning more. Spending more. States are getting higher share. Compare wht states were getting earlier & now. Also talk abt the liability of oil bonds that upa issued and nda repaid.

2625 2018-08-28 18:20:06 Why isnt big oil scrutinized like this?...
2626 2018-08-28 18:19:58 I am an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer and I know by just giving fuel cost is really not correct, as it consumes oil too and repeated use of Helicopter causes higher maintenance costs which are very high compared to a car. IK needs to see who is advising him.
2627 2018-08-28 18:19:40 i got an oil change and the man pur air in my tires too i feel like a brand new bitch

2637 2018-08-28 18:18:56 All the oil money went over the border.
2638 2018-08-28 18:18:55 the next time i hear  somebody tell me or share on social media that turmeric, coconut oil, vitamin c,  meditation or vipasana  can cure cancer i will slap them. Hard. And ask them to STFU and grow a brain. Over and over again. Maa kasam ...

2642 2018-08-28 18:18:47 Owwwww... A bit of lavender oil soothes burns 
2643 2018-08-28 18:18:43 Sure if you want to go elsewhere to find the Churchill falls electricity NY state and others rely on or replace the 2.5 million barrels of oil a day, or replace the Uranium needed for the power plants and of course Nukes. Then there is the prescious minerals ie diamonds.
2644 2018-08-28 18:18:40 I just ate a mushroom risotto with white wine sauce, thyme and truffle oil

I'm all over this making ourselves happy thing. Food and exercise is a great way to get it.
2645 2018-08-28 18:18:36 All I use is coconut oil. Sometimes avocado oil.

2647 2018-08-28 18:18:35 Essential oil diffuser/topical application - @SajeWellness makes a great one! No dairy Keep your neck covered with a scarf. Use your voice minimally. Tea w/ honey
2648 2018-08-28 18:18:33 That is very correct. Capitalism as we know it can't function when oil goes much above $60 a barrel as we saw in 2008. Global oil production has plateaued in the last decade with an inevitable decline coming when we will have higher demand...
2649 2018-08-28 18:18:32 This is what am craving for:

Oil rice(angua mmo), grounded pepper, sardines, fried eggs (just 2) and some pork chops . 
And don't forget a bottle of chilled coca cola

2653 2018-08-28 18:17:51 I’ve always been really lucky and only had super light ones so I haven’t really spent any time trying to find something that works :-( But I will gladly send you some vitamin E oil as well 
2654 2018-08-28 18:17:50 LOVE YOU OIL AND I MISS UR FACE COME BACK SOON
2655 2018-08-28 18:17:38 Sure when as president you said Oil would run out in 1978 and wore a sweater in the White House to give an example to set your heater to a lower temp. Or made the speed limit 50mph ect. So I guess you had no ideal about finance.
2656 2018-08-28 18:17:28 us defence secretary is fresh from masturbating in saudi oil and yemen child blood to say he hasn't seen anything wrong with arms sales and aid to saudi  #c4news

2658 2018-08-28 18:17:14 Chickpea curry. Onions, garlic, coriander seeds, cumin, etc. Fry in olive oil. Add aubergine, potato, fresh tomatoes (tinned if necessary) cauliflower (optional) and then a tin of chick peas.  Knock yourself out with the variations!
2659 2018-08-28 18:17:14 The Chinese don't advertise their atrocities, Gulf states want to sell oil, and buy weapons and tech, and the west wants access to Chinese markets. So the Uyghurs get sacrificed.
2660 2018-08-28 18:17:11 I'm looking for great reading: books, articles, papers on oil exploration in recent years in the United States, environmental impact, economic dependence, and especially a great summary of oil lobbies and their influence. Suggestions?
2661 2018-08-28 18:17:03 Wow. Half a trillion. About the same as the value of the Exxon/Rosneft Arctic Sea oil drilling deal Putin needs to happen so badly, but bad Obama blew up w/his sanctions. Tough break for the Tsar. Russian economy going round and round in toilet. Wherever will he find that money?
2662 2018-08-28 18:17:02 If we had a fund like Norway's, how much money could each person/family receive, given we have the largest (or near largest) oil production in world?
2663 2018-08-28 18:16:56 @IAMSAFAREE You already sell coconut oil, and now a dildo. Coconut lube only seems natural! Secure the bag, sir!
2664 2018-08-28 18:16:55 Try adding a drop or 2 of peppermint essential oil in your favorite oil concoction and give yourself a nice scalp masaage. The menthol helps increase blood circulation in your scalp which is supposed to support hair growth
2665 2018-08-28 18:16:48 You don't seem like the type of person who is interested in curbing fossil fuel emissions and reducing our dependance on oil, but correct me if I'm wrong.
2666 2018-08-28 18:16:47 主人公補正とか、実力が及ばない相手に対してなんだか分からないけど勝つってストーリーも熱くて嫌いじゃないんだよ。寧ろ好きなものも沢山ある。けど、一番好きなのは強者が強者である作品なんだよな。。後味最悪、胸糞悪い本は昔より読まなくなったけど、たぶんまだ好き。オバロ原作買うかー。

2668 2018-08-28 18:16:38 Petrotrin is producing 40,000 barrels of oil but has to import 100,000 barrels to keep the refinery going...

So it’s simple, for us to continue to refine oil we’d lose billions of dollars 

Simple math 

This is a very sticky situation

2682 2018-08-28 18:14:52 So much extra time just to ensure the leaves don't scatter oil droplets everywhere and ruin your clothes.
2683 2018-08-28 18:14:50 "Go with you to see Sandra? Id rather boil my head in oil"!!!  I do love Robert Sugden!!
2684 2018-08-28 18:14:32 "Curtailment of free enterprise"? Yeah, ok. Like the environment operated in by big banks, car makers, oil companies? 
'Tis to laugh.
2685 2018-08-28 18:14:09 I’m sure it has nothing to do with the Feds war on the Oil and Gas industry.
2686 2018-08-28 18:13:59 Hide the baby oil!
2687 2018-08-28 18:13:55 Recent report showing Oil companies are asking the federal government for millions to help them build a sea wall along the Gulf of Mexico to protect refineries. It’s almost like, even as they deny it to their stupid Republican voters, they know it’s coming. Anything to say @GOP ?
2688 2018-08-28 18:13:34 If Trump should not regulate Google search results and we should all trust Google to do the best for us...will Standard Oil be reconstituted and compensated for its breaking up, for very similar reasons?
2689 2018-08-28 18:13:27 We can always rely on you to have an unfunny contribution, Pete. The truth is, we DO need the Saudi oil.
2690 2018-08-28 18:13:19 Hello @seunokin @ctvpolitics please tell that Mr Okeowo in your studio that oil doesn't make up 90% of our GDP. 

That man is terribly misinformed. He should drop out of the race. And his attempt at twisting his comments on The Couch is an insult on our intelligence.

2694 2018-08-28 18:12:53 Enbridge and Michigan's Governor Snyder made a backroom deal to explore building a tunnel for Canadian oil under the Great Lakes. SIGN THE PETITION opposing this horrible idea. #RetireLine5
2695 2018-08-28 18:12:50 @seunokin 90% of our GDP is not oil according to your guest, the Presidential aspirant.
2696 2018-08-28 18:12:38 Actually it does. Geothermal. We're just slaves to oil.
2697 2018-08-28 18:12:37 I don't like the free market when it's not free. The oil barons of old are the social media CEOs of today
2698 2018-08-28 18:12:34 Support #localfarmers, reduce American dependence on foreign oil AND improve your engine performance by filling your tank with E30.
2699 2018-08-28 18:12:22 Impossible.  We are constantly reminded that oil plays a very small part in the overall Canadian economy.

2702 2018-08-28 18:12:14 This attitude that soldiers are "protecting the country" is the biggest fallacy ever. All they're doing is protecting the interests of the government and state sponsored corporations. What are they protecting by bombing Middle Eastern civilians? Oil wells, and that's it.
2703 2018-08-28 18:12:08 Regulation is socialism? So you would do away with ALL government regulation? Like regulation of oil companies, nuclear plants, automobile safety regulations, etc.?

2706 2018-08-28 18:12:01 So, no.. There hasn't been yet a sanction on oil.. On the other hand in the article you shared, it says that according to some sources vzla is not producing the same as before, and moreover they are siding with Iran in keeping the production levels instead of raising them.
2707 2018-08-28 18:12:00 I’ll oil it myself then mate .

2715 2018-08-28 18:11:09 Girl I think you need like an essential oil. The lavender one specifically. To help you fall asleep. Cos I use it and it works wonders. Since it’s very calming.
2716 2018-08-28 18:11:07 The whole idea of not trusting doctors is insane to me. Until you or a loved one has a disease that HAS to be treated or you die - you will never understand HOW many unethical "doctors" sell snake oil promising cures.
2717 2018-08-28 18:10:55 Valvoline oil change is so theatrical. Man do they put on a show trying to get rubes to spend money they don't need to spend. Never go there without a coupon for $20 or less. They'll fleece ya lol.

2720 2018-08-28 18:10:43 I am technically a young living essential oil distributor. I signed up for all of the fun things you can do with the oils . You can make so many things but me signing up probably added money into someone way ups pocket . I don’t try hard to sell it I just like the oils !

2727 2018-08-28 18:10:06 It’s amazing what golden handshakes will do to politicians. We barely benefit from royalties as citizens bc our gov’t sold us out for handshakes. Oil provides a lot of jobs here in Alberta, and that was exchanged for low royalties, cheap gas for you and rich Alberta politicians

2732 2018-08-28 18:09:59 The reason for that is so that the Venezuelan gov does not re-finance themselves through debt as they have done before. The article says The sanctions fall short of direct penalties on the oil sector, which the Trump adm. said would harm the Venezuelan people & American companies

2739 2018-08-28 18:09:03 It’s actually a chemistry that is more catered toward my major. So specific to the oil companies with that makes sense.

2743 2018-08-28 18:08:27 without major disruptions, we're looking less at changes like "no bitcoins" and more at changes like banning cars, ending all new oil & gas projects & phasing out existing power plants, banning most air conditioning, etc, and yes these are minor disruptions by comparison lmao
2744 2018-08-28 18:07:44 I don’t believe they mix in that can. The small part of the jug says for chain oil only and to not mix with gasoline. That jug is meant to be used with a chainsaw.

2749 2018-08-28 18:07:30 Ok let's try with another example: was it not ok to stop the slaughter of Bosnian Muslims? Or were they only after the enormous reserves of ex-Yugoslav oil?
2750 2018-08-28 18:07:29 This jug of oil said on the bottle that it was for sauteeing and frying. Are they lying to me? This food thing is so complicated.
2751 2018-08-28 18:07:28 Note - picking at a sunburn on your nose looks like you are picking your nose.  Your friends will laugh.  

Correction - I will laugh and then recommend coconut oil for your sunburn.
2752 2018-08-28 18:07:25 Nope I wouldn't want that for you nor did I say that. In some cases yes kratom is good for people but the trend of just telling anyone on the internet to try kratom for this, that, or the other is dangerous. That's like me telling everyone to try CBD oil just because I use it.
2753 2018-08-28 18:07:18 Dude, do you realize there is ZERO the shorts can do to Tesla that it isn't doing to itself? Why aren't shorts this active/vocal about other companies with "green" initiatives? We can't all be big oil shills (though I know Saudi is now your bff)

2756 2018-08-28 18:07:05 You might be a good journalist but you are wrong here. Small helis such as these use JP-4 (fuel) which is even cheaper than Kerosene oil. You should share the truth. :)
2757 2018-08-28 18:07:03 cleanse with Authentic African black soap, use witch hazel after you pat dry and then  moisturize with Aloe vera gel and tea tree oil. both act as antibacterial agents and moisturizers !!

Very useful, but can't remember where I found
2759 2018-08-28 18:06:50 Is there a store called Lush in Pakistan? If you use their lip scrubs and then their lip balm prior to lipstick application, it gives a smooth finish. Almond lip balm is also really good and moisturising, or almond oil in itself overnight

2764 2018-08-28 18:06:24 Watch out for tee tree oil. Use it vary sparingly. It works but it can also be detrimental in the long run and cause more harm than before.

Conservation uses to be something both parties valued. So again; selfishness. No wonder you’re a Republican.

This type of shyster behavior and snake oil con man “performance” (bc that’s what this is) is why so many people get conned into financially supporting ppl like this and it also insults true followers of god and ppl who r decent. #con
2774 2018-08-28 18:05:24 In 1958, A clash between police and striking oil workers leaves several wounded. The government expels forty foreigners accused of inciting the riots.
2775 2018-08-28 18:04:42 The guy’s a snake oil salesman. I can’t think of a single right-wing nut job that strikes me as a genuine “true believer”. They’re all a bunch of con men fleecing the ignorant.

2778 2018-08-28 18:04:36 PM May still trying to sell the snake oil bullshit that making separate UK trade deals is a benefit of leaving the EU. Balls. The deals we make within the EU will be as good or better due to population size of EU. Brexit is madness.

2780 2018-08-28 18:04:27 I’ve been using sunflower oil :-) it helps a lot with redness. It serves as a moisturizer as well but i like to put it on overnight so it can soak in while my skin is regenerating. Sunblock is important but it tends to clog pores as well so it’s tricky
2781 2018-08-28 18:04:23 You are a fool easily swayed by a semi-plausible and emotionally appealing argument.  Snake oil salesman must love you long time?

2812 2018-08-28 18:00:30 To elaborate, at end of 15/16 no one was saying the league is changing & being small & quick is good enough for future.  At end of 16/17 no one said Oil were doomed to crash because NHL changed.  Nor did Oil crash for that reason anyway, as we all know (inj, goal, spec teams).

That's because they cut Iran's oil exports in half& was personally involvedin these diplomatic efforts and pushed them publicly.

2824 2018-08-28 17:59:36 TBI avoid alcohol and *herb*, although the latter issue is being revisited. Some benefits with THC, more with CBD oil, so it’s not uncommon now. Alcohol is still avoided for the initial rehab period. I’ll check MindSpace, they sound familiar.

2828 2018-08-28 17:59:09 yeah, that's what I've been trying to say but this guy is hung up on the fact that Venezuela can't sell oil which is not true. The venezuelan officials can't make transactions offshore (because they're stealing from our national oil company!)

2858 2018-08-28 17:56:12 As far as I know, no sanctions have been emitted to "Venezuela" but to some of the officials, regarding suspicious funds in off shore accounts. Venezuela keeps on selling oil to US, China and the Caribbean.

2875 2018-08-28 17:53:02 And also due to increase in price people will buy less petrol as a result we will import less which will finally effect the oil export of gulf nation . This is a surgical strike on economy of gulf nation .
2876 2018-08-28 17:53:02 Bro, I need you to post this for information of people:

Small helicopters use JP-4 (Fuel) which is even cheaper than Kerosene Oil (Mitti ka tail), so people should stop this fuss about IK traveling in Heli.
2877 2018-08-28 17:53:00 I was yesterday embracing my natural beauty because I love me my hair product grew my hair out it’s amazing !!! Get you some juju juice   !!! A growth oil for fuller more beautiful hair !!!!
2878 2018-08-28 17:52:51 When Duncan Mighty said "If I break your heart, na oil spillage", I felt that..
2879 2018-08-28 17:52:40 @TheGreedyGirl @MarkStuttard Google is failing me, and thought you all might know: If I’m baking a side of salmon (w/lemon, olive oil, garlic) in paper, how do you reckon the paper will affect the bake time?
2880 2018-08-28 17:52:18 This damn oil treatment dripping of my fuckin eyes
2881 2018-08-28 17:52:14 I agree with him that we shouldn’t sell arms to them, but we need their oil. Difficult situation.
2882 2018-08-28 17:52:14 Jee i know rent + driver rent hay
Jo baywakuf log yeh samaj rahay han ky is ka petrol zeada lagata hay
Awal to petrol nai kerosene oil dalta hay
Yani mati ka oil
2883 2018-08-28 17:52:14 The problem isn't thoughtful debate.

The problem is when one side doesn't want to accept and vote for the american public in order to instead vote for something that will just enrich them like oil and gas and ignoring climate change.
2884 2018-08-28 17:52:13 They'll say anything to draw attention away from the fact that it's men with guns who are the problem.
2885 2018-08-28 17:52:08 No one is perfect & we all fall down. It’s how you choose to get back up that counts. I don’t believe anyone should call themselves a Reiki Master until they can naturally put reiki into daily situations for themselves. Practice what U preach.Otherwise, you are selling snake oil.
2886 2018-08-28 17:52:07 Any ladies out there know if coconut oil will rehydrated heat damaged hair or is an oil spilled disaster waiting to happen? 
2887 2018-08-28 17:52:06 Oil rice
2888 2018-08-28 17:52:02 I keep waiting to see a lot of online job ads for "Crude Oil Basis Trader" but nothing so far. #OOTT
2889 2018-08-28 17:51:59 Olive oil breaks down with heat, making it a less healthy fat. Great for salads and such, but the dreaded coconut oil is better for cooking lol
2890 2018-08-28 17:51:55 At the risk of giving @MorenaExterior_ ideas, the energy counter-reform from Hell would be to bring back Article 6 of the Oil Law of 1958, requiring all contracts to go through @Pemex but edited to allow for payment-in-kind and profit-sharing.
2891 2018-08-28 17:51:54 ( ；∀；)
2892 2018-08-28 17:51:47 We returned among the highest No votes in the UK because the snp all but turned its back on Shetland & Orkney in favour of centralisation.  We've endured among the harshest council budget cuts in Scotland in the past 10 years. We're lucky in that we have an oil fund.
2893 2018-08-28 17:51:47 So you don't want to know that until a year ago Wall Street was buying Venezuelan bonds, or that the US never stopped buying Venezuelan oil, or that the economic downslide started in late 2012 when oil was >$100, or that #Bolivia, with a similarly aligned government is doing fine
2894 2018-08-28 17:51:44 Documents ..

The oil minister , Jabbar al-Allaibi , appoints a deputy minister sentenced on charges of corruption and waste of public money, and his competence is not fit for the post.
2895 2018-08-28 17:51:44 Oil lamp?
2896 2018-08-28 17:51:39 Does anyone else hate the term "sticky tape"? Like saying slippery oil. 

While we're at it "tape" is a weird fucking word.
2897 2018-08-28 17:51:34 Tbh China shouldnt be given anything regarding the joint oil exploration but I feel like someday China is going to claim it as theirs just like what they did with scarborough shoal. So instead of getting none just go with the 60/40 and make use of what we have before they take it
2898 2018-08-28 17:51:31 boring Belgian news be like "olive oil price has increased "
2899 2018-08-28 17:51:10 Apparently small helicopters mainly run on JP-4 (Fuel) which is even cheaper than Kerosene Oil. So top this fuss about Imran Khan using a #helicopter and betraying his own austerity claims.

2901 2018-08-28 17:50:52 Some oil under lake Turkana 
2902 2018-08-28 17:50:52 Also acceptable. I ahve discovered olive oil on my popcorn makes zero difference in the taste
2903 2018-08-28 17:50:45 in spite of, not at all because of the NDP and mainly from higher oil prices
2904 2018-08-28 17:50:44 "I was laid off from a big oil company"
"Oh, like Exxon?"
"No... Essential"
2905 2018-08-28 17:50:44 @realDonaldTrump @jaketapper    A sound trade policy?  Trump wants to increase the use of oil, build pipelines. So the pipeline co buys pipe from the company that meets specs. But, they are Greek, and tariffs make the cost too high. Oh well, there is always wind and solar.
2906 2018-08-28 17:50:36 Dem nor born dem well. Lai said the opposition planted the story in @FT. Online herdsmen said because BuBu refused Trumps request for oil.  Being a Buharist is a tough job. It is impossible to defend incompetence.
2907 2018-08-28 17:50:22 Vaca Muerta es, técnicamente, el nombre del yacimiento petrolífero. Lof Campo Maripe es parte del territorio debajo del cual dicho yacimiento de shale oil se encuentra.
No son exactamente la misma cosa.
2908 2018-08-28 17:50:17 Boring irrelevant status update: The general health and well-being of my beard has improved threefold since using beard oil. 
2909 2018-08-28 17:50:15 •always detangle with water based products 
•after detangling, twist or braid up your hair to prevent knots/etc.
•oil is a sealant, so moisturize whole detangling then seal up with oil
•use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your hair to prevent breakage
2910 2018-08-28 17:50:09 Can we also ban executives of oil, gas, and coal companies from taking positions in government of environmental management?
2911 2018-08-28 17:50:08 What's your favorite part of @FPShow? We're excited for snacks at the @Plenish Kitchen - fried in #HighOleic soybean oil!
2912 2018-08-28 17:50:00 I used a little bit of tea tree oil and aloe and then watered it down and that helped with mine 
2913 2018-08-28 17:49:59 It requires jet oil not the one we use in our normal car. Well refined hivh octane gasoline
2914 2018-08-28 17:49:45 Yup, I cheated a little. A mix of olive oil and butter and some garlic salt with onion.
2915 2018-08-28 17:49:44 I have some.  Not silver or gold.  I don't need that.  In fact, the pennies are more interesting because I can imagine some Roman housewife going down to buy her olive oil, or a soldier playing some gambling game.
2916 2018-08-28 17:49:18 Go ahead and shotgun that bottle of olive oil to get nice and lubed up for the hydration SENSATION you’re about to have

2918 2018-08-28 17:49:10 my dear she will never speak on oil price now a days when other party will rule then she will ask to them
2919 2018-08-28 17:49:06 Carter made a serious mistake with the oil crises in the 70s, Iran hostages, and depressing the American spirit! These are 3 biggies!
2920 2018-08-28 17:49:05 Houston’s cost of living will be the biggest difference you see. If you are going to work in the oil industry this IS the city for you. There are MANY oil companies here and they pay decently well. You’ll be able to live on your own easily. Your schedule will suck though.
2921 2018-08-28 17:48:58 Just bought so many oil free products. I am eyelash extension ready 
2922 2018-08-28 17:48:37 god coconut oil really does do amazing things for my hair. idk if it improves the quality of the hair or help protect it or anything but applying some to lower 1/3 or so of my hair length while it's wet after a shower look really nice when it dries

2924 2018-08-28 17:48:16 This reminds me of when President Obama took his family to play at the GOM beach after the oil spill.  You know...because everything is fine here. Oh, and bring money when you come visit.
2925 2018-08-28 17:47:41 Pop some citrus essential oil around the furniture... hopefully she won’t like it and will scratch elsewhere! Check somewhere inconspicuous though, would hate for it to mark anything..... it worked for us!

2929 2018-08-28 17:47:24 The broken side is probably due to shipping, the smoke (depending on color) could be the motor burning off old oil/grease from the previous owner/factory

I personally wouldnt return it unless you find another one in either better condition or get spare parts
2930 2018-08-28 17:47:21 Those so-called rich oil companies are also the keys to our infrastructure, of nothing could be built without said products and byproducts that you depend on every single day. The OLP heavily subsidized green energy projects and look what that got us, future jobs for liberals.
2931 2018-08-28 17:47:19 If they could have waited for some more time keeping the costs low all the oil marketing companies had become Air India .. understand reality don't be childish

If you don't even understand d basic diff btw economy and fx earnings, how can you improve anything?

2935 2018-08-28 17:47:05 Complex is impressive to no out outside of the United States. It’s goal is to kill whoever gets in its way for selling arms, or grabbing oil land.

2938 2018-08-28 17:46:51 I know Max is younger, but I would rub baby oil onto his head and brush it, before washing his hair in cradle cap shampoo when he got dry skin. It cleared up pretty quickly.

2941 2018-08-28 17:46:40 I live in LA and it’s expensive here. I have a good job and still can’t live on my own. Im going places but I don’t love the way my life is going here, like with guys and stuff. I applied to an Oil company in Houston. Why are you thinking about leaving?
2942 2018-08-28 17:46:31 All in the pics :)  oil, cloves, cinnamon, garlic anf ginger.  Fry till garlic golden.. add zeera & onions coik till soft..  add chicken, toasted cumin, salt and turneric.

2943 2018-08-28 17:46:22 Well, a Honda Civic probably won’t have a new oil filter design but a Bugatti probably does. Just guessing.
2944 2018-08-28 17:46:14 The problem isn't so much 'will either work' as neither paradigm can work without cheap, easy-to-get oil. But no one wants talks about that brick wall. Infinite growth is not possible on a finite planet.
2945 2018-08-28 17:45:58 You were so sure of yourself too.  Hey the guy that changed my oil said he just gave Dez Bryant an oil change in Detroit.
2946 2018-08-28 17:45:50 The free education,  the oil blocks, the Government Concession companies, the top political positions, they took it all & left nothing for the youths & they call us lazy even though they had it easy. #PoliticsToday
2947 2018-08-28 17:45:47 Do you know who is going to build the oil refinery and by any chance do you know how that consortium was assembled? M7 was earlier there.
2948 2018-08-28 17:45:41 You keep repeating this meaningless bunkum fed to you by that snake oil merchant that you are yet to understand yourself? Lol. Enjoy
2949 2018-08-28 17:45:33 Idk shit about cars lmao   Just get in and go, drove around without oil from months didn’t know until the whole car was shaking and had about 2,000 dollars worth of damage and drove around on a tire so bad the wires(?) was showing and didn’t know until it went flat 
2950 2018-08-28 17:45:25 On the kill ratio scale Donald has yet to catch up with his predecessors. All presidents are puppets anyway. Trump will be emblematic of the collapse of Dollar/oil matrix and USA becoming a third world country. Like Mexico but full of poor Canadians.
2951 2018-08-28 17:45:22 Martin: So you're agreeing consumers had no market choice and I would argue oil companies had no product supply choice. There was no alternative to gasoline. Suppliers and consumers were locked into a set of technologies with no viable alternatives.
2952 2018-08-28 17:45:21 Has it got oil in the engine 
2953 2018-08-28 17:45:04 When did he say this? Doesn’t he want their oil?
2954 2018-08-28 17:45:00 Want silk-like skin, fast? After a shower, while your skin's still damp, apply olive oil all over your body and pat dry with a damp towel.

2958 2018-08-28 17:43:52 Recall the rows about such nugacities as bananas / olive oil when care was taken to accommodate our interests. Multiply their ferocity by some factor. Consider the more serious issues that could be legislated for in the coming years - finance, tech etc. Add Selmayr. And stir.

2961 2018-08-28 17:43:26 I heard a northern state made 150billion from rice farming. Without restructuring most states are wasting and depending on oil revenue.
2962 2018-08-28 17:43:22 Also it would discourage any new drilling of rigs. I hope the pipeline comes online as soon as possible
2963 2018-08-28 17:43:14 I do it atleast once in two weeks.. I oil my hair 2 hours before I have a shower and wrap my hair from a hot towel.. :)

2969 2018-08-28 17:42:39 Tried pan-frying beans in oil today, with some pasta.

2982 2018-08-28 17:40:23 Nobody forced people to use Standard Oil -- they could ride horses

2988 2018-08-28 17:39:31 I'll get back to you once I've checked - they have odd names, but you can buy preparatory drops from various other wildlife websites for limps and strains - and they all contain arnica. I use this myself for my own dogs. It might even just be the Marmite/oil that helps recovery!
2989 2018-08-28 17:39:30 Well it's 35-40 in the permian, so a $22 spread at a lower price will start to hurt you would think.  I guarantee it's hurting the higher cost producers already
2990 2018-08-28 17:39:30 No just like in yakub Menon case SC will burn the midnight oil
2991 2018-08-28 17:39:20 Economy of South Asia is dependent on agriculture.
Economy of Middle East is dependent on production of oil.
2992 2018-08-28 17:39:05 I can’t stand when people give me shit for working in the oil field industry. Like little do y’all know this ain’t for life. I work 2 JOBS, setting up my future with your 40 year old struggling ass. I don’t have to be here I CHOSE to be here.
2993 2018-08-28 17:38:56 Would this "old leaky pipeline" be safer if the govt hadn't bought it? I support using revenue from oil to help fund the transition and be saved for the future. This seems to be working well for Norway which produces over 3x the oil per capita as Canada
2994 2018-08-28 17:38:51 Deuteronomy 8:8. A land with wheat an barley,Vines an fig trees , pomegranates olive oil and honey.
2995 2018-08-28 17:38:50 You can blame the CEO, but I don't see how it will change anything. The problem imo is they were growing aggressively, like many in the sector, and got caught with this breakdown in oil prices. The only thing that can fix the problems are higher prices.
2996 2018-08-28 17:38:49 They do a bang up job teaching kids in the trades. I know lots of oil burner servicemen who learnt their jobs at MEMA down south in Brunswick. Its alot cheaper than college and it’s a wicked good deal for good paying jobs! Thank you Marty for doing a tweet about this #MEPOLITICS

3002 2018-08-28 17:38:15 Perhaps into time for conservatives to take web technology more seriously and not just obsess about oil and gas. These are the effects of conversations not investing in reaching their constituents online and relying on progressives to share their bandwidth with them for free.
3003 2018-08-28 17:38:08 mystery: why does oatly have oil in it
3004 2018-08-28 17:38:04 Lol yea it depends on the amount of country soda they use.. soda can cause gas.. or maybe your stomach doesnt agree with the red palm oil
3005 2018-08-28 17:37:43 I haven't used any #pesticides in over 40 years - even #organic ones. As I have already said - coconut oil works extremely well for me and there is absolutely no chance whatsoever of it harming any other creatures other than the #pest being targeted.
3006 2018-08-28 17:37:31 ลองคิดหลายๆตลบ
3007 2018-08-28 17:37:29 Hard to believe anything from western media on this. Fort-Russ news reports Chinese Navy is with Iran. Sounds legit and what would happen if you blockade Iran's oil shipments.
3008 2018-08-28 17:37:20 Man I wish I sold my millions of barrels of invisible oil when I had the chance....what am I supposed to do with it now
3009 2018-08-28 17:37:15 Cold rice, break it up with a bit of sesame oil.
3010 2018-08-28 17:37:14 i exfoliate in the shower w johnson’s baby head/to-toe moisture wash and shave with a dry oil of choice! after i get out, i oil down my whole body w johnson’s baby oil while i’m still wet, then add original and newborn baby head to toe lotion on top!!
3011 2018-08-28 17:37:11 can he commission an oil painting of my dog for my apartment?
3012 2018-08-28 17:37:08 when they fuck witcha at the oil change place  #bigdealsbitch
3013 2018-08-28 17:37:03 if yer without a thermometer but have a jar of coconut oil and want to kno how hot it is, there's actually an easy trick:

- hard, solid oil: 65 degrees or below
- malleable, soft oil: - 65-75 degrees
- liquid oil: 75 - 85 degrees 
- gaseous oil: 85 - ITS IN MY MOISTURIZED EYES
3014 2018-08-28 17:36:58 What the hell are you talking about. Badge of death ? If you want to talk death what about the 1st world war. An Imperialist/ capitalist war what about. Iraq despite all the propaganda that was about oil I do not say socalism is the answer to all  things
3015 2018-08-28 17:36:50 Sounds like a nice substitute.  Red sauce, cream sauce or my fav olive oil and black pepper?
3016 2018-08-28 17:36:48 I Was Just Cooking Bacon & Oil Hit My Eye Lid, Smh...
3017 2018-08-28 17:36:48 What do you think would be the cost of production in Permian basin ? I hope the producers don't face insolvency again if EM crisis deepens
3018 2018-08-28 17:36:42 Rubbing a blend of Ylang Ylang, lavender, Bergamot and rose oil on your feet before bed >>>
3019 2018-08-28 17:36:29 I have this thing that I put scented oil into and it disperses into the room I used to use it all the time but it broke a few months ago and I haven’t gotten a new one
3020 2018-08-28 17:36:26 Remember when oil prices were well over $100/barrel and they added a fuel surcharge? Oil has come down but the surcharge is still there. #highskyrobbery
3021 2018-08-28 17:36:20 Also I'm in the oil & gas sector so environment is another topic for another day.
3022 2018-08-28 17:36:18 When last was the oil in the transformer cleaned?
3023 2018-08-28 17:36:18 it’s not that bad girl, the jobs are just high demand here because all of the oil workers and their families are temporary :)
3024 2018-08-28 17:36:12 This is just cool!  I have looked at oil on the ground but never have really seen it until it was brought out in still life before .. Beautiful Capture.
3025 2018-08-28 17:36:08 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
3026 2018-08-28 17:36:06 Oil industry, will create deficits, and every section depending will HV a vicious affect including farming.
And for what to save a few bucks farmers are spending.

It is okay if farmers spend something. What we have to achieve is for them to get fare price for their crops.
3027 2018-08-28 17:35:50 The way Russia has saved #Syria from being invaded by Americans looking for more oil wars and regime changes
3028 2018-08-28 17:35:45 the chicks dig me because I use coconut oil shampoo 
3029 2018-08-28 17:35:19 I still remember the Vauxhall part number for an SD oil filter I left the industry in the late 80s
3030 2018-08-28 17:35:17 I’m honestly impressed by the way the world is handling the United States & #Israel obvious attempts towards creating another Regime change oil war with tax payer money. Macron is correct in reaching out to Putin still would like to see other countries take the lead with #Iran
3031 2018-08-28 17:35:13 Yeah...crazy to think it's been 8 yrs. But it was also a very significant event that you might assume kids had heard of...I think part of it is the oil went away more quickly in the Gulf than in Valdez spill & people think problem solved & life goes on...but recovery is ongoing.
3032 2018-08-28 17:35:09 Can anyone use a FREE container of MCT oil? Message me!
3033 2018-08-28 17:35:07 Exactly!  You sure don't hear about the husband who killed his wife and two beautiful children and put the children in near full oil tankers!  Or last wk in Ut the husband who bludgeoned his wife to death whit crowbar and beat 13 yr daughter to critical condition.  They are white
3034 2018-08-28 17:35:05 @McDonalds why u gotta use beef flavor enhanced oil??? Vegans like fries too #bogus #unnecessary
3035 2018-08-28 17:34:51 Castor oil soaked towel on a heating pad, I lay down on top of it so my weight pressed it against my body more. Then hormones for a few weeks until it either shrinks down or pops 
3036 2018-08-28 17:34:47 Blee. I learned my CBD oil hasn't been shipped yet because the company is swamped filling back orders. So I had been expecting the stuff to arrive at the Rookery maybe Friday or Saturday. Now? Who knows.
3037 2018-08-28 17:34:30 @IntoTheGloss has an article about why you shouldn’t use coconut oil on your face, it’s suuuper thick and clogging!
3038 2018-08-28 17:34:19 Lemonsito, honey, almond oil.... Agwanta! HAHAHA lisod ning style-a HAHAHA
3039 2018-08-28 17:33:57 Why are some square cut and others clawed? Why do some look clunky? She paid $125 for this? This is trash and trashy... with way too much cuticle oil.
3040 2018-08-28 17:33:56 oil.
3041 2018-08-28 17:33:53 Under Carter interest rates got up to 20% he definitely had an influence on the economy allowed Arab oil embargo etc just poor policies which lead to bad economy
3042 2018-08-28 17:33:28 Now you know better than a local who works with the country's most important mangmt school and the central bank. Typical socialist arrogance.
97% of hard currency is from oil exports. Of course, socialists manage that money. Private exports are rare, close to impossible.
3043 2018-08-28 17:33:21 Engineer at oil and gas fields
3044 2018-08-28 17:32:49 Forget sending the illegals back, let’s send all the libs back, the illegals throw great parties and I don’t feel like changing my own oil or mowing my lawn.
3045 2018-08-28 17:32:49 Literally!! 
I love coconut oil, it’s great for my hair too, thank you!
3046 2018-08-28 17:32:45 i really hate the scent “pink pussy” like it’s the worst oil you can buy
3047 2018-08-28 17:32:41 I agree that the quantity is huge but the differential of more than  20$ per barrel is very lucrative as well.
3048 2018-08-28 17:32:39 My own salad dressing that involves just balsamic, olive oil, sea salt, and pepper along with a tablespoon of whatever barbeque sauce is in the fridge. Over spinach. With tomatoes and textured protein seeds or bacon or whatever.
3049 2018-08-28 17:32:37 The oil cos are also HEAVILY invested in renewables. THEY know where the future lies, not this fossil (he doesn't believe in fossils, where did hydrocarbons come from?) TX is now the leader in solar AND wind, but this idiot @tedcruz would rather you not know that.
3050 2018-08-28 17:32:36 I know how to cook. What I don't know is how to cook meat in 2cm of oil. Shit be looking grey and unappetising
3051 2018-08-28 17:32:35 happens everywhere in the world when you rattle a snake
3052 2018-08-28 17:32:34 one time my grandpa pulled my oil checking stick and threw it, he was so mad, lmao. "ain't but a DROP of damn oil in here!"
3053 2018-08-28 17:32:17 When it’s massaged in olive oil and flaky salt it’s a whole new person honestly 
3054 2018-08-28 17:32:16 Don’t feel like going to get this oil change, but gotta go
3055 2018-08-28 17:32:12 Wtf Rich why you gotta drag brussel sprouts through the mud you throw some olive oil salt and pepper on those bad boys you can pop em like grapes. 

...the tweet was bitter though yeah
3056 2018-08-28 17:31:53 A nice Italian sub with oil and vinegar and banana peppers 
3057 2018-08-28 17:31:48 Just got angry imagining that Jamie Oliver is adding olive oil to a dessert somewhere.
3058 2018-08-28 17:31:42 Its fufu & palm oil soup..
3059 2018-08-28 17:31:24 "Your honor, my clients could not have caused the drought because they are in fact rubes who bought snake oil."
3060 2018-08-28 17:31:24 Publix has stopped carrying alternatives to the dressings they include in their salads. All the included dressings contain canola oil. I am going to be horribly ill in about 6 hours, but hey at least I’m not super hungry anymore?

3064 2018-08-28 17:30:44 Finally, learned the car maintenance game. 

Me: Hi, I need an oil change 

Them: Your transmission is about to fall out of the holder. 

Me: (knowing damn well I just got the transmission holder changed) I’ll stick to the oil change. 

Them: ok
3065 2018-08-28 17:30:35 Wish same treatment is given to actors of all religions. Kashmir has huge tourism potential. Just like USA wasted in not exploring own oil reserves and created wars abroad, and realized the mistake now, Kashmiri hardliners are not exploring tourism potential for jobs/better lives
3066 2018-08-28 17:30:34 Can’t we trade with China, oil for solar panels in return? Last time I checked, we don’t manufacture here in

3069 2018-08-28 17:30:18 I smell like motor oil, antifreeze, beard oil, and rum-scented craft soap. It's an odd blend.
3070 2018-08-28 17:29:59 Bigger problem is additional pipeline capacity isn't coming on until year end the earliest.  And remember, Permian produces what over 4 Mil/day in barrels?
3071 2018-08-28 17:29:40 and there are more places like this waiting to be discovered here in Saudi Arabia . It is not a desert and oil only like movies picture it . All thanks to @rashud2
3072 2018-08-28 17:29:37 Treeza needs to loosen up a bit. Bit more oil in the cogs perhaps? Or just a bit more #cheapbooze down her gullet
3073 2018-08-28 17:29:23 But...he hinted at not using the $US for trading in his oil. Therefor, his people had the shit freed outta them and a puppet was inserted in his place to secure US interests. Lovely.
3074 2018-08-28 17:29:14 Have you thought about doing a oil painting of the skull that appears above a skeleton fort?
3075 2018-08-28 17:28:57 Snake oil salesman!
3076 2018-08-28 17:28:56 Everytime I get my oil changed they always gotta do something else too Nini just be taking ALL my money
3077 2018-08-28 17:28:38 OH GOD THE MUDDY OIL CREEPY CRAWLIES. FUCKING POPPIN' OUT OF THE WATER LIKE DAISIES.
3078 2018-08-28 17:28:34 DO NOT worry about temp weight gain. Lots of brocholli with olive oil microwaved bulks you out for 50 kCal and mega tasty too. Dress it with some smoked trout helps too. Best work on axing the social reflex between drinking + smoking. This is the killer issue. #chuffed since 1996
3079 2018-08-28 17:28:12 My car had zero oil in it lol
3080 2018-08-28 17:28:08 3. This person must have been so discrete. Jumped over the fence & break open that oil thing without making a notice. Check the distance between the office & where the fire started. If there's a sign that force was used 2 open it surely people in the office should heard the noise
3081 2018-08-28 17:28:05 Fucking impressive!
3082 2018-08-28 17:28:04 #Trade better not just more. 

Can we ban oil majors like @Shell from flaring #Naturalgas and #polluting the #naijadelta.

Can we ban #opencast mining across @BBGAfrica ... can @CDCgroup start and run a supervised #green #Africanfund not an #exploitative one ?

3083 2018-08-28 17:27:32 We must VOTE conservative or our spot in Oil Production is forever gone. Vote RED
3084 2018-08-28 17:27:26 True. Yet we need equity to fund that. Norway had it's north sea oil.  ME countries have had their oil. We wasted our Bauxite.  We use our exported labour equity for remittances.  Wha wi fi duh?
3085 2018-08-28 17:27:19 Extremely lit
3086 2018-08-28 17:27:04 Prices,int. rates, ,rent prices are, everything funneling into the already fat pockets of the banks, oil companies & landlords (right into the swamp). Middle class (or what's left) not getting raises, will lose their tax cut, health care & social security. #GOPFail
3087 2018-08-28 17:26:57 That video is perfect, Katherine. The absurdity of suggesting that scientists are making any money off climate change defies reason. Feel sorry for the billionaire oil barons who's vast fortunes are so beset by climate change propagating scientists who make hundreds of dollars!
3088 2018-08-28 17:26:52 Generous taxpayers paid for U.K. trip of Devin Nunes.  Chris Steele was not interviewed.  Waste of time. Devin Nunes simply likes to please Donald Trump having been anointed with Trump's anke oil.
3089 2018-08-28 17:26:40 You doing the Keto Diet? MCT oil is even better than coconut milk. Unless it makes you crap your pants. Then I don't suggest the MCT oil.
3090 2018-08-28 17:26:28 I can safely say my opinion could not get any lower of this draft dodging snake oil salesman.

3094 2018-08-28 17:25:46 Are they also subconsciously acknowledging and independent Scotland? Of course not, they don't want to acknowledge us at all just pur oil and falsely accounted exports.....#DissolveTheUnion
3095 2018-08-28 17:25:46 Completely wierd that no short term substitutes have been utilised for getting rid of the problem, is it really difficult to find trucks or rails till the pipelines bottleneck problem is resolved. Baffles me completely
3096 2018-08-28 17:25:42 We should all get royalties from our national resources being exploited.

Why should the oil co's get all the wealth?

If Alaska can pay royalties why can't the federal gov't?
3097 2018-08-28 17:25:32 #Trade better not just more.

3098 2018-08-28 17:25:31 This looks like the guy who walked up to my car window yesterday at Murphy Oil on West Main. My door was locked, I did not roll down the window, and I shook my head “no” at him.
3099 2018-08-28 17:25:24 Hm I was wishing for this oil... enjoy it 
3100 2018-08-28 17:25:22 Has everyone forgotten that Turkey were buying stolen oil off Isis..??
3101 2018-08-28 17:25:20 International laws do not allow such provocative and hatred activities, the world is standing on the throne of the war, the international crisis will work on oil It will use by terrorists the enemy of humanity, for their fascinating purposes.

3106 2018-08-28 17:24:37 If only someone could have thrown hot fry oil on them.
3107 2018-08-28 17:24:30 You that is not even a celeb shebi you ghost your NYSC talkless of Davido and for your info he was in iyana ipaja today for registration.
3108 2018-08-28 17:24:17 There was a 8,000 block sale the other day when no news hit the oil headlines. It was a very long fund unwinding their positioning across the curve.  I’m forecasting a $4-5 intraday drop tomorrow on this 13 million build rumor if it’s true.
3109 2018-08-28 17:24:16 In their dreams.  With nothing but oil money and time on their hands, Islam is trying to take over the world, and they’ve had an 8-year head start with Obama’s help.  Thank God President Trump has turned the tide.
3110 2018-08-28 17:24:05 I think it should be Louisiana Breaux, but I'm honestly for this. He could be a geologist for an oil company.
3111 2018-08-28 17:23:46 We produce bottled 100% CALIFORNIA grown Extra Virgin Olive oil in 2 versions; Rich & Robust & Mild & Delicate which meets all standards set by UC Davis & COOC.  It is thoroughly tested & we have earned the seal of the COOC confirming that it meets the strict standards.
3112 2018-08-28 17:23:37 I've just started taking CBD oil. It works for me. Kinda just makes you not get caught up in over thinking and relaxes you a little. 
3113 2018-08-28 17:23:27 Nothing like ‘em for a little anti-mosquito mood lighting, though! (Assuming you buy the citronella oil, of course)
3114 2018-08-28 17:23:19 The headline of the evening would be: 'Evangelicals remain enthusiastically supportive of con man, snake oil salesmen, who has paid off porn stars and Playmates, and had a kid with his cleaning lady President’.
3115 2018-08-28 17:23:16 The oil and shi.. I'm disgusted 
3116 2018-08-28 17:23:15 4 Oil paintings :

3121 2018-08-28 17:21:56 Nothing like going to grandpa’s for a free oil change and verbal abuse
3122 2018-08-28 17:21:54 The lack of confidence has nothing to do with Venezuela's problems. They have massive oil reserves. More like US trade sanctions and a cold war.

3124 2018-08-28 17:21:51 There are huge advantages of Electric vehicles.Oil import bill of countries will go down. Most of the oil rich countries Arab/Russia/etc only spread terrorism in world in the name of independence and religious movements. Afghan, Syrian and African chaos are oil politics created

3127 2018-08-28 17:21:15 y'all need to understand the oil extracted from trinidad is exported, the oil refined in trinidad is imported. the upstream/downstream industry was in need of an overhaul looong time
3128 2018-08-28 17:21:04 Once Aleve worked for me, but only once! Advil is my go-to but I ran out. Peppermint oil...yes, my grandmother always had a chinese oil, name translated to white flower oil for exactly this (and other ailments) it’s so good! Next time I’m in Chinatown I’ll get you one! Minty oil!
3129 2018-08-28 17:20:44 I need my nails done but I need my oil changed..

3135 2018-08-28 17:20:13 It looks like they’re trying to coax a rogue robot back in to the van! Possibly using a can of oil and some micro chips?
3136 2018-08-28 17:20:09 Of course he’d say that as he had no clue. Remember when he went on national tv saying we were at the brink of disaster and running out of oil ? We only had a few years left if I recall. Then, no more oil.
3137 2018-08-28 17:19:52 Cracked Sicilian Olives were made at Bella Roma today!  Green olives are cracked and then mixed together with crushed red pepper, garlic, oregano, celery and olive oil 
3138 2018-08-28 17:19:48 Nothing topically, but you can buy various homeopathic oral drops from Dene's Animal Health & I'm using a combination as suggested by a reputable wildlife website. Can't remember which ones right now, but it's administered on a tiny square of bread with Marmite/cod liver oil on!
3139 2018-08-28 17:19:35 You still haven’t produced a video verifying your claims. And since when is it illegal or immoral to sell fish oil? Beats selling commercial time to pharmaceutical companies for antidepressants and viagra.
3140 2018-08-28 17:19:28 2. From the footage it's clear the fire had just started. Those stations are fenced & locked meaning one has to jump in & out or break the gate lock. How much tym did this person have 2 jump over the fence, break open that oil thing, start a fire & jump out unnoticed? 60 seconds?
3141 2018-08-28 17:19:07 Cheaper is clearly good. Unalloyed good. But... the best batteries we have are a long, long way from the energy density of oil. 7 pounds of petroleum will push a damned Humvee over hill and dale for 13 miles, at 60 mph. I'm not arguing against batteries... I do like to breathe.

3145 2018-08-28 17:18:51 Do you have a dispensary where you live? I get mine from there. My dog has epilepsy and for 3 weeks a 2 days while on the CBD oil has had Zero seizures. So thankful for that stuff!
3146 2018-08-28 17:18:39 WHAT are you talking about? He’s a conman, a snake oil salesman who has paid off hookers and Playmates, had a kid with his cleaning woman, separated and locked up kids of immigrants, has alienated Canada, Mexico, NATO, the EU, China and American farmers! Liars!
3147 2018-08-28 17:18:33 It is possible actually. Just that the method has to be refined. Like you cover the wet dough with flour, dip it in oil then the air fryer. Problem is controlling the heat. You get that right you good. 

I don't u/stand how you can't see this.
3148 2018-08-28 17:18:31 HAHAHAHAHAHA The man sitting on top some of the largest oil deposits wants America to be off of fossil fuel? HAHAHA  I think you need to check your medication.  Also again, just because someone says that would be great, doesn't mean they mean it or are taking any steps to do it.
3149 2018-08-28 17:18:19 Is it weird that I kinda want to print out @davegershgorn's olive oil piece so that I can read it on a plane sometime instead of leaving it in my tabs for months?
3150 2018-08-28 17:18:06 I’ll really be damned lmao. I mean in my city we be having McDonald’s and shit built into gas stations so I can see it, but I ain’t eating no where you can buy engine oil fam.
3151 2018-08-28 17:18:03 Doesn’t solve the problem for oil and gas industry who wants to monitor their assets (Pipelines) through drone surveillance. Please consider relaxation on visual line of sight clause. Regards. @dpradhanbjp @narendramodi @PiyushGoyal
3152 2018-08-28 17:17:46 @realDonaldTrump The action group against Iran has its duty to change the regime in Iran, and we support this group. No country has the right to trade with Iran, and Iran's oil exports will reach zero.
3153 2018-08-28 17:17:46 I wasn't really being serious my point was CBD oil is in Oculus there's no reason for them to regulate it. I feel like misplaced morality and greed have something to do with it as well. It's ridiculous to regulate CBD oil just ridiculous...
3154 2018-08-28 17:17:35 There's always CBD oil capsules.
3155 2018-08-28 17:17:32 Like naturally or with western medicine because I mean just take Tylenol but naturally drink cool water. I will say a fever is your bodies natural response to killing something so you might want to wait and asses your symptoms. Also try to incorporate coconut oil into something.
3156 2018-08-28 17:17:13 And by the way, white privilege and white guilt are the same con religious types use to gain control and power. They call it original sin, a non-existent disease for only they have the cure. We see through this snake oil.

3167 2018-08-28 17:16:09 also - eggs.  avocado.  cream cheese.  and look into MCT oil.  :)
3168 2018-08-28 17:16:05 Slept like a baby last night and idk if it was the CBD Oil that helped me without having to wake up in the middle of night
3169 2018-08-28 17:15:54 I fucking poured oil down my sink like a duck about a week ago.... my whole kitchen just overflowed lol
3170 2018-08-28 17:15:45 Wasting his time, they mix on course like oil and water.
3171 2018-08-28 17:15:44 People said the planet was 'running out of energy' 30 years ago and they were wrong. US has more oil reserves than any country in the world now. The long-view is good, you just are being lied to.

3175 2018-08-28 17:15:15 Get bio oil and start using it right away and continue after baby arrives. I’ll get you some and give it to you at the weekend but you need to keep up with using it  xx ask Khalifa to pick up the cake

3177 2018-08-28 17:15:00 My main point actually which I would welcome feedback is the Oil issue, which was a huge part of the SNP justification for the economic resilience of Scotland. In the interim Oil dropped from ~£110 barrel at the time of the ref to ~£27 in 2016

3180 2018-08-28 17:14:50 dude you should get some kava or CBD oil it helps alleviate nervous and anxious feelings. it’ll put you in a calm state. ofc this isn’t the only solution because everyone’s bodies and minds react to things differently but remember to breathe

3182 2018-08-28 17:14:30 What kind of oil gets used in these scenes
3183 2018-08-28 17:14:30 True. My dad has probably only replaced 3 oil burners in all his years. We now have a situation where newly passed @OFTEC engineers replace whole burners because they can not fault find eg a solinoid. People I've met in OFTEC are fantastic. But most competencey schemes fail.
3184 2018-08-28 17:14:28 Am I the only one who pays no more than $40 at @Nissan to get my oil change ? And they rotate my tires.

3191 2018-08-28 17:12:52 Usually sugar and oil - not always peanut oil.
3192 2018-08-28 17:12:47 Some change in Manchester, City are turning into Utd while Utd are turning into City when they were a banter club before the oil money arrived
3193 2018-08-28 17:12:41 The problem is he just brings some facts.  Might be 2nd lowest debt/Gdp, but it grew steadily under Wall, along with debt per capita, even during high oil prices.
3194 2018-08-28 17:12:35 I have primed all the pieces of the new dollhouse. Wow, that was a lot of work. Hot tip: olive oil is a solvent for resinous and solvent based paints, even synthetic resins and alkyds. Clean up your hands with EVOO.

3198 2018-08-28 17:12:09 I suppose it’s worth a shot. But I found anything with oil in it makes it worse. In the midst of a horrible break out I actually can’t put anything on my face at all because it inflames it more? I guess my skin gets so irritated product just makes it worse.
3199 2018-08-28 17:12:07 "... Thank you Doctor Ziegler. I'll try to remember all that." 

He purses his lips. His hands go back and forth over a dirty oil stained cloth.
3200 2018-08-28 17:12:04 Was it paid with our oil money, like the M25 and the channel tunnel ?
3201 2018-08-28 17:12:02 Wages are increasing, the chart shows that inflation is slightly outpacing it. However numbers out today. Oil price and housing prices down/slowed show that trend could be changing
3202 2018-08-28 17:11:55 Hmm idk they said it was palm oil soup..
3203 2018-08-28 17:11:47 I was once scammed in a French service station. A helpful chap asked if he could check the oil level. “Oui ” said I, “Demi litre” said he. “Ca va” said I and demi litre was duly poured. I was then charged for a 5l can so ended up with 4.5l of surplus oil. Entente Cordiale not.
3204 2018-08-28 17:11:44 I think the reason why the white guy got more attention is because he absolutely MURDERED them and buried them on an oil site but the other guy in defense against his own kid beat a guy for it and because its a less big story than the other they just spent less time on it

3206 2018-08-28 17:11:36 yes because the outstanding dues of UPA time to oil suppliers like Iran were paid by this gov. in USD. and $ is appreciated against all the currencies, not just INR, other than yen.

3226 2018-08-28 17:08:12 shale oil still needs to be burned to generate usable energy while wind/solar just generated the usable energy directly. Shouldn't this be factored into your analysis?
3227 2018-08-28 17:08:08 Being honest, what products are priced significantly up on ? Home prices have slowed, milk prices is down, oil has dropped again. I’m honestly not seeing it. Maybe it’s Northeast Ohio But I just don’t know

3253 2018-08-28 17:04:37 How can that be remotely right? The highest ever national production was 229,527 bopd in 1978 and most of that oil then was being produced by Amoco. It's yet another piece of misinformation.
3254 2018-08-28 17:04:35 True, missed that. I would also head in the opposite direction too, the transformer is leaking a lot of oil and close to the fire. The possibility of an explosion is great. He should have called for help immediately though.

3265 2018-08-28 17:03:06 May be time to do a Standard Oil, Ma Bell.
3266 2018-08-28 17:03:00 We don't deal with coal here in Texas, we deal in Oil and natural gas. Solar can work along side of the Oil and gas industry producing it's own products. It just can't compete because it can't do the things that Oil and gas can do.
3267 2018-08-28 17:02:57 Cooking with coconut oil has been a tradition in my family. My maternal grandmother lived till 81 & my paternal one is still alive & thriving at 80. I'm more worried about other habits imported from America like Marlboros & McDonalds that will prevent me from living a long life.
3268 2018-08-28 17:02:54 Girl im out here lookin for a nigga to oil my scalp from time to time
3269 2018-08-28 17:02:37 I have very curly hair (and dry).  A few months ago I started using coconut oil on damp hair and then seal it with As I Am double butter cream.  My hair is so much better now.
3270 2018-08-28 17:02:17 I put oil in it. That’s enough, surely?!
3271 2018-08-28 17:02:17 I’ve found this homemade soap a lady makes in my hometown and that with coffee oil to moisturize after washing has helped my acne so much! (I also have hypothyroidism and break outs are horrible). It’s old fashioned tub soap maybe you could find similar on Etsy?
3272 2018-08-28 17:02:13 the guy films for a few seconds  before shouting 'fire'. How was the gate left open? Who opened the transformer to release the oil. Where were these employees that they saw and heard nothing?

3277 2018-08-28 17:01:44 You're both right talking about the Permian. Chart, however, is all tight oil including BK, EF, NIOB, GW ML & PERM. PERM dominates the RC at about 70% of total rigs but Perm RC has inc +7 since  early Jun while BK, EF, etc are all down. Problem is bigger than Permian take-away.

3280 2018-08-28 17:01:34 @tinfoilhatpod you guys should look into how the oil companies basically destroyed Nuclear energy in this country! We could have been off fossil fuels decades ago plus it could have kept the greenhouse effect down. They turned nuclear into something way more scary then it is.

3291 2018-08-28 16:59:42 The huge irony is that I'm actually a content creator.
Not in a Twitter or Facebook sense, but in my actual work.
Social media is just a passing fad, something for a robot to do on one of the 10 tea, coffee or oil breaks of the day... 
3292 2018-08-28 16:59:29 There was a multi dollar run up before that sell off. That’s why. If the rumors floating around in the oil industry today are true for EIA REPORT tomorrow I think we will see similar to 2015 sell offs soon.

3308 2018-08-28 16:56:51 My Dad is an influencer it would seem. He was definitely using coconut oil before every shop in Britain had a shelf dedicated to it as well.
3309 2018-08-28 16:56:50 I lost a pound quite easily, I had a hole in my pocket  But I'm not stupid enough to pay £200 per month to lose 8 pounds (lbs) it is snake oil

3314 2018-08-28 16:55:37 2050 compared to 2005. The Paris climate agreement includes all national flights. We expect a transition in fuel and in planes. First the use of advanced sus aviation fuel i.e. based on used cooking oil, later on synthetic kerosene. Electric planes are currently being developed,
3315 2018-08-28 16:55:32 Living under Isis is worse than Saddam  . Sex slaves & beheadings and crucified Christians and children . Tell me you would prefer Isis to Saddam Mark !  And how many USA soldiers had to die and how many children died during the war for oil ?
3316 2018-08-28 16:55:31 I've never REALLY considered myself a full adult, but I'm currently having a conversation about fracking and oil and gas prices so I mean, time to retire and take up knitting I guess

3324 2018-08-28 16:54:26 The concentration of this drop in Alberta suggests it reflects the fall in incomes related to low oil prices in 2016, not a general response of high-income Canadians to the modestly higher top federal tax rate. #cdnecon
3325 2018-08-28 16:54:19 It’s true— I was thinking that coconut oil is something that Africans and Caribbean folk have been using forever for a variety of uses— now they are wanting to come for it 
3326 2018-08-28 16:54:11 Never trust the GOP with your healthcare. They are in the pocket of the ins industry, medical industry, chemical industry, oil industry, etc. Not the party of the people.
3327 2018-08-28 16:54:06 Twitter full of shitty posts from Oil fans.  Not just negative takes.  Today I see guy post "why McD really wants to score more" as caption to photo of Cag.   WTF is that, other than being an a-hole?  Too much of this & its over & over & calling out as tired and tacky is fine.

3342 2018-08-28 16:52:30 #DGOC up 1.9% and perhaps it's turning up again. It certainly seems cheap enough as long as Oil Price stays up.

3351 2018-08-28 16:51:30 Yes you are right. So many people die so that others make money. Clinton got impeached because he had an affair w an intern! But Bush who sent young US soldiers to die for oil with a lie has all the honors and got re-elected. Wonder who interferes w elections.

3353 2018-08-28 16:51:25 How much of this is due to Yemen's oil reserves, and the mad push to extract the wealth of an already poor nation?

3362 2018-08-28 16:50:47 Tea tree oil. A few dabs on the skin works for me. It's effective, but if you're too liberal with it, you can end up smelling like a tea bag!
3363 2018-08-28 16:50:34 It's not 'possible' war crimes. It's obvious war crimes orchestrated by Trump, Saudi Arabia, U.A.E. and their inhumane oil greed. If ever there was a time for the UN to grow some balls and stand up for humanity, it's NOW. Don't be cowards. Thank you.
3364 2018-08-28 16:50:33 No silly. The oil markets are fine. Abandoning pipelines, creating uncertainty with a Royalty Review that drove billions of investment out of the Province. 

Your narrative on markets can't work in Canada and not affect anywhere else. Basic economics
3365 2018-08-28 16:50:32 Do you have any specifics about the new "trade agreement"? I forsee this being just like the NK thing... no details...no facts...just photo ops and smokescreens. But at least we know that @GOP is just another arm of the @realDonaldTrump snake oil sales team. Time to #droptheG

3377 2018-08-28 16:48:41 The "Russia bashing" is probably warranted. Where there is smoke there is fire. All of this revolves around money and power. Oil, gas, currencies, etc. Corruption is at a global scale. The strategies for continuing war has changed.
3378 2018-08-28 16:48:40 The new scientific report about #climate impacts in California gives @JerryBrownGov all the ammo he needs to stand up to Big Oil and end all new fossil fuel projects in the state. Time for him to walk the talk. #BrownsLastChance #FossilFree #GCAS2018 #RiseForClimate

3382 2018-08-28 16:48:16 Laugh all you want, but taxes were higher under the bulk of Klein. Then in 2002 when oil spiked, he lowered taxes everywhere else. Now we can't afford anything because oil is no longer at 100/bbl. Lowest taxed district in North America.

3405 2018-08-28 16:45:57 Because they calculate data differently Canada adds in monies earned from re-exports which aren’t covered in NAFTA. Then there is the argument of services legal, tourism yadda yadda and how that’s calculated. natural resources Electricity Oil Uranium US is reliant upon.

The only reason we have oily/combo skin is because our face is actually dry and produces an excessive amount of oil which makes us oily .. I used the farsali oil and then use rimmel matte primer

3424 2018-08-28 16:43:43 Why, pray tell, would anyone be jealous of this snake oil salesmodel?
3425 2018-08-28 16:43:43 Yeah I hate those people. That’s why I judge restaurants purely on if the maple syrup resembles motor oil.
3426 2018-08-28 16:43:43 Oil rich? youre thinking about 80s Venezuela. The govt has driven the oil economy to its ruins so, no, i dont think the sanctions fuel poverty in the country. Because what they do is stop the govt officials to steal like the’ve been doing while pretending they care about the poor
3427 2018-08-28 16:43:38 Milly too rock oil and flour.

3434 2018-08-28 16:42:55 Castor oil
3435 2018-08-28 16:42:39 Well said :) I'll add that red wine vinegar is also indispensable for the dressing, and that only extra virgin olive oil will do. I always use peppers and often add purslane to the mix too :)
3436 2018-08-28 16:42:02 Break it up like AT&T and Standard Oil. They never abused the public's trust to the degree Google has.
3437 2018-08-28 16:41:47 Maybe they could break Google up like Standard Oil so that people in Florida and New York would have to use different search engines.
3438 2018-08-28 16:41:40 Oil (=/+): US oil inventories probably slid 1.49m barrels last week - Bberg survey, in what would be a second straight drop for stockpiles

3444 2018-08-28 16:41:04 Where’s the baby oil? 
3445 2018-08-28 16:40:59 whatever happened to the musical era where a band would go "let's make an album that's the aural version of tasting a chasm" and then record it all through an oil drum
3446 2018-08-28 16:40:57 I don't know if I've had a meal as good as a pile of cafeteria curly fries still sopping with oil dunked in a pile of ketchup and eaten in about 2 minutes
3447 2018-08-28 16:40:55 Agree Jessica. IMO, international (and to some extent domestic) movement of money, & what it funds, often includes oil as part of the equation. Control of world's oil = power
3448 2018-08-28 16:40:51 Haaaaah getting my oil changed gives me anxiety bc why not?
3449 2018-08-28 16:40:46 This is the same Inhoffe who threw a snowball on the Senate floor, after stuffing his pockets with oil company graft. What a gem.
3450 2018-08-28 16:40:46 They aren't working for the voters. They obey their donors, big oil, pharm,NRA, Putin, health companies, insurance, and billionaires, etc.

3452 2018-08-28 16:40:38 Brown missed his wake up call to #StopFracking and #ShutItAllDown. What part of “urgent” says protect oil refinery business models?

3456 2018-08-28 16:40:17 Trudeau making sure Eastern Canada will be dependent on Saudi oil for a very long time when he nixed Energy East pipeline to move oil from Alberta to eastern Canada.

3459 2018-08-28 16:40:03 Lol it says Aramco, the company that exports all Saudi oil, produces 10 billion barrels a day. It’s headquarters just happens to be in Dharan. No where does it say Dharan itself produces more oil than 3.5 billion bpd
3460 2018-08-28 16:39:57 I just used coconut oil on my hair, this is amazing

3465 2018-08-28 16:39:14 Gas, diesel, petrol, all are burning holes in people's pocket not because world oil prices are high but because govt has decided to recover the bank losses by imposing one of the highest tax rates on fuel.

3468 2018-08-28 16:39:03 We have funded this "Nordic model" for 50 years with vast amounts of oil money. The peak has been reached (even politicians freely admit this), public over-expenditure is no secret, the state has grown to abnormal proportions, everything is taxed to death, and industry is dying.
3469 2018-08-28 16:39:01 Its quite healthy, just needs to be prepared with less oil.
3470 2018-08-28 16:39:00 What do you do with sunflower oil?!?
It can be used anytime you would use an oil- in salad dressings, making popcorn, and in baking & sauteing! 
Look for this Kansas grown & made sunflower oil to add to your cooking-"It's the healthiest oil, made in the healthiest way."
3471 2018-08-28 16:38:49 Nope, I buy myself from Forte Oil.
3472 2018-08-28 16:38:41 It's a good thing that no one in oil and gas trading (not sure about electricity or sulfer traders though) would ever have to worry about it due to industry professionalism and vast intellectual capital as well as being one of the "Four Pillars of Society" #OOTT

3481 2018-08-28 16:38:04 Nothing a stronger USD, higher rates & a 60% collapse in US oil exports in the past 9 weeks can't fix... :/
3482 2018-08-28 16:37:59 Typical Democrat stupidity. Don't fix anything just change who pays. If the cost of gas went up as fast as a college indoctrination Chuck & the rest of the useless Dem prty would have every oil industry CEO testifying in front of Congress. Colleges get away it with no Dem outrage
3483 2018-08-28 16:37:52 I know ginger root, lemon, honey and ACV  is good for colds when u make tea with it. Peppermint oil can be used to open sinuses when inhaled. Peppermint, frankincense and lavender oils can also be used on the skin for headaches, muscle aches and things of that nature.

At 1.8% of GHG's we make NO diff to climate,  As USA, India, China, Russia move from fossil fuel, so will we. Until then all we are depriving ourselves of the $$ to make transition feasible.
3502 2018-08-28 16:35:57 Made some honey avocado coconut oil hair smoothie, infused with sage, rosemary, and mint. Gonna take it for a spin today.
3503 2018-08-28 16:35:49 Yup yup yup, and it’s in nearly everything. There’s like 40 different chemical names that are basically coconut oil. It’s so difficult to find any face products that I can use.
3504 2018-08-28 16:35:43 No the garages down there and cars all over the place parked on single yellow lines one burned out car oil and debris all over the little bit of paving that can be accessed it really is a disgusting area.

3512 2018-08-28 16:34:22 On 27 May 2014, Indian Basket Crude was $106.85/barrel and Diesel price in Delhi was ₹56.71 and petrol price was ₹71.41.

Today, on 28 Aug 2018, when Crude Oil is 31.56% cheaper, petrol is 9.1% and Diesel is 22.48% costlier!

3521 2018-08-28 16:33:08 Im fine with paying a little more if it means we are trying to reduce our effect on the environment. Yes there shouldn’t be subsidies for oil but it’s here and we need to incentivize EVs to speed the transition away from it. Mass production will drop the price of EVs dramatically

I was actually afraid to use products containing it for ages because I have such large pores and am prone to blackheads, but Kopari’s products work wonders for me.

3531 2018-08-28 16:31:51 I’m sitting at the car dealership waiting on an oil change and watching these salesmen try to hustle all the people waiting on services with older cars into purchasing new ones.
3532 2018-08-28 16:31:29 @CBDAmericanSh Hi. Do u have stores in Houston, TX? I need to buy some CBD oil
3533 2018-08-28 16:31:29 Sex complements or supplements.
It's like rice and beans.
When u say free sex it's like "Hey u come let me oil u up" then off she goes after that
3534 2018-08-28 16:31:19 Trinidad run out of oil?

3536 2018-08-28 16:30:49 TR Oil Research forecast crude inventories increased by 2.8 million barrels for the week ending August 24th, 2018.
3537 2018-08-28 16:30:48 WTI oil at $68.91/barrel, near unchanged.
3538 2018-08-28 16:30:48 I'll be right over! Bringing over more tomatoes from our garden. And a zucchini. Oh I'll mix up some homemade dipping oil too for fresh bread n cheese noms
3539 2018-08-28 16:30:46 Normally
3540 2018-08-28 16:30:42 Capitalism without government intervention is why medical care is too expensive in America. Is why oil companies have scored trillions at the expense of the environment. Is why Yemeni children are being killed in their school bus. Capitalism creates the power. #AssGasOrGrass
3541 2018-08-28 16:30:42 Putting some oil in my car, then heading up near Cameron around highway 36 to set up for tonight's severe weather!

3543 2018-08-28 16:30:30 Canadian who doesn’t care about Trump. We have all the resources, oil, lumber, minerals, water and agriculture. All this with only 35 million people. We’ll be fine without Trump trade agreement. China Europe are waiting.

3546 2018-08-28 16:30:17 Ollie opens the doors to the station. It's much quieter than before. Many of the officers have gone home to make way for the night shift. But the lead detective is still there, burning the midnight oil. "Officer, we have a lead. This is Henry Fields. He has information."
3547 2018-08-28 16:30:14 Do you know why wrestlers apply oil on their body?  So that they can't be grabbed by the opponent. Some dacoits from Maharashtra also apply oil on their body so they cannot be apprehended by people. Sharad Pawar is one such dacoit.
3548 2018-08-28 16:30:12 Lavender in some sort of oil or rub? Works for me. And you have to love corn on the cob, smeared in butter 
3549 2018-08-28 16:30:10 Medical marijuana is essential oil for hippies.
3550 2018-08-28 16:29:55 This is good news.
Concidering the current Ontario government is owned by oil companies.
3551 2018-08-28 16:29:45 TJ Maxx is such a dangerous place. Came here to buy lemon essential oil and now I'm in the kitchen aisle looking at avocado pods
3552 2018-08-28 16:29:38 I DO &and so does the #RUMPUK Government
Which is why they are shit scared of us going
International credit rating will tank without Oil money; the cost of servicing their ever growing DEBT will rocket, and what will they do surrounded by #EU Nation on all sides
3553 2018-08-28 16:29:27 Tracy, do you know that the US production of oil is greater than the Middle East?  But we use more so we have to import.  Just think what electric car would do to economy!
3554 2018-08-28 16:29:25 That is a oil refinery war.
3555 2018-08-28 16:29:20 #NatureMadeProbiotics #Sweepstakes Love @NatureMade flaxseed oil!
3556 2018-08-28 16:29:13 Fucking oil change $80 like wtf
3557 2018-08-28 16:29:12 I have often thought that handfuls of families are wealthy from the coal, oil, and gas reserves in the US, when in actuality those deposits belong to all of us.
3558 2018-08-28 16:28:48 Habis cuci muka, terus dipakein olive oil, enak wanginya. Berasap bersih dari dosa-dosa.
3559 2018-08-28 16:28:47 @MichaKobs Thanks, that's a good reference. Without counting the pixels, and if continuous variable data isn't buffered, it looks like a new oil temperature sample was very close to be written. So a discrete measurement at the "top" of the blue line and straight lines per 64sec?
3560 2018-08-28 16:28:40 I’m just going to have to accept that every single clothing item I will ever own will have a minimum of 1 oil spot. Forever. Till the end of time.
3561 2018-08-28 16:28:34 All that stuff probably smells like sour cream and motor oil
3562 2018-08-28 16:28:24 Since oil drilling in the Albertine Graben started tourist levels went down. Counter arrests of @kizzabesigye1 and killing of #Ugandans in demos by @PoliceUg reduced the number of tourists coming. Now @HEBobiwine and #Arua33 were arrested and tortured. Until @GovUganda wakes up.

3565 2018-08-28 16:28:15 Engine Oil toh next generation par chhod dena hai - maybe after 70 years 
3566 2018-08-28 16:28:12 Mexico has massive oil reserves that could be tapped and would really strengthen North America; one example that is a win for both countries
3567 2018-08-28 16:28:00 A transformer holds over 3000l of oil.... there's a risk of explosion what will a mere fire extinguisher help
3568 2018-08-28 16:27:53 I'm sick of the same old run of the mill washing powder / detergent, cooking oil ads 
3569 2018-08-28 16:27:47 I am only outraged because your government is not pursuing Energy East pipeline and would rather buy high priced foreign oil.   Smart move is buy Canadian.  Create jobs.   End reliance on unethical oil.  Then focus on enviro projects.  We are already way ahead of other nations.
3570 2018-08-28 16:27:30 Gas, diesel, petrol, all are burning holes in people's pocket not because world oil prices are high but because govt has decided to recover the bank losses by imposing one of the highest tax rates on fuel.
#PiratesOfGDP
3571 2018-08-28 16:27:28 It is good to note that the policy to diversify is achieving good record...worth knowing that d decline is basically on d oil sector..while gdp grew on d non oil sector that is a good pointer that soon d economy will regain it position
3572 2018-08-28 16:27:25 Have you ever had your pool thermometer break? Don’t worry, the liquid is not harmful! Most thermometer manufacturers use a vegetable oil, which is dyed red and responds to temperature the same way that mercury does. This oil is non-toxic.
3573 2018-08-28 16:27:24 Gas, diesel, petrol, all are burning holes in people's pocket not because world oil prices are high but because govt has decided to recover the bank losses by imposing one of the highest tax rates on fuel.

3575 2018-08-28 16:27:18 As oil runs out, Western vultures turn their eyes to minerals…
3576 2018-08-28 16:27:11 Shouldn't have made that public, now Trump will send in oil rigs.
3577 2018-08-28 16:26:54 If the technology of the 'Green industry movement' actually is the wave of the future, than there shouldn't be any problem by that time. I don't think the Green movement is even looking at replacing Oil and gas, otherwise they would already have alternatives for Jet fuel..etc.
3578 2018-08-28 16:26:53 I am only outraged because your government is not pursuing Energy East pipeline and would rather buy high priced foreign oil.   Smart move is buy Canadian.  Create jobs.

3580 2018-08-28 16:26:46 Perfect Republican move. Deregulate banks, oil company's, coal, and any other industry that puts money in their pocket with no trickle down. BUT they'll regulate Google once again to their advantage. Against Constitution. Fuck the Gop and dictator  trump
3581 2018-08-28 16:26:44 Someone get the Tin Woman some oil before she starts to rust.
3582 2018-08-28 16:26:42 Drove through motorway toll Naples just before Saturday midnight in December ‘73. Didn’t understand the warning about no driving on Sunday due to Oil Crisis.
Continued driving for hours on eerily deserted highway.
They haven’t caught me yet!
3583 2018-08-28 16:26:40 Try a better quality, in Olive oil, add salt & pepper and you could be pleasantly surprised.
3584 2018-08-28 16:26:35 When you advocated stealing Libya's oil was funnier than both.
3585 2018-08-28 16:26:32 ต้องโดนทำโทษมั้ย?
3586 2018-08-28 16:25:58 @HRHLou How's your Mom's knee. Maybe the CBD oil is helping me, I went up and down the stairs without an issue in the knees.
3587 2018-08-28 16:25:56 Add oil and looking forward to habe u back in liverpool
3588 2018-08-28 16:25:52 We may hv a dentist for a president! But here’s the upside- we can invoke his Hippocratic oath to save lives and grant death penalty pardons
3589 2018-08-28 16:25:49 The book is so full of thiccbigdick energy, we won't need to use oil ever again.
3590 2018-08-28 16:25:43 FUCK!!
Another oil leak!!
3591 2018-08-28 16:25:40 ALSO, make a pre-poo with COLD PRESSED castor oil. It smells strong & it’s hella thick, but not unbearable.
3592 2018-08-28 16:25:35 Date, wee bit of organic coco powder, wee drop coconut oil blend all together til sticky and smooth, crush nuts add into mix put in fridge 1
3593 2018-08-28 16:25:34 Oil supplies to vehicles will be blocked in near future if they don't put a photo of Usesco certified PM
Meanwhile oil prices are crossing all the levels same as modi crosses all the level of shame

3598 2018-08-28 16:24:17 I tried some oil but maybe I just need to put more on it. Would provide some comic relief.
3599 2018-08-28 16:24:17 my car needs a damn oil change already
3600 2018-08-28 16:24:15 But guys why is TM limiting cooking oil its now 3 x 2ltres per day , what if ndinemabiko mmm kut pfeee kuchatiparira

3603 2018-08-28 16:23:48 "We don't have to worry about accuracy or context in our comedy book because it's comedy!" isn't actually true when the purpose of your entire brand is to convert people to believing what you do. Snake oil salesmen might change their looks, but never their moves.
3604 2018-08-28 16:23:37 He will probably re-employ himself after his service year .
Extremely madtt
3605 2018-08-28 16:23:17 Some kind of speed limit will mitigate delays but issues will still arise. Rubberneckers will still run into rear of someone else. There might be oil/hazards on the carriageway.

The quicker they build the Tilbury crossing the better. At least will have two bridges to queue at 
3606 2018-08-28 16:23:11 Pharmaceutical marijuana? Why does that throw up red flags for me? Pills or oil only? Patents & big phama!!! Cha-Ching!
3607 2018-08-28 16:22:59 We work with the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil to certify and strictly monitor production.

3611 2018-08-28 16:22:27 Ya sorry it is so beat up. It's 25 years old and I didn't frame it until a few years ago. Re your pain: do you take fish oil? Glucosamine? Magnesium? LMK if you want some help with that stuff. It can reduce inflammation/pain. Great to hear from you.

3613 2018-08-28 16:22:14 Why nationalize the oil industry when a simple accounting for the negative externalities in the form of a carbon tax would make the prices of green energy reflect the savings over oil, and the free market would solve our emissions problem
3614 2018-08-28 16:22:00 good night, ikonics!!! use castor oil on you eyebrows and lashes too make them fuller and longer hahaha. dream happy dreams!

3616 2018-08-28 16:21:59 He has a point , if Oil as a commodity has a use case , being traded on the commodities market , wont it be simple for Oil companies to purchase Crude from Venezuela by using the token , which will be a lubricant in cutting down  cost and reducing friction @BankXRP @C3_Nik
3617 2018-08-28 16:21:50 @SchlenkRusty will you be at portsmouth this week for the lucas oil race
3618 2018-08-28 16:21:34 Tumeric + peppermint + fevergrass + Honey(dont add when water is too hot) + a corkfull of olive oil + lime = greatest tea ever.
3619 2018-08-28 16:21:21 The collapse of our eco system, exon Valdez, deep water horizon, the bagdad oil fires, Vietnam war, korean war, cuban missle crisis, government super sites leaking radiation everywhere, 3 mile island, Chernobyl
3620 2018-08-28 16:21:12 It sure did, in Norway. Oil profits fund national healthcare and free university education. Of course, you need a govt that is actually concerned about the citizens, an impossibility in the USA.
3621 2018-08-28 16:20:47 They know wassup when I pull up at the oil place. “The whole nine again?” YASSSS bit

3624 2018-08-28 16:20:24 I'm amused to see, that your wife has also adopted your understanding of "a bit" of olive oil .
Looks great, might get back to this once temperatures drop below 0C 
3625 2018-08-28 16:19:48 Clearly 5m, but who is getting the oil out, who holds the licences to extract it?  I assume it's the huge names in the oil industry, something that isn't entirely based in Scotland

3627 2018-08-28 16:19:29 Only dressing you need is olive oil and white vinegar.
3628 2018-08-28 16:19:26 I was saying the same thing about you and your petrol dollar dark money Republicans when you all started expanding military for oil security.  You reap what you sow. 

Now Bob Dole, McCain, and all of Bushes ilk are saints. When I was just as terrified of them as I am now,
3629 2018-08-28 16:19:13 How? cause Venezuela  does have oil or what needs done by Maduro to guarantee it’s backed by oil....in my view it’s a brilliant move #My2cents
3630 2018-08-28 16:19:09 My virgin oil ears are being tainted with such lewdness
3631 2018-08-28 16:19:06 @sainsburys Chester store: 20 varieties of olive oil. No walnut oil. What’s up with that?

3636 2018-08-28 16:18:55 wtf cbd oil does not even get you high...How on earth did it 'hospitalize' 7 people? This sounds alot more like mass hysteria than anything cbd oil did? even if an allergic reaction was possible in 1 person, that does not explain 6 more :P
3637 2018-08-28 16:18:51 I just want to change my oil and sleep.

3639 2018-08-28 16:18:41 Hi Lucy, thanks for getting in touch. We add a small amount of palm oil to our peanut butter to help stabilise the product and stop it from separating. About 50% of oil in peanut butter comes from the actual peanuts – this tends to separate from the paste if left alone. Thank you

3644 2018-08-28 16:18:17 Your basis ?

Is this from seed oil ?
If yes, then maybe.

But have you looked at BTL (biomass to liquid) ?

Its a different paradigm.
Specially when augmented with nuclear derived hydrogen.
3645 2018-08-28 16:18:11 This is actually an incredible example of why print media has been losing the battle to social media, for years, they'd report and only the most die hard could investigate. Now anyone can, so print can't peddle the same snake oil, it seems to be a cognitive dissonance to not see

3648 2018-08-28 16:17:42 Once your oil starts to shimmer - you're ready for the fish. Season the skin liberally with salt and pepper (this helps the sear) gently place the fillets in the pan, allowing them to fall away from you (you don't want to get an oil burn)!
3649 2018-08-28 16:17:34 well started,  hopefully this trend would no more be a maiden, bio-fuel is going to replace mineral oil for each&every applications most often. Administration to initiate example n  encourage growth of this field.
3650 2018-08-28 16:17:13 Turkeys activities were the catalyst in this conflict. Remember Turkey aiding foreign fighters into Syria The US found Turks supplied ISIS, bought ISIS oil, smuggled weapons to extremists The life savings of refugees & 5 billion from the EU American soldiers died!
3651 2018-08-28 16:16:50 @AmbJohnBolton The Iranian government is breaking international sanctions with the support of Iraq. America must work to secure the Iraqi oil money. America must control Iraqi oil.
3652 2018-08-28 16:16:46 Eggs mixed with cheese and sometimes with prosciutto or similar salumi, then fried with olive oil until the coagulation. Similar to french omelette, but better 
3653 2018-08-28 16:16:43 @SecPompeo The Iranian government is breaking international sanctions with the support of Iraq. America must work to secure the Iraqi oil money. America must control Iraqi oil.
3654 2018-08-28 16:16:39 Good morning Vancouver!
It’s cool but clear 

I though today I had to participate in another new student orientation but I was wrong. ( that was for domestic students) So I’ll do my routine.

Must buy:
CLEANSING OIL 雪肌精!
Almost out of stock!
And of course BEER!
3655 2018-08-28 16:16:36 For beginners, we suggest a non-stick. First, and foremost you want to make sure you pat your fillets dry w/ a paper towel (extra moisture will make the fish stick). Get your pan hot over a medium-medium/high flame. Once it starts to smoke, put in your oil (grapeseed is the best)
3656 2018-08-28 16:16:34 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
3657 2018-08-28 16:16:17 เจ้า 2 คนนี่นะ 55555555555

How many gallons of fuel will be used?
Consumption of engine oil?

If there are benefits of fish oil beyond the TG/chol effect, then may have sufficient power. Some pre-clinical evidence that fish oils have anti-inflamm effect, etc.

3718 2018-08-28 16:09:48 The EEA is slightly different for both Norway and Switzerland. Norway exports oil which is a major advantage to them. It would ‘honour’ the result and do the least damage. JRM and cronies trying to mould the past though, as that solution doesn’t fit their agenda.

3924 2018-08-28 15:49:07 The tragedy of the UK is that its economy relies on legal gangterism in the city, in pharma, in oil and mining, in weapons and has a media to cover the rich who buy its politics. Bring that down and we all suffer.

More fuel is burnt,  so more is cost, even without any traffic. 
Engine oil and other parts are to be changed with more usage, and repair / maintenance cost is also there. 
You have to pay for parking fee / arrangements at home and office too.  That adds to cost.

3981 2018-08-28 15:43:05 With this approach:
90 mg/dl TG lowering = 18 mg/dl cholesterol lowering
CTT:  for every 39 mg/dl cholesterol lowering, about 22% reduction CAD
So, 18 mg/dl chol lowering = 10% reduction in CAD

So, if a fish oil lowers TG by 90 mg/dl, might only get 10% reduction CAD!

4003 2018-08-28 15:41:13 Also govt. Offers absolutely no subsidy on petrol or diesel.
Diesel is naturally cheaper oil.

It is just cheaper without subsidy.

4033 2018-08-28 15:37:50 Ingraffia's paper was funded by the oil and gas industry. He is honest about having a bias, because literally every human does.

4057 2018-08-28 15:34:58 If price of oil fallen 0.22% @ 0.22%, @ $68.72/barrel, how it translates to Iran's economy? Will Hassan Rouhani out-tweet Pres. Trump?
4058 2018-08-28 15:34:57 "Trump effect". Ongoing GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas. REFERENDUM saves lives of Jews and Christians in Nigeria @VP . Hebrew Biafra is the origin of most Black Americans. THEY ARE WATCHING!.
4059 2018-08-28 15:34:53 I'm in Cleveland, OH & I hope we don't get a strong north wind that could push his oil slicked policies across the lake...

4065 2018-08-28 15:34:10 you could start by diminishing our oil dependency. 
but who am i kidding. that's how you make money... world be damned
4066 2018-08-28 15:33:52 Killers of the Flower Moon.  Chronicle of how the Osage Indian tribe was systematically cheated out of their oil rights by big industry/FBI subterfuge.  May induce rage but the various perspectives offered in the book is very interesting.
4067 2018-08-28 15:33:50 We gave up oil rights years ago, huge mistake. . . Best chance now is to get off of oil completely.   Stop all foreign aide and use that money to benefit the US.

When they read the news about possible hacking of EC server, the newscaster could not pronounce it correctly and today about Saudi Oil company going IPO, the news caster was saying OIPO.

b.  even if getting at lipolysis pathway, degree TRL lowering may not be enough (studies on margin of power)

4119 2018-08-28 15:28:02 (For ex., I only use regular white flour in all of them even when she asks for various different types, I use sunflower oil instead of any other vegetable oils, almond milk instead of soya milk, etc. But the recipes always work, regardless!)
4120 2018-08-28 15:27:39 I do. And zero would be better. Do you went an argument from me to pay higher prices for something when I could pay less? You won't get it. But Alberta had much oil and gas. That accounted for billions in revenue. Health care is much better here.

Therefore, oil was around 34.2% cheaper in March’18 in comparison to May’14

4193 2018-08-28 15:19:39 Push renewable energy so big oil will have to deal with market pressure and not be able to drive increases when their costs are decreasing
4194 2018-08-28 15:19:31 Gas, diesel, petrol, all are burning holes in people's pocket not because world oil prices are high but because govt has decided to recover the bank losses by imposing one of the highest tax rates on fuel.

4203 2018-08-28 15:18:49 Your assmption that diesel rates are kept low for farmers is wrong ab-initio.
Diesel prices are based on the oil prices. Petrol is expensive being a premium oil in comparison.
Maybe most of the vehicles made for commercial purpose hv diesel engines to bring down the cost of bzns.
4204 2018-08-28 15:18:42 Drilling for oil.  Gee, isn't that how you get it out of the ground?  The 'energy deniers' can't see that?

Cook the beans in boiling water for 2 hours, then mash them and fry them up in the oil w/onion, cumin, salt. Wrap in a soft tortilla!

4227 2018-08-28 15:16:50 TBH, It could last for years as oil is in the sweet spot between $60 - $80 and inflation is low.

In the article, the edible application that is sort of touched on is the use of leaves from this plant as a vegetable like turnip greens, which is done on a limited basis in China.

4301 2018-08-28 15:08:45 A real "hide the decline" is in the lack of coverage in showing how the UK North Sea crude oil production is depleting just because it's a finite & non-renewable resource.  AGW and Peak Oil are much more difficult to deny when combined!

4322 2018-08-28 15:07:05 you answer it yourself. Interest rates are unsustainably low. Increasing them to 3% is not going to kill productive sectors. If an investment is not profitable at 3% but it is at 1%, it is not an investment, it is a time bomb
4323 2018-08-28 15:06:59 I also get the sense that the "honeymoon" for Ballard is over. Writers like @GreggDoyelStar have already started to question him. If the Colts start poorly in 2018 - and there are fewer fans at Lucas Oil Stadium as a result - Ballard will start feeling heat.

an oil blend I could drop into my lil diffuser. I would LOVE that.
4461 2018-08-28 14:50:45 Hi Alexi, great question! Because EVs don’t need oil, there won’t be that offering, but some service centers may add different services if the industry demands.
4462 2018-08-28 14:50:44 That’s the important bit Took the oil sold off everything British including the council house and 
“still “ managed to stuff up the UK economy

Is our arch enemy Putin our enemy out of conviction or because he sees NATO as an enemy of Russia

4485 2018-08-28 14:48:33 Rub extra virgin olive oil into your skin before bed. Sounds counterintuitive but the oil will reduce the amount of oil your skin produces and therefore less spots. Wash face before and in the morning.
4486 2018-08-28 14:48:31 There was at least one restaurant that if they found peanut shells on your table they'd add $5 to your bill.  Something to do with hardwood floors and peanut oil so they claimed.

As far as I can see the only sanctions in place are against individual Government officials and preventing them from trying to steal oil revenue. In unrelated news Maria Chavez has assets in excess of $4.3bn.

4542 2018-08-28 14:42:31 Mr. Nair like your graphs. 2014 was an election year and crude oil was at its highest.  khangress they Maintened the fuel price in India to 71 but in the hind sight defaulted in huge oil bills.
4543 2018-08-28 14:42:26 Look I haven't denied that the fall in oil prices helped sink the Venezuelan economy, but as almost all other oil-based economies haven't likewise fallen, it indicates that the problem for Venezuela was far more fundamental than a lack of economic diversity.

Also crude oil was more expensive & in turn, pms would have been more expensive under GEJ than over the past 3 yrs. So whichever way you look at it, in real terms we’re spending more on fuel subsidy now

I think she made a mistake, but it was not a cynical political move
4583 2018-08-28 14:39:25 If the truth be told. Canada stop competing when the Liberals took over with NDP's help. Harper was at the verge of delivering his expected budget surplus before 2015 election when SUDDEN oil prices dived from $100 to $60. Thanks to OPEC, Wall St & Obama's newly appointed Yellen.
4584 2018-08-28 14:39:21 Unfortunately, if history is any guide, more income means more graft/theft, and more anger. This leads to a rise in alternative factions, offering to spread the wealth, but with an eye to filling their own pockets. The structural issues remain, more oil, or less.

4593 2018-08-28 14:38:01 This was after the rupee traded weak for most of the trading session tracking the rise in oil prices. The Rupee ended at 70.11 vs. yesterday’s close of 70.16.

4601 2018-08-28 14:37:24 PSU, consumer durables, oil & gas and realty stocks succumbed to  selling pressure. Besides, some covering-up of pending short positions  by participants ahead of August derivatives expiry on Thursday too  supported the bull-run.
4602 2018-08-28 14:37:20 Can’t talk that slick shit to a can of oil!
4603 2018-08-28 14:37:14 It was principally sunk by a collapse in oil prices and no other revenue streams to plug the gap (granted oil sector was a leaky barrel by this point, I'll find the FP article that details this).

4637 2018-08-28 14:34:07 If ___ was from Bakersfield, he'd probably work the oil fields. Maybe be a farmer driving tractors getting soil tilled. Probably smoking foil, drilling oil 'til he hits it rich. Drive a lifted truck and buy his wife a pair of phony tits.

Actually, this isn't the first time our gov't has invested in the oil patch to kickstart economic activity.

Actually, the original TMX line was funded by the federal gov't.

Actually, so was Hiberna.

Actually, so were the tar sands.

4671 2018-08-28 14:29:57 The price increased when oil went up, and the market adjusted.  When oil went down, rather than lower the prices, the oil companies saw an opportunity to increase their profits and, by God, they weren't going to let that opportunity slip away.
4672 2018-08-28 14:29:52 It’s literally next to you. [She glances at him and arches an eyebrow.] And it feels better with oil.

4676 2018-08-28 14:29:34 I believe a lot of longs were hoping for a lower re-entry on Brent.  This rally has them scratching their heads whether to buy in, or call it a bull trap. Data has been improving (oil on water, lower exports), but nothing outright bullish. How many will gamble to get in early?
4677 2018-08-28 14:29:28 Just like Trump served their interests by killing 200 of their merc’s in Syria, or how Trump gave Ukraine missile defense weapons to combat Russia, or that Trump’s energy policy is decimating Russia’s economy, or Trump calling out Germany for undertaking a Russian oil pipeline?

4696 2018-08-28 14:27:03 I’m sorry, but how can this be possible to spend only £40 on food for 4 people. Do you count what you replenish in your dry store cupboard? Do you exclude olive oil etc from the list?  Do you grow all your own veg?  I’m intrigued!

4700 2018-08-28 14:26:40 who will get trapped in the first round?
4701 2018-08-28 14:26:40 Agree. An important element, though : the quasi oil-indexed contracts. In a recent presentation, Gazprom's Head of Contracts Structuring argues that if quasi oil-indexed contracts taken into account, then oil indexes still dominant in European pricing formation >for Q1 2018.
4702 2018-08-28 14:26:35 [He sits up and glances around.] Well, where’s the oil stuff? Why does there have to be oil?
4703 2018-08-28 14:26:21 I agree. Still enjoy publicly funded incentives to lose the oil dependencies. Money is a colonial construct created to control Indigenous populations so I’m  when you talk about how expensive doing the right thing is.
4704 2018-08-28 14:26:19 I know what you mean. It goes against the grain to have screens on for startup and shutdown.  I am assured though that the TXi screens are designed that way - and of course you have vital info like oil pressure on the screens which you need to be monitoring during start.
4705 2018-08-28 14:26:01 just wait for the day traders to collect the profits 
4706 2018-08-28 14:25:59 Idk that, we apparently found each other on the website, I sent you Motor Oil and we never followed each other
4707 2018-08-28 14:25:55 Norway's oil production is 1,647,975 barrels a day, Canada's is 3,662,694 barrels a day. Norway runs solely on oil and has a huge trillion dollar oil fund. We probably wouldn't be able to run solely on oil, but it would probably get rid of our deficit and run us a surplus.
4708 2018-08-28 14:25:43 Hahaha. You're not wrong. But the efficasent oil was all mine. 
4709 2018-08-28 14:25:31 My man got me coffee this morning, 2 redbulls, put gas in my car, checked my oil, and put air in my tires.

Why don’t we put government pensions in line with CPP and put all the savings into green energy? Why no CTax on Saudi oil?

4727 2018-08-28 14:22:56 True, checked it. Thanks for correcting me there. 
I actually checked figures for veggie oil (FAO) and jetfuel, your 1/2 proportion seems correct. And I'm pretty sure we're not growing oil crops all over the world, so my calculation does seem to exaggerate the figures.
4728 2018-08-28 14:22:47 That's not an answer son that's a cop out.
Why would WM pay 13BN PER FUCKING YEAR MIND for the scots with no return at all,might as well burn 13 BN
Why would they pay that

4738 2018-08-28 14:20:49 Is there a water soluble white flower essential oil? Or omega essential oil? Puta sakit lawas ko. 2kgs in 2 days of training after 3 weeks hiatus is no joke.

4740 2018-08-28 14:20:19 At the Hyundai dealership getting my oil changed and a salesman comes up to me and gives me his card and told me to call him if I ever had any problems/questions. Niggas tryna be slick as hell these days, it’s a good thing he was fine!!!

4748 2018-08-28 14:19:25 USD 1H big push higher last 15 minutes. 5th wave down correction ENDING. Bullish confirmation comes at 94.54. GOLD lower. DUST ?

4753 2018-08-28 14:19:00 do you have essential oils??? If you rub a bit of peppermint oil on your temples itll help
4754 2018-08-28 14:18:44 you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes that you can do these things. Among them are a few Texas oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or businessman from other areas.
4755 2018-08-28 14:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
4756 2018-08-28 14:18:40 Freeze Omega-3 fish oil pills (360 or 500 MG) and take two a day! It’s what I do and it works wonders

4766 2018-08-28 14:17:28 Noticed a rough idle on start in my 2014 #hyundai #veloster #turbo. I'm still about 5k from recommended oil service, but apparently this is a common issue. Every instinct I have tells me this is not okay.

4768 2018-08-28 14:17:11 @VP This regime must pay a heavy punishment for its evil acts, the international community must stand up to this anti-humanitarian regime, the compromise has come to an end.We emphasize that oil and banking sanctions should be implemented without any derogation and with all power
4769 2018-08-28 14:17:08 our new president, who declared last week that we would "double its research in the next 5 years" seems to be slowly figuring out that he cannot just tell the faculty what to do and expect they will, you know, do it (until July 1 of this year, he was an oil company executive...)

4775 2018-08-28 14:16:30 International laws do not allow such provocative and hatred activities, the world is standing on the throne of the war, the international crisis will work on oil It will use by terrorists the enemy of humanity, for their fascinating purposes #MuhammadTheMerciful

4777 2018-08-28 14:16:26 Inflation is going thru the roof. Because they run out all the capitalist, the oil companies etc, now their people are starving eating their pets. At no time in history has it worked.
4778 2018-08-28 14:16:18 hmm didn't know they made cream. My husband used the oil in his vapor for his issues and it helps. Cream probably works even better. 
I've used prescription strength capsaaicin cream, it does work pretty good. Thanks <3

4794 2018-08-28 14:15:05 RT @EIU_Commodities: The tentative trade deal between the #US & #Mexico has boosted oil prices in the last day. Ongoing talks with #Canada will probably be tense, however, meaning that price volatility will remain a risk over the next week.

4807 2018-08-28 14:13:50 With all hype and talk of CBD oil right now... you should check into our new hemp oil. It's water soluble so your body actually absorbs more! Does your CBD oil float on water, because if it does then how much is just passing through your body? 
4808 2018-08-28 14:13:48 So if the govt is telling us that we buy oil, then why previously they’ve been telling us a high oil price is good for us?
4809 2018-08-28 14:13:40 CBD oil!!
4810 2018-08-28 14:13:38 Not actually but for America its more of the same since America has no worker force capable to travel the world doing construction contracts where ever needed which get the backing of the Chinese Govt & another nation, use non-stick foil when cooking not grease or oil.
4811 2018-08-28 14:13:35 There are many more other fish to fry when it comes to Imperial Bank. I hope all will fry in the same oil DCJ is in. Good job @DPPS_KE

4845 2018-08-28 14:10:27 I think the begging the question comes in because wet is a condition already associated with and derived from water. If we say an oil feels wet it is because we are comparing it to the sensation of water.
4846 2018-08-28 14:10:26 Ayam laughing already

4856 2018-08-28 14:09:20 The auto sector is a loser - which will become even more apparent in 5 yrs. Canada is resource rich w tons of water. We sit on high ground, we have energy, oil, water, minerals, vast tracks of land, 3rd biggest country in the world, 35 mil ppl, our position is amazing!
4857 2018-08-28 14:09:14 They couldn't lift the Jones Act for Puerto Rico but they could for Cuba/Russia re the oil pumps and rigs.

Russia and Cuba have been slowly defrosting their relationship over the past few years, btw.
4858 2018-08-28 14:09:05 Can we all agree that essential oil diffusers, even if you think they are miraculous and have healed all your ills, should be kept home and not brought to work?

My wife's had to bring it up with two colleagues in two days now, in a pretty small office space. Seems obvious to me.
4859 2018-08-28 14:08:53 I have a room diffuser & I put a few drops of lavender oil in it before bed each night for relaxation. You can use the eucalyptus oil in a diffuser if you get congested to help you breathe a bit easier. Tea tree oil is a great disinfectant & can be used on nail fungus.

4866 2018-08-28 14:08:17 No deal is a deal. No deal has always been political snake oil. The EU is a legal entity, therefore there will need to be a legislative arrangements (deals) for withdrawal.

Wouldn’t go to mr tire for a non tire issue lmao or jiffy lube for a non oil problem
4872 2018-08-28 14:07:55 change the oil in your getaway car
4873 2018-08-28 14:07:46 Exactly why I do it before. I would rather oil be absorbed before instead of waiting until it tries to seep through my foundation and get absorbed

4880 2018-08-28 14:07:22 California has the benefit of having the most natural resources of any state. That doesn’t mean it’s ran as efficiently as it could be. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world, how are leftists policies working out down there?
4881 2018-08-28 14:07:20 Lavender is a calming essential oil and is really good for anxiety and helping with restful sleep. Dab a little on your wrists, your temples and the bottom of your feet.

GOLD & USD 1H range trade sidways as USD finishes correction lower today, GOLD should move lower. WATCH
4884 2018-08-28 14:07:01 Climate change denial is uniquely a conservative position with roots in corporate worship, big oil funded junk science, and fundamentalist Christianity. I'm not surprised Candace began denying climate change after her "awakening."
4885 2018-08-28 14:06:55 The future generations deserve a clean planet. The greed of this admin. and it’s oil and gas cronies is astounding.
The future is coming, regardless.

4887 2018-08-28 14:06:52 Trump dont care we need more coal plants and oil rig jobs please!!!!
4888 2018-08-28 14:06:43 Because you can't put an old oil into a new one, you can't use worn piece of cloth on your new jacket jacket, not sure it will look new or old.
4889 2018-08-28 14:06:39 Went to get my oil changed

Me- 
4890 2018-08-28 14:06:34 If that were true, why would the disappearing coal industry need referential treatment?
If the whaling oil industry had similar gov help, they might still be around.

4894 2018-08-28 14:06:02 Oil touches seven-week highs after signs of tighter supply: The oil price rose towards its highest since early July on Tuesday, thanks to evidence of still-modest increases in output from OPEC and improving Chinese refinery demand.
4895 2018-08-28 14:05:53 But that gulf of Mexico oil spill was gangster. Took them 87days to put it under control.

Brian Hook, from the US State Dept, said last month: "Our goal increase pressure on the Iranian regime by reducing to zero its revenues from crude oil sales.

4909 2018-08-28 14:04:08 I am an Okie (although embarrased to admit). As long as a candidate is ultra-conservative and runs on Jesus, guns, oil and anti-abortion they are embraced. The fact that someone like @StittforGov could cause a runoff election is proof of that.

4938 2018-08-28 14:01:24 It's never oil prices, it's cluelessness.
4939 2018-08-28 14:01:06 Good! These company’s have become monopoly’s. If standard oil was a monopoly and they only sold oil then how is Facebook not a monopoly there is no competition for facebook
4940 2018-08-28 14:00:56 Not just oil companies. ALL resource companies. Forestry, mining, even gravel companies pay bonds, and into an orphan fund.

4968 2018-08-28 13:58:27 I totally agree. I just got through saying earlier that alternative energies can work right along side of the Oil and gas industry. It just can't compete with it.
4969 2018-08-28 13:58:17 Oh that's right, I forgot it's just another essential oil that if you use that you don't need to vaccinate or do anything else.

4973 2018-08-28 13:57:35 The easy answer is “no, it’s not the same as low sulphur fuel oil” the difficulty though is that it isn’t clear what low sulphur fuel oil is - it could be a variety of things. Low sulphur is good news, but the density of the fuel oil and how it responds if spilt is critical.

4982 2018-08-28 13:56:53 It is, but oil isn’t the only and most decisive factor anymore. With even Gazprom saying only 37% of its 2017 gas sales were linked to oil, the role of crude oil in setting European gas prices will be declining with time

5020 2018-08-28 13:53:42 Ok but I think this is getting lost in the weeds here.

Basic point:  we’re investing in some of the dirtiest oil on the planet.  The *overall cost is expected to be ~$20 billion.  We should be able to do better and yes, investing in solar should be a part of that strategy.
5021 2018-08-28 13:53:41 I was on the hunt for shaving cream for people with eczema and realized that almost all of them are super expensive and use coconut oil. Well, I have coconut oil. Can't I just use that? Google says yes. Okay, well that solves that.

5024 2018-08-28 13:53:33 I thought the U.S. was becoming energy independent? Producing and exporting more oil than ever before? That's what we're being told! So what the Hell is going on? Wait...I think we all know. We are just powerless to do anything about it. Oil companies rule the world.

5032 2018-08-28 13:52:58 Ask an expert and you will know the real figures, AW 139 helicopters uses 0.45 liter of fuel per km, uses JP 4 which is kerosene oil , now you all authors and pilots can calculate the cost

5038 2018-08-28 13:52:43 Palm oil prices could pick up "moderately" in coming months, as palm oil output in Malaysia will fall to 19.8 MMT this year from 19.92 MMT LY vs 20.2 MMT expected previously–Oil World-@TradeADMIS
Global palm oil output is anyway to rise to 70.22 MMT this year vs 67.94 MMT in 2017

As the Dollar makes the internal shift from wave A to B soon enough, Oil should start to struggle again. The wave C down in the dollar & any Oil struggle will be a good signal for whether it's moving into the heart of wave 5 of C lower. 63 of note.
5094 2018-08-28 13:47:12 Depends on Coffee quality. Many cheap brands are higher in (burning byproduct) Acrylamide - which is highly cancerogenic; so, that would outweigh benefits (if any) of liver cancer prevention.

5132 2018-08-28 13:43:58 Correct. I've seen the wind farms in West Texas. There's nothing wrong with them. Wind power can work right along side of the Oil and gas industry, they'll just never be able to replace it.

डेंगू चा #ताप सगळीकडे पसरत आहे.आपल्या गुडघ्या पासून पायाच्या पंज्या पर्यंत खोबरे तेल #coconut_oil लावा. हे सकाळ पासुन संध्याकाळ पर्यंत एक #एंटीबायोटिक चं काम करतं.डेंगू चा मच्छर गुडघ्या पेक्षा उंच उडू शकत नाही

5160 2018-08-28 13:40:42 august has no significance to me beyond the sheer amount of oil blotting sheets i have to use after walking to my classes
5161 2018-08-28 13:40:42 I’d like to put a moratorium on essential oil evangelism. Or, at least restrictions: is the person asking what oil you recommend for ____? Yes? Then, speak. No? Then, don’t.
5162 2018-08-28 13:40:39 I really like how it looks like it was drawn with oil pastels and yet it looks so dull but sleek and well made.

5173 2018-08-28 13:38:56 #oott is oil a classic  buy on rumour sell on fact market ??
5174 2018-08-28 13:38:56 I also use it with the tea tree oil spray you can buy it in a two pack
5175 2018-08-28 13:38:49 #Nigeria’s lack of working refineries means that Africa’s largest oil producer cannot refine its biggest export. To cater to local demand, it must import refined petrol while exporting crude.
5176 2018-08-28 13:38:37 ลองเปลี่ยนโฟมล้างหน้า ใช้ครีมแบบ oil free เซรั่มอย่าขาดเช่นกัลลล
5177 2018-08-28 13:38:27 Also you can blame oil price for most of the dip, but NDP is to blame for the slow crawl up. Every oil bearing place on earth is booming right now, we’re barely above idol

5180 2018-08-28 13:37:52 No fried foods (cooking oil from animal fat)
5181 2018-08-28 13:37:41 Well, of course. Oil (and natural resources in general) are the double edged sword of development (see “Dutch disease”). The problem was giving the state more and more control of the economy to solve oil dependancy. Everyone just raids the government coffers pretty much always.
5182 2018-08-28 13:37:38 The Rule of law and Fundamental Human Rights, are the oil which propel the machineries of a Democracy. 
Any Government who believes other wise  is wrong.
5183 2018-08-28 13:37:37 but like.... can they make it with coconut oil
5184 2018-08-28 13:37:36 Just back from an oil change & hard drive defrag have I missed anything on Scottish Twitter? #DissolveTheUnion #McBot
5185 2018-08-28 13:37:35 Are you aware of huge wind farms in West Texas and even this state is promoting solar? Oil may still exist but it’s stock has declined.
5186 2018-08-28 13:37:23 Mannn I Be thinkin any issue under the hood can be solved by an oil change 
5187 2018-08-28 13:37:14 La seule solution que les écolos ont trouvé est la taxation des citoyens que vous mettez en péril financier et de les rendre responsables des pollution que les politiques les riches les banquiers les actionnaires et les financiers sont les véritables responsables c'est injuste

5192 2018-08-28 13:37:03 And the price of oil close to infinity.
5193 2018-08-28 13:37:02 @Araksya @Tonysuniverse The best way to protect yourself from mosquitos and West Nile virus is to have two drops of oregano oil in a glass of water daily for a week on then a week off etc. mosquitoes will not get near you if you have that in your bloodstream

5197 2018-08-28 13:36:30 My deep, abiding love for cooking in and cleaning my cast iron skillet is no secret. I'm a bit old-fashioned when it comes to maintaining a super-slick, no-stick finish on my pan: I clean it with oil and salt, rinse with water, heat it to dry, and slick it with a little oil …
5198 2018-08-28 13:36:23 CC is going to have tremendous costs. Money spent to fight CC is better than on bullets.  Oil and gas just won’t be good investments.  They already aren’t.  Solar will undercut them soon anyways it’s just we are running out of time.
5199 2018-08-28 13:36:13 I take the CBD oil separately but yes I love it!
5200 2018-08-28 13:36:05 You're moving the chicken to early most likely, make sure to use hot oil, sometimes things just stick, and use nonstick for eggs and things with high amount of sugar cause it's easy to clean burnt sugar off of it

5205 2018-08-28 13:35:23 My lease is up in two months and my maintenance light just went on for an oil change. I should ignore it right? lol
5206 2018-08-28 13:35:08 Cuba sent doctors in exchange for oil didn’t they?
5207 2018-08-28 13:35:05 Yes 300 years,but it all went tits up when scots found out thier oil wealth had been hidden from them for 30 years.
Now scots have no say at westminster.

5215 2018-08-28 13:33:33 It is bankrupt Canadian energy policy that trades huge amounts of our fresh water for oil, gas, and mineral expansion. Think fracking; think tar sands; think tailings ponds. What is ignored, of course, is the well being of ordinary people.

5217 2018-08-28 13:33:31 Tony...you could replace Ant and star with Dec with that commentary 
5218 2018-08-28 13:33:15 Doesn't infer anything until it is known what it is - i.e., recording rate. Some parameters are recorded slower that others but the oil parameters seem awfully slow. There is speculation elsewhere burning fuel/oil blew into the aircon tubes. It is a matter of exclusion.
5219 2018-08-28 13:32:58 You forgot reduced the amount of barrels of oil they bought from Nigeria close to no buying..
5220 2018-08-28 13:32:41 Not la mer, for goodness sake. It's second ingredient is mineral oil, a ridiculously cheap ingredient and it's so overpriced. For fancy: May Lindstrom, for lower priced: deciem (numerous options but The Ordinary Natural Moisturising Factors + HA is what I currently use)

5230 2018-08-28 13:31:08 Are you adding the CBD oil? Like it so far?

5232 2018-08-28 13:31:06 #ukfoodhour  Yes!  There is a yam that they eat in India (Indiam Suran I think).  You have to put plently of oil or gloves on your hands and then peel, wash and then salt generously.  Keep for overnight.  Then drain and then wash.  Then fry like chips and the add to curry sauce.

5235 2018-08-28 13:30:26 We mostly need to help solar accelerate that will lower cost of oil barrels.  Already solar is cheaper and will undercut bids on almost any other type of energy so oil is already not a great investment long term.
5236 2018-08-28 13:30:24 I got an oil lamp
5237 2018-08-28 13:30:20 Lessons can be learned from the Iraq that was 'liberated' from the iron rule of Saddam Hussein by the U.S. invasion. Power exchanged hands but was anybody liberated?  What stands is corrupt rulers that profit by protecting Exxon's oil extraction. Kleptocracy reigns.
5238 2018-08-28 13:30:20 生きて……
5239 2018-08-28 13:30:18 About to go for an oil change. Let’s touch and agree that that’s the only thing I’ll have to pay for. Amen
5240 2018-08-28 13:30:07 NAFTA obliges Canada to export 74% its oil and 52% its natural gas to the USA.

You think the USA will walk away from that?

Hold that thought.
5241 2018-08-28 13:29:52 No the oil company lol
5242 2018-08-28 13:29:48 Not saying it was fiction but definitely inflated by individuals motivated by $ with no regard for the ppl losing their homes because the lawmakers were already bought & paid for AND you realize everyone that's buys oil from #SaudiArabia does so in USD which props the dollar up

5245 2018-08-28 13:29:29 Under Obama USA ramped up oil prodn, built thousands miles pipeline, started offshore oil exports, developed LNG exports while Canada stalled, giving up  $30 billion/yr to our economy.  It's the USA who gets the free pass under amateurish CDN leadership.

5253 2018-08-28 13:28:29 The right is a small group proportionate to earth population but they are beholden to oil co’s. But yes billions need to be spent but probably the cost of a couple air craft carriers would go a long way in this.

5264 2018-08-28 13:27:29 So paying an NGO to collaborate will somehow make these plantations ok for certified palm oil?
5265 2018-08-28 13:27:20 Oh we had one of those, does it burn oil? Ours did and I hope my new 300 doesn’t start doing that 
5266 2018-08-28 13:27:14 Hmm, not sure I agree with the analogy. Tobacco is a vice. Not to go all Alex Epstein, but fossil fuels were the foundation of the energy system, without which modern life would have been impossible. How many consumers would have stopped using oil even if they knew climate risks?
5267 2018-08-28 13:27:13 The C_A overthrew their government for the British oil company (present day BP) and installed the Shaw. From the interference of the C_A in a democratically elected government and the disasters that ensued has led us to where we are today.

5302 2018-08-28 13:23:14 Turkey is profiting off all this in so many ways. Money from the EU, lined up to be a member of the EU, cheap or free black oil from the terrorists,a chance to kill the innocent kurds.... the list goes on and on

5311 2018-08-28 13:22:05 Dershowitz may understand Admiralty law but not history. He conveniently forgets that Iran did have a democratically elected President who wanted to nationalize their oil resources for the Iranian people.

5350 2018-08-28 13:17:12 That’s a very valid point. X-Men comics of the 60’s thru the mid-00’s have value as both reading material & collectibles that vastly exceeds their heating gas/oil replacement value. Squirrel Girl & America only have the value of how many BTU’s their combustion can produce.

5359 2018-08-28 13:16:27 It wasn't bad, IT WAS TRAGIC and it's still affecting the ecosystem. There is a layer of oil that sits on the ocean floor for HUNDREDS. OF. MILES. I would love to see a response from the fisherman who's businesses tanked and never recovered down there too.
5360 2018-08-28 13:16:24 It's utter foolishness for a grown up man to support another man who insults his father simply because he didn't agree with his father on some issues. When will we value our own? Trump was frustrated by @MBuhari stand on currency swap and oil deals.
5361 2018-08-28 13:16:17 Sure we label them Zionists they are still human beings they have a different ideology than others. I know some who want a home for Jews but not an Israel that behaves like all colonialists have and do still today, killing humans for land oil gas minerals.

5446 2018-08-28 13:08:01 The list of scams under Congress UPA government is too long and looks never-ending. A few more in the list are Telgi scam, Insurance scam, Telecom scam (Sukh Ram), Fodder scam, Ketan Parekh scandal, Taj corridor case, Oil-for-food programme scam,
5447 2018-08-28 13:08:00 Until you slide out on some oil and mangle your foot. But enough about me…
5448 2018-08-28 13:07:58 "US state inherently a white institution," that's where we disagree given our non-white population. Say we steal oil from a country; whites & non-whites alike in the US will benefit from lower prices. You seem to view as white supremacy "that which benefits the US population."
5449 2018-08-28 13:07:55 Until the discovery of oil, more money, more money to buy more sophisticated weapons. It’s not a religion of peace it’s a warring tribe that walked out of Saudi over 1600 yrs ago.
5450 2018-08-28 13:07:53 and lets just say for now that they signed a secret treaty with big oil
5451 2018-08-28 13:07:53 I'm gonna chug 3 tablespoons of olive oil for dinner uwu
5452 2018-08-28 13:07:48 USA both buys and sells, as does Canada. Price discount due to dilbit being thicker and more sour & pipelines being full. You don't buy oil full price from SU when the shipping cost is so high. Which is why I argue for refinery build in Ft Mac at any price. 50yrs it'll be cheap.
5453 2018-08-28 13:07:44 1.  Just because America burns the oil we extract shouldn't mean we get a pass on those emissions. 2. If 50 countries accepted your premise we get no where.  However if 50 countries commit we start solving the problem.

5459 2018-08-28 13:07:15 Where does the Halliburton oil industry end and the CIA begin? Cheney would conspire to destroy the twin towers while George W.

5477 2018-08-28 13:04:20 Hmmm... You're touchy. I was referring to those who who have been deflationistas for years. And wrong, since early 2016. Arguably before too, as the oil crash was, even then, likely transitory. I was hugely bullish USTs into early 2016, then less and less and now not. Chill.

5494 2018-08-28 13:02:42 having heard our  Masters rail against diesel fuel cars, I can state that they managed to turn the tide towards more efficient use of hydrocarbons. And by that I mean that people were using less oil, and they will use more per seat/mile. of course, tax income was not an issue.

Fruit are collected & the oil palms stand for 30 years (longer than any other oilseed plant). Embarrassing & basic, factual errors.

5566 2018-08-28 12:55:29 Got to the dealership at 6:45am to get my oil changed. I was first, three people have left before me. I inquire about my car, “yep we got it” “Yep, you better hurry” was my response.

5571 2018-08-28 12:55:11 Well, we hope energy companies don't pay the fines we impose for oil spills etc. I'd say it's fairly standard to hope that a fine to discourage bad practice isn't collected! The point is to stop the bad practice, not make money

5581 2018-08-28 12:54:03 They have been importing from Canada because our government is stupid and has made it difficult if not impossible to refine our own oil, so u.s. gets our oil at a steep discount at 37 dollars instead of paying 69 dollars . If they lost our crude they could easily replace it

5683 2018-08-28 12:40:49 The oil is strengthening it and nourishes it as well . Don’t do any keratin treatments /blow outs. That will damage hair. Don’t straighten either. I have so much more to say twitter limits me .

5734 2018-08-28 12:34:14 The answer is not banning pipelines, the answer is access to electricity (preferably solar), education (particularly for women) in the developing world & using the power of 20th century oil money to fund 21st century green tech innovation. Canada is too small to impact otherwise.

5828 2018-08-28 12:21:45 Oh you sweet summer child. They blew the heritage fund wide open and stole from the people. Look at what Norway has done with its oil money and how our fund looks like we saved pennies for 44 years. Do some research.

5976 2018-08-28 12:01:39 My brother taught me how to change the oil tonight which was awesome, except you should also be impressed because I faced my minor claustrophobia and crawled under that freaking bus even though my heart beat freaked out. #hardthings #newthings

5994 2018-08-28 11:59:28 Errr, the guys are not there watching 24/7 !!  Quite likely that tankers have been and gone and not been seen by them!!  So how many tankers have already taken oil away is anyone's guess.

6001 2018-08-28 11:57:47 a customer just had a 20 minute conversation with me about how our olive oil tastes fake and how we should bring the discontinued one back, like I make the fucking olive oil or something?

6011 2018-08-28 11:56:52 Do you know how much oil and gas make in subsidies? Also green energy is new and upcoming and is a 7 trillion dollar market between new jobs in skilled trade and industrial and manufacturing jobs. Do you want a piece of that pie or a declining oil and gas industry?
6012 2018-08-28 11:56:48 The American Evangelicals are almost exactly the same system of elitist ideology Jesus railed against in his day. Schisters getting rich off religion. Just about everyone in that room is a snake oil salesman peddling Christ’s love like cheap soap. 

I hope that was enough for ya
6013 2018-08-28 11:56:42 Thank you Tony....really great to see. Beats my singing..
6014 2018-08-28 11:56:26 Am I really complaining to my SD because I don’t like the quality of the olive oil he has? Yes
6015 2018-08-28 11:56:02 맞는 것 같다

6019 2018-08-28 11:55:02 Wouldn't it be great if Alberta could do a discrete  bilateral agreement with the US outside the auspices of the Fed government? Maybe for energy ie,  oil, gas and coal?
6020 2018-08-28 11:53:46 Well the next generation is being screwed by the tax cut.  All of a sudden it seems deficit doesn’t matter.  What many don’t realise is if all the subsidies on  corn and soybeans and oil were dropped, a lot of money would be freed up instead of being wasted on big industries
6021 2018-08-28 11:53:36 You don’t need an oil change, but you need this and that... Oh your total is $228 before tax   HEAD ASS 
6022 2018-08-28 11:53:24 Consequences of decades long over reliance of trade in one commodity - a commodity traded exclusively in #USD and that possibly leads to my conclusion that politically conservative #USA and it’s oil exporting ‘friends’ interests have a hand in fermenting this collapse!

6024 2018-08-28 11:53:12 I have a farm of about 3 Hectares partially filled with #OilPalm in Ondo State and have plans to have it filled up for Massive Oil production. Looking to hv discussions with individuals who are into #OilPalm farming for directives. Kindly RT cc: @gidi_traffic
6025 2018-08-28 11:53:08 Exactly the point. Debates are for finding out candidates’ beliefs. If they’re science deniers that’s all people need to know there. It’s not a science lesson. Knowing they’re either bought by oil or idiots with such a wrong answer is enough.
6026 2018-08-28 11:53:07 Sshhhh don't tell anyone but that's THEIR debt and for Godssake don't mention the £37.3 BILLION that they take from your oil exports and tell you it's an " unkown region " Unknown? Is it feckin North face of Mars ?
6027 2018-08-28 11:53:00 I honestly thought this said boiled oil and was like damn that must have hurt.

But facts I couldn’t agree with this more. Takes away all the scars from the childhood struggles 
6028 2018-08-28 11:52:45 No!  They are not!  Expose the killings and torture. And only share the oil if paid.

6034 2018-08-28 11:52:10 According to the studies you used they compare sunflower oil to coconut oil. Does that mean they are equivalent?
6035 2018-08-28 11:52:02 Not the answer:
Making corps pay living wages is the only solution
Therre is no workaround
Otherwise the US government is just continuing pay subsidies
It increases corp dependence 
opposite direction
decrease corporate dependency on the government&take away oil's giveaways #ASAP

6042 2018-08-28 11:50:58 I think you can buy lantiseptic at most pharmacies and coconut oil is supposed to be not-terrible for that. Or if neither of those are options try some olive oil, add a little honey, and throw in a pinch of tumeric.
6043 2018-08-28 11:50:53 Most cars I buy are too cheap to have FSH. Some have barely been serviced. A look under the oil cap can tell you more than a sheaf of papers sometimes.
6044 2018-08-28 11:50:49 Both Men including Obama were warmongers whose policies and worldview are responsible for the death of millions of Muslims worldwide, including Arabs. Rest in Peace to all the victims of oil wars and western regime change wars across the world.
6045 2018-08-28 11:50:47 Doesn't the veil obscure their line of sight on the road? You'd think that would be way more hazardous than letting women drive in a repressed country of OPEC oil pimps.
6046 2018-08-28 11:50:42 And there are no less than 3 cars. On way home today. 5, and some big oil drums collecting water. Ppl arguing who to ketch di water first.
6047 2018-08-28 11:50:39 Car owners are often reminded about the frequency of certain maintenance procedures. You probably know by heart that an oil change should be done every three months or when you have driven more than 3,000 miles.

6061 2018-08-28 11:47:53 Based on the other options (which I am fully on-board with!) i'm really not expecting director buying due to lock-ins and insider info. If they spud soon (and they're months overdue) I do expect oil... but seriously, WTF is up with #AMER schedule -keeping?
6062 2018-08-28 11:47:40 Adding oil to the fire but hoping the fix is on the way. My @stationhq app keeps crashing on launch. Any chance to get it fixed soon? Or download the previous version somewhere?

6070 2018-08-28 11:45:40 I just slept on the gravel ground at work for 3 hours, welcome to the oil field
6071 2018-08-28 11:45:31 They were very good - got the seasoning just right.... as I recall something like garlic oil, garlic powder, onion powder, celery salt, white pepper and paprika....
6072 2018-08-28 11:45:24 Coconut oil isn’t really cheaper and cost is the big driver. Diesel sourced electricity in remote islands is very costly, often imported in 200l barrels. That is good because it means solar is cost effective, and way better for emissions.

6090 2018-08-28 11:43:09 I know that. It's occupied territory.
The article you linked says Israel and US want the Golan oil.
What I was saying is, what's stopping them? They've occupied it for years.

6094 2018-08-28 11:42:07 Clutching at straws... a selection of other news, THEN director buying? Oil find from next drill? Even if that's what you meant on each count, I still think it won't happen in September.
6095 2018-08-28 11:42:03 Ah, if 2 years, oil won't be the first of your problems...
6096 2018-08-28 11:41:51 Have you got a verified source for these oil revenues? That’s also nominal value not the real value of what it would be today
6097 2018-08-28 11:41:27 How many of these Billions, spent not by @scotgov but by WM for Scotland on common services could we cut from our independent budget? Quite a few, I think. Plus we get £6B more if we put the tax on NS oil back to 2010 level. So not far off a balanced budget.

6149 2018-08-28 11:31:48 It's not that surprising, considering that the figures include investments into mining ventures and oil&gas, particularly offshore, by UK-based companies. Not the kind of investments that Theresa May wants to push I guess.

6202 2018-08-28 11:21:28 It is a good idea for Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan's political leaders to convey their concerns about the political instability of the United States and Turkey to US oil companies that are currently working on petroleum mining in the Caspian Sea...

6225 2018-08-28 11:19:08 Risk management first, saving money second. But as technology progresses you get both. Mining companies love to tell you they purchase commodities like diesel and electricity at “spot” until oil hits $130/barrel and electricity $130/MWh. Then suddenly it’s a national crisis.

He was on the Cairo when it was sunk on the Malta convoy that got the oil to the island. His brother was on a ship that was torpedoed in the Atlantic and Jack died.  Dad was pro-EU.

6290 2018-08-28 11:08:35 Except Iran can't afford to be too mad--if China doesn't buy their oil, they are seriously screwed when sanctions kick in in November. SK, Japan are going to have to reduce buying from Iran-only Chinese banks are insulated from secondary sanctions enough to risk it

6309 2018-08-28 11:06:30 Adam, have you ever laid eyes on an actual oil refinery? Been near one to see the flames and smoke and smell the toxicity? Or even worse, lived near one? There’s lots of uncalculated cost of drilling, transporting, refining, transporting again, and burning.
6310 2018-08-28 11:06:25 Can you teach people about energy transition from coal to renewables like peak oil? When you get told that we must use coal only, ask if coal will last forever, or if we should use it until it runs out? If the answer is no, then you're just discussing when to change.
6311 2018-08-28 11:06:12 I always thought Texas is a state full of oil fields! This is huge achievement! Can you explain a bit the first two first columns what’s on peak and off peak exactly? Is this energy injected in the regular grid? #renewables #ActOnClimate

6320 2018-08-28 11:04:49 No sense #Petrotrin  continues to refine oil making a loss. They will change their business model and focus more on exploration & production. That company is a cash cow for its members. Time to deal with the waste and overpaid employees.

6381 2018-08-28 10:52:36 Have you seen the recent GDP figures yet? For your info, oil price has been stable for about a year now. Why isn’t our economy booming? Are you aware we may very well slip into another recession?

6413 2018-08-28 10:46:58 America could never do that. It's not in their best interest. Kinda how Germany could never afford going to war with Russia because they depend on energy resources. I do believe America is still dependant on Saudi Arabia's oil resources.
6414 2018-08-28 10:46:52 “Oil for the light." ~Exodus 25:6

(1/2) My soul, how much thou needest this, for thy lamp will not long continue to burn without it. Thy snuff will smoke and become an offence if light be gone, and gone it will be if oil be absent.
6415 2018-08-28 10:46:39 This is of no surprise when it is realized that Iran exports 22% of its oil to China, according to The NY Times. China is disruptive to America’s economic fluidity globally, with North Korea being another totalitarian/communist gov. that is held afloat by China’s puppet strings.

6419 2018-08-28 10:45:51 You're wrong. The two are the same when it comes to balancing a glass on both hands and one on the head. The difference is the each dancers of Pandanggo sa Ilaw balances three half glass of rice wine while dancers of Oasiwas balances oil lamps. You can search it on Google.

Past few weeks have seen run up in stocks inspite of underlying macro issues remaining the same, infact possibly may worsen due to Iran oil unavailability. Please don't hold your punches.

6658 2018-08-28 10:00:08 @FMEnvng The worse of illegal oil business is the social and economic long-term impact on the well-being of people @LawalAmodu @BrigGen50 @monosasah @otiveigbuzor @vickieoseudoh

6660 2018-08-28 09:59:41 Lol, Economy dropped from 1.9% to 1.5% is actually a shrink.

I can get you the definition of the word if you mind.

Secondly, dropping when Oil Prices have steadied for a growth you inherited at 6% is a bad thing.

But I know how you Buharists think sha.
6661 2018-08-28 09:59:39 How long until this is re-implemented.... Like those oil donations

Margarine has already been invented lol
6670 2018-08-28 09:58:43 Inflation is cost of living. Again inflation always goes up. Main reason last 12 months is the price if oil on international markets has shot up. $46 to $76. That's not brexit

6681 2018-08-28 09:56:25 As  I understand it they need Naptha to dilute their exceptionally heavy crude and their tar sands in th Orinoco belt are too deep to extract economically. A strike in their oil industry also seemed to have damaged things irrevocably.
6682 2018-08-28 09:56:18 Omfg our hair routines are so similar!!

6688 2018-08-28 09:54:37 It’s how they milk us anyway they can. Oil should be 40$ a barrel and gas should be a buck a gallon, what a dream I’m having.
6689 2018-08-28 09:54:20 Yes I'm also skeptical about the South East and South West too, don't forget how the last election played out. I feel sad about our Oil bro, I saw the sufferings in the Niger Delta region and my heart bled.

6692 2018-08-28 09:54:18 Taking better care of the hair actually. Then my friend sold her oil to me and it has helped. So oil plus protective styling (no braids for me since May) plus keeping the hair constantly moisturised and the difference is clear

6695 2018-08-28 09:53:40 There is a deep sickness in the Venezuelan politicians. Perhaps though Russia is trying to boost Russia's income by destabilising Venezuela in order to cut off the Venezuelan oil supply to the world. Something that will benefit Russia. Russia's ruthless self interest in action.

6702 2018-08-28 09:52:02 Yeah we took land, took livestock, took gold, took diamonds, took oil, took rubber, took lives for centuries, took religions, took mathematics, medicine and astrology.
6703 2018-08-28 09:52:02 Don’t forget unilaterally banning our entire oil and gas industry, at the cost of hundreds of jobs, without waiting for a single piece of advice even from her own cabinet. That’s by far the most anti-capitalist and near on despotic move she’s made to date.

6801 2018-08-28 09:35:09  oh there will be risks, what country has not-apart from Norway whose oil revenue was well managed. Risks for Scotland in eg EFTA will be much fewer than those in post Brexit UK. They will be risks that we choose, not imposed by our neighbour. Come and join us, kettles on

6804 2018-08-28 09:34:12 Total exports 2017: 615.9b of which food 22.1b and whiskey was 4.4b
Meaning food is 3.58% of total exports and Whiskey 0.71% of total UK exports of 2017. I see oil has fallen off the map after the 50% drop in total exports from 62b to 32bgbp.

6831 2018-08-28 09:30:33 Interesting. Thanks for the insight. I have been working off reports as this from various sources: "Its oil revenues account for about 95% of its export earnings. But when the oil price plummeted in 2014, Venezuela was faced with a shortfall of foreign currency."
6832 2018-08-28 09:30:23 The FG applaud the impact the ERGP has had on the non oil sector resulting in a 2.05 present growth but I'm concerned critical sub-sectors like agriculture and manufacturing are not fair well...
6833 2018-08-28 09:30:04 Er, like gravity is a theory? “Some scientists” are paid to pontificate by the oil industry. Please don’t make out that there is anything less than scientific consensus because it’s simply untrue.
6834 2018-08-28 09:29:45 Not all the oil fields in the North Sea are in Scotland,and who provided the money for them to be built in the first place and who is going to be responsible when they become a heap of junk?

7091 2018-08-28 08:36:31 From my new book, Oil and God
The 2 Asads ruined Syria & saddled Alawites, Xtians, & minorities with a terrible legacy. They confirmed that in a religious country like Syria, a non-representative minority regime of 10% is unsustainable. It can't abuse the 75% Sunnis forever.

7093 2018-08-28 08:36:25 Decomposition of EVOO into possibly hazardous compounds starts at lower temperatures than refined olive oil.

7094 2018-08-28 08:36:20 Water, earth, and fire combine (ratio over time) to form ceramic, the three become undifferentiated.
When oil and water separate or when a part is distinguished from its whole, the nature of those things is made clear.

7159 2018-08-28 08:24:20 Aberdeen is an unique case due to its reliance on oil prices. The other 4 are more worrying. Typical, albeit historically weaker, post-industrial economies, very similar to many more bread and butter economies across the UK. Also all in areas subject to post Brexit issues.

7214 2018-08-28 08:14:10 Actually, the problem is both corruption (including among oil suppliers -- see my post above about the IEEFA Report of it) & politics. See post above of an employee of PREPA @canino63 regarding at least one effect of politics at PREPA. So it's both corruption & politics.

7344 2018-08-28 07:51:18 If it’s a tx4 could be where the coolant pipes go into the heater radiator. Look under dash next to brake pedal 2 silver pipes move them see if they leak, if so water runs under carpet or any signs of oil in the cooler bottle ? If so could be core plugs in head.
7345 2018-08-28 07:51:09 5. The scandalous cost of the EU bringing out thousands of pieces of paper about bent bananas, tampon tax and open olive oil bottle is ludicrous.
7346 2018-08-28 07:51:01 Even that Oil prices per barrel come down to half price that was in 2013 in global market, but jumla holds good to increase price up to 11rs. #AccheDin

7348 2018-08-28 07:50:59 We need to look deeper into the stats, Nigeria's import ratio over the last 30 years has been mostly even. Once you remove oil however it is closer to a 10:1 ratio

7356 2018-08-28 07:50:07 Cleaning Tip: If your kitchen surfaces have been covered in grease, squeeze a few drops of oil onto a kitchen towel and wipe it across the offending surface. The grease and grime should wipe off in just one go. #cleaningtip #cleaninghack

7643 2018-08-28 06:53:16 Omelette is the wrong word but I do get what he means. Mayo splits during cooking so the oil would mostly cook off or into the bread and the egg solids would just be left.

7680 2018-08-28 06:48:11 I have seen first hand what intensive farming of Palm Oil has done in Malaysia..I can only imagine what the "vegan" farm would do to the UK. Our countryside has been shaped by mixed farming and hunting, from ancient hunting forests to dairy. From hill sheep to cabbages

7683 2018-08-28 06:48:04 I calculated that global commercial shipping would need about 500 000 km2 of palm oil plantation. Shipping is easy, those engines aren’t nearly as picky about what they eat.
7684 2018-08-28 06:47:59 always scrape the cutting board with the backside of the knife; if the seasoning's seem off, double check that you've added something sour; olive oil has a low smoking point and should be used sparingly for roasting and minimally for frying

7708 2018-08-28 06:43:16 For this pos president, his burial should not be marked. It should be an unmarked undisclosed location buried face down in oil contaminated soil to be forgotten, if possible.

7724 2018-08-28 06:39:57 Because there is no debate, that happened a long time ago. Now you're just repeating what the oil companies told you to say.

7756 2018-08-28 06:34:34 Are you kidding? The rationale is quite obvious: we have already found more oil and gas reserves than we can safely burn even when allowing for adaptation with a 2°C temperature rise. Exploring for more doesn't even have debatable merits at this point.

United has got the money, the manager needs to be backed to upgrade when required.
7777 2018-08-28 06:29:55 I took two midol and that did nothing. I then took an entire dropper of CBD oil and that also did nothing. Fucking god damn I hate periods.

7781 2018-08-28 06:28:44 The Federal Government should deal decisively with oil companies on oil spills on behalf of the communities, people & the environment in oil producing areas as a policy of engagement.

7793 2018-08-28 06:26:07 It's a well thought out system that requires everyone able to pitch in through taxes. Oh, and we nationalized 70% of oil profits through taxes and put the money away for a rainy day. The proceeds from that are important in our national budget. (About $1 Trillion in the fund).

7799 2018-08-28 06:24:12 I really would like to see this #discussion go further, I don’t think these are all the #facts. Printing "no parm oil" on packaging is the easiest thing to do. Many #companies are just doing just that. It doesn’t guarantee any #ethics, but it sure helping with #sales.
7800 2018-08-28 06:24:08 And it ended up with rampant corruption because it left the oil industry nationalised and let everyone take its money.  If Exxon and Chevron had been extracting Venezuelan oil and paying 15% royalties the place would still be rich.

7842 2018-08-28 06:17:44 Coconut oil is a viable solution, but you should add a little honey and granulated sugar to turn it into a scrub.

7867 2018-08-28 06:14:22 You do realise that the sanctions are extremely limited and largely symbolic? When the USA imposed far more wide ranging sanctions on Iran, including banning oil sales, Iran did not collapse into hyperinflation.
7868 2018-08-28 06:14:19 Based on the USA's record over the last decades, I think it's vitally important that New Zealand doesn't find any major oil reserves anywhere within our control.

7904 2018-08-28 06:07:26 None of them . It's a pretty stupid poll, coming from an oil company. You have been victims of non-scientific environmentalist arguments. It is equivalent to a wine or whiskey maker promoting Coca-Cola because it has a drunk uncle in the family.
7905 2018-08-28 06:07:19 Omg, for the last time I’m not talking about entire countries. Yes Saudi Arabia produces more oil than Iraq but it’s oil is scattered around the whole nation, while the majority of Iraq’s oil is found in Basra at 3.5 billion BPD. Making Basra the richest city in the Middle East.

7909 2018-08-28 06:06:29 Natural Gas is very much better than coal and oil and very very efficient. And offshore searching is much more likely to discover gas than oil. Turning you back on it when the rest of the world is not had a price.
7910 2018-08-28 06:06:29 He hasn't done those,  but he has done well... Very well given a huge change in oil price in the international market and world economy.
7911 2018-08-28 06:06:27 After discovering the really nice anti sadness effects of clary sage oil, I'm disappointed that the world is impossibly large and unfathomable to comprehend.

7930 2018-08-28 06:03:02 I believe you but comparing to oil/coal doesn't persuade me that we should pursue it's use. BTW, there are many permits still in existence that can be acted upon to recover oil/gas, should it be found. TBF to govt, the tardiness by OG co's, is not their problem.

7946 2018-08-28 06:00:22 Somewhat unfortunate Mr. Trump takes this position. CAN is very grateful to our US neighbours backed up by $100’s Bs in profit from Canada’s resources. With ⅓ of the World’s oil reserves and the high depletion rates for new US wells, US will soon need CDN oil.

8184 2018-08-28 05:09:16 Why not just end all the expensive subsidies to all the crony industries (like big corn, big sugar, big oil, etc.)? That would be a much more cost effective solution than extorting companies who don’t have so much political pull.

8188 2018-08-28 05:08:49 I give my 14 yr old cat cannabis coconut oil for her feline asthma and various elder ailments. it definitely cuts down on her wheezing. Rub it right on her. It absorbs in and she licks it.

8191 2018-08-28 05:08:40 i know oil & shit was very important and codified, but what about even deeper. is the magma mine to use for generating dangerous amounts of energy to fuel my crypto currency operation
8192 2018-08-28 05:08:32 Don't let this distract you from the fact that there's a gang of Asian gangsters that torture ppl by making them drink motor oil only to gain information on the where abouts on premium Nissan SR20 engines.
8193 2018-08-28 05:08:32 Oil is just buttered water

8197 2018-08-28 05:07:50 and coconut oil is just fat (and saturated fat at that)
8198 2018-08-28 05:07:45 Now you know why the US wants to control Iran, it is all about the transport of oil.
8199 2018-08-28 05:07:29 Some things I've touched: laparoscopic surgery simulation, reservoir viz (oil&gas or co2 storage), viz of large process plants, 3d viz of multibeam echosounder data over bathymetry data (runs in some research and large fishing vessels), combo viz of bathymetry, safe zones, tidals

8203 2018-08-28 05:06:47 1. If Petro Canada was still a thing, Canadians would be rich. 

2. Letting the Chinese and Malaysian royals own the oil sands is not better than the crown owning it. 

3. Obviously Trudeau’s gameplan is to build the pipeline and then sell it... to someone like the Saudis.
8204 2018-08-28 05:06:36 Where did you buy your oil? I'm struggling to get it
8205 2018-08-28 05:06:13 And even tho the US is an oligarchy, it's easier to get an involved than a company. I mean if there are an oil spill and people protest, chances are the government is going to make the company step down due to pressure.

8335 2018-08-28 04:39:19 Wha day ya shi sey oil is pointless and may cause more problems especially if it is that you feel your hair/scalp is dry. Same for combing it out before washing. I doan do dat. She said the best time to detangle is when it's wet and we bout to/are shampooing and conditioning.
8336 2018-08-28 04:39:13 @JohnGoodenUK morning John, could you recommend a company to buy CBD oil from at all? I want to make sure I get a good one as they can be expensive.
8337 2018-08-28 04:39:08 Who spends billions on OPEC? You would think an Albertan would understand the oil industry

8360 2018-08-28 04:34:59 I can't wait until KSA runs out of that last drop of oil. They will have nothing else to offer the world.
8361 2018-08-28 04:34:29 gonna start tapering off klonopin now that i have all this cbd oil....really really REALLY hoping this works 
8362 2018-08-28 04:34:06 Does 3+ B in oil and gas industry subsidies count? Your truck or Hyundai isn’t subsidized but the fuel you put in it is, no?That any different? Oh, if it’s a Chrysler, did they not receive 85 million in grants/subsidies? Maybe I’m wrong or have bad info. Just putting it out there
8363 2018-08-28 04:34:04 Feel a #coldsore coming on? Dab the spot with tea tree oil, nail polish remover or even vodka....these can prevent it from blossoming

8388 2018-08-28 04:30:14 That's the dilemma. Definitely going lower if oil goes lower, but if not, this is the place to get long imo.
8389 2018-08-28 04:30:11 Odds on the ice cream maker are actually pretty good. Sesame oil etc is definitively the kiss of death
8390 2018-08-28 04:30:07 I'm just SURE Putin preferred Trump over Killary. Even tho she VOWED to break the oil. Gas and coal industry which was only GOOD news to Putin. Yeah, that makes sense. Dummys

8392 2018-08-28 04:29:59 I totally agree that things are coming along and the combination of the various boosts in solar cells is one of the best bets out there but we will never acheive this by shutting down oil.
When it's effective and effective enough it will take over. Commerce will demand it.

8400 2018-08-28 04:27:50 I think that the story here a little complicated.
In the 50s and 60s , Israel was against the SA regime.
But, after the 1973 war, the Arab world started an Embargo on Israel. Using their power as oil suppliers they enforced huge sanctions.
Israel's relationships in Africa stopped

8417 2018-08-28 04:24:03 cbd oil isn’t hemp oil sis.
8418 2018-08-28 04:23:54 on a bit of a tangent but seriously if you suffer from migraines, muscle, or nerve pain and you are a marijuana sceptic (like me), consider CBD oil before OTC medication. Before this only muscle relaxers were helping which was really scary !!!

8478 2018-08-28 04:14:53 The natural acids in our skin that produce moisture. It’s necessary because our skin loses HA as we get older. So when you combine those two + a LITTLE oil (like 2 drops of jojoba oil), you get a very dewy glow + soft skin 
8479 2018-08-28 04:14:51 @SenatorCantwell In 1959 nobody though that Castro a banana tyrant would dominate Venezuela, Nicaragua, Bolivia and would be a nuclear threat.  Today USA, Europe, Israel… close their eyes to the great danger that is Maduro-RedKorea-Iran-narco whith the biggest oil world reserve

8481 2018-08-28 04:14:30 In my view, the Panel erred in saying that while a large tanker oil spill would significantly impact orcas, such a spill was unlikely. Quite simply, the Panel either didn’t understand, or chose to ignore, the statistics presented to it. There’s a significant risk of a big spill.
8482 2018-08-28 04:14:09 @TamraBarney for Eddies blood clots, since he hates his meds, 'Black Seed Oil' & maybe even 'Flax Seed Oil,' is an option. You should look into it.

8541 2018-08-28 04:02:12 Never used aloe. I like coconut oil! But be careful using it in the winter or it’ll dry up white. Also, it sometimes made my scalp super itchy. But I liked it because it really moisturized my hair.

Try some raw shea butter or Jamaican black castor oil.

8756 2018-08-28 03:30:24 避難する時の合言葉「おかしも」は押さない、駆けない、喋らない、戻らないですが、浮気がバレた時の「おかしも」はオドオドしない、固まらない、しらばっくれない、もうどうにもならない、です。
8757 2018-08-28 03:30:24 overheard at SLC while boarding DL flight to IAD -- "yeah, I work on Bill Frist's staff, yeah, we are getting our oil and gas stuff done in the Southern part of the state, the pay stinks right now, but I will be set for life in another year or two." -- quotes of corruption
8758 2018-08-28 03:29:54 U need to google and read Shell Oil report on effects of their business model and warming the earth, it’s a very educational read.
8759 2018-08-28 03:29:42 @JimInhofe what kind of IDIOT are you? Repealing the clean power act was  necessary? WHAT you got oil stock? THIS ORANGE pos in the WHITE HOUSE is going to kill us ALL. No respect for the war hero McCain and no respect for the planet. #gophasgottogo
8760 2018-08-28 03:29:41 He realy needs to cut all aid to these people. Why do we give them money anyway they will just hate us even moreover. It's like given them welfare here cut the crap. Their leaders have just as many oil rights as any of the other Middle East countries.

8762 2018-08-28 03:29:22 @realDonaldTrump is a classless, degenerate, lying lowlife, orange, crass, vile, charlatan, snake oil salesman, and overall assclown.
8763 2018-08-28 03:29:14 I feel like my apartment still smells like french fry oil & it’s bothering me
8764 2018-08-28 03:29:05 I just talked to someone at Sephora about it drying up! She said to put a few drops of Aragon oil in it!
8765 2018-08-28 03:28:29 Agree. We all know Brady is not going to answer questions regarding the snake oil salesman. Instead of losing the interview all together, ask some football questions. He sure af isnt going break news on Kirk and Callahan
8766 2018-08-28 03:28:29 she doesn’t even know what type pads we buy or what type motor oil her car uses . grown my ass
8767 2018-08-28 03:28:26 Jatamansi (an essential oil) diluted and rubbed on your temples should do the trick. It works for me during my rougher patches!

What has he delivered? 
 So the question is,
Was he lying? Is he incompetent? Is he an agent?
8771 2018-08-28 03:28:07 @PypProducts Bought your virgin coconut oil (dt of manuf 01/18) and it was reeking and spoilt. I was very surprised & disappointed. What should I do?

8773 2018-08-28 03:28:00 i had a very vivid dream i was doing ketamine with elon musk at burning man last night i think thanks to some combination of preworkout and cbd oil
8774 2018-08-28 03:27:47 And hell, when I got back from PMC, I heard a lot of reports about the bicep swivels breaking. Mine were fine, but I wanted the added insurance so, I got some of my 80-Shock-Oil & shoved it into the swivel. Problem solved.
8775 2018-08-28 03:27:46 They dare not touch those OIC, Saudi, Yemen, Turkey, and Syria. UN is useless and controlled by Islamic countries and oil money. They support Islamization and want an Islamic state in #Rakhine for #Terrorist #Roshitgya #Bengali.
8776 2018-08-28 03:27:36 Use coconut oil!

8787 2018-08-28 03:25:21 Dry newspaper means you can use it to get Rainy day special oil free samosas and pakodas..
8788 2018-08-28 03:25:08 Lol rapping, school and changing oil ain’t for everybody 
8789 2018-08-28 03:25:05 You see what happens when you buy invisible oil?
8790 2018-08-28 03:24:36 Bubble bath, candles, the Master & Commander score, coconut oil, and positive affirmations. 
8791 2018-08-28 03:24:05 Even further you can drop the chicken in a fry daddy, or some people will only use cast iron skillets with enough oil to cook half the chicken so you have to flip it once. Old schoolers do cast iron. Like I said it’s art, but as long as you like it that’s all that matters
8792 2018-08-28 03:24:04 The 1% elite in many of these African countries are quite happy to sell out their fellow countrymen for a few handouts from the multinational oil and mining companies.
8793 2018-08-28 03:23:49 I lost my satellite lock some time ago :( Don't know where I am now and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
8794 2018-08-28 03:23:31 Now playing: 'BEDS ARE BURNING' by 'MIDNIGHT OIL'
8795 2018-08-28 03:23:30 Recently found out Genealogy has nothing to do with magic oil lamps or wishes. Little disappointed.
8796 2018-08-28 03:23:17 Peppermint oil is a life saver, game changer, gift from god
8797 2018-08-28 03:23:17 And a new NAFTA deal, NATO nations finally paying their way, new trade deal with S Korea, Texas for the first time in a very long time a net exporter of oil, projected 4.6+ growth GDP in this quarter, 500,000 manufacturing jobs back in the US, shall I go on?

8799 2018-08-28 03:23:00 To go into public? Or make a video whilst changing the oil?
those things need to be clarified

8804 2018-08-28 03:22:40 just dropped my entire bank account on an oil change, new brake pads, disney pass, books, and my parking permit 
8805 2018-08-28 03:22:37 This beard oil is different than the others I bought.

8808 2018-08-28 03:22:14 Like there’s a difference b/w saying “why don’t you try this expensive essential oil it cured my nephew of autism” + saying “when I was caught in a destructive cycle it helped me to have a basic self care routine, you could start by just trying to go outside for a bit every day”
8809 2018-08-28 03:22:13 I wonder how they ran their operations when oil was > $100

8811 2018-08-28 03:21:44 With falling ₹ and rising crude oil, finance ministry and petrochem.  ministry should  have discussed about how to reduce cost. so that  inflation does not go out of hand. @dpradhanbjp @arunjaitley
8812 2018-08-28 03:21:36 およ？雷？
8813 2018-08-28 03:21:35 Gonna try putting castor oil on my face nightly and see what happens
8814 2018-08-28 03:21:16 Hada labo walaupun  pricey sikit tapi boleh tahan up to 6-7 months. Toner (59 hengget), cleanser (32), oil cleanser (39) sampai setengah tahun sooo???? Less than 200 untuk nak dekat setengah tahun normal kot??? Byeeee
8815 2018-08-28 03:20:49 Since I knew that I didn't increase a lot of weight, it was a problem of scale, and I didn't want to dieting any more, less sugar less oil less carbohydrates no snack no coke... In the past two weeks, I have been worried about eating one more grain of rice
8816 2018-08-28 03:20:43 After enjoying eucalyptus oil body massage, the migrants had the option of tennis or yoga.
8817 2018-08-28 03:20:32 I think invoking Section 232 tariffs based on “security” concerns isn’t consistent with NAFTA agreement or with asking Canada to supply oil as demanded by NAFTA. Those tariffs are harming my family and my neighbors — you support them then don’t come to me when you need something.
8818 2018-08-28 03:20:32 In the kitchen waiting for this oil to get hot because I’m hungry and I’m seriously about to fry fish at approx. 11:35pm.
8819 2018-08-28 03:20:11 It sucks always being the one fixing things between us when youre just adding more oil to the fire
8820 2018-08-28 03:20:07 But politicians that have unlimited funding from oil companies won’t change anybody. Need to improve education. Which requires overturning citizens united and getting more liberals in power to improve curriculum.
8821 2018-08-28 03:20:05 Early midnight oil for me
8822 2018-08-28 03:20:01 What a fucking oil barrel across my feed
8823 2018-08-28 03:19:53 But when you’re not consuming hella oil, salt, sugar, butter, you will feel the difference in your body.
8824 2018-08-28 03:19:53 Just heard a radio commercial for some snake oil "male enhancement" pill. The commercial said it's like "viagra on steroids".  That strikes me as a potentially dangerous drug interaction.
8825 2018-08-28 03:19:44 I have to free ball tonight.  I don’t feel like wearing pants or underwear . Imma just oil my body and put a T-shirt on.
8826 2018-08-28 03:19:21 GOAT-level machining. Also, wow, oil dispensing for machining has come a long way in 40 years.
8827 2018-08-28 03:19:16 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
8828 2018-08-28 03:18:52  I don't clean rooms. I fix things. Unlike you who cant fix the oil leak in his car 
8829 2018-08-28 03:18:46 You forget EM is God These are acts of the oil companies or other car companies (ramping up their EV sC) AsACult Tesla can redefine things
8830 2018-08-28 03:18:45 Haha Oil Up!

8833 2018-08-28 03:18:34 Put coconut oil in my beard...if I don't wake up beautiful I'm suing somebody!!!
8834 2018-08-28 03:18:25 The tea tree oil is messing up my nose but it’s literally the only way I can keep my nose piercing from getting infected.
8835 2018-08-28 03:18:23 John, each season awakens an environment for new parasites to thrive. Crap coins are the snake oil of tech. A fool and their money have always been soon parted.
8836 2018-08-28 03:18:17 Anybody on here is use castor oil ?
8837 2018-08-28 03:17:53 I used acrylic on top of oil ! I'm surprised with how how fast it dried up and how it's not peeling off and dhsnushskajs I mean at least educate yourself a little on the subject your trying to talk about than go off in a whole fucking lecture knowing that89% your sayin is wrong
8838 2018-08-28 03:17:50 A nice bubble bath & rub down with coconut oil would do your body goodt.
8839 2018-08-28 03:17:46 Oil naik lg nih bang...

8842 2018-08-28 03:16:54 Tapenade has every ingredient I love, namely olives, capers, and olive oil.  Thank you both for highlighting this appetising spread for the avid consumer.
8843 2018-08-28 03:16:18 Yes, that's a real head scratcher. Is it about money? Have they been bribed? How the Republican Party could go from a party of principles to being the party of a lying orange snake oil salesman is a real mystery to everyone. #ImpeachTrump #VoteBlue #GOP #BlueWave #Basta
8844 2018-08-28 03:16:16 You talking about the same John McCain that was my Arizona Senator? He was a pawn of the oil companies a war monger and an insult to vets. He voted against any benefit to vets. He was a giant hypocrite.

8846 2018-08-28 03:16:08 $NEPT is THE move with catalysts that will drive share value (& profit) through the roof. Production+sales licenses incoming.. partnership with now-loaded $CGC (buyout???).. clinical trials for CBD+Krill Oil delivery models.. IP.. Will make world-class CBD softgels that will SELL
8847 2018-08-28 03:16:04 Yep that sounds about right. “But sure, totally should be able to buy a house, he just needs to burn that midnight oil more!” 
8848 2018-08-28 03:15:53 “Mind-altering drugs” is a category which is sufficiently broad as to be essentially meaningless. And you’re assuming a great deal about why people make use of cannabis or it’s related products. My brother and mother use CBD oil to ease back pain and arthritis, respectively.
8849 2018-08-28 03:15:47 I made some bomb ass body scrub/exfoliate; subbed aloe vera gel in for a carrier oil. Still added a few essential oils and a flower extract. SKIN TOO BOMB!!!
8850 2018-08-28 03:15:45 Cool oil lamp
8851 2018-08-28 03:15:34 To meet this extreme water scarcity we need to establish a proper channel sytem like Oil and Petrolium being supplied from one country to another. We have technology to convert sea water to drinking water through specific purification. And it could be supplied to pipelines.
8852 2018-08-28 03:15:34 I’m not insinuating anything just stating that Canada agreed to a clause in NAFTA that required we supply US oil regardless of National need. that’s just a fact. But you see it goes both ways — the US can’t both depend on Canada and shaft them on trade at the same time.
8853 2018-08-28 03:15:18 I am sitting in my car in line for gas at Costco and my gasoline empty oil light is on and I am real scared
8854 2018-08-28 03:15:18 So you are not a Scientist. So you are not an Inventor So you never went to University                             So you never lived in the 70s  to know what was said first hand                                      So you don’t remember that we were running out of oil in the 90s
8855 2018-08-28 03:15:17 Any of those oils will work. If you want to use it for your face just use the vitamin e, apricot, or sweet almond oil instead of the heavier oils.
The oils I named for your face are lighter and won’t clog up your pores like the oils I suggest for your lips.
8856 2018-08-28 03:15:00 Bingo. It does look like oil. I'll say that.
8857 2018-08-28 03:14:52 Rise in interest-rates, weak-rupee sharp increase in prices of Base Metals & Crude oil &gas, will massively increase input cost hence hurt corporate profits, despite weakness in INR Indian currency still expensive against all developing nations currency will further slow exports,
8858 2018-08-28 03:14:42 Commodities Trading Results (B) - Brent oil:-

8862 2018-08-28 03:14:05 Took a bubble bath with lavender rosemary lemongrass and extra coconut oil so I didn’t have to lotion, did a clay mask also. Much needed
8863 2018-08-28 03:13:56 This makes perfect sense. Kill 3k of your own people to start a war then you don’t take the oil reserves, you don’t expand your land and your people die In conflict in countries that you get nothing in return. It’s so obvious.
8864 2018-08-28 03:13:52 I can't believe that the big oil co. Want run a pipeline thru our state. God bless Texas, why destroy the beauty of our great state. The Tinman robotgene batteries not included.

8873 2018-08-28 03:11:22 Oh...so it got mixed in with the oil?  Good thing it wasn’t something that was actually toxic like an insecticide or something.  The oil is probably more toxic than the glyphosate...

I think they might.

8908 2018-08-28 03:05:18 I thought that was driven by Zinke. I'm.sure all the help this employee gave the oil companies was a good quid pro quo
8909 2018-08-28 03:05:04 Instead of meat 1layer of fried sciced eggplants, onion, cheese, potato slices & repeat. Olive oil & garlic. Top off with sharp cheese & bake

8936 2018-08-28 02:59:40 Actually the grift is this. People like Alex Jones in addition to being a literal snake oil salesman sells the data of the morons who buy his junk. All the grifters do. It’s their biggest profit center because it’s all profit. So all you need is a product and a list and it’s $.

8939 2018-08-28 02:59:02 Completely disagree, as we Indians (Specifically Keralites)have been using coconut oil since ages for cooking #healthycoconutoil
8940 2018-08-28 02:59:01 So glad I finally got some more hair oil. My hair is thanking me for it, it feels so soft.
8941 2018-08-28 02:58:59 What’s fair is fair; you block the pipeline, you can be the first people declined the privelage of buying products made with oil -like that phone you are recording on, or that rain coat you’re wearing, or the car you drove to get there. So, yeah, sit up on your high-horse.

8951 2018-08-28 02:57:11 U misunderstand. Canada produces about 4 million barrels of OIL per day. About 3 million BPD is sent to the USA. the USA uses our oil. World oil demand increases 1 million BPD/yr ... Canada is an insignificant producer of GHG
8952 2018-08-28 02:57:09 Much like Trump I wish you & your brother would go away. You're not serious journalists. You're snake oil salesmen just like he is.

8956 2018-08-28 02:56:36 EXPRESS￼

THE Government has decided to shut down the refinery of State oil company Petrotrin.

The country can no longer afford to continue to refine oil and lose billions of dollars in this process, a senior Cabinet source told the Express yesterday.

8964 2018-08-28 02:54:55 Heat up water and then add a spoonful of honey and 2-3 drops of teatree oil. No more than 3 because it is very strong and potentially toxic

8978 2018-08-28 02:53:29 Trump is creating jobs that the US should not want (logging, oil/petroleum), not to mention that his tariffs may be helping jobs like mining, but are going to eventually negatively impact companies that rely on buying things like steel for their products.
8979 2018-08-28 02:53:26 I like how the background kind of looks like oil. But keep going! Definitely! It looks super fun

8988 2018-08-28 02:52:07 Charcoal face wash and beard oil before bed was a very bad idea. 

I look and feel too good just to go to sleep.
8989 2018-08-28 02:52:06 America destroyed the Venezuelan economy because they want their oil. Same reason they destroyed Iraq. Same reason they're after Syria. They suck oil like vampires suck blood.

8997 2018-08-28 02:50:52 While carbon tax is THEORETICALLY a decent disincentive, the Libs fail to ENSURE it works that way. B/c a province is still free to reinvest carbon taxes collected back into oil & gas industry if they choose. So much for disincentive. Gotta appease those western separatists.
8998 2018-08-28 02:50:50 I used to weigh 600 lbs (I’m 6’7” and worked on the docks pulling in oil tankers so not the typical 600) and I’m down to 490 now. Still working on it and you definitely provided me some inspiration, as you have in various ways since I was in junior high.

9044 2018-08-28 02:43:53 I once had a dream that I spilt olive oil under my bed and that the only way to fix it was vampirism.

6 The faction in the USA so annoyed with "elites selling out our country" are going to claim more pie for themselves. Restricting trade is the LEAST PAINFUL way to do this.
9066 2018-08-28 02:39:44 THE Government has decided to shut down the refinery of State oil company Petrotrin.The country can no longer afford to continue to refine oil and lose billions of dollars in this process, a senior Cabinet source told the Express yesterday.

9076 2018-08-28 02:38:20 you could also spritz those fries or anything you put in the air fryer with a small amount of olive oil (they should sell it in those special spray type bottles) so you get your essential omega oils :)

9079 2018-08-28 02:38:13 I wash it in a wire strainer under cold water, rubbing it with my hands to release the starchy outer layer. I heat up a sauce pan with a bit of oil and then I add the rice straight from the strainer and sauté it, stirring continually.

Once again doing the same for the other blade

9094 2018-08-28 02:35:13 Yes. Also, pls explain HOW new pipelines blowing hole in deficit, pumping fossil fuels to be burned that WILL WORSEN climate change, and INCREASE response costs, are 'proactive' or cost-effective. Do YOU plan to have oil corps pay costs? Or just keep subsidizing them?

9104 2018-08-28 02:33:25 Texans cannot let the liberals take over the great state of Texas. If they do, you’ll have regulations, out the wahzoo on oil and gas,  a high state income tax, programs you can’t pay for, an attack on the 2nd amendment rights, etc.

9107 2018-08-28 02:33:02 (also, I am a convert to air frying. you can't do large batches, but these fries came out SO fucking crispy. Only downside is there's no flavor from the oil, but the texture matters more to me anyway in the case of fries)

9132 2018-08-28 02:27:36 This oil diffuser is my best purchase to date
9133 2018-08-28 02:27:34 and maybe hair oil and there are some other things you can do and if none of that works you could ask a doctor maybe

9135 2018-08-28 02:27:29 Yeah my old roommate would make them. I think she just sprinkles S&P and olive oil, and bakes them. I can text her for the deets if you’d like
9136 2018-08-28 02:27:22 You have never read my articles, apparently, exposing the many problems on THE REZ, exposing the injustices done to Indigenous people by a corrupt govt, the “man camps in” the oil fields.

9142 2018-08-28 02:26:34 Cool. I been doing the lotion thing for years. But get this for a tip. Try with a baby oil. Especially gold when u are tanned or ice    On..
9143 2018-08-28 02:26:30 Too bad, they along with their oil should go home. That’s a 1,000 positions that CanadianS should fill.

9151 2018-08-28 02:25:12 The job losses were the direct result of the mid-2014 plummet in global oil prices. Jobs were lost worldwide. Capital expenditure also declined because big oil sands projects were largely completed and no new ones commenced because of low/volatile oil prices.

9161 2018-08-28 02:23:50 ... okay but CBD oil is totally different from "medical marijuana" & this is misleading and inaccurate. Virginia has not yet legalized "medical marijuana."
9162 2018-08-28 02:23:42 A friend (respiratory therapist) shared her solution, it's half my solution.  I've noticed many soaps strip too much oil from my hands, so it's Dove unless it's something greasy, and her trick is wash only in COLD water. Works like a charm for me. Only need lotion once in awhile.
9163 2018-08-28 02:23:07 "Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!"

9165 2018-08-28 02:22:46 Very pleased with your position on Environmental issues on climate control. America should lead the way, also create many thousands of jobs, more so than oil and coal is presently. Gun control is important. Education and health affects everyone. Interesting manifesto!
9166 2018-08-28 02:22:44 My firm didnt do currency trading. We outsourced it to prime broker for balancing requirements.
But i noticed on very predictable band of USD movement against major currencies. Its like,  kalau tak tamak, go level by level, confirm buat duit. 

Oil & Gas much more complicated.
9167 2018-08-28 02:22:43 Both are a separate medium making comparisons difficult, as both evoke their own distinct feels. Its like comparing oil, acrylic, watercolor, ink or markers to each other.
9168 2018-08-28 02:22:41 Lavender oil mixed in coconut oil definitely helps chafing. You’re welcome
9169 2018-08-28 02:22:39 I said the same thing when I left the army to start contracting.. then the price of oil dropped 
9170 2018-08-28 02:22:39 I hope Trump breaks up these monopolies.  Remember when they broke up Standard Oil?...  they all actually got even more rich, but it was the principal of the thing.
9171 2018-08-28 02:22:33 Too much oil. The bombs would rain down on our heads.
9172 2018-08-28 02:22:31 What's the trade deal? What changed? What happened? Why are there zero actual details on this?

9177 2018-08-28 02:21:52 what kind of oil.
9178 2018-08-28 02:21:51 How about ‘why we dropped the oil and gas’ bombshell. Bet that wasn’t mentioned, let alone the 170 odd working groups.  Falling dollar? Peters and Jones splashing the cash?  Transparency? Documents requested under OIA with all 70 pages redacted?
9179 2018-08-28 02:21:43 i’ve done this too many times..worst is getting oil of the hot pepper on contacts and having it happen all over again
9180 2018-08-28 02:21:40 Like the kind of hate and ignorance that leads someone to call people you dropped napalm on a racial slur, oppose the MLK holiday, want to bomb every middle eastern country except a monarchy that sells oil.

The disgusting part is that Dems are being respectful to that monster.

9222 2018-08-28 02:14:40 Among the sectors, Oil & Gas (34%), Power and  Telecom (33%  each) have witnessed reasonable rollovers compared to the  other sectors  on the D-3. High rollovers were seen in IHFL (51%), ARBP  (48%) and  HDFC (47%).
9223 2018-08-28 02:14:22 Different situation too.  That’s terrorism.  They control the population by terror.

The money must come from oil, somehow.  Dunno.
9224 2018-08-28 02:14:17 Mungkin sebab palm oil dan biodiesel antara aset dan punca ekonomi Malaysia. Negara kita pun antara pengeluar terbesar palm oil. So, keuntungan negara datang dari situ. Kita tak boleh buat apa pun. Itu pendapat saya jelah.
9225 2018-08-28 02:14:12 Making a decision between taking this time while the boys are asleep to also sleep or to take a relaxing epsom salt and cocoanut oil bath with a face mask is such a struggle.

9312 2018-08-28 02:02:16 The irony that you’d compare us to Venezuela while you support a man who relies on oil and gas lobbies is rich. Venezuela’s financial issues are connected with oil & gas; ffs, no one is voting for communism.

9321 2018-08-28 02:00:54 家族は仲良くて幸いだったけれど、ナンパやキャッチが多くて迷惑という話をすると、「他人から見ても女として魅力がある」認識だから、そこはもう理解されないんだなって諦めてる。痴漢も盗撮も嫌がらせも日常だったことを伝えても思い過ごしだといわれる苦さよ
9322 2018-08-28 02:00:46 Blend 1 pound barley with 3 pints chimichanga. Mix into  Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve on salad

9327 2018-08-28 02:00:17 @madisoncole420 Hi Madison! I wanted to tell you about the products that we have been working on for 2 1/2 years. The Tincture, the Holy oil, and the Extreme oil. There is nothing like this out there. The truth about cannabis medicinal properties has been buried too long.
9328 2018-08-28 02:00:14 Arguably the worst part of this oil debacle is that i'll be driving my mom's Toyota FJ until the truck is fixed or pronounced dead. Y'all dont understand how much i hate this useless bloated hunk of an SUV.
9329 2018-08-28 02:00:12 If I don’t do anything else, ima get my oil changes from Hyundai regularly and keep my tires rotated on time. This whole “don’t take care of a car I pay monthly for” mess is wildddd lol
9330 2018-08-28 02:00:05 More GOP snake oil. Drink all of it.  Oh, I forgot:  Con artists don't drink their own patent medicine.  They just sell it to their dupes in the Bayou State.  #corruptoldparty #timeisrunningout
9331 2018-08-28 02:00:01 Inhofe of OK is bought and owned by big oil. Not too bright, either. He threw the snowball to deny climate change.
9332 2018-08-28 01:59:57 Memo to Dodger Fam! I have to force myself to root for the Evil Hated Cheating Giants to Beat the Classless D-Backs!!! It’s like rooting for Wall Street & Big Oil companies!
9333 2018-08-28 01:59:55 I love goin to these swanky ice cream parlors n ordering Neapolitan they’re like sorry sir we have olive oil duckskin dream instead & I’m like mint chocolate chip? they’re like no we have star anise raisin sheepsmilk but im like bubble gum pls! they’re all we have kumquat jubilee
9334 2018-08-28 01:59:55 Absorbs the oil and decreases burning/skin irritation
9335 2018-08-28 01:59:51 Still concerned how McDonald’s intends on creating a McVegan but their fries are still cooked in beef oil??? Uhhhhh
9336 2018-08-28 01:59:44 Amazing day at the Garage... We almost got everything done... 2 fuel pumps, Tires, Alignments, numerous oil and filter services and State Inspections... Thanks Billy and We missed Richard
9337 2018-08-28 01:59:23 The petrochemical profits go in Swiss bank accounts of Koch Bros and other Big Oil executives.
9338 2018-08-28 01:59:12 Jobs? What weight oil made sense for what application, back in the 70s. Also, how to rebuild a carburetor.
9339 2018-08-28 01:59:09 SO LIKE when i ate meat i didn't just "eat meat" & like order "grilled chicken on a salad w oil & vinegar" & shit i ate fuckin 5 inch thick salami gabagool sangwiches DAILY til i was a full ass, 22 year old Tony Sopranette. I NEED TO BE THIS WAY OR I'LL DIE ALONE IN A ROMAN HOTEL
9340 2018-08-28 01:59:05 @WhitlockJason it’s paid appearance my dude. He was OK with the media when he was doing all these interviews in the summer time about his snake oil bullshit TB 12 crap. While the book pushes selling his products. Morphing into tom cruise Scientology
9341 2018-08-28 01:58:50 Just putting gas in it and going lol. They don’t listen to the far check the oil or none of that.
9342 2018-08-28 01:58:50 病院2時間待ちで おこ。
9343 2018-08-28 01:58:31 Vote NO to @RonDeSantisFL   He will not have the best interest of middle class. Will not help with healthcare, education, environment issues, will support off shore oil rigs- will hurt are beaches & tax cuts that work against middle class. Floridians can do better.
9344 2018-08-28 01:58:31 Mexican leaders want Canada to stay in #NAFTA. But sealed their own deal first.  President Elect #AMLO praised #DonaldTrump for respecting Mexico's oil & energy independence saying Mexico will be allowed to reform energy laws. "Our recommendation was taken into consideration."
9345 2018-08-28 01:58:30 1859: The first successful oil well is drilled in Titusville, Pennsylvania. #thisdayinhistory
9346 2018-08-28 01:58:28 WE the MAJORITY WILL BE TALKING ABOUT HEALTHCARE,SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE!! CLIMATE CHANGE!! WE WILL BE VOTING BLUE IN 70 DAYS!
NO MORE gop rule! NO MORE BLOOD MONEY TAKERS,BIG OIL AND BIG PHARMA PAYOFFS, NO EPA!! ENOUGH!!
9347 2018-08-28 01:58:20 比留間さん誕生日おめでとう
9348 2018-08-28 01:58:05 Thank you CA Assembly for passing SB 834 and making sure there is no oil drilling off our beautiful CA coast!  Now time for the CA Senate to do the same and follow the will of the people.
9349 2018-08-28 01:58:00 An incredible amount of bipartisan government ethics work got done.  Oh and an oil revenue windfall directed back at Alaskans.
9350 2018-08-28 01:57:55 Yet your boss Scheer was suggesting we stop sending them cheap oil.
9351 2018-08-28 01:57:37 I think they hire anyone lol. Cause my sister has the new crv and when she took it for an oil change they didn't screw the bolt on right. So when she was on the fwy it fell and spilled all the oil 
9352 2018-08-28 01:57:33 Yeah, I guess when they did this in the late 1850s, germ theory was nascent. I was mildly surprised to find out when petroleum jelly was discovered. I have no scale of history when it comes to how the oil industry evolved. Like, in my mind, the 19th century = whale oil.
9353 2018-08-28 01:57:29 All Trump is,  wishing he was Half the Man John McCain was..A War Hero who suffered for Years..Being attached by a Snake Oil Salesman who got his Daddy to help him get DEFERMENTS to The SAME place that Brave Patriot SERVED and Suffered..

Thank you Jim for being a Great Reporter

9356 2018-08-28 01:56:58 ライブ見たくて泣いている
9357 2018-08-28 01:56:40 Get some peppermint oil. Rub it where the pain is. This is the best thing I’ve found to help relieve the pain. 

*Do NOT rub it near the eyes, they will water like crazy!
9358 2018-08-28 01:56:32 I intend to use RSO style cannabis oil daily as a preventative medicine and I believe this is my human right. For this to be possible and affordable I need to grow my own. I think next spring I'll take the risk and plant out my garden.
@sajidjavid #cannabis #Marijuana
9359 2018-08-28 01:56:29 Please save this valuable ecosystem. It may be needed as other corals die from global warning. Der drumpf does not get to damage it for 2 years worth of oil.
9360 2018-08-28 01:56:25 IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE LIKE, THE STORE BOUGHT SHIT IF IT MATTERS TO YOU JUST MIX SOME BAKING SODA AND ESSENTIAL OILS WITH COCONUT OIL AND RUB IT ON YOUR PITS AND WIPE YOUR GENITALS WITH WATER AND SOAP AT LEAST EVERY DAY
9361 2018-08-28 01:56:25 People have diff approaches towards healing.For example today my wife is in the hospital doped up on every opioid known to man, this time next week she will be on CBD oil /yoga/rest.There isn’t one way to fix things, anti Guerrero buzz mostly comes from pill distribution networks
9362 2018-08-28 01:56:19 This black gurl said she ain’t mixed wit nun but black, dirt, & oil 
9363 2018-08-28 01:56:00 Well, the wheels fell of one of my trucks and hit a car.
Then everyone started pilling on with damage.
I loved the guy that took a hatchet to his oil pan.
9364 2018-08-28 01:55:42 Crowdsourced guronse-soup tips from Gambian twitter:

9375 2018-08-28 01:54:09 Otherwise he said it’s hundreds of versions of “family house recipe”, sort of like spaghetti sauce. I use EVOO, garlic,  zest, (sometimes tahini, but it’s such a pain...you won’t miss it with really good oil) pepper, parsley and salt.
9376 2018-08-28 01:53:50 So I used the Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser for the first time. Its sort of like the oil cleanser in a double cleanse routine. That said my face is SO SOFT. it feels really nice. So far i really like it.
9377 2018-08-28 01:53:48 I’ve been using some coconut oil, it’s not working the past couple of days have been the worse 
9378 2018-08-28 01:53:44 Burnt honey, almond milk and tea tree oil with a facial moisturizer. It’s done wonders and smells so good.
9379 2018-08-28 01:53:36 150, which wasn’t bad.  Oil change, rotation, and a couple bulb replacements. They had another 600 in “suggested” actions, but I elected not to do that.
9380 2018-08-28 01:53:32 I love all the things Bergamot!
Lavender oil and bergamot oil HEAVENLY
Bergamot and orange, lime, lemon, ginger, lemongrass, mint! All Bergamot over here 
9381 2018-08-28 01:53:23 I've just learned most British chocolate has all of the cocoa butter replaced with vegetable oil and they had a decade-long fight with the EU over this being allowed to be presented as chocolate
9382 2018-08-28 01:53:22 Crude oil பேரல் $140 இருந்தப்ப பெட்ரோல் ரூ 70/லிட் வித்தாங்க, பேரல் $ 40 இருக்கறப்ப ரூ 80/லிட் விக்கறீங்க. திரு. மோடி வாத்தியாரா இருக்கற ஸ்கூல்ல ஹெட்மாஸ்டரா இருந்தவர் திரு. மன்மோகன் சிங்.

9387 2018-08-28 01:52:10 Danielle, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. How can eco-zealots obstruct Gay friendly oil when the alternative is #bloodoil from dictator regimes?  @CalgaryPride
9388 2018-08-28 01:52:06 Sure it’ll solve the issue on every single flight with people trying to stuff oil barrel sized luggage into the overhead bins. They’d make more money if they sold the bin space.
9389 2018-08-28 01:52:06 Boiling in oil.
9390 2018-08-28 01:51:52 I was hollering lmao! I don’t want black soap in my eyes if it’s worse than tea tree oil, eyes was blurry 
9391 2018-08-28 01:51:43 Tengo ganas de tener un chongo pero no encuentro uno
9392 2018-08-28 01:51:32 Oh. That makes sense. I was literally picturing someone pouring the herbicide in instead of oil 
9393 2018-08-28 01:51:30 Jamaican Black Castor Oil for moisture. You could do raw shea butter as well.

I wash and condition with Shea Moisture products.
9394 2018-08-28 01:51:27 What really works well as a deterrent is to rub yourself in fish oil from head to toe. Try it.
9395 2018-08-28 01:51:25 Oil companies get enough subsidies.
9396 2018-08-28 01:51:10 Nice very nice, I’ve got whipped cream and baby oil

9398 2018-08-28 01:51:09 Got stood up on a date. *acts shocked*

Made the best of it - hot oil hair mask, face mask, eye masks, feet masks, & lip mask. Followed by a bubble bath.

I’m also high as shit and watching my favorite show. Life is good. Self care is important. 

& <most> men suck.
9399 2018-08-28 01:51:06 "regular" mayonnaise is trash that tastes like oil.
9400 2018-08-28 01:51:02 I laced those peanuts with a lather of pure authentic oil from chicken meat! You are now officially not a vegan! Mwaaahahahahha
9401 2018-08-28 01:50:52 Gas is down to $2.59 a gal today in Tampa. Which is the oil and gas terminals for the West coast of Florida. Seems like every couple of weeks it goes up .20 cents a gal and starts to go back down. Go figure.
9402 2018-08-28 01:50:19 Just finished reading Susan Allport's The Queen of Fats and have a better-than-average understanding of omega 3, omega 6, EPA, DHA, ALA, LA, and some of the rest, but I'm still not getting what's wrong with canola oil.
9403 2018-08-28 01:50:17 シャワールームに入るときに必ず「紙パンツは履いた方がいい？」と聞くようにしてる。「履かなくていいですよー」と言われた後にゴミ箱に前の客の紙パンツが捨ててあるのを見ると、なんか勝った気がする

9411 2018-08-28 01:48:39 Yes there is! Tea tree oil (the real kind) being in your eye 
9412 2018-08-28 01:48:38 Aha! I tricked you! *raises a bottle of Chicken Oil from his pocket*
9413 2018-08-28 01:48:06 My 3 licensed government growers + MMJ are all out of CBD oil tinctures. I had to go to Georgia Peach and buy it off some dude (cash only) that probably had a gun LOL
9414 2018-08-28 01:48:01 I use Alkalol nasal rinse, oil of oregano, vitamin D, vitamin C, a bottle of Immunoberry, airborne, and just pump all that shit! There's also a pack called Viracid that fights colds I take anytime I feel one coming on!
9415 2018-08-28 01:48:01 Holly, What is your choice?  Do you prefer buying Canada’s Gay friendly, feminist friendly oil or do you prefer to buy #bloodoil ? Pls tell #LGBTQ why you prefer #bloodoil and why you don’t care about killing ? @vancouverpride @FierteCapPride
9416 2018-08-28 01:47:44 That’s why you’re the man!

9422 2018-08-28 01:47:05 this crew in oakland called club chai had southeast asian food at a warehouse party, the dance floor smelled like coconut oil it was heavenly
9423 2018-08-28 01:47:02 @SecretaryZinke We don’t appreciate that u r busy unprotecting our lovely public lands. No oil, mining etc leases.
9424 2018-08-28 01:46:50 I believe he would enjoy the ball-gag (I know him to be fond of Tarantino's gimps) so I would say a wood plane and some furniture oil to do more  polishing. Non-specific but narcissistic.
9425 2018-08-28 01:46:36 Checking level re oil ne dip stick
9426 2018-08-28 01:46:33 Victim? I thought I was living life large when mom would make grilled cheese samiches or Mac n cheese from those huge blocks of WIC cheese. Half a barrel of oil goes in each one, but man that’s good eatin.

9435 2018-08-28 01:45:11 Chin: 

-changes in hormones usually before your period 

-try not to rest your chin in your hands, the hands will transfer dirt and oil onto the chin 

-lip balm can even cause breakouts around the mouth area so also check 12 hours before using it properly
9436 2018-08-28 01:45:11 I keep getting bubbles in the syringe when I draw oil and I'm scared
9437 2018-08-28 01:44:53 we wont get volunteer harvesters onto electric busses to the farms until there is less oil for them to burn. put one oil company out of business per year. that would instill existential fear in the remaining companies to get serious about "alternatives".
9438 2018-08-28 01:44:52 Now...can I interest you both in a olive (or coconut) oil massage?
9439 2018-08-28 01:44:44 I remember when we didn’t have money and I wanted Chinese food so bae literally went out of her way to make it from scratch homeade like I’m talking sesame oil and all
9440 2018-08-28 01:44:08 We have started Sable on CBD oil and an essential oil to help her with her anxieties, it makes her very cuddly and it’s the best.
9441 2018-08-28 01:44:06 @kuddlow If u want to tariff Canada on Auto then we will am sure raise our price to you on energy which was the worst deal anyone could have done period. Oil will now be sold to u at price a lot higher than it is now. U r trying to be a bully and all u r is a wimp.
9442 2018-08-28 01:43:53 Peppermint oil 
9443 2018-08-28 01:43:48 tacos made with two soft corn tortillas. outside one seared crispy but not hard for a smoky start, inside one fried in a lil lard or oil til warm for a silky finish DON'T @ ME
9444 2018-08-28 01:43:47 Nobody ever calculates the real cost of oil. Add in the fortune in blood and treasure it takes to secure the stuff for the whole world. Then tell me that oil isn’t hugely subsidized.
9445 2018-08-28 01:43:44 castor oil! thank me later! massage it into your scalp every night
9446 2018-08-28 01:43:35 And by discover it I mean they charge more for it and cover it in truffle oil
9447 2018-08-28 01:43:32 I love the smell of tea tree oil, even if it does remind me of being 7 and having head lice
9448 2018-08-28 01:43:29 I feel like such a dad for how heckin pumped I got that the replacement oil cap for my car came in the mail today. Giving me butterflies.

9458 2018-08-28 01:42:33 Why is it that so many "pumpkin" things are just "I heard you like clove oil..."
9459 2018-08-28 01:42:22 Lunch for an oil change? fucking done

9463 2018-08-28 01:41:33 Numbers. We out produced the Germans and overwhelmed them, though they had a superior machine. Also, we had air superiority. Tiger tanks were not impervious to 500 pounders. Also, we cut them off from petroleum, because WWII was a war for oil.
9464 2018-08-28 01:41:16 If that doesn't violate @twitter rules, then saying that @jack should be boiled in crude oil,  while his friends are forced to watch, is not against the rules either.....Right?

Yeah sure! I will be so banned for violation of Liberalville policy!
9465 2018-08-28 01:41:01 Don't blame National, blame the voters who voted for Snake Oil Salesman Winston Peters.
9466 2018-08-28 01:40:53 I use wild growth oil, it’s given me volume and more length
9467 2018-08-28 01:40:42 But the zio&occult media ( engineered the post 911 wars at a worse far worse than good ol Hitler whose UFO’s have a huge Mid East presence and always show up for wars especially with youthful population)linked with Saudi alliance does not want our oil flooding the global markets
9468 2018-08-28 01:40:35 Thoroughly enjoyed the Cuba Libre documentary on Netflix. Now, I am searching for something like that, but on Venezuela. Fun Fact: Venezuela *gave* Cuba 100,000 barrels of oil per day. Cuba sold half for $ to buy food and used the other half. What did Cuba give in exchange?

9472 2018-08-28 01:40:13 Forehead: 
-try not to use too many oil products or pomades on your hair; the oil from the hair can transfer onto your forehead
 
-cut your bangs or use hair ties to move hair away from the face  

-dandruff can also trigger forehead acne so invest in a good shampoo.

9477 2018-08-28 01:39:47 Kickbacks would be my guess.
Why say No to Canadian Oil? Royalties?
They don't say No to Transfer Payments 
Follow the money 

Even a twit can see the colossal Footprint of tankering unregulated oil.

It's Not about ethics either
or we would not be financing/arming these regimes
9478 2018-08-28 01:39:41 My window fan died... I'll open it up and clean it tomorrow... Try some oil... Didn't even last one summer...  Cheap crap...

9483 2018-08-28 01:38:28 i wonder if jaemin is scared of splashing oil when he's cooking
9484 2018-08-28 01:38:02 Usually turn the tv off in the living room when I go to bed around 7:45. My son and Tanya are busy tucking the grandkids and I know for a fact they don’t burn the midnight oil until 8:45. Tonight though, I left it on! Jurassic Park was finally on (5th time in 9 days). 
9485 2018-08-28 01:38:01 If you're insinuating that Canada would refuse oil to the US in a time of war, then they aren't an ally. Stick them in with the same list as Saudi and Venezuela.
9486 2018-08-28 01:37:54 1 bunch beets (5-6 medium); juice/zest of 1 lemon; 3/4 c nonfat Fage; 2 garlic cloves crushed; 2 T olive oil; 1 T tahini (optional); 1/2 t cumin; 1/2 t grated ginger (optional); S&P to taste.

9487 2018-08-28 01:37:54 @KaeElmer hi Kae. I received the pulverized c60 today. I have been trying get info from redlion on how to combine with the 2 liter bottle of olive oil I got from Costco. They pointed me to their website but I'm very confused. I watched your video but I dont have any equipment.

9492 2018-08-28 01:36:56 D best solution is 2 make electric cars truly affordable but still have gr8t quality. D 2018 Tata Nano all electric has this advantage-most likely not going 2 cost more than $5k & will decrease plastic significantly (plastic is a by product of oil)
@elonmusk @Apple @tim_cook
9493 2018-08-28 01:36:54 Yummy dinner - zucchini & yellow squash stir-fried in olive oil with black pepper & @SanJTamari , low-sodium. Juicy chicken, which is chicken cutlets baked with good mayonnaise and parmesan on top. Popcorn for appetizer, carb, and dessert, because that is how I roll.
9494 2018-08-28 01:36:39 I'd go with cold pressed sunflower oil, unheated or used in low heat only for short time to cook. Canola has been found to create problems in the body.

9495 2018-08-28 01:36:39 Oh. So, that whole 5yr ban on lobbying doesn’t extend to lobbying for oil, I guess.
9496 2018-08-28 01:36:36 COCONUT AND OLIVE OIL AS SUNSCREEN are you trying to cook yourself like a rotisserie chicken
9497 2018-08-28 01:36:34 sweet almond oil is giving my skin life.

9503 2018-08-28 01:35:43 Inhofe is a disgrace, bought and paid for by big oil.
9504 2018-08-28 01:35:41 On this day in history in 1859 the first commercially successful U.S. oil well near Titusville, PA was built. 

1908 Lyndon Johnson was born in Stonewall, TX.

1928 The Kellogg-Briand Pact, outlawing war, was signed.

9505 2018-08-28 01:35:18 Was expecting The Village's grown-in-Sacramento Mimosa designer cannabis strain and The Village's/Moxie's Mimosa live resin vape oil collaboration to taste like Coke vs. Diet Coke -- but it's more like Coke vs. New Coke, with cheesy funk in both the flower and the cartridge.
9506 2018-08-28 01:35:16 The largest Oil Company was brought to ashes because Ramirez started the era of diverting funds from the oil company to his own personal bank account and others that He protected and benefit. Among them, the daughter of the Dictador Hugo Chavez....

9508 2018-08-28 01:35:14 Pull your drain plug, let the oil drain, tighten the drain plug. Change your oil filter and replace it. Flat tire? Grab your lug wrench take all 4,5,6 or 8 lugs off, however many you have, replace with your spare, tighten the lugs. Need a jump? Red on red, black on black. 
9509 2018-08-28 01:35:07 lol, thought about that too... because my mum (non-diabetic & very skinny & fit- 5'11; ~135lbs)  (still) takes cod liver oil...  what to do?...

9520 2018-08-28 01:33:54 Love the burgers, especially the McDoubles. However, my local McDs has a habit of serving previously fried fries that have been dipped in hot oil and called fresh. They also have a habit of not accepting cards for payments at times, being 'cash only' during those times.

9529 2018-08-28 01:31:46 Hoping CBD oil works.
9530 2018-08-28 01:31:41 Because we're spinning into hell, all is naught, the sigils burn in their oil and the fumes sicken the faithful. The old covenants unwind. The sun darkens. The stars go out one by one and all is silent in the rooms of ruin.
9531 2018-08-28 01:31:24 Please make sure you track the record of Ramirez the President of the Oil Company for more than 7 years. Under his leadership the company started to decline due to his lack of understanding of the industry and most importantly the corruption that brought it  to bancrupcy.

9538 2018-08-28 01:30:27 Thanks, PM Trudeau. Hoping Canada will consider building up Electric Vehicle industry to offset future decline in oil/gas industry. Canada/California more similar in environment. Maybe car industry trade agreements could have EV provisions. Think of pipeline protests. #PeopleTax

9543 2018-08-28 01:29:58 Yeah, they are translated so many different way. None of them are perfect. Probably tree mushroom is the least terrible. They taste great, though, especially with some garlic, sesame oil, and a little cilantro, imo.
9544 2018-08-28 01:29:54 But getting our oil to the east would have increased that, and if they refitted the refineries we could become oil independent . None of the countries we buy from have anything near the environmental standards that we do for oil production. Our gov’t is hypocritical.

9550 2018-08-28 01:29:26 The fashion industry is the second largest polluter in the world behind the oil & gas industry. That’s so sad, but I’m glad I chose this industry with my feelings about the environment. Maybe I’ll be the change the fashion industry needs!

9552 2018-08-28 01:28:56 It's made worse by selective preferential funding. My friend could not continue his research into small scale mining by impoverished people in developing countries. There are scores of research projects into coal seam gasification, clean coal, & enhanced oil recovery.
9553 2018-08-28 01:28:39 2/2 DOH uses DUBIOUSLY FLAWED master-lists to mislead media, government agencies and the general public. The Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) and the relatives of the Dengvaxia victims have solid pieces of evidence to prove Dengvaxia was administered.
9554 2018-08-28 01:28:37 I use it to help my 11 year old dog, he has arthritis and inflammation, it helps him quite a bit. This is a stunning example of misplaced morality in Ohio and quite possibly a cash grab by our elected officials. There is no reason for CBD oil to be regulated...
9555 2018-08-28 01:28:19 1/2 DOH, even after more than 29 months of the indiscriminate, mass Dengvaxia vaccinations on March 31, 2016 (Garin) until November 29, 2017 (Duque), has NO verifiable, complete and correct Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) master-lists consolidated per region.

9573 2018-08-28 01:25:04 The oil wars of 1872 turned Cleveland society upside down. Many who had made easy fortunes in oil refining and built splendid mansions on Euclid Avenue found themselves bankrupt and forced to sell.

9581 2018-08-28 01:23:49 That's what I'm confused about, under Trump some of the lowest unemployment in history, millions of jobs created, record stock and dow, factories operating, trade deals all over the world, set to be one of the largest oil producers.
Exactly what economic benefit has our PM done
9582 2018-08-28 01:23:47 見下ろしながら会話するの楽しいね！！！！！！
9583 2018-08-28 01:23:45 WHAT THE PHUCK  - starting to think the coconut oil has expired #Bebold??
9584 2018-08-28 01:23:36 Yes; a thin layer of butter or oil in a cast iron pan on medium heat- if you're careful it turns out the nicest shade of golden brown (or, if you're me, 9/10 times it winds up almost burnt, but this is the fault of the operator not the method itself)
9585 2018-08-28 01:23:34 Ahh yes, the familiar sting of pure tea tree oil
9586 2018-08-28 01:23:30 I have heard from women that rubbing your hands with coconut oil helps
9587 2018-08-28 01:23:19 My man changed my oil and then slow danced with me in his kitchen while I cooked dinner. Where has this life been?! 
9588 2018-08-28 01:23:14 Lmao at “fragrances and oil & stuff” I imagined you wearing a dashiki with some classic jazz and Gucci loafers

9599 2018-08-28 01:21:42 I’m so mad I put all this oil in in my hair, I didn’t realize it was running down the side of my head.

9603 2018-08-28 01:20:12 Our attendance numbers show a huge drop once school and football start. We have motorcycles next weekend and the Lucas Oil Late Model Nationals the following week. So that’s really only one off week before our finale and LM Nats. Ending in mid September is good.

9608 2018-08-28 01:19:14 JLo is known to slim down with the grapefruit oil diet. Studies show smelling it can reduce one's appetite and help with portion control.

9615 2018-08-28 01:17:46 I am Single Mother Call Me Sexy Milf . in this video, i am rubbing almond oil all over my breast and belly while playing with my yummy nipples. FANTASIES MAY come to reality, Finger twirling around in circles just watching this video of myself makes my pussy so wet 
9616 2018-08-28 01:17:40 Roasting broccoli and cauliflower on a pan in the oven with a little olive oil and salt  is my favorite though
9617 2018-08-28 01:17:33 Lamb and fresh figs drizzled in olive oil. Lamb can be a bit costly but I mostly cook for one.
9618 2018-08-28 01:17:29 The short distance of Alberta Oil to BC's tide water is short. Provincial transfer payments need to reflect how we all use that money. It SHOULD go to help Canadians to go to a green economy. But only we can make our politicians make that happen
9619 2018-08-28 01:17:22 @Elijahlujano changed my oil and cleaned my car yesterday  what a sweetheart

9622 2018-08-28 01:16:39 @FLGovScott it has been 3 months that I have lost 90% of all of my revenue due to the red tide. You need to do whatever it takes to figure this out. This is 1000% worse than the BP oil spill and they at least made up the loss to the businesses.
9623 2018-08-28 01:16:37 Be well. CBD oil helps a good friend of mine.

9626 2018-08-28 01:16:29 I care more about transporting oil inside pipes. I hope Trump ticks you all off every day.
9627 2018-08-28 01:16:25 Nope - want that beautiful oil
9628 2018-08-28 01:16:24 I think I put too many peppermint essential oil drops in my bath

9630 2018-08-28 01:16:12 Took my car to get an oil change and they did not roll my window up when it started raining. Now I have a soaked car seat. And I didnt even get a discount on my oil change.

9634 2018-08-28 01:15:29 My cholesterol levels are lower than my MD's using Coconut Oil, I also use Olive Oil, I never use Vegetable Oil or Canola. I use real Butter too. The trick is MODERATION not saturation.
9635 2018-08-28 01:15:15 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
9636 2018-08-28 01:15:13 When I woke up, I downed a coke, took some Tylenol, and lathered on my peppermint oil and it seem to be gone within like an hour or so

9638 2018-08-28 01:14:07 Ugh I’m sorry that’s happening to you. Maybe tweeze your brows until your skin feels better? Start using a very light exfoliant, vitamin E oil is good and sunscreen until that area is healed 
9639 2018-08-28 01:13:53 Depending on the leadership mechanism installed, sanctions could be lifted quickly. Honestly, the best deal they could cut for themselves is letting the Russians fund the oil, take a %, in exchange for a suspension of debt payment. PDVSA bonds have ~0 value until then.
9640 2018-08-28 01:13:51 But no because an air fryer is healthy and it’s still crunchy! You don’t need excess oil );

9642 2018-08-28 01:13:44 I just shaved using coconut oil & maaaaaan, I’m smooth as a baby butt.
9643 2018-08-28 01:13:44 For a minute there I thought you were joking. They knew about man made climate change in the early 1900's. Oil companies tried to hide that they knew fossil fuels were driving it in the 70's.
9644 2018-08-28 01:13:42 I've just accidentally rubbed olbas oil into my eyes so they are burning slightly but feel very fresh.
9645 2018-08-28 01:13:42 Can't screen shot my bank home page. If I feel like it when I'm home I'll take a screen shot of it. However I like to relax when I'm home. I may or may not do it. Depends on if I feel you're important enough. Busy out here in the oil fields making money.
9646 2018-08-28 01:13:42 Don't expect oil from those you malign.

9652 2018-08-28 01:12:19 I really like hot chili oil. (I make my own rather than buy it). It's not used in the same way as hot sauce, but it adds a really nice spice to foods you might not want to put hot sauce on.
9653 2018-08-28 01:11:57 There are a lot out there to choose from now. I specialize in providing people a name brand, high grade product at a closer to wholesale price. I wanted to try it for my anxiety but didn't want to spend $100 so I decided to buy bulk and sell it! I have Nuleaf Naturals CBD Oil
9654 2018-08-28 01:11:40 Is Fessy rubbing olive oil on himself right now? Serious question. Looks just like a bottle of EVOO. @ArmstrongTaran @itsmelissaaa @OneLuckyGay
9655 2018-08-28 01:11:34 Yup, I still have my leaves since I don't really use them. Lagipon yesterday I used the OIL I worked during national day. So save sikit. Is it? It's really contagious seh. Macam tak baik2. Penat 
9656 2018-08-28 01:11:33 School personnel not only often feed, clothe, buy school supplies, home heating oil, and beds for their students and their families, but also lay down their lives for them against school shooters. I say we serve our country and do so proudly.
9657 2018-08-28 01:11:32 Yes, warning it’s not fun. 

Original Keto Diet.  It’s pretty much meat and greens.  A ridiculous amount of water.  And supplements, fish oil, and multi.  I wear glasses and the blue tint for screens help so much.  
And of course exercise.
9658 2018-08-28 01:11:27 A stimulated economy from resource sales, attracting investors and decreasing oil imports to independence would allow our country to afford the expensive tradition to green energy.  JT has screwed our economy and wants to put a tax in place that will do nothing.
9659 2018-08-28 01:11:26 Thanks to @lance_sands for coming and putting oil in my car while I was in class  I thought it was going to explode 
9660 2018-08-28 01:11:07 It's also another reminderp i guess when reading now about car stuff that I really need to get my oil changed and emissions test done like this week.  And def. new tyres before winter.
9661 2018-08-28 01:10:51 It's hollow so maybe the top/spout from some kind of ceramic water/oil jug?
9662 2018-08-28 01:10:48 Color ME SHOCKED. A oil shill goes work for oil shills.
9663 2018-08-28 01:10:35 Did you use oil on top of acrylic or acrylic on top of oil? Cause it it was acrylic on top of oil it’s a miracle the paint didn’t just peel off, but the other way around works fine. But nothing pisses me off more than people pretending to be experts when they’re clearly amateurs
9664 2018-08-28 01:10:20 OIL BRENT US$76.25/bbl +0.79%. South Sudan's Unity Fields restarts production after 5-year halt; initially expected to produce 45kbpd.

9669 2018-08-28 01:09:58 Get that pipeline built and stop having to sell our oil to Americans at a discount. We have no one else who can buy it. We need leverage somewhere beyond SM. We need to be less dependant and be a proactive world trader.

9674 2018-08-28 01:08:57 1) Will China still have no problem generating USD’s via exports if they are running a current acct deficit overall (due to tourism/services)?

2) CNY oil contract allows them to ctrl phys oil flows &/or int’l trade value of USD - valuable when USD increasingly being weaponized
9675 2018-08-28 01:08:53 That's what I do with mine. I add a drop of tarte or farsali oil and it makes it super creamy
9676 2018-08-28 01:08:46 There’s treats with the stuff in it or just oil itself. I’ve only used the oil and put it on Mariah’s dry treats. If I remember right Magoo will let his M put the dropper in his mouth and just feeds it to him directly. I’ll get you a link to the 2 places I’ve ordered from shortly
9677 2018-08-28 01:08:41 Idk why we're out here calling lavender essence and tea tree juice "essential oils" when the most essential oil is obviously crude
9678 2018-08-28 01:08:41 Siraj, scientists are saying, any amount of alcohol harms our bodies/health,

so can your GoFundMe account buy raw, unsalted Brazil nuts/walnuts/sunflower seeds; fresh cranberries/veggies;& garlic oil; + 2 T olive oil/day for prostate health

& cannabis instead? 
9679 2018-08-28 01:08:38 $825 as a long term gold price implies a long term oil price of $50, maybe a little less. Agree?

9690 2018-08-28 01:07:17 A trustworthy gov goes a long way. Ease the currency controls and negotiate a positive deal on the debts held by foreign nations (Rus/China). Accept every bit of humanitarian aid available and seek a second nation to fund the cultivation of the oil they've located.
9691 2018-08-28 01:07:11 I went to work. Came home and did a little work out cause your girl getting super fat. Took a shower and left for class. After class, I stopped by Walmart cause I was craving mi sopita y chuletas on the side  so I drove my happy fatass home and came to realize there’s no oil 
9692 2018-08-28 01:06:53 I went to Walmart to get oil for my car and called my dad to make sure I was getting the right one and he told me the one I got was for lawn mowers. You tried Lex :)
9693 2018-08-28 01:06:52 But can he change his own oil?
9694 2018-08-28 01:06:50 JT has no respect for the west. Won’t do squat for us. He’s too stupid to realize the benefits of getting oil to the east coast for market and to refine for domestic use. There would be more money for green transition and no more dependency on imported oil.
9695 2018-08-28 01:06:41 Want silk-like skin, fast? After a shower, while your skin's still damp, apply olive oil all over your body and pat dry with a damp towel.
9696 2018-08-28 01:06:20 Agree with this big picture—think the US is best off with oil $65-80/bbl. All the upstream benefits, not much consumption headwind.

Think NG net exports to Canada are a long ways (8+ yrs) off though. Lots of the Montney works at low gas prices; WCSB production is rising again.

9700 2018-08-28 01:05:44 This one has baking soda, coconut oil, and peppermint oil. But I use different stuff, whatever I have on hand to make them.
9701 2018-08-28 01:05:41 This was a serious explanation of why a spoonful of oil before drinking alcohol keeps you from getting drunk:
  Oil floats on other liquids and when the booze enters your stomach, the oil will form a film over it and avoid the alcohol fumes from rising and reaching your brain.
9702 2018-08-28 01:05:34 They can be entered, but it doesn't specifically track their statistics.

Its been a massive point of contention in MN and the Dakota's.  

Especially oil country

Afghanistan
Iraq

Do hundreds of thousands of brown people matter less?

9710 2018-08-28 01:04:45 Animal lovers in general should not support Trump. He is deregulating our Nation parks and try in big to open them for oil drilling.

9712 2018-08-28 01:04:37 The scary part of losing NAFTA is that #Turdeau is free to restrict oil production in Canada now. Another NEP will be in the works if he gets in for another term.

9715 2018-08-28 01:04:02 Like & Retweet if you support @realDonaldTrump shutting down the central banks, so we can go back to printing our own money,  backed by gold instead of oil, as well as giving all Americans full access to the blockchain crypto currency market #MAGA #USA #TRUMP 
9716 2018-08-28 01:04:01 2/Simply naive to think big Corps will allow their wholly-controlled subsidiary to cover stories uncomfortable to Corp Power. No coverage of #DAPL where unarmed, totally peaceful protestors were attacked by Police protecting oil interests that were breaking the law...
9717 2018-08-28 01:03:55 Billionaires should NOT be on welfare. You’re right. So why do we hand out billions and billions of dollars in subsidies to farm corporations and oil and gas companies??
9718 2018-08-28 01:03:12 Put about half a bottom of lavender essential oil in this bathtub because I suck at gauging essential oil use... ready, set, and smell like lavender for a month. #lavender #destress #fails

9721 2018-08-28 01:02:41 I am a gun owner and supporter of sensible gun laws.  What I am against is corporations and lobbyists owning politicians and the NRA is at the forefront, along with Pharma, Oil, etc.  Pass some legislation that will eliminate the auctioning off of political influence.

9733 2018-08-28 00:59:59 Extra virgin oil is 100% olive oil and I think the others have other stuff mixed with it
9734 2018-08-28 00:59:57 No, I think that she tends to be hypersensitive and blows her lid often. She's a fire cracker and highly opinionated and can be oil on a fire. But I am a woman of science/law, and I deal in facts. Again, I can draw my own suppositions, but I wait for judgment by court.
9735 2018-08-28 00:59:51 Hey now, Musk will call their boss who is probably heavily invested in oil.

9740 2018-08-28 00:59:15 Pretty sure we aren't the only country besides Iran that use the Straights to transport oil and other goods. Saudi Arabia also used those waters, as does Jordan. This may be a fight we don't need to engage in, just offer material support and let nature take its course.
9741 2018-08-28 00:59:12 I need an oil change so lazy
9742 2018-08-28 00:59:01 White egyptian musk + my sacred rose oil
9743 2018-08-28 00:58:52 Tigers and Panthers are shit but it never mattered what weapons Nazi Germany came out with, they had no oil. My favourite is the amount of time and steel they wasted for the Porsche prototype of the Tiger even though they knew they were never going to use it!
9744 2018-08-28 00:58:48  I'm certain some people do it by design. No other explanation. Btw, a hacksaw cuts through chain quite well. Use a dab of cooking oil on the blade while sawing.
9745 2018-08-28 00:58:26 So uh.. deep drilling in the OCEAN doesn’t disrupt ocean life? Give me proof of turbines creating waste. I can give you an abudent example on what drilling can cause. Oil spills. Billions of dollars wasted.
9746 2018-08-28 00:58:24 and china has no problem generating $ via exports to pay for its oil ...

9749 2018-08-28 00:57:38 never have been convinced that the CNY contract is a game changer.   want to buy oil in CNY?  combine an oil forward in dollars with a CNY forward.   As long as you deliver CNY, you get dollars, and then get oil ... works out the same.  or would if CNY was freely tradable.
9750 2018-08-28 00:57:35 Unfortunately, the biggest change is the NAME of the agreement as #ConManDon continues to peddle snake oil
9751 2018-08-28 00:57:34 Label says product is FREE of gluten, soy, & nuts, along with dairy/lactose & preservatives. Makes it seem as if health-conscious people stay away from those things. Aside from people who cannot tolerate gluten, soy, or nuts, those foods are, in my view, better than coconut oil.

9760 2018-08-28 00:56:14 Dean clearly used the baby oil #RAW
9761 2018-08-28 00:56:02 So you don't believe that the US invaded Iraq in 2003, and supported an Anglo-French-Qatari overthrow of Qaddafi in 2011, in response to threats to trade oil in non-US currency?
9762 2018-08-28 00:55:47 Squeaky wheel always gets the oil, right?
9763 2018-08-28 00:55:27 Where should I go to get some cbd oil? What are the prices like at the dispensary?
9764 2018-08-28 00:55:12 Robert Millikan successfully measured oil droplets, which proved electrons were negatively charged. This contributed greatly to our understanding of the structure of the atom. :1908
9765 2018-08-28 00:55:06 I’d rather had a pot head breast feed as aopposed to say, a moth head. But yeah. It’s not a great idea because we don’t know the consequences of thc on developing brains. 
That being said, however, Cannabis oil is proven to help kids with seizures.
9766 2018-08-28 00:54:40 This is why the CNY oil contract is so important; will give China an a 2nd lever to manage CNY.  Also, a nation that can print domestic currency for commodity imports can’t have a BoP crisis (see US.)
9767 2018-08-28 00:54:38 One time my cousin thought an oil lamp at an antique store was a bong and I’ve never forgotten that moment
9768 2018-08-28 00:54:28 What’s up with extra virgin olive oil. I feel like it’s everywhere...even in my own house

9775 2018-08-28 00:53:27 Only a quarter of their loss on oil and gas  in the US though. 
9776 2018-08-28 00:53:06 The GEJ govt used the oil money to pay oil subsidies and to subsidize the naira. The will of the people prevailed when they embarked on #OccupyNigera. You can't eat you cake and have it.
PMB has superfluously inflated PMS used per day from 35m to 60m litres per day within a year.

9813 2018-08-28 00:47:22 Obama was a snake oil salesman. Nothing but a smooth talker. A true BS artist. I can't wait till they uncover the rest of his involvement in this election mess. He is waste deep in it and the worst president in history! I don't care how many garbage graphs you have
9814 2018-08-28 00:47:07 We might be oil and water, this could be a big mistake, we might burn like gasoline and fire, It's a chance we'll have to take
9815 2018-08-28 00:46:52 Other issues? @JimFrancisLA01 says millennials are going to be voting this year, and they are not optimistic about their future. Real immigration reform, a real tax cut for the middle class, and increase the minimum wage. Also oil & gas should fix the damage they do.
9816 2018-08-28 00:46:50 I was looking for a new suppler for down hole plugs. I heard about this place called "The Plug Guys" in TX, so I googled it. The results were very disturbing.

9920 2018-08-28 00:31:43 Go oil up, sleaze.
9921 2018-08-28 00:31:43 This is not "socialism" as practiced in Europe or even in Cuba. Venezuela is a corrupt state dependent on exporting oil. To say it collapsed because of "socialism" is disingenuous.
9922 2018-08-28 00:31:32 I thought the U.S. Navy secured a route through the Strait of Hormuz. Have they been withdrawn? Or is this some kind of deal Trump has made with Saudi Arabia or Putin? Definitely will cause oil/gas prices to go up.

9935 2018-08-28 00:29:38 Does that include severance taxes on oil/gas/coal etc? That would distort a description of the tax burden, no? There's a reason we don't think of WY and ND as high tax states.
9936 2018-08-28 00:29:37 Key question is why 180? KSA knows more than any of us and suspect its explosive for oil which is only reasonable conclusion
9937 2018-08-28 00:28:51 I am hopeful. Call me crazy. If this doesn’t go as planned and MrTrump is forced out, the gig is up and America will become third world.God help us. @realDonaldTrump

9950 2018-08-28 00:27:02 Impressive news coming out of Kebbi State. Hope others will begin to buckle up and no wait for Daddy (FG) to dole out pocket money (Proceeds from crude oil sales). 

The growth in oil is directly related to increase in crude oil price though + a slight increase in oil production.

10001 2018-08-28 00:19:25 Considering the fact that it is a snake oil salesman's dream, in that it truly 'cures all that ails you', I can live with the disappointment of one aspect of it being ineffective.
10002 2018-08-28 00:19:22 There’s an oil for that
10003 2018-08-28 00:19:10 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?

10005 2018-08-28 00:18:59 As a Reds fan, we should have aborted our season back in April. I do enjoy olive oil though. I bought a jalapeño olive oil in Wilmington, NC and I dip bread into it like there is no tomorrow.

10014 2018-08-28 00:17:11 What should he do? Ban pistols? Do we even know how he bought it yet? Keep in mind the NRA is not a business it is funded out of pocket by blue collar American citizens it’s different than being paid off by Wall Street, Oil companies or big pharmaceutical.

Cause if it was hemp milk I know that's a p popular non-dairy milk cause there's no nut allergens but if it's the oil they might be trying to market it to stoners even tho iirc hemp oil really doesn't do anything
