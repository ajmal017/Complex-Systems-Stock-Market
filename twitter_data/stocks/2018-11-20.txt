9 2018-11-20 23:55:39 Actually, even the economy is not that good. Huge national debt and over-valued stocks. Cost of food and gas continuing to increase.  But yeah, Trump's tough talk is even more empty now, knowing that he squandered an incredible opportunity.

49 2018-11-20 23:45:26 Everyone screams : „sell , it’s over“, means buy , because they are standing beside the line. After euphoric party  stocks may fall „ privates are cooler then  the profis“ — 
that’s the  bell — SELL ! Comes in 2 years , don’t panic
50 2018-11-20 23:45:19 $TEZOS at 65c now. Literally sold a small amt that I bot at $1.80...for a massive loss...at $1.10.....2 or 3 days ago....that's one example of how "it's over for a while" (as I say alot) These alts are STOCKS...and OBVIOUSLY the mkt thinks so too.....stocks that are low-go lower.
51 2018-11-20 23:42:04 The only issue I have with that thesis is you don’t need a “recession” to say sell or don’t buy stocks. Telling someone who purchases $CAT 50 points higher at $173, don’t worry we’re not having a recession doesn’t make them feel better.
52 2018-11-20 23:41:39 Is There a FAANG Bubble?
The valuation and spectacular performance of the FAANGs have been likened to that of the tech stocks before the 2000 dotcom burst, which saw a lot of overvalued tech companies crash, sending the global markets to a downward spiral.
53 2018-11-20 23:41:10 I watched the entire thing, live, while it was airing. He slumped in his chair. He wouldn't make eye contact. He admitted that maybe making a bet on bitcoin, instead of stocks, was the wrong move, and then he said it would take institutions to take cryptos to the next level.

58 2018-11-20 23:38:13 It’s dropping horribly now. All gains from 2018, are GONE!!! 

Remember how he kept bragging about his stocks going up!!!  
He said “better than Obama’s” which wasn’t true, but what will he say now?? 

Doesn’t matter to the traitor tots, they will defend trump no matter what!!
59 2018-11-20 23:36:52 What great things? This country is so full of hate, people are afraid to go to the supermarket. Stocks lost all gains for the year. Prices are higher. What has changed so great in your life. Not what your told is great. What has been great for you?
60 2018-11-20 23:36:40 75% correction is not something rare in a crash. 
Already happened in the past for companies with great fundamentals. 
Could take months but there is no way i would buy stocks right now.
61 2018-11-20 23:36:37 Again when the recession hits, the price of gold WILL go up. So while stocks and other investments are tumbling, any money you have in gold WILL be “saved”. And you’re on here pumping crypto so I assume you’re invested in it and so benefit from others buying in as well.
62 2018-11-20 23:36:28 For me, 2018 has been my financially BEST year that I ever had...  Stocks, bonds, and other investments while I'm doing well on salary with bonuses.  And I haven't been that aggressive with my money and had to use some for enhancing my house.
63 2018-11-20 23:35:59 I wish I understood stocks

65 2018-11-20 23:35:15 Many a holy war has been caused by the super rich and powerful. They bank on us not seeing the true reasons so they can continue to control and manipulate the population. They cause a war , lend money for arms to both sides, with interest, then buy stocks and shares cheaply...
66 2018-11-20 23:34:46 To make it easier for the rich to buy more stocks, so they can make more money.
67 2018-11-20 23:33:19 Lol awesome. I've purchased many stocks at huge discounts. I bought FB below it's IPO Price. Twitter below it's IPO price. NFLX below $100 (before it's latest split). I could go on. I'm glad you got in on some Boeing, but you clearly have no skin in the game at this point.
68 2018-11-20 23:33:16 I keep mine aggressive until I am about 10 years from retirement.  I look at a down market of buying stocks at a large discount and when you the market goes back up.  Think about all that buying power that you had

Crypto is now finishing the bear.(capitulating), stocks have yet to start! It's going to be fun
71 2018-11-20 23:31:53 Why is @realDonaldTrump always so quick to take the credit when the markets are up, but he seems awfully quiet when #stocks tumble?

77 2018-11-20 23:30:04 Nice bit of work. Would be curious to see whether there is a way of analyzing subsequent performance of those most underweight and overweight stocks. Since it’s a zero sum exercise in aggregate are managers underweighting and overweighting the “right” stuff?

81 2018-11-20 23:27:57 Equity mkt cap of 155% = US equities effectively are the US economy.  Net cap gains + taxable IRA distribs = ~200% of annual US Pers Consumption Expenditure growth.  Means as stocks fall, consumption & tax receipts quickly follow; US tax receipt data past 20 yrs bear this out

84 2018-11-20 23:27:08 Why not just short something if you know stocks are going down
85 2018-11-20 23:26:42 Yep I took some losses mainly in Oct.  I only cut old legacy stocks (mistakes) that I had long given up on. Bizarrely some great stocks got discounted while a couple of my old duff picks stood still.  This was a good opportunity to switch positions.
86 2018-11-20 23:26:26 This could be the first true test of @Bitcoin as alternative investment with the @DowJones continuing to plunge.  In the short term, it is not performing as such with bitcoin falling along with stocks.  @GoldMarket and @Oil_Trader are down too so this is not like 2008, so far.

89 2018-11-20 23:25:00 Yes.  And yields either don't fall as much as they should, or don't fall at all, or actually rise as stocks get killed (as happened in Feb & again in Oct.)  IMO Fed may have to do BOJ curve control = bond bulls would be "right" nominally, but would get killed on real basis.

123 2018-11-20 23:13:00 Oh wow huge Black Friday deals this year on stocks
124 2018-11-20 23:12:53 Jamaica’s wasting time: adding to above, Jamaica should focus large share of its SME investment on dominating in Cannabis startups. A network of dispensaries could foreshadow a network of microlenders. JA could leverage crosslistings; dominate global listings of Cannabis stocks!
125 2018-11-20 23:12:18 Economy is doing great but stocks are taking a bleeding. Part is i think people are getting tired of google, apple, amazon, netflix tricks
126 2018-11-20 23:12:11 My 401k is down 10% this year. Tariff wars have hurt a couple of stocks plus global economy not doing great for my funds. Since I can’t work anymore, sure would be nice if 401k was going up. 1st year or so usually are carry over from previous  admin so Trump is going backwards.
127 2018-11-20 23:11:37 It's a lot of pain if you own the FAANGs. I talk about it in this week's Market Edge Podcast. It's a real "crash" in some of those stocks. But if you own the indexes, it's not that bad.
128 2018-11-20 23:11:23 Early 2017 I remember not buying Bitcoin because I thought it was over valued at $500. Within 2 months it was $3k. Another 6 months $20k. People are in panic at $BTC going down to $4k but it's still good ROI if you bought at $500. You don't get that in stocks or real estate!
129 2018-11-20 23:11:13 Much appreciated. Spent the weekend charting out stocks. Finding this all very fascinating. Cheers
130 2018-11-20 23:10:39 Bonds and spreads are following stocks which seems to be how these pullbacks typically play out.

People are freaking out over a potential GE downgeade but given it's already trading like junk that also seems like a tail wagging the dog scenario.
131 2018-11-20 23:10:29 But your "original point" was a reply to my original point which was about Ivanka's private emails. Stocks or no stocks, Ivanka has emails. Why aren't Republicans chanting "Lock 'er up?"
132 2018-11-20 23:10:20 Stocks fell today, wiping out ALL 2018 gains. Tell me again @realDonaldTrump how magnificent my 401K is because of YOU?
133 2018-11-20 23:10:15 You are right to certain degree. However, the very reason why stocks in general are coming down is the fact that they cannot fill the profit targets. If U equities start making money and good profits, they will start going up no matter what other stocks do.

135 2018-11-20 23:10:00 Jim Cramer (CNBC) says stocks have “collapsed “. Not true, averages are down around 12 percent. Thank God they are, we were long overdue for a sell off. It’s what markets do. We still have at least another 4000 Dow points down to go. Be patient, it’s all normal and healthy.
136 2018-11-20 23:09:30 Brokerage account or twitter account? And you talkin BTC, Oil, Stocks, Pokemon trading cards... anyone want to make side bets on Ramp's portfolio. I've seen this in a movie before... it all works out great.
137 2018-11-20 23:09:20 What is happening to the tech stocks?

139 2018-11-20 23:09:15 The only way to know if we're in a bear market is when we're in a bear market lol.  So far, the $SPX is down 10.1% from its all-time high.  If this turns out to be a bear market, we've still got a ways to go to the downside.  The carnage in the FANG-type stocks was long overdue.

144 2018-11-20 23:05:57 What macro indicators are you looking for to signal a time to invest again? What if stocks rebound 5-10% or more on no news? At what point do you get back in versus feel you've missed it and stay on the sidelines?

This is why timing is a losers game.
145 2018-11-20 23:05:37 @SarahSpain @jasonfitz I totally agree with you Sarah that defense from both teams made a ton of plays Aaron Donald I think raised his stocks in MVP voting

151 2018-11-20 23:03:45 Somebody needs to tell trump to do whatever the NRA says since Trump just banned bump stocks against the NRA wishes. Please provide an article where the NRA tells the GOP what to do. Thanks.
152 2018-11-20 23:03:40 End of day tone in the OEX stocks was actually worse today than yday ... NDX slightly better but still fugly.
153 2018-11-20 23:03:07 Yeah that's probably the easier way to do it. Not saying it's easy, but it's easier. Down the road you'll look back at this time & remember how you felt, the emotions, etc. & that will help you. These stretches make you better as a net-buyer of stocks.
154 2018-11-20 23:03:05 Haha , yeah can't buy stocks for couple bucks .  But you can for couple hundreds . Idk thats where the real money is
155 2018-11-20 23:02:59 What?  It's over. Money best invested now in alternative currencies.  Silver gold ethereum will be best asset classes next 3-8 years.  Stocks headed down to prior wave 4 (70% drop)

158 2018-11-20 23:01:39 The "correct" stocks are having a "correction." They are the most overbought large cap growth stocks. That's not unusual. Small caps aren't even close to what the NASDAQ has been doing.

168 2018-11-20 22:57:48 For whatever reason, $TIP auctions can really weigh on markets. Tomorrow’s 10yr TIP pre-TG auction will get a nice concession, should stocks behave themselves even the slightest bit.
169 2018-11-20 22:56:34 Stocks will likely take more of a hit in 2019 as the juice from lower tax rates fades out and tariffs really start hitting. Along with interest rate increases. Giggity.

171 2018-11-20 22:56:05 Oooo! Finally I get to use the  emoji! 

RT @BlueVote2020: Everything Trump touches ... 

Tuesday's slide compounded Monday's losses on the Dow, resulting in a two-day losing streak of about 950 
points, or 4 percent. Stocks fell 2.2 percent on the Dow on Tuesday (1/2)
172 2018-11-20 22:55:54 Good point, thanks for the response! It is amazing that people are still “rotating” out of blowing up stocks into others, instead of simply selling and going to cash! Wonder what it will take to change investor behavior.
173 2018-11-20 22:55:41 How do i buy stocks? Someone help me
174 2018-11-20 22:55:07 U.S. stocks closes lower on Tuesday 11/20/2018. $DJIA -2.21% (-551.8) at 24,465.64, $SPX -1.82% (-48.8) at 2,641.89, $COMPQ -1.70% (-119.6) at 6,908.82.
175 2018-11-20 22:54:48 Ha you will see when stocks come back soon.
176 2018-11-20 22:54:07 Not that many care about this (not today), but one of my portfolio's core holdings, TechnologyOne $TNE, once again released a high quality, high growth, solid FY18 report yesterday. Keep this in mind #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stockstowatch #equities #stocks
177 2018-11-20 22:53:51 That’s interesting. I remember seeing an article about warren buffet selling a massive amount of amazon stocks right before it boomed. That might not be  accurate but you get the point

179 2018-11-20 22:53:23 Key Observations : 
1. Nasdaq has undercut oct lows while s&p and dowjones indexes are testing October lows (double bottom)
2. All indexes have turned red for the year (nasdaq is barely green for year)
3. FAANG stocks (frothy gang of stocks) has lost 1 Trillion $ in market cap. .

184 2018-11-20 22:51:43 Nope, I started investing about 2.5 years ago when oil was low and stocks like PMO was 19p GLEN 60p so I did fairly well but now seems everything’s going down. If you could add me to the group please
185 2018-11-20 22:51:28 The collapse of the FAANG stocks has more to do with their bias and censorship than a problem with the economy.
186 2018-11-20 22:51:04 Glitch Week is usually sometime in May—we ship out so much (to our warehouse manager's delight) that we have to rebuild the glitch stocks after each one, so it's hard to do more than one a year
187 2018-11-20 22:50:48 New to what? Trading? Crypto or this guy? When someone complains about a system that is around a week old, of course there is going to be kinks. Complaining where your investment lies is the opposite of smart. Go back to stocks.
188 2018-11-20 22:50:41 Profits rising 28%, but stocks are being shorted, in part, because rising wages are cutting into record profits.

I don't get it. 
189 2018-11-20 22:49:55 i've been involved with the markets since the dawn of the internet bubble. i didn't feel like things were all that out of hand this time around. but i guess it was enough given the backdrop of our horribly broken fiscal, monetary and political systems. $SPY #stocks
190 2018-11-20 22:49:00 You mean the low unemployment, the faster growth or the high stocks? There is no statu quo. There is either independence or remain tied to an ever closer empire project. If you want to live in the EU, you can move there.
191 2018-11-20 22:48:55 The woman in front of me on the plane spent the whole time looking at stocks, checking the teaparty website and texting her family about how her son got invited to Mar-a-Lago with the Trumps.

Im never flying into Dulles ever again
192 2018-11-20 22:47:45 Exactly what they want to do, 
Apparently the fishing industry can support a doubling of TAC according to the Tories when we 'take back control', it's clear they want to decimate the largely recovered stocks again. despite the fact it took decades of controls to achieve recovery.
193 2018-11-20 22:46:58 Agree on an event trigger but why do rates have to plunge at sign of fear? Maybe stocks and bonds sell off, particularly if it’s not a deflationary recession.
194 2018-11-20 22:45:42 I guess it’s time to sell stocks and buy more #bitcoin.
195 2018-11-20 22:45:28 Lol @ partisan hacks thinking they're financial wizards. Tech stocks are the biggest culprit for this current drop, it has nothing to do with the Democrats taking the house. No one that isn't up Trump's ass has even suggested as much.
196 2018-11-20 22:45:26 why is cheaper cheap?
leading stocks move 70 pct off cycle highs. whats the brand name going to be? whats the cache to a commodity without his touch? Did he sign an NDA? can he start something else? many questions.....
197 2018-11-20 22:45:22 Definitely a challenging season. Certainly makes people reevaluate stored feed stocks.
198 2018-11-20 22:44:47 Looking at the stock market bleeding today reminds me of Mark Twain's quote: "October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February."
199 2018-11-20 22:44:35 Interesting to see Buffett has been buying banks. Looming debt crisis doesn’t seem to be of concern. Maybe higher interest rates and rotation from stocks back into cash is too much of a draw. Who knows

202 2018-11-20 22:43:56 The stock market dropped 552 points on Tuesday nearly 400 points on Monday as well. The Dow is nearly 2,500 points off its peak.

203 2018-11-20 22:43:42 What I don’t need to live on, I put into a little TDAmeritrade account ~ $12K where I try to invest in dividend stocks.
204 2018-11-20 22:43:31 Where do stocks bottom? The consumer, that's the rub. #Stockmarket / #economic sectors are all important for various reasons, but the US consumer is king of the hill. $PG $KO $PEP $WMT are the 4 largest parts of one sector ETF ( $XLP ) and those (and $AAPL) bear watching.

220 2018-11-20 22:38:36 Broad market indicators are mixed on the pressure gauge. Not mad at what I am seeing but more so the extremes in single stocks is pretty wild. I hope to have more concrete data shortly but will absolutely have past examples I have used, how, why etc.
221 2018-11-20 22:38:35 And this is a forecast of what to come when Democrats take over. People are pulling their stocks or not trading or selling off so they don’t lose money when the Democrats take over and start their destruction of the economy again.
222 2018-11-20 22:38:12 Surprised at how little people that follow you trade stocks or forex.
223 2018-11-20 22:37:45 Retweeting because the thread got messed up. Thought I lost it. Every day the system generates about 100 signals (at least in this market). The upside ones have been way less (5 at best. That is the overall principle yes, but better results on single stocks when market is stable
224 2018-11-20 22:37:02 What the fuck, that's why I didn't get into yet. These niggas be lying. What about pdt trading rules like stocks. Can I where and exit a trade as frequent as I want?
225 2018-11-20 22:36:32 It was brutal in 2008 buying the dip a little early, but taking a step back and looking at it, It worked out and people’s short term money shouldn’t be in stocks anyways.  Nobody makes a profit panicking.
226 2018-11-20 22:36:08 To start with, ban on bump stocks that the republicans rejected even after Vegas shooting. Raise age limit, registration, insurance, end private sales that don’t require same background check. Ban sales of certain bullets, limit magazine capacity, mandatory gun safety courses.
227 2018-11-20 22:36:05 Crypto != stocks.. why try and compare the two..
228 2018-11-20 22:35:42 Might be due to what you invested in. I was talking about Dow Jones, NASDAQ & S&P only, not individual stocks or funds.

239 2018-11-20 22:33:44 Not really - that would depend on which stocks you were focusing on. The broad market decline began in early October, and for short-sellers was like shooting fish in a barrel. I nailed it.
240 2018-11-20 22:31:43 If investing were easy a monkey or rather a computer could do it. Tbonds aren’t acting as well as the “press the button” people want. I suspect it’s just building energy for the big move which should come when stocks truly break down.
241 2018-11-20 22:31:11 There are a bunch of people who died in Las Vegas who would disagree with you about bump stocks
242 2018-11-20 22:29:52 Trade stocks and fuck thots
243 2018-11-20 22:29:32 It’s a good time to buy pot stocks
244 2018-11-20 22:28:44 Time is less important than price. I don't think there will be a true bottom until BTC triple digits--most cryptos will go to ~0 & BTC will never return to 2017 levels. DLT is the growth industry--the equivalent of the internet vs. the cryptocurrencies that are dotcom stocks.
245 2018-11-20 22:28:26 Sometimes stock markets fall because investors panic. These are great buying opportunities. Other times they fall because the underlying fundamentals are weakening. These drops tend to extend further. #correction #stocks #investing
246 2018-11-20 22:28:04 Did anyone honestly believe that stocks could grow forever? Ask $BTC how that idea is working out.
247 2018-11-20 22:27:41 The gay man Tim Cook out there killing Apple stocks and slowly but surely burying the company into oblivion. Apple will only recover once the gay man steps out.
248 2018-11-20 22:27:34 @LandM_Marius Q: What do you get after a crypto bear market? A: Bull. Q: What do you get after a stocks bull market? A: Bear. This is the set up to be bullish on #bitcoin & #Cryptos and bearish on equities.
249 2018-11-20 22:26:49 @realDonaldTrump is now bad for stocks. Also miscalculating how bad of a move it is to stand with Stinky Saudi on this #KhashoggiMurder. Def will affect his numbers 2020
250 2018-11-20 22:26:00 Do any models own stocks? Super curious. Or invest in something steadily rising?
251 2018-11-20 22:25:40 As I said, changing magazines can be done so quickly you can’t tell how many shots are being fired. I have no argument against banning bump stocks. They rarely work very well anyway. What does hair clips have to do with this discussion?
252 2018-11-20 22:25:29 How many millions have you made? And what investments do you have? Any drug stocks that do animal testing? Or oil stocks dont say oh my accountant handles that let's see your portfolio and tax returns I'll bet your full of it little preaching hippocrate hollwood perverts maga
253 2018-11-20 22:25:23 Thinking back to last Xmas and how many supermarkets reduced their vegan food stocks to make more room for all the bird carcasses. Seems to be happening again. Do we honestly not know how to celebrate without killing millions of animals who don't want to die? Smh
254 2018-11-20 22:24:49 They 100% can and this is personally why I didn't invest is weed stocks myself. I knew this was coming.
255 2018-11-20 22:24:15 The CNBC tv traders were even pushing oil stocks after the crude runup to $90!! THAT CALL WAS SO LATE! You NEVER jump on AFTER massive runups! THEIR OIL STOCK PICKS HAVE NOW BEEN CRUSHED. & Despite Pres Trump calling for more drilling/production around the globe & here in US!!!
256 2018-11-20 22:23:37 ptdrr jpense que jvais aller faire quelques minutes de sophrologie pour repenser la façon de gérer les stocks
257 2018-11-20 22:23:26 You could buy stocks
258 2018-11-20 22:23:22 The gambler in me wants to dig in stocks
259 2018-11-20 22:23:03 I got vaporized today but I go on...once more unto the breach lads.

#stocks #uranium #gold
260 2018-11-20 22:22:56 Clarifying points - I would include semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15 - while you are at it go ahead and get the bump stocks too

CA has a magazine restriction at 10; with multiple clips - reduced prolonged shooting time, increased reloading would be helpful. My 1911 is 7+1
261 2018-11-20 22:22:54 Hypothetically, Time does trump and stocks fall 70%.
262 2018-11-20 22:21:09 Retail stocks have crashed the last 2 wks. Consumers are spending but store profit margins squeezed by higher costs incl wages. Is selling overdone? Tues movers:

L Brands $LB -17.7%
Target $TGT -10.5
Ross $ROST -9.4
Kohl's $KSS -9.2
$TJX -4.4
$CVS -3.9
Macy's $M -3.4
$WMT -2.7
263 2018-11-20 22:20:12 Same place the fish gets it from. And a broad based spectrum of Omegas. More importantly sustainability is number one. Depleted fish stocks not affected. Win win win for everyone but the algae 
264 2018-11-20 22:19:53 There's no excuse for him banning people who pay him money just because they made a harmless joke. No other streamer aside from laughing stocks like wings, LTG or DSP act like this
265 2018-11-20 22:19:35 Cuz tech stocks are the "real" economy 
266 2018-11-20 22:19:14 damn i be losing followers like gamestop loses stocks
267 2018-11-20 22:17:39 When Dian Fossey wants to  buy  boffo stocks she  calls 555-Issuers for the best results.
268 2018-11-20 22:16:11 But what about the Las Vegas shooting. He was using bump stocks wasn’t he? Look at the damage he did. The lives lost and injured and forever changed.
Just wondering not arguing.
269 2018-11-20 22:16:02 When the market is up, everyone says it is doing what it’s supposed to. When it goes down, there is #confusion about what is going on...it’s still just being a #market, and you could be missing your opportunity to get assets on sale #investing #volatility #stocks #money #planning
270 2018-11-20 22:15:20 GOP/Trump tax cut led to $1Trillion gov debt, increasing amount US borrows, raising interest rates, causing stocks to fall. Continued Trump Tarrifs & Trade War have caused them to fall even further. Stock market is not the economy, but it is a leading indicator of its future.
271 2018-11-20 22:14:30 Yes, shipping will be on queue depending on who paid shipping fee first. 

Note that the items have limited stocks. First to pay, secures the item.
272 2018-11-20 22:14:24 Cats can’t own stocks!!
273 2018-11-20 22:14:11 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
274 2018-11-20 22:13:54 They will go down initially because they are stocks. The question is will the fundamentals change? If no, then buy more on weakness.
275 2018-11-20 22:13:27 How long can Trump keep talking about economy. With stocks going way down businesses are going to be skeptical about growing
276 2018-11-20 22:13:21 Can I interest you instead of stocks, maybe a nice timeshare instead?
277 2018-11-20 22:12:59 So any Canadian buying US Marijuana stocks could essentially be banned - IF the border knows their stock portfolio?!? Okay, that makes sense. 
278 2018-11-20 22:12:54 I’m 22. How does someone my age get into stocks 
279 2018-11-20 22:12:47 Put simply, stocks have already started to price in the risk of an economic slowdown," Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote to clients on Tuesday.
Looks like we have ridden as far as can from President Obama's genius.
280 2018-11-20 22:12:31 All new traders who started in last 2years . Unfortunately your first exposure to mkt most likely was small cap stocks that were pumped during rabid bull mkt . Question is , 2 yrs later where has it got you . It’s almost 2019 . How much more time will you waste ? Fair question
281 2018-11-20 22:12:26 I think people forgot I flip stocks 
282 2018-11-20 22:12:04 Put her in the stocks!
283 2018-11-20 22:11:53 Bank stocks are plummeting.
284 2018-11-20 22:11:05 @UNTUCKit Hey there! Your shirts caught my eye. I’m a woman so how does your line of clothes fit that demographic? Any brick and mortar stores I can check out that stocks your product?
285 2018-11-20 22:10:50 OMG this is what someone I know said to me. She’s controlled by her so called “Godly” husband. This Godly man loves his stocks cozies up to his ex wife bcuz she’s $ smart. He flirts around & never gives of himself unless he’s after something from them.  He is a white male age 70
286 2018-11-20 22:10:44 puh-lease lets not compare Greninja to that thing, ZSS ladder combos on Town and City are so dumb they remove multiple stocks at once
287 2018-11-20 22:10:28 That's way more than what he needs in his bank account , most banks only insure up to $250,000, most his money is probably in stocks,bonds or hedge funds
288 2018-11-20 22:10:20 PM Mkt: #Corn -1; #Soybeans +7; Winter #Wheat -1. YSB reversed to the upside on US Econ Advisor Kudlow's optimistic opinion on a US/China trade deal. Ethanol production & stocks data tomorrow. #CBOT open normal hours Wednesday.
289 2018-11-20 22:10:05 @lidlfrance j'ai froid il serait temps de proposer les couvertures chauffantes et les chaussons chauffants que j'ai raté l'année dernière à cause des stocks ridicules de mon magasin !! Et sinon ça va ?
290 2018-11-20 22:09:57 None of those stocks sold off.  They held up well after the rip off open.
291 2018-11-20 22:09:37 take them stocks out it’s 30 or better szn
292 2018-11-20 22:09:26 The stock market struggles may seem incongruous with an American economy that by many measures looks strong. But stocks often act as an early warning system, picking up subtle changes before they appear in the economic data.
293 2018-11-20 22:08:31 Have you paid attention to the stocks?? Whaaa whaaaa
294 2018-11-20 22:07:55 The anti-beta ETF $BTAL has done well YTD, up 11.2%. It buys low beta stocks and shorts high beta ones (not sure of the details).
295 2018-11-20 22:07:33 Charles has ALWAYS been open & honest when it comes to the markets and pricing being out of his control. Do not confuse crypto with stocks. Charles warned long ago of a crypto winter & the irrationality of the crypto investment space at it's young age. He is one of the good guys.
296 2018-11-20 22:07:32 To finish -  More down side either cash or  dividend stocks. Trump is the master negotiator- the market has yet to figure him out on China.
297 2018-11-20 22:06:46 Via @AP: The Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 3.7% in the last two days,  and the S&P 500 is off 3.4%. The Nasdaq, heavily populated with  technology stocks, is off 4.7%. The S&P 500 index has fallen 9.9% from the record high it set exactly two months ago. #economy
298 2018-11-20 22:05:55 What are you talking about I have health insurance and yeah I do have stocks I invest money.... And I live in California where the fires are at..... And I work at a farm.... What are you talking about haha

300 2018-11-20 22:05:27 Stock Market Has Only One Job ...
... to make a fool of anyone who is conceited enough to predict its short-term direction.

By the way, the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) have collectively lost $1 trillion in market value from their 52-week highs.
301 2018-11-20 22:04:52 Meal Spreads maybe.  Won't solve the Corn stocks from building, if ethanol production slows dramatically.
302 2018-11-20 22:04:32 Since the #Fed is selling securities at a rapid pace, it is shrinking the monetary base at a rate that has not occurred since the Great Depression!  The combination of base contraction and rate increases is highly contractionary.#Bullard #Kramer #stocks #rates #Recession #Powell
303 2018-11-20 22:04:14 Heather you don’t need to waste your breadth on these guys. Everyone recognizes their ridiculous lies. Khamenei and Zarif have turned themselves into the laughing stocks of the world.
304 2018-11-20 22:03:59 We have selection boxes for the first few people to come to our PTA Christmas Fayre wearing a Christmas Jumper!!! While stocks last so get there fast. Doors open 11.00 next Saturday morning 24th in the school. Entry is £1.00 at the door.
305 2018-11-20 22:03:43 The Boeing Company (BA) price at close, 2018-11-20, is 315.685. #boeing #stocks #NYSE #space
306 2018-11-20 22:02:54 Lowest unemployment for blacks and Hispanics in history..coincidence?  I don’t think so but yes anyone with stocks have benefited from a Trumps America..even yours I’m sure 
307 2018-11-20 22:02:43 Correct me if I’m mistaken but stocks are valued differently to market cap no? Regardless I agree with you, 95% of the crypto projects won’t be around in 5 years time.
308 2018-11-20 22:02:27 Go get yourself a rake &contribute 2 Making America Rake Again! Calling me an idiot hv u seen ur 401k? Or do u hv 1? Got stocks?  2 shovel coal?  giving billion 2 farmers? Oh yeah a kidney infection th/results in double d's. Yup he's rich no taxes 2 prove it. Ur a schmuck!
309 2018-11-20 22:01:50 Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2018-11-20, is 347.49. #teslamotors #tesla #stocks #NASDAQ #elonmusk
310 2018-11-20 22:01:31 What are the rules if it is stocks and not real estate? If one person commits insider trading do we prosecute? Is there a minimum number of shares? I really don’t know the answers to those questions.
311 2018-11-20 22:01:27 Invest in penny stocks ...rejoice in a 2% ripper. Eat turkey, relax

313 2018-11-20 22:01:15 Dot Com Bubble Bursts Yet Again! Nearly 18 years after it happened the first time. Stocks in Apple etc at over inflated speculator prices are unsustainable.
314 2018-11-20 22:00:18 Stock drop: $EAST and 53 other stocks drop. The Common Wealth is investigating! Reach out for more info. TheCommonWealth.mail@gmail.com #StockDrop #EAST
315 2018-11-20 22:00:04 And that's not quite true, they have always been about to put money in riskier investments. I think the cap on stocks of 10 or 15%. (Don't quote me though) This added freedom isn't going to change much since theyve always had the option and not given it.
316 2018-11-20 21:59:35 The wealthiest 10% own 93% of all stocks. I'm gonna say for the better part of 90% of America, the stock market and all thier elitist media surrogates are thieves. We grow your food, keep your heat on, build your homes and fight your wars AND WE WON'T FORGET WHAT YOU HAVE STOLEN.
317 2018-11-20 21:59:24 Fiscally and economicly he is a genius America is smashing boundaries on the market even if we do have a bear market at present its time to restock value stocks. I don't care if people hate him he's not so bad
318 2018-11-20 21:59:12 Not enough money for food? Invest in stocks. You get free steak dinners at the shareholder's meetings.
319 2018-11-20 21:59:07 If anyone thinks the dropping stock market is due to our economy it’s not. It’s due to the over valued liberal media monopolies that were used to brainwash people stocks tanking. Don’t lose any sleep over this.
320 2018-11-20 21:59:01 Institutions and are incentivized to supress and delay. The impression I'm getting is that the SEC / whales are acting as gatekeepers to ensure the optimum entry of institutional money (max ROI). HODL should now be a matter of ethical principal, not just money. Stocks are dying!
321 2018-11-20 21:58:04 $LB, $JEC, $TGT, $ROST, and $KSS were the top five stocks that closed lower today.
322 2018-11-20 21:57:49 Stock market twitter makes me never want to trade stocks
323 2018-11-20 21:57:45 Is the economy doing well? What are the FDI in non oil sector? What about our stocks? 

Dont come here and be forming some pseudo intellectual you are foolish and i wont waste my time on enemies of my nation who only praise FG and avoid constructive criticism
324 2018-11-20 21:56:56 $A, $CPB, $ADI, $AMAT, and $NVDA were the top five stocks that closed higher today.

327 2018-11-20 21:55:40 $GE, $AMD, $BAC, $AAPL, and $MSFT were the top five most active stocks today.
328 2018-11-20 21:55:12 Haven’t looked but I’d bet that $TSLA has been one of the best performing stocks in this rout
329 2018-11-20 21:55:00 It's hard to work out how a Trillion dollars can just evaporate. 
FAANG stocks have lost $1 trillion from their recent highs. 
Good luck with Super statements and 401ks next June.
330 2018-11-20 21:54:49 On the year this is 2nd time stocks have been minus on the year. Trumps stock market most unstable in history and some people are making a lot of money from it
331 2018-11-20 21:54:45 Now that I own stocks I feel like I’m an adult maybe I’m wrong idk
332 2018-11-20 21:54:30 Crazy disconnects make trading this thing rough.  When this happens, I move money in the retirement accts but leave the daytrading to when the markets line up.  Today bonds were flat while stocks were down 1.5 and oil down 6.  Stuff like that everyday makes analysis impossible.
333 2018-11-20 21:54:25 $FB Fang stocks lost a trillion. These lead market up and now down. When they bottom market goes up.Simple.$FNGU $AAPL $NFLX $SPY
334 2018-11-20 21:53:56 Right about now, I'd buy oil stocks like $USO $usou. Oil is gonna go up
335 2018-11-20 21:53:37 Earnings expectations have been managed, analysts have lowered targets, stocks have dumped. EPS surprise season starts in a week. Sell the rip when it comes.
336 2018-11-20 21:52:59 The Ayrshire shops, are running out of popcorn to follow this pantomime. How's the popcorn stocks in the Paisley area.  I need to replenish and stock up for the political treats, attractions and shows to come Mhairi. 
337 2018-11-20 21:51:52 Tech stocks are crazy low it's frustrating
338 2018-11-20 21:51:51 Me too. As of today my stocks are down 20% from my high. I have always said I am in for the long haul but I admit I am scared. I have more in cash than stock but the stock is fun for me.  Should I convert all to cash or wait it out. It will come back, always does?
339 2018-11-20 21:51:51 The curse of the out of stocks as well as contractors making a loss when they dispense branded generics!
340 2018-11-20 21:51:33 Got a couple of ‘told you so’ tweets of yore about getting TF outta FAANG stocks. I will RT myself at the point where the gloat levels are at all time highs 
341 2018-11-20 21:51:13 @hks55 : "One of the most telegraphed bear markets I’ve ever seen. First EM currencies started to tank, then metals, Ags, then EM stocks.

343 2018-11-20 21:51:03 I recently met a client who's life was being dictated by the performance of a portfolio of 12 stocks. Ludicrous. Take control. Diversify. Put in place a strategy and game plan. He's now a client

347 2018-11-20 21:49:51 We hear about TARIFFS.
We hear about the FED & INTEREST RATES.
We hear about OIL PRICES. 
We hear every excuse in the books for the stock market decline.
But has anyone else noticed what the BIG HEADS aren't talking about?
SHORT SELLERS!

Please RETWEET if u agree!

348 2018-11-20 21:48:49 Lower oil prices sound good on the surface, and airlines love it, but energy stocks are getting hammered, and it’s a sign of slowing global growth.  Gonna go get cathartic with my guitar and some Pink Floyd and Led Zep. The neighbors will love it;)

350 2018-11-20 21:44:50 Two groups of common shareholders: smart money and dumb money. So as stocks they share certain characteristics. Could that be the answer?
351 2018-11-20 21:44:07 Investors tend to over-analyze when stocks are going down (fear) and under-analyze when stocks are going up (greed).
352 2018-11-20 21:43:55 This market hurts, but it's still a long way from bear-mkt territory by the classic -20% yardstick.

Index declines from peaks:

Dow -9.3%
S&P 500 -10.2
S&P mid-cap -11.9
Nasdaq -15.1
Russell 2000 -15.7

Still a lot of individual stocks in bear mkts, though. Esp techs.
353 2018-11-20 21:43:36 Tech Industry Stocks Are Fueling A Drop In The Markets
354 2018-11-20 21:43:11 Yeah, for some odd reason people believe that bump stocks make the gun more accurate, magazines are really clips, and that a semiautomatic can fire faster than a fully automatic, or that full semiautomatic is somehow a thing.
355 2018-11-20 21:42:54 The problem with smash 4 was killing consistently is too hard and getting people to kill % was too easy. Also 2 stocks and rage are trash
356 2018-11-20 21:42:46 I absolutely hate spitting. They should put offenders in stocks and we should all throw my cooking at them. Actually, scrub that: throw my ex MIL’s cooking at them. Or is that too far?

358 2018-11-20 21:42:36 Companies are buying back stocks at record numbers “tax cuts” which will decrease volume. 401k’s suffer greatly and your so called “buying opportunities” decrease rapidly. So your statement is undeniably false.

360 2018-11-20 21:41:59 Entry from my "badpolicy" list: bump stocks
361 2018-11-20 21:41:57 I did a show-up-once-a-year gig with Foncalieu: 1 client, 400,000bt. They were brilliant. They'd monitor our stocks, place the orders and organise the shipping. I behaved like the man from del Monte, giving it the 55% of this, 45% of that bullshit. The price was ridiculous.
362 2018-11-20 21:40:29 If I had a handgun and you had an AR with a bump stock, guess who is getting shot first? Bump stocks are horrible, they're so inaccurate. Fun but useless.dont believe the hype, the media is full of it
363 2018-11-20 21:40:19 The Dow fell by 648 points at its session low, and closed at 24,465.  
Market gains for 2018 wiped out by plunging stocks.  Yeah BOOM

377 2018-11-20 21:36:01 @CNN Now everyone will be clamoring for the Fed to stop raising interest rates but again Fed should not cater to the stock market. Stocks were propped up for 10 years by artificial stimulus.  Time for reality now.  With risk comes losses.  If you want no risk buy Treasuries.
378 2018-11-20 21:35:42 When business writers write about stocks they always put “full disclosure“ if they own the stock or not. I’ve always liked that. It clears the air for the readers to decide what’s really behind their content if anything. Bias or not. Just my perspective on this.

386 2018-11-20 21:34:33 Stu - You know damn well the democrats winning has nothing to do with the market crash. The day after the election the market went up. This is because of Tech stocks and the trade war. Stop lying to the people, otherwise all you are is propaganda.
387 2018-11-20 21:34:04 I'm not sure if Trump knows that he is making it much harder for the Fed to pause interest rate hikes with all the bashing. Or if it's just more important for him to have a fall guy to blame for stocks.
388 2018-11-20 21:33:57 Markets just closed. The Dow is down −551.80 (2.21%) That's a drop of 950 pts. in 2 days.

413 2018-11-20 21:24:51 Stocks were way over valued and we had a few huge tech companies making up most of the value of the Stock Exchange. 
Thats a recipe for disaster.  Why were big tech monopolies not broken up?

The one thing I’ve noticed in past market sell offs is that each stock normally meets its bottom at different periods, if you don’t recognize it, you miss that stocks bottom. sell off is well below USA economy and will shoot back up sooner than later
457 2018-11-20 21:08:29 No one sees recession in the next year or so. Yet they are dumping stocks like we are back in 2008. So who is selling. Maybe you should interview those people. @CNBC $SPY

483 2018-11-20 21:03:28 in one of your free seminars you talked about this and I did some digging and I found a book that did some research on this topic and it says that these type of stocks on average have a drawdown of 90%.  I just cant imaging losing 90% of my capital....
484 2018-11-20 21:02:57 First day that bonds shrugged at stocks.
485 2018-11-20 21:02:44 Dang! That was faster than I predicted! I own no stocks and haven’t a clue how it works. But as I said in 2000 when we got a home loan even though we were 5 months behind on another and only make $ for 1 “this ain’t right”.
486 2018-11-20 21:02:42 cute stocks
487 2018-11-20 21:02:26 Well, I've officially started shorting.  Never could get TD to find #potstocks to short, but I did short some non-pot stocks.  I have to say:  Trading outside the cannabis sector is way less stressful!

492 2018-11-20 21:01:16 >> Investing in penny stocks is a nearly  zero-sum game, which mostly pumps money from late investors to early ones.   Investing in crypto is a VERY negative-sum game, like a lottery: >>

495 2018-11-20 21:00:08 Don't be so sure...the world is changing.  Everyone thought internet stocks were going to zero after the Nasdaq imploded in 2000...enough said.
496 2018-11-20 20:59:43 The single biggest holder of tech stocks is Saudi Arabia. On the verge of being sanctioned over killed reporter, is it too wild to assume that they’re liquidating their US stocks before their assets are frozen due to sanction?
497 2018-11-20 20:59:24 The $FAANG stocks have lost a combined $800 BILLION DOLLARS
498 2018-11-20 20:59:08 All things I have predicted coming true. The Stock Market will continue to crash thus erasing all Trumpian profit margin. Dont invest in Facebook and Twitter. The Govt will split their companies up in 2019 to break up monopoly over Social Media. Tech Stocks will become worthless.
499 2018-11-20 20:58:47 >> But cryptos are in fact much worse than penny stocks.  Apart from being issued and traded without regard for the regulations that apply to stocks, there are the miners who continuously sell coins that they didn't buy. >>

504 2018-11-20 20:56:55 I am hopeful Roger has a rabbit up his sleeve that explains his stocks dismal performance.  It is possible that a split is coming and therefore, to some extent, a shorts dream come true until the announcement due to stagnation of current holders.  We will see.
505 2018-11-20 20:56:42 @realDonaldTrump stocks are tanking thanks to your idiotic policies, you’re ok with Saudi prince ordering death of journalist, waste of $ deployment of soldiers to border as stunt, Ivanka used private email for WH business #LockHerUpIvanka #trumpsucks #TrumpCrimeFamily #ResignNow
506 2018-11-20 20:56:40 >> Smart investors don't put money into penny stocks.  Penny stock investors are only idiots who don't know what makes stocks valuable, or swindlers who hope to take the money from those idiots. >>
507 2018-11-20 20:55:56 This move was too swift to be just capitulation, looks more like forced selling by professional.
Look at the big picture, markets are crashing everywhere. The latest was stocks, but it has been happening for weeks in different markets.
My guess is funds needed cash asap & dumped.

509 2018-11-20 20:55:48 Man it is so OBVIOUS that the real whales want to come in at LOW prices. Watch the stocks and equities CRASH right now as they leave that space and come into where the wealth transfer will happen. Simple.

512 2018-11-20 20:53:59 Like cryptos, penny stocks are just numbers in a ledger.  They can be traded, and some may even make profit from doing so.  But the only money that goes into the penny stock trading game is what investors put in; so, overall, they cannot take out more than they invested. >>
513 2018-11-20 20:53:24 Trump: "Your tech stocks have some problems"
514 2018-11-20 20:53:20 No wonder stocks are going down the past 2 weeks
515 2018-11-20 20:53:07 its not a marker of the UK economy..80 per cent of the money eanred by FTSE 100 companies is generated outsider the UK...the FTSE is falling because the mining stocks and the oil price are lower..

521 2018-11-20 20:51:40 The catchy lyrics, "Bad buy, bad buy, what U going to do when nothing to invest into" seriously is showing itself today. Stocks down, oil down, gold down, bonds down, real estate down, banks down, futures down. As mentioned, holding large cash is hard & danger of instability. Hmm
522 2018-11-20 20:51:31 Both are currencies, with wide acceptance and Central Banks that stabilize their value.  Cryptos are not currencies, in spite of what their fans claim.  They most closely resemble penny stocks -- shares of failed companies with no assets, products, contracts, revenue, profits. >>
523 2018-11-20 20:51:25 What you reckon he'll do?

We know he needs out of certain EU constraints for his socialist utopia where they take stocks back for less than market value. But will he risk the wrath of his party for it?
524 2018-11-20 20:51:21 A few stocks have had trading volumes multiple times higer than their mcaps too recently, like HMNY.
525 2018-11-20 20:51:13 Any good investment advice?  I mean beyond the obvious popcorn, beer and of course toilet paper stocks due to so many ppl soiling themselves when more indictments drop. Reminds me I need to pick up industrial strength kitty litter if I ever come down from this cactus.  
526 2018-11-20 20:51:08 Remember that the Nasdaq also includes stocks like Pepsi and Kraft Heinz. It's not the same index as 1999.

529 2018-11-20 20:50:00 @realDonaldTrump lies again, Saudis bailed you out of trump tower debt in the early 2000’s, $ 325 MILLION @MSNBC @FoxNews stocks are dropping as he talks, 569 down and dropping
530 2018-11-20 20:49:37 Your the reason why the meme stocks are down %12 since yesterday
531 2018-11-20 20:49:25 Market losses today have wiped out the stock market's gains for the year.
The Dow dropped over 500 points, or 2.0%, Tuesday. Plunging retailers like led the S&P 500 near 2% lower. Tech stocks once again got hit hard, with the Nasdaq sinking near 2.0%.
532 2018-11-20 20:48:53 Same@with bump stocks. A one off. By itself. No strings attached. No hi cap mag proposals , etc. if politicians try to bundle -
It’s over. That’s my opinion anyway.
533 2018-11-20 20:48:49 Trump did say if democrats take bqck the house stocks would go down.
534 2018-11-20 20:48:33 Stocks are never going up again !
535 2018-11-20 20:48:30 And the VVIX is only 108? How can that be? Something is definitely weird. I would have thought we’d be flying over 110. Tells me stocks are going lower.
536 2018-11-20 20:48:04 Some low volatility stocks rarely move 20%. Some move 20% in a couple of weeks. It's utterly ridiculous.
537 2018-11-20 20:48:02 Stocks aren't the economy.
538 2018-11-20 20:47:45 Not just that. Stocks, in general, are taking a beating. But hey, look at cryptocurrency losses instead guys! GE is in big trouble with regards to its own payments but let's come together to try and figure out why crypto is falling by 30% instead.
539 2018-11-20 20:47:06 Rake your stocks to prevent forest fires. Unless it's raining. Wait, that almost makes sense ...
540 2018-11-20 20:46:39 Sure...so how are your stocks doing under Trump? Despite a huge shot in the arm, tax-wise, they are far underperforming compared to last two Dems.
541 2018-11-20 20:46:22 @MartinSLewis #mlms Will Credit effect my pension seeing as it's invested in stocks n shares?
542 2018-11-20 20:46:19 1)I could be wrong, but it seems that buying stock is for long term gains. If a company decides to engage in buybacks, they are placing faith in the future of their company’s success. Stocks rise and fall all of the time, and I would say that is why only 50% of people hold stock.
543 2018-11-20 20:46:08 I would like to remind @CNBC that the only ones who benefit from stocks are the Billionaires & Trillionaires. The Fed pretends Inflation does not exist despite food prices, for average Citizens. doubling almost every month or two. IMHO The real inflation rate is around 22% not 1%
544 2018-11-20 20:46:03 Why? If sophisticated investors were selling, wouldn’t they also be buying lots of puts, this push VIX higher? Retail can only sell stocks, they don’t even know what a put is.
545 2018-11-20 20:45:27 Sempre dá p fazer sintético. Buy SPY and short FAANG Stocks proporcionaly.
546 2018-11-20 20:45:16 @realDonaldTrump Wow, stocks are tumbling. Your base must be so pissed
547 2018-11-20 20:45:15 Real issue for stocks is a credit problem shuts down the buybacks.
548 2018-11-20 20:45:00 [Thanksgiving dinner conversation]

On the one hand my advice last year to take out a HELOC to buy crypto now looks ill-advised

On the other hand crypto is falling at the same time stocks are falling proving the space is becoming more institutionalized. And in yen terms...
549 2018-11-20 20:44:16 I thought stocks & the economy could handle rising rates just fine? At least that’s what financial influencers have been telling us since last year. For once I believe in rational markets. The sell off is justified. If you have cash  be happy to create a list of potential buys.
550 2018-11-20 20:43:52 JEFFREY GUNDLACH, CEO OF DOUBLELINE CAPITAL, SAYS U.S. STOCKS NOT IN A DEFLATIONARY BEAR MARKET BECAUSE BONDS AREN'T RALLYING AS STOCK PRICES FALL
 GUNDLACH SAYS 'WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING RESEMBLING A PANIC LOW' IN U.S. STOCKS; EVEN WITH THE SELL-OFF, MARKET IS OVERBOUGHT
551 2018-11-20 20:43:47 All market gains for 2018 wiped out by plunging stocks.
552 2018-11-20 20:43:43 Energy & tech stocks lead today's slump.

Trump says i want the price of oil to go lower.

Pardons a Turkey from death, & Mr Bonesaw for killing a journalist in 1 statement.

Just tell grandpa he's delirious again, and ship him to Florida, where the racists go to retire.
553 2018-11-20 20:43:42 Cyah have stocks if we dont have banking...and we dont have banking because...fear/lack of proactive steps to out that into play (from the regulatory bodies).


554 2018-11-20 20:43:24 sell everything, including stocks, bonds, etf, options
555 2018-11-20 20:42:19 So it looks like he’s selling out the future for a nice little economic boost, that’s going to mostly to the stock owners and other richies.  If you own stocks(I do) go ahead and celebrate him, otherwise you’re probably being short sighted.
556 2018-11-20 20:41:16 Bonds down. Stocks down. Crypto down. Commodities down. The everything bloodbath continues.
557 2018-11-20 20:41:15 Excited to join the team on @CNBCClosingBell today at 4pm. Tune in! #investing #stocks #stockmarket
558 2018-11-20 20:40:21 They better.  It’s total bs the market is down but the #FANG stocks are suddenly  fine and of course the stress is on the little guys.  They’re swimming upstream.  Where is the corporate awareness?  And who’s moving the markets so big?   If October had never come...

562 2018-11-20 20:39:01 As soon as the recession comes and stocks revert to sanity levels rates will come down........but that won't help the situation as there is just too much "debt" @realDonaldTrump

568 2018-11-20 20:38:15 @cvpayne Trying not to be into individual stocks these days. Am prepared to go into the market with fresh cash. Should I have a different attitude?
569 2018-11-20 20:37:50 Not limited to the ftse -Take a look at the Dow , and every other market and see the same thing happening .it's the start of the end as cheap free money starts  to dry up. stocks/ bonds/ house prices - all gonna drop like rocks.

572 2018-11-20 20:36:48 BTC fluctuations are like behavior of trash stocks in emerging markets. There is no inherent value to BTC (potentials of the underlying technology aside), and speculation is the main driver of its price.

577 2018-11-20 20:34:48 I don’t know why anyone is acting like this is a lot of money. 7k is one medical emergency. 50k in stocks and bonds is wayyy behind where you should be at 28 for a healthy reinterment. Not that it matters if make to Congress they get pretty good pension
578 2018-11-20 20:34:34 this is willful ignorance. Debrestion did his part. He handed over a suspect. what issue at hand is how the federal government is handling itself.

581 2018-11-20 20:33:15 I get asked a lot what we’re looking for in stocks to err on the long side vs short. My answer is breadth improvement. We’re seeing expansion in downside participation in US stocks, sectors & global indexes. When breadth improves, the “market of stocks” will drive indexes higher

594 2018-11-20 20:28:49 Well... often liquidity appears out of nowhere in these situations. There are very few stocks that I haven't been able to buy anything of with a high bid.

One in Eastern PA I had a bid for a while 2x higher than the last trade, then 3x higher, no fills.

601 2018-11-20 20:27:32 British Brexit Plan Undermined by Political Chaos
The wave of selling on Wall Street intensified Tuesday, with big losses in popular tech stocks extending the recent stock market slide and erasing the 2018 gains of the Dow and broad S&P 500 stock index.
602 2018-11-20 20:27:26 I suspect that anyone who had substantial savings in their 20s either inherited them or had tech stocks. Personally, I didn't really have savings until I was in my mid-30s and paid off all of my student loans.

608 2018-11-20 20:25:46 Guys on TV are so annoying to listen to. Just a bunch of parrots yelling "buy stocks" "good value". This market is going down. Should be buying gold / silver which are undervalued
609 2018-11-20 20:25:45 You gotta remember though buying stocks is a 5-10 year investment. Can’t think short term.
610 2018-11-20 20:25:29 trouve autre chose il est en rupture de stocks
611 2018-11-20 20:25:23 Orange dude wants low oil prices, low rates 

So weaker dollar and higher stocks. Got it.
612 2018-11-20 20:25:14 Steve, could you please make a post about why is not a good idea to short stocks? I have heard that a lot, but nobody tells me the reason.
613 2018-11-20 20:25:00 You’ll be kicking yourselves next week when everything rebounds and you didn’t buy your favorite stocks this week at a HUGE DISCOUNT! $HIPH $CYBF

615 2018-11-20 20:24:31 Did stocks fall because  libs took house? Just asking?
616 2018-11-20 20:24:10 À 14h52 j'étais dans les frigo en train de faire les stocks de golden. Quand j'ai vu l'heure j'ai sprinté jusqu'au bureau j'ai failli manger un transpalette en pleine face.
617 2018-11-20 20:24:00 Right now is the time to buy stocks, them shits are 50% off

619 2018-11-20 20:23:38 I’m not American...but heard you have a rack of guns for sale...at your stores?  That you’ve raised the age to buy to 21..and you no longer stock bump stocks.  Good job...would be better if you pulled the lot from your shelves though. The school kids would be pleased.
620 2018-11-20 20:23:28 @AnitaSharma US retail stocks maybe on sale but they are a falling knife as consumers are so loaded with debt and can't afford things like they used to. Interest rates are rising, DON'T CATCH A FALLING KNIFE!
621 2018-11-20 20:23:04 wow big drop in US 10 year yield! A month ago it moved toward 3.3% but now it is falling back toward 3% as stocks plunged. $DJIA $SPY Thanksgiving blues.
622 2018-11-20 20:22:06 Is your portfolio trend diversified? Or do you still look at it like a stocks versus bonds thing?
623 2018-11-20 20:21:59 The Dow only momentarily crossed the -600 threshhold before improving a little, going from off 2.4% back to 2.2% in the red.  The Russell 200 down exactly 2%. #markets #stocks #economy @anthonymace
624 2018-11-20 20:21:54 Well Democrats did it got stocks to drop another 600
625 2018-11-20 20:21:34 He's a reckless charlatan. His only "service" to his clients is to encourage them to gamble ever more on increasingly overvalued stocks. He's going to be the cause of a lot of pain to those poor souls who were foolish enough to think he was an expert on anything.
626 2018-11-20 20:21:05 I can see bump stocks going away. But the argument of whether I have a 50 rd mag or 5 10 rd mags make no sense to me.
627 2018-11-20 20:21:02 Stocks taking a dive today and here I am benefiting from my sandwich heavy portfolio.
628 2018-11-20 20:21:00 I'm curious about the beloved FANG stocks. A guy on CNBC said they were a no brainer, all going to a trillion dollar market cap. LOL
629 2018-11-20 20:20:48 @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @chuckschumer @CNNBusiness @foxandfriends @FoxBusiness Stocks are in major correction because Democrats are headed for control of US House. Democrats anti business philosophy is set to wreck the US economy. #DemsAreAntiAmericanBusiness

631 2018-11-20 20:20:33 U.S. stocks sold off across the board on Tuesday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling over 500 points.
632 2018-11-20 20:20:32 Thank you Mr. T for the destruction of the stock market.
Because of this trade war with China and all the other wonderful decisions you made with your wealthy friends in mind, our stocks, those of the little people, are tanking more and more every day.
633 2018-11-20 20:20:07 Let's see, there are a number of "zombies" now that follow USDA's ending stocks guesses, so a Zombie Apocalypse may not look that much different than what we have today. Death Star vaporizing Alderaan is what I had in mind.

643 2018-11-20 20:16:42 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your insomnia
644 2018-11-20 20:16:36 Thanksgiving 2016: tell everyone about tech stocks. 

2017: tell everyone about crypto. 

2018: tell everyone about tax lost harvesting.
645 2018-11-20 20:16:27 Tech company stocks are taking a bath. Huge drop and Dow Jones down 600 pts....... get your rain boots ready to weather the storm
646 2018-11-20 20:16:18 Another bloodbath for US tech stocks.

The positive thing is rents are going to collapse.

648 2018-11-20 20:16:03 Of course the variable of how it was supposed to end. Plague or asteroid. Can’t rule out zombies to follow. I’d love to hear your thoughts on how that would reflect ending stocks especially after the zombies.
649 2018-11-20 20:15:55 Conventional wisdom holds if rates climb too rapidly it could create a headwind for equities because rising rates mean increased borrowing costs for corporations and richer yields can also undercut demand for stocks compared against the perception of bonds as risk free assets.

@bgtennisnation
652 2018-11-20 20:14:47 There should be better background checks, mental health checks, revoked privileges for domestic violence and other offenses, no bump stocks, smaller magazines, etc. None of those things takes away our rights to own guns. They just make things a little safer for everyone.
653 2018-11-20 20:14:30 Stocks are in Donald’s toilet! He Wrecked the economy. Tariffs and inability to make a deal with China is destroying this stock market.
654 2018-11-20 20:14:14 @ZevFima do you think margin trading in a market like this makes sense? I suppose if you firmly believe “buying the dip” will pay off then yes, but obviously there’s risk involved. I’d love to nibble on some of the stocks outlined in the bulletin, but am short cash at the moment
655 2018-11-20 20:14:06 Look back at what I said where did I say cash? Nas has stocks and ownerships in companies that are high valued. Those assets are high  liquidity assets so he can get that money whenever he wants
656 2018-11-20 20:14:00 Life is hard and people are stingy and/or broke online it’s why we are here and not trading stocks or some shiZ

658 2018-11-20 20:13:28 Needs to close 4640 ish then some sort of stop rebound likely I reckon as everybody exits stocks because the Dow probably crashes hard next session. #joy

659 2018-11-20 20:13:25 The reason stocks are falling is because interest rates have risen in the US though they are forecasted to ease #asx #Dow

686 2018-11-20 20:04:42 Yeah, that is why the Dow and stocks are sinking, sinking  in the sunset day after day now. The stock market leads the economy and it is our future.

689 2018-11-20 20:04:14 Hey, Ed. Don’t disagree. But sensible laws - background checks, bump stocks, et al. - are not unreasonable. The radical scare tactics (NO ONE will take away our guns, that’s pot stirring rhetoric) aren’t necessary. Have a nice day!
690 2018-11-20 20:04:10 If you invest, remember that it is a market of stocks, not a "Stock Market." Also, until banks are the only institutions who can hold gold and silver for clients, & futures require actual possession for sale, commodity prices will remain at the whim of very large pools of money.

712 2018-11-20 19:59:57 Actually it’s cus tech stocks.
713 2018-11-20 19:59:17 Yes, and that's why the stock market has been tanking and the Dow has lost all its gains for the year while tech stocks are down 20% or more off their 52-week highs. 

That is some real good moves on Trump's part. Thanks for playing & revealing the paucity of your intelligence.

723 2018-11-20 19:54:11 This doesn't mean altcoin/STO/neo-derivatives markets can't eclipse Bitcoin in terms of market cap. But they'll be doing so in a somewhat orderly fashion, similar to how stocks/bonds/derivatives markets became worth much more than gold. Gold still a thing n so'll Bitcoin remain.
724 2018-11-20 19:54:03 meh I’m excited for a stock market collapse, because that means I can buy stocks cheap as hell and just sit on em for a decade or more as they grow.

729 2018-11-20 19:51:32 Crap, I didn’t read that right. I’m, uh, not quite sure of which specific sector. Usually, they generalize the rising and falling of stocks. Sorry again.
730 2018-11-20 19:51:26 Believe that was answered the day after election when stocks closed with a big gain.
731 2018-11-20 19:50:54 The stock market has been artificially inflated by all those stock buybacks using the profits they brought back tax free. Nobody has a clue what the real value of stocks are.

740 2018-11-20 19:48:54 fuzzypanda told the truth, #SSTI #ShotSpotter has never done something but only hype around their stocks and device which will spy on u bc it can recognize monologs. we do not need it, @Snowdenwill not love u Ralph 
741 2018-11-20 19:48:30 When more institutions unload $APPL they will one by one downgrade until this is -30% like every other tech stocks
742 2018-11-20 19:48:20 Tech stocks have declined to pre 2018 gains.  Hopefully a resurrected coal industry rejuvenates the economy.  Coal is the future!!!
743 2018-11-20 19:48:05 @realDonaldTrump WOW stocks dropping like a turd out of a tall cows ass.
Time for you to #RESIGN 
Before Mueller puts you in prison.
744 2018-11-20 19:48:01 $rost stocks for less
745 2018-11-20 19:47:56 Well Stocks Down being ain’t nothing compared to Crypto Carnage!
746 2018-11-20 19:47:01 Look at how Jim Cramer changed the tune on stocks. All along he was like market can higher and people should buy it.. now he has 10 reasons why market won’t go higher..
747 2018-11-20 19:46:34 Everyone thinks the sky is falling. But god dam there appears to be some cheap venture and cse stocks out there......
748 2018-11-20 19:46:24 Meaning somebody comes in and stocks the shelves themselves like coke, pepsi & snack companies at corner convenience stores?  I could see them missing it, if so.
749 2018-11-20 19:46:01 I have a feeling most Trump supporters have zero investments in stocks. They prob keep the extra $5 they have in mason jars
750 2018-11-20 19:45:49 Death Crosses everywhere, and people want to buy stocks? 
751 2018-11-20 19:45:42 Am I the only who feels like treasuries are in no way interested in upside right now? No matter what stocks or the USD does. I’d want to sell here but as soon as I do that, straight up. I’ll let everyone know when I do that so you can buy.
752 2018-11-20 19:45:38 Also expect more downgrades as institutions reduce risk on tech like $APPL and roll into safe haven stocks.
753 2018-11-20 19:45:27 I'm glad I sold all my stocks yesterday
754 2018-11-20 19:45:15 time for buying AC Stocks- Voltas? Blue star?
755 2018-11-20 19:45:14 Back from 2 days in the Cotswolds but wasn’t expecting this incredible rout in oil . My few longs in the sector luckily not a big size are  in percentage terms taking a big beating #brent #stocks #uk #markets
756 2018-11-20 19:44:52 Stocks: ending of the free money for the buy backs close, so here is the downturn
Bonds: interest rates on the rise (or at least not falling) due to Fed pushed by inflation.
Cryptos: The buble of the false "safeheaven" bursting.

758 2018-11-20 19:44:13 I always forget about stocks and stuff. Always interests me. I suck at math, but I LOVE charts. Used to watch morning news every day with my Dad before he went to work. Our local business guy was Jim Newman.

Fashionably late??(about a week)
760 2018-11-20 19:42:35 Retails stocks get crushed even despite hopeful safes. The decrease in sales have lots of potential to continue in the future.#SUACCF18
761 2018-11-20 19:41:39 He took away our stocks and our bonuses he won't help out his homeless employee who literally go days without eating. But yet he can donate $97 million to charity that he can write off and get notoriety for
762 2018-11-20 19:41:36 In other words, every cent earned towards retirement in stocks is gone for this entire year.
763 2018-11-20 19:41:25 I wonder when $UEX moves up. It has performed extremely bad compared to many other U stocks the last couple of months..
764 2018-11-20 19:41:05 Stocks juega cuando quiere boludoo,la mitad de las veces camina arrastrando los pies 
765 2018-11-20 19:39:56 Yeah, part of my problem is I missed the entries in the $90’s which bums me out. I just get jaded when other “tech” stocks, even the older ones like $MSFT can get a 23 multiple while $AAPL ‘s is at 12!
766 2018-11-20 19:39:55 It’s definitely strange that the CEO of MGM sold his stocks in his own company right before the #shooting in #LasVegas then buys them back afterwards for very cheap. #InsiderTrading
767 2018-11-20 19:39:51 I think U stocks will bleed a bit more together with the rest of the market..
768 2018-11-20 19:39:49 market round trip ,,,declining again,,, wonder which is worse ,,hacking thru o'hare airport  to pick up  relatives today  or ,ndx starting to look like the march 2000 break down ,,,and subsequent bear market ,,,amzn, googl bright stocks
769 2018-11-20 19:39:23 Fools, this is historically the time of year that there is a sell off off stocks to cover cost of holiday season . Look back at history 60-70 years stop being chicken little. Smart money is buying .
770 2018-11-20 19:38:55 It was easy to see long ago that #stocks were a bubble.
How long could stocks soar - when the visible economy looks like one nil-wage fast food joint after another, when 43% of recent college grads are underemployed?
771 2018-11-20 19:38:30 Someone better at math than me should calculate what a single year of 0% returns on stocks and bonds does to a pension fund.
772 2018-11-20 19:38:09 The Steelers kept that TO Sunday until they absolutely needed it.Back in the good old days of Wall St analyst who swung stocks around with ratings changes were referred to as the Ax on a stock or a sector

777 2018-11-20 19:36:02 When will stocks trade much higher, so it will again be safe to buy them?
778 2018-11-20 19:35:53 Dow drops more than 500 points. Stocks have erased gains for 2018
779 2018-11-20 19:35:45 $CANN.c $HERTF Only green Cannabis stock on my watchlist  Also represents 90% of my holdings in that sector #potstocks #cannabis #stocks #investing
780 2018-11-20 19:35:32 The S&amp;P 500 hit a three-week low on Tuesday as weak results and forecasts from a bunch of retailers including Target and Kohl's fanned worries about holiday season sales, while tech stocks continued to slide on concerns about iPhone sales.
781 2018-11-20 19:35:26 Always like to hear about corporate buybacks when markets are falling....but corporations had record buybacks in Q3 ($200B), when stocks near/at record levels. Their timing hasn’t been the best #buybacks $AAPL bought more than $60B in first three quarters of 2018
782 2018-11-20 19:35:22 Stocks are down but also I don't understand economics
783 2018-11-20 19:35:12 People are under employed and 90% of us don't own any stocks. There's like a whole bunch of people with very different circumstances. It's not our ignorance that is the problem.
784 2018-11-20 19:35:04 Good job my man!
785 2018-11-20 19:34:44 7-yr performance, Bitcoin is still outperforming stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate - and every (non-crypto) money manager in the world.
786 2018-11-20 19:34:16 @TheCryptoMonk which platform / exchange do you recommend for trading stocks? Thanks!
787 2018-11-20 19:34:14 Who's maxing out their capital losses this year?  #stocks #Crypto
788 2018-11-20 19:34:04 There’s just a link to the offer from the email. It reads ‘We’ve also added a £5 coupon to your account to spend on a Waitrose medium turkey, we’ll deduct the £5 at check out, all you have to do is shop as normal – but hurry, the offer’s only valid while stocks last.’
789 2018-11-20 19:34:02 Chris you've been taken to school my friend. You know nothing about stocks. Keep fishing
790 2018-11-20 19:33:49 You know, if it was possible, I would just love to driving the number 48 at our Highway 92 Raceway Park. Their rules package for the super stocks class says no Camaros, so I thought, why don't you just use the 2016 Chase car, winning Johnson his 7th championship! #48Forever
791 2018-11-20 19:33:16 Tech stocks remain under pressure after yesterday's tech-driven sell-off; FAANGs volatile

792 2018-11-20 19:33:11 @realDonaldTrump STOCKS PLUMMET: Stocks have dropped over 900 points in the past two  days. This week Pres. Trump gave himself an ‘A+’ on his handling of the  economy in a Fox News exclusive interview, adding ‘Can I go higher than  that?’
793 2018-11-20 19:33:00 Now paints and industrial,  chemical stocks will fly... #crude is getting weaker and weaker..
794 2018-11-20 19:32:58 @realDonaldTrump not talking about how good stocks are today?
795 2018-11-20 19:32:55 @realDonaldTrump 
45.
How is the stock market going?
Better question is, how are your stocks and your families stock doing?
796 2018-11-20 19:31:49 US stocks: Please don't be dismayed by a falling stock market - we're the fuckers who started the trade war, after all.    What's good for the goose is good for the gander...
797 2018-11-20 19:31:49 Might give it a try!   Like my real ales but our bar only stocks common stuff.
798 2018-11-20 19:31:42 does anyone know if rake stocks have soared since Trump endorsed them for wildfire prevention?
799 2018-11-20 19:31:23 We're at the point right now where if amazon/google/apple have a bad day; everyone has a bad day.  Also many larger sell offs are in the tech stocks.  the politics of them and the increasing chance of Sherman Act enforcement has the institutions a little skittish
800 2018-11-20 19:31:17 It wasn't always that way. Spend enough time in Silicon Valley, like I have, and it's littered with men and women in their early 50's and 60's who gave up their companies to a bigger fish- and were swallowed up with it. They got big pay days. They earned massive stocks- a job
801 2018-11-20 19:31:10 Are you sure???? I doubt the POTUS would lie to us. I also bet he invested in Lowes and Home and is watching the stocks getting ready to soar with all the rake sales that are coming... it's on my Xmas/Hanukkah list!

817 2018-11-20 19:27:28 I think Rewe stocks them. Problem is, if I buy them I'll have to eat them.
818 2018-11-20 19:27:25 People will want tech stocks again. When they're higher.
819 2018-11-20 19:25:44 Thank you. Owning any stocks brutal right now.
820 2018-11-20 19:25:37 Securities laws generally only apply to instruments like stocks that are publicly traded on exchange markets. Real estate is illiquid and carries many other risks so the potential for abuse like this is lessened. And "insider trading" would be difficult to enforce here.

825 2018-11-20 19:24:47 Goldman and BAML both say cash is competitive relative to stocks. That’s bearish for stock buybacks.
826 2018-11-20 19:24:27 I assume no recession short term. Bc everybody expect it, stocks are not overvalued, America is doing better than reported. The China trade war could hit the market short term, but after a dip people will see the positives again. Could be completely wrong. 
827 2018-11-20 19:24:07 c'est pas une simple question de changement..

835 2018-11-20 19:21:08 Wow, in my short time studying stocks and the market I would have told you that I viewed apple as just about the safest stock of them all and a very safe bet going long. I guess even apple can fall huge. Didn’t see this coming.
836 2018-11-20 19:20:12 I’m glad we sold our stocks and stopped contributing to our 401K. We shall wait for better times.
837 2018-11-20 19:19:47 I'm going to need to see a Verrit code on those facts.

839 2018-11-20 19:18:09 you brought vanguard into the debate...what was that other than a mention of the stock market? You said they manage your retirement, in stocks. I don't understand your argument if that was not an intro the stock market.
840 2018-11-20 19:18:07 With all this talk about individual stocks being in a "Bear Market", the actual market $SPX is only in a 10% correction   LOL

850 2018-11-20 19:13:03 I believe a lot of stocks crashing numbers has also to do with trump.
Americans believe he is bringing us to a bad place economically, international and wall st. and holders are responding.
851 2018-11-20 19:12:57 DOW down YTD even though Corp's have spent billions buying back their stocks (driving their stock prices higher).  Working stiff R's who continue to believe they were going to benefit from tax reform might want to rethink that......but, for some reason, they continue to be duped.
852 2018-11-20 19:12:44 Remember, Stocks don't go straight up or straight 
down. There will be corrections at all-time highs.  It's healthy.  The 
U.S. economy is still strong with Consumer Confidence at all-time 
highs.

90%+ of 1.0 is  this year.
90%+ of tech stocks are  this year.

872 2018-11-20 19:09:46 Stocks down. Facebook down. They all fall down.
873 2018-11-20 19:08:40 on the other hand, stocks are more risky, and you can get higher returns if the company is profitable, including dividends and  stock buybacks, but the risk is if the company goes bankrupt, ya money gone. So basically, diversification can help in SOME cases.
874 2018-11-20 19:08:27 Lol stocks are down because stocks are down unless of course they’re not
875 2018-11-20 19:08:12 It is very funny, really. You conpare 2016 year when was the largest stocks in history. And yes in 2017 they were less but also big.
876 2018-11-20 19:08:08 Yes folks, stocks are tanking.

But by all means, think twice before you panic and sell now in an attempt to ‘cut your losses’.

It’s pure agony to sit by on the sidelines with heavy losses as the markets inevitably come roaring back.
877 2018-11-20 19:07:37 if you wanted to ramp the market, which stocks would influence it the most right now

879 2018-11-20 19:06:59 Hey @ViciousTrading. You might enjoy this one from @duediligenceguy. Relates to question of buying hot stocks after a period of consolidation.  Point being that there's usually some collapse before the consolidation happens and things get cheap enough again...
880 2018-11-20 19:06:32 You and your stocks bro lnao
881 2018-11-20 19:06:25 diversification is all about minimizing risks. you can touch of points of how bonds are generally less risky than stocks but can generate potential higher returns. bonds have fixed amounts of interest and principle. so if a company goes bankrupt you still can be paid.
882 2018-11-20 19:06:21 $AMD I think if we can take out $19, this will come down.

883 2018-11-20 19:06:08 Since stocks are now down for the year when can we expect DT to take responsibility? I mean he took credit when they were up, he should now explain himself and say what he’s going to do to fix it.
884 2018-11-20 19:06:05 Like it but I'm staying away from resource stocks for the moment.
885 2018-11-20 19:06:03 Great idea! @Steenbergs (a great local independent business) stocks a suitable "spekuloos" spice blend, for an authentic, northern European flavour.
886 2018-11-20 19:05:51 “I reiterate my market view that T10yr will not breach 3.5% this cycle; but let me offer the strong caveat that if I am incorrect, all h@ll will break loose as the correlation between Stocks and Bonds will flip positive and they will both go "power-windows down" -Harley Bassman
887 2018-11-20 19:05:46 Before a person trades stocks learn to trade commodity markets
888 2018-11-20 19:05:46 Correct.. largest nominal. but in relation to a product that has 9% larger stocks over last year which were 9% over the prior year and being a JIT product, its hugely oversupplied and marginal values of that oversupply are valuing the whole complex. Only way out is cutting prod.

893 2018-11-20 19:05:01 Trumps economy is beginning to unravel. The stock market is heading into a tailspin. Stocks are falling. Trumps treating our Country like his failed Casinos. This time, we all will be bankrupted and his MAGA dreams a disaster. The National Debt will destroy all of us !

895 2018-11-20 19:04:22 Still can’t understand why no one stocks the bitter aperitifs like San Bitters and Crodino. Massive market for  Aperol Spritz, but it’s practically impossible to get the alcohol free version.
896 2018-11-20 19:03:57 @cvpayne Markets are going down 25-40% before there will be a major turnaround. However certain stocks have probably already bottomed. Individuals stocks bottom long before the general markets

898 2018-11-20 19:03:50 Yep. Glad I switched to a more conservative plan a couple of weeks ago. Went from 70% stocks to 30%. I still feel it, but don't have to worry about getting completely wiped out by tariffs.
899 2018-11-20 19:03:42 These 5 Tech Stocks Combined Have Lost More Than $800 Billion in Market Value
900 2018-11-20 19:02:20 I'm sorry but this #market is way oversold. Especially some of the #tech #stocks. My advice. Look for bargains
901 2018-11-20 19:02:04 WH message has been confusing & unlikely deal-US market can’t find floor & buy low / sell high is risky strategy as there is no floor. Clearly this is notable in this correction-the most valuable company stock is in bear market along with other quality growth stocks($1Twipe out)
902 2018-11-20 19:01:54 And last winter was large stocks. It is normal for gas to spike from time to time

Sarah, you dolt, the election is over.
She is trying to help America. 
What are you doing? Anything oh I dunno, POSITIVE!?
Nice tweet ratio
904 2018-11-20 19:01:10 You are cherry picking data to make your point. My tweet is accurate in that the economy is great. Watch any channel that follows the markets and the experts all say the same thing. The current down trend is due to tech stocks being in the red due to poor management.
905 2018-11-20 19:01:07 Yea, my 401K is negative right now, and my actual stocks are getting fucked up
906 2018-11-20 19:01:06 Ya the stock market will react to a split power...I mean seriously would you put your money in stocks knowing all the democrats are going to do is hinder progress? They already said they will open 83 investigations instead of doing their job
907 2018-11-20 19:01:02 I honestly thought about investing in marijuana stocks.

910 2018-11-20 19:00:30 That is my understanding about these numbers, yes. Then USDA estimates that China's soybean reserves are about 6-8 mmt (I assume those are not port stocks?). Taking these two together at China's assumed consumption rate for this year would yield about 8 weeks of supply.
911 2018-11-20 19:00:25 The current bull market rally started March 9, 2009 and became the longest one on record since World War II. 

With recent declines, more than 40% of stocks are now in bear market territory.

Let's hear more about Trump's great economy.
912 2018-11-20 19:00:11 Some people are asking "what is gun control".  Well we can start by outlawing bump stocks which turn a semi-automatic into an actual fully-automated machine gun.  We can start by outlawing all semi-automatic weapons.  We can start by requiring background checks at gun shows.
913 2018-11-20 19:00:08 we are expected to believe that china built up thier soybean stocks on prices much higher than today and are happy with it,   get real
914 2018-11-20 18:59:45 i always like to point out that we investors need to check earnings dates before buying new stocks but this quarter has been something else - so much earnings announcement carnage!
915 2018-11-20 18:59:41 pretend? You realise stocks have been down for the company this last period because you’ve been playing black ops 4 rather than working...  call hr do determine what your future with company will look like thanks
916 2018-11-20 18:59:10 Trump your Voodoo Economics is falling apart. Stocks today down over 450 points wiping out all the gains this year in one day. WOW. Farmers are going bankrupt. Interest rates rising. A new 25% tax on products Americans buy. A deficit going up the fastest ever in history.
917 2018-11-20 18:58:29 Remember when you jizzing all over yourself because of the Stock Market? Why aren't you addressing how it's lost all of it"s 2018 gains? #Trump #POTUS #potus #stocks #TuesdayThoughts #TuesdayMotivation #dumptrump #Resist #BREAKING #StockMarket

920 2018-11-20 18:57:16 I have a feeling we are in for a Black Friday in the markets with stocks on sale up to 70% off there highs #blackfriday
921 2018-11-20 18:57:09 If you'd said Donald instead of Fred, I would have caught it ! But I bet Mr. Trump has never owned a stock. Why would he if he can launder Russian money. That's even more lucrative than stocks ... and turns a much quicker profit !

925 2018-11-20 18:56:26 You are just parroting what Trump says. Obama was handed a mess from Bush. Obama handed Trump a already growing economy, Obama Judges were blocked, our trade relationship is not good this why stocks are plummeting, cutting taxes for the rich put our national debt thru the roof
926 2018-11-20 18:56:04 Do you think Trump knows that if the US pisses off the Saudis, they will stomp on the economy (stocks and bonds)?
927 2018-11-20 18:55:53 Stocks are plummeting.  The day of reckoning is near.
928 2018-11-20 18:55:34 No bought other stocks instead and took profits on it sadly.
929 2018-11-20 18:55:23 If you had this kind of information and moved on it with publicly traded stocks, you would be going to jail. #ethics
930 2018-11-20 18:54:58 Right. So a high inflation, high interest rate environment. 

Stands to sense that stocks would be priced to generate a relatively high dividend.

Are we heading that way again? I wouldn’t bet that Helicopter Ben was wrong. Wouldn’t bet the ranch he was right mind you.
931 2018-11-20 18:54:46 You make the markets to dificult for yourself. Stupid people can make money on  stocks. Just find the hype and sell in time! I am not down this year. But I sold Altai at 15.5$ when your wrote «what idiot sells Altai at these levels»

936 2018-11-20 18:52:13 You are the one with the agenda, #CheetoconTweeto is sending into an economic tailspin, stocks down 2000 pts negative gain for the year, almost a trillion dollar deficit spending, 220m on troop movement to stop 3k asylum seekers, unconstitutional (ruled by his own app judge) EO
937 2018-11-20 18:52:07 Bond bulls were all excited this morning. Nasty taunts in my mentions.

Now dead quiet as stocks down 500 and $tlt going nowhere.
938 2018-11-20 18:51:22 Ouch, to be short one of the few things moving up nicely. That's why I don't usually short individual stocks in a correction. Long volatility works better.
939 2018-11-20 18:51:18 You’re mother bought stocks just so something would go down on her.

943 2018-11-20 18:50:27 Markets should be considered long-term investments. If you have the funds to spare for 10 to 20 years and you can just forget about them, the markets are a very safe investment. This can be handled by a reputable broker or you invest in blue chip quality stocks. No day trading!

989 2018-11-20 18:36:11 Could not agree. Low Stocks = High Volatility. Last winter was warm, but even last year there was spike in price. So when stocks lower than in 2005 plus consumption growth plus pace of consumption > pace of supply. Cold can freeze pipelenes and it always happen in past.

If he wants to liquidate he can liquidate

Supply and demand

Just highlights the pathetic idea of SOV

Velocity matters

1002 2018-11-20 18:32:47 A poem should be onstage and unforeseen
As a retaliatory hierarchy,

Versed
As arrested breakers to the theater,

Engrossing as the jealous stocks
Of vaulting mentalities where the repository has zoomed--

A poem should be answerable
As the aviation of treadmills.
1003 2018-11-20 18:32:32 I agree. But you know, the country runs on Amazin, Netflix , Google and Facebook. Those stocks need to recover first
1004 2018-11-20 18:32:12 They are  moving out of Tech stocks to energy stocks...
1005 2018-11-20 18:32:05 demo ? That was in 2016 na ? N how will it trigger global run. Ye stocks are more rational In a way as they run on some intrinsic merit.@here if Btc is being kept down then everything has to be down irrespective of potential , Fundamentals or real world use coz of pairing
1006 2018-11-20 18:32:02 LMAO I think there is a decent chance that the buyer is actually that guy...Oil down -7%, stocks down -2%, and USDJPY is up...Big miscorrelations on big days cost serious mental capital.
1007 2018-11-20 18:31:02 Lol not yet...soon tho...and my crypto ETF is not in the same account as my weed stocks, are you crazy??

1010 2018-11-20 18:30:37 It's slowing and sliding. Stocks are falling. The sugar candy injection of coorporate tax breaks is over and the damage he's doing with trade is sad.
1011 2018-11-20 18:30:24 Reminder: 

Trumpism 101: stocks go up due to Trump.
They go down due to Democrats.
1012 2018-11-20 18:30:21 What about bullets and bump stocks? Still free or discounted at the Company Store?  Screw these ridiculous people.
1013 2018-11-20 18:30:10 Especially Tech stocks
1014 2018-11-20 18:30:00 Stocks grow concerned over trade issues and what will the #Fed do next.
1015 2018-11-20 18:29:26 1/2 Per the norm Trump is using scare tactics to cover for his abysmal stewarding of our economy. Tech stocks are dragging due to luke warm performance of Apples new products. Additionally the disruption in US / Chinese trade relations is driving the entire tech sections down.
1016 2018-11-20 18:28:47 “Record markets” tells me you don’t own any stocks. The Dow is down for 2018 at this point.
1017 2018-11-20 18:28:45 Step to the Meat and Poultry at the local supermarket, listening to the intro to 'Murder was the Case', I find the right bird as I'm singing:

1021 2018-11-20 18:27:54 guys i feel like a real adult. i just sold and traded stock all on my own. and i still have more stocks vesting for the future
1022 2018-11-20 18:27:37 dont tell my gram im investing in pot stocks
1023 2018-11-20 18:27:22 ca dépend des objets surtout mais il devrait y avoir assez de stocks pour tous
1024 2018-11-20 18:27:20  Charts are still ugly and con not reverse course without erasing most or all today’s losses. Markets need a sharp up reversal to or around the green territories; otherwise, be prepared for another leg down .

1025 2018-11-20 18:27:07 It's a fair point, pushing the krill fishery offshore, away from penguin colonies is part of the management. The very predictable stocks are favoured by fishing boats but leads to overlap in demand. Anecdotally, the area often has large numbers of Fin, Humpback and Minke Whales.

1029 2018-11-20 18:26:53 President Trump warned what would happen if you elected Dems, and once again, he was right. It explains why stocks are tanking since Dems rigged their elections to retake the House. More Dem corruption without criminal arrests. After 2 years Hillary still hasn't been arrested!

1050 2018-11-20 18:21:42 Stocks tumbling - again - with 2018 gains erased. Trump admits murder of civilians okay tool for foreign governments so long as he keeps getting paid - and still referring to press as “enemy of the people” in all its Stalinesque glory. What exactly is great??? #MAGA #Resist
1051 2018-11-20 18:21:30 Not a right time to enter the stocks
1052 2018-11-20 18:21:15 Many of our "public servants " own stock in companies like Smith & Wesson.  Everytime they threaten new gun laws, their stocks skyrocket and they make a shit ton of money. Obama is a prime example.

1066 2018-11-20 18:16:59 @Jesse_Livermore Hi Jesse. Have you ever considered looking at stocks that fall off the IBD 100 to see how they perform subsequently?

Idea being you could find potential short candidates in companies that no longer have growth/momo but are too expensive for value.
1067 2018-11-20 18:16:38 How are your stocks doing!
1068 2018-11-20 18:16:22 Too late to be pro-Drumpf...Drumpf should be ashamed of himself and no it isnt national security it his investments in military stocks and money laundromat banks in Saudi Arabia is his concern.
1069 2018-11-20 18:16:08 The stock market is 100% controlled by algo software now, it’s not a free trading market based on trades, they can make stocks go up or down with software, remember the flash crash, that is when they were implementing software to control the market.

1088 2018-11-20 18:10:23 Nobody said anything about not criticising twitter, but it's ironic to do so and also promote hashtags. Twitter's stock has come down, so has google's, facebook's, microsoft's. The world does not revolve around you. Stocks fluctuate due to numerous other reasons.

1091 2018-11-20 18:09:43 1. Why do #crypto "investors" not get it? $BCH split is not why crypto markets are crashing. Manipulation is not tanking the markets. Fed tightening (#QT), trade war fears, fear of recession are tanking the markets. Housing is down, stocks are down, gold is down, oil is down.

1095 2018-11-20 18:08:44 And I’m a Brexiteer myself . Believe in this country but some people are not thinking straight. I know why Rees mogg etc want no deal is because currency will drop to rock bottom and they make millions instantly in stocks

1097 2018-11-20 18:08:07 Ya sure that was a side show that was not there main anchors or commentators saying it on air live. When have they tweeted about the market highs there. They on live air they only talk about negative stocks going down show me them saying stocks record high or tweet
1098 2018-11-20 18:08:02 I think it's funny that "tariffs" are the first thing conservatives blame for ... tech stocks dropping.
1099 2018-11-20 18:07:49 And I will add bump stocks to the conversation. Did you know they were originally designed to assist  physically disabled individuals with fine motor skills issues?  They should require a doctor exam just like a handicap parking permit.
1100 2018-11-20 18:07:31 STOCKS down again so tell US,you Businesses don’t care about US but yourself. I think America can  this pucture very clear . Demarcates still is trying to control the Dow Jones since Democrats won the House . People will have a Choice A Better Happier Life for your Future?!

1115 2018-11-20 18:02:23 Why are crypto people oblivious to the macro picture. The Fed is tightening. Housing is down, stocks are down, why would the most speculative asset be exempt from the laws of supply and demand. That is, less supply of money (QT) means less demand for assets.

1132 2018-11-20 17:59:18 In fact some of that transfer of wealth happened much earlier, when some people bought way overpriced stocks from other people.  The "crash" only exposed the losses of the former.
1133 2018-11-20 17:59:11 I want to start a fund that uses different small mammals to pick investments.  Squirrels short tech stocks, but plow a lot of assets into acorn acquisition

1137 2018-11-20 17:57:48 “Growth” stocks like $AMZN, $NFLX, and $NVDA worked great for years, is the “easy money” there over? Are we going to have to be happy with 5% gains a year now? Just thinking out loud.
1138 2018-11-20 17:57:36 US stock markets have continued to fall today, wiping out all the gains made during Q1-Q3, as technology stocks slid again amid fears of a trade war with China, which has worried investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost more than 560 points by mid-morning, 1/3

1153 2018-11-20 17:51:59 Your stocks have a lot of letters. Maybe you should buy some single letter stocks to bring the average closer to benchmark.
1154 2018-11-20 17:51:17 I’m not on my computer right now but I scaled up with small shares close to the top to short it on those stocks. Long trade was washout long

1161 2018-11-20 17:50:01 Always look at which stocks are trading in big volumes: either versus recent average volume or versus % market cap.

Some names for today's market capitalization:

$AMD 8.08%
$TSRO 6.14%
$SQ 5.90%
$NVDA 5.44%
$ROKU 4.51%
$ANF 4.21%
$TWLO 3.94%
$LB 3.73%
$JCP 3.35%
$TSLA 3.03%
1162 2018-11-20 17:49:55 Because innocent until proven guilty. Tether is trash, but it has pioneered tokenized dollars. Bitfinex is trash too, but it has provided the market with margins - an expected instrument in stocks - while the regulated ones still have no margins, let alone options.
1163 2018-11-20 17:49:24 Advertising to sell stocks?! What the 2018 is going on here?
1164 2018-11-20 17:49:22 Agree, that would be interesting! Also, I wouldn't say harmless, only that there's no reason to believe inflation necessarily dooms stocks.
1165 2018-11-20 17:49:15 What that messages tells us it that you would have to wait till money has reflected though, as well as depending with availability of foreign currency. I truly pray that the pharmacies don’t run dry because they do not age the forex required to replenish their stocks.

1170 2018-11-20 17:48:44 Wow. So, why then is it always at the top of the news when stocks plummet, or climb precipitously, I wonder? And further, why should the 94% of Americans care?
1171 2018-11-20 17:47:36 @rushlimbaugh said forces at will could tank the markets if they think it hurts @realDonaldTrump. An anti trust suit could change their minds? Ha.

1188 2018-11-20 17:41:15 Don't confuse a drop in the stock market with a recession.
 Macroeconomic drivers are what's fundamental to economic growth.

Whether tech stocks can keep their market cap stable is not.

One significantly effects the average American family.

The other does not.

1193 2018-11-20 17:39:37 The dollar is up today because people think it's safer to buy the dollar than to buy stocks. At the same time the 10Y yield is down and stocks are in bear market so no reason to buy the dollar. The truth is, like stocks the dollar is probably in a bear market $DXY

1196 2018-11-20 17:39:16 I get a good laugh when certain traders spew their “expertise” that particular stocks will continue falling another 20-30% or more, yet lack the conviction to actually short these stock(s)!
1197 2018-11-20 17:39:13 Ledge snapping, trumping, etc. I guess edgeguarding/off-stage gameplay would be a better reason. Recovery just seemed way too free, stocks were more decided on landing one big blow instead of combo-ing the enemy off stage and then playing a mixup flowchart game offstage

1217 2018-11-20 17:32:33 I'd personally expect more like a 5% real arithmetic average for stocks. Divs (maybe adjusting for buybacks) plus growth doesn't appear to me to offer more than 5%, and with CAPE at double long-term avg, I don't see further PE expansion -- more likely the reverse.

1228 2018-11-20 17:29:37 Good. Who cares? No regular people invest in stocks anyway, it's only the 1% who really move the money around, anyway. I hope it hurts when they lose a few million, but I doubt it will make a difference.
1229 2018-11-20 17:29:27 Maybe... But I have a feeling many don't want to hold stocks in a market like this. None of the issues are fixed, and it can get worse. More selloff can come

1256 2018-11-20 17:21:23 Apparently massive federal debt and declining stocks.
1257 2018-11-20 17:20:48 Well, u can sell some of the stocks later to get one for free. Did that to all my Apple products like iphone iPad & iWatch.
1258 2018-11-20 17:20:26 Anyone counting on tech stocks to offset losses elsewhere in the market,must stop drinking from The Inkwell.These companies are carbon copies of one another,& most will fall by the wayside.The proven stock is the safe bet,now is not the time to build a room on your house.
1259 2018-11-20 17:20:18 Brazil + drawing on stocks I think
1260 2018-11-20 17:19:26 What I'd do is stay away from social media stocks entirely. They are creating a hostile environment to the one thing that can keep them profitable. As long as they are going to be political censors they will never create ad growth they need especially given how much they waste.
1261 2018-11-20 17:19:21 The market stories were about Oil, Brexit and US Stocks. Now #Crypto stories are adding up. #OnCurrency
1262 2018-11-20 17:19:11 Hate it when I just go and start buying a few things while it’s sideways and hard to tell where it’s going. Some stocks are up but indexes down
1263 2018-11-20 17:19:09 Bounce in AMZN was good but notice large volume down on open compared to low volume on the way up. More weakness ahead. #stocks #markets
1264 2018-11-20 17:19:04 @FoxNews EVERYBODY FEEL NICE& COZY. STOCKS DROPPED TODAY. Stocks; all their Gains for the Whole Year are gone.TRUMP & CHINA DIDNT WORK OUT.Guess Whats happening now. Tariffs are going up to 25%. By the WAY- IVANKA IS NOT KEEPING OUR COUNTRY SAFE.Trump;Is Using his Personal phone
1265 2018-11-20 17:18:38 All will be hit: Pension funds, life insurance funds and lots of jobs lost (in Germany I would expect 3 million).

Winners: People who hold #gold, want to buy properties & have lots of cash for cheap #stocks.

1267 2018-11-20 17:18:31 Most people get interested in stocks when everyone else is. The time to get interested is when no one else is. You can’t buy what is popular and do well. - Warren Buffett
1268 2018-11-20 17:18:25 Too late, only reason is because Wal-Mart is being called out. It's not about her stmt, it's about the mighty dollar.They want their money back, in the meantime, employees are still paid poverty wages while they buy back stocks with the tax break raking in more money. Shameful.
1269 2018-11-20 17:18:18 Not just the algols and HFT, the handcuffing of big cap turkeys to high growth mid caps in $QQQ doesn't allow natural generational turnover in tech stocks to occur as it should. The future gets slaughtered on the altar of the past
1270 2018-11-20 17:18:15 Pentagon stand down prior to 911. Warning sensors were shut down !Trillions in Pentagon money laundering revealed !  Saudi MBS hit teams short US Stocks !  Saudis engage in organized crime & bribery !
1271 2018-11-20 17:18:12 Mexico: Citi cuts target P/E for stocks to 14x and IPC index price targets to 46,200 for mid-2019. Expect higher variability in earnings and lower earnings growth to accompany higher regulatory risk...

1274 2018-11-20 17:17:43 Right now we have a stock Market that is volatile because large Tech stocks that produce little in the real world like Facebook are tanking of their own doing. The economy today has a stronger foundation where real manufacturing and energy are concerned.
1275 2018-11-20 17:17:39 The new game plan... options for income, short term profits and stocks for long term profits #KevinOnWealth

1277 2018-11-20 17:17:33 My grandparents told me to get into reading so I started with my old fiction books like Percy Jackson and Harry Potter and it’s really nice but I get the idea they want me to read books on stocks and mental health

1279 2018-11-20 17:17:22 Capitulation is when I'm on Stocktwits saying to buy them and people respond "why?" and tell me they're doomed and going under and I'm dumb. That's capitulation. Hasn't happened yet in the tech stocks. Other sectors? Yes. But not tech.
1280 2018-11-20 17:17:21 1. Republicans control Congress and Republican elected President.
2. Said Republicans cut taxes for corps. and uber rich.
3. Stocks correct, economy tanks, middle class get shitty end of stick.
4. Democrats take control and fix shit.
5. Rinse and repeat.

1281 2018-11-20 17:17:05 all blue chips broken in a very big way. but still sellable and get out and wait for lower points. some stocks like $fb $nvda are broken companies. capitalism is brutal. price discovery is a every day event and parabolic markets has not helped.
1282 2018-11-20 17:16:53 You would be surprised how many Stocks dip hard before a run. Especially when bashers come out of the wood work and you see pullbacks like this. Nothing guaranteed of course in any stock just my opinion. Best advice always do your own DD. GL
1283 2018-11-20 17:16:50 Even for you Jim and your pollyanna nature, this is shameful speak. Advocating rotation from a real company to a progressively worsening one in a weakening tape as a signal for investing in stocks and the broader market's health? What is going on?
1284 2018-11-20 17:16:50 Stocks Fall, Wiping Out Gains for 2018. Guess @POTUS will blame the fire sale on not raking through the greenbacks! #rakesprogress
1285 2018-11-20 17:16:45 Dear #maga, have you checked your stocks today.  Oh thats right most of you don’t participate in the market, just the leaders that you assign to think on your behalf.

1291 2018-11-20 17:15:15 Clowns. Has nothing to do with Democrats. Stocks are overvalued somewhere between "tremendously and enormously" and it's been suggested that a 10%-15%+ correction is on the horizon. This is how it typically happens. 1/2

1325 2018-11-20 17:08:56 Across the board futures are recovering, so I think, US markets too will close mildly negative to flat regardless of individual stocks like APPL, GOOG and Boeing. And, we will resume our upward march from tomorrow again on Nifty. My 2 cents.
1326 2018-11-20 17:08:34 Thankful the market is finally pulling back. For some buying opportunities in stocks that will be resilient.

1347 2018-11-20 17:03:21 Never ceases to amaze me watching the price action of stocks after the liquidity of the 1 hour dissipates and buyback algos take over. PFE 10 minute bar chart today is a perfect example...I don’t even need to look to know they are doing a buyback.
1348 2018-11-20 17:02:32 Let’s get an update from the uk. @berrimanmartin how’s your milk production and milk price at the moment and how are Feed stocks ?
1349 2018-11-20 17:02:25 We shall see ... both the Fed and DC use that NYSE ticker as its #scoreboard! I doubt either has the stomach for another crash, though there ignorant attempts to pump stocks only ensure it!
1350 2018-11-20 17:02:18 All the FANG stocks are green today......for now.
1351 2018-11-20 17:02:11 In other news, markets are shite atm, tech stocks will continue to fall, oil too. Reviewing next years strategy on the back of the October slump - safe ol' dividend payers may be the way forward

1353 2018-11-20 17:02:04 "A Sea Of Red": Global Stocks Plunge With Tech Shares In Freefall
  there was some nuance in yesterday's pre-open trading, with Asia at least putting up a valiant defense to what would soon become another US rout, this morning the market theme is far simpler: a global sea of red.
1354 2018-11-20 17:01:40 Why not let me decide what is best for the Washington Post. Am not a subscriber, do not own an stocks, common or preferred, so I am not in the least a stake holder, but my opinion is so very important & valid. 

Besides, no that married people ever molest or rape anyone.

1356 2018-11-20 17:01:20 Yea this morning before things turned green.  A lot of fang and other stocks were down 5%.  Some stocks are up 10% from the open.  Seemed like capitulation at the open

1361 2018-11-20 17:00:27 very volatile, especially with rage. 2 stock matches where you can lose stocks at any percent off of one hit. lots of characters are good at camping or need to camp to win. stagelist sucks.
1362 2018-11-20 17:00:25 Stocks grow concerned over trade issues and what will the Fed do next.

1368 2018-11-20 16:59:14 Everything is usually opposite. This year much more so. But there's been some seriously good mj news lately that has not popped the stocks. I think they will soon if we are seeing general market and oil capitulation today.

1371 2018-11-20 16:57:10 Sure. But it strikes me that it would be incredibly intrusive to regulate every possible advantage that such asymmetry would create. There's a strong public policy interest in preventing insider trading on stocks. It's less obvious what that interest is vis-a-via housing.
1372 2018-11-20 16:56:56 If you haven't done so already, if you have a 401K or Roth, it's best to go into the stable fund with your balance as the stock market continues its downward trend but keep buying the stocks at low rates!
1373 2018-11-20 16:56:34 Historically a gridlock congress like we are going to have (and note this has been happening before the elections), has been good for stocks. This is different

1384 2018-11-20 16:53:43 Hey everyone, I just wanted to say that I was able to buy more stocks today and I invested my money with one of my companies that I already had stocks with. And now my shares with them are up 445,000 stocks/shares.

1385 2018-11-20 16:53:34 If I had a nickel for every stock I am one the downside on, well, I'd have a lot of nickels. Thus, when it comes to stocks I tend to play a long game.
1386 2018-11-20 16:52:58 Just to be clear, you're saying that it's a reversal, right?
Actually I used to trade in S&P and Dow when their prices were around 1000 and 15000 respectively.
Given the situation you've described, current prices look hard to sustain. Maybe it's an opportunity to short the stocks
1387 2018-11-20 16:52:24 Today Im down 2% but Im up 60% YTD-not bad at all. Im always hunting for discussions about trends, stocks and economics.  If you're out there hit me up. Let's talk money. @FoxBusiness @themotleyfool @SBenjaminsCast @Investopedia @etrade @Stash
1388 2018-11-20 16:52:05 It's just because all the stocks were going up don't read too far into it.

1392 2018-11-20 16:49:52 Stocks have been dropping then bouncing as idiots continue to try to bftd and then dropping even faster. Classic bear market signal.
1393 2018-11-20 16:49:48 Does anyone really believe that if 'deep-state' had been addressed by now, the enemy-'media' would still be able to promote witch-hunts... or stocks would still have such 'wild' swings.  Those trying to 'kill' AMERICA have swung hard at the 'CONSTITUTION'- America's 'confidence'.
1394 2018-11-20 16:49:46 For sure hyung. But I am out of meme stocks. 
1395 2018-11-20 16:49:28 6 stocks exit tdy, all 20-30% posys plus top sliced 9 of remaining 18 stocks inc some of my top convictions as good but high p/e Co's likely to get hit eventually. Only half down today at time sold. P/F  -1.2% on the day but it would have been over -2% if fully invested. Cash 58%
1396 2018-11-20 16:49:20 very limited stocks na lang ang CDs! 
1397 2018-11-20 16:49:14 At some point the Fed needs to allow the bubble areas of the markets like housing and stocks to deflate. The price distortion over the years in wage vs house price inflation created by unaturally low interest rates should be allowed to correct. Big shame if it doesn't.
1398 2018-11-20 16:48:36 Holiday weeks are best for Left in terms of manipulating stocks- good gig when you can routinely get away with it...
1399 2018-11-20 16:47:47 Il est vrai que nous avons pu profiter de quelques années de baisses massives des prix... malheureusement les stocks des magasins étaient très faibles et certains n'en ont déjà plus !
1400 2018-11-20 16:46:47 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your carpal tunnel syndrome
1401 2018-11-20 16:45:23 Dont bet on it. The trade war is an extinction level event for tech stocks in the stock market.
1402 2018-11-20 16:45:07 Check European stocks and you ll see high quality utilities and telcos at 10-12x pe. But of course you won’t because why would you if Europe gonna blow up

1404 2018-11-20 16:44:21 Housing stocks $XHB getting a bid as traders anticipate lower long rates in the near future to boost affordablility and sales. Housing prices ought to come down. If "affordability" is artificially created by rate cuts rather than price cuts the housing bubble just gets bigger.
1405 2018-11-20 16:44:16 I was in that stock! From under a buck to $3.50 in a day or two, that’s when I first got into stocks

1409 2018-11-20 16:43:12 Do you every talk stocks? Anything you like to own despite your anticipation of an oncoming collapse in prices? I get your internals argument, and of course many stocks trading at high PE of peak margins, supporting your over valuation argument, (cont)
1410 2018-11-20 16:42:55 @jlswls2012 @DebraMessing @slpng_giants  They don't want their stocks to dip...any lower.
1411 2018-11-20 16:42:51 Never understood a bond fund.  Here let me give you a commission for holding a piece of paper??  Nah.  Main reason bond funds exist are that buying bonds is more confusing than stocks.  Wonder where my puts on HYG/JNK are @ now??
1412 2018-11-20 16:42:22 folks you’ve heard of penny stocks, but what if I told you there were tenth-of-a-penny stocks?
1413 2018-11-20 16:41:36 Dont do yourself a favor a look at your stocks today...ouch

1421 2018-11-20 16:39:56 Stocks go up when Republicans are elected. For good reason.
1422 2018-11-20 16:39:55 He is a smart guy and knows cryptocurrency has future. He just wants to beat it down. Of course it's falling, but so do stocks over time.

Speaks volumes.  Are you one of the "John Does" named in the complaint? @Market_Farce @GeoInvesting @AlderLaneeggs
1425 2018-11-20 16:38:34 I know very soon we’ll be kicking ourselves that we didn’t load up more down here. It’s easy when stocks are rallying but the real money is made picking them up when absolutely nothing has changed but we see 30% drops off the back of exaggerated macro movements.
1426 2018-11-20 16:38:31 Investors should be diverse. I own international stocks in my portfolio. I don't want to miss out on the big gains in Mexico and Colombia, as well as Vietnam and Indonesia.
1427 2018-11-20 16:38:23 agreed. but part of the reason global warming is killing us is that western culture emphasized hard science over soft. that emphasis caused traditional economists to fit humans into homo economicus, and fit stocks and flows into the supply/demand curve.
1428 2018-11-20 16:38:07 Advisors love to pretend that they actively buy stocks on sale and sell them for profit. The truth is they are already maxed out their allocations before the correction occurs. 1/
1429 2018-11-20 16:37:44 I guess the Stock Market is coming off the sugar high called Trump, now it’s time for the GOP to wake up like your stocks! Trump is a con loser, lost congress too
1430 2018-11-20 16:37:38 Well, btc started to drop while FAANG/Stocks spiked. Crypto is ahead in terms of pain and capitulation. Perhaps legacy stocks will see much worse in the months ahead while crypto transforms to more bullish sentiment. Interesting times ahead.
1431 2018-11-20 16:37:22 Gold has been making a comeback. Never a good sign for stocks.
1432 2018-11-20 16:37:18 Investors tend to over-analyze when stocks are going down (fear) and under-analyze when stocks are going up (greed).
1433 2018-11-20 16:36:50 I lost a lot of money with these Fang stocks, but what goes up must come down eventually. C'est la vie

1436 2018-11-20 16:36:23 The only "big round numbers" I care about for stocks are 10, 100 & 1000. Even then price history usually dictates if those matter.

1444 2018-11-20 16:34:51 My unsolicited opinion on the stock market.  When the new tax regime was announced, everyone rushed in and stocks got "ahead of their skis."  As growth slowed & tariffs ensued, people rushed in to cash out, also overdone. 2019 will tell.  @thebestcloser #CloserNation

1450 2018-11-20 16:34:00 We should work with mental health reform, strengthen background checks, close the gun show loophole, ban bump stocks, ban high capacity magazines. I don’t believe in banning all guns, that’s ludicrous. I’m not saying all these things will work 100%, but they will help.
1451 2018-11-20 16:33:36 This is how stocks operate: 
Premature reaction to good news ( it's going to be great next year).
Delayed reaction to bad news (Shoot, I need to get out as it dropped 90%)

By the time most stock holders of @facebook  realize it's junk, it already has lost most of its value.

1461 2018-11-20 16:31:29 Why is everyone crying doom and gloom because the stock market is having a sell off?  Me. I see an opportunity for buying stocks at reduced prices.  It’s just Black Friday coming early.
1462 2018-11-20 16:31:26 And people question why social media stocks are diving and user bases are dying.

BUT twitter did something interesting with their ads- they’re letting other companies option their tweets, so that a second company could advertise on/with their tweet. Genius.

1465 2018-11-20 16:30:17 Every investment process must have a loss cutting strategy.  If you invest in indexes it's built in for you, they kick out the underperforming stocks.  If you buy individual stocks you have to implement the loss cutting strategy yourself.  I use #stageanalysis

1475 2018-11-20 16:28:41 Indeed. I love me a good, sentiment driven crash. We've seen a significant drop in the Indian small/midcap space. Though most quality stocks didn't fall as much as my greedy self would wish :)

1482 2018-11-20 16:27:29 Lol you think they aren't laughing stocks. Everyday they are some tweet or report of theirs is ridiculed. Countering them isn't to change the minds of their core audience. It's to prevent them from fooling more ppl and getting more audience.
1483 2018-11-20 16:27:29 High rates bring higher eps due to growth but as well brings lower P/E ratio as compared to earlier when liquidity is in abundance. Higher eps that’s coming in now was already factored in by markets earlier that’s why even on good results stocks are selling off.

1491 2018-11-20 16:25:03 I'm glad I'm not relying completely on my very modest 401k. Thank God I'll have SS and a pension, cuz this economy is getting scarier. I think recession will be sooner than you think. Try to prepare as best you can-move stocks to conservative, cash out small ones, pay the tax.
1492 2018-11-20 16:25:02 There is a lot of bad in the stock market.

1506 2018-11-20 16:21:28 and i'm down another 1.5% today and now 20% for the year, this is becoming a real test of my resolve. Totally irrational, i only hold good stocks but everything is getting battered. 
1507 2018-11-20 16:21:20 As of this morning, all major stock indices are down for the year. We must have forgotten to rake our stocks. #MakeAmericaRakeAgain
1508 2018-11-20 16:20:54 This market can't hold a theme for more than 5 minutes: One minute we're tanking on oil then stocks collapsing, the next we're reversing all those moves for no other reason than they went too far.  Watch for falling cats ;-)

1516 2018-11-20 16:18:59 @Macro_Markets we completely agree. The #Market still has good reason for #bullish sentiment, and yes #tech was very over-priced. Currently we picked up shares that short #volatility in anticipation of a rebound in #stocks which will contribute to a pull-back in the $vix.

1525 2018-11-20 16:16:43 PAST MARKET CRASH of 50%.    On 10/1/07, the Dow was trading at almost $14,000...16 months later it had declined 50% to $7,000.   It took 5 1/2 years before the stocks market again reached $14,000 in early 2013.   So the "buy and hold" strategy isn't always the best strategy.
1526 2018-11-20 16:16:02 @MadMoneyOnCNBC Jim I've been hearing Family & friends that they r NOT going to spending anywhere near what they though this Holidays because of interest rates & downward movement in stocks mkt.

1530 2018-11-20 16:14:20 NEW YORK (AP) — Tech stocks sink again, erasing market's gains for the year; Dow Jones Industrial Average drops 500 points. @AP @DowJones
1531 2018-11-20 16:13:38 We are not in a Bear Market for many reasons. The drop is due from “Big ” cashing in on overpriced FAANG Stocks. Price to earnings or P/E tells the story, and that is share prices were too high. When we get to a correction bottom. I will have my stock selection ready.

1547 2018-11-20 16:08:46 To be a successful investor / trader, it's not about always looking for the next big thing, it's about having the top stocks in each sector and waiting for them to come in...taking a position, and patience.

1558 2018-11-20 16:07:34 Market continues to reprice technology & growth stocks, some individual names retesting lows & trying to potentially turn green. $SPY turned at 265, not 260 area (still suspect, but time will tell). Market continues to  reward stocks w less lofty valuations & low leveraged debt.
1559 2018-11-20 16:07:32 Markets probably go green today as the smart buyers were patient and picked stocks on valuation pullbacks.  Still not buying.  No chasing.

1583 2018-11-20 16:02:37 Tech stocks have fallen, erasing all the gains for the entire year. Is Trump going to take credit for the fall like he did the rise? Then again we all knew that when the economy rises that much that quickly it causes inflation and stock crashes.
1584 2018-11-20 16:02:36 >> and WILL only lose more.  Thus it is impossible for all investors to exit "at the right time" with a profit; and there is no method that will ensure it. 

Those who say that "cryptos are just like stocks" are scammers and should be in jail.
1585 2018-11-20 16:02:30 Wow! Watching local news in California. They said since the day the Democrats won the House the stocks are going down. They haven’t even taken over yet and they are already jacking up the economy.

1599 2018-11-20 16:00:49 True. That makes me think. With so much influence in economics, why does crypto seem to be the more shadowy market although stocks are shadowy by nature? Also great perspective, but this moment trader thing does need to cease in order for confidence having buyers to invest. True?

1610 2018-11-20 15:57:13  Is it a good “shopping” time?

I think it’s about time to do some “shopping” at current levels.

It is almost impossible to predict the short-term bottom, and we might witness further deterioration in the coming days (1 to 3%).

1634 2018-11-20 15:52:35 @HARRISFAULKNER do you think that the Facebook and Apple stocks are down because they have kind of maybe insulted the middle American adult. And this is just kind of payback for insults.
1635 2018-11-20 15:52:29 Bezos could open his wallet and offset that. Sell a few personal stocks...

1643 2018-11-20 15:51:16 News folks, & experts don't get it.  It isn't matter of earning R good or economy is OK. Blinders to ignore overpriced stock are off now.  For while, attitude was "just ignore overpriced, & fundamentals; as long as others buy". Got to point of MORE than 100% over priced stocks.

1650 2018-11-20 15:50:13 Can someone explain to me why stocks, bitcoins, oil markets are bearish ?
1651 2018-11-20 15:50:10 FANG stocks in death cross situation?? It's not always an indicator that the bull market is about to end.
1652 2018-11-20 15:49:50 A "rout in stocks"? Calm down. It's a market correction. They come and they go and then there's a rally. Nervous nellies should not be investing in equities.

1656 2018-11-20 15:49:16 Welcome back boss ... last week i read the book “How to trade stocks” , while reading most of the pages i remembered your lot of tweets . Later I realised the author of this book are same as in your dp... its Jessy Livermore.
1657 2018-11-20 15:48:33 What a morning scare... Tech stocks bouncing back a bit. $NVDA $AMZN.  Careful for the fade (again)
1658 2018-11-20 15:48:32 This is really bad advice. Please don't take it. The NASDAQ is almost down 16% from it's highs. If you have held your stocks for less than a year you will take a 20% hit in capital gains taxes. Thus, this is where you buy solid companies, not sell.
1659 2018-11-20 15:48:10 The expectation is, everyone else should be a consumer, we should invest in what they consume and make money.
Disease, allergies, illness in young age and insurance should increase, we invest in insurance and healthcare stocks.
1660 2018-11-20 15:48:00 Not to mention my stocks are tanking...so yeah, great job on the economy.

1664 2018-11-20 15:47:29 Dang, stocks are taking another hit so far today.  Just 15-min ago, the Dow was DOWN 481.32 points at 24536.12
1665 2018-11-20 15:47:22 An actual deal will reverse all of this, yes.  In every economic cycle, stocks continue higher to make all time-highs even as Feds raise interest rates, even as everyone knew the bull cycle was coming.  This sell off is a deviation and is simply due to the trade tensions.
1666 2018-11-20 15:47:19 Curious if anyone still hodling was around when dotcom bubble burst 2000?

1671 2018-11-20 15:46:12 1. The FANG stocks have an outlier, Facebook, which is confusing the AI.
2. Giving bad guidance and complaining about tariffs that are not showing up in the data are depressing the market.

These are not signs of a recession but hope that there will be one for political reasons.

1677 2018-11-20 15:45:34 FAANG stocks have been overvalued with weak fundamental for far too long.
1678 2018-11-20 15:45:29 Well, really to blame for the boom bust cycle including the stupefying run up in stocks (and debt) and then the inevitable next phase. Which may or may not be starting now.
1679 2018-11-20 15:45:17 But it’s not equal space. They’re over compensating. And it’s working for them. Stocks have soared. So why stop now?

1691 2018-11-20 15:42:54 This! This is where you nailed it. Correct, I'm not switching to different stocks, instead, I'm adding more volatility to my portfolio, which is exactly what I avoid by adding Index Funds.

Thanks!
1692 2018-11-20 15:42:47 Another HJG story that I used in my life. He had purchased ‘worthless’ stocks in a railroad. Events happened that were going to make the stocks skyrocket in value. He prayed to know if he should sell b4 they increased, if wealth was going to make him go bad. He did.
1693 2018-11-20 15:42:36 Hmm, maybe it was tech stocks not tariffs.
1694 2018-11-20 15:42:17 And you know better,right Julie? Markets Fluctuate, Tech Stocks  are in trouble.
1695 2018-11-20 15:42:09 Absolutely. I'm hoping myself that our stocks won't be needed and can be sent to foodbanks or used up slowly.

1700 2018-11-20 15:40:56 They generally wont offer a short position on the poor stocks that are illiquid or if they do its for tiny amounts nd even then they can close you out if there is no long to balance. i tend to go for ones that have risen a lot without substance, but picking an entry is tough

It was 2015 before @NASDAQ reached 4914 again - that was 13 years from the low.
1727 2018-11-20 15:37:19 The latest leg lower for U.S. stocks came after a weekend economic summit of world leaders ended in acrimony, the most recent setback for investors hoping that a resolved U.S.-China tariff fight will help markets stabilize late in the year.

1759 2018-11-20 15:33:03 It's only when people like you and Andurand throw in the towel that oil stocks will start to go back up. Same happened to Andy Hall. He finally called it quits and then oil shot up. This pain will continue to happen until the last bull capitulates.

1829 2018-11-20 15:22:24 As per my tweet earlier.. I was alarmed when I turned on the news this morning- caravans and stocks.. upset about our country 
1830 2018-11-20 15:22:17 Does this rhyme with late 2015-2016?  Oil drop, 4 rate hikes expected in '16, China slowing, high yield energy credit threat to banks...  Tech stocks held up into end of '15 but most stocks already down 10%+.  Techs broke in early '16, sending the indexes down.  1 hike in '16.
1831 2018-11-20 15:21:59 Some Tech stocks getting attractive
1832 2018-11-20 15:21:56 The only real reason is that there is a repeating cycle to this and we have been near the end point of the stock growth cycle and have had some adjustments, at which times we move $ into fixed incomes until the resullting recession wanes, then we begin going back into stocks.

1836 2018-11-20 15:21:09 The last time the U.S. passed significant gun control legislation was in 1994. This year a policy banning bump stocks is the works, but not finalized. I’m alluding to the inertia of the gov’t & people idly accepting the fate of the country by normalizing these shootings.
1837 2018-11-20 15:21:00 Seems pretty close to insider trading. Weird that you can buy property before value skyrockets and its legal, but do the same thing with stocks and you go to federal prison.
1838 2018-11-20 15:20:36 Does today’s DJIA frighten you? Did it move your hand to sell? Do you begin to think there are no good stocks to profit in?

These are normal reactions to a correction. Get a chart of the DJIA corrections then get financial news for those dates. You will see the DJIA rise after.

Coincidence?  I think not!
1854 2018-11-20 15:18:58 Do you have a stock list?  Almost everything is on sale in the stock market (US, and a little in Canada).  I'm still holding on to a lot of cash ... just waiting to pounce on some stocks that I've been waiting for a "black-Friday" sale.
1855 2018-11-20 15:18:51 The stock market’s gains for 2018 were erased on Tuesday, as a sell-off led by giant technology stocks continued for a second day. The renewed declines in the US came after drops in Asia and Europe.
1856 2018-11-20 15:18:47 I think most of these stocks won’t perform well in the future, but claiming “they can just grow more” seems short sighted. Most companies can “make more” of any of their products at anytime, doesn’t mean other companies are going to boom or bust because of it .

1862 2018-11-20 15:17:29 With the AUD and NZD fills eroded (pretty much a wash) and USDCAD at new  highs while stocks are making new lows, I am no longer attached to a  purely USD bearish view; much more it now looks like risk-off may stay at the wheel a while longer, including squeezing EURAUD, /NZD etc
1863 2018-11-20 15:17:06 ...and Trump has already revoked Obama-Era gun background checks for mentally ill. Banning semi-automatics and bump stocks would prevent more dangerous guns capable of mass destruction from circulating. Look into laws in other countries if you want to find more examples.

2146 2018-11-20 14:28:49 Too late. Not going to have that much impact on stock market. Plus it’s a very complicated negotiation. People realize tech stocks are very overvalued, it will go down until correction is done.
2147 2018-11-20 14:28:39 I wonder if @CNBC will have any fund managers on today explaining how rising rates are actually good for stocks and the economy.  Or has that story been put to bed?
2148 2018-11-20 14:28:38 RIP. Also if you are in tech stocks it is likely due to clashes between US and China at a summit over the weekend. Tariffs and what not.
2149 2018-11-20 14:28:23 He’s talking about the SPX. Single stocks can overextended easily.
2150 2018-11-20 14:28:13 tech stocks are taking a hit now.. lately their all down..
2151 2018-11-20 14:28:10 It's always a good sign when investors are fleeing growth stocks for $KO and $VZ.

2156 2018-11-20 14:26:48 Y’all should only buy Chinese stocks for the next few months 
2157 2018-11-20 14:26:42 Stocks are overvalued relative to gold...
2158 2018-11-20 14:26:37 GD you App-Hole. You’re killing off stocks that are valuable to small retailers (square). Turning the market from a positive gain to a volatile market. Thanks. Oh btw your iPad Pro 2018 should be called paper pad.
2159 2018-11-20 14:25:51 Tech stocks are down today guys if y’all care, maybe quick chance to buy in on some.

2162 2018-11-20 14:24:14 Not the day to talk about stocks.
2163 2018-11-20 14:24:01 Tech stocks absolutely brutalized—— Don’t see how these charts can fix themselves any time soon

Bear market looms
2164 2018-11-20 14:24:00 Watch your results pool when you query large collections like NASDAQ and STOCKS. Query less than 2000 results by limiting the price to certain ranges or amt of shares traded.
2165 2018-11-20 14:23:53 Stocks grow concerned over trade issues and what will the Fed do next.
2166 2018-11-20 14:23:46 literally every tesco in manchester stocks good ramen now to the point where some spars are starting to catch on
2167 2018-11-20 14:23:30 Biggest concern for longs I see are how far down support levels are across the board! #sos Stocks are only worth what people are willing to pay for them.  #StockMarket #cryptocurrency #stockmarketcrash $fb $amzn $twtr $aapl $goog $nvda #cryptocrash #bitcoin #banking

Now we 4 vigilant & watching 4 opportunity to capitalize on the capitulation of the most stubborn and undisciplined bulls. No telling when and what levels, but it will happen
2169 2018-11-20 14:22:43 All 30 Dow stocks fall premarket, led by Boeing and Apple

2172 2018-11-20 14:22:00 you have to admit that there has been unending bashing of crypto's by many....i'm sure that was not helpful......maybe bash some stocks as much as crypto and see what happens.
2173 2018-11-20 14:21:59 It means that stocks will go up because of descending wedge as of two days ago man dead stocks would go up but really meant they would go down
2174 2018-11-20 14:21:56 amen. If capital is not completely going to cash or bonds it appears to be rebalancing into different sector stocks?
2175 2018-11-20 14:21:44 Is this week about Cannabis stocks ?
2176 2018-11-20 14:21:43 If stocks go up on this, I think it's time to get a lobotomy because you have to be an idiot to buy this
2177 2018-11-20 14:21:35 Secondly, it was the Swiss and Japanese Central Banks that caused this bubble in the first place by buying high cap stocks.  Sheesh.  Do you understand nothing?
2178 2018-11-20 14:21:24 So you need a semi-automatic or automatic rifles and bump stocks for self defense? Are you defending yourself against the zombies?!?! #commonsensegunlaws #fthenra

2180 2018-11-20 14:20:33 kudlow for saving stocks and stocks wont listen
2181 2018-11-20 14:20:05 When all is said and done, the result of selling is cash. Cash has to go somewhere, Metals? Bonds? Both tough with rising rates. No, that money will find a home, and odds it will be back into stocks. #BTFD
2182 2018-11-20 14:20:03 i am going to keep trading options here, but there are so many damn good stocks on sale, i am going to switch the bulk of my trading over to LT, no doubt about it i am buying up tons of $AMZN. every 50 bucks down buy more. jan i will be laughing...
2183 2018-11-20 14:19:32 @Varneyco Those that bought MSFT early on should not be too upset, as it seems to be one of the more "stable" big tech stocks. While it's taking a hit like the others, it appears to still have a positive future going forward. I've realized decent gains & will hang in there.
2184 2018-11-20 14:19:14 @realDonaldTrump said "If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat."

Cause is debatable but got the direction right...
2185 2018-11-20 14:19:13 looks like a black friday sale for stocks

2187 2018-11-20 14:18:48 I just made $900 in about 5 minutes selling stocks ... makes me want to quit my 9 to 5.
2188 2018-11-20 14:18:07 TWN Stocks: The bad thing about Mitac Holdings (3706 神達) is - and it's real bad - the profits from the sale of Synnex (SNX) stock, which was recorded as a profit in its books, accounted for nearly ALL (93.4%) of its profits for the first 3 quarters of 2018.
2189 2018-11-20 14:17:46 I said this last week & I'll repeat it: Trump thinks his "report card" is the stock market, so he'll make some half-assed deal with China and call it "a great victory." Stocks will pop then reenter a bear market. The place to be positioned for this is agricultural commodities.
2190 2018-11-20 14:17:25 No action in Stocks Under $10 today

2213 2018-11-20 14:09:28 It's fun having to change your fibs every day because stocks keeping falling. Lol
2214 2018-11-20 14:09:16 We used to carry a Stocks cake, Amorosa rolls, onions, Dietz and Watson cheese and sliced steak from Garrisons in Fishtown whenever we traveled.
2215 2018-11-20 14:09:03 Looks like the entire market is gonna act like penny stocks today
2216 2018-11-20 14:09:02 Bearish markets are tough to trade. So much emotion on both sides. Best strategy imo is to look at stocks/etfs you're willing to own at lower prices (and have capital for) and sell puts against those levels.
2217 2018-11-20 14:08:33 No more stock market monitoring for me atm. I am going to be doing something else equally as important  for 2 weeks. 

I'll be back later. People should switch to defensive stocks.

2223 2018-11-20 14:06:22 'All of the fastest growing stocks, the so-called Faangs—Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google’s parent company Alphabet—have moved into bear market territory with their stocks down 20 percent from their peak.'

2227 2018-11-20 14:05:50 TWN Stocks:  The good thing about Mitac Holdings (3706 神達) is: it sold a chunk of Synnex (SNX) shares at the highs this year and bought 'em all back in the high $70's recently.   These fuckers are expert stock pickers!

2230 2018-11-20 14:05:25 'The sell-off was led by high-tech stocks which are sensitive to heightened trade war tensions because of the impact on their global supply chains and fears that trade conflicts will lessen demand for their products.'
2231 2018-11-20 14:04:48 @cnbc @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC Jim there is only one thing tanking these tech stocks and it's the China trade war.  Why?  China could not accede to these demands even if they wanted to.  China is a funhouse inside of a funhouse it's ungovernable.  It's the TRADE WAR.  Period.
2232 2018-11-20 14:04:34 $FB $NFLX etc, FANG stocks taking out OCT lows

2242 2018-11-20 14:02:55 For a newbie trader like myself, the information you're providing really helps in understanding up markets/down markets, trends, what to look for when the market opens and before the market closes. what stocks may be breaking out etc.
2243 2018-11-20 14:02:50 @invest_smart 2% max risk based on most stocks; sometimes less on stocks that I want to absolutely see follow through that day.

2256 2018-11-20 13:57:52 Both are price-agnostic, non-value-conscious trading. It is important not to view them as labels but by their actions. For example, indexing and quant investors may buy stocks and sell stocks at any price. This activity influences share prices.
2257 2018-11-20 13:57:39 Despite recent turbulence,the longest bull market in U.S. history is still intact & the S&P 500 is only trading about 9% below the record high it from September,but over 40% of the S&P stocks are down at least 20%.

2272 2018-11-20 13:54:26 The difference being, no dumb ass kid talked dad into stocks. Oh, and bitcoin down just a tad more than $SPY over the last year.
2273 2018-11-20 13:54:03 Let us be honest here.  These tech stocks are way over valued.  Amazon shares going for $1,000/share!  Really???  Come on.  These stocks are worth UNDER $100/share EACH!
2274 2018-11-20 13:54:00 We find it "amusing" to see & hear all of the #projections" on #StockMarketNews (#Bears or #Bulls) when you realize top 1% own over EIGHTY PERCENT of all stocks so WHATEVER happens it will be largely insulated from masses

Whatever you were planning to do, are you gonna pull the trigger at the open or wait for a while? I see a lot of stocks to buy but...
2281 2018-11-20 13:51:37 When stocks are in the shitter I sometimes ask myself “What would Jack Bauer do?”
2282 2018-11-20 13:51:15 Who cares about your ideas. You’re a member of the nra, you don’t run it. You support the nra policies, not your fake hypothetical policies you make up on twitter. The nra does not support raising the age limit. The nra does not support banning bump stocks. That’s what u support
2283 2018-11-20 13:51:13 Gonna keep buying puts and use the profit to buy into long term stocks when the bottom hits. .
2284 2018-11-20 13:50:56 In other news, $EXTR names a new cfo- old controller at $CA- one of a few tech stocks where fundies inflecting +, with very attractive valuation and a new buyback- buyer on pullbacks
2285 2018-11-20 13:50:54 It’a dumb to just have money sitting in your bank account. He probably has money invested in stocks.
2286 2018-11-20 13:49:56 Did I mention #stocks look ugly this morning? Did I mention I am off the rest of the week? #HappyThanksgiving  early.
2287 2018-11-20 13:49:54 I think the spring is coiled for rates to retrace somewhat higher while stocks really get slammed lower. Powell and Brainard said financial imbalances caused previous recessions and wanted to let some air out. How quickly can/will they backpedal? #PowellPut
2288 2018-11-20 13:49:49 At what level in the Nasdaq waterfall decline does the Fed start jawboning.  Stocks like TGT getting hammered, down 10 %.
2289 2018-11-20 13:49:45 That’s always a solid recommendation...never hurts to try a whisky at a bar first, assuming you can find a bar that stocks it.
2290 2018-11-20 13:48:59 Wasn't expecting 680 to break today.. anyway nifty trail stops did hit, stocks didnt hit.. gira kya aakhirkaar 100 point main.. ops ne manage karke kaam kia lagta hai to kal bhagega
2291 2018-11-20 13:48:51 Basi nalate lang diay ilang stocks. Hahahaha. Go ka lang.
2292 2018-11-20 13:48:17 Hala grabi huhu when daw new stocks?
2293 2018-11-20 13:48:17 Excellent.  Futures needed to come down last night with stocks down so much.  They did. It was a gift.  Hope you took advantage.
2294 2018-11-20 13:48:06 I retired last year at 62. Had always managed my family's plan but for peace of mind recently got a 2nd opinion from a fee only planner. Our plan works at 4.95% return. 57% stocks, 38% bonds, 5% cash. SS at 70. If we could get 6.3% would be very happy.
2295 2018-11-20 13:47:28 Believe it or not, however these dropdowns make me fall in love with crypto even more.

So many scalp opportunities and so many interesting investing possibilities (don't think about stocks, they'll drop).

Also motivates me more to finish the goddamn study. Opportunity costs.

2300 2018-11-20 13:45:58 People who traded stocks for a long time.  Does this feel materially different than anything in the past five/six years?  We’ve had panics before.  Jan 2016, Brexit, trumps election limit down, feb of this year, Italy panic this year.  Where are we?  This feels different/worse..
2301 2018-11-20 13:45:35 @MorningsMaria Tech getting slaughtered. E.G. AAPL. 
Q. Who is buying these stocks?
2302 2018-11-20 13:45:07 One of the key mechanisms has been the debasement of gbp by BOE Carney Gov. etc. It's pushed everybody down & those at bottom fall into poverty. Unsound fiat money transfers wealth to the top as the everything bubble inflates they gain disproportionately (property stocks bonds)
2303 2018-11-20 13:45:06 OptionHacker alerted traders to bullish unusual option activity in 9 stocks Monday including $CNQ, $CIEN and  $TGT.   Top performer was a same-day gain of 11% in $AA where December 35.0 calls bought for $1.15 closed at $1.27.

2305 2018-11-20 13:44:25 I wouldn’t bet on it. All stocks drop in a bear market , and clearly they are following the overall market now so don’t see why it will stop

2314 2018-11-20 13:41:16 @SPYJared good luck on the floor tonight. Futures looking ugly at the moment. Retail stocks really couldnt find a savior for this week.
2315 2018-11-20 13:40:58 Weird. Mine is doing fine. Is yours only invested in the few large market share stocks that are dragging down the index values? Oh wait 401ks don't work like that. They are invested in many things
2316 2018-11-20 13:40:34 $hd $low always go over all your options with stocks and horses. Buy low sell high? The trend is your friend
2317 2018-11-20 13:40:26 Still seeing a big rotation of capital overall. Money leaving most stocks, crypto and moving into bonds, gold and other contrarian plays. Gold looking strong off support right now. Capital always looking for suitable home.
2318 2018-11-20 13:40:08 Not a good time to be in tech stocks as the global sell-off continues. Much downward pressure but on the flip side, cheaper to get in on some now?

2331 2018-11-20 13:35:20 The only reason the stores were able to do that in the first place was the super low print run, and because it wasn't available in the big box stores like Walmart

Can't speak for the (probably large) print run here, but Walmart stocks it, so much harder to price gouge

2340 2018-11-20 13:33:32 Okay. Yeah I’m still receiving the dividends from the stocks. Would you advise in buying more?
2341 2018-11-20 13:33:20 We need a relief bounce... we’d be lucky to get back to 5k... then down some more. Stocks look ok today.
2342 2018-11-20 13:33:17 Valuable asset has to drive income while increasing the capital value. Real estate, dividend paying stocks, interest paying bank account, your bbq set you cook & sell for the neigborhood, tools that you rent out, machinery you manufacture with. What can you do with bitcoin?
2343 2018-11-20 13:33:08 1/2: Stocks continue to lose up to 50% of their value since the #TrumpTaxCut that was supposedly providing “stimulus.” Ask what these #GOP bag of tricks really do for a sustainable economy? Zero. They produce short-term sugar highs leaving #US w/mountains of debt, cuts to

2347 2018-11-20 13:31:55 To late with his tax break to the 1% because that bubble will burst and wall street will tumble and only thing that will be left is the rising debt. Then the 1% will buy stocks pennies on the dollar after 401k's have been taken out by American's trying to survive at half value.
2348 2018-11-20 13:30:20 Spoke with a guy in the summer who told me he was big on Bombardier and airline stocks. I said “Really?? Aren’t those guys always in financial trouble?” He just smiled and said “Yep. And the government can’t let them fail, so they bail them out. Every time.”

2355 2018-11-20 13:27:11 Actually a US right-wing think tank discovered in the 70s that it is not higher _income_ per se that turns people right-wing, but becoming a homeowner instead of a renter, driving instead of using public transport, and owning stocks instead of a pension.

2358 2018-11-20 13:26:34 I rarely trade stocks which have a large dividend. You can have some REITS in your portfolio in bad times, but only if the REIT stock is not losing over time. It does not make sense to have a dividend of 7% if the stock loses 20%. The loss is 13% then.
2359 2018-11-20 13:25:46 My eyes are everywhere mate. Have stocks going up all over the place. Cant keep up. #ALGW looks great, could see 4p today at this rate, Boom no-one selling.

2387 2018-11-20 13:13:55 Calling out individual stocks as being in a #bearmarket validates the terrible idea of looking at individual performers in portfolios versus the bottom line number. If the market drops 20% and you go down 10%, it doesn't matter if 1 or 2 of your stocks cut in half.

2403 2018-11-20 13:05:28 Little money rules that I always tell my younger siblings to follow

1. Don't shop everything that's going up
2. Start as early as possible
3. Never borrow to buy stocks
4. Don't fall for chit funds to earn quick money
5. Invest in terms of decades, not a few months
6. Avoid debt

2411 2018-11-20 13:02:38 Wow, woke up to see another weak open ahead for stocks.  Getting ugly
2412 2018-11-20 13:02:37 Bonds back to where the selloff bigly accelerated on 10/3. Stocks, well, not so much. Funny how it works like that.
2413 2018-11-20 13:01:35 Investors looked to sell stocks as cues emerged that RBI’s measures to boost lending could take some time to be implemented.  Selling was most visible among sectors such as IT, metals and  pharmaceuticals.

2416 2018-11-20 13:01:06 there is absolutely zero reason to buy stocks today at this point.  maybe bernanke will do a surprise 50bp rate cut....oh wait, nvm
2417 2018-11-20 13:01:04 Asian stock markets ended lower today as global growth worries persisted and a sell-off in technology stocks continued on worries about slackening demand. Australia ASX (-0.4%), Kospi (-1%), Nikkei (-1.1%), Hang Seng (-2%), and Shanghai Composite (-2.1%) all ended in in red today

2420 2018-11-20 12:59:23 I’m implying that getting a gun shouldn’t be easier than getting dinner reservations at Be Our Guest in Magic Kingdom. I’m implying that certain accessories like bump stocks and weapons should be banned.

2433 2018-11-20 12:54:11 Today we might see a strong bull rally of the double bottom on a handful of stocks. Short lived but strong. Bear trap into a bull trap.
2434 2018-11-20 12:53:39 Here come the furu marketing tweets about stuff they posted but didn’t trade  running a sub service must be hard when stocks don’t go up everyday lol
2435 2018-11-20 12:53:04 some perspective on high flying growth stocks... $PAYC now -30% from high... but still +40% YTD.
2436 2018-11-20 12:52:38 Stock markets have taken a beating too. Some investors may be moving crypto money to reinvest in traditional stocks. Crypto markets will return. When Ripple or Stellar hits $1 in value, it's going to be hard for banks to use Visa & MC, even w/ banks sharing Visa/MC profits.

Reminder to President Trump that the republican base gives no shit about Stock Market, as top 10% of Americans own 84% of stocks, bottom 50% owns no stocks at all.

2456 2018-11-20 12:44:53 Looks like we may need to crowdfund a rally in stocks these days. In the absence of any obvious catalyst for a rally, the odds are increasing that we go straight down to ~2100. That said, support at last week's low of 2670 and 2600.  #SPX

2467 2018-11-20 12:39:18 Big relief for the Banking sector (and stocks) is the significant dilution in rate hike fears (immediate Repo rate outlook at 6.25-6.50%) and the resultant trend down in buy & hold zone from 8.20-8.35% to 7.85-8.0% (rest of 2018 focus shift from 7.85-8.20% to 7.65-8.0%)

2475 2018-11-20 12:34:09 Next are the defensive stocks and the DJT stocks. When they get hit, we will be at a bottom.
2476 2018-11-20 12:31:46 A lot of conflicting soothsayers out there.  As many had said and I believe, the market had been hot for too long, driving up stock prices that didn't make sense.  Over priced stocks will eventually be oversold.
2477 2018-11-20 12:31:25 exactly my point. 'your' stocks --didn't do poorly but the majority did very poorly. 'your' stocks are index movers but so many underneath were horific

2654 2018-11-20 10:24:29 Ok if it is just stocks you are kinda right. But some companies which stocks price plummetted use this as reason for stagnant if not lower wages. Though bursa isnt the only stock market that could give affect in certain scenario. Hence the ripple effect.

2722 2018-11-20 09:26:35 Reason stocks get punished in times like now in UK is that political uncertainty is very hard to price in to a market, because no-one really knows how long it will last or how deep the economic effect will be. So it's times like this that serious money can be made - or lost.
2723 2018-11-20 09:25:54 impact of trade war increases, inflated growth expectations will correct. Stocks, real estate, corporate debt (especially low grade) and commodities are now reacting to this. But signs were there for a while. Now the sell-off is gathering pace.

2782 2018-11-20 08:27:41 Hey @WeekendInvestng , i recently saw your webinar on TradeGyani Channel. There you mentioned a simple trick that if your strategy is to keep a portfolio of top10 stocks then if on next rebalancing date if the earlier top10 are among current top25, they stay or they are replaced.

2790 2018-11-20 08:15:42 Overseas investors were net buyers of Philippine stocks today at $10.04m

Highest net foreign buying since Nov. 7, 2018

FOREIGN BUYING: Php 3,515,428,705.95

2791 2018-11-20 08:13:33 It is eventually the time when we need to time the market although timing the market takes a genius approach and it's extremely difficult. Buying and hold won't work anymore the way it has worked so far. Going long and short is a zero-sum game. Picking stocks is a zero-sum game.

2796 2018-11-20 08:10:59 The fed will increase interest rates in a few weeks. Stocks decline. Negative financial news. What the fuck does that do to BTC. Wasn’t it a store of value or something

2799 2018-11-20 08:08:11 BTW is the budget going to be ready for tax payers to read in January or is the Government going to shut down again by 535 people making $172,000/yr because nobody is buying products from the stocks they hols?

2801 2018-11-20 08:07:34 It's amazing how you see things differently than they really are. I remember Mark Cuban said he was going to sell all his stocks in the first year because a trump presidency would ruin the economy. That hasn't happened in fact the economy is improving. Trump is correct

2803 2018-11-20 08:05:53 EA stocks have actually fallen from 150 to 85. TAKE THAT EA. YOU SUCK. YOU FUCKING SUCK. After all, the CCO of EA games said, if you don't like it, don't buy it in reaction to BF5. Yeah that's exactly what we are doing EA. (1/2)
2804 2018-11-20 08:04:35 Apart from decent dividends FTSE 100 has been the most disappointing international index from mature markets!

2811 2018-11-20 08:01:41 The real question is, how did we go from the worlds largest creditor with 2/3rds the worlds gold stocks and 1/2 the worlds manufacturing to where we are now?
2812 2018-11-20 08:00:37 While they buy cheap stocks, remember when these crooks at Goldman were telling their customers to buy and they were selling. These ppl at Goldman are the biggest crooks going. @realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo

2816 2018-11-20 07:58:29 . @RonPaul recently asked his Twitter followers in what form they would prefer to receive $10,000 if they had to keep it in that form for a decade. The majority picked #Bitcoin. However, he didn’t mention #stocks, #realestate or #altcoins. So what would you choose?

2818 2018-11-20 07:53:32 What do our younger stocks look like Iron I would be happy to shell that out to some young up and coming players but if not, I say Johnson as well.
2819 2018-11-20 07:52:20 Also no study is made of the CO2 outgassing that happens for Miles around non active volcanoes on land.. or hot spots due to underground heating of mass carbon stocks...
2820 2018-11-20 07:50:54 You would think being in a bear market for the past quarter with stocks tanking and $TSLA , $TSLAQ would be getting pretty darn close bring margin called.
2821 2018-11-20 07:50:42 99 % of the ICOs ( Initial Coin Offerings ) have lost 99 % of the value.

I guess for crypto bulls explaining such losses to girl friends is easier than explaining  losses in gold/silver mining stocks to  wives.
2822 2018-11-20 07:50:12 Quality stocks should have quality management, good ROCE,ROE, good performance record for last 10-15 years , may be 15% CAGR.
2823 2018-11-20 07:48:52 Is it me or FAANG Stocks really distorted our view of indexes moves. Bringing false sens of bullishness and bearishness? And desynchronizing US from global equity markets?

2829 2018-11-20 07:46:29 Its true. If you can no longer deduct property taxes & local taxes.  You pay more fed taxes. Tax cut did nothing for most of us.  What would've been better is investing in the ppl/infrastructure. That would be jobs & a better economy.  Not just stocks

2846 2018-11-20 07:26:28 this is all very illuminating, but might some of the cross ownership of stocks be nothing more than normal portfolio investments for corporations like these?
2847 2018-11-20 07:24:54 Hurt? HA! More money in our pocket, our military being restored, funds are being cut to PPH, companies returning to the USA, bonuses being given at work, stocks at an all time high  (oh, oops maybe you don't own any stock?) We've already established you're delusional BEX

2851 2018-11-20 07:24:03 Real estate isn’t like stocks or bonds. Following house price indices is mostly pointless. 

They create these nationwide home prices measurements which are pretty irrelevant to what is actually going on.

You got to go looking at the real asking prices, price /m2 and so forth.
2852 2018-11-20 07:23:51 Thank u. I think it would be nice to check the volatility correlation with known high beta, high volatility stocks with their returns performance over various time frames. This can probably give better understanding. Any list of high beta stocks which can be used for comparison?

2861 2018-11-20 07:06:21 Si stanno risistemando le cose, molti titoli erano cresciuti troppo e ingiustificatamente come spesso avviene sui mercati, sono correzioni naturali, che preludono poi il tanto annunciato “big one”, il nuovo 2008 #financial #markets #trading #stocks #selloff #borsa #azioni
2862 2018-11-20 07:05:14 Preeti,(Am a senior citizen,so I call you by your name) don't listen to others when investing. Particularly news channels. All have their own vested interests.  Have a few good stocks for long term. Enjoy small trades. Enjoy the conversation between dumb and dumber!
2863 2018-11-20 07:04:39 Well first of all it is advertorial in biz of selling stocks and enthusiasm on behalf of the investments community. So it's never impartial. There's also a crossover into partisanship if you look at who funds the papers or media. Big oil naturally par ex.

2875 2018-11-20 06:50:27 I like to focus on what matters: company research, and reading investing books/letters/memos.

All of the following is a complete waste of time, and should be avoided:
1. Reading market news
2. Reading macroeconomic forecasts
3. Checking your stocks any more than once per week
2876 2018-11-20 06:49:38 Thanks for your concern. I shorted on the 420 tweet. Got in at 370. Was up huge. Underestimated Elon’s ability to fraudulate. Covered. Will be back in when the dust settles. Shitlrting other stocks you are probably long like square

2883 2018-11-20 06:38:52 Sorry, that’s not true. The courts have thrown back the case to the SEC to re-evaluate what they considered was undue haste by the DOJ. The government wrongly accuses Rappler as a dealer of stocks when it’s a media company. Ps., PDRs do NOT denote foreign ownership. 
2884 2018-11-20 06:37:53 When financials go bad even for external reasons, all cry loud. but when economy & financials do good, all go mute n shut for political reasons. India doing pretty good.

2895 2018-11-20 06:28:25 The reason I don't like stocks is because I can't invest in new IPOs. But with BTC I can invest in ICOs without worrying about inflation.  Ontop of that if I were to buy a house in the US, it would be using BTC which has never been hacked and won't need to worry about government

2931 2018-11-20 06:05:03 Funny thing is is that they don’t contribute much to the economy. They mainly invest their money in stocks. The economy thrives because of the middle class. Though it is getting harder to do that now since our economy is about as fucked as a college student.
2932 2018-11-20 06:04:44 My volatility calculations are nowhere near as sophisticated as the Sortino ratio, so it's good to know that some of my stocks pass the Sortino test.  I'm sure the last few additions to my portfolio don't show up on the list as they are quite volatile.

3128 2018-11-20 03:22:45 @BTBouillon OMG thank you for all of your vegetarian beef/chicken stocks. My fiancé is veg and I'm not and this week we made poutine with "beef" gravy and French onion soup! I couldn't notice the difference!

3130 2018-11-20 03:19:15 Background checks, no gun show loopholes, licensing, red flag warnings. No high speed magazines, no bump stocks...what is needed is an adult conversation about what is needed in this society. I agree with @billpeduto, but let's talk about it...that's first.
3131 2018-11-20 03:18:34 $XLK Technology ETF has broken below Oct 29 low (65.59). It should extend lower to 60.5. Not good for $NQ_F & other tech stocks #elliottwave

3140 2018-11-20 03:11:43 $EAST.V has traded 70 M shares in the last 3 months - i.e. averaging well over 1 M shares daily: When people are getting hurt on fundamentally bad stocks, they will massacre a fundamentally good stock - that has good volume - just to get liquid... #EastWest is a case in point.
3141 2018-11-20 03:11:43 at this rate, the next mania will be shorting every financial asset in sight. right? #stocks #bonds

3143 2018-11-20 03:11:03 When I ran street stocks @ThunderRoadVT in late 80's we ran reverse stagger on rear of car. We were not allowed jacking bolts. We also ran soft springs. Loved how  the car sat in the high banks.
3144 2018-11-20 03:10:26 Not really, I did crypto right before it exploded last december made like 3k profit but have been considering stocks lately. Coca Cola hasn’t lost value in like 5+ years lol
3145 2018-11-20 03:09:58 Below 26100, selling momentum will gain pace for Bank Nifty. Bears will gain momentum between area of 26100-26140.

3159 2018-11-20 03:04:15 Totally with you on that. GE stocks is in the dumpster too. Don’t waste your money just because it’s cheaper. We live in a throwaway society. But 1.5 years is really ridiculous. You should have gotten 5+ more years. It’s not like you do 10 loads a day? Do you . Not funny.
3160 2018-11-20 03:02:57 U.S. Market Check
Weakness in some of the biggest technology companies sent U.S. stocks tumbling as pessimism about escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China added to concerns about potential new regulations coming for the industry.
The yield on 10-yr Treasuries held
3161 2018-11-20 03:02:13 Is it false to call stocks gambling?
3162 2018-11-20 03:01:39 Vegas took multiple heavily modified weapons(you can't get bump stocks any more, btw, the manufacturer quit after vegas), and a literal rocket scientist to make it happen. It's horrible, but it's almost impossible to replicate

3174 2018-11-20 02:53:35 Most unionists are now public servants, and most media, ABC, 9+10 are all lefty, so these new appointees will be there for 20 yrs and Shorten will get a couple of terms at least to build up his union stocks and media collectivism .
3175 2018-11-20 02:52:51 agree with your cautious view on stocks but with no cash flow streams for btc how can you be so sure?
3176 2018-11-20 02:51:05 30d is the key one- it tells us that value is in utility- and XRP is the only coin with utility. Remember the big sell off of internet stocks in the tech boom/bust, only a few had real value and survived long term....
3177 2018-11-20 02:51:01 But why do you think those flows of money come in to begin with? Why are stocks worth anything at all?

3180 2018-11-20 02:48:21 My portfolio was down massively too, but I got some great black Friday deals on stocks
3181 2018-11-20 02:48:14 Same reason why entertainers are more famous than scientists. Entertainers/actors appeal to mass audience but audience for science is a limited group of people, same is true for stocks.
3182 2018-11-20 02:48:01 Stocks go up like an escalator,  and down like an elevator.
3183 2018-11-20 02:47:42 Becoz you are there to talk stocks which will not perform.
3184 2018-11-20 02:46:57 Second half will be good as we may see some pull back towards positive territory .

Oil stocks, Banking stocks and irrigation related stocks can look for either side gains.
3185 2018-11-20 02:46:35 All the FAANG stocks are highly overvalued & most of them are valued for their future potential rather than what they are earning today.
3186 2018-11-20 02:46:09 It's not a loss if you didn't sell. I will still bet @officialmcafee 's dick that at some point next year #Bitcoin will reach all time highs again. Just got to be patient. Hindsight is always 20/20. Have foresight to sell US stocks and buy gold/silver/btc now.
3187 2018-11-20 02:45:17 All the FAANG stocks are highly overvalued & most of them are valued for their future potential rather than what they are earning today.
3188 2018-11-20 02:44:52 That's what am telling in the bull market stocks will perform and in bear market will not. Why are you talking about stocks that are performing well
3189 2018-11-20 02:44:23 I miss the 16-17 #Celtics right about now. Underdogs who threw it all at the wall and laid it all out on the court for their brothers.

3190 2018-11-20 02:43:37 #ForThanksgivingMyPsychicSaid WW stocks will rise considerably.
3191 2018-11-20 02:43:32 You are correct, I might sell them and start buying those stocks in 2 or 3 tranches. That way if stocks keep coming down, I will keep averaging down

Thanks!

Is Twitter biased. No doubt.

The fact is @jack did not take action against @misskaul who made offensive posts of our PM.
3198 2018-11-20 02:39:12 Also there are many stocks told by me which are down today.. But how you perform overall is important.. Just becoz u chose in so many stocks 1, and then it fell, don't blame others.

3247 2018-11-20 02:11:55 @monkey_trading what scanners do you use to find stocks to trade?
3248 2018-11-20 02:11:27 $SPY I'm not so focused on what the popular stocks of the day are but rather which ones may well be there next. i.e. $NIO There it is!  :)

3251 2018-11-20 02:10:03 All OPV2 stocks (outside of very specific WHO-certified/national labs) were *certified as destroyed* before bOPV switch in 2016. There should be no OPV2 anywhere in India or Indonesia at all. That signals a problem, somewhere.
3252 2018-11-20 02:10:02 Laughing stocks of the country.
3253 2018-11-20 02:08:29 Really wish I hadn't sold all my rake stocks
3254 2018-11-20 02:07:46 Agreed, and if you read my initial post - what I feel has CHANGED is the technology of the accessories (high cap mags, material scinece, bump stocks,  etc) which make the weapons vastly more deadly.

3256 2018-11-20 02:06:48 Hey Eric @ericnuttall , we both love energy stocks! However you are a bad investor (got in too early) I will give you a chance to redeem yourself 

I challenge you to a 90 days canadian energy portfolio competition!! Loser has to donate $5000 charity of choice . Do you accept?
3257 2018-11-20 02:05:04 Twitter is biased, no doubt.

The fact is no action was taken against @misskaul Twitter Director of Policy who made offensive posts about our PM.

But the share drop today has nothing to do with the poster.

DOW fell by 400 and all tech stocks got hammered.
3258 2018-11-20 02:04:55 Since we're discussing prison reform, let's make sure tRump and his #CrimeFamily are allowed outside every weekend, and placed in stocks in a public square, so ordinary Americans can spit and piss on them, and kick them in the face. Restoring confidence in justice will help USA!
3259 2018-11-20 02:03:35 Stocks are too
3260 2018-11-20 02:03:21 Don’t get to caught up in the “noise” of cannabis stocks. They won’t all be big movers but they will all move. Find that coke, monster, fb and Tilray.. although Tilray will fall, $KGKG $MGON $HIPH $CANB WILL BE YOUR LEADERS
3261 2018-11-20 02:02:59 I’m all about it trust me! I’m hoping it continues to drop tech stocks till Xmas. Might be time to snatch up some appl shares if it keeps dipping for another week or two
3262 2018-11-20 02:02:07 I was talking about tech stocks :)
3263 2018-11-20 02:01:38 What history?  Did they refused your services?  So far everything you've pointed out about how bad $MMEN.C is  has also been shown in the stocks you claim are real companies.  I'll definitely be cross-referencing your comments to your great picks. 
3264 2018-11-20 02:00:57 I keep at least 25% of my portfolio in Index Funds (SP500 and NASDAQ)

Due to recent market events, I'm seriously considering selling those ETF and loading up on my favorite stocks at discount prices due to today's correction.

Thoughts?

3266 2018-11-20 02:00:06 The stocks are falling because the DemoRATS won the house and it will go down more because of the DemoRATS

3271 2018-11-20 01:53:42 Outside of penny stocks. My best movers are $YECO it had a huge move of 25% off a double bottom today. $JONE 10.90% today after hitting ANL it bounced back the last 3 trading days. Don’t get tunnel vision - look at those 2-5$ stocks also
3272 2018-11-20 01:53:04 Lot of crowded stocks there.
3273 2018-11-20 01:52:53 Bitcoin is a thing, Adam. I understand your arrogant disbelief now, but like anything else in stocks it was a gamble and frankly the idea had way more legs then a slot machines.
3274 2018-11-20 01:52:44 the problem with basing our entire economy around stocks is that we are almost all entirely too dumb for it
3275 2018-11-20 01:49:00 Seems I need to send you a few pentagon studies then - also bump stocks suck, they are a gimmick, in the event of govt vs citizens the pentagon has determined that upwards of 80-85% of active military will leave to defend home & family. The govt is just people, continued-
3276 2018-11-20 01:46:24 Yea I saw got a good scalp trade out of it. But worried as this was 1/3 risks I had against my thesis.
3277 2018-11-20 01:45:16 Yes, during the 2001 dotcom bust.  The word "Internet stock" such as Amazon or Yahoo was forbidden during holiday gatherings or friends social events.

Did you buy any internet stocks?  "Not me, I stayed away from risky things like that".
3278 2018-11-20 01:45:01 Let’s get back to your tyrannical government. You say guns to protect against that. Give me your game plan to defend against the military? Bump stocks won’t cut it against military armorment.  

This isn’t Red Dawn. You have command and control centers set up? Supply chain? No...
3279 2018-11-20 01:43:01 Things like concealed carry, semiautomatic rifles, and bump stocks are terrible ideas. In the Wild West, you weren’t even allowed to bring a gun into some towns. And the Dicky Amendment is the worst; if we want to be able to reduce gun violence, we need to be able to research it.
3280 2018-11-20 01:42:36 As we progress, people will start batting down the hatches and not spend as much. People spend more when their stocks are up, less when down. This, of course, can lead to a domino effect.
3281 2018-11-20 01:41:25 I did the same last night Gerald; shameful.  Placed an order on 11/11, great discount; informed yesterday seller doesn’t have stocks and cannot fulfill order; checked Lazada online, same seller, selling the very same item, at the regular price 
3282 2018-11-20 01:41:06 Been a while since I traded basura stocks haha I hope Starbucks offered delivery services.
3283 2018-11-20 01:41:02 As of 9:35 a.m., PSEi 7,202.09 down 68.17 points or 0.94 percent #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
3284 2018-11-20 01:40:23 FTSE is mainly governed by non-UK stocks (and the impact of £rate obvs). I took a bunch of money out to see what 2019 brings to stock market (inc £rate effect) and house market ...
3285 2018-11-20 01:40:15 Yes, I'm referring to the moat. These stocks have done well because there moats WERE strong. Some will continue to be so, others may be not. What are we voting for? Past moats or future moats? Not talking stock performance.
3286 2018-11-20 01:40:07 I’ve been saying this for a while: the average investor holds these stocks redundantly in multiple funds or ETFs and is overexposed to this group.
3287 2018-11-20 01:40:00 Every day, again, I am amazed by how investors refuse to acknowledge the overall environment for #equities has changed; they continue judging events through the same eyes as pre-October. Adaptation, anyone? #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks
3288 2018-11-20 01:39:59 Lithium and retail = hated by the market. I'd say a pretty good bet if you went long all these stocks and held for a year you'd make very very good money! But would take some serious contrarian balls.
3289 2018-11-20 01:37:00 Very true. Coz they buy stocks and we own businesses.
3290 2018-11-20 01:36:43 Pot stocks.  It's liquid gold

3293 2018-11-20 01:34:52 re-reading my @markminervini  books, they are most clear to me. Then going to read 'how to trade stocks' by Jesse Livermore for the first time and re-read Market Wizards, then re-read reminiscences of a stock operator. By then ill probably read Marks books for a 4th time lol.
3294 2018-11-20 01:32:53 I made $2 today trading stocks your newest self made millionaire is on the way
3295 2018-11-20 01:32:32 Think that could accelerate things? HF had to be loaded up on these growth stocks. Any big selling pressure could turn catastrophic.
3296 2018-11-20 01:32:19 Well stocks like ATT and Exon Mobile and Walmart all pay pretty good dividends and you know they're still gonna be here in 5 years. 

Can I say the same for $BTC? Ehhh maybe. Can I say the same for $XRP? Probably not.
3297 2018-11-20 01:30:52 Just looked up the S&P500 energy stocks...or what appeared to be...some double digit negative ytd returns for all but a handful.
3298 2018-11-20 01:30:08 $SPY Be careful of falling into the trap of watching your stocks go lower and lower, only to end selling (a lot lower). Have an exit plan.

3300 2018-11-20 01:28:47 My stocks been going up like a crescendo
3301 2018-11-20 01:26:39 I'm personally bothered that the bubbliest of all tech bubble stocks is somehow immune to the rest of the market correcting.
3302 2018-11-20 01:25:21 That's not the reason. The broader US market and particularly NASDAQ dropped 2.5%. Tech stocks took most of the hit. It's not because of us. 
3303 2018-11-20 01:23:51 Most sectors have been lower most of the year but the FANG stocks and weed stocks have gotten the most attention.
3304 2018-11-20 01:23:13 The problem with pump and dump stocks is... You don't know when they are about to dump

You may buy in at the top, and be dumped on

3310 2018-11-20 01:19:10 If you buy a stock that it's true intrinsic value is $1 and you initially buy shares at $0.40 , you should be happy if the stock slides to $0.20 , gives you the opportunity to acquire more at a cheaper average cost!

3327 2018-11-20 01:12:43 @DougKass Love how they joke about the fall of Bitcoin, laughing at Tom Lee's call.   They were so irresponsible in pumping it for months, and now have nothing to do with it.  Same with pot stocks.   Meanwhile last calls, LULU, AAPL, BABA, LEN,  all losers.
3328 2018-11-20 01:10:27 US stocks down and in correction territory. My positions suffered a bit too but that’s okay. I always sell covered calls to hedge my bet. Yet, where is the presidential tweet about the stock market ?

3336 2018-11-20 01:07:26 That's what I actually did (twice this year, first in Jan/Feb, second from late June-Oct). Albeit traded around some and careful timing (entry points) and a mix of IWM and individual stocks. YTD PL: +44%. The cost of the call option hedges was about 6% (i.e. would be up +50%).
3337 2018-11-20 01:06:37 @realDonaldTrump @chinascio Hi again, my friends. I sort of expected a few bumps in the road. But I also would like to see everyone reach a common ground soon. Stocks took a hit today after your words. But to me, this isn't just about the stock market and the global economy.
3338 2018-11-20 01:04:54 The crazy part is how high these stocks were bid up . Just ridiculous that so many mega cap stocks can be in a bubble
3339 2018-11-20 01:04:47 There’s just no way the #FAANG stocks can fall in the next 2 months the way they have the last 2, at some point people WILL buy them!

3351 2018-11-20 00:57:12 For the market as a whole?  I don’t think it is.  However, there’s still too much froth in the technology sector.  Stocks like $AMZN and $NFLX...and even $AAPL are still too high.

3365 2018-11-20 00:46:45 Who didn't see that #stocks were a bubble long ago?
Soaring stocks, near-flat incomes, high percentage of currently working in nil-wage jobs, a visible economy largely of nil-wage jobs - housing bubble pattern all over.
3366 2018-11-20 00:46:39 I love when newbs get rekt.  Probably never was good at stocks either.  FYI you make just as much money shorting in a bear market.  Not sure what you are losing when you have the option to make profits with up or down price action.

3368 2018-11-20 00:42:52 Dow closes down 396 points as Facebook, Apple stocks fall! This is your doing Donnie Trump.  Happened on your watch!  You own it!
3369 2018-11-20 00:40:55 All whil tech stocks are plunging just as bad
3370 2018-11-20 00:40:48 #RBA minutes released and #AUD motionless at the moment -- figures too with what's happening in equity markets across the globe. No room for risk. #ASX down today: healthcare and IT stocks seeing some of the most activity, in sympathy with the sell-off in the #NASDAQ.
3371 2018-11-20 00:40:15 @nabtrade wtf is wrong with your platform. The order pads keep showing different stocks to what I clicked on.

3373 2018-11-20 00:36:38 .@Airport_West_FC is looking to add Greenvale youngster Jayden Ranno to its growing playing stocks for 2019. The 21yo made his senior Jets debut in 2016, the same year he represented the EDFL at U19 Interleague level under Geoff Maddern.

3374 2018-11-20 00:35:36 CNBC: Australia stocks lower following Wall Street selloff

CNBC: The ASX 200 was down 0.57 percent in early trade, with almost all sectors in negative territory. The energy sector slipped by 0.79 percent while industrials declined 0.86 percent....

3375 2018-11-20 00:34:14 Right now no one thats smart is long stocks at end of bull - while crypto longs are getting hammered at what's hopefully the tail end of the bear - next year equals: long crypto and short stocks?
3376 2018-11-20 00:34:04 i’m gonna fucking cry if i cancel my order and the stocks don’t come back
3377 2018-11-20 00:33:54 In that there's no snowballing mechanics at all, every single stock starts dead even, you don't carry any advantage between stocks at all, save for maybe stored charge attacks?
3378 2018-11-20 00:32:33 It’s hard to price some things because like stocks prices change frequently
3379 2018-11-20 00:32:30 I saw a comment on dean cains page, these snowflakes are spreading the news about the NRA funding the import of illegal gun stocks, illegal ammunition and guns to sell to NRA members  Lol
3380 2018-11-20 00:32:04 Stock exchange is a barometer of Financial and Economic condition of any country... It shows the strength and weakness of any economy... in stock exchange, not only stocks change hands but also financial instruments are traded.
3381 2018-11-20 00:31:36 Bakit may stocks na naman kayo? Haha
3382 2018-11-20 00:31:15 Every Dem needs to start selling off ALL red stocks, starting with Tyson!
3383 2018-11-20 00:30:24 As much as I hate to admit it, I think they were given the killing shove some time in the last decade. Between mismanagement by #DFO of salmon stocks, increased ship traffic through #JuandeFuca & #climatechange, they were doomed long ago.

3384 2018-11-20 00:30:23 Now get back to solving this Trade War before the entire World spins into a depression. Stocks are crashing all over. Is it worth it?
3385 2018-11-20 00:29:35 Growth stocks selling off despite a booming economy and record buybacks on the back of tax cuts tells you how much of their valuation really depends on the lower cost of capital, which is finally materially rising this year.
3386 2018-11-20 00:29:16 If I hadn't had experience trading spec stocks, I wouldn't have cashed out the 3/4. I really didn't want to but I knew the risk and I knew I needed a couple of days offline.
3387 2018-11-20 00:29:09 Investing is all about 30% stocks & 70% psychology. Most focus on the former but actually its the latter that makes you a better investor.
3388 2018-11-20 00:27:13 $NVDA is starting to look like a value stock. Near $120 would be interesting $stocks
3389 2018-11-20 00:26:46 @jimcramer quick question, why must the market revalue all stocks as it anticipates "peak" earnings and "peak" employment?  Can the market be wrong here?  Why can't some beaten down stocks bottom in anticipation of FED blinking or China comprise?
3390 2018-11-20 00:26:45 Even if it is a boundary level scenario there will be too many write ups ,pods and retweets by the laker fan base +PR activity 
I feel Lakers is such a huge fan base that actually improves stocks of a player.
(Eg Mitchell robinson)
And lakers will draft an unheard jewel

3392 2018-11-20 00:25:19 Sooner or later people will realise Bitcoin is not Tech Stocks, or is it related to BCHXYZ.

It’s just Money
3393 2018-11-20 00:24:04 80-90% drop in stocks in real terms. Dollar ends as the global reserve currency, drops 30% almost overnight to begin with. Global forgiveness of sovereign debt or 'jubilee'. The rest is 1929-like effects on the global economy. Potential New World Order led by the IMF.
3394 2018-11-20 00:23:42 Trump has delivered a massive stock bubble and when the buy back stop there is going to be a bigly bang heard round the world. Don’t worry the top 1% that bought on the way up will short the stocks on the way down as Trumpers cheer when they don’t even own stocks.
3395 2018-11-20 00:23:25 I'd love to win the lottery, even just a small one. One million dollars (tax free or after taxes) and I'd be set for life and never have to work for anyone else again. First thing I'd do is set up multiple accounts that generate interest, buy some stocks, and other valuables.
3396 2018-11-20 00:23:14 J'ai ajouté une vidéo à une playlist @YouTube - Evaluation des stocks ( CMUP FIFO LIFO ) Darija cours complet
3397 2018-11-20 00:22:47 Seen a few pivoting from crypto to stocks and forex "make some money where the move and bulls go" lulz.
3398 2018-11-20 00:21:58 I'm impressed that $MLNX has somehow managed to stay above $90 despite the $Nasdaq losing ~ 220 points -- they are outperforming all 3 major indexes #DJI #NASDAQ #SP500 -- I'm interested to see if they continue this trend... #investing #StockMarket #Stocks
3399 2018-11-20 00:21:34 Many funds are at their 12 month lows today. Noting that the dollar is strong but inflation is hitting us, dollar-cost-averaging in may be a decent strategy going forward. I have no faith in tech stocks but plenty of others to bite into right now.
3400 2018-11-20 00:21:11 Hey at least no one’s finding FAANG stocks in their large or mid value investments.  We’ve learned something from 2000 tech wreck, right?
3401 2018-11-20 00:19:56 Also I really hope the korean mart stocks the carbo fire noodles soon because as winter approaches, I want it
3402 2018-11-20 00:19:08 Great segment!  The sad thing is you could add 5 or 6 more things!  Some well known stocks breaking down from 5 to 6 month tops.
3403 2018-11-20 00:18:03 Weed stocks?
3404 2018-11-20 00:18:03 Every NEW TECH reaches market saturation when sales slow &new customers diminish. Overvalued stocks drop to a more reality based level...IMHO
3405 2018-11-20 00:17:32 The ongoing question is to go long or short stocks? Most have enough to learn to trade in one direction. Careful trying to hard. Be focused.
3406 2018-11-20 00:17:12 Currently £1 at B&M for Chicken & Ham or Stewed Beef. Get 'em for your Breshit hoard while stocks last! (Other bargain shops are available)
3407 2018-11-20 00:17:12 @SpencerBoyd are you planning on attending the stocks for tots event in mooresville next month?
3408 2018-11-20 00:17:00 $AAPL and $FB were obvious shorts in the 180s before their ultimate tops. Many like Gundlach were premature in their assessments & calls.  Both stocks had a final thrust to 220-229 to suck in more longs and screw up shorts before the final top. @RedDogT3 @allstarcharts
3409 2018-11-20 00:16:50 because you gave away your stocks so we dont need to see your designs to clone you anymore
3410 2018-11-20 00:15:50 How many times have bump stocks been used in shootings? I can think of 1, but that's the vegas shooting where the FBI has been a total failure in investigating so who knows what is factual there. 

Any others?

3416 2018-11-20 00:11:56 No way my grandmas buying esports public stocks...cannabis maybe (invest in what you know)
3417 2018-11-20 00:11:31 U.S. stocks tumbled on Monday, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial Average shedding about 2 percent and the Nasdaq down more than 3 percent...

Now that's the kind of winning the Trump family is accustomed to!
3418 2018-11-20 00:11:22 Unfortunately, that's retail and the fast food industry for you. Employees are disposable.

There are a few exceptions but all those that are publicly traded are like that.

The image is so important because of the price of the stocks.
3419 2018-11-20 00:10:15 For every pack I buy I always put my money back into the marijuana stocks...
3420 2018-11-20 00:09:34 So if you look at the daily average volume on the daily chart, I don't like trading stocks that are under like several million in a normal day. I believe SPB normally doesnt even get to 500k
3421 2018-11-20 00:09:06 I would say they're more like stocks and it's kinda random which way they go. They only hold steady if you're Mindy St. Claire.

3427 2018-11-20 00:03:34 @StPatrickBridal Hi, do you have a store that stocks all lines of St Patrick- including St Patrick and St Patrick Studio? UK is preferable but I also heard that the flagship store is in Barcelona but can’t find information about this on the internet. Thanks!
3428 2018-11-20 00:03:05 No. Stay patient. Buy stocks at a discount, keep buying, forever...#warrenbuffet style
3429 2018-11-20 00:01:58 One of the most widely owned stocks on the planet and by dinosaurs that don’t even use the platform. The amount of selling that has to be done to unwind the Kong’s is massive.
3430 2018-11-20 00:01:29 It's 2018 and we still can't go to a hospital to receive medical care without the fear of being shot by a gunman we are already being put in jeaproady at school and in malls now hospitals? Really. This is why we need gun control and a ban on bump stocks. #hospital #GunControlNow
3431 2018-11-20 00:00:18 If private insurers wanted to compete they could. Most would fail. Obama threatened to veto public option because he was afraid the stock market would tumble as private insurance companies' crashed. They are MAJOR holders of blue chip stocks and they would have had to sell stocks
