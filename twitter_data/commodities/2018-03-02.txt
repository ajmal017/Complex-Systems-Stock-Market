0 2018-03-03 23:53:55 A 25% tariff will maybe raise domestic prices by around 7.5%. But for commodities like steel, the price is so volatile, it will move more than that for whatever reason over the course of a month.

2 2018-03-03 23:37:13 Do you think the traditional inverse relationship the USD has with commodities will get thrown out the window when this happens? And if so will the correlation change be a lagging indicator or leading indicator confirming the SYSTEM change?

4 2018-03-03 23:34:14 It's sad really. They get cheap contracts from african states to build infrastructures but the quality of their work is questionable. Same to the commodities they ship to Africa..cheap but poor quality. The sad thing is Africa is become more and more determined to trade with them
5 2018-03-03 23:17:26 NAFTA is a multilateral trade agreement not a tariff aimed at particular goods/commodities.
6 2018-03-03 23:10:33 Those industries are dying a natural death as our economy has transitioned.  Other countries are better suited to mfg those commodities.   It has nothing to do with trade imbalance.   If you manipulate the market, the vast majority of Americans will suffer from the retaliation.

11 2018-03-03 22:57:01 You forgot "Consensus algorithms," which is what enables the decentralization; the rest are commodities that support the key piece. "Timestamping" is an oversimplification so it makes sense that your opinions on how *modern* #Blockchain technology works are uninformed.

14 2018-03-03 22:39:34 It’s awful that some people treat cats like tradable commodities
15 2018-03-03 22:29:16 So dont deal with the US. We get fuck all for our commodities from them. We would get more selling to Somalia than Trumps utopia.
16 2018-03-03 22:27:15 I like commodities too, but I don’t think timing is right; long term cyclic lows coming in mid 2020s

18 2018-03-03 22:18:59 Not to mention, in the name of protecting the steel and aluminum industries, now we’ve just jacked up the price of anything that relies on those commodities in this country (new buildings, cars, planes, etc). Considering we’re coming out of a recession that’s not good.

38 2018-03-03 22:08:16 Imposing tariffs on random commodities is a perfectly reasonable response to having your son-in-law investigated for getting foreign money to pay for a building. Isn't it?

42 2018-03-03 21:46:53 I think it’s a lot like what the movie industry is experiencing; most developers only want to “take chances” on sequels or proven commodities. I know the PC/Kickstarter gaming community is pretty solid right now though, although I haven’t played much new this year.
43 2018-03-03 21:46:04 They are commodities nothing more. Can get another one in a bat  of an eye. They served their purpose.
44 2018-03-03 21:27:06 still very hard to sink in that people/ folks tht looked lke endured such indignity.  
Auctioned off like cars/ commodities. Uhm! The word family/ family ties / compassion meant nothing.
45 2018-03-03 21:22:58 Yes this is true.  This is how the world has worked for millennia. Countries trade for resources and commodities they need.  The USA has needs so we import. We also produce in abundance so we export. Are you suggesting isolation? You may want to think of the consequences.
46 2018-03-03 21:21:54 I don't think Kwit understands integrated US/Canada supply chains and the fact that Canada is the main source for most of the primary commodities.
47 2018-03-03 21:17:47 Every woman should be able to make decisions regarding her body, on her own. Access to family planning commodities and services, are key in ensuring that #SheDecides what's best for her. This is a fundamental right.
48 2018-03-03 21:13:38 Carry on from not queuing at banks to withdraw any ammounts of money we want , reasonable prices for commodities etc. What leadership qualities allows Obert mphofu to act in such a manner in an inquiry. Do you think he would behave in such a manner if he was a minister in SA,UK
49 2018-03-03 21:11:02 Abolish drugs from your life and you will feel less dependent on capitalist commodities.
50 2018-03-03 21:10:54 So women are commodities to be paid for? 

Wow!  We learn everyday.
51 2018-03-03 21:10:35 These tariff, trade war talks are just boosting spending in commodities in the US all while inflation is causing the buck to slideeeee
52 2018-03-03 21:02:08 I’m hoping with the new trade negotiations and a weakening dollar, we can create a demand for U.S. commodities. Not sure NAFTA did us any favors in rural America. Hard to know what is going on behind the scenes. Thoughts?
53 2018-03-03 20:58:47 If you don't like paying higher prices for food you didnt seem to mind paying 200% more for everything else over the last 20 years.  Most commodities same price as in late 70's
54 2018-03-03 20:57:40 Game. No doubt about it apart from registered bodies, molecular automobiles, and ideal commodities.
55 2018-03-03 20:56:53 Why should we have a tariff on our commodities (which we already do in most countries) and then import commodities we have a surplus of? Someone has been screwing with US commodities trade for years.  Bout time someone tried to solve it.
56 2018-03-03 20:52:36 Yes, by opposing the Dodd-Franks Act seeking to regulate commodities trade, he has definitely made it easier. Who needs trade/supply chain transparency anyway, huh?

59 2018-03-03 20:43:37 No quieren fabricar ni un alfiler,quedo claro en el mensaje al parlamento,no menciono a la industria,ellos pretenden un país de commodities y servicios,no al desarrollo pleno.lo dijo Churchil (hay que impedir que Argentina se desarrolle)es la misma premisa ,
60 2018-03-03 20:43:18 Inability to deliver commodities to market by rail should not even remotely be a topic of discussion. It's 2018. Lack of leadership, even on the fundamentals.
61 2018-03-03 20:41:55 I disagree. During volitile times the commodities will have better liquidity and less service outages. There is some risk in the crypto pair that isnt as significant as the other pairs
62 2018-03-03 20:33:25 They do it to us all the time in commodities we are finally saying enough we can do it too.
63 2018-03-03 20:33:12 ...to advertise the MAYBACH, let's not forget that. Women really are just commodities, huh WB?

65 2018-03-03 20:16:14 If I never hear the words “big data” again, I’d be very happy. #gross Data should and will be owned by the people it represents. We’re not commodities, we’re people. Hand me another brick... @EthereumDenver #blockchaintechnology #Decentralization
66 2018-03-03 20:06:09 Joe my man, when I checked the commodities markets for steel, copper, wire. China buying 65% with gold. Check where gold price is today. China building their super highways for states outside their capitol plus building the super highways of 6 European countries coming to China.

68 2018-03-03 20:00:36 Yes thank you for thousands of Americans losing their jobs and the increase in the price of commodities for the American consumer! Oh and thanks for shitting on the stock market again!
69 2018-03-03 19:59:24 Women???! Afford???? Are they commodities to be afforded? My niggas go after any class of girl you like. Sex or relationship isn’t/shouldn’t be related to money
70 2018-03-03 19:58:27 Very interesting suggestion. Thoughts on gold, commodities, bonds, USD?
71 2018-03-03 19:42:56 Isn’t it Cool when the leader of the GOP is just spitballing ideas how to take away Constitutional rights and raising taxes on critical commodities.... oh that is so cute
72 2018-03-03 19:41:27 Breadth in bonds and stocks is the best barometer of liquidity, but also the relative performance of commodities and USD ahead of rallies in stocks, and the leadership of speculative indices are all statistical signs of fresh liquidity and risk taking...
73 2018-03-03 19:39:18 In the Middle East, the war is with guns and bombs. In the Capitalist world, the war is with commodities and balance of trade. A destabilizing system has to be created.
74 2018-03-03 19:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
75 2018-03-03 19:36:35 I'm not sure how gold, bonds, commodities, USD and other ccy will be affected. Doesn't a trade war ultimately result in lower growth and deflationary?
76 2018-03-03 19:36:18 And you don't believe that those commodities can be produced anywhere else in the world? One reason they don't is because we produce it so cheaply. When there is suddenly a 20% "tariff" on our exports, there will be others to step in and undercut us.
77 2018-03-03 19:14:00 Is this why they are so against abortion...so they can treat their kids like commodities?
78 2018-03-03 19:07:12 What is “very stupid” is making temperamental and irrational decisions without input from financial and trade EXPERTS.  Stupid is causing costs of commodities like steel to increase, cost to be passed onto American consumers.  Temper tantrum fueled decisions= stupid!!
79 2018-03-03 19:06:48 Volatility creates opportunity, it all depends on your risk tolerance. Straddle some of the ETFs maybe? I don’t deal w/ commodities though. It’s going to get interesting for sure.
80 2018-03-03 18:55:47 I see a currency as commodities
81 2018-03-03 18:52:13 and just how are you supporting American steel by starting a trade war?
You KNOW that Europe and Asia have to respond. IF Europe don't buy enough American commodities it's either because they're too expensive or too low quality.
82 2018-03-03 18:49:14 Good.  You read wikipedia?  All of that is true.  It was also a congressional act applied broadly.  Not targeted to a couple of commodities.
83 2018-03-03 18:48:30 Young people respond much better to HIV and #SRHR services that are specific to their age group. Research shows that targeted counselling to encourage behaviour change among young people is more effective than only handing out commodities such as condoms. #HopeInfantry @ntvkenya
84 2018-03-03 18:41:27 Who do you think that hurts more - countries who can trade more economically with rest of the world or Americans who will lose their jobs and pay more for commodities? #TooStupidForWords
85 2018-03-03 18:38:07 When horses and ponies are commodities sold at 30 euro, and then jettisoned , with no understanding of their sentience, there's a massive cultural problem
86 2018-03-03 18:33:19 I’d be all for it, but most commodities can be traded at other exchanges. NYSE corn would take the place of cbot corn.
87 2018-03-03 18:31:05 This stuff has been going on right under you nose for decades and it never bothered you.  Now you are bothered?  BGH beef in the EU? now GMO commodities?  US beef in Japan?  Monetary Exch policy in China, India and others?  As a group, they are called trade barriers.
88 2018-03-03 18:26:16 Just because you say it is doesn't make it so. Venezuela buys and sells on the world market. Its people work for a wage or salary. It's wealth takes the form of commodities which are sold for profit. That is the capitalist mode of production.
89 2018-03-03 18:12:26 Thinking of repurposing it . If it works for Frac sand it should work for other bulk commodities
90 2018-03-03 18:07:58 Veganism isn't elitist. 

Believing yourself to be so superior to other sentient beings that you feel entitled to treat them as if they were commodities... THAT is elitist.
91 2018-03-03 18:06:20 The energy market isn’t a market. What purpose does it serve? Some people get rich just from buying commodities and billing. I’m really not being political here. Surely it should be renationalised.
92 2018-03-03 18:04:54 Anyone who knows the stock market. Is this a good or bad time to buy commodities? 
93 2018-03-03 18:01:32 What are trump’s bona fides On world economy?  They come from real estate and brand rights.  He has absolutely no background in physical goods, commodities, manufacturing, labor, that suggest he knows how to manage trade in these most important areas.
94 2018-03-03 18:00:00 Another suggestion is to hit their big selling incoming commodities and anything sold at Dollar General Stores Family Dollars Ollie's. Items such as garden hoses that end up in trash after one use across this globe. Trust me on this one We had three per year, due to hard times
95 2018-03-03 17:58:27 Yeap, I understand. I worked for 4 years in a Steel company (Essar) and also had a commercial exp in Iron ore mining deals during 2007-08. Witnessed commodities cycle and lust in the eyes of the participants (iron ore miners) during Euphoria!
96 2018-03-03 17:51:14 I mean I didn't follow stocks and trends and the ebb and flow of general investing in ForEx or any other market for that matter, stocks, precious metals, commodities, bonds... none of it.
97 2018-03-03 17:47:56 Mr President please tell these critics that the free market no longer exists & hasnt for a very long time due to multinational corporations buying up commodities in multiple nations. They control the market the same way opec does with oil!! These people are not living in reality!
98 2018-03-03 17:44:57 So you think we'll gain wealth by paying higher prices for commodities?
99 2018-03-03 17:36:54 Taxing there commodities like they tax us doesn’t seem unreasonable. Or pulling out of an unfair TPP. You hate Trump so much you want our country to fail?
100 2018-03-03 17:34:49 Extreme shortage of cooking gas in #Sanaa .. people queue for long hours in front of gas stations and still get no gas .. millions of Yemenis and non-Yemenis can't afford the continuous increment of gas and commodities prices. #Yemen
101 2018-03-03 17:28:42 Great News!..Now let's do the same for other Ag commodities...feed share program will work for cattle!
102 2018-03-03 17:22:40 The American Way.  "How can I exploit people and their needs to make ?"  People are commodities.
103 2018-03-03 17:19:36 Invest in commodities, Soon as We stop food stamps and give a commodity boxes... Stocks May go up!
104 2018-03-03 17:19:16 Have more  disputes in MQM...
A lesson  for all times to come.Shame on saleable commodities.
105 2018-03-03 17:17:16 So since China is dumping steel globally through many other nations such as Vietnam, thailand... even Canada, what you see by imposing tariffs on dumpoed commodities and steel is just one example, then yes it seems as if it's a trade war, but it's not.
106 2018-03-03 17:15:58 They will eventually make it here so our other industries can have lower input prices and support jobs in other fields.  In this case because of cheap commodities worldwide our auto industries can support more jobs here.Tariffs never lead to more net jobs just more in 1 sector
107 2018-03-03 17:15:38 The gulf between rural and urban has gotten so wide  because producers (and their commodity checkoff $$) have failed to inform non farmers that we sell commodities with prices outside of our control. Many urban dwellers think farming simply involves scooping up free flowing money
108 2018-03-03 17:14:02 I appreciate your worldview but the idea that increasing steel tariffs will support our steel workers is a fallacy proven out just 15 years ago when gwb tried.  When commodities are available at lower cost for whatever reason (lower worker wages in 3rd world countries for example
109 2018-03-03 17:07:31 Commodities...only cheap asset left in the world
110 2018-03-03 16:51:31 That's stupid! I'm a @Dem and I choose American commodities over imports! I'll proudly pay a little more!
111 2018-03-03 16:51:25 I don't know economics on that scale but wouldn't it make sense to have reciprocal tax or tariff rates with each country? Instead of cherry picking a few commodities do it across the board.
112 2018-03-03 16:49:22 #USE @ #Steel&Auminum. THE MARKET isn't what makes America.  workers and  Industry Commodities! #DEMSFORTARIFFS
113 2018-03-03 16:47:17 After this government came into power, the salaries of public servants were increased, the prices of some essential commodities were reduced & the freedom of expression has been restored but you lost the local government election. I see it as a disaster #lka
114 2018-03-03 16:46:46 Unlike myself, my opponent wants an America where greedy doctors and porn stars can make a mockery of our commodities markets. Instead we need to embrace them! #equalityforall
115 2018-03-03 16:40:21 Purple means glamour, status and wealth. It was quite simply one of ancient world most desirable commodities.

117 2018-03-03 16:30:47 There are also those that have control of the world's commodities, but again the average woman on the street isn't party to their machinations.

119 2018-03-03 16:29:56 @eikebatista Na FSP,a Ford disse que as tarifas podem aumentar os preços de commodities no país e prejudicar a competitividade dos fabricantes americanos. O impacto ocorrerá mesmo q a maioria do aço e do alumínio usados nas fábricas dos EUA sejam comprados dentro do próprio país.
120 2018-03-03 16:27:36 Nosso aço ficará 25% + caro nos USA, portanto perderá competitividade.
Muitas outras commodities q exportamos p/ os ianques tb sofrerão taxação.
Será q faremos o msm com td q importamos d lá ou abaixaremos nossos preços, tornando nossos produtos d exportação como bananas ???
121 2018-03-03 16:27:04 Well capital allocation may not be the solution. Few commodities prices are governed by global supply/demand so many a times farmers may end up as losers if there’s no MSP. And in many other rainfed crops , there’s no guarantee of MSP , it is just on paper e.g. cotton .
122 2018-03-03 16:26:57 I'm gonna cry my heart out if ever BTS makes an English cover of all their songs. I mean, the lyrics of their song are just soooo heart pounding. You know. It has depth which I love and necessary commodities I look for. It would attack all of my system srsly. I luv this concept.
123 2018-03-03 16:18:28 Capitalism could very well be the antagonistic system in a cyberpunk setting. Giant megacorporations with immense power that influence everything from healthcare to working rights to the police, that view you as nothing more than capital or commodities
124 2018-03-03 16:16:14 And .. would it mean why the US regulations and legislations' announcements about the US economy are highly considered when analysing and forecasting Global #Oil and #Energy #commodities prices?

the IS should never be dependent on other Countries for commodities as valuable as oil, and steel.
that's the bottom line
128 2018-03-03 16:08:58 Oil is a #1 global commodity, since inflation represents prices of commodities & services, its logical to see a positive correlation

OATCON!!!! 

Although it might be weird having to turn away a bunch of confused Midwesterners every year trying to network with commodities brokers and attend seminars on how to get better market prices on grain
130 2018-03-03 16:04:35 Ah listening and thinking, two very rare commodities these days.
131 2018-03-03 15:56:49 Any politician who makes a statement saying any war is worth it should be removed immediately from office. Human lives are not commodities to be considered in making risky decisions. This is outrageous and dangerous! Perhaps Graham and his family should be on the front line?
132 2018-03-03 15:48:12 I honestly believe, even if they cheat like we know they will at the polls we will still crush the GOP in the coming elections.Even ex- Trumpsters will show up.
This push to replace food stamps with the old boxes of food commodities will be the last nail in the GOP coffin.
133 2018-03-03 15:48:00 I was watching Mickey Mouse with my 3 year old. Asked her if she liked Minnie? She said  "Celebrities are commodities manufactured by institutions"
134 2018-03-03 15:39:55 We don't drink gas. Get your commodities straight genious.
135 2018-03-03 15:38:41 Shouldn't the government also set up plants to transform this raw agrarian produce into lasting commodities for further processing? The entire value chain needs a treatment.
136 2018-03-03 15:38:39 Strikenly,familiar to the world around us take notes to reform your spending habits increase exports to other countries adjust pricing in order too budget commodities, while capping rents rent control price fixing works
137 2018-03-03 15:16:57 Karma! The same resources he wanted to take away from ppl who needs them, he might have to use himself. I guess he’ll get the box of commodities,Trump is talking abt giving ppl who are hungry,so sad. I hope Moore is not allergic to  butter. What goes around, comes back around.
138 2018-03-03 15:15:26 It’s funny when people want their cheap commodities, but they want them made in the USA by Americans on good wages. Let me give you a hint, that ain’t possible. Your cheap stuff is made by people on poor wages in other countries for a reason.
139 2018-03-03 15:12:11 BitNautic acts as a marketplace for goods and commodities where importers, exporters, end-consumer and producers are available to trade their products and ease their trading practices all over the globe #BitNautic #BTNT #ICO #blockchainBitNautic #BitNautic #BTNT #ICO #blockchain
140 2018-03-03 15:11:10 A problem has never been created independently by working Americans that the Government has had to solve. An economic system that treats land, labor and money as commodities instead of as capital, consumes those things that free markets will destroy if no intervention is made.
141 2018-03-03 15:07:54 I don't know why he hasn't faced legal action over RIN market speculation. Not that RINs were even supposed to develop as a commodities market in the first place
142 2018-03-03 15:05:11 I said it long ago & will repeat: Jared Kushner had access for more than a year to one of the most valuable - if not THE most valuable - commodities on the world market: #TopSecret intel. And all the while traveling far & wide seeking investment in his business & properties.
143 2018-03-03 15:01:30 Rare commodities are worth more than good
144 2018-03-03 14:59:34 It’s simple: ‘renting’ a womb means exploiting a woman. Surrogacy makes poor women into gestational commodities. Don’t believe the hype.
145 2018-03-03 14:54:25 if i had commodities worth US$42 million to sent overseas. i will send the avengers to guard them for sure
146 2018-03-03 14:49:28 trade wars often imply global competitive currency devaluation. almost every country needs to print even more fiat, otherwise exports will crash. should be bullish for certain commodities and crypto.
147 2018-03-03 14:44:03 Hey, we really shuld be placing objective tariffs on beer, wine, & liquor too. Other commodities as well. IMO, we'll eventually have to go back to tariffs & worldwide taxation on US income earned offshore -- TO MAGA

Can't do it w/o US mfg which req strong steel & alum industries
148 2018-03-03 14:42:14 I think ppl forget healthcare isn’t like most commodities. Incidence of disease doesn’t really change, but costs of treating does. Esp. as new research & tech becomes available. That system has to be avail for when ppl need to use it. It’s not like u can scale back production

150 2018-03-03 14:19:12 The above books are mostly about oil and commodities ** trading **. If you looking for books about oil industry and market more generally, I will start with @DanielYergin “The Prize”. My colleague @JKempEnergy at Reuters has a very good list of energy books
151 2018-03-03 14:16:15 The fact that we need a consensus opinion is I think the only snag some fans have. Fans want their free agents to be proven commodities (ex: pro bowl, all pro) but hopefully he makes Ireland & Loomis continue to look like geniuses.
152 2018-03-03 14:15:02 Another "commission" is not what is needed. The practice by China of disrupting world commodities such as steel is an old and well known practice. China does not have to abide by international trade laws in free markets. China must be forced to put prices on their exports.
153 2018-03-03 14:14:49 Value is not something you can easily measure using an equation, it's purely perceptional. The value of "real" commodities can also be exaggerated by perception (e.g. diamonds, baseball cards).

155 2018-03-03 14:12:55 One of the four freedoms. The other 3 always ignored. Designed simply for the benefit of capital. Only one that ever gets talked of as having restrictions. People are just commodities tonuae as required who would have thought Green Party so in favour of rule by corporations
156 2018-03-03 13:53:26 Real commodities aren't digitally printed out of thin air instamined by developers trying to fool the world to accept it as money.
157 2018-03-03 13:41:29 Being able to sell commodities above their value is the exception not the rule.
The majority of chair produces would sell the chair at its value and make profit from giving the workers less.
What incentive does a capitalist have to give workers more than the absolute minimum?
158 2018-03-03 13:40:35 And the desire to be normalized. To fit in. To have the "good life." But at the kids' expenses. They are now commodities to be purchased. It will be at a steep price.
159 2018-03-03 13:37:44 Completely disagree it’s impossible in commodities such as steel and aluminum. Processing the ores is capital and labor intensive. The capacity to do this cannot come on overnight in response to rent-seeking by a monopolistic, who will just dump again to destroy the new capacity.

164 2018-03-03 13:15:01 It matters if you are selling/marketing the ICO to US investors and if you call ICOs "Currency", "Commodities" or "Securities". There is a battle on definitions underpinning all of this. If you market the coin to US investors, the SEC can step in under "investor protection".

170 2018-03-03 12:08:06 Si tuviéramos una política de I+D como Brasil, podríamos diseñar y fabricar alguna autoparte nueva, muchas autopartes son commodities. Brasil hace que las montadoras inviertan un % en I+D local. Así surgen el Duna, el Suran y otros injertos a la brasileña.
171 2018-03-03 11:59:19 Let's just say I'm glad there's no major global commodities trade in sulphur/sulfur
172 2018-03-03 11:51:54 And it all got washed away with higher gas prices, commodities. higher food and other prices as well. Nothing but a smoke screen. You people got nothing and it will go away in 2 years. How does that make you feel?
173 2018-03-03 11:50:57 Apparently crypto commodities will be widely accepted,however it must be borne in mind that hard cash will not be eliminated in anytime soon as some trivial transactions are inaccessible using these digital currencies.
174 2018-03-03 11:50:06 People having to use food banks is a disgrace and most users are genuine, but they are SOME who are using them as a result of prioritiesing other commodities
175 2018-03-03 11:43:15 Some would say that psychotherapy is 'a practice', not 'a job'; & the most honourable psychotherapists would not choose to delegate to an institution their own personal responsibility to uphold the Ethics of this practice for the sake of whatever commodities a 'job' may offer.

186 2018-03-03 10:43:59 I think not easy practice unfair trade on commodities like steel and aluminium
187 2018-03-03 10:40:34 Would be a really bad time to start a global trade / tariff war in commodities, wouldn't it?  Especially given the countries the US gets its U from.

190 2018-03-03 10:20:26 Food Banks shouldn't be a thing 21st century Britain but in some cases people are using them due to prioritising other commodities, I know many who use food banks but still manage a holiday? I was poor as anyone but got my priories right and never needed food banks
191 2018-03-03 10:15:31 By virtue of abundance it is: replicators allow anyone to have anything at no cost. There is no "original" nor "single" item, and beside some rare commodities in the series, you lack nothing and hoarding anything is pointless (because everybody can have the same)

193 2018-03-03 09:59:05 Given patience & timing are unfortunately often such rare commodities; prioritising players who are familiar with the level, or a comparable level, is often the outcome as they represent the best chance of getting “quick wins” that give you more time

But yes, as a general rule if they want to dump on us... thanks. If they wish to cartelise and withhold supply lie Opec, no.

199 2018-03-03 09:02:26 Hasn't India done same thing by imposing minimum import prices? Not only in steel & aluminium but other commodities as well? Metal stocks started doing well on higher prices. Consumer's cost artificially increased. Govt should think of ways to lower commodity production cost.
200 2018-03-03 08:47:41 But when we start putting tariffs on unfinished goods and commodities, well, that has a negative effect on manufacturing here at home and drives prices for finished goods up.

203 2018-03-03 08:27:54 Sir... This is not always true especially with respect to price. In Nigeria, most of locally produced food commodities are more expensive because we've not taken advantage of economies of scale, infrastructural deficit which has reduced our comparative advantage.

248 2018-03-03 03:08:50 Hatred and bigotry. You created a family. Are your kids or pets as you call them commodities? If so, what is their value?
249 2018-03-03 02:53:23 Hey Brent, I don't know if this USD short squeeze will happen soon or after other currencies and possibly gold break out of their patterns.  What I do know is we're due for consolidation in USD and UST and commodities will likely outperform stocks LT.

251 2018-03-03 02:49:14 You can’t measure it by size of trade deficit alone. The US exports e.g. a ton of agricultural commodities to all those countries. If they stop buying our beef, wheat, dairy, etc. it will hurt us. They can also decide not to respect IP on stuff like pharmaceuticals and software.
252 2018-03-03 02:33:58 Monetary policy.  Amazing how it is said that the global economy is experiencing “synchronized growth”, yet commodities are cheaper than either bubble... which were during stagnant global situations.
253 2018-03-03 02:32:57 Industrial high yield and oil high yield is at big risk as hedge funds unwind this massive year build up to over 90% net long.  We’ve only started week 4 of the great unwind.  Post QE economy, too much capital flowing into commodities on supply side. Deflation returning.
254 2018-03-03 02:26:55 Gross how y’all treat other people, like their commodities
255 2018-03-03 02:26:36 Really? Back to that again are we? I remember in '07 around $CRB peak, and the 1000th time I heard the line “they are building a new NY city in China every year!” usually from fund wholesalers, …then it was over for commodities….Are we back to China buying everything forever?
256 2018-03-03 02:19:14 I think that's possible. Complete, scoring PGs are valuable commodities. So one hand I can see it, but also can't help feeling he's maybe a notch below. Not a terrible thing, btw, as it increases the chance of ending up in a more stable situation.

Put FairnessDoctrine back, limit propaganda
258 2018-03-03 02:12:09 Este governo que eis gerindo o pais tem de torcer muito para que as commodities voltem a subir novamente. Somente assim o país voltará a crescer como na era Lula. Caso contrário a economia brasileira vai patinar.
259 2018-03-03 02:09:13 Temos uma economia cambaleante. Uma economia dependente do bom humor das commodities no mercado internacional. Lula se deu bem porque surfou no preço das commodities de 2003 até meados de 2013.

262 2018-03-03 01:45:27 That's localized shortages of specific types of sand. Sand is like snow there are as many types as you can imagine words to describe. All commodities at things people kill over. There are many places you can lose your live over the load in a honey wagon.
263 2018-03-03 01:36:28 Only recently has anything about the Stock Market had anything to do with Trump. There are so many other factors World wide. But the tariff thing on steel and aluminum did drop it 500 points like a rock. Commodities 101.
264 2018-03-03 01:32:29 I agree that we can not depend on consumerism, but I don't think placing tariffs on commodities is the answer. There are a lot of other solutions that would allow us to continue to be producers, innovative, and competitive in the global market.
265 2018-03-03 01:15:06 This isn't the 1940's. Coal, oil, and steel are not the future, they're legacy in search of a better purpose. Force-feeding commodities to America doesn't change their underlying value, just their monetary worth. I know, big words... Here: We're going to pay more for everything!
266 2018-03-03 01:08:39 Now I'm no expert, but the consumer is at the mercy of the market. And if certain commodities are not getting to market because of your trade ban, prices on those commodities will go up. Hence you screwed us again, Trumpy.
267 2018-03-03 01:03:36 I'm a leftist that is sick of the corporations and the government abusing it's people and treating it's work force like commodities. We must not surrender any of our arms of give the state a way in. The second we make it easier to label peoppe "Ill fit" ...
268 2018-03-03 01:02:12 As I said before David Brooks and his friend Mark Shields are dated commodities at PBS. You guys need to update this segment. Both of these guys are clueless. Look for younger and more talented commentators. Thank you.
269 2018-03-03 00:55:08 Does it ever occur to anyone to ask why climate change sceptics are apparently entirely unsceptical of why their ideas are funded & promoted by those who benefit financially from the obscene profits of trading in the commodities & processes driving that change?

271 2018-03-03 00:47:15 You're wrong. Tariffs are to put end to dumping commodities / products on the world, and creating a huge supply disadvantage.  It's a way to balance trade in our favor to control some of the supply side of economics, and stop giving it away. Not protectionism or anti trade. Smart
272 2018-03-03 00:37:50 Agreed, we have to protect our children who are our most precious commodities.

274 2018-03-03 00:24:37 Even though we have ample supplies, Ag commodities are I n a state of equilibrium, the world needs Ag commodities. You will go to where the supplies are, I.e. The US.
275 2018-03-03 00:22:38 You are willing to sell "their" schools to the highest bidder. How dare you feign concern for America's public school students. To you and your ilk, they are commodities to be bought and sold.
276 2018-03-03 00:18:17 Women like men are mammals. Most female mammals use a uterus in the same why as humans, which is why pigs are often studied in relation to human health. Your projection of women a commodities is a display of your lack of knowledge on science 
277 2018-03-03 00:17:16 It had the feel of the Duke brothers explaining commodities to Billy Ray Valentine.
278 2018-03-03 00:11:25 It got out of the labor intensive ag commodities in the 50s and 60s. It's still not close to 1st world. GDP/capita today is ~$8-10k. It'll take another century to get Brazil to first world status IMO.
279 2018-03-03 00:10:14 yes; it took Brazil a long time because the gap was originally so large. it was a poor labor-intensive agricultural commodities exporter prior to its various policies to promote industrialization (especially in the 1960s-1970s).

322 2018-03-04 21:09:00 My point - if you don’t trade, your bankrupt (my original tweet).  The US must export commodities, if not, the US price for I.e corn drops dramatically (almost 15% of US corn is exported).  This policy can bankrupt your food supply/security (in this realistic example)
323 2018-03-04 21:08:22 yeah that's dumb tbh, but i guess a weird side-effect of the marketisation of the academy? If someone tells you you're producing commodities enough it makes sense to think of yourself as a worker in some sense

327 2018-03-04 20:51:55 That may well happen and cause the IMF to start focusing on a more balanced SDR reserve currency program.  If that's the case, why wouldn't you want commodities and front run what you know will happen from the CBs to create hyperinflation? I would think USD up, commodities up,
328 2018-03-04 20:47:17 The more I learn about economics and business, the more I learn that cash ain’t shit. Land and commodities is the real deal.

If I want to repeal the second amendment, I may still want guns to be purchasable as commodities--take cars, for instance. Perfectly consistent beliefs.

337 2018-03-04 19:34:57 There's a very basic example of a 2 commodity / 2 person economic system where 1 person is better at producing both commodities. Optimum production still relies on trade and both sides are worse off without trade.

353 2018-03-04 18:04:44 These tariffs are no more than market manipulation by affecting the prices of commodities. It's no different than holding raw materials on a barge off the coast until the price rises to gain the most amount of profit. These increase in prices will affect the customers directly.

368 2018-03-04 17:11:10 I am SO ready for commodities to spring out of the gate.
369 2018-03-04 17:05:42 "2018 is the year growth is believed. Investors will rotate into commodities for profit and diversification," says @miningmavengwen
370 2018-03-04 17:05:26 What factors are driving commodities? Global economic growth is one, says @miningmavengwen - this is a powerful force #PDAC2018 #INNatPDAC
371 2018-03-04 17:04:41 Very true. Lenders used balloon payments, etc. to assist people to buy homes they could not afford. Wall Street pushed to bundle these risky loans & sell like commodities. Wall Street executive were never even charged with any fraud. Money talks.
372 2018-03-04 17:03:16 Water recycling and desalinization would help more, but there’s more $$$ in turning vital resources into commodities I guess.
373 2018-03-04 17:01:38 Against rising of Petrol,Diesel,LPG and other essential commodities prices,the @INCDelhi is organising 280Demonstrations all over Delhi The people of Delhi,with enthusiasm,supported the Congress party and lit the effigy of Modi+ Kejriwal and made the program successful @ajaymaken
374 2018-03-04 16:49:47 Inflation is a monetary phenomenon. Cons. goods price inflation follows monetary inflation. Monetary inflation has been temporarily parked in the bond market and will move rapidly into cons. good and commodities.
375 2018-03-04 16:45:12 Charles, three words:  Border Adjustment Tax.  I would rather use this than nickel and dimes through tariffs on select commodities.  Pay down debt with a BAT like most other countries do.
376 2018-03-04 16:37:28 Why you, as an African, blame (for what?), as prime reason, population explosion in #Africa, in the face of European xenophobia? #poorgovernance, western driven
#unfairglobalisation, climatechange, high lifestyle #GHG emissions/env. footprint, resources +commodities capture etc
377 2018-03-04 16:37:25 You had the commodities cycle in CAN and AUS on top of wordwide QE credit cycle. house prices are bad anywhere. People cannot afford them. Couple in the 30s moving back with parents and cut spending to save for a deposit (great deflationary thing to do, Mr Draghi!)
378 2018-03-04 16:35:50 As for dalio’s all-weather portfolio, I don’t know about the merits
of the 55 percent bond allocation or the 7.5 percent gold allocation.  Ok with the minimum 30% equity allocation and 7.5% commodities allocation.
379 2018-03-04 16:27:11 You're missing the point that  U.K. exported products are not only commodities but processed goods too. This adds value and creates jobs too, win/ win is it not?
380 2018-03-04 16:25:49 @_Andrew_Walter you are right. All asset classes are inflated to an all time high level. Only commodities are lagging behind. As a coincidence, what politicians call inflation is exactly that - rising commodity prices. The trend has started, give it a few years to develop...
381 2018-03-04 16:24:15 You don't mention our (US) high tariffs on tobacco, peanuts and other many other commodities. The cars do not freely pour in but that is one example of uneven tariff.
382 2018-03-04 16:11:01 Think of your Iphone. Manufactured in China.
It doesnt have all commodities to assemble iphone but it does have FTA with commodity rich countries. This give China all the access to those commodities. 

Cheap commodity + cheap labor : cheaper iphone.

Cheaper iphone : good
383 2018-03-04 16:07:15 Should Indian MLAs be listed as tradable commodities on NSE and BSE ? RT if u agree
384 2018-03-04 16:07:02 Good for electric car boom.  After #Oil, another example to show physical commodities can easily be reproduced at higher prices.  Value addition lies in productization and technology
385 2018-03-04 16:00:20 Tariffs on fundamental industrial commodities like aluminum & steel are not offensive trade tactics, they're a means of protecting domestic industies & related trades. In other words, they're not intended to punishŶretaliate against other nations, but protect US industries & jobs

388 2018-03-04 15:55:07 People are not commodities.
389 2018-03-04 15:55:05 This fool doesn't understand how an economy keeps commodities affordable and inflation in check. He railed against the very unfair Japanese in the eighties. He can't see the follow though. Japan struggling with stagflation. US growing steadily, in spite of trade deficit.
390 2018-03-04 15:52:40 Adoption is not what creates price stability. Only one thing creates price stability, and that's flat supply / demand. Most commodities are "widely adopted" but have fluctuations in supply or demand. Even if Bitcoin is widely adopted, we would expect demand to fluctuate
391 2018-03-04 15:41:04 What's forgotten is that, during every recession (which are cyclical in capitalist economies), the government and the BoE is tasked with sorting out the private sector. A socialist idea by nature.

And before anyone starts being derogatory, I'm a commodities trader 
392 2018-03-04 15:34:02 I think these storms bring out the worst in people or well showcase how pathetic they can be.

Just because we have commodities does not mean we are entitled to them or need them to survive (1)
393 2018-03-04 15:19:34 WHAT A DISPLAY OF SUBTLE OBJECTIFICATION OF WOMEN. 

you’re feeding into the stigma that women should be seen as commodities na yung suot nila is a representative of their value as individuals.
394 2018-03-04 15:11:21 There will be no price impact to Americans with the Presidents tariffs. Peter Navarro is correct. Everyone is forgetting about the new corporate tax rate. Aluminum prices are commodities based on global LME pricing. Competition now has an even playing field with these tariffs.
395 2018-03-04 15:08:15 O corte no orçamento para Ciência é um problema profundo que compromete o desenvolvimento de diversos países. O Brasil, como bom vendedor de commodities que é, não deveria focar suas políticas exclusivamente em exportações.

401 2018-03-04 14:05:07 3192: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
402 2018-03-04 13:53:33 We actually don't want to be men actually.

We just want to be free to be ourselves, not commodities to be auctioned or pressured into doing stuff we don't want to do.
I love being married and being a mom. I also love having a career, a business and pursuing whatever interests me
403 2018-03-04 13:53:27 So let me get this straight.... the tariff on steel and aluminum should make farm equipment more expensive, the price of ag commodities cheaper, and our government is mainly worried about rural broadband. That should help the rural areas quite a bit. #redstates
404 2018-03-04 13:52:28 DO YOU INVEST IN: Bonds (Government/Corporate etc), Equities (Large Cap, Small Cap, Developed Markets, Emerging Markets etc), Physical Metals (Gold etc), Commodities (Oil etc), Property (USA, Japan etc), or just hold cash?

408 2018-03-04 13:24:19 This country exports 2 things. Intellectual property and ag commodities. The last 2 decades the rest of the world has stolen both. I get a chuckle out of folks that say we are in a trade war now.  We have been in a trade war for decades. We finally decided to start fighting back.
409 2018-03-04 13:19:31 Stoic wisdom and altruism are rare commodities these days. We are mostly deeply rooted on social vices and bereft of positive values. These, unfortunately, are a reflection of what our society has become. Decay!
410 2018-03-04 13:05:43 If a fall in the price of oil can lead to shortages of food, medicine and other basic commodities such as toilet paper, then there is something inherently wrong with the economic system
411 2018-03-04 13:03:38 No, it's the whole economic system based around the purchase and sale of commodities that are by default the property of a privileged minority who own the means of production that's the problem.
412 2018-03-04 12:51:54 Don't apply Tariffs on products or commodities. No maker of these applies tariffs on our stuff. Apply the Tariffs only on the countries that tax our stuff unfairly. Tax Chinese Aluminum, nut Canadian Aluminum. Or are just doing this for your cronies in the Steel & AL industries?
413 2018-03-04 12:07:14 Read up about what Alan Greenspan said about Enron. He literally told Brooksley Born, chair of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission that he thought it unnecessary to prosecute fraud.
414 2018-03-04 11:46:15 There's nothing about it that is a buzzword. Gramm-Leach-Billy,  Commodities Futures modernization act, telecommunications act of 96, NAFTA, charter schools,  are all very real neoliberal policies,  that had ver real impacts.  All of those policies have been championed by Hillary

Should Indian MLAs and MPs be listed as tradeable commodities on MCX? 
417 2018-03-04 11:39:55 It wasn't. It was far more disturbing than race. People viewed other people solely as commodities. Nothing more. 

Do you seriously think that a slave owner, offered white slaves for half the price of black ones, would refuse to purchase because they weren't black?

He somehow keeps an open mind.

424 2018-03-04 10:55:52 @aelfblockchain In arbitrage-free markets, always insulate uncovered commodities.
425 2018-03-04 10:51:49 OTC reference entities: in the commodities sector, never cover them.
426 2018-03-04 10:49:28 JIT is tough when loop is weeks, but we cope. Tier 1 win same vehicle in 2-3 regions, but OEMs dislike qualifying  components from different Tier 2/3 suppliers. Decisions are made on best supplier globally particularly for raw commodities used across multiple platforms.
427 2018-03-04 10:43:55 @aelfblockchain In the commodities sector, be sure to leverage pro rata CDOs.
428 2018-03-04 10:31:35 but what changed in the 1970s was the expectations re social spending, as well as increased public investment (subsidies to public sector enterprises) in order to maintain or increase employment levels. this, along with the commodities boom in the 1970s, encouraged external debt
429 2018-03-04 10:28:18 @Jenni_Fagan Thank you for your poignant reminder of power and abuse of storytelling esp how our ’care’ system treats vulnerable children & young people in care as commodities, ’shifted ’from place to place with no care of who they uniquely are or could become! @rickyaross

437 2018-03-04 09:40:45 Simple minded thinking. Unfortunately common among those who benefit the most. We produce far more food, wool, wood, iron ore, and numerous other commodities than we can consume ourselves. How do we increase our nation’s wealth if we can’t access markets to trade? It’s a win win.

474 2018-03-04 06:29:15 Agreed that most things will be tokenized, but some as commodities, like real estate, which often is not considered a security. Or do you see all tokens as a security?
475 2018-03-04 06:27:34 A good idea in principle but it can only work for a few places. Towns stay small because they cannot produce enough commodities to drive growth. Usually their production is limited by a finite quantity of regional resources, not a labor shortage.

507 2018-03-04 04:21:56 The protocols and exchanges will become commodities. The early winners will create value but the moats will melt away over time
508 2018-03-04 04:07:57 We go with the known commodities Zeke and Diggs. That 19 1st likely ends up as a late pick and if you want a 19 1st you have time to require one
509 2018-03-04 03:47:58 Some commodities are cheaper to produce elsewhere and import. A tariff on cheap Canada Al will drive up the price of imported Al, but it won't make US Al any less expensive,  US Al will be cheaper than imported, but it will still be more expensive.  US industry and consumers pay
510 2018-03-04 03:38:14 Open air silver bars hundreds of bars, but we say drop the price to “bankrupt” levels and we can see what world peace is made of sad sad  commodities wars are no shit what we have lived to witness we love the fact our money is becoming worth more than euros and gbp america cash
511 2018-03-04 03:37:57 Capitalism makes anything expensive though in a sense? Since its cornerstone is putting monetary value in commodities?

513 2018-03-04 03:34:20 Like I said, foolish to waive a veteran goaltender in the middle of a playoff race and depend on more unproven commodities (that was also not producing good numbers in AHL).
514 2018-03-04 03:33:12 So much fun reading these comments. Are you China’s puppets? They’ve been dumping commodities like steel for decades and have big tariffs on our products. Your “trade war” started decades ago. Both Dems and Republican globalists have ripped the middle class to shreds
515 2018-03-04 03:30:19 Today Delhi Cong under the leadership of Ajay Makan ji  is doing block wise protest/ demonstration on price hike on essential commodities petrol diesel LPG against Modi & Kejriwal govt @INCIndia @INCDelhi
516 2018-03-04 03:27:49 Raoul, we need to talk.  I would love to record a conversation about commodities and the dollar.  I hope all is well!
517 2018-03-04 03:20:23 i mean that’s already happening with cryptokitties and other digital commodities on the blockchain so
518 2018-03-04 03:18:13 I travel all over the world and you’re correct. An American car is very rarely seen, or many other commodities for that matter. This tells me our current trade agreements aren’t good for America and also we Americans can do just fine without trade with foreign countries.
519 2018-03-04 03:13:30 Commodities?
520 2018-03-04 03:09:39 Against rising of Petrol, Diesel, Kerosine, LPG and other essential commodities prices, the @INCDelhi is organising 280 Demonstrations all over Delhi,Today on 4 March ,pls participate everyone in Large Num@Sharmistha_GK @ajaymaken @OfficeOfRG @sushmitadevmp @dnetta
521 2018-03-04 03:04:41 And that’s US equities which face the biggest threat. Active bonds, commodities, asset allocation, non-US, etc... much better prospects IMO.
522 2018-03-04 03:01:29 Farmers have been buttonholing @SecretarySonny at a commodities conference in CA, hoping he might persuade Trump to change course. 

They - and EVERY SINGLE OTHER PERSON BUT TRUMP - know that a trade war will not be 'easy to win.' 

Trump's hellbent on starting one war or another
523 2018-03-04 02:58:48 Hard to believe you are actually employed by @alvarezmarsal Not a good look that one of their employees is essentially running an elaborate pump and dump imo. May no be illegal since these coins are technically not listed commodities but grey area @PaulAversano
#fraud
524 2018-03-04 02:47:03 What does POLY actually do? From my understanding it’s used to pay for the KYC/AML. Why use that when there will be tons of other platforms with security tokens. They will all be commodities.
525 2018-03-04 02:28:40 I don't know what development people of NE seen in last 4 years. The main development I can see is people are loosing job price of commodities are increasing but even then BJP is wining the reason may be the opposition does not have a solid strategy.
526 2018-03-04 02:25:27 I don’t scan for stocks per say. I built a list of stocks in play based on news, offshore comps, ETF movements, commodities etc. and then I monitor them all day!
527 2018-03-04 02:19:46 Lol, reminds me of the space shuttle outrage of another decade. I  quit buying ammunition when it hit .24 cents a round. If you choise to investigate further, you'll find less manufacturers,  and metal commodities behind it, similar to Trump's  outrage over metals. Costs go up,
528 2018-03-04 02:04:38 As for AVZ a great trading stock -no question -but like iron ore -coal and many other commodities in war torn countries or countries with high sovereign risk it wont see the light of day.
529 2018-03-04 02:00:55 Yeah opportunity to overwork Halak and depend on more unproven commodities in the middle of a playoff hunt is a smart idea.
530 2018-03-04 02:00:12 Any nation that has the means to be self sufficient using it’s own resources and chooses to farm out the production of its most important secondary commodities to other countries does so at the expense of national security and the enrichment of persons with very narrow interests.
531 2018-03-04 01:41:19 When you vote for someone, doesn’t mean you believe in everything they do.  I don’t know enough about tariffs but why is it considered free trade when the free part only applies to commodities coming into the US? Yet we should pay taxes for our exports.
532 2018-03-04 01:34:46 I agree but what about different utility currencies for different commodities the eg in the podcast is solar energy. I thinknthe concept has merit for a new type of economy. Imagination needed.
533 2018-03-04 01:31:02 If I wanted to save money on commodities I'd use my NRA membership.
534 2018-03-04 01:11:09 Is it possible that China might offer concessions on its tariffs?  We just need something done about the one-way trade with a number of countries.  Trade is good, unless it creates dependency for critical commodities or weakens currencies.
535 2018-03-04 00:55:48 Those girls are commodities to these people, something to be bought and sold, enslaved to the men to pump out white babies for them, to increase their numbers.
536 2018-03-04 00:52:36 Today's Corn (ZC) futures prices, Corn futures, Corn commodities, charts and quotes.
537 2018-03-04 00:50:39 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
538 2018-03-04 00:46:06 S1x03, Commodities. 
539 2018-03-04 00:44:41 The real problem is speciesism and how it make people think they have the right to own another sentient being. Treating others like commodities is called slavery. Go vegan.
540 2018-03-04 00:40:15 If something is too good to be true, it's probably a fraud. Like the guy who wrote the article I posted I've worked in financial services all my life. I've been involved in insurance, trading, lending, commodities, risk, compliance, legal. I know it's bollocks.
541 2018-03-04 00:34:13 #notariffs. Meanwhile, I am pretty sure that sooner or later Trump will be found guilty of some sort of corruption scandal. Meanwhile, please keep him from destroying our democracy. Do what you can to restrict his ability to levy tariffs on commodities. Thanks -
542 2018-03-04 00:32:29 I suspect when the high prices for basic commodities hit the population from inexperienced Trump's "Trade war" the desperately poor will rise up against the gold plated Toilet protectors and 2A is for that 
543 2018-03-04 00:25:43 Ppl don't want a hand out, they want fair & equal opportunities 2 pave their own way, 2 buy their own groceries & 2 afford the basic commodities 2 live. 
4 @SpeakerRyan 2 hav been provided those vry things & 2 turn his back now whn given chance 2 pay it back is despicable
544 2018-03-04 00:23:39 Steel like other commodities comes in various qualities, etc that meet specific needs for some industries and not for others. Fine. America decides to use only its own steel. Any  idea what happens next?
545 2018-03-04 00:21:24 So all countries want to pay ‘no’ taxes for their commodities coming into the US, but want us to pay exorbitant taxes for our exports?  Hummmm?  Makes sense. Ridiculous. Because you got away with it for so long, you should feel lucky.
546 2018-03-04 00:17:53 Good idea. 
Since the selling point of plastic is its sturdiness and durability it would behoove us to apply it to things we want to keep as long as possible rather than 'toss-away' commodities.
547 2018-03-04 00:12:55 Much potential for profit-taking by insider trading as well, because of alteration of tariffs and effects on various industries that rely on the tariffed commodities.
548 2018-03-04 00:07:55 No it can't. Global businesses trade in multiple currencies. They like dollars, pounds and euros precisely because they're stable currencies that don't get spammed. But they'll trade in whatever currency they feel is best or trade in commodities if necessary. Govts don't have 1/2

550 2018-03-04 00:00:10 Hoarding
Rapid increases in prices can sometimes result in hoarding of basic commodities. This is sometimes due 2 fear of price increases, but is sometimes due to speculators who buy large quantities of basic commodities with the expectation that they will rise in price & value.

584 2018-03-02 22:48:57 If we do not turn the table the national debt has no chance to go down.  We’ve dug a huge hole as a consumer only driven economy, we must start producing products and commodities again

588 2018-03-02 22:32:57 Of course, but a sentient creature's interest in remaining alive and being safe from danger and predators is still fundamental. And yes, my evil, self-serving agenda of getting people to see cows as individuals with lives of their own, rather than commodities and production units
589 2018-03-02 22:29:06 About steel , I know that’s a part of the steel industry, yet we are talking about steel beams , plates etc as well.  Yes I need those commodities to fabricate and American made is far superior
590 2018-03-02 22:26:09 Think... he  places tariffs on steel and aluminum...won't that adversely affect the prices of everything associated with these commodities and then everything associated those commodities affected? This is how inflation works.
591 2018-03-02 22:16:06 Ben Stein is spot on IMO telling @LizMacDonaldFOX that trade wars and protectionism are bad for economies, but metals and other commodities with military significance are exceptions in a world where we have been weakened for a decade & need to reset.

598 2018-03-02 21:28:28 His actions pit American companies that use steel and aluminum against American companies that make those commodities. Consumers lose. Workers lose. Oligarchs win...
599 2018-03-02 21:25:55 How do you get “You think people are commodities!” from me saying “I don’t think people are commodities”?
600 2018-03-02 21:21:43 @AQRCapital Hats off - simple and honest: "Commodities do not have obvious yield measures, and we find no statistically significant predictability in medium-term returns. Our estimate of [...] expected return is therefore simply the long-run average return."
601 2018-03-02 21:18:22 Oh.., by the way... In case folks are misled... Business is business. Called maximum profit. Business and industry will buy from the ones charging lowest price for their materials or commodities. Don't blame them. Our country kind of screwed ourselfs on this one over decades.
602 2018-03-02 21:17:50 This especially applies to tariffs on commodities like steel, rubber & plastics, glass, and aluminum which are fundamental materials used by ALL US manufacterers.
603 2018-03-02 21:15:42 Eu queria que me explicassem o que o petróleo tem de mais estratégico que outras fontes de energia ou outras commodities cujas produtoras ja foram privatizadas. Tudo o que é estratégico para políticos tradicionais, é contrário ao interesse do brasileiro.

605 2018-03-02 21:09:17 Exactly, these aren't non-essential commodities we can allow other nations to become dominant in.  These are vital resources to a country's stability and defense.

609 2018-03-02 20:44:18 If it is “trivial” then why the tariffs? Tell the companies to get more efficient to compete or get out of business. China has figured out, it is more profitable to go direct to source for raw materials than to play the US Commodities Market. Middle man siphon money out economy.

617 2018-03-02 20:23:11 This has concerned me for a long time.  I have always had the suspicion that if we got into it with China they would likely stop selling us steel to make our weapons.

Steel as well as other commodities are essential for national defense and for a thriving economy when at peace.
618 2018-03-02 20:22:23 A me sembra un assioma gettato a fine paper senza alcuna dimostrazione.
Ad esempio parla di "asset woul lose value"
Parliamo di asset reali? Commodities come stabilimenti immobili etc.? Lose value solo rispetto all'estero. Per italiano residente ita non cambia
619 2018-03-02 20:18:47 Do you support China’s border tax? What’s your solution to deal with balance of payments. Do you understand what commodities are strategic resources? 

Making this about the price of steel is myopic economics.
620 2018-03-02 20:09:25 It's not a question of money anymore. It's a national defense issue. America cannot depend on foreign countries for aluminum and steel. They are commodities. I don't want to bankroll them like ethanol but we have to make it economically ourselves.
621 2018-03-02 20:05:28 That may be true for commodities but, you can buy technology cheaper today and some that did not even exist in 1989.
622 2018-03-02 19:58:38 You MORON. 1) Trade wars are not easy to win, 2) trade wars trigger higher prices that we have to pay for any product using the commodities you stuck your idiotic tariffs on, and 3) tariffs can trigger or worsen economic depressions like Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression.
623 2018-03-02 19:58:31 I think this time is different. We don’t need to South’s commodities.
624 2018-03-02 19:47:09 This week in the March 2 RL: Price increases of engineered wood haven't kept pace with commodities. B.C. has another bug problem - spruce beetles.
625 2018-03-02 19:40:30 we are not commodities. we are not transactions. we are human beings.
626 2018-03-02 19:40:11 You know, Charles, it all depends on whether we can make the product here. With steel and aluminum, the effects will be minimal because they are commodities and the US price will be roughly comparable. With white goods, we may have to pay more.
627 2018-03-02 19:38:59 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.
628 2018-03-02 19:36:43 Imports and exports are policy positions on product costs and labor preferences. The direction of the flows aren't about winning or losing. We buy commodities from China because it's cheaper. Smart people would apply the offset labor elsewhere. We aren't.

630 2018-03-02 19:34:28 It's actually quite straight forward.  Starting from 2000's to up until now between 1 trillion to trillion and a half dollars disappeared in the offshores from oil, gas and other commodities sales... Do you think that they would make a nuclear dust from their life work?
631 2018-03-02 19:29:34 That's true for many commodities. There are more people in industries that use petroleum than in industries that PRODUCE it. But we must take a strong stand with foreign suppliers of basic commodities.

646 2018-03-02 18:46:55 The @GrantsPub interview with Leigh Goehring re commodities on @realvision was insightful and thought provoking.  I agree with his view on offshore drillers & #ag.  If you have a subscription I'd highly advise taking the time to watch it.
647 2018-03-02 18:41:36 @realDonaldTrump is doing the right thing by letting NAFTA fail. It will keep other countries from hoarding metals/commodities in other countries and using NAFTA to funnel them through to the US. You don’t think China is currently a huge threat to our metals market? Think again.
648 2018-03-02 18:41:20 @DeanBaker13 For us noobs, what would be the effects of a tariff for the US economy? Prices? World trade? Commodities? Worldwide shipping? Trump's hair (ok, the last one was a joke)?

653 2018-03-02 18:29:43 Shouldn't Gary "globalist" Cohn as Director of the President's National Economic Council, and as former aluminium siding salesman and commodities broker, be blamed for the steel & aluminium tariffs being considered?

@Scaramucci @KennedyNation @CNBC anti-#globalisation #WSJ #FT
654 2018-03-02 18:26:28 And that’s the big problem. Most 2A people don’t want to have a serious discussion about restrictions. Instead they just want to cast doubt or make false comparisons to cars or drugs or other commodities not designed specifically to kill people. It’s just dishonest.
655 2018-03-02 18:23:44 You don’t really need them. Globalism is actually wage arbitrage. Cost of goods like commodities don’t change and are market driven. The only competitive edge is wages and benefits to workers. Free trade is a wage arbitrage.
656 2018-03-02 18:22:28 Lower steel or other commodities prices for the 99% is good for long term growth. Those who are upset about tariffs are mad because they have over spent & still want a free ride on our backs. @PowerLunch
657 2018-03-02 18:19:24 I never understood why this was an issue. If every steel mill shuts down, we benefit from cheap steel. If China raises prices, we start opening steel mills and benefit from cheap steel. They are just commodities.
658 2018-03-02 18:06:52 In circumstances where one country is legitimately dumping below-market commodities in our country to destroy that market in our country. Yes. But are they?
659 2018-03-02 18:04:41 India Modi’s prep for next election is to raise tariffs on ag commodities. First, pulses, now palm oil. More money in hands of Indian farmers. Bad for Indians.

661 2018-03-02 17:55:48 There is a saying (I made up). “It’s never made sense to take profit in NYC real estate”. I think the opposite can be applied to commodities. “It’s never made sense to NOT take profit in commodities”.
662 2018-03-02 17:51:48 Congratulations for yet again setting the standard for the development of the African continent by ensuring that we are self sufficient in all the commodities that we consume

664 2018-03-02 17:38:01 Nigeria is in total chaos rn. People are suffering, no jobs, prices of commodities keep skyrocketing, insecurity, poor healthcare system...... The list of challenges are endless.
665 2018-03-02 17:35:28 The effects are already to be seen in basic commodities but many seem to be wilfully blind to it
666 2018-03-02 17:25:27 How do you figure? More manufacturing in-house equals more jobs...more plants...higher wage...less chance of faulty building...better oversight...higher quality.. I am in commodities...US product is ALWAYS preferred over rest of the world. Aussie is one of the only exceptions
667 2018-03-02 17:21:20 Seriously, he's "protecting" 19th century technology. Know why we ship manufacturing overseas so often? Because 21st century value is created by intellectual property not commodities like manufacturing and raw materials.
668 2018-03-02 17:19:22 American will is bumping stocks and commodities @maddow
669 2018-03-02 17:16:32 China’s problem is they cannot innovate. They don’t have a google, apple, Tesla, ect. Once the prices of commodities fall, they’re in a recession. With 1billion people in poverty that’s malnutrition and starvation
670 2018-03-02 17:10:47 .. Those two commodities also happen to be at the top of our short list of profitable exports.

You can bet any affected country will hit back with counter tariffs.

And of course, the folks who will be hit the hardest are among Donald's most faithful supporters.

673 2018-03-02 16:57:38 Money is clearly not wealth (if we understand by “wealth” the good and services we consume). Money cannot be consumed in the way that commodities can. Libertarians are fond accusing Keynesians of saying that “money is wealth” or that “money creation is wealth creation.”
674 2018-03-02 16:54:26 And his buddy Icahn cleaned up last week, selling off steel commodities. But I’m SURE there was no insider info shared.  
675 2018-03-02 16:52:54 Don’t forget we produce NOTHING outside of Ag commodities, we have almost no leverage when push comes to shove when the dollar gets rejected globally.

681 2018-03-02 16:37:40 Who do you think actually pays those tariffs? The companies will pay more for those commodities...either by paying more for us products or via tariffs. Cost get passed along to US consumer. How much is alum tariff going to add to a can of diet coke?

683 2018-03-02 16:35:23 Do you know what trade wars do to the global economy? Do you understand what happens to consumer confidence when the price  commodities like beans, soda, and tuna go up? Keep ranting but economists are not on Trumps side and we will all pay a price!
684 2018-03-02 16:35:10 Amazon grew over 60%. What is your point? 

Yes, innovations in commodities are rare. Why? B/c most are mature industries & the ROI doesn't make sense. However a tariff changes the math & it's likely a US steel company will use the opportunity to invest to increase market share.
685 2018-03-02 16:34:35 As an EU citizen I hope EU, India, Canada, Mexico and China act in unison and collectively slam tarrifs on US producties or commodities. Preferably products/commodities which are tied to industries in red states.

705 2018-03-02 15:44:34 This is idiotic. How does increasing the cost of commodities help grow the economy?  It's basically a hidden tax on consumers.
706 2018-03-02 15:38:44 Anyone opening a VI or Asokoro, or even London type of business in Onitsha must have a friendly price as most, if not all their commodities are sold in the Onitsha open market. Then have exceptional service.

If you wanted quality you already had to go to "made somewhere other than China" so not a real loss here...

714 2018-03-02 15:17:42 The only Nigerian that truly have Nigeria at heart is @AlikoDangote 
You see it in his actions, because of him Nigeria do not import so many commodities like sugar, cement, flour etc and now he is unto bigger things, rice mills and oils refineries 
Aliko The Nigeria’s savior
715 2018-03-02 15:12:24 you're an uninformed moron.  you are going to put hundreds of thousands out of work in other industries tied to the steel industry. And btw countries like Canada that export steel to u.s. greater than China does is going to retaliate elsewhere with other commodities #simpleton
716 2018-03-02 15:12:22 I wish you had as much passion for technology as you do for steel and commodities. We have a high risk of losing our technology lead here, and certainly our security.
717 2018-03-02 15:12:18 There is also an opportunity for tokens which are the digital representations of rights to commodities. They’d be regulated by the CFTC under the Comm Exchange Act. As with other commodities, they could be traded by speculators and hedgers

722 2018-03-02 15:01:33 Rare commodities are worth more than good
723 2018-03-02 14:55:57 Dk if its just me, but the govt should start looking at regulating parking rates just like other commodities.
724 2018-03-02 14:55:54 So, tariffs on steel and aluminum, for example, will drive up the cost of those commodities. This will make EVERYTHING made with steel or aluminum more expensive.  How is this good for the American people when they are paying more for cars, appliances, etc?
725 2018-03-02 14:55:37 My husband and I had a lengthy discussion about this last night after watching you. He works for a manufacturer that relies on steel to make their products. He is a Commodities manager and is responsible for trying to keep costs down. This is not going to make his job easier.
726 2018-03-02 14:54:49 Agreed!  And, these countries flooding the market with below cost commodities are trying to corner the market.  It is too critical (as Trump agrees) that we maintain the ability to produce steel and aluminum for not only our infrastructure, but also our defense.
727 2018-03-02 14:54:43 Once we get cranked up, US steel and aluminum will be as cheap as anywhere.  Self Sufficiency in EnergyMaterials/Commodities/Labor/technology = security.  We own technology, that's the spark.  ALL IN w/TRUMP.. SwampRats can't/won't survive.
728 2018-03-02 14:52:48 While “saving” commodities production (low skill, low margin, high environmental cost) and destroying manufacturing (moderate to high skill, high margin, lower environmental impact)? This makes sense? And what if history repeats itself and this triggers a Global depression?
729 2018-03-02 14:45:47 Ugly action in lithium stocks. I said a while ago that a projected shortfall in a commodity in 4 to 5 years is a terrible basis on which to make an investment case. 4-5 years in commodities is an age.
730 2018-03-02 14:39:16 The opposite. Clinton repealed GS Act, and replaced w/ Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Commodities Exchange Modernization Act, & passed Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Ocean Shipping Reform Act, Communications Reform, etc. all of which led to monopolization of MOST TRADES & related financial markets
731 2018-03-02 14:38:34 Ngm aqui disse que vc era defensor do comunismo, oq eu disse foi que quando as commodities começaram a ser produzidas de forma capitalismo a miséria diminuiu de forma absurda.
732 2018-03-02 14:34:23 A lot of bad press here. Support #America people. We can not all have fake jobs. Some rely on steel and commodities to pay the bills. Move to Canada like the Hollywood libs threatened to do if you don't like it
733 2018-03-02 14:33:32 @eikebatista consumo, operadoras de telecomunicações e exploradoras de commodities - estão enfrentando dificuldades para atrair novas empresas de tecnologia. Se essa tendência persistir, poderá excluir bolsas como a B3 de um dos setores de crescimento da economia brasileira.
734 2018-03-02 14:31:29 Frantically trying to adjust your quotes due to the recently announced commodity #tariffs? With FACTON, adjustments are done in minutes. #manufacturing #commodities #costing #quoting
735 2018-03-02 14:30:11 Destaque: nossos agricultores estão sendo estimulados pelas políticas públicas a produzir commodities para alimentar porcos na China ao invés de alimentos básicos para a população ...
736 2018-03-02 14:29:16 Well competition is always important, and people should "vote" with their dollars. The issue has been it's not a two-way street. In ex., in commodities, cheap is attractive. China floods the US with cheap steel, because they artificially influence raw material prices.
737 2018-03-02 14:27:00 Isso é uma simplificação enorme. Até o século 16/17 boa parte das commodities eram produzidas de forma não capitalista (sistemas servis feudais em vez de trabalho assalariado). A possibilidade de possuir e trocar meios de produção (terras, máquinas) era muito limitada.
738 2018-03-02 14:26:57 The tariffs by Trump on steel and aluminum are in essence a tax on all users of those commodities: autos, coke cans,etc. IOW on everyone. 

I don’t need any more taxes. 

Look for Cohen to possibly leave WH.
739 2018-03-02 14:25:29 It's a deflection from the topic at hand, an attempt to make a completely irrelevant hypothetical equivalency rather than stay on topic that animals need no longer be enslaved as food/clothing commodities for modern society.
740 2018-03-02 14:25:03 There is need to reduce costs in logistics and improve processing on agricultural commodities. What models work best for processing and storage?
741 2018-03-02 14:23:43 Yes if China stops buying are bonds. That’s really bad. Just like Mexico buying farm commodities from Brazil 1000 percent more product. The don is out to destroy the USA.

743 2018-03-02 14:22:44 Like the last time we imposed tariffs on those commodities? Ok........
744 2018-03-02 14:22:23 Brit, do you really want to just let America keep getting raped thru al these horrible trade deals the past administration signed us up for????   C'mon Brit, have some respect and faith in America and all her commodities!  Fair & Reciprocal Trade!
745 2018-03-02 14:18:52 "O Brasil só vende commodities" é uma mentira descarada. Também vendemos empresas estratégicas...
746 2018-03-02 14:14:39 And then poor people in America will pay more for commodities. Huge win!
747 2018-03-02 14:14:27 Mas são muitos os que defendem que esta foi a parte positiva do regime. Afinal, sendo o catch-up tecnológico uma quimera, tamanho o gap, que alternativa a algum protecionismo pode haver se o desejo é escaparmos da dependência das commodities?

749 2018-03-02 14:04:19 Steel and aluminum became global commodities back in the 1970s. Trump thinks US steel and aluminum companies would expand with tariffs, and workers would be very happy. He actually believes that he can bring back to life the US industries of 30 years ago with tariffs. It’s insane

753 2018-03-02 13:41:01 Trade is NOT easy! It’s hard! Very hard! Anything you do creates ripple effects across other markets and commodities. ANYONE with a basic understanding of world economics knows that! Maybe you should have spent more time reading in school.
754 2018-03-02 13:39:45 Watching morning news. Slow chuckle at the confusion about why steel tariffs could hurt ag trade...but it’s telling just how much people don’t understand about ag commodities and the US $$$ at stake. US farmers stock the world’s pantry. @FarmersForTrade
755 2018-03-02 13:37:27 ETF paper commodities with no need to actually buy the product keeps the price artificially low, dumping the ETF paper drives the physical commodity like gold price down. The market is also fixed, with a freeze on trading if the unexpected happens, short selling swaps. Go Crypto!
756 2018-03-02 13:36:53 @StephenAtHome I totally get your confusion about #sorghum @SorghumGrowers can help you understand just how much $$$ at stake with the retaliation from steel tariffs. Ag exports are the ONLY trade surplus in this country. We feed the world with our commodities @FarmersForTrade
757 2018-03-02 13:35:22 It's humorous that hosting is called a commodity, and then talk about lock in and high pricing. Did they study economics in college? I find it hard to believe that anyone truly believes that Amazon doesn't understand price elasticity, especially for commodities...

760 2018-03-02 13:30:13 Agreed! I started my career in agricultural commodities at CBOT.  Soybeans were the king of commodities back then.  Green revolution had begun. Still very important component of U.S. trade.
761 2018-03-02 13:30:00 we can't rely on nations that one day could be our enemy to be suppliers of goods & materials we'd need to protect ourselves (from them or others). we must take care of america! thank you for seeing to this. there are other commodities needing re-assessment as well, to #MAGA 
762 2018-03-02 13:28:59 Weaker dollar, stagflation, risk of bigger correction in stocks... all good for Gold, Silver. Commodities benefiting from inflation concerns but a major stock market reversal is deflationary in the ST. LT, commodities going a LOT higher imo which I've said for a year now.
763 2018-03-02 13:25:56 I tried to say this for some time that the market has no justification at these prices and buy SPXS, or buy out of the money put options for protection. Dow down 251 this morning.  Stocks tumble as Trump sets stage for trade war! #Stocks #Commodities #ETF #Invest
764 2018-03-02 13:25:20 And if wishes were horses. It won't work that way. Prices will rise. Americans will begin paying more for a variety of products and commodities that are elementally chained to imports.
765 2018-03-02 13:12:38 In brief, HW Bush put FTA in place for Clinton Admin, and that led to NAFTA, WTO, GATT reform, and related Trade Deals, Tax Code, & Acts of Congress - that led to 76K factories & 96M jobs now offshore.

770 2018-03-02 12:54:39 Lot to digest there  Which other asset classes would you recommended? Commodities, currencies, bonds?
771 2018-03-02 12:53:23 Currently most ag commodities are priced at near or below the cost of production. If it gets much worse you better learn how to grow your own. Good luck.
772 2018-03-02 12:43:11 Your only business experience is skimming profits off companies you run in to the ground. You don't know anything about commodities, goods, retail, trade. Trade wars are so easy to win countries do it all the time & stock market loves it...except neither is true. You're an idiot
773 2018-03-02 12:41:32 The only assertion I'd challenge is 'All countries ... do most of their trade with their geographic neighbours (...it's cheaper)?'. That's true of physical commodities, of course, but much 'trade' (eg financial services) is undertaken electronically globally now.
774 2018-03-02 12:40:40 If you truly believe in your thesis that there will be a trade war, you should put it in assets that will benefit from goods that you believe will have trade restrictions /tariffs. Up to you to decide what that is, maybe clothing, consumer electronics, certain commodities.

789 2018-03-02 11:59:41 There’s no cartel in steel. Imports are fragmented by country. Commodities  like rare earths or lithium could pose issues eventually.

806 2018-03-02 10:53:30 RT @EIU_Commodities: The US's move to restrict steel imports is a clear response to over-production of #steel and other industrial goods in #China in recent years, which has driven global prices down.

819 2018-03-02 10:09:09 We're unsure if the steel and aluminum tariffs will impact the AUSFTA (Australia US Free Trade Agreement) that came into effect 1 Jan 2005. I couldn't find those commodities in the deal. I'd say Trump is targeting China but seems close allies will be collateral damage.
820 2018-03-02 10:05:42 Even if true, the substantive difference between low commodities prices/no UBI and higher commodity prices/UBI is that with UBI you have eliminated the state of stuck-at-zero. For many, having higher prices but something to work with is significantly better than stuck-at-zero.

829 2018-03-02 09:02:23 Never ever invested all your savings in one basket. Try to diversify your riches in a lot of investment. Some in derivatives, commodities, real estates, fixed deposits, bonds, treasury, insurance policy and etc. Diversification will insure your future.
830 2018-03-02 08:54:37 Yea but Stan, the capitalist ruling class ain't gonna turn their commodities into social goods. You gotta get rid of them first.
831 2018-03-02 08:54:15 Oil companies & others that produce commodities are tied directly to our economy & trade and ARE political. Just saying what Starbucks CEO, or Macy’s, for example, thinks I really don’t care.  That’s my choice.
832 2018-03-02 08:40:32 Because humans stupidly see them as economic commodities. Their brains are stuck in the prehistoric era.
833 2018-03-02 08:34:49 Thinking logically, sometimes a dangerous thing to do when dealing with the donald, the threat of trade war may well put stocks and shares into a spin and instead move investments to commodities. Of the high tech battery metals #Vanadium is clearly the best performing. More to go
834 2018-03-02 08:34:25 China will be the most impacted
Commodities prices will come down... negative to neutral for India
Lower crude positive for India...
Dollar surge will be good for IT sector..
Americas economic recovery making it powerful again will benifit India being a close partner
835 2018-03-02 08:29:50 Whenever I here a returnee talk what works for the West to be replicated immediately here it irks me to the core, we need incremental production of commodities & deliberate marketing to appeal to the Ghanaian new taste or preference #CitiCBS

837 2018-03-02 08:27:08 Advanced economies should be focussing on developing cutting edge technology and not commodities. Steel investment needs a stable 20 yr horizon and probability of a future reversal is high, so this will be destructive to US jobs.

892 2018-03-02 02:41:39 Gold, crude oil, copper, aluminium & steel are on the rise from a year ago. Crude palm oil, rubber & wheat almost bottom out. Some hedged against inflation or received growing demand from China or have a supply constraint. You also can trade commodities in futures market!
893 2018-03-02 02:39:41 This is the elephant in the room.  If commodities top, bonds top.  All the bs yield forecasts fall short.  Long duration tech back in driver seat.
894 2018-03-02 02:39:04 China has indicated it could retaliate against U.S. steel tariffs by targeting imports of U.S. agricultural commodities.
895 2018-03-02 02:35:03 On tariffs, it is reasonable to treat steel and aluminum as commodities essential for our national security. I would include oil in the same set. We must strive for self-sufficiency in these commodities. If a credible case for tariffs is made in that vein, I am okay with it. 4/
896 2018-03-02 02:32:43 Trade wars go both ways.  Trump won’t care when commodities tank.  Matter of fact, he’ll bet on it and make money anyway.
897 2018-03-02 02:32:22 Commodities & equities have an inverse relationship unless there is impetus for growth in the economy. Rising inflation & a weaker dollar also positive for investment in commodities.

900 2018-03-02 02:30:17 Continue 2: investors would be going after commodities that are not directly depressed by lower stock prices, likely gold or stable international currencies, or even natural gas (since people always need to heat up their homes) etc.

910 2018-03-02 02:05:30 Normal is an arbitrary average on a bell curve. What is normal for a Siberian nomad or a New York commodities broker? It's enough to be kind and live true to yourself.
911 2018-03-02 02:03:36 The President is attempting to get a level field on these two commodities. We can’t afford to lose our capabilities in these two critical national security items. Dumping is bad for everyone, regardless of  who is doing it.
912 2018-03-02 01:54:53 It’s an export. We only export 13% of commodities. That’s because our economy is so diverse. These tariffs were stupid.
913 2018-03-02 01:52:45 China has been dumping these commodities for years .....how do you compete with a non profit ? 

It's the communist that are screwing us over and you are supporting a communist country.

931 2018-03-02 00:44:13 Well, not since thatcher sold off all our public services, no, you’re right, I do have to rely on private companies to obtain those commodities. That’s a bit of a straw man argument. Does that mean I’m not allowed to criticise them because I’m forced to buy things from them?
932 2018-03-02 00:41:23 "Externocidio" seguimos tomando deuda y esperando los brotes verdes. Tomamos como modelo a Alemania, un país altamente industrializado. Aún no se generó empleo genuino, impuestos aumentan 40%, inflación, no tenemos capacidad de producir servicios y nuestros commodities no rinden
933 2018-03-02 00:40:47 Pior que o 1% foi devido apenas à subida de preço das commodities no mercado internacional. Não tem nada a ver com produção/crescimento. Fora que 2017 foi o ano de MAIOR crescimento mundial desde 2007. Ou seja, se contextualizar, como disse a anta amestrada acima, fica bem pior.
