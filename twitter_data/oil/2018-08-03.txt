1 2018-08-05 23:59:55 Every time I see @tedcruz I think he's covered in olive oil and if you squeezed him over a bowl you could make some dipping sauce for your garlic bread
2 2018-08-05 23:59:41 Bangladesh could really use some oil right now
3 2018-08-05 23:59:36 Are we talking mayo or olive oil infused aioli? Because this may be a good, or awful question lol.
4 2018-08-05 23:59:34 Can someone name 1 past PM who has continuously insulted Canadians, destroyed it’s oil industry, insulted other nations,failed on international trades,created obsene debt load,taxed us to poverty while enjoying spending our tax$ travelling around domestically&World with friends?
5 2018-08-05 23:59:29 Can we stop importing their oil now?? Canada needs to Shop Canada!!
6 2018-08-05 23:59:25 On my way to see kenari trees for the first time! These trees produce a #nut that’s shaped like an almond, but with an oil content similar to macadamia. #Alor #localingredients
7 2018-08-05 23:59:20  naw they could’ve used a spoon that had garlic on it!!! 

Just be like “oh no.. I know this ain’t peanut oil LAAAAWWWD”

9 2018-08-05 23:59:08 Well, at least he has the bad environmental laws part right. Trump was pushing coal until he found out that whale oil lamps were much more efficient. No more laws about whale protection!

11 2018-08-05 23:58:59 Forget Big Oil or Big Banks or the NRA. The true puppet masters, the lobby that makes politicians everywhere quake with fear just hearing their name, is Big Bicycle.
12 2018-08-05 23:58:57 Nobody was getting killed *at scale*.

Yes Saddam was a ruthless dictator who had the opposition assassinated or disappeared.

Those deaths probably number in the hundreds.  

That doesn't compare to the million people who died as a direct result of the oil grab invasion.

17 2018-08-05 23:58:22 Oh, you want the sure thing. I see. That’s why your an investor? Stock markets are a sure bet? 

Well then, burn that oil, raise that sea, let’s see how much damage we can do. Because doing nothing is always the safest bet to ensure that nothing changes.

39 2018-08-05 23:58:05 I bought a few items st Walmart. Old lady cashier rings up bread, motor oil, and popsicles. She says to me "it must be tough being a single father." I don't have kids. #walmart #bestofwalmart #nokids #singlefather #singlefatherprobs #comedy #funny #lol #panda
40 2018-08-05 23:57:52 Need to talk to them about who they originate there E85 with one problem I see is when it hits the rack and the oil “affiliates touch it it seems to become high priced If they can direct source it from a plant it is much cheaper
41 2018-08-05 23:57:42 the best thing to do to a yummy tomato is to slice it up, salt and olive oil, onions if you'd like, and tons of (real) feta cheese on top
42 2018-08-05 23:57:28 hold on guys, i have to go oil togami's slick, bald head
43 2018-08-05 23:57:25 A REAL govt for #Canada would boycott Saudi oil, get our pipeline built, and get on with it.

45 2018-08-05 23:57:16 Oil treatmen (argan oil) + deep conditioning ( lovea shea butter hair mask). God with me 
46 2018-08-05 23:57:15 @Walmart Westminster Dianna #Walmart manager suddenly showed up and is the only one who has been understanding and helpful. Thank you Dianna. Regardless this is my last time at this miserable excuse for a tire/oil change shop.
47 2018-08-05 23:57:04 Tip: Regrowth oil for edges, eyebrows, and eyelashes: black castor oil, ylang ylang, and lavender. Dassit.
48 2018-08-05 23:56:56 you gotta say something about the oil used next time 
49 2018-08-05 23:56:47 So much for small business, micro breweries.
I am flummoxed, is that all it took?
Ontario was once the centre of business in Canada.
Their eggs in a basket was the auto industry, like oil and Alberta. 
Ont resented BC had established relations with the Pacific Rim. 
Missus yet?

51 2018-08-05 23:56:36 who the FUCK pissed in a bowl and labeled it as olive oil! My pancakes are ruined! I feel like i have been targeted and i will be suing this convention! #womenunite #womeninagile
52 2018-08-05 23:56:07 ....wasn't convenient for the United States Of Oil Imperialism, or their Iackey B'liar, to wait for that, though, was it?  And unthinkable numbers of people died over that greed.
53 2018-08-05 23:55:47 Vitamin E oil is safe for piercings and might make it slick enough to come out
54 2018-08-05 23:55:45 Good ole , beard oil
55 2018-08-05 23:55:19 Skin So Soft by Avon. Do the oil and not the lotion. It makes your skin lucious and beautiful, smells amazing, and mosquitos won’t come near you. 

I grew up on the bayou in south Louisiana. This shit is magic!
56 2018-08-05 23:55:09 Time for the fryup tomato. Cut in half, cook briefly in some olive oil (or other tasty fat), top with salt and pepprr
57 2018-08-05 23:55:04 I really want a color changing oil diffuser.
58 2018-08-05 23:54:55 Brain controlled by $ Oil and Gas $ payoffs.
59 2018-08-05 23:54:52 I bet.  Last night we went to Italian for dinner and the olives were in orange juice and rhinds, I didn't know till it was too late.  I took a cbd oil cap and today only have a very dull manageable headache.
60 2018-08-05 23:54:17 Iran supplies India with all its oil needs. They supply Japan, china, south Korea, Taiwan etc etc. That a lot of cash or food trade coming in. Iran has oil pipe lines running into asia. Nothing like the situation in Venezuala.
61 2018-08-05 23:54:06 There aren't that many countries which rely so much on oil, and those who do like Saudi Arabia have the fortune of foreign support.
62 2018-08-05 23:53:53 You say a lot of dumb things. This is one of the dumbest. You mean the laws that allow carbon dioxide to be pumped into the atmosphere with no regulation, to benefit oil companies? Oh, sorry, that's a conspiracy between the chinese and every scientist. Fake news, right?
63 2018-08-05 23:53:51 Looks good. I like to do the caprese a little differently. I take the tomatoes and mozzarella and put it in the oven with a little olive oil, salt, pepper, and basil. Do the balsamic glaze after the cheese has melted. Fantastic little side dish.
64 2018-08-05 23:53:15 Ah products. Yep. I was a product junkie when I first went natural. Name it, I had it. Someone just had to mention it & I bought it. Took me a while to figure out what my hair liked & that certain things that were holy grail for others was most def not on my hair. Eg coconut oil.
65 2018-08-05 23:53:06 The U.S. military’s Central Command on Wednesday confirmed it has seen increased Iranian naval activity. The activity extended to the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic waterway for oil shipments the Revolutionary Guards have threatened to block. -Reuters
66 2018-08-05 23:53:04 During your next epsom salt bath, throw some almond oil in there. Works wonders.
67 2018-08-05 23:52:26 The point here is that we buy a huge amounts of oil from Saudi Arabia because we have no way of getting Alberta oil to Eastern Canada.
68 2018-08-05 23:52:19 How about recent years + without oil money?? Atleast again Wigan u can use your 'history'
69 2018-08-05 23:52:09 Really? What if Saudi Arabia decides to stop oil shipments to Canada? I’m sure we have a backup plan in place. Don’t we?
70 2018-08-05 23:52:08 é verdade sim.
até porque o mercado que lhes dá riqueza (oil) está em queda, e eles têm de arranjar alternativas económicas.
Todavia, não é por se pôr mulheres ao volante que vão virar autoridade moral dos direitos humanos.

74 2018-08-05 23:51:55 Climate change is real and being made worse 
by using fossil fuels, 
like coal & oil.  
Your policies are making it worse.  
We need to switch go green energy, 
solar, 
wind, 
etc.  
Wake up!

78 2018-08-05 23:51:27 Plenty of hard boiled eggs if you can hack em.  Also, bullet proof coffee in the am with butter and coconut oil will keep you satiated for most of the day.
79 2018-08-05 23:51:23 As a democracy, Venezuala is much easier to manipulate. The US knows that a war against Iran, or a civil war would cause a massive oil price shock. Iran eventually WILL be overthrown.
80 2018-08-05 23:51:21 I guess No more oil will be going to canada .
81 2018-08-05 23:51:16 Coconut oil does have yuh skin feeling luscious.

85 2018-08-05 23:50:54 See! Drinking Oil isnt that bad, kids!
86 2018-08-05 23:50:48 What 70 year old pipeline? What the heck are you talking about?  There is currently no pipeline from Alberta to Easter Canada. And your comment about the Oil Sands product is inaccurate.
87 2018-08-05 23:50:47 I’m about to put moska oil in my hair and smoke the rest of this joint, easy like Sunday evening  hahahaha
88 2018-08-05 23:50:35 He probably had them lit on fire this message is about drilling oil
89 2018-08-05 23:50:15 The list  of oil  production  cost  of the  United  States  $36 a barrel  of Miami
90 2018-08-05 23:50:09 【ad】Few things are as versatile as our oil. "Oilmighty" can use for cooking, gear and even lubricant for your relationship!
91 2018-08-05 23:50:00 Are you sure there are sustainable sources of palm oil?
92 2018-08-05 23:49:45 No weed, outta oil cartridges it’s tight
93 2018-08-05 23:49:33 At least I can pay you by my oil 
94 2018-08-05 23:49:24 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
95 2018-08-05 23:49:02 Good. Saudi Arabia is a vicious theocratic regime. Now, we can use our own oil.
96 2018-08-05 23:48:58 Apparently oil tax revenue for 17/18 is 17.4 billion smackeroonies. Sorry, pounds. I'm having trouble finding that though, and according to the OBR, it's forcast at about £1.12 billion. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.
97 2018-08-05 23:48:54 Last anyone looked Canada is an exporting oil nation So why buy any oil from the Saudis? Short of that they have nothing to offer. It’s doing Canada a favour...
98 2018-08-05 23:48:33 They also have better quality oil and a long  developed refinery system and infrastructure making raising cash through oil sales much easier.
99 2018-08-05 23:48:20 Exactly, and while the 3rd Wave Feminists lament the lack of women in STEM programs, I've heard nary a one decry the lack of women in the dangerous jobs that are mostly by men (electricians, oil rigs, utility repair, garbage pick up, plumbing roofers) ect.
100 2018-08-05 23:48:03 Once i get my oil changed, my brakes fixed, my window fixed and my rear manifold replaced, its OVER for you bitches 
101 2018-08-05 23:47:40 Nevada is so hot that the coconut oil from my hair keeps melting down my neck.
102 2018-08-05 23:47:39 ALISA has been set free for 2 years - 8 years of Heroin Addiction- no rehab - just my Fasting and Praying and obeying God - his directing me regarding Her situation - during Passover - she felt something Changed when I anointed her with Holy oil over her head to her feet-
103 2018-08-05 23:47:28 Orville in the whirley pop using coconut oil. THE BEST.
104 2018-08-05 23:47:27 southern thing my mom used to make...fresh sliced tomatoes, sliced cucumber, onion, water, vinegar, little olive oil, salt, pepper. chill.

109 2018-08-05 23:46:42 my thoughts on oil painting so far:

- understanding the simplification of colors is maaad important
110 2018-08-05 23:46:39 I need to find the motivation to clean this bathroom and give these dogs a bath but instead I'm transferring my jojoba oil into smaller traveling bottles ???
111 2018-08-05 23:46:37 More recently in Syria they failed. In Yemen they failed, as for Libya that adventure made Libya the route to refugees invasion of Europe and Britain. Also, the wars I mentioned were costly over 7 trillion dollars, price of oil up, economic collapses in USA Britain and Europe.
112 2018-08-05 23:46:17 What about NATO which your country is part of, killing thousands in Iraq in the name of nuclear weapons which they never found and was only oil game
113 2018-08-05 23:46:05 OMG this Trader Joe’s cauliflower crust is AMAZING!! I cooked dough just like box directed and it’s amazing!!!!! So delicious. Mozzarella cheese,pepperoni,grated cheese, oregano and black pepper and olive oil!!!!  yum! #ketodiet #getoguido
114 2018-08-05 23:45:53 Chop up and sauté in a pan with olive oil, basil, garlic and toss with some fettuccine - don’t give in to the Big Tomato eat-it-raw pressure!
115 2018-08-05 23:45:52 It should be based in Benghazi as most of the oil comes from Cyrenaica
116 2018-08-05 23:45:39 I rubbed this with salt, pepper and olive oil and it's called the Buttfartfish?
117 2018-08-05 23:45:32 With oil on the ass huh?
118 2018-08-05 23:45:28 A little olive oil and some fresh basil or a touch of good balsamic. Add a little fresh parm if you have it.
119 2018-08-05 23:45:01 Most people don’t know CBD oil can help with a lot of things your taking pills for and ruining your health in the long run by taking them. Go green.
120 2018-08-05 23:44:56 oops, just dropped oil on my shirt
121 2018-08-05 23:44:55 If and when I propose to my wife, I’ll need three baby chicken, leather pants, a tricycle, and olive oil. 
122 2018-08-05 23:44:49 This is the new and modern Saudi Arabia. If the U.S. didn't need their oil they would be just another dictatorship suppressing thought and knowledge and human rights.
123 2018-08-05 23:44:37 I Just Bought This Jamaican Based Oil Na I Smell Like A Black & Mild 
124 2018-08-05 23:44:33 I just made the most potent weed brownie I’ve made so far with some really amazing oil. I’m so proud of myself
125 2018-08-05 23:44:31 DT/Zinke want to open up all beaches in USA to oil/gas exploration...WHAT IS THE VALUE OF CLEAN BEACH? HUGE...look at Red Tide Florida, started first on Gulf now also on EC. Farm/Centr Fl drain into Lake Okachoobee, chem used on farms leech into water. Kill fish/tourism/economy
126 2018-08-05 23:44:17 I’m an emotional oil spill
127 2018-08-05 23:44:10 Just started taking cbd oil yesterday and I can't wait to see results and reap all its benefits and to feel a difference within myself!  #cbdoil #cbdoils #cbd #CBDlife
128 2018-08-05 23:43:58 Angela White, I hope you see this. Out of curiosity, did Markus Dupree take care of you after your scene. Did he carry you to the shower, clean the oil off you, take you to dinner, give you a rose and a bag of your favorite chocolate? That's what I would have done.
129 2018-08-05 23:43:56 Lithium is the oil for communication
130 2018-08-05 23:43:56 Or the California fires would not be as massive if we would acknowledge climate change and had been proactive years ago with out the oil companies fighting us along the way.
131 2018-08-05 23:43:47 I like roasting it in the oven with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic.
132 2018-08-05 23:43:44 I love chili oil so much I could eat it with a spoon
133 2018-08-05 23:43:42 Maybe this could be a good thing. We might have to use our own oil.
134 2018-08-05 23:43:30 Hook that stupid fk up to a generator. That's hella lot of renewable energy to be had. Fk coal and oil. Problems solved.
135 2018-08-05 23:43:25 I don't know who I would be without chili oil
136 2018-08-05 23:43:13 I never cooked with exploding bacon before... Too much fat oil damn
137 2018-08-05 23:43:09 How ignorant are you? We have MORE OIL than we know what to do with it. The US buys more oil from Canada than anyone else. We don't need you "bloodied" oil. 

Keep believing what "House #Saudi" feeds you
138 2018-08-05 23:42:29 Me and my family argued about androids on the way home today. I’m on the side of the androids but my mum and brother are definitely sceptical. Simulated emotions are still emotions! My dad just likes to pretend to be a robot and asking me if I want some oil.
139 2018-08-05 23:42:18 And in fact it was rich from oil even after Chávez took over. The oil price crash caused most problems in famines and all. Don't see how that proves it was socialism's fault, and not a nation's incompetence to change it's dependencies.
140 2018-08-05 23:42:06 Chili oil
141 2018-08-05 23:42:06 Garlic flat leaf parsley olive oil balsamic salt pepper & chili flake
142 2018-08-05 23:41:55 Make a sauce of three tablespoons of olive oil, a teaspon of vinegar, diced garlic clove, salt, pepper. Whisk the mixture thoroughly. Mix with a diced tomato and roast with the potatoes.
143 2018-08-05 23:41:48 At least we don’t rely on Saudi oil because we have so much of our own. Oh wait....
144 2018-08-05 23:41:32 babY SWEETIE AVOCADO AND HONEY THEN OLIVE OIL WILL CLEAR THAT SHIT UP OVERNIGHT
145 2018-08-05 23:41:27 Don’t forget olive oil

148 2018-08-05 23:41:19 Lol we have factories , u no oil no car also no electric 
149 2018-08-05 23:41:11 Irving oil gets almost all its crude from Saudi Arabia- Atlantic Canada better hope they don’t cut it off since liberals killed energy east
150 2018-08-05 23:41:10 And don't have a snob when one can all and cry yourself an extra cooking oil.
151 2018-08-05 23:41:00 Me, gets an oil change 2000 miles ago: “I should be set”
Runs out of oil after said miles and almost blows up engine
152 2018-08-05 23:40:52 The Italian with oil & vinegar ..spicy mustard. Ask to add or sub out one of meats for slice of turkey.
153 2018-08-05 23:40:43 essential oil baths are the best

155 2018-08-05 23:40:36 The claim of the Ethiopian PM the Federal troops in the Somali Ethiopian territories will quell secessionist movement is false. Their mission is to remove the elected Government, appoint unelected "President" who allow the free flow of the oil without benefiting the local Somalis
156 2018-08-05 23:40:35 了解です...〜

165 2018-08-05 23:40:02 YEAH ITS LIKE sliced bread but it’s really tiny and they toast it with olive oil and top it with certain mixtures or spreads but i just like the bread by itself honestly
166 2018-08-05 23:39:58 Lmao im just saying it could just be oil
167 2018-08-05 23:39:55 niggas be having great ass skin and when you ask them they be like “i jUsT WaSh wiTh SoAp and WaTer” stfu bitch I’m over here struggling with some underground plant and some oil made from some country I didn’t even know existed and your just using tap water?????
168 2018-08-05 23:39:41 無意味に、二期だから心機一転再スタートしてね！！！ってだけじゃないと思うんですよねぇ　たぶん
169 2018-08-05 23:39:35 It had the most gorgeous scent: oil and old metal. I challenge @CBIHatePerfume to make "Teletype."
170 2018-08-05 23:39:33 if you're sweating cannabis oil do you know what a fucking goldmine that is?
171 2018-08-05 23:39:32 have to say, looks like some of my large oil paintings.
172 2018-08-05 23:39:28 Sure but my point was that the project was about export, not domestic oil sales.
173 2018-08-05 23:39:28 One but in my defense I was really hungry and broke....
174 2018-08-05 23:39:28 What’s next ? It’s due to a lack of oil drilling ?
175 2018-08-05 23:39:27 Baby oil asss whooopinnn huh ? mhmmm
176 2018-08-05 23:39:17 Slice and eat with mozzarella and basil and olive oil.
177 2018-08-05 23:39:14 As a result of me falling off the bed yesterday, this week's choices of pabango are: 

Calming Oil from Prosource and the Haplas na pangmalakasan from Jakarta that my aunt gave me.

Very good, Athina... very good.
178 2018-08-05 23:39:05 Exactly. We should have absolutely nothing to do with that disgraceful excuse for a government. Oil rich or not, lowering ourselves to that level goes against everything this Country stands for.
179 2018-08-05 23:39:01 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
180 2018-08-05 23:38:56 Where are the lithium deposit its the new oil
181 2018-08-05 23:38:56 i was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna
182 2018-08-05 23:38:44 God no... Much the  energy east pipeline was built in 1950 and it goes under lake Michigan.  A 70 year old pipeline would be  in grave danger should heavy abrasive tar sands oil be sent through it.
183 2018-08-05 23:38:37 そうですね！

185 2018-08-05 23:38:35 @Walmart in Westminster is probably the WORST place 4 an oil change. #Walmart quoted me 2hrs. Instead they lost my car. One of the cashiers/mechanics complained to us that they never tell people to leave it over night. I told him that they took over 4hrs and I’d had to leave.
186 2018-08-05 23:38:27 slice them semi thick horizontally and put salt and pepper and a little olive oil on them and just eat them like that, that’s the best way to enjoy fancy heirloom tomatoes with good flavor
187 2018-08-05 23:38:23 Niggah I don’t even run from oil  I’m dead! Scrambled eggs with toast don’t count as cooking 
188 2018-08-05 23:38:17 Honestly I’m probably gonna die alone because my ex is a white man who used to help me take my box braids out and rub my booty with coconut oil. I had it too good. rip to my love life
189 2018-08-05 23:38:12 You're absolutely right Michael. Bout time we did this. If the US and Canada worked together, we could crash Saudi Arabia and make Canada one of the top oil exporters to the Western world instead.
190 2018-08-05 23:38:11 Chop them up, Olive oil, snp, you good
191 2018-08-05 23:38:09 So you  grew in Attock oil area ? 
192 2018-08-05 23:37:55 My mom is applying for permanent residency and I made a joke about her being deported, to which she replied: 

"MY COUNTRY HAVE OIL".

Damn  me feelings hurt
193 2018-08-05 23:37:55 Cut em in half. Roast em. Sprinkle some thyme salt and olive oil on em. Serve em with chicken
194 2018-08-05 23:37:52 Don’t cry no more oil and ur government will come to saudi to kiss our foot this is the punishment of interference in the affairs of others
195 2018-08-05 23:37:51 The best kinda day consists of tanning oil in the day time & bug spray in the evening
196 2018-08-05 23:37:46 Chop, olive oil, salt, garlic, pepper.
197 2018-08-05 23:37:42 I have a question, how do you get rid of a oil or some sort of film like stuff on the Switch screen? I tried disinfecting wipe like the ones that r used to clean a spot before testing for your sugar. Thank you
198 2018-08-05 23:37:39 That was a good article, and you make a good point - an oil/gas lobbyist scapegoating Al Gore for flying everywhere is obviously throwing a red herring. That said, we shouldn't absolve ourselves of guilt when we have a choice to fly or not to fly, and choose to fly 4000+ people
199 2018-08-05 23:37:27 Bien sur. Mais si tu sais que ton voisin est psychopathe, l’envoyer chier n’est pas nécessairement une bonne idée. #oil #humvees
200 2018-08-05 23:37:23 Haha bitch that was oil alright  that shit popped at me so like can I cook yes, will I cook  depending on the guy 
201 2018-08-05 23:37:20 I’m gonna lose at least 2 minutes of sleep worrying about a shithole country that would be another Yemen if it didn’t have oil reserves.
202 2018-08-05 23:37:12 My ex introduced me to cinnamon oil when we had an any problem in our apartment. It worked very well inside, though the ultimate solution was to get the landlord to spray outside where they were coming in.

204 2018-08-05 23:36:46 I do believe that some of the  energy east pipeline was built in 1950 and it went under lake Michigan.  A 65 year old pipeline would be  in grave danger should heavy abrasive tar sands oil be sent through it.
205 2018-08-05 23:36:37 Found out that the reason my med room smells like Filipino food is because a fish oil capsule burst and it was left overnight థ◡థ
206 2018-08-05 23:36:35 MTB paid heavily, to Obasanjo and National Assembly, etisalat and airtel ,glo all bribed, all d oil companies bribed
207 2018-08-05 23:36:33 @weed_nurse a woman's cancer and sent her into remission without chemo but the government stopped her importing CBD oil but she's just over turned the ruling in House of Lords. Big pharma will probably fight it. Weed helped me when my brother was murdered in South Africa as Dr..
208 2018-08-05 23:36:30 I'm kind of a naturalist with this skin care thing. I'm 59. Coconut oil and rose hip seed oil are my friends for aging. Exfoliate often. I have super sensitive skin, so I can't use a lot of products.
209 2018-08-05 23:36:21 Tip: Coconut oil works best for high porosity strands (typically determined by frizz, dryness, and water testing). A consistent regimen for your Afro inclusive of botanical hair steaming lowers hair porosity.
210 2018-08-05 23:36:05 Diverted into the Pacific Ocean? You mean like a natural flowing river?

40 yrs GLOBAL WARMING denial by your rich oil masters has not helped either

Well at least you finally spoke up on California wildfires, I guess

Do u see the whole state as “blue” and therefore your enemy?
211 2018-08-05 23:35:48 i finally got rid of the oil paint under my right thumbnail only to get blue paint stuck under my left thumbnail >:(
212 2018-08-05 23:35:44 They mismanaged the money, their revenues are declining due to sanctions, but even with sanctions they enjoyed record high oil revenue and only during Obama's second term sanctions hit their oil revenue and banks. Before was more about technology transfer and didn't effect$$
213 2018-08-05 23:35:43 It's not just that they relied on oil, but that (unlike say Saudi Arabia) they hadn't always been. Chavez shifted to oil completely, and other previously productive sectors like agriculture withered. So when the oil money dried up, they weren't producing any food.
214 2018-08-05 23:35:39 Oil change
215 2018-08-05 23:35:38 I wonder how an essential oil made from Pride of Barbados will smell like but I'm willing to give it a try.
216 2018-08-05 23:35:36 Una proposta de luxe
217 2018-08-05 23:35:32 The Oil City Warehouse Mall is a dangerous place.

223 2018-08-05 23:35:14 #Quebec guess your buying #Alberta oil now. We also like Quebec
224 2018-08-05 23:35:13 You’ve bought the entire Trump / Koch arguments “hook, line, & sinker”. US are now producing more Batteries than everyone else combined. They want to down play GW & climate change to unwind their oil investments & buy de-valued Alternatives such as solar, wind & batteries. Check
225 2018-08-05 23:35:08 Haha. First cleanser tu guna oil/milk/balm cleanser untuk cuci segala mak nenek impurities, oil based products, macam sunscreen ke, makeup ke. Sebab takut jadi clogg pores so dia cuci sampai ke pori muka. Then basuh kedua dengan normal facial cleanser tu. Haha
226 2018-08-05 23:35:06 Alberta sells it oil in Canada? Refined oil? Pretty sure they ship some of it to refineries, like ours in NB.
227 2018-08-05 23:35:00 Oil exploration on the reef.
228 2018-08-05 23:34:58 Wtf does that?  I need it! I'm walking dandruff! Coconut oil and aquious cream only do so much.
229 2018-08-05 23:34:47 For many of them I think it's more that they backed a stinker and are doubling down rather than admit they were duped by snake oil salesmen - shysters and conmen who exploited their ignorance and prejudices.

233 2018-08-05 23:33:23 @Walmart on trask ave in Westminster took over 4 hours to change my oil. I had an obligation to get to so I came back the next day-today. My car is gone and they have no idea what happened. #walmart lost my car. Wtf Walmart?!?!
234 2018-08-05 23:33:19 Seeing what the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar did with their oil money, one begins to wonder if the oil Nigeria is selling is coconut oil 
235 2018-08-05 23:33:14 In England a boy who had 200 fit's a day on meds from NHS. So his mother got her hands on some CBD oil which stopped the fit's when placed under his tongue and drastically reduced the number of fit's. But at the airport they took his CBD oil away and they couldn't go. Also cured_
236 2018-08-05 23:32:22 I have no opinion on Iran deal and oil prices.
237 2018-08-05 23:32:11 Im starting to feel numb again.
238 2018-08-05 23:32:11 Regardless of your race, whether you’re white or black, always remember to pour oil in the pan when you’re frying eggs.
239 2018-08-05 23:32:00 Screw Saudi Arabia. We sure don't need their oil! Their human rights abuses warrant severing relations with them. Time they had to answer for their abuses and their support of terrorists. Time for the US to step up to the plate, too.
240 2018-08-05 23:31:58 Stains can be from oil lmao
241 2018-08-05 23:31:57 Same thing Americans did with oil in mid-east
242 2018-08-05 23:31:54 Went to @jimmyjohns and ordered a sandwich with oil and vinger. Got home and my sandwich had none. Called and talked to the manager and he said I'll have to drive 15 minutes back to get another sandwich. At this time I was already in my PJs. Not a happy customer at all.
243 2018-08-05 23:31:52 They probably inhale oil
244 2018-08-05 23:31:46 Oil under the reef!!!
245 2018-08-05 23:31:34 And oil wasn't always cheap and efficient
246 2018-08-05 23:31:27 haha yeah if I'm feeling a little belligerent I described this as asking a jet aircraft mechanic to change your oil. suuuure, they could probably do it no problem buuuut...
247 2018-08-05 23:31:18 Coming to try coconut and lemon oil
248 2018-08-05 23:31:17 Really a shame we have to do this, because even the worst olive oil made in Syria is ten times better than the best anywhere else. Never found anything as good.
249 2018-08-05 23:31:02 I blame the dinosaurs that died eons ago and turned into oil.
250 2018-08-05 23:30:57 You have such a reductionist world view. World powers reacted to the actions & autonomy (something you refuse to recongise they posses) of the Syrians' choice to revolt.

Do you also believe the Romanian Revolutionaries where paid by the CIA so as a plot to steal Romania's oil?
251 2018-08-05 23:30:42 He doesn't care about the people who have lost everything, or those who lost their lives.  His tweet makes it clear that all he cares about is helping his CEO buddies in the automotive and oil sectors make more money!!!
252 2018-08-05 23:30:35 fanola should help with the green/any yellow that inevitably creeps in (YELLOW ALWAYS DOES) i’d recommend using it once a week after a deep conditioning treatment with coconut oil. the oil naturally builds protein AND protects hair from the drying elements in purple shampoos.

254 2018-08-05 23:30:12 My brother dropped one in a can of dirty engine oil (yes, some still change the oil in their car by themselves).  Took it to the Apple store.  They replaced it free even though it was no longer under warranty.  I suspect the value in laughs was enough.
255 2018-08-05 23:29:58 インターンシップ現地行きます
256 2018-08-05 23:29:54 Tip: The more consistent you are with your Afro regimen (proper prepoo, cleansing, detangling, heat deep conditioning, aloe sealing and moisture layering) the less you need products w/ coconut oil.
257 2018-08-05 23:29:52 Thinking the drop in world oil prices to less than one half of what it was five years ago would not be attributed to Liberals and NDP in Canada.
258 2018-08-05 23:29:50 If you salt and pepper brussel sprouts in a pan with olive oil you get an amazingly delicious char it's so good
259 2018-08-05 23:29:48 Anyone (@kampeas) who thinks higher oil prices are caused by leaving the Iran deal is delusional. Higher oil prices are caused, by regulations in US against drilling, refining, exploration, & internationally by threats against transit of oil in international waters by terrorists.
260 2018-08-05 23:29:46 Roast with garlic and oil turning it every few mins when soft it’s done 
261 2018-08-05 23:29:21 Yup, both of those were huge, especially when you look at military spending generally. But malinvestment and oil are a huge part of most arguments I've seen for why the USSR fell when it did
262 2018-08-05 23:29:17 I know a guy who’ll take them for some lamp oil and rope as long as you have enough rupees, though... he also sells some other questionable items.
263 2018-08-05 23:29:15 @pink @hartluck I gave you some Lemon Myrtle essential oil on Friday in Melbourne as part of my pressies ,,  ,, on the box it says it gets rid of germs in the air and helps to clear up colds etc and it smells so good xx
264 2018-08-05 23:29:07 my weekend started at 5pm yesterday. I've been to 2 lakes, 1 birthday, shot 18, got drunk twice, sold a car, painted, changed my oil, washed clothes, jo 3xs, swam, bought pants, returned pants, now currently watching a movie #itneverends
265 2018-08-05 23:29:03 The whole “you’d still be in League 2 if not for oil money” take is honestly sooooooo funny. City got promoted back to the Premier League BEFORE being bought.
266 2018-08-05 23:28:35 Energy East was not being built for the purpose of supplying east provinces with oil.
267 2018-08-05 23:28:14 Your country has no sovereignty. When #Trump says go left, it goes left and when #Trump says go right, it goes right.
And when #Trump says increase oil production, it says Sami3na wa Ata3na.
And when #Trump says "Pay", it pays.
About what sovereignty are you talking ?
268 2018-08-05 23:28:04 what the fuck you STOLE my castor oil
269 2018-08-05 23:27:36 Sanctioned  oil  of 665461161652%365=1.8231816 is $36 a barel
270 2018-08-05 23:27:27 Frick, mocking Trudeau is brutally hard to keep up with...he's such a halfwit that just a few memes can be catch-all...lol. now he's messing with the Saudi's... On the + side he might have to buy Alberta oil for a while....
271 2018-08-05 23:27:26 Oh god changing the oil and cleaning the frying tanks/pools is a painnnnnn
272 2018-08-05 23:27:23 Baru perasan tersalah beli senka makeup remover ingatkan oil cleansing tak baca main ambikkk ajo
273 2018-08-05 23:27:23 You make no sense. How about a water pipeline across the country so areas suffering from drought can get relief. Much more in need than an oil pipeline AND if it leaks it won’t damage the environment.
274 2018-08-05 23:26:48 oil like palm oil pls.
275 2018-08-05 23:26:38 Might have to buy coconut oil to have on hand for next time  I deff plan on having a cool shower before bed
276 2018-08-05 23:26:36 The first one gets soggy from the oil and the second one keeps the shit together
277 2018-08-05 23:26:30 I will admit that I'm obsessed with COCONUT OIL!!!!!!
278 2018-08-05 23:26:24 HOW Algún cabrón ha untado el auricular,

279 2018-08-05 23:26:22 Damn. Maybe we should have a pipeline to bring Canadian oil East 
280 2018-08-05 23:26:21 THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Nathan please turn off the “peace in the middle east” switch so we can steal more oil
NATHAN: No
281 2018-08-05 23:26:17 Castor oil! Massage it into your brows everyday.

283 2018-08-05 23:26:03 It is individual integrity that speak not the party rather that is why some elite people backing and supporting PMB person that once a president of Nigeria that doesn’t have house abroad,no oil bloc, no any alleged of corruption
284 2018-08-05 23:25:59 Good!  Saudis can take their conflict oil and shove it.
285 2018-08-05 23:25:44 Remember when the News was wall-to-wall coverage of America invading two Middle-Eastern countries because of hurt feelings and oil? Now it's all tweets.
286 2018-08-05 23:25:34 False. Climate change is and has always been real. They’ve known about it for decades, yet never acted due to pressure from oil companies.
287 2018-08-05 23:25:24 Your missing the bigger & most urgent situation at hand bro. This has nothing to do with Abdi Illay at this time, it’s Oromo expansion to Somalis region trying to displace million’s of Somali’s in part because there is oil founded at the region, in part Oromo wants claim the land
288 2018-08-05 23:25:17 Does this mean we wont purchase oil from them?
289 2018-08-05 23:23:51 So the goal of Venezuela's dictatorship, oil nationalization, price controls and fear-mongering was... Home Ownership?
290 2018-08-05 23:23:46 Well done Candace, .@HillaryClinton is a snake oil salesman...apologies to the snakes.
291 2018-08-05 23:23:41 The broad strokes say oil and gas is the way to go but unless you’re a hire up or well connected you’re not making much more than average. Having a degree in any subject should be worth more than food stamps.
292 2018-08-05 23:23:40 Saudi Arabia, fearing the end if its oil supply, is desperate to find new revenue streams, so that move seems pretty reckless.
293 2018-08-05 23:23:34 My daily routine has changed now. No more palm oil smell, rubber smell, bumpy road, punch card,pajeri nenas for lunch.
294 2018-08-05 23:23:25 No more camel milk , ... they won't be buying weapons? We have oil
295 2018-08-05 23:23:20 Saudi was getting too cozy spending cash to scoop the Canadian Wheat Board and also farmland. Less Saudi crude would be good for  oil industry.
296 2018-08-05 23:23:11 I’m Cheer! Which Oil are you?
297 2018-08-05 23:22:58 POTUS Bush at the time should have demanded repayment in oil for our expenditures from these people. #Trump was so right on this!
298 2018-08-05 23:22:51 ええええ、
299 2018-08-05 23:22:33 Suddenly you are an environmental expert as well. What happened to shrinking the sizes of the National Parks for more oil drilling? Does that help the environment too?
300 2018-08-05 23:22:26 Quebecers wont be happy if Saudis shut off their oil shipments. #ReVisitEnergyEast

302 2018-08-05 23:22:13 I think it looked like that before the 1986 oil crash! And the investments seem to have finally come good, but in the meantime they arguably caused the collapse of the Soviet Union, which is no small matter...
303 2018-08-05 23:22:07 You have baby oil

337 2018-08-05 23:18:01 Yeah, clearly Germany is struggling, so far from the equator. They’re the world leaders in solar. True, mining lithium and other materials has its downsides. All of which pale in comparison to the mining, transport, and consumption of oil.

358 2018-08-05 23:14:41 Yes, let’s continue with an economic status quo that includes wage stagnation and ever-rising costs for practically everything. Let’s continue subsidizing oil and gas and doing our best to make life easy for corporations and the rich, while the rest of suffer. Great idea!
359 2018-08-05 23:14:40 My car* just emailed me to say it needed an oil change and had a link to schedule an appointment with the dealer. I love the future. *A service connected to my car’s internal computer

393 2018-08-05 23:09:30 I didn't say the price did not fall, but we still made enough money for the Buhari's led administration to function better than this.

400 2018-08-05 23:08:35 When the oil runs out, you'll be back to chopping each other's heads off and begging the Turks and Zionists to save your lazy asses from the Shia gunning for your royals and clerics.
Don't worry, MBS is moving the gold to infidel banks by the ton. All good.

402 2018-08-05 23:08:20 Our waters are a toxic soup of Corexit that sunk the oil from back in 2010, nitrogen fertilizer run off, Lake O's discharges from Big Sugar; basically anything the corporations want to put in there. Media won't say much because it will affect real estate and tourism industries. 2
403 2018-08-05 23:08:05 1 Teaspoon of Epsom Salt to a litre of water is all I use. Sometimes I throw in a little feed as well at half the recommended dosage per litre, I do that about every 4 feeds but it's not a strict rule, depends on how they're looking. 

(If I notice Aphids I put Neem oil in also)

420 2018-08-05 23:05:21 2) We should discuss why #Greenpeace ignores Venezuelan, Brazilian, Iraqi, Saudi, Mexican, Angolan Equadorian and other countries oil tankers arriving in North America.

How about a radio discussion? Great forum for a transparent conversation, if you’re into that sort of thing.
421 2018-08-05 23:05:16 Besides, jojoba oil, what’s a good carrier oil for natural hair. I’m severely allergic to coconut oil.

426 2018-08-05 23:04:43 Love oil Lamps! Had tons of them in our house growing up because of power outages in the winter. They make some great scented oils too.

Shea butter or Vaseline (with Shea Butter in it).

437 2018-08-05 23:03:08 CA does misuse water, for fracking b/c of humanity's manufactured dependence on fossil fuels, driven by you &your corporate cronies. You would hand over our remaining wild lands to support Big Oil & drive us deeper into environmental ruin. The rest of your tweet is pure insanity.

439 2018-08-05 23:02:50 @john_vidal I saw your documentary centered on oil spillage and the problems of the black gold in the Niger Delta. It was a very educative and eye-opening documentary. Would you be willing to answer some of my questions?
440 2018-08-05 23:02:50 I have family dinner every Wednesday:

• The seafood is hand caught from fisherman in my immediate family.

• on a boat paid wholly by oil income to my immediate family.

• the dining table is from a govt salary paid to my immediate family.
441 2018-08-05 23:02:37 Seriously wash her in coconut oil. The. Rinse with dawn soap and hydrogen peroxide. Only thing I have ever found to work!!
442 2018-08-05 23:02:26 It's the first time I've heard you decry the oil and gas industry in terms of production/extraction of fossil fuels vs. vehicle emissions/consumer action. Hope that you demonstrate consistency with this statement over time.
443 2018-08-05 23:02:21 I like summer because my coconut oil stays melted and I get to skip the first step of many recipes.
444 2018-08-05 23:02:20 1) Thank you for sharing this with your followers, hopefully they will all google it and ask questions...

Of the world’s top 10 oil exporters, Canada’s the leader in human rights and social progress.

Canada’s the only target for pipeline protest and obstruction by #Greenpeace

446 2018-08-05 23:02:02 Which kind of Mullahs? The really dangerous ones in Saudi Arabia where business houses and charities with full official patronage spread Wahabi hate against non-muslims globally? Iran’s Mullahs are angels by comparison.

449 2018-08-05 23:01:47 Exactly. Let’s create Canadian jobs. Stop relying on USA or others for oil.
450 2018-08-05 23:01:44 If President Trump can cut domestic oil consumption by about 6 million barrels per day now and 10 million barrels per day by 2025, then maybe we could become a Net Exporter for about a MONTH.
451 2018-08-05 23:01:40 Yes, but it’s with global economy rebounding, bottoming out of oil crash in western Canada and rising global trade volumes. I’m not saying he’s failing everywhere, I don’t believe he’s going to ruin us. I just simply don’t agree with all his policies. I’m not far right

465 2018-08-05 23:00:06 Oops I missed this yesterday!! I have an organic Peruvian coffee from Thrive Market & I froth almond milk & MCT oil into it. Use instead of meds.
466 2018-08-05 23:00:04 The tanks can get rusty inside. Did you drain the sump & run fresh oil & filter or will you do that when oil is warm?
467 2018-08-05 22:59:57 I would tend to doubt the report as ExxonMobile is essentially in the LNG business and not actively drilling for oil as far as I know.
468 2018-08-05 22:59:43 Wait...

Whoa!!!!!

What about this pipeline that the GOP is forcing across the American landscape to shop Canadian oil to the Saudi refinery in Texas???

495 2018-08-05 22:57:19 It’ll be interesting to see the timing and what that peak may be. Depending on price escalation in the coming decades what may have been uneconomical may become worth developing (heavy oil, oil sands, ultra deep water, arctic offshore, etc)
496 2018-08-05 22:57:13 Its a terrible decision for the fight as there will be no atmosphere at all for a potentially epic fight that deserves a big fight atmosphere. But I'm sure a ton of oil money has been laid down so financially its a good move!

500 2018-08-05 22:56:31 Pipelines don’t cause global warming...your car does etc. Banning pipelines for less safe ways of transporting oil actually causes global warming.. like trains burning fuel. So focus on your own personal transportation would be more effective
501 2018-08-05 22:56:29 Well, i do dig the Sinclair Oil Dinosaur sign!
502 2018-08-05 22:56:07 If we only had a massive reserve of oil somewhere in the country that potentially could serve all our domestic energy needs...and a pipeline could be built.
503 2018-08-05 22:55:45 If it has to be run by oil magnates, I would 100% unironically rather have the province of Alberta be in control of Mecca and Medina than the House of Saud

506 2018-08-05 22:55:13 GDP is not a conclusive measure of development. In Kenya, only 26% of people live in poverty(below $1.25/day) in comparison to Nigeria's over 60%. Moreover, Kenya's budget and revenue collection are higher than Nigeria's despite the huge oil exports for Nigeria.
507 2018-08-05 22:55:11 I use butter in a frying pan and just sprinkle salt and pepper on it and it's pretty dang good. I use kosher salt when I cook instead of table salt but either is fine. You could use oil instead of butter if you wanted
508 2018-08-05 22:55:05 If I’m making my moms Portugues Tuna casserole then def has to be in oil. Shit we add at least another 1/2 a bottle of olive oil anyway so why not start off oily

562 2018-08-05 22:47:23 Maybe the Saudis will refuse to sell oil to Quebec and Alberta can move into that market?

572 2018-08-05 22:45:07 There’s no better smell than olive oil, garlic, and onion sautéing in a pan 
573 2018-08-05 22:45:01 Oh it's Mr  l met two guys in the oil industry and they told me everything is rosy 
574 2018-08-05 22:44:52 It’s takes way too long to oil my locs 
575 2018-08-05 22:44:51 Now Canada is concerned about human rights in Saudi Arabia? Where the hell will Trudeau buy oil from after this? Surely not from Alberta?
576 2018-08-05 22:44:49 Took car for an oil change, then a fancy car wash (because there was a long line  at laser wash I usually use), put gas in car, then bought groceries so I can pack a lunch for the rest of the week. I almost feel like a responsible adult.
577 2018-08-05 22:44:48 As record temperatures bake much of the planet today, here in Canada our Prime Minister is "fighting climate change" by ramming through a massive new oil sands pipeline locking millions of tons of new greenhouse gas emissions for a generation. #trudeau #climate #cdnpoli #bcpoli
578 2018-08-05 22:44:47 THE RESISTANCE IS ALREADY LOW ON FUEL AND YOU WANT TO USE THEIR OIL FOR THIS
579 2018-08-05 22:44:41 No debt is paid off to my knowledge.  Maturing debt is just refinanced at prevailing rate.
580 2018-08-05 22:44:31 Hope they don’t do any business with Husky Oil’s Li Ki Shing (sarcasm!). Terrible bank. Doesn’t belong in Canada.

583 2018-08-05 22:44:03 I couldn't agree more.

I'm willing to pay the 6 or 7 bucks a gallon of gas to prove it (oil companies being welfare queens and all). You in?

587 2018-08-05 22:43:20 When your bfs mom calls you to ask what kind of olive oil you need. Those are the quality phone calls I want from a mother-in-law 
588 2018-08-05 22:43:02 And?? Who paid for that oil? Not "Eastern Canadians", a private enterprise made that choice because oil companies have no ethics.
589 2018-08-05 22:42:43 And what is to say Scotland could not have been in an even better situation without the Union? Are you seriously suggesting that the Union's squandering of Scotland's oil, made Scotland better off?

593 2018-08-05 22:41:32 Gotta call BS here. No debt will be paid down, and good question, when was last time any was truly paid off?
594 2018-08-05 22:41:22 What difference does it make in a free world where Iran ships their oil!
595 2018-08-05 22:41:20 By embracing Quebecois nationalism and indigenous rights he’s alienating KSA’s natural allies, mid-level oil management and their homeschool families in Greater Calgary.
596 2018-08-05 22:40:52 He didnt overstep the boundaries of his authority so your point is invalid. The only "coup" he did was denying oil for foreign corporations.

Shah kept Iran "protected" from socialists by killing and torturing them. His free economy led to no benefit for the less fortunate btw
597 2018-08-05 22:40:50 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
598 2018-08-05 22:40:38 but... are they still buying US oil?
599 2018-08-05 22:40:32 Yea Canada should now start using its oil and even exporting it. Show the middle finger to Saudis.
600 2018-08-05 22:40:29 You had the fluids flushed? And make sure they only use synthetic oil when they change that oil.
601 2018-08-05 22:40:28 I'm the best movie mom. I'll even pop my own world famous Tsunami Popcorn. Which is stovetop popped with sesame oil, then I melt butter and add teriyaki or soy sauce and then I'll toss the popcorn in that, along with diced dry wasabi seaweed snacks, and seaweed wrapped rice puffs

605 2018-08-05 22:39:40 Good. That simplifies things. Enjoy your desert hole you'll sink into when the oil runs out.

608 2018-08-05 22:38:54 I don’t even know why that is, when oil changes take like 15 to 20 mins
609 2018-08-05 22:38:40 They using that same track? It looked like it was covered in oil, never seen a track that colour.

611 2018-08-05 22:38:08 If I knew I had to go through the hell bc of the oil that's on my life I would have said no thank you, people don't know the price u pay for ur oil. Bishop McDaniel

616 2018-08-05 22:37:47 scott, after walking around new york on a 90-degree day: "I feel like an oil spoil"
617 2018-08-05 22:37:27 The problems r the same oil which both rely on heavily is not making any money so both countries have experienced the same problems only for WM subsidies I fear r nation could end up like that.
618 2018-08-05 22:36:43 A lil olive oil, some Adobo, Oregano and a couple of packets of Sazon, throw it on a baking sheet at 400° for an hour then turn on the broiler for 10 minutes... perfect pork rinds... stylish too 
619 2018-08-05 22:36:37 I needed more oil for my trimmer. I thought “avoid the crowds. Go to Peavey Mart instead of Canadian Tire”. Guess who didn’t have 4-Cycle oil, and which abomination I ended up at anyways
620 2018-08-05 22:36:26 first SAA should get its oil, water, and 30% of Syria back from PKK. then we can talk about Afrin.

626 2018-08-05 22:35:07 You can't criticise Scotland 'cos Venezuela has run into a political crisis.
Salmond was referring to the volume of oil controlled by Venezuela - they were extremely influential in the S. American continent.
Scotland could have gained the same recognition in Europe.
Context ffs.
627 2018-08-05 22:34:42 You should spill oil on their bit of road to learn them 
628 2018-08-05 22:34:34 Venezuela's Maduro is sweating bullets.
The mullahs are his main source of protection and $ now that oil production is down by 2/3rds.
I hear he may send his mighty Army to save the Ayatollah
629 2018-08-05 22:34:31 If so, then why are Americans hoarding their reserves in Texas, & buying cheap Saudi & Cdn oil? Obviously they believe it will one day run out & they want to be in full power when it does. Don’t waste ours out our tail pipes.Let’s get smart. Now US are producing batteries!!!!!!

636 2018-08-05 22:33:35 I think meth dealers have more integrity than essential oil dealers since at least meth dealers are honest about what their product does, whereas oil dealers try to make you think your life will change magically by selling or using their useless crap.

640 2018-08-05 22:33:00 We don't need their oil, but their cooperation in the region (which they only give sometimes), like dealing with ISIS, is kind of handy.  But ask @b_momani what we get/lose with the Saudis.
641 2018-08-05 22:32:57 Cbd oil is a godsend
642 2018-08-05 22:32:54 And the fact that BP was extracting oil in Iran certainly would have nothing to do with the fact that the ruler was Pahlavi, whose dynasty raised to power through a Britain supported military coup, right?

651 2018-08-05 22:31:50 Do we really need to be friends with them? As far as I can tell they are no better than Iran. Dont we have enough of our own oil that we can tell them to piss off and call them out on their oppressive nut job policies??
652 2018-08-05 22:31:47 They got a dumbass religion 'round here, not sure if you've heard about it, it's pretty fucked up. VERY racist. All that cis gender shit. Gamergate too, i think. Misc snake oil #Crapitalism.
653 2018-08-05 22:31:42 There is no fake news. You just divulged you big oil Trumpster origins. Do you receive monthly payments directly from Koch?  We’re all curious

655 2018-08-05 22:31:27 It’d be superb if Scotland would seize the initiative to go for hydrogen. It could be an entirely domestic based industry, free from rare elements like lithium we have no control over, and, like our oil industry, the expertise would be exportable.
656 2018-08-05 22:31:20 La hice una vez de noche. Casi me quedo sin nafta por no cargar en una oil. De ahi nunca mas
657 2018-08-05 22:31:20 STOP selling military hardware to Saudi Arabia. We don’t need their oil. We don’t need to support their extremist Wahhabi fundamentalism.

663 2018-08-05 22:30:18 We do get about 11% of our oil imports from there so that would mark a major shift.

Although that initial report cites 'new' trade.
664 2018-08-05 22:30:04 All we need is the price of oil to drop and Kevin will be happy with corporate raises. 
665 2018-08-05 22:29:51 So lets say russia helped Trump win...

How is Trump arming crimeans, strengthening Nato (funding) who Russia hate, and trying to undercut his one main source of income (gas) by Exporting American oil and planning on a pipeline to Europe....

I mean if thats him repaying putin..
666 2018-08-05 22:29:38 I’m sure you’d rather bend over to Saudi Arabia. I guess you like using oil that finds terrorism instead of Albertan oil.
667 2018-08-05 22:29:32 What does he know about it?
Oh, right, whatever his logging lobbies tell him and whatever big oil says.
668 2018-08-05 22:29:27 left a t&t receipt out for me for only grape seed oil and a synergy gRape drink. These people have no idea what I live through for them.

677 2018-08-05 22:28:30 No I didn't say it was running out but I will eventually it's strange u say oil is being stolen for wat u loose on every barrel and the SCOT GOV goes nothing to make up shortfall UK GOV does it

681 2018-08-05 22:28:02 That’s why I said I’m not against oil & gas. I’m all for producing meaningful products. EVs make perfect sense because of their efficiency versus ICE. No idling wasting gas for $2 Timmy’s in drive thru!

687 2018-08-05 22:27:36 They're being magnified because you and your ignorant pals ignore climate science and the dangers of climate change in exchange for bribes from the oil industry.
688 2018-08-05 22:27:27 Maybe this will end oil imports from there. So this is good.
689 2018-08-05 22:27:26 Reminder that California will be paying $250/barrel for oil within 5 years.  If you start now, you might only get away with a massive recession instead of a depression.  

/And Texas will be paying $50, but eh...
690 2018-08-05 22:27:21 Some cities in Germany ban older Diesel on certain streets or areas.

693 2018-08-05 22:27:10 I mostly use it in my diffuser, along with a citrus oil like lemon or grapefruit. It promotes a great calming effect when diffused. I have a toddler and an infant. So, it’s helpful when they get cranky close to nap or bedtime

700 2018-08-05 22:26:35 Exactly. I think both all Canadians should be on the same side here. We don’t want or need their oil that funds terrorism.

713 2018-08-05 22:24:32 Fine by me. They fund terrorists. They can keep their bloody oil also. We shouldn’t bend over backwards for them.
714 2018-08-05 22:24:31 Thanks. They're exporting $0.5 billion to EU of agricultural produce. It seems that much of this oil exported to EU, USA, MENA, will be mixed with other oils to raise the quality. The very high quality stuff, by the sounds, won't make it to EU, so might not be obvious from label.
715 2018-08-05 22:24:09 Someone remind me again where 15 of the men involved in 9/11 we're from? Afghanistan? Hmmm, I don't think that's it. 

I think it starts with an S.

Anyone? Anyone? Bueller...?

Canada doesn't need their oil.
716 2018-08-05 22:24:06 I keep getting pro pipeline ads on twitter. Like...you've seriously misunderstood my feelings on oil pipelines.
717 2018-08-05 22:24:04 is it considered speedballing if I drink this energy drink and wear my lavender oil at the same time
718 2018-08-05 22:24:03 I dropped my tea tree oil all over my bathroom floor  ughhh
719 2018-08-05 22:23:40 I make very few "recipes". I cook a meat or fish and sautee some vegetables in coconut oil or bacon grease.  Easy, peazy and very delicious.

721 2018-08-05 22:23:27 Pro-tip: pop one in the microwave for about 12 seconds before you eat it. It gets all hot and runny and the oil starts to separate out a little. It's like cheese goop. It's great.
722 2018-08-05 22:23:20 Good god.  And his cult will believe this.   Surprised he didnt say we need to drill for more oil in Cali to end the fires.   or is that what he wants with clearing the forests so they dont burn.   FFS.   
723 2018-08-05 22:23:17 He uses extra virgin olive oil. Of course this is third party hearsay.
724 2018-08-05 22:23:11 Just as Venezuela have found having oil is pointless if it can’t be sold for more than it cost to produce. Given oil needs are in decline and moreover with WE advent of EV  oil is a dead duck . Oh Scot gov spend the oil money on freebies. That’s where it’s went ! Baby boxes etc

732 2018-08-05 22:21:55 Under Maduro, Venezeula didn’t invest on the oil infrastructure. Even if they want to increase their production, they actually can’t and therefore they can’t sell.
733 2018-08-05 22:21:48 Perhaps if the dominant contribution of fossil fuel to CC was the narrative we heard, it would be a different story, but the plant-based-bullshit crowd and the oil companies seem to have a common interest in disinformation.
734 2018-08-05 22:21:18 The only country in the world that can't be independent cos it threatens the cushty life of a unionist, the only country in world with billions of barrels of oil that would be poor. Give me a frigging break from the absolute bs

Then, the US installed a democracy that led instantly to civil war that still isn't over. 

Why....

742 2018-08-05 22:20:34 our state is burning up & people are losing everything - it's a tragedy. If anything is a contributing factor, it is climate change. Bolstering your oil & gas friends is making it worse.
743 2018-08-05 22:20:14 You must not throw oil on the fire, Mr. Chairman
744 2018-08-05 22:20:13 try an oil based facial cleanser like Clean It Zero by Banilla Co. it seriously melts your eye & face make up off

749 2018-08-05 22:19:24 Congratulations on driving oil to $250 after the Saudis and Iranians go at it, because you're the only state that still imports oil, and you do it from the same supplies the Asians use.

I’m sorry to hear that, they say lucrative mining and oil but don’t take into account. Venezuela has a tremendously hard time getting equal revenue for equal products. It’s sad to see them hard pressed to survive.
761 2018-08-05 22:17:45 How can I believe you? Energy in Depth (EID) is a pro-oil-and-gas drilling industry front group formed by the American Petroleum Institute, the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA).

763 2018-08-05 22:17:33 World oil prices remain volatile. What would be the point of removing the hedge tax now, only to reimpose it later down the road when the market turns crazy again? We expect responsible administration of the country’s affairs from our leaders. No more reckless populist pandering!
764 2018-08-05 22:17:18 In large pot w/olive oil sauté onions, garlic & celery, choice of pepper (I also add mushrooms and bell pepper, add diced potatoes and sliced carrots, veggie broth and fire roasted tomatoes until boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30-40 min or until potatoes are tender.

768 2018-08-05 22:16:49 Yeah, straight up oil can change the consistency. You cut down on the amount used, to mitigate that. And for the flavor, you definitely don't want to use a strong flavored oil such as Mazola corn oil. That will make it taste "off" for sure.
769 2018-08-05 22:16:37 you asked if the garlic knots were made w oil or butter bc youre so italian not bc ur vegan
770 2018-08-05 22:16:20 You gotta roast it in the oven at high temp. Like 450. Lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, S & P. Yum.

773 2018-08-05 22:15:31 You’re the threat to humanity sir.  Just because someone isn’t buying the snake oil you’re selling, it doesn’t mean that they are fake.
774 2018-08-05 22:15:21 @cbcmarketplace If we are driving for longer periods between oil change we need to remember to check the oil level because oil does burn off -  I would preferred this be included in your report. Thanks anyway!!

787 2018-08-05 22:13:23 That doesn’t mean that zoning solves all those problems. Richmond CA is a perfect example-a low-income community being poisoned by proximity to an oil refinery.  And military bases are often a toxic stew.

798 2018-08-05 22:12:24 Lubricant: A substance which is used to reduce the friction between two surfaces, it is called as lubricant. Properties of an ideal lubricant are high boiling point, high viscosity index and corrosion prevention. Motor oil is an example of lubricant.
799 2018-08-05 22:12:20 Why has something that has been a medicine for centuries suddenly not a medicine as of 80yrs ago? Cannabis was only made illegal because hemp was going to make cotton, forest & oil industries lose money. Since then other industries that will lose money from hemp &/or weed joined
800 2018-08-05 22:11:58 Sure.  Lard.  Shortening.  Crisco makes a butter-flavored shortening.  But for some reason I thought oil - like canola or vegetable - might change the consistency.  I know it would definitely affect the flavor.

806 2018-08-05 22:10:30 In no way did I use hand out or imply that in my tweet.  I trying to imply that the oil companies,I don't discriminate between large and small, are the villains that laid off workers, no government, even the NDP, were responsible.

815 2018-08-05 22:09:29 @cbcmarketplace  thank you for the informative piece on oil change practices. It is important to note that many Canadian drivers do not know how to add oil when their vehicle is running low. So the  5k or 3M practice saves a people from a blown engine due to low or no oil.
816 2018-08-05 22:09:21 I broil in oven with a sprinkle of olive oil
817 2018-08-05 22:09:21 The European's are your allies and most of your population owes it's roots in Europe plus the biggest oil companies are from Europe, ie, Shell so you usually work together in desturbilizing governments ie, French army going into Libya to secure oil fields case in point

840 2018-08-05 22:04:25 Yeah, it's also possible to steal another countries oil reserves, keep quiet about it and end up broke when they eventually bugger off with said oil reserves (after more than 40 bloody years of squandering the revenue).
That's a lesson Unionists are about to learn.

848 2018-08-05 22:02:57 Hahahahaha. I agree that the US military is the largest single source of pollution in the world. It’s also not “unaccountable” because it’s run by a government, it’s unaccountable because our government has been *co-opted*. If there were no government BP would still b dumping oil
849 2018-08-05 22:02:57 Most fringe groups are like always chess pieces of CIA backing by funds and arms and intelligence. Largest oil reserves in the world can’t be in the hands of socialists wanting to nationalize it for social reform and infrastructure.

... so for climate alarm skeptics and blue collar / middle class, big oil remains almost as a big a 'foe' as SJW's, Sierra Club, etc.
856 2018-08-05 22:02:29 To even the odds, I believe the match should be conducted in a paddling pool full of baby oil. Preferably with clothe dissolving properties 
857 2018-08-05 22:02:13 test case: if 5/10 are employed w/ same high salary 2 yrs in a row = wage constancy.  But if 5/10 is then 9/10 the following year, but those new 4/10 have minimum wage oil jobs, then wages have declined, haven't they?  

Which seems to be this case... Do I have this wrong?
858 2018-08-05 22:02:01 "IN COUNTRY" It might be your country but you cannot treat those that serve you like shite. What would you have been without oil? How can you treat normal people with next to little rights.

862 2018-08-05 22:01:26 OR is this another fake claim like tt by Mahathir & UMNO Malays that even after 47 years of NEP (DEB), Malays/Bumiputras still do not own 30% equity of economy? With palm oil ranging from US$2,000-4,298 over 20 years, into whose pockets has all d $ gone? Govt must investigate!

872 2018-08-05 22:00:45 oh yeah definitely not castor oil. that seems a bit risky. but eating pineapple, walking, sex, dancing, nipple stimulation, etc. that's all just normal activities so it's worth trying lol

880 2018-08-05 21:59:56 The point about Venezuela is that it is possible to be rich in oil and to be bankrupt and have an economic crisis. That’s a lesson you Separatists should learn.

893 2018-08-05 21:57:02 Avocado oil is good, so would try the mayo. Oil tastes slightly of avocado, and has a 500F smoke point, if you care about such things.
894 2018-08-05 21:57:00 yes. I'm of Italian descent. Jack Woltz said I would make Johnny Fontane envious with my olive oil voice and guinea charm. 80-90 years ago I'd be fighting the Irish for a job.

895 2018-08-05 21:56:53 I used to eat popcorn for like 2 meals a day, and yes to the oil method but also! For light options a $20 air popper from bed bath and beyond combined with Pam spray and a popcorn salt=lordt
896 2018-08-05 21:56:51 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
897 2018-08-05 21:56:46 I also agree it's a money thing. but we have a president that has more money than he knows what to do with, & he's going to drill for oil in Nat parks & extinguish the endangered species act. so I really doubt he cares about Earth, unless people are informed enough to make him.
898 2018-08-05 21:56:39 No I was quoting Alex Salmond on that he wanted Scotland to be Europes Venezuela as oil was high then that worked out great just imagine now the queues of ppl trying to get out of Scotland had he won the argument he said it on record case u need to check multiple times

906 2018-08-05 21:55:21 Soybeans do not rot so quickly. No need for USA soy

China has several years of basic imports (wheat & rice, some edible oils like soybean oil) in storage as a hedge against famine.

977 2018-08-05 21:45:34 A great record Chris. The Oil on Canvas live album is very good as well. Sylvian's debut solo album is a personal favourite that I should really listen to again.
978 2018-08-05 21:44:31 Yes Bros because this your oil price falling to the price you mention when put to statistics will only take 20%max from 100% which makes it irrelevance in comparison... The fact is we made a lot during their ruling of this country and there was nothing to show for it
979 2018-08-05 21:44:31 That bums me out. I was really hoping to have the oil cooler plumbed today.

Amin.
987 2018-08-05 21:42:34 This family has made a life out of bending/breaking the law, cheating American/foreign workers/investors, doing biz with organized crime. They literally are “coastal elites” as a result. If irony was oil we’d be the richest nation in the world forever. #MAGA
988 2018-08-05 21:42:33 Never been invited to one...Kinda glad about that now
989 2018-08-05 21:42:26 Literally did it in about 30 min and most of the time I use a vinegar water and essential oil mix to cut through all the grease!
990 2018-08-05 21:42:12 I think I should rent  it all out and get in the oil business and say the hell with it
991 2018-08-05 21:42:10 What baby oil is great for the soul lol
992 2018-08-05 21:41:55 You didn't want wind farms off the coast, so you voted for oil rigs.
993 2018-08-05 21:41:50 Where's that, Charlie. I think she's the brains behind the groaner thing, not you. Funny, though. One event gone (Parade) one to go. Queen tribute band. Really been burning the midnight oil this weekend. Night nights.
994 2018-08-05 21:41:48 #Total: the French company's worldwide #oil and #gas production rose by 8.7% in the second quarter of 2018
995 2018-08-05 21:41:32 Smurf Ice Cream is made of 2 cups of cream, 1 cup of milk, 2 egg yolks, 1/2 cup of sugar, vanilla, raspberry, 1 spoon of lemon oil, and four smurfs.

996 2018-08-05 21:41:13 You said 16 years of peak oil price. That's wrong first of all. Of course PDP's 16 years was marred with corruption...and nothing much to show for it.. Another fact as well  is this APC's 3 years is worse...
997 2018-08-05 21:41:09 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
998 2018-08-05 21:41:09 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
999 2018-08-05 21:41:02 I have a knee injury and have been wondering if cbd oil or ointment would help. Did you try this by chance?
1000 2018-08-05 21:41:02 1) In spite of the very high oil prices then, what was the nation's Foreign Reserve? 
2) How much territory did Boko Haram capture? 
3) How many times did we experience fuel scarcity? 
4) What number was Nigeria on the list of most dangerous countries in the world?
1001 2018-08-05 21:40:57 I suppose it's lubricated with butter and not machine oil.
1002 2018-08-05 21:40:53 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.
1003 2018-08-05 21:40:51 Fun Fact about the #ableg climate plan. The Oil and Gas Industry helped @RachelNotley and the @albertaNDP create the carbon levy. Clearly you have chosen a side without considering all the facts
1004 2018-08-05 21:40:35 I know I know. I don't know where I come up w this stuff tbh

1009 2018-08-05 21:39:57 White, men, straight, god, oil, money, car, gun, bible, army, patriotism, republican, Fox news, Space Force, drain the swamp, MAGA, KAG, Trump....
1010 2018-08-05 21:39:44 I step aside,
he feels the air with his soft tongue,
around the bones of his body he moves like oil,
downhill he goes
toward the black mirrors of the pond.
1011 2018-08-05 21:39:42 confirmed: leading therapists confirm that once DonaldTrump starts whining, a member of congress assumes he is winning #tiredofwinning
1012 2018-08-05 21:39:34 Address the problem of killings by looking at killers?

I dunno: that sounds too.... sensible.
1013 2018-08-05 21:39:33 Analytics or baby oil?
1014 2018-08-05 21:39:33 The oil smells like heaven too
1015 2018-08-05 21:39:25 Well behaved weekend at home.

Need to remember to work out assorted recipes tomorrow and buy cooking oil.

Still convinced I'm going to forget the lot irrespective of how many reminders I set.
1016 2018-08-05 21:39:05 It's big oil that was the most heavily invested in carbon trading. The Guardian ! That left wing rag. Gawd, They also predicted we'd run out of oil in the 70's they called it the production Bell curve. We are now swimming in the stuff.
1017 2018-08-05 21:39:05 All of our gas and oil in Vancouver island come by barge, natural gas by pipeline, while do have an excellent site for a dam in the island,  pretty much all our electricity comes from the mainland via 3 separate cable systems, one these is listed as obsolete.
1018 2018-08-05 21:38:25 oil & spank show tonight! logging on @ 8pm latest. 
get your 2tk offline spanks in 
i am excited to hang xo
1019 2018-08-05 21:38:16 They control the oil.
1020 2018-08-05 21:38:09 Let someone else do it. This is the attitude shown by Canada's government. Their plan is to increase oil production and emissions while pretending to be climate leaders. It's disgusting and so are those groups that support them.
1021 2018-08-05 21:37:36 Go to your boyfriends house to change your oil, problem solved
1022 2018-08-05 21:37:29 Exactly.  I use the grill, and I actually like to use a cast iron skillet at the end.  Tip though coat your steak with olive oil so it doesn’t dry out.  1 1/4” ribeyes work best.
1023 2018-08-05 21:37:19 Say, what ever happened to all that oil we stole from poor Saddam?  I could use some of that.  Yeah we Conservatives are BIG FANS of Statism...the more and bigger government the better we always say....
1024 2018-08-05 21:37:15 Except you can't just "pick up a gun" in another state.
1025 2018-08-05 21:37:07 I hate baby oil  but I might need to invest in some
1026 2018-08-05 21:36:53 I really don't see how it's stupid in relation to the original question, "Why can't the world leave Venezuela alone?" The world wants Venezuela's oil. I never said that they and anything to do with the civil unrest, though I guess I can see how it can be read that way.

1031 2018-08-05 21:35:48 I don't actually know what otters smell like. Is it a similar mustelid odor, but with more wet oil?
1032 2018-08-05 21:35:42 Finally a oil change 
1033 2018-08-05 21:35:37 aug5. active yang flow. think big! favorable time to create & build: art, relationships, business, structures. toss away few things you don't use. indulge in food – body can use some extra nourishing. exercise a lot. avoid drinking too much liquids.
add blend No4 to massage oil.

1039 2018-08-05 21:34:55 Guess the fundies who lost their shorts on Tesla might try recouping their loses on oil majors? @OBenPotter
1040 2018-08-05 21:34:44 bicth! i went to walmart to get an oil change and i had my her album on and Serendipity was playing and it was like 5 seconds into the song  before i turned my car off and i did that on purpose so the people changing my oil  would hear the sweet sound of jimins voice
1041 2018-08-05 21:34:19 Imagine sitting in a bathtub and that bathtub is on roller skates and the floor is made out of ice coated in olive oil. Now you know how it feels to pilot a ship in No Man's Sky using keyboard and mouse.
1042 2018-08-05 21:34:07 Groceries!

But should I get some avocado oil for my millenial food cooking? 
1043 2018-08-05 21:33:23 The fact that it flew north across Oil City Road and continued. means that it left Liberty Marsh, the only place in Wallkill NWR that its been reported to my knowledge.  The observation platform is on the S side of Oil City Road and in NY territory.
1044 2018-08-05 21:33:20 Wash with olive oil soap, tone with rose water and moisturize with hemp/rosehip oil
1045 2018-08-05 21:33:19 He's almost right where he wants to be...Pence. is one of his boys..Koch's dad made fortune with NAZIS and oil refinery. .Stalin and Russia. Oil refineries. .

1049 2018-08-05 21:32:52 @Laura88Lee Just noticed my LLLA liquid lipsticks have been leaking oil.. I store them laying down in an acrylic drawer.. Is it recommended to store them upright only?
1050 2018-08-05 21:32:51 Seriously the BEST banana bread ever! Made with apple sauce in place of butter/oil- always turns out perfect. 

If anyone would like recipe let me know 
1051 2018-08-05 21:32:35 You don’t want to overpower the meat though innit. The chillis’ natural oil does the job!
1052 2018-08-05 21:32:26 They’re going to be auctioned off in September for Charity, I believe the City Bee doesn’t have any former players on it, pity it’s not covered in Oil and is on top of a yellow banana
1053 2018-08-05 21:31:44 I legit just washed all of my clothes and baby K. Clothes i showered got dressed and spilled oil all over my fresh clean shirt  really are you serious
1054 2018-08-05 21:31:36 Yes oil price at its peak and before you go further with linking my comment to this present government...am sure you didn't see in anywhere where I linked the problem of this govt to oil price but am sure you also know how much the country made from sales of crude oil then
1055 2018-08-05 21:31:33 Luckily I have my oil pen on me but can it fast forward to 9pm please.
1056 2018-08-05 21:31:31 As low as 25 dollars? Oil was benchmarked(budget) at 40 dollar and oil was selling in excess of 40 dollar, remember the excess crude account at that time?  Check your facts before you tweet sir.
1057 2018-08-05 21:31:28 Oil based ! 
1058 2018-08-05 21:31:28 Sheesh  wearing baby oil prevents mosquitoes from biting you too
1059 2018-08-05 21:31:27 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.
1060 2018-08-05 21:31:24 If Italy is committed to genuine transition in Libya, and not just in it for the oil and control, provide logistical/technical support to groups who continue to pursue and hunt IS militants in Libya. Invest in Libya's future and then they may be gracious to you.
1061 2018-08-05 21:31:23 Oil would be nice and I think  damn you questioning my mini fantasy
1062 2018-08-05 21:31:23 Do you recall obama saying "the jobs will NEVER come back so I want to know what magic wand Trump has" well the jobs are back and so is our economy; also Trump gave FLINT 100M to fix the filtration;ALSO TRUMP BANNED OIL COMING FROM THE MIDDLE EAST GLOBALLY!!!OBAMA DIDNT!
1063 2018-08-05 21:31:16 end of what, we just started bro.... The amount of crude oil Nigeria exports daily is unknown

NNPC still don't open its financial books for scrutiny

The reintroduced fuel subsidy is gulping billions of Naira monthly 

TSA is not applicable to NNPC
Buba is redefining corruption
1064 2018-08-05 21:31:07 Just pointing out the stupidity of your original tweet. Your either 1) Stating that people only care about the crisis  because they have oil or 2) That it's external actors not Venezuela's own policies that caused it
1065 2018-08-05 21:30:40 That’s just it they don’t. It’s all about corporate nepotism, deregulation, and of one looks closer with tariffs, deregulation including some of Exxon mobiles holdings with oil in Siberia, tariffs, and of course our change in behavior in Syria it all benefits Putin.

1068 2018-08-05 21:30:23 It’s a must that I shampoo, deep condition, and hot oil treat my hair.
1069 2018-08-05 21:30:18 It is good oil. But at what cost. 

The only reason to intervene, in my opinion, is if China decides to float their economy with Belt and Road initiatives.
1070 2018-08-05 21:30:16 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
1071 2018-08-05 21:30:08 Never did until I cooked with it. You need the oil or it will dry out.
1072 2018-08-05 21:30:07 two muslim stereotypes I want to die:

- rich asshole mysogynist oil sheikh tycoon, being his son is optional
1073 2018-08-05 21:29:23 I feel like I’m getting sick, but that black seed oil, said naw baby.
1074 2018-08-05 21:29:09 Who gave somebody the right to make an oil change $75
1075 2018-08-05 21:29:01 As my health gets better and I take better care of myself my skin is recovering.

I give myself face mask treatments & got myself nice soaps and oil.

I really like this phase of my life 
1076 2018-08-05 21:28:55 Yes. 

But they  are short sighted and think only about oil.

1082 2018-08-05 21:27:50 Yes like Big Oil drilling and piping oil and Fracking - they all promise not to pollute but always do.
1083 2018-08-05 21:27:38 whats the product if you dont mind sharing??? my skin is naturally oil and its been out of whack since the heat :-(

1086 2018-08-05 21:27:16 おはようございます、寝苦しくて三時間で目が覚めた(混乱)
1087 2018-08-05 21:27:15 nationalize the oil industry
1088 2018-08-05 21:27:05 Nigerian billionaires should invest in CableTV business, everything is not OIL. It is almost a monopoly market for South Africa
1089 2018-08-05 21:27:05 the third option is paradigm change. right now, no one votes oil companies out of existence, because they don't know they can. once we realize that government is not some passive partner to corporations, the flood gates will open.

1092 2018-08-05 21:26:40 Bio Oil may be my new favourite skincare product 
1093 2018-08-05 21:26:38 Can you settle an argument? If you put CBD oil in your tea will it work faster? And better?

Thought?
1094 2018-08-05 21:26:36 i will never be able to get behind the essential oil trend lol my mom tbought it would cure my depression/ anxiety
1095 2018-08-05 21:26:08 I thought US is buying cheap oil from Canada and exporting theirs. What is wrong to do with cheaper trade ?
1096 2018-08-05 21:26:06 I don't think anyone knows what will and won't help (re: gun control) - what we need is to study what causes ppl to rampage and come up w a plan from there.
1097 2018-08-05 21:25:49 You find oneself licking one's 42 incher, as one squeals with glee, seeing one's lady-garden-drenchingly gorgeous @DoctorChristian on Dr Christian Will See You Now on Really. [One prays he's ready for a nude dame with baby oil & nipple clamps] *swoon* x x
1098 2018-08-05 21:25:43 Nice recipe, I would not advise the use of olive oil. Instead use coconut oil. Olive oil is best used in cold/warm foods and should not be baked nor fried. Carcinogenic under high heat.
1099 2018-08-05 21:25:38 the menu for the day is a half a loaf of rosemary olive oil bread from sprouts, and two mint yerba mates
1100 2018-08-05 21:25:29 & use anointing oil.
1101 2018-08-05 21:25:24 After 2 months of no MCT oil and having bulletproof coffee from @grouchyjohns , things are taking affect. @joerogan #bulletproofcoffee #mctOil. @TaitFletcher can't find caveman coffee anywhere in #Vegas
1102 2018-08-05 21:25:23 I love how you Americans use the word "Freedom" so loosely when you're after somebody else's resources, we all know you're after the countries oil resources and your government will create war, misery and distruction to serve narrow minded ideals of profit
1103 2018-08-05 21:25:11 You have to be careful the type of essential oils you use in your diffuser. A few drops of the wrong oil and your entire face will like it's burning off.......my current situation.

1104 2018-08-05 21:24:18 Oregano oil really helps me. Ordered it from Amazon.
1105 2018-08-05 21:24:15 my general rule of thumb at this point is oil in the fridge unless it's gonna be used very quickly.
1106 2018-08-05 21:24:15 Sure, he is “protecting” Putin so much that Mattis wiped out an entire Russian force in Syria, Trump has been trying to get NATO countries to beef up THEIR defense, and he tried to get Merkel to scuttle her oil pipeline deal with Russia in favor of American oil.
1107 2018-08-05 21:24:08 Anyone know what I could use on my ears for keloids on my lobes? I’m currently using vitamin e oil and peroxide
1108 2018-08-05 21:24:05 In exchange for exclusive oil and gas resources management for the next 50 years... OK, you got a deal.  Make Venezuela Capiltalist Again!
1109 2018-08-05 21:23:59 That would be good for the price of oil.
1110 2018-08-05 21:23:55 People are literally killing themselves bc they have been cut off. If that doesn't speak loud enough words, then nothing will.

1113 2018-08-05 21:22:54 Brother.... Is not like I don't know this for a fact but Walahi I was amused to my bonemarrow as to his level of confidence listing GSM, AMNESTY, BAG OF RICE PRICE, OIL PRICE as an achievement of a party that ruled this country at the time the country was earning good money
1114 2018-08-05 21:22:53 I’ve been panicking that I put too much tea tree oil in my shampoo and now my scalp lowkey hurts.. is this all in my head or did I really put too much in??? I read that you can lose hair and shit if you put too much in
1115 2018-08-05 21:22:34 @IkejaElectric how far ,since yesterday no light,na Una papa get the light?
1116 2018-08-05 21:22:31 It was awful. I felt like the parents were just auctioning off their teens to oil tycoons.
1117 2018-08-05 21:22:24 Coconut oil!!!
1118 2018-08-05 21:22:04 The people think that Donald Trump actually pulls the strings in the white house he's just a puppet gas and oil companies say what goes and he just signs the paper people really think that the president has to say when that's not the case
1119 2018-08-05 21:21:58 Oil price at it's peak? Don't troll yourselves o. Go check what oil price was under Obasanjo.. (as low as 25 dollars) and you will quickly realise that APC's/Buhari's problem is not oil price majorly. It's incompetence.
1120 2018-08-05 21:21:54 Someone who works in the oil and gas industry on drilling rigs.
1121 2018-08-05 21:21:32 2/3 She led U on the entire time, it sounded like a great opportunity for you.
This coming out of the blue, was to good to be true. She used famous names to impress you.
This was the American version of the Nigerian oil scams. Also her spelling/grammar, stunk
1122 2018-08-05 21:21:17 Spelling is racist.
1123 2018-08-05 21:21:17 Adios. Only honest people can become citizens
1124 2018-08-05 21:21:10 There was a massive oil explosion at the industrial depot near to where I live (buncefield explosion 2005?) those 5 days off school I began my scraping career killing goblins and selling all drops to the general store for GP 
1125 2018-08-05 21:20:58 @Walmart you need to do something about the speed of your workers at Walmart on El Dorado in Friendswood in the TLE. When I worked here it didn't take 2 hours to do an oil change, I'm probably going to be late to work thanks to your current team here.

1129 2018-08-05 21:20:20 Could you just listen to yourself and look at your list of achievement again for a government that ruled when the country made so much from selling of oil.... 

GSM 
AMNESTY
BAG OF RICE
OIL PRICE

Not having exposure is a disease just like illetracy
1130 2018-08-05 21:20:11 Not exactly woodworking, but a little attention to a beat up cutting board can go a long way. Started with 80 grit - ended at 220. Don't forget to clean your paper in between - makes it lat longer. Then a bit of mineral oil to bring her back to almost new.
1131 2018-08-05 21:20:10 holy moly somebody drop some oil
1132 2018-08-05 21:20:05 extra virgin olive oil?
1133 2018-08-05 21:19:59 8/5/1882- Standard Oil of New Jersey founded.
1134 2018-08-05 21:19:52 Data is the new oil. Tech corporations pretty much using goverments as a civil service.
1135 2018-08-05 21:19:52 i love having birds bc that means I can't use microwaved popcorn which gives me an excuse to make a whole pot full of coconut oil popcorn WHICH IS SUCH A BLESSING TO THIS WORLD
1136 2018-08-05 21:19:25 The Bay of Fundy has millions & millions of liters of foreign oil floating into it weekly from foreign countries. Why use our own more safely???
1137 2018-08-05 21:19:19 What did you expect? Using the same diction as hard-boiled racists isn't a bright idea, neither will it solve any problem or make the discourse more civilized. You're just pouring oil in the fire of shouting and hating people that are different.
1138 2018-08-05 21:19:10 Congrats on a good weekend.
1139 2018-08-05 21:19:10 Keep going with chicken and tuna in water (not brine or oil). Vet for checkup, deworming, flea treatment and chip checker. Good luck! X
1140 2018-08-05 21:19:00 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
1141 2018-08-05 21:18:36 Well then. Just drink some oil and raw egg and shake ur body! There's nothing better than fresh scramble egg in-side ur body!
1142 2018-08-05 21:18:25 Don’t they have a history of money laundering with very little internal controls? But those oil sands tho.......
1143 2018-08-05 21:18:11 He is Corbyn's idol who has bankrupted an oil rich country, " Venezuela ",  you couldn't make it up, you've been warned.
1144 2018-08-05 21:17:56 Try hemp oil it legal don't need a prescription and does Not get you high
1145 2018-08-05 21:17:54 Una head get oil for Una company o 
1146 2018-08-05 21:17:49 Why is the West, especially the United States not intervening in countries like the DRC but are quick to do so in Venezuela, is it because they have oil there and not in other countries? Look at what they've done to Libya, where there's war Western powers make profit in misery!
1147 2018-08-05 21:17:36 I don't sprinkle hot oil anyone, that's just uncalled for. If I'll sprinkle anything on him it will be the blood of Jesus and all this love I have in my very big heart 
1148 2018-08-05 21:17:34 Am I the only person worrying about grease and oil getting on the sofa? 
1149 2018-08-05 21:17:33 Who had cod liver oil ?
1150 2018-08-05 21:17:33 i followed you for ass not snake oil whats going on here
1151 2018-08-05 21:17:28 Which employees are those? The ones who are loyal--to oil rigs, cows, & trophies--or the disloyal ones who value endangered species?
1152 2018-08-05 21:17:16 Chef Gusteau cut up some carrots, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with toast.

1154 2018-08-05 21:16:22 ..... I mean I got what you meant lmao y’all just gon rub titties? Is oil involved? Will things escalate?
1155 2018-08-05 21:16:13 The vast majority of coal, oil and natural gas is domestically (US) produced. For me that is not a dubious/insecure source. It’s very comforting to be energy independent.
1156 2018-08-05 21:16:05 why isn't "quid pro quo" being discussed in this? I don't see anything mentioning the Rosneft oil deal quid pro quo re: lifting of sanctions if Russia provides help. The quid pro quo issue should not be overlooked in this.  Also, I see nothing about money laundering via the NRA.
1157 2018-08-05 21:15:49 Because no matter how great our schools are, the interests of Capital always win over the interests of altruistic IR wonks & working class voters.

That’s why our 2 most recent SoS’s have been an oil executive & one of Charles Koch’s puppets.
1158 2018-08-05 21:15:46 Whip together 1/3 cup babaganoosh with 9 tsps Cantaloupe. Blend with Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve in 3 inch slices
1159 2018-08-05 21:15:28 I feel for him sha.
Cos you look like the type that'll sprinkle hot oil on someone's son and say "i just wanted to see if it's hot enough"
1160 2018-08-05 21:15:20 Get the cold towels and the halibut oil ready...Hindy's gonna need it!

1165 2018-08-05 21:14:46 So how do you suggest we by oil and other products from other countries? Why should they take our printed money with nothing to back it?
1166 2018-08-05 21:14:28 World:

Iran/Iraq on the cusp of revolution.
China continues to buy oil from Iran.
China building concentration camps for minorities.

1167 2018-08-05 21:14:18 Put some oil on ur stomach and make some scramble egg
1168 2018-08-05 21:13:53 Oil Ocean Act 2 was also my hardest.  My favourite was easily Press Garden Act 2.  Loved those Shinobi game sound effects!
1169 2018-08-05 21:13:48 For sure. I'm just not sure about the evolutionary argument. Following the logic, should we *credit* flour, sugar, and seed oil for the new generation of ppl living past 85 that never did before?
1170 2018-08-05 21:13:42 Some kid at the smoke shop tried to explain an oil burner to me. I don’t even understand how to get high anymore.
1171 2018-08-05 21:13:27 #Rapeseed oil. It's far superior. 
1172 2018-08-05 21:13:17 I'm looking into a few different oils next. Jojoba for topical; and two others for ingestible; Algae Oil, and a blend (Safflower-Avacado-Coconut). (Just ordered some more Red Lion PC60)
1173 2018-08-05 21:12:41 Wil you just calm down for a while! Drink palm oil or water it will help

1177 2018-08-05 21:12:25 Dog what lmao RT @MynameisMcFly: Coconut oil sex is also top 5
1178 2018-08-05 21:12:14 Yes I did.  And this is correct, if I was a CEO I'd run faster than me going to mom's for her famous banana bread!
1179 2018-08-05 21:12:09 Oh, no! Thank you for the discount code, however, I already placed my order of 2 bottles/standard CBD oil with you which have been delivered to my mum’s address (post code RM12 6QB). Would you, therefore, kindly let me use this discount code when I place my next order with you?
1180 2018-08-05 21:12:03 The only involvement anyone has is media reporting on the crisis. You think they'r doing so because of the oil and not because people are starving to death ?
1181 2018-08-05 21:11:59 
خب پس برو گم شو
1182 2018-08-05 21:11:52 It’s so great! I love using that or avocado oil. They both have high smoke points. 
1183 2018-08-05 21:11:22 put walnuts, olive oil, and avocado in salad and my body ejected me straight into ketosis. im definitely a better person now
1184 2018-08-05 21:10:51 Did you read the report which says that  insiders are selling their shares at an unprecedented rate . Smells like we are on a top
1185 2018-08-05 21:10:38 Sure, being omnivores, I am sure that we can eat almost anything as a species. Some people get obese and sick though, and if they eat grass-fed steaks and donuts, I’ll blame the flour, sugar and seed oil rather than the ruminant meat. In line with evolutionary past.
1186 2018-08-05 21:10:36 Don't rubbish me while your country can't even contain a terrorist organisation within...cant give you fuel despite you having oil ...You are inherently corrupt
1187 2018-08-05 21:10:34 No they have not, they have benefited like when China gave us old grain and people were poisoned. And the oil deal with Russia is a disaster

1193 2018-08-05 21:09:54 The grocery store was a madhouse but I bought what I needed. The chicken is now marinating in a mix of soy sauce, oil, brown sugar, red pepper flakes, and a bit of garlic powder. It will make good mini sandwiches with the Hawaiian rolls.
1194 2018-08-05 21:09:51 A graduate listed GSM as one of PDP archievement after ruling the country for 16 solid years when the price of oil at the international market was at it's peak
1195 2018-08-05 21:09:49 Per the instructions, this morning I added baking powder, sugar, vanilla, eggs, milk and vegetable oil to my “pancake mix.”

1200 2018-08-05 21:09:16 man, if innovative governance was a #thing we would totally nationalize oil.because climate change, because US Military carbon footprint could probably halve the costs of transport, so many savings, just ike medicare for all.  Industry for consumers, not for profiteers. #SAD
1201 2018-08-05 21:09:12 CAUTION FOR FUCK SAKE THERES OIL ON TRACK
1202 2018-08-05 21:09:03 what if pdp takes us back on d little we've accomplished under dis admin, what if it becomes worse? 16 years ago wen we had everything, oil price high etc nd wat did dey do? buhari came in our toughest moments do u think 4 years will solve our problems created by 16 years of pdp?

1210 2018-08-05 21:07:47 China and Russia have done nothing but help Iran, Ignoring sanctions, making oil deals, sending in trains, investing in the economy and Russia is protecting Iranians in Syria
1211 2018-08-05 21:07:46 @eminem my Dad served in Navy first, then a paratrooper in Army,Advanced wing stamped in The Air Force, retired in 77' now in Heaven  since 97..there is no "collateral damage" from blood spilled over oil in a can or takeover of land, can't wash his hands from the dirt u do. Truth
1212 2018-08-05 21:07:35 no war for oil? when was this taken? who's been hanging on to this image?... re elect Gore?
1213 2018-08-05 21:07:19 Today Collin discovered the magic of massage oil and safe to say we’re both pretty darn satisfied with the results 
1214 2018-08-05 21:07:16 i bet this guy is using that oil they have been talking about lately!!
1215 2018-08-05 21:07:13 That fact that it's even a possibility, though, is pretty extraordinary. I think it indicates that many "modern diets," provided they aren't just excess amounts of highly processed sugar/oil/carbs, are actually terrific in most cases.
1216 2018-08-05 21:07:02 Kind of pointless having it in one state when you can just go actors state lines, pick up a gun and drive back.
1217 2018-08-05 21:06:44 Uneasy or Cheap Oil?? So much for Paris Accord when money is at stake. No wonder #45 calls out the EU, two faced politicians
1218 2018-08-05 21:06:36 We all know that your farm staff are no longer paid by the Govt, your oil block will not be renewed, your boys are flush out of this govt.  we can understand your frustration it’s no longer business as usual. Don’t forget you can’t even win your polling unit. What a pity
1219 2018-08-05 21:06:28 Need my oil changed but it’s just way too hot
1220 2018-08-05 21:06:22 He did that not out of concern for anybody other than his buddies in Big Pharma. He also opened the door for every quack, huckster, conman and snake oil salesmen in the country. A room I am certain he’ll be right at home in.

Just doing away with rules and regs is often unwise.
1221 2018-08-05 21:05:47 I would say 3 aspects: dairy, oil, and processed foods/refined foods/fast foods which have become ubiquitous in Indian households. That and a heaping dose of sugar. That's why I ask Indian patients "What did your grandma/pa eat?" the answer is usually very informative.
1222 2018-08-05 21:05:39 Sorry James! You’re deluded or one of the snake oil sales people from your party! Our Country is losing its credibility, while your party is imploding and your leader has no idea what she’s doing = I pray for you as I pray for all those people who have 2 go 2 food banks!
1223 2018-08-05 21:05:34 نه یکم بیشتر حرف بزنم
1224 2018-08-05 21:05:23 Hm. Maybe use coconut oil?
Idk, I’ve had to shave for a couple years now but it did take a while for my skin to get used to it.
1225 2018-08-05 21:05:20 I read somewhere that vegetable oil ain't good for you
1226 2018-08-05 21:04:59 maybe try olive oil and herbs?? like rosemary or chives
1227 2018-08-05 21:04:16 What is fake butter? I’m guessing vegetable oil...? Or is it that Crisco stuff I’ve heard about?
1228 2018-08-05 21:04:13 Well so are we cos we've spent money we've earnt. We're not bank rolled by oil. We don't ruin football by paying extortionate wages. Where do you think the money comes from?
1229 2018-08-05 21:04:06 Buzzing on CBD oil 
1230 2018-08-05 21:04:04 The only thing that ever helped me was taking Oil of Evening Primrose regularly but even then I whacked my hubby with the wok one evening when he laughed at me! 
1231 2018-08-05 21:04:03 I’d place my bet on the dairy. Not the oil. Look at the Mediterranean diet to compare.
1232 2018-08-05 21:04:01 A 3rd-rate “Has Been” joining forces with a 3rd-rate s#ithole with oil - Perfect!
1233 2018-08-05 21:03:58 Sigh. Guess I will just keep applying my organic castor oil to my lashes then 
1234 2018-08-05 21:03:54 love when i’m tanning & lil bugs drown in oil when they land on me. #sorrysuckas
1235 2018-08-05 21:03:32 Precisely, they went into buybacks like always smfdh.  And this happens before every stock crash too usually bar 2006 where tax cut was much earlier
1236 2018-08-05 21:03:22 A levy of $1/tonne on coal and the same per barrel of oil might be a good place to start.
1237 2018-08-05 21:03:15 Snake oil con man. Your kid going to need a cell buddy.
1238 2018-08-05 21:03:11 I have never tried CBD ...I usually smoke some flower to fall asleep....I want to try CBD...do you use the liquid ? Can you vape CBD oil?
1239 2018-08-05 21:02:55 5. 1973. Oil Crisis. Carrero Blanco terrorist bombing in Madrid.
6. The Spanish King is Petro-Arabs personal friend- so no oil problem.
7. There was no Israel Embassy in Spain,  established 30 years ago.

1241 2018-08-05 21:02:51 As a Canadian now living in the US, I’m pretty sure there isn’t much to boycott. Canadian bacon is peameal bacon and not an import. We grow blueberries, apples, soy and corn here too. Oil sands oil isn’t cost effective. They can keep Celine and take back Bieber. 
1242 2018-08-05 21:02:25 Tax cuts were meant to raise capital expenditure of companies and increase wages and employment but I think the purpose has been defeated

1246 2018-08-05 21:02:06 For a solid hour at Brent's parents' house this morning, I thought we were watching the film Lorenzo's Oil, starring Susan Sarandon, when we were actually watching the film The Client, starring Susan Sarandon.
1247 2018-08-05 21:01:54 Things I've tried to use today to battle a migraine: prescription migraine meds, prescription pain meds, heat, ice, essential oils, caffeine, water, benadryl, and cbd oil #livingwithfibro #fibromialgia #migraine
1248 2018-08-05 21:01:51 A bit dated data; I forgot to mention earlier: Prudhoe Bay in AK is actually a huge gas field - it just happened to have over 14B barrels of oil there, too! Once the pipeline is below the low flow economics case, AK can build a pipeline for gas... 
1249 2018-08-05 21:01:45 Reading again, plenty of blame is put on the oil industry and GOP in the epilogue. I don't think the prologue is meant to stand on its own, independent of everything that follows. At the very least you have to read prologue and epilogue together.
1250 2018-08-05 21:01:38 Have you tried making your own “sun dried tomatoes” bung a few on a baking tray. Drizzle with olive oil and herbs, put in a low oven and they are like sweeties. You may have to google for exact instructions.
1251 2018-08-05 21:01:34 Okay now I get.
1252 2018-08-05 21:01:22 Phoebe Fung is calling in from Calgary, Alta. She used to be an executive in the oil and gas industry. Now she runs a business selling wine.

"I don't think I ever made less money but had more fun."
1253 2018-08-05 21:01:19 Use castor oil <33
1254 2018-08-05 21:01:06 you think the 1% is going to let the american people nationalize the oil industry? now that production is surpassing the saudis? that's what china, the saudis, norway and the richest countries do.  just to get out our $20T debt maybe? 
this is not democracy for the majority.

1256 2018-08-05 21:00:52 Uh... good thing I don't think it's okay then.

On that note, if it's your think to squirt baby oil, go nuts. If you don't take a picture, I won't take that away from you.
1257 2018-08-05 21:00:36 @realDonaldTrump oil independence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1258 2018-08-05 21:00:35 The oil in Iran was extracted by law by a private company (BP). Iran nationalized these oil fields and seized it from BP (viva socialism). Then came embargoes, unrest in Iran and the overthrow. Many factors, all parties share the blame, not just CIA.

1262 2018-08-05 21:00:11 August 05, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1263 2018-08-05 21:00:08 Next DoFo will say gas minimum will be $1.10 a litre, and urge the oil companies<<UGE eye roll here>> to compete to get it down there.  AS IF!

1265 2018-08-05 20:59:23 Such a perfect box item. Headed on three trips this month so the timing was on point. AND that @oseamalibu oil...OMG.
1266 2018-08-05 20:59:12 See what an educated person listed as dividend of democracy under a party that govern the country for 16 good years of solid and constant income from sales of oil.

You now wonder why how politicians take us for a fool?

1270 2018-08-05 20:58:43 @chefmarcela I made a new salad dish tonight.  Influences of Latin America. Why do many of the salads call for mayo/avocado/oil? It's never much but I guess the health conscious might say it's an over load.  It's delish - just curious for future kitchen adventures.
1271 2018-08-05 20:58:35 forget oil, the beauty blender industry is absolutely this generations gold mine
1272 2018-08-05 20:58:31 ...what the fuck is beard oil?
1273 2018-08-05 20:58:20 apparently putting a mix caster oil and coconut oil on it every day helps it grow there’s youtube vids on it and stuff
1274 2018-08-05 20:58:14 Same for me, depends on the ambient temperature and type. A high tannin or fusil oil wine (google it) gives me a banging head in the morning if I drink a bottle (who doesn’t). A reasonable Cabernet Sauvignon for me is fine.

"Just lay down and tell me where to go."

1276 2018-08-05 20:58:12 Its already started, I’ve spent weeks looking for british olive oil, but its nowhere to be seen, and the big supermarkets conveniently claim they never stocked such a product. But at least I’ve started stockpiling cheddar. Those damn import queues wont stop me enjoying my cheese
1277 2018-08-05 20:58:07 I'm really looking forward to my immersion blending arriving. Going to use it to make mayo (cup of olive oil, 1 egg) to enjoy with my cabbage salad with spices for lunches.

1282 2018-08-05 20:57:31 lol the protein powder that I bought says it was processed in a facility that also handles fish/crustaceans and shellfish oil weeeeeelllll that’s being returned
1283 2018-08-05 20:57:28 Oil and water dont mix. Integrity ke for where?
1284 2018-08-05 20:57:27 Almost eat anythingice block and palm oil
1285 2018-08-05 20:57:24 Lol "stock human" comes with happiness followed by anxiety. Factory joints are good for maybe 40 years. Oil pump with eradic pressures.. memory degradation over time.. can I get the upgraded package next time?
1286 2018-08-05 20:57:14 I ask sha for some oil in church ‘ why this bitch actually pull some out her purse .
1287 2018-08-05 20:57:00 Definitely. There will be a time when oil is almost irrelevant. We need to use that wealth to prepare for the future.
1288 2018-08-05 20:56:53 Ja, begint erg te lijken op die "labs" opgezet door big tobacco en big oil. Je weet dat een sector de maatschappij een loer aan het draaien is als ze zelf beginnen mee te denken over hun negatieve impact.
1289 2018-08-05 20:56:46 I AM A WITCH!!!!!!

i mixed my peppermint essential oil with my chocolate chip cookie essential oil anD NOW MY ROOM SMELLS DELICIOUS AF LIKE MINT CHOC CHIP HOLY FUCK!!!!
1290 2018-08-05 20:56:40 Yes...I have had a warm oil body slide massage...the sensual feeling of boobs and pussy slipping & sliding sexily over my whole body if very erotic and highly recommended...once you have tried it you will be back for more
1291 2018-08-05 20:56:37 It was two bottles of vinegar and a bottle of oil. If you must know. And I was trying to do a cleanse on my body since I had so little to eat. But thank you for noticing it and pointing it out

1293 2018-08-05 20:56:07 Socialism doesn't make anything fair, it eradicates liberty and kills those it purports to be for. Evidence free? GDP growth then & now, SME numbers (tomorrow's GDP), unemployment, youth unemployment, bond crisis, economic stagnation, slowest growth since 1974 oil crisis - more?
1294 2018-08-05 20:56:02 What oil regime do you use.... 
1295 2018-08-05 20:55:43 its mainly used as lube to keep from scratching the parts that are still good. you want the more fine, less coarse type of steel wool which, with the oil, will remove some rust without damaging the metal's finish
1296 2018-08-05 20:55:19 I get a kick out of news events... I see an auto accident where some are killed in the morning...  About 9 hours later the news CASTORS (as in oil) are out in force at night .... LIVE FROM NEW YORK... Do not pay attention to the traditional news.
1297 2018-08-05 20:55:15 Isn't your organic beard oil a little...soyboy?
1298 2018-08-05 20:54:56 smoking out the airport coz our maintenence man was away all last week so our chicken&fish station oil didn't get changed for ages went bad
1299 2018-08-05 20:54:43 I get the time thing. It's why I bulk and freeze. Blender takes 10 pulses ish. Then you just bind with some form of oil and crumbs. (My recipe says butter and crackers but meh.) Then they freeze and you just use as you feel. I make about 80 each time I do and then eat for days.
1300 2018-08-05 20:54:31 "we as a society.. we don't know that much, so we have to turn to these industry giants you know like OIL to tell us and remind us what's important"
1301 2018-08-05 20:54:22 But yeah. Grandpa! After my mom died my brothers & I agreed that the large (mid century, competent but good lord, no, just no) oil portrait of our dad as a young executive had to go. Always wondered who - if anyone - ended up with Dad.
1302 2018-08-05 20:54:18 I just got my SADurday merch and this oil spilled on it LOVE THAT
1303 2018-08-05 20:53:51 If it weren't for "Obama style land grabs" @RepStevePearce and his gang of gasbags would be drilling for oil on land included in #OrganMountainsDesertPeaks National Monument.

1307 2018-08-05 20:52:43 & (hopefully...) provides a strong reminder to oil co's that when investing billions in production increases make sure the product can reach the market! By the way are Asian buyers lined up for the bitumen coming to the coast or that's for later? Bet they'll pay less than the US.
1308 2018-08-05 20:52:24 Wow, I had no idea you could actually still buy Syrian olive oil in the US...
1309 2018-08-05 20:52:14 That is not the reason why Tom. The reason people don't like you  is your obvious lack of loyalty to leader that members chose, your uncanny ability to pour oil on the fire rather than calm things down. You are a divider not a unifier.
1310 2018-08-05 20:51:49 I see the point. But I disagree with it. Essentially the prologue is gratuitousl and it cuts the oil industry & GOP too much slack. But the article itself is factual so @yayitsrob's focus on inconsistencies of the prologue is harsh. It's a good piece with a bewildering prologue.

No thank you.

1316 2018-08-05 20:51:02 You like Kettle chips. Have you tried the avocado oil with Himalayan pink salt ones? Amazing! Less burnt pieces too.

1323 2018-08-05 20:49:56 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Opposing KMX = killing #LGBTQ  how did Kennedy Stewart avoid jail time?

1327 2018-08-05 20:49:17 Let me ask you a logical question. Did Russia collude with trump so they could expel 60 of there diplomats..put sanctions on them...help Ukraine fight Russia or so he could pressure Germany to stop buying there oil. Boy Russia backed the wrong guy huh

1334 2018-08-05 20:47:48 Really, what does the Italian Ambassador care if he violated rules.  Just look at his face!  He is repeating the same mentality as Italy from the 1920's and 1930's towards Libya, its oil and the Mafia

1337 2018-08-05 20:47:19 Well it's basically the same 
U put some oil on the frying pan so the egg won't stick, season the egg then cover it with the lid and wait 
If ur frying pan is nonstick u can flip the egg if you don't like the yolk    moist
1338 2018-08-05 20:47:15 Think about your horrible logic for a second. You won't accept facts from oil companies but accept them from sources who already agree with you. Deny it all you want but you are a walking example of what it means to be closed minded. Truth will stand on its own merit.
1339 2018-08-05 20:46:58 There's a saying in Oil & Gas: "Get closer to the well".
1340 2018-08-05 20:46:57 I’m TIRED of EVERYTHING smelling like COCONUT OIL, COCONUT MILK, ALMOND, ALMOND MILK, HONEY, HONEY MILK (whatever the fuck that is) SHEA, ARGAN OIL & that fuckin COCOA BUTTER. ALL THAT SHIT SMELLS THE SAME AT THIS POINT. When earth coming out with some NEW SMELLS?

1346 2018-08-05 20:46:21 I keep reminding myself that is was minus 10 in January. Enjoy yht weather and no oil bill. Cold and hockey will be here soon enough.
1347 2018-08-05 20:46:06 I don’t put anything past the UK government. The have form on hiding Scotland’s wealth. But I find it hard to believe the near £40b figure. Norway isn’t even making that much from their oil. In the past though...

1349 2018-08-05 20:45:54 ...tempted to just get the car serviced, but I did just spend a ton on oil, coolant and assorted doohickeys. I’ll check the cost... if it is under $200 then yay. If over $500 then nay.

1362 2018-08-05 20:44:37 Midland better have a low unemployment rate lol you can’t even get on the freakin interstate because of all the oil traffic. Txdot needs to add a couple lanes!!
1363 2018-08-05 20:44:34 You're mistaken, horribly. Your example doesn't take into account that it's irrelevant who is producing the evidence provided it is based on facts, truth, logic, & reason. If oil companies can provide evidence climate change is not real, who is providing it doesn't matter.
1364 2018-08-05 20:44:26 did you drop it in oil because this shit looks deep fried as fuck
1365 2018-08-05 20:44:16 so you will deal with a communist country, that (allegedy) harvests prisoner's organs for the blackmarket, use slave labour, one of the top producers of pollution in the world but you won't touch Canada's oil industry? Interesting ethics there.
1366 2018-08-05 20:44:15 So might it also be that way with the oil tycoons and corrupted politicians that pushed forward?  If we powered down in the 70's with Carter would tech have made it far enough to bring forward next phase for humanity?

1369 2018-08-05 20:43:29 Jobs are there if your kid isnt a zip. But real fraud is, esp in Texas, state universities have immense income from burgeoning oil royalties from fracking n horizontal drilling. Permanent University Fund passing on to citizens in form of low tuition?  Uhh no.

Regarding geopolitical situations & scarcity, I really don’t care much about the other countries, I care primarily for the US. Nationalism and all that...

1396 2018-08-05 20:40:03 Yeah I think the bigger ones are much dryer, maybe it's the amount of oil I use  I followed Jamie Oliver's recipe... they turned out like cake 
1397 2018-08-05 20:40:00 Agree. The dollar is to go up which will destroy gold oil and commodities and the Euro will fall
1398 2018-08-05 20:38:59 I'm so glad I'm not alone on this. It is way too important. Do I make myself clear how important it is... or, in other words, do you feel I take this as seriously as you do?
The 'Devil' always mixes his snake oil with an appropriate amount of 'sweetness'. Very few 'see' that.
1399 2018-08-05 20:38:55 Wherever you are, get a bottle of oil as a point of contact and connect in faith as the oil is being prayed upon.

1401 2018-08-05 20:38:17 I'm not even looking at 2020 yet. I just want to ensure that we maintain or gain in the House to drive the agenda.
1402 2018-08-05 20:38:05 Also realize that we are sitting on a perpetual glut of natural gas. So much is produced as a byproduct of shale oil that most natural gas drilling in US land has stopped (save for the NE). We have larger gas reserves than oil and that’s really saying something!

1444 2018-08-05 20:31:21 Mexico's Number One Import is oil. It's number 2 is American money being sent to Mexico mostly by illegals here in this country. Charge a $5 fee for every time that money is sent to Mexico through Western Union, American Express ect... then Mexico will pay for the wall. And fast.
1445 2018-08-05 20:31:20 Very True.  So many Opportunities (Keep Most Of The Money & Jobs In Africa). Ghana & Cote D Ivoire Should Sell Chocolate All Over Africa. Kenya Tea.

1477 2018-08-05 20:27:07 You're a bit slow on the uptake, they have been doing this since day 1. There are only two camps: you decided to run with the snake oil salesmen and only now do you see this.
1478 2018-08-05 20:27:02 While I am pro 2nd, being armed every minute of every day should not be a requirement of a civil society. Society is not civil when one comes and goes with the expectation of violence rather than being prepared for unexpected violence.
1479 2018-08-05 20:26:59 Lol there are already some great results coming from these tariffs, the EU has promised to buy more American soybeans among other crops as well as American produced oil and natural gas and they’re planning on eliminating all of their tariffs they had on America except for cars
1480 2018-08-05 20:26:58 Okay so i am a big advocate of cabbage (being half Russian that i am) u can chop it into a salad (kneed it with salt and it releases juices so u wont need any oil dressing!) also if u look up southern Russian borscht (cut out the meat and its vegan, that’s how my mom makes it) —>

1485 2018-08-05 20:26:13 They don't, but he's the one who said he wanted a challenge rather than an easy job like PSG. He's more than smart enough to know that Utd, owned by leeches, can't fully compete financially with clubs owned by oil states. So we have to be smarter. All I've said is I don't think

1491 2018-08-05 20:25:35 PMB has shown that all the poor infrastructures, pensions problems, upaid dues & whatever can be fixed no matter the oil price.

So whoever comes in even if PMB didn't win 2019 election, #Nigerians will challenge him! The yard stick PMB set is very high.
1492 2018-08-05 20:25:30 What do oil producers want....they want to sell their oil in a "strong currency". 

If there is a high USD gold price, essentially you have a dollar that is weak in terms of gold.

How do the oil producers sell in a "strong currency" if they only sell in USD?
1493 2018-08-05 20:25:23 -don’t use too much shampoo! Too much shampoo isnt too great for your scalp. Thats why you shouldnt drench your scalp in oil. That way you don’t have to shampoo 3 times do get it out. 2 x is the limit, less is more!!

1500 2018-08-05 20:23:32 -oil your scalp! with coconut oil is the best, cause not only does your hair get healthier, it also gets longer and softer! Leave it in for about 2-3 hours and shampoo it out! 
1501 2018-08-05 20:23:28 Back from vacation! I was really hoping that I would feel better, but unfortunately, I don't! The anxiety is better tho ( been taking CBD oil for about a month now ) but the depression is still the same! THANKFULLY I have an appointment with my therapist this month!

1503 2018-08-05 20:22:42 I hope that this is a shameful situation for sanctions. Once again, I warn that if you negotiate with the terrorist regime in Iran or exempt a country from the sanctions on oil, I am pretty sure that the Democrats will win the election. We looked at everything thoroughly

1510 2018-08-05 20:21:22 Double cleanse - oil cleanser + foam cleanser, use AHA and BHA acids, look for tea tree and centella asiática in ingredient lists. Do not use physical scrubs, they will only irritate your skin rather than heal it. Wash face in lukewarm water (not hot!)

1534 2018-08-05 20:17:59 It's not really "full-time service" as we had when I was a child: they don't check your oil and wash your windows. They just pump the gas. I'm all-in for truly quaint!

1540 2018-08-05 20:16:35 Before cutting it off, try deep conditioning and hot oil treatments first. Like consistently. If that doesn’t work, then cut it and then do deep conditioning and hot oil treatments
1541 2018-08-05 20:16:33 I've been tweeting/retweeting, watching videos, trying to distract myself. Yesterday I felt good physically- had an oil dab in the morning, kept me pain free pretty much all day. Not so lucky today- my back has been killing me today- all my back injuries are flaring up hardcore.
1542 2018-08-05 20:16:26 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
1543 2018-08-05 20:16:16 Well, we will never agree on anything then because I’m pretty much ecstatic about the cuts at EPA. Obama turned EPA into a political weapon to wag war on farmers, oil & coal companies and small businesses. US spent 13.9 Billion in 2017 by 19 agencies... to what result?
1544 2018-08-05 20:16:01 In every case, it leads to less freedom. I wish my government could have kept their grubby fingers out of Iran and not sided with British oil interests. It was all before my time. This is our time and none of us should be silent. We have more in common than we do with our leaders
1545 2018-08-05 20:15:58 She keep sending
1546 2018-08-05 20:15:53 The greatest threat to Iran and its people is drought, likely made worse by climate change. 
This shows the need for development in energy usage away from oil. nuclear power is the major step in the short term with solar in the longer term.
1547 2018-08-05 20:15:43 Idk what people are pissed about. They can't change an oil cooler on pit road anyways. So it didnt matter. Todd Gordon should have known they were on the 6 minute clock but they would have been done anyways

1572 2018-08-05 20:12:52 Chavez ran as a liberal. People never imagined in a million years he would end up destroying Venezuela. The right is just as rotten, though and marginalized people were sick of it. Chavez’s words resonated with the poor, which is the majority in Venezuela, an oil rich country.

1595 2018-08-05 20:09:50 Do not damage the environment for financial bribes from the fossil fuel industries lobbyists. especially coal. That is the worst form of PROSTITUTION. Oil and coal as a source of energy is obsolete. The ignorance of earlier times is no longer a valid excuse.
1596 2018-08-05 20:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
1597 2018-08-05 20:09:32 But yeah the price of gas routinely varies 5 or 6 cents a week, so no problem for the oil companies just keeping the carbon credit cut for themselves.

1680 2018-08-05 19:57:30 IQ tests are comprehensively and extensively standardised before being used on a wider population, and it's restricted to the designed cohort. Doing the IQ test designed for a different group than yours renders the result invalid, like using 2 stroke oil in a 4 stroke motor.

1728 2018-08-05 19:50:12 I soak my hand in some vegetable oil or olive oil, it immediately relieves the burning. If you let it soak in the oil 5 min then scrub off gently with soap and water, you'll get off some of the chilli. good luck!

1742 2018-08-05 19:48:18 No doubt many small oil & gas companies have left us with a delinquent well clean up mess, but to be fair, those workers paid dearly into EI as we all do, so I wouldn't consider it a handout. They took advantage of a social service, which is there for that exact purpose.
1743 2018-08-05 19:48:16 It's a flavor neutral oil - I cook with it and... make homemade mayonnaise with it. 

My concern with that mayo is that it's "reduced fat" - that can't be good.
1744 2018-08-05 19:48:15 Chuuya smiled and was relieved with the sight of Dazai actually doing what he was told. Pouring some oil into the frying pan, he sifted in a drawer for a chopstick. The oil needed to be around 180°C, and the mafioso could be able to tell if bubbles formed around the tip of it.
1745 2018-08-05 19:48:10 Also, do you cook with seed oils at home. I know a few people that have their IBS symptoms disappear when they stop using seed oil like sunflower, canola, safflower, etc...

1762 2018-08-05 19:46:23 The fact that was women who had discomfort with oil based contrast fell pregnant supports the mechanical hypothesis for tubal flushing. It also questions the utility of the increasingly frequent ‘oil bathing’ before IVF procedures.

1772 2018-08-05 19:44:56 Until last year it had Scotland something like £16.8 bill in the red for oil and mineral revenues that year. Initially touted that this was due to drop in oil prices. But turns out it wasn't it was just lost in audit. Like I said ineptitude on par with criminality.
1773 2018-08-05 19:44:55 No joke! I dropped 2 drops of Cayenne oil underneath my tongue and my sinuses cleared up within 10 min. 
1774 2018-08-05 19:44:38 Imho i think algerian cuisine is v v healthy even some of the cakes  - i think the portion sizes can be slightly unhealthy...but then again this could be that my mother in law makes most things in olive oil, and makes the cakes herself!
1775 2018-08-05 19:44:14 I realise your too young and innocent to remember that long ago.

I just pointed out that you can’t say it’s climate change all the time. In 1976, no one had ever heard of climate change, heck we’d just started oil out of the North Sea.

1781 2018-08-05 19:43:35 It was never socialism. Chavez was a grifter and whoever says I’m a fascist for writing this has never been to Venezuela. They really think Chavez was like Castro. Castro had Chavez thinking he was Simon Bolivar reincarnated and got tons of oil from Vzla for his people.

1807 2018-08-05 19:39:59 @JustinTrudeau just can't understand why taxpayers are pissed he gave millions to BIG Oil's Kinder Morgan for a pipeline they didn't want considering Canada already charges the lowest royalty rates and gives billions in subsidies!! #cdnpoli
1808 2018-08-05 19:39:55 CBD Oil, as with whole plant cannabis, is an absolutely AMAZING medicine. I put down 5 prescriptions over cannabis. If interested in a very large amount of compiled data on the topic, one need only go to Granny Stormcrow's List. She's been compiling it for years.

1812 2018-08-05 19:38:58 His own people are starving, they don’t have jobs, they don’t have freedom to speak up and he is enjoying all kind of luxuries. That’s how a dictatorship works. Why Venezuela suffers when they are oil rich? Because of the corruption in government and system. Need the cleansing.

1816 2018-08-05 19:38:31 My teething 8 month old is now getting real excited when I pull out her bottle of Copaiba essential oil for pain relief haha. She practically bites my finger off to get some on her gums! #naturalpainrelief #naturalremedies #essentialoils #teething #antiinflammatory #copaiba
1817 2018-08-05 19:38:19 China's Commerce Ministry said the new tariff charges would range between 5% and 25% and will be imposed immediately in order to "guard its interests." Items included on the list include soybean oil, peanut oil, coffee, wheat flour and spirits, as well as steel and iron ore.

1819 2018-08-05 19:38:09 I am realizing I drank a lot yesterday. Like at one point I had Que oil mixed with Nupe Juice in my cup and somebody poured some Rémy in that same cup 
1820 2018-08-05 19:38:04 Love powder spf. I usually like powder stuff because I’m oily combo skin.  Powder helps reduce the oil and the fact that it’s a stick perfect for the on the go girl! Thanks!!!!
1821 2018-08-05 19:37:52 You know what you get for that Jake? The gas chamber. You know what the gas chamber smells like? Pine oil. I'ma send you to a pine oil heaven

1823 2018-08-05 19:37:30 The end of life is heartbreaking.  

I’m babysitting a friend’s doggy this week who has seizures & he rec’s CBD oil droplets 2x daily. If not, Remi would shake until he seized.  

You’ll be extra sad for awhile.
1824 2018-08-05 19:37:24 86 toyota pickup with the long bed. Dad gave it to me with 238k miles. Gave it back before joining the military with 428k miles. Oil changes and a distributer cap replacement was all it needed for those 9 years. Great machines 
1825 2018-08-05 19:37:19 “Right now I’m taking it easy,” says @RyanJNewman during the Stage 1 break. P6. Need to clean the grill. Taking 4 tires and fuel. @Lucas_Oil

1827 2018-08-05 19:37:00 Dry skin? Olive oil. Rash? Olive oil. Ear ache? Olive oil. Dry hair? Olive oil. Any ailment? Olive oil. Bland pasta? Olive oil. 

Olive oil saves lives 
1828 2018-08-05 19:37:00 I wanna spread more than oil lol
1829 2018-08-05 19:36:48 Dear Donald Trump Jr.
How does it feel to see you mean no more to daddy than any other piece of fodder he uses to cover his own ass?
Can you please change the oil while you're down there under the bus?

"Trump Tower"
1830 2018-08-05 19:36:46 Need to buy some oil for my hair

1832 2018-08-05 19:36:18 Terrible idea repeated often by people who don't understand what Alaska's PFD is (I was born there). That fund is royalties from oil development on public lands. The Legacy Fund is derived from a tax. I'm not in favor of taxing oil companies only to redistribute the revenues.
1833 2018-08-05 19:36:11 Again, come on, that last sentence is crazy, don't mean to offend u but seriously, "you won't get all your waters with oil" ? Is westminster going to deploy warships into the north sea ? Are they going to blow up the pipelines that come ashore in Scotland ? Or steal Aberdeen ?
1834 2018-08-05 19:36:02 Cbd oil with thc

1843 2018-08-05 19:35:17 What has he done to drain the swamp? Appointing an obscenely wealthy woman who's never gone to public school to run our education system? His former oil mogul Secretary of State? His former EPA head who sued the EPA almost a dozen times? Jeff Sessions? Stephen Miller? Swamp city.
1844 2018-08-05 19:35:12 I just applied tissue oil 
1845 2018-08-05 19:35:01 Ding!  Ding! Ding!  And I've never heard of a "religious war" in which a little territory (land, seaports) or resources (oil, gold) weren't seized.
1846 2018-08-05 19:34:37 Reliability ratings are everything to me.   I can't afford constant repairs! Working on 7 years with my Prius. Only oil and tire changes.
1847 2018-08-05 19:34:28 Which attack?
This new 2018 attack??
Or was it one of the many times WE played the role of insurgents into THEIR politics, ON their soil during United Fruit days, oil exploration days, drug war days, or, run of the mill regime changes WE wanted.
1848 2018-08-05 19:34:20 But the oil runs off when in the shower, yo know.. where Abby is about to see what this succubus mouth can do----
1849 2018-08-05 19:34:18 When’s the last time you exfoliated your skin? Used toner? Do you clean inside and behind your ears? Belly button? Do you oil the bottom of your feet? Elbows? #SelfCareSundays
1850 2018-08-05 19:34:13 Money is so stressful, like my car desperately needs an oil change, my AC stopped working in it last week, I need stuff for school but I barely can cover my bills right now because now I’m in school I’m not working as much hahahahahaha
1851 2018-08-05 19:33:38 Literally: to sell oil

1858 2018-08-05 19:32:33 Also:
~ Prolong the Freshness of Eggs — You can use coconut oil to seal the pores in an egg shell and prolong the life of the eggs in your refrigerator. 
~ Replace Unhealthy Fats When Baking —Use the same amount as butter or vegetable oil that is called for in the recipe.

1860 2018-08-05 19:32:11 I forgive all you hundreds of people who had 1 job in Joel’s Army to partner your business with Red Letter Ministries but you reasoned it away. Fresh oil on you anyway! 
1861 2018-08-05 19:32:10 No real analog for VZ oil sector in Cuba or East Europe. Dependency on Soviet patronage had different economic logic. In a lot of ways it’s the oil curse playing out in a different context...
1862 2018-08-05 19:31:57 I think I’d probably like makeup if it didn’t feel weird and like an extra oil on my face. 
1863 2018-08-05 19:31:55 @HLA_MPP_Kramp Ask the likes of Carbon McKenna to put the upstream and downstream emission requirements on foreign oil and on the auto industry and Bombardier. And impose gender based analysis on foreign oil.
1864 2018-08-05 19:31:40 Don't forget the tanning oil.
1865 2018-08-05 19:31:33 Yeah but it's a stupid rule and that's why we are upset, you could replace a oil cooler in 3 caution laps at some tracks, and always still contend for the win, stupid.
1866 2018-08-05 19:31:18 Beware Chuckie in sheep’s clothing! He’s only agreed to meet with Kavanaugh so he can seem reasonable when trashing him. There’s always an ulterior motive for Senator Plugs & it’s never good. The only thing greater than his urge to lie is his addiction to camera time & hair oil.
1867 2018-08-05 19:31:15 1882 - Standard Oil of New Jersey is established
1868 2018-08-05 19:31:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or their ability to be financially self-sufficient.
1869 2018-08-05 19:31:00 In my opinion, shipping oil by truck and train is ar more dangerous to the environment and to people than a pipeline.

1872 2018-08-05 19:30:52 One of the hardest decisions I make daily as a black man is whether to wear a hat or not. Because with black hair you either commit to the hat for an entire day or you put da oil in your hair and let it ride. But you can’t have both

1875 2018-08-05 19:30:40 CBD oil is legal in many states and has very notable effects on pain, mental state, and more, without risk of actual drug test failure, aside from maybe a false positive, as, as long as it is classified as hemp, the THC content is such that you cannot get high.
1876 2018-08-05 19:30:37 Chunk is gross. Solid in water is where it's at. Def no oil.
1877 2018-08-05 19:30:30 Like the wealthy or Big Pharma, Oil, Steel, Gas, etc. Dont get "entitlements" to tune of Billions every year....BUT mention helping the worker or poor get a leg up...ppl lose their minds....now who's NOT thinking ??

1880 2018-08-05 19:30:27 You clearly don't consume factual news. Did he promise to cancel military exercises with South Korea? Did he promise to smear and insult our allies? Did he promise to drive up oil prices by reducing MPG requirements? He is compromised by blackmail, financial 1st and now treason.
1881 2018-08-05 19:30:23 Production of palm oil in large quantities.. It's very lucrative.
1882 2018-08-05 19:30:22 If you ever make a lotion that smells like the starfish mask you made does I’ll be in heaven, but I’m very excited to try this one because hemp seed oil lotions are my favorite 
1883 2018-08-05 19:30:07 Use the oil mate 3x sprays under the tongue daily depending on the strength of course
1884 2018-08-05 19:29:56 But if you have oil.Why don't you have nice roads, Airports and stadiums. Nigeria should be on dubai and qatar level if it's all about oil .All i was saying is Kenya has way better facilities and we don't have the luxury of oil .Tell your government to do better .
1885 2018-08-05 19:29:56 Food related:
~ Cooking at High Heat (Sauteing and Frying) — Coconut oil is great for cooking at a high heat because of its high smoke point.
~ Natural Energy Booster — The medium chain triglycerides in coconut oil, will give you an energy boost whenever you need it.
1886 2018-08-05 19:29:41 Then when oil prices slid the whole system collapsed quickly bc price controls and (especially) multiple exchange rates are terrible for real economic growth. Also oil production leveled off b/c int’l investors scared by turmoil, so investment in capital goods & tech fell behind.

1895 2018-08-05 19:29:07 Oil or alcohol will remove capsaicin. It's not very water soluble.

1901 2018-08-05 19:28:31 There's a self serve gas station near Kinleith that is always 20 odd cents cheaper than anywhere.  It's miles away from a port, which makes me wonder how the normal oil company argument of proximity and higher prices works.  I think I paid $1.97 last time I rolled through.

Now, the ones from that beautiful part that has no name will be given jobs in any oil sector created. All that was planned ahead of time. Time for them to harvest. “Mbu he will go” #mbyogede
1932 2018-08-05 19:24:33 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
1933 2018-08-05 19:24:26 What’s wrong with eggs and oil, they’re a great combo. They’ve never once disappointed me.
1934 2018-08-05 19:24:14 Well done Oil. Buzzing for you. Richly deserved.

1942 2018-08-05 19:23:20 Dear @McDonalds please bring quality control back to #Aruba The food at the #Mcdonalds doesn’t taste close to anything like what it should be. Store very dirty & food tastes horrible, like old oil. #CustomerService #Foodie
1943 2018-08-05 19:23:13 I want panera but I need to go get my oil changed and I wanna go get my nails don’t but I gotta clean my room and I want to go get a massage but I gotta get my stuff in order for school aaaaaaaaahhhhhh

1946 2018-08-05 19:22:57 "Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over" (Psalm 23:5).

Interestingly, David uses present tense, here...that must mean that GOD anoints me 'in the NOW'!
1947 2018-08-05 19:22:39 Ima use this beard oil every day and c what happen
1948 2018-08-05 19:22:37 MMMM! I would LOVE to spread oil on your ASStounding ass @IrynaIvanova9 ! I will spread it,  rub it,  kiss it and lick it for hours!
1949 2018-08-05 19:22:36 Imagine Buhari wants to build a refinery in Katsina where there is no single drop of oil
1950 2018-08-05 19:22:04 "Oil pressure is dropping little by little," reports AJ Allmendinger. He made a pit stop under caution for some damage. 

The crew says it should go down as the engine temp cools down at speed and they're fine for now. #NASCAR
1951 2018-08-05 19:21:50 Bet next time a team will keep their out on the track and hose down the track with oil to keep from being on the damage clock
1952 2018-08-05 19:21:49 Just spilled several cups worth of salmon oil for my dog all over myself and my floor, how's your Sunday going?? 
1953 2018-08-05 19:21:32 Is Trump's real goal to manipulate higher oil prices to help Russia and the Saudis?
1954 2018-08-05 19:21:28 Of course you do! You'd also support nationalizing our oil production right?
1955 2018-08-05 19:21:21 Busted oil cooler when everyone checked up and he whacked the 42

1964 2018-08-05 19:20:25 Try treadmill belt oil too it may help I just had this. Dont use a ton tho I'm still cleaning up oils.
1965 2018-08-05 19:20:09 Nascar pretty much took the team out of it.  Change the oil cooler and go back out. Now he has to go to the care center because he drove through some gravel.  Some of these rules don't make sense.
1966 2018-08-05 19:20:06 ask them if they have an oil for bofa
1967 2018-08-05 19:19:50 Let's get a look at some of those corporations she has taken money from.
1968 2018-08-05 19:19:45 Is the oil in Venezuela?
1969 2018-08-05 19:19:40 Can't change an oil cooler on pit road and you damn sure can't do it in 6 minutes. Bummer for those guys (and @PregameEngineer pick). #GoBowlingAtTheGlen

1971 2018-08-05 19:19:34 I lived in Virgin Islands-worked in oil: Buffalo  would come for vacation: Tory said Bilks partied hard & Kelly led the way
1972 2018-08-05 19:19:27 LOGA out of the race.  Oil cover broken, went to the garage, but they're on the damage clock, so that was the end of it.  #nascar
1973 2018-08-05 19:19:22 That should be chilli OIL

In my defense it's like 3 AM around here really

1975 2018-08-05 19:19:12 I made such a few months ago, the oil wasn't enough and the puff puff couldn't float to give the perfect shape it deserves .
Though the taste was intact.

1977 2018-08-05 19:19:02 Logano out with broken oil cooler. Team didn't know they were on damage clock and went to garage. Allmendinger has damage, pits, nothing internally wrong, they think.
1978 2018-08-05 19:18:55 Don't even call oil into it! We have abundance of that.  So there's enough to go round. You can't blame a rich kid from comíng from a rich home. It's his entitlement
1979 2018-08-05 19:18:55 Until then we will just assume they are fish killing, oil spilling, SUV driving, tree chopping, knuckle dragging right wingers who speak in ignorance of climate change, content watching the North Shore wash away while crushing beers in the smog. @stu_neatby

1984 2018-08-05 19:18:24 I think in his case they will probably offer a cash payout unless he wants to play oil me up and slide me in with a shoehorn
1985 2018-08-05 19:18:16 I pulled mines out the other day putting coconut oil on my face 
1986 2018-08-05 19:18:15 Want a free cab Tucson Lyft is giving promo code, for up 2 $50 bucks. Enter ENTER10 as Lyft code,. Skip Uber. Super coup. oil
1987 2018-08-05 19:18:10 And that's their goal.
The suppression of alternative energies by oil interests goes back decades. They don't want to relinquish control of fossil fuel, nor allow the loss of its dominance because controlling energy=controlling the world.Alt energies can't be controlled so easily
1988 2018-08-05 19:18:07 I used bleach! I'm not sure what brand but I also used color stripper because I had colored it dark brown! if you use bleach I really recommend a hair mask or coconut oil afterwards!
1989 2018-08-05 19:18:03 {I look down at my outfit, covering the oil stains from my current invention with my hands and shrug, never really caring for the latest trends as long the garment is comfortable.} What's wrong with my outfit?
1990 2018-08-05 19:17:59 It seems that this is Orwellian- the GBRF is run by the fossil fuel industry who WANT the Reef dead so that they can rob us of our the oil that lies beneath it. #auspol
1991 2018-08-05 19:17:55 Add to this that Cuba had a minimal, agrarian economy and almost no exports, so ensured poverty but stability; Chavez by comparison nationalized/trashed an oil industry that was a huge share of GDP and a major exporter
1992 2018-08-05 19:17:52 Two so called superfoods I couldn't eat/drink if my life depended on it - coconut oil and matcha.
1993 2018-08-05 19:17:46 InshaAllah bro, our land, our oil.. we will never give up, my people are warriors.. we will die for our land! And yeah its pretty common with African leaders selling the resources to west and they get some money for their pockets in return smh 
1994 2018-08-05 19:17:19 I think the drought is making them try to get in. They started coming in cracks into our kitchen recently. If you’re looking for a way to ward them off, we had good success blocking cracks with cotton dabbed with peppermint oil.
1995 2018-08-05 19:17:18 Agreed-fundamental difference is oil sector and VZ’s enormous reserves. Gov’t could use oil income to pay for social spending without boosting real growth (very inflationary). “Managed” inflation via price controls & multi-tiered exchange rates. Worked somewhat w/ high oil prices

1998 2018-08-05 19:17:07 He was put on damage vehicle policy, and since he went to the garage to change the oil cooler, he is out of the race now, regardless if they could get it fixed or not
1999 2018-08-05 19:16:55 Though to be fair I don't think you can replace the oil cooler on pit road
2000 2018-08-05 19:16:49 I can't believe half the field didn't wreck in all that oil Logano put down. #NASCAR #GoBowlingAtTheGlen
2001 2018-08-05 19:16:40 Joey Logano in the garage and is done for the day after a broke oil cooler. He was also on the 6 minute caution clock for damage to the nose. AJ Allmendinger also has damage to the nose from the Logano incident.

2024 2018-08-05 19:15:09 It's like one of those medicines you were forced to take as a child, except even those were generally good for you. Your parents knew best. Not so with the present government, they've set their mind on a cure for our supposed ills, to heal with snake oil from dodgy tradesmen. 
2025 2018-08-05 19:15:08 That.Fucking.Hurts. I had gallstones at 27. I removed them with an amazing apple juice and olive oil cleanse. My oldest son is disabled from gall bladder surgery done in 2009. Chronic pancreatitis.

2027 2018-08-05 19:14:47 Wi agree, and if they offer to pay off their debt of 10 chickens with 2 bushels of wheat, what would you call that?  Any example would work, a debt of 5 lambs for a gold piece, a debt of a bushel of wheat for a jug of olive oil.  That is how economies have worked for millennia
2028 2018-08-05 19:14:44 All I asked for was an oil change and they charged me for all sorts of extra shit including and window wash for $9........I’ve called and yelled twice now but maybe a 3rd for shits and giggles
2029 2018-08-05 19:14:34 Logano may have had an oil line break. He is currently in the garage.

~Natural Skin Moisturizer— Using coconut oil for skin health works well as a moisturizer for your face.

2066 2018-08-05 19:09:32 Ironic.
Oil countries with high levels of political corruption don’t do wealth distribution.
We have most of the oil in the whole of Europe and yet foodbanks in every city and town in Scotland.
@BBC tells us we live in a fair society. Is the BBC the opium of the masses?
2067 2018-08-05 19:09:22 This is so true.

Let's not forget that the plastics industry is tied to the oil industry. They all need to take a share of the responsibility too.
2068 2018-08-05 19:09:18 I’m allergic to coconut and I accidentally washed my hair with shampoo that has coconut oil and now my scalp is on fiiiirreeeeee. So itchy

2078 2018-08-05 19:08:08 @ShashiTharoor is right Swami Vivekanand will be attacked by oil today by @incindia goons such is the hatred towards Hindus under Sonia and Rahul @aajtak @ndtv @toi @timesnow @BJP4India
2079 2018-08-05 19:07:56 Do you know how hard it is to clean up 3 gallons of OIL?!
2080 2018-08-05 19:07:41 The oil extracted from the seeds is rich in powerful antioxidants which protect skin against free radical damage. High Vitamin C content assists with skin elasticity.
Vitamins A and B firm, tighten and hydrate skin. Omegas 3, 6 & 9 fatty acids help maintain the integrity of skin.
2081 2018-08-05 19:07:24 @MissAmyMarie48 you are a lot like me. Had a stay in the state hospital. In ND, since the population is only 700,000, and the state takes in billions in oil money, 2 psychiatrists fir each person, jacuzzzi, 15 racers to roam, swimming pool, computer lab, great food.
2082 2018-08-05 19:07:22 Lol she already clean the oil makes it look messy..  all that thickness @MsMyaG had on set needed to be worshipped like @RealMikeAdriano would had lol..

2089 2018-08-05 19:06:41 really don't want anyone to feel bad and hope I'm not coming across as admonishing. to be specific I'm shitting on this knative narrative and the snake oil its selling.
2090 2018-08-05 19:06:32 If you stir coconut oil into your kale, it makes it so much easier to scrape it into the trash.
2091 2018-08-05 19:06:11 Nakaimagine ko ug siomai with chilli oil aaaaaaaa
2092 2018-08-05 19:05:51 Movie theaters need to have an express popcorn line the way quick line oil change places do.
2093 2018-08-05 19:05:51 Oil man.  Rich.  Then he'd tap out.

2095 2018-08-05 19:05:27 Through Importation of Rice, Toothpicks, Toilet Papers, Gari, Fake Drugs, Tomatoes, Palm oil etc. They lost jobs from Illicit means
2096 2018-08-05 19:05:24 Most Pak Govt Oil/Gas reports tend to concentrate on just the first part... when you take away the jargon, best practices & buzzwords... there is very little substance left.. which is why these reports never generate any real impetus among industry experts to follow-up
2097 2018-08-05 19:05:21 i’m gonna go get an oil change for my car how straight of me
2098 2018-08-05 19:05:19 むくり。行こう

2101 2018-08-05 19:04:55 Sook the heeds, sook the heeds, they're delicious
2102 2018-08-05 19:04:48 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
2103 2018-08-05 19:04:44 And even with the UK and Australia, the evidence doesn't support the claim that gun control works.
2104 2018-08-05 19:04:42 But, Venezuela's plight is not hopeless. Of a population of 30 million, 2 - 3 million are working abroad, the majority of whom are sending remittance back. Even with a total collapse of oil production & dollarization that would be sufficient to restart the economy.
2105 2018-08-05 19:04:33 Beard oil is a necessity.  It's the only non shampoo/soap accessory I have. Dial, 2 and 1 shampoo, and Cremo beard cream.
2106 2018-08-05 19:04:31 Black seed oil is a natural bug repellent...you’re welcome 
2107 2018-08-05 19:04:21 I think L and her Mom could be working for big oil, for the purpose of getting me out of the way, L's Mom's book on EL Segundo, big oil country, Birdie calling me randomly some years ago and telling me about all his natural gas rights he has in Fresno for no reason, and my Mom,
2108 2018-08-05 19:04:17 Iraq is a rich country with oil. This should not happen.
2109 2018-08-05 19:04:15 Ke dai bari. Until my aunt started making baobab oil, I didn't know that it was an actual thing. She's still selling it en-masse at a giveaway price cuz it's not known in the Nigerian market.
2110 2018-08-05 19:04:12 Although, that would have to be a lot of crisps to get that much oil into you... the salt would probably do you some serious damage first.
2111 2018-08-05 19:03:58 There are many places where oil is found. At lease five different Ethiopian States.
2112 2018-08-05 19:03:56 When you put tea tree oil on your face but the smell is TOO MUCH

Girlie o, if I break your heart na oil spillage 

I study this your love for freedom college 
2114 2018-08-05 19:03:27 Whats funny about it is that Venezuela has an incredible amount of state owned oil to back them.... Imagine countries without this literal printing press.. No chance in hell.
2115 2018-08-05 19:03:26 Our own was so happy that he even got his hat  knocked off now that we discovered oil and we have many students of that subject, we have ourselves jobs in the neighborhood. We shall help them drill the oil and price it on international level #mbyogede
2116 2018-08-05 19:03:19 You this old man since 40years you are shopping  Nigeria money you suppose to tire, no more oil well,no more oil block.
2117 2018-08-05 19:03:07 Oil/Gas companies are notorious culprits when it comes to pellet-scattering buzzwords aka 'efficiency','sustainability','synergy','responsible growth'..but when you extract them,the remainder of the report presents strategy for delivery & a 'quantifiable' path to its achievement
2118 2018-08-05 19:03:06 Then plact in the national interest. The pipeline is only of benefit to a few in Alberta. The additional oil is a huge risk to the enforcement and the economy.
2119 2018-08-05 19:02:53 peppermint oil feels so niceeee
2120 2018-08-05 19:02:51 What are the legal implications of sending /using CBD oil in states where even CBD isn't legalized yet?

2122 2018-08-05 19:02:27 Lol we're good,its just twitter
2123 2018-08-05 19:02:11 “The cruse of oil will not fail” Put your trust In God. Sometimes He asks us to do things we don’t think we are capable of and it is scary. But if we trust in Him and follow Him we will see the miracle of our capacity increase #trustintheLord #JesusSaves
2124 2018-08-05 19:02:06 goldenseal is an herbal that might be cheaper solo, shiitake is medicinal/gourmet mushrooms. tea tree oil is very healthy but generally not used internally, I use it regularly for topical antiseptic/pain relief. I would have to look up a few of the other ingredients. 3/later

2126 2018-08-05 19:01:55 No they don’t. People who want to control the oil and water supply so they can sell it back to the people do this. People whose sanctions didn’t break their leader do this. Stop being brainwashed by brietbart.
2127 2018-08-05 19:01:43 Do not forget that America paved the way for the coup of Egypt. The army in charge of this coup and supported an undeniable fact. America is also the beneficiary of creating dictatorial regimes in the Middle East to seize oil and the wealth of peoples.

2132 2018-08-05 19:00:55 It’s actually step 4, The Final Line - Volga. The Volga is the river that Stalingrad sits on. Major passage south to the Caucasus and Caspian Sea. Huge oil reserves, and passage to (what the Germans assumed would be) the Indian subcontinent.

2136 2018-08-05 19:00:32 Inshallah, Allah helps the people and the oil should only be for the Somali people not for big oil companies. That's what happened in Nigeria - they have oil but the corrupt leaders only give it to the West and keep the wealth for themselves .

2140 2018-08-05 19:00:12 Trump has been a chronic liar his entire life. He's nothing more than a traveling snake oil salesman.
2141 2018-08-05 19:00:06 2 centuries over the evolution scale is a pittance in comparison. Really? Treat oil like gold, not water. But to do so, to raise prices we need to reduce its waste thru legislation. And fix supply lines. & tax the crap out of it. Literally. We’ve already built it out too far.
2142 2018-08-05 19:00:02 Bro my homie dad just found my oil pen I lost a few weeks ago and hit it LMAO that man about to die
2143 2018-08-05 18:59:48 If I had to live in Canada I’d live in Alberta, probably Edmonton near the oil sands.
2144 2018-08-05 18:59:33 Are you even aware Russia is broke. Their gdp is 1/20 ours, it has no production other than oil and weapons. They are a gas station using cheapest form of war cyber and blackmail of your idolized leader who will be found guilty of conspiracy fraud & possible treason against USA
2145 2018-08-05 18:59:27 Why can’t we do this in the USA? Oh wait big money from oil companies lining the pockets of our politicians
2146 2018-08-05 18:59:24 @SearsAuto @Uber_CHI @uber was at Schaumburg, IL and was told by Muhamed that Uber inspections aren’t done on weekends, contrary to Uber website. Polite guy but wasn’t willing to help. And booked for oil changes even though every bay was empty except 2.
2147 2018-08-05 18:59:16 "Ahhh, now here is a fine Charmer and a GREAT Charlatan! Have Confidence in him!!! SNAKE OIL! GET YOUR SNAKE OIL HERE!!! Infused with the finest Russian oil of caviar!"

2150 2018-08-05 18:58:55 Where What water or oil ?
2151 2018-08-05 18:58:53 Hi, I'm okay.  Enjoying not having to go out in the heat this weekend.  Husband took my car & got a oil change for me. He got a cupon for a free car wash after the oil change.  So he also got my car washed & they cleaned inside the car too.
2152 2018-08-05 18:58:37 I love putting on coconut oil and smelling like a Samoa cookie
2153 2018-08-05 18:58:25 Let's hope the oil doesn't run out too soon or it will be back to normal for you delusional citeh fans
2154 2018-08-05 18:58:18 What oil is it fried in?
2155 2018-08-05 18:58:11 prep your veg, cut toms in half, peppers in wide strips, onions in quarters (add garlic if you like), put in roasting dish with olive oil. Roast on low oven till all soft and unctuous. Get rid of skins, then whizz up with veg stock - bingo. Add Basil, black pepper to taste
2156 2018-08-05 18:58:04 Is it your oil block? Are u from Akwa Ibom? How e take concern you?
2157 2018-08-05 18:58:00 oil refinery down the street was letting out gas yesterday afternoon. resulted in dried up air and warm wind all through the night unusual like the desert. yet we're near the harbor
2158 2018-08-05 18:57:43 The Oil Barron/Corndog is going to prove a lot of doubters wrong. IMO. Save Sanders and Dru Brown for the future.
2159 2018-08-05 18:57:36 So Amish after stealing some yam I just fried is asking me how does oil fry yam

2162 2018-08-05 18:56:27 Pls watch YouTube: what  Maduro did to Venezuela w/only 30% approve rating. We will be living just as the most oil rich country in the world now lives-it IS what Trump is doing to USA. Cult has blinders on w/ fun Trump reality presidency.

2165 2018-08-05 18:55:56 He was never going to give them up. Trump got played like he always does. Now NK has more cash flow and oil. Thanks Trump.
2166 2018-08-05 18:55:37 Definite inconsistency from some of our fellow conservatives out there now when it comes to Trump.
2167 2018-08-05 18:55:36 I wonder when all these UCP types and the oil patch boosters are going to realize that workers were laid off by the oil companies, the same ones getting government hand outs, the same ones leaving Albertans with the clean up, and the same ones making profits without rehiring.

2169 2018-08-05 18:55:34 Presumably a descendant of Ullswater Beatexus 8th? A Shebeg model (+oil painting) of that cow made £190 at auction - unfortunately I missed it! Is the Moss Rose from Grove?
2170 2018-08-05 18:55:31 Pretty much, should be noted but they're rampantly militaristic and that's been a key feature in Venezuela since a very long time, most of the gains are mostly somewhat social-democratic gains I guess, tax money allocation from oil revenue, which becomes harder with an oil crisis
2171 2018-08-05 18:55:17 حصل إيه يابن عمي 
2172 2018-08-05 18:55:10 Create jobs and increase wages not stifle wages, and not shut down industry like oil, coal, used auto industry’s etc...to reward his political donors. That would have been one way to solve a recession.

2179 2018-08-05 18:54:23 Perfect storm of:
- Low charisma leader following Chavez
- Oil price collapse of 2012
- Low investment in oil production
- Extreme official corruption derived from manipulated exchange rate
2180 2018-08-05 18:54:22 Namanje I can give it 

1. Cetaphil Face wash and then Xeroderm sunscreen in the morning 
2. Same face wash and epimax

2185 2018-08-05 18:52:19 I know nothing of Venezuela but I do know Scotland is an oil rich country.
2186 2018-08-05 18:52:14 Interesting. I am doing a bit of research on the issue, due to oil being found. I feel there's going to be some more trouble in the region. So many major players are now interested. Somalia needs to be very aware.
2187 2018-08-05 18:52:12 Now it’s just an “oil pen” lol
2188 2018-08-05 18:52:09 Hey ant mate hope your well does the CBD oil help with anxiety and panick attacks asking for a mate of mine
2189 2018-08-05 18:52:05 The Arsenal, Man U and Liverpool are the Royalty of English football. 

Rubles and oil will never buy that!
2190 2018-08-05 18:51:59 Hey girl! I’m not scientist but I wanted to let you know that my mom and all the foster kids use tea tree oil in their hair everyday ( wash/detangler) and we have a cat and a dog! It’s been that was for years and they have no side effects but every case is different !
2191 2018-08-05 18:51:58 You want local jobs, like in the oil sands, but want to impede foreign investment, like in the oil sands. 

But your solutions only ever involve pointing and yelling “No! No! No!”
2192 2018-08-05 18:51:50 Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!
2193 2018-08-05 18:51:38 City manager make bank,  my little <30,000 people average household around $30k city manger make 300k and is a retired state employee.  It’s a total joke CAGov city, county and state are screwing the people!!

2195 2018-08-05 18:51:30 Bartenders and TV remotes are like oil and water.
2196 2018-08-05 18:51:29 I crave sugar but I ignore it. I haven’t touched sugar for 2 years though so I probably find it easier. It’s common for your body to try other addictions to get over an addiction. CBD oil is supposed to be good
2197 2018-08-05 18:51:28 They have proven that our lives don't matter.We have taken our destinies into our hands. Those who think they can trade us for oil n exploit our resources @NewAge, think again. We won't fold our arms n b enslaved by this wicked world

2200 2018-08-05 18:51:11 No that’s heirloom tomatoes tossed in oil and vinegar.  Definitely not salsa
2201 2018-08-05 18:51:10 Difference is oil is cheap, efficient and reliable. We have spent 10s of billions of dollars on wind farms which provide a tiny fraction (about 6%) of our energy needs. A catastrophic waste of $$ and arguably the worst policy misstep in the history of the province.
2202 2018-08-05 18:51:06 @therealpondguy we have noticed bubbles that float to the surface in our pond and then an oil ring. It’s bit near the edge or the pump. It’s in the center of the pond. Do you know what would cause oil to be in the pond and then rise to the surface?

A good mate of mine is VERY VERY knowledge in regards to engines and the recent technology so I'll ask him
2206 2018-08-05 18:50:46 Grumbling even more, Nakahara took some oil, an egg, and a bowl. Pouring the neutral oil in, he cracked the egg over the rim and began beating it.

2207 2018-08-05 18:50:46 @realDonaldTrump when we buying oil and gas form these countries that u say are doing us wrong we do alot better with our habsburg debt
2208 2018-08-05 18:50:44 Propane here's sometimes used for heating & cooking. Sizes vary from 20lb bbq tanks to main ones at distributors. Some onsite are sizeable. None are huge. Unsure of details. Heating oil's used, eg ~50% of dwellings use mainly oil heating (was >70%); electric resist+HPs on rise.
2209 2018-08-05 18:50:20 They cook their stuff in peanut oil  I don’t want you swelling up again friend
2210 2018-08-05 18:50:20 You are the one to choose measure.. not me.. I've not compared anything..

It's not okay to compare 99-02 with 15-18... but it's ok to compare 15-18 (avg oil price of $50/bbl) to 12-15 (avg oil price of $120/bbl).

I can see d sense and logic in yhur stance.

It's pretty obvious
2211 2018-08-05 18:50:13 So my favs re in warri n it's can't see dem cos it's a strictly by invitation ceremony anyways it's a huge one guys, it's a wealthy oil mogul's wife 30th birthday, all nice n good, glad my favs re mingling with d high n mighty in d society, #Bamteddy aren't mediocres

2213 2018-08-05 18:49:55 Annabi yafi kowa iya gaye kuma kayansa baya datti. If you keep your trouser like this for a month it will hardly be that dirty except the knee where we prostrate. Even that one if a clean carpet is in ur mosque you're safe
2214 2018-08-05 18:49:37 I'm from Pittsburgh.   We have so moved on from steel & wouldn't want it back.  I had family that worked in the mills both moved on though one is quite ill thanks to the mill.  It's time to find a new way.  He can't turn back time.  Stop putting your faith in a snake oil salesman

2219 2018-08-05 18:49:10 Can five guys stop cooking stuff with peanut oil? I want a burger
2220 2018-08-05 18:48:44 Kylie won’t pull into the oil change. To much anxiety
2221 2018-08-05 18:48:41 stop using lotions and start using almond oil
2222 2018-08-05 18:48:22 The real reason for that is that corporations own the US government, and actively shape foreign policy. If we weren't propping up tyrants because they keep oil cheap, and overthrowing democratic governments that oppose us, we wouldn't be so resented.
2223 2018-08-05 18:48:15 Venezuela has more oil than Saudi Arabia despite this its citizen's are starving to death. How can people still believe in socialism ?
2224 2018-08-05 18:48:11 The USA is now in fact backing the dollar with petroleum. That is why the USA is wagging war there on countries that don't want to use the dollar for oil system.

2226 2018-08-05 18:48:08 Butter, oil or margarine. Ideally butter
2227 2018-08-05 18:47:58 @realDonaldTrump 4% aint shit when gas and oil and other things should be alot cheaper. You aint shit
2228 2018-08-05 18:47:54 Is Birdie from Penzoil my real Dad? And its big oil that's been after me?
2229 2018-08-05 18:47:52 “I’m just really glad he invested in beard oil” -@kathleenhayn about jayson werth
2230 2018-08-05 18:47:45 Next you'll be holding up Venezuela as an oil rich country
2231 2018-08-05 18:47:37 That would hold true with most any other situation of this sort.   Why not here?   Because the law and the Constitution don't have any provisions for it.   

I guess that the founding fathers could not imagine a populace that would be foolish enough to elect a snake oil salesman.
2232 2018-08-05 18:47:28 This is the same guy who for years touted prosperity gospel on the trinity broadcasting network and the Christian broadcasting network. He’s a sham and a snake oil salesmen
2233 2018-08-05 18:47:23 Yeah it's delicious! My sister in law does it with her coffee and coconut oil and almond milk. You get the most foam@if you make sure to have 1-2 tbs of coconut oil in there.
2234 2018-08-05 18:47:23 my piano teacher suddenly rubbed the back of my neck and it turns out she rubbed peppermint oil on my neck to keep me cool ;___; today is a good day
2235 2018-08-05 18:47:19 Those are actually made with garbanzo beans. it has chickpea flour water tapioca flour cassava flour olive oil apple cider vinegar sea salt guar gum
2236 2018-08-05 18:47:19 And we stopped joint military exercises with our allies for nothing then? For a snake oil salesman’s pitch? #TraitorTrump #DotardDonnie
2237 2018-08-05 18:47:05 @_PVRCinemas Please buy Oil of Rs.600 = 2 Popcorns Only and put in the Hinges of the seats in Cinema Hall. I went to PVR Icon in Pune today and the seats were making noise everytime someone moves an inch on their chairs.. PVR is known for standards, plz Maintain!!
2238 2018-08-05 18:46:58 We extended our hair by not washing it as often but when you first do this it gets really greasy before it evens out. I think there's like "no 'poo" products you can buy? Or any shampoo without sulfates. Also a boar brush distributes the oil from your scap to your tips.
2239 2018-08-05 18:46:41 Coconut oil! It’s good for when the sea/heat makes your hair dry, heat rash, swelling from bites, sun burn, literally EVERYTHING!! #BloggerLoveShare
2240 2018-08-05 18:46:06 Ayer fuimos a la oil jajajaja re locos con Cristian y por aya nos atiende la piba y el otro me dice “ Brenda que te paso “ y me morí boluda
2241 2018-08-05 18:46:03 The oil/gas companies should pay their full 7%, like other states tax, or go somewhere else and drill. Taxes don't determine where oil companies drill, they go where the easy oil is, OK!
2242 2018-08-05 18:45:58 It’s not a good idea keeping lotion next to my lube. I almost rubbed gun oil all over my legs
2243 2018-08-05 18:45:49 I am a a southern girl too, two things I would like to share w/you. There is no such thing as Vegetable Oil  veggies don’t produce oil!! I researched it! Use peanut, avocado &olive also your using your lemon squeezer upside down, flip your  so the flesh is up! Way easier 
2244 2018-08-05 18:45:36 Thank you bring the coconut oil !
2245 2018-08-05 18:45:34 چرا روغن نباتی
2246 2018-08-05 18:45:30 Random thought. Why don’t we have carnival insurance? For when the revellera wine on your fence and mash it down or  dent up the car or throw mud oil or paint on property?
2247 2018-08-05 18:45:11 Lmao I have 3b/c hair (it’s two different textures it happened after my second pregnancy idk) and it’s not that hard to deal with! Just moisturise with a good crème while it’s wet (I like Shea Moisture with coconut) and an oil in between washes. She shouldn’t wash but once a week
2248 2018-08-05 18:45:08 Yardsaleing today and I’m finding antique kitchen stuff. I’ve currently bought olive oil dispensers, glass cake dish, and a 1960s roasting pan (light teal). 

All I need now is a small cottage by a lake or wooded area and I can live out my next 60 years in peace
2249 2018-08-05 18:44:54 I hate how tea tree oil smells
2250 2018-08-05 18:44:53 the fact that @KellyBands1 son put coconut oil all around the damn tub and I almost died
2251 2018-08-05 18:44:48 Oil yourself
2252 2018-08-05 18:44:46 Hot pan, olive oil, okra then zucchini then squash then eggplant, give it an hour on low heat, then butter then tomato paste, red wine vinegar then a healthy pinch of saffron, give it a half hour then another pour of olive oil, put on very low heat, parboil Ted potatoes, then
2253 2018-08-05 18:44:36 Some people soak in milk more than one way to skin a cat. 

Me? Kosher salt to suck out water-Dale’s or Montreal Steak seasoning, olive oil and a hot grill! Even better in a cold salad tomorrow baby!!
2254 2018-08-05 18:44:29 They don't need, or want, our fucking help. We need to leave them alone, leave their oil alone, stop meddling in their politics, and let them live the way they have for centuries if that's what they want.
2255 2018-08-05 18:44:25 I think about this all the time. I was working in the oil industry in 2008 when 80% of the country’s fortunes were disappearing- while oils was rising. It was shocking how easy people found it to tune out people outside of that bubble.
2256 2018-08-05 18:44:25 Baby oil got my skin feeling gOiD lol
2257 2018-08-05 18:44:04 And we now have green infrastructure in place that will continue to pay dividends into the future. Also, cost has continued to drop and efficiency has continued to increase. It is called investment and it is no different than oil throughout the 20th century
2258 2018-08-05 18:43:57 Either somebody’s bullshitting us about the number of Trump supporters and the snake oil they’re inhaling or some serious scientists are champing at the bit to get some in-depth psychological, sociological studies underway.

2260 2018-08-05 18:43:26 Why do you think the foolish virgins didn’t bring enough oil to last them to the coming of the Bridegroom?
2261 2018-08-05 18:43:20 Forty, picking his nail colors, rompers, and beard oil, one season at a time. MY GUY!
2262 2018-08-05 18:43:16 Colombia and Venezuela diverge after WW1. Because of oil. That's it.
2263 2018-08-05 18:43:02 Bro, hope we're still good sir. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding the last time.
2264 2018-08-05 18:43:02 I remember when everyone was told Saddam had WMD, that Iraqi oil would pay for the invasion, that Saddam was responsible for 9/11. They lied. I wish more people would realize the liars use the credulous to pave the way to fulfilling the liars' goals, that it's their MO.
2265 2018-08-05 18:43:01 These arms and belly fat got to go y'all.
Any suggestions ladies?

I'm starting a cumin oil diet what about you?
2266 2018-08-05 18:42:49 lol even if my nigga did cheat and I gave him a baby oil ass whopping I wouldn’t live to tell the story 
2267 2018-08-05 18:42:24 กังวลมาก
2268 2018-08-05 18:42:22 I thought I needed to run and find somebody to love, but all I needed was some coconut oil. -A proverb from Lizzo
2269 2018-08-05 18:42:22 Now now. The vegetable oil in which they fry their pork skins counts as a vegetable. 
2270 2018-08-05 18:42:18  I’ll just stick to castor oil thanks 
2271 2018-08-05 18:42:17 You only love me because my skin soft and I smell like shea butter and coconut oil 
2272 2018-08-05 18:42:16 Creme of nature argan oil perfect edges extra hold. Works on me for like an hour (longest I've experience tbh) also the best shine I've ever got. You have like 3 curls so the hold would probably last like three months.
2273 2018-08-05 18:42:12 Olive oil pancakes sound terrible. =\
2274 2018-08-05 18:42:08 Alaskans own 103,246 shares of GRUPA LOTOS SA, worth $1,423,624. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in POLAND.
2275 2018-08-05 18:41:43 (In another reality)
Me: LOL! I think I found oil. 
Prince: How's your mom? 
Me: I love it!

*kills me*

2276 2018-08-05 18:41:41 Shet iba talaga epekto ng eficascent oil pag may sakit. No wonder it's a school clinic staple. Kaya pati sa tyan yun ang gamit (kahit dapat alcamforado/aceite/manzanilla).

And oh, this minty thing doesn't dry the skin but when it dries, it's non greasy. 12/10 would recommend.
2277 2018-08-05 18:41:38 Enough oil?
2278 2018-08-05 18:41:36 By having PTI government in center, KP government will face no hindrance in projects of hydel power, oil & gas, circular railway etc
2279 2018-08-05 18:41:35 God bless you!! thank you ! i've been using a lot of argon oil treatments but ima try those !
2280 2018-08-05 18:41:17 Omega Oil been ordained lol
2281 2018-08-05 18:41:13 If we vote PDP in that could not achieve anything when Oil was N175 per barrell, 

What will they do when it is 75? 

We are quick to forget that the Naira fell by 600% in the 8 years of OBJ's rule when oil prices were at record highs.
2282 2018-08-05 18:41:10 Now, the tax payers are paying the money for a hedge, and now that the oil prices are well over $60/barrel, we will have to suffer the full brunt of the increase...how does the misspending of this money benefitting us today?  

Ask your Minister that when next you see him.
2283 2018-08-05 18:40:59 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2284 2018-08-05 18:40:59 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
2285 2018-08-05 18:40:53 I’m hoping he’s disappointed about not seeing the baby oil whooping like I was because that’s the only logical explanation for his answer 
2286 2018-08-05 18:40:48 Thank jon for the PSA. Mineral oil next try?
2287 2018-08-05 18:40:41 Bullshit the US has an oil industry agenda and the oil industry is still pissed about nationalization. Trump and the CIA work for big oil and greed
2288 2018-08-05 18:40:38 You know you’re getting old when your fam asks you what you want for your bday and your like money to a bill or an oil change or new tires 
2289 2018-08-05 18:40:32 Love me some @MsMyaG she was great, looks, personality, ect..  I wish they didn't do all that oil scenes tho lol
2290 2018-08-05 18:40:22 It came to my sister in law’s attention that i wanted to start to paint a canvas but i kept failing miserably so she went out of her way to get me oil based markers  i love ha!!
2291 2018-08-05 18:40:20 That would be swell, presuming temperatures drop to 50 or so by then.  Love tomatoes and mozz with basil, olive oil, and balsamic.  We have that for dinner weekly during tomato season.
2292 2018-08-05 18:40:11 Permanent workers will understand when business is down the option it's a better option to be retained as a part time worker on reduced pay than outright lay off ...I've experienced this scenario when the oil boom went bust ...no hard feelings. .but things eventually improve
2293 2018-08-05 18:40:07 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
2294 2018-08-05 18:40:03 True story: after church I took my wife’s van to get the oil changed...and I missed my baby’s first steps bc I was at @Valvoline
2295 2018-08-05 18:39:52 For best results, be sure to shake really (really) well and hold the bottle a good 12"-18" away from your face. If you still notice spots, pat gently with a damp Beauty Blender before it dries down. You can also try using prior to makeup for amazing oil control. Let us know!
2296 2018-08-05 18:39:51 Nope. The funders of this prop are heavily invested in major oil companies. They would keep prices the same (the market is already bearing it!) and just pocket more profit for themselves. Then drill more oil off the coast of California.
2297 2018-08-05 18:39:41 independent research states that once Mr. Drumpf spews nonsense, his staff dies a slow emotional death
2298 2018-08-05 18:38:51 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
2299 2018-08-05 18:38:41 South Africa is bigger than Nigera depending on oil price at the time of print
2300 2018-08-05 18:38:30 Rosehip oil is supposed to be really good for minimizing the showing of scars. Maybe try to do some massages with it often.
2301 2018-08-05 18:38:29 I have a friend right here in SC whose daughter’s seizures are only controlled by the oil. Imagine not going to NY for the prescription....imagine helping and saving our own.....
2302 2018-08-05 18:38:18 Currently doing independent research on Brazil's state owned oil company, PetroBras. If anyone could point me to research work done on this institution, would be eternally grateful. Preferably on their business model and diversification of petroleum products.
2303 2018-08-05 18:38:06 I really hate the way oil feels on my palms, that's my issue
2304 2018-08-05 18:38:06 Oil wealth = more irresponsible socialism
2305 2018-08-05 18:38:01 D is fat soluble so my MD recommended  taking with or after a fat like avocado or olive oil to get full benefit. :)
2306 2018-08-05 18:38:00 These look like essential oil diffusers
2307 2018-08-05 18:37:22 院試の問題クソ簡単すぎて逆に心配になるレベルなんやけど教授も必死で拾おうとするんやろーか
2308 2018-08-05 18:37:14 It breaks my heart that I can't put oil on my face 
2309 2018-08-05 18:36:58 It was a PNP policy, so if they were the govt it is likely that they would have put a new hedge at the current oil prices, which remained in the $40s for a very long time.

Now that oil prices are well over $60/barrel, we would have been benefitting to the tune of $20/barrel.
2310 2018-08-05 18:36:57 I make sure whenever I go out in the sun I put sunscreen on very important because it prevents dark spots and blemishes 
Use a good face moisturizer not a normal all in one moisturizer
I use a bit of coconut oil or jojoba oil very nice for the skin
2311 2018-08-05 18:36:42 Can’t wait to stock this 
2312 2018-08-05 18:36:35 @AlfredoPedulla hi big Alfredo i want some of your good tuna oil
2313 2018-08-05 18:36:03 If it’s any consolation, it’s still made with soybean oil, so it’ll probably taste like the mayo that you’re used to.

(I never sought to become the Cliff Clavin of mayo, but I have a soy allergy and 99% of mayos use soybean oil. So I’m always on the lookout for one without soy.)
2314 2018-08-05 18:35:56 Seventeen magazine lied to me in hs, just because you have oily skin doesn’t mean you should be drying it out with harsh foaming cleansers and avoiding oil products that lock in moisture!!!!
2315 2018-08-05 18:35:51 Because I don’t want socialism is America. I live here. By the way, have you checked on things in Venezuela recently? That much $$ from oil controlled by the state and the people are starving. Because of this shit idea that govt can match the free market in production. Horseshit
2316 2018-08-05 18:35:51 How can we cap the burning oil well when all we have is a pair of earrings, twenty cups of vinegar and a convenient roll-on deodorant?
2317 2018-08-05 18:35:48 An uplifting facial mask, pastel cobalt blue, with beetle mica, ylang ylang oil, and exfoliating ruby dust. The tube it comes in is cut-glass.
2318 2018-08-05 18:35:40 Exactly! All the more reason to treat it with respect & conserve it; not waste it out our tail pipe at Timmy’s drive thru for a $2 coffee! ICE vehicles waste most energy on pointless heat. With billions of human monkeys, we need be far more efficient if we want oil & gas to last
2319 2018-08-05 18:35:11 Pro tip if you try don’t fill the oil past halfway and only do small batches as to not pull too much heat out of your oil.
2320 2018-08-05 18:35:08 Next week: Millennials aren’t buying houses because they’re buying avocado oil mayo!
2321 2018-08-05 18:35:07 No one. Leave them alone, stop installing strongmen to repress the population, and let them become rich the Saudi way, or choose not to. And if they choose not to, we respect it and their oil stays in the ground, and let them live their own way. Where we get oil is our problem.
2322 2018-08-05 18:34:32 It’s weird to watch a bunch of snake oil salesmen steal the country with old grifts.
2323 2018-08-05 18:34:18 はいでたよ早漏
2324 2018-08-05 18:34:07 A timer (for pomodoro-style writing periods); a gel wrist-rest for typing; a yoga mat or something similar for stretching;  something that smells good if the person responds well to those things (I spent a lot of time sniffing lavender oil while dissertating); a planner.
2325 2018-08-05 18:33:59 334
2326 2018-08-05 18:33:45 We have taken to making our own. All you really need is a food processor and a plastic squeeze bottle to drip the oil in slowly. It tastes better than anything at the store and you can flavor it however you want (garlic, herbs, etc.)
2327 2018-08-05 18:33:45 ฮืออออออ เห็นไม่เห็นไม่รู้ แต่บ้ายบายไว้ก่อน ความสบายใจของนว้องงง55555
2328 2018-08-05 18:33:37 Besides the only difference between Colombia or Ecuador and Venezuela is oil.
2329 2018-08-05 18:33:33 There are areas of USA where Christians still hunger for power, the evangelicals and creationists still going strong but snake oil salesman the lot of them only in it for the $ and not a cohesive movement like the Moslems just individual preachers making a buck or millions.
2330 2018-08-05 18:33:33 @hmeisler Saw the "deep fried STL Ravioli" again.  Not that I'm afraid to deep fry.  Just what in the devil do you do with the oil, later.
2331 2018-08-05 18:33:04 Your argument seems to suggest that the JLP govt, could not renegotiate a new hedge since the term of the first one expired...

Is that so?  Who said the govt had to negotiate the same term for a new hedge when the price of oil was in the $40/barrel?
2332 2018-08-05 18:33:01 Water oil butter  and pray my bum ass daddy didn’t leave me with bad genes.
2333 2018-08-05 18:32:49 Salesman is right, with 'snake oil' put before it.
2334 2018-08-05 18:32:46 Amin ya Allah
2335 2018-08-05 18:32:36 Costco has a very nice avocado oil mayo, better than soybean oil, but it is not "reduced fat" - that's some kind of mayonnaise bullshit right there.
2336 2018-08-05 18:32:22 #RMP have a look at. Great notes by Afzal. Next to biggest oil find in last 30years of US. Talking billions in that find.
2337 2018-08-05 18:32:00 What about crude oil
2338 2018-08-05 18:31:58 Call me a make up freak or whatever, but I absolutely LOVE Maybelline New York Fit Me 230 natural buff foundation. Matches my skin tone perfectly at the moment, but I do get lighter in fall and winter. I have this complex skin. When I'm lighter I use Covergirl 205, its oil free
2339 2018-08-05 18:31:56 ฮือออออ ได้ใช้อากาศร่วมกันแล้วน้าาา ถึง พน.จะไม่ได้ไปหาาา แต่ก็จะเป็นทีมหน้าจอที่ดี กลับมาจาก รร.จะรีบเข้าทวิตเลยยย!!!  #WelcomeEXOtoThailand ได้ใช้สักที ฝันดีน่ะค้าาาาาา
2340 2018-08-05 18:31:44 it's a huge variable, fried up with onion and garlic, then onto toast, perhaps a soup with a truffle oil glaze, fried with onion. garlic, a little white wine, some cream and tarragon on pasta, 
If I have my wee stove when out, i'll cook them with bacon lardons & eat from the pan
2341 2018-08-05 18:31:43 Psalms 23:5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
Psalms 23:6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
2342 2018-08-05 18:31:31 I'm getting too old. I thought that was new school when American Oil Co. rebranded stations from the dark green AMOCO signage to red/white/blue American. Seems like just yesterday to me. The photo even has the new style, modern (to me) pumps.
2343 2018-08-05 18:31:17 Dairy is a big aggravator if you're prone to acne for sure.  Also fish oil is called the acne cure so take two in the morning and 2 at night

2346 2018-08-05 18:31:13 Can it manually set & maintain temperature? If you can heat oil to 350° yes.
2347 2018-08-05 18:31:09 Pro: Do they have a neutral mechanic here today?

Me: Why what do you need? (Thinking I could help a stranger)

Pro: Oh I just haven’t ridden this thing since nationals and I need to take the number plate off and oil the chain

Me: ... *I walked right TF into that*

2354 2018-08-05 18:30:11 I was talking about this with my sister the other day; we remember the many, many, many products our mother used to clean with--I'm good with water, white vinegar, homemade orange oil, maybe some tea tree oil.

2360 2018-08-05 18:29:28 One of the ways to remove Vitamin D if you take too much is through a spoon cup of vegetable oil as it’s a fat soluable.  Eating too much fat probably contributes to D deficiencies.
2361 2018-08-05 18:29:13 and then add canned chili oil, and probably call it something stupid
2362 2018-08-05 18:29:10 The economy of the United States started showing positive signs after Barack Obama's administration produced and exceeded US Crude Oil demands for the first time in the history of the Country!

White House should tell Americans one thing Trump has done to achieve economic growth!
2363 2018-08-05 18:28:59 So besides the fact my a/c started to leak , my gas finished , I got burnt from hot oil and my room getting soaked ... I got my oil down with stew chicken fried plantain and zaaaaboooocaaaaa

2365 2018-08-05 18:28:41 Come to think of it we should stop exporting by boat save the ocean from oil spills stop the train as well no more derailments ,start growing our one food and stick to our own backyards make the world a safer place

2371 2018-08-05 18:27:50 @lasiguanas recently changed to vegan diet, wanted to order sweet potato fries which are marked vegetarian on your menu. Told by server that they are not vegan as they are cooked in same oil as everything else which wouldn't even make them vegetarian!#disappointing!
2372 2018-08-05 18:27:49 It's not bad. Same with the Olive Oil version. Definitely doesn't taste the same as regular mayo. More importantly...

DID YOU BRING YOUR ID?
2373 2018-08-05 18:27:11 What this thread suggests is that there is not much difference between Harper and Trudeau on the #environment file. Both are captured by Big Oil  interests.

2375 2018-08-05 18:27:00 Hmm, if the allegations about not showing id are true, then this is fucked up. All other things aside. Procedure matters. Rule of law matters. I'm not saying this guy should have walked, just saying Leo's should follow the rules or be punished.
2376 2018-08-05 18:26:53 Isn't a big  factor that they had a lot of money coming in then crude oil went drastically down?
2377 2018-08-05 18:26:33 Going in the seize the worlds richest oil reserves.
2378 2018-08-05 18:26:30 Lord, You comfort all who mourn. You give them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning. And they (God's people) will repair the ruined city of Redding. Send the rain. Amen!
2379 2018-08-05 18:26:18 Or we could just shut off the oil taps and see how you do without any oil from your largest supplier....  it wouldn't take long to end the trade war and get NAFTA signed.
2380 2018-08-05 18:26:04 when I see Tom Cotton making the rounds--Las Vegas, Dallas, Houston, Palm Beach--filling his war chest with money from the casino bosses, oil tycoons and hedge fund managers, believe me, I know what your up against on a national level, plus all the local folklore you have to face
2381 2018-08-05 18:25:40 Any Suave brand conditioner. Squeeze half the bottle into a bowl.

Add...

1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 tablespoon honey. Mix.

Coat locs, massage into scalp. Pull locs into ponytail and cover with plastic cap (for longer hair, use a Walmart bag).

Sit under dryer 15 minutes. 
2382 2018-08-05 18:25:28 Yes lol. Girrrl long story but I left a pan of oil on I guess. I had forgot. I was outside having a good time and we kept hearing an alarm go off and turned out to our apt lol. I walked in and freaked out. Grabbed the pan and it spilled and hit my foot lol.

2387 2018-08-05 18:25:00 Oil pimp, that’s precious. If the @liberal_party gov’t had any true conviction in their support of pipelines they would have kept some dry powder instead of quashing the other projects. Just another knee jerk reaction from a gang of idiots that can’t shoot straight.
2388 2018-08-05 18:24:45 I had a really scary migraine yesterday, but after sleeping for 12 hours and dousing myself in essential oil and water, I feel like myself again
2389 2018-08-05 18:24:41 I don't mean to be crude BUT They must really want that oil
2390 2018-08-05 18:24:34 Inspiring!
My parents were painters. Dad in oil, Mom, watercolour.
As a photographer I never quite felt I was a TRUE artist.
4 years ago my father passed away (at 90) and I was given all of his painting gear. I've only done 1 painting so far.

2392 2018-08-05 18:24:23 @jkenney Further to  minimum wages this has happened in the middle of our oil recession and is killing us! When we elect you Mr. Kenney please don't forget us businesses and keep your word and beliefs you held as head of the taxpayers association. We need HELP; lower min wages!

2394 2018-08-05 18:24:00 I'm sorry to hear.  I too have lost family members to cancer. And there are good alternatives that really help. For example, vitamin B17 and CBD oil, but that makes less money.
2395 2018-08-05 18:23:59 Cops harassed and searched a 20 year old I met yesterday because a megaplex staff member complained about them vaping cbd oil in the bathroom. They were extremely rude and threatening and incited a panic attack. Fuck the staffmember and fuck those cops.
2396 2018-08-05 18:23:50 What kinda cooking oil do y’all use?
2397 2018-08-05 18:23:32 We are hoping one day to reduce his inflammation with the oil that reduces inflammation , right now all we can do to relieve his pain is opiates.
2398 2018-08-05 18:23:18 Not only do pipelines destroy valuable land, but they're also a danger to Indigenous women. Between 2010-2013 sex crime rates have doubled in the "man camps" set up near the Bakken formation in ND. The influx of temporary oil workers poses a significant threat.

2401 2018-08-05 18:22:21 I’m getting my oil changed and literally every single person in this bay is going to or graduated from #WKU! 

...but only one of us was the mascot. 
2402 2018-08-05 18:22:10 Facts develop, what a joke. I hope it was worth your career and reputation to represent this snake oil salesman, Donald Trump. Does Mueller scare you, he should...
2403 2018-08-05 18:22:09 Facts are, with a little investment and scientific American ingenuity, we could turn that crap back into oil and sell it at a profit!
2404 2018-08-05 18:22:06 @SRuhle With announcement of OPEC pumping record barrels of oil right now does that mean DT is about to do something really really stupid in Iran?

2410 2018-08-05 18:20:50 Am told the main concern is sanctions on Iran and thus restricted oil flow - this plus the terrorists.  Other than this, appears to be no foreign policy.

2419 2018-08-05 18:19:48 I’m going to make a packet of oil cleanse wipes for my clients to buy. I notice when we do glitter looks, they always say their usual face soap doesn’t do the job, which it wouldn’t. So let’s just make it easier.

You can get away with a lot of stupid policies when money falls from the sky. Copper isn’t as lucrative and cane sugar even less so. You have to keep your craziness in check. 1/2

2433 2018-08-05 18:17:48 I wonder why? Could it be that the people are starving and the entire population are losing weight. Or is it because the country is floating on oil & the American Oil Companies have pulled out their infrastructure.
2434 2018-08-05 18:17:46 But science as a whole has proven and accepted it and moved on to trying to reverse it. The concept of it not being proven is a uniquely American thing based on oil company's involvement in politics. In all other 1st world nations it is as accepted as any other part of science.

2448 2018-08-05 18:15:52 It just shows his hypocrisy. Some the most powerful & richest people in the World are Arabs whose fortune comes from oil & investment. Even Yasser Arafat left around $11m to his daughter who lives in luxury in Paris while his followers live in poverty

2453 2018-08-05 18:14:55 Still a bit pricey for an oil rag
2454 2018-08-05 18:14:49 No it is known that Shell & BP are, but mostly in Europe.  Even in these cases they are not selling Shell generated electrons.  Oil companies can not stay afloat running energy stations selling the energy of others.

2460 2018-08-05 18:14:24 Yeah!!! If you're lucky you can find things like oil roll-ons too in certain stores

I like those myself. Idk the feeling of rolling the oil onto my wrists and sniffing it just helps a lot. Lotion is also good idea! 

And I'm glad to help 
2461 2018-08-05 18:14:20 Roughly a month ago, the Russian MoD issued a propaganda alert regarding an ostensible "false flag chemical weapons attack" in Jafra, DeZ - either Jafra town or the oil field nearby.

Obviously, no CWMD usages occurred, but does anyone know if anything panned out in this area?

2470 2018-08-05 18:13:04 They didn't hedge because the PNP put it in place, so they didn't want it to succeed.  Plus, they needed more money to finance their 1.5. Since oil prices were down they didn't see any need to continue with it.

2473 2018-08-05 18:13:00 It’s a godsend for me. I don’t have to plan anything. Everything you need for each recipe is in the box. The only things they don’t give you are salt, pepper, sugar, butter and vegetable oil.
2474 2018-08-05 18:12:57 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord -James 5:14
2475 2018-08-05 18:12:24 Hahahahahaha teringat pula oil cleanser aku dah habis takde walaupun setitik pun hahahahahaha
2476 2018-08-05 18:11:52 Tbs tea tree oil face scrub 3x 
Erha friendly sunscreen 3x 
Gold serum 2x
2477 2018-08-05 18:11:40 well that too. oil even in a down market definitely beats sugar (or copper)
2478 2018-08-05 18:11:00 Plug just try to hustle me for free oil lmao nah bro I'm a real one
2479 2018-08-05 18:10:49 It is sad, the politics of oil, with a few more than the 1.2% of the otherwise virtually unused Sahara we could desalinate enough water for crops to feed a planet twice the size of this one.
2480 2018-08-05 18:10:47 I like it. I use the oil control one and I love it. My skin feels clean and not dry out
2481 2018-08-05 18:10:46 5 things you should never waste. 
1) peoples’ willingness to learn
2) peoples’ time 
3) coconut oil 
4)avocado 
5) a good hair day.
2482 2018-08-05 18:10:45 Don’t over use peppermint oil. It’s also a drying oil it can make it brittle
2483 2018-08-05 18:10:30 I agree the oil belongs to Somali people in Ogaden. When you get richer, we get rich.

2485 2018-08-05 18:10:16 So it’s “Salad Week” in my household! I’m kicking it off with this one: 

Steak Salad topped with Pepperjelly Dressing and Avocado Garlic Citrus Oil.  What do you think? 
2486 2018-08-05 18:10:05 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
2487 2018-08-05 18:09:52 Iran is run by religious zealots.
They know nothing about economics and depend on their oil supplies. 
US sanctions will hurt them badly and could force them into drastic  action.
Many Iranians want change and there could be a new revolution.
2488 2018-08-05 18:09:48 power to finance govts commitments to large industry that they will get electricity for <USD$0.06/kWh AND get all of the oil and gas they use for a major, major discounts off market prices. Sweden uses CO2 tax revenues to finance the removal of excise tax from industrial  ...6.
2489 2018-08-05 18:09:36 have agreat day tomorrow Heid ,tell them about the T shirt
2490 2018-08-05 18:09:29 Now the govt is selling the Venezuelan people’s future with bad long term oil & gas, ports, etc deals to the Russians and Chinese.  The level of corruption and poverty is beyond comprehension to those, particularly N. Americans, who haven’t seen Venz before and after socialism.
2491 2018-08-05 18:09:13 US joins Ireland as a #GreenCountry by transitioning to coal-free energy as of 2025.  Other countries follow, and global warming levels out... economic power of oil states diminishes. This hits Putin in the pocket book, but no one is paying much attn to him, anyway... #AlternateU
2492 2018-08-05 18:09:03 What exact kind of oil did you use? Speaking from experience, my olive oil made it taste terrible! I never tried again!!!
2493 2018-08-05 18:09:01 Good they have more support. Russia should remain Russia,China should remain China & let Taiwan make own decision & US should remain US, do 1 oil pipeline across Syria together, share profits with highest % going to Syria, have a drink or 2 together & leave each other be. #Peace
2494 2018-08-05 18:09:00 lol, when we see the biggest piece of junk on the road spewing black oil exhaust we yell Trumper!
2495 2018-08-05 18:08:57 She's a fraud there's no such thing as democrat socialist she's a socialist total distinguishable there's NEVER been a country that was successful with socialist rule example Venezuela which use to be one of richest countries with oil reserves in abundance now ppl no food riots
2496 2018-08-05 18:08:37 I missed yesterday (sorry for #living) but happy day 36 of your friendly (almost) daily reminder that rick scott didn’t expand health care to the very people who need it most - the poor and disabled - while he took oil, gas, and kremlin money to line his $500 million bank account
2497 2018-08-05 18:08:37 Also, who said the govt was to hedge under the same term and condition as the one before?  They would hedge based on current condition and the oil prices fell to the region of $40/barrel.  So, used the taxes and hedge at that price, nuh?
2498 2018-08-05 18:08:09 I affirm it rsrsrs. Either it was an auto attempt or any other weird thing. Venezuela is quite bankrupt due to lowest oil prices and corruption
Inflation is 46% a year and getting worse
2499 2018-08-05 18:07:44 Ack! If it was for the 'healthy choice', should have been coconut oil! D'oh! #BB20

2502 2018-08-05 18:07:12 Strange that Trump would cite England in the 1970's; when the United States was going through, what Time Magazine called the Lost Decade. GOP President, Richard Nixon was responsible for Trashing Dollar; Oil Embargos, Wage & Price Controls and, a Recession of huge magnitude.
2503 2018-08-05 18:06:55 Still 3x cleaner than fossils. Don't forget the electric required to refine oil and everything back up the supply chain.

That's why it taste funky
Low heat and butter and garlic

2517 2018-08-05 18:04:17 Thought oil shaw had arguably his best game for Hibs today. Held the ball up really well
2518 2018-08-05 18:04:10 I doubt there has been a nation bestowed with so much wealth (world’s most oil & gas, iron ore, bauxite, gold, diamonds, hydroelect power, etc), that has failed its people more miserably than Venezuela. That is the reality of history; however you want to spin it. I’ve been there.
2519 2018-08-05 18:04:07 The Anthropocene Epoch is real and man induced. Environmental bad news that Trump is allowing harmful pesticides that damage pollinators. So many issues, what about the co's doing it bc its legal, we can boycott them or the co's going to explore oil in Arctic. F em. Save life.
2520 2018-08-05 18:04:02 Successfully treated his terminal rectal cancer with cannabis oil, did he? Apparently his arsehole is in such prime condition now that he can successfully talk out of it.

2522 2018-08-05 18:03:58 Venezuela was build as a rich nayion with the oil at $10 USD the barrel. Why the collapse now? Kleptocracy.

2525 2018-08-05 18:03:03 That's not socialism. 
That's the result of building a economy that depended on oil prices too much and tried to compensate the price drop with printing money
It's an inflation of epic proportions
That would have ruined capitalistic nations just the same 
So the criticism is 
2526 2018-08-05 18:02:53 America be like:

2527 2018-08-05 18:02:49 I feel so good today! I hope ur all having an amazing Sunday. Pop on a face mask, oil ur cuticles, read a favorite piece from 1 of ur favorite books. Anything that makes U happy in the slightest bit. Do it.
2528 2018-08-05 18:02:43 Plenty of poor workmanship about that nothing is done about regarding Gas and Oil so if that is not enforced then I am doubtful water regs will be either. Water regs have really only been pointed out to me by water board employees checking new build properties.

2536 2018-08-05 18:01:57 Just for your info, fellow #trade geeks like @CoppetainPU and @DmitryOpines have debunked this, and probably others as well. I find your description, snake oil, quite adequate.
2537 2018-08-05 18:01:52 Gonna try jojoba oil + tea oil on my face for a week and see..
2538 2018-08-05 18:01:48 How do you cook with an app? I find it so annoying, especially because I'm a terrible cook.

- screen keeps turning off or it dies
- my hands are messy from oil 
- so hard to find a place to put it
2539 2018-08-05 18:01:47 Do chicks dig the smell of fresh cut grass, used engine oil, and sweat? Asking for a friend....
2540 2018-08-05 18:01:47 I choose hijab. It protects my hair from dust. Hijab absorbs the sweat from my forehead & oil in my hair. Hijab because it keeps hair out of my face without fussing w/ a hair tie or hair products. Hijab because the absorption keeps me cool from daytime heat & warm on cold nights.
2541 2018-08-05 18:01:46 now that you didn't take the advice are you happy with the hopeless life the Turkana people are facing ? Your take on the oil deal?
2542 2018-08-05 18:01:39 What non-dewy setting sprays do y’all use?
My skin is oily and the maybelline master fix is waaaaaaaay too dewy, it does nothing for oil control.
2543 2018-08-05 18:01:36 We are talking bout IGR. Lagos houses more than 60% of the headquarters of multinationals and all these states are oil producing states .
2544 2018-08-05 18:01:29 No not back till november sadly.
2545 2018-08-05 18:01:25 There shouldn't be a world police at all, least of all a western country policing Africa and the Middle East after colonialism. The west should stop trying to swindle oil from the Middle East with its foreign policy. That's what created this whole shitstorm.
2546 2018-08-05 18:01:25 i did its been 3 days i used to have rly dry ass dandruff hair so i put oil in it and ever since i just have issues tbh imma have to dye it soon to fix this

2562 2018-08-05 17:59:18 There's a documentary on youtube about this guy, where he explains that he injects himself with oil. So basically his "muscles" are 99.99% oil.
2563 2018-08-05 17:59:12 when people have denied for years that climate change is happening & now deny that we have anything to do with it, their past ignoring of science should come back to haunt them. but as arnie says - renewable resources make sense in any event. burning more oil & coal doesn't
2564 2018-08-05 17:59:12 Putting gnocchi in a roasting tin is revolutionary!

2570 2018-08-05 17:58:12 I make delicious tea lattes at home. They're so good! It's usually earl grey, then I put a bunch of my herbal supplement powders in with coconut oil and plant-based milk. That goes in the blender and voila you've got the latte foam! We can drink those and bitch about MAGAts!
2571 2018-08-05 17:58:11 Is there any debate where the oily @ghanshyamtiwari doesn’t look and sound the village idiot that he? This character probably puts a pint of stinking cooking oil on his head to try and look smart but fails miserably so to do!
2572 2018-08-05 17:58:03 In Germany, the plastic bag seems to have conquered stores and supermarkets in the 60s. The very first ones were used for potatoes in the mid-fifties. But after the oil crisis in the 70s, the slogan "jute instead of plastic" became a mantra and plastic bags were now charged for.
2573 2018-08-05 17:58:01 The digital revolution seems, so far, much more benign than the effects of big oil. But the loss of trust that social media both causes and exploits may one day be seen as another form of unforgivable pollution.

2593 2018-08-05 17:54:42 The cost of shipping the products to market will go up because of the wage increase in the people who transport it. The cost of gas will go up because the cost of the wages for the oil workers will go up. People will start demanding that they get even more to keep them level.

2601 2018-08-05 17:53:39 Redneck idea of freedom is (with dumb accent) “I don’t need to recycle this oil! It came from the ground!” “Stupid communist EPA! I’ll just let it run down into the bayou back to the earth where it came from!” “#freedom”
2602 2018-08-05 17:53:39 I’m being told to go and get my oil changed???? which is an adult task?? the audacity...
2603 2018-08-05 17:53:17 Just a sad Heir Harpler remnant bought and paid for by the oil and gas industry !!
2604 2018-08-05 17:51:59 Mine too! That's why I am recommending it to you KDSAJKD. What helps with the oil is washing with just water. My skin improved a lot when I ditched all the shit. Of course, to remove makeup, you need a soap but in general.
2605 2018-08-05 17:51:43 If militarily targeted by US, Iran sure to target Arab Allies and its  oil tankers and refineries along the #StraitOfHormuz coast which will affect #OilTrade and supply for years to come. In turn, Iran will have to face  such destruction from which it may take ages to recover.
2606 2018-08-05 17:51:41 Pastor: turn and greet the people around you
*old guy in front of me turns around* : do you think that cannabis oil will make my joints move better?
2607 2018-08-05 17:51:39 Actually that was a big oil grab. The guy still has the car he put it on and here it is 2018 and the car is still running. He lives close to me and it was in a news article a year ago. We are old enough to remember that. BTW, if you think about it you will come up with a name "B"
2608 2018-08-05 17:51:36 “What’s your dream job?”

Me: “To wash the oil off the duck on the Dawn commercial”
2609 2018-08-05 17:51:36 It's a house of cards that will crumble soon. Unsustainable.
2610 2018-08-05 17:51:11 did i really just spilled all my coconut oil on the floor because i thought it was gonna be solid but forgot that it was in my bag all day and it melted because it’s fucking 36 degrees? the answer is yes, i absolutely did

2614 2018-08-05 17:50:51 Worked yesterday and then bought some Pineapple Express vape oil and it put me on my ass! Today, if I’m not grocery shopping for my mom’s lunches for the week, I’m gonna do some research and write my script for my first video report about the our bail system 
2615 2018-08-05 17:50:38 Even if the US goes at it alone, don’t most #oil majors like BP, Shell, Total, etc have policies that would prohibit the lifting of Iranian crude if sanctioned by the State Department? Most of these guys do business in US and can’t run afoul of American sanctions. Thoughts? #OOTT

2618 2018-08-05 17:49:54 I cleaned my house this morning, took my car for a car wash and now an oil change. Then I’m going to the grocery store and making dinner for my fam to come over. I’m kicking the adult life ass this morning.
2619 2018-08-05 17:49:48 Say sir you drank your castor oil, I can't see #America readily say yes, or no to your coming back into the fold but you will be scrutinized. Can you handle that?
2620 2018-08-05 17:49:37 Your lack of current historical facts is glaring. Go look up Israel. When and how it was formed in its current state. All the poor treaties it’s been forced to sign, mostly by us trying to keep the oil flowing. Look up Israel land for peace. How much have they given and betrayal.
2621 2018-08-05 17:49:31 I would kill to be Maddy's oil boy. 
2622 2018-08-05 17:49:30 Actually it was American Oil interests in the region that destabilized it and made it an anti American breeding ground

2627 2018-08-05 17:48:06 I hate when people do this, however, none of this is surprising.  Some of us begged the press to not normalize *any* of this during the election, to view it as the crisis it already was.  And yet Zucker and other "mavens" saw the Trump ratings bonanza like oil in the desert....
2628 2018-08-05 17:47:53 Im tired of this anxiety, ima invest on buying some hemp oil.
2629 2018-08-05 17:47:38 So? We get oil from Saudi don’t we? What makes you think us being out of a Union is going to stop trading between our government and these companies? Do you know anything about business?
2630 2018-08-05 17:47:28 Oil changed the way we understood the physical world, since distance on its own now no longer meant that anywhere was hard to reach.

2644 2018-08-05 17:45:31 The Russians also own the majority of their oil reserves since 2017
2645 2018-08-05 17:45:18 "Like the US has not tried to take other countries’ wealth? Ha."

Notoriously the US did it over oil, by arranging a regime change in... yes, Iran.
Operation Ajax.
I wonder why a certain hostility to US governments is found in Iranian governments?

2648 2018-08-05 17:45:04 I’m convinced it was the lavender essential oil diffusing during showings that sold my house in two days. Can’t say no to lavender.
2649 2018-08-05 17:44:59 Then your child shall be the one to deliver said 'special olive oil' from Italy.  Make sure you thrown some wine in the deal and encourage using lots of oil!  I wanna see how C60 effects Satan!
2650 2018-08-05 17:44:50 The meme is that the #UnitedStates wants to get rid of #Maduro. 1) Trump doesn’t care about the region, this is well known. 2) the US is self sufficient in oil production. 3) it still refines their oil. 4) he’s talked to #NorthKorea and maybe #Iran. #Venezuela? It is marginal.
2651 2018-08-05 17:44:48 The oil revolution accelerated the shrinkage of the physical world that coal-powered transport – steamships and railways – had started in the 19th century. Air travel and motor transport transformed peacetime economies and the means of waging war.

2654 2018-08-05 17:44:17 Gracias but I would like to become better at Spanish for sure. To complicate things...she’s the daughter of an American oil baron. And yes you’re right, but oddly it’s knowing her that made me pro Chavez (I’m maduro neutral)

2659 2018-08-05 17:43:37 네~!!!
2660 2018-08-05 17:43:24 There were very little oil revenues in the last three years . Don't you read the papers , thousands of oil workers paid off ,  I voted to stay with the UK . You got less Austerity  because we are a part of the UK  ,42,000 million pounds less Austerity thanks to the UK and Barnett
2661 2018-08-05 17:43:07 I think it was in Oliver Stone's docu about Chavez, how he went into a general store, confiscated it "for the people" and gave the owner a few weeks to get out. Maduro's doing the same with the oil for example and they sell it incompetently. Now 80% of Venezuelans live in poverty
2662 2018-08-05 17:43:01 Oh yes, Lord

2663 2018-08-05 17:42:58 Buffet makes money while he sleeps by buying up Canadia’s railroads and funding anti-pipeline protestors to keep mile-long, wasteful oil trains running. What’s amazing about this quote is Buffet can actually sleep at night with a compromised conscience.
2664 2018-08-05 17:42:55 Never start the war with Iran, because the price of gas and and oil will go up to the ceiling and Saudi Arabia will be attacked by the Iranians too.

2673 2018-08-05 17:42:21 I have found that every other week massage or reflexology and every other week accupuncture works.
I also take Turmeric for old age pain.
Not too much.
In addition essential oil aroma therapy and parrafin dip
2674 2018-08-05 17:41:20 Basically there wont be vehicles running in oil
2675 2018-08-05 17:41:10 I just sautéed a full pound of mushrooms in garlic and olive oil. I think I got five ounces of finished product. Damn teasing fungus...
2676 2018-08-05 17:41:01 my mom took my car in to get my tire patched & an oil change this morning. apparently they found a few other issues with the car, they said they could fix it for like $663. Thanks to my dad's tools and my competency, I can fix the issues myself, for not even 1/4 of the cost.

2679 2018-08-05 17:40:39 Are you trying to win over Newfoundlanders after telling them that Albertans are harder working and their oil industry is more important?

2683 2018-08-05 17:40:00 How many times have we recited Psalm 23, "you anoint my head with oil" without even thinking about what this expression actually means?
2684 2018-08-05 17:39:41 So who is buying #CBD oil now that every man woman and child in America is selling it?
2685 2018-08-05 17:39:40 Getting my oil changed and the guy just said..and I quote.. “wow I didn’t see your last name is Rockey. That is like so cute!”

2692 2018-08-05 17:38:18 Still haven’t contacted me!
Do not take you car to any Valvoline quick oil change. Had mine done and less than 20 minutes later my engine exploded. Tried to deal with them for some sort of compensation but they denied me and gave me the run around. Lou. KY!
2693 2018-08-05 17:38:15 Well, The tweet is factually wrong - Feds (CFR Title 21 Sec 169.120) say @MiracleWhip is not Mayo - the oil content is too low, and they add Sugar and disallowed spices.  May be good stuff, but it ain't "Mayonnaise" - so Kraft calls it "Salad Dressing" to sneak it by
2694 2018-08-05 17:37:40 Oil price will never go down as they will take 70% of it then yu must pay high tax also to earn a living in ur own country, Libya, Sudan, Nigeria an Ghana, Somalia cn supply whole afrika with oil an still supply colonisers. #FreeTradeAfrika our economy
2695 2018-08-05 17:37:35 Politicians regularly criticize banking, oil and gas, insurance, pharmaceuticals, technology, airlines, lawyers, education, police, gun manufacturing, pro sports, etc. Why should journalism be off limits... especially when it's so often unprofessional and lacking lacking?
2696 2018-08-05 17:37:31 I know i tried to put out a fire with oil and gas i just want to see the opinions

2698 2018-08-05 17:37:21 And how do you know this relates to oil production, and why do you think the oil companies are able to without anyone else knowing?
2699 2018-08-05 17:37:20 It is those close ties between the four main media hubs and the oil company oligarchs that gives me doubt in their objectivity. #someconspiraciesaretrue #warismoney
2700 2018-08-05 17:37:14 I don't add milk, but I basically just let the oil get hot, crack them, and pop the yolks. I wait till they're firm before I add seasoning or cheese. Even for omelettes. I find they cook better on a gas stove too.
2701 2018-08-05 17:36:52 I don't.. I don't apply oil that's it.. I do use powder when it's really shiny
2702 2018-08-05 17:36:45 Yes! My hair was horrible with having to use dry shampoo! I've just had a bath and put loads of oil on my hair lol
2703 2018-08-05 17:36:44 That's beard oil? I thought it was that iced tea what wasn't for sissies? I better call my doctor.
2704 2018-08-05 17:36:41 I had to go back to step one with my hair gel and oil. I got super distracted  and I don’t feel that. It wasn’t coming out the way I wanted anymore. #comingsoon
2705 2018-08-05 17:36:27 Oil money that mean the wealth lasts forever 
2706 2018-08-05 17:36:23 If only the people of Iran had held democratic elections at some point, every people deserves the right to self determination. Unless of course they nationalize their oil industry. O wait. Nvmnd....
2707 2018-08-05 17:36:15 Same reason petrol prices immediately after an increase in oil prices, and it takes while for petrol prices to drop when oil prices drop.

They're running a business not a charity.

Your arrogance is gargantuan.

Good spot.
2710 2018-08-05 17:35:46 One million percent!!! That’s how much they expect inflation to hit in Venezuela....let’s not forget it has one of the largest oil reserves on the planet.
2711 2018-08-05 17:35:38 My owner hasn't contacted me in the last 24 hours :( and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
2712 2018-08-05 17:35:20 Sure.

2717 2018-08-05 17:34:52 Hedging was one of the main reason business and int confidence was regained after the BG sold it out for Dudus. The thought that there would be stability if oil price increase on the int market was attractive

2719 2018-08-05 17:34:31 Theoretically, you would only need 45 million cubic meters of materials to manufacture enough polymer solar cells to supply the world's energy needs (15TW). This is equivalent to the amount of oil we use every 3 days.
2720 2018-08-05 17:34:27 Naalala ko yung tinitinda sa O shopping na Non-stick pan. Wala na daw kailangang oil pero nagluto lang ng itlog nagkadikit dikit sa pan.

OH CANADA You are so screwed.
2723 2018-08-05 17:34:12 Is this justification why you did war propaganda that led Bush to grab Iraq's oil?
2724 2018-08-05 17:34:02 Russia has hacked into the oil and gas infrastructure. Refineries, pipelines, chemical plants. If anyone in the government had bothered to look they would find them. However they are too busy with political agendas. SSDD

....means over 5 100,000 crude oil barrel marine tanker/barge shipments PER DAY from Superior, WI to Marysville-Sarnia during April to November shipping season, tanker truck shipments during winter.
2729 2018-08-05 17:33:29 And the oil barons read from the petronomicon.

2731 2018-08-05 17:33:10 It is estimated that Ven hilds the 2nd largest reserves of unconventional oil reserves in the world. US more than happy to supply and arm Saudi facist regime from the middle ages.

2737 2018-08-05 17:32:31 Nice work. I'd suggest doing a trial of "reduced sugar" products for non-diabetics (or even diabetics). Also in the future, replacing ghee (clarified butter) with canola oil. Good start, nevertheless
2738 2018-08-05 17:32:29 CBD oil saved my dog’s life when she was fighting off Parvo.

2741 2018-08-05 17:31:51 Brendyn has to shave his beard for a job he’s about to go on (I’m so happy the oil industry is making a comeback ) and I can hear him whimpering as he cuts it.

2747 2018-08-05 17:31:01 And we pray to God it fails as no one needs to smoke it to attain medical help.  They only need pills or the oil without the drug part in it.  The druggies in Oklahoma are pissed they can't smoke it to stay in a apathetic brain fog...

2760 2018-08-05 17:29:16 If sanctions are installed on him by US and its allies ie control of the barrel by the dollar and no export of the principle product. Of coarse the oil production would go down. No intelligence there.
2761 2018-08-05 17:29:15 @theresa_may why do lots of cars sound like they’re about to give out? Mine made the same sound....oil leak and water leak. It’s gone. Now I have to take the bus which on Saturday was nearly £5 there and back for a ten minute journey

2764 2018-08-05 17:29:02 Can't have olive oil either. She has a reaction and had to get a Prednosone shot and the doc said "Can't eat anything you had that night"
2765 2018-08-05 17:28:56 i’m sorry, maybe it was just the way i was raised, but in my opinion you shouldn’t be allowed to go in anywhere truck and trailer alone if you don’t know the basic mechanics like how to change a tire, use a jack, air a tire up, check your oil/coolant, etc...
2766 2018-08-05 17:28:51 the baby oil beat down
2767 2018-08-05 17:28:50 I’m so happy it’s working and if it wasn’t for you I probably would’ve been stressed right now. 

I’m over this weather too, even more now with this sudden wind. It’s just a few weeks till spring comes. We will both be producing enough oil to even fry eggs 
2768 2018-08-05 17:28:44 @realDonaldTrump Russia is not a friend as they've sold oil to N Korea avoiding the sanctions the U N has applied. Oil transfers at sea!!!!!

2770 2018-08-05 17:28:32 What an intellectual would look at is the cumulative processes that led to this decline.
- Over dependence on oil for one.
The diversification of the economy wil redistribute wealth to the people - not only dealers in oil wil get to be rich
A wise man would knw dat dis takes time

2778 2018-08-05 17:27:10 I polish my head years ago i had a barber use cut throat to cut my hair off. He thought it funny to firstly put aftershave on my head,which stung,and then baby oil.

2801 2018-08-05 17:24:34 Someone bring me food or I'll die. HOW DOES THIS BENEFIT PEOPLE WHO AREN'T OIL MONGERS.
2802 2018-08-05 17:24:31 I don't buy cars on finance because I don't like owing money on depreciating assets, I'd sooner spend 10 bags on the business I OWN & any car I drive I pay for in full & can fix it myself.

2813 2018-08-05 17:23:13 @farhan_MSU what are your thoughts on CBD oil? I’m looking into this to help the FIL and there is nothing that I’ve studied so far to lead me to believe it is haram. All the upside in terms of appetite stimulation, help with depression and anxiety with no side effects.
2814 2018-08-05 17:23:02 If we can afford to spend billions on oil & gas exploration, then we can afford the same on greener alternatives or at least spread out the investment to better diversify, stabilize, & prepare our future energy economy. I’m not against oil & gas; only against prolific waste of it
2815 2018-08-05 17:22:59 Why does it take 2 hours to get oil change with an appointment @CrownHondaSP ?

2823 2018-08-05 17:22:13 I think quinoa looks like bug eyes, when cooked.  Can't handle the white/yellow stuff.  BUT, I do like red quinoa.  It has a nuttier flavor to it that I like.  I also will toast it in the pan with just a touch of olive oil before adding the liquid to cook it.  YUMMY. #quinoa

2827 2018-08-05 17:21:19 The 70's were a difficult period - but not because of socialism. The 70's were punctuated by not 1 but 2 oil price driven recessions. Simultaneously the UK's captive colonial market had by then largely won independence and Asian industry was coming online.

2837 2018-08-05 17:20:19 The ones in Mt 7 hear, “I never knew you” but to the foolish virgins, He says, “I do not know you.” I believe the foolish virgins’ starting with oil suggests they formerly knew Him, but they fell away (Hb 6:4-6).

2858 2018-08-05 17:16:56 White paper and it’s dependence on oil was completely wrong. Growth commission report is an excellent argument that we are better off as we are - part of the UK. Also, benefits are far far more that just economists considerations, important though that is.
2859 2018-08-05 17:16:46 so I've been having pretty intense nightmares for the past week. I ordered an essential oil diffuser and some lavendar and I slept like a baby last night.

2876 2018-08-05 17:14:53 Adrian, why are you so surprised that you haven’t seen @andygoss58 at the game ? He’s an armchair supporter just like all a lot of city fans - glory hunters. Gossy only started getting behind them since 2008 (When oil money came)

2880 2018-08-05 17:14:20 So long as its understood fracking for oil is not a long term solution. The depletion rates fall off a cliff after peaking.

2886 2018-08-05 17:13:23 Try coconut oil,  it's actually like crisco, not runny oily
But Crisco makes it, some other brands are more expensive. 
Don't see a difference.

2893 2018-08-05 17:12:58 Smt it was too much oil, paint n vibes to catch the whole ting. Niggaz destroy it and somehow was running through with a casket
2894 2018-08-05 17:12:56 Just looking at how much butter and oil they use will give anyone a heart attack too lol.
2895 2018-08-05 17:12:52 Someone attempted to murder the leader of Venezuela using a bomb drone. Pretty sure we know who did it, as Venezuela has enormous amounts of shale oil.

2901 2018-08-05 17:12:01 Yes, the main reason is that Maduro controls the flow of dollars earned by oil industry. Besides, because of the expropiations performed by tyranny, there are no industries, and the country need to import consumer goods with foreign exchange.

2905 2018-08-05 17:11:39 Anybody else noticed that all icecreams contain coconut oil? Son the chef says it’s a replacement for palm oil & necessary for smoothness. I’m allergic to coconut so I’ve been looking at all the different types in the freezer sections Last week 1/2

2911 2018-08-05 17:11:10 I didn't say Bush didn't have permission to invade Iraq to gain possession of their oil assets, which is the Bush family business, but think it criminal how Repoopicans spend money that puts citizens in a recession Democrats dig us out of. But you don't care.
2912 2018-08-05 17:11:07 Wrong. As a Venezuelan, I can certainly speak to the oppression and despair this socialist regime has brought to the country, millions of people are in fact starving. Venezuela does have the largest oil reserves but it’s extremely mismanaged. The US isn’t doing enough IMO.
2913 2018-08-05 17:11:06 When City win the league, since Fergie’s retirement, Chelsea or City will have won 5 out of 6 titles.

2926 2018-08-05 17:09:57 The Liberal Party says they support Health Care - but - Paul Martin made the largest cuts to Health Care funding ever. That money has never been replaced. The Liberal Party says they support the Environment - but - they are buying a pipeline and are encouraging more Tar Sands oil
2927 2018-08-05 17:09:51 I would say also add the conflict will happen as China goes global in order to secure oil supply. The U.S on the other hand no longer needs to be involved in underwriting the global oil supply chain as we will be drowning in shale and LNG.

2935 2018-08-05 17:09:15 What happens if you put it in a bottle of olive oil and then put the olive oil on pizza?
2936 2018-08-05 17:09:10 It’s not the volatility that’s the problem, it’s the kind of oil that Venezuela. Theyvahve the crudest form which cannot be sold without a high level of refinement & Chavez, when he kicked out Exxon et al, did not invest in the refineries that were critical for exporting
2937 2018-08-05 17:09:08 Petroleum ? Think by now their refinaries are closed due to huge fall in crude oil production.
2938 2018-08-05 17:08:52 It's a well oiled machine. All we need to do is stop providing the oil.
Adios.
2939 2018-08-05 17:08:43 1) You would need to show economic projection of economic revenues v public spending, not just oil which is in decline and a volatile resource. Thousand sacked since 2015. Large companies like Chevron want out, difficulty is finding new ones who could pay £30bndecom liabilities.
2940 2018-08-05 17:08:35 After Nixon took us off the gold standard in about 1970, inflation became rampant. Apparently the dollar became tied to the price of oil & no longer to the price of gold, which had kept it steady. This is so harmful to every person in this country. See the shocking chart online.
2941 2018-08-05 17:08:25 @thebodycoach peanut butter brownies 100g oats, 75g choc whey protein, 75g dried blueberries, 250g dates, 50g melted coconut oil, 1 tbs cocoa, 25g walnuts, 25g almonds wizzed up in a blender.

3012 2018-08-05 16:59:54 Why the U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela? According to MSM : "Nicholas Maduro is a DICTATOR who starving & killing his own people". LMAO! The truth is, Venezuela has the LARGEST oil reserves in the world, and that's why the U.S wanted to overthrow their leader so badly.
3013 2018-08-05 16:59:51 LNutra is just another dime-a-dozen unproven diet gimmick. $300 for a shoebox sized collection of kale chips & freeze dried soup, that's promoted as a magic cure all for longevity, weight loss, cancer tmt, etc. Slick marketing of snake oil, not @US_FDA approved for any condition.

3017 2018-08-05 16:59:30 Ham, Spring onion, white wine, 40% cream, Emmentaler, Gouda and Parmesan. Pepper, Garlic powder and Cheese filled tortellini. Use very little oil to brown the ham, extuingish with white wine, reduce for a bit then add cream. Season - then cheese - then Tortellini and spring onion

3022 2018-08-05 16:58:47 What would happen to the prices of stocks, housing, gold, oil, etc., if currencies ever became asset backed (gold & oil)?
3023 2018-08-05 16:58:46 @WWF @SierraClub Has anyone ever tested the toxicity (or lack thereof) of linseed oil dissolving styrofoam?
3024 2018-08-05 16:58:43 China evacuated it's workers from the oil fields in Ogaden. Jigjiga is relatively calm. EPRDF media is on a non-stop propoganda calling for military action and economic sanction on the state.

3027 2018-08-05 16:58:29 The house smells amazing.  Olive oil in pan, chopped onion. Cleared a spot and toasted dried Italian seasoning, oregano & smoked paprika, then added chopped garlic. Added can of stewed tomatoes, salt, pepper and sugar.  It smells so good. Angel hair pasta & homemade garlic bread

3035 2018-08-05 16:57:36 This question is only possible because so many people think socialism = lots of government spending. Castro nationalised everything within a couple of years. Chavez started nationalising sporadically in 2006 before the oil price shock.

3038 2018-08-05 16:57:20 Yes, I just highlighting the different things that strip away Alberta's ability to get anywhere close to WTI pricing. The discount itself does contain the element of "we have you over a barrel." How much of Alberta oil is spot priced/bought versus longer term contracts?
3039 2018-08-05 16:57:12 Hahaha!!!I don't wash my hands neither do I rub them on my head but the oil still disappears 
3040 2018-08-05 16:57:09 This bbq sauce has no oil or sugar. What’s the point?

Greed is also why Putin's power. Oil and gas money he uses to buy politicians is money we for big cars, big houses, etc
3052 2018-08-05 16:55:36 I woke up early and got my miles in. Then sat in an oatmeal bath for about an 1.5hr. I’m bout to moisturize with shea butter + coconut oil and hold down this king size for the remainder of this here Sunday.

3065 2018-08-05 16:53:41 We can applaud Jawar's passion, cause, and persistence, however some of the means he deployed during the last leg of the #OromoProtest (cutting oil & gas transportation services) should be thoughtfully examined. As they can set precedence for the next resistance leader.

Two barrels to nil a pretty fair result...
3085 2018-08-05 16:51:14 They've been talking about selling these to third world countries without emission legislation, just to hook up population on oil addiction. Hope they fail

3133 2018-08-05 16:45:30 Hmm!! I think the effect will be the same effect it has on oil companies in Nigeria. People won't teach to make the impact they used too, politics and connection will play a major role in recuiting teachers, you know what I mean?

3138 2018-08-05 16:45:20 Yeay !

Tambah sikit lagi, kalau your sunscreen takde tulis "removeable with face wash" so first cleanser wajib guna. Kalau ada, boleh skip.

But using first cleanser (especially oil cleanser) can be very helpful in reducing the risk of getting clogged pores.

Hope it helps

3149 2018-08-05 16:44:10 I think you must be confused. The scientific consensus hasn't been overturned.
Insurance companies are refusing insurance to properties built too near the coast, not to mention new oil projects.
The general public are becoming more and more aware global warming ...

As for a Scottish Navy, given the main concerns of it will be North Sea Oil and fishery protection Rosyth makes more sense as a base.
3152 2018-08-05 16:43:48 Seems oil money is controlling media in democratic/non islamic countries, projecting Muslims as poor innocent victims, making emotional pitch for asylum, once in they ruin countries, see how's situation in EU, UK, Canada, Australia, most r on toes for fear of terrorist attacks

3165 2018-08-05 16:42:22 The best TL;DR I can come up with is Venezuela is a communism built on the high price of oil. Now the price of oil has tanked and is still low their government is broke, the currency is suffering from extreme hyperinflation, and people are literally starving to death.
3166 2018-08-05 16:42:21 I put it on while I was doing an oil change. Sped up the oil change quite a bit.

3188 2018-08-05 16:39:52 Oil companies are fleeing Alberta. Investors in our oil companies have dried up.  Gosh. Are you ill informed. Get off the kool aid .

Fallon & Co didn’t learn anything from the oil busts of the past.
3199 2018-08-05 16:37:56 So now you have ran from derivatives to a new position as expected .

3200 2018-08-05 16:37:44 Yet our oil is in the equation and their hydro is not.

3204 2018-08-05 16:37:10 Agree with you Sir.PBoC accepting the volatility in their currency. As you mentioned if euro hit 1.10,each pair will adjust accordingly. 
When Oil at $35, the growth was amazing but at $70, things are changed. Either from Italy or internally-Euro at 1.10 soon
3205 2018-08-05 16:37:09 So far today, I have slathered my hair in coconut oil in a "pre-poo" experiment. So many people swear by it, I figured I'd try it.

And got the tomato sauce in the oven. My house smells like mucho garlic. LOLOL. I kinda dig it.

3216 2018-08-05 16:35:16 Don’t worry after we use all the oil to explore asteroid mining we can still repair ecosystem with (checks notes) um... sticks and broken photovoltaics?

3218 2018-08-05 16:35:08 Snack oil...Freudian type.

3223 2018-08-05 16:34:34 You can try castor oil
3224 2018-08-05 16:34:14 Do better things like galvanizing support foe the oil exploration acceptance by the Turks. These tweets and calls for judicial immunity are founded on quick sand. Roger that.
3225 2018-08-05 16:34:10 Okay I can’t cook at all but... shaved brussel sprouts, fresh lemon juice, salt & pepper, olive oil, grated pecorino Romano, and crumbled bacon make for an EXCELLENT COMBINATION! #Food
3226 2018-08-05 16:34:00 Seizing on the Oromo factor & Abiy's blunder regarding the 5% of oil revenues he said will be allocated to the Somali region,Abdi Ilay suddenly turns a Somali hero.
3227 2018-08-05 16:33:57 Do you think England would allow the EU to take 92% of Englands oil wealth if it had any,,leaving England with 8% of its own wealth?
Do you think England would take the deal they force on scots?
3228 2018-08-05 16:33:48 Mhm!!!! I know she had the real deal! I’m going to look into it lol because I don’t have time to waste oil

Water based cleanser termasuk dalam katergori second cleanser. Ini yang wajib guna.
3232 2018-08-05 16:33:31 Follow your own advice @GovernorTomWolf. Pennsylvanians deserve a Governor who puts people first, before the profits of oil and gas.

3235 2018-08-05 16:32:55 Mr.President I wish we could get rid of Nicolos Maduro and help Venezuelains.  We could help them make good decisions about their oil productions.  Those people are straving.  They did not know the TRUE meaning of Socialism.  They cannot escape.  They need us-we could use them.
3236 2018-08-05 16:32:50 Oil is thicker than blood
3237 2018-08-05 16:32:44 I have two questions for you Liam
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil and gas revenues or the 8% we get from westminster?
2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run thier own country?
I look forward to your honest replies Liam

3246 2018-08-05 16:31:38 Notley was dealt a bad hand but she made it worse implementing a carbon tax and creating that insane "fair share committee" made up of anti oil lobbyists in her first year,  both of which have backfired on her.

3248 2018-08-05 16:31:25 Hello girls sorry for interrupting !

Oil based cleanser = eg Hada Labo Cleansing Oil, Biore Cleansing Oil

Cleansing water = micellar water eg. Garnier Micellar Water, Bifesta Cleansing Lotion

Water based cleanser = cleanser biasa eg. Simple Gel Wash, Cetaphil Cleanser
3249 2018-08-05 16:31:14 @ReallySwara Crude oil touched 40$ per barrel yet you didn’t reduce the price of retail petrol and diesel indirectly fuelling inflation. Still no clarity on bringing Petroleum products under GST.

3254 2018-08-05 16:30:33 Agreed Jason. Sad to see banks like HSBC fall prey to an argument that goes contrary to economic well being of vast majority Canadians. All Canadian  companies should follow Suncor example.  Why not just leave Canada HSBC  . Oil sands provide hundreds of jobs to Canadians

After indy westminster will get 0% and scots will have 100%.
Scotland has subsidised England for decades,,thats why they wont let scots go

3268 2018-08-05 16:29:07 You do enjoy throwing the BS around. Care to state IN SPECIFIC FACTS any FACTUAL BASIS for using the term traitor? FACTS,not hyperbole.Can you? It's odd for a traitor to do to Russia what Trump did in Syria, Ukraine, & exporting of US Gas/Oil. Fit that into your narrative for me.
3269 2018-08-05 16:29:02 The only issue for me was that when the shell used to crack due to heat and the oil used to splash on skin...
3270 2018-08-05 16:28:45 Like westminster ignored scots EU vote?
Do you really think EU does`nt want access to Europes largest oil and gas fields,,those ones westminster told the scots were finished and worthless?
Barnet!,,in barnet WM takes 92% of scots oil revenues,,did you even know that Liam?
3271 2018-08-05 16:28:43 Have you tried coconut oil instead of typical degreasers? Also, I know you don’t have it but those silicone cooking mats were the BEST investment.

3299 2018-08-05 16:25:28 And we are still speaking English right. George Bush got embarrassed in Desert Storm and his son started a war over nothing but wanting oil. But the Military isn't a terrorist organization and what happened to Isis after so long that's right it was made up

3301 2018-08-05 16:25:17 Sometimes fellow patients are the most judgmental, but of course the assumption of me “not taking my health in my own hands” comes from my lack of interest in their snack oil product sales.

3305 2018-08-05 16:25:03 Great. Most of the power that would have been supplied by this modern natural gas fired power plant will now be produced by far dirtier coal and diesel oil fired plants. A win for the environment!!!

3318 2018-08-05 16:24:02 But your owners manual won't say to change your oil any more often than a British car's owners manual would... it's just that Britan doesn't have those kinds of convenient drive-in-and-wait oil change places (that I know of, anyway).

3321 2018-08-05 16:23:51 Starts off strong and then: we have to blame socialism too.
Those "socialist" countries are capitalist and the USSR existed in a capitalist world system. Thus the all the oil selling.
Then this: get out the vote - for "socialists" who are essentially FDR Dems
3322 2018-08-05 16:23:32 Williams, Oga Umar obviously has no answer to your question. Ignore him.
3323 2018-08-05 16:23:29 That amount is going up as new tariffs add $2500 to the price of a car and new executive orders have raised the price of health insurance too. Wait, take Iranian oil off the market again and gas prices go up too.

3331 2018-08-05 16:22:54 There are places that recommend changing oil way more than what your owners manual will say, but that's just to drum up business for them. These are places where you can drive in and sit in your car while they change your oil, then drive it away again.

3337 2018-08-05 16:21:54 Ah, New Jersey. I can smell the oil fumes from here.
3338 2018-08-05 16:21:50 As they pumped more oil, they in turn drove oil prices down, so had to pump more.
But, note that countries like Norway also heavily depend on oil prices, yet nothing happened to them. Venezuela is what happens when you nationalize industry and use it to pay for social programs.

3341 2018-08-05 16:21:32 Just saw something interesting in western KS - an oil derrick with a solar panel beside it, with windmills in the background. We need it all!
3342 2018-08-05 16:21:30 There was an oil crisis in 1973/74 which plunged many countries in crisis if you are old enough to remember. Before you analyse a graph... there are more macro-environmental factors outside nations and the EU influence which play a factor and influence an economy.

3353 2018-08-03 23:59:08 It’s like any other form of lobbying, you pay money for a return. Such as oil companies lobbying for lax environmental laws so they don’t get fined as much if they have a massive spill, or pharmaceutical companies pushing drugs through that haven’t been tested

3388 2018-08-03 23:55:54 Not to mention, it’s natural to your body. It feels like you been feeding your car vegetable oil and now it’s finally running on premium gasoline. You’re a herbivore, any temptation is purely addiction. Just like a smoker craving a bogie. Embrace your true nature.

3410 2018-08-03 23:51:34 That "name" argument has been around at least as far back as 1980 when I traded my very first bbls of oil between Mobil and Langham Petroleum (my employer). We gave Mobil 1,121 bbls of WTS at Ryan Junction, TX + $2.00/bbl for equal volume of LLS @ St James on 8/8/80.  #OOTT

3420 2018-08-03 23:50:41 Double cup me bitch I’m sipping on oil
3421 2018-08-03 23:50:37 So, update on Jetta. While it's about time I did a coolant flush, it appears she was just low on coolant. Topped her off and no overheating issues so far. Yay =3

Got a list of things to do now, coolant flush, oil change and plugs. Thankfully, I can do all those myself!
3422 2018-08-03 23:50:04 And only to add to that, we are giving up a massive advantage most countries could only dream of, the cheapest power generation in the world from coal. We may be the lucky country,but we are far from smart.We could be a energy superpower,we have tonnes of oil that we just ignore.

3425 2018-08-03 23:49:12 Apparently vaping is faster acting, but doesn't last as long, they say edibles/oil is better for overall, and vaping is good for break-through pain. I am an ex-tobacco smoker, so I'm afraid I'll like the feeling of vaping, and haven't tried it yet.

3430 2018-08-03 23:48:08 Actually no, again, Solar and Wind are vastly cheaper than Oil AND also RENEWABLE (kinda a big deal). Let me know if you want the source on that too.
3431 2018-08-03 23:47:50 Fresh beets, roasted in the oven, are the bomb.  Little olive oil.  Little salt n pepper
3432 2018-08-03 23:47:47 Another thing that has been helping is ingesting coconut oil, as well as using it on my face as a moisturizer twice a day. Oh, and I've been using a coconut oil sugar scrub that I made for my face. My skin has been clearer than it has been in years! Couple weeks and counting. 
3433 2018-08-03 23:47:15 Oil & Gas oil benefit sharing arrangements start from the local, state, national & on to intl (contractor).

3440 2018-08-03 23:45:36 That doesn't come close to answering my question. Look up the Azerbaijan Laundromat. That deserves encouragement? I agree the opposed regular folk of Azerbaijan deserve encouragement, but did John ever meet any of them? No, he hung around with the ambassador and visited oil pumps

3448 2018-08-03 23:44:24 Two and a half hours away from Dallas and something is wrong with my car. 

Started to make some noise and not run as well? Opened the trunk to find some like. Oil has spilled. Currently as a gas station trying to figure out the situation to get us at least to a repair shop.
3449 2018-08-03 23:44:20 ~ok so now I gotta go watch YouTube!  "Rubber it in, like you rub oil on your own ass!" Never heard of Auntie Fee before this

3455 2018-08-03 23:43:19 WWF house show at Market Square Arena Indianapolis. One of the exiting wrestlers threw the curtain back far enough for me to see heel Bret Hart putting oil on Hulk Hogan's back. I already had my suspicions, but in that moment I knew for sure.  #howigotsmartenedup

3460 2018-08-03 23:42:36 Works like a charm.  Trick is (and tell my husband this) skunk oil is like glitter - it gets everywhere it touches.  Isolate, use the above mix, and wait.
3461 2018-08-03 23:42:34 & lavender oil from amazon. Mommy should put a few drops in bath water to help get baby to sleep soon after

3463 2018-08-03 23:42:15 The old 404 was indestructible and reliable when the rubbish from BMC and Rootes were bleeding oil everywhere and exploding.
3464 2018-08-03 23:42:09 I’ve been waiting at the dealership for 3 hours to get an oil change. I could have learned how and changed my own oil at this rate.
3465 2018-08-03 23:42:00 Halloumi is the cheese that grills. It’s Greek and it’s divine brushed with olive oil. I read about it three years ago on the NYT. Trader Joe’s considers it seasonal. ‘Tis the season!
3466 2018-08-03 23:41:59 @NYeoman It's not motor oil it's Dragon Slayer imperial Stout from @MiddleAgesBeer
3467 2018-08-03 23:41:45 He laughs softly, washing the oil out....too greasy.

3469 2018-08-03 23:41:35 I need to get an oil change and car wash
3470 2018-08-03 23:41:23 I don't drink or use any kind of drugs either, but now that I have started using the oil, I wish I had started years ago, only been about 2 months for me, but is making a big difference. FYI- with the CBD/THC combo you can feel some effects if you don't start low enough!

3485 2018-08-03 23:39:32 Cutting RU from SWIFT would seriously damage them. 

Both China & RU have dreams of dollar losing prominent position, in oil as well as most other trade/financial matters. 

Neither has any capacity to bring that about. RU has no economy, and China manipulates & hides details.

3495 2018-08-03 23:38:26 That would probably make me wonder what’s in truffle oil.
3496 2018-08-03 23:38:22 lmao that’s that oil  thanks sis

3501 2018-08-03 23:37:37 Because @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is a snake oil salesman and people are gullible? 

Some naive feelings that he’s posh and sounds convincing?

Poorly educated think he’s the bees knees as looks like a cardboard cut out of an 1850’s gent and they want to be suppressed by him?

3502 2018-08-03 23:37:34 CBD oil has changed lives, you put measured amounts under your tongue, no high, no drowsiness, no bad taste, and no opioid withdrawal, that's what I won't miss! Here in Canada, Dr.'s have realised it doesn't last 12 hours though, and started prescribing every 8 hrs.

3511 2018-08-03 23:35:54 @benshapiro some real shameless advertising for that Omega 3 fish oil on your podcast today.
3512 2018-08-03 23:35:52 That's fantastic! Art is definitely an awesome "escape" from stress. I bet she'd really enjoy Sculpey. Pastels are fun, I actually prefer chalk to oil. I wonder if she'd enjoy doing the ink scratch art we used to do in school in the '70s & '80s? I still like doing those.
3513 2018-08-03 23:35:49 True.. but, maybe they should hedge oil again, isn’t it like US70 a barrel now? Is this why the crazy fuel prices are hitting us? No protection from the global increases?
3514 2018-08-03 23:35:49 So I got a ride to a buy here pay here car lot almost two hours away to buy a vehicle. Drive halfway back and the fucking things starts knocking. Oil level was fine before anyone asks. Currently waiting on a tow truck.

3524 2018-08-03 23:34:19 Another month with declining job numbers (190,000 expected) and wages stagnant or declining due to inflation. Auto emission standards  reversal will cost an additional 1 million barrels per day of oil usage/dependency/ cost to consumers. Financial pros predict a huge recession.
3525 2018-08-03 23:34:17 Why would he focus on Japan? They had no oil, the same reason Japan attacked Pearl Harbor: Fuel.

You shouldn’t write anymore. You’re not good at it.
3526 2018-08-03 23:34:15 The oil is being refined outside the country so when It returns with added duty etc, the price would skyrocket. How is that benefiting the economy or the people? Only businesses and people working there would really benefit from it.
3527 2018-08-03 23:34:07 Discutible. Sí, porque todos quieren ser franceses () pero me podría hacer la fina hablando de langue d'oïl. Y después está el quebecquois, etc. Y bueno vuelvo al 1er punto (?)
3528 2018-08-03 23:34:07 Did u miss the part where i said kwara is very big, to be honest I av no info on those areas. Now if I admit that, would you admit that he touched ilorin, patigi, lafia, malete, Tsonga etc. The current gov is a sham, and don't be fooled, he is not a puppet oo.

3532 2018-08-03 23:33:03 not by time of kobach, after gop drumbeat as background noise for 3+ decades 

not defending this (*really* not) but if all you hear is limbaugh/fox fear-mongering for 30 yrs, it alters how you hear (snake oil salesman) pitching a "solution" to problems you (don't actually) have.

3549 2018-08-03 23:29:43 Copper removes impurities, such as sulphur and bacteria, during distillation. Better than stainless steel. I know they use CO2 extraction for marijuana oil. I can't touch that. I'm a British citizen. Not sure how CO2/Copper compare for lavender.

3570 2018-08-03 23:24:48 Buck-a-beer, great.  Meanwhile, we are still paying $1.34/L for gas & the oil companies continue to announce billions of dollars in quarterly profits.
3571 2018-08-03 23:24:43 My dad just called me up to yell at me about my oil in my car that i haven’t drove since i got into my accident in March 
3572 2018-08-03 23:24:40 It’s part of your platform. You can’t be talking about solar. Everything must be powered with oil or coal. Stay on target!

3577 2018-08-03 23:23:18 @psychodwarf Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if a man is working on an oil rig in the North Sea and he dies, how are his wife and family told? Telegram? Phone call? Visit from a constable?
3578 2018-08-03 23:23:01 There is no smell more divine than oil and garlic and meat sautéing on the stove. 

The best is olive oil and garlic but peanut oil is a close second. (Making stir fry tonight.)
3579 2018-08-03 23:22:48 Also cuticle oil helps
3580 2018-08-03 23:22:47 Yup also free from GM crops no poison in our meat. Gin , Whisky , Fresh spring water , soft drinks , fish , Oil anyone believe England would be willing to give all that up ?
3581 2018-08-03 23:22:25 C'mon, this guy would cough himself unconscious vaping cannabis oil.
3582 2018-08-03 23:22:24 Wolk supported COGCC’s decision to appeal the Colorado Court of Appeals’ ruling that state law mandates protecting public health & the environment in the conduct of oil and gas operations. Sided with industry against citizens & his agency’s mission.

We can - & must - do better.
3583 2018-08-03 23:22:24 They also get their full pay for the rest of their lives... Can you imagine what this is costing the Tax Payers for every single person whose ever been in the House or Senate? This needs to be stopped! They don't deserve it! All the while, Trump is donating his entire salary.
3584 2018-08-03 23:22:23 I'm aware of oil seed radish as a cover crop, but that I did not know! Sadly I live in one of the only places where it is difficult to grow radishes.
3585 2018-08-03 23:22:13 Is that scientist being paid by big oil? Everything is about money as u say.
3586 2018-08-03 23:22:10 Yep, oil tankers.
And farm animals - it is reckoned the process of a burger pollutes more than a car ...

... well it does when I've ate one 

Road vehicles are responsible for less than 50% of pollution in London 

No one in power is damming those tankers or meat industry 
3587 2018-08-03 23:22:01 "oil rice" and pork..  
3588 2018-08-03 23:21:49 This one isn't quite so accurate. To start with, it misses the Fed's first $2 Trillion repo-swap with the ECB. and fails to recognize Gold or Oil as currencies, and doesn't include other forward arrangements.
3589 2018-08-03 23:21:47 I use their oil blends and deep blue!! Oh and on guard! Love their stuff! Haven’t tried the s/c will have to add that to the next order

3638 2018-08-03 23:13:22 I've delayed getting an oil change for DAYS black Friday deals were the star wars universe has more releases within the last

3640 2018-08-03 23:13:11 Even if I did I’m not paying to have my parents oil changed I don’t even live here
3641 2018-08-03 23:13:02 Lac Megantic isn't Burnaby, where most of city is built on or top of hills, with Burnaby Mountain on northeast. Adding 14 additional oil storage tanks on top of current 13 (1 may get taken out) exponentially increases fire danger
3642 2018-08-03 23:12:48 Agreed. Correlations come and go. This is why at some point you have to think about what it is you're actually owming - in the mid 2000s gold, oil, and SPX were all the same trade, until they weren't, but only a machine would have assumed that could go on forever.

Maybe you should ask the people on the east coast why tankers have to go there. Ethically produced oil from Canada needs be used here. #energyeast.

3711 2018-08-03 22:59:25 Wow today was just a lot for no reason. It should’ve just been a simple battery replace, oil change, and car inspection; but NOOOO

3718 2018-08-03 22:58:18 By 2050, global warming will reduce Arizona's population to 4 oil lobbyists, who get to be governor, a congressman, and two senators
3719 2018-08-03 22:58:12 Democrats !  Hear this  !
We cannot win until the RNC returns the three trillion dollars back
to the Iraqi people.  Bush/Cheney with Halliburton stole that much Iraqi oil
during the war.  We must charge and indict two Presidents for theft
of World moneys.
3720 2018-08-03 22:58:01 3/3 one thing that will be not negotiable is the royalty. It must belongs to the state where the oil is found. It helps to build schools, hospital, roads etc for the community. The share of the revenue then should be negotiated in equitable way. #Ethiopia #Ogadenia #Ddsi
3721 2018-08-03 22:57:51 An oil change is different than having someone be required to bring their car into a certified Tesla dealer that is impossible to find and has a 6 month waiting period.
3722 2018-08-03 22:57:27 what ecological debt? You progressives never stop conjuring nonsensical terms to rationalize your positions.  About 2/3 of our oil/gas is exported to the USA , they're the ones using it, let them pay the 'ecological debt'.
3723 2018-08-03 22:57:15 My favourite bit is when someone gets hit by a massive chunk of ice that they knew was going to fall but nobody dealt with until the guy nearly dies. Then I’m grateful that my most likely injury is a wee oil splash or a touch of chefs arse. Too hot in my gaff for falling ice.
3724 2018-08-03 22:57:12 @drearner yooo, remember when you got oil paint on my jacket and we spent the whole period trying to get it off

3730 2018-08-03 22:56:25 Can you speak to the national debt, Higher oil prices and higher grocery prices, higher health care premiums with less coverage? Can speak to the # of Russians you owe money to? Also WHERE ARE THE KIDS’ parents? We’ve gone from 1st to worst in presidents. #loser

3732 2018-08-03 22:55:55 The only reason the #TMX is being twinned to Burnaby and Westridge Marine Terminal is to load oil tankers for export and sail these through Metro Vancouver.

It’s not anti oil, it’s anti shipping oil around the planet when full tankers from Russia are coming the other way.
3733 2018-08-03 22:55:45 You know who also makes a profit off people thinking climate change is a hoax? Big oil, why haven't u ever flipped the script if your thinking people are only doing things for money and ask the other side of the question?

3739 2018-08-03 22:54:52 Don't forget the moron north of you guys who thought it would be a great idea to use tax payer dollars to buy a dying oil pipeline that's destroying wildlife habitats, bulldozing through native land & polluting waterways
3740 2018-08-03 22:54:43 With the rate at which sardine is reducing inside the tin, I won't be shocked if I open the next tin and just see oil & a note with the words "Sardine was here" inside 
3741 2018-08-03 22:54:35 Canada could stop producing oil, stop driving, stop breathing and it would make NO meaningful diff to world climate, NONE.  We export 3 million Barrels/day of oil to USA, $150M/day ... only a fool would imperil a key export while the USA uses that energy scot free.
3742 2018-08-03 22:54:29 Russian economy is now vaccinated against western sanctions,moreover with oil price above 70$ ,Putin can do whatever he wants
3743 2018-08-03 22:53:59 The fact that you think climate and weather are the same thing shows how ignorant you are about the subject. Also, every single major oil company has admitted to contributing to anthropogenic climate change. Every one. That's on top of the mountains of scientific evidence.
3744 2018-08-03 22:53:47 She loves the feel of play dough so clay is something i have considered, right now shes started combining oil pastels and paint and also colored pencils, she loves all art thats why we started this was to give her the option to do whatever she wants and to keep her interested

3748 2018-08-03 22:52:50 .@marcorubio @realDonaldTrump Maduro just ordered the dean of the 2nd largest university to stay in the country and confiscated her passport, ONLY for political reasons. Why are we buying oil?
3749 2018-08-03 22:52:42 There was an oil spill  I was wondering why there was so much traffic passing by my job

3751 2018-08-03 22:51:53 Just incredible, but now they are holding parents with children in privately run prisons, and I think you must address this situation also. This is equally unacceptable! #impeachTrump We can't take any more of this loser, snake oil salesman!
3752 2018-08-03 22:51:25 @RealAlexJones You completely suck.  You are worse than any snake oil salesman of old. You should literally apologise to any and all people who have ever considered your videos and casts are even remotely true.

I'm not religious but you should be scared.

3755 2018-08-03 22:50:31 I live in St George, UT and I am voting for for Shirleen.  You are nothing but a Trump puppet with lips stuck on Nunes' ass-hole while you sell away Southern Utah's national parks to oil companies.  You are horrible for Southern Utah.  We see you, and will vote you out.
3756 2018-08-03 22:50:25 Where’s the science behind shipping oil to Asia? Considering Parklands Refinery in Burnaby produces 9X’s more emissions than Cherry Creek across the border which processes 2X’s as much, what do you think emission levels are in smoggy China?  #cdnpoli #vanpoli #bcpoli
3757 2018-08-03 22:50:22 ...Merkel to stop paying $400B/yr to Russia for gas & oil but instead buy from USA, 8. He signed record sanctions against Russian companies & diplomats, 9. NATO Pres says Trump forced NATO nations to pay $44B more in '17 than they did in '16.
3758 2018-08-03 22:49:43 All of the costs to fight fires & floods should go directly to big oil. And a gas tax at the pump. Not to individual home owners and persons reducing their carbon footprint
3759 2018-08-03 22:49:33 Everything I read about RSPO says that the organization is corrupt and useless. Hiding behind that to make money is disgusting. Use a vegetable oil that isn't destroying the planet if you cared about anything other than $$$$$ @NutellaGlobal @Moneyish
3760 2018-08-03 22:49:23 - If you can’t find castor oil anywhere near you, don’t worry cause you can always use olive oil or coconut oil, since they will have the same effect on your brows

3766 2018-08-03 22:48:05 The lack of response to this is remarkable. Chemicals regulations impact pretty much everything, from food to pharma to household products to motoring (how do you think your oil and brake fluids are regulated?).
3767 2018-08-03 22:46:54 The White House administration is appalling & so is how they treat others. This ‘Fake news’ distraction is like watching kids trying to obfuscate & bully others when they are faced with the truth. The press doesn’t deserve the revolting treatment they get from snake oil sellers
3768 2018-08-03 22:46:39 - “Castor oil” is the best thing on this planet if you want super thick brows,
It will literally transform your brows, super effective and quick, also it is natural so you don’t have to worry about any chemicals etc. 
- Massage it really well into your brows 
3769 2018-08-03 22:46:32 #Ethiopia’s PM comment on oil revenue sharing is off-track.

These formulas promote inequality that breads instability, see Nigeria’s Delta region. 1/1 cont.

3785 2018-08-03 22:45:15 @andersoncooper - Missed your FB chat on "A toxic algae bloom" Do you think the oil spills, cleanups that supposedly came along with them, the back to back storms as well as higher CO2 levels are the "perfect storm" for the red tide?

3788 2018-08-03 22:44:46 Majority of Iranian support the leadership. 

Why would Iran trust a two faced nation like the US that once overthrew a democratically elected Iranian Government to install a Western Puppet called the Shah? 

USA has no interest in Iranian people, only Iranian Oil & Gas
3789 2018-08-03 22:44:36 @garyvee you'll never see this tweet but if you do... can you (would you) talk about how important it is to understand the snake oil in an industry and how to use it to prove your authenticity. Authenticity & empathy builds pyramids, not buildings, right?

3805 2018-08-03 22:41:18 There's a lot of things I dislike about my car but the engine isn't one of them. So much pulling power for only being a 1.6 litre engine, drop it into 4th or 3rd and it will accelerate hard with no complaints. Surprising given how the oil change was several thousand miles overdue
3806 2018-08-03 22:40:53 They would certainly not mind gradually selling hydrogen in one country and petrol in another.  Big Oil are definitely not benefactors.  They simply think about their business model in 22 years.

We could help them by sending in rigs to dig up all their oil & we would not only make Mexico rich we would also benefit.  This would help make Mexico rich & help their people.

3824 2018-08-03 22:37:41 It's the end of Never Cry Wolf.  He was studying the wolves, learned that they were not killing the caribou it was the oil companies, poachers kill the wolves.  This is him musing on how "seeing them with the eyes of a man" had opened the ways for the horrors that followed.

3827 2018-08-03 22:37:30 A logical explanation should include: (1) actual price per barrel 06/2015-12/2016 compared to the 'average strike price' of options bought; (2) the current admin's plan for the use/*removal of the SCT levied for the hedge; (3) plans to deal with increasing oil prices.
3828 2018-08-03 22:37:26 @JoyVBehar Follow the $ irt DJT. He dissed Germany, a democracy, for buying Russian oil. He scales back Obama Admin regulations on emmissions, opens up Nat'l Parks to research & drilling for oil. He pushes oil & coal & restricts renewables. Does that tell you what his goals are?
3829 2018-08-03 22:37:11 And thank you to @azemezi who has managed to settle my brain about this book business. Now I have to find a place to move Chiwetel, Bruno Mars and rose hip oil on my acknowledgments page. Totally worth the upheaval.
3830 2018-08-03 22:37:10 Oddly most of the same people also bought the other big #lie that natural resources such as fish stocks, wildlife, old growth forests, oil and coal are limitless.

3831 2018-08-03 22:36:29 Filled up my tank, oil change and 4 new tires... BITCH IM BROKE LMAO BYE
3832 2018-08-03 22:36:28 By taking millions just like the politicians who take money from the big oil companies that don't speak out yet always say thoughts and prayers to be loyalist to the nra because that's what they are paid to do.
3833 2018-08-03 22:36:17 Just imagine that after a guy that had kissed now saw that clip... Honestly if it happens to be me I will waste a tube of toothpaste at a go and drink anointing oil join. And disconnect totally from her.

3837 2018-08-03 22:35:41 Because along with coal mining, oil drilling, and farming, those are the jobs that Real Americans (TM) do.
3838 2018-08-03 22:35:28 Literally been waiting in a lobby since 5:00 for a oil change I wanna put my meat on these guyshays heads
3839 2018-08-03 22:35:26 Lack of oil locked it up. 
3840 2018-08-03 22:35:19 You have to wonder why all these leave voters in England are too afraid to call their own independence referendum i would 100% back them. Must to be afraid to lose the oil and tax and revenue from Scotland as brexit will fuck them and their gonna need money from somewhere

3844 2018-08-03 22:34:36 Lots of dirty oil money in Texas. Plus Ted would f*ck a snake if you held its head!  My pop had the best lines

3846 2018-08-03 22:34:06 Wow I actually did this some days ago, mixed some coconut oil with the batter and it was pretty good
3847 2018-08-03 22:34:04 JLP Govt: *collects extra tax  meant as insurance premium against oil increase ... and then spends it on something else*

Jamaica: Uhm, why is the extra tax we pay not being used to cushion against oil price increases?

JLP Govt: Is the PNP! 


3848 2018-08-03 22:33:53 Thanks I can't find where it explains the times when oil prices drop yet the ppl at the #fuelpump goes up or remains the same, & and how the 2.2% retailer profit compares to yours. I love #profit & #growth, but really love #tranparency. @BP_plc @Shell @woolworths can you explain?

3853 2018-08-03 22:33:19 We were also able to escape recession statistically due to the recent oil boom not because the  people in his cabinet make use of their initiatives. Our economic policy under @mbuhari is the 'Do nothing approach'

Canada is a competitor, they people to protest in Canada, especially pipelines. They want our social programs over capacity.

I rest my case.

3979 2018-08-03 22:14:41 How much would the government receive from oil and gas leases?  Does the state benefit?  How large an area are we speaking of?  How many wells?

3986 2018-08-03 22:13:16 castor oil is great & natural!
3987 2018-08-03 22:13:11 I'd be more worried about oil/fat splashes on bare skin than looks when cooking!
3988 2018-08-03 22:13:01 And he’ll allow oil drilling off our coastline!!!!  Why aren’t you all hammering this home????
3989 2018-08-03 22:12:49 Sensors to detect soil moisture levels in agriculture, vibration in manufacturing machinery, temperature in food transport, velocity of soccer balls, location of pallets, heat of oil drilling bits. Remove the internet, and you have #EdgeProcessing

3991 2018-08-03 22:12:39 My understanding is that when the JLP assumed power, the hedge was already paid for ... and the hedge tax already being collected.
Once the hedge expired, the JLP opted not to renew the hedge, hoping that the oil price would not pass $60/$65 ... but they left the tax in place.

3994 2018-08-03 22:12:17 i forgot how tiring oil painting can be ...
3995 2018-08-03 22:12:11 So they still sold oil then?
3996 2018-08-03 22:11:46 Fun fact: the term snake oil isn't because snake oil is a scam. 

About century ago, snake oil salesman sold cheap, adulterated oil claiming it was snake oil. There's reason to think snake oil, rich in omega-3, may have had benefits. The problem was the salesman.
3997 2018-08-03 22:11:44 That’s oil made from non-viable seeds, which is not subject to regulation

4003 2018-08-03 22:10:37 Why is it when I get my oil changed, I never believe the techs who say I need this or that as well...I just feel like they are suddenly used car salesmen pushing the "extended warranty".
4004 2018-08-03 22:10:34 Hate when I lose my lip balm & I’m at someone’s house & have to result in applying olive oil on em.
4005 2018-08-03 22:10:31 Lets speakout against this evil and the British govt ongoing GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra in Nigeria to steal oil and gas. All evils are WICKEDNESS before the MOST HIGH.
4006 2018-08-03 22:10:27 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
4007 2018-08-03 22:10:26 I have personally seen a woman get hired on as a technician with no experience. As a matter of fact, it was my brothers girlfriend. All you need is one person to accept you in as an oil changer and then work your way up.
4008 2018-08-03 22:10:26 Imagine the money would have to spend on the Liberal Government projects (read:mis-spending) if we weren’t buying foreign oil and collecting the tax on our own product. SMH!!!!

4015 2018-08-03 22:09:42 And that's in a large city. I just read about a job fair in West Texas. Oil services can find no CDLs. Imagine what the prestige ratio must have been in 1966 (4% growth in gold dolrs). I imagine back then college was if you liked to read books. Not that you were a better person.
4016 2018-08-03 22:09:30 Perhaps without oil, education & development would have been the focus.
4017 2018-08-03 22:09:29 this man at the hair store put this oil in my hair & it’s killing me , it smells like tea tree oil & i hate it 
4018 2018-08-03 22:09:29 While all this is great. What about the current clean up of the waters. Why aren’t we cleaning the water as if it’s an oil spill.

4029 2018-08-03 22:07:30 When I was young, hmm.  As far as I remember all States didn't allow you to  pump your own gasoline.  In fact I was one of those guys who did the pumping, washed the windows and checked the oil and tires, free as a service.  That was the 40's and 50's. Has it changed?

But the last two nights I put coconut oil on my healing cold sore and it’s almost gone. Much faster then when i use my typical medicine 

Just saying.

2. Whenever socialism is bought up there's always someone with the ”Venezuela” which is a strawman argument.  What happened in ”Venezuela” was oil prices dropped and inflation.

4038 2018-08-03 22:06:34 Good luck with that.  A land locked country with wheat, oil, and timber, who will have to negotiate away all their sovereignty just to gain access to global markets.

Not positive the oil change(45$) was done Bc I don’t have a sticker.

4053 2018-08-03 22:03:44 Well to be perfectly honest, in my humble opinion, of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view, but also by looking into this matter in a different perspective and without being condemning of one's view's and by trying to make it objective...

4069 2018-08-03 22:01:56 Glad that’s still happening in Shetland - share surplus evening catch with neighbours. Nothing like fresh-from-sea fish. I guess tradition is from days before freezers, but also attitude is there’s more where that came from, a summer bounty. Best grilled, have their own oil.
4070 2018-08-03 22:01:56 The truth is we have so much so much in Benin we have palm oil that made Malaysia part of what it is today

Admin's retrograde step is a gift to:
- OEM's who don't want to invest in newer, cleaner tech,
- Al and Mg smelters who supply engine block, transmission and axle cases,
- Big Oil.

This will goose short term profit with long term competitive and environmental consequences.

4098 2018-08-03 21:59:04 Is it weird to just bring the office olive oil ?? Do I need separate bottles or can it be like a serve yourself thing ...
4099 2018-08-03 21:59:03 Because it’s tempura it will tend to be on the oily/buttery side flavor wise. Try something with acidity to brighten up the dish. Citrus or vinegar based. Maybe lime, cilantro, shallots, olive oil salt and pepper to taste.

4117 2018-08-03 21:56:39 Laughable how the gospel of money "preachers" & other snake oil salesmen think they can define "elites" & it will be so.
4118 2018-08-03 21:56:21 My mother raised us as if we came from Oil Barons. 

In reality we were only small business owners.
4119 2018-08-03 21:56:21 Listen! I'm in TX and 2/3 poly girls have a square headed, exmilitary, oil industry husband talking about "he knows and WONT be involved"
4120 2018-08-03 21:56:18 You too have a great weekend guys!
4121 2018-08-03 21:56:16 13 To Go: CAUTION

The no.30 has blown up. “I can see the streak of oil on the track,” Will reports. He continues to lead the race.

This should set up a restart with 10 to go.  #GORV100 [PR]
4122 2018-08-03 21:56:11 Maybe something with infused olive oil ..
4123 2018-08-03 21:55:53 All that and palm oil, popular ingredient in many of those snake food have caused deforestation, loss of habitat, murdered native peoples but fat fucking ignij
4124 2018-08-03 21:55:49 Yep, what do those so called experts know...says Jacob the snake oil salesman.
4125 2018-08-03 21:55:45 OMG! Just when you think you've seen it all, this con-artist, snake oil pusher brings another  degradation to his carnival act presidency! We always knew some people will do ANYTHING forjust like tRump! @tedlieu @AlexanderChow @LOLGOP @AcornPark @KateMiller57 @rtmcclure @ijefff
4126 2018-08-03 21:55:43 Always utopia somewhere else
4127 2018-08-03 21:55:36 Oil of Olay!
4128 2018-08-03 21:55:26 Lots of small ones that can take awhile & how many mothers & fathers for patients grow therapy hobby? I wouldn't mind better oil than stock market blended & green shakes for breakfast on the cheap for my #EndocannabinoidSystem #GrowYourOwnTherapy
4129 2018-08-03 21:55:19 THAT LAST ONE KILLS ME EVERY SINGLE TIME (but generally like.... normal people say hey I like u and these two NERDS say shit like Ronan was like a heart attack or his feelings for Adam were an oil spill in the ocean THEY HAVE N O C H I L )
4130 2018-08-03 21:55:09 Iran's Saviz "cargo" ship orchestrated Red Sea attack on two Saudi oil tankers. The attack on two Saudi supertankers on the Red Sea on Wednesday, July 25, was orchestrated by the Iranian Saviz, a weapons-carrying spy ship, DEBKAfile's intelligence sources report.
4131 2018-08-03 21:55:05 Snake oil salesman ^^^
4132 2018-08-03 21:54:46 well now you just saved $4 on your next oil change. (Lower right corner)
4133 2018-08-03 21:54:41 Oil jars 100/500ml
4134 2018-08-03 21:54:31 EFF and MDC are complete opposites. Let me simply it its like day and night or water and oil!
4135 2018-08-03 21:54:24 อย่าว่าแต่ตี 4 นี่ตี 5 ละเด้อ
4136 2018-08-03 21:54:21 When I'm with a particularly nasty ho, I prefer to go old school and use a plastic shopping bag and some motor oil.
4137 2018-08-03 21:54:20 Maybe I misunderstand the whole thing - but the taxes and hedge no 2 different thing? The taxes were added ages ago to go towards the debt consolidation fund, the hedge was the insurance we paid/ pay if oil price went above US65 a barrel? Problem is -under PNP oil was like at 1/2
4138 2018-08-03 21:54:17 Thinking about trying this CBD oil 
4139 2018-08-03 21:53:56 SURPRISE! Late Night Stream tonight! Come and burn the midnight oil with me!. LIVE at 12:30 A.M. EST.

4142 2018-08-03 21:53:29 Shame we butchered all those whales for lighting oil...
4143 2018-08-03 21:53:20 Veamos cómo vamos:

4144 2018-08-03 21:53:19 Mario is feeling the heat, hence the sponsorship. Big Sugar, Big Oil and the Kochs are not enough to keep him in office, so he'll throw a bone to liberals as the Blue Tsunami gains strength.
4145 2018-08-03 21:53:17 저거 캠파 하는거임??
4146 2018-08-03 21:52:28 Is the smell that puts me off!! I got the James Read gradual tan oil, it’s really good but have to be careful applying it!  You should try it.. 
4147 2018-08-03 21:52:24 Cleansing oil changed my life.
4148 2018-08-03 21:52:10 Fellas here’s some free game, shower daily and invest in a good cologne/fragrance oil. Ladies will appreciate it. No woman wants to smell backwoods and “outside” on ya lol

4152 2018-08-03 21:51:06 Bought some CBD oil praying it cures this anxiety 
4153 2018-08-03 21:50:31 Hate when eyebrows look like oil slicks
4154 2018-08-03 21:50:22 @realDonaldTrump has agreed to this. I guarantee it. Want to know what they talked about in the closed door meeting? Where Putin was going to start moving troops. Georgia has VAST oil and gas reserves waiting to be harvested. This is part of the payoff. Our POTUS is compromised.

4157 2018-08-03 21:50:12 Crude Oil Prices Swing on Supply Concerns; July Support Remains
4158 2018-08-03 21:50:03 How many wine barrels do you have in your cellar? How much plant material to make a patient a green shake or way better oil than stock market cooking oil blended? Heck if I'll buy my pain relief like corn in a can after my Chocolate Factory experience. #GrowYourOwnTherapy
4159 2018-08-03 21:49:44 It’s laughable, not to mention the zombie like state of mind they are in. Just saying.
4160 2018-08-03 21:49:42 @SethRudetsky I have some games for you!!
-snake oil
-bring your own book
4161 2018-08-03 21:49:41 @JohannaKonta From 5-2 to 6-7 ffs, you are queen of unforced error.
4162 2018-08-03 21:49:32 Who is that hiding behind farmers? The oil and gas industry, trying to bankrupt local governments that  protect the health and safety of their residents.
4163 2018-08-03 21:49:21 Linseed oil courses through your veins eh @valmcdermid
4164 2018-08-03 21:49:16 半botです。中の人の正体は…ふふっ、
4165 2018-08-03 21:49:09 You asked me what I thought, I told you  oil spill happened because of consumers demand for oil/fuel. Livestock animal suffering (drought, slaughter or otherwise) happens because of consumers demand for meat and dairy
4166 2018-08-03 21:49:09 Brush both sides with some olive oil with a pinch of salt out right on grill depending on how thick of a piece 5 to 8 minutes each side YUM!
4167 2018-08-03 21:48:45 Oil perfs are the best
4168 2018-08-03 21:48:40 my parents bought this air fryer that cooks without oil aaaand it’s good as fuck. i’m gonna be a healthy queen now.
4169 2018-08-03 21:48:26 And then Al Gore became a snake oil salesman, making a fortune out of a lie.
4170 2018-08-03 21:48:15 I need to learn how to change my own damn oil
4171 2018-08-03 21:48:11 Stop shipping oil by way of the oceans
4172 2018-08-03 21:48:03 -oil pulling does not only whiten teeth but it has other benefits as well 
apple cider vinegar 
•mix one teaspoon of acv with a cup of water, then swish around in your mouth.
hydrogen peroxide (hp)
2 tsp of hp with 1 tsp of baking soda and gently brush your teeth with it
4173 2018-08-03 21:47:59 Leftist idiot: IT'S ALL THOSE EBUL OIL COMPANIES' FAULT!

Me, an intellectual: who bought all that oil?
4174 2018-08-03 21:47:45 Got the gym out the way, finally got the time to change my own oil, now im finna cruise with the homies to Virginia beach. ayyyyy
4175 2018-08-03 21:47:09 Comrade it’s because if you were really an American you know that your teeny little tax cut was absorbed by the cost of oil increase alone let alone all the other costs that have increased because of the oil increase but thanks for playing #Comrade #troll
4176 2018-08-03 21:46:46 St John was singlehandedly responsible for steering Saudi oil away from BP to Standard Oil.

4178 2018-08-03 21:46:40 Dean laughed at Tommy. Mainly the cooking oil. Partially because when you're drunk a lot if things are funny.  "Well then prove yourself." He took off what was left and stroked himself waiting for the other man to step up and deliver what was promised.

4183 2018-08-03 21:45:41 It was an oil company actually. Some years back. Petrochina.
4184 2018-08-03 21:45:38 Coconut oil definitely clogs the pores. 
4185 2018-08-03 21:45:35 Been sitting in this same spot for 3 1/2 hrs waiting for a fucking oil/transmission fluid change and still no update. But my anxiety keeps from asking

4187 2018-08-03 21:45:22 " Gladly~ "

Homura covered her body in oil so their nudr bodys can rub all over.
4188 2018-08-03 21:45:19 tea tree oil after every shower
4189 2018-08-03 21:45:19 I use peppermint easily more often and in greater quantities than any other oil. Have to buy 2 bottles every month. I use it to keep breathing easy (along with lemon and eucalyptus). But it is also great rubbed on my neck and scalp to cool down after cooking.
4190 2018-08-03 21:45:18 Fire is my most hated. I’m at level 704. Have been playing for a good, long while, but the fire still makes me cringe. Something about them makes me try to go faster instead of slowing down to plan my next move. Agree that oil slick is a close second.
4191 2018-08-03 21:45:17 Should be a great night of racing at Corrigan Oil Speedway. Cars have just been called to the chute for qualifications.
4192 2018-08-03 21:45:16 هو مش علاجي جدا، بمعني إن الهالات مش بتختفي، بس الrosehip seed oil بيحسن شكل منطقة العين و بدل ما تبقي مرهقة شكلها بيبقي جميل و مترطبة كويس، الزيت ده عامة جميل جدا للبشرة، بيخليها مترطبة كويس و مش شاحبة، بس طبعا إلا البشرة الدهنية مينفعش معاها زيوت عشان بتسبب حبوب تحت الجلد
4193 2018-08-03 21:45:02 My grandma is usually offered a crate of regular people olive oil for one bottle of her stuff, so you better believe this thing is real.
4194 2018-08-03 21:44:57 Need an oil change
4195 2018-08-03 21:44:49 He preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: He anointest my head with oil, Psalm 23:5.
4196 2018-08-03 21:44:47 Gas prices are more in Indiana than here in WI and I believe they refine oil in INDIANA. Fed Fuel tax, State fuel tax, local tax, then if you’re trucking you got more Taxes levied from certain states. Yet no transportation money to fix roads.
4197 2018-08-03 21:44:45 I got rid of mice in my house using peppermint oil. It took time and persistance, but worked. They don't like the smell, so put some drops on cotton balls near all her entrances and change them every day or two till she decides to leave.
4198 2018-08-03 21:44:44 Her dad said he’d get her oil changed as long as she’s in college.... well big f**** Help

When asked about maintenance on the pipe, they have “routine maintenance” blah blah blah. Which probably means they hven’t looked lately.

4204 2018-08-03 21:43:51 read the whole thing. Anti-science is real and a genuine threat to health. Beautiful faces have always sold stuff, or been used to mold opinion. Be aware of the modern quacks and snake oil merchants
4205 2018-08-03 21:43:30 I can’t believe this whole thing started over an Angels practice. One of my best times ever we did a short Det to Pcola and they were off that week so I got to sit on an oil drum every afternoon and watch them practice
4206 2018-08-03 21:43:29 Wacky Workbench probably... mostly because it fleshes out all level design problems on Sonic CD. 

Aside from that I'd say Marble Garden or Oil Ocean, because they don't do much and drag for too long for their respective games.

4208 2018-08-03 21:43:05 When are you going to enact policies that actually CREATE wealth, instead of just redistributing it? If it were not for a USA economy on fire & solid OIL prices, this country would be in recession.

4214 2018-08-03 21:42:09 Castor Oil is your best friend! Condition your hair regularly to give it moisture. Be patient. Leave it alone but really take care of it.
4215 2018-08-03 21:41:47 If you think there's a chance Urban Meyer won't be coaching the Buckeyes this year, I have some snake oil you should buy.

4226 2018-08-03 21:39:51 How do you get false lashes off? I’ve tried everything. Steaming my face, olive oil, coconut oil, a hot rag. They won’t come off 
4227 2018-08-03 21:39:45 If you have other herbs, more made for cookings, you can freeze them as icecubes in oil (I prefer olive) to drop in dishes :)

4230 2018-08-03 21:39:36 No oil used. Fat free natural yoga with cayenne pepper & paprika. Sesame rye crisp bread. Fingers crossed it’s low as delicious
4231 2018-08-03 21:39:21 Yeah I'd drive up in my Tesla and demand a free gearcase oil change.
4232 2018-08-03 21:38:59 How many plants to make a bottle of pure oil compared to stock market diluted? The ones with the license shouldn't be out of their cheaper way of growing medicine that Trudeau Drugmart won't carry. Need a green shake before & after chemo? Hopefully more Supreme Court cash?
4233 2018-08-03 21:38:55 2) The Holy oil can cure and prevent many problems. It is not mentioned at all in the New Testament. We have been manipulated from the truth once again and Satan laughs. If you want the recipe and directions email me at kimpaddock@ymail.com and I'll forward it. God bless.
4234 2018-08-03 21:38:43 Arrogant? Unless you have used this specific oil your post comes across like a hater. Matter of fact. Thanks for advertising for him. I need a oil change and I’m purchase a few quarts today. You are awesome 
4235 2018-08-03 21:38:18 Those are just oil stains.
4236 2018-08-03 21:38:10 1)Just had a pretty enlightening conversation with @Moyin_Oyelo . One of the major points I took was that Norway discovering oil was a good thing because they were an already mature society .So they handled the money from oil proceed really well but...
4237 2018-08-03 21:38:03 Now you’re thinking.  Wait until you start seeing some of these oil boys jump on.. lol
4238 2018-08-03 21:37:21 true - but remember in a minute or so, how many ppl would view this tweet? and, losing the retweet would be a good start, but how about the millions of ppl who read the tweet and believed it? remember data/information is the new oil 
4239 2018-08-03 21:37:20 vitamin E oil and aloe vera
4240 2018-08-03 21:37:14 Eh, butter isn't *that* bad for you XD

4242 2018-08-03 21:36:25 Talking of growing business sir, I appreciate the efforts of this government to decentralize our economy from oil. Yet young people like me who have idea to execute and have created models on which our business will stand fail to get the support we need. I need your help sir.

4245 2018-08-03 21:36:18 The questions are:
Was the oil hedge a good idea?
Did we benefit at all from the hedge?
Do we still need the SCT? 
What is the purpose of the SCT now?

It's in the Old Testament, the one that the cabal churches tell us not to read. It is virgin olive oil, cannabis buds, myrrh oil, cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon leaf oil....

4263 2018-08-03 21:33:47 I am also very glad that the storage boxes have well gasketed lids. The carrier liquid for pro oil dyes is pretty potent. When you open the box and look inside, it's sort of like sniffing about 30k magic markers all at once.

4283 2018-08-03 21:30:47 Yes, you use control fires to halt an out of control fire.  You you can stop an oil well fire with dynamite.  You can't talk either one out of burning, they only respond to the controlled use of power and force, because they are like criminals with guns.

4348 2018-08-03 21:22:13 Yes, scared the life out of me. I mixed a little water with the oil, this may not have helped

4351 2018-08-03 21:21:58 Really??  We just added another $847 billion in debt from Oct-Jun.  Probably surpass $1 trillion for fiscal 2018.  At some point, printing money won't offset falling oil production.
4352 2018-08-03 21:21:56 No idea, but does that mean no more baby oil for Finn?

Look at Abuja and it's growth, and stop being dense.
4355 2018-08-03 21:21:23 Again, we can't control what other countries do, but we can do our part. This also helps to protect the Canadian oil sands from attack.

4370 2018-08-03 21:18:44 So many liberals see it as a sign of their enlightenment to bash #Saudi_Arabia and advocate for the Iranian medieval theocracy. As to democracy and human rights, is there much difference between the two? Guess which country is America’s ally and spare oil production capacity?
4371 2018-08-03 21:18:34 as soon as i see a pimple start forming i floor it—as in i drown it in tea tree oil in hopes that it will fuck off
4372 2018-08-03 21:18:29 It has to do with mood , and it’s easier to manage a business than an artwork because I work on several art styles, pencil, ink, acrylics and mixed media. I don’t have a heart for oil painting though
4373 2018-08-03 21:18:20 Anointing oil
4374 2018-08-03 21:18:15 It turns milky when it’s wet so is easy to remove. Not like a standard balm/oil. I need to repurchase soon but the 30ml has lasted 4 days a week AM/PM use for a month so not bad for £3.5

4399 2018-08-03 21:15:31 G- he’s a  oil salesman always has been. He admitted that he knew about the 2015 incident in his statement & kept him for 3 more years—isn’t that enough to fire with cause? Also looks like he wants to take his superiors with him like if you take me down you go too.. thoughts

4444 2018-08-03 21:10:05 What?!! You'd usually use mallow for coughs. Mullein is your best better in an oil, followed up by tincture of Goldenseal

4448 2018-08-03 21:09:52 @gglightbulb 
Many of our school district students live w/in 2 miles of the nearest oil refinery. Questionable levels of emissions have reigned for years!

2 other refineries are w/in ~ 50 miles of our students

Trump’s planning on doing in the rest of us us like Puerto Rico...
4449 2018-08-03 21:09:51 Absolutely correct!
If your product or service Doesn't provide a Solution, you're just a snake oil salesman!
A speaker I saw once, insisted there was NO best anything!
Meaning my stuff is as good as anything else! Wrong!
There is a Best for your solution!
4450 2018-08-03 21:09:45 That's what spam propaganda accounts do. Being pro BEV is a front. Of course you post occasional negative fossil fuel tweets - so you can point to them when you get busted. Your main tweets are the same anti-FCEV threads sent to anyone posting H2 or FCEV news. Oil shill

4456 2018-08-03 21:08:27 You don’t tell your accountant how to do your taxes. And that’s your money. But no, tell your doctor how to save your life cuz Karen’s blog said to rub coconut oil on your armpits and sleep in a counter clockwise fashion.

4463 2018-08-03 21:06:45 If anyone has kids with peanut allergies, beware that they cook in peanut oil.
Don’t want to see a family day at the Bill ruined.
4464 2018-08-03 21:06:40 Awesome! Hopefully he will take the time to educate them on our crumbling economy and the basic needs for oil before “evicting” them. Not that there is one open mind in the bunch.
4465 2018-08-03 21:06:40 I tried it a couple of years ago and just made it worse. I’ve accepted I’m gonna have to bite the bullet and do it though. Cloning multiple oil spots out is tedious.
4466 2018-08-03 21:06:37 Tbh peppermint oil solves most of my problems
4467 2018-08-03 21:06:03 I'm sure you first did a geological survey to see if there was any oil or natural gas at the property first, but hey, good job and thank you for doing what is right this time.
4468 2018-08-03 21:05:48 Today the Niger Delta McGregor Laird described as having a soil too poor to produce a ton of palm oil is Nigeria's mineral oil-rich region.
4469 2018-08-03 21:05:38 You mean like selling anti-tank missiles to the Ukraine, or pushing LNG to Europe, or neutering Putin's global warming hoax that kept his oil prices high? You mean acting like that around Putin?
4470 2018-08-03 21:05:24 Probably too much flour. Also, coconut oil instead of butter

4482 2018-08-03 21:03:18 Make this no-rinse cleanser your bestie. The micelles within trap all dirt, oil and make-up, dissolving them for you to wipe them off like magic. Plus, a 2014 clinical study has proven this to boost skin hydration by up to 90 per cent. Genius! #tinyyetmighty

4491 2018-08-03 21:01:40 @ScottBaio makes Rand Paul seem philanthropic. Baio can't even book 1 of Mark Wahlberg's military or oil propaganda films let alone a gameshow gig. His 'having a career in acting' is as old as koosh balls and just as relevant. His hate will not help resurrect his b-star status.

4497 2018-08-03 21:01:17 Well let’s see. He withdrew from nuclear deal which reimposed sanctions. I do believe we stopped buy oil from them and encouraged others to stop as well. They just a week ago were begging us to but their oil. We have been working them in Syria. So yeah. Trump.
4498 2018-08-03 21:01:03 Ahhh the good old days before dumbass W and Cheney devastated the economy and blew our future invading the wrong country on pure lies so the oil corporations that helped put them in office could gain control in Iraq's massive conventional oil fields

4509 2018-08-03 20:59:39 More than the recipe is the variety of strains I believe.  Then infuse those into butter or oil and dose that as highly as you can.  You want almost equal CBD and THC.
4510 2018-08-03 20:59:35 ‘Engine runs sweat’, could possibly do with a top up of deodorant then? Perhaps that would cure the oil pump/pressure problem? Always nice to see a cold engine revved to 4K on start up! Tempted to leave a comment about it being a proper lemon...
4511 2018-08-03 20:59:34 I threw a bucket of oil at the tree but that only made it worse. :-(

4533 2018-08-03 20:57:02 @trumpjrcampain  Hey Donald I think you got more than 5000 miles on your hair I think it needs an oil change.
4534 2018-08-03 20:57:01 I enjoy changing my own oil. It’s cheaper, and I know exactly what’s going in the truck.
4535 2018-08-03 20:56:49 You work on an oil rig? 
4536 2018-08-03 20:56:45 Lol. Economic terrorist. That would be Big Oil/Capitalism. Not a dude trying to help the environment. Cool story though. You're very creative.

4542 2018-08-03 20:55:24 Today in the news, Nikolas Madurai admitted that socialism has failed in Venezuela, a country rich in oil.....what makes US Socialists think it would be different here??? Am I right?!
4543 2018-08-03 20:55:19 my only experience with IRAC was an attempt to evict me. 
1) too many delivery companies delivering parcels.
2) a “eviction party” which was deems quiet by police and was planned before eviction notice/hearing.
3) too much oil use & failed to fix broken hot water tap.

4553 2018-08-03 20:53:35 Thank you for the mention . I love an oil in the morning too. The smell is jasmine and a bit of rose essential oils. Jasmine is great for balancing skin and the scent is uplifting so a great start to the day. Hope the sensitive cheeks calm down soon too x
4554 2018-08-03 20:53:33 In the future if you feel that way and wanna take a bath, try lavender! It's NOT a hot oil, and it'll relax your stomach muscles and help clear sinuses  and you'll smell amazing! Haha

4562 2018-08-03 20:51:53 We have been saying the oil bubble will end since 80s bro.  They are diversifying their resources and that is where Somali ports come in.  They own approximately 80 ports in 49 countries.  We deserve the tragedy that befallen upon us. Lax walba shilalkay is dhigtaa lagu qalaa.
4563 2018-08-03 20:51:46 Our opinion is that with such significant dependence on oil, fluctuating oil prices and exchange rate, Nigeria is susceptible to foreign exchange risk.

In fact, our recession was as a result of fall in oil prices.

4568 2018-08-03 20:50:50 FYI to all the people preaching to cook with coconut oil. It’s worse for your heart than butter. 

Coconut oil is 90% saturated fat. Put it on your skin not in your mouth.

4722 2018-08-03 20:29:27 they dont have to, its built in the system lol. John D Rockefellor owner of standard oil, became the richest man in history NOT by raising the price of oil, but by lowering it to where every american could afford to buy it.

4742 2018-08-03 20:25:50 No. The lesson is be very wary of laws nakedly preferring some existing powerful group at the expense of those lacking power. The oil crisis itself was too obvious to be the lesson.

4754 2018-08-03 20:23:48 Ugh. Well the answer is   Not to have oil govt run. That’s what Mexico  and Venezuela do...

4759 2018-08-03 20:22:51 There was a debate over standard oil as to break them up or take it to the people. Our 1st anti-trust Law was passed. We were no longer a capitalist nation but a crony capitalist nation. Standard and Exxon are fairly familiar names I think.

And that is the importance of CNY oil contract.  For 1st time since Aug-71 (when choice was USD or gold), oil exporters have a choice of currencies.  Huge geopolitical, FX implications.

4783 2018-08-03 20:19:25 USA oil refineries rely on CDN crude for up to 20% of their supply. Having that CDN crude available at a ridiculously low price widens their crack spread & Increases margins. Go USA!  Only Canada would be so stupid as to force their own crude to a single market.

4794 2018-08-03 20:18:02 BEVs don't have oil changes, trucking will be electric.  I was talking about what we do with the vast majority of oil, which is burn it in cars. We aught use it less for fertalizer and plastic.

So very enlightening, I never knew petroleum was in so many things, not.</sarcasm>

4800 2018-08-03 20:17:19 Electric cars are taking over anyway. Without revenue from gasoline, you can expect oil prices to drop to single digits. May as well use carbon tax to fund training programs for the soon to be unemployed

4809 2018-08-03 20:16:04 Go to get the oil changed, find out you can’t because the muffler is falling off and they don’t want it to accidentally get ripped off. Lovely.
4810 2018-08-03 20:16:01 How/why do people take Ben Shapiro seriously? He’s one of the biggest snake oil salesmen on the internet.
4811 2018-08-03 20:15:59 You said the last big name - Davis was the last big name on a warren card from overseas. Not bothered if it’s Warren or Hearn, they’re both snake oil salesmen, or how many tickets either sell. I’m interested in the sport and seeing decent fights.
4812 2018-08-03 20:15:47 Could you explain what the sanctions are for? What has Iran done? It has dropped the petrodollar, and we find America always attacks country that do that. China buys oil with the gold backed Yuan. Syria, Libya, Iraq, Venezuela, & Russia in part have dropped the petrodollar!
4813 2018-08-03 20:15:29 I’m so pleased. I’ve just been in a state of anxiety for the olive oil. Fuck the clothes 
4814 2018-08-03 20:15:26 Finally got the oil change for my truck
4815 2018-08-03 20:15:25 Until crude oil finishes and they make enough money out of it. It is same business strategy everywhere, OLED technology was known in 2005 itself but released few years back, meanwhile they made money on TFT, Plasma, LCD, LED..
4816 2018-08-03 20:15:13  this tip. RT @Bohemiaaah: I just took a bowl of water and put a couple drops of jojoba oil in it and stirred it up and soaked my nails in it— my hands are so soft and smooth and my nails feel great :) i’d definitely recommend it!

4821 2018-08-03 20:14:28 Doesn’t work that way and you know it.  China must provide value to the exporter of oil in other current goods/services (balanced trade) or future goods/services (capital account).  The CNY denominated oil is simply an attempt to avoid US controlled SWIFT/USD banking system
4822 2018-08-03 20:14:27 I will laugh if Fox brings you on to debate Ben Shapiro. Secular Talk truthteller vs fast talking used car salesman! On another subject, we need to go renewables so corporate media has less drive to start another war over oil.
4823 2018-08-03 20:13:49 Don't you dare ruin olive oil for me
4824 2018-08-03 20:13:30 Hey, you’re the one who talked about the women on oil platforms, not me. 
And, although you’re entirely entitled to have your opinion, I don’t have time to waste, on people like you, who have their minds set and don’t care.
Bye.

4828 2018-08-03 20:13:20 African American unemployment has been trending lower for years before Trumpy stole the presidency. But like any good con-man worth his snake oil, he’s taking full credit, and being given it by his delusional base, for something he has next to nothing to do with. Bravo!

4831 2018-08-03 20:12:12 Did the Minister of Finance Dr. Nigel Clarke admit that the special tax being collected for the abandoned oil hedge fund is currently being misappropriated? Furthermore the government will have to keep misappropriating it because we are not in a position to do without it????
4832 2018-08-03 20:12:12 There is no change with the EU. You are really easy fo fool! Whatever trump lied, nothing has been agreed, no more soy beans has been bought, no more oil has been bought.

4843 2018-08-03 20:10:36 One of several viable alternative materials. World economies need to make room to allow for sustainable options to compete against the massive production of petroleum based plastic products. But that would be bad for oil companies. #SDGs

4860 2018-08-03 20:08:05 Are you asking that the money be stopped from oil company corp taxes and income taxes that thousands in the oil patch pay?  How might all the free stuff lefties like be financed?
4861 2018-08-03 20:08:02 There are different distributors online but I order mine from Hemp Heals and I like their CBD oil and it has done an incredible job with pain but it has definitely reduced my anxiety. If you want info or my contact just let me know
4862 2018-08-03 20:08:02 @storiesofabbie Hi Abbie. We're sorry to hear that the Emma Hardie oil isn't coming out. Can you please send us over a DM with your order number and ASOS registered email address so that we can have a look into this? We look forward to hearing from you.
4863 2018-08-03 20:07:54 I am realizing today that the people that painted this house before we moved in must have used an oil based paint and that has got to be why the latex paint I used knicks so easily. 

I can't think of any of other reason for it to happen as often as it does.
4864 2018-08-03 20:07:51 Seems if you got oil like Russia and the Saud's, you got his love.  Just wait till he realizes that scientists weren't kidding, particularly about the abrupt kid of change.  He'll get his alright.  But then, we all will.  Good luck.

4870 2018-08-03 20:07:10 I get sooooo excited when I find new data about conifer oil composition, it's starting to be ridiculous.
Like, a good pickup line for me would be to ask me about alpha-pinene variation between conifer species.
4871 2018-08-03 20:07:10 Make sure your lanterns are filled with the pure, unadulterated oil of Truth, not some watered down, synthetic version of truth, which is really no truth at all. Study to show yourself approved.
4872 2018-08-03 20:07:04 stop contradicting yourself, read what you wrote,don't try to beat around the bush,why then were you asking for my age? If it really doesn't matter as you're trying to accept.
I'm not up to your age,but I'm sure my political struggle on field surpass your keyboard apprenticeship.
4873 2018-08-03 20:06:34 I don't know.  The future looks grim.  Even under Obama, we had one of the largest oil spills in history in the Gulf of Mexico.  A year later they were back to drilling baby drill.  Obama tried more than once to open up drilling in the Arctic.  Hillary spent half her time running
4874 2018-08-03 20:05:57 He emptied the whole fucking bottle. Does God really care if you don't use enough oil to feed a country? Or is it just so you look like you're doing something profound?
4875 2018-08-03 20:05:51 And gets a share of oil revenues...
4876 2018-08-03 20:05:49 He has lowered a large number of peoples taxes, spurring bonuses, massively cut regulations and restarted the oil and coal industry in many states, huge drop in unemployment 11+ records set up to now, looking at Voter ID and election reform, enforcing the law, big vets boost...
4877 2018-08-03 20:05:35 Why would I bother doing all that work to drill for oil or grow the corn when I can simply print currency & buy futures on both - seems like China has come to that conclusion w CNY oil contract, no?

4891 2018-08-03 20:03:51 This explains why so many  North  Americans are so far behind EU and China. The billions spent by Big Oil were strategic and successful. In spite of recent assertions the oil lobby continues to promote spurious pseudo science and political hackery intended to spread confusion.
4892 2018-08-03 20:03:12 Because we can’t dress how we want to all the time. We also aren’t trying to impress people who call changing oil a career #extraAF

4896 2018-08-03 20:02:50 No. Oil prices crashed and so did the value of the company.

4902 2018-08-03 20:01:37 I've seen more times than I can count.  No one in this great country of ours is stuck in their current circumstances.  They can't find enough oil field workers in N.

4903 2018-08-03 20:01:34 I actually work in the oil &gas industry and it’s really hard to fill positions. I just arrived here in Odessa, TX 5 mins ago lol

4928 2018-08-03 19:58:54 They aren't socialists. They are a batch of countries the size of states, that got rich off of oil and implemented govt run social systems. Their own leaders say they aren't socialists. The last few years they've had to cut back on their safety net budget.

4950 2018-08-03 19:55:04 Jojoba oil is the best for nail growth, it is really similar to the oils our nails actually produce and it can get in between the layers and help your nails to bend rather than snap. Plus it is great for cuticles.

Name & Firm ???
4957 2018-08-03 19:53:59 And Corbyn would stop all of this. The change of foreign policy and resulting loss of arms sales is what the establishment fears. Oil and arms is what this is all about.
4958 2018-08-03 19:53:56 Most Republicans don't believe there was collusion with Russia, recent polling shows. These people don't trust the media. They only trust Trump. I can't believe his numbers are still strong with the Republican base. Unhappy? We'd have boots on the ground by now in Syria for oil.
4959 2018-08-03 19:53:49 How old were u when saraki was governor, do u know wot kwara was like before he became governor? Now wot research have u done that made u conclude that saraki is bad? Wot do u even know about the man? I don't blame u sha, I blame the corrupt media that shaped ur thots.
4960 2018-08-03 19:53:49 No one can accept that Somali people will have 5% of their oil. Struggle to liberate western Somali (#Ogaden) will continue. @ONLFofficial has the right to fight for the right of Somali people and re-wage war against Abyssinian occupation. #Ethiopia #DDSI #ONLF #Oromo, #Ogaden.

4962 2018-08-03 19:53:30 @mikebrewer I've just finished watching the Toyota supra 1982 episode. Why are you classing cream residue under an oil cap as head gasket failure when it could clearly be down to condensation from short journeys or pcv problems? Could end up costing people?
4963 2018-08-03 19:53:22 i called my dad hoping he’d come with me because i’m legit so embarrassed i have NO OIL KDJSNDNS but here i am! by myself! looking like a fool!
4964 2018-08-03 19:53:12 Imagine for a moment an oil or gas company setting up an oil rig across from the vatican...that’s what happening right now. It’s time to stop fossil fuels...NO NEW PIPELINES @Deb4CongressNM #NN18
4965 2018-08-03 19:53:06 I say again 159 countries are in WTO with 24 more looking to join v EU 27. We already import equipment services from USA for UK oil gas with no tariffs or import duties collected at ports. It has been that way for 50 yrs yet somehow the oil keeps producing.

4974 2018-08-03 19:51:38 I understand the oil theory. But could it just be because they hate the other?
4975 2018-08-03 19:50:55 When’s the last time you changed the oil?
4976 2018-08-03 19:50:51 oil paint isn’t dangerous, if you have common sense not to fucking eat it you’ll be fine, why are people saying “don’t let it touch your skin!!!! it has hard chemicals!!” just wash it off fuck

4982 2018-08-03 19:49:11 immigrants being integrated into the American variety of Anglo-Saxon culture. Blacks have been in the US for centuries and they did not integrate properly. Just think if it is possible for the US to continue to exist as you know it if Europeans are no longer the majority.
4983 2018-08-03 19:48:58 The possibility raised of using oil fires on the ocean to steer hurricanes seems crazy now.
4984 2018-08-03 19:48:57 Okay, I respect that perspective. But I just want to point out that the US has been a European majority country throughout its existence, and the success story of US immigrants that everyone tells about how immigrants can integrate is really the success story of European

4992 2018-08-03 19:47:29 Define mess. Stable, growing economy. Being outperformed because oil is on a slight upturn, but will continue to grow even when oil dips again... that’s a mess?
4993 2018-08-03 19:47:15 Not a blogger, but am an artist/mental health practitioner, and know CBD oil was a game changer for my #OCD #anxiety - happy to contribute in some way
4994 2018-08-03 19:47:14 Idk if it’s bc of the weather, but my hair was a MESS after a shower today. Super frizzy and big. My leave-in conditioner wasn’t even fixing it. Had to put some coconut oil mist in it so it can settle down. 
4995 2018-08-03 19:47:00 Is there any data suggesting DeepWater for the next 1 to 2 years will offset FOGM decline and the overall decreasing EIA-914 trend?  Also, do you have any faith in the mid-month DPR's from the EIA showing a decreasing trend in average new well production forecasts for oil shale?

5005 2018-08-03 19:45:21 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
5006 2018-08-03 19:45:19 Comparing KSA to Iraq (let's ignore the kingdom vs democracy), the distribution of social benefit, via oil revenue, remains very problematic. US destruction of infrastructure, social fabric & public service plays a major role in this challenge. It is a nation on the razors edge.

5021 2018-08-03 19:43:49 @Love_bug1016 Hell no... it's a dual to the death of the tires! Or oil change. And things like ConfunctionJunction count somehow.
5022 2018-08-03 19:43:47 "(though the large jump in 2000 is partially explained by a change in how the data were reported — the number of firms reporting vegetable oil production increased that year)."

5031 2018-08-03 19:42:34 What about civil wars where genocide happens because one group doesn't like the other group? Like Rwanda for example? War happens for more than oil or resources. Read a history book honey. Stop being ignorant.
5032 2018-08-03 19:42:30 If your truck isn’t dirty are you really working in the oil fields?
5033 2018-08-03 19:42:20 Dandelion oil can help moisturize hair and soothe a dry, itchy scalp. If you have dry skin you can consider taking 360mg of borage seed oil daily.

5035 2018-08-03 19:42:17 No, it is all those damn scientists and their huge grants spreading misinformation. Because everyone knows that the big bucks are in science. Not in the Oil industry or anything like that. No, those are saints just trying to survive. Scientists man... Those are the worst.
5036 2018-08-03 19:42:13 Russia is also selling (donating?) them oil in international waters, pumping it from tanker ship to tanker ship.
5037 2018-08-03 19:42:13 And our history of using third world countries as dumping ground for our waste is criminal. What we do with coal ash is criminal. Oil sands and huge piles of left-over sulfur. Sulfur flow batteries are one possible destination for that, anyway. CA has one in operation.
5038 2018-08-03 19:42:02 Update from NS Power: 
-95% of the oil that made it into the water was contained in the first boom 
- the oil released is now contained.

5047 2018-08-03 19:41:31 It's an easy task, just carefully lubricate it. Add enough oil on your palm and start rubbing it circularly. Do it in a closely ranged motion and when you get to the center; just Twist it a Lil
5048 2018-08-03 19:41:21 So far only thing that kind of helped was ibuprofen to take down the swelling lol not even CBD oil helped
5049 2018-08-03 19:41:12 Welp that will never happen. Smash chats can be bad enough but FGC chats just have friends and shitposter celebrities as mods who often throw oil into the fire.

In UKCS we think that we can last 30-40 yrs but with the development of BEVs the demand for transport fuels could diminish by 20% of the next 20yrs.

5086 2018-08-03 19:37:56 Do you know what’s exhausting? Getting your oil changed. Not changing your own oil. Driving to the auto place, sitting in the little waiting room and then paying and leaving. Exhausting.

5098 2018-08-03 19:35:48 Jesus wouldn’t chase these money changers from the temple. He’d drop the temple on ‘em and use the oil smooshed from their carcasses to light the homes of the poor.

Have you thought of hydro therapy or chiropractor?

5105 2018-08-03 19:34:39 @almondbreeze And they use palm oil, which leads to deforestation, death of critically endangered species (like the orangutan), displacement of indigenous peoples, enslavement of workers in atrocious plantation conditions, and exacerbation of global warming.  #noconflictpalmoil

5160 2018-08-03 19:28:17 Yep during the oil crash, everyone was hiring then, wait a minute.
5161 2018-08-03 19:28:07 remember the time when i was doing a routine oil check on my car and some random dude crossed the whole gas station parking lot to tell me “wow i’ve never seen a woman check her oil before,” waited for my positive response, and then walked away when i didn’t say anything
5162 2018-08-03 19:28:05 Vitol’s Ian Taylor on oil deals with dictators and drinks with Fidel-  Isn't this shows hypocrisy at its best. The English and media attacks whoever deal with these so-called dictators, allowing their own immoral dealings to go on, unnoticed.

5169 2018-08-03 19:27:05 And on that note, it’s wash day. 
It really grinds my gears that it takes me 6-8 hours to wash, deep condition, oil, retwist, and dry my hair.
5170 2018-08-03 19:27:04 The courtesy car BMW gave me for my last oil change was a sedan, a 4-cyl, single turbo and didn’t even have a sound system. All Bimmers ain’t created equal at all. I was miserable lmao
5171 2018-08-03 19:27:02 Kris will lie and try to cheat. Too bad he’s has been getting caught. How many millions has you snake oil cost the taxpayers? How could you lose a court case on the subject you were the #1 Expert in the US (or so you claimed)? Contempt of court much? There’s your sign..

5173 2018-08-03 19:26:35 Saying capitalism is responsible for global warming isn't saying oil companies are. Desire for cheap goods, cheap airplane startups, cheap cars, cheap everything has led to this. But a lot of that is capitalism driven.
5174 2018-08-03 19:26:34 Combine 1 teaspoon peppermint tea leaves, 4 teaspoons white tea leaves 1/2 cup boiled distilled water and 2 drops of lavender oil combine with aloe Vera gel. Helps with inflamed or acne-prone skin.
5175 2018-08-03 19:26:23 I just tried some chili oil sauce from Safeway and I didn’t think it would be that hot. As of right now my tits are on fire.
5176 2018-08-03 19:25:52 Nop. Not for us!! Nothing that has excess of sodium, sugars, flour, vegetable oil... nothing like that. We completely changed our diet. 
5177 2018-08-03 19:25:41 why do oil changes cost so much money i’m getting rid of my car forever
5178 2018-08-03 19:25:40 Do I know this? yes. Did I knew it when I moved here? no. Would it have changed my choice? YES. Initiative 97 is for "NEW oil and gas development", not pre-existing. And BTW, I signed the petition for it this morning. Thanks to you.

5192 2018-08-03 19:23:58 It's an illusion that the federal govt is subsidizing trillions in the oil and gas industry. Walmart, Amazon are subsidized so heavily they pay effectively zero taxes.
Expanding Medicare would only crush the health insurance industry. (No tears lost.)
5193 2018-08-03 19:23:57 If I never see the Oil Ranch again in my lifetime I’d be cool with that.

5229 2018-08-03 19:17:31 The reason orange juice isn’t used in most traditional cocktails is that the acidity is much lower than lemons and limes and so it’s difficult to make balance. The peel and oil is used as a garnish often.

5242 2018-08-03 19:16:00 (1/2) I want to clarify on this one. If she buys the essential oils from regular store, then it is toxic for dogs. Essential oils from store sucks. If people buy them from essential oil companies such as Young Living or Doterra, it prob will not be toxic as it should be.

5247 2018-08-03 19:15:02 Don’t trust this.
Millions of people use coconut oil daily for cooking and no heightened risk rate is reported among them.

Either made from hemp or Cannabis. Has no buzz, just relieves symptoms. TRY IT 
5255 2018-08-03 19:13:28 I don't think its more advanced.Mediums that have similar "drying" properties generally work better together- So watercolors with oil paints wouldn't work because the oils can sometimes take months even years to fully dry. But once WC dry-theyre dry so you can use charcoal on it

5328 2018-08-03 19:04:27 no not really, the Billions received in oil royalties and and ancillary spin off tax revenue from high salaries and equipment is the handshake for exploration costs.  If there's a market for charging stations private enterprise should and will fill it.

5377 2018-08-03 18:58:34 Money the government rely on oil and money that comes from the oil industry and they all are Muslim country's that have it ,can be my only explanation as to why our lives mean so little to the people in charge always follow the Money
5378 2018-08-03 18:58:20 if you date someone with a car are you obligated to pay for their gas and oil changes from the very first day you start dating? at what point does the obligation become a shared one? i understand having kids is different but im not sure the "holistic" approach is this cut and dry
5379 2018-08-03 18:58:05 Its also worth pointing out that the decision to carry this debt, rather than say properly managing the countrys oil income in a similar way to Norway was entirely the choice of the UK Government with majority English representation. We should not be punished for bad management.
5380 2018-08-03 18:57:50 Oil change already?
5381 2018-08-03 18:57:38 Get a tea tree oil and a small sized Blue Bunny ice cream. 

Thanks

5383 2018-08-03 18:57:04 I asked my hubs to pack my lunch and I saw him with a spoon of some off white colored something that he threw into the trash. I realized he threw away the oil/fat solid from the refrigerated chicken. How sweet of him. Seems lame to some of you I’m sure but that gesture pleased me
5384 2018-08-03 18:57:04 Very true. They fail to understand that NO Congress or commie businessman will invest in Oil alternatives ; renewable energy or nuclear power which reduces deficit. Only nationalist businessmen like Adani will do. They're totally funded from abroad.
5385 2018-08-03 18:56:53 /6/. Venezuela owes debts denominated in foreign currency and relies on oil revenue to pay those debts.  Oil prices crashed.  America never borrows in a foreign currency & satisfies all its obligations in its own currency which we create at will.
5386 2018-08-03 18:56:51 The sandwich I order at Jimmy John’s and the noodles I order at the Sichuanese place are both number 14.

5390 2018-08-03 18:56:32 I had heard some shit about black seed oil, my dad told me some shit about it and he really sold me. But I went and got some and have been taking it (nasty shit) 
& I drank a lot last night like swallow your shot twice drank a lot.
I feel great and slept like magic on clouds.

You have far too much confidence in your ability to survive.
You want the oil that's under the poles.

5395 2018-08-03 18:55:44 Agreed. Health and education should be a natural human expectation, an inalienable right, not treated as an commodity or choice only for the rich. The government should work on behalf of the people and not the lobbyists and deep pockets of BigPharma, Insurance, Oil,Wall Street.

5400 2018-08-03 18:54:55 I think so. Great time for a news dump while we're all cracking up at a presentation on Snake Oil Strawmen.
5401 2018-08-03 18:54:53 That looks like an awesome project! Maybe try a penetrating oil on the seized screws? I’ve refurbished old woodworking tools from the 70’s that had damage from rust. After leaving the right type of oil on seized bolts or machine screws for a few days they finally loosened up.
5402 2018-08-03 18:54:52 Moisturize! Even really great soaps can dry out your skin. I love Aveeno lotion and mix in some coconut oil.
5403 2018-08-03 18:54:41 Nice to see we've learned absolutely nothing from the past. America switched to smaller cars in the '80s following the OPEC oil embargo. That another crisis will come is inevitable, the only questions are when and how.

No response from oil minister but Adanis filed a Rs100 crore civil defamation & separate criminal defamation.
5406 2018-08-03 18:54:23 No. The oil companies make much more exporting than they can get here. It would drive prices down here. Good for us , bad for them. Then they’ll jack prices up here claiming an “shortage “, They’ve got to get their money!

5417 2018-08-03 18:52:22 Oh man that sucks. I really want to believe it was bad timing but I thought that dealers would do complementary inspections for every oil change? It all just seems strange.
5418 2018-08-03 18:52:09 Every time i come here to get my oil changed, i want a new Malibu.  i need to sit my ass down and enjoy not having a car note.

5425 2018-08-03 18:51:41 It doesn’t work like that. Oil tariffs will raise prices for you. Those companies just lost a major buyer. They’ll make up the difference by charging you more. China will just buy more from Canada and Russia.
5426 2018-08-03 18:51:38 I always thought me & my friends took car camping to a different level, what with our fancy lights and our cooking... until my bf proved he was glamp master by packing up a duvet, folding up a grill, adding truffle oil to the steak marinade and charging some giant battery thing.

5428 2018-08-03 18:51:30 #CNBC has stated oil has closed down three days in a row. Don't celebrate. 1/3 of a percent down. But it indicates that even with frenetic dark trades by Putin and his friends the Kochs, oil is declining.

5432 2018-08-03 18:50:48 I'm waiting on an oil change for my car. In the background is a documentary going over various things. They mentioned a man named Daisuke, and I have to chuckle hearing them pronounce it "die-SOO-kay" when I know Japanese people would pronounce it "DIE-skay".

5446 2018-08-03 18:48:54 Doesn't this mean there is more oil domestically, maybe lower consumer prices? Why is it a bad thing? #economics ?

5465 2018-08-03 18:47:12 It’s a big help if you have some compressed air to clear out the fibres, and some machine oil works great on finishing it up! I had to do exactly the same on my 30’s one when I got it because it didn’t look like it had been cleaned since then!

5473 2018-08-03 18:46:05 On a [mostly] unrelated note, what's their long game once the oil money slows down? Are they building up infrastructure for that, or are they just leaving it as an elephant in the room?

5512 2018-08-03 18:40:42 Pretty sure I just creeped out the tech that’s changing my oil since my Bluetooth was on while I watched snap stories......
5513 2018-08-03 18:40:41 The 'terrible trade deals' Trump's been carrying on about, those were first & foremost about getting cheap resources, services, & labor for US consumers (esp oil), & 'opening markets' for American products & services (esp ag). The contradiction has been obvious the whole time.

5515 2018-08-03 18:40:20 Having a car is cool until you have to get your brakes fixed or an oil change and pay for your gas and insurance or have to drive it a long distance
5516 2018-08-03 18:40:11 The explanation given today spent more time pointing fingers @ the PNPGOJ. It was a policy decision similar to the policy in the exchange rate not to bother with it. Oil prices nkw climbing the J$ declining & the GOJ do not have the spine to own up. Ja needs real leadership.

5519 2018-08-03 18:40:07 for the oil change. Somehow the transmission is screw up and he has about 30,100 miles on it now and they won’t fix it for him because it is not under warranty.. I don’t know how that suddenly happens when there was no problems with the car..
5520 2018-08-03 18:40:05 If your skin is dry, try using aloe vera for face masks and rose oil to moisturize. Also try face washes that don't have salicylic acid in them
5521 2018-08-03 18:40:05 Babygirl....I could light a fire in your soul right now...imma pull up with the baby oil and handcuffs just wait on it 
5522 2018-08-03 18:39:58 Customer service. There cars are great. My friend has had a Jeep for three years.. he is leasing his current one and brought it in for an oil change with 29,950 miles on it last week.. the warranty is for 30,000 miles. There was nothing wrong with the car when he brought it in

5527 2018-08-03 18:39:15 Interesting how you equate the US military that has done what it has always done as the result of a mixed economy and crony capitalism. I'd say those days were over but we've totally tossed in 2 planetary fortunes trying to gank Iraq for its oil.

5535 2018-08-03 18:38:39 It is air force and army to chase the Boko haram, Armed Fulani Herdsmen and other bandits in the north, it is navy and police for kidnapping and oil theft in the south. when they occur, they are deployed. It keeps happening, they keep deploying them. No direction, they are killed
5536 2018-08-03 18:38:26 Professions like engineers, doctors, even carpenters have to uphold professionalism & held accountable for their work. If journalism get free pass, then it can’t be regarded as a professionalism, & be hold same level as snake oil salesmen.
5537 2018-08-03 18:38:11 We offer full synthetic blend oil changes.... That's a new one... #idiot
5538 2018-08-03 18:38:01 Cant have big oil and solar/wind get some real competition now can we? Anyway, big oil comps will eventually move to nuclear and renewables eventually when fossil fuels dry out. But we ordinary lowly consumers? They get to bleed us dry first before that happens.

5543 2018-08-03 18:37:18 Dear car nigga,

Change my oil and my oil only.

I can change my own damn air filter without paying a $70 labor charge.
5544 2018-08-03 18:37:15 Oh Christ, dodge subject redirect to LV nonsense. BTW those Saudi princes were arrested because the Kingdom is in the middle of a cash crunch due to low oil prices. Notice how most of those princes are now free? They bought their freedom.

Still waiting on a good reason to be "anti-globalist"... You do realize most manufacturers import parts, right? Down to coconut oil. And metal. And spices.
5550 2018-08-03 18:36:33 I should get some kind of reward for not dumping a whole pot of coffee, pitcher of beer, or oil over my ex when he showed up at lunch. His friend should know better than to bring him here.

They need to stay the frack out of our country !
5569 2018-08-03 18:34:22 reading about the oil industry and laughing the jaw off my skull remembering how, once, i was told not to bring up or complain about fracking at a party b/c a friend of a friend's dad was an oil baron and no on wanted the friction

5580 2018-08-03 18:33:17 Yay for successes for you! <3

I dressed myself today, turned in paperwork for a part time job, got my oil changed in my car, had lunch with a friend, and went to the bank.
5581 2018-08-03 18:33:12 Hahahaha. I’m so fucking impressed with your stupidity. That’s wrong, it’s the other way. Amazed by the fact that one calls himself oil trdr and dont know this.
5582 2018-08-03 18:33:02 Ha! How well you know me. 

A while ago I ran up a mountain and changed the oil in my car ON THE SAME DAY. Slightly spoiled the fragile masculinity by pausing for an espresso martini, and being taught to change oil by my housemate's girlfriend...
5583 2018-08-03 18:32:57 @jiffylube so your location on state line road in KC can't change the oil on my fiat, you have the filter but no tool, 20 minutes to tell me that
5584 2018-08-03 18:32:52 I'm actually really thinking of bringing baby oil back.
5585 2018-08-03 18:32:28 @RIMOWA I have a Salsa Deluxe carry-on, which is great but the wheels have started squeaking like crazy. Any suggestions for an easy fix and/or should I use regular grease, silicone-based oil, etc? Thanks!
5586 2018-08-03 18:32:18 It's future oil reserves.
5587 2018-08-03 18:32:02 99% of Azerbaijanis dont see a drop of benefit from that oil which has been poured into its oligarchic families and their offshore investments. SOCAR has been fingered as being a conduit for the Azerbaijan Laundromat which bribed officials throughout the world,most notably in CoE
5588 2018-08-03 18:31:57 oil provided excesses of food and fed a population that  expanded to five or six times the sustainable level of the planet in 200 years
when our brief light of civilisation goes out,  we return to the darkness whence we came.
5589 2018-08-03 18:31:57 If @TransMtn wasn't greedy, they would be a much better neighbor. @SFU and many of current residents occupying around the Burnaby Tank Farm does not justify oil tank expansion; there's 10000s people in between tanks now.
5590 2018-08-03 18:31:55 I went to the oil change place, so dumbass pulls my truck out, I get in, he had grease all over his back, its now on my back.  I cleaned the seat but my shirt is trashed.
5591 2018-08-03 18:31:09 the “why ban straws when we could ban oil pipelines” discourse is not productive but like...why ban straws when we could also ban literally Any Other single-use plastic WITHOUT hurting disabled people? where’s the anti-plastic bottle energy??
5592 2018-08-03 18:31:08 He said raises he did not say who gets themBecause company heads and ceo's do  .Not the city workers not the mail person not the trash truck driver I could go on Like the pipeline build it gas and oil will be cheaper Oh wait but not for the consumer just oil/gas companies

5596 2018-08-03 18:30:35 is the dollar really based on Saudi oil ?
5597 2018-08-03 18:30:31 I'm pretty sure the WMDs came from @GOP to justify why we went to begin with. Cause it wasn't about oil, am I right? And the only media manipulating people is going to be @FoxNews with fear mongering propoganda.

5616 2018-08-03 18:28:26 By the 19th/early 20th century, active trade relations between Bonny and Ngwa and Ndoki grew with the introduction of the palm oil era. Local small 'ports' were established within and Ndoki, known as 'Onumiri/Onumini' where Ibani middlemen did business with Ngwa/Ndoki villages.

5621 2018-08-03 18:27:48 1. Have a skin routine

3. Dont wash ur hair everyday
It removes all the oil and natural vitimans that the hair needs 
4. So a face mask once a week 
5. Add creams everyday after shower

5636 2018-08-03 18:25:18 The GOJ was never paying attention as oil prices started to rise without the hedge in place. Hedging is just that, you may benefit as well as you may not but when you get it right it make sense. Again the GOJ spend more time pointing to the PNP GOJ & not taking responsibility.
5637 2018-08-03 18:24:59 Took my car in for an oil change that I'd been delaying. Of course there are other issues with it. It is 10 years old & has 135k miles on it and the things they mentioned I know have never been done on it, but at some point I'd like to stop pouring money into this car.

5639 2018-08-03 18:24:40 Works out cheaper to supplement with coconut oil tbh, 60% average Mct concentration. Unless youve got £££ (or $$$) to burn on pure mct oil
5640 2018-08-03 18:24:23 That's what $10 million from the oil and gas industry will buy you
5641 2018-08-03 18:23:26 Im up in the air about incesting in bio oil too i might but we’ll see
5642 2018-08-03 18:22:45 Amir Shah of KTN’s Ho JamalO - if you want to see something original and zany. He has makeup, dance and  braiding contests. Plus antakshri.
5643 2018-08-03 18:22:37 Where are you now? I’m just about to leave Lucas Oil!
5644 2018-08-03 18:22:36 I use a hot spot spray on my pup that contains tea tree oil and is perfectly safe for him, but only because it’s been diluted!tea tree oil itself is safe as long as it’s only 0.1-1% concentrated, but a lot of the products we use for ourselves are way more than that!
5645 2018-08-03 18:22:32 Hellllll naaahhhhhh I just paid 80 dollars for my oil change
5646 2018-08-03 18:22:21 The new oil free is my go to in the Arizona heat!!
5647 2018-08-03 18:22:16 The anointing is the gift of grace that saves you. It cannot be earned by human effort! It’s salvation grace! Fresh oil of God on all flesh! 
5648 2018-08-03 18:22:12 You need peppermint oil
5649 2018-08-03 18:22:03 You buy petrol/diesel from the pumps, not crude oil.
Whos pumping billions into the North Sea?
You tell us how many?

You're dying to tell us, but I suspect you won't. 
5650 2018-08-03 18:21:53 How about a fetish for the taste of freezing cold oil spills under cars, wow!
5651 2018-08-03 18:21:51 This is why July sales have been lower than las 20yrs. The reduction of foreign $ in VanRE is the equivalent of an oil collapse in Alberta.
5652 2018-08-03 18:21:47 I've been saying that for years waste of $ meanwhile oil 
& over population is killing us. The republiCONs refuse science only if they can pocket $ off it. Earth destroyed by greed.
5653 2018-08-03 18:21:21 Here is A recent painting I have finished, Oil on panel 18x24.
5654 2018-08-03 18:21:16 I got hot ass oil sprayed in my face and goofy was still making me laugh after words. I love that kid 
5655 2018-08-03 18:21:12 We have no food, so spaghetti squash and an olive oil/lemon juice/ vinegar dressing it is

5657 2018-08-03 18:20:59 Bitcoin is not for spending at present. Value is still transferring into BTC from the dollar asymmetrically, and will more than offset any losses due to hyperinflation. So spend the fiat toilet paper while you can. Look for dollar to degrade this autumn due to oil getting yuaned.
5658 2018-08-03 18:20:55 We also cannot aggregate houses/real estate into meaningful groups unlike real assets such as Oil or financial securities. Aggregated mortgages suffers from same flaw.
5659 2018-08-03 18:20:42 I need a man to change my oil or teach me how to do it so I won’t have to pay for it
5660 2018-08-03 18:20:39 The only games I am interested in seeing played in Lucas Oil are tabletop games. #gencon2018

5663 2018-08-03 18:20:25 WHAT A PRODUCTIVE DAY. Got an oil change, my brakes looked at, and a tire rotation. Also heard some good work news. I can’t wait to nap, this is so exhausting.
5664 2018-08-03 18:20:24 All about selling oil!
5665 2018-08-03 18:20:13 If only dem manage the "oil, oil, oil" well self.

5670 2018-08-03 18:19:57 I guess I’m just curious how many vegans there are that see a tablespoon of dairy as horrible while also constantly buying products with palm oil since both are cruel and both lead to the suffering of animals and the destruction of the planet. I’m raw so I don’t eat it! 
5671 2018-08-03 18:19:54 @wonderchef I just purchased a brand new Nutriblend but I smell oil/grease when it starts, probably from its motor. Is this normal?
5672 2018-08-03 18:19:48 Oil revenues that Mr. Williams said wouldn’t be used but flip flopped on after he retired so flippantly.
5673 2018-08-03 18:19:40 How long does a fucking oil change take man

5675 2018-08-03 18:19:28 Numbers 3 and 4 from Morristown today. Will probably do a nocturne tonight at the Remington museum. Wish me luck! These are 9 x 12 and 12 x 24. Both oil.
5676 2018-08-03 18:19:27 the jeep is registered and renewed and shes abt to get a bath, inside and out, and get an oil change and then im gonna drive her nonstop for the next uhhhh 72 hours. who wants to take a quick road trip
5677 2018-08-03 18:19:15 @Gen_Con Moves gaming to Lucas Oil, but no outside food or drink allowed in even though you can do it anywhere in the con center. Unbelievable. So many changes that hurt the gamers this year. $$$ over experience.

5683 2018-08-03 18:18:21 It seems a bit of coincidence tho that pep has managed Barca Bayern & City that are bank rolled by banks or oil money. 

Yes he can't do a Porto or Inter now, but Jose has taken them teams and won it.

Both great managers but wud like to have seen Pep with a above average side
5684 2018-08-03 18:18:03 I went to get a oil change fucked around got some extra shit

5688 2018-08-03 18:17:34 Yesterday morning: 
Oops, we have a mouse. Poor wee fella. Let's sprinkle some peppermint oil around, and put away all the food at night.

Last night in bed: 
ARRGH! MOUSE! Holy muck, a mouse just walked across my FACE!!! NUKE IT FROM ORBIT, ITS THE ONLY WAY TO BE SURE!!!
5689 2018-08-03 18:17:32 no plan? the Feds are worse - flip flop on carbon tax -  pump more oil from the oil sands as fast as possible - was the Paris Agreement just a photo op for political capital ?  where is the leadership ?
5690 2018-08-03 18:17:31 Peace doesn’t let you control the Opium & other drugs. Three most profitable commodities - oil, weapons, & drugs. When asking why about our foreign policy, one of these is usually the answer.
5691 2018-08-03 18:17:27 Ok, but you're assuming California would/could survive without the US and that we'd be direly hurt by them leaving. It's the other way around. California could survive for a decade or so, but then it'd become Venezuela with open borders and no oil.
5692 2018-08-03 18:17:25 Yes, but, without the LG the project would have died its rightful death.  O matter how we carve it, we will pay, either slowly or quickly, and most likely use up oil revenues to pay for hydro. Sad. These revenues could have done so much more.
5693 2018-08-03 18:17:17 Watched a video on it shit takes so much just to change the oil on it
5694 2018-08-03 18:17:00 Adult question of the day: why THE FUCK is printer ink so goddamn expensive?! Apparently oil isn't the only liquid gold out there smh... 
5695 2018-08-03 18:16:37 World market oil prices high, exchange rate increasing so petrol price will remain high. Cost of production & everything else will rise. Hope 4 no increase in tax.#workwithit#ivewithit

5707 2018-08-03 18:15:28 Over 10,000 workers at the state owned Oil Co have walked off the #jobs because their salaries are worthless.  14,000% #inflation!  Even though they have the largest #oil reserves on earth...6 x s the US.  Only communism or socialism could screw that up!

5713 2018-08-03 18:15:09 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
5714 2018-08-03 18:15:03 Consumption methods of cannabis include: 
1. FLOWER - dried cannabis flowers inhaled as smoke or vapor
2. EXTRACTS - cannabis concentrates like hash oil, wax & shatter
3. TOPICALS - cannabis-infused creams, lotions & balms  
4. EDIBLES - any food or beverage infused with cannabis

5723 2018-08-03 18:13:40 It appears you are eating a delicious Italian taco, especially if you have added pepperoncini and healthy shakes of oil and vinegar.

5726 2018-08-03 18:12:41 Is that attributable to a policy change? Or is that because the price of oil is going up?

5730 2018-08-03 18:12:20 It also regulates the price of marijuana...like how they regulate the price of oil and diamonds(limited release). Marijuana could be so much cheaper than $10 a gram and the 4000 plants they were growing doesn’t necessarily mean they have a value of $6.5 million dollars.

5742 2018-08-03 18:11:13 I feel very awkward walking into my dads business to say “hey...I’m the owner’s daughter” to receive a free service. This is what happens when my dad and brother are both off and I need my oil changed.
5743 2018-08-03 18:11:12 Yes, I have to: 
Adjusting for inflation, Standard Oil was worth $1 trillion over a century ago (and Rockefeller was worth 2.5x Bezos ) Further back, in the 1700s the South Sea company was worth perhaps $2 trillion, and the Dutch East India company significantly more than that.
5744 2018-08-03 18:11:01 was merely translating and conveying China's retaliation list, not making a judgment on it. Would also note that just weeks ago the administration was looking at a peace deal that would involve China buying more American oil and gas.  Now they're looking to block American LNG.

5766 2018-08-03 18:09:22 $200mil to $2tril isn’t a secret. You think oil gas coal n nuclear are the only power companies with lobbyists, and the only ones who donate to campaigns? It’s not a secret or a conspiracy. Millions of ppl w no thermodynamic knowledge are passionate about AGW. Plan successful.
5767 2018-08-03 18:09:21 All that’s missing is the oil
5768 2018-08-03 18:09:09 Peppermint oil is my go to for headaches . I get them really bad for weeks but when I put some peppermint oil on my head when I go to sleep I wake up pain free

5770 2018-08-03 18:09:02 Yep. It just makes no sense! I’m just wondering why the tech giants like amazon, Facebook, google, Microsoft cannot request 1 from the Chinese! Oh wait I remember why! Cause dufus dumbass dimwit has a tech meeting & is going after them while oil companies can rip apart the grand

5779 2018-08-03 18:08:29 I agree that we need to have a managed decline of oil and coal imports. But expanding NG would be a big mistake. 

We also don’t have a lot of NG here. More than 50% is imported from fracking in the US, and that will be almost 100% in the couple of years.
5780 2018-08-03 18:08:28 HOPE OIL! 
5781 2018-08-03 18:08:22 Shale oil reminds me of non fat yogurt..
5782 2018-08-03 18:08:14 It’s win-win for russia. It is ramping up LNG from current 10m tonnes so if it’s piped get closed it can just switch to lng. 

Beauty of lng is it makes gas a commodity as pipe gas is not. That means like oil you send your lng into the intl  market and it loses its identity
5783 2018-08-03 18:08:07 The decomposition point of Olive Oil is 220 degrees Celsius
5784 2018-08-03 18:08:05 The paris agreement had no teeth (ie almost useless) as well. If I remember right even at least one oil company supported it.

Well...
First, the Earth cooled. And then the Dinosaurs came! But, they got too big and fat, so they all died and turned into oil. And then the Arabs {and Persians} Came...

5793 2018-08-03 18:06:42 Creme creme eu não conheço, porque é mto difícil um que funcione mesmo. Mas o protetor Minesol Oil Control da Roc mudou minha vida, pele bem sequinha ao longo do dia
5794 2018-08-03 18:06:32 Elle s’imposera un jour ? Mais c’est déjà le cas : le peak oil conventionnel est passé depuis 2006. Depuis les crises s’enchaînent de plus en plus rapidement !
5795 2018-08-03 18:06:24 Collapsed sorry that's not what I see at the pumps. Over 60/70 yrs of oil how many times has the price collapsed. Plus more oil at the west coast, so explain why! Oil companies still pumping billions into new fields. How many new fields were discovered funny after indi 1
5796 2018-08-03 18:06:23 Yeah, from what I understand, the current administration in Ecuador is much worse than its predecessor. But both were pretty reliant on oil revenues for social spending. Dunno about Evo.
5797 2018-08-03 18:06:14 Have you tried Essential Oils?  Or even CBD oil?  Both that helped my anxiety tremendously!
5798 2018-08-03 18:06:08 I got halfway dressed for the first time in a while to run errands and so far I’ve gotten a discount on my oil change and a free icee.
5799 2018-08-03 18:06:06 I use CBD oil for my anxiety so if I can be a hand, let me know! I’m also a journo looking for work! X

5802 2018-08-03 18:05:55 When you look at the info abt the PNP oil hedge you realize it was one big scam. How can ja import 24 Mill barrel of oil and the PNP hedge on 8 mil? Lol. So 16 mill barrel we still pay full price for when the hedge was adv as been for everything. 3card trick
5803 2018-08-03 18:05:49 I just heard a couple agree they were going to have sloppy joe’s tonight & go over whether they had all the ingredients. Truffle oil was in the list.
5804 2018-08-03 18:05:46 Hey, now.  It’s Miracle Whip or nothing.  Or maybe, possibly honey mustard.  Okay, wasabi mayo, but on very, very rare occasions, and it has to be the olive oil kind.
5805 2018-08-03 18:05:20 Which is one of the reasons that I have for the last 15-20 years read aot of foreign media. Not just Australian and British but also middle eastern.  It all started with the oil rig in Atlantic with the pirates. US media didn’t have a lot of info, foreign did.

5809 2018-08-03 18:04:43 Hmm, well good luck with that. A lil oil leak isn't the end of the world, but also depends on where it's leaking. 

Professionals are there for a reason.

5830 2018-08-03 18:01:41 The banks routinely get fined for breaking fin laws/regs and pay the fine (JPM HSBC) PFE paid a massive $2.3B fine in 09 for off label marketing.  BP has an epic oil spill and only paid a % penalties against it. My point is corps consider it fact of life/part of business.

5836 2018-08-03 18:01:01 They'll still need to explain the fraudulent accounting and false and misleading statements in filings, but some oil would help.

Not that I expect any, but that should be the longs focus.  Company is bending you over not shorts or the FT.
5837 2018-08-03 18:00:53 I got into a small accident a while ago, so Im assuming that was the start of all my problems under the hood. Been going to the mechanic to get a couple parts changed , had some oil running through places it shouldnt, a/c needed repair, etc.

5844 2018-08-03 17:59:58 While in the US agriculture is threatened- Russia’s agriculture exports have surged by almost a third in the first five months of the year. Food is Russia’s second biggest export after oil and gas, helping to diversify the economy away from energy. RT.
5845 2018-08-03 17:59:52 I am quite aware of our energy gap’s, i’ve worked in the automotive industry for almost 40 years. But suing the oil industry is not the answer to the problem. and the mere suggestion of it is totally asinine! Good day.

5863 2018-08-03 17:57:41 Yeah. I think that’s true at least rhetorically (I don’t know all the actual facts), but in Bolivia and I thought Ecuador they’ve torn up indigenous lands for mining and oil etc

5869 2018-08-03 17:56:15 When you calculate the financial benefits taking in 20,000 refugees is a small price to pay for a healthy arms industry and cheap oil.

5891 2018-08-03 17:53:12 We know api correlates to lto as lto is (LIGHT tight oil). Look how it converges on the API chart at 35-40. Clearly indicating commingling at battery. If commingled at battery DI can’t give you data no matter what you pay. It’s sold by lease. Vert rig uptic just adds to my point.

5922 2018-08-03 17:48:59 Pdp is a thieving party. They re not wat we need. Definitely not what Nigeria needs.
Ask yourself, how was their 16years rule?
What did Nig benefit from 16years rule?
B4 you say there was no hunger in the country, remember there was unemployment, remember d price of oil was high.

5925 2018-08-03 17:48:40 The additives cost me less than $10 every oil change. I get the same gas mileage with any gas station. It's just gasoline, maybe if you have an older car or sports car I'd understand but otherwise it's all the same

5928 2018-08-03 17:48:22 I wish gas was free actually I wish we finally broke free from big oil’s stronghold and converted to clean energy actually i wish we lived in a socialist utopia
5929 2018-08-03 17:48:17 By mct oil you mean semen, right?
5930 2018-08-03 17:48:13 No ... just NO. Leave the damn emu alone! Their "oil" (eww gross) doesn't do a damn thing for your skin that you couldn't achieve with any other plant based oil or no oil at all ...

5932 2018-08-03 17:48:08 But oil change is 5K workmanship standard service charge
5933 2018-08-03 17:48:04 The dealer want 1200 dollars just to change the oil
5934 2018-08-03 17:47:52 Coconut oil leaked all over my red vans, hows ur day???
5935 2018-08-03 17:47:47 One told me cannabis oil healed rheumatism by removing the body's immune response. Well, that would reverse my immunotherapy and kill me. I'm sticking to science!
5936 2018-08-03 17:47:36 Y’all can make fun of oily skin all you want, but just remembered the excess oil on the skin really helps keep moisture in which means younger looking skin, and a lesser chance of getting wrinkles. Yeet
5937 2018-08-03 17:47:21 The RNC doesn't need them anymore. They have Putin. And the Koch brothers will be back because no way the Dems suddenly go anti-science on climate change and alternative energy. They've got no one else to help them prop up oil prices. And Putin probably knows this.
5938 2018-08-03 17:47:10 Who uses the oil that comes with Indomie Onions? I don't because of a possible mess to my hands so I just throw it away.

5941 2018-08-03 17:46:45 Red wine cauliflower coconut oil omelettes?
5942 2018-08-03 17:46:44 Not really. Our military contracting sector will collapse if they stop buying arms. They repeatedly bailed us out by buying our debt and by keeping price/supply of oil stable. Saudi citizens spend billions of dollars each year in US, on education, real estate, retail.

5951 2018-08-03 17:44:40 Cannabis Oil/ Velcade! X
5952 2018-08-03 17:44:25 They’re amazing on the bbq, no pre cooking of the asparagus, just a drizzle of oil and straight on. I’d highly recommend them 
5953 2018-08-03 17:44:20 I do. I tried to introduce a colleague of mine, an all-round Yank, to the flavor of some decent Bertolli, which he instantly liked. He asked me which one he should buy in the supermarket, but when I pointed it out to him, he was aghast: that's expensive! WAY more than canola oil!
5954 2018-08-03 17:44:18 Lmfaooo im G’ing it. That gif was just too priceless  Tea tree oil, castor oil, and shea moisture beard kit are things I’ve used
5955 2018-08-03 17:43:49 Drinkin coconut oil is still ok with me, but oil pulling with coconut oil (swishing the oil in your mouth) is just plain 
5956 2018-08-03 17:43:48 so happy I got MTC oil today
5957 2018-08-03 17:43:39 Show me another ally getting that much money and military tech.  Even one.  Without paying through the oil pump for it.

Show me another ally selling our military tech to China and Russia.

Show me another ally we invaded a country for.

I'll wait.
5958 2018-08-03 17:43:35 You mean the ones who helped build this country, paid taxes for the past 40 plus years so the Idiots can piss it all away?

5961 2018-08-03 17:43:27 My youngest has been cutting the plastic from our 6 packs and refuses to have anything with palm oil. If we do she calls us out by yelling “you like to support monkey killers!?”

5963 2018-08-03 17:43:16 i love eating an all natural food with no oil just to have an entire pack of oreos for dessert
5964 2018-08-03 17:43:14 I love the feeling of satisfying, completely plant-based meals & snacks more than anything else. Like, I just ate a whole baked sweet potato w/ garlic, home-grown basil, & olive oil...I was still hungry so I proceeded to chop a LONG ASS CUCUMBER. I'm full now, y'all. 
5965 2018-08-03 17:43:08 I got an oil diffuser and I’m already in love
5966 2018-08-03 17:42:57 What about CBD Oil?

I am off Tramadol since starting it
5967 2018-08-03 17:42:46 I’ve done nothing today but get an oil change and eat lunch, still have laundry and packing to do, but I feel like I need a nap.
5968 2018-08-03 17:42:30 State-owned oil refinery, Petrojam, is seeking to reassure Jamaicans that the increase in fuel prices is unrelated to matters in Jamaica. #NCUFM #Newsin91secs
5969 2018-08-03 17:42:20 What about the BP disaster? What about the Exxon disaster? No one cares that the oil and gas companies still don't have a way to prevent the next ones and the government isn't even researching what to do the next time!  Out of sight - out of mind (and wallet)!
5970 2018-08-03 17:42:14 Why not #LCHF and do some mindful movement? That usually works. If not just rub coconut oil on it. #Pioppi

5976 2018-08-03 17:41:04 ...but that wouldn't please Putin. He wants the West destroyed because it doesn't think he should go around invading and murdering and have control of oil. 
Rich folks are to blame for most of this. We should be clean energy pioneers not beholden to oil fools.
5977 2018-08-03 17:40:53 I think people are using the climate hoax debate to get off topic about the real issue. If we want to be closer to a world utopia, we need to leave oil behind and get into solar panels and wind turbines. Cause if it ain't sunny, it's probably windy.
5978 2018-08-03 17:40:50 Guess who started ICE ?  I know because they were our competition at NYMEX years ago in the oil futures ..

5984 2018-08-03 17:40:20 Buddy just cover your short @Tesla position, time to throw in the towel and get back to drilling for oil
5985 2018-08-03 17:40:18 because if it was legal, they couldn't "control" it therefor they wouldn't make much profit - If oil grew on plants it's same scenario, Only they would be allowed to grow it
5986 2018-08-03 17:40:18 Kalo aku diolesin minyak kelapa (vco)  sama olive oil trus makan ikan gabus buat pertumbuhan dagingnya
5987 2018-08-03 17:40:18 Even without making the shift from petrol there's tons of green process options that should be made mandatory through legislation. Drag every single oil and gas lobbyist behind a car until they're shredded to coleslaw imo

5994 2018-08-03 17:39:16 I'm too poor to afford olive oil but good to know
5995 2018-08-03 17:39:16 I hate paying for an oil change.
5996 2018-08-03 17:39:12 Just proves my theory we need huge water pipelines across the globe instead of oil pipelines.
5997 2018-08-03 17:39:01 아아니 넘 단호했네 그냥 전체적이면서도 세부적인 그런 느낌이
5998 2018-08-03 17:39:00 Time for clean, renewable, sustainable energy. Leave the oil in the ground.
5999 2018-08-03 17:38:52 Which only goes to show we're not native to this planet, or we'd be able to subsist on oil.

6004 2018-08-03 17:38:26 So if making TV is like drilling for oil, does that mean that what Netflix does is like fracking? #TCA18
6005 2018-08-03 17:38:26 If in America you see “packed in Italy” versus “from Italy” on your oil you know its low quality.
6006 2018-08-03 17:38:13 Stop buying now oil from them
6007 2018-08-03 17:38:01 I don't like to predict recession, but the global economy is likely to experience a significant slowdown before the end of 2019, and the slowdown may be necessary to relieve upward pressure on oil prices.
6008 2018-08-03 17:37:59 Are you actually for real??? Are you trying so say that it is legal to poor Oil on the ground..... you must be crazy. EHO would have a field day.

6012 2018-08-03 17:37:29 Covering all the bases now, coach. Love it! Thoughts on coconut oil? Any take on the smoke point of various oils compared to their nutritional value?

6025 2018-08-03 17:35:15 In 1988, Mexico and Venezuela renew the San Jose Pact agreeing to supply oil to several Central American and Caribbean countries except Haiti that does not have a democratic regime.
6026 2018-08-03 17:35:15 At present, geoengineering offers no solutions, only an opportunity delay. We could "green" the Sahara (taking carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in trees) but even tgat only delays rising carbon if we don't also stop burning oil, gas, and coal.

6062 2018-08-03 17:30:12 Landgraf is talking about FX shows past and present and about which shows were expected to be hits. "One of the things I love about what we do is that it's drilling like oil. I'm constantly surprised by where we find it & who we find it with. It's about growing it from ground up"
6063 2018-08-03 17:30:11 So yesterday I bought CBD oil from a witch. I may have gone full toronto.
6064 2018-08-03 17:29:51 You're kidding right?  Venezuela still has oil, but it isn't enough to save a socialist government.
6065 2018-08-03 17:29:42 I been pushing this oil change off for a minute.. lmfao’ but today.. today’s the day! 
6066 2018-08-03 17:29:32 This feels like the plea of a snake oil salesman or evangelical fraud hold up the crowd by its ankles and shaking until the coins fall out.
6067 2018-08-03 17:29:30 It is! I assume, since you live in Chicago like me, that you've had Jeni's sweet corn ice cream? I'd recommend, if you ever are in Portland, you try  the olive oil ice cream at Salt and Straw, if you haven't already.

6072 2018-08-03 17:28:52 So I just accidentally spilled roasted garlic oil on part of my phone.  Everything still works, but it smells like roasted garlic now. Idk what to do, do I try to get the smell off and risk damage to the phone or deal with garlic all day. Either way I could really do without this
6073 2018-08-03 17:28:37 เฟล

6077 2018-08-03 17:28:22 Crude oil, priced in E.M. currencies, is near an all-time high !!
6078 2018-08-03 17:28:13 nice job, Joe, parroting what the oil companies train people to do... phrases like "urgent issue that faces all of humanity" and "science is clear and overwhelming" are same as Galileo was up against when the SETTLED science said the earth is FLAT

Fires that are slightly droopy, Chicken Gravy, cheese curds.

The international food scene tries to elevate poutine to a high art, but this is a mistake.
It's already flying above nearly all foods. Adding truffle oil diminishes a poutine.
Add hotdogs.

6108 2018-08-03 17:25:05 #Trumpflation 4 Dummies

Domestic prices up bc of higher raw material costs (trump tariffs), tight job market (trump tax scam), exports down (retaliation to trump tariffs), transportation (trump destabilization of mid east oil market).

Import prices up (trump tariffs).

6109 2018-08-03 17:25:04 Baker Hughes Rig Count: Canada 0 at 223 rigs
Canada Rig Count is unchanged from last week at 223 rigs, with oil rigs down 2 to 152 and gas rigs up 2 to 71.
Canada Rig Count is up 6 rigs from last year's count of 217, with oil rigs up 28 and gas rigs down 22. #oott #crudeoil
6110 2018-08-03 17:24:59 Why you think that a permanent 2-4 fold increase in the price of oil, the basis of our economy, would have no lasting effects on growth? Stagflation in the 1970s, and monetary policy of the 1980s, also hammered growth. yet growth 1973-1993 was similar to 1955-1975.

6113 2018-08-03 17:24:46 Yo just yesterday my dad didnt let me do a oil change without him, I've been doing them bms since I got the car.
6114 2018-08-03 17:24:44 Considering Venezuela has vast income on OIL!!! That’s CORRUPTION OF THE FIRST ORDER DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM UNCHECKED
6115 2018-08-03 17:24:28 I think depends on the kind of parsley.. I put a cup basil, half a cup parsley, garlic, olive oil, parmesans grated, pine nuts and a small spoon of honey! Do you use something else?
6116 2018-08-03 17:24:23 .@tferriss Do, or do not take 2-3X recommended dose of Oregano Oil? If not, what part of you burns?
6117 2018-08-03 17:24:22 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever. Psa 23:5-6
6118 2018-08-03 17:24:22 If the PNP purchased options for the purchase of oil, they would have not exercised the options given the spot price was below the market price of oil. Does it mean therefore the hedging strategy used was futures contracts .
6119 2018-08-03 17:24:19 You need to get back down here.

Took one of my former drilling engineers and his stepson offshore for their first time Wednesday: Eight big Red Snapper, two Mahi... and a 65 inch Wahoo.
6120 2018-08-03 17:24:07 I rubbed coconut oil on this child's skin for the first time and his skin breaks out immediately.

6122 2018-08-03 17:24:02 The difference here is.....she did NOT use anything. At all. This whole holistic thing is a scam. She did not have dandelion tea or oregano oil until the night before he died. Her neighbor gave it to her and also told her to call the ambulance. She refused.
6123 2018-08-03 17:23:38 ...does he know the carbon footprint (in oil terms) of the so much touted renewables? Unfortunately, I would be debating against ignominy, so i just shake my head waka comot. 

Truth is that the whole world is hooked on oil steroids for a long more time to come. Forget renewables
6124 2018-08-03 17:23:36 Nothing a bottle of coconut oil,my hands and your naked self can't fix.
6125 2018-08-03 17:23:34 Definitely taking my laptop cause ain’t no telling how long Calverts gone be. An oil change take all of twenty minutes. Ion wanna hear about shit else. Just change the oil and top off my fluids.DASSIT
6126 2018-08-03 17:23:32 Seasonal and skilled tradesmen are always in high demand during summer.  We are projected to grow at 1.9 next year down from this year. Even at current high oil rates, our loonie hasn't recovered. To me this indicates all is not well.
6127 2018-08-03 17:23:32 I do the oil and it's been very helpful. The looks you get from people when  you tell them you use cannabis and the  explain "it's only CBD" lol

6133 2018-08-03 17:22:43 Taxpayers are the reluctant “investors” and these investments lose.  “Block” Oil from hostile countries?  The US imported from over 60 countries last year.
6134 2018-08-03 17:22:38 And you still havent backed up your claim of the “mess” Manitoba was in. We have a stable and growing economy.   And not investing in more oil is not evidence to the show a “mess”
6135 2018-08-03 17:22:20 Prices on domestic goods up because of higher raw material costs (trump tariffs), tight job market (trump tax scam), loss of overseas business (retaliation to trump tariffs), transportation (trump destabilization of mid east oil market).

Prices on imports up (trump tariffs).

6141 2018-08-03 17:21:56 First of all, almost no one is drilling new conventional oil wells in Texas that amount to any meaningful volume. Second, the data shown thru DI is well-based (I pay extra for TX Allocated Production data).
6142 2018-08-03 17:21:55 To uncover the imprint the oil tube must be dismantled, such a flaw, bringing in a car that has the S/N imprint hidden, dismanling it every 3 years should be borne by the dealer who brought the car into the state with no consideration to the law.

6194 2018-08-03 17:16:48 "really promising" is the same thing that snake oil salesmen said, "or else they wouldn't engage in selling them."

Instead of cutting the process short, selling false hope in some cases, the drugs should be proved safe and effective.

6201 2018-08-03 17:16:06 Oil is not expected to return to the levels it was in the past so diversifying your economy may be your only option regardless of who is in government, Premier Notley does not rule the world there are whole countries moving to environmentally friendly products
6202 2018-08-03 17:15:56 They offered to help rebuild syria a while ago. Probably in exchange for something like they do in africa. They probably want oil. Since they are the number one consumer now. And US also wants that oil and pipeline control.

6209 2018-08-03 17:15:04 And API correlates exactly how to tight vs conventional? Oil gravity is a pressure-temperature function. It is true that tight oil TENDS to be higher API but I will take production data every day over API which is at best an n-th derivative indicator of tight oil.

6214 2018-08-03 17:14:36 I wonder what Hedge did the former administration used 
was it " Options or Futures".
If it was futures it meant that we could have been buying oil at a price higher that the spot price at the point of expiration of the futures contract. Ie losing lots of money
6215 2018-08-03 17:14:35 Phillips is feeding all of Canada BS. We did not lead the country because of diversification or innovation. Oil has gone from $42 to $70 in the last two years.  That’s why % growth is relatively good. The economy still sucks but it’s better than it was.
6216 2018-08-03 17:14:18 We'd planned to use this to learn how to work on the oily bits but too little money and too many kids mean it's never got much further than oil and plug changes. I normally manage that alright but this feels carb or timing-related and I've gone as far as I dare down that avenue.

6221 2018-08-03 17:13:43 The only thing that halted its prior uptrend was when oil prices collapsed and undercut the fracking boom temporarily.
6222 2018-08-03 17:13:41 The women who work on oil rigs, etc. are in  Canada, and we also don’t care which race we hire, either!! Sex orientation doesn’t matter, if the person can do the job- that’s what we look for!!!

You’ve got only men on your oil platforms, because that’s all you hire in your
6223 2018-08-03 17:13:20 $54 for an oil change 
6224 2018-08-03 17:13:14 I think any drop in Oil bid price next week is a Head Fake. The move back to $80 will be whipsawed IF the tension between Yemen|Israel and Saudi|Yemen and Iran|USA cause threats or worse in Red Sea & Hormuz. One interruption can spike futures in 1 min. Think 18 months ahead.
6225 2018-08-03 17:13:13 If you own a black business please only hire blacks ! We gotta stick together  we’re the only race that doesn’t have ownership of nothing (water,electricity,gas,oil,OUR KIDS) we just gotta do better forreal.

6235 2018-08-03 17:10:57 If you use Shea moisture or Cantu products in Ocean curly hair, it will ruin it. I promise you, this is why I write on the care card not to use oil based / or black hair products. Ocean curly is NOT black hair, please do not use products that aren’t recommended.

6239 2018-08-03 17:10:09 Short answer is yes, the hedge (for 1/3 of oil import bill, or $3.3 billion. So even if the hedge was triggered Jamaica would only have 33% coverage) amount seems to have been redirected to social services such as PATH etc. I wasn’t in support of the hedge initially.

6269 2018-08-03 17:06:33 Yes she is being outfitted for the oil extraction from the Manolis L. Our company, DF Barnes is fabricating and installing the new additions and preparing her for the operation.
6270 2018-08-03 17:06:20 Kid down the block had a Subaru 360 Van (the original Clown Car) imported to USA before they decided that was illegal - that was a hoot to keep running...  Especially when the Auto Oil Injection  on the 2-stroke quit "Hey, it's not smoking today - Why??"  Caught it in time.
6271 2018-08-03 17:06:20 OIL priced in dollars. Debt is price in Dollars. Interest is priced in Dollars.
If Gold is leased to earn interest what if gold drops in value (russia shipwreck 200Tons) then debts in gold get more expensive to repay for borrower, vise versa

6332 2018-08-03 17:00:46 Are you suggesting that the increase of the $6.4 billion collected in 2017- 2018 will be used in total for social engineering? I am pretty sure your message of prosperity was not based on the oil hedge fund been used for social engineering. Try again mate!
6333 2018-08-03 17:00:44 There was no oil in 1707.  You were on your knees
6334 2018-08-03 17:00:35 Great response. The hysteria over China taking over the world is ludicrous. There entire economy is derivative based on the US. Yuan Oil futures contract is a gimmick as is just about every other "threat" they make.
6335 2018-08-03 17:00:25 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
6336 2018-08-03 17:00:24 I wished the Federal Gov't would have stood it's ground on #climatechange - But there seems to be a large cohort of Deniers in this country, with a population addicted to consumption, consumerism and oil/gas - and not wanting to change or bare any additional costs to change!

6339 2018-08-03 17:00:14 The curse of oil? Perhaps you don’t try hard if you have infinite wealth
6340 2018-08-03 17:00:10 I was literally so excited for today I finally got to get my nails done and was going to get my nose pierced and get an oil change and be thriving... yeah I got rear ended and now it hurts to move so 
6341 2018-08-03 17:00:02 ..magnificent man oil!
6342 2018-08-03 16:59:37 I wonder if this is an early sign of saudi well tapping out, or just some logistics snafu
6343 2018-08-03 16:59:34 Crude oil futures for Sept/Oct lower again Friday afternoon $WTI_Crude -0.86% at $68.37, $NBZ_F -0.30% at $73.23, $USO -0.97% at $14.22 for 08/03/18.
6344 2018-08-03 16:59:24 Same opportunities? Oil export for MB is 1% of Canada’s total. SK is 12%. AB is 79%. BC is 2%.
What are these “same opportunities?”
6345 2018-08-03 16:59:19 I can't believe we are down to this now

6348 2018-08-03 16:58:55 They know not- is all we can pray to God almighty! B’Desh will be annoyed & worst is giving access or citizenship to all except Muslims 6 yrs amdt. We get bulk of our oil from W Asia & soon we will have our countrymen back in droves for running more dhokla, err Pakoras centres
6349 2018-08-03 16:58:53 Don’t wait too long between oil changes, kids. The nice man at Penzoil will serve you disappointed dad realness. 
6350 2018-08-03 16:58:46 I don't recall the promises of dirty air, unsafe drinking water, unsafe work sites, decreased actual income due to increased healthcare premiums and tariff costs, abusing people at the border, traumatizing babies, trophy hunting, risking pristine wilderness for big oil...
6351 2018-08-03 16:58:40 Get a humidifier, get ocean nasal spray, use oil of olay. My mom deals with the same thing.
6352 2018-08-03 16:58:32 I am OBSESSED with essential oils. It breaks my heart that I can’t diffuse just any essential oil bc most of the ones I like are harmful to my fur babies, but I can live with it.
6353 2018-08-03 16:58:23 Wow! What the collection you have got there! We are having some serious PT oil envy over here! Thank you for sharing the love with us!
6354 2018-08-03 16:58:14 Motorcycle oil ?! That sounds brutal 
6355 2018-08-03 16:58:06 Buy British where you can - great UK cheese & wine, Rapeseed oil & British built cars amongst other great products.

6357 2018-08-03 16:57:52 Why retag me? XD
6358 2018-08-03 16:57:46 1. Break down raw castor beans in lye.
2. Pulverize the shell-less seeds.
3. Soak in acetone to remove oil.
4. Remove acetone and dry powder.
5. Something probably fairly lethal.
6359 2018-08-03 16:57:39 Did the UN and U.K. stipulate that Jews shouldn’t be harmed too? Arabs hardly complied with that! Or did the British concede to turn a blind eye because they didn’t want to upset the Arabs because they needed their oil?

6362 2018-08-03 16:56:58 balance of payment with Iran....and oil market
6363 2018-08-03 16:56:56 You are a joke. The biggest thief is on top. Biya personally take oil revenues and transfer that money on foreign bank accounts. Even his ministers are informed and don't know where he put it.
6364 2018-08-03 16:56:48 The symmetary with AUD now testing 2014-2015 support line is awesome. So many parallels with the commodities / China / Eurodollar crisis back then. 

But I still think we need to see oil lower before $ can really get going (and the cycle begins). Everyone is so underprepared.

6366 2018-08-03 16:56:35 Vat Of Fermenting Nercomanic Seeping
Ingredients: One innate spellcaster, mixture of paralytic and anticoagulant toxins to keep the body still and slowly seep blood, oil base to have body float. Makes effectively 20 potions. Effect: Increase necromancy and negative energy effects
6367 2018-08-03 16:56:34 Mr. Bennett probably just burnt it in an old oil barrel at the back of the Take Hart studio with the rest of the rejects. Kids TV show reality is harsh. So sorry. You're doing okay for yourself without Tony's approval anyway. Go you!
6368 2018-08-03 16:56:31 Brougght it away new clutch plates (carbon fiber) with and for the slipperclutch,  fresh oil, new brakepump the corsaco from Brembo and set tyres sc1/sc2  and some small stuff  stompgrips and bubblescreen so it should bena fresh one  . Next bike will be the bmw 1000rr
6369 2018-08-03 16:56:22 Erdogan and son don't like to be poor. With big palace paid for by the people, and son trading oil with IS to enrich the family. The Gulen thing is just to steer the people's attention and steal the companies of those said to be linked to Gulen. All good to destroy the economy.

6372 2018-08-03 16:55:40 Same here, not getting an alert. 1.5 yrs Trump at best is POTUS to base only. Under 45 admin hate crimes & harassment are up, hate grps are emboldened (both sides). Rights eroded. Consumer protection roll backs. Oil drilling on fed lands. Signs  of anthr recession. Too early? 
6373 2018-08-03 16:55:38 How can Dawn dish soap get oil off of ducks but not Vaseline out of my hair when I was 13 
6374 2018-08-03 16:55:15 Trump said he would drain the swamp. Then he turned it into a corrupt cesspool. And he's not hiding it! The latest reduction of automobile emission standards shamelessly put countless millions into the pockets of the oil industry right in front of your very eyes!
Wake up America!
6375 2018-08-03 16:55:13 Just look at how oil is overflowing on your head
6376 2018-08-03 16:55:03 I’m not buying the Snake Oil that @KrisKobach1787 is selling. I’m a Republican, but not one of the “tin hat” nitwit brigade like Kobach/Trump. They create a problem, whip up controversy and division, then try to solve the problem. Too smart for that 
6377 2018-08-03 16:54:55 Ill try the olive oil thanks!
6378 2018-08-03 16:54:54 「お利口さん」でちょっと我慢ならなくて野次飛ばしたよね

Standard Oil...
Saudi Aramco...
PetroChina...

Some that come to mind.
6380 2018-08-03 16:54:52 Yes I am okay. I check Stats Canada for my info. Low unemployment, 19 of 20 key sectors moving upward, 2.5% increase in the oil and gas sector alone in May, our GDP is currently at 1.635 trillion up over 100 billion from this time last year. Those are the hard facts.
6381 2018-08-03 16:54:33 Told my aunt to get cannabis oil for my grandma to help with the Alzheimer’s but it’ll open her appetite too. 

She go make me know say Mama cya get no appetizer because she wuda nyam everything up to the neighbour

6383 2018-08-03 16:54:02 coconut oil fixes everything
6384 2018-08-03 16:53:56 coconut oil is magic. use it everywhere on everything - your body will love you 
6385 2018-08-03 16:53:54 He’s got to make sure big oil can go back to making as much money as possible Planet be damned

6389 2018-08-03 16:53:31 @Assimalhakeem Assalamu ‘alaykum Shaykh, can oils such as mustard oil, castor oil etc be used in ihram?
6390 2018-08-03 16:53:31 More like big oil, military industrial complex, and fundies

6395 2018-08-03 16:52:50 And chalk - it dries up oil, can cover a stain on a white dress long enough for pictures, etc.
6396 2018-08-03 16:52:47 Guy told me he’s heard my name and story’s everywhere he’s worked in the oil field. Got the big head until he told me what kinda story’s. So glad that’s not me anymore.

6400 2018-08-03 16:52:22 It would be better if you could just grow your own. This place I spent around 200$’s. The vape cartridge tasted like your smoking plastic and a poisonous cough. Their pills or indica THC oil both were a waste. Until Florida gets the marijuana growing for us poor people no $$$.

Sometimes get called Oil aswell so that's always good.
6408 2018-08-03 16:51:36 You mean the US has already succeeded in preventing Russian oil/gas deals with other countries? Or that little thing's just slipped your mind? And off course Russia doesn't export sex. Some Russian people do though. Can't blame them! Russia is a free country!

6424 2018-08-03 16:50:23 Obama is who said as much, that being energy independent is key to getting away from foreign oil dependence. Hence, a push for green alternatives, higher fuel efficiency.

It’s the idiot GOP oil industry & lobbyists who fought that, afraid profits would dry up. Tough shit. Evolve

6429 2018-08-03 16:50:01 Not only are oil prices rising...but he screws w/Iran (they’ll go up again). Now he rolls back fuel efficiency rules...resulting in us Consumers paying more in gas prices.

6433 2018-08-03 16:49:28 Love this. My grandfather was assigned to the British 8th Army to keep the Nazis out of Egypt's oil fields and the Suez Canal. He fought at the Battle of El-Alamein, a critical turning point in WWII.

6435 2018-08-03 16:49:24 I was talking oil
6436 2018-08-03 16:49:21 I changed the oil, replaced the brakes, flushed the coolant, cleaned the air filter, and got a fuel system service on my car within the last two days. The bitch better give me som good mpg or she’s going into a ditch at 85
6437 2018-08-03 16:49:16 I know. It’s great as there is no ramping meaning reduced volatility. As long as oil prices remain high this will easily trade £10 plus when in production early 2020 assuming no dilution

6439 2018-08-03 16:49:12 Salmon oil will help, it’s rich in omega-3s that help coats.. most pet stores will have a lotion style bottle of salmon oil that you can rub into the hot spots. Couple that with a hypoallergenic shampoo that uses oatmeal and you should see her symptoms diminish!

6452 2018-08-03 16:47:59 3.  Not the best article to toot your own horn with.  Only jobs it even mentions creating is factory and coal/oil producing jobs.  Not good for our future. Americans deserve better.

No one is saying genicide horrors are forgivable. But this middle east ISIS disaster bloomed thanks to Bush and our endless exploiting middle east nations, propping up dictators that are oil corporate friendly puppets
6458 2018-08-03 16:46:59 From these numbers Lukoil looks as a first rate by: In the healthy oil market, in a stable economy with permanent political situation with no risk of the president going to court. Lets hope you get your act better together.

6464 2018-08-03 16:46:07 @BSYBJP @AnanthKumar_BJP The limited use of oil products is also a co-ordinator for the country's development. Our country's money going abroad for tax ace.1 good thing from the population but 10 worse. Some rich people want to be "the poor people like that" Cheating is happening
6465 2018-08-03 16:45:54 Went to get an oil change and some douche pulled in next to me and tried to say he was there first. The mechanic YELLED AT THIS GUY because he knew I was there first
6466 2018-08-03 16:45:51 色塗ってるとどんどん正気じゃなくなってメメントモリしてしまう最近の状況…いかがかとおもう とりあえず寝るけど
6467 2018-08-03 16:45:46 Stir together 2 1/2 pints grapes with 1/3 cup bisque. Mix in Olive Oil. Allow to harden Serve with love.
6468 2018-08-03 16:45:42    In my opinion, it will be the Tariffs, and that drag on the economy that  will bring #ManBaby down. Inflation will spiral, interests rate will go up. Costs of good will rise, food prices up. Oil/Gas price will spiral.
6469 2018-08-03 16:45:42 We would suggest switching barbers, my liege. Beard Oil is the bearded nectar of the gods. End of discussion
6470 2018-08-03 16:45:36 This has nothing to do with 2016. This has to do with the pack of charlatans selling snake oil today, kid.
6471 2018-08-03 16:45:33 My favs oil painting bc it's super forgiving lol
6472 2018-08-03 16:45:28 Lesson learned today. 
Don't schedule an oil change for 11am. If the mechanic is running a little late. He stops for lunch at 12 sharp. Then you have to wait for him to return at 1pm.
6473 2018-08-03 16:45:14 Try olive oil 
6474 2018-08-03 16:45:09 Yikes.. I was using tea tree oil earlier this month

6477 2018-08-03 16:44:52 Had the reflexologist use some of the CBD Oil in with the massaging of my feet this morning.  My entire body was relaxed within minutes.  #relaxingwithcbd
6478 2018-08-03 16:44:50 I had a dream that I was driving my Jeep with no gas, no engine oil, no brakes and some baby ass make shift steering wheel. Shit was wild
6479 2018-08-03 16:44:36  Don't think that IRAN will let them live in peace, we all knows what d YEMEN REBELS r doing near d YEMEN - KSA border. Recently ship carrying oil of KSA was hit by missile in RED SEA which prompted KSA to stop using d route.. 
6480 2018-08-03 16:44:36 How much AK oil goes to China? As of today, none. They just announced NO imports from the US, thanks to Republican trade war with the world. Still mum?
6481 2018-08-03 16:44:28 Oh I cook asparagus in olive oil with some salt and pepper and maybe a touch of ground mustard or cayenne. In the oven is good but my favorite is when @TheFattyScott cooks it in the smoker.
6482 2018-08-03 16:44:27 If an oil contractor goes on native land and rapes and kills a woman the Indian law has no authority over him, even with evidence. #damnshame 
Its like fucking really???the Indians haven't been mistreated enough??? Is there anyone who says that???
6483 2018-08-03 16:44:13 Hate auto repair shops with a damn passion. Like DAMN BOBBY Im just tryna get my oil changed not spend $300 .

6486 2018-08-03 16:43:50 So I’m getting my oil changed for my Camaro and my grandpa calls me and tells me to go look at Corvettes while I’m waiting and tell him which one I liked bc he needs a cool car for me to drive him around in & that there might be a surprise when I get home 
6487 2018-08-03 16:43:46 Agreed! I think CBD oil would be a good alternative to look into as well.
6488 2018-08-03 16:43:44 Exp-hairimenting again.  Today’s question: if I’m allergic to a food and that oil is used in hair products, will I be allergic to the hair product?
6489 2018-08-03 16:43:39 Washing your face can actually dry your skin out causing it to produce excess oil that clogs your pores! Make sure you use a good moisturizer afterwards! -a beauty school drop out
6490 2018-08-03 16:43:19 Don't get your hopes up that the Venezuelan regime [or people] are admitting that socialism has failed. They just think it needs to be tweaked some more. Maduro's talking about increasing oil production - not embracing economic freedom. They blame outsiders - and capitalism.
6491 2018-08-03 16:43:12 Apparently the headlights this oil change place sells are made by unicorns from gold and diamonds.

6500 2018-08-03 16:42:20 Yes the oil is amazing
6501 2018-08-03 16:42:20 Yes. I agree @budiman178889 

A moral case could be made but 
1) The USA is 1000s of miles from the ME, so I’m not sure what we’d need to defend
2) Trade routes are important but that’s why we’ve got a navy 
3) We make oil. We’re fine. 

Maybe livemon is right but let’s make sure
6502 2018-08-03 16:42:14 This kind of skill is goals for me.  It looks like a fricking oil painting and those rocks 
6503 2018-08-03 16:42:07 #RJRHotline The narrative that the SCT on oil imports was for an oil hedge only is false. Only 50% of the funds were used on the hedge.
6504 2018-08-03 16:42:06 In elementary we went to the damn Oil Ranch every damn year.

6512 2018-08-03 16:41:28 virgin Olive oil dipped in garlic and chili flakes is great sauce substitute for alfredo sauce which is very heavy and high in calories .. added to this some spinach and mushroom and garnished with parmesan will be perfect italian pasta dish #italian #cuisine
6513 2018-08-03 16:41:15 A few months this back I was at an industry meeting listening to discussions on Oil and New Home Construction. 

Someone alluded to the market sentiment being full of hopuim. 

First thing that came to mind was crypto. Talked to him later and he is in BTC. Old guy too...

6516 2018-08-03 16:41:02 I know in Mass there is a ton of fees and taxes, on top of ridiculous parking rates and tolls. Plus there's gas tax, tire tax, oil tax, etc. They know most people need their cars. Can't wait for the carbon tax.
6517 2018-08-03 16:40:55 Gotcha!
6518 2018-08-03 16:40:44 Ameen
6519 2018-08-03 16:40:32 For 16years, with all the revenues generated from crude oil, they left us in darkness, with no effort to light up  the country. They looted and squandered the money for Power.

By God’s grace we’ll never return to that bandage!

6521 2018-08-03 16:40:18 Devil's advocate here but - if you use non-vegan toiletry, if you eat palm oil at all, if you do a non-vegan job or work for a company that is involved some way in animal harm. If you feed your dog meat. If you take meds or vaccs....Some will say "not vegan".

6532 2018-08-03 16:39:06 It was named for the man and his wife who owned all that land down there and wildcatted the famous Yates Oil Field. It’s still producing since the early ‘20s.

6541 2018-08-03 16:38:08 Not sure any of the rulers who plundered the resource would be alive then- they would have gone to the place where the oil came from.
6542 2018-08-03 16:38:03 I also substitute sugar and creamer in my coffe with coconut oil 
6543 2018-08-03 16:38:02 Yeah I agree that it’s case by case and that kids shouldn’t be on meds like that... it can’t be good for their developing brains at all! I’ve looked into CBD oil as an alternative
6544 2018-08-03 16:37:53 @alicia_annmarie is the best friend i could ever ask for, took my car to get an oil change, vacuuming it & coming to see me at lunch

6549 2018-08-03 16:37:16 Money is the oil that makes capitalism work. It needs to be flowing and changing hands often.

Your heirs didn't work for the money and will make their fortunes off of your knowledge and connections, or they won't and that's their failing.

6553 2018-08-03 16:36:46 So are the government going to dictate world oil and gas prices. Very interesting. How much is this all going to cost the nation, sorry not the nation those actually paying tax ?
6554 2018-08-03 16:36:32 motor oil isnt for drinking
6555 2018-08-03 16:36:32 Trump is doing his best to support his extremely rich friends and the companies they own. Trump has done nothing but lie to the American People and a lot of them still hang on his every word. The coal industry is not back up and running. And now he wants to open up Alaska for oil

6563 2018-08-03 16:35:04 Sadly yet more death's today in Afghanistan due to terrorism. Blairites must be so happy with yet more Innocent Blood spilt in the name of oil.

6571 2018-08-03 16:34:34 I might overestimate gains from immigration, but surely not from trade? Maybe those interests are just more diffuse? For oil and gas, this is a fight for life and death. (But then: tobacco is doing well even after losing their battle; gas/oil could dominate renewables.)
6572 2018-08-03 16:34:32 I cannot imagine! My Father got a law degree (his dad made him, the 40's were different) yet never practiced a day in his life. Went to work in oil fields as he said it was easier than deciphering the nuances of law all day.
6573 2018-08-03 16:34:08 Not to mention Texas would've been in recession if Obama hadn't increased national oil and gas production. It's the only thing propping up our economy.
6574 2018-08-03 16:34:07 Oops hit send, my truck costs $90 for a filter and oil change.
6575 2018-08-03 16:34:00 Fucked up when people are driving so slow on international highway that the uhaul trucks and oil trucks need to drive in the left lane to go around them

6579 2018-08-03 16:33:32 I changed my oil few years ago at total filling station service center , I was billed 10k . My engine got knocked after 2 weeks . Apparently they used a bad/wrong oil filter . Those guys are overrated .
6580 2018-08-03 16:33:28 The cause of the massacre of the Azzaid brothers is Massoud Barzani, the withdrawal of the forces that had ordered his son delighted with an agreement with a preacher for the purpose of controlling the oil trade
6581 2018-08-03 16:33:23 Chinese spy outed in Senate Intel Committee

6583 2018-08-03 16:32:51 Someone needs to create a new essential oil called ‘Leave Me the Hell Alone.’  ... best line in that!
6584 2018-08-03 16:32:34 Nooooooooo a oil mark!!!!  1 oil pan bolt is going to be the death of me.
6585 2018-08-03 16:32:34 California is run by Democrats who support fracking & oil companies. Democrats dont help the planet when theyre bought by the same corporate interests as the Republicans.
6586 2018-08-03 16:32:31 I have the best little brother ever.  He's running to get my oil changed while I am at work so my car doesn't blow up on the way to Kansas. @DrSixFingersEsq
6587 2018-08-03 16:32:30 I can’t understand y Jamaicans r not outraged at the $7 per liter levy that we r paying for petrol at the pump. Remember d $7 per liter was towards the hedge (insurance) against high oil prices, we no longer pay that insurance, so y continue 2 pay d Levy. #Unconscionable.
6588 2018-08-03 16:32:13 You may be bawling, but last time I looked Jamaican public transport fares hadn't budged much since oil prices went on a tear after 2014, so public & private operators much either have very deep pockets or should be dying on their feet, yet that seems not 2b so. #JustSaying
6589 2018-08-03 16:32:02 Bullsh*t. When they were trapped on Mt. Sinjar he ordered them to be rescued. Recall Iraqi Kurds, though tough, weren't able to protect it when ISIS moved in from prev taking Mosul 

It’s true US Army resources may have protected them if were shifted from protecting oil pipelines
6590 2018-08-03 16:32:00 He promised to continue pushing our NATO allies to increase their defense spending, aimed at countering the Russian threat. He promised to continue insisting that the EU purchase more American LNG, while reducing their purchases of Russian oil. Not bad for a Russian agent.

6597 2018-08-03 16:31:17 I have naturally curly hair and I use products that can be found in the "ethnic hair" section. I have baby hairs and sometimes sleep with my hair wrapped up and I use coconut oil and shea butter and things that are traditionally for black people but it's about function & utility
6598 2018-08-03 16:31:12 POTUS can't do much. Comerica Bank carries the 'paper' on America (Comerica). The bank stock went public around 2004. Islamic oil cash has bought into that bank, meaning with corporate takeover - America goes with it. That's the fight.

6600 2018-08-03 16:31:02 There are already some preliminary signs that the global economic expansion has started to slow under pressure from higher oil prices and the costs and uncertainty created by the trade conflict.

6612 2018-08-03 16:29:58 I so agree with all you write, esp. re: children. Why is it that so many people seem to ignore the solutions, or even deny, going against evidence, that e.g. the renewables industry offers far more long-term jobs than yet another oil pipeline?

6632 2018-08-03 16:27:58 Someone in NIESR did propose that Scotland could sell off all of its ownership of North Sea oil and gas rights to pay off some of its debt if it became independent.

It would make independence feel like being hit on the head with a 10lb hammer instead of a 15lb one!
6633 2018-08-03 16:27:53 can someone clarify this for me

i am of the understanding that the previous JA Gov't instituted a tax to pay for an oil hedge against a rise in price

the current JA Gov't discontinued the hedge yet is STILL taxing us

6648 2018-08-03 16:25:58 Those countries had savings and alternate plans during falling oil prices... and they did suffer. There were harsh economic problems when oil prices dropped for them - but  it’s hard to overstress how much oil was the sole economic factor to Venezuela.

6664 2018-08-03 16:23:05 The dealership called to say my SLK 500 Turbo is due for an oil change. I asked how soon they could come out and do it, and they told me I have to drive it to the dealership! Absurd!
6665 2018-08-03 16:22:58 Heres some food for thought on the clean air business:

I just had a fella in the cab who is in the oil business. 

He told me the 9, yes 9 - nine, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 largest ships in the world are collectively more polluting than every motor vehicle on this planet.
6666 2018-08-03 16:22:56 The latest #abiye's assertion that only 5% of oil revenue from #Ogaden basin belongs to Somali region is yet another indication that EPRDF has not changed.

6673 2018-08-03 16:22:28 Jamaica is a price taker for many things, including crude oil. It's not as if we are sitting in a position vastly different from other countries in that regard. If we're really concerned about how oil prices affect us, then belatedly we'd better start weaning away from it, fast.

6677 2018-08-03 16:21:41 Yes I read it 3 days ago. I'm not sure what point you're trying to make. Impact on competitiveness was always there, e.g.NB's refinery = 70% of Cda's refined oil exports yet it's not in mix of those getting a break, 'though our argument about competitiveness is same as for steel.

6733 2018-08-04 23:56:48 I bet The US tried to take him out via third party and install a puppet, C’mon people stop acting new, Venezuela has a lot of oil and the US wants control.
6734 2018-08-04 23:56:44 Dudes be advertising beard growth oil now... The extra money is always nice I guess.
6735 2018-08-04 23:56:42 450million of taxpayers money to a Foundation made up of oil companies and climate change deniers. No public tendering. No transparency. It beggars belief.  This government does not govern for Australia. #Auspol #reef #reefgate

6748 2018-08-04 23:54:17 Super simple. I’ve seen people mess it up by adding too much. Fresh ahi-grade tuna, Maui onions, seaweed, seasame oil, and a little toasted sesame seeds. Perfection.

Then humans dig up and drill fossil carbon fuels (coal/ oil/ gas), combust it, and *no surprise*, the CO2 concentration goes up. 

Not. A. Surprise.

6866 2018-08-04 23:37:57 This works out well & once they graduate HS most of them are employed. When my niece graduated from Vo-Tech she was hired immediately & given a $1,000 sign on bonus (crumbs) & assistance w tuition to OSU to become an RN. My sister is a welder on an oil platform which is a hoot!
6867 2018-08-04 23:37:16 You are aware that climate change, as you define it, is a hoax! You're a fraud Senator, like the "snake oil salesmen" of the old West, you and your ilk. #ClimateFraud #Hoax
6868 2018-08-04 23:37:15 Double oil batches of popcorn were the best - until you went home smelling like popcorn every night and realized you couldn’t stand to eat it or be around it anymore
6869 2018-08-04 23:36:59 The dollar should ramp up hard... This means oil and gold will collapse off the next few months.. beyond that yes the dollar will be  obliterated
6870 2018-08-04 23:36:46 Full it up! Damn right! You’re talking my favorite language Darlin! Oil and gas! I’m from Texas and when you see those prices go up, know my friends kids are going to college! And living large!

6871 2018-08-04 23:36:16 Yes, getting 350 degree oil sprayed in and around your eye is damn enjoyable. I think I would also like to do it to my other eye since my good one is shot. Vision is blurry. Greatness. Stupid Henny Penny.
6872 2018-08-04 23:36:11 Well, I'll be. You really are a pro at this!
6873 2018-08-04 23:35:52 If your a singer try one teaspoon of olive oil in your salad dressing, it really is good for your health and makes singing easier. 
6874 2018-08-04 23:35:44 The oil companies now run the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  The banks make laws, and elections are compromised. 
We need to take to the streets.
6875 2018-08-04 23:35:43 Just got the estimate to get my suspension and shocks fixed and bitch is like over 1k. I cried and just took my oil change. 
6876 2018-08-04 23:35:38 모자캐릭터 너무 조아ㅠ
6877 2018-08-04 23:35:26 If you're not offended by "alternative" treatments look into using apple cider vinegar or google Edgar Cayce, gallstones, castor oil packs.
6878 2018-08-04 23:35:25 And he is using the tariffs against steel to bring back the steel sectors or at least build it up stronger. Didn’t Japan bomb Pearl Harbor because we cut off steal and oil and other war related commodity exports to them?
6879 2018-08-04 23:35:20 Yo this lip oil tho.... this lip oil is EVERYTHINGGGGGGGG
6880 2018-08-04 23:35:12 So I just found out they make 130k a year in Alberta to work a trash oil rig job... fam sign me up for a year, we moving downtown after
6881 2018-08-04 23:35:10 Accord hybrid does 47 but it will be 6000$ more after oil dudes tarriffs

6883 2018-08-04 23:34:47 @JohnKasich  instead of hoarding all the gas and oil money for The 3 C’s. Throw some back our way to eastern Ohio     Just saying
6884 2018-08-04 23:34:45 Apart from a fuel pellet substitute and organic matter for compost, What other uses is there for coffee waste post coffee oil extraction?
6885 2018-08-04 23:34:40 That’s what US sanctions & oil price manipulation brought on. Things were going quite well in Venezuela until 2014. Socialism is doing quite well in Bolivia, China, Ecuador. Cuba’s economy is expanding with new market reforms. Saying socialism always has these results is a lie.
6886 2018-08-04 23:34:26 At the oil change place and they asked me to pop my hood. I popped the trunk. I need to go back to bed.
6887 2018-08-04 23:34:13 According to WalMart Tire and Lube, burning the midnight oil is NOT a good thing when it comes to a car. So I guess at 141k miles, the Scion is getting its first service call.
6888 2018-08-04 23:33:51 Find an Italian and squeeze the oil out of them. Just heat up some ragu, open a window and wait for one to come through to yell at you about how to make his nonna’s sauce!
6889 2018-08-04 23:33:47 Nothing like a touch of segregation to oil the wheels of racism.
6890 2018-08-04 23:33:38 Full team effort.  We need germany to buy gas .P eople to buy american.  Nato to buy weapons from USA.
Sell oil in our reserve
6891 2018-08-04 23:33:34 it’s some kind of weird oil bc the silly string is like 10 years old??? i’ll probably try to pick up some of that anyway tho lmao thank you aaaaaa
6892 2018-08-04 23:33:23 I've used oil but def prefer butter. Or bacon grease yaaaaaas

6895 2018-08-04 23:32:50 Salad of cucumber, raspberries, blueberries, finely chopped baby leek. Dressed with oil and leftover syrup from roasting strawberries in balsamic.
6896 2018-08-04 23:32:32 Coconut oil is always the answer lol
6897 2018-08-04 23:32:27 i have one just sitting my dude, and it runs, just gotta work on transmission cause it leaked the oil.
6898 2018-08-04 23:32:26 Downplay what, Russia didn't effect the election?  

Let's talk russia, what's the plan? Surround russia with more troops, more sanctions, bring down the price of oil.  What do you want Trump to do?
6899 2018-08-04 23:32:21 I've been at the Ninja Division booth most of the weekend. I'm heading to Lucas Oil right now.
6900 2018-08-04 23:32:16 def try coconut oil hun, great for the hair
also when youre using shampoo and conditioner make sure you're putting the shampoo closer to the roots of your hair and the conditioner more away from your roots.
6901 2018-08-04 23:31:59 夜通しライブお疲れ様でした！今度意地でもロマンスカーに乗ってやろうと思います
6902 2018-08-04 23:31:50 Venezuela is a perfect example of a failure of capitalism. I'm not credulous. I don't care what politicians SAY they are going to do. I care what they do. Venezuela's  government relied on selling oil for imports. The inevitable result? Dutch disease and collapse.
6903 2018-08-04 23:31:47 Russian's economy is massive reliant on oil exports.
6904 2018-08-04 23:31:40 Your right the country has been in a halt for 3 years. Sad when marijuana is the no. 1 topic for a platform and no. 1 news item daily - where is our country headed?? Oil discounted 30% to our American neighbours (Make America Great Again) - can't build refineries, no LNG, Need PC
6905 2018-08-04 23:31:31 No Idea, but I live in Bangor I'll Ave a go at it for ya, 2 for 1 on bulbs this week, and while you are sobbing with pure joy at the great work I have done, I'll change the oil in the car for you. 
6906 2018-08-04 23:31:28 I like his swift move on cannabis oil for medical use.
6907 2018-08-04 23:31:18 does anyone know the best place to buy CBD oil???
6908 2018-08-04 23:31:02 Correction.. Oregano oil not oil of oregano. Wild Mediterranean works exceptionally well.

6910 2018-08-04 23:30:54 It could be possible to use matte finish on dry skin if they lay down a primer oil first. I do this on clients who are adamant they want Matte when they have dry skin

6913 2018-08-04 23:30:01 Yesterday I went into Holland&Barrett to buy some cod liver oil capsules. Today I get an email asking how I would rate that experience. Really? Walked in, picked up capsules and paid. What am I supposed to say? #theworldsgoingcrackers
6914 2018-08-04 23:29:42 As I said take it face value if you'd like. Correlation does not equal causation though. 
There some other studies you can look at that do this as well.
Studies from the tabacoo industry about smoking not being harmful.
The oil industry and lead not being harmful.

6925 2018-08-04 23:28:29 The usability of @InfoChip spans many industries, including oil & gas and mining, allowing you to track assets anywhere.
6926 2018-08-04 23:28:01 How?? While palm oil prices plunges
6927 2018-08-04 23:27:38 if u didnt have to like wait a while to put on clothes tho coconut oil would be the best moisturizer
6928 2018-08-04 23:27:26 If you watch the world service from the usa you get adverts every 15mins or so for united arab emirates and...all the oil companies!!! Yes they've sold out. Have to say you dont really realize how bad they are until you step outside the propaganda machine for a while. Soaps too
6929 2018-08-04 23:27:20 I am a victim of twitter’s ban, I have been in solitary confinement everyday since I started. I am calling on @realDonaldTrump to do something. Remember Standard Oil .....lets do it.

Please help me by retweeting it’s the only way we can get our voices heard.
6930 2018-08-04 23:27:14 i use aveeno on my face and inside elbows and shit religiously cause i get eczema. sometimes i go full effect and do the rest of the arms and bod after a good loofahing. if im really feeling like a king and i have uh time i use coconut oil but that usually ends up going somewhere
6931 2018-08-04 23:27:00 Since everyone’s skin is so different it’s hard to give you like my best recommendations, but I have almost all of my clients on a specific all oil routine. Im gonna dm it to you !!
6932 2018-08-04 23:26:19 Yes...olive oil and lotsa garlic 
6933 2018-08-04 23:26:18 tampoco se ve pueblo solo milicianos corriendo en estampida y se oyen voces de huir por la derecha
6934 2018-08-04 23:26:16 あっっ！今日プリキュアないの？！？！
6935 2018-08-04 23:26:06 All of those tourists covered with oil.
6936 2018-08-04 23:26:01 Si andan por Capilla del Monte, por ningún motivo vayan a comprar a la Oil que está sobre la ruta. Recién me llevé una Powerade chiquita y tuve que dejar el 2% del pase de Pavón.
6937 2018-08-04 23:25:55 True! That oil will bring a lot more. The only way forward is peaceful talks of all parties on the table. The same forgiveness/reconciliation speeches we have been observing in the diaspora community should be given to the city that needs it most so they feel the inclusion.

6939 2018-08-04 23:25:49 @SacZAP I love you with all my heart and soul it saddens me to be in doubt toward everyone not knowing who to trust who really loves me I want to trust and be trusted and never break that trust. I remember Alice in Wonderland. My mom did an oil painting of Alice in Wonderland.
6940 2018-08-04 23:25:33 First job was a movie theater too. It was there that I learned that the oil, not butter, is what makes the popcorn so tasty.
6941 2018-08-04 23:25:30 i think that every white suburban family has an oil painting of a small italian town somewhere in their house
6942 2018-08-04 23:25:17 So the roots oil makes the hair on chest grow too cos i can see hair on yo chest and in between yo boobs
6943 2018-08-04 23:25:16 Got 65th place out of 2500 players in sfv. My road, balrog, urien, karin, terrences chun beat me, then made it out of pools in runbacks. Day 2.

6948 2018-08-04 23:24:23 That looks fabulous – is that olive oil mixed in?
6949 2018-08-04 23:24:22 That is super freaking cool!!
6950 2018-08-04 23:23:58 si realmente lo hubieran querido matar lo hubieran hecho lo tenian en vitrina. esas explosiones fueron para que el mundo vea la cobardia y estampida del ejercito y su pandilla de gobierno. en segundos el video se hizo viral en el mundo.
6951 2018-08-04 23:23:53 Lol at people putting on castor oil yo make eyelashes grow. Like fam. Hair is synthesized protein. LLLL
6952 2018-08-04 23:23:46 The world is an infinitely better place with all 3 Higgins boys.

6955 2018-08-04 23:23:31 Don't believe all the medical advice you get from the Internet. One web site said that coconut oil will kill the Herpes virus. That isn't true. A friend of mine had sex wth a coconut and he still has sores on his, uh nevermind.
6956 2018-08-04 23:23:27 뿍
6957 2018-08-04 23:23:23 Of course, I just got back from the grocery store and didn’t grab any olive oil thinking “we def have that.”

Nope. Not a fucking drop of the good stuff here
6958 2018-08-04 23:23:21 Mark not disagreeing as I have no 1st hand knowledge. Yet I can not find a structured pathway forward off of oil. Infrastructure needed? Amount of electricity needed? ROI for the average person switching to electric. Battery replacement and disposal costs?
6959 2018-08-04 23:23:17 Final status report:
Finally leaving location.... Fuck the oil field
6960 2018-08-04 23:23:13 Grape seed oil >
6961 2018-08-04 23:23:04 Breaking our deal with Iran was a gift to Russia. It makes their oil more needed and valuable.
6962 2018-08-04 23:23:04 꾹
6963 2018-08-04 23:23:01 Based on oil!
6964 2018-08-04 23:23:00 To treat lice, apply olive oil to your hair, and leave on for at least 40 minutes. Shampoo after.
6965 2018-08-04 23:22:35 When I got my oil changed today the guy told me I had the cleanest air filter he has EVER seen.
6966 2018-08-04 23:22:20 @adnickens trusted by whom?
6967 2018-08-04 23:21:55 Got olbas oil in my eye, actually end my life
6968 2018-08-04 23:21:20 Does anyone use CBD oil?
6969 2018-08-04 23:21:11 So Russian and Iranian oil companies can sell oil in the US and profit.
6970 2018-08-04 23:20:59 I use coconut oil for literally everything! 10/10 recommend
6971 2018-08-04 23:20:49 Haven’t you learned how socialist have failed throughout history? Hugo Chavez has exploited his country, look in South America it’s happening now and it doesn’t take too long! Venezuela oil rich and now they have nothing, in the here and now! Politicians are thieves, you get noda
6972 2018-08-04 23:20:45 This shit is fuckin vegetable oil
6973 2018-08-04 23:20:35 Got hot oil in my eye when I was cooking eggs and it's fucking killing 
6974 2018-08-04 23:20:28 He is a greedy lunatic that has grocery store shelves empty.  This is a country that has all of the oil they could need yet its citizens live impoverished
6975 2018-08-04 23:20:25 Whoever promotes oil pipelines obviously is criminal when it exposes the environment 2 these risks. OH& S 4 the environment ppl. Organise & poke them in the 'I's'!!!QUICKLY!
6976 2018-08-04 23:19:33 aqui no hay oposicion ya la MUD no exisste lo que son pequeññas voces advirtiendo lo que sucede en venezuela y llamando a paro de transporte en protestas por el censo.

6980 2018-08-04 23:19:04 In 2018, anyone found guilty of land clearing or promoting new coal mines, CSG, LNG, or oil, should be going to jail. Forest & woodland increases rainfall & replenishes aquifers, and is a carbon sink, as well as a haven of biodiversity. Climate change will make droughts severe.
6981 2018-08-04 23:19:03 Not too keen on this weird stretching feeling. I need to oil up. #bodychanges
6982 2018-08-04 23:19:02 Seamus OReagan. If we understand you, your Govt is letting in Illegal Immigrants & refugees cause you need their minimum wage tiny taxes. Why not use Hundreds of Billions we are losing with no pipeline to our east coast. Stop Ont & Que buy Tanker Oil from Arabs & Venezuela & USA.
6983 2018-08-04 23:19:00 KE facial oil and toner and tarabusi sugar cookie mask
6984 2018-08-04 23:18:32 Or a jiffy lube worker that gives the Wilpons a free oil change whenever they need one

6986 2018-08-04 23:18:10 More the result of basing your entire state funding apparatus off oil but sure western propaganda xd
6987 2018-08-04 23:17:51 he was just a secular nationalist, imo. nationalizing the oil industry doesn’t necessarily make him a socialist.
6988 2018-08-04 23:17:49 Alright so I’ll take a chicken cordon bleu w/ provolone, toasted, lettuce, banana peppers, peppercorn gourmet sauce, olive oil and salt and pepper. Thanks babe.
6989 2018-08-04 23:17:10 Anyone out there know about Kawasaki jet skis??  We’ve got a 2004 Kawasaki Ultra DI 130 (2 stroke). Trying to figure out how to check the oil level since there’s no dipstick on a 2 stroke. #Kawasaki #jetski
6990 2018-08-04 23:16:48 Obviously, we've had some struggles this year, but times like these make you appreciate all of the hard work and tremendous effort that goes into this race team. So proud of my guys! They never surrender!! @philipgmathew I  copy and paste to make awareness. @Rico_Abreu #strong
6991 2018-08-04 23:16:46 It's an oil rich country being sanctioned by the usa, let that sink in!
6992 2018-08-04 23:16:27 Do you think it has anything to do with oil?
6993 2018-08-04 23:16:21 Coconut oil beard and scalp
6994 2018-08-04 23:16:06 Everyone #QAnon is going to be so bummed when #Q is just @elonmusk and his new #Tesla model that fires throwing stars out of its trunk and lays down oil slicks to stop Boris and Natasha #boobytraps #JamesBond
6995 2018-08-04 23:16:06 Mostly vegetable oil ^.^ stuff is garb!
6996 2018-08-04 23:15:49 Soak nails in olive oil for five minutes for deep moisturizing.
6997 2018-08-04 23:15:37 We have a heck of a deal on our Siskiyou Sungrown CBD oil! Swing by to relieve some pain at an insane price!

6999 2018-08-04 23:15:30 Been to College Gameday Twice at Lucas Oil and it was awesome. I bet it’s even cooler on a campus.
7000 2018-08-04 23:15:18 Chipotle is garbage.
7001 2018-08-04 23:15:14 any govt, or media who support a govt, who gives a billion dollars to news corp and half a billion to shale oil extractors on the great barrier #reefgate can shut the hell up about a few dollars for farmers #insiders
7002 2018-08-04 23:15:12 When The Pressing Is Over, The Oil Is Gonna Flow. God Will Get The Glory. The is power that comes out of the pressure, there is strength that comes out of the pressure, there is a deliverance that comes out of the pressure!
7003 2018-08-04 23:15:00 What’s the dumbest Simpsons quote that regularly gets stuck in your head?

For me, it’s Rainier Wolfcastle saying “Who’s up for coconut oil?” to his muscles.
7004 2018-08-04 23:14:57 EVERYONE connected with Trump are also connected  to the Kremlin, Torshin, Oligarch Cypriot Kremlin Bankers, Wilbur Ross, GAZPROM, Russian Syrian Iran Kazakhstan Oil Pipeline.
7005 2018-08-04 23:14:56 Oil fall prank
7006 2018-08-04 23:14:35 I wish tf someone would try to slather my vagina with coconut oil during sex.
7007 2018-08-04 23:14:35 Welcome to the club 
Compra bio oil, Ajuda buee
7008 2018-08-04 23:14:00 I'm never quite sure how universal my experience is bc Oil has this weird counter-cycle. There was basically a 20-year hiring freeze while the rest of the country did great, then they panicked when mass retirements loomed and they found Millennials would NOT go to Bakersfield.
7009 2018-08-04 23:13:54 Haha. No, Russia has always been the enemy and they are pushing these videos. Every president before pissboy was helping to crush them by destroying the $ value of oil. They were on their knees until pissboy came along.
7010 2018-08-04 23:13:32 Maduro better stop holding military speech cause one his not really that popular 2 his enemy of the USA and the elites 3 oil is looking  very lucrative in Venezuela since Maduro took the country into devastation its gonna be easy to kill of the rest of the population.

7013 2018-08-04 23:13:05 Oil company banned Tesla coil ignition efficient carburetors added cat  converters used gas additives to cheat us and we worry about the lawyers  making demands on car industry when oil can't let go of Nikola Tesla  free energy suppression
7014 2018-08-04 23:12:58 I'm counting on that! WFPB NO OIL here....
7015 2018-08-04 23:12:41 Trump & Sec. of Interior Ryan Zinke are attacking our National Parks & Wildlife Reserves with gusto. The plan is to turn them into hotels, entertainment parks, oil fields, coal fields plus letting our endangered species be hunted to extinction. They will do anything to.....
7016 2018-08-04 23:12:23 It's good you visit the remotest villages in the east, north, in the west and in the south to discover that 60% of Nigerians living in the rural areas don't enjoy a minute electricity yearly. So the 7kMW will be for Aso Rock, residential areas for oil workers and politicians.
7017 2018-08-04 23:12:20 Right a free oil change isn’t worth it if they fuck up every time
7018 2018-08-04 23:12:15 えwwwwwwwwwwwwやばwwwwwwwwwwwww

7019 2018-08-04 23:12:14 So Mary wasted a years worth of salary when she poured her oil on Jesus? The widow wasted her last two mites? The Bible is full of extravagant gifts to God,David’s temple, Solomon’s 1000 bull offering, Abraham’s 1st born, etc. How can the gospel reach the world without money?
7020 2018-08-04 23:12:08 It was always oil.

7026 2018-08-04 23:11:06 I was on SSRIs and sleep meds for 20 years. After menopause (I’m 60 now) I felt better so I very slowly weaned myself off all. Sleep issues are now resolved with high doses of CBD oil. I think a lot of my anxiety issues may have been hormonal
7027 2018-08-04 23:11:02 Yeah that man put extra baby oil on before the game!

7050 2018-08-04 23:06:17 They mean tools. Like do you use acrylic or oil or metal or photography or photo manipulation software or pen and pencil, etc. It can even mean surface, such as paper or glass or concrete. Mixed media means using more than one in conjunction.
7051 2018-08-04 23:05:44 Next time: buy a cheap glass mug or bowl, keep it by the range, line it with aluminum foil.  Pour in the oil until it cools to where you can deal with it.  If it's fat, like sausage or beef grease, let it harden and throw it away wrapped in the foil.
7052 2018-08-04 23:05:42 Yes! Just let it use you lol. Next time mix it with coconut oil
7053 2018-08-04 23:05:39 Sorry but when it's a socialist country AND it has lots of oil, we just can't resist
7054 2018-08-04 23:05:38 Like selling out the Canadian oil industry to the Chinese ie: Nexen etc. Remember you and #harperman did that. Andy you lie in a glass house stop throwing rocks. #AndyofMayberry
7055 2018-08-04 23:05:21 Everyday fossil-fuel commuter cars might go the way of the dodo in 15 years, but heavy transport industry is very reliant on oil. Hard to imagine battery-based replacement for jet fuel and marine diesel in 15 years.
7056 2018-08-04 23:05:20 There used to be more there than just oil industry. When they nationalized everything, they either ran it in the ground or the companies left. That, is what socialism does.
7057 2018-08-04 23:05:00 Use "sports tape", though: that adhesive stuff is hard to get off without losing skin.....
7058 2018-08-04 23:04:52 Beginnings of a military coup?
The Americans coming for the oil already?
7059 2018-08-04 23:04:44 Which doesn't mean I'm not a little in awe of his service, even if he changed Humvee oil all day and scrubbed pots at night.
But if being in the military automatically makes you infallible in all things, I'd ship my out as soon as he turned 18.
7060 2018-08-04 23:04:31 I used to respect you @oil_shaeikh but you talk to much on this street nowadays. Must you engage with everyone? Have self control mana.
7061 2018-08-04 23:04:15 Protest this the products were made from oil !
7062 2018-08-04 23:04:06 Friedman says that placing the shareholders above all will lead to the betterment of society.
Then what about Flint, fracking, and oil spills?
How do you explain this?

7063 2018-08-04 23:04:06 You must need some sunflower oil then?!
7064 2018-08-04 23:04:01 What was the starting line up lol. PEI is the only race we don’t get to. Love your practice tweets, the heat race and the results but you never tweet the starting line up
7065 2018-08-04 23:04:00 They defaulted on [IMF (iirc)] loans and their oil can be seized by creditors in int'l waters(?) or when it arrives at port, just like getting your car repo'ed.

Chavez' bro-in-law really knew how to run an oil co.. His crony food producers had ppl eating house and zoo animals
7066 2018-08-04 23:03:57 The oil companies were still promising lifetime employment in those days but you're right, they were already lying.

By the time I started work they threatened us, "Transfer here or be fired!" So we'd go across the street to a competitor. Y'all are just gonna lay us off anyway.
7067 2018-08-04 23:03:55 I love the Kora Noni oil. I use it on my cuticles, lips, eyelashes, and skin. I love it
7068 2018-08-04 23:03:30 I feel the most like my grandma’s granddaughter when my fingers are stained with enchilada sauce, and any time I cook with vegetable oil (the scent of veg oil heating up in a hot skilletvisceral reaction)
7069 2018-08-04 23:03:27 How much oil do you want more, Mr. globalist pigs, you can't even feed tens of millions in poverty in your country. @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama have you hugged each n every one of the Vegas shooting survivors, like Hollywood sleep with their guns under their pillows?
7070 2018-08-04 23:03:16 THANK YOU for taking the time and making the effort to stay of top the issue!  What is your estimate, how soon before YOU are called an oil company shill ... ?

nationalization of a foreign-run oil company isn't the same thing as communism
7076 2018-08-04 23:02:12 Nobody with that kind of sexy, flirty avi could be all that awkward!

(somebody has to say it...!)
7077 2018-08-04 23:02:04 The car industry actually spoke out about this. It’s the oil companies who pushed for this.
7078 2018-08-04 23:01:44 Big Oil and Big Auto. How is this a question or a story? The same things have been happening for 75 years.
7079 2018-08-04 23:01:26 I told you two things, both correct, and backed up my words.
1) Revenues from oil have averaged circa £6bn pa. 
2) Not all revenue is disaggregated for Scotland by UK.
7080 2018-08-04 23:01:08 It was a thoughtful, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

7086 2018-08-04 23:00:40 So far I've purchased from physical books, ebooks, olive oil club is.

7094 2018-08-04 22:59:04 I put that pork steak in the oven, with a teaspoon of vegetable oil on it, lightly sprinkled garlic salt on it, cooked it, and it was golden on both sides because I flipped it. Then turned the oven off, lightly brushed it with bbq sauce, let it sit a few minutes and it was good.

7108 2018-08-04 22:57:02 A couple of gedankenexperiments. 

Suppose research developed over the next ten years that olive oil, rather than being beneficial, was net harmful and increased all cause deaths when compared to not using it (replacing it with anything), like was found with trans fats.

Was cashiering at work today and a lady comes in. She puts a jug of vegetable oil on my register and says ring me up. I proceed to check her out and I ask "Cooking up some fries for dinner?" to which she replied "Nah just a slip n' slide". She takes her oil and leaves
7113 2018-08-04 22:56:11 I've had those kind of slips before but it usually results in me falling into a harem of Tahitian goddesses in the midst of a Hawaiian Tropic oil wrestling competition. Clothing optional....

7130 2018-08-04 22:53:42 Stopping the pipeline won’t stop the world from using oil, it will just stop them from using OUR oil. Other oil producing countries will get the jobs and added revenue from their resources while we miss out. Not very smart.

7151 2018-08-04 22:49:46 I also take the oil. Have for a couple of years now. From the MS I have severe burning pain in my arms. It still amazes me how much better the pain is. My Doctor suggested the oil form.
7152 2018-08-04 22:49:26 Yes. And colluding with Russia by buy gas and oil. Might as well declare Putin leader of world. If he pulls plug, they perish.
7153 2018-08-04 22:49:25 Awkward trapeze artist.
7154 2018-08-04 22:49:10 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
7155 2018-08-04 22:48:51 Well, haven't you been contemplating some interesting ideas.....
7156 2018-08-04 22:48:49 Oil at 200 Trumps wet dream!
7157 2018-08-04 22:48:40 I have a tea tree oil but now that i know it’ll hurt my cat i’m getting rid of it and any other oils that will hurt him > : (
7158 2018-08-04 22:48:34 I always mix balsamic vinegar with my olive oil mayo. Is balsamic mayo already a thing? 
7159 2018-08-04 22:48:23 No,oil maybe when oil prices rise
7160 2018-08-04 22:48:08 Coconut oil ?Avocado oils ?
7161 2018-08-04 22:48:08 Fish oil, vitamin D (or a multivitamin), fruit. You should be getting enough aminos from the milk.

Forgot to add probiotics & collagen to the main list. All that stuff can get expensive tho I get it.
7162 2018-08-04 22:48:05 Shit how much for a oil change
7163 2018-08-04 22:47:57 Twirl of nice Extra Virgin Olive oil n balsamic glaze!
7164 2018-08-04 22:47:49 1/4 cup almonds: 4360 mg omega 6
1/4 cup grain fed beef: 286 mg  1/4 cup grass fed beef: 120 mg coconut oil: 2057. The difference in the 2 kinds of beef is order of magnitude smaller than many other common foods.
7165 2018-08-04 22:47:44 I love olive oil

7169 2018-08-04 22:47:02 RBC: Oil Market Will Tighten Amid Significant Loss of Ant Crude
7170 2018-08-04 22:47:00 1. Ok lets be Americans what President is negotiating with Europe to take away 50% of Russians profits from its sale of natural gas to the EU? Who? Trump. That will collapse Russia. Natural gas and oil is 60% of their GDP but no Trump loves Russia.
7171 2018-08-04 22:46:56 Stop lying, Lisa. You don't care about a safer, healthier environment for Alaskans. If you did, you'd prioritize renewable energy, wilderness preservation, and protecting the waters of Alaska instead of oil and mining. #NoDrillinginANWR #ProtectheArctic
7172 2018-08-04 22:46:11 This one just told me after I already declined, “come make me feel better. Everyone has been walking by me saying ‘no.’ Come here let me put some oil on you.”
7173 2018-08-04 22:45:47 This has all to do with the recent crash in the price of oil. This is all starting to comeback now.
7174 2018-08-04 22:45:44 my mum is obsessed with coconut oil ahah
7175 2018-08-04 22:45:15 GLAMOUR: Rarely use an essential oil.
7176 2018-08-04 22:44:27 the mineral oil is for when you're thirsty right
7177 2018-08-04 22:44:15 "The grooviest and nastiest things in the world cannot be ingested or even fondled - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
7178 2018-08-04 22:43:53 True but timing is all wrong for an increase now. Oil price rise and other factors contributing to rise in inflation.
7179 2018-08-04 22:43:41 A favourite of mine (courtesy of a Canadian having spent time down under): baby spinach, avocado, cherry tomatoes and cheddar cheese. Olive oil and Modena vinegar for dressing . If you don’t count avocados as fruit it should do
7180 2018-08-04 22:43:31 Till then that oil has to come from somewhere we could stop drilling for oil in this country which is bankrupt a lot of the oil and gas companies and we would be paying three times more than what they pay overseas for fuel because we have to get the fuel imported
7181 2018-08-04 22:42:39 SNP white paper prior to the 2014 Referendum was based on oil at $120 per barrel. 2015 around $50 per barrel, 2016 around $40, 2017 around $50 per barrel, and 2018 just above $70 per barrel. Would need unprecedented change in North Sea production for Independence support to grow.
7182 2018-08-04 22:42:31 Is this thing still going ?
OK
Time for pictures then.
7183 2018-08-04 22:42:16 Your leaders are more corrupt, they have companies extracting oil and harvesting opium poppies from those countries and getting rich while they tell they are fighting terrorism.

7186 2018-08-04 22:40:54 I learned a hard lesson today. I don’t remember how to use oil paint. So my beautiful canvas looked like baby poop by the time I was done.

7192 2018-08-04 22:40:22 Mineral oil.
7193 2018-08-04 22:40:17 @Walmart please explain to me how you automotive department closes at 7 in York Pa and the refuse to do my oil at 6:15 even though their bays were empty. The rep was extremely rude and said they stop taking orders at 1pm.
7194 2018-08-04 22:40:09 You're pressed harder than olive oil right about now
7195 2018-08-04 22:40:07 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！

7200 2018-08-04 22:38:45 If we’re talking about what is in evidence today, yes.  Unanticipated developments can happen, like unconventional gas and oil extraction.

7203 2018-08-04 22:38:20 It’s a bit dense so you don’t need a lot of product. I don’t find it clarifying like stripping out oil. My hair isn’t more dry when I get out of the shower.
7204 2018-08-04 22:38:06 Lmao the guy told my me oil change would take 30 min.... that was at 4 O’CLOCK!!!!!!!!

7206 2018-08-04 22:37:50 Any type of oil. Soak in it in the bath. It will slide right off. I use baby or coconut! Bio oil also works 
7207 2018-08-04 22:37:24 Fish oil, creatine, 5htp, spring water, glycine + other amino acids, magnesium, zinc, vitamin D, fruits/veggies or a multivitamin. Cardio makes a difference too.

I want to hold off on steroids/gh at least for a while but the results for those speak for themselves.
7208 2018-08-04 22:37:08 What about the political donations coming from the US helping to keep our oil landlocked?
7209 2018-08-04 22:36:58 .@tferriss Your tip about oregano oil on #5BulletFriday is right on! I had a Greek handyman working at my home in #Austin tell me to make tea from oregano leaves growing right in my front yard to get rid of my cold. It works!
7210 2018-08-04 22:36:55 A woman with eyes like those lives vicariously only by choice.
7211 2018-08-04 22:36:20 Finally you talk
7212 2018-08-04 22:36:06 No. Russia has ordered Trump to drop the hawkish behavior because they recently started an oil-for-goods deal with Iran and they don't want the moron-in-chief messing it up.

YET ANOTHER EASILY DEBUNKED PILE OF NONSENSE FROM THE_TRUMP_TRAIN!
7213 2018-08-04 22:35:58 Karan Khans musafaray songs make me feel like I’m a 30 year old musafir working on an oil rig somewhere in Saudi and my wife’s back home in the village crying over my old photo Lmfaoo
7214 2018-08-04 22:35:52 I’ve been sitting here waiting for an oil change for 2 hours 
7215 2018-08-04 22:35:46 every now and then I have to oil my bicycle to keep the parts from wearing out. I hate upkeep costs. because they never end? i guess.
7216 2018-08-04 22:35:39 Tar sands?????. What century are you living in. The oil sands have not been called that for 35 years except for dinosaurs and crazy left wingers who apparently don’t use any oil related products

7228 2018-08-04 22:34:11 Dude, only stainless steel or pyrex glass. Not even nonstick baking sheets, etc.  Aaand, unlike how @rachaelray @RachaelRayShow does. Olive oil is not meant to be heated. Low smoke point. Carcinogen when heated.

7234 2018-08-04 22:32:05 Nah i don't use any oils but I hear good things about argan, tea tree and castor oil.
7235 2018-08-04 22:32:01 It was kind of entertaining watching 2 of them struggle to figure out our lanes Lol, I think they were used to lanes with more oil volume (less hook) since they're bowling balls were super strong

7237 2018-08-04 22:31:59 Preach brother preach
7238 2018-08-04 22:31:43 here's what you do: fry garlic and red pepper flakes in 1/4c olive oil, add a shitload of parmesan until melty, add 1c pasta water then add all the pasta, let it reduce and finish it with about 1tbsp of butter, some pepper, and parsley or basil or whatever
7239 2018-08-04 22:30:58 I dictate what he gets . Power oil or nothing

7244 2018-08-04 22:30:41 Talked to North Sea oil consultant only two days ago. He confirms the lie is a big one - the oil is far from running out. There are massive reserves to tap still.
7245 2018-08-04 22:30:32 Yeah I remember them laughing at people who were fooled into voting for them. Take a look at Joe Biden’s son that somehow is on the oil board of the government of Ukraine and you’ll find out why there’s a Russia phobia going on perhaps

7247 2018-08-04 22:30:18 PDP supporters here aren't intelligent. They still don't know that the crash in oil prices resulted in the recession + devaluation of the naira.....and the reason we couldn't defend the Naira during this recession was because the PDP administration had plundered the reserves
7248 2018-08-04 22:30:13 To delegitimize democracy and normalize violations of human rights. To accelerate global warming, which opens up vast Russian arctic territory and oil deposits. Oh... and validate his delusional ego through violence and control.
7249 2018-08-04 22:29:51 Everybody gets what they deserve in the in. Russia selling oil to North Korea and you smile in Putin's face. Selling American secrets,yes we know. The pit of fire is waiting for y'all in the after life  @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr
7250 2018-08-04 22:29:40 What’s worse than dropping a glass and breaking it? Dropping a glass bottle filled with olive oil and breaking it. 
7251 2018-08-04 22:29:29 Why does Trump want to ease auto mileage standards? More oil usage as a gift to oil companies. Lower quality autos as a gift to auto manufacturers. In other words, LOBBYIST RULE!

7265 2018-08-04 22:28:07 The US produces a majority of its own oil and most of the rest comes from Canada and Mexico.
7266 2018-08-04 22:28:07 Such a great finish! Was it Bobby Labonte that put all that oil on the track? Made for a wild finish
7267 2018-08-04 22:27:58 Antifa is some kind of special interest group paid to do this shit. They are dumb as shit too they prove they are fascist by trying to shut down the freedom of speech of others and they should be at a big oil ceo's house instead.

7275 2018-08-04 22:26:59 Stop being so civil. Call him the honorable member for Edom. Will he deny his origin?. Labour planned, supported and excuted and continue to support the ongoing GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra in Nigeria to steal oil and gas.
7276 2018-08-04 22:26:50 Crooked Don lies again they are making their own deals and reaping the benefits and money. They stopped get oil from USA and is now partners with Russia. So Crooked Don has made Russia great again
7277 2018-08-04 22:26:38 As I said. I'm on board with Nuclear. I'd prefer we master Fusion rather than continue to use Fission, and it's a lot more energy dense than oil so I'd love it if people weren't scared to death of the word Nuclear and we could have that, but we can't, because, environmentalism.
7278 2018-08-04 22:26:24 The other day me & my friends were discussing the same in fact we searched for detail regarding recycling machine which also makes different other products rather making only electricity!  Such as crude oil,  Even this idea can create jobs for native youth!!
7279 2018-08-04 22:26:24 I am looking for any women who are into getting together with me n do some beach wrestling or oil wrestling with if any women are interested please feel free to message me n lets plan something
7280 2018-08-04 22:26:23 It is not acceptable.
Fuel oil is their own somali ogeden,
they do not qualify for 5% to take,
7281 2018-08-04 22:26:20 Every time I go to the grocery store to buy cooking oil they have heaps on the shelves.  They have never fun out. Unlike the wind. It blows and then it stops. That’s because wind is finite. Scientist says that oil comes from fossils but the ones at the museum are always dry.
7282 2018-08-04 22:26:04 I swear I’m so thankful for my dad. He just called me to remind me that my truck and car need an oil change. To buy the oil and the filter and he will change it. Like I only understood half of what he was telling me tbh lol. I’m so glad he knows how to do all that.
7283 2018-08-04 22:25:59 Matthew, Saudis needs $85 to balance their books/deficit - high unemployment especially amongst the youth and a very generous social policy means they need a higher average price of oil than the current price.
7284 2018-08-04 22:25:47 Isn’t Jamaican black castor oil supposed to be for the beard
7285 2018-08-04 22:25:18 It doesn't have to be a drill. You're displaying a failure of imagination here. Maybe we'll invent the Flux Capacitor which allows us to extract every last molecule of crude oil from the ground on the entire planet, which would significantly increase our "known reserves".

7290 2018-08-04 22:24:09 Before we figured out we could chemically dissolve gold into a liquid solution and extract it from ore, we used a much more cumbersome process which likely left a bunch of gold unextracted. The same is true for out process of extracting oil out of the ground.
7291 2018-08-04 22:24:05 Me: [places potatoes in hot peanut oil]

6yo: What are you making, potato donuts!?
7292 2018-08-04 22:23:58 Thank you!
7293 2018-08-04 22:23:48 My dad changed my oil in my new car, cleaned out the air filter and radiator, took it to town and had new tires put on it, washed it, and then took that hideous Seahawks sticker off the back window. I’m pretty spoiled 
7294 2018-08-04 22:23:31 Oh and guess what? World powers might stop fighting over control of the Middle East. If no one wants oil, who will want that useless desert?

7296 2018-08-04 22:23:14 Can you explain why there is oil in the Arctic
7297 2018-08-04 22:23:05 While you may already know it well and use it, permit me nonetheless to recommend Holy Oil of St. Philomena. Our prayers you have.

7311 2018-08-04 22:19:29 Democrats’ odyssey to fully embrace neoliberalism with their entire being may have been a more meandering journey than for Republicans, but they made that journey nonetheless. See Obama’s full throated advocacy of his “all of the above” energy policy. Oil production exploded then

7318 2018-08-04 22:18:38 Curiously where I used to live — in Chacaíto, then Las Mercedes (about 20 yrs. before it became Caracas’ Brooklyn), Santa Inés, El Junko (technically part of Vargas, but in Caracas). It does suck now … because it sucked before, since the ‘50-‘80s, when oil firms robbed us blind.

7325 2018-08-04 22:17:59 Is THAT what the kids are callin' it?
7326 2018-08-04 22:17:51 That’s a stupid statement right?

Do socialist drive cars or eat food maybe wear clothes
or live in a building.

It all takes oil and lots of it.
World oil consumption is growing not declining.

7338 2018-08-04 22:15:57 Why expose Jail Ogaden only? Is it the only notorious jail in Ethiopia? Absolutely no. Then why only Ogaden? That is because there is oil there, and Team Lemma is after that oil in collaboration with their sponsor: Uncle Sam (aka USA).

7348 2018-08-04 22:14:57 follow the deals that POTUS has made with the EU in regards to Liquid Natural Gas.  He got the EU to agree to build 6-8 terminals to offload the Natural Gas and to buy it from the US. These terminals can offload oil too.  We are finding more gas and oil than we could ever use.
7349 2018-08-04 22:14:48 "If it's good enough to clean the oil off of baby geese in the ocean, why can't we use it on our hands?"

- my hubby on why he was putting Dawn dish soap in the empty handsoap container in our main bathroom

Now I know where our daughter gets it.
7350 2018-08-04 22:14:36 You're not taking into account new technologies which would allow us to extract whatever oil we weren't able to extract from previously "depleted" wells. This is why these predictions are always wrong, because people make them with respect to current technology.

7358 2018-08-04 22:12:41 I know what you're saying but the estimates of coal, oil, gas running out with our current supply is sometime within this century. We've dug into shale and tarsands. We can't keep digging. Most deposits of organic fossil fuel are from 50 to 220 million years old...1/2.
7359 2018-08-04 22:12:33 Aye I see you @Redmond2393 putting in that work man nice 2-0 over oil king 
7360 2018-08-04 22:12:25 I've twitter searched Hormuz and other possible keywords for Iran conducting drills around a important oil supply chokehold. Little to no chatter I could find. If we are preparing to spare would there be like a scif-like blackout of info in press and social media?

7368 2018-08-04 22:11:28 Never said I was an oil company. Never said I was drilling. Keep guessing. Only 10,000 more to go that's directly involved in the oil and gas industry. Good luck.
7369 2018-08-04 22:11:18 why does oil keep grinding higher and then steeply selling off followed by a drop further down in gold 
7370 2018-08-04 22:11:17 ويش يقصد
7371 2018-08-04 22:11:15 What about “I have an essential oil for that”? Kidding aside, tough post to write, I’m sure. Hard to be critical of good intentions, but empathy and compassion is something we must get right.

7384 2018-08-04 22:09:42 The flip side is that our already bulging public health budget (fastest growing budget area) will reach the point where not everyone can receive adequate care. Statins and insulin still in the top 10 most expensive drugs under PBS, better off putting olive oil on the PBS?

7389 2018-08-04 22:09:16 2015/16 crude oil produced from Scottish water 70 million tons. Scottish oil and gas sold on market that year £13.4b. 2015/16 Scotland produced 96% of UK crude and 60% of UK gas. But we get £24 million
7390 2018-08-04 22:09:09 But didn’t we lose Scarborough during Pnoy time. That s a fact. So far we didn’t lose any during Du30 time.  We are doing a JV for oil exploration w china/Asean. That a good economic opportunity. USA never offer us this kind of help.
7391 2018-08-04 22:09:03 Now Dems can investigate Pres Trump crushing China w/trade war to hide "collusion", while Dems collude w/Chinese spies, just like Deep State investigates Pres Trump crushing Russia w/oil war to hide "collusion", while Dems spy on Pres Trump+sell Uranium to Russia.  Dumb as rocks.
7392 2018-08-04 22:09:00 I mean, judging by the recipe, that is either butter or some other sort of grease (oil, shortening) because it asks you to rub the baking sheets with it, and it’s measured in grams so I’m going for butter or Shortening.

Hey... how long have those rigs been there?

7411 2018-08-04 22:06:52 @realDonaldTrump The United States of America should make a great trade deal with Iraq to build their economy and to help us lower oil prices. Why does it cost me $40 to fill up my car and $30 to change my oil.

7421 2018-08-04 22:05:20 If we don't build oil pipelines if won't significantly impact global oil use. More oil from countries where killing people who disagree with the mainstream views occurs. More Canadian oil revenue= more money to pay for the transition to a post oil world.
7422 2018-08-04 22:05:18 @IMSARadio The fire was more than likely from the oil lines.
7423 2018-08-04 22:05:07 So Ford makes it possible for you to sell beer cheaper, if you don't take him up on the offer he'll pay you to do it.

Next up for this sweet sweet deal? The struggling oil companies and 10cent cheaper gas...

Cheap Beer is just the lubrication for what comes next... #onpoli
7424 2018-08-04 22:05:05 Where did we hear similar savings lies previously? Oh yes, abbott when he murdered emissions trading scheme. Still waiting for that too. lnp, your lies are not working anymore. If we want snake oil you’re who we come too. For responsible government we’re forced to look elsewhere
7425 2018-08-04 22:04:57 Auto industry losing jobs and moving overseas. Farmers having to be bought out with welfare dollars of tax payer money. Deficit growing enormously. You have s history of bankruptcy. Trump University. Trump Steak. Trump Wine. Trump Airline. You’re a snake oil salesman and a liar.
7426 2018-08-04 22:04:48 I bet CIA is funding the havoc in #Jigjiga #Ethiopia because the oil contract has been given to a Chinese company. #Somalia #Kenya #SouthAfrica #Nigeria #Egypt #Eritrea
7427 2018-08-04 22:04:44 When life gives you lemons, cut them up, add garlic & rosemary & stuff it all into the chicken. Drizzle with oil & roast for 55 minutes on 425. Salt & pepper to taste.  

It’s delish.

7434 2018-08-04 22:03:41 Pakistan: At least 18 people killed, 35 others injured when a bus collided on with an oil tanker.

7438 2018-08-04 22:03:00 It’s not true that olive oil is good for polishing stainless steel, no matter what the internet says. Made a mess of my fridge... then my dogs licked  the yummy oil off so now I’ve got  slobber all over the freezer drawer.

7445 2018-08-04 22:02:29 I wont be asking for a majority , but a viable not pliable opposition that agrees when mandates and manifestos collide , not instead following the orders of an HQ that sees Scottish oil theft as the cheque book that buys English voters thus ermine for the few on the back of it.
7446 2018-08-04 22:02:25 If I break your heart, na Oil Spillage 
7447 2018-08-04 22:02:23 Maybe we'll just play with candles.

Candles are romantic.....
7448 2018-08-04 22:01:56 Charm is overrated comes across as smarmy. I prefer confident and masculine
7449 2018-08-04 22:01:19 I certainly hope you meet, have a nice chat after a whitehouse dinner. Discuss the future of energy and the true value of oil,  they are going to need a friend and we can use some more influence in the region
7450 2018-08-04 22:01:09 We will treat everyone living, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
7451 2018-08-04 22:01:01 I didn’t do everything I had planned on doing today but I did pick up my “undeliverable” package from fedex, got my oil change and inspection sticker, went to target, and did my grocery shopping. Still need to get my hair cut though
7452 2018-08-04 22:00:50 Treated my vape to CBD oil (I say I treated my vape, but I was really treating myself )
7453 2018-08-04 22:00:28 With garlic and olive oil, after fresh tomato sauce and parmesan.
7454 2018-08-04 22:00:25 trying 2 avoid going & getting an oil change by posting old selfies......classic

7457 2018-08-04 22:00:13 They have no choice but to meet and make a deal that is in our best  interest.They can not drink or eat their oil.Even Saudi Arabia wants them to stop starting trouble all over the middle east.
7458 2018-08-04 22:00:12 If we could unlock our oil in Alberta and sell it on the world or domestic market wouldn't it be great.   I'm in favour of  alternate power, the world is still a long way from that.  So, fossil fuels are still required.  Why are Canadians inhibiting the flow
7459 2018-08-04 22:00:03 You found oil of etherealness. #DnD #ADnD
7460 2018-08-04 21:59:56 Oil is a mineral that, like water and gold, there is a infinite supply of.

7472 2018-08-04 21:58:31 Groupon is my best friend for oil changes
7473 2018-08-04 21:58:23 Trump definitely has betrayed America. He threw America under the bus on live TV in Helsinki for his precious Putin & the whole world saw it. I would be angry if Hillary or Obama betrayed my country. I always choose my country over any individual or party. Trigger you? What for?
7474 2018-08-04 21:58:17 Crude oil makes up most U.S. energy imports from Canada, averaging 3.3 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2016. Canada is by far the largest source of U.S. crude oil imports, providing 41% of total U.S. crude oil imports in 2016.
7475 2018-08-04 21:57:55 That makes sense to me. Nobody understands how Obama’s oil and energy executive orders impacted all the smaller companies that support the industry. The piping, water, gravel, semi truck drivers and the list goes on and on.
7476 2018-08-04 21:57:52 Same as tanning oil...
7477 2018-08-04 21:57:05 All revenues aren't.
And it is £ billions, averaging around £6bn pa since oil began flowing 1980.
(Oil not processed through Scotland is assigned to 'Unknown region' in UK accounts).

7483 2018-08-04 21:56:23 Nuclear Armageddon because they were fighting over oil and then water.
7484 2018-08-04 21:56:10 It's all about quality not quantity. That's coming from someone who has had chronic terminal insomnia for decades. CBD oil can be useful
7485 2018-08-04 21:56:05 Have a olive oil hot oil treatment in my hair, watching movies in bed I’m just trying to relax till i have to run out later to meet this girl to give her this last minute order
7486 2018-08-04 21:56:02 I already tried that. =P
7487 2018-08-04 21:55:58 In principle, yes, there is a finite amount of oil in the ground. In practice, as our technology improves we gain the ability to tap and extract every last drop of oil we were previously unable to get. We can drill deeper, cheaper, pump out more, we can tap shale oil, etc.
7488 2018-08-04 21:55:45 Not on a man, honestly the only guys I know that put lotion or oil on themselves are gay guys and chip n dales.
7489 2018-08-04 21:55:31 How is Norway's welfare state sustainable? EXPORTS; oil $26 billion/yr, farms 65% of the world's fish, provides hydro-electric to Denmark & Sweden + strict immigration policy + 25% sales tax + only 5 million people in the country.
7490 2018-08-04 21:55:25 my coconut oil is a pot of liquid at this point, fecking 
7491 2018-08-04 21:55:24 I didn’t end up being able to get tickets for the #criticalrole signing so I stayed away from Lucas oil stadium until after 4 but the signing is still going and now I regretti not being able to get signing tickets because they’re literally all there :(

7495 2018-08-04 21:54:18 Bingo. He doesn't have a clue what  "cognitive bias" & "illusory truth" mean, and certainly doesn't recognize the truth, but knows how to sell the lies. People have always gone for snake oil.
7496 2018-08-04 21:54:17 Me at Valvoline: hi yeah I just need an oil change today, nothing else 

Worker: okay well it looks like you will also need a new air filter, tires rotated, a fuel treatment, or ur car will explode in 7 days 

Me: yeah I'm just gonna go with the oil change thank u!!!!
7497 2018-08-04 21:53:53 I look forward to your video posts of your progress.
7498 2018-08-04 21:53:45 Yes. He's a snake oil salesman for the Republican party.

7500 2018-08-04 21:53:40 Norway... so I can start collecting monthly salary from Oil proceeds 
7501 2018-08-04 21:53:29 It's you, Margaret hodge and the politicians who went to war in Iraq, thus destabilising the Middle East, in order to secure cheap oil.
7502 2018-08-04 21:53:05 Cooking dinner, and after I poured my tbs of olive oil, I told the other spices it was a wrap for olive oil. I then asked them to applaud while I put it away.
7503 2018-08-04 21:53:03 Nah that’s an autumn marrow vibe there chief. Onion, garlic, squash pulp and red pepper all fried up in olive oil then added to the couscous with harissa and a fuckton if lemon zest and some feta crumbled in for good measure if you’re feeling that way inclined before baking
7504 2018-08-04 21:53:00 @iamrationale OIL AND WATER IS PLAYING IN THE STARBUCKS IM AT AND I AM LIVING

7508 2018-08-04 21:52:09 Thank you for that GIF!
7509 2018-08-04 21:51:52 Well, sure, they had oil Iraq wanted. That's fair, oil is delicious.
7510 2018-08-04 21:51:50 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong.
7511 2018-08-04 21:51:48 I'd guess olive oil would work just fine!
7512 2018-08-04 21:51:27 I should’ve packed my CBD Oil  #stressed #anxiety
7513 2018-08-04 21:51:13 Radical thought: we could let purchasers of oil in Canada to buy from wherever they can get the lowest cost and we could let Canadian producers sell to whatever markets they can access for the best prices they can get. 

1/2
7514 2018-08-04 21:50:39 A lot of your fellow Iranians would disagree with the fact that many Iranians are unable to access running water and electricity and yet they sit on some of the largest oil reserves in the world
7515 2018-08-04 21:50:31 Civilization is a heroin addict yet will condemn a #heroinaddict because the oil is the root.

It has black eyed peas, couple jalapeños, cilantro, colored bell peppers, corn, jicama, salt/pepper, lime juice, olive oil, white wine vinegar dressing tossed with everything. It’s really yummy.
7517 2018-08-04 21:50:26 Ugh it’s always something....... went in for a oil change and now I gotta pay all this money to get all this other shit fixed 
7518 2018-08-04 21:50:15 My boyfriend started the day by saying, "we're going on an adventure today!" I think how fun! Will we go to the beach or Disneyland? Then he says, "first we'll get an oil change & do laundry, maybe see a film if we're not tired." Now, how can he be confused by my frustration?
7519 2018-08-04 21:50:14 Carney should be more worried about the 2030 date of semi electric cars undermining the oil run economy. ??Carney suckles of the teat of soros and rothschilds??. So far his predictions have been closer to a fair ground palm reader, And lets not mention the IMF and their spiel

7533 2018-08-04 21:47:47 And oil. Lots of oil. That's why I rarely make fried food at home. Seeing all of that oil there's no way to fool myself that it's not *that* bad for me.
7534 2018-08-04 21:47:36 When you wanna take your other car to save money and gas cause you broke as fuck but your dad hasn’t been taking care of the car. Like driving with no oil 
7535 2018-08-04 21:47:33 It is just few Hayenas who are scavenging for oil. Before anything else, all Ethiopians should be asked to pledge allegiance to #Ethiopia. State/region issues come next.

7549 2018-08-04 21:45:58 That is frigging awesome!
7550 2018-08-04 21:45:54 Prayers from a fake Christian are meaningless. Due to Twitter's limited use of characters punctuation must be sacrificed at times. When you conspire with a hostile foreign enemy to steal an election you are a traitor. Why aren't you angry at Trump's betrayal of America? Traitor!

7556 2018-08-04 21:45:10 No, par boil spuds and roast in oven for 40 mins. The sauce is garlic sweated in olive oil. Add a table spoon of sweet paprika and a teaspoon of hot paprika, splash of sherry vinegar and dash of honey. Drizzle and reheat in oven. It’s yummy
7557 2018-08-04 21:45:08 1. Always use green herbs 
2. You can infuse oils with any herb / peppers garlic ... Get creative and put top oil in clear bottle ... 
Thank you for following !
7558 2018-08-04 21:45:00 WTF is wrong with you? Reading comprehension is not your strong suit. No such thing as oil barons anymore. I make my living in the oil and gas industry. And it has gotten much better under Trump. What do you do, besides bitch about other countries President??
7559 2018-08-04 21:44:50 The divisions were always there.    Opportunists like Murdoch, Levant and others just capitalized on those divisions and gave voice to the intolerant. Had they been born in another time they would be traveling around in wagons selling snake oil.
7560 2018-08-04 21:44:50 Super easy ginger dressing just like the Japanese steak houses....3 ingredients....blend in mixer and serve.
2 ounces pickled sushi ginger
1/4 cup toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon soy sauce
7561 2018-08-04 21:44:40 I know that you're not foolish. You're not like those women in the bible that didn't take oil with them for their lanterns....
7562 2018-08-04 21:44:30 isn't that the black oil that eats Tasha Yar?
7563 2018-08-04 21:44:22 wait did she use their wake and bake oil with the foundation? my friend has dry skin and she used it along with her cake mix and she liked it
7564 2018-08-04 21:44:12 Who in the world would give you their company name so you can trash it on social media. Nobody is that stupid. You don’t have to be an oil kingpin to benefit from real jobs not minimum wage jobs being created. That has what’s been going on over the last 12 months
7565 2018-08-04 21:44:07 last night a dude from Cali was talking about how weed is legal there , then in extreme confidence some chick goes , “ aww lucky , you can only do CBC oil here “ . . . C. B. C. oil ?! 
7566 2018-08-04 21:44:04 Haaay hay hay,  leave her ntwana , bby oil and petroleum jelly are expensive kulamalanga.
7567 2018-08-04 21:44:04 Oh right, so why did they revise their Scot oil revenue for 2015/16 after producing their "estimate"? Can you explain why Norway took £17b in revenues but UK took £240m in 2015/16 both areas producing approx. same amount of oil?
7568 2018-08-04 21:43:48 Olive oil is usually specified as 'virgin olive oil,' and that makes me wonder about possible subtext in Popeye cartoons ...that I missed when I was watching it as a child.
7569 2018-08-04 21:43:28 That’s too bad, I don’t know anyone that hasn’t seen a positive change, from retail, construction, manufacturing and oil and gas. It’s been nuts... I can’t hire ppl fast enough
7570 2018-08-04 21:43:14 yet it is working. European countries have already announced they are lowering tarrifs on US gas, oil & soy bean products so far.
7571 2018-08-04 21:43:00 Lol he has an oil leak in the car so he's coming all the way back home to get his dad's suv just to go baCK out ((((: that's such a waste of gas but men only do  what they want  without  logic
7572 2018-08-04 21:42:50 essential oil pyramid scheme: coming soon to an organic white mom near u
7573 2018-08-04 21:42:47 I'm officially too damn tired to sleep so let me tell you about the oil cleanse I gave my face the other day.
My face looks full of what the internet says probably isn't blackheads. But they look like them. Mostly my nose and chin. 
The other day I had severe dry skin. 1/?

7575 2018-08-04 21:42:36 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
7576 2018-08-04 21:42:35 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7577 2018-08-04 21:41:53 Could well be long oil, if Iran  disrupts the flow through the Straits of Hormuz - 04/11 is D day for US sanctions; India already looking for other sources....

The other is drinking some #OldMonk rum on the rocks 
7580 2018-08-04 21:41:44 I vaguely remember my mom had an oil, not sunscreen, which just made us greasy.
7581 2018-08-04 21:41:39 Allowing oil drilling in parks denies global warming and the building and use of the Dakota pipeline
7582 2018-08-04 21:41:23 The GOP is owned by oil coal and gas. They would rather kill everyone on the planet than lose one penny.

あ、昨日どりーまの告知したのでみてください
7584 2018-08-04 21:40:57 Yes loads!! 4 x Pitbull, numerous USA senior officers in Afghanistan that are widowed with one child, plus the guys working in the oil industry, widowed and looking to find their next wife!
7585 2018-08-04 21:40:51 The son that when the actor changed was explained away as an accident on an oil rig and a plastic surgeon had to rebuild his face. The bandage removal reveal was brilliant. 
7586 2018-08-04 21:40:46 "or death". 

Your friend thinks free markets are bad because it brought us oil and telephones, and the companies that did it supplied everyone who wanted it. They should have refused half their customers then it would be ok the rest could keep using whale oil. #twilightzone
7587 2018-08-04 21:40:24 studies confirm that that once Mr. Drumpf has a toddler tantrum, a sane person subscibes to the #NYT

7590 2018-08-04 21:40:03 When you're packing, ensure you drain the oil and gas from your lawn equipment!

This will help prevent spills during your move and let's face it: the lighter you can make everything, the easier it is to move!

7593 2018-08-04 21:39:52 Oh right, you’re an oil baron  Of course you are.
7594 2018-08-04 21:39:46 Please take note: Trump's objective here is to help people that have and continue to grow thier wealthy through the gas and oil industries  at the health and expense of the rest of us Americans.

7597 2018-08-04 21:38:59 CHECK UR OIL!!
7598 2018-08-04 21:38:58 Shale oil extraction and conventional oil extraction;the former,is funded by short term small capital for a few bucks return; the latter,need be funded by long term huge capital investments.Perversely Wall Street only went for the former,cheap selling US crude for a quick profit.
7599 2018-08-04 21:38:44 When did “they” steal your oil and when did “they” steal Palestine exactly?
7600 2018-08-04 21:38:36 MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR OIL WHEN BUYING A BRAND NEW HYUNDAI!!! MINE HAD 11 MILES ON IT AND BROKE DOWN NO OIL!!
7601 2018-08-04 21:38:29 I just saw an adorable 2 year old dressed as John Constantine laying on the floor in Lucas Oil Stadium and he has CLEARLY “had it” today. Do NOT tell me #GenCon isn’t a magical time of year.

7604 2018-08-04 21:37:19 It must be like living with an oil slick. All slippery & disgusting. The thought of it makes me fill ill. Presumably, she didn't brief the media first?
7605 2018-08-04 21:37:17 it’s way too hot to be changing the oil in my dads truck
7606 2018-08-04 21:37:16 I am a robot. I piss oil
7607 2018-08-04 21:37:14 Thanks Tom. To Clarify what I'm looking for would be birch or other plywood or other thin sheets of wood. I cure wood panels for painting oil portraits and scenes. I'm also interested in raw wood to make river tables out of using blue tinted resins.
7608 2018-08-04 21:37:06 Great for oil & gas companies - and that's all that counts. Right? I won't be buying that new car in a couple of years. My current 2002 model already gets 32.5 mpg and is equipped with a catalytic converter - cause it met California standards.

7610 2018-08-04 21:36:36 Uhh...that's the death toll of authoritarianism. Ask someone in the Middle East if capitalism has a death toll when its digging for oil to fuel it.
7611 2018-08-04 21:36:36 @realDonaldTrump President Trump Should Add more Itemes to Iran Sanction Ayatolahs Water Export. price of water is 4 times more than oil and Flights From Iran For Narcotic Smuggling by name of VIP GOODS to their Embassies all around The world
7612 2018-08-04 21:36:32 What do you believe to be the best oil for seasoning?
7613 2018-08-04 21:36:25 Ive had an idea Heid about raising more funds for charity and when you finally remove you're #UKOG T-Shirt . It involve Pingos favourite subject water. PS no need to tell Eddie yet.
7614 2018-08-04 21:36:24 Maybe Andrea should’ve kept his mouth shut but those saying we’re skint need to get a grip. Guy has pumped millions into our club. We ain’t oil rich. If the owner thought a potential £10 mil sale made sense then believe and trust his judgement. #lufc #mot
7615 2018-08-04 21:36:17 We knew tobacco causes cancer in the 1890s.
We knew lead in gasoline was toxic before they started adding it in the 1920s.
Oil and car companies fought the Clean air & Water Act for decades.
We knew CFCs damaged the ozone for decades before DuPont gave in.

Capitalism kills.
7616 2018-08-04 21:36:08 I'm not sure that's an authentic Arabian move....
7617 2018-08-04 21:36:07 “We”
7618 2018-08-04 21:36:01 That's a fantastic idea 
7619 2018-08-04 21:35:50 British ended slavery with Wilberforce in 1807.  Fascism still kills people - although the fascists call themselves Antifa, Hope Not Hate, Momentum, Democrats and @UKLabour these days.  Oil has been a net benefit, and if you're on the global warming bandwagon you're dumb as rocks
7620 2018-08-04 21:35:45 that must be difficult for you - can you get coconut oil?
7621 2018-08-04 21:35:38 If they used a new chain reaction I invented they can stop the oil and follow sustainable development in every community with a Root&Branch infrastructure that protects from flood and droughts while acting as an energy storage and water and air scrubbing plant.
7622 2018-08-04 21:35:37 Truth is like an oil no matter the level of water You poured on it, it will float.
7623 2018-08-04 21:35:32 Oil will skyrocket. Thanks low IQ

7630 2018-08-04 21:34:03 This is how much oil we imported per day only 8000 Barrels. We Export?? More than what we need 2400 barrels a day. And  NG we export per month 275,000  Million Cubic Feet. Middle east is not a big deal anymore for the US.
7631 2018-08-04 21:34:00 Today they've agreed that pulling crowds is owning a state, the day we lock down Kano, they'll say "Crowds to not translate to votes" 
7632 2018-08-04 21:33:47 Without oil? So no chance of a decent convo

7634 2018-08-04 21:33:41 Sorry, why do we have a Border security Minister??? 
Kinda like gearing up with equipment, people, resources and engineering for an oil pipeline

7639 2018-08-04 21:32:44 But the US *started* this mess with a regime change in Iran. (for oil, of course.)
Can you trust them in the slightest, whatever their intent, not to muck things up again?
7640 2018-08-04 21:32:39 And honestly I think data is more than Oil, because Oil affected some value chains while Data sounds like affecting much more value chains! So, it’s unfair to say Data is the new Oil, actually Data is much more than Oil!
7641 2018-08-04 21:32:11 Shut up go get ur arab parents to get one with their oil money smh
7642 2018-08-04 21:32:06 Okay.  Fill a bathtub full of water, pour a cap full of canola oil, wait an hour or two and see if it stays in/near the place you poured it in.
7643 2018-08-04 21:31:33 おっはー！！
7644 2018-08-04 21:31:25 The Subsidy on crude oil products has not be 100% removed by FG. successful Gov. Have been going about it gradually in part to cushion the effect of drastic withdrawal on the economy and populace and also not to attract severe resistance from the people.
7645 2018-08-04 21:31:18 Hadn't thought of it that way....   
7646 2018-08-04 21:31:03 For all the vegans that often can’t eat the naan bread from their local takeaway - mix 1.25 cups of flour with adequate water and salt, mould into a dough, flatten it out and fry without oil. That’s 2 naans, taste great

7653 2018-08-04 21:30:31 Just out of curiosity, how do you feel about our leaders continually using the likes of Dietz to guard and go after the oil reserves, and other profitable resources, of sovereign nations?
7654 2018-08-04 21:30:30 I don’t think they understand financial fair play, the new stadium- inflation/Brexit, homegrown players stipulations, Poch’s own criteria of player selection or the reinvestment Spurs do in Tottenham and beyond. They’d rather oil money from modern day slavers just to win a cup.
7655 2018-08-04 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
7656 2018-08-04 21:30:10 2 Cups baking soda
1 Cup salt
1/2 Cup water
1/3 Cup liquid castile soap
2 Teaspoons Thieves essential oil(about 40 drops)

Combine all ingredients to make a paste and form it into teaspoon-sized tablets. Place on a cookie sheet and let harden overnight. Drop on as needed.
7657 2018-08-04 21:29:57 Any Lady who doesn't know how to Cook oil rice doesn't like washing her panties
7658 2018-08-04 21:29:46 No, the Iranian people don't want another US-backed puppet Dictator for life, like your Dad the Shah, thanks @PahlaviReza. They don't want to be enslaved by the Saudis, Israel & the US over oil and imperialism.
What has the US promised you, @PahlaviReza? Hands off sovereign #Iran
7659 2018-08-04 21:29:40 We may need another oil hedge,  this time let's ensure the premium of the call options contract is less that, what we paid the last time.
7660 2018-08-04 21:29:36 Apply olive oil 10 mins before shampoo, then apply after. Make sure you apply the oil daily. You don't need to wash baby's hair daily though. Could dry the scalp. It takes a while to get rid of it completely so be patient.
7661 2018-08-04 21:29:30 What do you cook the pancakes in? Oil or lard?
7662 2018-08-04 21:29:29 She can always get matched at Riley Rose stores. It’s harder for those who order online bc it is still everyone’s best guess. Also if they have dry skin, oil or slip work well underneath any matte foundation. So happy you were passionate about Helping her.
7663 2018-08-04 21:29:19 i spilled my hair oil on my door and I tried to get it up but iont think I did a good job because time from time I be sliding when im walking in my room scaring tf outta me lmao 
7664 2018-08-04 21:29:16 And place some cardboard underneath it to catch the oil.
7665 2018-08-04 21:29:02 higher tariffs on imported steel and aluminum will harm the automotive industry and construction, which are big employers.  NAFTA renegotiation proposals – would still tilt the rules toward big oil, gas and pharmaceutical companies over consumers, citizens and the environment.
7666 2018-08-04 21:28:51 I didn’t realize supporting a guy who does great things for his community is an attack on Trump.
7667 2018-08-04 21:28:37 Sebaceous hyperplasia is genetic.  It leads to acne and oil bumps as you age.  It’s common enough that white folks have it.
7668 2018-08-04 21:28:12 I got a oil change
7669 2018-08-04 21:28:03 I 100% support your wish for regime change, but please do not ask the US to play a role in it. Before you know it, they own all your oil, have military bases everywhere, and destabilized the country. Just look at the successes in Iraq and Afghanistan.
7670 2018-08-04 21:28:02 Add bacon to fries’ oil for better flavor

7676 2018-08-04 21:27:30 Looks like a modern oil painting.
7677 2018-08-04 21:27:28 OH: “the amount of snake oil being marketed at cloud conferences is off the charts. it feels like every damn company doing anything at all in the infrastructure/“cloud” space needs a mandatory presence. To me they all look like zebra stripes - pretty much indistinguishable.”
7678 2018-08-04 21:27:28 It’s off a direct-drive turbine engine - likely an Allison. These, unlike the free-turbine type, do not default to feather with the oil pressure released. When shut down, the blades go to fine pitch. If you’re accustomed to Pratt turboprops, it’s opposite.
7679 2018-08-04 21:27:27 "They're very easy."

We prefer to think of it as "widely accepting."
7680 2018-08-04 21:27:05 For decades over, they thrive off oil.
7681 2018-08-04 21:27:00 Economy better. My bank account is proof. Job killing regs, gone. Hiring is up. Wages up. The industry I'm in alone proves that. Can't find enough workers for 30$ an hour plus daily per diem. Anwar open for drilling. . New oil leases signed. Rig count up.Just a few. I'm happy
7682 2018-08-04 21:26:51 Wow that 1 we buy in Lagos airport around 12 k is just 6 k
7683 2018-08-04 21:26:51 Something’s up , bet their burning the midnight oil shredding and covering up
7684 2018-08-04 21:26:32 @lisadavidms  Flaxseed oil, has also been called "Seeds of Hope" necessary for Growth & Development as of it's Omega-3's that cannot be made by the body, as Omega 3 fatty acids have been known to help in immune dysfunction and Depression, It's Worth Trying.
7685 2018-08-04 21:26:03 The verse/grammar translation varies, i.e. some translate as “rose-like coloured (burnt) oil” so not literally yellow oil

7688 2018-08-04 21:25:24 my dad does this with oil and vinegar all the time and sometimes adds cucumbers
7689 2018-08-04 21:25:14 Thanks bro!! The secret is the insanely high priced expensive manly scented oil’s and lotions :-)
7690 2018-08-04 21:25:13 Would you like me to check the oil too?
7691 2018-08-04 21:25:06 They are more feminine in appearance, and it's nice to be able to get a hand underneath!
7692 2018-08-04 21:25:02 For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord sends rain on the land.

Nonsense-it's simple. We're overly dependent on oil for Revenue to balance the loss of the economic benefits of being in the UK. Those benefits currently enable us to spend what we NEED to spend on more expensive per capita public services. That impact's £10b a year >>

7749 2018-08-04 21:16:12 Personally, I supported Lucas Oil Stadium. 

However, I think more and more people are realizing that not only will they have to pay higher taxes for the stadium, but ticket prices will also go up.

7827 2018-08-04 21:04:55 I too could "cherry pick". Fact is Alberta and Sask were crushed by these policies. The US now exports oil due to fracking.

7828 2018-08-04 21:04:49 What is Israel going to do - bomb the ships that have been sunk? Watch out for those S300's.

7829 2018-08-04 21:04:05 By the time this pipeline is built whether AB's like it or not oil will not be valued as it is today renewable energy is coming which will gladly take pricing power away from the oil cartels.

7833 2018-08-04 21:03:45 I’m listening to a podcast about CBD oil and it’s making me more anxious, because that stuff doesn’t work for me. Also marijuana makes me paranoid. My brain has the dumbest chemicals.
7834 2018-08-04 21:03:41 Whether you like it or not,there are angels God use on this app to bless us,I have met 2 today ...
Alhamdulillah, be careful how you mingle.

7842 2018-08-04 21:02:31 our economy must change due to climate change,  ... transport of. goods, the practice of oil based fertilizes, and the entire food chain system, and oil in general. no threads on this
7843 2018-08-04 21:02:24 Take biotin and look up Castro oil I heard that helps hair growth. I haven’t tried it tho 
7844 2018-08-04 21:02:20 I'm going to explain again. "Rationing' isn't related to "expensive". Electricity is expensive because we don't have big oil and gas reserves. We mostly buy it from other countries. We are rapidly improving on our renewables so we know things will get better.

7852 2018-08-04 21:01:21 Speaking to someone pretty high up in oil & gas field. On the finance side. Actually made rather a lot of money in another. He said the best thing that happened is the oil price fall. It pushed technology & cut wages to a realistic point. He is very confident it has great future.
7853 2018-08-04 21:01:16 America has backed out of its agreement with Iran, and now expects the rest of the world not to buy its oil. Iran is the regiona power, and Israel has for many many years wanted America to attack Iran to take the position of regional power. Iran is just reacting to the threat!
7854 2018-08-04 21:01:11 Ayyyy hows oil club going do u like it when your a plastic club
7855 2018-08-04 21:00:49 Do not trust @younglivingeo. We had rewards for free oils, placed our order and was told I would only need to pay shipping. Later was charged for oil. I’m on a fixed income and this is not ok!
7856 2018-08-04 21:00:31 What can you do but make things worse? On the campaign trail, you made fun of Kasich, "He got lucky because he struck oil," remember. You demented toad. Your time's about up.

Do you think scots are wrong to want to run thier own country?

7873 2018-08-04 20:58:39 United States steel said they aren't opening 6 new plants.  Made up facts sound good reality doesn't so our snake oil salesman makes up facts to sell his message.
7874 2018-08-04 20:58:38 It sure is! I use avocado oil with anything I cook, it’s a very light oil. It’s sooo good for you’

7880 2018-08-04 20:57:37 We sent her a report on how to reduce the tarsands extraction emissions a month ago and no response so far. It is not possible to replace the tarsands extraction process with green power because it is a huge energy cost - sometimes as much as the energy derived from the final oil
7881 2018-08-04 20:57:35 Hey Dumba$$, it’s your fault pulling out of the Iran deal!! No wonder our gas and oil going up big time! You run your mouth to much!! Oh did you say Happy Birthday to the real President Obama? I think you didn’t!! Shame on you
7882 2018-08-04 20:56:55 You know what that means!!! That entire increase is due to the rise in oil prices!!!! Quit making up bullshit success stories and tell it like it is you won't be getting re-elected anyways!!!#LiberalLogic
7883 2018-08-04 20:56:51 Pure grapefruit essential oil is everything. 
7884 2018-08-04 20:56:37 Milk usually helped mine, and I'm told olive oil does too, but not so sure how that works. Won't hurt to try if she seems uncomfortable.

7887 2018-08-04 20:56:05 You mean you screwed up the Iran deal which in turn caused them to act out and block oil deliveries so then our gas prices increased. Now you have to fix a crisis you created. Why should they trust you?!
7888 2018-08-04 20:55:24 APC is simply too crude an organisation to lead any nation

7890 2018-08-04 20:55:07 Actually, if Jill genuinely cared about the environment, she wouldn't have joined the chorus of liars vilifying Hillary. Jill said Hillary and Trump were the same. Instead of 500 million solar panels going in we have GREATER reliance on oil and coal. Nice work saving the earth!
7891 2018-08-04 20:55:06 Perfectly explained!

Meg- “oh well your a boujee bitch.”
7894 2018-08-04 20:54:45 Open your mind. New Canadian pipelines CAN help. They displace oil produced elsewhere,  reduce the need to transport oil by rail, and allow more money to stay in Canada to be used to finance the transition to a post oil world.
7895 2018-08-04 20:54:43 Business confidence wouldn't be low because they have been hammered with more costs, uncertain future after seeing oil/gas/coal/steel given the boot, dairy herds slaughtered with talk of not allowed to restock to same levels and slow compensation, orchards being cut down, etc

7916 2018-08-04 20:50:43 Most of that capacity was replaced with methane from fracking oil fields. It’s possibly a net win, but not so much as it appears at first blush.

7919 2018-08-04 20:49:43 Yup, your a regular Einstein. Then please explain the mass exodus of oil and gas investments that have left since #thelibtards have been in power. And why is th US economy flourishing well ahead of Canada’s? Bye bye done wasting my time with a asshole arrogant Quebecor. #fucktard
7920 2018-08-04 20:49:40 Why keep taking it then? Why award new licences? Why does London ask oil companies to register in London or overseas so that Scotland cant claim any revenues? Why do you hate the idea of your country not being dependant on another? & by a government we don't vote for?

7922 2018-08-04 20:49:33 The TMX pipeline has potential to be a great investment. I supported #EnergyEast more but #TMX is still better than no pipeline capacity increases. Displace oil from countries that support human rights abuses

7932 2018-08-04 20:48:45 It also stupid because everything that lives or has ever lived is 'organic' including crude oil and as your say, pesticides such as DDT. Every kind of farming is 'organic'
They should just have a better name for it. Call it 'environmentally friendly' farming or 'eco-farming'.

7970 2018-08-04 20:41:42 It's important to keep historical perspective in mind. If it weren't for the wealth of coal and oil that allowed us to turn machines into our slaves, human slavery would still be a thriving institution.
7971 2018-08-04 20:41:22 We are not energy independent. We still import oil.
7972 2018-08-04 20:41:18 He signed multiple for Alaska, Gulf of Mexico along with multiple other environmental ones which impacted our oil industry along with multiple ones around coal which have been reversed.
7973 2018-08-04 20:41:06 you gotta keep China out of the middle east.  They are there to defend their interest in Iranian oil.
7974 2018-08-04 20:40:47 It's amazing how many people my age don't know how to do basic shit to their vehicles like checking oil checking/putting air in tires
7975 2018-08-04 20:40:45 Depends on the books and the club.  lol
7976 2018-08-04 20:40:40 I feel like at least one of those pics could be an oil painting
7977 2018-08-04 20:40:35 والنبي احلا اكله في الصيف كله
7978 2018-08-04 20:40:30 changed my own oil.....not bad for a girl with no talent
7979 2018-08-04 20:40:30 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
7980 2018-08-04 20:40:27 I dont need highlight.

I already have a natural highlight.

It's called acne oil
7981 2018-08-04 20:40:22 One mighty fine peice of driving right there. Way to go Rico! Good luck tonight and the rest of the week @Rico_Abreu
7982 2018-08-04 20:40:10 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.

7984 2018-08-04 20:40:08 Those of you who didn’t let us say ‘oil rice’ in peace, I hope you’re happy in life
7985 2018-08-04 20:40:08 Did Venezuela collapse merely due to low oil prices, or would it have pulled through even if oil prices remained high at $130 or even if it increased further? What triggered the collapse of what was once South America's strongest economy?

A rather long overdue thread.
7986 2018-08-04 20:39:37 I accidentally poured hot fry oil on my finger, at work, yesterday
7987 2018-08-04 20:39:25 Very well said.
7988 2018-08-04 20:39:21 Damn. I saw in one variation there was cuticle oil. Would be great if Boxy added some nail stuff! Holo top coats would be awesome! Boggles the mind to see a face painted so well and then look down and see naked and unkept hands.
7989 2018-08-04 20:39:18 I dunno if that's oil or the makings of a beard on his face!
7990 2018-08-04 20:39:18 Guess who got oil 
7991 2018-08-04 20:39:08 he injeced oil into his muscles to make them look bigger
7992 2018-08-04 20:38:53 I using your company's headache relief essential oil as we speak! Works wonders! Thanks so much for making quality products I can trust!
7993 2018-08-04 20:38:52 Gotta think the short Oil trade is coming soon. U.S. needs to ramp up domestic production like now - just cost $46 to fill up my 4 series, that's ridiculous. Now granted I use 93 octane but when I got this ride 2 summer's ago - was like $30 to fill it up.
7994 2018-08-04 20:38:37 Getting my breaks fixed, putting on new tires cuz it’s fckn bald already & oil change, feels good to not worry anymore but anyone like buy one car now? 
7995 2018-08-04 20:38:32 If you want to go deeper, USA was built with blood and oil. Rockefeller, Carnegie, etc. You know them?
7996 2018-08-04 20:38:27 The playing field in media has never been level when it comes to race - ethnic minorities are underrepresented. This traineeship is trying to rectify that. Are you seriously complaining about that?
7997 2018-08-04 20:38:20 I havent heard of any MHRA approved CBD oil. So that was the first thing.
7998 2018-08-04 20:38:17 Just don't ask him to heal the oceans from oil spills #AboveObamasPayGrade
7999 2018-08-04 20:38:16 Hey queens, u shld try tonight, apply some coconut oil on ur lips, some of us that had black dry lips can now flaunt fine lips, fine, full n soft. Nite!!!
8000 2018-08-04 20:38:11 I’ve been doing it non-traditionally with lime zest/juice added to the oil/vinegar. Love lime with basil & tomatoes.
8001 2018-08-04 20:38:08 Castor oil quickens the growth process for hair generally...
8002 2018-08-04 20:38:06 That means that you just gotta put some moisturizer in it, I suggest pure natural things that will strengthen it like coconut oil or something. I hope this helped
8003 2018-08-04 20:38:05  What?! Wait! 

8004 2018-08-04 20:37:59 Use the harvest to produce Ethan and put up cooperation for production! Perfect fuel for cars and it will higher GDP, because it lower all oil import from the Arabs!
8005 2018-08-04 20:37:56 our souls are made of energy his energy resembles actual shit and old oil like a sludge stagnant in a river killing and blocking the flow .
8006 2018-08-04 20:37:46 When I was a landscaper we sprayed castor oil on the lawns, keeps the moles away a natural and humane way. You could try that!
8007 2018-08-04 20:37:40 The steel tariffs have hurt the auto industry, construction, the oil industry and every other industry that uses steel.
8008 2018-08-04 20:37:31 When we run out of oil I bet we’ll feel pretty stupid using it to wrap avocados and bananas
8009 2018-08-04 20:37:26 I think she's talking about that Red Hijab Anty who think she deserves ministerial appointment fr dragging a policeman.
8010 2018-08-04 20:36:55 Nothing like taking 14 cases of 35# fry oil down two flights of stairs to my biggest customer just to hear “hey dawg those go upstairs” 
8011 2018-08-04 20:36:43 STEVEN ESSIEN WROTE
How do I know that Nigeria is a 'shithole' country?
The Buhari administration wants to build a refinery in Katsina where there is no drop of oil and establish catle colonies in Akwa Ibom, Edo and Bayelsa where the Crude oil is goten from.

8014 2018-08-04 20:36:29 Very true but dilla wasn’t a soldier so he had no need to have a battalion. Dilla was a watch maker, and rza was a oil painter
8015 2018-08-04 20:36:17 Lol I dey do that Scam called NysC and its my second month wey alawee no gree show
8016 2018-08-04 20:35:33 Red oil

Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, & let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, & the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.
8021 2018-08-04 20:34:44 U think Oromo can take our motherland and oil? If u think it’s easy but u guys are dreaming, somalia is somalia we will fight like 1977 but this time we will not stop until Addis Ababa, Oromo u need to check somalia history before u start war that u can’t able to handled
8022 2018-08-04 20:34:43 But have you tried lavender oil?

8025 2018-08-04 20:34:35 I am going to investigate. I use CBD oil and it causes dry mouth and many of my prescription meds do too. My dentist said dry mouth is why I all of a sudden have cavities. I didn't have any growing up!

8027 2018-08-04 20:34:20 S/o to @33Verses for getting my oil changed. You’re the best
8028 2018-08-04 20:34:18 Venezuela was very Oil rich too once. But Marxist Socialist like what we see among the #SNP rank & file will soon put paid to that. Scotland oil revenue has reduced as so the  crude oil price. Perhaps you could provide evidence of the figures you state. I know them to be nonsense
8029 2018-08-04 20:34:14 Gosh you must be suffering in a heatwave caused by that anthropogenic oil and gas. Bet the plants are having a feast.

8032 2018-08-04 20:33:46 PSA ABOUT HAIR DYE. Just used @GarnierUK Oila hair dye. It's rubbish. Left my hair dry and only slightly tinted. Wouldn't recommend, especially as it's marketed as a oil/nourishing hair dye. RIP MONEY
8033 2018-08-04 20:33:39 Each! 
8034 2018-08-04 20:33:08 The upward pressure on oil,is that the Saudi Aramco ipo won’t happen without 80usd /barrel oil.Then we have Iranian oil taken out of supply soon.Then higher demand and lower supply.Then we have stringent new laws on shipping oil/gas,which raise prices.200 usd /barrel soon
8035 2018-08-04 20:33:01 For some of us, that's a productive weekend. 
8036 2018-08-04 20:32:29 Only double? If I've any cash left after stockpiling olive oil, leaf tea and decent coffee, I'll lay down a bottle. Thank heavens @maltwhiskybar had the foresight to set up a microbrewery in the village..
8037 2018-08-04 20:32:14 Keep going.. how about trying the Arctic circle... you can tell the polar bears how its okay theyre dying cos the oil companies are paying you back handers... or better still just leave the planet...
8038 2018-08-04 20:31:59 "A" bottle? I rather doubt that.....
8039 2018-08-04 20:31:53 Your going down with the rest of them plastic bread bag with vegetable oil
8040 2018-08-04 20:31:40 okay, so you have oily skin, & you fight that with astringent, & then turn around & apply coconut oil?? babe. okay...lemme DM you. hold, pls.
8041 2018-08-04 20:31:21 Who wants to go eat with me after i get my oil change?
8042 2018-08-04 20:30:53 Those who call for privatization of public property and natural resources should be exiled to a derelict offshore oil rig. Just an idea.

8046 2018-08-04 20:30:18 Took the words right outta my fingers.  absolutely
8047 2018-08-04 20:30:08 I would agree to a limited move.  The US is likely to announce a carrier group may be sent to Persian Gulf, past experience, which will heighten the possibility of a conflict.  Iran has multiple times in the past dropped mines in the Straight of Hormuz.  Fear can drive oil up.
8048 2018-08-04 20:30:00 Have y'all heard of #PalmOil ? Turns out its one of many commodities that lead to massive #deforestation and #wildlife endangerment

8051 2018-08-04 20:29:22 Donnie,
What you know about China’s economy could fit on the tip of a needle. The fact is they are very diverse in their trading and they base their currency on the Dollar, Oil or Gold. When they start to feel pain they simply devalue their currency to make their products cheaper
8052 2018-08-04 20:29:20 Looking for oil state by all means, if he refuses, EFCC will be on him that’s for sure , Nigeriaaaaaa
8053 2018-08-04 20:29:16 Needs all new front and back brakes, rotors, calipers, belts, 3 engine sensors/valves and an oil change. Definitely a lesson learned. 
8054 2018-08-04 20:29:13 I hear ya. 
8055 2018-08-04 20:29:04 I love the Canadian bloggers who drive over the border to pick up their progesterone oil which is illegal in Canada then sell it to others back here in Canada and label it a Libido booster with recklessness.
8056 2018-08-04 20:28:49 Successfully figured out how to put thc oil in an empty juul pod.. ya’ll still living in the past
8057 2018-08-04 20:28:48 Wait.  Inflation up. Gas and oil up. Deficit up. Healthcare costs up. Air and water quality down. Stella and aluminum costs up. Soy bean farmers getting bailed out. Companies moving production overseas. Food costs up. Risk of war up.
8058 2018-08-04 20:28:48 I woke up to a clean car, checked oil & a full tank of gas.... my dad is the best lol
8059 2018-08-04 20:28:45 @mrs_b_mac Don't forget to take pictures when @BMac_Redbeard  changes the oil.  You're going to want save the proof
8060 2018-08-04 20:28:38 If we had stayed on the path towards energy independence and green energy initiatives 1st put forth by Jimmy Carter(a visionary) we would be very much off petroleum products by now.  Republican shills for the oil industry, Reagan, Bush) would not let that happen.
8061 2018-08-04 20:28:37 Thats what everyone keeps telling me & I figure if they use it now for anxiety they must have worked the paranoid kinks out. I think part of my issue is all the damn heavy duty pain meds Im on. This would be a much healthier alternative. Hempseed oil helps so heres hoping 
8062 2018-08-04 20:28:25 Fell asleep after my delicious oriental vegetable, cumin and garlic oil soup - all else prepped but birthday dinner tonight !!
8063 2018-08-04 20:28:21 Some mechanics try to sound all fancy and they throw in big words making you think that you need a some crazy stuff done with your car when all they need to do is fix a screw and change your oil lol fuck the Purrfect Auto Service in West Covina

8066 2018-08-04 20:28:00 So since we are buying more oil from Ecuador which was going to offer Julian A. In & then backed off after you went there. I don't trust you.
8067 2018-08-04 20:27:44 I am not afraid of Russia because Putin's government, for all its grandiose bluster, is extremely fragile and could go down come the next recession or drop in oil prices.
8068 2018-08-04 20:27:32 she said a baby oil ass whooping 
8069 2018-08-04 20:27:26 toss in oil with salt and pepper then put it in the oven, so bomb
8070 2018-08-04 20:27:25 I want to put these questions out there to drumpf supporters. Who wants to live under a authoritarian regime? Who wants oil wells and coal mines in national parks? Who wants the rich to get richer while you stagnate? Who wants a free press or just read/hear what gov says?
8071 2018-08-04 20:27:25 What fuels oil prices? JT pipe lines refusals?
8072 2018-08-04 20:27:12 Right there with you brother! 
8073 2018-08-04 20:27:06 I really do. Truly.

8078 2018-08-04 20:26:27 I haven’t, but coconut oil melts at 76, so I know it must be below that.

8080 2018-08-04 20:26:16 Trust me, in America plenty talk about sex out loud. At least the people I know do.  Maybe you need new people to talk with. lol
8081 2018-08-04 20:26:00 @jvn What would you recommend for beard oil? I have some that I get from the salon I go to, but my friend is wanting something they can find in a store. Any suggestions? Thanks. Oh, and you're basically the best human. That's all 
8082 2018-08-04 20:25:53 A good cook then 
8083 2018-08-04 20:25:49 @Sawbones @JustinMcElroy @sydneemcelroy If you want to know what's in Justin's CBD oil, I might be able to help you! I'm a laboratory analyst at a fully accredited marijuana testing lab in Oregon, so I do this professionally. Let me know if you're interested!
8084 2018-08-04 20:25:43 You are so full of s***. Always trying to sell your snake oil to the ignorant.

 We're definitely not winning. We will be paying more for everything that comes from China which is about everything on the shelves in the American stores.
8085 2018-08-04 20:25:37 Also, you guys can get all the hydration PLUS nutrients you'll need for a long day of being an absolute penis by drinking cooking oil.

8098 2018-08-04 20:24:03 I went to @jiffylube and asked for an oil change and an inspection. Sure. No problem. I receive an oil change, no inspection.  Leaving money on the table and losing a customer guys. It’s not rocket science.
8099 2018-08-04 20:23:55 in hindsight, when the man didn't take my cell number was when i knew i was going to flake on my oil change appointment
8100 2018-08-04 20:23:50 Them: “So how’s adulthood going?”

Me: “Well, I’m getting my car’s oil changed, but I’m also liking Instagram photos of famous cats while I wait.”

Them: “.................?”

Damn stuff was cold as hell, too.
8124 2018-08-04 20:19:43 It’s not a hard time. It’s the ‘fact’ that whatever $ that came into ppl pockets ended up in Big Oil pockets. Nice going National Socialist Republicans. Your tax scam bill is just that AScam. So take your heads out of the sand

8126 2018-08-04 20:19:28 Ive been using coconut oil since June 2017 on my entire body. I put Sunscreen on as well and my skin is perfect. Well, I have a small pimple on my forehead but I know it's the "5 for R30" chocolates from dischem
8127 2018-08-04 20:19:25 Tea tree oil! Also 3x a day might be a little much for cleaning. Once or twice with a non scented antibacterial soap is plenty.
8128 2018-08-04 20:19:23 Did you know that prior to Venezuela's collapse they were one of the richest countries in the world per capita?

They still have massive oil and gas reserves, however, due to corruption and the stealing of privately held companies, they can't remove the oil from the ground.
8129 2018-08-04 20:19:11 Turn no oil into extra virgin olive oil, no sugar into sugar from fruit, dates etc. Wholewheat flour & bread, barley porridge  whole eggs etc. and you will still feel light, healthier.

Can't *anyone* anymore just make an honest living instead of peddling snake oil?
8133 2018-08-04 20:18:00 Hot oil is available....that would help
8134 2018-08-04 20:17:50 Pretty much.  They need a lot of time to drain though or they get soggy and gross.  Best results I've gotten was from keeping the chips just below the surface of the oil rather than deep frying them entirely
8135 2018-08-04 20:17:35 Yes, certain oil rich regions are full of people who think nothing of air freighting a few of their supercars over to use while they are staying in their London mansion for a couple of months in the summer.
8136 2018-08-04 20:17:35 Foreign capital is the catalyst, local speculation was an answer to the catalyst. Low interest rates enable local speculators and public in general to compete for the scrums. Remove foreign capital in BC and it’s the equivalent of an oil crash in Alberta.

8212 2018-08-04 20:06:01 It’s not really a “salad”, so traditionally you never put lettuce, tomatoes and things like that. Just all kinds of nuts, fried peas, sesame, etc. so very dry, but with some oil! Anyway, making a salad is also a good thing. Pickled tea leaves are quite unique to Burma, I believe.

8219 2018-08-04 20:04:28 Don't you also think the sale of anointing oil and mantels should be be stopped in Pentecostal churches? In Pentecostal churches, Christians are blessed based on how much they sow in the pastor's basket, don't you think the sale of blessings should stop?
8220 2018-08-04 20:04:15 It sounds a bit like Karma. She voted for a white supremacist who always spoke ill of Latin Americans. What the hell did she expect?

8226 2018-08-04 20:03:29 For a few weeks I went on healthy diet - no spices, no oil, no sugar, no sodas or junk food.. and I felt so light. Our usual oily and spicy food is like poison for body. Makes you feel like shit at the of the day. But it's so difficult to manage healthy food.

Be confident and assertive about making the first move.

8253 2018-08-04 20:00:04 Was probably supporting another club before the oil money came
8254 2018-08-04 20:00:02 Well, found out the coolant leaking from my car is going into the engine and mixing with the oil. I fucking hate cars. I literally cannot remember the last time I wasn't worried about whatever car I had breaking. I'm fucking tired of this shit. fml

8259 2018-08-04 19:59:56 i hate going to mechanics like I came here for an oil change not to have you try and upsell me $500 in upgrades and tell me my 11 year old car is falling apart 

yea no shit just change the oil I'm broke
8260 2018-08-04 19:59:45 Hmm, yet the protesters are worried about oil pipelines, go figure!
8261 2018-08-04 19:59:44 It’s meant to be difficult. I think if you remove sugars, you take out so much veg oil by default.
8262 2018-08-04 19:59:33 Bitch my car needs a oil change a brake tag and a wash lmao
8263 2018-08-04 19:59:31 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.
8264 2018-08-04 19:59:21 Now I know how you sold all that crap like the university, steaks, water, casinos BUT THEY FAILED WHEN IT WAS REVEALED THAT THEY WERE NOTHING BUT SNAKE OIL!

Here you go again selling snake oil but we WON’T let you destroy this country like your bankrupt businesses. 
LIAR!
8265 2018-08-04 19:59:19 CIA engineered Iranian coup at the request of the UK because Mosaddegh wanted to nationalise the oil industry. BP had been basically stealing it. He also wanted normal relations with Russia at a time when the US was picking fights with them. Greed + imperialism. Result=revolution
8266 2018-08-04 19:58:47 this time tho......little guy...early adopter got the Venture capital pricing....and will be the largest wealth transfer since the discovery of OIL....over time.  But it will def happen in our lifetime. Thats why HODL!

8277 2018-08-04 19:57:07 @sanityplease 1. Job we’re increasing prior to #45 being in Office . Manufacturers have not return with a few exceptions (oil , navigation companies ) and with that we have been hit with the heaviest tariffs in record that will play in individuals not getting necessities.
8278 2018-08-04 19:56:50 @realDonaldTrump Governor Cuomo has robbed NY landowners their ability to lease their land to oil and gas.

8286 2018-08-04 19:56:00 Truck and SUV sales are up. We need higher gas prices so we can knock some sense into U.S. citizens. Peak oil is over and this is a finite resource people!!!!!
8287 2018-08-04 19:55:59 
8288 2018-08-04 19:55:54 Yep. Lol.
I went through a detox where my hair shed more than I like, but that seems to be about done. My hair has been way more manageable. Almost no frizz anymore (which is practically a miracle). The rejuvenique oil is an essential, imo - even good for teeth whitening! Lol
8289 2018-08-04 19:55:53 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia did with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil, especially during the last regime. #NewNigeria

8294 2018-08-04 19:55:11 This was startling compared to now:

"While Michael Dukakis proposed tax incentives to encourage domestic oil production and boasted that coal could satisfy the nation’s energy needs for the next three centuries, George Bush took advantage. “I am an environmentalist,” he declared

8298 2018-08-04 19:54:13 Every time I use petrochemicals, plastics, drive cars, etc. Where do you think Europe’s oil and natural gas come from?
8299 2018-08-04 19:54:06 Been reading accounts of the sinking of HMS Dorsetshire. One officer describes his 30 hours treading water as not too bad & morale was high - a rating describes the men dying in the water, screaming, blood, oil sparse rations and the Captain being useless

8301 2018-08-04 19:53:57 please sell the club to some oil merchant cheers
8302 2018-08-04 19:53:53 The annoying part of getting an oil change is the unnecessary upselling. Bruh change my oil so I can go.
8303 2018-08-04 19:53:52 Then tell me why everything is suddenly costing me more? A few cents to a dollar on nearly everything at the grocery store. And for all the damn oil drilling your boys are doing, gas hasn't gone down in a year or more. Why is that? We're the ones paying for your tariffs, sir. ☭

8310 2018-08-04 19:53:15 The assumption is that we leave in a perfect world where callings and sayings of goodnight are so convenient.
Night shift workers on an oil well in panhandle TX get to work at 5pm and find the rig pulling out of the hole(31,000ft) and a  monstrous demanding Rig. Which goodnights?
8311 2018-08-04 19:52:59 Twitter has worse takes but also no one is trying to cure my depression with CBD Oil. Compromise.

8319 2018-08-04 19:52:29 There's a seriously dangerous potential Russia will align deeply w/ radical Islamic nations-both a) seek to undermine w. democratic society, b) are driven by oil/energy revenues,  c) are generally run by autocrats, d) use terrorism to attain goals, & e) are often globally shunned

8329 2018-08-04 19:50:52 I’m so desperate to induce labor I’ll literally try anything that isn’t castor oil. I went to the store today to buy fucking clary sage oil and jasmine oil, I think this is the last idea I have so if anyone has any more throw em my way
8330 2018-08-04 19:50:47 I think a 10 min video of her rubbing baby oil on her titties might trigger me. Maybe try that.
8331 2018-08-04 19:50:33 Blew up my engine Because it burned oil and it was low on oil on my way to work (30 min drive)
8332 2018-08-04 19:50:32 Or, eventually it will become coal, oil, natural gas. Until we dig it up and burn it. Which will release the carbon back into the cycle. But, also, the heat from those chemical bonds. All at once. Even though it took 1000s of years to collect. Ergo: planetary warming.
8333 2018-08-04 19:50:25 It isn't a good news for Nigerians but the cabals as an oil rich country what have gained so far?no light,bad infrastructure,no security high cost of living,no real health care system,bad economy,risen debt,no ordinary man in Nigeria can be proud as a citizen,fuck naija govt

8345 2018-08-04 19:48:33 This has nothing to do with Abdi illey or his henchmen lust for power. This is about OIL. Federal government wants complete control over it where the Somali region wants a fair share of the resources that is comes out of it's region. Even if Abdi is removed, this will not be over
8346 2018-08-04 19:48:25 In 1976, Roy Thomson, Lord Thomson of Fleet died at age 82. The Toronto-born barber’s son became a millionaire owner of broadcasting stations and newspapers and North Sea oil holdings, and was elevated to the peerage in 1963.

8353 2018-08-04 19:47:40 Let's get real here, for a second. Is this a new occurrence? Did North Korea start their nuclear program when Trump got elected? No, North Korea has been making false threats of their nuclear power since Kim Jong Il, but because there is no oil there, the US doesn't care.

8366 2018-08-04 19:45:49 19% of Russian oil Co.  was bought by an anonymous buyer.  If Trump can get sanctions off of Russia,  whoever bought that 19% will make billions in oil revenue.  If we follow the money,  I'm betting Trump/Putin bought it  and will make billions after Trump leaves office.
8367 2018-08-04 19:45:48 Orange Oil or something called Goof Off or Goo Off that works wonders!

8388 2018-08-04 19:42:00 We made a big mistake celebrating for #PM_Abiye leadership too early!

Even #TPLF offered 40% of the #Ogaden Gas/Oil to go to the people in the Somali region, while PM_abiye suggested 5 - 10% that resources to got to the #Somali region.
8389 2018-08-04 19:41:53 เหอๆ
8390 2018-08-04 19:41:51 u know its deep when u have to keep ur vaseline, coconut oil and bath melts in the fridge
8391 2018-08-04 19:41:46 Irrelevant reference. The crisis #southSudan is in has part of its roots in the oil shutdown& the looting.. All ineffective leadership& even worse governance.But I digress; #FreePeterBiar as arbitrary detention is a clear violation of the constitution..Care about the constitution
8392 2018-08-04 19:41:36 I believe ballymun holds a lot of teknomining and US oil shares your highness. Care to comnent on either of these fine companies?
8393 2018-08-04 19:41:34 So using vegetable oil was a bad choice wasn’t it?
8394 2018-08-04 19:41:19 Niggas think they so slick. Ain’t nothing slick to a can of oil.
8395 2018-08-04 19:41:11 Wors, no oil or salt... The best!
8396 2018-08-04 19:41:11 Add a comma and flip the script to TWHS:  "Get on this, girl!"
8397 2018-08-04 19:40:54 Oil price needed to balance the domestic power of Putin, this would be unnecessary.
8398 2018-08-04 19:40:54 Coworker: We can substitute olive oil for sesame seed oil, right?

Me, trying so very desperately not to slap a bitch: ........ No.
8399 2018-08-04 19:40:44 Heard that a #Russian copter went down transporting oil workers from the #Artic Circle to Siberia... any connection with recent #asteroid strike?
8400 2018-08-04 19:40:39 Made a simple pnazanella with the pre-toasted version this evening. Onions, tomatoes, olives, olive oil & fresh parsley - the flavour of the bread was brilliant!!! Again please 
8401 2018-08-04 19:40:20 I don't see how more papitas criollas can be bad for the world and oil palm trees are bad, I understand that (thought they live in different ecosystems).

I just want to keep them affordable :)
8402 2018-08-04 19:40:17 "Oil Fackin Kill ALL of them fackin teeroists".I believe is the actual quote
8403 2018-08-04 19:40:12 It's a coconut oil conditioner. It's a white bottle with a gold top. I use that to wash and condition my weave. And boil it for like 5 mins.
8404 2018-08-04 19:40:11 カルーアサラダ油とかあったら若い女性に大人気美味しさイナズマ級なのになあ。
8405 2018-08-04 19:40:09 Putting sanctions back on Iran will mean they need to sell oil on the black market again. I wonder who this benefits...hmm
8406 2018-08-04 19:40:01  what confuses you? the sweetness? 

i drizzle some olive oil on them & a bit of salt. to balance everything out.
8407 2018-08-04 19:39:44 I can’t even get an oil change in peace...
8408 2018-08-04 19:39:39 If you don’t vote Democrat in these upcoming midterms, you are voting for:

-Russia
-The rich
-Lies
-Oil companies
-Racism
-Bigotry
-Children being ripped from their parents
-Religious influence in our politics
-Anti-LGBT+ rights
-and much more

There is no debating this.
8409 2018-08-04 19:39:35 It's like to find a single drop of oil in the sea and say "oh look that oil is the reason why the rest of the sea is water".. total ignorance...
8410 2018-08-04 19:39:26 Ok , I'll start. You can't have my Cheeto's.
8411 2018-08-04 19:39:15 Why won't I know? I know Y he is been detained and I just told u, u say how will I know. PMB want to crush anything standing on his way to Niger Delta oil and he happens to speak against it as a journalist. If PMB thinks he committed a crime, Y nt arraign him?
8412 2018-08-04 19:39:08 Hm yeah you’re onto something. maybe make the pancakes extra eggy and fry it in more oil/bitter than usual to give it a chewier bread texture
8413 2018-08-04 19:39:06 anyone have oil diffuser recommendations?
8414 2018-08-04 19:39:00 Oil aaru natural gas bur kintu national resources,huh 
8415 2018-08-04 19:38:53 I agree with all of you but, Oil companies of the past didn’t acquired all non-Oil companies so why this time is different?
8416 2018-08-04 19:38:41 @myronebell How much do the oil companies buy you off for?
8417 2018-08-04 19:38:41 —Apple Cider Vinegar 
Soak your hands in a mixture of water & apply cider vinegar (ACV) for 15 minutes. Afterwards, scrub your nails with a nailbrush and some soap, remember to get under the nails too! Let them dry, and then soak in olive oil for another 15 minutes.
8418 2018-08-04 19:38:34  what cracks me up and is you have these left wingers going around saying the world is getting hotter to global & talking smack about oil companies & yet they drive Automobiles and buy gas from the oil company’s 
8419 2018-08-04 19:38:30 You can get calming treats , also lavender essential oil , and they have calming collars infused with essential oils
8420 2018-08-04 19:38:27 2. The tax money and resource would be in our control. Controlled by the people who know were best to spend it. That would not include foreign wars for oil or for no good reason.
8421 2018-08-04 19:38:18 When he orders the Republicans children dipped in hot oil, they might object, cant say for sure though.
8422 2018-08-04 19:38:05 I see, can ghee be used instead of coconut oil?
8423 2018-08-04 19:38:02 And Oil spills!!!!!
8424 2018-08-04 19:38:00 Tried the Mayo, Eggs, Honey & Olive Oil on my hair & it really worked  it’s so soft & curly 
8425 2018-08-04 19:37:51 She's a goner... Yup, I neem oil the little bugger all season. It just got hit with a particularly bad strain of mold...
8426 2018-08-04 19:36:45 Lol you gon need it. Cause it’s gon look like you had a Gatorade bath in baby oil when you hop out
8427 2018-08-04 19:36:14 Oh yum....yes! I fry corn tortillas in oil, pat dry, and salt. Then for the tacos lettuce, tomato, onions, salsa cheese. Yum.
8428 2018-08-04 19:36:11 Ditto- I don't know what people see in Rees Mogg (or JC really) he's a very nasty, greedy, snake oil salesman.
8429 2018-08-04 19:35:40 We don't want any Trumps back in NY!
They've done a lifetime of dammage here allready. Send em to Russia or North Korea or to an offshore oil drilling
rig. Just not here!
8430 2018-08-04 19:35:33 There is some medical research that shows a link between fish oil consumption and an improvement in anxiety. Personally I take fish oil for my cholesterol. I've tried probiotics for my GI issues. No change. I don't like them because they aren't regulated. #ActuallyAutistic
8431 2018-08-04 19:35:25 Chuckles, jiya NTA sun nuna ku beside me akwai wani basullube dan uwan ku, the guy was too happy kun gano palm oil, congratulations
8432 2018-08-04 19:35:22 I spilled hot oil on me and the floor. work was great today
8433 2018-08-04 19:35:22 They were bought off by middle east oil money...  Global inteligence state and its Deep State cells...
8434 2018-08-04 19:35:06 good. then we can start growing more potatoes instead of oil palm trees
8435 2018-08-04 19:34:48 Tires and oil change taking forever.
8436 2018-08-04 19:34:47 I've planted a forest, I power my house with renewables, I forego a vehicle for most of the year, I eat no palm oil, I make no frivolous journeys, I do not fly, I practice permaculture, I eat only organic food in season, deep ecology is my credo and this party is going to change
8437 2018-08-04 19:34:33 But these rubbish Mr alright that maybe a laughing stock when they try talking to original owners of the language. English.  Tell this man that he is talking bullshits. Tell him to apply for teaching job which pay more than what is getting now , that's if he has a job .
8438 2018-08-04 19:34:22 Too hot oil au multitasking siku ya plantains au you don't love the plantains that much?

8442 2018-08-04 19:34:04 @renoomokri @benmurraybruce Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia did with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil
8443 2018-08-04 19:34:00 You're forgeting that Peter Biar was working as a consultant in the Office of Minister for National Security Service in the Office of the President in 2013. If you know him that well, then ask him. As for 2012 oil shut-down and looting, that's irrelevant.
8444 2018-08-04 19:33:47 I wish I didn’t have to go get my oil changed on my lunch because I literally just want to lay down and curl up in a ball
8445 2018-08-04 19:33:37 She belongs to class of ppl thinking it won't affect them, and it may not. Media/entertainment, academia, political classes are shielded, being integral parts of the propaganda and control structure. 
It's the masses she mocks that she is looking out for.
8446 2018-08-04 19:33:35 O o o oil on the roadddd
8447 2018-08-04 19:33:35 Olive oil, small potatoes, onions, red, yellow, and orange peppers, and a bunch of emril spice blend. Two hours in the oven. This was my improvised yumminess that I threw together today.  It was delicious, and should last quite a few days.
8448 2018-08-04 19:33:31 "You can be sure of Shell." - Shell Oil
8449 2018-08-04 19:33:27 Yeah I’m not driving to Indiana for an oil change.
8450 2018-08-04 19:33:11 Oil frm Kaula Lumpur. Wheat frm Moscow. Lentils frm Sydney. Fish from Ho Chi Min. Tea frm Colombo. Cars from Tokyo. Watches from Geneva. Cotton from Cairo. Shirts from Milan Purses from New York

And thn we worry about why Pakistan’s economy is hurting and imports are killing us
8451 2018-08-04 19:33:08 Tea tree oil or in extreme circumstances hydrocortisone cream, that'll take the sting and itch out but use sparingly x
8452 2018-08-04 19:33:01 It didn't need any more dressing because if the olive oil that was used to roast it.
8453 2018-08-04 19:33:00 That's part of it. The key question is: Are private property holders secure? This is independent of how many industries the state controls.

Telecomm and electricity make this clear in Norway: the state largely *built* those assets

(Oil is different, but that's the exception)
8454 2018-08-04 19:32:40 Very true no way would they put their reputation and career on the line to sell snake oil. $CELZ to the bank...
8455 2018-08-04 19:32:31 Peppermint essential oil on your temples and the back of your neck can help sometimes! I've only done it with headaches, so I'm not quite sure if it'll be 100% effective with a migraine.
8456 2018-08-04 19:32:22 My niece was diagnosed with DIPG when she was 3, and given 6 months to live. 5 years later, we just got the first news that the tumor has had no growth between MRIs. Only medicine? CBD oil. Looking forward to the episode!
8457 2018-08-04 19:32:15 Oh! No I mean, did *you* cut it with oil. Chocolate itself is waxy by nature in ice cream. I have a chip recipe on p355 in my book. 
8458 2018-08-04 19:32:13 Great.  Are yall hooked on olive oil too yet 
8459 2018-08-04 19:32:06 World:
Iran/Iraq revolution near imminent.
China builds concentration camps for minorities.
American economic records.
China continues to buy oil from Iran.
Tommy freed.

Manafort had a fancy jacket.
8460 2018-08-04 19:32:00 #DYK each oil rig employs an average of 50 people? New Mexico now has 104 rigs so that’s a LOT of jobs! #OilAndGas
8461 2018-08-04 19:31:46 Food would have been nice before I decided to wait for an oil change.
8462 2018-08-04 19:31:39 How much is rent, oil, labour and energy bills? Pay the money dude. 
8463 2018-08-04 19:31:38 아아 고민 된다 ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
8464 2018-08-04 19:31:15 We figured it would have issues eventually - we took advantage of the offer while it lasted.

8466 2018-08-04 19:30:57 I wanna massage this hot body 
An oil massage 
8467 2018-08-04 19:30:37 Started the long weekend off by accidentally getting a drop of oil of oregano directly on my lip. Would not recommend.
8468 2018-08-04 19:30:30 Sadly, I can’t think of a good option. If the coconut oil was soft enough to mix in a stand mixer, it would also be wet enough to make it clump up like a paste.
8469 2018-08-04 19:30:24 And body oil, ice, candles, strawberries, and a blind fold.
8470 2018-08-04 19:30:08 Those of peters did not pick up arms in December 2013,were not involved in the shutting down of the oil in 2012, the looting,the lack of discipline in the armed forces,famine&youth employment.Constructive criticism will be considered destructive criticism by those critiqued.
8471 2018-08-04 19:30:07 Hot Oil Treatments, are lovely 4 a added moisture! Typically this is done as a deep condition before shampoo. Or, use it as you see fit. #summerlovin #selfcare #HairCare #beauty #hydrate #healthyhairjourney #healthyhair #DIY #products #SaturdayMotivation

8473 2018-08-04 19:29:46 The only stand my mom ever took on TV was against Popeye. She said Olive Oil was a bad roll model & I should never wait for a man to save me. She ultimately relented because I promised to be a strong woman, & we both knew I only watched the show for the spinach-eating sequence 
8474 2018-08-04 19:29:36 He just paid for and opened a school in Ohio.. and has amassed a fortune and brand name recognition you are stuck drooling over hahaha. Oh and he would slaughter you in an IQ test or even a spelling bee!! Think quick.. which weighs more a 100lbs of tanning oil or 100lbs of rocks?
8475 2018-08-04 19:29:28 #FireZinke Never before have we seen such corruption in Dept of Interior .Zinke is selling off millions of acres of public owned land which WE own to his buddies & now he & Trump issued law that the oil cos dont have to pay for any oil spills or damage they do to this land.
8476 2018-08-04 19:29:20 Oh yea saw a link to a video about palm oil bathing on Youtube. I couldn't even click to watch 
8477 2018-08-04 19:29:19 try tea tree oil mixed with coconut oil in case it burns
8478 2018-08-04 19:28:58 What about the 200,000 oil and gas industry workers laid off last year. Or the 300,000 AT&T workers laid off last year and took those jobs to India for 27 cents an hour labor force. Or what about the 400,000 Wal-Mart cashiers fixing to get laid off for auto check out
8479 2018-08-04 19:28:52 jamaican mechanics blow mines ohh dee , niggas think imma sit out here in the burning heat until 6pm for a damn oil change got me fucked up
8480 2018-08-04 19:28:48 Despite the inferiority complex Hulu Originals logo on the screen the whole time, "The Looming Tower" is absolutely fantastic, handles religion incredibly well, and makes me long for the U.S. foreign policy future not shaped by oil.
8481 2018-08-04 19:28:44 yunggoth> underdog along with a couple other people, who know wtf is going on.
8482 2018-08-04 19:28:37 I just saw a picture, and I thought to myself, "Omgosh, what's that on the side of his pants." Oh, it's just a cell phone in his pocket.

Devil you are not about to get me today! LOL 

Where's the holy oil. I need to repent, and ask God to cleanse my mind... 
8483 2018-08-04 19:28:14 How ironic that your ignorance is on display.. Propylene/ Ethylene travels through pipelines to plants that make the plastic for the smartphone that you typed on... You drive an oil/gas consuming vehicle to a job site to protest an oil/ gas pipeline...Please un-confuse me????
8484 2018-08-04 19:28:05 Oil and gas companies.... like the ones in Alberta... the majority of the oil sands... and you want to make it harder for them to do the thing you want them to do?  Pick a single platform and stand on it. Let me know when you do
8485 2018-08-04 19:27:51 I have so many friends from different circles attending #GenCon. I wish I had arranged a Murder On The Orient Express style caper, but replace "murder" with "heist" and "Orient Express" with "Lucas Oil" #TitleNeedsRevision

8489 2018-08-04 19:26:52 I got a truck needs the oil changed!
8490 2018-08-04 19:26:51 I got out of bed with the intention to make slap clips cause there’s nothing to snack on in this flat...but I can’t bring myself to fill up a pot with my extra virgin olive oil 
8491 2018-08-04 19:26:42 Amazing deep ass,, need a good oil message in her ass.
8492 2018-08-04 19:26:35 You’re throwing oil on the fire 
8493 2018-08-04 19:26:34 Whilst you're indeed correct - the current conditions do not make sense to stay...

The greatest black gold to leave Naija isn't her crude oil...
8494 2018-08-04 19:26:27 Gonna make some body scrub when I get home today. Coconut oil and sugar. I’ll let y’all know how it turns out..
8495 2018-08-04 19:26:12 What another absolute FARCE, from the King of  , @realDonaldTrump. 

The Republicans @GOP have been trying to shut down @NASA over the past 4 DECADES... claiming military spending was "suffering", for Science... 

Especially, once Science was interfering with their Big Oil...
8496 2018-08-04 19:26:02 Currently getting a oil change ..
8497 2018-08-04 19:25:56 @velcat if you like @AnnCoulter you’re so far off the ledge you can’t even see the center from where you are.  Anyone who likes oil and gas, shotguns, golf and John Kasich is not a liberal.

8503 2018-08-04 19:23:53 Two oil changes in two cars today, hung smoke detectors in house, hung carbon monoxide detectors in house, re-rocked front landscaping. 

Next: mow and trim yard, paint a bedroom, and maybe replace deck boards.
8504 2018-08-04 19:23:35 I agree. Right from the beginning, Maxine Waters astutely observed that the entire tRump-Putin conspiracy has to do with oil and US economic sanctions against Russia.
8505 2018-08-04 19:23:14 Did you know that you can reuse our small essential oil bottles? I love to use them as cane toppers in the garden!

8510 2018-08-04 19:22:09 Nero & Sabina blamed Christians for the Great Fire of Rome in July 64 AD. Apparently, they executed the "pillars of the Church" in the Colosseum, in late summer 65 AD, during the Quinquennial Neronia. Peter was crucified inverted, Paul beheaded & John boiled in oil yet unharmed
8511 2018-08-04 19:21:53 I don't do the oil
8512 2018-08-04 19:21:37 @BLMUtah  2/2 & leaving hay 2 help them along. They will not breed in times of drought, they regulate themselves! Feed them well, then let them go!

8516 2018-08-04 19:21:27 I had to find a boyfriend that’s boujee like me. I asked him what kind of souvenir he wanted from Dubai, my guy said some kind of local oil based cologne

One of the missions of this blog is helping fellow oil traders stay ahead of the curve. This is critical to retail traders due to limited funds. Anyone tries to derail this mission should show his credentials with solid arguments but not only hearsay.

8536 2018-08-04 19:18:20 I’ve been asked what I do for clear skin. I use birth control . Then I use soap and water, rose water always, vitamin e oil, and witch hazel for a toner. I also never put body lotion on my face and I spend money on quality foundation.

8547 2018-08-04 19:16:36 The oil and gas sector in Alberta and Saskatchewan employs hundreds of thousands people. But I guess you don’t know there is more to this country than Quebec. Check a map the country doesn’t end at the western border of Ontario. Don’t worry we’ll keep up the transfer payments
8548 2018-08-04 19:16:33 Energy independence has to come from renewable resources, not from oil, gas, or coal. It’s about Nuclear, Fusion, and Fission. Our planet is dying, and that’ll be America’s fault. And your kids will die. And you’ll be blaming democrats who won’t let you into their bunkers.
8549 2018-08-04 19:16:23 Nice Whataboutits. The sewage treatment  plant is nearly finished & coal sinks. Its stable. Of course  we would like it gone but it's not as dangerous  as dilbit. All the risk & no rewards for BC. You cant drink oil.

Climatologists support nuclear anyway, wind and solar are promoted by big oil and carbon lobbies because they know it can't compete with them.
8555 2018-08-04 19:15:51 Was it cut with oil? Helps if it's saturated, like (refined) coconut.

8558 2018-08-04 19:15:39 "If you have nuclear, why piss around with wind & solar? Variable cost of fuel in a nuclear plant is small."
"The ones that went with nuclear and hydro decarbonized. The ones that went with wind and solar failed and keep failing."
Wind & solar =  "greenwashing" for coal/oil/gas.

8577 2018-08-04 19:13:38 The cartels didn't take control of the oil before Chavez, or during Chavez, but just coincidentally things went to shit after Chavez; in reality Chavez sent the economy into freefall and it just so happened to crash after his untimely death.

Putin said he told Trump they now share an interest in managing the price of oil & gas. The US no longer plainly suffers if prices are up. That means shale is more profitable.

8647 2018-08-04 19:04:37 Because those in power are investors in foreign oil via refineries & related business that delivers it all the way to pump.

8931 2018-08-04 18:26:35 Lmao whew that night  they put sumn in that oil that’s all I can say 
8932 2018-08-04 18:26:29 I just got my brakes and an oil change for a hot and ready
8933 2018-08-04 18:26:28 You say that, but I was a MSP in the past and have  some  remaining connections to MVPs and evangelists.
It's always jarring when reasonable and pleasant people activate drone mode on their private social network and try to sell you things that range from 'meh' to snake oil.
8934 2018-08-04 18:26:27 India be like God has given everything except oil

8935 2018-08-04 18:26:25 I like how all my friends  from high school that were trying to sell me flat tummy tea and lululemon sports bras are trying to sell me CBD oil now

8939 2018-08-04 18:25:34 I wanna thank my dad for everything he’s taught me. Changing my motor oil my seen like a basic task but not a lot of people know ho to do it! Thanks for teaching me dad!
8940 2018-08-04 18:25:27 The Fascist States of America does not care how many people die on both sides , losses will be used as propaganda to insure the war goes on and the oil gets stolen.
8941 2018-08-04 18:25:01 The price never moved up on the news and everyone had already forgotten about this as KSA has other ways of shipping oil.
8942 2018-08-04 18:24:57 snake oil
8943 2018-08-04 18:24:45 It a hull! Give a barrel full of oil for the prize please 
8944 2018-08-04 18:24:30 In 1910, Gattefosse burned a hand very badly and later claimed he treated it effectively with Lavender Oil.
8945 2018-08-04 18:24:24 JLo is known to slim down with the grapefruit oil diet. Studies show smelling it can reduce one's appetite and help with portion control.

8947 2018-08-04 18:24:06 Absolutely true. 2 years ago I drove from YEG to YZF and saw very little new oil or gas activity. Last month I drove back from YZF and was amazed at the huge number of new pumpjacks operating within view of the highway.
8948 2018-08-04 18:23:57 Only castor oil taste worst
8949 2018-08-04 18:23:55 Especially sesame oil, the rice and chickpeas will keep until the Brexit food crisis.
8950 2018-08-04 18:23:30 This is equal to having someone come in from Greenpeace to discuss oil distribution
8951 2018-08-04 18:23:25 All true, & I’d add phys delivery terms are awkward as well.  That said, none of this chgs broader point - SOE’s of world’s biggest oil importer whose demand is growing 6.8% y/y per BBG can pull phys volume fr Brent - in fact it’s a matter of Chinese nat security that they do
8952 2018-08-04 18:23:15 I get it. While driving to Seattle we were somewhere in North Dakota and there was a smell that made me feel really nostalgic and I couldn’t place it. Rounded the corner: oil refinery.
8953 2018-08-04 18:23:15 Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides by SOPHIE makes me feel like a ballerina who rips sheet metal apart w her bare hands and I’m LOVING it
8954 2018-08-04 18:23:03 Certainly possible. But I imagine Iran + Venezuela will work out separate deals with better terms for China b/c of pressure of sanctions; they can be compelled to deliver oil in RMB w/o having any of their strains added to the contract. Also part of goal of contract is 1/2
8955 2018-08-04 18:22:38 Finally proper olive oil in my ears hope it helps
8956 2018-08-04 18:22:36 Ptsd causes teeth grinding so now I have an infection and might need a root canal but I’m going to try to heal it with antibiotics and oil of oregano and coconut oil.
8957 2018-08-04 18:22:04 Repeat the chicken from the chicken is hot oil.
8958 2018-08-04 18:22:00 Somebody threw a bottle of Omega 3 pills out of a moving car and hit me. Luckily my injuries were only super fish oil. #puns #science
8959 2018-08-04 18:21:54 Note to self: do NOT buy any more rice or chickpeas or sesame oil until you've used up all the other packets you forgot you'd bought because your larder cupboard was in chaos.

8964 2018-08-04 18:21:13 Lol, bro u seem 2 be oblivious of the fact that the oil and gas industry is the most corrupt part of our system. A committee was set up to look into the allegations of the honorable minister of petroleum against the GMD of NNPC, any report yet? Any action yet?

8967 2018-08-04 18:19:59 I was meant to be joining a party at Glenshero this month but ended up having to grub around on the seabed looking for oil in West Africa. Everyone that goes will have a great time.
8968 2018-08-04 18:19:53 The ants regrouped overnight. Internet told me to fight them with peppermint oil. Will it work?

8971 2018-08-04 18:19:40 You should be worried because the attention and pressure it would bring to Pakistan from US and Oil producing countries and it would be major motivation for destabilisation of Iran.
8972 2018-08-04 18:19:34 I get my oil changed and like 2 days later I total my car 
8973 2018-08-04 18:19:06 Absolutely agree, that party is very savvy , the are a well oil machine. That is why they still have a party. Bring in the right AG, (Trey Gowdy) could cripple the party if pursued! Just an opinion

8975 2018-08-04 18:18:51 Hell. You could beat dowels into it. I may have done that to pieces of pipe with crude oil in them in a pinch.
8976 2018-08-04 18:18:33 Are you serious? Trudeau bought the pipeline and his government is doing absolutely nothing to get the rest of the permits or to start work on it! He's never intended for it to be built! The oil barons you're talking about that he's helping are the Saudis and other despots!

8989 2018-08-04 18:16:39 You’re not fooling anybody. Please look up what ‘oil’ is if you’re seriously unsure.
8990 2018-08-04 18:16:30 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
8991 2018-08-04 18:15:56 WARM WATER BENEFITS 

-Very calming and relaxing, specially when taking a bath
-Makes you warm specially when you're cold
-Lowers stress level 
(Follow @Sunflowrx on insta!) 
-Washes away dirt and oil build up
-Helps clear out sinuses
-Relieves muscle soreness and stiffness
8992 2018-08-04 18:15:45 To imagine that UAE discovered oil 1st in 1972, and Nigeria pre 1960, but today you cannot compare UAE and Nigeria. 
But still the youths of today still eulogize and revere these old men that call themselves leaders, same ones who put us in this abyss.
8993 2018-08-04 18:15:43 He is likely the laziest human ever. Do you think he has ever actually held a job, washed a dish, cooked a meal, changed the oil in his car, or any kind of labor EVER? He has drifted through life being a false figurehead and playing at being a man.
8994 2018-08-04 18:15:38 Besides oil and gas will run out eventually we mind as well move on to sources that we know aren’t going anyway anytime soon
8995 2018-08-04 18:15:34 a bouquet of body odor, vape oil and microwaved fish.
8996 2018-08-04 18:15:31 Yea he put trophy hunters in charge of protecting animals, oil guys in charge of EPA, a 1%er in charge of public schools, etc etc. Oxymoronic!
8997 2018-08-04 18:15:24 "The biggest change I felt was the air pressure and I'm not sure it was the right direction,"  -- @RyanJNewman @Lucas_Oil. P16 after 17 laps completed.
8998 2018-08-04 18:15:07 How many oil wells and refineries does that replace?

Once mined, lithium can be recycled forever, using solar energy. How many times can you recycle oil?

If you hold out for the “unicorn technology” you’ll still be waiting long after everything has been poisoned.
8999 2018-08-04 18:15:05 Overly simplistic answer would be that they want higher oil prices and increased access to markets for their oil. War in the Middle East and the major turn away from alternative fuels  will hike demand and prices. Removal of sanctions will open markets.
9000 2018-08-04 18:15:03 Solar and other forms of renewable can they generate too much and can overheat the system that’s the real problem. We don’t need oil or gas, the sun provides energy, the oceans provide energy, and wind provides energy.
9001 2018-08-04 18:14:44 Oil Man was running from Dust Man ...

Thank you!
9004 2018-08-04 18:14:18 The oil discount yesterday was@$30 barrel for landlocked Cda vs world price....that is only a loss to Canada of $43 Million daily revenue.

9007 2018-08-04 18:13:59 Gee, ma, while I appreciate the fact that you took my car to get an oil change or whatever, it sure would've been nice if you'd, uh, TOLD me you were taking my car and/or, you know. Asked if maybe *I* needed my car? Which I do, so this is great.
9008 2018-08-04 18:13:55 See? Oil is it a powerful, he was taller than you big liar.
9009 2018-08-04 18:13:45 Latest run shows @RyanJNewman p14 in @Lucas_Oil Camaro ZL1  after 17 laps @WGI.

9013 2018-08-04 18:12:48 Gabapentin’s side effect profile is wider than Lyrica. Lyrica=stream line & more intense. Gabapentin “snake oil” running under the radar increasing ADRs & polypharmacy chasing side effects. Deprescribing should be a option but instead the dosage is increased compounding typically

9039 2018-08-04 18:09:43 The usual story - it’s all about $$$, oil, arms sales, the petrodollar - all for the benefit of the wealthy. This is simply a method to discredit a man who has stood for decency & fairness his entire life. He can’t be bought so the criminal blairites are trying to remove him.

That's 96grams/day 
3.5 ounces/day 
Reduce some by a factor of 10 to make oil, 
Transforming some into a cup of juice. 
Can't smoking, sure! But can ingesting.

My sis suffering from #glioblastoma Multiforme grade IV (detected 4 years ago) is following Dr Banerjee protocol, besides taking other alternative treatments ( @ayurveda ), following died protocol (fresh cotton cheese, flax seed oil), #pranayam & yoga.
9071 2018-08-04 18:05:58 Will those tracks traverse other counties?. This is the stupidity of the highest order. So security now has been restored by those given the jobs of transporting crude oil?What if Mombasa, Machakos, Nairobi,Kiambu,Nakuru e.t.c residents say no to those tracks?
9072 2018-08-04 18:05:57 Lol not necessary, just a fun fact. So many amazing innovation projects taking off in our oil sands.

9077 2018-08-04 18:05:41 I’m beginning to think the Chinese fleeing from USD denominated assets is tied to China asserting a physical link between yuan/oil/gold. What this means is the Yuan/USD exchange rate is a side show. Chinese businesses; however will increasingly not want to accept USD...

9103 2018-08-04 18:02:50 Oil is not the only natural resource. Google these nations exports.Sweet, innocent Sweden apparently making money selling arms to countries notorious for human rights abuse. Sweden will be Muslim country 50 years from now. USA will persevere in spite of the mesmerized democrats.
9104 2018-08-04 18:02:47 Idk about y’all but I could seriously drink olive oil, I love that shit so much
9105 2018-08-04 18:02:33 Has anyone tried the new @LennyBoyBrew kambucha with CBD oil? Anyone care to join me this afternoon to give it a try?
9106 2018-08-04 18:02:33 Like they dont understand that their hair costs less to maintain. My fucking shampoo and conditioner costs 3x more than regular hair products then I have to buy hair oil, cream, satin sheets and towels to ensure no frizz or tangles
9107 2018-08-04 18:02:23 I’m getting my oil changed and I’m so hungover I’m trying not to throw up

9109 2018-08-04 18:02:12 Seeing what Quatar and Saudi did with their oil money is making me wonder if Nigeria is selling groundnut oil. Greed is our number one problem, followed by nepotism and the rest, (it will take me a whole year to list them ) @AsoRock @NGRSenate @NGRPresident @MBuhari
9110 2018-08-04 18:01:57 Would you like to try my beard oil to improve your shaving experience, made from the oil of real bearded snakes
9111 2018-08-04 18:01:57 No no .. 
Windows all open and the trick is to heat the oil before adding anything. The raw pungency goes away 
9112 2018-08-04 18:01:34 Switch to flax seed oil if you wanna continue I suppose.

9114 2018-08-04 18:01:27 What is your definition of Socialism?
ND owns a state bank, grain elevators, and looking at an oil refinery. These smart, hardworking folks go for the practical, yet a Red State.
Maybe the president should call them before making a decision.

9126 2018-08-04 17:59:51 Not to mention halal is slaughtering animals in a cruel,  painful totally inhumane way. Islam and western culture are like oil and water.  People should be very afraid what their children and grandchildren are inheriting.  Sad what’s happening to our beautiful Canada 
9127 2018-08-04 17:59:46 McCain a traitor the trump cult certainly has you sucked in. A snake oil man,  he's all smoke and mirrors, starting fires and then playing fire man and taking the credit of being a hero.

9136 2018-08-04 17:59:09 Amazon Prime is an evil lie.  They once delivered my Argan oil deep contioner in 3 days, not the promised 2.
9137 2018-08-04 17:59:07 Living in Colorado as a federal employee is slightly fraught with peril.  Someone almost used CBD oil on me without telling me first.  Likely won't show on a drug test, but I'm not willing to risk my employment!
9138 2018-08-04 17:59:05 I’ve been so addicted to the Josie Maran argan oil.

9144 2018-08-04 17:58:17 Rightly said. Failed to utilize low oil price and applied the brake in economic progress by way of demonetization and faulty implementation of GST.

9157 2018-08-04 17:56:36 Superb crates! I see that the bottom one says "Guaiac"; that is a type of wood. Used in apothecaries (hence the crate ) but also to extract the oil from the wood to use in perfumes. Interesting stuff!

9162 2018-08-04 17:55:46 Why do men always try to teach me things? I had male coworkers try to teach me to shoot guns, drive manual, and change my car oil. They were so excited

9166 2018-08-04 17:55:27 Parklands Refinery has been producing 9X’s the SO2 emissions that Cherry Creek refinery produces, even though they only process half of what Cherry Creek processes. Does it not concern you that the oil companies value the air around Cherry Creek more than around Burnaby Mountain?
9167 2018-08-04 17:55:26  I mean I like coconut curry and coconut milk?? Idk why never coconut shavings/oil (for eating)/water tho hahaha

9173 2018-08-04 17:54:35 Someone suggested cannabis oil against pain, I thought I could at least try. Took it for 3 weeks now and since a few days my pain in my thumbs due to arthrosis is almost gone.

9182 2018-08-04 17:54:02 I would have gone with a finely sliced collard salad seasoned with olive oil, lime, minced garlic and salt. Nice bite to contrast with the fish. Or arugula salad with similar seasoning. Some ideas....
9183 2018-08-04 17:54:01 Right now I am working out options about how to get rid of vegetable oils. Even pomace olive oil is three times more expensive and butter four times more costlier. Keto is difficult in some areas due to non availability of some crucial products
9184 2018-08-04 17:53:51 Butts gives as good as he gets. I would love to learn his journey of discovery from, as head of WWF Canada, he said oil sands should be kept in the ground, to supporting the KM pipeline. Or maybe he doesnt. Odd that no one asks that question.
9185 2018-08-04 17:53:45 They won't explain it with US dependency on Saudi oil and close ties of the saudi royal family to governing elites?
9186 2018-08-04 17:53:44 Glencore did indeed utilize Chinese oil futures. You're incorrect.

9191 2018-08-04 17:52:57 Have you looked at the fake news lately. Your buddy Kim is still making weapons and stock piling oil from your other buddy Putin.
9192 2018-08-04 17:52:54 Pakistan: At least 18 people killed, 35 others injured when a bus collided on with an oil tanker.
9193 2018-08-04 17:52:45 Don't talk about stuff till happens. Oil prices haven't gone down, North Korea hasn't denuclearized.

9195 2018-08-04 17:52:11 We waged wars for oil and we used all the oil waging the wars, inefficiently, in vehicles without emissions controls.  That's the war machine.

9203 2018-08-04 17:51:45 Thing is, what to do when we stop using oil (this doesn't just apply to plastics in food packaging)? Resealable, recycleable, reusable plastic boxes with a return deposit?
9204 2018-08-04 17:51:32 nah it's way bigger than that.  We needed "energy security" and isntead of investing in solar and batteries we invested in FRACKING and COAL and grandfathered everything through 6 terms.  Among other problems.  Because oil companies were allowed to dictate out national policy.

9208 2018-08-04 17:50:30 Any oil that doesn't make landfall in Scotland is counted as "other" most FPSO stuff is pre sold, or goes to spot markets, Rotterdam for instance. Tanker fills up, sails off, "other".........

9217 2018-08-04 17:48:37 A total of 28 trucks for oil transportation have been given to the Turkana community to share. 10 Turkana East, 10 Turkana South, remaining 8 to be allocated to the four constituencies with 2 per each constituency.
9218 2018-08-04 17:48:31 You’ll never get any fruit, nor obedience out of any heart and brain until they are constantly washed in fresh anointing oil. That’s the sons of God’s job, covering all flesh with the Olive Tree.

9222 2018-08-04 17:48:12 Yeah, been searching around a bit and nothing that covers this specific problem. Seems the solution on forums, and here, is to put some oil on the screws!

9225 2018-08-04 17:47:55 It is so rarely enforced. I only just found out that oil containers need to be away from shop fronts because they are a fire hazard! I see them so often, right next to shops!
9226 2018-08-04 17:47:43 really grinds my gears when i see a founder of a company in a capitalist country tries to sell us the snake oil of ANY kind if socialism
9227 2018-08-04 17:47:42 Almost as bad as putting an oil rep in charge of the EPA, or a private school investor in charge of public education

9233 2018-08-04 17:46:57 Thank you for letting us know our worth as human beings lies in the amount of oil we have... How dare we ask for help as mere human beings when we don't have anything to offer. Thanks a lot :)

9350 2018-08-04 17:31:12 Came for an oil change and all of a sudden I need new wipers,an air filter, Cabin filter, and $1000
9351 2018-08-04 17:31:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and these voices to be heard.
9352 2018-08-04 17:31:07 Use of this Oil ?????
9353 2018-08-04 17:31:06 He’s quick with everything. That putt was quick.  Needs to slow down.  This is where some swing oil would help.  Do they make Transfusions on tour?
9354 2018-08-04 17:31:05 Jan Molby stood watching ...less manouvering speed than an oil tanker...
9355 2018-08-04 17:30:52 Dr. Bronner's Organic Lip Balm Naked is great for my kitty's paws. Similar yet simpler ingredients found in commercial paw balms (avocado, jojoba, hemp seed oil, beeswax. tocopherol). So much easier to use.
9356 2018-08-04 17:30:42 He doesn't make decisions on his own. The majority of Canadians support the already approved pipeline. We have more regulations on this stuff than the US does as well. We're not getting off oil anytime soon, we rely on it way too much still.

9359 2018-08-04 17:30:20 Well you will be pleased to know that not only have we discovered large new oil fields, safer fracking should enable us to be oil independent quite soon. Also we can always grow a megafuckton of corn for fuel, in a pinch.

because of greed for oil u ppl killed all in d name of weapon of mass destruction 

If American kiiled it's loose of life, Y others R not humans ?
9365 2018-08-04 17:29:24 Wabara, you haven't been to Kenya, forget your Oil money.. Come to Nairobi, you won't go back to that Lagos, a good number of your country men, are trapped here, they think its London
9366 2018-08-04 17:29:23 Not only should we be preparing for climate change, the UK/Ireland have a chance to not only change our habits but also be at the forefront  of new technologies designed to halt CC. Let's end our reliance on oil/gas. Why be in hock to Middle East and Russia?
9367 2018-08-04 17:29:03 What is this tax cut stage 2.  Is that the capital gains tax cut?  Not going to do anything for me.  My oil bill just went up by $66 month.  Where's improved healthcare?  Fact check!
9368 2018-08-04 17:29:01 According to the principles of Homeopathy it won't do you any good. Oil needs to be diluted and shaken, and diluted and shaken many, many times.
9369 2018-08-04 17:28:54 You bozos just don’t understand that the jobs and revenues from our oil and gas sector directly affects everyone in this country.
9370 2018-08-04 17:28:46 A lot of things are made overseas but that most certainly does not mean everything has to be. Steel, coal, oil, energy and other manufacturing jobs are very important to our country. If you don’t see this then you are the problem.
9371 2018-08-04 17:28:41 Not talking bout lean but I got the mudd I’m selling oil
9372 2018-08-04 17:28:32 Palmers Oil. Soothing and you know how it leaves that subtle rose scent.
9373 2018-08-04 17:28:30 Everytime i get my oil changed before the light even comes on i feel like i have my life together
9374 2018-08-04 17:28:26 We lose money on every transaction. Its okay we can make it up on volume.

9385 2018-08-04 17:26:11 Cbd oil helped me with withdrawal from nicotine, specifically the chronic candy lollipops. Not everyone can feel it, but for me it reduced anxiety/ocd ticcs so much which is what has made me struggle with depression in the past.

Might find it in smoke shops out there.
9386 2018-08-04 17:26:00 You think he will pull more crowd?
9387 2018-08-04 17:25:58 The United States is not comparable to Venezuela. We are the richest country in the world, they are not. Even when they were “oil rich” they live in a dollar-backed world economy. Guess who prints the dollar.
9388 2018-08-04 17:25:36 It's a 62 reissue and I stripped the paint off, and thats what's undeneath believe it or not. Then apply true oil (mineral oil)
9389 2018-08-04 17:25:29 Literally throw all of your hair products away and just get Jamaican castor and extra virgin olive oil. Ur welcome.

9415 2018-08-04 17:22:16 Many of you are still not connecting the dots.  The media is controlled by big industry (bank cartels, oil, WS).  Athletes and celebs are part of the puppeteer globalist plans.  POTUS can't be controlled.  Funded his own campaign & has dirt on GOP & Dems alike.  USA, pls think.

9417 2018-08-04 17:22:04 Bake for 10 to remove any excess over in the process with a pinch of oil in a sheet at room temperature.
9418 2018-08-04 17:21:57 I’ve said it once and I’ll say it until my family stops sitting me down for interventions: it’s not anyone’s business how much coconut oil I go through in one day.
9419 2018-08-04 17:21:54 I like your Oil Panic and Mickey game and watch!
9420 2018-08-04 17:21:30 I wish all Albertan's could visit there so that they see you do not need oil only to survive. So sad during the oil bust that we are not expanding fully into renewable energy right now. Oil controls Alberta's destiny until we diversify it would be easy.
9421 2018-08-04 17:21:26 Like all hell could break loose someone could really bitch me off, but if I just massage my face in coconut oil I’m like all up in my feelings!!! #NoLie #CoconutOilIsLife 
9422 2018-08-04 17:21:17 Yes, let's start a trade war with China and then we act surprised when they buy their oil from Iran instead of the US. It was too hard for Trump to see that one coming.
9423 2018-08-04 17:21:07 but we should take out this oil on our own, we should not allow any other country to take out oil, we have experts who can do it
9424 2018-08-04 17:21:01 Youhome or at work  if your home go get lavender or peppermint oil that usually helps or ice and rub it along your temples, if your at work find some medicine and just sit down for a little while

9428 2018-08-04 17:20:45 Surviving is the easy part. Most of Africa is 'surviving. But have no money for clothes, shoes, oil, sugar, salt, fertilizer or cellphones and TVs.
And most don’t want to farm. Even existence farming is hard and cruel life.
9429 2018-08-04 17:20:42 Are we in Ghana? At least gas is very affordable in Ghana which is why most vehicles r powered with gas in Ghana. If Ghana have one tenth of the oil we have in this country,sure they will buy patrol at N50.

9439 2018-08-04 17:19:43 So that’s all oil revenues except the unassigned oil revenue, which GERS treats as belonging to the U.K.. like whisky exports, food etc. GERS can’t even tell us how much vat is raised in Scotland. So I wouldn’t hold GERS up as a beacon of financial due diligence.

9490 2018-08-04 17:13:28 When Im not pulling oil and gas out of the ground, I study philosophy and history and try to understand how groups of people can become suicidal mass murdering idiots. The idea of "collective consciousness" is integral to that disease.
9491 2018-08-04 17:13:20 #ableg #abed #cdnpoli If @JustinTrudeau is defeated and @AndrewScheer forms the next government then @gmbutts "keep it in the ground" extreme ideology is defeated and we can out compete conflict oil from terror states. #abndp @albertaparty should endorse @CPC_HQ in next Fed Elec
9492 2018-08-04 17:13:20 Half-caf cold brew iced, whirred in the nutribullet with a scoop of MCT oil powder. Thanks for asking :)
9493 2018-08-04 17:13:14 ***SCHOOL SUPPLY DRIVE***
Tri-State Ford of Amarillo, TX. Come by and bring school supplies to our dealership and get a $250 voucher off of a NEW vehicle purchase and 1/2 an oil change from us! (Diesel is excluded).Contact us for more information. Offer ends August 15th.
9494 2018-08-04 17:13:00 Looks like just enough for green shakes, 3 times a day & full bottle of undiluted oil. They're not busy looking in big wine cellars for free tastings to pair up for tonight's cheese party?
9495 2018-08-04 17:12:50 今回のサークルイベントで行ったゲームの細かいルールとかをメモしたから、次やるときはもっとスムーズに進行できそうだ。
やってみないと、わからないところってホント多いよなｗ
9496 2018-08-04 17:12:48 Oil first, corn second.
9497 2018-08-04 17:12:44 I make my #MyModusOperandi with a little olive oil and garlic.
9498 2018-08-04 17:12:36 例えばF=-gradUとか書いた時にUが太字なら間違いだろうね
9499 2018-08-04 17:12:27 I have an idea: Stop sensationalizing everything and just REPORT THE FACTS.
9500 2018-08-04 17:11:56 I could guess at thinking big oil probably would rather see AB a conservative run province which will want to burn more fossil fuel, keep out renewable energy, as well keep oil taxation low, corporate taxation low.
9501 2018-08-04 17:11:37 Sure...until then what? Venezuelan, Iranian, perhaps you'd prefer Russian oil, comrade? Wake up. I stand proudly with him AS we diversify. The oil and gas market WILL be included, boy. Stand aside.
9502 2018-08-04 17:11:21 The entire Whittier neighborhood smell like solvents, oil based ink, cigarettes, and a hint of lavender.
9503 2018-08-04 17:11:13 Looks like a big oil leak 
9504 2018-08-04 17:11:09 Damn it! I moved here after it was closed down
 Can't some rich oil houstonian rebuild for a new generation #RebuildAstroWorld ?
9505 2018-08-04 17:11:02 PH & China on the verge of joint oil exploration in S. China Sea $PXP $APX
9506 2018-08-04 17:10:57 Came up with an engine that if I could build it might change our dependency on oil. Oh the dreams I have
9507 2018-08-04 17:10:49 Tan oil is ridiculously expensive.
9508 2018-08-04 17:10:41 Let’s play a game. 
Who knows what the 3 C’s are in “3C Automotive”? 
If you guess correct, you get a FREE OIL CHANGE!!!!
9509 2018-08-04 17:10:39 Define "energy independent."  My oil company stocks make me feel independent.   ;)
9510 2018-08-04 17:10:38 他大学の話だからそこまでは知らんけど先生が言いたいのはそういうことなんやろうな
9511 2018-08-04 17:10:23 Be a while before a rig is positioned to see if any oil or gas is there. And there will be potential delays if oil/gas price isn’t right for exploitation. Still...  nice to know.
9512 2018-08-04 17:10:22 この前炎龍堂に寄ったらテオさんがお茶出してくれて美味かったぜ～なんかモミアゲ長いねーちゃんがちょっと睨んでたけど(笑)
9513 2018-08-04 17:10:09 Abio,it's a very good suggestion! But he can't, u knw y,dis administration has blcked al oil bloc licences dey use in syphooning our money, to pay salaries for d staffs is nw a prblm (i av someone workn dere)Dats y al of a sudden,dey went back to @OfficialPDPNig so they can loot
9514 2018-08-04 17:10:08 Combine Dijon mustard with our Chipotle Olive Oil and Pineapple White Balsamic to make a Chipotle and Pineapple Grill Marinade on #NationalMustardDay
9515 2018-08-04 17:10:06 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!
9516 2018-08-04 17:10:04 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
9517 2018-08-04 17:09:58 I include a couple of jalapeños for a touch of heat, peel, slice & pack in a jar with oil. Then I too sandwiches or add to salad dressing. I use a lightly greased stove top grill pan & roast slowly not to a full char. Delicious!
9518 2018-08-04 17:09:54 They only let us in when N.Sea oil was discovered & systematically asset stripped us of that & fish stocks ever since
9519 2018-08-04 17:09:51 Neck oil, Getsin enjoy and happy B-Day
9520 2018-08-04 17:09:45 The new rules of straight edge: 
1) You can smoke weed
2) CBD oil 
3 no more since the flood mosh shorts
9521 2018-08-04 17:09:43 It's not even.... it had too much oil in the puff
9522 2018-08-04 17:09:40 Wait?!?!? The oil rig is on VA property, then who is getting the money???
9523 2018-08-04 17:09:27 でもそれよく見るとあれだねー

エネルギーを表す文字を太字で書いてたってことかな？
9524 2018-08-04 17:09:06 A lot of good stuff came out of British Gas R&D Killingworth. And then the offshore industry. Who ever recalls the 80s/90s Tyneside oil& gas platform building boom?!
9525 2018-08-04 17:09:04 なるほど数学の世界と物理の世界の齟齬は解釈の違いなのか
9526 2018-08-04 17:09:04 Does the terminal where they loaded up with crude give an indication who's oil it was that was loaded onto the tanker?
9527 2018-08-04 17:08:54 Some of blocks haven’t been leased, all the oil companies will be chipping in to pay for this but part will also be paid for by surveyor company and available for sale to more than one client, usually called a non-exclusive survey.more detailed surveys often commissioned after.
9528 2018-08-04 17:08:45 I worry at fuel prices being high right now even though it forces responsibility amongst drivers and the vehicles they choose. Could the oil cartel be keeping prices high right now to force change in AB government? They would be blamed for the C tax as well high fuel prices.
9529 2018-08-04 17:08:24 hella oil popped on that ass
9530 2018-08-04 17:08:22 @WarrenBuffett has been pushing for more rail transport of oil.  He has a big vested interest. He owns BNSF railway.  He also has a large stake in @Suncor .  Is that a good reason to fund opposition to the @KinderMorgan Trans Mountain pipeline?
9531 2018-08-04 17:08:19 Ok I can see where that would lower my oil consumption. Looks like you've been tought to hate on banks. Never really understood that one.
9532 2018-08-04 17:08:09 I would rather tip hot oil into my ears than to hear you pretend like you’re a gangster
9533 2018-08-04 17:08:03 And they wonder why #FakeNews is a popular saying 
9534 2018-08-04 17:07:41 Oh do you paint in oil or watercolor?
9535 2018-08-04 17:07:32 Loyalty and Sprint is like water and oil lol. Been a customer since the hen broke wind and got hit with a $300 term fee for one line on a old trap phone I gave my kid for emergency purposes . My contract is up in 3 months 
9536 2018-08-04 17:07:24 Alright them blessed olive oil splashing ppl gonna blow your page up keep it up
9537 2018-08-04 17:07:12 No I haven’t forgot but... What I’am sick of is the lack of accountability on their side 
Republicans must learn to play the same game they do.
We need to stay lock step with one another & demand accountability from their side like they do from us. 
Squeaky wheel gets the oil
9538 2018-08-04 17:06:55 Worked for me! Broke my back in 3 places. No surgery; 6 months in traction. 

Used Rick Simpson oil for reparative affects, CBD for a year after I got out. 

MD said I would need a motorized chair & narcotics to cope.

I get around just fine and no longer take anything. Lucky??
9539 2018-08-04 17:06:53 Your prizewinning show lamb needs nothing more than a bit of salt, a splash of olive oil & oak roasting I reckon @georgioevs tomorrow's task. Looks sooooooo good!
9540 2018-08-04 17:06:43 Seems like the West never really recovered from the OPEC oil crisis of 1973
9541 2018-08-04 17:06:19 Even the oil companies admitted to it in the 80's. Carbon is not the only factor. What other science do you not believe?
9542 2018-08-04 17:06:18 Thought it was a bit odd yesterday that Tsuki's dipstick was dry even after adding 2.5L of new oil. Found out this morning her dipstick is a fucking liar when she started burning oil at higher RPMs. It's overfull.  Had to limp her to a garage to have it corrected come Monday.
9543 2018-08-04 17:06:15 Yea I don’t know anyone who uses oil 
9544 2018-08-04 17:05:56 物理の世界だとやっぱりスカラー量はベクトルじゃない！って習うんだろな。だから減点されてるんだよ
9545 2018-08-04 17:05:53 Burning The Midnight Oil #KU #Invoicing
9546 2018-08-04 17:05:27 ก็พี่ถามว่าสนุกมั้ย
9547 2018-08-04 17:05:25 Okay but animal agriculture isn’t number 1, while it’s part of the number one cause as a whole it falls under the industrial process, which means that animal farming combined with the gases and oil your car is burning while you drive, the process of the concrete you walk on
9548 2018-08-04 17:05:23 ゆっくりしたい…びえ…
最近びっくりするくらい 色が選べなくなってるんだけど 毎日単調な色味のない生活をしてたらそれはそうなりますね と 言う話…(支部さんの改悪からあんまり絵を見なくなったのもある…
9549 2018-08-04 17:05:12 Good job last night buddy glad to see you back in victory lane !!
9550 2018-08-04 17:05:09 Because everybody with a yacht hired twenty more Americans with a living wage, right?  You're a snake oil salesman....from Russia.  With some help from your friends. #Manafort is gonna squeal.  #Cohen is gonna flip.  And the Nation's POS, will FLOP.  ps:  DC Madame has PLENTY!
9551 2018-08-04 17:05:05 Frankincense essential oil is the best shit
9552 2018-08-04 17:04:55 i saw a bumper sticker that just said “olive oil” on it
9553 2018-08-04 17:04:55 @donlemon You should challenge POTUS to a live, televised pop quiz battle on subjects like American History, Civics, Geography, or World History.  Obviously, he’d never accept from fear of being outed for the ignorant snake oil salesman he is, but I’d love to see it.
9554 2018-08-04 17:04:34 “Please use avocado oil to cook my hotdog” - Clarke last night at 3 am
9555 2018-08-04 17:04:30 It's about soul not body as Oil is used and taken by all colour and all genetics. we're on&in natural engine systems Oil is lubricant everyone has been bleeding the earth with no replacement  #the weather. need some Rounded Visitors to help us learn again if ufo know what i mean
9556 2018-08-04 17:04:29 I sleep with insect repellent,  I put malt vinegar on bites , it usually works, also mix tea tree oil with body lotion, as that acts as a repellents,  but ran out, grumpy guts,  said use pickled onion vinegar.
9557 2018-08-04 17:04:28 This coconut oil is very evident I can see clearly now.
9558 2018-08-04 17:04:15 Tara, Tiffany, & I demoed a Harry Potter game and all Tara & I want to do now is keep playing. Tara says it’s just under seeing the Lucas Oil Stadium in awesomeness. #GenCon2018
9559 2018-08-04 17:04:03 So far @RyanJNewman is 9th quickest in final practice. @Lucas_Oil
9560 2018-08-04 17:03:57 There are no coincidences George H Bush was a @cia master spy for years his company zapata oil was a CIA front company there can be little doubt that the remaining classified documents in the JFK assassination reveal Daddy Bush was deeply involved #declassifyJFKdocs @jerome_corsi
9561 2018-08-04 17:03:52 Yes we know about oil crisis and war and how enemies even used kings aur prince of KSA to get control on oil. Iran and China are more proactive in protecting their country against all kinds of threats. Now India and Afghanistan is used against Pakistan for this evil purpose.
9562 2018-08-04 17:03:42 Damn it. I keep forgetting to send you that oil. Sorry. Love you my asthma twin. 
9563 2018-08-04 17:03:31 I think long term it will. And I know it will but the thought of putting oil in your mouth makes me sick.
9564 2018-08-04 17:03:30 We're like goldfish. Give more room to human society, watch it grow into it. Lol.

I believe same has been observed with cars getting ever more efficient. Essentially miles driven went up, oil consumption didn't go down as much.
9565 2018-08-04 17:03:21 テンソルの中にも含まれてるな。大学以降では線型結合が考えられるものをベクトルと言うんだよ。そんなこと習わないよね
9566 2018-08-04 17:03:01 My dad was a tease.  Being the youngest I was his favorite target.  It was extremely important to him that I check my oil regularly so he would test me.

Dad: “Ok, show me the dipstick.”

Me: “It’s right there dad.” (Pointing at dipstick)

Dad: “I see it too.” (Pointing at me)
9567 2018-08-04 17:02:50 Wtf? Can you live a single day without big oil? Just kys

9571 2018-08-04 17:02:19 I like how @jjcromag plugged @ForksOverKnives in reference to oil being harmful to the diet and @joerogan let the plug go through with no words in opposition. #trolled
9572 2018-08-04 17:02:15 I used to but that ages ago but it wasn’t marketed as a jacket topper. It made for yummy sandwiches. Right now I’m a bit obsessed with Lidl’s jars of albacore tuna in olive oil. Perfect for anything

9576 2018-08-04 17:01:53 RipOffReport is reliable.  So much damn eye cream / snake oil SCAMS out there.

Anyone who sells any of this garbage should be charged with fraud.
9577 2018-08-04 17:01:25 I am out of butter so half the corn has olive oil and the other half has garlic spread and both worked out way better than expected
9578 2018-08-04 17:01:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or enforce our laws.
9579 2018-08-04 17:01:06 First #dearcustomer of the day sets the tone:
Do you do oil changes here?
9580 2018-08-04 17:01:04 テンソルって言えばいいのか

9585 2018-08-04 17:00:48 Hahaha! Thy overran it, oil peak exceeded! 
9586 2018-08-04 17:00:46 ใครเค้าเอาเรื่องแบบนี้มาพูดกันครับ
9587 2018-08-04 17:00:42 probably eaten by now, but Just fry it altogether with some olive oil until the aubergine is really soft, yum...
9588 2018-08-04 17:00:28 08/04: Corn, pasilla pepper, onion, mozzarella & Valbreso feta cheese; garnished with garlic olive oil, cilantro & fresh lime
9589 2018-08-04 17:00:26 The other half to healthcare increases. The tax cut winners are big pharma & big oil while middle America tries to keep treading the same financial water.
9590 2018-08-04 17:00:24 Best realization was using the bacon oil to cook the eggs in.

9593 2018-08-04 17:00:13 Dad (who shaves his head): lemme see your hair oil.
Me: okay [wait a minute]
Me: you want my hair oil?*grabs hair milk*
Dad: I need to use it.
Me:YOU, want to use my hair oil?
9594 2018-08-04 17:00:09 It’s cooking oil haha. Works well as a lubricant haha
9595 2018-08-04 17:00:05 RT #RealStrongfacts: Guess the box heck chart is an easy to breath. Though I'm more wise to play oil and trade relations.

9597 2018-08-04 16:59:52 Damn I wanna try CBD oil but its a cannabis oil.
9598 2018-08-04 16:59:50 ลองใช้ cleansing oil ของ THREE ทำให้ต้องชะงักแผนซื้อ Clinique cleansing Balm ไปก่อน ... แต่เอาจริงไม่รู้ว่าอะไรมันจะเวิ้กกว่าา ชั่งใจมากจริงๆ
9599 2018-08-04 16:59:49 Investing on oil & property is the only thing that I wanna do in few years time.
9600 2018-08-04 16:59:20 They are not under US sanctions (yet) and are likely more interested in shorting the USD at this time. Judging the oil/yuan contract on the basis of its "market share" relative to USD-denominated oil purchases completely misses the point (and power) of a petroyuan alternative.
9601 2018-08-04 16:59:18 The dredging of the ocean bottom for the sake of deep oil drilling, the oil spills. These things are causing true damage. The earth is billions of years old and has gone through several ice ages and warmings. These things go ignored. 2/2
9602 2018-08-04 16:59:12 I don't think the top 1% is too interested in getting one of the 3 million jobs Trump created or that the coal & oil industries are up & running & I don think the care abt the lowest unemployment for Latinos & blacks in history.
9603 2018-08-04 16:58:35 I need to go get a oil change but don’t feel it ugh !
9604 2018-08-04 16:58:34 For me the best things in that moment are sounds and smell. I always carry perppermint oil and headphones with me so the oil can help clear my head and slow things down, while I also play white noise sounds in my headphones to distract from what’s actually happening

9606 2018-08-04 16:58:13 腹痛で汗だくになってしまった
9607 2018-08-04 16:58:07 Check and compare the price of oil during Obasanjo's era and Pmb's era, that should give an insight. Don't believe in subsidy though!
9608 2018-08-04 16:58:06 Go and educate yourself, the oilsands (not tarsands) are not the worst in the world, in fact they're the most ethically produced in the world! I see you don't care about any other oil in the world! Why is that? Do you have a car? A phone, a laptop, anything that uses oil?
9609 2018-08-04 16:58:05 We don't need tyrants, fake news, or snake oil salespeople. Freedom suffices.

9610 2018-08-04 16:58:03 Because different refineries in different locations need different grades of oil, produced in other countries. Meanwhile, our production is growing, so we have more export opportunities. These are complex markets that can't be managed in a top-down fashion. That's capitalism.
9611 2018-08-04 16:57:58 Imo is an oil state
9612 2018-08-04 16:57:58 kok gada make up remover yg bener2 cocok di muka gw ya.. mulai dr yg kek micellar water, oil based, sm yg campuran... smuanya nyisain bercak2 merah yg gatel gitu di muka gw. #tanyakenapa
9613 2018-08-04 16:57:57 Good morning sir. We are reminded that diplomacy and global relations require cool heads, hard study and discipline. It would be nice to have a leader who was burning the midnight oil reading "Foreign Policy for Dummies", etc. instead of picking fights with other public figures.
9614 2018-08-04 16:57:52 Congratulations. Your car has apex seals that will swell and leak because of the synthetic oil
9615 2018-08-04 16:57:47 A bugatti veyron’s oil change costs $21,000 and takes 27 hours it could be worse

9618 2018-08-04 16:57:40 So then the oil barons should have to pay that money back

9623 2018-08-04 16:56:47 actually apple has "free" press in its pocket. even though their hardware is mediocre, "free" press will try to push it under the rug. @SamsungMobile has the best phone hardware, but US "free" press keep talking -tively about samsung. @AppleSupport Mr. Trump is right about "FAKE"

9629 2018-08-04 16:56:23 @AshaRangappa_ 
What’sshappening to US is very simple;First is apathy the American electorate is tired & wants change, this has cause the total no participation. Second is the pervasive corruption in our society.The FBI/DOJ is the “oil” that keeps this great nationof ourshumming.
9630 2018-08-04 16:56:20 i just left a moroccan oil mask in my hair for an hour and a half. u could say im a new woman

9633 2018-08-04 16:56:00 No Don, they don’t!  Just like they don’t believe in any other part of the Constitution.  Trump is a snake oil salesman selling out America to Putin.  He’s hoping to divide America & form a dictatorship!
9634 2018-08-04 16:55:56 Technology and I get along about as well as oil and water, so your skill just blows me away.
9635 2018-08-04 16:55:24 Been a male medic in oil and gas for long time. I support the lgbt movment. Why can't we start a gay oilfield confessions page. 90 percent of the time your husband boyfriend booty call is bi. Only 10 percent are straight...
9636 2018-08-04 16:55:23 @RobertoReHRD So you are lying to me. You are not drilling for oil of the coast of Maine if you tweet you are travelling. How was Miami and New York? Laurie Becker

9639 2018-08-04 16:55:01 Those of you who BBQ:  one of my favorite marinades uses a lot of olive oil, which seems to cause a lot of flareups.  Any ideas on how prevent? Is it just as simple as turning down the heat?
9640 2018-08-04 16:55:01 Stole the coconut oil for my legs and now I’m walking around smelling like a bounty bar
9641 2018-08-04 16:54:56 Olive oil is the best and delicious.

9644 2018-08-04 16:54:53 i made a fire in the kitchen and burned my finger trying to see how hot the oil was on the pan...
9645 2018-08-04 16:54:48 The more tightly your clothing fits against your body, the more it will trap dirt, oil &amp; sweat on your skin, which could cause body acne.
9646 2018-08-04 16:54:46 This is getting beyond my areas of expertise. Most examples of nationalization I can think of are ideologically based, like Communism, or at least partially ideologically-based, such as the nationalist/anti-colonial nationalizations related to oil industry. But NOT AN EXPERT.

9652 2018-08-04 16:54:04 I would have loved to. Had an oil class & a birthday party. Just now getting me some on the way to the party. Maybe next time! 
9653 2018-08-04 16:53:55 During the tenure of Barack Obama the USA produced and exceeded its Crude Oil needs for the first time!

Good for the economy! Good for everyone!

Trump's Tax Cut steals money from Government coffers and puts it in individual pockets!

No good for the economy!
Good for the rich!

9656 2018-08-04 16:53:17 I’m getting my oil changed and my tires rotated today, and I walk into the office and a lady brought her dog that I get to play with, my day is MADE.
9657 2018-08-04 16:52:57 #Saudi_Arabia’s decision to resume oil shipment through the strait of Bab al-Mandeb was made after taken necessary measures to protect commercial ships to guarantee international trade movement.

9666 2018-08-04 16:51:06 the oil can solves hangovers!
9667 2018-08-04 16:51:05 Coconut oil is the solution to all problems. 

If I was quoting someone, it’d be @AAbojaradeh
9668 2018-08-04 16:51:03 I literally hate having to take my car in to get oil changes.
9669 2018-08-04 16:50:52 i switch it up! first you have to decide if you want it to be butter or olive oil, or both! OR, maybe you want to do fresh ricotta or burratta or st. marcellin or goat cheese, or brie... or fromage blanc or creme fraiche (some of these can take an olive oil drizzle later).
9670 2018-08-04 16:50:50 What nonsense. The Scotland Bill was passed in 2016. Smith was signed up to by the SNP. There were no lies to secure a No vote. But the yes campaign lied all the time - about oil, EU, defence, research funding, pensions......
9671 2018-08-04 16:50:48 We should all get badges for little adulthood accomplishments. For example, today I’m earning the “find shit to do while waiting for your oil to be changed” badge
9672 2018-08-04 16:50:30 please let there be oil.....please for the love of god
9673 2018-08-04 16:50:28 Like coal, oil and gas are a dead end as fuel for electricity production and ground transportation. Per MW installed, solar PV and wind are now competitive with nat gas and will continue to decline in cost. Multi-band solar PV will increase conversion efficiencies by at least 50%
9674 2018-08-04 16:49:56 Neem oil, dude.  I can hook you up with the good shit for your replacement.  No hope for this one though.

9679 2018-08-04 16:49:10 Apparently an iScotland could depend on 96.5% of oil resource on separation.

What does 96.5% of oil mean in £ms (aside from a high %age) ?

Swinney forecast between £6.7 - 7.9bn.
9680 2018-08-04 16:49:07 I used a small amount of the bluecheese dressing from Whole Foods. I almost always choose a lemon wedge and a little olive oil. But I like treat myself Friday’s 
9681 2018-08-04 16:49:06 Me, dumb: People need homes, we should build more homes where there are already homes. 

You, smart: There's no difference between living next to an apartment building and an oil refinery.
9682 2018-08-04 16:48:37 Democrat Pacific North West states now reliant on sanction-busting Putin misery oil, in part because of successful US-based anti-Canada campaigns? Quite the storyline.
9683 2018-08-04 16:48:35 @CynthiaNixon there is no such thing as democratic socialism. quit trying to sell snake oil as pepsi. just doesn't work
9684 2018-08-04 16:48:27 Companies like oil companies that have relied on socialism in the form of govt subsidies and tax breaks? Those kinds of companies?

9686 2018-08-04 16:48:16 Of course they will. India has already cut back on Iranian oil and increased US purchases for example.
9687 2018-08-04 16:48:07 #PalmOil is only a problem because the #EU insists that 10% of #diesel is #biodiesel and that is fuelling unsustainable palm oil production. (pun intended!) Glass jars are re-useable. Not sure about the cap, Geoff!
9688 2018-08-04 16:47:58 just put oil in my car so I guess I’m a professional mechanic now

9690 2018-08-04 16:47:42 What you truly need to know is who slept with whom in the caves thousands of years ago, this is nothing more than modern day SNAKE OIL being sold to snake watchers looking for someone to bite or get bitten, buy at your own STUPIDITY.

9717 2018-08-04 16:44:40 explanation fo “draconian” cost-cutting measures to Coast Guard: enforcing environmental laws in US waters, like protecting endangered ocean species, preventing illegal dumping of harmful chemicals, stopping oil spills & stemming invasive species.

9719 2018-08-04 16:44:21 scoop about 1 tbsp of coconut oil & oil of oregano comes in a dropper bottle, so i’d do 5-10 drops. then put the mix on your feet after you wash.

9722 2018-08-04 16:43:34 The media was quite upset about LNG shipments to Boston from RF that were "laundered" through a French company; seems very similar. Not sure if the Russian(?) company that pumped the oil is actually under sanctions at all, but it proves the point; oil doesn't carry a passport ;)

(BTW was THAT a factual/truthful statement?
9761 2018-08-04 16:38:40 Why would I have put on body oil prior to coming out in the sun?? Why??
9762 2018-08-04 16:38:32 No, not a new subject. It's just explaining the hypocrisy of the Right. They run on "Small Government" "Fiscal Conservatism" but practice neither. More spending, more breaks for major corporations because "Trickle Down", and welfare for conservative groups. Oil, Farming etc.
9763 2018-08-04 16:38:19 Nothing like calling your dad after getting an oil change in the car and letting him know that they said “the car is in excellent shape!”
9764 2018-08-04 16:38:14 Say what? That is absurd. Iranian oil buyers will never buy from US.
9765 2018-08-04 16:38:13 My only disappointment with owning @Ford is trying to get an oil change at the dealership
9766 2018-08-04 16:37:47 The Becel Olive Oil one is really good! Got it for my Dad when he was living with me in the final stages of cancer (he couldn't have butter) and I got to like it.

When I was growing up, though, we had nothing but Imperial margarine.  Their Canadian commercials were a hoot.

9770 2018-08-04 16:37:21 @motul Can't we deserve a 15w50 oil grade of Motul 7100 series ? In India, there is a Huge demand for 15w50 for Royal Enfield but there is no 15w50 for 7100.. Pls give us 7100 15w50 Full Synthetic. We need that as 300v is too expensive @royalenfield
9771 2018-08-04 16:37:17 My wife has made me do this thing called oil pulling and its worse like how exactly it sounds.
9772 2018-08-04 16:37:01 Friend you see my la legs tryna shine in the sun  like baby oil baby.
9773 2018-08-04 16:37:00 Russia wants to re-arrange the world order by: 1) maximizing its oil revenue, 2) creating a strong counterpoint to Western orgs like EU, NATO, UN, 3) partner with China & other autocrats, 4) weaken the US - economy, intl standing & domestic unity, 5) weaken press credibility

9777 2018-08-04 16:36:08 PSA: if you need an oil change and like getting your hands dirty, AutoZone has full synthetic with a filter for like $28, plus another $10 rebate.
9778 2018-08-04 16:35:55 omg i should dead ass come to avonlea and make them a fuckin curry chip like gimmie oil and a few potatoes and i’d get to work

9780 2018-08-04 16:35:39 — USE A BODYLOTION ON YOUR WHOLE BODY THAT IT GETS SOFT AND SHINY 
— PUT A HAIR OIL IN YOUR HAIR AND BRUSH THEM LONG SO THERE WON‘T BE ANY NODES 
— MAKE YOUR HAIR DRY WITH A TOWEL ( DO NOT USE HAIR BLOWERS THAT OFTEN BECAUSE THEY LET YOUR HAIR DRY OUT AND BREAK THEM )
9781 2018-08-04 16:35:37 ... c'est juste être un idiot utile de Big Oil, Big Gas et Big Coal, voire pire...
9782 2018-08-04 16:35:36 Russia helping N Korea cheating on sanctions with oil transfers at sea and hiring them from the government of N korea. Trump is a fool.

9788 2018-08-04 16:35:06 i have oily skin and it doesnt really hold off the oil BUT foundation/bb cushion sits well on it :)

9790 2018-08-04 16:35:03 Is Durbin and Schumer now selling snake oil? He conjures up images of seedy  profiteers trying to exploit an unsuspecting public by selling it fake  sentiment for his own gain.
9791 2018-08-04 16:34:59 "they say oil and water don't mix, now they all down at the beach washing off the fish"
9792 2018-08-04 16:34:59 Coco mango shea butter for my body. Aloe Vera gel mixed w lemon essential oil on my face. Cream Of Nature’s Pure Honey line on my hair. Schmidts lavender + sage natural deodorant.
9793 2018-08-04 16:34:46 I don't like the smell of ghee. I have white butter very rarely. My cooking uses Rice Bran Oil and Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
9794 2018-08-04 16:34:46 Explain to me why the state-owned Chinese oil companies don’t use it. End of story
9795 2018-08-04 16:34:41 It’s like buying a Ferrari and complaining about getting an oil change
9796 2018-08-04 16:34:31 Oil to the 200 is changed got my new stickers and batteries for the keys, now I just a need a new air filter and good car wash
9797 2018-08-04 16:34:27 Is Schumer now selling snake oil? He conjures up images of seedy  profiteers trying to exploit an unsuspecting public by selling it fake  sentiment for his own gain.

9802 2018-08-04 16:33:28 i miss that summer where everyone went wild bc their coconut oil melted
9803 2018-08-04 16:33:23 So now you needed to compare the quantity of crude produced. Not about your general Oil producing States claim. 
You still don't rate your followers, if you think capturing 1 major "oil" producing State is what the APC is after with the Akpabio card.
9804 2018-08-04 16:33:22 How to make it rain in New England:
1) Take your car to get an oil change.
2) When they say it'll be 45 minutes say, "No worries, I'll take a nice walk."
3) Wander off to Target, Newsbreak, McDonald.
4) Really get far away from the shop.
5) Sky gone open UP.
6) Sing in the rain.
9805 2018-08-04 16:33:17 Lol no. Apple sells lots of plastic an quess what. Plastic comes from oil
9806 2018-08-04 16:33:15 Most of the gains are in oil and energy I don't see anything in this article that suggests what you are implying

9808 2018-08-04 16:33:08 Got to REBUILD the Head smoking and blowing and burning oil to the top side
9809 2018-08-04 16:32:50 This is the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen. Most homes are heated by natural gas, a relatively clean burning fuel. This pipeline is carrying bitumen, a very dirty and inefficient oil. Lmao
9810 2018-08-04 16:32:45 If your invested in anglo african oil and gas, another company you might want to watch is mosman oil and gas. 30-60 days until production facilities are installed at which point the flow rate will confirm, inital 150bopd still expected. #msmn #aaog
9811 2018-08-04 16:32:44 That’s not true...when you go out to restaurants, most of the food will be cooked in “vegetable oil” which is just a term for either soy and/or canola. 98% of soy in the United States is GMO.
9812 2018-08-04 16:32:43 Interesting one! Shows more into you than the (beautiful) oil chemical type of things I saw before
9813 2018-08-04 16:32:12 brhamin's of UP and bihar are responsible for this decline. they are very selfish, self-centric and cunning people. they live for only themselves. open history books and read the details, these brhamins were ahead in boot licking muslim rules and british rulers.
9814 2018-08-04 16:32:09 To you. Every oil change I’ve gotten before this was $25.
9815 2018-08-04 16:31:39 Dark Knight got new tires and an oil change for my car. So much better!

9818 2018-08-04 16:31:24 Even at this rate, development of fuel-less, diesel-less cars and automobile will send oil producing nations packing. When PMB said he hopes corruption doesn’t kill Nigeria, I knew it was deep...I don’t know about the workings of oil & all but I know Nigeria better cub corruption
9819 2018-08-04 16:31:23 It is quite obvious that both parties need a make over and a new writer to preach the virtue of holy trinities and one party takes holy trinities and the other takes golden key and yet what happen to Zappa Oil Drilling Services and how is this related to the new recruit orientat

9838 2018-08-04 16:27:57 I like the watercolor and oil number 20. 
9839 2018-08-04 16:27:54 so been doing it  wrong. should be moisturizer then oil.
9840 2018-08-04 16:27:36 They're putting pressure on Akpabio using all kinds of stuffs including blackmail to have him move to APC. APC desperately needs one oil State. They can't get Rivers, Delta & Bayelsa so they need Akwa Ibom. The former Governor just told me now he is not going to APC!

9843 2018-08-04 16:27:00 I think we need to hijack it and make it into crap Obama did.

9845 2018-08-04 16:26:51 Its a biopic in essence. There are no cowboys or sheriffs or deputies or any of that stuff. There's no one moving cattle. It's about an oil baron and his determination to succeed. Not a Western, my friend.

9848 2018-08-04 16:25:59 Raw size is irrelevant. All it ever needed to become was a viable (and inviolable) "escape hatch" for the sanctions-power of USD hegemony. To the extent Russia, Iran, Venezuela et al. can sell oil to China for RMB (and/or gold?), the petroyuan kills the petrodollar. End of story.
9849 2018-08-04 16:25:54 I know!! But I actually told them exactly what I wanted and what oil to use and somehow i still got gypped

9853 2018-08-04 16:25:26 Not for YOU, ya goddamn batshit old woodsman! You smell of scorched engine oil!
9854 2018-08-04 16:25:25 If you really think about it, the only reason that the EV subsides exist is due to the oil one's, if oil wasn't subsidized there would be no need to give incentives to go green, they would already be far superior cost wise to consumer, and are already approaching that anyway.
9855 2018-08-04 16:25:21 Wanna go with me to get my oil change 
9856 2018-08-04 16:25:15 Stood what ground? They’ve been a big oil party for decades. That is their “ground.”

9860 2018-08-04 16:25:02 That same thing happened to me at Kwik Kar. I walked in and asked for a $19.99 oil change and when they were done my total was like $45.

9866 2018-08-04 16:23:59 Scientists agree that today’s warming is primarily caused by humans putting too much carbon in the atmosphere, like burning coal, oil, and gas, or cutting down forests. You don’t agree with them, so be it

9869 2018-08-04 16:23:42 I can kinda dig it, but I like all kinds of dongs.

I first heard about the olive oil thing as a way to clean out smegma (not directly pictured here) from a friend who used to have phimosis. Since then, I've also seen it advised around the Internet, so it's good I guess.
9870 2018-08-04 16:23:38 prayer circle that this place finishes my oil change before I gotta go to work
9871 2018-08-04 16:23:33 I love Japan's anime! I hate my left hand is very firm, you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
9872 2018-08-04 16:23:15 Yg complain oily2 xbest.thats an oil.Ofcozlah ada oil properties yg lekit2.Anyway...natur E really works on scars. Pastikan your purpose nak pakai the product utk settlekan mslh u yg mana,then pilih product yg betul.
9873 2018-08-04 16:23:13 Yeah - bad. I’m pretty sure there are ethics standards that apply. This may be compliant... technically. Nonetheless, this is a blatant conflict. It sure looks like corruption, and merits investigation. DiNapoli could remove concern by divesting from oil/gas, including Williams.
9874 2018-08-04 16:23:02 よかった、あってた笑
9875 2018-08-04 16:22:49 Yes if you want to use an oil. For me personally I don’t have to use one
9876 2018-08-04 16:22:44 Increase in oil price and huge taxation in it and added taxation if busy sectors along with increase in AAI fee are reasons too
9877 2018-08-04 16:22:44 How did they make it to the run way

9885 2018-08-04 16:21:06 To be fair, we germaphobes tend to also be disgusted by the thought of having touched our hands on subway poles where snot and sweat and smelly body oil is rubbed all over every day, regardless of microbial content. It's like when my daughter used to rub the souls of her
9886 2018-08-04 16:20:49 That was smart. I heard somewhere to keep palms wet, but that def wasn't enough. Will try oil for the next batch.

9905 2018-08-04 16:19:27 Of course it does, but theologically it’s impossible, and snake oil salesmen like Maajid know that too, but ‘hope’ sells and it sells good. That’s why he fears the likes of Tommy so much.

9908 2018-08-04 16:19:05 Yeah for me the dough never quite got non-sticky even though I kneaded it for several minutes. I ended up rubbing some olive oil on my palms when actually rolling/shaping it to avoid stickiness.

Sulfates, parabens, phthalates, parrafins, mineral oil, propylene, formaldehyde all should be avoided.
9913 2018-08-04 16:18:33 #crackerbarrel is over priced rural tourist trap fare. Tastes like Granny confused the pinesol bottle for cooking oil anyway.

Weird timing for a NFP who didn't ask for any money??

9932 2018-08-04 16:16:00 Today's CyberJoke 3000™

A blonde told the auto parts clerk, "Do you have a longer dipstick for a Toyota?" The puzzled clerk responded, "Why do you need a longer dipstick?" She said, "Because this one no longer reaches the oil!"
9933 2018-08-04 16:15:54 In my case, I force my parents to eat healthy, like using little oil, ghee and butter in their cooking. But they don't listen. FOr example what's the point of putting white butter or ghee on rotis? Also on a non stick pan if a dosa can be made without using any oil, why put it?

9946 2018-08-04 16:14:29 I am assuming next week will be a very bearish week as we ended strong and are in correction territory. Oil for one, should reverse sharply and so, DXY will soar and so, the S&P 500 should drop good. It's worth shorting on any rises (in small size) and adding on a breakdown..

9956 2018-08-04 16:13:08 Oh yea you wouldn’t put raw flower in. You’d decarboxylate, infuse into coconut oil, strain and put that into the caps. Lots of people don’t know about it, which is why we like helping spread the good info!! :)
9957 2018-08-04 16:13:03 When your president babbles about hoaxes & fake news he’s giving u the bread crumbs. U have to find the truth elsewhere cuz you aren’t going to get it in full from the MSM.

9977 2018-08-04 16:10:16 That’s my guess as well. ExxonMobile is basically in the LNG business in Pakistan and to my knowledge was not doing any oil exploration.

Prior to Obasanjo, no other govt since his military days did anything about power. Effectively, he inherited what he left in '79 in its dilapidated form. Yes they stole, but they kick-started power reforms via MYTO 1 & 2.

10022 2018-08-04 16:05:09 I don't care. Once you murder over 1.1 million people, many of which were British soldiers, all of his past achievements go out of the window. You obviously didn't have any friends or family who were killed by Blairs oil war in Iraq, because if you did you wouldn't brush it off.
