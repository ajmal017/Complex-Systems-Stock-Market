11 2018-03-07 23:50:45 How am I disagreeing with anything the constitution says? Nowhere in the constitution does it say that bump stocks are a given right to all Americans, thus it is not unconstitutional for Inslee to place a ban on them

38 2018-03-07 23:45:37 It sure seems like the only thing they worry about these days is MONEY.  Money that benefits them from the NRA, stocks, tax breaks for the wealthy etc etc.

55 2018-03-07 23:30:25 A drop in the Dow is significant.  Shame on you...The Dow is only 30 stocks and hardly an accurate picture of our economy these days.  Want me to send you my meager investments?  I am not rich but my investments have tumbled due to Trump's  unstable economics.

64 2018-03-07 23:19:07 Trump agreed with democrats to limit assault rifles,put age to 21,ban bump stocks and  bring background checks I really thought the old bugger had a foray into the sane world ,but the next day he changed topic and threatened to scuttle nafta and impose steel tariffs.Sanity faded
65 2018-03-07 23:17:04 the last game would still matter more than the first. A win changing the set odds 0% makes no sense to me. Being more likely to win when you're in the lead is common sense. Just like the person who's up 3-1 stocks is more likely to win.
66 2018-03-07 23:16:56 Does it include banning assault rifles? And bump stocks? And the ability to purchase guns at gun shows without proper background checks?
67 2018-03-07 23:15:57 That's fine, but I'd be investing in things other than stocks.
68 2018-03-07 23:15:04 No damn body needs an AR 15, period. The vast majority of cops agree with this, along with background checks, no extended mags, and bump stocks. It's simple. No way a street cop should be outgunned by the wing nuts in our country.
69 2018-03-07 23:14:49 The 264 point (+2.2%) rally seen in DAX Futures so far this week marks the strongest start to a week in the 45 weeks since 26 April 2017 #stocks
70 2018-03-07 23:14:36 What does your average middle class Republican get from oil companies? Are they all employed there? I own oil stocks (or did), that doesn't change how science works. Fear of change? I'm afraid change, I hate change. That doesn't impact my view of carbon dioxide.
71 2018-03-07 23:13:50 Time to go and and buy bump stocks.
72 2018-03-07 23:13:24 "Bar research material the [UK] stocks were destroyed long since." I recall the announcement, and I recall Putin's announcement of the same last September.

74 2018-03-07 23:12:57 I wonder what the founders would think of an elected governor saying that about an organization that protects the Constitution. They'd have flogged him and put him in stocks

83 2018-03-07 23:10:22 What a shock...... Tennessee state Senate declines to even hear a bill today to make bump stocks illegal in Tennessee. One Democratic Senator walked out in protest for the law not being heard. It is a sad statement from our law makers. We must all protest for the safety of all.

85 2018-03-07 23:09:27 How do you see that?  How is banning semi-automatic weapons a threat to your livelihood?   How is enforcing background checks a bad thing?  How is a ban on bump stocks and extended clips reducing your safety?

91 2018-03-07 23:07:06 US stocks ended mixed on Wednesday, with gains in most heavyweight techs helping offset broad losses in retailers and industrial shares as the risks of a trade war mounted. Trading volumes were thinner than usual as another heavy storm brewed in the north-east of the US.
92 2018-03-07 23:06:20 Why don't you ask him why he hasn't signed the bill banning bump stocks yet? He said he would do it himself, write the bill banning bump stocks. Has he? No, he hasn't and he won't.
93 2018-03-07 23:06:15 It’s not insider trading. He sold his personal property not stocks. Him selling had no direct affect on share price.

99 2018-03-07 23:04:16 The issue here is that the gun lobby always gets their way because they buy elected public servants who are supposed to serve #wethepeople Anyone who is arguing against a ban on auto/semi-auto/bump-stocks/etc and claiming to be a victim should be ashamed of themselves.

104 2018-03-07 23:01:23 I wouldn't advise anyone to suddenly dump all their stocks (tho obviously it worked well for you!). But, for example, we pulled $ out of our house in a refi, to diversify into more than r.e. -- but I'm inclined to leave it in cash until long after the market tanks. Wise?

110 2018-03-07 22:59:27 Its been reported in the news that the Congressional pharmacy stocks Alzheimer's medication for certain Congressional persons. Perhaps she's one - some of her comments and mis-comments would suggest she's having some major problems!

138 2018-03-07 22:45:08 10 years of constant 6 figure salaries gives you time to invest and build on interest of the money you choose to put in stocks or the bank. Plus 2 million at one time can disappear a lot faster than 192,000 a year

140 2018-03-07 22:42:54 Me personally I don’t have a problem with them raising the age to 21 but not to 25. Also I haven’t any vested interest in bump stocks. To me a bump stock is an accessory that doesn’t infringe on my #2A rights so I could care less if they did away with them.
141 2018-03-07 22:42:47 Yeah, Carl Icahn, you’re just prescient like that; just felt it was a good day to suddenly dump stocks. No insider trading here
142 2018-03-07 22:42:46 ^^ this. I put a large amount into crypto, but I capped my Usd investment.  Future money will go into stocks.  I also own my own business

147 2018-03-07 22:39:16 They only have one playbook, and that is that is that stocks should always advance over the long run, but in a stair step fashion. Therefore, straight up is unsustainable, and pullbacks are buying opportunities. Not very helpful, but it is simple and straightforward.

156 2018-03-07 22:38:23 Lithium stocks probably do well over the coming months.
157 2018-03-07 22:37:58 Actually, I've read how heads of corporations are using the money from tax breaks to buy more stocks. Not really helping anyone but themselves.

163 2018-03-07 22:35:13 hello mr. ricky! my my name is marcus and this is my first twt ever. my question is have you heard of stocks to trade and if so whats the difference between sink or swim. its 179.00 monthly and im just starting out with little money. its designed by timothy sykes
164 2018-03-07 22:35:11 Ban any and all assault rifles, stricter background checks, 25 or older to buy a gun, 2 week waiting period to buy a gun, mental health screenings and ban bump stocks. Let’s start there.
165 2018-03-07 22:35:01 More than 47,794 people have asked credit card companies to stop processing payments from retailers that sell assault weapons, bump stocks, and extended ammo clips. @Discover, will you do your part to help stop mass murders?
166 2018-03-07 22:34:30 Says the guy who stocks the fridge at home with Leinenkugel's Shandy...
167 2018-03-07 22:34:11 And Carl you regularly dumped such stocks monthly or is this the first time?
168 2018-03-07 22:32:41 Lyin Ted Cruz when you were asked if you supported getting rid of bump stocks and tougher background checks you said you supported neither one. That is disgraceful and so are you! You keep saying that we need to take care of things so Mass murders don't continue but you don't
169 2018-03-07 22:32:19 People are being funny and silly and too political. If we get rid of gun stocks, why not Buffet’s Coke whose liquid sugar has caused millions of innocent people suffer from diabetes and die each year, never mind expensive healthcare fees; same with tobacco and alcohol stocks...

173 2018-03-07 22:30:27 We've never banned all SAs.  Banning Bump Stocks is silly, one can just go buy other modifications.  Better to put limits on allowable firing rates.

178 2018-03-07 22:26:22 I’d buy you stocks. You need something you can’t break or ruin or mess up. Oh and the way cars depreciate it would be a waste of money. So sorry. Your getting freaking bitcoin

187 2018-03-07 22:21:12 Market faded early as investors were grieving the departure of Gary Cohn (a man 98% of the populous never heard of) from POTUS' inner circle.  Stocks recovered led by the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 - Dow and S&P were sloppy all day but ticked up some late in the day.

193 2018-03-07 22:18:47 Snope is a joke. He sold stocks. WE ALL KNOW THAT. That doesn't need a fact check. What needs a fact check is if he was trading with insider info.

194 2018-03-07 22:18:33 Tricky market just stick with your strongest stocks. Personally I like Micron and MTZ. So much propaganda shadowing the fundamentals for now. 
   Give Trump some credit he's not a stupid businessman unlike most politicians.
195 2018-03-07 22:17:07 But legal precedent already exists, before during and after statistics to back it up. Banning bump stocks will be MUCH harder to get through legal channels than a ban we've already had before.

201 2018-03-07 22:14:37 @realDonaldTrump You said two weeks ago that you were going to sign an executive order that would ban bump stocks. That it would be easy. I am disappointed that you haven't done it yet.

210 2018-03-07 22:11:20 Crypto stocks and some info tech sure, dunno about whole market tho. I only say this as there’s several co’s larger than the entirety of the crypto market. But the main stock liquidation I see is from those knee deep margin on a coin needing to liquidate funds elsewhere.

214 2018-03-07 22:08:53 No one is arguing about bump stocks. They are pointless to have. We already have a universal background check. Every gun transaction is approved through the FBI. Universal gun registration, just no, it serves no purpose except to give the government a leg up on full confiscation.

220 2018-03-07 22:05:38 Ban assult weapons,  bump stocks and hi capacity magazines.  If you do that the NRA won't be able to cause these vicious knife attacks. Turn out the kids to demand it. You could put them all in cute little brown shirts!

232 2018-03-07 22:02:41 Here's the thing: yes, they were. However, states also were required to keep stocks of arms, powder & shot because track record of gun ownership was iffy. Also, in the 19th century, militia musters lagged considerably. Most stopped, save for volunteer militia.
233 2018-03-07 22:02:34 This is true, I just think peoples expectations are somewhat unrealistic at times and people are impatient. If you invested in most stocks last year at this time you’d be a lot worse off.

248 2018-03-07 21:58:48 The top five stocks that fell today were $DLTR, $KR, $ROST, $BF.B and $AYI.
249 2018-03-07 21:58:45 Trump’s tariffs are said to lower the price of steel stocks. My question is will they get so low to where you get them for a steal?!
250 2018-03-07 21:58:09 The top five stocks that gained today were $ADSK, $HRB, $AMD, $FTV, and $DRH.

256 2018-03-07 21:56:21 #Dow (w/o #CNN notice--contradicted #agenda) 1st wet up strongly, as overall stocks even. Then came broader drop as #SellPrograms took #Dow down 320. No worries. #Stocks bounced back up, as #Nasdaq ended substantially UP, while S & P 500 ended about even.
257 2018-03-07 21:54:56 So you’re ready to ban bump stocks while talking about school safety. Why? We don’t know if the Vegas shooting, the only incident of bump stock related crimes, even used them or if he just had them. But banning things that replicate automatic fire? How do you define automatic?
258 2018-03-07 21:54:38 How come it was only you who sold stocks — seriously just you
259 2018-03-07 21:54:22 Opposition to protectionism rising. Chief WH Econ Advisor Gary Cohn resigns over proposed US steel tariffs... British Pound  weak against US dollar. Could signal positive things for British equities... Tariffs and rising dollar could signal near-term top in emerging mrkt stocks.

261 2018-03-07 21:53:41 More than 47,794 people have asked credit card companies to stop processing payments from retailers that sell assault weapons, bump stocks, and extended ammo clips. @BankofAmerica, will you do your part to help stop mass murders?
262 2018-03-07 21:53:08 Today, Stocks showed good gains in small caps and Nasdaq. This further reinforces Fusion view that Cohen was a needed relief pitcher only and tariffs are not that important in a post 08’ Fusion era. More worries by masses in a time correction are very LT bullish for stocks

268 2018-03-07 21:50:08 Another vital piece of info I got from David Ryan on the Marketsmith webinar available on YouTube is sell most of your winners at 20 to 25%. This rule we all know but he then goes on to say to William O'Neil that I expect all my stocks to be multibaggers. He then tells D. Ryan..
269 2018-03-07 21:49:32 Yes it's nice to see spurs get knocked out the champions league and it's all banter but we'll be the fucking laughing stocks if we carry on playing the way we are and then get knocked out the fucking Europa League. Let's just concentrate on ourselves..  #afc
270 2018-03-07 21:49:30 Enough of the ignorant comments. Why not offer reasonable solutions to gun violence, including enhanced background checks, eliminating bump stocks, and personal accountability. Personal attacks and nothing to the debate other than making the attacker look like a moron.
271 2018-03-07 21:49:13 Some U.S. bank stocks also fell as markets fretted over Mr. Cohn’s departure and its implications for trade, the economy and regulation. JPMorgan Chase & Co. closed down 0.4%, while Citigroup edged down 0.2%. WSJ
272 2018-03-07 21:48:15 Too many ppl long on these stocks quickly try to quell controversy related to such 'leaks'. They say 'no big deal', or 'happens all the time' out of fear public criticism will yield further erosion of share price. It's that 'sheep' response that lets these firms get away with it.
273 2018-03-07 21:48:11 All the main crypto dropped in price last night at 2 to 3am ( Australian eastern time) interesting the NASDAQ dropped heaps at the exact time . Did not realise we follow the stocks .

There is no logic in banning bump stocks when Paddock is the only mass shooter in history to have used the device. When states were passing concealed carry laws in the early 1990s, states that had the laws saw fewer violent crimes.

Fundamental questions: Will it be significant enough to catalyze retaliation? If so, what will Trump do? Market behavior depends on these.
351 2018-03-07 21:10:46 Washington State has just passed legislation to ban bump stocks. Didn't need any 'incentive' from you to do so. Just the right thing to do. They just passed legalization to impose net neutrality after you guys blew that up. Common sense not lobby money.

368 2018-03-07 21:06:32 "fish stocks" is what fish are in the sea. And no, there are not plenty more!
The fish in EU areas that UK fisherman currently have access to, greatly outnumber the number of fish that EEA countries have access to in what would become UK waters again. 
We lose more than we gain!
369 2018-03-07 21:06:26 CNBC  CNBC is responsible for Jim Cramer who causes the illegal pumping and dumping of stocks
370 2018-03-07 21:05:42 Stupid Trump. A lot of people who rely on their stocks & bonds are hurting because of this guy’s stupidity

372 2018-03-07 21:05:19 After all the hard work they put in building the fish stocks back up, you can hardly blame them.
373 2018-03-07 21:05:15 Stock Market closed slightly down following the resignation of Gary Cohen. Dow was down a little over 80 points, still up for the week following a strong Monday.

380 2018-03-07 21:03:28 Hey, no problem. Yeah I get that point. I guess I'm surprised with the OTT reaction to what is ostensibly a good thing, or at least an attempt to be good. Brewdog stocks seem to have lowered, compared to beer brands who did nothing. It breeds apathy for fear of backlash

413 2018-03-07 20:51:51 Gun laws should be stricter. For example, bump stocks should be illegal because they turn a firearm into an automatic weapon. But I believe that you cannot just make guns illegal. Maybe it's the way I grew up but that's just my opinion. People kill people, guns don't kill people.

499 2018-03-07 20:18:52 Individual stocks can be bought out. 
Indexes can’t.  

Good example:  Snapple
Ridiculously overpriced and got bought out 
by Quaker Oats at a ridiculous price.

501 2018-03-07 20:17:22 The European Union's securities watchdog said curbs on trading  shares in the "dark" or off public exchanges across the European Union  will be rolled out on March 12 and cover the bulk of blue-chip stocks  such as HSBC and Unilever.
502 2018-03-07 20:17:18 Time to buy stocks in napkins! I am guessing they are currently valuable and a hot commodity, because it does not matter what you order at a popular coffee drive thru, you are not getting one without begging the poor gal at the window!
One napkin...please. We will all share it!!
503 2018-03-07 20:16:28 I hope my investment stocks make me a ton of money ... shit
504 2018-03-07 20:15:31 The markets tend to move before the stories even develop and the facts are straight.

Forex & stocks ain't much better, however, it is more obvious.
505 2018-03-07 20:15:05 I see the normies are riled up about this Stocks narrative when the real fiasco is the Google Lens affair.
506 2018-03-07 20:14:51 In agreement with @Landm_Marius watch his latest video. He has had some great calls lately. This one is moving as planned, so I believe the Trend will run. Stocks down, money flow to crypto
507 2018-03-07 20:14:22 If you bought stocks in 2007 and held them til today you beat bonds, oil, gold, cash.  What’s your point?

518 2018-03-07 20:11:19 I saw elsewhere on the internet that it isn't insider trading cause it isn't stocks, but who knows if that was correct.
519 2018-03-07 20:10:21 Hopefully the Dow will drop even more. Sorry I don't feel sorry for the rich. Bc they are the only ones who can afford to have stocks. Middle-class income cannot have such a luxury
520 2018-03-07 20:09:45 They're just accidents waiting to happen there's better ways to secure schools 

And I don't think we should ban any more guns for gun control we need required training to buy a gun, ban of bump stocks, expand mental health checks, and a federal waiting period
521 2018-03-07 20:08:44 Representative Bill Beck just left the Civil Justice Subcommittee in protest of the decision to roll a bill that would regulate bump stocks in Tennessee.

Two survivors of the Las Vegas massacre are here to testify on the bill, but Chairman Mike Carter would not allow it.
522 2018-03-07 20:08:22 It appears that for tech stocks it is better that Gary Cohn resigned. Why didn't Trump fire this guy last year? At least our government would still be solvent.

527 2018-03-07 20:05:15 Steel and aluminum stocks rally after Gary Cohn resignation paves way for tariff announcement
528 2018-03-07 20:05:04 The rumor on which stocks rallied yesterday and the day before was that Gary Cohn is staying in the White House. I am sure today's rumor is just as true.
529 2018-03-07 20:04:33 Stocks are oblivious to the likelihood the Chinese will hit back hard regarding tariffs...

543 2018-03-07 19:56:56 finally they’re doing something about bump stocks
544 2018-03-07 19:56:55 Age restrictions, ban on bump stocks just for starters. Those things are easy and not a gun-grab. I own guns and support both those things.

549 2018-03-07 19:54:49 I thought part of the stocks negative pressure came from the long term CVOT requirement. Management didn’t try hard enuf to provide investors a picture of clarity. $ESPR
550 2018-03-07 19:54:41 Other brokerages, albeit charges fees for said actions, make the stock immediately available.

554 2018-03-07 19:53:30 I wouldn’t hope for anything as that is an emotion! But the way I see it I believe we see more upside to come. What with growth stocks already showing signs of life, the rest might play along.

558 2018-03-07 19:51:57 Then do what we the people want. Stricter gun laws, raise age to 21 and put in place the semiautomatic gun ban, ban mega magazines, ban bump stocks, close loopholes at gun sales.

573 2018-03-07 19:44:30 I guess that’s why my stocks are all down.
574 2018-03-07 19:44:29 C’mon you seem like a smart enough guy.  You have to be able to see the difference between stocks of actual companies that produce goods and services vs crypto speculation.
575 2018-03-07 19:43:43 It gets fuzzy, insider trading, as far as I know, only involves stocks. From what I’ve read it was assets in the physical businesses.
576 2018-03-07 19:43:39 I can't do anything: This market forces me into new positions! There are plenty of good looking, strong and outperforming #stocks out there. I know it can change in one day, but this is a clear statement from "Mr. Market".
577 2018-03-07 19:43:23 Here is the NRA - opposing *any* change at all - except for one that leads to more gun sales.

And now they are even against banning bump stocks? This is a fringe organization at this point.
578 2018-03-07 19:43:20 Papa Johns is a publically held enteity. Doesn’t master if you have “stock” or the principle owner of a franchise. If your sell your “ownership” off non public info, isn’t that the definition of “insider info” stocks or not?
579 2018-03-07 19:43:03 that is sadly true. 40 Euro for a lotion is quite much. Sadly their regular soaps don't work for me - they make my skin painfully dry.But I like their shower gel (I have always got stocks of their "Snow Fairy" from the Christmas LE at home)

605 2018-03-07 19:34:07 It's a rifle designed specifically for infantrymen to carry more ammo into battle and be less fatigued after shooting hundreds of rounds,  and it's popularity has also made it excessively easy to illegally modify (bump stocks) to a banned weapon.

627 2018-03-07 19:24:22 Arms refers to more than just guns.  It's a general term for all weapons,  and yet other types have limitations.  Guns seem to be the only ones people complain about,  so,  if I can't legally own a gravity knife,  they can ban bump stocks. Sorry dude.
628 2018-03-07 19:24:15 Some truth though, Chuck ran to the TV after Vegas, and said they want to ban bump stocks, they are still out of stock nearly everywhere everywere. I get emails notifying me from web gun shops when they are back in stock, go the site in an hour they are gone again.

630 2018-03-07 19:23:21 Here are European Banks relative to European equities. The way I see it, if we're above the 2015 high, it's really hard for me to be bearish european stocks, and therefore stocks as an asset class

635 2018-03-07 19:19:06 The right to life is inalienable. The right to own an AR-15 or bump stocks, or to buy *any* gun if you have a violent history, are mentally unsound or too young for good judgement, not so.
636 2018-03-07 19:18:45 You mean like Trump signing that ban on bump stocks he promised? (ans said he could do it by executive order?)

What does it take for the Left to wake up and realize that President Trump didn’t become a multi-billionaire by making bad business decisions? If he says we need some tariffs, then we need them!!!

657 2018-03-07 19:12:33 Reason is, If you think market is costly, nifty was 27 p/e at 6k in 2008, it was 27 p/e few days ago at 11k & who knows in 2028 27 p/e will be at 23k. In between this many good stocks gone up 6x-10x. Most preferred, usual buys also went 3x-4x. So why wait? Buy & keep buying!

660 2018-03-07 19:09:49 Lol ... not wanting to comment negatively on anyone. My portfolio as a PMS manager has done much better than most small and micro cap managers. Growth story is in the fundamentals and not picking up penny stocks like “catch them young and see them grow”

664 2018-03-07 19:05:53 At midday, Mortgage Bonds flat to slightly higher. Stocks considerably lower. 10-yr yield 2.86%.
665 2018-03-07 19:05:29 I can easily see the markets rallying again by tomorrow. The "stocks will never go down!" fixation seems... well, fixed.

At least until something really, unquestionably bursts the bubble.
666 2018-03-07 19:05:07 I think I’m reaching my middle-age early because I’m actively considering investing in stocks  What have I become?
667 2018-03-07 19:04:56 Means as soon as possible. If you can't find stocks, buy good multicap preferably PPFAS or Quantum or Franklin Prima Plus or Templeton India Equity if want active churning of portfolio or else invest in nifty and nifty next 50 etf with 25% of your funds to stay invested.
668 2018-03-07 19:04:19 Far more likely he's doing it 1) Cuz he really lives in delusional reality where it's "smart" or 2) Cuz he loves conflict or 3) Cuz Putin told him to (anger our allies, harm economy) or 4) he & buddies will secretly buy up steel stocks low & then announce no tariffs after all
669 2018-03-07 19:03:30 These replies make me laugh. Everyone supports science, research, statistics, and evidence until it goes contrary to their "omniscient" opinion. Just like the 110% Trump supporters until he hints at a compromise on bump stocks. Then he's Satan personified.

672 2018-03-07 19:02:55 It's certainly a problem for trading stocks.  But is it a problem on private sales?
673 2018-03-07 19:02:48 @ezraklein I'm not an expert of stocks, but is there any chance Trump did tariffs & got rid of Cohen to make market drop so that companies can buy their stocks back at lower prices?
674 2018-03-07 19:02:44 More guns in the hands of Citizens begets less mass killings. Especially if the weapons are assault type with modifications to convert them to automatic fire ,like Bump Stocks with 30 to 100 round magazines, bought at private sales without background checks. Is that right NRA?

679 2018-03-07 19:00:18 No one opposes all gun control laws.
Gun owners are not pushing to make machine guns available. Defense of bump stocks was half hearted at best.
But semi-autos are now most of the guns out there and that is a real line in the sane.

689 2018-03-07 18:57:20 Due to the CFP, the French, Spanish, Dutch, Danes and others have plundered UK fish stocks in UK Territorial Waters since 1973. Why should they have continued access to our Waters once we leave the EU? We should export fish to these countries, not import our own fish from them.
690 2018-03-07 18:57:20 They probably don 't care... there arrogance and lies are bigger then the fish stocks world wide.
691 2018-03-07 18:57:14 and one day (maybe before to is to late) most investors will see it before their ignorance, naiveness or denials destroy them in their never ending bid of stocks and dip buying. Hello, ytd data is rather bad, q1 GDP est 1.7-2.1 and EU & Asia in synch selling since January

693 2018-03-07 18:56:59 For 'council homes' read 'affordable homes'. Pressure on affordable homes on 2 fronts leads to crisis: 
1. fewer council/affordable homes because stocks not replenished
2. higher/unaffordable rents because 40% of sector owned by private landlords, which skews total rental market

708 2018-03-07 18:50:50 It is government policy for stocks to go up. In Japan, China, Europe, and the US. So they go up irregardless of fundamentals, because central banks are buying them with printed money, either overtly (Japan), or covertly (US). That's the whole story. Nothing else matters.

722 2018-03-07 18:47:24 Selling off private assets isn't selling stock (a la insider trading). Franchises aren't stocks. Even if he did sell off stocks of Papa John's he would be considered an insider in the company since he owned franchises, so it'd be legal.

749 2018-03-07 18:33:36 It wasn’t meant to be. A friend at work lost over $200K in BTC and alts recently. Obviously stocks are risky also.

752 2018-03-07 18:32:46 Think of it like leverage for stocks: brokered deposits are linked to higher risk because they increase the deposit base at a higher cost of funds.  But per Section 202, 2(e) Reciprocal deposits are explicitly prohibited from increasing the deposit base so no added risk possible.

791 2018-03-07 18:19:57 I wondered that, too, but I think insider trading only happens with stocks? Colorado law on fraud talks about advertising to "the public or to a substantial segment thereof."

886 2018-03-07 17:40:33 @OutnumberedFNC Gary Cohen resignation over the steel and aluminum tariff/taxes I think he's mad because that affects his foreign steel stocks So there's going to be less profit for him and his friends
887 2018-03-07 17:39:39 The top five stocks lower at noon today are $DLTR, $DISCK ( $DISCA ), $IP, $ROST, and $BF.B
888 2018-03-07 17:39:30 Ban assault rifles bump stocks and high capacity magazines for @repdavetrott #AR15 #NotOneMore #GunControl
889 2018-03-07 17:39:08 Why are all of the major steel users stocks down ? The toe sucker is not an economist .
890 2018-03-07 17:38:34 The top five stocks higher at noon today are $ADSK, $HRB, $AMD, $DHR, $FTV.
891 2018-03-07 17:38:31 How did Carl Icahn know  what metal stocks to dump a week B4 #Trump announced high tariffs on Steel & Aluminum? Something is rotten in the White House!
892 2018-03-07 17:37:52 What a bad opinion. In wealth management, I have clients who have hundreds of millions and carefully decide which stocks to sell based on seemingly inconsequential tax hits... money matters to everyone.
893 2018-03-07 17:37:50 The top five most active stocks at noon today are $AMD, $MU, $GE, $BAC, and $INTC.
894 2018-03-07 17:37:38 We are under the downtrend line again. Good news: There are a high odds to make a double bottom near 1D BB(around 9400), the bad news is H&S mentioned earlier #bitcoin $btc $ltc #litecoin $eth #ethereum $xrp $stocks $crypto $usdt $cme $bch $BCash $tether $neo $xrp
895 2018-03-07 17:37:02 Could be that Cohn knows of the insider trading tied to Donthecons one  time Advisor Carl Icahn 31 million dollar dump of steel stocks ahead of Captain Asshats tariff announcement. That’s not suspicious at all.
896 2018-03-07 17:35:44 Stocks really piss me off 
897 2018-03-07 17:35:42 Some good news for you. @MarketSmith   is FREE this week. You can learn how to use it. I've made videos on how to use it. Was in Beta test group for original product.  Make more $$$$. @IBDinvestors #stocks
898 2018-03-07 17:35:16 Honest question.... do you own any other stocks anymore besides FAT? You are 100 % all day everyday about FAT? Whatever happened to MMJ, DDB, PKG, CANN...... you get the point... just curious?
899 2018-03-07 17:34:44 Do want to say though that we need a longer term solution to imbalanced trade.  Because the way it is being balanced now is through China et. al. buying our assets (stocks and bonds).  If there's nothing they can do with those assets, really, then that's currency manipulation.

906 2018-03-07 17:33:43 What else would we expect him to say - I dumped shares with knowledge of TARIFFS on steel being discussed or just got lucky? 
The #shortinterest on #steel #stocks might be an interesting to look at as well...
907 2018-03-07 17:33:20 Oil and stocks have been highly correlated lately. Still makes no sense for Oil to plunge here, usually uncertainty will drive the price higher. Especially when it involves one of the world biggest producers talking tariffs. Guess we will find out Thursday what the markets thinks
908 2018-03-07 17:33:18 People never look deeper than what is portrayed on the media Martin is a very smart business man but I think he is having legal issues with his stocks he has or somthing
909 2018-03-07 17:33:06 Thank you @CSE_News
910 2018-03-07 17:31:48 @WarriorTrading1 would knowing a stocks profile of many times its gapped up and the frequency of long or short bias succeeding the gap help make better decisions with Gap and Go strategy? Is that possible to build?
911 2018-03-07 17:31:08 Marketing strategy, and to bring n the hype, they knew any way they'll sell the whole stocks for sure
912 2018-03-07 17:30:53 Therefore, for the stocks that survived those halcyon days, recovery is now within sight. Buy and hold anyone?
913 2018-03-07 17:30:40 dude randy you suck.. man you had a 18000 upside target which u called 2 days ago.. now you are pulling your 2013 chart back out of your backside, telling people to invest in stocks when dow is going down this year  - this is a manipulated sell of - wait for the buy wall - i call
914 2018-03-07 17:30:39 No military uses semiautomatic AR-15's. No military uses bump stocks. Ar-15's are not significantly different than other firearms.
915 2018-03-07 17:29:53 All of you are skirting the FACT that gun deaths, by mass slaughter of innocents,are increasing. Each one is a human life. I continue to appose ANY semi-automatic, automatic, weapon in the hands of the public. Bump stocks as well. They are weapons of murder.
916 2018-03-07 17:29:13 Everything is down. Stocks, Gold, Silver, Oil.  Money is moving out and being held on the sidelines.
917 2018-03-07 17:29:11 ...Because it's unconscionable that, that in this day & age, when a mentally ill teenager can wipe out a school with the assault rifle he bought that morning, anyone should have to wait 3 whole days to acquire a gun. And because bump stocks are so vital to home defense! #fail
918 2018-03-07 17:29:09 IMHO about 5% of all crypto currencies will survive. Still ahead of stocks but not for the faint of hear. An eye on commodities brother
919 2018-03-07 17:28:55 $INPX - one of the few stocks under $5 w nice action today. Looking good. Want that breakout over 1.57.
920 2018-03-07 17:28:25 Give us a break, Mr. Magoo. 

How dare YOU endanger our law enforcement officers by allowing teens, the mentally ill, and members of the terrorist watch list to purchase assault rifles. 

With bump stocks. 

Absent any universal background checks.
921 2018-03-07 17:28:21 Nah nigs really invested in imaginary money like real stocks don't exist LOL
922 2018-03-07 17:28:05 Every fish we eat in volume in the UK comes from stocks that spawn locally but mature in colder waters. If we set trawlers into British waters without co-ordinating, we’ll pick up the babies before they can impregnate and thus create other fish.

That’s pretty much all you need.
923 2018-03-07 17:27:39 Big difference between selling assets and selling stocks.  Manning sold his assets and therefore inside trading has nothing to do with it.  Nothing wrong with selling assets based on known information.  You are allowed to sell your house if you know the market will crash

927 2018-03-07 17:26:43 The 12.00PM reversal is not chart related.  
It is becoming endemic to the market on a daily basis. $CRON $9.75 reversal exactly on the stroke of Noon.  Only one of many stocks.  Tell me that is not computer manipulation.  Disgusting!
928 2018-03-07 17:26:17 Wrong. If the law would be 21 to buy a gun legally, Cruz would not have been able to buy a gun. If bump stocks were illegal to manufacture and sale, Paddock would not have been able to kill as many as fast as he did. Facts. Not opinions.
929 2018-03-07 17:25:32 It’s not insider trading, he sold a company not stocks.....
930 2018-03-07 17:24:34 Background checks using computers is the biggest 1 and 2.  After that I’d look at adding domestic abusers to the list (with a court remedy for removal).  

Then I’d look at certain kinds of arms and accessories: bump stocks, expanded magazines, “assault rifles.”
931 2018-03-07 17:24:32 @maddow Carl Icahn has sold more then $30 mil. steel stocks and @Scaramucci still taking the marching order from @realDonaldTrump
932 2018-03-07 17:24:05 NRA will put up their traditional straw man arguments - anything to divert from unregulated gun shows & the tactical gear industry. No legitimate need for silencers, bump-stocks, giant drum magazines, it even (dare I say) AR-15s. PS: "wild hog hunters in TX" argument is utter BS

936 2018-03-07 17:22:35 babuaa, stocks kahaan hain???
937 2018-03-07 17:22:27 Add to that if you have more than one target, you are going to need more than 2 bullets. I'm all for background checks, no guns for mental health issues, and no bump stocks. 11 bullets in a magazine should be plenty. Changing one really doesn't take much time.
938 2018-03-07 17:22:22 On second thought. I wasn't watching, but just saw that drop. Still not sure what is the driving what. Could still be oil caused the plunge, not the other way around. Not so sure it's about fear, Gold usually goes much higher when there is fear. Stocks selling off for a month now

941 2018-03-07 17:21:32 Carl Icahn dumps his steel stocks right before Trump announces steel tariffs. Peyton Manning dumps his Papa John stocks right before the NFL & Papa John's part ways. Hello, SEC? Are you there? Or did Trump put Ivanka's 19 year-old assistant hairdresser in charge of that agency?
942 2018-03-07 17:21:06 Yes, excellent call that was. BTC is exponentially risky over stocks, when people get afraid they sell greatest risk first.
943 2018-03-07 17:20:50 I’d disagree on high quality. Cohn did F Over the middle class with the tax bill. Good riddance. I won’t be making any investment in stocks either.
944 2018-03-07 17:20:48 Given all of the headlines the last 24 hrs the #stockmarket was holding up fine.  #bitcoin drops around 11:15 precipitously and stocks follow.  Very interesting.
945 2018-03-07 17:20:35 I know it was rhetorical. I'll take any chance I get to slam the corrupt nature of the U.S. economic/financial system. It's become blatant.  I would urge you to start looking at small developmental mining stocks. Insiders have been aggressively buying shares for about two years.

949 2018-03-07 17:19:43 Stocks and Crypto taking a huge dump today... Save us someone.
950 2018-03-07 17:19:24 But that wasn’t a 'loss' was it? Our oil stocks were deliberately sold for loot, and at a loss too. But they put up the price of petrol and a levy too, just for more loot and to fund their election campaign
951 2018-03-07 17:19:23 Re arranged sum stocks in my retirement fund, it's a ways away but ima just let thatsit and flip in that account. put a down payment on a house ina few years
952 2018-03-07 17:19:15 Market place but instead of edible stocks, we have women that are put on display for entertainment. 
953 2018-03-07 17:19:12 So when you see something becoming a large portion of your portfolio you should not throw all your money into it, but rather evaluate your expectation about this stock future growth and give it a larger portion of your portfolio only if it is better than all the other stocks.
954 2018-03-07 17:18:04 Norway is far less environmentally virtuous than their reputation claims. Their fjords are full of plastic, they have pollution- and disease-ridden fish farms all over the world (check Marine Harvest) that threaten wild native fish stocks. Not good.
955 2018-03-07 17:17:55 Though I don't invest in stocks but used to watch cnbc awaz since you brought wit and humor to other wise routine and mundane mkt analysis. Would be good to share your future plans with your innumerable followers. Wish you the best in your future endeavors @anilsinghviCNBC
956 2018-03-07 17:17:54 Unfortunately our stocks getting low and are not due to be replenished before Sat and our chief in-house Brownie maker is away at a family funeral so we aren’t able to help this time. Good luck though and happy birthday!

961 2018-03-07 17:16:14 The legislature we elected is playing this according to their tried and true game plan.
They're gonna offer condolence and feign concern and speak about background checks and bump stocks, some even say "ban the AR-15"
BUT THEY'RE NOT DOING IT

Unless we make them do it
962 2018-03-07 17:15:50 If I was a headline writer, today's low hanging fruit would be:

964 2018-03-07 17:14:26 I believe you and everything but sometimes your tweets make you sound like you got a few billion sitting around. Dropping around 100k every other week is just mind blowing to me. Why even buy stocks when you already have everything.
965 2018-03-07 17:14:01 Last week Jan Angel voted against a ban on bump stocks. #Flipthe26th
966 2018-03-07 17:13:48 Sure they don't but they do also have spare stocks also in case of emergencies if you don't know.

Why would anyone want 2 live in such a country R vote for U?  "Not Me."
968 2018-03-07 17:13:26 My suggestion: Go trough the list of top losing #stocks everyday! Then you know why risk management and stops are important in #trading.
969 2018-03-07 17:12:28 Thanks for standing up against Ted Cruz. We know what works to reduce gun violence! It's been demonstrated by other countries; Ban under 21, End immunity for firearms companies, Ban Bump Stocks, Ban and Buy-Back Assault style weapons. Background Checks, no loopholes &SafetyTraing

971 2018-03-07 17:12:18 Wooow it's like you forgot about that T Rex that came and saved those people's lives. And teamed up with the raptors to take down the GMO dinosaur! Genetic modification is clearly the problem here, dinosaur bump stocks need to be regulated.
972 2018-03-07 17:12:08 You need to look for it in retailers while stocks last. It gets released this month!
973 2018-03-07 17:11:57 Scaramucci "stocks overracting to shock of tariffs"...couldn't agree more.
974 2018-03-07 17:11:30 Did you know Gary Cohen because he left GS & went to work for gov he pays NO CAPITAL GAINS ON HIS 7.5 mil gain on his stocks from them UNREAL this is standard for people who do this I want that gig
975 2018-03-07 17:11:02 Cómo sabes que lo a cortos hacen fuerza? Hay muchísimas posiciones cortas que nunca a acaban en mercados regulados. Además esta subiendo con total normalidad, hay mucha leyenda urbana acerca de los cortos..

1071 2018-03-07 16:57:15 Why? Asking wallstreet to put a curb on foolish behavior by politicians by picking stocks is not only bad capitalism, it's atrocious democracy. It's high time the media stopped telling just so stories linking noise in stock market data to political moves.

1081 2018-03-07 16:50:59 If this isn't the time you are working overtime to find stocks that you can comfortably hold for over a year even if some further more draw down comes, then you won't survive long in the markets in the long run!

1145 2018-03-07 16:29:48 I hear that more than I believe it. Most value stocks are at least a little junky. If a bargain remains a bargain it isn't a bargain. For a stock to rise to fair value requires momentum or for fair value to fall. Value and MoMo are two sides of the same coin.
1146 2018-03-07 16:29:42 Besides that, bump stocks have never been used in crime. The media reported that they were found in the hotel room in Vegas, but there is no proof that they were used. The whole Vegas tragedy a big cover up, so he more than likely had an actual machine gun, which is illegal.

1193 2018-03-07 16:15:42 We’ll agree to disagree on this issue. Trump had an immigration compromise bill in front of him that he supported then didn’t. He supported universal background checks and banning bump stocks, until the NRA took him to dinner. Trump supports Dem proposals until GOP pushes back.

1195 2018-03-07 16:15:25 Platforms are all very well, but stocks win or die based on the lead compound. Never buy a stock because you like the *second* drug in their pipeline. And there are remarkably few true platform companies with proven platforms.

1284 2018-03-07 15:49:31 ADSK up over $12 nice move #stocks
1285 2018-03-07 15:49:18 Stocks are dropping at a rapid rate. This isn't one of your casinos. You obviously have no clue what you're doing.
1286 2018-03-07 15:49:03 Modern day industrial trawling has depleted stocks all over the world. UK used to have thousands of sail/rowing fishing boats all around the coast. Greed took over. Fishing industry started to collapse in early 70's, just as we joined with Europe, now EU, wouldn't you know it.
1287 2018-03-07 15:47:59 I agree we need stronger gun control but this shouldn't be the focus 
We need required training, waiting periods, expanded background checks, mental health, more attachment bans (like bump stocks and high capacity mags)

On a federal level

1294 2018-03-07 15:45:01 Trump rally boys and girls like to see Cohn gone, because they do not own stocks or bonds and don’t believe in Social Security. Wonder what they plan for their retirement? Trump will share his billions? Mean time the world shudders as Trump is ruling by whim

1298 2018-03-07 15:43:30 Why are stocks shaking off inevitability of #TradeWars and who is buying? Oh, IDK maybe $800 BILLION in #StockBuybacks and global CBs with printing press might have something to do with it?

1303 2018-03-07 15:41:50 Yea this should continue throughout week a steady climb
1304 2018-03-07 15:41:43 And what are you doing about guns? You said you were going to raise the age to 21...you said you were going to ban bump stocks...now what about making AR-15's illegal? Quit trying to move on from this issue. Solve this issue first.

1319 2018-03-07 15:37:22 many have questioned my sanity on twitter, for good reason.  but, as you know, stocks often move for reasons that are not tied to fundamentals.  with the shorts piling on we could see this stock easily double

1329 2018-03-07 15:36:18 no clue.. stocks are stocks so likely production exports or imports were off.  but stocks are generally the most correct so have to say the error is elsewhere.

1390 2018-03-07 15:18:31 New Hampshire Legislators take a “wait and see” approach on bump stocks and a “NO” on raising the age from 18 to 21 on purchasing long guns. So much for Forward Thinking New Hampshire 
1391 2018-03-07 15:18:30 I wonder how many lay-people consider bump stocks to be just a different way to make a gun full-auto, due to the final effect, regardless of the technical modification made.

1398 2018-03-07 15:16:45 My impression is that there aren't that many people converting semi-autos. It's often not a trivial process, esp when the base gun is designed well. That's part reason bump stocks are popular (besides legal vs illegal)

1406 2018-03-07 15:14:54 No one is saying the laws would be ex post facto. If they pass law declaring bump stocks illegal it would then be illegal to possess them. I suppose you could just keep them in your home and never use them but it would still be illegal

1413 2018-03-07 15:13:24 $CDIX plenty of catalysts coming guys you should be buying just to name a few:

1426 2018-03-07 15:09:25 Me normally not either, I would fish stocks because it is cumbersome to make one yourself. For beef you need onions, garlic, mixed herbs, funny enough some cinnamon,  and fry it sharp, maybe a bit of balsamic vinegar or red wine, tomatoes or carrots. You should have flavour!
1427 2018-03-07 15:09:06 @businessinsider @business stocks down in box stores like Dollar General, DollarTree, Cisco ect is due more to Americans having enough money not to HAVE to shop in welfare/discount stores than anything else..
1428 2018-03-07 15:08:38 Pumping tunes, and stepping away from the market for a bit, nothing is really getting me excited. $weed puts is about the only thing I would do. Any other recommendations, what are ppl watching? I don't care about 2bit penny stocks.

1451 2018-03-07 15:02:51 We get allocated just 30% of stock quotas for our own waters the rest is given away to other EU states,,, And an insight into trading, Norway (none EU Member) can ship white fish stocks to the EU and they are Tax /quota free.. If there is a demand for British fish EU profit drops
1452 2018-03-07 15:02:39 Well at this rate we won’t have any fish to sell. The Foreign trawlers will diminish our fish stocks which isn’t fair for an independent British trawler who provides fresh fish for the fish mongers. It’s a vicious cycle.

1497 2018-03-07 14:51:30 It is never a good idea to load up your retirement account with high yield stocks - not then, not now. Too bad for those who lost money, but it was poor investing strategy to begin with. Best approach is balanced, diversified portfolio of dividend & non dividend stocks

1505 2018-03-07 14:49:47 As per Reynolds "This tells us that the underlying demand for credit remains strong and that once stocks recover from the current correction, there will be even more money for buybacks and M&A." Spot on...@dwyerstrategy
1506 2018-03-07 14:49:46 CAPE for China is 16, price to book is over 2, forward earnings is 14. Given moderate interest rates and potential for growth, Chinese stocks seem like a great buy, especially in comparison to the USA. GMO also thinks so and they're not Pollyannas.
1507 2018-03-07 14:49:17 And you think the EU want WTO, maybe they should consult Ireland in this matter... and it will be the EU that is looking for alternative fish stocks not us as for some reason our waters seem slightly more desirable to the Dutch that their own and The Dutch sell to anyone,,

1527 2018-03-07 14:45:36 It amuses me when I read people avoiding a stock simply because it has a "high" PE ratio. Many of the biggest winning stocks in history had what appeared to be an unreasonably high PE before they experienced their largest advance.

1538 2018-03-07 14:43:39 spoos might be rallying..

i'm busy shorting a few stocks this mornin
1539 2018-03-07 14:43:19 Awwww that’s cute you own stocks & want to show off all the material things you can buy.........
1540 2018-03-07 14:43:02 This is a classic example why I don't put a lot of faith in after hours actions. $AMZN was down over 20 points after the close. #stocks
1541 2018-03-07 14:42:36 JefCo: We analyzed the effects of the 2002/2003 tariffs and find that the shares of machinery stocks initially traded off ~10%, but then outperformed the SPX by ~40%; however, it was also a period of early cyclical recovery.
1542 2018-03-07 14:42:35 Because bump stocks do not change the firing mechanics of a gun. It still only fires one bullet per trigger pull.
1543 2018-03-07 14:42:32 That’s how the market works,time to buy stocks like Twitter because they truly shouldn’t be effected by this.I like twitters stock but am not endorsing it ,it’s a hard stock to own
1544 2018-03-07 14:42:23 As expected, Stocks plunge at the open but have cut losses since the opening bell at 9:30 a.m. ET.
1545 2018-03-07 14:42:13 UPDATE: Consumer stocks tumble at open, Dollar Tree down 15 percent, Ross Stores slides 6.6 percent, Best Buy down 2.7 percent $DLTR $ROST $BBY
1546 2018-03-07 14:41:49 Market just open. Getting hammered. ALL the stocks we follow are down except one: Annaly Capital Management (NLY: $10.30). Love this company. Why? It pays 11.8%. WHAT? Yup, that's right. It's been doing that for 20 years. Worth $12 billion. Worried about stocks? Move into Annaly.

1566 2018-03-07 14:36:33 You gotta wonder why the Gun "Enthusiasts" and the NRA want AR-15's, Bump Stocks and High Capacity Clips available to Non Military. Do they think we're going to be invaded by Aliens or face a Zombie Apocalypse? 
Or perhaps Russia........
1567 2018-03-07 14:36:33 $UQM 1.50 is key break point imo
1568 2018-03-07 14:36:15 Funny how we say it is "bump stocks" that kill people and not the guns or bullets.
When someone drinks/drives and kills someone do you blame easy to open bottle caps or the alcohol?
1569 2018-03-07 14:35:24 Stocks will be up hundreds of points by the end of the day...

1573 2018-03-07 14:34:46 Sell stocks …
1574 2018-03-07 14:34:06 The stock market started down nearly 300 points seconds after opening. Normally you would worry but this... But THIS market maybe be back up later. It is just as chaotic as the Administration that brings it to you.

1578 2018-03-07 14:33:43 For a minute, all but about 7 stocks on the S&P were red.
1579 2018-03-07 14:33:42 3. Currently they are not stocking goods just afew goods left on the shelves.

1580 2018-03-07 14:33:41 Of course, that is one particular chamber. An AR15 equipped with the 5.56 chamber is the same except for the burst function. And of course, while banning bump stocks seems reasonable, its not difficult to turn these weapons into full auto rifles.
1581 2018-03-07 14:32:55 Thank you sellers for the great discount on stocks this morning.
1582 2018-03-07 14:32:51 Red herring of a story. What is the value of the fishing industry to our economy?

1586 2018-03-07 14:31:42 Most Canadian companies are not capital rich enough to finance most of these enormously expensive projects. However, a lot of these " foreign " companies stocks are held by Canadian pension funds and they do hire Canadian workers largely.

1588 2018-03-07 14:30:47 A mutual fund is a collective investment that pools together the money of a large number of investors to purchase a variety of securities, like stocks or bonds.


1589 2018-03-07 14:30:35 And being ‘told what to do’ is different from mutually agreeing rules with your neighbours to sustain fish stocks and ensure free landing of fish.
1590 2018-03-07 14:30:06 @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @GOPLeader @JohnCornyn vast majority of Americans support NICS fix, banning bump stocks and banning AR15s. But you do nothing, letting more people die. Voters, especially young ones, are watching.
1591 2018-03-07 14:29:16 Little drama in Europe after markets in Asia sell off following Cohn departure. Feels like US #stocks could promptly shake off what's poised to be a rough open.

1606 2018-03-07 14:22:14 A second attempt to justify my complacence: valuations of China stocks are attractive, especially given China's potential for growth. Worries about debt may have already been priced in.

1608 2018-03-07 14:22:08 So why are stocks collapsing If Cohn leaves I mean you put support Trump's ideas.

Fox never says anything bad about trumps ideas
1609 2018-03-07 14:21:33 1)ServeTrump at your own risk.Being a top aide in his administration doesn’t usually work out well.
Some former advisers,like MichaelFlynn, are in legal trouble. Others, like SeanSpicer&Scaramucci, became laughing stocks. Still others have tarnished once-sterling reputations.

1625 2018-03-07 14:13:56 Our fishing fleets were systematically destroyed when we joined the EU. Since then fishing methods endorsed by the EU are decimating our fish stocks.

It's definitely my biggest frustration when it comes to dividend stocks. Most people don't look past the upfront yield. They don't see how a trickle of income today can become a raging river of cash flow.

1671 2018-03-07 13:53:55 Metal and mining stocks tumbled on worries over import tariffs announced  on steel and aluminum in US last weekend. Hindustan Copper (down  6.38%), Steel Authority of India (down 2.71%), Tata Steel (down 1.89%),  Vedanta (down 1.65%), JSW Steel (down 1.38%),

1673 2018-03-07 13:53:29 CHAOS NOT GOOD BUT:

1674 2018-03-07 13:53:19 Stocks were also boosted by reduced geopolitical concerns after North Korea told South Korea that it's willing to give up its nuclear weapons if the safety of the North Korean regime was guaranteed.

1699 2018-03-07 13:44:21 You are doing a great job! Love you on Fox business. Wish I invested in stocks more. Thank you!
1700 2018-03-07 13:44:16 Selling puts are not WMD’s. Selling puts on stocks you want to own, allow you to buy those stocks at a discount. You actually get paid to buy stocks you want to buy. Less risk than buying the stocks outright at mkt price.
1701 2018-03-07 13:43:48 Yes, Cohn’s resignation is not a good sign for all the reasons everyone has already mentioned.  However, tax rates are lower, regulations have been rolled back, and we’re still unlikely to have a full blown trade war.  Stocks are cheaper this morning than yesterday. #stillabuy
1702 2018-03-07 13:43:46 Ok cool - I'm into smaller stocks - in fact very small stocks, micro caps, as they have more potential to move faster, share price wise. I'm talking sub £20m mcaps.

1812 2018-03-07 12:47:07 All I know is that he started working there and the stocks went up. I'd encourage them to keep doing what they're doing :D
1813 2018-03-07 12:45:35 Investors selling stocks on Cohn's resignation are retarded. Congress makes fiscal policy. The Fed makes monetary policy and the president and his advisers make foreign policy. THAT'S what counts. Cohn is nobody. He was there because of ego and to craft some policy for bankers.
1814 2018-03-07 12:44:16 Mi Homes in Chennai don't know anything about when they'll receive the order, how many will they receive, nothing...

1819 2018-03-07 12:40:56 The only reason why I think it may negatively effect the crypto market is, people tend to start keeping cash on hand vs investments. It isn’t until people have faith in economy that they invest in assets(second house, stocks, crypto.)

1846 2018-03-07 12:27:08 There is far more democratic mercantilism about than any kind of capitalism. I saw this when I worked on the Street some years back and the dominance of bonds over stocks has grown greater since. Even in stocks, dividends have nearly entirely given way to speculative stock price.

1929 2018-03-07 11:43:43 Anyone selling their stocks because some fuck that never had power over Trump's decisions quit, is an idiot. 

The panic is unnecessary rn.

Panic when Mueller announces that Kushner, Donald Jr., or Ivanka are indicted. If it isn't Trump's family, is business as "usual" 4 @POTUS.

1931 2018-03-07 11:42:00 This does not impact the chart, fed prints, everything goes up, commodities as well as stocks, the ratio remains a screaming buy.

1974 2018-03-07 11:14:51 @StocksToTrade I have a question, do we have a STT option to put an alarm on the filters?
I set the 52 week high filter to be equal to or less than the last day's price, and place alerts on all stocks that cross the limit 52 week high for 1% or $0.10 
Is this already possible?
1975 2018-03-07 11:12:46 Cohn was shock to market. However, Donald won't enact trade tariffs as feared if at all. He's proved he will flip flop on policy on reaction from media. Feels no shame in doing so. Will go through in some weakened form or will just be left at wayside. Buy stocks on weakness.
1976 2018-03-07 11:10:49 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday

1992 2018-03-07 10:56:23 The reason it swings bearish in my mind is FA also. Way too much hope in the market still. No new money just whatever people have in alts and cash. Macro economy. Stocks bonds are getting rekt, a recession would lower confidence in crypto for the average investor.
1993 2018-03-07 10:55:14 Its simple. They just converted all the money sent out of india through Hawala and brought it back in this route. No wonder we saw a sudden spurt of Jewellery shops across india including tier 2 and 3 cities. Wonder how they can sustain such high stocks and low sales
1994 2018-03-07 10:52:57 It's only insider trading if you act on the information. Simply knowing something isn't a crime. 

If I know a steel tariff is about to be proposed a few days before it is made public but I don't sell off my steel related stocks until after it's announced - no problem.

European stocks -0.5% at the open, US stock futures -1% after Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn quits over tariffs. He was seen as an increasingly lone voice in the White House against protectionist measures.

Early deals coming in, but we're seeing sentiment for European stocks should be on the lower end when the cash equity market opens later.

2409 2018-03-07 06:17:24 Some of the sarkari bank stocks have almost halved from the highs they saw on ReCap news in October-November. 
Personally I avoid going bargain hunting in stuff that behaves like this technically.
2410 2018-03-07 06:17:18 Not all stocks fall in a bear market. Quality still exists and dividends are still payed out. It's not all doom and gloom in a bear market. U just need to think smarter.

2417 2018-03-07 06:10:35 It is commonly assumed that these institutions need to exist.  Do they?  With a mortgage market that was not concentrated, rates might be different in one place or another.  With no stock market, you might have to go shopping for stocks.  Would that hurt anything?  No.

2461 2018-03-07 05:43:32 It's a correction in a bull market. Can get deeper sometimes. Should get better levels to invest. PSU banks have lost their way. Quite bottomless. Still maintaining outperformance call on local metals stocks.
2462 2018-03-07 05:41:38 @nbc The Seth Meyers show is absolutely terrible. It should just be called the @realDonaldTrump show. It’s not even funny. Go take your political views somewhere else. I don’t even like politics. FYI my stocks are killing it.

2470 2018-03-07 05:37:07 I feel Another 10% correction in cash stocks(on my radar*) prices will bring most stocks to around good support/accumulation levels. Then one can start picking up small qty slowly for long term investment.

2471 2018-03-07 05:37:02 I'm pro #2A #NRA w/ccw permit. I rabidly reject any attempt at new gun bans but I fully support banning bump stocks. It's consistent w/ban on full-autos. That said - any serious impact on gun crime starts w/fixing NICS.

2481 2018-03-07 05:25:55 OH btw the president also wants to ban bump stocks, boy that puts you in a sticky situation huh. 
2482 2018-03-07 05:25:34 @DavidAFrench Do you honestly think that the 2nd amendment anticipated bump stocks and AR-15's? The only tyrants worth fighting are those who ascribe to that delusion.
2483 2018-03-07 05:25:30 As a life long Floridian, I urge you not to support gun control including raising the age to 21, banning bump stocks or increasing the wait time for a firearm. This will do nothing to stop crime and only infringe on good people. You will lose my vote if you support gun control.

2507 2018-03-07 05:06:56 You’re right “thoughts and prayers “ don’t bring back anyone and is very condescending to those who have lost a child or any family member, banning bump stocks is ONE small step but at least it is a step! #keepitmoving

2518 2018-03-07 04:57:00 You just proved my point. Bump stocks are property. Outright confiscation of property is a violation of Due Process. The federal nor State has the authority to ban anything, as it comes under ex post facto restrictions in the uS Constitution.

2523 2018-03-07 04:55:23 Should stocks fail 2 exceed the 1/26/18 highs, & fall out of the rising trend-channel from 2015, then we would have evidence, worst-case scenario is unfolding. If stocks rise above their Jan highs, best-case scenario is unfolding. Either case, a powerful move is coming. McHugh

We need a 20-30% correction worse than ever to remind everyone of risk
2652 2018-03-07 03:45:22 Banning bump stocks does exactly nothing in stopping or slowing an attacker. A gun can still be rapid fired without it, and with it, the gun is less stable and more inaccurate.

I don't own a bump stock and don't want to, so I don't care if they're banned. But it does nothing.

Here’s my official stance on gun control:

Automatic guns- Ban
Guns with burst-fire- Ban
Adjustable-fire guns (assuming they have an auto or burst mode)- Ban
Bump stocks- Ban

AR-15s- Keep legal, but raise age to 21
Semi-auto rifles- Keep legal
Semi-auto pistols- Keep legal

2695 2018-03-07 03:28:33 So when are knives going to be banned?  They have been responsible for more deaths than bump stocks.

2725 2018-03-07 03:15:55 I own guns but as a gun owner I recognize the responsibility perhaps far better than non-gun owners. I don't think my rights are infringed by stronger background checks, by banning assault weapons (or at least bump stocks) nor raising the age one can buy a gun to 21, do you?
2726 2018-03-07 03:15:33 No. Words won’t stop them. But what about comprehensive background checks? Or mental health screenings? Or banning parts like bump stocks that make certain guns even more dangerous? There’s a lot more we can do other than just handing teachers guns.

2732 2018-03-07 03:12:42 Jase you are wrong. An AR15 is actually a great hunting rifle, and it’s really especially great for women and children because it has very little kick and the collapsable stocks fit short arms.

2806 2018-03-07 02:43:51 Sideways is frustrating, but you can find stocks that work (though I tend to get skittish and want out ASAP).  Down, it's harder to find stocks that work.

2809 2018-03-07 02:43:12 Penny stocks (stocks trading at less than $5 per share) are a risky, but with some research potentially huge returning investment.

2840 2018-03-07 02:29:20 18 year olds can vote, enlist in the military but you wanma take away their right to own a gun as a civilian? Also banning bump stocks wont impact or change anything, you can bump fire with a finger and many other things, and if a criminal wants it, theyll get it.
2841 2018-03-07 02:29:16 Nope. Leading growth stocks.
2842 2018-03-07 02:29:03 As a @WSJ story pointed out, withdrawing from those stocks may be PC but not necessarily sound investing. But I suppose Mr. Kennedy need not worry about that as much.
2843 2018-03-07 02:28:33 Indeed. It’s one thing not to quibble about ‘magazine’ vs ‘clip’ or what exactly AR means, but, really… There is too far. The shoulder thing that goes up. “Collapsible stocks are evil.” “Silencers make guns practically inaudible.”

2848 2018-03-07 02:25:05 I irks me that billionaires that get paid for doing no work (just because of accumulated wealth — stocks and interest and the like) deride the idea of basic income because people would just “mooch” off the economy.
2849 2018-03-07 02:24:18 The cuts, stocks (don’t even start) the negotiations for businesses, the steel,coal,plans for infrastructure, trade, trade, trade.  It’s all interconnected and on a roll.
2850 2018-03-07 02:23:57 I don’t understand this post. There are already background checks. What would be the purpose of banning bump stocks?
2851 2018-03-07 02:23:13 It's been two weeks and I still haven't bought a single stock for the long term, only puts. The S&P is weakening, and the Hang Seng is flirting with the 30,000 mark. #trade #global #stocks

2857 2018-03-07 02:18:54 Y'all do know Carl Ichan likely got insider information and dumped $31 million in steel stocks RIIIIIGGGHHHHHT before the "announcement".

2859 2018-03-07 02:18:37 @jimcramer   My guess is that Gary Cohn departure will have zero impact on the market tomorrow. Gary was overruled, felt trivialized n left.  The tariff story is 2 days old.  Another opportunity to pick up stocks in the morning pre-trade am when weak souls dump out of fear.
2860 2018-03-07 02:18:11 Nice. I been doing this after the owner of Crayfish Fridaze recommended it. When it reaches in the thousands I invest it in stocks and unit funds.

2862 2018-03-07 02:17:48 Bolton was at the White House today. Holy Shit. Buy defense stocks and sell humanity's continued existence short.
2863 2018-03-07 02:17:17 mate I have a few funders you need to meet so they can explain VC, because it's far less stable than day trading penny stocks. You are giving me examples of luck, not work.
2864 2018-03-07 02:17:09 This would bring perfect opportunity to buy your favorite stocks on sale but stocks are the only thing people don’t buy on sale.
2865 2018-03-07 02:17:03 May I suggest, Trump wants volatility in the stock market. It causes day traders, 401k investors, IRA/IRRA folks to panic and sell stocks/move to a safer stock. Then, his friends on Wall Street pick up shares. Wall Street scammers are gone like the mafia is gone. Alive and well.
2866 2018-03-07 02:16:55 Omg.    Stocks are going higher.  Pension funds and investors are making money.   Omg.     Omg.       Cap ex is up huge also.     Cut the partisan bullshit.      Hacks

2872 2018-03-07 02:13:31 How to cope with market?

Very simple

Just increase holding period
If you are holding stocks for one month then make it 6 month.

If holding for 6 month,
Make it one year.

Avoid checking daily stocks prices

2875 2018-03-07 02:12:43 Banning bump stocks is a feel-good piece of legislation when you can achieve the same effect with the belt loop on your pants. We need tighter gun control but this is not the way to do it
2876 2018-03-07 02:12:04 Is averaging more at lower levels 4 momentum portfolio in sync w momentum philosophy? (Which is based on buying at highs). As a value investor adding more at lower levels makes perfect sense 2 me but have struggled w/the concept 4 momentum stocks.

2881 2018-03-07 02:08:56 There is something happening in ADAG stocks.

Either it is corporate internecine warfare trying to kill the stocks, or it is the operators trying to accumulate and jack up the price but without success.

IMO, some good or bad news should hit ADAG stocks soon. Be on sidelines

2886 2018-03-07 02:04:56 he does not care about anyone but his family empire and his rich friends..how many dumped stocks b4 Trump announced tariffs. if that is not inside trading I don't know what is...the Trump Mafia is as crooked as hell and needs to tumble

2888 2018-03-07 02:02:44 I’m certain that our “law and order” @POTUS will have her flogged and placed in the stocks and exposed to public ridicule on the South Lawn. Or simply told not to do it again... again.

2891 2018-03-07 02:01:26 Stocks hit by fears over White House economic policy...
2892 2018-03-07 02:00:35 (My niece left notes, too. Also puts out fairy houses every summer and stocks them with seeds and fruit.)
2893 2018-03-07 02:00:28 Wow I didn't know that trump changed parties that many times. Anyway I have stocks, and I don't think it was a good idea for trump to go against his economic adviser.
2894 2018-03-07 01:59:58 my (tinhat) theory is that there will be nothing done about them..it was a ploy for his buddy icahn to make a tidy profit selling off his steel stocks and then, when they tanked, bought them back at a discount
2895 2018-03-07 01:59:39 we hope you'll continue to work for more measures, because you know, as well as we, that bump stocks are a small part of the problem. progress yes, but far from enough. Hey, we're dying out here! #NeverAgain
2896 2018-03-07 01:57:41 Well it's worthy of investigation I think to at least determine if he sold/shorted any stocks prior to this event.  :)
2897 2018-03-07 01:57:13 Banning bump stocks is a silly attempt to pacify progressives. Per a former military knowledgeable in weapons, a bump stock can be made from a belt.

Silly, silly, silly, ...

The stock market is fluctuating like crazy because Donald Trump is a fucking dingus, and if you HAVE stocks, then you’re affected. Surprise!
2934 2018-03-07 01:30:53 Today the NYS Assembly passed bills to ban bump stocks, protect people from domestic abusers, & prevent those with mental illness from getting their hands on guns.

2936 2018-03-07 01:30:39 You need to spend something in exchange for something let it be time,abilitties or money. You put stocks of  your company in Sale in order for people to invest in it. Someone else gives you capital(so you can grow) in exchange for being the owner of the part of the company.
2937 2018-03-07 01:30:32 Day 1. Stocks fall because of Trump tariff will create trade war.
Day 2. Stock rise because Trump ease fear of trade war
Day 3. Stock rise modestly because investor is in opposition of Trump tariff.

See how the media has no credible thought process? This is fox, others worse.

2. Trump’s buddy #CarlIcahn shorted $31m in steel stocks.
3. #Putin’s buddy #Derepaska shorted shares in Rusal,
(both 2 & 3 just before Trump announced tariffs.)

2945 2018-03-07 01:24:38 Who helped him? Where are the videos? Could there have been more than one shooter? Were bump stocks used? We just don't know for sure, do we.  This law banning bump stock is a feel good law and does nothing to stop those with evil intent.
2946 2018-03-07 01:24:33 Peter Navarro is a fringe economist, and liberal academic, with zero business experience.  Gary Cohn is a center-right successful business executive.  No wonder stocks are down sharply tonight.  Navarro is running economic policy and Cohn wisely resigned.
2947 2018-03-07 01:24:27 Looks like Agent Orange's trade war made stocks go down in after hours trading again.
2948 2018-03-07 01:24:11 Where is your ban on bump stocks Trump the Stump? Oh, you never wrote it because you're afraid of the NRA. They gave you $30M and now you're beholden to them. You have no balls. Same with the GOP. They are afraid also. You're all a bunch of weenies.
2949 2018-03-07 01:24:00 What would happen if a larger percentage of people of color, decided to go out and start purchasing assault weapons, bump stocks in the next 30 days?  We would get legislation introduced and passed in 30 minutes!!!!

2952 2018-03-07 01:22:27 So how many times have bump stocks been used in shootings? And the fact you can do the same with belts, shoelaces,  shoulders, Jerry Miculek? As far as Vegas goes, we need more info before using it as an example. How many people were shot? Because it was not all of them.
2953 2018-03-07 01:22:15 Yes, with bans on high capacity magazines, insurance, age limits, and no bump stocks
2954 2018-03-07 01:22:10 Automatic weapons have been banned since the 50's what you mean is semi automatic weapons.  
I do agree that bump stocks should be banned since they can make the semi automatic automatic.
2955 2018-03-07 01:21:52 I totally should . But I know nothing about stocks . Wanna teach me ?
2956 2018-03-07 01:21:51 You truly are a moron @govinslee for waiting your time and our money with banning bump stocks
2957 2018-03-07 01:21:48 Indexing is all the rage on Wall Street, and it makes sense, when, for example, an equity index is replicating 500 different stocks.  But what is the point of an index that tracks just 4 coins (#LTC, #BTC, #BCH, #ETH)?

3013 2018-03-07 00:57:37 It’s pretty simple. It goes like this. Bump stocks are illegal to buy. Period. Kinda like a bomb or a grenade .. simple like that

3117 2018-03-07 00:14:11 S&P future -1.08%, Nasdaq future -1.15% afterhours on Gary Cohn resignation from White House. $NFLX -2.6% from its regular session close #stocks
3118 2018-03-07 00:14:05 An aquisition for stock $PSIX has been executed #pennyStocks #stocks #MergerAgreement #Trade #StockTrading
3119 2018-03-07 00:12:51 Asia stocks begin negative amid losses in US equity futures with markets spooked after another high-profile White House resignation in which top economic adviser Gary Cohn is to quit.
3120 2018-03-07 00:11:31 Putting a whipping boy in the stocks seemed part of the set-up for #CopOnTerfs. The irony is, he didn't express a view but spoke to two women who did.

Selecting a whipping boy avoids directly confronting those with opposing views, presenting an easier surrogate target instead.

3122 2018-03-07 00:10:52 Bump stocks are property of the person who owns them. Governments also have no authority to outlaw and then confiscate an Individual's property. That is considered theft and a violation of Due Process as well. Not to mention no authority to ban anything.
3123 2018-03-07 00:09:11 And it’s probably equipped with one of those rapey bump and grind stocks ..
3124 2018-03-07 00:09:08 And now everybody is all of sudden bearish_ 'c' wave correction is here we are going down get ready for the real correction phase #es_f #nasdaq #dow #stocks (this why you cannot simply recommend to just buy the dip, consensus once again wrong!)
3125 2018-03-07 00:07:27 Actually no, just assault weapons and bump stocks.  I don’t have an issue with guns just weapons of mass killing.  For example, I support alcohol being legal but not heroin.  Common sense laws
3126 2018-03-07 00:05:37 Bump stocks are now illegal in WA state. 
Changing the world one state at a time.

3128 2018-03-07 00:04:19 Stocks plummeting due to Cohns departure.  Your tariffs are a massively bad idea that will actually cost jobs, farming exports, and our economy in general just to protect the steel oligarchs that you're beholden to.
3129 2018-03-07 00:03:45 I'm rooting for #Viva to pursue Maine once her contract expires.
Viva listens to fans too. @VivaArtists nag-IPO na ba kayo? Bibili ako stocks niyo if Maine signed up sa inyo.
Turn all Maine's dream projects into a reality. :) Thank you!
3130 2018-03-07 00:02:53 @FedEx your stocks will go up and your customer base will grow.
3131 2018-03-07 00:02:47 I’m just lucky to have enough Russian neighbors that the bodega stocks it. NYC is the city of 1000 beers 
3132 2018-03-07 00:02:43 Today is a good day for @TIAA to donate $1 million (nice) AND to show support for teachers and students by divesting all gun stocks. #neveragain #TeachersAndGunsDontMix #teachers
3133 2018-03-07 00:01:25 You're so helpful. I have a question also. If the stocks hits say 2.00$, does that mean I can exercise it at 1.75$ ?
3134 2018-03-07 00:00:56 Bitch, stick to Smash 4, and losing by 4 stocks
3135 2018-03-07 00:00:37 It will always be better than an index fund based on 4 very volatile stocks. Tartuffe
3136 2018-03-07 00:00:27 @Walmart it never fails to amaze me how disappointing my trips to WM are these days (out of stocks, down pharmacy, down registers). It seems that nobody is paying attention to the physical stores anymore :(
3137 2018-03-07 00:00:10 They're also bombing trade- and takeover-wise in Europe, Goldman Sachs bought 8% of the states shares in it's power company DONG () they recently sold the stocks with around $2 billion or 155% in profits.
