Oil could be back to US$45 a barrel within 12 months, Citigroup’s commodities chief Ed Morse said in an interview with the Financial Post, noting that the bullish case for crude is based on a faulty analysis.

11 2018-07-26 23:08:09 That's the nature of commodities. Why not invest in the infrastructure while you can make money and then it's there. You can make this same argument for any product say like steel. Why ship any product overseas then?
12 2018-07-26 23:06:47 those are modern, capitalist countries though. it's not like they're just dumping plastic into the water for the fun of it, it's inextricably tied up with the mode of production, the creation of commodities, etc.
13 2018-07-26 23:04:51 I don’t think it’s that simple Michael. My point is that when supply exceeds demand, prices collapse (especially for commodities), and there is then a protracted contest for market share. Those who have paid back capital costs & can also minimize labour costs, survive longest.

40 2018-07-26 22:18:29 No sir. The so-called black woman is held at a higher regard than the so-called black man today. We have to realize that we're all commodities in America they put the so-called black men in jail because he's viewed as a stock option. Let's be real. We "black" men are the targets.
41 2018-07-26 22:14:50 Eso se llama "commodities trading" en ingles y es super-especulativo, casi tan "chinguear" como la loteria.
42 2018-07-26 22:12:59 Plenty of other commodities fit that. But did you read the Van Eck CBOE proposal? They are buying OTC from regulated institutions using an OTC regulated pricing mechanism. Someone dumping on Binance won’t really hurt that price. It’s a totally different price than what is on CMC

45 2018-07-26 21:58:13 China stops trade talks. Canada and Mexico standing firm, no deal even close for NAFA, both leaders publicly counter attacking Trump personally. 12 billion tax payer bail out for Trumps tariffs on Midwest farm commodities. Now let’s talk about the Trump deficit and budget.
46 2018-07-26 21:56:50 “Capital is money, capital is commodities. By virtue of it being value, it has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or, at the least, lays golden eggs.” — Marx
47 2018-07-26 21:55:38 Se isso não é uma evidência de grande ciclo de commodities, o que mais seria?
48 2018-07-26 21:52:23 So now I’m paying more for commodities while at the same time paying taxes to bail out farmers who are getting hammered by tariffs enacted by a man they voted for.
49 2018-07-26 21:49:38 Le aste erano nate per le commodities. Ma sono finite sul food molto rapidamente. Già 15 anni orsono asta al ribasso sulle marmellate per Lombardini. Lo so perché il tasto "meno" lo schiacciavo io, allora country manager di multinazionale del settore. Avvilente e svilente.
50 2018-07-26 21:46:06 No its not. It's a global #heatwave of unprecedented proportion. Crops are failing across the world. Prices spiking on commodities markets. More people will go hungry as a result. It won't be long before it is us. Wake the hell up!
51 2018-07-26 21:45:51 We don't normally export a great deal of agricultural commodities to #EU because of their non-tariff barriers erected specifically against #USA to prevent them from losing their own farms. Must be nice to feel wanted. #California certainly doesn't make farmers feel wanted.
52 2018-07-26 21:45:01 Insane. Crops are failing across the world. Prices spiking on commodities markets. More people will go hungry as a result. This isn't just a blip. It won't be long before it is us. Wake the hell up!

54 2018-07-26 21:42:28 When has collectivism gone sour? When in control by a bureaucratic state? Absolutely. The problem with a market solution is that there isn't one when the commodities in question are life and death in their implications. I would absolutely be for a voluntary exit.
55 2018-07-26 21:42:00 English fans aren't fans, they re commodities.
56 2018-07-26 21:38:59 Brands aren't commodities tho - that's the whole idea of them. And Budweiser/Budvar Budweiser have been squabbling over their names continuously for decades. There are plenty of countries where you can't buy them both, so it's not a good example IMO.
57 2018-07-26 21:38:32 But real world events US & Europe fruit crops like lemons, vegetable crops across EU and UK, grain crops like Russian wheat all down, prices spiking on commodities markets. Crops like US cotton too. So, when does the deviation start to matter? After we're all dead?

60 2018-07-26 21:19:11 All The fuss of Trump about tariffs to EU is actually about ranting from them by selling gas, commodities etc. European countries are toyed...
61 2018-07-26 21:17:13 I must say, the idea of a chimpanzee dairy farm is pretty nightmarish. What do you think, Deane? And if you'd disapprove, could you name the characteristic possessed by all chimpanzees, but no cows, which makes it uniquely wrong to farm them for commodities like flesh and milk?
62 2018-07-26 21:14:15 So much of the coverage is about lack of access for EU farmers. That's bad but, as you note, this ECJ action will limit the range of traits in globally traded commodities to those that can make enough $ to pay for regulatory work.
63 2018-07-26 21:14:13 you can approach the same thing through the other side, as capital strengthening the relative position of commodities and thus women.

69 2018-07-26 20:44:48 Ginrai-you don’t get it because you do not have the mind of a business man— which can change from one moment to another depending on the price — like the commodities market and like Trump—Politicians have a lot of problems with this!!
70 2018-07-26 20:41:40 If i should meet Buhari in person, I want to ask him why prices of commodities skyrocketed shortly after he came in.

84 2018-07-26 19:56:05 It really is a shame the position the #Mets have put themselves in. Viable trade commodities who are NOT rentals that should be a part of a successful team. Instead, they're probably going to have to trade them. Outside of deGrom, Wheeler is the guy that could net something nice.

And in government the rarest of commodities.
88 2018-07-26 19:43:55 Important to note:
Chinese built infrastructure in Africa.
Prices we received for our commodities determined by Western bourses. 
Where our president even got it wrong.Thought Russia sets oil prices.

89 2018-07-26 19:29:10 In the early 1970's I was being pronounced dead. I got up. Five years later I was told to lower my academic standards. I have lectured on topics ranging from commodities, finance to health and referenced in journals.

95 2018-07-26 19:00:53 Oh no nothing, just confirming with a screenshot. I do get your point, but the thing is that people will look for better opportunities instead of stock markets: commodities etc. Could be that crypto is that too, given TA. Just raising a point.
96 2018-07-26 18:58:40 Think big. This may be part of an adoption racket where kids are kidnapped from parents, records lost, and then put out for adoption.

101 2018-07-26 18:34:09 The $USD is the ultimate currency for determining the Metal prices. No question about that.

Dollar goes up, all metals (or some commodities) goes down.  It is the inflation gauge, can't deny that.  Inflation drives the commodity prices.

$Yuan has been used a political tool now

121 2018-07-26 17:21:59 Acho que é isso mesmo... o noticiário local só serve para aumentar a força do movimento...

Mas quem define a direção são as commodities...
122 2018-07-26 17:17:38 Commodities take a long time to turn. No opec in Natgas.  Be patient.
123 2018-07-26 17:15:49 Also- most farms are like ours. They are family-owned and operated, but often are incorporated or LLCs for tax/business reasons. For most commodities, the "big business" aspect only comes in at the end of the process when farmers sell their crop to the larger company.
124 2018-07-26 17:15:33 Best thing about the 3rd World is no sycophant, shady commodities traders.
125 2018-07-26 17:14:22 @nitin_gadkari @CMOMaharashtra @PiyushGoyalOffc @PMOIndia Please look into transport strike. Today is 7th day and people are facing acute shortages of essential commodities including health care products. Situation is aggravating after every passing day. Pl tk it on priority
126 2018-07-26 17:10:35 I am from a family farm and I echo almost everything Lucus F. said. We operate about 1,000 acres of corn, soybeans, and alfalfa. We also care for 60 beef cows and their calves. My family is being hurt by tariffs dropping the prices of the commodities we are selling.
127 2018-07-26 17:04:59 Ninguém sabe explicar por que as commodities brasileiras estão derretendo, mesmo tendo guerra comercial entre China e EUA , o que beneficiaria o Brasil em termos de vendas. Por que as commodities daqui seguem Chicago?
128 2018-07-26 16:56:50 Tama. Taasan ang sintax, not the basic commodities.
129 2018-07-26 16:55:27 Should i invest in overseas commodities like Dua Lipa or Tove Styrke?

133 2018-07-26 16:48:10 They could not have done, you massive orange idiot. “They” are not a country. Countries choose what and where to but. The EU is an organisation. It does not buy or sell commodities. Truly you are a disgrace to the office.
134 2018-07-26 16:48:04 And over at Citigroup, commodities head Ed Morse said we could  see $45/bbl within 12 months.......pick your poison.
135 2018-07-26 16:47:25 No pueden. O es moneda o es bono  y las monedas no crean relación de propiedad con los commodities y los bonos si. Pero no son monedas.
136 2018-07-26 16:46:21 Supongo que creen que así pueden hacer una relación NO VINCULANTE contra algo para darle el valor de ese algo (petro) sin arriesgar los commodities.
137 2018-07-26 16:42:17 Yeah but Forex is based on Fiat currency though, even if only in part. While cryptos are pure digital. Perhaps the commodities system will have to adapt and evolve to accommodate this new type of asset. 
138 2018-07-26 16:40:50 @askGST_GoI On 21st July it has been resolved  that certain commodities will be exempt from tax. Plz clarify whether tax paid on such goods and being claimed as input tax credit will be forfeited or the dealer can claim refund of the same.
139 2018-07-26 16:35:19 Commendable work being done, however, couldn't identify the unit of measure in the commodities pricing. For example, white maize sold in Kagargo (june 2018) @ N 110 , is it per Kg or?
140 2018-07-26 16:31:02 We keep our own seed because we don’t buy from Monsanto. Like any business owner, a farmer has to weigh the pro’s and con’s of using their seed. Commodities market is a result of capitalism. There are a lot of technology companies out there, JD just likes to price gauge the most.
141 2018-07-26 16:20:58 Los bonos se anclan a los bonos que se anclan a los commodities y a valores. Porque se supone que los bonos/acciones son una representación vinculante (relación de propiedad) con los commodities y elementos de valor
142 2018-07-26 16:15:53 What about...not being allowed to save seed, being forced to get approval from govt for everything you plant, being held hostage by the commodities markets, John Deere's proprietary computer chips, separate facilities for gmo/non GMO...farmers relinquish a lot of control to corps
143 2018-07-26 16:12:26 Not sure why people are bringing up silver and gold. Those commodities are not thought of as a currency and they’ve been bad investments. At best they are inflation hedges. Either way @PeterLBrandt isn’t a fundamental exponential growth investor, which is the btc story right now
144 2018-07-26 16:05:09 Of course it is. Independent of their windfalls from commodities portfolios.
145 2018-07-26 16:01:33 Huge difference they are not Farms. Why compare a commodities broker to a farm? There are many large companies that are family owned, that does not take away from the fact 98% of Farms are family owned and run. Some are 40,000 farms, still family owned and operated.
146 2018-07-26 16:01:16 The 12 Billion will be divided among commodities among those three States but does not help those impacted by the tariffs like hog farmers or small parts etc! Direct payments will be  distributed by Federal govt!
147 2018-07-26 15:56:29 Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth.
148 2018-07-26 15:53:32 Apps or tools are commodities, that you need.  Value - Integrate data, applications & people together through a common business process. Think SI.
149 2018-07-26 15:52:08 You cannot compare an agri business like Cargil to a farm operation. One is a farm no matter what it's size the other is a commodities broker. And Cargil is still family owned and operated but like I said not a farm whatsoever.

151 2018-07-26 15:48:09 @SRuhle These welfare payments aren’t going to “farmers” , they’re going to corporate entities that sell agricultural commodities.
152 2018-07-26 15:45:00 We do trade with India, just don't accept it. Tons of perishable goods, commodities exchanged via wahgah border daily. I heard couple weeks ago arm of military org have got contract to supply gypsum to saint gobain plants in India. Haven't been able to verify it though.
153 2018-07-26 15:44:23 When I was 19, there were no cell phones, internet nor Grindr. Yet, I had more action without all these commodities.
154 2018-07-26 15:43:32 Cream rises though and a lot of secon year receivers (including Sharpe), so they aren’t proven commodities yet. I’m optimistic but agree, no certainty yet
155 2018-07-26 15:37:46 Wikipedia states: Some of Cargill's major businesses are trading, purchasing and distributing grain and other agricultural commodities, such as palm oil; trading in energy, steel & transport; the raising of livestock and production of feed;
156 2018-07-26 15:34:43 Trump thinks he's being strategic on tariffs. It seems tied to removing sanctions. He calls himself an economist. Is he causing prices to be raised on our allies so we consumers feel pressure to remove sanctions? He would then save us w/ access to cheaper Russian commodities! Hmm
157 2018-07-26 15:28:50 Yo pensaba que era por el tipo de cambio real, por el precio de los commodities y por la caída en la IED querido Gus.
158 2018-07-26 15:23:59 I wish I believed that was all it is. My experience has shown me there is a War on commodities fueled by repeal of the Uptick Rule, HFT, collusion. Hope I am wrong.

171 2018-07-26 14:59:00 Right. So you're telling me that the people as a whole, in Laos and Venezuela, own the means of production and they no longer need to buy the commodities that they produce? Is that what you're saying?
172 2018-07-26 14:56:03 Pelo menos usou a cabeça dessa vez. Agregar valor à commodities é essencial para aumentar nossa industrialização e o valor dos nossos produtos.

175 2018-07-26 14:38:18 @cspanradio Listening to the US trade ambassador complaining about trade deficits. We buy commodities from a cheaper source.  We refuse to put our labor to work and subsidize new industry because it disrupts legacy businesses where we are no longer competitive or provide value.
176 2018-07-26 14:33:51 We know that China will be a long-term consumer of natural gas and agricultural commodities..so while I get they’ll put out some tough rhetoric on trade, at the end of the day, they have heck of a lot of people they are responsible for and will need to provide for ..
177 2018-07-26 14:30:15 Starting to wonder if #brexit is an advanced version of 'The Big Short'. Buy up commodities prior a 'stockpiling', push up the price of said commodities, cancel Brexit, make money on the difference the subsequent economic boom will create.

181 2018-07-26 14:16:31 I honestly think that we are in a war on commodities with the primary weapons being the repeal of the Uptick Rule & HFT. Keep a low headline number for inflation saves the State massive amounts of money in funding cost on debt & COLA. Fed book would get destroyed by higher rates.
182 2018-07-26 14:11:15 More people are beginning to challenge the capitalist notion that healthcare and education are commodities that should be paid for in the marketplace.
183 2018-07-26 14:09:40 Tracking - but how could i capm apply to cross sectional returns bonds, currencies or commodities?  That is the question in my mind - q^5 makes sense that it would subsume traditional factor models in stocks...but traditional factor models work lots of other places.
184 2018-07-26 14:07:55 That's because the grain prices, i.e. corn, haven't risen proportionally since the 30s- abt $1/bushel. It's $3.63 today. It's controlled by the commodities market. And the government stockpiles grain for emergencies & keeps the cost low. Imagine if car prices rose only 300%. 1/

189 2018-07-26 13:53:47 Differing view point...

Unfort, maybe so many good indies is the problem as much as anything.

Like selling grains of sand. Not much demand for them individ, but there are a lot

Majors are selling specialty products vs commodities.  hugely $$ invest. Why they need “sure things”
190 2018-07-26 13:53:07 Jornal de forrar gaiola não entendeu que a taxação dessas commodities foi como colocar o bode na sala da EU? E que agora Trump conseguiu o que queria, derrubando o protecionismo europeu?
191 2018-07-26 13:52:07 Thanks for the question Carly, we have an ambitious expansion plan & intend to cover 70% exports of forest-risk commodities by 2020. We're focusing on countries where commodity expansion leads to deforestation at the moment #AskTrase
192 2018-07-26 13:50:39 Ironically, farmers are the least deserving group harmed by Trump's tariffs. Unless one assumes that worldwide demand for their commodities falls, their reduction in sales is 100% temporary--they will just sell in different markets than they do now for the same price.

194 2018-07-26 13:41:36 So, 45* creates a problem, where one did not exist, with tariffs. When tariffs hit farmers because markets shift to lower prices commodities they offer a $12M bribe to tamp down the fire. 

Are we Great yet? 
195 2018-07-26 13:37:33 Will Trase data expand to show other countries such as #USA?
A:We have an ambitious expansion plan & intend to cover 70% exports of forest-risk commodities by 2020. We're focusing on countries where commodity expansion leads to deforestation, so the USA is not on the list (yet!)
196 2018-07-26 13:35:13 The rising inflation of the prices of basic commodities must be solved talaga para 'yon ay mapababa. If it will be lowered and controlled, then ang buhay nang mga Pilipino ay kay saya. And the economy will be saved from its negative impact.

198 2018-07-26 13:32:39 Companies will begin paying significantly more for commodities because EU leaders like you? @realDonaldTrump  .. go lie down.
199 2018-07-26 13:31:39 I don't know the answer to this but maybe some of you do: What happens to the billions of animals raised for food, when their value as commodities suddenly sinks? What are the animal welfare implications of this trade war?
200 2018-07-26 13:31:26 Or do one on the digital economy of virtual cosmetics for games like TF2, Dota 2, and counterstrike. People trading virtual hats and scarves like they’re commodities on the stock exchange—shit’s WILD
201 2018-07-26 13:30:43 It should be enough to shame and damp and person but Trump is neither he is a failed businessman who is constantly looking for the next deal, sadly for America it's , its people and integrity, to Trump these are commodities that are up for sale.
202 2018-07-26 13:28:28 I will never not be salty about how American Airlines overcharges you for basic commodities.
203 2018-07-26 13:21:50 The government is buying up commodities at much higher prices than they are worth on the free market in order to keep (corporate) farmers afloat -that's a bailout.

205 2018-07-26 13:14:35 What are some alternatives that might work? What is a viable theory of change and robust strategy for decoupling deforestation from commodities (soy, beef, palm oil and pulp are responsible for 70% of deforestation). What is flawed with market-based mechanisms that we could fix?
206 2018-07-26 13:13:49 Meaning they cut expenses by 30%, kept the same income, and pocket the difference. This works because lettuce production is so concentrated. But if the subsidies were removed, you would see production cuts in all commodities.

208 2018-07-26 13:06:37 Not sure I agree.  We’re talking about the asset being traded not the underlying network.  For example, $xrp has basically nothing to do with the network itself.  I don’t have a good answer (commodities markets have no “market cap”) either, though.

236 2018-07-26 11:47:22 Congratz. Exporting agricultural and basic commodities while importing luxury cars is really a deal of a very stable genius. Or an average African dictator from 1980s...
237 2018-07-26 11:47:06 Trump's socialism: "U.S... will utilize a Great Depression-era law to send payments to producers of dairy, hogs & certain crops. It will also purchase surpluses of commodities including fruits, nuts, rice, beef, pork & milk & distribute them to food banks & other nutrition prog."

239 2018-07-26 11:41:11 It’s nothing about gender stop reporting in that way. They are high level “celebrity “ status and expect luxury, plus they are high level commodities for the club, and are a higher priority, it would be the same with first team and youth team for instance

243 2018-07-26 11:26:18 Trust me...they do it to American women, too. Blond-haired, blue-eyed children and infants, especially newborns are hot commodities within the child welfare system.  The government targets the impoverished for their children.

255 2018-07-26 10:18:54 Early tomorrow morning we leave #Australia. Will be sad to go. Amazing country and such a warm welcome everywhere we went.  Australia has such amazing potential. It is so rich in foodstuffs, commodities and virtually everything. Thank you and hope to see you soon 
256 2018-07-26 10:16:06 AFAIK tariffs on soy-beans are already zero, and the EU is not in the business to purchase staple commodities. EU member states might very well buy more soybeans as tariffs with China means US producers have to target European markets.
257 2018-07-26 10:15:19 Not usually at least, but a global shortage of feedstuffs is reflected in barley prices, not that many Spring growers will be in a position to take advantage. All of which underlines the vulnerability of trading essential foodstuffs as commodities. Empty shelves are beckoning.
258 2018-07-26 10:10:36 Only if the Chinese customs authorities want it that way. 

Agricultural commodities come with extensive documentation on where they were grown and how, in order to meet sanitary and phytosanitary requirements at the border. 

Transhipping to avoid tariffs isn't THAT easy.
259 2018-07-26 10:07:38 Why oh why must you exaggerate and bend the facts? Juncker does not have the authority to negotiate any purchases or promise to purchase any commodities. Allow me to educate you and your supporters once again.
260 2018-07-26 10:01:30 The limitation is how much money we need... Any more money we don't need is called inflation. Right now there is something like 100T dollars worth of wealth in the world between currencies, commodities, savings accounts, etc. What happens when you print 100x that much money?

269 2018-07-26 08:31:09 Aye, but what is the other side of that coin? It's that the UK imports from the EU by necessity about half the commodities we need as a nation to survive. These data do not give us any stronger a hand than they give the EU.

277 2018-07-26 07:55:43 Increasing tariffs on commodities from poor nations can have negative effects on their poor producers.  This could be seen as a regressive tax (that is, tax taking a higher % of tax revenue from those on low incomes in those nations).  E.g. Tariffs on orange imports from Africa.

281 2018-07-26 07:36:00 What’s disgusting is the false equivalence between wage labor and bodies as commodities libfems pull.  Like, the output of your labor is where the value is generated and extracted from by a capitalist.  In sex work YOU are the commodity, not your labor.  Creeps.

284 2018-07-26 07:16:56 Money is valueless. It doesnt have worth or value without the things it tends to buy. Meaning? You can't fight inflation by shorting the supply of money in the market. The prices of Commodities and Services are the key drivers of inflation.

296 2018-07-26 06:25:00 There has been a big debate on if futures prices affect spot price. For S&P 500, Gold and other commodities. There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that futures affect spot price. Which should be the case. That said if the price is manipulated then there is a case to be made.
297 2018-07-26 06:18:57 quite familiar with Trumps negotiating style, and commodities is my field. No need to sensationalize Trumps spectacular failures, he does it himself. Already the WH has walked back rhetoric on the very meeting we r discussing. Now they have ‘agreed to hold talks about tariffs.
298 2018-07-26 06:06:40 Mr Trump said the EU has agreed to start “almost immediately” buying “a lot more” US soyabeans, one of the main commodities targeted by China in its response to US tariffs. The bloc also would become a “massive buyer” of US liquefied natural gas.

344 2018-07-26 02:25:02 They were already going to import soybeans (no tariffs exist), and this will not offset the China/Canada problems (which you also created). Also, EU reps don't buy commodities. They walked in, schooled you, and made you look like an idiot. Business as usual. Resign.

349 2018-07-26 02:00:23 “...It is the consequence of a progressively universal conditioning of the individual to be someone who faces the glittering marketplace. The most important societal imperative is to ensure that all real individuality is dependent on the circulation of commodities.” Badiou 
350 2018-07-26 01:58:03 dapat nga lahat na ng basic commodities lagyan ng srp
351 2018-07-26 01:56:50 And the higher ups (bettman) are being underhanded about taking care if it's assets (players). Nothing but commodities to them. Pretty sh*tty stuff
352 2018-07-26 01:54:11 USD Group including commodities which is priced in USD should see strength at least 1 more leg #elliottwave
353 2018-07-26 01:45:36 Time to start investing in commodities. lol
354 2018-07-26 01:42:13 I don't have proof that it happened.  Just my word.  I tweeted about tech companies data mining us and treating people like commodities.  "Commodities don't have rights".  That tweet never showed up.  There were a few others.
355 2018-07-26 01:37:53 China es el problema, sobre todo cuando sube la tasa de renta americana de 1,6% a 3% a 10 años, habrá más defaults en CHN y el yuan tenderá a devaluar ...lo que nos espera siendo el mayor comprador de commodities del mundo..mientras UY súper caro, sigue gastando y endeudándose
356 2018-07-26 01:35:48 we too belong in this world / listened to its first songs / made music from the humblest of things / and understood that people are not / commodities / but sparks of the divine / set in motion / in a perfect dance...

357 2018-07-26 01:33:40 You really need to pay attention. A) I was making the point that we didn't get enough for these guys when they were valuable commodities (ie. "prospects"). B) Hoffman is at Coors, so you really don't know what he would have been as a jay, but thats not my point
358 2018-07-26 01:19:22 Cut drugs out of your life and you will no longer feel neurological attached to capitalist commodities.
359 2018-07-26 01:18:54 Sure, if you ignore the redacted FBI release backed Nunes's memo, the heaps of evidence against StrZok, Comey, Hillary, the DoJ, the FBI, Brennan, etc? Willful ignorance and blind hatred are not commodities in the real world.

361 2018-07-26 01:13:48 Sobre el Bs.S. y su Anclaje al Petro:
Un Bs. S. Anclado al Petro (Oro, Petróleo - Minerales) significa mayor capacidad de maniobra en la política monetaria. Un Anclaje al precio de exportación de estos Commodities brindan estabilidad y paridad como AUTORIDAD monetaria.
362 2018-07-26 01:09:49 Commodities are the way to export prosperity!  Just ask the third world!
363 2018-07-26 01:08:53 Bueno, vendamos el kg de carne a 200.000US$...Cómo?! ¿No manejamos el precio de los commodities? Que macana
364 2018-07-26 01:01:50 SCUM: Vitriol commodities, not characters.
365 2018-07-26 00:59:53 totally agree - I wrote about how the change in China should bring people back to these names - local, adrs, and commodities
366 2018-07-26 00:59:03 Não é novo, de fato, mas a situação agora é mais mais complicada do que quando o Lula pegou em 2003. E lá ainda tinha boom de commodities.
367 2018-07-26 00:57:29 The $16k+ over the next 10 years saved by the tax cuts, doesn't account for the large increases in costs of commodities, the cost of manufactured goods, or the costs of services attributable to tariffs.
368 2018-07-26 00:55:45 If you are interested in commodities and their markets. A great source of information is Andrew Hecht who writes on Seeking Alpha. You could follow him and he will keep you well apprised and suggest ideas. I do not know him personally.
369 2018-07-26 00:53:16 Marx thinks money is a stand-in for exchange vale, which is equivalent to labor. "As exchange-values, all commodities are merely definite quantities of congealed labour-time" I think "not being paid the full value of their work" is a reasonable way to sum that up.
370 2018-07-26 00:48:00 @RCPWindsor @windsor_rino @donmerrifieldjr isn't making his point very well . Condos, from a real estate perspective are more "luxury" purchases more than family homes are. So they tend to only be hot commodities when the market picks up, i.e. now in Windsor.
371 2018-07-26 00:40:38 It is not as small as it looks. Canada sells more commodities and the US more manufactured goods. Commodities can find alternative buyers a little more easily than manufacturing.
372 2018-07-26 00:35:52 #Trump and his stupid tariffs are forcing the @USDA to buy up commodities. Is Trump going to bring back #government #cheese ?

374 2018-07-26 00:34:25 Es posible que incremente su tasa. Los precios de los commodities seguirán con esta tendencia.  Argentina no levanta y Brasil muestra muy poco avance.  La proyección de nuestra tasa serán la de seguir manteniendo sin variaciones?

376 2018-07-26 00:33:05 Jim, out of curiosity do you trade commodities or do you just follow the markets closely?
377 2018-07-26 00:30:37 Crude oil prices lifted after US data showed greater consumption than expected. A weakening US dollar gave the commodities complex a lift. Asia Pacific markets may outstrip the small rise seen in overnight futures trading  @MicMcCarthy_CMC
378 2018-07-26 00:29:57 I’m seeing some tweets from traders that are upset about trump and his Ag bailout deal. I find this amusing. It speaks volumes to why I don’t like them. Those that can’t farm.....trade commodities.  My comment, go secure a few million of capital and join the fun if it’s so easy.
379 2018-07-26 00:20:30 Great photo op! But, we can't see .@POTUS left hand - the one w the dagger in it! YOU're incapable of the CONCEPT of true love - only USAGE of PEOPLE - i.e. as commodities to be used & discarded which includes the .@WhiteHouse . VERY SAD & DANGEROUS for America! ;-(
380 2018-07-26 00:06:39 Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check.
